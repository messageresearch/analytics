[10:19] you God bless you tonight you'll be
[10:21] seated for a moment just want to get up
[10:24] at the beginning got a couple
[10:25] light-hearted things to share with you a
[10:27] couple
[10:28] announcements uh uh there's a brother in
[10:30] our church that I should have been
[10:32] wearing one tonight you've seen people
[10:33] around the campground wearing the little
[10:35] Cloud pins uh there's a brother Levi
[10:38] Bish from our church who makes those uh
[10:40] likes us to hand them out to Believers
[10:42] when we gives us to the gives them to
[10:44] the ministry when we travel around and
[10:46] things so there's going to be a box of
[10:47] them out there by the t-shirts those are
[10:49] complimentary I've been uh asked about
[10:51] them a few times so if you'd like one of
[10:53] those you can have one of those uh free
[10:55] of charge and amen and uh that's that's
[10:58] our headship
[10:59] that's our Lord up there amen we're
[11:02] we're uh we're happy to be identified
[11:04] with that
[11:06] cloud amen uh and also we want you those
[11:10] of you making travel plans and things uh
[11:13] every year if if it's your first time
[11:15] here every year there's a gathering at
[11:16] the mcnalty home uh for kind of the camp
[11:19] after party on Sunday afternoon so um if
[11:22] you if you can stay around that long you
[11:24] really don't want to miss that that's a
[11:25] wonderful time of Fellowship right after
[11:27] the camp so we'd like you to have that
[11:30] now some of the uh some of the boys here
[11:32] on the camp have asked me to to notify
[11:35] the church tonight that we've got a new
[11:39] rule there's unfortunately we we've had
[11:42] to add a rule those of you in the back
[11:44] uh what we do here we're a very new
[11:46] Youth Camp you see and so we don't have
[11:49] a lot of rules because what happens is
[11:51] you can kind of operate on mostly Common
[11:54] Sense until all of a sudden you need a
[11:57] rule so what we do is then when we have
[12:00] to come up with a new rule then we name
[12:01] it after the person who's responsible
[12:04] for the rules so now but would you ever
[12:07] imagine that we would need to have a
[12:09] rule against attempted vehicular
[12:16] manslaughter but uh unfortunately we've
[12:18] had to add the micaa
[12:20] rule this year and so you know uh we
[12:24] don't want you to run over your friends
[12:27] we don't want you to run over your
[12:28] enemies either that's against the rules
[12:32] so you know we've had a lot of bumps and
[12:34] bruises you know uh this weekend but by
[12:37] the grace of God no no serious injuries
[12:40] uh We've really kept sister Lily busy
[12:42] but um but we we are overcoming amen uh
[12:46] the Devil May fight but no weapon that
[12:49] he has will prosper against God's people
[12:51] so we're grateful we've had a wonderful
[12:53] day today on the campground we started
[12:55] out with a morning worship the presence
[12:57] of the Lord just came by
[12:59] amen we've had some some great
[13:01] activities got some funny pictures made
[13:03] some good memories hasn't it been a good
[13:05] day
[13:07] [Applause]
[13:11] amen yes

[13:36] spirit of a ball game you know so how
[13:38] come we can't get in the spirit of a
[13:40] service we like to do

[13:56] to be at Camp can you say Amen to that
[13:59] Hallelujah uh tonight on a serious note
[14:01] will be our prayer line
[14:03] service and uh so we're just asking that
[14:06] you would with your poll with your
[14:09] expectation amen enter in uh to this
[14:12] service with us because we're dealing
[14:14] with very great
[14:16] need the environment that our young
[14:19] people are overcoming in is darker than
[14:22] the world is ever
[14:23] seen amen there's there's very grave
[14:26] needs come through this prayer line
[14:27] every year uh I I think it was the first
[14:29] year a young lady came through the
[14:31] prayer line spoke to brother Andrew
[14:33] Spencer and and told him said brother
[14:35] Andrew if the Lord doesn't do something
[14:36] for me right now said then as soon as I
[14:40] get home I'm going to take my
[14:42] life amen and and that's that's how
[14:46] serious amen uh uh the condition can be
[14:49] that's that's how lives even hang in the
[14:51] balance of Deliverance services like
[14:53] this and so you know but that sister by
[14:56] the grace of God received her her
[14:59] Deliverance she's alive today amen
[15:01] pressing
[15:03] on no doubt still having battles still
[15:06] having struggles perhaps making mistakes
[15:09] but as we heard last night a true child
[15:11] of God they fall down but they get back
[15:14] up and they get back up again and they
[15:17] get back up again did you enjoy that
[15:19] word last night amen what a crucial what
[15:22] an important message that we
[15:24] heard
[15:26] amen we just praise the Lord so we're
[15:29] going to have this prayer line service
[15:30] uh we got a a team of brothers and
[15:32] sisters that we' worked with um to uh to
[15:36] to help with this and to uh just to
[15:38] administrate this we got the deacons
[15:40] directing things so so uh we just want
[15:44] to let you know we we have some people
[15:46] together uh uh to to do the work of the
[15:48] prayer line it's not to anybody's
[15:50] exclusion but to keep things orderly and
[15:52] efficient amen and and just stay out of
[15:54] the way of the moving of the spirit and
[15:57] and so we just ask you to join in Unity
[15:59] with us U we've had some afternoon
[16:01] sessions with our older youth with
[16:03] brother brother uh Aaron Oglesby brother
[16:05] Samuel Browning have done a tremendous
[16:07] job and it's amazing how they dovetailed
[16:09] together amen uh Friday afternoon
[16:12] brother Aaron spoke on unity and today
[16:15] brother Samuel spoke on
[16:18] individuality and you see that's how the
[16:20] unity of the spirit Works amen because
[16:23] we've come here to unite together in
[16:24] Fellowship but you've come from
[16:26] different places you've come from
[16:27] different churches different kind of
[16:29] Ministries that you've sat under and so
[16:32] we're a very diverse group today but our
[16:34] Oneness is not sameness but we are
[16:37] united under one head and when the head
[16:39] comes down on the body that headship the
[16:42] life of it flows through the body and
[16:44] every joint will supply in a unique way
[16:47] amen where nobody else can take your
[16:49] place even in this meeting you have a
[16:51] role to play and pulling on the word and
[16:53] creating an atmosphere amen and

[1:12:08] coliseums churches missions wherever he
[1:12:10] went but Lord he walked in there

[1:12:23] Victory and tonight Lord we know the
[1:12:25] devil has done everything he can to stop
[1:12:28] and hinder this group of young people
[1:12:30] but Lord greater is he that is in them
[1:12:32] than he that is in the opposition
[1:12:34] against them and Lord I know as we come

[1:14:03] want to go to the word of the lord we
[1:14:05] just have one place we want to read
[1:14:07] tonight in the Book of Romans the 8th
[1:14:08] chapter amen how many loves the Lord
[1:14:11] amen I believe the spirit of the Lord is
[1:14:13] moving Among Us in a special way this
[1:14:15] week and amen we thank the Lord for the
[1:14:17] for the platform to preach the message
[1:14:19] of the hour from here tonight amen
[1:14:21] Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 it's a
[1:14:24] very famili you're reading Amen to the
[1:14:26] Believers in Romans chap 8 and:
[1:14:29] 11 the Bible here says but if the spirit
[1:14:32] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:14:35] dead dwell in you so not around you or
[1:14:40] on you or above you but if it dwell in
[1:14:44] you then he that raised up Christ from
[1:14:47] the dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:14:51] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:14:54] you now we have to recognize tonight
[1:14:56] that we're not Immortal in our flesh
[1:14:59] we're mortal bodies here tonight our
[1:15:01] soul has passed from Death unto life and
[1:15:03] our soul is Immortal but we still have a
[1:15:06] flesh body but the spirit of the Lord is
[1:15:08] still available to change the situations
[1:15:11] of that mortal body and one day it will
[1:15:13] come a final change and our body will
[1:15:16] match our soul if the spirit of him that
[1:15:18] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:15:21] you then he that raised up Christ from
[1:15:23] the dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:15:25] bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in
[1:15:28] you amen we ask the Lord this evening to
[1:15:30] add the blessing into the reading of his
[1:15:31] word as you can have your seat here
[1:15:33] tonight amen for just a few moments if I
[1:15:35] could amen if I would take a a title
[1:15:38] tonight I want to speak to you here on
[1:15:40] this thought of we must not lose our
[1:15:43] enthusiasm we must not lose our
[1:15:46] enthusiasm and you know I want to begin
[1:15:48] tonight by saying that I believe that
[1:15:50] the enthusiasm of an age amen is the
[1:15:53] message of the hour
[1:15:55] amen that God sends into that age I
[1:15:57] don't believe amen that it's a it's a
[1:15:59] church or it's a song or it's a certain
[1:16:01] preacher amen but I believe the message
[1:16:04] of the hour amen is the enthusiasm among
[1:16:07] the church now in 1965 brother BR
[1:16:10] preaches two very powerful sermons and
[1:16:12] he preaches these both on the subject of
[1:16:14] quickening power he preaches one called
[1:16:17] the Easter seal and then he preaches
[1:16:19] another one and he calls it it is the
[1:16:20] rising of the sun now to draw our
[1:16:23] thought tonight I want to read here from
[1:16:24] the the Easter Shield paragraph 47 he
[1:16:27] said now as Christians we all claim that
[1:16:29] he is alive how many how many can claim
[1:16:31] that he's alive tonight we all claim
[1:16:33] that he is alive and we believe amen
[1:16:36] that we have been quickened from Death
[1:16:38] To Life by his Spirit now if we haven't
[1:16:41] been quickened then we've not been made
[1:16:42] alive now he says we're going to speak
[1:16:44] into this or subject for a minute he
[1:16:46] said how that are we quickened and can
[1:16:48] we be sure amen that this is the truth
[1:16:51] you know I believe the time has come
[1:16:54] Amen to move be on hoping that we're
[1:16:55] believing the right thing or guessing
[1:16:58] amen that we're believing the right
[1:16:59] thing but I believe it's time to come to
[1:17:01] a 100% confidence and Assurance amen
[1:17:04] that we know in whom we have believed we
[1:17:06] know who we're believing we know what
[1:17:08] we're following amen but we also know
[1:17:11] where we're going he said see this is
[1:17:13] your own life this is my life and if
[1:17:15] this isn't the truth amen what I'm
[1:17:17] fixing to say that I'm one of the most
[1:17:19] foolish people in the world he said I've
[1:17:21] give my life for something that there's
[1:17:23] nothing to and so have you but if it is
[1:17:26] the truth then I owe everything that I
[1:17:28] am see amen if this message is the truth
[1:17:32] then we owe everything that we are unto
[1:17:34] it see amen I owe everything that I
[1:17:36] could be to the cause of which we're
[1:17:38] standing for now listen to these words
[1:17:40] and I think amen that we must not lose
[1:17:43] our
[1:17:45] enthusiasm now that's a direct quote
[1:17:47] from the prophet amen I think that we
[1:17:49] must not amen lose our enthusiasm I want
[1:17:53] to begin by saying thank God
[1:17:55] amen for a Vindicated Prophet that
[1:17:57] preached amen a balance on enthusiasm he
[1:18:01] said now I'd rather have a little
[1:18:02] enthusiasm amen then no ASM at all see
[1:18:06] amen just to have somebody get enthused
[1:18:08] about it brother Ram would go on and
[1:18:10] make an announcement in 1958 he said the
[1:18:13] church today has lost its enthusiasm why
[1:18:16] because it's got out of the vine see
[1:18:19] it's no more being energized by the
[1:18:21] spirit Wells of water bubbling up into
[1:18:23] everlasting life they've lost that Zeal
[1:18:26] amen something is missing now watch amen
[1:18:29] God Remains the Same and Christ Remains
[1:18:32] the Same amen but his church has
[1:18:34] disassociated itself amen with his
[1:18:37] connection which is the vine the spirit
[1:18:40] so there the prophet of God identifies
[1:18:42] amen that the holy spirit is the source
[1:18:45] amen of the Zeal or the passion amen or
[1:18:48] the energy that is coming into the
[1:18:50] church amen which is causing an
[1:18:52] enthusiasm in the church he said let see
[1:18:55] have you noticed today's crop have you
[1:18:57] noticed today what we do anden we got
[1:18:59] enough God about us to we we'll come up
[1:19:01] to the platform and say well yes maybe I
[1:19:03] better come up now this is the
[1:19:05] experience of worldwide he said yes I
[1:19:07] better go up and stand and say well well
[1:19:09] I don't know here I am see huh amen what
[1:19:12] a place to be in he said there's no fire
[1:19:15] burning there's no enthusiasm now listen
[1:19:17] amen there's not a go into it amen
[1:19:20] there's not a go into it and as an
[1:19:22] evangelist he said that just k KS me to
[1:19:25] see God's people in that shape amen we
[1:19:27] are supposed to be on fire you all know
[1:19:30] the prophet of God had a vision amen of
[1:19:33] a map of Palestine and he was standing
[1:19:35] Amen on the map of Palestine and he was
[1:19:38] 2third of the way there and he's looking
[1:19:40] across the Jordan and he says over there
[1:19:43] amen is where all the promises were
[1:19:45] laying amen now now you know that that
[1:19:48] was two pools right amen of the third
[1:19:50] pool Ministry but the promises were not
[1:19:52] in the first pool the promises were not
[1:19:55] in the second pull amen but the promises
[1:19:57] were in the third pull amen so in order
[1:20:00] to go into that there had to be a let's
[1:20:02] go into it amen and I want to say
[1:20:04] tonight young people amen we are well
[1:20:07] established in the fact amen that God
[1:20:10] has sent a prophet amen we are well
[1:20:12] established in the fact that he was a
[1:20:13] Vindicated Prophet amen now let's say
[1:20:16] let me just say this amen it's time to
[1:20:18] go into amen what a prophet is taught in
[1:20:21] the age we're living in we're not just
[1:20:23] coming up to the board
[1:20:25] and saying there's healing in the land
[1:20:26] there's miracles in the land there's
[1:20:28] Deliverance in the land there's Revival
[1:20:30] in the land amen but there is a
[1:20:32] generation that is sitting before me
[1:20:34] tonight who is Anointed with the same
[1:20:37] Pillar of Fire Amen to rise amen and to
[1:20:40] move into every Divine promise that God
[1:20:42] has made Amen in this generation I think
[1:20:45] it's time to move amen into the
[1:20:48] revelation of the message of the hour I
[1:20:50] know it's getting to where people are
[1:20:51] getting a little bit scared Amen to
[1:20:53] preach what a prophet said said amen but
[1:20:55] I don't believe I'm looking at scare
[1:20:57] cats amen I believe I'm looking at
[1:20:59] Eagles amen I believe I'm looking at
[1:21:01] young people amen that's not afraid of
[1:21:03] this message you're not afraid of what a
[1:21:05] prophet taught you're not ashamed of the
[1:21:07] pictures you're not ashamed of the
[1:21:09] quotes amen there is a reality in your
[1:21:12] soul amen that this is more than a
[1:21:14] religion this is more than a church camp
[1:21:17] this is more than just an experience
[1:21:18] once a year amen but this is a bride's
[1:21:21] Revival and there is a fire that is
[1:21:23] burning and the hearts of the Believers
[1:21:26] amen there is an enthusiasm with this
[1:21:28] message now I love what the prophet of
[1:21:30] God said he said people misunderstand
[1:21:33] enthusiasm they say well amen they they
[1:21:36] misunderstand it see he said they
[1:21:38] misunderstand the power of the Holy
[1:21:40] Spirit they call it amen a bunch of Holy
[1:21:43] Rollers they call it a bunch of people
[1:21:45] that ain't got their right mind he said
[1:21:47] see they
[1:21:48] misunderstand that you had to lose what
[1:21:50] you call your right mind and you have to
[1:21:53] have the mind of Christ in you you
[1:21:55] cannot have the mind of the world Amen
[1:21:58] and the mind of Christ at the same time
[1:22:00] amen one is carnal amen and the other
[1:22:03] one is spiritual see he that walks after
[1:22:06] the flesh is carnal but he that walks
[1:22:08] after the spirit is spiritual he said so
[1:22:11] I'll lose myself amen and find it Lord
[1:22:14] in thee yes sir so God is misunderstood
[1:22:17] now let me just say this to you he says
[1:22:20] it's not you that's misunderstood amen
[1:22:22] it's the Holy Spirit making you do amen
[1:22:25] that they misunderstand amen so they're
[1:22:28] not misunderstanding you amen but
[1:22:30] they're misunderstanding the Holy Spirit
[1:22:33] on the inside of you that's making you
[1:22:35] do amen what you're doing see they're
[1:22:37] not speaking against you they are
[1:22:40] speaking against him let me say Amen it
[1:22:43] is not a man amen that makes me say what
[1:22:45] a prophet said it is not a man that
[1:22:48] makes you a man what a prophet said it's
[1:22:50] not a man that makes you young ladies
[1:22:52] dress the way you dress it's it's not a
[1:22:54] man that makes you young boys amen
[1:22:57] conduct yourselves the way you conduct
[1:22:59] yourself amen but if the same spirit
[1:23:02] that raised up Jesus from the dead if it
[1:23:04] dwell in your mortal bodies it will
[1:23:06] Quicken you and you'll begin to think
[1:23:08] like the word you'll begin to dress like
[1:23:11] the word you'll begin to talk like the
[1:23:12] word and worship like the word see
[1:23:16] because you are a word born bride see
[1:23:19] it's not you doing these things amen but
[1:23:22] it's the Holy Spirit that's on the
[1:23:24] inside of you amen that's making you do
[1:23:26] these things now amen just to just to
[1:23:28] lay a foundation here when you read this
[1:23:30] word amen enthusiasm it is a strong
[1:23:33] excitement amen of feeling now I'm
[1:23:35] pulling this definition amen of
[1:23:37] enthusiasm from a from a public
[1:23:39] dictionary amen it is a strong
[1:23:41] excitement of feeling it is something
[1:23:44] inspiring it is a Zeal it is a fervor
[1:23:47] now listen at this young people it is a
[1:23:49] belief in special Revelations of the
[1:23:52] holy spirit amen in enthusiasm is a
[1:23:55] belief Amen in special Revelations of
[1:23:59] the Holy Spirit do you realize in John
[1:24:01] chapter 1 when Jesus amen begin to call
[1:24:04] his disciples amen he chose Phillip by
[1:24:07] name and the prophet said after philli
[1:24:09] got converted amen he was all enthused
[1:24:12] amen and any man when he finds Jesus and
[1:24:15] gets saved amen there is an enthusiasm
[1:24:19] amen any man that finds Jesus and gets
[1:24:21] saved amen there is an enthusiasm he
[1:24:24] said you've got to be born again and
[1:24:26] when you're born amen then there's an
[1:24:29] enthusiasm amen that rises with that
[1:24:32] birth and it sets the solar fire and it
[1:24:35] takes all the differences away and the
[1:24:36] isms and comes straight to Calvary and
[1:24:39] recognizes Christ amen with the Burning
[1:24:42] Love and Zeal amen for the lost and
[1:24:44] Fallen World another place he says when
[1:24:47] he comes amen he will come in the
[1:24:49] fullness of his power he will come
[1:24:51] exactly amen the way he came on the day
[1:24:54] of Pentecost listen church if he comes
[1:24:56] and I believe he's already here into
[1:24:59] this building tonight he will not come
[1:25:01] amen any other way but the way he came
[1:25:04] on the day of Pentecost and you know how
[1:25:06] he come on the day of Pentecost he came
[1:25:08] in power he came in reality he came in
[1:25:11] transforming power he came in anointing
[1:25:14] he came in Supreme anointing well I say
[1:25:16] to you tonight amen devil get out of our
[1:25:18] way amen we've not shook a preacher's
[1:25:21] hand we've not put our name on a church
[1:25:23] roll but we been on the back side of the
[1:25:25] desert we've stood on Holy Ground we've
[1:25:28] stood on sacred Sands and we' met the
[1:25:30] god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the
[1:25:33] god of Jacob and we've been born again
[1:25:36] well you wonder why I shout it's because
[1:25:38] I've been born again you wonder why I
[1:25:41] dance it's because I've been born again
[1:25:43] you wonder why I can't stay in my seat
[1:25:46] when a man of God preaches the message
[1:25:48] it's because I've been born again
[1:25:50] there's an enthusiasm in my soul that
[1:25:53] responds to the word when I hear
[1:25:56] it and enthusiasm will burst out of your
[1:25:59] heart it'll make you so happy and so
[1:26:02] full of joy amen do you'll stagger like
[1:26:04] you were full of strong drink amen the
[1:26:06] pro of God said because the Bible said
[1:26:08] amen be not drunk upon strong drink amen
[1:26:11] which biteth like an Adder amen and
[1:26:13] stingeth like a serpent but be ye drunk
[1:26:16] on the spirit be ye drunk on the spirit
[1:26:20] now when I read that part of the
[1:26:21] definition amen a belief in Revelations
[1:26:25] of the holy spirit amen I just had to
[1:26:27] know Amen brother Wayne how could that
[1:26:30] be in a public definition of the word
[1:26:33] enthusiasm a special belief of
[1:26:36] Revelation from the holy spirit so I
[1:26:38] went back and looked up the word
[1:26:40] enthusiasm and let me just read you a
[1:26:41] little bit of history on it it may come
[1:26:43] as a surprise to many people when they
[1:26:46] first Look up the word enthusiasm Amen
[1:26:49] to see that its original meaning has to
[1:26:51] do amen with passion for religion
[1:26:54] religion amen rather than passionate or
[1:26:56] eager interest in general it is a brief
[1:26:59] explanation amen of the word emology
[1:27:01] should clear this up enthusiasm entered
[1:27:04] the English language around the
[1:27:06] beginning of the 17th century it was
[1:27:08] borrowed from the Greek amen enthus
[1:27:11] meaning inspiration or possession by God
[1:27:15] Amen so when the Greeks released this
[1:27:17] word it had a connection to inspiration
[1:27:21] amen and by that inspiration the God
[1:27:23] Amen that was inspiring you would take
[1:27:26] possession of you so they connected
[1:27:28] enthusiasm Amen to more than just
[1:27:31] excitement amen but they connected it to
[1:27:33] reality amen that you have been claimed
[1:27:36] by the almighty God see for the first
[1:27:39] 200 or so years it was used in English
[1:27:41] enthusiasm was primarily employed Amen
[1:27:45] to refer to beliefs or passions that
[1:27:47] related to religion but by the beginning
[1:27:50] of the 18th century however the word
[1:27:52] begin to describe having strong feelings
[1:27:55] amen or interest in interest in secular
[1:27:57] matters now what's amazing to me amen is
[1:28:00] that in one century amen the world
[1:28:03] changed what the word enthusiasm meant
[1:28:06] amen now you all know that what happens
[1:28:08] in the natural amen also happens in the
[1:28:11] spiritual and a prophet comes on the
[1:28:13] scene in 1962 and says now the sincerity
[1:28:16] amen the church has lost its enthusiasm
[1:28:19] and it's lost its
[1:28:22] sincerity he said we don't have it it
[1:28:24] seems to be such a small interest it
[1:28:27] should be in a time of this Jubilee
[1:28:29] right now after we know and they're
[1:28:30] positive these things it should be that
[1:28:32] Street Port would be buzzing like a buzz
[1:28:35] all amen the jail ought to be full
[1:28:37] hanging out the windows preaching the
[1:28:39] gospel amen the street quarters corns
[1:28:41] ought to be full of men and women
[1:28:43] testifying to the power of God yet we
[1:28:45] believe it and we say Amen but we've
[1:28:48] lost the sincerity amen and the
[1:28:50] enthusiasm is to receive it now that's
[1:28:53] the truth see and we'll never come back
[1:28:56] until we come down to that spot of
[1:28:58] appreciation of God Amen for making a
[1:29:00] way for us now watch this making a way
[1:29:03] for us and then calling us in it and
[1:29:06] vindicating it to us by his spirit and
[1:29:08] by his word amen that's the assurance
[1:29:11] that we have listen God did not just
[1:29:14] make a way amen but he called us into
[1:29:16] this way and the way that we're in he
[1:29:18] has Vindicated that way now watch and we
[1:29:21] have the answer to the devil's question
[1:29:24] let me say it as plain as I know how the
[1:29:26] message of the hour it must be received
[1:29:29] with sincerity and it must be received
[1:29:31] with some enthusiasm the prophet of God
[1:29:34] said what a tragedy Amen to see our
[1:29:36] churches in this condition I'll just
[1:29:38] have to stop and say thank God Amen for
[1:29:40] sending the message of the hour amen
[1:29:43] that restored the element of sincerity
[1:29:45] back amen listen we didn't even know how
[1:29:48] to come into church amen some would come
[1:29:50] in talking some would come in chewing
[1:29:52] gum some would come in hollering back
[1:29:54] and forth amen but God sent a prophet
[1:29:57] with a message called Church order and
[1:29:59] he begin to lay out how to create an
[1:30:01] atmosphere he wasn't doing that out of
[1:30:03] legalism he was doing that because he
[1:30:05] wanted the same spirit that raised Jesus
[1:30:08] from the dead Amen to come among the
[1:30:10] church and to change hearts and to save
[1:30:13] souls and to F and to seal with the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost listen I'm not ashamed amen of
[1:30:18] what a prophet has established in this
[1:30:20] generation I don't care who don't like
[1:30:22] it I don't care who don't enjoy it amen
[1:30:25] our Prophet never put music out of the
[1:30:26] church he never put joy out of the
[1:30:29] church but I might as well preach I feel
[1:30:31] good he never put shouting and dancing
[1:30:33] out of the church amen and listen he
[1:30:35] never put the Holy Ghost out
[1:30:37] either because don't forget it wasn't
[1:30:40] the holy ghost out of order it was the
[1:30:42] church out of order but when a prophet
[1:30:44] begin to lay the order the Holy Ghost
[1:30:46] begin to find a way Amen to move and to
[1:30:49] help people I say we welcome the Holy
[1:30:51] Ghost into this meeting tonight we
[1:30:54] welcome him to be the preacher we
[1:30:55] welcome him to be the speaker how many
[1:30:58] say I welcome him I welcome him to be my
[1:31:00] savior I welcome him to be my healer we
[1:31:03] welcome the message of the hour we don't
[1:31:06] want it watered down we don't want it
[1:31:08] diluted amen we want it with sincerity
[1:31:11] and
[1:31:13] enthusiasm yes sir amen he he even went
[1:31:16] as far to show us how to take communion
[1:31:18] he said communion ain't some little
[1:31:19] something you do he said no it's a it's
[1:31:22] an ordinance of God Amen he cleaned up
[1:31:24] the altars right amen he took the soda

[1:33:41] and it's come as sincerity and Truth now

[1:33:46] amen they make the gospel a funeral
[1:33:49] procession he said they go to church I
[1:33:52] give us a funeral procession and he said
[1:33:53] then others make it a Frolic see amen
[1:33:56] some of them just make it a Frolic just
[1:33:57] a big time to go and play a bunch of
[1:33:59] music and jump up and down on the
[1:34:00] platform Dance all over the platform or
[1:34:02] down in the aisle run down sit down and
[1:34:04] talk about their neighbors that's right
[1:34:06] amen some of them thinks they ought to
[1:34:08] stand and say the doxology in Apostles
[1:34:10] Creed I wanted somebody to show me where
[1:34:13] that's written in the Bible he said but
[1:34:15] here's the thing of it they're so busy
[1:34:17] making those things up that they make at
[1:34:19] a funeral procession when you add to
[1:34:22] this message amen you make it a funeral
[1:34:24] procession and when you add to this
[1:34:26] message you make it a Frolic I say but
[1:34:29] come back to what a prophet said the
[1:34:31] Gospel of Jesus Christ is it's not a
[1:34:34] funeral procession and neither is it a
[1:34:36] Frolic amen it is a feast with Christ
[1:34:39] where Believers come and die you know
[1:34:42] what I say I say come on over here amen
[1:34:45] come on over here where the table is
[1:34:47] spread and the Feast of the Lord is
[1:34:50] going on listen there's good food on
[1:34:52] this table there there's healing on this
[1:34:54] table there's miracles on this table
[1:34:57] there's salvation on this table there's
[1:34:59] reality on this table come on over in
[1:35:01] the third pull come on over in the
[1:35:03] opening of the word come on over in the
[1:35:05] message of the hour and feast till you

[1:35:09] devil back to hell where he come from
[1:35:12] yes sir this message is not a Frolic
[1:35:14] neither is it a funeral procession it is
[1:35:16] a feast I'll say to you tonight I
[1:35:18] believe there are some things amen that
[1:35:20] we as a church can afford to lose I
[1:35:23] believe we can afford to lose the cold
[1:35:25] the complacent and the critical Spirits
[1:35:27] I believe we can afford to lose the
[1:35:29] formal Spirits amen the fussing spirits
[1:35:32] and the fighting Spirits I believe we
[1:35:34] can afford to lose the doubtful Spirits
[1:35:36] amen the dull spirits and the dead
[1:35:38] spirits but there is one thing that we
[1:35:40] cannot afford to lose and that is our
[1:35:43] sincerity and our enthusiasm about what
[1:35:46] God has sent in this
[1:35:50] generation we can't afford to lose it
[1:35:53] because the prophet of God said it like
[1:35:54] this in both sermons he would preach
[1:35:56] Easter seal rising of the sun he would
[1:35:58] take his text Romans 8:11 he would say
[1:36:01] these words if the spirit of him that
[1:36:03] raised up Jesus from the dead amen if it
[1:36:06] dwell in you that he that raised up
[1:36:08] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:36:10] somebody shout Quicken shall also
[1:36:13] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:36:16] amen that dwelleth in you look at this
[1:36:18] word Quicken it means to be Gat or to
[1:36:21] Bear living young it is to restore to
[1:36:23] life it is to give the increase of life
[1:36:26] it is of the spirit quickening amen as
[1:36:28] respects the spirit it is endued with
[1:36:31] new and greater powers of life now I
[1:36:34] love this definition brother Josh amen
[1:36:36] was speaking about this last night in
[1:36:37] closing amen metaphorically of seeds
[1:36:40] amen that are quickened into life and
[1:36:43] they germinate and they spring up and
[1:36:45] they grow so quickening power don't just
[1:36:48] excite you and get you a start and it
[1:36:51] don't just take you halfway amen but it
[1:36:53] takes you from the germinating into the
[1:36:56] springing up into the growth listen all
[1:36:59] the way into maturity well I might as
[1:37:01] well say what a prophet said he said we
[1:37:03] did not become seed amen by the rebirth
[1:37:07] we were seed and therefore were able to
[1:37:10] be reborn because only the elect can be
[1:37:14] reborn listen friends because we were
[1:37:17] seed is the reason we could be quickened
[1:37:20] in nonseed there is nothing to quick
[1:37:24] hey devil hear me and hear me well
[1:37:26] you've done everything you can to bury
[1:37:28] this young people you've done everything
[1:37:30] you can to bury this bride but the devil
[1:37:32] forgot you had a seed I said the devil
[1:37:35] forgot there was a seed on the inside of
[1:37:38] your soul and it don't matter what you
[1:37:40] lay that seed under if there's life in
[1:37:43] that seed when the sun begins to rise
[1:37:46] it's going to pull it listen can I say
[1:37:48] this to you amen some of you all begin
[1:37:50] under mud you begin under mck you under
[1:37:53] M you was like the Pond Lily you was
[1:37:56] buried underneath all these complexes
[1:37:58] and all these pressures and all these
[1:38:00] situations and and generational curses
[1:38:02] and all these things amen but in the
[1:38:05] evening time there shall be a duel
[1:38:07] sunrising it will not just be the Su n
[1:38:10] it will be the s o n and it will be
[1:38:13] rising to do one thing Amen to bring
[1:38:15] life to God's promised seed that by for
[1:38:19] knowledge he said would be laid upon the
[1:38:22] Earth so he come to redeem or to bring
[1:38:25] to life those predestinated seed that
[1:38:29] God seen before the foundation of the
[1:38:33] world and put their names in The Book of
[1:38:36] Life and here they are on the earth
[1:38:38] without a hope but he come not only to
[1:38:40] be the blessing but to share the
[1:38:44] blessing he didn't come just to be the
[1:38:46] blessing he come to share the blessing
[1:38:49] with every predestinated seed amen let's
[1:38:52] just goe with that devil how many can
[1:38:55] raise your hand and from the depths of
[1:38:56] your soul say I believe there is a
[1:38:59] predestinated genan seed of almighty God
[1:39:02] in the depths of my soul I believe there
[1:39:05] is a seat there I don't believe there's
[1:39:07] one coming I believe it's already there
[1:39:10] then can I say what the prophet said he
[1:39:12] said you belong to God before the
[1:39:15] foundation of the world and if you ever
[1:39:17] was a part of God if you ever belong to
[1:39:20] God you always will belong to God listen
[1:39:23] Young people somewhere sometime you got
[1:39:25] to whip that devil and quit riding an
[1:39:27] emotional roller coaster of one day I'm
[1:39:30] a son and the next day I'm a serpent
[1:39:32] seed if the Revelation ever strikes your
[1:39:35] soul that I am a seed Gene of God on my
[1:39:38] good days I'm a Child of God on my bad
[1:39:41] days I'm a Child of God when I'm on the
[1:39:43] mountain I'm a Child of God when I'm in
[1:39:45] the Valley I'm a Child of God it don't
[1:39:47] matter where you put a child of God
[1:39:49] there'll still be a child of God you can
[1:39:52] put him in oh high you can put him in
[1:39:54] Virginia you can put him in Louisiana
[1:39:56] but because they're connected to the
[1:39:58] vine and they've not disassociated their
[1:40:01] s with the quickening power there is a
[1:40:04] witness of who you
[1:40:06] are somebody go ahead and tell that
[1:40:07] devil I don't belong to you I belong to
[1:40:11] God now if that spirit that raised up
[1:40:14] Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you
[1:40:16] look at this word dwelleth it means to
[1:40:18] dwell in one and to influence him for
[1:40:21] the good
[1:40:24] to dwell in one and influence him for
[1:40:27] the good now do you realize why you got
[1:40:29] to put the leaven out you know why
[1:40:32] because leav has the ability to
[1:40:34] influence for the good or the bad so you
[1:40:38] can have le and brother it can influence
[1:40:41] good a while and then brother Austin it
[1:40:43] can influence bad a while but if you
[1:40:45] ever put the leaven out and replace it
[1:40:48] with quickening power the only thing
[1:40:51] you're being influenced is by something
[1:40:53] that's good can I say this what is the
[1:40:56] quickening power it is God Amen dwelling
[1:40:59] in the soul of The Believer by the power
[1:41:02] of the Holy Ghost amen quickening you to
[1:41:04] manifest every promise of the word for
[1:41:07] the age you're living in I want to tell
[1:41:09] the devil we are under the influence but
[1:41:11] it's not of wine it's not of liquor it's
[1:41:14] not of alcohol we are under the
[1:41:16] influence of quickening power and that
[1:41:19] quickening power has the ability Amen to
[1:41:22] change any situ ation that we're going
[1:41:24] through listen I'm just going to go
[1:41:25] ahead and say it amen devils are going
[1:41:27] to lose their whole
[1:41:29] tonight amen situations are going to
[1:41:31] lose tonight amen because we're not
[1:41:33] preaching this message with some
[1:41:35] psychology and some education and a
[1:41:38] better approach we are preaching pure
[1:41:40] message so if you are a seed the only
[1:41:43] thing you can receive is the quickening
[1:41:45] power and that quickening power will
[1:41:47] transform you into what God called you
[1:41:50] to be but said we know what it done for
[1:41:52] Jesus but I I want you to see amen not
[1:41:54] what it will do but what it has done the
[1:41:57] same for you what does it do it quickens
[1:42:00] the Mortal body see this Mortal body
[1:42:03] that we live in it quickens it in other
[1:42:06] words it brings it to life brother
[1:42:08] sister the quickening power brings this
[1:42:11] body to life now you once walked with a
[1:42:13] long great big cigar in your mouth and a
[1:42:15] bunch of cigarettes and you women once
[1:42:17] had short hair and painted and carried
[1:42:19] on and wore shorts things like that amen
[1:42:21] but something screamed and you look down
[1:42:24] here and it was the word see it
[1:42:26] quickened and you said now come on cuz
[1:42:29] we get so caught up and how we going to
[1:42:31] get the the earrings off and the makeup
[1:42:33] off and the high heel shoes off how we
[1:42:36] going to get heyen we start trying to
[1:42:37] get a little legalistic amen and trying
[1:42:39] to do with ourselves amen but I tell you
[1:42:41] what a prophet said he said quickening
[1:42:44] power will strike F seed and he said
[1:42:46] here's what it'll say no more shorts for
[1:42:49] me no more liquor for me no more lime
[1:42:53] for me no more steal and no more this
[1:42:55] that see the spirit that raised him from
[1:42:58] the dead dwelling in you will also bring
[1:43:01] your mortal bodies amen the dust of the
[1:43:03] earth into subjection you see what is it
[1:43:07] subjection to what amen Christ and who
[1:43:10] is Christ he is the word so quickening
[1:43:13] power is bringing your mortal body into
[1:43:16] subjection to the word against its own
[1:43:18] will oh God do you see right now amen
[1:43:22] right now it's not your soul that don't
[1:43:24] want you to go to church it's not your
[1:43:26] soul that don't want you to raise your
[1:43:27] hands it's not your soul that don't want
[1:43:29] to hear this message it's not your soul
[1:43:32] that says the preacher's too long and
[1:43:33] the sound system's too loud and the
[1:43:35] service was too long that's not your
[1:43:37] soul amen that's just oh sorry stinking
[1:43:40] rotten flesh but if the spirit that
[1:43:43] raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell
[1:43:46] in that Soul it will bring this body
[1:43:49] under subjection to the Holy Ghost let
[1:43:51] me say right now the devil don't wants
[1:43:53] you to get healed but he don't have a
[1:43:55] choice because greater is the quickening
[1:43:58] power in your soul than what the devil
[1:44:00] is Anointed your flesh with if God says
[1:44:03] you are healed you can stack every devil
[1:44:05] and hell up you will not defeat the
[1:44:07] healing power of Jesus
[1:44:11] Christ now there's a war goes on there's
[1:44:14] a war between your spirit and your flesh
[1:44:15] and your soul but a prophet of God said
[1:44:17] if the spirit raised Jesus from the dead
[1:44:19] dwells in you it will also Quicken your
[1:44:21] moral body it'll make you do things you
[1:44:24] didn't do before Oh My it'll make you do
[1:44:28] things you didn't do before see they was
[1:44:31] full of quickening power if that spirit
[1:44:34] that raised up Jesus from the dead it
[1:44:36] dwells in you it will Quicken or make a
[1:44:39] alive your mortal bodies because it's
[1:44:41] already life now listen what a prophet
[1:44:43] says and when it comes into your body it
[1:44:46] brings your whole body under subjection
[1:44:50] Amen to what to the word of God listen
[1:44:53] friends as the message of the hour has
[1:44:55] been revealed to us it has done more
[1:44:58] than just touch our feet to dance it has
[1:45:00] done more than just touch our lips to
[1:45:02] speak in tongues it has done more than
[1:45:05] just touched our hands to raise but this
[1:45:07] quickening power has taking control of
[1:45:09] our feet it's taken control of our hands
[1:45:12] it's taken control of our eyes it's
[1:45:14] taking control of our lips listen
[1:45:16] friends we are not church members we are
[1:45:18] walking Messiah who are reflecting his
[1:45:21] dominion and power in every Dimension
[1:45:24] that we live
[1:45:26] in it does not just affect one part it
[1:45:28] affects the whole body see what does it
[1:45:30] do to our mortal bodies I'm going
[1:45:32] somewhere it turns your opinion it
[1:45:35] changes our Notions it sets our
[1:45:37] affection on things which are above see
[1:45:41] the smoking the drinking the gambling
[1:45:43] all those things you used to do amen
[1:45:45] they are dead it's beneath
[1:45:48] you oh God so what this quickening power
[1:45:51] does it takes task Masters that used to
[1:45:54] be above you and it puts them underneath
[1:45:57] you see this quickening power come on
[1:46:01] this quickening power also brings your
[1:46:03] body into a raptured condition
[1:46:07] already glory to God so you're not
[1:46:10] waiting for the morning the Rapture to
[1:46:12] get Rapture Ready but if the same spirit
[1:46:15] that raised Jesus from the dead if it
[1:46:17] dwell in you it'll bring your body
[1:46:20] subject to the message of the hour it'll
[1:46:23] take you beyond 45 it'll take you beyond
[1:46:25] 55 it'll take you beyond 61 it'll take
[1:46:28] you all the way to 63 where a prophet
[1:46:31] said rapturing faith is laying on those
[1:46:35] tapes and as you feed on that word it
[1:46:38] will bring your body in condition for
[1:46:41] Rapture see God by his Spirit dwelling
[1:46:44] in The Believer as a manifestation of
[1:46:47] the word is a scriptural promise in 2
[1:46:50] Corinthians 6 as God has said I will
[1:46:53] dwell in them and I will walk in them
[1:46:55] and I will be their God and they shall
[1:46:59] be my people another place he says let
[1:47:02] the word of Christ amen let it dwell in
[1:47:04] you richly another place he says the
[1:47:06] good thing which was committed to thee
[1:47:08] amen keep by the Holy Ghost which
[1:47:11] dwelleth in us he says it's very
[1:47:13] beautiful he said Lord Jesus we're
[1:47:14] certainly a blessed people above our
[1:47:16] thinking above our understanding if
[1:47:19] there was an Noble one among us such as
[1:47:20] some Personnel from some country amen
[1:47:23] but today we have the god of Heaven not
[1:47:26] only among us but he is in us and he's
[1:47:29] dwelling living his life through us it's
[1:47:32] beyond our understanding listen it's a
[1:47:36] mystery to the devil how that God got
[1:47:38] into you it's a mystery to the devil how
[1:47:41] that God could take a sinner that was
[1:47:43] born in sin shap in iniquity come in the
[1:47:46] world speaking lies with all the marks
[1:47:48] against you but by quickening power and
[1:47:51] a seed in your soul he could reach down
[1:47:53] and pick you up and transform
[1:47:57] you yes sir what are you saying I'm
[1:48:00] saying the spirit of God is Not Just on
[1:48:02] us but the spirit of God is in us now
[1:48:05] there's one way of interpreting
[1:48:06] enthusiasm it is like this the spirit of
[1:48:09] God within job says that there is a
[1:48:12] spirit in man right and the inspiration
[1:48:15] of the almighty giveth him understanding
[1:48:17] look at this word Spirit it is the
[1:48:19] spirit of Heaven amen as impaling Pro
[1:48:22] profit to utter instruction or warning
[1:48:26] it is imparting a war like energy
[1:48:29] executive and administrative power so
[1:48:32] when a prophet comes he doesn't come to
[1:48:34] play games he doesn't come to have a
[1:48:36] picnic but he comes possessed by God
[1:48:39] with a warlike energy with an executive
[1:48:43] Authority with an administrative
[1:48:45] Authority upon his life and he begins to
[1:48:47] say things and what he says are not
[1:48:49] ideas they're not suggestions they're
[1:48:51] not opinions amen they are instructions
[1:48:55] amen they are warnings and they are
[1:48:57] separating you from the confusion of the
[1:48:59] age you're living in that's why Jesus
[1:49:01] said when he the spirit of Truth has
[1:49:03] come he will guide you into all truth
[1:49:06] now listen what the prophet says he says
[1:49:08] I want you to notice amen the symbols of
[1:49:10] Christ in the Bible and here on Earth he
[1:49:13] said now on Earth he was a prophet and
[1:49:15] he said a prophet is the word so the
[1:49:18] word Prophet means a Divine interpreter
[1:49:21] of the word so the Divine word is wrote
[1:49:24] and the prophet has the Divine spirit of
[1:49:27] God within him and you know the prophet
[1:49:29] in the Old Testament was called God he
[1:49:32] said now see because he was called God
[1:49:34] was because he packed within him the
[1:49:38] word of God which was thus saith the
[1:49:41] Lord therefore now listen to me
[1:49:44] therefore the word Prophet means his
[1:49:47] interpretation isn't to be mingled with
[1:49:53] a prophet's interpretation is not to be
[1:49:56] mingled with now let's just go ahead and
[1:49:58] preach since we're here amen somebody
[1:49:59] say well I don't think it matters if a
[1:50:01] boy wears shorts well that's your
[1:50:03] interpretation but a prophet brought
[1:50:05] interpretation upon on that and he said
[1:50:07] shun the evil
[1:50:11] things so what we start doing is we
[1:50:13] start mingling interpretations and
[1:50:15] before long we got the message believing
[1:50:17] this and meaning that amen but let's
[1:50:19] just say what a prophet said he said it
[1:50:21] means thus sayth the Lord yes sir and
[1:50:25] then you see the Divine interpretation
[1:50:27] of the word it has to coincide with this
[1:50:30] last Revelation to the church so you're
[1:50:32] not just a generation amen receiving a
[1:50:35] feeling or receiving a sensation you are
[1:50:38] a generation that God has claimed Amen
[1:50:41] to live in You by the word but also to
[1:50:44] walk in you I'm going somewhere the
[1:50:48] Bible says in third John 1 it says for I
[1:50:50] Rejoice greatly and when the Brethren
[1:50:52] came and testified of the truth that is
[1:50:55] in thee even as thou walkest in the
[1:50:57] truth now listen what he says I have no
[1:51:00] Greater Joy than to know that my
[1:51:03] children they walk in truth God Has No
[1:51:07] Greater Joy than to know you are not
[1:51:11] walking in mingled interpretation you're
[1:51:13] not walking in imaginary interpretation
[1:51:16] you're not walking in private
[1:51:17] interpretation but the joy over God's
[1:51:20] life is there is a teenager in the
[1:51:22] middle of Satan's Eden where Lucifer has
[1:51:25] become the god of this evil age but they
[1:51:27] have a seed on the inside of their soul
[1:51:30] and the only thing they can follow is
[1:51:33] the Vindicated word of the hour in the
[1:51:35] age they're living in listen I can't
[1:51:37] follow anything else but this message
[1:51:39] amen my seed won't let me my seed won't
[1:51:42] let me follow mingled interpretation my
[1:51:45] seed won't let me follow feelings and
[1:51:47] Sensations my seed will only allow me to
[1:51:50] follow thus sayith the Lord through the
[1:51:53] Vindicated message of the
[1:51:55] hour you want something to shout about
[1:51:57] that's something to shout about you want
[1:51:59] something to dance about that's
[1:52:00] something to dance about when boys don't
[1:52:02] even know if they're boys and girls
[1:52:04] don't even know if they're girls but God
[1:52:06] through his sovereignty put a seed in
[1:52:08] your soul that in an age of such
[1:52:10] confusion when men are becoming women
[1:52:12] and women are becoming men and kids are
[1:52:15] becoming cats that God gave you a s he
[1:52:18] gave you a vision he give you a message
[1:52:20] he gave you a pillar of fire he give you
[1:52:22] a clear
[1:52:25] Direction it's not a religion it's a
[1:52:28] special
[1:52:30] Revelation it's not a feeling it's the
[1:52:33] sayth the Lord Brother Ben it's not my
[1:52:36] idea it's his
[1:52:41] word talk about Joy I got joy I got joy
[1:52:46] cuz I know how to baptize I got joy cuz
[1:52:48] I know how to
[1:52:50] pray on
[1:52:53] you want something to shout about amen
[1:52:55] thank God that there's some men of God
[1:52:57] that know who they are in the word of
[1:52:59] God and when you come up for prayer
[1:53:01] tonight there ain't a bunch of sissies
[1:53:03] up here with a pair of gloves on Amen
[1:53:05] trying to deal with Spirits that's
[1:53:07] trying to destroy you but there's men of
[1:53:09] God who the spirit of God dwells
[1:53:12] in and when they lay their hands upon
[1:53:15] you they don't say Mr devil would you
[1:53:17] please come out Mr devil would you
[1:53:19] please move on when they lay their hands
[1:53:21] upon you they say Satan in the name of
[1:53:23] the Lord Jesus Christ take your hands
[1:53:26] off of God's Property you know where
[1:53:28] that's coming from that's coming from an
[1:53:33] enthusiasm they've not gotten stale with
[1:53:36] the message of the hour I just tell you
[1:53:38] what a prophet said he said somehow or
[1:53:40] another I just feel we're going see
[1:53:42] there's something laying right ahead for
[1:53:44] us
[1:53:45] 1965 now just remember I believe I am
[1:53:49] prophesying that great Joys lay ahead
[1:53:53] woo brother brother Ray great Joys lay
[1:53:57] ahead so it didn't end in 65 but the
[1:54:01] prophet said great Joys are laying
[1:54:05] ahead he said great Joys are laying
[1:54:08] ahead believe it that's right many
[1:54:11] sadden Hearts he said will be see great
[1:54:14] Mysteries will be made clear and people
[1:54:17] who are sad will be turned into
[1:54:20] Joy oh God people who are sad will be
[1:54:24] turned in Joy when Mysteries become
[1:54:27] Revelations sadness is going to lose its
[1:54:30] effect when Mysteries become more than
[1:54:33] symbols sadness is going to lose its
[1:54:36] influence come on Copus you're walking
[1:54:38] on the road of the meus and you're
[1:54:40] saying it's sad our Lord has been
[1:54:42] crucified our Lord is in a tomb amen if
[1:54:45] he had have been here this would have
[1:54:46] happened but there they were sister Ella
[1:54:49] they were walking with the resurrection
[1:54:51] they were walking with the Lord but
[1:54:53] their eyes didn't come open amen their
[1:54:55] eyes didn't come open till they went in
[1:54:57] a little room and he took the
[1:55:00] bread brother Jesse luk he took the
[1:55:02] bread he broke it like he did before and
[1:55:05] he blessed it and when he broke the
[1:55:06] bread and blessed it their eyes come
[1:55:08] open and they knew he's not in a tomb
[1:55:12] he's right here in St Mary's OH high on
[1:55:15] a Saturday night in twt our God is Not
[1:55:19] Dead Brother Levi our God is alive he
[1:55:22] he's a well God he's a healing God he's
[1:55:25] a moving
[1:55:28] God Mysteries being revealed was
[1:55:31] prophesied to bring a great joy in the
[1:55:34] church and turn sadness into Joy oh
[1:55:39] somebody say well amen don't you preach
[1:55:41] on the Rapture brother we can't help but
[1:55:43] preach on the Rapture somebody said
[1:55:45] don't you preach on those Mysteries
[1:55:47] brother we can't help but preach on them
[1:55:49] because that's the only thing that
[1:55:51] brings us some Joy
[1:55:52] is God knowing that his children are
[1:55:55] walking in
[1:55:59] truth want me prove it to you amen go
[1:56:02] down here to a local church and get up
[1:56:04] and start preaching on the Rapture and
[1:56:05] every person there will stop shouting
[1:56:07] they'll stop rejoicing you know why
[1:56:09] because the Rapture to them is a heavy
[1:56:11] thing it's a scareful thing but you come
[1:56:14] to our meetings you come to some Eagle
[1:56:16] meetings you come on over here where
[1:56:19] it's not a funeral procession and it's
[1:56:21] not a frolic but it's a feast you come
[1:56:24] on over here where quickening power is
[1:56:26] dwelling in hearts and start saying
[1:56:28] there's a Rapture saying there's a body
[1:56:30] change saying there's a coming of the
[1:56:32] Lord and our meetings will go to another
[1:56:34] level because we are the Fulfillment of
[1:56:37] the prophet's prophecy when the
[1:56:39] Mysteries become revealed there will be
[1:56:41] great joy it'll be joy to shout in it'll
[1:56:44] be joy to dance in it'll be joy to
[1:56:47] preach
[1:56:48] in there will return an enthusiasm
[1:56:53] well I'm going to go ahead and say it
[1:56:55] you ain't taking my
[1:56:56] joy you can turn off the music but I
[1:56:59] still got joy you can turn off the
[1:57:02] keyboard but I still got joy you can
[1:57:04] turn off a microphone but I still got
[1:57:08] joy how do you have joy because I'm
[1:57:11] walking in truth and my Lord is
[1:57:14] supplying me
[1:57:18] joy now now the Bible says there will be
[1:57:21] a p room right
[1:57:23] would come among the church what he
[1:57:25] would do is he would eat away the
[1:57:28] joy off the tree now let me just say
[1:57:31] this there is a connection between
[1:57:34] eating and the fruit Palmer worb begins
[1:57:39] to eat the fruit of the joy off but the
[1:57:41] bride begins to
[1:57:45] eat and as she begins to eat Joy begins
[1:57:48] to return
[1:57:52] so the Palmer worm through mingled
[1:57:55] interpretations ate the tree
[1:58:00] down but the spirit of Truth through a
[1:58:03] prophet begins to place the word of
[1:58:06] restoration and begins to build the tree
[1:58:08] back up now he that ha an ear let him
[1:58:11] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:58:14] churches now watch this to him that
[1:58:19] overcometh so not him that stay
[1:58:21] underneath
[1:58:23] but him that
[1:58:24] over will I give to eat of the Hidden
[1:58:27] Mana said the hidden Mana it's a little
[1:58:30] something special what is it the Special
[1:58:32] the blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no
[1:58:35] that's for the whole congregation but
[1:58:37] the hidden Mana was a special Revelation
[1:58:40] because he had to teach the other SE was
[1:58:43] a little more knowledge of the scripture
[1:58:45] that he could teach others so that hid
[1:58:47] Mana was a type of the shoe bread which
[1:58:49] was reserved for the priest the propag
[1:58:51] God said was a special thing made for
[1:58:53] the priest see the leaders and this man
[1:58:55] overcome now the whole
[1:58:59] congregation got the Mana but he got a
[1:59:02] hidden special Mana or a special
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:07] revelation of Jesus and what was about
[1:59:10] him and all about him see he got it
[1:59:12] through the
[1:59:13] angel so the angel got the Mana and he
[1:59:17] brings it to the church now listen and
[1:59:20] when the church stopped eating eting the
[1:59:22] Mana enthusiasm move from possession of
[1:59:26] a god into some passion for sports so
[1:59:29] that's why people have to get up and say
[1:59:31] well this ain't enthusiasm amen I heard
[1:59:33] our brother Nathan last night have to
[1:59:35] stand here and say listen this ain't
[1:59:37] enthus this ain't enthused amen this is
[1:59:39] revelation this is now listen he had to
[1:59:42] say that because the devil took the word
[1:59:44] that originally belonged to the Church
[1:59:46] of enthusiasm and perverted it to a
[1:59:49] passion for sports to a passion for
[1:59:51] Hollywood to a Zeal for education and so
[1:59:54] now amen it's look like enthusiasm just
[1:59:57] come in the message well let me just say
[1:59:59] this amen we did not go to the
[2:00:01] Pentecostal church and take the shout
[2:00:03] from them they took it from
[2:00:06] us we did not go Amen to the Pentecostal
[2:00:09] church and take the dance from them they
[2:00:12] took it from us see because we were seed
[2:00:15] in the beginning and because we were
[2:00:18] seed is why we could be Quicken well if
[2:00:20] we can take our dance back back and if
[2:00:22] we can take our shout back then I think
[2:00:24] we got a right tonight Church to take
[2:00:27] back the true meaning of what an infused
[2:00:29] Holy Ghost filled fire baptized son and
[2:00:32] daughter of God is it ain't a bunch of
[2:00:34] shackles and Creeds it's liberty in his
[2:00:39] presence it's reality in his presence
[2:00:42] yes sir what is it it's the word listen
[2:00:44] we're not feeding on enthusiasm no sir
[2:00:47] I'm not serving you enthusiasm tonight
[2:00:49] but what I am serving you will cause
[2:00:51] some
[2:00:52] enthusiasm because according to
[2:00:54] scripture Jesus will come in three sons
[2:00:56] names he will come as the son of man the
[2:00:59] Son of God and the son of David but in
[2:01:02] between the Son of God and the son of
[2:01:04] David according to Luke 17:30 he will
[2:01:07] reveal
[2:01:08] himself as the son of man now watch this
[2:01:13] brother said even th shall it be in the
[2:01:14] day when when the son of man is revealed
[2:01:17] he said see the son of man is now being
[2:01:20] revealed from heaven heaven will it come
[2:01:23] after a while brother brandom it is now
[2:01:25] the son of man has already come from
[2:01:28] glory and is revealed himself for the
[2:01:31] past few years to his church and mercy
[2:01:33] and he's showing them his great presence
[2:01:35] doing the same things that he did when
[2:01:36] he was here on Earth revealing himself
[2:01:38] like he did to Abraham before the
[2:01:41] destruction what is it he reveals
[2:01:43] himself in Mercy saving your soul giving
[2:01:46] you of his life giving you Joy in the
[2:01:49] stad of sadness giving you faith in the
[2:01:51] stad of fear here healing in the stead
[2:01:53] of sickness revealing himself to you in
[2:01:55] his Mercy listen the very same way that
[2:01:58] he did back there what is the revealing
[2:02:01] of the son of man it is the
[2:02:04] word coming back in human flesh again
[2:02:08] see what kind of revelation will it be
[2:02:11] it will be a revelation of his living
[2:02:14] after being crucified 1900 years but is
[2:02:17] raised from the
[2:02:20] dead if is raised from the dead and is
[2:02:24] alive with us can I give the devil one
[2:02:26] more black eye in that day when the son
[2:02:29] of man has been revealed a son a man
[2:02:31] Jesus Christ made manifest among his
[2:02:35] people I have just identified to you
[2:02:37] where our shout comes from I have just
[2:02:39] identified to you where our dance comes
[2:02:42] from we thank God for the music and we
[2:02:44] thank God for the good songs but where
[2:02:46] our shout comes from and where our dance
[2:02:49] comes from is when those Mysteries begin
[2:02:51] to to be made clear and our eyes begin
[2:02:54] to focus on what a prophet said and we
[2:02:56] begin to turn from sadness into Joy come
[2:02:59] on some of you right now are sitting
[2:03:01] here and you're sick in your body but if
[2:03:03] you'll not focus on me or focus on any
[2:03:05] other preacher but if you will focus on
[2:03:08] the revealing of the son of man while
[2:03:10] you're hearing the word he will take
[2:03:12] away your sickness and he will give you
[2:03:14] healing he will take away your
[2:03:16] depression and he will give you Joy he
[2:03:18] will take away your condemnation and he
[2:03:21] will give you just J
[2:03:22] ification the son of man is in the
[2:03:25] building tonight and he's not held down
[2:03:27] with denominational shackles he's here
[2:03:29] in Liberty he's hearing power he's heing
[2:03:34] reality it ain't a man it's the son of
[2:03:37] man we're feeding on the unfailing body
[2:03:40] word the unfailing body word the
[2:03:44] unfailing body word of the son of man
[2:03:50] now where does our strength come from
[2:03:52] our strength comes from feeding
[2:03:56] fully not
[2:03:58] partially but fully on the revealing of
[2:04:02] the son of man brother Josh quoted this
[2:04:04] last night he says we do have today by
[2:04:07] God's help the perfect interpretation of
[2:04:10] the word with Divine
[2:04:14] Vindication 1965 but as it is in every
[2:04:18] age people let man put their own
[2:04:20] interpretation to it by
[2:04:24] Theology and will not believe God's
[2:04:27] Divine Vindication of it that's God's
[2:04:30] interpretation now do you realize in
[2:04:32] Malachi in Genesis 3 that there was a
[2:04:35] Messianic prophecy and if you study the
[2:04:37] Bible all the way through the Bible
[2:04:39] there is a a a a line of Messianic
[2:04:42] prophecies they started in Genesis 3 and
[2:04:46] they culminate when the word become
[2:04:48] flesh so in other words when Jesus
[2:04:51] became flesh the word among us they were
[2:04:53] no longer
[2:04:56] prophecies but they were now
[2:04:59] fulfilled in other words you no longer
[2:05:02] have to wonder what they
[2:05:05] are brother said the Bible described him
[2:05:08] he said but by the time he arrived on
[2:05:10] the scene the people to whom he was sent
[2:05:13] had their own interpretation of what he
[2:05:15] was to be their own imaginary
[2:05:20] interpretation now do you see what stops
[2:05:22] many of us is imaginary
[2:05:26] interpretation we begin to imagine the
[2:05:29] way God will do something we begin to
[2:05:31] imagine the way God will Deliver Us in
[2:05:33] his Spirit we will begin to imagine how
[2:05:36] God will give us the Holy Ghost listen
[2:05:38] we are not following imaginations We are
[2:05:41] following
[2:05:44] Revelation imagination has no Authority
[2:05:47] it is open for any power to come by and
[2:05:50] influence it but but this Revelation is
[2:05:53] only influenced by one person and that
[2:05:56] is by the one who sent it and that is
[2:05:58] the son of man and he's returned to the
[2:06:00] church in the form of the spirit of God
[2:06:03] which is quickening
[2:06:05] power now listen the Bible never changed
[2:06:09] the Bible is always the same that's the
[2:06:11] reason I say the Bible is of no private
[2:06:15] interpretation all right they lived
[2:06:17] right in the word now listen now I'm
[2:06:19] just going to can I take my Liberty
[2:06:21] brother Nathan
[2:06:23] a man could not be a teacher a priest
[2:06:26] until he was born in a certain lineage
[2:06:29] after Levi just think his great great
[2:06:32] great great great great great great
[2:06:33] great
[2:06:34] grandfather that's a lot of greats was a
[2:06:36] priest and he was laying right in that
[2:06:39] word in the temple day and night like
[2:06:40] the Catholic preacher or the minister
[2:06:42] that had handed down Minister from
[2:06:43] generation to the certain churches and
[2:06:45] so forth and they said see my great
[2:06:47] great great great great great
[2:06:48] grandfather was meist Bishop so my
[2:06:50] grandfather was a bishop and so forth
[2:06:52] see all right they lived right in the
[2:06:54] word but they had formed their own way
[2:06:57] of it and their children had accepted
[2:07:03] it their children had accepted it in
[2:07:06] such a way that the fathers had taught
[2:07:08] it until the fathers had taught it off
[2:07:10] of the real way and there had been such
[2:07:12] an organization out of it till when the
[2:07:14] spirit tried to present
[2:07:17] truth When the Spirit come in the
[2:07:20] meeting when the spirit Spirit come in
[2:07:22] twt and begin to present truth they
[2:07:25] could not receive
[2:07:26] it come on Church their great great
[2:07:29] great great great great great great
[2:07:30] grandfathers taught how the Messiah
[2:07:32] would come by imaginary interpretation
[2:07:35] so when he come walking in the flesh and
[2:07:37] he looked at him and said I am he they
[2:07:39] said that's not the way Granddaddy
[2:07:41] taught it that's not the way so and so
[2:07:43] taught it that's not the way the rabbi
[2:07:45] taught it listen it didn't stop at the
[2:07:47] elders it went into the Next Generation
[2:07:50] brother B said it's the same thing today
[2:07:52] he said they make it so complicated some
[2:07:54] of the way to teach it he said listen
[2:07:56] God don't have grandchildren God only
[2:07:59] has sons and Sons only follow the
[2:08:02] leadership of the holy spirit let me say
[2:08:05] this church I pray to God that they

[2:14:45] glorified what are you
[2:14:48] saying I'm saying take your stand
[2:14:52] on thus saith the
[2:14:54] Lord now can I share something with you
[2:14:58] here you didn't come out of the lineage
[2:15:00] of
[2:15:01] Ahab do you realize
[2:15:04] that you're not
[2:15:07] Ahab Ahab is not in your
[2:15:12] genealogy you didn't come from
[2:15:14] Ahab you came out of the same line that
[2:15:19] Elijah come out of now in the book of 2
[2:15:22] Kings 17:1 the Bible says Elisha the
[2:15:25] tishbite who was the inhabitants of
[2:15:27] Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of
[2:15:31] Israel liveth before whom I sit and
[2:15:34] wonder who I am
[2:15:37] and that know what it
[2:15:39] says let me read that again before whom
[2:15:43] I imagine that I am a Son of God
[2:15:46] and before whom I stand
[2:15:51] there shall not be duom nor rain these
[2:15:53] years but according to my word Elijah
[2:15:57] stands there as a human man but he
[2:16:00] stands there not upon imaginary
[2:16:03] interpretation but he stands there upon
[2:16:05] a revelation and says they'll not be due
[2:16:08] and they'll not be rain until I call for
[2:16:11] it listen what the prophet of God says
[2:16:13] just paraphrasing he says then God would
[2:16:15] send Elijah to cherith then that drought
[2:16:17] comes in then God would send him from
[2:16:19] cherith when that when that Brook dried
[2:16:20] up he went to zerath there he found a
[2:16:22] widow and the Widow fed him and then he
[2:16:25] raised her son but then you come to
[2:16:26] First Kings 18 now listen he's been in
[2:16:29] this drought he's been moved from
[2:16:31] cherith he's been moved in the zerath
[2:16:34] but now he comes to First Kings 18 and
[2:16:36] he goes up on Mount Caramel and there
[2:16:39] comes a showdown between God and Baal
[2:16:42] now watch this and they say these words
[2:16:44] he says prepare the altars Make Ready
[2:16:47] the altars for today we're going to have
[2:16:49] a showdown he said now here's what we're
[2:16:51] going to do we're going to build the
[2:16:53] altars
[2:16:56] identical wood on yours wood on mine
[2:17:00] Bullock Fair Bullock fair but there's
[2:17:02] one thing we're going to leave
[2:17:04] off what are we going to leave off
[2:17:07] church he said don't you put no fire on
[2:17:09] it because the God who answers by fire
[2:17:13] let him be God do you realize in first
[2:17:16] King 2 Kings 18 the Bible says this that
[2:17:20] Elijah went up there and he actually be
[2:17:22] to mock them and he begin to say maybe
[2:17:25] your God's asleep maybe he's on a
[2:17:28] holiday maybe he's per adventure and you
[2:17:30] can't wake him and they begin to cut
[2:17:33] themselves and begin to call on their
[2:17:36] gods they were trying to make something
[2:17:38] happen but Elijah stood there in his
[2:17:41] position as a Son of God with a secret
[2:17:44] special
[2:17:47] Revelation in his heart and here was the
[2:17:50] special Revelation the fire don't come
[2:17:53] till the evening
[2:17:55] time hello somebody the fire don't come
[2:17:58] till the evening time so the whole time
[2:18:01] they're trying to get something going
[2:18:03] trying to get their God answer Elijah
[2:18:05] just stands there full of enthusiasm
[2:18:08] because he knows that his God is going
[2:18:10] to show up in the evening time and
[2:18:14] confirm the
[2:18:16] sacrifice and about that time brother
[2:18:18] south of fire come down and the fire
[2:18:21] struck the Altar and the fire consumed
[2:18:24] the sacrifice and there the battle was
[2:18:26] settled who is
[2:18:29] God but then we go to 2 Kings 18:41 and
[2:18:33] the Bible says Elijah goes to Ahab and
[2:18:35] says get the up eat and drink for there
[2:18:37] is a there is a sound of an abundance of
[2:18:40] rain so Ahab went up to eat and drink
[2:18:42] and Elijah went up there to the Mount
[2:18:44] top of caramel and he cast himself down
[2:18:46] upon the Earth and put his face between
[2:18:48] his knees and said to his servant go up
[2:18:50] now and looked toward the sea and he
[2:18:52] went up and looked and said there is
[2:18:53] nothing and he said go again seven
[2:18:57] times go again seven times seven times
[2:19:01] seven times right oh seven Church ages
[2:19:04] right seven
[2:19:06] times seven Messengers seven times but
[2:19:11] it came to pass at the seventh time that
[2:19:14] his servant said behold there ariseth a
[2:19:17] little Cloud out of the sea like a man's
[2:19:19] hand and he he said go up and S Ahab
[2:19:22] prepare thy Chariot and get thee down
[2:19:26] that the rain stomp thee not and it came
[2:19:28] to pass in a little while that the
[2:19:30] heaven was black with clouds and wind
[2:19:31] and there was a great rain and Ahab rode
[2:19:34] and went to Jezreel and the Hand of the
[2:19:36] Lord was on Elijah and he GED up his
[2:19:39] loins and he ran before Ahab to the
[2:19:42] entrance of jezrael Amen can I can I
[2:19:44] read Joel 223 be ye glad then ye
[2:19:47] children of
[2:19:48] Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[2:19:52] for he hath given you the former rain
[2:19:55] modly and will cause to come down for
[2:19:57] you the rain the former rain and the
[2:20:00] latter rain in the first month do you
[2:20:02] see why the prophet prophesied I see
[2:20:05] great Joys ahead I see great revivals
[2:20:08] ahead I don't see this word dying I see
[2:20:11] this word moving
[2:20:13] forward because the pro God had that
[2:20:15] vision and he says there will be a
[2:20:17] teaching rain but then there will be a
[2:20:19] harvest rain can I say this to you
[2:20:21] tonight the Harvest rain amen is
[2:20:24] rapturing Faith and the pro of God said
[2:20:26] this he reads that and Elijah said an
[2:20:28] Ahab get the up and drink for there is a
[2:20:31] sound of an abundance of rain amen can I
[2:20:34] just say this to you it's not strange to
[2:20:36] me that he uses the word sound you know
[2:20:39] what the word sound means
[2:20:42] voice there is a sound amen which is a
[2:20:46] voice and he said go again seven times
[2:20:49] and behold it the seventh time time he
[2:20:51] said behold there ariseth a little Cloud
[2:20:53] out of the sea like a man's hand and he
[2:20:56] said go up the pr prepare thy chair now
[2:20:58] let me say this to you there arose amen
[2:21:01] a
[2:21:05] clout maybe I'm in your way there
[2:21:11] arose there arose a
[2:21:16] cloud before the cloud there was a sound
[2:21:21] and the sound was a voice and the Bible
[2:21:24] says in the days of the voice of the sth
[2:21:27] Angel when he shall begin to sound Bram
[2:21:29] comes along and says this he said see
[2:21:31] that Mystic something way up there in
[2:21:33] the Spheres they could not figure it out
[2:21:35] there was no evaporation or anything it
[2:21:38] was 30 Mi High 27 miles across coming
[2:21:41] right up from where those angels were
[2:21:43] now they asked to know amen science the
[2:21:46] one of them in Tucson wanted to know any
[2:21:47] significance but I didn't tell them
[2:21:52] I didn't tell them you know why he
[2:21:54] didn't tell them because it was only for
[2:21:57] the
[2:22:00] predestinated come on somebody if he
[2:22:03] would have told science they would have
[2:22:05] continued trying to figure it out tear
[2:22:07] it apart add to take away but he told
[2:22:10] some believers who had a jean seed in
[2:22:13] their soul that was going to follow that
[2:22:15] crowd they were going to follow that
[2:22:17] voice they were going to listen to that
[2:22:18] sound and as they follow that that cloud
[2:22:21] and they listen to that sound there's
[2:22:23] going to be Joy come in the church
[2:22:25] there's going to be Revival com in the
[2:22:27] church well I feel like closing on this
[2:22:29] point right here I don't see the cloud
[2:22:31] the size of a man's hand but I see the
[2:22:34] cloud the size of the son of man's face
[2:22:37] I see a clown it ain't the face of
[2:22:39] brother random it ain't the face of any
[2:22:41] other preacher it's the face of Jesus
[2:22:44] Christ and in him is quickening power in
[2:22:47] him is reality in him is healing
[2:22:52] brother can I say what a prophet said I
[2:22:54] believe right here tonight great
[2:22:56] sadnesses are going to be turned into
[2:22:58] great

[2:23:47] power let the word testify it's the
[2:23:49] truth and then in that they didn't know

[2:24:15] done what you will be quickening power
[2:24:19] all these things
[2:24:21] so you ask yourself for you ask ask me
[2:24:24] who said like this brother Andrew what
[2:24:25] is so
[2:24:26] significant about seeing this
[2:24:29] Cloud well first of all some people seen
[2:24:33] it and it enthused
[2:24:35] them others seen it and it embarrassed
[2:24:42] them but when I see you
[2:24:45] tonight when I see you tonight it don't
[2:24:48] embarrass me because because I know
[2:24:50] without this Cloud we might as well go
[2:24:53] play volleyball for the next two hours
[2:24:55] without this Cloud we might as well go
[2:24:57] just out there and drink coffee and just
[2:24:59] talk about the
[2:25:00] world but if this cloud is here devils
[2:25:04] are fixing to die if this cloud is here
[2:25:07] sicknesses are going to leave bodies if
[2:25:09] this cloud is here I hear the sound of
[2:25:13] an abundance of rain I hear quickening
[2:25:15] power I hear chains falling I hear
[2:25:18] demons running I hear SP spirit's
[2:25:20] breaking I hear sins falling off of the
[2:25:24] lives of God's
[2:25:25] children if the cloud is here we're not
[2:25:28] just a church member we are an
[2:25:30] invincible Army if the cloud is here
[2:25:33] greater is he that is in
[2:25:39] you you know what Satan wants to do
[2:25:42] Satan wants unbelief to catch you when
[2:25:44] you see that cloud brother said that's
[2:25:47] what he tried to do to Elijah now if
[2:25:49] unbelief now I just going to give you
[2:25:50] something here if unbelief would have C
[2:25:52] that right quick it would have said this
[2:25:54] if that's the best you can do see if
[2:25:57] that's all you can do we'll take it
[2:26:01] back could you imagine Brother Ray a
[2:26:03] spirit of unbelief getting a hold of
[2:26:05] Elijah and looking at that sign and
[2:26:07] saying if that's the best you can do
[2:26:09] well just take it back he said but what
[2:26:12] was it he was looking for the
[2:26:16] supernatural God have
[2:26:18] mercy he was looking for a cloud he was
[2:26:21] looking for the supernatural but the
[2:26:23] supernatural just happened to show up in
[2:26:25] a
[2:26:26] cloud glory to God I tell you what amen
[2:26:29] when they can you give me that third
[2:26:31] picture amen when they took a picture in
[2:26:33] Houston Coliseum they were looking for
[2:26:35] some pictures of fighting they were
[2:26:36] looking for some pictures of brother
[2:26:38] best or Dr best and brother Bosworth
[2:26:40] they weren't looking for that Pillar of
[2:26:42] Fire hey but that Pillar of Fire was
[2:26:44] looking for you so he had his
[2:26:46] picture he had his picture taken with
[2:26:49] the voice
[2:26:50] of the reality that would reveal the
[2:26:53] special Revelation can I say something
[2:26:55] to you can I say something to you do you
[2:26:57] realize the prophet of God said he said
[2:26:59] when they went to develop them pictures
[2:27:01] he said they tried six times he said the
[2:27:04] first picture didn't develop the third
[2:27:06] picture didn't develop the fifth picture
[2:27:07] didn't develop he said the sixth picture
[2:27:09] didn't develop he said but when the
[2:27:11] seventh picture developed he said they
[2:27:14] saw the filler of fire and they said
[2:27:16] that's a supernatural being can I say
[2:27:19] this he didn't see the cloud on the
[2:27:21] first time he didn't see the cloud on
[2:27:23] the third time but on the seventh time
[2:27:26] he saw the cloud and it was the
[2:27:28] announcing of an abundance of rain well
[2:27:30] young people I don't see what the world
[2:27:33] wants to see but I see what God wants me
[2:27:35] to see I don't just see brother brandom
[2:27:38] I see the pillar of fire but can I say
[2:27:40] this to you that Pillar of Fire is not
[2:27:43] just in that picture and it's not just
[2:27:45] in a filing cabinet in Washington DC but
[2:27:48] that pill of Fire is right here in this
[2:27:52] building tonight and you know what it's
[2:27:56] doing by the preaching of the message
[2:27:59] the pit of fire Brother Ray it's

[2:28:45] of a man's hand scream and holler I hear

[2:29:21] but I feel the influence of quickening
[2:29:24] power as it's moving across this
[2:29:27] building I hear the sound God had to if
[2:29:32] you reject and say well I didn't get
[2:29:33] nothing then they'll die out the hot
[2:29:36] waves of hell and doubt will fade it out
[2:29:37] of your soul but when you get that
[2:29:40] little grain of
[2:29:43] seed brother Gideon just stand on
[2:29:46] it it's not like the rock of jalter but
[2:29:50] but it's like the Rock of
[2:29:52] Ages now now now can you take a
[2:29:54] prophet's words I know you
[2:29:57] can stand there and you'll feel the
[2:30:04] sound
[2:30:06] feel the
[2:30:08] sound
[2:30:10] feel the
[2:30:12] sound of an abundance of
[2:30:15] rain really feel
[2:30:20] brother Noah feel the
[2:30:25] sound see right now the devil's trying
[2:30:28] to get you to say it's just a feeling
[2:30:30] but I'm getting ready to give that devil
[2:30:32] a black eye and identify what you're
[2:30:38] feeling you all have heard this story
[2:30:40] over and over how down there in Florida
[2:30:43] they built an Air Force Base right next
[2:30:45] us to a neighborhood you've heard that
[2:30:47] story right amen and there was a group
[2:30:48] of people got together and they went
[2:30:50] over there and they said listen they
[2:30:52] said we're tired of this noise we don't
[2:30:54] like all this amen I got to read a
[2:30:56] little bit on that one day and I found
[2:30:57] out really what was Bing them the most
[2:30:59] was not so much just the sound but they
[2:31:02] were getting tired of feeling the feel
[2:31:03] of the sound because when those planes
[2:31:05] would take off things would start
[2:31:07] shaking around the ground would start
[2:31:10] shaking listen I've been there a
[2:31:13] few amen things would start shaking
[2:31:16] around a few months ago brother brother
[2:31:18] Ron Peterson took me out there Amen to
[2:31:20] the Air Force Base there in Phoenix and
[2:31:22] we stood there and when those when those
[2:31:24] planes took off amen you're standing
[2:31:26] under them amen The Rock you're sitting
[2:31:27] on you feel it shaking amen everything
[2:31:30] around you shaking you can feel the
[2:31:32] sound of what's happening so they were
[2:31:35] not mad just because of the
[2:31:37] noise Oh Glory they were not mad just
[2:31:41] because of the noise they were mad
[2:31:43] because of the feel of the sound of the
[2:31:46] noise so you know what they said they
[2:31:48] went out there and wrote a banner you
[2:31:50] all know the story and the banner said
[2:31:52] this it said pardon the noise it's the
[2:31:55] sound of
[2:31:58] Freedom well you know what I found out I
[2:32:01] found out the devil he really don't mind
[2:32:04] the noise he don't mind the shouting he
[2:32:06] don't mind the rejoicing but what he
[2:32:08] hates is when those quotes become
[2:32:11] Revelation and he begins to feel the
[2:32:13] sound he begins to feel the sound of
[2:32:16] quickening power and it begins to
[2:32:18] Quicken your feet it begins to Quicken
[2:32:20] your hands it begins to Quicken your
[2:32:22] mind I stand here tonight and I say

[2:35:27] there you're not coming on this on this
[2:35:29] prayer line under imaginary
[2:35:32] interpretation under what some man
[2:35:34] thinks about this message you're not
[2:35:36] walking in this prayer line underneath a
[2:35:38] Frolic or a funeral procession
[2:35:41] approach you're walking through this
[2:35:43] prayer line under the headship of the
[2:35:47] revealing of the son of man
[2:35:50] can I say
[2:35:52] this he's
[2:36:01] here he's
[2:36:04] here how can you say
[2:36:07] that because a prophet of God said my
[2:36:10] Ministry is to declare him that he is am
[2:36:17] here he's here yes
[2:36:20] he's
[2:36:21] here don't question the
[2:36:25] rain don't question the symbol don't
[2:36:28] question the
[2:36:32] cloud accept
[2:36:36] it brother BR says it like this if you
[2:36:39] had an artisian well blowing up water on
[2:36:41] the side of the hill and your crop is
[2:36:42] burning you could holler all day long oh
[2:36:45] water come over here spring up water my
[2:36:47] crop so I have food you could holler
[2:36:50] till you couldn't holler no more it
[2:36:51] wouldn't act but if you'll work
[2:36:53] according to the laws of gravitation you
[2:36:55] can bring that water right around to
[2:36:57] your crop the law of electricity is
[2:37:00] right now here in this building right
[2:37:03] now if we walked in here and it was dark
[2:37:07] and there was no lights in here at all
[2:37:08] it was complete pitch black dark and you
[2:37:11] walked in and said oh light up the room
[2:37:14] light up the room oh great electricity I
[2:37:17] know you're here I know you're here
[2:37:19] light up the room brother BR said it
[2:37:20] never would
[2:37:23] work he said but if you'll go over there
[2:37:25] and flip the
[2:37:27] switch the law of electricity will come
[2:37:30] a
[2:37:32] manifestation and God doesn't heal the
[2:37:34] people just by going to church or making
[2:37:35] a confession he heals you upon your
[2:37:38] faith in his finished work it's your
[2:37:40] faith to accept what he has already
[2:37:45] done what are you saying brother anderw
[2:37:47] I'm saying tonight you see the
[2:37:51] cloud do you see the
[2:37:53] cloud can you bring it out of a picture
[2:37:57] can you bring it out of that picture and
[2:37:59] can you say Lord by the supernatural I
[2:38:02] see the
[2:38:03] cloud I see it tonight I see it hanging
[2:38:06] over my
[2:38:07] situation I see it hanging over this
[2:38:10] problem I see it hanging over this issue
[2:38:13] come on now I see the
[2:38:15] cloud it's not the size of a man's hand
[2:38:19] but it's the face of the son of
[2:38:20] man brother B says this healing comes
[2:38:23] from God now let me give this to you
[2:38:25] young people as you prepare to come
[2:38:26] through this prayer line tonight we just
[2:38:28] stand to our
[2:38:29] feet healing comes from God he's already
[2:38:34] done
[2:38:36] it can you accept that tonight he's
[2:38:40] already done it but if God could do
[2:38:44] something to make you understand that
[2:38:47] he's still here he's here
[2:38:50] to keep his
[2:38:52] promise now how many tonight will say
[2:38:54] Lord I'm done accepting the lies of the
[2:39:01] devil and we talked about imaginary
[2:39:04] interpretation and the devil will have
[2:39:07] you imagining ways to get out of
[2:39:09] things have you imagining ways that you
[2:39:12] can get above this sin and get above
[2:39:13] this besetting sin get above this habit
[2:39:16] you just can't break it so so here's
[2:39:17] what you're going to have to do you have
[2:39:19] to get this approach and his brother
[2:39:21] brother Nathan I believe was saying last
[2:39:22] night don't let's try this 10-step
[2:39:24] program or let's try this psychology
[2:39:26] approach that's imaginary
[2:39:29] interpretation but that cloud is not
[2:39:32] psychology and neither is that cloud a
[2:39:34] 10-step program that cloud is the Lord
[2:39:37] Jesus Christ and the Propet of God said
[2:39:40] the first thing you must do is surrender
[2:39:43] yourself entirely to Christ surrender
[2:39:46] your mind to his word and say Lord I
[2:39:48] want Act upon my feelings upon my own
[2:39:51] thoughts I will only act upon your word
[2:39:55] I'll have no control of my own thoughts
[2:39:57] concerning it I will act upon your word
[2:40:00] another place if this church right now
[2:40:02] could be put together and knitted
[2:40:04] together with such that every person
[2:40:05] would be in one Accord with not one Shad
[2:40:08] of Doubt anywhere there would not be a
[2:40:10] feeble person in our
[2:40:13] midst in another five minutes listen how
[2:40:17] many tonight would raise your hand
[2:40:18] honest and say you're desire iring the
[2:40:19] baptism the Holy Ghost you never had it
[2:40:21] you're Desiring the baptism Holy Ghost
[2:40:23] you're Desiring it tonight prophet of
[2:40:24] God said this there would not be nobody
[2:40:27] here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what
[2:40:29] would receive it if you could just get
[2:40:31] that certain thing fixed can I say this
[2:40:34] to you tonight the pillar of fire has
[2:40:36] fixed that certain thing it's not a man
[2:40:40] it's the word it's not upon on our
[2:40:43] feelings it's the word it's not upon our
[2:40:46] imagination or our conscience or our
[2:40:47] reason it's upon the word if you can
[2:40:50] bring your situation to the word tonight
[2:40:53] it's over I said it's over it's over if
[2:40:58] you can bring that situation to the word
[2:41:00] tonight depression is over confusion
[2:41:03] about the message is over listen he's
[2:41:06] already healed you he's already saved
[2:41:09] you he's already delivered you when you
[2:41:12] come to this prayer line tonight you're
[2:41:13] not coming looking to a man you're
[2:41:15] coming looking to the
[2:41:17] cloud he's already done
[2:41:21] it brother B says this now look don't
[2:41:24] you forget this when you pass to this
[2:41:26] line have your faith
[2:41:31] fixed fix your faith like this you ready
[2:41:34] for it when I come to the end of that
[2:41:38] line it's all
[2:41:43] over when I come to the end of that line
[2:41:47] it's all over can I take a step of fa
[2:41:49] and say this I believe some of you it's
[2:41:51] going to be over when you get to the
[2:41:52] front of the
[2:41:53] line and as you go through the line
[2:41:56] you're just going to go like this he

[4:49:23] [Music]
[4:49:34] in the year 1965 just before
[4:49:37] he passed off the scene brother Brandon
[4:49:39] began to
[4:49:43] major on that quickening power that
[4:49:45] brother Andrew was preaching about
[4:49:48] tonight many great
[4:49:51] messages that he preached on the
[4:49:56] subject one place I believe it was God's
[4:49:59] provided place of worship maybe
[4:50:01] shreport he even said
[4:50:04] that in the prayer lines he had moved
[4:50:08] away from using his own gift of
[4:50:10] discernment and move toward laying on of
[4:50:15] hands and
[4:50:17] see what I see
[4:50:20] there amen is a son of man of
[4:50:24] ministry that didn't pass off the earth
[4:50:27] when our Prophet passed off the
[4:50:30] Earth but the quickening power moved
[4:50:33] from a prophet's personal gift into a
[4:50:37] body and he would challenge the people
[4:50:39] to believe he would go from the
[4:50:40] beginning he said say you do believe the
[4:50:41] quickening power led the children of
[4:50:42] Israel through the Wilderness in the
[4:50:44] form of a pillar of fire you believe
[4:50:46] that the quickening power raised up
[4:50:49] Jesus Christ from the
[4:50:51] dead you believe that quickening power
[4:50:54] was in those Apostles in the upper room
[4:50:56] he said it was in their hands it was in
[4:50:58] their feet it was in their eyes it was
[4:51:00] in their
[4:51:02] mouths he said now do you believe that
[4:51:06] quickening power is in your hands
[4:51:10] am now this group of
[4:51:13] ministers that stood
[4:51:14] shoulder-to-shoulder
[4:51:16] tonight are not superhuman
[4:51:20] people just mortal
[4:51:23] men but a super
[4:51:25] God has commissioned us to lay hands
[4:51:30] upon the
[4:51:32] sick and they shall be
[4:51:35] healed and that is why we hold prayer
[4:51:37] lines and we will continue to hold
[4:51:40] prayer lines
[4:51:42] and we will continue to see that Mighty
[4:51:44] hand of God manifested Among
[4:51:48] Us because quickening power is in the
[4:51:52] Bride of Jesus
[4:51:53] Christ now let's move one step down now
[4:51:57] from the ministers do you believe that
[4:51:59] quickening power is in your
[4:52:02] hands after what you experienced tonight
[4:52:04] do you believe in that quickening power
[4:52:13] then let's do as the prophet
[4:52:16] said let's lay our hands upon one
[4:52:19] another tonight brother to brother
[4:52:20] sister to
[4:52:21] [Music]
[4:52:25] sister and let's go to him in prayer
[4:52:28] Lord
[4:52:31] Jesus we thank you for a
[4:52:34] message of quickening
[4:52:38] power this is far more than a religious
[4:52:42] tradition this is far greater than
[4:52:45] a than a private
[4:52:48] interpretation of a man-made
[4:52:51] [Music]
[4:52:53] Creed this is the literal life of Jesus
[4:52:57] Christ the same power that raised up
[4:53:00] Jesus from the dead has
[4:53:02] fallen into this building tonight and
[4:53:05] Quicken mortal
[4:53:07] bodies now as we lay our hands on one
[4:53:09] another I pray that that quickening
[4:53:12] power would run all through this
[4:53:14] building all through the body of Jesus
[4:53:16] Christ it's not superstitions of
[4:53:18] feelings and vibrations or electrical
[4:53:21] currents it's the Resurrection Life of
[4:53:24] Jesus Christ you promised it would be in
[4:53:27] your true church oh we believe it Lord
[4:53:30] for we have experienced it tonight and
[4:53:33] we thank you for it let that quickening
[4:53:35] power go to every need now and manifest
[4:53:39] the promises of God that we would leave
[4:53:41] this place in total victory
[4:53:44] tonight thank you Lord for your grace
