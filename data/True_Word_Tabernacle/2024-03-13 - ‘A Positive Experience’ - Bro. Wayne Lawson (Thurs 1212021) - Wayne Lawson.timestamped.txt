[4:36] Christ amen and amen and God bless you
[4:40] tonight and if we could we just want to
[4:42] turn into the book of uh 1 Corinthians
[4:45] chapter
[4:46] 14 and uh I want to take here for a
[4:49] reading tonight from 1 Corinthians 14
[4:52] and we want to read from the uh the eth
[4:55] verse again just a little something here
[4:58] in our heart and I I I'm praying about
[5:02] maybe going a certain direction and and
[5:04] I I believe the Lord just kind of
[5:06] leading uh me personally in my studies
[5:09] just leading me across something here
[5:10] tonight I just want to share with you in
[5:13] 1 Corinthians 14 and in the eth verse
[5:17] for if the trumpet would give an
[5:20] uncertain
[5:21] sound who should prepare himself to the
[5:26] battle amen God bless you as you be
[5:28] seated tonight amen uh I just spoke a
[5:31] little bit to you on Sunday from a
[5:34] thought of a positive gospel a positive
[5:37] gospel and I want to speak a little bit
[5:39] further on that tonight and I I just
[5:41] want to maybe take this title that a
[5:43] positive gospel produces a positive
[5:47] experience a positive gospel produces a
[5:51] positive experience I want a positive
[5:53] experience amen I I like things that are
[5:56] positive amen I love I love the things
[5:58] that are true and the things that are
[6:00] real I'm I'm I I just want to maybe
[6:03] reiterate something here from the word
[6:05] positive just in the English dictionary
[6:08] of the Webster there it says fully
[6:09] confident certain it means I'm positive
[6:13] I win it means having a real or
[6:16] beneficient effect or result they took a
[6:19] positive action I have a positive
[6:22] experience it means Beyond doubt it
[6:25] means
[6:27] unquestionable it means a positive proof
[6:30] it means showing acceptance or approval
[6:33] it's a positive response brother Bam
[6:36] from the message of trumpet gives an
[6:38] uncertain sound he says this I'm trying
[6:40] to tell you the things of the earth is
[6:41] shaken and you can't put any confidence
[6:44] in them they're uncertain and anything
[6:47] that's uncertain I'd rather leave away
[6:50] from it I don't like the negative thing
[6:53] I don't like to get mixed up in the
[6:55] negative side I like it positive to be
[6:57] on the positive side amen that's exactly
[7:00] where I want to be all the time is on
[7:02] the positive side I believe a Christian
[7:04] is positive I I believe that's what his
[7:06] whole life is about is being positive
[7:09] Amen brother brandom actually says that
[7:11] Christianity has no negative nothing in
[7:13] it everything is absolutely positive a
[7:17] man that becomes a child of God has a
[7:19] positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has
[7:21] a positive hold on him with the
[7:23] Assurance by the almighty God by an oath
[7:26] to himself that he will raise him up in
[7:28] the last day and and take to him to
[7:30] Glory there's uh no if or and or nothing
[7:34] it's something that's positive Amen
[7:37] brother B again Jehovah Gyra said
[7:39] Christianity has been misrepresented to
[7:41] people Christianity has been represented
[7:44] as a declaration of creed but
[7:46] Christianity is a living being it's a
[7:49] Jesus Christ the resurrected God that's
[7:52] alive Among Us now I really enjoyed that
[7:55] quote I wanted to read it again Jesus
[7:56] Christ amen Christianity is a living
[7:59] being I'd like to just preach a week on
[8:00] that Christianity is a living being it's
[8:03] not form or religion it's not
[8:05] denomination or Creed it's not theology
[8:08] it's a living being that's why the thing
[8:11] that we're doing it's something that's
[8:13] actually alive in us it's something that
[8:15] is living and it's feeding on the word
[8:17] of God Amen Christianity is a living
[8:20] being in mankind that's a proof of the
[8:23] resurrection of God's son who was God
[8:26] With Us amen and and uh hear ye him
[8:29] brother said that's the way real
[8:30] Christianity is a living experience and
[8:34] I I think that's amazing a positive
[8:37] gospel produces a positive experience
[8:41] amen Pentecost is not a denomination
[8:44] Pentecost is an experience that anybody
[8:46] can have if they wish to have it if
[8:49] something that you experience it's the
[8:52] Holy Spirit I'll tell you what I I than
[8:55] the Lord tonight amen to be a part of a
[8:57] group amen that really believes in the
[8:59] experience of the Holy Ghost that
[9:01] believes in the the moving of the Holy
[9:03] Spirit and amen I I appreciate last
[9:06] Sunday amen we had the youth had a
[9:08] meeting after our meeting and and uh I
[9:11] heard that the spirit of God just come
[9:13] and amened and sanctioned that service
[9:15] and amen what a wonderful blessing I I
[9:17] tell you something I'm I appreciate
[9:19] brother Nathan brother Ronnie and all
[9:21] the people that uh that are involved in
[9:23] these youth meetings and they're
[9:24] preaching them and they're praying and
[9:26] the sacrifice of you mothers and fathers
[9:28] to to bring your children or make sure
[9:31] they get here and all the musicians and
[9:33] their Sunday evenings God bless you for
[9:35] what you're doing these are Eternal
[9:37] things that we're talking about amen and
[9:39] and to think amen that these things were
[9:41] not just a not just a little flyby but I
[9:44] I tell you a lot of the young people
[9:46] come to my house afterwards and we had a
[9:47] couple pizzas and things and we were all
[9:49] sitting around there and it turned out
[9:51] about midnight and still no Ronnie no
[9:53] Isaac and couldn't they couldn't figure
[9:54] out where they were and all finally I
[9:56] said hey look guys man there's a revival
[9:58] going on them boys is up there in the
[10:00] altar praying it's Amen that that's not
[10:02] old news I remember when I first got
[10:04] saved it wasn't no big deal at all to be
[10:06] 1:00 2:00 in the morning up there at the
[10:09] house of God shouting and dancing and
[10:11] snotting and rejoicing and I tell you
[10:13] you can get something that'll stick with
[10:15] you longer than just a a couple days or
[10:17] just a little something amen amen but I
[10:20] think it was long about 6:00 in the
[10:22] morning before they before they got out
[10:24] out of that anointing I think somebody
[10:25] said Sister Mary come up and was going
[10:27] to touch Isaac or something and the
[10:29] spirit got on her and she got out in the
[10:31] that's just what they told me now is
[10:33] that the truth sister Mary amen I tell
[10:35] you you got to watch her now she's a
[10:36] holy ghost woman she get somewhere
[10:38] around it and she's she just gets
[10:40] connected to it amen amen and and I I I
[10:42] heard that the spirit of God was being
[10:44] poured out like that and then and and
[10:46] little did we know uh we got to have
[10:48] supper with the Kegley family last night
[10:50] and sister Mariah was telling us how the
[10:52] Lord had give her the Holy Ghost right
[10:54] in the middle of that meeting amen do
[10:56] you know uh uh did anybody else receive
[10:59] the holy ghost in that meeting did
[11:01] anybody else just throw your hand up now
[11:03] don't be ashamed of did anybody else get
[11:04] the Holy Ghost did anybody else get a
[11:06] refilling of the Holy Ghost on last
[11:07] Sunday amen look at these Hearts amen
[11:10] amen people were getting there was
[11:11] somebody back there Bond tracker wasn't
[11:12] it God bless you sis amen receive the
[11:14] Holy Ghost on Sunday night listen that
[11:16] one soul is worth 10,000 worlds amen do
[11:21] you recognize the prophet of God said
[11:22] Billy Graham would go into a community
[11:24] and win 30,000 and come back and
[11:26] couldn't find one he said but Paul on
[11:29] the other hand took his converts Beyond
[11:31] just a a confession or just a decision
[11:34] and he said Paul would convert one and
[11:37] come back and find 30 or 30,000 amen
[11:40] because it's a real conversion it's
[11:42] something that don't turn it don't back
[11:44] away it's more than just a decision or
[11:46] or just a little made up their mind but
[11:48] it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:50] something that that changes the soul
[11:53] amen amen I'm convinced amen that there
[11:55] is a a power in this gospel I'm
[11:57] convinced there's a life Chang in power
[12:00] amen I'm one that believes in a positive
[12:02] gospel amen that somebody that is
[12:04] certain that it works preaches the
[12:07] certainty of the Gospel that there's a
[12:09] power of the Resurrection behind that
[12:11] and it is a lifechanging experience
[12:14] coming to the Church of the Living God
[12:16] is not just coming to hear a little
[12:18] lesson or a teaching it ought to be a
[12:21] positive experience it ought to be life
[12:23] changing amen I believe people can come
[12:25] inside the gates of the Church of the
[12:27] Living God and walk out and be Eternal
[12:30] creatures and and never look back and I
[12:32] I believe that I believe that change can
[12:34] happen in the middle of a service I'm
[12:36] just speaking last night for Bible
[12:38] Believers and and God just put it on my
[12:40] heart I just contined with positive
[12:41] gospel but I was speaking for brother
[12:43] Jonathan last night in the middle of it
[12:44] brother brother Ed quinland was sitting
[12:46] there and he said he was sitting there
[12:48] with so much back pain and he said all
[12:50] of a sudden he began to say Amen instead
[12:52] of saying Lord Heal my back pain Lord
[12:54] Heal my back pain he said right in the
[12:56] middle of that of because I was
[12:58] preaching a positive God El amen it's
[13:00] already here and he said right in the
[13:01] middle of it he said I just begin to say
[13:03] Lord I Thank you for my healing amen I
[13:06] thank you for my healing and he said
[13:07] right when I begin to praise God for my
[13:10] healing the back pain left me can can I
[13:12] can I say something to you tonight this
[13:14] is a positive gospel this ain't coming
[13:17] it's already here your blessing's not
[13:20] coming it's already here listen to me
[13:22] your salvation's not coming it's already
[13:25] here the Holy Ghost is not on the way
[13:28] the Holy Ghost is right here in this
[13:30] building tonight there is a way tonight
[13:33] that a Believer can break beyond the
[13:35] Realms of humanity and experience a
[13:38] living God Amen oh to think tonight that
[13:41] we don't have to be satisfied on a
[13:43] denominational fountain or or the
[13:45] Fountain of Creeds amen but we can hook
[13:48] up to elshad and we can draw from the
[13:51] breast of the word of God eternal life
[13:54] will flow right down into that body back
[13:56] pain leaving right in the middle of a
[13:58] church service
[13:59] I I tell you I'm talking about
[14:01] experience tonight amen I remember
[14:03] preaching this same gospel not too many
[14:05] years ago and a person was sitting there
[14:07] with cancer right in the middle of the
[14:09] meeting and jumped up and said I got to
[14:11] testify I come in this meeting with
[14:13] cancer but it just fell off of me I am
[14:16] completely healed do you know you're
[14:18] living in a season when God Amen don't
[14:21] have to heal cancer but it's already
[14:23] healed amen that that the healing power
[14:27] is Flowing from Calvary amen that 2,000
[14:31] years ago I hear Jesus Christ scream it
[14:34] is finished your healing is finished
[14:38] youen your deliverance is finished every
[14:40] spell is broken Every curse is broken
[14:44] every disease is been destroyed amen
[14:46] then the only thing we need to do today
[14:49] is open up our hearts and receive the
[14:52] blessings of God that has already been
[14:55] given I don't care how many Devils says
[14:57] it ain't true I'll be standing ending on
[14:59] the word of God when this whole world
[15:02] falls apart amen because it's exactly a
[15:05] positive word for a positive experience
[15:08] amen we're not here tonight on Hope
[15:10] Souls than Souls baby Souls amen but
[15:13] there has been something that we're
[15:15] certain we're certain about what it is
[15:18] now I I I'm very I'm very aware that
[15:20] we're intellectual people and and we we
[15:23] can read and write and learn and and
[15:25] thank God we do because amen we got we
[15:27] got Geniuses and doctors and nurses and
[15:30] scientists and electricians and
[15:32] engineers and we put amen and thank God
[15:34] for for the natural world those things
[15:36] are wonderful but when it comes to the
[15:39] things of God those things are useless
[15:41] amen and and we've recognized a long
[15:43] time ago that we can quickly reach the
[15:46] summit of intellectualism and man cannot
[15:49] climb Beyond his own understanding but
[15:52] according to the Bible he said if you
[15:54] will not lean to your own understanding
[15:57] amen that God is ask asking somebody to
[16:00] step out beyond the understanding beyond
[16:03] what they can think or they can imagine
[16:05] do you know that you're serving a god
[16:07] tonight that can do things that you
[16:09] can't even imagine that he can do things
[16:11] above what you can think or ask you
[16:14] can't even ask as high as what God is
[16:17] able to do you can't even imagine what
[16:20] God is able to do amen I don't know what
[16:22] God is going to do for you but he said
[16:25] Abraham I have already blessed you amen
[16:28] and the the blessings of God are already
[16:31] on the Church of the Living God I don't
[16:33] know about you but I'm just ready to say
[16:35] I don't understand it but by the grace
[16:37] of God there is something in me that
[16:39] believes it no matter what I see no
[16:42] matter what I taste no matter what I
[16:43] feel I still just believe it anyhow my
[16:47] goodness amen and we might look like a
[16:49] bunch of fellas out here just a bunch of
[16:51] fanatics but we're not amen and I don't
[16:53] say that trying to save myself I'm
[16:55] trying to say there's a middle of the
[16:56] road somewhere amen and that middle of
[16:59] the road amen is not Co formal and
[17:02] lukewarm it's not just that formalism of
[17:05] of just reading a little and saying amen
[17:07] and singing two songs and going home the
[17:10] middle of the road or the balance is the
[17:12] word of God Amen and I can show you by
[17:15] the word of God that the church can have
[17:18] an acts to experience they can have an
[17:21] upper room experience matter of fact
[17:23] Peter promised this to every man that
[17:26] God calls you can have the same
[17:28] experience
[17:29] of a Bible Holy Ghost just like they had
[17:32] in the upper room I am not a fanatic I
[17:35] am not a crazy man I am a believer I am
[17:38] a butd bought Bible believing Christian
[17:41] a son of the Living God if you want to
[17:44] say it I'm a tongue talking Blood Washed
[17:47] baptized Holy Ghost filled son of the
[17:49] Living God I'm not giving up I'm not
[17:52] turning around I'm not going to lay
[17:54] myself down in the presence of a devil
[17:57] I'm not bow my knee to formalism I'm not
[18:00] bound my knee to the ways of man but by
[18:03] the grace of God I will preach a
[18:05] positive gospel until every Son of God
[18:08] is filled with the Holy Ghost every
[18:10] daughter and every child has a place and
[18:13] an experience for
[18:16] God so brother Wayne you ain't deep
[18:19] enough you don't tell what you get after
[18:20] a while you get so deep you get in a
[18:23] rut and you know what a rut is it's just
[18:26] a grave amen and that's why the prophet
[18:28] said twofold more child of hell that's
[18:31] what they made him he said twice dead
[18:33] and plucked up he said dead amen the the
[18:36] th themometer has went below zero he
[18:39] said with every degree you got colder
[18:42] colder with every degree with every
[18:44] intellectual sermon you got more
[18:46] arrogant more stiff necked amen more
[18:48] entitled more amen you got to have me
[18:51] you got to believe me amen but look at
[18:53] what the power of the Holy Ghost will do
[18:55] it'll take a man like Simon Peter amen
[18:58] and humble him to the place that he was
[19:01] ready to be hung upside down for the
[19:03] experience of God and let me tell you
[19:05] tonight I believe there's some people
[19:07] alive that still believes that the same
[19:10] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[19:13] forever amen and if we're preaching
[19:15] something different than Paul preached
[19:17] there's something wrong with what we're
[19:22] preaching now we might as well just get
[19:24] straight haven't we we're Believers
[19:26] right amen that's why the young people
[19:28] are going back to the world that's why
[19:30] the young people are going back to the
[19:32] world even while they're in the church
[19:34] they might be in the church but they're
[19:35] really in the world and it's actually
[19:37] just setting in the church but really
[19:39] their hearts is in the world I tell you
[19:41] why because the world offers something
[19:43] amen that's a pull upon their flesh well
[19:46] I pray to God tonight that the church
[19:48] has a greater draw than the world I pray
[19:51] that there's a fire of the Holy Ghost
[19:53] had will pull the young people into the
[19:55] places of altars I actually had a down
[19:59] minister in this message tell me one day
[20:01] brother Wayne we don't want you people
[20:02] to pull the people to an altar we want
[20:05] you to tell them what you know how I
[20:07] tell you this I tell you what I know I
[20:09] know that nothing will change a man's
[20:11] heart but the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:13] I can't talk a man out of sin I can't
[20:15] preach a man out of sin but if I can get
[20:18] that man in contact with the Creator
[20:21] he'll change his nature and you'll never
[20:24] be the same again every child every
[20:26] daughter every man needs experience with
[20:29] the Holy Ghost and without that
[20:31] experience there'll be no Rapture
[20:33] there'll be no faith there'll be no
[20:38] Revival glory be to God that's why so
[20:41] many young people brother bam said
[20:43] that's why there's no move CU there's
[20:45] nothing to put Sparks on he said there's
[20:48] there's a of course there's a train but
[20:50] no movement a car but no movement
[20:52] because a a movement needs both gas and
[20:56] and the
[20:57] spark
[20:59] now that word is gasoline isn't it
[21:02] that's what the prophet said and he said
[21:04] now if it don't if it don't do nothing
[21:06] but sputter maybe it's not
[21:09] gasoline and some of these great
[21:11] teachers that we have in this message
[21:13] had put the fires of God out they've not
[21:15] moved the message further amen they
[21:17] ground it down and made it a negative
[21:20] experience and they made it where you
[21:22] leave church more beat down than when
[21:23] you come in you feel more legal and law
[21:26] and you feel less and less amen but
[21:29] something somewhere has got to energize
[21:32] the inner soul of a man to make him know
[21:35] that this body is a lie this world is a
[21:38] lie but there's something in me amen the
[21:41] real me come from God to begin with and
[21:44] there's only one thing that can make
[21:46] that connection one thing can make that
[21:48] connection between you and
[21:50] God my teaching ain't going to do it
[21:52] friend I'm I'm I'm sorry amen I I hope
[21:54] to say I'm a good teacher and I believe
[21:56] in Bible teaching amen but I know the
[21:58] only thing make the connection to you is
[22:00] the spirit of God you know the brother B
[22:02] said that's a positive and this is a
[22:04] negative this life we're living is a
[22:06] negative and that life is a positive is
[22:09] that right amen now I'm just a dumb old
[22:12] hillbilly and I just got simple ways but
[22:14] if I go out in my in my yard and there's
[22:17] an old battery been laying believe me in
[22:18] Arkansas probably had some of them two
[22:20] or three years I tried to clean it up
[22:22] here in a while a little bit amen but I
[22:25] I had some old batteries just to fit in
[22:26] my neighborhood good had a couple old
[22:28] batteries laying around and you get out
[22:30] there and want to put one of them on
[22:31] your bow or on your truck amen and you
[22:33] wonder amen is that thing got any life
[22:35] in it is that thing got any charge now
[22:38] the only way to find that out young
[22:39] people is you got to have you go get
[22:41] your metal bar simple way to do it get a
[22:43] metal bar and put it on the negative and
[22:45] then touch it on the positive now don't
[22:47] try it on your daddy's truck though but
[22:49] and you put it on the negative and touch
[22:51] it on the positive now if you can put
[22:53] both of them together at the same time
[22:55] if you can touch both at the same time
[22:58] you know what I'm going to say there's a
[23:00] there's a charge there there's a spark
[23:02] there's a spark of Dynamics there there
[23:05] is something that comes back to you that
[23:08] there's life in there now the
[23:09] denominational message a theological
[23:12] message does not have the ability to
[23:15] touch this realm and that realm at the
[23:18] same time the their their stick is too
[23:21] short it cannot carry the current amen
[23:24] but the message of the hour has brought
[23:27] us a holy ghost anointing
[23:29] that can reach from this realm to the
[23:31] other realm at the same time it's so far
[23:34] that a prophet of God said when you
[23:36] recognize this word to be Eagle food you
[23:40] have heard from your theophany amen why
[23:43] is it that the people are begin to
[23:45] rejoice in the middle of a church why AR
[23:48] people shout and holler and scream and
[23:50] rejoice is all that really necessary
[23:52] well I tell you what a prophet said he
[23:53] said when you see all that going on
[23:55] what's really happening is there's an
[23:57] unseen Force these me if somebody if
[23:59] something's happening there's something
[24:01] making it happen now you tell me if
[24:03] that's the devil or God I'll tell you
[24:05] what brother random said it was he said
[24:07] the person has bumped into an angel amen
[24:10] and something is charging them amen
[24:12] maybe it is amen I maybe they throw me
[24:14] out the message from my theology but I
[24:16] believe this I believe we got a
[24:18] theophany right now I don't believe
[24:20] God's going to make one I believe we got
[24:22] one waiting right now and I believe once
[24:24] in a while and we come in the house of
[24:26] God and the word by the spirit
[24:28] connects us to that the offering for
[24:31] just a moment and we charge amen there's
[24:34] a dynamic blast in the Church of the
[24:36] Living God that's why somebody wants to
[24:39] shout a little bit that's why somebody
[24:42] wants to run the pews a little bit
[24:44] because they got a charge in the
[24:46] Dynamics and it falls on
[24:52] gasoline amen by now I've been I've been
[24:54] involved in enough meetings you let a
[24:56] little fire start and you you got some
[24:59] some Theologian will get up there and
[25:01] he'll just keep calming it all down till
[25:03] he gets everybody in the seat get every
[25:05] bit of that killed out make sure nobody
[25:07] gets no Wildfire well I tell you amen as
[25:10] a Spire a chance of it among most people
[25:12] amen because every time there's a little
[25:15] spark they pour water on it amen but I'm
[25:18] going to tell you what there is some
[25:20] fire amen and that fire I I have
[25:23] testified I got to testify there's a
[25:25] fire in this church I don't care if I'm
[25:27] a part of it or not if I was on the
[25:29] outside looking in I would have to
[25:31] testify them people got a fire up there
[25:33] amen then if there's a fire in here amen
[25:36] then God helped me to pour some gasoline
[25:39] on the fire of God rather than pouring a
[25:41] bunch of water and a bunch of legalism
[25:44] and a bunch of ideas of man God help us
[25:47] to Fan the Flames of the baptism of the
[25:50] Holy Ghost until it catches and blows
[25:54] across the Church of the Living God I
[25:56] feel the Winds of God from the fire of
[25:59] God the Winds of Change The Winds of
[26:01] Promise The Winds of
[26:06] [Music]

[26:31] is something that is moving it from the
[26:34] head down to the heart can I say this
[26:36] the move is on the word is moving into
[26:40] the heart of the Bride of Jesus
[26:43] Christ I'm not trying to put you under
[26:45] pressure to shout I'm not trying to put
[26:47] you under pressure to act a certain way
[26:50] I'm trying to give you Liberty I'm
[26:52] trying to tell you that if it's in your
[26:54] heart Amen to rejoice and enjoy God and
[26:57] experience the the holy ghost that this
[26:59] promise is unto you and unto your
[27:02] children amen you can have the blessings
[27:05] of
[27:07] God I tell you Paul Razer said it well
[27:10] I'm riding on it amen we're not trying
[27:12] to produce it we're not trying to
[27:14] manufactur it we're riding on the
[27:16] promises that God has gave the church
[27:18] are you hearing me amen your name is
[27:20] Rebecca right your name is Rebecca amen
[27:23] what was Rebecca doing after elaser left
[27:26] her she got on a camel and that Camel
[27:29] was taking her to her Isaac let me tell
[27:31] you something tonight there's some
[27:33] people that is riding the camel amen of
[27:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the
[27:39] power that is moving the
[27:43] [Applause]
[27:46] church now what's the beaut what's the
[27:49] beauty of that something's moving us
[27:51] something's something we're riding
[27:53] something it's not a National Force now
[27:55] amen it's not a National Force but look
[27:57] at that look at how rigid we can
[28:00] become now watch this look how rigid we
[28:02] can become we can get stiff in our we
[28:05] can get stiff in our experience until
[28:07] even the way I just said that about
[28:09] Rebecca riding that Camel will bring up
[28:11] a theological critic right in the middle
[28:13] of the church and I can pick their
[28:15] Spirit up right when they do it amen and
[28:17] usually I don't call them out but I want
[28:19] you to know you'll never have a Revival
[28:20] with that Spirit on you you'll be cold
[28:23] and you'll be critic and you'll be a
[28:24] jealous man the rest of your life but if
[28:27] you could ever turn a loose of that
[28:29] critical spirit and let the Holy Ghost
[28:31] begin to deal with you you would know
[28:33] that there's a power in this building
[28:35] right now that's beyond the ideas of
[28:38] just a theology there's an anointing
[28:41] that'll change your
[28:46] [Applause]
[28:47] life glory to
[28:49] God don't worry I won't call their name
[28:52] amen glory to God Amen look there's a
[28:55] positive thinking there's a positive
[28:57] experience there's a positive
[29:00] way there's something positive that will
[29:03] cause you to
[29:05] change it'll cause a change in you you
[29:08] don't have to stay that way you don't
[29:10] have to stay all all dry and and in a
[29:13] place where you can't be moved by the
[29:16] spirit where the God can't deal with you
[29:18] brother B said the basis of a Revival is
[29:21] flexibility and he said the flexibility
[29:23] was the new wine he said watch how that
[29:26] you can't put new wine in old bottle he
[29:29] said why because they're animal skins
[29:31] and animal skins dry out unless you oil
[29:34] them up good and what we need amen is a
[29:37] baptism in the all of God to make us
[29:40] loose again to make us movable
[29:44] [Music]
[29:46] again hallelujah
[29:49] hallelujah you know you can go to a
[29:51] place right now where you can dwell in a
[29:52] positive realm amen you can go into a
[29:55] realm Beyond negative Thinking Beyond
[29:58] negative things you can go in a realm
[30:00] where all things are possible where all
[30:02] things are certain where all things are
[30:04] a reality in Romans the 12th chapter
[30:06] Paul actually said be you transformed by
[30:09] the renewing of your mind he wasn't
[30:11] intellectually speaking he was speaking
[30:14] about a change of the mind that went
[30:16] deeper than the change of the way you
[30:18] think it went into the mind of God who
[30:21] he said be renewed in the spirit of your
[30:23] mind it's beautiful that Paul says in
[30:25] Philippians 2 to let us and Amen to let
[30:29] the mind of Christ come into us now
[30:32] that's a that's a surrender word let it
[30:35] means you got to let it happen you got
[30:38] to actually open your heart and let it
[30:40] happen he said I stand at the door and
[30:42] knock and if any man would open up it's
[30:45] Jesus standing there knocking at his own
[30:47] house amen I I don't know how long
[30:49] you're going to let him knock how long
[30:51] you're going to let him stand there amen
[30:53] how long you going to leave him and Le
[30:54] de sea with no drink with no cool drink
[30:58] water from the presence of God Amen but
[31:00] I'll tell you this somebody's going to
[31:02] let it happen somebody's going to open
[31:05] up their heart somebody's going to say
[31:07] Come Into My Heart
[31:10] Lord amen watch that same mind now that
[31:13] same mind that was in Christ is being
[31:15] poured into the church he said riding to
[31:18] every man every individual that's got
[31:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same
[31:22] creator that was in heaven amen that
[31:25] created the earth created the man is
[31:27] right in every individual that's got the
[31:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what
[31:32] he says in the seven seal he says when
[31:34] the supernatural comes in that's the
[31:36] mind of
[31:38] Christ I think brother Ray took a whole
[31:40] whole whole series on that back a few
[31:42] years ago amen when the supernatural
[31:44] comes in that's the mind of Christ amen
[31:48] it's it's not it's not it's not thinking
[31:51] it's the supernatural because it's so
[31:54] far away from the way we think as humans
[31:57] amen watch this a supernatural
[31:59] atmosphere amen look at this the
[32:01] supernatural comes in and the
[32:03] supernatural Works in an atmosphere do
[32:05] you know that the atmosphere you're in
[32:07] is of the greatest effect upon the
[32:09] church service that the greatest thing
[32:11] that can happen in church is atmosphere
[32:13] that's why we pray for our song leader
[32:16] that's why we pray for our musicians
[32:18] that's why we come to church a little
[32:19] early and begin to pray and get in and
[32:22] and we just move along with the service
[32:24] amen amen and and and rather than
[32:26] feeling resistant against the way he
[32:28] feels LED get in and let the spirit
[32:31] begin to lead the song service let the
[32:34] angel of the Lord begin to come over and
[32:36] hover over the church what's going on in
[32:38] atmosphere amen is being created amen
[32:42] y'all know that we can't help a little
[32:44] chicken pick out of the egg we done
[32:45] establish that but we can create an
[32:48] atmosphere that'll keep them alive till
[32:50] they get out of the egg we can create an
[32:53] atmosphere in the church until a young
[32:55] person can feel the possession even
[32:58] inside the shell something that's
[33:00] telling it just keep moving little fella
[33:03] and you'll come out before
[33:05] long now that human part amen that human
[33:09] part that human part is where our
[33:11] troubles
[33:12] are now I I know this I know this
[33:15] without a sh of a doubt amen I'm I'm my
[33:17] biggest
[33:19] enemy and you're your biggest enemy
[33:22] brother Ram said he was his biggest
[33:23] enemy so the biggest enemy I got in the
[33:26] church is me the biggest enemy I got in
[33:28] the world is me do you know if I could
[33:31] just get me out of the way that God
[33:33] could live amen unhindered if I could
[33:36] just get me out of the way God could
[33:38] preach unhindered if I could just get me
[33:41] out of the way do you see amen then
[33:42] there's a human part that's you that's
[33:45] the human part but there's a deity part
[33:48] in there that's the supernatural God
[33:50] that's been poured in there that wants
[33:52] an expression but your human part gets
[33:55] in the way because you're looking at the
[33:57] thing and you're looking at the trials
[33:59] and you're looking at the struggles and
[34:00] you're looking at the problems but by
[34:02] doing that you're grounding out the
[34:05] positive where that it cannot reflect
[34:07] through your life amen but what we
[34:09] really need is a letting go we really
[34:11] need a Divine surrender Amen to the
[34:14] place of letting flow through US
[34:16] everything that God has GI to us as a
[34:18] church amen I'll tell you this you can
[34:21] come in a supernatural atmosphere there
[34:23] in the church is a supernatural element
[34:25] there is the supernatural mind of God
[34:28] amen and all of this is happening to
[34:30] give us a positive Faith amen isn't it
[34:33] beautiful to have real faith not just to
[34:36] I felt good in the service or or
[34:38] something swept over me and I think
[34:39] things are better amen but a real
[34:41] Dynamic change something that moved you
[34:44] from Hope to Faith something that moved
[34:47] you from being a quote in your mind to
[34:49] something that you would give your life
[34:51] for something that moves into your heart
[34:53] brother bandam says it like this he said
[34:55] so we want to change from Hope today to
[34:58] positive Faith there's only one way we
[35:01] can get positive Faith that's by
[35:03] positive thinking of positive things now
[35:07] a positive thinking watch oh my because
[35:09] now you're getting into the intellectual
[35:11] think positive think positive think
[35:12] positive but William Brandon was not
[35:14] talking about that kind of positive
[35:16] thinking a true positive thought is a
[35:20] supernatural element of God that places
[35:23] the mind of God in you amen where did
[35:26] Moses ever get the idea to part the Red
[35:29] Sea by the spoken word he didn't get
[35:32] that out of a human mind amen but God
[35:35] placed that in his mind where did
[35:37] William brandom get the idea of creating
[35:40] squirrels he didn't come out of his mind
[35:42] but God placed it in his mind then the
[35:45] supernatural Mind Of God is a positive
[35:49] thought do you see that it's a certain
[35:51] thought it's not a thought of
[35:54] uncertainty it's a positive thought it's
[35:57] a positive Faith amen now watch this so
[36:00] we want to change amen don't let that
[36:03] don't let that negative thing I talked
[36:05] about don't let it hang on the church
[36:06] and you say well by the way you was
[36:08] talking to me just repent of it then and
[36:09] just move on don't don't let it hang on
[36:11] you now that's what I'm talking about
[36:14] you let a negative carry you Amen to
[36:16] where it brings you below the atmosphere
[36:18] where eagles are supposed to soar amen
[36:21] so when you identify that the spirit
[36:23] amen rebukes something you're thinking
[36:26] then you just say hey repent of that and
[36:28] then let the spirit move you amen if if
[36:31] if a man is preaching and you're doing
[36:34] something wrong in the middle of the
[36:35] service and he calls out maybe he don't
[36:37] even know what he's talking about he
[36:39] just says something about something
[36:40] you're doing amen watch how that'll
[36:42] affect you in the middle of a service
[36:43] it'll pull you down down cuz you're
[36:45] identifying with that but you got to
[36:47] quit identifying with the negative amen
[36:50] and that's what the blood is for you got
[36:52] to say yeah I did it but God I'm sorry I
[36:54] did it now let me ask you how long does
[36:57] it take take God to forgive you brother
[36:59] brandom says the moment in your heart
[37:01] that you said I'm sorry that's when God
[37:03] forgave you do you know right now you
[37:06] could say oh God don't never let me
[37:08] think that way again amen and the Holy
[37:11] Ghost can burn that out of your
[37:15] [Applause]
[37:17] life it's a positive thing it's a
[37:20] positive do not identify in the negative
[37:24] don't don't ground yourself down don't
[37:26] tie yourself down to that that that's
[37:28] not the real
[37:31] you that's not who you really
[37:33] are that's not who you really are you're
[37:37] really a child of God You Really Want To
[37:39] Worship You Really Want to Be Free you
[37:42] really want to love everybody you really
[37:44] want to live for God you really want
[37:46] everybody to love you you really don't
[37:48] want to live in that state amen then
[37:50] rebuke that devil and say I'm walking
[37:53] out of here tonight I'm going to be free
[37:56] I'm going to be Freer than ever been I'm
[37:58] going to be so free I don't know if my
[38:00] Feet's going to touch the ground I don't
[38:03] usually evangelize our own church amen
[38:05] but I feel a bit like an evangelist
[38:07] right now I think it's time to break the
[38:09] shackles I think it's time Amen to lay
[38:12] aside every weight and every devil and
[38:15] every feeling anything that ties you
[38:17] down I think it's time to break it Loose
[38:20] that ain't nothing but the devil trying
[38:22] to tie
[38:26] you you know that's the truth come on
[38:29] brother Ram said listen faith is
[38:32] positive faith is not negative faith is
[38:35] positive preaching about your faith
[38:36] faith is
[38:37] positive amen I heard sister Faith tore
[38:40] the church up the other night she ain't

[48:20] life I am not reading from an almanac
[48:23] I'm reading from a prophet of God that
[48:26] said that the baptism of the spirit of
[48:28] God is a definite
[48:31] experience and a man cannot receive the
[48:34] Holy Ghost without an experience brother

[50:06] God Amen that same spirit is in here
[50:10] tonight I'm not trying to imitate a
[50:12] prophet the word itself is a discerner
[50:15] when you preach the
[50:18] gospel it should do more then tickle

[51:03] hearts and change lives amen this don't
[51:05] just happen somebody has to build this
[51:08] somebody has to prep this somebody has
[51:11] to put the people in a trained position
[51:13] that when the Dynamics of God comes they
[51:16] don't push it away they embrace it amen

[51:34] experiences I was not born for
[51:37] it I was not birthed for it and I will
[51:39] die in that
[51:42] atmosphere but there is an atmosphere I
[51:44] was born to live in there was one where
[51:47] the anointing comes by and picks me up
[51:49] above who I am that when that comes up
[51:53] and picks me up to the person that's
[51:54] down inside my being
[51:58] that one that can say Amen to every word
[52:00] that one that can back every
[52:02] promise listen tonight friends this is a
[52:06] reality it's a positive experience won't
[52:08] you come tonight won't the musicians
[52:10] come tonight this is a positive
[52:14] experience it's not an uncertain one
[52:16] this is not an uncertain experience this
[52:18] is a positive
[52:20] one don't you know that you're supposed
[52:22] to know that you know that you know with
[52:26] without of Doubt what that is now why
[52:30] why would a prophet say that you need to
[52:31] know that you know do you know the way
[52:33] brother Ram said this he said you
[52:35] actually need to come out on the sacred
[52:38] Sands of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:41] you know most people when they refer to
[52:42] the Holy Ghost mean it something bad
[52:44] about it they refer to it in a negative
[52:47] condentation but brother Bram said it
[52:49] was called The Sacred Sands and if you
[52:50] come out on those sacred Sands Brother
[52:52] David no Theologian now I want you to go
[52:55] back and study the message what brother
[52:56] Bram said he said the devil cannot step
[52:59] on those sacred
[53:00] Sands he cannot step on those sacred
[53:03] Sands I want you to watch what he saying
[53:05] he's saying no Theologian go back and
[53:06] look what he says no Theologian no
[53:09] doctor no psychologist no devil he he
[53:13] lumps theologies psychologies Devils
[53:16] every one of them he said if you ever
[53:18] get in that sacred sand they will never
[53:21] explain it away now who's trying to
[53:23] explain away the Holy Ghost it's the
[53:25] devil and he's doing it the theologians
[53:28] and psychologists and every kind of
[53:30] teacher and they're trying to explain
[53:32] that way and brother Ram said what
[53:33] they're doing is it's their unbelief
[53:36] it's their unbelief and they're making
[53:37] an excuse for their unbelief and they're
[53:40] bypassing the Holy Ghost amen but it's a
[53:42] sacred sand tonight amen that you can
[53:45] come to a place that nobody can explain
[53:47] that away from
[53:51] you
[53:54] nobody I think we pray God tonight
