[14:04] 37 the first verse this was a time that
[14:07] the kingdom has been
[14:09] depleted through the years of captivity
[14:12] and once blessed and prosperous nation
[14:15] was walking around in a place of dryness
[14:17] brother
[14:18] Wayne and the first verse says the hand
[14:20] of the Lord was upon me and carried me
[14:23] out in the spirit of the Lord and set me
[14:25] down in the midst of the valley which
[14:27] was full of Bones
[14:30] and he calls me a pass by them round
[14:32] about and behold there were very many in
[14:35] the open Valley and L they were very
[14:39] dry looked like an impossible situation
[14:43] to the world it was
[14:45] hopeless and he's inviting Ezekiel take
[14:48] a look let me take you on a
[14:50] trip let me show you the impossible
[14:54] situation have you ever been there amen
[14:58] and but I say tonight that nothing is
[15:00] impossible to my God he may be 4 days
[15:04] late but he's always on
[15:06] time Lazarus was in a bad
[15:10] situation amen he was he was dead in a
[15:13] grave somewhere death clo was upon Him
[15:16] amen the skin was taken over his body
[15:19] but then Jesus came by the voice of
[15:22] Resurrection came walking by amen
[15:25] something begin to
[15:26] happen and he said unto me son of man
[15:29] can these bones live and I answered oh
[15:32] Lord God thou
[15:34] knowest
[15:36] Lazarus come
[15:38] forth Lazarus couldn't escape the
[15:41] blessing Aben skin wors had to give
[15:45] away loose him and let him go there was
[15:49] Freedom there was Liberty at the sound
[15:53] of the voice of
[15:55] Resurrection Hallelujah this world may
[15:58] be given up on
[16:00] you churches may have given up on you

[16:06] you maybe your family has given up on
[16:09] you amen but I got good news to you

[16:14] my God can never lose anything he's a
[16:17] god of restoration he's a god of
[16:21] restoring it's a promise I will restore
[16:25] my God can't lose
[16:27] anything yes sir when there was a law
[16:30] when in the Garden of Eden amen when it
[16:33] looked like all hoes were gone but in
[16:35] the back parts of God's mind there was
[16:37] something screaming out I'll put
[16:40] everything screaming out I'm going to
[16:42] restore I'm going to bring
[16:46] back Hallelujah and I believe he's done
[16:49] it we're just living in the fruits of
[16:53] it we're living in an age not just
[16:56] coming out but going in
[16:59] right
[17:01] amen he's a god of
[17:04] restoration and again he said un me
[17:06] prophesy upon these bones and say to him
[17:09] oh you dry bones hear the word of the
[17:13] Lord hear the word of the Lord Faith
[17:15] cometh by hearing hearing the word you
[17:20] may seem dry it may seem hopeless may
[17:24] just look like dry bones or some but God
[17:27] is looking Beyond the circumstances and
[17:30] he sees the
[17:32] potentials Hallelujah that's my God
[17:36] tonight we may look and see failure
[17:40] brother John we may see and look look
[17:43] hopeless hey we as Believers could go
[17:46] through a time
[17:48] where we're searching we're missing
[17:51] seems like something's
[17:54] missing it's maybe a dried time of your
[17:57] life
[17:59] and we might look in the mirror as our
[18:01] worst enemy and think what a failure I
[18:05] am what a guy that falls short and falls
[18:08] on his
[18:10] back but God's looking down from the
[18:13] heavens and he sees the potentials of
[18:16] some dry bones down in the valley it
[18:19] made it look hopeless to Ezekiel it
[18:21] might it look hopeless to the land but
[18:23] God knew the potentials that was laying
[18:26] down there the bones were scattered out
[18:28] throughout the valley but God is a god
[18:31] of restoring God is a god of
[18:34] restoration he's a God to restored back
[18:38] what people has given up
[18:42] on my boy I could preach there for a
[18:46] [Music]
[18:47] moment thus sayith the Lord God unto
[18:50] these bones behold I will cause breath
[18:53] to enter into you and you shall live you
[18:56] should be quickened amen message of Hope
[19:00] and I will lay Sinners upon you I will
[19:03] give you the ability to become what you
[19:06] once
[19:07] was there a Revival fixing to take
[19:12] place amen so he prophesied I commanded
[19:16] and I prophesied there was a noise and
[19:20] behold there was shaking bones were
[19:22] scattered abroad because of
[19:25] time because of something that happened
[19:28] in time amen but couldn't keep God's
[19:32] purpose to come in the past there was
[19:36] bones scattered everywhere but didn't

[20:08] them you know this age that we're living
[20:11] in no doubt the blindness and
[20:13] nakedness

[28:02] simply gone by in time and no longer in
[28:06] existence are we living in that Liberty
[28:09] tonight amen are we living under the
[28:11] freedom of the message of the
[28:13] [Applause]
[28:16] hour amen we're
[28:19] not set free in a n like for ex for
[28:23] illustration tonight brother Wayne if I
[28:26] was in prison for something not done
[28:30] and maybe they they sentenced me to to
[28:32] life in
[28:33] prison without
[28:35] parole maybe they throw the book at me
[28:39] and in my mind I'm thinking I'm going to
[28:41] get out of
[28:42] here I'm going to I'm going to set
[28:45] myself
[28:46] free and maybe as you you know we've
[28:48] heard the stories is maybe got to pick
[28:51] and begin to pick my way out amen it
[28:53] might have took days months years but
[28:56] one day I pick my way outside of the
[29:00] Prison Walls and the and the prison cell
[29:04] and and the bondage of
[29:08] prison but you know what it followed me
[29:11] everywhere I
[29:13] went that
[29:15] chain that ball chain following
[29:18] me because I
[29:20] escaped that's fear follow me you try to
[29:24] change your
[29:25] identity amen your name is over every
[29:29] Television over every radio over every
[29:32] buletin
[29:33] board amen amen there's always fear
[29:37] fallowing your life and and there's
[29:39] always a fear you know why because the
[29:42] courts hadn't gave you the Seal of the
[29:46] approval amen so the law has the ability
[29:49] to take you
[29:52] back oh glory amen I can think of the
[29:56] time amen when Moses as a one man
[29:58] invasion was going down to take over
[30:00] Egypt he went down he tortured Pharaoh
[30:03] he said let my people go he didn't go
[30:06] down to compromise with him he didn't go
[30:09] down to say you can keep this por with
[30:11] no I'm not going to leave a hood
[30:15] behind to a place brother R said he said
[30:18] Moses why don't you get all you got and
[30:21] get out of here that's right that's
[30:25] right and no doubt there was many that
[30:28] try to escape but Pharaoh had the
[30:31] ability to go and bring them right
[30:33] back but this time it was
[30:36] different that's right God be to pull
[30:39] him out in the exodus by a mighty hand
[30:42] of Jehovah and when the enemy was coming
[30:45] in like a flood God lifted up a standard
[30:48] against
[30:49] them that's right and all night long
[30:53] brother Zach Aben God kept the enemy at
[30:56] Bay and at the rising of the sun there
[31:00] was came a wind of Yahweh out of the
[31:02] heavens and begin to divide the
[31:06] sea dry to ground and God's people
[31:11] couldn't escape the blessing they begin
[31:14] to walk over on dry
[31:16] ground and when they got to the other
[31:18] side when the last one reached the other
[31:21] side God allowed the enemy to come in
[31:24] but this blessing wasn't designed for
[31:26] them that's right the very road that led
[31:30] to their Deliverance is going to lead to
[31:32] their
[31:37] destruction hallelujah hallelujah and I
[31:39] can imagine as God looked down on the
[31:41] pill of fire with Angry Eyes and came
[31:44] down and took the chariot wheels off and
[31:46] they read them in the ground and the
[31:49] wind of Yahweh came and
[31:51] ceased and the waters came to destroy
[31:54] their
[31:55] enemy and maram and grabbed the
[31:58] tambourine and begin to dance in the
[32:01] spirit as I looked back and seen their
[32:04] enemy was dead church this was a
[32:06] different response this was a different
[32:09] song this this was a different
[32:12] dance they was not
[32:15] escapes they was free free
[32:18] indeed and that's the way we are church
[32:21] tonight we're no longer
[32:24] escapes we can't go back we don't have
[32:28] the ability to go
[32:30] back who the son has made free is free
[32:36] indeed hallelujah how many's free
[32:41] tonight
[32:47] hallelujah what a freedom
[32:49] dance but Jonathan who was
[32:52] different how many sung that
[32:55] song how how many danced that day
[32:58] Dan how many screamed that
[33:01] scream because why amen you tried many
[33:05] times just exonerate yourself you come
[33:08] to alar you said you said that this time
[33:10] a going to change and you go right back
[33:12] to the
[33:13] old the elements of this
[33:16] world but one
[33:18] day I say one day Mercy came walking by
[33:22] your
[33:23] way it was a predestinated moment of
[33:27] time
[33:28] well this time you couldn't escape the
[33:34] blessing Hallelujah
[33:39] hallu he says brother B says who the son
[33:42] has made free is free

[33:47] bondage no looking over your

[34:52] of him brother Brown said they failed to
[34:54] realize there was a brazing serpent
[34:57] there was already atonement that was in
[35:01] effect when God looked down aen he
[35:04] couldn't see only thing he could see
[35:06] amen was the sacrifice the
[35:09] atonement and they look down as white as
[35:12] snow oh Hallelujah that's my God Amen
[35:15] when they tried to curse God's children
[35:17] only thing they could do is bless them

[35:24] blessing Hallelujah
[35:30] I had to skip some of this God's good
[35:32] isn't
[35:34] he numbers 23 and 21 says he has not
[35:38] beheld the iniquity of Jacob neither has
[35:40] seen the perverseness of Israel the Lord
[35:43] is God is with him and the shout of the
[35:45] king is among them the shout being a
[35:48] jubilant Sound by which the presence of
[35:51] the Lord as their King is among them
[35:55] there's a shout of the king a message
[35:58] that has gone forward he said we have
[36:01] obtained an
[36:02] inheritance somebody has to leave you
[36:05] something God before the foundation of
[36:08] the world left you

[36:20] right he said it was name was written on
[36:24] the book that when the L would be slain

[36:53] wheel and he seal
[36:55] it to the de of the testator yes that's
[37:00] right and the only one has the ability
[37:02] to break the seal is the executive of
[37:06] his
[37:07] will and when it comes
[37:09] time after the death of my
[37:13] father the executive would take the
[37:16] wheel and he would break it and he would
[37:20] be begin to uh
[37:24] notify he would begin the summons
[37:28] [Music]

[37:37] phone call from the executive my
[37:40] father's will neither would I yours

[56:40] to go talk them into it Church all she
[56:42] had to do is go and collect the blessing

[58:39] verdict Hallelujah that man was born
[58:41] blind amen Jesus came by and spit on the
[58:45] ground and placed some bud cakes upon
[58:47] his eyes yeah and told him to go down
[58:50] and wash he he he by by Nature he
[58:54] shouldn't be able to see by science
[58:56] there's no way he'd ever see then Jesus
[58:59] came

[59:06] the pool and begins to wash and mud
[59:09] begins to wash off his face and they
[59:12] came and ask him I know the story I wish
[59:14] I could preach it tonight but he says
[59:16] they came condemning him he said I don't
[59:18] know what y'all's talking about is true

[59:45] Glory this ain't a fair deal this is
[59:48] restoration time this is resurrection
[59:52] time this is overcoming time this is
[59:56] Rapture
[59:57] time there's no way we should be able to
[59:59] take a Rapture of body change that's our
[1:00:02] diagnosis but a verdict through the
[1:00:05] message of the hour notified us we are
[1:00:09] bound to
[1:00:12] arrive we've already we've been notified
[1:00:16] we've already turned
[1:00:18] Heavenly and it's promise the musicians
[1:00:21] will come his promises are yes
[1:00:26] amen yes can I be healed yes and amen
[1:00:31] can I have Deliverance yes and
[1:00:35] amen he can do it
[1:00:38] tonight
[1:00:43] that's I was diagnosed that I I would
[1:00:46] always have serious problems with my
[1:00:49] right
[1:00:50] ear I lived 48 years like that
[1:00:56] wow but in our Tent Revival brother John
[1:01:00] de Martin was preaching the Lord began
[1:01:02] to deal with me on the front
[1:01:06] row the jonan I was having trouble it
[1:01:09] got worse because if I can give this
[1:01:11] testimony as
[1:01:13] closing it got where I had three Re
[1:01:16] bones replacing this ear and and they
[1:01:18] replaced it and it doesn't drain by
[1:01:19] itself so I had to go twice a year but
[1:01:21] now it's got where it would drop in
[1:01:23] between my eardrum and caus just just
[1:01:26] pouncing of noises just nearly driving
[1:01:29] me crazy at night laying down and it was
[1:01:32] just getting worse and I had to go to
[1:01:33] the doctor a lot more don't have
[1:01:34] insurance and going to a specialist and
[1:01:37] I was sitting right there and Jonathan
[1:01:38] Martin was preaching the message of the
[1:01:40] hour I again this is my time this is my
[1:01:43] opportunity the Lord dealt with my heart
[1:01:45] I came up at brother Jonathan laid hands
[1:01:46] on me Brother David sire put his hands
[1:01:48] on my ears I'm here to tell you I have
[1:01:51] not had that sound in my ear since
[1:01:53] October of last year my d Jes said one
[1:01:56] thing but my verdict said I'm the Lord
[1:01:59] God that healing all that diseas us he's
[1:02:02] the same God tonight if you've been
[1:02:05] dealing with something God says your
[1:02:08] verdict is you had it from the first
[1:02:11] place he gave your inheritance there and
[1:02:15] he brought Jesus to make it real to
[1:02:18] [Applause]
[1:02:20] you and Satan can't hold the land
[1:02:24] forever that's I believe this is my
[1:02:26] interpretation brother Wayne that's the
[1:02:28] reason why he sealed it there he gave it
[1:02:31] to us there he he put our profile on
[1:02:34] file there and nothing in time could
[1:02:38] ever change what happened in
[1:02:41] eternity how many's thankful for the
[1:02:43] message of the hour this world don't
[1:02:45] know those things but you're blessed
[1:02:48] because you got a messenger and you have
[1:02:50] ears to
