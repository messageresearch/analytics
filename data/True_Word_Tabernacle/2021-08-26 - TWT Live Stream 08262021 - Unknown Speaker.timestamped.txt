[43:19] chapter 3
[43:21] and we'll read from the first verse
[43:25] you just have to forgive me i preached
[43:26] for brother uh jonathan
[43:29] a few months back and
[43:32] i was preaching out of acts chapter two
[43:35] that was a few months ago
[43:36] i'm just now getting acts 3 i guess so
[43:40] amen
[43:42] we'll start at the first verse
[43:44] now peter and john went up together into
[43:47] the temple
[43:48] at the hour of prayer
[43:50] being the ninth hour
[43:52] and a certain man laying from his
[43:53] mother's womb was carried
[43:55] and they lay daily at the gate of the
[43:57] temple which is called beautiful to ask
[44:00] alms of them that enter into the temple
[44:03] who's seeing peter and john about to go
[44:05] into the temple ask and alms and peter
[44:08] fastening his eyes upon him with john
[44:11] said look on us
[44:13] and he gave heat under them expecting to
[44:15] receive something of them then peter
[44:17] said silver and gold have i none
[44:20] but such as i have give i thee in the
[44:23] name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up
[44:25] and walk
[44:26] and he took him by the right hand and
[44:28] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[44:31] and ankle bones received strength
[44:33] and he leaping up stood and walked and
[44:36] entered with them into the temple
[44:38] walking
[44:39] and leaping
[44:40] and praising god
[44:43] and all the people saw him walking and
[44:45] praising god may the lord just had his
[44:48] blessings tonight and
[44:49] you can have your seats
[45:01] back home i've been going through a
[45:03] series on the book of acts and on
[45:05] wednesday night and
[45:07] so um
[45:08] i i'm just gonna if it's all right with
[45:11] you all i'm just gonna make myself at
[45:13] home here tonight
[45:15] amen i i believe that we're a book of
[45:17] acts church
[45:18] amen i believe the prophet said that if
[45:20] that original vine ever put forth
[45:22] another branch
[45:24] he said they'd write a book of acts
[45:25] behind it
[45:26] amen he also said he said that christ in
[45:30] the true church is a continuation of the
[45:33] book of acts
[45:34] you believe that
[45:36] amen even satan knows this he knows that
[45:39] the original church at pentecost with
[45:41] the power of god brother brown said mark
[45:44] 16 in action
[45:45] is the church that jesus claims as his
[45:48] own
[45:50] all others are faults
[45:53] amen all other churches are false amen
[45:55] so the church that jesus christ claims
[45:57] as his own is the church that has the
[46:00] power of pentecost in it
[46:03] as a power amen of the word in that
[46:05] church amen mark 16 in acts and signs
[46:08] and wonders following the church and i
[46:11] believe that amen this bride is a is a
[46:14] bride that's got the power of the holy
[46:16] spirit in her
[46:17] amen i believe that she's a living bride
[46:20] that i believe that it's more than just
[46:23] intellect it's more than just a an
[46:25] intellectual understanding or a
[46:27] conception
[46:28] of the word but but i believe that is
[46:30] the power of god being made manifest
[46:33] brother brown said amen i'll just kind
[46:36] of delay a little foundation for the
[46:38] thought tonight and by the way i'm going
[46:39] to speak to you tonight on such as i
[46:42] have such as i have there's very
[46:44] important because amen you can't give
[46:46] something to somebody else if you ain't
[46:48] got it
[46:50] amen you notice amen when peter and john
[46:52] went to the gate called beautiful amen
[46:54] they could only offer the man there what
[46:57] they had
[46:58] amen such as i have give i thee in the
[47:01] name of jesus christ and i believe
[47:03] that's why we need some men of god in
[47:04] the pulpit that's got the baptism of the
[47:06] holy ghost
[47:08] amen i believe that we need some
[47:09] preachers that's got a revelation of
[47:11] this message amen because how can you
[47:14] preach something that you've never
[47:16] experienced or how can you give it to
[47:18] somebody else if you ain't got it
[47:21] amen i thank god for some men like ray
[47:23] erickson and amen some andrew glovers
[47:25] and wayne lawsons and even jonathan
[47:28] martin's brothers even all you other
[47:29] brothers here tonight amen amen the
[47:31] reason why you can preach amen this
[47:34] message and the power that you preach it
[47:36] is because you've experienced the god of
[47:38] this message
[47:40] hallelujah and the reason you can preach
[47:43] and experience with christ is because
[47:45] you've had an experience with christ
[47:48] hallelujah amen such as i have give i
[47:51] thee now notice this brother brown and
[47:54] i'm i'm just going to lay a foundation
[47:56] i'm not going to hold you alone but i i
[47:58] might preach a little bit if that's all
[48:00] right but the prophet said in the
[48:01] message of acts of the holy spirit he
[48:03] says he said right off they went
[48:05] speaking of uh the apostles there after
[48:08] the day of pentecost said right off they
[48:09] went just as hard as they could go
[48:11] preaching the gospel peter and john two
[48:14] ignorant unlearned men passed through
[48:16] the gate called beautiful
[48:18] amen the devil said well now if they're
[48:20] just out there preaching it won't hurt
[48:21] anything
[48:22] but when they pass through the gate
[48:24] called beautiful and they're laid a man
[48:26] and the holy ghost said peter that man
[48:28] can be healed
[48:30] he's got faith
[48:32] amen i like how brother brown said that
[48:34] he said the holy ghost spoke to peter
[48:36] and said now peter that man can be
[48:39] healed
[48:40] in other words there's something in that
[48:42] man
[48:42] that can receive what you offer him
[48:46] amen amen there's something in him and
[48:48] and and so brother brown said there's
[48:50] something he said he's got faith
[48:52] amen he says when he perceived that he
[48:54] had faith to be healed he said stand up
[48:56] on your feet and he picked him up held
[48:58] him up till his ankle bones received
[48:59] strength and away he went leaping and
[49:02] jumping and praising god and you know
[49:04] what that caused more trouble than all
[49:07] the preaching they ever did
[49:10] brother you just let something on the
[49:12] phenomenal side start
[49:14] and watch how every rogue held in hell
[49:17] will go hollering at it
[49:19] craving blood is that true i tell you
[49:21] peter preached a sermon on the day of
[49:23] pentecost 3 000 souls were saved and the
[49:26] devil never even moved out of his bed
[49:29] that's right they said oh well just let
[49:31] him alone see but when he passed through
[49:33] the gate beautiful even the next day and
[49:35] healed a man that big crippled from his
[49:37] mother's wound all hell turned loose on
[49:41] that's right amen they throw them in
[49:43] jail kept them there overnight yes sir
[49:45] put them in prison amen because the
[49:47] phenomenal see the devil said i can't
[49:49] let this thing get started now amen i
[49:52] can't let divine healing now if we do
[49:54] it'll really knock my props out from
[49:56] under me that's right because i might
[49:58] fool around with them a little bit on
[50:00] theology every now and then
[50:02] amen but i sure can't fool the real
[50:04] thing
[50:05] that comes out of people when they see
[50:08] that it's done
[50:10] hallelujah so the devil said i got to
[50:13] stop this before it ever gets started
[50:15] amen but i love what the prophet said he
[50:17] said but he never stopped it then
[50:20] and he can't stop it now
[50:23] hallelujah that's right
[50:25] god's gospel will move on
[50:27] it'll move on and on and on
[50:30] amen when there's no more heaven and
[50:32] there's no more earth the word shall
[50:35] never pass away
[50:38] hallelujah amen that word is just as
[50:41] immortal as god himself it can't pass
[50:43] away and i believe every word of it all
[50:46] things that jesus was he is now and
[50:49] always will be
[50:51] that's right he's the same yesterday
[50:53] today and forever
[50:57] and the same holy ghost
[50:59] amen this is your prophet the same holy
[51:01] ghost
[51:02] that fell on the day of pentecost it's
[51:05] the same holy ghost today
[51:07] i'll admit it's been trampled on it's
[51:09] been made fun of it's been
[51:11] misrepresented amen everything else like
[51:14] that amen but that's only the devil
[51:16] counterfeiting amen but there is a real
[51:20] genuine baptism of the holy spirit that
[51:23] will bring the result the same results
[51:26] they had on the day of pentecost
[51:30] how many of you can say amen
[51:33] hallelujah amen i believe this tonight
[51:36] if we preach what paul preached we'll
[51:38] get the same results paul got hallelujah
[51:42] even and if we preach what william
[51:44] branham preached we'll get the same
[51:46] results that we i'm random god
[51:53] hallelujah
[51:54] the devil couldn't stop it then he can't
[51:56] stop it now
[51:59] amen but when the phenomenon starts
[52:01] moving
[52:02] amen when amen when lies begin to be
[52:05] touched and changed
[52:07] amen when it moves beyond just good
[52:09] sermons preached and just an intellect
[52:12] amen or puts them close together and it
[52:14] starts amen actually touching hearts and
[52:17] changing lives and the sick is being
[52:20] healed and people's getting the holy
[52:22] ghost and you're having means like you
[52:24] just come out of brother that'll turn
[52:26] hell upside down it'll stir the devil up
[52:32] hallelujah
[52:34] i'll tell you this and i i'm sure y'all
[52:36] already know
[52:37] amen you got the devil mad and he's
[52:39] doing everything he can amen to destroy
[52:41] the effects of that meeting already
[52:44] come on he'll do everything he can to
[52:46] put it put something on it or this
[52:48] happen and that happened or somebody win
[52:51] got a little fanatic or whatever it is
[52:53] he'll fight it every way he can amen but
[52:56] i tell you what amen i'm glad even after
[52:59] we have a good meeting
[53:01] i'm glad that we can stir the devil up
[53:03] so much
[53:06] listen church i'd hate to think that we
[53:08] could have a camp meeting and he'll not
[53:11] recognize it i'd hate to thank amen that
[53:14] we could have church and the devil ain't
[53:16] bothered by it
[53:18] i'm glad we got the devil mad tonight
[53:22] hallelujah and i tell you this the only
[53:25] thing it does is exposes him
[53:30] come on church
[53:32] amen you have a good meeting amen
[53:34] everything will go wrong
[53:36] a few days after the meet everything
[53:38] goes wrong
[53:39] amen you think man
[53:41] we just come out of a good meeting the
[53:43] next thing you know amen there's a
[53:45] disagreement over here and a problem
[53:47] over there and even for a long time i
[53:49] couldn't understand that and i always
[53:51] thought it was so negative even but then
[53:53] i began to realize as a result of that
[53:55] meeting
[53:57] and all them devils was in my church
[53:59] anyhow but they was hiding there and i
[54:02] didn't know where they were
[54:04] [Applause]
[54:05] but when the spirit of god got to moving
[54:09] them devils started raising up their
[54:11] heads
[54:12] and they thought they were going to stop
[54:14] it but all they did is lifted up their
[54:16] head long enough amen that we knew where
[54:19] they were that we could take the sword
[54:21] of the word
[54:22] and cut their head off
[54:25] [Applause]
[54:30] hallelujah
[54:32] well praise god maybe
[54:35] amen maybe the atmosphere is still
[54:36] moving on over amen i feel good in here
[54:39] tonight
[54:42] hallelujah
[54:43] amen paul said in first corinthians 2 1
[54:46] he said i brethren when i came to you
[54:48] came not with excellency of speech or of
[54:50] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[54:52] of god
[54:53] amen for i determined not to know
[54:56] anything among you save jesus christ and
[54:58] him crucified
[55:00] and i was with you in weakness and in
[55:02] fear and much trembling and my speech
[55:04] and my preaching was not with enticing
[55:06] words of man's wisdom but in the
[55:08] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[55:12] that your faith should not stand in the
[55:15] wisdom of men
[55:16] but in the power of god
[55:20] first thessalonians 1 and 5 for our
[55:22] gospel came not unto you in word only
[55:26] but also in power
[55:28] and in the holy ghost
[55:30] and in much assurance
[55:32] amen as you know what manner of men we
[55:34] were among you for your sake
[55:36] brother brown said in the god of this
[55:38] evil age 1965 he said god never ordained
[55:41] us to go have schools
[55:43] he never told us to build hospitals
[55:46] they're good
[55:47] he never told us to build libraries no
[55:49] sir amen he said preach
[55:52] the gospel
[55:55] and the gospel is manifesting
[55:58] it's demonstrating the power of the holy
[56:01] spirit
[56:03] amen the faith that was once delivered
[56:05] to the saints
[56:06] he said these things that i do show you
[56:08] do also
[56:09] even more than this shall you do for i
[56:11] go to the father go you into all the
[56:12] world amen the last great commission to
[56:15] every minister go ye into all the world
[56:17] and preach the gospel
[56:20] what is the gospel you say it's the word
[56:22] not only
[56:23] amen paul said the gospel came not
[56:25] through the word only but through the
[56:27] power and manifestation of the word by
[56:29] the holy ghost
[56:30] to teach the word like reading the
[56:32] newspapers cc brother brown starts
[56:34] talking about he said when he went over
[56:35] to india
[56:37] amen them men amen told him when he was
[56:39] coming he said they said brother branham
[56:42] amen we we don't need somebody to come
[56:44] teach us theology
[56:47] amen they said because the bible's an
[56:49] eastern book and we're in eastern people
[56:52] and we probably know more theology amen
[56:54] than most of you americans
[56:57] he said amen they said we don't need
[56:58] somebody come over here and teach us
[57:00] theology what we're looking for is
[57:02] somebody that can make that bible live
[57:07] amen what we're looking for is somebody
[57:09] even not to teach us more theology amen
[57:12] but amen but show us and prove to us
[57:15] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[57:18] today and forever
[57:21] i believe they got the right man
[57:25] he didn't go over there and take a bunch
[57:26] of theology amen he went over there and
[57:29] showed them the resurrected jesus christ
[57:33] hallelujah amen i'm not ashamed to
[57:35] follow this message nor the messenger
[57:37] amen you say well he made a lot of
[57:39] mistakes and he misquoted the scripture
[57:41] here and he he said 700 when it should
[57:43] have been 7 000 and all this kind of
[57:45] stuff even but he he told us himself he
[57:48] said i might not know the book very well
[57:51] but i know the author of the book
[57:54] hallelujah and i tell you this tonight
[57:57] amen to know him is life
[58:01] it's got to go beyond memorizing
[58:04] scriptures
[58:07] putting some quotes together things like
[58:09] that they're wonderful amen and i
[58:11] believe that if you love god you'll love
[58:13] his word don't misunderstand what i'm
[58:15] saying tonight amen god is his word
[58:18] and hearing the word are one
[58:20] you can't love jesus and not love his
[58:22] word
[58:24] amen but to know him is not to know a
[58:26] doctrine
[58:31] amen you've got to know him amen in the
[58:34] power of his resurrection
[58:40] the prophet said these are familiar
[58:41] things but
[58:43] amen i know i'm preaching in a church
[58:45] tonight that y'all believe in quoting a
[58:47] prophet so
[58:48] i feel at home amen
[58:50] amen the prophet god hates a powerless
[58:52] religion
[58:54] i believe we ought to hate what god
[58:56] hates
[58:56] and love what he loves
[58:59] if god hates iniquity and spirit we
[59:01] ought to hate it too
[59:02] and if he hates a religion they ain't
[59:04] got no power in it i believe we ought to
[59:06] hate it too
[59:07] ain't no wonder this world is so sick of
[59:09] religion you can't even blame them
[59:12] friends
[59:13] i'm sick of religion
[59:16] you know why they're sick of religion
[59:18] it's because they saw someone as fake
[59:21] and they they met so many people amen
[59:23] that claim to know christ and quote the
[59:25] bible and live like devils
[59:29] come on church amen but the prophet of
[59:31] god said god hates a powerless religion
[59:35] it's got to have power in it
[59:38] it takes a power to save a man
[59:43] hallelujah amen it's it's a power that
[59:46] can do signs and wonders and miracles
[59:48] even that jesus christ promised amen
[59:51] when they zeroed in on the word of god
[59:52] back there and believed it it hit the
[59:54] target you zero and on the same word of
[59:56] god it will hit the target again it's
[59:59] got to because he's the same yesterday
[1:00:01] today and forever
[1:00:04] hallelujah
[1:00:06] brother brown said god wants to perform
[1:00:08] his word
[1:00:10] and even in this same quote brother
[1:00:12] brown says god wants to show himself
[1:00:15] alive
[1:00:18] amen he said he wants to work through
[1:00:20] his church
[1:00:23] hallelujah amen
[1:00:25] you know a lot of times we we you know
[1:00:28] uh come to church and and it's as if we
[1:00:32] you know are trying to
[1:00:34] uh you know uh uh
[1:00:37] make god move or you know uh
[1:00:40] it's like you know we're we're coming to
[1:00:42] the idea that we need to beg god to do
[1:00:44] something when the prophet is saying
[1:00:46] actually he's wanting to do it
[1:00:52] he's just looking for somebody that's
[1:00:54] willing to get out of his way
[1:00:57] and let him do it
[1:01:02] he wants to work in his church
[1:01:05] brother brown says
[1:01:07] saint john
[1:01:08] 14 12 the works that i do shall you do
[1:01:10] also
[1:01:11] greater this right go the fight he said
[1:01:13] the church tries to deny that
[1:01:16] he said but it's still the truth

[1:09:09] and that woman got up off of that cot
[1:09:12] and started walking
[1:09:17] hallelujah
[1:09:19] to prove to us
[1:09:21] that the god of the bible is still the
[1:09:24] same
[1:09:25] hallelujah and what god did he still
[1:09:29] does

[1:09:51] and notice this and he took him by
[1:09:54] the right hand

[1:09:59] because a man didn't have
[1:10:01] the strength to stand up on his own
[1:10:04] amen but peter even spoke to him and
[1:10:07] then he took him by the by the hand and

[1:10:19] amen but but it took peter actually
[1:10:22] reaching down and lifting him up
[1:10:25] and i was just reading that just to be
[1:10:26] honest with you i didn't even preach
[1:10:27] this at my own church i was just reading
[1:10:29] it today and it just come to me even
[1:10:31] though i was singing about brother
[1:10:32] branham was telling that testimony
[1:10:35] about being in africa
[1:10:37] and any any they led this this boy up
[1:10:41] onto the platform with a chain you
[1:10:42] remember you remember the story and even
[1:10:45] under the testimony and they led this
[1:10:46] this this young man up onto the platform
[1:10:49] with a chain and he was walking like an

[1:11:23] brother brown said when he even when he
[1:11:25] spoke to the interpreter the boy
[1:11:27] couldn't even understand what he was
[1:11:29] saying because he had no mental capacity
[1:11:31] to do it
[1:11:33] amen the boy couldn't even speak he
[1:11:34] couldn't even even but yet brother brown
[1:11:36] said amen in his heart
[1:11:40] amen listen church you a person can be
[1:11:43] completely and totally insane and out of
[1:11:46] their mind
[1:11:47] and yet have the holy ghost

[1:12:18] mind because you let a thought pass
[1:12:21] through that you shouldn't have but i
[1:12:23] want to say something to the devil
[1:12:24] tonight you might have got in my mind a
[1:12:27] few times but you didn't get in my heart
[1:12:32] hallelujah
[1:12:33] because god reserved that place
[1:12:38] for himself

[1:12:50] the vision broke
[1:12:52] and brother branham seen a a boy and he
[1:12:55] he said either riding a

[1:24:53] and the bible said he was filled with
[1:24:54] the holy ghost
[1:24:56] when they began to question him down
[1:24:58] amen and say about whose authority by
[1:25:00] what power and whose name did you do
[1:25:02] these things amen peter looked right at
[1:25:04] him and he said you rulers are the
[1:25:06] people and elders of israel amen he
[1:25:08] wasn't ashamed of christ he wasn't
[1:25:09] ashamed to be identified with christ and
[1:25:12] brother if you ever get the holy ghost

[1:25:29] friends amen you'll not be ashamed to be
[1:25:32] identified with that acts 238 screaming

[1:25:39] miserable creatures that the world calls
[1:25:42] us
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:46] is for the holy ghost
[1:25:50] he said being known unto all of you and
[1:25:52] all the people of israel but that by the
[1:25:54] name of jesus christ
[1:25:57] whom you crucified
[1:25:59] whom god raised from the dead even by
[1:26:01] him does this man stand here whole
[1:26:03] before you
[1:26:05] this is a stone
[1:26:07] that was setting out of your of you
[1:26:08] builders
[1:26:10] which has become the head of the corner
[1:26:12] neither is there salvation
[1:26:15] in any
[1:26:16] other
[1:26:18] for there is none other name under
[1:26:20] heaven given among men whereby we must
[1:26:24] be saved
[1:26:25] how many can say amen to that tonight
[1:26:29] amen there ain't no name i'll come on i
[1:26:31] just want to say something to you
[1:26:32] tonight amen when jesus tread the wine
[1:26:35] press of the wrath of god he did it all
[1:26:37] by himself and there wasn't no pope
[1:26:40] standing with him come on friends when
[1:26:41] he paid for your salvation amen there
[1:26:44] was no prophet beside him there was no
[1:26:46] preacher standing there amen it's christ
[1:26:49] and christ alone
[1:26:59] brother
[1:27:00] when they saw the boldness of peter and
[1:27:02] john they perceived that they were
[1:27:04] unlearned and ignorant men
[1:27:09] amen couldn't even sign their own name
[1:27:11] brother brown said
[1:27:13] but they knew they'd been with jesus
[1:27:16] brother brown said how it's kind of
[1:27:18] people we need he said that's the kind
[1:27:19] of church that we need
[1:27:22] even that people would have to take note
[1:27:25] that we've been with jesus
[1:27:32] and beholding the bible in verse 14 says
[1:27:35] about this is acts 4 14 and beholding a
[1:27:37] man which was healed standing with them
[1:27:39] they could say nothing
[1:27:41] against it
[1:27:44] when they commanded them to go aside out
[1:27:46] of the council they conferred among
[1:27:47] themselves saying what shall we do these
[1:27:48] men for indeed a notable miracle have
[1:27:51] been done
[1:27:52] and it's been manifest to all them to
[1:27:53] dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it
[1:27:56] amen you know why they couldn't deny it
[1:27:58] because a man had been healed
[1:28:00] was too close by
[1:28:05] i'm on where where was uh where was all
[1:28:07] these critics writing all these books
[1:28:09] and building all these websites when
[1:28:10] brother branham was here
[1:28:15] why didn't they stand up in the meetings
[1:28:16] and say oh no that ain't how that
[1:28:18] happened in finland or amen why didn't
[1:28:20] they stand up when he was standing there
[1:28:21] giving the testimony of congressman
[1:28:23] upshaw and how the lord had healed him
[1:28:25] he'd been lame for 66 years in a
[1:28:27] wheelchair amen couldn't walk a
[1:28:29] for 66 years amen and brother brown
[1:28:31] standing up there giving the testimony
[1:28:33] and nobody stood up and said no i didn't
[1:28:35] how it happened amen a matter of fact
[1:28:37] the man that was healed amen in some
[1:28:39] cases was in the meeting
[1:28:43] one time he walked across the platform
[1:28:46] one time he says on tape amen that
[1:28:48] congressman upshaw interrupts brother
[1:28:50] branham
[1:28:53] come on church amen they could not deny
[1:28:56] that what the man was saying was the
[1:28:57] truth because the man that was healed
[1:29:00] was standing too close by
[1:29:06] you know why the devil could can't come
[1:29:08] in archer in this church and convince
[1:29:10] y'all amen that the message ain't real
[1:29:12] and that brother ben was a false prophet
[1:29:15] i want to tell you why
[1:29:16] the person that was healed is too close
[1:29:19] by
[1:29:20] it's too many witnesses
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:24] i said there's too many witnesses
[1:29:27] definitely gonna come in here tonight
[1:29:29] and tell us this message don't work
[1:29:33] definitely gonna come here tonight and
[1:29:34] tell us that god don't heal the sick no
[1:29:36] more that god don't feel with the holy
[1:29:39] ghost that god they'll still save and
[1:29:41] change hearts and lies even there's too
[1:29:43] many people standing close by
[1:29:46] that has done happen too
[1:29:51] hallelujah
[1:29:53] you know why the devil can't tell me
[1:29:55] that this message is fake
[1:29:58] he come too late
[1:30:02] because i'm like the boy in john 9.
[1:30:06] when they come to question and say amen
[1:30:08] who's this man and how'd he do this and
[1:30:10] why did he do this and how this happened
[1:30:11] he said look y'all ought to know all
[1:30:13] that amen amen you mean to tell me god
[1:30:16] sent a man like this amen you've studied
[1:30:18] the scrolls back and forth you don't
[1:30:19] know who he is amen but i don't know
[1:30:21] about all your questions
[1:30:25] i'm going to let the pressure off
[1:30:26] tonight listen to me young people and
[1:30:28] old people whoever can hear my voice or
[1:30:30] not even let the pressure off in this
[1:30:32] area you're not responsible to answer
[1:30:35] all their questions
[1:30:41] you're not responsible to prove that 16
[1:30:43] million fell off a bridge you're not
[1:30:46] responsible even to prove where brother
[1:30:48] brennan was when the cloud picture was
[1:30:50] taken amen you are responsible to
[1:30:53] believe the message of the hour that god
[1:30:56] has delivered unto you
[1:30:59] and i might not can answer all their
[1:31:01] questions but there's one thing i know
[1:31:03] for sure i once was blind
[1:31:06] but now i see you
[1:31:08] hallelujah and i know what this message
[1:31:11] has done for me it changed my life
[1:31:16] hallelujah it's changed my children
[1:31:25] the man that's healed too close
[1:31:30] it really limits what the devil can do
[1:31:34] they said we can't deny this has
[1:31:36] happened
[1:31:37] so you know what they've done they got
[1:31:38] them on their sales and they said i'm
[1:31:40] gonna close
[1:31:42] but they got among themselves and they
[1:31:43] said
[1:31:44] they said all right we can't we can't we
[1:31:46] can't stop him we can't deny thing they
[1:31:48] said so what they've done is they
[1:31:49] threatened them
[1:31:51] and they said
[1:31:52] don't go and
[1:31:54] go ahead and y'all go we're going to let
[1:31:56] you go but y'all behave yourselves
[1:32:03] y'all want to have few street means go
[1:32:05] ahead
[1:32:06] but just don't preach in the name of
[1:32:07] jesus
[1:32:10] come on friends amen don't you know that
[1:32:12] same old spirit's still around
[1:32:15] go ahead and preach just don't quote the
[1:32:17] prophet
[1:32:21] go ahead go ahead and have church but
[1:32:23] amen just you know keep it keep it uh
[1:32:25] formal and and keep everything under
[1:32:27] control now and even y'all go ahead and
[1:32:29] oh come on now
[1:32:32] and if it ain't from that side it's
[1:32:33] coming from the other side and they say
[1:32:35] amen you know really you don't need to
[1:32:36] preach no more just play tapes
[1:32:38] and i'm being careful in these areas i'm
[1:32:40] not trying to attack nobody amen but i'm
[1:32:43] just telling you this i feel like paul
[1:32:44] tonight amen paul said he said well unto
[1:32:47] me if i don't preach
[1:32:50] paul said i'm not doing this because i
[1:32:52] wanted to do it
[1:32:54] come on church i'm not doing this
[1:32:56] brother brown even said amen against my
[1:32:58] own better judgment if he had what he
[1:33:00] wanted he wanted to go out in the
[1:33:01] wilderness and be a trapper
[1:33:04] he wasn't preaching amen because he
[1:33:06] wanted to it was by necessity
[1:33:09] is that what paul said he said i preach
[1:33:11] a necessity and woe is unto me if i
[1:33:14] preach not
[1:33:18] let me encourage every preacher in this
[1:33:20] building this ain't the time to stop
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:25] this ain't the time to lay our bibles
[1:33:27] down
[1:33:28] this is not the time to quit quoting a
[1:33:30] prophet this is not the time to back up
[1:33:33] on our revelation this is not the time
[1:33:35] amen to compromise on the word this
[1:33:38] ain't the time to lower the standards
[1:33:39] this ain't a time to give in to the
[1:33:41] pressure this is the time to draw your
[1:33:43] sword and march forward
[1:33:46] and preach like you've never preached
[1:33:48] before
[1:33:52] hallelujah
[1:33:54] it's your commission
[1:34:00] preach the
[1:34:02] gospel me let me let me just let you in
[1:34:05] on something tonight
[1:34:06] to preach the gospel is not a style
[1:34:14] see people like me you know we get up
[1:34:16] and scream and holler and spit and
[1:34:19] people call that preaching and and it is
[1:34:22] amen but but preaching
[1:34:24] is more than a style
[1:34:28] because there's people that that do all
[1:34:30] that but it's just a bunch of
[1:34:31] pentecostal showmanship
[1:34:35] you hear what i'm saying it's not it's
[1:34:37] just amen uh charisma
[1:34:39] amen and they you know they got away and
[1:34:41] they've got a gift and all that kind of
[1:34:43] stuff amen preaching the gospel is when
[1:34:45] there's a power of demonstration that
[1:34:47] comes behind what you're saying
[1:34:51] amen a man could just stand behind the
[1:34:53] pulpit and and just speak words amen
[1:34:56] amen and be preaching the gospel it is
[1:34:59] not a style it's what's behind it
[1:35:05] hallelujah
[1:35:07] amen if there's something behind it amen
[1:35:10] that's what matters
[1:35:19] let me close mercy
[1:35:21] you guys forgive me
[1:35:24] but
[1:35:26] they told me and said don't preach no
[1:35:27] more
[1:35:30] in the name of jesus don't you you go
[1:35:32] and
[1:35:33] have church and
[1:35:34] you know have some gatherings and
[1:35:36] have some meetings whatever you do don't
[1:35:38] preach no more in the name of jesus
[1:35:42] and under that pressure
[1:35:44] you know they could have come under the
[1:35:46] idea which brother brown said many will
[1:35:47] fall into this trap in the end time that
[1:35:50] they'll begin to say
[1:35:51] it'd be better to serve god
[1:35:53] under that than not serve them at all
[1:35:56] so they cave into the pressure
[1:35:59] even they
[1:36:00] you know you understand what i'm saying
[1:36:02] even though they'll move into the world
[1:36:04] council of churches caving to the
[1:36:05] pressure of the of the hour even
[1:36:08] thinking that it'd be better to to serve
[1:36:10] god under that than not serve him at all
[1:36:13] but peter and john in them
[1:36:15] they were of a different breed
[1:36:19] and when the pressure come down and they
[1:36:21] said don't preach no more in the name of
[1:36:22] jesus
[1:36:23] peter and john said
[1:36:26] well the only thing is this
[1:36:28] they said
[1:36:29] shall we obey man
[1:36:31] or shall we obey god
[1:36:35] amen
[1:36:37] shall we obey man or shall we obey god
[1:36:40] amen and they made their decision right
[1:36:42] there
[1:36:43] amen we're going to obey god
[1:36:47] whatever pressure comes whatever
[1:36:48] pressure goes we're going to preach
[1:36:50] jesus christ
[1:36:52] in the power of his resurrection
[1:36:54] amen the bible said they let them go
[1:36:56] they went back and among their own
[1:36:57] people and they began to have a meeting
[1:36:59] and they began to tell them all the
[1:37:00] things that were done and said amen as
[1:37:02] they were saying that amen the bible
[1:37:04] says they all begin to pray with one
[1:37:06] accord
[1:37:08] amen they begin to quote the scripture
[1:37:10] amen of david when the heathen raged and
[1:37:12] all the amen they began to quote the
[1:37:14] scripture and even
[1:37:15] and as they began to pray even just to
[1:37:17] get to the end point now amen my bible
[1:37:20] says amen that the the holy spirit even
[1:37:24] the they were all filled with the holy
[1:37:27] ghost
[1:37:29] and the bible said even the house shook
[1:37:34] where they were
[1:37:35] the house began to shake amen and
[1:37:37] brother benham takes that and shows he
[1:37:39] said listen he said this was only a few
[1:37:42] days after they got the holy ghost
[1:37:44] even a few days later the same people
[1:37:47] that got the holy ghost and acts 2 had
[1:37:50] an axe for conference
[1:37:55] amen and it was under a great hour of
[1:37:58] persecution and pressure coming from
[1:38:00] every side even but under that pressure
[1:38:03] they begin to pray amen they begin to
[1:38:06] turn their face toward god and they
[1:38:08] begin to quote the word and the bible
[1:38:10] says and they were all filled with the
[1:38:12] holy ghost brother brown said in other
[1:38:14] words they were refilled with the holy
[1:38:16] ghost
[1:38:19] hallelujah amen and he said that's the
[1:38:22] problem we got we got a bunch of people
[1:38:24] trying to live off of yesterday's
[1:38:26] experience
[1:38:28] come on church he said you can't do it
[1:38:31] amen and some of you he may say man we
[1:38:34] had a good time in no meetings but
[1:38:36] tonight's another night you say but it
[1:38:38] wasn't just a few days ago amen but we
[1:38:41] could have an axe
[1:38:43] conference right here tonight
[1:38:47] and those of you
[1:38:49] that got the holy ghost can be refilled
[1:38:52] with the holy ghost
[1:38:54] and those of you that were refilled with
[1:38:56] the holy ghost can get another refilling
[1:38:59] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:05] hallelujah
[1:39:07] can i just quote it the way the prophet
[1:39:08] said baptism after baptism

[1:43:54] you know i i know and all the things
[1:43:56] going on in the world we're living in
[1:43:57] and it seems like everywhere you look
[1:43:59] it's just trouble on every side and
[1:44:02] you know and
[1:44:04] just
[1:44:05] darkness all around but
[1:44:07] let me just encourage you tonight
[1:44:10] it's always real dark
[1:44:12] right before deliverance
[1:44:17] darkest hour israel had in egypt it was
[1:44:20] right before they left in an exodus
[1:44:27] i was just
[1:44:28] studying the other day and trying to you
[1:44:29] know just praying because you know a lot
[1:44:31] of times we we pray and as men of god
[1:44:34] and these these brothers will testify
[1:44:36] this
[1:44:36] you know you're not just looking for
[1:44:38] something to preach
[1:44:40] you're looking for the inspiration of
[1:44:41] the holy spirit something that would
[1:44:43] encourage your people and give strength
[1:44:47] and you know i was just
[1:44:49] looking at my congregation and we've
[1:44:51] been going through some stuff and
[1:44:53] you know all this
[1:44:55] things with the virus and different
[1:44:56] things going on and
[1:44:58] you can just look and the people just
[1:44:59] look tired
[1:45:01] they just looked tired
[1:45:03] they're real believers and they love god
[1:45:04] but they just
[1:45:06] you just feel it you know
[1:45:08] i got reading over there and judges i
[1:45:10] got to read about gideon
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:14] how god gave him a great victory and all
[1:45:16] the i was just reading through it and i
[1:45:18] kept on reading over there and brother
[1:45:20] ray the bible says
[1:45:22] that when the enemy began to flee
[1:45:26] gideon is 300 men begin to pursue
[1:45:29] there's one verse of scripture there in
[1:45:31] particular that just stood out to me
[1:45:33] because it said
[1:45:34] getting those 300 men crossing the
[1:45:36] jordan and said faint
[1:45:39] yet
[1:45:40] pursuing
[1:45:45] they was tired but they were still
[1:45:46] chasing
[1:45:50] i got so encouraged by that
[1:45:52] and i thought man that's if i ain't a
[1:45:54] picture of where i'm standing at
[1:45:58] i went to my church i said listen church
[1:46:00] we might be faint
[1:46:02] but we're still pursuing
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:08] we might be tired
[1:46:12] and listen
[1:46:14] there's a difference in being faint
[1:46:16] and faint of heart
[1:46:19] because them men were retired but did
[1:46:22] none of them talk about turning back
[1:46:25] none of them was ready to quit
[1:46:28] what none of them protested saying now
[1:46:30] it's time for somebody to come take my
[1:46:31] place i've done my part i've done i've
[1:46:33] done fault as far as i can fight now
[1:46:35] it's time for somebody to come and give
[1:46:36] me some relief here no they were
[1:46:38] determined to press forward
[1:46:42] they marched slow
[1:46:43] but they marched
[1:46:47] they might not have been quite as fast
[1:46:49] as they once was but they were still
[1:46:50] going
[1:46:53] and you know what the holy spirit began
[1:46:55] to speak to me you know why they were
[1:46:57] wore out brother andrew
[1:46:59] they wasn't wore out because they was
[1:47:00] losing a battle
[1:47:03] they were actually wore out because they
[1:47:05] were winning the battle
[1:47:07] [Music]
[1:47:10] they were not tired
[1:47:12] because they had been pushed into a
[1:47:14] corner
[1:47:15] they were actually wore out because they
[1:47:17] had chased their enemy across mountains
[1:47:20] valleys rivers
[1:47:24] hallelujah
[1:47:26] listen church don't be weary and well
[1:47:27] doing tonight
[1:47:29] amen and if you're tired it ain't
[1:47:31] because the devils beat you up it's
[1:47:33] cause you got a lot of blood on your
[1:47:35] sword

[1:47:39] and there's a lot of people that have
[1:47:41] turned and walked away
[1:47:43] but you're still here
[1:47:47] you're still here tonight
[1:47:50] faith that you're pursuing
[1:47:52] and we ain't gonna quit
[1:47:54] until our children are saved and they

[1:48:00] person is healed

[2:00:24] lord line upon line and precept upon
[2:00:27] precept may that holy ghost that is
