TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] is the philistines never come yet looking good cause the pity the philistines demand part no i was reading these rules just this morning i could not find anywhere that we are to give a portion of our success to anyone except through sacrifices really yes i am an israelite by birth jehovah promises that israelites have possessed the gates of their enemies right we are all israelites we have that promise from long ago but how does that help us now that means that we don't have to let the philistines keep defeating us and leaving us absolutely we can defeat the philistines if we believe the promises i don't know shannon that sounds awfully risky but why should we continue to live below our privileges if a promise is there we just have to claim it and live it i still think it's best to keep the philistines happy and not question it it's my right to claim what i have word for why should i let the enemy just come and take it i'm tired of getting into their every demand many will just forget about us this year that way we don't have to worry about causing the scene i dare you by this time every other year they've been here to take what they want i'm sure they'll be coming any day now [Music] do [Music] here [Music] what [Music] what's going on you call for a special assembly with the soldiers tonight sir what time is it almost 1800 hours sir what song [Music] this year sir right now [Music] cup of coffee left left right left i don't know what i've been told left right left left left left right left i don't know but i've been told i don't know what i've been taught [Music] [Music] [Music] me left left left right left left left left right left halt sir sir are the soldiers oh they've arrived oh [Music] great job so far you brought in not until they brought in no matter you've run into wrecking your own [Music] [Applause] [Music] remember his name [Applause] [Music] i think he's my favorite [Music] general since this will be so easy how about giving some of the soldiers a break seeing as how hard we have workers i'm listening shanghai is always so willing i think 600 soldiers tomorrow [Applause] [Music] so blessed and lose and we'll still get more than enough i am sure shangri will thank you for your wonderful generosity yeah he does all the work and we get all the food it's perfect i'm captain you're gonna lead your soldiers at daybreak sir yes sir dismissed army attention army left face mark time mark time left up left left left right left burn march left left left right left left left left right left i'm your captain you're our captain you are my soldiers where are your soldiers i'm your captain you're [Applause] [Applause] soldiers [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh huh [Music] i see any clowns oh my well i suppose you can get everything ready for that let's get ready children nothing has changed last year's demands are you mad keep working children of course they won't budge we know does anyone never try well no not that i know exactly please don't do anything foolish we don't want to cause any trouble i don't want trouble i just want lunch to do besides i'm a jew i never people christ for anything [Music] uh [Music] army attention army mark time mark time left up left left left right left burn march left left left right left we are the philippines we are the philistines the mighty party everywhere we go everywhere we go [Music] no we really just take them [Music] left left right left left left left right left left left left right left good foot shanghai we're here for our portion of your crops very well how much do you require this year usual actually the general has decided that since you've been our best donor over the years without complaint that we leave you 25 well that is very generous of the general king split what have you seen my family we really survived this year ocean guard can't you just be happy with what they have decided to leave trust me [Music] absolutely not why not okay how about you take 16 leave me 40. that way i have plenty for my family and you still have one for your truth sharing what has gotten into you this morning what do you mean nothing has gone into me how about 70. [Laughter] [Music] no [Music] never before have you asked about your requirements you have always been such a willing and helpful donor i just think the requirements are steve [Music] the general is being generous as it is we take 75 and leave you with a very generous 25 that is the general's orders and that is final take it away troops no no by law doesn't say that i have to give any portion to you this is mine and if you want it you'll have to kill me for it [Music] mercy over here no no this way no you cannot it was rightfully mine take this catch if you can come on can't you do any better you're home help me i cannot find this man in the world as if you're jumping to stop me from killing you [Music] [Music] [Music] we are trained just give up right now perhaps with the lord all things are possible i'm not giving up out of life what sorcery is this okay that's enough little shampoo and leaving i've had enough with this madness let's go before he kills us too soon you used to be the most gentle man i've ever known yet today you have turned into a killer i don't understand this is my redemptive right my jehovah i will keep it [Music] chamber what have you used to kill my regiment power of the lord is with me shame guard you don't have to please please don't kill don't kill me i won't scare you i will kill my enemies and keep them with your helmet as promised unto [Applause] me

the great success they have today it was disastrous what i said louisiana no shiva was our best daughter why would you destroy him general sir i don't think you understand what's going on here sir canvar destroyed our army how many lost just a few casualties no sir twenty surely not more more sir fifty having one ninety fifty of my trained soldiers higher a hundred out with it haven't shared your kill oh he killed them all all 600 how i'm sure there's a logical explanation for this but how is this logically possible he said he had the power of the lord with him and this power doesn't destroy the entire unit yes sir it was the strangest thing he don't need to touch them and they fell dead what did he touch them some poison no sir it was just when all the oxycodes chamber killed 600 of my trained soldiers with a stick unbelievable totally illogical yes sir i know sir had i not been there i would have trouble believing it was possible sir i have heard of the god of israel his mighty power well today was a definite demonstration of his power to think that our best gender newspapers destroyed the entire day i'm so [Music] laughs [Music] why is there no noise oh jehovah help me be strong oh my they're all dead how can this be in our crops they're untouched what can this mean shergar what have you done chambar how are they all dead and yet you alive i have no idea well

stick yes i have no idea how i can't explain it at all i can't explain what what exactly happened here okay i truly don't know what happened all i know is that when i started moving they started falling didn't stop until they were all down ocean whatever possessed you i just kept remembering what i read in the scrolls about my rights and i knew i couldn't get in one more time imagine you can come out on children it's safe imagine can we keep our entire yield for this year jehovah be praised yes taking jehovah for his word claiming what is ours surely our god is a living god [Applause]
