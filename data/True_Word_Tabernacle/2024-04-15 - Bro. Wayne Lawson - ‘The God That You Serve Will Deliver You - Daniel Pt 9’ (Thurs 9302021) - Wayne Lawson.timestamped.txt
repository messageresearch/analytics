[3:47] into the Book of
[3:49] Daniel and we're going to be thank you
[3:51] brother we look into the Book of Daniel
[3:53] and we're going to look in the sixth
[3:54] chapter
[3:58] here
[4:03] and we want to look here in the 10th
[4:05] verse Daniel 6
[4:08] and10 now when Daniel
[4:10] knew the writing was
[4:13] signed he went into the
[4:15] house and his window being open in the
[4:18] chamber toward
[4:20] Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees
[4:23] three times a day and
[4:26] prayed and gave thanks before his God
[4:30] as he did a four time amen God bless you
[4:33] you may be seated
[4:35] tonight I've been speaking a little bit
[4:37] from The Book of Daniel and I uh just
[4:40] felt to continue tonight if that's okay
[4:42] with you
[4:43] all there has been a few things that has
[4:45] been outstanding to me and uh to for me
[4:48] the Book of Daniel has always been an
[4:50] outstanding book and as long as I can
[4:53] remember uh these stories of the Hebrew
[4:56] children and of Daniel and the Lion's
[4:58] Den have been uh things that
[5:01] significantly stuck out in my memory
[5:03] even from a little child uh I I don't
[5:06] remember a lot about the doctrine uh
[5:08] when I was a little boy we grew up in
[5:09] church but till we was about 9 years old
[5:12] mostly what I remembered was Sunday
[5:14] school so we say God bless you Sunday
[5:16] school teachers uh thank you I do
[5:19] remember the men preaching from the
[5:21] platform and they got I remember them
[5:23] was they was pretty loud and some of
[5:25] them were sweaty and things but I
[5:26] remember one thing that was always
[5:28] significant to me as they talked about
[5:30] them uh Shadrach mesach and abedo and I
[5:32] never could pronounce them but I liked
[5:35] what God did for them and and it was
[5:37] amazing to me that God would let people
[5:39] get in a fire and he'd save them in the
[5:40] middle of the fire and then one of the
[5:42] other outstanding stories to me was the
[5:44] story of Daniel the Lion's Den I always
[5:47] thought that was amazing and then when I
[5:49] got a little older and I started reading
[5:51] it and I realized it wasn't Daniel on
[5:52] the Lion's Den it was Daniel and The Den
[5:54] of Lions it wasn't just a lion's den
[5:56] because a lion's den don't mean there's
[5:58] lions in it but he was in a Den of Lions
[6:01] I mean there was was lions in there and
[6:03] he was put in among live uh animals and
[6:06] and so tonight I just want to take a few
[6:08] minutes and to talk about the story of
[6:10] Daniel and uh and how that Daniel is
[6:14] showing a resolve uh to live for God and
[6:17] he's showing a resolve that he has
[6:19] purposed within his heart to not be
[6:21] defiled by Babylon to not be changed by
[6:24] their rules or by their laws but he has
[6:27] determined that he will remain true to
[6:29] God even to the taking of his own life
[6:33] now in Daniel the first chapter we read
[6:35] how that they uh the Bible said they had
[6:37] purposed in their heart and they
[6:39] wouldn't eat the king's meat they
[6:40] wouldn't defile themselves with the wine
[6:43] and then we found that God uh actually
[6:45] exalted them in the time of
[6:47] Nebuchadnezzar through the mystery and
[6:49] how that when the mystery was unfolded
[6:51] and then Daniel was able to discern the
[6:53] mystery which raised him above his
[6:55] Brethren and then we find of course then
[6:58] the Hebrew children uh denied to worship
[7:01] another God and they were thrown in the
[7:03] flames of fire and God delivered them
[7:05] and then we see that even through the
[7:07] years that seemed like Daniel almost
[7:09] began to get forgotten for a little
[7:10] while until in Daniel 5 when you see
[7:13] that the handwriting come on the wall
[7:15] and again David become or Daniel becomes
[7:17] a focus there in Babylon and they bring
[7:20] him out to be able to read the
[7:21] inscriptions and now this ability of
[7:24] Daniel to read the inscriptions on the
[7:26] wall is what's made him famous in the
[7:28] land of Babylon it's made him a famous
[7:30] man because he can understand and
[7:33] discern things that other people cannot
[7:35] understand his prophecies were exactly
[7:37] true the things that he said concerning
[7:39] the dream of Nebuchadnezzar and the
[7:41] things which he had said of elazar has
[7:43] just happened amen and he has just saw
[7:46] the changing of a government from
[7:49] Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar and Bel chazar
[7:52] Babylon is just changed under the meian
[7:54] Persians and they're now living under
[7:56] the rule of Darius the king of of the
[7:59] mes amen and this is about I think about
[8:02] a year before Sirius begins to rule as a
[8:04] Persian and you're and you're you're
[8:06] reading here of how that Daniel uh has
[8:10] been elevated in the Kingdom he has
[8:13] become third in rule can you imagine a
[8:16] Hebrew child who is captive who is not
[8:19] Babylonian not Persian not Meade he
[8:22] believes in one God and has been defiant
[8:25] in that belief and now he has been
[8:27] elevated to the third house highest
[8:30] power of the realm can you imagine now
[8:32] all the people and all the politics and
[8:34] all the working behind the scenes and
[8:37] all the people who were doing favors and
[8:39] petting one another on the back and
[8:41] secretly whispering but God was
[8:43] elevating this man and the Bible said he
[8:46] did it because he had an excellent
[8:48] spirit in him isn't it amazing how the
[8:51] spirit of a man will either promote him
[8:53] or demote him amen it was just we just
[8:56] read how be shazar was amen was killed
[8:59] that very night because that he had
[9:02] exalted himself in Pride just like his
[9:04] grandfather Nebuchadnezzar and we saw
[9:06] that he went into the Wilderness seven
[9:08] years what was a a great man was put to
[9:11] a low man because that his Spirit had
[9:14] become hoty and pridey but now we're
[9:17] reading about a man who is an humble man
[9:20] who is actually excellent in spirit and
[9:23] this man has been exalted to the third
[9:25] highest in the realm amen because of
[9:28] this now in Daniel chapter six we'll
[9:29] read just a little bit if it's okay the
[9:32] Bible said it Darius set over the
[9:34] kingdom 120 princes which should be over
[9:37] the whole Kingdom and over the three
[9:39] presidents of whom Daniel was first the
[9:42] princes might have accounts unto them
[9:45] and the King should have no
[9:47] damage then Daniel was preferred above
[9:50] the presidents and the princes because
[9:53] of an excellent Spirit within him see
[9:56] Daniel was preferred because he went
[9:57] around and he was really nice to
[9:59] everyone and and he and he done favors
[10:01] and he was political and he had this on
[10:03] that guy and he had this on that guy and
[10:06] he was twisting arms and Mak it a way
[10:08] for himself that's not what the Bible
[10:10] reads here amen uh uh brother bandam
[10:13] tells us something powerful he says
[10:15] God's gifts make room for themselves
[10:18] amen Daniel didn't have to go around
[10:20] there and work the sides and the
[10:23] quarters to find his position he didn't
[10:25] have to wrestle with anyone the King was
[10:28] exalted exting him because of the spirit
[10:31] that was found in him and look at this
[10:33] the scripture said an excellent Spirit
[10:36] was in him and the King thought to set
[10:38] him over the whole real this man is a
[10:41] whole lot like the man Joseph when you
[10:43] read the book of Genesis and there's
[10:44] about 13 chapters in The Book of Genesis
[10:47] that is given to the man Joseph and
[10:49] remember when God shows that Joseph is
[10:51] going to rule it was his own Brethren
[10:54] that become jealousy and out of jealousy
[10:56] see it was the core jealousy was the
[10:58] core of the problem they had with Joseph
[11:01] and there's a a tape if you like a a
[11:03] tape listener there's called Joseph
[11:05] meeting his Brethren and brother bam
[11:07] explains that it was their Brethren that
[11:09] Saul and Joseph the Covenant and it was
[11:12] the devil that got on them that had
[11:14] heard God prophesy from The Book of
[11:17] Genesis there in the garden when he said
[11:19] that uh the woman's seed he said shall
[11:21] have enmity with the Serpent's Seed and
[11:24] he shall bruise his head now when the
[11:26] scripture says that the devil went to
[11:28] looking for that seed for that very
[11:29] moment and the moment that Joseph be to
[11:32] get a vision of rulership Amen it was
[11:35] then his Brethren turned against him
[11:36] brother man said really what it was it
[11:38] was the devil trying to kill that seed
[11:40] out before it stomped him down see he
[11:42] was trying to get it while it was in
[11:44] Joseph but we see that Joseph was a son
[11:46] of prosperity I think it's a powerful
[11:49] thing tonight to understand Joseph was a
[11:51] son of prosperity and it did not matter
[11:54] what they did to Joseph he rose anyhow
[11:57] it didn't matter how critical it didn't
[11:59] matter the situation amen his own
[12:01] Brethren sold him into slavery amen they
[12:04] put him in a pit and he rose above he
[12:06] put in Piper's house and he became the
[12:09] chief in Piper's house they lied on him
[12:11] throw him in prison and the prison
[12:13] guards gave him rule over the whole
[12:16] prison amen from that place he was taken
[12:18] and put next to the throne of pharaoh
[12:21] himself so in Pharaoh's Egypt he was
[12:23] lifted amen it was not his political
[12:26] ability that was placing him there it
[12:29] was was the spirit that Joseph had amen
[12:31] it was the spirit of Christ it was an
[12:34] excellent spirit amen I I know that
[12:36] sounds Mighty abstract from where you're
[12:38] sitting here tonight but let me let me
[12:40] say something to you a prophet does us a
[12:43] favor and ties some scriptures together
[12:45] and he said you are all sons of
[12:47] prosperity amen if you're a child of God
[12:50] you are a child of prosperity the Bible
[12:53] said he that has been born of the spirit
[12:55] he is the Seed of Abraham according to
[12:57] the promises of ABR
[12:59] and according to Genesis the 12th
[13:01] chapter out of Abraham would come Kings
[13:04] is that right and so there are spiritual
[13:06] kings that are placed in the last day
[13:09] who are being exalted amen no matter the
[13:12] situation you were born no matter the
[13:14] problems of your life no matter the
[13:16] situations of the inheritance of of your
[13:18] uh uh physical abilities wherever you
[13:22] were placed you were still rising to the
[13:25] place that God calls you to be and
[13:27] listen amen I know that devil is going
[13:29] to do so many things against you there's
[13:32] going to be so many things thrown at you
[13:34] as a Believer amen but my Bible says in
[13:37] Romans the 8th chapter he says to amen
[13:40] that God will make everything turn out
[13:43] for your good all things work together
[13:46] for the good of them that are called of
[13:49] God according to his purpose amen do you
[13:52] believe that and if God before us who
[13:55] can be against us they in all things we
[13:58] are more more than conquerors in Christ
[14:01] amen who has led us are you hearing me
[14:03] tonight amen the devil can stack
[14:06] anything he wants to on the church but
[14:08] she's going to rise up anyhow it will
[14:11] only become a stepping stone for the
[14:14] Church of the Living God because we have
[14:16] been anointed to rise up in the age that
[14:18] we're living in Joseph is your type
[14:21] Daniel is your type amen God was
[14:25] exalting then the Bible said Heath
[14:27] highly exalted Jesus Christ
[14:29] is it is what the Bible said he highly
[14:32] exalted him amen do you know that you
[14:35] were positioned in Christ and wherever
[14:37] he is there is where the Church of the
[14:39] Living God is amen exalted and risen up
[14:44] in Christ Jesus now it's a powerful
[14:47] thing because you can see that the Lord
[14:49] Jesus of course is the picture here
[14:52] because Jesus amen was a perfect man
[14:56] with a perfect spirit and they crucified
[14:58] him
[15:00] him come on now he was crucified and
[15:04] they Bible says clearly they found no
[15:06] fault in
[15:08] him and Daniel is being is being
[15:12] persecuted but they can't find any fault
[15:16] so Daniel's fault is not the place of
[15:20] his
[15:21] persecution the persecution comes from
[15:24] the core of jealousy of people against
[15:27] people whom God blesses
[15:30] whenever God blesses you there will be a
[15:33] persecution against you whenever God
[15:37] blesses a church there will be a
[15:39] persecution against that church whenever
[15:41] God blesses you you let amen you let
[15:43] somebody get a blessing in the church
[15:45] and dance down the aisle amen there'll
[15:47] be a persecution spiritual natural amen
[15:50] every kind of situation because it's the
[15:53] devil's job to persecute the believer
[15:56] and he can't find nothing wrong with him
[15:58] he he that's an excellent Spirit the
[16:00] Bible judged and said that Jesus was a
[16:03] perfect man now Heen now the scriptures
[16:06] tells us here amen I I'll tell you the
[16:08] fourth verse is powerful then the
[16:10] presidents amen and then the presidents
[16:13] and the princes sought to find occasion
[16:17] against Daniel concerning the kingdom
[16:20] but they could not find no occasion or
[16:22] fault for as much as he was faithful
[16:24] neither was there any error of Faith
[16:26] found in him and then they said we shall
[16:29] not find any occasion against Daniel
[16:32] except we find it against him concerning
[16:34] the law of his God so the only thing
[16:37] they could do to get it Daniel was to
[16:40] catch him serving his God now that he
[16:42] was guilty of now he was guilty of being
[16:45] a worshipper he was a guilty man of
[16:48] being someone who sought the face of the
[16:50] almighty he was guilty of prayer he was
[16:53] guilty of love he was guilty you see
[16:56] that's what he was guilty of was serving
[16:58] God amen I asked some people here while
[17:00] back I I I I I looked over in the
[17:02] scripture where Jesus said for what good
[17:04] do Works what good works do you Stone me
[17:06] for after all amen and I I wonder
[17:09] sometimes even with the prophet of the
[17:11] age what what good works are they
[17:12] stoning brother bandam for what what
[17:14] good thing that he did that they're mad
[17:16] about it in this age amen amen he done
[17:19] so many good things and seems like so
[17:21] many are upset about it amen but you see
[17:24] you can't really find any fault in him
[17:26] even his critics will say the man was
[17:28] ever wrong on his discernment even the
[17:31] critics will say not in all of the of
[17:34] the Ministries in the world have we ever
[17:35] seen more healings or more miracles amen
[17:38] than what we saw there so they can't
[17:40] find any fault in it so they they have
[17:43] to find the fault in the way that he
[17:44] serves God now notice this Heen those
[17:48] presidents and those princes assembled
[17:50] together the king and they said unto the
[17:52] king now Darius live forever and now
[17:55] they go to they go to using their
[17:57] politics here and they pump up the the
[17:59] king and the presidents of the Kingdom
[18:00] the governors and the prince and the
[18:02] counselors and all the captains have
[18:04] counseled together to make a fierce
[18:06] decree or firm decree and whosoever
[18:08] shall make a petition of any God or any
[18:10] man for 30 days say thee Old King he
[18:13] shall be cast into the Den of Lions
[18:14] isn't it amazing that they're going to
[18:16] make a law that makes the king a god
[18:19] under the people and nobody can seek a
[18:22] god unless they seek King darus now
[18:24] darus plays right into the hands of the
[18:26] political will they greased the wheel
[18:30] they stroke the ego they knew exactly
[18:33] what would get the attention of that
[18:34] King let's just build him up a little
[18:36] bit make him important and then he'll
[18:38] sway our Direction amen they knew human
[18:41] nature quite well now Old King
[18:43] established the decree and sign the
[18:45] writing that it be not changed and and
[18:48] add to the law of Moses the law of mes
[18:50] and the Persians which alterthe the king
[18:53] darus signed the writing and the decree
[18:56] now the law of Mees and Persians were a
[18:58] law that could not be changed that's a
[19:00] that's a direct that's a direct place
[19:01] here in the scripture you'll also find
[19:03] it in the Book of Esther amen that they
[19:05] couldn't change the law of the meet in
[19:07] the Persian now they made a law whether
[19:10] you couldn't pray for 30 days couldn't
[19:12] petition to any God now Daniel was a man
[19:14] who petitioned his God constantly three
[19:17] times a day amen and the Bible tells us
[19:20] that David was an UNC or Daniel was an
[19:22] uncompromising man I I think this is a
[19:25] Christian character I think there's a
[19:26] houseful of Daniels sitting here today
[19:29] amen there is an uncompromising spirit
[19:31] in him in other words amen he knew that
[19:34] they had made a law against
[19:36] praying they made a law against it and
[19:39] this man was so
[19:41] uncompromising that he even even denied
[19:45] the idea of shutting the curtains so
[19:48] nobody could see him praying but he
[19:50] literally went into his house as he had
[19:52] every other day and he draw back the
[19:54] curtains and knelt down and begin to
[19:56] pray now here's the thing Daniel knew
[19:59] Daniel knew that when he began to pray
[20:02] that he was going to contact God he knew
[20:04] that it was his communication to God
[20:06] Amen now I don't have time to preach
[20:08] tonight on prayer but I'll say this to
[20:10] you it's the most powerful weapon
[20:12] putting in the hands of a Believer amen
[20:15] there's a lot of times you can't do
[20:16] nothing about some of the situations
[20:18] there times where you can't counsel
[20:20] there's times when the situations just
[20:22] seem like there's no hope amen that's
[20:25] when you begin to pray and when the
[20:27] people of God begin to pray God makes a
[20:30] way where there is no way prayer will
[20:33] make a way for that to happen so when
[20:35] Daniel begins to pray he knows he's
[20:37] connecting with God but he's angering
[20:40] the mob against him he's actually
[20:42] breaking the laws of the land against
[20:45] him now I want you to think about this
[20:47] when they part those when they part
[20:49] those curtains and he turns to look out
[20:51] that window the Bible specifically says
[20:54] that he looks unto
[20:55] Jerusalem now there's a reason this man
[20:58] is praying with an open window toward
[21:00] Jerusalem is he's saying there's nothing
[21:03] going to hinder my prayer I'm not going
[21:05] to let a law I'm not going to let any
[21:07] kind of cloud nothing's going to hinder
[21:10] prayer and he turns to the window begins
[21:12] to pray now out that window somewhere
[21:15] far out there is the city of Jerusalem
[21:17] which is actually at that moment is in
[21:20] destruction and the temple of God is not
[21:22] even standing there but Daniel remembers
[21:26] the promise in the book of Kings
[21:29] when Solomon dedicated the Temple of the
[21:31] Lord he made a prayer un the temple and
[21:34] said Lord If thy people ever at any time
[21:38] get in trouble no matter where they are
[21:40] no matter if they've been cast out of
[21:42] thy sight Lord let them turn and look
[21:45] unto thy Temple and if they will look to
[21:47] thy Temple and pray that you will answer
[21:50] their prayer and deliver them now Daniel
[21:53] is a man that knew about the prayer of
[21:55] Solomon and that Temple wasn't there at
[21:58] that moment he could not see it with his
[22:00] eyes but he knew that that had been a
[22:03] promise from God that he would deliver a
[22:05] man who would look out that window and
[22:08] pray towards that Temple now I wonder
[22:10] how he was so sure have you ever read
[22:12] the Book of Jonah when Jonah was in the
[22:14] belly of a whale and he was in a place
[22:17] an Inc compromisable position he was
[22:19] between belly of a of a whale and he was
[22:23] in the bottom of an ocean it was
[22:25] impossible for Jonah to get out of the
[22:27] belly of that well but the Bible tells
[22:29] us that Jonah begin to give the vow of
[22:32] Thanksgiving and he began to pray in the
[22:34] belly what I've often wondered how did
[22:36] Jonah even know which way to look how
[22:39] did he know which way the East was amen
[22:41] we serve the kind of God that if a man
[22:45] determines to pray and he wants to pray
[22:48] right God will show him the right
[22:50] direction he will give him a help in the
[22:52] time of trouble and turning the right
[22:54] way that he would know how to pray my
[22:57] Bible says that God will give us
[22:59] utterance and the spirit will give us
[23:01] help that we might know how to pray amen
[23:04] Jonah found out amen that God delivers
[23:07] even when you're in the belly of a well
[23:10] Jonah found out that God is able to take
[23:13] a a man and deliver him out of any
[23:15] situation amen and here Daniel is
[23:18] praying the same kind of prayer he's not
[23:21] in the belly of a well but he's between
[23:23] a rock and a hard place he's between the
[23:25] law that says he cannot worship His God
[23:29] and a law that commands him to worship
[23:31] His God and he decided he would rather
[23:34] go into a den of lines than to go in the
[23:37] pits of hell he would rather walk into a
[23:40] den of lines than to face an Angry God
[23:43] he would rather face the penalties of
[23:46] man than whatever they could do to him
[23:48] in the human realm in other words he
[23:50] knew that I'm not going to fear a man
[23:53] who can destroy my body I fear a God who
[23:56] can destroy my soul his fear was not of
[24:00] the world his fear was of God the Bible
[24:03] said the beginning of all wisdom is the
[24:07] fear of God it's the fear that God would
[24:10] be disappointed with a man amen and see
[24:12] him differently amen when I think about
[24:15] this tonight I think about this Daniel
[24:17] that made this decision I don't have
[24:19] time to labor here on Daniel's
[24:22] Constitution we've we've labored a bit
[24:25] before but I will say this point he had
[24:27] an attit ude he would not give an inch
[24:30] of
[24:31] ground he had the attitude I'm not going
[24:34] to give an inch of ground and I think
[24:37] that there ought to be some Believers
[24:38] here tonight that would take that same
[24:41] attitude that we're not going to give an
[24:43] inch of ground we're not going to give
[24:45] anything back that God has given us
[24:47] we're we're not going to turn around or
[24:49] we're not going to say we're sorry Mr
[24:51] devil things are getting pressured
[24:53] around here and I think I'll run I I'll
[24:56] just pick up and run off somewhere and
[24:58] get out of the pressure no not this man
[25:01] he was not running from the pressure he
[25:03] was not running from the situation but
[25:05] he said I'm going to pray to God and I'm
[25:08] going to confront this devil and the God
[25:10] that I serve is the same God that Jonah
[25:14] served and he hears the Cry of the
[25:16] righteous and God is able to deliver
[25:20] whatever the situation is God was able
[25:22] to deliver this man was not running this
[25:25] man was not backing up this man was not
[25:27] hiding this man was making a public
[25:30] announcement I will serve God if I have
[25:34] to do it by
[25:36] myself this man was making a public
[25:39] announcement I'm going to preach the
[25:41] gospel if I got to preach it by
[25:43] myself amen I'm going to declare this
[25:46] message if I had to declare it by myself
[25:50] amen I told Brother Brian one time I
[25:52] said I'll tell you this I'd rather have
[25:54] a tambourine and a couple people out in
[25:56] a parking lot and worship God than to be
[25:59] in a house full with a morg and a bunch
[26:02] of dead amen people who don't want to
[26:04] worship God Amen I don't want nothing to
[26:07] do with a bunch of people that that has
[26:09] buried God somewhere and he's dead amen
[26:12] but I believe tonight we don't have to
[26:14] be out in the parking lot by ourselves
[26:17] God has filled your heart with the same
[26:19] desire that you will let this generation
[26:22] no amen I'll tell you this I wasn't put
[26:25] here just to fill up some space I wasn't
[26:28] put here in this age just to be a church
[26:31] member or just to be another person but
[26:34] God put me here to praise and worship in
[26:38] almighty God Amen and that's exactly
[26:40] what I'm going to do if I have to break
[26:42] the laws if I have to if I have to
[26:44] confront the walls of
[26:47] man I could say a lot there but I think
[26:49] we're getting the point amen I think
[26:52] it's I think it's the time that you make
[26:54] up your mind that you're not going to
[26:55] give up your
[26:57] worship you're not going to give up your
[26:59] praise Demons of depression and anxiety
[27:03] and criticism and oppression has told
[27:05] you it does no good to worship it does
[27:08] no good to pray it does no good amen
[27:10] there all these things you're saying
[27:12] that helps they don't help brother Wayne
[27:14] I tell you that's a ly devil amen and if
[27:16] you ever remember what it feels like to
[27:18] praise the Lord you can praise your way
[27:21] out of troubles you can praise your way
[27:23] out of problems you can praise your way
[27:25] out of depression there ain't nobody
[27:28] ever been depressed while they were
[27:29] worshiping God there's nobody ever had
[27:32] to take a nerve pill while the power of
[27:35] God was falling on them my goodness I
[27:39] believe we need to take a take a moment
[27:41] and remember amen that we're not here
[27:44] amen amen we're we're here to declare
[27:47] it openly declare
[27:50] it yes sir then these these men saw
[27:55] Daniel
[27:57] praying we saw him we saw him do it oh
[28:01] King the Bible says it like that that
[28:05] Daniel it's kind of like they say them
[28:08] people oh them people over there bling
[28:11] them people you know them
[28:13] Pentecostals well since when is that a
[28:16] bad
[28:18] name what kind of theology you got that
[28:20] made that a bad
[28:22] name brother BR said I am a
[28:25] Pentecostal have you ever listened to
[28:27] that tape brother brother brand preach
[28:28] called why I am a Holy
[28:34] Roller I don't stick that in your
[28:36] theology and get a
[28:39] way well I I am a Holy Roller can you
[28:42] imagine a prophet a Vindicated Prophet
[28:44] preaching a message like that what was
[28:47] he doing he was killing that Spirit he
[28:50] was destroying the idea that we were
[28:52] going to become a dignified social class
[28:54] of people but we're worshippers of the
[28:56] most high God and Apostle Paul said amen
[29:00] that the way you call heresy is the way
[29:02] that I worship the god of our
[29:05] fathers he was this this man amen was
[29:09] settled down on it and they said them
[29:12] people that Daniel he done broke the law
[29:16] now the Bible said amen that the king
[29:18] basically the King was was was uh he was
[29:22] with the King himself was in trouble
[29:24] because the king had already made a law
[29:27] that couldn't be broken
[29:29] look in the 16th verse then the king
[29:31] commanded and they brought Daniel and
[29:34] they cast him in the Lion's
[29:36] Den now I I think it's pretty amazing
[29:39] that they cast him in the Lion's Den but
[29:42] let's just let me just back up here just
[29:43] a little bit in the 13th verse and they
[29:46] answered and they said before the king
[29:48] the Daniel which is of the children of
[29:50] uh of the Captivity of Judah regardeth
[29:53] not their O King nor the decree that
[29:55] thou has signed but maketh his petition
[29:57] three times a day then the King when he
[29:59] had heard these words was sore
[30:01] displeased with himself and set his
[30:04] heart on Daniel to deliver him I don't
[30:07] know if you've ever studied this section
[30:08] but it's pretty powerful that the king
[30:10] of the country wanted to be Daniel's
[30:14] deliver but his law had already been
[30:17] spoken and he was not able to deliver
[30:21] now I want you to think about this here
[30:22] is a king that is able to cast him in a
[30:25] furnace but not able to deliver him and
[30:28] when the king had finally decided I am
[30:30] not able to deliver thee amen that's
[30:33] when he began to say to him then these
[30:36] men assembled un the king and he said
[30:37] unto the king king that the law the me
[30:39] and the Persians that no decree nor
[30:41] statute which the king established may
[30:43] be changed then the king commanded they
[30:45] brought Daniel and cast him in the den
[30:47] of lions and now the king spake and said
[30:50] unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest
[30:53] continually he will deliver thee now
[30:57] here's a King telling him I can't
[30:59] deliver you but the god you serve he is
[31:02] a deliverer this is a this is a me
[31:05] telling Daniel I'm the king of this
[31:08] whole earth and I can't deliver you but
[31:11] your God he can deliver you amen and
[31:14] when he begins to say this amen the
[31:16] Bible said a stone was brought and laid
[31:18] upon the mouth of the den and the King
[31:20] sealed it with his own signate and the
[31:22] signat of the Lords and the purpose that
[31:25] it might not be changed concerning
[31:26] Daniel so they put put Daniel in the den
[31:28] of
[31:30] lions lions they put him in a Den of
[31:33] Lions Samuel and then they put a stone
[31:35] on the mouth of the cave to be sure that
[31:38] Daniel didn't come out of there they put
[31:41] the king's seal upon the stone to be
[31:43] sure nobody moved the stone and
[31:46] retrieved D Daniel out of there and the
[31:48] King went into his Palace and he passed
[31:50] the night fasting isn't it amazing he
[31:53] had a king in there who wouldn't even
[31:55] eat because he was in the he was in the
[31:58] and the King knew I can't help this man
[32:00] I can't deliver this man but I won't eat
[32:02] and I won't listen to any music amen and
[32:05] he wouldn't even sleep all the night
[32:07] long worried about Daniel that was in
[32:09] that Den of Lions amen so it was early
[32:12] in the morning I bet that King was
[32:14] waiting for the first crack of the Dawn
[32:17] and rode up out of the bed amen and
[32:19] early in the morning he went in haste
[32:21] unto the den of lions and when he had
[32:23] came to the den he cried with a
[32:26] lamentable voice and to Daniel and the
[32:29] King spake and said unto Daniel oh
[32:31] Daniel servant of the Living God is thy
[32:34] God whom thou service continually able
[32:38] to deliver you from the Lions I thought
[32:42] it was amazing he ain't looking for
[32:43] Daniel he's not opened it up yet but he
[32:46] knows if Daniel is alive he'll hear
[32:48] something come out of that Den he knows
[32:51] if Daniel is alive he will speak back
[32:54] concerning his God I thought it was
[32:56] pretty powerful I if I had some time
[32:58] right there I'd preach on them holies of
[33:01] holies if somebody's alive you'll hear
[33:03] some noise in there if somebody is still
[33:06] in there you'll hear the bells Amen
[33:08] brother manam said wherever Jesus is
[33:10] there's a lot of noise I'm quoting a
[33:12] prophet he said listen he said if you're
[33:14] a religion he said if it ain't no noise
[33:16] in it he said it's dead and it needs
[33:19] buried amen but if there is a life in it
[33:22] there'll be a noise in it and it'll cry
[33:24] out holy holy holy but in the 21st verse
[33:27] of Daniel he says this then said Daniel
[33:30] unto the king oh King live
[33:33] forever for my God has sent his Angel
[33:37] and he has shut the lon's mouth and they
[33:40] have not heard me for as much as before
[33:44] his Ines was found in me and also before
[33:47] thee Oh King I have done no hurt now
[33:51] look at this amen he's telling him right
[33:54] then look God has come and shut the m of
[33:58] these Lions he shut them all up amen of
[34:01] course these mouth of lions is
[34:03] representing the mouth of the
[34:05] politicians who's trying to destroy this
[34:07] man amen and they and and since they
[34:10] couldn't do it themselves they gave him
[34:12] over to another Vice to be destroyed
[34:15] amen but nothing they could do to Daniel
[34:17] would destroy him nothing they could put
[34:20] on him would hurt him amen you said
[34:22] what's the secret of Daniel the Bible
[34:24] said he was an innocent man and there
[34:27] was nothing he had done but he had Cried
[34:30] unto his Lord my when I read this amen
[34:34] this is some shout material right here
[34:36] listen what he said he said listen now
[34:38] he said my God has sent his Angel oh
[34:41] King live forever my God has sent his
[34:45] Angel and he has delivered me he has
[34:48] shut the lion's mouth do you do you hear
[34:50] what he's saying he saying I cried to
[34:52] the Lord amen what you tried to keep me
[34:55] from doing up there in my house I did it
[34:58] down here in this dungeon I have defied
[35:01] the king both in my house and in the
[35:04] troubles but I have spoke unto one who
[35:07] can deliver me from the Lions and the
[35:09] Kings and the troubles amen that is all
[35:12] around me when I read this I thought my
[35:15] God sent his Angel unto Daniel Amen
[35:17] maybe you would say to me tonight amen
[35:19] what what happened in that what really
[35:21] happened over there in that Li's Den
[35:23] brother Wayne what was it took place
[35:25] brother bam says and what thank you of
[35:27] Christ
[35:28] he tells us he said when Daniel was
[35:29] through in there in that dungeon with
[35:31] those lons he said all of a sudden
[35:34] something moved and every fiber in my
[35:36] body he's he's telling this in first
[35:38] person with Daniel and he said every
[35:41] person every fiber in my body begin to
[35:43] move and I felt something tingling he
[35:46] said I begin to feel my face as it turns
[35:50] hot and chills went through me and I've
[35:52] seen with a lion's eyes we're all coming
[35:55] and the first thing you know they begin
[35:57] to turn their heads and walked away and
[35:59] when that feeling left me I looked and
[36:02] standing in the corner there stood one
[36:04] who is the Son of God he was standing
[36:07] there God had sent his angels to deliver
[36:11] me if you had Daniel up here tonight
[36:13] what he would tell you is that they
[36:15] threw me in the den of lions and when
[36:18] the and when the hot breath of the Lions
[36:20] was about to take me when the roar was
[36:22] taking my spirit and fear would have
[36:25] been settling upon me he said there was
[36:27] an Ang angel that come in the room you
[36:29] you yall know what that angel was
[36:31] brother R said it was a pillar of fire
[36:33] that come in the room of Daniel he said
[36:35] lions are scared of that Pillar of Fire
[36:39] that fire amen it it's amazing friend
[36:42] when you see that this angel that came
[36:45] into the Den of Lions was a pillar of
[36:48] fire when you you said brother Wayne how
[36:50] are you saying that scripturally well
[36:52] according to the Bible Amen in the book
[36:54] of Exodus it says that when the children
[36:57] of Israel were being delivered out of
[36:59] Egypt that God came to them and said my
[37:01] angel shall go before thee brother B
[37:04] said listen that angel of God he said
[37:07] that led the children of Israel he said
[37:09] it was a pillar of Fire by night and A
[37:11] Cloud by day and I believe he's still
[37:13] leading we know that it was the angel of
[37:15] the Covenant is that right it was the
[37:18] logos of Christ he still the same
[37:22] leading his people here on Earth today
[37:25] what was it that Pillar of Fire that
[37:27] came in that room was the angel of the
[37:29] Lord it was the angel of the Covenant it
[37:32] was Jesus Christ before he come into the
[37:35] flesh he was standing there in the room
[37:38] to tell them these Lions cannot touch
[37:41] you though a host would encamp about you
[37:45] God will shut the mouth of every Lon
[37:48] though thousands of demons Shall Gather
[37:50] around thee amen the spirit of God shall
[37:54] shut the mouth of the lion I thought
[37:56] isn't it something amen I I I get to I'm
[37:59] I'm that guy I get to thinking about
[38:00] these things and I think about that
[38:02] angel that Pillar of Fire that came in
[38:04] that room that Daniel would have seen
[38:06] that light as the Lions begin to move
[38:09] away and the light moved over in the
[38:11] corner and Daniel was able to lay down
[38:14] he was able to lay down the king
[38:16] couldn't sleep up there in the palace
[38:19] amen and Daniel laid down in a den of
[38:22] lions and went to sleep Daniel laid down
[38:25] his head and went to sleep sleep because
[38:28] the angel of the Lord was in the
[38:31] building with him the angel of the Lord
[38:33] was there to deliver him of his trouble
[38:36] he didn't need to sit up all night and
[38:39] fight with the Devils he was in the
[38:41] presence of the Mighty God he was in the
[38:43] presence of the great deliverer there
[38:46] was nothing could touch him there was
[38:48] nothing could harm him he was in the
[38:50] presence of almighty God Amen I tell you
[38:53] amen can you imagine when one of them
[38:54] big old Lions laid down and Daniel he
[38:57] snuggled up against one put his feet on
[38:59] the head of another and he laid his head
[39:01] as a pillow on another it would have
[39:03] been something close to like it was in
[39:05] the Garden of Eden when Adam would have
[39:08] called Leo over and they would have had
[39:10] a little fellowship and he would just
[39:12] pet him and he would have roared listen
[39:14] God can bring an eeden condition in the
[39:17] middle of the greatest troubles that has
[39:19] ever been our God can bring an
[39:22] atmosphere of the grace of God to any
[39:26] situation when the pillar of fire comes
[39:28] in things begin to change troubles begin
[39:32] to fade away problems begin to leave
[39:35] when it's the pillar of fire brother Ram
[39:37] said who was the it was the angel of the
[39:40] Covenant it was none other than Jesus
[39:42] Christ that led them in the in the
[39:44] wilderness when you when you read about
[39:46] this you you read about Daniel imagine
[39:50] he he had a good night sleep knowing
[39:52] that the Angels were there do you know
[39:54] that brother random told us amen that
[39:56] that was a secret with David amen do you
[39:59] if you if you look at the scripture amen
[40:01] it was a secret with these men that the
[40:04] angel of the Lord was with the children
[40:07] of Israel he wasn't with everyone but he
[40:10] was with the children of
[40:12] Israel when I when I I I look into this
[40:15] can I can I just take you uh to a place
[40:18] here in Exodus and and look in the
[40:20] seventh and the eth verse of the book of
[40:22] Exodus where brother Ram takes it he
[40:24] takes it from Exodus
[40:26] uh Exodus chapter 3 and he goes to the
[40:29] 6th to the e8th verse and brother Braham
[40:31] is talking about this angel in the time
[40:35] of Moses was in a bush burning with fire
[40:39] and the scripture says moreover he said
[40:41] I am the god of thy father the god of
[40:44] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[40:46] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[40:48] afraid to look upon God and the Lord
[40:51] said I have surely seen thy Affliction
[40:55] of my people which are in Egypt and I
[40:57] have heard the Cry by the reason of the
[41:00] taskmasters whip for I Know Thy Sorrows
[41:02] watch what he said I have seen thy
[41:04] Affliction I have heard thy cry and I
[41:07] Know Thy Sorrows let me let me bring
[41:09] some comfort to you tonight God has seen
[41:12] your Affliction amen God has heard your
[41:14] cry he said and I Know Thy Sorrows now
[41:18] look what it says in the next verse in
[41:19] the eighth verse he says this and I am
[41:22] come down to deliver I think this is
[41:25] powerful church amen when the children
[41:27] of Israel were 400 years under the
[41:30] bondage and slavery of the Egyptian
[41:33] testmaster amen they had no hope of
[41:36] Deliverance they had no hopes amen but
[41:39] the angel of the Lord came down to Moses
[41:42] and said I have come down but it's for
[41:45] the purpose to deliver I have heard I
[41:48] have seen and I know what kind of
[41:50] situation it is oh think about this
[41:52] tonight when that angel come it come for
[41:54] the purpose to deliver when that angel
[41:57] will come in the days of Moses it was
[41:59] there to deliver people from a situation
[42:03] that was completely impossible for them
[42:05] to ever come out of but God who is rich
[42:08] in Mercy knew that that was his seed and
[42:11] he had promised to Deliverance to
[42:13] Abraham before they had ever got there
[42:16] and when that pillar of Light Came it
[42:18] was the angel of the Lord he had come
[42:21] for the purpose of Deliverance now

[42:26] there to deliver them of the afflictions
[42:28] to take them from it I I when you when
[42:31] you read the Bible I think the Bible is
[42:33] amazing how it's written because if you
[42:35] go over into Psalms the 34th chapter and
[42:37] you read the sixth and the seventh verse
[42:39] this is David writing it's a powerful
[42:42] section of scripture and David said for
[42:44] the poor man cried and the Lord heard
[42:47] him and saved him out of all of his
[42:50] troubles and the angel of the Lord look
[42:53] at that again he lays the Deliverance
[42:56] with the angel of the Lord
[42:57] he said the Lord heard him just like he
[43:00] did in the days of Moses he has heard
[43:02] him out of his troubles his afflictions
[43:06] and the angel of the Lord encampeth
[43:08] about them that fear Him and deliver
[43:10] them my goodness amen the angel of the
[43:13] Lord is camping about them that fear Him
[43:15] and deliver them you want to know how
[43:17] David slept at night when his enemy was
[43:20] all around him because he knew the angel
[43:22] of the Lord encamped about him you know
[43:24] how that there's a bride living in the
[43:26] middle of this age and yet they have
[43:29] comfort in their hearts amen how is it
[43:31] that our minds are not falling apart in
[43:34] the craziest times that ever been
[43:36] because the angel of the Lord encamps
[43:39] about them that fears him I want you to
[43:41] know tonight amen God Is Not A Million
[43:44] Miles Away but to them that fear the
[43:47] lord the angels of God are encamped

[43:52] can't see them with your natural eye but
[43:54] they're here all the same anyhow amen
[43:57] whether we're shouting or whether we're
[43:59] rejoicing or whether we're in troubles
[44:02] or whether there's cries coming from our
[44:04] heart God said the angels of the Lord
[44:07] would encamp about them that fear Him
[44:10] amen I I I know you've heard a lot of
[44:12] sermons on Angels but I just got to
[44:14] preach it to you tonight I happen to
[44:16] believe there's not an empty Pew in this
[44:18] building I believe there's not an empty
[44:20] seat I I believe there's not an empty
[44:22] space but I believe God has filled this
[44:25] building up tonight with angels and
[44:27] theophonic beings I believe Celestial
[44:30] beings are floating through this place
[44:32] Dynamic powers of light and Truth are
[44:35] flashing from every corner because the
[44:37] children of the most high God are here
[44:40] setting in the church tonight you said

[46:09] tired and just say oh well let them do
[46:12] it on their own I tell you what I'm
[46:13] going to do I'm going to preach the word

[47:01] the Lord's here to deliver you you said
[47:04] preacher another service no sir I don't

[47:09] we ought to wait I don't think we ought
[47:11] to say well there'll be another day amen
[47:14] David heard in the days when the
[47:16] Philistines come in the valley he said
[47:19] God should I attack this enemy he said
[47:23] listen David you wait you wait on this
[47:26] and amen and I personally been waiting a
[47:28] few services to get this Old Devil you
[47:31] wait and you wait until you see the
[47:33] rustle in the mberry tree and when you
[47:36] see that rustle you will know the angels
[47:38] have entered the battle and when those
[47:40] angels come in you go into that battle
[47:44] let me say something here tonight the
[47:46] angel of the Lord is in this place
[47:49] tonight and he didn't come here just to
[47:52] stand and speak to you he has come to
[47:55] deliver he's come to deliver lives and
[47:58] to break off those things that have been
[48:00] hanging on to
[48:05] you brother Wayne I don't like your tone
[48:08] let me tell you I don't like the devil I
[48:10] don't like what he's doing I don't like
[48:11] the pressure he puts on the house of God
[48:14] I don't like the things that he throws
[48:16] at the ministry I don't like what the
[48:18] devil does and as long as I'm alive
[48:21] he'll get no peace in the house of God
[48:23] as long as I'm a preacher the devil will
[48:26] not get peace in the house of
[48:30] God so brother way you make me
[48:32] uncomfortable listen if you got a devil
[48:34] on you tonight I pray to God you're the
[48:36] most uncomfortable person in this
[48:38] building until you left the angel of the
[48:40] Lord deliver that off of
[48:44] you
[48:46] oh so brother Wayne I don't know this
[48:50] Bible tells me that Daniel said the
[48:52] angel came for the purpose of
[48:55] Deliverance that's why he
[48:58] came he came to
[49:00] deliver he delivered the children of
[49:02] Israel out of Egypt he delivered Jonah
[49:05] out of the belly of a whale are you with
[49:07] me he J he delivered Joshua from the
[49:10] grip of his enemies he delivered David
[49:13] out of the jaws of a Goliath he was a
[49:16] deliverer then and he's a deliverer now
[49:19] his nature is a nature to deliver he's a
[49:22] God that has the ability to deliver he
[49:25] is still the the angel of the
[49:28] Lord he was a
[49:31] deliverer when he come into Daniel's Den
[49:34] God was a deliverer that night he said
[49:37] preacher that's all the way back then
[49:39] well what did Paul meet when he met on
[49:40] the road to Damascus when Paul was going
[49:43] to kill some Christians he wasn't in a
[49:45] Den of Lions he was under the thicket of
[49:48] theology he had a bondage of some
[49:51] doctrine that a man had put on him and
[49:54] he was under the bonds of that Doctrine
[49:56] and and he was literally trying to
[49:58] destroy the work of God because of the
[50:01] doctrine that was in his heart and God
[50:03] was merciful enough to meet him on the
[50:07] road and let the grace of God deliver
[50:11] him from the teachings of Gia and to be
[50:14] translated into the revelation of Jesus
[50:17] Christ when that light flashed across
[50:19] his life he said Lord who are
[50:22] you scripture will answer now who is the
[50:25] Angel Daniel sace the pillar fire
[50:27] according to the Book of Exodus it was
[50:29] Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant
[50:31] but Paul said Lord who are you he said I
[50:33] am
[50:35] Jesus I am Jesus whom thou persecute can
[50:39] you imagine persecuting a Christian is
[50:42] persecuting Jesus Christ to persecute a
[50:45] Believer is to persecute Jesus Christ
[50:48] look at what he said I am Jesus whom
[50:50] thou persecutest and Paul went away and
[50:52] wrote Hebrews the 13th chapter and said
[50:55] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[51:00] and forever now look what happened when
[51:02] Apostle Peter was taken into the jail
[51:04] and he was laying deep in the dungeon
[51:06] that night remember what happens when
[51:09] they come in there and they bound him
[51:10] but there's a prayer meeting going on
[51:12] and they're praying for deliverance to
[51:14] come to Peter who came for his
[51:18] Deliverance who came for his Deliverance
[51:21] the Bible tells us that he was fast
[51:23] asleep I believe it was and there was
[51:25] something coming the room and smote him
[51:27] on the side and woke him
[51:29] up and I'll tell you this right now if
[51:32] you ever see you're in the presence of
[51:35] the Angel of the Lord it'll wake you
[51:38] up it'll wake you up amen it'll make you
[51:41] aware that you're in the presence than
[51:43] more than just a bunch of humble
[51:47] people the Bible tells us that he loosed
[51:50] Peter from the chains that he loosed him
[51:53] and he led him out of the prison Gates
[51:57] isn't that powerful and to the place he
[52:00] was delivered by the angel of the Lord
[52:03] amen if you want to watch it in the
[52:04] scripture Paul and Silas they was
[52:06] captured put into prison and while they
[52:09] were in the prison amen something
[52:11] happened in there they could not stay in
[52:14] the bondage of man they were innocent
[52:17] the only thing they done was worshiped
[52:19] God but they were being put in bondage
[52:22] and while the bondage was upon them they
[52:25] begin to worship ship God and why they
[52:28] begin to worship I don't know what kind
[52:31] of tune they were
[52:32] singing I don't know if they were in
[52:34] harmony but I know something happened
[52:37] that God honored what they were saying
[52:39] he honored have you ever have you ever
[52:41] noticed amen sometime you get a good
[52:43] anointed song leader I believe brother
[52:44] Ben's a good anointed song leader we get
[52:46] brother Ben up here and he gets to
[52:48] moving around a little bit and when he
[52:49] finds that certain song and the presence
[52:52] of God just fills the room amen because
[52:55] God's pleased he likes what's being sung
[52:58] he likes it he begins to move on it all
[53:00] of a sudden Hearts begin to be delivered
[53:03] lives begin to be changed because the
[53:05] presence of the Lord is changing lives
[53:09] look Apostle Paul when the when when the
[53:11] singing started the earth started
[53:14] shaking I asked brother way if I could
[53:16] just preach he said yeah I could so the
[53:18] earth started shaking and when the earth
[53:20] started shaking what happened the old
[53:22] the old bars couldn't hold
[53:25] it you know what happened to those bars
[53:27] something shook them loose amen you know
[53:30] what you know want to shake a loose a a
[53:32] man from a devil you don't want to shake
[53:34] him loose I tell you what a prophet said
[53:36] will do the shaking he said it'll take
[53:38] those seven unknown Thunders to do it
[53:40] amen that's what he said wasn't it and
[53:42] he said that's the kind of Thunder the
[53:44] devil's scared of is when a life is
[53:47] being lived it is a voice of Revelation
[53:50] and it shakes up the devil's Kingdom and
[53:53] while they were being shook up I was
[53:54] noticing this the other day it went when
[53:56] those bars Begin to Fall there was a
[53:58] gentile amongst them who was a Jailer
[54:00] can you imagine being the guy that was
[54:02] to keep Paul in
[54:03] jail utterly
[54:07] failing can't keep this guy locked up
[54:11] and when the when the walls Begin to
[54:13] Fall do you know he was going to take
[54:15] his own
[54:16] life he was about to commit suicide how
[54:19] many ever read it you notice something
[54:22] Paul couldn't see the man it was in the
[54:24] darkness he wasn't close to where Paul
[54:26] was but out of the darkness Paul screams
[54:29] out and says Don't Take Your Life
[54:31] Soldier Boy amen don't you take your
[54:34] life as a God here to deliver you amen
[54:37] we've heard that same voice in this last
[54:39] day when there was a young man sitting
[54:41] in a meeting and the same light that was
[54:44] in the prison with Paul was in the
[54:47] meetings with William Bram and when they
[54:49] begin to feel that way that Spirit would
[54:52] speak out don't take your life soldier
[54:55] boy there's a greater Deliverance God is
[54:58] a deliverer Jesus Christ is a deliverer
[55:01] he's a powerful deliverer he was a
[55:03] deliver in Daniel's day he was a
[55:05] delivering Paul's
[55:09] day and the Bible said that I have come
[55:12] down in Revelations the 10th chapter and
[55:15] he came for the purpose of
[55:18] Deliverance I've always been amazed at
[55:21] the vision brother bandam tells about
[55:23] about the people when they're trapped in
[55:25] those in those bars I've always been
[55:28] amazed when brother bam tells about a
[55:30] vision or a dream that he has where
[55:32] there's a host of people and they're in
[55:34] these
[55:36] cages and brother bam is saying to them
[55:38] what's wrong with you and they said
[55:39] brother bam we need more now brother Ram
[55:42] knew the one man he had some he had some
[55:44] problems with his eyes his eyes had been
[55:47] had been cast over and he he wasn't able
[55:50] to see good he said we need more brother
[55:52] brandom and they were in there them
[55:54] people he said brother brand these
[55:55] people in this are good people he said
[55:57] they just misunderstood
[56:01] you how many people today are in a cage
[56:05] because of
[56:08] misunderstandings because they
[56:10] misunderstood him they were in that
[56:12] cage but you look at the mercies of God
[56:16] brother bam said I seen that angel that
[56:19] Pillar of Fire turned into a rainbow
[56:21] over there and spoke to me and said
[56:24] deliver this people and brother bam said
[56:27] there I was he said and I thought how
[56:29] could I ever do
[56:32] it how could I ever do it and the Lord
[56:36] said you deliver these people and
[56:38] brother Bram said I spoke up and he said
[56:41] I felt the strength come into to me and
[56:43] he began to say house of Hell give way
[56:46] in the name of Jesus Christ and he said
[56:49] the bars Begin to Fall amen what was
[56:51] going on there was a strength that come
[56:54] into him because he found own the
[56:57] purpose of God in the age he was living
[57:00] in God came to the Earth to deliver the
[57:03] church from denominational thinking from
[57:06] ideas and the mark of the beast he came
[57:08] to deliver the church from the things of
[57:11] this world and set them at Deliverance
[57:13] in this hour that same Jesus is in this
[57:16] building
[57:17] today come on now I can prove to you by
[57:20] the Bible for the next 20 minutes if it
[57:22] would take it but just take my word he
[57:24] said wherever two or three are GED in my
[57:26] name there I will be in the midst of
[57:29] them the same angel that was in a Den of
[57:32] Lions is here in True Word Tabernacle
[57:35] tonight the same angel that was in the
[57:38] jail with Apostle Peter is here in the
[57:41] building tonight the same angel that met

[57:47] building tonight he's not here to hurt

[58:42] my God is a
[58:45] deliverer yes sir brother brandom said I
[58:47] never drank or smoke or defile my body
[58:49] in any way and God used him to prove
[58:52] that he could keep a man God used that
[58:55] man in a azerite vow and it's a it's a
[58:58] testimony I wished I had my wife holds
[59:01] that testimony she told me one time said
[59:04] Wayne I don't have a testimony like
[59:05] yours I said no you got one like brother
[59:08] brandom's never drank or smoke or defile
[59:11] or body in any way but I don't have that

[59:17] an aent of lions and God can deliver you
[59:20] amen my testimony says you can be a pit
[59:23] of Destruction and God can deliver you
[59:25] I'm saying that his ear is not too heavy
[59:28] and his hand is not too short you cannot
[59:30] get to a place that my God can't reach
[59:32] you you can't get into the deepest
[59:35] darkest recesses of your mind you can
[59:38] run all you want to but you'll never
[59:40] hide from this light it'll reach into
[59:43] your life it'll reach into your
[59:45] heart I remember I remember I was just
[59:49] just turning just after 20 years old
[59:51] moving toward 21 right in that phace of
[59:53] my life I've been chewing Copenhagen
[59:55] since I was about 13 years old and we
[59:57] grew up it's tobacco you put in your lip
[59:59] like an idiot you know and you you don't
[1:00:02] just chew it I chewed it my Grandpa
[1:00:03] chewed it I guess it's where I learned
[1:00:05] it and and you learned it but then you
[1:00:07] couldn't you couldn't chew it all the
[1:00:09] time so I learned to dip it learned to
[1:00:11] smoke it and tobacco took a hold of my
[1:00:14] life it took a grip of my life and when
[1:00:17] I got ready to give my heart to the Lord
[1:00:20] it was one of the biggest hindrances I
[1:00:22] had in my life was tobacco but you know
[1:00:25] what I kept coming to the house of the
[1:00:26] Lord amen and and I got to I got to
[1:00:29] coming in night after night sitting on
[1:00:30] the front row there every time they'd
[1:00:32] have a prayer meeting I'd go pray with
[1:00:34] everybody asking the Lord for
[1:00:36] deliverance I'd get up and leave the
[1:00:38] building go out there set in the car and
[1:00:39] put a chew the back in my mouth some
[1:00:41] days I'd make it two or three days
[1:00:43] between the time I I I'd make it a
[1:00:45] couple days and but before Sunday would
[1:00:47] come I'd had to have me a chew couldn't
[1:00:49] help it I'd come in the house of God I'd
[1:00:52] be condemned about 3/4 through the
[1:00:54] service I'd make my mind up i' repent
[1:00:56] Lord I won't never do it again Lord I'd
[1:00:58] get out the door here itd come back see
[1:01:00] I had a heart to not do it but I was
[1:01:03] seriously in bondage it was not that I
[1:01:05] wanted to do it I didn't have a choice
[1:01:08] people say well I'm free I smoked and
[1:01:10] drink and all that no you ain't free try
[1:01:11] to quit it and see if you're
[1:01:13] free you're not free it'll take a
[1:01:16] deliverer to take that out of you people
[1:01:18] say well I quit smoking and I quit
[1:01:20] drinking but you never did quit Desiring
[1:01:22] it did you but if God ever takes it out
[1:01:25] of you if God ever delivers a man he
[1:01:27] don't just take the Habit he takes the
[1:01:30] desire of it out of your
[1:01:35] heart I can testify tonight my God can
[1:01:39] deliver a man of tobacco there's a boy
[1:01:41] sitting right back there brother Johnny
[1:01:43] come into a little Fellowship one night
[1:01:45] and we were preaching he come up to me
[1:01:47] after service and I saw a tobacco can in
[1:01:50] his front pocket and I started telling
[1:01:51] him how God delivered me amen and and
[1:01:54] and when you preach against tobacco or
[1:01:56] something somebody's doing the first
[1:01:57] thing they say well I just won't go back
[1:01:59] to church that's the worst thing you
[1:02:00] ever
[1:02:01] done how you going to get cleaned up if
[1:02:03] you don't come take a
[1:02:05] bath I told my mama I said Mama I don't
[1:02:08] want to be a hypocrite I don't want to
[1:02:09] go to church and then chew that debacco
[1:02:11] and come to church and she said Wayne
[1:02:13] she said do you have you ever cleaned up
[1:02:15] to take a bath or do you take a bath to
[1:02:17] clean up I said I take a bath to clean
[1:02:20] up she said then coming to church is
[1:02:21] taking a bath you come to church and let
[1:02:24] the washing of the water of the word
[1:02:26] take those things off of but see the
[1:02:28] modern day we're living in nobody wants
[1:02:30] nobody to preach against nothing anymore

[1:02:45] to see converts to the baptism of the
[1:02:48] Holy Ghost listen we got oh God help me

[1:02:56] confidence in God to preach an
[1:02:57] experience they don't have enough
[1:02:59] confidence in God to preach a
[1:03:00] Deliverance but I have been delivered I
[1:03:04] can promise you that if you approach the
[1:03:07] same God I approach you will get a
[1:03:10] deliverance from that
[1:03:13] God I know they're cutting the cost
[1:03:16] they're running specials on it now you
[1:03:18] can be the bride if you just believe a
[1:03:19] certain
[1:03:20] Doctrine they cut the cost but it's a
[1:03:23] useless piece of uh it's a
[1:03:27] huh it won't get you
[1:03:30] nowhere now when you cut the cost of
[1:03:33] this gospel let me promise you this this
[1:03:35] birth is the cost for every man it'll
[1:03:38] cost the same P same thing to every
[1:03:40] person that ever did it but whenever you
[1:03:43] give your life to the Lord he'll clean

[1:04:15] truth and the Same Spirit of toaca that
[1:04:19] makes you want it and spend your money
[1:04:21] making you stink and your and your lungs
[1:04:23] being deteriorated is the same spirit
[1:04:26] that gives life to cancer that'll kill
[1:04:28] you and destroy your family amen why
[1:04:31] would you ever defend the devil that
[1:04:34] destroys as many people as cigarettes
[1:04:36] does Amen but God has come to be a
[1:04:40] deliverer in the house of
[1:04:44] God I know it's Thursday night but it's
[1:04:46] the
[1:04:50] truth stood over there in
[1:04:53] India man walk up to me was a hind

[1:05:46] there's nothing I can do to get loose of
[1:05:48] this it is destroying me he said but I
[1:05:51] heard I heard that that Jesus that you
[1:05:54] serve he has the power to deliver a man
[1:05:57] he has the power to break these kind of
[1:05:59] habits I said brother let me tell you
[1:06:02] God sent me all the way to India to
[1:06:04] testify that God can deliver a man from
[1:06:07] alcohol and you know what we' seen that
[1:06:09] man come up there a young man he knelt
[1:06:12] down right there in the street there in
[1:06:14] India and I laid my hand on that man and
[1:06:17] begin to pray and God heard my prayer
[1:06:21] all the way in the streets of India just
[1:06:23] like he does in this building tonight

[1:06:30] there with Peter came on the streets of
[1:06:33] India and delivered a Hindu priest of
[1:06:35] being an alcohol listen this message is
[1:06:38] more than theology it's more than a
[1:06:41] bunch of doctrines and building churches

[1:06:46] has come to deliver a church and to take
[1:06:49] them in a Rapture it's come to give you

[1:07:33] Redemption oh can our musicians come God
[1:07:36] can change it God can change
[1:07:38] everything you know what this Bible
[1:07:41] tells me if you just keep reading for a
[1:07:43] minute it says that Daniel come climbing
[1:07:46] out of that Line's den and when he come
[1:07:49] out of that den of liines that King took
[1:07:52] his
[1:07:54] accusers
[1:07:56] and turned around and throw them in that
[1:07:58] Line's
[1:08:00] Den let me tell you something the Bible
[1:08:03] said that they were devoured before they
[1:08:06] hit the
[1:08:07] ground they didn't even hit the ground
[1:08:10] before the lies had got on them amen do
[1:08:13] you see what it is God always does it he
[1:08:16] always does it read the book of Esther
[1:08:18] and see that when Mori and hmon were
[1:08:21] having a fight hmon decided I will
[1:08:23] destroy that man of God and he hung on
[1:08:26] his own Gallows amen God used Goliath's
[1:08:31] own sword to cut off his head God will
[1:08:34] do it every time amen if God before you
[1:08:38] who can be against you God will turn the
[1:08:40] table on the devil and place you back in
[1:08:43] the power of
[1:08:45] God listen he's the god of Heaven he's
[1:08:48] the god of power he's the god of
[1:08:51] Deliverance and he's my God he's your
[1:08:54] God he's not just Daniel's
[1:08:57] God I like to done a backflip today when
[1:09:00] I was reading that and I seen that angel
[1:09:02] and brother B ties it directly with a
[1:09:04] pillar of fire that's in his meetings
[1:09:06] amen let me tell you this he ties it
[1:09:08] directly without a doubt then that means
[1:09:10] something to me the same God that I
[1:09:13] serve is the same God Daniel was serving
[1:09:16] it's not another God it's not like that
[1:09:19] God it's the same Jesus
[1:09:24] Christ
[1:09:29] brother why why you so excited cuz I
[1:09:31] done I done read the end of the
[1:09:34] story and I does seem that

[1:09:41] been trying to throw

[1:09:48] of the
[1:09:49] blood you know it can transform you and
[1:09:51] transfer your life Chloe you you know
[1:09:54] the power of it can take you and change
[1:09:56] it can change everything it's powerful
[1:09:59] isn't it how it changes there's one
[1:10:01] portion of the power of that blood
[1:10:02] that's amazing to me as an individual
[1:10:04] brother brandom said it had the power to
[1:10:06] transfer your sins from you to the head
[1:10:08] of the
[1:10:12] devil it has the transferring power if
[1:10:15] you get under the blood the sins that's
[1:10:18] on you actually end up on the devil and
[1:10:22] the devil is thrown into the Lake of
[1:10:24] Fire for sins that he would have had you
[1:10:26] commit of the problems that was put upon
