TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] When my heart is broken, when my life is empty, I can't see your face. I can't hear your voice. When I'm feeling helpless, wondering in the darkness, surrounded by fear and defeat, [Music] I have a choice to make. No matter what comes my way, I choose to worship. I choose to praise. I choose to lift up the name above all. I choose surrender. I choose to believe that you for all you will be. I choose to worship. [Music] Even in the fire, even in the valley, I can have joy and I can have peace. You are always with me and never will forsake me. Your presence is all that I need. And I have a choice to make. Heat. Heat. I surrender. I choose to believe for all that you and for all you will be. I choose to worship. And though we are pressed on every side, praise is our weapon. And we'll win this fight. We made our choice. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] to believe that you are all you will be. We choose to sh and all you will be. We choose to worship. We choose to worship you, Lord. We choose to worship. We choose to worship. I choose to worship. [Music] [Applause] [Music]
