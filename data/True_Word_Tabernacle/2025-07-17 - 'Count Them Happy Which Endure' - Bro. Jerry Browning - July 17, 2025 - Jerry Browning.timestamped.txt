[41:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Uh I
[41:24] uh I was talking to brother Wayne and I
[41:27] I'm thankful for brother Wayne uh having
[41:30] us come and uh thankful for brother Ray
[41:34] Ericson and uh actually he he's been
[41:37] quite influential in my life. Uh I uh
[41:42] Lord called me into the ministry in 1983
[41:45] and uh I think I'd maybe preached one
[41:49] time at the church up there that my
[41:51] father had started and then brother Ray
[41:54] found out that the Lord had called me to
[41:57] the ministry. So he called me on the
[41:59] phone and asked me to come and and I I I
[42:03] don't remember if you were in Bluffton
[42:04] or Fost or Fosttori at that time. I
[42:08] think it might have been Fostoriia and
[42:11] &gt;&gt; 83 would have been Fostori.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so uh so it's the first place
[42:15] uh I ever went and preached when I going
[42:17] out. So and of course I've uh known the
[42:21] Ericson family for many many years. And
[42:24] me and I know he's here somewhere maybe
[42:26] tonight right back there. Ehi
[42:29] uh we were uh best friends and things
[42:32] and we still are brother. I know we
[42:34] don't hardly see each other, but uh
[42:37] you're still dear to my heart
[42:39] &gt;&gt; and uh and we uh
[42:43] so uh just uh and I'm sure there's many
[42:47] that I I can't place and and see that I
[42:50] I remember over the years things and and
[42:54] uh so but it's it's wonderful to be here
[42:56] with you tonight. And if the I was kind
[43:00] of feeling on my heart as coming down
[43:02] thinking about I was leaving from up.
[43:04] I'd been in brother Paula Fontaine's
[43:06] last night and uh I was thinking what
[43:08] would the Lord have me to speak on when
[43:10] I came and I was kind of feeling
[43:12] something pulled on my heart a certain
[43:14] way and uh so when I met with brother
[43:17] Wayne, brother Wayne said, "Brother, if
[43:19] you if you feel led of the Lord," he
[43:21] said, "Try to share maybe a little your
[43:24] testimony how God healed you."
[43:26] And uh so uh that was what I was
[43:29] actually already feeling on my heart.
[43:31] But when he said it, then the Lord kind
[43:33] of dropped a couple of scriptures.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Into my heart with it. And uh so uh
[43:39] maybe tonight we'll we'll read a couple
[43:41] of scriptures and I'll speak just a
[43:43] little bit and then maybe the Lord will
[43:44] help us to share our testimony. Amen.
[43:47] So I want to
[43:50] uh read first from James chapter 5 and
[43:54] uh verses 7- 11.
[44:01] If I to title this tonight, I'd like to
[44:04] title it uh count them happy which
[44:08] endure.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Count them happy which endure. Amen.
[44:13] Be patient, therefore, brethren, until
[44:15] the coming of the Lord.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That says a lot right there,
[44:19] doesn't it? That's actually where we're
[44:21] at right now.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the
[44:25] precious fruits of the earth, and have
[44:27] long patience for it, until he receiveth
[44:29] the early and latter rain. Be ye also
[44:32] patient. Establish your hearts, for the
[44:35] coming of the Lord drawth nigh. Grudge
[44:37] not against another, brethren, lest ye
[44:40] be condemned. Behold the judge standeth
[44:42] before the door. Take my brethren the
[44:45] prophets who have spoken in the name of
[44:47] the Lord for an example of suffering
[44:50] affliction and of patience. Behold, we
[44:53] count them happy which endure. Ye have
[44:56] heard of the patience of Job and have
[44:59] seen the end of the Lord that the Lord
[45:01] is very pitiful and of t tender mercy.
[45:05] I'd also like to read from Hebrews
[45:07] chapter 6 uh verses 10- uh 15.
[45:17] For God is not unrighteous to forget
[45:19] your work and labor of love which ye
[45:22] have showed toward his name in that ye
[45:25] have ministered to the saints and do
[45:27] minister. And we desire that every one
[45:29] of you should show the same diligence to
[45:31] the full assurance of hope and to the
[45:33] end. That ye be not slothful, but
[45:35] followers of them who through faith and
[45:37] patience inherited the promises. For
[45:40] when God had made a promise to Abraham,
[45:42] because he could swear by no greater, he
[45:45] swear by himself, saying, "Surely
[45:47] blessing I will bless thee, multiply,
[45:49] and I will multiply thee." And so after
[45:52] he had patiently endured, he obtained
[45:54] the promise. Amen. You may be seated.
[45:59] I want to really emphasize on this word
[46:02] endure here.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; You know, endure. It means you you're
[46:06] you're holding fast.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; You you you get a hold of uh what your
[46:12] your rest your faith on on the promises
[46:16] of God. And then no matter what's going
[46:18] on, no matter how you feel, no matter
[46:20] what affliction you're suffering, no
[46:22] matter what's going on, whether it's a
[46:24] good day, a bad day, a happy day, or a
[46:26] sad day, you are holding fast.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Whether it's a hard day or an easy day,
[46:32] you're holding fast to the promises of
[46:34] God. Even when your body is not
[46:36] testifying that the that of the promise
[46:39] of God, but you believe and you are
[46:42] holding fast that God is going to bring
[46:44] your body into subjection and bring the
[46:48] promise of God about to you. Amen. Uh
[46:52] you know whether you need healing,
[46:54] whether you need the Holy Ghost,
[46:55] whatever you need, you know you that's a
[46:57] promise of God to you and you endure.
[47:00] You stay right there holding fast until
[47:03] God comes and confirms that promise in
[47:06] your life.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we find here that that
[47:10] Abraham, brother Brennham brings this
[47:12] out how Abraham, he patiently endured.
[47:16] Hallelujah. And and you know it, brother
[47:19] Ram speaks about uh from Hebrews chapter
[47:23] 4 about holding fast to our profession.
[47:27] and and and he says this uh uh this
[47:30] first quote I want to read to you. He
[47:31] said, "If he's Jehovah Raphi, the
[47:34] healer, if he promised to heal me, I'll
[47:37] take him at his word. If he promised me
[47:39] the Holy Ghost was to me, I'll stay
[47:42] there till it comes. That's all." That's
[47:45] right. He promised it. Stay with it.
[47:47] Just take him at his word. Stay right
[47:49] there. That's the only way to do it.
[47:53] Brother says the thing is he says a lot
[47:55] of us we're afraid to testify even you
[47:58] know even with our faith and we're
[48:01] believing and you know many people think
[48:03] well I can't testify until it's actually
[48:05] happened but friends you can testify of
[48:08] your faith you can take a stand and
[48:11] testify saying I believe this look at
[48:14] brother Brandham when he begins to talk
[48:16] about John Ryan you know with the the
[48:18] eyes that were blind John Ryan was blind
[48:21] he couldn't see. But he was going around
[48:23] telling people, "I can see." And they
[48:26] say, "John, can you see today?" And he
[48:28] would say, "Yes, I can see. By his
[48:30] stripes, I'm healed." He was down on the
[48:32] corner passing out newspapers saying,
[48:35] "Extra, extra, read all about it. By his
[48:38] stripes, I am healed." And he was
[48:40] standing there just as blind as a post,
[48:44] but he was testifying of his faith.
[48:47] [Applause]
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; You know what brother said? He was he
[48:54] was brother Random was uh referring to
[48:57] when David talked in in the book of
[48:59] Psalms uh verse, you know, in chapter 23
[49:03] and and David was saying, "Yay, though I
[49:06] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[49:07] death, I feel no evil evil, for thou are
[49:10] with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
[49:11] cover me." And he said, "Thou prepareest
[49:13] the table before me in the presence of
[49:16] my enemies. Thou anointest my head with
[49:18] oil." And brother says, "Have you ever
[49:20] got anointed in the presence of your
[49:23] enemy?" He said, "Get up and get
[49:25] anointed. Get in God and get anointed in
[49:28] the presence of your enemy and testify
[49:31] that his promises are real."
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, faith isn't based on
[49:43] what you can see. That's right.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; It ain't fa It ain't based on what you
[49:49] can feel.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; It's based on It actually is the
[49:53] evidence. Just having that faith,
[49:56] testifying of that faith is the evidence
[50:00] that it exists.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of the unseen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of of of what cannot
[50:10] be felt. It's the evidence of what even
[50:13] isn't have even manifested yet.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends. I don't see a rapture,
[50:20] but I can tell you this. You'll never
[50:21] convince me that there isn't a rapture.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; I remember one time, you know, my dad
[50:30] years ago, he was testifying to his
[50:32] father and and he was telling him about
[50:35] brother Brandham, you know, speaking the
[50:36] squirrels into existence. And you know,
[50:39] my grandfather, he was actually a
[50:41] backsliding Pentecostal man. He had been
[50:42] backslid for years. But my dad was
[50:45] testifying, witnessing to him and and
[50:47] was telling about God sent a prophet and
[50:49] said, and he was telling about him the
[50:51] third pulling him speaking the squirrels
[50:52] into existence.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; My grandfather looked at him and he
[50:56] said, "Were you there when he spoke the
[50:58] squirrels into existence?" My dad said,
[51:01] "No." He said, "Well, then how do you
[51:03] know what happened?" My dad said, he
[51:06] said, I I I was stumped for just a
[51:08] moment. He said, then I asked him, I
[51:10] said, "Dad, you've read in the Bible
[51:12] where God took uh mud and put it on a
[51:15] blind man's eyes and to went out and
[51:17] washed it off and and and he seen." He
[51:19] goes, "Oh, yeah." He said, "Do you
[51:21] believe that happened?" He said, "Yeah."
[51:23] He said, "Were you there?"
[51:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "The same way you believe that
[51:29] happened and you know that happened,
[51:31] that's the same way I know this
[51:32] happened."
[51:33] &gt;&gt; What is it, France? It's it's a
[51:35] revelation. Brother said faith is a
[51:37] revelation. It's not something that you
[51:40] sit around and reason on and figure out.
[51:42] It's something that drops down in acres
[51:45] in your soul. And friends, you might not
[51:47] be able to explain it. It may not make
[51:49] sense to anybody else. You may not even
[51:52] be able to make sense of it to yourself,
[51:54] but it's anchored there and nothing will
[51:57] shake it.
[52:00] Now
[52:00] &gt;&gt; that's that is the kind of faith that
[52:02] God will come and honor.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Get anointed in your presence of your
[52:09] enemy.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get anointed. Amen. By the spirit
[52:13] of God and get up and testify right in
[52:15] the devil's face. Him pointing to you
[52:18] and saying you feel sick as a dog right
[52:20] now tonight. But you testify and say, "I
[52:23] am healed." Why can you testify that?
[52:26] because he said, "I am the Lord thy God
[52:29] that health thee." And David testified
[52:32] and said, "He forgiveth all of my
[52:34] iniquities. He health health all a
[52:37] double L all of my diseases."
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; There is nothing. Think about this.
[52:45] Brother Random said the angel of the
[52:47] Lord came to him and said, "If you can
[52:49] get the people to believe you, nothing
[52:50] will stand before your prayer." And and
[52:52] listen to what he said. He said, "Not
[52:54] even cancer. That's right.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, in that day and at that
[52:59] time, cancer was actually a much bigger
[53:01] thing than even what it is today.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; They don't actually have a cure for it
[53:05] today, but then back then, they didn't
[53:07] even have treatments really for it.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; I believe, friends, we've got some
[53:13] things today actually that are much
[53:15] bigger than cancer.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; You know what the You know what the the
[53:19] biggest hindrance to people's faith is?
[53:23] is ignorance about what they've been
[53:26] afflicted with.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; They they they you know, the devil can
[53:32] work so much on your mind if you
[53:35] actually don't know what's going on.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; He can tell you anything.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Got to recognize it.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Abraham now I'm not going to go
[53:51] into the whole story about Abraham
[53:52] tonight but you know brother Brandham
[53:54] points this out and he he says uh uh
[53:57] I'll read this is from he swore by
[53:59] himself and and brother says and so
[54:01] after he had patiently endured he
[54:04] obtained the promise
[54:06] &gt;&gt; after he had patiently endured brother
[54:08] said can you set your faith tonight and
[54:12] say this is thus sayeth the Lord and no
[54:14] matter what goes on whether it's today
[54:16] is easy whether Tomorrow is hard. No
[54:19] matter what happens, he said from day to
[54:22] day, can you endure? Can you set your
[54:25] faith and endure? Hold fast to your
[54:29] profession.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, now listen, Abraham didn't
[54:36] get it before.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; He got it after he endured.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After he endured. Paul says
[54:43] this. He Paul says that he endured uh
[54:46] afflictions. And he said, "I endured."
[54:50] And he actually names off, you know,
[54:51] several things there in the book of
[54:53] Timothy. Uh you know, persecutions,
[54:55] afflictions, and and and all kinds of
[54:57] things. And he said, "But I endure." And
[55:00] and and he said, "But out of them all,
[55:03] the Lord delivered me."
[55:06] &gt;&gt; There is nothing too big for God.
[55:08] There's nothing too small for God.
[55:12] Sometimes people think, well, you know,
[55:14] I can see somebody going to get prayed
[55:15] for it for cancer. We know God will heal
[55:17] that and everything else. But I'm going
[55:18] to tell you something, friends. Read
[55:20] through the message. Listen to the
[55:21] prayer lines. There's times, brother
[55:22] Random called people out and said,
[55:24] "You've got allergies. God has healed
[55:26] you."
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Something so simple and little as they
[55:31] were having a a reaction to pollen or
[55:34] something in the air.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; God cares about you. Yes, that's right.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You You know what the the Bible says?
[55:44] The Bible says in Philippians, Paul
[55:46] writes, "Be careful for nothing."
[55:50] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? It means don't
[55:51] be anxious.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; You know what anxious is? Being worried,
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Freddy,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; being nervous about it.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; You know, and many times people get that
[56:01] way because they they they're they're in
[56:03] a problem. They're in a a trial and they
[56:06] can't figure out how to get out of it.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; They're trying to solve it themselves.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, friends, my own
[56:14] experience, the more you try to solve
[56:17] it, the more you just get in God's way.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; What you need to do is pray, commit it
[56:22] to God, put it in his hands, and walk
[56:24] on.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Quit worrying about it, cuz your
[56:28] worrying ain't going to change nothing.
[56:30] That's right. That's just the devil
[56:31] trying to drag you down and keep you
[56:33] tormented.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Be anxious for nothing. Be careful for
[56:40] nothing. Paul says, and he says, "And
[56:42] the peace of God
[56:43] &gt;&gt; which surpasses all understanding."
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, how you know, listen,
[56:52] he he says here, "Be careful for nothing
[56:55] but with prayer and supplications."
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. and with thanksgiving let your
[57:01] requests be known.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; You know, you think, well, why did Paul
[57:05] say prayer and supplications?
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Well, prayer, that's just your daily
[57:10] communication with God.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Supplications is actually when you go
[57:14] and you're asking God, you're making a
[57:16] request.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; A lot of times people don't get what
[57:20] they what they need because they ain't
[57:22] asking.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And there's a very simple principle of
[57:26] the Bible. Knock and the door shall be
[57:28] open. Seek and you'll find. Ask and you
[57:31] shall receive.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, kindergarteners can
[57:37] understand that.
[57:40] [Music]
[57:43] &gt;&gt; You don't believe it? Oh yeah. Well, my
[57:47] I'm sorry. I don't mean to jump off on
[57:49] things, but I want to tell you
[57:50] something.
[57:51] Sometimes ministers are afraid to share
[57:53] their personal experiences and let
[57:55] themselves look vulnerable before the
[57:57] people.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; But I find that when I read the message
[58:00] and I listen to the prophet, I find that
[58:02] he not only shared all of the
[58:04] supernatural experiences, but he
[58:06] actually also shared all his faults, his
[58:10] failures, and his mistakes, his
[58:12] downfalls.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And you know what the prophet said about
[58:15] that? He said, "I I hope that my the my
[58:19] mistakes won't be stumbling blocks, but
[58:21] they'll be stepping stones
[58:23] &gt;&gt; to help somebody."
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, I want I want to
[58:26] be like Abraham. He said, Abraham made
[58:29] mistakes. He he had failures. He said,
[58:32] but when the divine commentary was wrote
[58:34] of Abraham's life, it never God never
[58:36] mentioned any of his mistakes, any of
[58:39] his failures. Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; He said that Abraham staggered not at
[58:45] the promise of God.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; But was strong in the faith.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "That's how I want my
[58:54] divine commentary to be wrote. That's
[58:56] how I want my divine commentary to be
[58:58] wrote."
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, write it like that.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, friends. I'm not
[59:02] afraid to tell you about my mistakes or
[59:04] what I've done wrong or whatever else.
[59:06] Because you know why? I if if brother
[59:08] Brandham hadn't have done that, then in
[59:10] my mind, I don't know how you'd have
[59:11] felt about it, but in my mind, it would
[59:13] have put him as being like some
[59:15] superhuman that I could never attain to
[59:18] what he had.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; That that he was able to do that and
[59:21] have that life because he was a prophet.
[59:23] Well, I know he was a prophet. I know
[59:25] that he was a gift. I'm not looking for
[59:27] that gift. But you know what? I'm
[59:28] looking for the life.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't come to me to to give us the
[59:34] gift. He came to introduce Jesus Christ
[59:37] again to this to this age to this people
[59:41] to this end time bride. Introduce the
[59:44] life of God again to us
[59:48] &gt;&gt; now.
[59:50] Not not some kind of emotion. Not some
[59:52] kind of shout and dance and jump. All
[59:54] that's great. That's fine. Brother Brand
[59:56] had nothing against it. But that's not
[59:58] where our evidence lies.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. A peace surpasses all
[1:00:09] understanding.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't mean that it it's it's
[1:00:14] senseless, therefore impossible to
[1:00:15] understand. But what it means is it's
[1:00:18] beyond our ability to understand and
[1:00:21] even share and explain it sometimes by
[1:00:23] words. That's right. Right.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; A peace that passes understanding. It's
[1:00:28] not something that I can sit up here and
[1:00:31] give you a paragraph of words and then
[1:00:34] you say, "You got it."
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; The peace that passes all and you got to
[1:00:38] experience that for yourself.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. Did I Did I have
[1:00:54] this quote up about what he swore by
[1:00:56] himself?
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now by faith, uh, move right
[1:01:02] into this blood cell with the Lord Jesus
[1:01:05] where all these redemptive blessings are
[1:01:08] yours."
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're everyone a Christian,
[1:01:11] I presume. Then if you're a Christian,
[1:01:12] you have a right, a legal right to
[1:01:15] everything that Christ died for. It's
[1:01:18] your possession. You own it. It's yours.
[1:01:20] The only thing you had to do is do like
[1:01:23] Abraham. After he had endured a fight,
[1:01:26] he obtained the promise.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Satan just don't let you take it easy.
[1:01:31] You got to have faith. You got to
[1:01:33] believe. You got to endure.
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; You know, last night I I preached up at
[1:01:40] brother Paul's and I I preached a sermon
[1:01:42] on being bullied and I talked about how
[1:01:45] that uh we're sometimes we're victims
[1:01:47] and it's actually the devil that's the
[1:01:49] bully. You know, and I get tired I got
[1:01:51] tired of being bullied
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; by the devil.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you know, this is the
[1:02:01] thing I I was sharing with brother Paul.
[1:02:03] We were talking later and I said, you
[1:02:05] know, I said, you know, that interview
[1:02:06] that brother Brandon had with Sister
[1:02:07] Bruce. Now, I'm not here to talk about
[1:02:09] your mistakes and all that. That's a
[1:02:10] great message and I could I could preach
[1:02:12] that one to you, too. But but when I I'm
[1:02:14] here to point out one thing when she was
[1:02:16] pointing out to him said, "I make so
[1:02:17] many mistakes,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; right?" And that's what her evidence
[1:02:20] was. She didn't think she had the Holy
[1:02:22] Ghost.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, here's the phrase
[1:02:25] I want to get to. He says in there, he
[1:02:26] goes, "That's what he died for."
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Friends, when he died,
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; he actually brought into our possession.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Every redemptive promise was fulfilled
[1:02:42] there. All the fulfillment to bring
[1:02:44] every redemptive promise to his people
[1:02:47] was fulfilled right there with Jesus
[1:02:49] Christ.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And that's what brother Ramon is saying.
[1:02:53] It's yours. It belongs to you. Don't let
[1:02:55] the devil talk you out of it.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you, well, it
[1:02:59] was meant for you. God bless that
[1:03:01] brother testifying or that sister that's
[1:03:03] testifying so wonderful, but you know
[1:03:05] it's not really for you.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; No, it is for every child of God. Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And let me just drop this in. Don't let
[1:03:16] the devil try to tell you that you're
[1:03:18] not a child of God.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Friend, you know, I always said this
[1:03:22] when when when when I was growing up and
[1:03:25] a young teen, you know, and during the
[1:03:27] times I maybe was a rebellious and
[1:03:28] things, you know, I never in my life
[1:03:30] ever doubted that God had sent a
[1:03:32] prophet. I never questioned that. I
[1:03:35] never questioned whether this message
[1:03:37] was the truth or not. No, something I
[1:03:40] just knew it was. But you know, the
[1:03:42] thing that I questioned, Brother Wayne,
[1:03:44] was whether I was actually one of them.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Was I a part of it?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; You know, cuz Satan's always telling
[1:03:53] you, "Well, no, you you really are
[1:03:56] serpent seed. You really identify with
[1:03:57] Cain." No, you really identify with
[1:03:59] Esau.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; You're a Judas.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, let me just drop this in.
[1:04:06] Satan don't even know who his own kids
[1:04:08] are. So, how can he tell you?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; God actually knows by fornowledge. He
[1:04:16] knew you and he called you and he
[1:04:19] ordained you.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Satan don't even know his own kids.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Because of what happened back during the
[1:04:29] time of the book of Genesis, you know,
[1:04:31] the seed lines all got crossed.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Paul speaks about this in Romans. said,
[1:04:37] uh, was not Esau and Jacob born of the
[1:04:39] same parents.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And we know that Jacob was a child, a
[1:04:43] seed of God. He was a son of God. Esau
[1:04:46] sure was not.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; And God by his forn said, "Jacob have I
[1:04:53] love, and Esau I hate."
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, friends,
[1:05:02] don't let the devil tell you you don't
[1:05:03] belong or you're not God's children. You
[1:05:05] don't even know.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; So, don't listen to him. Listen to the
[1:05:08] one that actually knows.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, uh
[1:05:18] I'll share with you some about my my
[1:05:21] testimony. I uh about uh I see it was
[1:05:24] back in 2011.
[1:05:28] I started uh experiencing some real
[1:05:30] mental illness. And uh it started out
[1:05:34] real gradual, you know, and and there
[1:05:36] I'd get were times if nobody was at the
[1:05:39] house and I'd in the morning I it
[1:05:41] started out I wouldn't even get out of
[1:05:42] bed. I just lay there. Now I want you to
[1:05:45] know I was already pastoring a church
[1:05:46] down there in Dixon. I went down there
[1:05:48] actually in 1998.
[1:05:50] And so you know and so I I was just
[1:05:53] feeling so down and everything and then
[1:05:56] uh and so depressed. And this is the
[1:05:58] thing. It wasn't because there was bad
[1:06:00] things going on in my life. It wasn't
[1:06:02] because there was any stress. It wasn't
[1:06:03] because there was anything bad really
[1:06:05] going on or anything. And and so that's
[1:06:07] I didn't understand why am I feeling
[1:06:09] this way, you know, and and people talk
[1:06:11] to you and tell you, well, just don't
[1:06:13] think that way. Don't feel that way.
[1:06:14] Look, I I served five years in the army,
[1:06:16] so I know all about the mind games. And
[1:06:18] I know about all about that what, you
[1:06:20] know, that mind over matter they call
[1:06:22] it, you know, and and positive thinking
[1:06:24] and and you know, and and all those
[1:06:27] things about, you know, no pain, no gain
[1:06:28] and all that, you know, all the things
[1:06:30] that the army taught you, you know, and
[1:06:32] all that. But I'm going to tell you
[1:06:33] something, friends, that didn't work.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Faith is not positive thinking.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; It goes way beyond that.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; It surpasses all understanding. It
[1:06:48] surpasses actually all thinking, all
[1:06:50] reasoning.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And then, you know, it it began to just
[1:06:55] kept getting worse and worse on me. And
[1:06:58] then we actually had a a brother out of
[1:07:00] the church down there. He was actually
[1:07:02] going through some real mental battles
[1:07:04] at the time himself. And then on on the
[1:07:06] day he was supposed to get married, uh I
[1:07:09] got a call and he wasn't there at the
[1:07:11] church. And so I left the church and
[1:07:12] went to go to his house to find him and
[1:07:14] he had committed suicide, you know, and
[1:07:17] so I was the one that discovered the
[1:07:19] body and it was it I'll just tell you
[1:07:21] this, it was it's it's a horrific scene.
[1:07:23] All right? But I've never described it
[1:07:25] to anybody. I never will. But it but it
[1:07:28] it then it caused me to have like PTSD
[1:07:30] they call it.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And and I was uh then here I was already
[1:07:34] suffering from this mental illness which
[1:07:36] I'll explain a little bit what in in a
[1:07:38] minute. But, uh, I was already starting
[1:07:40] to suffer from that. And then I had
[1:07:42] this. It was like the I was standing on
[1:07:43] a cliff and this just pushed me off and
[1:07:46] and so I just started to plummet and it
[1:07:48] got bad. And so while I'm trying to deal
[1:07:50] with this depression and anxiety and
[1:07:52] things, then all of a sudden now I got
[1:07:54] this PTSD, PTSD, what it was, uh, you
[1:07:57] know, something would happen or
[1:07:58] whatever, you know, and and and and all
[1:08:00] of a sudden it it was like I I wasn't
[1:08:02] even there anymore and I was back at
[1:08:04] that scene and seeing everything. And
[1:08:06] and when that happens, you know,
[1:08:08] whatever that was going on in your body
[1:08:10] at that time, your your if your heart
[1:08:12] raised, your blood pressure raised and
[1:08:14] and all these your body starts going
[1:08:16] doing all that again.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Even though that it's not you're not
[1:08:20] there. That's what men that have been in
[1:08:22] AR in war and things like that that
[1:08:24] suffer from PTSD and things like that.
[1:08:26] It's what it is. they're back there
[1:08:28] again,
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; you know, and their body, their mind,
[1:08:33] everything just starts like going and
[1:08:35] and all the physical things,
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; and uh and so I was suffering from that.
[1:08:41] And so uh and then uh so then the next
[1:08:44] year would have been in June of 2012, my
[1:08:48] youngest son was going to get married.
[1:08:50] And so I I was supposed to be getting
[1:08:51] ready to go do the wedding and and uh so
[1:08:55] they were uh his wife was h they were
[1:08:58] having a wedding at her folks house
[1:08:59] lived out in the country, you know, and
[1:09:01] they were having a wedding outside
[1:09:02] there. And so I was at the house and I
[1:09:04] was starting to get ready and all of a
[1:09:05] sudden this anxiety hit me, Brother
[1:09:07] Wayne, and I started experiencing what I
[1:09:09] experienced on that day when when that
[1:09:11] other fellow was going to get married
[1:09:12] and and committed suicide. And and so
[1:09:14] then all these thoughts started flooding
[1:09:16] in. Your son's going to die. Your son's
[1:09:18] going to kill himself. and all don't
[1:09:19] make no sense,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; but but it was there, you know, and and
[1:09:25] I was experiencing this and it was just
[1:09:28] it was just tearing me up and and so I I
[1:09:31] I was asking the Lord to help me and I
[1:09:33] was trying to hold it together, you
[1:09:34] know, and I didn't tell my wife. I
[1:09:36] didn't tell my daughter or my sons or
[1:09:38] any of you. I didn't tell anybody about
[1:09:40] it. I'm just kind of holding it into
[1:09:42] myself. You know, that's it's a bad
[1:09:43] thing when you hold things into
[1:09:45] yourself.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; We need one another. That's right.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; We need support. We need prayer.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; You know, friends, look, I if if there's
[1:09:53] somebody that's reaching out to you that
[1:09:55] needs your support, don't try to fix
[1:09:56] them.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Just be there for them. Pray with them.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Let them know you're there for them.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm going to tell you this,
[1:10:05] sometimes you people always want to fix
[1:10:07] somebody if you don't got the answer.
[1:10:08] And sometimes there's not actually an
[1:10:11] immediate
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; resolution.
[1:10:15] Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Many times as preachers,
[1:10:17] we sit down and counsel with people as
[1:10:18] pastors and we want to figure it out and
[1:10:21] solve the thing right there. That ain't
[1:10:23] reality.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to endure.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the people have to go through
[1:10:32] things that they're going to have to
[1:10:33] endure.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; But this is the promise. You will come
[1:10:36] out of it on the other side.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; As Paul said, the Lord will deliver you
[1:10:41] out of them all. Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Well, a after that wedding and things
[1:10:46] things kept getting worse, you know,
[1:10:47] when the and the depression, I just I
[1:10:50] was feeling so down and depressed and
[1:10:51] like giving up and everything and like I
[1:10:53] said, it didn't make no sense to me
[1:10:55] because everything was actually going
[1:10:56] really good in my life and in the
[1:10:59] church. I mean, besides that that
[1:11:00] suicide, but everything else, you know,
[1:11:03] it was going well, especially in my
[1:11:05] family, you know, and and and so it made
[1:11:09] no sense. and and and so then the devil,
[1:11:12] you know, of course he come and try to
[1:11:13] tell me there's something wrong with
[1:11:14] you.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And then I I experiencing this anxiety
[1:11:20] when that would come on you these
[1:11:21] anxiety attacks, my wife actually begin
[1:11:23] to learn uh little signs, little ticks
[1:11:25] that I would have that she that I was
[1:11:27] getting ready to have an attack and she
[1:11:28] would say I'd always like begin to rub
[1:11:30] my temple right before they'd hit me and
[1:11:32] I didn't even realize I was doing it.
[1:11:34] And you know, and and she began to kind
[1:11:36] of educate herself on what was going on
[1:11:38] and things.
[1:11:39] uh when once she find but I finally I
[1:11:41] talked to my wife and my daughter and
[1:11:43] told them hey look this is what I'm
[1:11:44] going through my daughter my oldest
[1:11:46] daughter she's a nurse and she said
[1:11:48] daddy you got to go and talk to your
[1:11:49] primary physician and tell her what's
[1:11:52] going on so I did and I'll tell you this
[1:11:55] you know you think what you want about
[1:11:57] it you know and if you ever want to talk
[1:11:59] to me about it I I I'll be glad to talk
[1:12:00] to you about it but uh she started
[1:12:02] putting me on some medication for this
[1:12:04] depression and anxiety and things you
[1:12:06] know and I'll tell you something friends
[1:12:08] when you get so bad that that you you
[1:12:11] just and you start feeling like taking
[1:12:13] your own life, you know, you're willing
[1:12:15] for anything to give you some relief.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, over over the the period of
[1:12:23] years to to come, you know, it just kept
[1:12:25] getting worse. So, they she my doctor,
[1:12:27] you know, she done all she could,
[1:12:29] medication finally, she told me, she
[1:12:30] said, "Uh, look, Miss Brown, I've done
[1:12:32] all I can do for you. You it's surpassed
[1:12:34] my knowledge in in this." She says, 'I I
[1:12:37] really deal with the body, not actually
[1:12:39] the mind.' And she said, 'You need to go
[1:12:42] see a psychiatrist.' Now listen, let me
[1:12:44] tell you this. A lot of times people
[1:12:46] have this real stigma. They can
[1:12:48] understand somebody having diabetes,
[1:12:50] sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or
[1:12:52] or a heart condition that, but you get
[1:12:54] to talking about mental illness and
[1:12:55] mental things and that and some people
[1:12:57] got a stigma about it, you know, and and
[1:12:59] and and and you know, some say, "Well,
[1:13:03] if you got that, that means you ain't
[1:13:04] got the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:06] That is entirely wrong.
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I can tell you I can tell you from both
[1:13:13] from what I can tell you. Brother
[1:13:14] Brandham said, I can also tell you from
[1:13:16] experience.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this. He said a
[1:13:19] man could have a demon come. He says,
[1:13:22] and and torment him, he said, and get in
[1:13:26] his spirit realm and torment him. He
[1:13:28] said to where he would go completely
[1:13:30] insane. He said, but that ain't got a
[1:13:32] thing to do with that man's soul.
[1:13:34] Because friends, look, we are a three
[1:13:36] room uh uh unit here.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; The devil, he look, the only part that
[1:13:42] got the Holy Ghost was that inside of
[1:13:44] the inside, the soul.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You're living in a body that's not
[1:13:49] perfect. This body actually is the way
[1:13:52] it is still because of the fall.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Satan can affect you in this body.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Satan can get you all tore up in your
[1:14:02] spirit. You remember all the the five
[1:14:04] gates of the spirit brother talked
[1:14:06] about.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; So Satan can wreck havoc in there.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; He wrecks havoc in people's affections
[1:14:11] and emotions and and their memories and
[1:14:13] their imaginations and and reason. He he
[1:14:16] he just wrecks havoc in there.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; If you'll let him stay there.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Perry Green, I was talking to
[1:14:25] him one time. Brother Perry said, he
[1:14:28] said, you know, brother, he would talk
[1:14:29] to brother Brandham about he was having,
[1:14:31] he kept getting bad thoughts. You know,
[1:14:34] you probably heard brother Perry say he
[1:14:35] was getting bad thoughts and he felt
[1:14:37] real bad about it, especially being
[1:14:38] around the prophet. And he talked to
[1:14:39] brother Brandon about it and brother
[1:14:40] Brandon told him, he said, "Look, Eric,"
[1:14:42] he said, "It's just Satan putting them
[1:14:44] thoughts. It's not your thoughts." He
[1:14:46] said, "Listen, you can't stop the birds
[1:14:48] from flying over,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; but you don't have to let them nest."
[1:14:52] You know,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; so Satan can can shoot the thoughts
[1:14:55] there.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Don't dwell on them. Don't nest. Don't
[1:14:58] you Some people they invite him in for
[1:15:00] coffee.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Pull up a chair, devil.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Let's think about this a while. Don't
[1:15:07] think about it. Don't dwell on it.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Don't try to argue with him. Just ignore
[1:15:12] him.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; It got to a point where the medication
[1:15:19] won't be doing me no good no more. And
[1:15:21] and actually there's so many side
[1:15:22] effects, brother. I'll tell you this.
[1:15:24] I'll tell you this. Look, I'm not
[1:15:25] against people taking medication. All
[1:15:28] right? I'm not against if you got high
[1:15:30] blood pressure, sugar, diabetes, or you
[1:15:31] got mental health or heart condition,
[1:15:33] whatever it is. I'm not against Brother
[1:15:34] Brandham wasn't either.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that the knowledge
[1:15:37] that doctors have, God gave it to them
[1:15:39] to help poor suffering humanity.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not against that. But that's not
[1:15:44] your lot in life.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, pre. He didn't say, "I'm the
[1:15:49] Lord thy God that will make you take
[1:15:51] pills the rest of your life."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the Lord thy God that
[1:15:55] health."
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:15:57] [Music]
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; And David said, "He health health all of
[1:16:02] my diseases."
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; You know, people can believe for for for
[1:16:05] for physical illnesses,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; but it's just as real for mental
[1:16:09] illness.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; And this mental illness I'm talking look
[1:16:12] sometimes people they get down,
[1:16:14] depressed, you know, get down in their
[1:16:15] mind and everything because of stress.
[1:16:17] that's going on in their lives or or
[1:16:19] some bad problem or some bad trial
[1:16:22] they're going through.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; This wasn't that.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; And what I found out was that it's
[1:16:28] actually when you your your your your
[1:16:30] body is supposed to produce certain
[1:16:32] chemicals, and I won't name them all
[1:16:35] night, but one of them is actually
[1:16:36] serotonin. And it's supposed to produce
[1:16:38] those. And those are supposed to
[1:16:39] interact on your brain. Your brain needs
[1:16:41] chemicals
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; to to to think. And you know when people
[1:16:44] get Alzheimer's and or or dementia and
[1:16:48] all that, it's because something's going
[1:16:50] wrong with the what should be supplying
[1:16:52] them brain cells
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; and the brain cells start dying,
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; It's like like this. Let me explain it
[1:17:03] this way. Uh if you got diabetes, you
[1:17:06] know what it is? is your your body your
[1:17:09] pancreas is supposed to produce insulin
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; to break down the sugars in your blood.
[1:17:13] Now you got to have sugar in your body.
[1:17:15] Your brain actually won't function
[1:17:17] without you having some sugar in your
[1:17:18] blood.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; If a individual the sugar bottoms out
[1:17:22] and gets too low, you know, they could
[1:17:24] actually pass out,
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; You know, so we got to have it. But what
[1:17:29] happens is a person's body that their
[1:17:32] pancreas, it stops actually uh producing
[1:17:35] the insulin, right? And then many times
[1:17:38] there's things going on our bodies that
[1:17:39] makes us what they call insulin
[1:17:41] resistant. Even if your body is
[1:17:43] producing insulin, your body's being
[1:17:45] resistant to it and it's not having the
[1:17:47] effect and people's blood sugars too
[1:17:49] high.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Well, it's the same thing with with with
[1:17:54] this mental illness that I'm sharing
[1:17:55] with you. You know what happened was the
[1:17:58] chemicals are supposed to be produced to
[1:17:59] to actually act on the brain and the
[1:18:02] brain cells. My my body wasn't producing
[1:18:04] them.
[1:18:05] And so that's why I was feeling
[1:18:07] depressed over nothing.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; It didn't make any sense. And it wasn't
[1:18:13] that something was going on. It's
[1:18:14] because it wasn't operating right.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, it got so
[1:18:18] bad that during I think it was maybe uh
[1:18:22] 2016,
[1:18:23] I believe. Uh I got to a point I think
[1:18:26] for about a month, month and a half, I
[1:18:28] couldn't even preach. It got to a place,
[1:18:30] friends. And I'll tell you what, I was
[1:18:32] uh, you know, any of the brothers that
[1:18:34] preach can tell you, you know, uh, until
[1:18:36] God gives you an inspiration, you can
[1:18:39] sit down and read and study and read the
[1:18:41] Bible and everything else, but until God
[1:18:42] gives an inspiration to you,
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; you know, maybe you see a cigarette pack
[1:18:46] laying on out in the woods, it says uh,
[1:18:49] a thinking man's filter,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; a smoking man's taste, you know, maybe
[1:18:54] you see something like that and it's
[1:18:55] just the inspiration that comes and when
[1:18:57] that inspiration hits, then it all
[1:18:59] starts coming. I wasn't getting no
[1:19:00] inspiration. I could study. I could
[1:19:03] read. I could try. Nothing was coming.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And and and I had so much anxiety on me.
[1:19:10] I got nervous being around people. I got
[1:19:13] the world. Couldn't even counsel the
[1:19:14] people in my church with their problems
[1:19:16] and things cuz I was so tore up.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And so I had a brother in my church. He
[1:19:21] he he actually preached for me for
[1:19:22] whatever that span was a month, month
[1:19:24] and a half or whatever, you know. And of
[1:19:26] course, I can tell you this, that
[1:19:27] church's faith was tested,
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; you know, and I also tell you this, I
[1:19:31] really wasn't sharing with them what was
[1:19:33] going on with me.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because Satan makes you
[1:19:38] embarrassed.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; And and Satan was telling me, you know
[1:19:41] what? Something's wrong with you.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; You know, that's why you can't get
[1:19:46] anointed. That's why you can't feel it.
[1:19:47] That's why you can't get inspired.
[1:19:49] That's why you can't preach. Something's
[1:19:51] wrong with you. Amen. Now,
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; I had a very good friend, Brother Wayne
[1:19:54] knows him, Brother Boatens, out in West
[1:19:56] Tennessee. And he he's very good friend
[1:19:58] of mine, ever since I moved down there.
[1:20:01] And I actually withdrawal from
[1:20:02] everybody. I wouldn't go visit no
[1:20:05] churches. I wouldn't talk to nobody. I
[1:20:07] wouldn't visit nobody. I just withdraw.
[1:20:09] Many times, even at the house of my
[1:20:11] family, I'd go off to myself in a room
[1:20:12] and shut the door. and and and and and
[1:20:16] so uh you know, brother but brother Bo,
[1:20:20] he he wouldn't leave me alone.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; He just kept calling me
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; and he'd check on me. Now, he never
[1:20:28] tried to fix me,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; but he would talk to me about what was
[1:20:30] going on, you know, and he would try to
[1:20:32] share from his own experiences and and
[1:20:34] and he would say, "I'm praying for you,
[1:20:36] brother." And then I'd say, "Brother Bo,
[1:20:37] can you come see me?" And he said, "I'll
[1:20:38] be over." So, Brother Bo would come over
[1:20:40] to see me. And one time I was really
[1:20:42] going through it, the devil's saying,
[1:20:43] "You don't got the Holy Ghost. You know,
[1:20:45] something's really bad wrong with you.
[1:20:47] Look at the thoughts going through your
[1:20:48] head, how you're feeling, everything
[1:20:50] else. It's over for you.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; God's done with you."
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And friends, I'll tell you what, by the
[1:20:56] time he got done, I didn't even feel
[1:20:57] like a Christian anymore.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Said, "You ain't got no faith. You ain't
[1:21:01] got nothing."
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And so, so I I asked Brother Bo, I said,
[1:21:05] "Brother Bo, can you come over and visit
[1:21:07] and preach?" And I said, "And pray for
[1:21:08] me. Lay hands on me." So he came over
[1:21:11] and uh and he preached. I can't even
[1:21:13] tell you what he preached on. I was so
[1:21:15] tore up. But he preached and when he got
[1:21:17] done preaching, my I was sitting with my
[1:21:19] wife and I told my wife, I said, "Help
[1:21:21] me get up there." I said, "Help me get
[1:21:23] up there." She took hold my arm and she
[1:21:24] helped me get up the aisle to get up
[1:21:26] there to the front. You know, sometimes
[1:21:27] you feel like you couldn't hardly move
[1:21:28] and get around.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; And and she got me up here to the front
[1:21:31] and brother Bo come down. He laid hands
[1:21:33] on me. He started praying for me. And I
[1:21:34] tell you what, friends, next thing I
[1:21:35] knew, I was in the floor.
[1:21:38] And and brother Bo told me he told the
[1:21:40] people don't worry that's just the
[1:21:41] spirit of God spell. He said that's the
[1:21:44] power of God said he just slayed him in
[1:21:45] the spirit. You know
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; y'all might think all that God don't do
[1:21:48] that. That's Pentecostalism.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Well you know what they were all in one
[1:21:53] accord in the upper room on the day of
[1:21:55] Pentecost.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:59] But but I'll tell you what friends. Did
[1:22:01] I get healed? Did I get delivered? No.
[1:22:04] But I'll tell you what happened that
[1:22:06] day. It defeated the enemy who was
[1:22:08] putting all them thoughts in my head
[1:22:10] that that I God was done with me and I
[1:22:13] had no faith and I couldn't believe and
[1:22:15] God didn't care about me.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something. God cares
[1:22:20] about you.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Bispell say one time he
[1:22:25] said God cares so much about you he
[1:22:27] cares what you ate for breakfast this
[1:22:29] morning. Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He There is nothing too small in your
[1:22:34] life that God says, "Well, that's
[1:22:35] insignificant. I don't really care about
[1:22:37] that."
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; After that, I thought, "Well, I don't
[1:22:49] know what I'm going to do. I I if I'm
[1:22:50] going to lose it all if I don't get up
[1:22:52] and start preaching again." So, so I got
[1:22:54] up and I couldn't, like I told you, I
[1:22:56] couldn't get inspired. I couldn't get
[1:22:57] anything new or whatever. So, I just
[1:22:59] went and dug out old notes and I and
[1:23:01] back then it wasn't things like this. It
[1:23:03] was paper. And so, I I dug out old
[1:23:06] notes, you know, and I I brought them up
[1:23:08] there and and and even with that,
[1:23:10] because the medication I was on,
[1:23:12] friends, it got me to a place where I
[1:23:14] was numb.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; You know, and and I couldn't feel
[1:23:17] anything. If you done something that
[1:23:18] would have normally upset me, I didn't I
[1:23:21] couldn't even feel upset.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; You know, if you done something that
[1:23:24] should have made me happy, I couldn't
[1:23:26] even feel happy. if it was something I
[1:23:28] should have got excited about. I
[1:23:29] couldn't even feel that.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; I just numb.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; So, I'd stand up there and many times
[1:23:35] what I did was I just read off them
[1:23:37] papers.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; You know, and uh then uh you know, I I
[1:23:43] started telling my brother, I said, "I
[1:23:45] can't feel anything." And he he's he and
[1:23:47] telling him now that. So then uh I went
[1:23:50] to the Philippines 2017 and and brother
[1:23:53] Roy Roel Soraniano and brother Landland
[1:23:55] uh they both of them brothers saw me I
[1:23:57] preached a camp down at brother
[1:23:59] landllands and then went up and preached
[1:24:00] a uh special meetings with brother
[1:24:03] Soraniano with my brother but they when
[1:24:07] the first time they heard me brother
[1:24:08] lands they said man you're different
[1:24:09] than you were 20 years ago
[1:24:12] what happened to you and they were they
[1:24:13] were trying and well it made me feel bad
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; so when I got over to brother Oel's you
[1:24:18] know, was going to speak. They have the
[1:24:20] November one meetings he did back then.
[1:24:22] And so, uh, so I I was going to speak
[1:24:25] over there. So, I thought, well, let me
[1:24:27] just act excited.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And my brother told me, "Oh, don't tell
[1:24:35] me you don't you I saw you acting." I
[1:24:37] said, "It was an act." I said, "You know
[1:24:40] what happens, friends? You're so
[1:24:41] embarrassed, you feel so bad, you try to
[1:24:43] hide it from everybody."
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil wants to do. He
[1:24:47] wants to get you off away from
[1:24:48] everybody.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Get you off from the herd, so to speak,
[1:24:52] you know, get you out there alone, a
[1:24:54] lone deer on its own,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; where you become vulnerable.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; And where he can attack you and friends,
[1:25:01] he can just hammer your mind if you
[1:25:03] ain't got nobody else there to say,
[1:25:05] "Look, point you back to the word of
[1:25:07] God."
[1:25:12] Then
[1:25:14] now I know you might not like this part
[1:25:16] of my testimony but then I I got to
[1:25:19] thinking you know what I have gained so
[1:25:20] much weight because what I did was I
[1:25:24] I for comfort I ate. Some people they
[1:25:27] get like this with that mental illness
[1:25:28] and they don't eat and they just lose a
[1:25:30] bunch of weight. Unfortunately that was
[1:25:32] not me.
[1:25:36] I stand before you today. I've lost 80
[1:25:39] pounds from where I where I started this
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; you know and I'm not done yet.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; But what I started to do was friends I
[1:25:46] started to to to to go to the the
[1:25:49] hospital where I visit Vanderbilt there
[1:25:50] in Nashville and they started helping
[1:25:52] with with guided with nutrition and
[1:25:54] different things and to lose weight and
[1:25:57] and I started walking.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; And and and I I got this thing, you
[1:26:03] know, I guess maybe from being in the
[1:26:04] military and everything. I I get like
[1:26:06] all in on stuff sometimes. So there was
[1:26:08] times I was walking 10 miles every
[1:26:10] morning.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; About killing myself,
[1:26:14] you know, and so I started to lose the
[1:26:17] weight and different things like that.
[1:26:18] And I started going back to the
[1:26:20] psychiatrist, you know, and I said,
[1:26:21] "Hey, look, you need to take I hate this
[1:26:23] stuff. You got to start taking me off
[1:26:25] this medicine." And he'd say, "Well, are
[1:26:26] you feeling this? Are are you thinking
[1:26:28] this way anymore?" I said, "No, I'm not
[1:26:29] thinking that way no more. Praise God.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Take me off this stuff."
[1:26:34] I just started claiming it, friends.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; No, no. He said, "Are you having
[1:26:38] suicidal thoughts?" Nope, I'm not.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; The devil. He is, but I'm not.
[1:26:49] And so they started kind of, they say
[1:26:51] they can't just take you off those meds
[1:26:53] all at once. They say they got to walk
[1:26:55] you down, wing you off, you know. So
[1:26:56] they started doing that. And so then uh
[1:26:59] uh September of two of 2023,
[1:27:02] you know, I I got off I was only on
[1:27:04] maybe two or three medicines of of all
[1:27:07] the medications they had me on. And so I
[1:27:09] I I began to preach a message and just
[1:27:11] sharing about faith and believing God.
[1:27:14] And so at the end of it, I gave a
[1:27:15] testimony and I said I said, "Listen, I
[1:27:18] said God has healed me."
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And I said, "And and I've went off a lot
[1:27:23] of this medicine." I said, "But starting
[1:27:24] today, I ain't taking no more of it."
[1:27:27] I said, I I'm I'm I'm done.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; I said, I believe God's healed me.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And so I went out to go home and that,
[1:27:37] you know, it was on a Sunday that night
[1:27:39] and went to go to bed. Now, I tell you
[1:27:41] this, uh to make a point, I I sleep with
[1:27:43] a CPAT machine. If you don't know what
[1:27:45] that is, somebody's got sleep apnea,
[1:27:47] they stop breathing while they're
[1:27:48] sleeping. And so this this CPAP, you
[1:27:51] sleep with a mask on and and it just
[1:27:52] blows air in your face continuously to
[1:27:55] keep you breathing. And and so I put
[1:27:58] that mask on. It was blowing air in my
[1:28:00] face. And I went to lay down on the bed.
[1:28:02] And when I did, friends, I all of a
[1:28:04] sudden it was like a big old heavy
[1:28:06] weight came down, rested on top of my
[1:28:09] chest, crushing me. And and and and and
[1:28:12] I can't breathe. And I started gasping
[1:28:14] and gasping for air. and and I nudged my
[1:28:16] wife and I jumped up out of bed and she
[1:28:18] said, "What's going on?" I said, "I
[1:28:19] can't breathe." I said, "Something's
[1:28:21] crushing me." I said, "I can't breathe.
[1:28:23] I can't breathe." I said, "I know it's
[1:28:24] the devil cuz what I testified."
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Put your hands on me. Pray
[1:28:29] for me."
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; So, she prayed for me. You know, he
[1:28:32] didn't let up. I'll tell you what,
[1:28:34] friends, I didn't get no sleep that
[1:28:35] night. Every time I tried to lay down,
[1:28:37] it just would attack me.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And so, I went through that for about
[1:28:41] three nights in a row.
[1:28:44] And finally, you know, finally, I think
[1:28:46] it was about maybe around Friday or so
[1:28:48] that I I text my mom. You know, I got a
[1:28:50] lot of confidence in my mom. And I text
[1:28:53] my mom and I said, "Mom, you need to
[1:28:55] pray for me." And I started telling her
[1:28:56] what I was going through, what was
[1:28:58] happening to me. And I said, "I'm under
[1:28:59] attack here." And I said, and and and it
[1:29:03] it's real. I said, "There is something
[1:29:05] crushing my chest." And I said, "And I
[1:29:08] was sitting on the couch in living room
[1:29:10] gasping for air. my wife sitting there
[1:29:12] by me and I said, "You need to pray for
[1:29:14] me. Please pray for me." And so my
[1:29:17] brother, he was out, he was actually out
[1:29:19] having a special meeting somewhere. And
[1:29:20] so she text him right away and told him
[1:29:23] what was going on. So he sent back a
[1:29:25] quote that he sent my mom. It was
[1:29:27] brother Brandham talking about he was
[1:29:29] dealing with this woman he'd prayed for
[1:29:30] that had cancer and she got worse and
[1:29:33] she got more sick. And brother Brandham
[1:29:35] sent word to her said, "You tell her
[1:29:37] that is the best sign in the world that
[1:29:40] God has healed her." And friends, when I
[1:29:43] read that, I jumped up from that couch.
[1:29:46] I ran into my office. I grabbed out my
[1:29:48] computer, brought it out there cuz I'm
[1:29:50] I'm a felony that just kind of likes to
[1:29:51] read the paragraph before and the
[1:29:53] paragraph after just to make sure I got
[1:29:55] it all, you know? And so I went and got
[1:29:57] it and opened it up and I read all that
[1:29:58] and I sat there on that couch and when I
[1:30:00] read that, friends, that weight left me.
[1:30:04] Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; I stopped gasping for air. I could
[1:30:10] breathe again. It was gone.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] And I sat there, friend. And I'll tell
[1:30:20] you what, I was so happy. Tears were
[1:30:22] just rolling down my face.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; And you know what? That was Satan's last
[1:30:32] ditch attempt at me.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; I ain't never suffered from any of it
[1:30:38] ever again.
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:56] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you
[1:30:59] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:31:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:05] Hallelujah.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Friends, I tell you what,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I endured that for 12 long years.
[1:31:16] You think about getting discouraged and
[1:31:17] feeling like you ain't going to get
[1:31:19] healed.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; This is just how it's going to be. And
[1:31:22] you know, and Satan, of course, you
[1:31:23] know, when you go into a doctor, brother
[1:31:25] Wayne, for like for for physical things,
[1:31:27] they say, "Uh, has your daddy ever had a
[1:31:30] heart condition? Has your uncle, has
[1:31:32] your brother, has your mom, you know,
[1:31:34] has your grandfather, you know, they do
[1:31:36] the same thing when you're going for
[1:31:37] mental illness?"
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; They do the same thing. They ask you,
[1:31:41] "Well, brother, I I got relatives that
[1:31:44] have suffered mental illness,
[1:31:47] you know, and and so, you know, then the
[1:31:49] devil works that on your mind." See,
[1:31:51] it's genetically inherited.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I might have been genetically
[1:31:57] predisposed to have the chemicals to
[1:31:59] stop working right in my mind. But
[1:32:01] that's just in my body. The part that
[1:32:03] came from heaven, the part that came
[1:32:05] from God, it ain't got no part with
[1:32:07] that.
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:12] I realize that Satan, he can't touch me.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; He might be able to touch my body. He
[1:32:18] might be able to touch my spirit. But
[1:32:20] brother Bam said, "You look at me, you
[1:32:22] don't even see me."
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you this, friends. You
[1:32:26] look at me and you see a a a heavy set
[1:32:29] fell with bald hair.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; I look and I see this skinny fella about
[1:32:35] 145 lbs with blonde hair.
[1:32:38] You remembering Mishi?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Thick head full of hair. I was proud of
[1:32:48] it, too.
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:53] First time my wife met me, she said, "I
[1:32:55] never seen nobody couldn't walk past
[1:32:57] their reflection without combing their
[1:32:59] hair."
[1:33:05] Friends, look, I I have dreams that I
[1:33:09] wake up to go clean up at the sink in
[1:33:10] the morning and look up in the mirror
[1:33:12] and I'm a young man again. I'm going to
[1:33:13] tell you something. It might be seem
[1:33:15] like it's just a dream, but to me, it's
[1:33:17] going to be a reality.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; There's a part of me that Satan can't
[1:33:22] touch.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And I got news for you, brother Wayne.
[1:33:26] I'm starting to feel like shouting now.
[1:33:27] I got news for you. We're coming down to
[1:33:29] a time, friends, of the millennium where
[1:33:31] it said he'll be bound for a thousand
[1:33:33] years.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Brother said it ain't with the logging
[1:33:36] chain. It's a chain of circumstance. And
[1:33:38] they said the circumstance is you're not
[1:33:40] going to be in this fallen conditioned
[1:33:42] flesh anymore. You're going to be in a
[1:33:45] glorified body. Amen. That that's
[1:33:47] wrapped around a theophony that has the
[1:33:50] real you living on the inside.
[1:34:00] Hallelujah. I tell you what, he has
[1:34:02] bullied me and and pushed me and
[1:34:05] tormented me so much, friends, I'll be
[1:34:07] glad to torment him during that time.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; I want to be like Elijah was with the
[1:34:14] the prophets of Baal. Maybe you God
[1:34:17] can't hear you. Maybe you need to shout
[1:34:19] louder. Or maybe he's on vacation. He
[1:34:20] torment them into them men. He taunted
[1:34:22] them.
[1:34:24] That's right.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie said, he said, "You know,
[1:34:28] the Bible says that the the the devil's
[1:34:30] going to get kicked into the pit." He
[1:34:32] says, "I'd like it to be my foot."
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Look, we don't got to be tormented by
[1:34:41] the devil. We don't got to put up with
[1:34:42] it.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, friends, why
[1:34:45] does God have us endure things? Because
[1:34:48] there's going to be some growth
[1:34:49] happening you.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you this, friend.
[1:34:54] Now, God has not only restored me,
[1:34:57] hallelujah, mentally, he's not only
[1:34:59] restored me physically, but friends,
[1:35:01] I'll tell you what, I've come back
[1:35:03] stronger than I ever was.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz during that 12 years
[1:35:08] of affliction, God just kept revealing
[1:35:11] faith to me.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this. I said it, brother
[1:35:17] Paul, first time I ever said it before.
[1:35:19] you know, just the spirit of God came on
[1:35:21] me and I said, you know, the devil had
[1:35:22] me so scared of him. But I'm going to
[1:35:24] tell you something now, friends. I
[1:35:25] believe that God's gave me a testimony
[1:35:27] and experience that the devil is afraid
[1:35:30] of me.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because there's people,
[1:35:33] listen, friends, talk to pastors, talk
[1:35:35] to churches, talk to the people who
[1:35:37] preach at the youth camps, and you'll
[1:35:38] find out that there's people everywhere,
[1:35:40] even young people, suffering from mental
[1:35:42] illness.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; It's like an epidemic.
[1:35:47] Right.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; And and you know what the hindrance is
[1:35:52] to a lot of them is people tell them
[1:35:54] just don't think that way.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; If you just really had faith and believe
[1:35:58] God, you you wouldn't be thinking that.
[1:36:00] You wouldn't have that mental illness.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Shame on them.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Pray for them people. Help them people.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, I I believe
[1:36:19] friends, look, I am happy to have
[1:36:23] endured it.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; If there is something that God can do
[1:36:29] from my life and my experience and my
[1:36:31] testimony, which friends, look, I'm not
[1:36:33] I I am not shy to tell you I ain't
[1:36:36] superhuman.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; I ain't shy to tell you I'm flesh and
[1:36:41] blood just like you are.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; I have trials just like you do.
[1:36:49] But if God from that experience that he
[1:36:52] had me endure,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; if somehow it can help lead others to
[1:36:58] believe and grasp by faith and get
[1:37:01] healed and delivered, cuz I'm telling
[1:37:04] you something, friends, God wants to
[1:37:06] heal you.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; He came, he died to heal us. He died to
[1:37:12] deliver us. He died to set us free. Not
[1:37:16] just from the spirits of physical
[1:37:18] disease, but every all diseases.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Everything you got going on in your
[1:37:26] life.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; If you're going through a trial,
[1:37:29] friends, don't let that drag you down.
[1:37:31] And you say, "Well, it's going on for a
[1:37:33] while. God's just going to get great
[1:37:35] glory from it."
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; 400 years.
[1:37:44] Israel was down in Egypt.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; God gave Abraham a promise and he said,
[1:37:49] "After 400 years, I'll bring them back
[1:37:51] and I'm going to give them this land."
[1:37:53] He said, "But I can't do it right now
[1:37:54] because of the cup of iniquity of the
[1:37:57] Amorites ain't full yet."
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I'm going to bring them
[1:38:03] back." 400 years went past.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then God was ready to
[1:38:08] deliver and they weren't ready to be
[1:38:10] delivered.
[1:38:12] So Moses had to leave and go out in the
[1:38:14] in the wilderness because we know what
[1:38:16] he' done and you know he tried to take
[1:38:17] it in his own hands. We know all about
[1:38:18] that. But brother Ram says this. He said
[1:38:20] God was ready to deliver them people
[1:38:22] right then. He said but they wasn't
[1:38:23] ready. He said so Moses left and it was
[1:38:26] another 40 years.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Endure.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Don't let go. Don't look at reason.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Don't look at nothing the devil tells
[1:38:43] you. Don't think well you know my
[1:38:45] genetics my family whatever that look
[1:38:47] that look this that ain't your family
[1:38:49] like brother Brandham said he come to
[1:38:51] the revelation I am not the son of
[1:38:53] Charles and Ella Brandom. I am a son of
[1:38:55] God and that's what you are tonight. You
[1:38:58] are sons and daughters of God. Come on
[1:39:00] now.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; This this flesh body that you live in,
[1:39:05] it might have inherited things from your
[1:39:07] uh natural father and mother here on
[1:39:10] this earth, but the real you that's on
[1:39:12] the inside didn't come from them.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; It come from God. I come from God and I
[1:39:18] go back to God.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; I got a revelation of predestination.
[1:39:26] Yes.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; I got a revelation who my father is.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; It tells me where I came from and it
[1:39:32] tells me where I'm going.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. I'm just passing
[1:39:38] through here.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I come from a a supernatural
[1:39:44] heavenly place. I was in the mind of
[1:39:45] God. I was in his thoughts.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Before the world was ever even created.
[1:39:51] Amen.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; God thought about me before he thought
[1:39:56] about making this earth.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I love that song. When he was on the
[1:40:01] cross,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; I was on his mind.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. 2,000 plus years ago when
[1:40:10] he was dying on the cross, of course,
[1:40:12] Peter and all the rest of them, they
[1:40:13] were all around and all that, you know,
[1:40:14] and everything. And and of course, you
[1:40:16] know, Brother Bam said it was a hard
[1:40:17] thing for Jesus in the garden because he
[1:40:19] had to come down and conquer his flesh
[1:40:21] and leave his disciples.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; You know, but I'll tell you what, when
[1:40:25] he was dying, friends, you were on his
[1:40:27] mind.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Your great great great granddaddy didn't
[1:40:31] even exist yet,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; but you were on his mind.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; He was dying for you.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He He didn't just die for
[1:40:42] the guy or the the the the sister next
[1:40:44] to you. He died for you.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And all the redemptive promises
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; that that is now yours under that. Amen.
[1:40:52] How many How many says, "I believe."
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Friends, look, we can this this is a
[1:41:01] strange thing. Brother Brandham said, I
[1:41:02] let me just drop this and I'll close.
[1:41:04] Brother talking about enduring. Brother
[1:41:05] Brandham gave a testimony. He was he was
[1:41:07] saying that he said, "I prayed for
[1:41:09] people." He said he was talking about
[1:41:10] him having that real bad stomach issue
[1:41:12] and all that, you know, and he says,
[1:41:14] "I've prayed for people that had far
[1:41:15] worse diseases than what I've got." He
[1:41:18] says, "And and God healed them through
[1:41:20] that prayer." He said, "And there I was
[1:41:21] standing there suffering with that." And
[1:41:23] he said he suffered with for years. And
[1:41:25] when he was given this one particular
[1:41:27] word about it and testimony, he told
[1:41:28] him, "I'm still suffering from it. I'll
[1:41:30] get back to you and let you know when
[1:41:32] I'm healed."
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; He had to endure.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Right? That's right.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Brother said if you want your prayers to
[1:41:42] be successful, he says put yourself in
[1:41:44] that person's shoes that you're praying
[1:41:46] for.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; You know, I I back in 2017, I was still
[1:41:53] suffering real bad and I come up to my
[1:41:54] brothers and he just wouldn't let me get
[1:41:56] by. He just kept forcing me to speak.
[1:41:58] And so I had this little message. I
[1:42:01] think it was one of my first little
[1:42:02] inspirations, you know, coming out of
[1:42:03] this. And and and I preach on midnight
[1:42:06] what I called it. and about darkness in
[1:42:09] your life, you know, and and and there
[1:42:11] was a a young sister that was there in
[1:42:14] that meeting and and she had just
[1:42:16] recently been put on medication and she
[1:42:18] was going through this mental illness.
[1:42:19] And so she came up to the front, you
[1:42:21] know, and she said, "Brother Jerry, can
[1:42:23] you pray for me and this is what I'm
[1:42:25] suffering with?" Friends, I stood there
[1:42:27] and I, you know, I was like, "Man,
[1:42:28] that's what I'm suffering with."
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; And so, but I I prayed for her, you
[1:42:32] know, you know, and then I got the
[1:42:33] testimony back. God healed her right
[1:42:36] there.
[1:42:45] And I went out of there and went home to
[1:42:46] Tennessee still
[1:42:49] afflicted.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Wow. Then then you know few months later
[1:42:55] after that my brother and I we we went I
[1:42:58] think it was then maybe it was 2019 but
[1:43:00] anyway we went over to the Philippines
[1:43:01] together and uh we after uh we yeah it
[1:43:05] must have been 2019 we had preached this
[1:43:06] youth camp and we was preaching this
[1:43:08] youth uh like retreat that brother
[1:43:10] Sorano had and then they had a questions
[1:43:13] and answer service and it turns out
[1:43:15] there was uh some young sister there I
[1:43:17] guess was uh somebody started asking the
[1:43:19] questions for her she didn't ask the
[1:43:21] question somebody else, a friend was
[1:43:22] asking the questions for and they were
[1:43:24] asking and it had to deal with mental
[1:43:26] health and so my brother turned to me
[1:43:28] and he said, "Jerry, won't you take this
[1:43:30] one?" And so, uh, you know, I I talked
[1:43:32] to the young people for a little bit,
[1:43:34] you know, on that. And then, uh, this
[1:43:36] the last service was over and then, uh,
[1:43:39] I that that Sunday morning, uh, they
[1:43:42] took my brother and he went to one
[1:43:43] church to preach and and then he get the
[1:43:45] associate pastor. He's actually the
[1:43:47] pastor there now, Brother Boyd. and and
[1:43:49] they he took me and went to this little
[1:43:50] village, you know, and we went to this
[1:43:53] little village, you know, and I went
[1:43:54] into this little humble little ch church
[1:43:56] to preach, you know, and I preached, you
[1:43:58] know, and and and then we had somebody
[1:44:01] that wanted to be baptized after. So, we
[1:44:03] we baptized them and and then uh after
[1:44:05] that, they were having some testimonies
[1:44:07] and here's this young lady that had been
[1:44:09] in those meetings. She comes up, she
[1:44:11] says, "I got a testimony to give."
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; And she said, "I was in those meetings."
[1:44:15] And she said, "I was suffering from
[1:44:17] mental illness, from depression. I
[1:44:18] wanted to take my life." She said, she
[1:44:20] says, "And brother Jerry just talked to
[1:44:22] me." She says, "And it changed my life.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I didn't even know I was talking to
[1:44:29] her." Her friend was the one that asked
[1:44:30] the questions.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; But I but I looked at friends and I
[1:44:34] thought, Lord, I was like, "Brother
[1:44:36] Brandon, here these people are getting
[1:44:38] healed from this very same thing I'm I'm
[1:44:40] suffering from and I'm still suffering."
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, friend.
[1:44:46] I'm happy that I suffered. I'm happy
[1:44:48] that I endured. I'm happy to do it.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; If God can somehow just be a blessing to
[1:44:57] you.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; My life, my experience, my can just
[1:45:01] somehow be a blessing to you and help
[1:45:02] you.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, friends. Look, if
[1:45:08] you're suffering, and I'm not going to
[1:45:09] embarrass anybody, but there was someone
[1:45:11] that that that sent word to me said,
[1:45:13] "Pray for them." you know that they were
[1:45:14] suffering from mental illness and that.
[1:45:16] And I'll tell you this, friends, I find
[1:45:18] out their name. I got up every morning
[1:45:20] and and I still do. I get up at night
[1:45:21] and I call their name out in prayer. I
[1:45:24] pray, God, help them get up today. Help
[1:45:27] them get out of bed. Help them make it
[1:45:29] through the day, Lord. Help them eat
[1:45:30] breakfast. Bless their food, Lord. I I
[1:45:33] pray you heal them, God. Heal them. But
[1:45:35] until you do, Lord, help her help them
[1:45:37] through this day, you know, and then
[1:45:38] then at lunchtime, Lord, bless her food.
[1:45:40] Help them through. Help help this person
[1:45:42] through, you know, and and then and then
[1:45:44] the bedtime, Lord. Help them to get some
[1:45:46] rest in their body now. Help them be
[1:45:47] able to go to sleep, Lord. Cuz you know
[1:45:49] what it is, friends? I know what it's
[1:45:50] like to endure
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; day in and day out.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this,
[1:45:58] God is going to heal them.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when when when God
[1:46:06] brings that healing, you are you are
[1:46:08] actually stronger for it and the devil's
[1:46:11] weaker.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, I'm here
[1:46:17] tonight to say boo back to the devil.
[1:46:19] Amen. Let's stand.
[1:46:22] Hallelujah.
[1:46:27] Hallelujah.
[1:46:29] Hallelujah.
[1:46:32] Heavenly Father, Lord, I thank you
[1:46:35] tonight, Lord. I God, I I felt on my
[1:46:38] heart. I didn't really know how know how
[1:46:40] to share it. Lord,
[1:46:43] Lord, we just want to be a help, God. I
[1:46:45] pray you know everyone here. You know
[1:46:46] what they're suffering with. You know
[1:46:48] what? how if Satan is afflicting them,
[1:46:50] whatever it is, whether it's physical,
[1:46:52] whether it's mental, whether it's some
[1:46:54] type of a trial or issue that's going on
[1:46:56] in their life, their family, or
[1:46:58] whatever, Lord, you you're here tonight,
[1:47:00] Lord, to bring them the answer, dear
[1:47:02] God. And that answer, Lord, is just hold
[1:47:04] fast.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Don't let go.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Hold fast in faith, God. The answer's on
[1:47:11] the way, God. One time God Daniel prayed
[1:47:15] and and and asked you Lord. And God he
[1:47:17] he waited I think it was 40 days waiting
[1:47:20] for you to answer Lord. Finally an angel
[1:47:22] comes through and said God heard you the
[1:47:25] first day Daniel. And he sent an angel.
[1:47:28] He sent me from the from his presence to
[1:47:30] come tell you. But then I was beset by
[1:47:32] the prince of Persia and he had to send
[1:47:35] Michael down with the angels to fight
[1:47:37] and make a hole through for me to get to
[1:47:39] you. Sometimes, Lord, Lord, that's what
[1:47:42] it is, Lord. That we wrestle not against
[1:47:45] flesh and blood, but against
[1:47:47] principalities and and powers and rulers
[1:47:50] in high places and darkness.
[1:47:53] But Lord, you have empowered us. You've
[1:47:55] gave us the the the most powerful weapon
[1:47:58] in the world, prayer.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; It changes things.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And Lord, if we can pray, Lord, and just
[1:48:06] believe it and commit it to you, Lord,
[1:48:08] it will happen.
[1:48:10] because you said whatever you ask that
[1:48:13] you would give it to us, Lord.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:17] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Bless your
[1:48:19] people tonight, dear God. We ask it for
[1:48:23] your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:30] Hallelujah. I'm not on
[1:48:33] an ego
[1:48:35] trip.
[1:48:37] I'm nothing.
[1:48:39] on
[1:48:41] my own.
[1:48:46] I make mistakes
[1:48:49] and often
[1:48:51] sl
[1:48:54] just come in flesh
[1:48:57] and bone.
[1:49:01] But I'll prove
[1:49:03] someday
[1:49:06] just what I say.
[1:49:10] I'm of a special
[1:49:14] kind
[1:49:17] when he
[1:49:19] was on

[2:13:14] way.

[2:13:24] [Music]
[2:13:29] You are worthy.
[2:13:37] You are.

[2:13:50] [Music]
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; My redeemer
[2:13:55] is faithful
[2:13:58] and true.
[2:14:02] Everything
[2:14:04] he has said
[2:14:07] he will do.
[2:14:13] Every morning
[2:14:16] his mercies
[2:14:19] are new.
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:24] My redeemer
[2:14:26] [Music]
[2:14:27] is faithful
[2:14:30] and true.
[2:14:34] Oh, my redeemer
[2:14:38] is faithful
[2:14:41] and true.
[2:14:45] Every
[2:14:47] [Music]
[2:14:57] morning
[2:14:59] is mercy.
[2:15:05] [Music]
[2:15:07] My redeemer
[2:15:10] is faithful
[2:15:13] and true.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; The scripture just come on my heart.
[2:15:22] You know the Lord said above all things
[2:15:25] he would that you would prosper in
[2:15:26] health.
[2:15:28] And you know that's not just the health
[2:15:29] of your body,
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; but again in the scripture he said that
[2:15:33] he was not giving us the spirit of fear
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; but of love and of power
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; and of a sound mind.
[2:15:43] So I certainly believe that God desires
[2:15:47] us uh that we would have that kind of a
[2:15:50] health mentally
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; in an age when it when everything around
[2:15:55] us is trying to take that health from
[2:15:57] us.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; And you know u brother Jerry we're we're
[2:16:02] so sorry you had to suffer those things
[2:16:05] but we as an assembly we certainly have
[2:16:09] prospered from what you have went
[2:16:10] through. to hear your testimony tonight.
[2:16:13] We thank you for sharing with us.
[2:16:17] [Applause]
[2:16:24] [Music]
[2:16:28] A man gets deep in his life like that
[2:16:30] and pulls out a piece and shares and
[2:16:33] vulnerability and weakness. It it it
[2:16:35] takes it takes a lot of courage to stand
[2:16:39] before a congregation and put yourself
[2:16:41] out like that, but knowing that by him
[2:16:44] doing that that God's going to help
[2:16:46] somebody and he's going to use that. And
[2:16:49] you know, uh, I appreciate you helping
[2:16:52] deal with the stigma that's around
[2:16:55] mental mental health and and what is
[2:16:58] there, but nobody thinks nothing if
[2:17:00] somebody breaks an arm, but if they're
[2:17:01] having uh if they're having struggles
[2:17:03] mentally, it's like something's wrong
[2:17:05] with them. Well, Amen. It's not always
[2:17:08] something wrong. It may just be
[2:17:10] something that's just out of balance or
[2:17:12] something that's happened. Amen. But the
[2:17:14] Holy Spirit has a way of of healing the
[2:17:17] mind, the body, the soul, and then send
[2:17:19] the man of God by and tell you
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; even after 12 long years.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; 12 long years,
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; and he's more more powerful preacher
[2:17:30] tonight than I heard 20 years ago.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; His he there's a there's a faith
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; that is resting there. And I and I thank
[2:17:38] you for that nugget.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; You don't have to testify to your
[2:17:41] healing. You can testify to your faith.

[2:17:45] down in my book. And Amen. I'm going to
[2:17:47] give the devil a whipon with that. Amen.

[2:18:08] how God had so worked in his life. and
