[34:05] brother eric please come and sing this
[34:07] morning
[34:22] do you got heaven on your mind oh i tell
[34:24] you
[34:25] you know i just can't quite get it off
[34:27] mine
[34:28] and uh you know sometimes i get up
[34:30] saying everybody gets a little nervous
[34:31] and anxiety and whatever but
[34:33] i just kind of want to thank brother
[34:34] ashton for kind of stepping he just got
[34:37] anxious right there i want to mention
[34:38] his name but for
[34:40] forgiving his testimony about having
[34:42] anxiety and uh you know
[34:45] a lot of times things will get on your
[34:47] nerves and the devil he just kind of
[34:48] gets on your nerves and sometimes you
[34:50] got to shake him off a little bit and
[34:52] the holy ghost has a way of doing that
[34:54] um
[34:56] the other well maybe a
[34:58] couple weeks ago i was just sitting
[35:00] there at home praying and i thought god
[35:04] you've saved me
[35:05] you've took me away from the things of
[35:07] the world
[35:08] you've brought me into the truth for my
[35:10] day
[35:11] there's many truths out there but none
[35:14] that's going to rapture us out of here
[35:16] except like this one
[35:18] and i said lord oh you give me good
[35:20] parents that raised me right never heard
[35:22] a cuss word in my house
[35:24] even me and my brother might say
[35:27] oh just a bye word and he'd say boys now
[35:30] that's just the same as saying the other
[35:32] you know so quit saying that
[35:35] and um
[35:36] but i just thanked him for all that he
[35:38] had done for me and then i got to
[35:39] thinking
[35:41] lord is there anything i could do for
[35:42] you anything i could do for you that you
[35:45] don't already got have you ever tried to
[35:47] buy somebody a christmas present that
[35:49] has everything
[35:50] you know
[35:51] don't buy from my parents you know you
[35:53] gotta really think about that lord's
[35:55] blessed them but um but i was thinking
[35:57] lord is there
[35:58] anything i could do for you
[36:00] and
[36:02] there's nothing i could think of and all
[36:04] at once i remember hearing brother
[36:06] uh margolis well margolis he always
[36:08] corrects me said there's no r in my
[36:10] goalless right sister and and so anyway
[36:13] i heard him saying up here one time
[36:16] he said you know i love my children
[36:18] he said and
[36:20] there were some people come over and
[36:21] blessed my children
[36:23] and they gave him a gift and he said you
[36:25] know it was more important to me made me
[36:28] feel better
[36:29] that they gave my children a gift than
[36:31] if they would give me the gift
[36:32] personally
[36:33] and so i thought well maybe lord that's
[36:35] what i could do for you
[36:37] maybe i could bless your children with a
[36:40] song and if i could bless your children
[36:42] with a song maybe i'd be blessing you
[36:45] and you know brother anxiety
[36:47] it's just here it just has it's it's got
[36:50] its place you know
[36:52] but sometimes singing is healing
[36:54] um
[36:55] this song about saying i don't really
[36:57] know the
[36:58] the title of it i just call it the bride
[37:00] song and i was sitting here eating lunch
[37:02] with brother terry tidwell one day there
[37:04] are murphy's brawl and i said who who
[37:07] even wrote this song he said i think his
[37:09] brother lineal yachts had wrote this but
[37:11] it's called the bride song and um
[37:14] i just think of uh
[37:16] back when people came out of the
[37:18] denominations and came into this truth
[37:21] how that they were so excited about this
[37:23] message they just wrote about it and
[37:24] there's so many songs but i'm just going
[37:26] to try this for you i pray that it'll
[37:28] bless you i think i've talked enough to
[37:30] get my anxiety down just a little bit
[37:34] so
[37:36] lord
[37:38] let me sing
[37:41] the brightest song
[37:44] [Music]
[37:46] oh to this world the bride has never
[37:52] looked so defeated
[37:56] while waiting for
[37:59] a promised rapture

[1:04:40] chapter 1

[1:04:52] the reason is i'm i'm just going to
[1:04:56] be nice and kind

[1:05:07] button on i got my button on
[1:05:10] i'm just gonna be a little
[1:05:12] more
[1:05:13] what do you say not reserved just a
[1:05:15] little bit more you know less animated
[1:05:18] okay
[1:05:20] first peter chapter 1
[1:05:23] verse 23 please
[1:05:26] we can start at 22
[1:05:29] seeing you have purified your souls and
[1:05:32] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:05:35] unto unfeigned love of the brethren
[1:05:38] see that you love one another
[1:05:40] with a pure heart
[1:05:42] fervently
[1:05:43] being born again not of the corruptable
[1:05:46] seed but of the incorruptable
[1:05:48] by the word of god which liveth and
[1:05:50] abideth
[1:05:52] forever
[1:05:53] for all flesh
[1:05:55] is as grass and all the glory of man is
[1:05:58] the flower of grass the grass withereth
[1:06:01] and the flower thereof
[1:06:03] falleth away
[1:06:05] but the word
[1:06:07] i want you to take a look at this verse
[1:06:09] please
[1:06:10] but the word of the lord endureth
[1:06:15] forever
[1:06:16] i'd like you to take a special note
[1:06:18] let's i'll reread that for you please
[1:06:21] but the word of the lord
[1:06:24] endureth forever
[1:06:26] and this is the word
[1:06:29] which by the gospel is preached
[1:06:33] unto you
[1:06:34] god bless you all have your seats please
[1:06:47] vermin
[1:06:49] domini
[1:06:52] you see brother tom where are you going
[1:06:54] already
[1:06:58] can i i'll start it again i'm speaking
[1:07:00] latin
[1:07:04] and probably not very good latin at all
[1:07:07] but i googled it to see how to say it
[1:07:13] verbum
[1:07:15] domini menet
[1:07:17] eterna
[1:07:21] verbum domini minet in term
[1:07:25] the word of the lord endureth
[1:07:29] forever
[1:07:30] that's what it means
[1:07:32] in latin
[1:07:33] now how many know where that slogan came
[1:07:37] from or that
[1:07:38] verbiage came from not only from the
[1:07:40] scripture
[1:07:42] but when the
[1:07:44] reformation started
[1:07:47] and the words started to unfold
[1:07:51] in its justification
[1:07:54] this is what they put on their swords
[1:07:57] on their sleeves
[1:07:59] on their breasts
[1:08:00] on everything
[1:08:03] the word of the lord endureth forever
[1:08:06] and no
[1:08:08] pope no pope
[1:08:11] no bishop
[1:08:12] no cardinal no nothing is going to start
[1:08:16] stop the word from being preached
[1:08:20] for the word of the lord endureth
[1:08:23] forever it doesn't matter how many
[1:08:25] spirits come against this message the
[1:08:28] word of the lord endureth
[1:08:31] come on say it to me the word of the
[1:08:33] lord endureth for
[1:08:35] forever and ever and ever because the
[1:08:38] word's eternal as we spoke on last night
[1:08:42] so if you want to learn a little bit of
[1:08:44] latin you just write it down verbum
[1:08:46] domini minette etierum
[1:08:49] boy i went to church and learned
[1:08:50] something today
[1:08:53] and that was all free
[1:08:58] say son
[1:08:59] did you learn what brother tom said this
[1:09:00] morning yes mom vermin
[1:09:04] domini mineta turned
[1:09:07] the word of the lord endureth forever
[1:09:09] mom
[1:09:12] it does indeed
[1:09:14] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:09:16] seventh angel
[1:09:18] when he shall begin to sound
[1:09:21] that sounding
[1:09:23] could only be the word of the lord
[1:09:25] endure forever
[1:09:28] god had to have a messenger for that
[1:09:30] word to come forth because satan in all
[1:09:34] his
[1:09:35] weaponry
[1:09:37] has deadened the word
[1:09:40] has made it
[1:09:42] meaningless
[1:09:44] but there is a life that comes with the
[1:09:47] word and you have to walk in the light
[1:09:51] as he is in the light then the blood of
[1:09:54] jesus christ cleanses you from all sin
[1:09:57] so then you can say as the word of god
[1:10:00] walks in the light as he is in the light
[1:10:02] as you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:10:04] light then the word of god endures
[1:10:07] forever
[1:10:09] so
[1:10:10] if it did something for one
[1:10:13] it will do it for another
[1:10:17] very simple right
[1:10:19] god changes not and
[1:10:22] um how many have ever heard hebrews 13 8
[1:10:25] in your life
[1:10:28] somebody around yeah we have
[1:10:32] hebrews 13 8 and we'll rattle it off
[1:10:35] jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:10:38] today
[1:10:39] and forever
[1:10:41] the word of god endureth forever
[1:10:44] how many times did the prophet say
[1:10:46] yesterday today and forever
[1:10:49] how many times have you heard it
[1:10:52] i'm just setting you up you know
[1:10:54] i've got my button up
[1:11:00] see and then some people are saying keep
[1:11:01] the button on
[1:11:06] how many times was a reference that
[1:11:08] jesus christ was saying yesterday to
[1:11:10] them forever
[1:11:11] how many times have your pastor
[1:11:13] mentioned ministry of mention
[1:11:16] how many times have you read it in the
[1:11:17] message book and how many times have you
[1:11:18] read it in your bible
[1:11:21] and yet we still don't seem to fully
[1:11:24] come to grips
[1:11:26] with the impact and power of it
[1:11:30] if he was a deliverer with moses he's a
[1:11:33] deliverer today
[1:11:36] amen if he kept the death angel at bay
[1:11:41] in exodus he'll keep the death angel at
[1:11:44] bay today
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:48] why because the word of god endureth
[1:11:50] forever
[1:11:51] so whatever you read in genesis you can
[1:11:53] read in revelation whatever you see in
[1:11:55] deuteronomy you will see in revelation
[1:11:57] whatever you see in all the books of the
[1:11:59] bible because the word of god endureth
[1:12:01] forever he showed himself as victory he
[1:12:04] showed himself as niecy he showed
[1:12:06] himself as the mighty god
[1:12:09] has he changed
[1:12:11] why the word of god endures forever
[1:12:14] is that true
[1:12:15] and he's the same what yesterday today
[1:12:17] and forever is that true
[1:12:20] is he a savior did he save you
[1:12:23] did he save you
[1:12:25] did he deliver you did he give you the
[1:12:28] holy ghost that he still saves he still
[1:12:31] delivers and he still gives the holy
[1:12:33] ghost
[1:12:36] [Applause]
[1:12:39] so we see in the scripture we we see how
[1:12:41] god moved and we read it through the
[1:12:43] gospels and we marvel about the apostles
[1:12:45] you know the apostles were just like you
[1:12:46] and me
[1:12:48] they were just like you and me
[1:12:52] we we we start raising them up and and
[1:12:55] god
[1:12:56] god we give them honor due to hey the
[1:12:59] lord jesus picked them out
[1:13:01] and won a devil
[1:13:04] but he also picked you out
[1:13:07] so he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:09] forever and when we still have sons of
[1:13:12] thunder
[1:13:14] huh we still have sons of thunder
[1:13:17] and still got mothers saying can they
[1:13:19] sit on the right hand
[1:13:21] my son's better preacher than your son
[1:13:25] i still got the button huh
[1:13:29] huh
[1:13:30] is that true can you imagine the other
[1:13:32] apostles saying who do they think they
[1:13:34] are
[1:13:35] they even got their mom involved
[1:13:39] come on
[1:13:41] you know we see you know we see the
[1:13:42] super part of it but let's just see the
[1:13:44] natural part of it and then we can start
[1:13:47] to see ourselves in it
[1:13:50] and that's why brother braham said there
[1:13:51] was peter the boisterous one you know
[1:13:53] and then you got andrew the prayer
[1:13:55] warrior you got everybody has their own
[1:13:57] personality and everyone was needed in
[1:14:00] the body and so i'm looking at a church
[1:14:03] today that is needed for this body
[1:14:08] and don't send your mother up to me and
[1:14:10] tell me how great your sons are
[1:14:14] you're great because god chose you
[1:14:20] you mean i'm great yeah you're very
[1:14:22] great
[1:14:23] so we're going to look at the subject
[1:14:25] this morning we'll just take our little
[1:14:26] bit of time and if time goes on and your
[1:14:29] roast burns blame me i'll be flying out
[1:14:32] tomorrow
[1:14:35] but as at home over this
[1:14:38] type of season we do have
[1:14:40] one service on our sunday so we take our
[1:14:43] liberty
[1:14:45] and the pastor said i could
[1:14:49] so
[1:14:50] i'll take my time
[1:14:53] by god's grace
[1:14:55] so now here we here we find ourselves
[1:14:57] reading this scripture i jesus now i
[1:15:00] jesus who which we found out in the in
[1:15:04] revelation chapter 1 that he which was
[1:15:06] which is and shall be he was the one
[1:15:09] which was dead and is alive forevermore
[1:15:11] he's the great i am and so now we find
[1:15:15] then the book of revelation
[1:15:17] is the bride's book because of who he is
[1:15:20] he's the bridegroom we've come from the
[1:15:23] bridegroom we are the bride so now he's
[1:15:26] personally writing at the very end and
[1:15:28] showing us the uh showing us that how
[1:15:31] close we are he said i jesus sent my
[1:15:34] angel to the churches
[1:15:37] and then the very next verse says and
[1:15:39] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:15:42] so there comes a time that we're going
[1:15:44] to say everything he said
[1:15:50] we have to say everything our husband
[1:15:52] says
[1:15:56] and everybody
[1:15:57] starts to think well brother branham
[1:15:59] said say what i say
[1:16:01] of course
[1:16:02] because it was god speaking through the
[1:16:04] man
[1:16:06] and the spirit and her bride say
[1:16:09] come
[1:16:10] because the word of god endureth forever
[1:16:13] and so whatever that word of god is we
[1:16:16] must believe it
[1:16:21] a lot of times and because there are
[1:16:24] some many of us some are just a little
[1:16:27] bit more charged up than others and we
[1:16:29] all get excited and we get caught up in
[1:16:31] one another's excitement
[1:16:34] but we need to get caught up
[1:16:36] in him
[1:16:38] caught up in the word
[1:16:40] you know as as paul said if you pray
[1:16:43] pray in the spirit if you walk walk in
[1:16:45] the spirit sing sing in the spirit you
[1:16:47] get you know and it's so easy to type
[1:16:50] that so naturally because if i if if it
[1:16:53] was the world series and tickets were
[1:16:55] smiling at 500 a piece and all of a
[1:16:58] sudden your boss gave you you know
[1:17:00] box seats
[1:17:02] you know you wouldn't be sitting around
[1:17:03] saying oh i just got a boxing plan
[1:17:06] i know
[1:17:07] hey guess what
[1:17:09] you're going to tell your friends your
[1:17:11] family everybody else that you've got a
[1:17:15] special seat
[1:17:18] to the world series
[1:17:19] but i want to tell you there is a throne
[1:17:24] and that's a very special seat
[1:17:26] and to them that overcome
[1:17:28] will i grant you sit with me in my
[1:17:30] father's throne
[1:17:32] and i'm looking at the owner of commerce
[1:17:35] and you have a special seat
[1:17:38] so you do have something to rejoice
[1:17:40] about this morning
[1:17:42] i've already been prophesied to overcome
[1:17:47] you're not a failure you're a winner
[1:17:50] you're an overcomer
[1:17:53] satan
[1:17:54] i put you under my feet
[1:17:57] get behind me
[1:18:00] it's already been prophesied
[1:18:03] it's already been spoken
[1:18:07] soon the lamb will take his bride
[1:18:10] to be ever at his side
[1:18:14] hi
[1:18:16] that's
[1:18:18] what's happening
[1:18:21] people
[1:18:22] are looking for an event
[1:18:24] when the event is taking place
[1:18:29] oh i'm looking for something some saints
[1:18:31] i just want to tell you this morning
[1:18:33] we're already in it
[1:18:36] for the lord himself shall descend
[1:18:39] with a shout
[1:18:40] with a voice
[1:18:42] with a trump of an archangel brother
[1:18:44] bram said he does all three as he
[1:18:46] descends
[1:18:48] so don't look for a rapture just start
[1:18:50] realizing you're in the rapture
[1:18:53] and that's why the devil fights you so
[1:18:55] much
[1:18:56] and that's why we need to preach the
[1:18:58] word because the word endureth forever
[1:19:09] oh no
[1:19:11] i haven't done this in a long time
[1:19:17] no you're gonna see my tummy
[1:19:22] isn't it marvelous
[1:19:23] we can come to church rejoice in what we
[1:19:25] believe
[1:19:27] knowing we are the elect
[1:19:29] see gene
[1:19:31] of the living god
[1:19:33] i've come from god i go back to god so
[1:19:36] now we're in we're in a cycle saints it
[1:19:38] cannot be stopped
[1:19:41] and we don't want it to stop
[1:19:43] so now we're in the days of the voice of
[1:19:45] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:19:46] sound all the mistress of god shall be
[1:19:48] finished because the word of god endures
[1:19:49] forever
[1:19:51] we understand then that the word of god
[1:19:54] unfolds
[1:19:56] let's turn to matthew 13.
[1:20:04] matthew chapter 13
[1:20:07] verse 37
[1:20:13] matthew 13
[1:20:16] 37.
[1:20:20] now you start to understand well as we
[1:20:23] get into it
[1:20:24] an invisible union when a prophet can
[1:20:27] speak out and say prophetically because
[1:20:29] he's seeing it in that world
[1:20:31] he's letting you know
[1:20:33] i hear
[1:20:34] the combines coming
[1:20:37] so he's preaching that in 1965 and here
[1:20:40] we are in 2021.
[1:20:42] so now we start to understand then as
[1:20:44] that word has come throughout the ages
[1:20:47] down to this time that there is a people
[1:20:49] that are coming to its ripening
[1:20:53] because the combines can't come
[1:20:56] until the seed is right
[1:21:00] and let me tell you wherever god is is a
[1:21:03] bumper crop
[1:21:07] he doesn't ever have a crop failure
[1:21:10] never a crop failure
[1:21:12] every crop jesus has is a bumper crop
[1:21:19] amen so in verse 37 it says he answered
[1:21:23] and said unto them
[1:21:25] he that soweth
[1:21:27] the good seed
[1:21:29] who's good
[1:21:32] you might as well just say it
[1:21:35] and jesus said there is no one good but
[1:21:37] god
[1:21:38] hello
[1:21:45] didn't we get did you get it last night
[1:21:47] i got it i've come from god i'm going
[1:21:50] back to god you're as eternal as god is
[1:21:53] so that good seed had to come from the
[1:21:56] good husbandmen
[1:21:58] we're a part of him
[1:22:01] we're not rich young rulers
[1:22:03] don't get then get your mind confused
[1:22:05] nobody's good hey
[1:22:07] people say i'm just not worthy really
[1:22:10] did you read the message
[1:22:11] it's called the church age book
[1:22:13] in the church age book he says you're
[1:22:16] worthy because the worthy one
[1:22:19] says you're worthy
[1:22:21] [Music]
[1:22:23] can you go with me on this
[1:22:24] you know what worthy means axiom that's
[1:22:27] what worthy means so in axiom means
[1:22:30] scale
[1:22:31] so when jesus stepped on the scale
[1:22:34] he doesn't have an imbalance scale he
[1:22:36] has a balanced scale so the worthy one
[1:22:39] stepped on the axiom or the scale so the
[1:22:42] bride steps on the other side and she's
[1:22:45] even
[1:22:46] equal
[1:22:48] come on equal
[1:22:50] let this mind i was in christ be in you
[1:22:53] who thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:22:56] with god
[1:22:59] you might as well say praise the lord
[1:23:01] i'm finding who i am it's my position in
[1:23:05] christ and when she realizes who she is
[1:23:09] worthy good
[1:23:11] not of your goodness and none of your
[1:23:13] worthiness it's all him
[1:23:16] he says you're good he says you're
[1:23:18] worthy
[1:23:19] oh i'm just not worthy i'm so humble no
[1:23:21] you're not you're an unbeliever
[1:23:26] brother
[1:23:30] that is a denominational thought
[1:23:34] but at the sounding of the seven angels
[1:23:36] message
[1:23:37] that word endures forever
[1:23:40] what goes in the ground is coming out of
[1:23:42] the ground
[1:23:43] that corn of wheat went in the ground
[1:23:46] you are the harvest of what went in the
[1:23:48] ground
[1:23:51] glory
[1:23:55] amen so what he is she is
[1:24:03] well we're going to beat that devil down
[1:24:05] today
[1:24:06] get him beat him right down brother
[1:24:07] erickson
[1:24:08] because he's not even worried to talk
[1:24:10] about
[1:24:11] we might as well just boot him out of
[1:24:12] the room
[1:24:13] as we said last night he's howling about
[1:24:15] this because she's getting it
[1:24:18] she is actually getting it now
[1:24:22] so now he that soweth the good seed is
[1:24:24] the son of man remember we read the
[1:24:27] quota of the christ mystery god revealed
[1:24:28] last night he couldn't reveal himself as
[1:24:31] as a god that lived for billions and
[1:24:33] trillions and eons and trillions of
[1:24:34] times but he could reveal himself as the
[1:24:37] son of man
[1:24:41] so now this he that soweth the good seed
[1:24:44] is the son of man
[1:24:45] the field is the world
[1:24:47] the good seed are the children of the
[1:24:49] kingdom
[1:24:50] there you go
[1:24:52] there you go
[1:24:54] the good seed
[1:24:56] so god is telling you you're good
[1:24:58] the devil's telling you your bath
[1:25:01] so who are you going to believe
[1:25:03] i think i'll choose jesus
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:07] i am the good seed
[1:25:09] and so now the good seed are the
[1:25:11] children of the kingdom of god but the
[1:25:13] tares are the children of the wicked one
[1:25:16] the enemy so of them is the devil
[1:25:20] harvest is the end
[1:25:22] of the world
[1:25:24] and the reapers are the angels and i
[1:25:27] jesus
[1:25:29] sent angels to the church ages
[1:25:32] it was god that sent this message for
[1:25:35] you
[1:25:36] to realize who you are
[1:25:39] in the word and his word
[1:25:43] come on you thought it was the bible
[1:25:46] but now i'm saying to you the word
[1:25:49] endureth
[1:25:50] come on
[1:25:52] the word the word
[1:25:54] the word the word endureth forever
[1:25:59] and ever
[1:26:00] and ever
[1:26:03] amen we are the word made flesh today
[1:26:06] this is what the scripture said
[1:26:08] we don't just sing about it saying we
[1:26:10] confess it we speak it we live it we
[1:26:14] love it
[1:26:17] amen we don't play church no more
[1:26:20] they're not playing church oh praise the
[1:26:21] lord hallelujah bring 15 songs
[1:26:24] huh get the preacher preaching that's
[1:26:27] playing church don't play church if the
[1:26:30] word strikes your heart say amen
[1:26:33] if the word becomes real then you lift
[1:26:35] up your hands
[1:26:37] glorify god
[1:26:42] we have a place we can let off the
[1:26:43] pressure
[1:26:44] and that is right here right now as soon
[1:26:47] as you go out those doors i got a
[1:26:49] mortgage payment i got a car payment i
[1:26:50] got groceries to buy i got this to go
[1:26:53] and right now you're forgetting
[1:26:54] everything why because you're sitting in
[1:26:56] heavenly places
[1:26:58] brother abraham says we're sitting in
[1:26:59] heavenly places always
[1:27:04] amen so we take this with us
[1:27:06] we don't just leave it at church we're
[1:27:08] not playing church we are the church
[1:27:14] so now we know the
[1:27:17] tares are the children of the wicked one
[1:27:19] the enemy that saw them as the devil the
[1:27:22] harvest is the end of the world
[1:27:25] did not your prophet preach harvest time
[1:27:28] didn't he not preach harvest time
[1:27:31] did he not say the combines are coming
[1:27:34] so now what are we waiting for that last
[1:27:36] one
[1:27:37] so what our duty is then to go get the
[1:27:39] last one
[1:27:41] right
[1:27:42] that's all we do and we don't even have
[1:27:44] to do anything because the footsteps of
[1:27:46] the righteous are ordered of god
[1:27:49] we've been having a revival in our
[1:27:50] little church
[1:27:52] and we're not even doing anything
[1:27:55] because it isn't the works of man it's
[1:27:57] the works of
[1:27:58] god you say brother tom how did it

[1:32:25] much money watching a football game
[1:32:28] i don't know who won or whatever
[1:32:32] [Laughter]
[1:32:36] you made my point very clear
[1:32:41] because he said we won
[1:32:45] i said how did you win
[1:32:47] how did you when you're on an airplane
[1:32:50] you are logged in you've never been on
[1:32:52] the field you've never touched the
[1:32:54] football but he said we won
[1:32:57] why he was identified with the team
[1:33:00] come on you're identified with this
[1:33:03] resurrection
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:09] you
[1:33:10] have won
[1:33:15] glory
[1:33:19] that's why brother brahms said i've
[1:33:20] identified when they were on guam i
[1:33:22] identified with washington at the
[1:33:24] delaware identified he said i was there
[1:33:27] but i was there in jesus christ i was
[1:33:30] there with paul meeting the pillar of
[1:33:32] fire
[1:33:33] come on i was there with william brown
[1:33:36] when that pillar of fire hung over that
[1:33:38] prophet
[1:33:40] we
[1:33:41] won
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:46] hallelujah
[1:33:50] come on it's harvest time we can rejoice
[1:33:54] the life is in the seed
[1:33:56] and if you're the good seed you have a
[1:33:58] right to rejoice you have a right to
[1:33:59] shout and sing you have a right to
[1:34:01] glorify god
[1:34:04] hallelujah
[1:34:05] we're in an exodus hour at harvest time
[1:34:08] when did the children of israel pass
[1:34:10] jordan was at harvest time
[1:34:13] everything's at harvest time when was
[1:34:16] ruth revealed
[1:34:18] at harvest time
[1:34:22] you go and take that thought throughout
[1:34:24] the scripture when when the word was
[1:34:26] coming back to israel
[1:34:29] it was at harvest time
[1:34:32] showing that when this word is being
[1:34:34] revealed
[1:34:35] it's going to be at harvest time
[1:34:41] at harvest time
[1:34:43] that's when the enemy fights
[1:34:46] are you with me
[1:34:48] as soon as i say enemy everyone
[1:34:52] yeah come on david
[1:34:54] he didn't run away from the fight
[1:34:57] no no no no no he ran to the fight he
[1:35:00] was of a different seed
[1:35:03] and so when he heard the boasts of those
[1:35:05] philistines that philistine
[1:35:08] he said you gonna allow them to defy the
[1:35:11] armies of the living god
[1:35:13] and who are you and his brother said
[1:35:15] you're a naughty boy
[1:35:17] and every one of us say that naughty is
[1:35:20] sort of a nice
[1:35:21] word saying you're bad no look it up in
[1:35:23] the hebrew you'll find out it's a nasty
[1:35:25] word
[1:35:26] they weren't calling him just some
[1:35:29] they were calling him some
[1:35:32] words that weren't allowed to be spoken
[1:35:34] in a house
[1:35:38] huh
[1:35:39] and so but he knew who he was he knew he
[1:35:42] was anointed under a prophet's message
[1:35:46] he knew he had to go to the throne
[1:35:48] i don't care if there's a thousand
[1:35:50] goliaths
[1:35:51] that old stone would have gone bong bong
[1:35:54] bong bong
[1:35:56] because it wasn't the stone
[1:35:58] it was god that was behind the stone
[1:36:01] it's not your revelation it's going
[1:36:03] behind your revelation
[1:36:06] and that's what slaying 200 000 000
[1:36:08] supernatural demons
[1:36:12] brother braham said when a victorious
[1:36:13] son of god walks down those sidewalks
[1:36:16] those devils faint in house
[1:36:19] it's brother ray erickson
[1:36:24] we don't see in that realm but a
[1:36:25] prophet's on that realm he was trying to
[1:36:27] tell you about that realm
[1:36:31] say man i had a hard day at work no
[1:36:32] wonder you're fighting devils all day
[1:36:34] and your angel was going around
[1:36:41] are you getting it
[1:36:43] i got it
[1:36:50] hallelujah and therefore the tares are
[1:36:54] gathered and burned in fire
[1:36:56] so shall it be at the end of this world
[1:36:59] the son of man shall send forth his
[1:37:01] angels
[1:37:02] and they shall gather out of his kingdom
[1:37:05] all things that offend and them that do
[1:37:08] iniquity and shall cast them into a
[1:37:10] furnace of fire and there shall be
[1:37:12] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[1:37:15] and then shall the righteous
[1:37:20] oh righteous
[1:37:23] you're good
[1:37:24] you're worthy
[1:37:29] then shall the righteous shine forth as
[1:37:30] the son and the kingdom of their father
[1:37:33] who have years to hear
[1:37:35] let him hear
[1:37:38] so you wonder why
[1:37:41] you're in a battle
[1:37:43] can i help you
[1:37:46] i've already told you you're going to
[1:37:47] win anyway
[1:37:50] so
[1:37:51] do you win
[1:37:54] so let's turn to judges
[1:37:56] chapter 6.
[1:38:05] judges chapter 6.
[1:38:18] just before we read it he says and so
[1:38:20] brother brahm says in a resume
[1:38:23] of the church eight book and so we've
[1:38:24] come to the last days the latest in age
[1:38:26] that's our age
[1:38:28] we know it's the last age for the jews
[1:38:30] are back in palestine
[1:38:31] no matter how they got there they are
[1:38:34] there
[1:38:36] and this is harvest time
[1:38:39] but before there can be a harvest there
[1:38:41] has to be a ripening
[1:38:43] and that is why we were told to lay in
[1:38:45] the presence of the sun as we said last
[1:38:47] night that's the only way you can add to
[1:38:49] your stature because everything you need
[1:38:52] in this journey the prophet said is
[1:38:54] already in you
[1:38:56] you can do nothing but lay in the
[1:38:59] presence of the son
[1:39:00] that's our duty
[1:39:02] and so now we're at harvest time and the
[1:39:05] bible says here in judges six and one
[1:39:07] and the children of israel did evil in
[1:39:09] the sight of the lord and the lord
[1:39:10] delivered them into the hands of the
[1:39:13] midian seven years or they've been bound
[1:39:16] for seven years can we say they've gone
[1:39:19] through their ages
[1:39:21] they've come through their ages
[1:39:23] and the hand of the millions prevailed
[1:39:25] against israel because of the medianite
[1:39:28] the children of israel made them dense
[1:39:31] now they were living under privilege
[1:39:34] this is the children of the living god
[1:39:39] but they did evil in the sight of the
[1:39:40] lord
[1:39:42] and now because of their wickedness
[1:39:45] they're living under privilege living in
[1:39:48] caves
[1:39:50] and then the enemy prevailed against
[1:39:51] them the midianites
[1:39:53] the children of israel made them dens
[1:39:56] which are in the mountains and the caves
[1:39:58] and the strongholds and so it was with
[1:40:01] when israel had sown
[1:40:06] so now we see the sowing has taken place
[1:40:11] and let's just say last night we did
[1:40:13] some sawing
[1:40:17] the word
[1:40:20] so the word got song
[1:40:25] and so now
[1:40:29] and when israel had sown
[1:40:31] the medianites came up one power
[1:40:36] the amalekites came up two powers
[1:40:41] and the children of the east came up
[1:40:42] three powers
[1:40:45] religious political
[1:40:47] and demonic
[1:40:48] that's what we battle that's what your
[1:40:50] prophet said
[1:40:52] we battled three powers
[1:40:56] and they encamped against them
[1:40:59] and destroyed the increase of the earth
[1:41:04] why
[1:41:05] do you think the enemy wants to destroy
[1:41:08] the increase
[1:41:10] when you come to a meeting
[1:41:13] a special meeting
[1:41:15] on wednesday night
[1:41:17] did you say a special meeting on
[1:41:18] wednesday night
[1:41:20] every meeting special
[1:41:25] every meeting is special
[1:41:28] because jesus comes wherever two or
[1:41:30] three are gathered
[1:41:32] is that true then if where jesus is it's
[1:41:35] special
[1:41:38] so whenever the word is sown there is a
[1:41:41] devil that wants to take away your
[1:41:43] increase
[1:41:44] why do you think you have such bad days
[1:41:46] on monday
[1:41:48] because you heard the word that's the
[1:41:50] word i believe honey wasn't that a great
[1:41:52] word we heard tonight all of a sudden
[1:41:54] the broker mortgage broker pay hey by
[1:41:57] the way your payment is supposed to be a
[1:41:59] little bit higher there
[1:42:02] and then all of a sudden a sickness will
[1:42:03] strike the family
[1:42:05] i want you to realize tonight that every
[1:42:08] time god gives you an increase there's
[1:42:10] an enemy there that wants to take it
[1:42:12] away
[1:42:15] every time
[1:42:16] every meeting
[1:42:18] and that's why now we fortify ourselves
[1:42:20] in the word of god
[1:42:22] that's why the prophet said read your
[1:42:24] bible and pray what
[1:42:26] every day and how hard is that to do
[1:42:29] very hard
[1:42:30] for some it's very very very hard
[1:42:34] but it's very simple
[1:42:37] just read your bible
[1:42:39] pray every day
[1:42:41] now watch now
[1:42:43] here they come to take away they've sown
[1:42:46] and these three powers now want to take
[1:42:48] away the encamp about them to destroy
[1:42:51] the increase till they'll come into gaza
[1:42:53] and left no substance for israel
[1:42:57] the devil
[1:42:58] he is he's a he's a
[1:43:01] mean guy
[1:43:04] he's bad boys
[1:43:06] i can say worse things but i won't
[1:43:10] he's just the devil
[1:43:13] but he's out to destroy your increase
[1:43:18] you said so willingly last night i got
[1:43:21] it
[1:43:22] what did you get
[1:43:25] let's take a review class
[1:43:27] what did you get
[1:43:29] you're the virtuous sinless bride of
[1:43:31] jesus christ
[1:43:33] brother braham said christ in the midst
[1:43:34] of god revealed this bride will not fall
[1:43:39] how many believe that quote
[1:43:40] how many believe that was from the lord
[1:43:42] jesus himself
[1:43:43] absolutely but there is going to be a
[1:43:45] devil right around the corner to take
[1:43:47] that away from you and you need to say
[1:43:50] the word
[1:43:51] how did jesus defeat the devil
[1:43:53] by the word of god satan get behind me
[1:43:58] but let me for the children's sake this
[1:44:01] is a little
[1:44:02] when i started to preach whenever
[1:44:05] the devil tells you you're not a
[1:44:06] christian
[1:44:09] okay they will tell you you're not
[1:44:10] christian
[1:44:11] if you've given your heart to the lord
[1:44:14] been baptized
[1:44:15] and god's filled you with the holy ghost
[1:44:17] i know what it is to have children at a
[1:44:19] young age
[1:44:20] a son's preaching today
[1:44:22] saved at seven gave his heart to the
[1:44:25] lord in his bedroom
[1:44:27] i know what that is
[1:44:30] so when the devil says you're not
[1:44:32] that means you are
[1:44:35] because he can't tell the truth
[1:44:38] just be worried when he says you are.
[1:44:42] and i'll tell you what the devil ain't
[1:44:44] going to tell you you're a christian
[1:44:48] so if he says you're not you are
[1:44:50] say hey i like that so when they get up
[1:44:53] knowing you say you call yourself a
[1:44:54] christian amen devil
[1:44:57] i told the young people that years ago i
[1:44:59] said when you're walking down the
[1:45:00] hallway and you're seeing this that and
[1:45:01] everything else and they're calling you
[1:45:03] every name under the sun just say lift
[1:45:05] up your hands
[1:45:07] and say i'm a son
[1:45:09] of the living god
[1:45:11] and you watch those cockroaches fly
[1:45:16] because they can't stand light
[1:45:20] amen
[1:45:22] so now here's the children
[1:45:24] of israel
[1:45:26] sowing
[1:45:27] at time now they're sowing and the
[1:45:29] enemies camped about them waiting for
[1:45:31] harvest
[1:45:32] it's waiting for harvest
[1:45:34] so they're living under fear and
[1:45:36] but remember
[1:45:38] they're in there after seven days
[1:45:41] now we have to understand then here very
[1:45:44] quickly look down in verse 8 says and
[1:45:46] the lord sent
[1:45:48] what
[1:45:50] a prophet
[1:45:52] but even under the prophet's message his
[1:45:55] daddy had groves
[1:45:58] i'm gonna i'm gonna preach down to here
[1:46:02] even under the prophet's message there
[1:46:04] was a grove of baal they had an altar to
[1:46:06] baal
[1:46:07] even though a prophet was on the scene
[1:46:10] and uh years ago we used to say and you
[1:46:13] got a television set
[1:46:16] a grove
[1:46:17] but now we got ipads iphones you don't
[1:46:19] even know what i'm reading
[1:46:24] hey
[1:46:24] but god does doesn't care about me
[1:46:27] it's all about you he's trying to take
[1:46:29] your increase
[1:46:31] you come to service you say i got the
[1:46:33] word i know who i am i believe that with
[1:46:35] everything in me
[1:46:37] but all of a sudden you just say oh i
[1:46:38] think i'll watch that news feed in that
[1:46:39] newsfeed oh yeah i want to look up this
[1:46:41] subject and then another thing flashes
[1:46:42] and i'm saying where are am i
[1:46:45] how'd i get here
[1:46:48] satan is taking notes on you right
[1:46:52] now he says every time you nod your head
[1:46:55] amen agree
[1:46:57] just remember there's a snare waiting
[1:46:58] for you
[1:47:00] but i know a greater god
[1:47:04] amen so god
[1:47:06] sent them a prophet and reminded them
[1:47:10] of their deliverance out of egypt
[1:47:14] god reminded them
[1:47:16] that they were delivered out of egypt
[1:47:18] out of the world
[1:47:21] and so the prophet
[1:47:23] said unto the children of israel and
[1:47:24] said thus saith the lord god of israel
[1:47:27] i brought you up out of egypt and
[1:47:29] brought you forth out of the house of
[1:47:31] bondage i delivered you out of the hand
[1:47:34] of the egyptians and out of the hand of
[1:47:36] all that oppressed you and drave them
[1:47:38] out from before you and gave you their
[1:47:42] land
[1:47:43] and i said unto you i am the lord god
[1:47:46] fear not
[1:47:48] the gods of laodicea
[1:47:51] the gods of sports
[1:47:54] the gods of entertainment
[1:47:56] come on you stay with me these are
[1:47:58] demons
[1:47:59] that are out to destroy your increase
[1:48:04] do not fear them
[1:48:06] it is i
[1:48:08] be not afraid
[1:48:13] remember jesus is always in the boat
[1:48:17] come on it doesn't matter what kind of
[1:48:19] storm you're in
[1:48:21] stay with me
[1:48:22] doesn't matter what kind of storm you're
[1:48:24] in that storm brought jesus on the scene
[1:48:30] oh i'm going to sloan brother tom praise
[1:48:32] the lord
[1:48:37] praise the lord
[1:48:38] a storm brought down a plane
[1:48:42] for a prophet to pray
[1:48:44] for a man dying a syphilis you say the
[1:48:47] storm was bad who said it was bad
[1:48:50] that was good
[1:48:54] come on
[1:48:56] that storm brought a prophet on the
[1:48:58] scene
[1:48:59] they were living in times of storms and
[1:49:02] here's a prophet on the scene telling
[1:49:04] them now fear not the gods of the
[1:49:07] amorites whose land you dwell in
[1:49:09] and then there came an angel of the lord
[1:49:12] and brother brown said after the
[1:49:13] prophet's message the angel descended
[1:49:19] i love it
[1:49:21] so now we hear the word of the lord
[1:49:24] brother erickson we hear the word of the
[1:49:25] lord through a prophet
[1:49:28] and that prophet was making way
[1:49:30] for the lord himself
[1:49:34] and the lord himself was the one that
[1:49:36] was telling gideon you're a mighty man
[1:49:38] of valor
[1:49:41] he didn't even know that
[1:49:42] under a prophet's message but when the
[1:49:45] book was open and you found your name in
[1:49:47] the book you started to realize who you
[1:49:49] are in christ
[1:49:52] you
[1:49:52] are his victory
[1:50:00] hallelujah
[1:50:01] why because now the lord himself
[1:50:05] has come down to tell you who you are
[1:50:13] who you are
[1:50:17] and the angel appeared unto him and said
[1:50:20] the lord is with thee
[1:50:22] the mind thou mighty man of valor
[1:50:30] who believes that
[1:50:34] i i mean really
[1:50:36] i mean gideon wasn't much to look at
[1:50:39] like me or you
[1:50:41] you really ain't really
[1:50:46] we're not much to look at
[1:50:49] and yet god comes by our way he says
[1:50:52] you're the bride
[1:50:53] you're the virtuous bride you're the
[1:50:55] sinless ride
[1:50:59] you're the virtuous
[1:51:02] you're the mighty
[1:51:03] me
[1:51:05] a man of valor me
[1:51:07] i haven't done anything
[1:51:09] and neither i get in
[1:51:11] but brother brown said he did one thing
[1:51:13] he believed
[1:51:16] and that's where it separates the men
[1:51:18] from the boys
[1:51:21] he believed what the angel said he was
[1:51:25] lord if if that's really you can i give
[1:51:28] you an offering can i lay myself on the
[1:51:31] rock of revelation
[1:51:33] could you lap me up
[1:51:36] could you extend your rod
[1:51:38] could you take me as i am lord
[1:51:41] but i'm not nothing i'm i'm the least of
[1:51:43] the kingdom i'm come from a family and
[1:51:46] everybody has the same problem moses had
[1:51:48] the problem
[1:51:49] gideon had the problem we have the
[1:51:51] problem
[1:51:52] yeah but we're nobody's exactly right we
[1:51:55] are nobodies but we're somebodies we're
[1:51:57] his somebodies
[1:52:00] so now gideon is catching this
[1:52:02] revelation
[1:52:03] and so now here hear their camp's about
[1:52:05] there's 132 thousand
[1:52:08] now i know
[1:52:10] by the sounds of it people know football
[1:52:13] around here
[1:52:17] so louisiana state university anybody
[1:52:19] ever heard of them
[1:52:22] i won't hear now
[1:52:24] no never
[1:52:25] because you're not from louisiana
[1:52:28] but
[1:52:29] i'm saying that to make a point brother
[1:52:31] ray
[1:52:31] it's the largest stadium
[1:52:34] and now they're bringing me down to
[1:52:36] getting bigger but it was it held over i
[1:52:38] think 84 000 people
[1:52:41] okay
[1:52:42] because i want to give you a little
[1:52:43] visual
[1:52:45] because now here here comes israel
[1:52:48] and here they are
[1:52:49] 32 000 strong against a hundred and
[1:52:54] 120 000 strong
[1:52:57] and he says to them now if anybody's
[1:52:59] afraid just leave will you leave
[1:53:02] can you imagine they admitted they were
[1:53:04] afraid and i've said to the church well
[1:53:06] if you're afraid of this just leave
[1:53:08] they said brother tom told us to leave
[1:53:11] we're supposed to say come to church
[1:53:12] come to church if you're afraid go
[1:53:17] oh
[1:53:18] brother rail never had me back now i
[1:53:20] know that
[1:53:22] he's telling my people to go home
[1:53:24] go home if you're afraid
[1:53:26] thanks we're not afraid
[1:53:28] and then he had to keep on dividing them
[1:53:32] then he had to say okay okay now there's
[1:53:34] still too many here there's just still
[1:53:35] too many let's have another test let's
[1:53:38] see how you drink
[1:53:40] ah
[1:53:41] there's a fountain open
[1:53:44] amen there's a word opened up
[1:53:47] let's see how you drink
[1:53:49] and there was 300 that knew how to drink
[1:53:52] from the fountain
[1:53:56] and it was those 300 that gideon used
[1:53:59] so now put 300 in the middle of
[1:54:03] lsu
[1:54:05] stadium
[1:54:06] when there's 84 000 but you got to add
[1:54:09] another 50 on top of that
[1:54:11] and it was going to be those 300 that's
[1:54:14] going to defeat every one of those and
[1:54:16] my bible says not one of them died
[1:54:19] come on
[1:54:20] not one of the 300 died
[1:54:24] and
[1:54:25] and gideon put the devil on the run
[1:54:29] is that true
[1:54:31] and the bible says he was faint yet
[1:54:34] pursued amen you might get weary but
[1:54:37] keep pursuing
[1:54:39] keep pursuing
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] amen keep pursuing that devil he knew he
[1:54:46] had a right to drive that devil out of
[1:54:49] every part of his land
[1:54:52] it's harvest time that's when the enemy
[1:54:55] tries to take your harvest
[1:54:59] that's true
[1:55:01] brother brahma said the lutheran age was
[1:55:03] the springtime
[1:55:04] the wesleyan age was the summer of
[1:55:06] growth but the latest seen age is the
[1:55:09] harvest time of gathering
[1:55:14] it will gather the tares
[1:55:16] and it will gather the wheat
[1:55:20] but i say to you shalom bride
[1:55:23] because for this seed to ripen there had
[1:55:26] to be a light
[1:55:29] arise
[1:55:31] shine
[1:55:32] your light has come
[1:55:36] amen for the glory of the lord has risen
[1:55:40] on you you know what that glory means
[1:55:43] god's opinion of you
[1:55:45] god's opinion of you is exactly what he
[1:55:47] said in invisible union you're the
[1:55:50] sinless spot
[1:55:52] virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:55:56] you that have been filled with the holy
[1:55:58] ghost have been given the abstract title
[1:56:02] rising of the sun
[1:56:03] it gives you permission now
[1:56:06] it gives you permission
[1:56:08] when you have the abstract
[1:56:10] everything
[1:56:11] belongs to you
[1:56:15] come on
[1:56:16] everything
[1:56:18] healing's mine
[1:56:20] come on
[1:56:22] amen deliverance is mine joy is mine
[1:56:24] gentleness is mine meekness is mine
[1:56:26] everything that god is is you
[1:56:31] i don't care he says wherever that
[1:56:34] lineage came from he's talking about now
[1:56:37] your lineage you say well i i'm this way
[1:56:39] because of my father
[1:56:46] everybody got quiet there
[1:56:48] did you blame your dad for everything
[1:56:53] what i am is because of my mother's
[1:56:55] background brother bram said now when
[1:56:57] you've got the abstract it doesn't
[1:57:00] matter what mother's done
[1:57:03] it doesn't matter what father's done
[1:57:05] come on we're at harvest time
[1:57:07] we're getting away our babiness damn i
[1:57:10] got this problem when
[1:57:12] there's no more lamb it's no more cry
[1:57:15] speak it
[1:57:16] and it's yours
[1:57:18] drive the devil out
[1:57:21] we expect to fight
[1:57:23] we expect to fight
[1:57:26] when you start hey when you start having
[1:57:28] people get saved i kept on saying to the
[1:57:30] brothers you stay with them you stay
[1:57:31] with them because the minute
[1:57:34] they start to walk in christ the devil
[1:57:36] is there to kill that seed
[1:57:39] amen he's there to take that word out of
[1:57:41] your heart from last night and this
[1:57:43] morning and wednesday night and next
[1:57:45] sunday he is there it doesn't matter
[1:57:48] what your mother done it doesn't matter
[1:57:50] what your father done it doesn't matter
[1:57:52] what your grandmother done that's the
[1:57:54] i'm quoting here
[1:57:56] because people blame everybody
[1:57:58] just blame the devil but once you get
[1:58:00] the holy ghost
[1:58:02] it breaks that lineage and you get the
[1:58:05] blood of jesus christ you get the life
[1:58:07] of your heavenly father
[1:58:12] you mean i i don't have a right anymore
[1:58:14] to be
[1:58:15] mean and nasty
[1:58:20] daddy was mean so i mean
[1:58:22] really
[1:58:23] my daddy ate me
[1:58:26] my head my daddy's a loving heavenly
[1:58:28] father
[1:58:31] so the lineage gets broken doesn't
[1:58:32] matter what mother's done doesn't matter
[1:58:34] what father's done doesn't matter what
[1:58:35] my grandmother's done it doesn't matter
[1:58:38] when this when the abstract comes
[1:58:41] it omits everything
[1:58:44] and i'm an abstract holder i want you to
[1:58:48] say i'm an abstract holder
[1:58:52] at harvest time
[1:58:54] when satan is encamped about you
[1:58:56] to take away the word of god
[1:58:59] that god has given to you in this hour
[1:59:02] you tell that devil and look i'm square
[1:59:04] in the eye
[1:59:05] i am the grain of god
[1:59:08] i am the seed of god
[1:59:11] can i continue with this with the
[1:59:13] service here can i continue
[1:59:18] all
[1:59:20] my sins
[1:59:21] are gone
[1:59:26] so once you catch that revelation saint
[1:59:28] you'd actually probably get out of your
[1:59:30] seat
[1:59:30] mm-hmm
[1:59:32] yeah not a football getting thrown down
[1:59:34] for a hail mary
[1:59:37] did you see that he jumped i grabbed
[1:59:39] that ball
[1:59:41] you should be saying did you hear what
[1:59:43] that preacher said
[1:59:45] a prophet said you have no more sin
[1:59:49] [Applause]
[1:59:50] you're free you're guiltless forgiven
[1:59:54] forever
[1:59:56] hallelujah
[1:59:58] there is therefore no condemnation to
[2:00:01] them that are in christ jesus that walk
[2:00:03] not after the flesh but walk after the
[2:00:06] spirits
[2:00:07] i am a free
[2:00:08] son of god
[2:00:11] he called me virtuous he called me good
[2:00:14] he called me righteous he called me
[2:00:16] worthy
[2:00:18] and don't you ever let the devil tell
[2:00:19] you anything different
[2:00:23] hallelujah all sins are struck off all
[2:00:26] your sins are struck out by the blood of
[2:00:29] jesus christ the holy ghost has come the
[2:00:32] abstract title deed and god gives me by
[2:00:35] grace my the foreknowledge oh my what

[2:07:11] amen we are solid golden grain
[2:07:15] hallelujah
[2:07:17] the churches is in an erotic stage every
[2:07:20] church is proselyting pulling and
[2:07:21] fussing and stewing
[2:07:23] it's the churches not the bride brother
[2:07:26] brown is very clear on this
[2:07:28] the churches he says i no longer call
[2:07:30] you church i call you bride
[2:07:33] so the churches
[2:07:35] are proselyting the churches are pulling
[2:07:37] the churches are fussing the churches
[2:07:39] are stewing it's an erotic age but stand
[2:07:43] still

[2:07:50] that's
[2:07:51] the message masterpiece so the stalk the
[2:07:54] tassel and the husk
[2:07:57] never
[2:07:58] become seed
[2:08:02] so we see that it through
[2:08:04] wesley right
[2:08:06] justification sanctification so he's
[2:08:08] he's going through it very clearly in
[2:08:10] the masterpiece he said the stalk
[2:08:13] the tassel
[2:08:14] and the shock never
[2:08:17] become seed
[2:08:18] no
[2:08:20] but are all the time becoming more
[2:08:25] like the seed
[2:08:28] now at harvest time the seed is back
[2:08:31] to the original
[2:08:33] life

[2:10:28] the same net
[2:10:30] and the whole place goes
[2:10:33] they even paint themselves up craziness
[2:10:37] at least we don't do that
[2:10:41] but i know when you're preaching and
[2:10:43] something strikes your heart you respond
[2:10:46] brother brown said there she she got it

[2:11:15] token hour this is time to claim your
[2:11:17] sons i said if you gotta if you are
[2:11:20] praying for your son
[2:11:22] your daughter stand to your feet
[2:11:25] and this sister in the back she stood up
[2:11:27] to her feet and i said she doesn't even
[2:11:30] have a baby
[2:11:32] god gave her a baby
[2:11:39] hallelujah
[2:11:41] amen
[2:11:42] no prayer line no nothing just the word
[2:11:45] of god see thou stand for that which i
[2:11:49] don't even have but jesus gave her seed
[2:11:53] [Applause]
[2:11:54] glory
[2:11:57] we need to be a little bit more
[2:11:59] liberated saint we need to reach out
[2:12:01] into the realms of god
[2:12:04] this is what i believe we don't want to
[2:12:06] bring all formalism back into the
[2:12:08] message
[2:12:11] huh
[2:12:13] no i act out too much
[2:12:19] no it's it's it's it's the original life
[2:12:22] now
[2:12:22] the original life
[2:12:24] brother brown comes
[2:12:26] back in
[2:12:28] it's malachi 4.
[2:12:30] said it would be brought this way oh my
[2:12:33] we must have all
[2:12:36] to this way we must have all
[2:12:39] the word
[2:12:40] now what did he say in revelation 10
[2:12:43] would take place by that trip to tucson
[2:12:46] to open the church up open to the church
[2:12:49] in the days of the messenger of the
[2:12:50] seventh eighth angel
[2:12:52] and the seventh message
[2:12:54] the whole
[2:12:56] word
[2:12:57] of god
[2:12:58] will be manifested
[2:13:00] the seals
[2:13:02] that's what all the stock had left off
[2:13:05] and why all about it and what will be
[2:13:07] made manifest in time in this time
[2:13:10] at harvest time
[2:13:12] the seed
[2:13:14] is back to its original
[2:13:17] condition
[2:13:21] that's why he says in the rising of the
[2:13:24] sun
[2:13:26] she
[2:13:27] is
[2:13:28] him
[2:13:32] all that was in god he poured into
[2:13:34] christ
[2:13:35] and all that was in christ he poured
[2:13:38] into his church
[2:13:40] that was a tremendous testimony last
[2:13:42] night tremendous god's showing us he's
[2:13:45] in his people
[2:13:50] that was a home run
[2:13:52] that was bases loaded you're down to the
[2:13:55] last inning
[2:13:57] and there's a brother and he just had
[2:13:58] that side takes that bat and hits that
[2:14:00] devil right between the eyes
[2:14:04] amen
[2:14:07] why we're at the time we're at the end
[2:14:09] time brethren
[2:14:11] the word
[2:14:12] the word has become flesh
[2:14:18] exactly
[2:14:19] like it's been promised
[2:14:21] what did brother brown said say and see
[2:14:23] it's not is not heir with a shock and he
[2:14:26] corrects it actually if you take it you
[2:14:27] think about that title it should be
[2:14:29] reversed
[2:14:31] the seed is not air
[2:14:32] the shark doesn't have air it's not air
[2:14:35] to nothing
[2:14:36] so he corrects at the next service the
[2:14:37] next time he preaches it and he says now
[2:14:40] the shock is not there with the seed
[2:14:44] that says bonus
[2:14:52] so all the life
[2:14:54] is back in the seed
[2:14:57] and the son of man
[2:14:59] went forth sowing
[2:15:01] and he sowed the seed for the seventh
[2:15:03] age and here you are
[2:15:06] come to harvest time
[2:15:08] got it
[2:15:12] you got it
[2:15:14] i'm i'm the golden grain
[2:15:17] i'm the golden grain
[2:15:19] oh my
[2:15:20] listen to what he says invisible union
[2:15:23] do we have a few more minutes
[2:15:26] well you're gracious brother erickson
[2:15:29] everybody back home and say no
[2:15:36] i did not say that
[2:15:41] the life invisible union the life is in
[2:15:44] the grain
[2:15:45] again
[2:15:47] the same church the same thing
[2:15:50] the same word
[2:15:52] and so i said to the church back home i
[2:15:54] said take invisible union
[2:15:56] and read it monday
[2:15:58] you'll have victory
[2:15:59] then on tuesday pick it up again and
[2:16:01] re-read it then you'll have victory
[2:16:03] again
[2:16:04] then on wednesday read it again
[2:16:07] and they're looking at me like because i
[2:16:08] do that i tell them christmas to god
[2:16:10] reveal i can't i said how many times you
[2:16:12] read that hundreds
[2:16:13] and every time i read it it's like i've
[2:16:15] never read it
[2:16:16] i said why did i underline that pink
[2:16:18] purple green yellow
[2:16:21] i don't have any more colors to
[2:16:22] underline
[2:16:24] because as the word unfolds everything
[2:16:27] else unfolds with it
[2:16:31] and now what is uh now remember okay
[2:16:34] and i'm not pointing to tom
[2:16:37] e tommy
[2:16:41] where is the final voice
[2:16:45] where does brother brown say the final
[2:16:47] voice is
[2:16:48] he said the final under her messenger
[2:16:51] she is
[2:16:53] the final voice
[2:16:55] to the final age
[2:16:57] so then is it brother erickson preaching
[2:17:00] or is it god through brother erickson is
[2:17:03] it brother wayne preaching or is it go
[2:17:05] through the brother wing
[2:17:08] but we're we're still caught up in the
[2:17:09] veil
[2:17:11] get past the veil
[2:17:14] get past
[2:17:16] the veil
[2:17:17] the life is in the grain again
[2:17:19] i got the do you sing this song here ben
[2:17:22] i've got the life of god in me
[2:17:25] no i'll help you i don't even sing

[2:17:32] i got his life
[2:17:34] his nature
[2:17:35] and his ability i got the life of god in
[2:17:38] me
[2:17:43] bethany i know she's impressed
[2:17:48] isn't that true though
[2:17:50] if she's him the grain is back to the
[2:17:53] same word
[2:17:54] you can say the the grain that went in
[2:17:56] the ground christ went in the ground
[2:17:57] coming up through the church ages coming
[2:18:00] to full seat again that we can say the
[2:18:02] life of god's in me
[2:18:04] yeah i got the life of god in me glory
[2:18:08] i got his life his nature and his
[2:18:11] ability i've got the life of god in me
[2:18:18] sounds lovely
[2:18:20] not my voice i mean the words
[2:18:26] the life is in the grain again
[2:18:30] same church
[2:18:31] same thing
[2:18:33] same word
[2:18:35] the same word has sucked up through
[2:18:37] these and come out here
[2:18:40] come to a head here
[2:18:41] and the life that's come through here
[2:18:43] has picked up its people have you got
[2:18:46] that
[2:18:46] the word has come through here and has
[2:18:49] picked up its people
[2:18:53] picked up its people
[2:18:57] now
[2:18:58] it's forming into the head
[2:19:02] for what
[2:19:04] the rapture
[2:19:06] it's the same jesus
[2:19:09] get here we go
[2:19:10] how how many how many actually believe
[2:19:14] invisible union
[2:19:16] i know you do i know that's a crazy
[2:19:19] question
[2:19:20] but it's good for you to confess it
[2:19:23] so then what he says then
[2:19:25] it says it's the same jesus
[2:19:28] in bride form
[2:19:31] okay we got that but it doesn't stop
[2:19:33] there
[2:19:34] are you listening all mothers say amen
[2:19:37] all single sisters say amen
[2:19:40] and then we preach to the brothers and
[2:19:41] the sisters are left out i don't want to
[2:19:42] leave you out
[2:19:44] so now
[2:19:45] the same jesus
[2:19:48] in bright form
[2:19:51] with the same power
[2:19:56] can i give you another example
[2:19:58] here's the sister's got leukemia in the
[2:20:00] church
[2:20:01] i just heard that she's got
[2:20:04] a some problem
[2:20:05] i get a phone call and we need to pray
[2:20:08] for the sister
[2:20:09] and all of a sudden in the middle of the
[2:20:11] service i call out her name said now
[2:20:12] that thing on you is finished
[2:20:16] she stood to her feet
[2:20:18] and that leukemia spirit left her
[2:20:28] no different than our dear sister
[2:20:30] whose ankle gets broken that god puts in
[2:20:34] its position it's the same god
[2:20:38] same jesus
[2:20:40] bride formed
[2:20:41] with the same power
[2:20:44] is that we have to believe
[2:20:48] this is where it falls down to do you
[2:20:50] believe
[2:20:53] we believe
[2:20:55] amen
[2:20:56] then he goes on to say and get ready to
[2:20:59] close
[2:21:01] the bride
[2:21:03] knows where she stands
[2:21:09] the bride knows
[2:21:11] where she stands
[2:21:13] when you're in a business and you're
[2:21:15] running a business
[2:21:17] and you're where the buck stops
[2:21:20] i'm not talking about presidents because
[2:21:21] i know your mind goes there and
[2:21:23] everybody says the buck stops here but
[2:21:24] it doesn't really
[2:21:27] but in a real company
[2:21:30] when it comes down to it
[2:21:32] the buck stops at the owner
[2:21:37] the employee could have blown it
[2:21:40] lost you
[2:21:41] tons of money
[2:21:43] but because he's representing your
[2:21:46] company
[2:21:48] you take ownership to fault
[2:21:51] that's the way it used to be
[2:21:53] when i owned the company
[2:21:56] and sometimes well of course the
[2:21:58] brother's not working there now
[2:22:00] but
[2:22:01] it happens happens right
[2:22:04] but when you know you're in the right
[2:22:07] you can stand there
[2:22:09] because truth is truth right is right
[2:22:13] wrong is wrong
[2:22:18] and god always backs truth
[2:22:23] always
[2:22:24] truth
[2:22:26] and so now the truth is marching on
[2:22:31] stay with me truth is marching on
[2:22:35] and if you stay in truth
[2:22:38] r-c-e-o
[2:22:43] amen our five-star general
[2:22:47] he's gonna back up truce
[2:22:50] whether we blow it or not
[2:22:53] jesus is going to come on the scene
[2:23:01] that's why we call him a kind heavenly
[2:23:05] father
[2:23:14] the reason
[2:23:16] the light is shining gross dark rises
[2:23:19] high and the lights come right
[2:23:22] gross darkness the land
[2:23:24] grows darkness the people the bible says
[2:23:28] what that gross darkness you say well i
[2:23:30] can see pretty well out here i get up in
[2:23:31] the morning i don't see gross darkness
[2:23:34] well the gross darkness isn't the
[2:23:36] element of what we see
[2:23:38] it's in the element of the people
[2:23:42] so the gross darkness if you take a look
[2:23:44] at it you'll find out this darkness is
[2:23:47] attitude change
[2:23:50] and that is why satan's kingdom is
[2:23:53] suffering such a an abysmal
[2:23:56] attack in his kingdom to his people
[2:23:59] because brother brown said satan feeds
[2:24:01] on the flesh of his children
[2:24:04] so you'll have different things rise up
[2:24:07] and they got this saying and this new
[2:24:08] slang and this woke and this whatever we
[2:24:12] don't get it all into that stuff it's
[2:24:14] gross darkness the people because it's
[2:24:16] the attitude of the people that changes
[2:24:20] when i was in university in 1972
[2:24:23] if you said
[2:24:24] homo you're a you're
[2:24:26] homosexual
[2:24:30] it was not said in a question it was a
[2:24:33] really
[2:24:35] or you said it a little bit stronger
[2:24:37] than that but i don't want
[2:24:39] whomever might be listening to do
[2:24:41] whatever they do
[2:24:43] anyways
[2:24:44] it called it out
[2:24:46] that's wrong
[2:24:48] sodom's wrong
[2:24:50] and then it starts to change our
[2:24:51] attitude like i'm just gave you the
[2:24:53] example
[2:24:55] brother branham wasn't afraid of it
[2:24:58] i'm not afraid of it
[2:25:00] it's sodom
[2:25:02] it is absolute sod but the attitude of
[2:25:05] gross darkness changes people's attitude
[2:25:10] and they change their pronouns
[2:25:17] change pronoun
[2:25:19] and you say well how are you doing sir
[2:25:21] well you call me sir i'm a she
[2:25:27] i say you got an adam's apple
[2:25:35] does that not sound
[2:25:36] crazy and they're trying to make us
[2:25:39] think like them never
[2:25:42] we're the word
[2:25:46] we're the word as it was in the days of
[2:25:49] sodom socially being the days of the
[2:25:51] revealing of the son of man we have
[2:25:54] elohim and he stands behind troops
[2:26:02] see it you him what
[2:26:06] what
[2:26:08] i've been brought up in a wrong age
[2:26:10] but i know he's a he and she's a she
[2:26:14] and then it's in it
[2:26:19] i i don't know if i said last night or
[2:26:21] whatever but i was approached by
[2:26:23] somebody the other day and i looked at
[2:26:24] it and i go
[2:26:27] okay
[2:26:29] i'm afraid to say what you are
[2:26:32] have you ever come across that not here
[2:26:34] of course ohio is not as weird as
[2:26:36] vancouver let me tell you
[2:26:39] what are you
[2:26:41] so i had to get that's why he said i had
[2:26:42] to go down the list well the hair is cut
[2:26:44] like a woman
[2:26:46] dressed like a woman but adam's apple
[2:26:51] adam's apple gives them away every time
[2:26:57] it's craziness it's crazy we even have
[2:26:59] to think this way
[2:27:01] and we're the weirdos are you kidding me
[2:27:04] we're the weirdos
[2:27:06] you aren't the weirdos
[2:27:08] you are the virtuous
[2:27:11] amen we've come to the time when they
[2:27:14] call good bad and bad good
[2:27:17] it's time for a rapture
[2:27:21] i hear the combines coming
[2:27:25] hey
[2:27:26] man come on ruth come on ruth boaz is on
[2:27:30] the scene
[2:27:31] come on come on
[2:27:33] and the bible says that isaac dwelt at
[2:27:37] the well of abraham
[2:27:40] and when he drowned at the well of
[2:27:42] abraham his harvest was a hundred fool
[2:27:48] hallelujah i've been at the well of
[2:27:50] william branham
[2:27:56] and guess what my harvest
[2:27:59] is a hundredfold
[2:28:02] why because it was god that gave us as
[2:28:04] well

[2:29:36] i give you a little ending here
[2:29:39] okay
[2:29:40] brother brown said you know people are
[2:29:41] born singers
[2:29:43] so if you're born a singer
[2:29:45] you're a singer
[2:29:47] if you're not
[2:29:48] i'm proof of it
[2:29:51] you hear not
[2:29:52] if you're of the devil's seed you're of
[2:29:54] the devil's seed
[2:29:57] and if you're god's seed you're gonna
[2:29:58] see
[2:30:00] you either got it or you don't
[2:30:03] i got it
[2:30:06] i don't get it at the end of the service
[2:30:07] i got it
[2:30:10] so he says now people that are born
[2:30:12] to be singers they're singers
[2:30:15] some time ago i was buying my little
[2:30:17] girl a little piano for christmas
[2:30:20] seems like she was inclined to play
[2:30:23] music
[2:30:25] so i was standing there and my wife she
[2:30:27] can't play either
[2:30:30] and i was trying to pick out a cord on
[2:30:32] this little thing
[2:30:35] and a little boy came up to me about
[2:30:37] eight years old
[2:30:40] little shoes were off his feet and his
[2:30:42] hairs needed a trimming very bad
[2:30:46] it was down to his shoulder sort of a
[2:30:48] raggedy coat on
[2:30:50] stood there and looked at me
[2:30:53] a little bit and said what are you
[2:30:55] trying to do mister
[2:31:01] what are you trying to do only brother
[2:31:02] brown way to do it
[2:31:04] you know here he is on a piano you know
[2:31:06] trying to find a piano for his daughter
[2:31:07] for and this little raggedy boy long
[2:31:09] hair there just coat you know shoes off
[2:31:11] and what are you trying to do mister
[2:31:18] what are you trying to do he said
[2:31:20] i'm trying to make this chord
[2:31:23] you know there's a g chord i can do g
[2:31:25] chord
[2:31:26] that's the simplest chord i know how to
[2:31:28] do a g chord but brother bram didn't
[2:31:29] apparently
[2:31:32] he said i'm trying to make this chord he
[2:31:34] said
[2:31:35] he said let me have it
[2:31:38] well i thought what poor little ignorant
[2:31:42] child like that know anything about a
[2:31:43] panel
[2:31:45] is your prophet
[2:31:48] oh my
[2:31:50] he was a master with it
[2:31:54] an eight-year-old boy it's either in you
[2:31:57] or it's not
[2:31:59] you either got it
[2:32:01] or you don't
[2:32:02] you're either seed
[2:32:04] or you're not
[2:32:07] so
[2:32:08] he got on there
[2:32:11] and he started to play
[2:32:14] he walked over them to this xylophone
[2:32:17] picked it up and played silent night
[2:32:21] i never heard anything like it
[2:32:24] then he took about a six or eight inch
[2:32:27] piece of a gas pipe
[2:32:30] really
[2:32:32] a gas pipe
[2:32:35] took a six inch or eight inch piece of a
[2:32:37] gas pipe laying there in the hardware
[2:32:39] store he blowed the star spangled banner
[2:32:42] through the pipe
[2:32:48] all right
[2:32:49] here's a prophet trying to play a piano
[2:32:51] what are you trying to do mister
[2:32:54] he said i'm trying to get a card step
[2:32:57] aside
[2:32:58] you ragged ignorant kid what do you tell
[2:33:01] a prophet what to do
[2:33:04] huh and he starts playing he says music
[2:33:07] like i never heard before goes over to
[2:33:09] the xylophone and starts playing the
[2:33:10] xylophone then all of a sudden he gets
[2:33:12] his pipe sits in along star spangled
[2:33:14] banner
[2:33:21] can you imagine there's a prophet
[2:33:23] awestruck over in because it was in him
[2:33:27] come on come on people it is in you
[2:33:31] you are the mighty bride of valor
[2:33:36] gideon didn't know he had it in him
[2:33:39] i didn't know i had it in me
[2:33:41] you didn't know he had it in me you
[2:33:46] but then the angel came down
[2:33:49] said it's in you
[2:33:50] and now you're playing a different kind
[2:33:52] of music
[2:33:53] called the heavenly music
[2:33:56] you're playing the word
[2:34:00] hallelujah
[2:34:02] he said son
[2:34:04] have you ever had a music lesson
[2:34:09] he said what's that
[2:34:13] you ever been to church before
[2:34:16] you just ask me that if you want
[2:34:19] what's that
[2:34:21] i don't know what church was
[2:34:24] i saw them i walked in them walked out
[2:34:26] of them
[2:34:29] but there was something else that was
[2:34:31] laying deep within
[2:34:33] it wasn't a six inch pipe
[2:34:36] or an eight inch pipe
[2:34:39] it was the word of god
[2:34:41] that was laying there for you and me to
[2:34:43] play
[2:34:44] he was born a musician
[2:34:47] it was just a gift to know how to do it
[2:34:50] you were born to be a believer
[2:34:54] you were born to be the elected lady of
[2:34:58] the bride of jesus christ you were born
[2:35:01] for the rapture
[2:35:02] and may god bless you
[2:35:05] and encourage you in the faith

[2:36:25] predestinated also to have prepared good
[2:36:27] ground for the seed to grow in
