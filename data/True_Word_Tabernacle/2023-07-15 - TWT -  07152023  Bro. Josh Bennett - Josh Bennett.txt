feel his presence and come and amen we want to thank you all for that wonderful song Amen it's been a great blessing we've just been studying that scripture a little bit lately here and brother Brown said when Jesus said come unto me all you 've been labor and heavy laden I'll give you rest he said the rest he was going to give him was Zoe life he said he had a rest with a refreshing with stammering lips another tongue shall I give unto this my people amen and I I know that he's good for his promise amen just come taste and see amen that he's good amen we've had a passing in the in the bride of Christ our sister Lily Bontrager sometimes you know where his mom Bontrager passed away and they're going to have a funeral for her on July 17th the visitation will be as Monday July 17th the

her and love her and want a tremendous testimony in life amen so if you're able to go I'm sure the family would appreciate that amen tonight we are um we're blessed to have brother Joshua Bennett with us a minister preacher message of the hour Amen brother Josh and I've been Muslim friends for years and years and and I've seen I've seen the character of Christ amen in a in an end time and a gift that God has placed in his life and he pastors a church there in Hickory North Carolina or Newton North Carolina many of you know brother Josh it's Apostolic Tabernacle they just finished building the church actually and just had their dedication meetings in June amen we were able to go down and be a part of that and it's a real blessing to have him with us tonight also he brought sister Kimberly with him thank you sister Kimberly for coming and the girls and I think Hannah and Abigail maybe Emma in the middle there appreciate you all coming and being a part of our service tonight and amen that brother Josh would take time to come amen I know you all are going to be greatly blessed amen and I I was just thinking about it on the way to church and I was thinking about in the times of Jesus when the Bible talks about when Jesus was to pass by away and when he was to go through a certain way there would always be a crowd around there'd be people and and I've often think of that one little lady who was having the issue of blood and when Jesus was going by she said I just want to touch you [Music] if you study the history on it she really wasn't allowed to because of her uncleanliness or condition but there was something in her heart to believe that if she could just touch it she didn't want to maybe disturb the crowd or anybody even know that she did it but something in her heart believed if I could just touch it and you know the Messiah is passing by this way tonight [Music] as some believe that our Messiah is dead but on the third day he rose again and brother Graham said it's not some man here is the messiah but his spirit William Branham proved without one question that the Messiah is still alive today and that he can still be touched the same way that that woman touched him in that street you could touch him tonight he used to pass this way you said brother Wayne how do I touch him well when this man of God comes to this pulpit you know him as brother Josh I know him as brother Josh but God deposited a gift in that man's life [Music] and that gift is put here for the body of Christ and when you begin to pull on that gift the holy spirit will take a hold of the man and he'll begin to use him in that office will begin to open up and things that you've prayed about you've questioned you've desired you're sitting here with a need and you can reach out and touch the Messiah and brother Josh won't even know maybe what he's saying in the Holy Spirit of direct him a certain way and you'll know you'll know that that's him and he's here and he's in the midst of it say man I believe he could be touched tonight don't you believe it would you reach out when he comes passing by tonight say Lord I want you to touch me I want you to touch my need amen how many needs a miracle tonight need a miracle here tonight I was just this song was on my heart coming to church and I was just thinking about miracles and and the and the need and this little song just came on my heart there's a miracle in the making amen I think it actually has one verse that it talks about that woman there's a miracle [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] here we go for you okay all that a miracle in the making sure you you the father is [Music] your prayers have been heard yes [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] she imagines [Music] thank you this is the important part here [Music] your miracles [Music] there's a miracles [Music] [Music] for you father is [Music] today [Music] you believe that amen you believe that he's still still a miracle-working god and I believe this just uh you know how many is glad you're serving a true Living God Amen y'all know that got any rivers you think are uncrossable let's just try to sing that tonight how many glad God Specializes and things thought impossible amen [Music] God's specializes in things [Music] he'll do what no other [Music] can listen like this now got any Affliction [Music] you thank God incurable when the doctor has done all that he can do God's Specializes in things impossible he'll do for you no other weather [Music] just Reach Out And Touch the Lord foreign [Music] today is [Music] [Music] you'll find he's not too busy [Applause] [Music] for thank you Lord [Music] Reach Out And Touch the Lord let's see close by us Lord Jesus Lord we're so glad that you can be touched Lord your word says that you're a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities tonight Lord I I'm reminded of the scripture Lord that you pass by a place one time and there was a great crowd that gathered around and what the scripture said everyone that touched you was healed was made whole Lord I pray that it could be that kind of meeting tonight Lord we know Lord that you can be touched Lord I pray God that we just reach out in the spirit tonight take a hold of the Hem of your garment and Lord I pray that everyone that touches you Lord will be May hold tonight Lord just touch those that are sick and minister to the hearts of your children God I pray Lord that you'll be the preacher and Lord we'll be the hearers and Lord that as we hear the word God that Lord we'd open up our hearts and Lord we know God that lord it's not just the natural hearing that we come Lord to hear the word with our natural ears but God he that hath an ear let them hear but the spirit is saying to the church Lord I pray you'll give us spiritual understanding tonight Lord May our spiritual ears be open Lord and Lord I pray that that word would just Lord go forth in power and Lord we're just praying tonight that it would strike that Mark hit the target Lord that would meet the need Lord you you know the needs of this congregation Lord I don't know Lord the things that maybe they're they're facing or Lord what's laying here tonight God the Lord of situations or whatever it may be but you're the omniscient one Lord You're the all-knowing God and Lord I pray that you can just take control Lord tonight and Lord just move me to the side Lord Lord Lord I pray you had me behind the cross oh God that Lord that your word Lord can be spoke on human lips God that we would just be a vessel Lord that you could use tonight Lord and you'd Minister Lord Lord we'll be so careful God Lord that when it's all done and Lord the final amen has been said Lord we'll be so careful to give you all the glory and all the honor Lord we'll give you all the thanks and all the praise Lord for you alone are worthy and we ask these things now in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you amen just honored to be here with you and amen we always counted a great honor to be here and so you just pray that the Lord will help us and I told my church at home I asked them to pray for me I said if I can just find a way to relax and you know a lot of times when you when I Minister other places I get so nervous and and I I try so hard I think sometimes but I just want to relax and if that's okay I'm just going to try to preach like I'm at home tonight amen and so um you just I pray I trust if I can relax and you can relax then God can just have his way amen but let's just turn in our Bibles tonight to the book of Philippians foreign Philippians chapter 2 and I'm also going to read one verse out of First Corinthians the second chapter very familiar scriptures that we're looking at this evening and just some things that the Lord's been dealing with me I just had on my heart for some time and and so we uh just uh want to look at this tonight Philippians 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made of himself no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the cross amen First Corinthians the second chapter just one verse there verse 16. I just love for this chapter the whole chapter is just powerful but I love this verse for who had known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen how many is glad that you have the mind of Christ I mean you can have your seats this evening I want to speak to you for a few minutes by God's help on the mind of Christ in an age of insanity and how many how many believes that you're living in an age of insanity you know it's called the information age uh or it's also known as a computer age or the digital age and um this age they actually have marked the beginning of this age of information uh they've linked it to discoveries that were made there in 1947 which I thought that was very interesting that that they would link it to that year in particular because we know that you know it's uh the first recordings that we have of our Prophet was in that year but they have marked this as an age of information and and and and there's never been a time on the earth that information is shared the way it is in this age and and and you know how that you know the whole world has been uh the whole globe has been linked together and and communication is uh become so possible because of the technology that we have and the way the information is shared but so it's an age of of great knowledge and and they claim it to be an age of great understanding but but you know I I believe that it was prophesied in the scripture Daniel spoke of it there in Daniel 12 and 4 uh where the Bible says but thou Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end so we know that this is an end time scripture amen and it says that many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased amen and so we know that that's true Brother Band would even say there in the message this day this scripture is fulfilled he said he he takes that he says it's the increase in science scientific research he said now at one time my grandfather went to see my grandmother in an ox cart and now it's in a jet plane or even in orbit into the air into outer space and who said this Daniel chapter Daniel 12 and 4 knowledge shall increase in the last days and we see the hour that we're living in as to continue edition of the world the condition of Science and now a prophet's telling you that the the increase of knowledge on the earth and the scientific uh achievements is a sign of the end time amen then the Bible also says in the in the New Testament there in second Timothy 3 and verse 7 that they would be ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of the truth so amen this would be an age or a time of great knowledge where men would be ever learning amen and their knowledge as far as the the knowledge of the world would be increasing all the time amen but they would never come to the knowledge of the truth so we know by these scriptures that the knowledge that Daniel's talking about is not the knowledge of God Amen it's not the wisdom of God Amen but it's the knowledge of man and amen and it will continue to increase until the time of the end and and but yet even though that they would be ever learning and how many believes that man is in this this this scripture here in second Timothy is being fulfilled in this hour that man is ever learning but but they're not able to come to the knowledge of Truth so they have no understanding of the word amen matter of fact the smarter they get the further away from God they get is that true brother Rand would say it this way it shows us that it's not just learning we can't even listen I'll just say it this way even us as Believers we just don't come and sit down even just to learn the scriptures or amen or to get an intellectual understanding of the word amen that is not what's going to give you power over the devil but the prophet said it would be Revelation see amen and Revelation is not just you don't sit down and learn Revelation Revelation is sovereignly given to a Believer by the spirit of God amen how many is thankful for the Revelation amen but you see the difference in brother Brown said he said see ever learning said brother we got seminaries we got schools we got phds and dhds and ddds and Q STS I I don't even know what all these stand for but amen all kinds of everything ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth that's right amen we've got doctors degrees and we send our children away to a seminary somewhere and get some great big degree or something other like that amen and there's still something wrong so amen he said even after all that there's something missing I thought this was just uh outstanding that brother man would say this he said the devil knows more about the Bible than you'll ever know I tell you that now he knows all about amen some of the best Bible students I ever met were infidels even they just study it day and night to fuss with you about it the Bible isn't to be fussed about the Bible is to be lived amen I tell you I I hate to say it this way and don't think I'm being too critical but I've met some message people that sometimes you know they know a lot about the message and they study the message a lot but for what purpose amen because they'll stand there and argue with you all day long about the quotes but amen but is it becoming a life and you see amen is it is it is it more than just amen you know knowing how much knowledge you can can gain or retain in your mind or amen what you can recall by memory amen or is it a revelation that God has placed down in your heart see even that is what the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against amen but you see as we look at this it's an age of of knowledge it's an age of understanding it's the information age amen but brother uh uh uh Brandon would go to the scripture here in Revelations 3 and he begins to show the condition of the laodicean church age and I'm just going to read it Revelations 3 and 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the laodice right these things saith thee amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou work cold or hot so then because they are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest see that I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and no it's not this is what I want you to catch and no it's not that thou art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked now amen it's one thing to be in that condition but it is something different to be in that condition and not know it brother Brown would say how you know that's quite a condition to be in Amen to be naked and you don't know it they meant to be blind and you don't know it amen remember the man that come to brother Brandon one day and said you know talk about the power of God and if you who or you claim you are and I'll strike me blind brother Ben said how could I do it you are already blind amen but he didn't know that he was in that condition amen and you got a whole world of people out here even that are in a condition of uh uh they're naked and they're and they're wretched and they're miserable and amen and all this but they don't know that they're in that condition amen it shows you amen the the that the age is going is falling into insanity amen you know in the church age but he would go back to this scripture and he said how fitting are the characteristics of this last age to represent the age in which we now live even there the name laodicea means the people's rights or the Justice of the people and amen and we know that there's never been a time on the Earth where people are are so caught up in their rights and everybody's got their rights I mean you know uh the homosexuals has got their rights and and the transgenders got their right and every group and every amen everybody that you can think of they got their rights and and they're demanding more rights all the time amen because it's the spirit of the age but but listen that's not just because it's the spirit of the age don't mean it's the spirit of Christ just because it's the spirit of the church don't mean that it's the right spirit because brother Brown comes along says listen amen we are lambs amen we're we're the Sheep of his pasture amen and we forfeit our rights amen that's a real Christian right there amen you got it right brother and says to the American you got a right to do anything you want to do you got a right to go down and drink and smoke and amen you can wear what you want to wear and you can go where you want to go amen that's your American right amen but as a Son of God you forfeit that right Hallelujah and surrender your life amen to the word of God is that right amen but it's the age of people's rights now he goes on to say amen he talks about the city because remember there was amen there was seven churches and Seven Cities and and those cities even those cities themselves would represent a a condition of of the age is that right and and the City of laodicea was rich and it was endued with uh wealth and it was full of culture and Science abounded and Brethren said how like today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead amen culture and education has taken the place of a spirit-given word and faith has been superseded by science so that man has become a victim of materialism and every attribute anciently ought to sit or laodicea is found reborn in the 20th century amen I see an age so that city was representing an age or a a church age a span of time amen and look amen as he shows this amen they had an attitude they had a a a condition and they had a testimony if you'd call it that amen they were saying we have need of nothing amen we're rich and increasingly good and don't need nothing amen and watch what the prophet said he said when somebody says I have need of nothing he could be very well saying I have everything or he could be saying I don't want any more as I am now full amen you can express it any way you want to but it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent she is satisfied in what she has or either figures she has it all or has enough is that right and that's exactly what we find today amen what denomination is it is or that's not claiming that it has a revelation and the power and The Truth Listen to The Baptists and they have it all listen to the methodists and they have it on listen to the Church of Christ and every one of them is Rome amen but and you hear the Pentecostals and they say that they have the fullness of the fullness is that right amen he said now I know they know I'm telling the truth about them because even there ain't one of their manuals that don't say different amen they wrote it all out just put it nice put their names to it finish it all up amen and God just don't have any more see amen they come they said this is what we have amen is that what they're saying they're they're putting a period behind it they're they're saying we got it we got the revelation we got the truth amen we got the answer amen but see watch as he says this he said they wrote it all out finish it all up and said God ain't got no more and then there's those who just don't want no more even they don't believe in healing it wouldn't want it although it's in the word there's those that would not take the Holy Spirit if God opened up the heavens and showed them a sign amen now they're saying and trying to prove that they have it all or that they have enough yet is that the truth amen compare this 20th century Church to the first century church just go ahead and do that where's the power where's the love where's that purified church that withstood sin and walked with faith toward Jesus where's the unity you can't find it if this church has all it needs then why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts and so they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than what they have today that's a good question ain't it amen at the Modern church out here amen has all they need amen then why amen was it that in the book of Acts amen that they were crying out even you find just amen there in Acts chapter four amen right after they've been filled with the Holy Ghost they were already crying for a refilling of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen and I like what the promise says he's showing you amen if we amen if the modern church has enough amen has always all it needs amen then then why are we not measuring up then what to what the first church had Hallelujah he says see that was all their estimation but God saw something entirely different amen he said that if they said that they were rich and increased with goods and spiritually wealthy that they had arrived they hadn't need another but God saw it otherwise he said you don't know this but you're wretched miserable poor blind and naked and when people are that way especially naked and don't know it there has to be something awfully wrong listen rich and you say well brother you know I don't know exactly what you're talking about well I'll tell you just just next time you see a a woman out there in a pair of shorts tell her she's naked and see what kind of response you get amen they'll look at you like you're crazy but she's as naked as she can be according to the word of God in God's eyes she's naked amen but she don't know it wouldn't believe it if you told her amen but friends I'm just pointing that out to you amen what the condition of the women out here is only showing you the spiritual condition of the church amen why are they cutting off their hair amen why are they doing these things amen amen because it's a representation of the condition of a church the church is rejected the Hashem of Jesus Christ amen they have fulfilled their scripture amen of the church allowed to see it and put Christ on the outside amen can you say Amen ABA and as a result of that she is wretched miserable poor and blind and naked and don't even know it God says this age is wretched how strange how strange in an age of Plenty in an age of progress in an age of abundance How can there be trials that we we well now it's strange but in this age of plenty of opportunity when everybody has so much and there's so much more to be had with all the inventions to do our work and so many things uh to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation I just read a a a a a a study that there's a mental health crisis in this nation especially among the young people especially in particular among young girls and they said this they saw a sharp a very sharp increase I I could have brought it with me but I know I ain't got time so I didn't but amen I give all the uh statistics but they saw a very sharp increase of mental health uh uh uh uh decline around the year 2010 and they linked it to the to the uh the smartphone coming out and and they begin to tie this with social media and and and all these channels Outlets of social media and you think you know a thing that was supposed to make your life easy and connect everybody and you know and it's so good and you know and it should just bring joy and happiness amen but look what it's done amen and they showed this and amen this this country right now is in a mental health crisis suicide depression anxiety amen we we all these things are on a sharp increase and they keep going climbing higher and higher every year and it's not just in the young people it's in the adults the ram said when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pep pills in the morning rushing the doctors entertaining institutions trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yet this age boasts of tremendous stores of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever this age uh boasts of spiritual attainments whether people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts a better moral values but is more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about knowledge and science but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and souls and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that's come upon the Earth in one Generations we've gone all the way from a horse and buggy age to a space age and we're proud about it boastful about it but inside is a Dark Void Cavern that's crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing them for fear the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of the neurotics it boasts but it can't back it up it cries peace but there is no peace it crossed uh amen that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with a desire like an unsatisfied fire amen there is no peace saith my God for the wicked what's it all about brother Brown comes along and he he preaches letting off the pressure and he said what it is is a pressure pressing the people and by the way he said nobody escapes it the young the middle Asia oh I don't care who you are you're feeling the pressure I'm just glad tonight you got a place to let it off Hallelujah I mean he's glad amen there's a place that a Believer can come and let the pressure off amen and he goes on to say he said and the doctors ain't got the answer and the psychiatrist ain't got that answer he says a matter of fact the psychiatrists are being treated by other psychiatrists even they don't have the answer but there's got to be an answer even he goes on in The Invisible union he said a few years ago if a mother or even them would have walked out on the streets the way some of these women walk out even even church members and and they'd lock the woman up for being insane why they'd say she forgot to put on her skirt well if it was insane then it's insane now amen well look the whole world proves it's insane look at the murders and the things that's going on in the world today it's Insanity the whole thing is coming to fulfill Revelations amen see it's complete total incentive this world we're going through right away it's almost there now now that's 1965. amen you see the footsteps of it amen there it is marching right out on the streets right down to the church View total insanity I'm just going to ask the question how much worse would it have to get for us to say we're here I'm telling you we've arrived you're living in the hour amen Total Insanity it's took the minds of the people there's a reason amen I hope this is all right tonight but I I'll just say it straight you know you got all these movements and these little things and amen you know you got transgenders and amen and they even it don't matter how they were born or even now we're being told that you're chill you're chill they want to teach our children that they can choose what gender they they want to be amen Elizabeth that choice has already been made that decision's already been made I like I seen a sign back home on a church sign it says if you don't like the way you were born try being born again Hallelujah I say there's a good answer if you don't like the way you're born amen try being born again amen but you got you know the transgender and then that that ain't the end of it now they got fluid uh you know uh gender and you know and and that they're just a gender fluid rather they you know that and and that they're just depends on how they feel amen according to whatever day it is they may wake up one day and be a man wake up tomorrow and be a woman or whatever listen that ain't even the end of now you got people identifying themselves as animals and amen and all other kind of Elizabeth it's insanity I make no apology to say it's total insanity this world has dropped off into insanity hallelujah amen amen listen amen there's no other way to describe it there's no other way amen that you could describe amen her politics and amen and and their agendas and and the things that they're pushing amen it goes beyond any uh you know thing that you could comprehend in your mind amen the condition that the world is in the condition that the people are in amen but it's fulfilling prophecy Hallelujah amen and the world is in total insanity but I want to tell you tonight there ain't been one hope there's only one hope even but amen I'll show it to you in the Bible amen because there was a man amen in the scripture amen over in the country of the gadarians amen and the scripture said even that he has stripped himself naked amen and he was sleeping in the house he meant he was out there in the tombs and they and everything they tried to do amen they couldn't contain him he'd break the chains he had break the ball amen Elizabeth he was in an insane condition but down inside of him was a soul Hallelujah and he was crying out to God and Jesus crossed Land and Sea to go to that place for a white man Hallelujah let me just say this tonight and all this Insanity of this world and the condition of this world in if there's a soul that's crying out for God he'll cross Land and Sea to come to thy soul to deliver them Hallelujah Jesus went over there and he found that man amen bound with a legion of devils amen and them demons recognize him and they said why do you come to torment us before the time amen they know something about who he was I mean come on Church they knew something about who he was Why'd You Come to torment us before the time amen and they and they begin to plead with the Lord even don't just send us out give us a body to go in give us a place to go amen and he saw a bunch of swine over there amen and I love the scripture because Jesus amen he didn't Stand There Brother Ray he didn't call him amen he didn't take that man and I'm not trying to preach against nothing or amen you know I believe in prayer lines and I believe it in a move of God everybody knows me knows I believe in that I believe in a move of God I believe in the power of the Holy Ghost we got that clear tonight amen but Jesus just stood there that's the word hallelujah and he spoke to them Devils with authority and he said go he didn't have to preach two hours he didn't have to scream and holler come on church he didn't have to pour buckets all amen he just said go and they went all right and the man was delivered and the Bible says amen when they found him he was clothed and in his right mind Hallelujah brother I tell you what you ever get delivered from the insanity this age you'll be clothed you won't be taking clothes off you'll be putting clothes on you're becoming yourself amen spiritually and naturally amen yes sir amen you'll be found close in your right mind you know what the trouble is the trouble is is a modern church it's just like that bunch in that City because they saw what the Lord done in a Revival will come listen Jesus come over there delivered a man they knew as a supernatural because they went telling people about it amen amen what a great miracle would take but they saw the supernatural they knew it had to be something real had to be God but you know what they done instead of Amen you had a thought something like this happened you think man amen they've been pleading with him come once you come to our church next week amen we'll start a we'll start a Revival right now we'll have a Tuesday night service we'll we'll take it until hey come on over here even let's even we'll call all the sick and and the needy we know other people that are bound and oppressed let's go get them bring them to you Lucifer they didn't do none of this they begin to plead with him that he would leave their Coast you know why because it was going to cost them some Hawks it was gonna cost them some pigs it was going to cost some they meant a little bit of income it was gonna listen for us he's a lot of people don't want no Revival because it's gonna cost you some pride it's gonna cost you're gonna have to humble yourself you're gonna have to submit yourself amen oh yes sir I know what I'm talking about people see the supernatural they know it's God they know it's real they know it's the power of God but they don't want it because of course it's too great so instead inviting them to come they invited him to leave I want to tell you it's the only hope for this insane age you ain't gonna work you ain't gonna get out of it reading a book come on you you ain't gonna get out of this psychology ain't gonna help you even joining the church ain't going to help you let me tell you religion ain't gonna ain't the answer there's only one answer and that's Jesus Christ [Applause] there's only one answer to this incentive it's the mind of Christ think about a boy brother real talks about a a testimony he's over in Africa and remember the story amen they bled this boy up there Amen to brother Brown said like a dog on the uh let him with a chain and they brought him up on a like a dog and he said he had been born that way is in that condition of his life amen and just total brother Brown said total amen didn't have no uh mental capabilities at all even walk like an animal couldn't talk all the condition they let him literally even like a dog on the platform and brother Brown looked at him and he said but he was thinking in that condition thank God for her message in that condition the prophet of God said that boy was thinking about his brother that had fell off of a yellow goat or that's what he said he saw an event he said her yellow dog or a yellow goat and he had injured himself and that boy in that condition being led as a dog it completely amen insane as far as you can see let's see down inside there was a soul that was crying out Hallelujah let me tell you this ought to encourage some of y'all tonight because some of us got loved ones and and children and and family and the last time you saw him their hair was green and they had amen earrings and nose rings and every other kind of thing amen but brother if there's something down in their soul that's crying out for God I don't care how it's safe I don't care how crazy I don't get out lost [Applause] after God we'll answer Hallelujah not boy even that condition had his brother on his heart he was thinking about his brother that was a because of a fall and brother random saw a vision and he said I see a boy amen and he told the vision thus say the Lord he's healed he said about a city blocker away he heard an uproar amen of the in the crowd and hear that boy come running completely healed by the power of God even now This Boy's over here Amen on the platform amen down on his hands and his knees like a dog chain around his neck amen but another Vision breaks and brother Branham sees that boy standing upright in his right mind and he begins to speak the word over him hallelujah amen amen but I tell you what got me Amen brother Brown's telling that one place he said and that boy is down there and brother Ray he had never stood he had never stood on his feet the right way even he had never stood up like like that amen but a prophet reached down he said I reached down and took a hold of the chain and lifted him up Hallelujah and he lifted that boy up on his feet he said the tears flowing out of his eyes and he stood for the first time in his right mind oh brother I don't know if you're seeing yourself yet but I was lost in an insane world and whether you know it or not even if it wasn't for the grace of God there we'd be tonight but the grace of God reached down a hand and lifted us up Hallelujah and here we are tonight amen clothed and in our right mind an age of insanity but you have the mind of Christ look at this in the message leadership brother Brown said oh God let me go Lord don't leave me behind let me go with you father I don't want to stay here on this Earth and watch these tribulations coming on I don't want to stay here in this insanity I don't want to stand here with them hideous sights you know brother Brown said Hollywood is producing it now amen amen Locust with hair like lies amen uh amen or I'm sorry hair amen uh teeth like lines you know what I'm talking about and brother but the prophet of God said amen they'll have hair to haunt the women that cut theirs off amen these beasts and things and brother Brown said amen people are losing their mind look at a man trying to act like a beast and look like beasts and women trying to look like animals for instance was 1965. and then somebody come along and tell you amen that the message needs to be updated this message is more right now than it was when he said it come on Church listen to this Prophet amen he talks about things that make more sense in 2023 than it did in 1965. this message don't need no facelift it don't need no update your Revelation is what needs updated trying to look back animals paint on their face knowing that these things are predicted to happen things that will they'll go into in they'll go so insane until Locust will rise up with hair like women to haunt the women teeth like lions even things that you you've said amen and that the mental condition of the people will be completely gone and we see it in the making right now he said oh Lord help us restore us restore is this your prayer tonight restore us to the same mind of Christ Jesus our lord insanity but we have the mind of Christ listen friends because this is the age this you're not living in the feet age the church has moved up amen moved all the way up brother around bring it all the way up to the tongues and Pentecost moved all the way up to the eyes I see a prophet how many believe this is true but above them knives there's no more moving parts amen only the intelligence itself the mind amen and then he says we have no intelligence of Our Own hallelujah amen listen amen was he tying this into the headship of Christ coming down in the body you're living in that age now we're beginning to see what was in God's mind brother Brown was saying Christ's a mystery in the back part of God's mind a hidden Mystery in the back part friends I don't know if you know how blessed you are when you begin to hear this message you're not hearing the thoughts of a man let me tell you I know the devil hates this but I'm gonna say it tonight amen a prophet when a word Prophet amen this Prophet that we're following is a word prophet this is not a gift of Prophecy this is not your common Pentecostal prophet amen this is a word Prophet a dispensational prophet amen and we're in a word Prophet begins to speak it is not God inspiring that man's mind or inspiring his thoughts it's God completely bypassing his mind altogether and the mind of God is being expressed to the mouth of a man Hallelujah let me tell you some church this message didn't come out of Jeffersonville it didn't come out of Kentucky it's not the thoughts of William Bradham this comes from the might of God hallelujah amen that's why I can stand as a preacher and tell you this and I as Paul said we have the mind of Christ hallelujah amen we know what God had in his mind a prophet has gone to reveal to us the very mind of God [Music] watch what he said speaking of discernment he said that's not mind reading it's not psychology I'll Grant you this is psychology in this way pasaki means your course of mind it's the mind of Christ and a human being has had a privilege to enter in and know the mind of Christ he said Hallelujah and I say hallelujah tonight amen how many scratch you had the privilege to enter in now I know I got to be careful in my time but am I right so far I'm just now where I want to be spend a lot of time getting here didn't I but I'm just where I want to be right now even because of Paul says let this mind be in you Amen in other words amen that word means don't prevent don't hinder remove all obstacles now brother Brown because the law says you can't have his mind in your mind at the same time so the only way you're gonna have to mind to Christ is you got to lose your mind come on friends you gotta lay down your thinking you gotta Surrender Your Ideas you got to forget about your thoughts let this man the Amplified Bible says it this way have this same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus I like that have the same attitude that Jesus Christ had even what was it amen but being in the form of God and not robbery to be equal with God Jesus was not taking anything away from God to be equal with him can I tell you this way he was not stealing a position that didn't belong to him he said he was not he meant taking something amen that was not rightfully his he thought in our robbery to be equal with God and now Apostle Paul says let this man be in you Hallelujah Brother Brad said let's go beyond our own thinking let's go by the thinking of God and the Bible says let this mind that was in Christ be in you so think his thoughts not our own thinking because most of the time we're wrong how many can say Amen to that brother Brown said when you think you got it all figured out you're wrong so he says let's think his thoughts another place he says people say them people are crazy the reason are they are is they ain't got the mind of the world anymore they got the mind of Christ Hallelujah and when you have the mind of Christ the world's going to call you crazy watch what brother Brown says Identify Masterpiece I'm now identified in the baptism of the Holy Ghost not something out there here it's on the streets something 40 years ago I have it right now and the glory of power of God and forgiveness of sins I see him heal the sick open up blinded eyes I see them foretell things and read hearts of the people I'm identify with him in his ministry at this day glory to God I'm identifying with him for the Deliverance in the last days I trust to be a part of that great bride that's coming some of these days no matter what the world may say they may call us crazy hysterical beelzebos Heretics whatever they want to be amen but I still want to be identified with that group I'm still here I'll remain there I was born there I want to stay there I'll always be there because God placed me there I left my church to come identify myself with a bunch of holy rollers and I am one of them Hallelujah is there anybody with me tonight amen I am one of them say brother will you tell I'm one of them Holy Rollers I'm one of them Holy Ghost Field Acts 2 38 amen Believers amen Abra that the prophet of God taught about tongue talking yes sir I'm ashamed of it I'm one of them I'm identified there yes sir they say Billy you lost your mind maybe I did but I found the mind of Christ hallelujah amen I found them I found his word I found his presence I found that he is the same yesterday today and forever I don't care what anybody else thinks about it come on Friends you've got to get to the place even that you ain't worried about your neighbor you ain't worried about your boss you ain't worried about it somebody said beside you in church come on church I'm telling you this tonight amen Amen Let me let me preach it both ways so you know where I'm at if you're jumping up saying amen just cause somebody else is doing it I ain't right amen but if you're sitting down cause you're worried about what somebody might think I ain't right either I'll tell you what you need to be be who you are amen and worship God even the way he leads you amen give it everything you got [Applause] Hallelujah are you with me tonight don't brother I don't care what they think I was just thinking about this and y'all gonna have to give me a little bit of Liberty right here amen because I feel like preaching in this area and because I got to think about if there's a bunch out here in the world and they're so overtaken amen by a perverted devil until Brother Ray they don't care what they see they don't care what they feel they don't care what they see in the mirror they don't care what people tell them and they don't care to be odd they don't care to look funny they don't care to stand out they don't care what you say about them come on friends I'm not trying to even make this a beautiful picture for you and say they're doing a good thing they're they're controlled by a perverted devil and that perverted devil has such a power over them amen until they don't care what nobody else thinks they'll ignore their own feelings they'll ignore amen what they see and everything else and identify themselves as something completely different from what they are and I got the thing about that and I thought my goodness if a perverted devil could so take over a mine until they could get such a control over a person until they don't care amen what somebody says about them how they look how crazy they seem how hot they may be and they'll even deny what they see in their own mirror I say I'll tell you this tonight amen I don't care what the world thinks and I don't care how I feel Hallelujah I don't care how I feel I don't care what I see I identify myself as a Holy Ghost Field in time message believer [Applause] amen can identify themselves as another gender and identify themselves as an animal or whatever more let them do what they want to do even behind identify myself with the message of my thoughtful I I did it by myself as a son of God Hallelujah you say but brother I don't feel like it or even what's that got to do with it deny your feelings Hallelujah look past the humanity and see the deity Hallelujah the man said this is a direct statement the mind of Christ is to be in the church souls in prison now he says the first nature is gone we not we we now and now we are the nature of him he lives in us we don't do our own will we do his will we don't think our own thoughts the mind is what thinks the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer Hallelujah he said there's a soul that's what we're speaking of that's the part I'm thinking of now amen that's within us watch this in the word became flesh so powerful here every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in a seed form that if revealed into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible will bring to pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be the Bible said let this man that will be in you that was in Christ Jesus amen as a man thinking in his heart so is he now your thoughts see if they become expression like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so then in God and creation created the world by his thoughts first then spoke and the thought expressed became material do you see what I mean now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light amen could say let there be no cancer it'll be gone let blind eyes be open it'll be so he said that was Jesus wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain be moved and pluck up and cast and sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said what kind of past then whatever things you said amen you'll have is that right what power has been given to the church [Applause] now you can express about mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation even then you see it before it happened it's expressed in word form and the word takes a hold and becomes material if your heart and mind is so in filled with God's spirit until your thoughts here's the key right here friends until your thoughts become his thoughts amen then there you are when you're mine you're leading your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit moving your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has so embodied empowered you amen you don't even use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the holy spirit is so built you until your thoughts and being is God's spirit expressing itself they're you what kind of people would we be oh he says it Branham Tabernacle is so filled with the presence of God why you didn't even use your own mind you didn't use your own thoughts didn't have no alternative of your own let's just led by the spirit and I love this part of right here I know you Brothers have used it many times when the human element goes out the spirit of God fills that vacancy when you empty yourself amen then amen will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving then your thoughts will become words and words will become material I believe it's on the road when the church will be so wrapped in Christ amen the Holy Spirit mankind will be away from themselves that they don't see themselves amen they don't have no thoughts but to serve God that great wonderful church will go forth in power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit listen church I'm going to tell you deity is not in heaven the prophet of God said deity is on the Earth in you and watching the quote that he says it he says I'm talking about the one that stood on the great invisible platform and spoke the word and there was nothing there Hallelujah amen he spoke the word and there was nothing luciferous in other words what I'm trying to tell you amen God didn't take something and make all this amen amen there was nothing and he spoke the word and out of nothing come creation oh I feel like preaching right now even because sometimes you're sitting there and he said I don't feel nothing praise God I don't see nothing praise God hallelujah amen because when there was nothing everything you see the world God created come out of nothing Hallelujah Abraham the word is here tonight whether you see it whether you feel it that has nothing to do with it the word of God created the world out of nothing and then the prophet of God said and not God is now in you the same fire the same cross Amen Let the fundamentals and then people deny the power of God say is wrong but the same power that spread the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women amen at this time amen yet you found out amen the devil is trying to hide you back I'll tell you there it is right there the devil is trying to hide you back the devil is doing everything he can to keep you from realizing Who You Are amen I'll tell you why because he knows if you find out who you are he's defeated come on Church the devil knows if you find out who you are he's defeated it takes some church amen it wasn't amen Daniel didn't get a chill bump amen I had a good feeling and walked into a lion's den Daniel had a revelation I'm a Seed of Abraham [Applause] Hallelujah it was a revelation of the word of God that was that was penetrating in Daniel's heart and Daniel said as a Seed of Abraham I know that God promised Abraham now his seed would possess the gates of every enemy he didn't walk in that lines in with a good feeling he walked in there with a revelation of the word of God come on Church him through your children and then walk in that fire amen they didn't get worked up with a music and just get a little sensation get to feeling real good say oh yeah we can take it we got the victory we got the victory we got the victory hey you know let's Ball come on Church they had a revelation and that they were children of Abraham they knew who they were [Applause] that's the Revelation amen that struck shame guard's heart and killed 600 Philistines come on church he didn't get some good love him in just a good little feeling and amen to that last amen for 30 minutes and amen as soon as you get outside you lost it all and I ain't trying to preach against all that kind of I think let me make something clear tonight I love to feel God is there anybody else in here love to I'm going to say this if you don't you ain't never failed him because if you're ever feeling one time you love amen to feel good I love to feel the presence of God I love you feel the anointing I love even when God comes down I love to worship him I love this child I love to dance come on church amen I love amen when I feel the Lord but I'll tell you this I'm glad I got a revelation that even when I don't Hallelujah I still know that he's gone he's gone it ain't my feeling that's carrying me these years it's a revelation that's sacred in my soul [Applause] Hallelujah it's in you it's in you being in a form of God who being in the form of God what's brother been taking he says see he humbled himself took on the form a certain brother Brown breaks into it said God and morphacy His God he takes and goes into that that Greek word and begin to break it down God changing his form what is he doing and that word in the Greek means the form by which a person or thing strikes the vision Mark 16 when Jesus was welcome with the two on the road to Emmaus he said the Bible says he appeared unto them in another form brother Brown comes along in the unveiling of God oh unveiling of God church I'm telling you you're living in the age not of the veiling but the unveiling of God and a prophets pulling a veil back off of God and he says look it's God in more faith he's changing his mask he's changing his form and he breaks into Philippians 2 and he says see he emptied himself but brother grandma gives a thought show us amen he emptied himself he's another way we think not amen but he but he he changed his form can I can I tell it to you in a way maybe help you understand because sometimes you get in your mind all that was in God he poured into Christ right this is truth all that was in Christ listen now all all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the church but but but sometimes we get in our mind like we take three glasses and sit up here and we take and we got one full and two empty we think this one's God right the full one and we pour it all into the second one now Christ is full and God's empty president said that you understand brother that's what brother Brown said not the way you not the way we think [Music] but he emptied himself I'm on church amen God in Christ didn't leave God empty and let me say this and he was no less God in Jesus Christ that he wasn't a pillar of Fire how many can say Amen to that he took on flesh he become a man but God was no less God in the man Christ Jesus than he was as an eternal God in heaven [Applause] you with me so far I hope you can take the next part of it and he's no less God in you Hallelujah I said he's no less God in you that he was in Christ Hallelujah he said well wait a minute the fullness of God is not in me you're right on that point amen we don't have the quantity but we got the same quantity or our quality rather amen we got the same life so now I'm going to ask you this question how much of the Holy Ghost how much of Zoe life how much of eternal life does it take to be an overcomer how much of the life of God does it take to defeat the enemy how much I'll tell you this where the Prophet said it if you got a spoonful of the ocean everything that's in that ocean Hallelujah everything that's another is in that spoon come on church and I want to tell you amen Christ in you it's no less you are not taken away from him and him being in you don't leave him empty [Music] I wish I had time to preach amen because I'm telling you this in our church amen God in Christ didn't leave God empty and Christ in you did leave Christ empty the Holy Ghost can be in this building in this service in your heart and you still have a high priest at the right hand of God make an intercession on your behalf I know the devil even don't like you to understand that because he's trying to say oh if Christ is here he can't be there or if God is here he can't be there well I just want to tell the devil so we ain't talking about a man and we ain't talking about a God we made we're talking about the Eternal Supreme and him self-existing light he can be here all places at all times and do anything now he wants to do anytime he wants to do it [Applause] God changing his form changing his mask emptying himself see the prophecy the perfect image of the god man God and morphe Hallelujah he changed from the supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death it was God's perfect Masterpiece then in who's been at this Melchizedek he said God and morphe mask in the pillar of fire god and more faith in a man called Jesus God and morphe in his church God With Us where he says God above us Pillar of Fire God With Us Jesus Christ God in us hallelujah amen what is it they're condescending God up there holy amen no one could touch him he set up on the mount even if an animal touched him out had to die and then God came down and changed his tent and come down and live with us become one of us and we held him he was that well the Bible says amen that was God above us God With Us Now is God in us the Holy Spirit not a third person the same person God came down and become flesh and died to death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get in it Hallelujah listen friends amen the home mystery the Revelation the whole mystery is that Christ in you the hope of glory it's all right he become a man in Jesus Christ to do what Amen to do the work of a kinsman redeemer amen not just so he could live in that man only come on Friends he wanted to get in you he wanted to get in me amen he wanted to live in his church amen he wanted to come amen not just be with us amen he even taught his disciples one day he said it's expedient for you that I go because if I don't go the comforter cannot come hallelujah amen and what was he telling him he was saying it's been good to be with you I've loved being with you amen but I'm not satisfied just being with you I want to get in here because there were certain scriptures that could not be fulfilled under the revelation of Emmanuel God With Us listen friends are you are you following what I'm saying there was a certain part of the word that could only be fulfilled when he got in you is in morphe president said changing his form that word actually means the form or the outward expression that embodies the essential inner substance that the form is uh so that the form another watch this I'm going to try to read it the right way the form or outward expression that embodies the essential inner substance so that the form is in complete Harmony with the Inner Essence amen the form or outward expression that embodies the essential inner substance so that the form is in complete harmony with the Inner Essence and then a prophet under the Holy Spirit picks up his pen and gives a ride and the Holy Spirit begins to say notice the harmony between the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father Saint John 5 19. this harmony now is to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death first the sea be planted and be watered it will rise up again here is the secret the word is in the bride Hallelujah as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ where she knows what he wants done with the word Hallelujah even she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord you believe it those in the bride were holy they're his will no one can make them do otherwise oh you ought to shout on that a little while no one even if you're a part of that bride you had the bra the mind of Christ amen you have thus said the Lord even no one can make you do otherwise hallelujah amen they have to say the Lord that keeps steal they know it has to be God in them doing the work fulfilling his own word amen he did not complete all his work the work that he had to do while he was here in his Earthly Ministry was so the prophet of God what did he say he is working now in and through the bride Hallelujah he is now working in and through the bride Christ in you is that right it's Christ in you listen you got a higher thought you've come to a higher thought you come to you've come to listen amen you see amen as a world has come to a climax it's building up in this great age of information great age of knowledge great age of scientific achievement but watch what brother Brown shows and the message countdown he said it always runs in a parallel is that right amen and he says for every achievement amen forever see what man is doing on this side God has an achievement over here with the church are you are you following me hey man and I'm just gonna close I'm closing so don't get nervous amen but the prophet of God showing you this amen he's showing you in the how that amen he said what brought us to this place he said man amen that would not take no for an answer amen they moved out into the Realms of the unknown they broke into amen into and because amen they caught a vision of something and they knew it was possible and one man would follow another man's work and he would build on that and he would move it to a higher level amen is that are you following what is and brother Brown's bringing it through and listen I'm just going to say this and I amen look how long the world went look how at me years of time of the Dark Ages with very very little achievements very little changes in the scientific Realms or any any you know there was so little that was accomplished but then all of a sudden it began to change and it began to move out of the eight the Dark Ages into what they call the age of Discovery amen and come on down amen and Men begin to rise up amen great scientists amen and Men amen they begin to say things like the world Amen the the the the the universe and our system is uh you know it's it don't really everything ain't worth rotating around the earth amen is going around the Sun and you know what they call them Heretics they that there was all kind of opposition there's all kind of people standing there telling amen quit saying that stuff ain't gonna quit pre you know quit preaching that nonsense hey man quit quit writing them kind of uh books and amen all these kind of things quit talking about that amen listen that goes against our theology that goes against our thinking listen for instance men like Galileo hey man we're gonna make these bold statements amen we're tried as Heretics by the Catholic Church and at the same time that thing that that's going on Luther Rises up and at the same time they invent a printing press you think that's all by an accident no brother Brown comes the opening of the seals tells us there was an anointing released amen it was a it was a it was a very wisdom of man because that anointing of a man the very and it was released upon the Earth and they began to build amen and they begin to make great achievements amen and then they moved from a horse and buggy to an automobile and that one the end of it ain't been moving up into Wesley's age now because every natural achievement has a spiritual achievement all right is that right amen and then amen from that amen they begin to let people begin to say it's possible for a man to fly there was all kind of people said it'll never happen in a thousand years it won't happen there was preachers preaching from their poopists even men will never fly that is something reserved for the angels of them I'm not making that up that's actually what they were saying but but I heard brother Wayne told me something that Isaac found he found a statement that one of the Wright Brothers come up with and he wrote this letter is trying to get some support or something I believe it was and and he said I'm afflicted and my Affliction is getting worse and I fear there's no cure for the Affliction that I have and he begins to make this statement I'm paraphrasing somewhat but he said I'm Afflicted with the belief that it's possible for man to fly and he said I have fear that amen my Affliction if is going to continue to grow worse until it takes over amen all uh I'm gonna lose everything I got my finances everything amen's gonna amen be lost to this affliction brother man said they refused to take no for an answer and you know what they did amen they saw the possibilities because they began to study what somebody else said but I'm going to tell you something they didn't sit around their house Brother Ray and write essays and and they you know they study what somebody else's and they just said man this is so good and come up with formulas and put things together no amen they didn't sit on their couch and and put things together and think man that's beautiful amen I believe it might be possible one day somebody's gonna pick this up amen no amen they took the things they studied amen and they started putting things together and they started building things and they went out there and they started trying it come on friends and you know what amen they had a lot of failures and there was a lot of obstacles and there's a lot of people saying it'll never happen amen but it didn't stop them Hallelujah and we moved into an airplane age amen and at the same time that the Wright brothers is having a successful flag even the Holy Ghost it's fallen on Azusa Street in 1906 and we're moving into an airplane age but that ain't the end of the story because we didn't stay there no we moved there to an astronaut age Hallelujah but forever natural achievement there's a spiritual achievement [Applause] and and the scientific Minds kept getting greater and greater until we had an Einstein is that right no the greatest scientific mind of all times and and he come up with even you know his his uh equations and formula they're still being in use right now today breakthrough at the same time that there was a an Einstein there was another spiritual achievement y'all were gonna call me crazy it's all right because I lost my mind you said I done told you but this assures there was a natural Einstein there was a spiritual Einstein that God a spiritual scientists Hallelujah and he began to break into what what was would have been uh it would have been impossible in Luther's age it was impossible in Wesley's age it was impossible in Pentecost hallelujah amen but now amen has moved up into the very intelligence of Christ fancy you see what I'm saying amen the world is out of Pinnacle of a scientific age amen this is the age of Science and of intellect and and great uh understandings but for every natural achievement there's a spiritual achievement [Music] and you know what they're saying right now right now they're saying that immortality is in the Realms of possibility right now they're saying that any any person born after I believe if I'm not mistaken around the in the years of maybe 1970 or somewhere around in there see could live could be immortal one man wrote and he's a very renowned uh scientists that is well known for making predictions that come to pass and he said he said it this way he said it would be in the Realms of possibility in the next seven years for man to reach immortality but you know what they also have found this they said these bodies that we live in that they have an absolute um you know they're they're never lived forever we can't live forever in these bodies he said with all medical science and all the achievements and all the everything that they could do for you in this body they said even you know maybe over time we could stretch it out 150 years Man live 150 years old but eventually this body is going to give out it's going to die it's going to frame so even they begin to realize they're looking for immortality but they know you can't do it in the body you're in now so they've went to artificial intelligence and they say now immortality is in the Realms of possibility in the next seven years by artificial intelligence in other words by another intelligence there's going to be a a a the real the the possibility of immortality is going to come Hallelujah amen and then I got to think about this and you know running in the parallel of what brother Brown taught us in the message countdown for every natural achievement there's a spiritual achievement and when man gets this high God is real raising a church up higher Hallelujah listen we are not a laodicean church we are not in the Pentecostal age we're in an astronaut age hallelujah we're not an airplane up and down and up and down and up and down you're in a space shuttle Hallelujah a greater power a greater amen amen do you understand what I'm preaching to you amen and now a prophet is sitting there telling you for every natural achievement it was a spiritual achievement and I'm just telling you amen that they are saying within the next seven years man could be immortal I say brother if they're that close in the scientific Realms how close are we tonight amen and those reels are the Supernatural and it won't be artificial intelligence it'll be the mind of Christ Hallelujah the very intelligence of God coming down to the church it's gonna change and Mortal bodies Hallelujah and that's mortal will put on immortality and this corruption will but on incorruption Hallelujah and there's some of you amen I believe I'm saying amen I'm going to say it because I believe it with everything within me there's people in this building right now that will never taste death hallelujah amen there is people sitting right here amen that will never die amen but will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye cause Paul said we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed hallelujah amen and the mind is here to achieve it do you believe it let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus it'll stay near our feet tonight at the musicians would come sought it not robbery to be equal with God listen to me listen you're not taking something that don't belong to you this is
