Lord tonight and amen to feel his presence and his anointing isn't he good to us Amen in Ephesians chapter 4 tonight amen we're going to be reading the scriptures Ephesians chapter 4 for there is one body in the fourth verse there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto everyone of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherein he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth and he that descended is the same also that ascended up above far above all Heavens that he might feel all things that's a very important part of this scripture that he might feel all things amen let's just bow our hearts for a word of prayer almighty God we thank you tonight we thank you for the children of God that have come into this room Lord that have come within the gates tonight to worship you I pray father that you would bless them that you would strengthen them Lord father to the visitors that are among us I pray oh God that your mercy would be to them may a welcoming Spirit God move upon each of their hearts may clear speech and understanding strike hearts Lord and we're asking you tonight for just a special anointing to put the scriptures together Lord in a way Lord that understanding could bring strength and anointing Lord now we're committing this service into your hands and asking you for your grace in Jesus name we pray amen and amen and God bless you as you can have your seats tonight and again I'm going to speak here on this Ephesian series and I'm going to speak here on this a section of scriptures and I want to if I would call it something tonight for a context I want to talk to you about the work of his Ascension the work of his Ascension uh as I speak to you tonight about this I think that it's a powerful thing uh as we were speaking to you on Sunday about keeping the unity I kind of like that I like the Lord gave us Unity and we just want to keep it so I don't believe we have to establish it he established it by his spirit amen but we just want to keep that and that's why Paul says here that there is one body and there is one Spirit even as you are called in the hope of your calling now there is one Lord there is one faith and there is one baptism now that's pretty that's pretty powerful tonight because there's just one Lord amen isn't that amazing that that one Lord and and many people would saywell then who would that be because of course it's Peter in the book of Acts in the second chapter that announces and he said this same Jesus that you've crucified God hath made him both Lord and Christ amen then I believe that Jesus is the Lord Of Glory I believe that he is the Lord of lords amen and it's written upon his vesture and his great return on his wi horse it said he is the king of kings amen so I believe that our lord Jesus is that one Lord Lord amen God is just one and he's manifested through many offices but he is just one there is one lord and there is one Faith now here's the thing that we're living in a world today that most of the time you meet somebody at the grocery store you meet them somewhere and they'll say to you uh are you a Christian you say yeah next question is what faith are you well actually there's only one Faith amen I know people want to separate our faith into Baptist or Lutheran or some other Doctrine but there is just one faith amen and that Faith according to the book of Jude is the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ it's when Jude would say that we should contend for the faith he doesn't say a faith he said we should contend for a the faith and that faith is the faith of Jesus Christ amen so there isn't just a faith there is the faith you reading scripture in the book of Timothy it said they're ever learning coming to the knowledge uh uh never coming to the knowledge of Truth amen reprobates concerning the faith so it is a the faith but you can't have the faith without one Lord there just has to be one Lord and then you can have one Faith see if you got many different Masters if there's many different ideas amen then there's going to be a lot of different faiths amen but if you can just bring it down to the preeminence of the word now this is real powerful later on because if you can bring it to the preeminence of the word you'll just have one faith in other words if you can get uh uh everybody's mind under one word amen one Lord one one one place of lordship then there would just be one Faith amen and that Faith amen would be the faith of Jesus Christ you go back in the in into the scriptures and find out if it wasn't the moment that Eve brought in another Lord is when she lost her faith that's when Faith was broken was when she took reasoning on the word and she lost the lordship of God and when that lordship was lost then the whole earth was plunged because there become more than one Lord so if you want to restore One Faith you had to restore one Lord and that Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ is that right amen the one Lord one faith and there is just one baptism is that right the prophet said some people's going to try to tell you that that is a water baptism I got many Church of Christ friends and we've had long discussions over this amen but they believe that when you get baptized in the water that's your salvation but listen friends water does not save you not water only even Jesus said not water only but by the water the blood and the spirit that's why Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12 that there is only one Spirit by one Spirit we are baptized into one body so brother man say Paul is not speaking of water baptism he's speaking of spiritual baptism so in other words if there's one Lord there's one faith and there's one baptism then it would be just one body and every person in the body would be in a member of that body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I tell you wouldn't it be something tonight if the Holy Ghost could fall into every Church in America and every Church in life and it would baptize them into that one body and then they would be given the measure of Jesus Christ now you all know tonight that as Christians that we carry a portion of deity inside us but the prophet said notice as Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily he said the whole ocean was in Jesus but to you and I it was like a teaspoon devotion has been placed into every one of us now it's the same kind of water it has the same qualities it has the same makeup but it's not the same measure as it was in Jesus Christ but as Sons and Daughters of God we've been given a measure of the gift of Christ which is the Holy Ghost and us having that measure of Christ amen he has given us that this this evening and thank God for it because he's given it to us for a reason I believe according to the scriptures that God has given us of his spirit amen to as we say in the scriptures the next verses it's amazing because the way that Paul builds this is he's taking us into the idea that one Spirit One Faith one baptism being in Christ with a measure of Christ and then in Ephesians 4:8 he begins by saying wherefore he saith when he ascended upon high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men wherefore he saith amen when he ascended upon high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now here's the beauty of this is when he saith now this is actually amen Paul quoting Old Testament scripture Psalm 68 and verse 18 amen the scripture is telling us that when Peter excuse me when David wrote this in the Book of Psalms he said thou has ascended upon high and thou has led captivity captive that thou receive is for men yay for the rebellious also the Lord God might dwell among them isn't that powerful talk about you Gentiles again amen even got gifts for you rebellious also amen for you that wasn't the Commonwealth of Israel he so conquered that he gave a gift of the measure of Christ even to the rebellious he brought you into the manifold wisdoms of God by his spirit and made you a part of his body the scripture said he ascended on high and led captivity captive now this is the Book of Psalms definitely David is speaking of God that God did this but now Paul is definitely saying Jesus did this so he's taking the Old Testament prophecy that God had led captivity captive and show that Jesus did this himself to fulfill the scripture according to what was written of him for it saith of him amen it's in psalm 16 that Jesus himself again amen speaking of his death burial and Resurrection when Jesus was to be buried in Psalm 16:9 David is speaking of someone he said therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth for my flesh shall also Rest In Hope for thou will not suffer th th will not leave my soul in Hell neither will th suffer thine Holy One to see corruption now David is talking about the Holy One and Jesus applies this scripture to himself in Matthew chap 12 when Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees and they begin to ask him for a sign he said he he answered and said unto them in the evil an adulterous generation Matthew 12:39 after a sign and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas with three days and three nights in the Well's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so Jesus is taking psalm 16 and making it mean that he will go into the Earth for a period of days amen that will be for sure less than 72 hours because corruption sets in a body after 72 hours and he's saying corruption will never enter the Holy One Of God now why is he calling him a holy one because he's not just another Homo Sapien he's not just another human being he's not just another man born of any woman but this is the Holy One Of God this is in Isaiah 9 it was it was the son shall be born and the government shall be given to him and of his Dominion there will be no end this is who it's speaking of in Isaiah 7 when he said a virgin shall conceive and it says and God would be with us isn't it amazing that Psalms is speaking of the Holy One of Israel and Jesus is telling them that I'm going to go into the Earth but I'm not going to stay I'm going to come back again as a sign under this generation it will be a sign of the Resurrection I think it's amazing to see that our Lord using scripture to make sure you understood that he was the one that was being spoken of now the reason we we must identify these things is because Jesus laid in the Tomb for three days now here's the thing he laid from Friday to Sunday in the Tomb and the prophet of God said see he was barred from the resurrection until everything was fulfilled he was barred from raising from the dead until all was fulfilled see it was spoke of him he wouldn't stay too long but it was also spoke that he was going to go amen he led captivity captive in other words you're going he's going to go but he ain't going to stay long because there is a work that he must do in the regions of the lost that was a work that he must do before he ascended he had to descend to the lower parts of the earth listen what he says I will not leave his soul in hell he was going but not staying isn't that amazing he was going but he wasn't staying now there was a reason that he was going is because there had to be a work done for the Church of the Living God see what we find out is according to Hebrews chapter 2 this Bible speaks to us and it tells us that Jesus was descending from God into man and into the lower parts of the earth it says before he ascended he descended yes sir amen before he ascended he desc ended amen now it's pretty amazing if you if you look at it in this manner amen because if you're a Bible reader you know over in the Book of Genesis it's when Jacob amen is traveling he lays down and he puts his head on a stone and he has a dream that night and he dreams about a ladder that reaches into the heaven and upon the earth and the Bible said he saw angels ascending and descending upon that ladder but now what we're going to be viewing tonight is this not going to be Angels up and down that ladder we're going to see God and man on that ladder see because God who was in heaven had lost the attribute of his sons and they had fell out of the Heavenly atmosphere and Jesus said I got to go after them God has said I got to go into the Earth to get them and watch what he does he brings Jacob's Ladder and comes right down into the Earth brother BR said notice in the first place it was Angels but in the second place here we're going to see God and man using that ladder to come out of the heavens you know Jesus amen actually come from the heavens into the Earth you you it's amazing when the Bible speaks it says unto the Angels he have not put in subjection the world to come he said in a certain place he testified Hebrews 2 and6 saying what is a man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou would visitest him now thou mest a lower than the angels and th crownest him with a glory and honor and did set him him over the work of thine hands now watch this Jesus is going to be as descending before he ascends he's descending and the scripture says he's going to come lower than the Angels Hebrews 2:7 he will be lower than the angels and thou put amen all things in subjection under his feet and under him have left nothing that's not put under him but now we see not all things yet put under him but we see Jesus who was made lower than the angels for the suffering of death now there's the answer he was made lower than the angels for the suffering of death he had to die in the human body he was crowned with Glory and Honor that he might by grace of God should taste the death of every man now I think it's amazing that he became at the next verse he became the captain of our Salvation amen isn't it something that we have a captain of Salvation brother man said he said I was down there he said I seen the the Indianapolis or excuse me the uh the city he was from Jeffersonville there he said I seen him come to a house fire one day and he said I seen the captain of the fire truck he said he jumped out of the truck and the fire chief you know he said he run over and looked at the fire and he told everybody said hey squirt a little water here and squirt a little water here and squirt a little water here he said they wasn't getting no fires put out at all he said and all a sudden here come Louisville he said he said all of a sudden they run up there in the Chief jumped out and threw a ladder up and run up the ladder and broke something grabbed and started putting the fires out he said see there was a captain on the scene amen and the captain of our Salvation was the leader of our Salvation he didn't just show up and said do a little here a little there amen but he was the captain of the movement of Salvation in that he came from the heavens of Heavens down Jacob's Ladder and descended into the Earth and bypass the angels to come to Mortal men that he might walk in the darkness of the ages that he might stay in the human body of Deery and de humiliation amen it was the degradation of almighty God to come into a human body who could who could be tempted according to scripture if you read on he came past the angels and he took on him the form amen of the Seed of Abraham amen now that's something isn't it and he became our brother that he might be tempted in every manner like we are now you might think that now I remember years ago I I come up I come up with a a great uncle he came out of the Pentecostal movement into the message but there was one little area he always had a little trouble on he he he always kind of felt like Jesus wouldn't have roted in the grave you know he always felt like Jesus couldn't have had a had a had a body that he could have had a wife and a family amen because of the one that's teaching but here the prophet teaches us amen that Jesus's body was altogether a human body he said he was 100% man and 100% God many people try to say well was he God or was he man the beauty is he was both it was the Paradox of a union between God and man and God himself in his fullness came into a human body and come down Jacob's Ladder as a germ in a woman's womb and he might come after falling man that had fail through a woman he would redeem through a woman because he was almighty God and in him was the attribute of Redeemer yes he bypassed angels and he came in into a human body that he might suffer after death now in John chapter 8 and verse 42 I hope you can stay with me tonight please please forgive me for so much uh building here and John 8:42 he said Heen if he said Jesus said to them if God was your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me he proceeded forth from God and John 16 and 27 for the father himself loveth you because he loved me and hath believed that I came from God isn't that powerful I came forth from the father and am come into the world and I leave the world and go to the Father John 16:29 his disciples said unto him Lo now thou speakest plainly speak not in a proverb now we are sure that knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee We Believe thou camest forth from God isn't that powerful amen the disciples believed it Jesus spoke it Paul believed it I believe it tonight Paul wrote it in a better in 1 Corinthians 15-45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and after that which is spiritual the first men is of the earth Earthly the second man is the Lord From Heaven I tell you he's the Lord Of Glory tonight he issued out of the bosom of the father and he turned around and said I come from God and I'm going back to God I tell you he came for a purpose and it was to redeem Fallen man he had a work to come from God Amen when I look at this tonight I think it's powerful Amen in John 3 and: 12 he said I told you Earthly things and you believe them not how how shall you believe if I tell you Heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven well Glory you're talking about an omnipresent God he was standing there talking to Nicodemus sitting on the housetop and he was in heaven at the same time I'm talking about a God Amen that could be standing in a human body and still be in the heavens at the same time I'm talking about God tonight friends you can't box him up in our mentalities or our theologies he is almighty God and he visited the Earth for the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself I I want you to know tonight Ain nobody can help you but Jesus there ain't a denomination there ain't a church there ain't a human being amen Jesus the son of God proceeded out of God and came into this Earth amen that he might be the merci ful high priest unto every man that reaches out to him I'll tell you he descended into this Earth but he brought heaven with him wo Glory you might think I'm crazy but I'm so glad to know tonight that Jesus didn't have to leave heaven in heaven but he was so much God that he come out of the heavens and brought heaven with him my goodness you know he did it you know he brought heaven with him the very night he was born Angels appeared on the earth and said good will and peace unto man amen Heaven and Earth was coming together Jehovah was being born in a manger the Creator the Bible said he created the world and they didn't even know he was in the world that's right see it was God yes sir that was coming into that look at what he did he descended into the earth now look what happened as he came into the Earth the atmosphere of Heaven came with him see he was he was coming into the Earth to bring Heaven into the Earth do you see he was only the only one of the gods that didn't have sin all of you Sons were created Gods amen right but he was the only one without sin so he was called the first of the head of this new race of a Goden being or God Church that's right in the Messianic Kingdom so when he came into the Earth he brought heaven with him isn't it powerful when he got on the sea that night and he's going to go over there amen and he's going to deliver a man who's over there in the tombs now that man was crying over in them tombs and you know he was crying desperately for help because there wasn't nobody in that area could help him there wasn't nothing that could that could that could help him at all but when Jesus came now listen he was on the boat the whole time and even the demons got upset and said we'll prevent his coming but they couldn't prevent the coming of the Lord and when he got to the other side and he stepped out into public view amen that devil could not resist that man from coming to the Lord Of Glory the prophet of God said that little that little that little little humble man Jesus the Bible said he was a small man told us he wasn't nothing to look at brother man said he wasn't nothing to look at said just probably just a skinny fella small guy he said wasn't nothing to look at at all he said but whenever that fell in those tombs thought he was big and you know he was able to conquer Jesus he said he come running out after him and he was going to destroy him till he looked into the eyes of the of the Messiah and brother Ram said those famous words I remember years ago I was preaching a meeting it hit me like it never had I ain't forgot it yet but it was a beautiful statement brother bam looked he says that the the that the G Maniac of gardea looked into the eyes of Jesus and he said what are you doing in there he realized the one that had threw him out of the h Heavens come on now Satan didn't fall he was cast out of the heavens Michael threw him out is that right and now he was on the earth and he had taken over this man and he seen in the eyes of this little human being the same one that had challenged him in the heavens had chased him into the Earth and Satan thought I got this one where I want him I got a captive the way I want him but Jesus went to where the captive was but when he got there heaven was with him he took heaven to the graveyard he took heaven to Garda and he let the maniac see what it would have been like in heaven glory to God when Jesus is here Heaven is on the earth hey Earth is just a place Heaven is an atmosphere and when Jesus stood there and looked at them and the demons left that man didn't he sir sir y'all remember the story amen it's pretty power cuz that fell went back and testified and I've always thought it was amazing the people that heard the testimony said won't you go with him we don't even want you in this country make Jesus leave our our our Coast make him leave the coast brother said why they want him to leave he said because he cost him too much when he came by there was too many hogs died in that Revival come on there's too many too many hogs and they were hog Farmers what was Hogs doing there in Israel anyhow amen they ain't supposed to have that amen but you see what happened it cost them too much and sometimes people really don't want Jesus to come by what they really want is a church doctrine or some little Creed every kind of devil can hide under theology but you let the baptism of the Holy Ghost get a hold of a Son of God and he begin to preach the message of the hour it'll uncover every devil it'll stomp down every Hallelujah it'll liberate the [Applause] church am yes sir amen it it was costly amen but the man had life after that and his family had a daddy and do you see what it was it was the atmosphere of Jesus it was the same thing when he stood there with a Roman Centurion you remember the Roman Centurion a gentile like you understood the authority of atmosphere and word and and and he said I got a sick baby at the house and Jesus said I'll come and heal him it was a beautiful thing he said he said look you don't need to come to my house I'm not worthy but if you'll just speak the word wo there it was there's that Gentile Faith he knew he didn't have to lay hands on me he knew that the word had an atmosphere that when it was spoken there was an authority in that word that Roman knew that and when Jesus spoke let me let me just say it clearly that Gentile knew that the word spoke by Jesus was as powerful as his physical presence glory to God that word into that atmosphere was powerful amen and that child was healed in the 11th hour now what was going on was Jesus was exercising and showing Heavenly Authority on Earth in a human being now this is beautiful because if you could see that it was from that atmosphere he ruled and it's where death Spirits were healed it was where blind eyes were opened in the atmosphere is how that the lane got up and walked it was the atmosphere that he brought that brought healing and it could deliver the harlots and it could deliver the the self-righteous and it could let the Pharisee laws amen be lifted off of people that they could have Liberty do you see what it was it was the atmospheres that he was under and that's what had been blocked off from mankind yeah now I'll say this to you today most people maybe don't understand I know you do here at the church but all over this Earth brother B since the day of the Garden Eden that sin was committed Heavens was shut off from mankind Heavens atmospheres amen was shut off from mankind Satan is the prince of the power of the air so brother B is telling us that man and Satan switch places that Satan robbed from man the author prority over the atmosphere and he took it himself and became the prince of the power of air why are thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer see no man could see into Glory no man could understand because the power is just above it Heaven means atmosphere above and all these Powers have been shut off from mankind because of sin do you see it was the atmosphere that was cut off do you know that's what really matters in your life is the atmosphere you know that what matters in a church is the atmosphere listen Adam was standing at the Garden of Eden but had lost the atmosphere do you see that he wasn't a different man but sin had took the atmosphere you can come to a church all day long but if there's no atmosphere it's just a church amen you can have a home but if there's no atmosphere it's just a house amen but when you get the atmosphere of the holy ghost in a church in a home in A Life That's where things matter is the kind of atmosphere and the atmosphere was cut off brother bam said atmosphere is what matters now you can see this it's atmosphere that matters now I'll just show it to you very quickly it was atmosphere when brother Ram was standing there and those Hornets come raging out of that bees nest Prophet was just mowing his yard folks he was out in the backyard brother Chaz didn't he have a shirt on look like a preacher I'm sure amen he's out there sweating and wiping his brow mowing his own yard amen probably just out there enjoying the the moment and he hits a branch and bunch of hornets come out of it brother BR said here they come now you know why they did that that was a fallen atmosphere had that happened up there in Eden there wouldn't have been no trouble but since the atmosphere not even man had fallen the whole earth has fallen so those Hornets took out after God God's son and look what he did Brother Ram said in a moment it come right out you divine love brother R's been preaching on it but look what happens right out of that atmosphere come those words he apologized them crazy bees now I tell you what and you talking about some humility now I you know I know you got to be careful here but you know what it mean amen sometimes you're looking for somebody to apologize to you to get thing over but it might be that God has so arranged it that he's not going to allow that to make you humble yourself to be able to take a wrong to make somebody right wow preacher I could never do that isn't that amazing Jesus was the only right one that ever lived and become wrong so all of you could be right he was right folks and he took the argument and became wrong that you might have Liberty brother Brandon wouldn't have never worked out a deal with MBS hey look if you'll apologize to me then I'll apologize to you and we'll go back to no sir he just looked at that beast and said I'm sorry I've trespassed you go back and I won't harm you and those things turned around and went flew can you well wouldn't that have been something to watch seen them Beast flying right back in that Nest is't that amazing it was atmosphere doesn't that Brother Richard in the backyard in the middle of the summer in Indiana with a man with his shirt off and sweat running down didn't have a nice suit didn't have a nice cushion chair he didn't have atmosphere of a bunch of music and organ beautiful singing amen but he lived somewhere with God God that the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost was right there all the time Hallelujah my feel like preaching tonight to know that God walks with a man think about that bull brother man jumped there hey man we've been brother R's been on it for a while that bull he jumped over that bull and look what he done pulled for that gun first nature remember pulled for that gun he said then something kicked in that y'all know that bull would have never attacked him in Eden but because of the Fallen nature it was living in an atmosphere it was ready to destroy God's son but the prophet stood back you could preach while I remember can I just preach to you minute here I remember I was preaching one time Brother Andy I was over in India and I was preaching and there I had a brother travel with me because I need an interpreter and so we traveled about four or five churches and he heard me preach on Divine love and I had a little story I told on that bull and I got to talking about how sometimes s you run into people and like a better word to say it some people's bullheaded and I said you know when somebody's a little bullheaded and they're not going to make things right sometimes you have to be the brother brandom in the picture yes sir now don't call him a bull or it's going to get bad but I was telling that story as we was traveling I was preaching on love and I and and I was preaching at his church it was a couple Services later and I was preaching at his church we preaching right along and I got up on this bull story and I just touched it and went on and I kept on preaching in many kind of looked at me funny he said the story and I said what's that he said the bull the story you got to tell it so brother brother Carri we Circle back and picked up the Bull story there a pastor for you there's a pastor for you amen it's see but it's the atmosphere that's what matters is the atmosphere brother Brandon was saying to you see that's what happened the atmosphere hung over the Earth of darkness and Gloom and death and weary and prayers couldn't come up because the atonement wasn't made woo because the atonement wasn't made the atmosphere was blocked off from man that's what it was brother bandam attributes everything to Atmosphere you know what he said he said the attitude brings the results that's the reason Pentecost got to go to the upper room cuz they got in one place in one Accord it's the atmosphere what brings the results let every man or woman in this building boy and girl get everything out of their mind but the Lord Jesus and believe he's standing present night and you'll see something happen that'll cause headlines in the newspapers I believe that look at what he's saying it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and the Wonders and the powers of God Among the people it's the atmosphere when people get to a place they're reasoning wondering stewing and thinking and tore up and they you don't know where they're stand half of them is not scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right you can't do it it won't be right it's got to be in one cord one place settled down with one motive one thing you're going to see something happen then hallelujah you're going to see something happen because it turns into an atmosphere of faith it turns into an atmosphere of Bel and I got a lot of quotes I won't read them to you but I'll say this amen I believe that we can come into an atmosphere and if you ever ever been in that atmosphere one time you'll never be satisfied anywhere else you'll never be satisfied anywhere else if you ever been there one time you want to be there every time you want your heart to be sanctioned by the power of God I'll tell you this amen the holy spirit amen amen you see what it is it's the atmosphere now brother randam and maybe I'll deal with this later but the atmosphere brother bam deals with is Dimensions or the spirit amen and you know what atmosphere can get to the place where it becomes creative and atmosphere can get so powerful that it can become creative now brother B was out in the woods and created some squirrels that's right there you go atmospheres can become creative amen things that you don't have that you need right can come from the atmosphere of creation am you get under the all impulse of the spirit of God and let him go to speaking I'm I'm looking here brother B said a man or woman that ever walked in the shakan of Glory the whole world shut off behind them and no matter what the devil says you don't pay no attention they're living in a different atmosphere they're living in there where they put Aaron's Rod now that now I'm not just off on a limb when Moses built God a place in the desert he built the tent right yeah and brother Bram said it was three different atmospheres to eat the Mana one was on the outside one was in the inner court and one was in the holies of holies but that holies of holies in that atmosphere remember it the food never went bad in that atmosphere it was in Aaron's Rod it's where it budded it's where the word was it's where the Shak of Glory was but there was only one man allowed in that atmosphere that he might be able to sprinkle the blood on the day of atonement now there's a whole law set up on the day of atonement what he would do is the high priest would come into that atmosphere and he would sprinkle that now brother Brandon was saying that the New Birth has put that atmosphere in your life the same atmosphere that was in Aaron's rod and caused the bloom and that's where the Ark of the Lord was is the same atmosphere a Believer lives in today isn't that powerful it's called a Heavenly place in Christ Jesus amen amen now watch because this atmosphere was preserved by a priesthood yeah now that wouldn't remain there if there wasn't blood sprinkled every year so they would go in every year and they would sprinkle the blood and I think it was seven times they would do it uh uh you know there's a lot of different uh writings but if you look in Luke 16 the day of atom is very powerful but they would actually go in there Luke 16 and ex Leviticus 16 and they would it was started with an L I jumped over the others but but you see what it is when they would go in there the blood of the Lamb would preserve the atmosphere that Adam used to live in but because of the Fall there was no real blood to let man walk around on the earth in that atmosphere he could only experience it back there in that Veil but that blood was what kept that alive now here's the beauty of this because when Jesus comes to the Earth he has the same atmosphere in his life that's in that Tabernacle in the wilderness he is actually the Ark of the Lord he is the word of God on the earth amen my goodness in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us he was the fullness of the godhead bodily come on church all God dwelt in him he was the Throne of God he is the king of kings you see that heaven had came to the earth now I think it's powerful here because when Jesus dies do you see what he's happening is Jesus is descending now before he can Ascend he has to descend so this this song sang it living he loved me and and dying he saved me and buried he carried my sins far away it's a beautiful song sir Liv and he loved me in other words God's love brought him to the Earth but he had to Die to Save Me So the blood of the Lord Jesus on the cross brought the Salvation to man kind so we'd know that right but when they buried him he also fulfilled the law of the Two Goats of The Book of Leviticus y'all all heard of the escape goat you know when somebody does something and then they then they blame it on you you're called an escapegoat well brother Bram said of course a lot of the theologians believed that was the devil he said no it wasn't he said no because see if the devil was your escapegoat there was a law that when when the high priest would bring two goats and he would take one and he would he would Slaughter him and then take the blood of the of the first goat put on the second goat and confess all of the sins of the camp upon the goat and then he would run it off into the Wilderness but if that goat came back it brought its sins back with it brother Ram said there you go it's proof it wasn't the devil he said could the devil bring it back the devil wouldn't take it and keep it the devil would bring it back yeah but what Jesus did was he took it on himself right and he carried it into hell to the the Bible said he went to the lower parts of the Earth the Lord Jes now he had a work to do and the Bible said in Peter that he preached to souls that are in prison in other words he took our sins into hell now the Bible tells us that he descended into hell now he ain't going to stay long but he got to go there because there's two compartments of Hell according to Luke 16 there's a golf that's between the two there's one compartment that's called for torment with the souls in prison and there's another apartment called Paradise amen where the sons of God that have lived under the blood of the Lamb of the sacrificial lamb have been waiting Amen on the Lamb of God for two th 4,000 years had been waiting and Jesus is descending to take the sin of the world and dump it off into hell brother B said where it would stay there until the day of judgment now you think about this but while he was there amen he preached a beautiful sermon amen the Bible said he preached the souls in prison the first thing he done Amen brother Michael he had to make sure the devil knew that the sacrifice had been paid he preached in hell the power of his own death at Calvary the prophet said he looked up at the cross and he told the devil Satan I want you to look at that cross and the blood on that cross is still w but my father has accepted it for the sin of my people oh my goodness gracious brother man said that's when he kicked open the the gates of hell and took the keys from the from the devil of death Hell In The Grave he took all his keys that's why the Bible says that he spooled amen he spooled principalities and powers and made a show of them openly triumphing over them in other words when a man conquers when a man conquers a city great conqueror he would spool and he would take all the goods out of the city and take them with him isn't it something he would take the goods out of the city and he would take him with him and Jesus did this he so spooled hell until tell all the way up in the end time in the first seal amen it reveals he's got a bow but no arrows it found out that he wasn't at one weapon left in hell to defeat the church with he was stripped of every Power amen Jesus stripped him of his grave and his power so much that Paul actually even said that sting amen of death had been lost other words he you could still die but Brother The Sting of it's gone any man that dies in Christ he only sleeps and he goes into the six diens and waiting on the presence of God now what he did when he got there as he preached the souls in prison he told him how they missed him in the days of Noah they told him you turn me down when you turn down Enoch's prophesying you turn me down when you turn down the blood there with Noah and the Ark of the Covenant and Jesus was able to tell them he was the Christ of every age you see what it was they turned him down when they turned down Noah and they turned him down when they turned down Moses and they turned down it was him they were turning down is that right and he told them all that but but brother B said but see that wasn't his only job it wasn't just to preach the souls in prison and tell them what they had lost total loss the total loss was being preached to yeah now come on yeah you said preacher preaching oh yeah he was preaching now this is the beauty of this sister of Barb his body was in the grave his Spirit had went back to God but his soul had went to hell brother Brandon said he preached in hell in a theophany body come on church he preached in hell in a theophany body Oh Glory to God it wasn't a physical body it was a theophonic body it was the angel of the Lord and with their priest no wonder the prophet said in JC Pennies we're back in hell again Souls that are in prison but Jesus body's not here is it but that same Pillar of Fire has come in this last day and preaching here today the same as he did back there yes sir he was preaching to souls in prison to tell them you're not coming out of here but I want you to know where you missed it y is't that something oh they would they missed it and then he says he moved from there and he went to Paradise now that's where the sons of God were remember when when Samuel in the witch of indoor the witch called Samuel up and brother BR said it could only be done because the blood of Jesus hadn't been shed yet he said that's where the Catholic people get mixed up and they try to commune with the dead somebody said well you're communing with the Dead with Jesus no He's Alive no He's Alive Hallelujah now look at what he done these saints were in Paradise right yes sir now they were there preserved under sacrificial blood of lambs and right there in that place was high priest who had offered those Lambs all of the work of Mosaic law and the Revelation but they were still in that place but when Jesus left there he led the Captivity captive and he took the captives out of the prison doors now this is beautiful to me because when he started his Ascension he went as far down as a man could go right but when he started on his way back up that's when brother Bram tells it I don't have time to preach it tonight but you know the story but that's when Abraham and Isaac and Joshua and Moses and can you imagine what A procession the Bible says in Matthew 27 chapter it's recorded that when Jesus died the Rocks rent The Temper veil was rent the Bible said and they which slept in the dust of the earth arose with him can you imagine brother said that's when job come out and he said he standing there wasn't a teaspoon left of him right but here he is standing in his own body now here's the beautiful part of this is when they resurrected Brother Richard they're walking around in Jerusalem yeah the Bible said they appeared unto many man now you you're talking about some powerful times folks that Saints are appearing among the people now now Jesus can't take these folks into heaven yet right now this is something's amazing there has been no sacrifice on on the throne of God yet but you here here's a beautiful thing the work of Ascension now in John chapter 20 when Jesus comes it's Mary who's there at the grave right and Jesus said unto Heroman why thou weepest whom thou seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener said unto him sir if thou had borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away and Jesus said unto her Mary and she turned herself and say unto him robona which is to say master and Jesus say unto her touch me not for I am not ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God now that's amazing in the morning time but in the same day late in the evening there they are amen after8 days again his disciples we're with then that Thomas then Jesus came the doors being shut stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you and then saith he to Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reached hither thy hand and thrust into my side and be not faithless but believeing and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God anybody ever says that Jesus is not God well there's your answer yeah Thomas had his hands on him and said said my Lord and my God now what's amazing here is he just told Mary you can't touch me and now he's telling Thomas to touch my side touch my hands the prophet actually picks this up in resurrection of Jesus and he said see it's the most neglected thing any Scripture I know of is the Ascension of the Lord Jesus what he did after his resurrection now he did not sit down on the tomb after his resurrection because his work wasn't completed it wasn't finished the ones at the grave the morning was forbidden to touch him but that night they were bidden to come and fill his hands he forbid his mother to touch him and he said I've not yet ascended unto my father my God and yours and he had not yet he was only ready to do his great high priest work at that time isn't that amazing amen questions and answers brother Ram said that's right he wasn't to be touched until after the resurrection he had come from the earthy he come out from the earth and was walking among men but he had not yet ascended Mary don't touch me don't touch me I'm not yet ascended to the father but I Ascend to my God and your God and that night after he had done went up before God Amen had rose from the dead went up before God coming back he invited Thomas to come and touch his side you said preacher what was he doing in that moment of time now look look at this it's beautiful because there's actually two two ascensions of Christ because in this one he's doing it in a secret and how many realizes a high priest has to do this work alone there's nobody could go in there with him amen so watch what he does he brings out the disciples in paradise and leaves them in the city and while they're in the city amen fellowshipping one the other he slips off and Mary sees him on his way where's he going the high priest he's going into the Throne of God in Hebrews chapter n he said All Things Must Be sprinkled by the blood and Jesus becoming the high priest oh thanks be to God mdct hallelujah he went back to heavens and he slipped in there by himself and he atoned the sins of the people oh but it wasn't all there was to it friend he didn't just want to atone the blood he wanted you to know it was happening he wanted you to understand what had taken place in the secrecy of the work of the Ascension he had broke through the veils of sickness and disease and spookiness and Superstition and every Power that held you out of the presence of God and he slips back into the Earth and starts 40 days establishing his kingdom with his children and at the end of 40 days now I can't preach all night so we'll get here at the end of 40 days it's a powerful happening they're all standing out there together and there is he the high priest but now he stands among them and brother Stephen can you imagine watching the master the Lord the one that come from Heaven that has done all this work and he starts levitating and before all the crowd they saw him going into the heavens Now isn't it amazing why did they want him to see that why did he want the world why did he want his Believers to see this you know what he was doing he was letting them know that not only had I raise alone but now I'm going to take a human vessel and I'm going to return into the heavens and I'm going to show you I'm going to go sit on the throne of God and I'm going to intercede for you in a human body in the heavens so that you can know because I live you live also and you can know tonight there's somebody sitting in heaven that knows how you feel there's somebody in heaven tonight that knows your Temptation there's somebody in heaven tonight that knows what it is to be a man in the struggles and the stresses of life amen but he overcame and sat down on his father's throne and so will you overcome and sit down on that Throne listen tonight you have a power by the work of this Ascension here tonight every man of you that's got the Holy Ghost has got a right to break into the atmospheres of God to subdue the spirits of depression and negative feelings and unbelief amen and doubts and fears and every dark spirit that covers the church I say it's time to break through church break through the thing and let God Amen let his mercies be aligned with yours listen I'll tell you it's become a glorious thing to see that God is so LED captivity captive brother B said when he went up into the heavens he took all of them from Paradise with him and they walked through the streets of the New Jerusalem that he could show the the whole of Heavens that his children had been liberated oh I'll tell you this morning I believe there's a church been liberated with him I believe we've been liberated from every dark Spirit until the power of the Holy Ghost has been released and real [Applause] my it was such a rich thing as our musicians come tonight it was such a rich thing Heen I got to I got to reading this this morning and it becomes so rich to see the grace of God Amen and how that he he makes it so rich I was just I was just coming over this verse of scripture look there in Psalm 68 and3 it's so powerful in Psalm 6813 there became such a there become such a possession captivity had been LED captive and there become such a Deliverance among the people that in the Psalms David began to sing though you lean among your pots you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver brother I tell you what I w't just take a I just wanted to take a lap when I got to reading this though you lean among you hey look you got trouble in this world but God has given you the wings of a dove covered with silver prise the Lord oh church thank you Jesus y'all know Silver's Redemption right right amen do you know it's written in the Book of Job that the words of the Lord are pure even pure silver refin seven times oh my the word of God has become so rich in the church that she's been given Wings lined with silver so Preacher what's that about oh that I would be carried away on the wings of a dove might be packed out into a place yes Silver Wings tonight can you imagine Silver Wings lifts a person yeah be lean in pot now may not have enough money for the car you want or the food you desire but God has made things so rich he give you wings like with silver that in your darkest hour look at that you can just take a lift and like that Dove just fly away my brother I get to thinking about these things and I think oh God has give us a set of wings tonight he's give us Wings folks you don't have to stay in them places you're not an Earthbound creature you don't have to be settled in that you can just lift up you can transcend you can go right out of Doubt into Faith oh I tell you what a beautiful sight tonight I'll probably get on it more later but did you know doves could have Silver Wings and golden beaks oh my am that beak that gold and beat this voice of deity speaking back give you a faith you've never had before I'll tell you this work of Ascension I'm only about half done sorry this work of Ascension it's a powerful work
