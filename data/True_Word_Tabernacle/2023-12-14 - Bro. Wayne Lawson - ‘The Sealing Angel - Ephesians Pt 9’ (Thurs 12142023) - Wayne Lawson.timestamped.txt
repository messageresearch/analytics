[6:28] benefit to the area and amen and our our
[6:31] heart was to be able to further the
[6:33] kingdom of God and amen to u to lift the
[6:37] message in the heart of the people amen

[8:20] Ephesians the first chapter amen like to
[8:23] welcome the visitors tonight amen
[8:25] certainly good to have you with us amen
[8:28] Ephesians chapter 1
[8:30] and verse
[8:32] 13 uh we've been working on this book of
[8:35] Ephesians some and I I I'm not going to
[8:38] I'm going to continue in it I may not
[8:40] continue every service consecutively in
[8:42] it and but uh but it's it's uh this next
[8:45] few verses are pretty heavy on my heart
[8:47] and I just want to if I can give some
[8:50] time to it uh Ephesians chapter 1 verse
[8:53] 13 in whom you also
[8:58] trusted after that you heard the word of
[9:03] Truth The Gospel of your
[9:06] salvation in whom also after that ye
[9:11] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[9:15] Spirit of promise now let's turn to the
[9:18] book of Acts the 19th Chapter and I'd
[9:21] like to read the first six verses of
[9:23] Acts
[9:28] 19
[9:35] and it came to
[9:37] pass that while Apollos was at Corinth
[9:42] Paul having passed through the upper
[9:44] Coast came to
[9:46] Ephesus and finding certain
[9:49] disciples he said unto them have you
[9:52] received the Holy Ghost since you
[9:56] believed and they said unto him we have
[9:59] not so much as heard whether there be
[10:01] any Holy
[10:03] Ghost and he said unto them unto them
[10:06] what were you baptized and they said
[10:08] unto John's
[10:09] baptism and then said Paul John verily
[10:13] baptized with a baptism of repentant
[10:15] saying unto the people they should
[10:16] believe on him who which should come
[10:18] after him that is on Christ Jesus and
[10:21] when they heard this they were baptized
[10:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus and when
[10:26] Paul laid his hands upon them the Holy
[10:29] Ghost came on them and they spake with
[10:32] tongues and prophesied amen we ask the
[10:35] Lord to bless his word as you could be
[10:38] seated uh this these two scriptures are
[10:42] are very powerful in Reading Ephesians
[10:45] in the first chapter here and reading
[10:47] the 13th verse and then reading the book
[10:49] of Acts it kind of gives you a little
[10:50] bit of an idea because Paul was passing
[10:53] through Ephesus and uh it's a it's a
[10:56] pretty amazing Point here brother
[10:58] brandom speaks on this specific
[11:01] scripture a number of times all the way
[11:03] throughout his ministry being that he
[11:06] was dealing with a lot of Baptist early
[11:08] in his ministry being a Baptist himself
[11:11] he said that's where the Baptist
[11:12] actually had missed the truth was on
[11:14] this scripture and um and uh I want to
[11:18] read something to you out of the the
[11:20] church AG book I'm going to be speaking
[11:21] tonight from this uh Ephesians 1:13 and
[11:24] uh but I want to read this from uh the
[11:26] church age book and I just love some
[11:29] times you you get uh you get different
[11:31] things like maybe one thing said this
[11:33] way and one thing said another way and
[11:35] you can read brother brandom and he kind
[11:37] of almost sometimes like he makes it
[11:38] sound one way or another but then
[11:40] there's times where he will just
[11:42] concentrate the thought and then he'll
[11:44] just teach it very directly and then and
[11:47] then it kind what it does is it ties the
[11:49] loose ends together it ties like all the
[11:51] quotes together it ties the scripture
[11:54] together and then it leaves you with a
[11:56] solid understanding of the subject
[11:59] itself and in the church age book
[12:00] brother Ram's going to handle this and
[12:02] he says something and I just want to
[12:04] read a few phrases of it to you and
[12:06] brother R said he said now here's the
[12:08] thing he said I mean for The Sinner to
[12:11] come forward and be born again which is
[12:13] to be baptized into the body of Christ
[12:15] by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what
[12:18] took place at Pentecost when the church
[12:20] was launched in other words to be born
[12:23] of the spirit is to be truly baptized
[12:26] with the Holy Ghost it is the one
[12:29] and the same now I realized that this is
[12:32] going to be confusing for a moment and
[12:34] most people know that I was ordained
[12:35] Baptist preacher and I steadfastly
[12:38] declared that the Baptist had missed it
[12:40] for saying you receive the Holy Ghost
[12:42] when you believe amen now I don't want
[12:45] to be negative but I think we got some
[12:46] Baptist in the message these days uh
[12:49] that if you just believe the prophet
[12:50] then you got it but brother Braham is
[12:52] saying that's where you missed it
[12:53] actually he said see that's not so he
[12:56] said have you received him sensu in Acts
[12:59] 19 and2 and then brother brandom uh uh
[13:02] reads the scripture here and he said
[13:04] there it is see Paul asked have you
[13:06] received since not when you believe but
[13:09] after uh there there is a great
[13:11] difference here for it is after we
[13:13] believe that we received and Ephesians 1
[13:16] and13 is an exact word repeat of what
[13:20] happened in Ephesus according to Acts 19
[13:24] so I don't know if I ever really noticed
[13:26] him saying it that way but in Ephesians
[13:28] 1 and 13 is exactly a word repeat of
[13:31] what happened in Acts 19 in whom also
[13:34] you trusted after that you heard the
[13:36] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[13:38] salvation in whom also after that you
[13:40] believed not when you believed you were
[13:44] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[13:46] now here is my point too many of our
[13:48] modernists and even fundamentalists
[13:50] so-called believe under salvation as a
[13:53] surf a certain specific time which in
[13:56] many cases is called making a decision
[13:59] and that has been called receiving
[14:01] Christ or being born again now to
[14:04] receive Christ is to receive his Spirit
[14:08] to receive his spirit is to be born
[14:10] again to receive his spirit is to be
[14:13] born again see to receive his spirit is
[14:15] to be baptized with the Holy Ghost Now
[14:18] isn't that something to receive his
[14:20] spirit is to be born again which means
[14:22] to be baptized with the Holy Ghost now
[14:25] these folks that is wonderful but they
[14:28] stop there see you receive the Holy
[14:31] Ghost after you believe it's always been
[14:33] that way and it always will be that way
[14:36] of course uh Peter will tell us in the
[14:38] book of Acts that we should repent and
[14:40] be baptized and receive the gift of the
[14:42] Holy Ghost now brother B says see here's
[14:44] the thing Peter or none of the Apostles
[14:47] ever said be born again and then be
[14:50] filled with the spirit he said that that
[14:53] this is the pattern of experience
[14:55] relative to receiving the Holy Spirit
[14:58] note carefully the very next time the
[15:00] spirit fell upon the people let's read
[15:02] this together acts chap 5 and let's uh
[15:05] acts chap 8: 5 to 17 and this is a very
[15:08] good reading for the point we're we're
[15:10] looking at here um Acts chapter I didn't
[15:13] put that in there sorry acts chap 8
[15:16] verse 5-1 17 then Philip went down to
[15:18] the city of Samaria and preached Christ
[15:21] unto them and the people with one Accord
[15:24] gave heed unto the things which Philip
[15:26] had spake hearing and seeing the
[15:28] Miracles which he did now for the
[15:31] unclean spirits crying with loud voice
[15:33] came out of many that were possessed
[15:35] with them and many taken with uh pusies
[15:39] and they were lame and they were healed
[15:42] now they were with great joy in the
[15:45] city but there was a certain man called
[15:48] Simon which Before Time in the same city
[15:50] used sorcery and bewitched the people to
[15:52] Samaria giving out that himself was some
[15:56] great one to whom all PA had gave heed
[15:59] for the least of the greatest saying
[16:01] this man is the great power of God now
[16:06] to him that had regard because that a
[16:09] long time he had Bewitched them with his
[16:12] sorceries but when they had believed
[16:14] Philip preaching the things concerning
[16:16] the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus
[16:19] Christ they were baptized both men and
[16:22] women now Simon himself believed also
[16:27] and when he was baptized he continued
[16:30] with philli and wandered beholding the
[16:32] Miracles and the signs which were done
[16:36] now when the apostles which were at
[16:38] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[16:40] received the word of God they sent unto
[16:43] them Peter and
[16:45] John in whom they were come down prayed
[16:49] for them that they might receive the
[16:52] Holy Ghost now these people had been
[16:56] baptized but they had never received
[16:58] received the Holy Ghost for as yet it
[17:01] was he was Fallen upon none of them and
[17:04] only they were baptized in the name of
[17:07] the Lord Jesus the next verse and that
[17:10] and then land they they laid their hands
[17:13] upon them and they received the Holy
[17:16] Ghost now here are the prophets making
[17:19] the point that when they were believed
[17:21] and they were baptized but not yet
[17:23] having received the Holy Ghost now
[17:26] according to this he said they believe
[17:27] the word then they were baptized in the
[17:30] name of the Lord Jesus and in spite of
[17:32] that they had still not received the
[17:34] Holy Spirit it was only after believing
[17:36] and being baptized correctly that they
[17:39] receive the holy ghost that is the exact
[17:41] pattern set forth in Acts the 2 chapter
[17:45] now what we find out then is that
[17:46] brother brother bam is telling us that
[17:48] we have to be understand this to be
[17:50] clear that Paul never you you never ever
[17:54] found Paul at any time saying be born
[17:57] again and then be Spirit fi they they
[18:00] have inferred that it is there and they
[18:03] have put their own meaning to make it
[18:05] say that but scriptures does not say
[18:08] that but scriptures does not say that
[18:12] amen if you go to uh Joel chapter two it
[18:15] says he would pour out his Spirit The
[18:17] Book of Matthew Jesus said he that
[18:19] receiveth me shall be like rivers of
[18:21] ring water flowing out of him and and
[18:24] the prophet of God said see amen what it
[18:26] is is it that the rivers and the waters
[18:28] were the same spirit amen it wasn't two
[18:31] distinct two different things it's the
[18:33] same thing do you see that that this
[18:35] places the experience at Pentecost what
[18:39] gives the power to the church is not
[18:41] just believing the word but it was the
[18:44] experience of Pentecost amen and you got
[18:47] many people say well brother Wayne We
[18:48] Believe amen a lot of people believe but
[18:51] but you have to be careful with that
[18:52] because then a prophet would say this he
[18:54] would say the devil believes and
[18:56] trembles amen but the devil ain't saved
[18:59] and the devil haven't received the Holy
[19:01] Ghost amen but as the Church of the
[19:03] Living God not only are we to believe
[19:06] but we're to believe unto but we are to
[19:09] go on and receive the baptism of the
[19:12] Holy Ghost which is when we can say we
[19:15] have been born again because we receive
[19:18] of his life it is the spirit that gives
[19:21] life and power and it came at Pentecost
[19:24] I'm directly saying amen it is the
[19:26] spirit that gave life and Power and it
[19:29] came at Pentecost now what has caused
[19:31] this misunderstanding this is a powerful
[19:33] quote what has caused this understanding
[19:36] and the answer is experience we have
[19:39] gone by experience and not the word now
[19:42] there's a lot of people that'll take
[19:43] this specific quote and they'll say see
[19:46] then you can't go by your experience you
[19:48] got to go by the word but if you go on
[19:50] and read the quote and you don't just
[19:52] quote that portion but you read the
[19:54] quote brother brandom is actually saying
[19:57] the opposite he's saying you've used
[19:59] your experience as a measuring line
[20:02] saying basically that we have been
[20:04] baptized and we have believed and that's
[20:07] enough he said but see the word of God
[20:10] has never taught you that the word
[20:12] didn't teach that to you your experience
[20:14] may have taught you that your church may
[20:16] have taught you that a theologian may
[20:18] have taught you that but the scriptures
[20:20] never taught a person that the
[20:22] scriptures are declaring unless a man is
[20:25] baptized with the Holy Ghost he does not
[20:28] have eternal life it takes an experience
[20:32] with God Amen to have the Holy Ghost
[20:35] amen the prophet of God said we have
[20:37] gone by experience and not the word we
[20:39] need to get back to the word what does
[20:42] the word teach a man needs to go in the
[20:44] Rapture he needs the Holy Ghost amen and
[20:48] the Holy Ghost is a confirmation of your
[20:51] faith in the word of God Amen brother
[20:54] Ram said away with experience as a
[20:56] measuring line there was only one Plum
[20:58] line there's only one rod and that is
[21:00] the
[21:02] word amen it's the word it's the word
[21:05] that says a man must repent and be
[21:06] baptized Amen in in the name of Jesus
[21:09] Christ remission of your sins and you
[21:10] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[21:13] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[21:15] you believed now that was the question
[21:17] he was asking amen a lot of people has
[21:20] believed but have you received the Holy
[21:22] Ghost sent you believe listen I I want
[21:24] to say this tonight amen what we need in
[21:27] the church Church of the Living God is
[21:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it it
[21:32] it gives power to the believer it's what
[21:35] strengthens you and gives you something
[21:37] that is sustaining and gives you a rest
[21:40] now brother BR says it like this he said
[21:42] the whole of our problem is right here
[21:45] the whole of the problem the same quote
[21:47] the whole of the problem is people
[21:49] repent of their sins they get baptized
[21:51] in water but they don't go on and
[21:53] receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto
[21:56] receiveing the spirit believe Believing
[21:58] on Jesus is a step in the right
[22:00] direction which is toward the Holy Ghost
[22:02] but people stop there they go as far as
[22:04] the water then they stop they believe
[22:06] then they stop but the Bible does not
[22:08] say that you receive when you believe
[22:11] have you received the Holy Ghost s you
[22:14] believe that's the exact literal
[22:16] translation did you previously believing
[22:18] receive the have you received the Holy
[22:20] Ghost people believe and then stop you
[22:24] don't receive the Holy Ghost when you
[22:25] believe unto him having been repented
[22:28] now that's what's wrong with the
[22:29] fundamentalist is they say well we
[22:32] believed it so we've got everything we
[22:34] need when we believe but brother R said
[22:36] that's not true at all amen because it
[22:39] still leaves you wide open amen now I
[22:42] I'll say this something to you tonight
[22:44] amen it leaves you wide open somebody
[22:46] asked brother bam they said brother bam
[22:48] do we need a definite experience with
[22:50] the Holy Ghost here's his answer that's
[22:52] a good question and the baptism of the
[22:55] holy spirit is a definite experience
[22:57] that person must receive amen every
[23:00] person must have their experience with
[23:03] God all of our experiences are going to
[23:05] be different amen but we must have a
[23:08] place where we have met God and we know
[23:11] that we have met God his Spirit has
[23:14] ignited our lives amen because it is the
[23:17] spirit of God that is the Seal of the
[23:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's him that
[23:23] seals our life now I'll say let me
[23:25] reread this from Ephesians chapter 1 he
[23:28] said in whom also we trusted after that
[23:30] we've heard the word of Truth The Gospel
[23:32] of Salvation whom after that you have
[23:34] believed you were sealed somebody say
[23:37] sealed se you were sealed with the Holy
[23:40] Spirit of promise and watch uh uh uh and
[23:43] we what we know the holy spirit is a
[23:45] promise but we also know that it's a
[23:48] seal now let me just read something here
[23:50] brother bam says seal something or
[23:53] excuse me the definition of seal is
[23:55] something that confirms ratifies make
[23:58] secure it is a guarantee or an assurance
[24:02] yes amen one of the definitions it's a
[24:05] device with a cut or raised emblem
[24:06] you've all seen this amen or a word
[24:09] specifically to certify a signature an
[24:12] authenticate a document a medallion a
[24:14] ring face bearing such a device amen a
[24:17] piece of wax a wafer something to make
[24:19] an impression you've all received the uh
[24:21] the wedding invitations that's been
[24:23] sealed and or sometimes you get
[24:25] something that's got wax sealed in the
[24:26] old days they sent messages they put
[24:29] seals on them and then they uh uh
[24:31] stamped them with their hot wax with a
[24:33] certain seal in their in their signant
[24:35] ring and what it was doing it's an
[24:37] impression or a device it's a mark amen
[24:40] uh uh that uh of course that is given or
[24:43] is recognized and one of the definitions
[24:46] it's an or mental adhesive stamp that
[24:49] may be used to close a letter or a
[24:52] package in in other words uh it's
[24:55] something that secures it could be a wax
[24:57] seal on a document uh it could be a
[24:59] closure that must be broken to be open
[25:02] thus reveals tampering like uh like a
[25:04] seal on a on a window or a seal on the
[25:07] door and you put a piece of tape there
[25:09] and back in back in the days years ago I
[25:11] remember as a kid you go out on your on
[25:13] your uh electric meter out on your house
[25:15] and there was always this little wire
[25:17] thing with this tab on it and it said
[25:19] the electric company's name and what it
[25:21] was is it was a seal on that meter cuz
[25:23] they didn't want nobody fooling with it
[25:25] so they put that seal on it and it
[25:26] belonged to them keep you from tampering
[25:28] with it or they would know and another
[25:31] way of saying a seal is like uh
[25:32] something like the windows last night we
[25:35] was actually talking about it last night
[25:36] the windows in your house can they they
[25:38] have a double pain but there's gas in
[25:40] the middle and if something happens and
[25:42] it breaks the seal then the gas gets out
[25:44] of it so so it's something that seals in
[25:46] amen anybody that use an old old water
[25:49] pump anybody ever use one of them an old
[25:50] pump house water pump and down we used
[25:52] to have one down in town there where I
[25:54] lived as a kid and we'd go down there it
[25:56] had an old leak and seal on it you know
[25:59] and and what it do is it never keep a
[26:00] prime you know every time you went down
[26:02] there you you everybody if the guy
[26:05] before you didn't leave a cup of water
[26:07] you were in trouble amen but but usually
[26:09] everybody knew when you get done last
[26:11] thing you do is fill the pil up and set
[26:13] it back cu the next guy comes along is
[26:15] going to have to prime the pump because
[26:17] the seals are are are bad on them old
[26:19] pump houses amen so so it was a leaking
[26:22] seal anybody ever canned any any fruit
[26:24] or they ever canned any beans they you
[26:26] got to you got to put put the you got to
[26:28] cook it all and set them cans in in
[26:30] something and as they start cooling you
[26:32] and set in a night and you've all heard
[26:34] it and a pop and it'll start popping and
[26:36] and what's happening is the seals
[26:38] sitting on the on the canned goods for
[26:40] the preservation amen and we all
[26:42] understand seals and and we know uh
[26:44] government seals and we know uh all
[26:47] kinds of seals but we have to ask
[26:49] ourselves what is the Seal of God Amen
[26:53] okay now now to to there's many people
[26:55] and you think this would be a great
[26:56] simple subject but many people have used
[26:59] uh uh many directions to say a lot of
[27:01] things some well you know well if a
[27:03] person's coming to church all the time
[27:05] that's the seal uh maybe a person pays
[27:08] plenty in offerings and they're kind to
[27:10] the preacher and they they come up and
[27:12] shook they they dress pretty good and
[27:13] they got pretty good attitude well then
[27:15] that's a seal you see amen there's a lot
[27:17] of different ideas of what seals are or
[27:20] in other words what God's approval is
[27:22] but brother B says but you got to
[27:24] recognize that the Seal of God is the
[27:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's the
[27:30] only thing God's going to recognize is
[27:32] that Holy Ghost in the in at Thy word
[27:35] 1951 brother bam says it like this he
[27:38] said there's only going to be two
[27:39] classes in the last days right there's
[27:41] going to be them that are marked by the
[27:43] Beast and them that are sealed of God
[27:46] now the Seal of God is the baptism of
[27:48] the Holy Ghost and the mark of the beast
[27:51] is to deny the Holy Ghost now friends
[27:54] amen I I know people say well the Holy
[27:56] Ghost is something you can leave or take
[27:58] but it's not amen we are out of time
[28:01] there is no leave or take in this
[28:03] generation it's either you receive the
[28:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost where God
[28:08] seals you into his word or you deny the
[28:11] Holy Ghost and the devil seals you from
[28:14] hearing the truth of the word amen the
[28:17] mark of the beast is to turn down the
[28:19] Holy Ghost so when the Holy Ghost comes
[28:21] to your life it's up to you whether
[28:24] you're going to receive it or not
[28:25] because as a church we re receive the
[28:27] Holy Ghost right amen as a as our
[28:30] leadership and our our officers and our
[28:32] people as a whole we receive the Holy
[28:35] Ghost we've opened the doors up and
[28:36] we've asked him come on in here Lord and
[28:38] receive it but every individual within
[28:41] the sanctuary has to receive their own
[28:44] experience with God where they are
[28:47] sealed by God for Ephesians 4:30 now
[28:50] we're going to jump ahead and and and
[28:52] we'll get into it later but Ephesians 40
[28:54] 4:30 says that we should not grieve the
[28:57] holy spirit of God whereby we are sealed
[29:00] unto the day of redemption now here's
[29:02] the thing the Seal of God is the Holy
[29:05] Ghost and when a man receives the Seal
[29:08] of God we have to last how long does
[29:10] that last now the prophet said it would
[29:13] last until the day of redemption when
[29:15] you are redeemed to be with God now how
[29:17] long does the Holy Spirit seal you not
[29:19] from revival to Revival but from
[29:22] eternity to Eternity you are sealed by
[29:25] the Holy Spirit that's what the holy H
[29:27] spirit is it is a seal of God he has
[29:31] found you have found Grace in his sight
[29:33] and he loves you and he believes you and
[29:35] he has set his seal upon you I tell you
[29:39] when you ever see that the Holy Ghost is
[29:41] the Seal of God you will see the
[29:44] importance of the Holy Ghost you see the
[29:46] necessity of the Holy Ghost the Holy
[29:48] Ghost is not something to laugh at make
[29:50] fun of ridicule talk about blackmail
[29:54] it's not something to say a those
[29:55] Pentecostals all those em of people it
[29:58] it amen it's not something to talk about
[30:00] it's not something to ridicule it's
[30:03] something to set in the highest place in
[30:05] the church and say this is the
[30:07] achievement that we want every child
[30:10] every man every person in this building
[30:12] we want to pray with you we want to
[30:14] preach to you we want to help you we'll
[30:16] hold your hand we'll we'll do whatever
[30:18] we need to do to be sure that every
[30:20] individual in this place receives the
[30:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is
[30:25] essential unto you it is necessary for
[30:28] your life it's not something to read
[30:31] about and set aside you have to have the
[30:33] Holy Ghost there is a huge difference
[30:36] between a Believer and somebody who has
[30:38] received the Holy
[30:40] Ghost amen the prophet of God tells us
[30:43] this he tells us and what is the Holy
[30:44] Ghost the holy spirit is the Seal of
[30:47] God's approval in other words he says
[30:49] watch when when a man gets ready uh uh
[30:51] to pack up a a train y'all have heard
[30:53] brother bam talk about it and he said if
[30:55] it's to ship a train off he said
[30:57] somebody Stacks that train car full and
[31:01] packs it up and then seals it he said
[31:03] but now the inspector putting those
[31:05] things in there he says he has to make
[31:07] sure they're in their right place before
[31:10] he seals that car otherwise it'll come
[31:13] apart on the journey amen because
[31:16] whoever it is you know maybe you're
[31:18] maybe you're here at the train depot in
[31:20] ly they're and they're stacking a bunch
[31:21] of Munitions and they they got
[31:23] everything just the way they want and
[31:24] them babies has got to go all the way to
[31:26] Los Angeles California well the Rocky
[31:28] Mountains is between here and there amen
[31:31] there's all kinds of of changes and
[31:33] there's Crossroads and there's uh bumps
[31:35] and there's all kinds of things that's
[31:37] going to happen Train's going to rock
[31:38] maybe they got to make emergency step
[31:41] and the guy that's responsible to see
[31:43] that is from here to there is the guy
[31:45] that shuts the door on it and the Holy
[31:48] Spirit is the inspectors of our life to
[31:51] see that we have everything in us that
[31:53] we need for the journey ahead of us
[31:56] listen when God seals a Believer with
[31:58] the Holy Ghost he is saying that you
[32:00] have what it takes to go into the
[32:02] Rapture that's in our future now I do
[32:05] say this that some people don't get
[32:07] sealed with the spirit brother B said
[32:09] the reason they don't he said because
[32:10] they're living too
[32:12] loose he said see there's too many loose
[32:15] things in the house now we might as well
[32:17] just go ahead and preach hav't we some
[32:19] people don't receive the Seal of God
[32:21] because they meant maybe they still got
[32:24] their temper brother B said they're too
[32:26] loose with it they just Li off at the
[32:27] handle some people have never been able
[32:29] to train their mouth they just just talk
[32:32] anyway say anything talk about backbite
[32:35] bitterness in their heart jealousy
[32:37] malice how could God seal
[32:39] that right amen so that has to be
[32:43] corrected and then ask the Holy Spirit
[32:45] to seal that
[32:47] life are we are we are we there I don't
[32:49] I don't want to preach condemnation I
[32:50] just want to show you that the Holy
[32:52] Spirit seals you unto the day of
[32:55] redemption when he shuts the door and
[32:57] sets the seal on it he is saying that
[33:01] this thing is going to make it to the
[33:03] other end because there's a lot's going
[33:05] to happen but I just love to know
[33:07] tonight that when the Seal of God is set
[33:09] on the life that that seal is good for
[33:13] time out of the way to Eternity other
[33:15] words amen that somewhere down the road
[33:18] somebody's not going to stop that train
[33:20] and try to figure out if they can go on
[33:22] the rest of the way when God seals your
[33:24] life you may go through a lot of rough
[33:27] patches between here and there amen but
[33:29] if you got a seal on you amen there
[33:32] ain't nobody can tamper with that seal
[33:35] amen you're good to go Amen in other
[33:37] words it's a place you can rest why I
[33:39] think the Church of the Living God
[33:41] that's been sealed with a holy ghost are
[33:43] to know something that when God has set
[33:46] that seal upon you amen Amen Let me let
[33:49] me just say this very clearly dare not
[33:52] anybody touch that
[33:54] seal the prophet of God said dare not
[33:57] not anybody to touch that seal until
[33:59] it's reached its destination he said
[34:02] there it is touch not my anointed and do
[34:05] my profits no harm when God seals your
[34:09] life up brother let me say this the
[34:11] devil ain't got no business with you no
[34:13] more amen when the devil can't touch
[34:15] that life no more amen now we we're not
[34:18] getting into a we're not don't don't
[34:20] don't don't get into the negative now
[34:23] amen you said well Wayne I had this
[34:24] problem and I had this you you think
[34:26] maybe I don't have the Holy Ghost well
[34:27] sometimes you don't some people don't
[34:29] have the Holy Ghost I get that amen and
[34:31] we're not up here amen if the holy
[34:33] spirit's telling you you need the Holy
[34:35] Ghost we're not here Amen to tell you
[34:37] you don't have it if you don't have it
[34:38] because if you don't know you got it why
[34:40] not go on and get an assurance that you
[34:42] do got it but when you get it drive down
[34:45] your steak and quit asking about it
[34:47] anymore and hold on to that till you get
[34:49] to the end of the line amen I don't
[34:52] believe I don't believe we ought to
[34:53] break that seal ourself do you amen if
[34:56] God's put it on us we are to Rejoice all
[34:58] the way knowing we're on our way going
[35:00] amen because God has given it there now
[35:03] touch not my anointed and do my prophets
[35:05] no harm I love that amen I love it that
[35:08] God can give a man the Holy Ghost and
[35:11] then he can turn around and look at
[35:12] somebody and tell that devil keep your
[35:15] hands off of
[35:17] this isn't that powerful keep your hands
[35:20] off of this this belongs to me I've set
[35:23] my seal upon it amen I love when God
[35:27] draws a line and tells that devil this
[35:30] belongs to me you know what the prophet
[35:32] of God said he said this seal Came Upon
[35:34] them that were forn of God he said he
[35:37] did not come to seal somebody else's
[35:39] children he said he didn't die and send
[35:42] the Holy Ghost and then H somebody might
[35:44] get it he already knew every believer
[35:47] that would receive the Holy Ghost and
[35:49] the spirit of God has come to seal the
[35:51] forn of God to get them to the
[35:54] destination that they need to go to
[35:56] listen you can't trust your human nature

[36:01] Holy Spirit to seal his spirit in us to
[36:05] protect us from our own nature if you
[36:07] can EQ this thing it's the base is a
[36:09] little bit heavy in it amen uh you see
[36:12] the prophet of God said this an
[36:13] unpardonable sin he said the devil looks
[36:16] upon that seal and he can't come to it
[36:19] he can tease at it he can Buzz at it he
[36:23] can fuss at it but he can't get to it
[36:27] amen he can't get it because there's a
[36:29] seal of God that forbids him Hallelujah
[36:33] forbids him to touch it that's God's
[36:36] private property Hallelujah yes sir
[36:39] that's what makes a man walk boldly

[40:08] castle well let me tell you our King the
[40:10] Lord Jesus Christ amen they killed him
[40:13] in the body that was a dumb mistake they
[40:16] killed him in the body cuz he could only
[40:18] be king to a certain amount of people
[40:20] why he was on the Earth but when he
[40:21] become immortal he could become the king
[40:24] of all the nations of the earth and he
[40:26] can live in the heart of the believer
[40:28] tonight and there's a king in this heart
[40:30] ruling over this Kingdom it's the Lord
[40:33] Jesus Christ and there's no devil can
[40:35] overcome it amen oh
[40:39] Church you are dead and how's that devil
[40:42] going to get in
[40:44] there now the beautiful thing is we've
[40:46] got scriptures and we have examples in
[40:49] the scriptures of great and perilous
[40:52] times with judgments have struck you go
[40:53] to the Book of Exodus and you uh you can
[40:55] watch the Ten Commandments it gives you
[40:57] a little hint of it you can listen to
[40:59] the Token brother bam talks a lot about
[41:00] it um I I don't know I don't think I
[41:04] have the ability uh to pull you into the
[41:08] Judgment scene that was there on that
[41:10] per first Passover when God was
[41:13] executing judgment Against The Gods of
[41:15] Egypt now he was mad because they had
[41:18] kept his firstborn and his wrath was
[41:20] falling upon and judging Egypt and their
[41:24] gods now there was 10 different plagues
[41:26] right there were 10 major deities that
[41:28] were in Egypt and God was overcoming
[41:31] each one of those the like the god of
[41:33] the Nile and he was supremely overcoming
[41:35] it his wrath was coming upon those
[41:37] Nations but in the middle of that wrath
[41:40] he had children that he was calling his
[41:43] firstborn
[41:44] child and he had to have a way to mark
[41:49] them and tell the difference amen
[41:52] between the children of Israel and the
[41:55] children of Egypt there had to be a way
[41:57] for God to set a mark upon them to say
[42:01] this one's mine go around this house in
[42:04] the time of judgment don't touch this
[42:06] one this one belongs to
[42:09] me now how did they know how did how did
[42:12] the death angel know which house to go
[42:14] in and which house to not because it
[42:16] fell over all of all of Egypt amen the
[42:20] the the death angel was going into Egypt
[42:22] and to Goa was going to ever house but
[42:25] Moses had been among them a prophet and
[42:28] had said what you do is you know you go
[42:30] you know the laws of the Passover but
[42:32] let me just make a short one here what
[42:34] you do is you put the blood over it
[42:36] right you put the blood over the
[42:37] doorpost over the mantle of of the door
[42:41] and and brother B said there it was he
[42:43] said the blood on the door and the lamb
[42:48] inside now y'all y'all y'all can go with
[42:51] me real quickly because you can't see
[42:53] the Corporal body at the time of the SE
[42:56] of God the Corporal body is hid from
[42:59] view the Lord Jesus's body is not the
[43:01] lamb you can't see it right now but you
[43:04] can see the display of the token which
[43:07] is the literal life so what what the
[43:10] token is is not the Corporal body that
[43:13] literal life is the token the blood the
[43:16] baptism of the the Seal of God it was a
[43:19] resemblance of what Moses saw coming and
[43:22] Moses had him put in natural blood on
[43:24] the door because he was saying to them
[43:26] this is the only way to escape escape
[43:28] the death that's coming now the prophet
[43:30] when he picks this up he comes in there
[43:32] and he takes a little boy who's the
[43:33] first born and it would matter being the
[43:35] first born because you're the one under
[43:37] judgment and and the prophet said watch
[43:39] he's standing there and he says to his
[43:41] father what's the wind blowing out there
[43:43] that's not the normal wind and brother
[43:45] Bram says it was The Winds of judgment
[43:47] and the Death Angel was coming down the
[43:49] streets and this young man was unsettled
[43:53] knowing that people were dying all
[43:55] around him him judgment was literally
[43:57] setting in and and he said to his father
[44:00] Heen are you sure that blood's going to
[44:03] work but see a Vindicated Prophet had
[44:06] told him this is what will make the
[44:10] difference I hope you're hearing me amen
[44:12] you know maybe maybe uh maybe Pastor uh
[44:15] Pastor Benjamin down the street down
[44:17] there said well don't listen to that old
[44:19] Moses and put that blood on your door
[44:21] that it's not really necessary you guys
[44:23] believe the Covenant don't you and we're
[44:25] the Abraham seed and y'all believe y'all
[44:27] believe the Covenant God made with Abra
[44:29] y'all believe all that don't you oh yeah
[44:31] yeah well don't you worry about that old
[44:32] messy uh uh fanaticism of that blood all
[44:35] over your door like that that guy's just
[44:37] lost his mind you see but it didn't
[44:40] matter what anybody else said it still
[44:43] wouldn't keep it
[44:45] out yeah now well I I I can be real just
[44:49] real open here just for a moment with
[44:50] you but one time I heard a young guy
[44:52] preaching he's preaching his Pastor you
[44:54] know he's and I I have to be honest I
[44:56] love our church but but I don't want our
[44:59] brothers going on the field and
[45:00] preaching true word to the people preach
[45:02] the
[45:03] message I don't want our young brother
[45:06] our our evangelists and our brothers
[45:07] going out and I mean they need to
[45:09] represent us well I believe that don't
[45:10] y'all but the best representation of
[45:13] this of this church is preach the
[45:15] message CU that's what we're not
[45:17] preaching our own Ministries or building
[45:19] our own light we're preaching this
[45:21] message for the people right and and I
[45:24] heard a guy's preaching this pastor and
[45:26] he's wanting everybody to get under his
[45:27] pastor and and his Pastor was wrong in
[45:30] some areas and and the guy was saying
[45:32] well you know just believe the pastor
[45:34] even if he's
[45:35] wrong God will hold him accountable not
[45:38] you and I thought to myself we're in the
[45:41] world what Catholic dogma did you get
[45:44] that out
[45:45] of that's not in the Bible sir you don't
[45:48] believe a preacher when he teaches
[45:50] different in this message I don't care
[45:52] if it's
[45:53] me if I say something different brother
[45:56] random forget what I said amen if a
[45:59] prophet said it would take the Holy
[46:01] Ghost to tell the difference between the
[46:03] foolish virgin and the wise virgin it
[46:05] will be the holy ghost that tells the
[46:08] difference and somebody say well we
[46:10] understand all the Mysteries and all the
[46:12] seals and he said though you understand
[46:14] all
[46:15] Mysteries and have not charity which is
[46:18] the catstone which is the token of the
[46:21] Holy Ghost unless you have the life of
[46:24] the Holy Ghost you a go in the Rapture
[46:28] it don't matter what anybody says 10
[46:30] points of living a better life amen it
[46:32] won't be better in a little
[46:35] while Amen brother amen every man has to
[46:39] come subject to this Prophet brother BR
[46:41] even went so far to say this he said
[46:44] they could have took them out back and
[46:45] showed them they were circumcised Jews
[46:48] he said but L they had that blood on the
[46:50] door it didn't
[46:52] matter come on Amen and the literal life
[46:56] of this word that is coming to this age
[46:59] is not just the Pentecostal isusa Street
[47:03] Revival it is the fullness of the word
[47:06] it is the son of man that has come into
[47:09] the fullness of the Holy Ghost which
[47:11] brought the word and the spirit into our
[47:14] lives this is back to the original
[47:17] Pentecost
[47:19] right on Amen now I know people when you
[47:22] preach on experiencing things they use
[47:24] the quotes brother ra talk about
[47:26] Pentecost and they try to say well we're
[47:27] not don't believe in that but but
[47:28] brother man's talking about
[47:31] 1906 he's not talking about he's not
[47:33] talking about the acts the book of Acts
[47:36] but actually brother Bram doeses say
[47:38] that if the branch ever puts forth
[47:40] another limb it will be a continuation
[47:44] of the book of Acts and every person
[47:47] must have an upper room experience with
[47:49] God there is a seal that he sets upon a
[47:52] life it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:56] and it's the only thing that'll keep the
[47:58] devil out of that heart brother Bram
[48:00] says he said watch that boy's asking his
[48:02] father are you sure brother B said he
[48:04] said the blood was there uh years ago
[48:07] they used to sing a song maybe somebody
[48:09] look it up and sing it for me sometime I
[48:11] love it they said the winds and the rain
[48:13] but the blood is still there you know
[48:15] the blood is I think Kevin Spencer sang
[48:17] it amen the blood is still there amen
[48:20] and and that's that's the reality is
[48:23] Moses had told them what would make the
[48:25] difference am now wouldn't that be
[48:27] simple if we just heard what Moses said
[48:30] about it and if brother B says the only
[48:34] difference in between the fundamental
[48:36] Church who is the foolish virgin and the
[48:39] wise virgin is the baptism of the
[48:43] spirit my goodness then the Holy Ghost
[48:46] is going to be there now watch it's the
[48:48] only thing that's going to tell the
[48:49] difference now in so so we're talking
[48:51] about seal right so when you go to the
[48:54] Book of Exodus and you watch the 12th
[48:55] chapter that blood on the doorpost was a
[49:00] seal it sealed the believer in
[49:04] safety and it sealed the wrath of God on
[49:08] the
[49:09] outside it
[49:11] worked in Exodus the 12th chapter proves
[49:15] that God's seal no matter how silly to
[49:18] man God recognized the seal on the door
[49:22] and it worked you might have been able
[49:24] to see the light you might if you was
[49:25] stand in the street and looked into
[49:26] their home you probably could have seen
[49:28] the light from the candles and the fire
[49:30] where they were cooking the lamb you
[49:31] could have seen through the cracks and
[49:32] everything else so that blood ain't
[49:34] going to keep nothing out of that
[49:36] house but the prophet said it
[49:41] would and because it was God's word God
[49:44] saw it honored it and it
[49:46] worked see there's a seal go into the
[49:48] message of the Ark and brother B talks
[49:50] about when Noah is getting ready to
[49:52] launch into the Judgment Waters that was
[49:54] coming upon the Earth God instructed
[49:56] Moses uh Noah and told him to build an
[49:59] ark right and take gopherwood brother B
[50:01] said they laughed him to scorn over the
[50:03] gopherwood because it was such a porest
[50:05] it was such a porest board it would have
[50:07] been the last thing somebody would used
[50:08] to build a ship he said but God knew
[50:11] what he was doing because he told him to
[50:13] pitch it in and out see the gopher wood
[50:16] wouldn't be the
[50:18] seal the pitch would be the seal the
[50:21] gopherwood represents
[50:24] Humanity you can soak anything in take a
[50:27] take one of you guys and go in a room
[50:29] amen and set set you in a room with a
[50:30] certain group of people next thing you
[50:32] know you nod your head just same way
[50:34] talk same way now reason I know that I
[50:35] got a lot of Indian friends and I spend
[50:37] a lot of time in India and let one of
[50:39] them guys call me on the phone Crystal
[50:41] say what Indian brother you talking
[50:44] to cuz you it's just Humanity you you
[50:48] you you're able to pick up and and you
[50:49] talk like somebody or you take an action
[50:51] so it's Humanity but see the human being
[50:55] has no no ability to seal out things the
[50:59] human nature soaks in things and the
[51:02] gopherwood soaked in things so the
[51:04] gopherwood wouldn't be the seal the seal
[51:07] would be the pitch now the prophet
[51:10] teaches us something if you go into
[51:11] history it's more powerful and I it
[51:13] needs more time than I'm going to put on
[51:15] it but I want to just make the point but
[51:17] but but what they where they got the
[51:19] seal from Elijah is powerful because
[51:21] they got it from an evergreen tree yeah
[51:24] amen tree of life yeah Jesus was a tree
[51:28] a tree of Evergreen everlasting life and
[51:32] they would cut down the Evergreen and
[51:34] brother B said see it had to give up its
[51:37] life for them to be able to seal that
[51:40] boat so it gave up its life one tree for
[51:45] another the Evergreen for the gopherwood
[51:48] and they had to have something that
[51:51] could be applied to the gopherwood so
[51:53] when they cut it down brother BR said
[51:55] they took took the sap out of it but to
[51:57] get the sap they had to beat it and they
[51:59] had
[52:00] to basically misuse the wood to squeeze
[52:05] out because the seal for the for the ark
[52:09] was coming from the pressure on the
[52:11] Evergreen take its life take its life
[52:14] take the SAT from it after you kill it
[52:17] and then they would put it through a
[52:19] boiling process and make a tire out of
[52:21] it and then apply it isn't it amazing
[52:23] that it would take the life of an
[52:25] evergreen tree to seal the Ark in the
[52:28] days of Noah which was speaking of our
[52:31] Lord Jesus Christ who would have to give
[52:34] his life that he might seal Our lives
[52:37] our lives would sink in the waters of
[52:40] judgment today but there's been a life
[52:43] that has been given for our life and the
[52:45] Holy Ghost has been given to seal our
[52:48] boat oh I'm so glad that there was
[52:51] somebody pitched this inside and out now
[52:54] that word pitch and you've heard me
[52:55] preach on it but if you've never been
[52:57] here getting into it but that word pitch
[52:59] actually is a is a Hebrew word Cofer
[53:01] which actually means
[53:03] atonement that pitch was the atonement
[53:07] what it done is it kept judgment on one
[53:10] side and it kept the believer on the
[53:12] other side all that was Judgment of
[53:15] course in the days of Noah everything
[53:17] died in the earth except what was behind
[53:20] that pitch anything behind that tire
[53:23] never hit the judgment of God they were
[53:26] saved from judgment amen because they
[53:28] were behind the pitch listen that's
[53:31] telling us God has a
[53:33] seal you see it in Exodus 12 God had a
[53:36] seal but it was blood God had a seal in
[53:39] the days of Noah it was pitch point
[53:41] being God seal works whatever seal God
[53:45] provides it works and in the age we are
[53:49] living Paul said the Seal of God is the
[53:52] Holy Ghost and when a life is begin to
[53:55] be Sealed With God Amen it is sealed let
[53:58] me give you some scriptures Ephesians

[55:10] run out or it's going to get old amen

[55:14] tractor you want to wait a while cuz
[55:15] they're going to run out on you but this
[55:17] seal you can get it when you're a child
[55:19] and it'll stay with you till you're old
[55:22] amen it'll it'll last you your whole
[55:23] life and it'll get you through every
[55:25] situation because the Seal of God is
[55:28] unto the day of redemption Ephesians
[55:31] 1:13 amen you are sealed with the Holy
[55:33] Spirit of Promise in 2 Corinthians 1 and
[55:36] 21 now he which shall establish you us
[55:40] with you in Christ hath anointed us is
[55:42] God who hath also sealed us amen and
[55:47] given us the earnest of his Spirit now I
[55:50] want you to I want you to watch
[55:51] something that's powerful because in the
[55:54] end time we know that there's great
[55:56] plagues coming upon the
[55:58] Earth right if you go into the
[56:01] scriptures and uh let's let's just go
[56:03] over in the scripture right quick and
[56:05] and watch the prophet say this we're
[56:07] going to go to Revelation 7 Revelations
[56:09] 9 brother man says the death angels and
[56:11] plagues were commissioned by God here's
[56:14] the thing commissioned by God don't come
[56:19] near any of those who has the seal in
[56:22] their forehead yeah the seal of God is
[56:25] the baptism of the Holy Spirit see
[56:30] grieve not the Holy Spirit where about
[56:32] you're sealed into the day of redemption
[56:33] now matter how hard the ark rocked no
[56:37] matter how many times the lightning
[56:39] struck 10,000 shall fall on thy right
[56:43] and thousands to thy left it shall not
[56:46] come nigh
[56:48] theeen now the scripture tells us that
[56:52] the last plague that's going to fall is
[56:56] spiritual death let me read him he says
[56:58] it like this brother bam says the last
[56:59] plague that struck the Earth or struck
[57:01] Egypt was death Bible readers know that
[57:03] Sunday school lessons and so forth but
[57:06] death was The Last Enemy that struck
[57:08] Egypt and The Last Enemy that's going to
[57:09] strike the church now is death
[57:11] spiritually speaking yes sir those who
[57:14] will not follow Christ into the baptism
[57:17] of the Holy Spirit Will spiritually dry
[57:20] up and
[57:22] die let's go to Revelations the 9th
[57:24] chapter
[57:26] so brother way and I don't want to die
[57:27] get the Holy
[57:29] Ghost keep life in you Revelations 9 now
[57:34] watch this and the fifth angel sounded
[57:36] and I saw a star fall from Heaven who
[57:37] knows who that star was you go over to
[57:40] the next part of the verses and you'll
[57:41] find out that it was it was Lucifer and
[57:44] he was given to him the key of the
[57:46] bottomless pit and he opened the
[57:47] Bottom's pit and There Rose smoke out of
[57:50] the pit and the smoke a great furnace
[57:52] and the Sun and the air darkened by
[57:53] reason of the smoke of the pit and they
[57:55] came out of their Locust upon the Earth
[57:58] and they were given power as scorpions
[58:00] upon the Earth have power and it was
[58:02] commanded them now watch that and it was
[58:05] commanded them that they should not hurt
[58:08] the grass of the earth neither any green
[58:10] thing neither any tree but only those
[58:13] men which have not the Seal of God in
[58:16] their foreheads amen God commanded them
[58:21] yeah amen don't touch my
[58:27] oil touch not my oil or my
[58:30] wine when you read Revelations the 7th
[58:33] chapter watch in Revelation chapter 7
[58:36] we'll read something very quick that's
[58:37] beautiful here first verse after these
[58:39] things I saw four Angels standing on the
[58:41] four corners of the Earth holding the
[58:43] Four Winds of the earth that the wind
[58:46] should not blow on the earth nor the sea
[58:48] nor any
[58:49] tree and I saw another Angel ascending
[58:52] from the East having the Seal of the the
[58:54] Living God and cried with a loud voice
[58:57] to the four angels to whom it was given
[58:59] to hurt the earth and the Sea saying
[59:01] hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor
[59:04] the trees till we have sealed the
[59:07] Servants of God in their foreheads now
[59:10] the prophet of God said you see there it
[59:12] is there's the first world war and y'all
[59:14] y'all in the history of the world the
[59:17] world has never went to war yeah the
[59:20] whole world never was fighting at the
[59:22] same time but in that in 19 was it 1914
[59:26] the whole world went to war and millions
[59:29] were dying and and the Bible is telling
[59:32] us that destruction was going to take
[59:34] the Earth but there was this angel
[59:36] coming from the
[59:38] East that said hold the hold up guys you
[59:42] can't destroy this until I seal these
[59:47] see whatever that man had whatever he
[59:50] was going to do to that 144,000 was
[59:53] going to be so powerful
[59:55] that those angels was going to be able
[59:56] to let loose the judgments again but it
[59:59] wouldn't hurt the ones that had the seal
[1:00:02] upon their foreheads God's got a seal
[1:00:05] that you can stand in the greatest
[1:00:07] judgments and trials and situations and
[1:00:11] it will not come nigh thee it has been
[1:00:14] commanded of God that it cannot do it
[1:00:17] look at that first world war amen it
[1:00:19] stopped y'all know I'm telling you the
[1:00:21] truth it stopped on the 11th Hour of the
[1:00:23] 11th minute of the 11th day amen and and
[1:00:27] the whole world does not know why it
[1:00:29] stopped we know why it stopped because
[1:00:32] this angel said hold
[1:00:35] on stop hold on that's enough of this
[1:00:38] until I get the Seal of God upon their
[1:00:41] foreheads now y'all know amen that
[1:00:43] that's when Jesus said amen that you
[1:00:46] take a a Workman that comes into the
[1:00:48] field and there's been there's been 11
[1:00:50] hours and and one hires at the first
[1:00:52] part of the day and he works all day day
[1:00:54] that's brother Ericson he's worked all
[1:00:56] day working 50 years in the field amen
[1:00:59] and and and God has gave him great
[1:01:01] payment amen but watch but at the last
[1:01:04] hour just before the Rapture a young man
[1:01:07] comes in and wants to work in the field
[1:01:09] Jesus is promising the same pay to the
[1:01:13] 11th Hour worker as he did the first
[1:01:15] hour worker amen so the people in the
[1:01:18] message if you started in the 60s don't
[1:01:21] get any more than the people that
[1:01:23] started last night
[1:01:25] it's all the same pain come on Amen see
[1:01:29] the day of Pentecost they got the Holy
[1:01:31] Ghost and 2,000 years later we're
[1:01:34] getting the same Holy Ghost they
[1:01:37] got it's not a different Holy Ghost it's
[1:01:40] the same Holy Ghost the same power the
[1:01:43] same anointing the same Miracle the same
[1:01:45] sign the same seal of God is coming upon
[1:01:49] the church isn't it beautiful that that
[1:01:51] happened in the early 1900s just before
[1:01:53] the Great Revival amen of the baptism of
[1:01:56] the spirit begin to catch and go across
[1:01:59] the the planet what is it amen somebody

[1:02:19] half a week of Daniel's last 70th week

[1:02:25] bride is out of the way and this bride
[1:02:27] can't get out of the way without taking
[1:02:29] a Rapture and there can't be a Rapture
[1:02:31] till that last one gets the Holy Ghost

[1:07:09] children brother bam said that happened
[1:07:11] in Jerusalem and we all read the account

[1:07:16] account where Titus come in and killed
[1:07:18] everything but not one believer died in
[1:07:21] Jerusalem you know why because they had
[1:07:24] received the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:07:26] Ghost made them listen to the words of

[1:07:44] Ghost in Jerusalem so they're going to
[1:07:46] die that Jerusalem represented the
[1:07:48] denominational churches in the end time
[1:07:51] and they don't want the Holy Ghost they
[1:07:53] put him on the outside but by the grace
[1:07:56] of God that ecorn Rider would come by
[1:07:59] the church and he would set a mark upon
[1:08:01] his people in the last days it's not

[1:13:57] tonight so brother Wayne what does it
[1:14:00] what does it really
[1:14:01] require what CRI is are experience with
[1:14:06] God see here's the thing a human life
[1:14:10] ain't sealed without the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:14] you can you can sit and watch people and
[1:14:15] you you you can see what I'm saying you
[1:14:18] you can see people who were pretty good
[1:14:19] people and they come around the church a
[1:14:21] little bit and then they got out in the
[1:14:22] world yeah and you watch them and you
[1:14:25] just see the tragedy and you see how far
[1:14:27] they go and what and you think well they
[1:14:29] really used to believe and then they're
[1:14:30] not believeing and and it's it's it's a
[1:14:33] it's a it's a it's a story over and over
[1:14:35] and over and over and see what it
[1:14:38] is is you can live a decent life in the
[1:14:40] right
[1:14:43] atmosphere but if there's no
[1:14:46] seal you could do
[1:14:49] anything and you can get mad at those
[1:14:51] people and say well they should and this
[1:14:52] this this
[1:14:53] but listen except for the grace of
[1:15:00] God except he except God have been
[1:15:04] merciful to
[1:15:06] you you can't hold
[1:15:09] yourself you can't just make up your
[1:15:11] mind somebody they get out here and get
[1:15:13] to become dope addicts and things and
[1:15:15] I've heard people man they get rough on
[1:15:16] me and I understand it's it's a dumb way
[1:15:18] to go with life but do you think they
[1:15:22] like do you think a person actually sat
[1:15:24] down and said oh boy I'm going to be a
[1:15:26] drug
[1:15:27] addict that's what I'm going to do with
[1:15:29] my life I'm going to I'm just going to
[1:15:31] become filthy and I'm going to become a
[1:15:32] drug addict and I'm going to lose all my
[1:15:34] money and I'm going to steal from my
[1:15:35] parents and I'm going to they didn't
[1:15:37] start like that they were just like
[1:15:42] you and the Holy Spirit Come by them and
[1:15:45] they turned it
[1:15:46] down and they thought I can do it
[1:15:48] without
[1:15:51] him but you can't
[1:15:54] you can't do it without him amen amen
[1:15:57] you said brother Wayne does that require
[1:15:59] like like hours at an altar and
[1:16:02] and now we'll get into exact theology
[1:16:09] scriptural some of these people were
[1:16:12] baptized repented believing and had
[1:16:15] never received the Holy Ghost Paul laid
[1:16:18] his hands on
[1:16:19] them and they spoke with tongues and
[1:16:21] prophesied and received the Holy Ghost
[1:16:23] some of them Peter preached to them and
[1:16:26] while he was
[1:16:28] preaching the Holy Spirit entered their
[1:16:30] heart by the
[1:16:32] word and they said that's exactly what I
[1:16:35] need I receive that Lord Jesus and the
[1:16:39] Holy Ghost filled
[1:16:42] them and some of
[1:16:46] them they stood in a crowd on the day of
[1:16:49] Pentecost and said what must we
[1:16:51] do but they they all had an
[1:16:55] experience with a living God and he
[1:16:58] sealed their
[1:17:01] lives you don't never read about Peter
[1:17:03] denying the Lord
[1:17:05] again you never read about
[1:17:08] Paul going back into drugs and alcohol
[1:17:13] and he was
[1:17:15] sealed and a keeper was upon his
[1:17:18] life right so you're sitting here
[1:17:21] tonight you say well brother way you
[1:17:22] know I want to I want to have that in my
[1:17:24] life just receive himen don't turn him
[1:17:28] down don't look around and see someone
[1:17:31] under the anointing and say oh that's
[1:17:32] just
[1:17:34] fin that's just oh that's just nonsense
[1:17:36] we don't believe in that stuff around
[1:17:38] here the very
[1:17:40] one the very man who does the
[1:17:44] ceiling causes people to act
[1:17:47] unseemly they cry they Rejoice they're
[1:17:51] energized they they're
[1:17:54] anointed yes Jesus see don't throw out
[1:17:59] the
[1:18:00] one that does the

[1:18:12] Lord I'm just wondering with our hearts
[1:18:15] bowed uh there's there's a little song I
[1:18:18] was just thinking about it today when I
[1:18:21] was reading that quote brother B said

[1:18:25] the ink horn by his side he said that
[1:18:28] man is the Holy
[1:18:31] Ghost and when he said that I this
