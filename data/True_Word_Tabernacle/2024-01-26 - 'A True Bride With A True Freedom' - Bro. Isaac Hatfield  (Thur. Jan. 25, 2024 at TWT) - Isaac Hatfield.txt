house of the Lord tonight amen and thank you musicians for the songs I just sure appreciate the service Sunday what the Lord did in our midst and appreciate our brother Wayne and all the support that he's given the church and that he's given me and it's just been wonderful in my life and just the church as a whole all the support that has always been given I sure appreciate it as a young Minister and everything it it means the world to me and I know not everyone has that and so I just want to say thank you amen and we appreciate you from our hearts and if you have your Bibles tonight and you could turn with us to the Book of John have a couple texts out of John and then John 8 and then we'll go to Galatians and we'll read John 8 starting in the 31st verse says then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man so how sayest thou you shall be made free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you what whosoever commit commited sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed and then down to 43 and 47 it says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word and he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefor hear them not because ye are not of God we want to turn over to Galatians 4 for one more reading and then we can have you be seated Galatians 4 starting in verse 21 down to the end of the chapter says tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a free woman and then brother Brandon would go on to tell us that third son was that that Royal seed son not not through Hagar Sarah but through Christ The Royal seed and he said but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the Mount Si which gendereth to bondage which is AAR for this AAR is Mount Si in Arabia and anth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written Rejoice thou baren that bearish not break forth and cry thou that travest not for the desolate hath many more children than she with hath an husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as in he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free amen we could just bow our heads Heavenly Father we just thank you for your grace in our lives Lord that you saw fit to gather us together once again into your house and Lord we just believe that you've got something in mind father Lord every time you bring us together that you've pre-arranged the the moments father Lord that you would speak to your children and Lord although we don't have any ability of our own we're asking that you just come by and just take these words and just use them to speak to the hearts of your children father Lord even those that couldn't be here tonight that are homesick father I pray that you just go by their way and just send them a word of encouragement father many of them Lord are in that state for some years now Lord and and how they would long to be in this Fellowship Lord here but Lord You've not forgotten them Father and we've ask that you just go by their way and just come by the pews here every chair Lord and just speak Lord the words of life to the hungering children father we just commit the service to you in Jesus name amen amen you could have your seats if we just want to take a little thought out of that about a true bride with a true Freedom a true bride with the true freedom and and brother brandham uh deals with Jubilee uh often times he preaches return in Jubilee Jubilee year ausa Jubilee and in this Jubilee he talking about the children of Israel how they were given in inheritance and Joshua divided the inheritance you know as those names were spoken out and they were given a portion of land to to each son to e to each one that that that they would be spoken under that adoption that they would have a lotted inheritance to them and and but if time would go on and and they would come into maybe a situation of of poverty or or things like that where they would lose their inheritance God provided a way that they could return back back to what they had lost that every 50 years there would be a jubilee year where where Sons true Israelite true born Israelites could return back to the inheritance that they had lost for it was a god-given inheritance and God had provided away but it was only for trueborn Sons it wasn't just for anybody it wasn't for the servants it was for sons and brother brandom takes that and ties that back to that John 8:35 that says the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever he said he said that's why it had to be for Sons because Sons abide they weren't just brought into there by their own free will they were placed there before the foundation of the world they were predestinated onto that inheritance and and and God provided a jubilee for those Sons which came from God which were in God's mind and he said the servants get their reward but you're different as a Son of God you're different you're you're not airs with the world you're not air with the natural church but you're a different people you're separated people he said even even the Hypocrites get the reward but you're different there's something about you you've got an inheritance you've got a positional placing in this word and if you've fallen from that what man could do in failing and in sin and in mistakes what man could do in Falling Away God could do a greater work to bring you back in in all your mistakes and all your Humanity God provided a way that you could return back to your joy back to your peace back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and everything that God's provided for you but you had to know the sound of a trumpet you had to know the sound of the word that went forth which is why you had to be a son because he said my sheep know my voice only Sons could recognize that trumpet sound only sheep could recognize that Shepherd's voice and mean you can't be joined or bought you have to be birthed uh uh through by one Spirit you're baptized into one body and by Grace you could return to your inheritance and he said I believe this is the hour again of Jubilee only this time it's not a priest sounding forth the trumpet as you all know but it's the the minister sounding forth the gospel trumpet declaring onto you who you are where you came from where you're going and that you have a right to return uh for for man was not made to be a slave but man was made to be free man was not made to be caged up in in condemnation and confusion and and the the teaching of men throughout the ages who would pervert the scripture but man was made for free Freedom he said those slaves out there on those block they would take little girls and sell them he said that was never God's program that was never God's desire man was not made for that he said there's nothing to dominate over us but himself our only headship our only Dominion was ever meant to be this word was ever meant to be almighty God this word is our headship no man is our headship no denomination is our headship no idea is our headship but God's called and placed a word in this age to be our headship and mean it's he the word it's Christ the word no other headship he said he resents anyone taking over his lordship and Authority you know maybe like you go out and you buy a new car and your neighbor just comes and he just starts driving it around without asking he starts using it whenever he wants to and and Wrecking it into other cars not even taking care of it and you say well I paid good money for that I I bought that with my own money I got the deed right here that's mine and that's how God feels about his bride he paid his own blood for this bride and he resents any other lordship trying to come over his bride but it's his bride it's it's his chosen ones that he has dominion over amen even so much till he said it said that he hated the very Deeds of the nians what was so wrong about that that after Pentecost this false Vine started to get in and intertwin with that True Vine he said what was so wrong what was so terrible about it is because God never ordained that his church would be under the hands of elected leadership with moves that moves with political mindedness he has placed his church in the care of God ordained spirit filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word you see it's brother brandom's attitude on slavery he could look out and like Abraham Lincoln could say if it takes my life I'll get the slave Bell off of those slaves naturally brother Brandon could look out say if it takes my life I'll get that unbelief off the people people I'll get them free from this this bondage this denominations I'll lead them to a freedom in the word I'll lead them to a place where they can be loosed from all the confusion and the worry and all the other ideas and all if it takes my life you see he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't giv no place to the devil to have rulership in the lives of the Bride amen he said it's the saddest thing I saw was an eagle in a cage the saddest thing he saw you know when he would go to the zoo and he would would see that eagle beating its head against the cage said it's the saddest thing I saw there he was looking to that sky and because he was an eagle the only Instinct he had in him was to try to get to that Sky try to get to that Higher Ground because that's what he was ordained for he said even sadder was to see mankind caged caged up because that eagle didn't put himself in that cage it was the cunningness of man that put him in that cage and there he was under that cunningness of man and and how brother Brandon could look out and he say I see Sons and Daughters of God and they're not caged by their own decision but man had tooken this gospel and perverted it and added their own ideas into it and their own their own opinions into it and it's cage Sons and Daughters of God and held them back from their inheritance held them back from the promise of the Holy Ghost and and true joy and true peace amen he said they're caged amen but but God has provided a better way for man was not made to rule over man but brother B said God sent the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost to rule in the heart of man and mean that's the leadership he's called us to and then you see those children of Israel and maybe we've shared it before how they were back in the early days they they walked brother said that God was a father King to them God provided for them he fought their battles he won their Wars he he he brought them Mana he he he he led them to water he was he was their the father King he busied himself over them but when they looked out and they saw those Philistines led by a natural Army there's something in their hearts because man has a natural tendency to want to be ruled by men and and want to be ruled so brother brandham looked out and he could see this first church how they traded the rulership of man the rulership of a living God for the rulership of man and they looked out at that Philistine Army and said uh we want to be ruled by them we want a king like they had to lead us into battle we want a a natural leadership but but they say we still want to blow the trumpets we still want to do all these things we still want to to walk and and go into battle with the priest going before us but the only thing is we want a natural leadership instead of this Pillar of Fire that makes us different but what they didn't realize that the very thing that made them different was that Holy Ghost leadership they thought they made have thought the Miracles were coming from the trumpets or the priests but it wasn't so the Miracles came from a living God in their midst and they Creed that for the rulership of man and went into the same kind of slavery but God did not intend for man to be ruled by man but God provided a holy ghost leadership to lead the church to lead you to your inheritance to lead you to your land amen that was God's way and it doesn't do away with true men of God it doesn't do away with the five-fold ministry because men who had that spirit in them you can't separate that Spirit from that word and if a true Holy Ghost Place son or daughter of God ruling in Authority has that spirit in them they won't Lead You contrary to this word but it'll be the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's picked up vessels of Flesh and use them to preach the gospel use them to Pastor the Sheep use them to evangelize it's not the leadership of man but it's just God has took on flesh and can speak through lips amen you you say uh we don't have a headship issue we don't have an issue with the fold Ministry it's just let them be born again don't let them enter the sacred desk without an experience on the backside of the desert that God could rule through their lives anden God's always used man but man is not the leader it's God you're just a vessel that he took a hold of brother Mike that God could use your lips that you could lay yourself aside and it's he that comes in you it's he that speaks through the lips of these men it's he that uses them and and you wonder how did he know that how did he know I was dealing with that it's not them it's God ruling and leading through his sons and his daughters but you got to have men that will let the word lead that was what was so special about Joshua was though he was a great leader though he had great abilities he had enough humility and enough wisdom to let the word lead let the word lead into battle because he was under a commission stay with the message of Moses stay with what Moses said and if you let the word lead and you keep that direction it'll keep you anden you can get out in your own ideas and end up in a ditch somewhere if you want to oh but it's blind leading the blind but if you let that word lead it'll lead you into the Rapture it'll lead you to that third pole it'll lead you to everything it'll lead you to a resurrection if you just let the word lead amen but you got to be able to get out of the way and let the word lead see we're not prisoners to the church we've been called come out from among them you see brother BR we talk about these ones is that I I burn a candle every night brother brandom or I belong to the Methodist I belong to the Baptist he said people will get down to the altar and maybe even cry and get up and all they can talk about is their church and what God's doing in in their church and their new building and all this natural stuff and and they don't know church or church order they don't even have a real love for God he said it shows they it shows they got a church Spirit instead of his spirit and there's no comparison in the two you must receive the spirit of God it'll make you different I don't think we should water it down to just joining a church or sitting on a Pew the spirit of God is De dwelling in flesh again it'll make you a son it'll put you in adoption it'll change your body it'll bring you healing Deliverance it'll take you into every step of this word brother Seth it'll lead you through this scripture it'll show you things you never thought you could understand because it's not the spirit of a man it's the spirit of a God that could come into human flesh amen don't be deceived in your experience the Bond woman shall not be air with the free woman he said one is the bride and one is the church they'll not be heirs together they're not associated together they're absolutely two different promises two different times two different peoples all together one is the bride and one is the church just as Ishmael and Isaac could not be heirs together this church and bride cannot be hirs together brother Bram said it's the natural church and the spiritual church they are two different separate times two different separate people under two different separate covenants not that Mount Si you're not under that law anymore you're not under that bondage anymore you're under grace you see you got to recognize who you are in the scripture if you want to come to True Freedom you got to recognize who you are you got to recognize are you a part of the church or are you a part of the bride and if you're a part of the Bride you can realize that you're under a different Covenant you didn't deserve it you didn't do nothing to earn it but it's your land God's put you under a Grace Covenant you're not under legalism anymore you're under a message crying Grace Grace onto you you're not under the Methodist bondage or the Pentecostal bondage he say well if I don't dance it I don't got it that's legalism that that we come out of God's called you out of that legalism brother B said it's not if we dance or if we shout we've already made it God did a work in your life and the devil cannot reverse it whether you shout or whether you don't whether you dance or whether you don't whether you cry or whether you don't he said come out over my people and come into the liberty of my word oh I've called you out of that come out from among that legalism Amen brother BR said Ruth worked through those stages of legalism because she was trying to find favor with Boaz so she worked through Methodist legalism of trying to find favor through works and and then she worked through the stages of Pentecost but now she's coming to the stage of rest now she's coming to the stage you're not trying to find favor with God you're already favored you're blessed and highly favored amen the very fact that he chose you and put the Seal of his Spirit on your life shows that you're favored there's no comparison in them at all brother Brenham said when the carinal and spiritual meets there's always a clash but come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you he said if there ever was a coming out time it ought to be now brother bam said I am a segregational well that flipped the flipped the script there he said because I can't care how much they argue you cannot be a Christian and an integrationist God separates his Nations his people what does that mean I I try to look up a definition of what an integrationist is and it's to bring together or incorporate into a whole to make up combine or complete to produce a whole or larger unit as parts do he said he said I'm not a segregationist as slavery but I am a there is a segregation he said the bride of Christ is segregated from the rest of the churches he said it's the church natural and the church spiritual the church carnal and the church the word amen so we're not under a false Unity they say well in the multitude of counsel there's safety he said you better be careful who you're counseling with he said they take you can take the scripture and make it mean anything you want to he said that scripture was actually meant for war it wasn't meant for church it wasn't meant for for the believer it was meant for war in the multitude of counsel but when it comes to the church Ahab had 400 voices that were leading him straight into death but he had to come back to that one true voice that would lead him in the truth and guide him in the path that God was trying to trying to take them because 400 voices amen though there be more more multitude did not necessarily mean more truth am man and when brother Brandon was even studying on the church ages he would say go back to the beginning he said if we're going to talk on the church age we've got to go back to the beginning laying aside every statement that any man has made down through the age you see it seems like it would make more sense sister Momo I I I if we got all the voices together and all the commentaries throughout all the ages that we would have a greater truth but you got to lay aside every other voice and go back to the beginning what was at the beginning what was the truth before the foundation of the world and how can we get to that truth except God would reveal it under the servants the prophets and just a few verses before that in Amos 3:3 says how can two walk together except they be degreed amen there's that false Unity that ecumenical move that rejects the word for Fellowship they'll reject the word they'll push Christ out for more Fellowship say we want our churches to come together whether Christ the word is involved or not but I can't walk with this message and your opinion at the same time I can't walk with this message and all the other opinions at at the same time but you got to come back to the plum line back to the lifeline that guy that'll lead you into all truth me but don't put it off into another another church don't say well he's just picking on these other brothers I can't walk with this message in my opinion at the same time that's what it comes down to You' got to come out of it friends come out of those mind battles you can't walk with those opinions in this word any longer if the word says you're healed and the devil says that you're never going to be healed you can't walk with those together you got to pick one you got to choose the word choose this day who you will serve and walk in it walk in that word amen lay aside every other way you can't walk with it and walk with this word how can two walk together except they be agreed man what are you going to walk with amen he said he said lay aside those things cast down that reasoning when brother Brandon when the Lord was leading to him in the new ministry he said you walk with too many to walk with me you'll walk alone a amen and see because you might have been born you might have been born in this message but when God called you out he didn't just call you out of the Baptist Church or the Methodist Church but it's calling you out of anything contrary to this word and you can sit in the message pure your whole life and in your mind you got another opinion going on you got a voice telling you that you're not going to make it you got a voice telling you that the Holy Ghost isn't for you you got a voice telling you that maybe this message isn't right or or all this confusion and you don't know what truth really is you say well the Pentecostals have life so maybe we're just like them but it's a devil and you can't walk with that in this message at the same time to walk with this word you'll have to walk alone you can't bring any other buddies along any other voice along you got to come back to that true voice oh to walk with this word you'll have to walk alone cast down reasoning God is calling individuals to stay with this word come out from among them he said you can't be married in The Invisible Union he's he's bringing together a picture of a marriage he said you can't be married to law and Grace at the same time you you can't be you're not the Bond woman and the free woman you're you you can only be under one you can't be under the law and the grace you can't be under legal and the truth you got to come back come out from among it me don't pick up that old nature anymore when that old nature is dead young people when God gives you an experience don't go back and pick up that old nature don't go back and try to dig him up and say well well I don't know if I can let go of those old mind battles I don't know if I can let go of that but you can come to a truth that'll set you free who you are where you came from where you're going me what does the Bible say about it what does the Bible say it this message is our freedom amen not all your thoughts not all your opinions uh are pure word not everything that goes on up here goes on in here and you got to come to a place where you can discern the two you see God might even put a gift in your life and you become scared of it because maybe maybe you're sensitive more to the Lord because there's a gift in your life to sing or to preach and you let become a fear to you because you yield that sensitivity to the devil and he's always able to plague your mind and he's always able to get you under worry but God put that in your life for a blessing and don't let the devil steal your blessing don't you can yield that sensitivity to the Lord and he can work through your life way you never thought possible and mean it's a lie the devil's tried to steal your joy when it was a true gift to begin with it was a true blessing to begin with it just matters what you yield yourself to amen come out of the fear come out of the confusion God didn't make you for that you were created for more than confusion you were created for more than fear and worry and unbelief the Deep calling to the deep is calling you out of those systems he said you're going to pass Esau's Mountain but that's not your inheritance but do you hear the trumpet calling you do you hear the Jubilee sound saying there's more for you there's more than that fear there's more than that worry come out from it you were created for more amen maybe sometimes you young man get a temptation to try to be a little bit more like the world because you'll fit in more others will like you more but that's a lie you were created for more than that you were created for this word you got an inheritance am man maybe the young sister think if she just cuts her hair or dresses a little bit tighter that that that that they'll like her more she'll fit in more but you were created for more than that you were created for more than than the the the Eye Of The Devil more than a spirit of Gossip more than a spirit of bitterness more than a spirit of heaviness more than a spirit of mourning you were created for a higher plane it's a change of rulership you're not under the rulership of man anymore you're not under the rulership of a church but you come under the rulership of God he'll give you the oil of Joy he'll give you the Garment of Praise he'll give you a blessing but you got to remember it's the oil of joy for mourning it's the Garment of Praise for this Spirit of heaviness what's that mean it means you can't wear them both at the same time you're not air with this world you're not a part of the church you're a part of the Bride amen I'm not trying to make it so loose that you can do whatever you want amen this is a freedom that belongs to the bride alone it's not for the church man your neighbor may not be able to experience that freedom but the bride is under a different Covenant it's an unconditional Covenant amen that you can walk with the Lord he'll lead you and guide you in all truth amen separate and enter into your inheritance he said you got to separate from the world to be unionized with God God has ordained that his people act different from the world and it's not just what when Moses passed through that country what what made Moses different was not just the anointing because balum sat there with with the anointing as well but brother Brandon would say that what made Moses different was his teaching was perfect he had spirit and Truth he was right in line with every word that laid in the hour that he lived in that's what separates you amen there's something in you that knows truth you know the sound of the Gospel trumpet God is calling you calling a people to a higher plane calling you to be that true bride what does it mean to be the true bride brother brandom these are just things he would say about that true bride says she has oil in her lamp she takes the word and brings forth word children she's a virgin WB bride unified with the word loyal to her mate she attracts God's attention by keeping the word she's elected out of every age she listens to the spirit she has no mind of her own but her mind is his will and his word she though rejected she's persecuted she's made fun of but she's elected predestinated and forn she came from the Eternal thoughts of God she's the spoken word seed bride that can't be denominated she's separated looking up and she's going in the Rapture and God will have a true bride that but it'll have to be going back to the beginning brother brand said this is the foundation cut off those Old Rag lines there so the life can get into you then you'll have prophecies you'll have discernment you'll have Spirit you'll have power you'll have the restoration of the true church when you get back to the True Vine and the true life amen from the beginning it was not so those those false teachings those Creeds those cold formal ritualistic they weren't so from the beginning it never was so so God's calling a church back to the beginning back to the power of God back to that True Vine that back to that another book of Acts that's written behind her I mean only this time it's not through Peter and through Paul but God's writing another book and you could read that book and it looks like the exact same actions all the same verbs they're still sick or being healed bound or being delivered lost or being saved but it's a different name this time it's the name of Aaron and it's the name of Samuel and it's the name of Nathaniel because God is writing another book through this New Testament Church but it's got to go back to the beginning back to what God set in order I mean you're God's taking you back to who you were in the beginning from the beginning you were a son from from the beginning you were Eternal from the beginning you were in the back part of the mind of God brother Taz from the beginning you were a gene of God from the beginning you were an attribute of almighty God God is taking you back as an individual to who you were and it's not just who you are all of a sudden it's who you were from the beginning it was so from the beginning you were a son from the beginning you were ordained for a Rapture from the beginning you were a child of God Amen from the beginning you were built to believe this message you see brother BR would talk about that gun and he put the wrong kind of bullet in the wrong gun and it wouldn't fired it off it wouldn't fire it off because from the beginning it was not built to fire that bullet and you maybe tried to fire all kinds of things through your life you tried to fire the world you tried to fire a black sliden life you tried to fire drugs and alcohol you tried to fire all kinds of things and every time it wouldn't go off and it might have even blown up a time or two and left you with a bunch of scars a scarred passed a scarred life because you were trying to fire the wrong bullet through the gun but one day the lord gave you another bullet he said if this one don't work I'm just going to take my life what's the point of living but you put the bullet in and you fired it off and it went off with perfect accuracy because that's what you were built to fire from the beginning that's what you were always built of fire anden you put this message on and it fit like a glove oh because that's who you were from the beginning you were never meant to fire you were never meant to fire those things God's called you out of it amen and when you're out of it that Taskmaster has no has no authority over your life right now you are sons of God right now you are you are sitting in Heavenly places amen and sometimes you can come out of that and the devil still has a right to whisper in your ear the devil still has a right to crack his Whip and so you think maybe something wasn't right maybe I never got the Holy Ghost maybe the devil tries to put that in your mind that you never got the Holy Ghost because you still hear that whip cracking but you don't realize that he can't get to you he's still cracking his whip but he has no right to your life he has no right to your joy he has no right to your peace he has no right to your inheritance because the Jubilee has sounded and you're free you are a son now you have a right to have authority over that devil and and discern it as a lie cuz he which the son is made free he is free indeed like that old Johnny crow that would walk around but one day go the farmer came and on tied him but he kept walking in circles because he thought maybe that that it was just the same old day just another day just another day tied to that old devil but what he didn't realize that he was free all along and you can walk in that devil that that that Devil's lie for day after day but when Christ came to Calvary he untied you and what would set you free tonight is to realize you're already free what would set you free is to realize what Christ did at Calvary to realize that you're a Son of God that he paid for your healing he paid for your deliverance a mean you you say how can I go free uh do I have to go on a 40-day fast or do I have to kneel down and do I have to do all these rituals but that he which the son is made free is free indeed and sometimes Sons and Daughters of God get into real traps and and sometimes there's real situations that need to be dealt with maybe through prayer or or maybe through repentance and things like that but sometimes you get in a trap and it's nothing but a lie and you live under that trap for years and years because you think that that's the truth over your life that you really are uh predestined for suicide you really are you really are just a foolish virgin you really are just nothing but but a devil but you don't realize that that's a lie that the devil has spoken over your life but if you could ever find out the truth about who you are that truth would set you free and you could walk out that very moment you see under that emanci Emancipation Proclamation they had to wait till the sun rose over the hill to realize that they could go free but brother random said that the time now is the time you believe that's the time you can go free amen there was a girl a sister one time that had a dream that she was walking in white sand but black clouds begin to roll over and she got to worry and what's wrong and her son I believe and daughter-in-law were involved in the dream and said brother brandom she would begin to discuss it with brother brand said our whole family's gone to into a nervousness our whole family is walking in this darkness and we don't know what's wrong and brother brandom could take them and he could just by a simple explanation say no the White Sands prove that you're walking in Purity and righteousness the only thing is you've let the devil get get in and make you nervous amen and from that point on they could walk out of that cage me isn't that right from that point on if you could ever figure out the truth that you really are free that God's not giving you the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit if you could ever figure out what the truth was about it you could go free amen if from that moment they could walk out is said one time there was a a sister going through menopause and they told her that she had five devils and one told her that she had seven devils and she just begin to degrade until her home was a mess she wouldn't even take care of her home anymore she couldn't even do the dishes anymore she was under such a nervousness that said I'm not going to eat until I figure out what's wrong me but when brother Brandon got to her he could tell her no sister it's just the time of life you're in it's not a devil at all and she can say well do you have to lay hands on me what can I do to get out of this she said no the TRU shall set you free it was never there to begin with you never had a devil on you to begin with it was just a lie it was just a black cloud of Oppression that was hanging over you but you didn't realize that the Sun was shining all along but one day the truth came by and rolled back the clouds and you saw who you were what you had a right to amen he which the son has made free is free indeed and the spirit of Truth is calling you calling you to calling you to be a prisoner not to the devil but you can be a prisoner to this message you can be a prisoner to this word am mean this is a Revival not just of feeling free this is a Revival of being free this is a Revival of being free and knowing that you're free the the you could go and you could you could dance and you shout and we believe in all those things but the next day you feel like you've just been hit by a truck and and you feel the weight of the world on your shoulder and you go right back to that same old cage but if you could change over from basing your victory over feeling free to basing your Victory to being free it'll change your walk it'll change your talk it'll change your testimony you'll no longer be wowy wowy woo you'll be I'm a Son of God today and I'm a Son of God tomorrow if I die today if I die tomorrow it doesn't matter to me at all for death has no victory over my life the grave has no sting and if the Rapture comes the spirit that dwells in me will lift me up why should I fear tomorrow why should I fear next week why should I fear what's going on around me when I'm under a Revival of being free knowing that I'm free knowing who I am knowing where my absolute lies it lies in Jesus Christ the word not just the letter but the revealed word that come into our age and showed us there is a path you can walk that you can live an overcoming life you got to walk it may be straight and narrow you may have to walk alone but if you just stay there may my prayer many times is Lord just take me by the hand and walk me through your word walk me through this message lord I can't understand it I have no ability of my own to understand it but Lord if you just take me by the hand I I you can lead me you can guide me why what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost in your life you could receive the message of the hour you could receive the word for your day but that ability to hear came from God and God alone because this Jubilee is for Sons this Jubilee isn't for servants why could you receive this word because you're a son how could you enter into this Jubilee because you had god-given hearing that before the foundation of the world you were ordained to hear this message amen it's not it's not speaking in tongues it's not even the fruits of the spirit the evidence is to receive the word because he'll send you a spirit of Truth and that Spirit of truth will lead you and guide you into all truth God is bringing the church back back to what it was in the beginning brother Brandon would say at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original life back to the Bible and it must have all the word to be the seed which is why we needed Malachi 4 why we needed Revelation 10:7 because you couldn't be a true seed without a true word to bring you back to that original condition and that life that was in the tassel and the and all these things is gathering into the seed amen not just the gifts but the life of the gifts more than just the gift but the life of the tastle the life of the Methodist the life of the Pentecostals coming into that fullness that seed because brother brandom said he said at the end of the lean age just before Jesus came the church would go back to being a wheat seed bride while the tears would be harvested and burn in the Lake of Fire and he said the tears are already maturing fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people from the word but the wheat also must mature and to her God is sending the prophet messenger with the Vindicated mystery that Ministry that he might be accepted by the elect God will have a wheat seed bride God will have a bride God will have a true bride a true bride that is truly free me and he sent us the spirit of Truth to lead us into truth you see he didn't just call us out brother Seth out of the denominations but he said I'll give you a guide and who'll lead you into all truth you see that false Vine was saying that you got to come to us to hear it's hard to understand this word it's hard to understand these Revelations uh you come and we'll put a priest you see because brother Chris when they started teaching that Nic Doctrine he said it was it didn't go over good with some people because they had the ability to read and and they could say no that ain't right and so they had to try to kill all those off until they could form the religion that said no you got to come by us the priest can read the priest can understand it takes a special person to understand but God had a different plan for his bride he said I'll send you a guide I'll send you a spirit of Truth and he'll lead you into all truth man brother Brandon Tells a Story one time about being lost in the woods and he was on his honeymoon and he had it perfectly arranged that it was during hunting season and mean I I think maybe some of you would do that if you could I I I think brother Jeremy's is during elk season amen but but brother Brandon wasn't too upset about it and the Lord actually gave him that day anyhow but he was out in the woods and he said he said uh well why don't you stay here and I'll go get us some meat from the winter I I'll go get us a nice deer and and a nice bear and and you just stay here and she said all right but just remember I I'm not used to this Wilderness I I don't know what I'm doing out here and so brother Brandon said you know okay you know I'll be I'll be back by dark and things and so he goes out and he starts looking for a deer starts looking for a bear and he goes out and he sees a cougar and and he goes out and he he smells a bear and and all of a sudden he this black figure pops out and it was a deer and he kills it and he starts dressing it but all the while fog was starting to settle into the woods and it was starting to get a little darker he says so he thinks my I better get back to my to my wife and my baby uh they're back at home and they won't know what to do if it gets dark and it gets cold and so he starts walking back and he starts walking and he's walking for about 30 minutes 45 minutes and all of a sudden he looks up and there's his deer again he's like my what did I do wrong how did I end up back here and he started getting into what they call the Indian death walk walking in circles walking around and not really getting anywhere and he he goes and he walks again and he goes and walks again for another while and he sees his deer again and he thinks my what's wrong how did I end up here and so he starts saying well Bill you can't get lost you're you're you're the greatest Trapper there ever was you you're the son of an Indian and and you can't get lost and but all the while that subconscious was telling them that you're getting nervous you don't know your way back your wife are going to die tonight if you don't get there and he starts walking in circles and it starts getting darker and darker and he and all of a sudden he hears a voice speak out I'm a very present help in the time of trouble I I'm a very present help in the time of trouble and here he was walking in circles and and maybe sometimes you found yourself in that same spot the fog starts settling in and you find yourself in a confusion you're walking in circles you don't know who the real you is you think you're ordained for the message but there's another voice you're trying to serve the law and Grace at the same time but God is not the author of confusion there is a truth and you walk in circles wondering wondering if it's for you wondering if you're going to make it walking in that confusion but a voice spoke out I'm an everpresent help in the time of trouble and so he just began to walk and he begin to think oh my God this fog has settled in it's too late now I'll never be able to get back I'll never be able to get back to my family and so he kneels down and say Lord forgive me Lord forgive me for my pride thinking that I was somebody thinking that I was a Trapper thinking that I could make it back on my own Lord forgive me lead me the right way I won't be able to make it back without you Lord I need you to be my guide and he got up and he said all right I've got to be determined this is the way I'm going to walk and he starts walking that away and a hand reached out and laid on his shoulder brother Mike and turned him around and brother random said God cleared the fog back for six miles and he saw Hurricane Mountain and he started walking towards that mountain he didn't turn himself around in his own ability to guide he would have been in Canada somewhere but God put a hand on his shoulder a god rich in Mercy turned him around and said this is the way to walk it was that same hand that could come into the room before he went to preach the seals he said I wouldn't make a huge mistake today if God didn't come and meet me in my room and show me the truth of this it's the spirit of truth that's leading this bride it's not the ability of a man it's not the ability of you to overcome but God's planted a seed in your life and you can't be deceived because you're not a part of this Bond woman you're a part of this free woman God's putting you a jean seed to lead you into all truth and you're a virgin wom bride because God got to you before the devil ever could and sealed you sealed that womb to only receive this word seal that room till the only trumpet you could hear is this Jubilee trumpet that could declare unto you I'm free return return to your inheritance anden the elect cannot be deceived in your own ability you would have in your own ability how many times would we have got off these men that have preached for years if it was their ability they would have got off somewhere but it's more than their human ability it's the spirit of truth guiding their lies guiding them into Revelation guiding them into truth amen and all of a sudden that Spirit of Truth starts speaking out to you during this service and starts to dissolve your doubts amen have you ever been there where you're sitting in the right in the Pew and all of a sudden it's it's no longer just brother Wayne or Brother Ray it's another voice that's coming by your way and it begins to discern your heart and it begins to tell you that you don't have to be a slave to that fear you don't to be slaved to that depression any longer the spirit of Truth is concerned about this bride concerned about getting her home me we were sitting in the house the other day and our little baby was born with toric callus a crooked neck and a stiff neck and because of the way he would lay he was born with this anden and and I was worried about it but Bethany especially gets a real burden for the baby that's the mother gets a real burden for that baby and she was worried about that baby and she would do exercises with him but one day she's just sat down from cooking supper I think it was and turned on the prophet and he just starts going through the end of the service and he's just going through and all of a sudden he calls out you mother you got that baby with the crooked neck if you just believe he'll be healed anden it's more than the ability of a man it's the spirit of truth that's concerned about you concerned about where you're at concerned about that cage that you've been beating your head against for years and years that cage of condemnation that cage of fear amen come out from it that Spirit of Truth still brooding still speaking talking with brother Tyler Rachel earlier about a time he was sitting in his car and he was listening to that discernment line and he was having a back problem and all of a sudden brother brandom's just Discerning those situations and just discerns that back problem and and somebody in the line and he said that substance Faith just dropped down in his heart and he was instantly healed in that moment amen he hasn't left that guide has not left the church that Spirit of Truth is still here leading you into all truth leading you to the Millennium Hallelujah sons of God they're led by the spirit of God Amen and you're going to be marked yeah yeah you're going to be marked one way or another friends anden and those who did not receive that trumpet they were marked in their ear they were marked where they couldn't hear that word anymore they couldn't go free no more they that was the mark that went to those who would not hear that Jubilee trumpet but brother B said God marks his when they come God marks his by vindicating his promised word through them amen you'll either be marked in your ear never to hear again or you'll be marked for the Vindicated word couldn't hear the Glorious gospel no more but he said ours will brother B said these will be marked John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and me what is the father's business that this bride is about it's to vindicate the word vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate Revelations 101 107 you're about the father's business you say what is truth what is truth pilate asked that question one time amen Jesus said thou sayest I'm a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice and pilate saith unto him what is truth and there the very truth was standing right in front of him the one that said I am the way the truth and the life not just the letter but the truth the word that was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and mean in The Book of Revelations he said these things sayth he that is Holy he that is true and so we find that the one was standing in front of pilate was a man of truth but brother BR said that word true it doesn't just mean opposite of false it means per perfect realization in contrast to partial realization standing right there in front of pilate was the one that when they spoke of the Bread of Heaven when they spoke of the Mana that would come down he was that Bread of Heaven when they spoke of the vine that would bring forth branches he was that vine when they spoke of one likened onto the prophet Moses he wasn't just a prophet he was the prophet he wasn't just one like unto David he was one greater than David he was the perfect realization of every scripture spoken over his life it wasn't just the truth that laid in the Scrolls the truth was standing there in flesh the perfect realization amen and people going about in this age today looking where is truth do the Methodist have it do the Baptist have it do the Pentecostals have it but I say I'm looking at it I'm looking at truth it's standing right in front of me God has took on flesh and brother bam said he this word was made flesh and it wants to be your flesh and mean you're not just a bride you're the bride it's the greater than Esther the greater than Sarah and Rebecca the one that fulfilled all these types is standing on the Earth today tabernacled in flesh it's the truth the perfect realization amen and this bride is free it's a free bride and we could spend all this time talking about the freedom of the Bride but if you can't determine whether not you're that bride then you'll stay in that cage you got to recognize who you are because although the bride is free you can still be an individual slave in your mind but the Bible said Paul told us be not entangled again with that yoke of bondage that yoke of fear you know you wake up afraid you go to bed afraid you're afraid you're going to miss the Rapture you're afraid you're not good enough afraid no one loves you afraid you're not good enough for this message afraid of death afraid of defeat afraid to claim your inheritance but God has not given you the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and then that devil starts to put that condemnation on you because you felt a little fear and you think I'm I'm a holy ghost Christian I I shouldn't fear so it starts putting condemnation on you something's wrong with me and until you can't hardly pray you can't hardly talk to the Lord you're beating your head against that cage over and over again but you can come back to the truth come back to what the word says about it and there's no judgment to that Royal seedu a perfect blood that has perfectly loosed you and you're wondering about your future you see Sarah brother Wayne how could Sarah how could Sarah laugh in her heart at the promise promise how could Sarah in that condition yet God would choose her to bring that seed through because she was a part of Abraham look in brother brandom's meetings a a a Critic would rise up and half the time they'd have to pack him out or they'd walk out and be hit by a car but something in Sarah she was a part of Abraham and something in Paul Paul could go and persecute those Christians and God didn't strike them dead but God went and crowned his life to be the first messenger what was it it was under a different Covenant he wasn't under the law he wasn't under the bondage of Mount Si God was calling them to a different Covenant I've called you to be my messenger I've called you to be my bride amen and you worry about your future worry about where you're going to end up am I going to go to hell am I going to go am I going to go into all these these problems but can I tell you this if you're a part of that bride your future is wherever Jesus is there you will be also but will this bride going to Hades brother Brandon talks about it in the church age book I believe it is about how how how this bride won't go into Hades how could she go when she's been bought when she's been redeemed but your future is wherever Jesus is there I will be anden that'll bring a peace to your mind wherever Jesus is I will be also Hallelujah and then he said they will never come into con condemnation they will never be in that Lake of Fire they can never be lost for he will lose none of them not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where Jesus is hallelujah amen it's what sets us free tonight it's the revealed truth that sets us free anden and you don't have to stay bound to lie anymore cuz from the beginning it was not not soj and and maybe I just read this quote as we bring it to a close brother Bon said do you believe that message is the truth do you believe it back to the beginning back to the beginning if somebody says I don't believe in Divine Healing you say it wasn't so from the beginning I don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't so from the beginning I don't believe in Divine Healing it wasn't so from the beginning for in the beginning they believed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost they believed in speaking with tongues they believed in all the spiritual gifts Paul wrote them in the book of Corinthians and set the church in order that's the way it was at the beginning that was the will of God at the beginning and he is the infinite God he cannot change if that was his will at the beginning that's his will tonight anything contrary to that is thieves anything contrary to that is a thief amen and that Thief goes about trying to steal trying to kill and trying to destroy he goes about like shamgar trying to steal all your joy trying to steal all your peace that thief's going about trying to steal it but the only way he could ever do it is through a lie the only way he could ever do it is by something that wasn't so from the beginning and he goes about and there Comes A Time in your life when you say I don't have to live under that anymore like shamgar could say I've got a right who is this uncircumcised Philistine anyhow when I'm a circumcised Son of God and I but when those thiefs would try to come in God would put it in a shepherd's heart to lay at the gate and guard those thieves from robbing those sheep and from stealing and killing and me and God could put it in a Shepherd's Heart like your pastor to stand at that door and preach the truth every service he could stand there and preach it and if he had his own ability if he could in his own ability come and open that cage to let you out he would how he would how it would burn in his heart just to be able to open that cage but God has God has ordained brother brand said you're an eagle in a cage and you're just as helpless as can be L somebody would come by and open the cage and brother B said God did that and calling you he opened the cage to let you out so all he can do stand up here and declare that word over your life stand up here and sound that trumpet over your life knowing that a true son will hear it and return to his inheritance amen but when God ordained this scripture and God put in there the truth of water baptism he put in there the truth of Pentecost he put Matthew to stand there as a guardian of that truth there stood Matthew with the truth of the Sacred baptism there stood Mark Luke and John guarding that Pentecostal truth that Pentecostal Church amen and it was the truth that's your guard that you got to let the truth be your guard amen the devil's going about like a thief but he's a liar but the truth is your guard that brother Wayne might not always be around but in your prayer closet all of a sudden that Spirit of Truth starts to settle in and brings to Rememberance those scriptures those quotes you start worrying well maybe I I'm not going to make it after all and then that Spirit of Truth just begins to settle over you you've already made it it's not if you're going to make it you've already made it and that truth just begins to guard you from that lie that tormenting spirit all of a sudden you just feel a different atmosphere to begin to settle in so that's right that's the truth about it I may not feel free right now but I know by the word I am free I know by the word I have a right to my inheritance as a son of God and then just abide there just abide in the truth if it don't happen today it'll happen tomorrow if it don't happen tomorrow it'll happen the next day because you are sons of Abraham you are the Seed of Abraham and it'll be a greater testimony tomorrow than it was today amen you that have been going through longlasting trials it'll be a greater testimony tomorrow than it was yesterday and you're the Seed of Abraham and so you just keep holding on to that truth holding on to that amen as the musicians come you may be in that cage tonight amen you may be in that cage that cage of confusion where you don't really know if it's for you or not you know that's a tough place to be where you hear about the millennium my you start listening about the future home and the greatest fear or bondage the devil try to put on you is that you're not going to be able to enjoy that you're not going to be able to partake in that and that would be the greatest fear because you know the the bride belongs to those things and you know that it's for the bride but the devil will try to keep you in that cage so that way you can't enjoy your salvation you can't enjoy your Liberty you can't enjoy your sound mind but God could come by and just in a moment that truth could just come and settle and open that cave that you could go free that cage of that cage of offense that that John found himself that one time Amen brother Carrie that eagle was in that cage God wasn't using them and so the devil started working on him and I remember you sharing some of those things with me but that cage of of offense here he was he introduced the Lord you know as a as a mighty God as the mighty coming of the Lord and here he was meek and lowly and there he is wondering in his cage have I believed on the wrong thing why hasn't it happened yet why are things taking so long and started to get into a cage of offense why why are we still here why hasn't these things come to a manifestation why hasn't the Rapture come yet why hasn't my prodigal come home yet why hasn't this happened why am I still sick it's a cage of offense that the devil will try to keep you in but if you just let the word lead say Lord You're my guide and Lord I'm just going to walk with you amen as long as he is here what doesn't matter anyhow it's being fulfilled right according to the symphony the word is beginning to beat those drums are are sounding everything's right in step your healing is Right In step your deliverance is Right In Step everything's right in order the coming of the Lord is right as it should be amen you can follow that
