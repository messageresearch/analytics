[42:23] wanted to she couldn't have got up and
[42:25] mov cuz there's no there's no muscle
[42:26] memory left and the muscles have all
[42:29] gone by that time but you know brother
[42:31] Brown was out in the woods praying and
[42:32] that great Angel of the Lord came by he
[42:35] said you go by the way of Carter she's
[42:37] going to raise up from that bed today
[42:39] and the prophet said I walked in that
[42:41] house and when I walked in I looked down
[42:43] on the bed and he said Georgie in the
[42:45] name of the Lord Jesus rise up and walk
[42:48] amen and he said as I heard myself say
[42:50] that I said how in the world will that
[42:53] girl ever walk come on but brother Bram
[42:55] said but see there's a hidden power
[42:57] right and that power in the word she was
[42:59] going to walk that day it wasn't by the
[43:01] strength of her legs but it was the
[43:03] power of the word of God that was going
[43:05] to cause her to rise up and you know
[43:07] when I think about it today I tell you I
[43:09] believe it's time to throw away the
[43:11] crutches on Amen the little feelings and

[1:05:08] the way that you know and Thomas saith
[1:05:11] unto him Lord uh we know not whether
[1:05:14] thou goest and how can we know the way
[1:05:18] and Jesus said unto him I am the
[1:05:22] wayen the truth and the life amen what a
[1:05:27] way to put it I am the way the truth and
[1:05:31] the life and no man cometh unto the
[1:05:33] father but by me and if you shall ask
[1:05:36] anything in my
[1:05:38] name I will do it that's pretty simple
[1:05:42] isn't
[1:05:42] it I will do it now the scripture says
[1:05:47] and brother Brandon would teach us that
[1:05:49] in a symphony there's always
[1:05:52] Junctions I've just read to you a few
[1:05:54] Junctions yeah your future
[1:05:57] home
[1:05:59] yeah wedding supper right now Jesus is
[1:06:03] promise I just did it in a backwards way
[1:06:07] cuz I want to catch
[1:06:09] you he's told you I'm going to build a
[1:06:12] place for you right now watch another
[1:06:16] Junction a prophet stands and says For
[1:06:19] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:06:23] given and the government shall be upon
[1:06:24] his shoulders and his name Shall be
[1:06:26] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:06:30] God the Everlasting
[1:06:33] father the Prince of Peace amen that's a
[1:06:36] powerful statement in
[1:06:39] it in Isaiah chapter 60 in verse one
[1:06:43] arise and shine for thy light has
[1:06:46] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:06:50] upon thee second Peter would say it like
[1:06:54] this in verse one and verse 16 for we
[1:06:57] have not followed cunningly devis fables
[1:07:02] we were made known unto you by the power
[1:07:04] of the coming of the Lord Jesus but were
[1:07:11] eyewitnesses
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:13] eyewitnesses your eyewitnesses to what's
[1:07:16] going on right
[1:07:18] now of his majesty for he received from
[1:07:21] God the father and the glory and the
[1:07:23] honor when when there was such a voice
[1:07:25] to him that was from the excellent Glory
[1:07:29] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:07:32] pleased amen and this voice which came
[1:07:35] from heaven we heard and we were with
[1:07:37] him in the Holy Mountain and we have a
[1:07:41] more sure word of
[1:07:43] Prophecy and a We believe We
[1:07:48] Do where unto you do well when you take
[1:07:51] heed as a light that shineth in a dark
[1:07:53] place under the day Dawn and that day
[1:07:56] star arise in your hearts knowing this
[1:07:59] first that no Prophecy of the scripture
[1:08:01] is of any private
[1:08:04] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:08:06] in Old Time by the will of man but holy
[1:08:11] men of
[1:08:17] God wrote the Sheep
[1:08:22] music holy men of God wrote the Sheep
[1:08:29] music and spake as they were moved by
[1:08:33] the Holy Ghost now I want to catch you
[1:08:36] again Revelation 5 and verse 9 and they
[1:08:40] sung a new
[1:08:43] song we got you now back into it and
[1:08:47] they sang a new song Thou Art Worthy to
[1:08:49] take the book and to open the seals
[1:08:51] thereof for thou was
[1:08:53] slain and H has redeemed named us to God
[1:08:56] by our blood of out of every Kindred
[1:08:59] tongue people and
[1:09:01] nation and it's made us unto our God
[1:09:05] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:09:09] the
[1:09:10] earth and if that's the Sheep music
[1:09:13] that's what we'll
[1:09:17] play brother brandom says this and this
[1:09:20] is very pertinent to the hour and
[1:09:22] brother Tim even mentioned it last night
[1:09:24] like is
[1:09:26] back in her Promised Land she don't even
[1:09:28] know how she got back there yeah she was
[1:09:31] just automatically put back there why
[1:09:34] National Force put her in her place he
[1:09:38] says now I'm going to say something
[1:09:40] National Force put Israel in her
[1:09:42] Homeland and National Force will put the
[1:09:45] church in the world Council of churches
[1:09:48] but the power of
[1:09:51] God will put the people and the bride
[1:09:55] the world faces forces this way and the
[1:09:59] world forces that way but God forces
[1:10:03] upward only a
[1:10:06] prophet could put it like
[1:10:09] this not a politician but a prophet
[1:10:12] could put it like this and he says the
[1:10:16] world forces this way and the world
[1:10:18] forces that way but God forces upward
[1:10:21] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:10:23] God my word is spirit and life will put
[1:10:28] the bride in her place cuz she'll
[1:10:31] recognize her position in the word and
[1:10:34] then she's in Christ and and will put
[1:10:37] her in her place no National
[1:10:40] Force we'll do it but the National Force
[1:10:44] will drive Israel to her the Homeland
[1:10:46] National forces will will to the church
[1:10:49] to the the Council of churches will
[1:10:51] drive every organization but the power
[1:10:54] of God that's right will raise the bride
[1:10:58] into
[1:11:02] Glory I like that it's not up to a man
[1:11:06] it's not up to
[1:11:07] governments God's in control of this
[1:11:10] whole
[1:11:12] thing now when we think of that 40
[1:11:14] different writers under the same
[1:11:17] inspiration come on of God himself
[1:11:20] writing his word yeah not one word will
[1:11:24] f to the ground heavens and earth will
[1:11:28] pass away but my word will never pass
[1:11:33] away then he would say it over and over
[1:11:36] again these are the true sayings of
[1:11:39] God now if we can just say this tonight
[1:11:42] Moses played his
[1:11:45] part John played his
[1:11:48] part sometimes in these writers as they
[1:11:51] begin to write the word they're in
[1:11:52] strange conditions yeah you you would
[1:11:55] think that he's going to write the Book
[1:11:57] of Revelations might be in a posh office
[1:12:00] or somewhere another but let's pick a
[1:12:03] different place I'm going to put him in
[1:12:05] the worst prison that there is on an
[1:12:09] island right and I'm going to put him to
[1:12:12] where that none of the other prisoners
[1:12:14] are going to know what's going on
[1:12:16] they're going to try to ball him with
[1:12:19] a but I'm going to I'm going to allow
[1:12:22] him to write the most powerful
[1:12:25] scriptures cuz there's a bride that's
[1:12:28] going to come and play the music
[1:12:35] out amen I as I think about these things
[1:12:39] I I kind of
[1:12:42] amused when I was a young man they they
[1:12:45] sent me I was one of two in the state of
[1:12:48] Virginia and then about a hundred
[1:12:50] students from all over the United States
[1:12:53] were gathered and we were gathered and
[1:12:55] we were part of a special class and and
[1:12:58] they they took us to two different
[1:13:00] Symphonies well I'm a country boy
[1:13:03] putting up py
[1:13:07] cows pigs and and I find myself in a in
[1:13:12] a
[1:13:13] symphony all right blue jeans button-up
[1:13:17] shirt it was requirement button-up shirt
[1:13:20] and so I I wore that I didn't understand
[1:13:23] why I was there and musicians it was a
[1:13:26] national National Orchestra and so
[1:13:29] musicians are brought from all over the
[1:13:32] world and and there's a guy comes out
[1:13:35] with a
[1:13:39] stick and each one comes to their place
[1:13:42] and each one does what they're supposed
[1:13:44] to do and everything's brought to order
[1:13:47] I'm sitting in an audience of maybe
[1:13:49] 10,000 people and I'm sitting there and
[1:13:51] I'm thinking why am I here well you're
[1:13:54] going to be the benefit bit of why I was
[1:13:56] there all
[1:13:58] right and to get the point I had to go
[1:14:00] to two of those and then I went to a a a
[1:14:04] play there in Washington and I can
[1:14:06] remember the name of the play much a do
[1:14:08] about
[1:14:12] nothing and that's what it was much ad
[1:14:15] do about
[1:14:17] nothing you know I was raised in the
[1:14:19] message but you know I didn't catch it
[1:14:22] much just being raised in the message I
[1:14:25] I knew God sent a prophet and and uh one
[1:14:27] of the worst fights I was in in a bar
[1:14:30] was somebody told me brother Brandon
[1:14:32] wasn't a
[1:14:33] prophet it wasn't a good day for that
[1:14:36] guy just wasn't a good
[1:14:39] day I wasn't converted but you remember
[1:14:42] those days brother Wayne brother Tim
[1:14:45] escaped it
[1:14:47] but I
[1:14:50] won you know if you're going to fight
[1:14:52] win
[1:14:57] amen I'm sorry sister
[1:15:01] Connie and then as I begin to study the
[1:15:03] message you know brother randam has
[1:15:05] preached the message the book has become
[1:15:07] open the most important word that's ever
[1:15:09] been delivered to a body of Believers
[1:15:12] and then he becomes down in in Shalom
[1:15:16] and and he and he and he makes mention
[1:15:18] of it in many other places but
[1:15:20] especially in
[1:15:21] Shalom because the message is more than
[1:15:24] just to be in tape form and more than
[1:15:27] just to be in book form but it's to be
[1:15:30] living in
[1:15:33] flesh and we're more than just a group
[1:15:35] of Believers that have gathered and and
[1:15:38] we sit and say amen and and worship the
[1:15:42] word but this word's got to come to
[1:15:47] life so brother R begins to say he said
[1:15:50] his word is like a great Symphony and he
[1:15:53] said how many of you ever heard of syph
[1:15:55] and he said well everybody has has
[1:15:57] everybody
[1:15:58] had and he says now remember a symphony
[1:16:02] is when music is played in a drama he
[1:16:06] said I think of that Symphony of Peter
[1:16:08] the wolf and you remember that old Story
[1:16:11] how they used to and I've heard that how
[1:16:13] they take the drums and a little
[1:16:14] woodpecker pecking and Peter going out
[1:16:17] and growling of the wolf and and a and a
[1:16:19] toting of horns a
[1:16:23] symphony so so you begin to look at what
[1:16:26] a symphony is made up of and it's more
[1:16:28] than just one piece of music or small
[1:16:31] pieces of music but sometimes there's as
[1:16:33] many as 300 different pieces of music
[1:16:36] that has been gathered they'll have
[1:16:38] blind auditions and if you can just let
[1:16:41] me bore you for a moment but they'll
[1:16:42] have blind auditions for for a certain
[1:16:45] part when there's availability and and
[1:16:47] they'll send out not just to the local
[1:16:50] community but all over the world because
[1:16:52] we've got to have the best of the best
[1:16:56] yeah and there'll be flute players and
[1:16:59] trombones and there'll be drums and
[1:17:01] there'll there'll be all different kinds
[1:17:03] of
[1:17:04] instruments and you got to remember that
[1:17:06] there's got to be practice involved and
[1:17:08] and you got to have just lay down
[1:17:10] everything of your background and now
[1:17:13] when you begin to come together you've
[1:17:15] got to know what your music says right
[1:17:19] right and you got to study that music
[1:17:22] and to study the music you've got to go
[1:17:24] back can study maybe Beethoven or Bach
[1:17:29] or or the son of man
[1:17:33] Ministry you've got to know it you've
[1:17:35] got to believe it it's got to become a
[1:17:37] part of
[1:17:38] you and you got to you got to play a
[1:17:41] certain instrument that reflects you and
[1:17:44] because everybody's got a part every one
[1:17:47] of you's got a part all over the world
[1:17:49] we got a part from the littlest to the
[1:17:52] greatest every one of us has got a part
[1:17:55] to play and actually your body is an
[1:17:59] instrument through which God wants to
[1:18:01] breathe
[1:18:03] [Applause]
[1:18:04] through he wants to take your life and
[1:18:07] and sound the music of the
[1:18:11] message now you got to understand just a
[1:18:13] little bit in it you got to understand
[1:18:16] that you know there's certain there's
[1:18:18] certain portions of the Sheep music that
[1:18:22] that you've got to play exactly right
[1:18:25] now you can't give it personal
[1:18:32] interpretation now you can't come along
[1:18:34] and say well I don't agree with this
[1:18:36] part of it now no the music's got to be
[1:18:39] played all the way through
[1:18:41] and on and you've got to you've got to
[1:18:45] come to a place that that you realize
[1:18:48] that this is a
[1:18:50] masterpiece somebody much greater put it
[1:18:53] together so let me just say it like this
[1:18:56] if you were in the days of
[1:18:58] Beethoven you wasn't looking for his
[1:19:02] imperfections but he is known as the
[1:19:05] greatest writer that there's ever been
[1:19:08] as a matter of fact in those days if you
[1:19:10] read it much they actually even forgot
[1:19:13] some of the old they just had to let it
[1:19:15] go past because they had moved and I'm
[1:19:18] quoting words into a new dispensation of
[1:19:21] a greater
[1:19:23] writer Luther was great and Wesley was
[1:19:26] great and isua was great but we moved
[1:19:29] past we have much
[1:19:32] Advanced now we don't do away with that
[1:19:34] but we much
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:39] Advanced Now understand it quickly you
[1:19:43] you you you got to get it it's got to
[1:19:46] become part of
[1:19:48] you and there's certain quotes or
[1:19:51] certain scripts or certain pieces of the
[1:19:53] Sheep music
[1:19:55] that's difficult when you first start
[1:19:59] out come on but you just keep playing
[1:20:02] through it cuz you know when you arrive
[1:20:05] for the
[1:20:06] symphony you got to be able to play your
[1:20:12] part are you with me now whether you
[1:20:16] play the the little the little uh
[1:20:20] triangle whatever you do every part is a
[1:20:23] part that is so important everything's
[1:20:27] got to be right on
[1:20:32] tune now
[1:20:34] remember the director brother Brandon
[1:20:37] said has to get in the spirit of the
[1:20:41] composer now you know sometimes you come
[1:20:43] to church you come to a
[1:20:46] meeting and you maybe be expecting
[1:20:49] something much different than what you
[1:20:51] get but the Holy Ghost right is
[1:20:55] anointing your
[1:20:57] pastor and all of a sudden he's in your
[1:21:01] kitchen come on and maybe he's examining
[1:21:05] the fluk
[1:21:06] planing come on and he's trying to help
[1:21:10] you with the little beats of the
[1:21:12] music because this isn't a Sprint this
[1:21:15] is a
[1:21:19] journey life is not a steady picture
[1:21:22] it's a moving right and you're going to
[1:21:25] you're going to go from growth to
[1:21:27] maturity and there's things that you're
[1:21:30] going to catch as you go
[1:21:33] along are you with me now now remember
[1:21:37] there are some principles you got to
[1:21:39] understand nobody can take your
[1:21:43] place and you can't take nobody else's
[1:21:47] [Applause]
[1:21:48] place are you with me now
[1:21:52] so we would understand that in a
[1:21:55] symphony there's four major movements
[1:21:58] there's a movement of that's at first
[1:22:00] it's it's a quick movement and it's
[1:22:03] quick and it catches the audience and
[1:22:05] and it's just bouncy and it's just
[1:22:06] shouting and it's just praising the Lord
[1:22:09] and then it'll come to a different
[1:22:11] movement in the second movement to where
[1:22:13] it become more quiet and it'll begin to
[1:22:15] steady you and it'll it'll begin to tell
[1:22:18] a
[1:22:19] story and then it'll go in another
[1:22:21] movement and then other people of the
[1:22:23] orchestra will begin to play
[1:22:25] now at first everybody's playing but now
[1:22:29] maybe just half of them's playing and
[1:22:31] that guy with that
[1:22:32] stick yeah
[1:22:35] yeah he is standing there and he's so
[1:22:38] excited yeah as he so excited he's
[1:22:41] watching over this this group of people
[1:22:44] that have been gathered from all over
[1:22:46] the world they have been gathered there
[1:22:49] maybe they've had some auditions and
[1:22:52] maybe they've went through some practice
[1:22:55] but today they've got 10,000 people
[1:22:58] watching they pay good money The Whole
[1:23:02] World's
[1:23:04] watching this bride com to
[1:23:08] formation as a matter of fact Heaven is
[1:23:11] expecting you oh what a day it will be
[1:23:14] when you march into that
[1:23:17] land it'll be more than the vision of a
[1:23:20] bride marching all in her National Guard
[1:23:23] but we'll be marching in our new bodies
[1:23:26] singing Amazing Grace how sweet the
[1:23:29] sound that saved a wret like me angels
[1:23:33] will stand and watch you as you begin to
[1:23:35] walk in because you played the music
[1:23:46] well now let me just give you some

[1:28:17] at but that one fell and that one
[1:28:21] fell and that one walked away listen

[1:28:31] hurt get
[1:28:34] up God will never fail
[1:28:42] you when seated the orchestra is full of
[1:28:46] people that have
[1:28:49] problems it's full of people that have
[1:28:52] egos and want to be and want to be that
[1:28:56] but God brings us together and puts us
[1:28:58] in a certain
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:01] order our responsibility just just play
[1:29:04] the
[1:29:07] music prise
[1:29:15] God I'd like to say that this is a place
[1:29:18] that we could have a rock dropping party
[1:29:29] right you know Jesus had
[1:29:33] one yeah come on Jesus had a rock
[1:29:36] dropping party yeah and they brought a
[1:29:39] woman yeah to him that was caught in
[1:29:42] idolatry yeah because they were
[1:29:45] following Sheep music of another
[1:29:49] day and this woman should be stoned
[1:29:52] because she's been caught in a adultery
[1:29:55] right well they brought her they brought
[1:29:57] her to the right
[1:29:59] man
[1:30:01] yeah and he and he simply said that he
[1:30:05] that's without
[1:30:08] sin
[1:30:10] right cast the first
[1:30:14] stone and he began to ride on the
[1:30:18] ground and the woman was looking
[1:30:20] down and when Jesus was finished after a
[1:30:25] bit he could hear the Rocks
[1:30:30] dropping It's a Wonderful
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:34] sound could hear the Rocks
[1:30:37] dropping and they were dropping because
[1:30:40] no one was worthy to throw a
[1:30:45] stone now every one of us are guilty we
[1:30:48] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:30:49] glory of
[1:30:51] God none of us we hang our wings up in
[1:30:54] the back and we come into church all of
[1:30:56] us need more of
[1:30:58] God I think we could all say that all of
[1:31:02] us need more than God now sure we've
[1:31:05] probably got some pretend Angels or
[1:31:07] self-righteous people that's in the
[1:31:09] building but you just keep playing the
[1:31:11] music you're going to come to a rough
[1:31:15] spot it's called humble
[1:31:19] thyself short message but you just you
[1:31:21] just read it eat it and and it'll help
[1:31:24] you it'll bring the you into it
[1:31:29] that's it'll take your ego and crush it
[1:31:32] for a little
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:39] bit
[1:31:42] Hallelujah so so what we do is we come
[1:31:45] to church and you know the
[1:31:48] devil the devil can lock Donald Trump up
[1:31:55] and he can have all kind of Gossip
[1:31:57] magazines yeah and he can have all kind
[1:32:00] of targets beer
[1:32:03] joints and all kind of brothel and all
[1:32:06] kind of false
[1:32:08] churches but isn't an amazing one of his
[1:32:10] greatest
[1:32:13] tactics is to get people to fight one
[1:32:20] another that's that's because
[1:32:26] because that hurts when it comes from a
[1:32:29] brother or
[1:32:31] sister yeah I find it amazing that
[1:32:34] people can come and listen to an hour
[1:32:36] and a half sermon and not remember
[1:32:39] anything that was strategically
[1:32:40] important but they remember a
[1:32:49] blooper I spoke a sermon the other day
[1:32:52] at home and
[1:32:55] I used one of brother Tim's quotes I I
[1:32:57] thought it was
[1:32:59] incredible and I heard brother Tim say
[1:33:01] it a lot of times but maybe not from the
[1:33:03] pull pit but he would say sister Karen
[1:33:07] he said I wouldn't take a million
[1:33:08] dollars for her but I I wouldn't give
[1:33:11] you a nickel for another one just like
[1:33:20] her I made that statement about sister
[1:33:23] kany work good for brother Tim
[1:33:28] and before I got home nobody said what a
[1:33:32] good quote that you made and you was
[1:33:34] really in this portion but brother Ron
[1:33:37] would you call Sister Connie a
[1:33:48] nickel come
[1:33:52] on by back on back on
[1:33:58] Focus we hear
[1:34:00] Beethoven his
[1:34:02] music you might find it odd that I
[1:34:04] really do enjoy that kind of music I
[1:34:07] enjoy it kind of relaxing amen when I'm
[1:34:11] going through a a test on my brain or
[1:34:14] test on my lungs or whatever and I'm in
[1:34:16] those tubes for two and three hours I I
[1:34:19] enjoy those I enjoy music in my ears all
[1:34:23] right I don't want rock music in my
[1:34:28] ears but everybody can appreciate the
[1:34:32] masterpieces of his music yeah but they
[1:34:36] can't they have a lot of trouble looking
[1:34:38] at his
[1:34:40] life because his gift drove him
[1:34:44] crazy right and as it got further along
[1:34:47] the way he became he became a man so
[1:34:52] isolated and he became came deaf to
[1:34:55] where he couldn't hear his own music and
[1:34:58] that was his life being able to write
[1:35:01] music and and so instead of allowing the
[1:35:05] flaw to destroy
[1:35:09] him and never being able to write again
[1:35:13] he cut the piano legs
[1:35:16] off and he would play with his ear on
[1:35:20] the floor
[1:35:24] used to be he was able to go to the
[1:35:26] parties and enjoy company and hear the
[1:35:29] people tell him what a great music that
[1:35:32] you've done and here all of the
[1:35:34] musicians play their part and you're
[1:35:36] talking about a an
[1:35:38] individual that that listen to the key
[1:35:42] notes of when this one's supposed to
[1:35:44] play and when that one's supposed to
[1:35:46] play and when this one is supposed to
[1:35:48] did it come in just right and he enjoyed
[1:35:51] hearing his music come coming to
[1:35:55] life but it drove him into an isolated
[1:35:58] spot to where that now he couldn't sit
[1:36:02] in the
[1:36:04] auditorium but he would go behind the
[1:36:06] scenes and put his ear against the
[1:36:11] wood so he could feel the vibrations and
[1:36:14] hear the music being
[1:36:17] played and only then could he get proper
[1:36:21] satisfaction that his music was was
[1:36:24] coming to
[1:36:28] life
[1:36:30] scars
[1:36:32] difficulties he would never know how
[1:36:34] great of of a writer or composer that he
[1:36:39] was but it takes the right kind of a
[1:36:42] director that will catch that
[1:36:45] inspiration and not interpret
[1:36:48] it to make his own kingdom or
[1:36:55] yeah his own
[1:36:58] churchianity are you with me we've had
[1:37:01] another Master coming this
[1:37:03] age and we were told you're not feeding
[1:37:06] on the mind of a
[1:37:07] man but you're feeding on the body word
[1:37:10] of the son of
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:13] man are you with me that man wasn't to
[1:37:16] be worshiped like God but God lived on
[1:37:18] the inside of
[1:37:20] him and listen we as ministers and we as
[1:37:24] people we want to bring this message to
[1:37:27] [Applause]
[1:37:30] life and maybe it was just another song
[1:37:33] for a lot of places where he was
[1:37:34] preaching in Street Porter or in in Yuma
[1:37:37] Arizona or in Jeffersonville but it's
[1:37:40] our sheet
[1:37:42] music and maybe there's hundreds of
[1:37:45] thousands that listen to it and walked
[1:37:47] away and said it's nothing for me but we
[1:37:50] heard the
[1:37:52] word yeah
[1:37:54] we heard the word and it was our
[1:37:59] life this is more than just coming to
[1:38:03] church this is more than just sitting in
[1:38:06] a Pew this is more than just dressing
[1:38:09] the right way it's life pulsating
[1:38:13] through us and we're more than
[1:38:17] passionate about this
[1:38:19] [Applause]
[1:38:21] word amen
[1:38:23] amen amen it is said that Charleston
[1:38:27] hon when he played
[1:38:30] Moses he so studied the character of
[1:38:33] Moses until he began to become
[1:38:39] lost he lost his own
[1:38:42] identity
[1:38:43] yeah and after the Ten Commandments was
[1:38:47] played and now months after Charleston
[1:38:51] hon is off of the seen and nobody knows
[1:38:54] where he's at but he spend some time in
[1:38:57] a
[1:38:58] sanatorium wow to try to figure out who
[1:39:01] he
[1:39:05] was I pray tonight that we can so lose
[1:39:09] [Applause]
[1:39:11] ourselves yes sir amen it's not the
[1:39:14] great
[1:39:18] preacher not the great
[1:39:20] man it's the great God right
[1:39:25] amen and he spent time with the
[1:39:28] word to the point to like Paul could say
[1:39:33] I'm a
[1:39:34] prisoner you're talking about a
[1:39:36] compliment that he could say I'm a
[1:39:39] prisoner to Jesus
[1:39:45] Christ if you're looking hard enough
[1:39:47] you'll see the backdrop of a
[1:39:51] man I thank God that brother br
[1:39:54] told us about
[1:39:56] his
[1:40:00] shortcomings had it not been for the
[1:40:02] grace of God he would have killed five
[1:40:05] boys he'd have been a boxer he'd have
[1:40:07] been a
[1:40:08] bootlegger
[1:40:11] that's he may have taken a million
[1:40:13] dollars but God rich in
[1:40:17] Mercy why' you say that brother Ron
[1:40:19] because many of you have been offered
[1:40:21] different things in your life young
[1:40:23] people you'll be offered many things in
[1:40:25] your life to pull you off course but you
[1:40:29] keep your eyes on the sheet
[1:40:31] music You Keep Your Eyes On Jesus Christ
[1:40:35] that's right Humanity may let you down
[1:40:39] but you keep your eyes on Jesus he will
[1:40:42] never never never never never never
[1:40:44] never fail
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:50] you amen
[1:40:53] brother Tim and you as a boy sitting and
[1:40:56] on the wings of a snow white dove

[1:41:07] to be raised up in a home to which it'll
[1:41:09] be one of the first homes of royalty to
[1:41:12] where that the message would be read and
[1:41:16] and played there in your
[1:41:18] home you
[1:41:20] know there's no way that you're ad
[1:41:23] adversary could see where you'd be
[1:41:25] today that's
[1:41:27] right no way but there was places along
[1:41:30] the road he would have liked to made you
[1:41:33] offers he would have liked to made you
[1:41:36] offers Timothy the same thing brother
[1:41:38] Timothy the same thing made you offers
[1:41:41] brother Wayne he'd like to made you
[1:41:43] offers he'll make all of us offers that
[1:41:45] try to pull us off of
[1:41:48] course but we found ourself in Jesus
[1:41:54] there's a lot of things that we could
[1:41:56] have
[1:41:58] been but we surrendered oursel to
[1:42:03] God now God's no debor to no man sir

[1:42:43] it now you know if
[1:42:46] you're many times we have visitors come
[1:42:48] in maybe we have some
[1:42:50] today and when the symphony is playing
[1:42:53] it's if you don't understand the
[1:42:55] Junctions or the story that's going to
[1:42:57] be told it just sounds like a bunch of
[1:43:00] Racket
[1:43:01] yeah but for those that are interested
[1:43:05] that's
[1:43:06] right those that are
[1:43:09] playing and they come to their part and
[1:43:12] now they do their best at their part
[1:43:14] it's my time to say
[1:43:17] amen amen It's My Time to Say Amen it's
[1:43:21] my time to surrender my life it's my
[1:43:24] time this is what I'm living
[1:43:27] [Applause]
[1:43:30] for my cousin played in the National
[1:43:33] Symphony so I have some
[1:43:35] insight she played the flute about that
[1:43:38] instrument about that long and she
[1:43:40] played well that's about all the size
[1:43:43] instruments she could handle cuz she was
[1:43:45] 4 fo8 our family had a lot of height in
[1:43:50] it bless her heart she was a beautiful
[1:43:53] young girl and I had a difficult life
[1:43:56] and cancer took her and took her away
[1:44:00] and she was just incredible and I asked
[1:44:02] her one day we were we were together and
[1:44:04] I asked her I said what's the greatest
[1:44:07] moment of a symphony can I just talk to
[1:44:09] you just a moment she said you know we
[1:44:12] would get the the music that we're going
[1:44:13] to play at the next
[1:44:15] Arrangement and I would play it and I
[1:44:17] would play it and I would play it and I
[1:44:19] would play it I would play it until I
[1:44:21] could find no imperfection in it cuz I
[1:44:24] wanted to be exactly
[1:44:26] right she said but the greatest thing
[1:44:29] was once we were assembled and we took
[1:44:31] our spot we didn't know who was sitting
[1:44:33] beside of
[1:44:37] us all that was
[1:44:42] elected all that was elected they had
[1:44:45] gathered us we didn't gather them they
[1:44:47] had gathered
[1:44:49] us and and we had studied the music
[1:44:52] until it was just right right and you
[1:44:54] know it would come our time to play and
[1:44:55] we would play but as it gets toward the
[1:44:58] the end of it to where everything is
[1:45:00] just blowing up she said we could hear
[1:45:04] all of us playing at the same time and
[1:45:07] the atmosphere was so
[1:45:11] elevated on all of our hard
[1:45:17] work all the
[1:45:19] tolls we forgot all about the difficulty
[1:45:23] of
[1:45:24] life she she would stand there and she
[1:45:27] would just kind of go into another realm
[1:45:29] she said forget about my divorce and
[1:45:32] forget about the difficulties of things
[1:45:34] that I have to face on dayto day I just
[1:45:37] forget about fighting
[1:45:41] dancer when the music was playing and I
[1:45:44] could hear the music playing and I
[1:45:47] became absorbed in the music
[1:45:53] amen could we lose
[1:46:05] oursel now now
[1:46:08] remember you got to stay with the sheet
[1:46:12] music one day I was working
[1:46:15] and I was a chimney sweep long ago I
[1:46:19] don't know if you remember that but when
[1:46:21] I first came here in '94 before I was a
[1:46:23] chimney sweep yeah I went to a lot of
[1:46:26] homes I went to I went to Little Homes I
[1:46:29] went to
[1:46:30] mansions and sometimes I would I would
[1:46:33] kind of I'd kind of be a little bit
[1:46:35] judgmental about who I was working with
[1:46:37] and could they afford to pay me or
[1:46:41] not and I went to a home that was built
[1:46:43] in the
[1:46:44] 1700s the old guy
[1:46:47] was he had real straggly long hair had a
[1:46:51] dirty t-shirt on and had pants that was
[1:46:55] seemed to be falling off and they were
[1:46:57] just raggedy
[1:46:59] and and he had a lot of work to do and
[1:47:02] he's telling me what he wanted to do to
[1:47:03] restore restore the chimney and and to
[1:47:06] cover it and making it good
[1:47:09] and you know he said I want you to give
[1:47:11] me a bid on doing all of that I said
[1:47:13] okay but as as I was putting the bid
[1:47:16] together I I thought you
[1:47:20] know I don't know if this guy can afford
[1:47:22] it
[1:47:25] yeah and so you know I'm being honest
[1:47:29] not trying to be judgmental but at the
[1:47:31] end of the day I want to get
[1:47:32] paid right yeah yeah Mark you know how
[1:47:37] that is you work a week you want to get
[1:47:39] paid for a week and right and so I I
[1:47:43] asked him questions you know he began to
[1:47:45] talk to me how he was going to do the
[1:47:47] plaster and he was going to do all the
[1:47:49] work on the ceiling and how he was going
[1:47:51] to redo the lights and how he's going to
[1:47:53] do the brick work out front and he told
[1:47:55] me he said uh there's a walkway that's
[1:47:57] supposed to be here I'm going to put
[1:47:59] that walkway back and and uh I'm going
[1:48:02] to properly restore it like he said when
[1:48:05] you're done he said going grab all the
[1:48:07] contractors and bring them together and
[1:48:09] we're going to have a party on a certain
[1:48:11] day and show you what it looks like once
[1:48:13] it's fully
[1:48:16] restored and I said well I I'll be
[1:48:19] honest with you I got quite a bid here I
[1:48:20] said uh I I want I want to make sure to
[1:48:22] be paid for I said what do you do he
[1:48:25] said well I'm a
[1:48:28] restorer I said really he said yeah I'm
[1:48:31] a restorer I restore
[1:48:36] art he said you like to see it I said
[1:48:40] yeah he pulled an old curtain back and
[1:48:42] we walked into his Studio there and he
[1:48:46] had a piece of work that was sitting in
[1:48:50] front of me and I recognized the name at
[1:48:53] the bottom of it van go
[1:48:58] wow I couldn't say it well
[1:49:02] but there it was now he said this is

[1:57:12] brother but brother Ron that's
[1:57:17] listen I want you to preach me something
[1:57:19] spiritual I
[1:57:20] am come on right I don't know if you're
[1:57:24] getting it or not all we want to hear
[1:57:25] Seven Seals and seven Thunders I'm
[1:57:27] talking about
[1:57:34] you Amen Brother David iers came to our
[1:57:38] place and preach for us he's
[1:57:43] from
[1:57:45] Belgium and I get brain fog and so I
[1:57:49] have a lot of help so anyway
[1:57:53] I uh he had preached preached a
[1:57:56] masterpiece you know and after service
[1:57:58] we came home on a Sunday and and he was
[1:58:01] talking about he loved the
[1:58:03] saxophone I told him I was working
[1:58:06] working in this this thought vein and he
[1:58:09] says you know I've always played the
[1:58:12] saxophone he said but there's one
[1:58:14] saxophone I want to get it's a master
[1:58:17] builder in
[1:58:18] Belgium and what he's did is he's took
[1:58:21] from the scripture were that they took
[1:58:23] things of war and they made it for
[1:58:26] instruments of praise and
[1:58:29] worship and they melt down the brass and
[1:58:32] they take the wood and they take all of
[1:58:34] the pieces and now instead of being
[1:58:37] articles of
[1:58:41] War it becomes worship unto
[1:58:45] God and he said probably in my lifetime
[1:58:49] I'll never be able to afford such an
[1:58:51] instrument but he said it's a dream of
[1:58:55] mine well he told that to the right
[1:58:59] people because when he went home we gave
[1:59:03] him money to the dollar of what that
[1:59:06] thing was worth wow we had no idea but
[1:59:11] now that's not sitting in a
[1:59:13] shop and it's not a dream
[1:59:16] anymore or it's not a one day I want to
[1:59:19] be
[1:59:20] or if I can only hang to it but now he
[1:59:24] can play Amazing Grace how sweet the
[1:59:26] Sounder down from his glory ever living
[1:59:30] story and the music fills the
[1:59:35] room now no doubt the average person
[1:59:38] sitting in the building has no idea of
[1:59:41] the dream and the impossibility of that
[1:59:45] ever coming to past but they're sitting
[1:59:48] listen to the music
[1:59:53] the world don't know where you're at
[1:59:55] they don't hear the message like you
[1:59:57] hear it they don't set in Heavenly
[2:00:00] places like you said in Heavenly places
[2:00:02] but they just know that you don't
[2:00:05] cuss you don't tell dirty jokes on if
[2:00:09] there ever was a Christian you're the
[2:00:11] one maybe the only one in the school the
[2:00:14] only one on your job
[2:00:27] brother Ron sometimes I don't feel like
[2:00:29] my life is
[2:00:31] important
[2:00:33] really there was a girl that was talked
[2:00:35] about earlier and it's in my
[2:00:37] notes she laid nine years thought her
[2:00:41] life was
[2:00:43] hopeless but she didn't realize that her
[2:00:46] name would be synomous with some of the
[2:00:48] greatest Miracles that there would ever
[2:00:51] be
[2:00:53] and if you'll
[2:00:54] notice she was on her way when she was
[2:00:59] molested to piano
[2:01:03] lessons but when the miracle
[2:01:06] happened she didn't have to go to
[2:01:13] lessons she had laid there nine years
[2:01:16] and she' got a hold to some Sheep
[2:01:19] music and that Sheep music wasn't in
[2:01:21] inspired word to an inspired
[2:01:25] seat and it was what she was looking on
[2:01:28] it didn't matter all the unbelief that
[2:01:30] was around her that was trying to crush
[2:01:33] her dreams trying to crush her vision
[2:01:36] but that word was bringing it to
[2:01:41] life how could she ever get a prophet to
[2:01:45] come and pray for her let me just say
[2:01:47] this your
[2:01:49] impossibilities are very real with God
[2:01:57] I'm going home next week to baptize a
[2:02:03] man three months
[2:02:05] ago he was sitting in
[2:02:08] church as a matter of fact he had argued
[2:02:10] with his wife that was now coming to our
[2:02:13] church they would never want
[2:02:15] me tattoos have been a drunk since he
[2:02:19] was a boy wow had a very scarred
[2:02:24] life somewhere in that hotel room he
[2:02:28] decided Well I'll go with
[2:02:34] you and that night he found
[2:02:39] himself so inspired by what was being
[2:02:43] said it was more than a
[2:02:47] story it had more than historical value
[2:02:51] amen
[2:02:53] but he couldn't believe it as he was
[2:02:56] running to the
[2:03:01] Altar and the drugs was smelt on him and
[2:03:05] brothers that were praying for him felt
[2:03:06] like that they were getting
[2:03:09] high but God rich in
[2:03:15] [Applause]

[2:03:24] real to you yet if you ever meet him one
[2:03:28] time if he ever walks to your Pew one
[2:03:31] time and you invite him and say come to

[2:07:16] Lord thank you Lord
[2:07:22] thank you Lord you probably have heard
[2:07:24] this
[2:07:28] story but there was a great search in
[2:07:30] the early
[2:07:31] 1900s of who was the greatest singer on
[2:07:34] the
[2:07:39] earth and they came to the point to
[2:07:42] where that they didn't choose anybody in
[2:07:43] New
[2:07:45] York or in
[2:07:49] California but there was a man in
[2:07:55] Chicago there's a black
[2:07:59] man and nobody would want him in their
[2:08:02] Halls to
[2:08:07] sing so he felt
[2:08:11] rejected and he would
[2:08:13] walk miles to the Deep trash
[2:08:18] pits and he would go down in the trash
[2:08:20] pits and when he got to the bottom of it
[2:08:24] he would start opening
[2:08:28] up and he would sing and let his gift
[2:08:34] live and he would in those trash pits he
[2:08:37] could hear his voice echoing back to him
[2:08:41] and he was releasing his
[2:08:49] gift and he thought no body could hear
[2:08:54] him but you can't keep a
[2:08:59] secret and they knew if people knew that
[2:09:02] if he knew they were there he wouldn't
[2:09:06] sing right and as it would be there
[2:09:09] would be up to 10,000 people would
[2:09:12] gather on the other mounds of those
[2:09:14] trash pits to listen to the greatest
[2:09:20] voice and he didn't even know they were
[2:09:23] there
[2:09:26] wow as a matter of fact the story has
[2:09:28] said that to where
[2:09:30] that he went to his grave not knowing he
[2:09:34] had such a phenomenal
[2:09:47] audience I've just told a story about
[2:09:49] you that's right
[2:09:57] I just told a story about you

[2:10:23] story if that one didn't get to
[2:10:28] you and I promise you I'll
[2:10:32] quit David David had an incredible
[2:10:38] friend his name was
[2:10:41] Jonathan and he loved
[2:10:44] Jonathan they made bonds
[2:10:48] together it greatly grieved

[2:10:56] destroyed yeah David became a king to
[2:11:00] where that it was the richest king in

[2:11:23] out if one of Jonathan's family is still
[2:11:32] alive I'd like to bring them to my
[2:11:35] Palace I'd like for them to live not as
[2:11:38] a poper but as a king's
[2:11:42] child but he too had a
[2:11:45] story when the invasion was taking place

[2:11:50] yeah
[2:11:51] fell out of the window broke and
[2:11:54] crippled this

[2:18:50] that you're not a
[2:18:51] miracle I said you know I

[2:18:58] unbelief he said now Ron I want to tell
[2:19:01] you you've lasted longer than anybody
[2:19:05] else that we've ever had with brain

[2:21:06] music and it says to lay hands on the
[2:21:09] sick and they shall
[2:21:12] recover and all we know is we do what he
[2:21:16] says and it really doesn't matter the
[2:21:19] condition
