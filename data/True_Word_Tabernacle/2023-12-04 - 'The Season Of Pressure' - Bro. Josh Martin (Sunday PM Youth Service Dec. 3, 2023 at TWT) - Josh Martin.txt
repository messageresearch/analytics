brother Josh Martin with us amen tonight uh we we really thank a lot of brother Josh he's just like one of us uh him and sister Loretta of course she's one of our own we're just very proud amen of of what the Lord is doing in their life and their Ministry and appreciate their burden for the young people and everything they do how many uh how many of you appreciate Oklahoma Camp amen what a great

people praying for you pulling for you working for you it's just a blessed thing it shows that God's got something in store for your generation amen amen he's moving he's working and so so we just uh we just uh appreciate brother Josh we want you to take your Liberty whatever the Lord has in store we're just excited to hear it we'll sing that here amen this morning brother Wendell was preaching on Mighty Men amen Mighty women and uh made me think of a young man named Gideon in the Bible uh how that the angel greeted him came with a message to Gideon in a time when there really was a need for somebody to take up the mantle somebody to somebody to carry on what the forefathers had had left it's a it's a great story for young people each one of you in your own generation you're a Gideon you're somebody waiting for a call waiting for a purpose waiting for a uh waiting for an overcoming power and you know so a man appears to Gideon preaches him a sermon just like we heard this morning he says hail Gideon thou Mighty Man Mighty Man of Valor and you know what it is uh in our human Minds uh Gideon in his Humanity he starts to resist that he had a few things to say about it he said you're calling me a mighty man but I come from this kind of a household and we got these kind of problems going on and we're not seeing the power of God like it ought to be and all those things were true about amen but then all of a sudden there was a realization a revelation and he realized that that that man that was talking to him that was more than a man all of a sudden he realized that that was the angel of the Lord that had something to say to him we didn't hear from a man this morning amen we saw our brother Wendell take the pulpit but it was not a man it was the angel of the Lord that had a message to young people how many believe you got a message tonight amen he's how many want to receive it say God I don't want to argue with your calling I want to hear it I want to believe it I want to be that that mighty man I want to be that Mighty young woman amen that's anointed to overcome Le oosa amen we want to just answer his call let's stand tonight as we just welcome the Lord amen and let's receive let's believe what the angel has for us tonight oh Here I Am Lord oh here I am amen how many want to make a surrender open up to the leadership of the Holy Spirit tonight I give all myself to you oh Lord here I am oh Here I Am Lord speak to me oh here I am let your spirit speak to me let your spir speak to me here I am once again as we welcome brother Joshua oh here where I am [Music] I [Music] am yes Lord your spe can here I am amen is that your desire only the Lord can meet the needs touch the hearts speak speak to the storms in our life how many enjoy the sermon this morning the service this morning you know I was sitting there proud to call him my father call him my pastor you know I I'm think I might be a little biased but there is such love in my father that I I look at him and admire hope I can be that one day amen um if you have your Bibles let's turn to Matthew 4:1 such an honor to be here this evening appreciate the invite brother Wayne and brother Nathan to to minister the this youth service tonight um many of y'all know me that haven't heard me Minister I'm just a simple preacher but I pray something can be said tonight to be a blessing amen in Matthew 4:1 and it's a lengthy passage of scripture but we know this is right after John the Baptist or John the Baptist baptized Jesus and the spirit of God descends upon Him Matthew 4:1 then when Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he got fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and Seth him upon the Pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash their foot against a stone and Jesus answered Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not temp the Lord thy God again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me and then Jesus saith unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God in him only shalt thou serve amen can we bow our heads this afternoon dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to come into your pray presence Lord God as we felt you this morning and seen you walk the aisles and touch the hearts Lord God I believe you're the same yesterday today and forever father Lord I ask that you would move once again in the hearts of your people Lord walk the aisles father Lord we're a needy people father and only you can meet the needs Lord I ask these things in your precious name amen amen you may be seated and if I had a subject tonight it would be the season of pressure this is something I've been preaching on for the last few Services back home so I'm be putting a few different thoughts together so hopefully it can all all come together but I want to start off by reading a quote that is familiar to us all brother Brandon would say unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that a character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift and I just like how he puts that character as a victory not a gift that's not something we have to earn so to speak but it's something that's not just given to us we got to fight to obtain you know I think as a child we're giv clothes we're giv toys and it's not something that uh that we try to take care of because we didn't have to buy it oursel it was given to us so if we lose it we're going to get another one if we get hos in our jeans we're going to get some more jeans or if we lose our hat mama's going to buy us another hat but once we grow up and we start to pay for those things we're earning those things and now we're no longer willing to throw it away but we're going want to fight to obtain it you see and I think that's the way it is with the character of God if it's something that is just given to us every time we're in a Temptation every time we're in a struggle every time we're in a pressure we're willing to throw it away because we didn't uh we didn't fight for it but once it's a struggle to obtain it once it's a fight to obtain it you're not willing to throw it away and we're living in a time where the Satan is Satan is putting every gun every tactic everything he has have the young people of today but I believe there's something on the inside of the young people that we're not throwing it away but we're fighting to keep it oh my brother Brandon continues on to say a man without character can't rain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and so we can look at dictators throughout the span of the world Hitler Stalin melini Saddam Hussein all of these men had power but they had no character to use it and we see they turn into dictators and they did more harm than good and so God is wanting somebody on Earth that's not going to abuse the power that he's given them but somebody that can operate it under the character of his own likeness you see God wants somebody on Earth to manifest his life manifest his thoughts manifest his desires and without the character of God we're going to do what we want to do what I want to do what what my opinions are what my ideas are but once the character of God is on the inside it's no longer me I but now it's Christ we got one purpose that's the kingdom we got one agenda that's the kingdom and that's what God wants on Earth today is a bride that is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life power of his power oh my somebody has come under the character of God and is manifesting his life brother brandom continues on to say and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him so it's an overcoming process you see it's not just going through pressure it's overcoming the pressure it's not just going through suffering it's overcoming the suffering because we got many people that's been through this they've been through that they've been through this they've been done wrong but that did they overcome those situations it's not just going through hard times we got to overcome it you see because it can have the opposite effect pressure can either build up or it can destroy and the way and the way we respond to it determines our outcome in that pressure you see I believe pressure can build up such a faith in a young people that you can move mountains but the same pressure can destroy confidence where you don't know what is right you don't know what is wrong you don't know what to believe in so you got to resp respond the right way during the pressure and overcome the pressure and this is my favorite part about this quote brother brandom says thank you and brother brandom says this and the little temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes he's letting us know that the pressure we're going through the suffering we're going through is temporal but what we're going to gain from it is eternal oh that's why we can't give up in the pressure we can't give up in the hard times we can't give up in the suffering because we're living in a season of time but all of eternity is waiting for you oh that trial that you're going through is a season that the suffering you're going through is a season but all of eternity has been opened up to the young people of this generation that's why we got to fight we got to press this ain't time to lay down this ain't time to give up it's this is time to fight to obtain the character of God oh my this is time to fight you see the Bible lets us know that we got to press for it Revelations 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things he that overcometh so somebody it can't be pushed over by the devil but you got to fight for it you see the devil ain't just going to roll over and give you the victory but you got to fight for it you see the Bible would tell us in Luke 16 and 16 the law when the prophets were unto John since that time the kingdom of God has preached and every man presseth into it so anybody that's wanting to get into it has to fight for it has to press for it you see but pressure is incredible pressure can influence pressure can persuade pressure can intimidate so pressure can push you away from the things of God or to the things of God you see intimidation is a strong force you see how many I'm sure some's got their driver's license how many has ever been driving down the highway and you're in the fast lane and you're going too slow for the guy behind you what he's going to do is he's going to get behind you on your tail and he's trying to pressure you to get over even though you're doing what is right you're going the legal speed I'm ashamed to say but I'm one of those guys that likes the pressure you know to get over hey I'm I want to get where I'm going what I'm doing is I'm pressuring him I'm intimidating him trying to get him the move and oh my that's what the devil does with the young people of the day through pornography through lust through gossip through the spirits of the day he's trying to pressure you to move off of what God has given you in this generation oh we don't got to give into the voices of the world oh my brother Brandon preaches a message called the voice of God in these last days he talks about voices that are trying to dead in the voice of the supernatural trying to deaden the influence of the supernatural he the influence influence is a very important thing it can it can it can uh builds up your character the word influence means to mode character so you're either going to be characterized after God or after the things of the world you see brother brandom talks about politics he says politics has a voice and it's now crep into the church where the the the the voice of politics has a stronger pull than the voice of God and then he says he he talks about Hollywood he says Hollywood has a voice and now we look at the young people today he says uh except the pattern you say you you can look at somebody that comes out of Hollywood he says then watch everybody else start to dress like them start to comb their hair like them he says it's an influence it's a voice that is making people dress like that and so if the power of Hollywood has that kind of an influence what about the things of God oh what about the voice of God he can take a young people and turn them into a Powerhouse you see you might be a young girl or a young boy you might not be a preacher or a singer but you get under the influence of the voice of God it will turn you into one of those David's mighty men that brother W was talking about this morning but brother brandham talks about Hollywood and he says now it's become the pattern and that just stood out to me it's become the pattern it's become the the the the new normal and now we feel like the outcast we look at Hollywood and the people that are dressing like Hollywood and now we feel like we need to fit in with them even though we're living the right life your girls got your your L care and your long dresses you young men are dressing like gentlemen but now we're feeling the pressure to look like the pattern of the world oh my it's intimidation that is trying to get you to move off of what is right oh my but you see we don't got to give in to the pressure if you can just fight against the pressures of the day we won't look like Hollywood we won't look like the things of the world but we will look like Jesus Christ we will show the character and the life of Jesus Christ oh my you see brother brandom talks about Matt Dylan in that message he says Mount Dylan he was a bad guy he says he would wait outside of Dodge City and he would wait for the criminals to come out of the city and he would shoot him in the back he says he wasn't a good guy but now Hollywood has picked him up and made him into a made him into a good guy made him into a superhero and he says now the kids and this is back in the 60s I believe he says now the kids are wearing cowboy hats and are trying to mimic Matt Dylan he says that's all fine and all but now they know more they know more about Matt Dylan than they do about Jesus Christ what is it it's pressure that is trying to mow a generation and that is way back then but what about today we got spirits that are trying to promote a generation to look like the the the children of the world but you are an oddb you're not meant to fit in you're not meant to look like Hollywood you're not meant to look like the magazines you are meant to look like Ms Jesus Christ with the character of Jesus Christ on the inside you may say brother Josh you don't know what I'm going through I I'm only 25 I've been there I feel the pressures of the world that come against me I felt the pressures that I wanted to fit in I thought I was cool when I turned my hat on backwards and I went to the basketball court I did not look too very cool but I wanted to fit in I wanted to fit into society that pressure is a genuine thing but you got to fight against it you see the Bible would give us some examples that on the other side of the press is the victory you look at the Bible talks about the lame man but wanted to get to Jesus but he couldn't get to Jesus because of the press the Bible says the Bible says his friends pick picked up his bed and took him to the place where Jesus was preaching but he could not get inside because of the press and I thought my this is the kind of friends that I want to have those friends looked at that and said my the pressure is great we cannot get inside where Jesus is that but I'm willing to fight I'm willing to make a way so that we can get in front of Jesus Christ you know what they started to do they took off the shingles started to take the roof apart and lowered the lame man in front of Jesus so that he could see the victory oh my you don't want friends that are pressuring you away from Jesus I'm preach you now you don't want friends that has taken you away from the message of the hour you want friends when you're in the time of need when you're in the time of pressure when you're in a struggle they would say Hey brother let me pray with you I was reading a quote today let me show you this and encourage you and that should to give you an encouragement as as friends to stick up for one another in the time of pressure let me be one of those friends hey you don't got to go down defeated you don't got to backslide you don't got to turn away but let me take the shingles off let me take the roof apart so that you can get in front of the supernatural hey and I say this evening the shingles have been taken off the roof has been taken off the Supernatural is inside of the building if you've got a need Jesus Christ is walking the house touching the heart changing lives if you're willing to press for it you got to be willing to fight for it he's not just going to give up and give it to you you've got to fight for it you've got to press for it there's some agonizing that's got to take place oh Hallelujah the woman with the yeshu of blood the Bible says when she heard about Jesus she come to touch Jesus but the Press was too great she couldn't touch Jesus but she was willing to fight she was willing to crawl and let let let me tell you something sometimes you got to crawl past the pride you got to crawl past the self-esteem and the pride and the name that you built up for yourself so that you can touch the H of His Garment because once she touched the hym of His Garment the character of Christ started to reflect itself the characters of Christ started to reflect itself stuff you know brother brandom says that in the beginning before there was a sun before there was a moon it was just God he says inside of God was characteristics he had the characteristics to be a Healer to be a savior to be a deliverer but since he was God Alone there was nobody to express that to oh my so every time the god comes and heals your body that's the character of Christ reflecting in your body oh come on now every time God comes and gives you a renewing that's the character of Christ reflecting it itself to the world letting the world know that God ain't God alone anymore he's got a body on Earth come on somebody God wants a body on Earth that he can live through that he can reflect through you know brother brandom says that you're God's advertising agent you know he said that he says one time he was driving down the road and he SE a billboard and the billboard had one word hungry and he says that billboard wasn't to attract the ones that were looking for a call wasn't to attract the ones that were looking for a hotel it was to attract the ones that were hungry oh my and he says you're God's billboard you're to attract the ones that are hungry how has that taking place for the Josh the character of God is on the inside letting the world know there is the resurrected savior hey if there's never a time for the character of Christ to reflect itself it's today we got denomination after denomination claiming to be Christians claiming to know God but they're living a different life so if there's ever a time for a body to estain the pressure and reflect the character of God it is today oh my the Bible also tells us about zakus we sing about about zakus as a kid but I started to read these scriptures and this just stood out to me the Bible says he desired to see Jesus and who he was and that just stood out to me brother Nathan he didn't want to just see the body of Jesus he wanted to see who was on the inside he wanted to see who he really was because many people is seeing the body and calling him the elth many people is seeing the body and calling him the prince of the Devils many people is seeing the body I want to look past the body and see what is on the inside and little church everybody hear sermons we need to go past the sermons and see what is inside of the sermon hey there's many there's millions of people listening to the tapes but they cannot see the supernatural if you've got a desire to see Jesus and who he really is you can press you can fight past the pressure to see the supernatural you see the Bible says that he sought to see Jesus and who he was but could not because of the press because of the pressure was keeping him from seeing the supernatural you know what the Bible says he done though he knew where Jesus was going to go by and I just love that he knew where he was going to go and so what he did was he climbed up the tree brother the brandom says he got to the fork of the tree where the Old Testament and the New Testament come together and that put him in a position to see the supernatural oh my what I love about it is Jesus is walking by so now it's no longer zakus trying to see the supernatural now God is walking by his way so that he can see the super Supernatural he done fought he done pressed he done fought past all of the pressure now he is in position oh my and here comes Jesus walking by it ain't zakus saying Jesus and now it's Jesus saying zakus Oh my he done F past all the pressure he done fought past all of the pride he done fought past all of the the Skeptics and the naysayers and now it's Jesus walking down the aisle saying zakus come down from there for today I must abide oh and this evening you might have fought through some mind battles you might have fought through some pressures you might have fought through some pride to be here tonight but now you're in position you're in position Christ is walking the house calling your name calling out your need calling out saying I've got a miracle for you today if you want to see the supernal I'm walking by your way oh if you're willing to fight past the pressure you you can see the Supernatural and what's so incredible to me about this story is he says I must abide in your house the word abide is to take up residence to dwell permanently but Jesus left the house so did Jesus Li to him no he revealed to him what zakus was looking for remember zakus wasn't interested in the body he wanted to see who was on the inside of the body so whenever the body of Jesus left the revelation of Jesus was still there come on now the supernatural was still there because what happens the Bible tells us that zakus started to make all his wrongs right he started to repay the ones that he cheated what happened the supernatural was taking place and abiding in the house of zakus oh man you want to see change in your heart change in your home let the supernatural abide in the home abide in your heart and let us start making changes where you can forgive your neighbor where you can love your sister again where you can look at your parents without bitterness again hey I've been there before it's easy to become bitter it's easy to become offended at somebody but let the Supernatural come and abide in those situations let him come and he can for you can forgive once again like you used to you can love once again like you used to it's the supernatural coming and abiding but first somebody's got a press for it but you see the Bible would tell us in Philippians 3 and14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so there got to be some press SC and gone I'm going to move on from that now pressure could either destroy you or Build You Up the Bible would tell us in Matthew 5:10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake and so he's letting you know that you are a blessed generation when you're being persecuted for righteousness sake he's letting you know that the kingdom is yours if you can withstand the pressure you see one definition of righteousness is being right in the eyes of God including character and that just stood out to me blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake or for character sake for theirs is the kingdom and so whenever God starts to build a character in your life the devil's not going to just sit there and say yeah good job he's going to come back to try to Mar that character we can look at Joseph Joseph through his whole life was character building upon character whenever he W whenever he was thrown into the well that was some character building whenever he was sold as a slave that was some character building whenever he was in part ofer's house it was all building him and training him getting him ready for the kingdom but then you notice the devil wasn't going to give up on on Joseph the Bible says Piper's wife come up to Joseph and said come lie with me so now he's in a position of pressure he's in a position of pressure that if he would go and lie with parer's wife all of the character the God was building through his life could be marred hope this is okay this evening all of that character the God was working on through Joseph's Journey was now in a position to be marred oh my so that's H so the devil's not just going to give up when the when God is doing something in your life you got to withstand it and so now we see Joseph in a decision time he had to to stand against the pressure and the Bible says he refused her and he ran away but she got a hold of his coat and we all know what happened because he withstood the pressure now he thrown into the dungeon and I started to think about that he could not have got to the kingdom without going first to the dungeon cuz we know what happened that the was the Baker and the and the wine guy had dreams had had dreams and Joseph come and gave them the interpretation of the dreams if it wasn't for the dungeon how could if he got to the Palace come on somebody so now is in a point of pressure if he would have given in all of the character building would have been thrown away but now since he was stood it now he's in a position where he could fulfill the vision cuz you noticed before Joseph was ever in the palace there was a vision of Joseph him in a position of authority we all know the story how I think it was it was a wheek I believe Joseph was in the middle his wheat and his brothers were bowing down before him and the Stars the stars were bowing before Joseph's star so before Joseph was ever in a position of authority there was a vision of him in that position Oh but before he could fulfill that Vision he had to have some character oh Hallelujah and there's been a vision concerning your life Marching In step to Onward Christian Soldiers not like the world dancing and being drunk there's the vision for your life but you got to have some character it's not going to come easy you've got to press for it you got to fight for it you got to withstand the pressure oh my so now we see that Joseph is now on his way to the kingdom hope this is okay tonight he's on his way to the kingdom but it was I believe it was a year or so later but now Pharaoh has a vision and he asked his wise men what is I'm disturbed I'm troubled tell me my dream tell me the interpretation and they wented pharaoh to tell the dream and they was going to give the interpretation we all know the story and he says no you tell me the dream and give me the interpretation they could not do it and then there comes somebody hey Pharaoh I I was supposed to mentioned him before but I forgot it was right on time it was right on time if he would have told of Joseph way back then Pharaoh would have forgotten about Joseph too but this was the perfect time this was the perfect time for the baker to come up and say hey I had a dream one time too in the dungeon and there was a man in there that gave me the interpretation of the dream and Pharaoh says hey bring him up here if he would have given into to the pressure with Piper's wife he would have not been in the dungeon he would have been dead come on now but it took Piper's wife to get him in the dungeon hope you're following me now it takes the character building the pressures that put you in a position to fulfill the vision that God has for your life oh my so now Joseph is now in position we know the famine comes the drought comes and now the true test of his character is put into action forgiveness forgiveness what's he going to do when the ones that threw him into the dungeon on when the ones that solded him as a slave when the ones that told his father that he was eaten by Wolves now he's in a position for vengeance do you ever think about that now he's in a position he's got to snap his fingers hey go go go kill these guys and they would have done it he's in a position where the tables have now turned now he can bring the persecution but because of all the character all of the character building he's in a position and he forgives his brothers now think about that could you forgive somebody that throws you into a dungeon or throws you into a whale could you forgive your sister if she sells you as a slave man I know my my my my brothers were pretty mean to me pretty honoring but they never were that bad how I remember Caleb telling me I was adopted I wasn't loved but I never was sold as a slave that is a pretty rough situation but because of all of the character building all of the character building now he's in a position to express the love of Christ right now he's expressing the character of Christ in a position where human character could not have done it if he went straight from Daddy's house to the kingdom he would have not had that character to do that but s of all of the suffering all of the struggles all of the persecutions all of the heartaches that brought forth the character you might have been through some sufferings you might have been through some heartbreaks you might have been through some broken hearts but all of that is building up character it's Building Up character where you can fulfill the vision hey I hope it's okay if I tell a testimony there was a time where uh my heart was broken a million pieces my heart was shattered my life was a wreck and I was about to commit suicide I was I was sitting there at a swimming pool and I was about to jump into that pool and take my life but then a voice spoke to me and I said Lord if you would just take this from me if you would lift me up then I will serve you if you will lift me up I I would give all my days to you and because of that broken heart because of that Brokenness there was a fire that was put on the inside of my heart like never before it was Brokenness that put me in a position where the fire of God can manifest itself hey when your life as a teenager man I thought I was invincible hey I thought I could whoop anybody I could beat anybody and armrest and I was faster than anybody but there come a time where reality hit I I tore my rotator cuff I got a concussion and I realize hey I'm not big bad Bill oh no it takes the pressure it takes the suffering where you can't look up or you can't look down anymore because you're at the bottom of the bottom the only place you can look is up so it takes the suffering for you to realize hey if you how would you know that God could heal if you never was sick how would you know God could deliver if you never was bound how would we know God was a savior if we never was lost so it takes the suffering for you to realize I need something greater I need a savior I need a Healer and so don't curse God in the suffering but Rejoice that he counted you worthy enough to go through the sufferings like he went through he he went through Brokenness he went through hard times so that he would know what it was like for you to go go through those oh my oh my you see we're living in such a day of pressure you see but it's through the pressure that the devil is trying to Mark character you see when does something blow up it is when pressure upon pressure upon pressure and then all of a sudden it blows up nobody loses their temper right away oh I don't think you shouldn't at least but it's pressure upon pressure if something happens at the work and and this happens and the Brother brandham Talks he says you can step out onto the outside and you feel the pressure he says cars are flying by at 65 M an hour he says that the guy in the car is trying to hurry up and get home he hurry ups and he gets home but supper ain't ready because he's home too early and then the wife says something smart and then they get into a into an argument he says what is it it's pressure right it's pressure building upon building and it's building and then you explode and that's what the devil is trying to do is mar your character through pressure oh my but this ain't time to give up this ain't time to give in hey you know Jesus was in that very position you know when did Jesus ministry start after the Temptation in the wilderness that's right he never opened one blinded eye until after the Temptation he never raised one dead person until after the temptation but during the Temptation I'm sure it was hard I'm sure he was having mind battles just give in I don't know if you've ever had these thoughts but I've had these thoughts in the time of Temptation and pressure the devil will speak to me and say just give in and I'll leave you alone how many's ever heard that before just give in and I'll leave you alone I'll let up for a little bit could you imagine the thoughts that Jesus was having and just look at when when the devil says jump from the Pinnacle and the angels will catch you could you imagine how strong that Temptation was because the Bible says that the Angels come and minister to Jesus Jesus so the Angels was already there they was they were there the whole time could you imagine the the the temptation just to jump so that the devil would leave him alone but he withstood the pressure so that he could fulfill his ministry oh my you got to you got to withstand the pressure so that you can fulfill your ministry you may say brother the Josh I Don't Preach I don't sing but you got a minister we heard this morning I was sitting there listening to Dad preach and I was like oh man he's all over what I'm preaching preaching tonight but we all got to Ministry you don't got to sing you don't got to preach you don't got to play instruments but you got to Ministry but how the pressure how the pressure affects you determines your ministry you see little brother brandom talks about Suzanne Wesley he says she wasn't a preacher but she had 17 children but was still willing to pray for three hours a day and he says out of that come Charles and John Wesley her Ministry produced preachers oh oh my if we got some housewives in here your ministry your ministry can produce powerhouses your ministry can produce Hong leaders your ministry can produce Housewives and deacons and trustees you may say but the Josh I Don't Preach but you got a Ministry still you're raising the next generation of powerhouses hey what brother brandom say that there's going to be young men that take this message all the way to the coming of the Lord it could be your young men it could be your toddler sitting right there like like brother W said this morning there could be more Ray Ericson out here more Wayne lawon out here and the parents Ministry is is affecting how they're being raised hope this is okay tonight if your home life what you put before your children is affecting their way they're being raised but I say if we put the message of the hour before our children and that start to have influence their life and that's all they know then watch them become powerhouses it's a Ministry you see where the brandom talks about the little washwoman he says she wanted to do something for God we all know the story he she wanted to do something for God and so she was washing clothes and save the ball of her money and we brother brandom says she went and got some flyers Drew up some flyers and we're passing them out we're in the stable and on the flyer that there come a young man that come up to the to the woman brother brandom says he had hair down p his eyes his daddy's overalls on and he couldn't even read but brandom says he come up to her and says ma'am what's that say I can't read and she says son right over here is a Revival we're having some services in this little stable over here brother brandom says that night the preacher got up and started to preach and there wasn't even nobody there nobody was even there but he was preaching and I think my thank God for God called preachers for pastors for evangelists that are willing to stand against the pressures that are still willing to preach because while he was preaching brother brand says there come that little boy the one that couldn't read that had his daddy's overalls on haired down past his eyes come and set on the back row of the of that little stable and brother brandom says that as the preacher was preaching that little boy come up and gave his heart to Christ but the random says you know who that boy was the white El Moody that one two million SS to God and he says you know who was responsible for those two million Souls the little old washwoman the little old washwoman was responsible for those 2 million Souls why she had a Ministry it wasn't a great bright Ministry but she was willing to fulfill the ministry maybe you can sing that's a Ministry maybe you can testify that's a Ministry but pressure and complexes insecurities try to push down your ministry hey we heard this morning brother brandom says who is the first Divine healer David through his music so if you can play music that's a Ministry oh come on now oh how did God defeat the armies with Jehoshaphat remember the armies were coming against Jehoshaphat and the Lord come to Jehoshaphat and said the battle's not yours it's mine and you know what he told him to do you than the Lord would have told Jehoshaphat go get some Spears go get some armor go get some footmen but what he told him to do is go get some singers yeah go get some singers and as those singers begin to sing the anointing come down the supernatural begin to take place it wasn't preachers it was singers with the ministry come on now you might be able to get up and sing a song and shackles fall off that's a Ministry don't be ashamed of your ministry it's pressure that is trying to keep you down and away from your ministry oh my but you see uh just give me a few more minutes tonight but what I what I love about this what I love about Jesus and the Wilderness is the Bible says that the Angels come and minister to Jesus they come and minister in the brother Bram you know says he was tired he was weary it was 40 days that he was fasting and he was tired but in the the the hardest trial of his life the Angels come and minister to him and I thought my it was the same angels that were ministering to Elijah but the brandom dramatizes it and he says uh my servant is tired I want the angel with the softest of hands to go down and rub his brow M Massage his shoulders he was tired but then there come a ministering angel that started to bring comfort that started to bring peace it was Angels whenever Elisha was surrounded by the Syrian Army and Gesa I believe his servant walked out and said hey we're surrounded and he says no there's more with us than with him and he says Lord open this Poor Man's eyes and when his eyes come open he was angels He was ministering angels in the time of need and oh my little church there's a ministering angel
