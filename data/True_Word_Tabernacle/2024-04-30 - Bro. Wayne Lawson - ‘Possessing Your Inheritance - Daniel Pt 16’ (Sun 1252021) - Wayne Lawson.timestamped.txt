[3:27] name that's above every name amen and I
[3:30] want to say God bless you this morning
[3:31] certainly good to be in the house of the
[3:33] Lord and good to see everyone out this
[3:35] morning want to welcome all of our
[3:36] visitors God bless you and I know it's a
[3:39] special day today we're having baptism
[3:42] we've uh been having baptism after
[3:44] baptism of the spirit and the water uh
[3:47] it's been a it's been a real Revival
[3:50] around here for a while it seemed like a
[3:52] baptism every week and amen and we just
[3:55] want to thank God for that it's a it's a
[3:57] powerful thing to see the spirit of the
[3:58] Lord moving on the young people and uh
[4:01] and we've seen the water baptisms and
[4:03] we've seen the Holy Ghost baptisms and I
[4:06] think it was last fall or last year some
[4:08] point I think there was about nine young
[4:10] people received the Holy Ghost within
[4:11] about three three or four Services there
[4:13] consecutive one behind the other and
[4:15] it's a it's a powerful thing in this
[4:17] generation to see amen the wicked doing
[4:20] wickedly but the righteous they shall
[4:23] understand and be moved into the things
[4:25] of God Amen want to uh just this morning
[4:28] take a moment from the book of Daniel uh
[4:31] but I would like to if we could just to
[4:33] have a word of prayer before we approach
[4:36] the word we'd like to approach the
[4:38] author of the word and if you would with
[4:41] me this morning with your hearts bow
[4:43] let's just approach him a moment father
[4:45] it is such an honor to stand here today
[4:48] before your children and Lord we we see
[4:52] a great moving of the Holy Ghost among
[4:54] your
[4:55] church Lord your Prophet said that this
[4:58] revival would be so small that the
[5:01] Pentecostal world would miss it but it
[5:04] would be you Lord it would be you and
[5:07] the attribute of that former and latter
[5:09] rain being poured out to bring a a
[5:11] rapturing faith into the church and Lord
[5:14] we see it our eyes Lord have been opened
[5:17] to understand that it's you Lord and we
[5:20] ask you this morning may you give us of
[5:22] your mercy and your grace and Lord may
[5:24] you bless this meeting with your
[5:26] presence for truly Lord we understand
[5:29] that we are not worthy of your presence
[5:31] Lord we're not worthy to stand before
[5:33] your people we have Lord nothing that we
[5:36] have done that is good we just men but
[5:39] Lord while we stand under the power of
[5:41] this blood under the Redemption of your
[5:44] work Lord we confess our worthiness as
[5:48] we stand on your promises and we ask you
[5:50] this morning as we invite you to come
[5:53] Lord that you may move Lord not just up
[5:56] on a good will but to fulfill your word
[5:59] and your word is laying here as a
[6:01] promise before us Lord that every enemy
[6:03] would have to flee at the name and the
[6:06] mentioning of your name that healing
[6:08] would come and Lord the Holy Ghost
[6:10] baptisms would come and Redemption would
[6:13] come and Lord Joy would move and and we
[6:16] just invite you to come take your word
[6:18] take your Liberty Among Us Lord and as
[6:21] you move Lord we'll give you the right
[6:23] away and we ask you to bless it Lord in
[6:27] any good thing we'll give you all the
[6:28] glory and the honor
[6:30] in Jesus name we pray amen and amen and
[6:35] God bless you if you have your Bibles uh
[6:37] we'd like to return to the Book of
[6:39] Daniel and I'm want to look in the 11th
[6:41] chapter here and uh I know you're
[6:44] beginning to wonder if I know there's
[6:45] any other scriptures in the Bible but uh
[6:48] but I I I do I do Daniel 11 and want to
[6:52] read here from 32nd verse uh we're going
[6:55] to be moving from this on into uh that I
[6:59] I've been wanting to get to something
[7:00] for a little bit and we've been building
[7:02] into it so in Daniel 11 and 32 I want to
[7:06] read
[7:07] again and such as do wickedly against
[7:10] the Covenant shall be corrupt by
[7:12] flatteries but the people that do know
[7:15] their God shall be strong and do
[7:20] exploits uh we Thursday night reread the
[7:23] quote from Feast of trumpets brother
[7:25] Bram really uh says it a little
[7:29] differently the same way but brings
[7:31] understanding when he said the bride
[7:33] shall know her mate the revealed word so
[7:35] the people should know their God so he
[7:37] replaced people with bride brought it to
[7:39] you and then he said God and he
[7:42] explained that that is the revealed word
[7:44] in the age if you look in Daniel 12
[7:47] we'll read it here um you can read it in
[7:50] the ninth verse and he said go thy Way
[7:52] Daniel for the words are closed and
[7:54] sealed up to the time of the end of
[7:56] course this is also Revelations 10 but
[7:58] many shall be purified and made wide and
[8:01] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[8:03] and none of the wicked shall understand
[8:05] but the wise shall understand amen but
[8:08] the wise shall understand the spirit of
[8:10] wisdom released upon the church amen we
[8:13] ask the Lord to bless his word as you
[8:15] could be seated this morning and I want
[8:17] to uh just take for a few minutes today
[8:20] from this uh same thought the exploits
[8:22] of faith and I don't know what number it
[8:24] actually is uh I've switched in my
[8:26] personal notes to milk honey and Giants
[8:29] uh so I've been on that I've been on
[8:31] that in my personal study a little bit
[8:33] milk honey and Giants and some of you
[8:35] that wasn't here brother brma actually
[8:36] says that milk and milk and honey he
[8:38] said that's a Pentecostal cocktail amen
[8:41] for the church and and so uh I know
[8:43] there's milk and honey over there but
[8:45] then we found out the Giants were the
[8:46] bread amen you need something to spread
[8:49] some honey on and there's some bread
[8:51] over in that land and it was Giants amen
[8:53] for the for the calebs and and so uh we
[8:56] just want to take a few minutes this
[8:57] morning on the exploits of faith and um
[9:00] I I left you here Thursday night with a
[9:02] with a little bit of something we had
[9:04] found in the book of Ephesians uh when
[9:06] we were studying and showing how uh that
[9:09] of course Caleb and Joshua of the last
[9:11] day of Joshua being the end time
[9:14] messenger and the Caleb being the end
[9:17] time believer who fully followed the
[9:19] word of the Lord and Caleb was one who
[9:22] substained and he didn't faint uh but he
[9:25] went on and crossed into the Promised
[9:27] lands amen and having uh crossed into
[9:30] the land he was uh wanting his mountain
[9:33] and we found that that mountain was a
[9:35] mountain of promise it was something
[9:37] that God had promised him through Moses
[9:39] so he had a title deed to that promise
[9:42] it was the word of a prophet and as long
[9:44] as you have God's word on something
[9:46] you've got a right to stand on that word
[9:49] amen and dispute any other claim or
[9:52] anybody that's on it or anybody says you
[9:54] can't have it you got a right to dispute
[9:56] everything if you've got a prophet's
[9:58] word on it no matter what anyone else
[10:01] says you have a right to dispute what
[10:04] they're saying amen and this inheritance
[10:06] of course that was given to him by
[10:08] promise we found Caleb was a gentile and
[10:10] he come through the tribe of Judah which
[10:13] was a beautiful thought I believe
[10:14] because also did Tamar and or excuse me
[10:17] Ruth and Rahab also through the line of
[10:19] Judah and that's how they found their
[10:21] inheritance of course typing the Gentile
[10:24] bride who would find their inheritance
[10:26] in Christ through the tribe of Judah
[10:29] because of the great king amen the lion
[10:32] the tribe of Judah Christ it made a way
[10:35] for the Gentile Church to come into the
[10:37] atonements and the promises and and Paul
[10:39] trying to introduce this to the church
[10:41] in the book of Ephesians which is a book
[10:44] that parallels the Book of Joshua he
[10:46] said we have obtained an inheritance and
[10:48] amen I thought it was powerful we have
[10:50] obtained an inheritance he used the word
[10:52] we when he was speaking to the Gentile
[10:54] church so Paul and the Gentile church he
[10:57] was saying we amen I like that amen Paul
[11:00] didn't say I he said we amen that we
[11:02] have obtained an inheritance being
[11:05] predestinated according to the purpose
[11:08] of him who worketh all things after the
[11:10] counsel of his own will Ephesians 1:11
[11:14] this word inheritance in Ephesians 1:11
[11:16] is different than it's it's the same
[11:18] English word that's used in the rest of
[11:20] the book of Ephesians but the Greek word
[11:23] behind this word in inheritance is a
[11:25] little different because it talks about
[11:27] the casting of lots uh and of course
[11:30] this being the casting of lots and it
[11:32] takes you back to the Book of Joshua
[11:34] when Joshua moved into the promise that
[11:36] they divided an inheritance of course by
[11:38] lot and and this inheritance brother
[11:40] Rand has quite a bit to say about it and
[11:42] I think it's a powerful thing for the
[11:44] church to know what our inheritance is
[11:46] to understand our inheritance
[11:48] inheritance is something you didn't earn
[11:51] an inheritance is something that was
[11:52] given you and is given to you generally
[11:54] by parents of course the legal uh uh
[11:57] idea of inheritance actually speaks of
[12:00] parents and children it's actually an
[12:02] inheritance and and the prophet says an
[12:05] adoption book amen I thought it was a a
[12:07] good place to find it was in the
[12:09] adoption book he said brother Neville
[12:11] forgive me for taking time on this word
[12:13] inheritance he said but it's My Kinsman
[12:15] I hope I'm not crazy he said but an
[12:18] inheritance we have obtained an
[12:20] inheritance somebody has to leave you
[12:23] something he said see God before the
[12:25] foundation of the world left you
[12:27] something he left a name written on the
[12:30] Lamb's Book that when the lamb would be
[12:33] slain you'd be recognized with it amen
[12:36] God left you something and the greatest
[12:38] thing that he could leave you is your
[12:40] name on the Lamb's Book of Life there's
[12:43] nothing there's no greater inheritance
[12:45] in the world than your name on the
[12:48] Lamb's Book of Life you know your name
[12:50] being on the Lamb's Book of Life you you
[12:52] realize amen that sin canot be
[12:54] attributed to a name on the Lamb's Book
[12:56] of Life how many realizes that there's
[12:58] no place to write sin on the Lamb's Book
[13:01] of Life one of the greatest Revelations
[13:03] about the Lamb's Book of Life is it's
[13:05] only a list of names there's no there's
[13:08] no place to put an account of sin so a
[13:10] name left on the Lamb's Book of Life
[13:13] amen shows there's no place see it's
[13:15] just a place for a name you ever fill
[13:17] out something your name's a little too
[13:19] long and you run out of and there's no
[13:20] other place it's just that little place
[13:22] there there's nothing just that place
[13:24] and and God made a place just put it for
[13:26] the names that way amen that nothing
[13:28] could be added to the name because that
[13:30] was a name on the Lamb's Book of Life so
[13:34] the life that you're accounted for is
[13:36] the life of the Lamb it's not actually
[13:38] your natural life it's your spiritual
[13:40] life that come through the blood of
[13:42] Jesus Christ so there's not a better
[13:44] inheritance in the world than your name
[13:47] on the Lamb's Book of Life them people
[13:48] on the Lamb's Book of Life I'll tell you
[13:50] what a prophet said he said your name
[13:52] was put in there by the indelible ink of
[13:54] the blood and it can't be taken off I
[13:57] like that part amen I know some people
[13:59] people probably would remove my name if
[14:00] they could but thank God Amen they ain't
[14:03] got any access to that book this morning
[14:06] amen and if they did get access to it
[14:08] Amen brother R said it's put in the
[14:10] blood amen and they couldn't change it
[14:12] if they wanted to thank God this morning
[14:15] amen it's written in the Lamb's Book of
[14:17] Life amen where there cannot be anything
[14:20] accounted where it's written in the
[14:21] indelible ink how many knows that them
[14:23] in the Lamb's Book are those that which
[14:25] will go in the Rapture of the
[14:27] church absolutely this is separating
[14:30] time isn't it amen and the prophet reads
[14:32] it from Galatians the 4th chapter when
[14:35] he speaks about us being Heir amen I
[14:37] think it's powerful he speaks about us
[14:39] being Heir there's a great separation
[14:41] there uh galatian chapter 4 if you want
[14:43] to pull it up I think it's the 26 27th
[14:45] verse galatian chapter 4 speaking of of
[14:49] uh Abraham's uh two uh uh two sons it
[14:52] speaks of both of of Ishmael from Hagar
[14:55] and speaks of Isaac who come from Sarah
[14:58] and one brother random reads it he
[15:00] actually brings us into a message seed
[15:02] not air the shirt was you able to pull
[15:04] it up amen he said it's re written
[15:06] Rejoice thou baren that bearest not
[15:08] break forth and cry thou that travail us
[15:10] not for the children for the desolate
[15:12] have many more children than she which
[15:14] hath a husband and what's that next
[15:16] verse now we Brethren as Isaac are the
[15:18] children of Promise amen amen but as
[15:22] then that were born after the flesh
[15:23] persecuted him that was born after the
[15:25] spirit even so is it now Amen brother
[15:27] Bram as a few pre verses to it when he
[15:30] preaches it but in see not air with the
[15:32] shook he reads the scripture that deals
[15:35] with us being hirs to God but our Heir
[15:38] is through a promise just like Isaac was
[15:40] air we are air but we're air through a
[15:42] promise amen and then the prophet says
[15:45] see amen it's got to be separated Isaac
[15:48] and Ishmael was separated and so is the
[15:51] bride in the church it's got to be
[15:53] separated in the last day how many knows
[15:56] where the separation comes the prophet
[15:58] said here's the Separation The Bride
[16:00] will not be going through judgment
[16:02] according to John 5 and: 24 she has
[16:06] believed the word and bypass judgment by
[16:09] doing so amen but he said according to
[16:12] first Thessalonians 4 she'll be the
[16:14] rapturing church he said but over in
[16:16] Revelations 20 the Bible said the rest
[16:18] of the Dead lived not for a thousand
[16:20] years so there's a separating point
[16:23] between the seed and the hus or between
[16:25] the bride and the church you find it
[16:27] again in Matthew 25 when the Bible said
[16:29] there are five foolish virgin and there
[16:31] are five wise virgin there's a
[16:33] separating Point amen and that
[16:35] separation comes because of the
[16:38] predestination of God how many knows
[16:39] brother B said the foolish virgin wise
[16:42] virgin made out of the same material how
[16:43] many knows that it's the same exact
[16:45] material he said the only difference is
[16:47] the pattern was laid over that certain
[16:49] part and you fell within the pattern so
[16:52] your ordination is predestinated of god
[16:55] it's not what you earned amen I want you
[16:57] to realize this morning you you cannot
[16:59] earn your way into this Rapture it is an
[17:02] inheritance of God that is gave to the
[17:04] Church of the Living God well if you
[17:06] can't work your way in then you can't
[17:08] work your way out amen then the devil
[17:11] has lost the battle already this morning
[17:13] and there is a bride ready to go in and
[17:16] the devil can't do anything about it oh
[17:19] God that's shouting grounds this morning
[17:22] for the Church of the Living God we're a
[17:24] we're inheritors of the riches of God
[17:27] because our name
[17:29] was put on there our inheritance because
[17:31] of what because we were predestinated
[17:35] that's a prophet inheritance by
[17:37] predestination we my Armenian Brothers I
[17:40] know that's awful hard and I don't aim
[17:42] to hurt but it just does me so good to
[17:45] know it brother R wasn't fighting with
[17:46] the legalist he just wanted you to know
[17:48] it amen amen this is predestined you can
[17:51] relax a little I I don't mean this to to
[17:53] sound like we want you to go see but you
[17:55] got to quit letting the devil make you
[17:57] think amen that if you do a little
[17:59] something or you feel a certain way that
[18:01] you're all of a sudden somehow put out
[18:03] of the Rapture the devil don't have that
[18:05] kind of power over you Satan don't have
[18:07] that kind of power over the bride of
[18:10] Christ we have another origin we've got
[18:13] another order we have come here by the
[18:16] power of endless life hey when I think
[18:19] about this you say preacher I don't even
[18:22] believe in that predestination amen I
[18:24] know there's many that don't and some
[18:25] people don't even like the church age
[18:27] book because of that because brother bam
[18:29] uses the term elective love well I love
[18:32] the church age book because he uses the
[18:34] term elective love because I know I sure
[18:37] didn't earn no love but if it hadn't
[18:39] been for election where would I be this
[18:41] morning brother B said it's God's
[18:43] election Grace that called you it's
[18:45] God's election Grace that justified you
[18:47] it's God's election Grace if it was not
[18:50] for Grace where would we be this morning
[18:53] oh but the grace of God Amen that made a
[18:56] way where there was no way my grace of
[18:59] God predestinated Romans 8:29 and 30 the
[19:03] Bible said whom he did for know he did
[19:05] also
[19:06] predestinate and I I love that word
[19:09] predestinate I know some people don't
[19:11] like it much but I like it I think it's
[19:12] a rush I think it's a power within the
[19:14] church uh a Thrust would be the better
[19:18] word it's a it's a Thrust amen for the
[19:21] church in the bride time and the bride
[19:24] it's a it's a bride's experience with
[19:27] God and you can't explain it without
[19:29] using this word predestiny I met in
[19:32] Assemblies of God one time and I worked
[19:35] with him a while we we worked together
[19:36] every day and you know how it is you
[19:38] work with somebody every day and we was
[19:39] able to talk a lot during lunch and
[19:40] stuff and he was a Christian I was a
[19:41] Christian so we had a lot to talk about
[19:44] amen but him being an assembly God the
[19:45] first time I realized that some of the
[19:47] message people get their ideas on
[19:49] predestination from the Assemblies of
[19:51] God Amen I know some people were
[19:53] Pentecostal before they were message
[19:55] because when they explain predestination
[19:57] they say just like the Pentecostal say
[19:59] it and this Pentecostal man was talking
[20:01] to me about predestination he saidwell
[20:03] he said I I don't even believe in that
[20:04] predestination I said well do you
[20:06] believe your Bible he said yeah and he
[20:08] had a he had a Bible right here in his
[20:09] front pocket I just reached over and
[20:11] took the Bible out of his front pocket
[20:12] flipped it open to Romans 8 and read him
[20:15] he he did for no he also did predestiny
[20:18] and then I flipped it right over to

[21:02] grace of God the power of God every
[21:05] devil is defeated every one of them's
[21:07] already lost the battle amen somebody

[21:16] already got the word the grace of God
[21:18] has already reached our hearts what are
[21:21] you going to do with us now I tell you
[21:23] you can't do nothing with a man when he
[21:25] sees
[21:27] this can't do nothing with
[21:29] him he found out Satan cannot change in
[21:33] time what God done in eternity and if
[21:35] that ever strikes your heart you can war
[21:37] with Satan anywhere any place any time
[21:40] because you got it is
[21:42] written it is
[21:46] written glory amen inheritance was by
[21:50] predestination you inherit first brother
[21:53] Bram said inheritance was by
[21:55] predestination I inherited something
[21:57] there had to be something somebody to
[21:58] leave me in inheritance you say Jesus
[22:01] left me in inheritance brother R said
[22:03] beg your pardon he never left the
[22:05] inheritance Jesus never left you he only
[22:08] come and down and paid for your
[22:10] inheritance brought your inheritance but
[22:13] your name was on the Lamb's Book before
[22:15] the foundation of the world God give you
[22:17] an inheritance your inheritance was
[22:20] first he Oh Glory your inheritance was
[22:24] before the
[22:26] blood that's the reason Jesus died
[22:29] I love to read the Bible don't you and
[22:31] the Bible said he was slain before the
[22:33] foundations of the world why was he
[22:35] slain before because your name was
[22:37] written before before the devil young
[22:41] people I think amen you could take this
[22:43] and give the devil a good weapon this
[22:45] morning before there was a devil I had a
[22:47] name on the
[22:49] book before there was sickness or sin
[22:52] before there was a fall before there was
[22:54] a devil to cause a fall my name was
[22:57] already on the land Book of Life I was
[22:59] there in Victory I'm here in Victory but
[23:02] it was every bit of it was by the word
[23:04] of God for years I wondered how was my
[23:07] name written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[23:09] brother Seth I always wondered that one
[23:11] day I was reading brother brandom he's a
[23:12] powerful Prophet you know and he said
[23:15] this he said your name was written by
[23:17] the spoken word I said Oh Glory if it
[23:20] was written by the spoken word then I
[23:22] can read it by the spoken word I can
[23:25] hear it by the spoken word he do you see
[23:27] then you recog ize your name on the book
[23:29] by
[23:31] hearing if it's written by the spoken
[23:34] word you can read it by the spoken
[23:36] word if it was read if it was written in
[23:38] Spanish you could read it in Spanish but
[23:41] since it's written by the spoken word
[23:43] it'll take the spoken word to reveal
[23:46] it is that right since we're since we're
[23:49] this far along we might as well go ahead
[23:51] and say it he been there's been there's
[23:53] been millions of people whose names is
[23:55] on that book I believe it millions of
[23:58] people people redeemed whose name's on
[23:59] that book from the beginning all the way
[24:01] to now but brother Dallas this is the
[24:03] first age that people have knew their
[24:05] name was on that book in every other age
[24:08] it was a guess but according to the
[24:10] breach amen this is the age of the
[24:13] opening of the book and nobody has ever
[24:16] knew whose names were there until this
[24:19] season but here we are brother the book
[24:22] has been open the church has seen its
[24:25] name in the book than the greatest
[24:27] Revival and it ever struck the Earth or
[24:30] to strick our hearts amen I I just have
[24:32] to say it out there people don't like
[24:34] shouting I'm sorry you come to a
[24:36] shouting age he said well the bride used
[24:38] to not shout well they they shouted in
[24:40] the
[24:42] beginning you say this is a new kind of
[24:44] way I don't like this new movement in
[24:46] the bride list it's not a new religion
[24:49] it's actually the oldest religion there
[24:51] is the Bible said job was asked by God
[24:55] himself where were you when the sons of
[24:58] God was shouting for joy and the morning
[25:01] Stars sang together I wonder what kind
[25:03] of song they sang I don't think they
[25:06] sang and old funeral hymn I bet you they
[25:08] sang something that took the sons of God
[25:11] and lifted them off of their seats by
[25:14] the power of God I don't believe in just
[25:16] a bunch of funeral worship I believe the
[25:18] church is a place for life and power and
[25:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's time
[25:24] to throw out the formalism and the
[25:26] intellectual and let the power of God
[25:29] come into a church with Revival and
[25:32] truth and
[25:34] [Applause]
[25:36] life I wish I could hear one of them
[25:39] songs this morning I wish I wish God
[25:41] would have told us what songs they were
[25:43] singing but I feel like we I feel like
[25:45] we bump into one once in a while don't
[25:50] you brother Wayne's a little loud for me
[25:52] this morning brother Ram said this is
[25:54] the quietest place you're going to be
[25:58] hey amen you got to take it up with a
[26:00] prophet he said this was the quietest
[26:02] place if you go to hell they're going to
[26:04] be loud if you go to heaven it's going
[26:06] to be loud is that right amen it's just
[26:09] according which way you go but I'd right
[26:11] rather hear the Sons and Daughters of
[26:13] God rejoicing over the Vindicated word
[26:16] in the age and a bunch of people
[26:17] rejoicing and Shout over some ball game
[26:20] or some music thing amen but let the
[26:23] word of God be restored in the church
[26:26] until Victory can come into every heart
[26:29] into every
[26:30] life my I believe it God sent Jesus to
[26:34] save those that he had already
[26:38] chosen already chosen woo Glory my I
[26:44] feel so good I can't hard to
[26:46] read amen that's our inheritance God
[26:49] chose us and let Jesus come and pay the
[26:53] price the shedding of his blood that no
[26:57] sin would be be accounted to us nothing
[27:01] you
[27:03] do we better read that again get that
[27:06] and print somebody that no sin would be
[27:09] accounted to us nothing you do well
[27:12] we're not W to go out and do something
[27:14] wrong amen but we were born wrong to
[27:16] begin with and there's a lot of things
[27:19] back there that we're not proud of Amen
[27:21] but God is so M it that Satan cannot
[27:24] hold the past of the Bride to keep them
[27:27] out of the future of a home hey thank
[27:30] God this morning that he claims you he
[27:33] claims you with every problem he claims
[27:36] you with every trouble he cleaned you
[27:38] every bit of the issues you're going
[27:40] through but God cleansed you anyhow
[27:42] because he chose you and saw you before
[27:45] the foundation of the world you talk
[27:47] about lifting power you talk about
[27:49] lifting power this is astronaut fuel
[27:52] This Will Blast the church out into the
[27:55] bride's age with anointing and Power hey
[27:58] let Le de lose its
[28:01] gravity we got enough time to be weary
[28:04] we got enough time to be sad we got
[28:06] enough time to be serious why not let
[28:08] the Holy Ghost take us in a realm we can
[28:10] feel the joy of God we can wash till
[28:13] depression is broken and anxiety leaves
[28:16] the church I don't believe I don't
[28:18] believe we have to be a bound up bunch
[28:19] of people and sin and our history in our
[28:22] past and our trouble I think God has
[28:25] given Liberty when he said by a prophet
[28:27] it's can't be held against you it's not
[28:30] held against
[28:35] you I'm a Believer brother I believe it
[28:38] if a prophet said it I'll stake my life
[28:41] on
[28:42] it now if we preaching against hair
[28:45] women cutting hair or they they're high
[28:47] heels or something like if we preaching
[28:49] like that amen we got to believe a
[28:51] prophet we got to Humble to the prophet
[28:54] but if he switches gears and he comes in
[28:56] there and says that's your word works
[28:58] and God ain't held nothing we got to
[29:00] believe the prophet there the same as we
[29:02] believe him over
[29:08] here the shedding of the blood that no
[29:11] sin would be accounted to us nothing you
[29:14] do amen nothing see see what it was
[29:18] nothing you do he left me an inheritance

[29:24] inheritance amen I got to I got to skip
[29:26] down here and pick something up look
[29:28] what as a prophet was saying this he
[29:30] comes into this of how that Christ comes
[29:33] to the church he said listen he said he
[29:36] come and cut every obstacle from the
[29:39] human beings that they might be
[29:41] connected like in the Garden of Eden I
[29:44] was going to choke it but I'm going to
[29:46] say it man is omnipotent don't you
[29:48] believe that he is a man fully
[29:50] surrendered to God and do not does not
[29:54] it say in Mark 11 whatsoever things he
[29:56] should say now look what he's doing he
[29:58] comes in here and says every obstacle
[30:01] has been cut from Man by The Blood every
[30:04] obstacle I think it's powerful every
[30:07] obstacle what what what's he talking
[30:09] about every Obstacle of your past every
[30:12] Obstacle of your birth Every curse of
[30:14] your family every trouble anything that
[30:16] holds you out of the promises of God I I
[30:19] don't want you to forget now I'm talking
[30:21] about in the last day some people going
[30:22] to know their God they're going to know
[30:24] the revealed word and they're going to
[30:26] do exploits those exploit are actions
[30:29] this message is in action this morning
[30:32] with power and demonstration we don't
[30:35] believe in just the word only but we
[30:37] believe there's a Dynamics to this word
[30:40] that brings life and power what good is
[30:42] a dead L it'll kill every one of you but

[37:08] his blood was shed that I might go to my
[37:12] inheritance to be what he said
[37:15] inheritance to sunship to be a Son of
[37:20] God brother to an inheritance to be a
[37:25] Son of God to be a daughter of God God
[37:28] that's what you're predestinated to be I
[37:31] I I want to maybe sometimes I I'd like
[37:33] to just switch gears and preach another
[37:35] sermon I'm not going to do it to you
[37:36] this morning but I'll say this to you
[37:38] God never made a halfway
[37:40] son God never made a fallen son God
[37:43] never made a fallen daughter come on
[37:46] church amen God didn't make the
[37:48] caterpillar he made the
[37:52] butterfly you know I'm telling you the
[37:54] truth he made the finished work amen
[37:57] caterpillar is only on his way to a
[37:59] butterfly amen and you as the church
[38:01] redeemed is on your way to the fullness
[38:03] of adoption which is the changing of our
[38:06] body that's where we're going and no
[38:08] devil can keep us out of that but now we
[38:11] are the sons of God we're not going to
[38:14] be just in the Millennium we are already
[38:17] the sons of God we have an inheritance
[38:20] don't you let no curse rob you from that
[38:22] don't you let no devil rob you out of
[38:24] that well you can't be just now see what
[38:26] he's trying to is Satan trying to keep
[38:28] you out of it and I would if I was him
[38:31] because if this bride ever really sees
[38:32] who she is and what God has done for her
[38:36] Satan's had
[38:39] it now I I'll tell you what brother Ram
[38:41] says adoption part four if that's good
[38:43] for you it's good for me he said this
[38:45] may choke you to death he said but did
[38:48] you know that men that are sons of God
[38:50] are amateur
[38:52] Gods brother men that are sons of God
[38:56] are amateur Gods how many how ever know
[38:57] anything about that how many knows that
[38:59] Jesus said
[39:00] so how many knows Jesus said so he said
[39:04] you were an amateur God I'll read it to
[39:06] you brother bam is referring to the book
[39:08] in John 10:34 Jesus answered said is it
[39:11] not written in your law that you are
[39:13] gods and if he called them Gods unto
[39:15] whom the word of God came to and the
[39:18] scripture cannot be broken he said Jesus
[39:21] said is it not written in your law so
[39:23] Jesus said your Gods but he was quoting
[39:26] the scripture that said you were Gods he
[39:28] was quoting Psalms 82 and verse 6 I have
[39:31] said you are gods and all of you are the
[39:34] children of the most high I said you are
[39:37] God Psalm said it John said it now
[39:40] brother brandom in the end times picking
[39:42] it up and saying the same thing amen
[39:45] according to Genesis 1 when God created
[39:48] man he created man to have
[39:51] dominion is that right Dominion Dominion
[39:55] do he's given us Dominion that's why you
[39:58] are called a king and a
[40:00] priest and you have been given dominion
[40:03] and that Dominion is over sin over the
[40:06] Flesh and over the devil you are already
[40:10] in a Dominion with a king amen now that
[40:13] might choke you but it's the truth watch
[40:15] what brother bam says he said which God
[40:17] said in Genesis 2 that you were Gods had
[40:20] full dominion over the Dominion of the
[40:21] world he gave you dominion over all
[40:23] things he lost his godship he lost his
[40:26] sunship he lost his Dominion Satan took
[40:28] it over but brother we're waiting for
[40:31] the manifestation of sons who will come
[40:33] back and take it over again waiting for
[40:36] the fullness of time when the pyramid
[40:37] gets up to the top when sons of God are
[40:40] manifested in the power of God will walk

[40:57] you doing it come on if you were
[40:58] fighting over land in this world we're
[41:00] living you take it to the court that has
[41:03] judgment over that is that right and you
[41:05] don't take it with a gun you take it by
[41:07] the law and in the Church of the Living
[41:10] God brother R said the scripture is
[41:12] where we take the power away from the
[41:14] devil we bring him back to the word
[41:17] Jesus said it is written it is written
[41:20] and made Saint and Powerless before her
[41:23] and the Church of the Living God can
[41:25] take the word and go back and take Satan
[41:28] making him powerless with the church
[41:31] adoption four brother man said he's the
[41:33] logos that went out of God is that true
[41:36] that was a Son of God then he made man a
[41:38] little God and if he called them who's
[41:42] God who's the word of the Lord come to
[41:44] them are gods and God said to himself he
[41:46] were Gods I made you a God made Aaron
[41:49] your Prophet I may act like a religious
[41:51] crank but I'm not when your eyes come
[41:54] open and you begin to see these things
[41:57] he made man a god a God in his dominion
[42:01] and a domain goes from sea to Sea from
[42:03] Shore to Shore he has control of it and
[42:06] when Jesus came being the one God
[42:09] without sin he proved it when he said to
[42:12] the winds peace be still and to the tree
[42:15] he cursed it no man eat of you anymore
[42:18] then he turned I love it I love how
[42:21] Jesus ministered the Dominion into the
[42:24] church look at this Jesus exercised it
[42:27] when he spoke to the tree and cursed the
[42:29] tree didn't he brother R is saying it he
[42:31] said Adam lost it Jesus exercised it uh
[42:34] god without sin he showed peace be still
[42:38] curse the tree remember the Dead the
[42:40] lame the halt the blind everything he
[42:43] took power over it and showed the
[42:45] Dominion that he had in the spiritual
[42:48] world then he said unto them the minute
[42:50] they saw that Dominion he turned and
[42:52] said verily I say unto you well Glory
[42:57] verily I say unto you who's that
[43:00] you come on now I'll tell you what
[43:03] brother brandom says verily I say unto

[43:08] Gods verily I say unto you little Gods
[43:12] if you say under this mountain and be
[43:15] moved amen don't doubt it in your heart
[43:18] but believe what you said will come to
[43:20] pass and you will have it see that was
[43:22] the logos that come out of God when it
[43:24] become flesh how many realizes he says
[43:27] now now the same logos has a part he has
[43:29] got a bride that same logos the word
[43:32] that cannot be tampered with it's now
[43:34] brooding over the church today trying to
[43:36] bring it back the word to its full
[43:41] manifestation this word is not trying to
[43:44] make a scholar out of you it's trying to
[43:46] bring you into manifesting truth into
[43:49] manifesting Power amen the manifestation
[43:52] of the word that's what the whole world
[43:54] is looking for the sons of God to
[43:57] manifest the
[43:59] word I can read it to you Romans 8 you
[44:02] know the scripture says it the whole
[44:03] earth granth waiting for the
[44:06] manifestation of sons uh sometimes it
[44:09] helps you if you put a different word
[44:11] there as brother randomly use it use the
[44:14] word attribute if you can't take
[44:16] manifested son what about manifested
[44:18] attribute that's a good one didn't it he
[44:20] said then the bride was an attribute in
[44:22] the mind of God before and now and now
[44:25] they're being manifested so we are the
[44:27] manifested attributes of God well you
[44:30] you are the manifested sons of God
[44:33] manifested Sons this is what the whole
[44:36] world has been waiting on the
[44:38] manifestation of those Sons brother bam
[44:40] says it like this he says see he says
[44:42] now for the manifestation of the sons of
[44:44] God Amen I I I I like to to bring you
[44:48] sometimes where brother bam says
[44:49] something bring it straight out he said
[44:51] this is the day of the manifestation of
[44:53] sons of God when the Mysteries that
[44:57] that's been hid since the foundation of
[44:58] the world is to be made known this is
[45:02] the
[45:04] hour brother this is the hour adoption
[45:08] paragraph 80 go right back to Genesis to
[45:11] the original what is it now the world
[45:13] and nature is groaning crying
[45:15] everything's ready for moving of what
[45:18] for the manifestation of sons when true
[45:20] Sons born Sons filled
[45:24] Sons my that's that's three sermons
[45:26] isn't it amen when true Sons born Sons
[45:30] filled Sons speak and the word is backed
[45:34] I believe we're on the border of it
[45:36] right now say to this mountain amen now
[45:39] watch this we're talking about Caleb
[45:41] going into the lands of Promise here we
[45:44] show you strictly that the spoken word
[45:47] is a promise of the church and the only
[45:50] thing that will hold you out of it is
[45:52] the curse of sin that you hold in your
[45:55] own hearts the curce of sin you holding
[45:58] your own mind God has paid the price God
[46:02] has opened the Jordan God has sent
[46:04] leadership to take you in amen this
[46:07] morning the Bible said they did not go
[46:09] in because of unbelief but in our hearts
[46:12] this morning there's a reality that sin
[46:15] can no longer hold the church out of its
[46:19] position God has answered sin in this
[46:21] hour and here we are in such an hour and
[46:25] such a Time amen if you go to Romans the
[46:27] 8th chapter we'll read this Amen to take
[46:29] the scripture to back us a little bit
[46:31] here Romans the 8th chapter you can just
[46:33] read it I think it's a a powerful
[46:36] reading amen uh if we look here in the
[46:39] 14th verse for as many as are led by the
[46:43] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[46:46] for you have not received the spirit of
[46:49] bondage again to fear oh my amen what
[46:54] was Caleb dealing with back there they
[46:56] was dealing with with the fear of the
[46:58] Giants it wasn't the land wasn't theirs
[47:01] it wasn't that God had made a promise
[47:02] for the land that they themselves were
[47:05] under bondage and fear was their bondage
[47:09] think of this today we have not been
[47:11] given the spirit to fear this God has
[47:13] not given us a spirit to fear the
[47:16] Dominion and the power and the
[47:18] Redemption and the sons of God he's not
[47:20] given us the spirit to fear it how many
[47:22] knows where fear first come in the Bible
[47:24] it come in the Bible when Adam sinned
[47:26] the first time fears mentioned Adam see
[47:29] the next thing you know he's hiding from
[47:31] God and and and the only reason he's
[47:33] hiding is because of a fear from the sin
[47:36] he committed if there's no sin then
[47:38] there's no
[47:39] fear come on Church the Bible said
[47:42] perfect
[47:44] love casteth out fear and you cannot
[47:47] have perfect faith without having
[47:50] perfect love because as long as fear is
[47:53] there there is no perfect Faith but this
[47:56] is the age of the promise of perfect
[47:59] faith God has promised to the church not
[48:02] perfect faith in the Millennium yes we
[48:04] will have it in the Millennium but what
[48:06] do we need with it in the Millennium we
[48:09] need it now we need Miracles today we
[48:12] need Sons and Daughters of God today my
[48:15] goodness when I I think about this I
[48:18] think about the hour that we're living
[48:20] without this word what hope would we
[48:22] have in the face amen of inflation the
[48:25] face of all the distur distances and the
[48:27] troubles and the plagues and the
[48:28] sicknesses and the trials where would we
[48:30] be if this message hadn't give us this
[48:33] kind of
[48:35] Faith come on now we're talking about
[48:37] faith Beyond we're talking about faith
[48:39] Beyond just believing we're talking
[48:41] about something moving in from ability
[48:43] to God will he said preacher what are
[48:45] you saying can I give you an example in
[48:47] scripture amen it's Nehemiah right amen
[48:50] the three Hebrew children powerful
[48:52] Testament in scripture when they start
[48:53] going in the fiery furnace remember
[48:56] remember what happened the king says to
[48:57] them if you'll bow we won't put you in
[48:59] there and them Hebrew children said
[49:01] we're not careful to answer the Old King
[49:03] remember that we're not careful to
[49:04] answer the Old King and then what they
[49:06] said for our God is able to deliver us
[49:10] brother Bram said see the reason he said
[49:12] our God is able he said because there
[49:14] was no promise that he would he said but
[49:17] look how far they got with just knowing
[49:20] their God was able to do it he said but
[49:23] today we're not just standing here
[49:25] saying that God is able to do it we're
[49:28] standing on a promise of God that has
[49:31] been Vindicated in the age we're living
[49:33] in I'm not talking about something that
[49:35] has not been done but I'm talking about
[49:38] living in an age where a prophet has
[49:41] manifested the spoken word over the
[49:43] church to tell you that God by the blood
[49:47] has took the curse off that the church
[49:49] could speak by the power of the
[49:52] word brother brother brother brother I
[49:55] say like Caleb of oh give me this
[49:57] mountain give me the mountain of the
[50:00] Statue of a perfect man give me the
[50:03] mountain of true sons of God give me the
[50:06] mountain of the baptism of the Holy
[50:08] Ghost and the power of the spoken
[50:11] word oh I know I know I've done faced
[50:14] all the Giants in that
[50:16] land brother BR brother R was one did
[50:18] that you think you're brother Bram amen
[50:20] I I tell you what I challenge you on
[50:22] that statement right quick you said
[50:24] preacher what are you talking about I
[50:26] challenge you say brother Ram didn't do
[50:29] it tell me what man ever created
[50:32] anything I challenge you that Jesus
[50:35] Christ is not dead I say that he's alive
[50:38] and if there was any creating done it
[50:40] wasn't the man William brandom that did
[50:42] it it was God that did it through the
[50:44] channel of the blood and stepped into a
[50:47] mortal body and spoke
[50:50] it Oh Glory to God Brother s if he done
[50:54] it once He'll Do It Again
[50:57] amen if God did it one time he'll do it
[51:01] again every time I say something like
[51:03] that somebody say well brother Wayne are
[51:05] you creating squirrels and I tell them
[51:06] all the time well I'm not squirrel
[51:08] hunting I don't mean it to be arrogant
[51:10] but if they're going to be stupid might
[51:11] as well answer them you know amen it
[51:14] ain't nothing different than the man at
[51:15] the cross bring yourself down if you can
[51:18] save us Jesus wasn't trying to get down
[51:20] because the word had already said he
[51:22] would die and we're not trying to showbo
[51:25] for anybody we're trying to say there's
[51:27] a land of the power of the spoken word
[51:31] and it belongs to the Church of the
[51:33] Living God it's our
[51:36] land oh brother you ain't creating no
[51:39] squirrels well I'm not squirrel hunting
[51:40] either but I tell you what I am doing I
[51:43] am preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[51:45] and as an amateur God I have been told
[51:48] by a prophet that I could take the word
[51:50] and speak the word and it's the same as
[51:52] deity speaking and the creative power of
[51:56] the word word of God will move down into
[51:58] the church that's why sicknesses can be
[52:01] healed while you're preaching the gospel
[52:03] that's why lame can get up and
[52:10] walk oh we're on we're on squirrel
[52:12] hunting we're in
[52:16] church come on we might as well go ahead
[52:18] and say it haven't we you are a God how
[52:20] many knows that honestly you are a God
[52:24] if you're if you're not redeemed you're
[52:26] a fallen God if you're a redeemed you're
[52:29] a redeemed God put back where you come
[52:32] from is that right brother B said then
[52:35] you are a Creator an amateur one but
[52:37] you're a Creator and brother B said we
[52:40] have a power to create
[52:43] atmospher what a time to remind the
[52:46] church in a leoan world when everybody's
[52:49] mind is on houses and cars and work and
[52:52] now on Co and vaccines and all kinds of
[52:55] things out here in this world well I
[52:57] tell you here's one mind that refuses to
[53:00] let my mind stay on such nonsense all
[53:03] the time every day amen let this mind be
[53:06] in you I was also in Christ Jesus come
[53:09] on Church the prophet said it shall come
[53:12] to pass in the last days that you so
[53:15] think like the mind of Christ that he
[53:17] should bring to pass the thought of your
[53:20] mind can you imagine that you maybe
[53:23] sometimes won't even speak it but you'll
[53:25] be thinking it and the spirit of God
[53:27] will get a hold of your thought and
[53:29] creative anointing will come upon that
[53:32] thought and it will begin to manifest
[53:34] right among you you said preacher what
[53:36] are you saying I'm saying every one of
[53:37] you is a Creator right here every one of
[53:40] you is your creator I'll tell you what
[53:42] you got you got a power to open up your
[53:44] mouth and say Amen to the word of God
[53:46] you don't have to be a preacher to do it
[53:48] you don't have to be an elder to do it
[53:50] you can be a woman you can be a man a
[53:52] child every man and woman got a right to
[53:54] say Amen to the word of God and when you
[53:57] begin to amen the word it creates an
[53:59] anointing around the word and brings the
[54:03] power of what's being spoken back in
[54:05] your
[54:07] life come on now I got enough scripture
[54:10] stacked up here for a month to prove my
[54:11] point come on you know how to write only
[54:14] thing she did not rich not intelligent
[54:16] not understanding no money no class no
[54:19] Society no clicks no church nobody but a
[54:22] prophet sitting at the table
[54:25] woo and he looked at her and told her a
[54:28] story about creative power coming
[54:31] through human lips and she just put a
[54:33] little Amen in
[54:35] there come on mother come on mother you
[54:38] got a right to amen the same as anybody
[54:40] else got a right to amen the word and
[54:43] when she amened it brother Ram said a
[54:45] super anointing came in the building she
[54:48] created that
[54:51] anointing now there's not enough time to
[54:53] go there but you know what I'm talking
[54:54] about it was a creative anointing super
[54:56] anointing brother B said greater than
[54:58] when he spoke the squirrels is when he
[55:00] spoke back to her through her amen
[55:03] that's why amen sometimes that when you
[55:05] read oh God that's fresh off the gridle
[55:09] brother
[55:10] R sometimes you read a quote and when
[55:13] they read it back in the days in
[55:14] Jeffersonville it didn't cause a big
[55:17] Ruckus but you read that quote to this
[55:19] bride in this generation and with the
[55:22] understanding she has and it's got a
[55:24] greater anointing on it now that when
[55:27] the prophet spoke it back there he
[55:29] wasn't speaking it for that group he was
[55:31] speaking it for this end time church
[55:34] that's come to an anointing in the last
[55:36] day it's a greater anointing it's a
[55:39] greater work it's a greater time Glory
[55:42] we have come to the age you don't have
[55:44] to wait on it anymore it's your hour
[55:47] it's your season it's your day and when
[55:49] you begin to amen the word creative
[55:52] anointing enters into the building
[55:56] I'm not
[55:58] crazy I'm not crazy do you know the
[56:00] brother Ram said that you be electrified
[56:02] by his
[56:05] presence electrified that's powerful
[56:07] ain't it he said I am the vine and you
[56:09] are the branch he said every Branch will
[56:11] be energized from the vine he said every
[56:13] office of it will be electrified he said
[56:16] you'll be his mouth his ears his his
[56:18] nose his his feet he said it'll be God
[56:22] whether you're preaching the word or
[56:23] seeing a vision it'll still be God and
[56:26] the people will be electrified by the
[56:28] presence of
[56:32] God and the people shall be electrified
[56:36] by the presence of God have you ever
[56:37] been in a service that's just
[56:39] electrifying it's an electrifying
[56:42] presence a Prophet
[56:44] prophesied come on church he prophesied
[56:47] that when we repr preach the message of
[56:49] the hour it would Electrify the Church
[56:52] of the Living God sometimes you feel
[56:54] like you got a a vote of lightning
[56:56] running through your body somebody asked
[56:59] me one time said brother Wayne why do
[57:00] you get so excited I'll tell you why
[57:02] amen cuz sometimes when you're preaching
[57:03] the word it's more than just some
[57:05] scriptures going out there's a life
[57:07] going out of you there's a life going
[57:09] out of you I've been preaching and watch
[57:11] people begin theophan
[57:14] ising that's a good word ain't it I made
[57:17] it up amen it's the brother brother
[57:20] brandom said when you hear the word and
[57:22] recognize it you heard from your
[57:23] theophany right and then he says that
[57:26] glorified bodies right here in the
[57:27] building he said that amen and it's like
[57:29] a battery that's the positive and the
[57:31] negative so when you come the positive
[57:33] comes in contact with the negative as a
[57:35] charge of electricity that comes into
[57:39] the church preaching this message ought
[57:41] to be a charge of the anointing of the
[57:45] Holy Ghost with power and manifestation
[57:47] to
[57:51] Electrify all I say Brothers hook me up
[57:54] Glory let the the power come let the
[57:57] anointing flow let life changing
[58:00] experience coming to the
[58:03] church I had enough dead Services I want
[58:06] the power of God I want the reality of
[58:09] God to fall into the church with an
[58:11] anointing and with
[58:15] truth brother Wayne what are you talking
[58:16] about I'm I'm in the message

[58:21] boy was healed with cancer right in
[58:23] front of the right in front of the
[58:24] service there
[58:27] little boy healed with cancer leukemia
[58:28] exactly and he comes in there and says
[58:30] it took a creative work from God to
[58:33] change that blood cell and to cleanse
[58:35] that boy in the amount of hours the
[58:37] leukemia was gone he called it a
[58:39] creative work and you said preacher why
[58:41] would you say that I was over Norway a
[58:43] few years ago I was preaching this
[58:46] message he'll Billy me preaching the
[58:48] message of the hour just laying
[58:50] scripture on top of scripture and
[58:52] letting the anointing come and I said
[58:55] the seven star of the Book of
[58:56] Revelations there a man named William
[58:57] brandom an anointing fell in the
[58:59] building an electrifying anointing a
[59:02] woman in the back been sick with lukemia
[59:04] for years A year later come and hooked
[59:07] me up and said brother Lawson while you

[59:13] the top of my head went to the bottom of
[59:15] my feet I am completely healed of
[59:18] leukemia what was it it was a creative
[59:22] work it was a creative work come on if
[59:26] created back there amen when did God

[59:48] actually says it would would Electrify
[59:51] amen here's here's here's one part he
[59:53] says it like this and you I quoted that
[59:56] paragraph 183 the word became flesh in
[59:58] India he said a great wonderful church
[1:00:00] will go forth in the power of deity
[1:00:02] because deity will be revealed in human
[1:00:04] beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to
[1:00:06] pass the thought of their
[1:00:09] mind brother bam has a creative power
[1:00:13] who just healed uh leukemia you know
[1:00:15] what he says next the very next thing he
[1:00:17] says that one paragraph the next thing

[1:00:21] to speak it in his name I'm going to
[1:00:23] speak it in my revelation of Faith what
[1:00:25] happened in seeno Canyon the other day I
[1:00:27] believe the hour is approaching when
[1:00:29] missing limbs will be restored and the
[1:00:32] glorious power of the Creator I believe
[1:00:34] if he can make a squirrel
[1:00:38] appear a man or a woman has a missing
[1:00:40] part what about a complete
[1:00:45] animal said preacher are you putting out
[1:00:47] a challenge I'm not putting out a
[1:00:48] challenge I'm putting out a promise and
[1:00:50] I'm saying it's our land I'm saying it's
[1:00:53] our inheritance and I ain't going to let
[1:00:55] no long neck gick keep me out of it I'm
[1:00:58] not going to let no uncircumcised
[1:01:00] Philistine that has no Covenant with God
[1:01:04] say that it's not possible it is
[1:01:06] possible all things are possible with
[1:01:11] God I know I know people say a man a
[1:01:15] woman lost her nose for a surgery they
[1:01:16] asked brother Bram said brother Bram is
[1:01:18] it possible that her nose could be
[1:01:20] regrouped he said it's not only possible
[1:01:22] it's
[1:01:23] probable he said a few months later I
[1:01:26] saw the woman and her nose had been
[1:01:28] completely repaired God grew a new no
[1:01:31] listen to me friends I tell you there's
[1:01:33] still a God and he's still powerful and
[1:01:35] he's still real and in this Ley and age
[1:01:38] where they ground that every promise of
[1:01:39] God God still has a way to hook things
[1:01:42] up to bring electricity back into the
[1:01:45] lives of every believer I tell you this
[1:01:47] amen the god that created the first
[1:01:49] squrrel he's God that can do another
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:53] one he can do whatever he wants to he
[1:01:56] can create he can do anything the very
[1:01:58] God the creative life he says if you're
[1:02:01] a prisoner you can speak till it speaks
[1:02:03] and when you spoke it'll be God's
[1:02:06] word I'll skip down here the very God
[1:02:08] that made the Frog the first time the
[1:02:10] second frog he makes all frogs you see
[1:02:13] what I mean he made the first squirrel
[1:02:15] he makes the second squirrel he makes
[1:02:16] any squirrel he can make anything he
[1:02:18] wants to he is God he is God he is life
[1:02:21] and when I think of it it makes me
[1:02:23] shiver
[1:02:26] so what are you saying I'm saying the
[1:02:27] first God that made the squirrel in the
[1:02:30] beginning is the god that makes the
[1:02:32] second squirrel and the god that made
[1:02:34] your body is the same God that can add a
[1:02:37] limb back to your
[1:02:39] body come on some of you not amen not
[1:02:42] missing a hand this morning amen but
[1:02:44] some of you missing faith and that faith
[1:02:47] is what you need you need the hand of
[1:02:49] Faith to reach out and get a hold of the
[1:02:51] sword of God but just as God could
[1:02:54] create a natural Lim so can God create
[1:02:57] the hand of Faith he can put Faith back
[1:02:59] where there is no faith where your life
[1:03:02] has took Faith out of you let the word
[1:03:04] restore you this morning back to the
[1:03:07] faith of God to take the hand of Faith
[1:03:09] pick the sword up and go to fight long
[1:03:12] next again we not been put here to sit
[1:03:15] in our rocking chairs and watch things
[1:03:17] go by we're the children of God these
[1:03:20] are the promises of God and the whole
[1:03:22] world is waiting for you to move into
[1:03:25] your inheritance

[1:03:29] move brother Ram said Jesus was pointing
[1:03:31] at the Mount of
[1:03:34] Olives when you're a Son of God and you
[1:03:37] receive God which is zoee God's own life
[1:03:39] then you become a part of
[1:03:42] God we can stack a few of these quotes
[1:03:44] up can't we there's plenty of them you
[1:03:48] know that man could not move a mountain
[1:03:50] just by speaking to it the only thing
[1:03:52] that could do that would be deity if a
[1:03:54] mountain is before and our objective
[1:03:56] right our motive is right then it isn't
[1:03:58] us speaking anymore it's deity
[1:04:02] speaking then it has to
[1:04:05] move amen deity speaking you deity
[1:04:09] speaking the word comes into you if the
[1:04:11] holy spirit's in there it say alive as
[1:04:13] soon as it comes in therefore if you say
[1:04:15] to this mountain be moved don't doubt it
[1:04:17] in your heart because what you are deity
[1:04:20] speaking you believe that the Bible said
[1:04:22] so whatsoever thing shall come to pass

[1:08:13] to me enough of it
[1:08:16] already energized
[1:08:21] electrified I love that quote brother
[1:08:23] Ram says electrified cuz he actually
[1:08:25] makes another quote he said we're on the
[1:08:26] borderline I love how he uses borderline
[1:08:28] we're talking about Caleb we're on the
[1:08:29] borderline he said with the sons of God
[1:08:31] will speak the word and it'll flash like
[1:08:36] lightning you talk about a bunch of
[1:08:38] Thunder amen but I'll tell you it
[1:08:40] produces
[1:08:42] lightning I don't have time preach on
[1:08:44] this morning but there's a there's a
[1:08:46] scientific phrase I wish one of you guys
[1:08:47] would help me if you remember throw it
[1:08:48] out there but it's actually used for
[1:08:50] thunder and lightning it's actually a
[1:08:52] phrase used for thunder and lightning
[1:08:55] you don't have to see lightning amen if
[1:08:58] you hear the thunder lightning
[1:09:00] somewhere it's a it's a phrase I forget
[1:09:03] the phrase I've learned it from but it's
[1:09:04] a phrase an English phrase if you hear
[1:09:06] the thunder the Lightning's there if you
[1:09:09] see the lightning you don't even have to
[1:09:11] hear the thunder see it's thundering
[1:09:13] somewhere if there's
[1:09:15] lightning and if there's a thunder
[1:09:17] there's lightning god don't have thunder
[1:09:20] without
[1:09:21] lightning come on church he didn't
[1:09:24] release seven Thunders in this age
[1:09:26] without an electricity that would come
[1:09:28] back in the church but the Thunders
[1:09:30] revealed something it revealed that
[1:09:32] Christ was not in a tomb Christ is not
[1:09:35] in a Manger it revealed that Christ had
[1:09:37] descended into the Church of the Living
[1:09:39] God separated us from the church into
[1:09:43] the bride and now the bride becomes a
[1:09:45] tabernacle of the deity of almighty God
[1:09:49] my I think it's time I think it's time
[1:09:51] to cut
[1:09:53] loose I think it's time to cut loose
[1:09:55] from the fear and the spirit of bondage
[1:09:58] it's time to cut loose from all the
[1:10:00] Heritage and the curses and the
[1:10:02] doctrines and the ideas it's time just
[1:10:04] to cut loose of
[1:10:09] everything the power of this Blood you
[1:10:12] preachers preach it and we believe it
[1:10:13] all of us love it the power of the blood
[1:10:15] but there's something that something
[1:10:17] that that's that's so real to me
[1:10:19] personally to this is a personal reality
[1:10:22] is that the power of the blood before
[1:10:24] before the cross you know the power of
[1:10:26] the blood was that they took sins from
[1:10:28] the time of Adam all the way to Calvary
[1:10:31] and when the blood came all of that sin
[1:10:34] was erased Jesus did in three days what
[1:10:36] they couldn't do in millions of gallons
[1:10:38] of blood and ritual throughout the ages
[1:10:40] he erased and eradicated every evidence
[1:10:43] and power of sin to give the people a
[1:10:46] liberty is't that powerful amen so
[1:10:49] people say well amen that that's what
[1:10:51] the cross did but the cross is more
[1:10:53] powerful than that the blood has much
[1:10:56] more power than that because here we are
[1:10:59] 2,000 years after the
[1:11:02] cross and sins that were not even
[1:11:05] committed
[1:11:06] yet he eradicated them 2,000 years ago
[1:11:12] and reached into the future and said sin
[1:11:14] you're so defeated that you'll not be
[1:11:17] able to reach my children they'll be
[1:11:20] 2,000 years the other side of the Cross
[1:11:22] but Christ through the cross will have
[1:11:24] the power to eradicate every one of them
[1:11:28] amen now I I I I I think it goes real
[1:11:30] deep now you're easily going to receive
[1:11:33] the idea that when you got saved all
[1:11:35] your sin disappeared the day you got
[1:11:37] saved all your sin disappeared I was on
[1:11:39] this a little Thursday night all your
[1:11:41] sins disappear right but after the cross
[1:11:43] see that's where Satan gets you after
[1:11:45] you become a Christian after you become
[1:11:47] a committed person to God if you do
[1:11:49] anything if you say anything if you have
[1:11:51] any failure see there you blasphemed God
[1:11:54] see there you can't get no forgiveness
[1:11:55] see but what Satan fails to know is the
[1:11:58] power of that cross because the cross
[1:12:00] had the power to take all the sin before
[1:12:04] you become a Christian but it has the
[1:12:06] same power to take away all the sin as
[1:12:10] long as you're on this Earth God gave
[1:12:13] the blood to keep Satan from being able
[1:12:16] to get hold of
[1:12:19] you we could take it another level if
[1:12:21] you want to watch the watch the watch
[1:12:23] the Old Testament Saints when they come
[1:12:25] up and when Jesus comes he sets all the
[1:12:27] things straight Paul comes in teaches
[1:12:29] all the doctrine but then look at all
[1:12:30] the doctrine after Paul look at all the
[1:12:32] things they added after Paul preached
[1:12:35] look at all the things they added but
[1:12:37] when the message of the hour comes
[1:12:39] through the power of the blood it
[1:12:41] literally takes off of you every false
[1:12:43] doctrine that has ever been put on the
[1:12:45] church when you first came to the
[1:12:48] message come on church and then somebody
[1:12:51] got a hold of you and they started
[1:12:53] putting you this way and putting you
[1:12:54] that way and little things started being
[1:12:56] added to you but the same God that saved
[1:12:59] you is the same God that can take off
[1:13:02] every feeling every situation every
[1:13:05] trial every Doctrine anything any man
[1:13:08] ever
[1:13:10] said come on bride pick up your sword
[1:13:13] this morning and take off the head of
[1:13:16] anoch and his children and these Giants
[1:13:18] that have moved into this land long too
[1:13:21] long have we allowed Giants to possess
[1:13:24] blessings and promises that belongs to
[1:13:30] us brother Wayne what are you saying I'm
[1:13:33] saying it's time to cut loose Amen
[1:13:36] brother brandom says it like this amen a
[1:13:38] man who fully surrendered to God is
[1:13:42] omnipotent and Mark 11 says so next time
[1:13:44] you read Mark 11 where it says if you
[1:13:46] say unto this mountain be thou moved you
[1:13:48] read it the way he read it man is
[1:13:52] omnipotent isn't that something that's
[1:13:54] what brother brandom got from that
[1:13:55] scripture if you say under this mountain
[1:13:57] be moved man is omnipotent he is all
[1:14:00] powerful brother B said if man is
[1:14:03] omnipotent and God is omnipotent then
[1:14:06] you get them two
[1:14:07] together without any hindrances in
[1:14:12] there you get them two together without
[1:14:14] any hindrance of what this guy said and
[1:14:17] what this guy said and what this
[1:14:18] situation said and who did this and who
[1:14:20] did that and I did this and my dad did
[1:14:22] that and if you get all of that
[1:14:24] hindrance out of there and you connect
[1:14:27] an omnipotent man to an omnipotent god
[1:14:29] brother Adam said it like this then the
[1:14:31] atomic bomb is not the most powerful
[1:14:34] thing on the earth he said it's a
[1:14:36] Believer who's in contact with his
[1:14:39] maker no wonder Satan wants to keep
[1:14:42] something between you and the message or
[1:14:45] you and everything that God has anointed
[1:14:48] your life listen to me you are more
[1:14:50] powerful than an adom bomb
[1:14:55] can I say this to y'all this morning I
[1:14:57] think it's time to go off on the
[1:15:01] devil I think it's time to just blow up

[1:15:07] make it such a amen I I don't know how
[1:15:09] deep them bombs reach or how far out
[1:15:11] they go but I know you don't want to be
[1:15:13] close at all amen the repercussion from
[1:15:16] that thing is felt from miles and miles
[1:15:19] away and I think it's time amen that the
[1:15:22] devil don't want within a mile of your
[1:15:24] home he don't want in a mile of your
[1:15:26] church he don't want in a mile of your
[1:15:28] prayer life I think it's time to go off
