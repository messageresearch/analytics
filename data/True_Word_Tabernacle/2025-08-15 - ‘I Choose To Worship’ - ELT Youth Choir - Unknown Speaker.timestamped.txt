[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] When my heart is broken,
[0:16] when my life is empty, I can't see your
[0:20] face. I can't hear your voice.
[0:25] When I'm feeling helpless,
[0:28] wondering in the darkness, surrounded by
[0:31] fear and defeat,
[0:33] [Music]
[0:36] I have a choice to make.
[0:41] No matter what comes my way,
[0:45] I choose to worship.
[0:48] I choose to praise.
[0:51] I choose to lift up the name above all.
[0:57] I choose surrender.
[0:59] I choose to believe
[1:02] that you for all you will be.
[1:08] I choose to worship.
[1:11] [Music]
[1:15] Even in the fire,
[1:18] even in the valley, I can have joy and I
[1:24] can have peace.
[1:26] You are always with me and never will
[1:29] forsake me. Your presence is all that I
[1:34] need.
[1:37] And I have a choice to make.
[1:43] Heat. Heat.
[1:57] I surrender.
[2:00] I choose to believe
[2:03] for all that you and for all you will
[2:07] be.
[2:08] I choose to worship.
[2:15] And though we are pressed
[2:18] on every side,
[2:21] praise is our weapon. And we'll win this
[2:25] fight.
[2:26] We made our choice.
[2:31] [Music]
[2:39] Heat.
[2:41] Heat.
[2:44] [Applause]
[2:52] to believe
[2:55] that you are all you will be.
[3:00] We choose to sh
[3:19] and all you will be.
[3:22] We choose to worship.
[3:25] We choose to worship you, Lord. We
[3:28] choose to worship.
[3:30] We choose to worship.
[3:33] I choose to worship.
[3:39] [Music]
[3:41] [Applause]
[3:43] [Music]
