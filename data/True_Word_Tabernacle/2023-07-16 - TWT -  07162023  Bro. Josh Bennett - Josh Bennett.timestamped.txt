[49:39] I want to give a little testimony here
[49:43] for this couple
[49:48] the baby's name is Briella Grace
[49:52] and they actually had a
[49:54] first name
[49:56] another first name picked out
[50:00] but when Elizabeth
[50:02] was in labor
[50:04] she called out the name Briella
[50:08] and so that's how the name Briella came
[50:10] about
[50:12] I kind of was reminded of the Hebrew
[50:14] mothers
[50:16] isn't that right brother John the Hebrew
[50:19] mother's calling out that name
[50:21] and placing them in their position
[50:25] so I say to God be the glory
[50:29] you know
[50:31] we're just so blessed in this
[50:33] congregation with new generations
[50:38] and you know
[50:40] God knows every one of them
[50:43] and these parents are Holy Ghost parents
[50:48] these children that are born here and
[50:51] raised under
[50:53] such a lineage
[50:57] they have a great opportunity
[51:00] as they have become an age of
[51:02] accountability
[51:04] to serve the Lord Jesus with all their
[51:06] hearts
[51:07] if I could just have Briella
[51:17] let's pray together please
[51:19] father
[51:21] we put our hearts together as a
[51:24] congregation
[51:27] as we give this child back to you as you
[51:31] have given her to them
[51:34] you know better than all
[51:37] how to take care of her on her life's
[51:40] journey
[51:42] remember the prophet of God and things
[51:44] that are to be
[51:46] he's telling about how a child of God
[51:50] their life is all pre-planned
[51:54] and Father I remember even the prophet
[51:56] saying
[51:58] before the foundation of the world God
[52:00] knew our desire
[52:02] so Lord Briella Grace
[52:06] Briella means strength to bring forth I
[52:09] believe something like that
[52:12] God is my strength is that right I
[52:15] believe God is my strength
[52:17] so Lord we pray now
[52:19] that you keep her healthy
[52:22] that you'll help
[52:24] her parents
[52:26] give them leadership and direction
[52:29] and give them Grace to raise her in the
[52:32] fear and the admonition of the Lord

[54:13] love and I stopped in Tuesday night over
[54:15] by the carries and brother Nathan had
[54:18] held one of the youth meetings there and

[54:26] and they opened their home and and their
[54:29] you know what it is to have 40 young
[54:30] people in your house and and it just was
[54:34] overwhelming my I I every time I think
[54:37] about it I just weep
[54:39] to think that God has put it in the
[54:41] heart of people

[54:45] take time and efforts and and I thank
[54:47] the Lord for them amen and the grace and

[1:03:29] I tell you you're a blessed Church
[1:03:31] I have Brother Ray and brother Wayne
[1:03:34] also and to see what God is is doing
[1:03:37] here is just a real special thing I
[1:03:40] don't know if you know how special it is
[1:03:41] but it's not a very common thing but
[1:03:44] it's very precious and very special and
[1:03:47] to see uh two brothers that can work in
[1:03:51] Perfect Harmony and uh
[1:03:54] that just takes the Holy Spirit
[1:03:57] and uh it's a it's a special um
[1:04:00] it's um you know it takes men that are
[1:04:05] surrendered
[1:04:06] and yielded to God and so
[1:04:10] um real Dishonored to
[1:04:13] to be here and to be considered their
[1:04:17] friend and your friend
[1:04:19] but I wanted to give a quick testimony
[1:04:23] um and I hope you uh I hope you
[1:04:26] don't think that we're trying to be
[1:04:28] boastful in any kind of way because we
[1:04:30] certainly are not are not doing that but
[1:04:33] you know the Lord has blessed us and
[1:04:35] we've just built a church there at home
[1:04:36] and I know you're getting ready to build
[1:04:39] a church here and and so
[1:04:42] the Lord has blessed us and we just
[1:04:45] dedicated it last month and
[1:04:48] um
[1:04:49] just uh
[1:04:51] you know I look at it and I know that
[1:04:53] it's just God you know it just what God
[1:04:56] has done and
[1:04:57] but over the years there was uh the Lord
[1:05:01] laid upon our heart a couple times
[1:05:04] to help some Churches and specifically
[1:05:08] with their heating and air systems when
[1:05:11] they were either building a church or
[1:05:13] remodeling a church the Lord just laid
[1:05:16] it on our heart got a brother there in
[1:05:17] the church at home and that does that
[1:05:19] and he's able to get equipment and
[1:05:21] things and and so through that channel
[1:05:25] we were just Lord elated on our heart to
[1:05:28] to help a couple of churches with their
[1:05:32] and we bought and paid for their systems
[1:05:35] and and helped them in that way
[1:05:37] and I've never even shared this with my
[1:05:39] church but they don't even really know
[1:05:41] that we probably did that but but uh
[1:05:45] but we did
[1:05:49] but um
[1:05:51] and uh you know but the scripture says
[1:05:54] cast your bread on the water and and uh
[1:05:57] and and I'll just tell you how powerful
[1:05:59] the word is
[1:06:02] because when we got ready to build a
[1:06:04] church our church
[1:06:06] the Lord laid it upon the heart of a
[1:06:08] brother in this church
[1:06:11] my brother Hayden and um and he bought
[1:06:16] equipment for iron Heating and Air in
[1:06:19] our church
[1:06:21] and uh it was just a tremendous blessing
[1:06:25] and I don't know how to say thank you
[1:06:27] but I'll just try the best I can and say
[1:06:30] thank you
[1:06:31] from the bottom of my heart I we
[1:06:34] appreciate it and we know that it's just
[1:06:36] God and and I tell you you'll never out
[1:06:39] give God
[1:06:41] and whatever you do for God it'll be
[1:06:43] returned to you
[1:06:45] amen and I'll just say this I'm not um
[1:06:48] but you'll get back more than you gave
[1:06:51] amen and I'm a witness of that so we
[1:06:55] just so appreciate that this morning and
[1:06:57] so we'll just ask you to stand and we'll
[1:07:00] just go right into the word
[1:07:05] maybe we could just buy our heads and
[1:07:08] approach the author before we read
[1:07:11] Lord Jesus we just come before you and
[1:07:13] we thank you Lord for this great
[1:07:15] opportunity that you've given us this
[1:07:17] morning
[1:07:18] Lord here we are together with your
[1:07:20] people on the first day of the week in
[1:07:23] the honor of your Resurrection
[1:07:25] and Lord it's a great privilege
[1:07:28] and a great honor to be here

[1:07:34] Lord where you said where two or three
[1:07:37] are gathered together in my name there
[1:07:39] will I be in the midst
[1:07:41] and Lord
[1:07:42] we're certainly
[1:07:44] Lord in all of your presence and we know
[1:07:47] God that Lord where you are and we
[1:07:50] believe that you're here
[1:07:52] Lord because you promised to be here
[1:07:54] and Lord because of that Lord we have a
[1:07:58] great expectation
[1:08:00] Lord we realize God that all things are
[1:08:03] possible
[1:08:04] Lord I believe with all my heart that
[1:08:07] Lord if there be any sick among us this
[1:08:10] morning they can leave healed Lord if
[1:08:12] there's any oppressed they could leave
[1:08:14] delivered
[1:08:15] Lord because you are here
[1:08:18] and so God we give you preeminence in
[1:08:20] this service Lord we put you in the
[1:08:23] highest Place Lord we lift you up Lord
[1:08:25] as a supreme one Among Us God

[1:08:37] Lord you walk the aisles you Lord do the
[1:08:40] things that you want to do God the Lord

[1:08:50] For Your Glory in Jesus name amen
[1:08:54] amen amen Philippians chapter 2
[1:09:12] .
[1:09:13] and I'll read from verse 5.
[1:09:17] if it's okay I'm just gonna pick up from
[1:09:20] last night and continue on and
[1:09:22] a little
[1:09:24] I got some things in my heart this
[1:09:26] morning so you just
[1:09:29] bear with us
[1:09:31] let this mind be in you
[1:09:34] which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:09:37] being in the form of God
[1:09:39] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:09:41] God
[1:09:42] but made of himself of no reputation
[1:09:46] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:09:48] was made in the likeness of men
[1:09:51] and being found in fashion as a man
[1:09:54] he humbled himself
[1:09:57] and became obedient unto death
[1:10:00] even to death
[1:10:01] of the cross
[1:10:04] I'd like to read one verse again out of
[1:10:06] First Corinthians 2 and verse 16.
[1:10:11] or who hadn't known the mind of the Lord
[1:10:13] that he may instruct him
[1:10:15] but we have
[1:10:17] the mind of Christ amen aren't you
[1:10:20] thankful to this morning that you got
[1:10:22] the mind of Christ
[1:10:23] amen God bless you as your seated this
[1:10:25] morning
[1:10:33] you pray for me and I'll try not to
[1:10:37] repeat myself from last night too much
[1:10:39] but
[1:10:41] want to move into a little bit deeper
[1:10:43] into this this scripture this morning
[1:10:46] and you know as I as I went and as we
[1:10:49] looked at last night that brother Brown
[1:10:52] picked this up there in the unveiling of
[1:10:55] God and and uh he took the scripture and
[1:10:58] showed that the how that it was God and
[1:11:01] morphe and he was changing his form
[1:11:04] because the scripture says being in form
[1:11:06] of God so he thought it not robbery to
[1:11:09] be equal with God but then he took on
[1:11:11] the form of a servant so he was changing
[1:11:15] his form and I was just going to read a
[1:11:17] couple of quotes to build a little
[1:11:19] Foundation but they're in the questions
[1:11:22] and answers in 1964 he said and then God
[1:11:25] became material in a man called Jesus
[1:11:28] Christ which was his son and the son
[1:11:32] gave his life that he might bring other
[1:11:34] Sons
[1:11:35] that God might become tangible working
[1:11:39] in all and all that in that day you will
[1:11:42] know that I am in the Father the father
[1:11:44] in me I knew and you and me and brother
[1:11:48] around says Oh Brother that'll be a real
[1:11:49] day amen you won't have to join or drive
[1:11:52] or go from Birmingham to hear the
[1:11:55] message the message will be right with
[1:11:57] us then see amen amen that'll be a how
[1:12:01] many knows that the prophet took that
[1:12:03] scripture and says at that day ye shall
[1:12:05] know he said what day that day is this
[1:12:07] day
[1:12:08] amen so you're living in the day that
[1:12:10] you shall know these things and amen and
[1:12:13] there again in the in the invisible
[1:12:15] Union
[1:12:16] of the bride of Christ the prophet said
[1:12:18] the life that was in the grain or is in
[1:12:21] the grain again what is it just exactly
[1:12:23] like the same grain that went in the
[1:12:26] ground the same Jesus now this is a
[1:12:28] powerful statement the same Jesus in
[1:12:31] Bride form
[1:12:33] amen the same power same church same
[1:12:35] thing same word so now uh he's he's
[1:12:39] remember it's God amorpha he's changing
[1:12:42] his mask or changing his form amen he as
[1:12:47] we looked at last night he appeared unto
[1:12:49] them in another form so amen it was the
[1:12:53] same God but in a different form amen
[1:12:56] and that's what you got to realize this
[1:12:58] morning that amen that you got to
[1:13:00] recognize God Amen in whatever form that
[1:13:04] he's in is that right amen and how many
[1:13:07] believes he's here in the form of the
[1:13:09] word he's he's here in the Holy Spirit
[1:13:11] this morning amen but he's also
[1:13:13] according to the prophet he's here in
[1:13:15] Bride form so even the same God Amen and
[1:13:18] morphe has changed his mask again amen
[1:13:22] changed his form again so there in the
[1:13:24] unveiling of God he said God changed
[1:13:26] himself he changes his form if you
[1:13:28] notice here in Philippians he said not
[1:13:30] thing not thinking it robbery see but he
[1:13:32] took the full form of a man see that
[1:13:36] word morphe means amen the form by which
[1:13:39] a person or a thing strikes the vision
[1:13:41] amen is the external appearance so amen
[1:13:45] and now the prophet said he come down
[1:13:47] see the Greek word means something that
[1:13:49] could not be seen yet it's there and
[1:13:52] it's changed and the eye can catch it
[1:13:54] even so amen the invisible God is going
[1:13:58] to change his form amen into something
[1:14:01] that you can see is that right he said
[1:14:03] like Elijah they're at Dothan C the
[1:14:06] servant couldn't see all them angels
[1:14:08] that was around there God just changed
[1:14:09] amen not brought the Angels down amen
[1:14:13] but he changed the seeing of the
[1:14:15] servancy amen there was a mountain full
[1:14:17] of angels and fire and Horses of fire
[1:14:19] Chariots of Fire all around the prophet
[1:14:21] amen see and they change he changed the
[1:14:24] scene the thing was already there
[1:14:28] amen so that's what I'm trying to say
[1:14:30] the god that always was is here
[1:14:33] hallelujah how many believes it this
[1:14:35] morning the god that always was is here
[1:14:38] amen God is in this building
[1:14:41] amen Christ is here
[1:14:44] oh my and who's this melchized I know
[1:14:47] you know these quotes but he said it's
[1:14:48] like television even there's another
[1:14:50] dimension even television people are
[1:14:53] moving right through this room right now
[1:14:54] singing There's colors also but the eyes
[1:14:57] only subject see the five senses your
[1:14:59] whole being is subject to the five
[1:15:01] senses amen and you are only subject to
[1:15:03] what sight has been limited to see but
[1:15:06] there's another dimension that can be
[1:15:08] seen by transformation amen by
[1:15:11] television and our television does not
[1:15:13] manufacture a picture it only channels
[1:15:16] it into a circuit and then the
[1:15:18] television screen picks it up but the
[1:15:20] picture is there to begin with
[1:15:21] television was here when Adam was here
[1:15:23] television was here when Elijah said on
[1:15:26] Mount Carmel television was here when
[1:15:28] Jesus of Nazareth walked the shores of
[1:15:30] Galilee but you're just now discovering
[1:15:32] it see they wouldn't have believed it
[1:15:34] back there you've been crazy to have
[1:15:36] said something like that but now it's
[1:15:39] become a reality and so it is that
[1:15:42] Christ is here the angels of God are
[1:15:44] here here and someday in the great
[1:15:46] Millennium to come it'll be more real
[1:15:48] than television or anything else because
[1:15:49] they are here amen and he reveals
[1:15:53] himself in the great form of what he
[1:15:55] claimed as he amorphies himself into his
[1:15:57] servant and proves himself amen now here
[1:16:02] he is in the form of the spirit and then
[1:16:05] he comes in the form now amen that he
[1:16:07] appeared to Abraham now catch this
[1:16:09] because brother Brown is showing you how
[1:16:11] he come amen from the word to flesh is
[1:16:14] that right amen remember God and morphe
[1:16:16] he's he's changing his mask and what
[1:16:18] that brother around saying amen he just
[1:16:20] took a a handful of dust and he and blew
[1:16:23] himself a body and he's God stepped into
[1:16:26] that body appeared to Abraham is that
[1:16:28] right and Abraham saw God in flesh
[1:16:32] is that right amen the same God Amen
[1:16:35] revealing himself to Abraham Amen in
[1:16:38] flesh now amen amen and what did he do
[1:16:41] when he was there amen he began to
[1:16:43] reveal the secrets of the heart amen but
[1:16:47] it was God it was God Amen it veiled in
[1:16:50] a flesh body amen and listen he didn't
[1:16:53] lose amen any of his deity
[1:16:56] when he took on the form of Flesh he
[1:16:59] still remained God
[1:17:02] hallelujah amen and then amen that was
[1:17:06] in the beginning of the Bible in the
[1:17:07] Book of Genesis amen but then Amen in
[1:17:09] the middle of the Bible here he comes
[1:17:11] amen and God takes a a creates a blood
[1:17:15] cell the prophecy and wraps himself in
[1:17:17] it amen this time he didn't take a
[1:17:20] handful of dust and and blow a body and
[1:17:22] step into that body even but now for the
[1:17:24] purpose of redemption
[1:17:27] hallelujah amen because he had to be a
[1:17:30] kinsman redeemer hey but he had to be
[1:17:32] born of a woman is that right amen
[1:17:35] Elizabeth God could not redeem you as a
[1:17:37] logos God could not redeem you as
[1:17:40] eternal spirit God could not redeem you
[1:17:42] as a pillar of fire he had to become
[1:17:45] flesh he had to be a kinsman redeemer
[1:17:48] amen he had to be born of a woman so God
[1:17:51] created a blood cell and wrapped himself
[1:17:54] in it
[1:17:55] what a powerful revelation
[1:17:58] amen and God Amen became a man see they
[1:18:02] had the whole thing mixed up even
[1:18:04] because the Bible says that they looked
[1:18:06] at Jesus amen and they and and and the
[1:18:09] trouble that they had with him is they
[1:18:11] thought it was a man trying to make
[1:18:13] himself God but Jesus was not a man
[1:18:16] trying to make himself God it was God
[1:18:19] that had made himself a man
[1:18:21] hallelujah amen that's the Revelation
[1:18:24] and I tell you this he was no less God
[1:18:27] Amen in the man Christ Jesus even then
[1:18:30] he was in heaven
[1:18:32] Hallelujah and by that blood and the
[1:18:36] redeeming work of that blood in this day
[1:18:38] I hope y'all can take it amen God took a
[1:18:41] man born just like you and born just
[1:18:44] like me Hallelujah this time it was not
[1:18:47] a sinless amen a virgin birth even but
[1:18:50] he took a man Hallelujah I was born in
[1:18:53] sin but hadrid had been redeemed by the
[1:18:56] power of the blood of Calvary and God
[1:18:59] stepped into flesh
[1:19:03] Hallelujah and he borrowed a body
[1:19:08] and spoke their lips
[1:19:13] hallelujah amen and he was no less God
[1:19:16] Amen in William random than he was
[1:19:20] when he met Abraham
[1:19:23] glory amen and he ain't no less God in
[1:19:26] you
[1:19:28] well I know they tell you you're you're
[1:19:30] taking something don't belong to you
[1:19:32] even they're trying to tell you you're
[1:19:34] robbing from God Amen Saint John 14 12 8
[1:19:37] for you it was only for the prophet amen
[1:19:40] these things these even the power of God
[1:19:42] Amen ain't for you is only for amen it's
[1:19:45] just for the prophet it's just for the
[1:19:47] ministry it was just for the apostles
[1:19:49] amen but I tell you it's a lie it's a
[1:19:52] devil's lie it is not robbery
[1:19:56] Hallelujah you are not taking something
[1:19:59] that don't belong to you it's a promise
[1:20:02] and I challenge you this morning reach
[1:20:05] out and take it
[1:20:07] late claims to it
[1:20:09] Hallelujah
[1:20:12] let this mind
[1:20:14] be in you
[1:20:16] that was in Christ Jesus
[1:20:23] being in the form of God
[1:20:25] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:20:27] God
[1:20:28] but watch this in verse because I'm
[1:20:30] gonna
[1:20:32] now
[1:20:34] you're just gonna have to stay with me
[1:20:35] for a few minutes because
[1:20:38] but Jesus
[1:20:40] is going to reveal to you
[1:20:44] what deity looks like in humanity
[1:20:49] how it would talk
[1:20:52] how it would walk how it would live
[1:20:55] everybody I understand
[1:20:58] he made of himself
[1:21:00] no reputation
[1:21:03] he took on the form of a servant
[1:21:06] was made in the likeness of men
[1:21:09] he humbled himself
[1:21:12] brother Brown said in Jesus Christ the
[1:21:14] same yesterday today and forever he said
[1:21:16] remember God don't have enough stuffed
[1:21:18] out shirts
[1:21:20] when you get the place that you're
[1:21:21] willing to be nothing
[1:21:23] then God can make something out of you
[1:21:26] as long as you're trying to be big and a
[1:21:28] lot of Flowery advertisement and all
[1:21:29] this stuff's going on in my opinion
[1:21:31] Something's Happened see Jesus went
[1:21:33] along doing good going to the poor and
[1:21:35] the needy he never made a himself a
[1:21:37] reputation did you ever think of that he
[1:21:40] made of himself no reputation the man
[1:21:41] that made the artificial tooth made a
[1:21:44] reputation for himself but the one that
[1:21:45] made the real tooth never made a
[1:21:48] reputation the man that made the
[1:21:50] artificial arm amen made a reputation
[1:21:52] for himself but the man who made the
[1:21:53] real arm made of himself no reputation
[1:21:56] the Way Up Is Down I always remember
[1:21:59] that be humble be sweet
[1:22:02] be kind and then Brethren says be
[1:22:05] creative
[1:22:08] it almost don't seem like that that fits
[1:22:11] in that statement but he said be humble
[1:22:14] be sweet be kind be creative
[1:22:17] let Christ be in you and then he goes
[1:22:20] straight in this thought he said did you
[1:22:22] ever see people that you love to be
[1:22:24] around you just love them to be around
[1:22:26] them because they create an atmosphere
[1:22:30] amen a Heavenly and you just like to be
[1:22:33] around them then there's others they're
[1:22:34] good people but you know I I just you
[1:22:37] gotta I have to get away once in a while
[1:22:39] I'm so glad brother Graham said this
[1:22:44] because you know you feel that way and
[1:22:47] it makes you feel good that a prophet
[1:22:48] felt that way too
[1:22:50] he said you know what I mean and yet
[1:22:52] they seem to be good people it's not
[1:22:54] creative
[1:22:56] he said but but you a man was made to be
[1:22:59] a god
[1:23:02] we know that Genesis 1 26 he had a
[1:23:04] dominion over the Earth he was made to
[1:23:07] be an amateur God and when when he
[1:23:09] receives God he becomes a Son of God
[1:23:11] again he was made in the image of God
[1:23:13] God had hands God had feet so there's
[1:23:15] therefore a man is made like him so he
[1:23:18] is an amateur God he said but sin has
[1:23:21] blinded every fiber in his body in his
[1:23:23] mind and his heart you were made to have
[1:23:26] dominion
[1:23:27] you are made an amateur God we created
[1:23:30] Power
[1:23:33] sometimes we think about these things we
[1:23:34] got an idea of what that means but
[1:23:36] listen where the Prophet said amen
[1:23:38] listen I'll tell you a good place for us
[1:23:40] to start create an atmosphere
[1:23:44] you say what don't brother don't you
[1:23:45] believe we're gonna take the world over
[1:23:47] one day don't you believe that we're
[1:23:48] going back to Eden we're going to take
[1:23:49] the Earth back where I do but friends I
[1:23:52] want to tell you we're never going to
[1:23:53] ruin Reign on this Earth until we ruin
[1:23:55] Reign this Earth
[1:23:58] we gotta get to a place that amen we can
[1:24:01] amen take control amen of our
[1:24:04] surroundings of the atmosphere
[1:24:10] created Power laying in a man
[1:24:13] see but it comes in humility
[1:24:15] brother Ben said humble that in the
[1:24:17] message humble thyself you know people
[1:24:19] want Power
[1:24:21] but they don't really know what power is
[1:24:22] they don't really know amen what goes
[1:24:26] with it the Way Up Is Down always if you
[1:24:29] want piracy how humble you can get just
[1:24:32] get away from all the worldly thinking
[1:24:33] and humble yourself before God and then
[1:24:35] you got more power than the man that
[1:24:37] runs all over the building and makes a
[1:24:39] big lot of noise because you've been
[1:24:41] able to conquer yourself
[1:24:44] and commit yourself to Christ see to
[1:24:47] humble yourself before him that's really
[1:24:49] power you show me a church that's humble
[1:24:52] a real humble not an arrogancy a church
[1:24:55] that's just sweet and humble and I'll
[1:24:57] show you a church that has favor and the
[1:24:59] power of God in it that's right it
[1:25:02] that's the thing it takes humility
[1:25:03] humbling ourselves before God Amen
[1:25:06] letting God just work through us
[1:25:09] and I want to say something right here
[1:25:12] and listen friends I'm not here to try

[1:26:04] amen and I tell you what that that is a
[1:26:07] result amen of a Ministry that will
[1:26:10] preach the word because the word is what

[1:26:20] pastor amen you got amen you got Brother
[1:26:23] Ray you got now brother Wayne and these
[1:26:25] brothers have lifted up the word

[1:26:31] sometimes we think oh a great church
[1:26:33] would be amen you know the biggest group
[1:26:35] or or they'd have this or they'd have
[1:26:38] their whatever you might even imagine
[1:26:40] amen the greatest Church would be amen

[1:26:56] happens amen if we're not careful we'll

[1:27:03] Ministry or or it's the gift an
[1:27:05] appropriate or or it's the Bill Norris
[1:27:07] this or it's that he may not tell you
[1:27:09] this if we ever lose sight of this amen
[1:27:11] that it's not about us amen it's all
[1:27:14] about him and there's only one supreme
[1:27:16] one Among Us and his name is Jesus
[1:27:19] Christ
[1:27:21] hallelujah amen he is a king of kings
[1:27:25] and the Lord of lords
[1:27:33] he says I always found out that the man
[1:27:36] that humbles himself is a man that God
[1:27:38] exalts
[1:27:40] when you take a person with his chest
[1:27:43] out knows everything you can't tell him
[1:27:45] nothing he's arrogant that person never
[1:27:48] gets anywhere
[1:27:49] but you take that person that'll humble
[1:27:51] themselves and walk sweetly
[1:27:54] listen friends God will exalt him
[1:27:58] people get the wrong impression
[1:28:00] it's powerful brother Birmingham told us
[1:28:02] he said people get the wrong impression
[1:28:03] of the anointing
[1:28:05] or what the anointing is
[1:28:07] they think the anointing is just a bunch
[1:28:09] of noise and amen again I'm making it
[1:28:11] clear to you it's just so there's no
[1:28:13] mistaking this I love noise
[1:28:15] brother Brown said everywhere Jesus was
[1:28:17] there was noise
[1:28:18] Jesus might have been a quiet man and
[1:28:20] spoke softly but I tell you what the
[1:28:22] people around him made a lot of noise
[1:28:25] so hallelujah thank God for the I ain't
[1:28:27] trying to quieten you down but I'm
[1:28:28] telling you the prophet said people get
[1:28:30] the wrong impression
[1:28:32] of what the anointing is and he showed
[1:28:34] the greatest anointing that was on any
[1:28:36] man was on Jesus Christ and he went down
[1:28:38] into the temple one day took the book
[1:28:40] from the hand of the priest amen read
[1:28:42] the scripture said this day the
[1:28:43] scripture is fulfilled and he sat down
[1:28:45] in Precious words amen come from his
[1:28:48] lips even that was what he did with the
[1:28:51] anointing and brother round comes to a
[1:28:53] place he said the anointing is not
[1:28:54] emotion the anointing is supreme power
[1:28:56] in control
[1:28:59] amen knowing exactly what to do and how
[1:29:02] and that's what's here
[1:29:06] Hallelujah I said that's what's here
[1:29:08] listeners we are not just a Pentecostal
[1:29:11] church with a bunch of hide they've been
[1:29:15] in a Big World Cup anyway no that's not
[1:29:18] what this is and don't you ever even
[1:29:20] take even this precious anointing amen
[1:29:24] this thing that God has given us in this
[1:29:25] day and bring it down to just a good
[1:29:28] feeling or just a uh something or an
[1:29:31] emotion
[1:29:33] it's the power of God
[1:29:36] hallelujah it's supreme power in control
[1:29:41] it's knowing what to do and how to do it
[1:29:49] comes in humility
[1:29:51] see that's what that's deity in humanity
[1:29:55] Jesus come to a place
[1:29:59] I'm gonna tell you the victory was one
[1:30:01] in the garden
[1:30:03] you say whim when he said when he said
[1:30:06] not my will
[1:30:09] listen he done that as a man
[1:30:13] the weight of the world on his shoulders
[1:30:15] pressure so great his sweat come as
[1:30:17] blood
[1:30:18] amen and he come to a place amen that he
[1:30:20] surrendered his will
[1:30:24] you want Power
[1:30:25] you want to see the third pull you want
[1:30:28] to see the power of the spoken word amen
[1:30:30] let's get to a place where we are
[1:30:33] surrendering our will to his will
[1:30:36] Hallelujah even when we conquer the
[1:30:38] Flesh and bring us flesh subject to the
[1:30:41] word of God then we'll see the power of
[1:30:43] God then we'll see the realities amen of
[1:30:46] the scripture amen coming to power amen
[1:30:49] God will reveal himself in human flesh
[1:30:55] emptied himself
[1:30:57] he might have himself no reputation that
[1:30:59] actually is
[1:31:00] kinos brother Branham takes it
[1:31:02] and the more common translation is even
[1:31:06] that he emptied himself
[1:31:09] but you got to be careful
[1:31:11] of how you see that
[1:31:14] because Jesus did not empty himself of
[1:31:17] his deity
[1:31:21] he took on Humanity
[1:31:23] see
[1:31:26] he could not become less God
[1:31:29] are you with me even as a king
[1:31:32] that lays aside
[1:31:35] it's like the man the king you know
[1:31:36] you've heard it told how the king he
[1:31:38] wanted he wanted to be he wanted to know
[1:31:41] he wanted to understand he wanted to
[1:31:43] understand what what the people
[1:31:46] how they lived and what they experienced
[1:31:50] and the things that they went through
[1:31:52] and the things that they suffered and
[1:31:53] even so he knew I can't do this as a
[1:31:56] king I can't do this Amen on the throne
[1:31:59] so he lay aside amen he took off his
[1:32:02] robe he lay his crown down he he left
[1:32:04] the throne he dressed himself in the
[1:32:06] clothes of a common man he walked among
[1:32:08] the common people is that right that he
[1:32:11] might understand them
[1:32:14] but listen amen while he was walking
[1:32:16] even he didn't have a robeone he didn't
[1:32:18] have a crown on he wasn't on the throne

[1:32:29] vote walking through the amen walking
[1:32:31] through the streets walking through the
[1:32:33] markets amen he Elizabeth is he was just
[1:32:36] as much King there his word had just as
[1:32:39] much power
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:42] he did not lose even his Dominion
[1:32:46] when he changed his fart
[1:32:49] and neither did Jesus Christ
[1:32:54] Hebrews chapter 2.
[1:32:56] in verse 16.
[1:32:58] for verily he took not on him the nature
[1:33:01] of angels
[1:33:03] but he took on him the Seed of Abraham
[1:33:06] is that right
[1:33:07] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[1:33:09] to make him like his Brethren that he
[1:33:12] might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:33:13] priest and the things pertaining to God
[1:33:15] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[1:33:17] the people for in that he himself
[1:33:19] suffered being tempted he is able to
[1:33:22] secure them that are tempted Amen
[1:33:24] brother Brown said he took on the seat
[1:33:25] of Abraham he become a man God made
[1:33:27] flesh among us to redeem us oh what a
[1:33:30] blessed savior there's just no way to
[1:33:32] write it there's no way to explain it
[1:33:33] it's just bought Beyond explaining amen
[1:33:36] Noah no one can explain how great it is
[1:33:38] How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art
[1:33:42] God had to become Kinfolk to us he had
[1:33:44] to come down as a man suffer be tempted
[1:33:47] be laughed at made fun of persecuted
[1:33:49] ignored call Beelzebub scoffed out
[1:33:51] suffered death under capital punishment
[1:33:54] amen he had to be Kinfolk to us he had
[1:33:57] to be falsely accused because you're
[1:33:59] falsely accused
[1:34:01] he had to Bear sickness because you are
[1:34:03] sick amen he had to Bear sins because it
[1:34:06] was your sins
[1:34:11] the Bible says that he might be a
[1:34:12] faithful murder that's why
[1:34:14] that's why but he he didn't come here he
[1:34:17] didn't even come as a as a full-grown
[1:34:19] man
[1:34:20] he's born as a child and he didn't have
[1:34:23] to do that he humbled himself
[1:34:26] he didn't have to come that way he
[1:34:28] humbled himself
[1:34:30] he was born as a child I mean he grew up
[1:34:33] as a child
[1:34:36] so that all you young people
[1:34:39] could pray to him
[1:34:42] and know that he understands what it is
[1:34:44] to be a teenager
[1:34:47] he didn't bypass that part
[1:34:51] he knows what it is to be where you are
[1:34:54] he come that way that he might be a
[1:34:57] faithful and merciful high priest
[1:35:00] he's submit listen he didn't have to
[1:35:02] have a headache
[1:35:05] deity was in him
[1:35:08] he never had to suffer one moment
[1:35:10] you don't believe that he even told
[1:35:12] Peter put your sword up Peter don't you
[1:35:15] know I could call the Lee I could call
[1:35:16] Legions of angels right now
[1:35:19] to deliver me but then the word wouldn't
[1:35:21] be fulfilled
[1:35:22] he humbled himself to that
[1:35:25] he submitted himself to that he chose
[1:35:27] amen listen friends I I think of the
[1:35:30] humility of Christ think about this
[1:35:32] could you imagine brother Brown said I
[1:35:34] don't and you know I'm not trying to
[1:35:36] cross any Doctrine here so but but I'm
[1:35:38] just I'll just say what the prophet said
[1:35:41] he said it was Jehovah in the manger
[1:35:45] crying over a manure pile
[1:35:48] could you imagine amen Jehovah God
[1:35:51] manifested in flesh
[1:35:54] and he had to Humble himself to be
[1:35:56] raised
[1:35:59] he had to listen to his mom and daddy
[1:36:04] could you imagine God In the Flesh I
[1:36:07] remember I'm showing you what deity
[1:36:09] looks like in humanity
[1:36:11] amen and here amen he humbles himself he
[1:36:13] didn't come down to the Earth and become
[1:36:16] a CEO of a greatest company in the in
[1:36:18] the no he was a helper in a carpenter's
[1:36:20] shop
[1:36:23] Hallelujah so the next time you think
[1:36:25] you're too good to work just remember
[1:36:26] Jesus did
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:29] [Applause]
[1:36:31] Hallelujah
[1:36:33] amen listen he humbled himself even
[1:36:35] think about this I've thought about this
[1:36:37] a lot here is a as as a 12 year old boy
[1:36:40] he walks into the town and confounds
[1:36:42] them with his wisdom
[1:36:45] the word was wrote in every fiber of his
[1:36:47] being Brother Ray
[1:36:49] but he had the greatest gift that a man
[1:36:51] would ever ever would have or ever will
[1:36:53] have the greatest Ministry that there
[1:36:55] could ever been but you know with all
[1:36:57] that locked up with it inside of him he
[1:37:00] didn't even start his ministry until he
[1:37:01] was 30 years old
[1:37:04] because he humbled himself to the will
[1:37:07] of God
[1:37:08] he could have preached the greatest
[1:37:09] sermons even he could he could have the
[1:37:12] greatest Ministry he could have done it
[1:37:14] as a teenager
[1:37:16] he could have done it in his twenties
[1:37:19] come on Sir don't tell me he couldn't he
[1:37:21] could have done it at any time he chose
[1:37:22] to do it but he humbled himself
[1:37:25] well I'll tell you it's good for us
[1:37:26] preachers to remind ourselves of that
[1:37:28] because we get the idea sometimes it's
[1:37:30] somebody else wasn't in my way I'd
[1:37:32] preach every meeting in the country or
[1:37:34] somebody else amen wasn't in my way then
[1:37:36] I'd be the even one of the top preachers
[1:37:38] and amen or or you know and we got such
[1:37:40] a great ministry and such a power even
[1:37:42] though somebody just give me a chance or
[1:37:44] somebody amen but the problem is is
[1:37:46] there's politics and you can and you and
[1:37:49] you get a chip on your shoulder and a
[1:37:51] complex
[1:37:53] because God has put a gift in your life
[1:37:56] amen but I say this if you'll just let
[1:37:58] go of all that and let God use you
[1:38:02] whenever he wants to use you however he
[1:38:06] wants to use you then you'll see the
[1:38:08] supernatural
[1:38:11] humble yourself
[1:38:16] Jesus humbled himself in every way in
[1:38:18] his ministry in his life you don't think
[1:38:20] you don't think he had desires
[1:38:23] as a man there was a there was a human
[1:38:25] part
[1:38:28] you know he had desires the Bible says
[1:38:31] he was tempted
[1:38:33] in every point
[1:38:35] yet without sin
[1:38:40] things
[1:38:42] unfulfilled
[1:38:44] desires
[1:38:48] he he he there was no no doubt maybe as
[1:38:52] he walked here as a man he he could have
[1:38:54] desired to have a companion
[1:38:58] maybe to have children
[1:39:00] but you know what he laid all that aside
[1:39:03] because God already gave him a bride
[1:39:06] and he says she's worth waiting on
[1:39:09] Hallelujah he was looking at you and he
[1:39:13] laid down his his natural Earthly
[1:39:15] desires
[1:39:17] because he already had a bride it was
[1:39:20] already a promise he already he already
[1:39:22] knew he was going to have children
[1:39:24] he already knew he was going to have
[1:39:26] seed
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:31] he humbled himself
[1:39:36] humbled himself all the way even to the
[1:39:39] death of the cross
[1:39:42] this is complete opposite of Satan
[1:39:48] Lucifer
[1:39:50] the actual name Lucifer means light
[1:39:52] bearer
[1:39:53] The Shining one
[1:39:55] the Morning Star
[1:39:57] Amen brother Ben would come on and say
[1:39:59] look he he was he was uh even uh
[1:40:03] co-equal with God in all but creation
[1:40:05] right there I believe it would say it
[1:40:07] this way he was God's right-hand man
[1:40:10] even right there amen but the Book of
[1:40:13] Ezekiel talks about Ezekiel 28 Amen in
[1:40:15] verse 12 says son of man take up a
[1:40:17] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and
[1:40:19] say unto him thus saith the Lord God
[1:40:21] thou seal us up the sun full of wisdom

[1:40:30] covering the the the Sardis the topaz
[1:40:33] the diamond and on and on it goes amen
[1:40:35] and the workmanship of thy tablets out
[1:40:38] of thy pipes were prepared in thee in
[1:40:40] the day that thou was created Thou Art
[1:40:42] the anointed cherub now look at this
[1:40:44] word this is he's speaking of Satan Thou
[1:40:47] Art the anointed cherub that covereth I
[1:40:49] have said thee so thou is upon the holy
[1:40:51] mountain of God thou has walked up and
[1:40:53] down in the midst of the stones of fire
[1:40:54] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[1:40:58] day thou was created till iniquity was
[1:41:01] found in thee
[1:41:03] amen and uh and what was that iniquity
[1:41:05] amen that iniquity was that he desired a
[1:41:10] position that didn't belong to him
[1:41:17] look in Isaiah 14.
[1:41:20] how are thou falling from Heaven oh
[1:41:21] Lucifer
[1:41:23] son of the morning Howard thou cut down
[1:41:25] to the ground which did weaken the
[1:41:26] Nations

[1:41:29] thou has said in thine heart is that
[1:41:32] right
[1:41:33] I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt
[1:41:36] my throne above the stars of God I will
[1:41:39] sit in the Mount of the congregation and
[1:41:41] the size of the Lord I will Ascend above
[1:41:43] the heights of the clouds I will be like
[1:41:46] the most high amen look at just in those
[1:41:49] couple verses how many times you hear I
[1:41:51] will I will Ascend I will be I will I
[1:41:54] will exalt
[1:41:56] amen let me tell you sir I'm identifying
[1:41:59] a spirit
[1:42:00] amen the spirit of Christ will reveal
[1:42:03] itself in humility
[1:42:05] amen but the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:42:07] amen will will always be exalting
[1:42:10] yourself
[1:42:13] I will ascend
[1:42:15] but the Bible say yet thou shall be
[1:42:17] brought down to Hell
[1:42:19] to the sides of the pit watch brother
[1:42:21] Brown and Satan's Eden now over here
[1:42:23] with the scriptures in Thessalonians he
[1:42:26] sits in the temple of God exalting
[1:42:27] himself above all this called God so
[1:42:30] that he is as that he as God is
[1:42:32] worshiped as God upon the Earth there's
[1:42:34] a God of this world I preached about
[1:42:36] last Sunday here he is today in deceit
[1:42:38] within this treacherous hour this
[1:42:40] tremendous time that we're living in the
[1:42:41] most glorious time of all the ages but
[1:42:43] we're facing or because we're facing the
[1:42:45] great Millennium again we're facing
[1:42:47] again but right at this age all the
[1:42:49] deceit every tactic that he's ever used
[1:42:51] has been able to deceive with he's
[1:42:54] gathered it all together and reinforced
[1:42:56] himself and come down like God and he's
[1:42:58] put himself in the place of God
[1:43:01] religious can quote scripture tell you
[1:43:05] the scripture just like Satan did to
[1:43:06] even the garden but leave one spot out
[1:43:08] that's all he has to do to make a gap so
[1:43:11] the poison doctrine of the devil can
[1:43:12] pour through there
[1:43:14] even though I said he would exalt
[1:43:15] himself above the most high with a sin
[1:43:17] above the clouds and the Stars he would
[1:43:19] sit there like God and be the most high
[1:43:22] and he has succeeded in carrying out his
[1:43:26] threats he certainly had a marvelous
[1:43:28] success in carrying out his threats by
[1:43:30] the people letting him explain away in
[1:43:33] every age the value of God's promised
[1:43:36] word to that age that's exactly how he's
[1:43:38] done it in every age now the prophet is
[1:43:41] showing you Satan has been successful
[1:43:44] he's had a marvelous success in carrying
[1:43:47] out his strength to be worshiped as God
[1:43:50] Amen to sit in the temple of God being
[1:43:52] worshiped ask God Amen but watch amen he
[1:43:55] said he has had a marvelously by how by
[1:43:58] the people allowing him to explain away
[1:44:01] the value of God's promised word for the
[1:44:03] age let me tell you something I ain't
[1:44:05] gonna have no part in Satan's success
[1:44:09] is there anybody with me this morning I
[1:44:11] will have no part in Satan success so
[1:44:13] anything or anybody or any voice that be
[1:44:17] values or belittles amen what God has
[1:44:21] done in our generation are the message
[1:44:23] of this hour I refuse to accept it or
[1:44:27] hear it
[1:44:30] hallelujah it's Satan's success
[1:44:36] sitting in the temple of God being
[1:44:38] worshiped as God
[1:44:39] there was no other agent because Satan
[1:44:41] brother Ben said no other days no every
[1:44:43] time it was called the God of this evil
[1:44:45] age
[1:44:47] she is his ambition to be like God from
[1:44:49] the very beginning it was his ambition
[1:44:51] to be like God Amen Satan desires the
[1:44:55] throne
[1:44:57] he desires worship
[1:44:59] and he's getting it
[1:45:03] I know somebody you're sitting here
[1:45:05] thinking this way yeah amen they're
[1:45:07] they're worshiping Satan out there's a
[1:45:09] bunch of devil worshipers out there
[1:45:12] and their worshiping Satan and they are
[1:45:15] and he'll take it
[1:45:18] even but that was not the Fulfillment of
[1:45:20] his desire
[1:45:21] he said I want us I want to be in the
[1:45:23] house of God
[1:45:25] and be worshiped as God
[1:45:28] and through deception
[1:45:30] listen to church people are standing
[1:45:32] amen amen in pulpits
[1:45:35] even even this morning and there's
[1:45:37] people in the pews and they're praising
[1:45:40] and they're worshiping and they don't
[1:45:42] know what they're worshiping
[1:45:45] Hallelujah and they think they're
[1:45:46] worshiping God but they're worshiping
[1:45:48] Satan
[1:45:50] and sometimes they're very enthusiastic
[1:45:52] about it
[1:45:55] hallelujah amen and Satan is receiving
[1:45:58] their worship and it's fulfilling his
[1:46:00] desire
[1:46:02] I start thinking about it and I thought
[1:46:04] if they can get excited out there
[1:46:06] praising the devil
[1:46:08] and they can raise their hands and they
[1:46:10] can shout hallelujah and they can sing
[1:46:12] their songs and they can and it's
[1:46:13] fulfilling the desire that lays and say
[1:46:15] even if my God wants to be praised amen
[1:46:18] there ain't no devil hallelujah amen I
[1:46:22] want the devil to know this morning we
[1:46:24] ain't here to Worship You devil we are
[1:46:26] here to praise the turn the Living God
[1:46:29] hallelujah amen if Satan is receiving
[1:46:33] worship let God receive the worship of
[1:46:36] his bride
[1:46:40] Hallelujah
[1:46:44] is it Satan's ambition to be worshiped
[1:46:46] as God listen
[1:46:49] the Bible says Revelations 12 and there
[1:46:52] appeared another verse 3 and there
[1:46:54] appeared another Wonder in heaven Behold
[1:46:56] a great Dragon having seven heads and
[1:46:58] ten and the Lord and seven crowns upon
[1:46:59] his head
[1:47:00] and his tail
[1:47:03] now because remember it was his ambition
[1:47:05] he had this desire
[1:47:07] amen and his tale Brothers tail
[1:47:11] it's a Telly told
[1:47:13] amen it was by that tale that he told
[1:47:16] that he drew to himself
[1:47:18] is that right amen uh the third part of
[1:47:21] the stars of heaven and they cast them
[1:47:23] to the earth and the dragon amen stood
[1:47:25] before you know the scripture amen watch
[1:47:27] Jude as he picks it up and the sixth
[1:47:29] verse he said and the angels which kept
[1:47:31] not their first estate amen listen Satan
[1:47:34] preached the sermon in heaven and it was
[1:47:36] so powerful
[1:47:37] it was so powerful that that there are a
[1:47:40] third of the Angels were deceived
[1:47:44] the angels that kept not their first
[1:47:46] estate but left their own habitation as
[1:47:48] we reserved Amen in the Everlasting
[1:47:50] change into darkness under the Judgment
[1:47:51] of the great day amen II Corinthians 11
[1:47:54] 14 and no Marvel
[1:47:56] for Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:47:59] angel of Light
[1:48:01] therefore it is no great thing if his
[1:48:04] ministers
[1:48:05] also be transformed as the Ministers of
[1:48:09] righteousness whose ends shall be
[1:48:11] according to their works amen ain't that
[1:48:14] amazing that Satan amen has ministers
[1:48:19] plural
[1:48:21] Hallelujah Satan's got ministers amen
[1:48:25] that has transformed themselves into
[1:48:27] messengers of light
[1:48:29] and they're preaching his Doctrine
[1:48:32] amen I'm just going to say this because
[1:48:34] Satan this is a reality Satan amen is
[1:48:37] always copying God he looks at what God
[1:48:40] does and then he copies it
[1:48:43] and Satan is not all by himself he's got
[1:48:46] a Ministry he's got ministers that are
[1:48:50] standing in prayer but I tell you what
[1:48:53] if there's a false Ministry there's got
[1:48:55] to be a real one somewhere Hallelujah
[1:48:57] and just as sure as Saints got ministers
[1:49:00] standing in a bump in God has got a
[1:49:03] five-fold Ministry
[1:49:06] Hallelujah
[1:49:08] ministers that are preaching the pure
[1:49:11] word
[1:49:13] the unadulterated word
[1:49:19] what just started in heaven is that
[1:49:21] right
[1:49:22] started in heaven he began to preach his
[1:49:24] Doctrine
[1:49:26] and it deceived many
[1:49:29] but not all
[1:49:31] because the Bible says there was elect
[1:49:32] angels
[1:49:36] let me just make this clear you wasn't
[1:49:38] ever an angel you'll never be an angel
[1:49:41] but God had something in heaven to
[1:49:43] represent something he was going to have
[1:49:45] on Earth
[1:49:47] Hallelujah them Angels Amen in heaven
[1:49:50] amen when they heard Satan's lie amen
[1:49:52] amen they withstood that lie and they
[1:49:55] stood with Michael
[1:49:57] Hallelujah the elect angels in heaven
[1:50:00] amen stew and Michael and Cass Satan out
[1:50:06] Hallelujah and if God had angels in
[1:50:08] heaven I believe this morning he's got
[1:50:10] people on the Earth
[1:50:13] there's an electron of Jesus Christ
[1:50:16] Hallelujah them Angels represented you
[1:50:19] amen and Satan is going about like a
[1:50:22] roaring lion seeking to me may devour
[1:50:24] and the whole world is falling under his

[2:03:46] every tactic Every Lie every deceit he's
[2:03:50] trying and he's trying to penetrate even
[2:03:53] the fortification of the word around
[2:03:55] this bride but he has failed
[2:04:00] Hallelujah he is a failure
[2:04:04] because there's a bride that is already
[2:04:08] sealed with a word of her hour
[2:04:12] [Applause]
[2:04:14] he will not take the Throne of my heart
[2:04:21] glory to God that place is already

[2:14:30] of no reputation
[2:14:32] he took on the form of a servant it was
[2:14:36] made in the likeness of men
[2:14:38] and being found as a fashion as a man he
[2:14:40] humbled himself and become obedient unto
[2:14:43] death even the death of the cross
[2:14:45] wherefore God also has highly
[2:14:48] exalted him
[2:14:52] and give him a name
[2:14:54] which is above every name
[2:14:57] that at the name of Jesus
[2:14:59] every knee
[2:15:01] should bow

[2:50:57] I don't know if y'all enjoyed it I
[2:50:59] really enjoyed this part Satan's as high
[2:51:02] as he's getting
[2:51:04] I just love that he says hi as he's
[2:51:07] going to get
[2:51:08] but we're as low as we're ever going to
[2:51:10] be
[2:51:12] I just that just exploded in my heart
[2:51:17] but however little
[2:51:19] you're as low as you're ever going to be
[2:51:21] it's up from here
[2:51:23] I say glory to God Amen isn't it
[2:51:26] something that God finally lets Satan
[2:51:28] rule the world he only lasts a few years
[2:51:31] just a few minutes and it's all over
[2:51:33] and he and it was everything he desired
[2:51:36] but because of the humility of Christ
[2:51:39] that's coming the heart of the people
[2:51:40] they humble themselves
[2:51:42] and when you get up to the height of
[2:51:44] your Heights it will be throughout
[2:51:46] eternity
