[2:08] a blessing Sunday mornings and it's kind
[2:11] of like a special time of the week I
[2:12] know that it uh brother brandom and the
[2:15] scripture didn't allot it to a different
[2:16] type of day but just somehow it's a
[2:18] little bit the honoring of a

[2:32] to maybe bow our hearts for a word of
[2:34] prayer before we go into the word
[2:37] Heavenly Father we're certainly honored
[2:39] to be standing here and Lord we're we're
[2:42] not worthy of your grace of your mercy
[2:45] but you have been so kind to us Lord and
[2:48] the mercy that you have shown us in our
[2:50] lives and Lord to reveal to our hearts
[2:53] this great Word of Life father we're
[2:55] more thankful for that than anything
[2:57] that I know we thank you for the family
[3:00] and for the church Lord and for the
[3:03] ministry that you've placed here and the
[3:05] elders and Lord all the officers father
[3:08] that would make this possible to be here
[3:10] this morning this Gathering of people
[3:13] Lord You're we can see the great hand of
[3:16] your system of your Holy Ghost how it's
[3:18] been operated in all the gifts Lord
[3:21] that's been placed in this body and Lord
[3:24] we ask you this morning that may you
[3:26] give Grace to us one more time that your
[3:28] presence would come Lord that you would
[3:30] confirm your word true Lord we'd be the
[3:33] first person to admit oh God that we're
[3:36] helpless without you we confess it
[3:39] openly before all people Lord that
[3:41] without you we are nothing and we have
[3:43] no hope in this life but Lord if You'
[3:46] just come by this morning Lord and touch
[3:48] your children we would give you the
[3:49] glory and the honor we ask you father
[3:52] that you would do what no man could do
[3:54] may you heal the bodies of your people
[3:56] this morning and Lord may you touch
[3:59] their life may you send a delivering
[4:01] Spirit here in the building this morning
[4:04] and Lord I just pray for your glory and
[4:06] your grace Among Us now we ask it in
[4:09] Jesus name amen and amen and God richly
[4:14] bless you this morning if you have your
[4:16] Bibles we would just like to turn into
[4:18] the Book of
[4:20] Daniel uh if it's okay with you I'm
[4:22] going to continue just a little bit from
[4:25] here today Daniel the 2 chapter and uh
[4:29] we don't have brother Nathan to read
[4:31] this morning so we're going to shorten
[4:33] this to the to the end of this uh where
[4:35] we've already read the the the scripture
[4:38] if you were he um but I just going to
[4:41] read just a little portion
[4:43] here in Daniel the 2 chapter verses 40
[4:47] down to verse
[4:49] 45 we're going to just we're going to
[4:51] skip down to the fourth
[4:53] Kingdom Daniel chapter 2 verse 40
[4:58] 45 and the fourth Kingdom should be
[5:00] strong as iron for as much as the iron
[5:02] breth in pieces and seduth all things
[5:06] and as iron that breth all these shall
[5:08] it break into pieces and
[5:10] Bruise whereas thou sawest the feet and
[5:13] the toes and part of The Potter's clay
[5:15] and part iron the kingdom shall be
[5:17] divided but there shall be in it a
[5:19] strength of iron for as much as thou
[5:21] sawest the iron mixed with myy clay and
[5:24] as the toes of the feet were part of
[5:26] iron and part of clay so the kingdom
[5:28] should be part strong and partly broken
[5:33] now whereas thou sawest the iron mixed
[5:35] with myy Clay they shall mingle
[5:37] themselves with the seed of men isn't it
[5:40] odd that that scripture right there now
[5:42] that's speaking of the marriage between
[5:45] the Protestants and the Romans and that
[5:47] didn't take place until Kennedy in the
[5:50] 1960s when they began to mingle marry
[5:53] but the said they did it to break the
[5:55] power of it uh but they shall not cleave
[5:58] one to another even as I iron is not
[6:01] mixed with clay and in the days and in
[6:05] the days of these Kings shall the god of
[6:07] Heaven set up a
[6:08] kingdom which shall not be destroyed my
[6:11] that feels good don't it and in the days
[6:14] of these kingdoms shall the god of
[6:16] Heaven set up a kingdom which shall not
[6:18] be destroyed and the kingdom shall not
[6:21] be left to other people but it shall
[6:24] break in pieces and consume all the
[6:26] kingdoms and it shall stand forever for
[6:30] as much as thou sawest that the stone
[6:32] was cut out of the mountain without
[6:34] hands that it break in pieces the iron
[6:36] the brass the clay the silver the gold
[6:38] and the great God hath made known to the
[6:40] king what shall come to pass Hereafter
[6:43] and the dream is certain and the
[6:45] interpretation thereof sure we ask the
[6:49] Lord to bless his words you could be
[6:51] seated uh I want to just continue uh out
[6:54] of this Daniel the second chapter here
[6:55] we're going to be uh continuing in this
[6:58] image of Daniel
[7:00] uh what he saw in the fourth Kingdom of
[7:03] course uh we took a little time on last
[7:06] Sunday to to present to you the idea
[7:09] amen that this fourth Kingdom of course
[7:11] was Rome and that how Rome was going to
[7:14] be divided into two parts both east and
[7:17] west and we saw that in history we saw
[7:19] Rome ruling from the time of Christ and
[7:23] of course they followed the great
[7:24] Kingdom of of Alexander the Great in
[7:26] Greece and then we seen Rome rise up and
[7:28] become a world power but then we seen
[7:31] Rome itself breaking into the East and
[7:33] West when Europe was developed it then
[7:36] began to move down into the 10 toes
[7:38] which now of course Rome has not
[7:40] disappeared but it exists in every
[7:43] nation on the earth it's a system
[7:45] brother B said see then we see Rome has
[7:47] two churches it has the Protestant
[7:50] church and it has the Catholic church so
[7:54] it has two churches it's a it's both
[7:56] denominational Protestant and it's the
[7:59] Roman Church is the Catholic Church of
[8:01] course and so we see then that the
[8:03] system of romanism or denomination has
[8:06] worked itself into every one of them now
[8:09] that's in the religious Powers now when
[8:12] you read this you you you we we seen
[8:15] last week of course that the image of
[8:18] Daniel was resulted in what was called
[8:21] in Daniel the 2 chapter but if it was
[8:23] only Daniel 2 that's one thing but now
[8:26] we also know that Daniel repeatedly sing
[8:29] this order of Kingdoms throughout the
[8:31] Book of Daniel also in the Book of
[8:33] Daniel the 7th chapter we'll read now uh
[8:36] from the 7th to the 13th verse I'm going
[8:39] to wait for him to pull it up and after
[8:41] I saw a night vision and behold a fourth
[8:43] Beast now the fourth Kingdom now we're
[8:46] seeing it as a fourth beast in Daniel 7
[8:48] this is Daniel's own vision and behold
[8:51] the fourth vision of the fourth Beast
[8:53] Dreadful and terrible and strong
[8:55] exceedingly and it had a great iron
[8:57] teeth and devoured and break in pieces
[9:00] and stamped the residue with the feet of
[9:01] it and it was diverse from all the
[9:04] beasts that were before it and it had 10
[9:06] horns and I considered the horns and
[9:09] behold there Came Upon them another
[9:11] little horn which whom there were three
[9:13] of the first horns plucked up by the
[9:15] roots and behold in this horn were the
[9:17] eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth
[9:19] speaking great things and I beheld it
[9:22] till the Thrones were cast down and the
[9:25] Ancient of Days did set whose garment
[9:27] was white as snow and is the hair the
[9:30] head like the pure wool his throne was
[9:32] like a fiery flame and his wheels of a
[9:35] burning fire and a fiery stream issued
[9:38] came forth from before him thousands
[9:40] ministered unto him 10 thousands time 10
[9:42] thousand stood before him the judge was
[9:44] said and the books were open so you're
[9:46] seeing that the Ancient of Days was the
[9:48] great judge which will end up at the
[9:51] white Throne of judgment here in the
[9:52] 10th verse now we go on to the next
[9:54] verse 11th and I beheld them because the
[9:56] voice of the great words which the horn
[9:58] spake I be H till even the Beast was
[10:00] slain the body destroyed and giving to
[10:03] the Burning
[10:04] Flame and concerning the rest of the
[10:06] Beast they had their Dominion taken away
[10:08] yet their lives were prolonged for a
[10:10] season and a Time amen and I saw in the
[10:14] night visions and one like the son of
[10:16] man came with the Clouds Of Heaven that
[10:19] seem familiar didn't y'all and I sing
[10:21] the son of man came with the clouds of
[10:23] heaven and came to the Ancient of Days
[10:26] and they brought him near before him
[10:29] amen now if if you're reading now in
[10:32] Daniel chapter 2 we're watching the
[10:34] fourth Kingdom and we're seeing that a
[10:36] stone is going to strike the toes of
[10:39] that Kingdom so we're seeing the kingdom
[10:40] is Rome and it's called a stone hued out
[10:43] of the mountain striking it when you're
[10:46] reading Daniel 7 it's called a fourth
[10:48] Kingdom or a fourth beast and now you're
[10:51] seeing the Ancient of Days putting it in
[10:53] its place so the stone of Daniel 2 and
[10:57] the one called the ancient of d days of
[10:59] Daniel 7 is the same one it's not two
[11:03] different people it's two symbols that
[11:05] are showing the same thing if the fourth
[11:07] kingdom is Rome and the thing that
[11:09] destroys it then it's the same thing
[11:11] whether it's the stone or whether it's
[11:13] the Ancient of Days now John saw those
[11:16] beasts now again we want to look in
[11:18] Revelations 13 and see that John saw
[11:22] exactly the same thing go to Revelations
[11:24] 13: 1 and 2 and I stood upon the sand of
[11:27] the sea and saw a beast R up out of the
[11:30] sea having seven heads and 10 horns and
[11:32] upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his
[11:35] head the name of blasphemy amen and the
[11:38] Beast which I saw was like it unto a
[11:39] leopard and his feet were as the feet of
[11:41] a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a
[11:43] lion and the dragon gave him power and
[11:45] his seat and great Authority now when
[11:47] you're when you're reading that you're
[11:49] reading about the Beast that Daniel saw
[11:52] in Daniel 7 and now you're seeing it not
[11:55] as four separate beasts now we're seeing
[11:58] all of the Beast as one they're combined
[12:00] in one power in other words Rome has the
[12:03] power of all former kingdoms and now
[12:05] it's been developed in the one now it
[12:08] looked like Rome lost its power when you
[12:10] go to Revelation chap 13 and you'll see
[12:13] I think it's about the third verse and
[12:15] the Bible says that this this and we
[12:17] went through it last week so I'm not re
[12:19] rehearse it but this this looked like
[12:21] that it was killed but its deadly wound
[12:24] was healed which was the transferring
[12:26] from the pap Rome or from Pagan Rome to
[12:29] Papa roome but look at how that in the
[12:32] 13th uh there it is I saw one of the
[12:34] heads that was wounded to death and his
[12:35] deadly wound was healed and all the
[12:37] world wandered after the Beast now
[12:39] brother M teaches us specifically that's
[12:41] when it changes from a pagan Rome World
[12:44] system to a papa Rome World system so
[12:47] that's how it exists in Greater Powers
[12:49] through Papa Rome now in the 13th
[12:51] chapter and the 11th verse then we're
[12:53] going to see this is America coming up
[12:56] out of the scripture so isn't it amazing
[12:59] that God would show America in scripture
[13:02] amen it only was developed over 200
[13:04] years ago but God sing this message
[13:07] coming out of this place oh I mean
[13:10] thousands of years ago amen and I beheld
[13:13] another Beast coming up out of the earth
[13:15] so we're seeing that coming up out of
[13:17] the earth and he had two horns like a
[13:18] lamb and spake as a dragon read that
[13:20] next verse and spake as a dragon and
[13:23] exercise all the power of the first
[13:24] Beast before him and causes the Earth
[13:27] and them which that dwell in to worship
[13:29] the Beast with deadly wound was healed
[13:31] so you see he exercised the power of the
[13:33] same be if you watch this one coming out
[13:35] of the land in a little while he will
[13:37] make an image unto the Beast so the
[13:39] image unto the Beast of course the Beast
[13:41] is Rome it's Roman Catholicism but then
[13:44] there is an image unto the Beast which
[13:46] is the World Council of churches how
[13:48] many realize that's coming in the 1960s
[13:51] is where the World Council of churches
[13:52] was being developed and at the same time
[13:55] the World Council of churches was being
[13:57] developed isn't it amazing God had a
[13:59] prophet on the scene and he was striking
[14:02] against it the whole time he was saying
[14:04] it's completely of the devil don't you
[14:07] ever get in denomination don't you ever
[14:09] let them organize you don't you ever let
[14:11] them do it because he's he's actually
[14:13] showing that what it is it is a
[14:16] denominational system and that's how
[14:18] exactly Rome would rule the world now
[14:21] brother Ram is the one that's striking
[14:23] at this thing because it's his ministry
[14:25] to do so amen we see that he does this
[14:28] of course we see the the land and the
[14:30] sea in Revelations 13 and then we'll
[14:33] rehearse this from Revelation 10: 1- 2
[14:37] in chapter 10 verse one and I saw
[14:39] another Mighty Angel come down from
[14:41] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[14:42] rainbow was upon his face now we're back
[14:44] in Daniel 7 again amen and clothed with
[14:47] a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his
[14:49] Feast his face were as the sun and his
[14:52] feet as pillars of fire you that sound
[14:55] familiar anybody think about the pillar
[14:57] of Fire coming in this generation amen
[15:00] now watch and he had in his hand a
[15:02] little book open there's the word and he
[15:04] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[15:08] left foot upon the earth now here he is
[15:11] dominating the power of Revelations 13
[15:14] in Daniel two the stone was dominating
[15:17] the power of that great image in Daniel
[15:19] 7 the Ancient of Days was putting that
[15:22] that fourth Kingdom in his place in
[15:24] Revelations 13 it's a system coming out
[15:27] of water and out of sea and out of the
[15:29] land and out of the sea in Revelations
[15:31] 10 so we see Revelations 10 is the stone
[15:35] of Daniel 2 and it's the Ancient of Days
[15:38] of Daniel 7 amen now somebody says to me
[15:41] well brother Wayne I I thought you know
[15:43] this was all back in the future and all
[15:45] these things has happen let me let me
[15:47] just say this to you in Amos I third
[15:49] chapter the Bible said that God would do
[15:51] nothing until first he reveals it unto
[15:54] his servants the prophets so if there's
[15:56] going to be a fall of the entire World
[15:59] wouldn't God send a prophet first if
[16:02] there's going to be a fall of every
[16:03] World system if everything that you know
[16:06] is going to be annihilated wouldn't God
[16:08] send the prophet and warn that
[16:11] generation and condemn the devil and
[16:13] pull the scheme off of him of course he
[16:15] would do it he cannot do nothing and
[16:18] first until he does it in the second
[16:20] seal brother Adam says this I don't know
[16:22] when I don't know what's going to happen
[16:24] I don't know when it's going to happen
[16:26] but it's going to because he's revealing
[16:29] it right now he doesn't do anything
[16:31] until he makes it known unto a prophet
[16:34] first and he promised these things would
[16:36] come to pass in the last days now listen
[16:38] in the second seal paragraph 332 it will
[16:41] be revealed and those broken seals will
[16:44] reveal it and here they are now this is
[16:47] in the name of the Lord believe it
[16:50] friends come out of
[16:52] Babylon so the prophet is showing you
[16:55] that when the seals are opening it's
[16:57] revealing the of Babylon which is the
[17:00] call to the church to come out of
[17:03] Babylon to come out of Babylon Now isn't
[17:06] it beautiful because it didn't say just
[17:08] come out of the Roman Church it doesn't
[17:10] say just come out of the Protestant
[17:12] church but Babylon is a symbol of
[17:15] confusion of religion in the end time so
[17:18] come out of confusion now wherever that
[17:21] is if it's Independence if it's
[17:23] denominational if it's coming from Roman
[17:25] Church anything outside of vindication
[17:28] is confusion and he's saying come out of
[17:31] it amen come out of the homemade
[17:33] religion come out of the homemade
[17:35] Revelations come out of the ideas of man
[17:37] come out of the whole thing and stand
[17:40] upon the rock of vindication in this
[17:43] hour listen there's nothing going to
[17:44] stand outside of this message in this
[17:46] generation my Bible said that God shook
[17:49] the Earth he said this time he will
[17:51] shake the heavens and everything that
[17:54] can be shaken will be shaken but we have
[17:57] received a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[18:00] amen we've not received a throne and
[18:02] we've not received a city but we have
[18:05] received a Vindicated word from almighty
[18:07] God which is the stone of Revelation
[18:11] which is the truth of almighty God and
[18:13] it'll tear down every Kingdom look what
[18:15] it done in your personal lives look how
[18:17] it tore down the devil in your personal
[18:20] lives the one that sets up the entire
[18:23] Earth is amen Christ the Vindicated word
[18:26] which amen you're being invited to come
[18:29] into now the iron and Clay of course
[18:32] were the big toes
[18:34] of of course of Daniel's Visionary or
[18:37] Daniel's dream interpretation in Daniel
[18:39] 2 uh the the great image of of Gentiles
[18:43] had 10 toes now there's two big toes on
[18:46] those tin toes y'all remember from last
[18:48] Sunday what they were amen they were kof
[18:50] and Eisenhower kof being Russian
[18:54] represented the Eastern world and
[18:56] Eisenhower representing the Western
[18:58] world so there was one on each foot
[19:00] right and there was a big toe of iron
[19:03] and Clay there they were the big toes
[19:05] brother ram calls them the big toes now
[19:07] amen in the time of those big toes they
[19:10] wasn't toes they were men and those men
[19:13] were representing a power that was
[19:16] coming out of the scripture amen and at
[19:18] the same time that these Kings is upon
[19:21] the Earth the rock would strike that
[19:23] image so that rock then is represented
[19:26] by a prophet of God in this age which is
[19:29] bringing the power of our kingdom upon
[19:32] this Earth isn't it powerful to know
[19:35] that the word you're receiving right now
[19:37] will be a word that will grow into the
[19:39] mountain of New Jerusalem there will not
[19:42] be a change of administration from now
[19:45] unto the mountain of the New Jerusalem
[19:47] we're not going to have to change
[19:49] Messengers we're not going to have to
[19:50] switch horses amen there's not another
[19:53] corner to turn there were only four
[19:55] corners of Redemption Church there was
[19:57] only a word to restored to the bride of
[20:00] Christ and we have received a restored
[20:02] word I I think of it like this we can
[20:04] run with the message of Malachi 4 we
[20:07] don't have to check brother brandom we
[20:08] don't have to sit down and wonder if
[20:10] what he taught was right or can we can
[20:12] we trust it to preach it we can preach
[20:15] exactly what brother random said because
[20:17] he is the authority in the age that
[20:20] we're living and the Vindicated word of
[20:23] God is our absolute Authority against
[20:26] every demonic power remember he bound
[20:29] that Serpent and the Lord told him from
[20:31] this to everything below it from the
[20:33] greatest to the least this message will
[20:35] bang the devil and all of his powers and
[20:39] all of his World Systems upon your life
[20:42] now that Prophet is bringing in another
[20:44] kingdom this Prophet builds amen the
[20:47] prophet builds the church in the 70th
[20:49] week of Daniel he builds it from the
[20:51] platform of faith of Paul and he takes
[20:53] it all the way to the seventh age he
[20:56] said but now we're expecting the
[20:57] headstone is that right we're expecting
[21:00] The Headstone now there are many that
[21:03] believe that the headstone only
[21:05] represents the Corporal body of Jesus
[21:06] Christ I am not in that school I believe
[21:09] the headstone is the Revelation that is
[21:12] brought to the church in this hour amen
[21:14] because William brandom's commission how
[21:16] many knows this Commission on the on the
[21:18] on the river was to introduce Jesus
[21:21] Christ for the second coming amen how
[21:24] many knows that the message was to
[21:25] introduce now either he introduced him
[21:28] or he didn't fulfill his commission
[21:30] either he brought him on the earth or he
[21:32] didn't fulfill his commission but he
[21:34] said the seventh seal brings him back to
[21:37] the Earth amen now we didn't see a Jesus
[21:40] separate from the Willam brandom and
[21:42] that's the confusing part but as Elijah
[21:44] introduced the first Jesus he did it the
[21:47] first season by pointing out a man who
[21:50] was born of a virgin and said Behold the
[21:53] Lamb of God brother randam said but this
[21:55] Elijah will do the same very thing by po
[21:58] out a word born bride because Christ has
[22:02] become in a bride form in the age that
[22:05] we living in he did not introduced Jesus
[22:07] outside our body he introduced him as
[22:10] the word which comes into the church oh
[22:13] Church of the Living God you're the
[22:15] answer to this generation you're the
[22:17] Church of the Living God that will not
[22:19] fall by Creeds and system and
[22:21] denomination there is a Vindicated bride
[22:25] upon the face of the Earth it's Rapture
[22:27] season it's Rapture time how do you know
[22:31] it is brother Wayne because the life is
[22:33] now in the body identified by the
[22:36] original headship the life that's in you
[22:39] is the same identical life that was in
[22:42] Jesus Christ my Lord It's Not Another
[22:46] Jesus it's the same Jesus in a bright
[22:50] form it's not another God it's God who's
[22:54] in the church God above us God with us
[22:57] but it's God God in
[22:59] us now I can stand here with these
[23:01] scriptures all day long and prove to you
[23:03] you are the answer to this
[23:06] generation this started with a prophet
[23:09] if it only stays with a prophet then the
[23:11] scriptures are not true it strikes as a
[23:14] rock and grows into a mountain then
[23:17] William brandom as John said I will
[23:19] decrease and he will increase William
[23:22] brandham said the same thing to this
[23:24] generation I'm leaving the scene now
[23:27] amen but I have in uced you to
[23:29] him come on now he said I will decrease
[23:33] and he will increase this message has
[23:35] increased a hundredfold since brother
[23:38] Ram left the scene it's not only him
[23:40] preaching it now across the world our
[23:43] ministers have caught the revelation of
[23:46] this hour and the son of man has
[23:48] increased in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[23:51] Living out the manifestations of this
[23:53] age my there's one place this Roman
[23:56] system won't take over it's the the
[23:58] Church of the Living God there is a
[24:00] pride upon the Earth that will not be
[24:03] defiled she will not be tore down she
[24:06] will not allow that adulterous spirit in
[24:08] her life she has one husband amen and
[24:11] that husband is the Vindicated word of
[24:14] the age she's living in that's where
[24:16] your worship belongs it belongs in the
[24:18] word it belongs in the message the
[24:21] worship is not belonging to some system
[24:24] or some idea of man it belongs to God
[24:29] a think of this what happened what
[24:32] happened to the coming of that stone
[24:34] brother Ram identifies this now in the
[24:37] 70th week of Daniel he specifically
[24:40] identifies that The Headstone that's to
[24:42] come on the church is the rejected
[24:46] headstone which is also the stone of
[24:49] Daniel chapter
[24:51] 2 brother Ram says The Headstone is the
[24:54] Holy
[24:55] Ghost now I'm only responsible for
[24:57] preaching what he
[24:59] said if you got different doctrine that
[25:01] I can't make it make sense to you but I
[25:04] come to a place that I don't know
[25:06] anything the message is right so that's
[25:08] right and from from where I stand I
[25:12] haven't been to a school yet to teach me
[25:14] that he was
[25:15] wrong and if I get around somebody and
[25:18] they want to teach me he's wrong then I
[25:19] just don't listen to
[25:21] them I've got that
[25:25] right see I I have a different uh I have
[25:29] a different approach you believe brother
[25:30] braham's a prophet and you preach him to
[25:31] be the truth you're General to
[25:33] me our pastor I can easily get under him
[25:36] he's a general General in the army of
[25:39] God easily easily get under him because
[25:40] he's directing it by the message of the
[25:44] hour but if someone is not directing by
[25:47] the message
[25:49] well I'm going to stay with a
[25:53] word now we're going to we're going to
[25:56] look in this and see I don't want you to
[25:57] think that I'm I'm in heresy here this
[26:01] Capstone or this headstone is also
[26:05] predicted from the scripture I went
[26:06] across this real quick the other day I
[26:08] want you to read just a moment but this
[26:10] is where in the message of Grace brother
[26:12] bradam ties his ministry to the ministry
[26:15] of zerubabel of Zechariah 4 and you've
[26:18] heard me quote it many times you heard
[26:19] Brother Ray preach on it where where
[26:21] where this is not a stranger to this
[26:22] church but zerubabel was the one who
[26:25] rebuilt the Tabernacle of Jerusalem
[26:28] after after the fall of
[26:29] Babylon when Babylon fell Israel had an
[26:32] exodus into Jerusalem and rebuilt the
[26:35] Tabernacle but he put the headstone on
[26:37] it because the Bible said when you see
[26:40] the plummet in the hand of zerubabel you
[26:42] can Rejoice because he lays the
[26:43] foundation and The Headstone because
[26:46] it's his job right he's going to rebuild
[26:49] the foundation but put on The Headstone
[26:51] so when he's finished you'll have a
[26:53] headstone you'll have an original
[26:55] worship now it's important you hold on
[26:56] to this cuz we're going to get into
[26:58] worship Worship in the future services
[26:59] but look at this because he says
[27:01] zerubabel was a great Prince among the
[27:03] people now brother bam ties himself here
[27:06] he said zerubba lays the foundation he
[27:08] has also brought forth The Headstone and
[27:10] I want you to notice he never said bring
[27:12] forth the corner he said he'll bring
[27:14] forth The
[27:15] Headstone in message of Grace brother
[27:18] bam said now if we'll think for a minute
[27:19] the seven Church age messenger was the
[27:21] one to restore the faith of the children
[27:23] back to the fathers in other words
[27:25] rebuild the church again under the power
[27:28] of the
[27:29] spirit seventh Church age messenger
[27:31] rebuilding it under the power of
[27:34] Theology and the schools and the
[27:39] system he would rebuild it under the
[27:41] power of the
[27:44] spirit message of Grace brother bam said
[27:46] according to the prophecy there is to
[27:48] come a
[27:49] headstone in in breach brother Ram is
[27:53] the one who stands there in the breach
[27:55] message and said now maybe I'm just
[27:57] feeling this way I'm going to slow down
[28:00] real slow here so you can you you'll put
[28:03] the two of these together he said now
[28:06] who is worthy to open this book or to
[28:08] loose these SEALS or the angel asked and
[28:10] he said who's worthy he said maybe I'm
[28:12] just feeling this way but let him now
[28:15] let him here is the book of redemption
[28:17] here is the Plan of Redemption and he's
[28:20] the only way you'll ever be redeemed for
[28:22] the titled Eve of redemption let him
[28:24] come
[28:25] forward let him come forward
[28:28] look what he's doing brother Ram is
[28:30] bringing forth
[28:32] something when he's opening these seals
[28:35] he's bringing forth something in
[28:37] zerubabel in zachariah's Prophecy he
[28:40] would bring forth The
[28:42] Headstone in the Bree think about it
[28:45] there is a gap between the church and
[28:48] what there had to be somebody to stand
[28:50] in the Gap to bring the church and the
[28:53] head together proving his word 1964
[28:57] brother said it would take the ministry
[28:59] of the son of man Jesus in human flesh
[29:01] to do this and he would join the church
[29:04] with the head and he called that the
[29:06] marriage of the
[29:08] Lamb isn't it beautiful the marriage of
[29:11] the Lamb he's tying it to The Headstone
[29:14] being joined together in the breach
[29:15] brother brandham is teaching this now I
[29:17] don't have time to go deep in this but
[29:19] you do know that brother brandham in the
[29:21] dedication of this the service before
[29:23] this come out late and God in Simplicity
[29:26] he said you know why I'm late he said
[29:28] just performed something in the back
[29:29] room he performed a wedding in the back
[29:33] room before he preached the seals he
[29:34] said which I think is
[29:36] symbolic to what I'm about to do now
[29:40] y'all y'all know in the Jewish weddings
[29:42] that there was a change from the from
[29:44] the uh from the relationship of
[29:46] betrothal to marriage y'all know what
[29:48] the change was when she received the
[29:50] promise of the contract and it was and
[29:52] she took it for her own that was the the
[29:55] ceiling of the marriage and here's a
[29:57] prophet re revealing the word standing
[29:59] in the Gap and bringing the headstone to
[30:02] the body look you are the hearer of the
[30:05] word he is the word and when you receive
[30:09] the word it brings the two
[30:11] together now I'm quoting brother brandom
[30:13] you know I'm quoting him amen it brings
[30:16] the two together now from that moment
[30:18] then brother Brandon Begin to say I'm
[30:20] going to declare the ministry he is here
[30:23] amen he is here I'm interested only in
[30:26] Jesus Christ he is here see he's got to
[30:28] come in human flesh and I want to
[30:30] comfort you he is here amen how many
[30:33] ever heard him say it headship is here
[30:36] see it's not coming it's here he's
[30:38] giving you this he's here now in
[30:40] Zechariah Chapter 4 read this sixth to
[30:43] sth verse and you'll pick up something
[30:45] he answered spake unto me saying the
[30:46] word of the Lord under rubel saying not
[30:48] by might not by power but by my spirit
[30:51] saith the Lord of host he said Where Art
[30:54] Thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel
[30:56] thou shall become a plain and he bring
[30:58] forth a headstones crying Grace Grace
[31:00] unto it now in the verse previous in
[31:02] sixth verse look at what he says here
[31:04] not by might not by power but by my
[31:09] spirit now go to 2 Corinthians the third
[31:12] chapter and read the 17th verse When
[31:15] Paul talks about that God would bring a
[31:18] New Covenant into the church now the
[31:20] Lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[31:23] of the Lord is there is Liberty I'll do
[31:26] it by my spirit now who whose Spirit the
[31:28] Lord is that Spirit now that one
[31:31] scripture is enough to go home and Shout
[31:33] about all day the Lord is that Spirit
[31:37] now go to first Thessalonians chapter 4
[31:39] and watch the 16th verse see the Lord is
[31:42] that spirit for the Lord that which is
[31:45] that Spirit himself shall descend from
[31:47] heaven with a
[31:49] shout and with a voice and with the
[31:52] trumpet of of God which the dead in
[31:54] Christ shall rise first now that there's
[31:56] not a question in our mind who that
[31:59] shout is this morning the Lord which is
[32:01] that Spirit would descend from heaven
[32:03] with a message of the Lord himself the
[32:05] spirit not by might not by power but by
[32:07] my spirit sayith the Lord now look that
[32:10] shout has been established as the
[32:12] message of brother brandham and it's not
[32:14] questionable this morning it's not
[32:17] something that we're going to take and
[32:18] sit down and have a have a Minister's
[32:20] meeting over it to figure out if that's
[32:22] correct we don't need to question it we
[32:24] don't need to discuss it I don't need to
[32:27] personally find it it is exactly the
[32:30] truth and Vindicated by God's word in
[32:33] this generation now that's a fact that
[32:35] the shout is the message receive it or
[32:37] don't that's a fact but what the devil's
[32:40] trying to do is keep people's
[32:41] questioning that point Amen to miss the
[32:44] next point that there's a voice of that
[32:46] Resurrection there's a voice of that
[32:49] message somewhere alive today that voice
[32:52] is not dead that voice is alive we've
[32:55] seen the stone but it grows into a
[32:57] mountain M we' seen the message but it's
[33:00] grown into a bride this is not the first
[33:03] day of this message we've been 50 years
[33:06] with a message maturing in a seed of
[33:09] life in this end time there are people
[33:11] sitting here that are the message of the
[33:14] hour from the top of their head to the
[33:16] bottom of their feet this is that
[33:18] generation which your kingdom of God has
[33:22] taken over a human body the kingdom has
[33:25] begin to progress it started as a light
[33:28] but look where it is this morning
[33:30] brother B said it come into you as a
[33:31] light and then begin to take over your
[33:33] body amen now people say well brother
[33:35] Wayne are you saying he's here I'm
[33:37] reading you what brother Ram said he's
[33:39] here headship is here the shout is made
[33:43] it is brought his presence among the
[33:45] people look at it's The Headstone it's
[33:48] the Messiah amen it's not some man it's
[33:51] the Messiah the holy spirit is the
[33:53] Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is
[33:56] the same thing and the here working in
[33:59] the flesh getting the bride ready for
[34:02] rapturing Grace there is a spirit
[34:04] working in the church this morning
[34:06] getting the people ready for the Rapture
[34:09] there's a spirit working in the Roman
[34:11] system it's the devil working in the
[34:14] system getting the people to an
[34:16] Armageddon but there's a spirit working
[34:19] in the church which is getting the
[34:21] people ready for the Rapture amen it's
[34:24] identified in Zachariah it's identified
[34:27] in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 now the
[34:30] scripture tells us of course this is the
[34:32] ministry that will unfold this is the
[34:35] stone amen the stone amen that which the
[34:38] builders disallow in Romans 9 this is
[34:41] where brother bradam reads amen a stone
[34:44] will hold I lay Zion a stone a rock of
[34:46] offense i r a Zion a stumbling Stone a
[34:50] rock of offense now we're going to watch
[34:52] the scripture in second Peter the Bible
[34:54] tells us that they will scoff amen we
[34:58] is his coming where's the promise of his
[35:01] coming they're going to scoff at the
[35:03] doctrine that Christ is descending in
[35:06] this message they will stumble at this
[35:09] because it's too
[35:10] simple they will stumble at that idea
[35:13] that Christ is coming into the Earth
[35:16] amen through the message of the hour
[35:18] they'll stumble at it they will scoff at
[35:20] it amen but until you that believeth you
[35:23] shall not be
[35:24] ashamed my brother man I was reading
[35:27] this morning ashamed message and brother
[35:29] manam tells clearly he said he said wait
[35:31] we don't have to be ashamed of this he
[35:33] said Moses wasn't ashamed to declare to
[35:35] Pharaoh that it was The Exodus time amen
[35:38] amen them men was not ashamed Noah was
[35:40] not ashamed to preach 120 years that was
[35:43] going to rain amen and the pride ought
[35:45] to not be ashamed that there's a stone
[35:48] that's come out of Heaven that has
[35:50] smashed down every Kingdom and it's
[35:52] possessing the Church of the Living God
[35:54] we are not separate from that Revelation
[35:57] this morning but it's begin to pull the
[35:59] church into itself the church is fleeing
[36:03] in Romans 9 this is when brother random
[36:05] himself comes to seeing that the the
[36:09] that the vision of seven angels coming
[36:11] to him that's what it means how many
[36:13] knows brother BR seen a vision of seven
[36:16] angels
[36:18] coming previous to that Vision it's
[36:21] called the second Climax and reproach
[36:23] for a cause for his word you can read it
[36:24] in reproach cause for a word it's it's a
[36:26] vision and he sees it and ask what does
[36:29] it mean Romans 9 tells what it means now
[36:33] it's amazing because brother brandham
[36:34] Saidi looking for an interpretation to
[36:36] come on the vision he said but no
[36:38] interpretation came because it was
[36:40] written in the scripture how many knows
[36:43] what scripture It Was Written in
[36:45] Revelations 10 veres 1-7 so Revelations
[36:49] 10 1-7 that Ancient of Days coming with
[36:51] a book in his hand putting his foot on
[36:53] left and see is also Romans the 9th
[36:56] chapter which is the the builders
[36:58] rejected amen this this message ties
[37:02] from the front of this Bible to the back
[37:04] of this Bible amen the the the the the
[37:07] scriptures that identify this message
[37:10] are Beyond infallible it's beyond the
[37:13] question of whether amen whether it's
[37:15] scriptural or whether it's not
[37:16] scriptural it is setting there the
[37:18] Ancient of Days whose garment did set
[37:20] now watch because Romans 9 amen it is
[37:23] the it is the headship can we go back to
[37:25] Daniel 7: 9 watch this and the Ancient
[37:28] of Days whose garment is white as snow
[37:31] his hair is the head of pure wool his
[37:33] his his throne as flames of fire now
[37:35] skip to the 13th verse and I saw in the
[37:38] night visions and one like the son of
[37:40] man with the Clouds Of Heaven came to
[37:41] the Ancient of Days which brought him
[37:44] near before him now can we have that
[37:46] picture of the cloud do you do you
[37:48] actually have it or is there any way to
[37:49] bring it up we showed it last week you
[37:51] all know the picture of the cloud
[37:52] brother bam amen actually in the message
[37:55] thinking man's filter he said I read
[37:57] over in Daniel the ancient of days and
[38:00] I've seen the Ancient of Days and the
[38:01] Ancient of Days is the same yesterday
[38:03] today and forever now now brother
[38:06] brandom identifies that the Ancient of
[38:08] Days that he saw out there on the mount
[38:12] Sunset is the same very thing that that
[38:16] John saw in Revelations 1 and also saw
[38:20] in Revelations
[38:22] 10 Amen brother Ram said there he was
[38:25] standing there still with r with supreme
[38:29] authority isn't that beautiful thinking
[38:31] man's filter when the angels of the Lord
[38:33] appeared out there those Seven Seals
[38:36] when the angels of the Lord appeared out
[38:38] there with them Seven Seals that's
[38:40] Romans N9 that's Revelations 10 that's
[38:44] Daniel 2 that's Daniel 7 that's 1
[38:48] Thessalonians 4 that's Revelations
[38:50] chapter 2 are you with me amen now we're
[38:54] not talking about one scripture and just
[38:56] running wild with one scripture we're
[38:57] talking about the entire Bible seeming
[38:59] its way to an event that took place out
[39:03] there and had a prophet not been there
[39:05] we wouldn't know it had brother random
[39:07] not brought it scientist took the
[39:09] picture and couldn't figure out what it
[39:10] was but a prophet took the picture and
[39:13] brought it back to a humble bunch of
[39:15] people turned it to the right and said
[39:17] it's our Lord up there amen now if we
[39:20] believe brother the random that's our
[39:21] Lord up there and we now have supreme
[39:25] authority concerning the word
[39:27] in the age we're living in now there was
[39:30] Standing There Yet brother bam said see
[39:32] when the angels of the Lord appeared out
[39:34] there and went up into the air which we
[39:36] have the picture around the country
[39:38] there he was standing there still wigged
[39:40] with that supreme authority now watch he
[39:43] is the head of the
[39:45] church he is the head of the body now if
[39:48] you ever heard me preach on the cloud Ms
[39:50] you've heard me say this there is a
[39:52] reason that it was only the picture of
[39:54] the
[39:55] face because his body was on the earth
[39:59] it was not a picture of the whole body
[40:01] of Jesus it was the face of Jesus it was
[40:04] the headship coming to the body he
[40:06] already had a body what house will you
[40:09] build me amen what place will my
[40:12] headship rest in this age if I would
[40:15] send a message will I find faith on the
[40:18] earth will I find a place for this word
[40:20] to will I find a church somewhere who is
[40:24] like a Rebecca and ready to see the the
[40:27] elaser word that'll take them back unto
[40:30] their Isaac my Isaac came to Rebecca on
[40:33] the words of elaser and then she went to
[40:36] her Isaac Isaac never came to that well
[40:40] Isaac never came to her house he came on
[40:42] the words of elaser and the spirit of
[40:45] that Camel carried her in the presence
[40:48] of him and the Church of the Living God
[40:51] has received a message in this age and
[40:55] Christ has come to us in our churches
[40:58] and in our pews and in our situations
[41:01] but it came in the word of God but the
[41:04] spirit of this message is going to catch
[41:06] up a bride and carry her into the
[41:09] presence of almighty God he's not going
[41:12] to leave us
[41:13] here this word has come to take a bride
[41:16] out of Babylon let go of Babylon is
[41:19] falling apart
[41:21] anyhow it is the head of the body now
[41:24] you see why in Christ the mystery he'll
[41:26] say that we have Satan's answer being
[41:29] identified by the original headship we
[41:31] are not looking for an answer I'm not
[41:33] digging for the answer I have the
[41:36] answer amen I have the answer I'm not
[41:39] being bold I'm telling you the bride
[41:41] cannot do nothing till she has thus
[41:43] sayith the Lord and you have thus sayith
[41:47] the Lord God sends it by a prophet if
[41:50] you don't have it he'll have to send
[41:51] another Prophet but we have it now the
[41:54] problem is what are we going to do with
[41:56] it
[41:58] are we going to are we going to bargain
[41:59] with the devil to figure out if it's
[42:01] right or are we going to take something
[42:03] we know that's right and tear down every
[42:06] devil power that comes up against the
[42:09] Church of the Living God look you got a
[42:12] token mother you got the power of the
[42:14] headship behind you when you go against
[42:17] that devil and take back that child
[42:20] you're not here by yourself all of
[42:22] Heaven is behind this
[42:24] word take your token and go after that
[42:27] devil you said brother Wayne why are you
[42:29] bringing this to the Token because it's
[42:31] an
[42:32] exodus Daniel 2 is an exodus when the
[42:35] stone strikes the church goes up this
[42:38] message has come to Rapture the bride my
[42:42] it's an exodus and in The Exodus God
[42:44] sent a prophet a pillar of fire and a
[42:48] Passover brother that was blood upon the
[42:51] door and the firstborn live what
[42:53] happened in the Bible Exodus in The
[42:56] Exodus time God struck Egypt he struck
[43:01] Egypt with judgment what happens in
[43:04] Daniel to the stone strikes Babylon but
[43:08] when he strikes it the church will not
[43:10] be destroyed in the Judgment but God has
[43:13] prepared a way that she'll be carried
[43:15] out of
[43:17] judgment God will not destroy the
[43:19] righteous with the
[43:22] wicked but that judgment Stone will
[43:24] discern who is righteous and who is
[43:26] wicked
[43:28] come on now the coming of the sun
[43:29] doesn't it doesn't change your crop from
[43:31] corn to wheat or from wheat and cuar it
[43:34] just reveals what you got and when this
[43:36] message come it didn't change you from
[43:38] church to bride or from from foolish
[43:41] virgin to bride if you're the bride you
[43:43] was the bride to begin
[43:44] with it just took the message to prove
[43:47] who you were you wasn't satisfied in
[43:50] that Babylonian system but the coming of
[43:52] this rock gave you the power to come out
[43:55] come on Church brother Ram seen the
[43:57] power Rome had and it had its bars and
[44:00] it had you locked in but a voice said to
[44:02] him amen deliver my people and he said
[44:06] House of Hell give way in the name of
[44:08] Jesus Christ and the bars begin to drop
[44:11] and let me tell you something this
[44:12] morning this message still has the power
[44:15] to destroy religious spirits and ungodly
[44:19] spirits and demons of every kind this
[44:22] message is looking for somebody who will
[44:24] believe it enough to preach it and not
[44:27] be ashamed of it but let the power of
[44:30] God come upon it in the message ashamed
[44:33] I heard brother Ram say it this morning
[44:35] he said we need a burn another burst of
[44:37] faith we don't need to apologize to this
[44:39] devil we need to tell him who we are and
[44:42] the commission Upon Our Lives amen and
[44:45] tell that devil to get out of here we're
[44:47] not going to

[45:11] Revelations 1:12 amen watch watch the
[45:14] scriptures uh uh 112 through 18 I won't
[45:18] read the whole thing but I turned to see

[45:22] turned and saw the seven golden
[45:25] candlesticks and in the midst the seven
[45:27] candles scks one like the son of man now
[45:30] that is exactly what Daniel seen in
[45:32] Daniel

[45:38] that John heard the sound a voice of a
[45:40] trumpet look at what he said I was in
[45:42] the spirit and heard behind me a great
[45:44] voice as of a trumpet but said which was
[45:46] a clear and distinct voice now he was in
[45:49] the spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[45:51] behind me a great voice as a trumpet
[45:53] look what he's doing he's in a
[45:54] dispensational change he's in the Lord's
[45:57] day amen this is not back there in
[45:59] John's day this is in the Lord's day and
[46:02] look what he says now the next verse is
[46:04] he sees one like the son of man standing
[46:07] among them now brother bam goes on you
[46:09] know in 1960 and teaches that this is
[46:11] the church he teaches that there the
[46:14] bride coming to maturity under the
[46:17] word now that picture watching Daniel
[46:20] Amen in in in uh Revelation chapter 1
[46:23] you can see it now he was in the midst
[46:25] of seven candlesticks one like the the
[46:27] son of man go to the next verse and then
[46:28] it starts describing his head his hair
[46:31] is like wo as white as snow his eyes now
[46:33] we're back in Daniel again now Daniel
[46:36] and John are both seeing end time
[46:40] events they're seeing it in the symbol
[46:44] you have seen it in the natural what
[46:47] they saw in Vision you have saw in
[46:50] reality what they saw you have seen are
[46:53] you hearing me I wished I lived in
[46:55] John's day I don't I wish I lived in
[46:58] Daniel's day I don't I'm glad I live in
[47:00] this day this is the greatest day that
[47:03] has ever been there's never been a day
[47:06] like this day there's never been a light
[47:09] like this day the reality of the word of
[47:12] God I'm not just reading it but I can
[47:14] show you a picture of it I can take you
[47:16] to a tape where brother random sat and
[47:19] communed with angels up on top of that
[47:21] mountain and come back with the word of
[47:24] God in this age to show us where're we
[47:27] were in Scripture it was an end time
[47:29] event that they were seeing amen now it
[47:32] it's amazing if you go back to Daniel
[47:34] chapter 12 can we can we can we take
[47:36] time in scripture Daniel chapter 12 now
[47:38] watch to show you that Daniel 2 is an
[47:41] end time event watch Daniel 12 and we
[47:44] read 2 to 10 and many of these sleep in
[47:46] the dust of the Earth shall awake some
[47:47] to everlasting life and some to
[47:50] Everlasting condemn I'm assuming there's
[47:52] two resurrections there and they be wise
[47:55] shall shine as the brightness of the fir
[47:57] what's that word they that be wise shall
[47:59] shine as the brightness of the firment
[48:01] and they that turn to many to
[48:03] righteousness as the Stars forever and
[48:06] ever next verse fourth and but thou oh
[48:09] Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[48:11] book even to the time of the end and
[48:14] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[48:15] shall be
[48:16] increased and I Daniel and beheld there
[48:19] stood two one of them on the one side of
[48:20] the river and one on the other side of
[48:22] the river amen now uh now in the sixth
[48:25] verse and one said to the man clothed in
[48:28] linen which was upon the waters of the
[48:30] river how long shall it be to the end of
[48:31] these wonders and I heard the man
[48:34] clothed in Len which was on the Waters
[48:35] of the river when he held up his right
[48:37] hand and his left hand unto Heaven that
[48:39] seems common doesn't it some another
[48:41] scripture like Revelations 10 and he
[48:44] swore by him that liveth forever shall
[48:45] be times and times and a half a time and
[48:48] when he shall have accomplished the
[48:50] scatter the power of the Holy people all
[48:51] these things shall be
[48:53] finished and I heard understand not oh
[48:55] Lord what shall be the end of these
[48:58] things ninth verse he said go thy Way
[49:00] Daniel for the words are closed and
[49:02] sealed up until the time of the end and
[49:05] many shall be purified and made white
[49:07] and tried but the wicked shall do
[49:08] wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[49:10] understand but the wise shall understand
[49:14] now watch what Daniel is seeing he's
[49:15] seeing end time events now brother
[49:17] Braham takes that vision of one on one
[49:19] side of the river and one on the other
[49:20] but then there's a man standing on the
[49:22] water Waters a multitude of people
[49:25] clothed in white brother br says
[49:27] emphatically that's the holy ghost
[49:29] coming on the people which is the sign
[49:32] of the end time so Daniel 12 is an end
[49:36] time event it's at the same time that
[49:39] the book is being opened amen when
[49:42] Michael stands up for his people look
[49:44] what he's doing he's he's opening the
[49:46] book it's sealed up until the end time
[49:49] now if you if you carry with me back to
[49:51] Revelations the 10th chapter there's
[49:53] that Mighty angel coming down out of
[49:55] heaven and look what he's doing in the
[49:57] second verse amen here he's coming and I
[50:00] saw another Mighty Angel clothed with a
[50:02] cloud and he had in his hand a little
[50:04] book the book that Daniel said must be
[50:07] closed until the end now he's got the
[50:10] book in his hand and it's being opened
[50:14] now watch when John sees this John sees
[50:17] this Revelation and then in the bottom
[50:19] of this verse in six in chapter six he
[50:22] said but John don't write this
[50:25] vision
[50:27] seal it
[50:28] up until
[50:31] what until the seventh angel begins to
[50:35] sound now we're seeing the seventh
[50:38] Church age messenger the man William
[50:41] brandham is on the earth at the time of
[50:45] this coming oh glory amen then in breach
[50:48] page 74 when this messenger when this
[50:51] heavenly Angel comes on the earth the
[50:54] seventh angel will be on Earth at the
[50:56] time of this coming now why does a
[50:59] messenger why does a prophet have to be
[51:01] on the earth because it's the word
[51:03] coming to the church and the word can't
[51:06] come unless there's a prophet there to
[51:08] catch it and when the prophet catches it
[51:10] look what he does he brings it to the
[51:12] church now now in case you in case you
[51:15] think I'm off on the limb somewhere look
[51:17] at Revelation 10: 7 the seventh angel
[51:19] begins to sound the mystery of God would
[51:21] be finished go to Daniel 2 and watch
[51:23] eight times in Daniel 2 the word mystery
[51:26] appears
[51:27] but it's not to Daniel 7 or Daniel uh
[51:30] Revelations 10 and 7 that the mystery
[51:33] would be
[51:34] revealed Daniel 2 and Daniel 12
[51:36] emphatically says the mystery would
[51:38] remain a secret until the seventh angel
[51:42] sounds it would be the revealing of that
[51:45] mystery amen uh uh the seventh angel are
[51:47] we all set the seventh angel is the one
[51:50] that opens that book and brings the
[51:52] Revelation let's carry on then to
[51:54] Revelation chap 22 let's go to the end
[51:56] of the matter Revelation chap 22 and
[51:59] let's look in the let's read I got the
[52:00] 10th verse can you back it up to the
[52:01] ninth verse and watch what happens now
[52:04] you'll see you'll see this happen in
[52:06] Daniel 2 as well the moment that Daniel
[52:09] reveals to Nebuchadnezzar the image go
[52:12] back and read Nebuchadnezzar bows to
[52:16] Daniel when this same Revelation comes
[52:19] to John through the seventh angel which
[52:21] what he say see thou do it not I am thy
[52:23] fellow servant and thy brother and the
[52:24] prophet and then them which keep the
[52:26] says of of the book worship God in the
[52:28] eth verse John tries to worship the guy
[52:32] revealing this to him now watch but in
[52:35] the in the ninth verse don't do it but
[52:36] in the 10th verse look what he said he
[52:38] said and he saith unto me seal not the
[52:41] saint of the prophecy of this book the
[52:42] time is at hand so in the 10th chapter
[52:45] seal it in the 22nd chapter 10th verse
[52:49] unseal it who's the angel who's he
[52:53] talking to the seventh angel is the one
[52:56] John trying to worship and he's saying
[52:58] to you don't worship me I'm one of the
[53:01] prophets I'm here to reveal the
[53:03] secrets you need to worship God and look
[53:06] what he's doing he's unsealing the
[53:08] prophecy Heen can I can I put it in our
[53:11] language it's time for the Thunders to
[53:15] thunder it's time for the seals to be
[53:17] opened up the coming of that stone is
[53:20] the end of Gentile kingdoms the seven
[53:23] seal ends all things then the mess
[53:26] message of the hour is the end of the
[53:28] devil in your life he's finished when
[53:31] this message opened up to you he's
[53:34] finished the predestination of your life

[53:40] virgin from Matthew 25 I am Rebecca from
[53:44] The Book of Genesis 24 I am the Church
[53:47] of the Living God I'm Ephesians 5 I am a
[53:50] bride without spot or wrinkle I'm the
[53:53] voice of first Thessalonians 4 the
[53:55] symbols have have been revealed unto a
[53:58] reality it's no longer in the book
[54:00] church it's in the church it's in the
[54:05] bride I don't know how to say this to
[54:07] you but God ain't coming back after a
[54:09] book he's not coming back after a tape
[54:12] he's coming back after a word bride when
[54:15] the message has come into the church
[54:18] that's what he's coming for and anything
[54:20] that's holding you he has come to break
[54:23] the power of the devil that you can go
[54:26] it's your season it's your hour the
[54:29] Thunders have thundered the seals have
[54:32] sounded the message has been revealed
[54:35] Christ has struck the image of
[54:38] Nebuchadnezzar and gave you
[54:43] Liberty we're not a part of it
[54:47] friends look at the
[54:49] deception people all the time trying to
[54:51] put the church in in Tribulation or in
[54:53] some kind of persecution you're not in
[54:55] it
[54:58] you have escaped
[55:00] it when did I escape it when you stepped
[55:02] into this
[55:04] word you might not know
[55:06] it but when they got on Noah's boat they
[55:10] got in the new
[55:12] world and let me tell you something when
[55:14] you stepped into this word you stepped
[55:16] into another dimension you never heard
[55:19] about theophanies you never had about
[55:21] five ordained virgins you never heard
[55:24] about the stone coming into the the
[55:26] church that it was laid in you before
[55:28] the foundation of the world come on
[55:30] brother man said the stone was laid in
[55:32] you before the foundation of the world
[55:35] that's the reason Christ could come into
[55:37] the church you're not just choosing him
[55:40] he's choosing you and he's ordained you
[55:44] and anointed you for the season you're
[55:46] living I tell you what we are this
[55:49] morning we are not just another church
[55:52] you're a prophetic bride coming from the
[55:54] visions of the word of God
[56:00] now in revelation 22 let's go back now
[56:04] that's that's a seventh angel doing that
[56:06] I don't think we have any confusion here
[56:08] and if you if you want to get with me
[56:09] later I can show you in Revelation
[56:11] chapter 1 it called him the signifying
[56:14] Angel and if You' like to compare that
[56:16] with brother Ram's sermons look where
[56:19] this Angel that's revealing to John look
[56:20] where he starts the deity of Jesus
[56:23] Christ then he goes to the church ages
[56:26] and then he goes to the seals and then
[56:28] he goes to the Ty together of the entire
[56:31] book look where William bram's Ministry
[56:34] started the deity of Jesus Christ went
[56:37] to the church ages then went to the
[56:39] seals and then he tied the whole thing
[56:41] together matching the same Ministry
[56:43] John's seeing here now let's go back to
[56:45] revelation 22 I want to pick something
[56:47] up here and watch in this 11th verse at
[56:50] the sealing of this book he said seal
[56:51] not the Saints and he that is
[56:54] unjust he said let him be unjust just
[56:56] Ste and that which is filthy let him be
[56:58] filthy still and he that is righteous
[56:59] let him be righteous still and that he
[57:01] is Holy let him be holy still now watch
[57:04] this the Wicked Will Remain
[57:06] Wicked and the righteous will remain you
[57:09] preach this message to someone who does
[57:11] not have a seed of righteousness and
[57:13] they will reject it every
[57:16] time because there's nothing you can do
[57:19] because Jesus said you believe me not
[57:21] because my word have no place now watch
[57:25] this I'm not I'm not trying to screw
[57:27] things down tight here I'm trying to
[57:29] show you a beautiful thing the seed is
[57:31] the seed when the sun comes it's
[57:33] judgment but the message don't come to
[57:36] condemn you it comes to reveal who you
[57:37] were to begin
[57:39] with revelation 22 watch what he says
[57:42] and he that is righteous let him be
[57:44] righteous he that is righteous let him
[57:46] be righteous watch that verse watch that
[57:48] righteous right there and when you
[57:50] watching that go over to the scripture
[57:52] in Daniel CH 12 and wor the watch the
[57:54] 9th and 10th verse and he that is
[57:56] righteous from revelation 22 go to
[57:58] Daniel 12 and watch the nth and 10th
[58:01] verse amen it's a it's a beautiful is
[58:03] this okay to read the Bible yall okay
[58:05] with this Daniel 12:9 he said go thy Way
[58:08] Daniel for the words are sealed until
[58:10] the time of the end now watch revelation
[58:12] 22 when the book's unsealed now we're at
[58:15] the time of the end watch the 10th verse
[58:17] at the time of that unsealing many shall
[58:19] be purified and made white and tried but
[58:22] the wicked shall do
[58:23] wickedly now it's revelation 22 almost
[58:26] word for word the wicked shall do
[58:27] wickedly but watch but none of the
[58:29] wicked shall
[58:31] understand but the
[58:33] wise but the
[58:35] righteous the righteous shall understand
[58:37] how do you know who that righteous is
[58:39] they shall understand they will be a
[58:43] wise virgin in the last days she will
[58:45] understand this word now I'm not I'm not
[58:48] going to take this to the intellectual
[58:50] CU brother bam tears it apart so don't
[58:51] ever take it well amen he knows all the
[58:53] scriptures and all that cuz you can know
[58:55] all the scriptures not understand but
[58:57] what we understand is like that little
[58:59] woman did at the well when the
[59:00] Vindication came to her she wasn't a
[59:02] Bible student but she believed that was
[59:05] the Messiah talking to her and she
[59:07] understood what doctors of divinity
[59:09] couldn't understand that was God dealing
[59:11] with her life and the church has
[59:13] understood this is the message of the
[59:16] hour this is God coming to our lives in
[59:20] Daniel chapter 12 if you watch the
[59:22] scripture here now of course he says
[59:24] they shall understand now now now you
[59:26] have prophecy at the time of the aling
[59:29] of the seals the spirit of wisdom will
[59:31] come into the church I love this the
[59:34] spirit of wisdom has promised to come
[59:35] into you to cause you to understand
[59:38] you're not some of us don't even have
[59:40] good
[59:41] educations some of you are not schooled
[59:43] at all but there's an understanding in
[59:46] you and that understanding is real and
[59:49] it's not the understanding of might or
[59:51] power it's by the spirit of God has made
[59:54] you understand the spirit within a man
[59:57] is the spirit of understanding now go to
[59:59] Ephesians chapter 1 and watch the
[1:00:01] promise of this scripture laid right
[1:00:03] over Daniel 12 the righteous now the
[1:00:06] wise and watch this and the god of our
[1:00:08] Lord Jesus Christ may give unto you the
[1:00:10] spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the
[1:00:12] knowledge of him and the next verse that
[1:00:15] the eyes of your understanding being the
[1:00:17] light that you may know what is the hope
[1:00:19] of his call him what is the riches of
[1:00:21] his glory of the inheritance in his
[1:00:23] Saints now in that powerful that the
[1:00:26] eyes of your understanding for the
[1:00:28] righteous shall understand the wise
[1:00:31] shall understand and you're getting the
[1:00:34] spirit of Revelation that will open the
[1:00:36] eyes of your understanding how many
[1:00:38] knows the message doors and doors
[1:00:39] brother B said the eyes of your
[1:00:41] understanding lays in your heart he said
[1:00:43] that when Christ come in he would Open
[1:00:46] Your Eyes by your heart that's the
[1:00:48] blindness of this age is it's a heart
[1:00:51] that's caused the blindness now if you
[1:00:53] go into Revelations chapter 3 from here
[1:00:56] here watch Revelation chap 3 and the
[1:00:58] Bible is going to depict to you amen
[1:01:00] that there is a people who don't know it
[1:01:03] because I am rich and increase with
[1:01:05] goods and have need of nothing and
[1:01:06] knowest not is't that amazing that the
[1:01:10] lean doesn't know in an hour of
[1:01:13] knowledge they don't know in an age of
[1:01:16] understanding in the age to understand
[1:01:19] they don't even know that they're
[1:01:20] miserable blind and naked he said
[1:01:23] preacher why don't they know because
[1:01:24] they won't receive indication
[1:01:26] they won't receive the word of God of
[1:01:28] vindication so it's left them blind but
[1:01:30] if they would have their hearts turned
[1:01:33] by the message of the hour it would open
[1:01:35] up their eyes and they would see
[1:01:37] something come on Church y'all know I'm
[1:01:39] telling you the truth if you were
[1:01:40] setting in this building this morning
[1:01:42] brother Bram said in Bram Tabernacle he
[1:01:44] said Elijah in his day had a servant
[1:01:47] with him when they seen the Syrian Army
[1:01:48] coming he said that that that boy didn't
[1:01:51] see nothing but when Elijah be to pray
[1:01:54] to give the spirit of understanding in
[1:01:56] to him his eyes come open and he saw
[1:01:59] angels and fire all around about the
[1:02:02] cabin that he was in think about this
[1:02:04] this morning if your eyes would come
[1:02:06] open brother Ram said you'd be a member
[1:02:08] of this church the rest of your life if
[1:02:10] your eyes would come open this morning
[1:02:12] to what you're in the presence of right
[1:02:14] now oh church let me tell you what you
[1:02:17] must see you can see a lot of things but
[1:02:19] what you must see is the identified
[1:02:22] presence of God in this age and you must
[1:02:24] not see him in Luther's day you must not
[1:02:27] see him in bram's day or brother bram's
[1:02:30] day you must see him in the present hour
[1:02:33] you're living is he is not a god of
[1:02:35] History he is the I am that I am the
[1:02:39] same yesterday today and forever this
[1:02:42] message has brought the same God that
[1:02:44] was with Moses and Joshua right to the
[1:02:47] age that you're living
[1:02:50] in what is it it's an after burning
[1:02:52] truth that comes into the church now
[1:02:55] watch in Revelations 3 the curse of that
[1:02:58] church was they didn't
[1:02:59] know in an hour of knowing they don't
[1:03:02] know but isn't that horrible I mean
[1:03:05] that's a that's the worst condition to
[1:03:07] be in don't know now if you if you if
[1:03:11] you like the scripture John 5 and verse
[1:03:14] 24 the Bible said he that heareth my
[1:03:17] word he that heareth my word brother
[1:03:19] Bram said believeth on him he said the
[1:03:22] correct word right there is
[1:03:24] understandeth he that understandeth he
[1:03:26] said anybody can hear it but he that
[1:03:29] understandeth watch the righteous shall
[1:03:31] understand the spirit of wisdom shall
[1:03:33] bring understanding you see what he's
[1:03:35] doing he's bringing understanding of the
[1:03:37] word into the church there is your power
[1:03:41] it lies an understanding your power to
[1:03:44] live Above This altar is to understand
[1:03:46] you were son to begin with the power to
[1:03:50] live Above This is adoption the power
[1:03:52] from being one day you're lost and one
[1:03:55] day you're saved and one day you're lost
[1:03:57] and one day you're St one day brother
[1:03:59] bram's right the next day you're not
[1:04:00] sure he's right amen one day I belong to
[1:04:03] this church and now I don't know if I
[1:04:04] belong to this church you see what
[1:04:06] you're doing but if you come to this
[1:04:08] position of understanding you'll see
[1:04:10] truth and the truth of this hour will
[1:04:12] bring you into manifestations of your
[1:04:15] life what is it amen it's bringing
[1:04:18] understanding now watch Ephesians turns
[1:04:20] into John 5 and 24 he that understandeth
[1:04:22] now watch John chapter 14 let's go again
[1:04:25] to the 16 verse John 14 and: 16 and I
[1:04:28] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:04:30] unto you the comforter and that you may
[1:04:32] abide with you
[1:04:33] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:04:35] the world cannot receive because it
[1:04:39] seeth him
[1:04:44] not
[1:04:46] neither
[1:04:48] knoweth it that something that John 14
[1:04:52] is now tied into Revelations 3
[1:04:56] in Daniel
[1:04:57] 12 knoweth him because you know him for
[1:05:01] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:05:04] let's continue that scripture I will not
[1:05:06] leave you comfortless I will come to
[1:05:09] you next verse and yet a little while
[1:05:12] the world see me no more but you see me
[1:05:14] because I live you shall live also and
[1:05:17] this is a famous one in the church and
[1:05:20] at that
[1:05:23] day the day when the Revelation is made
[1:05:26] known the layad Deans know it
[1:05:30] not but at that day ye shall
[1:05:33] know oh Church you're not children of
[1:05:36] Darkness this
[1:05:38] morning this is not
[1:05:40] sneaking this is not sneaking on the
[1:05:43] church but it's the children of
[1:05:45] light what is it it's actually the time
[1:05:49] when the church should
[1:05:51] know you should more than anything you
[1:05:53] should know where you belong
[1:05:56] you should know your position in Christ
[1:05:58] you should know this is the message of
[1:06:00] the hour you should know I am a part of
[1:06:03] that Daniel 12 righteousness maybe maybe
[1:06:06] maybe in your personality maybe in your
[1:06:08] situations you fail but that faith is
[1:06:11] always existed there is something in you
[1:06:15] that in the low moments of your life
[1:06:17] you've knew it's right when you couldn't
[1:06:19] point to your own ability you could
[1:06:21] point and say I know this message is
[1:06:23] right when things are falling AP heart
[1:06:25] in your life and and this person goes
[1:06:27] that way and that person goes but
[1:06:29] something in you said that's still the
[1:06:31] truth I can't help it because something
[1:06:34] in me has given me an understanding that
[1:06:36] God has visited me listen I pray this
[1:06:38] morning that the reality of this
[1:06:40] scripture breaks over our lives that God
[1:06:43] has given unto us this age an
[1:06:45] understanding in this word for the
[1:06:48] season that we're living and by this
[1:06:50] exposure of the devil brings the church
[1:06:53] exactly where they're supposed to be in
[1:06:55] the word
[1:06:56] you see what it is Satan is here in
[1:06:58] Matthew 24 the Bible said that that that
[1:07:01] this spirit will be so close that would
[1:07:03] deceive the elected if it were possible
[1:07:07] it would deceive if it were possible I
[1:07:10] love brother Brandon when he says that
[1:07:11] he ties together then he said elected
[1:07:13] means election he said then if you have
[1:07:16] elected he said you cannot be
[1:07:19] deceived isn't that beautiful then the
[1:07:22] spirit of delusion will come in the
[1:07:24] loudness in ag but you will not be
[1:07:27] deceived false prophets shall come but
[1:07:30] you will not be deceived false teachers
[1:07:32] will come but you will not be deceived
[1:07:35] what is it God has given to the church
[1:07:38] an understanding to lead them
[1:07:40] out my when I think about the grace of
[1:07:43] God that has come to lead out the church
[1:07:46] you see every time God does something
[1:07:48] Satan does something at the same
[1:07:50] time every time every time God does
[1:07:53] something Satan does something at the
[1:07:54] same time and when God opened up these
[1:07:57] seals Satan come out against it with a
[1:08:00] Lies when brother brandham said it means
[1:08:02] this and it means this and it means this
[1:08:04] Satan come out against it with
[1:08:08] lies he does it every time now watch
[1:08:11] watch watch the if you watch the
[1:08:14] scripture all of those kingdoms come in
[1:08:16] one is that right all those kingdoms
[1:08:20] come in one but it's just the power of
[1:08:22] God that destroys those
[1:08:24] four when you go to the Book of
[1:08:26] Revelations the 6th chapter the horse
[1:08:28] riders all gather together but there's
[1:08:31] only one Eagle that reveals the whole
[1:08:34] thing the eagle reveals it to bring
[1:08:37] light to the church now to think this
[1:08:39] morning that there is a spirit in this
[1:08:42] age of
[1:08:44] delusion that has beg to lead this world
[1:08:47] to an
[1:08:49] Armageddon friends this is no joke
[1:08:52] people are going to go to an
[1:08:54] Armageddon
[1:08:56] I know that sometimes when I was young I
[1:08:59] I heard uh ministers Minister and it
[1:09:01] made it sound like the bride was going
[1:09:03] to Armageddon but let me tell you
[1:09:04] brother Bram announced the greatest
[1:09:05] battle ever fought it's going on
[1:09:10] now Armageddon that you're going to see
[1:09:13] you're seeing right
[1:09:17] now we're not going to be here for
[1:09:22] arm the greatest battle that was ever
[1:09:24] fought already been water it's fighting
[1:09:26] right now brother way when that pressure
[1:09:28] comes it's
[1:09:30] here sure the squeeze is already
[1:09:34] on pressure is already
[1:09:37] there I don't think I'd have to preach
[1:09:39] on that this morning I think anybody in
[1:09:41] here can testify truth
[1:09:44] quickly sure it's already it's already
[1:09:47] in the midst of the church now every
[1:09:51] time in Revelation
[1:09:53] 16 watch the scripture I want won't be
[1:09:55] much longer I hadn't been very long to
[1:09:57] start with but I won't be much longer in
[1:09:59] Revelation 16 watch the scripture
[1:10:02] because the Bible said in the 13th verse
[1:10:05] I saw three unclean frogs like out of
[1:10:07] the mouth of a dragon out of the mouth
[1:10:08] of the Beast and out of the mouth of the
[1:10:09] false prophet for there the spirits of
[1:10:12] the devil working miracles go forth
[1:10:13] under the kings of the earth and the
[1:10:15] whole world to gather them to the Battle
[1:10:17] of that great day of the almighty
[1:10:18] Revelation 1613 and 14 so what brother
[1:10:22] Ram says is whenever the seals are
[1:10:24] revealed
[1:10:25] that's when the frogs come
[1:10:28] out so he says what it is is they're
[1:10:31] Looking Backward to those
[1:10:33] trinitarian
[1:10:35] doctrines so brother Bram went in and
[1:10:37] taught the truth of godhead and they
[1:10:39] look back to see what somebody taught in
[1:10:41] a future age or a former age so when
[1:10:44] they looked back they looked back in
[1:10:46] their teachings and then they refused
[1:10:48] what the message was bringing and it was
[1:10:51] a spirit of the lying devil to lead the
[1:10:55] people people to an
[1:10:56] Armageddon because had they believed the
[1:10:59] message it was the spirit of
[1:11:01] truth leading them to a
[1:11:04] Rapture listen friend this morning I
[1:11:06] believe that there is a spirit released
[1:11:09] in the church today that is leading the
[1:11:12] church unto the
[1:11:14] Rapture and being that is leading it's
[1:11:17] the
[1:11:19] head this message is the head won't you
[1:11:24] stand to your feet with us toight
[1:11:36] today this
[1:11:39] word is the head to the
[1:11:43] body what an hour to live
[1:11:46] huh never been a time
[1:11:49] friend never been a day like this one
[1:11:52] can you
[1:11:53] imagine living in a
[1:11:56] season that Daniel was
[1:11:59] seeing that John was
[1:12:01] seeing that Paul was seeing and every
[1:12:04] one of them
[1:12:06] longed to see this
[1:12:08] day and then there's so much pressure on
[1:12:12] us there's so much pressure on us that
[1:12:15] we look back and say I wish I had lived
[1:12:17] in another
[1:12:20] day friend you're living in the greatest
[1:12:24] day
[1:12:25] amen but you got to break out of
[1:12:30] it you got to break out of that anxiety
[1:12:32] and depression and those little isms and
[1:12:36] situations
[1:12:40] and you see what God is doing he's
[1:12:43] leading right I just love the scriptures
[1:12:47] the way it's written because the Bible
[1:12:48] said that John was in the
[1:12:51] spirit on the Lord's day that's this day
[1:12:57] all this
[1:12:59] darkness and I can point you to a
[1:13:01] scripture that said it was possible for
[1:13:02] a man to get in the spirit of
[1:13:04] Revelation isn't that beautiful John
[1:13:07] never recorded all the problems of that
[1:13:10] season he recorded the revelation of
[1:13:13] Jesus
[1:13:14] Christ cuz I want to tell you this
[1:13:15] morning where you're going to find power
[1:13:18] is in
[1:13:20] Revelation Revelation is a prevailing
[1:13:22] power over your life come on when you
[1:13:26] when you
[1:13:27] know you're standing there this morning
[1:13:29] you've born of a woman and every man
[1:13:32] child every person sitting here is a few
[1:13:34] days and full of trouble you're full of
[1:13:37] mistakes you got a cuckle bir nature
[1:13:38] there's a seed on the inside and Paul
[1:13:40] said the things that I want to do I
[1:13:42] don't the things I don't I do so I find
[1:13:45] something that is true evil is always
[1:13:47] present with
[1:13:49] me now I don't want to shock you but
[1:13:51] brother Bram said that's the one on the
[1:13:54] outside see taste smell feel and hear so
[1:13:58] there's an evil one wherever you go
[1:14:00] whatever you do but there is another man
[1:14:02] in
[1:14:03] there and he was ordained before the
[1:14:05] world ever began and when this message
[1:14:07] comes over you it opens the eyes of that
[1:14:10] one that's in you that is
[1:14:12] greater
[1:14:14] hallu there's a son and daughter in
[1:14:17] there on the inside of you and this
[1:14:19] message has come to Quicken that and to
[1:14:21] feed that and establish that and put you
[1:14:24] in a position
[1:14:26] where you can stand right here this
[1:14:28] morning and with all these troubles
[1:14:30] going
[1:14:32] on you know exactly where you are and
[1:14:35] where you're going what a prevailing

[1:15:04] power it's in
[1:15:07] Revelation can we just bow our hearts
[1:15:09] this
[1:15:10] morning I wonder brother Braham said it
[1:15:13] like
[1:15:14] this that we should pray for Revelation
[1:15:17] more than we do anything
[1:15:22] else it was written in the scriptures

[1:17:57] see has
[1:18:00] never been
[1:18:04] alive that
[1:18:06] shine so so
[1:18:11] bright as this
[1:18:14] day this
[1:18:15] [Music]
[1:18:18] Glory
[1:18:22] Day
