it's just been exploding in my heart and I pray that it be a help to you and amen uh um uh so we're we're certainly thankful uh Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 11 down to verses 15 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now brother Brandon calls those angels in the pulpit and he said they're standing right next to God and he again says that it is the highest form there is to hear from God amen amen and now they're giving for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of faith and un the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man the cunning craftiness whereby they lay and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love yes may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated this morning and I want to speak to you just a little bit today if I take a context over this I want to talk to you about the perfecting of saints about the perfecting of saints now one thing we uh have established and if you were with us in the last series uh moment we were talking about the ministry of the New Covenant and we were talking about the moving from an old Covenant to a New Covenant we're talking about moving from law to Grace we're talking about moving from carnal Commandments to the spirit of the Living God we're talking about a Messianic Covenant of where the that the Old Testament Covenant was unto the Jew and it was unto the Seed of Abraham naturally speaking but this New Covenant was unto every part of the human race through all the nations of the earth thy seed shall be blessed so it was a blessing unto all of them and we're finding that the that the word in the book of Hebrews being a key chapter the book of Hebrews was a chapter that was going to separate law and Grace it is a key book in the Bible uh it was where Paul took the Old Testament law and begin to divide it and show you what it was coming uh Paul tells us here of course that we're looking for perfection in Hebrews chapter 7 he says that if there be a Perfection were under the levitical priesthood under it the people receive the law what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of mezc and not be called after the order of Aaron now we're going to talk about perfection and if if Perfection would have been under the other priesthood there would have been no reason for him to speak of another because it would have been complete or full it would have been enough but because it wasn't enough there had to be a change in priesthood and the Bible says for the priesthood being changed then there is a necessity also of changing the law so if you have a change in priesthood then you have to have a change in order or it didn't do any good because the old priest under the Old Law could not bring Perfection to the people but he's saying there is become a new one a necessity a changing of the law this is evident that God has designed both the law and the priesthood to introduce Jesus as the priest and only sacrifice and he's taken and taken the gospel system and placed it in the place of the law and the and the Old Testament way of doing things so what we find then is that our lord Jesus gave us a place at the altar where we had no place for it was only the levite only under the son of Aaron were allowed to come into that place but here there was by oath of God that there would be another priest arise after the order of MDC and that he would not be of the tribe of Levi but he would be of the tribe of Judah is that right now and and when you study the tribe of Judah it's very powerful because that tribe was the one that Caleb got into wasn't it it was the tribe of Judah where his possessions were it was the tribe of Judah Caleb was a gentile and found possession in Israel under the tribe of Judah amen that tribe of Judah was where Rahab found her place in the Covenant was under that tribe of Judah and under the tribe of Judah is where the spiritual Seed of Abraham would give a blessing unto all the nations of the Earth would be blessed unto the tribe of Judah so For unto them things were spoken per pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar it's evident that our Lord spring out of Judah which Moses spoke nothing concerning the priesthood it is yet more far evident for after the similitude of mcedc there arises another priest now watch the beauty of this who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment other but no no law made Jesus a priest he wasn't born right for it he wasn't in the right tried for Moses's law but after the power of an endless life then his priesthood was not a law his priesthood was the power of an endless life and that is the calling of every one of this five-fold ministry under the priesthood of mecdc that we have been empowered by the power of endless life there's no there's no denomination somewhere that's saying that we can preach the gospel there's no headship somewhere there's no big church system set up somewhere that says we can preach the gospel but we preach it under the authority and the power of an endless life not of carnal Commandments see we're not under denominational ages we have come under the power of endless life there is a priest Forever After the all after the after the order of MDC the law amen therefore verily disannulling the Commandments before the weakness and the unprofitable thereof so if they're no good they're disen alled they was not profitable for the law could make nothing perfect but the bringing of a better hope which we draw nigh unto God that's why he says in Romans 8 that the the weakness of the law he says he couldn't do it because the law was weak through the flesh so as long as there is a flesh there's going to be a weakness and the law could never perfect you because it was all done in the flesh that's why in Hebrews 10:4 amen Paul said it is impossible somebody say impossible it is not possible amen that the blood of goats can take away sin it's not possible amen and it's not possible that you can quit smoking and take away sin or that you can quit gambling and take away sin or you can join a church and take away sin or you can shake hands and take away sin or you can be the member of a church and take away sin there is only one way to take away sin and that is by the effect the power of the blood of Jesus Christ the son of God that shed his blood for every man woman and child sitting in this building it's not for just a Jew it's not for just the servant it's not just for the male or the female but it's for every bit of the human race that God has called to the authority and to the power it is not possible for it to do it but God has made this possible amen that he has taken away the first and established the second that's why it says in Hebrews 10:14 for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified now watch this by one offering he has perfected forever that is the key verse of perfection for the church for by one offering Heath perfected see if we have a perfect sacrifice then we have Perfection if there's no perfect sacrifice there is no Perfection but we have perfected forever come on by that sacrifice so then what we then therefore find is we find the words of Our Lord in Matthew 5 and 48 is both a command and a promise be ye therefore perfect even as my Father in Heaven is perfect there's your there's the requirement Perfection which of you can obtain it come on now amen get your bootstraps and pull yourself to the Moon let the leopard lick his spots off he'll only make them shine brighter amen but what we found amen that the word of the Lord included both command and promise when he said be ye therefore perfect he has got to supply a way of perfection if God requires it he's got to provide it because man cannot obtain Perfection he bled thousands and thousands of gallons of blood trying to wash away sin and he couldn't do it but in one offering our lord Jesus perfected forever them that are Sanctified the subject is perfection brother Ram says it per the position of believer 1955 if you like to study these sermons this is a good one for you 1955 the position of a Believer the subject is perfection that's his words he he said how can a mortal man ever become perfected see see yet the word said that he chose us to be holy and perfect before the foundation of the world Ephesians 1 amen now how you going to do it Jesus even said be perfect even as our father in Heaven is perfect now if God before the world ordained that you should be holy and Without Blame and perfect in the sight of God and we are struggling and we are murmuring but don't you think God seen all these things come on right amen amen and he fornew it and he predestinated and he ordained it us to be so elected before there ever was formed now here's the power of this that you were perfected before you began so God perfected you in eternity and let me ask you this can you change in time what God did in eternity no but what we do find is that we struggle and we murmur and we wonder how could this be but see God commands it and he also promises it by his command if it's calling un Perfection he has to provide the Perfection if we need a perfect sacrifice we had none he had to provide perfect sacrifice in Hebrews chapter 6:1 Paul says it beautifully let us leave the principles of the doctrine of Christ and let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works in the faith toward god brother man breaks into this and he said quit doing what man can do in other words dead Works Amen in other words man can work you can do a lot of Works amen but if them works are dead they don't bring life you can just keep doing the right works and it won't be right you see a man that's unsaved you can do all the works right but you're still a dead man he remember if a man ever gets life and gets perfection in him then his Works become Perfect by the one that has perfected him listen he said let us go on un Perfection I don't know about you but that's where I want to go I want to go on unto Perfection amen now watch Matthew 5:28 again he said see then therefore there is a Perfection and brother bandam says that perfected forever then we are then perfect through Christ we are free from judgment through Christ we shall never die through Christ we have lost we have lost death and found life through Christ not through any church not through denomination not through any fantastic not through speaking in tongues not through shouting not through shaking not through dancing in the spirit but by Grace God calls you who he will and it's all by election Oh Glory to God then you want to shout a little while don't you because see it's by election and when you learn it's by election and it's not by works brother get out of my way just get out of my way cuz I'm going going to Perfection and there's nothing that can stop the Church of the Living God because Perfection is their calling it's the it's the calling it's a promise it is a destination of the bride and God himself has come to lead us and guide us unto Perfection Perfection is where we're going God calls us and it's not him that willth and it's not him that runneth but it is God that shows his Mercy if you're going to get Perfection you're going to have to get man out of it cuz there's no per man as a perfect God so the only way to bring Perfection to the church is move on from the dead works and get to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and where Perfection can come into the soul amen it does away with the old and it brings a new it's not just a new Leaf or turning over it's a new birth a new creature a new creation yes sir right old creation has the same nature is that right uh me and brother gorb was walking the other day long the creek and I was just talking to him about raccoons and trapping raccoons and things and I said the thing about a raccoon is nature never changes see so you can accumulate deception you can accumulate how to trap a raccoon because from generation to generation you can get smarter and smarter he don't move he's the same creature so you can you can advance in your deception of that creature but if you're if you're talking about an otter he don't trap the same as a traps right so you take about a human being the Satan has been compiling deception to trap human beings since the beginning of time and he's getting better and better and better and better at it matter of fact by the end time the Bible says It'll be such a deception that the elect will be deceived if it were possible but it's not possible see because there's another life in there there's a gene in there that's another creation they have Theos or deity inside of them so when you take a nature change you're no longer just a human being with human nature now you're a Divine being with divine nature and you react differently than other people react because it is a change of nature is that right it's a nature of God so don't act like a human because you get trapped like a human right now now somebody said brother Wayne do you believe in New Birth of course I believe in New Birth it is the first Doctrine Jesus ever preached yes sir and he didn't say you should be born again he said you must you must because it's got to be creation you must be born again we have some of our our friends here from Pennsylvania this morning amen and God is that you Johnny amen I like that haircut God bless you amen amen but but they were in the house the other night and was it in your house Johnny amen he would called me the other night he said brother Wayne something's just happened here now you know that the Amish wouldn't have electricity back there in Pennsylvania amen but there was something happened back back there they were all in the house and even mom and dad was outside and there was a voice spoke out in the home that was the same voice that you would hear on the tape and it said be born again you must you know you know friend when God begins to deal with somebody he begins to deal with them and it's not him that willth nor him that runneth but it's when God begins to call amen when the Holy Spirit begins to draw and the Bible said no man come unto me unless my father draw them but when God begins to draw them there ain't enough Devils there ain't enough tradition there ain't enough family there ain't enough trouble but by Grace God begins to call a man he's going to bring them to Perfection it's Perfection let's go let's drop our bags let's drop our popcorn let's get aside and let's get on this train of perfection it's moving into the promises of God God Amen that's what it is amen what is it amen you're getting in the body of Christ now here's the thing this entire chapter of Ephesians had been dedicated from the beginning to the Saints which are at Ephesus sir Saints right the Sanctified ones brother brandom says this is not an Evangelical book this is a book of positioning right to the Saints which are in Christ Jesus now how are you going to to get into Christ except you be baptized into that body 1 Corinthians 12 the Bible said by one Spirit we're baptized into one body and that being the body of Christ to be a saint see people say well you know St Cecilia or Saint uh Joseph or there's all kinds of sainthood and we were actually walking and found a little thing to the saint of bicycles I don't know who that is bicycle rares guess but everybody's got a saint you know and and we were I guess they've been around a while I don't know but but everybody's got a saint you know and that's the problem brother R said the problem is is people are praying to Saints but they they don't get to be sainthood till they die he said but we believe in Saints which are alive the Saints which was living in Ephesus because when you commune with dead people it is communing with dead it is witchcraft it's witchcraft folks to to deal with dead people amen now now watch this because somebody said to brother brandom they said but you talk to Jesus he said but brother he's not dead that same Jesus we're talking about is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he rose up on the third day and appeared unto his disciples and he spoke to them of the kingdom of God what I'm telling you this morning is you can talk to Jesus all day and all night he is a saint but he's still alive he's still still alive and to them that are Sanctified listen you can't get into heaven without Perfection now I'm tell you you can't get there brother B said the shadows of things to come subject Paul is speaking Perfection and God requires it no one can ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect you must be perfect yet the scripture says None is perfect well there you go you're locked out there you go you got to be perfect and none of you are that locks it out so if you must be perfect to come to heaven and the scripture said none is perfect we've all come sinned and come short of the glory of God how we ever going to get into God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires Perfection Jesus said in the sermon be you therefore perfect even as my Father in Heaven that God requires of a person is perfection that's what he requires but the scripture said be you perfect but listen how you going to do it brother Bram says how can you do it how can you be as perfect as god is perfect now we're not talking about kind of perfect we're talking about like perfect perfect we're talking about God perfect but that was a commission or a commandment by Jesus Christ in heaven was to be perfect you say then who can be saved he said hold on a minute and let's find out how Perfection is made goe sir how is perfection made then brother brandom goes all the way back to eternity and he says all the way back there there God foresaw through the streak of time and knew he would have a remedy to save those that were desired to be saved so he says Perfection didn't begin here Perfection began there amen and when God seen you in the heavens he said listen if you desired to be saved he said God had to make a way for you to be saved so he literally how many knows when he slayed the lamb he slayed it before the foundation of the world right do you know the prophet said that he spoke your name when he spoke of the lamb and he said you were associated with the lamb in him before the foundation of the world and your name was written and recorded on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now that's a powerful thing because if you're in the Lamb's Book of Life Now get me you're not going to join the Lamb's Book of Life you were in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and the Lamb's Book of Life amen is only names right somebody say only names now now you say preacher why is that important because there's no box beside it for your works there's no there's no place to add your like if you ever filled out something and you run out you got a long name like mine it's a bunch of letters and there's no more room in the box and it's just your name and amen you maybe want to put something else but there's nothing there it's just your name and God just put your name in the Lamb's Book and there's no Works beside it somebody said well what what are we going to do in judgment that's just it the bride never goes through judgment there's no reason to have works with a name there's no judgment to the bride for them that have heard the word of God believe the word of God has passed from Death un life and shall not come into condemnation well Glory I Think It's Shouting Time to know that God has put us somewhere can I say it to you he put you high and dry and there's no priesthood there's no doctors of divinity there's no theologians can take you out if God put you in brother thank God this morning you can't blot my name out you can't add sin to my name I'll give you scripture who can bring anything to the charge of God's elect they were elected before the foundation of the world the blood of Jesus covered it Sanctified them and perfected them by his own atoning offering so only can you come this morning either you're going to bring your works or his works but if if you're going to bring one of your works you got to bring all of your works so I don't want none of my works I want the work of Christ because I was condemned at my birth but by the grace of God I've had another [Applause] birth brother you can't help when you're born that you were born into genetical imperfections you know some of you some of you got all kinds of genetical imperfections and you were born into that and you're no more responsible for that than the man of the Moon you were born into that well why can't we have genetical Perfection right amen come on now spiritually speaking you've had a new birth but when you were born again you were born of another parent and there is a perfect genetics in God I'll tell you what that now listen if there had never been sin you would have been born perfect in the garden y'all know that come on now but the devil got in and brother Bram said the Perfection chain was broken right and God invented time right and it was for the devil so in this little hickey of time Perfect Circle broken Perfection remember Perfect Circle broken and a hickey of time came down and God let them and he calls it a time space so that time space is like just a you have a perfect circle and then there's just a little hump down at the bottom it broke Perfection but in that little space now we're going to call it 6,000 years but in that little 6,000 year space something's going to happen in there what's going to happen in there the prophet said that's where Redemption takes place that's where Redemption place takes that's where you learn he's a savior and he's a Healer that's where you learn what kind of God you're serving and you see the glory of God the power of God and brother B said someday he's going to pull it back into Perfection again and that'll all be done away with so in the eternities you'll know what he is to be a savior but you won't remember the sin you'll know he's a Healer but you won't remember the sickness now now look look at the power of this you say what happens in see that element of time it is an imperfection and we're all in in Perfection because of that element of time but the element of time is what makes you realize Perfection do you you know that your arch enemy is the devil did I need to preach on that or you you you good with that how many knows he's your enemy he's not your friend even when he's friendly he's not your friend he's your enemy all the time that Devil's an enemy to the Church of the Living God but that devil was in heaven your enemy was in heaven and your enemy would have always been there except God made this little place of time and in that place of time the enemy your arch enemy will'll be destroyed forever you tell you today that God's going to annihilate that devil because he's not a part of the original Perfection he's going to be destroyed now what that really means to you is that there is a place in your new birth to destroy your enemy amen now it's a great chain of perfection and it's coming down through there now it's the it's it's questions and answers 1964 brother brandom they ask him should we we come to the church for Perfection should we come in in one place should we listen to the tapes and things for Perfection and brother BR said well you're going to get fellowship with one another at the church but the perfecting comes between you and God the blood of Christ is what perfects Us in the holy spirit so preacher what are you getting at let's look at this sin's judgment the Judgment of sin this day you should die is to take life now notice how people now can look and see that how we believe so supremely in the blood of the Lord Jesus why do we believe so supremely in the blood of the Lord Jesus because it's the only place to take away sin right amen see it's the only Perfection for the church let me just let me just continue in this and say this that if you're in the blood of Jesus brother R said I used to think it was Jewish blood I used to think it was a gentile he said but then one day I saw it was the blood of God I seen that the Supreme blood of the Lord Jesus is the blood of God now you see what he's saying in the exposition of the church ages brother Bram said since it's the blood of God then it is a perfect blood my goodness then it is a perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin it is loosing perfect perfect and complete now now it's beautiful brother Josh gave me a good definition the other day I was preaching on that uh go into the world and preach to every creature that creature you kind of wonder what that is I've wondered what that was I don't know why I didn't have had seen the definition he was just looked the definition he said brother Wayne did you ever see this and it just said creature anything under bondage anything that is is being bound I'm I'm paraphrasing the definition but that's what it meant so so so the preaching of the Gospel is to liberate people who are under bondage now listen there's no greater bondage than religious bondage when religion takes a bind and holds you they hold you by fear that if you don't step to their tune if you don't join their church if you don't go and hear their preacher if you don't do it this way you don't do it this way they control your eternal life let me tell the devil and all of his angels God gave us eternal life the word promised us eternal life and the new birth guarantees us eternal life come on church amen I'm I'm not breeding Rebellion but I'm telling you this we'll not hold still for a religious spirit to bind us constrain us hold us this gospel promised freedom and brother it's Freedom we'll have Give me liberty or give me death there's not one part of this message we are scared of there's not one part of this Bible we are scared of I thank God this morning I can report to you that we can use this entire Bible and it is good for Doctrine and instruction and correction we don't have to come through here amen and say oh we can't use that one and we can't use that one and we can't use that one no sir this is the age of the full word every book of every part of this book is good for Doctrine and instruction come on Church let's just keep them moving and so is the message of the Hour come on you're not going to go through this message with me and say you can't quote this part and you can't quote this part and you can't qu this part listen amen the next time I hear that I may take a series on the part you tell me I can't quote come on church we won't we won't we won't be bound amen we won't be tore down we're going to be liberated in the presence of God Amen the Rapture may take place in the [Applause] morning wo since it's the blood of God it's a perfect loosing the loosing is complete and perfect now there is no more condemnation gone amen who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect I love how brother Braham said don't you get tied down to no tradition create an organization don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word of God am and deny Jesus saves he heals he fills with the Holy Ghost in power you are God's free man man perfectly free in the Holy Ghost you are God's free man loosed by his own blood now watch this if you still hold to your faith to Creeds and denominations it is certain by the evidence that you lost your faith in the word so even in that freedom if you if you if you hold to the tradition then by that evidence you're denying the word itself that is liberating you amen I'll tell you this amen I will not deny this word if it says I'm free if it says I'm perfect I say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord cuz you know something about me I don't know about me and you've done something for me that I couldn't do for myself so last thing I'm going to do is take it out of your hands I'm going to give my perfection to him and I'm going to worship him every day and thank him for the good in my life I think somebody ought to worship him right now amen amen I think we ought to I think we ought to give praise for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I think we ought to give praise for The Liberation sister Megan thank God that God still comes in the midst of church and heals and saves and delivers I praise the name of our Lord Jesus for his mercy and His glory when Josh told me that testimony I about shouted in my truck I said glory to God that's it amen when you break the spirit then there's liberty in the heart amen I pray this morning God break every Spirit of bondage every Spirit of Oppression and tradition and allow his children of Liberty in God there's nothing so beautiful as the taste of Freedom amen I know I'm not a c Civil Rights Movement but I'll tell you this it was another I I just remember Martin Luther King sping out them great words free free at last thank God we are free at last but was they free was they better come on now they got tied up again in racism and and ideas and and and come on even being free they still have great complexes that are holding them in that kind of mentality in the civil rights in this age I refuse to turn around having been liberated and go back to denominational bondage and denominational ideas of prophets stood on the platform and said you're free you're free you're free you're free and I say thank God I'm free perfect perfect blood so God is a spirit and he overshadowed Mary and created in her the blood cell that brought forth the Son of God and through his blood we have access to life and our sex ual blood is dismissed hallelujah hallelujah amen I've had people come to me say brother Wayne I wasn't born right my I come in an illegitimate family and I seen the questions and answers and I was curious whether I could even be in the Rapture because some things that was said there and then I've heard preachers use it and I've been worried and I've wondered hey man let me let me give you good news they brought that question to brother brandom privately because of sister Dalton had come from that same kind of home and she said brother bandam does that mean I can't go in the Rapture and he wrote out a letter back to her and said sister we were all illegitimate children under Adam but Jesus by the new birth made us legitimate listen to me we were all bastard born but there's a legitimate promise of a new birth and when God gives birth to somebody they are legitimate and he dismisses the sexual birth so let me dismiss it this morning morning that curse of sugar diabetes is dismissed this morning that heart disease is dismissed this morning that stubbornness and temper and Malice and envy we dismiss it this morning by the new birth we have a new genetics brother listen one of these mornings this Soul's going to break over this body and there'll be a [Applause] change dismissed oh thank you Lord Jesus the prophet dismissed it our sexual blood is dismissed Perfection holy completely in Jesus Christ the book of Ephesians it's not an Evangelical book it is a book of positioning and placing it is a place to grow the church into a maturity that you know who you are you know what you believe you know what you stand for and you're able to withstand the enemy because of the maturity in your life listen this is the thing this book is not addressed to unbelievers it's to the called out to the Sanctified and called ones in Christ now as you reread Ephesians 4:12 it says for the perfecting of the Saints now let me just rephrase this for you what it doesn't say the perfecting of Sinners this is the perfecting of saints the five-fold ministry all right now watch there is a there is a compound we know the atonement brought the birth the atonement brought the Perfection but now to the Saints he's talking about perfecting them what is he talking about go ahe how do you perfect a perfect people I just spent 30 minutes proving to you you're perfect Beyond doubts and Paul to them same people is now saying perfecting so this must be something besides the English word that would give meaning so it's amazing if you go into the Greek here amen it's it's oh I can't pronounce Greek but it's a card cardos it's C it's k a k t a r you got it oh there it is you can just read it everybody that can read yes sir we can get Nathan to pronounce it go ahead amen but it means perfecting but complete Furnishing equipping so what we're doing in this church amen you people get saved they get birthed under the preach and the atonement and they come to perfection but when you come into a new birth of perfection God has got this fivefold to equip you he's not equipping you in natural things he's equipping you in spiritual things now what kind of equipment would God give his church brother B said when it come to war he said the devil is getting the best equipment he could get and he advances in Warfare every year he said but God doesn't Advance he was perfect to begin with so he gave Adam and Eve the word in the garden and he said it's the word is the best weapon we have to equip the church with so what the fivefold is to do is to equip the church with the word of their age that they might be able to bring to an adulthood those which have been born into the things of Goden listen when I look at this this morning you see there's a Furnishing or an equipping of the believer this refers to the restoring of anything to its place putting it in order making it complete my goodness when I look at this see Christians may have every possible advantage of becoming complete in love and in knowledge isn't that amazing amen that you that you come in you become perfect in your birth your soul is saved it's completely done but you approach something in your life and you don't know how to approach it you come up to something you say well I'd like to do this but I don't know how so what you have is someone equips you to bring you to the position in your life where you can handle things as Jesus would handle them I think it's powerful this morning he didn't only perfect us in our birth he put us an instruction over our life to teach us train us to move us forward in his mercies listen amen Christians amen it gives you an advantage see it brings an equipment under your life it is an equipping so that word that I just gave you starts with a K there amen y'all forgive my inabilities the only time in the Bible that this Greek word appears the word perfect perfecting Perfection appears many times in the English but the meaning behind it this is the only place in the Bible it comes in the perfecting the equipping of the saints of God now what's amazing is the next vers is also use this uh uh use some explanation watch this next verse uh go to Ephesians 4 and let's look in the 13th verse look in the 13th verse of Ephesians 4 if if I hadn't got you too messed up amen um I've already shut this portion I'll come back to it here Ephesians 4 and13 till we come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man now isn't this amazing because now amen this perfect man here now give me the Greek on that one brother but y'all didn't know you coming to Greek class did you now they got a different Greek word for this word Perfection now we're at tellos that they all think that can we agree that's okay that's hillbilly for greet teos Man full age yeah brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness perfect that which is perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of men full grown adult full of age mature now come on y'all Y y'all carrying babies with you right now but you still teaching them how you still teach them how to get dressed how to tie their shoes how to say their ABC you're teaching them how to respond how to socially but that's been a perfect baby since it was born it's a perfect human the moment it has life it's a human being it's perfectly a human but it's not an adult yet come on so you can't just get born again and set it home and say well I'm coming to be perfect there's an instruction of the word of God that instructs a man how to be an adult how to be a mature son what he supposed to do now watch this the next verse in Ephesians 4 and verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children right now watch this tossed to and fro carried by every wind of Doctrine slided men and cies that we be no more children now we're going to get another Greek word one more it's a it's it's it's it's a it's a beautiful little word in in the in the Spanish I think they call it Nino or baby what's a baby in Spanish you know it's almost neee poost how y'all like that overnight Greek Theologian knee poost child babe childish an infant a little child a minor not of age childish untaught unskilled untaught see the powerful thing is that the the that the the Bible is laying out Paul is laying out the idea that Perfection is through the atonement but this five-fold ministry is going to equip the church and bring them from untaught children to mature Sons and Daughters of God Amen what is it it is a perfecting it is a referring to of bringing this life now here's the thing it's unto the perfect man watch this under the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ if you're going to tell me Perfection I got to know your measurement amen if I say to you she's a perfect wife who's measurement that's a perfect car whose measurement amen some of y'all think Ford's are perfect three Sundays in a row come on guys but see what I mean now I would never unless it's the Shelby but but I would never think think it was perfect but to the man that loves it that's perfect to him it perfectly fulfills his vision his dream his ideas not perfect to me amen and you see that Perfection is relative to the one who speaks a Perfection so when he statues when he draws him out God don't God don't have Paul pick Moses up and say until you come to a perfect man like Moses until you come to a perfect man like Paul until you come to a perfect man he says under the statue of the measure of the fullness of Christ can I say it unto the personality of Jesus a training listen if you would have been born in the Garden of Eden you would have had his personality back there but you wasn't so you had to have a new birth and when you got a new birth now you're passing through the word because you bypassed your theophany up there and you don't know how a son acts you don't know how a son talks and you don't know how a son does things but we're now walking through the message of the hour being developed into a full maturity of a son and daughter of God that you can stand in this earth and know exactly who you are where you come from what is taking place into a personality now it's promised in 1 Thessalonians 4 a person would come the personality himself now watch these two Greek words and I'm just going to take for a moment NE is it knee poost can we can we use that and and tellos so in Hebrews 4:12 for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which to be the first principles of the Oracles of God and become as such as having in need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness he is a babe knee POS be not children this is now calling babe but watch 14th verse but strong meat belongeth to them that are of a full age now that is the Greek word amen tellos so it could just as well say to them that are perfect even those by have reason of use their senses exercise to discern good and evil so what he's doing is he's building the principle to you that there are young Christians and there are adult Christians perfection in Christianity is maturity it is an adult Christian it's not that you don't make a mistake it's not that you didn't have a struggle or you had a bad attitude or you didn't do something right that's not the Perfection he's talking about that Perfection is in the blood of Jesus he's talking about come on to adulthood amen eat the word of God and manifest the word of God grow up into all things which are in Christ he's talking about being the teaching of the word now in galatian chapter 4 amen it says it clearly now I say that the heir as long as he is a child in OS same Greek word child babe as long as he's a child he differed nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but he's under the rers and governors until the appointed time of the father somebody just say appointed time we'll get to it in a minute appointed time amen now watch this even so when we were children we were in the bondage under the elements of the world so he's talking about again knost now in 1 Corinthians 14 and 20 Paul said Brethren be not children in understanding but in Malice be your children but in understanding be men now watch what we're talking about when you get converted there is a button about brother bam says a button of light about the size of your B uh your shirt button he said that enters into that converted man when he's born again he lets that Spirit grow and take out all of the root of bitterness and it God presses his way through him back in the same condition that he was in the Garden of Eden all the way to Mark 11: 24 if you say under this mountain can you imagine and he's telling you now that there's something about the size of this button's going to come in you but when it gets in there it's going to take over that when God's holy ghost gets in you it's going to take over listen when you go out here in the spring of the year now I'm I I got to I see things simple you go out here in the spring of the year there's no tree leaf removal fellow God don't have Angels come out of the heavens put ladders up against the oak trees and get up there and pull the old oak leaves off of the tree but somehow the oak Le gets off of there it's because under the spring of the Year there is a resurrection power of new life begins in that tree and when New Life Starts putting on it pushes old life off so that old dead leaf just falls off and a new leaf takes its place listen Christianity is a growth and when you get born again all you got to do is start eating and drinking and growing eating drinking and growing eating drinking and growing and after a little while you'll push malice out you'll push jealousy out you'll push that part out that old dirty thing will go away that habit will leave you won't have hunger for this or hunger for that and after a little while you'll turn around and say what happened to me I'll tell you what happened it is a progression of your faith from Glory unto Glory we are changing by the word of God being equipped hallelujah hallelujah amen it's the growth of it see you're maturing you're growing when you ought to be teaching teachers you're still babes having need of teaching but watch something in you growing out pushing out making bigger it's the Holy Spirit the new birth is a born from the outside you're born from the inside out it grows it lives listen when the birth is on the inside shouldn't it grow and when Christ is in your heart it should be growing daily getting bigger more powerful understanding forgiving walking as God would walk until Christ is formed in you am let me give you a part of this one Christ growing in you growing out malice taking it out of you pushing it out God comes in pushes it out how little juvenile little things how much kids to argue and fuss but the first thing you know it just grows over the top of it ain't got no more room for it oh I like that don't you amen when we ain't got no more room for that thing it used to hate it we used to hating things but I just don't pay any attention to it anymore see you're growing now y'all know there's growing pains and I'm not going to preach on it but brother Ram goes into it right here when you're growing there's growing pains and sometimes we have growing pains in the church but listen that's all it is it's just a growing pain don't don't don't get shook up don't get troubled amen you're growing you've got to have adversity to grow you've got to have opposition to grow you've got to have opportunities to grow listen don't look at everything comes your way as it's coming to destroy you my God made the furnace and the fire and there is no weapon that is made that can destroy the Church of the Living God this Affliction is not to destroy it's to refine you it's to grow you it's to make you a son who knows where he standing can I say this the greenness gets baked out of you you're laying under the sun the presence of God is making a mature child out of you you don't respond like you used to amen amen because you're growing amen what is it brother bam says it like this Christ comes into the heart and then he comes out of the mouth he comes into them eyes he comes into that mind he comes into that mouth you'll talk different you don't talk like you used to Christ got in your mouth done gr now from your heart you love him and you'll Bridle your tongue the next thing you know it grows into your eyes and you find out the old lustful things that used to look at you turn your head then the first thing you know amen you turn your head but you're thinking and after a while it grows into your mind and you don't think about it anymore and then it you just get to be a great big boy then and you're coming into a full matured man living for the Lord he so then you are Christ you are a new creature now watch this Paul is talking about to this Hebrew church I got some things about mecdc I'd like to tell you but can't tell you now because that you are babes yet in the word he said but their strong meat belongeth to them that are full age yall know what that is it is a prophecy of an end time Church there is coming a mature Church in the last days according to this pyramid that brother random draw us it will become in a minority but it'll have greater power than any part of the church that's ever had she'll speak where he speaks she'll live where he lives she'll come into the image of God Amen let me tell you the Church of the Living God is growing up in Christ can I say this to you we are not in the foot age we are not in the knee age or the hip age or amen we're not even in the mouth age we're not even in the eye age we're in the mind the Divine intelligence of God has come down into the church she knows what he wants done with his word he's sharing his mind how does how does a how does a grown man share with a three-year-old how to build a house how do you teach your three-year-old how to how to lay the roof and how to I can't even get it good how 412 I know what it means but I have no clue how to get it amen how you going to explain that to a three-year-old God wanted to share eternal life and how could he share eternal life with Adam but he said through the Tree of Life when it become mature it would produce fruit and that fruit would mature in a certain age I I pray I didn't get too deep into that but you see what I'm saying there's got to be a sharing of life there's got to be a sharing come on now you if a grown man's trying to share his life with a three-year-old something's wrong with that man come on so God is not trying to share his life his kingdom with an immature church but he said it's the father's Good Will to give you this Kingdom because there's got to come a full mature bride in the last days there's been brides and brides and churches and churches but there's coming one that'll be a mature Church she'll be a bride Church she'll take every word she'll walk like him talk like him speak like him act like him flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power so brother Wayne how far you think we come it's in your lap how far you think we come we are here we are here let me say this we are not in Paul's age this is the last age this is the age that they without us cannot be made perfect but Perfection has come adulthood has come the message has come come on I I'll go to the scripture with you Hebrews chapter 12 says it he said you ain't come to the mountain that you can't touch right remember the Blackness and the law and even a even a lamb or a goat or an animal touch that mountain had to die how else and a man himself couldn't go in the presence of that God but you ain't coming to that kind of mountain Paul said you come unto Mount Zion Hebrews 12:22 and un the city of the Living God unto a Heavenly Jerusalem into an accompany of angels to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven oh my to the god the judge of all watch this next part and to the spirits of just men made and to the spirits just it actually translate righteous men made tellos when righteous men become perfect when righteous men know how to walk and how to talk and how to hold the word of God listen you might have whipped this bride when she was an infant but this is not an infant bride Church she knows this message listen our children knows more about the word of God than theologians that are living in the sanctuaries amen what am I talking about a top church I'm talking about a word bread word top word born Holy Ghost fil Church of the Living God Amen to the spirits of just men righteous men made mature right that's where you have come you have come to maturity that's where the church has come to in the age we're living it is opposite from a little child listen let me let me just say this what did Noah reflect and what did MO Moses reflect and what did David reflect I tell you what brother Ram said he said it reflected the coming of a perfect bridegroom amen David was reflecting one was coming cuz he wasn't perfect and Moses was reflecting one coming cuz he wasn't perfect amen you see but they were saying there's one coming that will be perfect right amen right and brother brandom says watch this now and Luther reflected something and Wesley reflected something and Pentecost reflected something they reflected the coming of a Perfect Bride come my goodness think about this this morning can I say this to you I don't care how you feel the alpha has become the Omega amen let me ask you who has the right to announce Perfection is it is do do do I have the right to look at you and say well you're perfect listen the only one that can do that is the author of you no different than it was with Michelangelo when he was building his Moses amen he said it was perfect the one that was creating it said it was perfect listen and it is per perfect when the Creator says it's perfect and here we come to this age with a season of perfection with a prophit office of God to announce perfection in an age amen let me say say this to you perfection in the wheat field is when the seed comes to maturity perfectly wheat it's not husk it's not Chuck it's not stalk it's seed Perfection right now in the Old Testament you know what they did Brother Levis they took the sheath waving of the of the field and they would take the first mature seed they take a they take a big bunch of what they believed was perfect seed and they' take it unto the to the levite and they would call a wave offering and they would wave that sheath before the Lord and the sheath would be accepted as mature grain then the whole field it come out of was accepted with a sheath offering the prophet of God said there's got to come a sheath offering in this bright age there's got to come one to maturity and somebody said well Christ is the sheath of course Christ is but we're talking about Christ getting in a human we saw him do it in a virgin born body okay amen we saw a man born of Virgin we saw the sinless Perfection we saw how he acted we saw how he walked but the promise is the nature that's in him would come into my bride in the last days so we see a man William brandom come to the Earth and he's born of sex and he's got issues and he's got troubles but God made a promise Perfection was going to come upon the Church of the Living God so God God picks this man up and begins to wave him before the world and say this is what maturity looks [Applause] like and if there was a mature son in our age he has announced it is the age of maturity the seed has come the seed again I wish I had a way to explain it to you but there's seasons of your crop and you look out there and everything's putting on leaves and then you see a season everything's putting on shuck and then you see a season when seeds and never shook and you see it's the seed age now it's the seed time now well if there was a mature son in this age it was an announcement brother Larry there's a whole field full listen there's a whole field full and you might not think much of yourself but the god of heaven sent a message to declare she has reached perfection in the word of God nothing else to add amen amen four said preacher what are you talking about for an appointed time it's necessary help me preach for an appointed time Galatians 4 as a child until an appointed time what happened in that time father take the boy out and he' stand in the public and say this is my son and he's good for it my words his word appointed time do you know the scripture declares appointed time do you do you see the prophet in the breach and until you that studi the message you'll catch this and I don't have time to preach here but in the breach brother bram's talking about the aling of Seven Seals and he said that they stayed a secret until an appointed time right amen just like Jeremiah's documents stayed in an earn vessel until an appointed time time and at the appointed time the Earth and vessel carried the message of the inheritance and the Church of the Living God has been looking for its inheritance and here the appointed time is when the seventh angel messenger an Earthly messenger comes to the Earth he's carrying the inheritance of the church somebody said well God don't heal no more but we've seen him do it God don't have visions anymore but we've seen him do it amen God don't raise the Dead anymore but we seen him do it we saw a man born like we were born use the word and create a squirrel and speak to the lame and they walked amen and he was so powerful that he controlled the greatest creature of him all his own flesh woo you talk about maturity friends amen maturity has come upon us and the Bible said don't seal the Saints of this book for the time has come can I say it openly to you the Thunders have thundered the seals have spoken God has sent a message maturity has come to the church and I receive it I receive the headship of almighty God upon the church I say this to you maturity has come now what's amazing in Revelation 10: 7 in the days appointed time in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God would be finished the Greek word Tello it means what has been promised has been executed it means it has been accomplished it means it has been performed it means time has expired for the prophecies they're now in effect the finishing of the church is app point to the time of the seventh angel messenger and when he begins to sound Perfection will come upon that church that hears it amen I amen I I I've got a lot laying here and I won't get to all of it but I want to take you to the scripture 1 Corinthians 13 and: 10 amen but when that which is teos when that which is teos is come that which is in part shall be done away what need is it when Perfection comes watch what he's saying when I was a child there it is I spoke as a child understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man do you see what Paul Paul's saying it clearly to you when that which is perfect has come now we're correlating the Perfection of the church with the appointed time of Revelation 10: 7 brother Brandon correlates that with the appointed time of adoption we are at the age of sunship listen this is the age we're living in it's the age not as a child now watch this this is this is not a rebuke if you're if you're an infant in the message that's not what this is it's telling you the potential of the age you're in now watch this because you no longer speak as a child an untaught one see if if let just say you was living in the days of Martin Luther and and and I was a preacher in the days of Martin Luther what would my sermon sound like right a child because that was all that I could operate under could there would be no more understanding to the church than what Martin Luther gave me so a five-fold Ministry could only grow the church up to the Statue of the age he was living in but then we find out the scripture tells us that God is progressing the church from childhood to maturity that's why we didn't stop with Martin Luther right amen just shall live by faith but the Bible also says that we're Sanctified by the word and it also says that you've got to receive the Holy Ghost what is it it's moving into the adulthood of Christianity oh Church of the Living God that's why we don't stop halfway that's why we don't stop in the middle when I was a child I understood as a child I thought as a child I became a man but now we see through a glass Darkly but then shall I know even as I've been known now what are we talking about we're talking about maturity coming to the church can I say this to you God is making a masterpiece again sir and when that Masterpiece comes into his Perfection this bride will fulfill everything in the New Testament now that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's a perfect word Perfection of what I'm speaking of was not obtainable in another age Perfection is not attainable under your Baptist preaching it's not obtainable under Pentecostal teaching it is only obtainable when that which is perfect has come listen I'll tell you what brother brandom says he said it's a perfect place you're going to it's a perfect Son of God you're being married to and how are you going to do it in any other way than the perfect perfect word now we're talking about perfection now some people would look at this bride and they don't see Perfection matter of fact they see imperfection they see Fanatics and crazy people and they see every kind of issue and they look at brother Ram's teachings and they see this problem and they see that problem but Perfection was being given according to God and that Perfection is calling on the church and somebody is going to begin to see this now watch this next verse I'm just going to be closing in here now watch that 13th and then move into the 14th verse and watch watch the scripture how it begins to translate and now about uh sorry not 13 uh Ephesians 413 and watch how the scripture begins to progress and bring the church from childhood to maturity and look at the result and we come into the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of Christ now that's the book of Peter you all know that and we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of man the cunning craftiness whereby they lay and wait to deceive next verse but speaking the truth result of adult Christianity speaking truth in love let me ask y'all something what is the Capstone of your life Divine love now watch brother Bram coming into his own Ministry in 62 switching to 63 and brother Bram said I'm coming up to a Jordan now and a man comes up and prophesies over brother brandham yeah amen and he says unto him that you have chosen the harder way and because of this momentous decision you have made you will receive a greater you got a greater greater reward in other words you've received this it is a victory in love divine what was his victory folks brother BR comes back and he says now I don't really know what that means I know the choice part but the victory part I don't know right now he said maybe we'll get to it in the tent and then he comes back just a little later in Paradox and said here's what it means it means that we have come up to the Jordan Pentecostal age we've come up to the Jordan and I've looked over there and saw he said now a highand would turn around at this bank and go backwards because you're about to receive rejection for what's coming so he said look it was love that made me go over there into those seals it was love that made him preach the truth to the people when he knew he would lose people by the thousands but but love forced him to do it adult Christians speak truth in love it is the victory of your life it is the grace of your life this message must be preached it must be preached into every nation it must be preached to everyone but love must take it there love must take it to your family Love's got to take it to your home Love's got to take it to your church Love's got to take it to your neighborhood listen it'll have to be the truth in love and if you speak the truth in love love Hornets will go back in their nest and Bulls will lay down under the tree if you speak truth and love cancers will fall off in the middle of the service if you speak the truth and love demons will be broken Powers will be shattered young people will be filled with the Holy Ghost when I was a child I spake like a child it was full of denominational nonsense but when we come to adulthood speaking the message of the hour with love knowing what it will do for this church let me say something to you this message is riding the trail again and if you're going to follow that Prophet it'll be a harder way but it will evolve into speaking truth in love can our musicians come it will evolve into speaking truth and love can I say it to you Christianity adult Christianity is perfection yes sir speak not like children like men do you see that speaking like men adult knowing who you are knowing what your dimensions of your command knowing the The Authority that you carry it wasn't until Moses perfected his Masterpiece that he struck it and commanded of it to speak Perfection commanded speaking he struck it brother B said there it is that's the mark of the Masterpiece because it so matched His Image now now watch this this leay out is seean age he was never put out until perfection in Isaiah 53 it says he was smitten of God in Revelations three it shows you the bride will be smitten out of Leota to speak to speak God's truth in love am how you going to speak that truth bound up with denomination how you going to speak that truth truth when you can't quote this part you can't quote that part I'd like to preach about this but I can't do it because all of my friends there's no Apostles over this church folks what the message says is completely accessible and liberating in this building do you see what we're do you see it is the truth in love amen that is where we have come to yes speak yes speaking to your mountains this morning speaking to your situations this morning you may have things going on in your life today and you say brother Wayne what I do you're not a child you're not serving some Stone Idol you're a daughter you're a son of the most high God and you have an authority to speak to the situ situation that's in your life and say look Mountain get out of my way you have that Authority amen can you stand to your feet with us this morning I'm sorry if I've been a little long speak speaking the truth in love is isn't that amazing it's right there in that scripture what what does Perfection mean to you coming to the place to speak truth and love God needs the truth spoke amen and he's capping lives to do it thank God today thank you Lord Jesus thank God today it's a powerful morning in God we believe it amen you got something I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every
