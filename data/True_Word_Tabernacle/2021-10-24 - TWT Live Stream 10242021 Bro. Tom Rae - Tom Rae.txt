this morning do you got heaven on your mind oh i tell you you know i just can't quite get it off mine and uh you know sometimes i get up saying everybody gets a little nervous and anxiety and whatever but i just kind of want to thank brother ashton for kind of stepping he just got anxious right there i want to mention his name but for forgiving his testimony about having anxiety and uh you know a lot of times things will get on your nerves and the devil he just kind of gets on your nerves and sometimes you got to shake him off a little bit and the holy ghost has a way of doing that um the other well maybe a couple weeks ago i was just sitting there at home praying and i thought god you've saved me you've took me away from the things of the world you've brought me into the truth for my day there's many truths out there but none that's going to rapture us out of here except like this one and i said lord oh you give me good parents that raised me right never heard a cuss word in my house even me and my brother might say oh just a bye word and he'd say boys now that's just the same as saying the other you know so quit saying that and um but i just thanked him for all that he had done for me and then i got to thinking lord is there anything i could do for you anything i could do for you that you don't already got have you ever tried to buy somebody a christmas present that has everything you know don't buy from my parents you know you gotta really think about that lord's blessed them but um but i was thinking lord is there anything i could do for you and there's nothing i could think of and all at once i remember hearing brother uh margolis well margolis he always corrects me said there's no r in my goalless right sister and and so anyway i heard him saying up here one time he said you know i love my children he said and there were some people come over and blessed my children and they gave him a gift and he said you know it was more important to me made me feel better that they gave my children a gift than if they would give me the gift personally and so i thought well maybe lord that's what i could do for you maybe i could bless your children with a song and if i could bless your children with a song maybe i'd be blessing you and you know brother anxiety it's just here it just has it's it's got its place you know but sometimes singing is healing um this song about saying i don't really know the the title of it i just call it the bride song and i was sitting here eating lunch with brother terry tidwell one day there are murphy's brawl and i said who who even wrote this song he said i think his brother lineal yachts had wrote this but it's called the bride song and um i just think of uh back when people came out of the denominations and came into this truth how that they were so excited about this message they just wrote about it and there's so many songs but i'm just going to try this for you i pray that it'll bless you i think i've talked enough to get my anxiety down just a little bit so lord let me sing the brightest song [Music] oh to this world the bride has never looked so defeated while waiting for a promised rapture it seems so long [Music] we've been struggling through this world we're gonna make heaven our home so lord let me sing the brightest song [Music] oh let this song be something about this message lord christ the mystery of god revealed o the seven seal desperation the token leadership and the future home so lord let me sing the brightest song well i've always wanted to do something special for you lord oh but what could i give you lord that you don't already own [Music] oh but what i do for your people i do it for you lord so lord let me sing the brightest song [Music] oh let this song be something about this message lord christ the mystery of god revealed o the seven seed desperation the token [Music] leadership and the future home so lord let me sing the brightest song [Music] oh let this song be something about this messy lord christ the mystery of god revealed o the seven seal desperation the token leadership and the future home o lord let me sing the brightest song lord let me sing oh i just want to sing oh lord let me sing the brightest song amen god bless you [Applause] give f amen he pulled that one out from a long time ago remember some of you should have remembered that i think if you was raised in the message and you listened to tidwell's or lenio yawn say man you remember that one brother jim oh yeah amen lily of the valley let your sweet aroma fill my a share and show me how to grow in beauty in god's side make me a reflection of your life [Music] down on me let your love shine through me in the night [Music] anywhere you open up the doors [Music] let your words speak through me show me things i've never seen before [Music] lord i want to be a witness you can take what's wrong and make [Music] i it jesus sign down on me let your love shine through me in the night lord i see a world that's dying by the master of deceit groping in the darkness haunted by the years [Applause] [Music] then i see you standing near me shining with compassion in your eyes oh i pray jesus shine down on me let your love shine through me in the night [Music] anywhere [Music] [Music] let your words speak to me show me things i've never seen before [Music] lord i want to be a witness or you can take what's wrong and make it right [Music] shine through me in the night holy spirit reigns down [Music] how we need your touch again holy spirit [Music] let your fire fall let your voice be heard come and change our hearts as we stand on your word holy spirit [Music] hallelujah let's stand and sing it holy spirit [Applause] [Music] comfort [Music] hallelujah [Music] won't

honor brother erickson i always do with wayne brethren to be able to look into the faces of the blood washed and redeemed of god one day we will be together around the throne of god rejoicing lifting

at your redeemed and know that these are your lambs these are your sheep these are the purchased of god and lord we would never want to hurt one of them tender shepherd chief bishop of our souls would you come through the word this morning and speak individually to us from the youngest to the oldest we love you with a very great love we thank you for every member in particular each one has a part in place within this great body called the bride of jesus christ and so father i'm asking as we look to you the word that you would come out of the pages of that word and lord would you open the book

thank you for your specials thank you for your love and opening your heart to me it means so much in this crazy dying age that we live in and we rub shoulders with well let's turn into the bible let's turn to revelations chapter 22 and as you're turning i do want to thank our dear brother ray for the invitation to be with you brother erickson thank you so much it means so much to me and to see a friend's old friends i saw brian lucille in the back and i ryan you'll never know what you meant to me at a time of great crisis you were there i've never forgotten it and never will and thank god for you it was very special not just to me but to my family it meant so much thank you thank you so much amen you have wonderful friends and when you have friends like this through the years they're they're cherished they are cherished and i i deem it a great honor to be able to minister with great men i'm nothing we're nothing no i'm a i'm from a little hiccup called chilliwack and you can hardly even spell it when i was a kid it's an old indian town i grew up in the called the fraser valley in british columbia and since a little boy wanted god i wanted god i i don't know where that comes from until this message came then i know where it came from my mom my mom and dad were not believers whatsoever lovely people probably the finest parents outside of being christians and uh christmas i got the wrong gift yeah i wanted a fire truck and i got a dump truck but it was hydraulic it was the first hydraulic dump truck i think a kid ever got but they had friends over and all around and of course my little sister she got a nurse's kit you know they got she looked like a nurse right and they said oh tom are you going to be a construction worker when you grow up a policeman or a fireman like a little truck you got there i didn't know when i grow up i'm going to be a preacher and they looked at me and they said where'd that come from i didn't know until later on i got i was saved at 21 and my mom you know we're sort of that british background you have sunday dinner at two o'clock sharp if you're not there at two o'clock sharp you can get the wrath of evelyn ray and uh she was doing okay she's peeling carrots and your sister joanne like your wife came into the kitchen and she turned around she said well and only one person on earth calls me this tommy my name is brother tom i said mom when do i get to be called tom she said never you're always my tommy i said mom i'm 60. come on well she said honey you remember when you were a little boy and you're just a four-year-old boy and you said to me mom i'm going to be a preacher someday she said i remember that i feel humbled to say that and i'm not a preacher when i see these preachers preach i'm surely not a preacher i was reading that quote where brother brown talked about he was on that corral and this guy said i'll give you 50 bucks to ride this horse and he said he was all dressed up looking like a cowboy and his horse got jumping and dancing around and bucked the guy off and threw him off and the fellow that owned the horse said anybody here the attorney said brother he looked right straight at me are you a cowboy you want to ride he said no i'm no cowboy and i hear brother wayne priest brother ray preacher i'm not a preacher i just put my shoulder to the wheel okay that we're here to enjoy the word of god this message that god has given us we're the most privileged people on the face of the earth and i want to give you greetings brother erickson from brother biskell especially to give you his love and greetings to the church and to your pastor and he loves you dearly and i feel privileged to be able to say that and we thank god many saints back home know many people here and so i'm broadly saying god bless you from the saints in cloverdale to here all the way into ohio so we love you we thank you for the light that's still shining they're not going to put this light out no how no way and we're going to preach this message until it's until we're raptured amen and we do indeed love it and i don't know what i would be today without it i don't know but i know one thing i'm a son of god and i know that by the grace of god so we're standing here this morning not to be some buddy i'm just the brother just here to help in any way i can and i don't even know why but brother ray put it on his heart the lord put on his hard work here and i feel a grand privilege to be with you so without any delay please as we've turned to revelation chapter 22 i would like to read from verse 16 and 17. verse 22 i'm sorry chapter 22 verse 16 and 17. the scripture reads i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that have thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely let's turn now to first peter chapter 1 i have my button done up on my coat i do that for a reason the reason is i'm i'm just going to be nice and kind when i unbutton it you know there's a change okay so i when you say but tom you got your button on i got my button on i'm just gonna be a little more what do you say not reserved just a little bit more you know less animated okay first peter chapter 1 verse 23 please we can start at 22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of the corruptable seed but of the incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word i want you to take a look at this verse please but the word of the lord endureth forever i'd like you to take a special note let's i'll reread that for you please but the word of the lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you god bless you all have your seats please vermin domini you see brother tom where are you going already can i i'll start it again i'm speaking latin and probably not very good latin at all but i googled it to see how to say it verbum domini menet eterna verbum domini minet in term the word of the lord endureth forever that's what it means in latin now how many know where that slogan came from or that verbiage came from not only from the scripture but when the reformation started and the words started to unfold in its justification this is what they put on their swords on their sleeves on their breasts on everything the word of the lord endureth forever and no pope no pope no bishop no cardinal no nothing is going to start stop the word from being preached for the word of the lord endureth forever it doesn't matter how many spirits come against this message the word of the lord endureth come on say it to me the word of the lord endureth for forever and ever and ever because the word's eternal as we spoke on last night so if you want to learn a little bit of latin you just write it down verbum domini minette etierum boy i went to church and learned something today and that was all free say son did you learn what brother tom said this morning yes mom vermin domini mineta turned the word of the lord endureth forever mom it does indeed but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound that sounding could only be the word of the lord endure forever god had to have a messenger for that word to come forth because satan in all his weaponry has deadened the word has made it meaningless but there is a life that comes with the word and you have to walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of jesus christ cleanses you from all sin so then you can say as the word of god walks in the light as he is in the light as you walk in the light as he is in the light then the word of god endures forever so if it did something for one it will do it for another very simple right god changes not and um how many have ever heard hebrews 13 8 in your life somebody around yeah we have hebrews 13 8 and we'll rattle it off jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the word of god endureth forever how many times did the prophet say yesterday today and forever how many times have you heard it i'm just setting you up you know i've got my button up see and then some people are saying keep the button on how many times was a reference that jesus christ was saying yesterday to them forever how many times have your pastor mentioned ministry of mention how many times have you read it in the message book and how many times have you read it in your bible and yet we still don't seem to fully come to grips with the impact and power of it if he was a deliverer with moses he's a deliverer today amen if he kept the death angel at bay in exodus he'll keep the death angel at bay today [Music] why because the word of god endureth forever so whatever you read in genesis you can read in revelation whatever you see in deuteronomy you will see in revelation whatever you see in all the books of the bible because the word of god endureth forever he showed himself as victory he showed himself as niecy he showed himself as the mighty god has he changed why the word of god endures forever is that true and he's the same what yesterday today and forever is that true is he a savior did he save you did he save you did he deliver you did he give you the holy ghost that he still saves he still delivers and he still gives the holy ghost [Applause] so we see in the scripture we we see how god moved and we read it through the gospels and we marvel about the apostles you know the apostles were just like you and me they were just like you and me we we we start raising them up and and god god we give them honor due to hey the lord jesus picked them out and won a devil but he also picked you out so he's the same yesterday today and forever and when we still have sons of thunder huh we still have sons of thunder and still got mothers saying can they sit on the right hand my son's better preacher than your son i still got the button huh huh is that true can you imagine the other apostles saying who do they think they are they even got their mom involved come on you know we see you know we see the super part of it but let's just see the natural part of it and then we can start to see ourselves in it and that's why brother braham said there was peter the boisterous one you know and then you got andrew the prayer warrior you got everybody has their own personality and everyone was needed in the body and so i'm looking at a church today that is needed for this body and don't send your mother up to me and tell me how great your sons are you're great because god chose you you mean i'm great yeah you're very great so we're going to look at the subject this morning we'll just take our little bit of time and if time goes on and your roast burns blame me i'll be flying out tomorrow but as at home over this type of season we do have one service on our sunday so we take our liberty and the pastor said i could so i'll take my time by god's grace so now here we here we find ourselves reading this scripture i jesus now i jesus who which we found out in the in revelation chapter 1 that he which was which is and shall be he was the one which was dead and is alive forevermore he's the great i am and so now we find then the book of revelation is the bride's book because of who he is he's the bridegroom we've come from the bridegroom we are the bride so now he's personally writing at the very end and showing us the uh showing us that how close we are he said i jesus sent my angel to the churches and then the very next verse says and the spirit and the bride say come so there comes a time that we're going to say everything he said we have to say everything our husband says and everybody starts to think well brother branham said say what i say of course because it was god speaking through the man and the spirit and her bride say come because the word of god endureth forever and so whatever that word of god is we must believe it a lot of times and because there are some many of us some are just a little bit more charged up than others and we all get excited and we get caught up in one another's excitement but we need to get caught up in him caught up in the word you know as as paul said if you pray pray in the spirit if you walk walk in the spirit sing sing in the spirit you get you know and it's so easy to type that so naturally because if i if if it was the world series and tickets were smiling at 500 a piece and all of a sudden your boss gave you you know box seats you know you wouldn't be sitting around saying oh i just got a boxing plan i know hey guess what you're going to tell your friends your family everybody else that you've got a special seat to the world series but i want to tell you there is a throne and that's a very special seat and to them that overcome will i grant you sit with me in my father's throne and i'm looking at the owner of commerce and you have a special seat so you do have something to rejoice about this morning i've already been prophesied to overcome you're not a failure you're a winner you're an overcomer satan i put you under my feet get behind me it's already been prophesied it's already been spoken soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side hi that's what's happening people are looking for an event when the event is taking place oh i'm looking for something some saints i just want to tell you this morning we're already in it for the lord himself shall descend with a shout with a voice with a trump of an archangel brother bram said he does all three as he descends so don't look for a rapture just start realizing you're in the rapture and that's why the devil fights you so much and that's why we need to preach the word because the word endureth forever oh no i haven't done this in a long time no you're gonna see my tummy isn't it marvelous we can come to church rejoice in what we believe knowing we are the elect see gene of the living god i've come from god i go back to god so now we're in we're in a cycle saints it cannot be stopped and we don't want it to stop so now we're in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mistress of god shall be finished because the word of god endures forever we understand then that the word of god unfolds let's turn to matthew 13. matthew chapter 13 verse 37 matthew 13 37. now you start to understand well as we get into it an invisible union when a prophet can speak out and say prophetically because he's seeing it in that world he's letting you know i hear the combines coming so he's preaching that in 1965 and here we are in 2021. so now we start to understand then as that word has come throughout the ages down to this time that there is a people that are coming to its ripening because the combines can't come until the seed is right and let me tell you wherever god is is a bumper crop he doesn't ever have a crop failure never a crop failure every crop jesus has is a bumper crop amen so in verse 37 it says he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed who's good you might as well just say it and jesus said there is no one good but god hello didn't we get did you get it last night i got it i've come from god i'm going back to god you're as eternal as god is so that good seed had to come from the good husbandmen we're a part of him we're not rich young rulers don't get then get your mind confused nobody's good hey people say i'm just not worthy really did you read the message it's called the church age book in the church age book he says you're worthy because the worthy one says you're worthy [Music] can you go with me on this you know what worthy means axiom that's what worthy means so in axiom means scale so when jesus stepped on the scale he doesn't have an imbalance scale he has a balanced scale so the worthy one stepped on the axiom or the scale so the bride steps on the other side and she's even equal come on equal let this mind i was in christ be in you who thought it not robbery to be equal with god you might as well say praise the lord i'm finding who i am it's my position in christ and when she realizes who she is worthy good not of your goodness and none of your worthiness it's all him he says you're good he says you're worthy oh i'm just not worthy i'm so humble no you're not you're an unbeliever brother that is a denominational thought but at the sounding of the seven angels message that word endures forever what goes in the ground is coming out of the ground that corn of wheat went in the ground you are the harvest of what went in the ground glory amen so what he is she is well we're going to beat that devil down today get him beat him right down brother erickson because he's not even worried to talk about we might as well just boot him out of the room as we said last night he's howling about this because she's getting it she is actually getting it now so now he that soweth the good seed is the son of man remember we read the quota of the christ mystery god revealed last night he couldn't reveal himself as as a god that lived for billions and trillions and eons and trillions of times but he could reveal himself as the son of man so now this he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom there you go there you go the good seed so god is telling you you're good the devil's telling you your bath so who are you going to believe i think i'll choose jesus [Music] i am the good seed and so now the good seed are the children of the kingdom of god but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy so of them is the devil harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels and i jesus sent angels to the church ages it was god that sent this message for you to realize who you are in the word and his word come on you thought it was the bible but now i'm saying to you the word endureth come on the word the word the word the word endureth forever and ever and ever amen we are the word made flesh today this is what the scripture said we don't just sing about it saying we confess it we speak it we live it we love it amen we don't play church no more they're not playing church oh praise the lord hallelujah bring 15 songs huh get the preacher preaching that's playing church don't play church if the word strikes your heart say amen if the word becomes real then you lift up your hands glorify god we have a place we can let off the pressure and that is right here right now as soon as you go out those doors i got a mortgage payment i got a car payment i got groceries to buy i got this to go and right now you're forgetting everything why because you're sitting in heavenly places brother abraham says we're sitting in heavenly places always amen so we take this with us we don't just leave it at church we're not playing church we are the church so now we know the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that saw them as the devil the harvest is the end of the world did not your prophet preach harvest time didn't he not preach harvest time did he not say the combines are coming so now what are we waiting for that last one so what our duty is then to go get the last one right that's all we do and we don't even have to do anything because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of god we've been having a revival in our little church and we're not even doing anything because it isn't the works of man it's the works of god you say brother tom how did it happen well there was a group of brothers got together and said we're going to have a prayer meeting brother tom we need a prayer meeting we want burden man call out on god we want to see a revival in our church i said well brethren i'll tell you what this is the way we're going to do it just get the five brothers or six brothers that are really burdened and then guru just 10 then 15 20. the last prayer meeting we had that 34 brothers why because god was answering our prayers we were putting our backslidden sons on a prayer list we got a whiteboard brother ray and we just sat around that circle said what's on your heart brother i'm praying for brother roy floren's son he's a backslidden boy he's in toronto he's 5 000 miles away but we want him saved god sent that holy ghost these brothers collectively prayed and he came back to church i was reading i was i'm preparing a message like i did this morning or yesterday and today and preparing a message i get up sunday morning and i said something's wrong brother wayne was you're just helping me all the way to church today something's wrong something's wrong what didn't be wrong i loved what i haven't even preached that message yet and i got up and worried something's wrong so strong and that's a hard place because you've got people that are waiting to hear the word of the lord and so i got i get i get i know what's going on i need something and all of a sudden scripture came do is your brother abel and you'll do well i go my that's not even near where i wasn't going and then scripture started to come scripture started to come quote started to come i said well i guess that's the message so i wrote it all out and here's this boy that we've been praying for all the way from toronto sitting in that surface i and here's his his sister and brother sitting in church that are filled with god they serve god together and they had a baby dedication he says i think i'll come to the baby dedication because my best friend is having a stag party if i go there i know it'll be a bad thing so i think i'll come to church this morning he en he doesn't know that the holy ghost has already brought him to church and so when i open up the bible i said let's just read out of genesis where god speaks to serpency can you imagine god speaking the serpency he did around this world thousands upon thousands it was god speaking just do as your brother abel and you'll do well she says well look at my sister look at my brother they're blessed of god baby dedication husband serving where am i he says to himself where am i he says god's speaking to me gives his heart to the lord that day we baptize him and he's serving god amen we might as well give god the glory hallelujah you say oh brother tom that was just one brother you prayed all for that one we always say just for one but just a second we have now five more baptisms from there we have four more people coming to church from him he's a witnessing machine i just baptized two of his witness guys he witnessed to and their wives and their family and they have dedicated their families i pray i baptize their husband wives are god's dealing with i say the move is on it doesn't matter whether it's cloverdale doesn't matter if it's ohio it doesn't matter where it is we are one body [Applause] it's not a man it's a body you're the winners do you guys have a football team in ohio state no is that what it's called i'm guessing buckeye oh there was a buckeye game the other night because i was on the airplane and everybody's going there's a game on tonight yeah it's a big deal man the guy had his phone out and spending i don't know how much money watching a football game i don't know who won or whatever [Laughter] you made my point very clear because he said we won i said how did you win how did you when you're on an airplane you are logged in you've never been on the field you've never touched the football but he said we won why he was identified with the team come on you're identified with this resurrection [Applause] you have won glory that's why brother brahms said i've identified when they were on guam i identified with washington at the delaware identified he said i was there but i was there in jesus christ i was there with paul meeting the pillar of fire come on i was there with william brown when that pillar of fire hung over that prophet we won [Applause] hallelujah come on it's harvest time we can rejoice the life is in the seed and if you're the good seed you have a right to rejoice you have a right to shout and sing you have a right to glorify god hallelujah we're in an exodus hour at harvest time when did the children of israel pass jordan was at harvest time everything's at harvest time when was ruth revealed at harvest time you go and take that thought throughout the scripture when when the word was coming back to israel it was at harvest time showing that when this word is being revealed it's going to be at harvest time at harvest time that's when the enemy fights are you with me as soon as i say enemy everyone yeah come on david he didn't run away from the fight no no no no no he ran to the fight he was of a different seed and so when he heard the boasts of those philistines that philistine he said you gonna allow them to defy the armies of the living god and who are you and his brother said you're a naughty boy and every one of us say that naughty is sort of a nice word saying you're bad no look it up in the hebrew you'll find out it's a nasty word they weren't calling him just some they were calling him some words that weren't allowed to be spoken in a house huh and so but he knew who he was he knew he was anointed under a prophet's message he knew he had to go to the throne i don't care if there's a thousand goliaths that old stone would have gone bong bong bong bong because it wasn't the stone it was god that was behind the stone it's not your revelation it's going behind your revelation and that's what slaying 200 000 000 supernatural demons brother braham said when a victorious son of god walks down those sidewalks those devils faint in house it's brother ray erickson we don't see in that realm but a prophet's on that realm he was trying to tell you about that realm say man i had a hard day at work no wonder you're fighting devils all day and your angel was going around are you getting it i got it hallelujah and therefore the tares are gathered and burned in fire so shall it be at the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them that do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth and then shall the righteous oh righteous you're good you're worthy then shall the righteous shine forth as the son and the kingdom of their father who have years to hear let him hear so you wonder why you're in a battle can i help you i've already told you you're going to win anyway so do you win so let's turn to judges chapter 6. judges chapter 6. just before we read it he says and so brother brahm says in a resume of the church eight book and so we've come to the last days the latest in age that's our age we know it's the last age for the jews are back in palestine no matter how they got there they are there and this is harvest time but before there can be a harvest there has to be a ripening and that is why we were told to lay in the presence of the sun as we said last night that's the only way you can add to your stature because everything you need in this journey the prophet said is already in you you can do nothing but lay in the presence of the son that's our duty and so now we're at harvest time and the bible says here in judges six and one and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hands of the midian seven years or they've been bound for seven years can we say they've gone through their ages they've come through their ages and the hand of the millions prevailed against israel because of the medianite the children of israel made them dense now they were living under privilege this is the children of the living god but they did evil in the sight of the lord and now because of their wickedness they're living under privilege living in caves and then the enemy prevailed against them the midianites the children of israel made them dens which are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds and so it was with when israel had sown so now we see the sowing has taken place and let's just say last night we did some sawing the word so the word got song and so now and when israel had sown the medianites came up one power the amalekites came up two powers and the children of the east came up three powers religious political and demonic that's what we battle that's what your prophet said we battled three powers and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth why do you think the enemy wants to destroy the increase when you come to a meeting a special meeting on wednesday night did you say a special meeting on wednesday night every meeting special every meeting is special because jesus comes wherever two or three are gathered is that true then if where jesus is it's special so whenever the word is sown there is a devil that wants to take away your increase why do you think you have such bad days on monday because you heard the word that's the word i believe honey wasn't that a great word we heard tonight all of a sudden the broker mortgage broker pay hey by the way your payment is supposed to be a little bit higher there and then all of a sudden a sickness will strike the family i want you to realize tonight that every time god gives you an increase there's an enemy there that wants to take it away every time every meeting and that's why now we fortify ourselves in the word of god that's why the prophet said read your bible and pray what every day and how hard is that to do very hard for some it's very very very hard but it's very simple just read your bible pray every day now watch now here they come to take away they've sown and these three powers now want to take away the encamp about them to destroy the increase till they'll come into gaza and left no substance for israel the devil he is he's a he's a mean guy he's bad boys i can say worse things but i won't he's just the devil but he's out to destroy your increase you said so willingly last night i got it what did you get let's take a review class what did you get you're the virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ brother braham said christ in the midst of god revealed this bride will not fall how many believe that quote how many believe that was from the lord jesus himself absolutely but there is going to be a devil right around the corner to take that away from you and you need to say the word how did jesus defeat the devil by the word of god satan get behind me but let me for the children's sake this is a little when i started to preach whenever the devil tells you you're not a christian okay they will tell you you're not christian if you've given your heart to the lord been baptized and god's filled you with the holy ghost i know what it is to have children at a young age a son's preaching today saved at seven gave his heart to the lord in his bedroom i know what that is so when the devil says you're not that means you are because he can't tell the truth just be worried when he says you are. and i'll tell you what the devil ain't going to tell you you're a christian so if he says you're not you are say hey i like that so when they get up knowing you say you call yourself a christian amen devil i told the young people that years ago i said when you're walking down the hallway and you're seeing this that and everything else and they're calling you every name under the sun just say lift up your hands and say i'm a son of the living god and you watch those cockroaches fly because they can't stand light amen so now here's the children of israel sowing at time now they're sowing and the enemies camped about them waiting for harvest it's waiting for harvest so they're living under fear and but remember they're in there after seven days now we have to understand then here very quickly look down in verse 8 says and the lord sent what a prophet but even under the prophet's message his daddy had groves i'm gonna i'm gonna preach down to here even under the prophet's message there was a grove of baal they had an altar to baal even though a prophet was on the scene and uh years ago we used to say and you got a television set a grove but now we got ipads iphones you don't even know what i'm reading hey but god does doesn't care about me it's all about you he's trying to take your increase you come to service you say i got the word i know who i am i believe that with everything in me but all of a sudden you just say oh i think i'll watch that news feed in that newsfeed oh yeah i want to look up this subject and then another thing flashes and i'm saying where are am i how'd i get here satan is taking notes on you right now he says every time you nod your head amen agree just remember there's a snare waiting for you but i know a greater god amen so god sent them a prophet and reminded them of their deliverance out of egypt god reminded them that they were delivered out of egypt out of the world and so the prophet said unto the children of israel and said thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up out of egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and i said unto you i am the lord god fear not the gods of laodicea the gods of sports the gods of entertainment come on you stay with me these are demons that are out to destroy your increase do not fear them it is i be not afraid remember jesus is always in the boat come on it doesn't matter what kind of storm you're in stay with me doesn't matter what kind of storm you're in that storm brought jesus on the scene oh i'm going to sloan brother tom praise the lord praise the lord a storm brought down a plane for a prophet to pray for a man dying a syphilis you say the storm was bad who said it was bad that was good come on that storm brought a prophet on the scene they were living in times of storms and here's a prophet on the scene telling them now fear not the gods of the amorites whose land you dwell in and then there came an angel of the lord and brother brown said after the prophet's message the angel descended i love it so now we hear the word of the lord brother erickson we hear the word of the lord through a prophet and that prophet was making way for the lord himself and the lord himself was the one that was telling gideon you're a mighty man of valor he didn't even know that under a prophet's message but when the book was open and you found your name in the book you started to realize who you are in christ you are his victory hallelujah why because now the lord himself has come down to tell you who you are who you are and the angel appeared unto him and said the lord is with thee the mind thou mighty man of valor who believes that i i mean really i mean gideon wasn't much to look at like me or you you really ain't really we're not much to look at and yet god comes by our way he says you're the bride you're the virtuous bride you're the sinless ride you're the virtuous you're the mighty me a man of valor me i haven't done anything and neither i get in but brother brown said he did one thing he believed and that's where it separates the men from the boys he believed what the angel said he was lord if if that's really you can i give you an offering can i lay myself on the rock of revelation could you lap me up could you extend your rod could you take me as i am lord but i'm not nothing i'm i'm the least of the kingdom i'm come from a family and everybody has the same problem moses had the problem gideon had the problem we have the problem yeah but we're nobody's exactly right we are nobodies but we're somebodies we're his somebodies so now gideon is catching this revelation and so now here hear their camp's about there's 132 thousand now i know by the sounds of it people know football around here so louisiana state university anybody ever heard of them i won't hear now no never because you're not from louisiana but i'm saying that to make a point brother ray it's the largest stadium and now they're bringing me down to getting bigger but it was it held over i think 84 000 people okay because i want to give you a little visual because now here here comes israel and here they are 32 000 strong against a hundred and 120 000 strong and he says to them now if anybody's afraid just leave will you leave can you imagine they admitted they were afraid and i've said to the church well if you're afraid of this just leave they said brother tom told us to leave we're supposed to say come to church come to church if you're afraid go oh brother rail never had me back now i know that he's telling my people to go home go home if you're afraid thanks we're not afraid and then he had to keep on dividing them then he had to say okay okay now there's still too many here there's just still too many let's have another test let's see how you drink ah there's a fountain open amen there's a word opened up let's see how you drink and there was 300 that knew how to drink from the fountain and it was those 300 that gideon used so now put 300 in the middle of lsu stadium when there's 84 000 but you got to add another 50 on top of that and it was going to be those 300 that's going to defeat every one of those and my bible says not one of them died come on not one of the 300 died and and gideon put the devil on the run is that true and the bible says he was faint yet pursued amen you might get weary but keep pursuing keep pursuing [Applause] amen keep pursuing that devil he knew he had a right to drive that devil out of every part of his land it's harvest time that's when the enemy tries to take your harvest that's true brother brahma said the lutheran age was the springtime the wesleyan age was the summer of growth but the latest seen age is the harvest time of gathering it will gather the tares and it will gather the wheat but i say to you shalom bride because for this seed to ripen there had to be a light arise shine your light has come amen for the glory of the lord has risen on you you know what that glory means god's opinion of you god's opinion of you is exactly what he said in invisible union you're the sinless spot virtuous bride of jesus christ you that have been filled with the holy ghost have been given the abstract title rising of the sun it gives you permission now it gives you permission when you have the abstract everything belongs to you come on everything healing's mine come on amen deliverance is mine joy is mine gentleness is mine meekness is mine everything that god is is you i don't care he says wherever that lineage came from he's talking about now your lineage you say well i i'm this way because of my father everybody got quiet there did you blame your dad for everything what i am is because of my mother's background brother bram said now when you've got the abstract it doesn't matter what mother's done it doesn't matter what father's done come on we're at harvest time we're getting away our babiness damn i got this problem when there's no more lamb it's no more cry speak it and it's yours drive the devil out we expect to fight we expect to fight when you start hey when you start having people get saved i kept on saying to the brothers you stay with them you stay with them because the minute they start to walk in christ the devil is there to kill that seed amen he's there to take that word out of your heart from last night and this morning and wednesday night and next sunday he is there it doesn't matter what your mother done it doesn't matter what your father done it doesn't matter what your grandmother done that's the i'm quoting here because people blame everybody just blame the devil but once you get the holy ghost it breaks that lineage and you get the blood of jesus christ you get the life of your heavenly father you mean i i don't have a right anymore to be mean and nasty daddy was mean so i mean really my daddy ate me my head my daddy's a loving heavenly father so the lineage gets broken doesn't matter what mother's done doesn't matter what father's done doesn't matter what my grandmother's done it doesn't matter when this when the abstract comes it omits everything and i'm an abstract holder i want you to say i'm an abstract holder at harvest time when satan is encamped about you to take away the word of god that god has given to you in this hour you tell that devil and look i'm square in the eye i am the grain of god i am the seed of god can i continue with this with the service here can i continue all my sins are gone so once you catch that revelation saint you'd actually probably get out of your seat mm-hmm yeah not a football getting thrown down for a hail mary did you see that he jumped i grabbed that ball you should be saying did you hear what that preacher said a prophet said you have no more sin [Applause] you're free you're guiltless forgiven forever hallelujah there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but walk after the spirits i am a free son of god he called me virtuous he called me good he called me righteous he called me worthy and don't you ever let the devil tell you anything different hallelujah all sins are struck off all your sins are struck out by the blood of jesus christ the holy ghost has come the abstract title deed and god gives me by grace my the foreknowledge oh my what are you scared about laying there and everybody oh the devil hey i'm at this school reunion i hate school reunions in fact i go kicking and screaming my wife says you've got to go so what am i going to go for because i they you need to show them you're still what you are isis okay she puts me under bondage only her wives can do that i hope she's not listening she was last night so i go to this reunion and me i'm like when i go my wife says i shouldn't blame joanne for everything but [Laughter] didn't i just preach against that hey when i go to a mall oh man i'm out of the victory maul and she knows it because i just stand there i i think there's a few of us brothers say she said i said i'll just go sit in the car okay anyway i do not know how i got there but i got to this reunion and i got honey i really really i go she says yeah you need to be there she says everybody needs to know that the word is still living i say no don't preach to me so we get at this table and we're sitting there and this fellow's next to me goes hi i go hi you know everybody looks for their opportunity to witness me so he looks at me and of course they look at our wives and our wives are a reflection of who we are right so he goes oh are you a christian yeah i am so am i good i got to be honest i'm being honest very honest and so he goes um he said i was just at a a convention i said okay you had a convention say this interesting he says yeah i just got told the devil is bigger than us and that's what i said i go you got to be kidding me the lord knows how to pull it out of you he said that we got taught that the devil's so big you just ignore him and hope it doesn't hurt i go buddy let me tell you something let me tell you something malachi 14. god sent a message and he called me a mighty man of valor and i'm not going to let the devil run me reagan i'm going to put my foot on that neck and i'm gonna drive that devil out of your high life hallelujah do not listen to the devil's lie our god is greater than any problem any situation that you're gonna find yourself in that's my jesus can we talk about my jesus my father your father i got [Applause] it harvest time my when the angel descends and says you're a mighty man of eller you better start believing you're a mighty man of eller when you got the devil on the run you keep him on the run don't you you know boo and let him run a little bit you just get down and say [Music] you know the devil's a liar you know that of course you send out your mighty man and we'll send out our mighty man and whoever wins we'll just you know bow down and we'll surrender that right right goliath right david puts and nail right between his head put that stone philistines didn't run to israel they lied well you get that the devil's a liar you cannot give him land for peace come on you can't give him land for peace i'll give you peace if you just give me a little bit of this he's a liar you give him a little bit he wants a little more get a little bit more he takes more you drive him out we are not we've been taught this is your type this is your shadow we're not going to live under privilege no more we're not going to live in dens and caves and fear and doubts we're realizing who we are in christ jesus praise our god this is a neurotic age isn't it it's a neurotic age but it's not our neurotic age come on everybody's at such an erotic age what does that give you an excuse to be a neurotic i'll let that one settle down a bit no if it's neurotic everything they are we aren't you know you see these rooster haircuts that's why i call them anyway do you ever see no do you have those up in ohio and they got rooster and all of a sudden i'll see a young boy come in in the church okay where'd that rooster come from by the time you're finished preaching he's gonna have a crew cut we are not of the world we are in the world but we are not of the world we don't dress like the world we don't act like the world we don't think like the world [Applause] amen we are solid golden grain hallelujah the churches is in an erotic stage every church is proselyting pulling and fussing and stewing it's the churches not the bride brother brown is very clear on this the churches he says i no longer call you church i call you bride so the churches are proselyting the churches are pulling the churches are fussing the churches are stewing it's an erotic age but stand still that's the message stand still that's the message masterpiece so the stalk the tassel and the husk never become seed so we see that it through wesley right justification sanctification so he's he's going through it very clearly in the masterpiece he said the stalk the tassel and the shock never become seed no but are all the time becoming more like the seed now at harvest time the seed is back to the original life silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give you thee in the name of jesus christ stand up that's what we're returning back to at harvest time you know saints of god let me just help brother erickson please forgive me you make me feel so like at home when the word strikes you like in a football game 80 000 people don't stand up at the same time one might see a play that the other guy never saw and he goes wow that's an outstanding play well i look at it and say they've done that a hundred thousand times why are you so excited about it right come on pass the ball in a huddle pile on five yards really doesn't that sound huh you know and these guys are getting paid millions of bucks where'd we go wrong huh but silver and gold have we none brother brown said we're just people poor people huh and here we are believing the word of god and nobody does not know how hmm can't even get up out of me oh i've heard it a thousand times if you saw a football a thousand times they still stand they still show in hockey they shoot the same puck in the same net and the whole place goes they even paint themselves up craziness at least we don't do that but i know when you're preaching and something strikes your heart you respond brother brown said there she she got it she got it she nudged that sister dear said because you nudged it what's in your heart god has given it to you if god sees a nudge he'll say a hand he'll see an amen amen this is what we live for saints [Applause] i don't know a couple years ago on mother's day i was preaching away it's mother's day i said mothers this is the token hour this is time to claim your sons i said if you gotta if you are praying for your son your daughter stand to your feet and this sister in the back she stood up to her feet and i said she doesn't even have a baby god gave her a baby hallelujah amen no prayer line no nothing just the word of god see thou stand for that which i don't even have but jesus gave her seed [Applause] glory we need to be a little bit more liberated saint we need to reach out into the realms of god this is what i believe we don't want to bring all formalism back into the message huh no i act out too much no it's it's it's it's the original life now the original life brother brown comes back in it's malachi 4. said it would be brought this way oh my we must have all to this way we must have all the word now what did he say in revelation 10 would take place by that trip to tucson to open the church up open to the church in the days of the messenger of the seventh eighth angel and the seventh message the whole word of god will be manifested the seals that's what all the stock had left off and why all about it and what will be made manifest in time in this time at harvest time the seed is back to its original condition that's why he says in the rising of the sun she is him all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into his church that was a tremendous testimony last night tremendous god's showing us he's in his people that was a home run that was bases loaded you're down to the last inning and there's a brother and he just had that side takes that bat and hits that devil right between the eyes amen why we're at the time we're at the end time brethren the word the word has become flesh exactly like it's been promised what did brother brown said say and see it's not is not heir with a shock and he corrects it actually if you take it you think about that title it should be reversed the seed is not air the shark doesn't have air it's not air to nothing so he corrects at the next service the next time he preaches it and he says now the shock is not there with the seed that says bonus so all the life is back in the seed and the son of man went forth sowing and he sowed the seed for the seventh age and here you are come to harvest time got it you got it i'm i'm the golden grain i'm the golden grain oh my listen to what he says invisible union do we have a few more minutes well you're gracious brother erickson everybody back home and say no i did not say that the life invisible union the life is in the grain again the same church the same thing the same word and so i said to the church back home i said take invisible union and read it monday you'll have victory then on tuesday pick it up again and re-read it then you'll have victory again then on wednesday read it again and they're looking at me like because i do that i tell them christmas to god reveal i can't i said how many times you read that hundreds and every time i read it it's like i've never read it i said why did i underline that pink purple green yellow i don't have any more colors to underline because as the word unfolds everything else unfolds with it and now what is uh now remember okay and i'm not pointing to tom e tommy where is the final voice where does brother brown say the final voice is he said the final under her messenger she is the final voice to the final age so then is it brother erickson preaching or is it god through brother erickson is it brother wayne preaching or is it go through the brother wing but we're we're still caught up in the veil get past the veil get past the veil the life is in the grain again i got the do you sing this song here ben i've got the life of god in me no i'll help you i don't even sing i got the life of god in me i got his life his nature and his ability i got the life of god in me bethany i know she's impressed isn't that true though if she's him the grain is back to the same word you can say the the grain that went in the ground christ went in the ground coming up through the church ages coming to full seat again that we can say the life of god's in me yeah i got the life of god in me glory i got his life his nature and his ability i've got the life of god in me sounds lovely not my voice i mean the words the life is in the grain again same church same thing same word the same word has sucked up through these and come out here come to a head here and the life that's come through here has picked up its people have you got that the word has come through here and has picked up its people picked up its people now it's forming into the head for what the rapture it's the same jesus get here we go how how many how many actually believe invisible union i know you do i know that's a crazy question but it's good for you to confess it so then what he says then it says it's the same jesus in bride form okay we got that but it doesn't stop there are you listening all mothers say amen all single sisters say amen and then we preach to the brothers and the sisters are left out i don't want to leave you out so now the same jesus in bright form with the same power can i give you another example here's the sister's got leukemia in the church i just heard that she's got a some problem i get a phone call and we need to pray for the sister and all of a sudden in the middle of the service i call out her name said now that thing on you is finished she stood to her feet and that leukemia spirit left her no different than our dear sister whose ankle gets broken that god puts in its position it's the same god same jesus bride formed with the same power is that we have to believe this is where it falls down to do you believe we believe amen then he goes on to say and get ready to close the bride knows where she stands the bride knows where she stands when you're in a business and you're running a business and you're where the buck stops i'm not talking about presidents because i know your mind goes there and everybody says the buck stops here but it doesn't really but in a real company when it comes down to it the buck stops at the owner the employee could have blown it lost you tons of money but because he's representing your company you take ownership to fault that's the way it used to be when i owned the company and sometimes well of course the brother's not working there now but it happens happens right but when you know you're in the right you can stand there because truth is truth right is right wrong is wrong and god always backs truth always truth and so now the truth is marching on stay with me truth is marching on and if you stay in truth r-c-e-o amen our five-star general he's gonna back up truce whether we blow it or not jesus is going to come on the scene that's why we call him a kind heavenly father the reason the light is shining gross dark rises high and the lights come right gross darkness the land grows darkness the people the bible says what that gross darkness you say well i can see pretty well out here i get up in the morning i don't see gross darkness well the gross darkness isn't the element of what we see it's in the element of the people so the gross darkness if you take a look at it you'll find out this darkness is attitude change and that is why satan's kingdom is suffering such a an abysmal attack in his kingdom to his people because brother brown said satan feeds on the flesh of his children so you'll have different things rise up and they got this saying and this new slang and this woke and this whatever we don't get it all into that stuff it's gross darkness the people because it's the attitude of the people that changes when i was in university in 1972 if you said homo you're a you're homosexual it was not said in a question it was a really or you said it a little bit stronger than that but i don't want whomever might be listening to do whatever they do anyways it called it out that's wrong sodom's wrong and then it starts to change our attitude like i'm just gave you the example brother branham wasn't afraid of it i'm not afraid of it it's sodom it is absolute sod but the attitude of gross darkness changes people's attitude and they change their pronouns change pronoun and you say well how are you doing sir well you call me sir i'm a she i say you got an adam's apple does that not sound crazy and they're trying to make us think like them never we're the word we're the word as it was in the days of sodom socially being the days of the revealing of the son of man we have elohim and he stands behind troops see it you him what what i've been brought up in a wrong age but i know he's a he and she's a she and then it's in it i i don't know if i said last night or whatever but i was approached by somebody the other day and i looked at it and i go okay i'm afraid to say what you are have you ever come across that not here of course ohio is not as weird as vancouver let me tell you what are you so i had to get that's why he said i had to go down the list well the hair is cut like a woman dressed like a woman but adam's apple adam's apple gives them away every time it's craziness it's crazy we even have to think this way and we're the weirdos are you kidding me we're the weirdos you aren't the weirdos you are the virtuous amen we've come to the time when they call good bad and bad good it's time for a rapture i hear the combines coming hey man come on ruth come on ruth boaz is on the scene come on come on and the bible says that isaac dwelt at the well of abraham and when he drowned at the well of abraham his harvest was a hundred fool hallelujah i've been at the well of william branham and guess what my harvest is a hundredfold why because it was god that gave us as well hallelujah they've got to change attitude they're changing men to women brother brahm said and women to men the fog is on the people femininism is gone masculinity is gone why he said because it's a changing of attitude don't let laodicea change your attitude i want you to say at the closing of this service i got it brother tom simple three words i got it i know who i am i know what time i'm living in and i'm gonna be gone in the twinkling of an eye i'm gonna be gone no more time to say goodbye i'm gonna be gone you don't sing that ah praise the lord that i'll thank that too that's what we're living in that's the time we're in at harvest time amen why it's in you saints you didn't put it there god put it in you can i say this in closing once something's put in you it's in you you can't put on this message that message is in you the message is in you brother brown says it like i'll just can i give you a little ending here okay brother brown said you know people are born singers so if you're born a singer you're a singer if you're not i'm proof of it you hear not if you're of the devil's seed you're of the devil's seed and if you're god's seed you're gonna see you either got it or you don't i got it i don't get it at the end of the service i got it so he says now people that are born to be singers they're singers some time ago i was buying my little girl a little piano for christmas seems like she was inclined to play music so i was standing there and my wife she can't play either and i was trying to pick out a cord on this little thing and a little boy came up to me about eight years old little shoes were off his feet and his hairs needed a trimming very bad it was down to his shoulder sort of a raggedy coat on stood there and looked at me a little bit and said what are you trying to do mister what are you trying to do only brother brown way to do it you know here he is on a piano you know trying to find a piano for his daughter for and this little raggedy boy long hair there just coat you know shoes off and what are you trying to do mister what are you trying to do he said i'm trying to make this chord you know there's a g chord i can do g chord that's the simplest chord i know how to do a g chord but brother bram didn't apparently he said i'm trying to make this chord he said he said let me have it well i thought what poor little ignorant child like that know anything about a panel is your prophet oh my he was a master with it an eight-year-old boy it's either in you or it's not you either got it or you don't you're either seed or you're not so he got on there and he started to play he walked over them to this xylophone picked it up and played silent night i never heard anything like it then he took about a six or eight inch piece of a gas pipe really a gas pipe took a six inch or eight inch piece of a gas pipe laying there in the hardware store he blowed the star spangled banner through the pipe all right here's a prophet trying to play a piano what are you trying to do mister he said i'm trying to get a card step aside you ragged ignorant kid what do you tell a prophet what to do huh and he starts playing he says music like i never heard before goes over to the xylophone and starts playing the xylophone then all of a sudden he gets his pipe sits in along star spangled banner can you imagine there's a prophet awestruck over in because it was in him come on come on people it is in you you are the mighty bride of valor gideon didn't know he had it in him i didn't know i had it in me you didn't know he had it in me you but then the angel came down said it's in you and now you're playing a different kind of music called the heavenly music you're playing the word hallelujah he said son have you ever had a music lesson he said what's that you ever been to church before you just ask me that if you want what's that i don't know what church was i saw them i walked in them walked out of them but there was something else that was laying deep within it wasn't a six inch pipe or an eight inch pipe it was the word of god that was laying there for you and me to play he was born a musician it was just a gift to know how to do it you were born to be a believer you were born to be the elected lady of the bride of jesus christ you were born for the rapture and may god bless you and encourage you in the faith to walk onward christian soldier and let truth keep marching on in your life and don't ever let the devil get you down can you say i got it brother ray i want you to take a look at your congregation and say they got it they're never gonna they're never gonna call you again with any problems glory he set me up for this this is what the word's all about we're to enjoy it we're to enjoy this what do you mean i don't have any problem you know i got problems yeah but my god is bigger than any problem you and i will ever have my my mind you're not wayside you're not stony side you're not torn aside you're predestinated good ground brother brown said just seeds just seeds justified seeds seeds had to have predestinated good ground so the seed in you being predestinated was predestinated also to have prepared good ground for the seed to grow in and that's why now we've been in the arising we've now been in the presence of the sun you're now golden brown and now since 1965 to 2021 the grain is ripened and i hear now the combine's coming i see ruth manifesting i see now how the children of israel at harvest time walked into their inheritance and i jesus sent angels to your church so that you could come to this revelation i jesus sent you put your name there i jesus sent you malachi 4 sent you the presence of almighty god to come and ripen your seed at harvest time to god be the glory amen let's power his musicians why don't you come please nothing brother brown said can stop it nothing can stop it there's nothing that's going to stop you from coming to your position and maturity in christ say within your heart of hearts this morning lord jesus i've heard your word i believe your word i'll stand on that word and i confess i've taken it in the good ground of my heart and i'm going to stand in my position victorious over every situation and i'm going to walk in the victory given to me through the word of god precious lord jesus a wonderful time in your presence this morning a wonderful group of people have gathered to hear thus sayeth the word not the words of a man but a word that has already been vindicated by the angel of god himself and so father i just pray that something would have been sown something in the

your heart not by your feelings but you know in your heart that god has done something through the word for you why don't you give testimony and just stand to your feet if he hasn't you can sit where you are but if god has done something very special through the word to you you can thank him tonight this morning from the depths of your heart it's not something put on it's something that you want to give him the praise for and you can lift up your hands and cry oh lord jesus i thank you for your word i thank you for dealing with my heart i thank you for your presence at moving from individual to individual if you do have a need and you've stood in his presence and you want to leave the house of god leaving the chains behind or the bondage behind and you say i am the victorious elected cg
