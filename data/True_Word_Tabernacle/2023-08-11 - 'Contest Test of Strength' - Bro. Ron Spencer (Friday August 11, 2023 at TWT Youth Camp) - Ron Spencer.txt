finished he said now it's picture time he said let's get a picture so we'll do that in a moment [Music] isn't this beautiful [Music] Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse 4. hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord without shall love the Lord with all thy soul with all thine might these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children so talk of them when thou set us down and when thou walkest by the way and when thy last down and when thou arises up Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand they shall be frontlets between thine eyes thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates and it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swear unto their fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou build us [Music] this great day God bless you with your child he saw this baby before the foundation in the world and as he placed you here Satan did everything he could to stop you you joined hands and I stood with you at your wedding with Brother Ray even ordained you to be a minister and now God has blessed you with the life of a beautiful boy you've named him powerful names maybe I'll be a god-grandfather self-appointed yes now you see what you have before you is the living physical attribute of God that he thought of before the foundation of the world he thought of him before you thought of him maybe you thought I'd like to have a special child and God thought I'll give them a boy because life is a miracle God placed him in your home you'll have the responsibility to watch over him to care [Music] from this point we've asked God to be with you tonight I want to ask the angels of the Lord if you'll remember you'll remember what it's like for Moses's mother and he said Place him in a bull rush and I'll have angels to watch over you so we're asking the Lord to dispatch those angels to watch over you now we're going to give you this [Music] thank you [Music] that's right that's right [Music] like for you to lay your hand on the baby he was named after you and I Heavenly Father what a loving caring God that you are you're so great you can speak worlds into existence but you're so tender handed you can lay your kind hand upon a baby and Lord in your busyness of your schedule you took time when you were here to bless little children then to remind us all except you become as a little child you're not enter to the kingdom of heaven now father we thank you for this baby doll now Lord Jesus as I've taken him into my hands Spencer Warren we ask you that you would watch over him despite special angels father to protect him when he gets sick we know your healing when Danger's near we ask you to protect him father may you bless this home I pray that even as his little gift begins to manifest I pray that you'd watch over him bless this home today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amenity [Music] he may be a preacher [Music] and Paul you want to hold him and get a picture [Music] God bless you I so love you I love you with all my heart I am so proud thank you for having me

thank you for your patience amen how many has come under expectation amen I I would just like to say thank you for having me and I just want to ask you to do something for me I want you to invite the Lord to where you're setting just now you're not too far back for him to reach you you're not too far left or right for him to touch you I believe he's here to feel it every electron of this building with his presence now blind Bartimaeus he began to scream thou son of David have mercy upon me and he invited Jesus into his world and he heard him now as we stand I'd like for you to invite him now to where you're sitting and you have needs you've came a long way you've came a long way tomorrow night will be the prayer line but you have needs if you're like me I don't want him to pass by and I not get a touch from him now what you just now as we begin to pray I would like for you personally to invite him where you're at let's invite him Heavenly Father Lord we love you with all of our hearts now Lord Jesus we dedicate this service to you we need you to come by Lord we can all gather and we've got with Great Expectations now father we ask you that you would come we are a needy people not only is the speaker needy but every one of us here have great needs sometimes needs are so personal we can't even utter it but God you're an all-knowing God and you're a God that hears and answers prayer now father I ask you that you would come in a special way tonight speak to our hearts father Lord bless every person in this building dear God lord and we give you all the glory and all the honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen and amen God bless you God bless you isn't he wonderful to you amen I'd like to personally thank you for your prayers and continued prayers for us as we battle cancer for those that don't know we battle cancer in our lungs and in our brain because of melanoma and we take chemo every day and and just to make sure that Satan showed up after this service last night was the worst night that I've had in three and a half years but you know that just goes to show we're getting ready to have a good night thank you foreign that I'm taking some things personal I am it's kind of like poking a bear if you poke a Believer long enough you'll get a fight amen amen the Lord laid on my heart tonight to speak on the contest a test between strengths amen I find it interesting that our messenger of the day brother Branham was a boxer he's not only fought Satan but he was a boxer and he knew how to fight so as his understudies we're also boxers not just men but there's some ladies in the room at Satan's absolutely terrified of so let's just dedicate this service to whipping the devil would that be all right amen Psalms chapter 23 if you'd like to turn there with me you know it by heart since you was a child the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures then he leadeth me beside of the Still Waters he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil I like that I will fear no evil in the Valley of the shadow of death for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou Upon Us my head with all in my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and now comes the Covenant and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you may be seated brother Branham said that Satan took Jesus up on the mountain and set him down and he rebuked him again with the word defeated Satan with the word of God now he brings you into the equation showing that the weakest of Christian and you may feel like well brother Ron I feel like the weakest in this building well you're still involved the weakest of Christian can defeat Satan with thus saith the Lord it is written it is written it is written he could have took his power he could have he could have took a lot of of his gift but he took the word that you would have to use knowing that as a Believer you would follow his pattern and his example it is written it is written it is written it's not written by prophets it's written by God it's our covenant it is the infinite word of God amen Revelations chapter 12 and verse 7 and there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and Prevail not neither was there found any place found any more in heaven and the dragon was cast out of that old serpent called the devil Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out to him and I heard a great loud voice saying in heaven I like this I heard a great loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ Hallelujah I want you to read this with me now for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death I want you to read this and make it personal now these first phrases and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony I want you to realize there's these are some things that you already know you've heard it don't never let it become a lyric or just a fable to you but you are the final voice [Applause] you are the final voice to the final age nobody can take your place when God was laying out who would be and when they would be and what time that they would be born in what age if they would be born God chose you to be the final voice to the final Edge people from all the ages if they would have been given a choice they would have took your place but God reserves your position thank you he reserved your position he has gathered you you are not an accident he has gathered you and he has called you an invincible Army on the Earth because you will discern and withstand now I want to just ask you now who gathered us here who has gathered us here who has watched over our Gene seeds since the foundation of the Earth when marriages would happen and this one would marry this one when Wars would take place when plagues would happen God watched over your natural seed one in a million throughout every generation he had a photo of you before the foundation of the world you're wonderfully and fearfully made thank you he has gathered us he has placed us he has elected us he didn't just do it to see if he could do it he's got you here for a purpose more than just said in a meeting more than just set on a Pew but God has raised you up to destroy the works of the devil I'd like to say this to you Satan is in trouble [Applause] Satan is in trouble knowing that you have arrived and he hasn't been able to stop you for thousands of years of your arrival [Applause] if he couldn't stop you for those thousands of years how can he stop you now I believe the redeemed ought to say so I believe we ought to speak it I believe we ought to say Amen to it I would like to remind Satan he cannot stop this end time Revival this moment has been designed and preserved for you God has orchestrated even where you set what you're wearing he has prepared this moment he has watched over our Prophet stood there and knew that the seeds were coming as he preached sermons and felt the rejection of the message of the hour no wonder God had to take him beyond the curtain of time and millions would scream we're rushing on it [Applause] are you with me maybe even as he preached here there would just be a handful of people that would catch the message but God knew you were coming he knew you would be born in total darkness to where and even a prophet of God couldn't see past but God designed you and God built you to live in this age so we would call this that you are the final runners and God designs his best to run at the end that's not a stone's throw at anybody else that's lived down to an edge they overcame in their age but now's our turn so I'd like to say this let's finish it let me just say no matter what Satan Whispers in your ear we will not be shaken we will not turn around we will not be defeated [Applause] we are a chosen generation you're a generation with purpose the message is more than books and tapes but it's living reality living on the inside of you what God has started he will finish it okay I want you to think about that your pastor brother Wayne spoke it this weekend maybe for the visitors nothing but you're the spoken seed word of God as I heard him speak that to you you're the spoken word see God spoke you into existence he spoke a message that you would catch a host of more than a script for an actor but it became real life you come from many different diverse places God didn't put us all in the same church no wonder Satan has such a hard time you don't need a thousand people to crack you up you may be one in a million one in your family you may be the only youth in your church let me just say this to you God trusts you he's not looking for your seed that he trusts he trusts the Jean seed of God that he put inside of you before the foundation of the world so with that in mind we recognize that the weakest of Christians shake the kingdom of hell when you go on your knees and begin to pray [Applause] now let me just say nobody can take your place and neither can you take somebody else's place God's got a job for you to do if you can sing sink if you're called to preach preach if you're called to clap your hands clap your hands but none of us have been called to be a bunch of sissified panty waste Church mice we have come to the house of the Lord to worship God and to let him know we're here and to tell Satan what side that we are on foreign 27 said the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fill though War should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy so no matter how bad you have to fight the devil all week long when you show up at church [Applause] you have a license to Worship the Lord hear O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou set us seek ye my face and my heart shall said unto thee thy face will Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger for thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and mother forsake me then the Lord will will take me up teach me thy way O Lord and Lead Me in the playing path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies I like this for false Witnesses are risen up against me and we can say amen and such a breathe out cruelty notice these words I had fainted unless I believe to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living I'm not trusting in my own energies or My Own Strength wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord a contest a contest is a strength it's a test of strength a test of strength Indian tradition says that they would the strongest would pull on two different sides of maybe a rope or a pull or a a pole and they would pull the other one Into the Fire so what I'm going to do here tonight is I'm going to challenge you two different ways if you were backslidden or you don't know God I want to pull you into the Holy Ghost Fire and if the devil has showed up for the meeting I want to pull him into the fire we must be determined don't never be defeated you can't be defeated this is a direct quote you're the children of God promised the Holy Spirit to every believer so if you're here tonight and you say well I don't know if I've got the Holy Ghost this is your night you're fighting against the darkness and even your self-will but God is determined and it's promised you that you can have the very life of God living on the inside of it because you can't overcome on your own you can't overcome in your own in your own theology or your own intellect or your own self-will but with him living on the inside of you you can't lose [Applause] brother Brown said no your enemy trained for the contest and you're going to have to you're going to have to meet him he says and know him know what his strength is and when you train for this contest you know you're going to meet him for it's one thing's for sure you're going to meet him so you've got to train for the contest not training for a contest is like a boxer his enemy that he's going to meet out there in in the contest he will fight a really good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent he studies his lips knows where he's fighting for whether he leans forward or hangs back fights right-handed or left-handed he studies him he studies all of this and then if he's a good smart fighter he gets him a sparring partner that'll fight just like his opponent will fight for he knows all of his lips and when he gets to that place now he says I think it's a very good thing for a Christian to do if you want to start training you start with John 3 16 the Golden Rule he says start out right that you'll get on the right floor and then you train you you train for The Knockout punches because you're going to have to use them everybody knows that you have to train to to hit your enemy and always God uses his word and just remember that God uses his word to fit the internet if God could think or could have give his people anything better to defeat the enemy with he would have done it so as I have always said when God makes a decision that's the best that there is he never has to alter his decisions so it's the first decision that God gave these people in the Garden of Eden to combat the enemy was his word they were fortified with the word now the enemy is going to study the strategy with the word and now Satan studied all of that out so so perfectly when he come to Eve he had the best strategy that he could use upon her and that's to reason with the word now you never want to reason with the word just believe it [Applause] don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out you can't figure out God so God is the word and he made it for you just to believe that's our strength just accept the word brother Ron that sounds so simple well I'm gonna get to you brother Brandon being a boxer he talked about a man that would train him six seconds Smith he said when I first started training for boxing before I got to into the professional fighting there used to be a trainer and they called him six seconds Smith the reason they called him that because he knocked out his opponents in six seconds so there was somebody before Mike Tyson and he would hit him so hard Telly would knock through the ropes all four ropes he would knock him and knock him so hard until brother Branham would fly over into the chairs and he's told him he said six he said you just knocked the breath out of me he said I just about broke my back and six second told him said it'll do you good do me good how can it do me good you're about to kill me he said look Billy I don't care how physically fit you are your bodies got to be able to stand and come back quick you got to be able to take the punch if you're if your body's not used to coming back you'll lay there and and take the count but if your body's used to taking it then you'll come back every time you get hit that shocks the blood and it runs it right back to the heart said if you do that then your body's used to coming by quick and when you get knocked down you'll get back on your feet of death he said you may Hate Me Now but you'll appreciate me when you get out there in the ring now brother Brandon we don't leave that in the boxing ring he said but I found something you don't have to Baby around with believers just pour it on you'll appreciate me when you're when you come to Calvary when they come to the end of your road you'll praise God I'm glad that I took that old rugged way here I stand with the blood wash of the Lamb you don't have to Baby around them old creeks and things out there come on get in the way God has a way he's got a plan it was wrote right there in the Bible oh don't you love it now brother Brandon was praying and he's praying against the enemy and he says Satan you can't hold them no more they're God's children right now and I'm bringing them before you you have to take your hand off of their lives they belong to God now and I claim them for him I claimed them as trophies of Christ's love at Calvary I challenge you to a debate you don't have any legal power you have no power over them you didn't have it in the first place you were just bluffing them you're only bluffing them and Christ stripped you of everything that you had at Calvary he stripped you of every Power that you had and you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your blood I want to remind you our God is not dead but he is very much alive and he's in this building right now he's not a Million Miles Away so the house of hell that would like to hold you Bound in prison walls even now I want you to know there's a power in the building right now that's not the keys to the door and if Jesus assigned your pardon accept it and walk up and tell the devil I will not be your slave no longer Satan I want to remind you our champion stood there and said I have power to lay my life down and power to take it up again there was nothing you could do to stop it our promises we are going for a Rapture and we're going to have a body change that's coming a resurrection there's coming a rapture we will see the physical Lord Jesus Christ and there's nothing that you can do to stop it nothing thank you nothing Our God has never lost a case he's never been in a crisis he has never lied he's never went back on his word he is always on time he always has the right decision God has given unto us unlimited power so why don't we use it [Applause] brother Ron I've been I've been I've been through some battles well this might describe you I have been sick before but I made it I have been broke before but I manage I've been broken-hearted before but I made it I have been betrayed but I made it I have been lied on but I made it I have been destitute but I made it I have been rejected but I made it [Applause] say it with me I am here and I made it [Music] I love this quote brother Graham said don't underestimate Jesus Christ because he's the power over all powers don't be afraid of Satan as long as you're in him but if you're not in him you better tremble but if you're in him Jesus Christ not even death itself can harm you you're free from all fear when I think about that I wanna shout amen Hallelujah now you see this age tells us that we're going to be Overcomers so Overcomers means that we're going to have to wrestle with some things we're going out to fight for every promise that God has given to us it is our Promised Land we're going to have to fight we're going to have to fight for every inch of ground but Victory is in our camp [Applause] for a new birth you've got to fight for it now some people say well brother on you you know there's just way too much emotion well the devil would say that and a good old Church of Christ would say that but it's hard for me to believe that message Believers would say that you don't like that you're you're going to be miserable for about the next 45 minutes one of a hundred some quotes I can prove that anything without emotion is dead so if your religion hasn't got any emotion about it bury it okay somewhere and get a new one that's got some life in it so if your church I'm used to being in trouble I might as well get here now if your church is dead I won that's a lie well brother Branham I didn't get nothing out of service because that brother that brother and he's in another place called it a sister got to amen and it got you shouting and it just chills run over me brother Brown said you better not go to heaven you'll freeze to death so young people you've got to fight your way past the barrier of dead religion well brother Ron that's a workup was it a work up at volleyball wasn't a workup at the professional baseball game wasn't a work up at the hockey or the football pay hundreds of dollars for tickets and you go and set in the cold don't tell me I'm I'm in the Ohio State country I know where I'm at LSU all right I got you those people don't go there and sit still [Applause] and they go there with very much the possibility of getting beat they leave their houses they put flags on their car they're proud to be identified with their team they're thrilled to be identified they wear their shirts they wear their coats they wear their hats they don't care who's sitting beside of them I don't care who's sitting beside of them they just start shouting and they start screaming they start hollering they're doing everything that they could there's no way that the players can hear them all the way up there but they give it everything that they got then the same devil will get mad at you [Applause] same devil will get mad at you when you come to church [Applause] and you start singing and you start tapping your feet you start lifting your hands and if you're not careful you'll be dancing all over the place well it runs in our family I might as well kill that devil while I'm there I might as well kill him while I'm there King David was a dancing and again 17 miles dancing he got in the flesh he got to dancing he was shouting because the word had came back home he had ever right to shout we in this Branch Revival have every right to shout you with your emotionless religion will not shut me up you're way too late if I can Worship the Lord with Stage for cancer in my brain it's your excuse me brother Ron I'm gonna need some quotes well you came to the right guy Psalms 150. praise ye the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary so God likes praise in the church [Applause] he lets praise in the church praise God in a sanctuary Praise Him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty ice praise him for his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with a sorcery and a hop praise him with the temple in the dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs praise him with loud symbols praise him with high sounding symbols amen let everything the half breath let everything at half breath praise the Lord praise ye the Lord Hallelujah if your arms are crossed you're putting your brakes on now I want to give you a license if you're dead and your heart has stopped and your lung says quit working you have an excuse because the grave cannot praise God but while you got a chance well you got a chance what brother on I'm gonna praise him on the streets or go what about now well brother Ron I thought you was preaching on boxing and contesting test of strength I am foreign you gotta fight to Worship the Lord fight through every devil in hell that's tried to stop you from coming to church and then once you get to church and take your place it's time to show the devil who you are and what side you own oh my brother Ron that's just one isolated quote okay I'll give you another Psalms 100 Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all your lands [Applause] are you Lance so it's not just a cultural thing we're all family we're citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven here we're family here we should not be ashamed to to worship our bridegroom to worship our Lord to tell him how much we're loving I got a beautiful wife somewhere in this building somewhere somebody just point I tell her every day how beautiful she is every day multiple times a day how beautiful she is I tell her how much through these lips how much I love her come on Church it's not just a church I didn't marry a mannequin I did not marry a mannequin and neither is God [Applause] he wants to hear it from your lips brother on your way off course let me just say the same list they used to cuss tell dirty jokes say bad things after a true conversion starts praising God do you realize how much that you defeat the Devil with your worship and with your praise all right [Music] brother Ron but I fight depression start praising the Lord I fight suicide Spirits start praising the Lord [Applause] just start worshiping God in your home in your car in your family in your prayer life thank you serve the Lord with gladness and come before him with his presence with singing know ye the Lord he is God and it is he that hath made us not we ourself we are his people and sheep of his pasture and into his gates with Thanksgiving in his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good and his Mercy is Everlasting and the truth endures to all generations well brother Ron we are a mature Church bless your heart bless your heart then you ought to be the leaders in Praise then you got more responsibility brother Ron but we have education and we have intellect and we give speeches and you know we want to take a motion out of the church well that's what happens with an icebox preacher Spock's preachers produce ice cubes you need a quote brother Brown said your church is 40 degrees below zero you could I stayed up and down the aisles but I'd rather have aisles that's hot another quote for you praise ye the Lord Psalms 149 praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and praise him in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that hath made him let that children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in advance praises Praises with unto him with a temple and a heart let the lord taketh for the Lord I want you to read this with me for the Lord taketh pleasure in his people yeah it ain't prison to preacher it's pleasing your God now you say brother Ron you attacked the motion right off the bat you you you're trying to stir us up well let me just say this to you maybe you don't know and maybe I can Enlighten you here a little bit but you know when a boxer is in the back they start taping his hands and they start making music back there because they got to get the blood pumping cause he's getting ready for war in our fight we're fighting for our life we're fighting for our life we've been training all our life for this fight we've been ordained and elected and anointed for this fight I'm not here to lose sorry this is more than mind over matter I'm here to fight the enemy that's trying to destroy youth like you and I say this you we will not be defeated Romans chapter 8 and verse 28 for we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are they called according to his purpose for over more over whom he for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed in the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also Justified so if he brought you out of the Lamb's Book and he's did all of this work to get you here [Music] and he called you and he gathered you then he also Justified [Applause] so if you've asked God to forgive you of your sins been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ receive the holy ghost in your life and the devil is whispering in your ears and he's jumping on your back that devil is trespassing knock him off and if he just keeps telling you what you used to do and reminds you how bad you was and what you used to say in the pornography you used to watch just remind him God Justified me and it's as though I never did it in the first place and he took the desire of that thing out of my life and if you're still wrestling with those things in your life you've came to the right place you do not have to go home and be a slave to that any longer foreign but I can't overcome let him get in the inside of you he will overcome in your life if God be for us if God before us who can be a dead stars [Applause] I'll just be honest with you I refuse to retreat I refuse to give up I've been serving the lord 40 years now preaching almost that long but let me just say this to you there's never been a day where I wanted to go back [Music] there's nothing to go back to [Applause] Satan can offer you everything in the world but he's got nothing that I want [Applause] and you've got everything that he wants refuse to give up refuse to retreat Onward Christian Soldiers marching on the scripture says you you're of God little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you [Applause] then he that is in the world [Music] Paul say it like this in second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 5 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God I can't have strength for myself but my strength comes from him [Applause] I'm asked over and over again by incredible doctors are you ready to give up and quit your chemo quit quit why would I want to quit we're whipping cancer here now for the critic in the building said now it's not a miracle if you're taking drugs you know you need to know the naturopathic route where was you at when they gave me four months to live where was you at when I had a brain tumor that big where was you at when the doctor walks in it sets down on my bed don't know if I'm going to make it through it I had trust in God because God said if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before I did not expect to be handed to death sentence but let me just say if that's what God chose for me to walk I'm willing to walk wherever God wants me to walk I felt something so I'm going to go ahead and take care of it a doctor is about six foot five walks in about the size of you brother Aaron walks in crosses his legs looks at me he's been taking care of me I'm in palliative care he takes care of me he says uh you are a miracle you are a miracle he said do you ever have people tell you that it's not a miracle because you're taking chemo I just smiled at him he said I want you to look in the lobby I want you to look in all these offices every one of them are on the same chemo you want they're they're taking the same experimental drugs that you're taking none of them look like you [Music] so I know something about boxing I know something about fighting oh this is a life or death fight here and I've got Jesus on my side and he said I am your healer he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for mine iniquities he took those stripes at Pilates judgment Hall that I could be healed so with that in mind no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper hello brother run but I'm in the trial of my life what you don't realize God's taking your trial that he allowed you to walk in and he's taken that trial to destroy the worst of the devil it might be a little brave but cancer you're not going to win here it might be a little brave but pornography you're not going to win [Applause] depression you're not gonna win being backslidden you're not gonna win I got a fire on the inside of me and passion in my heart What About You [Applause] brother Brandon made this statement he said I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God if the devil could amen he could say this yeah he's right that man's right right there he's right if he can get them people to believe he's right he said I'm so glad that a man could so completely serve god Till the devil don't know what to do with him so if the section of Hell could say Amen they would say Amen we can't do nothing with that group of people [Applause] now to take a break and just catch your attention just for a moment but be careful there's a man named Angelo Dundee he was known as the greatest Corner man in boxing he would where's David keckley Angelo Dundee would would be the corner man for Sugar Ray Leonard David Kegley gave me a boxing glove signed by Sugar Ray Leonard he was also the corner of Muhammad Ali who is considered to be one of the greatest boxers ever in history and they would ask him what did you tell Ali in the corner he he said I didn't tell him how to fight no matter if he was in a great losing he said I just would remind him of who he was you know how to fight you know how to fight you know how to fight I'm just here to remind you of Who You Are [Applause] interesting little story I'll share it with you I'll leave in one of the greatest Fighters that would ever live he'd be like some of you sitting here he got knocked down knocked out became unconscious and it was intimidating humiliated extremely distressful for him but he immediately called for a rematch [Applause] he didn't take a vacation he went right back into training he went right back into getting himself ready and he found a man that could hit as hard as his Challenger and he told that man don't you take it easy on me you hit me just as hard as that man hit me you hit me to where my heart stops you hit me to where you knocked me up cause I'm determined to stay on my feet I'm determined and he trained and he trained and he trained and he trained and he trained and he trained and he trained and he was in the back back there and there was it says getting him ready the night had come the challenge was ready they stood there with their opponent coming out screaming I am the champion and he knew who was the champion who I feel like preaching he knew who was the champion somebody else was carrying his belt [Applause] carrying his belt and he'd come out dancing and it was all business but this time when he got hit with that hard knock and his head started to spin and he felt the chaos of her coming on him again he stayed on his feet he got against the ropes he would call it the rope-a-dope he would stay on the ropes until he came back to himself and when he came back to himself he knew who he was and he knew what he was capable of doing I'm not talking about Muhammad Ali right now but you've been hit with some punches that knocked you all over the place knocked you out knocked you down you thought you'd never get back up again but God rich in Mercy reached down and grabbed a hold of you and you started the training process over and over and over again you came to church you came and worshiped you read the word of God you listened to the tapes and Here Comes Your Challenger and he hits you with his best shot and you just stand there and sleep you just shake it for a little while and when you come to yourself I am bone of this bone I'm life of this life I'm power of his power I am an overcomer I'd like to say Satan has underestimated you now he's been known for that before let me remind him three Hebrew children in a fire [Applause] a prophet in a in a dungeon full of full of lines Hallelujah an old man walking around I'm going to have a son I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna have a son an old woman sitting in their tent and God having a teller that's nothing impossible [Applause] one man took a Jawbone of an ass and killed a thousand because the word said he could do it one man because the word said one will chase a thousand and to prove it could happen one man picked up a Jawbone of an ass and killed pornographic devils [Applause] dead devils that religion devils that preacher to help us backslidden devils you just kill one at a time you don't kill 10 of the time you just kill one at a time kill one and the devil supposedly said I'm just stick around see if I can whip it and you want boom two boom three boom I may have my boobs backwards [Music] why don't you take the courage to tell your devil that you came to this campfighting that's right came to this Camp fighting you don't have to be ashamed you've been in the fact the devil's supposed to fight you but you're supposed to win you're supposed to win you're supposed to win come on come on I don't know who you are but you got a nice shirt on come on I don't know who you are I don't even know where you come from but you look good in them jeans don't look good now we ain't them kind either we're real men here but you came no doubt fighting a lot of devils you came thinking I don't know how I'm gonna make it I don't know how in the world I'm gonna hold on but I want to tell you you're not the one holding on you're not the one holding up cause you would have quit a long time ago but you left your house where at Arkansas do you have a passport you left your house in Arkansas now I don't know who you are but Satan's swore to you he'd destroy you isn't that right he's told you he's put everything he can against you to destroy you and you're right he's put all kind of Family Matters against you to destroy you but God put something on the inside of you and I want to tell you you're going to win hey that's right you're gonna win man you're gonna win you came with purpose you came to overcome you're not going home defeated what about you [Applause] young man standing beside him he swore he'd get you too you've been fighting a real fight ain't that right I've been fighting a real fight but you didn't come to this Camp to go home the same person you didn't you didn't come here to get defeated you come here for victory you're Joe's son behind him you didn't come here to be defeated just being in the daddy of a preacher's home won't give you Victory but you came here with one thing on your mind I'm going home with more Victory than ever before in my life all right Aaliyah Aaliyah last night you had a breakthrough you'd been looking for that kind of breakthrough but tonight's your night to get filled with the Holy Ghost foreign man from his birth was predestinated to kill Philistines but he got tangled in his flesh and he found himself into Lila's lap like a lot of you have but that wouldn't end God didn't write that Son of God off he didn't say I'm finished with him he said Satan you have underestimated Mike's power I want to tell the devil to not shaken you have underestimated these kids you've underestimated these Believers that are sitting here tonight he found himself had a grinding meal with his eyes put out his hair shaved Nazarite Val looks like it's gone but be careful of what you see temporary problems temporary circumstances it's not the Eternal answer God didn't choose you to lose you so if you were a prodigal away from home eating in a pig pen get too caught up with where you're at because there's coming up going home party they had him tied to a meal grinding corn in the middle of the city it was over in a place that was down and in that grinding meal people could walk up and look at the champion and they could make fun of him and they could spilled on him and had their little children to come up and make fun of him whistle at him and spit on him but he just kept grinding he just kept going going to his Pew he just kept pushing all he knew to do was push and pray push and pray push and pray push and pray go to the Altar and pray lift your hands and praise the Lord Echo and amen out it may not seem like you're going anywhere it may not seem like Victory is close in hand but your hair is growing seem unconscious but your hair is growing back up you can feel it down on your ears and after a while you can feel it on your shoulders and when you shake your head you can feel it and you know it's being restored one prayer at a time whether you know it or not every service you didn't close at you're getting closer to your body change you're getting closer to seeing your loved ones keep pushing keep pushing it what God has purposed in his heart he will bring to pass so today they thought they'd make fun of him today they had all their football gods and all their gods lined up and they were going to do some heavy worshiping and they were going to make fun of God's champion as he was walking in he was taken by the hand of a little boy and brother Branham said he prayed once more once oh brother Ron I thought I'd come to the meeting one more time I thought I'd come to church one more time Lord let me fill your presence once more maybe you've been away from God and I'm not just talking to young people now little fella this building's got to be built to worth it there's got to be pillars in it to hold it up could you take me over and put me between the pillars let me put my hands on those pillars that are holding up Satan's kingdom Satan if you're still in the building get ready and he did fill it in his flesh but there's something started moving and he began to remember what it was like to take a Jawbone and his arms go across one enemy after another he felt what it was like again to pick up the gates of the city to catch 300 foxes and sell all their tails on fire to whip devil after devil and he felt it again and he began to push today say it with me today he would take his hands push can you imagine what he felt like when he felt him start moving it's a test to shred brother Brown said you'll never know when it was like when I was looking at that little boy laying on the ground two years after the vision that was the boy there was the soldiers there was the trees he said you could line up every devil in hell [Music] [Applause] you can line up every devil in hell and you couldn't stop it If this boy is not off of the ground in five minutes then you call you call me a false prophet let me just tell you may sound boastful but you could line up every devil in hell and you can't stop this bride's Revival you say brother hun but I just can't I've come to the altar so many times and I just can't make a breakthrough I just can't make a breakthrough can I tell you about your champion I've talked to you about Muhammad Ali I've talked to you about champions of the scriptures but I want to talk to you about my champion my champion my champion stood there and didn't say a word because he knew where he was headed he had the power to call Ten Thousand Angels he had to power one of those angels could have changed the whole scene he surrendered himself to a chop block to where they would beat him until he was totally unrecognizable as a human being and he took those lips so a guy named Ron Spencer could stand here without fear of cancer I want to encourage you I don't care what the doctor tells you let me just take a moment here I don't care what the doctor tells you I don't care how bad he says it is I don't care where he says it is [Music] I don't care what the Test shows I don't care what the scan shows I don't care how long you gotta fight it we are the winner take courage fight fight fight fight fight fight your disease that you're fighting will not win everywhere Brother Ray of Satan would have known what Jesus was really doing he'd have never touched him Jesus would have died an old man that would not be nail prince in his hands thou would have not been thorns on his head he would have never carried a cross he'd have never been beat with those rods and those bra those things ripping into him until his organs would show every stripe was killing devils Satan you asked for a fact we showed up you asked for a fight here in laodicea we showed up we're here okay the scripture said I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption Jesus would say destroy this body this temple in three days I'll raise it up again Satan heard every word you was in him you was in him when he was on the cross you was in him and if Satan couldn't correct you 2 000 years ago he can't corrupt you now I don't know your battle I don't know your situation but I've talked to you about it God that does you know sometimes Satan knows it when to get you he don't fight you when there's a thousand people here he don't fight you when you're sitting in church he fights you when you get in the car he starts rattling in your ear he starts sending all kind of negative thoughts through your mind and it don't matter if you got blonde hair or gray hair your parents are oh new hair I'll get y'all he's no respected person so he fights you alone if you stay alone and don't invite God on the scene he'll whip you let me just tell you something about courage because I'm going to challenge you now in just in a moment courage is not fighting when you've got the strength courage is fighting when there is no strength to be found now every one of us are an individuals sitting here tonight you know what you've been fighting now you say well brother Ron I don't know so much about this as a convention meeting and you preach them fighting sermon yeah well I'm just paying attention to the boss because I'm not going to go back down the road tomorrow and tell him Lord I couldn't I couldn't preach what you wanted me to preach because that would have been too difficult I learned a long time ago if I preach what he wants me to preach he'll give me the strength so I told you that last night was the most difficult night that I have had in three and a half years Satan knew this punch was coming because no doubt he'd been watching across my shoulders as I was working and he knew that if I delivered the mail and you opened the mail and you read your name on the mail and you said I can overcome I hear the sound of freedom I hear a jubilee trumpet in the building I hear that slavery is over and I don't have to be a slave no longer amen now it's your turn last night from 12 o'clock to three o'clock I fought the enemy and I said Lord don't let me die in this bed I honestly prayed that Lord don't let me die in this bed I got a sermon to preach yeah if you give me the strength I preach the sermon there's some people came to the building decided do I go to church or don't go to church they can do that on Sunday morning I don't know if I got the strength to go to church or don't go to church listen if I can stand here before you fight what I'm fighting get yourself out of bed get up out of bed get your clothes on get up get up I want to finish with this if you have been knocked down I want to be in your corner get out don't you lay there you're a champion get out get up remember who you are get up get up you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are an invincible Lauren get out

that I want to just tell you you're still here you're still here you're still standing you're still Victorious brother on I just feel so feeble well let me just tell you about your strength for a little bit we're talking about tests of strength you got up out of your chair and it didn't matter who's on that internet watch it you raise your hand and you told the devil I don't care what you put against me I don't care what you put against me you can't stop me won't you say this with me the Jesus that's on the inside of you didn't stop walking toward Calgary he didn't say I surrender and I quit well they were nailing his nails in his hands he said father forgive them they know not what they do he didn't quit then he won't quit now he's been waiting since before the foundation of the world for you to come off of the pages of the Lamb's Book of Life for you to be standing here now you're here Satan couldn't stop you for 6 000 years he can't stop you now [Music] shamgar had been
