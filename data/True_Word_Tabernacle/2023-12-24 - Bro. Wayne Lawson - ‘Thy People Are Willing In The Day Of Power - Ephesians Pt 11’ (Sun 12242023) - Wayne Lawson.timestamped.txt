[0:39] Living God Amen who is here this morning
[0:43] that brother bandam said the same as he
[0:44] was that morning that Mary met him at
[0:46] the tomb that the two walked with him on
[0:49] the road to EMAs and he said there's a
[0:52] an inner charge of the new birth on the
[0:54] inside of you that can feel the presence
[0:57] as he moves through the church which is
[1:00] a witness of his resurrection power amen
[1:03] I'm so glad to know this morning that
[1:04] it's not just a story to us amen but we
[1:08] have had that Pentecostal blessing that
[1:11] is the Vindication of the resurrection
[1:13] of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and that

[1:42] Braham says you know Christmas falls in
[1:44] December said but it's not even close to
[1:46] the birthday of the Lord he said but
[1:48] just as sure as the lightning would
[1:50] strike in the darkness of night it
[1:52] proves there can be light in the middle
[1:54] of Darkness amen he said so it's a
[1:56] sacred time for us no matter if it was
[1:58] July or June or whenever it happens he
[2:01] said just remember if there had been no
[2:03] Christmas there'd be no
[2:05] Resurrection amen so we don't go into
[2:08] the world and all the things they do and
[2:10] follow after that but we're thankful for
[2:12] a savior this morning amen we're
[2:15] thankful amen that there was a Christmas
[2:17] amen so there could be a resurrection
[2:19] amen this morning we have a few things
[2:22] on our heart and just before we read the
[2:24] word maybe we just go to the Lord in a
[2:25] word of prayer there be something
[2:27] special that you have need with such an
[2:29] atmosphere like this I believe you can
[2:32] ask and receive Heavenly Father we thank

[2:37] the holy spirit that is just so real yes
[2:41] the power and Lord the very Vindication
[2:45] of your Resurrection still moving Lord

[2:56] the platform Lord and may you take your
[2:58] word and may you bless your children
[3:01] Lord and father I I thank you for the
[3:05] grace to be able to stand here today now
[3:08] we commit this service into thy faithful
[3:10] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[3:13] pray amen and amen and God bless you if
[3:17] you have your Bibles let's go to the
[3:19] book of Ephesians the first chapter and
[3:22] I want to read this 19 uh verse down to
[3:26] the uh 22nd verse and I do
[3:31] um uh not really probably got a
[3:34] Christmas message this morning you
[3:36] forgive me um there's just some things
[3:38] on her heart and amen and uh we'll we'll
[3:41] wrap it in there but uh there's just
[3:43] some things there's just some things uh
[3:45] that is dealing with me that I I just
[3:47] pray it' be a blessing to you amen uh
[3:51] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[3:53] 19 amen and what is the exceeding
[3:56] greatness of his power to us word who
[3:58] believe ACC according to the working of
[4:01] his mighty power which he wrought in
[4:04] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[4:06] and set him at his own right hand in
[4:08] Heavenly places now far above
[4:11] principality and power and might and
[4:13] dominion and every name that is named
[4:15] not only in the world but also in that
[4:18] which is to come and Heath put all
[4:21] things under his feet and gave him to be
[4:23] the head over all things to the
[4:26] church which is his body the fullness of
[4:29] of him that filth all in all amen we ask
[4:33] the Lord to bless his words you could be
[4:34] seated this morning amen I I want to
[4:37] take some of these uh thoughts from this
[4:39] context and I think it's very powerful
[4:42] uh to see here that the scriptures uh
[4:45] are are the way that they're written
[4:47] it's amazing how Paul says here if you
[4:49] go back to the 17th verse he prays that
[4:52] the god of the father would open give us
[4:54] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and
[4:56] the knowledge of him and then the next
[4:58] verse he asked that the eyes of our
[5:00] understanding being opened that we can
[5:02] see the power in US amen that he wasn't
[5:05] wanting us just to see amen uh the
[5:08] Revelation knowledge of God but that
[5:11] that he wanted us to see that how it
[5:14] works in our calling in our hopes and
[5:16] our inheritance in Christ now this
[5:19] morning I want to I want to speak to you
[5:20] a little bit and you you'll see a little
[5:22] more where I'm at but I want to take for
[5:24] a title a context this morning out of
[5:26] here and I want to talk to you thy
[5:28] people are willing in the day of power
[5:32] the people are willing in the day of
[5:35] power amen and so that's where I'm
[5:37] headed so if you can maybe hear this in
[5:39] the in the in the text uh I think it's a
[5:43] powerful thing to realize amen that if
[5:46] you can see Christ put on the throne if
[5:50] you can see his Ascension and by seeing
[5:53] his Ascension you can see all things
[5:55] that are dark has been placed under him
[5:58] every name that can be named has been
[6:00] placed under him and if you can ever see
[6:03] that as that that's what's positioned
[6:05] him there then you can turn around and
[6:07] look at yourself and then you can claim
[6:09] your right as a member of that glorified
[6:12] body and then we can also stand with all
[6:15] of our spiritual adversities below us
[6:19] because that you see him in that place
[6:21] then you can see yourself in that place
[6:23] because you're in that body amen one
[6:26] thing uh I I I I do know that we're
[6:28] never able to Lift Jesus too high
[6:31] because for as high as you lift the Lord
[6:33] Jesus you have also placed the church in
[6:36] the same place being that we are of his
[6:39] body and I love how that the prophet
[6:41] teaches us amen so we understand that we
[6:44] are of his body now uh I believe that
[6:47] what we have been given uh here in the
[6:49] Church of course is immeasurable and I
[6:52] believe that it's vast and I believe
[6:53] it's endless and and I could say
[6:56] incalculable and immense and it's Untold
[6:59] and it's massive and it's great and it's
[7:01] colossal and it's unlimited it's
[7:04] unconstrained it's bottomless Amen in
[7:06] other words when God begins to give to
[7:09] the church in his power it is an
[7:11] unlimited vastas uh without boundaries
[7:14] kind of power that he's given when you
[7:17] think of power brother mam always uses
[7:19] the Omni uh you could you could say the
[7:22] Omni uh uh uh of God you know he talks
[7:25] about omnipresence and he talks about
[7:27] omnipotence well when he talks about om
[7:29] omnipotence what omnipotence speaks of
[7:31] it speaks of all power amen uh brother
[7:35] Nathan actually quoted that from
[7:37] Thursday which that was a powerful
[7:38] sermon Thursday God bless you brother
[7:40] Nathan how many enjoyed that word amen
[7:43] amen if you U if you hadn't heard it uh
[7:48] as your pastor I'm asking you go listen
[7:50] to it amen and you visitors could hear
[7:52] it too get it it's a powerful sermon I
[7:54] sent it down to brother Josh spett He
[7:56] said brother Wayne that might be one of
[7:57] the top 10 I've heard in a long time I
[7:59] said it was powerful the only thing
[8:01] wrong with it it more people need to
[8:03] hear it amen amen but in in in
[8:06] omnipotence meaning amen that it is all
[8:09] power and and and I'll say this brother
[8:11] bam tells us that that's the power of
[8:14] God is all power see omnipotent power
[8:18] and then in the message uncertain sound
[8:20] brother Bram will take this and he will
[8:21] show that when these two begin to meet
[8:24] and and he'll take it he'll say see uh
[8:26] he talks about uh Martha when she's
[8:28] coming to the tomb and he says see these
[8:31] two omnipotence when they begin to meet
[8:33] he says one omnipotent she had she had a
[8:36] perfect omnipotent faith in Christ he
[8:39] said and Christ was omnipotent so she
[8:41] had a perfect in infinite faith in
[8:44] Christ and that he was the Lord and
[8:46] knowed whatever he asked God God would
[8:49] give see now see what her Revelation was
[8:51] he was God and whatever he wanted God
[8:54] would give because he was an authority
[8:56] he said see you just speak the word and
[8:59] all you have to do whatsoever you ask
[9:01] God God will give it she saw that amen
[9:04] then that's omnipotent power he says all
[9:07] right he was all powerful that's when
[9:10] two powers or two omnipotent Powers
[9:13] begin to meet together what you what in
[9:16] Ephesians chapter one you have to see
[9:18] these two together you have to see he's
[9:20] omnipotent but the church is omnipotent
[9:23] as well when they're placed within him
[9:25] it's an omnipotent faith in an
[9:27] omnipotent God now when we say this uh
[9:30] if you remember when we started these
[9:32] series we pulled up a uh three mysteries
[9:34] that brother Adam speaks about he speaks
[9:36] about the mystery of his coming the
[9:38] mystery of his will and the Mystery of a
[9:40] setting together you'all remember those
[9:41] three mysteries the mystery of his
[9:43] coming of course Elohim mdic that's the
[9:46] mystery of it and then the mystery of
[9:48] his will speaks of the adoption or the
[9:50] thoughts of God coming into the church
[9:53] but the third part of that mystery is us
[9:55] sitting together with God Amen in other
[9:58] words that these things will seat us in
[10:00] the presence of God Amen the word of
[10:03] life so they're setting us together now
[10:05] in Ephesians chapter 2 you'll see Paul
[10:08] will say this he says and he has raised
[10:10] us up together see two omnipotence he
[10:13] has raised us up together and made us
[10:16] sit together in Heavenly places in
[10:19] Christ Jesus you have to see that you're
[10:22] sitting
[10:23] together see that's what the church our
[10:26] hearts what we really need to see is
[10:29] that we're sitting together and I I
[10:31] think it's powerful to see that Jesus
[10:34] here as he's being lifted up Paul is
[10:36] saying that we might be able to see what
[10:38] is the the exceeding greatness of his
[10:42] power that works when God raised Jesus
[10:45] from the dead when you see that power
[10:47] that exceeding power that raised him
[10:50] from the dead body all the way to the
[10:52] throne of God then you can see the power
[10:56] that is working in you to bring you from
[10:59] a sinner all the way to the throne of
[11:01] God the same power that raised him from
[11:04] a dead cold body he put him in the
[11:08] Throne of God with everything under his
[11:11] feet that same power is the power that
[11:14] is in the believer that raises you from
[11:17] the world and makes you over all things
[11:21] in this life you said brother way I want
[11:23] that power that power is the power of
[11:25] the Resurrection it is the baptism of
[11:28] the Holy Ghost it's the power that will
[11:30] raise you up you see what Paul says in
[11:33] Ephesians chapter 3 and 19 and 20 he
[11:35] said now to know the love of Christ
[11:37] which passes knowledge that you may be
[11:39] filled with all the fullness of God now
[11:41] unto him that is able to do exceedingly
[11:44] and abundantly above all that we think
[11:47] or ask according to the power that
[11:50] worketh in us I love how Paul says that
[11:54] amen now here he's telling you in
[11:56] Ephesians 1 that we've got to see that
[11:58] power now he's says that that power
[12:00] which worketh in us can do exceedingly
[12:03] abundant whatever you think or ask this
[12:06] power that worketh in US is already
[12:08] there Colossians chapter 1 I love how
[12:10] Paul said I made a minister according to
[12:13] the dispensation of God given to me to
[12:15] fulfill the word of God he said even the
[12:18] mystery which had been heal from the
[12:19] ages and from Generations is now made
[12:22] manifest in the Saints to whom God would
[12:25] make known what is the riches of the
[12:27] glory of his mystery among the Gentiles
[12:31] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[12:35] whom we preach warning every man and
[12:39] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[12:41] may present you perfect in Christ Jesus
[12:44] wherefore I also labor striving
[12:48] according to his working which worketh
[12:51] mightily in me amen amen see what he's
[12:55] doing he's working according to that
[12:57] which is working within him which is the
[13:00] power that raised Jesus from the dead is
[13:03] the same power working in you it's the
[13:06] power amen that is making you do what
[13:08] you do amen it's not you that's doing
[13:11] the work it's Christ in you I love how
[13:13] brother Ram said it was personal
[13:15] identification right he said personally
[13:17] identified in you doing the things you
[13:19] couldn't do amen hating the things you
[13:22] used to love and loving the things you
[13:24] used to hate what power is that that's
[13:26] the same power that raised Jesus from
[13:28] the the dead is now working in the
[13:31] church amen see this working this
[13:33] working speaks of an energy in the
[13:36] church now I love how it because if you
[13:38] here in Colossians chapter 1 it speaks
[13:40] of the New Testament of course it's a
[13:42] Greek word and it's energist which means
[13:44] the state of being at work the energy or
[13:47] the efficiency it's a superhuman energy
[13:50] working in the church when Paul wrote
[13:53] this in the Greek he didn't say that
[13:54] energy is working in me such as like you
[13:57] had a little caffeine or you was in a
[13:59] good mood that's not the energy he's
[14:01] talking about working he said there's
[14:03] another energy it's a superhuman work
[14:06] working inside of me in other words
[14:08] there's a spirit that's went to work in
[14:10] my life that is a a superhuman thing
[14:13] that I I don't understand but it's the
[14:15] same power that raised Jesus from the
[14:17] dead and it's now working in me see
[14:20] according to Ephesians chapter 1 verse
[14:22] 19 he says he he he says I love how he
[14:25] says it he says it's his working of his
[14:28] strength and of his might that God works
[14:31] his strength and of his might this
[14:34] actually is only used in when you're
[14:37] speaking of God the working of strength
[14:39] in other words it's one thing to have
[14:41] strength it means an indwelling power so
[14:43] when you look at God and you can say
[14:45] well enemy is all power but you see when
[14:48] it comes to the church amen it's not
[14:51] just a power that is in God but it's a
[14:54] power that's exhibited by God in other
[14:57] words amen it's one thing for him to
[14:59] just have power but to not see that
[15:01] power work how would you know the power
[15:04] that resists in him but Paul is saying
[15:07] that we see the exceeding greatness of
[15:09] his power that is working in our life
[15:12] when you see Jesus raised from the dead
[15:14] that's the same power exhibited when God
[15:17] gets a hold of a Believer to raise him
[15:19] from the dead and I love it because you
[15:21] see it only speaks of relative and
[15:24] manifested power listen there is no
[15:27] power unless it's manifested power we
[15:29] don't know the power of God unless it's
[15:32] manifested power and we have seen the
[15:34] manifestation of the power of God in the
[15:37] resurrection of Jesus Christ my when I
[15:40] think about it the working of this
[15:42] strength it is to be connected with the
[15:44] exceeding greatness of his power the
[15:47] magnitude of God's power towards
[15:48] Believers is known in the operation of
[15:52] his
[15:53] strength I love how Paul says it he said
[15:56] I want to know him in the power of his
[15:58] resurrection I don't want to just know
[16:00] him in word I want to know him in the
[16:02] power of his resurrection I want to know
[16:05] him like that amen amen and the
[16:07] scripture says that's what raised him up
[16:09] and set him at his own right hand I I
[16:12] think of this today uh if you if you
[16:15] turn with me Ephesians chapter 1 it says
[16:16] set him at his own right hand in
[16:18] Heavenly places but turn with me to
[16:20] Psalms 110 and and we'll read the first
[16:23] four verses here this is David a
[16:25] psalmist when he's singing of the
[16:27] Messiah now I I I think that that of
[16:30] course this goes way through the
[16:31] scripture but let's just take a moment
[16:33] and watch the Scripture A Psalm of David
[16:36] the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at
[16:39] my right hand now here it is in
[16:42] Ephesians now you can see these guys
[16:44] listening to Paul this great Old
[16:47] Testament Theologian is now applying to
[16:52] Jesus the testimony of of Psalms 110
[16:56] that he would be set at the right hand
[16:58] now
[16:59] if you just hear this as a gentile well
[17:01] he set at the right hand of the father
[17:03] that don't mean a lot just as a gentile
[17:05] but as a Jew they knew that was a direct
[17:07] Messianic prophecy that MDC was to set
[17:11] as a as a priest in God's throne and
[17:14] watch what he says in Psalm of David the
[17:16] Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my
[17:18] right hand until I make thine enemies
[17:20] thy foot stol for the Lord shall send
[17:23] the rod of the strength of Zion and rule
[17:25] in the midst of thine enemies and the
[17:27] people shall be willing in the day of
[17:30] thy power there's my title there amen
[17:32] the people shall be willing in the day
[17:35] of thy power and in the beauty of
[17:37] Holiness from the womb of the morning
[17:39] thou Hast to do of thy youth for the
[17:41] Lord has sworn isn't that powerful for
[17:44] the Lord has sworn and will not repent
[17:47] thou art a priest Forever After the
[17:50] order of mcedc now we're talking about
[17:53] in that day David singing this under
[17:57] inspiration he saw that his own son
[18:00] would be his Lord he saw the son of
[18:02] David would be his own Lord amen I tell
[18:05] you what a how did David keep it in amen
[18:08] but as he began to sing this amen thou
[18:11] the song he began to sing now it was
[18:14] when Jesus first mentions this in
[18:16] Matthew 22 when Jesus himself picks up
[18:19] this same prophecy and begins to apply
[18:22] it unto Christ look what he says he said
[18:24] what think you of Christ whose son is he
[18:28] let you say unto him the son of David he
[18:31] saith unto them how then David in the
[18:34] spirit calls him Lord saying the Lord
[18:37] said to my Lord sit thou on my right
[18:39] hand till I make thine enemies thy
[18:40] foottoo if David then call him Lord amen
[18:44] how is he his son but the if if you're
[18:47] reading this what What's Happening Here
[18:49] is David Jesus says that David under
[18:52] inspiration called him his son his Lord
[18:56] David got under inspiration and saw that
[19:00] Jesus wouldn't just be the son of David
[19:03] that he would be the Lord Of Glory and
[19:05] he knew that he was a priest like they
[19:08] had priest but this would be a different
[19:10] kind of priest this would be a god
[19:12] priest this would be a king priest this
[19:15] what God was becoming a priest amen what
[19:18] he was doing is David had knew this but
[19:21] Jesus is starting to identify this with
[19:24] himself now David was a powerful he was
[19:26] a prophet and a pssst but in the uh in
[19:29] Psalms chapter 16 now we're reading
[19:31] Prophecies of Jesus sitting at the right
[19:33] hand Amen in Psalms 16 verse 8 watch
[19:37] this for I have set the lord always
[19:40] before me because he is at my right hand
[19:44] and I shall not be moved therefore is my
[19:47] heart glad and my glory rejoices and my
[19:51] flesh shall Rest In Hope for thou will
[19:53] not suffer th will not leave my soul in
[19:55] Hell neither without thou suffer the
[19:56] Holy One to see corruption th th will
[19:59] show me the path of life and in the
[20:00] presence of Joy at thy right hand are
[20:04] Pleasures forever more now isn't that
[20:07] something David hundreds of years before
[20:10] Paul writes Ephesians chapter 1 said
[20:13] this mecdc this son this virgin born son
[20:17] will sit at the right hand of God and he
[20:19] will be the ambassador of the human race
[20:22] he will be the king that takes the
[20:24] kingdom for the human race and puts all
[20:27] enemies amen of Adam race under his feet
[20:30] and David saw this and he knew he would
[20:32] have to be a human but he knew he would
[20:34] be a different kind of human he knew he
[20:36] would be a God man and he knew he would
[20:39] have to die but he would never see
[20:41] corruption because he was the only one
[20:43] of God and the same power that would let
[20:45] him go in the grave would also raise him
[20:47] up and set him at the right hand of God
[20:50] where he would rule Supreme over
[20:52] everything because he is the king of
[20:54] kings and he is the Lord of lords I'm
[20:57] talking about Jesus Christ the son of
[21:00] God who sits at the right hand of God
[21:02] today listen folks amen I think we ought
[21:05] to blow a trumpet and tell all of Hell
[21:07] there is one of us on the throne of God
[21:11] one of my kind a humankind a man is on
[21:15] the throne of God my puts this church in
[21:19] power if you can see your own what if
[21:22] you can see your own husband sitting on
[21:24] the throne amen you would know that you
[21:26] share that Throne because he's your
[21:28] husband he's not just our King he's not
[21:31] just our Lord he's our savior but he's
[21:33] also the husband of the church and we
[21:36] are connected to the throne of God I
[21:39] love how he says it here in Mark 16
[21:41] y'all forgive me I might not be able to
[21:43] SP to teach much I this is all over me
[21:46] amen Mark 16 in the 19th verse so then
[21:49] after the Lord has spoken unto them he
[21:52] was received up into heaven these are
[21:54] not Disney stories folks this is reality
[21:57] amen they watch him being received into
[21:59] heaven and he sat at the right hand of
[22:03] God yes sir therefore they went and
[22:05] preached
[22:07] everywhere look they they saw the
[22:09] heavens receive him and they knew he was
[22:12] to set at the right hand of God and they
[22:14] went forth and preached everywhere the
[22:16] Lord working with them and confirming
[22:20] what their words with signs and
[22:23] wonders I tell you what if you ever see
[22:25] him on the throne and you're
[22:27] representing him you'll know there's
[22:29] something backing this word
[22:31] up we're not just a bunch of preachers
[22:33] out here saying things who are empty
[22:35] words there's somebody on the throne
[22:37] that's backing these things up amen now
[22:41] in the book of Acts Peter uses the same
[22:43] scripture if you go to Acts chapter 7 in
[22:46] the 23rd verse it's a little lengthy but
[22:48] we'll see how much of it here in the
[22:50] 23rd verse this is the Peter's sermon
[22:52] he's saying being delivered by the
[22:54] determined counsel the forn knowledge of
[22:56] God he have taken and by Wicked hands
[22:59] crucified and slain whom God hath raised
[23:02] up and having loose the Pains of death
[23:04] because it was not possible that he
[23:05] should be holding of it for David speak
[23:08] concerning him I foresaw the Lord before
[23:11] my face for he is my right hand and I
[23:13] shall not be moved see now now Peter is
[23:16] taking the exact prophecy of Psalm 16
[23:20] therefore did my heart Rejoice my tongue
[23:22] glad moreover My Flesh shall Rest In
[23:24] Hope because thou will not suffer my
[23:26] Holy One to see corruption thou H has
[23:29] made known to me the ways of life thou
[23:31] shall make full of joy with thy
[23:33] countenance men and Brethren let me
[23:36] freely speak unto you of the patriarch
[23:38] David that is both dead and
[23:40] buried and his supper is with us unto
[23:43] this day therefore being a prophet and
[23:45] knowing that God had swor with an oath
[23:47] that of the fruit of loins according to
[23:49] the flesh he would raise up Christ to
[23:51] set on his throne he seeing this before
[23:55] spoke of the Resurrection that his soul
[23:57] was not left in Hell neither his flesh
[23:59] did see corruption this Jesus God hath
[24:02] raised wherefore we are all Witnesses
[24:06] therefore being by the right hand of God
[24:09] exalted and having received of the
[24:11] Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he
[24:13] shed forth this which you now see and
[24:17] hear amen now they were watching this
[24:20] demonstration of the Holy Spirit and
[24:22] he's saying he put this here that you're
[24:24] now seeing and hearing he shed this
[24:27] forth which you now seeing here for this
[24:30] David is not ascended un the heavens but
[24:32] he saith himself the Lord said it my
[24:35] unto my Lord set thou on my right hand
[24:37] till I make thine enemies thy foottoo
[24:39] therefore let all the house of Israel
[24:42] assuredly know that the God hath made
[24:45] the same Jesus whom you crucified both
[24:48] Lord and
[24:51] Christ isn't that amazing amen can you
[24:55] can you imagine sitting there and
[24:56] they're seeing all this disturbance and
[24:58] they're saying what meth these things
[25:00] and Peter actually just says what
[25:02] happened is y'all killed the Lord Of
[25:04] Glory and God had raised him up and set
[25:07] him at the right hand as he promised
[25:09] that they would do and now because he's
[25:11] at the right hand of God he's sending
[25:14] forth this spirit that you're now
[25:15] witnessing amen and and couldn't we
[25:18] preach the same sermon this morning he
[25:20] said what is all this noise and what is
[25:22] all the commotion what is all this going
[25:25] on well let me tell you they crucified
[25:27] the Lord Jesus and on the third day God
[25:29] raised him up and he ascended under the
[25:32] heavens and set at the right hand of God
[25:34] and this that you do see it here is
[25:36] because my Jesus is both Lord and Christ
[25:40] and he says this morning in power and in
[25:43] reality listen Jesus Is Not Dead Jesus
[25:46] is not an imagination Jesus is a Son of
[25:49] God that sits on the throne of God and
[25:52] he's ruling this morning for the
[25:53] children of God that we do not have to
[25:56] come here to a powerless religion
[25:59] hallelujah hallelujah wo Glory he set
[26:02] him at his own right
[26:04] hand amen I don't want to cover you up
[26:06] with scripture but if you got your
[26:08] Bibles or you want to just come along
[26:10] Hebrews 12 and verse 2 Paul says again
[26:13] he endured the cross despising the same
[26:15] shame and is sat down at the Throne of
[26:19] God in First Peter Peter says he has
[26:22] gone into heaven and is on the right
[26:24] hand of God and angels and authorities
[26:27] and Powers
[26:28] are made subject unto him in Hebrews 1
[26:31] and3 he was the brightness of his glory
[26:34] the expressed image of his person
[26:36] upholding All Things by the word of his
[26:37] power when he had by himself purged our
[26:40] sins he sat down on the right hand of
[26:44] the Majesty on high in Hebrews 8 Paul
[26:47] says he said now of things which he has
[26:49] spoken of in this son we have such a
[26:51] high priest who is set on the right hand
[26:54] of the Throne of the Majesty on high in
[26:57] Hebrews chapter 10 Paul brings it down
[27:00] he says but this man after he had
[27:02] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[27:05] sat down on the right hand of God
[27:07] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[27:10] made his foottoo look at that he ties it
[27:12] right back to Psalms 110 amen for by one
[27:15] offering he perfected forever them that
[27:17] are Sanctified wherefore the Holy Ghost
[27:19] is also a witness to us for after that
[27:22] he had had said before now it's not till
[27:26] you get to Hebrews 7 that it gets so
[27:29] absolutely plain that you cannot that
[27:31] you cannot defer nor deny unless you
[27:34] deny the whole Bible that Jesus Christ
[27:37] became that MDC became Jesus Christ now
[27:41] brother Ram said that Jesus wasn't mcedc
[27:43] he said but mcedc became Jesus Christ is
[27:47] that right now if you read Hebrews 7
[27:50] you'll see that he was a man when he met
[27:52] Abraham right but not a virgin born son
[27:55] brother said a created being he just
[27:57] took dust and blew it and stepped into
[27:59] it and talked with him he said there he
[28:00] was the word mcedc talking to Abraham
[28:04] visiting with him right amen now that
[28:07] that meaned that visited with him he
[28:10] said but but he said watch but he was a
[28:12] man without beginning of days or ending
[28:14] of life and brother BR said whoever that
[28:16] is he's still alive tonight amen without
[28:19] beginning of days or ending of Life he's
[28:21] still alive tonight amen and he still
[28:23] the word and in the beginning was the
[28:26] word and the Word was with God and the
[28:28] the word became flesh and we beheld his
[28:30] glory as the only begotten Son of God
[28:33] isn't that amazing amen that that word
[28:35] became flesh the word who was MDC became
[28:39] flesh in the man Jesus Christ and Paul
[28:42] caught the Revelation and begin to lay
[28:45] out to the church that this AR onic
[28:47] priesthood out here that's making all
[28:49] these sacrifices they're only
[28:52] sacrificing every year because their
[28:54] sacrifices don't have power to remove
[28:56] your sins we only keep this tradition up
[28:59] because there's nothing that can remove
[29:01] the sins but he said but but oh God we
[29:03] have another priest amen and and the
[29:06] Bible said nothing of a priest coming
[29:09] out of Judah amen but there was a son to
[29:12] come out of Judah there was a ruler to
[29:15] come out of Judah amen mdct himself Wass
[29:18] to descend into the humanity by a virgin
[29:22] birth to become a priest for her you and
[29:24] I Hallelujah my goodness amen I I say I
[29:28] say Hebrews chapter 7 watch Paul he said
[29:30] therefore Perfection whereby the
[29:31] levitical priesthood and under the
[29:33] people received the law what further
[29:35] need was there for any other priest to
[29:37] rise after the order of
[29:39] mcedc and not called after the order of
[29:42] Aaron isn't that something if everything
[29:45] was okay then why did we have another
[29:47] priest amen but for the priesthood
[29:51] changed and that made a necessity also
[29:54] for a change of the law for he whom a
[29:58] things were spoken pertaineth another
[29:59] tribe of which no man gave attendance at
[30:02] the altar for it is evident that our
[30:04] Lord sprang out of Judah which tribe
[30:07] Moses spoke nothing concerning
[30:09] priesthood and yet it is far more
[30:12] evident that after the similitude of
[30:14] mecdc there ariseth another priest so
[30:18] Paul is taking Jesus and mecdc and
[30:22] putting them together as the one who
[30:24] sits at the right hand of God Amen and
[30:27] he's showing you he was made not after
[30:30] the law of carnal commandment but after
[30:32] the power of an endless life this priest
[30:35] that we have did not come from the law
[30:37] of carnal commandment it didn't come
[30:39] from the law of Moses it come out of the
[30:42] Endless life and that today look folks
[30:45] amen whether you know it or not you are
[30:47] a kingdom of priest you are a priesthood
[30:50] of God and you're not under the law of
[30:52] carnal commandment but under the power
[30:55] of an endless life our priest never
[30:58] dies and the power of our priesthood is
[31:01] just as real are to priest Forever After
[31:03] the order of mcedc and there is verily
[31:06] disano of the Commandment before the
[31:07] weakness and unproffesional
[31:28] and will not repent thou art a priest
[31:30] Forever After the order of mecdc he said
[31:33] the priest you have that you're trusting
[31:35] to take away your sins every year
[31:37] they're made without an oath right amen
[31:40] they're is coming under the carnal
[31:41] Commandments they was without an oath
[31:43] but this Jesus was made by an oath for
[31:46] God himself said I swear and will not
[31:49] repent that there shall come a priest
[31:51] after the order of
[31:52] mecdc God himself would become your
[31:55] priest and he wouldn't have to offer
[31:57] many sacrifices but he would offer
[31:59] himself the blood of his own body he
[32:03] would offer one time and sit down at the
[32:05] right hand of God and perfect forever
[32:07] them that are Sanctified I tell you what
[32:09] this morning there is no greater
[32:11] priesthood there is nothing greater than
[32:13] what God has done for the church amen I
[32:15] won't finish reading that but you can
[32:17] read Hebrews 7 in Romans chapter 8 Paul
[32:20] said it he said who is it then that
[32:23] condemneth it is Christ that died now
[32:26] we've just spent some time to prove
[32:27] Christ was mdct it is Christ that died
[32:31] rather that is risen again who is even
[32:34] at the right hand of God making
[32:36] intercession for us who can condemn a
[32:39] man when the elct is his
[32:44] priest amen who can lay anything to the
[32:47] charge of God's
[32:48] elect for it is God that justifies thank
[32:52] you Lord Jesus my goodness when you when
[32:54] you see the reality that look at Paul
[32:56] when he says in Colossians if you be
[32:58] risen in Christ seek the things which
[33:00] are above where Christ sth at the right
[33:03] hand of God the Bible says here in Peter
[33:06] amen that he's went under Heavens now
[33:08] now if you're if you're following this
[33:10] line in scripture and you get to
[33:11] Revelations the third chapter you get in
[33:14] the 21st verse you'll see that Jesus
[33:17] actually says to you to him that
[33:20] overcometh will I grant to set with me
[33:23] in my throne even as I overcame and sit
[33:28] down with my father in his
[33:31] throne as he did it by an oath by the
[33:35] power of God so can the church do it by
[33:39] oath and the power of God as he overcame
[33:43] so can you overcome now I know today I
[33:46] know that there's a lot of I know
[33:47] there's a lot of self-help books and I
[33:49] know probably some of them help some
[33:50] people I'm sure amen but but I will say
[33:53] this there ain't no self-help getting
[33:55] you to that Throne that's right matter
[33:58] of fact it'll take death to self to get
[34:00] to where I'm talking
[34:02] about now the Hindus they were blown
[34:05] away of the Gospel there in India and
[34:07] I'll tell you why because they believe
[34:09] you need 10 new births to get to the
[34:11] highest Ascension of their religion they
[34:14] think you have to live 10 good lives one
[34:16] after the other mess up about three way
[34:18] in you go back one and you go amen it's
[34:21] it's perpetual life and according to the
[34:23] way you lived in this life you go
[34:24] backwards and forwards but you can't get
[34:27] there any shorter than 10 births amen
[34:29] but it's amazing when you come to the
[34:31] gospel that Paul is teaching us that one
[34:35] New Birth can put a man on the throne of
[34:38] God sharing in power and authority and
[34:42] listen there's nothing higher than man
[34:44] with God in him that's why God quit
[34:47] creating in the Garden of Eden he went
[34:50] so high and he quit creating why because
[34:52] he reached the Apex of creation he
[34:55] created a man in the image of God God
[34:58] there is nothing higher come on are you
[35:00] hearing me there is nothing higher and
[35:03] he was raised to sit on the throne of
[35:04] God with all things under his feet
[35:06] because Jesus is the highest level of
[35:10] Life angels and demons and
[35:13] principalities and powers and all things
[35:15] were put under his feet and you were
[35:17] born Sons and Daughters of God there is
[35:20] nothing higher when you recognize who
[35:23] you are there is no Throne No Dominion
[35:26] there's no devil there's no disease
[35:28] there is no power there is nothing
[35:30] higher than a Son of God with the
[35:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the
[35:35] highest form of
[35:37] life I know people look at us and all
[35:40] holy rollers and all and that bunch of
[35:42] fanaticism and they put you down because
[35:45] they think but brother if you ever see
[35:46] the reality of it you have been set in
[35:49] the highest of
[35:50] heights and everything else is beneath
[35:54] it woo
[35:56] Glory
[35:58] now now TR trinitarians I'm sorry I'm
[36:03] loaded I've been studying it it's on my
[36:05] heart I can't help it but but Trin TR
[36:09] trinitarians they they try to use
[36:11] scripture to prove as more than one God
[36:14] right so they'll take scriptures like
[36:16] this he sits at the right hand and then
[36:19] they'll take Revelations 5 brother B
[36:21] deals with the church M book and the
[36:23] lamb came and took the book out of the
[36:25] hand of him that sat on the throne and
[36:28] brother B says see indeed in these
[36:30] isolated verses you could believe
[36:33] there's more than one he said you could
[36:35] prove your point isolated verses he said
[36:38] but read Revelation chter
[36:40] 4 and go in the second and third verse
[36:43] in the nth and 11th verse and watch Thou
[36:45] Art Worthy oh Lord to receive honor and
[36:47] glory and power for thou has created all
[36:50] things and the pleasure thou art created
[36:52] now carefully note verse two it says one
[36:55] not
[36:56] two one one sat on the throne in verse
[37:00] three he says he not they were to look
[37:03] on as jasper stone and verse n it says
[37:06] the Beast gave honor to him not them in
[37:09] verse 10 it says and that the elders
[37:11] fell down and worshiped him not them in
[37:14] verse 11 it says and that they cried
[37:16] Thou Art Worthy oh Lord not Lords see in
[37:19] verse 11 it says one on the throne was a
[37:21] Creator which is
[37:23] Jesus which is Jehovah Spirit god of the
[37:27] old Testament amen
[37:29] my I'm reading the church book joh
[37:32] Genesis chapter 1 now he says see that's
[37:35] the thing if you read it let's go to
[37:37] Revelations three to him that overcometh
[37:39] what I grant to set in my throne even as
[37:41] I have overcome and sat down with my
[37:43] father in his throne and then he goes of
[37:46] course to Hebrews 12 and verse 2 he said
[37:49] despising the shame of the Cross he has
[37:51] set down in other words the reward was
[37:53] to set at the right hand but notice
[37:54] According To Jesus himself who wrote the
[37:56] revelation
[37:58] he has sat down with the
[38:00] father and Paul which the spirit of
[38:03] Christ the spirit of Prophecy it was on
[38:05] Paul says he sat down at the right hand
[38:08] of God Amen see Jesus said as I have
[38:12] overcame and I am sit down in my
[38:16] father's Throne do you see what he say
[38:18] I'm sitting on my father's throne but
[38:20] Paul in in the spirit of Prophecy said
[38:23] he sits at the right hand of God see now
[38:26] what's he doing he's setting at the
[38:27] right hand but when John looked he only
[38:29] saw one he says see what he's saying to
[38:33] you is Revelations 5 follows Revelations
[38:35] 3 he set you up to see there was one God
[38:38] and then he showed the actions amen of
[38:41] two people but it's offices of God right
[38:44] and that what is it brother R said the
[38:46] mystery of one God he came Jesus came
[38:49] out of God became manifested In the
[38:51] Flesh and died and rose again and the
[38:54] and then returned to the bosom of the
[38:58] father my goodness the only begotten son
[39:01] which is in the bosom of the father he
[39:03] had declared him John 1 and18 what was
[39:06] it see he had declared him what was
[39:09] going on he come out of God he went back
[39:12] into God Jesus said I have come from God
[39:16] and I go back to God do you see when
[39:18] Paul sees this he sees the right hand
[39:22] but but brother brandom really gives us
[39:24] the reality he said the right hand only
[39:28] signifies power and
[39:30] authority that's what happened in
[39:32] Matthew 17 when the spirit of God came
[39:34] down and said this is my beloved Son in
[39:36] whom I'm well pleased hear ye him he
[39:41] gave him all power and all authority and
[39:44] Jesus himself said all power in Heaven
[39:46] and Earth is given unto me then brother
[39:49] Bram says if there's another God up
[39:51] there he said he's powerless yeah amen
[39:54] do you see what it is now he extended
[39:58] that power to the
[40:00] church what good would it do for him to
[40:03] set in power unless he was giving power
[40:06] from the throne he Seth in the right
[40:08] hand now you can see that he did not
[40:11] just take it for himself and I think
[40:13] this is powerful points now he didn't
[40:15] just take it for himself but the Bible
[40:18] itself declares in the revelations that
[40:21] he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[40:24] amen so Jesus didn't just take power and
[40:27] Authority and then hold it into the
[40:29] heavens but he gave it back on the earth
[40:32] and he sent Seven Stars upon the Earth
[40:35] and these Seven Stars were seven
[40:37] Messengers amen and those Messengers
[40:39] begin to receive the spirit and
[40:41] authority of God and he backed them up
[40:45] he says he put all power into them what
[40:48] was he doing he was showing his
[40:50] delivering power on the earth because he
[40:54] is in
[40:56] heaven now now I I just want to maybe
[40:59] maybe could we could we just travel and
[41:01] Wyatt could be Shepherds we'll we'll
[41:02] help the Christmas folks here for a
[41:03] moment why why it had to be Shepherds
[41:07] Heen uh you know um I'm
[41:11] kidding uh and why it had to be
[41:13] Shepherds you know Moses comes up
[41:16] there and God tells Moses from the
[41:19] burning bush to go down and deliver the
[41:23] people but Moses said Lord I'm not going
[41:26] to go down there without you showing me
[41:28] your glory yeah see I'm I'm not going to
[41:31] go down there cuz I can't even
[41:33] talk I'm not going to they're not going
[41:35] to believe me I I I I can't do anything
[41:38] when I get
[41:39] there and God told him he'd give him two
[41:42] signs watch and he shows him his glory
[41:44] brother Bram illustrates this why I had
[41:45] to be Shepherds I won't slow down and
[41:47] read a bunch but I'll I'll say what
[41:49] brother Bram said he said but watch how
[41:52] Moses became God Amen right Moses Moes
[41:57] became God before the burning bush he
[42:01] said now God told Moses to put his hand
[42:04] into his bosom brother BR said now we
[42:07] have no reason to believe Moses was
[42:09] left-handed he said so we believe he put
[42:12] his right hand into his bosom he said
[42:16] which was a type of God the Father
[42:19] taking his right hand over his heart
[42:22] where all of his secrets were hid amen
[42:26] he said that right right hand was Jesus
[42:28] and he said watch when he pulls it out
[42:31] it's in the last stages of leprosy it's
[42:34] already in the last stages now brother
[42:35] man said why was it so far Advanced he
[42:38] said because that's exactly where the
[42:40] world was standing he said the when
[42:43] Jesus came on the earth sin had already
[42:46] taken its toll and they were in the last
[42:49] stages of death he said and here comes
[42:51] out of the bosom of God his right hand
[42:55] to show where the sin symptoms are in
[42:58] the world he said but then God reveals
[43:00] the secret to the answer he restores it
[43:03] back into his hand his bosom and when he
[43:06] pulls it out the second time he said
[43:09] there's no leprosy on it showing that
[43:13] God taking Jesus from his bosom and
[43:16] returning him to his bosom would be the
[43:18] thing that would totally destroy the
[43:20] leprosy of sin Let me say something to
[43:23] you this morning sin has already been
[43:26] defeated
[43:27] leprosy has already been
[43:30] defeated look look how quick it happened
[43:33] brother B said that day you eat shall
[43:34] surely die sin came that quick he said
[43:37] but look at how quick it left when he
[43:39] pulled his hand out it was all over he
[43:42] said and when Jesus was on the cross he
[43:44] said it is finished and it's all over
[43:47] amen but what did he do he returned his
[43:50] bosom he turned his right hand to his
[43:52] bosom now brother R said There It Is He
[43:54] said Jesus came to the Earth killed and
[43:57] paid the debts of sin but when was
[44:00] finished he returned to the bosom of the
[44:03] father now this powerful to me I don't
[44:06] have time to read them I wish I did but
[44:07] he said he returned to the bosom of the
[44:09] father and he said from there amen watch
[44:13] he extended his hand to the Believers
[44:17] look what Moses did when he saw the
[44:19] supernatural he didn't stay up on the
[44:22] mountain by himself he didn't stay up
[44:24] there at the pillar fire rejoicing in
[44:26] his experience with the right hand of
[44:29] God but he was sent down to deliver the
[44:32] children of God to bring the omnipotent
[44:35] power which he had saw to deliver the
[44:37] Church of the Living God it's written in
[44:40] the scripture for I will deliver thee
[44:42] with a mighty hand it wasn't the hand of
[44:45] Moses that delivered the children of God
[44:47] it was God's hand that delivered them
[44:49] and it's the hand of God this morning
[44:51] that delivers the church put thy hand in
[44:54] thy bosom and restore when he pulled his
[44:57] hand back out that secret that had been
[45:00] in God's bosom all these years was
[45:02] covered by his right hand that was Jesus
[45:04] he was wounded for our transgressions
[45:07] that right hand was drawn the second
[45:09] time and it had no sin brother Bram said
[45:12] oh it was finished God's right hand from
[45:15] his bosom then on Easter he returned it
[45:18] and and raised it up again and extended
[45:21] it down to you and I in the form of his
[45:25] word
[45:27] my goodness the hand returned in the
[45:31] form of his word brother Bram said no
[45:34] wonder it was that the mountains jumped
[45:37] for Joy he said no wonder it was the sin
[45:40] the sun hit his face and screamed for
[45:43] Joy no wonder nature broke loose and the
[45:45] wind Shook and the trees Shook and they
[45:48] joyed and they jumped they seen the
[45:50] prophet Shepherd on the mountain oh God
[45:52] redeem every name on The Book of Life
[45:55] and their own nature was redeemed they
[45:57] screamed they jumped and the world went
[45:59] into an earthquake and the mountains
[46:00] rink and the Rocks fell out and the sun
[46:03] went down and everything like any
[46:07] meeting when the shepherd reveals to you
[46:10] it's
[46:12] finished brother man he takes he takes
[46:15] all of that he says like in any meeting
[46:18] he says when you see the shepherd
[46:20] reveals to you it's finished I've seen
[46:22] jumping spells and joy spells y'all
[46:24] remember this quote sir it's amazing
[46:26] where where he's putting it I've seen
[46:28] jumping spells and joy spells and the
[46:30] mountains rung out the sun went down and
[46:32] everything took place he said oh but
[46:34] there was nobody hurt I've seen meetings
[46:37] where the power of God was revealed to
[46:39] the people and they were free from the
[46:41] world and the things of the world and
[46:42] the joy of the Lord filled the
[46:44] congregation they stood and screamed and
[46:47] cried and shouted to the top of their
[46:49] voice for the glory of God I never did
[46:51] see anything disorderly they was always

[47:24] why did he have to come to Shepherds
[47:27] he said cuz nobody else would humble
[47:29] themselves to it because the the very
[47:32] lamb was being born in a manure pile so
[47:35] the church has to be ready to stink like
[47:38] the animals to be looked at to be cast
[47:41] down to be talked about to be a fanatic

[50:14] that has raised the church from the dead
[50:17] and has put itself on the throne and
[50:19] heart of every believer and he shall
[50:21] come from there you said brother Wayne I
[50:22] don't know about this well I I'll give
[50:24] you a scripture in Hebrews chapter 4
[50:26] Paul says these things are an allegory
[50:29] yeah he said see he speaks of of of two
[50:33] mountains Mount SII which is in Arabia
[50:35] he said in answer to Jerusalem which now
[50:37] is is in bondage of her children but
[50:40] Jerusalem which is free is from above
[50:41] which is the mother of us all he was
[50:43] using allegories of cities as

[50:54] sure now where have we come
[50:59] to when you when you when you come into

[51:09] is no separation there
[51:12] right somebody said well did Paul have
[51:15] everything but but Paul put put it there
[51:17] brother Brown brought it to Revelation
[51:19] sir okay but but where have you come to
[51:23] when you come into this Paul says it in
[51:25] Hebrews 12 you didn't come to the mount
[51:29] that cannot be touched remember the
[51:31] Mountain of Fire where they couldn't
[51:32] touch it and anything touch it had to
[51:33] die Paul said in the 18th verse you
[51:36] didn't come to that
[51:37] mountain but he turns around and he says
[51:41] but you are come to the Mount
[51:43] Zion and unto the city of the Living God
[51:47] the heavenly Jerusalem to an enable
[51:49] company of angels to the general
[51:51] assembly in the Church of the firstborn
[51:53] which are written in heaven
[51:57] now watch what he continues and God the
[51:59] judge of all to the spirits of just men
[52:01] made perfect and to
[52:04] Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant and
[52:07] the blood of sprinkling that speaketh
[52:09] better things than that of Abel now you
[52:11] say preacher what do you saying now
[52:13] watch watch watch what Psalms is
[52:15] teaching and out of Zion shall come the
[52:17] rod of thy strength and thou shalt set
[52:18] upon thine holy heel watch what he's
[52:21] what's what he's teaching us this Rod of
[52:23] strength is speaking of the Gospel yeah
[52:26] it's speaking of the strength of the
[52:28] Holy Ghost coming out now many times it
[52:30] was spoke of watch brother Bram over in
[52:32] Isaiah 28 he picks up the sixth verse
[52:34] and brother said the spirit of judgment
[52:35] to him that Seth in judgment and for
[52:38] strength to them that turn the battle
[52:40] brother said there it is to him that
[52:42] will stand in the gate for the battle
[52:44] his strength is the Holy
[52:46] Ghost he said and how does his strength
[52:48] come with stammering lips and other
[52:50] tongues will I speak you unto my people
[52:52] and this is the rest wherein I cause the
[52:54] weary to rest amen the strength of the
[52:58] church is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:01] amen
[53:03] amen amen I believe it I believe the
[53:05] Holy Ghost already to be in the
[53:08] Pulpit I believe that because I believe
[53:11] a lot of what's wrong with this loudy in
[53:13] the age that we're living in is weak
[53:16] pulpits come on how do you preach an
[53:19] experience when you never had one how
[53:21] can you teach people how to receive the
[53:23] Holy Ghost when you never had it how can
[53:26] you get strength to overcome when you've
[53:28] never overcame how can you preach it
[53:30] when you don't know it the weakness of
[53:32] the pull pit has brought a weak
[53:34] generation amen but if there is strength
[53:37] in the house of the Lord if there is
[53:39] strength coming out of Zion there will
[53:41] be a congregation with strength in them
[53:44] strength to resist the devil strength to
[53:46] fight because they know where their
[53:48] strength is coming from amen amen I
[53:53] could preach a long time on strength
[53:54] sorry but all right
[53:57] now the gospel is the arm of the Lord
[53:59] right in P son Isaiah 53 said for the
[54:02] arm of the Lord yes who hath believ our
[54:05] report who has believed the arm of the
[54:07] report now when this report comes it
[54:09] does not come
[54:12] powerless the gospel doesn't come
[54:15] powerless folks right amen it says I am
[54:18] not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for
[54:21] it is the power of God under salvation
[54:24] to everyone that believes I know we got
[54:27] stacks of books these days of steps to
[54:29] become a Christian listen amen the
[54:32] gospel is the way the power of God is
[54:34] the way the Holy Ghost is the way it's
[54:37] the way back it's the way back to our
[54:40] Authority it's the power of God listen
[54:43] to the Jew first and also to the Greek
[54:45] first Thessalonians Paul amen that great
[54:48] scholarly man yeah Paul was a scholar
[54:52] but he said Our Gospel came not unto you
[54:54] in word only but in also in power and in
[54:58] the Holy Ghost with much
[54:59] Assurance Paul didn't believe just in a
[55:02] in a in a little teaching sermon and let
[55:04] people walk away with their lives ruined
[55:06] and and they couldn't get healing and
[55:08] couldn't get deliverance and they
[55:09] couldn't come on we've taught over a lot
[55:11] of things in our ages people you can
[55:13] teach over little things you can just
[55:15] teach it and it'll go right over the
[55:16] congregation but you turn that Holy
[55:18] Ghost loose preaching in a church one
[55:20] time and then it'll turn over every Rock
[55:23] people might get mad they might get
[55:24] upset but the Holy Ghost ghost is still
[55:26] a discerner of the thought and the
[55:28] intents of the heart and it'll go right
[55:30] to where you're living the god of David
[55:33] is still the God of this bride and if he
[55:36] could take a rock and throw it and God
[55:38] could make it hit the right place and I
[55:40] believe a gospel preacher in this age
[55:42] amen amen he might not sound like much
[55:45] but all he's got to do is throw the
[55:46] Revelation and let God direct it to the
[55:49] heart of the
[55:51] enemy come on church I don't believe in
[55:53] a weak backbone church I don't believe a
[55:56] weakness of the church and just
[55:58] intellectual and Theology and a drive
[56:00] now I don't believe it anybody believe
[56:02] what they want to but I believe God has
[56:04] raised up a Powerhouse I believe the
[56:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost was sent to
[56:09] put Power in the
[56:14] church I don't want to fight that fight
[56:16] so let it go the gospel came not through
[56:19] Us in word only but through
[56:22] manifestation and demonstration of the
[56:23] spirit brother man said God help us to
[56:25] believe the same thing
[56:27] here God help us to believe the same
[56:31] thing amen that's exactly what it was
[56:35] the Commandment of God was to go into
[56:36] the world and preach the gospel not to
[56:39] teach not to set up
[56:44] schools I'm not I'm not pushing what I
[56:47] want you see
[56:48] something the strength out of Zion is
[56:53] not schooling right amen I don't care if
[56:56] you can read your name in Box Car
[56:58] letters I don't care if you ever had an
[57:01] education in your life I don't care if
[57:03] you have a million dollar or you don't
[57:05] have a penny I don't care if you have
[57:07] schooling or none come on Church we're
[57:10] not talking about that we're talking
[57:12] about what Jesus done when he sent the
[57:15] Holy Ghost back in the church to give us
[57:17] strength amen amen the word the word
[57:21] must be fulfilled if you're going to
[57:23] preach the gospel the word proceedeth
[57:25] out of the mouth brother man said it had
[57:26] to be a thought before it was a
[57:28] word well you don't know what the word
[57:31] means till you see the manifestation of
[57:33] it and then you have the thought
[57:35] fulfilled
[57:37] word because you have manifested word
[57:40] see what it is it's the strength the
[57:43] strongness in Galatians chapter 3 Paul
[57:45] says he therefore that minister to you
[57:48] the spirit and worketh miracles among
[57:50] you doeth he by The Works of the law or
[57:53] by the hearing of Faith amen even as
[57:56] Abraham believed God it was counted unto
[57:58] him for righteousness know ye therefore
[58:00] that we which are our faith are the same
[58:02] of the children of Abraham this began at
[58:05] Jerusalem the very City that that was
[58:08] prophesied it began to be preached
[58:10] remittance of sin and began to preach
[58:12] out of there and there was a law came
[58:14] out of Zion now this law was a different
[58:18] law because it had a different
[58:20] priest it wasn't the same thing that
[58:22] Moses had been given it was a different
[58:24] kind of law amen I I I'll tell you it's
[58:27] powerful Isaiah 2:3 said for out of Zion
[58:29] shall come forth the law and the word of
[58:31] the Lord from Jerusalem where did the
[58:32] gospel
[58:34] start right there in
[58:36] Jerusalem and what kind of law went
[58:39] forth it is a law of Faith amen there is
[58:43] a law of faith that resides in the
[58:45] church watch brother randam tell us this
[58:47] he said the power that'll raise us up is
[58:49] in us right
[58:52] now we are now in the power of the
[58:56] Resurrection now if there wasn't a law
[58:59] to that Sons and Daughters of God could
[59:00] create a world and go live a private
[59:02] life on it you have the power in you to
[59:04] do it right now if you got to Shadow the
[59:06] power of God you got power to do it God
[59:07] is omnipotent see what I mean the power
[59:10] that is in you make you speak a world
[59:13] yeah it's already in you that's what
[59:16] power is in the church but it's
[59:18] controlled by
[59:19] law and that law is the law of
[59:25] faith which could be said is the law of
[59:29] Life Paul said look there's there's
[59:31] something works in my members it's the
[59:33] law of death right but I found another
[59:38] law thank God there's another
[59:41] law for one law was under condemnation
[59:46] but the other is UN the law of life in
[59:49] Deuteronomy brother man said it actually
[59:50] means two laws but one was a law of
[59:53] Mount SII and the other was a law of
[59:56] Mount Calvary one was a law that brought
[59:59] death and the other is a blw that
[1:00:01] brought life one is a law with
[1:00:03] conditions and the other is life without
[1:00:06] conditions it is the life of Jesus
[1:00:09] Christ it is a law that has gone out of
[1:00:12] the Holy Hill of God Amen to Amen to
[1:00:15] think about I almost can't keep my
[1:00:16] English language right now far there's
[1:00:18] something coming out of this church
[1:00:19] there something coming out of God's
[1:00:21] people it's a law that is exhibiting
[1:00:23] itself in the working of his mighty
[1:00:25] power power that is coming out of the
[1:00:27] Church of the Living God it is the law
[1:00:29] of the spirit God sets his laws into
[1:00:32] work
[1:00:34] sir now now you got to believe in the
[1:00:36] laws of God even atheist believes in
[1:00:39] them whether they want to attribute it
[1:00:40] to God or not they plant fields and they
[1:00:42] harvest their wheat and they operate in
[1:00:45] them laws whether they give that credit
[1:00:47] to God or not they got the law anyhow
[1:00:49] the denominational world has built their
[1:00:51] charismatic uh uh uh propagandas of
[1:00:55] prosperity and they use the law of God
[1:00:57] to get there they took the 10th the
[1:01:00] tithing the 10th uh uh and I don't want
[1:01:02] to say this wrong but honestly the the

[1:01:08] something we don't talk about but
[1:01:10] sometimes honestly it's robbing the

[1:01:58] man and the Seed of Abraham is a blessed
[1:02:01] seed come on

[1:03:00] took that to the negative too many times
[1:03:03] we thought well we do this and we're
[1:03:04] going to reap bad and we do this and
[1:03:05] we're going to reap bad but if that's
[1:03:07] true about the bad then why isn't it
[1:03:10] true about the good if you plant the

[1:03:52] right out of the Church of the Living
[1:03:54] God there's laws of death and life and
[1:03:56] thank God there's another law I've took
[1:03:58] too long to get to my point Amen in
[1:04:01] Psalms 110 watch this in the third P
[1:04:03] first and thy people shall be willing in
[1:04:08] the day of thy
[1:04:11] power now watch MDC prophesied to be
[1:04:15] sitting at the right hand I will not
[1:04:17] repent there forever now watch but now
[1:04:20] he's saying thy
[1:04:22] people the people of this great Prince
[1:04:26] the people of this great Messiah yeah
[1:04:29] will be willing in the day of his
[1:04:33] power now I think that's a that's a
[1:04:35] sermon within itself but I'll just say
[1:04:37] this to
[1:04:40] you
[1:04:41] God has a
[1:04:48] people now now brother Christopher when
[1:04:50] you read Elijah he got under a complex
[1:04:53] and you know what his complex was there
[1:04:55] there's nobody left but me
[1:04:58] right and today people under Elijah's
[1:05:01] Ministry sometimes gets the same
[1:05:06] complex nobody but us but let me tell
[1:05:09] you go ahead brother when he showed the
[1:05:12] Vindicated word up there on the
[1:05:14] mountain there was a scream when they
[1:05:16] saw the fire fell y'all remember it they
[1:05:18] saw the fire fell and there was a scream
[1:05:20] come out of the people and they said our
[1:05:22] God is God brother Bram said there was
[1:05:24] that 7,000
[1:05:26] that had never bowed their knee but
[1:05:29] isn't it amazing Elijah brother Ram said
[1:05:32] God broke open and showed him there was
[1:05:34] 7,000 names recorded that had never
[1:05:36] bowed their knees and it was in Elijah's
[1:05:38] Ministry in the last days when the Bible
[1:05:41] said there would be everybody worshiping
[1:05:43] the Beast except for those who had their
[1:05:46] names in the Lamb's Book of Life and it
[1:05:48] was under an Elijah's Ministry the book
[1:05:50] was broke open and showed there's more
[1:05:53] than just you brother random there's
[1:05:55] more than just just one man going to
[1:05:56] make this Rapture but there's 7,000
[1:05:59] that's never bowed their knee there are
[1:06:00] True Believers folks they're in Africa
[1:06:03] and India they're all over Ohio they're
[1:06:06] all over the Midwest and down in Arizona
[1:06:09] and across through Mexico there's a
[1:06:11] bride across this planet amen and God
[1:06:14] has a people this
[1:06:16] morning God has a people
[1:06:21] hallelujah I want to sing I'm one of
[1:06:23] them not I'm all of them right
[1:06:27] one of them some say I'm all of them if
[1:06:31] you don't come to my church you can't go
[1:06:33] I don't have that song Here we don't
[1:06:35] even know the words to that song we know
[1:06:38] the song Come here unto the Lord without
[1:06:40] money without price whoever can come let
[1:06:43] him come and drink of the Waters of Life
[1:06:45] freely there's something to have in the
[1:06:48] house of God there a reality of this
[1:06:50] message God has a people there's a
[1:06:53] people here this morning
[1:06:56] hall now this people that I'm talking
[1:06:59] about is talked about in The Book of
[1:07:00] Psalms we're talking about thousands of
[1:07:03] years ago your name was put there and
[1:07:06] said you would be willing in the day of
[1:07:08] his power yes
[1:07:11] sir people now isn't it amazing that
[1:07:15] Jesus specifically brings this up in
[1:07:18] John 17 and he said I have manifested my
[1:07:21] name unto them which
[1:07:23] thou gavest me out of the world thine
[1:07:28] they were and thou gavest them me and
[1:07:31] they have kept Thy word now brother Bram
[1:07:34] said them was love gifts from the father
[1:07:37] to
[1:07:38] Jesus and the Bible said no man can come
[1:07:42] unto me except my father draw him and I
[1:07:46] will in no wise cast him out if you can
[1:07:50] come he won't cast you out because only
[1:07:54] God's people people will be willing in
[1:07:57] the day of his power
[1:07:59] amen now it's it's amazing to me brother
[1:08:02] B said all that will come see the
[1:08:04] predestinated who did this God before
[1:08:07] the foundation of the world and if we
[1:08:09] come in an illegitimate birth through e
[1:08:11] corruption making us all her children
[1:08:12] and subject to death then the Sovereign
[1:08:15] God has to make a way to redeem this
[1:08:16] children and all the father hath given
[1:08:18] me will come to me and no man come to me
[1:08:20] unless my father draws him now watch
[1:08:23] this all the father hath given
[1:08:26] me in Titus he says watch in Titus chap
[1:08:31] 2:3 looking for that blessed hope in the
[1:08:33] appearing of our great savior God and
[1:08:35] our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself
[1:08:38] for
[1:08:39] us that he might redeem us from all
[1:08:44] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[1:08:47] peculiar people well we got that nail
[1:08:50] don't
[1:08:51] we oh yeah peculiar don't just mean odds
[1:08:54] y'all know that right right peculiar
[1:08:57] means in this example it means only
[1:09:00] found in a certain place all right panda
[1:09:04] bear is peculiar to China kangaroo is
[1:09:08] peculiar to Australia yeah you can
[1:09:11] transplant them but they're still
[1:09:14] peculiar yeah amen and you see that
[1:09:18] God's people are peculiar in that they
[1:09:21] belong to him and he gave himself see a
[1:09:25] r some for them amen and this is this is
[1:09:27] the point thy people now here Paul is
[1:09:30] going in the book of Acts and he's going
[1:09:32] down in Corinth and watch what he does
[1:09:34] in Acts chapter 18 and Paul's going in
[1:09:38] the Lord speaks to him and he says this
[1:09:39] he says for I am with thee and no man
[1:09:42] shall set on thee to hurt thee for I
[1:09:45] have much people in this city and you
[1:09:47] continue there a year and six months
[1:09:49] teaching the word of God among
[1:09:54] them I I have much people in this
[1:09:59] city and they are not yet
[1:10:03] converted these people have not been
[1:10:06] baptized they have not yet received the
[1:10:08] gospel but God says to Paul you stay in
[1:10:12] this city because I have many people
[1:10:15] here can you imagine amen here brother
[1:10:18] brandom is taking off to Chicago there's
[1:10:20] thousands gathering together and he
[1:10:22] reveals I'm going up there for one
[1:10:24] person
[1:10:26] because God had somebody up
[1:10:29] there that was his person before he ever
[1:10:33] sent the prophet there the Good
[1:10:35] Samaritan our lord Jesus went around the
[1:10:37] long way to go down to the well of
[1:10:40] Samaria because there was a need down
[1:10:42] there he had a person down there he has
[1:10:45] people down there and listen the Bible
[1:10:47] said that the Lord himself should
[1:10:49] descended from heaven in the last days
[1:10:51] because there is a
[1:10:53] people a people yes Lord Jesus of people
[1:10:56] that would be willing and I don't have
[1:10:58] time to finish it that would be willing
[1:10:59] in the day yeah amen of his
[1:11:04] power let me say something to you right
[1:11:06] now this this message is the greatest
[1:11:10] example of the power of God that has
[1:11:13] ever hit the face of the
[1:11:16] Earthen brother bam told us simply he
[1:11:20] has done more in my Ministry yes sir
[1:11:23] than he did in his own Ministry three
[1:11:25] and a half years when he was on the
[1:11:27] earth many times one meeting with
[1:11:30] brother brandom held more miracles than
[1:11:32] the whole book of Acts put
[1:11:35] together yes sir it was an
[1:11:38] omnipotent example of the power of God
[1:11:42] that was sent into this day and you know
[1:11:43] what brother brandom had to say about it
[1:11:46] I'm the greatest that ever
[1:11:49] lived come look at me follow me do for
[1:11:53] me come on brother
[1:11:55] he said well see I was only a
[1:11:59] voice I was just standing there
[1:12:02] yeah it wasn't what I the seventh angel
[1:12:06] did it's what I was willing to surrender
[1:12:11] my life
[1:12:12] too here is God exhibiting power because
[1:12:16] he's in power and here's a prophet on
[1:12:18] the earth saying Lord I'm willing to do
[1:12:21] it Hallelujah listen to me the power of
[1:12:24] God is here the power of faith is in
[1:12:27] this building he's looking for a willing
[1:12:29] heart he's looking for somebody and will
[1:12:31] say father not my will but thy will be
[1:12:34] done God if you want to use my hands to
[1:12:36] heal I'm here Lord if you want to use my
[1:12:39] mouth to speak I'm here Lord if you want
[1:12:42] to use my feet to walk I'm here Lord
[1:12:45] It's the power of God that has come into
[1:12:47] the
[1:12:49] church Hallelujah now look what brother
[1:12:52] Ram said he said see there in in and and
[1:12:54] look at beyond the Unseen brother BR
[1:12:56] comes in there and he says watch he said
[1:12:58] this is not William brandom speaking
[1:13:00] Yeah it's the Lord he surrendered his
[1:13:04] body to me yeah I'm the Lord William
[1:13:08] brandom was willing yeah he was willing
[1:13:12] to let his personal feelings go he was
[1:13:14] willing to let his insecurities go he
[1:13:17] was willing to let his complications go
[1:13:19] he was letting letting it go so God
[1:13:21] could use him I think about this often
[1:13:25] when he says is it pulsating to you I he
[1:13:28] surrendered his life to me and he says
[1:13:31] it is here amen amen that he is doing
[1:13:35] this now brother bam tells us something
[1:13:37] here he tells us clearly that this is
[1:13:41] the Lord Jesus working in his spiritual
[1:13:45] body because the person of the Lord
[1:13:48] Jesus is setting at the right hand and
[1:13:52] he will come again in power and great
[1:13:54] Glory and I'm not going to teach on that
[1:13:56] he's going to come in power and great
[1:13:58] Glory now God promises this that he has
[1:14:03] the same
[1:14:04] attitude he has the same
[1:14:07] power everything but the physical body
[1:14:12] right that is setting at the right hand
[1:14:16] but his spirit is in here to make
[1:14:18] manifest to take our lives to make it
[1:14:22] exactly what he was that's what he
[1:14:24] promised
[1:14:25] he is the same in every
[1:14:30] principle except for the Corporal
[1:14:33] body now thy P thy people yeah are
[1:14:38] willing in the day of
[1:14:43] power now he's
[1:14:45] there he's in heaven let me me let me
[1:14:48] just say what brother Bram says here he
[1:14:50] said the same one that Joshua met at
[1:14:52] those walls the Unseen one the invisible
[1:14:55] one the omnipotent
[1:14:57] one he says he's here just as
[1:15:00] real as when he was standing there
[1:15:03] against the walls of
[1:15:05] Jericho a figurative type of
[1:15:08] course melc met
[1:15:11] Abraham do you
[1:15:13] see mcedc comes back and Abraham says
[1:15:17] I've talked face to face with God he
[1:15:19] talked to
[1:15:21] mecdc he was the Unseen host and he's
[1:15:24] here just as real as he was there he's
[1:15:28] everywhere that his people are gathered
[1:15:32] together because it is his spiritual
[1:15:35] body praise the Lord now look if my
[1:15:40] spirit was my
[1:15:42] shadow if my spirit was my shadow y'all
[1:15:45] let's just say if you stand the light
[1:15:47] and you cast a shadow many Shadows up
[1:15:50] here but if you cast a light and and you
[1:15:52] cast a shadow brother B said the shadow
[1:15:55] that's cast is a type of the spirit of
[1:15:58] Jesus Christ amen so you have his person
[1:16:01] then you have his shadow which is his
[1:16:03] Spirit yeah he says the spirit
[1:16:06] now the body supernaturally now the body
[1:16:09] of the Lord Jesus is the shadow as it
[1:16:11] was of the natural physical body of the
[1:16:13] Lord if healings if power if Visions if
[1:16:19] these things Christ had in him has gone
[1:16:23] out of his shadow
[1:16:25] then Christ is
[1:16:28] paralyzed his natural body sits
[1:16:31] paralyzed because that if his physical
[1:16:34] body
[1:16:35] moves his shadow will move with
[1:16:39] it and if we are in Christ by the Holy
[1:16:42] Ghost
[1:16:44] baptism all the way the body of Christ
[1:16:46] moves it will move the same way on the
[1:16:50] earth for this is a shadow of his body
[1:16:55] now taking it out of these things of the
[1:16:58] world predestinated by God called of God
[1:17:00] elected chosen of God saved by God
[1:17:02] baptized in the body by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:05] and made members of his body we are
[1:17:08] alive we are ready yeah and we are
[1:17:11] willing
[1:17:13] yes amen we are
[1:17:16] alive we are
[1:17:18] ready we are willing stand to your feet
[1:17:22] with me
[1:17:23] today
[1:17:25] raise the
[1:17:37] Lord because he's
[1:17:43] there his spirit is
[1:17:46] here it's here in
[1:17:49] power isn't it amazing that he said
[1:17:52] there will come a
[1:17:53] day that in the evening
[1:17:57] time there shall be light yes
[1:18:00] sir and what brother Bram teaches is he
[1:18:03] says that power is here he said but the
[1:18:07] clouds of man's
[1:18:09] theology has blocked the
[1:18:13] church he said but if we could fan back
[1:18:15] them clouds of unbelief this morning
[1:18:18] Lord Jesus we would see him in the same
[1:18:21] resurrection
[1:18:23] power
[1:18:26] is that
[1:18:28] something now what was it that raised
[1:18:31] Jesus what was it that raised him out of
[1:18:34] that grave it was resurrection
[1:18:38] power and what was it that gave them
[1:18:41] disciples the Holy Ghost in
[1:18:43] Pentecost resurrection power and what
[1:18:47] was it that they
[1:18:49] preached in Corinth and Ephesians what
[1:18:52] was it they preached that raised the
[1:18:54] dead and healed the sick and converted
[1:18:56] the souls resurrection
[1:19:00] power but long after them
[1:19:03] disciples there become a long day a
[1:19:05] gloomy day a dismal day brother ram
[1:19:07] calls it and men's theologies begin to
[1:19:11] remove the resurrection power from the
[1:19:15] church right
[1:19:18] yeah but it's
[1:19:20] prophesied that in the end time yes what
[1:19:25] they used in the book of
[1:19:27] Acts would be resurrected
[1:19:30] again so it wouldn't just be the
[1:19:32] resurrection power it's a
[1:19:35] resurrected power
[1:19:38] amen now if you'd like to study the
[1:19:40] message go type that in resurrection
[1:19:43] power and then type in resurrected
[1:19:48] power and he's telling you the power
[1:19:51] that is in the church today is the same
[1:19:56] power that was in the Believers back
[1:19:58] there in the early church it's just God
[1:20:00] has resurrected that
[1:20:03] power and in the days of that
[1:20:08] power there will be a people who are
[1:20:11] willing yes
[1:20:12] amen amen they're willing they're
[1:20:16] willing to open their
[1:20:18] heart do you see it behold I stand to
[1:20:21] the door knock do you see Ephesians is
[1:20:23] talking about revelation
[1:20:25] yes sir behold I stand at the door and
[1:20:27] knock If any man would open What's the
[1:20:30] mystery brother Wayne the latch is on
[1:20:32] the
[1:20:33] inside and thy people will be
[1:20:37] willing they'll open amen
[1:20:42] amen it brings so much to real it brings
[1:20:44] so much real to me personally I'm
[1:20:47] reading the scriptures in Philippians
[1:20:48] says let this mind be in you y let
[1:20:53] it
[1:20:55] you mean you could be
[1:20:57] willing and you could open a door that
[1:21:00] the same power that was in them
[1:21:03] Apostles the same thing God was he still
[1:21:07] is yes sir amen and he's chose this day
[1:21:10] and he's chose this
[1:21:13] people and all I can say is I'm
