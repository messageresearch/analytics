[4:41] Amen. That's a Amen. A wonderful thing.
[4:45] Amen. And he said, "He that hunger and
[4:47] thirst after righteousness, they shall
[4:50] be filled." Amen. And when you make the
[4:53] prayer for him to come and fill your
[4:54] heart, he's already made a promise that
[4:56] he would do it. Amen. Amen. It's good to
[4:59] be in the house of the Lord tonight.
[5:00] Good to see everybody out on a Thursday
[5:02] evening. And uh we just want to tonight
[5:06] to go into the word of the Lord. You
[5:08] have a few things on my heart here, and
[5:11] I I just pray we'll be able to share
[5:12] them with you tonight. Uh we want to
[5:17] be we want to be sensitive to the
[5:20] Lord. Amen. And just before we u just
[5:24] before we read the scripture, maybe we
[5:26] just bow our hearts for a word of
[5:27] prayer. Father, we are certainly
[5:30] thankful tonight for what you have given
[5:32] us, the life that is in our lungs and
[5:35] that's in our life. Lord, that we just
[5:37] be able to, Lord, even the breath that's
[5:40] in our body belongs to
[5:42] you. Our minds, our beings, our hearts,
[5:46] Lord, we're bought with a price. And we
[5:49] ask you tonight that you would just use
[5:51] us, Lord, as you see fit, Father. That
[5:54] you'd just come into the room, that you
[5:56] would take your word, Lord. And father
[5:59] surely we have set aside time and we
[6:01] found Lord areas that was inspiring and
[6:05] things that would speak to the needs
[6:07] Lord
[6:08] but what would they be without you Lord?
[6:11] So we just ask this evening that just
[6:14] you would send the spirit of
[6:16] revelation into the midst of your
[6:18] people, Lord. That your word, Lord,
[6:20] would open to our hearts, knowing so
[6:23] many times your prophet told us that we
[6:25] could open the pages of the Bible, but
[6:28] we couldn't open the word, Lord. And
[6:30] we're asking you now that the author
[6:33] would take this word and it would open
[6:35] to the heart of your children. That the
[6:37] revelation would grant to them the
[6:39] desires of their lives, Lord. Filling
[6:41] them, Lord, encouraging them, Lord. Now,
[6:45] Father, as we bow our hearts to you in
[6:47] acknowledgment that we have no
[6:49] abilities, Lord, but we invite you to
[6:52] come to your word tonight, that you
[6:53] would use it, Lord, that you would speak
[6:55] to your children. And Father, that your
[6:58] great anointing would just lift us into
[7:00] another realm of revelation, Lord, and
[7:03] understanding that our hearts might be a
[7:05] flame with your power and your
[7:07] anointing, oh God. Now, Father, we
[7:09] humble ourselves to you, asking you to
[7:12] come in the midst of us, Lord. We ask it
[7:14] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[7:18] Amen. And amen. And God bless you
[7:21] tonight. If you have your Bibles, we
[7:23] would like to go into the word of the
[7:24] Lord and the book of Revelations, the
[7:26] sixth chapter. And I want to just read
[7:29] the first verse. Revelation chapter 6
[7:31] and verse 1. Revelation 6 and verse one.
[7:37] Amen. Just a little something here on
[7:39] our heart. I pray it'd be a blessing to
[7:41] you tonight.
[7:43] Revelation chapter 6 and verse
[7:45] one. And I saw when the lamb opened one
[7:51] of the
[7:52] seals, and I heard as it were the noise
[7:57] of a thunder, and one of the four beasts
[8:00] said, "Come and see." May the Lord bless
[8:03] his word tonight. As you can be
[8:05] seated, I'd like to speak to you for a
[8:08] few minutes tonight on this the subject
[8:10] of the opening of the word. The opening
[8:14] of the word. Now, some of the things
[8:16] that we have tonight are very common to
[8:19] some of you and to some of you maybe
[8:20] it's newer thing. Amen. But uh but as I
[8:24] as I approach this tonight, Amen. we'll
[8:26] we'll we'll speak it a little more like
[8:28] no one's ever heard it so that everybody
[8:31] can get it. Amen. And so, but as we as
[8:34] we're looking at this, it's I I think
[8:37] sometimes uh that it uh maybe would um
[8:40] maybe that it would be
[8:42] underestimated at what this really means
[8:44] to the church of the living God. What
[8:47] what the term in this hour of the
[8:50] meaning of the opening of the word, how
[8:53] powerful that it is to this generation.
[8:55] And it would be something that would be
[8:57] relevant to our age and to its time. Now
[9:00] when we read here and we say when the
[9:02] lamb had opened one of the seals. Now,
[9:04] this is a very powerful reality in the
[9:07] book of Revelations because, amen, this
[9:10] book that he just opened has been in the
[9:12] hands of God since the time that Adam
[9:16] had failed. And the book of redemption
[9:18] has went back into the hands of God and
[9:21] has stayed there until the time that the
[9:25] end time would come and the lamb would
[9:27] open the book, which would reveal the
[9:29] end time ministry. Amen. When we talk
[9:32] about this tonight, we're talking about
[9:33] introducing something to you. I know
[9:35] each of you have a seal book. How many's
[9:37] got a seal book? The book of the seven
[9:39] seals or Amen. The Revelation of the
[9:41] Seven Seals. Now, that's a book. Amen.
[9:43] That uh uh that I I I would have to say
[9:46] that it was it's a it's a it's a it's a
[9:48] landmark book. It's a it's a tremendous
[9:50] book. And and it has been something that
[9:53] the church has been looking for. Amen.
[9:56] For thousands of years. Amen. when you
[9:59] uh when you read your seal book, I don't
[10:01] know if you realize uh the realities of
[10:04] what has been done to put that what
[10:06] you're reading in your hands, how far it
[10:09] has come. It dates all the way back with
[10:12] John writing the book of Revelations and
[10:14] writing it in symbol form. But then as
[10:16] it is spoken in Daniel the 12th chapter,
[10:19] amen, Daniel was told to shut up that
[10:21] book and seal it. Amen. Until the time
[10:24] of the end. So this is an end time
[10:27] revelation. This is an end time message.
[10:30] It is the end time events. It is the end
[10:33] time. Everything about the opening of
[10:35] the word is the end time. Amen. You see
[10:38] when the prophet speaks of this, brother
[10:40] Bam then brings it in into his own
[10:43] ministry. And this is the part of this
[10:45] that has caused so many of the
[10:48] denominational uh uh uh believers in the
[10:51] world today to reject the ministry of
[10:53] William Brham. And it's because that he
[10:55] injected himself or rather revealed that
[10:58] he played a part in the opening of these
[11:01] things to this generation. Now, you can
[11:04] try to uh you can try to ignore William
[11:07] Brandham if you'd like to. Amen. But
[11:09] I'll say this, you will never have a
[11:11] rapture without the message of William
[11:14] Brandom. Amen. I'm sorry, but it it is
[11:16] more than just the coming of the Holy
[11:19] Ghost. It's more than just the pouring
[11:21] out of his spirit. This is the
[11:23] restoration of sunship that has been hid
[11:27] from the foundation of the world since
[11:29] Adam fell. There has never anybody stood
[11:32] in the in the place where you're
[11:34] standing. Amen. Except for our Lord
[11:36] Jesus Christ. Amen. When I think about
[11:39] this, I think of what God has done to
[11:41] this. Now, Brother Brandham himself in a
[11:43] message is titled, "Is this the sign of
[11:46] the inser?" How many's ever heard that
[11:48] sermon? Is this the sign of the inser?
[11:50] If you haven't heard it, I'm going to
[11:51] give you some homework. You go home and
[11:53] listen to this sermon. Is this the sign
[11:55] of the end? This is the sermon brother
[11:58] preaches in 12:30 uh uh of 1962. It's
[12:01] the last sermon of 1962. And he's just
[12:04] had a series of events that has happened
[12:06] in his life. And and he's trying to
[12:09] culminate these things. And he's asking
[12:11] questions to the church. And he's just
[12:14] about to leave uh Jeffersonville and
[12:16] head out west. And he's trying to make
[12:18] sure the people understand that he's not
[12:21] just doing this, but he's following the
[12:23] inspiration of God that's going to
[12:26] result in the unfolding of the great
[12:29] revelation of the seven seals which has
[12:31] been promised. Now, if you're listening
[12:33] to is this a sign of the end, sir? Amen.
[12:36] How many realizes brother gives six
[12:38] different dreams? He he interprets six
[12:41] different dreams in the front of the
[12:42] book. He'll go in and he'll begin to
[12:44] talk about dreams. Now I want you to
[12:46] watch a a something that he begins to
[12:48] insert from the time he starts preaching
[12:51] that sermon. He begins to inject the
[12:53] idea of going west.
[12:56] He begins to talk about the first time
[12:58] when he was injured in remember he went
[13:00] under the anesthesia. He said a couple
[13:02] months later I went under anesthesia
[13:04] again. He said there I was out in west
[13:06] with a golden cross. He said, "Then one
[13:08] day I met a a soussayer on the bus, and
[13:10] she began to tell me my birth and where
[13:13] I was born." And she began to say,
[13:14] "You'll never be successful in the east.
[13:17] Your consolation you were born at was
[13:19] all pointing to the west." And then,
[13:21] Brother Bam then goes on and begins to
[13:23] discuss how he felt a leading to go west
[13:25] and how the all these things begin to
[13:27] come west. Well, that six different
[13:29] dreams that he has, he has those six
[13:32] different dreams about being in the
[13:34] west. Every one of them is about him
[13:36] going west. And and so what he's dealing
[13:38] with is he's dealing with dreams that
[13:40] has all been given him from the people.
[13:42] He said, "But there is one vision with
[13:44] these dreams that has told me that it's
[13:47] time to go west." Now, if you're looking
[13:49] at it there uh in signs of the sers, I
[13:52] played it for you. If you were here in
[13:54] the pre-ervice, you've heard the vision
[13:56] that brother has. And it's actually the
[13:58] sign to him that the time to go west had
[14:01] came. Now remember when he does this,
[14:04] brother man says, "I come home and I
[14:05] seen some rocks piled up and he said,
[14:07] "Then I went in a room, begin to pray
[14:09] and remember he said there was a bush
[14:11] standing in front of me and he said all
[14:13] of a sudden he said I seen some birds
[14:15] come and land on it, some kind of
[14:16] smaller birds." He said, "Then they all
[14:18] left and then another birds came and
[14:20] they all left." He said, "But then all
[14:22] of a sudden," he said, "We back in
[14:24] eternity, I seen the angels break and
[14:26] here they come." He said, "Dots like
[14:28] five maybe." He said, "No more than
[14:30] seven, no less than five." And he said,
[14:32] "Here they come all the way from
[14:34] eternity." And as they're coming, he
[14:36] said, "They took me out of the room,
[14:37] lifted me up within themselves." And he
[14:39] said, "There it was." He said, "Being
[14:41] packed away into those those angels."
[14:44] And and he discusses this. And he says,
[14:46] "Now what this is dealing with is he's
[14:48] dealing with them first angels are the
[14:50] first pull of my ministry. And them
[14:52] second bunch of birds that came." He
[14:54] said, "That's dealing with the second
[14:56] pull of my ministry." He said, "But when
[14:58] them angels come from eternity, it's
[15:01] speaking of that third pool." First was
[15:04] birds, second was birds, but the third
[15:07] was angels. Amen. Now, don't ever forget
[15:10] that the third is angels. And and that's
[15:13] where a lot of times when you hear
[15:15] people talking about how that the cloud
[15:17] appeared out at at sunset there and you
[15:20] hear them talking about it and and some
[15:22] people say, "Well, it didn't mean very
[15:23] much and it wasn't this." But don't
[15:25] never forget that that cloud that was
[15:27] around the face of our Lord Jesus was
[15:29] angels.
[15:31] And he said the third is angels. Amen.
[15:34] Now he's dealing with his own ministry.
[15:36] And this is the part that has really
[15:38] been tough on the Pentecostal world is
[15:41] because see when brother Brandon begin
[15:42] to have these he begins to show that it
[15:45] is a prophetic message that is supposed
[15:47] to come in the end time. and he's been
[15:50] praying for the sick and he's been
[15:51] prophesying and and things wonderful
[15:54] things has been happening. But he's not
[15:56] really started preaching doctrine at
[15:58] that time. But when he begins to talk
[16:00] about the third pool, he begins to say
[16:02] that those angels coming to me is about
[16:05] the doctrine that's going to rapture the
[16:07] church. Now, I hear people say all the
[16:09] time, you know, they get under
[16:10] inspiration say, "Well, doctrine don't
[16:12] matter." That's a lie out of the pits of
[16:15] hell. Amen. The very subject of this
[16:17] message is to restore the true doctrine
[16:20] back in the church of God. You can't
[16:23] have apostolic power without apostolic
[16:25] doctrine. Amen. We are not just a bunch
[16:28] of loose amen beheaded church that has
[16:32] no direction or no doctrine. But
[16:34] doctrine is the backbone of the church
[16:36] of the living God. And and we can be
[16:38] nice about it. We don't have to fight
[16:39] about doctrine. But most certainly,
[16:42] doctrine is very important because
[16:44] doctrine is the thing that's going to
[16:46] carry this church out in the rapture.
[16:48] Amen. It's what separates you. Amen.
[16:50] It's what separates you from the Baptist
[16:52] and from the Lutheran and from the
[16:54] Pentecostals. You say, "Well, I don't
[16:56] want to be separate." I do because
[16:58] they're going to go through a
[16:59] tribulation and I don't want to go
[17:01] through the tribulation. I'm glad God
[17:03] gave us doctrine that would set us apart
[17:06] from the shock that is in the ages that
[17:09] we're living in. Now, the prophet begins
[17:12] to tell us in the message of the seven
[17:13] seal, he talks about the vision of
[17:15] Junior Jackson. You all heard of the the
[17:18] dream of Junior Jackson. It happened in
[17:20] uh February of 1961. I thought that was
[17:22] pretty good. In February 1961, the the
[17:25] the dream Junior had. Remember what
[17:27] happened is Junior had a dream and
[17:29] brother Bam said the water come washing
[17:31] down on the mountain and you know the
[17:32] waters it washed it washed the place and
[17:34] he said and there was some stuff written
[17:36] and he said and I he said then brother
[17:38] Bham appears and he takes a sharp object
[17:40] and knocks the top of the mountain off
[17:42] basically and opens it up and light
[17:44] begins to shine on this granite and he
[17:47] said there were things written there he
[17:49] said that had never light shone on
[17:51] before. Right. Now, some people make it
[17:54] sound like that the seals were opened
[17:56] and then resealed up through the church
[17:58] ages, but according to brother Brandham,
[18:00] these things had not been talked about
[18:02] since the beginning. See, there were
[18:04] things that were written there that had
[18:05] nobody knew about there that wasn't
[18:07] coming and yet into Revelation. Now, I
[18:11] say that because you see when they when
[18:13] when the prophet begins to talk about
[18:14] this with with Junior Jackson, if y'all
[18:17] remember, Brother Bam said he didn't
[18:18] interpret it to him. He said, "Y'all
[18:20] look on this." And he said, "I'll," he
[18:23] said, 'In a minute, Junior said, he
[18:24] looked around. Brother Bram was gone.
[18:26] And he said he had slipped out west.
[18:28] Now, now, Brother Bam said, 'Now, that's
[18:30] being fulfilled right here tonight.
[18:32] Right. Now, what that is is when brother
[18:34] Brandham saw that with Junior Jackson,
[18:36] he told the people in the sermon, "Amen.
[18:39] Is this the sign of the end, he told
[18:42] them about the ideas he was having, but
[18:45] he never interpreted it to them, but he
[18:48] asked them a question and then asked
[18:50] them to stay in Jeffersonville and look
[18:54] on this." And then, Brother Bam goes
[18:56] west to meet with those angels to come
[18:59] back to interpret to them. And the way
[19:01] he says it then is the unwritten word.
[19:03] Now later he straightens it and said,
[19:05] "No, it's not unwritten. It was written,
[19:07] but it just had not been yet revealed."
[19:10] Amen. It was hid. It was written, but
[19:12] hid within the revelation of it. Now,
[19:15] Brother Bam says, "Now, that's what it
[19:17] is." See, and remember, if you get that
[19:19] tape, what time is it, sir? Well, that's
[19:21] exactly what you're seeing now. So, when
[19:23] he comes back and preaches the seven
[19:25] seal, he says, "This is the fulfillment
[19:28] of what time is it sir?" when I told you
[19:31] I was going west and I'm coming back now
[19:33] I'm going to fulfill that tonight and he
[19:35] begins to preach it now he tells us amen
[19:38] about those angels coming to him and
[19:40] he's got a lot of questions when those
[19:42] angels come in the room I guess we would
[19:43] too amen and he said there was a there
[19:46] was a big blast that happened and he
[19:48] said then that's what I was wondering is
[19:50] does this mean my death how many has
[19:52] caught that part of the angels coming to
[19:55] him I played the tape for you there and
[19:57] he said it was a great blast and he said
[19:59] I wondered what that meant. What does
[20:01] those five or seven angels mean coming
[20:04] to me? What does that mean? What does
[20:06] that blast mean? And brother Bram said,
[20:08] "Then what I did then was I just begin
[20:11] to pray." And I said, "Lord, if it means
[20:13] my death, let an anointing come." And he
[20:15] said, "Nothing happened." He said, "But
[20:17] now if it means a furthering of my
[20:19] ministry," he said, "And he said, the
[20:21] anointing struck the room and almost
[20:23] took me away." He said later about a
[20:25] half hour I come to myself reading
[20:27] Romans the 10th chapter of the end of
[20:29] the ninth chapter. Behold I lay in Zion
[20:32] a stone. Right? I'd lay in Zion a stone.
[20:35] How many knows that's the prophecy
[20:38] concerning the end time church in
[20:40] Zerubbabel in Zechariah 4 is he would
[20:43] bring forth the stone. Now it wouldn't
[20:45] be the cornerstone because the corner
[20:47] has now become the headstone. Amen. So
[20:50] William Brandham would be bringing the
[20:52] headstone revelation of the word, amen,
[20:55] back to the church. And brother Bam
[20:56] said, "What does that blast mean?" Now
[20:58] he has this on his heart. Now this is a
[21:00] and I guess it would be for all of us.
[21:02] It was a great struggle to him of these
[21:04] angels coming and he is not
[21:06] understanding this. So this is on his
[21:08] heart when he goes out west and he goes
[21:11] up there. Now, how many's ever been in
[21:12] Sabino Canyon? Yeah, you actually been
[21:15] in the canyon. Boy, a lot of you's been
[21:16] there. Amen. And if you haven't, we we
[21:19] need to do that sometime. Hey, I don't
[21:21] know how we'd get that done, but it'd be
[21:22] wonderful. Amen. But but it would be
[21:24] wonderful for everybody to see this.
[21:27] Amen. But but when you go back up in
[21:29] there, it's it's just rugged. That's all
[21:31] you can say about it. Just rugged. Amen.
[21:33] And and and brother Bam goes back up in
[21:35] there and he's praying and asking the
[21:37] Lord and he went in to a certain spot
[21:39] and knelt down. They believe they found
[21:41] that very spot and it's pretty neat
[21:42] little place. Amen. But he knelt down
[21:44] there and be to pray and he was asking
[21:47] the Lord, "What does this mean?" And he
[21:49] says, "See now watching the breach."
[21:51] He'll tell you about it. He'll say, "And
[21:53] there I was standing and something
[21:55] happened." And he said, "All of a
[21:57] sudden, something fell in my hand." Now,
[21:59] can you imagine? You're praying. You've
[22:01] had this amazing vision and you've got
[22:03] all these dreams and you're saying,
[22:05] "God, what does it mean? What does it
[22:07] mean? What does it mean?" And you're
[22:08] praying and all of a sudden something
[22:10] hits your hands. Isaac, wouldn't it be
[22:11] something? something strikes your hands
[22:14] and when you look down, you're holding a
[22:16] sword.
[22:18] Now, this ministry of Brother is not
[22:20] just a common ministry.
[22:23] I know sometimes guys had maybe a dream
[22:25] or they kind of have a vision or
[22:27] something. They think they're a prophet.
[22:29] Not like this.
[22:33] We're talking about something all
[22:35] together different. How many knows the
[22:37] Bible says that in Revelations the
[22:39] testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[22:41] of prophecy.
[22:43] So it's the spirit of prophecy. So you
[22:45] see in the end time you'll have
[22:46] ministers that are
[22:48] actually minor prophets that'll be among
[22:51] the bride church. But a prophet, a
[22:53] vindicated prophet is born a prophet.
[22:56] He's not just like a that he becomes a
[22:59] prophet after he gets the Holy Ghost,
[23:00] but he sees visions even before he's
[23:03] saved. Amen. because he's a vindicated
[23:06] prophet. The word is going to come out
[23:08] of him. Now watch here. Brother Bam is
[23:10] praying like this and something struck
[23:12] his hand and he said, "When I looked, it
[23:14] was a sword and the handle was made of
[23:17] pearl." Listen at him explain it. And it
[23:19] was the prettiest pearl you ever seen.
[23:21] And then he goes on to say, "Amen, that
[23:24] it was had a had a dueling uh guard
[23:26] there that was gold and a saber's blade.
[23:29] It wasn't too long, razor sharp,
[23:30] glistening silver." Now when you hear
[23:32] brother Bam explain this pearl amen
[23:35] precious precious stones and gold and
[23:37] servil it sounds a lot like what Paul
[23:40] teaches in the scripture when he said
[23:42] don't never build on hay wood and
[23:44] stubble but then he describes the
[23:46] preciousness of the word of God and that
[23:49] is what you're going to build on. Isn't
[23:51] it amazing that the thing that come into
[23:54] brother Brandham's hand was a precious
[23:55] thing. Amen. What what struck his hand
[23:58] was a precious thing. Amen. Something
[24:00] designed. Amen. To be precious in the
[24:03] hand of a believer. And when it struck
[24:05] his hand, Brother Bam said then he said,
[24:06] "While I was holding that," he says, and
[24:09] he says, "I looked at it." And he says,
[24:11] "Oh, you know, it always afraid of a
[24:13] sword and I was kind of glad I didn't
[24:15] live in them days." But he said, "Look,"
[24:17] he says, "All of a sudden, while I was
[24:18] holding it in my hand, a voice from
[24:20] somewhere said, "That is the king's
[24:22] sword.
[24:24] That is the king's sword." And then it
[24:25] left me. And he said, "Well, I wondered
[24:28] the king's sword." And I thought I if it
[24:30] would have said a king sword, it might
[24:32] have been that I would have understood
[24:34] it. He said the king sword. So I may not
[24:36] have this right, but I thought there's
[24:38] only one the king
[24:40] and that's God. And his sword is sharper
[24:44] than any two-edged sword. It's the word
[24:46] of God. Right now, he's telling us this
[24:49] in the breach, but look how he look how
[24:51] he hides a certain portion of what that
[24:55] means. He tells you about the angels
[24:57] coming. He says, "I'm praying for the
[24:59] meaning." And then a sword comes into my
[25:01] hand. But in the seventh seal, in the
[25:04] original seventh seal, he gives us
[25:06] another portion. And he says, "Listen,
[25:08] the end of the sermon on the seven
[25:10] seals." He comes to the seventh seal. He
[25:11] said, "What a day we're living in. What
[25:13] a great thing. What a mystery. What a
[25:15] secret." Standing there and when this
[25:17] left me, something come to me and said,
[25:19] "Don't fear. I don't hear no voice, but
[25:22] like on the inside said to me, I tell
[25:24] you the truth, something hit me and
[25:27] said, "Don't you fear. This is that
[25:30] third pull." Amen. His voice come back
[25:33] and said, "It's not a king's sword. It
[25:36] is the king's sword. It's the word of
[25:40] the Lord." Amen. And watch the
[25:41] attraction. Brother Bam said, "The word
[25:43] of the Lord, fear not. It is the third
[25:45] pull. It is the vindication of your
[25:48] ministry." Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[25:52] Think about that. He begins then to add
[25:54] in the seventh seal. He adds not what
[25:57] he's spoken to preach because he's still
[25:59] hiding. Now, here's the thing he's
[26:01] hiding. He's hiding that the third pull
[26:03] of his ministry is the seventh seal of
[26:07] the Bible. Amen. At this time, nobody's
[26:11] got a clue what the seventh seal means
[26:13] because the Bible said when the seal
[26:15] opened, there was silence for the space
[26:17] of a half an hour. There's no symbols
[26:19] there. There's nothing but a silence
[26:21] there. And brother Brandham, Amen, is
[26:23] trying to tell the church in the breach
[26:26] that it was his job to receive the word
[26:28] for the church. But when it come to the
[26:30] seventh seal, what does he do? He comes
[26:32] and then tells us that the sword in his
[26:35] hand Yeah. is the third pull.
[26:41] Now that sword in his hand was those
[26:43] seven angels coming to him. Now what
[26:46] does this mean? It means he was more
[26:49] than just praying for the sick. He was
[26:51] to do more than just prophesy over the
[26:54] people. He was to take this Bible that
[26:58] men have longed to look at and he was to
[27:01] open the revelations of this scripture
[27:04] in such a simple manner that even a dumb
[27:07] Arkansas hillbilly would follow after
[27:10] him 50 years later and be able to preach
[27:12] the uncarchable riches of Christ from
[27:15] the Garden of Eden all the way to the
[27:17] New Jerusalem because God has sent a
[27:20] prophet among us. Listen, there is
[27:22] nothing more powerful that ever happened
[27:24] in our life. There is nothing greater
[27:26] that has ever happened to you in your
[27:29] life than God opening this word and
[27:32] giving you a heart to believe it. It's a
[27:34] sword in your hand. It's grace in your
[27:37] life. It's a doctrine truth in your
[27:39] ability. It is the lifting power of the
[27:42] bride of Jesus Christ. There is only one
[27:45] king and that sword is his word and it
[27:48] was coming into the hand of a prophet.
[27:50] In this is the third pull. He explains
[27:53] it. Don't fear it. It is the third pull.
[27:56] Now, we'll get into this maybe a little
[27:58] bit later deeper, but how many of you
[28:00] read the seven seal
[28:02] book? Now, if you read the book and and
[28:04] if you take time and you want to go to
[28:06] the book, you'll find out that there's a
[28:08] place here. Brother Bam discusses
[28:10] Israel. And then he comes down to talk
[28:12] about the seal and he he just starts
[28:15] explaining a little bit and he says,
[28:17] "Now, I've got it written right here.
[28:20] Stop and go no further."
[28:23] But he don't
[28:25] stop. He goes on to explain that this
[28:28] sword in his hand is the third pull. He
[28:32] goes on to tell that those seven angels
[28:35] coming to him is the fulfillment of that
[28:37] vision he had under the tent and what it
[28:40] was going to be and how it was going to
[28:42] be. And he tells every bit of this. But
[28:44] now, if you wasn't setting in that
[28:46] service in
[28:47] 1963, you didn't know that.
[28:51] Now, back in our state, back in
[28:53] Arkansas, when I was a young guy growing
[28:54] up, man, it was the biggest contention
[28:57] in the world was that seven seal opened.
[29:00] Man, they was rough on that. They didn't
[29:01] think it was opened at all. Now, I'll
[29:03] tell you why. Because they got just that
[29:05] first portion when it come out in 1963.
[29:09] And they didn't go on and study the rest
[29:10] of it because some of them was living
[29:12] when that tape come out. And if you had
[29:14] that original tape, you can go you can
[29:16] go hear it. Brother Brandham cuts it off
[29:18] and on Monday he retaped something and
[29:20] go find out what he hides. What he hides
[29:23] is he hides that his ministry is the
[29:26] first portion of the seven seal. He
[29:29] hides it. And he says, "He told me not
[29:31] to tell you. We're going to omit it to
[29:34] the public." So the tape that went out
[29:37] was an omission of the seven seal. He
[29:40] didn't send out the revelation. How many
[29:42] knows why he didn't? Because the angel
[29:45] told him on the third pull, "Don't tell
[29:47] them what it is." Right? He said, "I'll
[29:50] take the revelation with me to my
[29:51] grave." And he did.
[29:55] That's why that so many come behind him
[29:58] and thought that he was going to bring a
[30:00] tent and he was going to open the seven
[30:02] seals and there it's why there was a
[30:04] great big division and return ministry
[30:05] and everybody wanting to play the tapes
[30:07] and amen. It's because they got hung up
[30:10] in that area because brother Brandham
[30:12] omitted the revelation on Monday morning
[30:15] but on that Sunday night he preached the
[30:18] revelation. Amen. And then in 1966 after
[30:22] his death, they restored the original
[30:24] seventh seal. So when you listen to it
[30:27] now, it's like he never stopped. He
[30:29] said, "I got stopped written right
[30:31] here." But we just keep listening. And
[30:33] then he begins to explain what the seven
[30:35] seal is. And he begins to describe the
[30:37] three folds of it. And he starts
[30:39] talking. Now, I'll just say this for
[30:41] your sake. If you're listening to it
[30:43] like I was, I was listening to it. And I
[30:45] knew the seven seal was open, but when I
[30:47] listened to it, Brother Bram comes
[30:48] through and he goes, "I'm going to tell
[30:49] you what my revelation of it is." And
[30:51] when he gets to that point, he just
[30:52] starts talking about
[30:54] himself. He just starts talking about uh
[30:56] Sabino Canyon, swords coming, angels.
[30:59] Amen. And I think I rewound that JP a
[31:01] hundred times cuz he said, "I'm going to
[31:04] tell you what the revelation of it is."
[31:06] And he just starts talking about his
[31:08] events in Sabino and the and the sunset
[31:11] and the cloud come. And after a while,
[31:15] After a while, it struck me, oh wait a
[31:18] minute, the first portion of the seventh
[31:21] seal is the word coming to a prophet. I
[31:26] said, oh my goodness, wait till I get a
[31:29] mic. Wait till I get a congregation.
[31:32] Wait till I get a crowd. And then I run
[31:34] out and started preaching it and they
[31:36] got mad at
[31:38] me. Amen. But you see, I found the
[31:41] revelation of it was real. Amen. And if
[31:43] you take time to study it, you'll agree
[31:46] with me that the message of William
[31:49] Brandham is the first portion of the
[31:51] coming of the Lord. Amen. And this is
[31:54] the part that will catch you up into the
[31:56] change of our body. That's why without
[31:59] it, you'll go into tribulation. Without
[32:01] it, you can never have a rapture. Don't
[32:03] you let anybody talk you out of it.
[32:06] Amen. You see what it is? It come back.
[32:08] This is the king's sword. And brother
[32:09] Bam says again, try and do God a
[32:11] service. It's the word. It's been placed
[32:13] in your hand. Don't fear it. It's your
[32:17] ministry.
[32:19] May I say it to you, church? Don't fear
[32:21] it. Amen. It's your rapture. Don't fear
[32:24] it. It's your deliverance. Don't fear
[32:26] it. It's your revival. Don't fear it.
[32:29] It's your ministry.
[32:32] Oh yeah. I got nothing to do with that
[32:34] first pull.
[32:36] I got nothing to do with that second
[32:38] pull. The bride don't have a first and
[32:41] second pool. But she does have a part of
[32:43] that third pull because we are part of
[32:46] it by predestination. The very word that
[32:49] is opened is now living inside these
[32:53] believers, which is the second part of
[32:56] the seven seal. Come on, church. Amen.
[32:58] That's why the devil's trying to talk
[33:00] about brother Brandham all the time and
[33:01] get you wondering whether it was true or
[33:03] not. He's trying to get you to focus on
[33:05] the first part so you miss the second
[33:07] part. But the first part's already over.
[33:10] That is what it is. What I'm wondering
[33:12] is, have you caught the revelation that
[33:14] you got a part in the seventh seal? And
[33:17] the opening of the word has opened the
[33:19] mystery of your life. This is why you
[33:22] were born. This is why you are who you
[33:24] are. This is why you feel the way you
[33:26] feel. You think the way you think. You
[33:28] act the way you act. Because there's a
[33:30] predestinated call over your life. The
[33:33] sovereign God has chose you and anointed
[33:36] you. Amen. This is the mystery of your
[33:39] life revealed. It's why you're here on
[33:43] the earth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah to
[33:46] God. I could take a shout and fit right
[33:48] now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[33:52] My this word has been placed in your
[33:54] hand. Amen. Anointing ones of the end
[33:57] time. If you like brother Bam's uh
[33:59] sermons 262 paragraph, brother Bam will
[34:01] say the third pull is the opening of the
[34:04] word. Now, that's where I'm taking my
[34:06] title tonight from. The third pull is
[34:09] the opening of the word. Yes, sir. The
[34:12] mysteries revealed. Now, there is no
[34:14] more higher order. Say it. A higher
[34:16] order. Higher order to reveal the word
[34:18] than a prophet. Amen. In other words,
[34:21] there's no school is higher than this
[34:24] prophet. There's no educators higher
[34:28] than this prophet. There's no
[34:29] theologians higher than this prophet.
[34:32] Because a prophet is a mute. It's not
[34:35] his own thinking. It's not his own idea.
[34:38] He will tell you, "I had an idea on the
[34:40] white horse rider and I thought it would
[34:43] be like this." He said, "But I was 180
[34:45] degrees wrong."
[34:48] You all know he he admitted it himself.
[34:52] That's right. He said, "I was I was
[34:55] wrong on it, but he corrected me and
[34:58] brought me out here, and I was 180
[35:00] degrees off." Yes. I've often uh Brother
[35:02] Chris, I've often taught about that how
[35:04] that brother Bram got in that hurricane,
[35:06] you know, or in the mountains up there
[35:08] and got turned around and confused and
[35:10] he said I was headed and I thought I was
[35:12] going to walk towards home and he said
[35:14] when God made the hole come in the
[35:16] cloud. You remember that? He's looking
[35:18] for the looking for the wire and he's
[35:20] all confused and fogs everywhere and he
[35:22] said hurricane mountain was six miles
[35:24] over there. Think about it, church. six
[35:27] church agents over there and it's been
[35:30] foggy that far through there. He said,
[35:33] "But all a sudden a hole opened up." And
[35:35] he said, "I was headed toward Canada. I
[35:38] was going the wrong way, but I looked
[35:40] through that hole and found the right
[35:41] direction." I tell you this. Amen. Amen.
[35:44] God put a hole. Amen. He He took us all
[35:47] the way back to the original teachings
[35:51] so the church would have true direction.
[35:54] Now, this third pull is the open word.
[35:55] It's mysteries revealed. No more higher
[35:57] order to reveal the word than a prophet.
[35:59] Amen. But the only way a prophet can be
[36:01] vindicated is by the word. And remember
[36:03] the third pull was the opening of them
[36:05] seven seals. Amen. To reveal the hidden
[36:09] truth that's been sealed in the word.
[36:12] Amen. Now I love it. Brother Bram says,
[36:14] "Now don't try to explain that. It's the
[36:16] third pull. I'll meet you in there."
[36:19] Amen. Now in the seventh seal, Brother
[36:21] Bram says, he says, "Now watch this." He
[36:24] says, "I was standing there and I had
[36:26] this little baby shoe in my hand and you
[36:28] make your first pull." He said, "And the
[36:30] fish will run after the lure. So you
[36:32] make your second pull because then it's
[36:34] only smaller fish." He said, "But then
[36:35] that third pull get it." Now he's
[36:38] talking about his own ministry. Taking
[36:40] them by the hand will get
[36:42] some. Prophesying, discerning their
[36:45] hearts will get some. But that third
[36:47] pull,
[36:49] it'll do the trick. And what does that
[36:52] mean? It means some of us would have
[36:54] went after the hand. We some of us would
[36:57] enjoy the second pull. But all of us was
[37:00] caught by the opening of the word.
[37:03] That's right. You see what he's telling
[37:05] you is the very thing that caused him to
[37:08] be rejected in the Pentecostals.
[37:11] Was the very attraction you had to it.
[37:15] The very reason you like this message is
[37:18] the very reason they rejected it. Yes,
[37:20] sir. Right. That's the truth. Some
[37:22] people love it and some hate it for the
[37:24] same reason. That's good. Yes, sir.
[37:27] Amen. You see that third pull will get
[37:30] it. And brother Bram said, you see,
[37:32] that's the thing. I always got messed up
[37:33] with preachers. He said, you know, I
[37:35] tried to explain it. And he goes on and
[37:36] talks about it. And he says, you
[37:38] remember, he said he got himself all
[37:39] tangled up. Remember that? And he said
[37:42] he got tangled up trying to explain it
[37:45] to ministers. Yeah. And he says,
[37:47] "Remember the angel said to him now, he
[37:50] was standing there with a little baby
[37:52] shoe and this big cord and he's trying
[37:54] to put it in that hole. And the angel
[37:57] scolded him and said, "You can't teach
[37:59] Pentecostal babies supernatural things."
[38:04] He was trying to let them know God has
[38:07] sent me. And he was excited about it as
[38:10] I am. Brother Bam, can you imagine? He's
[38:12] wondering about these things and all of
[38:13] a sudden God walks in, starts telling
[38:15] him what it means and how it goes and he
[38:17] runs out and says, "Hey y'all." Amen. I
[38:19] met the angel and he told me this and
[38:21] this and this and well I tell you, I
[38:23] went down to school down there and they
[38:25] taught me different than that.
[38:30] Now, how could he teach them?
[38:35] You see, he was telling they they'd say
[38:37] it. They'd say it, you know, hey, we we
[38:38] have revival meetings. Everybody's
[38:40] shouting and hey man, they're having a
[38:42] good time. What do we need with you?
[38:46] But he was trying to explain to them
[38:51] what it was that would capture the
[38:53] church for the bride. Now that third
[38:55] pull of course would be the thing that
[38:58] would attract the bride. Brother Bam
[39:00] says it's the place he said he'll meet
[39:02] me in there. He said there that third
[39:04] pole is and you won't tell nobody. And
[39:07] in Sabino Canyon, he said, "This is that
[39:11] third
[39:12] pull." Now, I say this, Brother
[39:14] Brandham. Amen. When he seen them
[39:16] coming, he says, "What is it? It's my
[39:18] new commission." Now, how many's ever
[39:20] heard the second climax vision or
[39:23] studied the second climactic vision? Can
[39:25] I see your hands? So, I know how many
[39:27] knows. Okay, there's just very few.
[39:29] Amen. It's in the sermon blasphemous
[39:32] names. It's in 62104.
[39:36] blasphemous names. And brother Bandham
[39:38] has a vision. Then when I start talking
[39:39] about it, you'll probably remember some
[39:40] of it. But he has a vision that he's on
[39:42] a platform out in in the woods and the
[39:45] sun's shining through and he's preaching
[39:47] and there's a lot of people. But he
[39:49] said, "I had two climaxes to make and
[39:50] some of them started getting tired and
[39:52] they started leaving."
[39:54] He said, "But I had another climax." And
[39:57] he said, "When I said they'll be back
[40:00] when the evening shadows fall, y'all
[40:02] remember that now?" Amen. They'll be
[40:04] back when the evening shadows fall. So,
[40:06] brother Bham knew there was another
[40:07] climax coming to his message. And when
[40:10] those angels were coming, he says,
[40:13] "They're coming with my commission.
[40:17] They're coming with my new orders.
[40:18] They're coming with my climax of my
[40:21] ministry." See, the third pull was not a
[40:24] downward way. It was the climax of his
[40:28] ministry. It was coming to that. Brother
[40:30] Bandham says, "It's coming with my
[40:32] message. It's the second climax. It is
[40:35] the new commission. Brother Brham says
[40:36] it and serves as this a sign that is the
[40:39] angels of the Lord coming to give me my
[40:42] new commission.
[40:44] He says this. See now when he sees this
[40:46] vision when I played for you, how many
[40:48] remembers I just played it here when
[40:50] those angels came to him. Now he said
[40:53] when I prayed about that he said Lord I
[40:56] want to see the interpretation of that v
[40:58] vision. And brother Bam said, "No
[41:00] interpretation ever came." Right? Now,
[41:04] think about that. He had this great
[41:05] vision of all this happening, these
[41:08] birds and then these angels and that
[41:09] great blast and him getting caught up in
[41:11] there. And he can't interpret the vision
[41:14] to the people. How many knows
[41:17] why? Because it's already written in the
[41:21] Bible.
[41:22] He said, "See, watch this. This vision
[41:25] was already written in the Bible." Now,
[41:27] let's read the vision. Revelation
[41:29] chapter 10 verse one.
[41:32] The vision that he has in his living
[41:34] room about those
[41:37] angels is the very vision that was
[41:40] written that John saw Yeah. in
[41:42] Revelations chapter 10. Amen. And I saw
[41:45] another mighty angel come down from
[41:47] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[41:50] rainbow was upon his head as a face were
[41:52] as the sun as his feet as the pillars of
[41:53] fire. And he had in his hand a little
[41:55] book open. And he set his right foot
[41:58] upon the sea and his left foot upon the
[42:00] earth. And he cried with a loud voices
[42:02] when a lion roarth. And he had heard
[42:04] seven thunders uttered the voices.
[42:06] Remember brother Bam kept talking about
[42:07] that loud clap of thunder. Amen. Now
[42:10] watch this. And the angel which I said
[42:12] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[42:14] earth lifted up his hands unto heaven
[42:15] and swore to him that liveth forever and
[42:17] ever who created heaven and the things
[42:19] are in earth and things are in and the
[42:21] sea and things that are in. And there
[42:23] should be time no longer. Now, if you're
[42:26] a studyer, you know that's not time on
[42:29] the clock.
[42:30] It's actually written no more delay.
[42:34] In other words, that the time is no
[42:36] more. Now, if you want to get a little
[42:38] deeper, that means denominational ages
[42:40] have just ran out. Amen. Now, what
[42:43] happens is he's declaring, Brother Bam
[42:45] says it. He says, see then he said time
[42:47] shall no longer but in the days of the
[42:49] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[42:51] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[42:54] be finished as he hath declared unto his
[42:57] servants the prophet. Now watch this in
[43:00] the fourth verse he says and when the
[43:02] seven thunders had uttered their voices
[43:04] I was about to write and I heard a voice
[43:06] from heaven saying unto me seal it up
[43:08] the things which the seven thunders
[43:10] uttered and write them not. Now that's
[43:13] what he spoke. Seal it up to when? When?
[43:16] When? To when shall we seal it up? Now
[43:18] watch in the seventh verse. And the
[43:20] voice. Amen. He says this. But in the
[43:22] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[43:26] when he shall begin to sound, the
[43:28] mystery shall be finished. Seal the
[43:32] thunders until the seventh angel.
[43:36] Amen. Y'all y'all I know y'all enjoy the
[43:38] Bible. I know you enjoy the Bible. In
[43:41] 1964, brother Ram preached and proven
[43:43] his word. And you know what, brother Bam
[43:45] explains to us? He says it like this. As
[43:48] it was in the days of Sodom, now watch.
[43:50] In the days of Sodom, so will it be at
[43:53] the coming of the son of man.
[43:56] Revelations the 10th chapter is
[43:59] fulfilling Luke 17:30.
[44:02] Now, in Matthew 24, it calls it the
[44:04] coming of the son of man. In Luke 17, he
[44:07] calls it the revealing of the son of
[44:09] man. But all of them are being fulfilled
[44:12] in this revelations the 10th chapter
[44:15] which is a vision happening to this man
[44:18] William Brown. No wonder the
[44:20] Pentecostals lost their mind when he
[44:22] started tying together his ministry with
[44:26] the fulfilling of scriptures that they
[44:28] placed at the second advent of the
[44:31] coming of the Lord.
[44:33] Now church. Amen. It's what the prophet
[44:35] taught. He says it like this. He says,
[44:37] "As it was in the days of Sodom, so
[44:39] shall it be in the coming of the Son of
[44:40] Man. When the Son of Man is revealed,
[44:43] not as a church." See, but in the day
[44:45] when the Son of Man will be revealed.
[44:47] Now, what? To join the church to the
[44:50] head. That's you. This message is to
[44:54] join you with the head. Come on now.
[44:58] We're not in the feet. We're not in the
[45:00] legs. We're not in the shoulders. We are
[45:03] a joined to the original headship of
[45:06] almighty God. This message is to join
[45:09] you with the head. And look what he
[45:11] said. It's powerful. He says it like
[45:13] this. In the days the church is to join
[45:14] with the head to unite the marriage of
[45:17] the bride. So this message is not just
[45:20] another Pentecostal message folks. This
[45:22] ain't just another sermon or just
[45:24] another church age. It is the marriage
[45:27] of the lamb. This is the end time event
[45:31] of the day when the bride will be
[45:33] revealed that he has been working on for
[45:36] 2,000 years. This is the unveiling. Come
[45:39] on. I I love how brother Bam says it.
[45:41] The unveiling of God. He's not unveiling
[45:44] God in Jesus Christ. He's unveiling God
[45:47] in the form of the bride of Jesus
[45:50] Christ. This message has elevated you
[45:52] from just another church to the bride of
[45:56] Jesus Christ. This is the elevation, the
[45:58] rapturing up of the church of the living
[46:01] God. I tell you, the bridegroom call is
[46:03] going to come through this.
[46:06] Amen. It's going to come through. Do Do
[46:09] you see this? The Lord is going to come
[46:11] through this.
[46:14] When the son of man, watch this wording,
[46:16] will come down and come in human flesh
[46:19] to unite the truth together. The church
[46:21] has to be the word. He is the word. And
[46:23] the two unites together. See, it'll take
[46:25] the manifestation revealing of the son
[46:27] of man. Now, do you see what I mean?
[46:29] It's the son of man, Jesus Christ will
[46:33] come down. I love his wording. It will
[46:36] come down in human flesh among us and
[46:40] make his word so real. Now, watch that.
[46:44] Revelations 10 again. A mighty angel is
[46:48] coming down.
[46:50] Now, who is that angel?
[46:52] only Christ
[46:55] it could be. Now, I want you to watch
[46:58] something carefully. When brother
[46:59] Brandon was on the platform using
[47:01] Messiah sign, he never says, "I'm going
[47:04] to do what Paul did."
[47:08] Because it wasn't a reoccurrence of
[47:10] Apostle Paul's ministry.
[47:13] It was the ministry of Jesus Christ that
[47:17] was promised to return to the church in
[47:19] the last days. Now, if you you said,
[47:22] "Preacher, come down. Come down. An
[47:24] angel come down." Well, let's just read
[47:26] in John 6 and see what Jesus said. He
[47:29] said, "Jesus said, verily I say unto
[47:31] you, Moses gave you not bread from
[47:33] heaven, but my father giveth you true
[47:36] bread from heaven."
[47:39] For the bread of God he is, which cometh
[47:41] down from heaven, and gaveth unto the
[47:44] world. Now, watch in that 40th verse. He
[47:46] says it like this. And this is the will
[47:48] of him that sent me. everyone believeth
[47:49] on him. Excuse me. I And the 38th verse,
[47:52] he said, "For I have come down from
[47:55] heaven, not to do my own will, but to
[47:58] them that Can you imagine the people
[47:59] that were watching Jesus? You come down
[48:02] from heaven." Well, I knew you when you
[48:05] was 10year-old working in your dad's
[48:07] shop.
[48:08] Now, what do you mean you come down from
[48:10] heaven?
[48:12] Amen. Now, that word come down is a
[48:15] Greek word, and I could spell it for
[48:17] you. K A T A B A I N O. Somebody that's
[48:20] more proficient might speak it for us.
[48:23] But it's kabino meaning I come down
[48:26] either from sky or higher land or a
[48:29] descending.
[48:31] It's the usage meaning to describe the
[48:34] action of descending or going down.
[48:36] Amen. It now what what is what is what's
[48:38] it saying?
[48:40] Jesus the father God had been in the
[48:44] spirit realm but had come down through
[48:47] the fulfillment of scriptures. Amen.
[48:50] Behold a virgin shall conceive had
[48:53] manifested God on the earth through that
[48:57] manifested word and now Jesus was
[48:59] standing there saying I have come down.
[49:02] In other words, God had condescended
[49:04] through the fulfillment of his own
[49:06] prophecies and the word of God. Amen.
[49:09] That's why in 1 Thessalonians 4, now I
[49:11] got some Bible for you. 1 Thessalonians
[49:13] 4, watch in the 16th verse. For the Lord
[49:16] himself,
[49:19] shall descend.
[49:21] That's the same word that's in
[49:23] Revelations 10:1, the Greek. It's the
[49:26] same word that's in John the 6th
[49:28] chapter. Amen. When Jesus said, "I come
[49:31] down," the Bible said the Lord himself
[49:33] would come down. And brother Brandham
[49:35] says he will come through this ministry.
[49:39] He will come down through this ministry.
[49:42] Oh church of the living God, this
[49:45] message has put us in the presence of
[49:47] the Messiah. It's not just a schooling
[49:49] or a learning or a cult as some would
[49:52] have you think. It is the resurrection
[49:55] of Jesus Christ making him the same
[49:58] yesterday, today, and forever. It's a
[50:01] higher calling. He came down that we
[50:04] might go up. It's a coming down of God.
[50:07] This day, this scripture is fulfilled in
[50:10] your midst. You said, "Preacher, I tell
[50:12] you that, hey, man, this has been going
[50:13] on the whole time." No, it ain't. In
[50:15] Acts the 3rd chapter, watching the 20th
[50:17] verse, "And he shall send at 20th verse,
[50:20] Acts 3 and 20. and he shall send Jesus
[50:22] Christ which is preached unto you whom
[50:25] the heavens must receive until the times
[50:29] of the
[50:31] restitution of all things. Now here here
[50:34] Jesus has been on the earth and has left
[50:36] and went into the heavens and all things
[50:39] wasn't restored when he was there.
[50:40] Right? Not all things had become
[50:43] restituted when he was there. You said
[50:45] preacher, what are you saying? It's
[50:46] going to take those seven thunders
[50:48] opening before the church returns to the
[50:51] original position.
[50:54] Hey, now you say now
[50:56] preacher let's just take it for a moment
[50:59] in Revelation 10 and4. Amen. Seal it up.
[51:02] In Revelations 10 and 7 is when it would
[51:04] be revealed the seventh angel. All
[51:06] right. Now, let's read Revelations 1
[51:08] and3. Blessed is he that readeth, and
[51:10] they that hearth the words of this
[51:12] prophecy, and keep the things which are
[51:14] written, for the time is at hand. Now, I
[51:16] want you to notice Paul has been dead
[51:19] for about he's been sleeping for about
[51:22] 40 years.
[51:24] Paul has not been on the scene for years
[51:27] now. When John writes the book of
[51:30] Revelations, right? Now, Paul didn't
[51:33] know what John was writing in the book
[51:35] of Revelations. And so I preach a lot
[51:37] and you heard me preach. We preach what
[51:39] Paul preached, right? So the things
[51:42] that's in the message are not
[51:43] contradictory with what Paul taught. But
[51:46] Paul didn't teach you the revelation of
[51:48] theophony when he was here. He only
[51:50] spoke of it and left it.
[51:54] He spoke of it and said, "There's some
[51:56] things I'd like to say, but can't say
[51:58] them now." That's Come on, church. The
[52:01] book of Hebrews said, "I got some
[52:02] teaching on Melkazedc, but you can't
[52:05] take it, but strong meat belong to them
[52:08] that are full age." And then in
[52:10] Ephesians 4, he said there would be a
[52:12] building up of the church under the
[52:14] stature of the fullness of time. And
[52:15] then also in Hebrews 11, he said they
[52:18] without us cannot be made. Come on.
[52:21] What's he saying to us? There is
[52:23] something that I am beginning, but
[52:25] there's coming something that's going to
[52:27] finish this. I'm laying a foundation,
[52:29] but the head is coming. There is coming
[52:32] a church. There is coming a bride, a
[52:34] mature bride that'll come on the last
[52:36] days. Amen. What is it? There'll be a
[52:39] time this will be at hand. Now, in
[52:41] Revelation 1 and verse three, times at
[52:43] hand. Now, listen here. Here now, if you
[52:46] read C, can we read this? Revelation 22.
[52:49] Let's read the ninth
[52:51] verse. Amen. If you if you back up to
[52:53] the eth verse even Revelation 22 and
[52:55] verse 8, I want you to watch this
[52:58] ministry. And I, John, saw these things
[53:00] and heard them. And when I heard them
[53:02] and seen them, I fell down to worship
[53:04] before the feet of the angel which
[53:05] showed me these things.
[53:09] Now, I'm home, folks.
[53:14] Let me ask y'all something. When did
[53:16] John write
[53:18] this? In AD60.
[53:22] or in 1960
[53:28] he was caught up where
[53:32] he was seeing things that had not yet
[53:36] been transpired.
[53:38] But there was an angel giving him the
[53:41] revelation of what he was writing down
[53:44] that hadn't happened yet. Right.
[53:47] Now,
[53:49] now let's just see because the angel
[53:52] that was giving him the revelation, John
[53:54] tried to worship him.
[53:57] He's representing who? The bride. And
[54:00] they're trying to worship who?
[54:04] And he's saying, "Don't you worship me.
[54:08] I'm just your brother. I'm no more than
[54:11] you are. I am your brother." Come on,
[54:13] church. There's a little girl standing
[54:15] in a cavern and all the lights is off.
[54:19] And there's a brother standing next to
[54:21] her and what's he say? Little sister,
[54:24] there is a man here that can turn on the
[54:26] lights. William Brandom was your brother
[54:29] standing next to you in the darkness
[54:31] saying there's a man here. There's a man
[54:34] here that can turn on the lights. He
[54:37] wasn't our God. He's our prophet.
[54:40] Hey, but I tell you this, I won't back
[54:42] off of it. I'm not ashamed of it. I
[54:44] don't care who does what or where they
[54:46] go. Amen. There's a message that is
[54:48] coming to this generation. The prophet's
[54:51] name is William Brandom. These seals
[54:53] have been opened up for the rapturing of
[54:55] this bride. And they may not
[54:58] theologically answer what some people
[55:00] would like to hear. But brother, there's
[55:02] a time to forget what you know and begin
[55:04] to submit yourself to God.
[55:09] Amen. He told him to don't do it. I am
[55:11] your fellow servant. I could break the
[55:12] end of this real strong for you if you
[55:14] wanted me to. But if you'll just watch
[55:16] it, fellow servant, brethren, prophet,
[55:19] right? Yeah. Fellow servant, brother,
[55:22] prophet. He's explaining to you right
[55:24] here. And he said, then you just worship
[55:26] God. What's the next verse? He saith
[55:28] unto me, see it not. I'm thy fellow
[55:29] servant, the prophets. Now watch what he
[55:31] says in the 10th verse. And he saith
[55:33] unto me, seal not the sayings of this
[55:36] prophecy. Now when was them Gibia
[55:38] unsealed? All right. 104 it was sealed.
[55:42] 10:7 it's unsealed. And what's this
[55:45] prophet saying to John in 10 22:10?
[55:49] Unseal it. Look at the ministry of the
[55:52] man talking to John. It's been sealed
[55:55] and nobody could unseal it. But unseal
[55:58] it now. John, it's time for the
[56:01] unsealing. Can I say it very plainly?
[56:03] Let the thunders thunder. Let the seals
[56:06] loose. Preach the message of the hour.
[56:09] It is the food that's in season in this
[56:12] generation. Seal not the sayings. Amen.
[56:15] Don't seal the sayings of this message.
[56:17] Don't don't don't try, Amen, to water it
[56:20] down to help people out. You can't help
[56:22] people by hiding the truth. You can't
[56:24] help people by being ashamed of this
[56:27] message. Come on. We need some men with
[56:29] courage to take the message of the hour
[56:32] and preach it with
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:36] the time is at hand.
[56:39] Amen. I thank God for the ministry we
[56:42] got in this church. I do. I appreciate
[56:43] God. And some of you are traveling. Some
[56:45] of them coming. Amen. Brother Jonathan's
[56:47] Amen. Come among us. And he's going to
[56:49] he's going to be I can't travel like I
[56:51] used to. Amen. But he's going to do a
[56:52] lot of traveling. Brother Alice's going
[56:54] to do a lot of traveling. These men's
[56:55] going to do a lot of traveling. And what
[56:57] are they going to be preaching? What use
[56:58] is it to and to travel? Why why are we
[57:01] taking your tithing and putting behind
[57:03] these men? Because we believe it makes a
[57:05] difference. I believe it makes a
[57:07] difference if somebody preaches this
[57:09] message. I believe we are to send people
[57:12] into this age to tell them God sent a
[57:15] prophet and introduce Jesus Christ to
[57:17] you.
[57:20] Hallelujah.
[57:22] Don't use the prophet to take away from
[57:23] Christ. All right. Elevate Christ.
[57:28] Yes, sir. Do you see what it is? The
[57:29] time is at hand. When the book is to be
[57:31] revealed, Brother Bram said that's when
[57:33] the time is at hand. When it's to be
[57:35] revealed, he's a signifying angel.
[57:37] Brother Bram says it in Revelation in in
[57:39] the fifth seal. How many knows he
[57:40] teaches in the fifth seal that the eagle
[57:42] John's talking about is the one that's
[57:43] to come.
[57:45] Fifth seal. You can go look it up,
[57:46] paragraph 205. John was looking at him.
[57:49] Let me ask you this. Have you ever
[57:51] followed Brother Bam's ministry?
[57:54] and looked at it in the book of
[57:55] Revelations.
[57:57] What's the first recorded sermon? We got
[58:00] deity of Jesus Christ. What's the first
[58:02] chapter of Revelations about
[58:06] what's the next big series? Brother
[58:08] Bannham holds the church ages. What
[58:11] happens in Revelations 2 and Revelations
[58:14] 3?
[58:15] Then brother Bannam behind the church
[58:17] ages preaches throne and takes the whole
[58:20] fourth chapter. And then he comes in,
[58:22] takes the fifth chapter and preaches
[58:24] five, six, and seven in the seals. And
[58:27] then turn around and comes in
[58:28] Revelations 10 to pull in Revelations
[58:30] 19, Revelation 22. It's his own
[58:34] ministry.
[58:36] It's laid out in the book of Revelations
[58:38] the same way he preached it on the earth
[58:41] when he was here.
[58:45] You can follow it right in the Bible.
[58:48] Do you think he just picked the
[58:49] revelations and started going down
[58:51] through it?
[58:55] It was God
[58:58] sending a prophet in our age because
[59:00] this book of Revelations, Brother Cable,
[59:02] it was it was in symbol form. Yeah.
[59:05] Don't you know God did that on purpose?
[59:07] He hid it. Put it in symbol form. Hid
[59:10] it. and and it's the only book that's in
[59:14] the New Testament that is specifically
[59:16] written to you.
[59:19] Look, it's specifically written to you.
[59:21] Now, I I've said it like this. If you
[59:23] let's just say you want to get a private
[59:25] letter to your wife, Amen. and you're a
[59:27] long ways away and it's it's it's a most
[59:29] important they don't mess with it. They
[59:31] don't misinterpret it. So you write it
[59:34] in symbols and you send it to your bride
[59:37] and she gets your letter in symbols and
[59:40] then you send a vindicated servant to
[59:42] her to just tell her what the symbols
[59:44] mean. Then it could pass through as many
[59:47] hands as you wanted to and nobody could
[59:51] alter it because they don't know what
[59:52] the symbols mean. So 2,000 years of
[59:55] church couldn't change the book of
[59:57] Revelations. But in the end, God sends a
[1:00:00] prophet and says the symbol means this
[1:00:02] and the symbol means this and the symbol
[1:00:04] means this and nobody can impersonate
[1:00:07] it.
[1:00:09] Hallelujah. It's the book of Revelations
[1:00:11] and it's written for you. Hallelujah. It
[1:00:15] is a love letter for the bride of Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ. It's the time at hand. It wasn't
[1:00:20] written for them. It was written for
[1:00:22] you. I got brother Bam directly saying
[1:00:25] it. It wasn't written for them. It was
[1:00:26] written for you. That's why in
[1:00:28] revelation chapter 3 and the 14th verse
[1:00:30] the Bible said and under the church of
[1:00:32] the leotans he says it this under the
[1:00:35] church of the leottheanss under the
[1:00:37] angel of the
[1:00:38] church. Unto the angel of the church the
[1:00:41] word angel means amen messenger under
[1:00:44] the messenger of the church of the
[1:00:46] leadyans. Somebody said what does that
[1:00:48] mean angel? Look in revelations 1 and
[1:00:50] 16. And I saw in the right hand seven
[1:00:53] stars and out of the mouth went a sharp
[1:00:55] two-edged sword. Somebody said, "What
[1:00:57] does these things mean?" Revelations
[1:00:59] 1:20 and 20 will tell you, "The mystery
[1:01:01] of the seven stars, which thou sawest in
[1:01:03] thine hand, is the seven golden
[1:01:05] candlesticks. The stars are the angels
[1:01:07] of the seven churches, and the
[1:01:09] candlesticks are which thou sawest are
[1:01:12] the seven churches."
[1:01:15] So, in the hand of God was seven angels.
[1:01:17] Now, in Daniel's 70th week, you know,
[1:01:19] Daniel was placed on time. He was pushed
[1:01:22] on 70 weeks. But the church, the gentile
[1:01:26] church was placed on stars.
[1:01:29] They tell their time by stars. And when
[1:01:32] the seventh star comes, he's the seventh
[1:01:34] angel. He's the last star to the age. He
[1:01:37] is the end time sign to the age. The
[1:01:42] seventh angel of Revelation chapter 3 is
[1:01:45] the same angel of Revelation chapter 10
[1:01:48] and verse 7. Unseal it in the time of
[1:01:52] the end. It is an end time seal. It is
[1:01:55] an end time message. It is an end time
[1:01:58] event. Now, when this message comes, it
[1:02:02] comes when this message comes, brother
[1:02:04] man goes to Revelations the 10th chapter
[1:02:06] and he says this book, he said this book
[1:02:08] that's coming into his hand. Now, now
[1:02:10] watch this. He says this book, he says
[1:02:12] in Revelations the fifth chapter, you
[1:02:15] can't read it. You can't touch it. And
[1:02:18] John has weeped because no man has been
[1:02:21] able to.
[1:02:24] But he says, "But there's one standing
[1:02:26] there that says there is one worthy."
[1:02:31] There is one worthy. And remember what
[1:02:33] brother Bram says. You if you listen to
[1:02:34] it, go back to the breach and listen to
[1:02:36] it. And brother Bram's coming along and
[1:02:38] he starts describing this and he said,
[1:02:41] "Nobody could take this book. Nobody
[1:02:42] could touch this book. Nobody could have
[1:02:44] this book."
[1:02:45] And he said, 'But now there's only one
[1:02:47] worthy. And he takes a while to prove
[1:02:50] that no man, no angel. He said, 'Oh,
[1:02:53] there might be an angel, but he wasn't
[1:02:55] kin. So, it had to be the man Christ
[1:02:57] Jesus. And then, Brother Bram steps
[1:03:00] back and he said, "Now is the
[1:03:03] time. Let him come forward now." Yes,
[1:03:07] sir. Or forever hold his peace. Yeah.
[1:03:12] And the most powerful scripture in the
[1:03:14] Bible, the Bible said, "And he come
[1:03:17] forth
[1:03:18] and he took the book."
[1:03:21] He took the book at the same time there
[1:03:25] was a prophet on the
[1:03:27] earth. Because when he took that book
[1:03:30] and he started speaking, he was speaking
[1:03:32] through
[1:03:34] a prophet.
[1:03:35] The lamb was speaking through a prophet.
[1:03:38] Now, now somebody says, "Brother Wayne,
[1:03:40] what what what is the importance of all
[1:03:42] this?"
[1:03:43] Oh, according to Romans the 8th chapter,
[1:03:47] that in the
[1:03:48] days when the sons of men would be
[1:03:51] manifested, when God, sons of God,
[1:03:55] would come to manifestation according to
[1:03:57] scripture, the whole creation groanth
[1:04:02] and wadeth
[1:04:04] until sons would be born in the earth.
[1:04:07] that would be manifested, sons of God.
[1:04:10] Amen. The Bible tells us this, that the
[1:04:12] creature will be liberated. The earth
[1:04:15] will set back in its original Eden
[1:04:18] condition. Amen. When sons begin to be
[1:04:21] manifested, all that God had lost will
[1:04:23] be restored in its great masterpiece.
[1:04:26] It'll be put back together again. You
[1:04:28] say, "Preacher, what are you talking
[1:04:30] about?" And I say this, if this message
[1:04:32] has the power to set the world back in a
[1:04:34] millennial kingdom, if it has the power
[1:04:36] to set the earth back and bring Eden on
[1:04:39] to end the ages and set forth a new
[1:04:42] dispensation, how much greater is the
[1:04:44] power of that message to liberate you
[1:04:47] from your addictions, from your habits,
[1:04:50] from your struggles, from your cycles?
[1:04:52] This message is not just theology, but
[1:04:55] it is a doctrine that will loose you.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] Amen. What did John say? The axe is laid
[1:05:03] at the root of the tree. And there's
[1:05:04] been doctrines that have been put in
[1:05:06] your mind and had you held bondage. It
[1:05:09] held you held. Had made you believe you
[1:05:12] never were a son. You never could be a
[1:05:13] son. I'm going to climb my way back to
[1:05:16] heaven. I'm going to work. I'm going to
[1:05:17] work. I'm going to work. I'm going to
[1:05:18] But when the message came, a prophet
[1:05:21] said, "You always were a son. You always
[1:05:24] were a son. And the blood has been shed
[1:05:27] for you." and this message was
[1:05:29] liberating you. You said, "Preacher,
[1:05:32] really, what's so important about it?"
[1:05:33] I'll tell you what's important. That the
[1:05:35] Bible said them that had their names on
[1:05:37] the Lamb's Book of Life, Amen. Those
[1:05:39] names were indelibly written and can't
[1:05:41] be taken out of here, and sin can't be
[1:05:44] added in here, and they'll be a part of
[1:05:46] the rapture.
[1:05:48] And this message called your name.
[1:05:55] Glory be to God. I say throw down your
[1:05:58] baggage. Throw away your popcorn. Throw
[1:06:00] the pop out of your hand. It's time to
[1:06:02] go. It's time to get into the revelation
[1:06:05] of the word of God. It's the flashing
[1:06:08] red lights. It's the sign of his coming.
[1:06:11] We are a part of this.
[1:06:15] [Applause]
[1:06:16] Stand to your feet with me tonight.
[1:06:19] We are a part of this. Amen. Thank you.
[1:06:22] This message is cla but Alex. He claimed
[1:06:25] us with all of our issues, all of our
[1:06:27] struggles, all of our tri. Thank God he
[1:06:30] could claim us all. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] Dallas, when he took you, he took your
[1:06:38] shame.
[1:06:40] He took your glory. He took your
[1:06:43] everything.
[1:06:44] And he said, "Well, I'm going to shave
[1:06:46] this off and I'm going to shave that off
[1:06:48] and I'm going to shave that off, but
[1:06:49] you're his book." That's right. and
[1:06:51] you're revealed.
[1:06:53] No, this won't be revealed till the
[1:06:55] seventh angel sounds.
[1:06:58] But in his sounding
[1:07:00] is our liberating.
[1:07:02] Amen.
[1:07:04] In his
[1:07:05] sounding, the seven seal ends all
[1:07:09] things. Amen. Our brother Samson Tay
[1:07:12] ain't with us anymore. I wish you'd knew
[1:07:14] him. You'd like that guy.
[1:07:16] I was in Israel with Chrisa was with us
[1:07:18] there. We was at the pull of Bethesda
[1:07:22] and he got to preaching on that pull of
[1:07:23] Bethesda. We were right there looking at
[1:07:25] it. It was pretty powerful. Brother
[1:07:28] Sansson was loaded too, you know. He
[1:07:30] looked over at that pool and he said, he
[1:07:32] said it like this. He said, "Everybody
[1:07:33] was waiting to get in that pool. They
[1:07:35] waiting for the season." He said, "But
[1:07:37] one day, he said, the one that made the
[1:07:40] seasons come to the pool." Oh yeah.
[1:07:44] And he said it was the end of struggling
[1:07:47] nature. Brother, I'll never forget that
[1:07:50] as long as I lived, it is the end of
[1:07:52] struggling the nature you struggle with.
[1:07:56] This seven seal has come to put an end
[1:07:58] to it.
[1:08:00] It's come to put an end to it. This word
[1:08:02] that has brought forth in this age is
[1:08:05] your identity.
[1:08:07] The mystery of who you are and what
[1:08:08] you're here for and what you're going to
[1:08:10] do. And I'm so glad we're a part of it.
[1:08:12] Ain't you? Amen. I'm so thankful
[1:08:14] tonight. Hallelujah. To be a part of
[1:08:16] this. Amen. We We thank God for it
[1:08:19] tonight. Amen. Brother Ben, you got
[1:08:21] something? Hallelujah.
