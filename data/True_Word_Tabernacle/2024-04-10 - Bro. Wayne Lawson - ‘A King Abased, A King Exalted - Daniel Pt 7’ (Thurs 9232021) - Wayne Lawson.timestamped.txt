[4:22] looking in the Book of Daniel Amen got
[4:24] some things here so he's just going to
[4:26] read for us
[4:28] tonight
[4:32] Daniel chapter
[4:34] 4 we'll read the first eight verses and
[4:36] then skip over to verse
[4:42] 19 Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all
[4:45] people Nations and languages that dwell
[4:48] in all the Earth peace be multiplied
[4:50] unto you I thought it good to show the
[4:53] signs and wonders that the high God hath
[4:54] wrought toward me how great are his
[4:57] signs and how Mighty are his wonders his
[5:00] kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and
[5:02] his Dominion is from generation to
[5:05] generation I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest
[5:07] in my house and flourishing in my Palace
[5:10] and I saw a dream which made me afraid
[5:13] and the thoughts upon my bed and the
[5:14] visions of my head troubled me therefore
[5:17] made I a decree to bring in all the wise
[5:19] men of Babylon before me that they might
[5:22] make known to me the interpretation of
[5:24] the dream then came The Magicians the
[5:26] astrologers the Chaldeans and the
[5:28] soothsayers and and I told the dream
[5:30] before them but they did not make known
[5:32] unto me the interpretation thereof but
[5:34] at the last Daniel came in before me
[5:37] whose name was belto shazar according to
[5:39] the name of my God and in whom is the
[5:42] spirit of the Holy gods and before him I
[5:45] told the dream and then he summarizes
[5:47] the dream for Daniel and then we pick it
[5:50] up in verse 19 then Daniel whose name
[5:52] was
[5:53] belthazar was astonished for one hour
[5:55] and his thoughts troubled him the king
[5:58] spake and said Bel shazar let not the
[6:00] dream or the interpretation thereof
[6:02] trouble thee belto shazar answered and
[6:05] said my Lord the dream be to them that
[6:07] hate thee and the interpretation thereof
[6:09] to thine enemies the tree that thou
[6:11] sawest which grew and was strong whose
[6:14] height reached unto the Heaven and the
[6:16] sight thereof to all the Earth whose
[6:18] leaves were fair and the fruit thereof
[6:21] much and in it was meat for all under
[6:23] which the beasts of the field dwelt and
[6:25] upon whose branches the fowls of the
[6:27] heavens had their habitation it is that
[6:29] thou O King that art grown and become
[6:32] strong for thy greatness is grown and
[6:34] reacheth unto heaven and thy Dominion to
[6:37] the end of the Earth and whereas the
[6:39] king saw a watcher and a holy one coming
[6:41] down from heaven and saying heue the
[6:44] tree down and destroy it yet leave the
[6:46] stump of the roots thereof in the earth
[6:48] even with a band of iron and Brass in
[6:51] the tender grass of the field and let it
[6:53] be wet with the de of heaven and let his
[6:55] portion be with the beasts of the field
[6:57] till seven times pass over him this is
[7:00] the interpretation O King and this is
[7:03] the decree of the most high which has
[7:04] come upon my Lord the king that they
[7:06] shall Drive thee from men and thy
[7:08] dwelling shall be with the beasts of the
[7:10] field and they shall make thee to meet
[7:12] to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet
[7:14] thee with the Dew of heaven and seven
[7:17] times shall pass over thee till thou
[7:18] know that the most high ruleth in the
[7:21] Kingdom of men and giveth it to
[7:23] whomsoever he will and whereas they
[7:26] commanded to leave the stump of the tree
[7:27] roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto
[7:29] thee after that thou shalt have known
[7:32] that the heavens do rule wherefore oh
[7:34] King let my counsel be acceptable unto
[7:36] thee and break off thy sins by
[7:38] righteousness and thine iniquities by
[7:40] showing Mercy to the poor if it may be a
[7:43] lengthening of thy tranquility and all
[7:45] this came upon the King Nebuchadnezzar
[7:48] at the end of 12 months he walked in the
[7:50] Palace of the kingdom of Babylon and the
[7:51] King spake and said is not this great
[7:54] Babylon that I have built for the house
[7:56] of the Kingdom by the might of my power
[7:59] and for the honor of my Majesty while
[8:02] the word was in the king's mouth there
[8:04] fell a voice from Heaven saying oh King
[8:05] Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the
[8:08] kingdom is departed from thee and they
[8:10] shall Drive thee from men thy dwelling
[8:12] shall be with the beasts of the field
[8:13] and they shall make make thee to eat
[8:15] grass as oxen and seven times shall pass
[8:17] over thee until thou know that the most
[8:20] high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and he
[8:23] giveth it to whomsoever he will the same
[8:25] hour was the thing fulfilled upon
[8:27] Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from
[8:28] Men did heat grass as oxen and his body
[8:31] was wet with the Dew of Heaven till his
[8:33] hairs were grown like Eagle's feathers
[8:35] and his nails like Bird's Claws and at
[8:38] the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar
[8:40] lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine
[8:42] understanding returned unto me and I
[8:44] bless the most high and I praise and
[8:47] honored him that liveth forever whose
[8:49] Dominion is an everlasting dominion and
[8:51] his kingdom is from generation to
[8:53] generation and all the inhabitants of
[8:55] the Earth are reputed as nothing and he
[8:58] doeth according to to his will in the
[9:00] army of heaven and among the inhabitants
[9:02] of the earth and none can stay his hand
[9:04] or say unto him what doest thou at the
[9:07] same time my reason returned unto me and
[9:09] for the glory of my Kingdom Mine honor
[9:11] and brightness return unto me and my
[9:14] counselors and my lords sought unto me
[9:16] and I was established in my kingdom and
[9:18] excellent Majesty was added unto me now
[9:21] I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and
[9:24] honor the kingdom the king of Heaven all
[9:28] whose works are truth and his ways
[9:30] judgment and those that walk in Pride he
[9:33] is able to abase
[9:36] amen God bless you you may be
[9:39] seated I want to speak to you a little
[9:41] bit tonight from this section of
[9:43] scripture Daniel 4 uh I think that is
[9:46] the first time uh that I've ever took it
[9:48] as a subject of course of of looking at
[9:50] it so I've uh been taking a little extra
[9:53] time and the study of it and I found
[9:55] some what I believe to be some
[9:57] tremendous things but I think there's an
[9:58] object in
[9:59] a real serious lesson to be learned in
[10:02] this portion of scripture and of course
[10:04] we are not Kings uh and it it as far as
[10:07] a natural king and the kingdoms that's
[10:09] not going to apply to us but I do think
[10:11] that it has some great application unto
[10:14] the Church of the Living God to learn
[10:16] some things uh from what this king lived
[10:18] through amen and uh as we're of course
[10:21] reading here we're looking at a time
[10:23] period when Nebuchadnezzar has been
[10:25] given actually been given the rule of
[10:28] the entire Earth now his the the might
[10:31] of Nebuchadnezzar is so powerful that he
[10:34] actually has a sovereign rule of the
[10:37] world there's nobody been able to uh
[10:40] overcome him or nobody's been able to do
[10:42] anything to withstand him but the reason
[10:45] that he has what he has is because God
[10:48] has actually given this Dominion to him
[10:51] uh he actually is the fellow
[10:52] Nebuchadnezzar this king is the one who
[10:54] has overcome Israel he has crushed down
[10:58] the Temple of Israel he's carried away
[11:00] the children of Israel and as far as
[11:02] he's concerned there's nobody who has
[11:05] any authority over him and the longer
[11:07] that he rules the more he becomes sure
[11:10] that he's the man and he has everything
[11:13] in control amen but now here is the
[11:16] reason that he is a ruler in Jeremiah 27
[11:19] veres 5 to8 amen it says I have made the
[11:22] earth and the man the Beast and thereup
[11:24] the ground by my great power and by my
[11:26] outstretched arm and have given it unto
[11:29] whom it seemed meet unto me and now I
[11:32] have given all the lands unto the hand
[11:34] of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my
[11:37] servant and the Beast of the field have
[11:39] I given him to serve him and all nations
[11:42] Shall Serve him and his son and his
[11:44] son's son until the very time of this
[11:47] land come and many nations and great
[11:49] Kings Shall Serve themselves of him and
[11:52] it shall come to pass in the nation and
[11:54] the kingdom which will not serve
[11:56] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and
[11:58] that will not put their neck under the
[12:00] Yoke of the king of Babylon that Nation
[12:02] will I punish sayth the Lord with a
[12:05] sword and with a famine and with
[12:07] pestilence until I have consumed them by
[12:11] his hand now so so the reason that he
[12:13] had this ultimate power and authority
[12:16] upon the Earth was simply because God
[12:19] was using him he was a tool in the hand
[12:22] of God God had raised him up now if
[12:25] you're a of course a studier of
[12:27] scripture God has raised him up to deal
[12:30] with Israel because of their arrogance
[12:33] and their belief that they could worship
[12:35] anybody or do anything because of who
[12:37] they were but God was teaching Israel
[12:40] something that you cannot serve other
[12:42] gods and remain in the place that you
[12:45] are so he's raised up Nebuchadnezzar
[12:47] he's brought them underneath the place
[12:49] that they're living and now
[12:51] Nebuchadnezzar is becoming lifted up
[12:53] within himself and his rule he's
[12:55] impressing himself and and the more the
[12:58] higher he gets the more Authority he has
[13:00] the more rule he has uh the more
[13:03] self-centered he's becoming the more
[13:05] prideful he's becoming maybe could I say
[13:08] this his character is not keeping up
[13:10] with his position other words he's
[13:12] growing in position he's growing in
[13:14] power but he's not growing in character
[13:17] now this is something that I believe
[13:19] that every Christian must take great
[13:21] heed to is to remember that with
[13:25] position and with authority your
[13:27] character must grow with that because if
[13:30] you ever outgrow your character amen you
[13:33] become a trouble for yourself you become
[13:35] trouble for everyone around you you know
[13:38] uh that that's the problem with with
[13:39] sports actually there's uh we have
[13:41] people who can carry a football and
[13:43] they're so talented at it but they're
[13:45] usually end up in prison maybe for rape
[13:47] or some kind of dope charges or
[13:49] something because they're talented
[13:51] they're gifted but they have no
[13:52] character to go with the gift so that
[13:54] there's nothing there now you know uh uh
[13:56] maybe maybe there this could go a lot
[13:58] deeper but I think you're getting the
[14:00] point that the character must accompany
[14:03] the position and here this man is a king
[14:06] and he's setting in a rule and Authority
[14:09] but he's getting a hard heart he's
[14:11] getting a hotty life and and and and and
[14:14] now what we must always remember is some
[14:17] things that a prophet will have to say
[14:19] now let's just just hear Brother badam a
[14:21] moment in a message hear ye him he says
[14:23] humility the way down is always the way
[14:27] up he says that we will humble himself
[14:30] he said God will exalt him and he that
[14:32] exalteth himself he shall be abased now
[14:36] the way down is the way up for a
[14:39] Believer if he'll humble himself before
[14:41] God now I'll go to he cares do you care
[14:44] now if you're if you're if you're
[14:46] interested in the way these sermons lay
[14:48] I thought this was amazing when I'm
[14:50] studying this uh Book of Daniel the 4th
[14:52] chapter I I get a message on my heart
[14:55] entitled a warning before judgment and
[14:58] so I I'm the guy that if I'm going to
[15:00] listen to One him before judgment I want
[15:01] to know what he preached three sermons
[15:03] before he got there is there something
[15:05] he's building up to and of course there
[15:07] was if you go listen you'll listen to a
[15:09] sermon called why Christ speak and the
[15:12] very next sermon brother Brown will
[15:13] preach a message called humble thyself
[15:16] he just talks about having the power of
[15:19] the spoken word and the very next sermon
[15:21] is humble thyself amen and the very next
[15:25] sermon is he says he cares do you care
[15:28] and then he preaches a warning then a
[15:31] judgment and the next sermon of course
[15:33] is Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[15:35] but in this he cares to you care it's
[15:37] very powerful because brother Ram will
[15:39] say you've got to be clothed with
[15:41] humility before God resisteth the proud
[15:45] and giveth grace to the humble he he
[15:47] says therefore humble yourselves under
[15:49] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[15:51] thee in due time casting your care upon
[15:54] him for he carth for you so he's tying
[15:57] together humble thyself with a message
[15:59] he cares do you care amen and and in
[16:02] saying that he's reading the book of
[16:04] Peter as a text amen that we should
[16:06] humble ourselves before God that he may
[16:09] exalt Us in due time and if you care he
[16:12] cares he cares for you is that right
[16:15] then see then brother ra must teach us
[16:17] he cares now after after God knows that
[16:20] judgment is coming on the earth he still
[16:23] does something because he cares for the
[16:25] people amen now the the the difference
[16:27] between people who can receive the care
[16:30] of God and them that don't receive the
[16:31] care of God is the difference in the
[16:33] spirit to be able to receive the message
[16:36] or the word amen and in many cases the
[16:39] correction of the word it'll take
[16:41] character now the scripture Will Tell Us
[16:43] in the book of Isaiah 57 in the 15th
[16:46] verse that God says thus saith the high
[16:48] and the lofty one that inhabiteth the
[16:50] eternities whose name is Holy he said I
[16:53] dwell in a high and holy place with them
[16:57] also that is of a contrite and a humble
[17:00] Spirit to revive the spirit of the
[17:02] humble and to revive the heart of a
[17:04] contrite one in Pro ver 16 and 19 amen
[17:09] he said better is it to be a humble
[17:11] spirit with the lowly than to divide the
[17:13] spoil with the proud in Proverbs 22 and4
[17:17] by humility and the fear of the Lord are
[17:19] riches and honor and life in 29 and 23
[17:22] he said a man's Pride shall bring him
[17:24] low but honor shall uphold the humble in
[17:27] spirit in Matthew 18 Jesus said
[17:30] whosoever shall humble himself as a
[17:32] little child the same is the greatest in
[17:35] the Kingdom of Heaven in James he said
[17:38] humble thyselves in the sight of the
[17:40] Lord and He Shall lift thee up amen I
[17:43] think it's amazing that the Bible said
[17:46] that in book of Peter we should humble
[17:47] ourselves ye younger submit yourselves
[17:49] to the Elder amen and all of you be
[17:52] subject one to another and be clothed
[17:54] with humility for God resisteth the
[17:57] proud and give give Grace unto the
[18:00] humble I tell you that's a powerful
[18:02] thing Amen to know that God resisteth
[18:04] the proud but giveth Grace unto the
[18:07] humble humble yourselves therefore amen
[18:10] now I I I I think this is very powerful
[18:12] right here and what Apostle Peter is
[18:14] saying I believe is exactly applicable
[18:17] to this scripture that if we would
[18:19] humble ourselves then God doesn't have
[18:21] to Humble us but when we re when we
[18:24] absolutely refuse to Humble ourselves
[18:27] then God always has a way of bringing
[18:30] humility to an individual that he's
[18:33] planning on using amen see see the
[18:35] scriptures are clear that Nebuchadnezzar
[18:37] was in the hands of the Lord and God was
[18:39] not going to forget him and God was not
[18:42] done with him but he was done with him
[18:44] as far as he could use him until he was
[18:46] ready to Humble himself now I I'm just
[18:49] reading this and I can can I can I say a
[18:51] little something to you before I
[18:52] continue preaching amen I know this is
[18:54] the first time I've spoke in a little
[18:56] while and and to come back I actually
[18:57] argue with the Lord about preaching this
[18:59] kind of sermon I said Lord I a spoke to
[19:01] the church a little while I hate to come
[19:03] preach in this kind of sermon so I I
[19:05] want you all to know I I'm not trying to
[19:08] say this applies to anyone here at the
[19:10] church or the church this is part of the
[19:12] series I think it's good for every
[19:13] Christian but let me just put it out
[19:15] real straight okay amen I I personally
[19:18] believe this is one of the most humble
[19:20] churches in the message of the hour I I
[19:22] believe you humble to the word quicker
[19:24] than any congregation I know of and I I
[19:27] just want to be uh just put Flyers where
[19:29] Flyers are do brother Ericson's the most
[19:31] humble Pastor I think I've ever been
[19:32] around I I just have to put it right
[19:34] there we we love Brother Ray and his
[19:37] spirit is it's unbelievable anywhere I
[19:39] go in the world and I say I'm at brother
[19:41] Ericson's I I'm associate with him there
[19:43] they're like oh brother Ericson his he's
[19:45] got the best spirit so so we're we we
[19:48] want that to be real clear as we
[19:50] continue and now I want want you to see
[19:52] that now that that the prophet is going
[19:54] to teach us amen that humility must be
[19:58] we must humble ourselves or God will
[20:00] humble us amen so because see the point
[20:03] being is God is going to use you and God
[20:07] has chosen you and you're a tool in the
[20:09] hand of God but God can only use you as
[20:12] long as your spirit will allow you to be
[20:14] used of the Lord now in Greater witness
[20:17] brother bam says like this you've got to
[20:19] become nothing in your own sight and you
[20:22] be and then you become something in
[20:24] God's side amen now doors and door to
[20:27] the heart he says now watch when a real
[20:30] big man makes him s small that shows the
[20:34] god of Heaven see Jesus even himself
[20:36] became a foot waser to mankind see the
[20:40] way up he that humbles himself has got
[20:42] to be exalted amen now the prophet will
[20:45] say now see the difference somebody
[20:47] wants their name something big but God's
[20:49] people wants to shun that kind of stuff
[20:52] they don't want big great big things
[20:54] they don't want big something they want
[20:55] to be humble with humility the Way Up Is
[20:58] Down he humbles himself shall be exalted
[21:00] he exalts himself shall be abased now
[21:03] don't try to be a big something see try
[21:06] to be a little something but you be what
[21:08] you are now look at what the prophet
[21:10] said but you be what you are now this
[21:12] King in the scripture had to be a king
[21:15] CU God made him a king so he couldn't
[21:17] just go be somebody else but humility
[21:21] was not not being the king humility was
[21:24] a recognizing I'm a king because God
[21:26] made me a king do you see this some
[21:28] times people get it in their mind that
[21:30] you can't do great things or you can't
[21:32] uh preach great places or you can't sing
[21:34] great songs or you can't be a great
[21:36] church to be humble but that's not it at
[21:38] all you got to be who God made you to be
[21:41] and let me promise you this if you
[21:42] humble yourself God will do great things
[21:44] with you he'll do great things with the
[21:46] church amen look look at the grace that
[21:48] he's given here in True Word Tabernacle
[21:51] but we've got to remember where that
[21:53] Grace comes from and that's why we
[21:56] glorify God every time God does
[21:58] something wonderful we put all the
[22:00] praise on Jesus and we put all the glory
[22:02] on God Amen because God is able to now I
[22:06] know God uses men so we might as well we
[22:08] might as well get aside that I somebody
[22:11] was complimenting me the other day in
[22:12] the back back there and I don't know
[22:14] sometimes I don't know I don't know how
[22:16] to accept compliments and I I know
[22:18] brother Ericson shares the same problem
[22:19] if you start bragging on me I'm like oh
[22:21] my goodness let's change the subject
[22:23] could you it makes you feel odd because
[22:26] you know when I was a young preacher
[22:28] somebody come up and say to me and say
[22:29] well brother Wayne man that was a
[22:30] powerful message well see now that
[22:32] you're you don't realize I'm the only
[22:34] one that knows what's what's being put
[22:37] in my mind when I don't know what I'm
[22:39] thinking or something just comes out of
[22:41] nowhere and and and you know so so
[22:44] sometimes you don't realize how much God
[22:47] it really is amen and somebody say to
[22:49] you well thank you for that sermon you
[22:51] know it was a powerful sermon when I was
[22:53] a young guy I I I I I I'd take time and
[22:55] say well it wasn't me I I tell you I
[22:59] just it wasn't me it just came to me and
[23:01] it was you know and I try to explain it
[23:03] and I see the look on their face you
[23:05] know so after a while I just started
[23:06] saying thank
[23:07] you thank you you know it is really not
[23:11] something that you could explain because
[23:14] God is actually using a man he's using a
[23:17] vessel I had to take time and read the
[23:18] scripture amen but I can't put scripture
[23:21] together I can't put the inspiration in
[23:23] that takes God to do that amen so we we
[23:26] can't just say well I'm not going to do
[23:29] what God called me to do because
[23:30] somebody wants me to humble myself but
[23:32] humility is realizing there is a calling
[23:35] there is a gift there is something God
[23:37] has made us to do but it's God that
[23:40] gives the grace to be able to do what
[23:43] we're doing it's nothing good thing that
[23:45] we have done that we could go back and
[23:47] brag or act like we've done something
[23:49] great it's what God is doing now in
[23:51] Jesus Christ in the same brother bam
[23:53] says now we approach the word tonight I
[23:55] want you to bear in mind remember God
[23:57] doesn't have any any stuffed
[23:59] shirts and when you get to that place
[24:01] that you're willing to be nothing then
[24:03] God can make something out of you and so
[24:06] as what we see Jesus he said he come to
[24:08] show what God was and anything that's
[24:11] high and hotty isn't God woo amen that's
[24:15] a prophet anything high and hotty that's
[24:18] not God he said God is low and humble
[24:22] and he said that's what makes him God
[24:24] something that comes low that can go
[24:27] high my goodness amen that's powerful
[24:30] isn't it amen you got to always stay
[24:32] humble if you'll be little in your own
[24:34] sight no matter what God does for you
[24:37] you can see how much humbler you can be
[24:39] more God blesses you just keep getting
[24:41] more humble all the time and he
[24:43] continues to bless you but when you get
[24:45] to a place that you think I've got this
[24:47] and I haven't I and and you haven't got
[24:50] it but you're on your road out right
[24:53] there see you'll lose your influence
[24:55] you'll lose your strength of your
[24:57] testimony he said when women begin to
[24:59] act like the rest of the women there's
[25:01] something wrong you see what he goes
[25:02] immediately see the reason you have what
[25:04] you have is cuz you're humbling to the
[25:06] word you're wearing those dresses you're
[25:08] letting your hair grow you're doing
[25:09] exactly what a prophet said so God's
[25:12] doing something abundant for you but if
[25:13] you ever get to the place well I can
[25:15] just do what I want and I can live what
[25:17] I want act like what I want then then
[25:19] that's when God backs up and says all
[25:21] right well have at it then amen but you
[25:24] recognize we need the grace of God we
[25:26] need the power of God in our lives we
[25:29] need the sanction of the Holy Ghost upon
[25:31] our meetings Upon Our Lives there's
[25:34] never a sermon amen the longer we preach
[25:37] the more we understand without God
[25:39] sanctions the word amen we can do more
[25:41] damage in one meeting than God can fix
[25:44] in 10 meetings but if God comes in on
[25:47] the word he'll fix problems and he'll
[25:49] fix this and he'll heal this and he'll
[25:51] do that amen and you never have to ask
[25:54] when I get involved because it always
[25:55] comes out in a
[25:57] problem amen do you see God is in
[25:59] Simplicity the Way Up Is Down humble
[26:02] yourself don't never say well I got this
[26:05] he says you ain't got nothing just
[26:07] remember if you got the grace of God
[26:09] just be thankful for it and be humble
[26:12] and keep humbling yourself you see it's
[26:15] not you you got to get yourself out of
[26:17] the picture another quote you got to
[26:19] stay with the promise but you've got to
[26:21] get simple enough to get out of your own
[26:23] way problem with us we can't get simple
[26:26] enough the problem with we can't get
[26:29] simple enough that God you see the
[26:31] secret of the power of God is to get out
[26:34] of the way and let the Holy Ghost do
[26:36] something wonderful in our life God is
[26:39] great and he says and he that humbles
[26:41] himself and hides himself he said Jesus
[26:44] thank God Amen that he could do this I
[26:46] thank thee that thou has hid thyself
[26:48] from the wise and prudent and revealed
[26:50] it unto babes see the way to know God is
[26:53] to get simple to get weigh down and
[26:55] that's the reason See's setting right
[26:56] here tonight your humility has brought
[26:59] you under the message of the hour
[27:01] because you possess the the humility to
[27:04] humble yourself to a prophet to humble
[27:07] yourself to the word of God and that
[27:09] that word itself can become the
[27:12] exaltation of your life amen now listen
[27:15] after after brother Adam will say this
[27:17] and humble thyself he'll say this after
[27:19] all these years on the field and around
[27:22] the world seeing different people I
[27:24] ought to know a little bit about the
[27:26] gate to enter in at and and if you want
[27:28] to get somewhere with God don't you ever
[27:31] let an arrogant Spirit get around
[27:34] you if you want to get somewhere with
[27:37] God don't you ever let an arrogant
[27:39] Spirit get around you y'all know what
[27:41] arrogance is that's like you can do
[27:43] something yourself or you got a little
[27:45] something and you're a little better and
[27:46] someone else it's an arrogance I I I
[27:49] just have to be honest one of the most
[27:50] putrifying thing I've ever saw as a
[27:52] preacher that's arrogant amen is exactly
[27:55] opposite of what a preacher ought to be
[27:58] the preacher ought to know above
[27:59] everybody in the building that I am
[28:01] nothing I come from nowhere I can do
[28:04] nothing I can act no way I can do
[28:06] nothing at all to help anybody I am
[28:09] totally surrendered asking the god of
[28:11] Grace to come in the meeting and to
[28:13] touch a heart and if somebody gets help
[28:15] it was only God that did it I have
[28:17] nothing to offer I have nothing I can
[28:19] brag of but if Jesus Christ the son of
[28:22] God can get me out of the way just long
[28:25] enough he'll minister to a hard and
[28:27] Light lives will be changed and hearts
[28:29] will be touched amen what good would we
[28:32] be to have an arrogance about us
[28:34] arrogance is the very thing that runs
[28:36] the power of God away from a Ministry or
[28:39] a life amen I've seen some pretty good
[28:41] preachers but they're so proud of
[28:42] themselves that you can't hardly stand
[28:44] and listen to and preach the spirit is
[28:46] just arrogant it's just nasty it's
[28:49] putrifying it's an arrogant Spirit you
[28:52] said brother Wayne why would you say
[28:53] that because they actually might be
[28:54] called of God but if they're not willing
[28:56] to Humble themselves God's going to
[28:58] Humble them brother Bram said it's see
[29:01] you got to be conscious you got to be
[29:03] conscious of how little you are you got
[29:05] to be conscious of that you've got to
[29:07] know that you are little brother B said
[29:09] take a glass of water stick your finger
[29:11] in it and pull it out and that's how
[29:13] much your opinion means that's how much
[29:16] it means you see the littleness that we
[29:18] are amen we are little amen and we are
[29:21] alive and he is in humility and as long
[29:24] as we stay humble we are going to dwell
[29:26] with the most high God if we can bow our
[29:29] hearts then God can allow us to see what
[29:33] this scripture is dealing with is
[29:34] humility this scripture is dealing with
[29:37] a king can be took from the lofty
[29:40] position of a throne and be made an
[29:43] animal in the woods because of the wrong
[29:46] kind of spirit you can take the wrong
[29:48] kind of spirit and it will take you from
[29:51] a throne to a four for to a creature on
[29:55] his for all fourest out in the
[29:57] wilderness can you can you imagine amen
[29:59] one day sitting at a king's table
[30:01] commanding armies and thousands and the
[30:04] next day amen they nobody will listen to
[30:07] you there's nobody uh uh coming to you
[30:10] they didn't even clip the poor man's
[30:11] fingernails they didn't cut his hair he
[30:14] was a total lunatic in the space amen of
[30:17] one word that he spoke when he began to
[30:21] say look at this Mighty Babylon that I
[30:23] have created look at this thing that
[30:25] I've done look at what I have said amen
[30:28] it was a hoty heart it was a arrogance
[30:30] that came to him that brought him to a
[30:33] place amen that he was exalted in Pride
[30:38] and there is a law in the Bible if you
[30:40] come up in Pride you will be
[30:44] abased if he would have went up like he
[30:47] come down then he would have come down
[30:51] like he went
[30:52] up amen do you see now I I wantan to I
[30:55] want to I want to say this I do not
[30:58] believe that this scripture is without
[31:01] purpose I do not believe that God would
[31:03] allow a king to spend seven years on his
[31:06] hands and knees without a purpose I I
[31:08] believe that God had a full intent in
[31:10] this scripture to teach us as
[31:13] individuals lessons that we who have
[31:15] been made Kings amen must remember that
[31:19] character must move with our position
[31:22] amen now notice this in Daniel chapter 4
[31:25] when Daniel is talking to the king amen
[31:27] the Bible the Bible says in the vision
[31:29] that there was a watcher an angel come
[31:30] down from heaven and this Watcher in the
[31:33] 17th verse tells us he said this is the
[31:36] matter of the decree of the Watchers and
[31:38] the demand of the word of the Holy ones
[31:40] to this intent that the living may know
[31:44] that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom
[31:47] of men and give it to this purpose this
[31:51] story has a purpose that we would
[31:54] understand the sovereignty of God this
[31:57] entire chapter was written for the
[31:59] purpose that we would understand that
[32:02] anything that we have God has given it
[32:04] to us that God is Sovereign amen
[32:06] almighty God is Sovereign and he will
[32:08] give to whom whatsoever he desires to
[32:11] give because he is God I think that to
[32:13] today that Nebuchadnezzar should have
[32:15] just remembered that God was God now in
[32:18] this in this interpretation uh of this
[32:21] of this Vision brother mam is clear in
[32:24] the message of there is warning before
[32:26] judgment
[32:28] brother Braham is teaching us amen that
[32:31] God has a nature that he never brings
[32:34] judgment before he brings a warning now
[32:38] the warning that Nebuchadnezzar is
[32:40] receiving is a Vindicated warning it's
[32:43] not a it's not something well maybe
[32:46] something might take place he's
[32:48] literally placing this in Vindication he
[32:51] shows him the dream then Daniel sees a
[32:54] vision just like in Daniel chapter 2 and
[32:57] then Daniel comes and tells the
[32:59] interpretation of it and in the
[33:02] interpretation this is a Vindicated
[33:04] Prophet to Daniel tell or Daniel telling
[33:07] King Nebuchadnezzar what is fing to take
[33:09] place he's not guessing about what's
[33:11] fing to take place he's talking to the
[33:14] king he's saying you are fising to go
[33:16] out here and become a beast in the field
[33:19] amen now look at this because of a
[33:21] Vindicated Prophet giving him a warning
[33:24] this is a warning before judgment now
[33:26] judgment not
[33:28] it's not that it might be coming it's
[33:31] not that what if this happens but he the
[33:34] king should be absolutely sure that
[33:38] Daniel is telling him the truth and when
[33:41] Daniel tells him the truth he tells him
[33:43] he's going you're going to be driven now
[33:45] the seven periods of time that he's
[33:47] going to be out on this all fours a
[33:49] prophet said is seven years he said that
[33:52] now think about this seven years as an
[33:54] animal because of a hearty a hotty heart
[33:58] it was seven years as an animal because
[34:00] of a hotti heart that was all that was
[34:02] wrong with the King he had a hotty
[34:04] heart he commanded amen the god
[34:07] commanded the stump to remain with a
[34:09] band of iron showing that what has been
[34:12] cut down will be restored so God was not
[34:15] intending to destroy Nebuchadnezzar he
[34:18] was intending to Humble Nebuchadnezzar
[34:21] it it amazing that Daniel and his people
[34:24] are in the Kingdom of Babylon for the
[34:27] very same sin of arrogance because their
[34:30] forefathers and kings were worshiping
[34:32] other gods because they thought that God
[34:34] would not bring judgment for this kind
[34:36] of activity amen and there they are in
[34:39] that land and God has made them King and
[34:42] Nebuchadnezzar becomes to a place that
[34:44] he believes that he is above the god of
[34:47] Heaven Daniel's God is just another God
[34:50] but God is intending for this man to
[34:52] know without a shadow of a doubt
[34:54] Nebuchadnezzar is going to know that
[34:56] there is a God in heaven
[34:58] that that God rules and that God gives
[35:00] to whomsoever he desires the sovereignty
[35:03] of God is about to become a revelation
[35:05] Amen to Nebuchadnezzar it's going to
[35:07] take seven years and it's going to take
[35:09] seven years as a beast it didn't have to
[35:11] take seven years y'all know that right
[35:14] it didn't have to take seven years do
[35:16] you know that just before amen
[35:18] Nebuchadnezzar falls into this God uses
[35:21] Daniel to say something to him and the
[35:24] Bible says in the 27th verse amen Daniel
[35:27] talk to the king and he says to him
[35:29] wherefore oh King let my counsel be
[35:32] acceptable unto thee break off thy sins
[35:35] by righteousness and thine iniquities by
[35:37] showing Mercy unto the poor if it be a
[35:40] lengthening of thy Tranquility look at
[35:44] this here is a Vindicated Prophet
[35:46] advising this man saying to him look
[35:49] don't go seven years on all fours just
[35:52] humble yourself a and do good amen break
[35:56] this thing break the sin off of you I I
[35:58] think that this is a powerful thing
[36:00] having read what a prophet said to us
[36:03] about our Spirits humble yourself make
[36:05] yourself small take away the hotess put
[36:08] yourself under your brethren humble
[36:10] yourself to the mighty hand of God you
[36:12] see the advice that a prophet is giving
[36:15] was the same advice that was being given
[36:17] into the scripture if you would only
[36:19] humble yourself and change your ways
[36:22] then God would reverse what is being
[36:25] spoken by a Vindicated prophet
[36:28] my Lord think about that a minute God
[36:30] was given to him now the reason that he
[36:32] didn't accept it is written in D Daniel
[36:35] 5 and verse 19 he says it like this in
[36:37] the 20th verse he says when his heart
[36:40] was lifted up his mind is hardened in
[36:42] Pride and he was disposed from his
[36:44] kingly throne and they took the glory
[36:46] from him so his his heart was lifted up
[36:48] and his mind was hardened in Pride so he
[36:50] was already so prideful that a
[36:52] Vindicated Prophet couldn't speak to him
[36:56] a Vindicated prophet couldn't say save
[36:58] yourself seven years of
[37:01] trouble and just do good break this
[37:05] curse off of your life break it off
[37:07] right now and he wouldn't be able to do
[37:09] it now the reason he couldn't is because
[37:11] he was a great
[37:13] man the reason he couldn't is because he
[37:16] was a great man with a hotty attitude
[37:19] amen now look God gave him a different
[37:22] spirit and showed him that I can exalt
[37:24] and I can abase amen now watch what this
[37:28] what what this King done he took the
[37:30] wrong kind of spirit now you you you're
[37:32] hearing a theme through this entire
[37:34] service tonight is the spirit was wrong
[37:38] now look what it was he was a chosen
[37:42] vessel God had ordained him and gave him
[37:45] everything he had but the spirit was
[37:48] wrong tell me tell me it don't matter
[37:50] what kind of spirit you have I'll show
[37:51] you in the Bible it does matter what
[37:53] kind of spirit you have his Spirit was
[37:55] wrong see he he exalted himself now you
[37:58] say what's so wrong with a man exalting
[38:01] himself but the scripture says in Isaiah
[38:03] chapter 14 that this was the fall of
[38:07] Lucifer himself in the beginning Lucifer
[38:10] was a song leader in heaven he was a
[38:13] worship leader he had the highest
[38:16] position in heaven next to amen next to
[38:20] God Almighty was an arch be a light
[38:23] barrier called Lucifer when you went up
[38:25] into heaven he was the right hand of God
[38:28] are you hearing me he was the right hand
[38:30] up there he was in power he had
[38:32] everything coequal to God except for the
[38:36] spoken word he could not and because of
[38:39] that he could not receive worship but he
[38:41] could not handle amen just being in
[38:44] power without receiving worship he had
[38:46] to have somebody to worship him he
[38:48] couldn't handle all them good things
[38:50] that's being said about God he couldn't
[38:53] handle all those good things are you
[38:55] hearing me yet amen that same little
[38:57] Little Spirit can work right in
[38:58] ministries I've seen it work right in
[39:01] churches among songs and and singers and
[39:04] leaders where they get a little spirit
[39:06] that if you if you really brag on one
[39:08] guy well my goodness the spirit gets all
[39:10] tore up and amen but you know what if we
[39:12] loved one another the way we're supposed
[39:14] to love one another when somebody brags
[39:17] on somebody we would get right on the
[39:19] ball and we' brag on them a little too
[39:22] because let me let me just say something
[39:23] to you if our team is winning I don't
[39:26] care who's in the ball it doesn't matter
[39:29] to me who's up here preaching if they're
[39:31] preaching the message of the hour we
[39:33] ought to be shouting amen we ought to be
[39:35] rejoicing the word of God there
[39:37] shouldn't be that place where if it's
[39:40] not coming from a certain guy or if it's
[39:42] you you see what I'm saying there has to
[39:44] be the spirit of the word amen now now
[39:47] the scriptures I know I know these
[39:49] things can get a little touchy but
[39:51] they're touchy whether we talk about
[39:52] them or not so might as well just talk
[39:54] about them right they're already a
[39:56] little touchy so why not just poke them
[39:58] and tell them it's a devil it's not an
[40:00] odd feeling it's a devil you're not just
[40:02] having a little odd feeling it's the
[40:04] same spirit that was on Lucifer in the
[40:06] beginning that was jealous that God was
[40:08] getting something and he wasn't getting
[40:10] it amen now now the scripture said that
[40:13] Lucifer was the son of the morning and
[40:15] was cut down to the ground and did
[40:17] weaken the Nations for thou has said in
[40:20] thine heart I will send them to Heaven I
[40:22] will exalt my throne above the Throne of
[40:25] God and I will set upon the Mount of the
[40:26] congregation side of the north and I
[40:28] will send above the heights of the
[40:30] clouds and I will be like the most high
[40:33] he's using the word the most high look
[40:35] what Daniel was telling him you got to
[40:37] know he's the most high the word most
[40:39] high is Elon that comes from when
[40:42] Abraham met God remember and God blessed
[40:45] him mdct and he said be blessed of the
[40:47] most high God it's a it's a Hebrew title
[40:51] for God which means the most high God
[40:54] and they called him Elon so our God is
[40:56] Not Just another God of gods he is Elon
[41:00] he's the high God he's the most high God
[41:03] there is no other God besides our God
[41:06] he's not one God among many gods he's
[41:09] not sharing his throne or his authority
[41:12] or his power he is God and he's God
[41:14] alone and he's God over everything and
[41:17] everywhere and everybody and everything
[41:19] was made for our God even the devil was
[41:22] made for God Amen that devil is working
[41:25] out exactly the way God is designed him
[41:27] to work out we needed an adversary and
[41:30] bless that Devil he's a real adversary
[41:32] but I hate that thing and amen and it's
[41:35] a spirit and it don't have no place in
[41:37] the Church of the Living God it's a
[41:40] spirit of jealousy and a spirit of Envy
[41:42] I threaten one time to preach a sermon
[41:44] on brotherly kindness that's uh uh
[41:46] that's a that's sacrificed on the altars
[41:49] of jealousy jealousy will cause you to
[41:51] treat people a way you wouldn't even
[41:53] treat a sinner you wouldn't even treat a
[41:55] sinner the way people sometimes gets
[41:57] treated in the house of God and it ain't
[41:59] nothing but dirty old filthy jealousy
[42:02] amen and it's cruler than the grave and
[42:05] it don't become a son or daughter of God
[42:07] to carry that kind of spirit we ought to
[42:10] love one another we ought to serve one
[42:12] another we ought to help one another we
[42:14] ought to lay down on the ground and let
[42:16] somebody walk over us if it needs to
[42:20] be well glory to God it's Thursday night
[42:24] we ought to be shouting
[42:26] right
[42:31] Mercy I will a sin see it was an
[42:33] exaltation self-exaltation
[42:36] listen if you're not interested in
[42:38] exalting yourself you're interested in
[42:40] accepting what you
[42:43] get it's only when you
[42:45] decide that you're going to do something
[42:48] and everybody else don't agree that's
[42:50] when the trouble
[42:52] comes when Trouble Comes is when one
[42:55] individual decides that I'm going to do
[42:58] this and everybody don't get behind them
[43:02] then then it becomes a self-exaltation
[43:04] it's not it's not God doing it so then
[43:08] it becomes an issue it becomes trouble
[43:10] but if every person holds their position
[43:13] and every person gets in their place now
[43:16] I got a right to say these things I am
[43:19] in a position in this assembly and it's
[43:21] right under that man sitting right
[43:24] there directly under 100 100% under 100%
[43:29] agreement with his decisions with the
[43:31] way he goes I don't have to humble
[43:33] myself to that I could have did
[43:34] something different but I chose to
[43:36] humble myself instead to argue
[43:39] with so if he makes a decision I took my
[43:43] opinion aside and I get under his
[43:47] decision because that is the
[43:49] order that's the way Unity comes it's
[43:53] the way the power of God
[43:54] moves my goodness now you can see why
[43:59] the spirit on Nebuchadnezzar was so
[44:00] wrong because it was the spirit that had
[44:03] been on Lucifer in the beginning that he
[44:05] caused him to exalt himself
[44:08] above the stars of Heaven now let me oh
[44:12] God is this okay now this is the way
[44:15] this goes okay so Brother Ray makes a
[44:17] call or he corrects a situation and you
[44:19] call somebody and you're talking to him
[44:21] and they said well he handled that wrong
[44:24] what he did that individual just exalted
[44:27] Ed himself above the advice of your
[44:30] Godly
[44:32] Pastor he exalted himself now what
[44:35] spirit's doing that because they want
[44:37] you to look at them like they're
[44:40] somebody amen but let me tell you if you
[44:43] sit under them as a pastor a little
[44:44] while you think brother Ray ericsen is
[44:46] an
[44:50] angel see I'm getting
[44:52] older I'm getting older I should be
[44:54] wiser shouldn't I but I've been around a
[44:57] little while I've been around I've been
[45:00] around long enough to know that you can
[45:01] sit and watch a television screen and
[45:03] agree with a preacher but if you sit in
[45:05] his church you wouldn't feel the same
[45:09] way long as they're somewhere off
[45:12] somewhere do you see but when it but
[45:14] when they stand in the pull pit and they
[45:15] look at your house and correct you and
[45:17] your family and then all a sudden it
[45:19] ain't is
[45:21] fun I don't know where that's coming
[45:23] from Lord forgive me brother Ray forgive
[45:25] me
[45:28] Mercy help somebody B play
[45:34] something see that's what denomination
[45:36] has tried to do now what I've showed you
[45:38] as a spirit look at denomination what
[45:40] they're doing with a message yeah
[45:43] they're saying brother Bram was wrong on
[45:44] that do you see what they're doing
[45:47] they're exalting their opinion above a
[45:50] Vindicated prophet of God now I can show
[45:53] it to you in scripture if you like the
[45:55] Scripture it says in second Thessalon
[45:57] chapter 2 let no man deceive you by any
[45:59] means the day shall not come except
[46:01] there come a falling away and the man of
[46:02] sin will reveal the son of predition who
[46:05] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[46:09] that is called God or that is worshiped
[46:12] so that as God Seth in the temple God
[46:14] showing himself that he is God who
[46:17] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[46:19] that is called God how many knows what
[46:21] that scripture means brother Bram broke
[46:23] it down for us and I'm not going to take
[46:24] a long time to read it but brother BR
[46:25] broke it down for us who exalteth
[46:27] himself above all that's called God he
[46:30] said what is called God in the beginning
[46:33] was the word and the Word was with God
[46:35] and the Word was God so brother B said
[46:37] what is called God is the Vindicated
[46:40] word in your age which is the message of
[46:42] the hour so that message is here and
[46:44] when a denomination says brother Brandon
[46:47] was wrong on that or when they said do
[46:48] you see what they're doing they're
[46:50] exalting their opinion about how you
[46:52] should live how you should dress how you
[46:54] should teach and they're doing it above
[46:57] all that is called God it's a
[46:59] denominational spirit it's a
[47:00] denominational attitude and it was back
[47:03] there on that King in the beginning and
[47:05] God was saying I can't use you with that
[47:07] kind of spirit on you because you
[47:09] believe that you're greater than I am
[47:11] see denominations believe they're
[47:13] greater than God they're looking for
[47:15] Revival believe they're worshiping God
[47:17] but at the same time they're actually
[47:19] crucifying the word of God now when when
[47:22] God warns Nebuchadnezzar food Daniel he
[47:26] gives him the opport opportunity of
[47:27] repentance and rather than repent he
[47:29] gets hoty he gets pridey who are you to
[47:32] correct me see that's the attitude now
[47:34] let me let me just ask you has there
[47:37] been similar warnings and similar
[47:40] spirits to correction in the Bible
[47:42] before this time there is Kings in
[47:45] Israel who have been lifted up in Pride
[47:47] now I think one king if you if you go
[47:49] back in in in in second chronicles 25
[47:52] I'll give you a little homework there's
[47:53] a fell whose name is AAS ma ma m a a z i
[47:58] a a 2 Chronicles 25 And1 he was a king
[48:03] who strengthened himself and led his
[48:05] people now the scripture I'll give you
[48:07] the I'll give you the condensed version
[48:09] the scripture teaches what happens with
[48:11] this king is he's actually a king and
[48:13] he's put in position he's a king of
[48:15] Judah but Judah has already been divided
[48:18] in Judah and Israel and he's a king and
[48:20] Judah and he's got to fight a battle so
[48:23] he hires himself a bunch of missionaries
[48:25] from Israel and when he hires these
[48:27] missionaries the man of God comes to him
[48:29] and said God's not going to support this
[48:32] when you go in the battle with these
[48:33] with these with these people that you've
[48:35] hired mercenaries not missionaries these
[48:37] mercenaries you've hired he said when
[48:39] you go out into the battle God is not
[48:42] going to help you in this battle and God
[48:44] is able to help or God's able to oppose
[48:47] he said well what do I do with them he
[48:48] said I've already paid him 100 talents
[48:51] he said God is able to give you much
[48:52] more than 100 talents let them go back
[48:54] where they come from and go fight the
[48:56] battle with God so he goes and he fires
[48:59] this bunch of mercenaries amen and he
[49:02] goes on by himself with his little army
[49:04] and he just Stomps this enemy he kills
[49:07] and destroys and takes captive he has a
[49:10] mighty success well while he's being
[49:13] successful in the battle The Mercenaries
[49:15] are going back through Judah and they
[49:17] actually pillage a few cities and and
[49:19] they show out a little because of their
[49:21] anger at the king amen and this King now
[49:24] is built up in himself I whip the enemy
[49:27] so he turns and thinks that he can whip
[49:30] Israel now think about this he's the
[49:33] king of Judah he's of their own blood
[49:35] and he's angry and he sends a letter
[49:37] down to the king of Israel and says to
[49:40] him I think you and I need to meet face
[49:42] to face what an attitude amen you and I
[49:46] need to meet face to face I'm a little
[49:48] angry about what you did and we need to
[49:49] meet face to face he's already puffed up
[49:51] in his heart you see he's he's he he he
[49:54] beat this guy he can beat anybody he can
[49:57] do anything now cuz he did this he can
[49:59] he can just take any battle he can do
[50:01] anything you see the kind of spirit he's
[50:03] presenting well when the king of Israel
[50:05] gots the letter he sends him back a
[50:07] little a little funny letter kind of and
[50:09] he said there was a there was a a a
[50:11] cedar down in the land of Leb Lebanon
[50:14] and there was a thistle sent word to him
[50:17] and then a beast run over the thistle so
[50:19] he was telling him king of Judah you are
[50:21] a Thistle and I am a cedar in Lebanon
[50:24] you are too little to take on the battle
[50:27] you're about to take on and sure enough
[50:28] the fellow was so lifted up in his heart
[50:30] he went on and done it anyhow he just
[50:32] come and attacked and when he did amen
[50:34] the people were killed and they were run
[50:36] back into Judah and the story simply
[50:39] goes that the people whom that king led
[50:42] turned on him and killed him because of
[50:45] the attitude he had got their people
[50:47] killed they turned on their own King and
[50:49] destroyed him now y'all want to know who
[50:51] that was that was uzziah's father and
[50:55] the Bible tells us that Uzziah then
[50:57] becomes king he destroyed the people
[50:59] that K his his father amen and he become
[51:02] king and ruled as a good King he was an
[51:05] impressive man he wasn't politic he'
[51:07] done great for years but at the end of
[51:09] his Reign he was such a successful King
[51:12] he had such a powerful Reign that he
[51:15] believed amen I'm successful I'm blessed
[51:18] I'm going to be a minister now I'm going
[51:20] to go in the house of God and I'm going
[51:21] to burn incense and I'm gonna he thought
[51:24] because he was successful in one
[51:26] position he would be successful whatever
[51:28] he done wherever he went he'd become a
[51:30] hotti man that was the very sin of his
[51:32] own father and when the sin come upon
[51:35] him he goes in the house of the Lord and
[51:37] begins to burn the incense and while
[51:39] he's burning the incense 80 preachers
[51:42] come in there four score of them come in
[51:44] and they say to him you can't do this
[51:47] you're a king you're not a levite you
[51:49] can't do this in the house of God you
[51:51] got to get out and the scripture tells
[51:53] us he man with 80 preachers telling that
[51:56] King he should have humbled himself
[51:58] right there said you know right boys you
[52:00] know what I I got I got a little lifted
[52:02] up you're right never never mind I I I
[52:04] I'll just I I I see I did wrong here
[52:07] I'll just get out of here but you know
[52:08] what that wasn't what he did because he
[52:10] didn't have the right Spirit he was a
[52:12] king but he didn't have the right Spirit
[52:14] and the spirit on him Was the Same
[52:16] Spirit that had lifted itself up in the
[52:18] beginning and the moment he was
[52:20] corrected he became angry at the
[52:23] correction you've got to watch that
[52:25] church Amen in this generation we're
[52:28] living again nobody wants corrected
[52:30] nobody wants to receive correction a
[52:32] pastor can give a little correction
[52:34] people just fly off a handle they they
[52:36] get all tore up in their spirits but the
[52:38] Bible said that this is the house of
[52:41] judgment that correction begins at the
[52:44] house of God if we can't be corrected by
[52:47] the word where can we receive correction
[52:50] where can God correct us if he can't
[52:53] correct us from the pull pit but we
[52:55] might as well go ahead and say it but we
[52:56] got a bunch of mansy pansy preachers now
[52:59] that they're wearing coats instead
[53:01] of preachers coats and they bended to
[53:03] the will of the people so if somebody
[53:05] actually hears a sermon with a little
[53:08] teeth in it they think they're being
[53:09] mistreated they're not being mistreated
[53:12] but the Bible said if we can't receive
[53:14] correction we are bastard born and we
[53:17] don't even belong to God can think about
[53:20] it what would you think about a father
[53:22] or mother never correct its own child
[53:24] you can't tell me you don't love a that
[53:25] you love a c a child and you won't
[53:27] correct it you can't tell me that I'm
[53:29] sorry how how in the world could you
[53:31] love a child and not correct it because
[53:34] if you really correct it you don't want
[53:35] to see it grow up and become a a
[53:37] juvenile and out in prisons and and and
[53:40] and the amen uh we we've got a brother
[53:42] Tyler's here is is one of our one of our
[53:45] police officers bless their heart they
[53:46] can't even hardly do their job now
[53:48] because parents ain't done their jobs at
[53:51] home so they meet a 18yearold out on the
[53:54] street that's entitled they don't have
[53:56] it they don't have to listen to nobody
[53:57] they don't have to do nothing and they
[53:59] have to put them in a police car and the
[54:01] whole public turns on them because
[54:03] they're having to do at 18y Old what
[54:05] some mom or daddy should have done at
[54:07] threey old and should have picked up a
[54:09] switch and whipped that child till it
[54:11] listened like it ought to you said
[54:13] preacher you lost your mind no I think
[54:15] it's time Amen to stop the the nonsense
[54:19] in the house of God and pull back the
[54:21] word of God and let it lay where it lays
[54:25] C black black and white white I'm tired
[54:27] of the gray brush over every situation
[54:30] over every life listen to me there is a
[54:33] right and there is a wrong and I don't
[54:35] care who you are from me to the back
[54:37] door to the back pew to
[54:42] the well maybe I should wait a little
[54:44] while longer before I preach some
[54:47] more said preacher what are you talking
[54:49] about I'm talking about genuine
[54:53] love I'm talking about genuine love
[54:56] when you love somebody enough to be
[54:59] honest and
[55:00] truthful and not want to see their soul
[55:02] in hell not want to see their life
[55:04] destroyed or their marriages or their
[55:06] church or that Spirit of hotess will not
[55:09] receive correction which is exactly what
[55:12] king Uzziah he was a king but he had the
[55:14] wrong
[55:15] spirit and that Spirit caused a
[55:18] leprosy because he wouldn't be
[55:22] able to be corrected he got a big head
[55:25] that's what happened and his head got
[55:27] big now listen the king got to the place
[55:31] that he thought within himself see pride
[55:34] got
[55:35] him people don't think Pride's a big
[55:38] thing but Pride was what brought the
[55:40] fall of multiple kings in the Bible
[55:44] Pride amen what got them was
[55:47] Pride now if there was those who could
[55:51] not be corrected if those were had the
[55:53] wrong Spirit then surely in this Bible
[55:55] somewhere
[55:56] there was somebody that represented a
[55:58] bride who did receive
[56:01] correction that does receive the word of
[56:03] the Lord and changes things do you see
[56:06] what happens in Daniel 34 Daniel 4:34
[56:09] the Bible tells us that because he
[56:11] wouldn't receive correction he fell
[56:13] seven years as a beast but there was
[56:15] something that finally ended his seven
[56:17] years of trouble his seven years was
[56:20] ended and and and have y have y'all ever
[56:21] noticed this it's the first time I
[56:23] really paid attention to this this is
[56:25] the only place in the Bible I know that
[56:27] a pagan King has written scripture in
[56:29] the
[56:30] Bible these are the words of a pagan
[56:33] King in our Bible he said I
[56:36] Nebuchadnezzar remember that's powerful
[56:38] Nebuchadnezzar lifted up his eyes unto
[56:39] heaven and he said my understanding
[56:42] return to me and I bless the most high
[56:44] here is a man blessing the god whom he
[56:48] has destroyed the people who worshiped
[56:50] that God he should not have ever
[56:53] worshiped Daniel's God or Israel's God
[56:55] because he would have believed believe
[56:56] that their God wasn't able to deliver
[56:58] but he come through enough to know that
[57:01] Israel God is God he come through enough
[57:04] to understand the God Amen is God this
[57:07] man's God is God and and when he saw
[57:09] that he lifted up his eyes I thought it
[57:12] was powerful I believe today that if we
[57:14] could lift up our eyes it would break a
[57:16] lot of problems I believe if we would
[57:18] lift up our eyes from the troubles in
[57:20] our lives and the situations that's
[57:22] going around us sometimes those problems
[57:24] are in your life to hum
[57:26] you sometimes you're facing situations
[57:30] in your homes and in your marriages
[57:32] because you wouldn't receive correction
[57:34] to begin with and you've been living
[57:36] with that thing for years but you could
[57:38] break the thing tonight if you would
[57:40] only lift up your eyes and say God I've
[57:42] had enough of this thing I've had enough
[57:45] of this situation and we've been around
[57:47] and around and you know I'm preaching
[57:48] tonight you know you know you know I'm
[57:50] telling you the truth some of us has
[57:52] been dealing with things in our homes
[57:54] for years when the word corrected it but
[57:57] we wasn't ready to receive correction so
[57:59] we've been dealing with it and dealing
[58:00] with it but there is a way to end the
[58:03] thing there's a way to change the
[58:05] situation and it is to lift up your eyes
[58:08] and say God you're God and there is no
[58:11] there is no waken it without you you see
[58:13] what is happening amen you see what is
[58:15] taking place now in the message of
[58:18] warning then judgment brother Bron will
[58:20] actually read from Isaiah chapter 38
[58:22] this is his text in Isaiah chapter 38
[58:25] and he reads the story of a man named
[58:28] Hezekiah when Isaiah goes to Hezekiah
[58:32] y'all remember who Hezekiah was Heen he
[58:34] was a man who had a bull brother B said
[58:36] he wasn't dying from Bulls he must have
[58:37] had
[58:39] cancer he said the man had cancer
[58:41] Hezekiah never knew that but he said
[58:42] Hezekiah had cancer he said and God was
[58:45] going to Hezekiah amen through Isaiah a
[58:48] Vindicated prophet and remember remember
[58:50] when Isaiah walks in the room and
[58:52] Hezekiah knows a prophets talking to him
[58:54] now his words cannot fall
[58:56] he knows that this man when he speaks it
[58:58] is exactly what he says is the truth and
[59:01] he says to the man prepare yourself
[59:03] because God's going to take you from the
[59:05] earth you're going to die a Vindicated
[59:08] Prophet has just announced you're going
[59:10] to die brother when a prophet says
[59:12] you're going to die you might as well
[59:13] prepare your life you're going to die
[59:16] this man so believed the prophet that he
[59:20] dropped down and turned his face to the
[59:23] wall he didn't get angry he didn't get
[59:25] upset he took it as a warning rather
[59:28] than a rebuke he took it as a warning
[59:30] rather than being angry at a rebuke he
[59:33] received it as a warning and Grew From
[59:35] it look what he done he turned his face
[59:37] to the wall and Isaiah left the room and
[59:40] the Bible records before Isaiah could
[59:42] get out of the temple he was out on the
[59:44] steps I think it was as he was passing
[59:46] and the spirit of the Lord spoke to him
[59:48] and said turn around and go back in
[59:50] there and tell Hezekiah that his prayer
[59:53] has reached under heaven and that he
[59:55] shall not die
[59:56] but thus saith the Lord I give him 15
[59:59] more years myy Lord 15 more years given
[1:00:03] to him he can you think about that amen
[1:00:06] a prophet thus sayith the Lord you're
[1:00:07] going to die amen the Bible records that
[1:00:09] Hezekiah honestly didn't want to believe
[1:00:11] him because he'd already prophesied his
[1:00:14] death but he said I'll give a sign unto
[1:00:16] you he said Here's your sign I want you
[1:00:19] to go out on the temple steps and out on
[1:00:21] the steps there's a su dial out there
[1:00:24] that's of course that's how people used
[1:00:25] to tell time we still do it if you don't
[1:00:27] have a clock in the fields you got a
[1:00:28] compass you can set it down stick a
[1:00:30] stick up the shadow as it falls over the
[1:00:33] compass will tell you what time of the
[1:00:34] day it is amen do you see they had a
[1:00:36] Sund dial that told them the time of the
[1:00:38] day and the Bible says that I have
[1:00:41] turned back the dial on the Sund dial 10
[1:00:45] degrees now it was enough Seth that most
[1:00:48] people wouldn't have recognized it it
[1:00:50] was enough that most people wouldn't
[1:00:51] even understood it ever happened but
[1:00:53] because a prophet was announcing it it
[1:00:56] was a visible thing a minute thing but
[1:00:59] it was visible and when they went and
[1:01:01] checked it sure enough the sundow had
[1:01:03] backed up exactly 10 degrees now I I I
[1:01:07] uh I Enlisted the help of a of one of
[1:01:10] our one of our Geniuses here brother
[1:01:12] Richard called text him last night
[1:01:14] brother Richard grills and he done a
[1:01:16] little math degree for me amen he said
[1:01:18] brother Wayne he said now if it's a
[1:01:19] sundow as all other sunds he said that's
[1:01:22] exactly 40 minutes I thought oh dear God
[1:01:26] exactly 40 minutes the number of
[1:01:29] judgment is
[1:01:31] 40 God backed up the hand of time
[1:01:36] exactly 40 minutes he took the Judgment
[1:01:38] off of it because he heard the warning
[1:01:42] of a Vindicated Prophet amen what do you
[1:01:45] think we're talking about tonight church
[1:01:47] if we receive a spirit that can receive
[1:01:50] a Vindicated message we have passed from
[1:01:52] Death unto life and we shall not come
[1:01:55] into condemnation judgment has been
[1:01:58] passed over the church by the words of a
[1:02:01] Vindicated Prophet we never come into
[1:02:04] judgment but God backed up the very
[1:02:07] hands of time now y'all y'all y'all
[1:02:09] y'all think it's I think it's power for
[1:02:11] 40 minutes but listen to this in the
[1:02:13] same context is another man whose name
[1:02:16] is Jonah who went to preach to a city
[1:02:19] the size of Los Angeles and he went to
[1:02:22] announce the destruction he told him in
[1:02:24] 40 days God is going to destroy this
[1:02:27] place and you know what they did instead
[1:02:29] of instead of being rebuked instead of
[1:02:32] being angry the king called a fast they
[1:02:35] put sackcloth and Ashes on and they
[1:02:37] begin to repent before the almighty God
[1:02:40] Amen and God stayed the hand of judgment
[1:02:43] and took those 40 days away from them
[1:02:45] that had been judgment by repentance
[1:02:48] they had backed up the clock of God and
[1:02:50] had brought back a mercy on a nation
[1:02:54] where judgment had already been
[1:02:56] pronounced I don't care what kind of
[1:02:57] judgment you're under tonight if you
[1:02:59] would hear the word of the Lord it will
[1:03:02] back up the hands of judgment amen
[1:03:04] accept the warning of God say Lord I
[1:03:06] don't want no kind of spirit that's
[1:03:08] wrong I don't want no hotess I don't
[1:03:10] want a pride in my life Lord back it off
[1:03:13] of you don't have to Humble me Lord I'll
[1:03:14] humble
[1:03:15] myself look at what they did they amen
[1:03:18] they backed that up can I I tell you
[1:03:21] it's a powerful thing because what gets
[1:03:23] men in trouble sin what gets families in
[1:03:25] trouble is sin amen listen to me it's
[1:03:28] not that you're not exalted the Bible
[1:03:30] said if you'll humble yourself I will
[1:03:32] exalt you in due time do you know this
[1:03:35] is the time for the Church of the Living
[1:03:37] God this is exactly the time for you to
[1:03:40] be exalted listen to me the God who is
[1:03:42] God has spoke over your life and he said
[1:03:45] you are the final voice to a final Age
[1:03:48] The God Who is God said whatsoever you
[1:03:51] bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:03:54] the God who is God God has said you're
[1:03:57] ambassadors and you're spiritual Kings
[1:04:00] and you have a dominion and everything
[1:04:02] is under your feet every disease and
[1:04:05] every devil everything has been placed
[1:04:08] you have been positioned as a king and
[1:04:11] Authority by almighty God then we must
[1:04:15] keep the spirit that goes along with our
[1:04:20] position oh think about it a
[1:04:23] minute you know the scripture says that
[1:04:26] he that overcometh this layout to see an
[1:04:28] age he said he will give to him to share
[1:04:30] in his
[1:04:31] throne th this is this is the age his
[1:04:34] Dominion you can share in Dominion with
[1:04:37] God you said brother Wayne what are you
[1:04:38] talking about in his kingdom amen there
[1:04:40] is no greater voice than this bride in
[1:04:43] the Kingdom of almighty God you have a
[1:04:46] joint Heir in every promise according to
[1:04:49] the word you know the Bible said in Mark
[1:04:51] 11 if you say under this mountain be
[1:04:54] moved and cast the SE it shall be as you
[1:04:57] have spoken you cannot give that kind of
[1:05:00] power to a people who don't have the
[1:05:02] right kind of character that's why the
[1:05:05] age of the spoken word is the age of
[1:05:07] adoption and adoption directly deals
[1:05:10] with the character that's in the Church
[1:05:12] of the Living God we have got to have a
[1:05:14] character that is responsible with the
[1:05:17] power that has been placed into our hand
[1:05:20] I tell you tonight I know this character
[1:05:22] amen without character power it makes us
[1:05:25] fit to rule but if you take power and
[1:05:28] you take character and you put them
[1:05:30] together you have a church that's fit to
[1:05:32] rule you have a church that's fit for
[1:05:35] power my goodness I think tonight I
[1:05:39] think we ought to shake off the bands I
[1:05:41] think we ought to shake off every Spirit
[1:05:43] that's unlike the Lord every spirit that
[1:05:46] would say well I don't have to listen to
[1:05:47] the message or I don't have to accept
[1:05:49] that or I don't have to believe that we
[1:05:51] ought to let every one of them go until
[1:05:53] our spirits come to such a spirit of
[1:05:56] humility amen that the that whatever
[1:05:59] judgments have been piling
[1:06:01] up it will be gone we got a couple more
[1:06:03] minutes is this okay amen Apostle Peter
[1:06:06] said this if any man speak then let him
[1:06:08] speak as the Oracles of God and if any
[1:06:11] man Minister let him do it as the
[1:06:13] ability which God giveth that God in all
[1:06:15] things might be glorified through Jesus
[1:06:17] Christ to him praise and Dominion
[1:06:20] forever and ever amen If any man speak
[1:06:22] let him speak as an oracle of God
[1:06:25] another words let him be the voice of
[1:06:27] God if a man's going to speak let him
[1:06:29] speak the word of God listen to me
[1:06:31] friends I don't know if you know the
[1:06:33] position that God has given you you are
[1:06:36] right now Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:38] you're right now Kings seated in
[1:06:42] Authority with almighty God but we can't
[1:06:45] do just what we want to do it has to be
[1:06:47] in line with the word of
[1:06:51] God brother Wayne is an oracle brother
[1:06:53] Bram said we must live by the word
[1:06:55] because the Bride is a part of the
[1:06:56] bridegroom and like the wife is a part
[1:06:59] of her husband therefore we must be that
[1:07:00] word
[1:07:01] bride and what is that word bride the
[1:07:04] manifestation of the hour the bride not
[1:07:07] a Creed or denomination but a living
[1:07:10] Oracle of God a living attribute
[1:07:13] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:07:14] of God in the formation of the Bride
[1:07:16] that's to be expressed in the hour we're
[1:07:17] now living in a living Oracle of God let
[1:07:22] him speak but let him speak as a living
[1:07:24] Oracle as a living Oracle see not with
[1:07:28] his own
[1:07:30] ability now think about this tonight not
[1:07:32] with your own ability friend not with my
[1:07:35] ability the ability don't come from us
[1:07:37] it has to come from God everything you
[1:07:40] have has come from God you don't have
[1:07:42] one thing tonight that you didn't get
[1:07:44] from
[1:07:45] God look look at the scripture and the
[1:07:47] exposition of the church ages brother BM
[1:07:49] said each individual that the group
[1:07:51] isn't the one who has an ability to hear
[1:07:54] from God Amen to hear what the spirit is
[1:07:57] saying by the way of a messenger those
[1:08:00] who are hearing are not getting their
[1:08:01] own private Revelation nor is a group
[1:08:03] getting a corrective Revelation but each
[1:08:06] person is hearing and receiving what a
[1:08:08] messenger has all already received from
[1:08:12] God do you see what he's saying look how
[1:08:14] easy would it be that because of the
[1:08:16] position we have to start saying little
[1:08:19] things to our own opinions start putting
[1:08:22] things out into decree to whatever we
[1:08:24] think they are to be or how they are how
[1:08:27] how they should lay but our ability must
[1:08:29] come from God if we don't stay with a
[1:08:32] message it becomes a hotty attitude that
[1:08:35] what we say
[1:08:37] matters do you see what he is it's
[1:08:39] coming from an ability God have not come
[1:08:42] to bring us fear he said I've come to
[1:08:44] not bring fear and failure but love and
[1:08:47] courage and ability and all power is
[1:08:50] given unto me and it is yours to use
[1:08:54] just speak the word word and I will
[1:08:56] perform it God has come to give an
[1:08:59] ability to the church that ability is a
[1:09:02] message and that you could hear it
[1:09:04] you've got to be a prophetic class of
[1:09:06] people you can't just be anybody and
[1:09:08] receive this this ability has come from
[1:09:11] God the Revelation has come from God and
[1:09:14] if you have a revelation it's not a
[1:09:16] place where we look down on others and
[1:09:17] say oh they they're this and they're
[1:09:19] that there ought to be a humble heart
[1:09:21] coming and saying God help them Lord
[1:09:23] help somebody that don't see this
[1:09:25] because what we have has come from God
[1:09:29] listen
[1:09:29] tonight the prophet of God said I don't
[1:09:32] have very much now this is a this is a
[1:09:35] prophet I don't have any ability I have
[1:09:37] no personality I have nothing but I've
[1:09:40] got a soul and I got a voice and it's
[1:09:43] all yours
[1:09:46] Lord in perfect strength brother Bram
[1:09:49] said we got to get empty
[1:09:51] friends we got to get
[1:09:54] weak
[1:09:57] deny your own
[1:10:00] ability you out on the radio out there
[1:10:03] you that hear these
[1:10:04] tapes now I stopped right there when he
[1:10:07] said that I was listening to it you that
[1:10:10] hear these
[1:10:11] tapes whenever they come empty yourself
[1:10:14] out pour yourself out upon the altars of
[1:10:17] sacrifice and let the angel come with
[1:10:20] fire and fill the vessel with the power
[1:10:22] of the almighty he'll make you strong
[1:10:26] now Moses himself before God could use
[1:10:29] him brother Braham said he had lost all
[1:10:33] of his ability that's when God made him
[1:10:38] powerful now here's the thing if you
[1:10:42] actually have an ability brother Bram
[1:10:45] said you've actually got to strip
[1:10:48] yourself unless you would try to do
[1:10:51] something within
[1:10:53] yourself now this this this right here
[1:10:56] this set me back in my seat no ability I
[1:11:00] don't care whose it is will never be
[1:11:03] usable in the sight of God God has got
[1:11:07] to get all of our abilities out of us
[1:11:10] before he can achieve his
[1:11:12] purpose if he's got something for us to
[1:11:16] do as long as we feel that we're doing a
[1:11:19] pretty good job of it then we'll never
[1:11:22] be able to be used of God
[1:11:29] you said brother Wayne my ability
[1:11:30] brother Bram says you've got to dig out
[1:11:33] the rubbish of your own ability and
[1:11:37] throw it out of us and make room for the
[1:11:40] Holy
[1:11:41] Ghost my you say brother Wayne what what
[1:11:44] is it it it takes the right Spirit to
[1:11:47] master your own ability it'll take the
[1:11:50] spirit of God to master it you see
[1:11:53] sometimes our only ability is our
[1:11:56] greatest
[1:11:57] struggle and that was Moses's
[1:12:00] problem he was going to take his ability
[1:12:03] and he was going to deliver the children
[1:12:04] of God by it and God cured him back
[1:12:07] there 40 years on the desert brother
[1:12:10] Bram said his cure come to him he said
[1:12:13] his cure was he had to get him away from
[1:12:17] his human ability listen friend tonight
[1:12:21] what we've read in the scripture here is
[1:12:23] simply a king
[1:12:26] who got caught up in his own
[1:12:29] ability he got drunk on his own power
[1:12:34] and he decided that he could do whatever
[1:12:36] he wanted whenever he wanted because he
[1:12:39] was God but there remained to be a God
[1:12:44] and he had to go through seven
[1:12:48] years to discover that God is God he
[1:12:52] could
[1:12:53] have in one moment said to Daniel you
[1:12:57] know what Daniel you're right tell you
[1:13:00] what let me do you instruct me and we'll
[1:13:04] do exactly what you're saying and let's
[1:13:07] walk away from this clean tonight listen
[1:13:10] friend tonight I promise you this there
[1:13:12] is examples in the scripture where
[1:13:15] people took the wrong Spirit towards the
[1:13:18] word proudy and hoty can our musicians
[1:13:21] come brother
[1:13:22] Ben they took the wrong
[1:13:27] attitude they end up
[1:13:29] dispossessed some of them end up out of
[1:13:31] their own homes some of them end up in
[1:13:34] the wrong places I can show you at the
[1:13:36] Third Exodus go read the Third
[1:13:38] Exodus and see the prophet said they
[1:13:40] were coming out of Egypt going back to
[1:13:42] Israel he said why were they in Egypt to
[1:13:44] begin with he said because God had made
[1:13:46] Joseph the leader and they had rejected
[1:13:48] it they' rejected the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:51] because of their Spirit they had to go
[1:13:53] somewhere else and do something
[1:13:54] different
[1:13:55] you got to be careful tonight that your
[1:13:58] spirit will accept the grace of God and
[1:14:02] that you let your let your let your
[1:14:05] spirit let it receive the word now
[1:14:09] especially to you to this congregation I
[1:14:11] don't mean this as a rebuke I really do
[1:14:14] not mean this as a rebuke but it is a
[1:14:18] lesson and I believe it's a lesson to
[1:14:20] all of us right I believe it's a lesson
[1:14:23] to any believer
[1:14:25] because this age is an
[1:14:27] age I I'm not going to take time in
[1:14:29] scripture to prove it to you
[1:14:32] tonight but when this Bible said we've
[1:14:35] been lifted up into Heavenly
[1:14:37] places do y'all realize that's not
[1:14:40] fulfilled until this
[1:14:43] age in Matthew the 20th chapter a woman
[1:14:47] looked at Jesus and said let my son said
[1:14:49] it's your left hand and your right
[1:14:51] hand position and Jesus said I can
[1:14:55] cannot do it for it is not mine to give
[1:14:58] but it will be given unto them that my
[1:15:00] father had prepared do you know that the
[1:15:02] prophet said that was the Overcomer of
[1:15:04] leysa you have been elevated to a
[1:15:07] position in the
[1:15:09] word that no other age has ever come
[1:15:14] to so especially in this
[1:15:18] hour we have to watch that our
[1:15:21] Spirits keep up with our position
[1:15:25] God help us tonight I don't know about
[1:15:29] you but that's what I want I want I want
[1:15:32] all of my
[1:15:33] abilities I want God to rule in this
[1:15:36] life I want every every Spirit every
[1:15:40] feeling I know I know I've been in
[1:15:42] Ministry 20 years I probably felt every
[1:15:44] feeling I've probably had every Spirit

[1:15:49] situations the same feelings of jealousy
[1:15:51] and envy and pride and and you you you
