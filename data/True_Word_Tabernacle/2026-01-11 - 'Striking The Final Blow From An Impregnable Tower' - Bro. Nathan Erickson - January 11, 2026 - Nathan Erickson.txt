Want [music] to go to the Lord in prayer. Welcome each one to the service this morning. May God bless you. [music] We're certainly happy to have all our guests here among us. May the Lord bless you for for your efforts and for being with us [music] and the saints of God that have been gathered together this weekend. We're thank the [music] Lord for what he has done among us. Amen. We give him all the praise for that. We brother Josh and [music] sister Megan Collins want to thank the Lord. Little baby Dawson is in [music] church for the first time today. They say, "We want to thank the Lord publicly and express our appreciation for our pastor and his wife, our church family, and all that have prayed for Megan and Dawson over the last several months. [music] We have countless testimonies we could share, but to name a few. When Megan was first admitted to the hospital, she had gone in the night before she was transferred to Dayton, [music] but we were sent home. She ended up going back in that following morning because she felt something wasn't right. And when she arrived to labor and delivery, the nurse and doctors [music] couldn't believe she was sent home the night before. The nurse pulled her lab results that were [music] from the previous night, and her words were, "You were easily at stroke conditions." [music] They transferred to Dayton that day and told us she'd be in the hospital until she delivered, whenever that would be. But the team of doctors [music] wanted to do all we could to get to get her to 34 weeks for Dawson's lung development. She was in the hospital on preeacclampsia [music] protocol for 6 days before she started having vision changes, severe headaches, [music] and some other concerning symptoms. When they rechecked her lab, she was entering beginning stages of [music] organ failure. So at 32 weeks, they immediately transferred us to labor and delivery to begin induction. We were very concerned because they [music] told us Dawson would be in NICU at the minimum of his due date, which was Christmas Eve. Once Dawson was born, they had told us that his blood sugars would be extremely unstable and he would need help controlling them. [music] They stopped checking his blood sugar after less than 24 hours because they [music] were perfect every time. They told us he would be on CPAP or be intubated for a minimum of a month because [music] of baby lungs just don't develop sooner than that if be if born before 34 weeks. [music] He came completely off a CPAP 12 days after being born and never required intubation. When we began bottle feeding, Megan was learning how to do his feeds. And the nurse that day told her, "Now, don't be afraid or worried when when [music] he spits or chokes. It will happen, and it's very normal." Megan told her, "Well, I've heard that if I just don't want to see him deal with that. [music] I I I've heard that, but I just don't want to see him deal with that, so I'm believing he won't." The nurse started his first [music] bottle feed and after he drank the first ounce with no choking or spits, she gave Dawson to Megan and let her complete the feeding. When Dawson finished the [music] entire bottle, the nurse looked at Megan with the most confused look on her face. Her words were, "This makes no sense. I've worked in a NICU for 12 years and I've never seen a baby with the first bottle feed not choke." The doctors came in for rounds. And his doctor that morning didn't believe the nurse when she gave report. He looked at Megan and said, "I just can't believe how well he [music] did. This is not the normal for a 32- week baby." Megan said, "Sir, our baby is one of the most prayed for [music] babies in the world right now. You may be surprised, but I'm not." Dawson was born [music] October 31st. They told us we would spend Christmas in NICU, but we were [music] home 8 days before Thanksgiving. Thank you to all that sent money, gift cards, [music] flowers, texts, and calls, but most importantly, your love and prayers. We love you all and are so happy to have our whole family here [music] today for the first time. Josh, Megan, Riley, Ellie, and Dawson. Praise the Lord for that. We thank God. [applause] Amen. [applause] Praise the Lord. [applause] Thank God [music] for his keeping power. Amen. &gt;&gt; When there seemth not to be a way, he makes a way. &gt;&gt; Are y'all happy about that? &gt;&gt; Are y'all happy about that? &gt;&gt; Amen. If the brothers will come, but we're receiving the missions offering this morning. [music] Brother Joel Strike says, "I just want to share something that the Lord answered my prayer last week. I almost wrote a prayer request last week that [music] the rain would not hinder my job because I work in construction and we are exposed [music] to the elements. Last week the forecast looked like we would only get 3 days of work, but praise God, he made a way for me to get six [music] days of work. Hallelujah. He cares about everything that we are concerned about and he is always making a way for us. [music] Thank the Lord. I have a request here. I know some are out sick this morning. And so let's remember those that are unable [music] to be here. Sister Mary Lewis would appreciate prayer for two [music] pressure sores that are in a different area than before. Pray they heal quickly. [music] So let's remember Sister Mary Lewis in prayer. Brother Troy, would you come lead us to the Lord? Let's our hearts. our gracious heavenly father. Lord, we just want to give you praise and glory and honor for this this morning the opportunity that we'd have to come together, Lord, once again, Lord, and just to worship you, Lord, and to and to exalt your name, Lord, above all other names, Lord, we're just so thankful for your grace and your mercy in our lives. And Lord, as we [music] Lord see these needs Lord Lord many times Lord in our humanity Lord we'd like to just put our hands on them Lord and and maybe Lord Lord but we recognize that we have no ability of our own Father there's nothing that we could do Father and and Lord recently Lord I just been thinking of that scripture Father Lord [music] as the uh word Lord come to the prophet Zechariah Lord and he would begin to cry that not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth [music] the Lord and and Lord that's what we're depending on this morning, Lord, is that great Holy Spirit to come, Lord, and do the impossible, Lord. And Lord, it was your spirit, Lord, that brought little [music] Dawson, Lord, through that, Lord, delivery and the the early stages, Father. And Lord, it's your spirit that comes time and time again, Lord, and [music] and ministers to the needs just as we saw last night and even Friday, Lord, it's your spirit, Father. Lord, and we're just trusting, Lord, in you this morning for each of these needs, Lord. And [music] and Lord, I know that you're not done, Lord, this weekend, Lord. I know that this morning there's still needs, Lord. And Lord, we're expecting you, Father, to meet each one, Lord. Lord, we've gathered, Lord, together, Lord, to Lord, to just to pull on your word this morning, Lord, and to draw, Father, from from you, Lord. Lord, I'm just so thankful, Father, for Lord, the grace that you've given, Lord, and the the [music] price that you've paid, Lord, that we could, Lord, be a free people, Father. Lord, and and Lord, [music] that we know that you're willing and able, Lord, for each of these needs, Lord. our sister Mary Lewis, Father, the the [music] source there, Lord. I just pray, Father, that you would just minister, Father, Lord, to her. And Lord, that you would just, Lord, just give her grace, Father. May you just show her mercy, Lord, [music] and Lord, all the needs, Lord Jesus. We just pray, Father, that you would just, Lord, just take control, Lord, of every situation, Lord. We're just putting our trust in you, Lord. [music] Pray bless the missionary offering, Lord. We just ask that you would just, Lord, just further the work, Lord, our brothers that go from here, [music] Father, to many areas, Lord. Lord, we think of our brother Zachary Wallace this morning, Lord. Lord, may you just anoint him, Father. And we, [music] Lord, and just inspire him, Lord, and just, Lord, may you just, Lord, lead him and guide him, Lord, as he would, Lord, minister, Father, and to spread this message, Lord. May you just be with him, we pray. We just commit all things [music] to you. We commit this service to you. We give it all to you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.

We we thank the Lord for the moving of his spirit and for the support of you. a wonderful people. Amen. We just uh thank God very richly and dearly for you. Amen. The blessing that he has given. Amen. That we'd be able to gather together and his blessing of of coming and uh um we certainly just want to remember Cararissa. She woke up feeling real ill this morning. So y'all remember her in your prayer and uh and trust the Lord to touch her. I haven't seen her uh not be able to go in in several years. So it was she something just struck her. I don't know what it was, but she just uh just like a bug or something. So, but you just remember her in prayer. Amen. Trusting the Lord. But we're um we're so blessed to be here today. And I what a word last night. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um this is him. Amen. I I think of I think of of when John uh sent back to ask of Jesus, is this him or do we seek another? He didn't even answer him. He said, "Just you disciples go sit down over there and you go tell him what you've seen and heard." &gt;&gt; And they went back and said, "Well, the blind see." &gt;&gt; Come on, John Ryan. &gt;&gt; Let John Ryan start testifying. The blind see. &gt;&gt; Amen. The deaf here. Do y'all know that there was an entire deaf school released in Little Rock, Arkansas after William Brandon visited that school? Yes. &gt;&gt; The deaf hear, &gt;&gt; the blind see. &gt;&gt; The walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many remember congressman upshaw and his testimony? &gt;&gt; And only one of thousands of times cripples got up out of chairs and walked. Amen. Because this was more than just a message. &gt;&gt; It was Messiah. &gt;&gt; It was the presence of God fulfilling his scriptures in this age. and every biblical principle has been met &gt;&gt; to be the return and the appearing of the grace of God to this generation. Amen. We so love him this morning. And amen, we uh love these songs and the blessings of God. Amen. We we want you to stand with us this morning. We're going to go to the word of God. Amen. Uh we're we're so happy. Amen. We're so happy uh to see God and and his mercies and and what he's done for us. Amen. And you don't you you might not realize this, but but the Holy Spirit is working all the time in in in homes and lives and in the churches. He's he's just blessing constantly. Every every time you turn around, he's blessing. Um Brother John Guthrie, won't you tell us how God blesses right in just in your home? Well, Carol told me about a I'm going to guess about a month ago she had a a [clears throat] lump on her chest up here by her collar bone. And she said it had been there for about a year and it it started getting bigger about a month or so ago. So we went to praying. She went to the doctor. The doctor said, "That looks pretty bad." And referred her to a dermatologist. And she was supposed to have went to the doctor this past Monday. But the week before that, I'll say about Tuesday or Wednesday, the thing just drained and dissolved and it's gone. &gt;&gt; And I want to give glory TO THE LORD. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; BROTHER JOHN'S BEEN BLESSED with a lot of wonderful testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh you Amen. The presence of God is consistently Amen. touching lives and hearts. Amen. As we turn to the word of God this morning, we're going to invite brother Nathan to come. We ask the Lord to bless him and give him mercy this morning as we pull upon the word of God knowing, amen, that God will meet every need. Amen. As he promised. Amen. Amen, brother Ben. Amen. Jesus. [singing] [music] Jesus. Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. There just [music and singing] something about that name, [singing] [music] [music] master, savior [singing] [music] Jesus. us like a friend. Oh yes, [music] after the rain. [singing] Now, if you have a need this morning, why don't you just call that [music] name Jesus? Jesus. [music] Jesus [music and singing] let all and earth [singing] we welcome you proclaim your [singing and music] king and kingdom shall all [singing] [music] pass away, but there's only [music] about [music] once again. [singing] My Jesus, [music] sweet Jesus, Jesus. [music] Oh, [singing] [music] he's [music and singing] my master. Save Lord [singing] Jesus [music] [singing] like a friend. [music] Earth after the rain. [music] Oh [singing] my Jesus. [music] Jesus. [singing] Jesus. [music] Let [singing] all heaven and [music] earth proclaim [singing] [music] [music and singing] kingom pass away. [music] But there's something about [music and singing] that name. [music] Amen. Sweeter than honey from the honeycomb. Amen. Something about [music] that name Jesus. Uh sure love this church. Sure has [music] been a wonderful time together this weekend. A couple weeks ago, we were [music] uh doing a little study with the youth group kind of historical and biblical on on the love feast they called it that they had in the early church. Uh some of you maybe uh study that in the Bible and how for that early church you read there right in Acts the 2 chapter that they would gather together in their homes and break bread together and that that communal meal that that that fellowship was just as fundamental to their apostolic worship as the preaching and the singing and the because there's just something about sitting down [music] and eating together &gt;&gt; that makes us one. Amen. And you know, you think about natural family. There's Ericson's all over the world, but there's some right right here in this in this area that are extra special to me cuz those are the ones I eat with. Amen. I know there's bride all around the world. But there's something about to me about True Word Tabernacle, this family, these people. Amen. Cuz these are the ones I eat with. And we've been feasting this weekend. God's just giving us a love feast. And I'm looking for a revival of love in the church just as it came down in the service last night to make us more one than we've ever been. Amen. Not only with one another, but with him. Amen. I I sure appreciate uh just the the the opportunity to stand not only this weekend, but in life, shouldertosh shoulder with brother Isaac, brother Ronnie, [music] my brothers in arms, and my friends. And I I I really feel uh like the least uh like we've saved the least for last. But you know, I'm just happy to be here. Amen. Uh and we just appreciate [music] the opportunity to speak to you. Appreciate Brother Wayne for making a place for us. And uh you know, this week, this Thursday actually will be the third anniversary of Brother Wayne being our pastor. And uh what an amazing three years that we've had. [applause] We appreciate brother Wayne. [applause] I would just like to say, Brother Wayne, uh I think I'll speak for the whole [music] church. &gt;&gt; We're not here for the scenery. [laughter] We're not in Lima for the culinary scene or the culture, but Amen. We're we're here, Brother Wayne, because we believe in your ministry. We believe God has anointed you. And it's a revelation to me personally, something God has personally spoken to [music] me that Brother Wayne is the one who's meant to be my pastor to lead my family on to the coming of the Lord. And we appreciate [music] the leadership that we've had. And uh and so it's just an a blessing to be here and to have a part in what the Lord is doing here in Tabernacle. If it's true what Brother Wayne said one time that I [music] could have maybe done other things with my life or been other people, I wouldn't want to. I uh &gt;&gt; I I just believe that God is doing a special work right here in this church and &gt;&gt; I want to be any part of it that I can be. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe in the mission. Amen. I love you all. God bless you. Let's go to the word of God in [music] Judges the 9th chapter this morning. Well, what I have on my heart to do today is just to proclaim the victory &gt;&gt; that has already come and then we'll go home happy. How's that sound? &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this story in the book of Judges. Have maybe referenced it in ministry before. I hope that we could just bring it out today just the way just in the way that I see it because it means so much to me for this hour. Judges chapter 9, we'll start at verse 50. Now, this is uh comes at the end of the story of a king named Aimilec. There's so much you could go into in this story. Uh but Aimilec was a wicked king. He was a slayer of brethren. um he he uh he he slayed all the sons of Gideon and uh proclaimed himself his very name means my father is king. So he was not trying to just be a judge as they had in that time. He was he wanted to be a king, a slayer of the brethren. And so this wicked king, the scripture says, went to the encamped against the took it. But there was a strong tower within the city. And thither fled all the men and women and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and got them up to the top of the tower. And Aimilec came to the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Aimilec's head, and all to break his skull. Then he called hastily unto the young man his armor bearer, and said unto him, "Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me." A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died. Now, if uh I know you've been standing, but if you turn also to 1 Corinthians chapter 15, we'll just read toward the end here at verse 49 of 1 Corinthians 15. Paul says, "And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does corruption inherit incorruption. But behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this in For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. Now when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?" &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize, Amen. that when this body change happens, then shall be brought to pass this saying. Amen. I want to preach this morning uh on striking the final blow from an impregnable tower. Amen. It's kind of an ambitious title. I'm going to need your help to preach today. Amen. Let's let's just pray. Lord Jesus, what a wonderful weekend that we've had together, Lord. We just thank you, Lord. Lord, you're so faithful to come time after time and move amongst us by your spirit. &gt;&gt; All we can say is, Lord, let it not become common to us. Lord, may you always be welcome here in our midst, Father. May there be a place for you in this church to come, Lord, and open up your word, Lord, and let the quickening power, Father, spark it to life amongst us, Lord. We love your appearing. We love your manifestation, Lord. We love your presence. We just ask you would come once more, Father. Lord, I I uh Lord, I I have no ability today, Lord, but in Christ, I can do all things, Father. You give me strength, Lord. And you see my heart, Lord, to to serve these people, Father. Lord, and I see, Lord, what you've laid on my heart. And Lord, just hearing the preaching all this weekend, to see the continuity, Lord, to see, Lord, the the how it dovetales together, Lord. Gives me courage today, Lord. That you want to say something to your people. I pray, Lord, you just help us all to get out of the way. That you could come on the scene and have your way amongst us, Lord, and say what you would want to say. And let us see the picture just right, Father. Lord, you put something in my hand today. I want to strike a blow against the enemy. Help us, Lord, we pray and come amongst us once more in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you as you're seated today. Striking the final blow from an impregnable tower. Amen. You know, we find first of all as we look at this uh as we look at the picture of this story in the book of Judges of a siege of the slaying of a king and amen. uh we want to we want to position ourselves in this story and find ourselves here in the word of God. Amen. And so you firstly we got to we to position ourselves the first thing we got to recognize and maybe I'll take about the first half of this sermon uh to deal with it is that we have a tower today. Amen. The Bible says that the name of the Lord is a strong tower. And I'm so glad friends in a world where everything's falling apart. There's nothing firm. There's nothing that can stand. It seems like everything is shaken. But we have one place, amen, that cannot be affected by the falling part of the world. Amen. A strong tower. It's a place of refuge. It's a place of safety. And I'm so glad that God gave it to us. And that's why, you know, we come and we that's one of the the great reasons why we lift up the name of Jesus Christ, you know, because the higher he's lifted up, the higher we're lifted up because we are placed and positioned and identified in that name. And I love that name of Jesus, you know. Amen. There's there's there's no other name like that name. There's no there's no other identity or identification that means what it means. Amen. That the name of Jesus, Amen, should be lifted up in all the earth there. Amen. Not everybody can recognize it like we can recognize it. But there will come a day when every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Amen. I lift up the name of Jesus today. The name of Jesus is so high cancer can't get over it. Amen. The name of Jesus is so wide that trials of life can't get around it and drag you out of that place of safety. There's nothing that can touch you if you're behind that name of Jesus. The name of Jesus is so deep, Amen. that your deepest fears and your deepest feelings and the most profound and and darkest places that you GO THROUGH, AMEN, CANNOT get under that name of Jesus. Amen. I I lift up that name. YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE AMEN. OUTSIDE OF this name, the whole world is falling apart and everything's coming to nothing. But in Christ, everything is fine. Amen. Everything is wonderful. Everything is peace and everything is joy to be in the name of Jesus. You know, Amen. The only mistake that we could make in this day is to get out from behind that name. Amen. God has opened up a an identification for the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. That we would have a place of safety today. The message is a place of safety. Amen. Brother Brandon would say that Eve, she had a great fortress. Amen. of the word of God. And as long as she stayed behind that fortress, she was safe. She was in paradise. She was in Eden. Amen. The only mistake that Eve made, Brother Bram said, she got out from behind that great fortress of his word. As long as she stayed behind the word, he said everything was fine. And he said, "And we make our mistake when we get out from behind the word." Amen. So, we want to be in that name. We want to be identified in it. Brother Brandham, one of the most quoted things he ever quotes, he says, "Now, how do you get into Christ?" Amen. It's not it's not a you know it's not a 10-step plan. It's not a real complicated process. The Bible said by one spirit we are all baptized into one body. Amen. One Lord, one faith, one family, one name given under heaven WHEREBY MEN MAY BE SAVED. AMEN. AH. AMEN. Behind the name of Jesus. I would like to say today if YOU'RE IN TRUE WORD TABERNACLE AND YOUR IDENTITY today is as a member of True Word Tabernacle, I want to say that we're glad to have you. But I want to warn you today, you're not safe here in True Word Tabernacle. AMEN. OH MY. BUT GOD SENT A MESSAGE AND YOU COULD GO BEYOND THE CHURCH AND GET INTO CHRIST. AMEN. IT'S NOT SAFE HERE, FRIENDS. AMEN. WE DIDN'T LEAVE THE METHODIST CHURCH TO JOIN A MESSAGE ORGANIZATION. WE'RE NOT HERE TO BUILD AN ORGANIZATION. WE'RE NOT HERE TO CREATE A NEW TRADITION. WE'RE NOT HERE TO START A NEW MOVEMENT. AMEN. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, AMEN, PUT A WATCHMAN IN THE TOWER HAS SAID IF YOU, AMEN, ARE TRYING TO FIND YOUR SAFETY IN THE CHURCH THAT YOU BELONG TO AND THE TRADITIONS THAT YOU HOLD DEAR, COME OUT OF HER AND GET INTO CHRIST. AMEN. BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY PLACE OF SAFETY IN THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT A QUESTION OF MEMBERSHIP. IT'S NOT A QUESTION of association. It is a question of identity. And I want to take some time today to deal with the this subject of identification. Amen. Because you know, you realize that brother man would tell us there's only two towers you can try to hide in. One of them is the strong tower, the name of Jesus Christ. And the and all the rest of it is the tower of babel. Amen. And the tower of babel cannot stand, friends. In other words, what man can do will never stand. What man can build, what man can organize, what man can think, what man CAN FIGURE OUT WILL NEVER STAND. AMEN. BUT IF YOU COULD GET OUT FROM UNDER MAN'S ABILITY AND GET OUT OF JUST GET OUT JUST PUT IT OUT OF YOUR MIND THE IDEA OF I CAN OR I MUST OR I WILL. AMEN. AND GET TO THIS TOWER THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. THEN YOU'LL BE SAFE. AMEN. IN A SAFETY LIKE YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. What man can do can never survive the ages. &gt;&gt; But God has provided a place. &gt;&gt; God's chosen place of worship. Amen. I'd like you to read this one with me. Just set the tone today. Brother Bran said, "Church, wherever you are and what you belong to, it makes no difference. But there's one thing you must know. You've got to be in Christ &gt;&gt; or you're dead. &gt;&gt; You can't live outside of him. Your church might be all right as a building. Your fellowship might be all right as man, but when you deny the body, the blood, the word of Jesus Christ, you're dead the minute you do it because that's God's chosen place of worship. There is where his name is exactly. That's where he chose to put his name not in the church but in the son Jesus Christ. Now what we say now now we all have this tendency sometimes or brother man say we say the church the great mighty church she did this and she did that and she's weighed the storms and we've picked up in population. We're we're great in numbers and we're a mighty church and she is a great thing. But brother Brand I'm so glad brother Brand said God never said anything about a she. And he said him, him is the meeting place, the lamb, NOT THE CHURCH, NOT HER NAME, BUT HIS NAME. [laughter] AND HE DIDN'T PUT HER name anywhere. He put his name in him. And that's WHY ALL THAT WE DO in word or deed, we must do it all in the name of JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. THAT'S THE ANSWER, FRIENDS. AMEN. It's not your name, MY NAME, OUR CHURCH, SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHURCH, WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHO WE CAN BE AND WHAT SHE HAS DONE. AMEN. BUT IT'S ALL IN HIM. IN HIM IS OUR SAFETY. AMEN. I KNOW WE'RE LIVING IN A world that puts a lot of pressure on a believer. We all feel the pressure of the age. Amen. Our young people are growing up in a world, amen, that's pressing on them all the time. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM gave us an answer to pressure. And is, Amen. There's a WAY THAT YOU CAN LET OFF THE PRESSURE. AND HIS ANSWER, AMEN, IS TO GET INTO THE NAME OF THE LORD. AMEN. AND IF YOU CAN FIND THAT PLACE OF SAFETY, AMEN. IT IS THE ANSWER TO PRESSURE. I KNOW WE feel pressure today. Amen. Because of our high calling. Amen. We feel pressure today because we know we are to be the bride OF JESUS CHRIST. AS WE HEARD LAST NIGHT, you know, uh uh brother brother Arie dealt with this so so adeptly. AMEN. THAT WHEN YOU BEGIN to preach the bride's position and that the son of man ministry is in her AND THAT CHRIST, AMEN, has come in the formation of the bride today. Amen. And there are mighty works that we are to do and a mighty people that WE ARE TO BE. IT BEGINS TO PUT A PRESSURE IF YOU DON'T SEE IT RIGHT. BUT YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND, EVEN THOUGH SHE WILL DO THE GREATER WORKS, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS TO BE HIM, EVEN THOUGH SHE, AMEN, IS TO IS TO MANIFEST HIS ATTRIBUTES, IT STILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER. IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT THE MESSAGE CAME TO DO, TO PULL US OUT OF OUR OF OUR ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY AND IDENTIFY US WITH JESUS CHRIST FOR THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT LETS OFF THE PRESSURE WHEN YOU'RE identified in Christ. I'll tell you what to overcome today. How many How many want to be an overcomer? &gt;&gt; Listen, if this word identification doesn't mean anything to you, Amen. I tell you this is absolutely crucial to be an overcomer today. I I dare say you will not overcome Leodysa. Amen. Without a revelation of your identification. &gt;&gt; Can I rattle off some quotes today? &gt;&gt; Israel and the church. Brother Ram said, "If you're justified in Christ, you are glorified in Christ already &gt;&gt; as far as God's concerned." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect." How could you ever BE PERFECT? &gt;&gt; HOW? COME ON, CHURCH. HOW COULD YOU EVER BE PERFECT? &gt;&gt; BUT IN THE SIGHT OF CHRIST TONIGHT, EVERY BORNAGAIN CHRISTIAN IS PERFECT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAID, "I'M JUST IN AS PERFECT IN GOD AS CHRIST WAS, and you are too. EVERY OTHER BELIEVER. FOR IT'S NOT MY HOLINESS, IT'S HIS HOLINESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD CANNOT ACCEPT MINE. I have none. But I come in Christ by faith and by Christ I'm in him &gt;&gt; and I'm perfect in the sight of God. In the message law of grace, brother Ben said, "Now it isn't what I can do. It isn't whether I'm good or not. It's whether he was good. I can never BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE IT." HOW MANY? SOMEBODY ACCEPT THAT TODAY. I CAN NEVER be good enough to make it. Amen. But but listen, HE SAID YOU CAN'T be good enough to make it. IF YOU EVER MAKE IT, AMEN. YOU'LL STAND IN THE merits of Jesus Christ. Amen. In the innervale, brother Bam said, "Most people that profess Christianity have such a hard, struggling time to hold on." How many ever felt like you were struggling to hold on? I know that I have. Brother Bram said, he said, "It's it's because," Amen. He said, "It's because of a lack of correct teaching. I want to get taught today." How many like to learn a lesson from the prophet of God? Brother Brham said, "I'm going about to teach you." Amen. Uh uh uh why you feel like you're struggling to hold on. Brother, here's the correct teaching. BROTHER BRAM SAID, "THERE'S NO SUCH A THING AS HOLDING ON." He did the holding on. THE WHOLE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE IS BASED UPON REST. THOSE WHO HE HAS CALLED, HE HAS JUSTIFIED. THOSE WHO HE HAS JUSTIFIED, HE HAS ALREADY GLORIFIED. AMEN. IT IS NOTHING THAT YOU DO OR WHAT YOU CAN DO. IT'S WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU IN CHRIST, [applause] &gt;&gt; brother Nathan. BUT I GOT A TRACK RECORD. I'VE GOT A MEMORY. I'VE GOT AN ACCUSER. THERE'S THINGS THAT I'VE DONE. AMEN. I'M A SINNER. BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "HOW CAN YOU BE A SINNER WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SINLESS ONE? &gt;&gt; And God can only see him who you are in." Amen. Rising the sun. Brother man said, "Don't say I hope TO MAKE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT." &gt;&gt; I tell you, we could just dismiss and go HOME RIGHT NOW. I'VE ALREADY MADE IT. &gt;&gt; I'VE ALREADY MADE IT. IT'S ALREADY DONE. &gt;&gt; Not I will make it. I've already made it. I never made it, but he made it for me. &gt;&gt; Church, if your security is in your performance, &gt;&gt; Amen. You're only as good as your worst day. &gt;&gt; If your security is what you can do or what you know, Amen. You're only as strong as your weakest moment. Amen. But you got to know your identification today. You got to learn to hide in this tower. Amen. GET INTO THIS IDENTIFICATION. GET INTO THIS MESSAGE AND MAKE IT YOUR IDENTITY AND BE A BELIEVER OF IT. AMEN. and realize it's who you are. AMEN. ACCEPT THE VINDICATION OF IT AND GET INTO THIS TOWER. AND ONCE YOU GET INTO THIS TOWER, DON'T REACH YOUR HAND OUT. AMEN. AND TRY TO DO SOME WORKS. AMEN. Or the devil WILL CUT THAT HAND OFF. AMEN. DON'T STICK YOUR HEAD OUT. AMEN. AND TRY TO KNOW SOMETHING. AMEN. OR YOU'LL LOSE THAT HEAD. AMEN. JUST GET ALL THE WAY BEHIND WHAT CHRIST HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU. AMEN. JUST GET UNDER THE FINISHED WORK OF CALVARY. AMEN. JUST GET UNDER A VINDICATED WORD AND BE SAFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S ALL WE GOT to do today, friends. Amen. You see, if your again, if your security is in your performance, you're only as strong as your own strength. But if you got a positive confession abiding in Christ, Amen. If the profession of your life is not what you can do, but what Christ did for you. Amen. I'll tell you what, you are as indestructible as the word is in indestructible. You are as infallible as the word is infallible. I know where I'm standing. [laughter] Amen. You you YOU YOU'RE AS POWERFUL AS THE WORD IS POWERFUL. AMEN. Because then you're in Christ. AND THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE TODAY, FRIENDS. BROTHER ISAAC STARTED THIS MEETING. AMEN. WITH GREATER is he that is in me than he that is in the world. John 14 WILL TELL YOU, AMEN. THAT IF HE'S IN YOU, THAT MEANS YOU'RE in him. [laughter] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'LL BE IN ME AND I'LL BE IN YOU. AMEN. AND WE'LL BE A STRONG TOWER AGAINST THE ENEMY. WHEN THE ENEMY COMES IN LIKE A FLOOD, I'LL LIFT UP A STANDARD. CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF GLORY, &gt;&gt; a place of safety, a place of protection. &gt;&gt; Safe in what the word says about me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, I know I'm in an unredeemed body, but I'm also in Christ. &gt;&gt; So, how holy am I? &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if I'm in Christ, I'm just as holy as he is holy. I'M JUST AS RIGHTEOUS as he is righteous. I'M JUST AS ABLE AS HE is able. I HAVE GOT JUST AS MUCH POWER AS HE'S GOT POWER. I'M JUST AS PERFECT AS HE IS PERFECT. AMEN. BECAUSE MY IDENTITY IS NOT IN ME, BUT IT'S IN HIM. HALLELUJAH. I'M IN CHRIST TODAY. I'M SAFE. THAT'S YOUNG PEOPLE. WHEN THE ENEMY COMES TO ACCUSE YOU, THAT'S WHERE YOUR SAFETY IS. YOU'LL NEVER PROVE TO THE ENEMY WHAT A PERFECT LIFE THAT YOU CAN LIVE. AMEN. BUT A POSITIVE CONFESSION WILL SAY, "BUT I BUT YES, BUT I'M IDENTIFIED IN CHRIST. HE SHED HIS BLOOD FOR ME. I WAS THERE ON CALVARY. I WAS THERE." AMEN. WHEN HE WENT TO THE GRAVE. BUT GLORY TO GOD, I WAS THERE WHEN HE ROSE UP OUT OF IT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'M ALIVE IN CHRIST. I'M DEAD TO MY SINS. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm safe &gt;&gt; because he lives. I live also. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Nathan, can I sin away my grace? Send away my day. Not if you're Mrs. Grace. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Come on. When you realize your identity, you're going to get real Calvinistic. Amen. And when you realize who you are, friends, that's what this message did for you. What this message did, it killed off all of your all of your systematic Amen. identification, all of your systematic Christianity. It married you to Jesus Christ. YOU'RE NOT A CHURCH ANYMORE. You're a bride. And what and and and listen, IT'S VERY SPECIAL TO be the bride of Christ in this day because a marriage comes with a name change. AMEN. YOU SEE, THERE HAS TO be a change of name to have a marriage. If you show up to my house with a box of rattlesnakes and say, "I got a box of rattlesnakes here for Cheyenne Hyatt and and she ordered them and and you know, she paid the price uh uh many years ago to to get these rattlesnakes and now I'm showing up. I'm going to give it to her." I'll tell you what we my wife would say. Cheyenne Hyatt don't live here. THERE IS NO MRS. HYATT IN THIS HOUSE. AMEN. NO, THIS IS MRS. ERICSON'S HOUSE. AND FRIENDS, THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE WE THINK THAT WE GOT TO ACCEPT SOMETHING FROM THE DEVIL. AMEN. UNDER THE IDENTIFICATION OF WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS. BUT YOU DON'T CUZ IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE. YOU'VE HAD A NAME CHANGE. YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR WHAT THE DEVIL'S TRYING to deliver. You do not have to accept it. Yeah, we could talk about my faults. We could take out I could preach a 40-part series on mistakes that I have made. But listen, that Nathan Ericson died many years ago. I AM CRUCIFIED IN CHRIST. NEVERTHELESS, I LIVE. [laughter] AMEN. NOT I, BUT CHRIST LIVETH IN ME. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and he gave himself for me. He became sin. Amen. But that's only half of it. I &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S WHAT GREAT IS THE MYSTERY of godliness. People have wrote papers. Amen. People have uh built their thesis. People have argued for 2,000 years about every little nuance of of of the uh of the condescension of Jesus Christ, of God becoming flesh. And it MYSTIFIES PEOPLE. AMEN. THE IDEA OF HE COULD BECOME SIN. WHAT A GREAT MYSTERY THAT IS. BUT THAT'S ONLY HALF THE MYSTERY. I WANT TO TELL YOU FRIENDS, NOT ONLY DID HE BECOME MY SIN, BUT I BECAME HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN. I'M UNDER A DIFFERENT IDENTIFICATION. AMEN. I'M AS RIGHTEOUS AS HE IS RIGHTEOUS. &gt;&gt; PURE AS HE IS PURE. I'm him because I'm his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My faith, my reception of the word of God today vindicates to me who I am. &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. To the world, you might be a sinner. I think young people, this is a refrigerator quote. But to God, you're not because you're in Christ. How can you be a sinner when you're in the sinless one? And God only sees him who you are in. Friends, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. I want you to see your position today. Amen. The theme of the meeting has been has been recognizing who you are. Recognizing your position, recognizing. [laughter] And look, friends, I I just want to I I want to put my little piece in today to let you know you're not just saved. You're safe. Amen. There's a lot of people that ARE SAVED, THEY JUST DON'T know that they're safe. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SECURE YOU are as the bride OF JESUS CHRIST. I WANT FEAR TO DIE TODAY. AMEN. I WANT I WANT CONDEMNATION TO PASS OFF OF SOME LIVES. AMEN. I I I WANT THE BRIDE TO BE ABLE TO REJOICE IN WHO SHE IS AND WHERE SHE STANDS. THAT'S WHERE my heart is. Friends, you got to see your position now. Amen. In this story, Amen. That little woman is sitting there on top of a tower. Amen. Besieged. Yeah. See, she her life wasn't at peace. SHE WAS IN A BATTLE. AMEN. There was an enemy that was besieging her. Had had had had had encircled her. And on every hand is an enemy that's throwing his fiery darts and and trying to burn her down. Amen. trying to hurl his stones and trying to trying TO TRYING TO BREACH THE tower of safety that she's in. Amen. So, it's not a time OF PEACE. A AND FRIENDS, you know, uh there'll be peace in the millennium, but there won't be any peace till we get out of here. Amen. I know you're in a battle. I know I'm in a battle. Amen. BUT WHEN YOU REALIZE YOUR POSITION in the battle, AMEN. THAT YOU'RE NOT OUT HERE IN A FIELD SOMEWHERE LEFT TO JUST FEND FOR YOURSELF. AMEN. AND TRUST IN YOUR OWN SELF-DEFENSE. BUT YOU'RE IN A TOWER. THERE'S A STRONG PLACE. HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "BROTHER NATHAN, what am I in the bride age or in I AM I IN LEADYA?" DEPENDS ON YOUR IDENTIFICATION CUZ THIS KING ALREADY CAME AND BURNED DOWN THE WHOLE TOWN. BUT WITHIN THAT TOWN, THERE WAS A TOWER. HALLELUJAH. I'M NOT A LAY OUT OF SIN. AMEN. I'M NOT WRETCHED. I'M NOT MISERABLE. I'M NOT BLIND. I'M NOT NAKED. I'M NOT UNPROTECTED. I AM UNDER A DIFFERENT IDENTIFICATION. &gt;&gt; YEAH. I'm under siege, but I'm operating today from a position of peace and security. I'm in a good place. I don't know what you're going through today. You might be in the middle of You might have come to these meetings in the middle of the greatest storm of your life, but I want you to know by the word of God today, you're in a good place. &gt;&gt; Just turn your neighbor down. Say, "I'm in a good place." Amen. I'm in A GOOD PLACE. I'M SAFE WHERE I'm at. Amen. I'm covered where I'm at. I don't have to worry where I'm at. I'm in a good place. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed. We are perplexed, but we're not in despair. We're persecuted, but we're not forsaken. We're cast down, BUT WE'RE NOT DESTROYED cuz we're bearing about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's something about a siege. You know, siege sieges go on a long time. They don't usually end in a pitch battle. It's usually a long process. And there's a lot of psychological warfare happens in a siege. And that's what that's why the greatest battle ever fought. Amen. Is not out here, but it's up here. Amen. Because you've got an enemy at your gates. And he has surrounded your tower of identification today. And he wants to do anything he can to get you to take one step out from that fortress. Just one step just TO GET YOU TO DOUBT THE WORD OF GOD AND GET OUT from behind your place of protection. Amen. And so he's always trying to convince you that you're not as safe as you think you are. HE'S ALWAYS JUST TRYING TO PUT A LITTLE SEED IN YOUR MIND AND MAKE YOU JUST DOUBT. HEY MAN, THINK WHAT? You're going to run out of thing. You know, you're going to run out eventually. YOU'VE HELD ME OFF THIS FAR, but I'm going to keep throwing my darts. One of these days you're going to crack. One of these days you're going to make the last mistake. And one of these days I'm going to get you in a snare for THE FINAL TIME. GOD'S GOING TO THROW YOU OUT. THEN YOU'LL BE MINE. THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL COMES. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. BUT AS WE HEARD THIS WEEKEND, AMEN. THE ONLY REASON HE'S TALKING so much, AMEN, IS CUZ HE CAN'T TOUCH YOU. ALL HE CAN DO IS TALK AT YOU. AMEN. BUT HE CAN'T GET THROUGH THAT DOOR, CUZ THE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS LAID DOWN. AMEN. IN THIS DAY, AMEN. to be our protection against the enemy. &gt;&gt; He's trying to demoralize you, friends. I'll tell you what. But you know what? You think, "Oh, it's so rough to be besieged. you know, oh, the enemy is all around me and I can't go do the things I want to do and I can't just, you know, go enjoy the things I want to enjoy and I can't go here and eat there and I can't oh, I can't wear this and wear Oh, it's terrible to be besieged. Amen. But it ain't a picnic to be the besieger either. Cuz what the enemy does, he comes and he gets around your tower. Oh, yeah. And he runs through all your crops and eats all your food and and kills all your animals and and raids all your treasure and Amen. and he just runs rampant all through the city and takes everything that you have. Amen. But after a while, he runs out. And after a while, you know, he he starts throwing rocks and and and and and spears and darts at your tower. BUT AFTER A WHILE, HE STARTS RUNNING out of arrows. Amen. AND YOU KNOW, AFTER A WHILE, HUNGER BEGINS TO SET IN TO THE SIEGE CAMP. THAT'S WHEN THINGS GET DESPERATE. AMEN. THAT'S WHEN HE REALLY STARTS TALKING. THAT'S WHEN HE REALLY STARTS PLAYING MIND GAMES. AMEN. WHEN HE'S JUST AT THE POINT OF LOSING THE BATTLE. WHEN HE'S TRIED EVERYTHING HE COULD TRY AND YOU'RE STILL STANDING. AMEN. WHEN HE'S BROUGHT YOU AMEN. WHEN HE'S JUST THROWN EVERYTHING HE HAD AT YOU AND IT JUST BOUNCED OFF AND HE COULDN'T PIERCE THROUGH YOUR VEIL OF IDENTIFICATION. That's when the devil gets desperate, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know what? I'll tell you what. Amen. That you say, is it better to be the besieger or the besieged? Depends on the resources. Depends on who's going to run out of food first. Depends on who's going to run out of water first. Hallelujah, friends. But in THIS FORTRESS, WE'VE GOT AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY. AMEN. LISTEN, THERE IS NO FEAR OF THE MESSAGE RUNNING OUT OF REVIVAL. AMEN. HERE AT TRUEWARD TABERNACLE, WE DON'T HAVE TO GET WORRIED THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO COOL OFF AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF POWER. AMEN. OH MY. PEOPLE ARE COMING AND THINGS ARE CHANGING AND THINGS WON'T BE THE SAME. CHRIST WILL BE THE SAME. ON CHRIST, THE SOLID ROCK WE STAND. NO MATTER WHAT TODAY BRINGS OR TOMORROW BRINGS, WE HAVE A FOUNTAIN THAT'LL NEVER RUN DRY. IF YOU'RE A LITTLE COLD THIS WEEKEND, AMEN. THE A FOUNTAIN HAS SPRUNG UP IN THESE MEETINGS. UH ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GO GET ANOTHER DRINK. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DRINK IT DRY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT. THE BREAD OF LIFE IS SERVED day after day &gt;&gt; in an inexhaustible supply. &gt;&gt; See, we're in a battle, but we're not on rations. And if there's one thing I hate, if there's one thing I hate is WHEN THERE'S A WHOLE TABLE FULL OF GOOD food to eat and somebody say, "Well, don't eat all of it. We'll save some for tomorrow."

I THINK I'LL GO AHEAD AND BE HAPPY NOW. I'LL BE IN REVIVAL NOW. I'LL BE ON FIRE NOW. AMEN. AND IF MY FLAME BURNS A LITTLE LOW, THERE'S ENOUGH OIL IN A STOCKPILE. I AIN'T FIXING TO RUN OUT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. We're not on rations. You're not going to run out of revival. Just go back to the well. Listen, I want you to see, brother, brother, what this message done and and uh it's been preached. So be the the wonderful thing is I don't have to take an hour to try to teach it. It's been preached all weekend. But but spoken word is the original seed. Brother Anna will tell you, amen, that your spiritual womb has been sealed against denominational seed. In other words, you're already at a place where the word has come into your into your heart of faith and it's been sealed off and it's sealed against anything the devil would try to put in there. That's how secure you are. I'm trying to tell you, you're in a fortress that is impregnable. You know what that word means? It means it cannot be Amen. It cannot it cannot crumble. Amen. It cannot be accessed by the enemy. AMEN. THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE ENEMY can get in there AND DRAG YOU OUT. IT IS AN IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS. THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. IS NOT IS NOT RESTING ON A HOPE SO. SHE'S NOT RESTING ON A MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT. AMEN. SHE'S RESTING, AMEN. ON THE ETERNAL WORD OF GOD. AMEN. WHICH WORD SHE IS. AMEN. LOOK, BROTHER WOULD SAY, HE WOULD SPEAK. HE WOULD TEACH ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT THE SEALING OF THE WOMB AND how you're an impregnable bride and amen. AND AND HOW GOD HAS PUT HIS SEED word in you. And then he'll just come to this and he'll say, look, he said, when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing, there is nothing in the world going to defeat you in it. &gt;&gt; That's all. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY UNDEFEABLE. &gt;&gt; NOT YOU, BUT GOD THAT IS IN YOU. DO YOU BELIEVE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR? &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LET'S LET'S MAKE IT OUR CONFESSION TODAY. I AM ABSOLUTELY UNDEFEABLE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME. IT'S CHRIST THAT'S IN ME. AMEN. I CANNOT LOSE. I CANNOT AMEN. I CANNOT PERISH. I CANNOT FAIL. AMEN. THIS CHILD WILL BE BROUGHT FORTH. [applause] &gt;&gt; How am I GOING TO DO IT? HOW AM I GOING TO DO IT? DON'T WORRY, MARY. THE HOLY Ghost is going to OVERSHADOW YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN A RAPTURE. The Holy Ghost, AMEN, IS GOING TO PUT you in a rapture. AMEN. BECAUSE THE THE VERY coming of the Lord, how many know, is the coming of the promised son. That's the type. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I just I'm a little all over the place. But I remember one time I remember one time uh we were expecting uh Rowan, our first our first baby. And I we had a little moment, you know, that new parents do or prospective parents. Cheyenne was so sick. And it was just a rough day. And there she is just kind of curled up around the toilet. And I'm sitting on the floor with my arms around her, you know, trying to trying to relate, but I couldn't. [laughter] And she said, "OH, I JUST WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS BABY." I said, "Well, here's the [laughter] thing. It's too late. It's too late, church." Amen. And that's the message of the devil today. It's too late. Amen. To stop a rapture, it's too late. Amen. To stop the bride of Jesus Christ. A word seed has already been planted. A womb has been sealed. The pro Amen. The process of life is in motion. Amen. SHE'S GOING TO BRING FORTH THE COMING OF THE LORD. YOU CAN'T STOP IT. YOU MIGHT WISH IT. AMEN. SHE MIGHT HAVE SICK DAYS. SHE MIGHT HAVE BAD DAYS. SHE MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLES. AMEN. BUT THE SON OF GOD IS COMING FORTH FROM HER SPIRITUAL WOMB. AMEN. FRIENDS, WE CAN'T LOSE. WE CANNOT BE DEFEATED. THE LAW OF LIFE IS IN EFFECT. WE'RE AN IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS. AND THE ONLY BATTLE THAT WE'RE FIGHTING NOW, BROTHER RAM SAID, IS A SHOWDOWN. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS GOD IS PROVING TO THE DEVIL THAT THIS BRIDE IS NOT LIKE EVE. YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT, BUT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO UNBELIE DISBELIEVE THE WORD. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE FORTRESS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE. DON'T BELIEVE THAT DEVIL. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; She's not like Eve cuz she's not that kind of a woman. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, THE name of the Lord is a strong tower. That's why we don't have to be afraid of missing the rapture today. &gt;&gt; Look, friends. Amen. If you if you if you're afraid of missing the rapture, you start listening to the message a little more. &gt;&gt; Why don't you listen to the very the very scripture brother Brandon used to preach the rapture &gt;&gt; in the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; HE SHALL HIDE ME IN HIS PAVILION and in THE SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME. HE SHALL SET ME UPON A ROCK. I'M IN A TOWER TODAY. HALLELUJAH. HOW COULD I MISS THE RAPTURE WHEN THIS TOWER IS A ROCKET SHIP? AMEN. IS BOUND FOR GLORY. AND IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR TAKEOFF, CHURCH. AMEN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. JUST GET IN IT. HALLELUJAH. GET IN IT, BROTHER RONNIE. JUST GET IN IT. JUST BELIEVE IT. JUST JUST EAT IT UP. &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR IDENTIFICATION. We got a token. Brother Brim said in the token, he said, "All those who are identified in Christ by the token, God is going to take them with him when he comes." Hallelujah. How do I know I'm taking a rapture? Cuz I'm identified. I've got a token on display. Amen. It says, "I bel I I I am the rapture. &gt;&gt; I am the message. &gt;&gt; I am the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; by putting me in Christ." &gt;&gt; Now, we come I've spent the first half of my sermon to try to show your position. How many see it? &gt;&gt; By putting me in Christ, he already put me in the rapture. &gt;&gt; And now we've come to our judges story. How many can see that woman up in the tower? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; You're that little woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not, you maybe aren't much, but you got a you're on a tower. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been lifted up to a place, amen, of protection. And you're that little woman in the tower, and we can see our position. We could preach all day long how that little woman, she wasn't hid somewhere on the first story or the second story or the seventh story. Here she is in plain view. Amen. She had to come all the way to the top of a tower where there's a stone. Amen. A capstone, a millstone. SHE'S ON TOP OF A TOWER. SEE, THE MILLSTONE'S BEEN BROKEN. AMEN. THE HARVEST has already come. Amen. The the the the the the fields have been ALREADY BEEN RIPE. THAT'S WHY THE ENEMY'S COMING. THAT'S WHAT HE'S AFTER IS THE FOOD THAT she's got. AMEN. BUT SHE'S GOT A MILLSTONE. IT'S NOT NEEDED FOR WHAT IT USED TO BE NEEDED FOR. NOW THERE'S ONE MORE THING TO DO WITH THAT STONE. AMEN. AND THAT'S KILL A KING. HALLELUJAH, FRIENDS. AMEN. SHE'S ON A TOWER. OH, GLORY. AND IT'S TIME TO KILL A KING. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, WHAT KING ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BROTHER NATHAN? THE BOOK OF JOB. CALL HIM THE KING OF TERRORS. AMEN. THE GREAT KING DEATH, THE KING OF ALL TERRORS, THE KING OF ALL FEARS. THIS GREAT KING. AMEN. He's the He's the He's the fear of everyone, rich or poor, of everyone, GREAT OR SMALL. IT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, DEATH COMES FOR US ALL. IT'S THE GREAT EQUALIZER. AMEN. Even kings and emperors and great men FEAR THIS KING OF ALL TERRORS. AMEN. Every fear is beneath him. He's a prince among devils. He is a king. He's a murderer. HE'S A SLAYER OF THE BRETHREN. AMEN. HE'S A KILLER OF THE JUDGES SONS. AMEN. THAT'S WHO THIS KING IS. AMEN. BUT NOW WE FIND OUT WHERE WE'RE AT, WHERE WE HAVE COME TO. AMEN. WE'RE IN A TOWER AND THE KING IS DOWN THERE. AND IT'S TIME, LITTLE BRIDE, TO KILL A KING. IT'S TIME TO TAKE A STONE OF REVELATION IN YOUR HANDS AND STRIKE THE ENEMY WITH IT. IT'S TIME TO STRIKE THE FINAL BLOW. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That great carrying bird. He been circling over humanity ever since Eve fell. Feasting on all of our rot and all of our corruption. Amen. And everywhere power collects, corruption comes in. Next thing you know, our boys are going out to die in wars. And our little girls are Amen. are are falling subject to the whim of the enemy. Amen. He's a He's a killer. He's a terrible king. Don't feel bad for him. He's a villain. He ain't a good guy. [laughter] Amen. But I tell you what, it's time for him to die, isn't it? &gt;&gt; See, but see, he's a great king of terrors. But Jesus already defeated him. &gt;&gt; Jesus defeated death. Hebrews says through death, Christ would destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil. &gt;&gt; And deliver them who through, listen, through fear of death, they were all their lifetimes subject to bondage. That's what it means to be a fallen human being is all your life you're under the bondage of no matter how good my life is here, death will come for me in the end. It's bondage. It's not freedom. It's not life. It's bondage. Amen. But Christ came to die that through his own death, he could put to death death itself. Amen. Oh my. And set everybody at liberty from the fear of death. Brother Brham would say he conquered death and hell. He conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they're of a natural seed. See, you're of a natural in your natural seed, you can't conquer, but he already conquered. This is a spiritual seed. He conquered the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification. And now we are more than conquerors. Now, Brother Brham WOULD SAY WE ARE DEALING with a defeated enemy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that might be news to you. The enemy that you're dealing with is a defeated enemy. &gt;&gt; It's a powerless enemy. Amen. It's a It's a defeated enemy. Sickness is defeated. Brother Bam said, "Death is defeated. Hell is defeated. Everything is defeated. And we are disputing with a conquered enemy." No wonder Paul could say when they were even when they were building a block to chop his head off, Paul would say, "Oh, death, where is your sting?" And I want to see I want you to see the gravity of this moment of being the rapture church of living in the day of rapturing faith and rapturing grace. What it means IS BECAUSE PAUL WOULD PREACH US THE SERMON OF the resurrection and say, "Oh grave, where is your sting? Oh death, where your sting, grave, where's your victory?" And he would he would rail against that defeated enemy. Amen. But the axe still came for his head. Amen. Peter was there when Jesus rose from THE GRAVE AND HE TESTIFIED HIS WHOLE LIFE of the resurrection of Christ. But there WAS A CROSS WAITING. AMEN. WHERE HE WOULD HANG THERE UPSIDE DOWN AND CHOKE TO DEATH. AMEN. UH TRUSTING IN THE PROMISE OF A RESURRECTION. AMEN. SEE, THERE'S A FINAL BLOW THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE STRUCK. AMEN. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN, FRIENDS. AMEN. DEATH IS ALREADY DEFEATED, BUT THERE IS A TIME OF MANIFESTATION. THERE IS A TIME TO STRIKE THE FINAL BLOW. DEATH TOOK OUR APOSTLES. DEATH TOOK OUR MESSENGERS. DEATH TOOK OUR PROPHET. BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A GENERATION THAT WILL NOT TASTE DEATH. [applause] &gt;&gt; That old wasp. Amen. He can grab you, but he can't sting you. Amen. CUZ HIS STINGER WAS PULLED OUT ON THE CROSS. HE STUCK IT SO DEEP INTO CHRIST. AMEN. THAT IT WAS RIPPED OUT WHEN HE RELEASED HIM. AMEN. DEATH CAN TAKE YOU IN HIS CLUTCHES AND TAKE YOU, AMEN. AND ALL IT CAN DO IS ROCK YOU TO SLEEP. IT HAS NO POWER over you, friends. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OLD SAINTS SLEEPING IN THE GRAVE. What are they waiting for? WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR? WHAT ARE THEY RESTING ON? AMEN. WHAT HOW LONG ARE THEY GOING TO SLEEP, FRIENDS? Just above our text in First Corinthians, the Bible says that he must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet. And the last enemy &gt;&gt; that shall be destroyed is death. &gt;&gt; It's the final blow. &gt;&gt; It's the final victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Oh, it's Do you see it, CHURCH? THE LAST ENEMY THAT SHALL BE DESTROYED IS DEATH. THAT'S why we read in the scripture there, we see exactly what the rapture of the church is. When this corruptible puts on incorruption, when this mortal puts on immortality, then [laughter] can I SAY NOW? &gt;&gt; THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DAY LIKE THIS DAY. NOW, IN THIS AT THIS HOUR, AT THIS TIME, IS BROUGHT TO PASS THE SAYING, DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP IN VICTORY. OH, DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING? OH, CRAVE, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE FINAL BLOW. &gt;&gt; I pray I PRAY THIS HUMBLE SERMON WOULD CHANGE SOMEBODY'S VIEW ON THE rapture forever. Amen. Cuz you see, we view the RAPTURE AND WE JUST THINK ABOUT IT as our escape. WE THINK ABOUT IT GETTING SNATCHED AWAY FROM TROUBLE. And it is that. Amen. But it's more than that, church. Amen. I know. I love that the Lord's coming. I love to think that the Lord will come between 6:00 and 9 in the morning cuz 9:00 is when I usually start work. I say, Lord, even so, Jesus, Monday morning, even so. Amen. I KNOW HOW WE THINK AS HUMAN BEINGS, BUT THE RAPTURE IS MORE THAN YOUR GETAWAY CAR. IT'S MORE THAN AN ESCAPE PLAN. IT'S A VICTORY. AMEN. IT'S A AMEN. IT'S A BLOW. IT'S A YOU'RE GOING TO AMEN. YOU ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO STRIKE THE FINAL BLOW AND KILL THE KING OF TERRORS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU ARE GOING TO PUT YOUR FEET ON THE NECK OF DEATH. THAT'S WHAT IT MEAN. OH MY. WHEN YOU STEP INTO THAT REALM, AMEN. YOU ARE YOU ARE PLACING AMEN YOUR FOOT ON THE NECK OF A KING OF DEVILS. AMEN. YOU ARE PUTTING HIM UNDER YOUR FEET. AMEN. YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE OVERRULING the law of death. &gt;&gt; That's what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. We think we're troubled. Amen. You got to understand the Exodus story, right? You think we think we're troubled. We think we're we're in bondage. We're the one slaved. You're the one causing the devil trouble. You see? Amen. Maybe earlier on in the church ages. Amen. And earlier on when the first plagues were fallen, Amen. Maybe there was a back and forth, but by the time it got to that last plague, Amen. by the time it came to the plague of death, Amen, [laughter] that Pharaoh was so sick of Goan, HE SAID, "I'VE DONE I'VE PUT SO MUCH WORK ON YOU. I'VE I'VE I'VE PILED UP SO MUCH ON YOUR BACK. I'VE WHIPPED YOU. I'VE FLOGGED YOU. I'VE OPPRESSED YOU." AMEN. BUT I JUST I'M JUST READY TO GET RID OF YOU. EVERYTHING I'VE TRIED, NOTHING HAS WORKED. HEY, I' I'VE TRIED, AMEN, TO GET YOU TO FORGET YOUR IDENTIFICATION. I TRIED TO TAKE YOUR FIRSTBORN SONS. AMEN. BUT YOU WON'T STOP. SO [screaming] GET OUT OF HERE. I'M TIRED OF YOU. WHAT A VICTORY, CHURCH. AMEN. IT'S TO THEM. AMEN. It's to them who are alive and remain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the se young people can quote it. The secret is don't quit. [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; See, brother would tell us in stature of a perfect man. He said these people who died are depending and waiting on us. &gt;&gt; So the church has got to come per to perfection in order to bring the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Now how we already I already read the quote. How could you be perfect? &gt;&gt; You got to be in Christ. But when you get into that identification, that's what all these people who died have waited for is for the church to come into her position to strike that final blow. Of course, this is 62. Brother Bram still had him souls under the altar. But the principle is they're waiting for this church to come to its perfection when Christ comes. Brother, brother, sister, there's a cloud of witnesses. The Bible talks about you realize we're the final runners. I know it's been preached on and preached on and preached on. I just pray it become real today. That we're we're the final ones. Amen. And there's a cloud of witnesses like has never been. saints, amen, that went by way of the grave and there and sometimes watching over the banister cheering you on saying, "Don't you quit." Amen. Don't don't you give in. You just KEEP HOLDING ON. IN FACT, THERE'S no such THING OF HOLDING ON. YOU JUST TRUST THE LORD. HE'S THE ONE HOLDING on to you. Amen. Just keep running. JUST KEEP GOING. THIS AIN'T A SPEED RACE. THIS IS AN endurance race. IF YOU FALL DOWN, GET BACK UP. CAN'T YOU HEAR THE CLOUD SAYING, "JUST DON'T QUIT." AMEN. CUZ THERE'S A FINAL BLOW COMING. THERE'S A FINISH LINE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE THE ONES TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Run that final lamp. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE THE SIGN. &gt;&gt; BREAK THE CYCLE. &gt;&gt; Wretched man that I am. Who shall deliver me? &gt;&gt; And now it's time for death to die. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's time for death to die. Now, here's my key quote. But if you don't pay attention to anything but this next five minutes, watch this quote with me. Brother Andrew brought this a couple weeks ago. It just fits perfect. The way of a true prophet, brother Brandham said, "Death is nothing." &gt;&gt; We [clears throat] got it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's ours. &gt;&gt; It can't control me. &gt;&gt; I control it. &gt;&gt; How? Through him who made me an overcomer. CUZ I'VE ALREADY OVERCOME DEATH. HOW DID I DO IT? I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER DOING IT. HOW DID I DO IT? BY BELIEVING ON HIM. AH, DEATH IS SIN AND UNBELIEF. I'M NOT AN UNBELIEVER. I'M A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; I'M RAISED FROM THAT THING. I'm resurrected. [applause] It's the earnest of my complete physical and spiritual resurrection. &gt;&gt; Physical and spiritual. Amen. You see it. You get it. SO, WE DO HAVE DEATH UNDER OUR CONTROL through Christ Jesus who has overcome death, hell, grave, sickness, sorrow, and everything else. In case you had thought of something else to put in there, everything else &gt;&gt; triumphed over all and we are now risen with him, setting in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; SPIRITUALLY SPEAKING, WE ARE IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SAY, "NATURALLY, Brother Nathan, I'm depressed. Naturally, I've been under a cloud. Naturally, I'm struggling with some thing. Naturally, I'm sick in my body." SPIRITUALLY SPEAKING, YOU'RE IN CHRIST JESUS. AND BECAUSE YOU'RE IN CHRIST JESUS, YOU GOT ALL THINGS UNDER YOUR FEET. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, I'M WORRIED ABOUT MISSING THE RAPTURE. EVEN THE PHYSICAL RESURRECTION IS UNDER OUR FEET BECAUSE WE'RE IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; SPIRITUALLY AND PHYSICALLY, WE ARE RESURRECTED ALREADY. [applause] I WANT TO PREACH WITH THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTION TODAY AND LET THE DEVIL KNOW THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS THE TIME. IT IS TIME FOR DEATH TO DIE. [applause] HE'S ALREADY UNDER MY FEET. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, if physical death can't stop you, how could spiritual death? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "We're in the bride age." And the bride age is A RESURRECTION OUT OF DARK DENOMINATIONALISM. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT EXPECTING TRUER TABERNACLE TO DIE SPIRITUALLY. I'M NOT EXPECTING, AS LONG AS WE KEEP PREACHING THIS MESSAGE, I AIN'T EXPECTING SPIRITUAL DEATH. I'M NOT EXPECTING THE REVIVAL TO DIE. IT'S NOT BUILT ON A MAN. IT'S NOT BUILT ON A CHURCH. IT'S NOT BUILT ON A PEOPLE. IT'S RESTING ON OUR IDENTIFICATION FOR THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; WE ARE spiritually resurrected. &gt;&gt; SPIRITUAL DEATH, BROTHER RAM said that's not See, that's not Satan's curse on you. Brother Ram said, spiritual death is God's final blow against the enemy. See, God has struck a blow. Amen. You say, "Brother Nathan, why'd I spend all that time in that dead church?" I'll tell you what, it was God's blow. Amen. to kill that church so dead that you would get so thirsty for life you would have to come out of it. Amen. It wasn't Satan's curse on you. Amen. It was God's curse on Satan. AMEN. TO DRY UP AND WITHER EVERY SYSTEM THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DECEIVE YOU SO THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT OF THAT IDENTIFICATION AND GET INTO CHRIST FOR THIS HOUR WHICH IS THE REVELATION OF THE MESSAGE PREACHED BY WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT'S A RESURRECTED LORD JESUS IN A WORD COMING IN THE FORMATION OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WE ARE [screaming] ALIVE. WE'RE NOT DEAD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE TO DIE SPIRITUALLY. I DON'T HAVE TO BE MISERABLE. I DON'T HAVE TO BE DEAD AND COLD AND FORMAL AND GIVE UP MY POWER. I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. NOT MY CURSE. NOT MY IDENTITY. &gt;&gt; NOT WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; I'm resurrected. I'm already fired up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what the token says. Says, uh-uh, not my curse. Blood is on the door. &gt;&gt; This ain't a quote quote message. This is a death killing message. &gt;&gt; I tell you, when you you you run with this message, wherever you find some dead formal creed, anywhere you find a dead tradition of man, you kill it. That's what you're anointed to do. Brother said he was anointed to destroy the works of the devil and his body is the same. That's what we're ON EARTH TO DO. EVERY TIME, EVERY BRUSH UP WE HAVE WITH DEAD CHRISTIANITY, KILL THAT THING. YOU'RE A DEATH SLAYER. AMEN. YOU'RE A LIFEBRINGER. AMEN. YOU ARE THE CHANNEL &gt;&gt; OF THE token life. &gt;&gt; Death killers. [panting] Brother Brandham. Amen. remember he shared the story rejected king and he spoke a little about it and even the next week he was still talking about it how that the Lord let him go over there and see all of his converts and be in that place that presence and exper just get a taste of that life of that perfect love and and wrap his arms around those people amen oh and it affected him amen when he realized I've got a part over there I've got a legacy over there I got treasures there's people over there amen that belong Amen. That that are associated with me and my ministry. I got something waiting for me on the other side. Oh, Brother Pam would say, "I'll never forget what happened that last Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget it." He said, "It's done SOMETHING TO ME THAT'S revolutionized my life." &gt;&gt; I do not fear. I have not one fear of death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; DEATH HAS NO FEAR at all. And brother B says, "And it doesn't for you if you just understood." Friends, if you just understood, if you could just see your identification, death would lose all its toll on you. Fear could NEVER TOUCH YOU. AMEN. YOU'D BE CHANGED FOREVER. AS BROTHER BRANDON WAS A CHANGED MAN, JUST FROM ONE TASTE OF THAT FUTURE HOME. AMEN. We would change it forever. I TELL YOU WHAT, WE LOSE THINGS HERE AND IT SEEMS SO REAL. I THINK ABOUT BROTHER CHUCK COLLINS. AMEN. How he went through the great trauma of losing a son in the flower of his life and we all lost our Charlie. Amen. and and and and it you know it changes A PERSON. GRIEF CHANGES A PERSON. AMEN. BUT BUT OUR BROTHER BEING SO UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THAT SORROW. AMEN. BUT THE GRACE OF GOD WOULD COME TO HIM IN A DREAM. AMEN. AND HE WOULD LOOK HIS SON IN THE EYE. AMEN. HOW MANY HEARD BROTHER BROTHER CHUCK share about it? AMEN. AND EVERY TIME HE GETS TO TRYING TO DESCRIBE JUST WHAT CHARLIE LOOKED LIKE. THERE'S NO WORDS THAT COULD BE FORMED. THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD WRAP AROUND THE SUBLIMENESS. AMEN. OF THAT LIFE OVER THERE. [laughter] HALLELUJAH. ALL RIGHT. IT WASN'T THE CHARLIE WE KNEW. IT WAS A DIFFERENT CHARLIE. AND EVER SINCE GOD SENT THAT DREAM, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S A DIFFERENT CHUCK COLLINS. AND IT'LL BE A DIFFERENT IT'LL BE DIFFERENT FOR YOU AND I. AMEN. WHEN WE UNDERSTAND, I'VE GOT A FUTURE HOME. I'VE GOT ANOTHER LIFE. I'VE GOT ANOTHER BODY WAITING FOR ME. [applause] IT CHANGES EVERYTHING. DEATH LOSES ITS WHOLE. FEAR LOSES ITS GRIP. [applause] YES, SIR. Just a taste of that resurrection. It's so real. Amen. Sister Gail, you know, losing Sister Sarah maybe hasn't been mentioned in a while. And sometimes the devil comes say, "Well, everybody else is forgotten. THEY FORGOT MY GRIEF. THEY FORGOT MY BURDEN." AMEN. BUT IT'S NOT FORGOTTEN. AMEN. And there's nothing that can ever change. Amen. Amen. Her eternal status. Amen. THE THE SUFFERINGS THAT WE BEAR IN THIS PRESENT TIME AREN'T EVEN WORTHY TO BE COMPARED TO THE GLORY OF THAT BEAUTIFUL RESURRECTION, OF THAT BEAUTIFUL REUNION. AMEN. WE'LL SEE CHARLIE THERE. WE'LL SEE RACHEL THERE. WE'LL SEE LIZ THERE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WE'LL SEE HIM. I THINK ABOUT SISTER LINDA. AMEN. Uh if there ever was a woman faithful and loving to her husband as our loyal sister Linda. Amen. A servant's heart that she has. Amen. But one of these days, all these lonely nights will be paid BACK WITH INTEREST. AMEN. ONE OF THESE DAYS, ONE MORNING BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9, THE VEIL WILL OPEN UP AND IT'LL BE LIKE NONE OF THE SORROW EVER HAPPENED. HALLELUJAH. OH MY, IT'LL BE GLORIOUS. WHAT WILL IT BE WHEN WE GET OVER YONDER? &gt;&gt; I'm a father of seven. Amen. You know, because we lost four babies. Amen. But but God supernaturally, I could share the testimony. Amen. God supernaturally by the message revealed to us where they're at. We never lost them. I got three children, Amen, that are that are that are blooming here. And I got four children that are blossoming there. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEIR name is. BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS, AMEN, I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO PUT MY HANDS AROUND, AMEN, WHAT ALWAYS BELONG TO ME. ONE OF THESE DAYS, IT'LL ALL BE OKAY. ONE OF THESE DAYS, EVERYTHING WILL BE SET RIGHT. AMEN. SOON AND VERY SOON. AND I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE A MESSAGE TO TELL ME THIS IS THE DAY OF RESURRECTION. [applause] I'm resting on it. I'm resting on it. I'm not working. I'm not worried. Resting on it. [panting] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what the voice of resurrection has to tell to the enemy. Amen. This is a declaration against death. Amen. Because there is a death. Amen. That the devil has no power to put on you. &gt;&gt; There's worse things than dying, friends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is a death waiting in the lake of fire. And this death now to an eternal being. How could there be any more horrible concept than this? Amen. That there is a place somewhere of total annihilation. Not you die and you go to another place, but you cease to exist and a being that was created no longer is. Amen. There is a death. It's the second death. It comes after the white throne judgment. Amen. But to know but to know this, friends, Jesus said those that have Amen. The Bible said those that have part in the first resurrection, Amen. They shall not taste the second death. Because hell is not created, Amen, for God's children. It was created for the devil and his angels. Amen. AND THAT'S WHY YOU GOT TO LET THE DEVIL KNOW, AMEN. CUZ LOOK, DEVIL, YOU COULD TAKE, AMEN. YOU MIGHT WAR AGAINST ME. YOU MIGHT TRY TO BRING SPIRITUAL DEATH ON ME. YOU COULD TAKE MY MY LOVED ONES BY WAY OF THE GRAVE. BUT THERE'S COMING A DAY, AMEN, WHEN DEATH WILL DIE A DEATH THAT WE'LL NEVER KNOW. AMEN. DEATH WILL CEASE TO BE. DEATH WILL BE ANNIHILATED. AND ALL OF HIS IMPS AND DEVILS WILL GO AND BURN WITH HIM. AND THEY WILL PERISH. AND LONG AFTER DEATH IS DEAD, WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE ALIVE. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHO WE ARE, FRIENDS. TELL IT TO THE DEVIL. NOW IS THE HOUR TO PREACH IT. THIS IS RAPTURE TIME. EXERCISE YOUR RAPTURE FAITH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE DEVIL WANTS TO TALK ABOUT YOUR PAST, you just remind him of his future. &gt;&gt; Blessed and holy is he that hath per the first resurrection. On such the second death hath no power. &gt;&gt; That's a reason to rejoice. &gt;&gt; That's a reason to be re to rejoice. Now this final blow, you see you see who you are. You see what's in your hand. You see you see the message. Now you see what you're supposed to do with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that little woman, now this big important king with all his buddies around him, man's man, warrior, &gt;&gt; political animal. Yeah. You rec you to recognize you. You might not know what he look like. You recognize the spirit. &gt;&gt; Big shot, &gt;&gt; big eye, little you. &gt;&gt; Big important. Who do you think you are?

I'm going to smash that tower down [panting] &gt;&gt; and a little old washer woman, &gt;&gt; a little old housewife, a little school teacher or something. See, he had already killed half the warriors. And all that was left, Amen, was mama had to get up there with a rock. Amen. And do a man-sized job. [laughter] And when she threw that rock down on that devil, I want you to see THE PICTURE. IT WAS SUCH a humiliation to that king. Amen. That he would HAVE RATHER HE WOULD RATHER FALL ON HIS OWN SWORD. AMEN. Than let THE TESTIMONY BE THAT A WOMAN PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY THE DEVIL ONE OF THESE DAYS AFTER A THOUSAND YEARS OF BEING BOUND BY CHAINS OF CIRCUMSTANCE, HE'LL SAY, "PLEASE THROW ME IN THAT LAKE OF FIRE. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I'M SICK OF THE HUMILIATION. I'M SICK OF THIS WOMAN. I'M SICK OF THIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; JUST LET ME DIE. GLORY. [applause] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says she was a certain woman. And I just love that that she was a CERTAIN WOMAN. NOW, SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE FELT CERTAIN. AMEN. SHE SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE FELT CERTAIN. You know, she she she I'm not certain if I can even lift this rock. I I'm not certain if I'll be able to keep my balance. I I don't even I'm not certain THAT I CAN HIT MY MARK. I'll tell you what, brother Jonathan was preaching on that third pole. Brother man, we came to that squirrel. He didn't even have to aim, friends. You could be certain ABOUT THIS MESSAGE CUZ THE POWER, THE EXCELLENCY OF THE POWER IS OF GOD AND NOT OF YOU. HALLELUJAH. JUST JUST THROW THE ROCK. &gt;&gt; LET GOD DO THE REST. &gt;&gt; OH MY. SEE, SHE WAS SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN CERTAIN. YOU MIGHT NOT BE CERTAIN. BUT THE WORD IS CERTAIN THAT THERE MUST BE A BRIDE AT THE LAST DAY TO STRIKE THE FINAL BLOW against the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had to be here. God needed somebody on top of the tower. &gt;&gt; You had to be there. [panting] &gt;&gt; And he knew you wouldn't be all that much. That's why he put you in a tower cuz a tower is a force multiplier. &gt;&gt; That's a you know that's a strategic term. Yeah. I may understand what that means is that look, you might you might be you might not be much of a of a warrior [panting] down on level ground, but put you up on a tower and you hold off 10 men. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz you pile seven de 10 devils up on that ladder and all you got to do is rip. Amen. So being in that tower multiplies your force. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. THAT'S THE KIND OF GOD WE SERVE. JESUS IS A MULTIPLIER. JESUS, TAKE A LITTLE LOAF, JUST ONE LITTLE BOY'S LUNCH, AND HE COULD FEED 5,000. HE COULD FEED A MULTITUDE. AMEN. JESUS, TAKE WATER AND MULTIPLY IT. MAKE IT MORE THAN IT IS. AND JESUS, TAKE FISH AND MULTIPLY IT. THAT'S WHO HE IS. BUT WHEN THE THIRD PULL COME, HE CAN DO YOU SOMETHING EVEN BETTER THAN THAT. CUZ I'M TELLING YOU, GOD CAN TAKE YOUR LITTLE ITTY BITTY LITTLE SELF AND HE CAN MAKE he can MULTIPLY IT. HE CAN MULTIPLY YOUR FORCE. HE CAN MULTIPLY YOUR POWER. HE CAN MAKE YOU A GREAT WARRIOR EVEN IF YOU'RE NOTHING. AMEN. EVEN IF YOU'RE WEAK, AMEN, HE CAN BE STRONG IN YOU. Cuz that's the kind OF GOD HE IS. BUT WHEN THE THIRD poll come, Amen. Brother Bam said God did something different to something like it's never been. He said because he didn't just take something and multiply it, but he put a squirrel where there was nothing at all. So it wasn't a work of multiplication. It was a work of creation. &gt;&gt; So I'm trying to tell you, long as YOU GET IN THIS MESSAGE, YOU CAN BE NOTHING AND GOD CAN MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF YOU. YES. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. CUZ IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A MESSAGE OF CREATION. IT'S A THIRD PULL. RESTORATION OF THE SPOKEN WORD. CREATIVE POWER. &gt;&gt; IT DON'T MATTER HOW UNBRIDE LIKE YOU ARE. GOD IS GOING TO CREATE a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what a security. &gt;&gt; I need to I need to make an example. I got to choose someone at random. Samuel, stand up. [laughter] &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; Listen, Samuel, [sighs] it appears to me from over here that you are not an angel. Is that correct? You appeared and now your flesh looks a little better than my flesh. But you seem to be a flesh man. You ever made a mistake, Samuel? Did you ever know to do something and you didn't do it? Did you ever know not to do something? You did it anyway. Yeah. So you you So you you're living in flesh imperfection. You got you ever felt a complex? You ever felt a doubt? You ever felt a fear? And I have too. Amen. But keep standing, buddy. I want to I want the church to take notice. And I want the devil to take notice. And I want all heavens and earth to take notice. THAT'S THE KIND OF person that's going in the rapture. [applause] &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS NOT FOR ANGELS. THE RAPTURE IS NOT FOR DEVILS. IT'S FOR SOMEBODY IN BETWEEN. [applause] YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON [applause] THAT'S GOING IN RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; I know the DEVIL DON'T LIKE IT. [applause] SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN LIKE IT, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE. &gt;&gt; GLORY. [cheering] I LOVE THAT SONG THAT WE SING. HE'LL COME for the weak and the STRONG JUST THE SAME. Cuz the RAPTURE AIN'T FOR SUPERHUMAN CHRISTIANS. IT'S FOR CHRISTIANS WITH A SUPER MESSAGE AND A SUPER ANOINTING AND A SUPER CALLING TO STAND IN THE TOWER OF IDENTIFICATION AND STRIKE THE final blow against death itself. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I was listening to brother Brandham. Amen. Talk about that preview of the bride. Here come the American church twisting and perverted and awful and dirty. And brother Brandham begin to weep. say, he said, "After all I've tried, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; after everything I've tried to do, &gt;&gt; after all of that work," HE SAID, "IS THAT ALL that we could produce?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; IS THAT ALL? THAT'S THE BEST I COULD DO. And I want to say this in full respect to the prophet, if it was just William Brandham, I believe that is the best he could do. &gt;&gt; I believe THAT THAT AMERICAN CHURCH, THAT'S THE BEST WE COULD HAVE DONE, CHURCH. THAT IS THE VERY BEST WE COULD HAVE PUT FORTH &gt;&gt; IF IT WAS UP TO YOU AND IF IT WAS UP TO ME. BUT THANK GOD THERE WAS MORE TO THE VISION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CUZ HE SAW MORE THAN A BUNCH OF LAYOUT OF SEA AND DEATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SAW A SINLESS, SPOTLESS, VIRTUOUS, HOLY, VICTORIOUS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; Christian soldiers. &gt;&gt; I dare say, friends, [panting] see, one of these days, I know we live in this flesh, but that's what the rapture is all about. One of these days, the flesh is going to have to yield cuz the word will never change. And there's not enough strength in the weakness of your flesh to make God's word alive. &gt;&gt; Ah, are you resting in it today? &gt;&gt; You look at Rahab. Rahab stand there under her token. Now, now realistically, statistically, would you have given her any odds of survival? Knowing her background and knowing her situation, knowing her identity, knowing where she came from, knowing what kind of a people she belonged to and what she had been raised under, would you have given her a chance? She never should have had a chance, but under a token. The rest of Jericho could fall, but her tower stood standing. Hallelujah, friends. Amen. And she was married. Amen. To the Amen. to the captain of the army. FRIENDS, WE'RE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. TO THE WORLD, WE MIGHT LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF UPJUMP SINNERS. WE MIGHT LOOK THEY THEY MIGHT THINK THAT WE'RE PROUD AND ARROGANT. AMEN. TO TALK ABOUT OUR JUSTIFICATION. AMEN. BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT OURSELVES. WE'RE LOOKING AT HIM IN WHOM WE ARE IN. WE'RE LOOKING AT A MESSAGE. AMEN. Which has washed us by the water of the word and has cleaned up our reputation and given us a new identity. Oh friends. Hallelujah. See, that's what that's what kills the devil. That's what humiliates him. Amen. Because we read in the scripture what the devil wanted. He said, "I will I'll be like the most high. I'll be a god. I'll be a great one." He said, "And I'll I'll go up there and I'll reside on the sides of the north." You know what that sides of the north is? That's Zion. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Zion. Amen. That's that's that fortress. That's the place. Amen. And so, what a humiliation is it to the devil. Amen. Being a prince among angels. And he had his ambition to sit in that place. And for a thousand years, he'll have TO NASH HIS TEETH AND SAY, "BUT THOSE PEOPLE, I WAS THERE WHEN THEY MADE THEIR MISTAKES. I WATCHED THEM WHEN THEY SINNED AGAINST GOD. I WATCHED THEM WHEN THEY SAID THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID. I WATCHED THEM WHEN THEY DID THINGS THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE. I WAS THERE." AMEN. AND NOW I GOT TO SIT HERE AND WATCH THEM. AMEN. SIT IN THAT THRONE. THAT'S WHERE I WANTED TO BE. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY POSITION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT BY YOUR IDENTIFICATION IN CHRIST, THAT THRONE BELONGS TO YOU. THE DEVIL CAN'T HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; SIN AND MISTAKES CAN'T KEEP YOU FROM IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOURS. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, I know that besides been throwing a rod at a lot of rocks lately. I see it on the countenance of young people. I I feel it in the atmosphere around around around here that that we're always under attack all the time. And the devil comes with condemnation. The devil comes with guilt and shame. And he's trying to just throw rocks all the time at people. I'll tell you what, I think it's time to throw one back for a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't Don't let the devil do all the rock throwing, friends. Amen. You you you take a revelation of this word and drop it back down on him. Amen. He starts throwing rocks. YOU SAY, "OH, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT." YOU SAY, "I've already made it. [applause] YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE. I'M GOING TO [cheering] BEAT YOU." WE ARE HIS VICTORY. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; I'M THE PURE, VIRTUOUS, SINLESS BRIDE OF THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, JUSTIFIED. NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, let the accuser beware cuz that that accuser does a lot of talking. He throws a lot of accusations. But Jesus told a woman one time that those without sin are allowed to throw stones. And when YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT YOU'RE JUSTIFIED, AMEN. YOU GOT A RIGHT TO THROW ROCKS AT THE ENEMY. YOU GOT A RIGHT TO STAND ON GOD'S WORD. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR FLESH TELLS YOU, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR MEMORY TELLS YOU, NO MATTER WHAT YESTERDAY TELLS YOU. AMEN. YOU STAND IN YOUR TOWER. AMEN. AND DON'T DON'T GIVE UP YOUR POSITIVE CONFESSION FOR ANYTHING. I'M SINLESS. I'M VIRTUOUS. I'M BLOODWASHED. I'M JUSTIFIED. I'M ALREADY GLORIFIED. &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing you can do about it, devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what that invincible army is, brother Nathan. We're supposed to be the invincible army. How could we be losing these skirmishes? Look, invincible army, a great warrior, David. It wasn't about Saul's armor. It was about David's faith. See, that's why, you know, I'm not trying to I feel no burden to try to get the bride of Christ to a place where, okay, make sure you read the right book. Make sure you get in the right program and make sure, you know, you you you just uh uh come through my my psychiatric analysis, you know, and and come through, you know, and get under my teaching and make sure you go to the right church and and all trying to dress you up. That might have worked for Saul. Actually, it didn't. &gt;&gt; It never did work for Saul. So why would David need that? To be an invincible warrior. I'll tell you what you need. Amen. To go in a rapture. I'll tell you what you need to be an invincible army. To be an overcome of this of this day, you don't need a sinless perfection. You don't you you you don't need an angel uh uh existence. You just need f a t- su. Take them rocks. Amen. Look, JUST LET HER FLY, FRIENDS. GOD WILL do the rest. Amen. JUST JUST YOU DON'T DON'T AIM. DON'T DON'T PREMEDITATE. NO, JUST JUST THROW THAT ROCK. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT THE WORD. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. STAND ON IT. &gt;&gt; SMACK THE DEVIL WITH IT. AND IF he don't move, smack him again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I friends, I believe we're here to destroy death. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, that's what you're you are a death killer. So that means when when when anxiety shows up, anxiety, how could I lose to you? I'm here to kill your boss. &gt;&gt; Cancer. &gt;&gt; I know cancer is a killer, but I'm here to kill the killer of all killers. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm here to overcome death itself. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Depression. &gt;&gt; Pornography. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're a giant, but I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; I GOT A ROCK TO THROW. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT FIXING TO LOSE. AMEN. I'M FIXING TO I'M FIXING TO LIVE. BROTHER BRAND SAID, "I'M NOT GETTING READY TO DIE. I'M GETTING READY TO LIVE." &gt;&gt; How will I do it? I'll do it by abiding in my tower. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, Brother Brand, here's here's here's a key in the greatest battle ever fought. This sermon all about mind battles. And brother Brown, he he shows you young people how this devil works and how he comes and he just starts talking and talking and talking and talking. He'll tell you about, well, you know, you're trying to believe for healing and Miss Jones believe for healing and it, you know, somebody prayed for this and it didn't seem to happen and and this happened. Everything is all in your mind and everything. Brother Bam, that's his tactic. See, that's how he works. But Brother Bam said, "Look now, now watch your tower." He said, "But when you come, it's just you and God &gt;&gt; together and nobody else but you two." &gt;&gt; Just nobody else but you two. He said, "There's your battle. Kill him at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Kill him at the beginning. Stop him dead in his tracks. &gt;&gt; It ain't how long you can make the war linger. &gt;&gt; It's stop it right now." I try to talk about the final blow tonight. Amen. Yeah. I know we saw healings and deliverances and victories last night, but if you find this morning that that devil's just wiggling a little bit, if there's a little bit of breath in him to whisper in your ear, kill it right now. Strike your final blow. Amen. JUST LET FAITH DROP IN EVERY HEART. I PRAY RIGHT NOW TO SAY, "MY ENEMY IS DEAD." AMEN. HE'S BEEN PUT TO DEATH. I'M STRIKING THE FINAL BLOW. I AIN'T TRYING TO MAKE THIS WAR LINGER ON. I'M GOING TO KILL HIM RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN THE DEVIL COMES AND TRIES TO TALK TO YOU, THIS IS THE WAY YOUNG PEOPLE FAIL TO UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES. AMEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO AMEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE A WHOLE DOCTORATE OF THESIS AND HAVE A GREAT DEBATE WITH THE ENEMY AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHY HE SHOULD leave you alone. Amen. WHEN HE COMES TO ATTACK YOUR TOWER, YOU don't open up the door and say, "Come here, devil. Look here. Come on in and see. Uh, look, you know, we got this. We got these great krenellations, and look at this big stockpile of arrows we got. And look how thick these walls are. And look, I'm trying to explain to you devils. Stop. just leave me alone because I wish you would just please please would you just stop because you know uh cuz look you know I I CAN EXPLAIN LOOK look at read that scripture and see and uh but he's already inside. What you do is WHEN THE DEVIL SHOWS UP AT YOUR DOOR RESIST THE DEVIL DON'T MEAN ARGUE WITH HIM FOR 10 HOURS. RESIST THE DEVIL MEANS BOOM SLAM THE DOOR. KILL HIM AT THE BEGINNING. SHUT HIM OFF. AMEN. AND IF HE WON'T GO AWAY, THROW [screaming] ROCKS AT HIM TILL HE DOES. DON'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TALK. DON'T GIVE HIM THE TIME OF DAY. KILL [cheering] HIM RIGHT NOW. [applause] GOD'S ALREADY DEALT WITH YOUR ENEMY. NOW GO IN FOR THE KILL. GO IN FOR THE KILL IN THE NAME OF JESUS. GO IN FOR THE KILL. THAT DEVIL THAT'S BEEN TORMENTING YOU, NOW IS THE HOUR OF HIS DESTRUCTION. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; STOP HIM IN HIS TRACKS in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let every devil be bound and defeated. &gt;&gt; Friends, one of these days a sweep's going to come. &gt;&gt; But you know, he said that rapture would be wave after wave after wave of his glory. That's what I felt as brother Isaac began to preach. I've been under them dark clouds just like you. Yeah, I know how winter comes in, affects our bodies and affects our minds. We get under a little bit of darkness, a cloud. But as that word is being preached, dark clouds begin to roll back. Amen. And glory clouds begin to come. Amen. Look, friends, one of these Oh, what that what was that Friday night? What was that last night? Wave, wave. But one OF THESE DAYS, ONE LAST SWEEP. ONE MORE. JUST AND IT'LL BE JUST LIKE THAT. I BELIEVE JUST A JUST ANOTHER WAVE OF HIS PRESENCE. JUST THE SAME THING WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN USED TO, BUT IT'LL STRIKE JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE IN THAT PLACE. AMEN. It's so real. [panting] &gt;&gt; It's so real that we've already got one foot in it. &gt;&gt; We're already resurrected. &gt;&gt; Just waiting for the body to catch up. &gt;&gt; And then all of our troubles will be over. &gt;&gt; It'll all be over. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there won't be no more sickness. There won't be no more bad days. There won't be no parting. There won't be no more sorrow. It'll be over. &gt;&gt; Young people say, "I got so much life to live." Look, that won't be life won't be over when the rapture comes. That's when life will start. &gt;&gt; These minds and bodies can't even so they can't even wrap their mind around it. Good. It'll be so sublime. I would hope to think it would only be as good as we could imagine. I would hate to think that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it'll be more than we could ever imagine. &gt;&gt; And and we're so close, friends, if we could just recognize our position. &gt;&gt; If we could recognize the moment, take the revelation, and strike the final blow. &gt;&gt; When the bride realizes who she is, that's not when the rapture will come. He said, "That's when the rapture will go." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Cuz we're already in the rapture. The cycle's just got to finish. &gt;&gt; We're in the middle of that three-fold. &gt;&gt; And when he comes, he's going to set it all right. &gt;&gt; So much wrongness in this world. So much corrupt. You can't even You can't even You can't even pay attention to the news. You can't even just can't just got no tolerance for it. just instantly dark and pressing and awful and corrupt and wicked and just everywhere that we look it's wrong. We know that. Brother Bram said that's the pressure of the age is is is soft living in an age that we just are seem unfit to live in. It's not right. It's not life. It's not reality. It's not it's not what we were designed for. &gt;&gt; But when this final blow has been struck, everything that's wrong will become right. &gt;&gt; Everything will be set right, friends. everything that just bothers us and everything everything that torments us and I just wish oh it's so unjust it's so wicked it's so wrong all that sighing and crying will be over and he'll set it all right &gt;&gt; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there won't be no more crying there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away &gt;&gt; friends I believe if the rapture is going to set everything right this is just something that came to I believe Friday night kept me up half the night. That if this rapture is going to set things right, then oughtn't a rapture ready church &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; be able to set some things right? &gt;&gt; And and I and I got a burden on my heart. Say, look, we are the people &gt;&gt; that are anointed to strike that final blow. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to go outside the message to find some things that are wrong. &gt;&gt; Come on. and some things that have gone wrong, things that have been handled wrong, things that have been believed wrong. &gt;&gt; But I tell you, friends, I you you hear my burden today. Amen. That that that look, let's strike a final blow against the devil. &gt;&gt; As long as we're here in a battle, let's fight. Amen. Look, look, there there could be a church, Amen, where people really do love each other. There can be a church, YOU DON'T YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. I'VE TRAVELED PLACES, you know, and preaching places and people talked to and and WHAT THEY NEEDED WHAT they needed wasn't the sermon that I preached, &gt;&gt; but it was to hear about a church that could transfer leadership from one pastor to another and not go all to pieces. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PEOPLE PEOPLE OUT THERE need they need there to be a church. THEY NEED TO HEAR ABOUT A ABOUT a lunch like we had yesterday where 25 preachers can sit down and get along. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe friends, IF WE CAN SEE WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO, THEN WE CAN SET SOME THINGS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MADE FOR THIS WORLD, WE'RE MADE FOR THAT ONE. AMEN. AND I KNOW WE'RE STUCK IN THESE BODIES, BUT WE I BELIEVE WE CAN SET SOME THINGS RIGHT BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's that's where my heart is. I know I don't belong here, Brother Carrie, where everything's corrupt and people hurt one another. I belong there where where they where they throw their arms around another and even sister to brother. There'll be twice as much hugging over there. Amen. It's a place of love. It's a PLACE OF PERFECTION. IT'S A PLACE OF FELLOWSHIP. AMEN. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERY SUNDAY I COME TO CHURCH AND I GET A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT HEAVEN. AMEN. THAT'S WHY I LOVE I DON'T JUST LOVE THE MESSAGE. I LOVE MESSAGE PEOPLE. AMEN. CUZ THE ONES THAT I KNOW. AMEN. I I SEE THEIR HUMANITY, BUT I CAN SEE PAST THE VEIL AND I CAN SEE DEITY EXPRESSING ITSELF IN A PEOPLE. AMEN. AND THAT TELLS ME WE'RE JUST AT THE MOMENT. AMEN. TO MAKE THE FINAL STRIKE. &gt;&gt; And I'm swinging, amen, with everything that I have. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, let us be ready when you come. &gt;&gt; It's time to set things right. &gt;&gt; That's what the seventh seal is. Brother Bram said, it's the end of struggling nature. [laughter] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THAT STRUGGLE, all the wrongness, ALL THE CORRUPTION, EVERYTHING THAT JUST BOTHERS US. AMEN. THE WORD HAS COME TO SET IT ALL RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Heaven came down &gt;&gt; and opened the seven seals. The mighty angel has descended. It's the final blow and you're the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a stone in your hand. &gt;&gt; Strike your strike. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I tell you, church, Brother Bram said, I was listening to him talk about how there's an order to the rapture because he said, you know, Paul will have his people. &gt;&gt; Peter will have his people. &gt;&gt; You know what I was thinking last night as we were worshiping the Lord together? I said, Lord, maybe it's not just messenger and messenger, but I pray when I get the over there that my first reunion, Amen, is with is with the people that I eat with. &gt;&gt; Let me let me be over there with True Word Tabernacle. Let me experience that when this this love that we have from another, it'll be so unobstructed &gt;&gt; by fallen human nature. [music] &gt;&gt; We we just feel it like it should be felt. It'll be so real. Noah, I can't wait to see your face when we get over there. I can't wait. [music] Sister Gloria, I don't know where you are and we might be a big group there. So maybe we won't be just quite right next to each other, but I'll be listening for you over there. I sure will, friends. [music] Amen. And we're right at the door. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when brother Ram said that that that the [music] we already possess that physical resurrection, that means we've already got one foot into that realm. &gt;&gt; I'm ready. [music] I'm ready. There's nothing left down here for me &gt;&gt; other than to strike my blow and fight my fight. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm saying [music] even so, Lord, come. &gt;&gt; Come, Lord. Give me strength to strike [music] the final blow from my impregnable tower. Let me not leave my place of safety, &gt;&gt; but let me find my safety and security in my rest, in my tower of identification. [music] We'll close on this quote. Brother Bam said, "Do you see it?" "All creation is groaning," said Paul. [music] "Everything is groaning. Look at the trees, how they struggle. Look at the flowers, how they struggle for life, just for frost to tear him down. Look at the trees, how they struggle to hold their branches out to sing glories unto God. [music] Everything, all nature, all animals, all birds, how he flies from the enemy quickly and gets away. Everything is groaning. And we ourselves, said Paul, [music] we groan for we're waiting for the redemption of our body. [music] But brother Rah say, but now now they did all those years until now. [music] Now now we have the earnest of our inheritance. We have the evidence that God lives. How could you how could you have been there last night and not say we have the evidence that God is with us? Yeah, &gt;&gt; he has not forsaken us. We are his. He is ours &gt;&gt; because we in our bodies now tabernacle [music] the Holy Spirit of God that cries out, "Aba, Father." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing [music] can ever take that away. &gt;&gt; We are anchored in Christ. &gt;&gt; God bless you. There'll [singing] be no war. [music] There'll be no [singing] pain. [music] Come [singing] Jesus, come.

There was more than just the mechanics here this weekend. You, the dynamic one, came on the scene and Father, Lord, this is [music] a reality. Lord, this is something that's beyond human reasoning. Father, I thank you for every messenger [music] of every age. God, they had a part, a part of the kingdom. But Lord, we're living in the end time, Lord, where the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Christ. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Father, it seems like it can't be much further down the road. [music] I even believe at my age, I can still see it. It could be that close. Lord, bless these three young men, Lord God. I pray you bless them. [music] thinking about brother Ronnie and telling about the the migraine he had all night. [music] There's a price to pay, Lord, under the nervous tension and the stress of ministering. I pray you bring healing to this congregation, whoever is sick and afflicted.

We give you the praise and we give you the honor and we give you the glory. [music] We love you with all our hearts in Jesus name. [music] Amen. God bless you as you go shake hands with one another.
