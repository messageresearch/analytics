[10:26] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[10:31] greater than you.
[10:47] I want each one of you to give me your
[10:50] undivided attention.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; And listen close. Now we're trying to go
[10:56] in for the greatest victory of the
[10:59] meeting.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; This is the last night. Usually there's
[11:04] more people healed on the last night
[11:05] there is the rest of the meeting. The
[11:07] great anticipation. Satan fights harder.
[11:11] everything goes wrong seemingly because
[11:13] Satan is trying to keep that people in
[11:17] tension and everything else so that he
[11:19] can keep them away from this great time
[11:22] of strain that we're now entering into
[11:25] for the great as we say going in for the
[11:27] kill now. He's already beat up in the
[11:30] corner. He's been exposed and all of his
[11:33] divisiveness is exposed and men and
[11:36] women has accepted Jesus Christ as their
[11:39] savior. people with cancer and tumors
[11:41] and and everything else has been healed.
[11:45] Doctor statements proving that it's the
[11:47] truth. Now, here sets a group of people
[11:49] here tonight sitting waiting under great
[11:51] anticipation. And Satan, if he can
[11:54] interrupt your mind, that's all he has
[11:56] to do. But let's go in now for the great
[11:59] kill just now to drive Satan and all
[12:02] these powers out of the building that
[12:04] God can have the right away and heal
[12:07] every sick person for the glory of God.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tonight, uh we're looking forward
[12:18] to what the Lord has in store.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; At the end of the service, uh will be
[12:23] our prayer line. We feel led to have a
[12:26] prayer line tonight. You might say,
[12:28] "Brother Nathan, you say you feel led,
[12:29] but isn't there a prayer line every
[12:32] year, every Saturday night?" Well, we
[12:35] feel led by Mark chapter 16,
[12:38] &gt;&gt; where the word says that these signs
[12:40] shall follow them that believe. They
[12:42] shall cast out devils. They shall lay
[12:45] hands on the sick, and they shall
[12:47] recover. We believe that the quickening
[12:50] power is not just something that fell
[12:52] 2,000 years ago on the day of Pentecost,
[12:55] &gt;&gt; but that same quickening power is in
[12:57] every manifested son or daughter of God.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and life can be imparted
[13:05] because of that quickening power which
[13:08] quickens even these mortal bodies.
[13:11] Satan uh is certainly trying to
[13:13] interrupt this meeting. Uh we're going
[13:16] to go to prayer just after this and one
[13:18] of the prayer requests is three young
[13:20] people that are campers here that were
[13:21] in a car accident and by the grace of
[13:24] God other than a couple broken bones um
[13:26] they're alive and well and recovering.
[13:29] But um but uh you know what Satan is
[13:33] trying to do is distract us
[13:36] &gt;&gt; from realizing that he's already
[13:38] defeated.
[13:40] Brother Brandham said, "We are disputing
[13:42] with a conquered enemy, a defeated
[13:44] enemy."
[13:45] &gt;&gt; It's not that we don't dispute,
[13:47] &gt;&gt; it's just that he's defeated.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; You know, it's time tonight to go in for
[13:52] the kill.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Uh if if if at this point in the
[13:56] meeting, you've not already received
[13:58] what it is uh that you came to camp
[14:01] crying out for, you know, uh what's been
[14:04] happening as the word has been preached.
[14:05] We so appreciate the ministry that we've
[14:07] had. uh you know by this ministry an
[14:10] opportunity has been presented a key has
[14:13] been placed in your hand and with all of
[14:15] the ministry of the word faith has been
[14:17] building in these hearts because that's
[14:19] the very source of faith faith comes by
[14:22] hearing of the word and as the word is
[14:24] preached tonight only believe it
[14:28] &gt;&gt; only believe it
[14:30] &gt;&gt; let's not become distracted tonight it's
[14:32] simple faith in the word of God the
[14:34] right mental attitude toward every
[14:36] promise can heal every sick person here.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; It can heal your body.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; It can heal your spirit.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; And it can heal a sin sick soul.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; How many are in that great anticipation?
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we just ask uh when the times
[14:52] come when the time comes for the prayer
[14:54] line, we just come in a clockwise
[14:56] fashion around the building. brothers
[14:58] will be lined up here uh to pray and and
[15:01] we just ask that uh you just move
[15:03] efficiently and re and respectfully as
[15:05] our deacons and the brothers and sisters
[15:07] that that uh we we've put we've put a
[15:11] little group together to just to
[15:12] facilitate things just be reverent and
[15:16] come through and come in faith. Amen.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh in God perfecting his
[15:22] church, Brother Bram says, "Gathered
[15:23] around you, standing behind you, around
[15:26] your side, is spiritfilled men and women
[15:30] &gt;&gt; with hands to lay upon you." Brother
[15:32] Bram said as we pray together, be
[15:35] determined.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Don't be defeated.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; You can't be defeated.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; You're children of God.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; God promised the Holy Spirit to every
[15:45] believer.
[15:47] How many desiring the baptism of the
[15:50] Holy Ghost, a rebaptism of the Holy
[15:52] Ghost, the moving of the spirit. He
[15:54] promised it to every believer. And
[15:56] Brother Brham said, "He wants to give it
[15:58] to you more than you want to receive
[16:00] it."
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I was struck by how Brother Brham
[16:05] says it. He said, "Now, don't tell them
[16:08] how you want to get it.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Tell them you want it.
[16:23] You know, if there's a young person
[16:24] that's here tonight under the pressure
[16:28] of of of trying to
[16:31] experience something that's going to
[16:33] match somebody else's experience
[16:35] &gt;&gt; on that quote right there, just put that
[16:37] aside.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I want my experience,
[16:40] &gt;&gt; my own experience." He said, he said,
[16:43] just tell him you want it and no matter
[16:45] how it comes, you want it.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; You want something to anchor your heart
[16:49] and soul away till all doubts and fears
[16:52] will pass away and joy bells of heaven
[16:55] will ring through your soul. God will
[16:58] take care of the rest of it. You just
[17:00] ask him to give you the baptism of the
[17:03] Holy Spirit.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many got faith tonight? Amen.
[17:07] Let's have church.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we we just open in a word of
[17:12] prayer. We appreciate these men of God
[17:15] uh that have uh uh just come to support
[17:17] the meeting. Brother Matthew, would you
[17:19] come and and uh pray for us tonight?
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Remember those three kids.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord Jesus, we
[17:29] we're just so honored to be gathered
[17:31] together once again this evening, Lord,
[17:33] and to know that we're in your presence
[17:35] and that you are here present with us,
[17:37] Lord. And
[17:40] just as we've heard the prophet's voice
[17:42] and seen the hands of these young people
[17:44] going up for the baptism of the Holy
[17:46] Ghost and for a refilling,
[17:49] Lord, I believe that we're standing
[17:51] right now in a predestinated moment
[17:54] where you knew that this would be the
[17:56] night that demon spirits would be cast
[17:59] out, that bodies would be healed, and
[18:01] those would be filled with the Holy
[18:03] Ghost. Lord, and I'm just smitten in my
[18:06] heart to know that you're the same
[18:08] yesterday, today, and forever. And what
[18:10] you did for me, Lord, that you're going
[18:12] to do for these young ones that have
[18:14] lifted their hands, Lord. And the
[18:16] questions will be answered, and the the
[18:18] spirit of fear and anxiety and
[18:20] depression and and lust and bondage and
[18:23] all those things will be defeated as you
[18:24] defeated everything at Calvary, Lord.
[18:27] For you are the mighty conqueror and
[18:28] you're here present with us right now to
[18:31] manifest your promised word, Lord. and
[18:33] we just want to tell you that we love
[18:34] you and we thank you, Lord. Thank you
[18:36] for making this possible, that we could
[18:38] come together, Lord. Thank you for
[18:40] Calvary. Thank you for the forgiveness
[18:41] of sins, Lord. Where would we be if it
[18:44] wasn't for your grace and for your
[18:45] mercy, Lord, that would reach down and
[18:47] pluck us out of the muck and mire of
[18:49] sin, Lord? And you'd raise us up,
[18:51] Father, and to heavenly places in Christ
[18:54] Jesus where all things are possible to
[18:56] them that believe, Lord. What an hour,
[18:58] what a moment that we now sit in, Lord.
[19:00] And I we bind our faith together, Lord,
[19:03] casting down uh reasoning and casting
[19:06] down doubt and every demon of darkness
[19:07] that would try to hinder and disrupt the
[19:10] move of the Holy Spirit in this meeting.
[19:12] Lord, we think of these three young
[19:13] people in the accident and those things
[19:15] that have happened. May your Holy Ghost
[19:17] just go to them right now. Bring
[19:18] comfort, Lord. And may you just drive
[19:20] away any fear and anxiety and and maybe
[19:23] the driver right now is just uh the
[19:25] enemy is trying to bombard the thought
[19:27] and the mind and discourage them. I
[19:29] rebuke that spirit. May they just be
[19:31] encouraged to know that you are with
[19:33] them and that you will get the victory
[19:35] and they will get the victory and we'll
[19:37] all be victorious. And we know that
[19:38] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[19:41] world, Lord. So now we surrender to you,
[19:44] Lord, as we continue to sing songs of
[19:47] worship and praise. May you just prepare
[19:49] our hearts, Lord, and be with the
[19:51] ministering of the word, Father, as we
[19:52] are in a great expectations. And we
[19:55] know, Father, that you will exceed those
[19:57] expectations. We love you. We pray and
[19:59] ask these things in your most wonderful,
[20:01] marvelous name, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[20:04] Amen. Amen.

[52:11] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[52:17] are.
[52:20] Lord I worship you because of who you
[52:26] are. You can just raise your hands to
[52:28] the Lord you Lord I worship you because
[52:34] of who you are. He's the reason.
[52:41] He's the reason we're praising his name
[52:43] tonight. because of who you are.
[52:52] Amen. How many can give him a hand clap
[52:54] of praise tonight?
[52:56] And how many believes he's worthy to be
[52:58] praised?
[52:59] How many believes he's worthy to be
[53:01] worshiped tonight? How many's come to
[53:04] break open the alabaster box and pour
[53:06] all the ointment out upon his feet
[53:08] tonight? Amen. We didn't come here to
[53:10] hold anything back tonight. Amen. But we
[53:13] came here for one motive and one
[53:14] objective and one purpose and that's to
[53:17] worship him. Let's listen to the words
[53:19] of that song as we were singing it.
[53:21] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[53:24] are. My mind went back to a story I read
[53:27] one time of a man that was in a room and
[53:29] the president of the United States back
[53:31] in the 1800s walked in the room and when
[53:34] he walked in there, the man got up out
[53:36] of his seat and he said, "Here, you can
[53:38] have my seat." And somebody asked him,
[53:40] they said, "Why did you get up?" He said
[53:42] because it's the president and he just
[53:44] stepped in the room. See, he who he was
[53:47] demanded that seat. And you know
[53:50] tonight, I believe our Lord Jesus Christ
[53:52] is not a demanding God, but I believe
[53:54] he's a loving God. And I believe he
[53:57] loves us enough that he stepped down in
[53:58] this building tonight. Amen. I think
[54:01] it's time for complexes to get out of
[54:02] his seat.
[54:04] I think it's time for anxiety and
[54:06] nervousness and tension and fear and
[54:08] unbelief and doubt and worry about
[54:11] praising God. I believe it's time for
[54:12] all those things to get up out of his
[54:14] seat. They don't belong in that seat.
[54:16] But the King of Kings and the Lord of
[54:18] Lords, the Savior of belongs in our
[54:21] heart tonight. And we've come here to do
[54:23] one thing, and that is to worship him in
[54:26] spirit and in truth. Amen. God bless you
[54:29] all tonight. It's such an honor to be
[54:31] here with you and we want to bring you
[54:32] greetings from our pastor, brother Matt
[54:34] Morris and the saints there at home at
[54:36] our church in Grace Tabernacle in Black
[54:38] Rock, Arkansas send their greetings. I
[54:40] know there's many, many of the believers
[54:42] from our church here with us this
[54:43] weekend. And we are sure honored to have
[54:45] all them here and also want to say it's
[54:47] an honor to have my wife and our family
[54:49] here with us tonight. I know they're in
[54:51] the building somewhere and amen, we're
[54:53] sure thankful to have them here tonight.
[54:56] And how many's been enjoying the
[54:57] meetings? Amen. How many's the Lord
[55:00] already spoken to you? Amen. The Lord is
[55:02] doing powerful things among us and we we
[55:05] thank him for it tonight. We we praise
[55:08] his holy name. I I do want to take this
[55:10] moment for just a moment and thank
[55:12] brother Wayne for the opportunity to be
[55:14] here tonight and to speak to you. And
[55:16] Amen. I I want to maybe just say tonight
[55:18] how much I love and appreciate Brother
[55:20] Wayne and the ministry that God's given
[55:22] and the stand for this message. I I'll
[55:25] just share this. I was a 15year-old boy
[55:27] the first time I met Brother Wayne and
[55:29] we I'd gone to a meeting and amen I'll
[55:32] just share this with you tonight. I'd
[55:33] gone to a meeting and on the way there
[55:35] someone told me I'd never heard of
[55:36] Brother Wayne, never heard him minister
[55:38] and be my first time and was got there
[55:41] and a brother told me he said, "Oh, he's
[55:43] one of them preachers, you know, he
[55:44] won't have no time for you." And he
[55:46] said, "You won't get to meet him." And I
[55:48] thought, man, people just say a lot of
[55:49] things, don't they? And the end of the
[55:50] meeting, I was sitting at the table. And
[55:53] brother Wayne and his son Zach came over
[55:55] and sat with me there and began to
[55:56] fellowship with me and didn't know me
[55:58] from anybody. And I was a young man
[56:01] filmed the call of God to preach. And
[56:03] Brother Wayne showed Christ to me and
[56:05] showed me a love for this message. And I
[56:07] can say he's been a real friend to me.
[56:09] His family's been a real friend. They've
[56:11] been like family to us. And I want to
[56:13] say tonight, Brother Wayne, thank you
[56:15] for your stand for this message.
[56:17] Thank you for all the years you carried
[56:18] this message around the world and held
[56:21] it up high for God's people. Amen. It
[56:23] wasn't without sacrifice, friends. And
[56:26] we thank God for the men of God and the
[56:27] ministry that God has given brother
[56:30] brother Wayne and the church here. And I
[56:32] tell you, he lives and breathes this
[56:33] message. And Amen. If there's any
[56:35] question what brother Wayne believes,
[56:36] you know, he believes this message.
[56:38] Amen. There's no room for anything else.
[56:40] And we thank you as young people. We
[56:42] thank you for your stand for this
[56:43] message. And of course through brother
[56:45] Wayne, we met Brother Ray and the church
[56:47] here. And Amen. We sure love and
[56:49] appreciate Brother Ray, don't we? Amen.
[56:51] How many can give the Lord a hand clap
[56:52] of praise for the man of God many, many
[56:56] years standing for this word. And you
[56:58] can see the reflection of it in his
[57:00] life, in his family, and his in his
[57:02] conversation. Amen. I thank God for
[57:05] Brother Ray. And it's a real honor to be
[57:07] speaking with brother Josh Bennett this
[57:09] evening and this weekend. and he's been
[57:11] a real friend to us and another um
[57:13] brother I met through brother Wayne and
[57:15] just a real friend and to stand for this
[57:16] message and amen I tell you you don't
[57:18] forget men of God that the Lord puts in
[57:21] your life and there's one thing I can
[57:22] say these brothers have never told me
[57:24] anything but this preach the message
[57:27] amen and we thank you brother Josh for
[57:28] your stand for this word and all the men
[57:30] of God here tonight we just want to say
[57:32] God bless you and we pray I know there's
[57:34] preachers all over the building we pray
[57:36] the Lord's richest blessings upon your
[57:38] ministries and that God use you to tear
[57:40] down the devil's kingdom. Every chance
[57:42] you get, may you preach this message
[57:44] without any fear or favor or any
[57:46] compromise and tear down the devil's
[57:48] kingdom. And amen, we say God bless you
[57:50] also, Brother Nathan, Brother Ronnie.
[57:52] Amen. God bless you all for your vision,
[57:54] for your burden in these meetings. How
[57:56] many can give the Lord a hand clap of
[57:57] praise for men of God like brother
[57:59] Nathan Ericson, Brother Ronnie Long.
[58:02] Amen. All the helpers and supports that
[58:04] goes into these meetings. Amen. We thank
[58:06] you for giving your time and efforts to
[58:09] hold up the message and to prepare a
[58:11] place that the message can be preached.
[58:12] We sure love brother Nathan and brother
[58:14] Ronnie tonight. And amen. I I just want
[58:16] to just take a moment. Sometimes we get
[58:18] to preaching and don't take a moment to
[58:20] express our thanksgiving and gratitude
[58:22] for the men of God that have made it
[58:24] possible for us to be here tonight. How
[58:26] many wants to approach him tonight?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Maybe we just bow our hearts for a word
[58:30] of prayer. How many would say, 'Lord, I
[58:32] know the enemy is raging on every hand,
[58:34] but I know the situation's under
[58:36] control. The Holy Spirit is already in
[58:39] control. Let's just approach him.
[58:41] Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come before
[58:43] you tonight, dear God, with a whole
[58:46] house full of believers, Lord, young
[58:48] believers, elder believers, Lord,
[58:50] ministers, Father, Lord, in an
[58:52] atmosphere like this with this much
[58:54] faith, Lord, there is one thing that I
[58:56] am confident in my heart tonight that
[58:59] all things are possible in this building
[59:01] tonight. Lord, I know the devil's doing
[59:03] everything he can to bring tension and
[59:05] to hinder, but Lord, we stand here upon
[59:08] the infallibility of your word. And
[59:10] Lord, we join our faith together
[59:12] tonight. Believe in the promises of your
[59:14] word to be thus saith the Lord. Now
[59:16] Lord, we have been instructed by your
[59:18] prophet messenger that the bride will
[59:20] not make a move until she has thus
[59:22] sayaeth the Lord. Now Father, we're not
[59:25] presuming tonight. We're not adventuring
[59:27] without authority. But Lord, we have set
[59:30] still and heard that still small voice
[59:32] speak to us through this message. Thus
[59:34] sayaith the Lord, a move is on for the
[59:37] bride. Now Lord, as we're turning our
[59:39] attention to your word with an oncoming
[59:41] prayer line, Lord, I know the demons in
[59:44] hell are screaming, the streaks of
[59:45] blackness are moving across this
[59:47] building. But Lord, we're standing here
[59:49] knowing that you have never stepped into
[59:51] the arena one time into battle, but what
[59:54] you've carried out the victory. And
[59:56] Lord, I know there's many young hearts
[59:58] here tonight. Lord, there's many lives
[1:00:00] and believers here, Father, that are
[1:00:02] going through things and situations. But
[1:00:04] I just want to put my voice tonight,
[1:00:06] Lord, with your word. It is finished,
[1:00:09] Lord. Father, may this be the night that
[1:00:11] faith would arise in their heart, oh
[1:00:13] God. Lord, to step out of the
[1:00:15] confusions, to step out of the
[1:00:17] nervousness, Lord. Father, may this be
[1:00:19] the beginning of a breakthrough in their
[1:00:21] hearts here tonight. Lord, as your word
[1:00:23] goes forth, may it drive out every every
[1:00:25] spirit of unbelief that would be
[1:00:27] lingering in this building, dear God.
[1:00:28] May you drive it back to the hell that
[1:00:30] it come out of, Lord. Father, may you
[1:00:32] bring us into one mind and one accord.
[1:00:35] Lord, as we endeavor to open up your
[1:00:37] word, we're asking you to send the angel
[1:00:38] of God into this building. Lord, may
[1:00:41] that super anointing sweep across this
[1:00:43] room tonight. And Lord, may we not just
[1:00:45] hold this book, but may this book become
[1:00:47] open to every heart here tonight. Lord,
[1:00:50] for those that are at home listening by
[1:00:51] the way of the internet, I pray you
[1:00:53] would touch them, dear God. Lord, for
[1:00:55] those that have been in the accident,
[1:00:56] Lord, may your grace be with them,
[1:00:58] Father. Now Lord, as we look into your
[1:01:00] word, may the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:02] destroy the influence of the enemy.
[1:01:04] Father, forgive us of our failures.
[1:01:06] Forgive us of our shortcomings. We're
[1:01:08] looking unto you for the for the word
[1:01:11] that'll be spoken here tonight, Lord, to
[1:01:13] perform that which has been sent to do.
[1:01:15] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:01:17] pray. And all the believers says,
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you tonight.
[1:01:23] If you have your Bibles, we want to go
[1:01:25] to the book of St. Mark, the 11th
[1:01:27] chapter. Amen. in St. Mark the 11th
[1:01:29] chapter. Thank you, Amen, for your
[1:01:31] patience with us tonight. St. Mark chap
[1:01:33] 11
[1:01:35] and verse number 22. Amen. It's a very
[1:01:38] familiar reading. And then also we're
[1:01:40] going to go to the book of Revelation
[1:01:43] 22.
[1:01:44] Amen. The book of St. Mark 11 and verse
[1:01:47] 22. You love the Lord tonight.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible here says in Mark 11:22,
[1:01:54] "And Jesus answering saith unto them,
[1:01:58] have faith in God. For verily I say unto
[1:02:01] you that whosoever shall look unto this
[1:02:05] mountain,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; come on now. Whosoever shall think about
[1:02:09] this mountain,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[1:02:17] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[1:02:20] heart, but shall believe, that those
[1:02:22] things which he saith shall come to
[1:02:26] pass, he shall have whatsoever
[1:02:30] he saith.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; So, it's no longer just thinking, but he
[1:02:34] actually says whatever you say. Now in
[1:02:37] the book of Revelation the 22nd chapter,
[1:02:39] Revelation chapter 22, I want to read
[1:02:43] there in the sixth verse of Revelation
[1:02:45] 22. You when you got your places there,
[1:02:49] you can say amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Revelation 22 and verse number six.
[1:02:56] And he said unto me, these sayings are
[1:02:59] faithful and true. And the Lord uh God
[1:03:02] of the holy prophets sent his angel to
[1:03:05] show unto his servants the things which
[1:03:07] must shortly be done. Behold, I come
[1:03:10] quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the
[1:03:13] sayings of the prophecy of this book.
[1:03:17] And I John saw these things and heard
[1:03:19] them. And when I had heard and seen, I
[1:03:21] fell down to worship before the feet of
[1:03:23] the angel which showed me these things.
[1:03:26] Then saith he unto me, see thou do it
[1:03:28] not, for I am of thy fellow servants,
[1:03:30] and of thy brethren the prophets, and of
[1:03:33] them which keep the sayings of this
[1:03:35] book, worship God. And he saith unto me,
[1:03:39] I love this. And he saith unto me, seal
[1:03:42] not the sayings of the prophecy of this
[1:03:45] book, for the time is at hand. Can we
[1:03:50] just read that verse together? and he
[1:03:52] saith unto me, "Seal not the sayings of
[1:03:55] the prophecy of this book, for the time
[1:03:58] is at hand." We ask the Lord this
[1:04:01] evening to bless the reading of his
[1:04:02] word. As you can have your seat here
[1:04:04] this afternoon, I I want you to by the
[1:04:06] help of the Lord for a few moments
[1:04:07] tonight, if I would title this this
[1:04:10] sermon tonight, I want to speak to you
[1:04:11] on this, the authority of the confession
[1:04:14] of the open book generation. The
[1:04:17] authority of the confession of the open
[1:04:19] book generation. I truly believe tonight
[1:04:22] that what the Bible says when it says
[1:04:24] that life and death is in the power of
[1:04:27] the tongue. How many believes that? You
[1:04:29] know the Bible says that life and death
[1:04:31] is in the power of the tongue. And I
[1:04:33] also believe that as a prophet of God
[1:04:35] would tell us that when we approach God,
[1:04:37] we've got to know how to approach God.
[1:04:40] And he said we've got to approach God by
[1:04:42] saying the right thing. When you look
[1:04:44] there at that word approach, it means to
[1:04:46] draw closer to. It is a means of access.
[1:04:49] It means to approach. Now this is what I
[1:04:52] want you to notice especially in order
[1:04:54] to create a desired result. So when you
[1:04:58] approach something you are desiring a
[1:05:00] specific result and the only way that
[1:05:02] can happen is by the way you approach it
[1:05:04] has the power of creation to create the
[1:05:08] desire that you're desiring from God.
[1:05:10] Now amen I said approach God by saying
[1:05:12] the right thing. When you look there at
[1:05:14] that word saying I love this definition.
[1:05:17] It is a short collection of forceful
[1:05:19] expressions that generally contain
[1:05:22] truth, instruction, advice, and wisdom.
[1:05:25] Amen. A saying contains truth,
[1:05:28] instruction, advice, and wisdom. It's
[1:05:30] not something that's weak. It's not
[1:05:32] something that's powerless, but it's
[1:05:34] something that's forceful when it's
[1:05:36] said. It has something behind it. Now,
[1:05:39] amen. We've all heard someone say,
[1:05:41] "Amen." Sometime in our life, they'll
[1:05:43] say, "Well, amen. There's an old saying
[1:05:45] like I heard an old saying or somebody
[1:05:47] will say here's an old saying and what
[1:05:48] we find is actually the prophet of God
[1:05:50] will show us that actually sayings amen
[1:05:53] have been passed down from one
[1:05:55] generation to the next generation to the
[1:05:57] next generation and what they have
[1:05:59] become is they have become standards
[1:06:01] amen in which people are living by.
[1:06:03] Brother Brandimal he'll give us several
[1:06:04] of them he'll say like my mother used to
[1:06:06] say your tongue is your ruin or she
[1:06:09] would say you're crossing bridges before
[1:06:10] you get to them. She would say, "Show me
[1:06:12] your company and I'll tell you who you
[1:06:14] are." He said, "Mama would say birds of
[1:06:16] a feather flock together." He said, "One
[1:06:18] time she said if you lay down with a dog
[1:06:20] that's got fleas, you're going to get up
[1:06:22] with fleas." He He said she would say,
[1:06:24] "Give the cow enough rope and she'll
[1:06:25] hang herself." Or he said, "Like I've
[1:06:27] heard it said, "Live me a sermon is
[1:06:29] better than preaching me one." Or he
[1:06:31] said, "Like you folks from Missouri, you
[1:06:32] have an old saying, show me." Amen.
[1:06:35] Because seeing is believing. He said,
[1:06:37] "Then there's that one saying, "Cowards
[1:06:39] die a million times." Amen. When heroes
[1:06:42] never die, he said, "Then they got one
[1:06:44] other saying. They'll say truth is more
[1:06:46] strange than fiction." Now, amen. I want
[1:06:48] you to notice something that brother
[1:06:49] Brandham, Amen, did not come up with
[1:06:51] those. Amen. But rather, those were
[1:06:53] sayings and phrases that had been passed
[1:06:55] down. Amen. From one generation to the
[1:06:58] next. And people had made decisions by
[1:07:01] those phrases. People, amen, had had
[1:07:03] changed destinies by those phrases. I I
[1:07:06] want to say tonight that saints, amen,
[1:07:08] are more, amen, than just praises. But
[1:07:10] saints are powerful. And I think we
[1:07:12] ought to let the Holy Ghost come in this
[1:07:14] building tonight. Amen. And take control
[1:07:16] of our thoughts in order to speak, amen,
[1:07:19] out of us the things that we have need
[1:07:21] of. When you look in Mark 11:22 in the
[1:07:24] Amplified Bible, the Bible says that
[1:07:26] Jesus replied and he said, "Have faith
[1:07:29] in God constantly." Amen. I love that.
[1:07:32] Don't have faith when things are going
[1:07:33] good. Don't don't have faith when things
[1:07:35] are really high. Amen. But in the
[1:07:37] darkest of hours is the time, amen, to
[1:07:40] have faith. Have faith in God
[1:07:42] constantly. And verse 23, I assure you
[1:07:45] and most solemnly say to you that
[1:07:48] whosoever says to this mountain, amen,
[1:07:51] be lifted up and thrown into the sea and
[1:07:54] does not doubt in his heart, Brother
[1:07:56] said, he said, now watch. He said his
[1:07:58] will is his word, right? He said, does
[1:08:01] not doubt in his heart. Listen, in God's
[1:08:04] unlimited power, Amen. But believes that
[1:08:07] what he says is going to take place.
[1:08:10] Amen. If you don't believe what you say
[1:08:12] is going to take place, Amen. you really
[1:08:14] don't believe it. Amen. But if you
[1:08:17] really believe what you say is going to
[1:08:19] take place, that tells me that you
[1:08:21] believe what you're saying is going to
[1:08:24] come to pass before your very eyes.
[1:08:26] Amen. If you believe what you're saying
[1:08:28] is going to take place, it will be done
[1:08:31] for him. Listen, in accordance with
[1:08:34] God's will. So if God does something,
[1:08:36] it's going to be done in accordance with
[1:08:39] his will. In the token, he said, "Let me
[1:08:41] tell you, by his word, he cannot go
[1:08:44] contrary to that word." He has already
[1:08:47] purchased your desire if it's according
[1:08:50] to his will. That ought to make you
[1:08:52] shout, "Hallelujah." Amen. God has
[1:08:54] already purchased your desire if it's
[1:08:57] according to his will. If you're
[1:09:00] desiring the Holy Ghost, it already
[1:09:02] belongs to you. If you're desiring
[1:09:05] healing, it already belongs to you. If
[1:09:08] you're desiring the power of God to fill
[1:09:10] your life, it already belongs to you.
[1:09:13] His will is to give you his desire.
[1:09:17] Amen. I say tonight, we're not
[1:09:18] approaching God, amen, as a
[1:09:20] denomination. We're we're not
[1:09:22] approaching God as just church members,
[1:09:24] but we're approaching God as the new
[1:09:26] generation. Amen. And I'll say this
[1:09:29] approach is everything. Amen. There is a
[1:09:31] right approach and there is a wrong
[1:09:34] approach. Brother said a man walk out
[1:09:36] and say I'll show you I can move that
[1:09:38] mountain. Mountain be moved. He said and
[1:09:40] it doesn't happen. He said it certainly
[1:09:43] won't because your motive and your
[1:09:45] objective is not right. Amen. So there's
[1:09:48] a connection, amen, between our approach
[1:09:51] and what we say. In the message approach
[1:09:53] to God, he said God has a way of
[1:09:56] approach. He said, "There's a way you
[1:09:58] approach a king." He said, "The boy that
[1:10:00] wants to approach the young lady." Amen.
[1:10:02] There's a certain approach. He said,
[1:10:04] "You just can't come up there and say,
[1:10:07] "Hey there, like to meet you and shake
[1:10:09] your hand. She isn't very much of a
[1:10:12] lady. She'll let you know where to get
[1:10:13] on and where to get off at." He said,
[1:10:15] "There's a certain approach." He said,
[1:10:17] "And there's approach to all things." He
[1:10:20] said, "And there's a way to approach
[1:10:22] God. And if we don't know the approach
[1:10:24] to God, then we'll never be able to get
[1:10:27] an audience with God. Amen. See, you
[1:10:30] have to know. Amen. So, you got to know
[1:10:32] the approach in order to get the result
[1:10:36] of an audience with the one that you're
[1:10:38] approaching. He said, in a court, you
[1:10:40] don't just walk up there and say, "Hey,
[1:10:42] judge." Amen. I want to talk to you a
[1:10:43] little bit. Amen. Somebody throw you out
[1:10:45] of the courtroom. They'll lock you up.
[1:10:47] See? Amen. There's a way to approach the
[1:10:49] judge. Amen. If there's a way to
[1:10:51] approach a young lady, if there's a way
[1:10:54] to approach a judge, he said, then we
[1:10:56] must find the way of approach to the
[1:10:58] great divine judge, which is God
[1:11:01] himself. Listen, I want to tell you
[1:11:03] tonight, young people. Amen. We don't
[1:11:05] approach God under fear. Amen. We
[1:11:08] approach God under faith. And I'll tell
[1:11:10] you what the prophet said. He said,
[1:11:12] "Faith is a revelation and a revelation
[1:11:16] of the will of God." Can I say this to
[1:11:19] you? Fear. Amen. Will bind you. Amen.
[1:11:22] But faith will loose you. Amen. Fear
[1:11:24] will control you. Amen. But faith, Amen,
[1:11:27] will release you and give you a place to
[1:11:30] stand upon the word of God. He said
[1:11:33] faith is not loose. It's got to be based
[1:11:35] upon some noted fact. You got to know
[1:11:38] something about what you're having faith
[1:11:39] in before you can have faith in it. So,
[1:11:42] we first must know how and what God's
[1:11:45] desire is and what God's plan is and how
[1:11:49] to approach God by that plan. Listen,
[1:11:52] we're not a bunch of Pentecostals, amen,
[1:11:54] trying to work up an approach to God. We
[1:11:57] have had a prophet come in this
[1:11:58] generation and he opened up the Bible
[1:12:01] and he said, "God's plan is laid out in
[1:12:04] his Bible."
[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:07] You know that if the Holy Spirit would
[1:12:09] come in this building tonight and would
[1:12:10] begin to teach anything, he said it'll
[1:12:13] be right out of that Bible. He said,
[1:12:15] "That's the kind of tutor we got." Amen.
[1:12:17] The Holy Spirit to reveal and to bring
[1:12:20] the discipline book of the father and
[1:12:22] reveal to you what God's plan is. And
[1:12:25] there is no scripture in the Bible that
[1:12:28] contradicts itself. Listen, there's no
[1:12:30] scripture in the Bible that contradicts
[1:12:33] itself. Amen. I just picked that up.
[1:12:35] Amen. Matthew 28 says, "Be baptized in
[1:12:38] the name of Father, Son, and Holy
[1:12:40] Ghost." Amen. Then in Acts 2, it said,
[1:12:43] "Repent of your sins and be baptized in
[1:12:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." And
[1:12:47] a bunch of unconverted, uninspired
[1:12:49] leadership took two scriptures and made
[1:12:52] them begin to fight with each other. And
[1:12:54] now people don't know how to baptize. Do
[1:12:56] you know that same spirit has come right
[1:12:58] around the ranks of this message? And we
[1:13:00] got quotes like this. The church needs
[1:13:03] to get out of order long enough to get
[1:13:04] saved. And then we got quotes that
[1:13:06] emotion without anything without emotion
[1:13:08] is dead. But then you got other quotes.
[1:13:11] Amen. That the anointing is supreme
[1:13:12] power and control. And I just got enough
[1:13:14] guts to say it. A bunch of intellectual
[1:13:17] uninspired men have made a cage out of
[1:13:20] quotes to put you in, to bind you from
[1:13:22] praising God, to bind you from enjoying
[1:13:25] your liberty, to bind you from the Holy
[1:13:27] Ghost. But I stand here tonight upon the
[1:13:30] authority of thus sayaith the Lord. This
[1:13:33] message is not a cage. This message is
[1:13:36] liberty. It's Holy Ghost liberty. It's
[1:13:39] fire power. It's the dynamics of God to
[1:13:42] release you from the confusion of what
[1:13:44] men have said about the plan of God.
[1:13:48] This Bible don't contradict itself and
[1:13:51] this message don't either.
[1:13:54] This Bible don't contradict itself and
[1:13:56] this message don't either. You know
[1:13:58] where the contradiction comes from is
[1:14:00] because it contradicts the way they
[1:14:02] believe it. They believe this ought to
[1:14:05] be a polished message. They believe this
[1:14:07] ought to be an intellectual message.
[1:14:09] They believe this ought to be a quiet
[1:14:11] church. They believe we ought to
[1:14:14] believe we ought to just practice
[1:14:15] psychology. But let me tell you what the
[1:14:17] prophet believed. He believed in the
[1:14:19] Bible, Holy Ghost, and the power of God
[1:14:22] coming in the church. Amen. Stepping
[1:14:24] from the word of God and delivering the
[1:14:26] children of God.
[1:14:29] This message is not a contradiction.
[1:14:32] Brother said, "You got to throw away
[1:14:34] your ideas about it and you've got to
[1:14:36] accept God's plan of it. And it'll be
[1:14:38] more than just a suggestion. It'll be
[1:14:41] God's provided plan." Well, I know
[1:14:43] you're going to think I'm crazy, so go
[1:14:45] ahead, start faking it. Amen. Some of
[1:14:47] y'all paid camp fees, got in airplanes,
[1:14:49] and got in cars and drove hours to this
[1:14:52] meeting to enjoy the presence of God.
[1:14:54] You've been looking forward to getting
[1:14:56] free and enjoying the blessings of God.
[1:14:58] And there's an old devil has crept its
[1:15:01] way around and said, "Don't shout. You
[1:15:03] might get out of order and don't dance.
[1:15:05] Somebody might say something and don't
[1:15:07] shout." Amen. Cuz you might get in the
[1:15:09] flesh. Well, listen. You got the wrong
[1:15:11] joker up here tonight. I rebuke that
[1:15:13] devil in the name of Jesus Christ. This
[1:15:16] ain't a funeral parlor. This ain't a
[1:15:18] procession of death. This is a
[1:15:20] resurrection of the life of God coming
[1:15:23] in this new generation. We ain't backing
[1:15:26] up. We ain't laying down. What confused
[1:15:28] others will not confuse this age. We
[1:15:31] know who we are. The book has come open.
[1:15:37] I do not believe in any creed. I don't
[1:15:39] believe in any dogma. I don't believe
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:47] I believe the literal word of God is
[1:15:49] God's plan. You say, "What is that
[1:15:52] word?" That word's our daily bread.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread
[1:15:56] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[1:16:00] out of the mouth of God." Brother said,
[1:16:02] "The bread we need is the Bible."
[1:16:05] Well, let's just punch that devil's
[1:16:06] square in the face that says the message
[1:16:09] replaces the Bible. That is a lying
[1:16:11] spirit from the pits of hell. And any
[1:16:14] devil tries to tell you that, stand up
[1:16:16] on the word of God and put that devil in
[1:16:18] his place. This message ain't out of the
[1:16:20] Bible. It is the Bible. It is the word
[1:16:24] of God. It is the revelation of Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ under this generation.
[1:16:32] This Bible didn't get weakened down by
[1:16:34] this message. This Bible got powerful by
[1:16:36] this message. And I'll just tell you
[1:16:38] this. Amen. Denomination weaken the
[1:16:40] Bible. Traditions weaken the Bible.
[1:16:43] Creeds weaken the Bible. Amen.
[1:16:45] Intellectual ideas weaken the Bible. But
[1:16:48] this message, Amen, gave its back its
[1:16:50] full strength and its full power and
[1:16:52] it's full authority. Listen, this is not
[1:16:55] a meeting of a bunch of cultish young
[1:16:57] people gathered up here in Ohio. This is
[1:17:00] a Bible meeting. Let me say to you
[1:17:02] tonight, amen. Bible days are not
[1:17:04] coming. Bible days are here. The Holy
[1:17:07] Ghost is not on his way. The Holy Ghost
[1:17:09] is here. and any devil that tries to
[1:17:12] bind the liberty of the spirit of God
[1:17:14] from moving in the church of God. I
[1:17:16] rebuke you Satan in the name of Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ. I rebuke anxiety. I rebuke
[1:17:22] nervousness. I rebuke fear. I rebuke
[1:17:25] unbelief. I rebuke websites. I rebuke it
[1:17:28] all in the name of Jesus Christ. That's
[1:17:31] the word of God. I find a power and a
[1:17:33] liberty in the church of God.
[1:17:36] We ain't a bunch of crazy people. We
[1:17:38] ain't a bunch of cultist people. Brother
[1:17:40] Wayne, we're Holy Ghost filled, fire
[1:17:42] baptized, Malachi for following, cloud
[1:17:46] following, sons and daughters of God.
[1:17:48] And if anybody got a right toe shout and
[1:17:51] if anybody got a right to dance is the
[1:17:53] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:56] [Applause]
[1:17:58] This ain't a bunch of emotion. This is
[1:18:00] revelation.
[1:18:03] This is the Bible. This is what they
[1:18:06] done in the Bible. They preached the
[1:18:09] word and people back the word.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "What is the Bible?" He
[1:18:16] said, "It's the thoughts that God had
[1:18:18] before the foundation of the world.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; He expressed them in word and he dropped
[1:18:24] them down to prophets and they wrote
[1:18:26] them and the only thing it is it just
[1:18:29] has to unfold." He said, "Do you see the
[1:18:33] Bible was really written before the
[1:18:36] foundation of the world?"
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Then this Bible is not a
[1:18:42] historical book. It's not just an idea
[1:18:45] of a day gone by. But this Bible is a
[1:18:48] love story. It is a history book. It is
[1:18:52] a prophetic book. It's not a man's book.
[1:18:56] Brother Judah, it's God's book. And I'll
[1:18:59] say this, one over the age we're living
[1:19:01] in, my I might as well just make that
[1:19:03] devil feel uncomfortable.
[1:19:06] He's made some of you all feel
[1:19:07] uncomfortable. Amen. Why don't we make
[1:19:09] him feel uncomfortable? He ain't welcome
[1:19:11] here. He ain't welcome in this building.
[1:19:13] He ain't welcome on this platform. He
[1:19:15] ain't welcome in our singing. He ain't
[1:19:17] welcome in our praying. Somebody open
[1:19:19] the door and show that devil the exit.
[1:19:22] He is not welcome in TWT camp. This is a
[1:19:26] Holy Ghost fililled dynamic moving
[1:19:28] church of the living God who will not
[1:19:31] lay down for some intellectual
[1:19:32] conception of who her God is.
[1:19:37] We got 900 and some different
[1:19:39] denominations and each one each
[1:19:41] denomination has their own statement of
[1:19:44] faith. But I say thank God for a prophet
[1:19:47] who gave the bride church a universally
[1:19:51] beautiful statement of faith. We all got
[1:19:53] the same statement of faith. You know
[1:19:55] what it is? We have no creed but Christ.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; We have no law but love and we have no
[1:20:03] book but the Bible.
[1:20:06] Well, that ought to make you shout
[1:20:07] hallelujah. We have no creed but Christ.
[1:20:10] We have no law but love. And we have no
[1:20:14] book but the Bible. Brother Josh, that's
[1:20:17] what we believe. We're not a bunch of
[1:20:19] man followers. We're Bible Christians.
[1:20:22] We're sons and daughters of God who is
[1:20:24] following God in the scriptures that he
[1:20:27] sent from before the foundation of the
[1:20:30] world. The Bible is infallible the word
[1:20:33] of God. And I'll say this tonight, the
[1:20:35] bride of Christ is a Bible bride.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not a man-made bride. She's
[1:20:40] a word bride because she believes every
[1:20:44] word that's in the Bible. I know you've
[1:20:48] heard the phrases around the message for
[1:20:50] years, the open book. How many's heard
[1:20:52] that? Amen. I want to see your hands
[1:20:54] high and lifted. The open book. Or
[1:20:56] you've heard things like we are a people
[1:20:58] of the open book. You've heard Amen.
[1:21:01] You've heard sermons on the opening of
[1:21:03] the word.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you something? Those are not
[1:21:07] just phrases.
[1:21:09] Those are prophetic scriptural promises
[1:21:12] being fulfilled in the hour that you're
[1:21:14] living in. Brother Josh opened with this
[1:21:16] last night. It was already in my notes.
[1:21:18] I'm just going to say it again. The book
[1:21:20] of Revelation is a book of symbols and
[1:21:22] it's a prophetic book. So therefore, it
[1:21:25] can only be understood by a prophetic
[1:21:28] class of people. See, that's the
[1:21:30] difference in this youth group and some
[1:21:32] some Oh, God. That's the difference in
[1:21:34] this youth group and some some
[1:21:38] and some denominational Hollywood
[1:21:40] gathering of young people. I'll tell you
[1:21:42] what the difference in this meeting is
[1:21:44] and some youth for congress meeting is
[1:21:46] when you begin to preach the word, they
[1:21:48] shut up. Amen. They want the drums
[1:21:50] going. They want the music going. But
[1:21:52] you take this message in amongst a bunch
[1:21:54] of young people and you open this book
[1:21:56] and you begin to preach the dynamics of
[1:21:58] God and the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:00] Listen, you don't set this youth group
[1:22:02] up. You give her some dancing room. You
[1:22:05] don't shut the praises of the children
[1:22:07] of God up. They'll raise their voice
[1:22:09] because they have a revelation. If we
[1:22:12] hold our peace, the rocks will
[1:22:15] immediately cry out. But there ain't no
[1:22:17] rock going to take my place. Ain't no
[1:22:20] rock going to do my praising. Ain't no
[1:22:22] rock going to do my preaching. Ain't no
[1:22:24] rock going to do my shouting.
[1:22:27] I'm a part of the generation of the open
[1:22:30] book.
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:36] Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] Brother Brandham didn't bring this book.
[1:22:38] It was already here, but it was closed.
[1:22:42] Revelation 5 said it was closed. I saw
[1:22:45] on the right hand of him who sat on the
[1:22:47] throne a book and it was sealed within
[1:22:50] seven seals. Re said the book with seals
[1:22:53] will not be released until the message
[1:22:55] of the seventh angel. So we are
[1:22:58] presuming but the genuine revelation of
[1:23:01] God will be made perfect in that
[1:23:03] sounding vindicated truth. You know what
[1:23:06] John asked? He said, "Who is worthy? Who
[1:23:09] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[1:23:13] the seals thereof?" Brother said, "There
[1:23:15] was no man. There was no angel." He
[1:23:17] said, "What a book. What a book." If it
[1:23:20] was so powerful, brother, that you
[1:23:22] couldn't even look on it. And brother
[1:23:24] said, John said, "I begin to weep." He
[1:23:26] said, "Because no man was found worthy
[1:23:28] to open and to reveal the book." Brother
[1:23:31] said, notice John wept. He said he was
[1:23:33] not weeping because he was not worthy.
[1:23:37] He was weeping because if that book did
[1:23:40] not come open then brother Nathan
[1:23:42] everything would be lost.
[1:23:46] I love a prophet. He said but his crying
[1:23:49] didn't last but just a minute though.
[1:23:51] Glory to God. His crying only lasted
[1:23:55] just a minute. You know why? Because the
[1:23:57] Bible says that weeping may endure for
[1:23:59] the night, but joy is coming in the
[1:24:03] morning. And a prophet stood on a
[1:24:05] platform and said, "This is shalom. The
[1:24:08] night is over. It's a good morning
[1:24:10] message to you. The sun is up. The sun
[1:24:13] is up. The book is open."
[1:24:17] Oh, don't you weep, John. Amen. Don't
[1:24:20] you weep. Amen. Don't you weep. The book
[1:24:22] is going to be open. It was closed in
[1:24:24] Revelation 5, but in Revelation 10, I
[1:24:28] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:24:30] heaven. And he was clothed with a cloud,
[1:24:33] and a rainbow was upon his head, and his
[1:24:35] faces that were the sun, and his feet as
[1:24:38] pillars of fire, and he had in his hand
[1:24:42] a little book open. Reverend said that
[1:24:45] book is the Bible. He said, "See, the
[1:24:48] Bible that was taken out of the hand of
[1:24:50] God that was sitting on the throne." Do
[1:24:53] you all realize the Bible, Amen, was not
[1:24:56] written by human education. The Bible
[1:24:59] was written and was given by divine
[1:25:02] inspiration. Brother said, "Every word
[1:25:04] of God is written is inspiration and it
[1:25:07] books or it hooks the whole thing
[1:25:09] together. Every word in the Bible, it's
[1:25:12] the most wonderful book that was ever
[1:25:14] written. There's never a piece of
[1:25:16] literature like it ever written. It's
[1:25:19] the only book in existence. Well, glory
[1:25:22] to God. It's the only book in existence
[1:25:25] that tells you where you come from,
[1:25:28] tells you who you are, and tells you
[1:25:30] where you're going. Well, if I was the
[1:25:33] devil, I try to seal it up, too. If I
[1:25:36] was the devil, I would try to close it,
[1:25:38] too. But I want to tell that devil, too
[1:25:41] late. Too late. It's already opened.
[1:25:46] It's already open. I've already heard my
[1:25:51] name in the lamb's book of life. I've
[1:25:54] already heard from my theophony. Devil,
[1:25:58] you can't close it. You can't shut it
[1:26:00] up. You can't receal it.
[1:26:04] No sir. Because the Bible is the only
[1:26:07] thing we have need of. Brother said
[1:26:10] that's right. He said the Holy Spirit
[1:26:11] wrote the Bible and the Holy Spirit is
[1:26:13] the one who can interpret the Bible and
[1:26:15] he will give it to us as we have need.
[1:26:18] Now I want to say this. The entire Bible
[1:26:20] is built upon revelation. Now that's the
[1:26:25] difference that separates Amen. you from
[1:26:27] a denomination. They have the same Bible
[1:26:31] but revelation
[1:26:34] is what separates this generation. He
[1:26:37] said, "See, you'll never get it by
[1:26:39] reading it like some cold-hearted
[1:26:40] reading." You'll never read the Bible
[1:26:42] like that. He said, "You got to read the
[1:26:44] Bible in the spirit."
[1:26:47] You got to read the Bible in the spirit.
[1:26:49] He said, "You got to be in the mood of
[1:26:51] reading. You got to be in the mood of
[1:26:53] reading." He said, "And when you read
[1:26:55] it, you got to love to read it." He
[1:26:58] said, "Well, I'm not very smart. You
[1:27:00] don't have to be somebody in this world,
[1:27:02] Amen, to know God. You just got to have
[1:27:04] a willing heart. And God will go to
[1:27:06] dealing with that willing heart if
[1:27:08] you're willing for him to deal with it.
[1:27:10] Now watch a prophet bring this on down.
[1:27:12] He says the Bible was written before the
[1:27:15] foundation of the world. He said John
[1:27:17] saw it in the hands of him who sat on
[1:27:19] the throne. Now watch what he says. He
[1:27:21] said now listen the best part of the
[1:27:23] Bible is wrote between the lines. He
[1:27:27] said, "Now listen, the message is not
[1:27:29] all together right on the letter, but
[1:27:32] it's between the lines." He said, "Now
[1:27:35] what's between the lines, Amen, is
[1:27:37] coming from what's on the lines." Are
[1:27:40] you hearing me? In other words, when
[1:27:41] Brother Brandham got those love letters
[1:27:43] from Sister Me, and he was over there in
[1:27:45] the foreign fields and he be to read
[1:27:47] through those love letters. Amen. It's a
[1:27:49] dangerous spot for the devil. He be to
[1:27:51] read through those love letters. He
[1:27:53] said, "I could read what she was saying
[1:27:55] on the lines." He said, "But the message
[1:27:57] was between the lines
[1:28:00] because he was in the same mood that she
[1:28:03] was in. He was in the same feeling that
[1:28:05] she was in." So he knew when she said,
[1:28:07] "I've just put Joseph to bed." That she
[1:28:10] was saying, "I'm tired." Amen. Because
[1:28:12] he knew what she was saying. It was
[1:28:14] coming from between the lines. He said,
[1:28:16] "Listen, and there's no man can open
[1:28:19] this love letter to you except Christ
[1:28:21] himself." Listen, there's no other
[1:28:24] husband can open this love letter to
[1:28:26] you, the bride, except the one who wrote
[1:28:29] it and sent it to you.
[1:28:32] He said, "Now the Bible schools and
[1:28:33] seminaries will never be able to pull it
[1:28:36] out." He said, "God knows it alone and
[1:28:39] will reveal it to who? He will reveal
[1:28:42] it." He said, "And think of it. Let's
[1:28:44] just think of it." Amen. Can you give me
[1:28:46] the picture of Sam uh Houston Coliseum
[1:28:48] and think of it? The same pillar of fire
[1:28:51] that come upon those men that wrote the
[1:28:54] Bible
[1:28:56] is the same pillar of fire that's here
[1:28:59] today interpreting the Bible. Come on.
[1:29:03] That same pillar of fire that you see in
[1:29:05] that picture is the one Moses saw when
[1:29:08] he wrote the first five books of the
[1:29:09] Bible is the one that Paul wrote when he
[1:29:12] wrote the epistles. Amen. That same
[1:29:14] pillar of fire is the one that met
[1:29:17] William Brandom and begin to reveal to
[1:29:19] him the message that was between the
[1:29:22] lines. Oh, but let's not leave it back
[1:29:24] there. Let's bring it right here into
[1:29:27] this building tonight. That same pillar
[1:29:29] of fire is right here in this building
[1:29:32] tonight. And he's not come to condemn
[1:29:34] you. He's not come to bind you. He's not
[1:29:37] come to he not come to kill you. He's
[1:29:40] come to reveal himself to you, to put
[1:29:43] something in you.
[1:29:47] Yes, sir. We got a three-pole message.
[1:29:49] The first pull was healing. The second
[1:29:52] pull was prophesying. But there was a
[1:29:54] third pull. There was a third pull.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Can I preach? There's never been a
[1:30:00] church split over the first six seals.
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:05] There's never been a preacher sat down,
[1:30:08] brother Wayne, over the first two pulls.
[1:30:10] But when it comes to that seventh seal
[1:30:12] and it comes to that third pull is the
[1:30:15] one the devil wants to sit preachers
[1:30:17] down and shut churches down from saying,
[1:30:20] you know why he wants to do that?
[1:30:21] Because the prophet said the seventh
[1:30:24] seal is a loosening. And he said the
[1:30:26] third pull is a releasing. Well, glory
[1:30:29] to God. When the seventh seal was
[1:30:32] opened, it loosened you. And the third
[1:30:35] pull pulled you into the presence of the
[1:30:38] one who loosed you.
[1:30:41] The third pull is the message. He said
[1:30:44] it's the opening of them seven seals to
[1:30:47] reveal the hidden truth that has been
[1:30:50] sealed in the word. Now, you that study
[1:30:52] your Bible know that Daniel is the Old
[1:30:55] Testament book of Revelation, right? The
[1:30:57] prophet of God said, "Oh, Daniel, shut
[1:30:59] up the words and seal the book even to
[1:31:02] the time of the end." Reverend picks
[1:31:03] this up and says, "What is it?" The
[1:31:05] mystery of God. It's God in you, the
[1:31:08] hope of glory shining forth the baptism
[1:31:12] of the Holy Spirit. Daniel 12:8, "All I
[1:31:16] heard, but I understood not." Then said
[1:31:18] I, "Oh my Lord, what shall be the end of
[1:31:21] these things?"
[1:31:22] And he said, "Go thy way, Daniel, for
[1:31:25] the words are closed up and they're
[1:31:28] sealed until the time of the end." Thank
[1:31:32] God there's been a prophet among us who
[1:31:34] said, "The end time message shall reveal
[1:31:38] it." Whatever Daniel saw but could not
[1:31:41] write, was prophesied to be revealed
[1:31:44] under the end time message. He said,
[1:31:46] "The mystery, the things that the church
[1:31:48] world just bats their eyes at and says
[1:31:51] it's nonsense. The mystery of who Jesus
[1:31:53] Christ was, not a third person, not the
[1:31:56] second person, but the person." He said,
[1:31:58] "The mysteries of God will be revealed."
[1:32:02] Are you hearing me now? Because it's
[1:32:04] wrote here in this book and will be
[1:32:06] revealed to the end time generation. The
[1:32:10] mysteries contained in this book will be
[1:32:14] revealed to the end time generation.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I got a little game I play with Malachi
[1:32:21] now. Amen. I'll stand there and be
[1:32:22] looking at him and then I'll look above
[1:32:24] him and say, "Where is Malachi? Where is
[1:32:26] Malachi?" And he'll kind of look around.
[1:32:28] I say, "Where'd Malachi go? Where is
[1:32:30] Malachi?" And all of a sudden he'll
[1:32:32] scream out, "Here I am." Oh, church.
[1:32:36] You've been sitting in churches, some of
[1:32:37] you, since you was born. And you've been
[1:32:39] hearing quotes about end time and
[1:32:41] prophetic people and new generation and
[1:32:44] messiahs and invincible armies and
[1:32:46] overcomers. And the preachers have been
[1:32:49] saying they're coming. Where are they?
[1:32:51] They're coming. But I say thank God for
[1:32:53] these men who quit saying where are
[1:32:55] they? They're coming. They said here
[1:32:57] they are. And you looked up and said
[1:32:59] here I is. I'm the one that's going to
[1:33:02] put my foot on the head of that devil.
[1:33:05] I'm the one that's going to crush sin.
[1:33:07] I'm the one that's going to tame that
[1:33:08] beast. I'm the one that's going to lock
[1:33:10] that devil up because I know I'm a part
[1:33:14] of the end time generation.
[1:33:18] I'm not a chicken. I'm an eagle. I'm not
[1:33:20] a I'm a warrior. I'm not
[1:33:23] defeated. I'm victorious.
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal book is now being
[1:33:31] released. He said, "What is it that open
[1:33:34] them seals then?" What is the opening of
[1:33:37] seals then?
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just say what brother said.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Revealing Christ.
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And then he come along, brother Mad, and
[1:33:49] said, "What is it?"
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; It's Christ coming to his body. Christ
[1:33:54] in the word. We all know the anointing
[1:33:57] is Christ
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; that comes on your feelings.
[1:34:04] that comes on your emotions,
[1:34:07] that comes on a preacher's personality,
[1:34:10] that comes on the word that makes the
[1:34:14] word live. Is that right? He says, "Now
[1:34:18] the word is in your heart."
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. The word is in your heart. Do
[1:34:25] you believe in divine healing seed and
[1:34:28] Christ the anointing coming to his body?
[1:34:31] Do you see the connection there? It's
[1:34:33] just like a husband and wife to become
[1:34:36] one. He said, "Now the church has got to
[1:34:39] get to the ministry until the church and
[1:34:42] Christ become one." Oh, God. And he can
[1:34:45] anoint you
[1:34:48] for every blessing that's in the Bible.
[1:34:51] All of it is yours.
[1:34:55] All of it is yours. Everything is
[1:34:59] promised at this age is yours. Oh, may I
[1:35:03] say it tonight? The message is not
[1:35:06] coming. The message is here. Come on,
[1:35:09] Moses. God ain't putting a seed in your
[1:35:11] soul. You were born with a seed in your
[1:35:13] soul. The only thing that's happening is
[1:35:16] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:18] is going to strike that fake seed on the
[1:35:21] inside of your heart and it's going to
[1:35:23] move you from crying to speaking.
[1:35:27] Why cry speak?
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:34] I want it. I want it. I want it. It's
[1:35:36] here.
[1:35:37] I want it. I want it. It's yours.
[1:35:42] It's already yours.
[1:35:45] You were born with it.
[1:35:48] Listen. Get mad at him if you want to.
[1:35:50] You was born with the rapture in you.
[1:35:53] You was born with the seed of God on the
[1:35:56] inside of your soul.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; It's already yours. You will not get
[1:36:04] good enough to get it. You will not pray
[1:36:06] hard enough to get it. You will not fast
[1:36:08] long enough to get it. You will not beat
[1:36:10] this altar and pull it out of this
[1:36:12] altar. It was already in you as a
[1:36:15] predestinated seed.
[1:36:21] I don't know about you, I didn't come
[1:36:23] here to see Brother Wayne or Brother
[1:36:25] Josh or Brother Nathan or any other
[1:36:27] preacher. I come here to have an
[1:36:28] audience with God. Brother Brian, I came
[1:36:31] here to have an audience with the one
[1:36:33] who saved me. I come here to have an
[1:36:34] audience with the one that delivered me.
[1:36:36] And I want to tell you what a prophet
[1:36:38] said. He said, "We ever one have a right
[1:36:41] to have an audience with Jesus just
[1:36:43] now."
[1:36:45] What does it mean to have an audience
[1:36:47] with someone? It means to have a formal
[1:36:50] meeting.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Now, no, the devil ain't hijacking that
[1:36:55] one.
[1:36:57] No, the devil ain't hijacking that one.
[1:36:59] We ain't formal.
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:04] Only fundamentals about this bride is
[1:37:06] she knows who she is.
[1:37:09] Woo! Glory. She knows who she is.
[1:37:13] Oh, that's why the devil hates this
[1:37:14] camp. We're not a bunch of fundamentals
[1:37:16] trying to make sure everybody knows
[1:37:17] there's a Bible and there's a Jesus and
[1:37:19] there's a cross. Some of you all been
[1:37:20] hearing this.
[1:37:23] Don't me take my liberty. You can only
[1:37:25] get saved once, saints.
[1:37:28] Come on. Every camp ain't a new start.
[1:37:30] Every camp ain't getting saved again.
[1:37:32] And and I tell you why we've got the
[1:37:35] condition we've got is cuz hirelings
[1:37:38] behind the pull pit have treated you all
[1:37:40] like ignoramuses that you didn't know
[1:37:42] nothing and you couldn't hear nothing.
[1:37:44] And so every service was a little Bible
[1:37:46] story or let's just come down to the
[1:37:48] altar and cry. But I say thank God for
[1:37:50] men like Nathan Ericson that'll take the
[1:37:52] gloves off and say we believe the
[1:37:55] message. If you want a Baptist camp, go
[1:37:57] to Young Life. But if you want a pillar
[1:37:59] of fire Damascus Road experience, then
[1:38:02] come hear the message of the hour.
[1:38:03] Listen, this ain't about brother Nathan.
[1:38:05] It ain't about True Word. It ain't about
[1:38:07] Brother Wayne or Brother Ray or any
[1:38:09] other preacher. It's about building a
[1:38:11] place where you can come in contact with
[1:38:14] the God who sent this message, with the
[1:38:17] God who opened these seals, with the God
[1:38:20] who sent Elijah, with the God who called
[1:38:22] your name.
[1:38:25] Hallelujah. I say, "Thank God. I got a
[1:38:28] meeting tonight. I got a meeting
[1:38:30] tonight. I got a conference with the
[1:38:33] Lord. He can change everything about my
[1:38:35] life.
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:40] This ain't about you coming and seeing
[1:38:41] who's here and who's not. It's about you
[1:38:43] meeting the high priest.
[1:38:47] It's about you having an audience.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm feeling too good, brother
[1:38:52] Wayne. It's about you having an audience
[1:38:56] with the high priest.
[1:38:59] We cannot counsel you out of some
[1:39:01] situations.
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; We cannot read you out of situations.
[1:39:09] We cannot psychologize you.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; I just made up a new word, Zach.
[1:39:15] Psychologize.
[1:39:17] We can't do it. It's going to take
[1:39:19] something more. It's going to take
[1:39:21] something of power.
[1:39:24] But can I say what a prophet said? He
[1:39:26] said, "Oh, I'm not presuming. The high
[1:39:28] priest is descending from his throne
[1:39:31] into the church." Glory to God. The high
[1:39:35] priest is not on his way. The high
[1:39:37] priest is not stuck in traffic. The high
[1:39:40] priest is not broke down on the side of
[1:39:42] the road from glory. He's right here in
[1:39:45] this building tonight.
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:50] It's your time. The high priest is here.
[1:39:54] Are you hearing me?
[1:39:56] Now's the time to turn loose.
[1:40:01] Now's the time to turn loose. Oh, I'm
[1:40:03] waiting. I'm holding. I'm waiting. I'm
[1:40:05] waiting. I'm holding back. You're going
[1:40:07] to miss it. You're going to miss it.
[1:40:10] We're over halfway through this camp.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Turn loose.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Turn loose.
[1:40:23] Turn loose. Go ahead, young people. Turn
[1:40:27] loose. Let it all go tonight. Release
[1:40:29] your faith. Release your authority.
[1:40:32] release the word of God.
[1:40:35] We didn't come here to hold on to
[1:40:36] something. We come here to turn it loose
[1:40:39] because my Bible says we have a great
[1:40:41] high priest who has passed into the
[1:40:44] heavens. He is Jesus the son of God. And
[1:40:47] a prophet said, "Let us hold fast our
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; profession." Look what the prophet said.
[1:40:55] Now he is the high priest of your
[1:40:58] confession.
[1:41:00] Oh man, I tell you Lord, if I could just
[1:41:02] confess it like brother Josh did last
[1:41:04] night. Lord, if I could just confess it,
[1:41:06] Lord, if you would just give me the
[1:41:07] boldness of Nathan Ericson, I could
[1:41:09] really do something for you. Thank God
[1:41:11] for Brother Nathan. But Nathan's place
[1:41:14] is already taken. He's here trying to
[1:41:17] inspire you to get the same boldness he
[1:41:20] had as a young man to declare this
[1:41:22] message is more than a suggestion. It's
[1:41:25] an absolute.
[1:41:28] Are you hearing me? Are you hearing me?
[1:41:30] He's not just the high priest of these
[1:41:32] brothers confession. He's the high
[1:41:34] priest of your
[1:41:38] Come on. The cat's had your tongue long
[1:41:39] enough. It's time to say something.
[1:41:49] A profession means to profess and to
[1:41:53] confess the same thing. See, confess
[1:41:56] means to say
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; the same thing.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Now, we first got to feel it.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; No, we first got to confess it.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said he can't do
[1:42:13] nothing for us until we are ready to say
[1:42:19] that he's already done it. First time
[1:42:22] I've ever preached watching myself
[1:42:23] preach.
[1:42:25] Are you hearing me? He's already done
[1:42:28] it. You ain't about to stream tonight.
[1:42:31] He's already done it. He's not going to
[1:42:35] do it. He's not waiting for you to get
[1:42:37] good enough for him to do it. He's
[1:42:39] already done it. You're already healed.
[1:42:42] You're already saved. You're already
[1:42:45] victorious. You're already sealed.
[1:42:48] You're already got your name in the
[1:42:50] Lamb's Book of Life.
[1:42:52] Hallelujah to God. Hallelujah. He's
[1:42:56] already done it.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to confess, he's
[1:43:05] already done it.
[1:43:09] Brother Brandon said, "Then God work on
[1:43:12] your confession."
[1:43:16] Now, it's the Bible. 1 Corinthians 4:20,
[1:43:20] the kingdom of God is God's word made
[1:43:24] power,
[1:43:25] [Applause]
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; not intellectual.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; God's word.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; made power.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; When the word comes in there, the
[1:43:37] kingdom's in you. Then what does this
[1:43:39] word begin? It turns
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; itself into power.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] Folks, I wish I had two hours on this
[1:43:51] quote.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Making it say just exactly
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; what it said.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see? You can't say this and the
[1:44:02] word say this and make it work.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; See, the word says you're already
[1:44:08] healed.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; You can't say, "I still feel bad."
[1:44:15] The word says the devil's already
[1:44:17] defeated. You can't say the devil's
[1:44:20] still controlling me.
[1:44:23] The word says you were saved before the
[1:44:27] foundation of the world. You can't say
[1:44:30] if I can just get somewhere and get good
[1:44:32] get enough, God will say, "Glory to God.
[1:44:35] He'll already do it." Are you hearing
[1:44:37] me? This is more than a sermon. This is
[1:44:41] more than a quote. This is more than a
[1:44:43] phrase. Oh God, hallelujah. This is the
[1:44:46] unsealed saints of the book of
[1:44:49] Revelation. House of hell, release the
[1:44:52] tongues of the children of God to
[1:44:54] confess the word of God.
[1:44:58] You got to say the same thing the word
[1:45:00] says.
[1:45:02] You can't say, "I'm a failure." And the
[1:45:04] word say you can do all things through
[1:45:05] Christ who strengthens you. You can't
[1:45:08] say, "I'm not going to make it." And the
[1:45:09] words say, "You've already made it."
[1:45:14] You've got to say,
[1:45:19] "God bless you, Sister Karen. You've got
[1:45:21] to say the same thing the word already
[1:45:24] said.
[1:45:27] That's why you're a word bride."
[1:45:31] Now, we have a high priest
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; and we can come boldly.
[1:45:38] Now, I know what you're thinking.
[1:45:39] Boldly, bless God. Amen. Boldly. That's
[1:45:41] got to be kicking chairs out of the way,
[1:45:45] knocking people over, kicking the
[1:45:49] That's boldly, brother. That's boldly.
[1:45:51] Glory to God. You know what the Bible
[1:45:53] says boldly means? It means
[1:45:56] unreservedness in what you say.
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:03] In other words, when you speak, you
[1:46:05] can't have no fear in your speech.
[1:46:10] In other words, when you confess the
[1:46:12] word of God.
[1:46:15] You can't say, "Well, this is what
[1:46:17] brother said." But
[1:46:19] let me tell you what I think. That's a
[1:46:22] coward. But a bold person is one who can
[1:46:25] just read it and say it and stand behind
[1:46:28] it.
[1:46:29] And I stand behind every quote from 47
[1:46:33] to 65, from Genesis to Revelation,
[1:46:36] because we know what we're talking
[1:46:38] about. We're not a bunch of idiots.
[1:46:41] We're not a bunch of educated idiots.
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:50] I'm going to tell you something. I know
[1:46:51] there's a lot of stuff pops up on
[1:46:53] YouTube, but you got tapes. Get back in
[1:46:55] them.
[1:46:57] I don't care what polished up hireling.
[1:47:03] I'm sorry. I'm done playing with these
[1:47:05] devils,
[1:47:06] Wesley. I'm done playing with them. I
[1:47:09] don't care how fancy, how great a
[1:47:11] PowerPoint they can put together. I'm
[1:47:13] not looking for a PowerPoint.
[1:47:15] Brother Zach, we're looking for a
[1:47:16] powerful point. We're looking for
[1:47:18] something to release the faith of God in
[1:47:21] the hearts of the children of God to
[1:47:23] accept the word of God.
[1:47:26] Stay with what's on the tapes. There is
[1:47:29] no confusion. There is no
[1:47:31] misunderstandings.
[1:47:32] It's the sealed book. Saints
[1:47:36] unsealed.
[1:47:44] And I rebuke every devil. I rebuke every
[1:47:48] spirit from the pits of hell that tries
[1:47:50] to get on your ears and tell you that
[1:47:52] your pastor ain't some smart preacher
[1:47:54] cuz he ain't saying it the way some
[1:47:56] intellectual
[1:47:58] says it. If he's saying what a prophet
[1:48:00] said, he's an Einstein in my book.
[1:48:05] If he's saying what the tape say, he's
[1:48:08] an Einstein in my book.
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:20] Not looking to talk to anybody. I want
[1:48:23] to meet the high priest. Noah, brother
[1:48:25] Noah, I want to talk to the high priest.
[1:48:28] So, I've got to know what to say.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to get an audience with
[1:48:35] him,
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; brother Ezekiel, I've got to know what
[1:48:37] to say.
[1:48:39] If you're going to get a if you're going
[1:48:41] to get an audience with a doctor, you
[1:48:43] can't go in there and sit down and start
[1:48:45] teaching your homeopathic remedies.
[1:48:48] [Applause]
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; It's not the same language.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It just come out.
[1:49:00] If you want a job as a plumber with a
[1:49:03] plumbing company, you can't go talk to
[1:49:06] the CEO about dirt work.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; You got to talk the same language.
[1:49:12] [Applause]
[1:49:13] You got to know what to say, what they
[1:49:16] want to hear to create the desire that
[1:49:19] you're desiring. Oh God, can I say what
[1:49:22] a prophet said? He said, "I am the Lord
[1:49:24] thy God which brought thee out of the
[1:49:26] land of Egypt."
[1:49:29] Brother Andrew, I don't know what to
[1:49:30] say. I don't know what to say. You
[1:49:33] ready?
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Open thy mouth wide.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; And I, the Lord, will feel it.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; If you'll open your mouth, he won't put
[1:49:55] some little Baptist idea in there. If
[1:49:58] you'll open your mouth, he will deposit
[1:50:01] some Pentecostal tradition in there. If
[1:50:03] you'll open your mouth, he will fill it
[1:50:06] with the unsealed sayings of the book of
[1:50:08] Revelation. He will give you something
[1:50:11] to say. I don't have to look for
[1:50:12] something to say. God sent a prophet and
[1:50:15] he gave me something to say.
[1:50:24] Lord, brother said, not knowing what to
[1:50:26] say, but believing you will supply those
[1:50:28] things. I commit myself to you with this
[1:50:31] church that you circumcise my lips to
[1:50:34] speak the right thing and their hearts
[1:50:37] to receive it.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, Moses.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, Moses.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; You were born with a commission.
[1:50:50] God brought you on the earth for a
[1:50:52] purpose.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "God, behold, when I come to
[1:50:57] the children of Israel,
[1:51:00] and shall say unto them,
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; the God of your fathers
[1:51:07] hath,
[1:51:10] how do I sound that out?
[1:51:12] S
[1:51:16] sent
[1:51:17] me unto you
[1:51:20] and they shall say,
[1:51:23] what is his name?
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; What shall I
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I say unto them?
[1:51:39] And God said to Moses, I am that I am.
[1:51:43] [Music]
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; I am that I am. Oh, glory to God.
[1:51:53] And Moses said, "Thus shalt thou say
[1:51:57] unto the children of Israel,
[1:52:02] no. No, that's not how he said it after
[1:52:04] God spoke to him.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; No, that's not how he said it. He said,
[1:52:08] "And thou shalt say unto the children of
[1:52:11] Israel, I am has sent me unto you." Look
[1:52:13] at Exodus 4:10. And Moses said unto the
[1:52:16] Lord, "Oh my Lord, I am not eloquent,
[1:52:19] neither here to for nor since thou has
[1:52:21] spoken of thy servant. But Lord, I am
[1:52:23] slow of speech.
[1:52:28] And Lord, I'm a young person.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I've made many mistakes and
[1:52:34] I'm only 15 years old.
[1:52:39] Lord, there's people better qualified
[1:52:43] than
[1:52:46] Lord. I'm of slow speech and of a slow
[1:52:49] tongue. But the Lord said unto him, "Who
[1:52:52] hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the
[1:52:55] dumb or the deaf or the sin or the
[1:52:58] blind? Have not I the Lord? Moses, have
[1:53:02] you forgot who I am? I'm the creator of
[1:53:06] the body that you're standing in
[1:53:15] now. Therefore, go
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; come here, Moses. I want to have a pity
[1:53:20] party with you. Come here. I won't tell
[1:53:22] you how bad it is. I want to tell you
[1:53:24] that. Yeah, it's really
[1:53:26] go therefore and I will be with thy
[1:53:29] mouth
[1:53:31] and I will teach thee what thou shalt
[1:53:33] say. Brother Wayne and I filmed this the
[1:53:36] other day. I'm about to shout it all
[1:53:37] over the place. Brother Brmond said,
[1:53:38] "Moses of a slow tongue, not eloquent,
[1:53:41] of a slow speech." But when he went down
[1:53:44] there and brother Ben, he began to say
[1:53:46] what the Lord put in his mouth. He said
[1:53:49] he was healed by saying what God put in
[1:53:52] his mouth.
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:57] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Can I tell you
[1:54:00] this? The book is already open. The
[1:54:03] seals are already broke. I'm not looking
[1:54:06] for something to say. The word of
[1:54:08] healing, the word of faith is nigh. It
[1:54:11] is already in your heart and it is in
[1:54:14] your mouth and it's the word we speak.
[1:54:23] It's the word we speak
[1:54:26] [Applause]
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; now. Lord, that was Moses.
[1:54:32] And Lord,
[1:54:36] that was a mighty prophet of God. But
[1:54:38] I'm just a little young person.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Matthew 10:18. And ye shall be brought
[1:54:45] before governors and kings for my sake.
[1:54:49] for a testimony against them.
[1:54:53] I was studying today in my room and the
[1:54:54] spirit of the Lord dropped this in my
[1:54:55] heart. I'll bring you before the king of
[1:54:57] anxiety.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. It's something we've settled
[1:55:04] down as normal because it's the spirit
[1:55:06] of the age. It's a devil.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; It's a tormentor. I don't care what
[1:55:11] scientific name we give it. I don't care
[1:55:13] what doctor's diagnos we give it. It's a
[1:55:15] devil from the pits of hell that's
[1:55:18] trying to control your life, trying to
[1:55:20] control your future.
[1:55:22] Can I just call it what it is? It's
[1:55:24] Lucifer. But we're here tonight.
[1:55:28] Brother Josh, can I use it from last
[1:55:30] night? He put a sword in our hand last
[1:55:32] night. I want to follow it up and put a
[1:55:34] word in your mouth tonight. You want to
[1:55:36] talk about armed and dangerous? You want
[1:55:39] to talk about armed and dangerous? Some
[1:55:41] of y'all probably heard brother Ron
[1:55:42] preach that. You want to talk about
[1:55:43] armed and dangerous? How much more armed
[1:55:45] and dangerous can you get than a end
[1:55:47] time generation people knowing who they
[1:55:50] are with a sword in their hand and the
[1:55:53] word of faith in their mouth.
[1:55:57] There is no devil can stand before you.
[1:56:04] There is no devil can stand before you.
[1:56:08] Oh yeah. I know what that devil does.
[1:56:10] And devil runs you around like a ragd
[1:56:11] doll and tells you this this day and
[1:56:13] you're that the next day. He's a liar.
[1:56:15] He's a liar from the pits of hell. God,
[1:56:18] if you'll open your mouth, God will feel
[1:56:20] it tonight.
[1:56:25] I feel like prophesying by the word of
[1:56:26] the Lord. I believe some of y'all is
[1:56:28] going to walk through this prayer line.
[1:56:30] You've opened your mouth and let
[1:56:32] critical words come in it. You've opened
[1:56:34] your mouth and criticized and gossiped
[1:56:36] and pour down everything else. Why don't
[1:56:38] you open your mouth tonight and tear
[1:56:40] down the devil's kingdom?
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:45] Why don't you use that tongue?
[1:56:49] Quit sashing your mama and sass the
[1:56:51] devil.
[1:56:54] Quit back talking your daddy and back
[1:56:56] talk that devil. Put him in his place
[1:56:58] tonight.
[1:57:03] The word is nigh thee.
[1:57:12] When they deliver you up,
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; take no thought.
[1:57:19] Earl and I about shouted that little
[1:57:21] hotel down over there
[1:57:23] cuz the spirit of Lord spoke that in my
[1:57:25] heart when I read that with an audible
[1:57:26] voice. And I'm not trying to be I'm just
[1:57:28] preaching
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; cuz I know that devil's running rampant
[1:57:31] around this camp. that devil of
[1:57:33] nervousness and that devil of confusion,
[1:57:35] that devil of fear running rampant
[1:57:36] around here. I know it. I'm not a
[1:57:38] prophet, neither am I the son of the
[1:57:39] prophet, but I follow a prophet's
[1:57:40] message.
[1:57:42] And I read that and the spirit of the
[1:57:43] Lord said, "Stand before the king of
[1:57:44] anxiety." And then I read the next verse
[1:57:46] and you know what it said? It said, "And
[1:57:48] take no thought." And I looked up the
[1:57:50] word thought, Brother Wayne, and the
[1:57:52] word thought means anxious.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, I'm on a rabbit trail now."
[1:57:59] I said, "We got a word anxiety.
[1:58:02] So, I went to brother Google and I found
[1:58:04] out the word anxiety comes from the word
[1:58:07] anxious. And the Bible said, "Don't be
[1:58:10] anxious."
[1:58:11] You know why you got anxiety? Because
[1:58:13] you're trying to figure out what to say
[1:58:16] to overcome that devil. But tonight, the
[1:58:18] word of the Lord is here. You don't have
[1:58:20] to figure out something to say.
[1:58:24] You don't have to find something in some
[1:58:26] psychology book to say, "The word is in
[1:58:29] my heart." And from the abundance of the
[1:58:32] heart does the mouth speak. Open up your
[1:58:35] mouth and God will fill it with the word
[1:58:38] of faith.
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Take no thought of what you're going to
[1:58:52] say
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; or how or what shall speak.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; For it shall be given you in that same
[1:58:58] hour ye shall speak. Where have I read
[1:59:00] that word? Oh, that's right. All
[1:59:02] scriptures given.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Take no fault.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Now, can we read the next verse?
[1:59:14] For it is not ye that speak,
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:21] [Music]
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; but the spirit of your father
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; which speaketh in you.
[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Cut his head off.
[1:59:39] It's not you that speaketh.
[1:59:42] It's the spirit of your father whereby
[1:59:45] we cry ab by father. So you mean this is
[1:59:50] adoption sons?
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; You mean the end time generation is
[1:59:55] manifested sons? You mean it's not you
[1:59:58] speaking Micah, it's the father speaking
[2:00:02] through you.
[2:00:10] God that's in you,
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; he does the speaking.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; If you premeditate it,
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; then you did your own thinking.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; But if you're just willing to be the
[2:00:22] lamb, the dove will do the speaking.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Do you see what Brother Josh said last
[2:00:28] night? You're another Mary.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; I believe you said that last night.
[2:00:32] You're another Mary.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what's in this building
[2:00:37] tonight? What you're feeling
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; is overshadowing power.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; The power of the highest. Oh God shall
[2:00:46] overshadow thee.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Now Mary says, "Lord, how can I do this?
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; I'm slow of speech.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not a eloquent speaker.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; I'm a little girl that's not married.
[2:01:01] And if I have a child, they're going to
[2:01:03] call my child illegitimate. I'm in a how
[2:01:06] I'm in a horrible condition. How am I
[2:01:08] going to do this? But the power of God
[2:01:10] dropped in the building
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; and begin to overshadow her. Can I say
[2:01:15] this to you? That word overshadow means
[2:01:18] the use of the Holy Spirit exerting
[2:01:21] creative energy
[2:01:22] [Music]
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; upon the womb of the Virgin Mary and
[2:01:26] impregnating it. It's a use of the word
[2:01:29] which seems to have been drawn from the
[2:01:32] familiar Old Testament idea
[2:01:35] of a cloud
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; as symbolizing the immediate presence.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I know they made fun of me for preaching
[2:01:53] last year. I'm going to preach it again.
[2:01:57] a cloud overshadowing
[2:02:01] the presence and the power of God.
[2:02:03] Listen folks, the same power of God that
[2:02:06] met Mary and filled her mouth with the
[2:02:08] word. Come on. She didn't know what to
[2:02:10] say, but the angel, the cloud, gave her
[2:02:12] something to say. And when God wanted a
[2:02:14] response out of Mary, she said these
[2:02:17] words, "Be it unto me according to thy
[2:02:22] word."
[2:02:24] And the word she said, brother Jonathan,
[2:02:28] the word she said created the savior in
[2:02:32] her soul that saved my life.
[2:02:37] Listen, I'm not a crazy man. Some of you
[2:02:38] got loved ones running from God right
[2:02:40] now. Speak the word.
[2:02:43] Speak the word over them mamas. Speak
[2:02:46] the word over them daddies.
[2:02:49] [Applause]
[2:02:51] God can put a word
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; in your mouth.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Do you call this the final kill? Going
[2:03:03] in for the final kill.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Going in there and tear that devil down.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Want to tear him down
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; right now? We're turning to a prayer
[2:03:16] line right now. If you start thinking
[2:03:19] about it, it'll never happen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; When I get up there, I'm going to say
[2:03:25] this, and I'm going to say that, and I'm
[2:03:26] going to say this, and I'm going to say
[2:03:28] that, and I'm going to say this, and I'm
[2:03:29] going to say that, and
[2:03:32] you know what I found? We come in prayer
[2:03:33] lines saying more what the devil said
[2:03:35] than what God said.
[2:03:37] Well, the devil told me I'm this, and
[2:03:39] the devil told me that.
[2:03:42] Listen, the devil's a liar.
[2:03:45] He's a liar.
[2:03:47] How long are you going to lend your
[2:03:49] mouth to him?
[2:03:52] Brother Matt, if I'm going to say
[2:03:54] something, I'm going to say something
[2:03:55] that's the truth.
[2:03:58] And what the devil says is not. But
[2:04:00] brother Josh, what the word says, he
[2:04:02] said I would know the truth and the
[2:04:04] truth would make me free.
[2:04:07] Glory to God. The devil is right here
[2:04:10] now.
[2:04:12] I I'm just saying I'm not going to call
[2:04:13] her out. She's right here in this
[2:04:14] building tonight. Amen. Come. I prayed
[2:04:16] for a young girl the other day come in
[2:04:18] the prayer line and she said these
[2:04:19] words. The devil's told me this and I'm
[2:04:21] not pretty and I'm not this and I'm not
[2:04:22] that and the devil's told me this. Amen.
[2:04:25] But what did the word say about you?
[2:04:26] What did the word say about you? You
[2:04:28] know what the word said about her? The
[2:04:30] word said she was a daughter of God. She
[2:04:32] was fearfully and wonderfully made. And
[2:04:34] when I stood there and begin to quote
[2:04:37] the word of God over her life, she fell
[2:04:39] under the power of God. It wasn't me.
[2:04:42] It's the word that we speak.
[2:04:47] Open up your mouth and God will feel it.
[2:04:55] You said, "Brother Ander, I don't know.
[2:04:56] You're getting way out there. The Holy
[2:04:58] Spirit's here. He's moved over you. And
[2:05:00] I believe the same one that could
[2:05:02] overshadow Mary that could create,
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; he can also
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:05:12] put a word
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; in your mouth
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; and that will bring that devil down.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Wayne here, I want to
[2:05:25] borrow a testimony from him. You've
[2:05:27] heard him tell it. He went to India
[2:05:29] several years ago, many years ago, and
[2:05:31] he was there preaching, and while he was
[2:05:33] preaching, he went in this building, and
[2:05:35] you all heard the testimony. There was
[2:05:37] there was gods, pictures of Hindu gods
[2:05:39] all over the wall. and he said, "We
[2:05:41] wanted to take them down to preach the
[2:05:43] gospel, but they wouldn't let us." So,
[2:05:45] Brother Wayne, being the message
[2:05:47] preacher he is, went in there and just
[2:05:48] kept preaching the message in the face
[2:05:50] of all them hideous, ugly gods.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; And while he was preaching, there was a
[2:05:56] lady fell over and I don't know if she
[2:05:58] fell dead or she just fell over the
[2:05:59] demon possession
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; right there. They went over and prayed
[2:06:03] for her and Brother Wayne comes back to
[2:06:06] start preaching and he says it like
[2:06:07] this. before I knew what I was saying. I
[2:06:11] said, "If that woman don't get up off
[2:06:13] the ground, God's not even God." Is that
[2:06:15] right?
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I put my hand kind of like
[2:06:18] the devil's trying to get some of y'all
[2:06:20] to do right now.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; I put my hand over my mouth." He said,
[2:06:23] "Cuz I knew that if I said that, that
[2:06:27] was the craziest thing to say. Cuz
[2:06:28] whether that woman got up off the ground
[2:06:30] or not, God is still God."
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; But what happened was the final
[2:06:35] showdown.
[2:06:37] What happened was God brought a showdown
[2:06:40] right there under a son of God with the
[2:06:44] word of God in his mouth.
[2:06:48] And that woman got up off the ground.
[2:06:50] And when she got up off the ground, he
[2:06:52] said, "The power of God knocked the
[2:06:54] pictures off the wall."
[2:06:58] Is that the truth, Brother Wayne? You
[2:07:00] say, "Preacher, that was Brother Wayne."
[2:07:02] Well, let me say this. If God can take a
[2:07:04] piece of Arkansas dirt and fill him with
[2:07:06] the word of faith and put a word in his
[2:07:09] mouth and open the seals to him and send
[2:07:11] him to India to stand there and bring
[2:07:13] the word of God to a showdown, he can
[2:07:15] take a piece of Tennessee dirt. He can
[2:07:18] take a piece of North Carolina dirt. He
[2:07:20] can take any piece of dirt in this
[2:07:21] building tonight and put you before your
[2:07:23] enemy. And that enemy will have to fall
[2:07:26] at your feet.
[2:07:30] [Applause]
[2:07:32] Listen, it's time to draw your sword.
[2:07:34] It's time to draw your sword. I said
[2:07:37] it's time to draw your sword. We've been
[2:07:39] preaching. We've been praying. We've
[2:07:41] been worshiping. We've been singing.
[2:07:43] We've been dedicating ourselves for this
[2:07:45] moment, for this time right here. Satan,
[2:07:49] you're fixing to die. Satan, you're
[2:07:52] fixing to lose your hold. You've held as
[2:07:55] long as you're going to hold. You bound
[2:07:57] as long as you're going to bind.
[2:08:00] The word of faith is in the building
[2:08:03] tonight and there's a mouth open.
[2:08:07] [Applause]
[2:08:10] Lord, if you'll feel it, I'll say it.
[2:08:16] Lord, if you'll feel it, I'll say it.
[2:08:23] Birds of a feather flock together.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Your tongues, you're ruined.
[2:08:28] Give enough cow, enough rope, it'll hang
[2:08:30] itself. Those were good old saying, but
[2:08:32] we got some new sayings.
[2:08:35] My name was in the lamb's book of life
[2:08:37] from before the foundation of the world.
[2:08:40] [Applause]
[2:08:42] Before there was one sin, I was already
[2:08:45] in the mind of God. I am the sinless,
[2:08:48] spotless, virtuous bride of Jesus
[2:08:51] Christ. I'm not just forgiven. I'm
[2:08:53] justified. It's as though I never done
[2:08:56] it. Satan is defeated. I can live so
[2:08:59] close to God that the devil don't know
[2:09:01] what to do with me.
[2:09:04] I'm not just a young person. I'm an
[2:09:06] overcomer.
[2:09:08] Open your mouth tonight. The book is
[2:09:11] open. The revelation is here. It just
[2:09:14] needs a voice to speak it.
[2:09:17] I give my voice.
[2:09:23] He said, "Brother Andrew,
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; that's too much." No, it's not.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; No, it's not. It's your time to speak.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; The living Christ is right here in this
[2:09:33] building tonight. The word is in your
[2:09:35] mouth.
[2:09:37] The word is in your mouth.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Go and take the little book.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; It's open in the hand.
[2:09:49] And eat the book. For thou must
[2:09:53] whisper
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; again.
[2:09:58] Thou must make another devil deal with
[2:10:01] the devil.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Thou must prophesy
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; before many peoples,
[2:10:09] many kings, many tongues, and many
[2:10:13] nations.
[2:10:15] I'm not going to read it to you. I'm
[2:10:16] just going to tell it to you in one
[2:10:17] point. The word is in your mouth.
[2:10:21] And the word is a sword and it is
[2:10:24] sharper than any two-edged sword. It
[2:10:27] will pierce the
[2:10:29] will divide and it will pierce the
[2:10:31] enemy's heart.
[2:10:35] Can I tell you why the devil's against
[2:10:37] you right now?
[2:10:39] Brother said this. He said the swer the
[2:10:42] sword is in your mouth and the enemy
[2:10:44] will be slayed by the word that proceeds
[2:10:46] from his mouth. Whatever they say is
[2:10:49] going to happen because it's the word of
[2:10:51] God coming from the mouth of God.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; The same mouth of Moses that was slow of
[2:10:59] speech.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; And couldn't pronounce words right
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; said what God put in his mouth.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; And then turned and created flies.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Turned water into blood.
[2:11:16] That's right.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; See, the word
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; is nigh thee. When a spirit born,
[2:11:21] spiritfilled man in faith takes the word
[2:11:23] into his heart,
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; places it upon his lips.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Why? That's the same as deity speaking.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Can I read the rest of it?
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Every mountain has to go.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, Satan cannot stand before
[2:11:40] that man.
[2:11:42] Did you hear that, devil? You can't
[2:11:45] stand before this open book generation.
[2:11:48] You can't stand before these young
[2:11:49] people. You can't stand before the bride
[2:11:52] of Christ.
[2:11:55] The word has never failed in the mouths
[2:11:57] of believing Christians. And in this
[2:12:00] last age, it is here stronger.
[2:12:03] It is here stronger.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Don't get mad at me. It's here stronger
[2:12:08] in your mouth tonight than it was in
[2:12:09] Hatty Rights.
[2:12:11] [Applause]
[2:12:14] Is that okay? It's here stronger in your
[2:12:16] mouth tonight than it was in Bankswoods.
[2:12:23] [Applause]
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; You know what's pushing against that
[2:12:27] right now is that devil that's fixing to
[2:12:28] fall at your feet.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; You know why that devil didn't want you
[2:12:33] to say amen right there? It's cuz he
[2:12:37] knows, brother Josh, he's fixing to fall
[2:12:39] at your feet. But go ahead, end time
[2:12:42] generation, and say, "Amen. That ain't
[2:12:45] nothing but the truth." Hallelujah. The
[2:12:47] word is in me. It's stronger in me. It's
[2:12:51] greater in me than any generation before
[2:12:53] me.
[2:12:56] Release the word.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; I'm done right here.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; God redeemed you and the devil ain't
[2:13:08] going to use you.
[2:13:13] God redeems you and the devil don't have
[2:13:16] no right to use your voice. He don't
[2:13:18] have no right to use your tongue. He
[2:13:20] don't have no right to use your hands.
[2:13:23] He don't have no right to use your feet.
[2:13:25] He don't have no right to use your mind.
[2:13:30] God redeemed you because it's his time
[2:13:32] to speak through you.
[2:13:36] He's already spoke through Moses. He's
[2:13:39] already spoke through brother Brandham.
[2:13:41] He's
[2:13:42] brother Wayne. He's already spoke
[2:13:44] through you and continues to. But right
[2:13:46] here tonight, young people, you say,
[2:13:48] "I've been wanting to speak and that
[2:13:49] devil fall." It's going to happen right
[2:13:51] here tonight.
[2:13:54] It's your turn to speak.
[2:13:59] Why cry? Speak.
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:05] The only time to cry is when the book is
[2:14:08] closed.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; But when the book comes open,
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; you ready to approach him?
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; You ready to approach the high priest?
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; How many have heard brother Paul say
[2:14:23] like this? God thought it.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram spoke it.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; That settles it. Anybody
[2:14:34] ever heard that?
[2:14:38] Would it be okay tonight if we take that
[2:14:41] a step further?
[2:14:44] God fought it. Brother Brandham spoke
[2:14:46] it. I believe it. That settles it. Now
[2:14:50] I'm going to say it.
[2:14:55] I believed and therefore have I spoken.
[2:14:58] The reason I'm speaking is because I
[2:15:01] believe
[2:15:03] I believe what I'm saying. I believe
[2:15:06] he's a healer. I believe he's a
[2:15:09] deliverer. I believe he's a Holy Ghost
[2:15:11] healer. I believe he's a soul saver. I
[2:15:14] believe he's a cancer killer. I believe
[2:15:16] he's a prodical child. Bring it home.
[2:15:18] God, I believe. And because I believe is
[2:15:22] the reason I speak. And there ain't no
[2:15:24] devil going to shut me up. It's your
[2:15:26] time to speak. It's your time to speak,
[2:15:29] Judah. It's your time to speak. It's
[2:15:32] your time to speak. It's your time to
[2:15:34] slay the enemy with a word of faith in
[2:15:38] your mouth.
[2:15:41] [Applause]
[2:15:49] God said there would be a time the true
[2:15:51] word
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; would return to her.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Before a word is a fault. Come on.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; A thought has to be created.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; So God's thoughts become creation when
[2:16:03] it was spoke by word.
[2:16:06] [Applause]
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; That's when he
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; presents it to you
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; as a thought,
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; his thoughts, and it's revealed to you,
[2:16:19] but it's still a thought.
[2:16:22] Direct quote. until you
[2:16:26] speak it.
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:36] So when you speak it, God has revealed
[2:16:40] it and it becomes a divine anchor to
[2:16:43] you.
[2:16:46] Deity will be revealed in human beings
[2:16:50] by bringing to pass the thought of their
[2:16:52] mind. Satan, hear me
[2:16:56] and hear me well. Deity is not in
[2:16:59] heaven. Deity is in St. Mary's. Oh high,
[2:17:02] in a youth camp tonight in the redeemed
[2:17:05] flesh of the new generation of the open
[2:17:08] book. And they've got a word confession.
[2:17:15] Go ahead and say it. Fear, you're
[2:17:16] defeated.
[2:17:18] Nervousness, you're defeated. Go ahead.
[2:17:21] We're in spiritual warfare. Doubt,
[2:17:23] you're defeated.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is that's trying to bind
[2:17:27] you, speak it right now and defeat that
[2:17:30] devil
[2:17:32] [Applause]
[2:17:35] by the word of faith in your mouth. Let
[2:17:38] our musicians come tonight. The word of
[2:17:40] faith is in your mouth.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; The word of faith
[2:17:46] is in this building tonight.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; This is not an emotional platform.
[2:17:51] I have not built a platform for you to
[2:17:53] step on tonight under emotions or
[2:17:55] sensations. I have built a platform by
[2:17:58] the preaching of the message of the hour
[2:18:00] for every son and daughter of this word
[2:18:02] to step up on that platform and have a
[2:18:05] prayer line like you never had before.
[2:18:07] Not a begging prayer line. Not a wish I
[2:18:09] could get it prayer line. Not if I get
[2:18:11] good enough, I'll get it prayer line,
[2:18:12] but an authoritative prayer line. When
[2:18:15] you step on the word and say, God, you
[2:18:18] promised it. See, I don't believe you
[2:18:20] got to go to the prayer line to get it.
[2:18:22] I believe you can get it right now. I
[2:18:23] believe it can fall on you right now.
[2:18:28] I believe it right now, man. I believe
[2:18:30] right now the Holy Ghost can fall in
[2:18:32] this building.
[2:18:34] Satan, I adjure thee in the name of
[2:18:37] Jesus Christ. Give way to the message of
[2:18:40] the hour. Give way to the authority of
[2:18:43] the confession of the open book.
[2:18:49] Thou demon of nervousness, thou demon of
[2:18:51] passing out, thou demon of anxiety, I
[2:18:54] adjure thee in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:18:56] I stand upon the infallibility of the
[2:18:59] spoken word of almighty God and I say,
[2:19:02] house of hell, sufferer, suffer no more,
[2:19:06] arise and be healed in the name of Jesus
[2:19:09] Christ.
[2:19:12] [Applause]
[2:19:21] Get out.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, devil. Get out.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Devil, get out. Get out. While the
[2:19:31] getting out's good.
[2:19:34] [Music]
[2:19:41] So, you know how I can
[2:19:44] you know how I can say that? You know
[2:19:46] how I can say that, brother Daniel? It's
[2:19:47] cuz I know while I'm preaching the word
[2:19:49] of faith is working.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not a crazy man. I'm a message
[2:19:54] believer.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; I believe
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; is it okay?
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; I I believe I believe people people want
[2:20:03] to label us Pentecostal for having
[2:20:05] prayer lines, but but we we don't just
[2:20:07] always have prayer lines. We have prayer
[2:20:09] lines/ testimony lines.
[2:20:13] [Applause]
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; We don't just have prayer lines, brother
[2:20:22] Kevin.
[2:20:24] Sometimes by the time you get to the
[2:20:25] head of that prayer line, your desires
[2:20:28] already become a reality and you just go
[2:20:30] through the prayer line saying, "Thank
[2:20:31] God, it's settled. I believe it. I'm
[2:20:35] healed. I'm delivered. I'm forgiven. I'm
[2:20:38] justified. I got a revelation in the
[2:20:41] depths of my soul. I come from God and
[2:20:44] I'm going back to God.
[2:20:47] I believe you walk through that prayer
[2:20:48] line putting your foot on nervousness. I
[2:20:50] believe you can walk to this prayer line
[2:20:52] putting your foot on pornography.
[2:20:56] Put your foot on it, young people.
[2:20:58] You're anointed by the word of faith to
[2:20:59] do it.
[2:21:03] [Music]
[2:21:03] [Applause]
[2:21:07] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Put your foot
[2:21:09] on that devil.
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:19] I say this for the glory of God. That
[2:21:21] demon of nervousness is in trouble
[2:21:22] tonight.
[2:21:24] [Applause]
[2:21:28] I study a prophet and he said
[2:21:31] nervousness is worse than cancer.
[2:21:34] He said, "It controls you. It grips
[2:21:36] you." He said, "But do you believe me to
[2:21:38] be God's servant?"
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet?
[2:21:44] Then nervousness turned loose.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Demons are real.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; I didn't just meet him yesterday.
[2:21:58] I tell you right now, if you don't put
[2:21:59] that foot on that nervousness right now,
[2:22:01] it'll control your marriage. It'll
[2:22:03] control your children. It'll control
[2:22:05] your future. It's a devil.
[2:22:09] [Applause]
[2:22:11] [Music]
[2:22:14] I'm sorry, brother Wayne. I'm going too
[2:22:15] long. And it works in the realm of
[2:22:19] imagination.
[2:22:22] You know that, brother. It works in the
[2:22:24] realm of imagination. Some of the things
[2:22:27] you're afraid of are things you're
[2:22:28] imagining. They're not even real,
[2:22:31] [Applause]
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; but you've imagined them so long
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; that they become real to you.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; I was over in New Zealand one night
[2:22:44] while I was preaching in a meeting one
[2:22:46] morning. I said, "Listen, that demon of
[2:22:48] fear is right here and it's a it's a
[2:22:49] wicked devil. I'm I'm I'm done right
[2:22:51] here. I'm I'm punching devils."
[2:22:54] I said, "It's a wicked demon." And I
[2:22:56] said, "It'll destroy you. It'll destroy
[2:22:58] your marriage. It'll destroy your
[2:22:59] family."
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; I said, "God is your go-betweeneteen in
[2:23:03] the time of trouble." Uh, can you give
[2:23:05] me that picture? The pillar of fire. I
[2:23:06] put it up there and there was a cloud
[2:23:07] over brother's head. I said, "Do you see
[2:23:10] this pillar of fire right here?"
[2:23:12] I said, "The pillar of fire you see in
[2:23:14] that right there it is. That pillar of
[2:23:15] fire you see in that picture." I said,
[2:23:16] "That pillar of fire stands between you
[2:23:18] and trouble." I said, "It's your goeteen
[2:23:21] in the time of trouble." I said, "It
[2:23:23] stands between things that's trying to
[2:23:25] kill you and won't let them get near
[2:23:27] you."
[2:23:30] And when I said that, Brother Josh, the
[2:23:31] power of God dropped in that building.
[2:23:33] And there was a mama in the back corner.
[2:23:35] She raised her hand and begin to scream.
[2:23:37] She began to worship God. We got up to
[2:23:39] the cafeteria afterwards. She grabbed
[2:23:41] the microphone. She said, she said, "I
[2:23:43] want to testify." She said, "Ever since
[2:23:44] I was a little girl," she said,
[2:23:46] "Something happened to me and a fear got
[2:23:48] a hold of me." And she said, "I've
[2:23:50] always lived with this fear. I'm going
[2:23:52] to die in a car wreck. She said, "That's
[2:23:54] the fear I've lived." She said, "Let me
[2:23:56] tell you all how real that fear become."
[2:23:58] She said, "When I left to come to this
[2:23:59] camp, I didn't want to come cuz the
[2:24:01] devil told me I was going to die in a
[2:24:02] car wreck on the way here." You know
[2:24:04] what she said? She said, "I wrote out a
[2:24:06] letter. I put it underneath my bed who I
[2:24:09] wanted to raise my kids and what I
[2:24:11] wanted them to do." She said, "Cuz I
[2:24:13] knew we were going to be killed in a car
[2:24:14] wreck." She said, "But while the word of
[2:24:16] God Oh, God. Thank you, Jesus." She said
[2:24:19] while the word of God was going forth,
[2:24:21] she said that pillar of fire struck my
[2:24:23] heart and she said that fear is broken.
[2:24:26] She said I will not die. I will live to
[2:24:29] raise my children for the glory of God.
[2:24:33] Brother, that same God is right here in
[2:24:37] this building tonight. Whatever that
[2:24:39] fear is that's bound you, speak the
[2:24:42] word. Confess the word over that fear.
[2:24:48] I stood right down there at brother Tim
[2:24:49] Puit in Louisiana at the youth camp and
[2:24:51] told that testimony and a little woman
[2:24:53] sitting about the same spot come to me.
[2:24:55] She said, "Brother Andrew," she said,
[2:24:56] "We had a kid late in life and she said,
[2:24:58] "That devil's gripping my heart. That
[2:25:00] demon of fear and we're not going to
[2:25:01] live long enough to raise our child."
[2:25:03] She said, "But this morning, while the
[2:25:05] word was going forth, she said that
[2:25:08] spirit broke me."
[2:25:11] She said, "That spirit of God broke that
[2:25:13] spirit off of me." She said, "I want to
[2:25:15] confess it. I'm going to raise my child
[2:25:19] for the
[2:25:24] in your mouth.
[2:25:26] [Music]
[2:25:29] Where's Brother Matthew Clinton? Raise
[2:25:31] your hand high. Both of them. I can't
[2:25:32] find you. Right there he is. Just the
[2:25:35] other day, I'm not going to tell the
[2:25:36] whole testimony, but just the other day,
[2:25:38] he had a had a had an episode in his
[2:25:39] chest, and he honestly said, "I felt
[2:25:41] like I was dying. It's okay to share."
[2:25:44] He said, "I went home, got my affairs in
[2:25:45] order and everything." He said, "It was
[2:25:47] like a spirit of fear just gripped me."
[2:25:49] He said it was, he said, "I couldn't
[2:25:50] breathe. Went to the doctor, they
[2:25:51] couldn't find nothing. Wanted to do a
[2:25:53] test." And he said this. He said, "They
[2:25:55] found some calcium in the widowmaker
[2:25:57] artery." He said, "And they it was the
[2:25:59] worst one." He said, "But then I think
[2:26:01] it was in a service and the preacher was
[2:26:02] preaching and the Holy Ghost spoke to
[2:26:04] him." He said, "They went back and done
[2:26:06] the scan, said the widowmaker was full.
[2:26:07] They did another scan and said there was
[2:26:09] nothing in the artery.
[2:26:14] Now, I know intellectual devils. I know
[2:26:17] scientific devils and they want to say,
[2:26:19] "Well, they made a mistake when they did
[2:26:22] the first test, and there's no way that
[2:26:24] could be." Don't you give your mouth to
[2:26:27] that scientific devil. You stand up on
[2:26:29] the word of God and say, "It was there,
[2:26:32] but the word of faith come across his
[2:26:34] heart and removed it."
[2:26:40] that God is in this building tonight.
[2:26:43] Play that audio clip, please. God bless
[2:26:45] you.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; I pray every father with all my heart
[2:26:49] that you'll break every feeder of
[2:26:51] unbelief.
[2:26:52] Have every single spirit. May they not
[2:26:55] be able to stand
[2:26:57] right away. May the pure unadulterated
[2:27:02] faith in God being hard to account. May
[2:27:06] the devil be defeated in our lives. And
[2:27:09] we know he is defeated because he is a
[2:27:13] deceit being demon.
[2:27:15] And Satan, I turn to you now to say this
[2:27:18] that you are defeated.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; You're not afraid of us, but you're
[2:27:21] afraid of the ones we're speaking about.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; You have lost every bit of power you
[2:27:27] ever had. You were defeated in power.
[2:27:30] Jesus Christ, God's son, climbs over
[2:27:33] every enemy. He conquered all sickness,
[2:27:36] all death, hell, and grave. and
[2:27:38] conquered every victory that you've ever
[2:27:40] had and you're nothing but a blood and
[2:27:43] we're calling your blood tonight in the
[2:27:46] name of Jesus Christ
[2:27:50] and second
[2:27:53] power of God presence

[2:28:11] be told of Satan and God has received
[2:28:15] it. We know that it's we ask that in
[2:28:19] Jesus Christ
[2:28:21] for God
[2:28:24] and just stay with God. Just believe now
[2:28:28] with all your heart. Lord, I believe
[2:28:31] that you can heal me.
[2:28:34] I believe because I laid my hands on
[2:28:36] this man here. He laid his hands on me,
[2:28:38] on this woman. He laid her hands on me.
[2:28:41] I was led to do that. I was led to lay
[2:28:44] my hands on this person. They were led
[2:28:46] to lay her hands on me. The same Holy
[2:28:48] Ghost that this whole state of led me to
[2:28:52] do this while we're right here in this
[2:28:54] place. Now I believe you are Satan.
[2:28:58] Get away from me right now because I'm
[2:29:01] sealed Abraham by Jesus Christ and I
[2:29:03] take
[2:29:08] all things.
