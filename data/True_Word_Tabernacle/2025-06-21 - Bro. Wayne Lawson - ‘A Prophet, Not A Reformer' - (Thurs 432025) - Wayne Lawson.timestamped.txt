[0:00] Where would I be?
[0:05] You only know.
[0:10] I'm glad you see as brother Wayne comes
[0:15] through out of love.
[0:22] A hopeless cave,
[0:27] an empty
[0:29] place.
[0:31] Oh, if not
[0:34] for grave, where would I be? Where would
[0:38] I be?
[0:42] You only know.
[0:47] I'm glad you see.
[0:52] Through eyes of love,
[0:57] a hopeless case,
[1:03] an empty
[1:05] is not.
[1:10] Oh, let's sing. Amazing grace.
[1:13] Amazing
[1:14] grace,
[1:16] how sweet, how sweet the sound
[1:23] I once was.
[1:28] But now I'm found
[1:33] a hopeless
[1:35] case.
[1:39] An empty
[1:41] place if God.
[1:45] Oh, where would I be?
[1:49] Where would I be?
[1:53] You only know.
[1:59] You only see
[2:02] it through eyes of love.
[2:09] A hopeless case,
[2:14] an empty
[2:16] place.
[2:18] Oh, if not for grace.
[2:24] Oh precious Lord,
[2:30] take my hand.
[2:35] Lead me on.
[2:40] Let me stand.
[2:45] A hopeless case,
[2:50] an empty
[2:52] space if God.
[2:55] [Music]
[2:56] Oh, amazing grace.
[3:00] Amazing
[3:02] grace,
[3:03] [Music]
[3:05] how sweet the sound
[3:10] I once was.
[3:16] But now I'm
[3:26] in an empty place.
[3:31] Oh, if it
[3:33] gra.
[3:38] Amen. If it wasn't for his grace. Amen.
[3:42] There's a little song on my heart that
[3:43] we we sing once in a while. And I will
[3:46] praise the Lord.
[3:48] I don't know what to do. I will praise
[3:52] the Lord.

[3:59] will praise
[4:02] the Lord

[4:12] what it has in store.
[4:16] I know I
[4:19] will praise
[4:21] the Lord.
[4:25] Yes, I
[4:28] will praise
[4:30] the Lord.
[4:32] [Music]
[4:36] I
[4:37] will praise
[4:40] the Lord.
[4:45] No matter what you want to bring,
[4:50] why it has sto.
[5:01] [Music]
[5:06] Amen. Well, certainly what we're going
[5:08] to do is we're going to praise the Lord.
[5:10] Amen. Amen. In the good times and in the
[5:13] bad. Amen. Amen. We certainly want to
[5:16] thank each of you that is able to be
[5:17] here tonight and say God bless you and a
[5:20] special blessing to you. I know it's a
[5:22] Thursday night and a week in the middle
[5:24] of the week. Many of you have worked and
[5:26] been here, but we thank the Lord you was
[5:28] able to be out here tonight and support
[5:31] of the word of God. We certainly thank
[5:32] you. God bless you, Sister Martin. Sure

[5:40] certainly praying tonight for the
[5:42] Johnson family and Amen. Brother
[5:44] Samuel's uh life and long wonderful
[5:47] life, full life. Amen. But his his
[5:51] family, you know, brother Mark and
[5:52] Sister Lucille and the families and

[6:02] we thank God for his life and and for
[6:05] that family. Amen. what they mean to the
[6:08] message of the hour. Amen.
[6:10] Amen. Tonight, we just want to, if we
[6:12] could, just before we go to the word,
[6:15] let's just bow our hearts. Amen.
[6:17] Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight
[6:20] for the grace that you have given, Lord.
[6:23] We thank you for this congregation that
[6:24] you have gathered in here in this room
[6:26] tonight, Lord, knowing that, Father,
[6:29] that your mercy, Lord, has called them,
[6:33] has spoke to them, Lord. assembled them
[6:35] together, Lord, around your word. And we
[6:38] just ask you tonight, Lord, that as you
[6:41] are here, Lord, in our midst, by
[6:43] promise, you made it, Lord. You said
[6:46] where two or three are gathered in my
[6:47] name. And we ask you now, Lord, as we
[6:50] make you welcome here among us tonight,
[6:53] that your great spirit would have
[6:54] preeminence, Lord, that you would take
[6:57] over the realm of this atmosphere and
[6:59] this people, Lord, and that you would
[7:01] walk the aisles of the building tonight,
[7:03] Lord. And Father, as we endeavor to
[7:05] speak something on your word, but we ask
[7:08] you, Lord, that you would just unveil it
[7:10] to each heart and the spirit of
[7:12] revelation and wisdom would move in
[7:14] tonight, Lord. and may it quicken us to
[7:17] what your word has been meant for us in
[7:19] this season, Lord. Now, Lord, we ask you
[7:22] for these things tonight, believing.
[7:24] Father, we ask it in the mighty name of
[7:26] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen.
[7:30] And and God bless you tonight. If you
[7:33] have your Bibles, Amen. Amen. If you
[7:35] have your Bibles, Amen. Let's turn to
[7:38] Revelations the 6th chapter and let's
[7:40] look in the first verse. Revelation
[7:42] chapter 6 and verse one.
[7:45] Amen. Revelation 6 and verse one.
[7:50] I'm going to be continuing on this uh
[7:53] thought of the opening of the word and
[7:55] but I'm I'm just moved into this the
[7:57] Revelations contained under the seals
[7:59] and instead of having two or three
[8:00] titles, I'm just going to go to this
[8:02] Revelations contained under the seals.
[8:04] But we're still on the same uh thought
[8:06] as we was before. Amen. Just uh just
[8:09] going and under it. This will be part
[8:11] two. Amen. Sunday we was on that. And
[8:14] Amen. If we can look in Revelations the
[8:17] 6th chapter and the first verse. Amen.
[8:22] Revelation 6 and1. And I saw when the
[8:25] lamb had opened one of the seals and I
[8:28] heard as it was the noise of a thunder.
[8:32] Now one of the four beasts saying, "Come
[8:35] and see. And I saw, and behold, a white
[8:39] horse, and he that set up on him had a
[8:43] bow, and a crown was given unto him, and
[8:47] he went forth conquering
[8:49] and to conquer. May God bless his word
[8:52] tonight as you could be seated. Amen.
[8:54] The EQ in my ear is a little off, Ben.
[8:56] It's maybe too bassy, I think.
[9:00] Um, Revelations 6 and 1 and two. Amen.
[9:04] looking at this tonight at the the
[9:06] revelations contained under the seals.
[9:09] Now, I I love how Brother Brandham
[9:12] approaches these things when he says
[9:15] it's the ministry of the seventh angel
[9:17] to solve out these mysteries. Amen. So,
[9:20] now we know, amen, that the ministry of
[9:23] the prophet was to solve out these
[9:25] mysteries. Amen. And to give them to us,
[9:27] amen. So that they're no longer uh
[9:30] standing in a symbol form. A uh we have
[9:33] read this quote several times and I want
[9:35] to continue reading it throughout this
[9:36] series because I I want I want it to
[9:39] just sink in our hearts where it's just
[9:42] where it's just so simple when someone
[9:44] says to us the third pull. Uh, of
[9:47] course, brother Brandon will say it.
[9:48] He'll say, "Now listen, not now the very
[9:51] day when this messenger, not when he
[9:53] starts, but when he declares his
[9:55] message, the first pull is a healing and
[9:58] the second pull is a prophesying, but
[10:00] the third pull is the opening of the
[10:03] word." So when you say, someone says to
[10:05] you, well, the third pull, it's the
[10:08] opening of the word. Amen. The third
[10:11] pull is the opening of the word. It's
[10:13] the mysteries revealed. Now there is no
[10:15] higher order to reveal the word than a
[10:19] prophet. But the only way a prophet can
[10:21] be vindicated is by the word. And
[10:24] remember the third pull was the opening
[10:27] of them seven seals. Amen. So the
[10:30] opening of the word is the opening of
[10:32] seven seals to reveal the hidden truth
[10:36] that's been sealed in the word. So it
[10:38] won't be something that is not written.
[10:40] It was something that was written but
[10:42] yet hidden. But it took a prophet to
[10:45] bring it out so that the church could
[10:46] see it. Now that was exactly uh what the
[10:50] ministry of brother Brandham his was to
[10:52] do. Now he had a first pull and he had a
[10:54] second pull and most of the world was
[10:57] easily went with him on the first and
[10:59] the second. But when it come to that
[11:01] third pull that was the part, amen, that
[11:03] they would back away from. They wanted
[11:06] to get away from that because, amen,
[11:08] denominational systems and schools had
[11:11] been set up to tell us what the Bible
[11:13] means. Theologians had studied their
[11:15] whole lives in education and societies.
[11:18] And here come a humble man with a sixth
[11:20] grade education without denomination as
[11:23] like Elijah coming out of the
[11:25] wilderness. And he comes saying, "This
[11:27] means this and this means this and this
[11:30] means this." And they said, "What school
[11:31] did you come from?" He said, "By God's
[11:33] grace, none of them." Amen. He was
[11:35] schooled out on the back side of the
[11:37] desert meeting the angel of the Lord.
[11:39] You know, remember that time a fellow
[11:40] tried to tell brother Brandham about the
[11:42] Godhead and he said, "You don't
[11:44] understand." Brother Bam said, "What
[11:45] what is the Godhead? What's it mean?" He
[11:47] said, "Well, it's three persons." He he
[11:49] said, "And one God." Brother Bam said,
[11:50] "What school did you go to?" Amen. Three
[11:53] persons and one God. He said, "See, you
[11:55] you couldn't have got that out of the
[11:57] Bible or you couldn't have got it out of
[11:59] the gospel. You'd have had to got that
[12:00] out of a school somewhere." And Amen.
[12:02] They'd had to taught that into you
[12:04] because just common sense would tell you
[12:06] that that a person is a personality and
[12:08] you can't have three personalities and
[12:10] one God. Amen. Amen. So he was just he
[12:13] was just real simple and he said things
[12:15] real simple but the profound depth was
[12:18] he was absolutely right.
[12:22] Amen. He was absolutely right. And I
[12:24] love it how he begins in the first se
[12:26] seal by saying to us, I'm positive sure
[12:29] tonight that we have the revelation on
[12:32] this seal. Amen. Now, brother Bam will
[12:35] actually tell us this because he said
[12:36] the lamb is standing now tonight in the
[12:39] sixth chapter and he's got his book in
[12:42] his hand and he's starting to reveal it.
[12:44] Now, here, Brother Brand begins to
[12:46] preach the seals, the opening of the
[12:48] word, and he's telling the church, the
[12:50] lamb has the book in his hand tonight,
[12:52] and he's starting to reveal it. Amen.
[12:54] So, he's letting you know that he has
[12:57] been in contact with God concerning the
[12:59] opening of this book, and he's going to
[13:02] start revealing it now. And under the
[13:04] revelation that was coming to him,
[13:07] Amen., And brother Brandham was going to
[13:08] lay out something very powerful of for
[13:10] us is that the messenger that was to
[13:13] preach these things was not going to
[13:16] start a church.
[13:18] Isn't that amazing? Brother Bam says I'm
[13:20] not going to start a church. Amen. He
[13:22] said now all these others he said that
[13:24] have come up he says but this man this
[13:27] this messenger that is to reveal these
[13:30] things he's not going to start a
[13:32] denomination. So the minute someone
[13:34] begins with that denominational spirit,
[13:36] it's not the message of the hour. Amen.
[13:39] Now I know that they they have formed
[13:41] all kinds of messages or denominations
[13:44] around the church and around the message
[13:45] and they don't call them denominations,
[13:47] but they're glass walls, right? Amen.
[13:49] They they form they get a they get a
[13:51] form or an idea and then if you don't
[13:53] fit in that, then you can't fellowship
[13:55] with us. Amen. That's kind of a a
[13:58] concept, but it never was one that the
[14:00] prophet brought to us. It was one that
[14:03] was developed under the same spirit that
[14:06] began with the first seal when the horse
[14:08] rider come with an antichrist teaching
[14:10] or a doctrine. Amen. Now watch what
[14:12] happens. Brother Mam says this one won't
[14:14] start a church because this is the
[14:16] Leoysia church age. is the last age and
[14:19] the messenger of the seventh angel which
[14:21] is the seventh messenger of the seventh
[14:23] church is the fellow that's going to
[14:25] reveal by the holy spirit these
[14:28] mysterious things and he's going to how
[14:30] many he was here last night brother
[14:32] preached the breach he said now listen
[14:34] there you'll see it in the 10th chapter
[14:37] all right the reformers come to reform
[14:39] the last fallen church age preceding
[14:42] them he says then after the reformers
[14:45] come and reform the church age he said
[14:47] it went right back into the world and
[14:50] then they started a new church age. They
[14:53] always done it. They always did. They
[14:55] went through it. See, in other words,
[14:57] here come the Catholic church age of the
[14:59] Roman Catholic Church. Here come along
[15:00] Luther. He was a reformer. Amen. And
[15:03] what does he do? He starts right there
[15:05] hammering away. And when he does, he
[15:08] protests the church. And the first thing
[15:10] you know, Amen. What does he do? He
[15:12] builds the same thing that he d come out
[15:15] to drive out another church. Now I I'll
[15:19] get to this later maybe, but the prophet
[15:21] will say that of course Revelation 17
[15:23] talks about the and her daughters.
[15:25] And brother Bam said, "What's a daughter
[15:27] is something that come out of
[15:28] something." He said, "So you see the
[15:30] daughter was a was a Protestant that had
[15:33] come out of the harlot." Amen. But
[15:35] because they were reformers, they went
[15:37] right back to the same harlotry that
[15:39] their mother had committed, which was
[15:41] denominationalism.
[15:43] Amen. Now watch what he says. See, he
[15:45] says, see, reformers come along. He
[15:47] says, and they hammer, he says, but they
[15:49] hammer away and they protest it. But the
[15:51] first thing you know, what does he do?
[15:53] He builds the same thing that he come
[15:55] out of. He said, then they have another
[15:57] church age. Then the first thing you
[15:59] know, the church age is a mess. And
[16:00] along comes John Wesley, another
[16:02] reformer. And he builds another church
[16:04] age. Get what I mean? Another church age
[16:06] is built up. They're all reformers. He
[16:09] says, "Notice this last message of the
[16:11] last church age is not a reformer. He's
[16:15] a prophet.
[16:16] He's not a reformer. He's a prophet."
[16:19] Now, in paragraph 192, let's just start
[16:21] for the next couple paragraphs and watch
[16:23] what Brother Bam does. He's not a
[16:25] reformer. He's a prophet. He's not a
[16:28] reformer. Show me one prophet that ever
[16:30] started a church age. He's a reformer.
[16:33] Amen. He's not a reformer. He's a
[16:35] prophet. Amen. Others were reformers,
[16:37] but not prophets. Amen. If you would
[16:40] have been, the word of the Lord comes to
[16:42] the prophets. That's the reason they
[16:44] continued on in the baptism and the
[16:46] father, son, and the holy ghost and all
[16:47] these other things because they were
[16:49] reformers, not prophets. Amen. But yet
[16:52] you were great men of God. saw the need
[16:54] of the day. They lived in and anointed
[16:56] them and they sent out there and tore
[16:57] those things to pieces, but full of the
[16:59] word of God never came because they were
[17:02] not prophets. They were reformers.
[17:04] That's 12 different times in just a very
[17:06] short spot. He says to you, they were
[17:09] reformers. They were not prophets. They
[17:11] were reformers. They were not prophets.
[17:13] That's how that they could go in and
[17:15] like the Roman church, they could so
[17:18] protest against what was going on in the
[17:20] church, but then they could continue
[17:22] right on with trinitarian doctrine. So
[17:24] today, people who who look at the
[17:27] message and maybe they come from a
[17:28] Lutheran background or they come from
[17:30] the reformation of the early ages and
[17:32] and they'll agree right with us on
[17:34] communion, but when it comes to the
[17:35] godhead, they're lost because their
[17:37] reformation could not solve out what the
[17:40] godhead was on the baptism and things.
[17:43] So they continued right on smoking a
[17:44] pipe and Luther went right on drinking.
[17:47] He went on right on with trinitarian
[17:48] doctrines. But he was a part of the
[17:50] reformation that brought the church out
[17:52] so far. But but then it just created
[17:56] another church. And brother Bam says,
[17:57] "Watch John Wesley doing the same thing.
[18:00] He reformed it out." He he said, "Well,
[18:02] if the same God that justifies you is
[18:04] the same God that'll sanctify you."
[18:06] Amen. Amen. I That'd probably be a good
[18:08] message to preach in this generation,
[18:10] wouldn't it? The same God that justifies
[18:12] you is the same God that sanctifies you.
[18:14] But under that sanctification message,
[18:17] they still had a trinitarian doctrine.
[18:19] They could not receive the nine
[18:21] spiritual gifts that Paul had put in the
[18:23] church. Amen. And yet, Amen. They were a
[18:26] church, but they were not they were not
[18:28] a church under revelation. They were a
[18:31] church under reformation because Luther
[18:34] was a reformer and Wesley was a
[18:36] reformer. They come from God, but they
[18:39] were reformers. But the Bible made a
[18:41] prediction that the last messenger would
[18:44] be a prophet. Amen. And being a prophet,
[18:47] brother Bam says he'll have to be a
[18:48] prophet to take up these mysteries.
[18:51] Amen. Because the mysteries can only be
[18:53] known by a prophet. Now, I'm going to
[18:54] slip in the second seal for a moment
[18:55] with you. And brother Bam says, "Now,
[18:57] how does God reveal his secrets or his
[19:01] mysteries? He does it according to the
[19:04] Bible in Amos the 3 chapter." Amen.
[19:07] Amen. Surely the Lord our God would do
[19:09] nothing until first he reveals it, his
[19:13] servants, the prophets. Surely God would
[19:15] do nothing. Now, if we're looking at the
[19:17] end of the world and we are looking at
[19:19] the challenge of the age we're living
[19:21] in, of tribulation and Israel being
[19:24] restored and the world falling apart,
[19:26] surely if God's about to do something,
[19:29] wouldn't there had to been a prophet?
[19:31] Amen. We've had reformers. We've had
[19:33] good churches. We've had it. But we
[19:35] didn't have a prophet. Amen. But God
[19:38] made a promise for a prophet. Amen. He
[19:41] made a biblical promise for a prophet.
[19:43] And in Revelation chapter 7, you'll see
[19:46] then or Revelation chapter 10, you'll
[19:48] see in the seventh verse that the
[19:50] seventh angel has to be a prophet
[19:54] because he's going to give the mystery
[19:57] secrets of God. Now, I love how Brother
[19:59] Bam really breaks it down because he
[20:01] said the mysteries he's solving here is
[20:03] the word. He says, see, it's the secrets
[20:07] of God. And I love how he says it. It's
[20:10] the love secrets. Yeah. He calls it the
[20:12] love secrets. Remember Christ the
[20:14] mystery. He's unfolding his love secrets
[20:17] and that's how he gets her closer to him
[20:19] all the time. So the more that he
[20:22] unlaces his word, the closer you get to
[20:25] God. That's right. Isn't that amazing?
[20:28] The more word and I don't have a good
[20:30] way to say it, but I'll say it a couple
[20:31] times. You'll catch it. Amen. The the
[20:33] more he unfolds his word, the closer you
[20:36] get to God. Amen. Because reformers left
[20:40] you separate from God. But under a
[20:43] prophet's revelation, you was in the
[20:45] mind of God as a part of God. And as the
[20:49] word is unfolded out, you begin to
[20:52] realize that you were a part of God from
[20:55] the beginning. But without a prophet,
[20:57] you can't get that close to God. Amen.
[21:00] But as you see, Amen. reformers Luther
[21:03] and Wesley. Look how far they didn't
[21:06] look anything like the original. But as
[21:08] the word be to be revealed through a
[21:10] prophet, it put you in a perfect image
[21:13] that was in the mind of God from the
[21:16] beginning or the foundation of the
[21:18] world. See, the full word never came to
[21:20] them because they were not prophets. So,
[21:22] amen. If you're if you're in here
[21:24] tonight and you study theology or you
[21:26] got family and they're around, they
[21:27] said, "Well, why is it that only Brother
[21:29] Brandham preached this and so and and
[21:31] and the Lutheran didn't or the Wesleyans
[21:33] didn't or the Pentecostals didn't?" It's
[21:35] because they were reformers. They wasn't
[21:38] prophets.
[21:40] Amen. Now watch this because you can
[21:41] even watch the Pentecostals come and how
[21:44] they caught the godhead right there in
[21:45] the 1900s, early 1900s. They started
[21:48] catching the water baptism and the deity
[21:50] of Jesus Christ begin to restore under
[21:52] his name, but they still had their women
[21:54] preachers. They still had confusion and
[21:57] all the gifts and things. And Amen. My
[21:59] my in-laws sitting here, Brother Vernon,
[22:01] was a part of that Pentecostal church
[22:02] early on. Amen. He can tell you a lot of
[22:04] stories about some of the things, amen,
[22:06] that was done in those churches. And and
[22:08] and I thank God for people that that had
[22:11] been in those Pentecostal churches and
[22:13] had come out under the message cuz they
[22:15] can flat tell you that what we got right
[22:17] here is not a zoo of Pentecost. This is
[22:19] produced by the message of the hour. As
[22:22] I promise you this, you preach one of
[22:24] these sermons in a Pentecostal church
[22:26] and you would find out that this is not
[22:27] Pentecostal. Amen. This is the seed that
[22:30] was hid in the shock. And when the seed
[22:33] began to develop, the shuck said, "We
[22:34] don't want you no more as long as it was
[22:37] under the first pool. Everybody could
[22:39] shout." Under the second pool, oh,
[22:41] there's great revival everywhere. But
[22:43] when the third pull began to come, the
[22:46] sun begin to call for the ripening of
[22:48] the grain. And the grain begin to
[22:50] declare its independence from the rest
[22:52] of the of the plant. Amen. Because it
[22:54] had the original life. It's not just
[22:57] going to produce a tassel. It won't just
[22:59] produce a stock, but it'll produce
[23:02] everything that was in the original seed
[23:05] all the way back to the word of God. Oh,
[23:07] I thank God tonight for that original
[23:09] word. For that original seed, my Amen. I
[23:14] I I I I don't want to get too spread
[23:15] out, but I'll just throw something to
[23:17] you. Amen. How do you know the
[23:18] difference between Cain and Abel?
[23:20] Brother man said it was that original
[23:22] seed. See, it was the that was the
[23:25] difference. They were both worshippers.
[23:26] They both went to an altar. They were
[23:28] twins out of the same womb. And even
[23:31] even said, "Cain was a man from the
[23:34] Lord." Do you see what the church will
[23:36] do? It'll hybridize and bring forth a
[23:39] child and call it of God, but it'll
[23:41] never be able to meet the sacrifice and
[23:44] it'll always be intellectual and it will
[23:47] always persecute the original seed.
[23:50] Hallelujah. And I'm glad tonight to know
[23:53] that there is a difference between the
[23:55] original seed and the hybridization of
[23:58] people taking the message or taking the
[24:00] Bible, putting it together, and it
[24:02] always persecutes.
[24:04] My goodness. I I stand here today and I
[24:07] I was listening to the prophet today and
[24:08] he said this. He said, "You show me one
[24:10] place in the Bible that the
[24:12] intellectuals ever spoke for God." He
[24:14] said, "They always fought God. They were
[24:16] always against God." He said, "And
[24:18] that's the very ones that put him on the
[24:20] cross." Amen. And spirits don't die. And
[24:24] the very ones that are crucifying the
[24:27] message of the hour is intellectuals in
[24:29] this age hybridizing the word of God.
[24:32] Amen. Through reformations and ideas of
[24:35] man. Oh, but God sent a prophet for an
[24:38] original seed, for original church, for
[24:41] an original bride. There's only one way.
[24:44] It's through that original word. Thank
[24:46] you, Lord. It's the full word of God and
[24:49] it can never come to them because they
[24:50] were not prophets.
[24:53] Looking at the bride and asking it why
[24:55] it don't believe like the Lutherans is
[24:57] like the seed looking at the stalk.
[25:00] Why aren't you like us?
[25:03] Well, it's because we have seen an
[25:05] advancement
[25:06] in the word. We we believe the
[25:08] reformation. And you'd be surprised at
[25:11] how some of the Lutheran or the
[25:13] Presbyterians believe in justification
[25:15] just like you do
[25:18] and maybe do a better job in saying it
[25:20] sometimes because it's all they got.
[25:24] Say it real strong. They really do.
[25:26] They're real strong on that point. But
[25:28] it's funny is because even the Lutheran
[25:31] and the Presbyterians that came out
[25:32] under that reformation, do you know they
[25:35] they actually exalt St. Augustine of
[25:37] Hippo? They actually exalt him. They
[25:40] think he's a great hero among them.
[25:43] But see, it was under reformation. Yeah.
[25:47] Because when a prophet come along, we
[25:48] found out different, didn't we? Watch
[25:51] this. Brother Bam said, "The last days,
[25:52] it'll have to be a prophet that'll take
[25:54] up these mysteries to bring it back."
[25:57] Now, people ask, "Why do we need a
[25:59] prophet?" See, the mysteries has to be a
[26:02] prophet because it was only known to the
[26:04] prophets. It has to be. See what I mean?
[26:07] He can't be a reformer. It's got to be a
[26:10] prophet.
[26:12] Because it's got to be somebody that's
[26:14] gifted and set there that catches that
[26:16] word. See, the reformers know there was
[26:19] something wrong. Luther knowed that. He
[26:21] knew the bread wasn't the body. And so
[26:23] he preached just shall live by faith.
[26:25] That was his message. And when John
[26:26] Wesley come along, he saw the
[26:28] sanctification. So he preached it. That
[26:30] was his message. The Pentecostals
[26:32] brought in the message of the Holy Ghost
[26:33] and so forth. But in the last days, in
[26:36] the last age, the messenger is to not
[26:38] start any reformation, but he is to take
[26:41] all the mysteries that reformers left
[26:43] off and gather them and saw them out to
[26:47] the people. The ministry of William
[26:49] Brham, the third pull, is to take all
[26:53] these things and saw them out for the
[26:56] church. That's right. As gifted as he
[26:59] was, as much vindication as he had, as
[27:03] much healing and visions that he gave
[27:05] the church was only vindications
[27:09] that he would be able to have a voice
[27:11] that would follow the sign.
[27:14] That's why brother Brandham said anybody
[27:16] that tries to have this type of
[27:18] ministry, if they go right on down the
[27:21] regular course of teaching, it doesn't
[27:23] come from God.
[27:25] because he's showing you if God's doing
[27:27] this, it's because he's going to do
[27:30] something. He's going to say something.
[27:32] How many of you ever heard the message,
[27:34] the voice behind the sign or the voice
[27:37] of the sign? Now, they call it a voice
[27:39] of the sign, but what that really means
[27:40] is there was a sign and there's a
[27:42] message follows it. And if you believe
[27:45] the sign, believe the message. If if
[27:48] it's a true sign, it has a true message.
[27:51] And I say it was true. Very true. Amen.
[27:54] And he's to reveal the truth of it. See,
[27:56] now watch. That's why that they could
[27:59] smoke a pipe, do what they were doing.
[28:01] Amen. And treat. Now, now, Brother Bam
[28:03] does a tremendous job here separating a
[28:06] prophet from a reformer. Yeah. He does a
[28:10] tremendous job. And he's doing it for
[28:11] you and I. Now, when we go back on these
[28:14] tapes and things, he's helping us
[28:16] understand,
[28:17] amen, that men can be spiritual and men
[28:20] can have gifts, but there's a difference
[28:22] in a reformer and a prophet. Now, watch
[28:26] this because I just done some studying.
[28:28] Brother Bram says it here in the first
[28:30] seal. He said when Martin Luther made
[28:31] the proclamation that all Jews ought to
[28:34] be run off and their buildings burnt
[28:37] down because they were antichrist.
[28:39] Martin Luther made that stealth uh
[28:42] statement himself in writing. Hitler
[28:44] just fulfilled what Martin Luther said.
[28:49] Why? Because he was a reformer,
[28:53] not a prophet.
[28:55] Now I I just went back and Dr. Google.
[28:58] He's he's got a ton of uh uh information
[29:01] for you and and you you actually can
[29:03] read books and sermons written by Martin
[29:06] Luther and and and and some of the uh
[29:09] some of the very works that he has. One
[29:12] on this is the Jews and their liies.
[29:16] That that's a publish that's a
[29:17] publishing of his the Jews and their
[29:19] lives. And the book that he published it
[29:22] in on the front page is a big pig.
[29:26] Yeah, he's saying something cuz the Jews
[29:29] are don't like the pork, you know, and
[29:31] he has a big pig. And Martin Luther, not
[29:33] being a prophet, but his his 65,000
[29:37] words on the Jews and their lies, Amen,
[29:40] was actually published and reprinted
[29:42] five times within his lifetime, written
[29:44] in 1453 years after his death. It is
[29:48] believed that Luther was influenced,
[29:49] Amen. in these and uh he was a uh
[29:52] published uh let me just keep going
[29:53] here. He man um I'm trying to look for
[29:57] the exact wording on this.
[30:00] Luther and the Jews in their blindness
[30:03] wanted nothing to do with faith and
[30:04] justification of faith. So because they
[30:06] wouldn't accept his message. Now what he
[30:09] says here is their lies. He said the
[30:11] Jews are a base whoring people. That is
[30:15] no people of God. Their boast their
[30:17] lineage their circumcision and their law
[30:19] must be accounted as filth. their
[30:22] synagogue is a defiled bride as an
[30:24] incorruptible and an evil
[30:27] Argues that their synagogues and their
[30:30] schools should be set on fire, their
[30:32] prayer books should be destroyed, their
[30:34] rabbis forbidden to preach, their homes
[30:37] raised, their property and money
[30:38] confiscated, and they should be shown no
[30:41] mercy or kindness, afforded no legal
[30:44] protection. these poisonous, envied
[30:47] worms should be drafted into forced
[30:49] labor, expelled for all time. He also is
[30:53] advocating for their murder by writing
[30:55] these words, "We are at fault in not
[30:58] slaying them."
[31:02] Because he was a reformer,
[31:05] not a prophet.
[31:08] You see, a man can preach kind of true.
[31:12] And God blessed the truth that Martin
[31:14] Luther preached, but we are not Lutheran
[31:16] because he was a reformer. He was not a
[31:20] prophet. Do you see there's a huge
[31:23] difference in a prophet and a reformer?
[31:26] Amen. Morris Galilo asked Brother
[31:28] Brandham and said, "Is these Jews
[31:29] Antichrist?" Brother Brandham, "Is the
[31:31] Jew the Antichrist?" I said, "Mors, and
[31:33] you a Jew?" He said, "The greatest
[31:35] god-haters there is, brother Bam
[31:37] Morris." He said, "Tell me in the
[31:39] scripture, where the Antichrist come out
[31:41] of Jerusalem?" The Antichrist come out
[31:43] of Rome, not out of Palestine. He said,
[31:46] "See." He said, "Well, look, they're God
[31:48] haters." He said, "Yes, but didn't God
[31:50] say he blinded their eyes that we might
[31:53] be able to see?" Amen. Now, watch,
[31:56] Brother Bam is saying he's a He said,
[31:58] "Watch now. He was a reformer, not a
[32:00] prophet. My prophet blesses Israel. And
[32:03] whosoever blesses him is blessed. And
[32:05] whosoever curses him and cursed. How can
[32:08] a prophet stand and deny what another
[32:11] prophet said and remain in harmony.
[32:15] Amen. But I'll tell you what it is. The
[32:16] Roman Catholic Church done such a good
[32:18] job of saying the antichrist spirit was
[32:22] something besides themselves that people
[32:25] began to look at the Jews as the very
[32:27] antichrist. And a reformer like Martin
[32:30] Luther didn't have the eyesight to look
[32:33] into the word of God and come out with
[32:35] the answer. Amen. But we've had a
[32:37] prophet in this generation, a revealer
[32:40] of divine truth that has set the thing
[32:43] in order. Look what he says in Isaiah
[32:45] 44. How could you disagree with Isaiah
[32:48] when he said, "Remember, oh Jacob and
[32:49] Israel, for thou art my servant. I have
[32:52] formed thee. Thou art my servant, oh
[32:54] Israel. Thou shalt not be forgotten of
[32:58] me. Hallelujah. If that was just one
[33:01] scripture, but let's go to the other
[33:02] one. In Isaiah 14:49 and 14, but Zion
[33:06] said, Lord, thou hast forsaken me, and
[33:10] my Lord hath forgotten me. He said, "Can
[33:12] a woman forget her suckling child that
[33:14] she could have no compassion on the son
[33:16] of her womb? Yay, they may forget, but
[33:20] yet I will not forget thee. Behold, thou
[33:24] art graven thee upon the palms of my
[33:26] hands, and my walls are continually
[33:29] before me. God can never forget Israel.
[33:33] Amen. Watch what he says in the book of
[33:35] Romans. Paul straightens it out. Said,
[33:37] "I would not, brethren, that you should
[33:39] not be ignorant of this mystery."
[33:40] Brother Bam, when he speaks of this,
[33:42] Amen. in the in the fifth seal, he goes,
[33:44] "Mistry."
[33:47] And he just he just clears this. You
[33:48] watch Brother Bandom when he wants to
[33:50] catch something, he'll clear his throats
[33:51] about three times. Amen. This mystery.
[33:56] What's he doing? He's telling you it's a
[33:59] mystery. This is why it was hid from the
[34:02] reformers, but a prophet, lest you
[34:04] should be wise in your own conceits that
[34:06] blindness is happened to Israel until
[34:09] the fullness of the Gentiles come in.
[34:11] And so all Israel shall be saved. My,
[34:16] don't that make you feel good tonight?
[34:19] All Israel shall be saved. Amen. Now,
[34:23] somebody said, "Brother Wayne, how in
[34:25] the world could all of Israel be saved?"
[34:26] Not all of Israel is Israel, but there
[34:29] is an elected in Israel that shall be
[34:33] saved. And God can never forget them.
[34:37] How could he forget them? Amen. He took
[34:40] him as his firstborn son. He would not
[34:42] forget him. That's what he told Moses. I
[34:45] have remembered my promise 400 years and
[34:48] God had not I tell you what brother
[34:50] Brandham said. He said Moses had
[34:52] forgotten and the burden of it had got
[34:54] so bad on Moses that Moses had forgotten
[34:57] and lost interest in God's people. He
[35:00] said but God was still interested. He
[35:02] said in the pillar of fire come to
[35:04] remind the prophet I have not forgotten
[35:07] my people. I'm going to deliver them and
[35:09] I'll send you to do it. Amen. That same
[35:12] God, he may have been silent for 2,000
[35:14] years, but anybody ought to look up
[35:16] tonight and know, Amen. The same time,
[35:19] Malachi 4, 7th angel, this man, William
[35:22] Brandham, come into the earth, and an
[35:24] angel begin to meet him. At the same
[35:27] time, Israel was becoming a nation again
[35:31] because God hath not forgotten Israel.
[35:35] My goodness. Amen. Watch what he says.
[35:37] Israel shall shall be saved. it is
[35:39] written shall come out of Zion deliver
[35:41] and shall turn away the ungodliness of
[35:43] Jacob for this is my covenant unto them
[35:45] will I take away their sins and
[35:47] concerning the gospel
[35:49] and concerning the gospel
[35:52] Paul's gospel God's gospel
[35:56] concerning the gospel they are enemies
[36:00] for your sakes
[36:03] but as touching the election oh God hey
[36:07] when you talk about the gospel. They're
[36:10] an enemy for the gospel. But if you want
[36:12] to talk about election,
[36:14] if you want to talk about election, God
[36:17] has never forgot Israel. God can't
[36:20] forget Israel. Amen. Said, "Preacher,
[36:22] what's what's wrong with you?" I'll tell
[36:24] you the difference in a reformer and a
[36:25] prophet. That reformer Luther could call
[36:28] them every dirty name. He could curse
[36:30] them. He could say they needed killing.
[36:32] But when God's prophet come along, he
[36:34] stood there and he said, "Oh, Morse,
[36:36] they're not the Antichrist." because of
[36:38] the gospel. Amen. They are an enemy, but
[36:41] they were only blinded for your sake
[36:43] that you and I as a gentile might
[36:46] receive the glorious gospel of Jesus
[36:48] Christ. Had Israel received their
[36:50] Messiah, you and I would have never had
[36:53] an opportunity. Oh, but according to the
[36:56] Bible, he would hear the prayer of the
[36:58] destitute and he would restore the
[37:00] tabernacle of David. I will call out of
[37:02] them a people for my name's sake. Us
[37:05] Gentiles, idlebearing,
[37:08] mon polytheistic believing. Amen. Had no
[37:12] opportunity. A bunch of heathens.
[37:15] But God rich mercy blinded his own child
[37:19] and opened the door to you and I.
[37:22] Thank you, Jesus. My
[37:25] what a beautiful revelation.
[37:28] What a beautiful revelation. Thank you.
[37:30] You said, "Brother Wayne, is that real
[37:32] real scripture?" Oh, yes. Yes, sir.
[37:36] Hallelujah. They said to them Jews when
[37:38] they were coming back, now I'm going go
[37:39] back to the prophet for a moment. He
[37:41] said, they said to them Jews when they
[37:43] were coming back into their homeland. He
[37:45] said, "Are you coming back here to die?"
[37:48] They said, "No, sir. We're coming back
[37:50] to see our Messiah."
[37:54] Oh, God. Oh, Lord. Yeah. We're coming
[37:58] back to see our Messiah. Hallelujah. Do
[38:02] you know the greatest sign to the
[38:05] gentile world
[38:07] is Israel?
[38:09] Brother said, "You want to know what
[38:10] time it is? Look at Israel."
[38:14] Do you know the Bible said in the book
[38:16] of Hosea that he would gather her again
[38:18] in her lands and then he would revive
[38:20] her and she would live before him again.
[38:24] They're already gathered.
[38:27] But Israel's not saved in progress like
[38:29] the Gentiles. The Bible said they're
[38:31] saved in an in a day. A nation saved in
[38:35] a day. Rome destroyed in an hour. The
[38:37] age of the quick work. Things are
[38:39] getting quicker and quicker and quicker
[38:41] and quicker. Come on, church. Amen. I
[38:44] want you to realize there don't have to
[38:45] be another opening of the book.
[38:48] Throughout the gentile ages, the gospel
[38:51] was distorted and preached every which
[38:53] way through the Catholic doctrines and
[38:54] teachings. And they messed everything
[38:56] up. But God, rich in mercy, sent a
[38:59] seventh angel and unsolved the mystery.
[39:02] And when this book goes back to Israel,
[39:05] this book is already solved out. It
[39:07] don't have to have restoration.
[39:10] You remember the other day we were in
[39:11] Ruth. How many remembers that we were in
[39:13] Ruth the other day and we were talking
[39:15] about how Ruth and Naomi come back. the
[39:17] fig tree portfol.
[39:21] And there the gentile is returning with
[39:23] Ruth and Ruth is in her marriage season.
[39:27] Come on. The redemption of Israel and
[39:29] the marriage of Ruth is happening at the
[39:31] same time under the testimony of Boaz. I
[39:35] have redeemed them. Here comes a prophet
[39:37] with an open book. A testimony. I have
[39:40] redeemed them. Marriage is taking place.
[39:42] Naomi is coming back in her homeland.
[39:45] Amen. And all of a sudden, the scripture
[39:47] tells us that Boaz marries Ruth and they
[39:50] produce a child. They produce a baby. My
[39:54] Amen. I remember years ago, brother
[39:56] Biscll broke the revelation on this and
[39:59] he said, "My" He said, "There Naomi is
[40:01] an elder woman. No children. Her breast
[40:04] is dried up. There's no life in her to
[40:06] feed a child. But when Naomi has her
[40:09] young baby, she takes it to her mother
[40:12] Naomi. And Naomi is refreshed. And the
[40:15] Bible says she is able to nurse the
[40:18] child because it's refreshed her. Oh,
[40:21] church of the living God. This message
[40:24] will revive Israel. It's It's the same
[40:27] child. It's the same message. It's not a
[40:31] different message. Amen. People people
[40:34] get all messed up in Revelations 11
[40:36] because the Bible said when the seventh
[40:37] angel begins to sound. Revelations 11:15
[40:39] it said the seventh angel sound and the
[40:41] Bible said the kingdoms of the world
[40:43] shall become the kingdoms of our God.
[40:44] And they think well there's got to be
[40:46] some other ministry of brother Bannon
[40:47] whatever. Listen. No, no, no. He's
[40:50] already saw out the message. But the
[40:52] seventh angel's message goes into
[40:55] Israel. Amen. And when it does, it
[40:57] brings on the millennium. Yeah,
[41:01] listen. The pillar of fire is bringing
[41:04] on the millennium. He has come and he
[41:07] will not leave this earth until Israel
[41:11] has been restored.
[41:14] He's going to leave this Gentiles. He's
[41:16] going to pull away from them. He's
[41:17] already doing it. You see it happening.
[41:23] Preacher, I tell you, you're coming back
[41:27] to die. No, we're coming back to see our
[41:29] Messiah. Amen.
[41:34] Returning to see our Messiah, brother
[41:36] Ma'am. See, he he takes it right then
[41:39] and he goes right on. He says, "There it
[41:41] is. Them Jews."
[41:43] Amen. Them Jews are returning to their
[41:45] land. Now, Brother Bam's a biblical
[41:48] prophet.
[41:50] And he said, "Now, I'm not a student and
[41:52] have big words like these other men."
[41:55] Yeah. He said, "So I have to use the Old
[41:58] Testament as a shadow and he said, "If
[42:01] we can see the shadow, we know what's
[42:03] coming."
[42:05] So a prophet reaches into the story of
[42:07] Joseph.
[42:08] And he goes back there and he picks up
[42:11] Joseph and said, "Look how Joseph in the
[42:14] beginning, he's going to be the leader,
[42:16] right? He sees the vision and the dream
[42:17] he would be leading his brethren." And
[42:21] he tells them the vision and is a
[42:23] rejected king.
[42:25] Because the brethren don't want to
[42:27] submit to him.
[42:30] So they jump on him, beat him up, throw
[42:33] him in a pit.
[42:35] Sounds like he'll die in the pit.
[42:38] But he ain't going to die in the pit.
[42:40] You know why he can't die in the pit?
[42:43] Because he's Joseph.
[42:50] He's going to save the whole tribe.
[42:54] Amen. All of Israel will be saved by his
[42:57] going in that pit.
[42:59] I love it. I love how scripture says the
[43:01] little things. It says when they're
[43:03] walking away, they're talking about
[43:04] killing him. Remember? And when they're
[43:06] talking about killing, one of the
[43:07] brethren says, "Just don't take his
[43:09] life." That's the same thing they said
[43:11] to Job back there. God said to the
[43:12] devil, "Do anything you want, just don't
[43:14] take his life." Remember that. Don't
[43:16] take his life. So, he's coming out of
[43:18] the pit. No matter what it looks like,
[43:21] the visions, he's coming out of the pit.
[43:22] And when he comes out of the pit, they
[43:24] sell him. They put him at and I I won't
[43:26] preach the whole story of Joseph, but
[43:27] just so you see, it looks real bad at
[43:30] times,
[43:32] but yet look, the whole time he's on his
[43:36] way to something.
[43:38] He's on his way to a throne.
[43:41] When when he finally gets there, I'm I'm
[43:43] not going to preach on Joseph because I
[43:44] ain't got the time. when when Joseph
[43:46] finally gets
[43:48] to the throne and he becomes over the
[43:51] famine that's in the land and he becomes
[43:54] just like a Pharaoh and and and and next
[43:57] to Pharaoh
[43:59] is only when he's different from Pharaoh
[44:02] because he's Joseph and they give him a
[44:06] wife
[44:07] while he's in Egypt. Yeah. So, here is a
[44:11] Jewish leader, the king among them,
[44:15] rejected,
[44:17] and in his rejection, why they think
[44:19] he's dead, they don't even know he's
[44:23] alive, but yet he has taken a gentile
[44:26] wife.
[44:29] Do Do you see? They put the blood on his
[44:31] garment and gave the bloody garment to
[44:34] the father and said he was dead, but he
[44:37] wasn't dead. He was alive. Amen. And he
[44:40] was alive in another country where he
[44:42] had become the Lord of the Gentiles.
[44:46] Our Jesus Christ, who they say is dead.
[44:50] The Jews right now, he's dead. But he's
[44:53] not dead. He's alive. And he's ruling on
[44:58] the throne of God. Amen. And they don't
[45:01] even know it. But our Lord Jesus, who
[45:04] has become the husband to a gentile
[45:07] bride, Yeah.
[45:10] Watch. Amen. Begins to have children and
[45:13] he's fellowshipping down there. But he
[45:16] can't forget he has family.
[45:19] He can't forget Israel. He knows
[45:22] Benjamin is still alive.
[45:25] I don't have time to preach on all these
[45:27] points, but I'll say this. Brother Van
[45:29] said, "When that Benjamin returns,
[45:32] that's that new Jew." Amen. Benjamin, he
[45:34] said them others was down through the
[45:35] ages. But that Benjamin when he comes,
[45:38] he said his hand should be turned to
[45:39] those little ones, Benjamin is on the
[45:42] scene. Amen. Now, now watch when
[45:45] whenever that the when they come down to
[45:47] Joseph to get food, remember he speaks
[45:50] in the Egyptian language and hides
[45:52] himself, he disguises he's he's dealing
[45:54] with them, but he's hidden from them.
[45:58] And and he tells them, "Go get Benjamin
[46:01] and come back." And and when they come
[46:03] back,
[46:04] when Benjamin returns,
[46:08] he takes them in a private place. And I
[46:10] love how scriptures are placed.
[46:13] And the Bible says he was in a room with
[46:16] just them.
[46:19] Brother Brandham picks this up and says,
[46:20] "What's happening is before he reveals
[46:24] himself to his brothers,
[46:26] he puts his wife in the palace." Yeah.
[46:30] right now. Now, if you know the story,
[46:33] folks, now I love stories because if you
[46:36] you get the young people here and you
[46:38] tell them a good story and you our
[46:41] Sunday school teachers, God God bless
[46:43] them for their labors and their work.
[46:45] Uh, Sister Mary, you're a superstar over
[46:47] at the Lawson Home. Eevee tells me
[46:49] that's the nicest person. Sister Mary's
[46:51] the best person in the world.
[46:53] Now,
[46:55] Dee, I'm gonna tell your age. She was
[46:57] one of my Sunday school teachers when I
[46:58] was a kid. Yeah. And I might not
[47:01] remember much more honestly for years
[47:05] from 9 year to 21 than my Sunday school
[47:07] classes. But what I what they did was
[47:10] they taught us stories, Levi. And in
[47:13] those stories are subjects and
[47:16] characters. And they're so simple that
[47:18] even kids can catch them. Yeah. But in
[47:21] the story of Joseph, the wife is not in
[47:25] the palace when he reveals himself to
[47:28] his brethren. So watch, brother Bam so
[47:32] simply puts it, the bride is not on the
[47:36] scene while he reveals himself to his
[47:38] brethren. Now, what does this tell us?
[47:40] Because the scriptures are telling us
[47:42] that Jacob's trouble or the time of the
[47:45] revealing of Jesus to the Jews happens
[47:48] in Daniel's 70th week, which is the
[47:51] tribulation time, right? So, the bride
[47:54] is not in tribulation. Watch a prophet
[47:58] nail it down. The Jew is not Antichrist
[48:01] and the bride is not in tribulation.
[48:03] What's he telling that what's he telling
[48:05] that denominational church? You have no
[48:08] right to place the Jew. You have no
[48:10] right to place the bride. You have no
[48:12] right to place the antichrist. But it'll
[48:15] take a prophet to do it. And when a
[48:17] prophet places you, that is called
[48:20] adoption.
[48:22] Hallelujah. It's an adopted church. It's
[48:25] a position church. We have been put in
[48:28] this word. We know who we are. We know
[48:31] what we're here for. We know where we're
[48:33] going. We know what tomorrow. Because
[48:35] this is not a reformer. It's a prophet.
[48:40] Hallelujah. I am not ashamed to call
[48:43] William Brandham a prophet. Amen. Amen.
[48:47] Hallelujah. I'm not ashamed of the
[48:49] message or the messenger. That's right.
[48:51] Amen. What is it? Amen. There's two
[48:53] things being revealed here. Israel is
[48:55] not the antichrist and the bride does
[48:58] not go into the tribulation. Brother Bam
[49:00] said, "Why would she go in the
[49:02] tribulation? She is totally absolutely
[49:05] sinless before God." How was she
[49:09] sinless? It was by the blood. And if we
[49:12] walk in the light as he is in the light,
[49:15] then we have fellowship with him. What
[49:17] is it? As the word is unfolded, it
[49:20] reveals the mystery of God and places
[49:23] the church under the blood. My that's
[49:25] how that's how that Israel could crucify
[49:29] Christ and still have a place in
[49:31] election because they crucified him
[49:34] before the Holy Ghost came.
[49:37] Is that right? He said, "Do it to me and
[49:40] it shall be forgiven you." But when the
[49:42] Holy Ghost comes and you do it, then it
[49:45] shall never be forgiven you. He was
[49:47] showing you that God had hid them under
[49:50] the ignorance of their attitudes. They
[49:52] had blinded them that you and I might
[49:55] receive them. Amen. That you and I could
[49:57] receive the gospel of Christ. That we
[49:59] might come in under election. What is
[50:02] it? Amen. Watch Brother Bam says it. see
[50:05] Joseph and he shows that gentile wife
[50:07] first seal now he said Joseph left
[50:10] Joseph rose up he said oh my that's it
[50:13] and Joseph rejected by his brother and
[50:15] given a gentile wife
[50:18] Pharaoh give him a gentile wife have
[50:21] gentile half Jew symbols Jacob when he
[50:24] began to bless them he took the blessing
[50:26] from Ephraim
[50:28] and put Manasseh on the other side and
[50:31] crossed his hands
[50:33] and he put the blessing on the younger
[50:36] instead of the elder. And the prophet
[50:39] said, "See there through the cross the
[50:42] blessing come on the Gentiles, bypass
[50:45] the Jews." But God never forgot the
[50:47] Jews. Don't get mad at the Jews. Thank
[50:50] God. Think of the Brother B said he
[50:52] blinded his own people. Thank you,
[50:55] Jesus. That you and I.
[50:58] Thank you, Lord. That you and I might
[51:00] have an opportunity. Thank you, Jesus.
[51:03] Amen. It was a It's not that important.
[51:05] It's so important to God that it would
[51:07] blind his own children that you could
[51:09] see this message. Thank you, Jesus. It's
[51:11] so important to God that he would make
[51:13] his Israel firstborn son wait. Oh,
[51:18] hallelujah. Until this bride was ready
[51:20] for rapture. Thank you, Lord. I was just
[51:23] I was just reading here today, just kind
[51:26] of carried away in here listening to
[51:28] Brother Bam. He's in the second seal and
[51:30] he says it's got to be straightened out.
[51:33] We've all presumed at it. It's been
[51:35] through the church ages, but the hour
[51:37] has come when God speaks.
[51:41] The hour's come when God speaks. Well,
[51:43] if you're listening to the seals and you
[51:45] listen to the first seal, then you
[51:47] listen to the second seal, you'll hear
[51:49] something in that statement. But the
[51:51] hour has come when God speaks. Remember
[51:56] he said, "You that's wondered what those
[51:58] thunders were," he said, "Go back and
[52:00] read in John 12 and see what it says."
[52:03] Jesus said, "My soul is troubled. For
[52:05] the hour has come that the Son of Man
[52:08] must be glorified." And Brother Brham
[52:09] said, "There it was the hour, amen, that
[52:12] he was going to go to the cross." There
[52:13] was an hour. He said, "But what about
[52:16] the hour when the bride is to be
[52:19] glorified? What about the hour?" Amen.
[52:22] What about the hour we're living? when
[52:24] God begins to speak and begins to
[52:27] declare the difference between Israel
[52:29] and the bride, begins to lay it
[52:31] together. Now, I'm going to repeat this
[52:33] for some of you that wasn't here.
[52:34] Brother Bam said, "The thunder is a
[52:36] clapping noise. A thunder is the voice
[52:38] of God."
[52:39] Now, I'm going I want I want to say this
[52:41] real slow because I don't want you to
[52:42] leave this this room. If you're here in
[52:44] this room, I don't want you to ever be
[52:46] confused about this subject again. Yeah.
[52:49] I'd like this to be the end of confusion
[52:53] on this point.
[52:56] The voice is a thunder.
[53:01] Brother Bam said, "John knew
[53:04] it was the voice of God."
[53:08] Amen. Brother Bam says it like this, and
[53:10] this is so powerful. We found what the
[53:13] thunder means. We know it.
[53:17] The thunder was the voice of God when
[53:20] the seal opened.
[53:23] When the seal opened, see it was a
[53:25] thunder because it was a white horse, a
[53:28] bow, no arrows. It was a symbol.
[53:32] So it was a thunder. Though God spoke,
[53:34] it was a thunder. It was hid. But when a
[53:37] prophet speaks, it's not a thunder. It's
[53:40] a voice. It's not a confusion. It's a
[53:44] reality. It's not him saying it could be
[53:48] maybe, perhaps. So, it could be this.
[53:51] No, it's him saying this is that. Amen.
[53:55] The white horse is that, the bow is
[53:59] that, the seal is that because this is
[54:01] not the hour of confusion. It is the
[54:04] hour of revelation.
[54:06] Come on, church. You know, Brother Bam
[54:08] said every one of these seals, it had a
[54:11] beast said, "Come and see." And brother
[54:12] Bam said those beasts were anointings.
[54:15] And you could only operate under the
[54:17] anointing of your age. He said that
[54:19] first one that come was a lion. He said
[54:21] then there come a calf and then there
[54:23] come the man. He said but the last one
[54:25] is an eagle. Watch. And you don't know
[54:28] what the others are until the eagle
[54:31] comes along. And the eagle comes just
[54:34] before tribulation
[54:37] because he's going to reveal the
[54:40] antichrist so the bride can escape the
[54:43] tribulation. This message has come to
[54:46] give you an escape from denomination,
[54:48] the antichrist, from tribulation, from
[54:51] the lust of this world. The message is
[54:53] your escape.
[54:56] And I saw a door opened up into the
[54:58] heavens that said, "Come unto me." Amen.
[55:01] What is it? It's God's word opening,
[55:03] telling you, "Come out of the tradition.
[55:06] Come out of the idea. Come out of the
[55:08] reformation. Come into the divine
[55:11] revelation of the word of God." That'll
[55:14] carry you on eagle's wings into the
[55:16] presence of God where the devil lost and
[55:19] the power of God is real. Election is
[55:22] true. Realities are strong. This is not
[55:25] a reformation. This is the revelation of
[55:28] the word of God. I'm not guessing I'm
[55:30] bride. I know by the word I'm bride.
[55:36] Glory, brother Mike. Throughout the ages
[55:39] they guessed. Maybe I hope so. Think so.
[55:43] Maybe so. But this message has revealed
[55:46] the mystery. Brother man said called
[55:48] your name.
[55:51] Hallelujah.
[55:52] Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Glory. This
[55:56] word.
[55:58] He is not the author of confusion.
[56:02] It's clarity
[56:04] and revelation. Yes. Not laying at night
[56:07] pulling your hair trying to decide
[56:09] what's right. It's relaxing and saying,
[56:12] "God, this prophet told me the truth."
[56:17] Come on, church. The truth will make you
[56:21] free. Hallelujah. Free to be raptured.
[56:25] Free to be delivered. Free to move out
[56:27] into the presence of God. It's the truth
[56:29] that does it. It sure is.
[56:33] Listen, brother said it. He said, "Look
[56:35] now." He said if you are hearing these
[56:39] things
[56:40] he said listen I want you to know Satan
[56:44] marks his people by unbelief
[56:50] and seals he teaches this he said he
[56:52] marks them by unbelief. Now what does
[56:54] that mean? He says, "When they hear the
[56:57] truth of it
[57:00] and they had more pleasure in
[57:03] unrighteousness, wow, than in the truth,
[57:08] he said, just like the Old Testament, he
[57:10] said when the Jubilee sounded,
[57:14] it was a call to return to freedom."
[57:17] Yes. He said, "But if they had fell in
[57:20] love with their masters, if they loved
[57:22] what they were in, he said they had a
[57:25] choice." And remember, they would all
[57:27] their ear and they would put an earring
[57:30] at them to mark them. They've heard it
[57:32] and turned it down. And the prophet of
[57:35] God said that's what Satan will do when
[57:37] unbelief starts over you. He said he'll
[57:39] nail you to the wall and deafen your ear
[57:43] that you will never be able to hear it
[57:47] that way again.
[57:49] When it sounds in your heart, that's the
[57:51] truth. It don't matter if you can
[57:54] explain it. It don't matter that you can
[57:56] tie all of it together. You listen. Some
[57:59] people said to me, "Brother Wayne, I
[58:00] can't put it all together like you can."
[58:02] Well, you know, maybe God called me for
[58:04] this part. Yes, that's right. But he
[58:06] called you for that part and your part
[58:09] is the believing part. It's saying God,
[58:12] that's the truth part. Come on, folks.
[58:14] You can't tell me Hattie Wright knew
[58:16] everything about everything that was
[58:18] going on in Brother Bam's ministry. But
[58:20] she knew it was the truth. And when she
[58:22] said that's nothing but the truth,
[58:23] Brother Bam, she opened up another
[58:25] dimension. And we might not understand
[58:28] everything we hear or everything we
[58:30] read, but we know it's the truth. It's
[58:33] the truth by the grace of God. And the
[58:36] prophet of God said God seals his
[58:38] believers.
[58:40] He seals them with a Holy Ghost, with a
[58:42] Holy Ghost and power. My, when I think
[58:45] about it tonight, it's a truth that God
[58:48] has brought us into. Won't you stand to
[58:50] your feet with us tonight? The truth,
[58:52] that's what sets us free. Amen.
[58:56] The truth. Amen. Right. That's what
[59:00] gives us liberation.
[59:02] Amen.
[59:04] You can live your whole life
[59:07] thinking the Jews is the Antichrist,
[59:12] but five minutes under a prophet and
[59:15] it'll clear up. Hallelujah.
[59:17] Yes.
[59:20] You know why?
[59:22] Because God sent him to clear it up.
[59:24] Yes. Amen. That's right. And he said
[59:26] it's simple.
[59:29] But Ray, so guys like us could get it.
[59:32] Yeah. Simple. He just said it simple.
[59:36] The Jews, not the Antichrist.
[59:38] The Antichrist comes out of Rome, not
[59:40] Palestine.
[59:42] The Antichrist is religious. It's not
[59:45] communist.
[59:49] And it begins its first ride on an
[59:52] anti-word horse.
[59:55] Lying. That's right. False teaching.
[59:59] That's how it slips in.
[1:00:02] But the truth,
[1:00:04] the truth will unveil it. Yeah. It'll
[1:00:07] unseal it and let you see it. Yes, sir.
[1:00:10] Thank you, Jesus. The truth. Truth will
[1:00:11] give you deliverance. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:00:15] Truth. The truth will let you know who
[1:00:18] you are.
[1:00:20] The real The real truth.
[1:00:23] And see, Sister Esther, don't matter how
[1:00:25] you get up in the morning, whether you
[1:00:26] feel bad or good, you you're still
[1:00:28] Esther, right? Yeah.
[1:00:31] But the more sure that you are,
[1:00:35] the less confusion you have. Yeah. But
[1:00:38] you ever start wondering if your name's
[1:00:39] Esther and who's your dad and is your
[1:00:41] mom and is this my family and this? Then
[1:00:43] confusion starts. But but the more
[1:00:46] you're sure who you are, who your
[1:00:49] parents are, what your foundations are,
[1:00:53] the more clear clarity you have on
[1:00:55] yourself as an individual. Will you let
[1:00:57] that start happening to you in the
[1:00:59] spiritual
[1:01:02] Because see, Satan tries to take your
[1:01:04] identity on this perhaps. Oh, oh, well,
[1:01:07] you had that failure. You said that. You
[1:01:09] You thought that, you felt that. Yeah,
[1:01:12] but we're talking about identity.
[1:01:19] See, it's different, right? Yeah. We're
[1:01:23] talking about identity. Who are you?
[1:01:28] But if you carry the name of a
[1:01:30] Christian,
[1:01:31] then you ought to act like a Christian.
[1:01:33] That's right.
[1:01:36] Truth. Amen.
[1:01:39] To act like a Christian. See, it's the
[1:01:41] truth.
[1:01:43] It's the truth that'll set you free.
[1:01:45] See, Revelations
[1:01:47] contained
[1:01:49] under the seals.
[1:01:51] Powerful stuff under there.
[1:01:55] little simple things but under clarity.
[1:02:01] See, this is the hour, right? This is
[1:02:04] the hour. I had it laying here. I don't
[1:02:06] want to read it all, but I I have it
[1:02:08] laying here. This is the hour.
[1:02:11] And brother Bam said, "See, when he
[1:02:14] separates this tribulation,
[1:02:16] this foolish virgin, this Jew, this
[1:02:19] bride," he said, "See,
[1:02:23] remember, he went over, he went over
[1:02:25] there and he had him a plane ticket and
[1:02:28] he said, "I'm going to go I'm going to
[1:02:29] go preach to the Jews." He said,
[1:02:30] "They'll receive the sign of Messiah."
[1:02:33] And he said, "The Lord called me over
[1:02:35] behind the hanger and said, "The time is
[1:02:37] not yet." Yeah.
[1:02:41] The time is not yet. The ministry,
[1:02:45] he didn't say what you got won't do it.
[1:02:50] He just said it's not time yet.
[1:02:55] And when brother Bram said that, he
[1:02:56] said, but see, he comes back and
[1:02:58] preaches the seals to the bride. And
[1:03:01] then he says, see, this is the great
[1:03:03] hour. Yes, sir. Yeah. to tell the bride
[1:03:06] how to prepare for translation faith.
[1:03:11] See, I look folks, I thank God for a
[1:03:17] prophet,
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:20] sir. Look, look, I'm and and I'm I'm a
[1:03:23] Boy Scout, so I'm I'm gonna pre predate
[1:03:25] this with this. I'm a Boy Scout. I I was
[1:03:28] one badge from Life Scout, which is next
[1:03:30] to Eagle. So, I was way up in the Boy
[1:03:33] Scouts. And you know what? Scouts are
[1:03:34] always prepared.
[1:03:39] I got a generator. You know, I got
[1:03:40] gener.
[1:03:44] So, I'm not being I'm not being
[1:03:46] like like you got a family, you know. I
[1:03:48] got a freezer. We can we could go a week
[1:03:50] without going to the grocery store,
[1:03:51] maybe too.
[1:03:56] But I'm not preparing for tribulation.
[1:04:00] Come on now. Amen. I'm not preparing to
[1:04:03] stay here.
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:07] Because this message teaches you
[1:04:09] translation faith.
[1:04:12] It's teaching you how to let go of the
[1:04:14] world. It's teaching you how to release
[1:04:17] yourself out of this world in this
[1:04:19] leadya and rise up in his favor.
[1:04:22] Hallelujah. Oh, I thank God for it
[1:04:24] tonight. Thank you, Jesus. I wonder if
[1:04:26] we could just raise our hands, say,
[1:04:27] "Thank you, Lord, for truth.
[1:04:30] Thank you for truth, Lord. Thank you,
[1:04:32] Jesus. Thank you for a message, Lord.
