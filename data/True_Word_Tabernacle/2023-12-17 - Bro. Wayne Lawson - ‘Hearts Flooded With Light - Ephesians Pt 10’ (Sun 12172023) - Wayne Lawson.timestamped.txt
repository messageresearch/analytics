[6:08] high God amen amen that that most high
[6:12] God comes from over in the Book of
[6:14] Genesis when God met Abraham and he said
[6:17] to him the most the most high God it was
[6:20] um it was actually one of the titles of
[6:22] Jehovah Elon and and meaning that he is
[6:26] the most high that there is no one above
[6:28] him he is the most high amen it's
[6:31] certainly uh good to have all of our
[6:33] visitors here this morning each one of
[6:35] you and amen and uh we look for a
[6:38] special day in the Lord today and amen
[6:41] uh we're going to be speaking this
[6:42] morning and uh for the book of Ephesians
[6:44] but just before we go to prayer uh
[6:47] through the scripture we'd like to go to
[6:49] prayer if we could just maybe bow our
[6:50] hearts and maybe just might reach over
[6:53] and take somebody by the hand or lay
[6:55] your hand on them and I just want to
[6:58] take just a moment this morning morning
[7:00] just just in prayer there's some things
[7:03] on our heart here but just just in
[7:06] studying last night and and sitting over
[7:08] and and some of the things we were
[7:10] reading here and I thought wouldn't it
[7:11] be something Lord if there could just be
[7:15] a new beginning today and some of the
[7:17] situations and some of the hearts and
[7:19] lives and maybe some come this morning
[7:23] and you just like to redo some things in
[7:25] your life and some new Direction and and
[7:29] I thought oh God we we serve a god
[7:33] that'll let us empty out so we can fill
[7:35] up again so I just wonder this morning
[7:38] as we bow our hearts if you just take a
[7:40] moment pray for the brother beside you
[7:42] or the sister beside you let's just
[7:44] dedicate this to him say Lord speak to
[7:46] our hearts this morning
[7:49] [Music]
[7:50] Father Lord you know the need of your
[7:55] people and father I'm aware that it's
[7:58] far beyond our ability
[8:00] Lord some of these things are so far Out
[8:03] Of Reach for a human being but Lord
[8:06] You're the god of
[8:08] Abraham and there is no condition
[8:10] there's no hindrance to you nor your
[8:13] word oh God and father I pray this

[8:38] take a moment before we begin this
[8:40] meeting just a rededication of hearts
[8:42] and lives and asking you oh god father
[8:46] we we don't begin many services this way
[8:48] but this morning we just feel an
[8:50] inspiration Lord that we just begin with
[8:53] a lord we love you we want to serve you
[8:57] with our hearts oh God and we we ask you
[8:59] this morning that there would come such
[9:01] an anointing in the room Lord that you
[9:03] would give us grace and mercy and father
[9:06] that you would speak to our very needs
[9:09] and Lord that you would set aside the
[9:11] enemy that would so try Lord to beset
[9:15] your children but we ask you now for
[9:17] every individual life as one hand is
[9:19] laid on the other of your children Lord
[9:22] joining together Lord coming against the
[9:25] enemy our enemy and your enemy Lord you
[9:28] said you would be adversary to our
[9:30] adversary and we pray this morning that
[9:33] every Spirit unlike you Lord may they be
[9:35] bound by the authority of the almighty
[9:38] God that was written in a contract that
[9:41] whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be
[9:43] bound in heaven and as a body this
[9:46] morning we bind every Spirit of
[9:48] confusion we bind every Spirit of
[9:51] unbelief we bind the spirit of sickness
[9:54] Lord and we ask you now in the name of
[9:57] Jesus may your mercy come into this
[9:59] Sanctuary Lord and give us Liberty upon
[10:02] your word now we ask it in Jesus
[10:06] name amen and amen God bless you this
[10:10] morning amen if you have your Bibles we'
[10:14] just like to go over into the word now
[10:16] into the book of
[10:17] Ephesians amen I'm I'm just uh just
[10:21] caught up in some of these things and
[10:22] I've just not been able to pull out of
[10:24] them so amen Ephesians chapter 1 uh and
[10:28] actually we're get into some of my
[10:29] favorite part of the book of Ephesians
[10:32] uh this next few verses is just uh I I
[10:35] there's no way that we can teach it
[10:36] verse by verse but I want to preach the
[10:38] subject anyhow um I want to read here uh
[10:42] where we were at uh Thursday night and
[10:45] then continue the reading and you'll see
[10:46] the continuity it's beautiful in whom uh
[10:50] Ephesians 1:13 in whom you also trusted
[10:54] after that you heard the word of Truth
[10:56] The Gospel of your salvation in whom
[10:58] also that after you believed you were
[11:01] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[11:04] now what's the seal it's the Holy
[11:07] Ghost now which is the earnest can I say
[11:11] it like this which is also the
[11:13] earnest of our
[11:16] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[11:18] purchased possession brother Bram said
[11:20] that's what we get till we get to body
[11:21] change or the fullness of the adoption
[11:24] amen now wherefore I also after I heard
[11:29] word of your faith in the Lord Jesus and
[11:31] the love unto all the saints cease not
[11:35] to give thanks for you mentioning you in
[11:39] my
[11:40] prayers now here's the prayer of apostle
[11:44] Paul that the god of our Lord Jesus
[11:48] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[11:52] you the spirit of wisdom and the
[11:55] Revelation in the knowledge of him yeah
[11:59] now this is an Apostles prayer over an
[12:01] Ephesian church amen that God would give
[12:05] wisdom Revelation knowledge and that
[12:09] what the next verse that the eyes of
[12:12] your understanding being
[12:16] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[12:19] hope of his calling and what is the
[12:22] riches of the glory of the inheritance
[12:23] of the Saints so in verse 17 he's
[12:26] praying that you get wisdom and
[12:27] knowledge of God and in verse 18 he's
[12:30] praying that your eyes will catch your
[12:33] part that's in the calling of God and
[12:37] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[12:40] power to us word who believe according
[12:41] to the working of his mighty power amen
[12:45] God bless the word as you could be
[12:46] seated this
[12:48] morning I want to read as well from the
[12:50] book of Ephesians here uh this is an
[12:53] amplified version it's um uh I I just
[12:56] thought it was so powerful um if it's
[12:59] just something that kind of helps along
[13:01] uh I love how Paul says this in the King
[13:04] James the Amplified version says it just
[13:07] a little different and I want to read it
[13:08] to you it's beautiful uh I do not cease
[13:10] to give thanks for you making mention of
[13:14] you in my
[13:15] prayers for I always
[13:18] pray that the god of the Lord Jesus
[13:21] Christ the father of Glory that he may
[13:24] Grant you a spirit of wisdom and
[13:27] revelation of in sight into the
[13:30] Mysteries and secrets and into the deep
[13:33] and intimate knowledge of him by having
[13:37] the eyes of your heart flooded with
[13:41] light well I like that amen amen by
[13:44] having your heart the eyes of your heart
[13:49] flooded with light so that you can know
[13:52] and understand to which he has called
[13:55] you and how rich is his glorious
[13:58] inheritance in the Saint his set apart
[14:00] ones and you can know and understand
[14:03] what is the immeasurable and unlimited
[14:05] and surpassing greatness of his power in
[14:08] us who believed now I I love that part
[14:12] and I want to take that if I can amen
[14:15] amen having Hearts flooded with light
[14:17] and I want to talk to us this morning a
[14:19] little bit about our hearts amen flooded
[14:22] with light amen I I just love the idea
[14:25] that God would flood his church with
[14:28] light that he would flood our hearts and
[14:31] he would fill it with light amen uh when
[14:33] I go back into the scriptures I find uh
[14:36] this is a a a great subject and and it
[14:39] covers a vast amount of the message of
[14:42] the hour of course but in this little
[14:44] area I want to talk to you a few minutes
[14:46] in this but I want to go back to 70th
[14:49] week of Daniel just for a moment and
[14:51] brother R going say something here he
[14:53] said that in the last days God's going
[14:55] to reveal these secrets to the church he
[14:58] hasn't done it before and the reason he
[15:00] hasn't done it is to keep the church
[15:03] watching and praying all the time not
[15:06] knowing when he's coming but remember in
[15:09] Daniel 12 he said that the wise shall
[15:12] understand in the last day see it's
[15:15] going to be given the spirit of wisdom
[15:17] comes into the church to make known to
[15:20] the church by the revelation of the Holy
[15:22] Ghost bringing the church in and
[15:25] revealing what day they were living in
[15:27] the same is Gabriel came to Daniel the
[15:31] Holy Spirit comes to the church in the
[15:34] last day to reveal these great deep
[15:37] secret things amen now here's what Paul
[15:40] is saying he's saying I'm praying that
[15:43] the Lord will grant unto you this
[15:45] knowledge and wisdom and it'll come to
[15:47] you now I love that Paul's prayers are
[15:50] in line with scriptural promises do you
[15:53] want you want to see your prayers really
[15:55] excel in your life find the promises
[15:58] that God has made and then pray those
[16:00] promises become effective remember uh
[16:03] the other week we were teaching on the
[16:04] bride's Revival and brother R said they
[16:06] not recognized The Awakening of the
[16:08] Bride though praying and fasting they've
[16:10] not recognized The Awakening of the
[16:12] bride and he says see but if they would
[16:14] plead the promise it would become
[16:17] effective to them in other words if you
[16:19] got the promise and you're praying the
[16:21] promise the promise will become
[16:22] effective I I let me just say it like
[16:24] this you've heard brother brandom say
[16:25] pray for Revelation more than anything
[16:28] else amen now he wouldn't tell you that
[16:31] if there wasn't something in there amen
[16:34] that could be brought forth let me just
[16:35] go into the scripture with job when job
[16:38] was standing there and the Lord said
[16:39] unto him where was thou before the
[16:41] foundations of the world now I don't
[16:44] know that job had ever even thought that
[16:46] that was available to know amen amen uh
[16:49] you who would ever sat around without
[16:51] God inspiring that question and think
[16:54] that he could even know where he was
[16:56] before the world began but when God
[16:58] asked ask him that question now amen he
[17:00] says wait a minute this is available so
[17:03] when you go to the end of job in the
[17:04] 42nd chapter you will see job beginning
[17:07] to say unto the Lord declare thou unto
[17:10] me Lord amen and he begins to then uh uh
[17:13] demand of the Lord basically that he
[17:15] would receive the answers that God has
[17:18] asked him so sometimes amen we must
[17:20] realize that our prayers amen if you
[17:23] start praying in the direction that God
[17:25] has given the promise then your prayers
[17:28] can become manifest and here we find
[17:30] that there has been given the spirit and
[17:33] wisdom and Revelation to come in the end
[17:35] time who the Church of the Living God
[17:38] now the Bible declares this in the Book
[17:40] of Daniel Amen that the wise will know
[17:43] their God in Daniel 1 brother brandom's
[17:46] telling us that Gabriel came to Daniel
[17:48] and revealed these things and so will
[17:50] the holy spirit in the last days in
[17:52] Daniel 1 it says in the first year of
[17:54] Darius the son of ayus the seed of of of
[17:57] the mes which which was made uh King
[17:59] over the realm of the Chans in the first
[18:02] year of this Reign Daniel I understood
[18:05] by the book the number of years whereof
[18:08] the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
[18:10] the prophet that he would accomplish 70
[18:12] years in the desolations of Jerusalem
[18:15] now here's the beauty is is Daniel was
[18:18] actually learning by the books amen he
[18:21] had tooken and he knew the time was
[18:24] coming but he had understood by the
[18:26] books the season that he was living
[18:29] uh I I I think it's powerful in gabel's
[18:31] instructions brother Ram says he knows
[18:33] my heart and he's listening to me but I
[18:36] I wanted that I might Enlighten the
[18:38] people therefore I believe he's going to
[18:41] give it to me and Gable's instructions
[18:44] brother Braham said how do you expect
[18:46] people which are poor people uh brother
[18:48] Bram was going to be preaching on some
[18:49] deep things you know and his wife is
[18:51] talking to him and she says brother bam
[18:54] how do you expect these people I just
[18:56] hear the wife you know how do you expect
[18:58] these poor people and many of them
[19:00] uneducated like we are to understand
[19:02] these things and he said God will give
[19:05] the answer no matter how complicated it
[19:08] is God can break it down and make it
[19:11] simple for for we a portion of those
[19:14] people who are longing and praying for
[19:17] that day that hour that our eyes are set
[19:20] towards heaven and we're watching for
[19:21] this coming and I'm sure that he will
[19:24] show it to us and see here is a man
[19:28] who's saying that that these things are
[19:30] not above your understanding amen the
[19:33] the great mysteries of God in the end
[19:35] time are not Out Of Reach to the church
[19:38] now they were at one time but the spirit
[19:41] of wisdom and Revelation has been given
[19:44] in the end times so the church would
[19:46] come to the knowledge of him now brother
[19:49] bandam says see that was the thing that
[19:51] Daniel did he understood by the books
[19:53] now when we say this he understood by
[19:55] books Daniel was actually reading
[19:57] Jeremiah
[19:58] he was reading the former Prophet that
[20:01] had been in front of them and had
[20:02] prophesied that they would be down in in
[20:05] Babylon for 70 years and as he read
[20:07] these prophecies amen he began to
[20:11] understand them for his season or his
[20:13] day amen Daniel begin to understand by
[20:16] the reading of the books now brother
[20:17] randam said he was reading Jeremiah the
[20:19] 25th chapter amen and in the book of
[20:22] Jeremiah amen it said the word of the
[20:25] Lord was scattered across the world and
[20:27] it had the words of God was like wine to
[20:31] the people they had power they had
[20:33] reality and Jeremiah took the word of
[20:35] the Lord and it was as a wine and the
[20:38] power of that wine it was intoxicating
[20:41] the words that Jeremiah had said can you
[20:43] imagine Daniel drinking the words of
[20:45] Jeremiah 70 years in Babylon 70 years in
[20:50] captivity and he starts drinking in the
[20:53] revelations of Jeremiah my how he's how
[20:56] he must have become intoxicated with
[20:58] liberty and with freedom and the
[21:00] knowledge that this this Babylonian
[21:02] kingdom was coming to an end and there
[21:05] would be a great uh Exile of the Church
[21:07] of the Living God back to original
[21:09] worship amen it was intoxicating by
[21:12] these things now brother brandom tells
[21:13] us this again in Gabriel's instructions
[21:16] it see if there ever was a time that we
[21:18] ought to be setting ourselves in order
[21:20] to pray amen for his true servants we
[21:23] see by the letters of the Apostles and
[21:26] by the warning of the holy spirit that
[21:29] we are in the last
[21:31] day now here brother brandom says I
[21:35] understand here he is as Daniel he's
[21:37] just placed himself as a Daniel in the
[21:39] end time reading the letters of the
[21:42] Apostles and he said I understand that
[21:44] there will come scoffers in the last
[21:46] days now now you you here's the beauty
[21:50] is uh understanding is
[21:53] power understanding is power when you
[21:56] really understand and it brings power
[21:59] into your life it's just like maybe
[22:01] somebody comes against the message of
[22:03] the hour so you would start questioning
[22:05] the message because of someone scoffing
[22:08] the message but see if you understand
[22:10] that somebody has got to scoff this
[22:13] message that the Bible said scoffers
[22:16] shall come in the last days so don't let
[22:19] someone scoffing the message shake you
[22:21] up amen because they're supposed to be
[22:24] there amen somebody said something to
[22:26] brother brandom about people was
[22:28] thinking he was deity you know and and
[22:30] brother bam says amen he says well
[22:32] they're not as far off as you think amen
[22:34] but he he told one man he said well I
[22:36] would question my Ministry if they
[22:38] wasn't there see because they was there
[22:41] with Jesus amen amen every time the
[22:44] ministry of Christ has been on the earth
[22:46] you've had all these same spirits and
[22:48] when you start understanding that there
[22:51] has to be the spirits in their places
[22:53] and you understand oh you're just
[22:55] fulfilling that position but see God
[22:58] didn't give us that position he gave us
[23:01] as a position of a Believer amen and you
[23:04] see there's got to understand there
[23:06] shall come scoffers in the last days now
[23:09] there also will come Nation against
[23:11] nation and brother Bram said I
[23:13] understand there'll be tidal waves I
[23:16] understand there'll be fearful sights in
[23:18] the skies flying saucers there will have
[23:21] mysterious lights men's Hearts will fail
[23:24] for fear there'll be perplexities of
[23:26] times and distress and he said and I've
[23:28] read of the organizations and
[23:30] denominations and confederations I
[23:33] understand that women will Bob off their
[23:34] hair in the last day amen boy that was
[23:37] straight up wasn't it he said I
[23:39] understand they'll wear short clothes
[23:40] and walk in high heeled shoes tinkling
[23:42] as they go I understand the morale will
[23:45] be very low in the last day I understand
[23:47] the preachers will be false shepherds in
[23:49] the last day they'll compromise not to
[23:52] feed the people the word of God but go
[23:54] after Creeds and things instead I
[23:57] understand there'll be a voice coming
[23:58] the last days but it'll be crying out of
[24:01] the Wilderness calling the people back
[24:03] to the original message back to the
[24:06] things of God I understand by the books
[24:09] these things are to take place I
[24:12] understand that there will come a famine
[24:14] and the churches will get so organized
[24:16] and everything in the last days that
[24:18] there will come a famine not for the
[24:20] bread and water but for the hearing of
[24:22] the word of God Amen I tell you brother
[24:25] man said if there ever was a nation it
[24:27] was America they had plenty to eat he
[24:29] said but the famine was for the hearing
[24:31] of the true word of God and it's not
[24:33] that there's not preaching right amen
[24:35] there's more Ministry today there's more
[24:37] preaching there's more churches there's
[24:39] more religion than there's ever been but
[24:41] why is there a famine because there's a
[24:44] spirit of confusion that has come in the
[24:46] last days and confuse the people about
[24:50] what to believe about the word they can
[24:52] see the prophet's message but people say
[24:54] well this this and it means this and it
[24:56] means that so people don't know what to
[24:59] believe that's why people are hungry
[25:01] today if they could just believe the
[25:04] prophet they would have a barrel full of
[25:07] meal that would never run dry there is a
[25:10] there is life in the message of the hour
[25:13] but see Satan has brought a famine in
[25:16] the land but the Bible said it would
[25:18] come because of the spirit of confusion
[25:21] now look at this amen the spirit of
[25:23] confusion will knock people away from
[25:25] reality it'll knock it away from it in
[25:27] and people will not be able to feed upon
[25:29] it amen because they won't know what to
[25:32] believe do you see why Paul was saying
[25:35] I'm praying that the people will have
[25:37] the spirit of wisdom and of knowledge in
[25:39] the last day because there will be
[25:41] another group of people that will be
[25:43] confused and though they have the whole
[25:45] word of God they will set hungry because
[25:48] they will not eat the true word of God
[25:51] believing that it's something else you
[25:54] see I understand there'll come famines
[25:56] and it'll be for the the true word of
[25:58] God and people will go from the East to
[26:00] the West Amen to hear the true word of
[26:02] God but churches will be so organized
[26:04] that they'll tighten up and they'll fail
[26:07] to hear it I understand in the last day
[26:10] that there'll be a branch rise out of
[26:12] David now look at the beauty this he
[26:14] said the churches are going to get
[26:15] organized he said but there'll come a
[26:17] branch out of David look what he says he
[26:19] said I understand that he'll send Elijah
[26:22] I don't know that I've ever tied them
[26:23] scriptures together but there'll come a
[26:25] branch amen out of David behold I send
[26:28] unto you Elijah amen what is it the
[26:31] heart of the children will be turned
[26:33] back to the father's the original amen
[26:36] now if you're going to if you're going
[26:37] to Open the Eyes of the people there has
[26:40] to be a dealing with a heart amen the
[26:43] message of the hour is not an
[26:45] intellectual message it is a heart
[26:47] turning message amen and your eyes are
[26:50] directly connected to your heart in 2
[26:53] Corinthians the 3D chapter Paul said
[26:55] though they still read the words of
[26:57] Moses which speaks of Jesus plainly we
[27:00] all know that but when they read it they
[27:02] read it with a veil over their hearts we
[27:05] know that they they've crucified their
[27:07] very Messiah having the word of God and
[27:10] crucified their Messiah because they had
[27:13] a lack of knowledge of who they were
[27:16] dealing with the Bible said had they had
[27:18] known they would not have crucified him
[27:21] but they did not know because they were
[27:22] blinded but they were blinded by
[27:25] prophecy are you with me they were
[27:27] blinded by prophecy Isaiah said having
[27:29] eyes they wouldn't see and having ears
[27:31] they wouldn't hear but blessed are your
[27:34] eyes for they see and blessed are your
[27:37] ears for they hear amen God give us the
[27:40] spirit of wisdom and Revelation and
[27:42] knowledge of what God is doing in our
[27:46] generation I understand that there would
[27:49] come amen a prophet in the last days
[27:52] according to Malachi chapter 4 5 and 6
[27:55] brother Ram says see here it is he said
[27:57] see amen he hasn't done this before and
[28:01] the reason he hasn't see because it was
[28:04] put off for another day but in the last
[28:06] days the spirit of wisdom comes into the
[28:10] church to make known the church the
[28:13] revelation of the word of God do you
[28:15] know there's nothing of Greater
[28:16] prevailing power than
[28:18] Revelation the Bible said Upon This Rock
[28:22] I will build my church and the Gates of
[28:25] Hell will not Prevail against it
[28:27] Revelation is the most prevailing thing
[28:29] that you can get a hold of when you get
[28:32] Revelation it surpasses amen your
[28:34] emotional state it surpasses the
[28:37] conditions of anything that you're
[28:39] living in Revelation is the supreme
[28:42] power over everything else that's in
[28:45] this life Revelation amen is that which
[28:48] gives Mercy I think it's beautiful when
[28:50] you're reading second Peter and Peter is
[28:52] drawing out what a perfect man is amen
[28:55] it it's beautiful cuz he starts that
[28:57] that with faith and he starts building
[28:59] the church up under faith and then he
[29:01] comes to the third part and he says but
[29:03] we got to add under the church knowledge
[29:06] and I thought it was mighty because amen
[29:09] you know it seeming like knowledge is
[29:12] something uh that that can I just say it
[29:14] this way it's something the devil got a
[29:17] hold of and he so Twisted it that
[29:19] sometimes Holy Ghost filled people hear
[29:21] the word knowledge and go to running
[29:23] backwards because they think you're
[29:24] trying to educate them but brother bam
[29:26] says but remember that tape he preaches
[29:29] lean not to thine own understanding
[29:32] right he says now Proverbs that Solomon
[29:35] was the wisest man of the world was not
[29:37] trying to say to his son to be
[29:38] illiterate he was just saying when your
[29:41] knowledge comes in in conflict with the
[29:42] knowledge of God let your knowledge go
[29:46] amen and believe the things of God Amen
[29:49] so watch we not to our own understanding
[29:51] didn't mean we shouldn't have an
[29:53] understanding but the Bible said with
[29:54] all thy getting get understanding and if
[29:57] if the people perish they perish because
[29:59] of a lack of knowledge amen we need the
[30:02] knowledge of God in us to be a perfect
[30:05] man and that knowledge that I'm talking
[30:07] about it's when Isaiah cries out in
[30:09] Isaiah 28 and said Whom Shall we teach
[30:12] knowledge brother mam said give
[30:14] Revelation amen and then ties it
[30:17] directly with the rest that it causes
[30:19] the weary to rest when we talk about
[30:21] knowledge we're talking about God's
[30:23] knowledge there is a worldly knowledge
[30:25] and it's a foolishness to God and
[30:27] there's a knowledge but there's a
[30:29] knowledge to judge right from wrong
[30:31] there is a knowledge amen of virtue and
[30:34] faith that you judge whether the word is
[30:36] right or wrong see then brother Ram said
[30:39] you can lay aside all Creeds and all
[30:41] your unbelief and you claim you have
[30:44] done see then you have knowledge to
[30:46] believe that God cannot lie let every
[30:48] man's word leave see the kind of
[30:50] knowledge we need it is a supreme
[30:53] knowledge knowing that God cannot lie
[30:56] whatever else you know in your life know
[30:59] this God cannot
[31:02] lie amen that's the knowledge that the
[31:04] church really needs this morning is that
[31:07] God cannot lie amen I think of brother
[31:09] brandom he said see Abraham had
[31:11] knowledge he said God is able to perform
[31:14] that which he has promised that's the
[31:16] kind of knowledge we need that can rise
[31:18] up and say God is able e stones to rise
[31:21] children unto Abraham if you really know
[31:23] God if you really have a knowledge of
[31:25] God you know God can't lie but God can
[31:28] do everything else he can't fail but he
[31:30] can do everything else because he's God
[31:33] now this knowledge amen that God is does
[31:36] not contradict the knowledge amen uh of
[31:40] his word let me just say this it's a
[31:42] heaven born knowledge it's a spiritual
[31:44] knowledge it's a knowledge of his word
[31:46] brother B says which is not added but
[31:48] but which is grown out of the heart like
[31:51] a peacock feather's grown out of a
[31:53] peacock or a dove feather's grown out of
[31:54] a dove feather you can't add it to you
[31:58] right you you can't add it to you like
[32:00] you can't take it and stick it in you
[32:02] amen I I always loved how brother Bram
[32:04] said it he said you can't take Dove
[32:06] feathers and stick them in a black bird
[32:08] and have a dove right cuz when pressure
[32:11] comes the feather just falls out but you
[32:13] can't take a dove feather and stick it
[32:15] at a dove either a dove has to grow its
[32:18] feathers and the Church of the Living
[32:20] God has to grow Knowledge from the seed
[32:23] that God put in their heart because our
[32:26] God is the god of knowledge Our God
[32:29] knows everything about everything amen
[32:32] it was amazing in the days of Daniel
[32:34] when the king asked and he and he needed
[32:36] some information and the wise men didn't
[32:39] know it and and the susers didn't know
[32:41] it amen but God Amen was the god of
[32:44] knowledge and he was Daniel's God and he
[32:47] had knowledge and understanding of how
[32:49] to interpret the things and our God Amen
[32:52] is a god of knowledge he is a God I
[32:54] believe brother random says it's a
[32:56] genuine Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost
[32:59] knowledge will always punctuate the word
[33:02] with an
[33:03] amen isn't it beautiful amen can I say
[33:06] this your adherence to the word of the
[33:08] age is how much power you have you say
[33:12] the truth sets me free I'll tell you
[33:14] this the truth you know sets you
[33:16] free the truth in this Bible is not
[33:19] what's setting you free it's the truth
[33:21] that's come to your heart that has set
[33:23] you free this Bible has been written for
[33:25] 2,000 years but until this knowledge
[33:28] comes into your heart Amen Let me let me
[33:30] just say this we need knowledge of him
[33:33] who is God Amen that can change every
[33:36] situation you see amen you can always
[33:38] tell a person by their knowledge of God
[33:41] how they approach things because
[33:43] sometimes you can come to situations and
[33:44] you'll say well there's no hope in this
[33:46] amen without God there's no hope right
[33:49] without God there's no hope without God
[33:51] there's no change but if you know God
[33:54] you know it doesn't there's not a situ
[33:57] situation that cannot be changed if you
[33:59] know God you know that no matter what it
[34:02] looks like there's a God that can step
[34:05] on the scene and brother Roshan can
[34:07] change a family he can change a
[34:09] situation he can change hearts and minds
[34:12] and lives amen there is nothing too hard
[34:15] for our God I say all things are
[34:18] possible with our God and if we get a
[34:20] revelation in the knowledge of him
[34:22] listen it starts taking away our
[34:24] nervousness it takes away amen that
[34:27] Spirit of depression it takes away that
[34:29] Spirit of hopelessness if you're looking
[34:31] at a situation you said brother way I
[34:33] can't find any hope I pray God give you
[34:36] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and
[34:38] the knowledge of him and that knowledge
[34:41] will overcome every nervous spirit in
[34:44] this
[34:45] building that revelation will bind every
[34:48] devil in this building this morning God
[34:52] my God he can overcome every situation
[34:55] every devil can fall at his
[34:59] feet come on I know I I I I'm I'm a man
[35:02] I live I've got family you got family we
[35:04] all got family amen we all got
[35:06] situations there's all social and and
[35:09] there's there's all kinds of situations
[35:11] isn't there amen but let me say this
[35:13] amen as long as God is here there is
[35:16] nothing that cannot be
[35:18] changed and let me say this again if
[35:21] you're facing this intellectually and
[35:23] your knowledge and your own personal and
[35:25] you got your hands on it and you're
[35:27] trying to fix it that's really what's
[35:29] wrong with it to begin with if you take
[35:31] your hands off of it and let the god of
[35:34] Mercy begin to work he can change it he
[35:37] can change
[35:38] everything sometimes it's a it's a a
[35:41] it's an underestimation can we just be
[35:43] honest we underestimate the abilities of
[35:45] God many times we underestimate it
[35:48] because you know it's kind of like a
[35:49] little boy bringing a tractor to his
[35:51] daddy amen he he's got a little broke
[35:54] got a little broke piece of a toy and he
[35:55] brings it to his dad said dad fix this
[35:58] and and and then the whole time he's
[35:59] holding
[36:00] it you know the whole time he's fooling
[36:03] with it amen if he just give it to Dad
[36:05] Dad could fix it and then he' give it
[36:07] back to him amen and if we sometimes
[36:09] just need to commit I'm tell you what a
[36:11] prophet said he said the greatest thing
[36:13] you ever done was a committal to God
[36:16] sometimes you need to commit it to God
[36:17] you need to commit it in prayer amen and
[36:20] then let the Holy Spirit begin to work
[36:23] amen and you might not know how God is
[36:25] doing it but let me proom promise you
[36:27] this our God is online even when you
[36:30] don't see him he's
[36:33] working you remember zachus the
[36:35] businessman well I'm preaching now I'm
[36:36] off my but y'all I'm I'm in the subject
[36:39] amen but zakus the businessman y'all
[36:41] remember him Amen brother man said watch
[36:43] zakus he said his wife had prayed for
[36:46] him many nights and she looked over
[36:48] there one night and he was restless and
[36:50] mean and and grouchy I'll put my words
[36:52] to it he got up fussing at her amen and
[36:54] brother man said she just laid over and
[36:56] started praising the Lord amen praising
[36:59] the Lord and your wife's grapping at you
[37:01] yeah because he his husband was gra and
[37:03] brother man said see she knew that God
[37:05] was moving on him and sometimes people
[37:08] get that way amen when they're trying to
[37:11] go their own way but the holy spirit is
[37:13] trying to turn him around and he won't
[37:15] let him go brother B said that's what
[37:17] happened to that man but God was working
[37:20] even when you don't know he's working
[37:22] and the situation starts looking like
[37:24] it's going a long ways off and and you
[37:26] get depressed and you get downhearted
[37:29] and you get to thinking I never will
[37:31] forget this as probably as long as I
[37:33] live I'll never forget this after uh
[37:35] Anna and Zach had three miscarriages
[37:38] brother Ron had told us thus sayith the
[37:40] Lord by Vision she was going to have a
[37:41] child amen I had had the Lord speak it
[37:44] directly to me listen to a tape out in
[37:46] Oklahoma amen so we had two or three
[37:49] different confirmations that God was
[37:50] going to give him a baby I'll never
[37:52] forget it I went out for a jog there in
[37:55] W Park and amen and and Carissa and Anna
[37:57] was in there and I seen Anna come up and
[38:00] she was balling and Carissa was balling
[38:03] and she said I'm going to take her out
[38:04] for a little while I come back and I was
[38:06] out and I was just jogging along and I
[38:07] was praying I said Lord I you made a
[38:10] promise to us I don't think these kids
[38:12] can take this again and I'm sitting here
[38:14] praying to the Lord and almost
[38:15] disappointed in what has happened and I
[38:17] jog back in the house and they hand me a
[38:19] little card and it's a card announcing
[38:21] the
[38:24] pregnancy them women was cuz they was
[38:27] excited and happy and and and here I'm
[38:30] thinking here I'm thinking that the
[38:32] whole world has come to an end and I'm
[38:33] ready to jump off a bridge amen and God
[38:36] was already working he he had already
[38:38] answered the prayer and may I say this
[38:41] morning that that same God is working in
[38:44] situations all over this building amen
[38:46] but the devil is trying to Blind your
[38:49] understanding to how God works and what
[38:51] he does and the situations listen I know
[38:54] we've called him out in prayer and there
[38:56] are situations that's been lingering for
[38:59] years but I say Satan we bind you in the
[39:02] name of Jesus
[39:04] Christ and we stand here this morning to
[39:07] announce that the god of Abraham is on
[39:09] the
[39:11] Move amen do you see knowledge of him I
[39:16] love it how how how the spirit of wisdom
[39:18] and Revelation and knowledge amen but
[39:20] watch how Paul breaks into this nurse
[39:22] verse and he said that the eyes of your
[39:25] understanding being in lightened or that
[39:27] your eyes of your heart be flooded with
[39:31] light woo brother that the heart let it
[39:36] be flooded with light now this this word
[39:39] enlightened here it it means to give
[39:43] light it it means not just a light but
[39:46] it means to give light like it is um uh
[39:50] when when something is shined into the
[39:52] eyes it it is giving light to the
[39:55] individual let me just take you to the
[39:57] scripture in Matthew 6 and22 these are
[39:59] the words of the Lord he said for the
[40:01] light of the body is the
[40:04] eye if therefore Thine Eyes shall be
[40:08] single thy whole body shall be full of
[40:12] light but if thine eye be evil the whole
[40:16] body shall be full of Darkness if
[40:18] therefore the light that is in the
[40:20] darkness How Great is Thy Darkness I
[40:24] read it from The Book of Luke saying
[40:26] Luke 11:34 the light of the body is the
[40:28] eye therefore when the eye is single the
[40:30] whole body is full of light and when
[40:33] thine eye is evil the body also is full
[40:36] of Darkness now take heed therefore the
[40:38] light which is in thee be not
[40:42] Darkness isn't that amazing if thine
[40:45] whole body therefore be full of light
[40:47] having no part dark the whole shall be
[40:49] full of light as when the bright shining
[40:51] of a candle doeth give
[40:54] light I love how this is spoken if the
[40:57] light of the body is the eye now this is
[41:01] speaking prophetic right to a church to
[41:04] a body of Believers to a to an end time
[41:08] group if the eye be single the whole
[41:11] body shall be full of light listen you
[41:14] don't have trouble till you have more
[41:16] than one
[41:19] voice you don't have trouble till you
[41:22] have more than one voice and I I want to
[41:23] say that in this in this second in this
[41:26] moment see I appreciate brother Ericson
[41:29] and the revelation God has given him and
[41:32] and and how somebody asked me one time
[41:34] said brother Wayne how's that going to
[41:35] work with you and brother Ray I said
[41:36] real good I said because Brother Ray
[41:38] will never say or do anything outside
[41:40] what brother Ram
[41:42] taught and as long as I don't ever do or
[41:44] say anything outside he taught there's a
[41:46] perfect
[41:49] harmony a perfect harmony so you only
[41:52] have one
[41:54] voice but see it's only when another
[41:56] voice tries to come into that that the
[41:59] trouble begins so let's just say you're
[42:02] you're you go back to the Garden of Eden
[42:04] that's a beautiful place beautiful
[42:05] fellowship and Eve was fellowshipping
[42:08] with the Lord but here come the
[42:10] serpent right and he took his at the
[42:14] Lord also said yeah or hath the Lord
[42:17] said you know I me he just twisted
[42:19] something just a little bit but it was
[42:21] that voice for the serpent that broke
[42:25] the fellowship in the garden eaten and
[42:27] and a Believer can have perfect
[42:29] fellowship with God Amen just easing
[42:32] along right under the message of the
[42:33] hour amen and watch and somebody will
[42:36] come along and say well I don't know if
[42:37] brother Bram was right about that I
[42:40] don't know if that was exactly how that
[42:42] ought to been now what they're doing is
[42:45] amen you think they're just offering you
[42:47] a little different idea but really what
[42:50] they're doing is they're raping and
[42:52] robbing your entire
[42:55] life now watch brother bam said he said
[42:58] when Eve fail for Satan's lie and she
[43:01] allowed that he said the whole world fa
[43:03] he said and so a church he said whenever
[43:06] amen that we receive something outside
[43:08] the word everything under it begins to
[43:11] fall amen you watch a family you watch a
[43:13] father start moving out of the word
[43:16] watch how it starts affecting the whole
[43:18] entire thing when Adam fell the whole
[43:21] world fell now amen what what am I
[43:23] speaking about I'm talking about the
[43:25] singleness of the eye amen if you just
[43:28] keep your eye I remember years ago
[43:30] somebody come and they they had the and
[43:32] and you forgive me if you believe this I
[43:33] I I can't believe it but but but there
[43:35] were some people uh who had this two
[43:37] Lord Doctrine and and they were telling
[43:39] me there was one God but there was two
[43:40] Lords and they took a bunch of quotes
[43:42] and they tried to make them match one
[43:44] another and they were telling me all
[43:45] their ideas of all this and I said but
[43:47] but don't you don't you listen to what
[43:49] brother random said about that and the
[43:52] man says to me this very thing he says
[43:54] well we used to listen to brother
[43:56] brother bam he said but it confuses us
[43:59] now and I said confuses you he said yeah
[44:02] well they was listening to a certain
[44:03] teacher and as long as they just listen
[44:05] to that teacher say what brother Bram
[44:07] said then there was no confusion but
[44:09] when they actually heard the prophet
[44:12] they was hearing something different
[44:13] than what was coming through the
[44:15] teaching and so there was a confusion he
[44:18] said he said well don't you get confused
[44:20] I said no sir I said I was confused till
[44:22] I heard brother bram's tape but when I
[44:25] heard brother eny straighten the whole
[44:26] thing out for me now I tell you how God
[44:29] works about a week later I was listening
[44:32] to a tape and brother Bram was on there
[44:34] he said there was one of my friends the
[44:35] other day with a group of guys and he
[44:37] said they said we don't listen to that
[44:39] William brandom he said because he
[44:41] confuses us and brother Bram said he
[44:42] spoke up and said well I was confused
[44:44] till I heard him yeah I said that's
[44:47] right that's right the Lord knew it was
[44:49] coming so so a lot of times the
[44:52] confusions that we're dealing with is
[44:55] not coming from from the
[44:59] message it's coming from what you're
[45:01] hearing maybe another preacher say and
[45:04] then you hear them say it and then
[45:06] you're listening to the tape and you go
[45:08] well that's not really what brother
[45:09] Braham said about that but don't be
[45:12] confused set aside what the brother said
[45:15] and believe what the word said that just
[45:18] makes things so easy when you're able
[45:21] because what is happening you have a
[45:23] single eye y'all y'all know what I'm
[45:25] talking about brother man said him and
[45:26] Billy Paul stopped and he said there was
[45:28] a anvelope out in the field and he said
[45:31] Billy handed me the binoculars and said
[45:33] here now watch he's looking through
[45:34] something he said look out there at that
[45:37] anvelope and he said when I pulled it up
[45:39] there were three of them out there yeah
[45:41] he said I pulled them down there was
[45:42] just one see looking through them lenses
[45:46] made it look a certain way that was not
[45:48] real but brother BR said but what they
[45:50] needed was a little focusing and
[45:53] sometimes you can look at something
[45:54] through somebody else's it's when
[45:56] somebody tried to teach me a a Doctrine
[45:58] one time on and I don't know where I'm
[45:59] at but God bless y'all y'all keep
[46:01] pulling amen somebody was trying to uh
[46:03] uh put this idea about this return
[46:06] Ministry and they were go they were
[46:07] going on and on about this return
[46:09] Ministry and I said well I tell you what
[46:10] you do just send me all them quotes yeah
[46:13] and I'll sit down and go over them
[46:16] brother Ed God bless you amen I said
[46:18] just I'll go over them and you know amen
[46:20] what they did they said well I just had
[46:22] to come and sit down and go over it with
[46:23] you I said you mean what I need out of
[46:26] them I can't get by the Holy Spirit I'm
[46:28] going to have to have you right amen uh
[46:30] one guy says to me he said uh uh uh they
[46:32] went to all tapes in a church and they
[46:34] don't believe in live Ministry anymore
[46:36] so they cornered one of my daughters at
[46:38] a place and they said well said uh uh
[46:40] what we should do is everybody sit down
[46:41] all the preachers and play tapes and
[46:43] they said well uh is that right they
[46:45] said yeah I think that's right my
[46:47] daughter comes into my office and one of
[46:48] them and she said to me she said Dad she
[46:50] said what do I do I said well you tell
[46:52] him this you tell him to give him all
[46:54] the quotes where brother Bram said that
[46:56] and you'll examine them but meanwhile
[46:58] you send all these quotes and ask him
[47:01] what he thinks about them and there's
[47:02] about 300 pages of quotes of what the
[47:05] prophet had to say about live Ministry
[47:08] and you know what there's not even one
[47:10] time that brother brandom said Ministry
[47:12] should sit down and let somebody else
[47:14] amen play a tape in the church amen do
[47:17] you see what it is it's only confusing
[47:19] if you're not willing to take it to the
[47:21] word of God Amen watch Martin y'all
[47:23] remember it back there with Martin amen
[47:25] when when he was a leader of that school
[47:27] and this guy come and said I got this
[47:29] light on me and I'm the ruler I'm the
[47:31] leader of everybody and they said well
[47:33] amen that's good let's go down and talk
[47:35] to Martin amen he didn't want to go down
[47:37] there he said he had a light the man was
[47:40] carrying a light but take it to the
[47:42] message of the age and see how well that
[47:45] light shines and they started dragging
[47:47] him down there and when they did the
[47:49] light went away amen and I found out if
[47:51] you just bring it back to the message of
[47:54] the hour that the teaching now the word
[47:56] of God will bring Clarity to the mind of
[47:59] the church you see what it is is the
[48:01] light of the body now here's the thing I
[48:04] love how the scriptures are read here it
[48:06] says thine whole body shall be full of
[48:08] light now y'all enjoy scriptural
[48:10] promises amen look in Matthew chapter 6
[48:13] and verse 22 if thine eye be single the
[48:16] whole body shall be full of light that's
[48:18] a promise shall be light Jesus says that
[48:23] shall be light now I love it because the
[48:26] Bible's going to prophesy this to us and
[48:28] it's going to be in Zechariah the 14th
[48:30] chapter it'll say that in the evening
[48:34] time there shall be light can can I just
[48:38] say this Zachariah was not living in an
[48:40] electrical
[48:42] age so he wasn't prophesying the
[48:45] electricity was coming he was talking
[48:47] about the manifestation of the scripture
[48:50] as it says in John chapter one it says
[48:52] that John was a light but he was not the
[48:55] light but Jesus was the True Light that
[48:58] lights every man in other words it was
[49:00] the scripture amen it wasn't John wasn't
[49:03] false light but he wasn't the True Light
[49:05] he wasn't the complete it's the same as
[49:07] brother random told us he said look I'm
[49:09] not
[49:10] him I'm not the one you seek but he's
[49:14] here he's in the midst of you amen when
[49:16] when you see that brother Brandon was a
[49:18] light for his season amen now now I know
[49:23] that could get a little sticky but let's
[49:24] just be let's just be honest here right
[49:27] there was Lutheran light and there was
[49:29] wesleyian light there was Pentecostal
[49:31] light amen and watch now and some people
[49:34] have tried to make that brandom light
[49:36] but brother brandom said I never come to
[49:38] do that at all he said I come to bring
[49:40] brid light he said I come to connect you
[49:44] to the headship which is the word turned
[49:47] on in this
[49:48] age amen it's an evening light can I
[49:51] just resay it so you catch my
[49:53] inspiration in the evening time there
[49:55] shall be light now watch this in the
[49:57] evening time scripture will be
[50:01] fulfilled light is the word
[50:04] Vindicated it is scripture it's the word
[50:07] made flesh in Zechariah 14:7 amen what
[50:11] is it talking about it's talking about
[50:13] in the evening time now the reason it
[50:15] calls it the evening time because the
[50:17] sun sets and the sun rises and the same
[50:21] Sun that was in the East is supposed to
[50:23] set in the west amen it's a beautiful
[50:26] thing if you ever see a good picture of
[50:27] a sunrise you can't tell the difference
[50:29] if it's sunrise or sunet amen because if
[50:32] you don't know the Direction you don't
[50:33] know the difference CU it's the same son
[50:36] and as the son of man Rose in the East
[50:39] so shall he manifest in the west as
[50:42] Lightning Cometh From the East and the
[50:44] West so shall the coming of the son of
[50:46] man be and in the setting of the Sun in
[50:49] Zachariah it shall be light in the
[50:51] evening time oh in second Peter chapter
[50:54] 1 I love how Apostle Peter brings this
[50:57] in if you uh in verse 19 if you're in a
[51:00] if you're a Bible student you study
[51:02] Matthew the 17th chapter Peter James and
[51:04] John were with Jesus when they went on
[51:06] Transfiguration right they went up there
[51:08] together and in second Peter chapter 1
[51:11] the latter half of the scripture Peter
[51:14] is actually giving his version of what
[51:17] happened on that mountain am and when he
[51:20] begins to tell it in the in second Peter
[51:22] chapter 1 give me that 19 L here's Peter
[51:25] speaking of it he said we also have a
[51:28] more sure word of
[51:29] Prophecy now what's more sure than
[51:32] prophecy the Fulfillment thereof now how
[51:35] many people had read Isaiah and thought
[51:38] that was the Virgin or that was the case
[51:41] or that was and how many sermons had
[51:42] said this is this and this is this but
[51:44] the sure word is fulfillment we're unto
[51:48] you that you take heed as a light that
[51:52] shineth in a dark place until the day
[51:55] Dawn and the day star arise in your
[51:59] hearts amen you said preacher what are
[52:01] you talking about I'm talking about
[52:03] Vindicated word in your heart amen you
[52:06] ever let Vindicated word get in your
[52:08] heart and they'll never stop the Saints
[52:11] of the Living God with Vindicated word
[52:14] in their hearts amen it's a day star
[52:16] that arises in your hearts if you wonder
[52:18] about it read the next verse the 20th
[52:20] verse explains it knowing this verse
[52:22] that no Prophecy of the scripture is of
[52:24] any private
[52:26] interpretation it don't matter what
[52:28] anybody said Isaiah was Jesus fulfilled
[52:32] it don't matter what anybody says
[52:35] Malachi 4 means brother Brandon
[52:37] fulfilled it don't matter what anybody
[52:39] thinks about Ephesians 5 that there'll
[52:41] be a glorious Church somebody has the
[52:44] interpretation of that right now this
[52:46] morning amen what is it it's a day star
[52:49] that arises in the heart can I give you
[52:51] scripture here Isaiah the 60th chapter
[52:54] now the heart flooded with light let's
[52:56] get some light can we Amen in second
[52:58] Peter it's a day star it's the
[53:00] Fulfillment of the word in Isaiah
[53:02] chapter 60 let's watch the first verse
[53:04] of Isaiah 60 arise and shine for thy
[53:08] light is come and the glory of the Lord
[53:11] has risen upon thee my let's go down to
[53:14] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[53:16] Earth and gross Darkness the people but
[53:18] the Lord shall arise upon thee as the
[53:21] glory shall be seen upon thee the next
[53:24] verse and the Gentiles shall come to thy
[53:26] light and to the Kings to the brightness
[53:29] of thy Rising isn't that beautiful arise
[53:32] and shine thy light has come the bride
[53:35] light has arrived in the end time it is
[53:39] the bride light that we were looking for
[53:41] Isaiah 60 veres 1 to3 watch 2
[53:44] Corinthians chapter 4 and the 6th verse
[53:47] here's another example for God who
[53:49] commanded the light to shine out of the
[53:53] darkness my goodness isn't it something
[53:56] when there was no light at all God said
[53:59] let there be
[54:00] light now where is the source of light
[54:03] you asked yourself that if there is
[54:05] complete darkness where do you get light
[54:08] but the source of all light is the word
[54:12] of God in the beginning God spoke and
[54:16] said let there be light if there's any
[54:18] light in this age it will have to come
[54:20] from the word of God the light of the
[54:22] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[54:24] face of Jesus Christ watch the next
[54:25] verse in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and
[54:29] verse 8 and then shall the wicked be
[54:31] revealed and whom the Lord shall consume
[54:33] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[54:35] destroy him with the brightness of his
[54:38] coming amen go to uh Revelation 8 and
[54:42] verse 4 amen verse one down to four amen
[54:45] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[54:47] coming Amen in Revelations 18 sorry
[54:50] verses 1 to 4 amen and the whole earth
[54:52] the Bible said would be lighted with his
[54:55] glory and I saw an angel come down from
[54:57] heaven sounds like Revelations 10 don't
[54:59] it having a great power and the Earth
[55:02] was lighted with his glory and the Earth
[55:06] was lighted with his glory if you read
[55:08] the fourth verse it said come out of my
[55:10] people and be not partakers and brother
[55:13] Ram says that's the seventh angel
[55:15] messenger he brought a light that would
[55:17] lighten this entire planet if the
[55:20] people's hearts were open there's enough
[55:23] light this morning to flood every heart
[55:26] in this loud to see and age no man would
[55:29] have to live in darkness there is no
[55:31] excuse for a Believer this morning
[55:33] setting in darkness there is a light
[55:35] that has come that is a light that will
[55:37] destroy Satan come on now I'm in the
[55:41] Bible if the word made flesh is light
[55:44] yes sir can we get on that word made
[55:46] flesh is light then in in the Book of
[55:49] John it said he was manifested he was
[55:52] manifested you know why he was
[55:54] manifested to destroy the works of the
[55:57] devil and brother if you want to destroy
[55:59] the Devil put some light on the works of
[56:01] the
[56:03] enemy you can have the best set of eyes
[56:05] in the world but if you're sitting in
[56:06] darkness it don't matter you yeah I know
[56:09] y'all know what I'm talking about you
[56:10] ever laid in bed at night and you looked
[56:12] up and seen a shadow and something
[56:13] hanging on the door and man you just
[56:15] about need to crawl under the bed you
[56:17] know
[56:18] am but if you turn the light on it
[56:22] wasn't what you thought it was at all
[56:25] but the light is what changed it the
[56:27] situation never changed but the light
[56:30] shed light on it and revealed to you
[56:32] what you were doing and I'll tell you
[56:34] this amen if God's going to send light
[56:36] in this end time there had to be a eye
[56:39] to catch that
[56:40] light now let me let me just say this if
[56:43] you was blind this morning and you just
[56:46] just shut your eyes just just it don't
[56:48] matter how much light you pour in this
[56:50] building if you're blind light doesn't
[56:53] do no good right yeah it does you no
[56:56] good at all because the eye is the way
[56:59] light gets into the
[57:01] body light has no other
[57:04] access than through the eye amen so
[57:08] brother brandom tells us as a church
[57:10] body we're not in the foot age right he
[57:14] said we're not in the hip age we're not
[57:16] in the shoulder age he said we're not
[57:18] even in the age of the tongues of the
[57:20] Pentecostal Church speaking he said
[57:23] we've moved up into the eye
[57:25] see what good would it do for God to
[57:28] send light if there was no Prophet on
[57:30] the earth to receive the light when it
[57:32] come oh I thank God this morning to know
[57:36] that there was a true Prophet on the
[57:37] earth and when a light began to shine
[57:39] into the Earth that light was not coming
[57:42] from brother brandham he was just there
[57:44] when God began to do these things and
[57:47] bring light to the situation amen I
[57:49] thank God this morning to see amen that
[57:52] there had to be light and it was in the
[57:54] evening time now what light is going to
[57:56] do is light is going to shine on your
[58:00] needs now Sister Kimberly amen I love
[58:02] how the Bible is written and it says God
[58:04] so loved the world that he gave his only
[58:05] begotten son isn't it
[58:07] beautiful now he gave his only begotten
[58:10] son that nobody should
[58:12] perish is that right isn't it amazing
[58:15] that the blood that Jesus said and I
[58:17] don't think anybody could disagree with
[58:18] this it saves everybody it saves the
[58:21] whole world even a child that dies
[58:23] before the age of a account saved
[58:26] because the sin of the world is what
[58:27] Adam and Eve did and the blood covers
[58:30] everybody if somebody dies without
[58:33] receiving the blood then they go into
[58:35] the presence of God without the blood
[58:37] and that's when they're really in
[58:38] trouble with God but right now there's a
[58:41] blood covering the whole earth and
[58:42] everybody's under that
[58:45] blood that's the scripture amen and
[58:47] everybody's under that blood you say
[58:49] well then preacher what are you talking
[58:51] about then the Bible said but that but
[58:53] there some that didn't believe upon the
[58:55] name of the only begotten son because
[58:58] they love Darkness more than they love
[59:02] light now C can y'all can y'all handle
[59:05] if I get into something a little bit
[59:06] here look look in John 3 uh look in John
[59:10] 3 want show you something it's very
[59:12] beautiful here it this is this is so
[59:14] powerful look in John chapter 3 for God
[59:16] so loved the world that he gave his only
[59:17] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[59:20] him should not perish but have
[59:21] everlasting life for God sent not his
[59:23] son into the world to condemn The World
[59:25] Isn't that beautiful but that he the
[59:28] world through him might be
[59:31] saved that he believeth on him not
[59:34] condemned but he that believeth not is
[59:37] condemned
[59:38] already because he ha not believed in
[59:42] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[59:45] so everybody said well as long as you
[59:47] say Jesus everybody
[59:49] saved but what is the name now if you go
[59:52] back in the scripture this is beautiful
[59:54] because the the Bible said you can only
[59:55] Worship in the gate where he put his
[59:58] name there's a lot of gates there's a
[1:00:01] lot of churches there's a lot of Creeds
[1:00:03] there's a lot of thoughts but you can
[1:00:05] only worship where he puts his name now
[1:00:08] now y'all are students of this message
[1:00:11] and brother B said a name of God is the
[1:00:13] word interpreted in that age it is a
[1:00:17] manifestation of that name that's why he
[1:00:19] preaches the message Look Away to Jesus
[1:00:22] and then tells five manifestations of
[1:00:24] the Third
[1:00:25] where God is fulfilling his word is
[1:00:27] where his name is come on church amen
[1:00:31] his name is his word manifested in that
[1:00:35] age now I'll tell you what brother ramam
[1:00:37] says in the first seal buckle your seat
[1:00:39] belts now he said when the when the when
[1:00:41] the Thunder sounded he said he received
[1:00:43] a new
[1:00:45] name he said now he says watch he said
[1:00:49] that's the reason they're out here
[1:00:51] hollering Jesus and they're not getting
[1:00:53] anything
[1:00:55] people said well that's not possible is
[1:00:57] it not Elijah in his day on the mountain
[1:01:00] amen called out for God under the
[1:01:03] revelation of Jehovah and those other
[1:01:05] men called for God under the revelation
[1:01:07] of Baal and this denominational system
[1:01:10] is calling the name of Jesus but they're
[1:01:13] doing it under the understanding of a
[1:01:15] horse system and they're worshiping the
[1:01:18] devil and don't even know they're doing
[1:01:21] it and you try to give them light but
[1:01:24] they love their Creeds more than they
[1:01:26] love the word of God now we might as
[1:01:29] well go ahead and say it amen everybody
[1:01:31] said love love got to love everybody but
[1:01:33] the Bible said that they receive the
[1:01:36] spirit of of delusion because they love
[1:01:39] not the
[1:01:40] truth come on folks the truth must have
[1:01:43] you must have a love for truth A Love
[1:01:46] For Truth is what will carry the church
[1:01:49] Beyond Creeds and dogmas and ideas
[1:01:51] brother I tell you I'm very loyal to my
[1:01:53] church well God bless you for being
[1:01:54] loyal but I'm not asking you to be loyal
[1:01:57] to a church I'm asking you to be
[1:01:58] faithful for Christ when you enter in I
[1:02:01] want him to say to you Levi thou are a
[1:02:03] good and a faithful servant I don't want
[1:02:06] him to say you've been a loyal member of
[1:02:08] the church what if the church leaves the
[1:02:10] word the prophet said leave the
[1:02:14] church I'm going to tell you what the
[1:02:16] prophet said he said if the oh
[1:02:20] God follow it follow the man he said but
[1:02:24] when the man leaves the
[1:02:28] word now you said why would you do that
[1:02:30] because there has to be a love of Truth
[1:02:33] are we married to the preacher or are we
[1:02:36] married to Christ are we married to the
[1:02:38] church or are we married to Christ I
[1:02:41] tell you who I married I remarried the
[1:02:43] revealed word of the Hour his name is
[1:02:46] Jesus Christ I'm not married to a bunch
[1:02:49] of doctrines and a bunch of ideas Jesus
[1:02:52] is a person and he's here this this
[1:02:54] morning he's a man turning on the Lights
[1:02:58] of the church that's why they wasn't get
[1:03:00] nothing they're saying Jesus but they're
[1:03:02] not getting it somebody said well
[1:03:03] brother Wayne that's not hardly you know
[1:03:05] everything's done through the I know but
[1:03:07] what Jesus you talking
[1:03:09] about you talking about the Methodist
[1:03:11] one the Baptist one the Lutheran
[1:03:16] One y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[1:03:20] come accept Jesus and then walk away Bob
[1:03:22] hered and Brites and go ahead hooped
[1:03:24] earrings and make up and shout and
[1:03:26] holler Y and brother Bram said dead thus
[1:03:30] saith the Lord
[1:03:33] dead that's tough stuff ain't it it's
[1:03:36] true brother B said when you cut
[1:03:38] yourself off from the word you're dead
[1:03:40] yeah right now watch because that's
[1:03:44] exactly what Satan wants to do is pull
[1:03:46] you by your human
[1:03:50] emotions human emotion and pulled away
[1:03:53] from the word of God
[1:03:55] I I think it's powerful when you start
[1:03:58] seeing that brother Braham said they
[1:04:00] call but they wasn't get nothing because
[1:04:02] he had received a new name under the
[1:04:04] revelation of the seals it revealed the
[1:04:08] new name of the Lord now it's it didn't
[1:04:10] change it his name is still
[1:04:13] Jesus but you finally understand who he
[1:04:16] really
[1:04:18] is Right amen he's he's the real the
[1:04:23] real Jesus yeah we could say this could
[1:04:25] the real Jesus stand
[1:04:29] up you see what what we're what we're
[1:04:31] dealing with is is we're dealing with a
[1:04:34] real G now if if you if you wonder about
[1:04:36] my Revelation on that check Matthew 25
[1:04:38] there's five wise virgins and five
[1:04:40] foolish virgins and they're all virgins
[1:04:43] and they all
[1:04:45] believe y amen but they didn't get the
[1:04:48] oil did they and brother Bram said he he
[1:04:52] exactly typed it he said the ones under
[1:04:55] Elijah got something he said because
[1:04:58] when the Vindicated word struck there
[1:05:00] was a voice sounded out behind them and
[1:05:02] said our God is
[1:05:04] God right but the other on screamed
[1:05:08] hollered beat their altars didn't get
[1:05:10] nothing oh my and brother BR said the
[1:05:13] Bible said they wouldn't in the end time
[1:05:15] they're looking for the oil goes to
[1:05:16] Matthew 25 he said they don't get the
[1:05:21] oil right see they're they're not
[1:05:24] that's that's a deep subject I know but
[1:05:26] what they didn't do is they didn't go on
[1:05:27] with the word simply they didn't go on
[1:05:31] with the word now when you see this then
[1:05:34] you see the scriptures are saying that
[1:05:37] they're condemned already now there's
[1:05:39] enough atonement and we we could take
[1:05:41] scripture and prove it but I'll just say
[1:05:43] I think you believe it easily there's
[1:05:45] enough atonement save everybody that's
[1:05:48] right one drop of the blood of Jesus
[1:05:50] saves everybody everybody's saved then
[1:05:53] why does Isaiah say that we'll have to
[1:05:56] enlarge the borders of
[1:06:00] hell why does the bible plainly say
[1:06:02] there will be
[1:06:04] many yeah there'll be many called but
[1:06:07] few are chosen and he starts talking
[1:06:09] about the idea that people go to hell so
[1:06:11] somebody says well why is God send
[1:06:13] anybody to hell he
[1:06:14] don't brother he don't send anybody to
[1:06:17] Hell
[1:06:19] amen
[1:06:21] now with that atonement how How would be
[1:06:26] possible now John says we walk in the
[1:06:32] light as he is in the
[1:06:37] light and we have fellowship with him we
[1:06:40] walk in the light as he's in the light
[1:06:44] so you're
[1:06:46] moving you're moving in the mercy you're
[1:06:49] moving in the Revelation and as he moves
[1:06:52] you move you walk in the light now what
[1:06:54] happens if the light goes
[1:06:57] off in the book of Hebrews the scripture
[1:07:01] says that whenever they turned there was
[1:07:04] no more sacrifice for their
[1:07:08] sin what happened to the
[1:07:11] sacrifice it wasn't that somebody
[1:07:13] carried it
[1:07:14] off it's that they moved into
[1:07:19] darkness and they can no longer see the
[1:07:22] atonement
[1:07:24] see the light the light is
[1:07:28] shining is shining on
[1:07:31] it let me let me just bring this into a
[1:07:34] reality the light that shines in your
[1:07:36] heart it lets you see the atonement and
[1:07:39] if you go back to the scripture watch
[1:07:40] what brother Bram will say here or the
[1:07:42] scripture when the Lord he'll say this
[1:07:44] he say now you be careful that your
[1:07:47] light be not Darkness I got some good
[1:07:50] quotes don't have time to read them you
[1:07:52] be careful that your light be not
[1:07:55] Darkness now what what's that speaking
[1:07:57] of people's
[1:07:59] Revelation now brother Bram takes Adam
[1:08:02] and Eve in the garden and he goes that
[1:08:04] they came and the devil gave a
[1:08:06] revelation to Eve right the Bible says
[1:08:09] and she
[1:08:10] saw she saw it she saw what the devil as
[1:08:15] to make one wise it's always marveled me
[1:08:18] cu the devil can't make a wise
[1:08:20] virgin but she said he made he can make
[1:08:23] us wise
[1:08:24] and brother Bram said she caught new
[1:08:27] light and that new light's what plunged
[1:08:29] her into darkness yeah amen see what she
[1:08:32] the understanding she
[1:08:35] caught plunged her away from the
[1:08:38] atonement let me let me just say
[1:08:39] somebody says to you well there's no
[1:08:41] more there's the the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:43] Ghost ain't real
[1:08:45] anymore you accept that in your
[1:08:49] heart and it'll plunge you into a place
[1:08:51] of
[1:08:52] Darkness right
[1:08:54] and people all around you can be
[1:08:58] experiencing the power of
[1:09:00] God but you'll set in
[1:09:02] darkness because what you've accepted
[1:09:05] darkened your
[1:09:07] understanding somebody say well God just
[1:09:10] don't speak in tongues
[1:09:11] anymore now here's the thing God still
[1:09:14] does and people still
[1:09:17] will but you're not
[1:09:21] involved see God will still moveed the
[1:09:24] same as he's always moved amen just like
[1:09:27] the Lutheran sitting there saying God
[1:09:29] don't do them things anymore and brother
[1:09:31] Bram standing there saying your name is
[1:09:32] so and so and your name is so and so and
[1:09:34] this is h and a worldwide Revival and
[1:09:37] the Lutheran saying it don't happen it
[1:09:40] can't happen but it was happening
[1:09:43] anyhow but to them that opened their
[1:09:46] hearts to it the light was flooding
[1:09:49] their hearts and they were believing the
[1:09:51] word of God listen if if the Twisted
[1:09:54] words of a man could plunge a person
[1:09:57] into darkness into confusion what
[1:10:00] happens if that heart is opened up to
[1:10:02] the true word of God then a person
[1:10:05] setting in darkness can be drugg right
[1:10:07] out into the greatest Revival that has
[1:10:10] ever struck the planet a person who is
[1:10:13] completely involved in neurotics and and
[1:10:15] they're have you ever seen somebody in
[1:10:17] the grips of it they're just in the
[1:10:19] grips of it there's nothing they can do
[1:10:21] they're just they're just gripped by
[1:10:22] this dark thing but you let the Holy
[1:10:24] Ghost break in there and let an
[1:10:27] understanding strike that heart that
[1:10:29] there's a light coming to this age and
[1:10:31] God is still real and God is still true
[1:10:34] then what it'll do it'll Shake That
[1:10:36] believer it'll Shake That believer and
[1:10:39] it'll open their eyes to things that are
[1:10:42] literally Open the Eyes of our heart
[1:10:44] Lord our understanding it is a spiritual
[1:10:47] understanding amen can can I just I I
[1:10:50] take you on a trip with Elijah and and
[1:10:52] and Gaza and you think there's a lot of
[1:10:54] enemies have you ever been there
[1:10:56] everything's against me everybody's
[1:10:57] against me amen everything's all
[1:10:59] everything's around me but you know what
[1:11:01] brother Eric there was something come
[1:11:03] from that Prophet when he said Lord open
[1:11:05] this boy's eyes that he might be able to
[1:11:08] see amen he didn't do anything but open
[1:11:11] his eyes and when his eyes were open he
[1:11:13] was enlightened to the idea that there
[1:11:17] were angels in this
[1:11:19] building isn't it something there were
[1:11:21] angels in the building I've always loved
[1:11:22] to speak about that a little bit because
[1:11:24] one thing I found out those angels
[1:11:26] didn't do anything in that battle
[1:11:29] brother Levi the Angels didn't get in
[1:11:30] the battle at all but they gave an
[1:11:33] assurance to the man who was in the
[1:11:35] battle that God was with them and the
[1:11:38] same God that opened the eyes of Gaza is
[1:11:41] the same God that blinded the eyes of
[1:11:44] the king of Syria can you imagine they
[1:11:46] were standing looking at Elijah and they
[1:11:48] didn't even know it God can open one
[1:11:50] man's eyes and blind another they can
[1:11:53] stand and look at the very answer and
[1:11:55] not know they're looking at it Amen
[1:11:57] brother B said I would rather be
[1:11:58] naturally blind as spiritually blind
[1:12:01] because you can't see anything God has
[1:12:04] when you're spiritually blind but let me
[1:12:05] say something this morning I thank God
[1:12:08] that it's written in the Book of
[1:12:09] Revelations amen that what we should
[1:12:11] pray for is ISA that we might be able to
[1:12:16] see I don't know if you ever read
[1:12:17] Revelations 3 over Ephesians 1 but it's
[1:12:19] a beautiful read but that we might have
[1:12:21] eyesa we might see so let's just let's
[1:12:24] just ask the prophet brother brandom if
[1:12:26] if we were in blind Le osia and we want
[1:12:29] eyesight how do we get it what do we
[1:12:31] pray for how do we pray that our eyes
[1:12:33] would come open brother Bram says it he
[1:12:35] says this is what you what you would do
[1:12:37] he said see when I was a kid he said my
[1:12:40] daddy was a a Trapper and he'd TR
[1:12:42] rat Coons and he would take the lard off
[1:12:44] of the and put in a A can y'all
[1:12:47] know how grease is it'll it'll harden up
[1:12:49] when it gets cold you know and he said
[1:12:50] there'd be a can of that grease sitting
[1:12:52] over there and and he said because we
[1:12:54] lived in a house with draft and he said
[1:12:56] we lay in the bed he said cold draft
[1:12:57] come in he said' when we woke up in the
[1:12:59] morning our eyes would be matted shut
[1:13:01] y'all ever had any mat in your eyes uh
[1:13:04] it's it's it's something's a matter
[1:13:06] right or something it's something matter
[1:13:09] them eyes is matted up and and and
[1:13:11] brother R said when we woke up we
[1:13:12] couldn't see he said so they would go
[1:13:14] over and get the Kung grees and he said
[1:13:17] we'd heat it up on the stove a bit he
[1:13:19] said because it needs to be heated up
[1:13:21] good before it's applied to the ey
[1:13:24] he said then we'd take a little that and
[1:13:25] we'd start wiping he said in that Co
[1:13:28] grease would wipe that offer he said
[1:13:29] matter of fact he said it's pretty much
[1:13:31] a fix all he said we put it on the seals
[1:13:33] of our shoes and he said we put it on
[1:13:35] this and do this he said done all kinds
[1:13:37] of wonderful things it was about a fix
[1:13:38] all and then brother Bram turns and he
[1:13:40] said and you know what he said here in
[1:13:42] the Church of La osia there's been a
[1:13:44] cold spell and he said many eyes have
[1:13:47] been maded shut he said but we're going
[1:13:49] to have to have more than kung GRE to
[1:13:51] open these eyes he said we're going to
[1:13:53] need the Holy Ghost he said so what
[1:13:56] should we do he said heat it up real
[1:13:58] good I know people don't like them
[1:14:00] heating up services but once in a while
[1:14:02] we need to heat it up a little good amen
[1:14:04] you come into the house of God and every
[1:14:06] devil Out of Hell sitting on you trying
[1:14:08] to fight with the service and you feel
[1:14:10] the pressure of it and you feel the
[1:14:11] oppression well I tell you if you could
[1:14:13] see it what it is it's dark spirits that
[1:14:16] don't want to see the service get so
[1:14:17] high because evil does not want to see
[1:14:20] the Holy Ghost ruling in the Church of
[1:14:22] the Living God but if you start heating
[1:14:24] it up a little bit amen and you start
[1:14:26] heating that Spirit up say how do I do
[1:14:28] it brother with a Hallelujah and a glory
[1:14:30] to God and Devil you can't have my
[1:14:33] service amen it's going to be a good
[1:14:35] morning in the Holy Spirit and when you
[1:14:37] start heating it up start putting it on
[1:14:39] the eyes and brother B said eyes start
[1:14:42] coming
[1:14:43] open eyes start coming open I'll tell
[1:14:46] you what brother B said what we need is
[1:14:48] that Holy Ghost amen we need a fix all
[1:14:50] don't we and I believe the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:52] a fix all to the Church of the Living
[1:14:54] God and look what he says he says what
[1:14:57] he was doing brother Bram says what he's
[1:14:59] doing is the Holy Ghost has to get in to
[1:15:03] the heart to fix the
[1:15:07] eyesight Luke 24 you've read the story
[1:15:11] two's walking on the road to EMAs and
[1:15:13] Jesus appears to them who is he he's
[1:15:17] everything he promised to be they
[1:15:18] couldn't see it so he took them in a
[1:15:21] little room in the evening and he broke
[1:15:26] bread and them that were slow to
[1:15:30] understand their eyes come
[1:15:32] open when he got inside their eyes come
[1:15:37] open brother BR said that's exactly what
[1:15:40] opened Peter's
[1:15:42] eyes that was exactly what opened the
[1:15:45] woman at the well what opened her eyes
[1:15:47] he says what has this message did for
[1:15:50] your
[1:15:51] eyes if if it opened their eyes in that
[1:15:54] day won't it open your eyes in this day
[1:15:57] you said preacher how to open eyes open
[1:15:59] your heart and say Lord come on in this
[1:16:02] Heart come in my heart brother man said
[1:16:05] don't let him stand at the front door he
[1:16:07] said invite him on
[1:16:09] in and there's doors down there there
[1:16:12] brother Bram said there's doors of every
[1:16:13] kind of door in there he said but one of
[1:16:15] them doors is your
[1:16:16] sight he said so invite him into your
[1:16:19] sight yeah amen and even if a man was
[1:16:23] naturally
[1:16:25] blind the Holy Spirit could bring a
[1:16:27] sight to him this morning it would bring
[1:16:29] a
[1:16:30] vision our musicians would come this
[1:16:33] morning even even if a man was naturally
[1:16:36] blind
[1:16:38] yeah he could receive spiritual
[1:16:41] vision there's nobody probably of a
[1:16:44] better example in scripture than Samson
[1:16:46] right oh yeah
[1:16:50] yeah man a good side man with great
[1:16:54] strength he laid his head in the lap of
[1:16:57] Thea too many
[1:16:59] times and gave away his
[1:17:04] secret so what is the secret of the
[1:17:06] church the Holy
[1:17:09] Ghost and every time you lay your head
[1:17:13] in the lap of
[1:17:15] intellectualism it's just
[1:17:17] emotion yeah it's just work
[1:17:20] up why them people uneducated and unco
[1:17:26] shout and
[1:17:28] hollering go lay your head in
[1:17:31] it and after a
[1:17:35] while the Bible said they bind him he'd
[1:17:37] rise up he' break the
[1:17:39] binds but he finally gave that secret
[1:17:44] away that separated that separated to
[1:17:48] God and they shaved it off of him
[1:17:50] brother M said they put out his eyes and
[1:17:52] he stayed that way way and you would
[1:17:54] have thought his purpose was over
[1:17:57] right but brother BR said if you watch
[1:18:00] the story of Samson brother bam tells it
[1:18:02] a lot he's really talking about the
[1:18:04] Pentecostal
[1:18:06] church that's really what he's talking
[1:18:08] about and he says it stands just as big
[1:18:11] and powerful As It Ever Was he said and
[1:18:14] when elij when uh when Samson come out
[1:18:16] that day he said he was the same size he
[1:18:19] always was he had the same arms the same
[1:18:22] fingers the same legs he said he had
[1:18:24] every member there he said but there was
[1:18:27] no strength in his
[1:18:29] members there was no sight in his eyes
[1:18:33] but what he did was is he said Lord
[1:18:36] avenge me these my eyes yeah amen avenge
[1:18:41] me my
[1:18:43] sight God let me be
[1:18:47] Avenged for somebody stripping away my
[1:18:50] ability to see the thing things of
[1:18:54] God can you imagine he was
[1:18:58] captive to the very thing he was built
[1:19:00] up to
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:03] destroy yeah right he was telling them
[1:19:06] Pentecostals you're entering
[1:19:09] organization and you were raised to
[1:19:11] destroy
[1:19:12] it but while he stood there he said take
[1:19:15] me to the to the strongholds of this
[1:19:18] building brother Bram said something was
[1:19:20] going on in that man he began to
[1:19:22] remember remember when God was real to
[1:19:24] him and he said the first thing he done
[1:19:27] is went to it in his
[1:19:29] mind he said then it become a
[1:19:32] reality he felt back brother Bram said
[1:19:35] this brother Tom is a beautiful a
[1:19:36] beautiful story because brother Bram
[1:19:38] says the whole
[1:19:39] time there was something growing
[1:19:43] back and he said if Samson could ever
[1:19:45] reach back there and fill those locks he
[1:19:48] would know that the Covenant was
[1:19:51] restored amen
[1:19:53] now this is powerful brother BR
[1:19:54] preaching you go hear him he does it
[1:19:56] different places and he stops and just
[1:19:58] starts Discerning somebody brother Mike
[1:20:01] he said do you feel the
[1:20:03] locks he starts exercising that gift of
[1:20:06] discernment he said church do you feel
[1:20:09] the
[1:20:11] locks the Covenant is still there
[1:20:14] brother BR said he was standing there as
[1:20:16] a blind man thank you Jesus but he
[1:20:19] caught a
[1:20:21] vision that it was possible to be
[1:20:27] restored he caught the
[1:20:29] vision that a prayer meeting could
[1:20:31] change
[1:20:32] things he caught the
[1:20:35] vision that another Acts 2 was
[1:20:38] possible and when he caught that
[1:20:41] Vision that's when he destroyed the
[1:20:43] works of the enemy and look what he
[1:20:46] did do you think the purpose of God Was
[1:20:51] Defeated God's purpose is never defeated
[1:20:54] amen right if his purpose was to kill
[1:20:57] Philistines Brother David he killed more
[1:20:59] in his death than he did in his
[1:21:02] life if God's purpose was to kill
[1:21:06] Philistines his purpose was greater
[1:21:08] fulfilled that day than it had been in
[1:21:11] his entire life and I'll tell you
[1:21:14] something this morning God can avenge
[1:21:15] your
[1:21:17] eyes God can Avenge the situations and
[1:21:20] maybe you've laid your head in
