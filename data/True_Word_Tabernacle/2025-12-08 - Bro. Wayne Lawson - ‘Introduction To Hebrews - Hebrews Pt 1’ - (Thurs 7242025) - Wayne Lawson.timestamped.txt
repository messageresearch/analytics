[4:15] [music]
[4:16] soul.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't he a real God?
[4:23] [applause]
[4:25] Praise be to God.
[4:28] The Lord Jesus is up from the dead
[4:31] [applause] and he's proven and made
[4:32] himself real among us. We don't have to
[4:35] run and hide like that. Dr. Re had he
[4:37] was explaining there. We have had a
[4:39] vindicated Jesus among us
[4:41] &gt;&gt; and proven to do the same things that he
[4:43] did when he was here on the earth 2,000
[4:45] years ago.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a tremendous hour to
[4:48] serve the Lord. Amen. It's good to be in
[4:50] the house of the Lord tonight. We have
[4:52] some things on our heart and Amen. I
[4:54] just wonder maybe just for a moment
[4:56] before we go into the word. If we could
[4:58] just bow our heart for a word of prayer,
[5:00] let's just speak to the author of the
[5:01] book tonight and ask him for his mercy.
[5:04] Father, we thank you tonight for your
[5:06] word. And truly, Lord, that you have
[5:08] given [music] us this great age to live
[5:10] in. Lord, a prophet that had vision
[5:13] could look across the spans of time.
[5:17] And he said this was the greatest of all
[5:19] the [music] ages to live.
[5:22] And Lord, oh what it must be tonight for
[5:25] us to know the grace that you have shown
[5:28] this gentile dispensation. [music]
[5:30] We ask you tonight Lord that you would
[5:32] enter in the courts of this place Lord
[5:34] as we have prepared and Lord we have
[5:37] done what could be done from our side.
[5:39] But we ask you tonight that [music] you
[5:41] would come in, Lord, and that you would
[5:43] bring these things alive, Lord. That you
[5:45] would give us mercy and understanding,
[5:48] Lord, [music]
[5:49] above all things, Lord. We pray tonight
[5:51] that revelation would strike our hearts
[5:53] as we study your word, Lord. We ask that
[5:56] you would speak to us through it,
[5:58] Father, as we commit these things to
[6:00] you. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[6:02] [music] we pray. Amen and amen. And God
[6:06] bless you tonight. If you have your
[6:08] Bibles, we'd like to go into the book of
[6:09] Hebrews, uh, the first chapter. Hebrews
[6:13] chapter 1,
[6:15] uh, and I'm going to be reading Hebrews
[6:16] 1 and 1 and verse two. Hebrews 1 1 and
[6:19] two. Um, I'm going to, uh, be speaking
[6:22] tonight, Lord willing, uh, from the book
[6:24] of Hebrews. Uh, it's been on me for, uh,
[6:27] last couple years. I've studied through
[6:29] this book speaking different portions,
[6:31] but it's just on my heart to maybe do a
[6:34] little bit more deeper research in the
[6:36] book and just carry it through it. And
[6:38] after listening to brother Brandham uh
[6:40] for a couple times through his series on
[6:42] the Hebrews, it's just more on my heart
[6:44] than ever. Amen. So, we just want to
[6:46] read tonight if we can from Hebrews
[6:48] chapter 1. I'm just going to take the
[6:49] first two verses here. And God who at
[6:53] sunundra times and in diver manners
[6:57] spake in the times past unto the father
[7:00] unto the fathers by the prophets. But he
[7:03] hath in this last day spoken unto us by
[7:07] his son when he hath appointed heir whom
[7:12] he hath appointed heir of all things by
[7:15] whom also he made the worlds. May God
[7:18] bless his word. As you could be seated
[7:20] tonight, I want to speak to you on the
[7:23] the book of Hebrews. This will be a a a
[7:26] first part of a series. This is kind of
[7:28] more of an introduction tonight. Um just
[7:31] listening to the prophet and uh and and
[7:34] some of the things that he spoke on the
[7:35] book of Hebrews. If you've never
[7:36] listened to the series, uh I implore you
[7:39] just to take some time throughout the
[7:41] next month or two or next week or so,
[7:42] however you listen. Uh but start with
[7:45] that Hebrews chapter 1 and just move
[7:47] through that series. It's a beautiful
[7:49] series. You'll learn a lot. It'll it'll
[7:52] really speak to you. Brother Brandham,
[7:53] it just slows way down and just speaks
[7:56] and and goes across the scripture. It's
[7:58] just marvelous to sit and listen to him.
[8:00] Amen. And uh and and and phone that
[8:02] series. I would like to tonight I'm not
[8:04] really I can explain myself in saying
[8:06] this. I'm not really maybe just going
[8:09] through the book uh of what brother
[8:11] Brandham taught. He says the book of
[8:12] Hebrews. There actually is a book called
[8:15] the Hebrews book. We have it in the
[8:16] message. But I'm not really doing so
[8:18] much a deep study on that book as I am
[8:21] the book of the Bible, the book of
[8:22] Hebrews. And then using brother Brandham
[8:25] so that we can go using him uh his uh
[8:28] expository look at that book. But
[8:30] tonight would be maybe more of an
[8:32] introduction into this book. And I I
[8:34] just thought as we were reading it that
[8:36] it would be good uh maybe to look at uh
[8:39] uh at what what it is and and what it
[8:41] does for us and why that it would be
[8:42] important to us as a church. Uh this is
[8:46] a powerful uh first of all I'd say that
[8:48] when you're reading the Bible I think
[8:51] the Bible itself uh if you sometimes I
[8:54] don't know uh if we're always aware of
[8:57] how powerful it is of what we're doing
[8:59] when we read scripture uh of how much it
[9:02] makes a difference in our life and and
[9:04] what what it does in giving us uh power
[9:07] in our hearts. Uh I I think of this in
[9:10] the scriptures uh written within the
[9:12] Bible itself. Uh in 2 Timothy 3 and:e 16
[9:16] the Bible says all scripture is given by
[9:19] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[9:22] doctrine, for reproof, for correction
[9:25] and for instruction in righteousness.
[9:27] That's what the word of God is good for.
[9:29] It is good for doctrine. It is good for
[9:32] reproof and for correction and
[9:33] instruction. Now, the Bible that we read
[9:36] and and we speak from so much and the
[9:38] one you carry has great value. Don't
[9:41] never let anyone take from you the value
[9:44] of the Bible you have. And I know that
[9:46] it's been compiled and been written. Uh
[9:48] there's over 40 different writers.
[9:51] There's over 1,600 years that is
[9:53] covered. And I love how brother Brandham
[9:55] says in Christ revealed in his word. He
[9:56] said it was written by 40 different
[9:58] writers. 40 men wrote the Bible over a
[10:01] space of 1,600 years at different times
[10:04] predicting the most important events
[10:06] that ever happened in world's history.
[10:08] Many times hundreds of years before it
[10:12] ever happens. And there's not an error
[10:14] in the entire 66 books. No author but
[10:18] God himself could be so accurate. Not
[10:20] one word contradicts the other. Now
[10:23] &gt;&gt; you think about the the Bible itself. If
[10:26] you've read read the book of Daniel, you
[10:28] read about historical events where he's
[10:30] he's talking about uh actually the
[10:32] events of people who control the whole
[10:34] world and and and like you're talking
[10:36] about the Greeks and you're talking
[10:37] about the Mes and Persians and there's
[10:39] actually people that believe that Daniel
[10:41] wrote the book post all of those er that
[10:45] era because it's so exactly precise in
[10:48] its reading that they can't believe that
[10:50] a man could predict it so so so
[10:52] wonderfully before it ever happened.
[10:54] See, but God actually knows all things
[10:56] and he knows the end from the beginning.
[10:59] And he can tell you about tomorrow like
[11:01] it was yesterday because he knows it
[11:03] before it happens. Now remember this
[11:05] Bible was written by them. Uh brother
[11:08] man actually compares it. He said you
[11:10] take 66 medical books that deals with
[11:12] the body and get 40 different medical
[11:15] schools and get them over a 1600 year
[11:18] period and see what kind of continuity
[11:20] you'd come up with there. I'll tell you
[11:22] what. Yeah. Y'all know, amen. Even since
[11:24] uh the Second World War when the the
[11:26] when the Nazis done so much experiments
[11:28] on the Jews, God God help them. Amen.
[11:31] But look at the change in in modern
[11:33] science and look at the the increase of
[11:35] medical science and even uh lately we
[11:38] had the CO in in the in the 20s 20s.
[11:40] Remember how when they first started
[11:41] treating it, they was writing articles,
[11:43] this is the way you got to do it, the
[11:44] way you got to do it. And by the time it
[11:46] was over, they found out they wasn't
[11:47] doing it right on many cases because
[11:50] because uh you know, you get five
[11:52] different men, you get five different
[11:53] opinions, you get a hundred men, you get
[11:56] a hundred opinions. Amen. And and you
[11:58] find out that there is so many different
[12:00] opinions. It there's there's not any uh
[12:02] books that are written over a large scan
[12:05] of time that that's going to uh uh
[12:08] complement one with the other. They're
[12:10] going to contradict. But the Bible is
[12:12] actually the only book that has the same
[12:14] author. Amen. Throughout the entire
[12:16] Bible. So it might have been 40
[12:18] different writers. But the God of heaven
[12:20] is the author of the Bible. It is
[12:22] breathed out by God. Now in Christ
[12:24] revealed in the word, the B prophet said
[12:26] it like this. Not one word of the Bible
[12:28] contradicts the other and not one
[12:30] prophet ever contradicted the other. He
[12:32] says there everyone perfect. And when
[12:34] they one come and did prophesy, it was a
[12:37] real prophet raised up and called down.
[12:39] that it was made manifest. See, so the
[12:41] Bible is the word of God to the true
[12:45] believer.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible is the word of God to the
[12:49] believer. Now, in in in the scripture,
[12:51] Jesus said in Matthew 5, he said, "For
[12:53] verily I say unto you, till heaven and
[12:56] earth pass, one jot or one tit and no
[12:58] wise will pass from the law till it all
[13:01] be fulfilled." So, heavens and earth
[13:03] could fail, but not the word of God.
[13:05] Excuse me. In Matthew 24 and35, Jesus
[13:09] said, "Heavens and earth shall pass
[13:10] away, but my word shall not pass away."
[13:14] Amen. In Numbers 23:19, he said, "God is
[13:18] not a man that he should lie, neither
[13:20] the son of man that he should repent. He
[13:22] has said and shall not do it or hath
[13:24] spoken and he shall not make it good."
[13:27] In Psalms 19:7, the law of the Lord is
[13:30] perfect as for the converting of the
[13:31] soul, and the testimony of the Lord is
[13:34] sure, making wise the simple. In Psalms
[13:37] 89 and 34, for my covenant I will not
[13:39] break, nor alter the thing which is gone
[13:42] out of my lips. In Psalms in Proverbs 30
[13:45] and5, for every word of God is pure. He
[13:49] is a shield unto them that put their
[13:51] trust in him. In Isaiah 40 and8, the
[13:54] grass witherth and the flower fadeth,
[13:56] but the word of God it standeth forever.
[13:59] In Isaiah 55 and 111, so shall my word
[14:03] be goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall
[14:05] not return unto me void, but it shall
[14:08] accomplish that what I please, and it
[14:10] shall prosper where unto the thing I
[14:13] sent it. in Titus 1 and2 in the hope of
[14:16] eternal life which God that cannot lie
[14:19] promised before the world began. Now I'm
[14:22] going to touch the book of Hebrews here
[14:24] for a moment in the sixth chapter. NOW
[14:26] WHEN GOD MADE promises to Abraham
[14:28] because he could swear by none greater
[14:31] he swore by himself saying surely bless
[14:33] and I will bless and multiply and I will
[14:36] multiply. And so after he had patiently
[14:38] endured, he obtained the promise. For
[14:41] men verilely swear by the greater, and
[14:43] an oath of confirmation is to them the
[14:45] end of all strife. Wherein God more
[14:48] willing abundantly to show unto the
[14:50] heirs a promise, that's us, the
[14:52] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[14:55] by an oath that by two immutable things.
[14:58] By two immutable things. How many knows
[15:00] what it means? Two immutable things.
[15:03] Immutable means, Amen. unchangeable. In
[15:05] other words, the prophet said there's
[15:07] two immutables here. He said he is God
[15:10] that can't lie. And number two, he gives
[15:13] a promise. So there's two things here.
[15:15] The God that can't lie has gave you a
[15:18] promise. And somebody can promise you
[15:20] anything. Amen. And that's good to get a
[15:22] promise. But if somebody can't lie and
[15:24] then they make a promise, brother, you
[15:26] got assurityity then. And the Bible said
[15:28] that they would have a strong
[15:30] consolation. Now in 1 Peter chapter 1
[15:32] and verse 24, for all the flesh is
[15:35] grass, and all the glory of man as the
[15:37] flower of grass, the grass witherth, and
[15:40] the flower therefore fadeth, but the
[15:43] word of the Lord endureth forever. And
[15:46] this is the word by which the gospel is
[15:49] preached unto you. In Revelations 3
[15:52] and:14, "And unto the angel of the
[15:54] church of Leodysans, these things saith
[15:56] the amen, THE FAITHFUL and the true
[15:59] witness, the beginning of the creation
[16:02] of God." Now, I've just took a few of
[16:04] the scriptures from the Bible that
[16:06] declare unto us that if we believe the
[16:09] Bible is the word of God, and I do
[16:11] believe that. And I I believe that every
[16:13] true Christian must believe that the
[16:16] Bible is the word of God. And if it is
[16:18] THE WORD OF GOD, then it is unfailing.
[16:21] It is inherent. It is unccorruptible.
[16:23] Amen. It is the word that endureth
[16:26] forever. Amen. Is that right? AMEN. NOW,
[16:29] THE PROPHET has something beautiful to
[16:30] say in the message. Why? He said, "I
[16:32] just love this old blessed Bible. I
[16:35] think it is the grandest thing. I think
[16:37] that it is God. It is God in letter
[16:40] form."
[16:42] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. Christ revealed in
[16:44] his old word. It's the Old Testament
[16:46] alone. It's more than 2,000 times those
[16:50] prophets had said, "Thus saith the
[16:52] Lord." Over 500 times just in the first
[16:54] four books of the Bible. Amen. WITH
[16:56] MOSES, BROTHER RAM SAID, "These men
[16:58] being prophets, it's not me. I have
[17:01] nothing to do with it. It's thus saith
[17:03] the Lord. So the Bible is thus saith the
[17:06] Lord by the prophets. My goodness. No
[17:09] wonder Paul begins his letter to the
[17:12] Hebrews by saying to them, God who at
[17:15] sundried times end man. It didn't say
[17:17] man in sundry times and diverse manners.
[17:20] He said God in sundry times and diverse
[17:23] manners. WHO WAS IT SPEAKING throughout
[17:26] the ages? IT WAS GOD. IT wasn't It
[17:29] wasn't prophets. It wasn't mortals. I'm
[17:31] quoting. He says it was God in Sundra
[17:34] times. Now, now you we look tonight and
[17:37] and we read the book of Hebrews. And as
[17:39] we read it, Amen. There's many
[17:40] theologian tonight that don't know for
[17:42] sure who wrote the Bible. There's uh the
[17:44] book of of Hebrews. There's a lot of
[17:46] people who are who are uh wondering who
[17:48] wrote the book. Amen. But but you know,
[17:50] Brother Bram comes back and says, "But
[17:53] if you got any spiritual discernment,
[17:54] you would know it was Paul that wrote
[17:56] it." Amen. But you know, it's a funny
[17:58] thing. The reason a lot of people, a lot
[18:00] of the theologians don't want to believe
[18:01] that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews
[18:03] because they said Paul believes in
[18:05] eternal security and teaches it in
[18:07] Ephesians and Romans, but in the book of
[18:09] Hebrews, the sixth chapter, it sounds
[18:11] like a man could lose his salvation. So,
[18:13] they didn't want to contribute the book
[18:15] of Hebrews to Paul because of that. But
[18:17] you know what I found out? Amen. If you
[18:19] know how to read Hebrews 6, it has
[18:22] nothing to do with a man losing his
[18:23] salvation. BUT IT'S EVERYTHING to do
[18:26] meaning that when man receives
[18:27] salvation, he receives eternal
[18:30] salvation. AND IF GOD GIVE YOU
[18:32] SALVATION, HE GAVE YOU ETERNAL
[18:35] SALVATION. HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU SALVATION.
[18:37] You gain and lose. HE GIVES YOU ETERNAL
[18:40] SALVATION. HE'S AN ETERNAL GOD WITH
[18:43] ETERNAL REDEMPTION AND RETURN SALVATION.
[18:46] And the one that wrote that book of
[18:48] Hebrews was Paul. But brother Bram said,
[18:51] "Not really Paul." He says, "Because we
[18:53] just said God wrote it." He said, "In
[18:55] some it says,"Well, you said Paul wrote
[18:57] it." He said, "Really? Not Paul." BUT IT
[18:59] WAS GOD that was in Paul. It was the
[19:02] creative being inside Paul.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Who wrote the book of
[19:08] Hebrews? The creative being that was
[19:11] inside of Paul. My what a what a
[19:14] powerful thing that the creative being
[19:16] of God COULD GET IN A MAN, PUT PEN UPON
[19:19] a paper, and 2,000 years later, we would
[19:22] be reading IT BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD IS
[19:25] GOOD TO ALL people at all times and of
[19:27] all ages. If I wrote a letter to you,
[19:30] buddy, that would be good for me and
[19:32] you. That's all that letter would ever
[19:33] be good for. But when God writes a
[19:36] letter, that letter is good for all men
[19:38] at all time, for all ages. BECAUSE WHEN
[19:41] THE SPIRIT OF GOD GETS ON HIS WORD, it
[19:44] makes it alive.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later, the prophet speaking
[19:48] of the book of Hebrews, beautiful things
[19:50] he would have to say about it. He said,
[19:52] "We're studying the book of Hebrews, and
[19:54] it is one of the deepest, richest books
[19:57] that is in the Bible.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; The deepest richest books that's in the
[20:02] Bible." Amen. Brother Bam says it like
[20:04] this. In law having a shadow, the book
[20:05] of Hebrews was to the Jews. Amen. And it
[20:09] was for the separating of law from
[20:11] grace. The book of Hebrews is to the Jew
[20:14] and it was for the separating of law and
[20:16] grace. Have you ever thought about I
[20:18] just thought about this week. Have you
[20:19] ever thought about the Jews receiving
[20:21] the book of Hebrews in their time? But
[20:24] honestly, they will be reading the book
[20:26] of Hebrews in the tribulation.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? THAT WHAT
[20:30] WHAT BOOK WILL they read in the
[20:32] tribulation period? What would they be
[20:33] studying? what they they're going TO
[20:35] READ THE SAME BIBLE THAT YOU'RE READING
[20:37] TONIGHT. They'll be reading that over in
[20:39] the tribulation period and they'll read
[20:41] this same book of Hebrews and realize
[20:44] amen through prophetic uh uh course of
[20:46] course but God will steer them back to
[20:48] the things that Paul taught in the book
[20:50] of Hebrews when he was there because it
[20:52] was Hebrews to the Jews and it is
[20:54] separating law from grace. Amen. Now,
[20:57] brother Ram said there had been many
[20:58] disputes in the church of whether they
[21:00] should eat meat or whether they should
[21:02] associate with Gentiles. And I think
[21:04] Paul was writing this epistles to them.
[21:07] Hebrews is one of the most outstanding
[21:09] letters in the book.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; And to me, it's great because it's
[21:13] showing the law and grace and it's
[21:16] separating the two.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; And look what he done it again. It's
[21:20] separating the two. In Hebrews chapter
[21:22] 1, brother Bam said, "And he's had all
[21:24] of his experiences. But first, the
[21:26] experience was proven." And this is the
[21:29] key letter. This is his key letter. He
[21:32] calls the book of Hebrews Paul's key
[21:34] letter. It's the richest, deepest book
[21:37] of the Bible. It is a key letter. Amen.
[21:40] And it is one of the most outstanding
[21:41] letter. That's what the prophet has to
[21:43] say about the book of Hebrews. So, I I
[21:45] want to take more than just a casual
[21:47] look at it as we study it because it is
[21:49] rich and is deep and it has something
[21:51] for the church of the living God.
[21:53] Brother Bam said, "I believe with a
[21:54] little spiritual discernment, we would
[21:56] see that St. Paul wrote this book." And
[21:58] and tonight you're sitting here and and
[22:00] you know, I just appreciate a a prophet.
[22:02] Don't you? Because theologians uh can't
[22:05] come to this reality tonight. They can't
[22:07] just say, "Well, Paul wrote it." Because
[22:09] they can't they can't nail it down. But
[22:11] you and I under vindicated prophet, we
[22:14] can just take his word for it. Paul
[22:15] wrote it.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul wrote it. AND PAUL, AMEN,
[22:19] was a great Bible teacher. How many
[22:21] realize is Paul was an Old Testament
[22:23] Bible scholar?
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul was an Old Testament Bible
[22:27] scholar. And brother Ramon says, "See
[22:28] that's what we learned. He said under
[22:30] that great teacher, one of the greatest
[22:33] of his days of Galia. He was versed in
[22:36] the Old Testament. He knew it well. He
[22:38] was a persecutor of the way of Christ's
[22:40] ways. He had been trained in the Old
[22:42] Testament under teachers, but the
[22:44] teachers are usually carnal. I I hope I
[22:46] don't say anything wrong, but usually if
[22:48] a man is just teaching the ways of his
[22:50] schools, it's usually man-made. It isn't
[22:53] inspired. But because it becomes a
[22:55] doctrine of a school, we have it today.
[22:58] Presbyterians and Lutheran and
[22:59] Pentecostals, and they have their
[23:01] schools of theory, and they just wind
[23:03] the scriptures into it. See, but let me
[23:06] just break right there and say this.
[23:07] Paul was taught of Galia. You know your
[23:10] Bible says that, right? It says in Acts
[23:12] 22 and verse three, I'm verily a man
[23:15] which am a Jew. I was born in Tarsus in
[23:18] a city of Cecilia, yet brought up in the
[23:21] city at the feet of Galia,
[23:25] &gt;&gt; and taught according to perfect manner
[23:27] of the law of the fathers, and was
[23:28] zealous towards God as you all are this
[23:31] day." Now Paul is speaking Hebrew unto
[23:33] them at the temple and they're amazed
[23:35] that this Roman is speaking Hebrew. But
[23:38] he starts to tell them, "Hey, look, I'm
[23:39] much Hebrew as you are Hebrew." Amen.
[23:42] And I was taught the law by the greatest
[23:44] teacher y'all got, Galia. And he was
[23:46] explaining this to him. Now, if you look
[23:48] in Acts chapter 5 and verse 34, Amen.
[23:51] It's told in the book of Acts, amen,
[23:53] that Galia was more than just an average
[23:55] teacher. The Bible said he is named
[23:57] Gabelia a doctor of the law. And he had
[24:01] a reputation among all people. So if you
[24:03] wanted to know something about the Old
[24:05] Testament, Galia was the go-to guy. HE
[24:08] WAS THE GUY THAT EVERYBODY would have
[24:10] wanted to set under as a teacher. AND
[24:12] PAUL WAS SITTING under him. Now you know
[24:14] him famous if you know he said it or
[24:16] not, but he's famous for this saying.
[24:18] Amen. That when they were trying to come
[24:20] against the disciples, it was Galia that
[24:22] told him, "Look now, leave these people
[24:24] alone." He says, "IF IF IT BE OF GOD,
[24:27] you cannot overthrow it." He says, "But
[24:29] if it if it be of if it be uh God," he
[24:32] said, "then you being found fighting
[24:34] against God." How many ever heard
[24:35] somebody quote that and say, "Well, if
[24:37] they're doing something," Amen. You just
[24:39] let them alone. If it ain't the Lord,
[24:41] it'll fizzle out. But if it is the Lord,
[24:43] you don't want to fight against THE
[24:44] LORD. AMEN. HE WAS A VERY WISE MAN. AND
[24:47] THIS MAN PAUL HAD STAYED UNDER. SEE,
[24:49] PAUL WAS WELL TRAINED in the scriptures
[24:52] by the word. And you see the scriptures,
[24:54] no matter how well you know them, if the
[24:58] spirit doesn't quicken them, then the
[25:00] letter it killth. See, the spirit gives
[25:02] life. IT MUST BE QUICKENED or made alive
[25:05] by the spirit. If the spirit doesn't
[25:08] liven the word and make it a reality to
[25:11] you, then this letter is just
[25:13] intellectual.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; It is just intellectual. I'll give you
[25:17] the scripture 2 Corinthians 3 and verse
[25:19] 6. Paul, Paul of all men knew this to be
[25:23] the truth. Who also have made us able
[25:26] ministers of the New Testament, not of
[25:29] the letter, but of the spirit. For the
[25:31] letter kleth, but the spirit giveth
[25:34] life. Look, under the teachings of
[25:35] Galia. PAUL WAS KILLING CHRISTIANS UNDER
[25:39] THE TEACHINGS of Galia. He knew the law
[25:42] better than anybody knew the law. AMEN.
[25:44] AND PAUL, NO. NOW, NOW NO DOUBT PAUL WAS
[25:48] AT THE FEET OF GALIA learning the law
[25:50] and listening TO THE PHARISEES THAT PUT
[25:53] JESUS CHRIST ON THE CROSS. YOU KNOW,
[25:56] PAUL WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE TEMPLE
[25:58] listening and conversing and being
[26:00] taught while Jesus was walking the
[26:02] street. BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IN THE LETTER
[26:04] OF THE LAW THAT WHEN THE LAW AMEN BECOME
[26:08] ALIVE IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF
[26:10] GOD, HE WAS QUOTING THE LAW TO THE
[26:13] SPIRIT OF THE ONE THAT WROTE THE LAW.
[26:16] THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LETTER WAS
[26:18] STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM. BUT WITHOUT
[26:20] THE QUICKENING SPIRIT OF GOD, YOU WILL
[26:22] CRUCIFY THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF
[26:25] ALMIGHTY GOD. I SAY GOD, WE DON'T JUST
[26:27] NEED TEACHERS TONIGHT. WE NEED A
[26:29] QUICKENING POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST TO
[26:32] MAKE THIS LETTER ALIVE IN THE HEART OF
[26:35] THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. NOW
[26:37] LISTEN, I I I CERTAINLY know that we
[26:39] need it. Now, the beauty of this letter
[26:41] to me is Paul was a very learned man of
[26:43] the testament. And I certainly believe
[26:45] the Bible said that a man ought to study
[26:47] to show himself approved. DON'T Y'ALL? I
[26:50] DON'T believe the Bible says it clearly.
[26:51] He says, he says, "The truth shall set
[26:53] you free." You know what truth sets you
[26:55] free? The truth, you know, set you free.
[26:58] I'm not just one of them guys that say,
[26:59] "Well, let's just live life and get up
[27:01] and say what comes to our mind and
[27:03] whatever." How do you know what's coming
[27:05] TO YOUR MIND'S GOD or not? AMEN. UNLESS
[27:07] YOU FILTER IT BY the word of God. HOW DO
[27:09] YOU KNOW WHAT'S DEALING WITH YOU? AMEN.
[27:12] THE PROPHET SAID THE SPIRITS WILL BE THE
[27:14] SAME. HE SAID THE SPIRIT OF THE DEVIL
[27:16] CAN MANIFEST the same as THE SPIRIT OF
[27:18] CHRIST. HE SAID, "BUT THE WORD IS HOW
[27:21] YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. SO
[27:22] IF THERE'S NO WORD, THEN YOU'LL FOLLOW
[27:25] ANY SPIRIT. BUT IF IT'S JUST WORD AND
[27:28] THERE'S NO ANOINTING, THEN YOU CAN that
[27:30] you could literally crucify the
[27:32] manifestation of God and use the word to
[27:35] do it.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But watch here. Spirit must live.
[27:38] And Paul of all men knew that.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Paul of all men knew you can learn the
[27:44] law and crucify the God of the Bible.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Now Paul in the Hebrews is separating
[27:50] law and grace. Now, that's a very
[27:52] powerful thing that he could separate
[27:55] the two and he could show a change. Now,
[27:57] the book of Hebrews is going to be
[27:59] showing a change in the priesthood. Now,
[28:01] this is the this is one of the greatest
[28:03] books in the Bible because what he's
[28:05] doing is he's showing these Hebrews,
[28:08] these Jews, this priesthood that you
[28:10] have have leaned upon for your offerings
[28:13] and for your sin offering and and for
[28:15] your approach to God. Amen. these these
[28:18] Levites that you're following. Amen.
[28:21] It's coming to an end and there is a new
[28:24] priesthood that is superior to this old
[28:26] priesthood.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Now, that's hard for them to understand.
[28:30] But but if you watch you watch Levi,
[28:32] okay, Levi was in the loins of Abraham
[28:34] when he paid tithe to who?
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Melchazdc. Now, we'll get into it later,
[28:38] but let's just take the introduction.
[28:40] Levi was in the loins of Abraham when he
[28:43] paid tithe under Melchazdc which the
[28:45] Bible tells us was which was greater
[28:48] that he paid tithe to him. This man that
[28:50] Levi would that Abraham would pay tithe
[28:52] to so then later when God calls the
[28:55] priesthood where's he call him from the
[28:57] tribe of Levi.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; So the herionic priesthood it was a
[29:01] Levitical priesthood which come out
[29:03] because that Abraham had met Mount
[29:06] Mazdc. So that's how they were to be.
[29:08] But according to scriptures, amen, there
[29:10] was to come a superior priest, right?
[29:13] &gt;&gt; But but you recognize that THAT THAT
[29:16] SAME PRIEST WAS SUPPOSED TO be a
[29:18] Messiah, which would be a king.
[29:20] According to Psalms, David David
[29:22] testifies and said, he said, "Thou my
[29:24] thou art my son, and forever thou shalt
[29:26] be after priest, after the order of
[29:27] Melchazdc." But it was the same one that
[29:30] made David the promise. His son would be
[29:32] a priest also made a promise that his
[29:35] son would rule on the throne of
[29:37] Jerusalem throughout eternity. So there
[29:39] was a kingly there's a kingly promise
[29:41] that the Messiah would be king. Jesus
[29:43] was said to he was coming king. Okay?
[29:47] And he also prophesies he's going to be
[29:49] a priest. So he would have had to come
[29:51] out of Levi for one tribe and he would
[29:54] had to come out of Judah FOR A KING. SO,
[29:56] HOW YOU GOING TO GET BOTH of them
[29:57] together unless you come after THE ORDER
[30:00] OF MELCHAZDC? AND AND PAUL IS TRYING TO
[30:03] DESCRIBE TO THEM, WE'RE A CHANGING
[30:05] priesthood that is superior to THE
[30:08] PRIESTHOOD YOU GOT NOW. HE HAS HIS OWN
[30:10] COVENANT. HE HAS HIS OWN BLOOD. HE HAS
[30:12] HIS OWN PRIESTHOOD. AND IT'S ALL
[30:15] SUPERIOR. AMEN. AND HE IS NOW fulfilling
[30:17] the law and bringing you under the real
[30:19] grace of God. Paul is separating this
[30:22] and he's introducing Jesus Christ as the
[30:25] priest. The Can you imagine?
[30:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; TO THESE JEWS, HE'S A HERETIC. HE'S A
[30:31] HE'S A HE'S A WINE BIBBER. HE'S A BE
[30:33] ELABUB. HE HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED BY OUR
[30:36] CHURCHES AND AND HE'S BEEN RULED OUT.
[30:39] AND PAUL is writing them a letter to
[30:41] tell them he took the place of your
[30:43] priest.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; HE HAS DISENEDLED your law. HE HAS
[30:47] DISOWNED YOUR PRIEST. AND UNLESS YOU
[30:49] COME under the order of Jesus Christ,
[30:51] you'll have no sacrifice for your sins.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He changed it. Do you see? Now, he
[30:58] changed he changed the law and he
[31:01] changed the priesthood. But there's
[31:03] something the Old Testament priest had,
[31:05] wasn't it? Brother Bam talks a lot about
[31:06] it. We'll get maybe get into it later,
[31:08] but right now I want to just put it as a
[31:09] thought. He gets a lot into this that
[31:11] the Old Testament when someone had a
[31:13] dream or a prophecy, you remember
[31:14] brother Bam said they had a ura of
[31:16] thumbum
[31:17] &gt;&gt; and that belonged to the law they would
[31:19] tell it before the euroma of thumb and
[31:20] it would flash lights and it would say
[31:22] it was from God or it wasn't from God.
[31:24] And brother Bam said now notice the
[31:26] Levitical law had been done away with.
[31:29] The priesthood is done away with he said
[31:31] but the uromothum had not been done away
[31:34] with but the new uromathum WAS THE WORD.
[31:38] YEAH.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; SO PAUL knowing the old law is going to
[31:43] comb through the Bible to preach this
[31:46] reality to you from the Old Testament. I
[31:49] I just love how Paul how Paul had a
[31:52] revelation. Now look folks, I I don't
[31:56] know how to stress the importance of
[31:57] revelation. I I wish we could just take
[31:59] a brother Ray. Amen. you if if if you
[32:04] could get brother Ray to tell you the
[32:06] sum of his life and what is the most
[32:08] important thing for a Christian, brother
[32:09] Ray, he'd tell you it's revelation.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; The most important thing for any
[32:13] believer is revelation. You know,
[32:15] brother Ram said it's the most
[32:16] prevailing power.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Ram said you ought
[32:18] to pray for revelation more than
[32:21] anything else.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Amen. Revelation is
[32:26] the thing that will conquer the devil.
[32:28] Yeah.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Look, when revelation COMES, I I I I
[32:31] I'LL show you sometimes situations don't
[32:34] change. IT IT AIN'T NO DIFFERENT.
[32:35] SITUATIONS don't change. I've often
[32:37] thought about Moses. Moses went to the
[32:39] burning bush. He took a revelation from
[32:40] God. And when he got that revelation,
[32:42] it's amazing to me. Egypt hadn't
[32:44] changed. His wife hadn't changed. The
[32:47] situation HADN'T CHANGED. THE DES
[32:49] NOTHING CHANGED.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; But Moses changed.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; And a MAN WITH A REVELATION CONQUERED
[32:56] EGYPT. AND THE BIBLE SAID BY FAITH HE
[32:58] SUBDUED KINGDOMS. AND FAITH IS A
[33:01] revelation of the will of God. AMEN. AND
[33:04] PAUL NEEDED REVELATION. He had teaching.
[33:07] HE HAD UNDERSTANDING. HE HAD GREAT
[33:09] WISDOM. BUT HE HAD TO HAVE REVELATION
[33:12] THAT THE MAZDC HE WAS READING ABOUT WAS
[33:15] JESUS CHRIST,
[33:17] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD. Oh my goodness. If you
[33:20] ever catch that revelation, he liveth
[33:23] and abideth forever.
[33:25] My goodness. The revelation, the thing,
[33:28] his revelation was so great. Amen. The
[33:31] pro brother said it like this. Paul had
[33:33] a revelation of who he was and the thing
[33:35] he seen. His revelation was so great he
[33:38] let him write the Bible like Moses in
[33:40] the Old Testament. Great men. Paul had
[33:42] revelation and knew that Jesus of the
[33:45] New Testament was Jehovah of the Old
[33:48] Testament.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Now look for I I it doesn't matter to
[33:53] me. Amen. How you divide things up. When
[33:56] you get done, you're going to have to
[33:58] remember this. Jesus of the new is
[34:00] Jehovah of the old.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Now, there's been some Godhead teachers
[34:04] that got that all messed up.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; And they can't figure out if Jesus was
[34:08] deity or if he's Jehovah something
[34:10] separate than Jesus. And they got all
[34:12] kinds of messed up. And and and people
[34:14] say to brother Brandham said, "Brother
[34:15] Brandham, how do you get that straight?"
[34:16] He said, "Well, let me say what you do.
[34:18] You forget what people say and you focus
[34:21] on the word of God and it'll come one to
[34:23] you
[34:25] &gt;&gt; cuz the word of God puts them as one. Do
[34:27] you see? You remember some of you
[34:29] hunters in here, you probably heard
[34:30] brother Bam talk about it that somebody
[34:32] told Brother Bam, they said, "Brother
[34:33] Bam, take these binoculars here and look
[34:35] out there in the field and look at that
[34:36] analopee." And he said, "There were just
[34:38] one lone analopee out there." He said,
[34:39] "When I throw them binoculars up," he
[34:41] said, "I could see two or three." He
[34:43] said, "But being that I knew there was
[34:45] one out there, only one," he said, "I
[34:47] just kept focusing them binoculars until
[34:50] it just showed one." Do you see what
[34:52] that'll do if you IF YOU SOMEBODY TELLS
[34:54] YOU, "AMEN." If I'm sitting here tonight
[34:56] and I'm saying there's just one God, and
[34:58] then you start trying to look through
[35:00] the idea of teachers at that one God,
[35:03] they'll separate that, make three out of
[35:05] that, or they'll make two out of that.
[35:07] But I'm telling you, there's just one.
[35:10] SO KEEP FOCUSING UNTIL the revelation
[35:12] STRIKES YOUR HEART. THAT NO MATTER HOW
[35:15] MANY YOU THINK YOU SEE, THERE'S JUST ONE
[35:17] GOD THERE.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN YOU LET INTELLECT GO AND YOU
[35:22] LET REVELATION CONTROL YOUR THOUGHTS AND
[35:24] KNOW THAT JESUS IS GOD.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He is deity.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. And anybody that would
[35:33] would would question that, I just ask
[35:35] you to do me a word search one time on
[35:38] the word deity. That's all I ask you to
[35:40] do.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see Old Testament. Amen.
[35:44] We finding out that God has been veiled
[35:48] and and God is speaking through men. God
[35:52] is speaking through men to give it. Now,
[35:55] if you're if you're studying this,
[35:57] brother Bam is going to liken Paul a lot
[36:00] unto Moses.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[36:02] &gt;&gt; it's a beautiful revelation when you
[36:04] start seeing the correlation between
[36:05] Paul and Moses. Now, I want to do
[36:07] something in that. I want to talk about
[36:09] the hebrews book as it was then to those
[36:12] Jews. So, you can see what it is now to
[36:14] us in this age.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; But until you see the importance of it
[36:18] to the Jew, you'll never understand the
[36:20] importance to us. Now in Numbers chapter
[36:23] 12, I think it's amazing here. If you're
[36:25] in the Old Testament, let's look in the
[36:27] sixth verse. He said, "Hear now my
[36:29] words, if there be a prophet among you,
[36:31] I the Lord will make myself known unto
[36:33] him in vision, will speak unto him in
[36:35] dream. My servant Moses is not so who is
[36:39] faithful in all of my house." Now, this
[36:41] will come up later in the Hebrew book.
[36:42] Faithful in all the house. Amen. But
[36:44] look what he says. A prophet, watch the
[36:46] verse six. A prophet, I'll make myself
[36:48] known in visions and dreams. But Moses
[36:51] is different.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; He's making a point. There's going to be
[36:54] visions and dreams. You're going to see
[36:56] people have visions and dreams. But
[36:58] Moses is going to be different. He said,
[37:00] "With him, I speak mouthto mouth. Even
[37:03] apparently and not in the dark speeches
[37:06] and the similitude of the Lord shall he
[37:08] behold. Wherefore were you not afraid to
[37:11] speak against my servant Moses?" And
[37:13] this is when Miriam and Aaron had had
[37:15] had laughed at him over his marriage.
[37:18] And they were arguing with brother
[37:19] Brandham over biracial marriage.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Bad idea. Don't argue with
[37:25] the prophet over anything. He's not a
[37:27] normal prophet. Okay?
[37:29] &gt;&gt; It's just not. If Brother Ram says
[37:31] something, just just just go on with it,
[37:33] you know. Don't just obey the voice of
[37:35] the angel.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he was different. Now, he was
[37:38] different than normal. See, watch watch
[37:39] here in paragraph 171. Brother Bam says
[37:42] he was different. His message was
[37:44] different. He was different from priest.
[37:46] He was different from anything. See, he
[37:48] was a different person. Now, the people
[37:50] had seen something had happened. And God
[37:53] had veiled himself in his prophet to
[37:56] speak his words to them. That's what he
[37:59] had done. Moses was that living word of
[38:02] God to the people. And he veiled by that
[38:05] pillar of fire speaking what was to be
[38:08] veiled later behind badger skins. Look,
[38:10] the words that Moses was going to speak
[38:14] was going to go in THEIR HOLY PLACE. CAN
[38:16] YOU IMAGINE? A MAN COULD SPEAK WORDS. HE
[38:19] COULD SPEAK WORDS THAT WOULD BE PLACED
[38:22] BEHIND THAT BADGER SKIN THAT MAN
[38:24] COULDN'T even look TO THE PLACE WHERE
[38:26] THEY WAS WRITTEN. THEY WERE SO POWERFUL.
[38:28] This man was not JUST ANOTHER PROPHET.
[38:31] AMEN. HE WAS A GOD PROPHET. HE WAS A
[38:33] VINDICATED PROPHET. Look what he says
[38:36] here in the unveiling. And brother Bam
[38:37] said the word come uh uh uh come from
[38:40] Moses first. See, Moses had the word.
[38:42] They were written by God. Nobody could
[38:44] interpret them. Moses had to interpret
[38:46] first. That's the reason he veiled his
[38:48] face. Do you see it? Here it is. See, WE
[38:51] COULD PICK IT AND PACK it up and
[38:53] everything else, but it's got to be
[38:55] revealed. In order to be revealed, Moses
[38:57] had to become God to the people.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Yeah.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Before it could become what it was meant
[39:07] to be, Moses had to become God to the
[39:11] people.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a powerful reality.
[39:14] You say that's nonsense. HE SAID EVEN HE
[39:17] TOLD MOSES HIMSELF, YOU'LL BE A god and
[39:21] Aaron will be YOUR PROPHET. SO THERE HE
[39:23] COME. He had a veil to HIMSELF CUZ GOD
[39:26] is always behind the veil. Somebody say
[39:28] behind the veil.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; He was behind the veil of Moses. BUT
[39:32] WHEN MOSES SPOKE THOSE WORDS, those
[39:35] words were God.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THEM WORDS WENT BEHIND THE
[39:39] VEIL. MOSES WASN'T GOD. BUT GOD MADE HIM
[39:42] GOD TO SPEAK HIS WORD. AND HIS WORD HAD
[39:45] TO BECOME VEILED. THEY NEVER WENT AND
[39:47] WORSHIPED MOSES. THEY NEVER MADE
[39:49] OFFERINGS TO MOSES. BUT THE THINGS THAT
[39:52] HE SPOKE,
[39:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE THINGS THAT HE SPOKE
[39:56] BECOME THE PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR THE
[39:59] BELIEVER.
[40:01] My goodness.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; No wonder what a prophet Moses was. Do
[40:06] you see the authority that he came
[40:08] under? Amen. Amen. Now, years ago, I
[40:11] preached a sermon. If you remember it,
[40:12] it was called the Elohim Revelation. How
[40:14] many remembers the sermon? And if you
[40:16] don't remember the sermon, that means
[40:18] I've got a brand new sermon I preach on
[40:19] Sunday.
[40:22] Elohim Revelation. Amen. Now, let me
[40:24] just say what what that means. In the
[40:27] beginning, God created. The word God is
[40:29] Elohim.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Meaning self-existent one. Correct? All
[40:32] right. Now, that's the one that Moses
[40:35] wrote about in the Bible. And the one he
[40:39] met in the burning bush. Do you all know
[40:41] this Bible that you're reading? The
[40:43] first five books of this Bible. Amen.
[40:45] It's actually the writings of Moses.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, do y'all know that's where
[40:50] Christians, Jews, and Muslims all agree?
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:54] You Christian, Jews, and Muslims all
[40:56] agree on the first few books of this
[40:58] Bible. And Moses wrote those books,
[41:01] amen, of the Old Testament, amen, and he
[41:03] wrote them. Now, brother Bham said, now
[41:04] remember this. Remember, he had no Bible
[41:07] to READ FROM. MOSES HAD NO BIBLE to read
[41:10] from. He didn't have it as easy as we
[41:12] have it today.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; He couldn't read his words as others
[41:16] took it. Remember, he only had it by
[41:18] revelation. That's the same way it was
[41:20] Joseph in the Genesis. There was no
[41:22] Bible. Remember Moses wrote Genesis,
[41:24] Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy. None of
[41:26] those characters had Bibles until Moses.
[41:29] See, they didn't have a Bible. Amen.
[41:31] Now, what he's what he's telling you is
[41:33] is Moses is the author of the Bible you
[41:36] read. SO, WE CALL THEM AMEN. NOW, I know
[41:39] people get funny about quoting quoting
[41:41] men of God and things. Amen. And they
[41:43] call, you know, you you you better be
[41:45] careful, but let me just, you know, you
[41:47] call it the five first books of Moses.
[41:49] It's not the books of Moses. It's the
[41:51] books of the Bible that Moses inspired
[41:53] was written.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see then when Moses come on
[41:57] the scene, he had a revelation because
[41:59] he met the pillar of fire.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Now the pillar of fire was what revealed
[42:04] to Moses how the Genesis Moses wasn't
[42:07] alive when God created the heavens and
[42:09] the earth.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; BUT IT GIVES A VERY detailed account of
[42:12] the book. HE TELLS HOW IT HAPPENED. AND
[42:15] IN THE BEGINNING, GOD created the
[42:16] heavens and the earth. Elohim, the words
[42:18] Elohim, right? I think the word Elohim
[42:20] appears in the first eight uh 18 times
[42:22] in the first chapter or something like
[42:23] that and the beginning God and then in
[42:25] and God on the third day and God on the
[42:27] fourth day AND GOD IT'S ALL ABOUT
[42:29] ELOHIM. SEE AND ELOHIM did this and it's
[42:32] revealed he wrote the first four books
[42:33] of the Bible for he met God in the form
[42:36] of a pillar of fire veiled in that
[42:38] pillar of fire. Now now you you look and
[42:41] see the authority that Moses had was
[42:44] because of the one he received it from.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:49] Now, that's the reality. He received it
[42:51] so he could say to you, "What you're
[42:53] receiving, I ain't giving you. But if
[42:56] you can receive what I'm saying, you're
[42:58] receiving the one that said it."
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Now, now watch what he's talking about.
[43:03] He's talking about Moses meeting the
[43:05] pillar of fire to write the Old
[43:08] Testament law. Okay? Now, when Paul met
[43:12] the same one on the road, isn't that
[43:14] amazing? Paul met the same one. The same
[43:17] one that was in that burning bush that
[43:20] talked to Moses. How did Moses know what
[43:24] he said to Abraham at the tent? Y'all
[43:26] ever THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? ABRAHAM'S
[43:28] TALKING AND in the book of Genesis the
[43:30] 18th chapter, MOSES IS ABRAHAM'S TALKING
[43:32] TO THIS ANGEL in his uh the Lord Abraham
[43:36] calls him and he's talking to him and he
[43:38] tells Sarah, "What you're thinking in
[43:40] your heart?"
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Now, who told who told Moses that? Moses
[43:45] never met Abraham.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Moses never met Sarah,
[43:48] &gt;&gt; but he's telling THE STORY AS ONE WHO
[43:51] KNOWS PERSONALLY WHAT HAPPENED THERE.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't meet Sarah AND ABRAHAM. HE MET
[43:57] THE ANGEL THAT WAS AT THE TENT DOOR.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO MOSES AND HE
[44:02] SAID, "I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC,
[44:05] AND JACOB." AND AND THAT GOD WAS
[44:08] SPEAKING TO MOSES, TELLING HIM THE
[44:10] DETAILS OF CREATION,
[44:12] &gt;&gt; TELLING HIM WHAT happened to Abraham and
[44:14] how he got the promises and how it come.
[44:16] It was that pillar of fire. So, people
[44:19] Amen. Now, I I I don't want to get too
[44:21] deep in this area, but I'll just put it
[44:22] out there for you. Amen. But, you know,
[44:24] there was probably a lot of there's
[44:26] probably a lot of stories
[44:28] &gt;&gt; during that time, folks. There was a lot
[44:30] of stories and from Adam all the way to
[44:32] Enoch. Uh uh you know there's there's a
[44:34] lot of stories gathered up and then it
[44:36] crosses over with Noah and how many
[44:38] people sat around the campfire at night
[44:39] and they told stories this way and this
[44:41] is how it happened. It happened over
[44:42] here. Brother Bam said it like this and
[44:44] he said something about the tent and he
[44:45] said something over here.
[44:48] Yeah.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; But when when Moses comes along, he has
[44:52] such an authority of how it should be
[44:56] that when he writes it, HE DARES ANYBODY
[44:59] to alter it in any way.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS REVELATION OF WHAT HAPPENED
[45:05] WAS SUPERIOR TO EVERY STORY, TO EVER HE
[45:10] SAID, SHE SAID, THIS IS HOW WE THINK IT
[45:12] TOOK PLACE. BECAUSE REVELATION IS THE
[45:15] ACCURACY THAT MAN WILL MISS.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Even if you're an eyewitness, you'll
[45:20] tell it different than the guy SITTING
[45:21] BESIDE YOU. EYEWITNESSES TELL EVERYTHING
[45:24] a little bit different.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. BUT WHEN GOD GAVE
[45:28] IT, HE GAVE THE REVELATION OF WHAT
[45:30] HAPPENED THERE.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS SO ACCURATE. NOW, YOU THINK
[45:33] ABOUT THIS BECAUSE PAUL now meeting him,
[45:36] the same one on the road to Damascus, he
[45:39] meets the same one. And when he MEETS
[45:41] HIM, AMEN. PAUL THEN BEGINS to write the
[45:44] New Testament in the Hebrew, separating
[45:46] law from grace. AND WHILE HE'S
[45:48] SEPARATING IT, HE USES THE SAME LANGUAGE
[45:51] PAUL USES AND SAID, "I DARE YOU,
[45:53] ANYBODY, TO SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN
[45:55] WHAT I'M TEACHING."
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? They had all them
[46:00] disciples that what would Jesus had all
[46:02] them believers that had followed him
[46:04] three years on the earth and Paul WAS
[46:06] NOW TELLING THEM MY REVELATION of him is
[46:09] greater than any STORY YOU'RE GOING TO
[46:11] TELL ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WHEN
[46:14] I'M DONE you let everything you say line
[46:16] up with what I'm teaching
[46:18] &gt;&gt; my goodness either he was arrogant or he
[46:20] had met somebody.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he met somebody. Amen. He met
[46:26] the very one Paul's authority. Where do
[46:28] you get this kind of authority? Can we
[46:29] read from Galatians 1:6? I hope this is
[46:31] okay.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; GALATIANS 1:6. I marvel that you are
[46:35] soon removed from him that called you
[46:37] under grace. He's telling the Galatians
[46:38] straight up that you went to ANOTHER
[46:40] GOSPEL. IN OTHER WORDS, IF you teach
[46:42] anything different than I'm teaching,
[46:44] you got another gospel
[46:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST WAS
[46:49] COMMITTED unto Paul.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Look at this. AND HE SAYS, "WHICH THERE
[46:55] IS NOT ANOTHER."
[46:57] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE SOME TROUBLE YOU and would
[47:00] pervert THIS GOSPEL. BUT THOUGH WE OR AN
[47:02] ANGEL, Paul said, "If I come around next
[47:05] month and I tell you something different
[47:07] THAN I TOLD YOU THAN ME OR an angel THAT
[47:10] WOULD COME OUT OF HEAVEN, let him be
[47:12] accursed." Y'ALL KNOW THEY TOLD BROTHER
[47:14] BRANDHAM on the on the on the on the
[47:16] teaching of the Godhead about water
[47:17] baptism. They said, "Brother Brandom, if
[47:19] you'll tell us that angel told you to
[47:21] baptize in the name of Lord Jesus, we'll
[47:23] go all be baptized name of Lord Jesus."
[47:25] And Brother Brandham says to them, HE
[47:27] SAYS, "LOOK, IF THAT ANGEL TOLD ME
[47:29] ANYTHING ELSE, I WOULD HAVE CURSE IT."
[47:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD IS MORE
[47:35] SURE THAN AN ANGEL APPEARING to you.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, WHEN THIS WORD WAS GIVEN, HE
[47:40] SAID, "LET HIM BE A CURSE." AND I SAY
[47:42] AGAIN, look at that. And now I say
[47:44] again, if any man preach any other
[47:46] gospel unto you than has received, let
[47:49] him be accursed. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
[47:51] THAT WILLIAM BRANDHAM does not have a
[47:53] MESSAGE SEPARATE FROM THE GOSPEL.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; WE WENT BEYOND THE CURTAIN OF TIME. AND
[47:58] HE SAID, "WILL PAUL BE JUDGED?" THEY
[48:00] SAID, "YES." HE SAID, "WELL, THEN I
[48:03] PREACHED WHAT PAUL PREACHED." AND THEY
[48:05] ALL SAID,
[48:07] &gt;&gt; "WE'RE RESTING ON THAT." AMEN. BECAUSE
[48:09] THERE IS NOT ANOTHER GOSPEL.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM ENLARGED THINGS
[48:14] THAT PAUL NEVER WENT INTO. AND PAUL said
[48:17] about it, didn't he? He said, "I got
[48:18] things to say, but can't say them now
[48:20] cuz you have needs." He said, "But he
[48:22] had a big teaching on Melkazdc. He
[48:24] couldn't get over." But he INTRODUCED
[48:25] IT. YEAH.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN IN THE OMEGA MINISTRY, HERE
[48:29] COMES BROTHER BRANDOM AND PICKS UP
[48:32] MELAZDC AND FLESHES IT OUT AND TEACHES
[48:34] IT FROM GENESIS UNDER REVELATION BECAUSE
[48:37] HE WASN'T TEACHING something different
[48:38] than Paul. HE WAS TEACHING THE FULLER
[48:41] REVELATION OF WHAT PAUL TAUGHT BECAUSE
[48:44] THE SEALS HAD BECOME OPENED AND THE
[48:46] MYSTERY HAD BECOME CLEAR.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. I It tears me up when
[48:52] people try to make Brother Bam's message
[48:53] something different than the Bible.
[48:56] It's not elevating brother Bam's sermons
[48:58] on the level of the Bible. It means the
[49:00] sermons he taught WAS EXPLAINING THE
[49:03] BIBLE YOU'RE READING. He didn't HAVE A
[49:05] DIFFERENT MESSAGE. HE DIDN'T HAVE A
[49:07] DIFFERENT JESUS. HE DIDN'T HAVE A JESUS
[49:10] THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT WAS
[49:11] IN THE BIBLE. HE WAS JUST SHOWING YOU
[49:14] YOUR BIBLE JESUS IS NOT DEAD. HE IS
[49:17] ALIVE MANIFESTING THE POWER OF
[49:19] [groaning and screaming] GOD IN ITS
[49:21] REALITY. HE IS JESUS. AND WILLIAM BRAND
[49:24] WAS EXALTING HIM AS JESUS. THAT'S
[49:27] EXACTLY WHAT PAUL was doing.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; It's not a DIFFERENT GOSPEL. IT'S THE
[49:31] SAME GOSPEL in power and in
[49:34] manifestation.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul says it in Galatians 1:11.
[49:39] But I certify you. I love how he say
[49:41] he's certified, man. He's he's putting
[49:43] his credentials out there. I certify you
[49:46] that the gospel which was preached of me
[49:48] is not after man.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Sure enough.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; This is not the fleshly mind of man. You
[49:52] ever heard anything like that?
[49:54] [laughter]
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I NEITHER RECEIVED IT OF man and
[49:58] neither was I taught it
[50:00] &gt;&gt; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Huh? Then he done forgot what Galia
[50:08] taught him and he got a new teacher.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. Saul
[50:15] was taught goalia. BUT PAUL WAS TAUGHT
[50:18] BY THAT PILLAR OF FIRE
[50:20] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE CHANGED HIS NAME AND HE CHANGED
[50:22] HIS TEACHING ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; He began for he said, "You have heard
[50:26] the conversation in times past and Jews.
[50:29] How beyond measure I persecuted the
[50:30] church of God and wasted it, profiting
[50:32] the Jews religion above many my equals
[50:34] my own nation, being more exceedingly
[50:36] jealous in the traditions of my fathers.
[50:38] But when IT PLEASED GOD, WHO SEPARATED
[50:41] ME from my MOTHER'S WOMB, AND CALLED me
[50:43] by his grace, to reveal his son in me,
[50:45] that I might preach unto among the
[50:47] heathen, immediately I conferred not
[50:49] with flesh and blood, neither I ran up
[50:52] to Jerusalem, WHICH WERE THE APOSTLES
[50:54] WERE BEFORE ME. BUT I WENT into Arabia,
[50:57] and returned unto Damascus. Then after 3
[51:00] years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter
[51:02] and abode with him for 15 days. Isn't it
[51:05] amazing? He when he has this experience,
[51:08] Amen. on the road to Damascus, WHEN PAUL
[51:11] HAS THIS EXPERIENCE, he has met the
[51:13] pillar of fire. How many ever read Paul?
[51:15] Amen. I I don't have time to read it
[51:16] tonight. How many ever read it where
[51:18] Paul met the pillar of fire? He's going
[51:20] he's going to he's going to persecute
[51:22] the Christians. And on his way, he meets
[51:26] the pillar of fire which he recognizes
[51:29] from Galia's teachings that this is the
[51:32] God that hung over the meeting in the
[51:35] tabernacle IN THE WILDERNESS. HE
[51:37] RECOGNIZES THIS IS THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[51:40] THAT LED MY PEOPLE THAT LED MY PEOPLE
[51:44] FROM EGYPT UNTO THIS GREAT PROMISED
[51:46] LAND. HE RECOGNIZES THAT THE ONE HE IS
[51:49] MEETING IS THAT PILLAR OF FIRE AND HE
[51:52] HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY, "LORD, WHO ARE
[51:54] YOU?"
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Capital L O R D. A Jew is recognizing
[52:00] Jehovah as a pillar of fire. AND THE
[52:03] VOICE SPOKE BACK OUT OF IT AND SAID, "I
[52:05] am Jesus.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; I AM JESUS." AND WHOM THEN BROTHER BRAM
[52:10] SAID, "OH my goodness, watch him." He
[52:11] said, "I came from God and I have
[52:13] returned to God." If you wonder about
[52:15] the mystery of that pillar of fire,
[52:17] don't wonder no more. AMEN. IT WAS GOD
[52:19] IN THE BEGINNING AND IT BECAME FLESH AND
[52:22] THE MAN JESUS CHRIST THE DEATH, BURIAL,
[52:25] AND RESURRECTION. THAT PILLAR OF FIRE,
[52:27] AMEN, TURNED BACK TO GOD. MET PAUL AND
[52:30] SAID, "MY NAME IS JESUS." AND PAUL, I'M
[52:33] GOING TO SEND YOU UNDER THE GENTILES AND
[52:36] YOU WILL PREACH FOR MY NAME'S sake and
[52:38] suffer many things. And Paul went blind.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? And God had to blind
[52:43] his eyes to open his eyes.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's the kind of blinders
[52:47] church needs, ain't it? It blinded him
[52:49] to his traditions and blinded him from
[52:51] his purposes and blinded him from his
[52:53] persecutions. BUT WHEN HE HAD BLINDED
[52:55] EYES, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE, HE
[52:58] SAW THE THINGS HE OUGHT TO SEE. AMEN.
[53:00] AND GOD KEPT HIM FROM SINNING AGAIN. CAN
[53:03] YOU IMAGINE WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO DO? BUT
[53:05] GOD KEPT HIM. WE PRAY, WE PRAISE GOD ALL
[53:07] THE TIME FOR THE WONDERFUL things that
[53:08] he does through us. But what about the
[53:10] things he keeps YOU FROM DOING? WHAT
[53:12] ABOUT THE PLACES THAT HE GETS IN THE WAY
[53:14] AND HE DON'T LET YOU DO WHAT YOU THOUGHT
[53:15] YOU WERE GOING TO DO BECAUSE IT'S THE
[53:17] GRACE OF GOD. And Paul went down there
[53:20] and it's always amazed me. They called
[53:22] the city the street he went to called
[53:24] Straight Street. Paul needs some
[53:26] straightening. So he went to Straight
[53:27] Street.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And it was there that God told Ananas,
[53:30] y'all heard that song, oh Ananas.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; We got to sing that. Oh, Ananas,
[53:40] tell me what kind of man Jesus is.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; That Ananas right there. He went down
[53:45] there to Paul and God said, "Paul, go
[53:48] down there." And the Lord, the Lord's
[53:50] speaking to Ananas, to go pray for Paul
[53:51] because he's blind. Hey, Amen. You know,
[53:54] it's pretty amazing because he speaks
[53:55] right back to him and said, "Lord, he
[53:56] kills Christians.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; He kills. You want to send me down to
[54:00] that man kills Christians?" And the Lord
[54:02] said, "Don't worry." He prays.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; He prays. And when he knocked on the
[54:07] door and he got down in the scripture,
[54:08] the Bible said Paul opened the door and
[54:10] Ananas said, "Brother Saul,
[54:13] &gt;&gt; my goodness." Amen. Brother Saul, he had
[54:16] already become his brother because he
[54:17] knew there had been some repentance. And
[54:19] the Bible says he prayed and the scale
[54:21] fell from his EYES AND THE HOLY GHOST
[54:23] ENTERED INSIDE PAUL.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; You know what he did? HE HAD HAD SUCH A
[54:27] SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE THAT HE COULDN'T
[54:29] BEING A JEW, he couldn't understand. BUT
[54:32] WHEN HE WENT BACK AND THE BIBLE SAID HE
[54:34] WENT THREE years in the place of Arabia.
[54:37] Now y'all y'all y'all know the prophet
[54:39] said that Arabia was the desert. And
[54:41] what Paul did is he had a spiritual
[54:43] experience. And that Jew was not about
[54:46] to accept that experience till he saw it
[54:48] in the word of God.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Took him three years. Brother Ram said
[54:54] he rented him a little room out there in
[54:55] Arabia and went through it. I got
[54:57] studying on Arabia today. I don't know
[54:59] if you've ever made the study, but they
[55:01] but but Arabia today is not really what
[55:03] Arabia was then. And it's amazing. I I
[55:06] did not know this, but Petra was the
[55:07] capital of Arabia back in that day. I've
[55:09] been to Petra. It's in Jordan. It's
[55:11] where they carve the city out of the
[55:13] rocks. I was unimpressed completely. But
[55:14] if I knew Paul had been there,
[55:16] [laughter]
[55:18] I'd have paid attention.
[55:21] It would have meant something way
[55:22] different to me. I could have had tea
[55:24] where Paul was having tea. I did, but I
[55:26] just didn't know it.
[55:28] But it went back to Arabia. Now, this is
[55:31] amazing to me because this is something
[55:32] else I didn't know. Brother didn't say
[55:34] this. I found it in the scripture. But
[55:36] do you know that there's something else
[55:38] in Arabia? In Galatians chapter 4, Paul
[55:41] tells you that there's an allegory of a
[55:44] bond woman and a free woman. And he
[55:46] says, "One of them is Aar, which is
[55:49] Mount Si in Arabia." In the 24th verse,
[55:52] he tells you Mount Si IS IN ARABIA. PAUL
[55:56] IS GOING BACK TO WHERE THE LAW WAS
[55:58] ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. LOOK AT THIS THIS
[56:00] THIS THIS LAW. THIS MAN THAT STUDIED THE
[56:03] LAW HIS WHOLE LIFE. AMEN. NOW, I don't
[56:05] have brother Bram saying this. This is
[56:07] just scripture. LOOK AT LOOK AT THIS.
[56:08] THIS MAN STUDYING THE LAW HIS WHOLE LIFE
[56:11] AND MEETS THE ONE THAT WROTE THE LAW,
[56:13] THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, AND NOW HE'S GOING
[56:15] BACK TO WHERE THE LAW ORIGINALLY was
[56:17] written. AND HE'S STUDYING THE LAW IN
[56:20] THE PLACE IT CAME FROM UNDER THE AUTHOR
[56:23] OF IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND WHEN HE
[56:24] RETURNS from Arabia, HE HAS THIS
[56:28] REVELATION THAT JESUS is the Jehovah of
[56:31] THE OLD TESTAMENT. HE'S ACTUALLY RETURNS
[56:34] WITH A REVELATION. NOW, let me just let
[56:36] me just take it to this point. Brother
[56:38] Random says this very clearly. He said,
[56:40] "God separated Paul so he could put the
[56:42] word together. He took Moses to the
[56:44] desert so he could get the law out of
[56:47] Moses." And do you recognize that God
[56:49] took William Brandham to the desert?
[56:52] But a man said, "WHAT AM I DOING OUT
[56:54] HERE IN THIS DESERT?" GOD SEPARATED me
[56:56] from everybody. And then the prophet
[56:58] said, "There come the revelation." HE
[57:00] SEPARATED PAUL. HE SEPARATED MOSES AND
[57:03] HE SEPARATED WILLIAM BRANDHAM. AND THE
[57:06] SAME, NOW THE REALITY HERE, FOLKS, IS
[57:08] THE SAME PILLAR OF fire that wrote the
[57:11] Old Testament, wrote the New Testament,
[57:14] and visited William Brandom to rebr.
[57:26] What did he do out there? He opened up
[57:29] them seals. He separated them. Now,
[57:32] watch what Paul is saying. Amen. I I got
[57:34] a bunch on that. I'm going to I'm going
[57:35] to close here shortly. So, let's just
[57:37] let's just move into this point and then
[57:39] I'll I'll come back to that. Now, pillar
[57:41] of fire is the experience that Paul is
[57:43] studying and he actually returns.
[57:46] Brother Bam says in the days of Moses
[57:48] and this they could have took a picture
[57:50] of it.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; They could have took Put the picture up
[57:54] there right quick. We'll we'll visit it
[57:55] again sometime. But the pillar of fire
[57:57] that they took over to the Sam Houston
[57:59] Coliseum, that pillar of fire, the angel
[58:03] of the Lord, Brother Bam talks about all
[58:04] the time stepped out of that light. How
[58:07] many knows that? I just played it for
[58:08] you.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; You said, "Where'd that angel of the
[58:11] Lord?" Brother Bam said, "It stepped out
[58:12] of that light."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'd seen that light and I'd
[58:16] heard that voice, but that angel stepped
[58:19] out of it." He said, "And it wasn't
[58:20] Jesus. I've seen him two different
[58:22] times." He said, "He's a smaller man
[58:24] than this angel. Yeah.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; And he said he stepped out of that light
[58:29] &gt;&gt; because he was an angel of his presence.
[58:31] The angel of the Lord. How many knows
[58:33] that's God's angel? How many knows that
[58:35] when God took angelic form?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He came as a messenger to to a
[58:40] prophet. Think about it. That pillar of
[58:42] fire, that's what wrote the Bible,
[58:44] folks.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; You have a picture of it. Yeah,
[58:52] &gt;&gt; you can read it in the book of Genesis
[58:54] and you read about it in the book of
[58:56] Acts, but you're sitting here tonight
[58:58] with a visible picture
[59:01] &gt;&gt; that the FBI combed over this picture
[59:03] and said it's not psychology.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; The light was there.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took this picture and
[59:11] said, "Folks, you're better to look at
[59:13] this picture than to see it in the room
[59:16] because somebody might be playing tricks
[59:18] with lights on you." He said, "BUT THAT
[59:21] IS PHOTOGRAPHED and it proven to be the
[59:23] only SUPERNATURAL PHOTOGRAPH." NO WONDER
[59:26] THE DEVIL'S ATTACKING this photo.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; HE'S TURNED ALL THE GUNS OF HELL AGAINST
[59:31] IT. AND AND I JUST LOVE TO SHOW IT ON
[59:33] OFTEN TIMES TO TELL THAT DEVIL, WE'RE
[59:35] FOLLOWING THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE WE'RE
[59:38] FOLLOWING THAT LIGHT.
[59:40] [applause]
[59:41] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ASHAMED OF THIS MESSAGE. WE'RE
[59:43] NOT ASHAMED OF THAT LIGHT. IT'S THE ONE
[59:45] THAT WROTE THIS BIBLE. AND THAT PILLAR
[59:47] OF FIRE, BROTHER Bram says, is appearing
[59:49] among us to identify this message is
[59:52] right. This message is right. Now watch
[59:55] this as we close tonight. God in
[59:58] sunundra times, first verse of Hebrews,
[1:00:00] God in sunundra times and in diverse
[1:00:02] manners spake in times past by their
[1:00:04] fathers. That word in sunundra times,
[1:00:07] diverse manners actually means it means
[1:00:11] uh it's spelled p o l u m- e rs. That's
[1:00:14] actually Greek. How many realizes that
[1:00:16] the Old Testament is Hebrew, the New
[1:00:18] Testament's Greek?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; So if you're studying sometimes English
[1:00:22] words, it'll say it one way in the New,
[1:00:24] it say one way in the Old. That's
[1:00:26] because they're written in different
[1:00:27] languages previously.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Because the the actual
[1:00:32] word means this by many portions, by
[1:00:37] many times, in many ways.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; God
[1:00:42] in many times, hundred times. Yeah.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; In many times under many ways.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; By many portions.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Now you you say, "Preacher,
[1:00:55] why is this the beginning of the book of
[1:00:58] Hebrews?" Because Paul's telling you a
[1:01:01] real solid thing here.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; God
[1:01:05] appears many times.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. in many ways,
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; in many forms,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; but the central theme of this entire
[1:01:14] Bible, William Brandham took it for his
[1:01:17] theme song, Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:21] yesterday, today and forever. He's
[1:01:24] starting the first verse with God in
[1:01:27] many times, in many ways, in many
[1:01:29] portions, but God remains the same.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; He's always God. Yeah,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; brother Nathan, the Bible says, "In the
[1:01:37] beginning, God created the heavens and
[1:01:39] earth." And theologians have took that
[1:01:40] and called it Elohim.
[1:01:43] And every theologian you read will say
[1:01:45] the word Elohim is plural.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; But you know what's amazing?
[1:01:52] He's not plural in person, folks.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; He's plural in attribute.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; He's plural in manifestation. And that's
[1:02:01] what Paul begins his Hebrew letter with
[1:02:05] is that God appears in many times, in
[1:02:08] many ways and speaks a lot of ways,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; but he remains the same
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, forever. Won't you
[1:02:15] stand to your feet with us tonight?
[1:02:29] God in many times, many ways. I just
[1:02:34] love this book of Hebrews.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; I can't say it with authority, but I
[1:02:41] think it's amazing
[1:02:43] that Paul
[1:02:45] would go back to the very areas where
[1:02:48] that law was written
[1:02:51] to get a revelation.
[1:02:54] Paul is dispensational prophet. That's
[1:02:57] what he's teaching. dispensations.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; He's a dispensational prophet.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Moses is a dispensational prophet.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Three years he spent in Arabia. Three.
[1:03:09] Three years.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that Isn't that Isn't that
[1:03:12] amazing,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; brother Kyle? The disciples spent three
[1:03:18] years with Jesus walking in Jerusalem.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And Paul spent the same amount of years
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; walking with a pillar of fire.
[1:03:28] He was more qualified to teach
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; after three years with a pillar of fire
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; than the disciples with three years in
[1:03:36] his earthly ministry.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Because he didn't just know him in the
[1:03:39] flesh.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; He knew him in the power
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; of his resurrection. That's the way I
[1:03:45] want to know him tonight.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's the way I want to know him.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; I want to know him in his power,
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; the power of his revelation. Do you love
[1:03:53] him tonight?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother Ben,
[1:03:58] I saw [singing] the light.
[1:04:01] I saw the light.
[1:04:04] No more in darkness. [music and singing]

[1:04:51] I wouldn't let my [singing]
[1:04:53] dear savior in. [music]

[1:05:06] light.
