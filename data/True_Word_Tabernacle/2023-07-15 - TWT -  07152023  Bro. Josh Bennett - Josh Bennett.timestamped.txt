[42:05] we're blessed to have brother Joshua
[42:08] Bennett with us a minister preacher
[42:10] message of the hour Amen brother Josh
[42:13] and I've been Muslim friends for years
[42:16] and years and and I've seen I've seen
[42:19] the character of Christ amen in a in an
[42:22] end time and a gift that God has placed
[42:24] in his life and he pastors a church
[42:27] there in Hickory North Carolina or
[42:29] Newton North Carolina many of you know
[42:31] brother Josh it's Apostolic Tabernacle
[42:34] they just finished building the church
[42:35] actually
[42:36] and just had their dedication meetings
[42:39] in June amen we were able to go down and
[42:41] be a part of that and it's a real
[42:43] blessing to have him with us tonight
[42:45] also he brought sister Kimberly with him
[42:48] thank you sister Kimberly for coming and
[42:50] the girls and I think Hannah and Abigail
[42:52] maybe Emma in the middle there
[42:53] appreciate you all coming and being a
[42:55] part of our service tonight and amen
[42:58] that brother Josh would take time to
[42:59] come amen I know you all are going to be
[43:02] greatly blessed amen and I I was just
[43:06] thinking about it on the way to church
[43:07] and I was thinking about in the times of
[43:09] Jesus
[43:10] when
[43:12] the Bible talks about when Jesus was to
[43:14] pass by away
[43:17] and
[43:19] when he was to go through a certain way
[43:21] there would always be a crowd around
[43:22] there'd be people and
[43:25] and I've often think of that one little
[43:27] lady who was having the issue of blood
[43:30] and
[43:31] when Jesus was going by she said I just
[43:33] want to touch you
[43:35] [Music]
[43:36] if you study the history on it she
[43:38] really wasn't allowed to because of her
[43:41] uncleanliness or condition
[43:44] but there was something in her heart to
[43:45] believe that if she could just touch it
[43:48] she didn't want to maybe disturb the
[43:51] crowd or anybody even know that she did
[43:53] it
[43:54] but something in her heart believed if I
[43:56] could just touch it
[43:58] and you know the Messiah
[44:00] is passing by this way tonight
[44:03] [Music]
[44:04] as some believe that our Messiah is dead
[44:06] but
[44:08] on the third day he rose again
[44:10] and brother Graham said it's not some
[44:12] man here is the messiah
[44:14] but his spirit
[44:16] William Branham proved without one
[44:19] question
[44:20] that the Messiah is still alive today
[44:24] and that he can still be touched the
[44:26] same way
[44:28] that that woman touched him in that
[44:29] street you could touch him tonight
[44:31] he used to pass this way you said
[44:33] brother Wayne how do I touch him well
[44:35] when this man of God comes to this
[44:36] pulpit
[44:37] you know him as brother Josh I know him
[44:39] as brother Josh but God deposited
[44:42] a gift in that man's life
[44:44] [Music]
[44:46] and that gift is put here for the body
[44:48] of Christ and when you begin to pull on
[44:50] that gift
[44:51] the holy spirit will take a hold of the
[44:53] man and he'll begin to use him
[44:55] in that office will begin to open up and
[44:57] things that you've prayed about you've
[45:00] questioned you've desired
[45:02] you're sitting here with a need and you
[45:04] can reach out and touch the Messiah and
[45:06] brother Josh won't even know maybe what
[45:07] he's saying in the Holy Spirit of direct
[45:10] him a certain way and you'll know
[45:13] you'll know that that's him
[45:16] and he's here and he's in the midst of
[45:18] it say man I believe he could be touched
[45:20] tonight don't you believe it would you
[45:22] reach out when he comes passing by
[45:23] tonight say Lord I want you to touch me
[45:25] I want you to touch my need amen how
[45:28] many needs a miracle tonight
[45:30] need a miracle here tonight I was just
[45:33] this song was on my heart coming to
[45:34] church and I was just thinking about
[45:36] miracles and and the and the need and
[45:39] this little song just came on my heart
[45:40] there's a miracle in the making amen I
[45:45] think it actually has one verse that it

[56:09] can just find a way to relax and you
[56:12] know a lot of times when you when I
[56:14] Minister other places I get so nervous
[56:17] and and I I try so hard I think
[56:20] sometimes but I just want to relax and
[56:23] if that's okay I'm just going to try to
[56:27] preach like I'm at home tonight amen and
[56:30] so um you just I pray I trust if I can
[56:33] relax and you can relax then God can
[56:35] just have his way amen but let's just
[56:37] turn in our Bibles tonight to the book
[56:39] of Philippians
[56:41] foreign
[56:44] Philippians chapter 2 and I'm also going
[56:47] to read one verse out of First
[56:48] Corinthians the second chapter
[56:51] very familiar scriptures that we're
[56:54] looking at this evening and just some
[56:56] things that the Lord's been dealing with
[56:58] me I just had on my heart for some time
[57:02] and and so we uh just uh
[57:07] want to look at this tonight Philippians
[57:08] 2
[57:09] and verse 5
[57:11] let this mind be in you
[57:14] which was also in Christ Jesus
[57:16] who being in the form of God thought it
[57:19] not robbery to be equal with God
[57:22] but made of himself no reputation
[57:25] and took upon him the form of a servant
[57:28] and was made in the likeness of men
[57:31] and being found in fashion as a man he
[57:35] humbled himself
[57:36] became obedient unto death
[57:39] even the death of the cross
[57:43] amen First Corinthians the second
[57:45] chapter just one verse there verse 16.
[57:53] I just love
[57:55] for this chapter the whole chapter is
[57:58] just powerful but
[58:00] I love this verse
[58:03] for who had known the mind of the Lord
[58:06] that he may instruct him
[58:08] but we have
[58:10] the mind of Christ amen how many is glad
[58:14] that you have the mind of Christ I mean
[58:16] you can have your seats this evening
[58:22] I want to speak to you for a few minutes
[58:24] by God's help on the mind of Christ
[58:28] in an age of insanity
[58:32] and how many how many believes that
[58:35] you're living in an age of insanity
[58:37] you know it's called the information age
[58:41] uh or it's also known as a computer age
[58:44] or the digital age and um this age they
[58:49] actually have marked the beginning of
[58:51] this age of information uh they've
[58:54] linked it to discoveries that were made
[58:57] there in 1947 which I thought that was
[58:59] very interesting that that they would
[59:01] link it to that year in particular
[59:04] because we know that you know it's uh
[59:06] the first recordings that we have of our
[59:08] Prophet was in that year but they have
[59:11] marked this as an age of information and
[59:15] and and and there's never been a time on
[59:17] the earth that information is shared the
[59:20] way it is in this age and and and you
[59:23] know how that you know the whole world
[59:25] has been uh the whole globe has been
[59:28] linked together and and communication is
[59:31] uh become so possible because of the
[59:34] technology that we have and the way the
[59:36] information is shared but so it's an age
[59:39] of of great knowledge and and they claim
[59:42] it to be an age of great understanding
[59:44] but but you know I I believe that it was
[59:47] prophesied in the scripture Daniel spoke
[59:49] of it there in Daniel 12 and 4 uh where
[59:52] the Bible says but thou Daniel shut up
[59:54] the words and seal the book even to the
[59:57] time of the end so we know that this is
[59:59] an end time scripture amen and it says
[1:00:01] that many shall run to and fro and
[1:00:04] knowledge shall be increased amen and so
[1:00:07] we know that that's true Brother Band
[1:00:09] would even say there in the message this
[1:00:11] day this scripture is fulfilled he said
[1:00:12] he he takes that he says it's the
[1:00:15] increase in science scientific research
[1:00:18] he said now at one time my grandfather
[1:00:20] went to see my grandmother in an ox cart
[1:00:22] and now it's in a jet plane or even in
[1:00:25] orbit into the air into outer space and
[1:00:28] who said this Daniel chapter Daniel 12
[1:00:31] and 4 knowledge shall increase in the
[1:00:33] last days and we see the hour that we're
[1:00:36] living in as to continue edition of the
[1:00:38] world the condition of Science and now a
[1:00:40] prophet's telling you that the the
[1:00:42] increase of knowledge on the earth and
[1:00:44] the scientific uh achievements is a sign
[1:00:48] of the end time amen then the Bible also
[1:00:51] says in the in the New Testament there
[1:00:52] in second Timothy 3 and verse 7 that
[1:00:55] they would be ever learning but never
[1:00:57] coming to the knowledge of the truth so
[1:01:00] amen this would be an age or a time of
[1:01:03] great knowledge where men would be ever
[1:01:05] learning amen and their knowledge as far
[1:01:08] as the the knowledge of the world would
[1:01:10] be increasing all the time amen but they
[1:01:13] would never come to the knowledge of the
[1:01:15] truth so we know by these scriptures
[1:01:17] that the knowledge that Daniel's talking
[1:01:19] about is not the knowledge of God Amen
[1:01:22] it's not the wisdom of God Amen but it's
[1:01:25] the knowledge of man and amen and it
[1:01:28] will continue to increase until the time
[1:01:30] of the end and and but yet even though
[1:01:33] that they would be ever learning and how
[1:01:35] many believes that man is in this this
[1:01:37] this scripture here in second Timothy is
[1:01:40] being fulfilled in this hour that man is
[1:01:43] ever learning but but they're not able
[1:01:45] to come to the knowledge of Truth so
[1:01:48] they have no understanding of the word
[1:01:50] amen matter of fact the smarter they get
[1:01:52] the further away from God they get is
[1:01:55] that true brother Rand would say it this
[1:01:57] way it shows us that it's not just
[1:01:59] learning we can't even listen I'll just
[1:02:01] say it this way even us as Believers we
[1:02:04] just don't come and sit down even just
[1:02:06] to learn the scriptures or amen or to
[1:02:09] get an intellectual understanding of the
[1:02:11] word amen that is not what's going to
[1:02:13] give you power over the devil but the
[1:02:16] prophet said it would be Revelation see
[1:02:18] amen and Revelation is not just you
[1:02:20] don't sit down and learn Revelation
[1:02:22] Revelation is sovereignly given to a
[1:02:25] Believer by the spirit of God
[1:02:27] amen how many is thankful for the
[1:02:29] Revelation amen but you see the
[1:02:31] difference in brother Brown said he said
[1:02:33] see ever learning said brother we got
[1:02:35] seminaries we got schools we got phds
[1:02:38] and dhds and ddds and Q STS I I don't
[1:02:42] even know what all these stand for but
[1:02:43] amen all kinds of everything ever
[1:02:45] learning but never able to come to the
[1:02:48] knowledge of the truth that's right amen
[1:02:50] we've got doctors degrees and we send
[1:02:52] our children away to a seminary
[1:02:53] somewhere and get some great big degree
[1:02:55] or something other like that amen and
[1:02:58] there's still something wrong so amen he
[1:03:00] said even after all that there's
[1:03:01] something missing I thought this was
[1:03:03] just uh outstanding that brother man
[1:03:05] would say this he said the devil knows
[1:03:07] more about the Bible than you'll ever
[1:03:09] know
[1:03:10] I tell you that now he knows all about
[1:03:13] amen some of the best Bible students I
[1:03:16] ever met were infidels even they just
[1:03:19] study it day and night to fuss with you
[1:03:21] about it the Bible isn't to be fussed
[1:03:25] about the Bible is to be lived
[1:03:28] amen I tell you I I hate to say it this
[1:03:31] way and don't think I'm being too
[1:03:32] critical but I've met some message
[1:03:34] people that sometimes you know they know
[1:03:36] a lot about the message and they study
[1:03:38] the message a lot but for what purpose
[1:03:40] amen because they'll stand there and
[1:03:42] argue with you all day long about the
[1:03:44] quotes but amen but is it becoming a
[1:03:46] life and you see amen is it is it is it
[1:03:50] more than just amen you know knowing how
[1:03:53] much knowledge you can can gain or
[1:03:55] retain in your mind or amen what you can
[1:03:58] recall by memory amen or is it a
[1:04:00] revelation that God has placed down in
[1:04:03] your heart see even that is what the
[1:04:06] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:04:09] amen but you see as we look at this it's
[1:04:11] an age of of knowledge it's an age of
[1:04:14] understanding it's the information age
[1:04:16] amen but brother uh uh uh Brandon would
[1:04:19] go to the scripture here in Revelations
[1:04:21] 3 and he begins to show the condition of
[1:04:25] the laodicean church age and I'm just
[1:04:27] going to read it Revelations 3 and 14
[1:04:29] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[1:04:32] laodice right these things saith thee
[1:04:34] amen the faithful and the true witness
[1:04:36] the beginning of the creation of God I
[1:04:38] Know Thy works that thou art neither
[1:04:40] cold nor hot I would that thou work cold
[1:04:42] or hot so then because they are lukewarm
[1:04:45] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[1:04:48] thee out of my mouth because thou sayest
[1:04:50] see that I'm rich and increase with
[1:04:53] goods and have need of nothing and no
[1:04:56] it's not this is what I want you to
[1:04:58] catch and no it's not that thou art
[1:05:01] wretched miserable and poor and blind
[1:05:04] and naked now amen it's one thing to be
[1:05:07] in that condition but it is something
[1:05:10] different to be in that condition and
[1:05:12] not know it
[1:05:13] brother Brown would say how you know
[1:05:15] that's quite a condition to be in Amen
[1:05:17] to be naked and you don't know it
[1:05:19] they meant to be blind and you don't
[1:05:22] know it amen remember the man that come
[1:05:24] to brother Brandon one day and said you
[1:05:26] know talk about the power of God and if
[1:05:28] you who or you claim you are and I'll
[1:05:30] strike me blind brother Ben said how
[1:05:32] could I do it you are already blind amen
[1:05:35] but he didn't know that he was in that
[1:05:37] condition amen and you got a whole world
[1:05:39] of people out here even that are in a
[1:05:42] condition of uh uh they're naked and
[1:05:45] they're and they're wretched and they're
[1:05:46] miserable and amen and all this but they
[1:05:48] don't know that they're in that
[1:05:50] condition amen it shows you amen the the
[1:05:53] that the age is going is falling into
[1:05:57] insanity
[1:05:58] amen you know in the church age but he
[1:06:00] would go back to this scripture and he
[1:06:02] said how fitting are the characteristics
[1:06:04] of this last age to represent the age in
[1:06:07] which we now live even there the name
[1:06:09] laodicea means the people's rights or
[1:06:12] the Justice of the people and amen and
[1:06:15] we know that there's never been a time
[1:06:17] on the Earth where people are are so
[1:06:19] caught up in their rights and
[1:06:21] everybody's got their rights I mean you
[1:06:23] know uh the homosexuals has got their
[1:06:25] rights and and the transgenders got
[1:06:27] their right and every group and every
[1:06:29] amen everybody that you can think of
[1:06:31] they got their rights and and they're
[1:06:33] demanding more rights all the time amen
[1:06:36] because it's the spirit of the age but
[1:06:38] but listen that's not just because it's
[1:06:40] the spirit of the age don't mean it's
[1:06:42] the spirit of Christ
[1:06:44] just because it's the spirit of the
[1:06:45] church don't mean that it's the right
[1:06:47] spirit because brother Brown comes along
[1:06:49] says listen amen we are lambs
[1:06:53] amen we're we're the Sheep of his
[1:06:55] pasture amen and we forfeit our rights
[1:06:57] amen that's a real Christian right there
[1:07:00] amen you got it right brother and says
[1:07:02] to the American you got a right to do
[1:07:04] anything you want to do you got a right
[1:07:05] to go down and drink and smoke and amen
[1:07:08] you can wear what you want to wear and
[1:07:09] you can go where you want to go amen
[1:07:11] that's your American right amen but as a
[1:07:13] Son of God you forfeit that right
[1:07:16] Hallelujah and surrender your life amen
[1:07:19] to the word of God is that right
[1:07:21] amen but it's the age of people's rights
[1:07:24] now he goes on to say amen he talks
[1:07:26] about the city because remember there
[1:07:27] was amen there was seven churches and
[1:07:30] Seven Cities and and those cities even
[1:07:33] those cities themselves would represent
[1:07:34] a a condition of of the age is that
[1:07:38] right and and the City of laodicea was
[1:07:41] rich and it was endued with uh wealth
[1:07:43] and it was full of culture and Science
[1:07:46] abounded and Brethren said how like
[1:07:48] today the churches are rich the worship
[1:07:50] is beautiful and formal but cold and
[1:07:53] dead amen culture and education has
[1:07:56] taken the place of a spirit-given word
[1:07:58] and faith has been superseded by science
[1:08:01] so that man has become a victim of
[1:08:03] materialism and every attribute
[1:08:06] anciently ought to sit or laodicea is
[1:08:08] found reborn in the 20th century amen I
[1:08:12] see an age so that city was representing
[1:08:15] an age or a a church age a span of time
[1:08:18] amen and look amen as he shows this amen
[1:08:21] they had an attitude they had a a a
[1:08:23] condition and they had a testimony if
[1:08:26] you'd call it that amen they were saying
[1:08:28] we have need of nothing
[1:08:30] amen we're rich and increasingly good
[1:08:32] and don't need nothing amen and watch
[1:08:35] what the prophet said he said when
[1:08:36] somebody says I have need of nothing he
[1:08:39] could be very well saying I have
[1:08:41] everything or he could be saying I don't
[1:08:43] want any more as I am now full amen you
[1:08:47] can express it any way you want to but
[1:08:48] it all adds up to the fact that the
[1:08:51] church is complacent
[1:08:54] she is satisfied in what she has or
[1:08:57] either figures she has it all or has
[1:09:00] enough
[1:09:01] is that right and that's exactly what we
[1:09:03] find today amen what denomination is it
[1:09:06] is or that's not claiming that it has a
[1:09:09] revelation and the power and The Truth
[1:09:11] Listen to The Baptists and they have it
[1:09:13] all listen to the methodists and they
[1:09:14] have it on listen to the Church of
[1:09:16] Christ and every one of them is Rome
[1:09:18] amen but and you hear the Pentecostals
[1:09:20] and they say that they have the fullness
[1:09:22] of the fullness is that right amen he
[1:09:25] said now I know they know I'm telling
[1:09:26] the truth about them because even there
[1:09:28] ain't one of their manuals that don't
[1:09:30] say different amen they wrote it all out
[1:09:32] just put it nice put their names to it
[1:09:34] finish it all up amen and God just don't
[1:09:37] have any more see amen they come they
[1:09:39] said this is what we have amen is that
[1:09:41] what they're saying they're they're
[1:09:42] putting a period behind it they're
[1:09:44] they're saying we got it we got the
[1:09:46] revelation we got the truth amen we got
[1:09:48] the answer amen but see watch as he says
[1:09:51] this he said they wrote it all out
[1:09:52] finish it all up and said God ain't got
[1:09:55] no more and then there's those who just
[1:09:57] don't want no more
[1:09:59] even they don't believe in healing it
[1:10:02] wouldn't want it although it's in the
[1:10:03] word there's those that would not take
[1:10:05] the Holy Spirit if God opened up the
[1:10:07] heavens and showed them a sign
[1:10:10] amen now they're saying and trying to
[1:10:13] prove that they have it all or that they
[1:10:15] have enough
[1:10:17] yet is that the truth
[1:10:19] amen compare this 20th century Church to
[1:10:22] the first century church just go ahead
[1:10:25] and do that where's the power
[1:10:27] where's the love
[1:10:29] where's that purified church that
[1:10:31] withstood sin and walked with faith
[1:10:33] toward Jesus where's the unity you can't
[1:10:36] find it if this church has all it needs
[1:10:38] then why were they crying out for more
[1:10:41] of God in the book of Acts and so they
[1:10:43] didn't have it all and yet they had far
[1:10:45] more than what they have today
[1:10:47] that's a good question ain't it amen at
[1:10:50] the Modern church out here amen has all
[1:10:53] they need amen then why amen was it that
[1:10:56] in the book of Acts amen that they were
[1:10:58] crying out even you find just amen there
[1:11:01] in Acts chapter four amen right after
[1:11:03] they've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:05] they were already crying for a refilling
[1:11:07] of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:09] hallelujah amen and I like what the
[1:11:11] promise says he's showing you amen if we
[1:11:14] amen if the modern church has enough
[1:11:16] amen has always all it needs amen then
[1:11:20] then why are we not measuring up then
[1:11:22] what to what the first church had
[1:11:26] Hallelujah
[1:11:28] he says see that was all their
[1:11:31] estimation
[1:11:32] but God saw something entirely different
[1:11:36] amen he said that if they said that they
[1:11:40] were rich and increased with goods and
[1:11:41] spiritually wealthy that they had
[1:11:43] arrived they hadn't need another but God
[1:11:45] saw it otherwise he said you don't know
[1:11:47] this but you're wretched miserable poor
[1:11:50] blind and naked
[1:11:51] and when people are that way especially
[1:11:53] naked and don't know it there has to be
[1:11:56] something awfully wrong
[1:11:58] listen rich and you say well brother you
[1:12:00] know I don't know exactly what you're
[1:12:03] talking about well I'll tell you just
[1:12:04] just next time you see a a woman out
[1:12:07] there in a pair of shorts tell her she's
[1:12:08] naked and see what kind of response you
[1:12:10] get
[1:12:11] amen they'll look at you like you're
[1:12:13] crazy but she's as naked as she can be
[1:12:16] according to the word of God in God's
[1:12:18] eyes she's naked
[1:12:20] amen but she don't know it wouldn't
[1:12:21] believe it if you told her amen but
[1:12:23] friends I'm just pointing that out to
[1:12:25] you amen what the condition of the women
[1:12:27] out here is only showing you the
[1:12:29] spiritual condition of the church
[1:12:32] amen why are they cutting off their hair
[1:12:34] amen why are they doing these things
[1:12:36] amen amen because it's a representation
[1:12:39] of the condition of a church the church
[1:12:42] is rejected the Hashem of Jesus Christ
[1:12:44] amen they have fulfilled their scripture
[1:12:46] amen of the church allowed to see it and
[1:12:49] put Christ on the outside amen can you
[1:12:52] say Amen
[1:12:53] ABA and as a result of that she is
[1:12:56] wretched miserable poor and blind and
[1:12:59] naked and don't even know it
[1:13:03] God says this age is wretched how
[1:13:06] strange how strange in an age of Plenty
[1:13:08] in an age of progress in an age of
[1:13:11] abundance How can there be trials that
[1:13:14] we we well now it's strange but in this
[1:13:17] age of plenty of opportunity when
[1:13:19] everybody has so much and there's so
[1:13:20] much more to be had with all the
[1:13:22] inventions to do our work and so many
[1:13:24] things uh to give us pleasure suddenly
[1:13:28] we find mental illness taking such a
[1:13:31] toll as to alarm the nation I just read
[1:13:34] a a a a a a study
[1:13:37] that there's a mental health crisis in
[1:13:41] this nation especially among the young
[1:13:43] people
[1:13:44] especially in particular among young
[1:13:46] girls
[1:13:47] and they said this they saw a sharp a
[1:13:50] very sharp increase I I could have
[1:13:53] brought it with me but I know I ain't
[1:13:54] got time so I didn't but amen I give all
[1:13:57] the uh statistics but they saw a very
[1:13:59] sharp increase of mental health uh uh uh
[1:14:03] uh decline around the year 2010 and they
[1:14:07] linked it to the to the uh the
[1:14:09] smartphone coming out and and they begin
[1:14:12] to tie this with social media and and
[1:14:15] and all these channels Outlets of social
[1:14:18] media and you think you know a thing
[1:14:20] that was supposed to make your life easy
[1:14:22] and connect everybody and you know and
[1:14:24] it's so good and you know and it should
[1:14:27] just bring joy and happiness amen but
[1:14:29] look what it's done amen and they showed
[1:14:31] this and amen this this country right
[1:14:34] now is in a mental health crisis
[1:14:39] suicide depression anxiety
[1:14:43] amen we we all these things are on a
[1:14:45] sharp increase and they keep going
[1:14:48] climbing higher and higher every year
[1:14:50] and it's not just in the young people
[1:14:52] it's in the adults
[1:14:57] the ram said
[1:14:59] when everybody ought to be happy
[1:15:01] with really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:15:04] millions are taking sedatives at night
[1:15:06] pep pills in the morning rushing the
[1:15:08] doctors entertaining institutions trying
[1:15:11] to drown out unknown fears by alcohol
[1:15:12] yet this age boasts of tremendous stores
[1:15:15] of worldly Goods but the people are less
[1:15:17] happy than ever this age uh boasts of
[1:15:20] spiritual attainments whether people are
[1:15:22] less sure of themselves than ever this
[1:15:24] age boasts a better moral values but is
[1:15:26] more corrupt than any age since the
[1:15:28] flood it talks about knowledge and
[1:15:30] science but it's fighting a losing
[1:15:31] battle in all fields for the human mind
[1:15:33] and souls and spirit cannot comprehend
[1:15:36] or keep abreast with all the changes
[1:15:38] that's come upon the Earth in one
[1:15:40] Generations we've gone all the way from
[1:15:41] a horse and buggy age to a space age and
[1:15:44] we're proud about it boastful about it
[1:15:46] but inside is a Dark Void Cavern that's
[1:15:49] crying out in torment and without a
[1:15:51] known reason men's hearts are failing
[1:15:53] them for fear the world is so darkened
[1:15:56] that this age could well be called the
[1:15:58] age of the neurotics
[1:16:00] it boasts but it can't back it up it
[1:16:03] cries peace but there is no peace it
[1:16:05] crossed uh amen that it has a great
[1:16:07] amplitude of all things but it keeps
[1:16:09] burning with a desire like an
[1:16:11] unsatisfied fire amen there is no peace
[1:16:16] saith my God for the wicked
[1:16:21] what's it all about brother Brown comes
[1:16:23] along and he he preaches letting off the
[1:16:25] pressure
[1:16:27] and he said what it is is a pressure
[1:16:31] pressing the people
[1:16:33] and by the way he said nobody escapes it
[1:16:36] the young the middle Asia oh I don't
[1:16:38] care who you are you're feeling the

[1:16:48] a place that a Believer can come and let
[1:16:50] the pressure off

[1:16:55] the doctors ain't got the answer
[1:16:57] and the psychiatrist ain't got that
[1:16:59] answer he says a matter of fact the
[1:17:01] psychiatrists are being treated by other
[1:17:03] psychiatrists
[1:17:05] even they don't have the answer but
[1:17:07] there's got to be an answer
[1:17:09] even he goes on in The Invisible union
[1:17:11] he said a few years ago if a mother or
[1:17:13] even them would have walked out on the
[1:17:15] streets the way some of these women walk
[1:17:17] out even even church members and and

[1:23:42] supernatural they knew it had to be
[1:23:44] something real had to be God
[1:23:48] but you know what they done instead of

[1:24:48] of God but they don't want it because of

[1:25:25] there's only one answer to this
[1:25:26] incentive it's the mind of Christ

[1:30:14] you amen that the message needs to be
[1:30:16] updated

[1:30:24] come on Church listen to this Prophet
[1:30:27] amen he talks about things that make
[1:30:29] more sense in 2023 than it did in 1965.

[1:30:37] it don't need no update
[1:30:40] your Revelation is what needs updated
[1:30:44] trying to look back animals paint on
[1:30:46] their face knowing that these things are
[1:30:48] predicted to happen things that will

[1:30:59] amen and that the mental condition of

[1:31:27] this you're not living in the feet age
[1:31:31] the church has moved up
[1:31:33] amen moved all the way up brother around
[1:31:35] bring it all the way up to the tongues
[1:31:37] and Pentecost moved all the way up to
[1:31:39] the eyes I see a prophet
[1:31:41] how many believe this is true but above
[1:31:43] them knives there's no more moving parts
[1:31:45] amen only the intelligence
[1:31:47] itself the mind
[1:31:50] amen and then he says we have no
[1:31:52] intelligence of Our Own
[1:31:54] hallelujah amen listen amen was he tying
[1:31:58] this into the headship of Christ coming
[1:32:00] down in the body
[1:32:03] you're living in that age
[1:32:09] now we're beginning to see
[1:32:11] what was in God's mind
[1:32:15] brother Brown was saying Christ's a
[1:32:17] mystery in the back part
[1:32:19] of God's mind
[1:32:22] a hidden Mystery
[1:32:24] in the back part
[1:32:26] friends
[1:32:27] I don't know if you know how blessed you
[1:32:29] are
[1:32:29] when you begin to hear this message
[1:32:32] you're not hearing the thoughts of a man
[1:32:34] let me tell you I know the devil hates
[1:32:36] this but I'm gonna say it tonight amen a
[1:32:39] prophet when a word Prophet amen this
[1:32:41] Prophet that we're following is a word
[1:32:43] prophet
[1:32:44] this is not a gift of Prophecy
[1:32:47] this is not your common Pentecostal
[1:32:50] prophet
[1:32:51] amen this is a word Prophet a
[1:32:53] dispensational prophet
[1:32:55] amen and we're in a word Prophet begins
[1:32:58] to speak it is not God inspiring that
[1:33:01] man's mind
[1:33:03] or inspiring his thoughts
[1:33:05] it's God completely bypassing his mind
[1:33:08] altogether and the mind of God is being
[1:33:11] expressed to the mouth of a man
[1:33:16] Hallelujah let me tell you some church
[1:33:18] this message didn't come out of
[1:33:20] Jeffersonville it didn't come out of
[1:33:22] Kentucky it's not the thoughts of
[1:33:24] William Bradham this comes from the
[1:33:25] might of God hallelujah amen that's why
[1:33:29] I can stand as a preacher and tell you
[1:33:31] this and I as Paul said we have the mind
[1:33:35] of Christ
[1:33:37] hallelujah amen we know what God had in
[1:33:42] his mind
[1:33:44] a prophet has gone to reveal to us the
[1:33:48] very mind of God
[1:33:49] [Music]
[1:33:52] watch what he said speaking of
[1:33:54] discernment he said that's not mind
[1:33:56] reading it's not psychology I'll Grant
[1:33:59] you this is psychology in this way
[1:34:01] pasaki means your course of mind it's
[1:34:04] the mind of Christ
[1:34:06] and a human being has had a privilege to
[1:34:09] enter in
[1:34:10] and know the mind of Christ he said
[1:34:13] Hallelujah and I say hallelujah tonight
[1:34:18] amen how many scratch you had the
[1:34:20] privilege to enter in
[1:34:23] now
[1:34:24] I know I got to be careful in my time
[1:34:26] but am I right so far
[1:34:30] I'm just now where I want to be
[1:34:32] spend a lot of time getting here didn't
[1:34:34] I but I'm just where I want to be right
[1:34:35] now
[1:34:36] even because of Paul says let
[1:34:39] this mind be in you
[1:34:42] Amen in other words amen that word means
[1:34:45] don't prevent
[1:34:47] don't hinder
[1:34:48] remove all obstacles
[1:34:52] now brother Brown because the law says
[1:34:54] you can't have his mind in your mind at
[1:34:56] the same time
[1:34:59] so the only way you're gonna have to
[1:35:00] mind to Christ is you got to lose your
[1:35:02] mind
[1:35:04] come on friends you gotta lay down your
[1:35:07] thinking you gotta Surrender Your Ideas
[1:35:10] you got to forget about your thoughts
[1:35:14] let this man
[1:35:16] the Amplified Bible says it this way
[1:35:19] have this same attitude
[1:35:21] in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus
[1:35:25] I like that
[1:35:26] have the same attitude
[1:35:29] that Jesus Christ had
[1:35:31] even what was it amen but being in the
[1:35:34] form of God
[1:35:35] and not robbery
[1:35:37] to be equal with God
[1:35:41] Jesus was not taking anything away from
[1:35:44] God
[1:35:47] to be equal with him
[1:35:49] can I tell you this way he was not
[1:35:51] stealing a position that didn't belong
[1:35:54] to him
[1:35:56] he said he was not he meant taking
[1:35:58] something amen that was not rightfully
[1:36:00] his
[1:36:01] he thought in our robbery to be equal
[1:36:04] with God and now Apostle Paul says let
[1:36:07] this man be in you
[1:36:11] Hallelujah
[1:36:12] Brother Brad said let's go beyond our
[1:36:14] own thinking let's go by the thinking of
[1:36:17] God and the Bible says let this mind
[1:36:19] that was in Christ be in you so think
[1:36:21] his thoughts
[1:36:23] not our own thinking because most of the
[1:36:25] time we're wrong
[1:36:29] how many can say Amen to that
[1:36:32] brother Brown said when you think you
[1:36:33] got it all figured out you're wrong
[1:36:36] so he says let's think his thoughts
[1:36:39] another place he says people say them
[1:36:41] people are crazy the reason are they are
[1:36:44] is they ain't got the mind of the world
[1:36:46] anymore they got the mind of Christ
[1:36:50] Hallelujah and when you have the mind of
[1:36:52] Christ the world's going to call you
[1:36:54] crazy
[1:36:57] watch what brother Brown says Identify
[1:36:59] Masterpiece I'm now identified in the
[1:37:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost not something
[1:37:04] out there here it's on the streets
[1:37:06] something 40 years ago I have it right
[1:37:07] now and the glory of power of God and
[1:37:10] forgiveness of sins I see him heal the
[1:37:12] sick open up blinded eyes I see them
[1:37:14] foretell things and read hearts of the
[1:37:15] people I'm identify with him in his
[1:37:18] ministry at this day glory to God I'm
[1:37:20] identifying with him for the Deliverance
[1:37:22] in the last days I trust to be a part of
[1:37:24] that great bride that's coming some of
[1:37:27] these days no matter what the world may
[1:37:28] say

[1:37:43] born there I want to stay there I'll
[1:37:45] always be there because God placed me

[1:39:31] Liberty right here amen because I feel
[1:39:32] like preaching in this area and because
[1:39:34] I got to think about if there's a bunch

[1:40:06] come on friends I'm not trying to even
[1:40:08] make this a beautiful picture for you
[1:40:10] and say they're doing a good thing
[1:40:11] they're they're controlled by a
[1:40:14] perverted devil
[1:40:16] and that perverted devil has such a
[1:40:19] power over them amen until they don't
[1:40:21] care what nobody else thinks
[1:40:24] they'll ignore their own feelings
[1:40:28] they'll ignore amen what they see and
[1:40:31] everything else and identify themselves
[1:40:33] as something completely different from
[1:40:36] what they are
[1:40:37] and I got the thing about that and I
[1:40:39] thought my goodness if a perverted devil
[1:40:41] could so take over a mine until they
[1:40:44] could get such a control over a person
[1:40:46] until they don't care amen what somebody
[1:40:48] says about them how they look how crazy

[1:40:53] they'll even deny what they see in their
[1:40:56] own mirror I say I'll tell you this
[1:40:58] tonight amen I don't care what the world
[1:41:00] thinks and I don't care how I feel
[1:41:06] Hallelujah I don't care how I feel I
[1:41:09] don't care what I see I identify myself
[1:41:13] as a Holy Ghost Field in time message
[1:41:17] believer
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:24] amen can identify themselves as another
[1:41:27] gender and identify themselves as an
[1:41:29] animal or whatever more let them do what
[1:41:32] they want to do even behind identify
[1:41:35] myself with the message of my thoughtful
[1:41:38] I I did it by myself as a son of God
[1:41:44] Hallelujah you say but brother I don't
[1:41:46] feel like it or even what's that got to
[1:41:49] do with it
[1:41:53] deny your feelings
[1:41:57] Hallelujah look past the humanity
[1:42:01] and see the deity
[1:42:08] Hallelujah
[1:42:13] the man said this is a direct statement
[1:42:16] the mind of Christ is to be in the
[1:42:19] church
[1:42:22] souls in prison now he says the first
[1:42:24] nature is gone
[1:42:25] we not we we now and now we are the
[1:42:29] nature of him he lives in us we don't do
[1:42:33] our own will we do his will we don't
[1:42:36] think our own thoughts
[1:42:38] the mind is what thinks the mind that
[1:42:40] was in Christ Jesus is in every believer
[1:42:45] Hallelujah he said there's a soul that's
[1:42:49] what we're speaking of that's the part
[1:42:51] I'm thinking of now amen that's within
[1:42:53] us
[1:42:54] watch this in the word became flesh
[1:42:58] so powerful here every word in the Bible
[1:43:01] is God's thoughts laid in a seed form
[1:43:05] that if revealed into the human being
[1:43:08] and spoke by the same thought that
[1:43:12] materialized the Bible will bring to
[1:43:14] pass see what I mean how powerful could
[1:43:16] the church be the Bible said let this
[1:43:18] man that will be in you that was in
[1:43:20] Christ Jesus amen as a man thinking in
[1:43:22] his heart so is he now your thoughts see
[1:43:25] if they become expression like God said
[1:43:27] let there be a world before it could be
[1:43:29] a word it had to be a thought so then in
[1:43:31] God and creation created the world by
[1:43:34] his thoughts first then spoke and the
[1:43:36] thought expressed became material do you
[1:43:39] see what I mean
[1:43:40] now if that same spirit that said let
[1:43:42] there be light and there was light amen
[1:43:45] could say let there be no cancer it'll
[1:43:47] be gone let blind eyes be open it'll be
[1:43:50] so he said that was Jesus wait a minute
[1:43:53] he said have faith in God for verily I
[1:43:56] say unto you if you shall say to this
[1:43:59] mountain be moved and pluck up and cast
[1:44:01] and sea and don't doubt in your heart
[1:44:02] but believe what you said what kind of
[1:44:04] past then whatever things you said amen
[1:44:06] you'll have is that right what power has
[1:44:09] been given to the church
[1:44:11] [Applause]
[1:44:13] now you can express about mental
[1:44:15] conception but if it becomes a real
[1:44:16] revelation
[1:44:18] even then you see it before it happened
[1:44:20] it's expressed in word form and the word
[1:44:22] takes a hold and becomes material if
[1:44:25] your heart and mind is so in filled with
[1:44:27] God's spirit until your thoughts here's
[1:44:29] the key right here friends until your
[1:44:30] thoughts become his thoughts
[1:44:33] amen then there you are when you're mine
[1:44:35] you're leading your guiding becomes a
[1:44:37] direct place or a direct inspiration of
[1:44:39] the Holy Spirit moving your mortal being
[1:44:41] what kind of people should we be if the
[1:44:43] very Holy Spirit has so embodied
[1:44:45] empowered you amen you don't even use
[1:44:47] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[1:44:49] mind you don't use your own opinion but
[1:44:52] the holy spirit is so built you until
[1:44:53] your thoughts and being is God's spirit
[1:44:56] expressing itself they're you
[1:44:59] what kind of people would we be
[1:45:04] oh he says it Branham Tabernacle is so
[1:45:06] filled with the presence of God why you
[1:45:08] didn't even use your own mind you didn't
[1:45:10] use your own thoughts didn't have no
[1:45:12] alternative of your own let's just led
[1:45:15] by the spirit
[1:45:16] and I love this part of right here I
[1:45:18] know you Brothers have used it many
[1:45:20] times when the human element goes out
[1:45:22] the spirit of God fills that vacancy
[1:45:25] when you empty yourself amen then amen
[1:45:28] will be when the church in its power of
[1:45:31] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:32] Christ will walk in his steps in his
[1:45:35] power in his thoughts in his being in
[1:45:37] his moving
[1:45:39] then your thoughts will become words and
[1:45:43] words will become material

[1:45:52] when the church will be so wrapped in
[1:45:54] Christ
[1:45:55] amen the Holy Spirit mankind will be
[1:45:58] away from themselves that they don't see
[1:46:00] themselves

[1:46:20] human beings by the Holy Spirit

[1:46:33] Earth

[1:46:39] he says I'm talking about the one that
[1:46:42] stood on the great invisible platform
[1:46:45] and spoke the word
[1:46:48] and there was nothing there
[1:46:53] Hallelujah

[1:51:00] Hallelujah
[1:51:03] it's in you
[1:51:06] it's in you
[1:51:08] being in a form of God
[1:51:11] who being in the form of God
[1:51:13] what's brother been taking he says see
[1:51:15] he humbled himself took on the form
[1:51:18] a certain brother Brown breaks into it
[1:51:19] said God and morphacy His God he takes
[1:51:22] and goes into that that Greek word
[1:51:25] and begin to break it down God changing
[1:51:28] his form
[1:51:31] what is he doing and that word in the
[1:51:34] Greek means the form by which a person
[1:51:35] or thing strikes the vision
[1:51:37] Mark 16 when Jesus was welcome with the
[1:51:40] two on the road to Emmaus he said the
[1:51:42] Bible says he appeared unto them in
[1:51:44] another form
[1:51:47] brother Brown comes along in the
[1:51:48] unveiling of God oh
[1:51:50] unveiling of God
[1:51:53] church I'm telling you you're living in
[1:51:54] the age not of the veiling
[1:51:57] but the unveiling
[1:52:00] of God and a prophets pulling a veil
[1:52:02] back off of God and he says look it's
[1:52:05] God in more faith he's changing his mask
[1:52:08] he's changing his form
[1:52:12] and he breaks into Philippians 2 and he
[1:52:14] says see he emptied himself
[1:52:18] but brother grandma gives a thought show
[1:52:19] us amen he emptied himself he's another
[1:52:22] way we think
[1:52:25] not amen but he but he he changed his
[1:52:30] form
[1:52:33] can I can I tell it to you in a way
[1:52:35] maybe help you understand because
[1:52:36] sometimes you get in your mind all that
[1:52:38] was in God he poured into Christ right
[1:52:41] this is truth all that was in Christ
[1:52:43] listen now all
[1:52:46] all that was in God he poured into
[1:52:50] Christ
[1:52:51] all that was in Christ he poured into
[1:52:53] the church
[1:52:57] but but but sometimes we get in our mind
[1:52:59] like we take three glasses and sit up
[1:53:01] here
[1:53:02] and we take and we got one full and two
[1:53:04] empty
[1:53:05] we think this one's God right the full
[1:53:07] one
[1:53:08] and we pour it all into the second one
[1:53:10] now Christ is full and God's empty
[1:53:15] president said that you understand
[1:53:17] brother that's what brother Brown said
[1:53:19] not the way you not the way we think
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:22] but he emptied himself
[1:53:30] I'm on church amen God in Christ didn't
[1:53:34] leave God empty
[1:53:39] and let me say this and he was no less
[1:53:42] God
[1:53:44] in Jesus Christ
[1:53:46] that he wasn't a pillar of Fire
[1:53:50] how many can say Amen to that
[1:53:52] he took on flesh he become a man but God
[1:53:57] was no less God in the man Christ Jesus
[1:54:01] than he was as an eternal God in heaven
[1:54:04] [Applause]
[1:54:05] you with me so far I hope you can take
[1:54:08] the next part of it and he's no less God
[1:54:10] in you
[1:54:13] Hallelujah I said he's no less God in
[1:54:16] you
[1:54:17] that he was in Christ
[1:54:21] Hallelujah he said well wait a minute
[1:54:23] the fullness of God is not in me you're
[1:54:25] right on that point amen we don't have
[1:54:28] the quantity but we got the same
[1:54:30] quantity or our quality rather amen we
[1:54:33] got the same life
[1:54:35] so now I'm going to ask you this
[1:54:37] question how much of the Holy Ghost how
[1:54:40] much of Zoe life how much of eternal
[1:54:43] life does it take to be an overcomer
[1:54:48] how much of the life of God does it take
[1:54:50] to defeat the enemy
[1:54:54] how much
[1:54:56] I'll tell you this where the Prophet
[1:54:57] said it if you got a spoonful
[1:55:01] of the ocean everything that's in that
[1:55:04] ocean
[1:55:07] Hallelujah everything that's another is
[1:55:11] in that spoon
[1:55:13] come on church and I want to tell you
[1:55:15] amen Christ in you it's no less
[1:55:19] you are not taken away from him
[1:55:22] and him being in you don't leave him
[1:55:25] empty
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:27] I wish I had time to preach amen because
[1:55:29] I'm telling you this in our church amen
[1:55:32] God in Christ didn't leave God empty and
[1:55:34] Christ in you did leave Christ empty
[1:55:38] the Holy Ghost can be in this building
[1:55:40] in this service in your heart
[1:55:44] and you still have a high priest
[1:55:47] at the right hand of God make an
[1:55:49] intercession on your behalf I know the
[1:55:52] devil even don't like you to understand
[1:55:54] that because he's trying to say oh if
[1:55:56] Christ is here he can't be there or if
[1:55:58] God is here he can't be there well I
[1:56:00] just want to tell the devil so we ain't
[1:56:01] talking about a man and we ain't talking
[1:56:03] about a God we made we're talking about
[1:56:05] the Eternal Supreme and him
[1:56:09] self-existing light he can be here all
[1:56:12] places at all times and do anything now
[1:56:15] he wants to do
[1:56:18] anytime he wants to do it
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:29] God changing his form changing his mask
[1:56:32] emptying himself see
[1:56:35] the prophecy the perfect image
[1:56:37] of the god man
[1:56:39] God and morphe
[1:56:41] Hallelujah
[1:56:42] he changed from the supernatural to the
[1:56:45] vision
[1:56:47] and the vision was projected into the
[1:56:49] image
[1:56:50] and the image was smitten
[1:56:52] so that the supernatural could taste the
[1:56:54] feeling of death it was God's perfect
[1:56:57] Masterpiece then in who's been at this
[1:56:59] Melchizedek he said God and morphe mask
[1:57:01] in the pillar of fire god and more faith
[1:57:03] in a man called Jesus God and morphe in
[1:57:06] his church
[1:57:09] God With Us
[1:57:12] where he says God above us Pillar of
[1:57:15] Fire God With Us Jesus Christ God in us
[1:57:20] hallelujah amen what is it they're
[1:57:22] condescending God up there holy amen no
[1:57:25] one could touch him he set up on the
[1:57:27] mount even if an animal touched him out
[1:57:28] had to die and then God came down and
[1:57:32] changed his tent
[1:57:34] and come down and live with us become
[1:57:37] one of us and we held him he was that
[1:57:39] well the Bible says amen that was God
[1:57:41] above us God With Us Now is God in us
[1:57:43] the Holy Spirit not a third person the
[1:57:46] same person
[1:57:47] God came down and become flesh and died
[1:57:49] to death in Christ
[1:57:51] so that he could clean the church
[1:57:54] in order to get in it
[1:57:58] Hallelujah
[1:57:59] listen friends amen the home mystery the
[1:58:03] Revelation the whole mystery is that
[1:58:04] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:58:07] it's all right he become a man in Jesus
[1:58:09] Christ to do what Amen to do the work of
[1:58:11] a kinsman redeemer amen not just so he
[1:58:13] could live in that man only come on
[1:58:16] Friends he wanted to get in you
[1:58:19] he wanted to get in me amen he wanted to
[1:58:22] live in his church
[1:58:23] amen he wanted to come amen not just be
[1:58:26] with us amen he even taught his
[1:58:28] disciples one day he said it's expedient
[1:58:30] for you that I go because if I don't go
[1:58:33] the comforter cannot come
[1:58:36] hallelujah amen and what was he telling
[1:58:39] him he was saying it's been good to be
[1:58:40] with you I've loved being with you amen
[1:58:43] but I'm not satisfied just being with
[1:58:46] you I want to get in here
[1:58:49] because there were certain scriptures
[1:58:51] that could not be fulfilled under the
[1:58:54] revelation of Emmanuel God With Us
[1:58:59] listen friends are you are you following
[1:59:01] what I'm saying
[1:59:02] there was a certain part of the word
[1:59:04] that could only be fulfilled when he got
[1:59:08] in you
[1:59:14] is in morphe
[1:59:16] president said changing his form
[1:59:19] that word actually means
[1:59:21] the form
[1:59:22] or the outward expression
[1:59:25] that embodies
[1:59:27] the essential inner substance that the
[1:59:30] form is uh so that the form another
[1:59:33] watch this I'm going to try to read it
[1:59:36] the right way the form or outward
[1:59:39] expression
[1:59:40] that embodies the essential inner
[1:59:42] substance so that the form
[1:59:45] is in complete Harmony
[1:59:50] with the Inner Essence
[1:59:55] amen the form or outward expression
[1:59:59] that embodies the essential inner
[2:00:01] substance so that the form is in
[2:00:04] complete harmony with the Inner Essence
[2:00:09] and then a prophet under the Holy Spirit
[2:00:12] picks up his pen and gives a ride and
[2:00:14] the Holy Spirit begins to say notice the
[2:00:16] harmony between the father and the son
[2:00:19] Jesus never did anything until it was
[2:00:21] first showed him by the father Saint
[2:00:22] John 5 19. this harmony now is to exist
[2:00:26] between the groom and his bride he shows
[2:00:29] her his Word of Life she receives it she
[2:00:31] never doubts it therefore nothing can
[2:00:34] harm her not even death first the sea be
[2:00:36] planted and be watered it will rise up
[2:00:38] again here is the secret the word is in
[2:00:41] the bride Hallelujah as it was in Mary
[2:00:44] the bride has the mind of Christ
[2:00:48] where she knows what he wants done with
[2:00:51] the word
[2:00:52] Hallelujah even she performs the command
[2:00:55] of the word in his name for she has thus
[2:00:58] saith the Lord
[2:01:00] you believe it those in the bride were
[2:01:02] holy they're his will
[2:01:04] no one can make them do otherwise
[2:01:09] oh you ought to shout on that a little
[2:01:10] while no one even if you're a part of
[2:01:13] that bride you had the bra the mind of
[2:01:16] Christ amen you have thus said the Lord
[2:01:18] even no one can make you do otherwise
[2:01:24] hallelujah amen they have to say the
[2:01:27] Lord that keeps steal they know it has
[2:01:29] to be God in them doing the work
[2:01:34] fulfilling his own word
[2:01:36] amen he did not complete all his work
[2:01:38] the work that he had to do while he was
[2:01:40] here in his Earthly Ministry was so the
[2:01:42] prophet of God what did he say he is
[2:01:44] working now in
[2:01:45] and through
[2:01:48] the bride
[2:01:50] Hallelujah he is now working in and
[2:01:53] through the bride
[2:01:56] Christ in you
[2:01:59] is that right
[2:02:00] it's Christ in you

[2:02:05] you've come to a higher thought
[2:02:08] you come to you've come to listen amen
[2:02:11] you see amen as a world has come to a
[2:02:13] climax
[2:02:15] it's building up in this great age of
[2:02:17] information great age of knowledge great
[2:02:20] age of scientific achievement but watch
[2:02:22] what brother Brown shows and the message
[2:02:24] countdown he said it always runs in a
[2:02:26] parallel is that right amen and he says
[2:02:30] for every achievement amen forever see
[2:02:32] what man is doing on this side God has
[2:02:34] an achievement over here with the church
[2:02:37] are you are you following me hey man and
[2:02:40] I'm just gonna close I'm closing so
[2:02:42] don't get nervous amen but the prophet
[2:02:43] of God showing you this amen he's
[2:02:45] showing you in the how that amen he said
[2:02:48] what brought us to this place he said
[2:02:50] man amen that would not take no for an
[2:02:53] answer
[2:02:55] amen they moved out into the Realms of
[2:02:57] the unknown they broke into amen into
[2:03:01] and because amen they caught a vision of
[2:03:03] something and they knew it was possible
[2:03:07] and one man would follow another man's
[2:03:09] work and he would build on that and he
[2:03:12] would move it to a higher level amen is
[2:03:14] that are you following what is and
[2:03:15] brother Brown's bringing it through and
[2:03:16] listen I'm just going to say this and I
[2:03:18] amen look how long the world went
[2:03:21] look how at me years of time of the Dark
[2:03:24] Ages with very very little achievements
[2:03:28] very little changes in the scientific
[2:03:30] Realms or any any you know there was so
[2:03:33] little that was accomplished but then
[2:03:35] all of a sudden it began to change and
[2:03:38] it began to move out of the eight the
[2:03:40] Dark Ages into what they call the age of
[2:03:42] Discovery amen and come on down amen and
[2:03:45] Men begin to rise up amen great
[2:03:47] scientists amen and Men amen they begin
[2:03:49] to say things like the world Amen the
[2:03:52] the the the the universe and our system

[2:03:56] everything ain't worth rotating around
[2:03:58] the earth amen is going around the Sun
[2:04:00] and you know what they call them
[2:04:01] Heretics
[2:04:03] they that there was all kind of
[2:04:05] opposition there's all kind of people
[2:04:07] standing there telling amen quit saying
[2:04:09] that stuff ain't gonna quit pre you know
[2:04:11] quit preaching that nonsense hey man
[2:04:14] quit quit writing them kind of uh books
[2:04:16] and amen all these kind of things quit
[2:04:18] talking about that amen listen that goes
[2:04:20] against our theology that goes against
[2:04:21] our thinking listen for instance men
[2:04:23] like Galileo hey man we're gonna make
[2:04:26] these bold statements amen we're tried
[2:04:28] as Heretics
[2:04:30] by the Catholic Church
[2:04:33] and at the same time
[2:04:35] that thing that that's going on
[2:04:38] Luther Rises up
[2:04:40] and at the same time they invent a
[2:04:42] printing press
[2:04:47] you think that's all by an accident
[2:04:49] no brother Brown comes the opening of
[2:04:51] the seals tells us there was an
[2:04:53] anointing released
[2:04:56] amen it was a it was a it was a very
[2:04:58] wisdom of man
[2:05:00] because that anointing of a man the very
[2:05:02] and it was released upon the Earth and
[2:05:05] they began to build
[2:05:06] amen and they begin to make great
[2:05:08] achievements amen and then they moved
[2:05:11] from a horse and buggy to an automobile
[2:05:16] and that one the end of it ain't been
[2:05:18] moving up into Wesley's age now
[2:05:21] because every natural achievement has a
[2:05:23] spiritual achievement all right is that
[2:05:25] right
[2:05:26] amen and then amen from that amen they
[2:05:29] begin to let people begin to say it's
[2:05:32] possible for a man to fly there was all
[2:05:34] kind of people said it'll never happen
[2:05:35] in a thousand years it won't happen
[2:05:37] there was preachers preaching from their
[2:05:40] poopists even men will never fly that is
[2:05:43] something reserved for the angels of
[2:05:44] them
[2:05:46] I'm not making that up that's actually
[2:05:48] what they were saying
[2:05:50] but but I heard brother Wayne told me
[2:05:52] something that Isaac found he found a
[2:05:54] statement that one of the Wright
[2:05:56] Brothers come up with and he wrote this
[2:05:58] letter is trying to get some support or
[2:06:00] something I believe it was and and he
[2:06:02] said I'm afflicted
[2:06:04] and my Affliction is getting worse and I
[2:06:07] fear there's no cure for the Affliction
[2:06:09] that I have and he begins to make this
[2:06:11] statement I'm paraphrasing somewhat but
[2:06:13] he said I'm Afflicted with the belief
[2:06:14] that it's possible for man to fly
[2:06:18] and he said I have fear that amen my
[2:06:20] Affliction if is going to continue to
[2:06:22] grow worse until it takes over amen all
[2:06:24] uh I'm gonna lose everything I got my
[2:06:27] finances everything amen's gonna amen be
[2:06:29] lost to this affliction
[2:06:31] brother man said they refused to take no
[2:06:34] for an answer
[2:06:36] and you know what they did amen they saw
[2:06:38] the possibilities because they began to
[2:06:40] study what somebody else said
[2:06:44] but I'm going to tell you something they
[2:06:46] didn't sit around their house Brother
[2:06:47] Ray and write essays and and they you
[2:06:49] know they study what somebody else's and
[2:06:51] they just said man this is so good and
[2:06:52] come up with formulas and put things
[2:06:54] together no amen they didn't sit on
[2:06:56] their couch and and put things together
[2:06:58] and think man that's beautiful amen I
[2:07:00] believe it might be possible one day
[2:07:01] somebody's gonna pick this up amen no
[2:07:03] amen they took the things they studied
[2:07:05] amen and they started putting things
[2:07:07] together and they started building
[2:07:09] things and they went out there and they
[2:07:11] started trying it
[2:07:13] come on friends and you know what amen
[2:07:16] they had a lot of failures and there was
[2:07:18] a lot of obstacles and there's a lot of
[2:07:20] people saying it'll never happen amen
[2:07:22] but it didn't stop them
[2:07:26] Hallelujah and we moved into an airplane
[2:07:29] age amen and at the same time that the
[2:07:32] Wright brothers is having a successful
[2:07:34] flag even the Holy Ghost it's fallen on
[2:07:37] Azusa Street in 1906 and we're moving
[2:07:39] into an airplane age but that ain't the
[2:07:41] end of the story because we didn't stay
[2:07:44] there no we moved there to an astronaut
[2:07:46] age
[2:07:47] Hallelujah but forever natural
[2:07:49] achievement there's a spiritual
[2:07:51] achievement
[2:07:54] [Applause]
[2:07:55] and and the scientific Minds kept
[2:07:58] getting greater and greater until we had
[2:08:00] an Einstein
[2:08:02] is that right
[2:08:04] no the greatest scientific mind of all
[2:08:08] times
[2:08:10] and and he come up with even you know
[2:08:13] his his uh equations and formula they're
[2:08:17] still being in use right now today
[2:08:19] breakthrough
[2:08:22] at the same time that there was a an
[2:08:24] Einstein there was another spiritual
[2:08:27] achievement y'all were gonna call me
[2:08:28] crazy
[2:08:30] it's all right because I lost my mind
[2:08:31] you said I done told you
[2:08:34] but this assures there was a natural
[2:08:36] Einstein there was a spiritual Einstein
[2:08:41] that God a spiritual scientists
[2:08:45] Hallelujah and he began to break into
[2:08:49] what what was would have been uh it
[2:08:52] would have been impossible in Luther's
[2:08:55] age it was impossible in Wesley's age it
[2:08:58] was impossible in Pentecost
[2:09:01] hallelujah amen but now amen has moved
[2:09:06] up into the very intelligence of Christ
[2:09:07] fancy you see what I'm saying amen the
[2:09:10] world is out of Pinnacle of a scientific
[2:09:12] age
[2:09:14] amen this is the age of Science and of
[2:09:17] intellect and and great uh
[2:09:19] understandings
[2:09:21] but for every natural achievement
[2:09:23] there's a spiritual achievement
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:27] and you know what they're saying right
[2:09:28] now
[2:09:30] right now
[2:09:31] they're saying that immortality
[2:09:34] is in the Realms of possibility
[2:09:38] right now
[2:09:39] they're saying that any any person born
[2:09:43] after I believe if I'm not mistaken
[2:09:46] around the in the years of maybe 1970 or
[2:09:49] somewhere around in there
[2:09:51] see
[2:09:53] could live could be immortal
[2:09:57] one man wrote and he's a very renowned
[2:10:01] uh scientists that is well known for
[2:10:03] making predictions that come to pass and
[2:10:06] he said he said it this way he said it
[2:10:08] would be in the Realms of possibility
[2:10:10] in the next seven years
[2:10:13] for man to reach immortality but you
[2:10:16] know what they also have found this they
[2:10:19] said these bodies that we live in
[2:10:22] that they have an absolute
[2:10:26] um you know they're they're never lived
[2:10:28] forever we can't live forever in these
[2:10:30] bodies
[2:10:31] he said with all medical science and all
[2:10:34] the achievements and all the everything
[2:10:36] that they could do for you in this body
[2:10:37] they said even you know maybe
[2:10:41] over time we could stretch it out 150
[2:10:44] years Man live 150 years old but
[2:10:46] eventually this body is going to give
[2:10:49] out it's going to die it's going to
[2:10:50] frame so even they begin to realize
[2:10:52] they're looking for immortality but they
[2:10:55] know you can't do it in the body you're
[2:10:56] in now
[2:10:59] so they've went to artificial
[2:11:01] intelligence
[2:11:03] and they say now immortality is in the
[2:11:05] Realms of possibility in the next seven
[2:11:07] years by artificial intelligence
[2:11:10] in other words by another intelligence
[2:11:14] there's going to be a a a the real the
[2:11:17] the possibility of immortality is going
[2:11:20] to come
[2:11:24] Hallelujah
[2:11:25] amen and then I got to think about this
[2:11:28] and you know running in the parallel of
[2:11:31] what brother Brown taught us in the
[2:11:32] message countdown for every natural
[2:11:33] achievement there's a spiritual
[2:11:35] achievement and when man gets this high
[2:11:37] God is real raising a church up higher
[2:11:41] Hallelujah listen we are not a laodicean
[2:11:45] church
[2:11:46] we are not in the Pentecostal age
[2:11:50] we're in an astronaut age
[2:11:52] hallelujah we're not an airplane up and
[2:11:55] down and up and down and up and down
[2:11:57] you're in a space shuttle
[2:12:00] Hallelujah a greater power a greater
[2:12:04] amen amen do you understand what I'm
[2:12:06] preaching to you amen and now a prophet
[2:12:08] is sitting there telling you for every
[2:12:10] natural achievement it was a spiritual
[2:12:12] achievement and I'm just telling you
[2:12:13] amen that they are saying within the
[2:12:16] next seven years man could be immortal I
[2:12:19] say brother if they're that close in the
[2:12:22] scientific Realms how close are we
[2:12:24] tonight amen and those reels are the
[2:12:27] Supernatural and it won't be artificial
[2:12:29] intelligence it'll be the mind of Christ
[2:12:34] Hallelujah the very intelligence of God
[2:12:37] coming down to the church it's gonna
[2:12:39] change and Mortal bodies
[2:12:43] Hallelujah and that's mortal will put on
[2:12:46] immortality
[2:12:48] and this corruption will but on
[2:12:50] incorruption
[2:12:52] Hallelujah and there's some of you amen
[2:12:55] I believe I'm saying amen I'm going to
[2:12:57] say it because I believe it with
[2:12:58] everything within me there's people in
[2:13:00] this building right now that will never
[2:13:03] taste death
[2:13:06] hallelujah amen there is people sitting
[2:13:10] right here amen that will never die amen
[2:13:13] but will be changed in a moment in a
[2:13:15] twinkling of an eye cause Paul said we
[2:13:18] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[2:13:21] changed
[2:13:23] hallelujah amen and the mind is here to
[2:13:27] achieve it
[2:13:29] do you believe it
[2:13:30] let this mind be in you
[2:13:33] that was in Christ Jesus it'll stay near
[2:13:34] our feet tonight at the musicians would
