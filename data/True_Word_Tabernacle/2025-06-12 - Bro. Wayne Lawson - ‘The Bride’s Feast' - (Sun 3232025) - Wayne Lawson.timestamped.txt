[5:58] [Music]
[6:03] Bless his holy
[6:10] name.
[6:15] Hallelujah. Isn't he worthy of praise
[6:17] this morning? Amen. That we would bless
[6:20] his name. Amen. What a what a powerful
[6:23] name, the name of Jesus. Amen. And it's
[6:26] certainly good to see everyone here on a
[6:28] Sunday morning. And Amen. What a a
[6:30] tremendous blessing to come into such an
[6:32] atmosphere. Amen. We certainly believe
[6:35] that it is a feast, a feast with Christ.
[6:38] Amen. And we're um we're greatly
[6:40] honored. Amen. For his mercy that he has
[6:43] shown us to be able to see the
[6:46] revelation of the age, man. There's a
[6:48] there's a revival happening. And the
[6:50] prophet said the world don't know
[6:52] nothing about it.
[6:54] They're blind to seeing it. But you and
[6:57] I by grace Amen. have able to feed upon
[7:00] it by his mercies. Amen. Amen. So, we
[7:04] just want to take a moment this morning.
[7:07] We want to go into the word of the Lord.
[7:08] And just before we do, let's just bow
[7:11] our hearts in a word of prayer. Heavenly
[7:13] Father, we thank you today for the grace
[7:15] that you have given, for the mercy to be
[7:17] here in your house, Lord, as your
[7:20] children gather in, Lord. Father, within
[7:23] the gates, Lord, I I pray this morning
[7:26] that your grace would, Lord, give us
[7:29] mercy. And Lord, as we look upon your
[7:31] children, and we feel a whole lot like
[7:34] that little boy, he just had a couple
[7:37] pieces of fish and a loaf of bread,
[7:40] Lord,
[7:42] but you took it in your hands and you
[7:43] fed the multitudes. And we pray this
[7:46] morning that you would take the things
[7:48] that we have here. And Lord, we pray
[7:51] that you would feed the multitudes. May
[7:53] May you feed them, Lord. Feed them from
[7:55] the young to the old. And Lord, only you
[7:58] could take a word and and feed the
[8:01] youngest to the eldest, Lord.
[8:04] And I pray this morning that you would
[8:06] give us that grace. And as we would eat,
[8:08] Lord, that healing would come into the
[8:10] body, forgiveness of sins,
[8:14] Lord, the forgiving of one another, that
[8:17] it would be a feast of your word, but a
[8:19] feast of love. Father, we ask you for
[8:22] your mercy this morning upon this
[8:24] meeting. Now, take it in your hands,
[8:26] Father, in Jesus name. Amen and amen.
[8:31] And God bless you. If you have your
[8:33] Bibles today, we'd like to go into the
[8:35] book of Revelations, the 10th chapter,
[8:38] and we'll be reading the seventh down to
[8:40] the 11th verse, and also Matthew 4 and
[8:42] verse4. Amen. Certainly good to have
[8:45] brother Jonathan home this morning. He
[8:47] since uh since he's become a part of us.
[8:50] He's staying going a lot of these Sunday
[8:51] mornings. Lord is really using him and
[8:54] Amen. But it it's a great honor to have
[8:56] him here today. Amen. And his family and
[8:59] Amen. We uh we
[9:02] also know that this will be uh the last
[9:04] Sunday before many of you go to the uh
[9:07] to the youth camp. So uh we'll be
[9:10] praying uh and asking the Lord for his
[9:12] blessings upon that as well. Amen. In
[9:15] Revelation chapter 10, let's start in
[9:18] the seventh verse.
[9:20] But in the days of the voice of the
[9:22] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[9:25] sound the mystery of God, should be
[9:28] finished, as he's declared to his
[9:30] servants, the prophets. And the voice
[9:33] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[9:35] again, and said, "Go take the little
[9:38] book which is open in the hand of the
[9:41] angel, which standeth upon the sea, and
[9:43] upon the earth." Now, it's very
[9:44] important because that little book was
[9:46] closed in Revelations 5, was untouchable
[9:49] in Revelations 5, and here it is open in
[9:53] Revelations 10, and John is being
[9:56] invited to take it. But this is after
[9:58] verse 7, which is the seventh angel. So,
[10:01] there's been a transition. The word has
[10:03] been opened. And he says, "And I went
[10:06] unto the angel and said unto him, give
[10:08] me the little book. And he said unto me,
[10:11] take it and eat it up, and it shall make
[10:13] thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy
[10:16] mouth sweet as honey. And I took the
[10:19] little book out of the angel's hand and
[10:21] ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet
[10:23] as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it,
[10:25] my belly was bitter. And he said unto
[10:28] me, "Thou must prophesy again before
[10:31] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[10:34] kings." I'll read Matthew 4:4 to you.
[10:37] But he answered and said, "It is
[10:39] written, man shall not live by bread
[10:42] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[10:45] out of the mouth of God." May God bless
[10:48] you this morning as you be seated. Uh if
[10:50] I would take a title today, a subtitle.
[10:52] Of course, I'm still on this, the
[10:54] opening of the word. I want to just take
[10:56] a subtitle today. On the bride's feast.
[10:59] On the bride's feast. Amen. Knowing this
[11:02] that she's feeding on the hidden things
[11:04] of God. And we could call it the secret
[11:06] things of God. Amen. But that when it is
[11:10] revealed, it becomes our possession.
[11:12] Amen. So, Amen. It becomes our it
[11:15] becomes our food. Amen. This is this is
[11:17] bride food. When you when you're
[11:19] studying the the ministry of brother
[11:21] Brandham, when you're hearing the
[11:23] opening of the word and the preaching of
[11:24] those seals, Amen. That's not food for
[11:27] everyone, but it is food for the bride
[11:30] of Christ. It it is your food. This is
[11:32] your banquet. It is your feast. It is
[11:34] the time and I I could call it as
[11:37] brother Bramman preached the message
[11:38] feast of trumpets and he said well to
[11:40] the to the bride it's not feast of
[11:42] trumpets he said it's hidden mysteries.
[11:45] Amen. So the same thing that it was to
[11:47] the Jews and trumpets it'll be the
[11:50] opening of the seals to the bride. It
[11:52] has the same effects of the seventh
[11:53] trumpet to the Jew is a seventh seal to
[11:56] the bride. Amen. And we recognize then
[11:58] that would create a feast. And that's
[12:00] the great mystery of the church. Brother
[12:02] Bram telling us that we needed to be
[12:04] able to put together the two sides.
[12:06] Remember he said there's the fundamental
[12:08] on one side. He said, "And they they
[12:10] know who they are." He said, "But they
[12:12] just ain't got any power to make it
[12:14] work." And he said, "But on the other
[12:15] side," he said, "they got all the
[12:17] power." He said, "But they don't know
[12:18] who they are." So he said, "What we
[12:20] needed was the two of them to get
[12:21] together." Amen. And we could find out
[12:23] somebody who they are. And and and I'm
[12:25] paraphrasing, "But then they they have
[12:27] something to make it manifest." And I
[12:30] certainly believe that's a a simple way
[12:31] of saying we need mechanics and
[12:33] dynamics. And amen. It's not a frolic
[12:36] and it's not a funeral, but it is a
[12:38] feast. A feast with Christ. Amen. And
[12:41] it's amazing the time that we're living
[12:43] that we have been invited to partake not
[12:46] of of just anything, but to be able to
[12:48] feed on the mind of God. Knowing that
[12:52] what a prophet is is a prophet is one
[12:54] that channels to us, amen, the things
[12:56] that have been unseen or the things that
[12:59] have been unspoken. According to
[13:00] scripture, it would take a prophet to
[13:02] reveal a secret or to make something
[13:04] known that was unknown. So you when
[13:07] you're feeding now, God promised in this
[13:09] generation that he would send Malachi 4,
[13:12] that he would stop the curse that was
[13:14] going to come upon the age. In
[13:16] Revelations 10, it lets us know that
[13:18] that Elijah would be the seventh angel,
[13:21] amen, of the Leodysian church. And of
[13:23] course, we know, amen, that angel was a
[13:26] man named William Brandom. It was a
[13:28] prophet that God sent in the age. Amen.
[13:30] Telling us, of course, that Amos the eth
[13:33] chapter, amen, was not a histo.
[13:37] It's not something in the future, but
[13:39] revealing that the famine that was
[13:42] prophesied in the book of Amos is a
[13:44] famine that is it is meant for this day.
[13:47] That it would not be Amen. for bread and
[13:49] water, but it would be for the hearing
[13:51] of the true word of God. Amen. telling
[13:53] us that this is the season the the great
[13:56] pale horse of the apocalypse of
[13:58] revelation would ride out in the age and
[14:00] it would be a conglomeration of things
[14:02] which would bring a dismal and a dark
[14:05] time. It would bring confusion amen to
[14:07] everyone. It would be such a deceiving
[14:09] confusing time and people would be
[14:12] deceived. Even the elect if it were
[14:14] possible they wouldn't know what to
[14:15] believe. They would be confused upon it.
[14:18] But but God would send in that same
[14:20] season an eagle who is a prophet which
[14:23] is also the seventh angel which is also
[14:25] Elijah. Amen. Which is in that season he
[14:29] would come with thus saith the Lord
[14:31] which would end the confusion. It would
[14:33] it would end the struggles and it would
[14:35] give us an absolute that we wouldn't
[14:37] have to be ashamed and we wouldn't have
[14:39] to worry about it. And I believe that
[14:41] it's a great fulfillment of the prophecy
[14:43] of David in Psalms 37 when he said that
[14:47] in the time of famine, we shall be
[14:49] satisfied. Amen. I'll tell you, I I I
[14:52] think that would go on our
[14:53] refrigerators. Well, in the time of
[14:55] famine, we shall be satisfied. I believe
[14:59] that a prophet was knowing that God had
[15:02] ordained his life. In Revelation chapter
[15:04] 4, referring to the great uh vision of
[15:07] the mountain of bread that was in the
[15:09] west, he says of this and he said, "I
[15:12] saw that great mountain of bread and I
[15:14] saw white robes coming from all over the
[15:16] earth to eat this bread, oh God." He
[15:18] said, "Let me never fail to feed the
[15:20] people on the bread of life." Amen. And
[15:23] that's my same prayer this morning that
[15:25] we never fail to feed, Amen. the
[15:28] children of this age, the bread of this
[15:31] age, the message of the hour. I love it
[15:34] in the unveiling. Brother Bannon will
[15:36] say this. He said that old badger skin
[15:38] denominations is tore down. He said, "We
[15:40] have broke through that into the shakana
[15:42] of glory and I see the word. I see the
[15:44] pillar of fire moving. I see the word
[15:47] manifest." He said, "What he said he
[15:49] would do in the last days, I see it
[15:51] growing. I see the children eating the
[15:54] shakana bread coming from the ripening
[15:57] of that word which believes it. Isn't
[15:59] that amazing? A prophet is is watching
[16:02] people taking his message and he says
[16:05] they're eating the shakana bread that is
[16:08] coming from the ripening of the word
[16:10] those which believe it in the spiritual
[16:12] food and season. He said, "Oh, what a
[16:14] joy it is to see children eating the
[16:17] bread that's been sent to them." You
[16:19] realize visions years ago right here in
[16:21] this tabernacle of the bread of life.
[16:23] There it is in spiritual food saying
[16:25] she's now eating that bread. Amen. He
[16:28] says, "Oh, the children eating the bread
[16:30] of God. May this child also enjoy faith,
[16:33] the bread of God that gives them now for
[16:36] their healing." I certainly believe that
[16:39] this message is the bread of God. I I
[16:41] believe this is the word that has
[16:43] proceeded out of the mouth of God. I
[16:46] believe it's the it's called in the
[16:48] Bible in Matthew 24 it's called meat in
[16:51] due season.
[16:53] Amen. It's sometime people say, "Well,
[16:55] why why y'all preach about the message
[16:57] all the time?" Because it's the meat in
[16:59] due season. It's the provision of the
[17:01] age we're living in. This is not a
[17:03] history lesson. Amen. This is a
[17:05] manifested word of the age that we're
[17:08] living in. And the and Jesus in his own
[17:11] words said, "My faithful and wise
[17:13] servant is him who the Lord would make
[17:16] ruler of his household to give them meat
[17:19] in due season. Blessed is a servant when
[17:21] him the Lord shall come and find him
[17:24] doing so." Let me just give you Jesus's
[17:26] words. Blessed is the man that'll preach
[17:29] this message to the congregations. Amen.
[17:31] that'll that'll be able to preach the
[17:33] message of his hour, knowing that the
[17:35] season has changed and knowing there
[17:38] must be a message for this season.
[17:40] According to 1 Thessalonians 4, there
[17:43] has been a change and and the change is
[17:45] a change for rapture. Amen. I don't
[17:48] believe we're just another church age or
[17:50] just another bride, but this is the
[17:52] season of rapture. And if it is a season
[17:54] for rapture, there must be a food for
[17:57] rapture. There's got to come a food
[17:58] that's not just for the crossing of the
[18:01] wilderness, but it's for the taking of
[18:03] the land. A food that will change your
[18:05] body in the moment, in the twinkling of
[18:08] an eye. Where you going to get a food
[18:09] like that? Where where in the
[18:11] denominations are you going to find a
[18:13] food that has lifegiving substance that
[18:16] has changing power that can that can
[18:19] resurrect you from dead formal
[18:21] traditions and and bring a fire of God
[18:23] in the lives of the children living mana
[18:26] that manifested itself daily. Oh, I say
[18:29] it would take a message from God. It
[18:31] would take a message from Melkazedc
[18:33] himself. It would take a a meeting with
[18:35] with you and I just like Abraham had on
[18:39] his journey home when Melazdc was the
[18:42] one that brought the bread and wine. And
[18:44] I believe the message of the hour is
[18:46] fulfilling God's way of bringing the
[18:49] church a provision on their way home of
[18:52] bread and wine. Bread of substance that
[18:55] will change not just a bread, amen, of
[18:57] denominations, but a bread of sincerity
[19:01] and a bread of truth. a keeping of the
[19:03] feast of sincerity and truth with God.
[19:06] We're not just eating. We're eating the
[19:09] bread of life that will change a man.
[19:11] That will transform a man. It'll change
[19:14] the way you think. It'll change the way
[19:16] you talk. It'll change the way you look.
[19:18] It'll change the way you believe. A
[19:20] bread for the season that we're living
[19:23] in. I believe it. I I don't believe this
[19:26] is just another season, but this is
[19:28] bride season. Amen. This is bride time.
[19:32] Let me give you another word. This is
[19:34] bride age. This is the manifestation of
[19:37] the word. It's the bride's message.
[19:40] That's right. In first Thessalonians 4,
[19:43] it is the shout of the voice of the
[19:45] archangel. And we become that voice. You
[19:47] know how you become the voice? You
[19:49] become what you eat.
[19:52] You speak what you eat. You what you
[19:54] studying and what you believe in. That's
[19:57] what you're going to talk. That's what
[19:58] you're going to say. And I believe,
[20:00] amen, that there has been a message from
[20:02] God, a shout, a living bread that brings
[20:05] forth the bride. The message brings
[20:08] forth the bride. You You see the
[20:10] necessity of eating that message? It
[20:13] brings forth the bride. Amen. It's the
[20:16] creation of a bride. The prophet said
[20:18] it. This is not just another designation
[20:21] of himself. This is the creation of the
[20:25] bride of heaven. And it took this word
[20:28] to create this bride. That's right.
[20:30] Amen. Of course, it is the changing of
[20:32] seasons. In Joshua the 5th chapter,
[20:35] you'll find when they crossed from the
[20:37] from the wilderness into the promised
[20:39] land. There it was. Amen. When they
[20:41] crossed in that they encamped at Gilgal
[20:44] and the Bible said, "And they kept the
[20:46] Passover on the 14th day of the month,
[20:49] even in the plains of Jericho." Amen.
[20:51] Now, you know the Passover was a harvest
[20:53] festival, right? Amen. And it was when
[20:55] they ate of the unleavened cakes and the
[20:58] parched corn on the land of the promise.
[21:02] Amen. It was then that the mana ceased
[21:04] on the tomorrow after they had eaten the
[21:06] corn of the land. So, so there was a
[21:08] season change. They had left the
[21:10] wilderness and they had moved into the
[21:12] promise. the mana, the physical things,
[21:15] they amen, the the what what what what
[21:17] would you could look at and talk about
[21:19] all those things begin to disappear, but
[21:21] they begin to get fruit and they begin
[21:23] to get corn out of the land, the very
[21:26] land that they had been promised for
[21:28] hundreds of years. They were now
[21:30] standing in. They weren't just there.
[21:32] They were now eating in that land. And
[21:34] so is it this bride, this church of the
[21:37] living God has crossed over from just a
[21:40] leisian message of Pentecostal ideas and
[21:44] they were transported into the promises
[21:46] of God where they could open the book
[21:48] and begin to feed and begin to eat upon
[21:51] the things of God. I'm so glad this
[21:52] morning to know that we can read the
[21:55] stories of had he right and we can feed
[21:57] on a message that would make us believe
[21:59] things that are impossible that would
[22:02] open the doors and and would transition
[22:04] us from being a defensive people who's
[22:07] just trying to keep what we got who's
[22:10] just trying to hold on to a little lie.
[22:12] but it would make us an offensive bride
[22:15] and would take the sword of the Lord and
[22:17] begin to possess the lands of promise
[22:19] that God had made us in this age. I'm so
[22:22] glad this morning we can pick up this
[22:24] word and we've got a strength that we
[22:26] can face every enemy. We can face every
[22:29] giant. We can walk down every wall. We
[22:32] can cross every river. I say we can take
[22:34] the land. I say if you eat this book,
[22:37] you'll say it with me. We can take the
[22:39] book. Hallelujah. But we ain't got to
[22:42] setting wish this morning and just hope
[22:44] maybe so. We can take this land. We have
[22:47] a right to this land. It is our land. It
[22:51] is our corn. It is our hopes.
[22:54] Hallelujah. Is our revival.
[22:58] That's right. My goodness. Feeding on
[23:01] these messages. Amen. To bring revival
[23:05] that you can shout before it happens.
[23:09] Glory. give you strength to you can
[23:12] rejoice before it takes place.
[23:14] Hallelujah. You can begin to worship
[23:17] like Mary did it. Be it unto me
[23:19] according to thy word and begin to tell
[23:21] people I'm going to bring forth a
[23:23] Messiah. And so can you begin to tell
[23:26] people what God's going to do in you. I
[23:29] believe it this morning. I believe amen
[23:31] that God has given strong meat to the
[23:33] church. strong meat of predestination
[23:36] and strong meat of adoption and strong
[23:40] meat of authority and bride's positions
[23:42] and and the idea and concept that we're
[23:45] not lost one day and saved one day, but
[23:48] rather we were a part of the mind of God
[23:50] from the foundations of the world. I
[23:52] certainly believe this morning that this
[23:55] message produces more than a bunch of
[23:57] weak hot plant uh hot house plant
[24:00] chickens and and little little ideas and
[24:03] and soft soap things. But I believe a
[24:05] mature wheat brings before a mature
[24:08] church. In Hebrews 5, it's Paul said,
[24:11] "For I have time." He says, "You ought
[24:13] to be teachers, but have one need to
[24:15] teach you again the first principles of
[24:18] the oracles of God and become have
[24:20] needing of milk and not of strong meat.
[24:22] For everyone that useth milk is
[24:24] unskillful in the word of righteousness,
[24:26] for he is a babe." Now, now watch what
[24:29] he said. But strong meat belongth to
[24:32] them that are of a full age. Amen. And
[24:35] even those who have reason of their
[24:37] senses exercised to discern both good
[24:40] and evil. Do you recognize Paul is
[24:42] saying there is coming, Amen, a mature
[24:45] age? There is coming a mature There is
[24:47] coming, you can't have a marriage
[24:49] without a mature girl.
[24:51] Come on, church. You can't have a
[24:53] marriage without a mature woman. This
[24:55] bride has matured to the place of
[24:58] marriage. And what has brought maturity?
[25:01] It is the meat of the age that we're
[25:03] living in. In Matthew chapter 24, watch
[25:06] the 27th verse. Jesus said, "As the
[25:08] lightning cometh out of the east, and
[25:10] shineth unto the west, so also shall the
[25:13] coming of the son of man be. For
[25:16] wheresoever the carcass is, there the
[25:19] eagles will be gathered together. Where
[25:21] the carcass is." Now, they asked Brother
[25:24] Bham this question, "Brother Bham, what
[25:25] does this mean? Where's the carcass?
[25:27] There's the eagles." He says, "The
[25:29] carcass is what they're feeding on." He
[25:32] said, "That's the fresh mana. That's
[25:33] what they're feeding on." He said, "And
[25:35] the Eagles, of course, is prophetic."
[25:38] Amen. And you know, you're a prophetic
[25:40] people.
[25:42] Not just church, but you're a prophetic
[25:45] people. I I show it to you in the
[25:47] scripture. The spirit of Jesus Christ is
[25:49] the spirit of prophecy. And the
[25:50] testimony of Jesus is the token of the
[25:52] age. The life that's in you is a
[25:54] prophetic life. Amen. You're not just
[25:58] another class of people. You're a
[25:59] prophetic class of people. Amen. Now,
[26:02] watch what he says. And brother Ben
[26:04] says, "But see the eagle's believers."
[26:06] See, what is the carcass they feed on?
[26:09] It's the word. Wherever the word is, the
[26:12] true nature of a bird will show itself.
[26:15] An eagle wants fresh meat. He must have
[26:17] fresh meat. Not a buzzard. He's an
[26:19] eagle. Now, now, Brother Brandham gives
[26:22] us an old he gives us a farm lesson
[26:23] right here. This gives you a good old
[26:25] natural lesson. If you watch the stage
[26:28] of the carcass, you can tell the kind of
[26:30] bird that's eaten because an eagle don't
[26:33] eat on the mana from yesterday. Eagles
[26:37] are not looking for old dead uh uh
[26:39] things that are rotten and stinking that
[26:42] was left over from another age. They
[26:44] don't have to because there's a fresh
[26:47] kill for the age they're living in. So
[26:49] there the the nature of an eagle is to
[26:52] get the fresh kill. It's to get
[26:54] something with struggle in it. I I don't
[26:56] know about you and I, but I like about
[26:58] you, but I like a little life. I I like
[27:00] to I like I like to feel what I what I'm
[27:03] dealing with in the spiritual senses. I
[27:05] like to get a revelation that makes me
[27:07] struggle a little bit. I mean, I like
[27:10] something that don't leave me right
[27:12] where I'm at. You know, I'm talking
[27:13] about stuff, Amen, that you can sit on
[27:15] the ground and eat. There there's
[27:16] sermons you can set on the ground and
[27:18] eat, but there's other sermons you're
[27:20] going to have to get up in the air and
[27:22] you're going to have to get in the
[27:23] spirit of the age and you're going to
[27:25] have to be able to fly quick like an
[27:27] eagle to catch the revelation of the
[27:30] age. This is not a bunch of hawk
[27:32] gathering this morning. This is not a
[27:34] chicken gathering this morning. This is
[27:35] an eagle gathering where the revelation
[27:38] of the word of God can be caught by an
[27:40] eagle. And when they catch it, the
[27:42] struggle comes in their life and and
[27:44] they struggle with the idea that I was a
[27:47] son before the world began. Oh, but they
[27:49] begin to feed on it. And the strength of
[27:51] those ideas,
[27:56] I say, struggle with it till you believe
[27:58] it. Struggle with it until you feel the
[28:00] blessing of it. Struggle with the
[28:02] message. Let the revelations come. Don't
[28:05] just set Don't just let something leave
[28:07] you where you are. You sit in your seat
[28:09] and say, "Yes, we believe. Yes. Yes.
[28:12] Amen. Let something come that brings a
[28:15] struggle to your existence.
[28:18] Makes you move in the power of God to
[28:21] catch the revelation of it. I know it's
[28:23] moving fast, but eagles can catch it.
[28:26] Eagles can catch it. Listen, if you're
[28:29] trying to even in this message, you
[28:31] better be in the message daily or you'll
[28:33] get left behind. The revelations in this
[28:36] message are breaking so fast. Amen. It
[28:39] breaks so fast. Amen. that you if you
[28:41] get to lolly gagging back there, you'll
[28:43] miss you'll miss areas. And I I could
[28:46] preach here a minute, but I I'll just
[28:48] say this. I I met a group one time in
[28:50] Norway that got caught up with a with a
[28:52] preacher, and I I hate I might as well
[28:54] just say his name. He's popular all over
[28:56] the world for doing it, but Junior
[28:57] Jackson took a different idea than
[28:59] Brother Brandham. Remember that he split
[29:01] Brother Brandham's uh church over gifts
[29:04] back in the 60s when brother Brandham
[29:05] said in order. He split the church, took
[29:07] part of them with him. Well, he that
[29:09] wasn't where he stopped, though.
[29:11] Remember, Brother Bram said, "Don't
[29:12] y'all feel bad at him now? He believes
[29:13] the message same as I did." And and and
[29:15] and those but the people that followed
[29:17] him, they all of a sudden, Brother
[29:20] Jackson had better ideas than Brother
[29:22] Brandham. And they started transpiring
[29:24] in those and he began to teach and I run
[29:27] into his teachings in different places
[29:28] all over the country. He's a good man,
[29:30] but he just had a different idea than
[29:32] Brother Brandham did. And then they
[29:34] build on it. And there was a group in
[29:35] Norway got caught up in that. And years
[29:38] later I went over there, me and brother
[29:39] Ron Peterson, actually we was preaching
[29:41] some conventions over there. And the
[29:43] brother in there, he came up to me
[29:44] afterward. He said, "I'm upset, brother
[29:46] Wayne." He said, "We have missed 20
[29:48] years of the revelations that has
[29:50] progressed in this message because we
[29:53] got stopped and way laid on the
[29:55] sidelines with somebody saying they had
[29:56] a better idea." Amen. And there has been
[29:59] people in the message, they get caught
[30:00] in little church fights or they get
[30:02] caught in little arguments and
[30:03] doctrines. Amen. And they're studying to
[30:05] argue one with another. But Amen. We're
[30:08] not studying to argue. We're studying to
[30:10] eat that we can feed on the word of God
[30:14] that we can keep growing and growing and
[30:16] growing. We don't we don't want to get
[30:18] 10 years down the road and realize we've
[30:21] missed the great revelations of God. But
[30:23] I believe we are to live on the edge of
[30:26] the revelations that God is revealing in
[30:28] the age. And one of these mornings, it's
[30:31] going to become a reality. The rapture
[30:33] is a revelation.
[30:35] And we're stepping revelation by
[30:37] revelation into the word of God. And
[30:39] it's changing us.
[30:42] Hallelujah. It's already started on you.
[30:46] That's right. It's already started
[30:48] changing. It's already began to change.
[30:51] And you can tell the kind of bird by the
[30:53] carcass it feeds on. That's right.
[30:55] That's right. You see an old carcass
[30:57] that's a that that that's a
[31:00] it's another age behind you and you see
[31:03] people feeding on that. It ain't an
[31:05] eagle. That's right.
[31:07] Come on. Cuz eagles are get up off of
[31:10] that thing.
[31:12] And fly on to where there's living mana.
[31:16] Hallelujah. I'm not a buzzard. You're an
[31:19] eagle. You can't give no denominational
[31:21] stuff to him. He's got eagle's food. The
[31:23] freshest meat, not what Moses done or
[31:25] Knox or Finny or somebody else. The meat
[31:28] that's killed for this day. The part of
[31:29] Christ that died to make his word
[31:32] confirmed. That's what they're going to
[31:33] eat on. The fresh kill. They like they
[31:36] like the fresh kill of the word of God.
[31:39] Amen. The revelations of it that come
[31:41] and bring. Now that carcass is, Amen.
[31:44] That's where the eagles are gathered
[31:46] together. Brother Bam says it in seed,
[31:47] not air, but the shock. He promised us a
[31:50] full square meal, the full seven course
[31:53] menu of all of the seven seals to be
[31:56] opened and everything is ready for the
[31:58] word of God. Some people still waiting
[32:00] for the last course. You know, they just
[32:02] got six courses of it and they can't
[32:04] really believe that seventh one's
[32:06] coming. But let me tell you this. Amen.
[32:08] That prophet set the table before he
[32:10] left. Amen. That prophet set this
[32:12] bride's table before he left because God
[32:15] wouldn't allow somebody else to preach
[32:17] this seventh seal and the prophet ain't
[32:20] coming back to preach it. So he preached
[32:22] it before he left. Left it on the table
[32:25] and said, "Come on and feed bride. The
[32:28] full course has been served." Listen, if
[32:31] you ain't eating the seventh course,
[32:33] it's just cuz you don't know it's on the
[32:35] table.
[32:36] Oh, but it's all on the table this
[32:38] morning. If it's the word of God, this
[32:40] is the climax age. This is the age that
[32:43] when you recognize this message, this
[32:46] word is eagle's food. That's when you've
[32:50] heard from your theophony. Well, these
[32:52] people don't even believe we have
[32:53] theophony. But but the prophet said,
[32:55] when you've recognized this message is
[32:58] eagle food, you heard from your
[33:00] theophony.
[33:02] [Applause]
[33:03] Well, glory to God. I ain't hearing from
[33:05] somebody else's. I heard from my own.
[33:08] Cuz I'm identified in this message.
[33:11] Hallelujah. If I was the only one, I
[33:14] believe he would still do it. That's
[33:17] right. I believe he has set the whole
[33:19] meal up.
[33:22] Just for me. Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:26] Do you see many of you that follow the
[33:28] message, we've been accused, and you
[33:30] know, uh, unrightfully so, we have been
[33:33] accused of following a man. Now I will
[33:36] say for the sake of the critic they are
[33:38] right in some sense there are groups
[33:40] that do follow brother Brandham and they
[33:43] worship brother Brandham and they look
[33:45] for his return just like I do for
[33:47] Jesus's return and they they they every
[33:50] bit of the deity of Christ they have
[33:51] placed in him for worship and ideas. I I
[33:54] I get that. But but that ain't got
[33:56] nothing to do with Christianity. That's
[33:58] right.
[34:00] Come on church. That's what somebody did
[34:03] with the right thing. Right. It has
[34:05] nothing to do with the right thing.
[34:08] Just cuz somebody cooks a well done
[34:10] steak don't mean all steaks are well
[34:12] done.
[34:13] [Applause]
[34:18] You can run it for yourself, but it's
[34:20] still a good steak.
[34:23] Amen.
[34:27] See, you're not feeding on the man.
[34:31] You You listen to Brother Bram's words.
[34:33] It wasn't me, the seventh angel. It was
[34:36] a manifestation of the son of man.
[34:39] That's right. See, the son of man is
[34:41] Christ. He is the one you're feeding on.
[34:45] You're not feeding on a man. His his
[34:47] words will fail. You're feeding on the
[34:49] unfailing body word of the son of man.
[34:54] Amen. Do you see? This is the spiritual
[34:57] food of the seven seals was promised to
[35:00] be open. Do you see? It's the food of
[35:03] the age. I love how Brother Bram says
[35:05] this one. This has become a new book.
[35:07] Since the opening of these seals, this
[35:09] has become a new book. And the things
[35:11] that's been hid has been revealed as God
[35:13] promised in Revelations 10 that he would
[35:15] do it. And we are privileged people that
[35:18] God has chosen this earth that we might
[35:20] understand these things which is not
[35:22] some mythical fleshly mind of a person
[35:25] trying to make it up. It's the word of
[35:28] God manifested, proven that it's right.
[35:32] I love how he says it in rising the sun.
[35:34] The quickening power has come to open
[35:36] seven seals. What was that? The
[35:39] intelligence of a man. No, the
[35:42] quickening power of God. What are you
[35:45] feeding on? Quickening power. Quickening
[35:48] power that raised you from denomination
[35:50] and made you bride. Things that could
[35:52] quicken you, Amen, from your former
[35:55] life. transform you to be the very queen
[35:58] of heaven. You think about a food that
[36:00] you could eat that could move you from
[36:02] being church to being bride. Hallelujah.
[36:05] I say, "Give me of this food. Take give
[36:08] me of this food and let me eat." Amen.
[36:11] That my that I'm that I might be
[36:12] changed. That I might be transformed.
[36:15] that I might be moved from one place to
[36:18] another to be taken out of the power of
[36:20] darkness and be put into the
[36:22] transferring, amen, of the very kingdom
[36:25] of God. Now, real children of God are
[36:28] hungering and thirsting. You know why?
[36:30] Because there's something in you telling
[36:32] you you need something.
[36:35] And brother Brandham says it very
[36:36] clearly. He tells you why you hunger and
[36:38] thirst for this message. And he t it and
[36:41] actually explains it by a little boy.
[36:43] You It's pretty good. But he talks that
[36:45] about that little boy. He says he went
[36:46] and and eat on the bicycle pedals. How
[36:48] many ever heard, brother tell that
[36:50] story? Went and eat on the bicycle
[36:51] pedals. He said, "And they took it to
[36:53] the doctor to find out why." He said the
[36:55] reason was the sulfur was in that
[36:58] bicycle pedal. Amen. And and the boy had
[37:02] not had enough sulfur in his birth. So
[37:05] he went to the bicycle pedal to get what
[37:07] he lacked. Amen. That that bicycle pedal
[37:10] that sulfur that was in there came out
[37:12] of the same ground. But it was in a
[37:14] different form. So he bypassed it and
[37:16] then in another form was getting it
[37:19] just like you and I bypassed our
[37:22] theophony and was born into this age.
[37:26] But we come from the lamb's book of
[37:29] life. And now we circle back to feed on
[37:33] this message because it's our inner
[37:35] being knowing that we can go back to
[37:38] where we come from through this message.
[37:41] That's right. See, God is redeeming you.
[37:44] Thank you, Jesus. Isn't he redeeming
[37:46] you? Then you started out as something
[37:48] and bypassed it. Now you're going back
[37:50] to something. You're not going back to
[37:53] angels. You never were angels. You're
[37:55] not going back to servants. You never
[37:57] were servants. But you're going back to
[38:00] bride because you always was bride.
[38:05] That's why you couldn't stay in that
[38:06] denomination. That's why you couldn't
[38:08] stay in that bad. That's why you
[38:10] couldn't stay on the bar stool. That's
[38:12] why you couldn't stay in that false
[38:15] doctrine around this message. But
[38:16] something brought you out of it because
[38:19] you know I was never put here to be just
[38:22] another member. I am a part of the bride
[38:26] that came out of the mind of God and I'm
[38:29] going back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:33] Amen. Clear me some room this morning.
[38:35] I'm going back. Give me room to go back.
[38:38] Go back where I started. Go back in the
[38:41] presence of God. Going back into the
[38:43] very teachings of his word.
[38:48] You got to go back.
[38:51] Anything constricting you from this
[38:52] message is taking you from your destiny.
[38:59] I feel a call of God to go back.
[39:02] It's the call of the eagle. It's the
[39:04] expectation of a mother. You know,
[39:06] brother Bam talks about it things that
[39:08] are to be and said you a woman wakes up
[39:10] and she's middle of the night she's got
[39:12] a it's not the usual hunger that makes
[39:17] you know something's wrong. Yeah. It's
[39:20] the unusual hunger.
[39:23] Amen. It's when she says not when she
[39:26] wants pickles. She might eat pickles all
[39:27] the time. And it's not when she says she
[39:29] eats ice cream because she may like ice
[39:31] cream. But when she says she wants
[39:33] pickles and mustard and ice cream all at
[39:35] the same time,
[39:38] something's up.
[39:41] Amen. And the prophet of God said,
[39:42] "What's what's going on? There's another
[39:44] life in there and that life is
[39:47] hungering."
[39:49] But it can only get fed through that
[39:51] mother. He said, "So since a father
[39:54] wants a perfect child, he goes to the
[39:56] store and gets the provision needed to
[39:59] have a perfect child. and you sitting
[40:01] here this morning. Amen. Come into the
[40:03] church. Maybe there's a hunger in you,
[40:05] but it's not just for the usual line,
[40:08] y'all. Y'all, I don't want to get like
[40:10] we're in unusual, but brother Brandham
[40:12] says it when God does great miracles, he
[40:14] said if that man stays in the same line,
[40:16] he said it didn't come from God. He said
[40:19] cuz God only sends those things when
[40:21] he's going to do the unusual and he's
[40:23] going to change things. Amen. And he was
[40:26] showing you his message was bringing
[40:28] about a change in the diet, the food
[40:31] that we were eating. Amen. Because there
[40:34] was a body change coming on.
[40:38] There had to be a message to bring the
[40:40] the meaning of that. Y'all y'all know
[40:43] brother Brandham said God would call a
[40:44] man to preach a sermon because of the
[40:46] need of the congregation.
[40:49] You know that he said your your need
[40:52] would cause a man to come to the
[40:54] platform and say things a certain way. I
[40:56] know some of you don't amen real loud
[40:58] and I'd be all right. That's okay with
[41:00] me honestly because you know what? That
[41:02] baby, that thing forming in you is
[41:04] getting nutrients whether you're saying
[41:06] anything or not.
[41:08] And sometimes when you're really eating,
[41:10] you got a mouthful and you can't say a
[41:12] lot, but you're getting a lot. And I
[41:14] just pray this morning that you eat what
[41:16] I'm talking about. That is food to your
[41:18] soul and it's developing something on
[41:21] the inside. I'm stronger today than I
[41:24] was yesterday. And I'm going to eat
[41:26] today and I'll be stronger in the
[41:27] morning than I was the day before. This
[41:30] is not a Pentecostal revival. This is a
[41:33] growing stronger until we leave this
[41:36] earth in the presence of God. Ain't how
[41:39] I feel. Ain't what I think. It's what
[41:42] the word of God has laid out for the
[41:44] generation. The word, the word said
[41:47] we're going to go higher.
[41:50] Hallelujah. Be it unto me according to
[41:52] thy word.
[41:54] Blessed are the meek, for they shall
[41:56] inherit the earth. And blessed are they
[41:57] which do hunger and thirst after
[42:00] righteousness.
[42:02] They shall
[42:05] glory. Glory. They shall be filled.
[42:09] Amen.
[42:10] You know what the word righteousness
[42:12] actually breaks down in the Greek to
[42:14] mean? It means the doctrine concerning
[42:17] the way in which a man to attend a state
[42:19] approved of God. It means integrity,
[42:22] virtue, purity of life, rightness,
[42:25] correctness of thinking, feeling and
[42:28] acting.
[42:30] If you have a hunger to think, to feel,
[42:34] and to act right, God's got a food for
[42:37] you. Amen. If you want to think bride,
[42:40] you want to walk like a bride, you want
[42:42] to talk like a bride, there's a message
[42:44] for you. Come on. Amen. If that's not
[42:47] your goal, any old church will do. Any
[42:51] old doctrine will do. But if you want to
[42:53] walk bride, talk bride, think bride, be
[42:56] bride, you will have to have a bride's
[42:58] message.
[43:00] Yes, sir. That's right. Come on, church.
[43:03] Amen. Now, I'll take you real fast to
[43:05] Genesis 18. And remember when Genesis 18
[43:08] that Abraham was met by Elohim that came
[43:11] to his tent. Remember what he did? He
[43:13] read the heart and he says, "Thou shalt
[43:15] be with a child." And then he said, "Why
[43:18] did Sarah laugh?" And Abraham said,
[43:20] "Sarah laughed." And he said, "Yeah." He
[43:23] said, "Where's Sarah?" He said, "Well,
[43:24] she's in the tent behind you." And the
[43:26] Bible lets us know that she didn't laugh
[43:29] out loud.
[43:31] Brother Bram said she laughed up her
[43:33] sleeve. Yeah. He says, "But that angel
[43:36] could tell you what was in her heart."
[43:40] That same angel. Now, in Genesis 18, in
[43:43] the first few verses, if you continue
[43:45] down just a little bit more, the Bible
[43:48] says in the 17th verse, he says that
[43:50] same angel said to Abraham, "Shall I
[43:52] hide from Abraham the thing which I do?
[43:56] Seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[43:57] a great and mighty nation, and the
[43:59] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[44:00] him. For I know him that he will command
[44:04] his children and his household after
[44:06] him, that they will keep the way of the
[44:08] Lord to do justice and judgment, that
[44:11] the Lord may bring upon Abraham that
[44:13] which was spoken of him. Brother Brandon
[44:16] puts it up in Hebrews chapter 1. He
[44:18] said, "Can I keep it from Abraham,
[44:20] seeing he's the heir of the earth,
[44:22] seeing that he's heir, can I keep it
[44:24] from him?" That's where the church ought
[44:26] to be today. That's right. Get the
[44:28] secrets of God. Know how to hold
[44:32] yourself, how to act, what to do, how to
[44:35] walk, how to live. We're the heirs of
[44:38] the earth. Amen. Listen, this is
[44:41] preparation time. This is when the
[44:44] character of the church gets to a place
[44:47] to rule in the millennium that is
[44:49] coming. Amen. Look what it is. If you're
[44:51] going to be a ruling class, you're going
[44:54] to have to have a ruling tutor.
[44:57] You're going to have to have somebody
[44:58] that knows the laws of the kingdom of
[45:00] how to approach and how to walk and how
[45:02] to talk, what to say, what to do. Now,
[45:05] watch what Brother Bam's telling us. He
[45:07] made his secrets known to them. Revealed
[45:09] it to them, showing them what to do and
[45:12] how to live. How to forsake the things
[45:14] of the world. How to live godly in
[45:16] living godly in a present world and
[45:18] walking with him. The same one that was
[45:22] at the tent of Abraham teaching them
[45:24] what was coming and how to conduct
[45:27] themselves in that time is the same one
[45:30] that's coming to this age. Amen. And
[45:33] show the same sign that you and I would
[45:35] know his message was for the same
[45:38] purpose to teach us how to talk, how to
[45:41] walk.
[45:45] Now, now I could get real deep in it.
[45:47] I'm not going to. And I to you that like
[45:49] to study, I'll give you direction on
[45:50] this. But Moses told them how to put up
[45:52] their tents, how to cook their bread,
[45:54] how to build their fires, how to move,
[45:56] how to pack. He told them all what
[45:58] they're going to do and how they were
[45:59] going to do it. If you ever read about
[46:01] all those things, Moses done every bit
[46:03] of that for them people. And so has this
[46:06] message instructed this bride how to
[46:09] walk before God,
[46:13] brother. Amen. It's a transformation.
[46:16] It's a transferring. It's a It's a Can I
[46:19] say the message of the hour, it's the
[46:22] setting of a pattern over a people. When
[46:25] you read in Matthew 25 and you read of
[46:28] the 10 virgins, and you find, Brother
[46:30] Bram said, of course, the Bible's
[46:32] telling us five are wise and five are
[46:34] foolish. He says, "Now notice this.
[46:37] They're all virgins."
[46:40] Meaning they're all the same material.
[46:44] Yeah. How many in here sews? I know we
[46:47] got a we got a few of them. Even some of
[46:49] the kids sew and you get you a big bolt
[46:52] of material and it's all the same
[46:55] material.
[46:56] All the virgins are the same material.
[47:00] But brother said, but the difference in
[47:02] them is he lays a pattern over the
[47:05] material and that that falls within the
[47:08] pattern is known to us as wise virgins.
[47:11] Come on, church. Just as Moses was given
[47:15] the pattern on the mountain for the
[47:16] tabernacle in the wilderness, so did
[47:19] William Brandom have a tent vision, he
[47:23] has a tabernacle vision and built a
[47:26] pattern to lay over this bride. Amen.
[47:31] That those that fall within this message
[47:33] and the pattern of it fall within that
[47:36] wise virgin.
[47:38] Listen, you got to be for ordained to
[47:40] believe this or you won't.
[47:42] God has to fordain you to believe it
[47:44] because there's enough critics to talk
[47:46] you out of it. There's enough doubters
[47:48] right now. If you want to feed in the
[47:50] garbage can, go ahead and feed in the
[47:51] garbage can. I don't believe a thing
[47:53] they say.
[47:55] Whether you like Donald Trump or not is
[47:58] not the point. But don't go to CNN to
[48:00] get your opinion on him.
[48:03] It is so one-sided.
[48:06] Come on. They take everything and twist
[48:08] it a certain way. And so has critics and
[48:11] unbelievers done the same thing with
[48:13] this message. If you want to understand
[48:16] the message of William Brandham, go to
[48:18] the Bible and find out what the Bible
[48:21] says. What does God's word say about it?
[48:24] I ain't got time for critics and
[48:26] opinions and ideas of man. Come on
[48:29] church. It's the food of the bride. It
[48:32] is how we are going to come into our
[48:35] amen succession of truth. Amen. This
[48:38] happens by election and God. Amen. Now,
[48:42] now we're feeding. Bride's feast is a
[48:45] feeding on the mind of God. And I'll
[48:47] tell you this, without hesitation, God
[48:51] had you in his mind before the world
[48:54] began.
[48:56] Now, let me say it a little deeper than
[48:58] this. He had a picture of you.
[49:02] And brother Brandham said, "It wasn't
[49:04] taken of your bad times. It was in your
[49:07] perfection that he took it. And in the
[49:10] mind of God, there is a picture of
[49:12] perfection. Do you know? Amen. That's
[49:14] what Job the 38th chapter is about.
[49:16] Where were you when the sons of God were
[49:17] shouting for joy? Brother B said, "There
[49:19] they were sons shouting because they had
[49:22] been redeemed." That's what they were
[49:24] shouting about was redemption. Sons
[49:26] redeemed.
[49:28] Now you say, "Preacher, what are you
[49:30] really getting at?" I'll say this that
[49:31] God has a picture of you in your
[49:33] perfection that Satan can't touch.
[49:38] Have you ever had somebody talk bad
[49:39] about you and then you hear what they
[49:42] said about you and then you think, "I'm
[49:44] not the person they're talking about."
[49:48] Because they're painting a picture of
[49:49] you that doesn't resemble the real you.
[49:54] They take one action and make it a
[49:56] motive.
[49:58] I just love how people do that. I love
[50:00] this is this is a just this is free
[50:02] point but but I love how people do this.
[50:05] They judge your action and give you a
[50:07] motive when they want you to judge their
[50:10] actions and know their motive.
[50:13] So they they can do something but they
[50:15] say well I didn't mean nothing by it.
[50:18] But you do something and you definitely
[50:19] meant something by it. Right? Yeah.
[50:23] Yeah. But if you would judge one another
[50:25] the way you judge yourself, you'd
[50:27] understand not everybody does everything
[50:29] with a bad molding.
[50:31] They might not even been thinking when
[50:33] they walked by you and didn't shake your
[50:34] hand. They might have had something else
[50:36] on their mind and they're just walking
[50:37] out the building and you got it in your
[50:39] mind. Well, they got this happening and
[50:40] they Well, come on, pastor. Preach a
[50:43] little while. Amen. You see what it is?
[50:45] God, Amen. is showing you that the
[50:48] picture people get of you is not really
[50:50] you.
[50:52] I remember years ago I was intimidated.
[50:55] I was young. I was from the hills and
[50:57] didn't have a a a big education. I
[51:00] didn't know much about table manners or
[51:02] social and and it's just I mean I done
[51:04] good in the hills, but they took me out
[51:06] of the hills and set me set me at tables
[51:09] with with with with wealthy people and
[51:11] social people and good raised people and
[51:13] they knew all the rules and all. I
[51:15] didn't know all that. So I I to me in my
[51:18] in my little raisin mind I was the least
[51:21] person in the room, the least person at
[51:22] the table. I was the poorest, the most
[51:24] unlearned. So I usually sat quiet and I
[51:27] was just quiet. And one day, amen, I was
[51:29] talking to a group of people and this
[51:31] one girl, bless her heart, she finally
[51:33] helped me out. She said, "Brother
[51:34] Wayne," she said, "Think of it is," she
[51:36] said, "People kind of think you're stuck
[51:37] up."
[51:40] And I said, "Stuck up?" Said, "Yeah, you
[51:42] think you're better than somebody." And
[51:43] I was sitting there laughing because I
[51:45] was being quiet. They were assigning to
[51:48] the quietness that I thought I was
[51:50] bettering somebody when actually the
[51:52] quietness really was I didn't feel like
[51:54] I had no right to talk among people. And
[51:57] then immediately I realized that people
[52:00] do all the time assign motives and
[52:02] ideas. Amen. So what I figured out is
[52:04] I'm just going to be what God made me to
[52:06] be and forget it. Amen. Just live for
[52:09] God. Amen. Forget all of what who thinks
[52:12] and what. Forget all of that. Just live
[52:14] for the Lord. He has a picture of you. I
[52:18] don't have to explain to the whole world
[52:20] I'm a Christian or I'm a believer. But
[52:22] brother, there's something on the inside
[52:24] of me that takes me back to that picture
[52:27] that God had of me. And when I hear this
[52:30] message, I say, "Yes, that's the me.
[52:34] That's really me. That's who I am in my
[52:37] heart.
[52:39] That's who I really am. Say, "Who is
[52:41] Wayne Lawson?" Get to reading this
[52:43] message and you'll find my identity.
[52:46] You'll know how I think and how I feel
[52:48] and what I do. Somebody said, "What do
[52:49] you think about such and such and such?"
[52:50] I said, "Well, I'll tell you what. Look
[52:51] up what brother Brandham said, and
[52:53] that's exactly what I think."
[52:58] See, this was taken before the
[52:59] foundation of the world. That's what it
[53:02] was. It was taken before the world
[53:04] began. Now, had you come through a word
[53:08] birth,
[53:09] you wouldn't need to feed on the
[53:11] message,
[53:13] you would just have come as the message
[53:15] has already said. See, you could have
[53:17] bypassed this whole stage, but that
[53:18] wasn't how God did it.
[53:21] Now, I'm certain that if God did this,
[53:26] he puts it in he puts it in his Bible. I
[53:28] and and when you start studying
[53:30] scripture, it's powerful thing because
[53:31] because uh developing I got to study him
[53:33] one time on this on this dark room. How
[53:35] many photographers we got in here? I
[53:38] remember years ago, brother Vernon, he
[53:39] was in photography. Brother Joe's in
[53:40] photography back there. Everybody's
[53:43] photographers now, right?
[53:46] Used to be probably was a decent living
[53:48] in it. Now everybody got a digital
[53:50] camera can almost do what somebody Well,
[53:52] it ain't the same, but we think it is.
[53:54] you know,
[53:56] made professionals out of everybody, you
[53:58] know, but years ago they took pictures
[54:00] and had to take the negatives and
[54:02] develop them in the in the dark room and
[54:04] all that. So to be a photographer, you
[54:05] had to be pretty serious, but in that
[54:08] dark room was the development, but in
[54:10] the message, see, we're not being
[54:12] developed in a dark room. I know death
[54:15] shall develop some,
[54:18] but that tent, there was a light over
[54:20] that room. And it wasn't a dark room. It
[54:24] was a light room and people can pass
[54:26] through it for development. Wow. Do you
[54:29] see the message is designed to develop
[54:32] you from this negative back to what God
[54:36] had of you to begin with. That's why I
[54:40] need the message is for development.
[54:43] Character development. Come on. Bringing
[54:46] me back to be what God had me to be to
[54:49] begin with. Wow. Amen. And am I always
[54:54] what I should be?
[54:56] Heavens no.
[54:58] But I tell you this, I certainly ain't
[55:00] what I was.
[55:01] [Music]
[55:03] And it's a developing. See, had you had
[55:06] you been birthed? Now, there's a there's
[55:08] a great story in the Bible. I won't
[55:09] preach the whole book because I don't
[55:10] have time this morning. But I but I find
[55:12] it rather interesting when you read the
[55:15] book of Esther. How many read the book
[55:16] of Esther? It's a great book. And some
[55:18] of you probably sold films on it and
[55:20] things. It's a great book. But the thing
[55:23] about Esther that I love so much is that
[55:26] Esther was not born in a king's palace.
[55:30] Right? She was birthed as an orphan and
[55:33] was raised by her uncle Mori. Amen. In
[55:36] other words, she didn't have any raising
[55:39] that would make a queen out of her.
[55:42] But there become an availability for a
[55:45] queen when somebody else refused to.
[55:48] Yeah. Isn't that something? When Vastie
[55:50] said she wouldn't go in the presence of
[55:52] the king, brother Bam said it's much
[55:54] like they won't today. He said they
[55:55] denied the Lord with the fament of the
[55:58] spiritual uh uh the spiritual sexual
[56:00] affair with her Lord and they won't go
[56:02] into the message. He said, so what
[56:05] happened was he says because of their
[56:07] refusal, they were put away. And he said
[56:10] he began to seek someone to fill her
[56:12] place. Amen. And that's exactly how the
[56:16] Bible said, "Go in the highways and the
[56:18] byways and compel them to come." That's
[56:21] the part we come out of. Amen. He went
[56:24] he he he went outside the royal palace.
[56:27] Amen. And begin to look for things. And
[56:29] I I'll give you a short synopsis of this
[56:31] that there was about 120 different
[56:33] countries that that this man was king
[56:35] over. So they pulled virgins from 120
[56:38] nations. Now, if you don't think there
[56:41] wasn't some ideas coming in that palace,
[56:45] can you imagine 120 different ways?
[56:47] Amen. I don't know how many girls from
[56:49] each kingdom, but 120 different ways
[56:52] from every kingdom was coming into that
[56:54] palace. Amen. So, there was at least 120
[56:57] different ways to do your hair, 120
[57:00] different ways to wear your shoes, 120
[57:02] different ways, paint, no paint. Was it
[57:04] Amen. Hair up, hair down? Amen. You you
[57:06] you see there's there's so many opinions
[57:10] when they came, but the king himself had
[57:14] something in mind.
[57:17] See, it wasn't the people that was
[57:19] coming. It wasn't what they thought. It
[57:22] was the king that was doing the calling.
[57:25] That's what he thought. And as he began
[57:28] to think, look what he did to to be able
[57:30] to filter it out. I, brother Dallas, I
[57:32] love the Bible, how God does things to
[57:34] filter it out. He just put one man over
[57:36] it, right? Because when you got more
[57:39] than one man, you got a lot more
[57:41] opinions. Amen. So what the king did is
[57:44] he took a man, I think his name is Hagi,
[57:47] and he took the man aside and he shared
[57:50] with that man the secrets of his mind.
[57:54] You know, like he shared what I'd like
[57:57] out of a girl. I'd like her to wear my
[58:00] goodness. you know, maybe she'd have a
[58:02] white gown and I I I don't like them old
[58:04] big high heels and things and and you
[58:06] you put paint on a barn, not on a woman.
[58:09] So, I don't like a lot of paint on it.
[58:11] And you know, if if you paint her up
[58:14] good and I look at her, she'll wake up
[58:16] in the morning, she won't be the same
[58:17] person. So, I I don't want to be fooled.
[58:20] I I want to know what I'm buying.
[58:24] Well, let's go back to the Bible now.
[58:29] So he shares his secrets.
[58:33] Only he knows. Only the king knows the
[58:37] girl he's dreamed about. Only he knows
[58:39] the one that is the very apple of his
[58:42] eye. The one that not the one he had,
[58:44] the one he dreams of. Right? And watch
[58:47] what he does. He transfers this
[58:50] information into this man. And all these
[58:53] girls have to come through this one
[58:55] William Brham. Right.
[58:59] Come on. If you don't if you don't like
[59:01] the message,
[59:03] you you go to the Lord how you want to.
[59:09] But there's only one man got the job to
[59:12] tell us what the bride's going to look
[59:14] like.
[59:15] There was only one man with a vision
[59:17] beyond the curtain. One man with a
[59:20] vision of that bride in her procession.
[59:24] And look what happens. He goes into all
[59:27] of them and and you know what he does is
[59:28] he tells them that they can have and the
[59:30] royalty the king the ability that he has
[59:33] to give to them. He tells them they can
[59:35] take anything they want in with them.
[59:37] You can dress however you want. I'll
[59:38] give you gold or pearls or I I'll
[59:40] supply. See the king could supply them
[59:42] whatever they needed and they could get
[59:44] it right out of the message. You know
[59:46] they they could take it right out of the
[59:47] message. You know two and polygamy and
[59:49] they they could take it right out of the
[59:51] me they could take whatever they wanted
[59:52] but they could take it right out of the
[59:53] message. You know, seven thunders is
[59:55] virtues. You know, they they just get it
[59:57] right there. You know, they brother
[59:59] Ram's coming back and Joseph a prophet.
[1:00:00] We just started to play tapes. You can
[1:00:02] you can take all that really and you can
[1:00:04] find a little spot in the message
[1:00:06] and you can dress yourself up in that
[1:00:09] and you can to go into the king to it.
[1:00:12] But the Bible says they had one night
[1:00:14] with him and if he didn't choose them,
[1:00:16] they become concubines.
[1:00:19] But there was only one woman going to be
[1:00:20] that bride.
[1:00:22] But this little queen, Hadesa, actually
[1:00:25] changed her name to Esther, meaning
[1:00:27] star. She came to that man and she said
[1:00:30] to him, "I'll only go in with whatever
[1:00:33] you provide."
[1:00:36] Oh, that's the ticket. That's the
[1:00:39] ticket. I'll only wear what you say to
[1:00:42] wear. I'll only take in the way you
[1:00:45] dress me. How many knows, Brother Bam
[1:00:47] said, "If I could get her to stand
[1:00:49] still,
[1:00:51] if I could get her to quit getting her
[1:00:52] own ideas, I would dress her."
[1:00:56] My goodness, to have a prophet that has
[1:00:59] ascended into the mind of God to come
[1:01:01] back and to tell you, "Stand still. I'll
[1:01:04] get you ready. I'll get you ready for
[1:01:06] that meeting." And you know this, if a
[1:01:08] God's prophet gets you ready, brother,
[1:01:11] you will not be denied.
[1:01:14] How we could sing that song this
[1:01:15] morning. I will not be denied. How could
[1:01:19] he deny his own thought?
[1:01:23] How could he deny his own thinking?
[1:01:26] I
[1:01:28] let me to try to explain. I I'll say it
[1:01:31] like to you like this. Brother Brandman
[1:01:33] in his second pull. Amen. He he just
[1:01:35] never missed. Brother man, I love the
[1:01:37] second pull. I go back and listen to
[1:01:39] lots and lots and lots of the prayer
[1:01:41] lines and I draw from them and and I
[1:01:43] hear brother Brandham and the thing I
[1:01:45] love about it is even his critics will
[1:01:47] say he never missed one time.
[1:01:52] So if you was sitting in William
[1:01:53] Brandham's meetings and I know you're
[1:01:54] not thinking about it, but let's just
[1:01:56] say brother Ben, Brother Brandham talked
[1:01:57] about you. I'm not trying to discern
[1:01:58] you. And he's talked to you and he said,
[1:02:00] "Look here." He said, "You know, you're
[1:02:01] thinking about a white Ford and you want
[1:02:02] a new truck and and it's going to be so
[1:02:04] much and and and this whole room
[1:02:08] would know what was on your mind."
[1:02:10] Nobody in here would guess if Brother
[1:02:12] Brandham was telling us what he's
[1:02:13] thinking. They'd just walk away going,
[1:02:15] "We know what Ben's got on his mind."
[1:02:18] because it wouldn't be brother Brandham
[1:02:20] guessing your thought.
[1:02:22] He's repeating your own thought.
[1:02:25] Right? That's the second pull. But the
[1:02:29] third pull was a discerning of the heart
[1:02:32] of God. So when he said God thinks this
[1:02:35] and God thinks this, it wasn't what
[1:02:38] brother Brandham thought he was
[1:02:40] thinking.
[1:02:42] It was a discerning and a revealing of
[1:02:45] his true thought.
[1:02:48] Amen. So if you put on the thought of
[1:02:50] God, how could God reject his very
[1:02:53] thought?
[1:02:56] My goodness. Amen. What was going on?
[1:02:59] Was Esther not being born in a royal
[1:03:02] house.
[1:03:04] She's being prepared for a royal house.
[1:03:08] And you wasn't born in your theophony.
[1:03:12] But you're prepared to return.
[1:03:16] Amen. In the presence of God as the
[1:03:18] bride of Christ. Now, now get it. I I I
[1:03:23] believe the the reality here is really
[1:03:25] laying in the idea
[1:03:28] that this man was given the privilege
[1:03:32] that Esther rejected all of her own
[1:03:34] abilities.
[1:03:37] And she says, "I don't even have a
[1:03:39] thought coming.
[1:03:41] I'll take whatever you say is right."
[1:03:43] Amen. And by having that kind of
[1:03:46] attitude and spirit,
[1:03:48] she became the product of the very mind
[1:03:53] of this king. That's right. Dressed.
[1:03:57] Yeah. He's never seen her yet, but she's
[1:04:01] wearing his thoughts.
[1:04:03] He's never seen her, but she's literally
[1:04:07] his thoughts in flesh.
[1:04:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can you imagine
[1:04:13] when this uh this porter, this uh this
[1:04:16] prophet would introduce these women to
[1:04:19] this great king? Can you imagine? He he
[1:04:22] he opens the door, says, "Here, king.
[1:04:24] This is Miss Methodist." And she walks
[1:04:26] in. My goodness, the eyeliner and the
[1:04:28] hair dyes and the high heels and the And
[1:04:31] he looks up and says,
[1:04:33] "That don't look nothing." Yeah.
[1:04:36] Still carrying trinitarian baptisms,
[1:04:39] pagan ideas, just swarmed and robed in
[1:04:43] that don't even look close.
[1:04:46] Then here she comes. He opens up the
[1:04:48] door to Miss Pentecost. You know, man,
[1:04:50] she she's right there. She real close
[1:04:53] now. She watched a lot. She was pretty
[1:04:55] close to the right one. Yeah. Wow. But
[1:04:58] you know what? She still held some
[1:04:59] doctrines.
[1:05:02] She still kept some of her ideas and she
[1:05:05] was she was wearing them. Do you I'll
[1:05:09] just Well, I'm just going to preach. Let
[1:05:12] me just let me just turn my back here.
[1:05:16] But do you know brother Brandham said
[1:05:17] there was a woman in a dream came I
[1:05:19] think it was to his mother said she was
[1:05:21] wearing them high heel shoes and said
[1:05:23] she told brother Brandham she could do
[1:05:24] what she wanted to. And brother Bam
[1:05:27] said, "I I seen I believe he said I seen
[1:05:29] her walking up three steps and she made
[1:05:32] all three steps in them high heels." He
[1:05:34] said, "But when she headed out across
[1:05:36] that razor edge of the word, there she
[1:05:38] fell off." Do you see that? You can come
[1:05:40] up them three steps even to the baptism.
[1:05:43] Yeah. But when it comes to walking that
[1:05:45] word, when it comes to living that word,
[1:05:48] that's where Eve fell off. But this
[1:05:51] bride will not fail there.
[1:05:55] Why won't she fall? Because she is the
[1:05:57] word.
[1:05:59] The prophet has created this.
[1:06:03] I am not ashamed of the message of
[1:06:05] William Brandham. It is what created my
[1:06:08] thinking. It's what created my ideas and
[1:06:11] my decisions.
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:14] You may not appreciate it now, but you
[1:06:16] appreciate in his presence.
[1:06:18] And I remember I I imagine when he opens
[1:06:21] that door and and he says to Esther,
[1:06:24] "Come on in. I want you to meet the
[1:06:25] king."
[1:06:28] When she walked in, that king,
[1:06:33] he wiped his eyes, his little hearts
[1:06:36] pounding,
[1:06:39] and he can't figure out, is this woman
[1:06:41] real? Wow. Is she really for real? Is
[1:06:45] she real or is she fake?
[1:06:47] She's been in his mind so long for 6,000
[1:06:51] years. She's been trapped in the mind.
[1:06:54] But after all of these ages, after all
[1:06:56] this time now, that what's in the mind
[1:06:59] of God has been poured into the flesh
[1:07:04] of the bride. Now, you said, "Brother
[1:07:05] Wayne, what's the bride look like?
[1:07:07] What's what what's really been on the
[1:07:08] mind of God for 6,000 years? You want me
[1:07:11] to give you a shock treatment just for a
[1:07:12] moment? Put your seat belt out on now.
[1:07:15] Take a look around this building this
[1:07:17] morning.
[1:07:18] Glory to God. Hey, you may not be
[1:07:20] impressed, but God is. You may not think
[1:07:23] she's finished, but God does. Amen. God
[1:07:26] has brought this bride to the place that
[1:07:29] the third pool has been set over her,
[1:07:31] and she is called the bride of Jesus
[1:07:35] Christ. You may not be impressed with
[1:07:38] one another, but angels are standing
[1:07:40] back looking saying, "That's the queen
[1:07:42] of heaven come walking you." Glory.
[1:07:46] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:07:47] Hallelujah. I got a quote on it. By the
[1:07:49] way, Brother Bram said, "The very hinder
[1:07:50] parts of God's mind has now been
[1:07:51] unfolded into the flesh of this bride."
[1:07:56] Glory be to God. What is it? It's God
[1:07:59] himself becoming tangible. His mind has
[1:08:02] become tangible upon this church. Now,
[1:08:06] now it's amazing to me because what what
[1:08:09] we're really dealing with is the bride's
[1:08:11] feast and how she has learned and been
[1:08:14] taught to step into that bride authority
[1:08:16] that has been given to her. The same as
[1:08:18] Esther went through a training ground to
[1:08:21] come into her royalty once she become
[1:08:23] queen. Amen. Once she was accepted, she
[1:08:25] was crowned. She was crowned. Her spirit
[1:08:28] was crowned with headship and she was
[1:08:30] given royal apparel and she was seated
[1:08:33] as the queen of that country. You know
[1:08:35] the problem with Esther? She didn't know
[1:08:37] who she was even in that time. She still
[1:08:41] had not realized the amount of authority
[1:08:45] and the strength she had in the kingdom
[1:08:47] she was existing in. So God allowed him
[1:08:50] to have a God allowed her to have a have
[1:08:53] a enemy called Hmon, which was which was
[1:08:55] a longtime enemy. But but the beauty is
[1:08:59] that God had had hid
[1:09:02] in that little Esther, that Jew seed,
[1:09:06] but hadn't revealed yet who she was.
[1:09:09] Yeah. And Hmon decided he would kill
[1:09:12] every Jew,
[1:09:14] every Jew in the nation. I'll just kill
[1:09:16] them all. Now, here's the here's the
[1:09:18] reality to it. I imagine he went home
[1:09:20] one day and his wife said to him, "I'll
[1:09:22] tell you this. You better hope. You
[1:09:25] better hope that that Morai guy you're
[1:09:27] mad at ain't the same seed of that
[1:09:30] Abraham race
[1:09:33] because there's things that have been
[1:09:35] done with them people for years that you
[1:09:36] can't overcome them.
[1:09:39] And when you realize that the queen seed
[1:09:42] and the bride seed is the same seed.
[1:09:46] It doesn't matter how many enemies come
[1:09:49] to destroy her. She will never be
[1:09:53] destroyed.
[1:09:56] Now, it's a it's an amazing story and we
[1:09:58] don't have time for the whole story
[1:09:59] today,
[1:10:02] but because of where she was placed and
[1:10:04] under the authority that she was, Hmon
[1:10:07] actually got some laws passed that the
[1:10:09] Jewish race was going to be killed on a
[1:10:11] certain day. Yeah. And Moriah got a
[1:10:15] message to Esther
[1:10:18] and he said to her, said, "Listen now,
[1:10:20] you're going to have to speak now."
[1:10:22] Yeah.
[1:10:24] Yeah, you're going to have to open your
[1:10:27] voice now.
[1:10:29] God has done all of this to get you to
[1:10:33] this position.
[1:10:35] But you can't be quiet since you're
[1:10:37] here, right?
[1:10:39] God's done all of this to position the
[1:10:41] church. But once you get there, it's not
[1:10:44] a time to be silent. Your voice is the
[1:10:48] voice of mercy to the age you're living
[1:10:51] in. And remember, she said, "The king
[1:10:53] ain't even asked me to come in in 30
[1:10:55] days. And if I try to go in uninvited,
[1:10:58] that I'm going to die." And remember
[1:11:00] what Mori told her. Yeah. He said,
[1:11:02] "You're not safe even in the king's
[1:11:04] house." He said, "God will deliver these
[1:11:07] Jews somehow."
[1:11:09] But how do you know it's not for such a
[1:11:11] time that you've been raised up? For
[1:11:13] such a time like this that you have been
[1:11:15] raised up. Have you ever thought that
[1:11:17] God raised you for such a time like this
[1:11:19] one? For such a time that God knew he
[1:11:23] was putting you in a position for such a
[1:11:25] time as when it needed your voice when
[1:11:28] you needed to speak up when things
[1:11:30] needed to amen to have a strength. Amen.
[1:11:32] It was such a time like this one is the
[1:11:35] reason that God has put you. This is not
[1:11:37] a time to buckle to pressure. This is
[1:11:40] not a time to lay down your convictions
[1:11:42] and and just forget what the me but God
[1:11:45] put you here for a time like this one
[1:11:49] because he has prepared you and
[1:11:51] positioned you and he knows who you are
[1:11:53] and what you're here to do. Listen, I I
[1:11:56] think it's an amazing story when you get
[1:11:58] to looking at it. Brother Bam said it
[1:11:59] like this. He said, "See what it was."
[1:12:02] Amen. as she had to go into the presence
[1:12:04] of that king. Now, she's been in his
[1:12:06] presence one time, but since the last
[1:12:08] time she's been there, something has
[1:12:09] convinced her that she's afraid to go
[1:12:12] back again. And I I just love this uh I
[1:12:14] just love this portion to think that she
[1:12:17] is pressed to go into his presence
[1:12:21] because only in his presence is life.
[1:12:24] It's the only way she's going to be able
[1:12:25] to help her people.
[1:12:27] Now, see, there are times and there are
[1:12:30] seasons that you can sit. Yeah. There
[1:12:34] there are times that you can just sit
[1:12:36] by. It's it's okay. There's times you
[1:12:38] can do that. Yeah. But there are other
[1:12:40] times
[1:12:42] to sit is to die. That's right. There
[1:12:45] are other times to stay quiet. Yeah. Is
[1:12:49] to perish. Listen,
[1:12:51] I I I was looking I was looking at this
[1:12:53] and Brother Brandham, if you ever if you
[1:12:55] ever really enjoy studying phrases, you
[1:12:58] study this phrase of Brother Brandham.
[1:12:59] And brother Bram says these words, "If I
[1:13:02] was in your place." So, it's a direct
[1:13:05] it's a direct uh uh uh advice of a
[1:13:09] prophet. if I was in your place. And
[1:13:12] he's talking to a lady who's dying on a
[1:13:15] cot and he said, "If I was in your
[1:13:17] place, if I was in your place, I would
[1:13:21] get up off of that cot this morning."
[1:13:24] Amen. He tells a man who has cancer in
[1:13:26] his body, he said, "Do you believe me to
[1:13:28] be God's prophet?" The man said, "I do."
[1:13:30] He said, "Believing that if I was you,"
[1:13:33] he said, "I would get up off of that cot
[1:13:35] and take it home and testify that I'm
[1:13:37] healed. If you lay there, you're going
[1:13:40] to die.
[1:13:42] You see, there's times when you got to
[1:13:44] get gumption about you. If you lay down,
[1:13:46] you're going to die. If you lay down and
[1:13:48] you say, "This is more than I can take
[1:13:50] and I can't overcome and this this
[1:13:53] pressure in this season, and I just
[1:13:55] can't." You're going to die there. Get
[1:13:57] up. If I was you, I would get up and
[1:14:01] say, "God is my victory. God is my
[1:14:05] healer."
[1:14:07] You can get up from that place. You say,
[1:14:09] "Preacher, what are you talking about?"
[1:14:11] Brother uses this phrase, "If I was
[1:14:13] you." And he says, "If I was you, I
[1:14:15] would be like them lepers that was in
[1:14:17] Samaria." Y'all remember down in Samaria
[1:14:20] when when the Syrian army besieged them.
[1:14:23] And the Bible said there was such a
[1:14:24] famine. I'm still on my subject. There
[1:14:26] was such a famine in that day that for
[1:14:28] 80 shekels of silver, you could buy the
[1:14:32] head of a donkey. And for I think it was
[1:14:34] four shekels of silver, you could buy
[1:14:36] some dove dung. Amen. An unclean animal.
[1:14:40] They weren't eating the hams no more.
[1:14:41] They weren't eating the tenderloins no
[1:14:43] more. They wasn't only eating unclean
[1:14:45] things. They were eating the head of
[1:14:47] unclean things. They were to dove dung
[1:14:50] because there was a great famine in the
[1:14:52] land. I tell you one worse than this
[1:14:54] one. Amen. There was a woman cried out
[1:14:56] to the king and said, "Oh king, hear
[1:14:57] me." He said, "What's the matter?" She
[1:14:59] said, "Listen, there's a matter between
[1:15:01] me and my my sister. We agreed that we
[1:15:03] would eat one another's babies.
[1:15:06] We boiled my baby yesterday and ate it
[1:15:09] and today we're supposed to eat hers and
[1:15:11] she's running off. And that's just a a
[1:15:13] synopsis of the story. It's a kind of a
[1:15:14] paraphrasing, but they were eating one
[1:15:17] another's children.
[1:15:19] The famine was so bad they were
[1:15:21] devouring their own people.
[1:15:27] But there happened to be a prophet in
[1:15:29] the land. Hallelujah. And brother Ram
[1:15:32] said, Elisha, Bible records, Elisha was
[1:15:34] over there and he was setting the king
[1:15:35] come running in. The king said, "Hold
[1:15:37] yourself now." He said, "By this time
[1:15:39] tomorrow." And he began to prophesy that
[1:15:42] would be bread of plenty. There would be
[1:15:44] corn of plenty. And he began to say, I
[1:15:46] think for like a just a few sheles,
[1:15:48] you'll have plenty of corn, plenty of
[1:15:50] bread. And he starts he starts giving
[1:15:52] these great numerous abundance ideas by
[1:15:56] this time tomorrow. And the people in
[1:15:58] the room could not understand how could
[1:16:01] we go from this kind of famine to this
[1:16:03] kind of abundance. How could this
[1:16:06] happen? Famine to abundance. But that
[1:16:09] was four lepers sitting at the gate that
[1:16:11] was sitting there in the middle of the
[1:16:12] night. And the Syrian army was out there
[1:16:14] and they begin to say to themselves,
[1:16:16] "Why did we sit here till we die? Why
[1:16:20] sit here? Amen. Sure, we're going to
[1:16:22] starve here. Amen. We might die there,
[1:16:25] but at least we got a chance." So in the
[1:16:27] middle of the night, they rose up and
[1:16:29] begin to go out to the enemy's camp to
[1:16:31] take something to get some food that
[1:16:33] they would be able to eat. But lo, in
[1:16:35] the middle of the night, God took his
[1:16:37] angels and begin to rustle it. And the
[1:16:39] Syrian army, an entire army, run off and
[1:16:44] left their food and their corn and their
[1:16:48] flour. Amen. And these lepers had
[1:16:50] nothing. But because they didn't set
[1:16:53] still, they went from nothing to an
[1:16:55] abundance. They couldn't have eat all
[1:16:57] that food in years. Oh, let me tell you,
[1:17:00] this leper, this sin sick man got up one
[1:17:04] day and I said, "I don't know about this
[1:17:06] message, but I know I'm going to die in
[1:17:08] the shape I'm in." And I went into the
[1:17:11] presence of God. And I found that I went
[1:17:13] from famine of denomination. I went from
[1:17:16] the famine of sin into the abundance of
[1:17:19] the opening of seven seals where we're
[1:17:21] feeding this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why sit here
[1:17:28] till we die? Why sit there and say the
[1:17:30] seals ain't open and the word ain't been
[1:17:33] revealed? Why sit there and let the fear
[1:17:36] come on you? Don't fear. This is the
[1:17:39] third pull.
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:46] So Esther,
[1:17:49] why sit till you die?
[1:17:54] You might die in his presence, but
[1:17:56] you'll surely die if you don't go.
[1:17:59] Brother, she ran into the presence of
[1:18:01] that king and there was one law that
[1:18:03] could save her. Yeah. There was one rule
[1:18:05] that could save her is if he extended
[1:18:08] his scepter to her. Yeah. He had a
[1:18:10] golden scepter and if he just extended
[1:18:12] it to her, the curse was off. The laws
[1:18:14] was overcome. He superseded everything
[1:18:17] with that extension of grace. Oh,
[1:18:19] brother. When she broke out in that
[1:18:21] room, she was taking a chance. She was
[1:18:24] taking a chance to walk in there. But
[1:18:26] that wasn't just a king on that throne.
[1:18:29] That was her husband.
[1:18:31] Hallelujah. That wasn't just a king.
[1:18:34] That's her husband. And let me tell you,
[1:18:36] he's not just Jesus this morning. He's
[1:18:39] our lover. He's our husband. He's
[1:18:41] everything to you and I this morning.
[1:18:44] Yes, we can run to his presence. Yes, we
[1:18:47] can go in there where he's standing and
[1:18:50] he extends a golden scepter. Hallelujah.
[1:18:53] Hallelujah. I tell you what, brother
[1:18:54] Brandon said, he said, don't be like
[1:18:56] those four lepers sitting there. He
[1:18:58] said, I'd take off and run. He said, but
[1:19:01] they were taking a chance by going to
[1:19:02] the enemy's camp. He said, but there is
[1:19:05] no chance for you this morning. He said,
[1:19:07] "You're running to the presence of God
[1:19:09] where you've been invited to come."
[1:19:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:15] Brother Nathan, he took that golden
[1:19:18] scepter and said, "Come and take it.
[1:19:20] Come and take it." You know what that
[1:19:23] turned into? A feast.
[1:19:26] [Applause]
[1:19:27] A feast. And in that feast with the king
[1:19:31] and with the enemy, guess what happened?
[1:19:33] Yeah. Come on. Her identity is revealed
[1:19:37] in the presence of the king. Yeah. And
[1:19:39] the enemy is overcome in the presence of
[1:19:43] the king.
[1:19:44] And they can't change the laws. So they
[1:19:47] just put in a new law that supersedes
[1:19:50] the old law. Come on, church. Amen.
[1:19:52] Y'all know y'all know that gravity is a
[1:19:55] powerful law, but aerodynamics
[1:19:57] supersedes that law. And so is it that
[1:20:00] this bride, we know law is it's
[1:20:02] powerful. Legalism is powerful, but
[1:20:05] grace supersedes it. It super abounds
[1:20:08] it. Amen. The grace of God that brought
[1:20:11] this message to you and I. Oh, the grace
[1:20:13] of God that extended a golden scepter to
[1:20:16] you and I and said, "Come and take it.
[1:20:19] Come and take it." And when she took it,
[1:20:21] it was given to her. You own half of
[1:20:23] this kingdom. This scepter says I own
[1:20:27] half of this kingdom. Come on, church.
[1:20:29] This message, this book has opened up
[1:20:32] and gave me the title deed to the
[1:20:34] kingdom and I'm joint heir to every
[1:20:36] promise of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:20:39] Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] Glory. I was sitting in my study this
[1:20:44] morning just going so going going over
[1:20:45] these feeding on the things of mind of
[1:20:47] God and wondering Lord should I even go
[1:20:49] this way?
[1:20:50] So I started studying it a little bit
[1:20:53] and and I preached on Estra and you
[1:20:56] that's heard me preach on forgive me but
[1:20:57] Jonathan I think I took the world with
[1:20:59] it 10 years ago and we went preached it
[1:21:01] in Pawne and preached it in Tulsa and
[1:21:03] preached it we preached it everywhere.
[1:21:04] Preached it in Canada. I I ain't
[1:21:06] preached on it in a few years so some of
[1:21:08] you new people it's brand new to you I
[1:21:11] hope.
[1:21:13] But something I never really got into
[1:21:16] was the feast of Purum.
[1:21:18] And this morning I was reading on that
[1:21:20] feast and and what what let me tell you
[1:21:23] what had happened. The feast the feast
[1:21:26] with the king became where there could
[1:21:28] be a law and the law that was given was
[1:21:31] a law that they could defend themselves.
[1:21:33] Yeah. Yeah. And there was there was a
[1:21:35] day before that they would the Jews
[1:21:38] would all be killed.
[1:21:40] He made a law that they could attack
[1:21:43] Yeah. the people who were going to kill
[1:21:45] them Yeah. and take their possessions.
[1:21:48] Yeah. Yeah. So they would possess their
[1:21:51] oppressors. Yes. Come on. Now it was
[1:21:54] supposed to be the Jews would be killed
[1:21:56] and all their possessions taken, but the
[1:21:59] word changed it and took the power from
[1:22:02] the attacker
[1:22:04] and gave it to the defender. And under
[1:22:07] that scepter, she became an offense
[1:22:10] rather than a defense. So now she could
[1:22:14] kill her enemy and take their
[1:22:16] possessions
[1:22:19] and it it went through the nation. It
[1:22:21] went through the the great regions of
[1:22:24] that Persian king of what had happened.
[1:22:27] And the Bible tells us that they they
[1:22:29] actually had a feast. Now y'all know
[1:22:30] that about the feast of Passover. It
[1:22:32] commemorates Exodus and the feast of
[1:22:34] tabernacles and the feast of the
[1:22:36] trumpets and the feast of the
[1:22:37] atonements. There's all those feast. But
[1:22:39] this feast of Purum was a joyous and a
[1:22:42] victorious where they just begin to get
[1:22:45] joyous and they begin to eat and they
[1:22:47] begin to say, "We victored over Hmon."
[1:22:49] And they begin to send out gifts one to
[1:22:52] the other. And they had two days of
[1:22:54] great celebration. It was so great that
[1:22:56] when it was finished, Esther told the
[1:22:58] king said, "Let the 10 sons of Hmon be
[1:23:01] brought out here and hung on the gallows
[1:23:02] in front of the people. And from this
[1:23:04] day forward, every year we will
[1:23:06] commemorate this time." And that's why
[1:23:09] it's called the feast of Purum Purr. The
[1:23:11] feast of Pum. And they actually even
[1:23:13] still to this day, they still celebrate
[1:23:16] this feast. And what they do Yes, sir.
[1:23:18] It's pretty powerful. I I read all about
[1:23:20] it on Google this morning.
[1:23:23] And what they do, what they do is they
[1:23:26] make diamond shaped or pyramid-shaped uh
[1:23:29] pastries and eat them pyramid-shaped
[1:23:31] pastries and give gifts one to the other
[1:23:34] like they did back then. But then they
[1:23:37] read the story of Esther and whenever
[1:23:40] the name of Hmon comes up. I don't know
[1:23:43] where Ronnie is this morning, but how
[1:23:45] many seen the video he brought back from
[1:23:46] Mexico of the brother swinging the
[1:23:48] little rack ratchet? It went and anybody
[1:23:52] ever saw them? They're like a little
[1:23:54] swing thing and it it it rattles when
[1:23:56] you swing it. Man, it's just an
[1:23:57] overwhelming noise. where they pass them
[1:24:00] out among the crowd and whenever the
[1:24:03] name Hmon is spoken, they spin those
[1:24:06] things real hard that it would drown out
[1:24:09] the sound of his name among the
[1:24:11] congregation. In other words, when his
[1:24:14] name come up, they'd shout so loud that
[1:24:16] you couldn't even hear his name because
[1:24:18] they didn't want his name mentioned
[1:24:19] anymore. And and then then they would
[1:24:22] take, and this is what's really cool,
[1:24:23] they would take chalk and they would
[1:24:25] write it on the bottom of their feet and
[1:24:27] and they would when the name Hmon was
[1:24:29] mentioned, they just start stomping
[1:24:31] their feet and they would do it until
[1:24:33] the name Hmon was no longer visible on
[1:24:37] the bottom of their shoes. Well, I tell
[1:24:39] you this morning, maybe some of you have
[1:24:41] got cancer and you need to ride it on
[1:24:43] them shoes this morning. Maybe some of
[1:24:45] you been fighting with nervousness and
[1:24:47] you want to ride it on your shoe this
[1:24:49] morning. I think you could just begin to
[1:24:51] stomp on that devil. Let me say this. We
[1:24:54] are not here, amen, to just defend
[1:24:56] ourselves. But we are here as sons and
[1:25:00] daughters of God to go to the devil's
[1:25:02] camp and get back the joy that has been
[1:25:06] taken. To get back the health that has
[1:25:09] been taken to get back the joy and the
[1:25:12] peace and the love and the forgiveness
[1:25:15] we don't have to sit still and take what
[1:25:17] the devil gives. We can go and
[1:25:20] offensively take this morning.
[1:25:22] Hallelujah. I believe this morning this
[1:25:26] is the feast of the bride. Hallelujah.
[1:25:30] Stand to your feet with me this morning.
[1:25:32] Hallelujah. I believe it. We ought to
[1:25:35] practice it once in a while. Just say
[1:25:37] the name Lucifer. Amen. And just drown
[1:25:39] his name out.
[1:25:42] Come on, brother. One of these days I'm
[1:25:44] going to stand there with my Lord. Amen.
[1:25:47] And we're going to take that devil and
[1:25:48] throw him in the lake of fire where he
[1:25:50] will never come again. That's right. Oh,
[1:25:53] what a holy convocation it's going to
[1:25:55] be.
[1:25:57] What a holy convocation it's going to
[1:25:59] be. Yes, sir.
[1:26:02] Yes, sir.
[1:26:04] I say it. I believe this morning we
[1:26:06] don't have to just sit and take it.
[1:26:09] If I was in your place, the prophet
[1:26:11] said,
[1:26:13] I would not lay there any longer. That's
[1:26:17] right. If I was in your place
[1:26:21] and I had a baby that's lost out here in
[1:26:24] this world, I wouldn't just sit on. I'd
[1:26:28] open my voice and I'd say, "God, I claim
[1:26:31] them in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:26:34] wouldn't just sit still. If I had a
[1:26:36] child this morning under some under some
[1:26:39] false doctrine somewhere trapped in a
[1:26:42] church with a famine going on. Amen. I'd
[1:26:45] say this morning aloud, God, I'll not
[1:26:47] sit here. I'll call the name. I'll ask
[1:26:49] you bring deliverance to him, Lord. In
[1:26:52] your precious name, Savior, I believe
[1:26:54] it. Amen. Amen. I don't believe we have
[1:26:58] to just sit.
[1:27:01] The book's been open. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:05] It gave us our authority. Yes. Can you
[1:27:08] imagine the transition that happened in
[1:27:10] that kingdom when they saw the queen
[1:27:13] go from this person that didn't know who
[1:27:15] she was, didn't know why she was there,
[1:27:18] just sat quiet, never said nothing till
[1:27:20] the time she realized the things that I
[1:27:23] say, they carry the weight of the king
[1:27:28] into half of my kingdom. Hallelujah. And
[1:27:30] I say this morning, brother Aiden, if I
[1:27:32] have the weight of that kind of words in
[1:27:34] my lips, I pray every young person in
[1:27:36] this building receive the Holy Ghost. If
[1:27:39] I'm granted to half of the kingdom, I
[1:27:41] pray the Holy Ghost fire would fill this
[1:27:43] church. Until every heart loves one
[1:27:45] another, until joy would sing out, till
[1:27:48] peace would return to every heart. I say
[1:27:50] we I adure that old devil of
[1:27:54] nervousness. I adure that demon of
[1:27:57] depression. I I say in the name of Jesus
[1:28:00] to half of the kingdom.
[1:28:02] In the name of Jesus,
[1:28:05] I believe it. Amen.
[1:28:08] Glory to God. Glory. Glory to God.
[1:28:14] Oh my. Right now with our hands lifted
[1:28:17] up, let's just do it. Let's say,
[1:28:18] "Father,
[1:28:21] we're not sitting still any longer,
[1:28:23] Lord. There's needs, Lord. There's needs
[1:28:25] among your people right here this
[1:28:27] morning. There's sicknesses in bodies,
[1:28:29] Lord. I pray that, Lord, they not set
[1:28:32] still this morning, but I pray they walk
[1:28:34] out into their healing. I pray, Father,
[1:28:36] that the cancer that would try to rid a
[1:28:38] body, I pray that it be broken this
[1:28:40] morning. The complexes that would hold
[1:28:43] your children, I pray they walk out of
[1:28:45] them this morning, Lord. I pray the
[1:28:47] little oddnesses and the feelings that
[1:28:49] get on us so easily, I pray, the Lord
[1:28:52] that you'd break the powers of them.
[1:28:53] Father, I pray the fear of this message
[1:28:56] would leave hearts this morning. Father,
[1:28:59] they would approach it, Lord, in a way
[1:29:01] to know that it's the food
[1:29:04] that would transform them.
[1:29:07] Oh, we believe you this morning, Lord.
[1:29:10] We believe your word, Father. In Jesus
[1:29:13] name. In Jesus name. Brother Ben.
[1:29:18] Hallelujah. In Jesus name.
[1:29:21] [Music]
[1:29:24] I've been singing
[1:29:28] we have glory since I laid
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:34] my burdens down.
[1:29:40] Glory. Glory.
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:46] I've been singing
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:51] since I left
[1:29:56] my burdens down.
[1:30:01] Well, glory, glory.

[1:31:20] I feel better. I feel better.
[1:31:25] So much better.
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:29] [Applause]

[1:31:34] Oh, since I lay.
[1:31:39] Amen. I feel better.
[1:31:45] So much better.
