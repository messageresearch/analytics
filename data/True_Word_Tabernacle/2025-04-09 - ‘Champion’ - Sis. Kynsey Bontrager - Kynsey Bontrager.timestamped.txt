[0:00] [Music]
[0:21] I've tried so hard to see
[0:25] it. Took me so long to believe
[0:30] it. And you choose someone like
[0:35] me to carry your
[0:40] victory. Perfection could never earn
[0:45] it. You give what we don't deserve.
[0:51] Man, you take the broken
[0:55] things and raise them to
[0:58] [Music]
[1:00] gloryy. You are my
[1:06] champion. Giants fall when you stand
[1:10] undefeated.
[1:12] Every battle you
[1:15] won, I am who you say I
[1:20] am. You crown me with
[1:24] confidence. I am
[1:27] seated in a heavenly place
[1:32] undefeated with the one who has
[1:35] conquered it all.
[1:42] Now I can finally see
[1:46] it. You're teaching me how to receive
[1:51] it. So let all the striving
[1:57] cease. This is my
[2:02] victory. You are my champion.
[2:08] Giants fall when you stand
[2:12] undefeated. Every battle you
[2:16] won. I am who you say I
[2:21] am. You crown me with confidence.
[2:26] I am
[2:27] seated in a heavenly place
[2:32] undefeated with the one who has
[2:36] conquered it
[2:38] [Music]
[2:42] all. When I lift my voice and
[2:48] shout, every wall comes crashing down. I
[2:54] have the
[2:57] authority Jesus has given me.
[3:04] When I open up my mouth,
[3:10] mirales start breaking out. I have the
[3:15] authority
[3:19] Jesus has given
[3:23] me. When
[3:26] I voice and
[3:28] shout, every wall comes crashing down. I
[3:34] have the
[3:38] authority Jesus has given
[3:43] me. When I open up my
[3:48] mouth,
[3:50] mirales start breaking out. I have the
[3:57] [Music]
[3:58] authority Jesus has given me.
[4:05] You are my
[4:09] champion. Giants fall when you stand
[4:15] undefeated. Every battle you
[4:19] won. I am who you say I
[4:24] am. You crown me with confidence.
[4:28] I am
[4:30] seated in a heavenly place
[4:35] undefeated with the one who has
[4:38] conquered it
[4:45] all. I am who you say I
[4:50] am. You crown me with confidence.
[4:54] I am
[4:56] seated in a
[4:58] heavenly place
[5:01] undefeated with the one who has
[5:05] conquered it
[5:07] [Music]
[5:11] all. I am who you say I
[5:16] am. You crown me with confidence.
[5:21] I am
[5:23] seated in a heavenly place
[5:28] undefeated with the one who has
[5:31] conquered it all.
[5:35] With the one who has conquered it all.
[5:40] Amen.
[5:41] [Applause]
