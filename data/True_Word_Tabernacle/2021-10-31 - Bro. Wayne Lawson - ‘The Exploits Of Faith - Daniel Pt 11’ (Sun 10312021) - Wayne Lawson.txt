come to the house of the Lord today and what an honor it is to be here and and to be able to to share in this special time amen and if we we go to the Book of Daniel this morning we' just like to look at Daniel the 11th chapter want take for just a few minutes in scripture and uh tremendous time amen and just want to read one verse from here Daniel CH 11 and verse 32 I'm skipped a whole chapter on on you um I'm I'm moving into inspiration here I I found some things that I just want to move forward into so but I I want to make this link here if I can Daniel chap 11 and verse 32 and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God they shall be strong and do exploits let's just bow our hearts father we thank you this morning we thank you by the grace Lord that you have given us in this life and Lord we thank you for a wonderful place this morning to worship we thank you Father for the ministry Lord that you have placed here in True Word Tabernacle to lead and and Lord to give them Grace to stand through all these years Lord and we we give you honor and praise for that this morning Lord we we understand the trials the tribulations and Lord to see the grace that you have put there we give you praise and honor this morning Lord we want to thank you for a word Lord that has been sent into this dispensation and we ask you Lord this morning that Lord for your people that have gathered here in this place may you bless them Father may you take your word and may you open it to each Heart Lord that it may be an influence in their life and give them Grace father now Lord Lord we're asking you for these things today in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you as you be seated this morning uh I'm want to uh take from this this morning I want to talk to you about the exploits of Faith uh I I'm going to be making some uh a movement uh from Daniel here and I'm going to be moving towards uh the third pool I want to maybe take a couple Services coming very soon here from this point that I'm that I'm looking today so hold that in your mind that we're talking about something uh in the in the very near future we're going to to to examine these areas of Daniel 11 Daniel 12 with the ministry in the Endtime concerning the opening of the word and the Power released under that in Daniel chapter 11 uh he said they that do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flattery but the people that do know their God shall be be strong the people that know their God uh shall be strong now according to Paul in the book of Ephesians Paul is the one that ties together the idea that the opening the eyes of the understanding or the bringing of knowledge is also the bringing of power so so it's uh you you can't separate power from understanding because there is power is in understanding when you uh when you go to it Ephesians chapter 1 we can read the 17th verse uh I did I don't know if I put that down if I did yeah for the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him now if you read the rest of that text you'll find out that in the of course it moves directly to the power of the Cross and then the power of the Resurrection which was the exhibition of the power of God was in the power of his resurrection uh that's how God exhibited his power when you say the power of God it was exhibited in the resurrection of Jesus Christ so when God gets ready to exploit give exploits or give exhibition of power it is an exhibition in the resurrection of Jesus that is the power of God is in Resurrection now when we look at this and see that the Lord maybe he increase our understanding and when he does it releases a holy ghost boldness in the church when when true understanding of the word word comes into your heart it will release an increase of understanding will also bring a boldness because you know where you're standing if you're not sure about something uh you'll be a little flaky concerning the point but if you know exactly where you're standing now you you know what I'm talking about you've argued with your brothers and your sisters maybe you got siblings at home and if you don't really know where you're at you back out of it but if you know you're right and you know where you're at it it it brings a different tenacity out of the person you know because there's a there's vigorous uh I know where I'm standing you know and that's and that's the thing is that when God sets the church in a place that they can understand then there's a boldness that's released and then the Unseen it brings it to the seene the things that are unseen or un uh uh out there in the fog it brings them to the scene and then it brings you understanding it'll bring you from glory to glory understanding will actually bring you into a an understanding beyond the current measure of where you are when understanding it level brings the level up or the measure of it the measure of your knowing him which takes the limitations off of your life and all of a sudden the understanding of God will make you understand that things that are impossible become possible and the deeper knowledge you have of God things are unlimited things are completely become impossible to you because there's no word that God speaks that that is void of power there's no way that God can say something that is void of power such as when that when the Gabriel talked to Mary and he said Thou shalt have a child and not know it a man and she said this is impossible basically and he says back to her but all things are possible with God Amen so in that translation of that in the Greek actually means that no word spoken is void of power so when God says something it has the power of fulfillment with it then when you bring the understanding of the word it releases the power of fulfillment in the life of the believer now uh the scripture says here in the Book of Daniel I found it very relevant that it says here that they the the people shall know their God now I'm I'm I guess maybe I I I I look into some of these things a little tightly because uh if this was speaking to just one individual it would say the person that knows their God shall do great exploits but the scripture doesn't read that it puts a plurality to them that know and them that do exploits so it's the plurality is the people now I'm not going to spend all the service on it but this we must understand that this is a body movement of the Bride of Jesus Christ so this isn't just a a holy man and and a People amen uh that's just uh enduring or just trying to watch the exercise and observation but it is God manifesting in the church now I say that because because there is an approach to the message of the hour that brother Ram done these things and that they're Way Out Of Reach of the bride of Christ but if God meant that then he would have put it in the scripture then he would have said well he that knows God he would have placed it in an individual but rather he placed it in a people which would mean an anointed body remember he said it was the anointed man but now it's the anointed people of God Amen now in saying that that that doesn't destroy the order of leadership of God by the way Brother Ray we're right behind you amen right behind you amen amen but but you see the direct order of of God Amen but but to say that that what's in the ministry or what's in the prophet would not be in the people would be a misstatement Amen in showing that God is Desiring a personal relationship with every individual in the church whether you're a widow woman whether you're a married woman whether you're a young girl or an older boy or teenager whatever you're state life is God desires an experience or a personal knowledge this is past the age of church you see it's the ending of the church age and it's the Bride of Jesus Christ which is a personal knowledge amen of God it is that that people shall know so there is a is a body movement of Christ that the people shall know that they will know to know is to learn or to perceive it's the Hebrew word used here means to recognize or to admit to know by experience to acknowledge to confess to be acquainted with to know to be skillful with to have knowledge of to be known or to be revealed amen it's it's the acquaintance it's it's a known so we we we find out of course he wants people to know him so so in this age we're living no means Amen to some people joining Church uh uh no means that we read about him in the Bible remember brother Bram says it over and over he'd be talking scripture with a theologian and they say well brother BR you don't know much about your Bible he said well but I know the author real well amen I've read books written by man that I have never met don't know them at all I don't know what they like to eat I don't know what they like way they like what they drink or the way they live or the car they drive or the nature if I met them I would have no way to entertain them because I have no clue of their personality or their character I'm Li to serve them steak when they like chicken I don't know them I've read their book amen but here brother random was and I of course read his book he said but I have a relationship with the author in other words brother brandom knew how to entertain him when he came into the house of God now there's people sitting here today maybe not with a Biblical theological order of every teaching in the Bible but this church knows how to entertain God when he comes into the building they know what he likes they they know how to bring his presence and then to hold him in the room a little while I don't know about y'all but I don't want to see God come amen but I want to make an atmosphere he wants to stay a while when he comes I want to see God come in amen and then feel such a welcome and you've done it you went to somebody's house and left the car running outside and they have such a way about them that an hour later you're like I need to go shut the car off cuz it made you feel so welcome amen and and and to think that God would visit this generation and we make him feel so welcome here amen he comes weekly he every time we come together he comes and meets and and he'll over I oh God I've seen it amen we're leaving church people still in here praying rejoicing because of the entertaining because they know him they know his nature they know what he likes and the desire of him amen they know him amen the brother Bram said it like this he said now we want to know him after the power of his resurrection that's the way we want to know him is in the power of his resurrection Amen brother B says see uh uh to know him is to know him is to have life to know him is to have life now other things I don't know about maybe uh maybe I don't identify as a smart man Paradox brother brandom actually discussing something him and brother Billy Paul was talking about he said Billy Paul said something about a song on the radio and brother brand said what song and he said brother he Billy Paul said to brother brandom he said well you don't know very much about anything besides just Christ do you and brother B said well that's all I want to know about he said that's all I want to know and these other things things I don't know about maybe I'm not a smart man I don't want to be a smart man I want to know him I don't want to be a smart man I want to know him amen and he said Paul said in the power of his resurrection that when he calls me I will come out from among the Dead I want the kind of relationship that he'll call me and I'll come out of the Grave amen amen that's the way Lazarus knew him amen he had a fellowship with him that when he called he heard his voice and understood that he meant him Paul says in Philippians chapter 3 and the 10th verse that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering may be made comfortable uh uh conformable unto death now to know him is not to know him by the word only amen that's the Cry of the world today is to know Christ and he said Paul said we should know him and to know Christ is life and when we knew him in the power of his resurrection now not to know him by word not to know him by word that all right but that's a long ways from being sufficient to know him by word we got to know him by the person of his resurrection am how many people sat in brother braham's meetings and read the Bible with him and said they believed it completely but the moment they seen the sign of the Resurrection didn't believe that sign because they didn't know him he said had you known me had you been of Abraham you would have loved me you would have loved me the way Abraham acted you would have acted the same way had you really known amen but you see now so there can't be just a word only experience there has got to be an experience with the person of the Resurrection amen you must be born again 1961 brother bam said the true word comes to the true prophet and he tells you the true word and you'll follow the true word and you'll get a true experience of the word so you're not just knowing him in the word but the word has an experience to know him in the experience of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become God's son so the power of the Resurrection is when the word comes into you and that word takes on life the word of God begins revolving right out of you because you are of his nature his Spirit and the works of God you will do in the shame 1965 brother R said we notice today amen people say well somebody says are you a Christian he says it's a very popular thing to say I'm a Christian but do you believe the word of God where it said these signs shall follow them that believe even ministers faces will begin to blush Are you ashamed to say of Divine Healing Are you ashamed of the Full Gospel Are you ashamed of a Pentecostal experience that's being ashamed of his word that's his word made flesh in you you see not just knowing by reading the word but an experience with the word means in a Pentecostal experience of knowing him in the power of his resurrection ction Amen in the upper room they were more than just reading about him they were experiencing him the light that had been in Jesus Christ was now in them in the power of the Resurrection Amen to receive the Holy Ghost is to receive an experience with god with a person with him to know his experience now I know people be you say the word Pentecost and they say well that's another age well the Pentecostal age was another age but Pentecost isn't experience and that was where we brother bam identified he said if we need ministers to preach the gospel and bring the church back to a Pentecost AG again or a Pentecost again excuse me bring them back to a Pentecost again we need ministers to preach the gospel and bring the church back to Pentecost again amen 1960 Eagle Ste his n we need preachers to preach the Pentecostal experience in the church amen I know people are getting shy of it because it it produces a mess and and people get messy amen but brother man said where is birth not a mess if it's in a hospital room if it's in your bedroom if it's in a b it doesn't matter it's always a mess and people today don't want the mess on their hand they don't want to deal with the babies they don't want to deal with the acts 238 tongue talking B they don't want to deal with somebody shouting and running the a so they're going to water it down and calm it down to just a word experience of reading and you believing but if you ever get the word of God it'll do do more than just believe it'll become a manifestation on the inside of you it'll shake things up amen it'll cause a mess in your home it'll cause a mess in your church it'll break the forms of your religion because God still uses the anointed word to change the lives of the people hey I tell you this I don't know about you but I welcome the experience of God to bring it to a hey man I love it to bring it to Pentecost again to bring it to an eagle experience there it is to bring it to an eagle experience we're not a bunch of Pentecostal chickens but we are eagles we are the Eagles of God we fly up there in a realm that man don't understand they don't know where we're getting our joy they don't know where we're getting our food they can't catch the Revelation they're in another age thinking about other things but we are having a Pentecostal experience in the bride age amen what is it we're moved by the Holy Ghost with power and with authority amen I tell you it's a experience it's Amen it's what the church needs we don't want to be chickens we want to be Eagles what the church needs is a is an eagle experience people say well I'm going to I want to be an eagle well to be an eagle it'll take a Pentecost experience people say well I I don't want to be the Shu brother bam said it's the wheat there's a Ministry on the earth that's just like the one that went into the ground back under a real Pentecostal experience the wheat and the eagle both is both a Pentecostal experience and I I've been around enough I understand that people use both eagle and wheat to explain why we don't have pentecost's experiences but it's a direct it is a direct contradiction to what a prophet taught see you can take a quote and take a Direction with that quote to make it mean something that it don't mean I tell you I'm not going in the direction of a bunch of dead formal church members I'm looking for the power of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ with an anointing with life and with truth amen amen I know we can take it the wrong directions but that's why we're directly behind a preacher that believes in the Full Gospel and the experience of God Amen this direction will end up in the changing of your mortal body it's an experience of the holy ghost power and anointing come on you're not going to read your way into no Rapture you're going to have to have an experience with a body changer somebody that can change your Adams if you don't even believe in Divine Healing how are you going to believe in a complete healing of the body I believe it ought to be preached I believe it ought to be believed and let the experience of God come in the church with anointing and with truth oh there's some people that believe they're God there's a people that know they're God yes sir they know him my sheep know my voice and a strange danger they will not follow amen yes sir do you say you said well preacher then does that separate it from the message brother B said it like this people that's believe in him know it unless they're constantly in the word now you can have an experience and not be a word experience you can have an experience and this is where it gets everybody because the Antichrist will be so close that the deceive the elected is possible so people ride that side of it and say even Antichrist speaks in tongues even the Antichrist has manifestations even the Antichrist but have you ever stopped to listen it said so much like it's so much like in other words the real believer that's what happens to him that's why they're impersonating it amen people well we don't want no dancing in the church because so and so danced and they fell into sin amen but you see what they were doing they were impersonating the real so if there is a if there is a false if there's an antichrist there is a real dance somewhere as a real shout somewhere as a real anointing somewhere I believe I'm in the middle of a bunch of eagles this morning and knows what the reality of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you won't sell us off as just a bunch of Pentecostals we are word born word believing Holy Ghost filled tongue talking Bible believing Church of the Living God and we will not apologize for it and we're not going to take it back and if I believe if it's morning I believe in the power of God for a reality do you see what it is amen now now if you're if you're can you can get experiences and them not be biblical experiences sure amen but when Peter did it he said this is that which Joel prophesied I tell you what it was a Bible experience they were having and the brother Ram says it like this he said the people believe in him how would they know him unless they're con stantly in the word to know what it is see if you get the right experience it'll put you in the word and while you're in the word you'll get a fellowship by the spirit to know what you're reading about remember remember the Bible said no man call me Lord except by the Holy Ghost unless a man's got the Holy Ghost all you're reading does you no good you're reading about somebody you're never going to meet and you can meet him and say I've cast out devils in thy name I've healed the sick in thy name he said but I never knew you I never knew you never knew me you never had that experience with me amen but now I I know that's what a prophet taught because what he said he said they prophesied my name he said there's the preacher he said preaching but denying the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes him a worker of iniquity knowing to get it and won't go it he said then he's a worker of iniquity and never knew him amen now the people that believe him are constantly in the word now watch he's going to go directly he's going to go directly to the Book of Daniel he he said now that Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish and unwise wouldn't know they shall know their God Amen and now how they shall know their God he's got a direct quote from Daniel he said how he said they shall know their God he shall appear in the last days now these people don't even believe in the appearing but he said he shall appear in the last days to bring him the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband he will know her mate the revealed word the revealed word is the mate of the church amen it's the match experience it's the grace of God that's why this has to happen of course when the word is made flesh then it is the light of the age now if you if you like to look in scripture the Bible is is beautiful in the Book of Daniel the 12th chapter brother B will tie together Daniel 12 and Daniel 11:32 and he'll type them as just one as one time generally he'll say them together like they're the same scripture but they're separate scriptures now in Daniel chapter 12 he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed and sealed up until the time of the end now it's a time period of when Daniel is going to predict the wise shall know their God now it's a time period of the end now watch's the next verse many shall be purified and made wide and tried but the wicked shall do do wickedly the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand amen you you you see the wise shall understand now y'all I read this here to you hear while back in revelation 22 remember the angel that came to John in the in Revelation chapter 10 it said seal the seal it until the seventh angel but in revelation 22 it speaks and he said it's the time to unseal the book John remember and he said the wicked shall go on and be Wicked but the righteous shall be righteous Now read this the wicked's going to go on and be Wicked but the wicked amen they're going to do their works and will not understand but the wise shall understand the wise shall understand the righteous the wise shall understand the spirit of understanding has come upon them they know how the message pulls in the experience of the word and they understand that they understand that it takes an experience with God and a leadership in the word amen they understand the wise shall understand now watch because see the Bible said the people shall know their God now think of this because in Daniel chapter 12 again the Bible is speaking of end time and here um here in the verses of Daniel 12 you'll find Daniel asking the Lord about the end time and remember a man in White shows up on the water and I'm not taking time here because I went through this a month ago amen but when Daniel is asking about the end time he sees a vision of a man standing in white who's upon the river and then there's a man on the left and right brother B said who is the man in white on the water he said that's the Holy Ghost on the people in the end time watch the people shall know their God and do exploits the Holy Ghost shall be on the people they shall know their God and do exploits see the Holy Ghost is supposed to come on the people that's how they're going to do the exploits the Holy Ghost has got to come on you he said for I am the vine and ye are the branches and without me without the holy ghost coming on the people they will do nothing look at what he's saying he's saying that the the understanding would come to the church now here in uh beginning and ending of the dispensation brother R said what is the mystery of God it's the hope of glory shining forth this the baptism of the Holy Spirit now when these things take place time will be no more they that know their God he's going directly they that know their God in the last days many run to and fro but they know their God shall do exploits they shall do exploits exploits of Faith breaking around the world tonight over and over in all the nations in great campaigns blind or seeing deaf or hearing lames walking people of all works of Life are coming in and receiving the Holy Ghost not only the poor and the PO ER but the millionaire in everything God is taking and putting on this robe on each of them and giving them an invitation to the wedding supper again beginning and ending of dispensation morning Stars shouted for Joy the morning Stars shouted The Shining ones that shouted for Joy when they seen that someday the Tabernacle here on Earth and king mecdc would come into righteousness of God gave his life to redeem us back to God again and outshine the Stars forever job where were you before the foundations of the world when the sons of God shouted for Joy now here brother bandham takes that shouting for joy and ties it to Daniel the 12th chapter for the righteous shall shine as the stars of the heaven amen he's showing you this shout religion is God's religion this is not a new religion brother they they were shouting in the church and they said brother Brandon what's this new religion he said this ain't a new religion this is the oldest religion there is in the Book of Job it said job where were you when the sons of God were shouting for Joy when the morning Stars sang together and the sun shouted for Joy I tell you you talking about a new song brother amen you you see that you were them morning stars and the sons of God shouting amen this Bible is not talking about just a general reference it was talking about your Worship in this generation them that know their God shall shine as the stars of their Heavens my they'll be there holding their place come on Church come in no matter what comes no matter what trial strike the church you can depend on the morning Stars they'll be shining and shouting and rejoicing the darkness is upon the Earth gross Darkness on the people but the light is shining upon the Church of the Living God my she's shining forth my we could say it this morning we could Twinkle Twinkle Little Star go ahead and shine tell the world what you are go ahead and break out and let the worship of God come off of your life that people will have to identify you if you if you read that abstract that that's talking about a different people a different time amen I want to assure you that was this time and you are the people I've got a couple quotes here that really nails that down in Christ The Mystery of course brother Ram talks about this is what's been revealed Amen in Revelation book of symbols brother Ram will take the Book of Revelations and he'll say this the mystery of God he says see what's happened he says the people has not been taught the mystery of God the book of uh uh of symbols and Revelations tells us that the Book of Revelations is for this time right now people will take and teach the word by letter again the letter kills but the spirit gives life now watch this he said the mystery of God they've not been taught the mystery of God people think they're teaching Mysteries and they surely are it's a mystery to me how they can take brother man made clear and Mumble it up till nobody can understand it it's a mystery you got to be a smart man to take something simple and make it so complex nobody can understand it amen do you see what he's saying the mystery of God they've not been taught the mystery of God they've been taught to join a church they've been been taught to put their name to be a good fellow to treat their neighbor right that's all right you must know the mystery of God and no man can reveal it to you except the one that has the book what is the mystery of God brother BR said what is the mystery of God it's God in you the hope of glory shining forth the baptism of the holy spirit amen to be taught the mystery of God is to be taught the holy ghost in the life of an individual Daniel saw this in Daniel the 12th chapter I'm from Revelation book of symbols it I don't have time to read through it but if you got time it's powerful amen look what he says Daniel was told by an Angel he heard seven Thunders now how did Brother bandam know that Daniel heard seven Thunders Heen when Daniel sealed it up but inspiration was showing that Daniel and John was seeing the same thing from Daniel 12 to Revelations 10 compare it sometimes beautiful reading he began to get his pen amen and just in about five minutes listen don't write it John saw the same thing and it had already been written outside the Bible he seen the seals on the back of the book and no money could touch those seals and them voices here it is in the Bible which is a mystery itself but on the back side of the Bible was the Revelation Noe to Daniel there's the seven voices uttered no man could open no man knowed what it was but the Bible said in Daniel's Daniel and also to John that in the last days that seven voices would be known by the real true church you get it can you see where the false and the counterfeit is trying their best to keep great men from places like that isn't that something trying to keep great men from these places the places of revelation of the spirit what God reveals look here in the book of Ephesians the church age brother Ram said Daniel heard those Thunders and was forbidden John heard the voices and this book was sealed and on the back of the book was sealed with Seven Seals but in the days these seals was to be open the mystery of God would be finished in other words God would be known to his church not three people but one person the mystery of God would be revealed completely revealed the seven Mysteries would open to the church the church would be living under the inspiration of the holy spirit amen isn't it beautiful that when the seals open what did they reveal they didn't reveal the church they revealed Christ he took the church ages and revealed the church feminine he took the seals and opened the seals masculine do you see what was it was Christ and the church and a prophet was standing in between the two to bring them together to bring the church and God together how can you do it without the Holy Ghost how can you weld the church together with the word without the Holy Ghost otherwise you put the word on you and it'll fall off the first tribulation the first trou the first issue it'll fall off of you but let the Holy Ghost put that word in you one time and brother he'll seal word in you and the devil can't get it out and problems can't get it out churches can't get it out because it's an experience in you oh that's what he was saying the Bride In Christ have become the self-same person come on Church you're a part of this when the people begin to know God unfold God down and see where you find him today unfold him out of the heavens and see where the last unfolding has happened amen deity is not an in heaven this morning deity is in you brother man said don't let them give you a cold Tater and tell you to stand in the corner and wait he said we are now the sons of God we are right now the sons of God we're not going to be in some future State we are now the sons of God and we know our God we know who he is we know who we are we know what we're doing here I'm quoting a prophet to you church amen she now has the revelation that will gather her for the Rapture remember the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word my amen God put a flesh he unfolded this now watch in the message of the guide he said the Holy Spirit speaks the word I got many things to say but cannot understand it now you cannot understand it now the days of the Apostles everybody want to go to the days of the Apostles but in those days Jesus said I got something to say that you can't understand but when the spirit of understanding comes when these books come open he said there's a reason for the coming of them seals he said I'll guide you to it I'm going to say some things to the end time and the Holy Spirit will guide you to what he spoke have you ever read the messages and you're sitting there reading through the sermons and something just guides you into one part and guide you into the next these preachers know what I'm talking about it's like he picks you up and Carries you through the spoken words of God until you gather up enough that your faith turns into a place of invincibility I know where I'm standing on this subject I understand what I'm talking about I'm not just putting words out here no denomination Tod it's no you see what it is it's an experience with a God my he'll guide you to it that's the reason of these coming seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God would be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time it was a mystery you can go to the scripture is powerful Paul says it in the book of Timothy he said great is the mystery of godliness for great is the mystery without argument great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh we handled him seen him received him up into Glory witnessed By Angels Vindicated on the earth God sure it was a great mystery but it's all solved but it's all solved oh Lord I'm know I'm going to probably put some of our message professors out of business this morning it's already solved brother we don't need somebody to come along and solve these things out it's already solved just say what the prophet said just say what the message had to say and the power of God can back up the ministry in the last day we don't amen I tell you I have to be honest with you the reason we don't have to pump up and make a motion and preach a motion brother M fan told me the other day in his meetings of course they got a little emotional he said brother Wayne he said you're an emotional preacher he said but I you never preach emotion I said the reason I Don't Preach emotion is because I don't have to preach emotion if you'll preach the message of the hour the God of this Bible will back up his own word and this is a message of authority it's a message of anointing listen to me this is a lifechanging message you can't actually look at what this message mean and remain the same person it will forever change you it will anoint your life it will change your experience it will put something in you I know it's a controversy that it's a great mystery but it's solved it's solved the mystery solved you don't have to be an algebra scholar to understand this you don't have to be three degrees in school to understand this it will take the simple to less let the revelation of God come into them I don't have anything to present I don't have any idea to compete with I never come through any school I never preached any denomination I just want to say what the message had to say so it's congregation appreciation time and I thank God for a group of people that's okay with just what the messenger had to say I thank God for a group of people that has had enough of Dr so and so and Professor so and so and teacher so and so and ideal so and so I'm glad that there's a people said just give me the word I don't need society and publicity and popularity and politics what I need is the power of the Holy Ghost with anointing and with truth we don't need a robed choir are you hearing me we don't need a thousand better musicians we need the anointing of the word of God in authority and power burning out every heart burning out every life until the Praises of God drops into the church brother man said what's the matter with the church he said we took the fire amen off of The Altar and put it in the furnace but what we needs a fire of God we need something to burn within the heart and the life of the people not a fire that goes out the first time somebody gets a little sideways but a fire that'll burn through every situation and every problem well I feel a preacher coming on this morning I'm sorry but I believe we need it I need we need old fashioned Holy Ghost pillar fire experience with God's [Applause] word it'll make the message more important to you afraid some people don't know what that Pillar of Fire is he solved this out he solved it out to bring strength to you it's what he's doing he's bringing God did that to bring strength if you w sure where you're at then you're going to be vamboo where's Ashton did I get that right I was wanting to say lament one time and I said laminated he said brother Wayne I'm not sure how we're going to laminate the people but one thing about it my vocabulary give us a laugh every time so what it is you got to get under inspiration because new words come to me you know made it spiritual didn't I I don't I'm not sure it's what it meant but we can use it they'll speak a new language Abraham's Covenant confirmed by the way speaking of covenants God bless you brother Isaac that was a powerful word that was a powerful word hey this is what the message produces men of God standing with this message amen I certainly enjoyed that amen do you see what it is it's the it's the red body raised up on the Easter morning set him at the right hand of the throne but the spirit that was in him was sent down to the church so when the church covenant is brought into full strength now look at this God took his body that was God's part of the C Covenant was the body of Jesus he has it the our part of the Covenant that he give us our receipt of the Covenant is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said so when that is brought into full effect so then the holy ghost in the age of Pentecost wasn't in full effect it was only under a shook see it was the Holy Ghost but it wasn't in full effect it hadn't done everything it was supposed to do it hadn't guided to the open of the seals it hadn't brought the church to the fullness of adoption the Holy Ghost is supposed to do them things but it wasn't Under full effect but when the Covenant is confirmed with God the church the people that goes into that body here as a bride will be exactly the same spirit that was upon Christ doing the same things the same Ministry with the same power now them people that know their God we on that is the same period of time when Abraham's Covenant comes into full effect so it's not doing away with the Holy Ghost it's the full effect of the Holy Ghost you mean it didn't just stop with a portion of it it brought you into the weed age look what he says in see not AB the Shu he says he talks about brother Luther moved to justification he said well it's moved to sanctification he said but then watch those Pentecostals come along he said but watch now but now it's coming to say I and my father are one and these other things these Shucks begin to pull away and their genuine bride in the church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength this church will bring forth the word in its fullness and in his strength I'm reading about you now amen see not every the sh brother R said the elected church somewhere in this world that's pulling out and set aside from these things the Manifest God manifestation of God has attracted it we're at the last day the Shu has G forth its strength into the seed it's went on out it was a good shuck but it served its term it is the word Bride of the word groom see the shuck served its term now the life that was in the shock was put into the seed life so we ain't lost anything but what was only able to produce a Shu in Pentecost has come to produce an entire wheat in this age we're not put anything off we're putting on Perfection they knew him but not imperfection oh God they knew him they knew him in certain ways but not in Perfection but there's coming a bride that will know him in perfection in other words she will have seen a full revelation of him and who else will a man fully reveal himself to but his own wife do you see it comes into Perfection amen this this this coming forth this this husk that give its life to the seed it was the strength of it is what was given to you the strength now if you go to Psalms 28 David says this he said the Lord is my strength so the Lord left that shuck and come right into the seed now they're left with forms and traditions and ideas but the Lord left it the Lord's not with it anymore but the Lord is with his word which is in Perfection watch David said the Lord is my strength and my shield in the eth verse he said the Lord is their strength and he is saving strength of his anointed look in Psalms 27 And1 David said for the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear for the Lord is the strength of my life and of whom shall I be afraid raptures right Rapture right the strength for Rapture The Virtue for rapture the Lord is the strength of my rapturing life that that'll change you and Rapture you is the Lord that's the only thing that'll do it is the Lord he is the strength of my life the Lord is my salvation now according to David I'm going to stay with David a minute and David in Psalms 84 and verse 5 he said blessed is the man whose strength is in thee he said brother Wayne why have you transitioned to strength all of a sudden well the Bible in Daniel 11:32 said they know know their God they'll be strong now if I say to you you're going to be strong you're going to say how am I going to get strong what am I going to do to get strong here it's showing the strength coming from the Lord blessed is that man who gets his strength not from his knowledge not from his ability but from the Lord do you see what it is if he gets that from the Lord he says man blesses the man whose strength is in the Lord now think about this then if your strength is in the Lord no matter what you're going through you're always going to be strong because the weakening conditions of lead deia will not be affecting the strength of the Lord the Lord will be just as strong but the Bible even predicts a stronger anointing in this age than the ages that were previous the conditions are worse but if your strength is coming from the Lord the Lord has prophesied a presence in this age by the appearing of the son of man which brings the Church in amen watch blessed is the man whose strength is in thee whose heart and the way of them and David explains it in the next verse and I'm not going to take you to a Biblical lesson today on this point but I think it's a good point blessed is a man whose strength is in thee who passing through the valley of baka make it as a whale the rain also filth the pools now there's a huge argument brother BR didn't touch it so I don't have any Authority at all on it but I'll say this there's a huge argument about what that Baka means some says it's a Valley of Tears some says it means a mberry bush some it there's a there's a huge H huge argument over the Hebrew of what Baka actually means which is exactly what brother Randon was saying he said see how can you get a Revival off of Just translations when the people who are doing the translations don't agree so there's got to come a revelation of what it is you see now watch because the Baka here it will be made as a well the rain also fth the P so blessed is a man whose strength comes from the Lord even passing through the valley of baka many people actually agree in the in the and the writers actually put this out mostly that it's actually not a place in Israel at all but it's actually a picturesque thing that deals with conditions of life in other words dry seasons of life now think about this a man whose strength is coming from the Lord when he's passing through the deserts of life when he's passing through the Wilderness amen you see what he's saying he's saying here that even then there his will filth the pools amen though thou wst in the dry places there's still water there though you walk through the most desperate times of your life there's still Joy there because your strength is not coming from the circumstance it's coming from the Lord hey I think we ought to put on our joy shoes this morning and remember where our strength is coming from we're not strong because someone approves of us we're not strong because somebody a certain group likes us or don't like us our strength is because we have an experience with the almighty God and he's a strength Giver in the hour when a man needs strength amen now I'm going to talk about you a minute in verse seven it says they go from strength to strength a man who gets his strength from the Lord goes from strength to strength and everyone that appear before them in Zion I love how the the Amplified Bible has this point it says they go from strength to strength increasing in in Victor Victorious power increasing in Victorious power we're not walking from strength to weakness we're not going backwards Church we're not going to become a weaker people as the Nations get weaker as troubles get greater actually it's predicted of you if your strength is coming from the Lord you're going to go from strong to Stronger amen from strength to strength you're going to increase in strength now you might not even understand the strength increase if your life but if you amen you you got to see that God's given you Grace remember that he said amen Paul said take this trial away he said my grace is sufficient remember that my grace is sufficient and my strength is made perfect in your weakness amen so humanly weaker amen but greater in the strength of God in other words look you're you're not existing as a Christian Amen in the in the easy times you're not existing as a Christian when the Great revivals of the 40s and 50s were were clipping off and everybody was believing what you're believing you have remained with your integrity upon the word of God in an hour when you can't hardly find a clean heart nowhere it's the days of Noah again but you got a strength within you that makes you walk this way it makes you talk this way so brother Wayne what are you saying I'm saying if you're still existing right now it's only because your strength has increased because the age has got worse and you're still here so without an increase of strength you would have fell off a long time ago God ain't left you just walking with the same thing you had 10 years ago if you're alive this morning you are stronger than you were 10 years ago well from strength to strength they're going to walk it from strength to strength they're going to get stronger now that's what David had to say he said you will increase in Victorious strength so if you're on your way home and there's a there's a obstacle between you and home then just move it you're walking you're walking that way just move it you have strength to move it now when David preaches this and David says this I thought I think of David I think of the writer I can't help it but the writer means something to me when David writes this when strength to strength and I think who was David actually writing about what kind of examples would David have to write this kind of text they'll walk through through the valley of baka they go strength to strength blessed is the man who's Lord and I'm thinking now who was David's forefathers amen now y'all know there's one that just sticks right out in your mind one who followed the Lord in the Bible there was a man named Caleb remember David knew about Caleb's life all of Israel knew about Caleb's life Caleb's life was so important that it found its way in the Book of Numbers whenever that 12 Spies were sent over into the land and they were to spy out the land it was a land of promise remember and they went over and there were 12 Spies went over and looked into the land amen and when they come back the scripture tells us amen that 10 of the spies seen Giants they acknowledged milk and honey but they only sing the Giants of the land and comparably to themselves they were getting their own strength from themselves comparably they became grasshoppers in the sights of those giants remember those 10 they did but there were two of them Joshua and Caleb on the other hand that had seen the same Giants experienced the same problems but when they come back they brought evidences of an unseen land to an expected people those evidences were milk and honey oh my Amen in the land of milk and honey they brought evidences of grapes and milk and honey what were they doing they were bringing evidences exploits of another land they were bringing those evidences where people could literally taste they could taste of the other land though they had not been there though they had not been in those places now the others can only talk about the Giants that they had visited in those places but somebody had their mind on the evidences of that place oh church amen you know brother Ram said it he said there's a land of Divine Healing he said and when you go over in that land God will send Witnesses into that land he said but somebody will know somebody amen who didn't get healed and all the thing they can come back with as a testimony as they believed and didn't get healed he said there's that giant that you will face every time you go to testifying about your healing amen there's Giants I I I tell you I I want to preach a sermon almost titled it milk honey and Giants amen amen you see what it is they're all there but where's your focus amen what you going to focus on the Giants the problems the failures the situations let me tell you if you're looking for something to discourage you you've come to the right place because every time the sons of God come together the devil come also and brother bam said if you you expect to find something wrong the devil will make sure you find it that's right he said but if you've come expecting something from God he said God will get you your expectation so I want to know who's going to meet your expectation today are you going to have fellowship with God if you do you'll leave here strong and you'll have exploits in your life if you let the devil get a hold of you you'll start looking at the negative and you don't have to ask when a man's looking at the negative cuz everything's disappointing they go to the edge of Life they're troubled by everything they can't Fellowship hardly anymore they things they used to build up now they tear down a depressive negative Spirit begins to move around them why is it they got their eyes on the wrong thing and the devil is working overtime to get your eyes off of the things of God because there is where your strength is it's when you focus on the word come on church either your problems will swallow you or you'll swallow your problems either either either discouragement will take your Victory or your Victory will swallow the discouragement and rise up out of it and let the grace of God come upon your life well I don't know about you but I'm not going to let no negative depressing disgusting devil take the joy out of my heart that God has so violently put in me I'm going to dance when I don't feel like dancing I'm going to shout when I don't feel like shouting cuz I'm going to tell that devil I got mil and honey devil oh if you think I'm a little crazy I got quotes backing up what I'm talking about he said preacher what are you what are you saying I tell you what brother Ram said he said they were the evidences of that land and when they begin to Feast on them evidences amen look what it done it brought courage and Caleb had courage he stealed the people he had another Spirit yall know what another spirit means it means a following Spirit that's just the Hebrew another another spirit is a following Spirit and the Bible said he holy followed the Lord amen and when brother random comes along he prophesies and said the end time will receive a Joshua and Caleb anointing Joshua will represent the end time messenger and Caleb will represent them who have followed this message oh I tell you we got a houseful of calebs this morning I'm actually thinking about one Caleb Among Us right now amen who holy followed the message of the Hour come on he focused on that milk and honey and waited 45 years to get the mountain that God had promised him he could have y'all don't think I'm crazy let me tell you what a brother Bram said about it just so you so you don't think I'm a Nut brother Bram said that milk and honey would have made a good Pentecostal cocktail in Exodus he said it would make a Pentecostal cocktail y'all know what a cocktail is it's when they mix up a drink that influences you and changes the way you act amen if you ever knew whiskey you know it's strong and it'll make you act a certain way well if you ever knew a Pentecostal cocktail of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in power and you would know if you drinking it's strong strong drink brother amen it's new wine it's got power and proof and it'll change your actions it'll change the way you feel it will give you Joy in the midst of tribulations come on church I think we need to make some cocktails this morning and just pass them out people come to church with their their faces is wrong and troubles every words I know there's trouble but there's people that shouting right now that's got more trouble than you got but the strength is coming from the Lord we're still standing and the devil has come against us but the power of God is still bringing righteous and truth that's right GL shout that devil out of here praise God until the power of the Holy Ghost changes you I think we need to get the church drunk again until they quit caring about all the problems and all the [Applause] [Music] situations go ahead and drink it with us devil if you can't take it I'll tell you this there is evidences of another land among us brother Wayne I don't think you are to encourage the people to drink well brother random said they what they need is to get drunk I'm not just proposing that you drink I'm proposing you get drunk I'm saying drink till you can't drive I'm saying drink till you lose who you are and what you think about brother brand said we ought to get so drunk that we forget our own name come on Church one thing about a drunk is he don't remember tomorrow what he did and it's time to start forgetting a few things it's start time to start forgetting some of the problems that have collected through the years of True Word Tabernacle why not just take a flesh start this morning and let the same Vigor of the baptism of the Holy Ghost come into you with life get drunk on the anointing get drunk and forget it forget about who's who and who's going to be who and what's going to be what amen let's just love God and drink ourselves into a [Music] place so preacher you shouldn't be you shouldn't be proposing these things well brother Ram said we should get drunk and he said the stimulation of Revelation should have the same effect on the church as a natural wine has and natural wine don't care what color you are it don't care what race you are amen people say well brother way that's just not our nature and it wasn't nobody's nature till they got to drinking wine but it changed their nature it affected the most unaffected because glory to God it'll put a smile on your face it's in full effect now come on the Revelation is in full effect brother Wayne I can't believe you that mean can I can I just continue for a moment I I stay right in the word is all right I'll stay right in the word direction of the word brother BR said what we need is to get drunk he said why do we need to get drunk brother brand said well the other day Salvation Army went and picked the drunk out of the street it was below freezing he was out there without a coat passed out in the street somebody picked him up and took him into salvation they said are you going to take him to hospital he said no need to go they said well I thought he might have H hypothermia he said the Salvation Army said the man Ain got hypothermia he said his blood alcohol content is so high he said that his veins are running with alcohol he said you couldn't freeze him to death if you wanted to he said I think the church then are to get so full of the Holy Ghost Power and so drunk on the word of God that you can't cool them off Leia can't cool her off travels can't cool her off she got drunk on the Revelation strong [Music] Wine Pass the bottle brother brother Wayne I don't like it when you preach on wine listen that's milk and honey to me that's milk and honey that's where it those it comes out of that other land grapes from Canaan they brought back evidences of another land and Caleb was so influenced by what he saw that he stood against everything around him and said there is a land and we are more than able to take it he couldn't change his Direction brother he could face the Giants of anac at 85 years old you couldn't change that man's Direction he said that's the mountain that Moses gave me you know he had to wait 40 years on on that but R he was ready for it the day Moses gave it to him but he had to wait 40 years to get a new generation that was ready to go over in that land and 40 years later amen look what happened Caleb goes over in that land and he gets Joshua to the side he said Moses said I could have it where was his title to the mountain Moses said where was his claim to the mountain Moses said now where's your claim to these things Moses said brother randam said it sometimes people don't even like to take what brother randam said but to me it's my ground to me it's my stand it's where I can stand and know that every devil has got to back up if we're standing on thus sayith the Lord strength and the Holy Ghost fill anointing look what he done he come over there brother Nathan he said to him he said look he said Moses told me 4 and5 years ago so he's 85 right 40 and 5 years ago that I could take that L and I'm as strong now as I was the day that the promise was given come on Church you know he was just as strong he was ready to take his sword and fight those anxs until he took that land and I say this morning amen there's some Believers Among Us that's feeling their age these days but they're just as strong in this message
