[15:59] testimony from sister gayle says some of
[16:01] you know my son michael's story he was
[16:03] not born into his now physical condition
[16:05] but it was from a surgery that went
[16:06] terribly wrong the lord brought him back
[16:09] but he had suffered brain damage from
[16:11] lack of oxygen for so long what
[16:13] michael's life may have may had been
[16:15] taken away from him at that moment
[16:18] i was not serving the lord at this time
[16:20] but our lord and savior use michael's
[16:21] circumstance to bring me and eventually
[16:23] my children to him praise god all of us
[16:25] at that moment were given a new life
[16:26] amen i have had murdered have heard many
[16:29] times the encounter with a young man
[16:30] with a chain around his neck and being
[16:32] in an animal-like condition that brother
[16:34] josh bennett brought out on thursday
[16:36] night no doubt many people would look
[16:38] upon him and feel that there's no real
[16:40] humanness to him let alone feeling love
[16:42] and compassion for another but the lord
[16:45] jesus allowed our prophet to see into
[16:46] that man's heart and discounting all
[16:49] satan had done physically to him satan
[16:51] couldn't have his heart a heart that was
[16:53] capable of love and compassion
[16:55] not even of himself but for his brother
[16:58] amen praise god my heart was so full
[17:00] thinking about my own son and his heart
[17:02] we got home and i set michael up in his
[17:04] room
[17:05] he has a lazy boy chair a laptop which
[17:08] he watches and listens to services
[17:10] messages and singing about our savior
[17:13] and there are pictures of family sitting
[17:15] on the side i was looking at michael
[17:16] sitting there and i asked him michael
[17:19] what is in your heart
[17:20] [Music]
[17:22] he looked at me and smiled and held up
[17:24] two fingers i said you have two things
[17:27] in your heart he shook his head yes
[17:29] i said what is one thing in your heart
[17:31] and very directly he pointed to the
[17:33] laptop where he hears nothing except
[17:35] jesus
[17:36] i said jesus is in your heart and he
[17:38] shook his head yes yes i asked him what
[17:41] the second thing in his heart and again
[17:42] very directly he pointed to our family
[17:44] picture
[17:45] i said your i asked your family is in
[17:47] your heart shaking his head and smiling
[17:50] yes i was so full of love and compassion
[17:52] believing this conversation was from the
[17:54] lord
[17:55] satan may try to rob us here but oh are
[17:57] treasures that are waiting for us
[17:59] whether here or there michael has a new
[18:01] body waiting for him
[18:04] hallelujah
[18:05] [Applause]
[18:08] [Music]
[18:14] satan
[18:16] michael has a new body waiting for him
[18:18] then we will talk as long as we want
[18:20] enjoying our voices and many missed and
[18:22] new conversations i pray the lord
[18:24] blesses you and all who remember
[18:26] remember michael in your prayers god
[18:28] bless
[18:29] p.s michael's two favorite ministers our
[18:31] brother josh ben and brother donnie
[18:33] reagan michael has probably listened to
[18:35] the message
[18:36] is there any sons a hundred times still
[18:38] blesses him amen praise the name of the
[18:40] lord we thank god
[18:42] we love our brother michael
[18:45] amen

[50:49] wedding ceremony again i think it's
[50:51] probably one of the best ceremonies i'd
[50:53] ever heard spoken personally
[50:55] but there's a lot of personal things
[50:57] that's went on in the family and
[50:59] brother ron has been such an
[51:01] encouragement to our family and
[51:03] especially to bethany herself and so you
[51:06] could you could hear that uh that
[51:08] there's been an influence there and we
[51:10] just thank the lord for the ministry and
[51:12] what we what we'd like to do this
[51:14] morning if we could just maybe uh turn
[51:16] the order of the service and let's just
[51:18] sing that little song this morning
[51:20] that he is here amen he is here and
[51:24] you know when jesus comes
[51:27] he makes all the difference
[51:29] we just just had a tremendous camp
[51:32] meeting
[51:33] and i know all of us was happy with it
[51:35] and we all said my that was a good
[51:37] meeting and we're happy
[51:39] but you know
[51:40] when jesus came by
[51:43] and he sanctioned with his presence
[51:46] that's the one we want to be happy
[51:48] and we want him to be happy with this
[51:50] gathering this morning
[51:51] i know there's mothers sitting here with
[51:53] needs
[51:54] i know there's fathers that are trying
[51:56] to make decisions and they
[51:58] struggling there's there's elders that
[52:00] are watching people they're been praying
[52:02] for for years and they want to see them
[52:04] forward moving me and you know
[52:07] in bible times when jesus was about to
[52:10] pass through
[52:11] the people would gather out in the
[52:13] streets and they would lay the lame in
[52:14] the halt
[52:16] and they would just pray that the lord
[52:18] might look their way
[52:20] and if he looked their way everything
[52:21] was about to change
[52:23] so this morning as jesus passed by
[52:26] as he passes through this room this
[52:28] morning why don't you
[52:29] with your hearts just begin to pull on
[52:31] him said lord

[55:50] we don't have to ask for any more today
[55:52] but we have need of them but
[55:54] today is a miracle for me
[55:57] in some respects i never thought i would

[56:01] but god's great
[56:03] he's absolutely a sustainer
[56:06] sure miss brother ray this morning and i
[56:08] pray that god touches his body and
[56:10] raises him up

[56:38] we are certainly
[56:39] thrilled this week to celebrate another
[56:41] birthday
[56:42] and
[56:44] and so we're just thrilled about that
[56:46] and uh probably for most part i wouldn't

[1:01:42] now satan you take your hands off of him
[1:01:44] in the name of jesus christ
[1:01:47] because our father is not done with him
[1:01:49] yet
[1:01:51] many more powerful sermons to come
[1:01:55] my buddy brother tim pruitt that's
[1:01:57] watching just now
[1:01:59] you're a healer of back conditions
[1:02:04] and lord i just ask you that you would
[1:02:06] touch him
[1:02:08] do a work father
[1:02:10] lord the many needs that are around us
[1:02:12] that even cause fear
[1:02:15] father you're with us in a storm
[1:02:19] father i i've been through a year and a
[1:02:21] half of a storm
[1:02:23] and there's been waves that seem like
[1:02:25] 150 foot high over top of me
[1:02:28] and say pass through
[1:02:31] lord
[1:02:32] you just took me by the hand
[1:02:36] and guided us through every situation
[1:02:39] i ask you today that you would anoint us
[1:02:41] give us strength to speak
[1:02:43] anoint our hearts
[1:02:45] and if there's any gift that we have let
[1:02:47] us get ourselves out of the way
[1:02:50] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:02:52] amen and amen and amen
[1:02:55] amen god bless you thank you for being
[1:02:57] such a wonderful audience
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:01] if you will turn with you into matthew
[1:03:03] chapter 6 and verse 9.
[1:03:10] this is very familiar portion of
[1:03:12] scripture
[1:03:13] and then we'll go to psalms chapter 46.
[1:03:27] jesus teaches us how to pray and so one
[1:03:30] of the greatest answers that we can have
[1:03:32] in life and the greatest connections
[1:03:34] is that we can talk to god
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:38] and tell him very sincerely our deepest
[1:03:41] desires
[1:03:42] and we can do it in the privacy
[1:03:45] of our own lives
[1:03:48] and it doesn't go through a bishop
[1:03:51] or a cardinal yeah or a pope
[1:03:55] or even brother branham
[1:03:58] it goes directly into the hands of our
[1:04:01] god
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] and the good news is he hears every
[1:04:06] prayer
[1:04:09] and he answers
[1:04:10] every one of them
[1:04:13] he answers every one of them
[1:04:16] and so the disciples that was the inner
[1:04:18] circle of believers
[1:04:21] knew that this was the communication
[1:04:23] with god and they had seen jesus go away
[1:04:26] to pray and draw strength
[1:04:29] they needed that because
[1:04:31] jesus would not always be with them
[1:04:34] in a fleshly form
[1:04:37] and they needed to have some key
[1:04:39] thoughts of how do we talk to god
[1:04:43] it still works today
[1:04:49] after this manner
[1:04:50] therefore pray ye
[1:04:52] our father which art in heaven
[1:04:55] hallowed be thy name
[1:04:58] thy kingdom come
[1:05:00] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:05:02] heaven
[1:05:04] give us this day our daily bread and
[1:05:06] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[1:05:09] debtors
[1:05:10] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:05:13] deliver us from evil
[1:05:15] for thine is the kingdom
[1:05:17] and the power and the glory
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:27] psalms chapter 46 and verse 1.
[1:05:34] god is our refuge
[1:05:36] and strength
[1:05:39] and that's what i want to speak on
[1:05:41] our refuge and strength
[1:05:44] a very present help in the time of
[1:05:46] trouble
[1:05:48] in trouble
[1:05:49] therefore will not we fear
[1:05:52] though the earth be removed
[1:05:55] and though the mountains be carried into
[1:05:58] the midst of the sea
[1:05:59] though the waters thereof roar and be
[1:06:02] troubled though the mountains shake with
[1:06:04] the swelling thereof salah
[1:06:07] there is a river the streams whereof
[1:06:10] shall make the the city of god the holy
[1:06:14] place of the tabernacles of the most
[1:06:16] high god is in the midst of her
[1:06:19] and she shall not be moved
[1:06:22] god shall help her
[1:06:24] and that right early the heathen rage
[1:06:27] the kingdoms were moved
[1:06:29] he utterly he uttered his voice and the
[1:06:32] earth melted
[1:06:34] the lord of hosts is with us
[1:06:36] the god of jacob is our refuge
[1:06:40] come behold the works of the lord and
[1:06:42] what desolations he hath made in the
[1:06:44] earth
[1:06:45] he maketh wars to cease unto the end of
[1:06:48] the earth
[1:06:49] he breaketh the bow and he cut off the
[1:06:51] spear and asunder he burneth the chariot
[1:06:54] in the fire
[1:06:56] be still
[1:06:57] and know that i am god i will be exalted
[1:07:01] among the heathen i will be exalted in
[1:07:04] the earth
[1:07:05] the lord of hosts is with us
[1:07:09] the god of jacob is our refuge
[1:07:13] let's read that last verse together the
[1:07:15] lord of hosts is with us the god of
[1:07:19] jacob is a refuge
[1:07:21] you may be seated
[1:07:27] hallelujah

[1:07:47] should last do it again and so i
[1:07:48] encourage you to do it again

[1:07:54] shouted too much but
[1:07:56] hey we are just getting ready to shout
[1:07:58] on the streets of gold
[1:08:08] hallelujah
[1:08:10] brother branham said that he
[1:08:13] he took jesus upon a mountain and set
[1:08:15] him down and
[1:08:17] and jesus rebuked rebuked him again with
[1:08:20] the word
[1:08:21] he defeated satan with the word of god
[1:08:26] showing that the weakest of christians
[1:08:30] has the devil whispered in your ear this
[1:08:32] week
[1:08:33] the weakest of christians can defeat
[1:08:36] satan with thus saith the lord
[1:08:39] it is written
[1:08:42] it is written
[1:08:44] it is written
[1:08:47] psalms 23 says it like this and we knew
[1:08:49] it since a little child the lord is my
[1:08:52] shepherd
[1:08:53] so let's just lay some real foundations
[1:08:55] down the lord is my shepherd and i shall
[1:08:58] not want

[1:09:58] thou preparest a table before me in the
[1:10:01] presence of my minimus
[1:10:06] how that must shake the kingdom of hell
[1:10:10] christians don't run
[1:10:17] hallelujah we don't run
[1:10:23] glory lord
[1:10:25] thou anoint my head with all in my cup
[1:10:27] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:10:30] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:10:33] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:10:34] lord
[1:10:36] forever
[1:10:39] i'm not quitting church i'm not going
[1:10:41] back
[1:10:42] i won't quit worshiping the lord
[1:10:45] regardless of my trial regardless of my
[1:10:48] situation
[1:10:51] i have been built for this hour
[1:10:55] this is why i was born
[1:10:58] this is why he prepared me and built me
[1:11:01] like he built me
[1:11:04] god will have a testimony on the earth
[1:11:12] i'd like to declare this this this
[1:11:14] morning
[1:11:15] jesus
[1:11:17] is on his way
[1:11:20] and there's nothing that the satan can
[1:11:22] do to stop him
[1:11:31] and we say amen
[1:11:35] psalms 27 says it like this the lord is
[1:11:38] my light and my salvation
[1:11:41] whom shall i fear
[1:11:43] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:11:45] of whom shall i be afraid
[1:11:49] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:11:51] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:11:53] they stumbled and fell
[1:11:55] though a host should encamp against me
[1:11:58] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:12:01] rise against me in this will i be
[1:12:03] confident one thing that i have desired
[1:12:05] of the lord that that that of the lord
[1:12:08] all the days of my life to behold the
[1:12:10] beauty of the lord and inquire in his
[1:12:12] temple for in the time of trouble
[1:12:17] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:12:21] the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:12:23] hide me and he shall set me up on a rock
[1:12:26] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:12:29] my enemies round about me therefore
[1:12:31] while i offer in his tabernacle
[1:12:33] sacrifices of joy i will sing
[1:12:37] yea i will sing praises unto the lord
[1:12:42] hear o lord when i cry my with my voice
[1:12:45] have mercy upon me and answer me when
[1:12:48] thou i seek ye my face my heart said
[1:12:51] unto thee thy face lord will i seek
[1:12:54] hide not thy face far from me put not
[1:12:57] thy servant away in anger
[1:12:59] david was just describing all of our
[1:13:02] feelings many times in our lives
[1:13:05] thou hast been my help leave me not
[1:13:07] neither forsake me o god of my salvation
[1:13:10] when my father and my mother forsake
[1:13:16] me then the lord will take me up
[1:13:21] teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a
[1:13:24] plain path because of mine enemies
[1:13:27] deliver me not over into the will of
[1:13:28] mine enemies for false witnesses are
[1:13:30] risen up against me
[1:13:32] and such breathe out cruelty i had
[1:13:35] fainted
[1:13:37] you said brother on what you read the
[1:13:39] first part of the scripture and we know
[1:13:40] that that's the text for the rapture
[1:13:44] but did you read the second part of it
[1:13:49] because in the time of trouble we're
[1:13:51] going to go through some things
[1:13:53] and i would have fainted
[1:13:56] unless i had believed to see the
[1:13:58] goodness of the lord in the land of the
[1:14:01] livin
[1:14:03] wait on the lord and be of good courage
[1:14:06] and he shall strengthen thine heart
[1:14:09] wait i say on the lord
[1:14:14] i feel like 10 000 volts of electricity
[1:14:16] is on this stage
[1:14:20] psalms 91
[1:14:22] says he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:14:24] place of the most high shall abide unto
[1:14:26] the shadow of the almighty
[1:14:28] i will say of the lord
[1:14:30] he is my refuge and my fortress
[1:14:40] in him will i trust
[1:14:44] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:14:46] snare of the fowler and the noise of
[1:14:48] pestilence and he shall cover thee with
[1:14:51] his feathers and under his wings thou
[1:14:53] shalt trust
[1:14:54] and he shall be thy shield and buckler
[1:14:57] thou shalt not be afraid of the tear by
[1:15:00] night or the arrow that flies by day
[1:15:02] neither the pestilence
[1:15:04] that walketh in the darkness nor the
[1:15:06] destruction that wastes at the noon day
[1:15:09] a thousand shall fall at thy side and
[1:15:11] ten thousand at thy right hand but it
[1:15:13] shall not come not thee only with thine
[1:15:15] eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[1:15:17] reward of the wicked because now notice
[1:15:20] this are these words because thou hast
[1:15:23] made the lord which is my refuge
[1:15:26] even the most high thy habitation there
[1:15:29] shall no evil befall thee
[1:15:32] neither shall any plague come now thy
[1:15:34] dwelling for he shall give his angels
[1:15:38] charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
[1:15:42] ways
[1:15:48] let me just
[1:15:49] let's just stop just for a moment
[1:15:51] you are the most powerful people on the
[1:15:53] earth
[1:15:58] you are the most powerful people on the
[1:16:00] earth
[1:16:01] in geneva they will gather
[1:16:03] presidents and dictators from all over
[1:16:06] the world
[1:16:07] to the naked eye that looks like the
[1:16:09] most powerful men gathered for this
[1:16:11] moment
[1:16:13] but that's not how god looks at it
[1:16:17] god looks at it when you gather here in
[1:16:19] this room and bring your lips of fire
[1:16:22] from your homes
[1:16:23] and you make a vote
[1:16:26] that god's on my side
[1:16:30] are you with me brother brown called you
[1:16:32] a super race of people
[1:16:37] he said if he set a hit on 16 cylinders
[1:16:40] so will the bride
[1:16:42] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:16:45] of his power
[1:16:47] the very same life that was in jesus
[1:16:49] christ he placed it on the inside of you
[1:16:53] all that god was he poured it into the
[1:16:55] church
[1:16:59] you're the attributes of his mind living
[1:17:05] let me just say this you don't let the
[1:17:07] devil whisper in your ear that you're
[1:17:09] nobody
[1:17:13] you're the most powerful people god the
[1:17:16] infinite god
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:19] didn't pick a weak bride to stand at
[1:17:22] this layout of cnh he picked the
[1:17:24] strongest of the strongest to live here
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:35] when hell would enlarge itself
[1:17:38] lay out a seal would pour all of its
[1:17:40] demons out there would be a bride on the
[1:17:42] earth
[1:17:44] that would have the greatest armor with
[1:17:47] the greatest message
[1:17:49] and would stand still and see the
[1:17:52] salvation of god
[1:17:54] you can't move them you can't shake them
[1:18:00] they're not turning and running
[1:18:04] they know who they are
[1:18:06] they know what they've been called for
[1:18:09] they know that what they've been elected
[1:18:11] for in this age
[1:18:14] this is our hour
[1:18:23] we don't have to apologize for being a
[1:18:25] noisy church
[1:18:28] we'll reflect in heaven
[1:18:39] we're reflecting our inheritance
[1:18:43] i do not have to wait just walk on
[1:18:45] streets of gold to worship the lord
[1:18:49] i don't have to wait to walk and dance
[1:18:52] over there i can do it right here
[1:18:56] regardless of our conditions
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:14] the scripture said who hath believed i
[1:19:16] report
[1:19:18] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:19:19] revealed
[1:19:21] for he shall
[1:19:22] we
[1:19:24] are
[1:19:24] healed
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:32] not going to be
[1:19:34] we are healed
[1:19:42] and the same god that could forgive the
[1:19:44] most wicked person in the city
[1:19:48] and it did not diminish his power
[1:19:51] one little iota
[1:19:55] god don't have to recharge
[1:20:00] it doesn't diminish his power of the
[1:20:02] blood of jesus christ
[1:20:04] when he saves the worst sinner in the
[1:20:06] city
[1:20:08] neither does it diminish his power of
[1:20:11] the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:13] by his stripes we are healed
[1:20:17] you can line up every cancer devil in
[1:20:19] the world they are defeated
[1:20:22] [Applause]
[1:20:36] on the fly leaf of brother branham's
[1:20:37] bible he had the vision that two years
[1:20:39] before that he was going to pray for
[1:20:41] that little dead finland boy there in
[1:20:44] finland
[1:20:47] listen it didn't shock god that it
[1:20:49] happened
[1:20:51] time
[1:20:53] expiring does not shock god
[1:20:57] two years later they come up on the
[1:20:59] scene
[1:21:03] and brother branham is looking at the
[1:21:04] scene and feels something familiar
[1:21:07] asking even is this little boy been seen
[1:21:09] in the prayer line have i seen him in a
[1:21:12] service
[1:21:13] and then it hits him to go
[1:21:15] god speaks to him to go read the fly
[1:21:17] leaf and he looks around and
[1:21:19] everything's exactly just right
[1:21:24] that's why we as ministers can look at
[1:21:26] what's going on now
[1:21:29] and because we've seen it in the vision
[1:21:32] of the message
[1:21:37] you are what the message has produced
[1:21:43] brother branham standing there night
[1:21:45] after night things that are to be works
[1:21:47] as faith express the rapture
[1:21:50] all of those messages which is laying
[1:21:52] out maybe to unbelieving congregations
[1:21:56] but the word was going out knowing that
[1:22:00] you were coming
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:08] he knew that you would arrive
[1:22:10] he knew you would arrive exactly on time
[1:22:19] when god comes to job
[1:22:22] job is a does not know that
[1:22:26] god's had a conversation with his enemy
[1:22:29] the enemy that he made
[1:22:33] always remember that the enemy that
[1:22:36] you're fighting is the enemy god made
[1:22:40] that's an important key
[1:22:46] god built his own enemy
[1:22:49] and he's only a tool in the hand of god
[1:22:55] and one day we'll look at him and go is
[1:22:57] that the man that troubled us
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:04] and remember he's a fallen angel
[1:23:08] and you're a risen one
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:14] and remember this
[1:23:16] brother branham stood there and said
[1:23:18] that you have more authority than an
[1:23:21] angel in heaven
[1:23:23] and let that be very specific
[1:23:26] even in satan's highest order
[1:23:30] being the angel over top of worship
[1:23:34] as a son and daughter of god you still
[1:23:37] had more power than he did
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:43] and definitely because he has fallen and
[1:23:46] he wrestles against you and he fights
[1:23:48] against you because he knows who you are
[1:23:53] when you take the word of god
[1:23:56] when you take the word of god and you
[1:23:59] begin to cut him apart
[1:24:04] listen he may come to your house but you
[1:24:06] don't have to give him a good day
[1:24:16] when he comes to talk to job about
[1:24:20] having to have a visitation with him
[1:24:23] job is sitting on an ash heap
[1:24:25] that's where he had worshiped
[1:24:27] it's a good spot to go where you worship
[1:24:30] regardless of your circumstances
[1:24:32] go where you worship
[1:24:35] now the enemy will tell you to stay home
[1:24:39] have a pity party
[1:24:42] nobody loves you
[1:24:45] but go to where you worship
[1:24:55] now when god comes to me notice in the
[1:24:58] scriptures maybe you're a better reader
[1:25:00] than i am but i don't notice anywhere in
[1:25:02] the scriptures where
[1:25:04] god has a pity party with him
[1:25:08] he doesn't talk about even his
[1:25:10] circumstances
[1:25:14] but he begins to ask him job where was
[1:25:16] you
[1:25:24] when i was molding the earth where was
[1:25:26] you when i was laying the foundations
[1:25:30] where was you
[1:25:33] when the morning stars sing together
[1:25:38] so god not always describing to job
[1:25:42] i saw you before the foundation of the
[1:25:44] world
[1:25:45] and i see you after
[1:25:49] amen
[1:25:51] what about you
[1:25:53] when he comes to you to remind you oh
[1:25:55] brother ron you guys i'll say the same
[1:25:57] thing get us to know who we are it's
[1:26:00] very important
[1:26:02] because god's not only saw you as an
[1:26:04] attribute in the lamb's book before the
[1:26:07] foundation of the world
[1:26:10] think about it he watched over you
[1:26:16] through every generation
[1:26:20] through every war
[1:26:22] through every turmoil
[1:26:27] and your family may have been some of
[1:26:28] the biggest wretches that ever been in
[1:26:30] the world
[1:26:32] but your seat
[1:26:37] think about it one in a million
[1:26:43] god watched over that seed of life
[1:26:46] not just with your mother and father but
[1:26:49] all the way back through
[1:26:55] he watched over you
[1:26:59] he knew what color hair you would have
[1:27:01] what your bill would be like what your
[1:27:03] personality would be like
[1:27:05] god's a great artist
[1:27:10] he watched over you to make you exactly
[1:27:12] how you would be don't you put yourself
[1:27:14] down
[1:27:17] you're god's canvas
[1:27:21] god's been working on you way more than
[1:27:24] just a few decades he's been walked away
[1:27:26] looking on you for 2 000 36 000 years
[1:27:30] all the way back
[1:27:33] when jesus was on the earth your
[1:27:35] attributes were walking in somebody's
[1:27:37] body
[1:27:39] somebody was carrying you
[1:27:50] and satan thinks he can destroy you now
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:03] let's just go to another realm
[1:28:05] when jesus was on the cross you was
[1:28:07] inside of him
[1:28:11] god sent him to hell
[1:28:13] so you wouldn't have to go
[1:28:19] david whom i've been reading from this
[1:28:21] morning said i will not suffer my holy
[1:28:24] one to see corruption
[1:28:27] and you were on the inside of him
[1:28:30] are you with me
[1:28:32] if corruption could not touch you in
[1:28:35] jesus body 2 000 years ago
[1:28:38] satan don't have a chance to die
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:43] hallelujah
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:56] hallelujah
[1:29:11] we are in our season
[1:29:15] blueberries have a season blackberries
[1:29:17] have a season
[1:29:21] we're in the bright season
[1:29:25] it's our season
[1:29:31] we're in the blending of dimensions
[1:29:35] we are the book of acts that brother
[1:29:37] adam talked about
[1:29:40] it's been written
[1:29:42] in our lives
[1:29:44] and i want to reiterate that statement
[1:29:46] and there's nothing that satan can do to
[1:29:48] stop it
[1:30:02] that stupid devil
[1:30:18] just over a year and a half
[1:30:23] i started getting some interesting
[1:30:25] presents
[1:30:27] i didn't know what i was getting but
[1:30:30] i was thankful for them
[1:30:33] brother tim pruitt would give me rocks
[1:30:35] from where the same valley that david
[1:30:37] picked up those stones
[1:30:40] actually those stones were placed by
[1:30:42] angels
[1:30:45] and they defeated giants
[1:30:50] those stones had laid there for
[1:30:52] thousands of years and they'd defeated
[1:30:54] giants before
[1:30:56] and so brother
[1:30:58] tim was having some stones picked up to
[1:31:00] bring me
[1:31:02] they'd been giant killers before
[1:31:07] when god rained rained those stones down
[1:31:10] on those armies
[1:31:13] and so now given to me
[1:31:16] before i would know anything
[1:31:19] because there was a
[1:31:21] goliath going to raise his head
[1:31:26] we had brother kelly hildebrandt that
[1:31:27] was going to come to speak for us in the
[1:31:30] november before
[1:31:32] we got our
[1:31:34] news
[1:31:36] and brother kelly was supposed to be
[1:31:38] there on friday
[1:31:40] and his flight was stopped
[1:31:44] saturday his flight was stopped even
[1:31:46] saturday evening flight was stopped
[1:31:48] so he was going to fly through the night
[1:31:51] and get there on sunday
[1:31:55] i actually changed the service to where
[1:31:57] i said
[1:31:59] satan's trying to stop a message
[1:32:05] he's trying to stop a message and that's
[1:32:07] the only thing he's trying to do is stop
[1:32:08] a message
[1:32:10] from coming
[1:32:11] god has got something to say to us
[1:32:17] i saw a coin on brother kelly's desk and
[1:32:19] i really liked it
[1:32:21] and brother kelly was going to bring
[1:32:23] this coin and he was going to preach a
[1:32:25] sermon from it
[1:32:28] and it was a storm it was a
[1:32:30] a commemorative coin remembering the
[1:32:33] normandy d-day
[1:32:36] of 1944
[1:32:39] world war ii
[1:32:41] and a grain of sand on it
[1:32:43] it's actually it's actually embedded in
[1:32:46] the plastic of this coin
[1:32:50] a grain of sand
[1:32:53] if you remember those grains of sand
[1:32:55] that brother branham talks about with
[1:32:57] abraham he said
[1:33:00] he said abraham can you can you count
[1:33:03] the sand
[1:33:07] so shall thy seek be
[1:33:10] look at the stars can you count the
[1:33:12] stars
[1:33:14] so shall thy seed be
[1:33:17] that was more than just a saying
[1:33:21] i'll just give you a little background
[1:33:22] here is that okay
[1:33:25] anyway we had a brother in our church he
[1:33:28] had been a very
[1:33:30] kind of a rough individual
[1:33:33] i say rough very delicately
[1:33:39] in the latter years of his life he
[1:33:41] starts coming to church he said i would
[1:33:43] have never thought i'd ever sit in a
[1:33:45] church
[1:33:46] god knows
[1:33:48] his name was max
[1:33:51] max had ran the beach
[1:33:53] normandy
[1:33:56] and he said i watched
[1:33:58] as the thousands died
[1:34:01] he says i left the boat men were being
[1:34:03] killed
[1:34:04] and i was still alive
[1:34:07] he said i ran in those bloody waters
[1:34:09] expecting to die any second
[1:34:12] and i was still alive
[1:34:14] he said when i got on the sand there was
[1:34:16] just bodies laying everywhere and i was
[1:34:18] still alive
[1:34:20] he said i just kept running
[1:34:24] and he said when i got to the wall
[1:34:27] i was still alive
[1:34:29] one night i was preaching on the
[1:34:31] preservation of a seed
[1:34:36] how god watches over you
[1:34:39] in the midst of a storm in the midst of
[1:34:41] a war in the midst of illness god
[1:34:44] watches over you
[1:34:45] he
[1:34:46] preserves you
[1:34:48] when you can't preserve yourself and he
[1:34:51] said i sat there
[1:34:55] and i realized as i ran that beach that
[1:34:58] morning it was god
[1:35:12] so when i saw it at brother kelly's
[1:35:15] it meant absolutely incredible amount to
[1:35:17] me
[1:35:20] so brother kelly walks to the pulpit
[1:35:22] that night
[1:35:25] on a sunday evening
[1:35:27] and he describes how that
[1:35:30] satan had tried to keep him from getting
[1:35:33] there
[1:35:35] and he said i believe my message
[1:35:38] has been
[1:35:39] he's tried to stop the message
[1:35:42] and he said tonight
[1:35:44] i'm going to speak from the backside of
[1:35:46] this coin
[1:35:48] we will accept
[1:35:49] nothing less
[1:35:51] than full victory
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:36:08] we did not realize that in the coming
[1:36:11] days
[1:36:12] of what would be announced to us
[1:36:16] december the 22nd
[1:36:20] god spoke to me
[1:36:23] you say well brother ron i
[1:36:25] i don't know about these guys that see
[1:36:27] visions or hear voice of the lord
[1:36:29] let me just let me just tell you now
[1:36:32] i'm not expecting my critic to believe
[1:36:34] it
[1:36:44] but god spoke to me that morning
[1:36:47] and he used these words
[1:36:49] if you trust me
[1:36:54] i'll use you like never before
[1:36:58] i had no idea of what was getting ready
[1:37:02] to face me in the coming days
[1:37:04] but it did not surprise god
[1:37:10] i can stand here with courage and
[1:37:12] confidence and i want to echo this
[1:37:15] it may not be your testimony this
[1:37:17] morning but whatever trial that you're
[1:37:19] going through
[1:37:20] take courage
[1:37:24] god saw your trial before you ever got
[1:37:27] into
[1:37:32] it i would go to brother biscuits
[1:37:36] i would take the test i would take the
[1:37:38] scans and i would go to brother biscuits
[1:37:40] they'll let you just continue my my
[1:37:42] agenda and i would go to bed of the
[1:37:44] biscuits and i would preach three
[1:37:46] sermons
[1:37:48] one was courage
[1:37:51] the second was was take it back
[1:37:55] the third one was naaman was a leper
[1:37:58] and was totally cleansed
[1:38:03] i would get the message at
[1:38:06] at the hotel
[1:38:10] actually i would get the message as i'm
[1:38:12] going to speak on courage i get the
[1:38:15] message that i have cancer
[1:38:18] and it's not it's in my lungs
[1:38:21] they can see it in my lungs
[1:38:28] they had sent a i was going to travel
[1:38:30] alone
[1:38:32] and so because of
[1:38:34] the rates of the tickets
[1:38:37] and
[1:38:38] the doctor sent news to sister connie
[1:38:40] whatever you do you be with him because
[1:38:42] he's going to get some news while he's
[1:38:44] there
[1:38:46] sister connie called the airline
[1:38:49] thank you brother brian
[1:38:51] called the airline
[1:38:54] and she got a seat beside of me on every
[1:38:57] leg of that flight
[1:39:03] and you that fly you know what i'm
[1:39:04] talking about right there
[1:39:09] and they called us and told us that
[1:39:13] we're we're
[1:39:14] perfectly confident that you have cancer
[1:39:16] in your lungs
[1:39:18] and so
[1:39:20] we would go there is this okay to tell
[1:39:22] it
[1:39:25] and so we would go we would i would
[1:39:27] preach those three sermons
[1:39:29] and i thought it was no small
[1:39:30] coincidence that
[1:39:32] brother biskell had interviewed brother
[1:39:35] charlie mitchell who had cancer in his
[1:39:37] lung
[1:39:38] and i thought god you're so perfect in
[1:39:40] your timing i'm speaking for brother
[1:39:43] bischo
[1:39:48] and he's sitting right there and i'm
[1:39:50] standing here with the words that you've
[1:39:52] got cancer
[1:39:58] and we would go home and we would have
[1:40:00] one biopsy after another biopsy any of
[1:40:02] you that's ever been through biopsies
[1:40:04] they're very difficult
[1:40:06] and i had a tumor that was right beside
[1:40:08] of the heart
[1:40:10] and they were going to do a biopsy on it
[1:40:12] you have doctors here you they know what
[1:40:13] you're talking about
[1:40:15] and they're very they're very painful
[1:40:17] and so anyway
[1:40:19] they had put me there was about eight
[1:40:21] different doctors and then there was
[1:40:22] eight attendants that was with them and
[1:40:24] i was getting ready to
[1:40:27] and they were just rolling me every
[1:40:28] which away and trying to get me position
[1:40:31] right so they could put the needles in
[1:40:34] and uh taking the
[1:40:37] exam and
[1:40:38] before they did it
[1:40:40] finally one of the doctors came to me
[1:40:42] and he said ron i just want to tell you
[1:40:44] this i
[1:40:45] i know you're thinking that
[1:40:47] those they're gone because you're a
[1:40:49] preacher
[1:40:51] and i said yes sir he said well
[1:40:53] he said this is the deal
[1:40:55] he said you've got so many we just don't
[1:40:57] know which one to get
[1:40:59] and the one that we're after is in a
[1:41:01] very dangerous spot
[1:41:04] and so he rolled me over on my stomach
[1:41:06] and
[1:41:07] he finally come around and he said ron i
[1:41:10] want to pray with you
[1:41:13] and he said these words in my ear
[1:41:16] your god has got this
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:33] it would become back it was cancer
[1:41:36] and they would find out it's a melanoma
[1:41:38] cancer and
[1:41:40] it's a fast spreader it's a
[1:41:42] it's a lot of different things it's a
[1:41:44] devil
[1:41:46] brother wayne
[1:41:48] who i think is one of the most powerful
[1:41:49] preachers on the war in the world
[1:41:53] don't don't take that for granted
[1:41:55] don't take that gift for granted
[1:41:58] you know a lot of times we have a
[1:42:00] meeting and blind eyes come open and we
[1:42:02] all rejoice
[1:42:04] but brother wayne was scheduled i
[1:42:05] believe it was in march to come to my
[1:42:07] place to speak
[1:42:09] and
[1:42:11] said to bethany would come and she would
[1:42:13] sing in my house and
[1:42:15] we would have a wonderful time
[1:42:20] and
[1:42:22] we went to red lobster
[1:42:25] and
[1:42:26] and i went blind in my left side
[1:42:29] my vision was very distorted
[1:42:33] you know satan is stupid
[1:42:41] he's just stupid
[1:42:47] and so
[1:42:48] brother wayne
[1:42:49] prays for me that weekend and
[1:42:52] we have phenomenal services which is no
[1:42:54] surprise to anybody
[1:42:57] just phenomenal
[1:43:00] and i go to the eye doctor the next
[1:43:01] morning he sends me to uva and
[1:43:04] then they send me through all kinds of
[1:43:06] tests and tests and tests
[1:43:08] and it was a guy that worked in the eye
[1:43:10] clinic a technician
[1:43:13] that said hey he's got something going
[1:43:15] on in his brain
[1:43:16] they had just ran an mri just only
[1:43:19] weeks before and said there's nothing
[1:43:21] there
[1:43:23] and here we are just a few weeks later
[1:43:26] and they run an mri later that evening
[1:43:30] and i'll just have to tell you it was
[1:43:31] breathtaking
[1:43:33] when they walk in and say you have a
[1:43:34] tumor about that size on the back of
[1:43:36] your brain that's cutting your vision
[1:43:38] off and you've got two more that's there
[1:43:41] how long have you known you had brain
[1:43:42] cancer
[1:43:43] and
[1:43:44] we didn't know it
[1:43:47] now i have to tell you there are some
[1:43:48] storms you don't see coming
[1:43:53] but when i came to realize
[1:43:57] when i came to realize that brother
[1:43:59] wayne's coming
[1:44:02] satan made a bad move
[1:44:08] and had he just left it alone just a few
[1:44:11] days
[1:44:12] i would have never preached another
[1:44:13] sermon
[1:44:15] i'd have went to a premature grave
[1:44:20] remember the scripture all things work
[1:44:22] together for you're good
[1:44:27] so let me just say this now even as i'm
[1:44:30] preaching don't give up on your children
[1:44:34] don't give up on your loved ones
[1:44:37] it may look entrappily terrible right
[1:44:39] now
[1:44:40] but god's got a plan
[1:44:44] [Applause]
[1:44:54] because of you who you are every move
[1:44:58] that satan makes against you
[1:45:01] god has allowed him and give him
[1:45:02] permission
[1:45:04] because remember he can't touch a half
[1:45:06] your head until he gets permission from
[1:45:08] god and god's got confidence in you that
[1:45:11] you can make it through the trial
[1:45:13] these are more than quotes these are
[1:45:16] more than scriptures
[1:45:18] he is our refuge
[1:45:20] he is our strength
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:31] hallelujah
[1:45:34] and i want to stand here my declaration
[1:45:36] is very clear
[1:45:38] we will accept nothing less
[1:45:44] then total victory
[1:45:49] [Applause]
[1:45:59] hallelujah
[1:46:02] hallelujah
[1:46:08] sometimes we just have to make our stand
[1:46:14] let me just say this to you when it's
[1:46:16] happening at somebody else's house
[1:46:19] it's easy to make a stand
[1:46:26] what will you do under pressure
[1:46:29] because you are what you are under
[1:46:31] pressure
[1:46:36] are you with me
[1:46:38] when somebody in your family says they
[1:46:40] don't believe the message no longer
[1:46:43] and they question everything in the
[1:46:44] world around you
[1:46:46] you know who you are
[1:46:51] you know who you are
[1:46:53] just stand strong
[1:47:00] pressure is what you're built for
[1:47:04] man woman boy or girl
[1:47:07] we're built to stand the pressure
[1:47:12] god knows what you can handle what you
[1:47:13] can handle
[1:47:15] and he prevents the devil
[1:47:18] from coming at you he's watched over
[1:47:20] your trial he's actually the greatest
[1:47:22] strategist and the greatest general
[1:47:24] that's ever been
[1:47:27] so understand if you have came into a
[1:47:30] trial
[1:47:32] not of your own making
[1:47:36] but if you come into a trial
[1:47:40] and you see it satan has come against
[1:47:42] you
[1:47:42] to buff it and beat you
[1:47:45] i want to quote some scriptures to you
[1:47:46] be strong and
[1:47:48] good courage
[1:47:52] can we just say it
[1:47:53] we are sons and daughters of god
[1:48:00] we were built to fight
[1:48:04] and the greatest armor that you've got
[1:48:05] is his word
[1:48:08] and prayer before god
[1:48:13] are you with me take your sword out and
[1:48:15] never put it back
[1:48:18] i want to remind you is this okay
[1:48:20] we don't back up
[1:48:24] we don't back down
[1:48:26] we fight
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:29] he shelters us under his wings
[1:48:34] he fights our battles
[1:48:37] he wins our wars
[1:48:40] we cast out satan
[1:48:43] with holy ghost
[1:48:44] boldness
[1:48:46] and he authors has authorized us and
[1:48:48] give us empowered us to use the name of
[1:48:52] jesus for every need at any time
[1:48:56] under any condition
[1:48:58] any place
[1:49:05] we have been declared an invincible army
[1:49:11] hallelujah
[1:49:13] i feel like joshua preaching the last
[1:49:15] sermon
[1:49:18] hallelujah if any bride is prepared to
[1:49:20] take the land we are
[1:49:26] we are
[1:49:29] i don't care what we face
[1:49:32] it may hurt and it may sting
[1:49:34] this ain't hollywood
[1:49:37] there's a lot of sickness that i've had
[1:49:39] to face in the last year and a half
[1:49:41] tuesday i was in the hospital getting a
[1:49:44] bump i knew i wanted to be here
[1:49:47] i don't want satan to steal one thing
[1:49:49] away from me
[1:49:58] i want to remind you if god be for me
[1:50:00] who can be against me
[1:50:06] george washington was persistent at
[1:50:08] valley forge
[1:50:11] all the odds was against him
[1:50:14] the enemy was across the river
[1:50:16] but after all night in prayer they are
[1:50:19] the american soldiers with no shoes on
[1:50:21] their feet
[1:50:22] about one-third of them had shoes and
[1:50:24] they crossed the the river at valley
[1:50:26] forge through the ice
[1:50:29] and three musket bullets went through
[1:50:32] george washington's coat
[1:50:34] but he had an answer from god
[1:50:37] and there was no need of him backing
[1:50:40] down
[1:50:41] nothing
[1:50:42] could stop him then
[1:50:46] he crossed the river because he was
[1:50:49] persistent
[1:50:50] he had heard
[1:50:53] from god
[1:50:58] i want to ask you have you heard from
[1:51:01] god
[1:51:06] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:51:09] the spirit of the lord raises up a
[1:51:11] standard
[1:51:12] against him
[1:51:17] are you with me
[1:51:18] i want to preach to every individual
[1:51:20] here now
[1:51:22] refuse to retreat
[1:51:29] refuse to retreat
[1:51:34] never never never give up
[1:51:37] i want you to say that with me i'll
[1:51:40] never
[1:51:40] never
[1:51:41] never give up
[1:51:49] the most supernatural thing about you is
[1:51:51] your tongue
[1:51:52] it has the power of life and death in it
[1:51:57] satan may put negative thoughts in your
[1:52:00] mind don't let them go across your
[1:52:01] tongue
[1:52:03] you have the power to create an
[1:52:04] atmosphere around you
[1:52:06] that's the reason we come and shout and
[1:52:08] we sing is we're creating an atmosphere
[1:52:11] for god inhabits in the praises of his
[1:52:14] people
[1:52:16] you want to know where god's at he's
[1:52:17] with people that know how to praise him
[1:52:20] they praise him in a storm they praise
[1:52:23] him on the mountaintops they praise him
[1:52:25] in the violence
[1:52:28] [Applause]
[1:52:35] and if anything you get from this this
[1:52:38] morning
[1:52:39] you've heard me preach now
[1:52:41] 20 some 20 maybe 26 years
[1:52:44] and are in almost in a row
[1:52:47] i preach to you with all my strength but
[1:52:50] i can stand here in the midst of a storm
[1:52:53] and be just as positive
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:01] i'm not depending on my flesh i'm
[1:53:03] depending on the word of god
[1:53:09] are you with me now
[1:53:11] that's the same with the rapture
[1:53:15] i'm not depending on how i feel or what
[1:53:18] i see
[1:53:19] his word said that the resurrection is
[1:53:21] getting ready to happen and we're
[1:53:23] getting ready to get a change of our
[1:53:25] bodies
[1:53:26] it's not an if
[1:53:30] it's just a win
[1:53:32] and we are in the season for it
[1:53:40] [Applause]
[1:53:47] i'd like to say this to you when brother
[1:53:48] branham bowed on his knees with that
[1:53:50] little finland boy
[1:53:54] he knew what the vision said
[1:53:59] he knew what god said
[1:54:01] it didn't matter if he had a thousand
[1:54:03] critics around
[1:54:06] he told them he said if this little
[1:54:07] boy's not off of the ground in five
[1:54:09] minutes you call me a false prophet he
[1:54:11] knew where he stood
[1:54:13] listened to him he said you could have
[1:54:14] satan could have lined up every devil in
[1:54:16] hell and they couldn't have stopped it
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:26] i don't care what the critics say that
[1:54:28] that didn't happen it happened just the
[1:54:30] way brother random said it did
[1:54:32] now i want to tell you this
[1:54:36] one morning when you look out and see
[1:54:38] your loved ones walk down the road
[1:54:43] standing in a brand new party
[1:54:46] they'll take a step this way and you'll
[1:54:47] take a step that way
[1:54:51] let the heathen rage and the critics
[1:54:54] scream
[1:54:55] i believe this word with all my heart
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:01] [Applause]
[1:55:10] he's never lost a case
[1:55:12] he's never been in a crisis
[1:55:15] he has never lied
[1:55:17] he's never failed
[1:55:19] and he's always on time
[1:55:23] he's made a decision and he's never
[1:55:25] changed his mind about what he's going
[1:55:26] to do
[1:55:28] he has unlimited power
[1:55:42] brother braham said we must have trials
[1:55:44] intestines
[1:55:46] and times to prove our faith
[1:55:49] every son that cometh to god must first
[1:55:51] be tried and chastened of god
[1:55:54] you mustn't question anything to god for
[1:55:56] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:55:58] ordered of the lord
[1:56:01] every trial is put upon you to prove you
[1:56:05] and the bible said they're more precious
[1:56:07] to you than gold
[1:56:15] if god can let a few uh light
[1:56:18] afflictions happen to you
[1:56:20] remember it's correction for you
[1:56:23] every son that cometh to god must first
[1:56:25] be chastened of god

[1:59:55] he stood there night after night after
[1:59:57] night after night and could not disprove
[2:00:00] it then
[2:00:04] he comes to this church trying to
[2:00:06] disprove you over and over and over
[2:00:08] again that's why he fights so hard
[2:00:10] against you he don't have long to work
[2:00:13] on you
[2:00:15] and he wars at you and he wars at you
[2:00:18] and he whispers in your ear
[2:00:21] but god is our refuge and our sins
[2:00:27] [Applause]
[2:00:31] and i want to tell you what an
[2:00:33] inspirational song this morning the

[2:04:14] now satan's wanting to raise his ugly
[2:04:17] head
[2:04:19] he likes to make storms in individuals
[2:04:22] lives
[2:04:23] and he does it individually because the
[2:04:25] rapture is going to happen individually
[2:04:28] so he does it individually to attack
[2:04:31] but when that individual realizes who
[2:04:33] they are and what they are and what
[2:04:34] they've been called for
[2:04:36] they individually pull their sword out
[2:04:39] and they make their stand
[2:04:41] and they realize that god is their
[2:04:43] refuge and their strength
[2:04:45] and when they bring their lick of fire
[2:04:47] into the building like they've done this
[2:04:48] morning
[2:04:50] and they realize that the liberator is
[2:04:52] in the house
[2:04:54] the doctor is here
[2:04:59] hallelujah
[2:05:01] hallelujah
[2:05:03] satan i've told you a long time ago that
[2:05:06] this cancer is defeated in the name of
[2:05:08] jesus christ
[2:05:11] the same with all of the diseases across
[2:05:13] this building right now there's not a
[2:05:16] disease in the building that god can
[2:05:18] heal
[2:05:24] that individual that don't know you
[2:05:25] that's been running from the presence of
[2:05:27] the lord for for quite a long spell
[2:05:30] i pray that father that you'd inspire
[2:05:32] their heart right now this morning
[2:05:35] they don't have to leave this building
[2:05:37] the same that they walked in

[2:34:20] you wouldn't
[2:34:21] like like that like that brother said in
[2:34:23] the meeting dinner he said he don't look
[2:34:25] what he'd been through he don't look
[2:34:27] like what he's been through
[2:34:30] and he don't look like what he's going
[2:34:32] through
[2:34:33] but that's how a son of god goes through
[2:34:34] anything
[2:34:36] that's how he goes through anything and
[2:34:38] he's he's uh he you know i was sitting
[2:34:40] there watching brother ron preach and i
[2:34:43] thought my them devils are getting a
[2:34:45] whippen
[2:34:46] amen
[2:34:47] them devils are getting a whippet
[2:34:56] i've
[2:34:58] i've i've said in history class when i
[2:35:00] was a kid and i dreamed about setting
[2:35:04] in the camp around the fire when
[2:35:06] stonewall jackson come riding in and to
[2:35:09] hear him get off and address the troops
[2:35:11] and and talk to them about the
[2:35:13] about the faith and how they were going
[2:35:15] to press and you know this morning i was
[2:35:17] sitting there thought my i'm sitting i'm
[2:35:20] sitting and listening
[2:35:21] amen to something equivalent
[2:35:24] of a stonewall jackson talking
[2:35:26] to an army
[2:35:28] he said brother wayne is that really no
[2:35:30] no
[2:35:31] i would rather be sitting in this
[2:35:32] meeting this morning than i had at the
[2:35:35] campfires of stonewall jackson
[2:35:38] what about when winston churchill walked
[2:35:40] in and the nazi army was taking over the
[2:35:42] entire world and and it looked like
[2:35:45] everything was against them do you all
[2:35:46] know that they didn't have a fighting
[2:35:48] chance
[2:35:49] but winston churchill walked to the
[2:35:51] platform through the medium of radio and
[2:35:53] spread the word across the entire
[2:35:55] english continent and our country and he
[2:35:58] began to say to them we shall fight
[2:36:00] these nazis
[2:36:02] on the beaches
[2:36:04] he said we'll fight them in the streets
[2:36:06] we'll fight them and he named a bunch of
[2:36:08] places he said and we shall do it he
[2:36:10] said but one thing we shall not
[2:36:13] surrender
[2:36:15] and i thought this morning listening to
[2:36:17] a man preached like that and if you if
[2:36:19] you you you you're hearing the same
[2:36:22] courage not a natural but in a spiritual
[2:36:26] realm when this bride's being attacked
[2:36:28] from every corner she's being attacked
[2:36:30] by every unbelieving every spirit of
[2:36:32] infirmity every devil out of hell has
[2:36:35] raised itself up and and pushed against
[2:36:37] this church and here stands a man
[2:36:39] preaching with cancer in his body and
[2:36:42] and the spirits of discouragement saying
[2:36:44] you shouldn't get up there today you
[2:36:46] shouldn't go up there and preach those
[2:36:47] meetings you shouldn't do it the spirits
[2:36:49] of doubt saying it'll never make a
[2:36:51] difference it'll never be there and he
[2:36:53] silenced every voice of every critic
[2:36:56] every voice of every disturbance and
[2:36:59] stood right here and announced that
[2:37:00] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[2:37:04] and forever and it don't matter if
[2:37:06] there's cancer in your body it doesn't
[2:37:08] matter if there's trouble in your life
[2:37:10] or there's a storm going our god is a
[2:37:13] mighty conqueror this morning and we
[2:37:15] have not been defeated and we will not
[2:37:18] be defeated because we are the church of
[2:37:20] the living god and invincible art let me
[2:37:23] ask you something if not now when will
[2:37:25] we be

[2:37:29] the people but i believe this is that
[2:37:31] that has been prophesied this is the
[2:37:34] hour amen of the presence of the
[2:37:36] almighty god and i believe we got a
[2:37:38] right to rejoice this morning i believe
[2:37:40] we i believe we can do it brother david
[2:37:42] i know we go through storms and trials

[2:38:03] heaven full of angels
[2:38:06] he had the moon and the stars and the
[2:38:08] sun and they never failed to praise him
[2:38:11] amen at any hour at any time amen but
