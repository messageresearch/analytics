thankful for what the lord has done amen we're really uh we we appreciate it brother andrew spencer your message last night very much amen we're real privileged to have brother timothy pruitt come to speak with us tonight amen uh there's hardly a young person around this message it's not been blessed by brother timothy's ministry both in preaching and also in the in the camp down there in louisiana i went nine years myself before marriage disqualified me and and uh my what a uh to to tell the things that the lord did for me in those meetings amen and not only uh brother timothy but we got two brothers on the platform tonight amen that uh that have done so much for the youth the message brother paula fontaine with the winter youth retreat amen we just appreciate these brothers that have a heart for you and i our generation amen [Music] amen amen we just want to say of course you know there's nothing in our hearts with this with the this weekend meetings that would compete with anybody we don't think that we're doing anything better than anybody amen that's not the spirit of the encampment but the spirit of the encampment is that somehow some way we may be able to pay forward amen the blessings that we've received because of the sacrifices and the laborers of these brothers amen you know brother timothy is a man who loves these young people he must he loves you very much and there's a great must be a great burden in his heart amen to be here in this hour amen of loss and grief that his family is going through with the loss of sister karen pruitt amen but the lord has brought him here i believe he's brought him for a purpose and what do we want to do as young people we want to get behind brother timothy tonight we want to pull on the word of god we want to support the ministry amen because that's how we can be fed how many would testify with a raised hand that you've got a hunger in your heart tonight for the lord amen did you know that the lord knows what it's like to hunger amen as the old song says he came down from his glory and we're serving a god that left the splinters of heaven and laid aside the cosmic powers of creation to as the brother branham said pitch his tent with us amen and because he pitched his tent with us he knows what it's like to be sad he knows what it's like to endure temptation whatever you're going through young people tonight young man young lady amen god knows right where you're at amen as brother paul prayed he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities amen he stood there and he preached amen and and brought us the word and amen and brought that message of redemption to his day amen and and labored for us until he became hungry can you imagine that the creator of the universe would stand on a hill in galilee and feel hunger pains down in his stomach amen just to know what you're going through amen and he felt those hunger pains and he said these words blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled amen that's the purpose why he came the reason he endured those things amen and so he could relate to us so he could have compassion upon us so he could just have fellowship with his children and he's here to fellowship with you tonight and if you've got a hunger in your heart he's here to meet it i believe that don't you amen amen as brother timothy comes let's sing that song we sang last night amen i need you lord i need you lord right now i need you lord i need you lord right now just express that hunger to him

our greetings from our home church even like tabernacle i was going to have them stand but they've already stood today and and we're very thankful for them to come it's kind of a different situation for them you know um normally buses are coming to us or vans are coming to us and the roads were reversed and so we was able to get a bus for them to come i think it was around 50 folks it was on that bus and and uh you know they was thinking about well uh how's it going to be you know what's my dorm going to be like am i going to have any friends in my dorm and so things are a little bit different for them but that's good different is good sometimes amen but we're i'm thankful for them to be here today and uh amen we're just here to have a good time in the lord amen god bless you today thank you brother ray for your invitation and brother nathan and all that's involved brother wayne amen these things don't just happen it takes a lot of work to go into them and a lot of energy and we're thankful for every effort no matter what you do and what if you're picking up trash whatever you're doing it don't matter every effort will be worth it all amen god bless you tonight exodus 2 and verse 23 and he said it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by the reason of bondage and they cried and their cry came up to god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and jacob and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them next chapter now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of medium and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight while the bush is not burned and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not not hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob and moses hit his face for he is afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and enlarge into a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hibites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come unto me and i have also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppress them it doesn't look like god misses anything amen come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go into pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token of thee that i've sent thee when thou has brought forth the people of egypt you shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i'm come to the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and moses said it and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob has sent me unto you and this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations amen god bless you today you can be seated i'd like to speak to you on a little thought that lord began to set upon my heart as i would come to these meetings loose them and let them go loose them and let them go you know it's a very wonderful thing to read the scripture as we have read and to understand that this is a god who hears and understands he understands your situations he understands your problems he understands exactly where you're at every moment of the day he knows exactly the feelings that you're having he's been through every one of them he's he as brother nathan was saying he's felt hunger he's felt for being forsaken he's felt the the feelings of humanity and he's a god who hears and understands i want you to understand this god has heard your cry he has heard your request he has seen your tears he he has seen and under and heard the questions that are in your hearts i i want you to understand tonight you're serving a personal god not just a god who's somewhere way off somewhere out there in the clouds somewhere but he's a very present god for a present need and this is what he was telling them and telling moses as you stood here when they ask you who i am you tell them i am that i am in other words i am present that whatever you have need of i'm present for that so if you need a healer i am if you need a savior i am if you need a deliverer i am if you need a waymaker i am if you need a promise keeper i am if you need a comforter i am if you need a god i am if you need a friend i am i am whatever you have need of in your present situation and he also was showing moses that he's not just a god of history although he was a god of abraham isaac and jacob but he was also showing him i'm the same yesterday today and forever and this is what he wants to get across to unto you young people maybe in these meetings that he wants you to understand that he's not just a god of history sure he showed himself powerly powerfully 50 years ago or 60 years ago and and many many times down through your parents life and maybe sometimes in your lives but he wants you to understand that tonight i am that i am jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever because if he's just a god of yesterday but not a god of today he's not a god at all but he is a god that right now can meet any need touch any heart change any life it doesn't matter how bad you're covered up in sin it doesn't matter if you've been a backslider for however many years this is a god who can meet your needs who can change your life who can touch you and turn you around you might be going down the wrong path tonight but this god is big enough to take care of you this god is big enough to take the challenge of any devil in hell that would try to rise up and try to come against you this god is big enough and he's a present god so it's not one that's miles away or even in another country somewhere or it's distance and or he's unaware of what's going on this god is very personal he knows what it's like to ask why amen he knows exactly because he would say it there on the cross why hast thou forsaken me so he also knows a feeling of feeling forsaken amen he knows what it's like to go through social distancing and feel forsaken and all alone and nobody cares and nobody understands he knows all about it therefore he had put in his word i will never leave you or forsake you because i know what they're feeling is like i know what it's like to feel like i'm all by myself and nobody cares and nobody understands and nobody wants to even know about my troubles he knows all about that but so he had put something in his word that when you feel forsaken he'll put that in his word and said i won't forsake you amen men may forsake you friends may forsake you every kind of the word all things of the world is going to move away and forsake but there's a god here tonight that promises i'm your friend that's sticking closer than a brother that when you're in the hardest trials of your life when you're going through the deepest darkest moments of your life i'm there amen when you're in tears and you're in sorrow i'm there amen when you can't find comfort i'm there when you can't find somebody to lean on i'm there hallelujah this is a friend amen that wants to be your friend closer than anyone here in this building closer than your mama and your daddy you can find somebody that you can rest upon he knows the feeling and he's heard your cry he's seen what the devil has been doing to you and he has come down to deliver oh hallelujah now this god is a supernatural god he's not an intellectual god he's a supernatural god and he has supernatural signs and supernatural wonders and there's a supernatural in the midst when he comes down that's moses when he came down now moses had tried him on his own he tried to amen to deliver the children of israel he had tried to bring him out as as he knew the promises they'd been given for and so he tried and he produced a dead egyptian so he's fleeing out there on the back side of the desert and he's all alone and he's thinking god's done for god but god hasn't forgot it's been 40 years but god hasn't forgot amen it's been 50 60 years since the prophet's been gone but god hasn't forgot hallelujah his word is still true those that are alive and remain shall be changed amen he hasn't forgot one of his promises he hasn't forgot one dot of his word he knows and he knows all about it and he still has the power to bring it to pass in your life hallelujah and so moses is out there wandering around and taking care of a few sheep and he sees something that's very supernatural amen no he may he couldn't explain it he couldn't describe it he couldn't exactly tell exactly all about it so he thought i'll go see it because something's going on there's a bush that's on fire but it's not burning and he walks up there and he begins to approach it and a voice speaks out of the bush it was a supernatural thing that took place and he told moses i am that i am it was showing them always present tense not i was not or not i will be but i am i've come down to show you that i am your deliverer oh hallelujah i pray that same pillar of fire falls in this building tonight that'll come down and show you i'm not just the preacher's deliverer or mama's deliverer or daddy's deliver or the deacons deliver i'm your deliverer i'm your satisfier i'm your god not just their god i'm your god [Applause] and i want you to understand when that voice spoke pharaoh lost his power now pharaoh may not have realized it he may not understood it but when that voice spoke and said you go tell him let my people go pharaoh's power was true oh my amen he lost his power his day was over with and god began to plague his kingdom we know the story as moses would go down there and it must have been a suit it had to be a supernatural visitation because it so inspired moses that he took a rod and a donkey and a wife and a child and he goes down to egypt where you going moses i'm going down to take over take over what i'm going over to take over egypt moses do you understand that egypt is the greatest nation in the world and they got the greatest military power and they got all the uh all the most sophisticated instruments and things and and there's you got what do you got moses where's your army you're looking at it where's your power you're looking at it amen what you got moses i got a rod and then this rod there's some power in it and this rod is going to destroy pharaoh's kingdom in this rock and not only do i got a rod i got a pillar of fire hallelujah amen amen he goes down he begins to take over the greatest nation that had ever been on earth at that time with a rod and a donkey and a child and a and a wife come on now and he began to plague pharaoh's kingdom amen to where every god of egypt was destroyed they made everything of god the nile was a god amen dagin and all those the god of the flies and the god he destroyed every one of them amen by the power of god amen i want you to understand children of god amen we're not just looking almost whatever 5 000 years ago at a pillar of fire we've got one in our day amen there's a pillar of fire that has appeared in this day and i want you to understand something he didn't leave when the prophet left [Applause] it's still visible among us it's still touching hearts it's still touching lives and no wonder somebody will get so inspired they'll grab the word of god a promise and say i'm going down to laodicea and i'm going to take over i'm going to take over every devil in hell i'm going to walk above it oh hallelujah there's a voice that has spoken out of that pillar of fire and when that voice spoke in our generation satan lost his power the

lost his ability of anxieties to hold you in fear to hold you and every kind of unbelief to hold you we are the very proof that satan has lost his power you are the very proof right in the face of hell you lost your power hallelujah mercy exodus 14 1 i'll just say it like this i was standing there brother my brother paul and reached over to me he said look he said you go preach like your mama

to get after him with the word of god and destroy that thing i want you to know children of god i've come with a rod tonight and this riot still parts the red sea this rod still going to destroy satan this rod will still destroy the egyptians this rod is still just as powerful as this heaven pier i'll go ahead and give him praise if we could hear the cloud of witnesses tonight then we'd be saying charge don't give up if you only knew the reward they wait you at the end you would never stop you would never even think about quitting hallelujah devil says well i'm going to put a bunch of worry on you and a bunch of tears in your eyes and a bunch of uh uh depression and because you lost your mama no wrong again devil i stood at her bedside and she was about to take her last breath and i said mama if you're going i want you to say one thing for me when you get over there you let them know we're coming you let them know there's a people here that still believes the word of god you let them know we ain't giving up we ain't stopping we ain't turning around we're going out to the promised land oh hallelujah this was the word message for the exes in that day but we've also received a word for an exodus a message for an exodus in our day this message is not about just taking you out of somewhere and taking you out of egypt and taking you out amen it's also taking you in hallelujah that's what this message is about it took me out of my sins it took me out of my all the things around me the devil tried to put on me every kind of name tag he tried to put on me it took me out of all of that but it didn't just take me to leave me there it took me out of there so i could experience the heavenly of heavens and the glory of glories and see my god and jesus face to face hallelujah [Applause] so no i'm not a depressed man standing up here in front of you i've seen a woman die in faith i've seen a lot of them die in unfaith i guess what disbelief whatever you want to call it i've seen a lady stand there in faith she was an example godly example of faith i can't tell you how many times in a meeting that she would be in the just in this last year be very weak in her body and fighting through things spirit of god hit her and around the building she'd go yeah it still does that yeah i don't care how much they say it don't amen yeah i'm tired of that stinking rotten devil that wants to take the joy out of the hearts of men and women i feel like the man when people want to say i'm making a scene or i'm making um whatever they want to call it holy roller this that and the other whatever they want whatever name they want to put up brother brown said he said he ain't never seen the holy roller yet but anyway i'm like the man that was sitting in that wheelchair and he'd been told that he was healed and he began to confess it over i'm healed in the name of jesus i'm healed in the name of jesus you know he calls the scene in his town his family and they they be you're making a mockery of the word no you're not making a mockery when you confess the word that's all he was doing he was confessing the word by his stripes i'm healed and a bunch of preachers got backslidden apparently preachers come over there and begin to talk to him and said you know what you're making a mockery you you ought to be ashamed of himself he said sir if you were sitting in the seat i am if you were sitting where i'm sitting you wouldn't take the last hope from me by his stripes i'm healed and out of that seat he came and i want to tell those who want to say you need to shut up you need not be so loud and you need to not have so much worship if you were sitting where i was sitting and i was bound and lust and i was bound and sin and god raised me up from there i've got something to sing about i got something to shout about i have witnessed the power of the holy ghost in my life hallelujah well you say well brother timothy i've seen a lot of people shout and dance and they ain't got no victory they go right in pornography this well i've seen a lot of people that say they got the word and they're in pornography i didn't mean to go there but anyway amen amen it is it ain't the word the intellectuals the intellectual capabilities to understand something it's the life of the word he said they'll worship me in spirit and truth amen but anyway from chapter 14 and verse 1 says the lord speaking to moses now this is after all the plagues and we're skipping a lot of things all the plagues and things that are taken the death angel they come through the land he said speaking to the children of israel that they turn and encount before petheroth between migdal and the sea for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land and wilderness has shut them in and i will harden pharaoh's heart and he shall follow after them and i will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts that the egyptians may know that i am the lord now these must be some stupid people because apparently after all they've seen they still didn't know he's the lord i mean they've seen their their god of the nile turned to blood they've seen amen frogs as deep is all who knows how deep and flies and bowls and then their death of the firstborn and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the heart of pharaoh and his servants were turned against the people and they said why have we done this and we've let israel go from serving us and he made readiest chariot and took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and the captains over every one of them and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with a high hand but the egyptians pursued them and all the horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army and overtook them by encamping by the sea and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid now that's another paradox really it's interesting that al after all they've seen and all they witnessed they're afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there are no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt us with dealt with us with us to carry us forth out of egypt it's not this not the word that we detail thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians then that we and that we should die in the wilderness and moses said unto the how much sense does that make they've been dying for 400 years with a slave belt and now they're experiencing freedom and they're saying well we could have just died in egypt well if i'm going to die i'm going to die a free [Applause] man if i'm going to die i'm going to die a liberated man amen and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which has shown you this day for the egyptians which you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever remember that no more forever and the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace let me put in good old southern language the lord shall fight for you and you will shut up no hold your peace don't let the devil take your peace i mean i'm not going to sit sit here and try to paint a picture of that when you you get you get something at camp the devil don't come around and try to try to bluff at you and try to knock on your windows but hold your peace don't forget who's fighting for you hallelujah it's not just a pastor it's not just a brother or a friend somewhere that's fighting for you god is fighting for you [Applause] amen because if you don't hold your peace and hold your mouth you'll start letting your doubts out and your fear out and your unbelief listen my battles are going to be there it's one thing to think a thought is another thing to speak it amen brother brown talked about he said you you can you can keep a bird you can't keep them from flying over your head but you can keep them from building the nests in your hair i mean i haven't seen anybody here yet with a nest in the hair i don't think amen cause why you wouldn't let that bird come over you and start gathering limbs and sticking it in there and doing all no you'd chew him away you would take something and get rid of him if you had to in the south you'd take a gun and you'd shoot him. amen amen this is what you got to do with the devil you can't entertain his thoughts and you can't dwell upon them and think upon them you got to take them subject to the word of god and take this double barrel shotgun and blow him out of the sky and say devil i am not going that way no more i'm not living that way no more that's the old man but now i'm the new man hallelujah hold your peace lord said unto moses wherefore christ unto me speak to the children of israel that they go forward but lift up thy rod and stretch out the thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground in the midst of a sea wow what's going on in the midst of a sea and i behold i was will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all the hosts and upon his chariots and upon the horsemen ain't that amazing god was set in a trap for his enemy he had already before the foundation of the world as he was planting it in his mind he said i'm going to put a mountain range over here i'm going to put a c right there i'm going to put this over here because right down through here is where i'm going to bring my children one day and they're going to think that that pharaoh over there he's going to think that they've lost their way and they're entangled in the wilderness and and they've lost and he's going to try to come down but i'm going to set a trap for him hallelujah don't you know what laodicea is it's a trap not for you it's a trap for your enemy he's being invited into this realm not for your destruction but for his destruction [Music] hallelujah he's bringing him right down here to the place amen that he's going to die oh my and we know the stories they moved up amen the pillar of fire went and stood between the egyptians and the camp of israel and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong west east wind and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground and the waters were a wall on the right and on their left and the egyptians thought that's a pretty good idea let's go too and went after them in the midst of the sea even all pharaoh's horses all his chariots and all his horsemen and it came to pass in the morning watched the lord looked upon the host of egyptians to the pillar of fire in the cloud and troubled the host of egyptian and took off their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so the egyptians said let us flee from the face of the israel for the lord fighted for them against the egyptians and the lord said unto moses stretch out the hand of the sea and the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appear and the egyptians fled and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea and the waters returned and covered the chariots the horsemen and all the hosts of pharaoh that it came into the sea after them and there remained not so much as one of them but the children of israel walked upon dry land and the waters were a wall to their right into their left thus saved the israel lord saved israel that day out of the hands of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashore and something here because he said the egyptians that you see you'll see no more forever and then a few scriptures later they saw them on the seashore but their capabilities were different they no longer had the life in them they no longer were able to pick up a whip again they no longer could grab them and ravish them they no longer could take them under their control they lost their power hallelujah they lost all power to do it no wonder when miriam saw that one that had striped her and beat her and had come against her she grabbed the tambourine she said this is more than i can take my enemy is dead oh hallelujah when you see your enemy dead it'll put a shout in you it'll put a rejoicing in your heart that one that tormented me he don't have power over me no longer that one that come against me night after night after night has lost hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord amen i want you to understand in second timothy 3 and verse 1 it says it like this there's no also that in the last days perilous times shall come are we there we're there in perilous times demons on every hand spirits of every kind manifesting out there in the streets manifested everywhere perilous times but he says in the last days perilous times shall come last days for who i want you to understand what was meant for your destruction god is turning for your good satan is lost he is now under the feet of young people he's now under the feet of young women and young men he's under their dominion amen he has lost his power i want you to understand anxiety has come to his last service fear has come to his last service lust has come to his last service suicide has come to his last service i say satan turn them loose and let them go he's going to hold you in your private times and tell you to go take some gun or some knife and slit yourself he has lost the battle tonight he's exposed and that devil has come to this place to die [Applause] anxiety has come to this place to die fear has come here to die lust has come here to die pornography has come here to die [Applause] i say say to turn them loose you can't hold god's children no more there's a message there's a jubilee trumpet that is sounding every slave can throw their hoe down and go home free you don't have to go back home a slave you don't have to go home bound you don't have to go home with that same spirit on you there's a trumpet that's sounded and you're free you're free you're free i said you're free in jesus name there's a power here that'll resurrect your life and change it forever [Applause] pharaoh and his army had their last day philistines had their last day goliath had his last day [Applause] goliath come out on that 40th day just like any other day he got his breakfast that morning it was his last breakfast he put his shield and stuff on it was his last time he put a sword in the sheath it was the last time he was going to do that he went out there and made his challenge it was the last time [Music] mercy jesus because it was another set of ears in the camp said how dare that uncircumcised philistine challenge the armies of the living god this day he dies [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah it's time you look at your goliath and say i'm hearing the sound of a going i'm here the rushing mighty wind in my ears and this day devil you're dying i'm done with you i'm not going home with you i'm not getting on the bus with you i'm not getting in the car with you i'm going home with jesus come on now hey if the world can get angry at godly stuff how come the godly can't get angry at worldly stuff [Applause] and say i'm tired of that thing holding me i'm done with it [Applause] haman had his last day he'd made threat after threat after threat but there had been a woman that was raised into a kingdom for such a time brought to such a place for such a time hello somebody heyman's out there and he's after you he's been building gallows for you he got something built for you when you get home oh my my my he said he got something built he's thinking in his mind i'm gonna make it do this way and i'm gonna i'm expecting this to come i love it when the lord cancels the devil's plans it was a lot of you the devil expected you to be a whole lot different he expected you to be druggies and alcohols and prostitutes on the street he expected you to do all kinds of things but there was another voice there was another power there was another expert the spirit that'll come over your life and say devil this ain't yours this one don't belong to you you take your hands off of that one you take your hands off of that one that was mine [Applause] glory to god in the highest and that voice that has claimed you is the final voice the devil can scream he can holler he can protest but when god speaks and says your mind your mind your mind you never belong to the devil that's his line that's his words but my word says you're my son you're my daughter you're mine i love it and that book of esther is reading it today the king couldn't get no sleep he said bring that book of remembrance and he brought that book of remembrance and that book was opened and when that book was open there was a name revealed in there what mordecai had done he said what's been done to this man don't you realize what has happened in this generation there's been a book that's come open it's and then there's found names found names that are are inheritors of eternal life the devil didn't want that book open he didn't want it open because when he knew that book came open and you saw your name in there he didn't have enough power he didn't have enough racing power he didn't have enough sin he didn't have enough anxiety fear doubt depression suicide nothing to take your name off of that book he knew when it came open he lost well glory to god and that is exactly what happened it showed who he was it showed his heart it showed everything about him [Applause] and it changed the devil's expectations he come and expected to be exalted he said no go put the what would you do god get the finest row i get the king's robe and i'd get the king's horse and i would get it all together and i'd put this man on it good go do that to mordecai what and he had to lead him down the street the one he hated showing he'd lost power and haman began to relay her message to esther his message to esther and said go tell the king go tell him what wicked haman has done go tell him go go go go to him you've been called for such a time as this young people you've been called to this hour god didn't by accident put you here he gonna put you in any times any time slot throughout history but he chose to put you here and he has a reason and a purpose for it and there is a woman on the earth who has the ability to go into the king's chamber and say king look what old haman's doing look what he's doing to the people of god down in johnson city and over over in other countries around the world and spirit look what he's doing to my family god look what is going on in my sister's life look what's going on in my dad's mom's life okay go tell the king tell him what's going on the king has a word for that and haman had built uh gallows for amen mordecai and esther's destruction and god changed his expectations he'd built he'd built laodicea satan's eating such a way he thought for sure i'm going to destroy them and the next thing you know what happened heyman found himself swinging from his own gallows and he had his last day but let me tell you about a different last day there's a little girl out in the west there was a man over in the east wanted a wife he said i'm gonna go out to west and i'm gonna find me a wife and he goes out you know with the story the rancher out there that was over the ranch and things for the man and the man that was coming the sun and over the over the father's estate the overseer he's out there with his daughters and he hears about this coming so he gets them all dressed up and all ready and have a big ball and a big dance and they got the prettiest dresses on they sing the prettiest songs they they do it just prim and proper and perfect don't get out of order everything's perfect 30 minutes long service 15 minute preaching a few more songs after service dismissed i'm glad to be they've done everything perfect right to the letter he comes there and he says man this wasn't what i was expecting this wasn't what i was looking for he goes outside to get him a fresh breath of breath of air he's standing there looking out out at the stars and saying well really why did i come there and all of a sudden here's a creek in the door and out the creek of this door comes this ragged little girl and she's carrying a pan of dishwater and she's going down to a fence and she pours it over the fence and he's watching her he's watching her next day she comes out the fence and he's watching her next day you know seven days she'd come out he's watching her and he begins to talk to her begins to express her heart his heart to her asked her who she was brother said she was one of them castaways didn't think much about her just put off in the corner thought she was a bit too fanatical or something she's over there doing doing the work of the king of the other boss others out frilling around and partying she's out there doing the work of it and they're looking at her terribly that their nose down their nose he begins to tell her you're the one i came for and i want you to know when this happens a certain certain time i'm coming back for you and she believed him she believed the words that she heard she said he's coming back he promised me and she begins to make herself ready she begins to get the goods together to make a dress and do everything she could and it came down to the last moments and the last times until that last time she took that dishwater out that was the last day the last time she would sweep the floor the last time that she would do any chores around the house and she'd slip there and she'd get that gown on and she'd go out and stand by the roadside it was the last day come on church we don't know what that day is but we're coming to the last month last year last month last day last hour last minute last second and one of these days it'll be the last day you ever get out of bed and you're feeling all creaky and old and wore down or or you go to bed with behind battles or you get up with mind battles it'll be the last day of a mind battle it'll be the last day of anxiety it'll be the last day of fear and unbelief it'll be the last day of covet and cancer and high blood pressure and sugar diabetes and every kind of disease of satan they are coming to their last days [Applause] do you believe it let's turn to acts chapter 2 and verse 5. peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church of god for him and when herod would have been would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold the angel of the lord came unto him and a light shined in the prison and he smotes peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands and the angel said in them gird thyself and bind up those sandals and so he did and saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me and he went out and followed him and was not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision but when they were past the first and the second ward and they came to the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and fought with the angel departed apart from him and when peter was come to himself he said now i'll know assuredly that the lord has sent the angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the what expectation of the people of the jews the devil's expectations was changed many of you he's trying to put every kind of sin in your life every kind of thing on your phones every kind of spirit in your hearts every kind of defilement and every kind of thing and spirits of anxieties and fears and things you don't think you can overcome amen but all of a sudden you're sitting in a prison no more and you seem to be bound but you don't realize back at home there's a whole whole household of people that are praying for you there's churches that are praying for you there's homes that are praying for you there's there's parents that are praying for you there's pastors that are praying for you and god will come right down in your prison and say boy get up and he'll take you past the first gate sanctificate justification pass the second game sanctification pass of god the gate of iron the holy ghost and set you free [Applause] that is what he's here to do there is an angel here that's here to smote you on the side and say it's time for you to quit sitting in that prison i got power over the prison i got power over the one sitting next to you i got power over the devil that's trying to hold you i say satan loose them and let them go you don't have to be bowed one moment longer you don't have to serve the devil one moment five more minutes with the devil's too much i say tonight throw that hoe down throw that thing down and spin tormenting here and say devil i'm not going home with it i'm not picking it back up i'm not holding one more rotators i'm not going down one more your rose [Applause] hallelujah he expected you would quit he expected you would be lost he expected that you would have no hope but an angel came and the devil's plans for you were canceled they were changed for eternity when the angel drops into the room the devil's voice is over oh praise the name of the lord i can think of another man and got real sick one day and they called for jesus to come and pray for him and jesus seemed like he went another way he did he went exactly the opposite way it's easy to feel that sometimes you know when you're going through things in life you're calling out to his name you're crying you're saying lord move lord move just seems like he keeps going but he has a plan but daryl ward helped me a lot with this situation with my mom he said you know what he said he was in the military so he said you know we had military life and military training he said there was general orders that were given and every day you carried out those general orders and he said the only thing that changed the general orders of the army or the navy was for a commanding officer to step in the room and say today we're doing this and he said you couldn't argue with it you couldn't fuss with it you saluted him you said yes sir he said brother timothy y'all have been carrying out the general orders they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he's the lord god that heals all our diseases he said you've been walking in faith he said but today command an officer stepped in the room he said this is the plan and i said i salute him because he's got power over my life i'll carry out his plans they shall lay hands on the sick i ain't never said i said brother brown said i've seen where he put it in i ain't seen where he took it out altar calls prayer lines everything that god has for god's people any kind of way he wants to move i want to let him move he's the commanding officer i'm not but i will carry out to the very end whatever he says but here's this man going down down until he dies and they put him in a tomb and jesus is walking the other way four days his disciples are questioning and wondering what in the world is going on we we've seen you do so many mighty miracle things and you mean you're going to let your friend die he said he's not dead he sleeps the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of man my son of god might be glorified thereby i love that how he talked about you know the blind man and john there that was born blind and the disciples asked was this man born blind because his mom and dad sinned or because of his sin he said no he said so that the glory of god might be revealed in him you're not going through things because you've done something you're going through things so god can prove who he is and here he comes scripture verse 5 says in jesus love martha this is john 11 verse 5 and her sister in lazarus when he heard therefore he was sick he abode two days to the same place where he was and after they say let us go on to judea master the jews saw blake sought to stone thee goes there there again and he just keeps on moving and keeps on going he says our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him and the disciples said lord if he sleeps he shall do well how jesus spake of his death but they thought he spoke of him taking a rest and sleep then jesus said to them plainly lazarus is dead and i'm glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him and then said thomas let us also go that we may die with him then when jesus came he found that he had laying in the grave four days already now bethany was nine to jerusalem going down to martha as soon as she heard jesus was coming went and met him but mary set still in the house then said mary martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother would not have died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it to thee jesus said unto her thy brothers shall rise again martha said i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am i am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth now this she said yeah lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god we shall come into the world and when she had so said she went away and called mary and said the master is come and calleth for thee and as soon as she heard that she rose and came unto him and jesus was not yet coming to town but in the place where martha met him and the jews which were with her in the house comfort her and said when they saw mary and she rose up hastily and went out and followed her saying she'd go with them to the grave to weep there then when mary come to jesus she fell down on his feet saying lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but when jesus therefore saw him weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit it was troubled and said where have you laid him and they said lord come and see and jesus wept then said the jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could this man which opened the eyes of the blind caused even this man should not have died jesus therefore again groaning himself coming to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it and jesus said take away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead saying to him lord by the time he stinketh for he had been dead for days jesus said unto her said not unto thee that if i would have believed i should have see the glory of god and they took away the stone and the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me and i know that thou hears me always but because of this people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and here's a cold dead stiff man been laying there four days but he heard the voice of the resurrection [Music] in other words he heard a voice greater than death and when that voice called unto him death could no longer hold him oh hallelujah amen i want you to understand he was showing that he could overcome the chief of the tribe of demons the chief of the tribe of demons and when the chief falls everything under him false [Music] we know that when he went to that maniac come up on the platform brother branham and you know the story and that man was i said i'll hit you and he said over my feet you'll fall and he rared back hocked the spit and spitting brother man's face ran back to hit him and he before he could he just fell over his feet and the police come up and said is he delivered he said no he's not delivered he said he worships that thing but would you get him off my feet and he said he took him off rolled him off his feet and he went back to the pulpit and he said now as i was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen all of a sudden a man in a wheelchair popped out of his seat this one popped off a cot that way he said in just about five minutes time every person in
