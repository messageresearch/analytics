TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen I wonder this morning I mean just before we go to the word in prayer uh uh the word here to read let's just speak to the Lord in prayer father we bow our hearts this morning Lord and and Lord just before we read your word we'd like to speak to the author of it Lord and and we'd like to invite you into this platform today Lord the things that you have dealt with our heart on Lord in private and the things things that we have talked over as we read your word but I pray this morning that Lord that you would come by this way and Lord it be more than just a Sunday morning service a gathering of people but Lord may it be a fellowship with you and your deity Lord your great nature your character would come Among Us Lord you would move our hearts in the right directions you would fill our minds with your thoughts and your love and your word Lord we pray this morning Lord that we we have your word Lord but we desire your spirit on it Lord we desire it Lord the way you said it and the way you intend for it to be Lord now father as we come here this morning we ask you that you would just bless this meeting that you would use it for its intended purpose father now we commit this in thy faithful hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen if you got your Bibles today we'd like to just turn into the word of the Lord amen in the book of 2 Corinthians I'd like to read the 12th verse 12th chapter the first verse it's a little bit of a lengthy reading here it is not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord and I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago now whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth and such a one was caught up in the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knowth and how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter of course Paul has went beyond and seen into the Paradise in the heavens of God of such one will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in my infirmities for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and L I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I sought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness and most gladly therefore whether I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me may God bless his word as you could be seated this morning I'd like to uh just take a few minutes in this and speak to you on a special Grace a special Grace um Josh was preaching there brother Josh was preaching last Sunday morning he said something was very powerful he was talking about the change of life and he was talking about the change of seasons and he talked about a a lady and he talks about how that she goes through certain changes and he says and he kind of paraphrases brother brandom he don't say it exactly but he says in that season he said that's when you show a special kind of Grace and it just struck my heart very strongly amen that in the time of change that's when it takes a special kind of Grace amen and I I just want to speak from that a special kind of Grace uh Paul is speaking here when the Lord told him my grace is sufficient for thee that my strength is made perfect in weakness can I uh if you'll bear with me and give me some Grace I'm going to read you something from the Amplified Bible here concerning this he said should I desire to boast I shall not whis bragger for I shall be speaking the truth but abstain from it so that no May from a higher estimate of me than is Justified what see sees in me or hears me and to keep me from being puffed up and too much elated by the exceeding greatness and preeminence of the revelations which has given me a thorn or a splinter in my flesh a messenger of Satan to rack and Buffet me and harass me and to keep me from being excessively exalted three times he said I called upon the Lord and besought and begged that it might depart from me but he said to me my grace my favor and loving kindness and mercy is enough for you sufficient again any danger and enables you to hear to Bear the trouble manfully I like that amen a Grace that lets you bear trouble manfully my strength and my power are made perfect fulfilled and completed and show themselves most effective in your weakness therefore I will more gladly glory in my weakness and my infirmities that the strength and the power of Christ the Messiah May rest yes that that he may pitch his tent over me and that he may dwell upon me I like that in the Greek daglock it actually says this that the power of the anointed May abide on me I don't know about you but I want him to pitch his tent on me amen and abide in me and use me but you see it's in our weaknesses is when he and his power is most evident amen because it's something that's beyond amen uh it's beyond what man can do it's beyond the limitation of man and it has to be the sufficiency of his grace amen the prophet of God says this that that that that Christians of course are not promised a flower bed of ease but they are promised a Grace that is sufficient for every need that they have I thank God for that this morning don't you that every need we have there is a sufficient Grace amen you see brother bam says it like this God promised to go through life any believer to walk without troubles never promised that but he did promise a Grace sufficient to take care of every trouble amen and the Holy Spirit brother B says it like this God has not promised a flowery bed of EAS but has promised Grace sufficient for every trial that can hit you indeed grace is sufficient not on a flower not on a flowery bed but he promised Grace to overcome in every Temptation that's the kind of Grace he's talking about and brother explains this because of apostle Paul had had this uh happen to him and writes about it here in Corinthians he says now Paul said it like this brother Ram said there was about 10 or 15 of them with Paul he said but he was the only one of them that saw that light he said and some people can see things when others don't see Paul saw the light in so much that it blinded him amen and for several days and such reality later on we see letters he wrote and he said his eyes bothered him and he wrote of great big letters seeing that I have written to you in large letters he could hardly see he was in jail and asked the Lord to heal him and consulted him three times but what did the Lord say my grace is sufficient Paul Paul then said I will glory in my infirmity because he said except that I would be exalted above the abundance of Revelation was given a messenger of the devil a thorn in my flesh to Buffet me he'd better uh be for a while then it would he would get better and then it would go away and then it would come back and he said it would Buffet him it was like a blow after a blow like a ship on a sea you know waves blow after blow he said he would get better and then he'd have it again and then he'd get better and then he'd have it again and he'd say Lord what's the matter with me don't why don't you take this from me and he would say my grace is sufficient amen and brother B says see we got to just keep on Amen the grace is sufficient amen I I say this and brother Ram explains this so powerfully in the message Shalom he said I then shall glory in my infirmity I know you're the Healer Lord I've seen you heal the sick can you imagine Paul now suffering his own self I've seen you heal the sick Lord I've seen you as a Healer I've seen you raise the dead I've seen you cast Devils out I've seen you open the eyes of the blind but I have consulted you and you tell me it's your grace is sufficient brother BR said then this devil that bothers me is The Growing Pains of his grace this devil that bothers me is The Growing Pains of his grace amen amen I I want to read I want to say that again so we all on the same page the devil that bothers you is The Growing Pains of your grace amen the devil that bothers that's the thing see amen you you you said brother man says he allowed that devil to attack Paul he said to keep him in a place of pray to keep him in that place of humility now Paul himself is not a false Apostle and a false Apostle someone who was coming along trying to make something of himself would have never revealed his weaknesses to the people he would have never told them of his trials and of his weaknesses because the first time that religious people hear that there's a trial or a Temptation or a sickness of course there's something wrong or there's some weakness in that man or something but Paul on the other hand used used his weaknesses as a credential amen that he would suffer for Christ then Paul didn't brag on his Supernatural side he bragged on the weakness side he told you of the infirmities of his life so that he could tell you I will then glory in my infirmities I will if I'm going to brag to you I'm going to brag to you about the things that I have suffered for the cause of Christ amen and I've not give up yet amen Paul is still writing and Paul is still preaching and the devil has told everything that he has at Paul but Paul is not giving up he's saying look if I'm going to boast to you I'm going to boast to you about the infirmities that I have and what I have went through 2 Corinthians 11 says it like this I have needs of Glory if I must needs Glory I will glory in the things that concern my infirmities amen I love it can I use another version new international if I boast I'll boast of the things that shows my weakness if I'm going to boast I'll boast in show my weakness and that that's a that's a far cry from this religious world that we live in today where where no preachers can say they're sorry no more and nobody can repent in the church no more and if and and if an elder come to the to the to the altar well God forbid there's something Temptation in their life or some trouble that they might need God but I think it's time to do a way with religiosity and traditions of man that prevent men from coming to Christ when they have needs of Christ when they desire Christ amen and the day that we get too big amen to be able to apologize for wrongs or weaknesses in our lives amen is the day that Satan has cut us off from the grace and the help that God has designed for every one of us setting in here today I thank God Amen that we had a pattern like Apostle Paul because this is the very pattern that Willam Brandon followed when he talked about his weaknesses and his struggles and I've had people who were critics of brother random said how do y'all follow a man that was so depressed wanted to take his life at times how do youall follow a man that could lie to the tax amen and and evade being able to talk to the tax man how can y'all follow somebody like that I said because every one of them has troubles but he was the only one transparent about the trouble amen and I would rather know that the man we're following in this age had weaknesses but he knew how to teach the church when you're weak that's when you become strong because you're going to allow God to come on the inside and deal with your life listen friends we have got to religious we have got to the place where we don't don't feel Liberty to say I need help amen pride has shut the door on forgiveness pride has shut the door on repentances of people who living in agony this morning struggling against strongholds in their lives but they're afraid of what somebody's going to think or what somebody's going to say listen I don't care what anybody says I don't care what anybody thinks I want to live free I want to live forgiven I want to live healed I want to live saved I want to live with the power of God in my life and there is times that we must admit the weaknesses and the struggles to know that Christ could pitch his tent Upon Us my goodness Apostle Paul was a very powerful man amen who who was saying that if I'm going to boast I'm going to boast in my weakness that Christ might be glorified because Paul was not trying to sell himself he was trying to sell the messiahship of Christ that can help every man I do appreciate the spirit in our senior pastor here brother Ray because it might have been some of the first times I ever really seen a man admit a weakness or repent or say hey folks I don't have all the answers and I appreciate it because you know what I recognize the spirit of Jesus Christ the spirit of humility is the spirit of Jesus Christ do you see Paul said this therefore my son be strong be strong in the grace that is in Jesus Christ if you're going to be strong now be strong in the grace that is in Jesus Christ that thou has heard me among many witnesses the same commit thou Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ he wouldn't have told Timothy how Amen to endure hardness L hardness was coming but he was preparing him for hardness because he knew hardness was coming and that he would have to endure it as a soldier amen and I believe this morning that we Are Soldiers I like that uh I like that little little song there s Sister Mary she's and all these little kids cuz once a while we get Eevee down there and some of the kids will be in the in the living room and we'll get them singing Sunday school songs and we get them singing they they like that one I'm in the Lord's army amen I'm in the Lord's army they know it man they know that song at a four-year-old they're in the Lord's army now they don't shoot missiles they Don't Ride Calvary but they're in the Lord's army and I believe God's looking for soldiers come on church amen sometimes we get a hang nail and we want to resign from the battle some little struggle come we want to resign from the battle we'll we'll just pull back because we got our nail clipped or somebody Ste on our toe amen listen God's looking for soldiers this morning amen people that is able Amen to face the battles of this life and understand that God saved me he didn't save me for a day he didn't save me for a moment he saved me for Time and Eternity and he sealed me knowing I was going to go through struggles and battles and ups and downs and ins and outs amen this is Christian walk is not a fiery bed of ease and he would have sealed you he would have never said it that he sealed you to the day of redemption unless it was a reason to put a fast seal on you where later Jude was saying that God has kept me from failing he has kept me by the power of God listen I'll tell you this amen when you brother Ram talks about the sealing of that rail car he said that that that was sealed because it had a journey and this Christian walk is a journey it's not a Sprint it's not the 40 yard dash amen this is a journey and the day you become a Christian it begins and it don't end till you cross into that Immortal Life and God has given us a Grace this morning that is good from the very moment that we have accepted him until the time that we cross the finish line I'm glad to know that he knew what he was doing when he gave us his seal upon this life in Hebrews chapter 4 the Bible said he is a high priest he said we don't have one that cannot be touched but the feeling of the infirmities but he was in all points tempted like we are without sin I love this verse let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need isn't that powerful to find Grace in the time of need help in the time of need I know sometimes it's so hard for us to admit that we need help we've been we've been serving the lord all these years so L sometimes you need help sometimes you got to just get rid of all the religion and say God help me I don't even know how to ask for what I need but I know I need something brother Tom sometimes you can go to places in prayer where you don't know how to even talk anymore but there's an Angelic language that takes over the tongue and there's an intercessor prayer and you begin to tell God what you need and he's answering back because you don't know how to explain it sometime people say well there's something wrong with me and I ask him what's wrong they said I don't know I just need help just need help come on that woman woman at sishan Watch What She Done Jesus unlocked a truth to her that changed her both dispensation and dimensionally when she looked at him and she said Lord amen but before she said that she actually worshiped him and the Bible said he didn't pay or no mind so we know what to do when he answers prayer but what we do when he don't answer prayer she didn't get mad and leave you know what she did the Bible said she worshiped him the more and said Lord and when that truth unlocked it unlocked the dispensation she was in and it unlocked the den dimension of healing that she was needing her body it released it to her amen because of her approach to him when she just told him she needed help sir don't get so prideful and don't forget this that he can be touched I want you to remember this you can contact God don't young people listen don't you forget this that your daddy and masas got this far CU they knew how to get a hold of God and I don't care what your age is if you need help he answers prayers he prayers you can get to a place with God Amen now we've got to the place where we pray I know we pray over our meals and we pray over one another and we say prayers and that's all good but sometimes you got to pray through sometimes amen you got to pray through you know what that means you got to pray till you break through the feeling nobody loves me nobody cares nobody wants me around nobody's accepting me I'm not in the click I'm not in the circle I what is it it's designed to isolate you from the help that you need amen but if you just begin to pray there's a place you can go that there is Grace in the time of your need if there ever was a people that need him I don't know about you but I need him I need him I need him for my walk I need him in my mornings I'm not such a good person I got to have him every day I got to have him every morning I got to start my days off with Jesus and you may be inherently a good person I'm not I needed saving altto together I needed saving was it one good thing about me I needed him then and if I needed him then God have mercy I need him this morning I need him more than I've ever needed him and I say God help us help us as a church help us as a people help us as a as a lifegiving source to this generation that we are living in now if you're gonna if you're going to pray like that and you're going to get in his anointing like that and you're going to invite his presence in like that don't be surprised when people come needing help because now he's resided in you and that mercy seat this morning is not in heaven folks that Mercy seat's in this bride and if anybody's going to show Mercy they're going to have to find it in the place Mercy can be found I know teachers went away off with that but it still remains true brother B said on the day of Pentecost that Holy Ghost came down and made the heart of man his throne and this morning amen you are the seed of mercy no wonder God sends certain individuals in your life brother kind no wonder amen God would send people amen they talk to you and sometimes they're beaten and they're broken and you say what are they doing talking to me it's because you had fellowship with a merciful god and he's trying to get you to distribute rute that Mercy to somebody else come on we want Grace for us and we want Grace in us but let Grace flow through Uso brother let it flow through US Lord he never promised a trouble-free life but he did promise Grace sufficient to take care of the trouble that come you know in the exposition of the church ages brother BR speaking of this he goes he talks about the death of Antipas and the faithful mortars and them that live their lives under death and he said we think of it of these people that it would be almost impossible to be a mortar but we dare to recall that the faith that we daily use to Triumph in Christ is the same faith that upholds the poops and the martys martyrs a supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for a supreme hour I think if there has ever been a supreme hour We're living that one if there's ever been a dark day that's this one if there ever was a time of Darkness it's the age we're in now the prophet said it's been blacked out and announced that Satan was the God of this age we're living in he is the worshiped one of this age this is Satan's Eden it has become so dark but I find that in Supreme hours is when there's given Supreme Grace you know I I think of this in James chapter 4 and verse 6 but he giveth more grace ain't you glad that's in the Bible but he giveth more grace so brother Wayne I need more he giveth more grace in a supreme hour he giveth Supreme Grace special kinds of Grace he giveth more grace and I you read the rest of this and it really brings it into Focus wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble why does he give grace to the humble because they're humble enough to realize they're insignificance their littleness their inabilities their their need for God and by doing so they approach him in a way that he can help them the day that we think that we did it on our own is the day that we find out we didn't now brother Bram invisible union he comes out and preaches Romans the 7th chapter he said well a lot of people thinks this is a marriage and divorce chapter he said but really is not it's prothetic of the end time of the marriage of the bride and bridegroom room and he said when when Mr Moody Dwight moody in Chicago read this he said he ran out into the streets and said do you know Grace and somebody said Grace who he said oh the grace of God do you know him do you know Grace I mean the grace of God not not man's Grace not that kind that they give it and take it back and there's limitations to it and and you know it's graceful up to this point you know you talked about my family you did this you said that amen Grace to that no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a prophet standing and looking to the grace of God and saying you can exhaust his Mercy but you can never yes exhaust his grace Hallelujah Lord you see grace whom brother B said it like this he said he was so thrilled to see what Grace had done separating the law he said Amazing Grace oh when I get to the other side brother Bram said I'm going to sing an Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wret like me see grace precious Grace more of Grace to know for it was by Grace you were saved and not what we could do whatever we do is not counted to us for Grace is what saves Us by Grace you are saved and it is through faith now watch what brother M will say he said said and may I add to this this woman of Grace I'll Place her in the Bible she is the elect lady oh have you ever noticed this in Revelations the 21st chapter the Bible said come and let me show you the bride the Lamb's wife now that's that's an important significance he doesn't say the Lion's wife he said the Lamb's wife and when he looks in the fifth seal and sees them crying for V he said by that I know that's not the bride because the bride would never be crying for for for vengeance she would have been crying for forgiveness because she's the bride the Lamb's wife she is the wife of the attribute of lamb come on he was the lion the tribe of Judah and his Justice would have destroyed everybody but the lamb nature overcome the line and prevailed to give Grace and we married the Lamb of God oh I'll tell you I'm married to a lamb I'm married to a graceful I can tell you this I got a checkbook and before I even ask him I know I can show grace to you I can write it out for whatever you need I can write it out I can say yes we got you covered amen because I know I know the one I married I know his nature I know his character there is no case he can't cure there is no person too low he can't save there's nobody that he cannot show Grace to because he is Sovereign Grace oh that woman Grace she's the elect lady she's the bride she's the elected uh brother Brown talks about it and he says it here he says you know he says back in 1962 and it's it's a in the message communion it's in 62204 and brother man begins this talking about astronomers excuse me he talks about astronomers and while he's talking about this he says the Indians have seen the Indian people have seen that there's some Stars lining up and he names five of them and he says and they're expecting something to happen like the Earth to blow apart he said and the Americans are laughing at them on TV for believing that and brother Bram said' now I don't believe what they're saying is going to happen but there is some significance in it and he said 'I predict it has a spiritual application and I believe it's the coming in of the issue of God that great Revelations of the word will be open during this time now that's in the spring of 1962 that he says look now there's there's Stars lining up and they're thinking it's the end of the world he said but as a prophet I'm predicting to you you that the words F to open something that you ain't seen yet now watch what's happening remember they claim three stars came together in the orbits when Jesus was born but now this is five which is Grace the number of perfection see the number of Grace Jesus see grace the number of Grace God ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace It Won't Be The Obedience of the people and then he's going to quote Isaiah the 40th chapter when the Bible says yet see what he says remember when he sends John he says your Warfare is over for the Lord had to Pardon your iniquities and you have received double for your sins and and it wasn't the people the people was not in any better shape when John came than there was hundreds of years before that but the three stars had lined up and God was giv grace to the dispensation so the word was coming into flesh which was bringing Grace despite the people that were on the earth now you said preacher what are you talking about here's a number five and here's a prophet saying it's not the Son of God it's his wife that she's going to be borned into the Earth and the word itself is going to have to birth her into its presence I'll tell you this a prophet stood there and called for a virgin bride didn't he didn't he call for a virgin bride and you showed up because a prophet put those words words into the atmosphere he was more than a theologian he was more than a preacher he was a prophet of God that didn't have his own thought but he was expressing the thoughts of God and he began to say an infant church is going to be birthed in the years of 1962 and 3 there's going to come an infant Church into the Earth she's going to be birthed what's it going to be the grace of God come on now now you you got know this enough to know that Pentecostals could fast and pray all they want to how you ever going to break them seals John was crying and said and only the lamb could take the book so who's going to take it and how are they going to manifest it and how's it going to be unless the grace of God would come because it's in the season of change there has to be a special Grace given in that hour what's the hand of Grace with Abraham and Sarah at the time of her change she laughed at the angel of the Lord and God could have killed her but he didn't take her life because she was a part of the prophecy she was a part of the very plan that God had and how could he kill her amen and not kill his own plan but God showed a special kind of Grace to Sarah amen that she might understand and believe in the season of her change and I'll say this this morning there has been a a special Grace given in this bride Church that has took you some of come on some of us has been put every which direction but right God never left you in that what if he had left us where he found us what if he had left us in some of them doctrines we got engulfed in and some of the fellowships are mind and we were so RI in them wasn't we we were so R in them amen but God rich in Mercy he came to you anyhow and he broke into your darkness and he stepped in there and said son it's not right daughter it's not right and it broke that thing off of you and then it give you Grace to come out of it it give you Grace to follow after it it's a special kind of Grace Hallelujah I'll give it to you in a more simple way you just had a real Fallout with somebody in your home or your church or something like that and you go sit down in your chair and you fold your arms so this ain't going to get fixed till they fix it and you just not all up you know I I know nobody's ever done that and I'm explaining it pretty good ain't I I'm just not going to apologize for this I didn't do it there's no sense in this that's a good old hillbilly word right there no sense but all of a sudden some almost something starts starring in your heart what if I would have treated did you this way oh my what if he would have had the impatience with me that I've had with his children but it's only in those in those sacred moments like that that you really understand what God is really trying to get to you yeah is I don't want you to read about Grace I don't want you to think about Grace I want you to give Grace to give it you had to possess it in a special way it's almost like you have to understand it's not yours to give could I say it to you like this if I walked up to you let's just say you had $100 in your pocket I said Nathaniel give Samuel $100 you go I work 10 hours for that $100 but if I just walk up and give you $100 and said hey would you hand that to Samuel you just because it's not yours you're just giving away what you have received when he give you Grace he gave it to you freely and we could go we could go very deep in this area but I'm not going to I'm just going to I'm just going to touch it in Romans the 5th chapter the Bible said that we are justified by faith didn't it we are justified by faith therefore we have peace with God Ephesians says that we are saved by grace and that is through faith yes right well let me ask you this where'd you get the faith to believe it yeah the entire concept of Christianity comes from you believe right as a as a gentile Soldier you can only receive what you can believe why is it you believe and somebody else don't believe you might you might aale that to your birth or to your raising I can't do it because I've seen people raised just like you and don't believe I've seen people raised just like you and turned it away I've seen people come from The Gutter and believe it and people come from mansions and disbelieve it so it ain't where you come from in this life but God who is rich in Mercy put a seed on the inside of you that belongs to him and the Very salvation that you have didn't belong to you to begin with you was not saved by your desire you were saved by the desire of God but you were dead in sins and trespasses unless God gave Grace you would not be here this morning so old brother Wayne soup I believed it but it's not even your faith to believe [Applause] with you how do you how do you muster the faith to believe but if you hadn't had something to believe you couldn't receive Grace but grace started Hallelujah grace started when God chose you and elected you before the foundation of the world and when you heard this beautiful message you said I believe that don't run off with your nose in the air like you've done something on your own and when somebody else don't believe God have mercy don't look down on them because God rich in Mercy gave us an opportunity and a Grace that we could stand there and say Lord we don't understand it but maybe I could conduct myself in such a way they'd be nice to me come on CU you might not believe who you are but he knows who you are do you know Grace do you know the elect lady called the Lamb's wife do you realize the Bible predicted out of Zion shall come saviors and you are in an unredeemed form coming to the Earth but you're an attribute of the savior of God and he comes down and saves you fills you with the Holy Ghost and the same one that healed the blind that saved the lepers that gave life is on inside of every person sitting in this building and though somebody may never read a Bible every time they come into contact with the bride of Christ they have contacted the god of Eternity Hallelujah now the classes that I'm talking about that elect lady brother bramy divides them in s his church age he said listen we could go a step further and let me know let you know this the purpose of God in election stands his purpose stands in election this bride who was forn and beloved before she was ever brought forth in the ages she was Redeemed by his blood and can never somebody say never and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed under her her you I got Bible for it Romans chap 4 and: 8 blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin amen blessed is he for he cannot go through judgment now there's there's other people so don't get don't don't get that mixed up now because there's another class who have their names on the land's Book of Life that'll come up in the second resurrection and they'll be judged by their deeds right because they have a book of of life and they'll be judged for from what they did that's in Matthew 25 that is where he divides them from the left and right remember there's people on the left and people on the right those people on the right they divide them as sheep and goat brother B says it's not sheep because the bride's not in that judgment she sets in judgment she's on the other side of the of the she's not on that side she's on this side of the Judgment so she's passing judgment and those that are on the right now there's there's different classes of everybody on the right there and some of them did good to people and this is theologically hard on a lot of people but some people will be there that never were born again the prophet of God said just because they had been good who are you have you considered who you are that the way somebody approaches you could determine their eternal life have you considered that tears me to pieces to know my weaknesses to know my my inner conscience and my fears and and but I say God help me I'm more than just a preacher or just a pastor or your friend I am a son of the almighty God Grace has been dispensed through this life into this Earth and people that come in contact with that life have come in contact with the grace of God do you know her missg grace I know I know that's theologically hard but I'm a Believer and I just accept the prophet as true that's part of that what Grace I was talking about I just believe him don't ask me why I do I just do now there's also another group of course that brother Bram said are borderline Christians and you saw them when you saw Judas and balum there's a fourth and a final one who never have their names on the Lamb's Book of Life of course which of them like pharaoh and they were made for this day of wickedness now brother bandam says that that this portion of the word is really hard for the human mind to Gra ASP yeah he says see it must be accepted and believed by faith some will be offended by what I have set forth and they will fail to understand the sovereignty of God which sets forth that God is good and because he is God one cannot defeat his counsel or thought or will or his purpose he is omnipotent and ruling in all Affairs look at this the reason people don't understand is because they they don't conceive the sovereignty of God right amen God is Sovereign I believe I believe without any hindrance that he sovereignly rules over the whole world then people of course say you mean God lets this happen he lets this take place he lets this take place now watch the prophet teaches us easily uh if you've ever read author pink he wrote a a sermon called the sovereignty of God brother B actually read it and then talks about it in God of this evil age amen and what he says is people say well because of all the sickness and all the evil and all the trouble has God lost control see if he's Sovereign and all of this is happening has he lost control brother R said oh no he said it's been prophesied in Scripture that LE oosa age would come and it describes the age and it described what it would be like he said but God could never lead the world into that he said so he allows the spirit of Truth and error to come into the Earth and he says the people that believe the truth will escape that but the people that believe the error will go into the cages of the unclean bird because they're following a lie and be damned by the LIE they believe but God is Sovereign so he allows Satan into these situations so when the world is full with all these troubles amen what kind of God would he be to step back his grace when he knew these kinds of times were coming folks you are living in the age of pressure there has never been more pressure on a human being than the age we're living in brother man said pressure is on it's on from the top to the bottom on rulers on leaders on religion it's on everybody come on you heard the sermon let off the pressure amen pressure is on everybody but what is it at the age of pressure he said with every Temptation there is a way of Escape at the age of pressure there's going to come a special Grace God's going to tell the whole story in your dispensation he's going to give you Revelation that has not been given to any age prior to your age he's going to give a revelation to help you understand why am I here why am I going through this and what will the outcome of what I'm happening will be men have faced these for years and didn't have the answers but when you face the trials of this age when you face the age you're living in you have had the three-fold purpose of God revealed to you in this dispensation brother Bram says it like this he says in the first seal he says them Thunders them Revelations 10 he said there're a mystery and we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it does it will give us faith for rapturing grace for the church to move out now I could preach an hour on that just just say this term and and I want you to write this one down faith for Grace faith for Grace the human mind won't be able to grasp this one it will take Faith for this kind of Grace it'll take it'll take your faith to believe God for this kind of Grace right the kind of Grace that could call you in all of your troubles brother Bon says it like this he says God knows he says now wait a minute it'll reveal in that day don't write it John because they're going to stagger over it he said but let it go I'll reveal it in the day when it needs to be done there were other ages he could have released this Revelation but they didn't have the faith to believe it they would have staggered over the realities of what we're talking about this morning but Grace has given you Faith to believe Grace oh Hallelujah in Exodus 33 and13 Moses said this I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight what's what's Moses doing he said Lord if I found Grace show me your way so he's tying together the idea of Grace and Revelation that when God gives Grace he gives Revelation that's his that's his understanding Revelation comes by Grace see when Grace really strikes your life then you understand something because it comes to you by faith or it comes by Revelation spiritual Revelations brother B tells us this he says we can be just as religious and sincere and perhaps he says as what this man was of Cain he said but the only thing that made the difference this man had a spiritual revelation of God's requirements the difference between Cain and Abel was Cain didn't have the requirements of spiritual Revelation he didn't know what God required amen do you see amen spiritual Revelation see it's it's what works by Grace see and the only way you'll ever know the difference see the my Presbyterian Lutheran Baptist the only way that you'll ever know is God has got to personally reveal himself to you you in the power of the Holy Ghost before you can know it Jesus said himself that the scripture said no man can save can call me Jesus except by the Holy Ghost see then it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal to the individual and that shows him Grace watch here in Works Faith expressed brother B said here he said I where where I want to say faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation and I want to say just a moment now it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace I've been studying the seventh seal for about a week I thought I'd be preaching on it this weekend but Lord put something different on my heart here Friday night so this is where we are but this seven seal he says this in the end of his book he says this he said now you may understand this that it's your grace to them that these things are revealed now I'm going to try to get into that seven still pretty soon and you'll see what he's talking about all of them things that happened and it's his grace to you that they're revealed do you see in in in in here in Zechariah Chapter 4 what the scriptures were were uh if you if you know of zerubabel how many knows who zerubabel is in the Bible I just see your hand so I can kind of most of the crowd knows who zerubabel was zerubabel was an Israelite in the time when Daniel and the Hebrew children were carried into Persia or Babylon then it became Persia and and zerubabel was one of the men jerub and Joshua two of them were released to go back to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple that had been tore down Solomon's Temple it had been released to do so and when this had happened in Zechariah the 4th chapter he said who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel for thou sh become a plain so when he gets ready to go back he says to him what what's the mountain between him and what I'm sending him to do now whatever that mountain is it shall become a plane you see he's telling him that what I'm sending you to do is my sovereign will and there's no mountain going to stop it there's no troubles that can prevent this from taking place then there's going to be a time of trouble there's there's things things going to happen like crazy zable he but that mountain shall become a plain and I say this to you amen when William Brandon fulfills this scripture in the end time he's rebuilding the Church of the Living God and there was some mountains of Pentecost and Baptist and Lutheran and Presbyterian and there was every kind of witch doctor and every kind of sickness and problems and even in his own life his birth to a alcoholic family with an illegitimate raising amen come up without without illiterate I mean come up literate in no understanding not through any channels any schools he had mountains before him but God intended for you to get this message and he said whatever mountain is between this messenger and them people shall become a plane and God got this message to you listen let me say this if God was God enough to get this message to you he's got enough to keep you once the message gets to you hey you think about all the things God did to get this message into your life brother L you think about all them things that God did now once he gets you there he's going to keep you there it is already written he that had begun the work he will also finish the work I tell you this he's a finisher and when this messenger comes brother R says he shall bring forth a headstone now that's the finishing piece and he will cry Grace he's going to double the grace in the bringing forth of this message it will be Grace plus religion it's going to be Grace plus my understanding it's going to be Grace plus my good raisin of my family come on Church you know I'm not against good raising we teach good raising but don't never think that that be added to Grace you can only add Grace to Grace you can only take Grace and add to Grace this message was Grace to Grace I'll tell you this amen when you when you look at it now some people maybe wouldn't agree with me here and I I I don't mind them disagreeing but this is something the Lord showed me personally in Titus Chapter 2 it says for the grace of God that bring us salvation has appeared unto all men that's J when Jesus came it appeared unto all men and he says so but we are looking in the 13th verse we are looking for that blessed hope and the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ so he knew something had come but he knew something was coming watch in First Peter chapter 1 he said wherefore go to the loins of your mind and be sober to the help of the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ the grace of God had appeared unto all men and they had for 2,000 years that Gra but there's coming another Grace there's coming a Grace that'll Rapture the church Hallelujah there's a Grace that's going to come and bring you out amen of denominational systems and troubles and situations of your lives Grace that don't have to leave nobody behind I tell you what I'm so glad to be a preacher in this age amen I'd hate to have to break out my rule book to figure out if you could come I I'd hate to have to have a rule book up here that we had to break it out amen who can come and who can be a part and can we join the church and can we be listen let me say this you can't join this church we don't even have that kind of church amen you say preacher you can't join your church no sir you got to be borned in this church cuz this ain't the church here this is a worldwide body and you got to be borned into this body Hallelujah amen you can pick your friends you can't pick your family true truth the revelation of Jesus Christ do you see what brother Bram says in the message of Grace he said see he ties himself to this ministry how many realizes that that brother BR puts himself in Zechariah 4 and said just as zerubabel was committ to rebuild that Tabernacle I have been commissioned to rebuild this church and remember in statute of the perfect man he comes along and he says not an organization I'm not building organizations I'm building individuals to be powerhouses with almighty God what's he doing he's capping off the lives of Believers with the voice of the father it's adoption folks this message is your adoption Authority Hall oh I know come on you you can try I know you can I know you can try let's push ourselves into brotherly love and let's try to climb up to charity and I'll tell you what in your Revival is all the way down there when it finally happens when it finally comes when the church finally finds her brotherly kindness and we're going to deal with your weaknesses and your character and we're going to push you and push you and push you and you know I got the answer so you all got to to follow me amen I say it's not by works it's by the grace of God and he sent this bride's Revival despite your troubles and despite your problems and despite your issues Hallelujah you ain't going to be a Revival out of this altar you're going to believe God and Grace is going to fill your life and Revival will surge through you this ain't Grace plus what you can do this is the grace of God that's right Grace Grace plus Grace that's why he says not by my but by my power saith the Lord and brother Bram actually actually ties this together and I have to slow down just a moment to say this not by might not by power but by my spirit as Zechariah 4 right sir and he says see he will cry to it when these Mysteries unfold he will cry to it Grace Grace see when these things begin to unfold he'll begin to say that it's the grace of God now brother Bram actually will come along and he's going to have some very contradictory statements for the churches but brother bandam says this after he goes beyond the the curtain watch Paul did it now brother randam does it and when he comes back he said I seen y'all over there in white robes and he had the he had the grace to ask the question I'm glad he asked it he said where did these people get those robes and the angel said by the pardoning grace of the word now this this message has placed you under Sovereign pardon power Sovereign I I got to I got to skip a big place here but I got to get to this it's Sovereign it's Sovereign power brother Bram says it like this he said see grace is old and reaches all the way back to Eden remember he said the Blackness of Eden and when they'd sinned how far they was from God he said but that's when God broke in and the grace of God offered a way out through a sacrifice that was the grace of God to Adam because he couldn't help himself so God reached down his hand and brother B said that same Grace reached into Noah's age and the Bible said and Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord that same hand reached into Moses's age that same hand reached into David's age that same hand was preacher and brother B says and what was it doing Grace was providing and making a way not for people that could help themselves but people that couldn't help themselves the grace of God see grace will make a way brother B said he'll make a way one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see God when I get over it and I get under it and I can't get around it or there's no way God opens a way right yeah somehow or another his grace is sufficient to carry us through and then brother Bram announces something in the message of Grace that is this is probably first time I've heard it all the way up through my Ministry it's one of the things that never leaves you and he announces that Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign one that Sovereign Grace comes from a sovereign one he said then Sovereign what what can it do have you ever ask yourself this morning what can we talk about Grace but what can Grace do what is the extensive power of Grace what can it do brother B says see it can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign and he gives Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful you say can I do this this or shall I do this or must I do this it doesn't do that Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the viest H how did God save him how'd God save me because he can do what he wants to do he is Sovereign brother BR said that's right then he saved a Wretch like Me it was Grace for William brandham see it's Sovereign we don't have to ask anybody and then brother Ram proves this case he's a Biblical preacher yeah then he proves his case at Calvary right and he takes the two thieves and the thief that's on the right and he said the thief on the r is in his dying moments and brother brandham really expresses this when he says in that moment there that dying Thief Rejoice to see The Rock in his day remember yeah and he says when he looked over and seen the Savior hanging there and he had the he had the faith to be able to say Lord Remember Me In Your Kingdom Remember Me Lord I need saving Lord and there's a guy hanging just on the other side of the Cross why didn't he believe who he was why did that man believe in the other amen come on now something Sovereign happened there and when the sovereignty of God broke open brother bam made an understanding and he said that thief on the right he said God had never come into his mind before that time right he had never served God until that moment and people say well there's no such thing as deathbed confessions sir well they wasn't baptized they ain't no way they could be saved boy it just tears that legal Doctrine to Pieces don't it you can't box this God up he's Sovereign he's God he can save anybody he can heal anybody the vest and the lowest but yet God can put his t on you and show his glory from you he's Sovereign hallu we serve a sovereign God now there's two things with Sovereign there's a noun and an adjective if you're talking about the noun it's the person that's Sovereign if it's an adjective it's the ACT that's Sovereign and the adjective means it means you possess a supreme ultimate power it means it's unlimited and unrestricted and Unbound and God is unrestricted and unlimited and Unbound and what that he could save because he saves because of this pardon power y y y'all know when we say the word pardon power in English do you know why you know what that means why they use the word pardon in the King James Bible it's because it comes from England the pardon the pardon that we talk about in political world which is used in your Bible comes from way back in the early 500s after Christ they can dat all the way back to a King wesex in England who used it in 16 or 688 and when he used it he called it the prerogative of Mercy a king believed he was King by Divine Right how many knows that they believed they were King by Divine there's an Englishman right there he's a king by Divine Right In other words he wasn't just King God meting King so by divine right he had a prerogative to show Mercy to whom he would show Mercy later in in 1535 King Henry VII I can't read roman numerals but it's a V and 31 so I'm thinking that's the eighth and 15th is that it it's King Henry VI eth told you I had some weakness in 1535 he then made it law that pardon power was exclusive to the crown and he titled it the act of Grace it was then that this privilege was a concession and not a right but it was the right of the king to show it to whom he would it was called The Royal prerogative of Mercy the act of Grace do you see this is the very thing that happened when George Washington become the president of the United States when he had a the first Rebellion that he had rise up was called the Whiskey Rebellion they didn't like him taxing the whiskey so they had a Whiskey Rebellion show up and George Washington pulled out the old history pardon to end a rebellion brother brother he see it was his own people that were in Rebellion people that he had fought with against the British and people that he had established a country with and they were rebelling against against him see you know what he did he pulled out a pardon power to make the enmity go away to make it where they could be American citizens again and just because they rebelled or had become enemy it would not be forever it was an act of Grace it was a prerogative of Mercy you might know this uh might be kind of amazing to know this that they actually pardoned a bunch of pirates one time they wanted to end piracy didn't work do you know Blackbeard was pardoned I didn't know that till I got to reading this but Blackbeard actually received the pardon and then later he went back to being a pirate he enjoyed the benefits of the pardon in the United States it's written in our constitution I I'll just read this to you this is just the portion of pardon the president shall have the power to Grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States except in the cases of impeachment now watch this Congress itself cannot constrain the pardon power Congress can neither limit the effect of his pardon nor exclude it from its exercise in any class of offender you know they didn't give pardon power to the Department of Justice they gave it to the executive branch y'all know why because the the part the Judgment Branch the legal Branch Justice is blind and if you break the law it's blind to who broke it it only passes judgment but in the executive branch they knew that a man would be able to discern what really happened and that Mercy would be issued from a president instead of the judicial I thought oh dear lord listen this first used by George Washington then Andrew Johnson actually used it amen and pardoned Jefferson Davis when you say Jefferson Davis is a southerner you you're supposed to put your shoulders back a little you always see them in the room they kind of set up he was the president of the Confederate states and the president of America pardoned the president of the Rebellion to end the Rebellion it actually was used by both Andrew Johnson and President Lincoln that when they tried to stop the Civil War they begin to issue blanket pardons of all Rebels anybody that would come in and pledge allegiance to the flag could walk away with a pardon power it was a blanket am mean anybody any any Rebels anybody that's broken our laws come back in and say you're sorry and take the oath to this flag and you can be a citizen again oh I'll tell you somebody somebody you know this is this is big in news right now you know because president uh uh uh Trump yeah that's his name president Trump just pardoned man he pardoned a bunch of people yeah I think it was, 1600 of them got everybody mad except those people do you know that that this is the very thing that did that Ford did when he pardoned Nixon yeah when Ford pardoned Nixon it was it was basically the end of his political career because it was so unpopular what he was doing but he was trying to bring that man and Salvage him even before judgment struck him now now there's a there's an amazing case of these all these people that's been pardoned do you know there's one of them one of the women he pardoned said she didn't want it I mean she better been thinking she said I did the crime I've did the time I don't want no pardon I don't need your help so you know the thing is brother Brandon brings it up in the message and I don't know if you've ever studied it or not but he talks about Abraham Lincoln having pardoned somebody that actually died if capital punishment now I couldn't find that specific case but now Lincoln was pardoning a lot of people and there is hundreds of documents where it's just written I I I found a bunch of them online where the the pardon was written on just a little card and it said from the executive branch or something like that and it had just a little scribble and his his signature and that was a pardon they had them things all over the country during the Civil War but there actually is case that's still on the books right now it's actually predominant law it's United States versus Wilson and it was in 1833 two men robbed a mail truck and somebody got hurt and they they judged them and it was during the time of Andrew Jackson one of the men was killed uh for his crimes and the other man uh Mr Wilson actually denied the pardon that Jackson gave him he actually said I won't want it and they went ahead and killed the man it's still in case of today Wilson refused the pardon and the Supreme Court was asked to rule upon it and the ruling still stands today it said the decision that the prisoner does not accept the pardon is not in effect a pardon this is this is direct quote from your Supreme Court a pardon is a deed to the validity of which delivery is essential and delivery is not complete without acceptance a pardon has to be delivered and it cannot only be brought it has to be received you see that's why when the message of the hour comes along brother bam meets that girl up there in Toledo and he comes back around there remember and he's judging her you heard it on tap ago and he's judging her and he said and the Lord I seen my sins going up and he said I seen somebody writing them all in a book he said and I said Lord is that my sins and he said I said Lord forgive me and he said he put his hand in his side and he wrote pardon across the book and threw it backwards and from there brother bam begin to preach on Romans 8th chapter he freely give us all things how much more has he gave us a pardon a pardon is a release from guilt can you see that man used it to stop the Rebellion man used it to stop the war and that's exactly what God used his pardon power for for we that were Rebels for we that were enemies unto God he put out a blanket pardon to whosoever will let him come to the Waters of Life freely and let him ask and let him drink Amen to whosoever can come amen there's a pardon laying there this morning even so much when the great power of judgment Begin to Fall upon the age you know I'm just going to I'm just going to ask you do you have that picture of the cloud brother Bram brings you you've seen that picture you've seen it hundreds of times and you looked at it every which way but in 1963 when that cloud came down there and had his picture taken somewhere there between Tucson and Flagstaff it's not something just to be made fun of or mimicked or somebody to act like that it wasn't something important but the prophet of God said it was our Lord up there and he said that white ring around his face you're looking at was the white was the seven angels of God forming his wig which told that he is the Supreme judge of Heaven and Earth The Sovereign one showed up in this this age right and you know what he did Brother Bram looked at that picture and he said but I want you in the middle of all of this great Revelation yeah he said but I want you to notice if you get a picture sometime look at it he said he's looking to the rightall where he on the cross pardoned The Sinner and here it is this morning being exercised listen the message has been delivered the pardon has came but it's not complete till it's received you might want to get down there this morning if our musicians would come you might want to you might want to take out your old pardon paper and look it over again somebody said brother Wayne what's our pardon brother R said John 3:16 he said that was your pardon he said because watch the next verse he that believeth not is condemned already therefore being justified by faith brother John where did you get your faith so well brother Wayne you know I just believe God there's you know I I've did all this and I've worked all this and I've just did this do you know your Bible says in John 6 that no man cometh unto me unless I first draw him it would be amazing if you look up that word in the Greek draw because you can use it a bunch of different ways in the English but in the Greek it literally means to be drug off it don't mean to draw it means to drag it means that God came down and by an inward work of Grace in your life made you believe something had you believe something gave you the grace to believe something that would take you out of every bit of the situations you're in you talk about the grace of God a special kind of Grace a special kind of Grace I wonder this morning you you you you say preacher what are you getting at well look at the grace of God look at the pardons that he gave down Through the Ages but the one took the cake for me was that President Biden just minutes left in his in his term and he starts passing out what they call preemptive pardons yes you mean these folks ain't even been charged yet and you're going to Pardon them if that's true in the negative realm you got to think about what God has done for you there is a preemptive pardon over your life and he's told the devil no matter what you dig up on them no matter what you charge them for no matter the dirt you get no matter how much you focus on them I have preemptively pardon them and there's nothing you can do with them tell that devil this morning I am justified by my faith I believe it I receive it it's a pardon power stand to your feet with me this morning you preemptively pardoned you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you
