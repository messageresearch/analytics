[10:55] in the greatest display of the
[10:59] omnipotence of the Lord was done in our
[11:02] age there's been more done in the

[11:13] years after the death burial and
[11:15] resurrection of Jesus

[13:52] you this morning and I'd like to invite
[13:55] you to the scripture with me in the Book
[13:56] of Luke uh I want like to go in the
[13:59] first chapter of the Book of Luke uh
[14:01] chap 1: 26 down to 31 uh to you that was
[14:05] here Thursday night forgive me uh we
[14:07] were planning on being in a series this
[14:09] weekend and I just uh the Lord just
[14:12] really spoke something to me on Friday
[14:15] night and and change my entire Direction
[14:17] so you just bear with me and and uh and
[14:20] I just want to speak from here if I can
[14:22] this morning Luke chapter 1 verse 26 and
[14:25] I think it's down to verse 31
[14:30] and in the sixth month the angel of
[14:32] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[14:35] Galilee named
[14:38] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[14:41] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[14:44] David and the virgin's name was Mary and
[14:48] the angel came in unto her and said
[14:52] hail Thou Art highly favored and the
[14:55] Lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[15:00] women and when she had saw him she was
[15:03] troubled at this saying and Cas in her
[15:06] mind what manner of salutation this
[15:09] should be and the angel said unto her
[15:12] fear not Mary for thou has found favor
[15:15] with
[15:16] God and behold Thou shalt conceive in
[15:19] thy womb and bring forth a son thou sht
[15:23] call his name
[15:25] Jesus I have just a little bit further
[15:28] hang on here let me
[15:31] yeah we're going to verse 38 and he
[15:34] shall be great and shall be called the
[15:35] son of the highest and the Lord God
[15:38] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[15:40] father David and he shall reign over the
[15:43] house of Jacob forever and of his
[15:44] kingdom there shall be no end you know
[15:46] that's all scripture Prophecy of the
[15:48] Messiah then shall Mary then said Mary
[15:51] unto the
[15:52] angel how shall this
[15:55] be seeing I know not a man now
[15:59] she's questioning the
[16:01] angel
[16:03] inquiring but this is not a question of
[16:05] doubt this is a question how's this
[16:07] going to
[16:09] happen and look what she says seeing
[16:11] that I don't know a man and the angel
[16:12] answered her and said unto her the Holy
[16:16] Ghost shall come upon
[16:18] thee now that is an answer that the
[16:21] world's not really prepared to take
[16:24] today but that's the answer the angel
[16:27] gave to Mary
[16:29] when you need something impossible how
[16:31] shall it happen the Holy Ghost shall
[16:35] come upon thee and the power of the
[16:37] highest shall overshadow thee and
[16:40] therefore also the holy thing which
[16:42] shall be born to thee shall be called
[16:44] The Son of God and behold thy cousin
[16:47] Elizabeth she also conceived in her old
[16:50] age and this is the sixth month with her
[16:53] who was called Baron for with God
[16:56] nothing shall be impossible ible and
[17:00] Mary said behold the handmade of the
[17:02] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[17:06] in the angel departed from her God bless
[17:09] you as may be seated this morning I want
[17:11] to speak to you on this uh subject this
[17:14] morning and if I would take a title I
[17:16] want to talk to you about the God of
[17:19] miracles about the God of
[17:23] Miracles for with God nothing shall be
[17:28] imp possible you know I was just uh I
[17:31] was just talking to my my father-in-law
[17:33] God bless you brother ver it's good to
[17:35] have him here this morning and sister
[17:36] Dei and we were coming along the road
[17:39] the other night him and I just had a
[17:40] little time together in the car and we
[17:41] were just speaking and uh we were
[17:44] discussing the situation he said brother
[17:45] Wayne said really what we need is a
[17:48] miracle and I said that's right brother
[17:50] Vernon we could we need a miracle and we
[17:53] were just talking along like that and
[17:54] then later that evening I was in my
[17:56] truck by myself a little while and I was
[17:58] just medit meditating on that we need a
[18:00] miracle and I was just meditating on the
[18:02] idea of of Miracles and uh and uh the
[18:06] presence of God and how it works and I
[18:09] was just meditating that way on Miracles
[18:11] and while I was meditating like that all
[18:13] of a sudden there was a presence just
[18:15] come in my truck and just it's just
[18:17] almost like something that would just
[18:19] vibrate the the presence of God just
[18:21] came so strong and he spoke to me and
[18:24] told me that he still is the god of
[18:27] Miracles and I I think it's I think it's
[18:30] a reality this morning uh that we that
[18:33] we realize that God has not changed now
[18:38] I know that things have changed and
[18:39] times have changed and maybe some of
[18:41] your circumstances have changed but I
[18:44] want to assure you this morning that
[18:46] there's one thing that hasn't changed
[18:48] and that's the god you
[18:50] serve brother bradam will tell us this
[18:52] he'll tell us that this is what happens
[18:55] uh with Mary here in the scripture when
[18:58] she was walking along the way he's so
[19:00] detailed and he said he said I'll tell
[19:02] you what let's do he said let's take a
[19:03] seat beside the road and let's see what
[19:05] happens and he said I see this little
[19:07] girl he said she's about 18 years old
[19:09] and she's coming down the path and he
[19:11] says this is a this is on about a Monday
[19:14] morning and and of course it probably
[19:16] was a Sunday morning then but it's on a
[19:18] Monday morning to us and he said it was
[19:21] on a Monday morning and he said they had
[19:22] just been over to uh they had just been
[19:24] over the day before to the synagogue and
[19:26] they had heard A good sermon that her
[19:28] and her her
[19:30] uh was a husband but it was an espoused
[19:33] husband and it was Joseph and they had
[19:35] been to the meeting and brother Bram
[19:37] said they had heard a tremendous sermon
[19:38] from the from the man of God and he had
[19:40] talked about the God of history and what
[19:43] he had done and all the wonderful things
[19:45] that God had done and when when he began
[19:47] to talk about it she said uh brother
[19:49] Braham says and Joseph and Mary
[19:51] discussed it and got to thinking about
[19:53] well that's that's wonderful but uh but
[19:56] the but the preacher ruined it when he
[19:57] said I wish God still done those things
[20:00] today and you know he says and that's
[20:03] exactly the thing that the the Pharisees
[20:06] could look in the scripture and they
[20:07] could see what God was and what he did
[20:10] but rather when it began to come to this
[20:13] generation he said that's what they
[20:14] would do is put it off to some other day
[20:17] and he says now what happened here is
[20:19] Mary was going along the road and she
[20:23] was thinking on that
[20:24] scripture of how that the Bible says
[20:27] unto us a child is born and a son is
[20:30] given and his name Shall be Called
[20:32] counselor and Prince of Peace of the
[20:33] Mighty God he said she became so
[20:35] interested in that scripture amen that
[20:38] she almost forgot where she was going
[20:40] and started to miss the corner when she
[20:42] noticed a bright light in front of her
[20:45] she thought maybe that it was the sun
[20:46] shining or something like that she said
[20:48] but it was the angel Gabriel that was
[20:49] standing right in her path now sometimes
[20:51] you read about encounters with angels
[20:53] and you think that it's supposed to be
[20:55] some special person or something but
[20:56] this is a 18-year-old girl on her way to
[21:00] do laundry brother Ram told us what she
[21:02] was actually doing she had a a jug on
[21:04] her head and was going down to the whale
[21:06] and she was going to draw some water and
[21:08] do the washing amen now because God
[21:11] interacts with man not just at church
[21:14] but God will come right to you in your
[21:17] normal day right in the middle of you
[21:19] doing your dishes or you cleaning your
[21:22] floor or you're laying your bricks or
[21:24] you're putting up the rafters on the on
[21:26] the thing or you're just driving down
[21:28] the road as a as a Salesman or in a car
[21:31] I think sometimes God must drive these
[21:33] cars cuz I don't know brother JP I've
[21:35] had that anointing hit me in my eyes are
[21:37] full of tears that I couldn't even see
[21:39] to go nowhere and amen you know all
[21:41] those years on the road and I never had
[21:43] any accidents and I don't know how many
[21:45] times I drove down the road my hands up
[21:46] in the air and praising the Lord but you
[21:49] know uh God just encounters right in the
[21:51] middle of even your normal day but the
[21:54] thing about the story that I love so
[21:57] much is brother Bram says she was
[21:59] meditating on that scripture when that
[22:02] angel encountered her amen and I think
[22:04] it's pretty powerful that when when she
[22:06] encountered him amen that's what she was
[22:09] thinking about and brother bam takes it
[22:10] and he says it like this I think it's
[22:12] too bad that the church today doesn't
[22:15] walk in the spirit a more a little more
[22:16] like that he said it's a kind of time
[22:20] when God comes to you he said just like
[22:22] it was when the on the road to emus when
[22:24] cleopas and his friends see they were
[22:27] thinking about Jesus when when he
[22:28] stepped out of the bushes and that's
[22:30] when he came to him uh brother bam will
[22:32] take it a little further and he'll say
[22:34] it was about 2 weeks ago he says I was
[22:37] or three he said I was sitting down by a
[22:39] sycamore tree and I was just telling and
[22:42] began to think and I was thinking about
[22:44] the first time that he declared the new
[22:46] ministry to me and I was starting to
[22:48] draw on that and that's when when he be
[22:51] to come to me now now to think about
[22:54] amen sometimes we get it in our mind
[22:57] that there's got to be some great event
[22:59] there has to be a camp meeting or there
[23:01] has to be a special thing happen you
[23:04] know before God but brother R says he's
[23:07] sitting here next to a sycamore tree and
[23:09] and Mary was walking to the whale and
[23:12] sometimes it's just a man in a room
[23:14] praying or someone going down the road
[23:16] but it's not exactly where you are but
[23:19] more so what you're meditating on of
[23:22] whether it is what comes to you and
[23:25] brother man said of course I'd like to
[23:27] see it where the church would dwell more
[23:28] like that you know in Romans the 8th
[23:30] chapter the Bible said that there is now
[23:33] no condemnation to them which are in
[23:35] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[23:38] flesh but after the
[23:40] spirit now there's one thing that I
[23:43] found out that we are are men and
[23:45] brother bam says it very clearly that we
[23:47] were never we were never angels and
[23:49] we're never going to be angels that we
[23:51] always are men and we're ever going to
[23:53] be men and and the thing about the grace
[23:56] of God that has saved you is that that
[23:58] God needed somebody to save to have a
[24:01] reason and purpose of being so therefore
[24:04] we're not looking at that you're a
[24:06] perfect person that's not the view
[24:08] that's not that's not what we're looking
[24:10] at but with them that are in Christ them
[24:12] that have accepted the Covenant of the
[24:14] blood and the spirit of God has spoke
[24:17] back into their lives when they walk
[24:19] they walk not after the flesh though
[24:21] they're in the flesh they don't mind the
[24:23] flesh they're not operating by the flesh
[24:26] but yet they're Spirit see that walk
[24:28] after the spirit of God and the and the
[24:31] Bible Paul says it like this for the law
[24:33] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[24:36] has made me free from the law of sin and
[24:40] death now now it's amazing that you can
[24:42] walk in the body of death and not walk
[24:45] under the the under the law of death
[24:48] amen it's not that the law of death is
[24:49] not there it's working on us it's making
[24:51] us older it's making gravity is more
[24:54] affecting us but it yet don't have
[24:55] dominion over us as the scriptures says
[24:58] that we reign in this life by one who is
[25:01] Jesus Christ and the prophets of God
[25:03] said what are we reigning over he said
[25:05] over our over sin over the Flesh and
[25:07] over the devil that even while we're in
[25:10] this body of death we're still reigning
[25:12] over death in that it doesn't have its
[25:15] desired goal in our life amen what is it
[25:18] we walk in the law of the spirit of life
[25:21] and brother man says it like this in
[25:22] God's chosen place of worship he says
[25:24] what is that law of life I have already
[25:26] done it amen if you were here last
[25:28] Sunday we talked a lot about the grace
[25:30] of God Amen of Abraham's Covenant I will
[25:33] which was the one that Adam received
[25:34] after the fall I will amen and the
[25:37] prophet of God said that's what the law
[25:39] of life is Paul's talking about is I've
[25:42] already done it amen see that's Grace
[25:44] it's the law of life God did that for
[25:47] Abraham and his seed after him amen how
[25:50] many Abraham seed we got this morning
[25:52] then there is a law of Life working in
[25:54] you and what is that law that God has
[25:57] already done it brother listen if that
[25:59] ever sinks on the inside of you God has
[26:02] already done it they'll have to clear a
[26:04] running path for the Church of the
[26:05] Living God because every bit of the
[26:08] condemnation on your life will leave you
[26:11] immediately when you recognize God has
[26:13] already did this this is not something
[26:16] that's going to happen but the blood of
[26:18] Jesus Christ has settled the account of
[26:21] the sin death that's against man the
[26:23] prophet of God said matter of fact under
[26:25] your new birth he dismissed the second
[26:28] blood you were born of amen and
[26:30] accounted the blood of Jesus Christ to
[26:32] your life listen there is nothing more
[26:34] powerful than knowing that it's already
[26:36] a finished work come on I'm already
[26:39] saved I'm already confirmed I'm already
[26:41] Vindicated we're already going to have a
[26:44] Rapture we're not going in it we are a
[26:46] part of the Rapture because it's the law
[26:49] of life that works Upon Us brother Bram
[26:52] said That's the Law Christians live by
[26:54] if you're looking to live by law we live
[26:56] by the law of life and that is a law of
[26:59] Grace it's a law of life now somebody
[27:01] said well brother Wayne then then does
[27:03] that mean that the law of sin and death
[27:05] doesn't matter no actually the law of
[27:07] sin and death is still there and is
[27:09] still working and that's why you you
[27:11] struggle that's what you're struggle
[27:13] against is the law of sin and death
[27:15] that's the part of of the life we don't
[27:17] like but there is another law and it's a
[27:20] greater law now the only way best way I
[27:23] know to describe it is you take the law
[27:26] of gravity and and gravity is real if
[27:29] you don't believe in it just jump off a
[27:32] building it'll it'll give you all the
[27:35] teaching you need you don't have to go
[27:36] to college to learn the law of gravity
[27:38] just jump off a building and you'll
[27:40] you'll get an education man it'll happen
[27:42] right quick but but you know there's
[27:44] something about it you go down to the
[27:45] airport and you get in an airplane and
[27:48] the law of gravity is just as real as it
[27:51] always was but there's something about
[27:54] the law of aerodynamics that has the
[27:57] power to Super seeed the law of gravity
[28:00] now there actually I was reading on it
[28:02] last night late and I found out that
[28:04] there are actually Four laws that
[28:06] operate the law of aerodynamics amen
[28:09] some of you some of you flyers in here
[28:11] know those laws and some of you
[28:12] scientists know those laws but I'm going
[28:13] to share them here amen there's four
[28:15] laws to Aviation for the errow of
[28:17] Dynamics and they are lift weight thrust
[28:20] and drag there are four things that
[28:22] operated it's lift and weight and TR
[28:25] thrust and drag in other words that if
[28:27] something is heavy the first law of
[28:30] aerodynamics is there's got to be more
[28:32] lift than there is weight there's got to
[28:34] be more lifting power than there is
[28:36] weight upon the subject I know now why
[28:39] Paul said let us lay aside every weight
[28:43] that would so easily beet us because the
[28:46] lifting power has got to be greater than
[28:49] the weight that's Upon Our Lives listen
[28:51] you ain't going to get off of your chair
[28:53] as long as you're looking at your own
[28:54] works as long as you're looking at your
[28:56] own ability you can't get off of the
[28:59] floor but the moment you accept the
[29:01] blood of Jesus Christ for you and for
[29:04] your life and who you are and where
[29:06] you're going there is a lifting power
[29:08] under the blood of Jesus Christ that can
[29:11] lift a man above the clouds of doubt and
[29:13] fears and troubles everywhere listen I
[29:16] believe there's a law that is working as
[29:18] a law of lifting power and I I I I was
[29:20] thinking it was something else that law
[29:22] has to overcome weight but then the the
[29:24] the the actual law says that there's got
[29:26] to be more thrust than drag in other
[29:29] words you know that's why you look at
[29:31] the uh the planes and they're built uh
[29:33] so streamlined it's because they need to
[29:36] be able to cut through the air so
[29:37] whatever's pushing them needs to be
[29:40] greater than the drag on them that's why
[29:42] you don't see them you you don't see
[29:44] usually parachutes behind uh behind them
[29:46] sometimes they'll drag a a flag but they
[29:49] could wreck real easy if they're not
[29:50] careful cuz they got to keep the
[29:52] throttle on it's got to be a powered
[29:54] ship amen you see them there's got to be
[29:56] a a Thrust that's greater than the drag
[29:59] and I I I think about this because I
[30:01] think about things that lift now if you
[30:04] go back in the uh in the early days of
[30:06] the Egyptians when they built the first
[30:08] pyramids and when even Enoch built his
[30:10] pyramid brother bam tells us this that
[30:12] today we don't have the equipment to do
[30:14] what they done then right back then he
[30:17] said we don't know what they used they
[30:19] must have had something to lift them
[30:22] stones that high you know something to
[30:25] get them they had to have something to
[30:27] get it off the ground ground to place it
[30:29] up there and brother said we don't
[30:30] really have it in this time now but
[30:33] think about what a prophet's talking
[30:35] about Enoch's pyramid and he's talking
[30:36] about how to get the stones way up high
[30:40] that the modern world don't have what it
[30:42] takes to put them Stones up there but
[30:44] I'll say that God has sent a message in
[30:46] this age that has placed the Church of
[30:49] the Living God not down here in the
[30:51] bottom of the pyramid but he's placed
[30:53] her way up high right up there in that
[30:56] capping Stone which is a lifting power
[30:58] and it lifts us above who we are see
[31:01] it's above the identity of your church
[31:04] or it's above the identity of your
[31:06] religion it's above your family it's
[31:09] above who you are as an individual we're
[31:11] talking about the God of Abraham and has
[31:14] come down in this age to lift the church
[31:16] up out of the world and traditions of
[31:18] God and to lift them in his anointing I
[31:21] love how the prophet of God said it's
[31:23] the law of aerodynamics but you know
[31:25] amen we went on past the plane in this
[31:27] age and the church has went on into the
[31:29] astronaut age so there is something
[31:32] that's got to project us Beyond amen the
[31:35] place of coming back
[31:36] down in the airplane you go up you come
[31:39] down you go up you come down but in the
[31:42] astronaut he goes up and he don't come
[31:44] down because he gets beyond the gravity
[31:48] amen that works upon it so there is a
[31:50] place you can go as a believer that
[31:52] where you have broke out into a realm
[31:55] where all things are possible to you you
[31:57] can go somewhere in in your in your
[32:00] world Amen that no matter what day it is
[32:02] no matter what trouble's happening no
[32:04] matter what the issues of Life are there
[32:07] is a place a Believer can go that is
[32:09] beyond the fears it's beyond the doubts
[32:12] it's beyond the troubles amen there's a
[32:14] place where a man can go that it comes
[32:17] into steady sailing in the presence of
[32:20] God you see it's a law I know it's a law
[32:23] of aerodynamics but there is a greater
[32:24] law it is a superseding law and I
[32:27] believe this I believe that it's too bad
[32:30] the church don't walk in that more often
[32:33] and I believe we can I believe it's
[32:35] possible I believe that we are serving a
[32:38] god of Miracles I I don't think this God
[32:42] changes with the situations I I don't
[32:45] believe the god that we serve changes
[32:47] with the weak or with our family life or
[32:50] with whatever it is that you're facing
[32:52] God don't change like that but he's
[32:54] Remains the Same outside the situation
[32:58] and I thank God for that kind of God the
[33:00] one that can remain the same you know I
[33:02] don't know if you've ever took a lot of
[33:04] time to do it but it's a pretty
[33:06] interesting study if you start looking
[33:08] in into miracles in the Bible and you
[33:10] know if you go in just and just a
[33:13] general just a general look at miracles
[33:15] in the Bible do you know there's over 80
[33:17] in the Old Testament and more over 80
[33:20] something more that's in the New
[33:21] Testament we're talking about just
[33:23] Miracles but those Miracles are not just
[33:27] uh uh just just little things but rather
[33:30] great exp exp exponential of the power
[33:35] of God that's made known you know if you
[33:37] go back and you say well you know the
[33:39] God we serve really what can he do
[33:42] well you know he created the heavens and
[33:44] the
[33:46] earth now the to to to worship something
[33:50] brother B said that object is God so you
[33:53] can worship the piano and you can
[33:55] worship your husband you can worship
[33:56] your wife you can worship your church
[33:57] you can worship your preacher you can
[33:59] worship your life you you can worship a
[34:02] lot of things and that made it God
[34:04] because that's the object you worship
[34:06] but when we speak of the God we're
[34:08] serving his name is Elohim meaning he is
[34:12] a self-existent God he is no God of our
[34:15] making but rather we didn't make our God
[34:18] but he made us and he developed Us in
[34:22] such a way that we amen are a part of
[34:24] his creation the same God Amen think
[34:27] about this Elijah the same God Amen that
[34:30] put the heavens up there that hung the
[34:32] stars in their place is the same God
[34:34] that watches over our church service
[34:36] this morning think about that the god
[34:39] that hung the heavens and put Jupiter
[34:41] and Mars and all the stars and Scattered
[34:43] him my that's the same God looking over
[34:46] this service this morning that God who
[34:48] create that atmosphere and put all of
[34:50] that together that's the same God Amen
[34:53] that walked down there one day and made
[34:55] man right out of the out of the uh of
[34:57] the the dust of the earth and then later
[35:00] remember when man fell he was the same
[35:02] God walked out there one day and saw
[35:04] Enoch in a fallen condition and said
[35:06] come on go walk with me amen and after
[35:09] about 365 years of fellowshipping he
[35:12] just took him from one dimension to
[35:13] another what a miracle working God do
[35:16] you not realize that's the god that
[35:18] we're serving in this generation and
[35:21] this bride is to be a generation of
[35:23] people that will change their bodies
[35:25] just like Enoch changed his body and if
[35:28] Enoch changed his body how did he do it
[35:31] he fellowshipped with Elohim until his
[35:34] body changed and I believe this morning
[35:36] that we can fellowship with Elohim God
[35:40] comes down and fellowships with his
[35:42] church and how does he Fellowship he
[35:44] walks with you in the word of God you
[35:47] can walk daily in the word of God and as
[35:49] you fellowship with him your
[35:51] fellowshipping with the same one that
[35:53] could pull the floods and cover the
[35:55] Earth 40 days with water you're you're
[35:57] fellowshipping with the one that could
[35:59] call fire down out of the heavens and
[36:01] destroy the sodomites in in in in Sodom
[36:04] and gomorra that same God was the one
[36:06] that turned that turned Lot's wife into
[36:09] a pillar of salt went down and changed
[36:11] Sarah's body that's the same God that
[36:14] give a hundredy old man a child but he
[36:17] didn't just give him a child he gave him
[36:18] a new body to have a child because
[36:21] that's the God we serve this morning
[36:23] because he's able Church he's more than
[36:26] able to do whatever exceedingly and
[36:28] abundantly above what even you can think
[36:30] or ask I'm talking about God I'm talking
[36:33] about the God that could call a man like
[36:36] Moses from a burning bush and talk to a
[36:38] 80-year old man in such a way that he
[36:41] get under such an influence that he
[36:43] could go down and deliver two and a half
[36:45] million people out of the hand of the
[36:48] greatest armies in the world and what to
[36:51] do with them when he gets them
[36:54] out you think about this man that kind
[36:56] of God that that Moses was serving you
[36:59] know he went down and just told him I
[37:00] was reading quite some details on it
[37:02] this morning I thought it was amazing he
[37:03] went down and told Pharaoh he said turn
[37:05] the people lose and Pharaoh laughs at
[37:07] him we're going to let a 2 and a half
[37:09] million slave Workforce go they're power
[37:12] in all of Egypt man do you see he wasn't
[37:15] about to let let him go but God the god
[37:18] of Miracles used those miracles for that
[37:20] Exodus and watch he began to drop
[37:23] plagues on them I I was reading about it
[37:25] this morning I thought it was pretty
[37:26] amazing because some of these miracles
[37:28] do you know that that The Magicians did
[37:30] them exactly like Moses did them but in
[37:33] every case they could do them but they
[37:35] couldn't take them away see they can
[37:38] bring on Plague but they can't take
[37:40] plagues away but the god that you and I
[37:43] serve amen not only does he bring them
[37:46] he can take them amen he can heal that
[37:49] sick body he can change that situation
[37:51] of your life because he's God he can he
[37:55] can he can just in a moment make it lead
[37:56] your Coast you know I was reading here
[37:58] how God brought
[38:00] frogs and you know Moses prophesies
[38:03] they'll fill the houses and the pots and
[38:05] the lakes and the rivers and and they'll
[38:07] just feel the land will you get that
[38:10] many
[38:12] frogs but the God we serve created the
[38:15] first frog can he create the rest of
[38:18] them frogs and when all them frogs got
[38:21] where they was Pharaoh said Mercy y'all
[38:23] go on out of the country but as soon as
[38:26] as Moses turned around and took the
[38:28] frogs out of the coast just like that
[38:29] frogs left the coast and when they left
[38:32] Pharaoh said well forget it y'all stay a
[38:34] while see that must not have been
[38:36] nothing Supernatural or the or the
[38:37] symptoms wouldn't wouldn't have quit
[38:39] like that see I know you went to the
[38:41] hospital for a stroke but when you got
[38:43] there you said well something's wrong
[38:44] and it maybe it was misjudged and
[38:47] something happened to take it and
[38:49] Pharaoh will always say it wasn't as bad
[38:52] as we first
[38:53] thought no it's not as bad as we first
[38:55] thought because there was a god that we
[38:57] prayed
[38:59] to my mother's been in three different
[39:01] three different stroke episodes where
[39:03] her literally was stroking out and we
[39:05] begin to pray and she don't live today
[39:07] with one effect of any stroke she's ever
[39:10] had because the god of Miracles could
[39:12] step on the SE and he can remove
[39:15] whatever it is the devil is trying to do
[39:18] I know we go through things but amen but
[39:21] years amen don't have to be the subject
[39:23] God of Miracles can change it in a
[39:25] moment I was just reading here of the
[39:28] things that God was doing hey man now do
[39:31] y'all realize the level of of of of of
[39:34] of of of what happens when hell just
[39:37] rains upon their crops and rains upon
[39:40] their country it almost don't leave
[39:42] anything right be phara Pharaoh wouldn't
[39:44] let him go so Moses CS hell and the god
[39:46] of Miracles brings hell and fire upon it
[39:49] and you would think that would be enough
[39:51] but then Moses turns around and CS the
[39:54] Locust to come and eat what's left yeah
[39:58] and then when and when Pharaoh's had
[39:59] enough he just tells them to leave and
[40:01] they all leave because the god of
[40:04] Miracles has the power not just in a
[40:07] little bitty situation but he's a great
[40:10] big God
[40:12] friends I was I was just reading y'all
[40:14] forgive me I get to read and I get to
[40:15] think about things and I think about
[40:17] this darkness that covered the Earth and
[40:19] how that God would be able to move a
[40:22] church out under that kind of a
[40:24] situation and it never touched their
[40:26] homes right because he was such an
[40:29] ability to separate that he could come
[40:31] down and lead them in the middle of a
[40:33] Wilderness and they get out there they
[40:35] got 2 and a half million people and and
[40:37] and of course when they get up to the
[40:39] Red
[40:40] Sea of course they're going to think
[40:43] that the god that brought plagues and
[40:45] took them away and brought two and a
[40:47] half million people out of captivity
[40:51] overnight of course this Red Sea is
[40:53] going to stop
[40:54] them isn't it amazing how we forget the
[40:58] hand of God just a couple days ago they
[41:02] saw all of that and now they're standing
[41:05] there amen thinking they're going to
[41:06] have to die at the Red Sea but there's
[41:09] something that hadn't changed their
[41:11] location had changed the circumstance
[41:14] had changed but the god that had
[41:16] delivered them was right there with them
[41:19] listen let me say this morning he made a
[41:21] promise to remain with the Church of the
[41:23] Living God brother Ram said he'll be
[41:25] with us till we get to that millennium
[41:27] he's not going to leave us in this lead
[41:29] of sea he's not going to leave us in our
[41:31] struggles and in our trials he promised
[41:33] to remain with us and as long as he's
[41:36] with us he is the god of Miracles listen
[41:38] I I I was just reading here that they of
[41:41] course they cross the Red Sea and
[41:43] there's no way to explain that but
[41:46] God right and others couldn't follow
[41:48] them they get on the other side and you
[41:50] got two and a half million people get
[41:51] thirsty what hole you going to water
[41:53] them
[41:54] in so we we found out they come up to
[41:57] some Waters and they were bitter but the
[41:59] god of Miracles said I can take bitter
[42:01] water make it
[42:02] [Applause]
[42:03] sweet that's kind of God you want to run
[42:06] around with cuz there's going to be
[42:08] bitter things happen but he can take the
[42:11] bitter and make it
[42:14] sweet you you see the the Hebrew
[42:16] children went into the fire they really
[42:18] went into the fire but because they were
[42:20] with the god of Abraham because they
[42:23] were with the god of Miracles God took
[42:25] the heat out of the fire
[42:28] that's the kind of God he is you can be
[42:30] in the most fiery trial of your life but
[42:32] God can take the heat out of it and
[42:35] you'll find out God can fellowship with
[42:37] you in that fire and get the best
[42:39] Fellowship of your life you're going
[42:41] through the greatest struggle you've
[42:42] ever been in your life and God come down
[42:45] and fellowship with you in it and i' I
[42:47] preached on a bunch of times I don't
[42:48] want to repr preach on it but but you
[42:50] all heard brother Brown tell the story
[42:52] when Jesus went in there the fourth man
[42:53] went in with the Flames with them he
[42:55] said he reached up and got a palm leaf
[42:57] off of the Sea of life and brought it
[42:59] down there and was Fanning the Flames he
[43:01] said there if you would have looked in
[43:03] there you would have saw them Hebrew
[43:04] children sitting around the fire talking
[43:06] yeah they were fellowshipping with the
[43:08] Lord amen in the middle of that
[43:11] flame I got to wonder what they
[43:13] Fellowship about what in the world did
[43:16] the Lord talk to them about in the
[43:18] middle of that flame I've got a prophet
[43:20] you know what he said he said they were
[43:22] talking about their
[43:25] future there they were in the world
[43:27] worst thing in their life and God was
[43:29] talking about them what they're going to
[43:31] do tomorrow listen I don't know where
[43:33] you are or what kind of situation you
[43:35] are in get you a book and an ink pen and
[43:38] start fellowshipping with the Lord and
[43:40] write down what God is going to do for
[43:42] you tomorrow what he going to do for you
[43:45] next month if the doctors told you that
[43:47] you got cancer and you're going to die
[43:49] get you a notebook and start making
[43:51] plans you don't have to listen to the
[43:54] devil he does not control the future of
[43:56] this church nor does it control the
[43:58] future of a Believer because God who is
[44:01] rich in Mercy is the god of Miracles and
[44:03] I I I I there's way too many for me to
[44:06] get into them but I I'll just say this
[44:08] God that same God walking with them he
[44:10] was the one brought that water out of
[44:11] the rock y'all heard his preach on it
[44:13] Thursday night it was Unreal when you
[44:15] get to studying the millions and
[44:17] billions of gallons of water that was
[44:19] flowing out if you wasn't here we
[44:21] figured out this just just by simple
[44:24] math we fig from Richard it ain't simple
[44:26] to me
[44:27] but simple math we figured out that that
[44:30] there was 40 times the forest coming out
[44:33] of that rock than there was coming out
[44:36] of Old Faithful out there in the park 40
[44:40] times the amount of water and I and I'll
[44:43] just say this y'all don't think that
[44:44] water went out there and running the
[44:45] ground do
[44:47] you there was there was people out there
[44:50] miles away from Israel drinking water
[44:53] and thought that their gods were
[44:54] blessing them they were right in songs
[44:57] down there 5 Mile Away saying amen
[45:00] worshiping some some God or something
[45:02] drinking water but everything they got
[45:04] was they was getting because Israel was
[45:06] there let me say today if there's any
[45:09] inspiration on the earth it's because
[45:11] God has opened up a message for the
[45:14] Bride of Jesus Christ every song that's
[45:17] written every inspiration that's given
[45:19] you say oh they preached A good sermon
[45:21] it's our water brother oh they had a
[45:24] good point it's my water amen song don't
[45:27] belong to the world it belongs to
[45:30] you how do you know that God didn't have
[45:33] that woman right scattered just for
[45:35] you who do you think God has more on his
[45:39] mind I know what he's got on his mind
[45:42] he's got this Bride on his mind and even
[45:45] before Moses before the water in the
[45:48] rock it was a bride coming in the last
[45:51] day and this message was already in the
[45:53] mind of God how he would bring it out of
[45:55] such a simple place
[46:01] now the amount of water that was coming
[46:02] out there was insane and so I just was
[46:05] reading this morning or yesterday I was
[46:07] listening to the tape called Jehovah of
[46:08] Miracles and as I was listening to the
[46:10] tape brother randam got talking about
[46:11] Moses and he got talking about the grace
[46:13] of God and he says uh oh I'm all messed
[46:18] up here
[46:19] sorry un cth no
[46:23] manners you visitors forgive me
[46:28] but you thank
[46:29] you that was
[46:34] one
[46:36] Moses Moses got him out there and the
[46:38] Book of Numbers records this this it's
[46:40] very powerful the way this recorded is
[46:43] that people got tired not having meat so
[46:46] remember they wanted they wanted meat
[46:48] and you know what God did he told him
[46:51] said I'll tell you what I'm going to do
[46:52] I'm going to bring meat but not for a
[46:54] day I'm going to bring meat not for a
[46:56] week we I'm going to bring it for a
[46:59] month it's going to be so much that it's
[47:02] going to run out your
[47:04] nostrils H now you know where it comes
[47:07] from they got enough money it runs out
[47:09] their
[47:12] nose you really you know where that
[47:14] comes from you ever hear it so well they
[47:16] got so much they got so much gas that's
[47:18] running out their nose so much Heen it's
[47:21] running out their nostrils it's quail
[47:24] and you know the Bible said that there
[47:26] was a there was a wind come up off of
[47:28] the sea and blew Quail into their camp
[47:31] now you think about this because the
[47:33] Bible goes on to say I I've got some of
[47:35] the figures written down here I better
[47:37] get to them they're too important to
[47:39] miss you you get into these uh oh
[47:48] boy
[47:50] somewhere you get into these numbers and
[47:53] and the scripture
[47:55] says that they was
[47:57] so many
[47:59] quail that they were three or two cubits
[48:03] high now that's about one meter 3
[48:08] feet it's three three feet I'm I'm
[48:11] probably got to get high on me to get
[48:12] three feet
[48:18] but 3
[48:20] feet 3 foot high in any way you walked
[48:24] out of the camp it was a Day's Journey
[48:28] oh now the quail was 3T
[48:31] deep and it was a day Journey any
[48:35] direction you took off to walk out of
[48:37] them
[48:37] Quail y'all got any
[48:41] clue now I was thinking maybe a 23 mile
[48:44] a day
[48:45] thing that was 7.2 trillion Quail but if
[48:49] you back it off to 15 just to make up
[48:52] for some of the slower people 15 miles
[48:55] walking a day walk 15 miles we went up
[48:59] brother Richard come up with 2 trillion
[49:04] Quail that's trillion folks now it's
[49:08] going to surprise you to know this
[49:09] there's only 35 million Quail population
[49:13] in the
[49:14] world where' they get all them
[49:18] Quil there's only 35 million in the
[49:21] whole world and there was 2 and A2
[49:22] trillion laying around the camp because
[49:26] God is is a god of Miracles he created
[49:29] the first Quail he can create Quail 3ot
[49:32] deep if he wants to because he remains
[49:34] to be
[49:37] God you know that the Bible goes on to
[49:40] say there were 600,000 uh fighting men
[49:42] right in that same scripture there was
[49:43] 600,000 fighting men and brother bandam
[49:46] goes on to say that there was about two
[49:48] Quail per meal per person he said there
[49:52] had to been at least five million Quail
[49:54] he's talking about one meal God's
[49:55] talking about one month
[49:57] so if you took six quails a
[50:00] day per
[50:02] person you end
[50:05] up with a
[50:12] lot think about
[50:15] that now now when we got to when we got
[50:17] to figuring that we we went okay now the
[50:20] scripture says this it actually says
[50:22] this it says that he that gathered the
[50:25] least
[50:27] gathered 55
[50:29] bushels some say 70 bushels but it was
[50:32] uh 10
[50:34] hmer so he that gathered the least if
[50:37] you had 600,000 men Gathering no women
[50:39] no children just the men Gathering
[50:42] you're talking about
[50:44] 33,000 bushels of
[50:47] quail there's a lot of leftovers
[50:51] folks there was a lot of things out
[50:54] there God when he does something he
[50:56] don't have to just do a little bit he
[51:00] can do so much that you don't know what
[51:02] to do with it God said he would open up
[51:05] the heavens and pour out his blessings
[51:07] until you cannot contain it listen God
[51:10] has said goodness and mercy shall follow
[51:12] me all the days of my life my God don't
[51:15] have to just dribble out a little
[51:17] blessing he can bless you from the top
[51:19] of your head to the bottom of your feet
[51:22] he can bless your finances he can bless
[51:24] your family he can bless your church he
[51:26] can bless your life and he don't just do
[51:29] it a little bit he does it in abundance
[51:33] because he's the god of Miracles he can
[51:36] do all of that and he still got Quail
[51:38] left
[51:40] over he don't have to just dribble
[51:42] things
[51:43] out brother man said we have untapped
[51:46] resources as a Church of the Living God
[51:49] Amen because God who is rich in Mercy
[51:51] now I'm not going to get into the other
[51:53] 160 definite miracles in the Bible but I
[51:55] think it's amazing when you sit down and
[51:57] begin to examine that what kind of God
[52:01] you know what brother B does in Jehovah
[52:02] Miracles he takes this story of Mary
[52:05] meditating on the Lord and shows that
[52:08] this is how she had the encounter with
[52:10] the angel was she was thinking about
[52:13] what was preached yesterday at church
[52:15] and she was thinking about the scripture
[52:18] that had been shared and while she had
[52:20] that on her mind that's when he came
[52:23] near to her brother bam tells us this
[52:26] that's
[52:27] what happened out there when I was
[52:29] sitting next to that sycamore tree now
[52:32] watch the Bible says this that if you
[52:35] submit yourself therefore to God if you
[52:38] will resist the devil he will flee from
[52:43] you and if you draw nigh to God He will
[52:47] draw nigh to you now think about this
[52:51] God of heaven will draw nigh to you when
[52:54] you draw nigh to him how do I draw nigh
[52:57] to God get the scripture on your mind
[53:00] meditate upon the goodness of God get to
[53:03] thinking about the presence of God and
[53:05] angels will come in the room where
[53:07] you're sitting I tell you this amen the
[53:10] Bible tells us this brother Bram brought
[53:13] this scripture to Life by meditating
[53:15] upon it for verily I say unto thee that
[53:17] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[53:19] be thou moved and cast in the sea and
[53:21] shall not doubt in his heart but Shall
[53:23] Believe the things which he say shall
[53:24] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[53:28] saith brother bam says it like this he
[53:30] said I'd get that on my mind and I just
[53:32] couldn't get away from it and everywhere
[53:34] I'd go it would constantly come to me if
[53:37] you say to this mountain be thou plucked
[53:39] and cast and sea don't doubt in your
[53:40] heart but shall believe he says see this
[53:42] just kept coming and he said i' just
[53:45] think about this and then I'd think well
[53:47] that's before the atonement or that's
[53:49] after the atonement and he said I would
[53:51] say well you know if if you say then
[53:54] what have I got to do with it cuz I
[53:55] can't create
[53:57] he says but what it is it's your
[53:59] attitude toward the blessing of the
[54:02] atonement it's how do you think about
[54:04] the atonement what's your attitude y'all
[54:06] know that attitude's also another uh uh
[54:09] aerodynamic law attitude it's how the
[54:12] the plane is set up is how it flies
[54:15] because you can be flying get the wrong
[54:17] attitude you don't get nowhere you fly
[54:19] real
[54:21] slow that's
[54:23] free but it's your attitude toward the
[54:25] blessing
[54:27] see that's the thing what's your
[54:28] attitude toward the atonement listen it
[54:31] brother bam says it like this as far as
[54:34] God is concerned that's what I'm worried
[54:36] about what's God concerned with what's
[54:40] God thinking about as far as God was
[54:43] concerned I was saved when Jesus
[54:47] [Music]
[54:48] died Hallelujah Lord I was saved when
[54:53] Jesus died as far as God is concerned
[54:56] well brother I'll take
[54:59] that I'll accept that right now I'll
[55:02] accept that I won't accept any other
[55:04] thought than that one well if you do
[55:07] this or if you do this or if you do that
[55:09] no sir I don't want none of those
[55:11] thoughts as far as God is concerned I
[55:14] was saved when he went to Calvary I say
[55:17] I accept it and by the grace of God I'll
[55:19] stand on it and if I shout or if I don't
[55:22] shout if I get energy or if I don't get
[55:25] energy amen if if I feel good if I feel
[55:27] bad early in the morning late at night
[55:30] it makes no difference to me at all he
[55:33] said as far as God is concerned I was
[55:36] saved well brother Wayne what about this
[55:39] what about this what about the word what
[55:41] about the God of Heaven that is eternal
[55:44] life his word means more than all the
[55:47] critics and all the thoughts God said it
[55:50] I believe it brother that settles it in
[55:52] this life amen as far as God is
[55:55] concerned
[55:56] that's what I'm worried about brother
[55:59] Ram says it like this I was saved but
[56:00] it'll never do me no good till it's
[56:02] revealed to me he's the son of God and
[56:04] I've accepted it and every scripture is
[56:07] the
[56:09] same and every scripture is the same
[56:13] Divine Healing is for
[56:16] you come on John
[56:18] Guthrie Hallelujah Divine Healing is for
[56:22] you it's not for the
[56:24] 1960s it's not for the back in the 1500s
[56:27] it's not back in Luther's day or
[56:28] Wesley's day but Divine Healing is for
[56:31] John Guthrie as a testimony God heals
[56:35] cancer sitting right in the building
[56:37] right now God will pick somebody and
[56:40] prove his word by that person and God
[56:42] don't ever have to prove it again I can
[56:44] preach it all over the world he's a
[56:47] Healer of cancer if he never does it
[56:49] again brother I've got a case of it
[56:51] sitting here but I got a lot more than
[56:53] one case
[56:56] I got a lot more than one case that God
[56:58] healed
[56:59] cancer brother ver brother sitting right
[57:02] there his dad was sitting in a meeting
[57:04] just like this maybe a little different
[57:06] but something near it and he was sitting
[57:08] this and the pastor was telling a
[57:09] testimony about a Gorder falling off of
[57:11] a woman's neck in the middle of a prayer
[57:13] line and what he was telling it his dad
[57:15] sitting there with a cancer on his arm
[57:18] he said well if God did that for that
[57:19] woman he can do this for me and he went
[57:21] to rub it and the thing fell off in the
[57:23] floor because the god
[57:26] of Miracles is a cancer killing
[57:30] god sister Barb he didn't just do it for
[57:33] verin's Daddy but sitting right in this
[57:36] building the atmosphere got so right
[57:38] that that cancer dropped right off of
[57:40] her what happened brother the
[57:42] overshadowing of the Holy Ghost that's
[57:45] how it works that's how the power of God
[57:47] is it's not all of my mental intellect
[57:50] and how well I can put it together it's
[57:52] whether or not I believe in the atoning
[57:54] power of the blood of Jesus Christ that
[57:57] brings the spirit of God comes in this
[58:00] room and changes
[58:02] lives yes sir that's how it happened
[58:05] that's how it happened see that's how it
[58:09] takes place how it happened in my new
[58:11] ministry it's a powerful section brother
[58:13] BR said in my new ministry he said I was
[58:15] sitting there next to that sycamore tree
[58:17] and he said the scripture just kept
[58:19] coming to
[58:21] me now that's pretty powerful that that
[58:24] scripture just kept coming to me and he
[58:26] said
[58:28] see I was there for about a half hour
[58:31] before I could get to the rest of the
[58:32] boys and I thought I'll just study that
[58:34] scripture now he had that scripture in
[58:36] his mind and while he's studying that
[58:41] scripture something come along and said
[58:44] to him I got to talking to myself he
[58:47] said and after a while I realized it was
[58:50] somebody
[58:52] else and he said I become so conscious
[58:56] till I was talking to someone and
[58:58] something said to me that's in the
[59:00] atonement for if a man or a woman is so
[59:04] concentrated and surrendered to God that
[59:07] God moves in and uses their voice and it
[59:09] isn't the man
[59:11] speaking it's God that's in him
[59:15] speaking oh
[59:17] Brothers God getting in a man speaking
[59:23] see for verily I say unto you
[59:26] that whosoever shall say to this
[59:28] mountain be thou moved and cast in the
[59:30] sea and won't doubt it in his heart but
[59:33] Shall Believe the things which he saith
[59:35] shall come to pass he shall have
[59:37] whatsoever he saith it's not because of
[59:41] the man that's saying it it's because of
[59:44] the god of Miracles that's using the
[59:46] vocal cords to speak
[59:48] it brother bam tells us that this is
[59:50] actually the age now you read about in
[59:52] Romans 8 and and people say well this
[59:54] age ain't really no different other age
[59:55] I beg dep pardon it is a great
[59:57] difference this is the age of the
[59:59] manifestation of the sons of God from
[1:00:01] Romans the 18th chapter and the e8th
[1:00:03] chapter and the 19th verse the Bible
[1:00:05] tells us that the whole creation waited
[1:00:07] for this manifestation of sons and that
[1:00:10] manifestation is today do youall know
[1:00:12] why the seals actually opened youall
[1:00:14] know what that it wasn't just so we
[1:00:15] could take it and intellectually talk
[1:00:17] about it and distribute it and and move
[1:00:19] with it brother random said God opened
[1:00:21] these things he said because he was
[1:00:23] going to manifest through the sons of
[1:00:25] God who you know the scripture teaches
[1:00:28] we are here that's the reason God is
[1:00:30] opening these things because God is
[1:00:32] bringing Sons into
[1:00:35] manifestation that's why the seals open
[1:00:37] because God is bringing Sons into
[1:00:39] manifestation there are people setting
[1:00:42] in this building this morning I'm not
[1:00:44] just talking about in the message
[1:00:45] General but I'm talking about mature
[1:00:47] Sons and Daughters of God sitting in
[1:00:49] this building I believe that there's a
[1:00:51] church on the road tonight I believe
[1:00:53] it's here 1953 brother Ram said it's com
[1:00:56] and I believe tonight there this morning
[1:00:58] we can announce it's here the church is
[1:01:00] here there's a bride here she's on the
[1:01:03] Earth today and brother bam said when
[1:01:05] the power of the Living God will speak
[1:01:07] the word here and there it'll flash like
[1:01:09] lightning a church coming out not a
[1:01:11] bunch of psychologist or put on or make
[1:01:13] believes but a real true genuine
[1:01:16] anointed Holy Ghost called church now
[1:01:19] you say preacher how's that going to
[1:01:20] happen brother Bram said when the human
[1:01:21] element goes
[1:01:23] out when the human element goes out the
[1:01:26] deity the element takes over see when
[1:01:28] the human element is set aside when you
[1:01:30] quit getting caught up in your human
[1:01:32] side when you quit telling God you can't
[1:01:34] do this through me because I did this
[1:01:36] because I said because I thought because
[1:01:38] I felt as long as you're in that
[1:01:41] Dimension Satan will rule your life the
[1:01:43] rest of your life but the moment you
[1:01:46] step out of I can and I can and I will
[1:01:48] and I do and step over in God has
[1:01:51] supplied every need of mine through the
[1:01:54] blood of Jesus Christ listen the blood
[1:01:56] ain't just enough to save you it's
[1:01:59] enough to save the whole world it's not
[1:02:01] just enough to save the Old Testament
[1:02:03] but the New Testament and it's so
[1:02:05] powerful it's so powerful that the very
[1:02:08] ones throughout the ages that have
[1:02:11] persecuted this name in Israel is going
[1:02:13] to get saved after the
[1:02:18] fact explain that to
[1:02:22] me you won't do it through you won't do
[1:02:26] it through natural
[1:02:28] theology at some point you're going to
[1:02:29] have to tell you it's the grace of
[1:02:31] God
[1:02:33] right that great church will go forth in
[1:02:35] the power do you know what the prophet
[1:02:37] said about the church he said it'll come
[1:02:39] to pass in this church that missing lims
[1:02:42] will be added in the middle of your
[1:02:44] service y'all know why he said that he
[1:02:47] said that because he prayed for somebody
[1:02:49] with leukemia in the back room and they
[1:02:52] were healed and brother B said the only
[1:02:53] way that leukemia could be healed is God
[1:02:55] would have get in the blood cell and
[1:02:56] change it and he said if God can get in
[1:02:59] the blood cell and change it he can get
[1:03:00] in the blood cell and grow a
[1:03:02] limb he made the first one he growed the
[1:03:06] first body why can't he grow a body amen
[1:03:08] somebody said well brother amen y'all

[1:03:15] first one that does it listen there's a
[1:03:17] there's a power sweeping to the Church
[1:03:19] of the Living God listen this is a last
[1:03:22] and final sleep not only will he get new
[1:03:24] legs you'll get a new body not only will
[1:03:27] the church get new this and new that
[1:03:29] we'll get a body that can walk from one
[1:03:31] dimension to another because I'm walking
[1:03:34] with a god of
[1:03:35] Miracles the age has changed but Brother
[1:03:38] Andy God ain't changed the same God that
[1:03:41] met me at the altar we'll meet your
[1:03:44] young people at the altar the same God
[1:03:47] that gave me the Holy Ghost I Lov it I
[1:03:48] was listen to brother Brandon this
[1:03:49] morning Amen brother Aiden you'll like
[1:03:51] this he said that same God that put the
[1:03:53] color in the flower put the holy ghost
[1:03:56] in my
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:03:58] heart if he can put the color in the
[1:04:00] flower he can put the holy spirit in
[1:04:03] your
[1:04:04] life my Lord to think about that God he
[1:04:09] can create it he'll do it again y'all
[1:04:11] say well brother brother Wayne that's a
[1:04:12] long time coming that's a long ways off
[1:04:14] I was preaching a meeting over in Norway
[1:04:16] just a few years ago and I got to
[1:04:18] preaching on the Seven stars of The Book
[1:04:20] of Revelations and I got the name in
[1:04:22] those stars from Paul all the way to the
[1:04:24] seventh star and when I got to that
[1:04:26] seventh one I said his name is a man
[1:04:28] named William brandham the seventh angel
[1:04:30] of God that had the message to the L out
[1:04:31] of see and age and fulfill the seventh
[1:04:33] angel of Revelations 10 and when I
[1:04:35] announced that seventh angel was a man
[1:04:37] named William brandham there was a woman
[1:04:39] sitting in the back of the medium of
[1:04:40] leukemia a year later she came up to me
[1:04:43] and she said brother Wayne I know you
[1:04:45] never even prayed for me she said but I
[1:04:47] was sitting in that meeting when you
[1:04:48] were preaching on the Myster of seven
[1:04:50] stars and she said when you said the
[1:04:52] Seven Stars a man named William brandom
[1:04:54] there was a sweet hot feeling started at
[1:04:57] the top of my head and went clear
[1:04:59] through to the bottom of my feet she
[1:05:01] said brother I've been completely healed
[1:05:03] of leukemia listen that's the reason
[1:05:05] brother bam said that lims would be
[1:05:07] added because the god of Miracles the
[1:05:10] god of William brandom is the god of
[1:05:12] Wayne Lawson he's the god of Ry Ericson
[1:05:15] he's the god of true Earth Tabernacle
[1:05:18] he's my God and I worship him as the god
[1:05:21] of Miracles he's not dead he's not a
[1:05:23] stone Idol he's not a history lesson
[1:05:26] he's an everpresent help in the time of
[1:05:29] trouble brother there ain't nothing too
[1:05:31] big there ain't nothing that's too wrong
[1:05:33] that my God cannot fix
[1:05:36] it yes sir he's God he is God and there
[1:05:40] is none like
[1:05:41] him so well you're going to move
[1:05:43] mountains listen de
[1:05:46] can I know there's been entire entire uh
[1:05:50] teachings that John 14:12 doesn't belong
[1:05:53] to the church that's a lie out of the
[1:05:55] pit a
[1:05:56] hell that is a hindering demon that has
[1:06:00] tried to rob you of the privilege of the
[1:06:02] end time message that God has ministered
[1:06:04] to you a Divine gift of the spoken word
[1:06:08] it's part of our inheritance
[1:06:12] folks somebody said well he that he that
[1:06:15] believeth it was a personal pronoun
[1:06:17] really what about where the Bible said
[1:06:18] he that believeth have eternal life is
[1:06:20] that personal too is that just one
[1:06:22] person come on come on Church what about
[1:06:25] it he that overcometh shall I grant a
[1:06:27] set with me is that just personal
[1:06:30] too come on church or does that he
[1:06:32] represent many people come on I believe
[1:06:35] it I believe William brandom represented
[1:06:37] this bride I believe as a part of this
[1:06:39] bride body he was a prophet of the age
[1:06:41] and he was a sheath waved I believe the
[1:06:44] first mature son stood in this earth he
[1:06:47] was waved Over The People Under The Gift
[1:06:49] of the third pool but the Bible tells us
[1:06:51] that when you wave a sheath it's just
[1:06:54] for the acceptance of the field and if
[1:06:57] there was a sheath there's a field if
[1:06:59] there was one wheat there's a field full
[1:07:01] of Wheat and there's a seed in this age
[1:07:03] a bride that knows the god of Abraham is
[1:07:06] the god of Miracles listen there is
[1:07:08] nothing impossible with you there is
[1:07:10] nothing impossible with this church
[1:07:12] doesn't make no difference what the
[1:07:14] circumstance God can change it God can
[1:07:17] make it different listen you said well
[1:07:20] brother Wayne I don't know if John 14
[1:07:21] fits with me brother BR said if it
[1:07:22] didn't you've got amnesia
[1:07:26] come on Mark 11 says if you say to this
[1:07:29] mountain joh brother B ties John 14:12
[1:07:31] to Mark 11 if you say to this mountain
[1:07:33] be moved don't doubt in your heart it
[1:07:35] shall come to pass can you be identified
[1:07:38] there to believe that that is the truth
[1:07:41] if it hasn't you got spiritual Amnesia
[1:07:45] you have forgot you have lost your
[1:07:47] Christian
[1:07:49] balance when you tell me the spoken word
[1:07:52] don't belong to the individual in this
[1:07:54] church you have lost your balance you
[1:07:57] have took God and put him on one man but
[1:07:59] the Bible doesn't say in this age I know
[1:08:02] in Isaiah 7 it says behold Isaiah 9:6 he
[1:08:05] says the government should be on his
[1:08:06] shoulders and he shall come forth and
[1:08:08] his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God
[1:08:10] With Us that's not the prophecy of this
[1:08:13] age William brandom did not come under
[1:08:15] the prophecy of God With Us it wasn't
[1:08:17] all God in a prophet and the church just
[1:08:19] stood by and there was no power but the
[1:08:22] Bible said yet a little while the world
[1:08:24] seeth me no more but Jes shall see me
[1:08:26] for I will be with you even to the end
[1:08:29] of the Earth it's the eye he's in the
[1:08:32] house he's in the House Church listen if
[1:08:36] God is in you the god of Miracles is in
[1:08:39] you then there is no weapon that is form
[1:08:41] that can prosper against the Church of
[1:08:43] the Living God I say there is nothing
[1:08:46] that can defeat her because God is in
[1:08:48] her
[1:08:50] [Applause]
[1:08:55] oh yeah so what are you talking about
[1:08:57] the Holy Ghost is tabernacling
[1:09:02] deity it's Tabernacle in deity I know
[1:09:05] people are talking right now a lot of a
[1:09:07] lot of Atomic Warfare is talked and
[1:09:09] Russia's talking who's got the biggest
[1:09:10] bombs and the most power in the world
[1:09:13] well I got news for Putin and I got news
[1:09:16] for Biden he probably couldn't hear it
[1:09:17] but I got news for
[1:09:20] him the greatest power in the world is
[1:09:23] not an atomic bomb but a Believer that's
[1:09:26] in contact with his
[1:09:28] maker you are the most powerful force on
[1:09:31] the face of the Earth there is not
[1:09:33] enough demons to defeat the church there
[1:09:36] is not enough power in hell to stop this
[1:09:39] church because the god of Miracles that
[1:09:42] been created the Earth is in
[1:09:44] [Applause]
[1:09:47] her I know in the middle of the trials
[1:09:49] it seems I know what it does you sit and
[1:09:52] watch a condition and it it starts to
[1:09:54] affect you
[1:09:56] yeah but get a visitation with that
[1:09:59] angel just a little
[1:10:02] while just get a visitation with him and
[1:10:05] it'll change your
[1:10:07] view you know the funny thing we were we
[1:10:10] were discussing this yesterday brother

[1:10:18] talking about and he said well the Lord
[1:10:20] has spoke several things to him and I
[1:10:22] said you know the power of that is
[1:10:24] brother Brian when God speaks to you it
[1:10:27] changes your
[1:10:29] focus you can be looking at the worst
[1:10:31] situation you can imagine but you're not
[1:10:34] looking at it like other people are
[1:10:36] looking at it because you fellowship

[1:10:41] it listen I know if you if you're in the
[1:10:43] dark on everything you don't know what's

[1:10:58] like a mess now but there's something
[1:11:01] coming and you may be looking at a mess
[1:11:03] in your life saying I don't know how
[1:11:04] this could be and I don't know what this
[1:11:06] could be but don't you never forget the
[1:11:08] Bible it said all things work together
[1:11:10] for the good of them that love God n
[1:11:12] amen if God be for us who can be against
[1:11:16] us we are more than conquerors in all
[1:11:18] things who Christ Jesus our lord there
[1:11:21] is no demon there is no power there is
[1:11:24] nothing that'll stop the Church of the
[1:11:26] Living God I'm not lost my mind I
[1:11:30] visited with the angel he said tell them
[1:11:34] I'm the god of
[1:11:36] [Applause]

[1:12:21] getting getting short on time but I'll
[1:12:22] tell you
[1:12:24] this I gu something on my heart on it's
[1:12:27] burning real strong all right
[1:12:31] you meditate upon scripture and that
[1:12:35] scripture becomes living to
[1:12:37] you the prophet of God said keep your
[1:12:39] heart tuned in with God that's when he
[1:12:43] appears watch this Solomon said as a man
[1:12:46] thinketh so is he now brother man said
[1:12:48] now watch here's here's Five Points that
[1:12:51] he makes on thinking I I I actually
[1:12:53] numbered them if you want them I can
[1:12:54] give them to you he says see thinketh
[1:12:56] it's all one paragraph but I just
[1:12:57] numbered them he said you get to
[1:13:00] thinking this you're one of his
[1:13:04] children
[1:13:06] Hallelujah if I'm one of his
[1:13:09] kids you tell me really if your daddy
[1:13:13] owns a thousand a cattle on a thousand
[1:13:16] hills and he can wave his hand give you
[1:13:18] whatever you want whenever you want
[1:13:20] whenever you not everybody's got access
[1:13:22] to that
[1:13:23] wealth but his children children and
[1:13:26] brother R said the first thought you
[1:13:28] need to keep in your mind is you're his
[1:13:30] child don't let no devil talk you out of
[1:13:33] that you're his
[1:13:35] child then and now watch this you don't
[1:13:37] think maybe that it has power but let me
[1:13:39] let me assure you this the power of
[1:13:42] thought can whip every demon in this
[1:13:46] room if it's placed on the right
[1:13:50] thing you said preacher what are you
[1:13:52] talking about I'm talking about a man
[1:13:53] named shamgar standing out in the middle
[1:13:55] of a field 600 coming at
[1:13:57] him and because we've had a prophet he
[1:14:00] could tell us what he was
[1:14:02] thinking brother bandam told us what he
[1:14:04] was thinking he told us what other
[1:14:05] people was thinking and he was right why
[1:14:08] couldn't we believe he he knew what
[1:14:09] shamgar was thinking and shamgar was
[1:14:12] thinking I can't let him come and take
[1:14:13] another crop my family's not going to
[1:14:15] make it if I do so shamgar brother BR
[1:14:18] said had this thought I am a Seed of
[1:14:23] Abraham I'm a Seed of Abraham and
[1:14:26] there's a promise over Abraham's seed I
[1:14:28] will conquer every gate of my enemy if
[1:14:31] I'm the Seed of Abraham I am a possessor
[1:14:34] of Heaven and Earth if I'm a Seed of
[1:14:36] Abraham as a blessing over my life if
[1:14:39] I'm a Seed of Abraham there is no gate
[1:14:42] there is nothing that I cannot conquer
[1:14:44] if you ever get it in your heart I'm a
[1:14:45] Seed of Abraham that thought
[1:14:49] alone put a lock nood in a man's hand he
[1:14:51] killed 600 Philistines in one fight
[1:14:58] yeah
[1:15:00] man somebody said he was powerful no he
[1:15:03] just got the right
[1:15:05] thought brother B said you're one of his
[1:15:08] children number two that he saved
[1:15:10] you you ever get that in your mind he
[1:15:14] found you then you ain't going to be
[1:15:16] worried about him losing
[1:15:19] you if if you found him okay I got you
[1:15:23] this is all your doing you come you can
[1:15:26] walk you found him you can lose
[1:15:30] him but if you ever realize he found
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:36] you they sang the song he found me when
[1:15:40] I was
[1:15:42] nothing that's the way he finds
[1:15:45] you and if he found you keep that on
[1:15:48] your mind keep on your mind he's good to
[1:15:52] you God's good to you
[1:15:55] am look at look and I don't have time to
[1:15:58] preach God's good to
[1:16:00] you look at Eve look at Eve leaving in
[1:16:02] the Garden of Eden look how good God was
[1:16:05] to
[1:16:05] her Satan said well he don't want you to
[1:16:08] know
[1:16:09] truth he just don't want you to know the
[1:16:11] difference of good like God's goodness
[1:16:13] was somehow
[1:16:15] evil anytime Satan interprets something
[1:16:18] to you that's the way it comes
[1:16:20] out I learned that I learned that the
[1:16:23] hard way I learned that my wife's not
[1:16:26] here this morning I learned that because
[1:16:28] we went through a situation where after
[1:16:30] years after Bethany was born she prayed
[1:16:32] and prayed and prayed and prayed and
[1:16:33] prayed for a baby and and she conceived
[1:16:36] four or five years after Bethany we're
[1:16:37] going to have this baby and we've told
[1:16:39] the whole world and she's she's right on
[1:16:41] the end of it and the doctors are saying
[1:16:42] you don't need to continue uh you need
[1:16:45] to have some surgeries and things happen
[1:16:47] and so all of a sudden we had all this
[1:16:49] wonderful thing we're telling the whole
[1:16:50] world and she loses the
[1:16:53] baby and all the a sudden Satan rushes
[1:16:55] in and says well you done this wrong
[1:16:58] well you done this wrong this is why the
[1:17:00] baby was happening this is something you
[1:17:02] said this to that and that person said
[1:17:04] this and this did this and and you know
[1:17:06] what's what's funny is he didn't just
[1:17:07] offer one idea he offered all the ideas
[1:17:11] until one
[1:17:13] hit and you know how you know which one
[1:17:15] hits is the one you stop and talk to
[1:17:17] other people about it's the one you
[1:17:19] meditate on it's the one he can put he
[1:17:21] can pour out a thousand ideas and none
[1:17:24] of them if ffect you but he finally
[1:17:26] finds that one
[1:17:28] spot is't that amazing he tells the same
[1:17:31] lie to a thousand people and only
[1:17:33] affects
[1:17:34] you because you have an open spot for
[1:17:37] that devil and when he starts twisting
[1:17:39] it look what he do he'll take you out of
[1:17:41] the garden and put you in pain and
[1:17:43] misery and trials and all kinds of
[1:17:46] situations God ain't good and God's got
[1:17:48] this and God's got that and that's
[1:17:50] exactly what the devil will do but
[1:17:51] brother get a fellowship with the Lord
[1:17:54] and it'll change the way you view
[1:17:55] everything every perception will change
[1:17:58] around your life you'll see everything
[1:18:00] differently you know God's good brother
[1:18:03] M says and you think on this you know
[1:18:05] that you love him well I know
[1:18:08] that but how he loves
[1:18:11] you can I just say this he loves me cuz
[1:18:13] he said
[1:18:17] so listen it's not because the sun
[1:18:20] shines for me it's cuz he said so cuz
[1:18:23] tomorrow it'll get cloud
[1:18:26] you don't know how powerful these
[1:18:28] thoughts are you don't realize the depth
[1:18:30] of this it's not a cloudy Sky that's not
[1:18:33] a sign of God's disapproval nor is a
[1:18:35] sunny sign I was dedicating the church
[1:18:37] one time and it was down in the area
[1:18:39] North Carolina these they's got to be 35
[1:18:41] churches in that General region I used
[1:18:43] to stay in the hotel and preach for six
[1:18:45] churches same
[1:18:48] Hotel preached the same sermon they
[1:18:50] loved it just Believers you know all a
[1:18:53] bunch of believers they just different
[1:18:54] churches it's okay I don't mind but they
[1:18:56] was dedicating a new one one of our
[1:18:58] friends was Bill M man we was we went
[1:19:00] down and helped him dedicate it and I
[1:19:01] got in the middle of the dedic just
[1:19:02] walked out to dedicate it and the lights
[1:19:04] went
[1:19:05] off and I could hear it I'm not trying
[1:19:08] to say I got a gift I'm just telling you
[1:19:10] sometimes I can hear you thought but I
[1:19:12] could hear it oh God didn't want a
[1:19:14] church here dedicating the lights turn
[1:19:17] off God didn't want a church here and
[1:19:19] all of a sudden I could feel the
[1:19:21] pressure of that coming and you know
[1:19:22] what happened right out of my soul come
[1:19:25] something cloudy skies are not a sign of
[1:19:28] God's disapproval and it killed that
[1:19:30] devil right there just killed him
[1:19:33] dead the lights are on or the lights are
[1:19:35] off who
[1:19:39] cares I got money in my pocket or I
[1:19:41] don't who
[1:19:42] cares listen that has nothing to do with
[1:19:45] God's love for me he loved me because he
[1:19:47] said he loved me God so loved the world
[1:19:50] he gave his only begotten son he come
[1:19:53] all the way from Heaven just for you
[1:19:55] that trumps every trial that trumps
[1:19:57] every problem he died for
[1:20:01] me how can I ignore that and say well I
[1:20:04] had a flat tire God must not love me and
[1:20:07] deny his
[1:20:10] death of course he loves you he said he
[1:20:14] loves you and when you begin to meditate
[1:20:16] upon this you begin to find the power of
[1:20:19] that meditation you find the power
[1:20:21] because the angel begins to visit you
[1:20:24] and when when he begins to visit you he
[1:20:26] reminds you of the power of those
[1:20:28] Miracles that he works in your life
[1:20:30] listen I know I know how the devil Works
[1:20:32] yes sure you need a miracle but God will
[1:20:34] do it
[1:20:36] tomorrow isn't that it you believe he
[1:20:38] does Miracles but he's going to do it
[1:20:39] tomorrow he's going to do it for
[1:20:41] somebody else he's going to do it next
[1:20:42] week he's going to do it in a month
[1:20:44] God's going to do a miracle but it's
[1:20:45] going to be later do you know the way
[1:20:47] that you perform a miracle how many
[1:20:48] knows you can perform Miracles yeah come
[1:20:51] on come on you may teach you how I'll
[1:20:54] teach you you how right now cuz I got a
[1:20:55] word on it I tell you how you perform a
[1:20:58] miracle brother Bram said what Mary did
[1:21:01] is she took the word and never waited
[1:21:04] for any evidence from anybody
[1:21:07] else she took the word in the channel of
[1:21:10] faith and never waited for anybody
[1:21:13] else's word she never went and ask
[1:21:15] anybody else what do you think about
[1:21:17] this how do you feel do you think this
[1:21:19] is possible do you think this could be
[1:21:20] what do you think this amen she said be
[1:21:22] it unto me according to Thy Word and
[1:21:24] brother she didn't let the she didn't
[1:21:26] let the testimony get cold she didn't
[1:21:28] wait a week before she told somebody she
[1:21:30] didn't wait for doctor's reports or
[1:21:32] pregnancy reports or nothing else she
[1:21:34] ran down to Elizabeth's house and begin
[1:21:36] to tell that I expecting a child brother
[1:21:39] Bram said in the face of all criticisms
[1:21:42] she just started praising God anyhow and
[1:21:45] he said that's exactly what the Church
[1:21:46] of the Living God ought to begin to do
[1:21:49] is praise God before you have the
[1:21:52] evidence you say oh brother Wayne I
[1:21:54] don't know if we are to testify because
[1:21:56] I don't know if I'm Healed yet you were
[1:21:58] healed that day on Calvary when 39
[1:22:01] Stripes is put into his body I don't
[1:22:03] know what your feeling is I don't know
[1:22:06] what your situation is but I know what
[1:22:08] he did at
[1:22:11] Calvary listen you got every right as a
[1:22:16] Christian to confess whatever God paid
[1:22:19] for is
[1:22:20] yours you got a right to begin this and
[1:22:23] take the word of God and start rejoicing
[1:22:25] that is the way Miracles are performed
[1:22:27] directly that is the way Miracles are
[1:22:29] performed when you took God's word and
[1:22:31] begin to believe for the impossible you
[1:22:34] begin to take promises amen and call
[1:22:36] them present tense I know you think
[1:22:38] about waiting but listen hope is
[1:22:40] something that Waits faith is something
[1:22:42] that believes it's now Faith is what
[1:22:45] gets a hold of the word and says it's
[1:22:46] already happened it's happened right see
[1:22:49] Faith takes over in the place of hope
[1:22:51] and then you begin to call it present
[1:22:53] tense it already belongs ons to me
[1:22:56] that's what that's what happens when God
[1:22:57] begins to fail see it changes it changes
[1:23:00] your view of things now I can give you
[1:23:03] scripture on that for the Bible says if
[1:23:05] if you if you say to this mountain be
[1:23:07] moved don't doubt in your heart shall be
[1:23:08] moved but then read the verse after it
[1:23:11] it said when you begin to pray believe
[1:23:13] that you have it and you shall watch two
[1:23:17] two two different phrases When you pray
[1:23:20] believe that you receive them brother
[1:23:21] Bram said There It Is call it present te
[1:23:24] T he said and ye shall there's your
[1:23:27] future tense yeah if you start right now
[1:23:31] in present tense you'll have it in
[1:23:33] future tense but if you wait for it to
[1:23:36] change you won't never get it the Bible
[1:23:39] said he's the high priest of our
[1:23:40] confession you said preacher are you
[1:23:42] building false hope I am not I am
[1:23:44] building solidly upon the Eternal Word
[1:23:46] of almighty God it is proven and
[1:23:49] Vindicated and I am a personal witness
[1:23:51] that it
[1:23:53] works I was just reading this morning
[1:23:55] about this God and I was reading how
[1:23:57] that in brother Bam's own Ministry and
[1:23:59] how he he went he went into a an area
[1:24:02] and he prophesied you you know this one
[1:24:04] but I I just I thought it was so amazing
[1:24:06] and he prophesies over a woman remember
[1:24:08] she has an ulcer and her friend actually
[1:24:10] has a gerer on her neck yeah and he says
[1:24:13] that the Lord spoke and said thus sayith
[1:24:15] the Lord you're healed and they went
[1:24:17] home and brother B said when they got
[1:24:20] home he says now her husband was a
[1:24:22] Christian too
[1:24:24] but when this woman got to
[1:24:28] testifying he said the neighbors begin
[1:24:30] to talk about
[1:24:32] her and said now wait a minute you're
[1:24:35] going to bring a reproach on the name of
[1:24:37] the Lord you better be careful and
[1:24:40] brother Bram says see but she said look
[1:24:44] I taped that tape and it was not him
[1:24:48] that said that part it was the Lord that
[1:24:51] spoke to me
[1:24:56] so she kept with
[1:24:59] it she kept with it you know why she
[1:25:01] kept with it cuz she knew was talking to
[1:25:03] her she kept with it you know what
[1:25:06] that's a whole takee perseverance right
[1:25:08] perseverance is because you keep with it
[1:25:11] you stay with it it's hard but you stay
[1:25:13] with it it's trouble but you stay with
[1:25:14] it you stay with it when they laugh at
[1:25:16] you you stay with it when people make
[1:25:18] fun of you but you stay with it cuz you
[1:25:20] know God's talked to you and brother B
[1:25:22] says it like this and one morning he
[1:25:24] says the children went to school and her
[1:25:26] husband went to work and she was a
[1:25:28] washing
[1:25:29] dishes I thought I'd shout myself out
[1:25:32] the office when I read
[1:25:34] that you mean tell me this
[1:25:37] woman is just washing
[1:25:40] dishes and she just meditating on that
[1:25:43] meeting and what God said to her and
[1:25:46] brother Brandon says she was standing
[1:25:47] there washing dishes and all at once
[1:25:50] this real cool feeling just went over
[1:25:52] her and she never thought nothing about
[1:25:55] it but in just a moment she got real
[1:26:00] hungry she you you
[1:26:02] see she just stayed with it listen this
[1:26:05] gets close even in your home brother
[1:26:08] Bram said her husband said to her honey
[1:26:10] I don't mind you having faith but you're
[1:26:13] bringing a reproach upon the very cause
[1:26:15] of
[1:26:16] Christ how that how little brother Bram
[1:26:19] said did that husband know you can't do
[1:26:21] that when you're confessing the word of
[1:26:23] God right how little did that man know
[1:26:26] you can't do that when you're telling
[1:26:28] them the word of
[1:26:29] God brother Bram is is is takes it to a
[1:26:32] to a man with pausy and brother R says
[1:26:35] he prayed for this man and somebody was
[1:26:37] telling him about it and he said the
[1:26:38] fellow just he said he was under this py
[1:26:40] and said he he prophesied over him told
[1:26:42] him he was healed he said he went back
[1:26:44] home and he said it was weeks and weeks
[1:26:46] later and he said this man was telling
[1:26:48] the whole Community how he was healed
[1:26:50] and they kept coming to him and kept
[1:26:52] saying to him but you're a reproach to
[1:26:53] the cause of Christ you still shaking
[1:26:55] and you're saying you're healed and
[1:26:58] brother mam said that he said that the
[1:26:59] man said but wait a minute you wasn't in
[1:27:01] that
[1:27:02] meeting he said you didn't see the blind
[1:27:04] eyes were opening in that meeting I seen
[1:27:07] cripples get up and walk and that same
[1:27:09] man that said thus say the Lord turned
[1:27:10] and looked at me and said I was healed
[1:27:13] and I believe
[1:27:14] him and they said well what about that
[1:27:16] shaking he said he don't have anything
[1:27:18] to do with it and that's the key that's
[1:27:22] the key point it don't have nothing to
[1:27:24] do with it when you visit with the angel
[1:27:27] nothing else matters it don't matter if
[1:27:29] your body's still sick you can say thank
[1:27:31] God I'm Healed if you're still hurting
[1:27:34] you're still healed because your
[1:27:36] confession changes to what he tells you
[1:27:39] you know I I had a personal I had a
[1:27:41] personal uh if you heard this testimony
[1:27:43] forgive me for telling it again but I
[1:27:44] had a personal personal happening where
[1:27:47] a lady in our church brother Vern and
[1:27:48] them knew her sister Dena and she had a
[1:27:51] stroke she came to church and she come
[1:27:53] up on a Sunday morning morning and her
[1:27:55] hand was pulled like this in her leg and

[1:27:59] she was just dragging the foot and she
[1:28:00] was just doing this she come up right
[1:28:01] here and I come over there and she said
[1:28:03] brother Wayne she said would you pray
[1:28:04] for me God heal me this stroke and I
[1:28:07] said sister Dena I certainly will and I
[1:28:09] prayed for her and when I got done I
[1:28:11] said now go confess that you've been
[1:28:12] healed she said she said son she her and
[1:28:15] I were real close she's such a lovely
[1:28:17] lady she said to me she said she said

[1:28:21] nurse and the moment that I go go home

[1:28:40] live I'll never forget it she come back
[1:28:43] up that same aisle I was actually
[1:28:44] sitting over on the side another brother
[1:28:46] was preaching from out of town and when
[1:28:47] I seen her coming I thought wonder what
[1:28:49] she's W so I got up and went to the
[1:28:52] platform hold and I picked up a mic just
[1:28:54] like this one and I went to the platform
[1:28:56] and I said sister Dena what do you want
[1:28:58] and I thought she was going to want to

[1:29:38] you'd feel like dancing too matter of
[1:29:41] fact sometimes I feel like dancing
[1:29:43] anyhow just thinking about the glory of
[1:29:46] God that come upon that
[1:29:49] woman because my God is a god of
[1:29:51] Miracles
[1:29:54] that's the same God brother Vernon

[1:29:59] had an aphb he couldn't go to Australia
[1:30:01] me and Bethy he's going to Australia he
[1:30:02] couldn't go with us cuz apib I went down
[1:30:04] and spent a week with him and he said
[1:30:06] couldn't he couldn't get down the hall
[1:30:08] anybody ever had apib around him by a he
[1:30:11] couldn't get down the hall he just his
[1:30:13] heart rate would just do this dropped
[1:30:14] down probably in the 30s didn't he and
[1:30:16] he couldn't hard to get around he was
[1:30:17] dizzy and he set in the chair had that
[1:30:19] aib going and me and him we got to talk
[1:30:22] in one day and I I said brother Vernon I
[1:30:25] had this shoulder that I messed up
[1:30:27] lifting weights and I said I couldn't
[1:30:29] even lift two lbs with it and I said one
[1:30:31] morning I decided I was going to get
[1:30:33] this thing prayed for and which Aston
[1:30:36] knows I mean he was trying to get me to
[1:30:37] get an MRI and he's like
[1:30:40] Wayne and nor I'm not against
[1:30:44] that I'm really not but but something in
[1:30:48] me I felt like if they operated my
[1:30:50] shoulder would never be the same again
[1:30:51] that's way I felt my heart and so I got
[1:30:54] to pray and and I picked up some
[1:30:56] scriptures on Psalms 102 for I am the
[1:30:58] Lord that Health all thy diseases and I
[1:31:01] found it over in the book of Peter for
[1:31:02] he has healed Us by his stripes we are
[1:31:05] healed in Isaiah 53 and I seen it in
[1:31:06] James 5 and I picked up them scriptures
[1:31:09] and y'all may think I'm crazy but I'd
[1:31:11] take a walk in the morning and I'd move
[1:31:13] my arm like this and I'd say in the name
[1:31:15] of Jesus he is the Lord that Health all
[1:31:18] my diseases he's the one that created
[1:31:20] this body Satan in the name of Jesus God
[1:31:23] God created this shoulder and this this
[1:31:26] went on for months for mon I listen I'd
[1:31:29] wake up middle night if I moved my
[1:31:30] sheets and there's no way I drove with
[1:31:32] this hand couldn't happen I I carried
[1:31:36] that thing around and kind of hid it a
[1:31:37] little bit and one night I was preaching
[1:31:38] Tim PR's camp meetings and it was in
[1:31:41] that may meeting down in that building
[1:31:42] and I was preaching spirit of God was
[1:31:44] moving and it felt just like somebody
[1:31:46] walked up with their pointing finger and
[1:31:48] stuck me right in the shoulder blade and
[1:31:50] I felt that thing pop like that and I
[1:31:52] threw my shoulder back and I I kind of
[1:31:54] covered over brother Carri you know how
[1:31:55] you do when you're preaching you don't
[1:31:56] let everybody know what's happening and
[1:31:58] so I just kept on preaching and I'm
[1:31:59] walking around like and it's killing me
[1:32:01] I mean there's a pain running down and I
[1:32:03] was thinking Devil's saying to you you
[1:32:04] barely messed that thing up now you're
[1:32:06] messed up you ain't going to get out of
[1:32:07] this building so I I I got through the
[1:32:09] meeting and I'm walking out the door and
[1:32:11] I'm kind of feel funny my shoulder feels
[1:32:13] funny and I'm walking out the door I
[1:32:15] thought de Lord what have I done to my
[1:32:16] shoulder and the Lord spoke to me and he
[1:32:18] said it's your
[1:32:21] healing you know what I did I went home
[1:32:24] and I started taking a couple pounds and
[1:32:25] moving it and then I started taking
[1:32:26] about four lbs and moving then I started
[1:32:28] taking 50 lbs and moving it then I
[1:32:29] started taking 100 lb and moving it and
[1:32:31] you know what happened day by day that
[1:32:33] shoulder repaired and you know and if I
[1:32:37] wasn't getting older I could still just
[1:32:38] lift just as much as
[1:32:41] ever it didn't happen in a
[1:32:45] day but God changed it that
[1:32:48] moment you say it wasn't a miracle it
[1:32:50] was to
[1:32:51] me somebody changed me something blood
[1:32:54] don't run in your shoulder folks if you
[1:32:57] got a tore rotor cuff you just got a
[1:32:58] tore rotor cuff unless you fellowship
[1:33:01] with that angel then the one that made
[1:33:03] the rotor cuff can repair the rotor
[1:33:08] cuff we talk like that amen and a couple
[1:33:11] weeks they scheduled him a heart surgery
[1:33:13] to fix that and and so we went over

[1:33:17] went down to the back room and they took
[1:33:18] him in the back and they shaved his
[1:33:20] chest and everything had him laying
[1:33:21] there and I walked in there with him and
[1:33:23] we was going to pray with him to get it
[1:33:24] over and and while he's laying in there
[1:33:27] they they couldn't get the apib to work
[1:33:28] so then they inject medicine you know

[1:33:32] make it work and they couldn't make it
[1:33:33] work and they kept doing it kept doing
[1:33:35] it and after a while they just looked at
[1:33:36] him and said sir I'm sorry we just can't
[1:33:37] perform this surgery do you know what he
[1:33:40] ain't never had that
[1:33:44] surgery you know
