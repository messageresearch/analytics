========================================

The Book of Luke if we could turn there in the Book of Luke in the 17th chapter of Luke very familiar scripture to us as message Believers and I just think it's a u a powerful scripture Luke 17 and verse 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drink they married wives they were given in marriage until the day Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted and they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained down fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may God just add His blessings as you're seated this morning I'd like to um um speak to you this morning just for a few minutes and I know that time is precious but amen we'd like to um maybe by God's help give you something to take home with you and amen I I'd like to title it the Keystone of the Bible and I'm going to take that out of a a quote that the prophet um had um had said in the church age book and he said in order for you to fully understand the message of the church ages I would like to explain the various principles that allowed me to arrive to the names of The Messengers the length of the ages and other factors that were involved therein since this study was to be um the most serious one I'd ever undertaken up until this time I sought God for many days for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and then only did I read the scriptures on the church ages and into many Church histories written by the most unbiased historians that I could find and God did not fail to answer my prayer for while I read the word and the histories I was enabled by the Holy Spirit to see unfolded a pattern that runs through the centuries right into this present last day the key that was given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messengers for each age is a most scriptural one in fact it could be called the Keystone of the Bible it's the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are just as unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8 it says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that Ecclesiastes 3:14 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever and nothing can be to to put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which has been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is pass here it is brother BR said the an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he'll have to keep on doing until it's done for the last time there will never be a change he said you can apply that to the church ages and the kind of man that God would choose for the first age and how that God manifested in that man's Ministry it would be the example for all other ages what God did in the First Church ages what he wants to do in all the other ages amen now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first or the original church was founded and how that God manifested himself in her the word cannot change or be changed because the word is God Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God to change one word of it as Eve did brings uh sin and death even as it said in Revelations 22:18 if a man shall add unto these things God will add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholar says God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages closed how many beli that's the truth this morning amen so there's only one pattern to the true church and that is the original church that was founded by God himself listen friends the way that God started that church and what God did in that church is what God desired to continue to do until the Gentile dispensation come to an end is that right amen listen friends and we know amen by that pattern that that church amen was not started by man and neither was it governed by men amen but it was started by the Holy Ghost amen then it was governed by the Holy Ghost is that right amen do you believe it this morning amen and listen friends no man started that fire amen God himself started that fire is that right amen and the church amen was founded on the unadulterated word of God Amen do you believe that amen and that original church amen the Bible says that they amen tried them that called themselves Apostles and found them to be liars and brother Brown said oh amen what what what boldness is that and how that amen what right would they have as a congregation to try the the ministry he said but see it wasn't that they were trying them amen no he said amen they were trying them by the word see amen and they took every Ministry amen every Ministry that they heard they took it back to the word amen and if that Minister wasn't saying what the word said amen that brother R said they stood there and said amen you are a false amen you're a false anointed one because you're not saying what Paul said listen friends I tell you what amen that's the way the church started and that's the way it's going to end somebody's going to rise up in this day amen somebody's going to take start taking every minute Min amen everything you hear amen everything you feel take it back to the word of God and I say this without apology this morning if they're not saying what William random said they're false anointed ones in the end time I don't care how anointed they are I don't care how good it sounds if it don't line up with the word of God if it don't line up with the message of the hour amen it is [Music] false hallelujah it's the Keystone of the Bible now as we think think about this amen what is the Keystone is is the Revelation that God never changes numbers 23 and 19 God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent amen hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and it shall not make it good amen Malachi 3 and 6 for I am the Lord and I change not Amen in the Book of Psalms in Psalms 102 of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the the heavens are the work of thy hands they Shall Perish but thou shal endure yeah all of them shall wax old like a garment and as a vesture Thou shalt change them but and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy years shall have no End Amen listen friends that's the god that we're serving this morning amen God is unchangeable listen it is not that God it's not that we're saying this morning that God has never changed as if he could you see what I'm saying you can say something that amen you know it's just always been the same it's never changed but but that's that's different than something being immutable because amen immutable is something that cannot be changed see and that's God God it's not just that the the fact that he's never changed amen but the fact is he cannot change and he cannot be changed man brother bar would say it this way he said I thank you Father that you remain the same God that you ever was you're still just the same we change ages change CH time change people change but you never change your systems are the same Your Grace is the same your works are the same because they are marvelous and and your ways are past any knowledge of a man to ever understand Amen in the evening messenger he said now notice you people all must remember this that God cannot change he's an unchangeable God see times change people change but God is infinite he cannot change he must remain the same yesterday today and forever amen he must always remain and if you believe this to be the word of God we can put our confidence amen we can put our confidence amen how many believes this but that's why we can put our confidence in God because he can't change now you see amen there there's how his message comes he s his message he can't change that he's always done it he's always has to remain the same and that's the way that he'll always do it now you see what brother R saying the way he did it is the way he'll always do it do you realize that's how we know that if God's going to send a message in this last day he's going to use a prophet amen because listen friends it's got to line up with a pattern of the scripture amen God don't do nothing unless he reveals it to Amen to His prophets first is that right so if God was going to amen give a message in this last day he would have to use a prophet because that amen is his unchanging method hallelujah amen he says in the identified Christ of all the ages he said the unchangeable god with an unchangeable character and his unchangeable characteristics must remain the same he cannot change his characteristic he cannot do it anything is known by his characteristics God is known by his characteristic right Amen in the Mighty God unveil brother and said in God what he does he just he just changes himself to become that or or or or to become to that generation to make himself known to that people now listen what how he said he changes himself but he's not changing his nature he's not changing his characteristics he's changing his mask see amen and he's doing it for the purpose to make himself known to that people and that's what we're here to find out tonight is what the way is God is supposed to make himself known to the people Amen in this time see he changes his mask he changes his act but he don't change his disposition he doesn't change his nature he just changes his mask from one to another he does it amen to reveal himself more plain to the people that they might know who he is and what he is I think this is beautiful because you got to catch this Revelation this is in fact the Keystone of the Bible and when you begin to realize that God has made known by his characteristics then you'll be able to see God no matter what form he appears in see it don't matter what body God is using you can know if it's God or Not by the characteris Mystics Hallelujah come on church amen listen for amen whether it's in a pillar of fire or was in the man Jesus it was the same characteristics amen and whether it was in the man Jesus or in the man William random it was the same characteristics and whether it was in I hope you can follow me in this whether it was in William random or in you it's the same characteristics hallelujah amen but because God is made known by his characteristics it's by his [Applause] nature you believe it amen it's the Keystone revelation of the Bible God don't never change see and that's how you'll know if it's God so brother Ram would say I in the in the in the message souls in prison he said Jesus said as the father sent me so send I you and the father sent him to preach to the living to those who had hope and then presented the same message to those who had no hope it seems fitting at this time that will have to be done because the spirit of Christ Living in us the spirit of Christ Living in US does not change the nature of him or it doesn't change God's system he must be the same in every generation he must be the same as the father sent me so send I you amen I I think that's a beautiful quote he must be the same in every generation listen friends this is a different generation and these are different times you're living in a different world Amen than even what brother brandham lived in but there's something that has remained and that's the characteristics of God the nature of God and whether amen it was in that generation or this gener it don't change God's nature or his characterist amen you say brother Josh what are you trying to say I'm trying to tell you this whatever the Holy Ghost done in Paul and Peter and James and John if it's the same Holy Ghost it'll do the same thing in you that it did in them hallelujah amen I'm glad to be able to tell you this morning I got the same holy ghost that Peter James and John got I got the same holy ghost in me that William random had and brother whatever it did in them it'll do the same thing in me amen and I tell you what it did in them just the shadow of them Apostles amen as it covered over the sick they were healed Hallelujah do you believe it and listen friends you ain't got a different Holy Ghost you got the same Holy Ghost doing the same thing if it change him it'll change you hallelujah oh you believe it so now watch he said in the kingsman Redeemer he said them Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that with all your heart how many you believe that with all your heart he is the same do you believe that Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever that means that he's actually the same how is he the same he's the same in every principle he's the same God the same healer the same savior he's got the same attitude Hallelujah that's all the same is it right amen then if he it was the same and is the same he'll do and act the same how many knows that to be the truth because he's immutable see he's unchangeable immutable means something that cannot be transposed it's something that's fixed it's it can't be altered cannot be changed it's unchanging over time it's unable to be changed that's why in Hebrews 6 we were there the other night amen that that the Bible says for when God May promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself listen friends what what what's that scripture really talking about because men you know when they make a promise because we are men and we're human amen then that we actually have the ability to to to promise something and then fail to carry it out see amen men have the ability to to even with good intentions sometimes you may give a promise but then you are unable to keep your promise amen and so amen that's why men will swear an oath by something greater than what they are amen because they're trying to give a confidence amen or a confirmation behind the promise that they made amen what that's why they're swearing to something greater or by something greater than what they are see amen I might fail but that can't fail I might fail but that's why they have men lay their hands on the Bible in the court of law because they know a man can lie amen but they used to have an understanding that this can't lie so they made them swear by something greater than what they were amen that there might be a confidence in what they were saying but when God got ready to make an oath with Abraham he looked all over the Earth amen he looked and searched for something greater that he could swear by but because there was nothing greater he swore by himself Hallelujah you know what that tells me friends that the promise of God is just as sure as the nature of God hallelujah and his word is just as un un changeable as he is I ask you the questions can God fail neither can his word now look because cuz brother Brown said I feel religious I feel I feel it too he said I feel religious when I think about Abraham knowing that what he that that we can be his seed how many believes you're Abraham see through Christ and all these promises not only to make it sure God held up his hand and swore by himself that he would do it the oath always the Covenant is confirmed by an oath and God swore by himself cuz there was no h to swear by he swore by himself that he would do it and now what the world how what's a matter with us such a promise as that a faith buil around something like like that a faith a word that promised these things in the last days and here we see it happening right before us and we're still stooping around and calling oursel Abraham seed what's brother BR saying amen listen for amen we're not just following just a a better idea come on Friends amen we got a more sure word of Prophecy in this hour amen and God is Not only promised his word but he's also confirmed it by an oath and proved to be to be true amen and the prophet of God say with the faith anchored on a word like that how can we ever fail amen how amen it would be a sin for us to doubt the word of God at this time it is because God not only said it but he confirmed it and he proved it to be true in this [Applause] day is what the what is the Bible going to say for men barely swear by the greater for an oath of confirmation is to them the end of all Strife you know what that means means it's the the the the the dispute is over it's the end of the argument but I I I I feel like stopping right here for a minute and just tell the devil stff the dispute is over we are not here disputing whether the message is right or could we trust it or we can't trust it the we're not here to argue that point this morning the dispute is Over The Strife has ended because God has confirmed is worth amen and listen friends amen it has been amen God has promised amen and made an oath with us to and prooved it to be exactly the truth and that confirmation is the end of The Strife watch where in God more willing are willing more abundantly to show Into The Heirs of the promise of IM imitability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath by two immutable things or unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie how many thankful for that listen friends God cannot lie am meant two immutable things what is these things the promise and the oath it's unchangeable Amen it's impossible for God to lie amen that should give us an absolute Assurance on and listen friends amen about the reliability of God's word and his promise friends if God said he's going to do something he's going to do it and God said I'm going to have a bride and she's going to be without spot and without wrinkle Hallelujah I'm going to have a virgin bride a virgin of my word I'm going to have a church in the end time Hallelujah that's going to be a holy ghost filled church amen that's going to be clothed in the beauty of Holiness amen I'm going to have Overcomers amen God has said it and God will do it you say brother I'm having a hard time seeing it well I'll just tell you God is able of these stones to raise up children under Abraham Hallelujah he still Jehovah Gyra where there ain't no squirrels he can create squirrels do believe it amen listen friends and I tell you this amen there's a lot of people coming they've gone amen but God said I'm going to have a bride somebody's going to believe the message amen and if they won't do it I'll raise up a bunch of young people in 2024 amen and I'll put a faith in their heart hallelujah amen men have took and they debated a message and they made weapons out of it and they div and build kingdoms amen but God said I'm going to have a bride I don't care how bad it gets or how bad it looks somebody is going to believe that message and I believe I'm looking at some young people hallelujah listen R amen and we amen listen we ain't circling the mountain no more like brother Andrew preach last night we're going over we're all the promises of God our reality Hallelujah God is obligated to his word he's obligate God keeps his word did you know that brother Brown said he said if you ever get that settled in a man you're going to go somewhere he said most of you get that he said let that drop down in here and let it let this down here say it's right and then I don't care what anything says different it'll never change your course he said oh you're heading out in the deep water then listen what he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said let's watch the manifestation as soon as he started his public Ministry watch what brother saying if you can follow he's talking about Christ his public Ministry and see and see what he did yesterday he will be the same today you believe that if we find out what he done yesterday to manifest himself as a messiah or you say uh you may may I say that again amen he said for here hangs the campaign there hangs the keynote there hangs the thing that will shake the there hangs a one alls sufficient thing what he was he is hallelujah there hangs the key note he called it the Keystone Revelation now he says the key note to the campaign amen there hangs the thing that will shake the nation amen then what the what did the prophet say what he was he is say brother what do you mean by that I'm telling you if he was a savior he is a savior if he was a deliverer he is a deliverer if he was a Healer He Is A Healer hallelujah amen I got something to encourage you with this morning if he did it for one and he is just the prophet of God said if you meet the same requirements then God is obligated to do for you you what he did for them oh come on church I tell you what you need to do this morning amen get your Bible out and find somebody in this Bible that you can identify with and then you look amen you look over there and you read about sham guard and you said oh God if you did it for him and if you're the same God this morning you got to do it for me Hallelujah read about Samson amen and he say oh God if you did it for him you got to do it for me read about David and if you did it for him you got to do it for me Hallelujah because whatever he was he is we ain't serving the god of the I was or the god of the I will be he's the god of the I am Hallelujah you believe it the prophet of God said if he is the same and how many can say amen he is then we should sell out and surrender everything to him all our motives all our objectives amen our will amen that we should surrender to him do you believe that now as we just turn a little bit of a corner now amen the Prophet said all scripture has compound meanings and it runs in cycles for instance he said over there in Matthew I believe it was out of Egypt I'll call my son and now the scripture that Matthew was referring to really was pertaining to Israel and God said out of Egypt I'll call my son Israel and he called Israel his son out but it also meant Jesus see out of out of Egypt I call my son see how it routines back the cycle of time swings it back ever so often and history repeats itself and scripture repeats itself down through the age any scholar knows that that's ever studied it from the scriptural standpoint to watch how that scripture will repeat itself it runs in Cycles like that it certainly does another place what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ brother B said you see nature in history repeats itself because nature continues the same trees will continue to grow vegetables will come flowers uh the World Turns just like it always did it's nature see and the nature of each age produces again and reproduces the reflection of what a nature was before them and today we find ourselves again standing on that same place so now brother BR is saying that the nature of the age will run in a cycle and he said you'll find yourself because n uh history repeats itself nature repeats itself and he said even the scriptures see amen the the the the prophecy will will will come around in another cycle and he said and you'll find yourself standing again so in other words what's he trying to show you he's trying to show you that that's why you can go back in the Bible amen and God laid things in this Bible that would be a type of where you're standing at now and then by that whatever God did then you can expect God to do the same thing [Applause] now watch this it's powerful because brother bam says he takes and he begin to tell us how many knows that God would use the spirit of Elijah five times now how do we know it's Elijah's Ministry by the characteristics of it I think this is very powerful things with brother Brown amen even uses this same Keystone Revelation to identify the two witnesses of Revelations 11 he identified who they were by their characteristics of their Ministry even you know brother Brown said it had to be Moses and Elijah because look what they done amen they interrupted nature turned the water into blood and amen shut up the Heavens For he said who did that before so he took the characteristic of the ministry amen and identified amen the the ministry of the end time because of what they had already done oh friends I hope you understand when I say do you know it was the same way that brother Brenham was able to identify the souls under the altar he said they couldn't be bride he said cuz look what they're doing they're crying out for vengeance he said that can't be bride amen because the bride would have the same spirit in them that Christ had in him when he was hanging on the cross and he said father forgive and then he proved it amen because when they were stoning Steven because he had the same Holy Ghost the life that was in Christ was now in Sten he said oh Father forgive them and brother Brown said the bride will have that same forgiveness come on Young people I'm giving you a keystone to identify every Ministry every church you can identify the Bride of Jesus Christ by the characteristics I tell you what if there's hatred amen and Malice amen and all kind of mean Spirit coming out that is not the spirit of Christ identified by the [Applause] characteristic brother said that's it see them Souls Under The Altar and the still that's some Jews cuz listen they stood for the testimony of the word of God but not of Jesus Christ they're crying out for that so by that same I think it's so beautiful because it was by that that that that that uh Keystone Revelation that he identified the messenger of of the ages you know what brother Brown said he did it because whichever one was a closest to having the same uh uh quality in their Ministry that was in the Apostle Paul's that was a messenger to the age is that right so watch this because amen that's how we can identify the ministry of Elijah I'm just get I'm going to tell you amen I I come to these meetings to Amen to to to cut the devil up so because the devil's are coming on now trying to amen trying to to tell some of our young people and even some of our old people that William Brandon was not the Elijah that was promised in Malachi 4 and they're trying to come and discredit and discredit and tear down the ministry of William randam and say it could not be he could not be that fulfillment but I tell you what I've done amen I've checked it by the characteristics and the problem is is I already got three examples in this Bible of what the ministry of Elijah would do come on church I tell you what when Elijah come he stood there and with stood that Jezebel [Music] religion Hallelujah he wasn't a jellyfish weak back Christian he stood right there in the face of all adversity and with stood stood that Jezebel religion and I say this William random amen did exactly the same thing and the second time God used the ministry of Elijah was in Elisha and Elisha was a man that was conscious of two Dimensions amen he can stand in this world and be conscious of two dimensions and tell you what you couldn't see in another dimension I checked the minister of William random by the example laying in the scripture and I tell you by the characteristics of his ministry I declare to you amen he is the anti Elijah of Malachi [Music] 4 come on Friends what do he say about John the Baptist John the Baptist was a man of the Wilderness come stoning out of the Wilderness even eating Locust and wild honey and he walked right up to Herod and said it ain't lawful for you to have your brother's wife come on is he didn't back down on nothing amen he didn't he didn't come to tickle their ears he said the axe is laid to the root of the tree amen and what did he do he went as a forerunner forerunning the very coming of the Lord but I want to tell you there was a voice down on the old high river that spoke one day and said as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ so will your message for and the second listen friend I checked it by the the characteristics of it and the ministry matches I tell that devil this morning you come too late tell me that William Brandon was not the Elijah of Malachi 4 but brother I want to tell you this amen if there's an Elijah there got to be somebody that their heart is going to be turned by that message oh I want to preach right now amen I ain't got the voice to do it but I want to tell you if there's a jezebel and there is and there's an Ahab and there he is amen if there's a jezebel there's got to be an Elijah but brother if there's an Elijah there's got to be 7,000 some where that's never bow the knee to bail there's got to be somebody that's got their name on the last book of life before the foundation of the world if there's an Elijah there's got to be somebody that's going to stand with that Elijah Hallelujah I tell you what I believe I'm looking at some of them that will not Bend we will not bow and when The Showdown come and the fire falls amen we say the Lord he is God hallelujah you believe it you know brother BR in the Feast of trumpets brother Bram was talking about them two witnesses and he said I caught that see he said he said you think it was Enoch he said because he see Elijah had never was taken into heaven in a Char he said you think it was Enoch because he never died he said but he said but no he said it had to be Moses and then he said' I'll prove it to you and then he shows Moses and Elijah standing on Mount Transfiguration and listen friends even though Moses had died amen amen the air and the angels had carried him away but listen friends amen remember brother Brown shows up very powerful he said when Moses got ready to die amen he had a place to put his foot and when he stepped from this Dimension he just stepped over onto the rock hallelujah amen and there because he died like that amen he was seen again on Mount Transfiguration amen standing there with Christ in the presence of Peter James and John Amen brother Brown says see me proves it he said it can't be Enoch that would break the pattern now brother BR remember brother brandham said said that that that early church would be the pattern or the example Paul's Ministry would be the example brother Brown said Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century he said this enables us to set the DAT to the beginning of the Ephesian Church age he said his manner of ministering set the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire to and actually set the pattern for every true minister of God though he would not obtain such Heights in the prophetic realm as did Paul Paul's Ministry had a three-fold quality and and was as follows first of all first of all Paul was absolutely true to the word he never deviated from it no matter the cost listen friend brother Brown said every true Minister will aspired to to to to to strive Amen to have these same qualities in their Min it ain't that they're trying to be like Paul or you know mimic him and in in in their in their in Charisma or in action or so forth amen but they'll have the same quality of ministry that was in the Apostle Paul and then he breaks it down in threefold he said first of all he be true to the word secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word is that right Paul said I didn't come with enticing words of men's wisdom but in the power of the Holy Ghost amen Paul amen believed amen that when the word is preached amen it would demonstrate amen how many believes that amen listen friends amen and thirdly amen Paul's Ministry would have evident fruit of a god-given Ministry in other words amen somebody when Paul preached amen there was going to be Souls one to Christ amen there was going to be fruits of his ministry come on church I'm telling you amen I'm giving you young people a key amen that you can identify between the true and the false amen first of all first and foremost amen I don't care what's going on or what's happening or what or how anointed anybody is if they're not staying true to the word that is the First Quality amen that that that that brother B put to Paul's Ministry amen they that he stood true to the word I mean knows that even our Prophet amen when he went beyond the curtain of time amen he stood there and he asked amen well Paul had to stand with his group said yes he said praise God because I preached what Paul preached Hallelujah and there was a multitude of people that begin to scream out we're resting on that Hallelujah you may call me crazy but I believe I was one of them amen and because I was one of them I'm here this morning and I'm still resting on this message I tell you why amen because I checked it with a pattern brother amen I tell you this message lines up from Genesis all the way to Revelations you know what somebody asked me one time they come and said well brother brother Josh don't you think don't you think it's possible you know that somebody could uh uh uh uh you know that we could that we could preach these things and and let's you know and and just leave brother brandham out of it I mean you know and I was listening to him for a little bit you know I was thinking you know that well we just put too much emphasis you know on the problem we just and don't you think we could just preach the Revelation just you know we ain't got to talk about the prophet and just leave brother brandom out of it and for a minute you know brother Ray I was thinking about that I thought well you know uh maybe I don't know and all of a sudden something just struck my heart I said I tell you what I believe as soon as you can tell the story about the ark and leave Noah out of it and if you can talk about Israel coming out of Egypt in an exodus and leave Moses out of it come on church if you can talk about the Earth early church and leave Paul out of it then you can talk about this end time message and the change of my body and leave brother bam out of it but brother if you going to put Noah in the story and Moses in the story and Paul in the story then why not just put brother brandom in it too brother I'm telling you amen we're not here to worship William brandom we worship Jesus Christ but William random was a a channel amen that God used Hallelujah that's how we know that Malachi 4 is not an anointing that's going to come on a group you know how we know cuz that's not what he done the first three [Applause] times and God don't change his pattern brother Braham said I want you to be very careful here and see this God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it's the spirit quick and word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it's just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be done will be in its last Church age when the messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis the revelations he'll start at the serpent sea and carry on to the messenger of the latter rain amen he will be rejected by the denominations he has to be guys because it's history repeating itself amen it's history repeating itself from the time of Ahab it's Israel's history under a Ahab happening right here in America where the prophet of Malachi appears as Israel left Egypt wor to worship and freedom pushed out the natives raised up a nation with great leaders like David Etc and then they put an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the very same in America our forefathers left for this land to Worship in and to live in Freedom they pushed back the natives they took over the land mighty men like Washington and Lincoln raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber seceded those worthy men and soon and Ahab was set in a presidential chair with a jezebel behind him to direct him it is a such a time that mount that the Mount Carmel Showdown amen will come and watch this carefully now to see in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the former he planted H the former rain and was rejected by the organization of his of of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown amen the second Forerunner of Christ will SE for the latter rain and Jesus Will will be the showdown between the denominations and the Creed for he will come to back up his word and to take his bride and a Rapture Hallelujah the first Showdown was Mount carel the second Showdown was Mount Transfiguration the third will be Mount Zion listen we are coming to the Mount Zion Showdown amen and The Showdown is this the proof of it in this time listen friends on Mount on Mount carel the fire fell on Mount Transfiguration amen he said this is my beloved Son hear ye him amen but on the mouth sign show down Jesus is going to come and take his bride in the Rapture come on friends I want to tell you something there's going to be a final proof of this message one of these mornings and it's going to be even not what I'm doing on the earth I'm not even going to be here hallelujah amen and this God is going to prove the difference between his bride and the and the church amen and the final proof is going to be the change of our bodies you believe that now look I've laid all this out and showed you because I want you to catch this as it was so shall it be as it was in the days of Sodom now Jesus in in in in Luke 17 he says as it was and in the days of lot I've always thought this was a powerful because Jesus don't say anything about Abraham but he says as it was in the days of lot and then he'll start describing the condition of the world at that time so as it was in the days of lot and then it'll describe what was going on in Sodom amen but he don't say nothing about Abraham and then he'll go and say as it was in the days of Noah amen and they were uh you know uh given in marriage and so forth and all the conditions of the world Amen at that time so shall it be so as it was so shall it be but listen friends amen I thank God for a message cuz brother Brown comes along and picks up them same scriptures amen and and it take where Jesus said as it was in the days of lot but friends you got to take it and look at the pattern look at the remember what was will be and what is has already been amen so you go back and you find your day in the scripture and Jesus said when the son of man is going to be revealed it's going to be as it was in the days of lot amen so if there's a Sodom how many believe you're living in Sodom come on friends we are not that's not something down the road we're living in the days of Sodom the world is in a Sodom condition that's not coming next week or amen let no that's where we're at at right now but if there's a Sodom there's got to be a lot and the Bible said the sins of the city Vex his righteous Soul me knows that's what the Bible says but do you know lot ain't even your [Applause] type lot is not even your type amen but I want to tell you this if there's a Sodom and there's a lot there's got to be an Abraham Hallelujah listen if there's a Sodom and there's a lot there's got to be two angels that was sent down to minister to lot and blind the eyes of the people to the door amen listen but if there is a lot and there's two angels with him there's got to be an Abraham somewhere under another Ministry God made flesh revealing the secret of the heart Hallelujah Well church I want to tell you even if there's a Lot's wife that is turning around and looking back just in a time right before the Judgment amen there's a lot wife that's looking back there's got to be a Sarah somewhere that's judging him faithful who made the promise Hallelujah I don't know about the rest of y'all but when I read that story I am not lot I am not a Lot's wife come on I'm knocked down in Sodom I'm sitting on another Mountain Hallelujah I'm fellowshipping with Elohim and while Lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt Sarah's body is being changed to receive the promised son Hallelujah listen friends amen as it was in the days of Noah amen if there's a if there's a Time on the earth that men's harder continually upon evil how many beli we're living there how how many know how many believes that's this day right now amen but listen if the world is in that condition amen and there's a Noah amen but listen friends there's got to be an Enoch come on brother Bram took the pattern and he said Enoch would not be one of them two prophets of Revelations 11 and don't fit the pattern but the same Prophet took the same pattern and said Enoch does have a type he is not typing one of them two witnesses he's typing a bride that was the seven from Adam amen that was going to go in a Rapture before the tribulation Hallelujah listen is amen if there's a Noah there's got to be an Enoch if there's a church that's going to go through the tribulation there's got to be a bride somewhere that's going in a Rapture you believe it if there's an El eer if there's an eler I'm telling you what was Will be and what is has already been and if there's an El eer there's got to be a Rebecca you can't have an elier without a Rebecca come on Church you can't have amen an end time Prophet with an end time message without having a bride debris to believe and receive that message there's got to be a Rebecca somewhere that's coming to the whale hallelujah amen there's got to be a Rebecca somewhere that's watering amen with her praise the very power that's going to carry her to meet Isaac oh I know they're going to criticize and they're going to make fun amen of all the worship that's going on in this camp but I'll just take the pattern of the word of God Amen and I will show it to you in the Bible what you're actually doing you're a Rebecca that's drawing water and you're watering the very power that's going to carry you to meet Isaac Hallelujah so I say don't let no devil take your praise away don't let no devil take your joy away water the camel [Applause] friends I could preach all day but I ain't going through but I tell you what I could because you can go back all through this Bible amen and you're going to look at the at the pattern amen you're going to see amen that Amen in every example God put you in the story if there's a Boaz there's got to be a Ruth come on friends if there's a Jericho there's got to be a RAB amen oh friends amen there's got to be an Esther somewhere amen God was right in your story if there's a Judah there's got to be a Tamar amen God was putting it all down through the scripture amen listen there's got to be a Mary somewhere that said be it unto me according to Thy word amen the prophet of God said I tell you what to do go back in the Bible and find yourself in this scripture let me just try to close with this I'm going to actually read the quote to you but brother Brown said I imagine this dear person that asked this question brother they asked brother B why that the Bible doesn't call didn't call his name the name William brandom see he said see he said now you see familiar places that refer to it in the Bible they that says certain things now if watch History repeats itself in the Bible now let's just give you a scripture for one now and he goes into Matthew 3 again and God calling his son out of Egypt and then he says now if you got a scoffield or a reference Bible you'll follow that reference there in the margin it'll bring you back when he called Jacob or Israel out of Egypt as Jacob was his son that would be caught out of e but Jesus was a son that would be caught out so the word of God is never ending see we identify ourselves in the Bible how many remembers my message of identifying yourself with the Christian characters brother R said see I preached it there in Phoenix he said many of you has got the tape on it identifying with Christian character you see you identify yourself anywhere you want to in the scripture if you're a Christian and if you're not a scripture then you identify yourself in the Bible see so I think maybe that would help and I so so brother BR what is he trying to say listen because they say you know brother BR why is your name not called you know and and it's you know I actually had somebody ask me that same question one day said well well you know if this message is what you you you claim why I didn't I know anything about it and furthermore why is brother Brown's name not in the Bible and I said it is his name is all through this Bible and so is mine come on friends so is mine and I want you to leave this this this youth meeting amen with that Revelation in your heart so is mine amen I not only see William bram's name in that scripture I see my name I'm identified under that messenger I'm identified with that messenger I tell you I'll give a I'll give you a great example of this in closing amen because there was a little woman over in Memphis one day amen she had a son that got sick God to give her that boy amen and when her son was on on the the the deathbed amen she begin to pray and you know what she did and brother Ray she went back in this Bible and she began to read and she found herself in the scripture and she began to say Lord I'm not shooting my woman I'm not shooting my woman Lord you gave me this son amen I am that shoo my woman where is your Elijah Hallelujah she found herself in the word of God and she and she knew if God is an unchanging God with unchanging ways and he is a just God and he is a faithful God Amen whatever he done for her he's got to do the same thing for me and if if you gave me a son and I'm not sh of my woman there got to be an Elijah somewhere Hallelujah and God Almighty took the faith of that woman and grounded an airplane and led a prophet of God right to her house Hallelujah and I'm going to tell you something you say your brother Josh I was a long time ago and brother B was not here well I tell you this amen get your Bible out this morning and start reading and find you a character in this Bible Hallelujah and I tell you this if God is still God and he is whatever he did then he'll do now hallelujah amen I believe with all my heart what he did for that woman in Memphis he'll do the same thing for you he'll do the same thing for me if you can identify yourself in the word of God it's the Keystone of the Bible God never changes Hallelujah and his word is just as true as he is and My Soul Is Anchored to that word Hallelujah I tell you something young people as a musicians come this morning amen I want you to leave this Camp amen and I want you to have this anchored in your heart that and please don't misund understand what I'm saying amen because I thank God for the excitement and I thank God for the worship and everything that's happened here but friends when all that is gone and the waves start battering up again against that ship I'm going to tell you you're going to leave this camp and you're going to be rolling against the current you're going to leave this camp and you're going to go back out and amen in your lives and and things are going to become normal again and you're going to be pushing against the current and and Satan's going to be fighting you and the waves are going to be crashing around you but I tell you what that's when you need strong consolation amen that Paul talked about in Hebrews 6 the strong consolation that by two immutable things God cannot lie which hope we have is an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast I'll tell you this you know when you're going against the current you ain't got to you ain't got to Road backwards to go backwards just quit just stop see because the current will take you backwards when you're going up against the currency oh and and listen you're going to get tired sometimes you get wore out the winds are going to get strong and the cells are going to break maybe even the ORS are going to snap that's when you got to have an anchor [Music] now I'm telling you this morning amen when that current starts pulling you back drop that anchor and say Lord I've come too far I fall too hard I've come too hard to drift away now and drop that anchor that anchor within the veil let it just catch on that rock that Solid Rock [Music] tie your soul to Christ brother BR said it don't

seventh seal ends all things amen it ends all the Strife it ends all the doubting it it just ends it isn't it isn't it something young people that the seventh seal has been revealed in every tith in the Bible amen and it's come to you in story form that you might be able to catch it when it was hid from the wise and prudent amen but yet it was revealed to you such as you said well my my name brother Wayne it ain't there but you know it is there amen it is there how many knows the scripture where it says amen they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of testimony y'all know what pronouns mean I know they who is They isn't it beautiful he didn't put one name there he gave they so you could be added into that group and they that same group is in Hebrews the 11th chapter when the Bible said that they speaking of the former ages cannot be made perfect without us speaking of this same group but you said brother wayang then it's just a group experience but in Revelations 3 it said he that overcometh and it takes it to a personal so here this morning personally you're in the scriptures and once you see that it is the end of The Strife because it's not just something
