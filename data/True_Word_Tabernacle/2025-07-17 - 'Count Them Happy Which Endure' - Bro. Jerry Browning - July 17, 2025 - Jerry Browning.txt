I greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Uh I uh I was talking to brother Wayne and I I'm thankful for brother Wayne uh having us come and uh thankful for brother Ray Ericson and uh actually he he's been quite influential in my life. Uh I uh Lord called me into the ministry in 1983 and uh I think I'd maybe preached one time at the church up there that my father had started and then brother Ray found out that the Lord had called me to the ministry. So he called me on the phone and asked me to come and and I I I don't remember if you were in Bluffton or Fost or Fosttori at that time. I think it might have been Fostoriia and &gt;&gt; 83 would have been Fostori. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so uh so it's the first place uh I ever went and preached when I going out. So and of course I've uh known the Ericson family for many many years. And me and I know he's here somewhere maybe tonight right back there. Ehi uh we were uh best friends and things and we still are brother. I know we don't hardly see each other, but uh you're still dear to my heart &gt;&gt; and uh and we uh so uh just uh and I'm sure there's many that I I can't place and and see that I I remember over the years things and and uh so but it's it's wonderful to be here with you tonight. And if the I was kind of feeling on my heart as coming down thinking about I was leaving from up. I'd been in brother Paula Fontaine's last night and uh I was thinking what would the Lord have me to speak on when I came and I was kind of feeling something pulled on my heart a certain way and uh so when I met with brother Wayne, brother Wayne said, "Brother, if you if you feel led of the Lord," he said, "Try to share maybe a little your testimony how God healed you." And uh so uh that was what I was actually already feeling on my heart. But when he said it, then the Lord kind of dropped a couple of scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into my heart with it. And uh so uh maybe tonight we'll we'll read a couple of scriptures and I'll speak just a little bit and then maybe the Lord will help us to share our testimony. Amen. So I want to uh read first from James chapter 5 and uh verses 7- 11. If I to title this tonight, I'd like to title it uh count them happy which endure. &gt;&gt; Count them happy which endure. Amen. Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That says a lot right there, doesn't it? That's actually where we're at right now. &gt;&gt; Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the earth, and have long patience for it, until he receiveth the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord drawth nigh. Grudge not against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned. Behold the judge standeth before the door. Take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of t tender mercy. I'd also like to read from Hebrews chapter 6 uh verses 10- uh 15. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have showed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister. And we desire that every one of you should show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope and to the end. That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherited the promises. For when God had made a promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swear by himself, saying, "Surely blessing I will bless thee, multiply, and I will multiply thee." And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. Amen. You may be seated. I want to really emphasize on this word endure here. &gt;&gt; You know, endure. It means you you're you're holding fast. &gt;&gt; You you you get a hold of uh what your your rest your faith on on the promises of God. And then no matter what's going on, no matter how you feel, no matter what affliction you're suffering, no matter what's going on, whether it's a good day, a bad day, a happy day, or a sad day, you are holding fast. &gt;&gt; Whether it's a hard day or an easy day, you're holding fast to the promises of God. Even when your body is not testifying that the that of the promise of God, but you believe and you are holding fast that God is going to bring your body into subjection and bring the promise of God about to you. Amen. Uh you know whether you need healing, whether you need the Holy Ghost, whatever you need, you know you that's a promise of God to you and you endure. You stay right there holding fast until God comes and confirms that promise in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we find here that that Abraham, brother Brennham brings this out how Abraham, he patiently endured. Hallelujah. And and you know it, brother Ram speaks about uh from Hebrews chapter 4 about holding fast to our profession. and and and he says this uh uh this first quote I want to read to you. He said, "If he's Jehovah Raphi, the healer, if he promised to heal me, I'll take him at his word. If he promised me the Holy Ghost was to me, I'll stay there till it comes. That's all." That's right. He promised it. Stay with it. Just take him at his word. Stay right there. That's the only way to do it. Brother says the thing is he says a lot of us we're afraid to testify even you know even with our faith and we're believing and you know many people think well I can't testify until it's actually happened but friends you can testify of your faith you can take a stand and testify saying I believe this look at brother Brandham when he begins to talk about John Ryan you know with the the eyes that were blind John Ryan was blind he couldn't see. But he was going around telling people, "I can see." And they say, "John, can you see today?" And he would say, "Yes, I can see. By his stripes, I'm healed." He was down on the corner passing out newspapers saying, "Extra, extra, read all about it. By his stripes, I am healed." And he was standing there just as blind as a post, but he was testifying of his faith. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what brother said? He was he was brother Random was uh referring to when David talked in in the book of Psalms uh verse, you know, in chapter 23 and and David was saying, "Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I feel no evil evil, for thou are with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they cover me." And he said, "Thou prepareest the table before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil." And brother says, "Have you ever got anointed in the presence of your enemy?" He said, "Get up and get anointed. Get in God and get anointed in the presence of your enemy and testify that his promises are real." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, faith isn't based on what you can see. That's right. &gt;&gt; It ain't fa It ain't based on what you can feel. &gt;&gt; It's based on It actually is the evidence. Just having that faith, testifying of that faith is the evidence that it exists. &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of the unseen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of of of what cannot be felt. It's the evidence of what even isn't have even manifested yet. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends. I don't see a rapture, but I can tell you this. You'll never convince me that there isn't a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember one time, you know, my dad years ago, he was testifying to his father and and he was telling him about brother Brandham, you know, speaking the squirrels into existence. And you know, my grandfather, he was actually a backsliding Pentecostal man. He had been backslid for years. But my dad was testifying, witnessing to him and and was telling about God sent a prophet and said, and he was telling about him the third pulling him speaking the squirrels into existence. &gt;&gt; My grandfather looked at him and he said, "Were you there when he spoke the squirrels into existence?" My dad said, "No." He said, "Well, then how do you know what happened?" My dad said, he said, I I I was stumped for just a moment. He said, then I asked him, I said, "Dad, you've read in the Bible where God took uh mud and put it on a blind man's eyes and to went out and washed it off and and and he seen." He goes, "Oh, yeah." He said, "Do you believe that happened?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "Were you there?" &gt;&gt; He said, "The same way you believe that happened and you know that happened, that's the same way I know this happened." &gt;&gt; What is it, France? It's it's a revelation. Brother said faith is a revelation. It's not something that you sit around and reason on and figure out. It's something that drops down in acres in your soul. And friends, you might not be able to explain it. It may not make sense to anybody else. You may not even be able to make sense of it to yourself, but it's anchored there and nothing will shake it. Now &gt;&gt; that's that is the kind of faith that God will come and honor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get anointed in your presence of your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get anointed. Amen. By the spirit of God and get up and testify right in the devil's face. Him pointing to you and saying you feel sick as a dog right now tonight. But you testify and say, "I am healed." Why can you testify that? because he said, "I am the Lord thy God that health thee." And David testified and said, "He forgiveth all of my iniquities. He health health all a double L all of my diseases." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is nothing. Think about this. Brother Random said the angel of the Lord came to him and said, "If you can get the people to believe you, nothing will stand before your prayer." And and listen to what he said. He said, "Not even cancer. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you know, in that day and at that time, cancer was actually a much bigger thing than even what it is today. &gt;&gt; They don't actually have a cure for it today, but then back then, they didn't even have treatments really for it. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; I believe, friends, we've got some things today actually that are much bigger than cancer. &gt;&gt; You know what the You know what the the biggest hindrance to people's faith is? is ignorance about what they've been afflicted with. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; They they they you know, the devil can work so much on your mind if you actually don't know what's going on. &gt;&gt; He can tell you anything. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Got to recognize it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Abraham now I'm not going to go into the whole story about Abraham tonight but you know brother Brandham points this out and he he says uh uh I'll read this is from he swore by himself and and brother says and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise &gt;&gt; after he had patiently endured brother said can you set your faith tonight and say this is thus sayeth the Lord and no matter what goes on whether it's today is easy whether Tomorrow is hard. No matter what happens, he said from day to day, can you endure? Can you set your faith and endure? Hold fast to your profession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he said, now listen, Abraham didn't get it before. &gt;&gt; He got it after he endured. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After he endured. Paul says this. He Paul says that he endured uh afflictions. And he said, "I endured." And he actually names off, you know, several things there in the book of Timothy. Uh you know, persecutions, afflictions, and and and all kinds of things. And he said, "But I endure." And and and he said, "But out of them all, the Lord delivered me." &gt;&gt; There is nothing too big for God. There's nothing too small for God. Sometimes people think, well, you know, I can see somebody going to get prayed for it for cancer. We know God will heal that and everything else. But I'm going to tell you something, friends. Read through the message. Listen to the prayer lines. There's times, brother Random called people out and said, "You've got allergies. God has healed you." &gt;&gt; Something so simple and little as they were having a a reaction to pollen or something in the air. &gt;&gt; God cares about you. Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You You know what the the Bible says? The Bible says in Philippians, Paul writes, "Be careful for nothing." &gt;&gt; You know what that means? It means don't be anxious. &gt;&gt; You know what anxious is? Being worried, &gt;&gt; Freddy, &gt;&gt; being nervous about it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, and many times people get that way because they they they're they're in a problem. They're in a a trial and they can't figure out how to get out of it. &gt;&gt; They're trying to solve it themselves. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, friends, my own experience, the more you try to solve it, the more you just get in God's way. &gt;&gt; What you need to do is pray, commit it to God, put it in his hands, and walk on. &gt;&gt; Quit worrying about it, cuz your worrying ain't going to change nothing. That's right. That's just the devil trying to drag you down and keep you tormented. &gt;&gt; Be anxious for nothing. Be careful for nothing. Paul says, and he says, "And the peace of God &gt;&gt; which surpasses all understanding." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, how you know, listen, he he says here, "Be careful for nothing but with prayer and supplications." &gt;&gt; Amen. and with thanksgiving let your requests be known. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You know, you think, well, why did Paul say prayer and supplications? &gt;&gt; Well, prayer, that's just your daily communication with God. &gt;&gt; Supplications is actually when you go and you're asking God, you're making a request. &gt;&gt; A lot of times people don't get what they what they need because they ain't asking. &gt;&gt; And there's a very simple principle of the Bible. Knock and the door shall be open. Seek and you'll find. Ask and you shall receive. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, kindergarteners can understand that. [Music] &gt;&gt; You don't believe it? Oh yeah. Well, my I'm sorry. I don't mean to jump off on things, but I want to tell you something. Sometimes ministers are afraid to share their personal experiences and let themselves look vulnerable before the people. &gt;&gt; But I find that when I read the message and I listen to the prophet, I find that he not only shared all of the supernatural experiences, but he actually also shared all his faults, his failures, and his mistakes, his downfalls. &gt;&gt; And you know what the prophet said about that? He said, "I I hope that my the my mistakes won't be stumbling blocks, but they'll be stepping stones &gt;&gt; to help somebody." &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, I want I want to be like Abraham. He said, Abraham made mistakes. He he had failures. He said, but when the divine commentary was wrote of Abraham's life, it never God never mentioned any of his mistakes, any of his failures. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God. &gt;&gt; But was strong in the faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "That's how I want my divine commentary to be wrote. That's how I want my divine commentary to be wrote." &gt;&gt; Lord, write it like that. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, friends. I'm not afraid to tell you about my mistakes or what I've done wrong or whatever else. Because you know why? I if if brother Brandham hadn't have done that, then in my mind, I don't know how you'd have felt about it, but in my mind, it would have put him as being like some superhuman that I could never attain to what he had. &gt;&gt; That that he was able to do that and have that life because he was a prophet. Well, I know he was a prophet. I know that he was a gift. I'm not looking for that gift. But you know what? I'm looking for the life. &gt;&gt; He didn't come to me to to give us the gift. He came to introduce Jesus Christ again to this to this age to this people to this end time bride. Introduce the life of God again to us &gt;&gt; now. Not not some kind of emotion. Not some kind of shout and dance and jump. All that's great. That's fine. Brother Brand had nothing against it. But that's not where our evidence lies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. A peace surpasses all understanding. &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't mean that it it's it's senseless, therefore impossible to understand. But what it means is it's beyond our ability to understand and even share and explain it sometimes by words. That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; A peace that passes understanding. It's not something that I can sit up here and give you a paragraph of words and then you say, "You got it." &gt;&gt; The peace that passes all and you got to experience that for yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. Did I Did I have this quote up about what he swore by himself? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now by faith, uh, move right into this blood cell with the Lord Jesus where all these redemptive blessings are yours." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're everyone a Christian, I presume. Then if you're a Christian, you have a right, a legal right to everything that Christ died for. It's your possession. You own it. It's yours. The only thing you had to do is do like Abraham. After he had endured a fight, he obtained the promise. &gt;&gt; Satan just don't let you take it easy. You got to have faith. You got to believe. You got to endure. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, last night I I preached up at brother Paul's and I I preached a sermon on being bullied and I talked about how that uh we're sometimes we're victims and it's actually the devil that's the bully. You know, and I get tired I got tired of being bullied &gt;&gt; by the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you know, this is the thing I I was sharing with brother Paul. We were talking later and I said, you know, I said, you know, that interview that brother Brandon had with Sister Bruce. Now, I'm not here to talk about your mistakes and all that. That's a great message and I could I could preach that one to you, too. But but when I I'm here to point out one thing when she was pointing out to him said, "I make so many mistakes, &gt;&gt; right?" And that's what her evidence was. She didn't think she had the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, here's the phrase I want to get to. He says in there, he goes, "That's what he died for." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Friends, when he died, &gt;&gt; he actually brought into our possession. &gt;&gt; Every redemptive promise was fulfilled there. All the fulfillment to bring every redemptive promise to his people was fulfilled right there with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's what brother Ramon is saying. It's yours. It belongs to you. Don't let the devil talk you out of it. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you, well, it was meant for you. God bless that brother testifying or that sister that's testifying so wonderful, but you know it's not really for you. &gt;&gt; No, it is for every child of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And let me just drop this in. Don't let the devil try to tell you that you're not a child of God. &gt;&gt; Friend, you know, I always said this when when when when I was growing up and a young teen, you know, and during the times I maybe was a rebellious and things, you know, I never in my life ever doubted that God had sent a prophet. I never questioned that. I never questioned whether this message was the truth or not. No, something I just knew it was. But you know, the thing that I questioned, Brother Wayne, was whether I was actually one of them. &gt;&gt; Was I a part of it? &gt;&gt; You know, cuz Satan's always telling you, "Well, no, you you really are serpent seed. You really identify with Cain." No, you really identify with Esau. &gt;&gt; You're a Judas. &gt;&gt; Look, friends, let me just drop this in. Satan don't even know who his own kids are. So, how can he tell you? &gt;&gt; God actually knows by fornowledge. He knew you and he called you and he ordained you. &gt;&gt; Satan don't even know his own kids. &gt;&gt; Because of what happened back during the time of the book of Genesis, you know, the seed lines all got crossed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Paul speaks about this in Romans. said, uh, was not Esau and Jacob born of the same parents. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we know that Jacob was a child, a seed of God. He was a son of God. Esau sure was not. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And God by his forn said, "Jacob have I love, and Esau I hate." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, friends, don't let the devil tell you you don't belong or you're not God's children. You don't even know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, don't listen to him. Listen to the one that actually knows. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, uh I'll share with you some about my my testimony. I uh about uh I see it was back in 2011. I started uh experiencing some real mental illness. And uh it started out real gradual, you know, and and there I'd get were times if nobody was at the house and I'd in the morning I it started out I wouldn't even get out of bed. I just lay there. Now I want you to know I was already pastoring a church down there in Dixon. I went down there actually in 1998. And so you know and so I I was just feeling so down and everything and then uh and so depressed. And this is the thing. It wasn't because there was bad things going on in my life. It wasn't because there was any stress. It wasn't because there was anything bad really going on or anything. And and so that's I didn't understand why am I feeling this way, you know, and and people talk to you and tell you, well, just don't think that way. Don't feel that way. Look, I I served five years in the army, so I know all about the mind games. And I know about all about that what, you know, that mind over matter they call it, you know, and and positive thinking and and you know, and and all those things about, you know, no pain, no gain and all that, you know, all the things that the army taught you, you know, and all that. But I'm going to tell you something, friends, that didn't work. &gt;&gt; Faith is not positive thinking. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; It goes way beyond that. &gt;&gt; It surpasses all understanding. It surpasses actually all thinking, all reasoning. &gt;&gt; And then, you know, it it began to just kept getting worse and worse on me. And then we actually had a a brother out of the church down there. He was actually going through some real mental battles at the time himself. And then on on the day he was supposed to get married, uh I got a call and he wasn't there at the church. And so I left the church and went to go to his house to find him and he had committed suicide, you know, and so I was the one that discovered the body and it was it I'll just tell you this, it was it's it's a horrific scene. All right? But I've never described it to anybody. I never will. But it but it it then it caused me to have like PTSD they call it. &gt;&gt; And and I was uh then here I was already suffering from this mental illness which I'll explain a little bit what in in a minute. But, uh, I was already starting to suffer from that. And then I had this. It was like the I was standing on a cliff and this just pushed me off and and so I just started to plummet and it got bad. And so while I'm trying to deal with this depression and anxiety and things, then all of a sudden now I got this PTSD, PTSD, what it was, uh, you know, something would happen or whatever, you know, and and and and all of a sudden it it was like I I wasn't even there anymore and I was back at that scene and seeing everything. And and when that happens, you know, whatever that was going on in your body at that time, your your if your heart raised, your blood pressure raised and and all these your body starts going doing all that again. &gt;&gt; Even though that it's not you're not there. That's what men that have been in AR in war and things like that that suffer from PTSD and things like that. It's what it is. they're back there again, &gt;&gt; you know, and their body, their mind, everything just starts like going and and all the physical things, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; and uh and so I was suffering from that. And so uh and then uh so then the next year would have been in June of 2012, my youngest son was going to get married. And so I I was supposed to be getting ready to go do the wedding and and uh so they were uh his wife was h they were having a wedding at her folks house lived out in the country, you know, and they were having a wedding outside there. And so I was at the house and I was starting to get ready and all of a sudden this anxiety hit me, Brother Wayne, and I started experiencing what I experienced on that day when when that other fellow was going to get married and and committed suicide. And and so then all these thoughts started flooding in. Your son's going to die. Your son's going to kill himself. and all don't make no sense, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; but but it was there, you know, and and I was experiencing this and it was just it was just tearing me up and and so I I I was asking the Lord to help me and I was trying to hold it together, you know, and I didn't tell my wife. I didn't tell my daughter or my sons or any of you. I didn't tell anybody about it. I'm just kind of holding it into myself. You know, that's it's a bad thing when you hold things into yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We need one another. That's right. &gt;&gt; We need support. We need prayer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, friends, look, I if if there's somebody that's reaching out to you that needs your support, don't try to fix them. &gt;&gt; Just be there for them. Pray with them. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Let them know you're there for them. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm going to tell you this, sometimes you people always want to fix somebody if you don't got the answer. And sometimes there's not actually an immediate &gt;&gt; resolution. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Many times as preachers, we sit down and counsel with people as pastors and we want to figure it out and solve the thing right there. That ain't reality. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to endure. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the people have to go through things that they're going to have to endure. &gt;&gt; But this is the promise. You will come out of it on the other side. &gt;&gt; As Paul said, the Lord will deliver you out of them all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, a after that wedding and things things kept getting worse, you know, when the and the depression, I just I was feeling so down and depressed and like giving up and everything and like I said, it didn't make no sense to me because everything was actually going really good in my life and in the church. I mean, besides that that suicide, but everything else, you know, it was going well, especially in my family, you know, and and and so it made no sense. and and and so then the devil, you know, of course he come and try to tell me there's something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; And then I I experiencing this anxiety when that would come on you these anxiety attacks, my wife actually begin to learn uh little signs, little ticks that I would have that she that I was getting ready to have an attack and she would say I'd always like begin to rub my temple right before they'd hit me and I didn't even realize I was doing it. And you know, and and she began to kind of educate herself on what was going on and things. uh when once she find but I finally I talked to my wife and my daughter and told them hey look this is what I'm going through my daughter my oldest daughter she's a nurse and she said daddy you got to go and talk to your primary physician and tell her what's going on so I did and I'll tell you this you know you think what you want about it you know and if you ever want to talk to me about it I I I'll be glad to talk to you about it but uh she started putting me on some medication for this depression and anxiety and things you know and I'll tell you something friends when you get so bad that that you you just and you start feeling like taking your own life, you know, you're willing for anything to give you some relief. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, over over the the period of years to to come, you know, it just kept getting worse. So, they she my doctor, you know, she done all she could, medication finally, she told me, she said, "Uh, look, Miss Brown, I've done all I can do for you. You it's surpassed my knowledge in in this." She says, 'I I really deal with the body, not actually the mind.' And she said, 'You need to go see a psychiatrist.' Now listen, let me tell you this. A lot of times people have this real stigma. They can understand somebody having diabetes, sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or or a heart condition that, but you get to talking about mental illness and mental things and that and some people got a stigma about it, you know, and and and and and you know, some say, "Well, if you got that, that means you ain't got the Holy Ghost. That is entirely wrong. [Music] &gt;&gt; I can tell you I can tell you from both from what I can tell you. Brother Brandham said, I can also tell you from experience. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this. He said a man could have a demon come. He says, and and torment him, he said, and get in his spirit realm and torment him. He said to where he would go completely insane. He said, but that ain't got a thing to do with that man's soul. Because friends, look, we are a three room uh uh unit here. &gt;&gt; The devil, he look, the only part that got the Holy Ghost was that inside of the inside, the soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're living in a body that's not perfect. This body actually is the way it is still because of the fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan can affect you in this body. &gt;&gt; Satan can get you all tore up in your spirit. You remember all the the five gates of the spirit brother talked about. &gt;&gt; So Satan can wreck havoc in there. &gt;&gt; He wrecks havoc in people's affections and emotions and and their memories and their imaginations and and reason. He he he just wrecks havoc in there. &gt;&gt; If you'll let him stay there. &gt;&gt; Brother Perry Green, I was talking to him one time. Brother Perry said, he said, you know, brother, he would talk to brother Brandham about he was having, he kept getting bad thoughts. You know, you probably heard brother Perry say he was getting bad thoughts and he felt real bad about it, especially being around the prophet. And he talked to brother Brandon about it and brother Brandon told him, he said, "Look, Eric," he said, "It's just Satan putting them thoughts. It's not your thoughts." He said, "Listen, you can't stop the birds from flying over, &gt;&gt; but you don't have to let them nest." You know, &gt;&gt; so Satan can can shoot the thoughts there. &gt;&gt; Don't dwell on them. Don't nest. Don't you Some people they invite him in for coffee. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Pull up a chair, devil. &gt;&gt; Let's think about this a while. Don't think about it. Don't dwell on it. &gt;&gt; Don't try to argue with him. Just ignore him. &gt;&gt; It got to a point where the medication won't be doing me no good no more. And and actually there's so many side effects, brother. I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this. Look, I'm not against people taking medication. All right? I'm not against if you got high blood pressure, sugar, diabetes, or you got mental health or heart condition, whatever it is. I'm not against Brother Brandham wasn't either. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that the knowledge that doctors have, God gave it to them to help poor suffering humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not against that. But that's not your lot in life. &gt;&gt; Come on, pre. He didn't say, "I'm the Lord thy God that will make you take pills the rest of your life." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the Lord thy God that health." [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And David said, "He health health all of my diseases." &gt;&gt; You know, people can believe for for for for physical illnesses, &gt;&gt; but it's just as real for mental illness. &gt;&gt; And this mental illness I'm talking look sometimes people they get down, depressed, you know, get down in their mind and everything because of stress. that's going on in their lives or or some bad problem or some bad trial they're going through. &gt;&gt; This wasn't that. &gt;&gt; And what I found out was that it's actually when you your your your your body is supposed to produce certain chemicals, and I won't name them all night, but one of them is actually serotonin. And it's supposed to produce those. And those are supposed to interact on your brain. Your brain needs chemicals &gt;&gt; to to to think. And you know when people get Alzheimer's and or or dementia and all that, it's because something's going wrong with the what should be supplying them brain cells &gt;&gt; and the brain cells start dying, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's like like this. Let me explain it this way. Uh if you got diabetes, you know what it is? is your your body your pancreas is supposed to produce insulin &gt;&gt; to break down the sugars in your blood. Now you got to have sugar in your body. Your brain actually won't function without you having some sugar in your blood. &gt;&gt; If a individual the sugar bottoms out and gets too low, you know, they could actually pass out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, so we got to have it. But what happens is a person's body that their pancreas, it stops actually uh producing the insulin, right? And then many times there's things going on our bodies that makes us what they call insulin resistant. Even if your body is producing insulin, your body's being resistant to it and it's not having the effect and people's blood sugars too high. &gt;&gt; Well, it's the same thing with with with this mental illness that I'm sharing with you. You know what happened was the chemicals are supposed to be produced to to actually act on the brain and the brain cells. My my body wasn't producing them. And so that's why I was feeling depressed over nothing. &gt;&gt; It didn't make any sense. And it wasn't that something was going on. It's because it wasn't operating right. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, it got so bad that during I think it was maybe uh 2016, I believe. Uh I got to a point I think for about a month, month and a half, I couldn't even preach. It got to a place, friends. And I'll tell you what, I was uh, you know, any of the brothers that preach can tell you, you know, uh, until God gives you an inspiration, you can sit down and read and study and read the Bible and everything else, but until God gives an inspiration to you, &gt;&gt; you know, maybe you see a cigarette pack laying on out in the woods, it says uh, a thinking man's filter, &gt;&gt; a smoking man's taste, you know, maybe you see something like that and it's just the inspiration that comes and when that inspiration hits, then it all starts coming. I wasn't getting no inspiration. I could study. I could read. I could try. Nothing was coming. &gt;&gt; And and and I had so much anxiety on me. I got nervous being around people. I got the world. Couldn't even counsel the people in my church with their problems and things cuz I was so tore up. &gt;&gt; And so I had a brother in my church. He he he actually preached for me for whatever that span was a month, month and a half or whatever, you know. And of course, I can tell you this, that church's faith was tested, &gt;&gt; you know, and I also tell you this, I really wasn't sharing with them what was going on with me. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because Satan makes you embarrassed. &gt;&gt; And and Satan was telling me, you know what? Something's wrong with you. &gt;&gt; You know, that's why you can't get anointed. That's why you can't feel it. That's why you can't get inspired. That's why you can't preach. Something's wrong with you. Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; I had a very good friend, Brother Wayne knows him, Brother Boatens, out in West Tennessee. And he he's very good friend of mine, ever since I moved down there. And I actually withdrawal from everybody. I wouldn't go visit no churches. I wouldn't talk to nobody. I wouldn't visit nobody. I just withdraw. Many times, even at the house of my family, I'd go off to myself in a room and shut the door. and and and and and so uh you know, brother but brother Bo, he he wouldn't leave me alone. &gt;&gt; He just kept calling me &gt;&gt; and he'd check on me. Now, he never tried to fix me, &gt;&gt; but he would talk to me about what was going on, you know, and he would try to share from his own experiences and and and he would say, "I'm praying for you, brother." And then I'd say, "Brother Bo, can you come see me?" And he said, "I'll be over." So, Brother Bo would come over to see me. And one time I was really going through it, the devil's saying, "You don't got the Holy Ghost. You know, something's really bad wrong with you. Look at the thoughts going through your head, how you're feeling, everything else. It's over for you. &gt;&gt; God's done with you." &gt;&gt; And friends, I'll tell you what, by the time he got done, I didn't even feel like a Christian anymore. &gt;&gt; Said, "You ain't got no faith. You ain't got nothing." &gt;&gt; And so, so I I asked Brother Bo, I said, "Brother Bo, can you come over and visit and preach?" And I said, "And pray for me. Lay hands on me." So he came over and uh and he preached. I can't even tell you what he preached on. I was so tore up. But he preached and when he got done preaching, my I was sitting with my wife and I told my wife, I said, "Help me get up there." I said, "Help me get up there." She took hold my arm and she helped me get up the aisle to get up there to the front. You know, sometimes you feel like you couldn't hardly move and get around. &gt;&gt; And and she got me up here to the front and brother Bo come down. He laid hands on me. He started praying for me. And I tell you what, friends, next thing I knew, I was in the floor. And and brother Bo told me he told the people don't worry that's just the spirit of God spell. He said that's the power of God said he just slayed him in the spirit. You know &gt;&gt; y'all might think all that God don't do that. That's Pentecostalism. &gt;&gt; Well you know what they were all in one accord in the upper room on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but I'll tell you what friends. Did I get healed? Did I get delivered? No. But I'll tell you what happened that day. It defeated the enemy who was putting all them thoughts in my head that that I God was done with me and I had no faith and I couldn't believe and God didn't care about me. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something. God cares about you. &gt;&gt; I heard brother Bispell say one time he said God cares so much about you he cares what you ate for breakfast this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; He There is nothing too small in your life that God says, "Well, that's insignificant. I don't really care about that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; After that, I thought, "Well, I don't know what I'm going to do. I I if I'm going to lose it all if I don't get up and start preaching again." So, so I got up and I couldn't, like I told you, I couldn't get inspired. I couldn't get anything new or whatever. So, I just went and dug out old notes and I and back then it wasn't things like this. It was paper. And so, I I dug out old notes, you know, and I I brought them up there and and and even with that, because the medication I was on, friends, it got me to a place where I was numb. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, and and I couldn't feel anything. If you done something that would have normally upset me, I didn't I couldn't even feel upset. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You know, if you done something that should have made me happy, I couldn't even feel happy. if it was something I should have got excited about. I couldn't even feel that. &gt;&gt; I just numb. &gt;&gt; So, I'd stand up there and many times what I did was I just read off them papers. &gt;&gt; You know, and uh then uh you know, I I started telling my brother, I said, "I can't feel anything." And he he's he and telling him now that. So then uh I went to the Philippines 2017 and and brother Roy Roel Soraniano and brother Landland uh they both of them brothers saw me I preached a camp down at brother landllands and then went up and preached a uh special meetings with brother Soraniano with my brother but they when the first time they heard me brother lands they said man you're different than you were 20 years ago what happened to you and they were they were trying and well it made me feel bad &gt;&gt; so when I got over to brother Oel's you know, was going to speak. They have the November one meetings he did back then. And so, uh, so I I was going to speak over there. So, I thought, well, let me just act excited. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And my brother told me, "Oh, don't tell me you don't you I saw you acting." I said, "It was an act." I said, "You know what happens, friends? You're so embarrassed, you feel so bad, you try to hide it from everybody." &gt;&gt; That's what the devil wants to do. He wants to get you off away from everybody. &gt;&gt; Get you off from the herd, so to speak, you know, get you out there alone, a lone deer on its own, &gt;&gt; where you become vulnerable. &gt;&gt; And where he can attack you and friends, he can just hammer your mind if you ain't got nobody else there to say, "Look, point you back to the word of God." Then now I know you might not like this part of my testimony but then I I got to thinking you know what I have gained so much weight because what I did was I I for comfort I ate. Some people they get like this with that mental illness and they don't eat and they just lose a bunch of weight. Unfortunately that was not me. I stand before you today. I've lost 80 pounds from where I where I started this &gt;&gt; you know and I'm not done yet. &gt;&gt; But what I started to do was friends I started to to to to go to the the hospital where I visit Vanderbilt there in Nashville and they started helping with with guided with nutrition and different things and to lose weight and and I started walking. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And and and I I got this thing, you know, I guess maybe from being in the military and everything. I I get like all in on stuff sometimes. So there was times I was walking 10 miles every morning. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; About killing myself, you know, and so I started to lose the weight and different things like that. And I started going back to the psychiatrist, you know, and I said, "Hey, look, you need to take I hate this stuff. You got to start taking me off this medicine." And he'd say, "Well, are you feeling this? Are are you thinking this way anymore?" I said, "No, I'm not thinking that way no more. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Take me off this stuff." I just started claiming it, friends. &gt;&gt; No, no. He said, "Are you having suicidal thoughts?" Nope, I'm not. &gt;&gt; The devil. He is, but I'm not. And so they started kind of, they say they can't just take you off those meds all at once. They say they got to walk you down, wing you off, you know. So they started doing that. And so then uh uh September of two of 2023, you know, I I got off I was only on maybe two or three medicines of of all the medications they had me on. And so I I I began to preach a message and just sharing about faith and believing God. And so at the end of it, I gave a testimony and I said I said, "Listen, I said God has healed me." &gt;&gt; And I said, "And and I've went off a lot of this medicine." I said, "But starting today, I ain't taking no more of it." I said, I I'm I'm I'm done. &gt;&gt; I said, I believe God's healed me. &gt;&gt; And so I went out to go home and that, you know, it was on a Sunday that night and went to go to bed. Now, I tell you this, uh to make a point, I I sleep with a CPAT machine. If you don't know what that is, somebody's got sleep apnea, they stop breathing while they're sleeping. And so this this CPAP, you sleep with a mask on and and it just blows air in your face continuously to keep you breathing. And and so I put that mask on. It was blowing air in my face. And I went to lay down on the bed. And when I did, friends, I all of a sudden it was like a big old heavy weight came down, rested on top of my chest, crushing me. And and and and and I can't breathe. And I started gasping and gasping for air. and and I nudged my wife and I jumped up out of bed and she said, "What's going on?" I said, "I can't breathe." I said, "Something's crushing me." I said, "I can't breathe. I can't breathe." I said, "I know it's the devil cuz what I testified." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Put your hands on me. Pray for me." &gt;&gt; So, she prayed for me. You know, he didn't let up. I'll tell you what, friends, I didn't get no sleep that night. Every time I tried to lay down, it just would attack me. &gt;&gt; And so, I went through that for about three nights in a row. And finally, you know, finally, I think it was about maybe around Friday or so that I I text my mom. You know, I got a lot of confidence in my mom. And I text my mom and I said, "Mom, you need to pray for me." And I started telling her what I was going through, what was happening to me. And I said, "I'm under attack here." And I said, and and and it it's real. I said, "There is something crushing my chest." And I said, "And I was sitting on the couch in living room gasping for air. my wife sitting there by me and I said, "You need to pray for me. Please pray for me." And so my brother, he was out, he was actually out having a special meeting somewhere. And so she text him right away and told him what was going on. So he sent back a quote that he sent my mom. It was brother Brandham talking about he was dealing with this woman he'd prayed for that had cancer and she got worse and she got more sick. And brother Brandham sent word to her said, "You tell her that is the best sign in the world that God has healed her." And friends, when I read that, I jumped up from that couch. I ran into my office. I grabbed out my computer, brought it out there cuz I'm I'm a felony that just kind of likes to read the paragraph before and the paragraph after just to make sure I got it all, you know? And so I went and got it and opened it up and I read all that and I sat there on that couch and when I read that, friends, that weight left me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I stopped gasping for air. I could breathe again. It was gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I sat there, friend. And I'll tell you what, I was so happy. Tears were just rolling down my face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you know what? That was Satan's last ditch attempt at me. &gt;&gt; I ain't never suffered from any of it ever again. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friends, I tell you what, &gt;&gt; I endured that for 12 long years. You think about getting discouraged and feeling like you ain't going to get healed. &gt;&gt; This is just how it's going to be. And you know, and Satan, of course, you know, when you go into a doctor, brother Wayne, for like for for physical things, they say, "Uh, has your daddy ever had a heart condition? Has your uncle, has your brother, has your mom, you know, has your grandfather, you know, they do the same thing when you're going for mental illness?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They do the same thing. They ask you, "Well, brother, I I got relatives that have suffered mental illness, you know, and and so, you know, then the devil works that on your mind." See, it's genetically inherited. &gt;&gt; Well, I might have been genetically predisposed to have the chemicals to stop working right in my mind. But that's just in my body. The part that came from heaven, the part that came from God, it ain't got no part with that. [Music] [Applause] I realize that Satan, he can't touch me. &gt;&gt; He might be able to touch my body. He might be able to touch my spirit. But brother Bam said, "You look at me, you don't even see me." &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you this, friends. You look at me and you see a a a heavy set fell with bald hair. &gt;&gt; I look and I see this skinny fella about 145 lbs with blonde hair. You remembering Mishi? &gt;&gt; Thick head full of hair. I was proud of it, too. [Music] First time my wife met me, she said, "I never seen nobody couldn't walk past their reflection without combing their hair." Friends, look, I I have dreams that I wake up to go clean up at the sink in the morning and look up in the mirror and I'm a young man again. I'm going to tell you something. It might be seem like it's just a dream, but to me, it's going to be a reality. &gt;&gt; There's a part of me that Satan can't touch. &gt;&gt; And I got news for you, brother Wayne. I'm starting to feel like shouting now. I got news for you. We're coming down to a time, friends, of the millennium where it said he'll be bound for a thousand years. &gt;&gt; Brother said it ain't with the logging chain. It's a chain of circumstance. And they said the circumstance is you're not going to be in this fallen conditioned flesh anymore. You're going to be in a glorified body. Amen. That that's wrapped around a theophony that has the real you living on the inside. Hallelujah. I tell you what, he has bullied me and and pushed me and tormented me so much, friends, I'll be glad to torment him during that time. &gt;&gt; I want to be like Elijah was with the the prophets of Baal. Maybe you God can't hear you. Maybe you need to shout louder. Or maybe he's on vacation. He torment them into them men. He taunted them. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie said, he said, "You know, the Bible says that the the the devil's going to get kicked into the pit." He says, "I'd like it to be my foot." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, we don't got to be tormented by the devil. We don't got to put up with it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, friends, why does God have us endure things? Because there's going to be some growth happening you. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you this, friend. Now, God has not only restored me, hallelujah, mentally, he's not only restored me physically, but friends, I'll tell you what, I've come back stronger than I ever was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz during that 12 years of affliction, God just kept revealing faith to me. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this. I said it, brother Paul, first time I ever said it before. you know, just the spirit of God came on me and I said, you know, the devil had me so scared of him. But I'm going to tell you something now, friends. I believe that God's gave me a testimony and experience that the devil is afraid of me. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because there's people, listen, friends, talk to pastors, talk to churches, talk to the people who preach at the youth camps, and you'll find out that there's people everywhere, even young people, suffering from mental illness. &gt;&gt; It's like an epidemic. Right. &gt;&gt; And and you know what the hindrance is to a lot of them is people tell them just don't think that way. &gt;&gt; If you just really had faith and believe God, you you wouldn't be thinking that. You wouldn't have that mental illness. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Shame on them. &gt;&gt; Pray for them people. Help them people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, I I believe friends, look, I am happy to have endured it. &gt;&gt; If there is something that God can do from my life and my experience and my testimony, which friends, look, I'm not I I am not shy to tell you I ain't superhuman. &gt;&gt; I ain't shy to tell you I'm flesh and blood just like you are. &gt;&gt; I have trials just like you do. But if God from that experience that he had me endure, &gt;&gt; if somehow it can help lead others to believe and grasp by faith and get healed and delivered, cuz I'm telling you something, friends, God wants to heal you. &gt;&gt; He came, he died to heal us. He died to deliver us. He died to set us free. Not just from the spirits of physical disease, but every all diseases. &gt;&gt; Everything you got going on in your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're going through a trial, friends, don't let that drag you down. And you say, "Well, it's going on for a while. God's just going to get great glory from it." &gt;&gt; 400 years. Israel was down in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God gave Abraham a promise and he said, "After 400 years, I'll bring them back and I'm going to give them this land." He said, "But I can't do it right now because of the cup of iniquity of the Amorites ain't full yet." &gt;&gt; He said, "But I'm going to bring them back." 400 years went past. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then God was ready to deliver and they weren't ready to be delivered. So Moses had to leave and go out in the in the wilderness because we know what he' done and you know he tried to take it in his own hands. We know all about that. But brother Ram says this. He said God was ready to deliver them people right then. He said but they wasn't ready. He said so Moses left and it was another 40 years. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Endure. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Don't let go. Don't look at reason. &gt;&gt; Don't look at nothing the devil tells you. Don't think well you know my genetics my family whatever that look that look this that ain't your family like brother Brandham said he come to the revelation I am not the son of Charles and Ella Brandom. I am a son of God and that's what you are tonight. You are sons and daughters of God. Come on now. &gt;&gt; This this flesh body that you live in, it might have inherited things from your uh natural father and mother here on this earth, but the real you that's on the inside didn't come from them. &gt;&gt; It come from God. I come from God and I go back to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got a revelation of predestination. Yes. &gt;&gt; I got a revelation who my father is. &gt;&gt; It tells me where I came from and it tells me where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. I'm just passing through here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I come from a a supernatural heavenly place. I was in the mind of God. I was in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Before the world was ever even created. Amen. &gt;&gt; God thought about me before he thought about making this earth. &gt;&gt; I love that song. When he was on the cross, &gt;&gt; I was on his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. 2,000 plus years ago when he was dying on the cross, of course, Peter and all the rest of them, they were all around and all that, you know, and everything. And and of course, you know, Brother Bam said it was a hard thing for Jesus in the garden because he had to come down and conquer his flesh and leave his disciples. &gt;&gt; You know, but I'll tell you what, when he was dying, friends, you were on his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your great great great granddaddy didn't even exist yet, &gt;&gt; but you were on his mind. &gt;&gt; He was dying for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He He didn't just die for the guy or the the the the sister next to you. He died for you. &gt;&gt; And all the redemptive promises &gt;&gt; that that is now yours under that. Amen. How many How many says, "I believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friends, look, we can this this is a strange thing. Brother Brandham said, I let me just drop this and I'll close. Brother talking about enduring. Brother Brandham gave a testimony. He was he was saying that he said, "I prayed for people." He said he was talking about him having that real bad stomach issue and all that, you know, and he says, "I've prayed for people that had far worse diseases than what I've got." He says, "And and God healed them through that prayer." He said, "And there I was standing there suffering with that." And he said he suffered with for years. And when he was given this one particular word about it and testimony, he told him, "I'm still suffering from it. I'll get back to you and let you know when I'm healed." &gt;&gt; He had to endure. &gt;&gt; Right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother said if you want your prayers to be successful, he says put yourself in that person's shoes that you're praying for. &gt;&gt; You know, I I back in 2017, I was still suffering real bad and I come up to my brothers and he just wouldn't let me get by. He just kept forcing me to speak. And so I had this little message. I think it was one of my first little inspirations, you know, coming out of this. And and and I preach on midnight what I called it. and about darkness in your life, you know, and and and there was a a young sister that was there in that meeting and and she had just recently been put on medication and she was going through this mental illness. And so she came up to the front, you know, and she said, "Brother Jerry, can you pray for me and this is what I'm suffering with?" Friends, I stood there and I, you know, I was like, "Man, that's what I'm suffering with." &gt;&gt; And so, but I I prayed for her, you know, you know, and then I got the testimony back. God healed her right there. And I went out of there and went home to Tennessee still afflicted. &gt;&gt; Wow. Then then you know few months later after that my brother and I we we went I think it was then maybe it was 2019 but anyway we went over to the Philippines together and uh we after uh we yeah it must have been 2019 we had preached this youth camp and we was preaching this youth uh like retreat that brother Sorano had and then they had a questions and answer service and it turns out there was uh some young sister there I guess was uh somebody started asking the questions for her she didn't ask the question somebody else, a friend was asking the questions for and they were asking and it had to deal with mental health and so my brother turned to me and he said, "Jerry, won't you take this one?" And so, uh, you know, I I talked to the young people for a little bit, you know, on that. And then, uh, this the last service was over and then, uh, I that that Sunday morning, uh, they took my brother and he went to one church to preach and and then he get the associate pastor. He's actually the pastor there now, Brother Boyd. and and they he took me and went to this little village, you know, and we went to this little village, you know, and I went into this little humble little ch church to preach, you know, and I preached, you know, and and and then we had somebody that wanted to be baptized after. So, we we baptized them and and then uh after that, they were having some testimonies and here's this young lady that had been in those meetings. She comes up, she says, "I got a testimony to give." &gt;&gt; And she said, "I was in those meetings." And she said, "I was suffering from mental illness, from depression. I wanted to take my life." She said, she says, "And brother Jerry just talked to me." She says, "And it changed my life. &gt;&gt; I didn't even know I was talking to her." Her friend was the one that asked the questions. &gt;&gt; But I but I looked at friends and I thought, Lord, I was like, "Brother Brandon, here these people are getting healed from this very same thing I'm I'm suffering from and I'm still suffering." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, friend. I'm happy that I suffered. I'm happy that I endured. I'm happy to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If God can somehow just be a blessing to you. &gt;&gt; My life, my experience, my can just somehow be a blessing to you and help you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, friends. Look, if you're suffering, and I'm not going to embarrass anybody, but there was someone that that that sent word to me said, "Pray for them." you know that they were suffering from mental illness and that. And I'll tell you this, friends, I find out their name. I got up every morning and and I still do. I get up at night and I call their name out in prayer. I pray, God, help them get up today. Help them get out of bed. Help them make it through the day, Lord. Help them eat breakfast. Bless their food, Lord. I I pray you heal them, God. Heal them. But until you do, Lord, help her help them through this day, you know, and then then at lunchtime, Lord, bless her food. Help them through. Help help this person through, you know, and and then and then the bedtime, Lord. Help them to get some rest in their body now. Help them be able to go to sleep, Lord. Cuz you know what it is, friends? I know what it's like to endure &gt;&gt; day in and day out. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, God is going to heal them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when when when God brings that healing, you are you are actually stronger for it and the devil's weaker. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, I'm here tonight to say boo back to the devil. Amen. Let's stand. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, Lord, I thank you tonight, Lord. I God, I I felt on my heart. I didn't really know how know how to share it. Lord, Lord, we just want to be a help, God. I pray you know everyone here. You know what they're suffering with. You know what? how if Satan is afflicting them, whatever it is, whether it's physical, whether it's mental, whether it's some type of a trial or issue that's going on in their life, their family, or whatever, Lord, you you're here tonight, Lord, to bring them the answer, dear God. And that answer, Lord, is just hold fast. &gt;&gt; Don't let go. &gt;&gt; Hold fast in faith, God. The answer's on the way, God. One time God Daniel prayed and and and asked you Lord. And God he he waited I think it was 40 days waiting for you to answer Lord. Finally an angel comes through and said God heard you the first day Daniel. And he sent an angel. He sent me from the from his presence to come tell you. But then I was beset by the prince of Persia and he had to send Michael down with the angels to fight and make a hole through for me to get to you. Sometimes, Lord, Lord, that's what it is, Lord. That we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and and powers and rulers in high places and darkness. But Lord, you have empowered us. You've gave us the the the most powerful weapon in the world, prayer. &gt;&gt; It changes things. &gt;&gt; And Lord, if we can pray, Lord, and just believe it and commit it to you, Lord, it will happen. because you said whatever you ask that you would give it to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Bless your people tonight, dear God. We ask it for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm not on an ego trip. I'm nothing. on my own. I make mistakes and often sl just come in flesh and bone. But I'll prove someday just what I say. I'm of a special kind when he was on the cross. Yes, I was.

[Music] My redeemer is faithful and true. &gt;&gt; The scripture just come on my heart. You know the Lord said above all things he would that you would prosper in health. And you know that's not just the health of your body, &gt;&gt; but again in the scripture he said that he was not giving us the spirit of fear &gt;&gt; but of love and of power &gt;&gt; and of a sound mind. So I certainly believe that God desires us uh that we would have that kind of a health mentally &gt;&gt; in an age when it when everything around us is trying to take that health from us. &gt;&gt; And you know u brother Jerry we're we're so sorry you had to suffer those things but we as an assembly we certainly have prospered from what you have went through. to hear your testimony tonight. We thank you for sharing with us. [Applause] [Music] A man gets deep in his life like that and pulls out a piece and shares and vulnerability and weakness. It it it takes it takes a lot of courage to stand before a congregation and put yourself out like that, but knowing that by him doing that that God's going to help somebody and he's going to use that. And you know, uh, I appreciate you helping deal with the stigma that's around mental mental health and and what is there, but nobody thinks nothing if somebody breaks an arm, but if they're having uh if they're having struggles mentally, it's like something's wrong with them. Well, Amen. It's not always something wrong. It may just be something that's just out of balance or something that's happened. Amen. But the Holy Spirit has a way of of healing the mind, the body, the soul, and then send the man of God by and tell you &gt;&gt; even after 12 long years. &gt;&gt; 12 long years, &gt;&gt; and he's more more powerful preacher tonight than I heard 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; His he there's a there's a faith &gt;&gt; that is resting there. And I and I thank you for that nugget. &gt;&gt; You don't have to testify to your healing. You can testify to your faith. And I I'll tell you what, I wrote that down in my book. And Amen. I'm going to give the devil a whipon with that. Amen. I don't I don't have to be healed. I got faith. &gt;&gt; And my faith says I'm going to be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I certainly appreciate that. What a what a powerful powerful testimony. Amen. I I told him, my daughter Mariah, uh I said, "I don't know what you did, but you sure got a fan there." And she was telling me about how God had so worked in his life. and and uh and I certainly have I certainly have not only heard, but I felt the witness uh of what God was doing. Amen. In the meeting tonight, and we certainly want to thank him. Amen. He just couldn't take that no more. Amen. Clear the webs. Clear clear the webs. Amen. Did we get it? We get it. Get it. Somebody get a broom. So, we certainly love you tonight. Thank you for coming to the house of God. Amen. And and be sure to if the man of God gets around a little bit, certainly shake his hand and and thank him for coming our way. Amen. He he didn't have to include us, but he did. And I I we certainly Thank you, brother Jerry. God bless you. It's a tremendous blessing. Thank you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] What a what amazing grace. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts tonight and just as we would uh pray and dismissal, I also want you to remember the meeting this weekend down in Tennessee with brother David Ser and the youth that is there. We pray that God would give a special anointing. Our our young people are are in a real battle in this age. And so we ask the Lord for his mercy. Father, as we bow our hearts tonight, we have, Lord, we've heard not just a sermon tonight, but we've been given a piece of my brother's life where he shared, Lord, his agonies, his dark areas, Lord, the weaknesses. But Lord, he only done that to teach and to say, "What a wonderful healer you are." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, to testify to whoever is struggling tonight. Maybe somebody out even on the air, they're going to get this tape or they're going to hear it. Lord, maybe they're in a great battle, but Lord, you sent a man of God, Lord, to testify that there's a healing. No matter what you're suffering, there's a healing. And we thank you tonight for this great witness that you have given us. And Father, we believe it. We believe your word, Lord. We believe the blood has covered it all. And we thank you for the redemptive ride tonight to claim our healing and faith. Father, now we ask you would bless this congregation. Lord, bless them on the way home and out this meetings throughout the weekend. Lord, we pray you bless the young people there. But here at home, we pray, Lord, that you would anoint brother Ericson, Lord, use him for your glory. And Father, we ask you these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen and amen. We certainly love you. God bless you in Jesus name as you're dismissed of mine. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm going through. Yes, I'm going through. I'll pay the price. Whatever others do, [Music] I'll take away with the Lord's despise you. I started with Jesus and I'm going through. Yes, I'm going through. Oh yes, I'm going through. I'll pay the price whatever others do. I'll take away with the Lord's despise you. I started Lord and I'm going through. Yes, I'm going through. I'm going through. I'll pay the price whatever others do. I'll take away where the Lord despise you. Lord, I've started [Music] Jesus and I'm going through. Oh yes, I'm going through. Oh, I'm going through. [Music] I'll pay Christ. [Music] I'll take away with the Lord despise you. Lord, I've started. Oh, I'm going through. Oh, I'm going through. I'm going through. I'll pay. I'll take the way. Oh my [Music] [Applause] [Music] god. [Music]
