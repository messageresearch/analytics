[0:15] is the philistines never come yet
[0:19] looking good
[0:20] cause the pity the philistines demand
[0:22] part
[0:26] no i was reading these rules just this
[0:28] morning
[0:29] i could not find anywhere that we are to
[0:31] give a portion of our success to anyone
[0:34] except through sacrifices
[0:37] really yes
[0:38] i am an israelite by birth
[0:41] jehovah promises that israelites have
[0:43] possessed the gates of their enemies
[0:45] right we are all israelites we have that
[0:48] promise from long ago
[0:50] but how does that help us now that means
[0:52] that we don't have to let the
[0:53] philistines keep defeating us and
[0:55] leaving us absolutely
[0:58] we can defeat the philistines if we
[1:00] believe the promises
[1:02] i don't know shannon that sounds awfully
[1:04] risky
[1:05] but why should we continue to live below
[1:07] our privileges if a promise is there we
[1:10] just have to claim it and live it
[1:12] i still think it's best to keep the
[1:14] philistines happy and not question it
[1:16] it's my right to claim what i have word
[1:18] for why should i let the enemy just come
[1:21] and take it i'm tired of getting into
[1:23] their every demand
[1:26] many will just forget about us this year
[1:28] that way we don't have to worry about
[1:30] causing the scene i dare you by this
[1:32] time every other year they've been here

[18:12] sir
[18:15] they decided to move on to the next
[18:16] house
[18:17] yes no doubt that's it my captains were
[18:20] a source leader and that would make
[18:22] goodness their time
[18:26] i'm sure you're right sir
[18:35] sir sir the scout what about the scout
[18:38] she's here
[18:41] where are the rest of the troops

[19:00] sir
[19:02] canvar destroyed our army
[19:06] how many lost just a few casualties

[19:21] oh he killed them all
[19:24] all 600
[19:26] how
[19:27] i'm sure there's a logical explanation
[19:29] for this
[19:30] but how is this logically possible
[19:33] he said he had the power of the lord
[19:35] with him and this power doesn't destroy
[19:37] the entire unit yes sir it was the
[19:40] strangest thing he don't need to touch
[19:42] them and they fell dead

[19:49] chamber killed 600 of my trained
[19:52] soldiers
[19:53] with a stick
[19:55] unbelievable
[19:56] totally illogical
[19:58] yes sir i know sir had i not been there
[20:01] i would have trouble believing it was
[20:03] possible sir i have heard of the god of
[20:05] israel his mighty power well today was a
[20:08] definite demonstration of his power to
[20:11] think that our best gender newspapers
