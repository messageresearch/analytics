[42:23] children that he'd make everything work
[42:25] together for our good whether it's
[42:27] sickness or prison house or death or
[42:30] Sorrows whatever it is that it would
[42:32] work out for our good that loved him and
[42:34] he promised it and it must be so it's
[42:37] got to be there aren't you glad tonight
[42:40] that he said that he would Prosper you
[42:42] amen and and that you are children of
[42:44] the prosperity of God tonight that he

[48:26] word God is bringing back to us I was
[48:31] with you I was with you I was with you
[48:35] before the foundation of the world Amen
[48:39] and only God can do
[48:41] that amen because that's God's
[48:44] plan and God never makes
[48:47] mistakes amen so may God richly bless us

[48:59] amen why are we
[49:03] here why are we here did anybody ask the
[49:07] question because I want to meet
[49:10] Jesus and God's word is as efficient
[49:15] tonight as it was the first time it was
[49:19] spoken I might talking to Believers
[49:22] tonight I'm not bringing a new doctrine
[49:26] I'm not bringing something you have
[49:28] never heard because you have powerful
[49:29] preachers here amen we look up to the
[49:32] generals I'm just a small pebble amongst
[49:37] great great Pebbles I say that with all
[49:40] my heart love you dearly so I'm not
[49:43] bringing anything
[49:44] new but the preaching of the word that's
[49:48] what gives us
[49:49] Faith that's the only thing the pure
[49:52] word of God that's what gives us perfect
[49:55] faith so we don't want to add we want to
[49:58] take away just preach it in all its
[50:01] truth and all its power and it's say if
[50:04] that's what the prophet says it's as
[50:06] efficient think of it when he said let
[50:09] there
[50:10] be and even today we enjoy the sun we
[50:15] enjoy the
[50:17] light but that's the power of God's word
[50:20] tonight so if you have a need he's still
[50:24] the same God
[50:27] amen thank you musicians if you continue
[50:30] playing I will just start
[50:35] singing amen if we can take the word of
[50:38] God so we truly love
[50:41] you
[50:45] amen the prophet says before we take the
[50:48] Bible he says what are we doing we are
[50:51] getting ready for the
[50:54] Rapture young and old we are getting
[50:57] ready for the Rapture I told Brother Ray
[50:59] this afternoon I said hey you're closer
[51:01] to 18 as you as you've ever
[51:05] been and the young people laugh you know
[51:08] I just turned 50 so they even my kids
[51:10] say you're getting older
[51:12] dad but I'm closer to 18 that I've ever
[51:16] been I'm getting ready for that young
[51:19] people meeting amen what a time it will
[51:22] be so he says we're getting ready for
[51:24] Rapture holding ourselves steady for a
[51:27] few minutes here tonight holding
[51:29] ourselves steady till every fiber is
[51:33] filled with the Holy Ghost that's my
[51:36] desire tonight till every fiber every
[51:40] molecule every atom is filled with the
[51:43] power of
[51:44] God is it possible that's God's word oh
[51:48] yes it is and that's God's desire amen
[51:52] amen he's calling his people together to
[51:54] himself in true
[51:57] Oneness with himself that's what is
[52:00] happening now there's an invisible Union
[52:03] going on the world doesn't know about it
[52:06] but the bride and the bridegroom knows
[52:08] all about it and it's real that's why I
[52:12] Rejoice many people it passes over their
[52:15] head but oh I can Rejoice amen because
[52:18] the invisible Union is real and we're
[52:21] getting ready to leave this place
[52:25] hallelujah amen amen amen amen if we can
[52:28] take the Bible Galatians
[52:31] 4 so I'm sorry if I have a little
[52:37] accent I'll try my
[52:41] best Galatians
[52:44] 4 start from verse
[52:47] one and say Amen when you're there
[52:57] now I say that the heir as long as he is
[53:01] a child deferreth nothing from a servant
[53:05] though he be the Lord of all but is
[53:08] under tutors and governors until the
[53:11] time appointed of the father even so we
[53:15] where we were children were in bondage
[53:18] under the elements of the world but when
[53:20] the fullness of time was come God sent
[53:23] forth his son made of a woman made made
[53:26] under the law to redeem them that were
[53:29] under the law that we might receive the
[53:31] adoption of sons and because you are
[53:34] Sons God had sent forth the spirit of
[53:37] his son into your hearts crying ABA
[53:40] father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[53:44] servant but a son and if a son then an
[53:48] heir of God through
[53:51] Christ Hallelujah isn't that wonderful
[53:55] if we look to the word
[53:57] the Lexicon of
[53:59] adoption I'm not well I can try to
[54:02] pronounce it's it's
[54:05] weia excuse
[54:08] my pronunciation but it means the nature
[54:13] and condition of a true disciple in
[54:16] Christ who by receiving the spirit of
[54:20] God into their souls becomes sons of God
[54:25] my
[54:27] I love it Hallelujah Romans
[54:35] 8 verse
[54:45] 15 for ye have not received the spirit
[54:48] of bondage again to fear but ye have
[54:52] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[54:54] we cry ABA father
[54:57] the spirit itself beared witness with
[55:00] our spirit that we are the children of
[55:04] God then verse 30 moreover whom he did
[55:09] predestinate them he also called and
[55:12] whom he called them he also Justified
[55:15] and whom he justified them he also
[55:19] glorified what shall we then say to
[55:22] these things if God before us then who
[55:27] can be against
[55:28] us hallelujah can we say that together
[55:32] if God before me for us who can be
[55:35] against
[55:36] us hallelujah Ephesians 1 have two more
[55:44] scriptures Ephesians
[55:49] 1 verse
[55:52] 4
[55:54] according as he had chosen Us in him
[55:59] when before the foundation of the world
[56:02] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[56:05] before him in love having predestinated
[56:07] us unto the adoption of children by
[56:09] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[56:12] good pleasure of his will so it's God's
[56:16] pleasure and it's God's will who can say
[56:20] anything line up every demon of Hell who
[56:25] can say anything
[56:27] against God's
[56:31] will Hallelujah that alls make let feels
[56:35] so good it's Friday night yes but I'm
[56:39] here to get a charge from God and I feel
[56:42] good because I hear that is the will of
[56:45] God that is God's desire that he chose
[56:48] me he justified me he already
[56:52] glorified hallelujah amen amen oh in
[56:56] verse six to the praise of the glory of
[56:59] his grace wherein he had made us
[57:02] accepted in the
[57:05] Beloved my one final verse John
[57:09] 16 verse
[57:19] 28 Short scripture but a powerful
[57:24] verse and that gets my
[57:27] amen I come from the father and I'm
[57:31] comeing into the world again I leave the
[57:33] world and go to the father may God add
[57:37] the blessing to the reading of his word
[57:40] let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[57:42] father lord it's such a great honor and
[57:45] a privilege to be standing on Holy
[57:47] Ground tonight father knowing that you

[57:52] gathered in my name that you are amongst
[57:54] us father even before we arrived you are
[57:57] already here Lord God and you knew
[58:00] exactly who was going to be here father
[58:02] you know the needs of your people and
[58:04] Lord we have gathered here Lord knowing
[58:07] that you are still the I am so father we
[58:09] want to put everything as lay everything
[58:11] aside and put everything into your H
[58:13] hands Lord every need Lord you know them
[58:16] Father and may you speak to every heart
[58:19] may you take me out of the way father
[58:21] God speak through the vessel may you
[58:23] anoint our ears Lord God that we may
[58:26] hear what you want to say to us father
[58:28] and by the speaking the preaching of the
[58:30] word Lord God lord may we our faith grow
[58:34] stronger and stronger Lord God Lord
[58:36] because we know father your word will
[58:39] never fail so I pray father may we find
[58:42] Grace in your sight Lord God Lord in our
[58:45] praise in our worship Lord in the
[58:47] preaching father May everything be for
[58:49] your glory Lord we we commit ourselves
[58:52] into your hand I pray in the wonderful
[58:54] name of our Lord Jesus Christ Christ
[58:57] amen and amen and amen God bless you you
[59:00] may be
[59:01] seated amen for a title
[59:04] tonight amen I just want to take it out
[59:08] of Galatians I am a
[59:12] son an heir of God through Christ you
[59:17] know there's something about saying who
[59:20] you are because Satan bombards us day in
[59:25] Day Out
[59:26] night 24 24 77 36 30 365 sorry days a
[59:34] year but when God talks to us and when
[59:38] we take it by faith not by reasoning and
[59:41] when we speak the word Satan is
[59:47] powerless Satan is powerless amen when
[59:51] even when we feel weak tonight amen he
[59:54] says when the the weakest of the Saints
[59:57] goes down on his
[1:00:00] knees all hell
[1:00:02] trembles amen so even tonight you may
[1:00:05] feel weak but let me tell you he is
[1:00:08] still strong my Lord and Savior and just
[1:00:12] a touch can make you
[1:00:14] whole amen so tonight just going to take
[1:00:18] some time amen because you know when the
[1:00:20] bride knows her
[1:00:24] position then the Rapture will take
[1:00:26] place so there's something about knowing
[1:00:28] who we are not here here amen Einstein
[1:00:34] how many have heard of Einstein
[1:00:38] good I'm not going to preach on E equals
[1:00:40] MC
[1:00:42] squ that's for all the young people CU
[1:00:45] all we all forgot about that you know
[1:00:48] Einstein made a declaration he said I
[1:00:50] want to know God's thoughts the rest are
[1:00:54] details my
[1:00:57] I love that the rest is not important
[1:01:01] but what are God's thoughts concerning
[1:01:06] us my what are his thoughts what is his
[1:01:09] will what is his desire amen so brother
[1:01:13] brandham says we come out of Eternity
[1:01:17] stepped into a little time space here
[1:01:20] and Ste out of time back to
[1:01:23] Eternity amen so we are just here for a
[1:01:25] little lapse of time young people and
[1:01:28] Aller people you know when we young we
[1:01:30] are always Desiring something and all we
[1:01:33] so no matter how young how old we are we
[1:01:36] just come here for a little lapse of
[1:01:40] time even if I would be 100 years old I
[1:01:43] would say it's still a little lapse of
[1:01:45] time because give me the percentage of
[1:01:48] what is a little lapse of time 100 years
[1:01:50] compared to
[1:01:53] Eternity that's zero come out
[1:01:57] 000000 many zeros
[1:01:59] percent you following good hallelujah
[1:02:04] amen so we see in 1 John 1 John 3:2
[1:02:09] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:02:12] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:02:14] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:02:17] shall be like him Fe for we shall see
[1:02:20] him as he
[1:02:23] is my what a privilege people we are to
[1:02:27] see him amen as he is amen because we
[1:02:32] received an open book The revealed word
[1:02:36] so we can see our true
[1:02:39] identity
[1:02:40] hallelujah amen amen amen a lot of
[1:02:43] Christians have problems today they
[1:02:46] don't know what their position is what's
[1:02:48] my identity amen we live in an age where
[1:02:50] there's an identity crisis I don't know
[1:02:53] if I'm a man I don't know if I'm a woman
[1:02:55] I don't know if I'm a dog I don't know
[1:02:57] if I'm a giraffe I a Son of God I come
[1:03:00] from God and I go back to God and Satan
[1:03:04] with all his nonsense tried to trap
[1:03:06] people in believing the nonsense yes
[1:03:09] there is an anointing going there but
[1:03:12] God sent us the eagle anointing to fly
[1:03:16] in the heavenlies to Fly Above All the
[1:03:20] nonsense people are afraid to say it's
[1:03:24] nonsense
[1:03:26] people are afraid to preach the truth
[1:03:29] people are afraid to say I am a Son of
[1:03:32] God Amen but God came and he opened a
[1:03:35] book for me to tell me who I am to tell
[1:03:39] me where I come
[1:03:40] from oh yes and Satan with all his
[1:03:45] demons cannot stop God's word to
[1:03:50] perform so I'm here and whoever wants to
[1:03:54] join with me come on to knock Satan
[1:04:00] out do we have some boxers tonight
[1:04:03] sisters that's for you too
[1:04:07] sisters
[1:04:08] hallelujah amen so my thoughts amen are
[1:04:13] not his
[1:04:14] thoughts my ways are not his
[1:04:17] ways so we want to listen to What God
[1:04:20] Says About Us amen so in Romans 3 he
[1:04:24] says let God be through and every man be
[1:04:27] a liar so no matter whoever Satan or
[1:04:32] whoever
[1:04:33] says we go to the word and see what he
[1:04:37] says about it that's why brother ofam
[1:04:40] says you should give everything the word
[1:04:43] test because nowadays A lot of people
[1:04:45] have opinions a lot of people want to
[1:04:47] say something about something that God
[1:04:50] said and God sent us a messenger vind
[1:04:55] ated by God
[1:04:57] himself and who do they think they
[1:05:01] are who do they think they
[1:05:04] are I'll make more sense to it no you're
[1:05:08] speaking nonsense that's what they
[1:05:13] do why did he say say what I
[1:05:16] say oh he meant this he meant that no
[1:05:19] God knows exactly what he said when he
[1:05:21] said I am a son amen that's what he
[1:05:24] means when he said I come from God I go
[1:05:27] back to God that's what he
[1:05:30] means hallelujah amen I am believer in
[1:05:34] What God Says in his word and he gave
[1:05:37] power to his church says the
[1:05:40] word and nowhere have I seen in the
[1:05:43] scripture in the word where God took it
[1:05:46] away but we live in an age where people
[1:05:50] by their tradition by their intellect
[1:05:53] triy to take God out of the church
[1:05:58] church that's
[1:06:00] exactly the spirit of anti
[1:06:04] christ because he wants to get the glory
[1:06:07] out of the church where God sent his
[1:06:12] power he sent his power he said I'll
[1:06:15] never leave you I'll never forsake you I
[1:06:18] won't leave you comfortless I will send
[1:06:21] you the comforter and he will guide you
[1:06:23] in all truth amen and in my name they
[1:06:27] will cast out demons they will lay their
[1:06:30] hands upon their sick and they shall
[1:06:33] recover so don't tell me God took that
[1:06:39] away I'm sorry I'm feeling at
[1:06:46] home but listen to what he says we need
[1:06:50] man who's willing to stand on what God
[1:06:54] said to be the truth truth God bless you
[1:06:57] Brothers it's an honor to be on the
[1:06:59] battlefield with real man of God that
[1:07:02] stand for the truth that called black
[1:07:04] black and white white people love it
[1:07:07] gray and no white is white and black is
[1:07:12] black I don't have black hair do
[1:07:16] I I got a big amen
[1:07:20] there but Saints soon I'm going to have
[1:07:23] black hair well I what's Brown in this
[1:07:26] but but who's willing to stand for what
[1:07:29] God said to be the
[1:07:31] truth you know Peter when they were in
[1:07:34] the
[1:07:35] boat he didn't have a six-hour
[1:07:39] sermon Jesus came walking on the water
[1:07:42] they said there's a ghost what's going
[1:07:44] on but Peter said if it is thou the
[1:07:48] scripture says Peter answered and him
[1:07:51] said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto
[1:07:54] thee on the water
[1:07:56] now Jesus didn't start well Peter you
[1:07:59] know remember when we were on the other
[1:08:01] side I told you this I told you that I
[1:08:03] told you this no he said
[1:08:07] come a short powerful word but it was
[1:08:11] sufficient for Peter to take God on his
[1:08:14] word now what about us can we take God
[1:08:18] at his word Peter just by believing one
[1:08:22] word come started walking on the word of
[1:08:25] God Amen and the water amen the
[1:08:30] laws of
[1:08:32] nature couldn't drown Peter because
[1:08:36] Peter was walking on the word come come
[1:08:40] and it was only the moment when he
[1:08:42] doubted when he saw the
[1:08:45] wave that he started drowning but listen
[1:08:49] even in that situation when we doubt or
[1:08:52] When We Fear it is still Jesus that is
[1:08:55] coming to taking our hand amen and he's
[1:08:59] still the same one for us tonight no
[1:09:02] matter how we feel only believe God's
[1:09:08] word sir you know the story
[1:09:12] about brother
[1:09:17] MOS he was carrying his
[1:09:20] Bible
[1:09:22] everywhere and the boss says mo why do
[1:09:26] you carry your
[1:09:28] Bible oh well I believe every word of
[1:09:32] it I believe it from civer to civer and
[1:09:36] even on the front and the back you know
[1:09:39] why because in the front it says holy
[1:09:43] Bible and on the inside it says Hey the
[1:09:46] boss says Hey Brother Moses you can't
[1:09:48] even read that's right
[1:09:51] boss but on the inside it says that
[1:09:54] heaven and earth pass
[1:09:57] away but that this word will never pass
[1:10:01] away so I prefer to stand upon the word
[1:10:04] of God than upon what everybody can say
[1:10:08] or anybody can say because heaven and
[1:10:10] earth will pass away but this word will
[1:10:13] never pass away why because he said I am
[1:10:18] the word I am the beginning and the end
[1:10:21] I am the all and all
[1:10:26] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:10:27] Word was with God and the girl oh
[1:10:29] Hallelujah so even if I can't read I can
[1:10:32] stand upon God's promises amen knowing
[1:10:35] without a Shadow of Doubt be like Peter
[1:10:38] stand upon the word and you see the
[1:10:40] phenomenal you see the miraculous take
[1:10:43] place in your
[1:10:45] life
[1:10:46] hallelujah amen amen so it's our it's up
[1:10:51] to us
[1:10:52] now Heaven and Earth will pass away amen
[1:10:56] 2 Corinthians says ver 10 casting down
[1:11:04] imagination Satan loves to bring things
[1:11:07] in our minds so we start
[1:11:10] imagining this brother doesn't like me
[1:11:13] the pastor he's probably speaking
[1:11:15] against me have you ever heard that
[1:11:17] brother Ray
[1:11:19] brother I thought it was only in our
[1:11:21] church you
[1:11:23] know Satan bombarded and and and becomes
[1:11:27] let's see what the word says and every
[1:11:29] High thing that exalted itself against
[1:11:32] the knowledge of God who do you think
[1:11:35] you are you have a bigger knowledge than
[1:11:38] God and all those that go against the
[1:11:40] word come
[1:11:43] on that's what Satan tried huh yeah I
[1:11:46] want a greater Kingdom I want have some
[1:11:49] I have a a greater
[1:11:51] wisdom and he was cast down and that's
[1:11:54] what he's trying to do now even now
[1:11:56] wants to pull you down but what does the
[1:11:59] word of God tells us amen casting down
[1:12:01] imagination and every High thing that
[1:12:03] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:12:05] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:12:08] thought to The Obedience of
[1:12:11] Christ that's where the greatest battle
[1:12:13] is fought amen so we have to cast down
[1:12:17] all these
[1:12:19] strongholds amen all these complexes
[1:12:23] anxiety depression
[1:12:26] unbelief everything that will become a
[1:12:29] stronghold but we have to cast it
[1:12:32] down how well just live let me give you
[1:12:35] a little Bible story
[1:12:38] Joshua gave received the word from the
[1:12:40] angel right although he knew exactly how
[1:12:43] strong the strongholds were right you
[1:12:45] with me he knew exactly the prophet said
[1:12:48] how how much cement it took how wide it
[1:12:51] was amen and all this but God knows amen
[1:12:55] he knows exactly because he knows he is
[1:12:58] the almighty amen so he said just walk
[1:13:01] around amen seven Church ages and then
[1:13:04] in the seventh Church age Seven Seals
[1:13:06] will be opened and then when you hear
[1:13:09] when you receive the open book there is
[1:13:11] rejoicing there is shouting and these
[1:13:14] walls are coming down so what about us
[1:13:18] we have received the open book so we
[1:13:21] can't Rejoice no matter what it may be
[1:13:28] no matter what it may be Brother David
[1:13:32] I've been in many prayer lines so
[1:13:37] what the pastor prayed for me many times
[1:13:40] so
[1:13:41] what where's your faith
[1:13:44] at Keep On
[1:13:46] Believing amen amen David he saw Beyond
[1:13:50] Goliath he saw the victory
[1:13:55] he didn't look to the how big he was he
[1:13:59] saw the word of God and he already
[1:14:01] worshiped God for the victory in his
[1:14:05] life my my my my we shouldn't live under
[1:14:08] our god-given privileges amen he is
[1:14:11] worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of all
[1:14:14] I am still sick oh no he said it is
[1:14:18] finished
[1:14:20] amen hallelujah amen so let us cast down
[1:14:24] all reasoning amen you know when we read
[1:14:26] Ephesians according as he had chosen Us
[1:14:29] in him before the foundation of the
[1:14:31] world so in the verse in verse four
[1:14:33] there's no mention about us doing
[1:14:36] anything I did this I did that you
[1:14:39] didn't do anything God did it from the
[1:14:42] beginning and he will bring it to the
[1:14:44] end he who started this work in me in
[1:14:48] you will accomplish it what 99.9% no to
[1:14:53] perfection
[1:14:55] brother brandham says when you pray and
[1:14:58] you speak to your mountain and even if
[1:15:00] the mountain doesn't move there's a
[1:15:02] little grain of sand that starts moving
[1:15:05] come on Church in my life amen you see
[1:15:10] amen a miracle standing
[1:15:13] here I'm not doing that to lift up
[1:15:15] brother R I'm just reminding you that
[1:15:18] God is still God Amen so he still
[1:15:22] preaches the word he still believes
[1:15:24] nothing can hold him
[1:15:28] down maybe a little gra a little piece
[1:15:31] of sand is falling but we will press on
[1:15:34] we will continue amen until we see a
[1:15:37] total Deliverance a total
[1:15:40] healing Hallelujah because when you
[1:15:44] believe what God says I am a
[1:15:47] son an air come on now that's right if
[1:15:52] anybody comes to you tonight
[1:15:55] and knocks at your door and say
[1:15:58] well you're an air to 25 million I want
[1:16:02] to keep it low you
[1:16:05] know I got you there thank
[1:16:08] you would you just say thank you close
[1:16:12] the
[1:16:13] door I'm asking you in all
[1:16:17] honesty how would you react coming here
[1:16:20] a little more you know
[1:16:26] thank you no no believe
[1:16:31] me now that ain't good brothers and
[1:16:35] sisters but now if I am a son that's
[1:16:38] what God says an air an air to
[1:16:42] everything that he
[1:16:44] has my my my so I can ask my healing I
[1:16:49] can ask my family I can ask my
[1:16:51] Deliverance I can ask whatever that is
[1:16:54] his and he said at the cross it is
[1:16:57] finished it is
[1:17:00] finished Satan take
[1:17:03] that come on
[1:17:05] church amen amen amen nothing we have
[1:17:08] done it's all what he has done so we
[1:17:11] don't need to inject anybody's ID in
[1:17:13] there it's God's Own ID about
[1:17:17] it oh think of it it's God's Own idea
[1:17:21] about it of what of his bride
[1:17:26] being blessed by every Redemptive
[1:17:32] blessing glory be to God Amen John 15
[1:17:36] says ye have not chosen me but I have
[1:17:39] chosen
[1:17:42] you you know in the natural I often give
[1:17:45] it and my wife doesn't like it but I
[1:17:47] chose her she chose me well she said
[1:17:51] yes I'm a happy man
[1:17:55] that there could be hundreds thousands
[1:17:57] it wasn't the case
[1:17:58] please I want to start doctrines here
[1:18:01] you
[1:18:03] know but one was
[1:18:05] chosen and that's what God he chose me W
[1:18:10] even brother brandham says there were a
[1:18:11] millions that are better than me but God
[1:18:15] by Grace choose me he chose me he loved
[1:18:18] me he justified me and already glorified
[1:18:22] me Hallelujah
[1:18:25] amen amen so this Bible it's not just a
[1:18:28] book that people people read it's not a
[1:18:31] book about history or a book about codes
[1:18:33] or systems or no it's the revelation of
[1:18:37] Jesus Christ amen amen amen so if we are
[1:18:42] in Christ and Christ is in us on then
[1:18:46] this is the revelation of who I
[1:18:51] am Hallelujah Glory the opening of the
[1:18:55] seals what is it revealing Jesus Christ
[1:18:59] amen now I'm a part of Jesus Christ so
[1:19:01] that reveals who I
[1:19:04] am and now my wife she has the same
[1:19:07] Authority on the check as I have that's
[1:19:12] why he says oh when you give your heart
[1:19:14] to the Lord and you be become a
[1:19:17] Christian God gives you a checkbook
[1:19:24] and
[1:19:26] it's my
[1:19:28] name is as valid as Jesus
[1:19:32] Christ because I'm his
[1:19:35] bride if my wife when I was in Uganda i
[1:19:39] i i Ed the same example and they really
[1:19:42] caught it because if my wife goes to the
[1:19:44] bank and says hey I want to cash this or
[1:19:47] or pay that or whatever under what
[1:19:50] Authority I miss
[1:19:52] meire now when you go ask anything in my
[1:19:58] name he says I will give it to you so
[1:20:01] under what name do we come the name of
[1:20:04] Jesus if you ask anything you ask it in
[1:20:07] the name of Jesus why because oh my name
[1:20:11] is Miss
[1:20:13] Jesus come on church it's about time the
[1:20:16] bride knows her position amen amen and
[1:20:20] if God listen I'm going ahead of myself
[1:20:22] now but that's okay
[1:20:25] brother M talks about Whack Him you've
[1:20:28] heard
[1:20:29] him you whack
[1:20:32] him and if if a little
[1:20:35] parasite Internet
[1:20:38] site
[1:20:39] opposite anything comes you whack him
[1:20:42] again and you whack him and you whack
[1:20:45] him I miss Jesus Christ it is written by
[1:20:48] his stripes I am already healed it is
[1:20:51] written ask and you shall receive come
[1:20:54] on Saints that's
[1:20:57] right hallelujah hallelujah amen so this
[1:21:03] Bible Prophet says has become a new book
[1:21:05] a new Bible now there's many
[1:21:07] translations of the Bible many many
[1:21:11] languages but you know what translation
[1:21:13] I
[1:21:14] prefer the open book
[1:21:17] Bible so there's no discussion anymore
[1:21:20] about King James or or or whatever
[1:21:23] version you may have it's the open book
[1:21:26] Bible this Bible has become a new book
[1:21:29] because every type these were types but
[1:21:32] I'm the manifestation of the type
[1:21:35] Hallelujah Ruth and bis Abraham and
[1:21:38] Sarah amen Esther come on Church there
[1:21:41] are types but we are the manifestation
[1:21:44] of the bride and the bridegroom and we
[1:21:47] are the living manifestation of God's
[1:21:52] word Glory Glory Glory
[1:21:55] amen God's thoughts are
[1:21:57] Eternal amen and God is unchangeable in
[1:22:00] both Essence and behavior he is
[1:22:03] omnicient listen he has never had a new
[1:22:06] thought W think of
[1:22:09] it he has never had a new thought about
[1:22:14] you Hallelujah that oh I Rejoice about
[1:22:17] that because I keep saying you know I'm
[1:22:20] I'm
[1:22:21] I'm I'm good for nothing
[1:22:25] I'll never make
[1:22:26] it I really I'm a loser you know how
[1:22:29] Satan puts it maybe I'm the only one I'm
[1:22:32] being honest here
[1:22:34] tonight but now here God tells
[1:22:37] us I never had another
[1:22:43] thought
[1:22:50] Hallelujah come on Saints give a good
[1:22:54] nothing out to
[1:22:56] Satan that's for each and
[1:22:59] everyone amen amen thus the thoughts of
[1:23:03] God are Eternal and they are
[1:23:06] real amen the David writes in the Psalm
[1:23:10] 139 for thou Hast possessed my Reigns
[1:23:13] thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb
[1:23:15] I will praise thee he's worthy of my
[1:23:20] praise amen for I am fearfully and
[1:23:23] wonderfully
[1:23:25] made brother Wayne We Are wonderfully
[1:23:28] made and here Satan tries to put
[1:23:31] complexes I want to be taller I want to
[1:23:33] be shorter I want to be wider I want to
[1:23:36] be older I want to be
[1:23:38] younger I want to have white hair I want
[1:23:40] to have black hair come on that's
[1:23:43] nonsense from Satan because the thoughts
[1:23:46] about us are
[1:23:49] wonderful
[1:23:51] hallelujah amen he and wonderfully made
[1:23:53] Marvel are thy works and that my soul
[1:23:57] knoweth right
[1:24:01] well my substance was not hid from thee
[1:24:05] when I was made in secret and curiously
[1:24:07] wrought in the lowest part of the earth
[1:24:09] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[1:24:13] being unperfect and in thy book all my
[1:24:16] members were written which in
[1:24:19] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:24:22] there was none of them woo
[1:24:26] hey I'm not a creature of time huh we're
[1:24:29] creatures of
[1:24:31] Eternity how precious also are thy
[1:24:33] thoughts unto me oh God how great is the
[1:24:36] sum of them and in the Amplified it says
[1:24:39] I will give verse 14 give thanks and
[1:24:42] praise to you for I am fearfully and
[1:24:44] wonderfully made wonderful are your
[1:24:46] Works in verse 15 he says when I was
[1:24:49] being formed in secret and intricately
[1:24:52] and skillfully formed formed as if
[1:24:56] embroidered with many
[1:25:01] colors that's why you know Satan attacks
[1:25:04] the five-fold
[1:25:06] ministry and you know what the prophet
[1:25:08] says there are God's fine needle
[1:25:16] work because we are being dressed the
[1:25:20] bride is being
[1:25:22] dressed with God's word
[1:25:25] we become the word the word becomes us
[1:25:28] amen and that's the the duty of the
[1:25:31] servants God's servants Amen to find
[1:25:33] needle work oh there's much opposition
[1:25:36] amen but if we stand on the Solid Rock
[1:25:40] Amen no demon of hell can get say
[1:25:42] anything against us because there will
[1:25:44] be a bride without spot or
[1:25:48] wrinkle
[1:25:49] Hallelujah glory be to God Amen
[1:25:53] embroided with many colors that makes me
[1:25:56] think of
[1:25:59] Joseph
[1:26:01] hallelujah amen the prophet says amen I
[1:26:04] lost my handkerchief here here we go got
[1:26:05] it back
[1:26:07] sorry says Moses Jeremiah John each one
[1:26:10] of these were God's Eternal thoughts
[1:26:12] expressed in their
[1:26:15] season okay let me bring it to your
[1:26:17] front door what's your name
[1:26:19] brother
[1:26:21] Aaron Benjamin
[1:26:24] Mah so now in their season but now you
[1:26:28] call your
[1:26:29] name those were God's
[1:26:31] thoughts for my
[1:26:33] season God chose us amen for this season
[1:26:38] what a glorious season because this is a
[1:26:41] season where Time and Eternity is
[1:26:42] blending together amen we are even
[1:26:45] bumping in the Holy Angels and oh in one
[1:26:49] one split moment I'm going to be changed
[1:26:52] in a twinkling of an eye amen but we
[1:26:54] need to believe it not understand it
[1:26:57] with our head but say this is for me
[1:27:00] listen to what he says amen and each one
[1:27:02] of these thoughts were God's Eternal
[1:27:04] thoughts expressed in its season he had
[1:27:07] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:27:09] of the world that means that we were
[1:27:11] right there with him in the mind and in
[1:27:14] the thoughts of God before the
[1:27:16] foundation of the
[1:27:18] world now that gives an eternal quality
[1:27:21] to the elect
[1:27:24] amen that's right an eternal quality
[1:27:27] although Satan wants us to believe his
[1:27:30] nonsense mhm I'm continuing here amen
[1:27:34] Amen brother Ram says amen that he took
[1:27:38] a picture of us yes sir sir and he says
[1:27:42] the picture is the main
[1:27:46] thing you know
[1:27:48] Satan is a
[1:27:51] perverter he perverts everything yeah
[1:27:54] that God put already there you'll see
[1:28:00] when was I taken when was it taken that
[1:28:02] picture before there was a foundation of
[1:28:04] the world it was put in God's Great file
[1:28:08] in God's great photo album so I don't
[1:28:12] care what they would do with me they
[1:28:14] cannot destroy that he uses the word
[1:28:17] profile nowadays on the internet you
[1:28:19] have to have a profile what does your
[1:28:21] profile say
[1:28:25] very simple my profile says I come from
[1:28:27] God and I go back to
[1:28:32] God you see how Satan uses
[1:28:38] everything how many likes and unlikes do
[1:28:41] you have are you an influencer oh Satan
[1:28:44] he definitely
[1:28:46] is I don't need the thousands of likes I
[1:28:49] have already one
[1:28:51] like that's from my heavenly father
[1:28:53] that's said I chose you I elected you I
[1:28:57] loved you before the foundation of the
[1:28:59] world and here Satan brings such an
[1:29:02] anointing where people oh I need a
[1:29:04] thousand lights at a million lights and
[1:29:06] this and that and the other and they go
[1:29:08] into depression because oh somebody said
[1:29:10] your your your pants wasn't right or the
[1:29:12] color I don't care if my tide doesn't
[1:29:14] match my
[1:29:15] suits I want my experience to match
[1:29:18] God's
[1:29:20] word and that should be the case from
[1:29:22] all of us
[1:29:25] amen amen amen amen hallelujah so God
[1:29:29] put this picture in his photo album yes
[1:29:33] sir I take the often the the
[1:29:36] example I used that brother Tims the
[1:29:38] other day and the brother said how many
[1:29:43] remember the moment you bre read it your
[1:29:47] first
[1:29:48] breath anybody good there was one
[1:29:51] brother say see you after church brother
[1:29:57] so nobody remembers pictures were
[1:30:01] taken one year two years we were but Dad
[1:30:05] he's
[1:30:07] explaining son this is
[1:30:10] you you're David David
[1:30:14] Meyer you're my
[1:30:19] son and I
[1:30:21] believe although I've never seen I saw
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:25] picture I saw the picture of me and I
[1:30:29] believed what Dad said now what about
[1:30:32] our heavenly father that said I took a
[1:30:35] picture of you at your
[1:30:38] best what was the best when I was in his
[1:30:41] thoughts and
[1:30:43] attributes and that's what he has the
[1:30:45] profile of me so it doesn't matter if I
[1:30:48] get wrinkled if I get stoed down if I if
[1:30:51] I even fall because seven times just can
[1:30:54] fall but seven times he stands up amen
[1:30:57] so it doesn't matter what Satan tells
[1:30:59] you even tonight what matters is what my
[1:31:02] heavenly father tells me and you remind
[1:31:05] Satan that God has a profile amen where
[1:31:08] I was
[1:31:12] perfect amen that's what is going on
[1:31:15] that's why the book has been opened the
[1:31:17] seals have been revealed so we can have
[1:31:20] perfect faith in what God tells us
[1:31:24] hallelujah amen amen amen amen yes sir
[1:31:28] Hallelujah just to think amen we're not
[1:31:30] here by chance but we are here by God's
[1:31:34] choosing people say I would love to live
[1:31:37] when brother Brandon was here yeah I
[1:31:40] would have loved to be with Abraham yeah
[1:31:43] but we're living in a most glorious
[1:31:47] time think about it when will be on the
[1:31:50] other side when you have this big table
[1:31:54] I I have a chair there's my name written
[1:31:56] on it so I have no worries my name is on
[1:31:59] it and if you dare sit on it oh you get
[1:32:01] in trouble that's my my
[1:32:04] seat so they
[1:32:07] amen I love it preachers
[1:32:12] preach so there Abraham Joshua Caleb all
[1:32:17] of them you name them they will come
[1:32:19] tell us tell us how was it in the
[1:32:24] darkest age where all hell was on
[1:32:30] Earth but you have been given an open
[1:32:34] book to withstand everything that Satan
[1:32:38] will put against you because he said he
[1:32:42] will raise a standard so no matter what
[1:32:45] comes our way he raises a standard and
[1:32:48] he gave us the full revelation of
[1:32:51] himself including his brother
[1:32:55] so we can have perfect faith not in a
[1:32:57] nice story but in a
[1:32:59] reality because that's why the prophet
[1:33:02] says it's
[1:33:04] real many people have had knowledge but
[1:33:07] it has to go here in the
[1:33:09] soul amen and you all you you cannot
[1:33:12] come in the family you are born in the
[1:33:15] family you cannot just come to church
[1:33:17] and say my mom my dad and so on God
[1:33:20] doesn't have grandchildren right
[1:33:24] you must be born
[1:33:26] again there's no other way
[1:33:29] out amen amen amen so oh Hallelujah he
[1:33:35] he his hand formed you he made you the
[1:33:37] person you are he Compares you to no one
[1:33:40] else think of it where
[1:33:43] everybody I prefer you Ty I prefer you
[1:33:47] car that's Satan he wants you compare
[1:33:51] this one with the other one and
[1:33:54] and God tells us that his thoughts about
[1:33:56] me about us are
[1:33:59] perfect wonderfully
[1:34:02] made Hallelujah come on
[1:34:05] Saints he Compares you to no one else
[1:34:08] you are one of a
[1:34:11] kind my don't take that in the B sense
[1:34:13] huh he's one of a kind no you are one of
[1:34:17] a kind because you one in a million God
[1:34:20] chose you one in a million they were
[1:34:23] like I said said there are many better
[1:34:24] than me but nevertheless God chose
[1:34:28] me amen you lack nothing his grace can
[1:34:32] give you he has allowed you to be here
[1:34:35] at this time of History to fulfill his
[1:34:38] special
[1:34:40] purpose in this
[1:34:42] generation that's why Jeremiah 29 says
[1:34:45] for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:34:47] toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of
[1:34:50] peace and not of evil all right to give
[1:34:53] you you that's right an expected
[1:34:57] end what's that end anybody
[1:35:03] knows I come from God I go back to
[1:35:07] God the good news is I want to remind
[1:35:10] Satan I know his
[1:35:14] end Satan likes to talk about your past
[1:35:18] you've done this that the other and the
[1:35:19] list is
[1:35:20] big but you just tonight remind Satan
[1:35:24] about his very near
[1:35:28] future you remind him that his place is
[1:35:31] under your
[1:35:33] feet come on Saints because it ain't
[1:35:36] your power ain't your strength but it
[1:35:39] his power greater is he that is in you
[1:35:42] than he that is against you if you can
[1:35:44] only believe amen it doesn't matter how
[1:35:47] big your muscles are but Faith fate
[1:35:50] speaks and Satan has to flee
[1:35:56] hallelujah amen amen amen that's why
[1:36:00] amen he says what is the book of
[1:36:03] redemption the book of redemption the
[1:36:05] title deed the abstract title deed that
[1:36:08] means it search all the way back to its
[1:36:11] beginning
[1:36:15] Hallelujah in Redemption means all legal
[1:36:20] possessions any lawyers
[1:36:22] here no nobody dares to
[1:36:28] okay all legal possession to all that
[1:36:31] was lost by Adam and Eve oh my brother
[1:36:35] brandham claps his hands together once
[1:36:37] what it ought to do to the born again
[1:36:40] Christian come on Saints how many Born
[1:36:44] Again Christians are we here tonight
[1:36:46] amen so what it ought to do to us
[1:36:50] everything they lost everything they
[1:36:53] lost
[1:36:55] Hallelujah when Adam was sitting there
[1:36:58] oh I need some shade he didn't have to
[1:37:01] move himself he just said tree come on
[1:37:08] here and God restored us back to that
[1:37:13] Authority oh I I hear the critics you
[1:37:16] know brother DAV it one day we'll have
[1:37:20] it the prophet says you don't have to
[1:37:22] put it in the future
[1:37:24] we won't need it in millon
[1:37:26] now now because with the full
[1:37:30] restoration of the word come full
[1:37:32] restoration of the power the problem is
[1:37:35] that we I'm including myself don't want
[1:37:39] to take God at his
[1:37:41] word
[1:37:44] uhhuh does that mean we lack Faith No
[1:37:47] but what's our attitude even when God
[1:37:51] that's why yes God bless you brother I I
[1:37:53] love him very much he's a dear buddy but
[1:37:56] he's a real hero of the
[1:37:59] faith you know we can read in Hebrews 11
[1:38:02] by
[1:38:03] faith Abel by faith Abraham by faith
[1:38:06] Joshua by Faith by Faith by faith you
[1:38:08] know the
[1:38:09] story let me add another book of Acts by
[1:38:12] faith read
[1:38:15] around you know why by faith you know
[1:38:18] what it stands for fear ain't in this
[1:38:21] house
[1:38:25] and only
[1:38:26] believe now what about us it's not only
[1:38:29] for brother
[1:38:32] wrong is your life so
[1:38:37] perfect but by faith Aaron by faith
[1:38:41] Benjamin by faith Caleb by
[1:38:44] faith you cast down reasoning and by
[1:38:48] faith you shall
[1:38:51] receive because fear ain't in this
[1:38:55] house there's only faith in what God
[1:39:00] says let's continue for I didn't even
[1:39:02] know when I started brother Wayne so
[1:39:04] give me a
[1:39:09] sign you didn't become Christian just by
[1:39:12] coincidence before you were born God
[1:39:14] ordained you to be a
[1:39:17] Christian from before the foundation of
[1:39:19] the world you know what predestination
[1:39:22] means amen predestination of anything it
[1:39:24] was preaw by
[1:39:28] God may I continue a little while so
[1:39:31] don't stumble at the word predestination
[1:39:33] amen God had thoughts and his word are
[1:39:37] his thoughts expressed so how thankful
[1:39:40] we can be that we have an open book that
[1:39:43] Christ himself came down to he open the
[1:39:46] seals thereof to show us our true
[1:39:50] identity amen I'm not Swiss I'm not
[1:39:53] Belgian I'm not American I'm not
[1:39:56] Canadian I'm not African I'm not
[1:39:59] Chinese come on now I don't have all
[1:40:02] these identities no I have one true
[1:40:04] identity I am a son an air of God
[1:40:08] through Christ
[1:40:10] Jesus that's why we can walk boldly in
[1:40:13] face of all demons knowing that God will
[1:40:16] never fail
[1:40:20] us Satan would love us to believe that
[1:40:23] the days of Miracles are
[1:40:26] passed Brother David we've heard that
[1:40:29] before it has to be more than hear about
[1:40:32] it it has to be a personal
[1:40:36] experience each and everyone young and
[1:40:40] old go ye all into the
[1:40:45] world to do what to testify that God is
[1:40:49] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:54] amen so all people will never be able to
[1:40:59] see it as the prophet saying not Brother
[1:41:02] David all people wasn't in the beginning
[1:41:05] in God's thoughts so that's why people
[1:41:08] love to fuss and even people want to say
[1:41:11] you're in it you're not in it nobody
[1:41:14] knows but God himself and he says I will
[1:41:16] not lose
[1:41:21] anyl now what's the to
[1:41:23] how do you know amen when you believe
[1:41:26] every word of God you don't start with
[1:41:30] your own interpretation you don't start
[1:41:32] with your own Doctrine you just believe
[1:41:35] the word the pure non-adulterated word
[1:41:38] of God that's why the bride she will be
[1:41:41] a virgin word prde she's part of
[1:41:47] him
[1:41:49] hallelujah amen amen amen so election
[1:41:52] looks back to for knowledge and
[1:41:53] predestination looks to Destiny amen
[1:41:56] Listen Now by Fall knowledge he forsaw
[1:41:59] us that that's the power of
[1:42:02] God if Einstein could say you know I
[1:42:06] want to know God's
[1:42:08] thoughts the rest are all not of of non
[1:42:13] importance and now
[1:42:15] he Lord by for knowledge foresaw us
[1:42:19] knowing that he was a Sav savior
[1:42:21] self-existent he looked down and he saw
[1:42:24] everyone that would accept
[1:42:27] it thank you
[1:42:30] Jesus and then by doing
[1:42:33] so he said to save that the only way I
[1:42:36] can do it will it will be to come myself
[1:42:39] be made flesh and take the sin of man
[1:42:42] upon me and to die for him that I may be
[1:42:47] the one that's
[1:42:50] worshiped listen to that where Satan the
[1:42:54] Antichrist Spirit today wants to take
[1:42:57] all the glory out of the
[1:42:59] church where Satan wants to have dead
[1:43:04] churches but Ray brother Wayne I love
[1:43:07] the church Al
[1:43:09] alive and ain't afraid to
[1:43:12] worship you know people say my nature
[1:43:16] okay sorry your nature if you say I'm a
[1:43:19] son an air your jeans go way back
[1:43:25] where were thou before I laid the
[1:43:27] foundation of the world I was doing what
[1:43:31] I was rejoicing I was worshiping I was
[1:43:34] giving Glory the prophet says I was
[1:43:37] having a good time with Jesus when I saw
[1:43:40] the Plan of
[1:43:41] Redemption come on Saints maybe we have
[1:43:45] spiritual Amnesia but the time has come
[1:43:47] the word is being given that w i
[1:43:50] remember I was praising God God thank
[1:43:54] you thank you I'm saved I'm
[1:43:57] redeemed I am
[1:44:00] it
[1:44:01] Hallelujah I'm not ashamed of the
[1:44:07] Gospel that goes for all
[1:44:13] nationalities
[1:44:15] Glory so in very plain language I love
[1:44:18] the plain language is that okay I know
[1:44:21] you you know it the true bride of Christ
[1:44:24] was in the mind of God eternity no not
[1:44:28] expressed until each came forth in the
[1:44:31] designated decreed
[1:44:33] season as each member came forward it
[1:44:35] became expressed and took its place in
[1:44:37] the body does the bride is the literal
[1:44:40] spoken word seed
[1:44:44] bride think of
[1:44:47] it what do you think Satan can do
[1:44:49] against
[1:44:51] that yeah preach with me brothers and
[1:44:56] sisters when the Lord said let there be
[1:45:00] light even up to today Satan cannot hold
[1:45:04] the sun stop the Sun from rising up in
[1:45:07] the
[1:45:09] morning so now instead of when you rise
[1:45:11] up and oh I have to go to work I have to
[1:45:14] go to school it's going to be horrible I
[1:45:16] have an exam coming
[1:45:18] and yeah we're all yeah we have our
[1:45:21] human part when you see that
[1:45:24] Sunrise just remind Satan Satan you
[1:45:28] couldn't stop God's word and you can't
[1:45:31] stop it
[1:45:32] now I am a son I am an heir of God
[1:45:37] through Christ so Satan you take all
[1:45:40] your nonsense get me behind me I am a
[1:45:43] Son of God I am a daughter of
[1:45:47] God and you whack him and you whack him
[1:45:50] again come on are you in the boxing
[1:45:53] business oh yes I am I'm in The Killing
[1:45:56] business killing every demon everything
[1:45:59] every stronghold that goes against the
[1:46:02] word of
[1:46:03] God that's what we have been ordained
[1:46:06] for God called us to destroy Satan's
[1:46:09] kingdom I'm sick and tired of all these
[1:46:13] demons trying to withhold God's
[1:46:18] people cuz the moment you hear the
[1:46:21] Jubilee trumpet what's the Jubilee
[1:46:24] trumpet the opening of the word that's
[1:46:28] right that's why the bride's Revival is
[1:46:30] a reality that's right it's not an
[1:46:33] intellectual reality many people will
[1:46:35] try to explain you no don't give me the
[1:46:38] explanation let God manifest reveal
[1:46:42] himself and that will make all the
[1:46:44] difference amen amen amen that I might
[1:46:48] be the one
[1:46:50] worshiped he's the only one that is
[1:46:52] worthy worthy of all our praise amen so
[1:46:56] we did not become seed by repaper we
[1:46:58] were seed and therefore were born for
[1:46:59] the only elect can be
[1:47:04] reor and the and the the others there's
[1:47:07] nothing that can be reborn can be
[1:47:11] quickened by the quickening
[1:47:13] power and so were you sons of God and
[1:47:16] daughters AG go before there even was a
[1:47:18] moon a star or a molecule
[1:47:24] isn't that something for there's only
[1:47:25] one form of eternal life and that was
[1:47:28] you
[1:47:30] before my think of it
[1:47:33] Saints you can have five years of age or
[1:47:37] 100 but I was
[1:47:40] before that was you before and I'm going
[1:47:43] back to that amen as sure as Eugene had
[1:47:47] to be in your father before your natural
[1:47:49] birth your spiritual Gene had to be in
[1:47:51] God because you're an ex expression of
[1:47:53] the attributes of his thoughts before
[1:47:56] the foundation of the
[1:47:58] world Listen Now the definition of a
[1:48:02] gene probably have some doctors or
[1:48:06] nurses a heredity units controlling a
[1:48:11] particular
[1:48:12] character you see heredity means we have
[1:48:16] an inheritance a
[1:48:18] Heritage okay a particular character a
[1:48:22] Christlike
[1:48:25] character this genetic element
[1:48:28] corresponds to a segment of DNA or RNA
[1:48:32] located at a specific location called
[1:48:34] Locust hey I searched it up it's not my
[1:48:38] intellect
[1:48:40] h a specific location on a chromosome
[1:48:44] and each region of the DNA that produces
[1:48:48] a functional RNA molecule is a gene
[1:48:52] the nucleus of the cell is the library
[1:48:57] which contains all the hereditary
[1:49:00] Heritage of the
[1:49:02] individual my the
[1:49:05] chromosome is a book of this
[1:49:08] library and the onepage gene of the
[1:49:18] book my name was written in the book in
[1:49:21] the Lamb's Book of of life before the
[1:49:24] foundation of the world I had a page
[1:49:27] with my name on it amen and that's my
[1:49:31] Gene that comes from God that God placed
[1:49:34] in me in you before the foundation of
[1:49:37] the
[1:49:38] world Satan you
[1:49:51] lost than of it people say the prophet
[1:49:54] had no degree talk badly now what about
[1:49:57] me then in my
[1:50:01] accent the prophet says somebody has to
[1:50:04] leave you something God before the
[1:50:06] foundation of the world he left you
[1:50:09] something that's right a name written on
[1:50:13] the book when the lamb was would be
[1:50:15] slain and you would recognize
[1:50:18] it glory be to God what a privilege
[1:50:22] people we are that's why he came back in
[1:50:26] this final
[1:50:28] generation put one feet on the see one
[1:50:31] on the land amen and he opened the book
[1:50:35] but now who did he open the book for for
[1:50:38] his bride and what did he say in
[1:50:40] Revelation 108 go take the
[1:50:43] book take the book that is open you eat
[1:50:47] it so you become it your Amnesia will be
[1:50:51] gone you will know that I come from God
[1:50:54] and I go back to
[1:50:56] God you will know that greater is he
[1:50:59] that is in you than he that is against
[1:51:03] you oh isn't he wonderful amen amen amen
[1:51:07] amen I'm glad my name is on it says a
[1:51:10] prophet amen that my name is written in
[1:51:12] heaven on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:51:14] that's the who is
[1:51:17] who oh my my my my hey is it still okay
[1:51:21] I know it's fr hey we have a whole
[1:51:23] weekend and say I have the jet Lake you
[1:51:26] don't but when the anointing is there I
[1:51:29] don't care amen because under the
[1:51:31] anointing of God Anything Can Happen
[1:51:34] amen they were gathered in the upper
[1:51:36] room oh with one motive one objective
[1:51:40] Let the Fire Fall they receive one
[1:51:43] promise only one promise but what about
[1:51:46] us we have a book full of promises and
[1:51:50] every promise in the book is mine every
[1:51:53] chapter every verse every line come on
[1:51:56] Saints in moments like
[1:52:00] these they stood upon the word with one
[1:52:03] promise right and a mighty rushing wind
[1:52:06] came down amen and they were all filled
[1:52:10] with the Holy Ghost amen brothers and
[1:52:13] sisters amen they were so anointed they
[1:52:17] were walking like drunk and now people
[1:52:19] don't like to be drunk I'm talking about
[1:52:22] the wine of stimulation
[1:52:27] uhhuh but that's what it
[1:52:30] does Brother David no
[1:52:33] no the somebody called me a bramus the
[1:52:37] other day yeah because I used the quote
[1:52:40] BR brandham when he was talking about
[1:52:41] the upper room they were bouncing
[1:52:43] jumping out of the windows and the
[1:52:46] door the Bible doesn't say that that was
[1:52:49] his human part now let me tell you was
[1:52:51] that a human part when he went in the
[1:52:54] back part of his
[1:52:55] mind don't give me that nonsense that's
[1:52:58] Satan trying to influence you amen so
[1:53:01] you want to stay people think they're
[1:53:04] free and they're
[1:53:06] chained chained but I heard the Jubilee
[1:53:10] trumpet sound I received the open book I
[1:53:15] know I'm free I know I'm redeemed I know
[1:53:18] I'm
[1:53:20] saved I am his and he is
[1:53:24] mine there's something that Satan hates
[1:53:28] that's the
[1:53:30] Oneness oh yes that's why he says when
[1:53:33] the pride would know her position the
[1:53:36] Rapture will take place believe me oh
[1:53:40] when you know when you leave this place
[1:53:44] and when Satan
[1:53:45] comes brother brandham talks about I
[1:53:48] don't know if it's 10,000 volts or
[1:53:51] 100,000 but when he comes near to
[1:53:54] you because you're so charged you're so
[1:53:58] the Dynamics on the mechanics people
[1:54:01] think it's just an
[1:54:03] emotion uhuh oh no we have the mechanics
[1:54:07] and he never took the Dynamics away he
[1:54:10] says I will send the Dynamics upon the
[1:54:13] mechanics and that oh yes that will
[1:54:17] Rapture
[1:54:19] us people think with their intellectual
[1:54:21] knowledge will be raptured I'm sorry to
[1:54:24] say your mechanics won't do
[1:54:34] it maybe you don't love me for that but
[1:54:37] it's still the
[1:54:43] truth hory and they sung a new
[1:54:47] song thou are worthy to take the book
[1:54:50] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:54:53] was slain and H has redeemed us to God
[1:54:56] by the blood out of every Kindred every
[1:54:59] tongue and people and nation and has
[1:55:02] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[1:55:06] and we shall reign on the earth you know
[1:55:09] as priests we give a sacrifice of
[1:55:16] praise he even says when you don't feel
[1:55:19] like doing that's right m
[1:55:23] but when you
[1:55:24] hear when you hear from your theophany
[1:55:27] when you hear where are you coming from
[1:55:30] amen when you hear these divinely
[1:55:33] mystery truths now revealed you can but
[1:55:37] Rejoice because Satan is out of the
[1:55:40] picture Satan has nothing to say he's
[1:55:43] but a
[1:55:46] bluff he's but a bluff in your
[1:55:49] life but kicking him out
[1:55:54] give him the 1000,000
[1:55:58] volts hallelujah amen listen few more
[1:56:02] moments what was it
[1:56:05] 7:30 help me out
[1:56:08] okay the Angels the cherubim the 4 and2
[1:56:11] Elders the Beast everything uncrowned
[1:56:14] themselves fell down before the throne
[1:56:16] and said worthy are
[1:56:20] thou and here people in the message with
[1:56:23] all due respect I love you whoever is
[1:56:26] streaming I love you but are afraid to
[1:56:29] worship God to thank
[1:56:34] God worthy are
[1:56:38] thou to take the
[1:56:41] book John says and we can read it in
[1:56:44] Revelation if nobody can take the book
[1:56:48] everything is lost that's right we are
[1:56:55] lost but let's continue and see what it
[1:56:58] does and he says worthy are thou John
[1:57:02] said everything in
[1:57:07] Heaven Come on think of
[1:57:10] it when I take my plane on Monday I want
[1:57:13] to hear you
[1:57:14] shout because I'm going to be in heaven
[1:57:23] everything in Heaven and Earth heard me
[1:57:33] hollering people told me Brother David
[1:57:35] you screamed too loud I have hey I
[1:57:38] didn't scream too
[1:57:40] loud I rather lose my voice to give
[1:57:42] glory to God because the the Bible tells
[1:57:46] us when the woman came to the well when
[1:57:49] she was talking about worship he says
[1:57:52] the Lord is seeking those that worship
[1:57:54] Him in spirit and in
[1:57:58] truth the truth is being preached the
[1:58:01] pure word and it's up to us oh I'm not
[1:58:05] afraid to holler because worthy are
[1:58:08] thou I'm not worthy no I'm not but you
[1:58:12] are worthy you alone is worthy of all my
[1:58:18] praise and if praise which is a type of
[1:58:22] Joshua if praise can destroy the walls
[1:58:25] the biggest wall there ever was maybe
[1:58:28] you should start worshipping in spirit
[1:58:31] and in truth so you destroy all the
[1:58:33] strongholds that want to keep you bound
[1:58:37] because the desire of God is to seek
[1:58:39] God's people free free indeed he who the
[1:58:44] Son of God sets free is free
[1:58:48] indeed glory be to God Amen amen amen
[1:58:53] and Earth heard me hollering amen
[1:58:55] screaming Hallelujah and praises to
[1:58:58] God their names was in the book to be
[1:59:01] revealed and the lamb had revealed
[1:59:05] it think of it you want to talk about a
[1:59:08] happy
[1:59:11] time people take that it's in the bridge
[1:59:14] people they yeah you know that's for
[1:59:17] brother Brandon you know when he he
[1:59:20] received the thir pool the opening of
[1:59:23] the word no no no no it's not for
[1:59:27] brother brandom
[1:59:33] only talk about a happy time when the
[1:59:36] seals broke John which is a type of the
[1:59:39] Bride must have looked in and seen past
[1:59:44] the curtain of
[1:59:45] time and said there's
[1:59:50] John Hallelujah
[1:59:53] Hallelujah and when you go to the angel

[2:11:18] back to my former estate of
[2:11:23] condition what is my former state of
[2:11:27] condition where were thou before I laid

[2:12:16] it's brother Wayne Brother Ray whether
[2:12:18] it's brother Ron whe brother whoever if
[2:12:20] there's one it's going to be
[2:12:22] me always that that determined to
[2:12:25] receive from God young people old people
[2:12:27] whoever brother sister do we come in
[2:12:30] God's house knowing that he is still the
[2:12:32] same for
[2:12:39] us all the joy we
[2:12:42] missed Prophet says do you know that
[2:12:44] there are some things that we have to do
[2:12:48] that God cannot do until we do
[2:12:56] it he furnishes the energy but we have
[2:13:00] to do the
[2:13:02] job what job take God at his word I
[2:13:06] believe God when you hear the word I
[2:13:10] answer I put myself in
[2:13:13] action here I
[2:13:16] am and Mary heard the word she didn't
[2:13:19] say well that technically it's not
[2:13:22] possible science can prove that it's not
[2:13:25] possible what did she say Let It Be
[2:13:28] according to Thy
[2:13:30] word and she went
[2:13:32] testify think of it she went testify
[2:13:36] that she was going to have a baby
[2:13:38] without knowing a man and you know for
[2:13:41] people that were nonbelievers that was
[2:13:44] oh we going to Stone
[2:13:48] you but she didn't look at what the law
[2:13:52] could say she didn't look to what the
[2:13:54] people could say she listened to what
[2:13:56] God Said and what God says oh that
[2:14:01] produced a Revival in her life
[2:14:05] Hallelujah and when she went to
[2:14:12] Elizabeth when she said his name will be
[2:14:16] Jesus he leaped for joy lifee
[2:14:21] the first time Jesus was pronounced It
[2:14:23] produced life we're going to ask oh
[2:14:26] brother John you know he's the first
[2:14:31] witness of the power of the name of
[2:14:36] Jesus now who wants to be
[2:14:40] next because in the name of Jesus we
[2:14:43] cast down every Dem oh yes in the name
[2:14:46] of Jesus we have the
[2:14:49] victory but we need PE people like the
[2:14:51] prophet says we have he furnishes the
[2:14:54] energy but we've got to do the
[2:14:58] job who's willing to stand
[2:15:02] and do God's job God's work on Earth he
[2:15:06] says we are his hands we are his eyes we
[2:15:10] are his
[2:15:11] mouth so who's willing to say Let Let It
[2:15:15] Be according to your your word
[2:15:21] musicians you can come Why Don't We
[2:15:26] Stand redeem is not to create something
[2:15:30] new it is to bring back that which has
[2:15:34] already
[2:15:36] been that's why this word is so precious
[2:15:39] to
[2:15:40] me because it
[2:15:42] reminds me my spiritual
[2:15:46] Amnesia when I hear
[2:15:49] it that's God
[2:15:51] speaking it takes all doubt away that's
[2:15:56] why he says faith cometh by hearing
[2:16:00] hearing of the word of
[2:16:07] God maybe if you can play softly I'm no
[2:16:11] longer a slave to fear you know that
[2:16:14] song I am a Son of
[2:16:19] God he put on name in the book as
[2:16:26] redeemed so what are you scared
[2:16:30] about let me ask you that question what
[2:16:33] are you scared about even tonight what
[2:16:35] is your need it's Friday night we want
[2:16:38] to wait until Saturday we want to need

[2:16:52] he told us tonight you're my son you're
[2:16:56] an air you're my
[2:16:59] daughter I know Satan is fighting but
[2:17:02] fight him
[2:17:04] back and determine this is my
[2:17:12] moment Micah the
[2:17:16] prophet where de brandom talks about a
[2:17:19] woman
[2:17:22] he says alcoholics you you see what God
[2:17:26] can

[2:18:34] the power of
[2:18:36] God that took that tumor out of
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:47] her think of it a woman
[2:18:52] and took God at his
[2:18:54] word so full of the
[2:18:57] glory she couldn't even
[2:19:00] speak her mother
[2:19:03] tongue because she wanted to give glory
[2:19:05] to
[2:19:06] God the power of

[2:48:12] getting a whipping from a guy that don't
[2:48:13] have any
[2:48:16] lungs and then the devil threw caner on
[2:48:19] him and God proved the cancer can't kill
[2:48:22] you you don't go to God's getting ready
[2:48:25] for you to go that's the only time you
