[48:58] okay thank you um God bless you everyone
[49:02] brother Wayne had such a wonderful
[49:03] introduction it's just truly an honor
[49:06] and a privilege to be here brother Wayne
[49:07] has been I would say a mentor of mine
[49:10] for many years I think we got to know
[49:12] brother Wayne in 2008 he came to Calgary
[49:16] and uh we just formed a friendship there
[49:19] and it's just been a wonderful time he's
[49:21] been a real encouragement and a real
[49:24] friend to to me and and the assembly in
[49:26] Calgary
[49:27] and uh just want to bring you greetings
[49:29] from the assembly in Calgary Calgary
[49:31] Living Word assembly and uh sister
[49:34] Shelly specifically requested that we
[49:36] bring
[49:37] greetings and uh so yeah I just want to
[49:40] thank brother Dwayne brother Ry brother
[49:43] Nathan for their Hospitality it's been a
[49:45] wonderful time and everyone else who has
[49:48] looked after us it's just been a real
[49:50] blessing to be here so far and I know
[49:52] that we're just we're not even getting
[49:54] started yet so I am certainly excited
[49:58] and a little nervous if you couldn't
[50:00] tell but that's okay we know that it's
[50:03] all good the Lord will look after us and
[50:06] uh you know I've just been preaching in
[50:08] Calvary I'm I'm just going to be myself
[50:10] today and uh I hope that's okay we've
[50:13] been preaching in Calgary about God's
[50:15] Will and uh you know I I came in right
[50:19] out of the world brother Wayne said that
[50:21] and uh I'll perhaps get into that a
[50:22] little bit later in the in in the
[50:24] service here but
[50:26] I had a pastor brother Ken Boer many of
[50:29] you probably know him um he he would
[50:31] tell me many times when I would have a
[50:33] question I'd go to him and say Pastor
[50:35] I've got this question I've got this
[50:37] this this thing that I just am trying to
[50:39] work through and uh can you help me with
[50:41] it and and i' really like to know what
[50:43] God's will is for this situation and
[50:44] he'd say well God's will is his
[50:47] word and every single time he would say
[50:49] that to me and every single time I would
[50:51] leave him thinking why won't you give me
[50:53] something to go on give me an answer
[50:56] like I thought that's what pastors do
[50:59] they give you the solution to your
[51:03] problems
[51:05] my I had some learning to do but that's
[51:08] what he told me all the time God's will
[51:10] is his word and you know it became a bit
[51:11] of a struggle for me as he was pastor
[51:13] and as I was Deacon and you know we grew
[51:16] in in the word and the word grew in us
[51:19] and it was a wonderful time we never had
[51:21] any problems in terms of relationship
[51:24] but I just always had this little
[51:25] struggle in my my mind in my in my heart
[51:28] about how could God's will be his word
[51:30] it's such a simple answer seemingly but
[51:33] what brother Ken was telling me was what
[51:35] the message taught and I thought that
[51:37] was so good and it goes further than
[51:39] that and I'm going to continue to say
[51:41] this all day I say it every time I
[51:43] preach the message isn't just the words
[51:46] from Jeffersonville Indiana it's not
[51:48] just William Mary and brandham that's
[51:51] the Vindicated Prophet I know I'm
[51:52] preaching to the choir here but that's a
[51:54] Vindicated Prophet that God chose to
[51:56] speak to the this generation through so
[51:58] when we hear those words he's not just
[52:00] talking to a prophet just through a
[52:02] prophet he's speaking to us God speaking
[52:05] to us lip to ear what a privilege that
[52:08] is to understand that his will in a
[52:11] situation is actually his word so it
[52:13] behooves us to dig in and start eating
[52:15] the book we've got to eat that word if
[52:18] we're not willing to eat that word we're
[52:20] never going to know what God's will is
[52:21] and we're always going to be looking to
[52:23] the pastor brother Wayne give me a
[52:24] solution for my problem
[52:27] and it's never going to work if a man
[52:29] can give you this solution a man can
[52:31] give you a problem he's going to take it
[52:32] away from you but when God comes on the
[52:35] scene it changes
[52:37] everything so I struggled with this for
[52:39] a little while in my life and uh you
[52:41] know if you've ever had God speak to you
[52:44] I'm sure everyone here has if you
[52:46] haven't you will understand it one day
[52:49] uh when God speaks to you you know for
[52:51] sure that's God there's no mistaking it
[52:53] when he speaks to you and and really I
[52:56] think think we all all ought to come to
[52:58] the place where he speaks to us we speak
[53:01] to him but we just need to quiet
[53:02] ourselves enough to allow him to speak
[53:04] to us but one day I was driving to work
[53:07] and I was going through a little bit of
[53:08] a a time in my life and uh it was just
[53:11] interesting it's the way God does stuff
[53:14] he catches you off guard when you don't
[53:16] expect it that's when he's coming on the
[53:18] scene he specializes in that but I was
[53:21] driving and uh just heard this voice and
[53:24] I thought someone was jumped in my van
[53:26] it was the strangest thing but what I
[53:28] heard was so you want an answer for that
[53:31] question and and I thought you know what
[53:33] question just it was in the morning
[53:35] didn't have much coffee I love coffee I
[53:37] didn't have much coffee and I was just
[53:39] thinking what question you know just
[53:40] kind of driving along and uh that
[53:43] question about God's will being his word
[53:46] and and so I said yeah I do I I would
[53:49] love an answer for that and he said okay
[53:52] take a look at Joseph take a look at
[53:54] Joseph's life look into the story of
[53:56] Joseph's life and I thought wow his will
[54:00] is his word okay how does that apply
[54:02] though so I actually did go and look it
[54:05] up and uh it really is good to follow
[54:07] the leadership of the Lord when he
[54:08] speaks to you so I went and looked it up
[54:10] and looked at the story of Joseph and
[54:12] you know he had some real hard
[54:14] circumstances he encountered a lot of
[54:16] problems that he did not cause but yet
[54:20] one thing didn't change in his life and
[54:23] that was his love for the Lord he just
[54:26] was who he was he did not try to pretend
[54:29] to be anyone he was a dreamer God made
[54:32] him a dreamer from his mama's womb and
[54:35] when he had those dreams he just spoke
[54:37] those dreams and and while his brothers
[54:40] hated him he told them more
[54:42] dreams and his brothers hated him more
[54:45] but we know that his daddy took notice
[54:47] to it and then his daddy made him the
[54:49] coat of many colors and then his
[54:50] brothers just couldn't handle him
[54:51] anymore that was it they had to do away
[54:53] with this guy but this guy he had
[54:55] something in his life and that one thing
[54:57] was he had God's will in his life was
[55:00] what I took out of this this leadership
[55:02] of the Lord he you know he spoke to me
[55:04] directly about this so uh I don't know
[55:06] if we have any questions I thought my
[55:09] goodness how on Earth could it be that
[55:13] simple but what it led me to believe led
[55:16] me to understand probably rather is that
[55:19] it doesn't matter where we are and it
[55:22] doesn't matter what we're doing and it
[55:24] doesn't matter what we're going through
[55:26] he'll let us get right into the fire
[55:29] because he wants to be the fourth man in
[55:31] that fire he doesn't want to just leave
[55:33] us in that fire he doesn't want to just
[55:36] leave us in the pit he doesn't want to
[55:37] just leave us as a slave down in Egypt
[55:39] he wants to take us and bring us right
[55:42] to the right hand of
[55:44] God I I was like Wow could that be and
[55:50] he said yep it could but I know you want
[55:53] another
[55:54] one cuz I know it's out of the mouth of
[55:57] two or three Witnesses let every word be
[55:58] established so he said you want another
[56:00] one you don't want just one so I'm going
[56:01] to give you another one and I'm like yes
[56:02] amen bring it and he said take a look at
[56:04] Daniel's life look at Daniel the Prophet
[56:08] again someone who just was he didn't do
[56:11] nothing wrong the only thing he did was
[56:13] just existed but he wound up serving God
[56:16] he winds up getting carried down
[56:18] captivity into Babylon and what happened
[56:20] to him he winds up becoming one of the
[56:23] princes of the governors it was amazing
[56:27] what happened in his life but both of
[56:28] those stories both of those instances
[56:31] what happened was they just kept the
[56:32] Lord first so it let me to believe that
[56:35] you know what I don't need to seek God's
[56:36] will necessarily even though don't don't
[56:39] please do not take me wrong with this we
[56:42] want to seek the Lord's will we want to
[56:45] say Lord I've got this thing and I put
[56:47] it before
[56:48] you and what do you think about it but
[56:52] many times I think we can be so worried
[56:54] I know I was this is what happened to me
[56:55] I was so worried about making a move in
[56:57] my life that I would be outside of God's
[56:59] will or he'd strike me with
[57:01] lightning that's not what he wants for
[57:03] his children that's not what he wants
[57:04] for his
[57:05] bride where I'm going to is typical for
[57:08] me the punchline today brothers and
[57:10] sisters is the word is in the bride and
[57:12] she has thus sayith the
[57:14] Lord and the mind of Christ to know what
[57:17] to do with that
[57:19] wordu we're going to get into that in a
[57:21] little bit that's good we don't have to
[57:24] be frightened about taking a step
[57:25] forward words in fact when I tell people
[57:29] back home don't sit on the couch and
[57:31] wait for God to bless you with the
[57:33] job brother bradam says be up and doing
[57:37] get going go and take that job that
[57:40] you're way overqualified for and see if
[57:43] God won't bless
[57:45] it he could take you in that
[57:47] circumstance and give you the ability to
[57:49] meet someone who owns a business that
[57:51] will blow your mind he's just looking
[57:52] for someone just like you that Joseph or
[57:55] that Daniel to come and work in his
[57:58] business but if you don't get up and get
[58:00] off the couch and go to work I don't
[58:02] even know why I'm doing this this is
[58:03] where it is if you don't do that how
[58:06] could you get that
[58:07] blessing and even more than that how can
[58:10] you not how could you be that blessing
[58:13] to that brother that man that's looking
[58:15] for
[58:16] you so for myself I I realized wow I I
[58:20] don't need to be so worried I don't need
[58:23] to be so afraid I can start marching
[58:25] forward and no knowing that I'm in God's
[58:27] will because I have his word that I
[58:30] believe the message of the hour I
[58:32] believe what God Said to this generation
[58:35] through the Vindicated Prophet so I
[58:37] don't need to worry I'm not going to
[58:39] live Reckless like I said we don't want
[58:42] to do that but if you've got his word
[58:46] you got his
[58:48] will now I know there's some folks that
[58:50] would take the other part of that quote
[58:51] and say you know what if they don't have
[58:53] thus sayith the Lord then they sit still
[58:55] and obviously
[58:57] right but when you recognize who you are
[58:59] and where you stand brothers and sisters
[59:02] we're going to get into this here my
[59:05] it's just wonderful it brother talking
[59:08] about our scripture today you know verse
[59:10] 23 out of out of what we just read in
[59:12] first Thessalonians chapter 5 and the
[59:13] Very God of Peace sanctify you not
[59:17] partially holy and the point I want to
[59:20] get to is he's done it right this is his
[59:23] work he has Sanctified you holy
[59:27] entirely Satan's going to come around
[59:29] and say well what' you do
[59:31] yesterday you remember what you thought
[59:33] remember what you saw remember what you
[59:35] said remember remember remember stop
[59:37] remembering and start
[59:39] reading and then eventually you'll start
[59:41] speaking and as you speak Satan ain't
[59:44] going to want nothing to do with you
[59:46] those thoughts will start to flee remind
[59:48] him say this to Satan and the Very God
[59:50] of Peace will sanctify me holy and I
[59:54] pray that the god
[59:56] your whole spirit and soul and body PR
[59:59] preserve blameless until the coming of
[1:00:01] our Lord Jesus
[1:00:03] Christ preserved
[1:00:06] blameless today I want to talk about uh
[1:00:09] our moments of decision our moments of
[1:00:13] decision you know David uh Daniel sorry
[1:00:16] and uh Joseph they all had moments of
[1:00:19] decision and I think if anyone really
[1:00:22] had the opportunity or occasion to
[1:00:24] really start to get upset and start to
[1:00:27] really maybe kick the dirt and say God
[1:00:29] why aren't you hear in my prayers why am
[1:00:31] I here why why why they were too that
[1:00:34] had that
[1:00:35] opportunity maybe even the right
[1:00:37] carnally
[1:00:39] speaking but I just can't help but think
[1:00:41] that they they maybe looked at this
[1:00:42] scripture and and saw that he is the one
[1:00:46] that's doing this verse 24 says Faithful
[1:00:49] Is He that calleth
[1:00:51] you and he doesn't say that you will
[1:00:54] also do it
[1:00:56] he will also do
[1:00:58] it it's up to him brothers and sisters
[1:01:02] and I think if we're willing to look at
[1:01:03] it that way if we're willing to give it
[1:01:05] to him to make it up to him it will
[1:01:08] change everything for Us Faithful Is He
[1:01:12] that calleth you if you've been able to
[1:01:14] hear the call in this age brothers and
[1:01:17] sisters it's because he's faithful to
[1:01:19] his
[1:01:20] seed he's not going to let one of his
[1:01:22] seeds go not one of his seeds is going
[1:01:24] to rot in the ground not one of his
[1:01:26] seeds is just going to get plucked up by
[1:01:27] a bird or or cast by the wayside none of
[1:01:30] them are going to be lost every single
[1:01:33] seed is going to raise
[1:01:35] up I just looked at this word holy out
[1:01:38] of verse 23 here in 1 Thessalonians
[1:01:41] chapter 5 holy is G
[1:01:44] 3651 and it's it's complete to the end
[1:01:48] it might sound obvious but the last part
[1:01:50] of that I think is just just wonderful
[1:01:52] it's absolutely perfect is what it says
[1:01:54] that Strong's Concordance
[1:01:56] absolutely perfect so he's going to take
[1:01:59] you who are absolutely perfect complete
[1:02:02] to the end and I pray that God your
[1:02:05] whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:02:06] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[1:02:08] our Lord Jesus Christ if we have his
[1:02:11] word brothers and sisters you have his
[1:02:13] will and I think the the the the the
[1:02:17] gist of really where I want to get into
[1:02:19] today is to understand that we don't
[1:02:20] need to be afraid we can March forwards
[1:02:23] with confidence knowing that all Heaven
[1:02:25] is going to back us up because this
[1:02:27] isn't our word we're trying to put out
[1:02:29] there we're not coming up with our own
[1:02:31] Revelation you know if we've got a
[1:02:33] revelation from God it's actually going
[1:02:35] to line up exactly with the word of God
[1:02:38] and if it's not lining up with the word
[1:02:40] of God we've been taught to just let it
[1:02:42] go cuz we don't have a thought coming
[1:02:44] but the devil loves to bring Revelations
[1:02:46] too brothers and sisters but we've been
[1:02:48] given an opportunity we've been given a
[1:02:50] benchmark to know whether it is God or
[1:02:53] whether it's the devil
[1:02:56] but if we got a revelation that lines up
[1:02:57] with the word we got every single reason
[1:02:59] to scream and shout when we get to
[1:03:01] church because we know that's God
[1:03:03] dealing with
[1:03:05] us it doesn't get any better than that
[1:03:07] not in the age in which we live in we
[1:03:08] know this whole world's falling apart
[1:03:10] around us it sure is in Canada I'm I
[1:03:14] don't think it's a whole lot different
[1:03:15] here
[1:03:16] really you know we had uh talked about
[1:03:19] this is one of the first things that I
[1:03:20] really got into with brother Wayne and
[1:03:23] brother Ken you know brother brother
[1:03:24] brandham and invisible the bride he says
[1:03:27] in one part just near the end of the
[1:03:29] message he says it says though you never
[1:03:32] did it in the first place and what a
[1:03:34] beautiful statement that is isn't it sir
[1:03:37] but you know we hear it said many times
[1:03:40] read the whole quote because if you just
[1:03:42] go down a few more paragraphs he says
[1:03:44] you never did it you never did it in the
[1:03:47] first place it was the devil that came
[1:03:50] around and Eve did it and Adam followed
[1:03:53] his bride because he would not ow his
[1:03:56] bride to go into destruction he needed
[1:03:58] his bride we know that but it's not as
[1:04:01] though you never did it brothers and
[1:04:02] sisters you never did it and that's not
[1:04:05] just what the prophet from
[1:04:06] Jeffersonville Indiana the Backwoods
[1:04:08] Kentucky hillbilly Prophet said I
[1:04:10] apologize if anybody gets upset by that
[1:04:12] it's just the way I speak but you know
[1:04:14] what he was just a
[1:04:16] man he was the man that God chose to
[1:04:19] speak to this generation
[1:04:22] through and the moment of our decision
[1:04:24] this is really where where the rubber is
[1:04:26] going to meet the road now our moment of
[1:04:28] decision is to decide was it a man or
[1:04:30] was it God who is speaking to us through
[1:04:33] that
[1:04:34] prophet and you know when we get into
[1:04:36] this book here this exposition of the
[1:04:39] seven Church ages where I'm going to get
[1:04:40] into is pick up your pen and right it's
[1:04:42] where we've been at church and and we've
[1:04:44] been studying the exposition of the
[1:04:45] seven Church ages but it goes from
[1:04:47] talking in in regular words and and you
[1:04:50] know the scriptures are actually
[1:04:52] italicized but he gets into this pick up
[1:04:54] your pen and write and if you haven't
[1:04:55] notice this all of the words in that
[1:04:58] quote are italicized and what that is is
[1:05:01] it's it's underlining it's highlighting
[1:05:03] it's expressing something to the people
[1:05:06] it's showing that it's not brother
[1:05:07] brandham speaking someone else is
[1:05:09] actually inspiring this note and this
[1:05:12] note isn't about
[1:05:15] him it's about the church it's about his
[1:05:19] bride it's so
[1:05:21] beautiful but how could we ever get this
[1:05:24] outside of a Vindicated prophet
[1:05:26] right what a tremendous blessing it is
[1:05:28] if you have the ability to hear his word
[1:05:31] if you have the ability to hear that God
[1:05:33] sent a prophet you got every single
[1:05:36] reason to Rejoice brothers and sisters
[1:05:37] my goodness every single reason to
[1:05:41] Rejoice you know as we started out I I
[1:05:44] said you know this is uh just a
[1:05:45] wonderful thing to get together and
[1:05:48] worship there's coming a day where
[1:05:50] that's all we're going to
[1:05:51] have and I just can't help but think you
[1:05:54] know every time we get together like
[1:05:55] this and we have a worship service maybe
[1:05:57] we have a sing song maybe there's
[1:05:59] specials brothers and sisters these are
[1:06:01] all opportunities to
[1:06:03] practice they're practices for the
[1:06:06] greatest special of our life we're going
[1:06:09] to stand before the king of kings and
[1:06:11] all Heaven is going to be quiet to
[1:06:13] listen to you
[1:06:15] worship think about how holy Heaven is
[1:06:18] how many angels how those beings were
[1:06:20] created that never will ever understand
[1:06:22] what it means to be redeemed so they're
[1:06:24] just going to be quiet and Marvel at
[1:06:26] these ones who were redeemed but my
[1:06:29] goodness I tell the people at home when
[1:06:32] they get I I know the preach into the
[1:06:34] choir here many times we have the uh the
[1:06:37] people in in Calgary sometimes can maybe
[1:06:40] be a little
[1:06:41] starchy maybe not just in Calgary
[1:06:44] sometimes people anywhere can be just a
[1:06:45] little bit starchy but I I want to
[1:06:47] remind you of what God Said through that
[1:06:49] prophet he said that this is the
[1:06:51] quietest place you're ever going to be
[1:06:52] brothers and sisters if coming to church
[1:06:55] gets you up uncomfortable there's
[1:06:57] something wrong we need to get saved
[1:07:00] because when we're redeemed when we're
[1:07:02] saved something comes up from the inside
[1:07:04] of the inside what we have here is an
[1:07:07] opportunity to express that life that
[1:07:09] he's put inside of
[1:07:11] us this is the quietest place it's ever
[1:07:13] going to be it's going to be loud down
[1:07:15] there is what brother brandham said it's
[1:07:17] going to be loud people are going to be
[1:07:18] regretting turning their nose up at the
[1:07:20] message they're going to be regretting
[1:07:22] not coming to worship service they're
[1:07:24] going to be regretting turning their
[1:07:26] back on what their parents taught them
[1:07:28] but my goodness those people who are up
[1:07:29] there they're going to they're going to
[1:07:31] way outshine in terms of volume and decb
[1:07:34] what those people are moaning about
[1:07:36] downstairs when we come together here
[1:07:38] we've got every single opportunity don't
[1:07:40] let nobody brother brandham says it
[1:07:42] don't let nobody get between you and
[1:07:44] that word don't let nothing get between
[1:07:47] you and that
[1:07:50] word and when you have something in your
[1:07:52] life and you can't worship you got
[1:07:54] something between you and that word
[1:07:56] brothers and
[1:07:57] sisters and all it is is a
[1:08:00] devil just a devil he's standing there
[1:08:03] right in the way of your
[1:08:05] blessing and as long as you let him
[1:08:07] stand there he's going to stay there and
[1:08:09] he might even bring friends if you're
[1:08:10] not
[1:08:11] careful kick him out the best way to
[1:08:14] kick him out is to start worship
[1:08:16] [Applause]
[1:08:20] him but you know what brother bradam
[1:08:22] said there at the end of The Invisible
[1:08:24] Union of the Bride it it's just in line
[1:08:26] with the scripture exactly in line with
[1:08:27] the scripture but I'm sure people many
[1:08:29] times even now I I didn't understand it
[1:08:31] for the longest time but if you look at
[1:08:33] it it's exactly the scripture Matthew
[1:08:34] 5:48 be ye therefore perfect even as
[1:08:37] your father which is in heaven is
[1:08:39] perfect many times people must have just
[1:08:42] been shocked to hear that how could you
[1:08:43] ever be perfect how could I ever be
[1:08:45] perfect I thought that for a long time
[1:08:47] how could I ever be perfect well you
[1:08:49] ain't looking at this
[1:08:50] flesh if you're looking at this flesh
[1:08:53] you're missing what he's talking about
[1:08:54] entirely
[1:08:56] he's looking at that theophany body that
[1:08:58] he made for you before the foundation of
[1:08:59] the world the way that he created you so
[1:09:02] stop looking at your flesh and start
[1:09:04] looking at the
[1:09:05] word if you can do that then you too can
[1:09:08] be therefore perfect and you can say hey
[1:09:13] I never did it in the first
[1:09:15] place what a blessing that is I'm going
[1:09:18] to read a little bit out of the
[1:09:19] exposition of the seven Church
[1:09:21] ages if that's
[1:09:24] okay I of the the newer book it's
[1:09:26] paragraph 55 brother Bram you know in
[1:09:29] line with what we're talking about here
[1:09:30] you remember I I I titled it the moment
[1:09:33] of our decision because we've always got
[1:09:36] a decision every single day we live
[1:09:38] we're making decisions we're always
[1:09:40] calculating recalculating making
[1:09:42] decisions decisions decisions let one
[1:09:44] decision never change never let nothing
[1:09:47] get between you and that word brother
[1:09:49] random he says now we ask what is the
[1:09:51] will of God there's only one way to know
[1:09:56] his will and that's by the word of
[1:09:59] God that's by the word of God he goes on
[1:10:03] to say there it is if it isn't in the
[1:10:06] word you can't have
[1:10:07] it and that's why I think it's so
[1:10:09] beautiful you don't have to be afraid if
[1:10:11] you want to know whether you got God's
[1:10:13] will start
[1:10:14] marching if you're marching the wrong
[1:10:16] way God's going to let you know real
[1:10:18] quick you're going the wrong way right
[1:10:22] something will happen doors will close
[1:10:25] doors will open too
[1:10:27] though says we can't ask it unless it's
[1:10:30] in his word and we can't petition our
[1:10:32] ask unless it's in his name there it is
[1:10:35] again Jesus the name is the word will
[1:10:40] you can't separate God from the word
[1:10:43] they are one and you know that's the
[1:10:46] biggest trick of the devil these days is
[1:10:47] to get into the trinitarian ism and
[1:10:50] let's Chop God into three pieces and
[1:10:52] then we can dissect and analyze you're
[1:10:54] never going to know God through
[1:10:57] intellect you're going to get to know
[1:10:58] the devil but you're never going to get
[1:11:00] to know God through intellect he'll let
[1:11:02] you go and March around in the
[1:11:03] wilderness around and around and around
[1:11:06] but you you can't separate God and the
[1:11:09] word and that's where I think this gets
[1:11:11] real good he goes on to say now then
[1:11:13] this word has left behind on the printed
[1:11:16] page is part of him when you accept it
[1:11:19] by faith into a Spirit-filled
[1:11:22] life he said that his word was life John
[1:11:27] 663b but that is exactly what he is I am
[1:11:31] the way truth and life John 146 If any
[1:11:34] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[1:11:35] none of his Romans
[1:11:38] 889b there it is he is spirit and he is
[1:11:42] life that is exactly what the word is
[1:11:45] that is exactly what Jesus is he is the
[1:11:50] word this is where it gets so rich are
[1:11:53] you able to bring this up
[1:11:58] if not doesn't matter brother don't
[1:12:00] don't sweat it I'm I'm just going to let
[1:12:02] this soak a little bit brother Bram is
[1:12:04] probably very familiar for everyone I I
[1:12:06] hope it is I trust it is if it's not I
[1:12:08] hope it becomes that way brother Bram he
[1:12:10] says these words so when a spirit born
[1:12:14] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[1:12:17] word into his heart just like Mary and
[1:12:21] says Amen to that word when that man
[1:12:24] takes that word in into his heart and
[1:12:26] places it not just in his heart or in
[1:12:28] his pocket or in his glove box in his
[1:12:30] car but places it upon his lips why
[1:12:33] that's the same as deity
[1:12:36] speaking it's not like it's just like
[1:12:39] deity
[1:12:40] speaking he says
[1:12:42] it it's the same as deity speaking and
[1:12:47] every Mountain has to
[1:12:49] go and the last sentence of this
[1:12:52] paragraph is just so beautiful Satan
[1:12:54] can't stand before that
[1:12:57] man he can't stand before that man
[1:13:00] because it's not that man
[1:13:02] speaking it's the spirit inside that man
[1:13:05] that's uttering those words right that's
[1:13:08] right and you know that's why we're here
[1:13:10] brothers and sisters it's not to go to
[1:13:12] church to have good families and to just
[1:13:14] have a wonderful life together we're
[1:13:16] here to actually be the manifestation of
[1:13:19] the Living Word for our day that's our
[1:13:21] purpose here on life so that we can hang
[1:13:23] a weapon on the devil I remember brother
[1:13:25] Wayne preaching this one time could you
[1:13:27] imagine having your wife going and
[1:13:29] hanging a whooping on the bad guy that's
[1:13:32] what God has chose to do in this age to
[1:13:34] take his bride to go and hang a whooping
[1:13:37] on the devil
[1:13:39] that's so don't be afraid don't worry
[1:13:43] you're in his
[1:13:44] will take his word take it all don't
[1:13:48] don't be
[1:13:49] afraid we know that perfect love casts
[1:13:51] out
[1:13:52] fear and that perfect love brothers and
[1:13:55] sisters is literally the life of Jesus
[1:13:56] Christ in us it's not a portion of of
[1:14:00] the lord it's not a portion of the
[1:14:02] spirit it's not a portion of God we can
[1:14:05] get really Technical and try and
[1:14:08] separate everything and analyze it all
[1:14:10] don't do that don't do that just say
[1:14:13] Amen to the word just say it's deity
[1:14:16] speaking brother bradam he goes on to
[1:14:18] say and right today when the church
[1:14:20] returns to the word in faith we can say
[1:14:23] without doubt that the glory of God and
[1:14:25] the wonderful acts of God will be in her
[1:14:29] midst again you know I I don't doubt for
[1:14:32] a second that all of that is here right
[1:14:35] it's all over but the devil wants to try
[1:14:38] and make us feel like it's not maybe it
[1:14:41] was the doctor maybe it wasn't this
[1:14:43] maybe it wasn't that maybe it was
[1:14:45] something else you know what we need to
[1:14:47] do is doubt our doubts doubts are the
[1:14:49] devil if we have doubts that's Satan
[1:14:52] coming around we need to have confidence
[1:14:55] knowing who we are and where we
[1:14:59] stand you know the brother Bram he says
[1:15:01] one night as I was seeking the Lord the
[1:15:03] Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen
[1:15:05] and write the Holy Spirit told me to
[1:15:08] pick up my pen and write as I grasp the
[1:15:09] pen to write his Spirit gave me a
[1:15:12] message for the church and I want to
[1:15:14] bring it to
[1:15:16] you so
[1:15:18] beautiful it has to do with the word and
[1:15:20] the
[1:15:21] bride i i i every single time I read it
[1:15:25] I I speak it it's just wonderful brother
[1:15:28] BR I'm going to just glaze over it we'll
[1:15:31] hit some highlights in here and then
[1:15:32] we'll get into kind of what I had for
[1:15:34] notes but he he talks about the law of
[1:15:38] reproduction and and we're all familiar
[1:15:40] with it I'm sure in Genesis we know that
[1:15:43] God said let every seed bring forth
[1:15:46] after its own
[1:15:49] kind we don't just go out one day and
[1:15:53] say wow I got saved today I became a
[1:15:58] seed of God that's not the way it
[1:16:01] works what happens as we recognize that
[1:16:04] we were a seed of God and that word that
[1:16:07] we heard preached Came Upon that seed
[1:16:10] and it quickened it and it caused it to
[1:16:12] crack open and a life started to grow
[1:16:15] it's no different than the story of Mary
[1:16:18] what happened in Mary's life she had an
[1:16:20] angel
[1:16:22] messenger bring her a message
[1:16:25] and that message said that you know what
[1:16:27] the power of the highest is going to
[1:16:29] overshadow
[1:16:31] you oh thou thou Mary highly favored
[1:16:36] among women I just can't help but think
[1:16:39] about the bride and how highly favored
[1:16:42] she is among women among the church the
[1:16:45] female but to have that word come across
[1:16:48] the seed brothers and sisters something
[1:16:50] happens the the power of the highest
[1:16:53] overshadows that seed and 's a life that
[1:16:56] comes that life is actually what's his
[1:16:59] name Jesus Christ in The Bride of Mary
[1:17:02] and you know what Hebrews 138 he's the
[1:17:05] same yesterday today and forever it's no
[1:17:07] different when we take that word of the
[1:17:10] message that angel messenger when we
[1:17:12] take that word and say Amen be it unto
[1:17:14] me according to Thy word there's a life
[1:17:16] that starts to grow inside of us and
[1:17:18] when that life comes to a mature place
[1:17:22] we can just speak the word we don't have
[1:17:23] to be afraid amen that's right but Bram
[1:17:27] he says
[1:17:29] here they and the bride will be so much
[1:17:32] like him they will even be in his very
[1:17:38] image this is beautiful he talks about
[1:17:41] this in the
[1:17:44] uh oh my spoken word is the Original
[1:17:48] Seed as
[1:17:50] well but they and the bride will be so
[1:17:52] much like him they will be in his very
[1:17:53] image this is an order to be United with
[1:17:56] him it's not just to be like him it's
[1:17:58] not to just go and and be with him it's
[1:18:01] to be United with him they will be one
[1:18:04] they're not going to be two they will be
[1:18:07] the very manifestation of the word of
[1:18:10] the Living God and I think it's just so
[1:18:13] beautiful when we can look out and see
[1:18:16] sitting here today A True Word
[1:18:17] Tabernacle the very manifestation of the
[1:18:21] word of the Living God there's something
[1:18:23] inside of the side that wants to just
[1:18:25] say Amen to the word there's a reason
[1:18:28] why we came out to church and that's the
[1:18:30] fellowship with the
[1:18:31] lord it's so that we can actually be
[1:18:34] honed it's so that we can be fitted we
[1:18:37] can have some of the rough edges chipped
[1:18:39] off of
[1:18:41] us I just love how brother Bram talks
[1:18:44] about this I'm
[1:18:46] I'm there's one more quote I want to
[1:18:48] read in here brother Bram he says in
[1:18:50] here here is the secret of this here is
[1:18:54] the secret of this the word is in the
[1:18:58] bride as it was in Mary the bride said
[1:19:02] amen to the word and when she did that
[1:19:05] something happened in her life and every
[1:19:08] single one who has ever had the new
[1:19:10] birth understands what I'm talking about
[1:19:13] and if you've never had the new birth I
[1:19:15] highly recommend you take a look at it
[1:19:17] there's a reason why you're here today
[1:19:19] and that reason is there's something
[1:19:22] calling you there's something groaning
[1:19:24] on the inside but that word is in the
[1:19:27] bride as it was in Mary the bride has
[1:19:30] the mind of Christ for she knows what he
[1:19:33] wants done with the
[1:19:35] word isn't that beautiful amen you ever
[1:19:38] look at a husband and wife you see a a
[1:19:42] wife that just knows what the husband
[1:19:44] wants she understands her husband right
[1:19:48] and if someone were to say what would
[1:19:49] your husband do in this situation she
[1:19:51] would know right she would be able to
[1:19:53] say whether her husband usband would
[1:19:55] like this or whether her husband
[1:19:57] wouldn't like this would her husband say
[1:19:59] you should go here or you shouldn't go
[1:20:02] here should you watch that or shouldn't
[1:20:04] you watch that should you say that or
[1:20:06] shouldn't you say
[1:20:08] that she knows what her husband wants
[1:20:14] oh it's no different
[1:20:17] today she performs the command of the
[1:20:20] word in his name for she has thus sayeth
[1:20:23] the Lord
[1:20:25] and I I just can't help but think it's
[1:20:26] exactly in line with the word when we
[1:20:28] have his word in our lives when we've
[1:20:30] had that new birth then you have thus
[1:20:34] sayith the Lord you have his
[1:20:36] will we've heard people say it before
[1:20:39] that you know it's like getting control
[1:20:42] of the bank account you got the full
[1:20:43] checkbook he's just given you the full
[1:20:45] checkbook you have all of the resources
[1:20:48] that you'll ever want in your life help
[1:20:50] yourself because I trust you you're my
[1:20:53] bride your word is as good as my word
[1:20:57] that's a lot of trust but here we have
[1:21:00] God speaking about his bride through a
[1:21:02] prophet to this age and there's a bride
[1:21:05] that's rising up saying Amen to that
[1:21:08] word I I I say be it unto me according
[1:21:10] to Thy word I don't understand it I'll
[1:21:12] tell you what honestly brother Barry
[1:21:15] doesn't feel like it but that's got
[1:21:16] nothing to do with it it's what the word
[1:21:18] of God says and the more that I don't
[1:21:21] feel like it the more I want to say his
[1:21:23] word says it I believe it that settles
[1:21:28] it those in the
[1:21:30] bride do only his will no one can make
[1:21:34] them do otherwise I think it's just
[1:21:36] beautiful this part she performs the
[1:21:38] command of the word in his name she has
[1:21:40] thus saith the Lord then the word is
[1:21:42] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:21:46] pass like a seed that's planted and
[1:21:48] watered it comes to full Harvest serving
[1:21:51] its purpose brothers and sisters I I
[1:21:54] just so encouraged by this part here we
[1:21:56] don't have to worry at all amen trust
[1:22:01] the Lord with all your heart and don't
[1:22:04] lean onto your own understanding it's
[1:22:06] when you start to do that you start to
[1:22:08] get intellectual with this word for our
[1:22:10] day that's when you have problems but
[1:22:13] lean not unto your own understanding and
[1:22:15] in all your ways acknowledge Him and
[1:22:19] what will he do he's going to direct
[1:22:20] your path he's going to show you what
[1:22:21] needs to be done he's going to open
[1:22:23] doors that need to be open he's going to
[1:22:25] close doors that need to be closed he's
[1:22:26] going to pay the bills he's going to
[1:22:28] heal your body and most of all he's
[1:22:30] going to save your
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:34] soul we can have so many good things in
[1:22:36] our lives but we need to have our souls
[1:22:39] saved brother Bram said you know one of
[1:22:41] the sickest things that he's seen is the
[1:22:43] church we all need to have our souls
[1:22:47] healed oh my you know out of the spoken
[1:22:50] word is the Original Seed sort of the
[1:22:52] parallel the comparison brother Brown
[1:22:54] I'm he mentions two scriptures right at
[1:22:56] the beginning of this and and he says in
[1:22:58] the in the exposition of the seven
[1:22:59] Church ages I think it's neat how he he
[1:23:01] just condenses it he says he was told to
[1:23:03] pick up your pen and write he had a
[1:23:05] message he wrote it and and and we just
[1:23:07] read it we just read some of it anyways
[1:23:09] but uh in in the in the uh spoken words
[1:23:13] The Original Seed brother bradam says I
[1:23:14] was given the message told to pick up my
[1:23:16] pen and write I picked up my pen and WR
[1:23:18] but first I'm going to tell you
[1:23:19] something and he talks for about an hour
[1:23:22] or more about what this is actually
[1:23:25] taking place and it's absolutely
[1:23:27] beautiful but in First Peter excuse me 1
[1:23:30] Peter chapter 2 he says wherefore laying
[1:23:32] aside all malice and all guile and all
[1:23:35] hypocrisies I I'll let maybe I'll let
[1:23:38] you turn there I just get excited about
[1:23:39] it the beginning of the spoken word is
[1:23:42] the Original Seed where he says pick up
[1:23:43] your pen and write he says two
[1:23:44] scriptures he mentions these two
[1:23:46] scriptures it's First Peter chapter 2
[1:23:50] verse1 and the second one is Ephesians
[1:23:53] chapter 5
[1:23:55] 1 Peter chapter
[1:23:58] 2 verse one wherefore laying aside all
[1:24:02] malice all guile and hypocrisies and
[1:24:07] envies and all evil
[1:24:09] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[1:24:13] sincere milk of the word that ye may
[1:24:16] grow
[1:24:17] thereby if so be that ye have tasted
[1:24:20] that the Lord is
[1:24:22] gracious isn't that
[1:24:24] wonderful to whom coming as unto a
[1:24:27] living Stone disallowed indeed of men
[1:24:31] but chosen of God Amen and precious ye
[1:24:35] also as Lively stones are built up a
[1:24:38] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[1:24:41] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:24:45] to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it
[1:24:49] is contained in the scripture behold I
[1:24:51] lay in sign a Chief Cornerstone elect
[1:24:53] precious and he that believeth on him
[1:24:56] shall not be
[1:24:58] confounded we won't be confused there
[1:25:01] won't be people coming around with with
[1:25:03] message theology causing confusion in
[1:25:06] our lives there will be something on the
[1:25:08] inside of the inside that says no no no
[1:25:10] that's something wrong there that's an
[1:25:12] uncertain sound that's a bell that has a
[1:25:14] crack in it it doesn't ring
[1:25:19] true he won't be confounded in Ephesians
[1:25:22] chapter 5 for the husb husband is the
[1:25:25] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[1:25:28] head of the church and he is the savior
[1:25:31] of the body I just can't help but think
[1:25:34] that goes right back to our scripture in
[1:25:35] 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 you know what
[1:25:38] Faithful Is He that calleth you who will
[1:25:40] also do it it's not up to us to do it
[1:25:43] it's up to us to believe it all we've
[1:25:45] got to do is believe it and then say
[1:25:48] husband this is your word you said this
[1:25:52] just need to remind him a of his word
[1:25:56] when we can do that we'll see him come
[1:25:57] on the
[1:25:59] scene you know brothers and sisters the
[1:26:01] first step the very first step I believe
[1:26:04] with all my heart is get the Holy
[1:26:07] Ghost get the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:26:11] because without the holy ghost in your
[1:26:12] life everything that we're saying today
[1:26:14] might sound good but it's going to be
[1:26:16] just out there somewhere we're just
[1:26:17] going to be poking at it and saying that
[1:26:19] sounds really good and I I I don't know
[1:26:22] maybe one day I I'll be able to get
[1:26:23] there but when you get the Holy Ghost in
[1:26:25] your life this scripture becomes a new
[1:26:28] book to you the message becomes a new
[1:26:30] message to you you can begin to see what
[1:26:33] God is starting to do through the
[1:26:35] message of the hour in a person's
[1:26:37] life but some say first justification
[1:26:40] and
[1:26:41] sanctification and I say yes indeed The
[1:26:43] Works of Grace they're all part of it
[1:26:47] but isn't it isn't it interesting in in
[1:26:49] the in the book of Acts we were talking
[1:26:51] about last night wasn't it while Peter
[1:26:54] yet spake these words what happened to
[1:26:56] them the Holy Ghost fell upon them
[1:26:59] brothers and sisters we don't have to go
[1:27:01] and get Justified and Sanctified we
[1:27:03] don't have to wait till we're perfect to
[1:27:05] start coming to church if we do that
[1:27:06] we're never
[1:27:08] coming think about the thief on the
[1:27:11] cross what church did he go
[1:27:13] to how many times was he
[1:27:16] baptized what message did he believe the
[1:27:19] only thing he can say is I met him
[1:27:22] personally because he introduced himself
[1:27:25] to
[1:27:26] me he said amen to it just remember me
[1:27:29] when you come into your
[1:27:33] kingdom there are works of Grace but you
[1:27:37] know what we've got to come and get
[1:27:38] washed we got to get Washed by the Water
[1:27:41] of the word and when the water of the
[1:27:43] word washes us something happens to
[1:27:47] us I just
[1:27:49] can't man this gets me excited this
[1:27:52] message and maybe not as excited as some
[1:27:55] get but we'll see what the Lord will do
[1:27:57] yet the day is still
[1:28:02] young it's it's a wonderful thing to see
[1:28:05] the the word and to see it happen in
[1:28:09] real
[1:28:10] time and you know many times we can get
[1:28:13] people to church brother bradam says I'm
[1:28:15] afraid that we're just getting people to
[1:28:19] church we can get to church brothers and
[1:28:22] sisters and learn how to dress and learn
[1:28:24] how to talk and learn how to
[1:28:28] walk but that ain't it if that's all it
[1:28:32] is we're a
[1:28:34] denomination we've got to go all the way
[1:28:36] into
[1:28:39] Christ but you know there's been Decades
[1:28:41] of dogs dogmas and Creeds Creeds and
[1:28:44] dogmas and I just love this quote here
[1:28:46] this is out of
[1:28:48] uh this is out of its the rising of the
[1:28:50] sun it just brought came on to me this
[1:28:53] morning when I was studying this you
[1:28:54] know there's been Decades of Creeds and
[1:28:56] dogmas and and analyzation and and even
[1:28:58] now there's ways of doing things in the
[1:29:01] message of the hour there's no ways of
[1:29:03] doing things in the message of the hour
[1:29:05] follow the word of
[1:29:07] God if we're not willing to follow the
[1:29:09] word of God what we're going to do is
[1:29:12] exactly what they did when they came out
[1:29:13] of denomination when the prophet of God
[1:29:16] was here we're going to build a little
[1:29:17] box and we're going to say this is how
[1:29:19] we do it and unless we do it this way we
[1:29:21] don't got it but you know what that's
[1:29:23] right back into what you come out
[1:29:26] of brother brandom he says it there's
[1:29:28] been churches and churches and brides
[1:29:29] and Brides but there has to come one
[1:29:32] there has to be one one bride sir he
[1:29:35] says
[1:29:36] hallelujah has to come a real
[1:29:39] bride there must come one that's not
[1:29:42] only got the
[1:29:43] mechanics understands what it means to
[1:29:45] come to church understand what it means
[1:29:47] to dress right understand what it means
[1:29:49] to wear proper clothing understands
[1:29:52] Holiness understands all of that but
[1:29:54] there must come one that's not got only
[1:29:57] the mechanics but that Dynamic power of
[1:30:00] the Holy Ghost the Dynamics of it makes
[1:30:03] that church live move in the power of
[1:30:07] his
[1:30:10] resurrection he's not looking for a
[1:30:12] church he's looking for a
[1:30:14] bride he's looking for an individual
[1:30:17] intimate relationship with his bride and
[1:30:21] unless we're willing to actually
[1:30:24] go all the way with him brothers and
[1:30:26] sisters we're going to continually just
[1:30:28] have church we'll just be church
[1:30:30] members potentially even part of a
[1:30:34] denomination brother bramy says until we
[1:30:36] come back to that place until we find
[1:30:38] that place what good does it do to
[1:30:42] polish the hubs that's what good does it
[1:30:45] do to give her a facelift or a simonized
[1:30:49] job that's where you put the shiny stuff
[1:30:51] all over it and it looks really good
[1:30:55] whereas when there's no Dynamics in it
[1:30:57] he says no matter how much the mechanics
[1:30:59] prove to be
[1:31:01] right there's got to be a dynamics that
[1:31:04] make it work and you know what he's
[1:31:06] talking about here is getting the Holy
[1:31:08] Ghost there has to be the power of the
[1:31:10] resurrection of the Living God living
[1:31:13] out through our
[1:31:16] lives I just love how he says it in
[1:31:19] paragraph 110 here he says that's what
[1:31:21] he proved that's what he isn't it
[1:31:23] interesting ing how we get caught up
[1:31:25] trying to prove it that's where we make
[1:31:28] a bunch of mistakes when we start trying
[1:31:30] to prove God we don't got to prove God
[1:31:33] there's nothing that we got to do to
[1:31:35] prove God all we've got to do is say
[1:31:37] amen and believe God and he will come
[1:31:40] along I don't know we were talking about
[1:31:43] it the other day there I I think it was
[1:31:44] brother Danny steeman he did a real good
[1:31:46] example of it it it just someone passed
[1:31:48] me a video months ago and and while he
[1:31:51] was preaching I think it was at a youth
[1:31:52] camp and he called two volunteers out of
[1:31:54] the audience and he said your Works uh I
[1:31:58] can't remember the names now goodness
[1:32:01] sakes and mercy no he said uh works and
[1:32:05] uh signs signs and wonders exactly thank
[1:32:08] you he said your signs your wonders
[1:32:11] follow me and he walked all around and
[1:32:14] he just kept preaching but he just
[1:32:15] walked all the way down and all the way
[1:32:17] around in behind walked around and and
[1:32:19] and they just followed him everywhere he
[1:32:21] went those signs and wonders followed
[1:32:23] him and he couldn't escape him he even
[1:32:24] tried to go a little faster than them
[1:32:26] and they just kept following him they
[1:32:28] follow the Church of the Living God
[1:32:30] brothers and sisters when we start
[1:32:32] trying to make it happen we get in his
[1:32:35] way but if we just let the Dynamics
[1:32:38] happen if we just come according to the
[1:32:40] word if we just come according to his
[1:32:42] will those signs and wonders will follow
[1:32:44] us everywhere we go we can try and
[1:32:46] outrun them all the days of our life and
[1:32:48] we'll never be able to escape
[1:32:51] them he was God himself the Dynamics in
[1:32:55] the word that made the body of Jesus
[1:32:58] Christ the body of Jesus Christ he's
[1:33:02] speaking about the literal body of Jesus
[1:33:03] Christ in the grave but I just couldn't
[1:33:05] help but think the body the current body
[1:33:06] of Jesus Christ in the church that made
[1:33:09] that body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and
[1:33:12] dead in the grave Shake into life and
[1:33:15] rise again and roll away the stone I am
[1:33:18] he that was dead so dead till the son
[1:33:22] said he was dead the the moon said he
[1:33:25] was dead all the stars said he was dead
[1:33:28] all nature said he was dead and now now
[1:33:32] the whole world has to recognize that
[1:33:35] he's alive again now brothers and
[1:33:37] sisters where is he then if he's alive
[1:33:41] again is there a geographical
[1:33:44] location no it's in the
[1:33:47] bride and that's why I just can't help
[1:33:50] but say it the word is in the bride and
[1:33:53] we just read it the word is God in print
[1:33:56] form and you can't separate that people
[1:33:59] have
[1:34:01] tried but you take the dynamic power
[1:34:04] away when you do that he was not only
[1:34:07] the mechanics God's word he was the
[1:34:10] Dynamics to prove
[1:34:12] it and as he being the groom the bride
[1:34:16] has to come forth cuz it's part of
[1:34:20] him oh my and it can only be the
[1:34:22] manifestation
[1:34:24] of the fulfilling of all the Revelation
[1:34:28] all the revelations any others has spoke
[1:34:31] of the Bride it can only
[1:34:34] manifest and this is the part that I
[1:34:36] think is so critical so beautiful but so
[1:34:39] critical for us brothers and sisters if
[1:34:41] it does something different from the
[1:34:43] groom it isn't the
[1:34:46] bride he told us that for a
[1:34:48] reason some might say well you know
[1:34:51] different different times in his
[1:34:53] ministry would say this this was the end
[1:34:54] of his ministry so this was the
[1:34:56] culmination of all of the the
[1:34:58] progressive Revelations that brother
[1:35:00] Bram had and here he says it clearly if
[1:35:03] it does something different from the
[1:35:05] groom what's the groom if it does
[1:35:08] something different from the groom
[1:35:09] brothers and
[1:35:10] sisters it ain't the
[1:35:14] bride but I think it's beautiful he said
[1:35:16] we've got so many Brides brides churches
[1:35:18] churches but there's only one
[1:35:20] identification and that identification
[1:35:22] is going to be right in line with the
[1:35:23] word
[1:35:24] and you know there's times there's times
[1:35:26] brothers and sisters where we can get
[1:35:28] off the word and this is so critical
[1:35:30] also when we get off the word and a
[1:35:32] brother comes and says brother did you
[1:35:34] know this you were you said that and is
[1:35:36] that what you believe and you might even
[1:35:37] say well yeah that's the way I've been
[1:35:39] taught that's the way I I believe but he
[1:35:41] might say well did you know that brother
[1:35:43] brandham said this and that he said that
[1:35:44] because the word said that and did you
[1:35:46] know that that's actually wrong and when
[1:35:49] you have that correction in your life as
[1:35:50] a true son and daughter of God you're
[1:35:53] going to say
[1:35:54] wow forgive
[1:35:56] me I was
[1:35:58] wrong some of the hardest words for a
[1:36:01] human being to utter I was
[1:36:07] wrong but if she's the bride she will
[1:36:09] say
[1:36:10] it it's one of the most important things
[1:36:13] in a
[1:36:14] marriage to be able to say that I'm
[1:36:18] wrong if we're not willing to say we're
[1:36:21] wrong then we probably don't have a very
[1:36:22] good marriage
[1:36:25] he goes on to say because she is flesh
[1:36:27] of his flesh bone of his bone life of
[1:36:30] his life power of his power she's what
[1:36:34] she's
[1:36:36] him isn't it
[1:36:38] interesting now we start getting into
[1:36:40] some of the stuff that's going on in the
[1:36:42] world I preached this at home and I hope
[1:36:45] it's okay but did you ever think it
[1:36:47] weird that this whole world is starting
[1:36:49] to want to change
[1:36:52] genders they don't understand man they
[1:36:54] don't understand the anointing that's on
[1:36:57] this age there is going to be a body
[1:37:02] change we had a prophet declare it that
[1:37:05] she is
[1:37:07] he is it any wonder that people are
[1:37:09] trying to change their
[1:37:12] genders I was talking to brother Wayne I
[1:37:15] don't know I I probably shouldn't say it
[1:37:18] I
[1:37:19] pr I was talking to brother Wayne this
[1:37:22] is real prevalent in Canada and I'm sure
[1:37:24] it's coming this way if it's not here
[1:37:26] already how people and I even noticed it
[1:37:28] this morning on my phone I was like
[1:37:30] goodness got to stop these
[1:37:33] updates you did you know maybe I
[1:37:35] shouldn't even say this you have a place
[1:37:37] in your phone in your contacts where you
[1:37:39] can now update your
[1:37:41] pronouns I didn't even know that but I
[1:37:44] was telling brother Wayne you know it
[1:37:46] just hit me the other day when someone
[1:37:47] asked me what's your pronouns I
[1:37:51] am I am
[1:37:55] you know that person probably won't
[1:37:57] understand it they'll scratch their head
[1:37:58] and say what's that but the devil inside
[1:38:01] of him he'll know he'll know exactly who
[1:38:03] is standing before
[1:38:07] him it's no accident that people are
[1:38:09] looking to change their bodies because
[1:38:12] of the anointing on this age Prophet
[1:38:13] spoke
[1:38:14] it and he just quoted the word but she
[1:38:17] is
[1:38:19] him I just can't help but think it's
[1:38:21] beautiful brothers and sisters many
[1:38:22] times we can get caught up in in
[1:38:24] formalism and trying to get everything
[1:38:26] to be just right and you know we have to
[1:38:28] do it this way and that way and you know
[1:38:30] we can wind up with a whole bunch of
[1:38:32] tradition in our life and and absolutely
[1:38:34] ground out that Dynamic power of the
[1:38:36] Holy Ghost in our life and and if you
[1:38:38] don't know what I mean sometimes if
[1:38:40] you've ever seen a lightning rod on top
[1:38:42] of a house there's a wire that comes
[1:38:44] down from that rod and it goes around
[1:38:46] the house and it goes down beside the
[1:38:48] house to a plate that's buried
[1:38:50] underground and what happens is if that
[1:38:52] house ever gets struck by by lightning
[1:38:54] that electricity that Dynamic power will
[1:38:56] just go right around that house and that
[1:38:59] house will never catch fire it'll be
[1:39:02] nice and safe as Believers we don't want
[1:39:04] to live in a safe position brothers and
[1:39:06] sisters we want to be a house set on
[1:39:08] fire don't we we want to see that
[1:39:11] Dynamic power in our
[1:39:13] lives I just can't help but think it's
[1:39:15] so beautiful you know what it was while
[1:39:17] Peter yet spake these words the Holy
[1:39:20] Ghost fell upon them and you know that's
[1:39:22] entirely possible because he's the same
[1:39:24] yesterday today and forever there's no
[1:39:26] formal works that we've got to do if we
[1:39:29] want the Holy Ghost in our life say be
[1:39:31] it unto me according to Thy word Lord
[1:39:34] Jesus just be it unto me according to
[1:39:36] Thy word and what will happen is you'll
[1:39:38] get the Holy Ghost but you got to be
[1:39:40] honest about it and then what will
[1:39:43] happen is he'll come to town he'll come
[1:39:45] to your place and he'll clean you
[1:39:48] up something will say to you
[1:39:51] wow I need to get in line with the word
[1:39:54] of God because in the book of Acts it
[1:39:56] says that you need to be baptized in the
[1:39:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:40:00] remission of your sins and I haven't
[1:40:02] done that yet I I'll tell you a little
[1:40:04] bit of my testimony I was baptized in
[1:40:07] titles I was baptized in the name of the
[1:40:09] Father the Son the Holy Ghost and it was
[1:40:12] interesting I was 14 13 14 somewhere in
[1:40:15] there but I I didn't feel any change I
[1:40:18] was instructed to to get the Holy Ghost
[1:40:20] you got to you got to pray and you got
[1:40:22] to pray and you got to pray and as you
[1:40:24] pray and you pray you'll work it up and
[1:40:25] eventually you'll be you'll be speaking
[1:40:27] in tongues and you know you got it then
[1:40:31] so I tried a little bit as a young
[1:40:33] fellow I was like man this is weird it's
[1:40:36] just weird I can't do that I don't want
[1:40:39] to do that I want the dynamic power of
[1:40:43] the holy ghost in my
[1:40:45] life but I wound up going away and many
[1:40:49] years later many years later I was able
[1:40:53] to to get I believe the baptism of the
[1:40:54] holy ghost in a Wednesday night e
[1:40:58] evening
[1:40:59] service just in church and you know what
[1:41:02] happened was that was different than any
[1:41:04] other time in my life was I said God in
[1:41:07] my heart in my prayer I didn't care who
[1:41:11] was there I wanted the Lord I wanted God
[1:41:14] I wanted to see if God was real and I
[1:41:16] said God if you're God then be real be
[1:41:18] God to me be my God and I'll serve you
[1:41:24] but show me show me that you're God and
[1:41:27] I wasn't looking for him here's a
[1:41:29] stipulation if you meet these
[1:41:31] requirements then I'll come it was none
[1:41:34] of that it was just me being honest if
[1:41:36] you're God then you can be God to
[1:41:39] me just be God to
[1:41:42] me and what did he
[1:41:44] do I was an
[1:41:47] alcoholic I was smoking full-time I I
[1:41:50] wasn't in a good spot in my life I was
[1:41:52] in a real bad bad spot but I was telling
[1:41:54] Brother Ray yesterday it took me about 5
[1:41:56] years to really fully grasp the impact
[1:41:59] the magnitude of that testimony but you
[1:42:02] know I I went to the front of the church
[1:42:03] after service I while I was there in
[1:42:05] church I didn't know about a prophet a
[1:42:07] prophet the message Eagles Mysteries
[1:42:11] seals all these things I was like that's
[1:42:13] way over my I don't know nothing about
[1:42:15] that but there's something inside of me
[1:42:17] that says that ain't nothing but the
[1:42:19] truth I can't explain it and I don't
[1:42:22] understand it
[1:42:23] so I went to the front to the pastor of
[1:42:26] the church and I said to him will you
[1:42:28] pray with me because I just I don't
[1:42:30] understand what's going on man this is
[1:42:33] beyond me will you just pray with me and
[1:42:35] so he said sure and everyone else had
[1:42:37] left they had gone out of the sanctuary
[1:42:39] so we went and it probably would have
[1:42:40] been a location like this here and and I
[1:42:42] knelt down in my
[1:42:45] shorts with the pastor and we
[1:42:48] prayed and I've heard it said before
[1:42:50] that you know there's sometimes people
[1:42:52] aren't even allowed into the church if
[1:42:53] they're not dressed properly how can
[1:42:55] they be Washed by the Water of the
[1:42:59] word I think what would have happen if a
[1:43:01] deacon would have told me you can't come
[1:43:03] in here like that I would have said see
[1:43:07] you but God he had
[1:43:10] plans and I think the True Believer is
[1:43:13] not soon shaken She's Not Afraid she
[1:43:16] wants to see Sinners get saved you know
[1:43:19] brother bradam says when we lose our
[1:43:21] burden for Souls it's time to that we
[1:43:23] get back to the
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:27] altar but while Peter yet spake these
[1:43:29] words the Holy Ghost fell on them don't
[1:43:32] doubt for a second brothers and sisters
[1:43:33] the Holy Ghost can't fall on you my
[1:43:35] point with all of that story is I
[1:43:37] believe with all my heart the Holy Ghost
[1:43:39] fell upon me in that meeting because I
[1:43:42] was genuine I was honest with God I was
[1:43:45] honest with my heart I said be it unto
[1:43:47] me according to Thy word I can't explain
[1:43:49] it how could Mary explain it how could
[1:43:52] she explain what it meant to be a virgin
[1:43:55] and how she's going to conceive Jesus
[1:43:58] Christ how can a Believer
[1:44:01] today explain
[1:44:03] that we can't we just have to say Amen
[1:44:06] to that
[1:44:07] word but you know what happened was it
[1:44:10] wasn't very long afterwards that I
[1:44:11] recognized whoa even though I was
[1:44:13] baptized in titles I wasn't baptized
[1:44:15] according to acts
[1:44:17] 238 I wasn't baptized according to the
[1:44:19] word of God so I needed to come and get
[1:44:21] in line with that word
[1:44:23] and you know when I recognized it when
[1:44:25] that Revelation from God came down into
[1:44:27] my heart because it didn't come from
[1:44:28] another human being it came from God I
[1:44:32] honestly I heard someone talking about
[1:44:34] being baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:44:36] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:44:37] sins but what happened in my life in my
[1:44:39] heart was I shifted from thinking I've
[1:44:42] been baptized what's wrong with my
[1:44:44] baptism to wow if there's something more
[1:44:47] than I want it I want to be so in line
[1:44:49] with that word I want to be one with
[1:44:52] that word
[1:44:55] and when that happened brothers and
[1:44:57] sisters there was no going
[1:44:59] back no going back no cigarettes no
[1:45:02] alcohol there was no struggle with it
[1:45:04] you know what the world teaches is that
[1:45:06] there's a 12-step program brothers and
[1:45:08] sisters I'm here to tell you there's a
[1:45:11] one-step program you get in line with
[1:45:14] this word of God and he'll take away
[1:45:16] smoking he'll take away drinking he'll
[1:45:19] take away drugs he'll take away
[1:45:21] pornography he'll take away being
[1:45:24] unfaithful he will lead you to
[1:45:29] himself because Faithful Is He that
[1:45:32] calleth you who will also do
[1:45:36] [Applause]
[1:45:37] it but when we start saying oh no I've
[1:45:40] got to go and do this and I've got to go
[1:45:42] and do that and and and try the other
[1:45:44] you know what we're to getting in the
[1:45:45] way of
[1:45:46] God I would say we're even stepping into
[1:45:49] denominational Waters don't do it just
[1:45:52] give it all to God and see if he won't
[1:45:54] come on the scene see if he's not
[1:45:57] God I guarantee you he's
[1:46:01] God yes sir good PR out of the spoken
[1:46:04] word is the Original Seed brother Bram
[1:46:07] he talks about the pyramid this is right
[1:46:10] after he talks about pick up your pen
[1:46:11] and write but he goes on a bit of a a
[1:46:13] tangent a bit of an explanation there's
[1:46:15] some real real gems some real nuggets in
[1:46:18] here that I trust will be a blessing
[1:46:20] today he says in that pyramid you can
[1:46:23] take a razor but he's talking about the
[1:46:24] Pyramid in Egypt he mentions how Enoch
[1:46:27] was a part of that but he talks about
[1:46:30] how they built that pyramid and you can
[1:46:31] take a razor blade and you can't run it
[1:46:33] between them rocks where the mortar was
[1:46:36] it's so fitly put together and they said
[1:46:40] Solomon's Temple was the same see and
[1:46:43] many times I have read this and listened
[1:46:45] to it and thought you know these things
[1:46:47] it's just there brother bradam just says
[1:46:48] these words he's not just saying these
[1:46:50] words we're not going to stake our
[1:46:52] Salvation on it but I think he says them
[1:46:53] for a purpose there's an inspiration
[1:46:55] behind it we need to recognize it's not
[1:46:57] just about the Pyramid in Egypt it's
[1:46:59] also about Solomon's Temple Solomon's
[1:47:02] Temple this got me thinking about it you
[1:47:03] know that his Temple was built and there
[1:47:05] wasn't one sound
[1:47:08] uttered I know you're going through a
[1:47:09] renovation here are you are you that
[1:47:11] careful here there's not one sound
[1:47:13] uttered there's not going to be one
[1:47:15] sound in the
[1:47:16] sanctuary when we did our church when we
[1:47:19] did our renovation there we had trades
[1:47:20] guys coming and we would turn up while
[1:47:22] they're working there and they'd have
[1:47:24] their radio going in the sanctuary we're
[1:47:26] like guys come on but Solomon's Temple
[1:47:29] and all of his glory we know the temple
[1:47:32] there wasn't one sound made
[1:47:34] there they made those rocks and Polished
[1:47:37] them those stones for that Temple
[1:47:41] elsewhere God puts it together in a very
[1:47:44] specific
[1:47:45] way the point I want to get to is don't
[1:47:48] think now brother Barry's legalistic
[1:47:50] someone makes a noise in the sanctuary
[1:47:52] there could could be someone that hits a
[1:47:53] hammer someone could drop a hammer on
[1:47:55] their toe and go
[1:47:58] ow it's not a holy thing don't get me
[1:48:01] wrong I'm not
[1:48:03] legalistic being legalist isn't going to
[1:48:05] do nothing for
[1:48:07] you but they said that Solomon's Temple
[1:48:09] was the same it was so fitly put
[1:48:11] together but it got me thinking about it
[1:48:13] you know the holy ghost that we're
[1:48:15] talking about Jesus Christ the word of
[1:48:18] God it's all the
[1:48:20] same God almighty
[1:48:23] it's not different P portions different
[1:48:25] we're not no no no no no don't do that
[1:48:28] it's God the Holy Ghost is without
[1:48:33] sensation but it's not without
[1:48:35] emotion and I think a lot of people kind
[1:48:38] of get those quotes mixed up and they'll
[1:48:40] say that well I can't have emotion
[1:48:42] because it's without sensation brother
[1:48:44] bradam says if your religion doesn't
[1:48:45] have emotion then it's dead and you
[1:48:47] better go bury
[1:48:48] [Applause]
[1:48:51] it but boy oh boy boy if the inspiration
[1:48:55] strikes and he tells you to stand up and
[1:48:57] worship I want to say from experience
[1:48:59] I'd recommend it I'd highly recommend it
[1:49:02] even while everyone is sitting down and
[1:49:04] everything is in order I would highly
[1:49:06] recommend jump up and say hallelujah God
[1:49:09] has spoke to my heart you know what I'll
[1:49:11] give you a testimony there was a sister
[1:49:12] that did that in formal Canada on a
[1:49:15] Wednesday another Wednesday night
[1:49:17] service there's some of the best
[1:49:18] Services a Wednesday night service She's
[1:49:20] suffering with breast cancer and God
[1:49:22] said said to her stand up and receive
[1:49:24] your healing in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:26] and she stood up and she was healed she
[1:49:29] started praising God everyone else was
[1:49:31] wondering what's going on who my she
[1:49:35] must be having a bit of a fit and she
[1:49:39] was God healed
[1:49:41] her don't worry about other people don't
[1:49:44] worry about people's
[1:49:47] opinions God is building himself a
[1:49:50] temple
[1:49:53] and that's why we do Renovations on
[1:49:56] buildings that's why we do new church
[1:49:58] buildings some people would say well
[1:50:01] that's that's Le oysan You're Building a
[1:50:03] Church you're putting money into a
[1:50:05] building all of the I'm sorry brother if
[1:50:07] this is too
[1:50:10] far you said
[1:50:13] preach there's still people that need
[1:50:15] the baptism of the Holy
[1:50:18] Ghost where are they going to get it in
[1:50:22] a Baptist
[1:50:24] Church and a Pentecostal
[1:50:26] church or a church of a living God a
[1:50:30] message Church where that word is
[1:50:32] preached the same word that Peter spoke
[1:50:35] while the Holy Ghost fell on those
[1:50:38] [Applause]
[1:50:39] people brother Bram goes on to say God
[1:50:42] is taking the elect out of that
[1:50:44] Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling
[1:50:48] it out and finishing up the word and
[1:50:51] it's got to be so close until the word
[1:50:53] itself will blend with this word amen
[1:50:58] now I just about had a shouting fit in a
[1:51:00] hotel as I was going through this with
[1:51:02] what word this word the word that the
[1:51:05] prophet was bringing to us this word is
[1:51:08] going to blend so close that it will
[1:51:11] become the same you know I was talking
[1:51:13] on Wednesday we didn't get just so
[1:51:16] everybody knows the notes that I've got
[1:51:17] here it won't be the same exactly but
[1:51:19] I'm going to go home and preach this I
[1:51:21] got inspired for this service
[1:51:23] you know God is taking the elect out of
[1:51:25] the Pentecostal church that hybrid
[1:51:27] pulling it out and finishing up the word
[1:51:30] God is doing this brothers and sisters
[1:51:32] it's not us and it's got to be so close
[1:51:35] until the word itself will blend with
[1:51:37] this word there Comes The Headstone
[1:51:40] crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace To The
[1:51:43] Headstone so beautiful God's doing this
[1:51:48] we just need to be in our positions and
[1:51:51] we got to be willing to March
[1:51:54] forwards you know what if there's an
[1:51:55] influx of people you don't want to tell
[1:51:58] people you can't come in sorry we're
[1:51:59] full I don't know if you encountered
[1:52:02] that here with covid but we had that in
[1:52:04] Calgary where we were only limited
[1:52:06] people there was a point in time where
[1:52:08] we were only allowed to have 12 people
[1:52:10] in our
[1:52:11] building so we had to go to group a
[1:52:13] group b Group C and rotate through all
[1:52:16] of that and you know what it did for me
[1:52:18] is it really made me
[1:52:19] appreciate having a song service
[1:52:23] it really made me appreciate being able
[1:52:24] to come to
[1:52:26] church and you know if there's more
[1:52:28] people that want to come wouldn't you
[1:52:29] want to make more space for
[1:52:31] them wouldn't we want to give them a
[1:52:33] place to actually experience what we've
[1:52:35] already experienced what a tremendous
[1:52:38] blessing it is to get saved to truly get
[1:52:42] the Holy Ghost because we know that
[1:52:45] that's the new
[1:52:46] birth outside of that we haven't really
[1:52:49] had the new birth brother brandham says
[1:52:51] that I don't have the quote today but am
[1:52:55] they're one and the same brothers and
[1:52:56] sisters we don't just come and get saved
[1:52:59] and then work for a while and and put
[1:53:01] our shoulder to the wheel in the church
[1:53:03] and then we get the Holy Ghost and and
[1:53:05] then we actually take that step that's
[1:53:07] that's getting into Catholic dogma
[1:53:09] that's getting out of the way of the
[1:53:12] word it's not what I want to preach
[1:53:14] today out of the spoken word is the
[1:53:16] Original Seed brother R goes on to say
[1:53:19] here you are like this see on there
[1:53:23] see how it way down he's talking about
[1:53:26] the pyramid way down here and it keeps
[1:53:28] getting closer and
[1:53:30] closer the
[1:53:32] ministry the ministry after a while here
[1:53:36] come here's Luther justification
[1:53:39] Justified Wesley Sanctified bunch here
[1:53:41] come Pentecostal restoration of the
[1:53:44] gifts now God is taking from there
[1:53:47] honing out a bunch to make a Ministry
[1:53:51] just EX exactly like that word there
[1:53:55] because it's got to fit with the
[1:53:57] word there is the bride take her up I
[1:54:02] know that we've all seen the stature of
[1:54:04] the perfect man pyramid I haven't put it
[1:54:08] together yet I've been saying it for a
[1:54:09] while but I believe we know that we're
[1:54:12] moving
[1:54:13] forwards this word is marching on it's
[1:54:17] not going backwards and it's not staying
[1:54:19] still the law of the universe that God
[1:54:21] put in play is that you're either
[1:54:23] growing or you're dying there's no
[1:54:26] neutral ground and it's no different
[1:54:28] spiritually speaking brothers and
[1:54:29] sisters but many times we see the
[1:54:31] pyramid and we'll see all of the
[1:54:33] different levels the virtues of the
[1:54:35] Statue of the perfect man and then we'll
[1:54:37] see the space and we'll see The
[1:54:39] Headstone above it so we'll have an
[1:54:41] incomplete pyramid with the space and
[1:54:44] then we'll have a headstone above it and
[1:54:45] we'll see Holy Ghost sometimes in some
[1:54:46] of them or sometimes it's just a space I
[1:54:49] I want to say today I personally believe
[1:54:51] based on this word that we're reading
[1:54:53] that we're talking about is that pyramid
[1:54:55] no longer has that space The Headstone
[1:54:57] has come down and it's now one
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:01] pyramid we can keep making it two
[1:55:03] separate pyramids but what's that going
[1:55:05] to do for
[1:55:06] us if the word is in the bride and she
[1:55:09] has the mind of Christ to know what to
[1:55:11] do with that word there ain't no
[1:55:13] separation there now some might say the
[1:55:16] Holy Ghost is the the the mortar but I
[1:55:19] like what brother meno says he says
[1:55:21] there ain't no mortar between the Holy
[1:55:23] Ghost there ain't no mortar between that
[1:55:24] Capstone and that pyramid there ain't no
[1:55:27] mortar it's the Holy Ghost but it
[1:55:30] becomes one doesn't it doesn't that
[1:55:32] pyramid turn into one pyramid now God is
[1:55:35] taking from there honing out a bunch to
[1:55:37] make a Ministry just exactly like that
[1:55:39] word there because it's got to fit with
[1:55:42] the word there's the bride take her up I
[1:55:46] just think take her up Lord amen take
[1:55:49] her up but we know that we've got a few
[1:55:51] more days to
[1:55:54] go a few more weeks and months and
[1:55:57] potentially years who knows how long
[1:55:58] we'll be here we don't know we just want
[1:56:01] to give the Lord the opportunity to move
[1:56:02] in our
[1:56:03] lives how are we for time
[1:56:06] here we're okay
[1:56:10] amen out of the spoken word is the
[1:56:12] Original
[1:56:15] Seed you know many
[1:56:17] times we can look at the word
[1:56:21] virgin I want to look at that for a
[1:56:23] couple minutes she's a virgin to the
[1:56:25] word is what brother bradam says and
[1:56:27] that word can be taken and and and maybe
[1:56:30] conjured up in certain ways that we can
[1:56:32] feel like maybe we're not a virgin to
[1:56:35] the word maybe we're defiled to the word
[1:56:37] but we need to remember what brother
[1:56:38] bradam says is that this bride that he's
[1:56:41] talking about will be a virgin to the
[1:56:43] word that's right not a virgin to the
[1:56:46] way we
[1:56:47] think Mary was a virgin naturally
[1:56:50] speaking but she also was a virgin to
[1:56:53] the word and why was she a virgin to the
[1:56:54] word because she said be it unto me
[1:56:57] according to Thy
[1:56:59] word she didn't try and mix it in and
[1:57:01] say well mommy said and well Daddy said
[1:57:04] and maybe I need to go and do this or
[1:57:06] check with that or or the other she just
[1:57:09] said be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:57:12] and like we read earlier just like it
[1:57:15] was in Mary so is it in the bride
[1:57:19] today she's a virgin to the word bam he
[1:57:22] says now Christ was manifest to destroy
[1:57:26] the works of the devil that's right
[1:57:29] Christ was manifest to destroy the works
[1:57:31] of the devil you believe that amen he
[1:57:35] says now I can't explain all this I'm
[1:57:37] just going to go through it just quickly
[1:57:39] now hit the high places so you won't
[1:57:41] stay too long Christ was manifest to
[1:57:43] destroy the works of the devil is that
[1:57:45] right congregation says amen you all
[1:57:47] believe that that's why what was he
[1:57:50] God's word which destroys the works of
[1:57:53] the
[1:57:54] hybrid the devil we got into this last
[1:57:57] Wednesday talk about the hybrid and you
[1:57:59] know brothers and sisters you can take
[1:58:01] just a simple example I used on
[1:58:02] Wednesday is you can take oil or and
[1:58:05] vinegar and you can take them and mix
[1:58:07] them up and make a salad dressing and
[1:58:08] you can emulsify it mix it up and make
[1:58:10] them look like they're one right and it
[1:58:13] tastes real good it's a wonderful thing
[1:58:14] you can really shake it up and maybe you
[1:58:16] can use a power mixer and you can make
[1:58:19] it one and it's good for a little while
[1:58:21] isn't it but it's hybrid because the two
[1:58:24] will never mix and you know what all you
[1:58:27] got to do to see if it's hybrid brothers
[1:58:29] and sisters is just set it there just
[1:58:31] just leave it give it a bit of
[1:58:34] time let it come to church give it a bit
[1:58:38] of time see what's going to
[1:58:41] happen if it's hybrid it'll
[1:58:44] separate always there's no way that you
[1:58:48] can change that brother bam he says is
[1:58:50] that right he was was done to do that
[1:58:53] Jesus came to destroy the works of the
[1:58:56] devil he was born to be that to destroy
[1:59:02] the works of his devil now one time that
[1:59:07] was good to look back and say yep that's
[1:59:11] what Jesus was for but I love how
[1:59:12] brother Brandon brings it right up to
[1:59:14] the present time and we know this is God
[1:59:15] doing it with brother bradam through
[1:59:18] brother Bram some might say well this
[1:59:20] was before the seals I'm not interested
[1:59:22] in any of that I'm I'm interested in
[1:59:24] saying this is God's Prophet while he
[1:59:26] was yet in his mother's womb that's the
[1:59:27] way it works he's bringing this message
[1:59:30] here now his body where's his body today
[1:59:33] his body is to do the
[1:59:35] same not just to come to church but to
[1:59:38] destroy the works of the devil brothers
[1:59:40] and
[1:59:41] sisters to destroy the works of the
[1:59:44] devil because the body is head and body
[1:59:48] together is that right if Christ as the
[1:59:52] head was the word his body has to be the
[1:59:55] same thing as his head was that's right
[2:00:00] that right a church of the word born of
[2:00:06] the word virgin born from the word not
[2:00:11] denominational now virgin born from the
[2:00:14] word and that's where I was getting at a
[2:00:16] little bit earlier understanding that
[2:00:18] it's not our dos and don'ts it's not our
[2:00:21] right and wrong in our flesh or even in
[2:00:23] our spirit it's in our soul it's saying
[2:00:27] that I got no other room inside my soul
[2:00:30] than for his word only his word can fit
[2:00:34] inside of my soul and that's the only
[2:00:37] thing that I'm going to allow inside of
[2:00:39] my
[2:00:40] soul it's not our bodies it's not our
[2:00:43] our minds even it's not our flesh
[2:00:45] brothers and sisters don't look at our
[2:00:46] flesh the devil wants to get you looking
[2:00:49] at your flesh he wants to get you
[2:00:50] looking at your brother or sister's
[2:00:51] flesh don't do it look at the word take
[2:00:55] the
[2:00:56] word I hope it's okay that I've got
[2:00:59] these quotes here there's just so many
[2:01:00] nuggets it just it just does something
[2:01:02] to me you know brother bradam he goes on
[2:01:04] to say tell me where he ever said
[2:01:07] organize tell me where the head all say
[2:01:11] it's all right for women to cut their
[2:01:13] hair huh mention it it's not there tell
[2:01:16] me where the head ever said these works
[2:01:20] I do but you shall not do
[2:01:24] them tell me that that ain't the way it
[2:01:28] is we're supposed to do the works he
[2:01:32] wants to accomplish something that he
[2:01:34] never did while he was here in his
[2:01:35] Earthly Ministry and we know brother
[2:01:37] brandham says it through this bride but
[2:01:39] the head said this you want to put the
[2:01:42] scripture down I'll give it to you John
[2:01:43] 14:12 The Works that I do shall you also
[2:01:48] that's his body see see now why I have
[2:01:51] been so so zealous of the kind of seed
[2:01:54] that I planted for the body my goodness
[2:01:58] the rain is going to fall pretty soon
[2:02:00] now I mean the real
[2:02:04] rain the former and the latter reain
[2:02:07] brothers and sisters the real rain and
[2:02:09] it's got to have a seed to fall on I
[2:02:12] hope I live to see it do you understand
[2:02:15] now I can't help but imagine there's
[2:02:17] people there that did not understand
[2:02:19] this
[2:02:23] it will be the Living Word as it was at
[2:02:25] the beginning the spoken word of God
[2:02:28] have his power for it is in him in his
[2:02:31] own body working his own
[2:02:34] way he's going to do it his way brothers
[2:02:36] and sisters whether we like it or not
[2:02:39] it's much better if we can just go along
[2:02:41] with his way but his way is his word
[2:02:43] that's his
[2:02:45] will but there's moments of decision in
[2:02:47] our lives that we have to make and we
[2:02:50] have to be willing to say I I'm going to
[2:02:52] decide to follow that word or I'm going
[2:02:55] to decide to filter that
[2:02:57] word I'm going to say well I'll take
[2:02:59] most of what that Prophet said but
[2:03:01] because of this or that or the other I'm
[2:03:03] just going to leave that other part out
[2:03:05] and when you do that what happens we
[2:03:06] talked about it you ground out that
[2:03:08] Dynamic power that wants to come down on
[2:03:10] the
[2:03:11] mechanics you don't want to ground that
[2:03:13] power out you want to take that
[2:03:14] lightning rod off and throw it away you
[2:03:17] want to let that lightning strike that
[2:03:19] house and set it on fire
[2:03:23] you want to see the Lord come and take
[2:03:25] full
[2:03:27] possession brother bradam carrying on he
[2:03:29] says and when you become not your own
[2:03:32] this is where you got to get out of
[2:03:33] control brothers and sisters it just it
[2:03:35] just gets a little bit out of hand when
[2:03:38] you're not become not your own God knows
[2:03:41] knowed and forew by for knowledge who
[2:03:44] would take this gift and who would use
[2:03:46] it in the right
[2:03:48] way those who have it are Vindicated by
[2:03:51] the word of God with the rest of the
[2:03:54] word and spirit say is that clear
[2:03:58] someone have you believe it comes by
[2:04:00] schooling scholarship
[2:04:03] degrees if you go to school so long if
[2:04:06] you become a bishop study or be a pope
[2:04:09] or you become a cardinal or something
[2:04:11] like that that some would have us
[2:04:13] believe that's where it comes from when
[2:04:15] Man by laying on of hands made you
[2:04:18] something to do it brother Bram here
[2:04:21] says there off the word right and we can
[2:04:24] look at the Catholic church and say yeah
[2:04:26] oh yeah amen we can look at all of the
[2:04:28] theological schools and say yep
[2:04:31] Pentecostal church Baptist Church
[2:04:33] Methodist Church Nazarene Church
[2:04:36] Brothers and Sisters what about the
[2:04:38] message Church what about when we see
[2:04:41] the message
[2:04:43] Scholars now I want to say brother
[2:04:45] brandham said they're off the
[2:04:47] word because they're trying to make it
[2:04:50] something that they feel like it should
[2:04:52] be when it is what it
[2:04:54] is it is the word of God it's the
[2:04:57] literal life of Jesus Christ am we know
[2:05:01] John was a type of the Bride that's why
[2:05:02] he was told to take the book and eat it
[2:05:04] up yes sir it's going to be sweet as
[2:05:06] honey in your mouth oh my it's going to
[2:05:08] roll off our tongues so smooth oh we're
[2:05:11] going to love the taste of
[2:05:13] that but when it comes to coming to
[2:05:16] church half an hour early when it comes
[2:05:18] to actually serving the lord the way
[2:05:21] that God God gave us in the age in which
[2:05:23] we live in oh it's going to be bitter in
[2:05:25] our bellies it's not going to feel good
[2:05:28] but I'll tell you what brothers and
[2:05:29] sisters when you take that flesh and you
[2:05:31] say you know what you've got nothing to
[2:05:34] say you got nothing to say I love that
[2:05:37] song that we sang this morning I can't
[2:05:39] remember the words exactly come on soul
[2:05:41] don't get tired on me now get up and
[2:05:44] worship it's all about our soul it's not
[2:05:47] about this flesh this flesh doesn't like
[2:05:50] it none
[2:05:54] am I know brother Bram in this quote
[2:05:57] here this this just gets me really gets
[2:06:00] me I want to say to anyone who would
[2:06:02] hear my voice this morning brother
[2:06:03] bradam he goes on to say now listen
[2:06:05] closely now how different Jesus was in
[2:06:07] his way in his
[2:06:09] days from the denominations of his day
[2:06:12] you they would point back to
[2:06:16] him how I'd like to hold on this a
[2:06:19] while pH
[2:06:22] they would point back over their
[2:06:23] shoulder back down through time and say
[2:06:26] we are Moses
[2:06:28] disciples we know that God appeared to
[2:06:30] Moses in the burning bush we
[2:06:33] know they know they know the history of
[2:06:37] Moses but they did not know the god of
[2:06:42] Moses now as we go through and read this
[2:06:44] I want to continue reading it I want to
[2:06:46] say brothers and sisters we can look
[2:06:48] back and say we know William Mary and
[2:06:51] Brad
[2:06:52] we know where he lived we know where he
[2:06:55] went to school we know where he was
[2:06:57] raised we know all about him but do you
[2:07:01] know the god of William Mary and
[2:07:05] brandham because if you don't know his
[2:07:07] God I want to say get to know his
[2:07:11] [Applause]
[2:07:12] God you can't just live on tradition we
[2:07:16] cannot live on another man's experience
[2:07:19] brother Bram says it in this quote it's
[2:07:20] a painted fire you can't get warm beside
[2:07:23] a painted fire you got to have the
[2:07:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:28] Fire it's got to be Jesus
[2:07:33] Christ they know the history of Moses
[2:07:36] but they did not know the god of Moses
[2:07:39] cuz he stood before them he literally
[2:07:41] stood before them can you imagine that
[2:07:44] in John 6 and said before Moses was
[2:07:47] before Abraham was I am the burning bush
[2:07:52] they know Moses history they even spoke
[2:07:55] about it that Moses talked to him in the
[2:07:57] burning bush they spoke about
[2:07:59] him but they couldn't recognize him when
[2:08:01] he was standing right in front of them
[2:08:05] why you know I talked to the church
[2:08:08] about Ephesians chapter 5 and I think
[2:08:10] it's so beautiful you know wives submit
[2:08:14] yourselves unto your husbands and
[2:08:16] husbands love your
[2:08:19] wives just like Christ loves the church
[2:08:22] we can talk about the rules but what I
[2:08:25] always do is go back to that verse just
[2:08:27] before that it says submitting
[2:08:29] yourselves one to
[2:08:31] another in the fear of God and if we're
[2:08:35] not willing to actually submit ourselves
[2:08:37] one to another in the fear of God then
[2:08:41] the rest of it is going to be legalism
[2:08:43] brothers and sisters we're going to be
[2:08:45] saying as husbands just get in line just
[2:08:48] get in line submit yourself that's what
[2:08:50] the word says
[2:08:52] that ain't the way we want to have a
[2:08:54] marriage we don't want to have a
[2:08:56] marriage that way we don't want our
[2:08:58] wives feeling that way you know when
[2:09:00] we've got that what what what would it
[2:09:03] be like if God started talking to us
[2:09:05] that way huh Jesus we call ourselves the
[2:09:08] bride but Jesus said just get in line or
[2:09:11] you're going to get it it's coming your
[2:09:13] way the word of God says
[2:09:17] submit that ain't no relationship is it
[2:09:21] we got to be willing to submit ourselves
[2:09:23] one to another in the fear of God and
[2:09:25] you know the other scripture that I
[2:09:27] always go to it says humble yourself in
[2:09:30] the sight of the Lord and what will
[2:09:33] happen he'll lift you up he'll raise you
[2:09:36] up and it's not going to be you floating
[2:09:39] he's going to raise you up in Revelation
[2:09:41] he's going to raise that word in your
[2:09:45] life so how how do you humble yourself
[2:09:49] in the sight of the
[2:09:50] Lord maybe it could be in praying maybe
[2:09:53] it could be coming to the altar the
[2:09:54] front of the church that's what I say to
[2:09:55] people it's not coming to the altar when
[2:09:57] we think that that's what it is it's not
[2:09:59] what it is brothers and sisters humble
[2:10:01] yourselves in the sight of the Lord tell
[2:10:03] your brother your sister I'm
[2:10:06] sorry tell your husband your wife I'm
[2:10:09] wrong ask your parents to forgive you
[2:10:12] because of what you've
[2:10:14] done go to your pastor and say you know
[2:10:16] I I said this about you and I was wrong
[2:10:19] you know there was a brother that did
[2:10:21] that with brother bradam and brother
[2:10:23] bradam he said I'm so happy for that
[2:10:26] brother because God's blessed that
[2:10:28] brother
[2:10:29] abundantly why because he questioned my
[2:10:32] Ministry but yet he took the
[2:10:34] courage I'm so proud of that man he took
[2:10:37] the courage to come and apologize to me
[2:10:39] and what brother bradam says he wasn't
[2:10:41] apologizing to me he's apologizing to
[2:10:45] God brothers and sisters don't think
[2:10:47] that's just for the prophet and the
[2:10:48] prophet's
[2:10:49] office he's listening all the time to
[2:10:54] our
[2:10:55] voice but if we want to actually be
[2:10:57] lifted up we need to make sure that
[2:10:59] we're humbling ourselves in the sight of
[2:11:00] the Lord and we got brothers and sisters
[2:11:02] all full of the Holy Ghost where's God's
[2:11:05] sight
[2:11:07] why brother Bram he says so is it today
[2:11:10] they know the god they claim they know
[2:11:12] the word of Christ but they don't know
[2:11:14] the God that was in Christ painted fire
[2:11:17] who could get warm by a painted fire a
[2:11:19] seminary experience they told Moses but
[2:11:22] not his God
[2:11:25] Jesus could and did say I just think
[2:11:29] it's so it's magnificent really when we
[2:11:32] look at this to see the way that brother
[2:11:35] bradam is talking to us the way that the
[2:11:37] the Lord is speaking to us through this
[2:11:38] word recognizing that he's he's trying
[2:11:41] to encourage us about something that we
[2:11:44] would get the background story that we
[2:11:45] would understand what he's really trying
[2:11:47] to get across to us that we don't have
[2:11:50] to live in fear we don't have to
[2:11:52] continually not move forward and wait
[2:11:54] for God to move things to open doors to
[2:11:57] cause situations to happen we need to be
[2:11:59] up and doing and marching forward and
[2:12:01] trying to do things of course including
[2:12:04] him every step of the way because that's
[2:12:06] what believers do but not being afraid
[2:12:08] that we're going to actually make a
[2:12:13] mistake brother bomy says and at 12
[2:12:15] years old he confounded the scribes and
[2:12:16] the Pharisees oh my that spoke of it why
[2:12:19] didn't they say something to him as a
[2:12:21] kid it was God's word they couldn't
[2:12:23] withstand that no wonder the people were
[2:12:26] astonished at his
[2:12:29] Doctrine he says do you ever read that
[2:12:31] Mark 1:22 if you want to put it down the
[2:12:34] people was astonished at his Doctrine
[2:12:36] because he taught like somebody that had
[2:12:40] Authority he knowed what he was talking
[2:12:42] about
[2:12:44] see the church now should have a double
[2:12:47] portion of the spirit for it is true
[2:12:51] true like Elijah's garment that fell
[2:12:52] upon Elisha a double portion the same
[2:12:54] thing come from Jesus Christ now you say
[2:12:58] oh brother Bram you're talking about his
[2:13:01] church that's right that's his body
[2:13:05] brother Bram he talks about how the body
[2:13:08] only moves because the head's attached
[2:13:10] to
[2:13:12] it and he says what would it be like if
[2:13:15] you had a body and a head together but
[2:13:18] the body was actually cast in concrete
[2:13:21] right and you said move your hand you
[2:13:24] would try and move and try and move you
[2:13:25] couldn't move move my legs move my legs
[2:13:27] you couldn't move there would be nothing
[2:13:28] you could do brother bam talks about
[2:13:31] that being exactly what it's like to be
[2:13:34] hybrid the head is calling for the body
[2:13:37] to move but the body puts itself in a
[2:13:41] box and says this is how it is this is
[2:13:43] the way we do it this is the only way
[2:13:45] it's ever going to
[2:13:46] happen and you're stopping the power of
[2:13:49] God he can't move in our lives then
[2:13:54] you know brothers and sisters I I had
[2:13:55] talked a little bit about it earlier I
[2:13:57] I'll maybe just give you a little
[2:13:58] rundown I I I came right out of the
[2:14:00] world my my wife she worked for a
[2:14:03] company that I I worked with I worked
[2:14:05] for a home builder and and uh she worked
[2:14:08] for a kitchen company and and uh we
[2:14:11] built new houses and we had lots of
[2:14:14] service work as any company does and and
[2:14:17] we actually had to uh deal with a
[2:14:20] kitchen company to fix the service work
[2:14:22] and I would phone there and talk to this
[2:14:24] one girl that worked in the office she
[2:14:26] always got it done every single time it
[2:14:28] was you know it's either going to happen
[2:14:30] or you get a phone call to say it's not
[2:14:31] going to happen so you didn't have false
[2:14:33] expectations and the other girl in the
[2:14:35] office was good but not as good not
[2:14:37] nearly as good not nearly nearly nearly
[2:14:40] as
[2:14:41] good this one
[2:14:45] girl but you know
[2:14:48] um she was able to witness to me the the
[2:14:51] people that I worked with they saidou
[2:14:52] better be careful when you talk to her
[2:14:53] on the phone because she'll hang up if
[2:14:55] you
[2:14:57] swear and I thought wow okay she's a
[2:15:00] Christian girl all right that's fine I'm
[2:15:03] good with that and at that time I was
[2:15:05] drinking I was smoking I was hungering
[2:15:07] and thirsting for righteousness I had no
[2:15:09] idea where to go and I was too afraid to
[2:15:10] try anything I was afraid that the
[2:15:13] church would get my phone number or my
[2:15:14] email and want my
[2:15:19] tithes I had a friend who said to me
[2:15:22] after I got saved he said what I said
[2:15:24] yeah man I got saved and I mean I got
[2:15:26] really saved I got Holy Ghost saved and
[2:15:28] he said just give me your
[2:15:29] money forget about it and I was like no
[2:15:33] no no no you don't even understand
[2:15:35] man I'm not even going to hang out with
[2:15:37] you anymore but I had to give the
[2:15:40] testimony you know but at that place in
[2:15:43] my life there was an attraction there
[2:15:46] was an attraction and it wasn't to a
[2:15:47] girl at all there was nothing to do with
[2:15:50] a girl my parents were divorced and I
[2:15:53] had some bad experiences in the world
[2:15:55] and I was done with women there was no
[2:15:59] getting married for me I had no desire
[2:16:01] to get married and I know some people
[2:16:03] they thought well you know he just went
[2:16:04] to church for the girl and many people
[2:16:06] probably still do and that's fine they
[2:16:08] can think that but you know we know the
[2:16:10] truth um there's no way that my wife now
[2:16:13] would ever have had anything to do with
[2:16:15] a boy in the world it just wouldn't
[2:16:17] happen but what her her resounding
[2:16:20] thought was her resounding just couldn't
[2:16:23] shake it she couldn't get rid of it was
[2:16:24] you got to get that guy to church you
[2:16:27] got to get that guy to church and and so
[2:16:30] she started to invite me to church and I
[2:16:31] started to resist I was like man I don't
[2:16:33] want to go to church now I I'm not ready
[2:16:35] for it yet and when would I be ready for
[2:16:37] it I don't know but she tried to invite
[2:16:39] me to some special meetings because
[2:16:41] there was a guest Minister coming to
[2:16:42] town and I I I I I thought I don't know
[2:16:46] I don't know and and there was a time
[2:16:50] where I was in the world and uh just
[2:16:52] like I told you earlier I heard the
[2:16:53] voice say to me you know do you want an
[2:16:55] answer on that question um I saw her
[2:16:58] phoning me as I was driving and this was
[2:17:00] before distracted driving laws by the
[2:17:02] way but I saw her phone on me and I was
[2:17:04] like oh no I don't want to answer she's
[2:17:05] just going to invite me to church no not
[2:17:07] going to answer and so I didn't and I
[2:17:09] heard that voice the same voice nowadays
[2:17:12] I can go back and connect the dots and
[2:17:13] say I recognize that voice but that
[2:17:16] voice said to me that just might be your
[2:17:17] last call
[2:17:21] and I I knew that wasn't for alcohol I
[2:17:24] was like
[2:17:25] man okay so I phoned her back and she
[2:17:28] said you thought I wanted you to come to
[2:17:29] church well I'm I'm not inviting you to
[2:17:31] church and I was like okay Dodge that
[2:17:35] one she said we're having a a get
[2:17:37] together and and you know we just like
[2:17:38] to invite you to come to that just uh
[2:17:41] like we had last night God bless you
[2:17:43] brother Nathan that was a wonderful time
[2:17:45] really enjoyed that but just to get
[2:17:47] together like that with the Believers
[2:17:48] and so that's where I went to but you
[2:17:50] know you know in going there there was
[2:17:53] one person that actually witnessed to me
[2:17:54] my wife didn't even witness to me I was
[2:17:57] sitting there and and I took the time to
[2:18:00] not really allow myself to get witnessed
[2:18:02] to I didn't want anybody to preach to me
[2:18:04] I just wanted to sort of get a feel for
[2:18:06] what's going on here and and it was
[2:18:08] really good until the end of the night
[2:18:11] right the end of the night there was a
[2:18:12] guy sitting beside the fire and you know
[2:18:14] we're in Calgary in July and it's not
[2:18:16] very warm I think in uh in Fahrenheit
[2:18:19] terms it would probably have been about
[2:18:22] 70° and so it's in the evening and this
[2:18:24] guy is sitting wearing jeans baggy jeans
[2:18:27] and a hoodie with a hood and uh I'm like
[2:18:29] you know he's my kind of people I was
[2:18:32] kind of running with some Motocross
[2:18:33] people and skateboarders at the time and
[2:18:36] it's just the people that I was with I
[2:18:37] wasn't really that way but I thought you
[2:18:40] know what safe to sit down beside him
[2:18:42] and so I went and I sat down beside him
[2:18:45] and the first words out of his mouth was
[2:18:47] so what church do you go to and I
[2:18:49] thought oh Lord here we
[2:18:52] go here we go so I took the time and I
[2:18:57] laid my case out I you know there was no
[2:18:59] hurry to go anywhere so I laid out the
[2:19:02] case real good and uh I didn't realize
[2:19:05] that this man was the minister for the
[2:19:07] weekend that just passed and this
[2:19:10] Minister was actually a
[2:19:12] lawyer some of you might know brother
[2:19:15] Aaron
[2:19:15] mcgi so he took he took my case and
[2:19:19] properly dissected Ed
[2:19:22] it and then handed it back to me and he
[2:19:24] said you know the way that you're
[2:19:26] judging all the people is causing you
[2:19:29] yourself to be that and I said to him
[2:19:33] that I actually you know I think there a
[2:19:35] lot of hypocrisy around Christianity
[2:19:38] there's a lot of hypocrisy people that
[2:19:39] claim one thing and do something else
[2:19:41] and we all know what that is but he said
[2:19:43] to me you know the way you're judging
[2:19:44] everyone to be this way is causing you
[2:19:46] yourself to be one and I was like wow
[2:19:50] okay
[2:19:52] kind of shattered my my thoughts about
[2:19:54] it you know and at the time I couldn't
[2:19:56] even remember what he
[2:19:58] said it wasn't until many years after I
[2:20:00] had to say to him what was it you told
[2:20:02] me there again I can't even remember it
[2:20:04] and he remembered he's a
[2:20:07] lawyer they
[2:20:09] remember but he told me that what the
[2:20:12] way you were judging everyone was
[2:20:13] causing you yourself to be a hypocrite
[2:20:15] and so you know that those words were
[2:20:17] just incredible for me because it was
[2:20:19] enough for me to say I need to go and
[2:20:21] take a look at this and now you can fast
[2:20:22] forward to where I said I went to church
[2:20:24] the very first time it wasn't a special
[2:20:26] meeting it wasn't a special Minister it
[2:20:28] was the
[2:20:29] pastor and by going to hear those words
[2:20:32] what happened while he yet spake those
[2:20:34] words I believe the Holy Ghost fell upon
[2:20:37] brother Barry and you know how I know
[2:20:40] that is everything in my life changed in
[2:20:42] that moment in that instant in that
[2:20:44] twinkling of an ey brothers and sisters
[2:20:46] my body was changed I was already in the
[2:20:49] Rapture in that moment
[2:20:51] and you know what it's no different for
[2:20:53] anyone else you might get the Holy Ghost
[2:20:55] because someone lays hands on you you
[2:20:56] might get the Holy Ghost because you get
[2:20:58] baptized in water you might get the Holy
[2:21:00] Ghost because someone preaches the word
[2:21:01] of
[2:21:02] God it's God don't try and put them in a
[2:21:05] box you try and put God in a box it's
[2:21:08] right there that he's going to chuckle
[2:21:09] and say you're not going to do it it's
[2:21:11] not going to happen but I just want to
[2:21:13] encourage us brothers and sisters that
[2:21:14] today today I just want to say you
[2:21:18] yourselves you're the Manifest ation of
[2:21:21] the Living Word of God when we have the
[2:21:25] ability to take the word I just think
[2:21:27] it's beautiful the way brother Bram says
[2:21:29] it the spirit born Spirit-filled man in
[2:21:33] faith takes the word of God in his heart
[2:21:37] and places it upon his lips it's no
[2:21:39] longer that man it's no longer that
[2:21:41] woman speaking it becomes deity speaking
[2:21:45] and you know that's the Holy Ghost is
[2:21:48] deity don't be afraid of the Holy Ghost
[2:21:51] be afraid of all the other
[2:21:53] ghosts but once you get the Holy Ghost
[2:21:56] brothers and sisters he casts out all
[2:21:58] fear you can go and walk through a
[2:22:00] graveyard you don't have to whistle
[2:22:02] because you know that you're never going
[2:22:03] to be there you're only going to be just
[2:22:05] traveling through you're going to be
[2:22:07] walking right through
[2:22:10] there my goodness I feel like I could
[2:22:14] just keep going and going
[2:22:16] here there Comes A Time brothers and
[2:22:18] sisters where we need to look past all
[2:22:21] all of our
[2:22:23] faults and just look to his
[2:22:26] word and that includes all of the people
[2:22:29] that we
[2:22:31] know one of the worst things that we can
[2:22:33] do as a human and I I'm not trying to
[2:22:36] get psychological at all one of the
[2:22:38] worst things that we can ever do as a
[2:22:40] human being is look at another human
[2:22:41] being and think that they should be
[2:22:42] another way and then get upset at them
[2:22:44] because they're not the way that we
[2:22:45] think they should
[2:22:47] be that's especially prevalent with
[2:22:49] parents it could can be that way with
[2:22:51] spouses can be that way with pastors and
[2:22:53] deacons and song leaders and sound
[2:22:56] guys it can be that with everyone don't
[2:22:58] do that we don't want to do that we want
[2:23:00] to look past all of our faults and look
[2:23:03] to Jesus Christ look at our brothers and
[2:23:06] sisters and say I see the manifestation
[2:23:09] of the Living Word in my brother and my
[2:23:10] sister right there that's God In the
[2:23:13] Flesh the manifestation of the Holy
[2:23:16] Spirit living out through that human
[2:23:18] being and you know what brother bradam
[2:23:21] says we can have a character
[2:23:22] assassination on our brother and our
[2:23:24] sister just by talking about them we
[2:23:26] don't want to do that brother Bram says
[2:23:28] say nice things say nice things about
[2:23:31] your brother or your sister personally I
[2:23:33] believe it you can actually create an
[2:23:35] atmosphere around that person by
[2:23:38] speaking nice things about them they can
[2:23:40] be hundreds of miles away brothers and
[2:23:43] sisters but you can speak nice things
[2:23:45] about our brothers and our
[2:23:47] sisters we need to look past our faults
[2:23:49] and just look to his word
[2:23:50] [Music]
[2:23:52] brother bam he says in the spoken word
[2:23:53] is the Original Seed now the power of
[2:23:56] the believing Church Christ has all
[2:23:59] power in heavens and earth you believe
[2:24:01] that congregation says amen he says now
[2:24:06] what if he's in
[2:24:08] you now what if he's in you I love how
[2:24:12] he does that he takes it and makes it
[2:24:14] personal and that's really the way God
[2:24:16] wants it to be a personal intimate
[2:24:19] relationship not something nothing
[2:24:20] that's just the church and the state
[2:24:22] something that's way out there it's just
[2:24:24] your pastor's relationship with the Lord
[2:24:26] no no no no
[2:24:27] no he says the seed of Christ must m u s
[2:24:31] t must come through his body not a
[2:24:37] denomination but through a born again
[2:24:40] seed of the word must come
[2:24:43] through now remember what is it it's
[2:24:46] Christ's seed and he says how does how
[2:24:49] does my seed come through through the
[2:24:50] body how does the apple tree seed come
[2:24:53] through the body seed is through the
[2:24:55] body and I'm going to throw this in this
[2:24:57] is Brother Barry's just injection
[2:24:58] brother bradam he even says it that
[2:24:59] healing comes through the
[2:25:04] body how does the apple tree seed come
[2:25:06] through the body seed is through the
[2:25:08] body and the church is the body of
[2:25:11] Christ that right now I'm I just want to
[2:25:15] just make it clear brother Barry ain't

[2:43:51] I I I certainly thank uh brother Barry
[2:43:54] for the sermon this morning I believe it
[2:43:56] was more than Barry I believe the Holy
[2:43:59] Spirit took a man and used his voice and
[2:44:01] his testimony and his experience with
[2:44:04] Christ and and I know you're enriched
[2:44:06] and you've been blessed and been spoke
[2:44:08] to it by it and I was just sitting
[2:44:10] chuckling when he said that the devil
[2:44:12] told him you know uh uh all they want
[2:44:15] down there was your money you know and
[2:44:16] your friends said take it you know it's
[2:44:18] it's the funniest thing how the devil
[2:44:20] dissects things isn't it because when
[2:44:23] brother Barry was talking he said I
[2:44:25] smoked cigarettes and I was an alcoholic
[2:44:27] but when he come to Christ and he
[2:44:29] started paying his tithing to the Lord
[2:44:33] do you know where' them cigarettes
[2:44:35] go where did all that beer he drank go
[2:44:39] how much money was he spending a week in
[2:44:41] cigarettes and beer and party and
[2:44:45] and and the devil didn't Point any of
[2:44:47] that out to him
[2:44:50] isn't that amazing how the devil speaks
[2:44:52] a certain thing to point
[2:44:55] out he probably traded a $1,000 a week
[2:44:58] habit for whatever little bit you know
[2:45:01] that you give
[2:45:02] back I tell you what I'd lot rather give
[2:45:05] m to the
[2:45:06] Lord I'd like rather give mine to the
[2:45:09] Lord amen that's
[2:45:13] right you know um I uh I I thank God for
[2:45:17] the life he's given us but brother Barry
[2:45:18] and I I've had some very Supernatural
[2:45:21] experiences with God you know uh one
[2:45:24] time that I know for sure that I saw a
[2:45:26] man raised from the dead brother Barry
[2:45:29] Johnson was standing right beside me
[2:45:32] Zachariah wherever he's at this morning
[2:45:34] right Zach was standing on the other
[2:45:36] side of me and we were standing over the
[2:45:39] body of his Pastor brother Ken
[2:45:42] borer and brother Ken was laying there
[2:45:44] he had just had a serious serious
[2:45:46] four-wheeler accident and he was laying
[2:45:49] there and he was breathing uh he you
[2:45:52] know I I it it was just a
[2:45:54] gasp and then all of a sudden the gas
[2:45:58] stopped and brother Barry looked over at
[2:46:01] me and said brother Wayne what are we
[2:46:03] going to
[2:46:04] do we didn't have no phone signal we
[2:46:07] couldn't call in an ambulance there was
[2:46:09] no medical
[2:46:11] staff and I looked at brother Barry I
[2:46:13] said brother Barry God has so arranged
[2:46:15] things that the only thing we can do is
[2:46:18] call call on the name of the
[2:46:20] Lord and Barry and I and
[2:46:23] Zachariah and uh Logan borer reach down
[2:46:28] and put our hand upon brother brother
[2:46:30] Ken and I said these simple words I said
[2:46:32] Lord Jesus you've arranged this so we
[2:46:35] have no one to call but you this is a
[2:46:38] pastor and his congregation needs him
[2:46:41] God would you give his life back to him
[2:46:44] and the man started pulling a breath
[2:46:45] it's like you could
[2:46:47] hear it's like breath just came back in
[2:46:49] and he stood to his feet from from that
[2:46:52] and immediately stood to his feet and
