[3:51] appreciate him to do that amen and uh we
[3:54] we certainly appreciate I seen Brother

[3:58] Kyle and amen uh I think brother
[4:00] Richard's here this morning a lot of
[4:02] visiting ministers and we want to thank
[4:04] you and welcome you amen amen and if we
[4:08] could Ephesians chapter 1 verse 9 and
[4:11] verse 10 amen
[4:16] uh verse n and verse
[4:20] 10
[4:22] now having made known unto us the
[4:26] mystery of his will according to the
[4:30] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[4:33] himself that in the
[4:36] dispensation of the fullness of times
[4:39] that he might gather together in all one
[4:41] one in all things in Christ both which
[4:45] are in heaven and which are on earth
[4:49] even in him amen we ask the Lord to
[4:53] bless his word as you could be seated
[4:55] this morning amen I'd like to take again
[4:58] this portion of scripture here for the
[4:59] book of Ephesians and um I want to I
[5:02] want to speak about the mystery of his
[5:04] coming revealing the mystery of his will
[5:07] and I'm going to use this for a subtext
[5:09] so that you can kind of see where my uh
[5:11] where my thought lines are laying amen
[5:14] uh amen and uh we certainly appreciate
[5:18] uh having Brian and Gracie with us today
[5:20] and amen it's always a blessing amen and
[5:23] uh I know the Lord's been working in his
[5:25] life and Ministry so maybe it won't be
[5:27] long we'll be hearing from him sometime
[5:29] I mean I know uh I know God's moving on
[5:32] his heart in a great way so y'all be
[5:34] praying for him amen amen uh I want to
[5:37] just speak just a few minutes today uh
[5:40] here in the scripture and just uh
[5:43] something something that's just been uh
[5:45] speaking to me personally from this I
[5:47] want to read here um a little bit of
[5:50] from the Amplified Bible I love how this
[5:52] reads it said making known to us the
[5:55] mystery secret of his will of his plan
[5:58] of his purpose do you believe God has a
[6:00] plan he has a purpose he has a will amen
[6:05] and and here it is in
[6:08] accordance see with his good pleasure
[6:11] his merciful intention so God has an
[6:14] intention he has a plan he has a purpose
[6:17] amen and he has previously purposed and
[6:20] set forth in him so this is a previous
[6:23] plan it's a previous intention and it's
[6:26] just been hid until this time so what
[6:29] you're what you're coming into is not
[6:31] something new it's something that's been
[6:33] there the whole time it's just not been
[6:36] made known now he planned uh in the 10th
[6:39] verse for the maturity of times now this
[6:42] speaking the dispensation the fullness
[6:43] of time the maturing of times in other
[6:45] words God planned for scriptures to be
[6:48] manifest he planned for the specific
[6:50] times uh that these things would happen
[6:53] and the climax of the ages to unify all
[6:56] things and head them up in the
[6:57] consummation of Christ you you see like
[6:59] even the the climax of The the
[7:01] Resurrection the fullness of time
[7:02] brother B actually places this as the
[7:05] resurrection but yet we know there's
[7:07] some things that are connected to the
[7:09] resurrection right we're not we're not
[7:11] just going to look around one day and
[7:12] everybody's bodies are changed as such
[7:14] as denomination would have us believe
[7:16] that the world's just going to go right
[7:17] on then there's going to come a change
[7:19] and it's all going to happen but God has
[7:21] previously planned how he would bring
[7:24] this consummation or how this climax
[7:26] would come and then we of course then
[7:29] understand the mystery of his will is
[7:31] then tied to the mystery of his coming
[7:34] and so when you go back in this I love
[7:36] the word Myster on here it's a powerful
[7:38] one it literally means amen something
[7:41] into which one must be
[7:43] initiated it means in something in other
[7:46] words there's there's a plan there's a
[7:48] purpose there's a mystery but it means
[7:50] you must be initiated into that mystery
[7:53] so it isn't something maybe the whole
[7:55] world will even know about but the ones
[7:57] that have been brought into it then they
[7:59] will actually know about it can I say it
[8:01] like if you was in Military and they
[8:02] said we're going to deploy at a certain
[8:04] time the whole world doesn't know that
[8:06] but it's more on a need to no basis and
[8:09] since you're the bride of Christ and
[8:11] you're a part of this plan and purpose
[8:14] there is a need for you to know the will
[8:16] of God and the time of this Resurrection
[8:19] because you're actually a part of it
[8:21] amen now watch to be initiated it means
[8:24] to be fully known this a mural it means
[8:27] to initiate or to instruct anything
[8:29] which is concealed or hidden we commonly
[8:31] use the word to denote that which is
[8:33] above our comprehension like a mystery
[8:35] it's above comprehension or it's
[8:37] unintelligible but there is there there
[8:40] but this is never the meaning of this
[8:42] word in the New Testament it means that
[8:44] there's some Doctrine or fact which has
[8:46] been concealed or which has not been
[8:48] before fully revealed or which has been
[8:51] set forth only by figures and symbols
[8:53] which is the case these things brother
[8:55] man said had been revealed in every type
[8:58] in the Bible but not known until it's
[9:01] revealed that's why when the seals open
[9:03] the Bible become a new book it was in
[9:05] every type but not known right now in
[9:08] which it has been set forth by figures
[9:10] and symbols with the doctrine made known
[9:12] then it becomes as clear and as plain as
[9:15] any other so in other words when when
[9:17] someone builds their Ministry on the
[9:19] Mysteries well you know automatically
[9:21] something's wrong with their Ministry
[9:23] because there's no mystery left to the
[9:25] church amen the mystery has been
[9:28] revealed to the church at this given
[9:30] time uh hillbilly are to be able to
[9:33] preach the greatest depths in the in the
[9:35] Bible because they've been plainly
[9:37] revealed to the church amen so that
[9:40] takes away the oneman Ministries right
[9:42] and it takes away the personality
[9:45] Ministries where you must follow me or
[9:47] you're out in the darkness or amen what
[9:49] a lie from the devil this message has
[9:51] been made clear to all the people of God
[9:55] so that this is not just a pull pit
[9:57] Ministry it is a bride body Ministry of
[10:00] Jesus Christ and you each one have been
[10:03] inducted or initiated into the things of
[10:06] God and and and we got I I don't want to
[10:09] just brag on them but we got young
[10:11] people that can confound
[10:13] theologians because they have the answer
[10:15] they might not be able to say John 2
[10:17] equals John 6 and this goes here and
[10:19] this goes here but they have the answer
[10:21] to it already they they just simply got
[10:23] the answer which is what everybody's
[10:25] looking for but see we got the cheat
[10:28] sheet amen we got the code we got the
[10:30] original intention of the word and here
[10:33] we are taking the test with an open
[10:36] book that's right you bypassed your
[10:39] theophany to come here to be tempted and
[10:41] tested and the Bible tells us amen that
[10:44] there would come a bride who will not
[10:45] fail amen and brother Bram says the
[10:47] bride cannot fail well how do you not
[10:49] fail the test it's because the book has
[10:52] been opened and you've received the
[10:54] answers from the one who gives the test
[10:57] amen it's almost seems like like it's a
[10:59] locked in thing right amen that God has
[11:02] locked you into his purpose and plan and
[11:05] now he's revealing this amen so it's
[11:07] clearly known it's something that has
[11:09] been open brother baham says it here in
[11:11] the adoption he said see there's tied
[11:13] something together for me he said the
[11:15] mystery of his coming and the Mystery of
[11:18] his will and the Mystery of us sitting
[11:21] together now there's three mysteries
[11:22] there and you're using the word mystery
[11:24] and I'm using that because brother bam
[11:25] is saying this has been unknown so we're
[11:28] going to call it a mystery
[11:29] but today it is a revelation in the
[11:32] church see so we could just change it to
[11:34] the revelation of his coming the
[11:36] revelation of his will and the
[11:38] revelation of our position in it see now
[11:42] the mystery of his coming or the
[11:44] revelation of his coming simply I just
[11:46] spoke on it the other day so I won't go
[11:47] deep in it but just to remind you here
[11:50] that the mystery of his coming we're
[11:52] speaking about the coming of Elohim
[11:54] right that's what we're talking about
[11:56] when we let's go to Abraham's one of the
[11:58] greatest View views of it that we could
[11:59] see Abraham was promised Isaac to come
[12:03] through Sarah and it would take a
[12:05] supernatural birth a change of the body
[12:08] before they could receive Isaac so he
[12:10] was the coming son but before Isaac
[12:13] could come Elohim had to visit the tent
[12:16] so that they would be in a place to have
[12:18] Isaac and brother R says we were
[12:21] expecting to receive Jesus Christ in a
[12:23] glorified body but the bride meets him
[12:26] in the air he said so we must have a
[12:29] life a a body change to go meet him as
[12:32] Abraham and Sarah then their body change
[12:35] came through an Elohim Ministry that
[12:38] stood at the tent door and revealed the
[12:40] secrets of the hearts is that right so
[12:43] has the church in this hour receive the
[12:45] ministry of the son of man which was
[12:47] none other than Elohim himself coming
[12:50] from Jesus's own words as it was in the
[12:53] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[12:55] coming of the son of man so we call son
[12:57] of man milk kind Elohim whatever we want
[13:00] to speak of now that don't never get
[13:02] that mixed up and say well that was
[13:04] brother Bram brother Bram said I can't
[13:05] be him he said but he is here right and
[13:08] my Ministry is to declare him he said
[13:11] now now now you know the prophet is
[13:13] saying over and over and over who is
[13:15] that that knows the secret of your heart
[13:17] and who is that that knew where you come
[13:19] from and who is that he said I don't
[13:21] know you amen but come and know the one
[13:24] that knows you isn't that scripture that
[13:27] the Bible said You shall be known and
[13:30] you shall know even as you're known that
[13:32] there would come a Ministry like that
[13:34] amen just before the changing of the
[13:36] body that would come the coming of
[13:38] Elohim now now the Revelation brother
[13:41] Ram delivered us is that he is an
[13:42] unchanging God with an unchanging nature
[13:46] amen and an unchanging attitude but he
[13:49] does have a changing of mask and he
[13:52] moves from the son of man in fatherhood
[13:55] the son of man in Jesus as the son but
[13:58] in the last days the Holy Ghost would
[14:00] manifest that same ministry again right
[14:04] so we find out it's a changing of mass
[14:06] not a changing of God so here we're
[14:08] looking in this age of a bride coming of
[14:12] Christ amen the son of man coming amen
[14:15] now brother Bram says very clearly he
[14:17] packs three names he PRS the son of man
[14:19] the Son of God and the son of David the
[14:23] same God just under a different
[14:26] Administration right and in the fullness
[14:29] of times if you read Ephesians chap 1
[14:31] and: 10 you'll see that the actual word
[14:33] means the
[14:34] administration and here we are under a
[14:37] son of man Administration now simple put
[14:40] the little woman the sodan that came to
[14:43] Jesus and she wanted the healing of her
[14:45] daughter remember what she did she said
[14:47] thou son of David have mercy on me
[14:49] brother Ram said he wouldn't even look
[14:50] at her amen because she was a gentile he
[14:54] was him he was God In the Flesh but
[14:56] wouldn't ADM wouldn't speak to her at
[14:58] all all amen because she was coming in
[15:00] the wrong office but when she changed
[15:03] from saying son of David amen and she
[15:05] said Lord then she found her power
[15:09] because she came in the right
[15:11] Administration man I don't know how to
[15:14] maybe say it to you I'll say it to you
[15:15] like this if you're still trying to
[15:17] approach God as a Pentecostal you're not
[15:20] going to get anything from God Amen he
[15:23] has changed from the Son of God to the
[15:25] son of man and it's now under a
[15:27] prophetic office you can't ignore this
[15:30] message and get what you want from God
[15:33] it is his administration in this hour
[15:36] it's the way to come to the mercy of God
[15:39] in this dispensation of Grace that we're
[15:41] living in the fullness of times has come
[15:45] the scriptures have been fulfilled look
[15:47] we're not have the resurrection yet but
[15:50] there's no scripture at would bar the
[15:53] resurrection from happening this morning
[15:56] in the Church of the Living God the
[15:58] scripture have been fulfilled we are at
[16:00] the maturing of times we are at the
[16:02] climax of all things amen when the Bible
[16:05] said he would swear amen that there
[16:07] would be time no more the prophet said
[16:10] no more delay upon the visions of God it
[16:15] is the administration right amen amen
[16:18] now amen you you if you want to if you
[16:20] want to see it from a different view
[16:22] maybe political view you can watch how
[16:24] the presidencies change amen and you can
[16:27] get the same power but you have a
[16:29] different
[16:31] Administration amen you you've seen it
[16:33] in the driver's license office and amen
[16:36] and in a little one Horse Town there's
[16:38] one person walking in working in there
[16:39] and they're they're working in one
[16:41] office and maybe it's the revenue or the
[16:43] tax office and they said well you can't
[16:44] get that done here you got to go to the
[16:46] title office and you go over the title
[16:48] office and the same person rolls their
[16:49] chair over to the desk amen you just
[16:52] can't do it at the same place it has to
[16:54] be done at another place it's the same
[16:57] God sir but he has a different
[16:59] Administration in this hour we are under
[17:03] a word Prophet a king God has returned
[17:07] as the king of the
[17:10] church amen right he is the headship of
[17:13] the church not the prophet the pillar of
[17:17] fire now watch because what is happening
[17:20] is that you're seeing the mystery of
[17:23] that coming if you can see that's him
[17:25] now you're opening yourself to something
[17:27] Matthew or Daniel chapter 12 the Bible
[17:30] said go thy Way Daniel and seal the
[17:32] words and close them until the time of
[17:34] the end in the 10th verse Daniel said
[17:37] many shall be purified and made wide and
[17:40] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[17:43] and none of the wicked shall understand
[17:46] but the wise shall understand amen but
[17:51] the wise shall understand isn't that
[17:53] powerful amen here's prophecy over your
[17:56] life the wise will will know the mystery
[18:00] of the will of God now if you uh I'm
[18:03] getting ahead of myself in the book of
[18:05] Ephesians but I'd like to just read it
[18:07] Ephesians chapter
[18:08] 5:14 wherefore he saith await thou that
[18:11] sleepest and arise from the dead for
[18:14] Christ shall give thee light amen see
[18:17] then now give thee light now I don't
[18:18] have time to preach on that but y'all
[18:21] understand light scriptural light is
[18:22] word manifest God will manifest the word
[18:26] for you amen he will give the light then
[18:29] when you see that you walk circumspectly
[18:31] not as fools but as wise he said
[18:34] Redeeming the time because the days are
[18:36] evil wherefore be ye not
[18:41] unwise but understanding what the will
[18:44] of the Lord is isn't that amazing
[18:47] understanding the will of the Lord
[18:50] listen you'll never understand the will
[18:52] of God without the word of God Amen the
[18:55] only way to know the will of God is the
[18:57] word of God now now you you can go into
[18:59] the brother Ram's Ministry and you can
[19:01] see he said there were first two pools
[19:03] and there was a a gift of Divine Healing
[19:05] and prophecy he said but they were both
[19:07] permissive will of God he said but the
[19:10] third pull brought the perfect will of
[19:13] God now what's he talking about because
[19:15] he's not just Discerning the person but
[19:17] under the third pull it is the
[19:19] Discerning of the heart of God
[19:21] concerning the scriptures so we're now
[19:23] getting the perfect meaning of the word
[19:27] from the original word that was written
[19:29] now let just go into it like this
[19:31] brother R said unless we know the word
[19:33] of God we don't know what to do we can't
[19:35] have faith until we know what it is the
[19:38] will of God then see then if we know it
[19:41] is the will of God the word of God says
[19:43] something then we can gladly follow it
[19:45] but we got to know what the will of God
[19:47] is now how would we know the will of God
[19:49] something beautiful I seen years ago
[19:51] when I was uh there in in in Jerusalem I
[19:53] went to the temple Institute and there
[19:55] is actually kind of like a new Sanhedrin
[19:57] Council basically and they're a temple
[20:00] Institute group of people that are
[20:01] building the're they're building the new
[20:03] Temple they ain't got started yet but
[20:05] they're going to build it I I mean it's
[20:06] neat how they're doing but they said we
[20:08] can't get on the actual uh Temple Mound
[20:11] any if any of you ever been there a
[20:13] rabbi Rickman I think his name is he's a
[20:16] great Theologian there and he took us up
[20:18] on the Temple Mount itself but they got
[20:19] rules you can't pray up there amen up on
[20:22] the Temple Mount because there's the the
[20:24] the mosque of alar is there you know
[20:25] it's one of the second I think holy
[20:27] sites of the Muslims and and if it's
[20:30] it's a big study but there's three seeds
[20:32] right there's ishma Isaac and then
[20:34] there's uh the the super seed which is
[20:37] the Christian so there's three seeds
[20:39] after the same land and but but Ishmael
[20:42] right now holds that land as a
[20:44] stronghold but actually Israel legally
[20:46] holds it but political pressure keeps
[20:49] them out of it but Rabbi Rickman can
[20:51] still go up there but he can't pray up
[20:53] there so Chris was up there with us it
[20:55] was the neatest thing cuz we get to walk
[20:56] and this Rabbi starts talking to us he
[20:58] knows we're all Christians and most of
[20:59] us was preachers on this trip and he
[21:01] starts walking and he starts walking
[21:03] around this Temple Mount he said y'all
[21:04] just go walk with me and we just start
[21:06] walking a complete circumference around
[21:08] that Temple Mount And he says you know
[21:10] they won't let us pray but you all from
[21:11] the Book of Joshua know what I'm doing
[21:13] and he was just he was just walking that
[21:16] Temple Mount he said he knew his
[21:18] footsteps were possession on that
[21:20] mountain he was bringing prophecy to it
[21:22] you know and and and when we got to got
[21:25] to talking to him later he went in and
[21:27] he started showing us I I I pronounced
[21:30] the word odd I know I think it's called
[21:31] a manura manura amen it's the it's the
[21:34] seven lampstands that goes into the
[21:36] temple and they got that thing made out
[21:37] of gold he said they're going to come a
[21:39] time we're going to build the temple he
[21:40] said but we want the Articles ready for
[21:43] the temple before the Temple's built so
[21:45] like if they ever get the temple built
[21:46] they got stuff ready to go in it right
[21:48] then the furniture is built and and so
[21:50] they were doing this but one thing that
[21:52] I found that they were doing is they had
[21:54] a lot of guys studying scripture to
[21:57] figure figure out what color or shade of
[22:00] blue that the inner Veil should be like
[22:03] there's a there's a blue curtain that
[22:05] hangs between the holies and the holies
[22:07] of holies and and that curtain was
[22:09] important to Moses and he said it would
[22:12] be a shade of blue but but how many
[22:14] shades of blues right here in this
[22:15] building this morning I'm wearing two
[22:16] shades right now amen so if you just say
[22:19] blue that's one thing but what shade of
[22:21] blue now according to the Old Testament
[22:24] you get something wrong like that and
[22:25] you die so the shade of blue was an
[22:28] important thing to the Israel and
[22:29] there's men who are spending their whole
[22:31] lives looking into what shade of blue a
[22:34] curtain supposed to be and I was sitting
[22:36] there watching that and I thought isn't
[22:38] that something they're studying and
[22:39] studying and studying and at their best
[22:41] guess they're never going to KN know for
[22:43] sure which one cuz they if you're more
[22:46] influential than that guy is and they
[22:48] trust you more than that guy then his
[22:50] idea of the shade of blue has more
[22:51] opinion than his shade of blue and maybe
[22:53] there's 30 says it should be this way
[22:55] and 40 says it should be this way and
[22:57] really will you ever actually know for
[22:59] sure what shade of blue that is but let
[23:03] let let a prophet walk in that room let
[23:06] Moses walk in that room and said well
[23:08] when I seen it in heaven it's this shade
[23:11] of blue now you have thus saith the Lord
[23:14] on the will of God according to the
[23:16] shade of blue well they've had 2,000
[23:19] years of doctors of divinities and
[23:21] theologians trying to figure out water
[23:23] baptism they're trying to figure out the
[23:25] godhead they're trying to figure out
[23:27] predes ation amen and and they got one's
[23:30] got a bigger denomination and one's got
[23:32] a bigger group one's got more money amen
[23:34] but how would you ever know unless God
[23:37] would send the prophet among the church
[23:40] and say thus sayith the Lord here's the
[23:44] answer according to the original
[23:47] documents and we have received of the
[23:50] Lord in this hour a Vindicated truth to
[23:53] know exactly what we were looking
[23:56] for yes sir amen do you see what it is
[23:59] it's a revealing of the wheel now
[24:01] according to Revelations the 10th
[24:03] chapter it is prophesied that mystery
[24:05] would be settled in this age now the
[24:08] real thing see what what we what we look
[24:11] at if you want to pick this up third
[24:12] seal it's a beautiful uh first portion
[24:14] of the third seals beautiful readings
[24:16] but when you start reading brother Bram
[24:18] is telling us he says that see there's
[24:20] supposed to come a real thing now now if
[24:23] if you're if you're in comparison of
[24:26] scriptures that God sends something to
[24:30] bring reality to what substitutes are
[24:34] now we all know that from the time of
[24:37] the Garden of Eden Jesus was promised to
[24:39] Eve in the garden in the time of her
[24:42] fall he said the woman shall have a seed
[24:44] and he shall bruise the head of the
[24:45] serpent now brother man says what he was
[24:47] promising her was that Christ would
[24:50] become the word see the word would
[24:53] become a seed and a woman would have a
[24:55] seed and that seed the word would redeem
[24:57] the woman he said and until that time
[25:00] come he gave her substitutes of blood
[25:03] sacrifices right he said but when Jesus
[25:05] came who was the Incarnate God who got
[25:09] into the blood cell and was the real
[25:11] exact thing that God had promised in the
[25:14] Garden of Eden see when God made the
[25:16] promise everything from the Garden of
[25:18] Eden all the way to Jesus Christ was a
[25:21] substitute of his coming he was the real
[25:25] thing that God promised in the garden of
[25:27] Eden but by the time he got there there
[25:31] was so much tradition and so much
[25:33] misunderstanding that the people missed
[25:36] him the original word and Let It Go by
[25:39] them now I got I got scripture here amen
[25:42] it's amazing to me that the very
[25:44] Apostles that walked with him missed
[25:46] it y'all now I mean I'm not talking
[25:49] about just everybody missed it his very
[25:52] Apostles missed it the scripture in
[25:54] Matthew 17 when Jesus come off of Mount
[25:56] Transfiguration it said the scribes
[25:59] asked him saying why sayest thou Elias
[26:02] must first
[26:03] come and Jesus said to them he's come
[26:07] already and you didn't know it the
[26:10] Apostles of God the elect of God missed
[26:14] John the Baptist as the coming of Elijah
[26:17] but that very one turn around and says
[26:19] yes he has come already but he shall
[26:23] come and restore all
[26:25] things now in that beautiful that little
[26:28] word restore all things now now the
[26:32] Bible tells us in the book of Acts the
[26:34] third chapter that the heavens must
[26:36] receive Jesus Christ until the
[26:38] restitution of all things so whatever
[26:41] you think about John the Baptist he
[26:42] didn't fulfill all things he didn't
[26:46] restore all things even after the death
[26:49] burial in Jesus there was still a need
[26:51] of
[26:52] restoration isn't it a m now that's a
[26:54] powerful area to study but when you
[26:57] start looking at this now here's
[26:59] something brother Ram will load up if
[27:00] you like to study the message in in in
[27:03] and if you like to break it in context
[27:05] and really see the the Deep meanings of
[27:07] what brother Ram is talking about he
[27:09] begins the third seal with talking about
[27:11] everybody missed it yeah amen he begins
[27:13] the third seal by saying look the
[27:15] scripture said the apostles missed it
[27:17] amen it was so humble even the apostles
[27:21] missed it amen in John 1 and: 10 the
[27:24] Bible said he was in the world and the
[27:27] world was made by him and the world knew
[27:30] him not and he came unto his own and his
[27:34] own received it not now it's is amazing
[27:38] they missed both the messenger and his
[27:41] message they missed both Elijah and the
[27:45] Messiah they had a double portion of
[27:49] evidence of the scriptures being
[27:51] fulfilled and they missed it now watch
[27:53] the prophet of God says it he said they
[27:55] missed it there he said now now here's
[27:58] the thing they all missed it they missed
[28:01] it he said they missed it a million
[28:03] miles and they missed it with John they
[28:06] missed it with Elijah they missed it
[28:07] with Jesus he said they missed it all
[28:10] the way through and they'll do the same
[28:13] thing
[28:14] today they miss it now isn't this
[28:16] amazing because when you start looking
[28:18] at this they all missed it it's now
[28:20] we're we're looking back and we're
[28:22] saying well we would have knew it would
[28:23] you have knew it the apostles missed it
[28:27] on listen this is powerful it wasn't
[28:30] even prophesied to be a
[28:32] secret the Bible in Isaiah 40 said that
[28:35] the mountains would be made High The
[28:37] Valleys made High and the mountains made
[28:38] low amen there would be a great movement
[28:42] and and they wouldn't be able to but
[28:43] when it came they missed the prophecy so
[28:46] brother Ram says it he says they missed
[28:48] it all they missed Jesus they missed
[28:50] Elijah they missed everything now here's
[28:52] the beautiful thing he then turns around
[28:55] brother BR he he's such an amazing
[28:56] preacher cuz he's building the idea
[28:58] everybody missed it and then he stops
[29:00] and says now you're sitting here saying
[29:01] brother B then why should I
[29:03] try if they all missed it amen what
[29:07] makes me different than anybody else
[29:09] wouldn't I miss it too and the real
[29:12] truth of the matter is yes you
[29:14] would but brother BR says see but you
[29:16] haven't he says but now if you say
[29:19] there's no need of me trying he says
[29:21] listen you got the wrong kind of Faith
[29:24] he says if you're going to say it like
[29:26] that see you got the wrong kind of Faith
[29:29] he says because I want to live close to
[29:30] him and I know he's going to come and
[29:32] take me when he comes if everybody else
[29:36] misses
[29:37] it I'm going to be there by his grace he
[29:42] promised me that amen if everybody
[29:45] misses it I'm going to be there now
[29:48] listen youed to preacher you ain't got
[29:49] no listen there was eight in the days of
[29:52] Noah but there was eight of them there
[29:54] was one in the days of Enoch but there
[29:56] was one of them so you have enough
[29:59] scriptural evidence to know no matter
[30:01] how narrow it becomes that will always
[30:05] have one and I say this this morning
[30:07] I'll be that one if there's only one I'm
[30:10] going to be that one and I believe you
[30:12] could say the same thing about yourself
[30:14] this morning and say brother count me
[30:18] in I'm one of them amen am man we could
[30:21] break out in song couldn't we I'm one of
[30:24] them I'm one of them now you see what it
[30:28] was because it was substitutes were hung
[30:32] on to in the place of the real thing now
[30:36] the first bride that fell from her
[30:38] husband he says well she fail because
[30:41] she reasoned the word that was why she
[30:44] failed but when she failed brother R
[30:47] says but God full of Mercy made a way to
[30:49] redeem that woman and promised her
[30:52] telling her sometime in the future the
[30:55] true word would return to her again the
[30:57] true word would be made known to her now
[30:59] remember he promised that through Christ
[31:02] he says watch now the true word would be
[31:04] made known to her remember he promised
[31:08] Christ through the
[31:11] woman right he promised Christ through
[31:15] the woman now I hope you're hearing me
[31:18] Eve amen his promise was Christ through
[31:22] the
[31:23] woman there's a promise over your life
[31:26] Christ Christ through you in this day is
[31:31] the manifesting of the will of God of
[31:33] your life you wasn't put here just to be
[31:36] a carpenter you wasn't put here just to
[31:38] be a mechanic you wasn't put here amen
[31:41] just to be a computer technician you
[31:44] were put here to descend Christ into
[31:47] this godforsaken age Christ should come
[31:50] to this age and you are the provided and
[31:53] chosen vessel God did this before the
[31:56] world ever
[31:59] began listen amen I don't care how
[32:01] faroul you fall it was a promise to you
[32:04] and God always keeps his
[32:07] promises you said brother Wayne I can't
[32:09] do it the Bible said you'll do it Christ
[32:12] is that word that's right he is that
[32:15] word the word is coming back to you
[32:19] after so long a Time the word is coming
[32:21] back to you I want your class to see
[32:23] this what did she fall from now that's a
[32:27] powerful question a prophet is asking
[32:29] you if you're going to be restored you
[32:31] got to understand what you fell from she
[32:34] did not fall from being a woman that
[32:37] wasn't her she didn't fall from being a
[32:38] human she fell from the
[32:42] word isn't that amazing amen the only
[32:46] thing she fell from was the word
[32:49] everything else was an attribute of the
[32:51] Fall yes sir every other thing was only
[32:55] an attribute because of the Fall all
[32:57] these other things are there you said
[32:59] well she fell from this and fell from
[33:00] this and fell no she fell from the
[33:02] word because if we can see what she fell
[33:05] from we can see God's intention of
[33:08] restoration if God had her fall by the
[33:11] word then God has to restore the word
[33:14] and if he restores the word everything
[33:18] else is restored when the word is
[33:21] restored listen church we don't have to
[33:24] restore all the gifts restore the word
[33:27] we don't have to restore the shouting
[33:28] restore the word if you restore the word
[33:32] the church itself is backing the power
[33:35] and the atonement of God and what it was
[33:37] meant to be for you restore the
[33:41] word come on we're not living in the age
[33:43] of reformation of gifts we're living in
[33:45] the age of the restoration of the word
[33:47] of God that'll put us back the mind of
[33:50] God before the world ever
[33:54] began my B were there incidentally I I
[33:57] really appreciated brother Ray's sermon
[33:58] last Sunday wow wasn't that
[34:02] good I think it's the best I ever heard
[34:04] on 1 Corinthians 13 honestly powerful
[34:08] thought amen now the word is coming back
[34:12] God said he would make a way to redeem
[34:14] her the word had to do it watch this The
[34:18] Substitute will be given until the time
[34:21] the original word comes you can have a
[34:25] substitute but it only there until the
[34:28] word comes isn't it powerful when Jesus
[34:32] came the Bible said here ye men of
[34:34] Israel Jesus of Nazareth a man approved
[34:37] of God among you by Miracles and wonders
[34:41] and signs which God did by him in the
[34:43] midst of you even yourselves also know
[34:46] brother said God approved him man missed
[34:50] him look at the power of that wow man
[34:53] missed him God approved him but even in
[34:57] God's approval he was still missed he
[34:59] was the real promised
[35:03] Messiah David spoke of him Moses spoke
[35:07] of him Elijah spoke of him listen every
[35:10] one of them was a type of
[35:12] Jesus but none of them was
[35:15] Jesus but Jesus was all of
[35:19] them he was David he was Elijah he was
[35:22] John are you hearing me now amen do
[35:24] watch this now justification is not the
[35:27] real thing though it spoke of it
[35:30] sanctification is not the real thing
[35:31] though it spoke of it even the baptism
[35:34] of the spirit is not the real thing
[35:36] though it spoke of it but when the word
[35:39] came it is all of them it is
[35:41] justification sanctification and the
[35:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is
[35:45] everything that God is when the word is
[35:48] restored the real promised has been made
[35:52] now here's the thing she was promised
[35:54] that original Eve was promised to have a
[35:56] Redeemer and that Redeemer would be the
[36:00] word amen that Redeemer would be the
[36:02] word I need a handkerchief somebody got
[36:04] one amen and that real Redeemer was the
[36:07] word and when the word came and made
[36:09] flesh thank you which one's the clean
[36:16] side the Redeemer would be the word and
[36:19] when the word came and was made flesh it
[36:22] was
[36:22] rejected because of her
[36:25] substitute in that thing isn't that
[36:27] amazing someone would take something God
[36:29] give them as a substitute and use it to
[36:32] reject the real wow is't that something
[36:36] because in the substitute was the
[36:39] original it literally spoke of it but it
[36:42] wasn't it but when that came amen now
[36:47] watch brother bam says see you got a
[36:49] natural and a spiritual type when e fell
[36:52] she was given substitute until the time
[36:55] Jesus came yeah amen he said which she
[36:58] held to her substitute and turned down
[37:01] the word y but then he says the ones
[37:04] that received the word went up to
[37:06] Pentecost received the spirit and became
[37:09] the Hebrew the Hebrew children became
[37:12] amen the the second Eve was birthed
[37:15] there at Pentecost he said but watch
[37:18] this but she went to NAA the same way
[37:22] that the first Eve spoke to the serpent
[37:24] in the garden he said and and she fell
[37:27] the same way that Eve fell one fell in
[37:31] the garden the other fell in
[37:33] NAA two eeve both had a fall and he said
[37:36] the same way God promised to the first
[37:39] Eve that I will redeem you by the word
[37:42] he said so as the second received a
[37:44] promise before they ever fail Jesus
[37:48] already talked about a restoration
[37:50] before they ever even fell at n because
[37:53] he knew they would fall at NAA because
[37:56] the sea
[37:57] had to go into the ground for the bride
[38:00] Church come on friends they come to
[38:02] perfection in that early church for one
[38:04] reason to be planted in the ground but
[38:07] one day Perfection will return one day
[38:10] Perfection returns under this word and
[38:12] we're receiving Perfection today not to
[38:15] go into the ground but to be raised up
[38:18] from the dead and our bodies to be
[38:20] changed in the age we're living in amen
[38:23] when that which is perfect has come
[38:26] that's when the bride of Christ will be
[38:28] changed we're being
[38:32] changed W Hallelujah the Perfection of
[38:36] the word returns to the church for our
[38:40] [Applause]
[38:44] Redemption hallelujah thank you Lord now
[38:48] the prophet said the same way they
[38:49] missed him the people today will miss
[38:53] this if they miss it does it make it any
[38:56] less
[38:57] real you see people are thinking okay
[39:00] they're thinking the church needs to
[39:02] receive a Jesus and then get the message
[39:06] now I know this church don't teach it
[39:08] but I've heard it a
[39:09] bunch we need to get them to this to to
[39:13] Jesus and then get them to the
[39:16] message let me put it in let me put it
[39:18] in different words for you in the days
[39:20] of Jesus Jesus is walking on the shore
[39:23] of Galilee amen and and somebody say
[39:26] John I know you're pointing at this man
[39:28] here but what you need to do is get the
[39:31] people to the traditions and go back
[39:32] into the elders and then let the elders
[39:34] get them
[39:37] there you mean with the word manifested
[39:41] clearly before us and you want me to
[39:44] point to the substitute that was given
[39:47] until this came listen friends I refuse
[39:50] to point at the history of the church to
[39:53] find the God who is alive when that sh
[39:56] Jesus has resurrected in my day with
[39:59] perfect manifestations we have evidence
[40:03] we have evidence the infallible
[40:05] resurrection of Jesus Christ has come
[40:08] into this age amen and I'm not ashamed
[40:10] of it come on if you're trying to preach
[40:13] William brandom as Jesus Christ you're
[40:16] an antichrist yourself but the real
[40:19] bride knows that it wasn't him he was
[40:23] introducing
[40:25] him
[40:28] amen now folks brother Ram said that he
[40:31] said you're an antichrist you make me an
[40:34] antichrist that's why people have a hard
[40:37] time introducing the message CU somebody
[40:38] has taught them the message as brother
[40:41] brand brother brandom didn't teach that
[40:43] God's Ministry don't teach that we are
[40:46] Christians from the very essence of the
[40:47] word Christian we are not Baptist we are
[40:50] not methodists we are not Lutheran we
[40:53] are the original church that God had in
[40:56] the book of Acts amen the book of Acts
[40:58] is living again a branch has come out of
[41:05] God well I feel like it
[41:10] hallelujah it's a reality the word they
[41:13] miss the word because they held to the
[41:17] substitute now you can hold the
[41:19] substitute all you want but you're going
[41:20] to miss the real thing when you
[41:23] do it's up to you yeah you can't have
[41:27] two husbands at the same
[41:31] time you got to die to one and let the
[41:34] other
[41:35] live now brother Bram said that's the
[41:38] reason today I know some of you heard
[41:41] this quote a lot but I want you to hear
[41:42] it in in this direction yes sir that's
[41:44] the reason today the revivals we're
[41:47] supposed to
[41:49] have but we don't have them now isn't
[41:53] that amazing that's the reason today now
[41:56] now you can hear a lot of excuses of why
[41:59] there's no
[42:02] Revival well brother see we just believe
[42:05] in teaching
[42:08] here we think you people are a little
[42:10] fanatical over on that emotional side so
[42:13] we try to keep things a little more sane
[42:15] a little more
[42:17] sensible that's the reason there's no
[42:22] Revival see but the prophet is telling
[42:24] us there a Revival he says we're
[42:28] supposed to
[42:30] have we're supposed to have Revival you
[42:33] see because it was made promised to us
[42:36] look at this the reason there is no
[42:38] Revival he says because we haven't had
[42:41] that
[42:42] staring don't think we got revivals we
[42:45] haven't we got millions and millions of
[42:47] church members but Revival
[42:50] nowhere he says see but the bride hasn't
[42:53] had a Revival
[42:55] yet there's been no Revival there no
[42:59] manifestation of God to stare that bride
[43:02] we're looking for it now now y'all was
[43:04] with me the other Sunday remember look
[43:05] to it prisoner on the sell look look at
[43:08] the message and see if it ain't look to
[43:10] it and see he says see they're looking
[43:12] for that
[43:13] Revival I love how brother Ram says it
[43:16] now it would take those seven unknown
[43:18] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[43:21] he'll send it he promised he would now
[43:24] because somebody made something out of
[43:26] the Thunders that it wasn't everybody's
[43:28] got scarecrow religion when it comes to
[43:31] the seven Thunders but the seven
[43:32] Thunders were to give us faith for
[43:34] Rapture Grace they were to give us faith
[43:36] for a change of the body the seven
[43:38] Thunders were supposed to awaken the
[43:40] bride and put a Revival back in them and
[43:42] if you put the seven Thunders as some
[43:44] understanding of some man I got why
[43:46] you're scared of it bab but before they
[43:49] gave you a substitute there was a real
[43:52] seven Thunders and the real seven
[43:55] Thunders is the voice of God that sounds
[43:59] in the last
[44:02] days y'all know I'm in the message I
[44:04] don't have time to preach all of it amen
[44:06] but it's a voice that sounds it's the
[44:08] ministry of the seventh angel God sent
[44:11] the Revival by the word do you see it
[44:15] hey man why are they missing
[44:18] it now why why they miss things back
[44:21] there see but why are they missing watch
[44:24] watch what prophet's trying to lay
[44:25] something out he sends it he sends it
[44:27] such a way but they miss it cuz there's
[44:30] been no manifestation yeah now now I
[44:33] don't want to get into deep areas here
[44:34] but let's just just just touch this can
[44:36] we just touch this we've already had the
[44:39] Revival in South
[44:41] Africa 30,000 were saved blind eyes were
[44:44] healed uh insane man was touched
[44:47] cripples were
[44:48] walking but there's been no
[44:52] manifestation y Amen to awaken the bride
[44:57] so that wasn't the wakeup call for the
[45:00] Bride come on church that wasn't going
[45:03] to wake this bright up but the prophet
[45:05] said it would take the seven unknown
[45:07] Thunders and y'all know I'm in the
[45:08] scripture in Revelation 10:7 the seventh
[45:11] angel sounds in Malachi 4 it's Elijah is
[45:14] to turn the hearts or restore the church
[45:17] brother random are them two different
[45:19] men oh no it's one angel with two
[45:21] aspects to his ministry he will reveal
[45:24] the mystery of the seven Thunders and
[45:26] the preaching of that will
[45:28] literally turn the hearts of these
[45:31] children back to their Apostolic fathers
[45:34] We Don't Preach the message here because
[45:35] we're Fanatics we're not preaching the
[45:37] message cuz we're cultish it is the very
[45:40] reason there is Revival is because we
[45:43] have a message we are not just shouting
[45:46] to shout we are not churching to church
[45:48] we're not singing to sing there's a
[45:51] message there's a message of a king and
[45:54] he's coming to this earth yeah and we're
[45:56] a part of the coming of the
[46:00] Lord Brother man said the reason they're
[46:03] missing it is because they won't plead
[46:04] the
[46:08] promise if they would plead the promise
[46:11] it would become effective to them that's
[46:13] right now y'all know what he says by
[46:15] your Traditions you made the word of God
[46:17] in no effect brother R said the word
[46:18] manifested in that day said to them
[46:20] disciple or said to the Pharisees your
[46:23] Traditions make the word no effect here
[46:26] the word in this age is saying to
[46:28] another group of people the Traditions
[46:31] you hold are making the word without
[46:35] effect isn't that something now y'all
[46:38] know the scriptures and you know the
[46:39] message brother Bram said I Indi the
[46:42] generation for the second crucifixion of
[46:43] Jesus Christ he said not his
[46:46] flesh but they're crucifying the effect
[46:50] of this
[46:52] word yes sir but it would become
[46:55] effective if we would see it in the
[46:58] promise if you could see that this is
[47:02] that that the Bible prophesied of this
[47:05] hour brother wouldn't nobody have to
[47:07] excite you we'd be trying to figure ways
[47:09] to calm you down it wouldn't be nobody
[47:11] have to sit amen try to pump you up and
[47:14] try to make you do amen we be figuring
[47:15] out ways to quieten the church down
[47:18] Hallelujah I say preach the message and
[47:21] let the power of the message andite the
[47:23] church in the Revival that God has given
[47:26] to this age I don't know about y'all I'm
[47:29] dead with Dead traditions I'm done with
[47:31] disaffected messages of a former age I
[47:34] say preach the message of the hour and
[47:37] let the coming of Christ be the Revival
[47:40] of the Church of the Living
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:47] [Music]
[47:48] God now brother manam immediately goes
[47:51] into recognizing your day amen he does
[47:54] it there in that third seal and he says
[47:56] they've missed it Herald of his coming
[47:58] we need a prophet but in recognizing
[48:01] your day he says you've
[48:05] missed you've not recognized third seal
[48:09] he keeps saying it again and again they
[48:10] missed it they missed it they missed it
[48:11] they missed it the title recognizing
[48:15] your day yes
[48:17] sir they have not
[48:20] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[48:23] it's happening right before them yes and
[48:26] they don't see
[48:27] it isn't that something well he's a
[48:30] drunk soldier's
[48:32] son oh he's illegitimate he's a bastard
[48:35] child am something they could ridicule
[48:38] make fun of and talk about and put a
[48:40] black name on and push it out of their
[48:43] churches and so have they done it again
[48:46] in this age behold I stand at the door
[48:50] and knock and if anybody would let me in
[48:53] if anybody lets the voice of God in I'll
[48:55] come in unto
[48:57] them isn't it
[48:59] amazing they missed the Awakening and
[49:02] brother Bram said if we would plead the
[49:04] promise if we would plead the promise he
[49:07] said it would make it
[49:09] effective it would make it effective now
[49:12] can we just take just a moment let's
[49:13] read this he says listen now God
[49:15] promised it that he would vindicate the
[49:18] word for her and still she wouldn't do
[49:21] it all right but God promised her by
[49:23] servants the prophets God promised prom
[49:25] through Jesus Christ so say Jesus made
[49:28] the promise he promised through
[49:31] Joel he promised through Paul he
[49:34] promised through Malachi and he promised
[49:37] through John I love how brother Bram
[49:39] does this he then turns and says now if
[49:41] you want to write them down of course
[49:43] Jesus made the promise in John
[49:46] 14:12 may I add Luke 17:30 yes
[49:49] sir Joel made the promise in Joel 2 and
[49:53] 38 Paul made made the promise in 2
[49:56] Timothy 3 Malachi made the promise in
[50:00] Malachi 4 the 4th chapter John made the
[50:03] promise in Revelations the 10th chapter
[50:06] what is it see you would you could
[50:09] exactly what would take place now to the
[50:11] church what is it the Incarnate Word
[50:15] made flesh amongst his people
[50:20] again now watching the third seal now
[50:23] brother Ram says the church is coming
[50:24] out of the age justification
[50:28] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:31] Incarnate
[50:34] Word right listen he goes see it becomes
[50:38] Incarnate Word in the Masterpiece
[50:40] brother Ram said justification made a
[50:42] way for sanctification sanctification
[50:45] made a way for the baptism of the spirit
[50:47] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a
[50:49] way for the Holy Ghost himself to come
[50:52] into Perfection back to the word word
[50:57] again what was it amen the word came and
[51:01] they missed
[51:02] it the word has came and the world is
[51:06] missing it but there was some that saw
[51:10] it and I'll say this to you had it not
[51:13] been pointed out to them they would have
[51:15] missed
[51:17] it Peter would have missed the whole
[51:19] thing fishing out there and and and busy
[51:22] with
[51:24] life but Jesus came to
[51:27] him Jesus found
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:31] him Hallelujah that's right he come up
[51:35] to him remember this he says thy name is
[51:38] joh uh Peter Simon and thy father's name
[51:41] is Jonas brother mam says it like this
[51:43] he said see but in here he said down in
[51:47] his heart was a predestinated
[51:50] seed and Jesus walked right up to him
[51:53] and said I'll go down there to the meat
[51:55] eat and see he walks right up there
[51:57] Jesus standing there just an ordinary
[51:59] looking fellow walked up he said your
[52:01] name is Simon and your father's name was
[52:04] Jonas that deflated him that listen to
[52:08] this that little eternal life
[52:12] seed it struck in there why didn't Peter
[52:16] miss it eternal life
[52:21] seed watch the prophet he says it he
[52:23] said oh that's the truth you've been he
[52:27] comes to this woman at the well he said
[52:29] you've been running around with five and
[52:30] this is the sixth husband you've had
[52:33] five I've told you the truth watch what
[52:35] was it the light struck that seed it had
[52:38] been laying there that was spoke by God
[52:41] yes sir the seed was on the earth when
[52:45] God moved the Mars away the sun hit it
[52:49] and it come up that's right when the
[52:53] Holy Spirit in him mooved moved away her
[52:56] past life and showed it to her that
[53:00] light Struck
[53:02] it now I don't know if you see what
[53:03] brother Brandon's doing here but he's
[53:06] made this little woman the Earth that
[53:09] was back there without form and void and
[53:12] darkness was upon the deep and seeds
[53:14] laid beneath the water brother BR said
[53:17] the reason it happened so fast there at
[53:19] the whale is because the seed was
[53:21] already there isn't it amazing that's
[53:24] why it happened so with you that's why
[53:27] you didn't have to go through maybe 10
[53:28] years to figure it out but something
[53:30] happened to you it happened fast it's
[53:33] because there's a seed in there listen
[53:35] you might be sitting here this morning
[53:37] and had all kinds of questions but let
[53:40] the spirit roll back the past life and
[53:43] watch God Quicken that seed come on Amen
[53:47] I love altars but you don't need an
[53:48] altar you need the light to strike the
[53:52] seed you need the light of this word to
[53:55] manifest over your
[53:57] life and when the light strikes the seed
[54:00] brother it's over then it's not up one
[54:03] day and down the next day it's over then
[54:06] I know in whom I have
[54:10] believed when that light strikes that
[54:13] seed finishes the
[54:16] matter
[54:18] Lord oh brother man said see because the
[54:20] light Struck it they couldn't see it
[54:23] because of their Traditions but that
[54:24] prostitute
[54:27] isn't that something but that prostitute
[54:30] that farmer all of them saw it that was
[54:34] predestinated when the doubts are rolled
[54:36] away the seed went to Growing see they
[54:40] were ordained to eternal life before the
[54:43] foundation of the world and when the
[54:45] light Struck it they knew
[54:50] it when this true Vindication the
[54:52] revealed truth of God's word strikes a
[54:54] heart he'll strike the water and Y with
[54:57] the Holy Ghost as hard as she could go
[54:59] you couldn't stop him from doing it
[55:02] because life had worked forth hallelujah
[55:05] amen this is in the fourth seal brother
[55:06] ramond says in Genesis
[55:08] 1 he lays out the picture of Genesis 1
[55:13] and he said I believe every seed was
[55:14] laying there from another civilization
[55:16] or something and as soon as the water
[55:18] lifted off the light Struck it and up
[55:21] come the trees and everything and the
[55:23] same thing with a human being
[55:26] all the mids moved away the revealed
[55:28] true seed laying there is gerti as the
[55:31] light of the Gospel can Strike It by
[55:32] true
[55:34] Vindication so preacher what are you
[55:35] talking about brother B said them seeds
[55:37] were there from another
[55:40] civilization somebody said well I maybe
[55:42] there were other worlds or whatever I'll
[55:43] tell you what I believe I believe God
[55:45] had a civilization in his mind before
[55:48] anything ever began that was something
[55:50] in his mind and the will of God in his
[55:53] mind laid the seat seeds of a future
[55:56] civilization and when he laid them seeds
[55:59] all he had to do is move the water and
[56:01] strike the seed and that same God
[56:05] foresaw this lay out TOA age and in it
[56:08] he put seeds he laid seeds in this age
[56:11] and in this age with all the water that
[56:14] was over it when a prophet stood there
[56:16] amen and begin to prophesy over this
[56:18] generation he moved the waters back off
[56:21] of the seeds I was upon your life and
[56:24] when the light Struck it brother it was
[56:26] over then it's over after that she left
[56:29] her water pot and said come see a man
[56:33] sir listen listen if it was just a good
[56:36] story why did all them disciples give
[56:38] their life for

[1:02:24] field amen but the God he served did not
[1:02:28] leave this field he stayed with the
[1:02:31] Church of the Living God and now there
[1:02:34] is an increase of the son of man in the
[1:02:37] Church of the Living God it is getting
[1:02:39] greater and greater and greater and
[1:02:41] greater and greater I feel an explosion
[1:02:44] lifting in the Church of the Living God
[1:02:47] he has increased in our
[1:02:49] [Applause]
[1:02:53] lives he fulfilled it see he was
[1:02:56] bringing the word once the word was
[1:02:58] introduced The Prophet stepped
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:03] away I don't have time to look into it
[1:03:07] but I I I'll simply just put it like
[1:03:09] this amen you're trying to get through
[1:03:11] here to Christ and all the denominations
[1:03:15] are between you and
[1:03:18] Christ brother random comes
[1:03:22] along and said okay boy
[1:03:25] go through the
[1:03:27] hole message preachers are coming back
[1:03:32] now and they replaced it with brother
[1:03:35] brandom so now there's something between
[1:03:38] you and your maker it is an antichrist
[1:03:42] teaching he said there is no man between
[1:03:46] God and man except the man Christ
[1:03:49] Jesus William brandom introduced us to
[1:03:52] Jesus Christ the son of of God which is
[1:03:55] his
[1:03:58] word and any preacher that says he's not
[1:04:01] the same yesterday today and forever did
[1:04:03] not get his anointing from
[1:04:06] God anything the book of Acts did this
[1:04:09] Bride Can Do Anything is in God's word
[1:04:13] belongs to this church not yesterday not
[1:04:17] tomorrow but
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:22] today Hallelujah now somebody said well
[1:04:26] brother Wayne is that a little offensive
[1:04:27] to brother Bram not brother
[1:04:30] brandham oh no not brother brandom
[1:04:32] brother BR be shouting higher than you
[1:04:33] are somebody got the
[1:04:36] point there's a bride understanding his
[1:04:44] message see the bridegroom's voice this
[1:04:48] is where the joy was fulfilled of the
[1:04:51] bridegroom's friend yeah when brother
[1:04:54] Bram heard his voice this was his Joy
[1:04:58] the voice was speaking if you want to
[1:05:00] look at it brother Bram says we have
[1:05:02] seen and heard the voice of God speaking
[1:05:04] through the word and we know what hour
[1:05:07] we're living in on listen the pillar of
[1:05:11] fire is here it had a voice in it and
[1:05:15] that voice was the voice of God that
[1:05:18] Vindicated this
[1:05:20] word now the voice of vindication speaks
[1:05:23] the loudest
[1:05:25] it's the Roar of the line when
[1:05:27] Vindication speaks you've heard from God
[1:05:30] brother said for a man to say it is one
[1:05:32] thing but when God fulfills it it's
[1:05:35] another thing the voice of vindication
[1:05:38] is the voice of God that speaks to the
[1:05:40] bride Church the voice of God through
[1:05:43] the word that's what the eagle heard and
[1:05:46] that's what he recognized was a voice he
[1:05:49] recognized the voice that's where the
[1:05:51] church has recognized the voice of God
[1:05:54] God vindicating this word listen when
[1:05:56] you catch the Revelation this really is
[1:06:00] Malachi 4 sir this really is Luke 17
[1:06:04] this really is first Thessalonians this
[1:06:06] really is Matthew 24 and Daniel the 12th
[1:06:09] chapter this really is Revelations 3 and
[1:06:12] Revelations 5 and Revelations 9 and
[1:06:14] Revelations 10 and Revelations 9 this
[1:06:17] really is the word of the age brother
[1:06:19] I'll tell you what it'll do it'll
[1:06:21] explode something in your life you can't
[1:06:24] fast and pray long enough to get where
[1:06:26] I'm talking about amen fasting and
[1:06:29] prayer are great it will never put you
[1:06:31] in the place I'm talking
[1:06:34] about you can come to this altar every
[1:06:37] day of your life you will never get
[1:06:39] where I'm talking about I'm talking
[1:06:41] about the one that has placed you in the
[1:06:44] mind of God from the foundation of the
[1:06:47] world only the word can put you
[1:06:53] there
[1:06:56] yes sir now now it's a powerful thing to
[1:06:59] me cuz this is the the whole message of
[1:07:02] the third seal brother Bram keeps
[1:07:04] talking about this and then he comes
[1:07:06] down and he says listen let's get to the
[1:07:09] good part now I know it's getting late
[1:07:11] I'm not going to take a long time on the
[1:07:12] good
[1:07:15] part but it says this is the good part I
[1:07:18] love it when a prophet says we're
[1:07:19] getting to the good
[1:07:20] part yeah hurt not
[1:07:25] the oil and the
[1:07:27] wine brother BR said that wasn't one of
[1:07:30] those beasts that said it right he said
[1:07:32] this one spoke from the
[1:07:34] throne he said it was the lamb said hurt
[1:07:38] not the oil and the wine brother B said
[1:07:42] what is the oil he said the oil is the
[1:07:45] Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost it is the spirit that moves
[1:07:49] through the
[1:07:50] church don't hurt
[1:07:52] that don't quench that don't touch that
[1:07:57] that's what brings life that's what
[1:08:00] brings quickening that what's brings
[1:08:02] anointing in the church Jesus said don't
[1:08:05] touch it Paul said quench not the spirit
[1:08:09] of God do you see what it is it's a
[1:08:11] spirit that moves and brother man said
[1:08:13] oil and wine always went together always
[1:08:17] went together in worship he said but I
[1:08:19] wondered what that wine represented he
[1:08:21] said then I saw it he said natural wine
[1:08:25] when it has its
[1:08:27] effect natural wine stimulates a person
[1:08:32] in their body it's when you drink
[1:08:34] natural wine it has an effect are you
[1:08:38] hearing me by your Traditions you make
[1:08:41] the wine of no effect brother man said
[1:08:44] but Revelation is as natural wine it is
[1:08:47] a spiritual wine he said or as the Bible
[1:08:50] calls it the new wine amen amen am he
[1:08:54] says and it should have the same
[1:08:58] effect I didn't make it up folks a
[1:09:01] prophet said it it ought to have an
[1:09:03] effect on the
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:06] church Revelation stimulates the bride
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:13] church it's the wine at the
[1:09:17] marriage and he saved the
[1:09:20] best for last it's the miracle of the
[1:09:24] wine we are in another marriage but it's
[1:09:27] our marriage it's our marriage we are
[1:09:31] the marriage Le the lamb and the wine of
[1:09:34] Revelation has been spread out among the
[1:09:39] church I I'm not trying to be mean I'm
[1:09:41] trying to be honest let me just say it
[1:09:43] real honest where does this leave all of
[1:09:45] our great teachers
[1:09:46] then when the more they teach the colder
[1:09:49] the church
[1:09:52] gets by your tradition you're killing
[1:09:56] the effect of this
[1:09:57] Revelation this Revelation is built to
[1:10:00] stimulate this bride should not have to
[1:10:03] suck on a Pentecostal bottle to find an
[1:10:06] anointing this bride shouldn't have to
[1:10:08] clap their hands till they're crazy to
[1:10:11] get into an anointing the message should
[1:10:14] produce an anointing that would change
[1:10:16] your body that would change your life
[1:10:19] come on
[1:10:21] church this is not coming from emotion
[1:10:24] this is a word
[1:10:27] based and if this word is preached with
[1:10:30] re Revelation it will bring stimulation
[1:10:33] and faith and it'll bring an effect upon
[1:10:35] the
[1:10:41] church it's the
[1:10:43] truth funny thing is you won't even have
[1:10:45] to be in church
[1:10:47] sometimes I don't think you just shout
[1:10:50] when you're in church amen I was down in
[1:10:52] North Carolina and heard Brother Ray
[1:10:54] breaking open that 1 Corinthians 13 I
[1:10:56] wanted to get out of the car and do a
[1:10:58] jig when he started into that I said
[1:11:01] glory to God that's the Revelation that
[1:11:03] was meant for that scripture and it
[1:11:06] would just it was just surging over me I
[1:11:08] could feel the life of it it had life in
[1:11:10] it it didn't kill my tongues it didn't
[1:11:13] kill my gifts it didn't kill my
[1:11:16] anointing it let me know it's okay just
[1:11:20] keep it in the
[1:11:22] word come on Church anybody's preaching
[1:11:25] that takes the shouting out of the
[1:11:27] church wrong
[1:11:29] preaching anybody's preaching that takes
[1:11:31] the amen out of the church wrong
[1:11:33] preaching but if you preach this message
[1:11:36] with power and without tradition it'll
[1:11:38] bring Revival in the heart of your
[1:11:43] people stimulated by the revelation of
[1:11:46] this word it should have the same effect
[1:11:48] upon you as natural wine has upon a
[1:11:51] human
[1:11:52] being
[1:11:55] oh I think we ought to pass the wine
[1:11:57] bottle again in the house of God let us
[1:11:59] lose our cares let us lose our Ambitions
[1:12:02] let us Le our dignitary ways and our
[1:12:05] formalism let us get so drunk we don't
[1:12:07] know what our family name is or what the
[1:12:10] ideas of the others are and God I say
[1:12:13] pour out the blessings of God until
[1:12:16] Every Soul feels the anointing of
[1:12:19] God Hall brother car I believe we can
