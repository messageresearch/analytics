We'd like to welcome each of you. And [music] as you turn in your Bibles to the book of Luke, the 2 chapter. Amen. We're going to read a few verses here. Uh Luke chapter uh one uh 2 verse one down to verse 21. Amen. Luke chapter 2. Amen. Uh brother Nathan, can I bug you to read this tonight? Amen. He does such a good job reading and this is such a beautiful story. A lot of scripture here. So it's written out if you'd like to read it. 21 And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was first made when Sirenius was governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea into the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child. And so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And he brought she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for him for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you. Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men." And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us." And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. God bless you as you could be seated. Amen. A very, [clears throat] very beautiful and life-changing moment in the history of the church. &gt;&gt; You know, um I uh have studied brother Brandham for years. And uh as I think this is just passing 30 years of ministry and listening to the prophet and many times during the Christmas season, Brother Brandon would take a a text and he would preach concerning Christ or about the birth of Christ and he would take a text and speak on things. And I just thought it was uh just uh just going through I I think I've read several of the books and listened to several tapes just in the last few days and just uh thought I would share a few things with you tonight. uh some things that the prophet had said about this type in this season. He said, 'You know, uh, this is why Bethlehem 1963. He said, 'You know, at Christmas, I think we all, too many of us, I wouldn't say all, but too many of us lose the real value of what Christmas is. And I noticed even out in the palm trees, they have it decorated. And in the east, it's the fur tree and the evergreen. And months or weeks, rather month or six months before Christmas even begins, uh, they start tensil and commercial. and instead of what it really means. I don't believe that Christ was born on the 25th day of December. I do not believe that at all. I would believe it be impossible for these things. Of course, we just read the story of his birth. On the hills of Judea are snowy and waste deep snow and month of December up in Judea. But we realize in studying history, Christ was probably born in the spring long about April or May, something like that. But when it was changed, see, is when Christianity was converted into Romanism and they made the son of God's birthday, sun god's birthday, which was a solar of the 25th, the 25th to the 25th of December, 21st, 25th of December, the setting of the sun almost changes at all. And then that was the son of the sun god's birthday. So they just changed it to the son of god. you know uh that's uh you know you can talk about we talk about the birth of Christ but then there is actually the birth of Christmas which began uh in Rome under Constantine whenever Christianity was being mingled with paganism and and Constantine actually used it as a way to get Christians to enter pagan festivals. That was his concept. So Jesus was never born on the 25th day of December. rather he would have been born sometime in April along in that season whenever lambs were actually born and brother man says but see but remember whatever day that it might be it still doesn't take away the sacredness of what it's supposed to be &gt;&gt; now where Satan has robbed us of this is he's made a commercial and the Santa Claus has stoleed all of the worship and it's become like Easter with bunny rabbits and pink ducks and things like this what's it got to do with Easter and what's it got to do with the resurrection of Christ it's just like the world today. Kids on the street can tell you more about David Crockett than Jesus Christ. They can tell you about some outlaw or some criminal, the prince of life. See, but born 1900 years ago. Now, that doesn't take away from the real thing from Christians. Now, you see, light shines its best in the darkness. And the forkid light in the black of cloudy skies at night shows that there can be light in darkness. And when the light is shining, see I if this if the sun's shining, you don't have much need of light. You don't see it too much. But the darker the smaller the light and greater will it shine in the darkness. The darker the better. &gt;&gt; It shows itself better. And we Christians ought to be testifying to the glory of God giving to us his son. See the Christmas ought to be an outstanding thing. When we Christians, no matter how much it looks, it makes it shine that much better. The whole world's got tinsel, but we've got Christ, and that's what it ought to be. Letting our uh light shine in a dark hour that we're now living in. Now, God's gifts always find their places. This is about maybe close to 10 days later. Brother Ram says, "See, Christianity, we've uh Rome was uh being this was converted Rome into Christianity in the way of Rome. We'll make the same celebration and we'll make the son of god's birthday, the son god Jupiter's birthday, then the son of god the 25th of December. See, but what difference does it make? I love a prophet. He he tells you exactly what the 25th day of December is. It's the sun god's birthday. A pagan uh the the soloulless of the sun. It was a winter feast that the pagans was in. And when Constantine made Christianity legal, they just said, "What we'll do is we'll call it the son of God's birthday." And then they would worship and and they would make a celebration during that time. But here comes along a prophet 2,00 nearly 2,000 years later because this is from 8,300. And brother Bam says, "But what difference does it make?" He said, "See, today if there was if we was doing this in July or we was doing this in August or whenever it might be, it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us hope that we have in us." Amen. Well, the rest of them, now you say, "Well, the rest of them's all Santa Claus and going on like that. We ought to just do it as well." No, sir. This is not a pagan celebration to us. &gt;&gt; This is a sacred hour. If there had been no Christmas, there would be no resurrection. If there had been no Christmas, there had been no love. If there had been no peace, there had been no hereafter for the believer, if there would have been no Christmas. Well, if the rest of the world, Brother Bram said, the forked lightning in the black cloudy sky shows there can be light in the time of darkness. And these lights tonight prove that there can be light in the dark time. And when does a light shine its best? In darkness. And when the turn the lights on in the daytime, the sun is shining. You'll hardly notice they're even on. But when we see it shine is a bright times and the time of darkness. And right now is the darkness when every Christian should give a testimony of the hope that is in him of Jesus Christ the son of God. Not some Chris Kringle that was born back yonder, you know, not some kind of tree lit up and down through the forest one night and some fiction story. Now, there's no bottom to it, but we believe solidly on the promised word of God coming, the Messiah, and he was born on Christmas day. Amen. You said, "Well, Brother Wayne, I I tell you, I I think that brother Brandham is such a powerful reality to the way things ought to be." Here's 1963, we have seen the star. And now, but in this hour of darkness, I say that we uh we live in still Christians should be holding forth a light that there is a truth to Christmas. That is the birth of Jesus Christ, the son of God. The zigzag forkid lightning and dark, cloudy, angry skies shows that there can be light in darkness. It proves that there can be light. In the darkness of the darkest of times, there can still be light. Amen. I certainly believe that's why God put you here on this earth. that there would be light in the time of darkness, in this dark age, and all these things that are going on, but there would be believers in the middle of it that would still shine a light. Amen. I I I thank God tonight for it. Don't you? I The other day I was doing something there at the house and Eevee come crawled up in my lap and and she had something toy or something she was wanting to play with, wanting me to play with. And she looks up at me and she said, "Oh, papa." She said, "You know, does the Bible say you ought to love your enemies?" And I said, "Uh-huh." She said, "Papa, is is the devil your enemy?" [laughter] I said, 'Well, man, you know, she she putting it on me pretty good. So, she said, "Well, does he have a daddy and a mommy?" I said, "Well, God created the devil." And she started laughing. She said, "That's funny, papa." She said, "That's funny." I said, "Well, God created him, but he wasn't always bad." She said, "That's right. He wasn't always bad, was he?" I said, "He wasn't always bad." She said, "Well, it's when he wanted everyone to worship him instead of Jesus. That's when he turned bad." I said, "That's when he went bad, Eevee. That's when he went bad." And out of the blue, she says, "But you know, Papa," she said, "Santa Claus is bad, ain't he?" I never heard a 5-year-old say Santa Claus was bad. She says, "Santa Claus is bad, Papa." And I said, "He is?" She said, "Oma, now that's Sister Don Carter." He said, "Oma told me that he takes all the glory away from Jesus." I said, "I'm going to have to thank your your your for letting you know that this Santa Claus has taken all the glory away from Jesus." Amen. And I I certainly don't believe that there ought to be glory given to a a Santa Claus during the time when Christians are to be remembering what God has done for us in this generation and what he's done for you and me. Amen. Uh brother man would pick odd sermons during Christmas and this is one of them in the falling apart of the world. He said, "There's the appearing of a star in all these Christmas stories that's going to make up our re religious belief today." He said, "They're very good." He said, "I I thought in the church this morning, probably our pastor maybe to next Sunday will bring a message on some of those things like that." And I thought if give but then I thought to give to the people a change of view about Christmas. Amen. And I want to I want to preach a text from that tonight. Amen. a prophet changes our view about Christmas. Amen. I I think that's what we really needed in this generation was a prophetic view of Christmas because we've got a Roman view of Christmas and we got pagan belief in Christmas. We got the Jews that don't even believe there was a Christmas. Then we got modern Christmas. We got all kinds of people with with ideas about Christmas. But you know, I believe a prophet can give us a good view of what Christmas ought to be. Don't you? I I think a prophet can give that view. And and I I've studied Brother Bannon for years and and having studied him, I think if you lay all of his Christmas messages side by side, and I've about done it this last two days. If you live most of those side by side, you're going to find that a consistent message will emerge out of every one of them. He's not trying to create a holiday sermon. He's not trying to create a tradition, but he's trying to correct the meaning of Christmas to turn hearts to a present reality. Amen. Brother Brandham is repeatedly pointing out to us December the 25th is not Christ's birthday. But you see, but when the pagan customs have replaced the spiritual meaning, the world begins to celebrate history rather and then they begin to miss life. Amen. He's not attacking Christmas to be harsh. He's just trying to bring truth into the church. This is not about a manger 2,000 years ago, but it's about the word being born into manifestation. See, if you take what brother Brandham uses, the word Christmas, if you would go Christmas equals, it equals the revelation of God made flesh. That's what it was about to brother Brandham. It wasn't about a a manger years ago. It's about the word coming into manifestation. That's right. Brother Random is talking about a Christmas that never finishes. He's talking about Christ was born in Bethlehem, but how he must be born again today in Bethlehem with every son and daughter of God. Christmas is God entering the flesh by the word. AND UNLESS THE SAME WORD COMES INTO you to be born again, amen, by a revelation, you're only celebrating history. AMEN. BUT WE OUGHT TO BE CELEBRATING LIFE. WE OUGHT NOT BE CELEBRATING a baby. We ought to receive THE WORD. WE OUGHT TO BE KEEPING A SEASON. And we ought to be keeping THE PRESENCE OF GOD. WE OUGHT NOT BE LOOKING BACK. WE OUGHT TO BE RECOGNIZING HIM TODAY. NOT CELEBRATING A TRADITION, BUT EXPERIENCING THE INCARNATION OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD IN THE SEASON WE'RE LIVING IN. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY PEOPLE GO WHAT WAY. AMEN. THE GREATEST DAY IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND IS WHEN CHRIST COMES INTO THE HUMAN HEART AND CHANGES MANKIND. WE ARE NOT A TRADITION. WE ARE A LIVING REALITY OF A LIVING GOD IN THE SEASON THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. I love how a prophet begins in 1949 and he says, "I'm speaking this morning on the deity of Jesus Christ though so you'll know that he is not so that you'll know he is that what we are worshiping today. We are not worshiping a baby in a manger and we ARE NOT WORSHIPING SANTA CLAUS BUT WE ARE WORSHIPING ALMIGHTY God in the deity of his son." There is a truth in Christianity, folks. I know the world today have had put it off on all these traditions and all these ideas, but there is a truth in Christianity and there is a truth in the birth of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. AND YOU KNOW, we we look back in the Bible and we see here in Luke 2 how we read of our Lord Jesus coming into EARTH. NOW, YOU CAN GO BACK TO Genesis and you can find how the devil come into flesh, can't you? You can look and see the story of the serpent seed and how that Eve lay with a serpent and brought the devil into the flesh of Cain and Cain began the lineage of the devil in human flesh. But we have to go to the book that look of Luke the 2 chapter TO SEE HOW GOD entered human flesh. And God entered human flesh through a virgin birth. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He entered flesh through a virgin birth by overshadowing Mary by THE HOLY GHOST AND CREATING A BLOOD sail on the INSIDE OF A WOMAN. BECAUSE SEE, WHEN MAN FELL BACK IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, HE COULD NOT save himself no more. MAN COULD not do something to bring himself out of the pit in which he fell. But it would take blood, a blood sacrifice to save mankind, would it not? But then man could not save man because man WAS ALL FALLEN AND THERE WAS NO MAN THAT WASN'T A SINNER. SO IT WOULD TAKE GOD TO SAVE MAN. BUT IT WOULD TAKE BLOOD TO SACRIFICE TO SAVE MAN. SO THE ONLY HOPE WE HAD WAS THAT THE GOD, THE SINLESS GOD, THE SPIRIT GOD WOULD CREATE A HUMAN BLOOD CELL THAT WAS A SINLESS BLOOD CELL. AND THAT BLOOD CELL COULD BE SACRIFICED FOR YOU AND I SO THAT WE WOULD NOT BE SAVED BY THE BLOOD OF A JEW. OR WE WOULDN'T BE SAVED BY THE BLOOD OF A GENTILE, BUT WE WOULD BE SAVED BY THE BLOOD OF ALMIGHTY GOD BECAUSE IT WAS THE CREATED BLOOD of Almighty God. SOMEBODY SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, HOW WAS IT THE BLOOD OF GOD?" IT'S BECAUSE THAT it was creative. God didn't have blood, but God created blood. Amen. You you see that JOSEPH WAS NOT JESUS'S FATHER. AND MARY WAS not his mother. I'm sorry. The Catholics teach immaculate birth. And they almost they do teach that that Mary herself was immaculate. THAT SHE WAS BORN WITHOUT a sin desire because she was going to be the mother of God. She was not the mother of God. SHE WAS A BORROWED WOMB. LIKE HE had a borrowed tomb. LIKE HE HAD A BORROWED BOAT. LIKE HE HAD A BORROWED BODY. AMEN. BUT JESUS CAME THROUGH THE OVERSHADOWING OF THE HOLY GHOST INTO A HUMAN BLOOD CELL. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "YOU COULD HAVE TOOK THAT BLOOD cell and put it on a stump and it still would HAVE COME TO LIFE BECAUSE HE WAS BOTH THE EGG AND the life that came into it. It was the blood of God." That today we are not redeemed by the blood of a man. We are redeemed by the blood of God. &gt;&gt; My that ought to be a shouting time in the church of the living God. Amen. What is it? It Amen. We have been brought from the manger TO REALITY. YOU KNOW, IN THE CHURCH TODAY, MANY PEOPLE STILL WANT TO PUT Jesus in a cradle. They want to put the church in A CRADLE. THEY WANT TO PUT US BACK THERE. AND BROTHER BAM SAYS, "But see, we have come out of the cradle. And Pentecost rocked us back under a few years ago, and people throw stones and made fun of us. But we've grown to maturity now. The hour is here. Hallelujah. Do you see what I'm interested to see? God's church coming together. Amen. That we beat out here that the hour is coming when God is throwing a blanket around all of us and drawing us for the enemy is at the gate. He said, watch this now. The great things, Daniel said, in the last days, HE SAID, LAST DAYS will come and there will be great exploits done by the men of faith in that day. DO YOU BELIEVE WE'RE IN THAT DAY? WERE WE IN THE DAY WHEN JESUS is just in a manger or he's in Luther or HE'S IN WESLEY OR HE'S IN PENTECOST? OR HAVE WE REALLY CAME TO AN AGE OF MATURITY WHEN DEITY ITSELF HAS COME DOWN INTO MEN OF FAITH AND IS NOW GIVEN THE POWER TO BRING THE EXPLOITS OF FAITH IN THE CHURCH of the living God? &gt;&gt; My goodness. I don't believe it's God in a manger. But I believe God is alive manifesting himself in the season we're living in in these Christmas times when people are shopping and dancing and drinking and celebrating and know nothing about it like they were celebrating Washington on Lincoln's birthday. He had a sense of humor, didn't he? Amen. They're celebrating Washington on Lincoln's birthday, but they're NOT WORSHIPING. THEY'VE STILL GOT GOD IN THEIR MANGER. BUT WHEN GOD IS NOT IN A MANGER, HE IS RAISED FROM THE DEAD and he is alive forever more. PROVING HIMSELF THE SAME GOD. THAT'S RIGHT. These Nian fathers carried down through the ages. Amen. To Pentecost. That same God that met Paul on the road to Damascus. He was a missionary. He was a messenger to the Gentile. And the Gentiles message started with a pillar of fire and it's going to end the same very way. I believe the hour has come. I believe the season has arrived for the church THAT JOEL THE 2 CHAPTER should be fulfilled. Should it not? Should we still BE IN A MANGER OR SHOULD WE BE WALKING TALL IN THE SCRIPTURES THAT HAS BEEN PROPHESIED FOR OUR GENERATION? BE GLAD THEE, YE CHILDREN OF ZION, AND REJOICE in the Lord your God. For he hath given us the former rain moderately, AND HETH WILL CAUSE TO come down your rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. AND YOUR FLOOR shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm and my great army which I sent among you. Listen that brother Bam said the HOUR HAS COME NOW WHEN THE GREAT DRAMA the picture of God has set forth to the latter rain. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. THAT'S THE SEASON THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. WE'RE LIVING IN THE SEASON IN JOHN WHERE he said, "VERILY, VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU, HE THAT BELIEVETH on me. The works that I DO SHALL HE DO ALSO, AND GREATER WORKS SHALL YOU DO, BECAUSE I GO UNTO THE FATHER." DID HE NOT SAY, "AS MY FATHER SENT ME, SO SEND I YOU." AND HOW DID THE FATHER SEND HIM? HE WENT IN HIM. AND THE SAVIOR THAT SAVED US IS NOT IN A MANGER. HE'S IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. IF HE SENT YOU, HE'S IN YOU TONIGHT. AND HE'S NOT DEAD. HE is alive. AND HE'S JUST AS MUCH GOD TONIGHT AS HE WAS THE DAY HE was born in the manger. But he's in you instead of that manger back there in the Bible. In John 15, he said, "If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you." I believe that's the hour we're living. And man, I think Jesus said these things and brother Bannon will draw from that a great and powerful thing. He said the same power, the same Christ. He said, 'Now you let fundamentalists and people who deny the power of God say it's wrong, but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost. How many got the Holy Ghost tonight? &gt;&gt; I know they started calling Holy Spirit these days cuz they want to they're a bit ashamed of them tongue talkers, you know, of that Pentecostal experience. But brother uses the word Holy Ghost a lot. And I thank God, Amen, that he wasn't so intellectual, he couldn't just read the Bible. Amen. You see what he says? The power of God. Some say it's wrong. He says, "BUT LET THEM PEOPLE DENY THE POWER of God say it's wrong." But the same power that spoke the world into existence is in the people that's got the Holy Ghost. MEN AND WOMEN, IT'S TIME YOU FOUND OUT WHO you are. Now, the devil has been trying to hide you back and tell you you're a little cow down something, but you're not. YOU'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this one? Deity is not in heaven. &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. DEITY IS NOT IN HEAVEN. IT'S IN YOU. AND THEN THE PROPHET GETS A HE GETS A LITTLE FANATICAL AND HOLLERS, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PLEASE BE OUR GOD. THAT DEITY IT'S NOT JUST IN HEAVEN, IT'S IN YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I know you think I'm crazy, but let me tell you something, brother. When you realize the almighty God lives in you with immortal life. My life I give Zoe. The life of God is in a human being. &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT HE SAID. YET A LITTLE while and the world seeth me no more. But you shall see me because I live ye live also. And at that day, now what day is that, folks? &gt;&gt; The day when the revelation is made known. That's this day. &gt;&gt; And at that day you shall know that I am in my father. that ye in me and I in you. At that day you're going to know it. People say, "Well, you can't even know you're born again." Well, Jesus prophesied there was coming a day. &gt;&gt; There would be a DAY OF KNOWING. ISN'T IT ODD that he also re rectifies this with the adoption or maturity or knowing? There is a season of knowing who you are. There is a season of knowing what you're here for. There's a season of knowing what God has done to get you back where you come from. IF I KNOW WHERE I'M AT, IF I knew where I was before and I KNOW I'M HERE TONIGHT, THEN THANK GOD HE REVEALS how to get me BACK WHERE I'M GOING. THIS IS NOT AN AGE OF IGNORANCE. THIS IS AN AGE OF REVELATION AND MATURITY OF THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. YOU CAN CALL IT CHRISTMAS. YOU CAN CALL IT LEARDYSIA. YOU CAN CALL IT ANYTHING YOU WANT. BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF IT, THERE'S A LIGHT THAT SHINES IN A DARKNESS THAT THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST KNOWS WHO SHE IS AND WHERE SHE'S FROM AND WHERE SHE'S GOING. YOU CAN PUT ANY label you want to on this. We are not shaken by labels. &gt;&gt; Well, that bunch of Pentecostals down there. You can label me any WAY YOU WANT TO, BUT I'M GOING TO GET UP IN THE MORNING KNOWING WHO I AM, WHERE I come from, WHERE I'M GOING, WHAT I BELIEVE. I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO NOBODY. WE JUST HAVE to be what God made us to be. &gt;&gt; I love when you get to an age you have to you just don't have to explain yourself no more. You just are who you are. &gt;&gt; Do you see deity of Jesus Christ? Now, Brother Bam says it. That deity is in you. &gt;&gt; Y'all help me preach tonight. Turn and tell somebody said, "Dity is in you." &gt;&gt; Deity is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but you shall be see me. I'll be with you even in the age. You see that? He's using that scripture to say to you, deity is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in the manger. No, Christ in you. Hallelujah. We're not worshiping Christ in a manger, but it's Christ IN YOU, THE HOLY GHOST, THE HOPE OF LIFE, THE HALLELUJAH, THE CREATOR, GOD HIMSELF dwelling in human flesh. My goodness, no wonder Paul says in the Colossians, even the mystery which had been hid from the ages and generations, but is now manifest to his saints, TO WHOM GOD WOULD MAKE KNOWN what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. Christ in you, the hope of glory. That's the great mystery. That's the great hope. Christ is in you, God. Christ, the hope of glory in you, not in a cradle, in you. THAT WAS ONE TIME GOD WAS BACK THERE IN the beginning and he come into Moses and he come into the children of Israel AND HE COME INTO CRADLE BUT NOW THEY'LL WORSHIP HIM BACK THERE LIKE A PREHISTORIC SOMETHING BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S CHRIST IN YOU. HE IS HERE TODAY. &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD IS MOVING UP HIS GREAT CHURCH. COME ON FRIENDS, GET HIM OUT OF THE MANGER AND BRING HIM INTO the age we're living in. A PRESENT REALITY OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. And the prophet of God says this, "When the almond tree shall flourish and the desire of man shall fail," because he goes, he's uh in the book of Ecclesiastes, the 12th chapter, he's talking about as Solomon's talking about at the end of a man's life. Amen. As he's getting ready to fade, he's headed for the long home. The Bible says, "Amen. He's he's he's turned white in the hair. He's headed for the long home. There's certain things that he should have done. He's realizing he's out of time." And brother Bam says, "See, BUT THE PROPHET ALSO SAID IT'LL BE LIGHT in the evening time." AND WE CAN PREACH ABOUT THE Leoa and it's in and the DARKNESS AND THE TROUBLE AND THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING UPON THE EARTH. WE KNOW HER SEASON IS OVER. AMEN. SHE'S COMING TO THE END. BUT THE BIBLE SAID THERE SHALL BE LIGHT IN THE TIME OF DARKNESS. COME ON, CHURCH. YE ARE THAT LIGHT, YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU ARE THAT LIGHT IN THIS GENERATION. YOU'RE NO LONGER DARKNESS. YOU ARE NOW LIGHT. I'M PREACHING PAUL'S SERMON. Paul said, "You are now no more darkness, but ye are light." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I SAY, "TURN ON THE LIGHTS. LET THIS BRIDE RISE UP LIKE SHE'S NEVER BEEN." LET HER CARRY LIGHT INTO EVERY SINGLE PLACE IN THE WORLD WE LIVING IN. YE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. AMEN. DON'T GET UNDER A BUSHEL SOMEWHERE. GOD SET YOU ON A HILL. SHINE LITTLE LIGHTS. SHINE IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS LEISIA. SHINE ON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's the light in the evening time. The path of glory. You will surely find in the evening time has come. The church now that was once dressed like a little manger experience that we've been through has come to the place now where people are realizing the deity and the power of almighty God. God is living in a human being. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; God is living in a human being. &gt;&gt; The hour has come. Brother Brandham said, "The son of God was in a cradle but is in the heart now." He is the deity of God, the creator. Think of this. He was in a cradle, but he's in the heart now. Today, what's the matter with the church? The hope of glory, the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into the people's hearts and they don't recognize what it is. &gt;&gt; They think it's just a little joining of church or something. &gt;&gt; See, but that is God the creator living in you. &gt;&gt; All giving you powers and you're in possession of anything he had. So if you abstain from evil to do good, to shun evil, to flee to righteousness, to turn from temptation, all malad and hatred and strife and so forth, turn away from it. Take him from your heart. See, but if you'll receive him, embrace him, and love him. Now, this is a prophet in your heart. I can tell you the church together in that kind of power HAS THE POWER TO BIND THE HEAVENS, to heal the sick, to open the blinds, to Hallelujah. The deaf's going to speak, and the dumb will speak, and the deaf will hear, and the cripples will walk, and the blind will see. Why? Because they're recognizing the power of God in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Recognizing the power of God that's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Amen. The the the religion is trying to put him IN A MANGER. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PUT HIM IN A CELEBRATION. BUT GOD IS IN YOUR HEART. AND BROTHER B IS SAYING IF WE EVER REALLY RECOGNIZE THE POWER THAT'S IN THE HUMAN HEART, IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT CREATED THE HEAVENS and the earth. Embracing that and believing that. Amen. &gt;&gt; NOW, YOU SEE THAT message that Brother Brandham is bringing is just as unbelievable as the message of the virgin birth was 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; You you you I love Brother Bram's wise. HE PREACHES THE SERMON, WHY IT HAS to be shepherds. &gt;&gt; HE PICKS OUT BEAUTIFUL THINGS that the angels went OVER TO SHEPHERDS. WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE SHEPHERDS? BROTHER BRAM SAID, why didn't he go to the trained and the intellect? Why didn't he go to them that was responsible for knowing these kinds of things? He said because they had been trained in the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAYS IT. HE SAYS BECAUSE basically their training, Amen, would keep them from recognizing who they were talking about. And two. They were trained, but they were trained the wrong way. They were TRADITIONALLY TRAINED. THEY HAD IDEAS OF WHAT IT WOULD BE. SO, BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "SO when the angels gave their message, they didn't give it, Amen, to the theologians. They gave it TO SHEPHERDS. &gt;&gt; NOW, WHY DID THEY GIVE IT TO SHEPHERDS? BROTHER SAID, "SO, because they were unlearned." &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THEY HAD NO religious teachings. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE, AMEN. THEY WASN'T SO HIGH UP. They couldn't receive a message that would take THEM TO A BARN. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. CAN YOU IMAGINE SOME BIG BROTHER SAID HE WAS BORN RIGHT OUT through the shadow of the cathedrals there? He said, "But could you imagine the angels going up there and telling them how upset they had to leave that cathedral and come in a barn to worship him?" Amen. BUT YOU SEE THAT SHEPHERD HAD NO PROBLEM with that barn. HE HAD NO PROBLEM humbling himself to walk into a barn. He was used to going into barns. AMEN. SO GOD SENT THE MESSAGE TO SOMEBODY THAT COULD RECEIVE IT. CAN YOU SEE HOW YOU FIT THAT SHEPHERD IN THE BIBLE THAT WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME TO YOU, AMEN, THAT YOU WOULD READILY RECEIVE? AMEN. WHAT MESSAGE WAS BROUGHT TO THEM? THE MESSIAH IS ON THE EARTH. NOW, THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THEY RECEIVED. THE MESSIAH WAS ON THE EARTH. THINK ABOUT THAT. A MESSIAH IS ON THE EARTH. AND OUR PHARISEES DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THE HIGHUPS DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THE BIG CHURCHES AND THEIR RELIGION DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AMEN. BUT THE ANGELS MADE IT KNOWN UNTO THE LITTLE AMEN. THE LITTLE INSIGNIFICANCE, THE NOBODIES IN A NOBODY PLACE. BUT THEY RECEIVED THE GREATEST message that HAS BEEN EVER HEARD BY MORTAL EARS. THE MESSIAH, THE KING. AMEN. IS ON THE earth now. [screaming] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HE'S ON EARTH NOW. Right now. He's on earth. Can you imagine when they heard that news? But where is he? THE MESSIAH. WHERE IS HE? DOWN the barn. &gt;&gt; Down there among the cows and the and the and and the lambs. And the lamb said, "There's your proof." If it wasn't December, he said they was in a barn, not in a house with with insulation. You know, THEY WAS IN A BARN. AMEN. AND AND AND WHAT NOW WHAT KIND OF ROBE IS HE WRAPPED IN? WHAT kind of what KIND OF NICE FABRIC WOULD WE FIND a king in? OH, HERE'S A SIGN TO YOU. HE'LL be wrapped in a swaddling cloth. [laughter] GLORY TO GOD. HERE'S A SIGN. WHEN YOU FIND THE MESSIAH I'M TALKING ABOUT, HE'LL BE WRAPPED IN SO MUCH HUMILITY THAT YOU WON'T EVEN WANT TO RECEIVE THAT IT'S THE TRUTH. BUT IT'LL BE THE TRUTH ANYHOW. THE MESSAGE IS THE TRUTH WHETHER WE BELIEVE THE TRUTH OR NOT. THE MESSIAH IS ON THE EARTH. BUT IT'S WRAPPED IN A SWADDLING THAT YOU WON'T EVEN WANT TO RECEIVE IT. &gt;&gt; It's just a shepherd now. &gt;&gt; It was just shepherds. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and take take that type of shepherd for just a moment. Receiving that message. What was it? Amen. The message I'm quoting him directly. The Messiah is here now. And it bypassed all the trained ones to come to them humble ones, people that would receive it. &gt;&gt; The people wouldn't say, "Oh, well, wait a minute, Brother Bam. You're wrong on that." &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. No, wait a minute, Angel. You're wrong on that. Couldn't be the Messiah's here now cuz we ain't got no place for him. See, there's no there's no places big enough and there's no there's we don't have enough pump and we don't we don't have it. We don't have things set up, you know, you know, BECAUSE WHEN HE COMES, he's going to come this way and everything. you know, the Pharisees are going to have it. He's going to come riding in on the horse and he'll be the &gt;&gt; BUT THIS MESSAGE WAS A tradition shattering message. &gt;&gt; IT SHATTERED IT, BUT IT was a word message. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, IF IT IF IT IS THE MESSIAH WHEN HE'S BORN on the earth, isn't it amazing? Brother said that king was born and nobody even knew it, &gt;&gt; but heaven knew it. &gt;&gt; And brother said, watch. He said the angels came down and began to sing. And when the angels began to sing, he said, "Angels have not sang to mortals." He said, "Ever there has never had be until that time angels on the earth singing to mortals." He said, "THE ANGELS HAD sung up in heaven when God created and took it to Job the 38th chapter and said, "Where were you WHEN THE MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER AND THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY?" THEY SAID, "THERE THE ANGELS SANG. THEY SANG AT THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH." HE SAID, "BUT NOW THERE WAS GOD IMMORTAL COMING INTO MORTAL EARTH AND THERE WAS NO CHOIRS TO SING FOR HIM. THERE WAS NOBODY. THERE WAS NO GREAT TRAINED VOICES TO SING FOR HIM. CAN YOU IMAGINE Joseph running down to the to the to the to the choir down at the cathedral downtown. Uh listen guys, we'd like y'all to come and and and and sing for the entrance of the great king." Oh yeah. Who is he? He's Jesus. Uh he's Jesus. And uh and who's his father? Well, that's kind of a that's kind of a story, but but he's the king. See, he's the king of peace. Would you COME DOWN AND SING FOR HIM? OKAY. WHAT WHAT HALL IS IT THAT WE'RE going to be in? What palace has he been born in? Oh, no. He's in the barn down here. &gt;&gt; Amen. WHAT KIND OF SOUND SYSTEM? WELL, SORRY to tell you, it won't be peevey. Amen. It's not going to be bows. Matter of fact, you ain't going to have none. &gt;&gt; AND Y'ALL JUST COME DOWN, gather around a little bit, and you don't have to practice. HE SAID, "KING, JUST COME SING a little while." AMEN. YOU CAN YOU IMAGINE them trying to convince a great robed choir to come to a barn to sing among the lambs and the animals. AMEN. WITH A POOR FAMILY WITH A LITTLE BABY WRAPPED IN A IN A SWADDLING CLOTH SETTING THERE. CAN YOU IMAGINE? BUT MAN SAID NO. HE SAID THEY WOULDN'T HAVE COME. THAT'S WHY GOD SENT ANGELS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? AMEN. Mortals man didn't even know he was born. But heaven knew how something HAD HAPPENED. SO HEAVEN BE TO SING. AND HEAVEN SANG IN THE PRESENCE OF MORTAL BEINGS BECAUSE SOMETHING HAD TRANSPIRED. OH, church of the living God. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT RECORDINGS TODAY in the message of Christ is the mystery of God revealed ABOUT 2:00. AMEN. They're singing, "Take the name of Jesus with you." And brother Bam said, "There it is." He said, "The hand just struck 2:00. THE SECOND PULL IS OVER. THE THIRD PULL IS AT HAND." DID YOU HEAR THE ANGELS? THEY PICKED IT UP AN OCTAVE. All right, y'all want TO PREACH A LITTLE WHILE? AN OCTAVE IS EIGHT NOTES. AMEN. WE'RE BACK TO THE EIGHTH DAY AGAIN. THE FIRST DAY IS ALL OVER AGAIN. THE SAME GOD THAT STARTED IT. IT'S THE SAME GOD THAT'S GOING TO FINISH IT. THIS AIN'T ANOTHER CHURCH. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL CREATION. GOD HIMSELF HAS TOLD US SOMETHING HAS BEEN BORN. THE BAPTISTS DIDN'T KNOW THERE HAD BEEN A BIRTH. THE LUTHERANS DIDN'T KNOW THERE HAD BEEN A BIRTH. BUT THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN HAD ANNOUNCED IT IN A CLOUD OUT WEST. AND NOW THEY WERE SINGING to mortal beings, "The king has been born, but he's been born in another manger." &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. WITH THAT IN MIND, I COULD SAY, "MERRY CHRISTMAS TO THE BRIDE." AMEN. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A MANGER IN A BARN, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR HEART. AMEN. THEY THINK YOU AIN'T NOTHING BUT A BARN. THEY THINK YOU AIN'T NOTHING BUT AN ILLEGITIMATE BUNCH. BUT LET ME [laughter] TELL YOU, THE HEAVENS OF HEAVENS HAS CHOSE YOU TO BE THE DWELLING PLACE OF THE MIGHTY GOD IN THIS GENERATION. &gt;&gt; WELL, SOMEBODY SHOUT HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. [panting] They wouldn't have want that bunch over there. They wouldn't have wanted them in that cathedral anyhow, &gt;&gt; right? them angels probably made more noise than they would have wanted to hear. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Do you see what it is? The Messiah Messiah was on the earth. Do you know that when brother Bam spoke of the Israel returning to their homeland that there was people over there and they interviewed them and they said, "What are you coming home for? What's what's the purpose in y'all's homecoming?" And and and everybody else has a reason Israel's returning, you know. But they ask Israel, "Why are you returning?" They said, "We're returning to see the Messiah." &gt;&gt; Do you know they're going to get the same message you got? &gt;&gt; Do you know there won't be another opening of the seven seal? How many knows that &gt;&gt; there won't be another opening of the book? &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHEN THIS GOES TO ISRAEL, it'll be just like Ruth handing a BABY TO NOA. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID IT DIDN'T. SAID RUTH HANDED A baby to Naomi and HER YOUTH WAS REFRESHED AND SHE GAVE LIFE TO THE YOUNG BABY. WHEN THIS GOSPEL GOES BACK TO ISRAEL, IT'LL GO BACK ALIVE. WE'RE NOT HANDING A DEAD BABY BACK TO ISRAEL. WE'RE HANDING THE WORD BACK TO ISRAEL. AND WE WILL REVIVE NAOMI. HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A REVIVAL IN THE BRIDE. AND THIS REVIVAL GOES BACK TO ISRAEL. WHAT IS THE REVIVAL? IT'S NOT JESUS IN HISTORY. IT'S JESUS IN YOU. &gt;&gt; THE LIVING REALITY OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. WHAT A MESSAGE. WHAT A MESSAGE WE'RE LIVING IN. &gt;&gt; I told some of the brothers the other day, I said, "Sometimes I hear preachers, they well, I ain't got nothing to preach and I don't feel important." And I listen, it ain't got nothing to do with us feeling important. But let me tell you this. We got a message and it's the message of the king. If you're preaching your ideas, I get it. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HUNT UP SOMETHING TO SAY, I GET IT. BUT IF YOU'RE PREACHING THIS MESSAGE, YOU TELL EVERY DEVIL IN HELL TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. I HAVE BEEN CALLED. I HAVE BEEN ANOINTED. AND WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY IS THE MESSAGE OF THE KING. THIS IS THE RESURRECTED JESUS CHRIST AND HAS COME INTO THIS AGE TO AWAKEN THIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Glory be to God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, well, you think Brother Brown's the Messiah? Nope. He said it wasn't me. I'm not the Messiah. But the Messiah is talking through me. &gt;&gt; He says it's not some man here, the Messiah. It's the Holy Spirit is the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he's here now working in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. getting the body ready for rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "See, I'm not the Messiah." He'd act the same way he did when he was on the earth. That's right. He'd do the same thing that when you know when he was on the earth as the Messiah. I'm not the Messiah. And no other man is the Messiah. I'm glad he went ahead and put that out there. And no other man is Messiah. He is Messiah. &gt;&gt; But his spirit dwells in us. &gt;&gt; The Messiah, not me. I'm a man. It's his spirit. The same anointing you feel. That's the same spirit that's here talking. This is just a gift. &gt;&gt; Look at what he tells us. THE SAME MESSIAH. OH, I could say this morning that the same Messiah in the form of the Holy Ghost is here right now. You talk about a message, FRIENDS. THE MESSIAH STILL LIVES. HE LIVES TONIGHT. HE'S NOT DEAD. HE'S ALIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF IF BROTHER BRANDHAM COULD ASK WHY SHEPHERDS, I COULD ASK WHY YOU &gt;&gt; IF HE COULD ASK WHY SHEPHERDS. THE SAME ANSWER HE GAVE FOR WHY SHEPHERDS, THAT'S WHY YOU. AMEN. ALL OF THE DISQUALIFICATIONS THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT to yourself. I'm uneducated. I'M UNKNOWING. I'M NOT A BIBLE STUDENT. I'M NOT A SCHOLAR. I SAY THANKS BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THANKS BE TO GOD. CUZ YOU WOULD HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO unlearn before you could learn. &gt;&gt; Moses had TO GO TO THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT 40 YEARS BEFORE GOD COULD EVER USE HIM. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU KNOW. I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU KNOW. I SAID WE OUGHT TO FORGET WHAT WE KNOW SO GOD COULD USE US IN THE WAY HE WANTS TO USE US. &gt;&gt; WELL, brother Wayne, when you come to the message, you didn't know nothing. I didn't. &gt;&gt; And I really don't steal that feel that I do. But everything that I do know, I got from a prophet. &gt;&gt; So if you got a problem with what I say, you got a problem what he taught. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD CALLED OUT, WE'LL receive the sign. And that was the sign of the Messiah. It's the sign of Messiah is among us. See, brother Brandham was announcing he is here. &gt;&gt; You see that? WE ARE MESSIAHS, BUT THE NOT WE are not messiahs, but the Messiah lives in us, which means the anointed one. He's got to anoint us all. Do you see? He's born. Now, now many times we look into this and we say, "Well, Amen. Why shepherds?" Well, that's simple. Shepherds wasn't trained and they wouldn't turn down the message when it came to them. Shepherds would easily believed what God sent angels to tell them. &gt;&gt; And you believed what God sent a seventh angel to tell you. &gt;&gt; And you believed it. You received it. You recognized it. And you preach it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, that same one that said why shepherds also said, "Why Bethlehem?" &gt;&gt; Ain't that awesome? Why Bethlehem? Bethlehem wasn't a big place, was it? Y'all y'all ever study Bethlehem? Bethlehem when the prophets when when Joshua was dividing the land, he put Bethlehem and Judah. Made no mention of it. It was so big he made no mention of Bethlehem, but it was in the tribe of Judah. But we find out that when the prophecy came forth, remember he said, "Oh, oh thou Bethlehem littlest among them all." And and God makes prophecy which shows you was in his mind, but it was so small nobody thought about it. But it wasn't thought about until that gentile Rahab founded it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's really beautiful when you see Amen. Brother Bam teaching there in why Bethlehem and he said you remember Rahab that gentile when she escaped there from Jericho. She married a general of the army of Israel and they moved to Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's what made Bethlehem what it was. And it become the bread and from Bethlehem that's where Boaz come forth. That's where Ruth come forth. That's where all of those those was born in that same city in Bethlehem. And brother said, "So it was known as the bread center of Israel." And isn't it odd that David was born there AND THE SON OF DAVID, Jesus was born there. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says, "And today," HE SAID, "THAT'S WHERE EVERY SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD IS BORN is they're born in Bethlehem." &gt;&gt; Don't you love it? Born in Bethlehem. Every one of you IS BORN IN THE SAME PLACE. YOU'RE BORN IN CHRIST. THAT'S WHY IT HAD to be because you're born in Christ. Do you SEE WHAT IT IS? GOD TAKES NOBODIES IN A NOBODY PLACE. AMEN. AND MAKES A PLACE FOR HIS MESSIAH to come upon the earth in their bodies. Maybe small and unknown, but don't say unimportant. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; MAYBE SMALL AND UNKNOWN, BUT DON'T SAY UNIMPORTANT. BECAUSE BY IMPORTANCE, your election was from before the foundation of the world, chosen to be what you are tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you this, brother Bam says in a super sign, that's the message. That's the message this Christmas. The evening lights, the signs of the Messiah accompanying it. Accompanying the message. The evening lights are here. Brother Bam says, "Now, now think of the the terms that Brother Brandham is preaching and super sign." And he's talking about the sign of of a virgin shall conceive from Isaiah 7. And now he's going to turn and say, "This is my Christmas message to you. The evening lights are here." &gt;&gt; See, now he's preaching a Christmas message. His Christmas message is to you. The evening lights are here. That's the message that the angels have sent to the shepherds. The evening light is here. Look in the rise of the sun. I I love this one in uh 1965. Amen. How many ever heard that sermon, the rise of the sun? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's an Easter sermon, right? And in the Easter sermon, Brother Bam calls it quickening power. That's what he's talking about. And he BEGINS TO SAY THAT THE CHURCH has to be dynamics and mechanics, BOTH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED THEM TO DO THINGS THAT they did. And it hit on 16 cylinders. Why 16? Mark 16. It hit on 16 cylinders. And so will the bride. For he said in John 14:12 that he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. I give him a charge of my dynamics in their mechanics. In other words, their word is going to get a charge of the spirit and the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again in the last day. That's the Easter message. Oh, the same prophet that gave us a Christmas message gave us an Easter message. &gt;&gt; The Christmas message, the evening lights are here. The Easter message, the dynamics and the mechanics are together. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; MY EASTER MESSAGE TO YOU is the word and THE MESSIAH HAVE NOW BECOME ONE. THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE WORD OF GOD ARE NOW TOGETHER. THIS IS THE EASTER MESSAGE. I LIVE, BUT NOT ONLY I LIVE, YE LIVE ALSO. WE'RE NOT JUST A WORD CHURCH. WE ARE A WORD THAT IS ALIVE CHURCH. WE ARE THE LIVING MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD THAT WAS WRITTEN IN THIS DAY. WE DON'T JUST GOT A CADILLAC, BROTHER. WE GOT GAS AND FIRE IN THAT CADILLAC. &gt;&gt; You know, you know what brother Ram said? He said, "You can have the best Cadillac in the world." He said, "You can fill it up with gas and everything, but if you ain't got no spark, you ain't going nowhere." &gt;&gt; Is that right? IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO SPARK, YOU AIN'T GOT NO. BUT IF YOU GOT SPARK AND you got you got a little water in the gas, it'll just sputter. And brother SAID, "SEE, IF IT'S PURE GOSPEL AND YOU PUT THE FIRE on it, IT OUGHT TO EXPLODE. THERE OUGHT TO BE A MOVEMENT IN IT. BUT IF YOU TAKE THE GOSPEL AND YOU ADD A little with it, you know, I don't believe in that kind of thing, and I don't believe we ought to act like that, and I don't think we ought to do this, and I don't think if you add a little of that, THEN WHEN THE FIRE BEGINS to fall, it just sputters. &gt;&gt; Every preacher sitting in here knows what I'm talking about." AND YOU BEGIN TO PREACH the the POWER OF THIS MESSAGE AND YOU GET IN A CHURCH WHERE THERE'S some dynamics in it and you begin to LAY THAT MESSAGE OUT, THERE'S A FIRE THAT'LL DROP DOWN ON THAT. PEOPLE BEGIN TO REJOICE AND SOME STAND AND SOME SHOUT AND PEOPLE BEGIN TO SAY, "WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THEM PEOPLE?" IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S REAL GASOLINE AND THERE'S REAL FIRE. AMEN. AND SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL, AMEN. WELL, GOLLY." AMEN. WELL, WE DON'T REALLY DO IT LIKE THAT. AMEN. BUT I SAY LIKE THIS. If you want it, get some real gasoline and get some real fire. AND YOU, IT DON'T MATTER IF YOUR CAR IS MADE IN CANADA. IT DON'T MATTER IF YOUR CAR IS MADE IN AFRICA. I DON'T CARE IF THAT CAR IS MADE IN SOUTH AMERICA. YOU IT YOU DON'T MATTER WHERE THE CAR COMES FROM. IF IT'S GASOLINE AND IT'S FIRE, IT'LL STILL RUN, BROTHER. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. COME ON. I DON'T CARE IF YOUR CHURCH IS IN THIS STATE OR ANOTHER COUNTRY. YOU PUT THIS MESSAGE WITH THE FIRE OF GOD AND IT'LL MOVE THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR REVIVAL. WE ARE THE REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT CHRISTMAS TONIGHT. [applause] &gt;&gt; The mechanics without the dynamics won't do you no good. Brother Wayne, we believe the message and without the spirit on it, it will do you no. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having the greatest message on the planet &gt;&gt; and it be no good? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having the spirit of God moving among you but not have no word for it to fire on? &gt;&gt; One without the other is no good. Right. &gt;&gt; See, watch. You got a Christmas message. You got an Easter message. And And if you're a reader, it sound like it's the same thing. [laughter] It sounds like his Christmas message. And his Easter message is the same thing. &gt;&gt; The Eden lights are here. That's the Christmas message. &gt;&gt; Christ is in you, the manger. &gt;&gt; And then he turns around and says, "My Easter message is the spirit is on the mechanics &gt;&gt; in invisible union of the bride. He preaches a Thanksgiving message. &gt;&gt; He was covering all the holidays, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; And thanksgiving, he says, "My thanksgiving message is the invisible union of the bride in Christ." &gt;&gt; That's the THANKSGIVING MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN an invisible union &gt;&gt; of the bride in Christ. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING? THERE'S BEEN A MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; The spirit HAS COME INTO THE FLESH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Y'all's Bible readers, how many ever read 2 Thessalonians 2 &gt;&gt; and you get to reading that there'll be a gathering unto him and then there's going to be a great falling away. You read about it and the Bible says now speaking of the tribulation and he said he that will let will let till he be taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says watch. He said there's two he there. &gt;&gt; There's he God and he the church. &gt;&gt; Well the church ain't a he, is it? But brother BRANDON SAYS, "BUT SEE ME IN SECOND THESSALONIANS there has been a marriage. SO THE BRIDE NOW IS NOT CALLED A SHE. SHE'S CALLED A HE." &gt;&gt; SO HE WILL let until he, the bride, BE TAKEN OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A UNION. SHE IS NOW MISS JESUS CHRIST. SHE IS IDENTIFIED. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS IN THE SEVENTH SEAL, SHE IS &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE BROUGHT HIM to the earth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The invisible union of the bride of Christ. My thanksgiving message to you little bride. You never done it &gt;&gt; in the first place. Amen. See, receiving a thanksgiving message. And as we receive this Thanksgiving message, Brother Bam says that I I love how he does things. In 1965, this is this is in the invisible union. This is the Thanksgiving message. He says, "I pray God that the new life will come into them. And I pray Lord for across this nation around this world where this tape will be played that they will also receive this thanksgiving message. And I know by the hints and things that's been thrown in what they must do. I pray father you grant it to them. You mean brother Brandon was throwing in hints? So what kind of hints was he putting in there brother Wayne? This is the kind of hints he was saying. The bride must separate from everything. Remember scripture in Romans 7, a woman can't remarry as long as she has a living husband. &gt;&gt; And the living husband is your first birth. &gt;&gt; How many knows that? &gt;&gt; That's why there's a denominational system because people are born of their first birth. And their first birth leans to denominationalism. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says, you know who your lover is? Is when the word says to do something and you don't want to do it, then you love the first husband rather than him. &gt;&gt; But he says you can separate from the first union by death. You can die to yourself and separate from whatever birth and come into a new land or a new life through Christ Jesus. We're not looking for something outwardly, BUT WE'RE YIELDING OURSELVES to the revealed word which brings separation from unbelief and an invisible union takes place in the heart. &gt;&gt; See, it's a union. Amen. Now, here's another one. Brother Bram says in wise shepherds I'm going to introduce my Christmas message as I'm closing now. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; What a Christmas message. &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Isn't it odd that his sermons on Christmas always get around to a present tense God living in the form of the bride? &gt;&gt; Amen. because that was what his Christmas message was about. That's what his message is about. &gt;&gt; And sir, as we would see Jesus, brother Ram said, Christ himself pointed the people to his death. [snorts] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus never pointed people to his birth. &gt;&gt; He pointed them to his death. &gt;&gt; Look, if you're if you're a Bible reader in John 12, the Greeks come and said, "Sers, would we see Jesus?" And Jesus never pointed them back to the manger to see him. HE SAYS, "IF A CORN OF wheat does not go into the ground and die, it abideth alone." &gt;&gt; Now, what a parable to people that want to see Jesus. He pointed to his death, his burial, AND HIS RESURRECTION, &gt;&gt; KNOWING the Gentiles would never see him until after he resurrected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Are we Are we together on that? See, he didn't point to a birth. &gt;&gt; He pointed to a death. &gt;&gt; And brother Bon says, "See, your life and his life find each other not at the church or in a building or in a creed or in good works, but in the cross." &gt;&gt; YOU FIND HIM IN THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU are crucified with him, that's where you find Christ. YOU DON'T FIND HIM BY DOING BETTER. &gt;&gt; OH, WELL, Brother Wayne, you know, I I I'd like to get I'd like to get I'd like to get closer to the Lord. I'm going to start doing better. &gt;&gt; That ain't the way you find him. &gt;&gt; You don't find him by turning a new page or starting a new life. &gt;&gt; You don't find Christ like that. &gt;&gt; You find Christ only in death. &gt;&gt; Not in a manger, not in a confession, not in creeds or fables. YOU DON'T FIND CHRIST THERE. A TRUE servant can take you to him. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Who did they go to? Well, Tim, when them men, when them Greeks in the Bible, now I've not left my subject. When them men wanted to see Jesus, who' they go to? They went to the disciples, did they not? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "Today, men who want to see Christ goes to his servants." &gt;&gt; And if it's a true servant, he can show you Christ today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you say, "Well, brother Brandham, if Christ is on earth today, a real servant would take him to him." &gt;&gt; Well, Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the form of the word. Do you see what he did? &gt;&gt; He just took you to him. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're a theologian, the message could never take you to him &gt;&gt; because you're going to go look for him in something else because you ain't going to believe that. But if you're but if you're of that shepherd nature, if you're of the one he talked about in the scripture, &gt;&gt; when a prophet said he's in the word, when you go to the word, you know that's him. &gt;&gt; The word brings life because he is the word. Christ is the word. He is the word himself. And a true servant always takes you to the word. &gt;&gt; Now, he is the word. He is the Bible made living. And when you die to yourself with Christ like a corn of wheat, then the word lives in you. Do you see? YOU SAY, "WELL, I WANT TO SEE JESUS." He said, "Not to a a cradle." He pointed THEM TO A CROSS. BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO SEE HIM, YOU HAVE TO DIE to yourself and let the word begin to be manifest in you. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE CHRIST IN A MANGER. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE CHRIST IN YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Brother man said, "Then that word lives in you and it'll BRING THE SAME RESULTS AS IT did back there." Now, he's the word. God, you say, "Brother Wayne, who is the word or who is Jesus?" Brother Bam said, "He is the word with the true interpretation." &gt;&gt; The true interpretation of the Bible. How many knows the Messiah has the interpretation? Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus opened the book and he closed it, he said this day this scripture is &gt;&gt; and brother B said nobody but the Messiah had the interpretation of that scripture. &gt;&gt; And the same Messiah that interpreted the scripture in that place is the one interpreting scripture today. &gt;&gt; The bride has the true interpretation of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you look out here in Leoa and you read how the scripture says that they're miserable, blind, wretched, naked, the leotans have the interpretation of that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That don't belong to us. We're not making that live. &gt;&gt; But the bride has the interpretation of that true bride church. He has that interpretation. And if God is using you to interpret his own word, Christ is the living interpretation of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my s we would see Jesus 1961. Now I'm going to close by saying this in these few words. My Christmas message is let me point you tonight to the cross &gt;&gt; and you the corn of wheat fall into Christ and die there. &gt;&gt; There you will find his life in his word being the same yesterday, today and forever. Let that be my Christmas message to you. I ain't pointing you to a manger or to a cradle or to a church or a denomination. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I could preach right there. &gt;&gt; I've had so many people uh ministers travel across the planet preaching their church, &gt;&gt; preaching their pastor, preaching their ideas. &gt;&gt; We need to preach Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray to God that we're raising men up out of this church that don't go out and say that that to go out and preach True Word Tabernacle is the answer. &gt;&gt; I pray that they preach Christ as the answer. &gt;&gt; I ain't pointing you to a manger or to a cradle or to a church or a denomination. People say, "Sir, we would see Jesus." I'll point you to them. He points to his death, burial, and resurrection. And let your corner of wheat fall in there. Let his word become real in you and you'll see he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you see? He wasn't pointing to a birth. He was pointing to a cross. &gt;&gt; And when you crucify yourself and you die and you're resurrected, your eyes can then see the word of the age. As long as you got an idea of what he is, the the real the real reality can't live in you because you won't receive what he is. But when you die to your own thought and you die to your own belief and mindset and you let him come in, he'll open your eyes. Now, and why it had to be shepherds, brother Brandham is he's such a powerful preacher and he lays some powerful things down. And I was listening to this the other evening and brother Brandham says, "Oh," he says, "Brother Brandom, an angel that gave them that message, they found it exactly the way the angel said it would be and in the place where the angel said it would be." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When those shepherds ran from that angel's message, the scripture said they ran down and they found it the way it had been told them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you see? Do you see tonight &gt;&gt; we've heard the message &gt;&gt; that the Messiah is in you? &gt;&gt; Have you died out enough to see it's true? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you died out to your to to to your own person to see it's true? Have you died out from that? Oh, I'm nobody and I could never be nobody and I ARE YOU GOING TO DIE out to that to see it's true? People say, "WELL, DEITY IS only in heaven. ARE YOU GOING TO DIE TO that to see the message is true?" &gt;&gt; CHRIST is in you. Brother Bam says it like this and super sign. Oh, today pilgrim brother, my sister, believe the sign. Look into the manger of your own heart. &gt;&gt; And see if you are able to say within yourself the sign that the shepherds sing. God in the flesh is dwelling amongst the poor AND THE NEEDY AND THE OFFCAST. SEE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT God is in your heart. God is here. &gt;&gt; See if you can look IN YOUR OWN HEART AND SEE THE MESSAGE IS TRUE. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; This isn't just a this isn't just a story. Amen. This gift of Christ in you, it cost God something. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham threatened to preach a sermon called the on the street. &gt;&gt; How many ever How many ever say it? He said, "I I I think I'll preach a sermon called the on the street." Well, he didn't. He preached a God's uh provided gifts or something that along that title. But then he told the story in the end of it, and he tells a story about a about an old man in New York City that had a wife and a and a baby girl, a young girl, and he tells about they were really poor. How many ever hear it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh four or five of you, then y'all help me along. And and brother Bham tells a story about that and he says the old fell couldn't afford he said a good doll or anything. He said matter of fact they couldn't afford nothing. So the sickness come on the mother and he said he really couldn't even afford the doctor bills and the mother had died long about Christmas season &gt;&gt; and said and then the baby itself was sick and said daddy I I just want a doll for Christmas. and said the old fella didn't have the money, so he was saving along trying to get it. And brother Justin, you know, he'd saved up good money, the best he could. And brother said he didn't have much and it wasn't much he needed, but he got all he could get to get it. And he said he went down on Christmas night and bought the doll. He said it was real cold in New York City and blizzards blowing in and things. He said people in the city was all rush and everything. Nobody even knew really what was happening. And he said he went over there and he and he bought that doll and he said he got to walking around the street with that doll. And he said he got to stumbling around a little bit and he said a policeman stopped him in the middle of this of this alley and he said to him said, "Sir, what are you doing?" He said, "Well," he said, "I bought this doll." And he said, "I'm going to take it to my to my daughter." Now, that daughter had died a few days before Christmas. And but this old man was so taken with the idea that his that his baby girl had never had a doll for Christmas. So he bought that dome, was walking around on Christmas night looking for his daughter. And brother Bam said them policeman, he said they thought he was drunk. He said, Brother Bam said he wasn't drunk. He said the old fella was so far gone in his I'm going to get this baby. I'm going to get this doll to my baby girl. I'm going I bought the I bought the doll for you. Last thing she wanted was a doll. I bought the doll for you. And brother Bam said he went off into the night in just like a a stereo, you know, didn't kind of out of his head. Didn't know what he was doing. when the next morning they found him, snow blowed over him and he he had froze to death in the in the street that night looking for his doll for his baby girl. And brother Bam said when the policeman he said went over it was the same policeman had sent him the night before. He said, "Oh, I know who that man is." And they rolled him over and he had that doll and he had that doll tucked up under his heart. And the old policeman said, "Well, I guess he took his doll to his daughter." And brother Bam said, "Do you see there was no way &gt;&gt; to get the gift of that doll to the daughter without dying himself &gt;&gt; because she had been out of reach?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "And the gift that God has promised the church, &gt;&gt; he could never get to us without a death." So he took upon himself the cross &gt;&gt; and there he brought the gift of the spirit &gt;&gt; and gave it to the church. Amen. I wonder tonight if our musicians could come. &gt;&gt; He brought to us a gift that only he could die for. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I want to receive his gift. I want to receive the gift that God has sent into this age. &gt;&gt; Can you look in that heart tonight and see what the messenger said was there? &gt;&gt; That little song we had mentioned, Ben, we could just play that. We stand tonight together. why it had to be shepherds. Brother Bam said, "I offer myself to God tonight with all of my heart and all that's in me." I wonder tonight if you could feel that same way. If Brother Brandham could do that, I imagine we could. I want to offer tonight. I want to offer myself to God tonight with all my heart, with all that's within me. I don't have very much to give. I can't bring a frankincense or a myrr or gold cuz I don't have any. But all I have is in myself that God gave me [music] his life. And I dedicated Aresh tonight. &gt;&gt; I dedicated Aresh tonight. Oh, dear God. What can I do? Help me from my shepherds. Help me and these other shepherds, Lord, around the [music] world. Shepherds of the word to proclaim it in this next year. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Give us thy love and thy spirit. Lord, as we dedicate ourselves tonight to thy word and to thy call, I wonder tonight, I wonder if you might want to do that. You want to dedicate your life. Maybe you're here tonight. You're visiting in this place and you've never gave your life to Jesus Christ. I wonder tonight maybe you [music] would like to say, "Brother Wayne, I'd like to surrender to him. I'd like to surrender [music] my life. I'd like to give my life to him." God bless you, honey. [music] God bless you. Maybe just by the uplifting hand, you'd say it right now. Brother Wayne, remember me in prayer now. I'd like to as you [music] stand here tonight.

I found myself saying to the Lord God, I want to I want to dedicate myself a new tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to a new tonight, Lord.

Won't you right here tonight consecrate? Say, Lord, I want to consecrate. I want to dedicate to you while we do this right now. Maybe maybe you want to step out of your chair and come up here around the altar tonight. You you [clears throat] just say, "I want to make a sign. And I I I want a sign before heaven that I'm going to consecrate my heart a new tonight. Your heart's full of the Holy Ghost. You know that. But you just want to consecrate a new tonight.
