[1:02:45] Christ
[1:02:47] hey man this is not about a church this

[1:03:15] dark world Amen and found seed of God
[1:03:17] that was laying in this earth and has
[1:03:19] quickened us to life that's what the
[1:03:21] message is it's quickening power brother
[1:03:22] sister it's not a Creed it's not the
[1:03:25] church that you belong to it's not the
[1:03:27] lifestyle that you were raised in amen
[1:03:29] it's the power of God Amen which has
[1:03:31] been spoken into this age to bring Sons
[1:03:34] and Daughters of God to manifestation
[1:03:36] amen it was sent to call you out amen
[1:03:38] with everything that we do with all of
[1:03:40] our effort we want to lift up the
[1:03:42] message of Jesus Christ amen to walk in
[1:03:44] this evening light and give God all the
[1:03:46] preeminence that he deserves and see
[1:03:49] this bride amen come into the fullness
[1:03:51] of the blessing that she has prophesied
[1:03:53] to receive
[1:03:55] amen we that's what we're trying to
[1:03:57] build friends amen we're not trying to
[1:03:59] build a church here we want you to take
[1:04:00] these Revival fires home to your church
[1:04:02] we want to build the message
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:06] Pride built up by an end time evangelism
[1:04:09] brother Graham said we're trying to
[1:04:10] light these fires we know that the
[1:04:12] nation has rejected its Revival amen we
[1:04:15] know that this generation amen will not
[1:04:17] receive a Revival there will never be a
[1:04:18] great Revival sent down on our country
[1:04:21] on this world on its religious systems

[1:04:29] Revival fires on every Hill that we can

[1:04:47] well brother Nathan what we need to do
[1:04:49] we need to get our young people to
[1:04:50] Christ and then show them the message
[1:04:54] that's not how we believe it friends if
[1:04:56] that's what you believe you've missed
[1:04:57] the whole thing amen because this
[1:04:59] message is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ
[1:05:03] is still speaking and moving amongst his
[1:05:05] people today he's still revealing his
[1:05:08] deity through a bodice body Ministry
[1:05:10] today but what he wants to do is get a
[1:05:13] group of young people a new generation
[1:05:15] amen that he can draw them unto himself
[1:05:17] and take his deity and pour it into
[1:05:19] young men and young women and reveal the
[1:05:22] mystery that was in him before the
[1:05:24] foundation of the world which mystery
[1:05:26] you are young people for there's only
[1:05:28] one form of eternal life and that was
[1:05:29] you before
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:32] hey man you were Sons and Daughters of
[1:05:34] God before there was a moon
[1:05:36] stars or a molecule
[1:05:39] Hallelujah what a blessed message
[1:05:42] amen that's what this is about friends
[1:05:44] this is not wildfire
[1:05:46] this is not strange fire but there is a
[1:05:49] pillar of fire that is moving amongst
[1:05:51] the Bride of Jesus Christ it's thus
[1:05:53] saith the Lord the move is on for the
[1:05:55] bride amen and the pillar of fire has
[1:05:57] been here this weekend and has met some
[1:05:59] young people on the sacred Sands with a
[1:06:02] voice that could speak from a burning
[1:06:03] bush
[1:06:04] amen and speak right right to where
[1:06:07] you're at friends
[1:06:08] speak right to your heart he's spoken in
[1:06:11] our sessions with the older youth amen
[1:06:13] the the the the inspiration that that
[1:06:15] brother Samuel and brother Aaron had it
[1:06:16] dovetailed so beautifully together we
[1:06:18] could not have we could not have
[1:06:19] coordinated had we tried amen I want you
[1:06:22] to believe young people that God is
[1:06:24] speaking to you this weekend
[1:06:25] and I want you to believe that he's
[1:06:27] going to do it one more time
[1:06:30] amen you remember last year
[1:06:32] when chains were breaking
[1:06:35] brother Timothy had left the platform
[1:06:37] he was already on his way out that side
[1:06:39] door but there was one heart there was
[1:06:43] one young lady sitting in this
[1:06:44] congregation still Bound by complexes
[1:06:47] still Bound by fear amen and it was one
[1:06:49] young lady's desire amen that that that
[1:06:52] sent the hand of the Lord and pulled
[1:06:54] brother Timothy out of that office to
[1:06:55] tell you that you are beautifully
[1:06:57] and wonderfully made amen this message
[1:07:00] friends is a living breathing thing this
[1:07:04] is not a dead letter this is not a Creed
[1:07:07] amen it's a living
[1:07:09] reality
[1:07:11] living reality it speaks
[1:07:14] amen what good is a we talk about well
[1:07:17] we've got the word we've got the word
[1:07:18] but brother Bram said if you if you had
[1:07:20] a sword of the word and and if you you
[1:07:24] could just strike and strike and strike
[1:07:25] if that sword didn't have something to
[1:07:27] to cut the Veil
[1:07:29] amen if the word doesn't cut the veil if
[1:07:31] it doesn't reveal Christ if it doesn't
[1:07:33] make him a living reality to you then
[1:07:35] it's no good
[1:07:37] but he said the word
[1:07:39] in an ordained hand
[1:07:42] he said that word when it comes into an
[1:07:44] ordained hand that it'll be a sword
[1:07:47] that'll rip the Veil
[1:07:49] so brother Timothy as we invite you and
[1:07:51] appreciate you this morning there's only
[1:07:53] one thing left to say
[1:07:56] let a rip
[1:07:58] [Applause]

[1:13:38] amen
[1:13:42] amen yeah yeah
[1:13:47] the prophet of God has said it like this
[1:13:48] he said God's strategy is to take empty
[1:13:51] vessels
[1:13:52] empty-human vessels and shake the world
[1:13:56] with them like at Pentecost at Pentecost
[1:14:00] what did he do he took 10 days to get
[1:14:02] all emptied out but they was all
[1:14:04] standing there with their vessels turned
[1:14:06] up and God took himself and filled them
[1:14:09] up that's all and they shook the world
[1:14:13] and that's the need of today amen I you
[1:14:16] know I'm not interested in you just
[1:14:18] shaking the world in the sense of Europe
[1:14:21] or or the world economies and world
[1:14:24] powers and all that but I'm excited I'm
[1:14:26] expecting you to go home and Shake Your
[1:14:29] World

[1:14:33] live in your bedroom your car your
[1:14:35] places that you live amen amen amen I
[1:14:39] believe that you're going to go home
[1:14:40] with a with a power that is not your
[1:14:42] power but it's his power because it's
[1:14:45] not our lives that can do these things
[1:14:47] it's not our lives that can cast out
[1:14:49] Devils it's not our lives that can live
[1:14:51] above sin but it's his power amen living
[1:14:54] on the inside of us therefore when we
[1:14:56] receive power from Christ and in our
[1:14:59] lives come the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:15:01] that's what God did this weekend amen I
[1:15:03] believe that you came with complexes and
[1:15:06] you came with fears and and you came
[1:15:08] with anxieties and you came with all
[1:15:09] kinds of issues in your life but God
[1:15:12] sent us big old bulldozer down and he
[1:15:15] cut all those things to pieces and he
[1:15:17] just put them off on the scrap pile
[1:15:19] somewhere and in your life he's built a
[1:15:21] Hallelujah Avenue
[1:15:23] amen it ain't the same place no more the
[1:15:25] Holy Spirit has brooded over you this
[1:15:28] weekend to now big beautiful flowers of
[1:15:31] Salvation are standing up you don't have
[1:15:33] to try to impersonate anything it's a
[1:15:35] new heart that's come inside of you it's
[1:15:37] a new spirit that's come inside of you
[1:15:39] everything is new he says how the dev
[1:15:43] how can the devil walk back there and
[1:15:45] expect those same old things there again
[1:15:47] that same old fussing that same old
[1:15:50] Fighting those same old complex
[1:15:51] everything that you had in you but when
[1:15:54] he walks back he finds that God has took
[1:15:57] a bulldozer and he has run everything
[1:16:00] out and he's turned the whole ground
[1:16:02] upside down he's built Big Terraces put
[1:16:06] a beautiful home there and he himself
[1:16:08] has moved on the inside of you he said
[1:16:11] oh I feel religious right now the Holy
[1:16:14] Spirit has come and he turned over your
[1:16:17] Tin Can Alley and he dumped it upside
[1:16:19] down and he swept out all that stuff and
[1:16:22] inside of there he creates a new heart
[1:16:25] he creates a new life not only that but
[1:16:28] he moves in to see that from now on
[1:16:31] everything's going to go all right amen
[1:16:34] glory to God he is the caretakers he has
[1:16:36] caretakers that is assigned to you amen
[1:16:39] listen you're not going to go home and
[1:16:40] have to worry about all this by yourself
[1:16:42] no he is assigned angels on your behalf
[1:16:45] he's assigned angels to follow buses
[1:16:47] home he's assigned angels to get in cars
[1:16:51] amen when you go home you're gonna find
[1:16:53] Angels that's around your room and
[1:16:55] moving in your life because they're
[1:16:57] caretakers of his property and his
[1:17:00] angels going to be there when the Devil
[1:17:01] comes back and he says no you move back
[1:17:03] this ain't your place no more this ain't
[1:17:06] your dwelling place no more you used to
[1:17:08] live here but you don't live here no
[1:17:10] more you used to come in here but you
[1:17:12] don't come in here no more you used to
[1:17:14] abide here though but you don't abide
[1:17:16] here no more amen God has come and
[1:17:19] listen listen don't don't get the idea
[1:17:21] that when you're gonna go home that
[1:17:23] Satan's going to just kind of roll back
[1:17:24] and and take it easy on you know he's
[1:17:26] going to continue to try to come he's
[1:17:29] going to continue to try to hit you but
[1:17:31] if that Eternal question has been
[1:17:34] settled in your heart amen there's not a
[1:17:36] devil in hell that can shake you from it
[1:17:40] Hallelujah listen young people you're
[1:17:42] gonna go home to trials you're going to
[1:17:44] go home to situations you're going to
[1:17:46] have mind battles is still going to come
[1:17:48] but if that Eternal question has been
[1:17:51] settled on the inside you can point him
[1:17:53] right back to where that steak was
[1:17:55] driven and say devil right there I
[1:17:58] changed right there I once was but I'm
[1:18:01] no more that man right there I used to
[1:18:03] be this but I know more of that I used
[1:18:06] to be covered up with fear I used to be
[1:18:08] covered up with complexes but that's not
[1:18:10] me no more I'm a blood ball son or
[1:18:13] daughter of the king okay
[1:18:17] Hallelujah
[1:18:19] he's going to try to make you believe
[1:18:21] nothing happened he's going to try to
[1:18:23] make you believe it wasn't a real
[1:18:25] experience because you're still having
[1:18:27] battles
[1:18:30] no God gave you an experience so you can
[1:18:33] win
[1:18:36] hey man you come in here whipped but
[1:18:39] you're going out equipped
[1:18:41] amen you're going out with something on
[1:18:44] the inside of you and when that Devil
[1:18:46] Comes against you next time he gonna say
[1:18:48] whoa wait a minute
[1:18:53] see Satan is a master of minimizing the
[1:18:57] word and maximizing excuses
[1:19:01] amen see you know the word's been
[1:19:03] preached to you and the Bible says it is
[1:19:05] her brother Jonathan preach on it he
[1:19:07] sent his word and healed you read it in
[1:19:09] Psalms he sent his word listen that is
[1:19:11] what has delivered you
[1:19:16] amen it wasn't you know we get to one we
[1:19:18] get to wanting these certain things to
[1:19:20] happen you know wait a minute I'm gonna
[1:19:22] get ahead of myself
[1:19:23] he will minimize the Vindication of the
[1:19:26] word and bring forth to the front for
[1:19:29] Forefront every excuse imaginable and
[1:19:32] make them bigger than the Vindicated
[1:19:34] word of God
[1:19:37] the worst part of making excuses isn't
[1:19:40] altogether the missed opportunities it
[1:19:42] isn't the guilt that you might feel amen
[1:19:45] after you lied to yourself it's not the
[1:19:47] money you might lose or the
[1:19:48] relationships that might end or the
[1:19:50] Broken Dreams you never fulfill the
[1:19:52] worst part about an excuse the hidden
[1:19:55] danger is that you'll eventually start
[1:19:57] believing them
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:01] eventually your excuse will become the
[1:20:04] truth no matter how much God speaks to
[1:20:07] you through the word of God
[1:20:10] the longer you make excuses the more you
[1:20:13] actually start to believe them and
[1:20:15] you'll no longer cringe when you say it
[1:20:17] because it's become the truth
[1:20:19] listen to this right here in John 5 you
[1:20:21] know there was a man that was at the
[1:20:22] pool of Bethesda he'd been laying there
[1:20:24] 38 years there was a certain man been
[1:20:27] ill for 38 years and when Jesus noticed
[1:20:30] him laying there helpless knowing he had
[1:20:32] been in that condition a long time
[1:20:35] he knew how long that man had been there
[1:20:37] he knew how bad it was he knew how
[1:20:40] impossible it seemed and he asked the
[1:20:42] question
[1:20:43] do you want to get healed
[1:20:50] do you want to get healed do you want to
[1:20:53] get to I'm going somewhere do you want
[1:20:56] to get to every day that no doubt this
[1:20:58] man wished for healing he wished for
[1:21:00] deliverance he wanted it he desired it
[1:21:02] he thought but Jesus comes and he goes
[1:21:05] right to the real root of the problem do
[1:21:08] you want to get healed
[1:21:12] amen what do you want to get well
[1:21:16] seems like a terrible question to ask
[1:21:18] somebody in that condition that God had
[1:21:20] been paralyzed for 38 years he had
[1:21:22] missed out on Joyce for a long time that
[1:21:25] we take for granted and Jesus had the
[1:21:27] nerve to ask this question do you want
[1:21:30] to get healed this question makes no
[1:21:33] sense until this man starts making
[1:21:35] excuses
[1:21:38] [Applause]
[1:21:40] well I wanted a certain preacher to pray
[1:21:42] for me
[1:21:47] to me directly it's a way that to a
[1:21:49] preacher that I know it was him listen
[1:21:51] this is his word
[1:21:57] you don't need really a preacher to tell
[1:21:59] you by his stripes you're healed because
[1:22:02] it's in his word
[1:22:06] you don't need her amen some certain
[1:22:08] thing to happen if it's in his word
[1:22:12] but the problem the devil wants to make
[1:22:14] you have an excuse why you're still
[1:22:16] living the Way You Are
[1:22:18] some of you still bound this morning
[1:22:20] because of your excuses you came to a
[1:22:23] prayer line with excuses
[1:22:25] [Applause]
[1:22:27] my brother Andrew didn't say this or
[1:22:28] brother Wayne didn't do this or I didn't
[1:22:30] get this happen listen let's do away
[1:22:32] with excuses this morning

[1:22:54] no one has picked me up and and took me
[1:22:57] to the pool
[1:22:58] before I get there somebody's already
[1:23:00] beat me

[1:23:10] shouting the victory it's gonna be all
[1:23:11] right
[1:23:13] do you really want to get well see Satan
[1:23:16] had maximized the excuses and minimize
[1:23:19] the word
[1:23:22] do you want to get well or do you want
[1:23:25] to continue to identify with excuses
[1:23:31] do you want to get well or do you want
[1:23:33] to continue to believe the lies you told
[1:23:36] yourself

[1:23:50] else to happen and it didn't do you want

[1:23:58] excuses instead of the word of God they
[1:24:01] begin to lift up their excuse of why
[1:24:03] something didn't happen and why this
[1:24:05] listen you need to turn your thoughts to
[1:24:07] the word of God the word said I could

[1:34:01] amen hallelujah
[1:34:05] Moses slipped off them shoes and started
[1:34:08] walking up that was the angel of the
[1:34:09] Lord Jesus Christ sitting in that bush
[1:34:11] the pillar of fire that led the children
[1:34:13] of Israel he said any teacher knows that
[1:34:15] the angel of Covenant was Jesus Christ
[1:34:17] he was the rock that was in the
[1:34:18] wilderness he was the brass serpent he
[1:34:20] was all in all the Patriarchs he was in
[1:34:22] David he was down through the New
[1:34:23] Testament and he's in his church tonight
[1:34:27] the same Lord Jesus yesterday today and
[1:34:30] forever and he changes not
[1:34:32] oh he didn't like excuses then and he
[1:34:36] don't like him now
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:44] God told Moses
[1:34:47] he said well Moses but I I can't say
[1:34:50] much I don't have good speech you know I
[1:34:53] used to have that same excuse I said I
[1:34:55] don't want to be a preacher I hate being
[1:34:56] in front of crowds
[1:35:01] give a book report in school I just
[1:35:04] shook me to my
[1:35:09] but the devil devil knows how to pull
[1:35:11] those excuses over your eyes
[1:35:18] people say brother Ronnie was saying on
[1:35:21] the way here he said man you are hey you
[1:35:22] always so calm
[1:35:24] it's kind of like a duck
[1:35:27] sitting on the water he just gliding
[1:35:29] across but underneath he kicking like
[1:35:30] all get out
[1:35:34] good
[1:35:41] yeah
[1:35:44] when God determines anything you're
[1:35:46] going to do it anyhow
[1:35:50] I'm going to say that one more time
[1:35:52] because I went
[1:35:53] hit the back wall if God is determined
[1:35:56] to do anything you're going to do it
[1:35:58] anyhow
[1:36:04] God has his way set and you're going to
[1:36:07] do it so you might as well give in and
[1:36:10] start to work that's all
[1:36:16] so he showed him signs he he put his
[1:36:18] hand in leprosy put it back in a clean
[1:36:20] he throwed a rot down snake to pick the
[1:36:22] back up
[1:36:24] and it goes down
[1:36:25] that
[1:36:27] as we was talking about the first night
[1:36:29] that light made such a change in that
[1:36:31] man's heart and that man's life brother
[1:36:34] Brandon said you talking about something
[1:36:36] ridiculous he said let me come across
[1:36:39] let me look across let's look come
[1:36:41] across the hill one beautiful morning
[1:36:43] the sun's Rising the birds whistling all
[1:36:46] of a sudden steps out an old man about
[1:36:47] 80 years old whiskers flying everywhere
[1:36:50] white hair bushing bushing behind him
[1:36:52] leading the old mule with a wife sitting
[1:36:54] a straddle with a young and on each hip
[1:36:56] crooked hand and stick in his hand here
[1:36:58] he goes where are you going Moses I'm
[1:37:00] going down to my bedroom to take over
[1:37:05] there
[1:37:10] I'm going down to my house and I'm going
[1:37:13] to take over hey there's a lot of enemy
[1:37:16] over there don't matter God said go take
[1:37:18] over he said you mean you're going to
[1:37:20] take over I sure am why because God said
[1:37:23] so
[1:37:27] sure we're going to take over that's all
[1:37:29] God said it and if God said it that
[1:37:32] settles it
[1:37:36] write this down if God said so you can
[1:37:40] do it
[1:37:44] if God said so you can do it it doesn't
[1:37:48] matter what the devil tries to stop you
[1:37:50] or how many Devils tried to arise in
[1:37:52] your path if God said so you can do it
[1:37:58] well that's ridiculous
[1:38:02] you got what you got in there we've got
[1:38:04] a nuclear weapons you got what you got I
[1:38:06] got a stick

[1:38:37] this is how I fight my battles
[1:38:42] this is how I fight my battles
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:47] I don't fight it because some preacher
[1:38:49] said something
[1:38:51] I fight it because God said it
[1:38:58] God said you can live above fear
[1:39:01] God said you can live above pornography
[1:39:04] said you can go home and take over
[1:39:09] God said you can go home and drive that
[1:39:12] enemy out of your life
[1:39:15] because when a preacher ain't there when
[1:39:18] the church ain't there when Mom and
[1:39:19] Daddy ain't there
[1:39:20] God is still there he's still on the

[1:54:44] don't forget who he is
[1:54:47] he's not to be a stranger he's to be
[1:54:49] your daddy

[1:54:57] here and disturb unless you know see a
[1:54:59] deacon blah blah blah all that I never
[1:55:00] really read it never
[1:55:05] I that's how it wasn't for me
[1:55:10] because behind that door was my daddy
[1:55:15] some of you come to God a whole lot
[1:55:17] different you come begging and begging
[1:55:19] I'd have to beg my dad
[1:55:22] if I truly had a need he supplied my
[1:55:24] need
[1:55:27] you don't have to come to God begging
[1:55:28] and begging this and begging that don't
[1:55:30] become a bunch of spiritual beggars

[1:56:06] in all his ways
[1:56:11] yeah yeah like a wave of sea that's
[1:56:14] blown and tossed men should not think
[1:56:17] that he receive anything because he's
[1:56:18] double-minded

[1:59:04] who said went to the South to the
[1:59:06] synagogue on the Sabbath as was his
[1:59:08] custom

[1:59:12] church so his children does too
[1:59:16] oh yeah anyhow and but when he got there
[1:59:18] he didn't just sit there with his arms
[1:59:20] folded
[1:59:21] he walked in John 2 and he saw the
[1:59:24] temple was full of oxen and sheep and
[1:59:26] doves lukewarmness
[1:59:31] formalism
[1:59:34] full of psychology
[1:59:37] and he made what he do he made him a
[1:59:38] scourge of small cords
[1:59:41] he just wove a few things together and
[1:59:43] he drove them out of the temple the
[1:59:45] sheep and The Oxen and he poured out the
[1:59:47] changer's money and he overthrew the
[1:59:49] tables and said unto them that sold
[1:59:52] doves take these things hence and make
[1:59:55] not my father's house a house of
[1:59:57] merchandise and his disciples remembered
[1:59:59] that it was written the Zeal of thine
[2:00:02] house has eaten me up

[2:00:09] kingdom upside down

[2:00:16] sit there or some lukewarmness to sit
[2:00:19] there or some
[2:00:21] he didn't allow it to stay there he
[2:00:23] grabbed some promises and he wove them

[2:05:49] Ministry if you don't mind you all know
[2:05:51] this gift in my life is Supernatural as
[2:05:53] a gift where uh whereby the holy spirit
[2:05:55] is able to discern diseases and thoughts
[2:05:58] of men's heart either hidden things that
[2:06:00] only God can know and then reveal to me
[2:06:02] is I wish you could stand with me and
[2:06:04] see the faces of people
[2:06:07] I saw him last night but Wayne you saw
[2:06:10] him last night the faces brother Andrew
[2:06:12] you saw him last night the faces many of
[2:06:14] you Brothers the faces of people
[2:06:17] when Satan knew no he's going to be
[2:06:20] exposed
[2:06:24] now it isn't the people I'm talking
[2:06:26] about it's this devil Satan has got a
[2:06:29] hold of their lives through sin listen
[2:06:31] to this indifference
[2:06:36] disease
[2:06:38] you should see their faces Satan knows
[2:06:41] he's going to be exposed oh my
[2:06:47] all that hollering you heard last night
[2:06:49] all them Devils just fighting they knew
[2:06:52] they were about to lose
[2:06:55] any time you see a devil start acting
[2:06:58] out it knows it's about to come out
[2:07:04] let me just drop something in right
[2:07:05] there many times we see in a prayer line
[2:07:07] or somewhere wherever a devil start
[2:07:09] acting out don't be afraid
[2:07:11] that's not the time to fear
[2:07:15] that's the time to believe
[2:07:17] and I give you that little head right
[2:07:18] there because when he starts doing that
[2:07:20] he knows his time is over
[2:07:25] he knows he's finished he knows this
[2:07:29] vessel I'm about to lose
[2:07:33] cause I've met somebody greater than I
[2:07:36] am
[2:07:36] [Applause]
[2:07:45] Satan is afraid
[2:07:49] the white direct quote he knows the
[2:07:52] spirit of God is about to let people
[2:07:54] know of his works that is why he hates
[2:07:58] these meetings so much
[2:08:00] what names are called and diseases
[2:08:02] revealed Satan hates it
[2:08:09] listen we're in the time of the the the
[2:08:12] throning of Satan
[2:08:17] when spirit of God comes into a Believer
[2:08:19] there's a commission
[2:08:21] cast that devil out
[2:08:25] if you don't believe the commission
[2:08:26] you're not a child of God
[2:08:30] after receiving the commission he gives
[2:08:32] the power to use it casting out the hold
[2:08:35] on man's life that's crippled him
[2:08:38] for years
[2:08:41] some of y'all came here crippled
[2:08:43] in your spirits for years

[2:09:45] out with a high hand go across he said
[2:09:47] it wasn't but a few more moments in
[2:09:49] church this church trouble started
[2:09:50] coming
[2:09:54] it wasn't only a few moments later When
[2:09:56] Trials came and the church got All Shook

[2:10:05] way it was supposed to be

[2:11:21] going to be rejoicing and shouting and
[2:11:24] dancing down the streets no they're
[2:11:25] gonna be times of testing

[2:14:33] because they don't have no more dominion
[2:14:35] over me
[2:14:38] [Music]
[2:14:44] it's time to drag their old bodies
[2:14:50] I remember old David when he went down
[2:14:52] there into Goliath I didn't go through
[2:14:53] it but when he gets down in there and he
[2:14:55] cuts that glass head off he didn't just
[2:14:58] leave it laying there he drugged that
[2:14:59] dude around
[2:15:03] he drug it all the way to a Crossroads
[2:15:06] and he hung it on a spear that
[2:15:09] crossroads of the main intersection a
[2:15:11] main highway I stood there I looked at
[2:15:13] it it was a Main Place he hung it for
[2:15:15] all Israel to see your Goliath is dead
[2:15:25] there was a son of David come walking by
[2:15:27] one day with an Old Rugged Cross and do
[2:15:31] you know he came to that same spot and
[2:15:33] he put that cross in the ground and he
[2:15:36] took death up to that same place so all
[2:15:39] the world could see death has no
[2:15:42] dominion over you
[2:15:46] well if death has no Dominion
[2:15:48] pornography has no demand
[2:15:55] you know there's Chiefs of the tribes of
[2:15:58] demons we heard Brothers talk about it
[2:15:59] when that Maniac come up and he was he
[2:16:01] was cast out or he was you know the man
[2:16:03] fell over brother Brown's and he said is
