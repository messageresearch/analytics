[1:03:07] was his Kinsmen through Naomi
[1:03:10] and when he got done with his testimony
[1:03:12] the Bible tells us that he he he would
[1:03:16] have received a worthiness from the
[1:03:18] elders would have spoke back and said
[1:03:20] you fulfilled the law
[1:03:22] and when you read the book of
[1:03:23] Revelations and you find that our lord
[1:03:25] Jesus stood up as our Kinsmen
[1:03:27] and when he proved that he was kin to
[1:03:29] you and I and he said these are my
[1:03:32] Kinfolk he was testifying the Bible said
[1:03:35] to 24 Elders that was 12 New Testament
[1:03:38] and 12 Old Testament and when he got
[1:03:40] done with his testimony these men who
[1:03:42] knew the law who knew the requirement of
[1:03:45] the Kinsmen they took off their crowns
[1:03:47] and they throwed them on the ground and
[1:03:48] said Worthy
[1:03:50] he's worthy he's worthy of our of our
[1:03:53] kinsmanship tonight
[1:03:56] I'd still believe he's worthy
[1:04:00] I still believe he's worthy the prophet
[1:04:03] of God said this is the time of King
[1:04:05] lamb worship it's when the book has been
[1:04:08] opened up and the redeemed and all the
[1:04:10] Earth began to worship our lord for what
[1:04:12] he's done for us you know friends we are
[1:04:15] setting in one of the greatest seats in
[1:04:17] the history of time
[1:04:19] brother mental there's been a lot of
[1:04:20] people whose names in the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:22] Life but this is the first generation
[1:04:24] that have known their names as in the
[1:04:26] Lamb's Book of Life in the ministry of
[1:04:29] this age has the benefit of preaching to
[1:04:31] people who they know is in the Lamb's
[1:04:34] Book of Life and will appear into Glory
[1:04:36] I tell you it's the most powerful time
[1:04:38] to preach the gospel it's the most
[1:04:40] powerful time to worship Christ it's a
[1:04:43] season like no other has ever been you
[1:04:46] know you you have literally been put
[1:04:48] here in this time in this age to stand
[1:04:52] perfectly sinless and to worship God as
[1:04:55] a person who has no sin at all before
[1:04:59] almighty God friends I tell you we we
[1:05:01] should give worship like we never have
[1:05:04] we should honor him in the power of his
[1:05:06] blood like it's never been
[1:05:09] you know uh being being a little bit of
[1:05:12] a hillbilly and simple growing up we uh
[1:05:15] we just you know uh we work for some
[1:05:17] engineers and things later in our lives
[1:05:19] and I worked as an inspector for a time
[1:05:21] over a city and the city engineer I
[1:05:24] worked just under one and then there's a
[1:05:26] engineer over the whole area in the
[1:05:28] mayor and and I was working in there and
[1:05:31] one day a bunch of them had a little
[1:05:32] problem on one of the road jobs and they
[1:05:34] didn't like something on the cross and
[1:05:36] so the mayor and the city engineer got
[1:05:37] together and they invited me to lunch
[1:05:39] and they kind of bypassed my personal
[1:05:42] boss that one just over me and I went to
[1:05:45] lunch with them all and I seen what they
[1:05:46] were doing brother Ray the minute I saw
[1:05:48] it I said look folks you all have to
[1:05:50] talk to my boss I'm out of here I'm not
[1:05:52] I don't want nothing to do with this all
[1:05:53] right this is going to get me in a lot
[1:05:54] of trouble so I went that evening and
[1:05:57] and was going to leave my office and and
[1:05:59] the engineer just over me he called me
[1:06:01] he said blank I see your minutes I won
[1:06:03] his office sister Barbies very angry at
[1:06:05] me and he starts saying you you went
[1:06:08] around me and you've talked to the mayor
[1:06:09] and you've did this and you did this and
[1:06:11] when I was listening to him I knew I
[1:06:13] didn't
[1:06:14] So I listened to him and when he got
[1:06:15] done I said sir I didn't do that my
[1:06:18] apologies I know it could look like that
[1:06:19] I did but I'm not guilty at all of doing
[1:06:21] that and he said well I don't want to
[1:06:24] investigate it and I'll see you tomorrow
[1:06:25] I said oh well then please do you know
[1:06:27] investigate it so tomorrow afternoon he
[1:06:29] called me in the office and he looked
[1:06:31] right at me and brother Mike he said to
[1:06:33] me he said Dwayne he said I've
[1:06:35] investigated this he said and you've
[1:06:37] been exonerated

[1:06:51] saying so I just stopped him and I said
[1:06:53] sir forgive me but what does exonerated
[1:06:55] mean anyhow

[1:07:04] had just been accused of something but
[1:07:05] really I had never done it in the first
[1:07:08] place

[1:07:11] exonerated in this age and we've had a
[1:07:14] prophet to say that God has put you to a

[1:14:31] that work with them thank you for that

[1:14:56] what we're doing and just believing God
[1:14:58] every day
[1:15:00] addicting medicines to kind of help me
[1:15:02] give me a better quality of life and so
[1:15:05] amen I enjoy my grandbabies too much

[1:15:14] amen maybe you just look over at your
[1:15:16] neighbor and say brother Ron loves you
[1:15:26] brother on that's awkward well I may not
[1:15:29] be able to tell you personally but
[1:15:33] I want you to know that with all my
[1:15:35] heart
[1:15:35] I mean that with all my heart
[1:15:40] well I thought they were going to sing
[1:15:42] my sermon and preach it as well with
[1:15:44] brother Wayne
[1:15:45] and so I was just going to go out the
[1:15:47] back door and say have at it
[1:15:52] to speak to you to you a little while on
[1:15:54] he sent his seat into the Earth
[1:15:58] right if you will turn with me to
[1:16:02] Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 1.
[1:16:06] it's a very powerful scripture
[1:16:10] and sometimes we read scriptures
[1:16:13] and we just kind of go across it but we
[1:16:15] don't realize the power
[1:16:18] every word is a
[1:16:21] and every seed has the life within
[1:16:24] itself to reproduce itself and it's got
[1:16:27] power within that seed word that's why
[1:16:30] you as a group of people are so powerful
[1:16:34] you're operating as an amateur God on
[1:16:36] the Earth
[1:16:38] here you are in laodicea
[1:16:41] in Sodom condition
[1:16:43] the darkest age that there is and you're
[1:16:46] in the bride's Revival
[1:16:50] not looking to it you're enjoying it
[1:16:54] well one day one day we'll realize that
[1:16:57] that day's here
[1:16:59] and we're not looking for it anymore
[1:17:01] we're enjoying it
[1:17:03] and it's going to give you a body change
[1:17:10] because it has the power within itself
[1:17:12] to do it
[1:17:15] no longer a quote no longer just a good
[1:17:18] thought
[1:17:20] but Sarah changed
[1:17:22] and so did Abraham
[1:17:25] amen God bless you and that same Mighty
[1:17:28] angel came to tell you
[1:17:31] yeah you're getting ready to get a
[1:17:32] mighty change
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:36] amen Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 1.
[1:17:40] think about what it would be like
[1:17:43] for the Lord Jesus to borrow a boat to
[1:17:46] preach to us tonight
[1:17:48] and the same day went Jesus out of the
[1:17:51] house
[1:17:52] and set by the seaside
[1:17:55] and great multitudes were gathered
[1:17:57] together unto him
[1:17:58] so that he went into a ship and and sat
[1:18:02] and the whole multitude stood on the
[1:18:04] shore
[1:18:06] and he spake many things unto them in
[1:18:08] Parables saying behold A sower went
[1:18:11] forth to sow
[1:18:13] and when he sowed some seeds fell by the
[1:18:17] wayside
[1:18:18] and the fowls of the air came and
[1:18:21] devoured them all
[1:18:23] and some
[1:18:25] fell upon Stony places where they had
[1:18:28] not much Earth for with they sprung up
[1:18:32] because they had no deepness of the
[1:18:35] Earth
[1:18:37] and when the sun was up they were
[1:18:39] scorched
[1:18:40] and because they had no
[1:18:42] they withered away
[1:18:44] and some fell among thorns and the
[1:18:48] Thorns sprung up and choked them
[1:18:50] but others fell into good ground
[1:18:54] and brought forth fruit
[1:18:56] some a hundredfold
[1:18:58] some 64 some 34.
[1:19:02] who have ears to hear Let Him hear
[1:19:06] and the disciples came and said unto
[1:19:09] them why speaketh thou unto them in
[1:19:12] perilous and he answered and said unto
[1:19:15] them because it is given unto you to
[1:19:18] know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
[1:19:20] but to them it is not given
[1:19:23] for whosoever hath to him it shall be
[1:19:26] given and he hath more abundance
[1:19:30] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:19:34] taken away evens at the path therefore
[1:19:37] speaking to them in Parables because
[1:19:41] seeing they see not and hearing they
[1:19:44] hear not neither do they understand
[1:19:47] and in them
[1:19:49] is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah
[1:19:53] which saying by hearing you shall hear
[1:19:57] and shall not understand
[1:20:00] and see and you shall see and shall not
[1:20:03] perceive
[1:20:05] for this people's heart is wax gross and
[1:20:09] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[1:20:11] eyes they have closed lest at any time
[1:20:14] that they should see with their eyes and
[1:20:16] hear with their ears and shouldn't and
[1:20:19] should understand with their heart and
[1:20:21] should be converted
[1:20:23] and I shall build them
[1:20:25] what a powerful word and I shall build
[1:20:27] them
[1:20:28] and blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:20:31] and your ears for they hear
[1:20:34] for barely I say unto you that many
[1:20:37] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:20:41] to see those things which you see and
[1:20:45] have not seen them and to hear those
[1:20:47] things which you hear and have not heard
[1:20:50] them yet
[1:20:52] shall we have church
[1:20:55] may God bless the reading of his word
[1:20:57] and you exceeded
[1:21:04] Hallelujah
[1:21:07] now Paul would be one that would not
[1:21:11] be there in his Earthly Ministry
[1:21:15] but he would be one that would meet him
[1:21:17] in a pillar of fire form
[1:21:20] many of us never sat personally to hear
[1:21:24] the prophet of God
[1:21:26] but when we heard that voice behind The
[1:21:30] Voice
[1:21:34] brother random story became more than a
[1:21:36] story
[1:21:38] a caribou became more than a caribou
[1:21:42] squirrels became more than just
[1:21:44] squirrels
[1:21:45] and we kind of set like that little lady
[1:21:49] Hattie that said that's absolutely the
[1:21:52] truth brother Brown
[1:21:56] and something on the inside of you
[1:21:58] responded
[1:22:00] and you knew that you had looked for
[1:22:02] something maybe all of your life and
[1:22:04] you'd heard a lot of voices
[1:22:07] but when you heard this voice
[1:22:12] it don't take 10 years or five years
[1:22:15] it's just a moment it just changes your
[1:22:17] life
[1:22:18] maybe a friend sitting beside of you
[1:22:20] they they don't catch anything
[1:22:23] but something on the inside of you it
[1:22:25] just it just moves you
[1:22:29] and Jesus is taking his time on the boat
[1:22:33] and as he's taken his time he knows who
[1:22:36] he's speaking to
[1:22:38] because he's so sore
[1:22:41] and he knows he sent them in the Earth
[1:22:43] for a certain time in a certain age
[1:22:46] because we realize that you're born
[1:22:48] never a sign and
[1:22:50] and sometimes would get so antsy about a
[1:22:52] child coming to the Earth that's you
[1:22:55] know will it come today will it come on
[1:22:56] my birthday will it come on our
[1:22:58] anniversary will it be convenient when
[1:23:00] it comes it comes exactly what God wants
[1:23:02] it to come
[1:23:05] because he's got to be born under a
[1:23:07] certain birth pattern
[1:23:08] and God was like a great contractor
[1:23:12] when he was laying out the Earth and he
[1:23:15] laid out the potassium and the potassium
[1:23:18] and all the chemicals of your body he
[1:23:20] knew where even your mother would eat
[1:23:23] your body out of the Earth
[1:23:26] now God was very attentive to your DNA
[1:23:32] because you're going to Temple
[1:23:34] eternal life inside of that
[1:23:37] now your your flesh he wanted it to have
[1:23:40] a certain characteristic certain color
[1:23:42] of hair and a certain eye color to be a
[1:23:46] certain build and
[1:23:50] he'd have some of you skinny and some of
[1:23:52] you fluffy
[1:23:59] God don't get nervous about none of that
[1:24:03] you know we don't pattern after
[1:24:04] Hollywood if God made us wonderfully
[1:24:07] made and
[1:24:08] and as a matter of fact even your spirit
[1:24:10] down to your fathers God watched over
[1:24:13] and protected that seed all the way down
[1:24:16] Wars and turmoils and coming to America
[1:24:20] in the bottom of a ship he watched over
[1:24:23] that
[1:24:24] he crossed bombs not to go off because a
[1:24:27] certain man was carrying your natural
[1:24:29] seed
[1:24:31] in a very simple little sermon brother
[1:24:33] Brown calls it one in a million
[1:24:37] and what you don't realize that 999 999
[1:24:42] died
[1:24:44] needing no funeral but you were
[1:24:47] predestinated to life
[1:24:51] and if he could watch over your natural
[1:24:53] seed that much
[1:24:55] in his great pre-planet
[1:24:59] being the sower of his seed on the Earth
[1:25:06] knowing what messenger you would be
[1:25:08] under
[1:25:10] the influence of that messenger and what
[1:25:13] you would do with it
[1:25:17] I want you just think in another realm
[1:25:19] there was another enemy that was
[1:25:21] watching
[1:25:23] now he's always been in the Border
[1:25:28] he's always been about abortion there's
[1:25:30] a real reason for it he's trying to kill
[1:25:31] God's seed
[1:25:33] because that seed is eternal and he's
[1:25:36] trying to poison it he's trying to deter
[1:25:38] it
[1:25:40] he killed literally incredible
[1:25:43] Generations trying to get Moses
[1:25:47] and and We Know by the prophet God has a
[1:25:49] sense of humor he just allowed him to be
[1:25:52] put in a basket
[1:25:54] dispatched Angels even Gabriel to stand
[1:25:57] on the on the little basket and let him
[1:26:00] go down a crocodile infested water
[1:26:03] and as you go down that water he said
[1:26:06] when the crocodiles come up
[1:26:08] just put your foot on
[1:26:11] now you couldn't see that realm but God
[1:26:14] had tens of thousands of angels to watch
[1:26:17] over Moses the natural seed
[1:26:21] you're not alone
[1:26:24] you're never alone you'll never be alone
[1:26:28] when you feel that you're loneliest
[1:26:30] God's got dispatched angels to watch
[1:26:33] over you you're better protected than
[1:26:36] the president of the United States of
[1:26:38] America
[1:26:47] amen now remember
[1:26:50] you're as Eternal as Jesus is
[1:26:55] what our Prophet told us
[1:26:57] that seed is eternal as he is
[1:27:00] so he took a photo album and put it
[1:27:03] together of you at your best
[1:27:07] no not 18 years old or 21 years old
[1:27:11] but before the foundation of the world
[1:27:16] amen I find it so interesting that
[1:27:19] brother Branham would talk about
[1:27:20] Michelangelo
[1:27:22] Beethoven and Shakespeare
[1:27:26] because he had been in contact or in
[1:27:29] Fellowship
[1:27:30] with the greatest architect that there's
[1:27:33] ever been
[1:27:39] and you know when you can realize that
[1:27:41] God has architect your life
[1:27:48] don't let your situations around you
[1:27:51] overwhelm you you were built to live
[1:27:54] here
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:27:59] you've all recorded it but I'm gonna
[1:28:01] quote it
[1:28:02] the hour is here
[1:28:06] if I could have been back there before
[1:28:08] the days of the world was created
[1:28:11] and looked down and sing the whole thing
[1:28:14] and the father had said to me
[1:28:17] what day would you want to live
[1:28:21] I would say it right now
[1:28:26] right now
[1:28:28] this is the hour
[1:28:31] this is the greatest power that the
[1:28:33] church has ever moved into
[1:28:37] just before the coming of the Lord
[1:28:43] quite powerful isn't it
[1:28:45] Paul being a
[1:28:48] powerful messenger
[1:28:51] and maybe we didn't hear his sermons
[1:28:54] so we had the great luxury of having
[1:28:56] some of his quotes written down
[1:29:00] so I want to read you a couple of these
[1:29:01] quotes is that okay
[1:29:04] and we know that all things work
[1:29:05] together
[1:29:07] for the good to them that love God
[1:29:10] to them who are the called
[1:29:13] and that day is very specific yeah
[1:29:16] they called according to his purpose
[1:29:19] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:29:22] predestinate
[1:29:24] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:29:26] that he might be the firstborn of my
[1:29:28] many Brethren and moreover whom he did
[1:29:30] predestinate then he also called and
[1:29:33] whom he called then he also Justified
[1:29:36] and whom he justified then he also
[1:29:39] glorified so the process in God's mind
[1:29:42] is already complete
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:48] you may not feel it yet but in God's
[1:29:50] mind it's already a finished work
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:29:56] you're praying for your prodigals to
[1:29:58] come home but in God's mind it's already
[1:30:01] God
[1:30:08] you're ringing your hands and you're
[1:30:10] tore all the pieces about it
[1:30:13] but in God's mind he'll not lose one
[1:30:21] he'll not lose one
[1:30:29] now what should we then say to these
[1:30:31] things
[1:30:32] if it's signed sealed and delivered what
[1:30:35] shall we then say to these things
[1:30:37] if God before us
[1:30:39] let's just settle it right here if God
[1:30:42] before us
[1:30:46] all of Hell could be against us
[1:30:52] he that spared not his son
[1:30:54] but delivered him up for us all how
[1:30:57] shall he
[1:30:59] not with him freely give us all things
[1:31:01] it all belongs to us
[1:31:06] now Paul is going to call the devil
[1:31:08] right out in the street
[1:31:10] so we will call him a a gunslinger
[1:31:14] or a sword Slinger
[1:31:19] who shall lay anything
[1:31:23] to the charge of God's elect
[1:31:29] who is going to come out and tell us
[1:31:31] about our past
[1:31:36] what demon is going to try to condemn us
[1:31:39] over and over again that's already
[1:31:41] Justified us
[1:31:44] and if he's Justified as it's as though
[1:31:46] we never did it in the first place
[1:31:50] it may be etched into your memory but
[1:31:53] not with God
[1:31:56] and Satan may have an Avenue to go
[1:31:58] through your memory Channel
[1:32:02] come on but that's not you
[1:32:06] it may look like the same house
[1:32:09] it may look like the same building but
[1:32:12] that there's a different King that is
[1:32:15] living down on the inside of that heart
[1:32:18] you're not that man no longer
[1:32:29] oh maybe you've got friends that were
[1:32:31] drug addicts with you or no parents or
[1:32:34] whatever they did with you
[1:32:37] and they may know the old man
[1:32:39] but that man
[1:32:46] don't live here no more
[1:32:48] [Applause]
[1:32:50] so therefore there is now no
[1:32:53] condemnation the deed is clear
[1:32:59] it's not held against us no more
[1:33:03] we don't need to go to jail for it we
[1:33:06] don't need to go to hell for it we don't
[1:33:08] need to beat ourselves for it we don't
[1:33:10] need Purgatory for it it's inclusion
[1:33:14] still delivered
[1:33:27] we have a rich jury
[1:33:32] we have a rip jury
[1:33:35] he's our lawyer
[1:33:38] and he's a passionate lawyer
[1:33:40] he's our judge
[1:33:42] and he's a passionate judge and he's
[1:33:45] also the jury
[1:33:51] I tell you what it feels like we don't
[1:33:53] have church in here
[1:33:55] we're going to have church up in here
[1:34:00] now Jesus knows the seat that he planted
[1:34:03] on the inside of you
[1:34:06] he doesn't just do that to see if he can
[1:34:12] he just doesn't deposit a seed in you
[1:34:15] well I'll pick this one up I'll pick
[1:34:18] that one
[1:34:19] I'll pick this one all right I'll pick
[1:34:21] that one he knows exactly what he's
[1:34:23] doing
[1:34:26] no he's not dependent on your flesh
[1:34:30] right he has
[1:34:32] that's not what he's interested in he'll
[1:34:35] change that after a while
[1:34:37] but he's going to put a king on the
[1:34:38] inside of your heart it may lay their
[1:34:41] dormant for a long time but all of a
[1:34:43] sudden that seat gets in the right
[1:34:45] atmosphere and gets quick into life
[1:34:49] I trust we believe that that safe gets
[1:34:51] quick and alive
[1:34:53] it's not a man planet that God planted
[1:34:57] that's what so confuses the devil so
[1:35:00] many times he's trying to destroy God's
[1:35:02] seed but he can't see where God
[1:35:04] deposited that
[1:35:10] because you and I would have never
[1:35:11] picked a naked man cursing on the boat
[1:35:14] but Jesus did
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:18] many of us would have never picked a
[1:35:20] woman at the well but Jesus did many of
[1:35:23] us would have never picked a woman that
[1:35:25] washes his feet but Jesus did many of us
[1:35:28] would have never picked our neighbor
[1:35:30] sitting in this church but Jesus did
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:43] thank you Lord
[1:35:47] now Jesus and his party birds are going
[1:35:49] to say these words
[1:35:50] and Jesus came and spake it to them
[1:35:54] say
[1:35:55] all power
[1:35:59] is given unto me
[1:36:03] heaven
[1:36:04] and in Earth
[1:36:07] now he's not just going to keep that
[1:36:09] power
[1:36:11] but he's going to ignite the seed inside
[1:36:13] of you
[1:36:15] to be able to use that
[1:36:21] Jesus would say these words
[1:36:24] if he abide in me
[1:36:27] and my words
[1:36:30] eternal life scene
[1:36:33] abide in you
[1:36:36] now you're going to do something with it
[1:36:37] you shall ask
[1:36:41] what you wear
[1:36:43] and it shall be done unto you
[1:36:47] there's a process that we go through
[1:36:50] many times we want things and forget to
[1:36:53] ask
[1:36:54] but there's a power release between you
[1:36:57] and father
[1:37:01] when you take its words and processes
[1:37:04] across your lips because remember prayer
[1:37:08] is more powerful than an atomic bomb
[1:37:16] your
[1:37:20] because you're a son and daughter
[1:37:22] that's what gives you Authority notice
[1:37:26] what brother random said who has more
[1:37:28] Authority an archangel in heaven
[1:37:32] they're servants whether man places it
[1:37:34] their servants he said a son and
[1:37:38] daughter of God
[1:37:40] has more Authority than an archangel
[1:37:48] listen we'd all be thrilled if Gabriel
[1:37:50] stepped into the room
[1:37:52] and we could visibly see him
[1:37:57] what a service that we'd walk away with
[1:37:59] but you set beside people that's more
[1:38:03] powerful
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:10] did you get it
[1:38:12] oh my brother on I went to a service and
[1:38:15] we saw an angel of the Lord you set
[1:38:17] beside
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:25] you sat beside people that's more
[1:38:28] powerful
[1:38:31] hey we can feel the influence of the
[1:38:33] Angel here now
[1:38:35] we feel him here we enjoy it you sung
[1:38:38] about him and he came
[1:38:41] and the reason he comes is because seeds
[1:38:44] are sitting here
[1:38:46] he don't come just to come he comes to
[1:38:48] worship with you
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:52] your his vision
[1:38:54] it's not Michelangelo standing with
[1:38:57] inspiration after all those years
[1:38:59] working and saying Speak because the
[1:39:01] Visions Now set before it listen this
[1:39:04] message came
[1:39:06] more than just to put it on a tape and
[1:39:08] put it in book form and be a good
[1:39:11] message it was depositing Siege all over
[1:39:15] the Earth
[1:39:17] God's been on a mission
[1:39:20] and he's watching you stand on the clap
[1:39:23] of Eternity
[1:39:25] dimensions are blooming
[1:39:29] you don't have to work up a Revival he's
[1:39:31] here
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:40] brother run but I'm afraid of emotion
[1:39:43] let me just say this to you if you don't
[1:39:44] get emotional about this
[1:39:49] I'm afraid no seed has come to life
[1:39:52] and it's still laying dormant this is
[1:39:55] the greatest thing that we can have
[1:40:07] brother Brown said God's purpose
[1:40:11] about the master of this day
[1:40:14] we can just say
[1:40:16] the greatest messenger that ever lived
[1:40:19] on the Earth
[1:40:22] but yet stood in such a humble form
[1:40:30] until the world Misty
[1:40:35] I like how brother Branham says it he
[1:40:38] says those they're seraphants
[1:40:42] he says when Matthew was writing
[1:40:45] Matthew 28 and 19.
[1:40:48] he was guarding the book of Acts
[1:40:51] the baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:40:53] Jesus Christ and he said he stands there
[1:40:57] and he said
[1:40:59] he blinds the eyes to where they can't
[1:41:02] get it
[1:41:04] but when it came to you he made sure
[1:41:06] you'd see it
[1:41:12] so brother Brandon preached to a lot of
[1:41:14] audience that were very combative with
[1:41:16] him
[1:41:18] get up walk out preacher set behind him
[1:41:21] making fun of him and doing all
[1:41:23] different kinds of things and and yet he
[1:41:26] was the one that was in contact with the
[1:41:28] messenger
[1:41:30] the author of the book
[1:41:32] and so he was just saying what he taught
[1:41:34] him to say because
[1:41:37] just as Jesus stood on the boat
[1:41:40] no and I've sold the seeds
[1:41:44] and some fall on stones and some fall
[1:41:47] into thorns and and some fall this but
[1:41:51] I've deposited seed in the ground
[1:41:54] I'm like a great contractor I've
[1:41:56] deposited seats in the ground I know
[1:41:59] where they're going to come up at
[1:42:05] now listen when God's ahead of a project
[1:42:09] I don't know if we have any project
[1:42:10] managers in here you don't quit in the
[1:42:13] middle of it
[1:42:15] it's pretty immature a lot of people
[1:42:17] want to quit in the middle of the middle
[1:42:19] middle of it
[1:42:21] God's not that kind sure he knew there
[1:42:23] was going to be issues that you would
[1:42:25] have
[1:42:26] but he fortified you with the greatest
[1:42:28] weapon that he could and gave you a
[1:42:31] channel to which you could talk to him
[1:42:34] and you could tell him oh god I've been
[1:42:37] a fool oh God I'm a rich or miserable
[1:42:39] ratchet oh god I've made so many
[1:42:42] mistakes today and oh God I'm I made a
[1:42:45] temper tanterman God didn't even
[1:42:49] he doing your time around that you were
[1:42:51] wrestling with your flesh and wrestling
[1:42:53] with laodicea and he knew you were
[1:42:56] fighting and struggling
[1:42:59] but all of that's just stuff
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:04] oh that's your stuff
[1:43:07] but God I'm getting older I'm past 90
[1:43:09] past 100 you said I'd have a child
[1:43:14] it didn't make God nervous none
[1:43:16] whatsoever
[1:43:18] when I got the Rapture would be
[1:43:20] happening and the resurrection would
[1:43:22] take place it don't make God nervous
[1:43:25] I want you I want you to know he's not
[1:43:27] in a crisis meeting tonight
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:34] and the adversary that he built
[1:43:40] and he sent him into the Earth
[1:43:42] he specifically sent him into the Earth
[1:43:46] to torment you and try you and God made
[1:43:50] him
[1:43:52] he made it he describes it
[1:43:55] and then at the end of it the very next
[1:43:58] paragraph and the quote says no weapon
[1:44:00] that is formed against thee
[1:44:02] [Applause]
[1:44:05] so God's got your battle settled
[1:44:10] [Applause]
[1:44:13] I don't know who I'm talking to but I'm
[1:44:15] just going to talk to you so
[1:44:19] you see I've never preached this at home
[1:44:21] so maybe they'll enjoy it when I get
[1:44:22] back home
[1:44:25] maybe you can text or send some of our
[1:44:27] people at home it's good you're going to
[1:44:28] enjoy it
[1:44:32] so when God deposits a seat
[1:44:36] he's not worried about your 155 pound
[1:44:39] flesh
[1:44:43] you left me out with one okay 320.
[1:44:49] 90 pound lady
[1:44:52] he's not concerned about that flesh
[1:44:55] because the seeds got power within
[1:44:57] itself
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:44:59] and when the Old King dies and the King
[1:45:02] takes over he'll take over your mouth
[1:45:06] he'll take over your thinking
[1:45:08] [Applause]
[1:45:10] he'll take over your eyes
[1:45:15] and you'll wrestling with this flesh but
[1:45:17] you know who's gonna win
[1:45:24] now brother Brandon uses this quote I I
[1:45:26] don't mean to abuse it but he says he
[1:45:29] knows
[1:45:30] that if the people
[1:45:32] yet the true revelation of the true
[1:45:34] church
[1:45:36] and what she is that's a specific
[1:45:38] purpose and what she is and what she
[1:45:41] stands for
[1:45:43] that she can do the Greater Works
[1:45:48] [Applause]
[1:45:49] brother Ron they
[1:45:50] powerful group of
[1:45:55] people you're missing the total point
[1:45:57] he's not just talking about preachers
[1:46:00] don't you get your eyes on whoever's
[1:46:03] standing up here
[1:46:04] you always be attentive to the voice
[1:46:07] behind The Voice
[1:46:09] because that voice is a discerner of
[1:46:12] your heart
[1:46:12] [Applause]
[1:46:16] the middle you and I we can have secrets
[1:46:19] of the tree
[1:46:21] and a guy that can get up and preach
[1:46:23] that can't preach his way out of a
[1:46:25] paperback
[1:46:29] if God anoints that man
[1:46:32] there will be one sentence in that hour
[1:46:35] sermon
[1:46:40] and you go that was for me
[1:46:45] I've had people walk up and say I'm
[1:46:47] sorry everybody else had to come just
[1:46:49] for me to get that sermon
[1:46:59] because you realize that this this we
[1:47:03] are as ministers are very we hate gossip
[1:47:07] powers
[1:47:10] because discernment can't work with a
[1:47:12] gossip party
[1:47:14] and the work don't need a gossip for her
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:18] so all of a sudden the preacher's
[1:47:20] preaching and he's in your living room
[1:47:23] he's in your car coming to church
[1:47:28] [Applause]
[1:47:32] and all of a sudden you realize hey
[1:47:34] somebody was in the car duh
[1:47:38] [Applause]
[1:47:43] hey that's from Virginia it's okay we'll
[1:47:47] get through it yeah we'll get through it
[1:47:53] now when brother Brandon was staying
[1:47:55] this this particular sentence
[1:47:58] he said I'm so glad
[1:48:00] that a man can sow completely
[1:48:05] serve God
[1:48:07] tell the devil
[1:48:10] don't know what to do with him
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:15] now God just don't drop that sentence
[1:48:18] for a fairy tale
[1:48:22] he's got seed on the Earth
[1:48:25] that he could put their life story in
[1:48:28] that
[1:48:32] they're not wishy-washy they're not
[1:48:34] tossed about on a seed
[1:48:39] let the world coming upside down and
[1:48:42] they are still having victory
[1:48:48] but the man who uses this term he says
[1:48:51] Satan
[1:48:53] cannot take your life
[1:48:55] until God is finished with you
[1:49:02] now I'm dropping that sentence there
[1:49:04] because I am a living reality of that
[1:49:09] quote
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:13] so it's not just a Hollywood quote here
[1:49:17] it's not just Walt Disney quote here
[1:49:21] God is going to have a people
[1:49:24] that can have that short hanging over
[1:49:27] them
[1:49:30] and instead of cancer be way out front
[1:49:33] and getting all the glory
[1:49:36] it'll be like Joshua and Caleb
[1:49:41] sure there's Giants over there
[1:49:44] but it's a good land
[1:49:57] it's a good land
[1:50:05] sure I've got four stage cancer I'm not
[1:50:07] crazy
[1:50:09] tumors on my temples and stuff going in
[1:50:12] my head and taking chemo every day some
[1:50:15] days are good days some days are really
[1:50:17] bad days
[1:50:19] tumors in my lungs
[1:50:22] in my lymph nodes
[1:50:26] but the miracle is I get to live every
[1:50:28] day
[1:50:31] when I wake up in the morning
[1:50:34] the devil ought to be terrified
[1:50:39] of what God's about to do today
[1:50:41] [Applause]
[1:50:44] I don't want to be a whiny Fox
[1:50:47] negative atmosphere huh
[1:50:51] an overcomer
[1:50:52] [Applause]
[1:51:08] because brother random had a
[1:51:10] conversation about me
[1:51:13] in a cave
[1:51:19] she wasn't just mythically talking
[1:51:21] right
[1:51:23] the angel was in a cave with him giving
[1:51:26] him his permission
[1:51:28] and he was telling me we couldn't do it
[1:51:30] you know I'll be with you
[1:51:33] they had the conversation that came to a
[1:51:35] point to where
[1:51:37] that he would even talk about how that
[1:51:39] everything would be subject
[1:51:41] it wasn't the angel that brought up
[1:51:43] cancer it was brother Brown
[1:51:47] and he said not even cancer
[1:51:52] so if you're suffering from cancer today
[1:51:54] brother Brown had a conversation in the
[1:51:57] cave
[1:51:58] with your condition
[1:52:02] you do not have to live to it dominated
[1:52:05] and scared of it and negative of it
[1:52:07] because in God's mind it's already
[1:52:09] defeated
[1:52:12] [Applause]
[1:52:15] Hey listen either these quotes are real
[1:52:18] or they're not real
[1:52:19] I happen to believe that
[1:52:40] so I want to read that quote again to
[1:52:41] you Satan
[1:52:44] cannot put your life
[1:52:49] and living proof he's trapped
[1:52:53] and if he could
[1:52:56] he would
[1:53:03] because I make them mad every week
[1:53:10] I'm not reading poetry here
[1:53:12] I'm not being real soft to the church
[1:53:15] I'm I'm motivating you encouraging you
[1:53:17] strengthen you
[1:53:20] telling you to put your boots on and
[1:53:22] pull your sword and fight
[1:53:23] we're not a bunch of cowards we're
[1:53:25] rugged everyday Christians
[1:53:28] we're warriors in this end time we will
[1:53:32] overcome
[1:53:34] I'm not giving you a political speech
[1:53:36] I'm telling you we are built in the mind
[1:53:39] of God
[1:53:40] we were the seeds that were distributed
[1:53:42] in the earth and now we're here to take
[1:53:46] a rapture
[1:53:48] [Applause]
[1:53:50] and so we stand here
[1:53:53] I believe I can stand here like
[1:53:55] probably no other man could stand four
[1:53:58] stage brain cancer
[1:54:00] and take this quote and make it live
[1:54:03] and you could say I haven't seen a
[1:54:05] miracle look
[1:54:08] open your brown eyes blue eyes red eyes
[1:54:11] gray eyes whatever you got and look
[1:54:15] [Applause]
[1:54:19] you're looking this way in a miracle I'm
[1:54:22] looking that way
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:28] what do you mean brother Ron Satan's
[1:54:30] done everything that he could to destroy
[1:54:32] you
[1:54:33] he's forever devil against you and
[1:54:36] dispatched them to torment your life and
[1:54:39] you're still standing
[1:54:55] some of you really would be into
[1:54:56] depression if you realize how many
[1:54:58] demons were fighting
[1:55:01] and how often they have to go back to
[1:55:03] hell and say I couldn't they still got
[1:55:05] up and went to church Sunday they rolled
[1:55:08] out of bed and they prayed and their
[1:55:11] prayers went right to the king of glory
[1:55:13] and he heard them and he dispatched
[1:55:16] angels to take care of them
[1:55:18] they're better protective than the
[1:55:20] president of the United States of
[1:55:22] America
[1:55:24] he's just forgetful but you're as
[1:55:26] children of God you call God's word
[1:55:30] and say this works for me
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:42] I know we hear this a lot of times
[1:55:46] final voice
[1:55:49] to the final age
[1:55:53] search it
[1:55:54] no other messenger said
[1:56:01] no other charismatic preacher said
[1:56:06] but the one that was standing there in
[1:56:08] the book was on opened
[1:56:12] and he stood there and said this is not
[1:56:14] my thoughts he met me in the room I
[1:56:17] would have made a horrible mistake but
[1:56:19] he can't
[1:56:20] you see the author of the book walked
[1:56:23] into the room
[1:56:25] this was not going to be a
[1:56:26] denominational bride
[1:56:28] [Applause]
[1:56:29] this was going to the seeds of eternal
[1:56:32] life
[1:56:34] that would capture this word
[1:56:40] and he would give Insurance like future
[1:56:43] home because that's what you're going to
[1:56:45] live in
[1:56:47] who is this male president because that
[1:56:50] same melchizedek's walking among you
[1:56:52] even now
[1:56:53] [Applause]
[1:56:58] he would give him a sermon like things
[1:57:00] that are to be
[1:57:04] talking about a prophetic
[1:57:06] message
[1:57:10] just go to the title
[1:57:13] yes sir
[1:57:16] there are to be
[1:57:23] we're not built kingdoms here
[1:57:28] we've got nice churches but we're going
[1:57:30] to leave this
[1:57:37] we sat in a service like this
[1:57:42] maybe you're sitting here and you're
[1:57:43] fighting a kidney infection
[1:57:46] bad back
[1:57:49] you're just fighting to keep your
[1:57:51] attention because you had to work so
[1:57:53] long
[1:57:58] you know you know he knows everything
[1:58:03] and you're going you know well that
[1:58:04] service you know I didn't get nothing
[1:58:06] out of it
[1:58:07] well what you don't realize that it's
[1:58:09] not over with when you walk out
[1:58:16] and your Earth your your ears hurt
[1:58:20] things
[1:58:24] that you couldn't comprehend maybe four
[1:58:26] or five days later two weeks later all
[1:58:29] of a sudden it hits you
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:33] and the light comes on
[1:58:43] final voice
[1:58:45] to the final age brother men oh God made
[1:58:48] you a promise in this generation
[1:58:51] this generation
[1:58:55] you know God ain't done with you
[1:58:57] I just want to tell you God's not done
[1:58:59] with you
[1:59:00] he's not
[1:59:02] it's not done at all
[1:59:04] as a matter of fact guys like you
[1:59:07] are the most dangerous guys
[1:59:13] they're the most dangerous guy
[1:59:16] he's probably got 40 50 years of
[1:59:18] preaching
[1:59:20] what's an interesting thing is I was a
[1:59:22] boy
[1:59:23] playing a set of drums
[1:59:26] on brother fulcher's pulpit in
[1:59:29] Christian's birth
[1:59:30] and this guy with a bunch of other men
[1:59:33] Come and sing it was it was like heaven
[1:59:37] drop dead
[1:59:39] and that God
[1:59:41] y'all have a boy
[1:59:43] he comes over and pays me special
[1:59:45] attention I know you don't remember
[1:59:48] but I do
[1:59:51] and here we set tonight
[1:59:55] we're gonna put all of this together
[2:00:01] recently brother Tim Pruitt sent me a a
[2:00:04] picture he was 18 years old
[2:00:06] and he went to he went to Jeffersonville
[2:00:09] and you know as a boy he thought
[2:00:11] Minister said on the platform so he took
[2:00:13] his place on the platform
[2:00:16] all the other guys wasn't preachers
[2:00:19] they took his picture there he is
[2:00:21] sitting there 18 years old
[2:00:23] and I looked at it and asked him when it
[2:00:26] was
[2:00:27] I started collating the dates
[2:00:31] well I was in the same meeting
[2:00:36] and we couldn't get a seat out front
[2:00:39] so my dad and myself sat in the
[2:00:42] baptistry
[2:00:46] now think about it
[2:00:50] Tim bro one of the greatest preachers
[2:00:52] ever lives
[2:00:53] don't know that the
[2:00:55] the seats are for other people he just
[2:01:02] and saying just a couple feet behind the
[2:01:05] the curtain
[2:01:10] is another one of these boys
[2:01:16] don't God have a sense in here
[2:01:23] foreign
[2:01:29] he knew where he planted you
[2:01:31] you thought now you thought you
[2:01:33] staggered into a mission house somewhere
[2:01:35] another
[2:01:39] you thought by incidents that you were
[2:01:41] being called and all of a sudden you
[2:01:43] find yourself at the altar and you're
[2:01:44] giving your heart to God it's only the
[2:01:46] beginning of your life
[2:01:52] so I was talking about brother minnow
[2:01:54] and I'm not done
[2:01:57] it's not Alzheimer's
[2:01:59] came up
[2:02:05] and so
[2:02:07] the devil says Ah he's old he won't
[2:02:08] bother me now
[2:02:10] think again
[2:02:15] you got 40 Years of ministry 50 years of
[2:02:17] ministry
[2:02:18] you swatted a lot of devils
[2:02:22] don't you know your prayer
[2:02:26] shakes the kingdom of hell
[2:02:29] and there's no order like an old Warrior
[2:02:33] I'm talking to you Ray
[2:02:38] you're not dying
[2:02:39] [Applause]
[2:02:58] who gathered us
[2:03:05] who gathered us
[2:03:08] Saskatoon
[2:03:11] where it's blue blaze is called
[2:03:16] these guys are going to get a special
[2:03:18] spot in heaven
[2:03:23] when the wind blows it really blows
[2:03:30] I'm a
[2:03:33] when it comes to cold air I'm I'm an
[2:03:35] assistant
[2:03:37] I like a stove
[2:03:43] I like heat
[2:03:45] the more blood thinners I'm on the more
[2:03:48] heat I need
[2:03:51] Connie's gonna live through it she's
[2:03:53] going to lift up
[2:03:58] but who gathered us Jude
[2:04:00] brother
[2:04:01] who gathered us I said Brother Ray I'm
[2:04:04] sorry
[2:04:05] we're friends yeah
[2:04:07] you want a quote for that
[2:04:10] brother Brown said if you let me calling
[2:04:11] me Bill
[2:04:13] [Applause]
[2:04:15] I caught that a second ago
[2:04:19] who gathered us
[2:04:21] who put us all together here
[2:04:25] no man could do that
[2:04:27] I don't care how great a personality a
[2:04:29] preacher is and when I gather to a
[2:04:31] personality of a Preacher
[2:04:33] you look long enough you're going to
[2:04:35] find mistakes in men
[2:04:37] [Applause]
[2:04:40] oh brother Ron I can't believe you got
[2:04:42] no States ask that girl
[2:04:44] never mind
[2:04:51] so who gathered us
[2:04:53] the infinite God
[2:04:57] who knows every time that a that a fly
[2:05:01] or a flea would bet its eyes that's set
[2:05:04] in things that are to be
[2:05:05] he preplans you
[2:05:09] that infinite God pre-planned you and it
[2:05:12] don't just do it to do it
[2:05:22] so if God condensated his way through
[2:05:24] the Old Testament
[2:05:27] then he condescended his way through the
[2:05:29] New Testament
[2:05:30] and he says that you're the final voice
[2:05:34] he's got something on his mind
[2:05:44] then the work that you're listening to
[2:05:49] I always get it I always get
[2:05:52] forgive me I'm just going to tell you my
[2:05:53] heart
[2:05:55] I've been a very emotional person
[2:05:57] we have an emotional
[2:06:03] we Shout
[2:06:10] when he Rejoice don't get cold on me now
[2:06:15] we Shout
[2:06:16] people stand to their feet and applaud
[2:06:19] while the word's going forward
[2:06:22] and they're inspired
[2:06:26] well brother
[2:06:29] we're mature
[2:06:33] I would say sometimes rotten
[2:06:37] because the word has the power
[2:06:41] to take motorcycle gang guys and make
[2:06:45] real Christians out of them
[2:06:59] to take women of the red light district
[2:07:01] and make real daughters of God out of
[2:07:04] them
[2:07:05] and when you look in the audience you
[2:07:07] can't tell who's who
[2:07:09] [Applause]
[2:07:23] so let me just say this to you
[2:07:26] when you I'm gonna pick on you when
[2:07:28] you've got a guy
[2:07:31] like Ben Erickson
[2:07:35] leading you in worship
[2:07:39] around the revealed word of the hour
[2:07:42] and it causes emotion in the church and
[2:07:46] an atmosphere to take place
[2:07:48] and the littlest children hit the floor
[2:07:51] [Applause]
[2:07:54] because Scott's going to raise those
[2:07:56] Limitless children up
[2:07:59] because even as a child they recognize
[2:08:01] the atmosphere
[2:08:16] I need a quote brother on you picked the
[2:08:20] right man
[2:08:23] Jesus is riding off of the mountain
[2:08:27] on a coat
[2:08:29] and for that description to be right it
[2:08:32] had to have never been Monroe
[2:08:36] it would have to be a miracle when they
[2:08:38] put a blanket on him and Jesus gets on
[2:08:41] it
[2:08:43] a phenomenal Miracle but you see what
[2:08:47] you can't see is he was the master
[2:08:52] [Applause]
[2:08:54] and not only are you designed God
[2:08:56] designed that cult
[2:09:01] to ride him off in Perfect Harmony and
[2:09:04] perfect peace and he rides down and
[2:09:06] everybody's under the inspiration of
[2:09:08] worship
[2:09:10] and that was something that had said
[2:09:12] caused him to get quiet
[2:09:18] they don't
[2:09:28] now why would I drop that right there
[2:09:30] your worship's important
[2:09:37] because nobody can worship God like his
[2:09:41] children
[2:09:46] charismatic worship people worship
[2:09:48] people worship a lot of different gods
[2:09:50] people in big ball games worship the
[2:09:53] devil don't get upset at Ohio State
[2:09:57] come on
[2:09:58] okay some of you across the border he
[2:10:00] don't get upset with Purdue
[2:10:05] he don't get upset when you're screaming
[2:10:07] and pulling your shirt off and screaming
[2:10:09] touchdown
[2:10:13] but the devil gets upset
[2:10:16] when you recognize Who You Are
[2:10:25] and you recognize your position that I
[2:10:28] am a son
[2:10:30] that's my husband that's my God
[2:10:34] broken they're not going back to him
[2:10:37] so therefore I'm not going to wait on
[2:10:39] streets of gold
[2:10:43] I'm not going to wait on streets of gold
[2:10:45] to display my love for him
[2:10:48] and I'm gonna do it with passion
[2:10:52] you're gonna get beside myself
[2:10:56] I have to fight this thing all week long
[2:10:58] but when I get into his atmosphere
[2:11:02] where I feel him
[2:11:03] [Applause]
[2:11:21] I want you to think what a big statement
[2:11:22] that is
[2:11:24] I came from God yeah
[2:11:27] and I'm going back to God
[2:11:36] I'm sorry I don't go crazy like I used
[2:11:38] to but
[2:11:39] this is just a different gear sometimes
[2:11:41] you just have to reinvent yourself
[2:11:46] sometimes I just have to catch my breath
[2:11:49] can you get can you give me that now
[2:11:53] I don't want you to think about that
[2:11:55] that's more than just final voice to the
[2:11:57] final age
[2:11:59] it's more than just I came from God but
[2:12:02] I'm going back to God
[2:12:04] but you see the photo album
[2:12:08] is now flesh
[2:12:13] and you've received a message that told
[2:12:16] you that and you caught it
[2:12:19] and Jesus would say
[2:12:22] blessed are their ears
[2:12:25] they hear
[2:12:31] blessed are their eyes
[2:12:33] they see
[2:12:35] now don't worry about the people that
[2:12:37] don't believe
[2:12:38] don't wrestle yourself much with that
[2:12:41] you know you can't make them believe
[2:12:43] you can't make goats cheap
[2:12:49] you couldn't make yourself anything but
[2:12:52] one day you just woke up come on wow
[2:12:56] that's a truth
[2:13:02] and you may set 10 years in this church
[2:13:05] what's really going on
[2:13:07] let's go
[2:13:10] you know I don't know believe this or
[2:13:12] not
[2:13:14] you know they get emotional here and
[2:13:16] they scream and they preach two hours
[2:13:18] and
[2:13:20] you know
[2:13:24] I got things to do well what is that at
[2:13:27] Burger King
[2:13:33] what are you gonna do then
[2:13:39] and he'll start worrying in your mind
[2:13:41] about your
[2:13:42] car
[2:13:44] the house
[2:13:45] these kind of things distracting you
[2:13:48] because he knows
[2:13:54] then all of a sudden you realize that
[2:13:56] hey he's talking about me
[2:13:59] it's talking about me sometimes
[2:14:01] teenagers as they're growing up and it's
[2:14:02] you know they're coming to church
[2:14:04] because Mom and Dad's bringing them to
[2:14:05] church yeah and then all of a sudden in
[2:14:08] a service
[2:14:09] boom
[2:14:14] boom
[2:14:15] now they're at church with purpose
[2:14:17] [Applause]
[2:14:19] now they're coughing their hands with
[2:14:21] paraplex I'm going there somewhere
[2:14:23] [Applause]
[2:14:26] now there ain't many with purpose
[2:14:29] [Applause]
[2:14:35] when you realize you're living your life
[2:14:37] with purpose
[2:14:50] when I was in China
[2:14:52] preaching
[2:14:55] and I spoke I spoke about we must get to
[2:14:58] Jesus
[2:15:00] and Jarius
[2:15:02] had to leave his house
[2:15:04] and had to leave his position had to
[2:15:07] leave his reputation because his
[2:15:09] daughter was dying and he couldn't help
[2:15:11] her
[2:15:13] he went to a source
[2:15:17] and it was the only source he could knew
[2:15:19] that was real
[2:15:22] and when he finally got to him and
[2:15:25] caught his attention
[2:15:28] Jesus said I'll come with you
[2:15:32] and then people came and said she's
[2:15:34] dying don't don't trouble
[2:15:36] and Jesus notice what he does standing
[2:15:38] in Two Worlds at the same time
[2:15:42] he said don't fear
[2:15:45] don't fear
[2:15:47] because Jesus knew she was getting ready
[2:15:48] to come to life
[2:15:52] and I'm going somewhere here
[2:15:54] he already knows where you're going
[2:15:57] it's not you just saying I came from God
[2:15:59] going back to God God knows that you're
[2:16:02] coming
[2:16:07] so I'm in China preaching to about 200
[2:16:10] people
[2:16:11] in a building that's jam-packed
[2:16:14] and all of us could get arrested
[2:16:17] and I'm preaching
[2:16:19] and as I'm preaching
[2:16:23] brother Murphy warm collapses on the
[2:16:25] pulpit I had to wait till he finished
[2:16:27] because I don't speak Chinese
[2:16:32] my brother Murphy collapses because we
[2:16:34] realize that Jesus is orchestrated this
[2:16:37] meeting
[2:16:41] and if we could realize that it's not
[2:16:42] just in China
[2:16:44] or in Saskatoon or in Lima or in
[2:16:47] Virginia
[2:16:48] God orchestrates the service
[2:16:56] what ensued was a six hour
[2:16:59] prayer line
[2:17:04] there was a lady who walked across the
[2:17:07] stage
[2:17:09] she was about your your bill
[2:17:11] your height
[2:17:17] and the Lord spoke through me to her
[2:17:19] through brother Murphy Wong
[2:17:22] you're a woman of great influence
[2:17:25] and you're over many people
[2:17:31] told her the needs of her heart
[2:17:34] and brother minnow
[2:17:37] she spoke to brother Murphy
[2:17:39] and said oh the doctor of an entire
[2:17:43] Hospital
[2:17:47] I had no way of knowing
[2:17:52] I know you as a doctor
[2:17:55] and I have great admiration
[2:17:58] because you're an agent on the Earth
[2:18:00] right
[2:18:02] amen you may have struggle and want and
[2:18:05] to be a doctor
[2:18:07] and you studied a lot of long hours
[2:18:10] and it's because of you're going to be
[2:18:12] of great help to humanity
[2:18:23] the very next woman
[2:18:26] was a woman that heard some of the same
[2:18:28] words you're a woman of great influence
[2:18:32] you're a powerful woman
[2:18:35] she was over a hundred
[2:18:38] a hundred underground churches
[2:18:46] and she took this message to a hundred
[2:18:49] Underground
[2:18:53] it's more than just a statement I'll not
[2:18:56] lose one
[2:19:00] China can do what they want to do to
[2:19:02] shut it down
[2:19:03] Russia can do what they want to do to
[2:19:05] shut it down
[2:19:08] this Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:19:10] government that we've got can do what
[2:19:13] they want to do
[2:19:15] just shut it down it's too late
[2:19:27] the seeds already been deposited
[2:19:32] they will come up
[2:19:35] they will come up
[2:19:38] that may be 40 feet deep but they will
[2:19:41] come out
[2:19:43] they may be in the deepest time but they
[2:19:46] will come on
[2:19:48] [Applause]
[2:19:56] amen
[2:19:59] I just tell you one more story
[2:20:03] brother Brown talks in the greatest
[2:20:04] battle ever fought
[2:20:09] and he goes back
[2:20:12] you know he's not under the direction of
[2:20:14] his own mind
[2:20:15] because he said you're not feeding a
[2:20:17] mind of a man defeating on the body work
[2:20:20] of the son of a man
[2:20:23] so he's in the middle of the greatest
[2:20:25] battle it's ever fought
[2:20:27] and of all the people he picks he picks
[2:20:30] a man named Peter Cartwright
[2:20:35] and so Peter Cartwright you remember
[2:20:37] maybe for those that don't know Peter
[2:20:39] Cartman was the man that was led to go
[2:20:41] to a town to have a Revival
[2:20:43] he didn't ask nobody just found an empty
[2:20:46] building started cleaning it up went in
[2:20:48] and started cleaning the windows and a
[2:20:50] bully of the Town came
[2:20:54] and said you can't have emotional
[2:20:55] worship here
[2:21:05] you you you you you can't have a meeting
[2:21:08] here
[2:21:10] and so he lays out the boundary the
[2:21:13] devil's always in a problem when he lays
[2:21:15] out the boundary
[2:21:17] he said to have a meeting here
[2:21:19] you're going to have to whip me first
[2:21:22] well he was talking to the wrong
[2:21:24] preacher
[2:21:27] because God had a seed sinned into the
[2:21:30] Earth
[2:21:32] that would accept the challenge
[2:21:38] and so Peter Cartwright climbs down off
[2:21:41] of his ladder
[2:21:43] rolls up his sleeves should hear Brother
[2:21:45] Brown and describe it
[2:21:48] just like he's standing there I would
[2:21:50] say probably once
[2:21:53] and he sees the vision of how he did it
[2:21:55] he rolls up his sleeves and he whips the
[2:21:58] man
[2:22:05] now you may not know this but Peter
[2:22:08] can't wait was at another meeting
[2:22:13] and he was at another meeting and 30 men
[2:22:16] walked in and Disturbed the service
[2:22:19] I'd probably cause a church split if it
[2:22:21] happened today
[2:22:22] 30 men was going to shut it down
[2:22:26] well if I could say this in the right
[2:22:27] way probably 30 devils
[2:22:31] and our average service wants to walk in
[2:22:34] and shut the spirit of God down
[2:22:37] and there was a lot of preachers there
[2:22:39] but Peter Cartwright jumped right down
[2:22:42] and begin to whip one at a time
[2:22:46] and when he got done 30 men was whipped
[2:22:58] I'm preaching to you a god with purpose
[2:23:01] I'm talking about one of his sin
[2:23:05] I tell you where Peter Cartwright came
[2:23:07] from my area
[2:23:23] listen there's no Yankee heaven
[2:23:27] and there's no Southern habit it's all
[2:23:30] heaven
[2:23:34] but God knew where your dirt was going
[2:23:36] to come from
[2:23:37] [Applause]
[2:23:41] it's on Sunday morning after a Wednesday
[2:23:43] night whipping 30 men
[2:23:45] all the preachers said I can't get under
[2:23:48] any inspiration to preach he said well I
[2:23:50] can't
[2:23:53] and he walked to the pulpit and preached
[2:23:55] a sermon called the Gates of Hell shall
[2:23:58] not prevail
[2:23:59] [Applause]
[2:24:04] and the meeting lasted all day Sunday
[2:24:08] and on my Sunday night
[2:24:10] and all day Monday and all night Monday
[2:24:13] night and all day Tuesday
[2:24:16] on Tuesday night and on Wednesday they
[2:24:19] baptized over 300 people
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:35] that's the kind of spiritual DNA that he
[2:24:38] put on the inside of you
[2:24:40] and the stupid death that wants to fight
[2:24:43] it
[2:24:47] he can't realize where we came from and
[2:24:49] where we're going he's just trying to
[2:24:52] disturb the trip too late
[2:25:11] I got two more quotes for you and I'm
[2:25:12] done I'm whipped
[2:25:21] God allowed this to be said himself
[2:25:25] in Revelation chapter 19.
[2:25:28] he said let us be glad and rejoice
[2:25:34] for the Lamb's wife
[2:25:36] has made herself ready
[2:25:44] that was said 2 000 years ago
[2:25:51] I want you to think
[2:25:53] our Prophet said your natural seed was
[2:25:55] on the Earth
[2:26:00] probably some of them were the meanest
[2:26:03] Rascals ever lived
[2:26:06] so don't go bragging you ought to know
[2:26:09] my family
[2:26:13] no no my friend my family came from I
[2:26:17] was born in royalty and I came to the
[2:26:19] president I may look like Teddy
[2:26:27] and I've got pictures of him on my wall
[2:26:30] and I like a lot of things he did
[2:26:39] I'm sorry I'm going to step out here
[2:26:41] just a minute
[2:26:42] the last time brother biscal and myself
[2:26:44] was here preaching brother Bissell said
[2:26:46] about right there
[2:26:48] and he he told me later he said brother
[2:26:50] Ron
[2:26:52] I'm sorry he said I could help and
[2:26:55] helped but think as I was sitting there
[2:26:56] watching you he said I thought well this
[2:26:58] is what Teddy Roosevelt would have been
[2:27:00] as a preacher
[2:27:03] [Applause]
[2:27:18] I don't want you to think about it
[2:27:20] what you think about it just for a
[2:27:21] minute
[2:27:22] God knew what you'd look like
[2:27:25] they knew your characteristics
[2:27:28] he knew everything about you
[2:27:35] you remember when we were standing in a
[2:27:37] stairwell many years ago
[2:27:41] I'm pointing at you just go ahead and
[2:27:43] raise your hand so you know who I'm
[2:27:44] talking about yeah you know black-headed
[2:27:46] got glasses on right there Richard get
[2:27:48] your wife to raise her hand she hadn't
[2:27:51] got it yet
[2:27:52] some of you get it today some of you get
[2:27:54] it tomorrow
[2:27:58] okay
[2:28:05] we pray for you to have children you
[2:28:07] remember that
[2:28:09] she was standing in the in the stairwell
[2:28:13] and she said
[2:28:15] I didn't know how many I was gonna have
[2:28:28] and maybe you're sitting here and going
[2:28:30] I'm trying to have a child don't you
[2:28:31] worry
[2:28:31] [Music]
[2:28:34] God knows what it is deposited
[2:28:39] it's impossible
[2:28:43] if it's a seed there
[2:28:45] it's going to come up
[2:28:49] amen it's going to come up God's not
[2:28:52] nervous you can't have children
[2:28:55] you got one standing on the other side
[2:28:57] that knows all of this message
[2:29:01] that knows this message is real
[2:29:05] this experience that she's about 18 19
[2:29:07] years old and she's in perfect health
[2:29:11] [Applause]
[2:29:13] and here's the whole deal she knows
[2:29:15] you're coming
[2:29:33] now maybe for people that don't know
[2:29:35] when brother Branham
[2:29:38] was there and he saw his daughter
[2:29:43] she talked to him about the things that
[2:29:45] he heard on Earth
[2:29:47] and he preached on Earth yeah
[2:29:50] you preached this listen she dies as an
[2:29:54] infant
[2:30:01] listen death ain't nothing to fear you
[2:30:04] guys just experienced it Brother David
[2:30:06] as your family
[2:30:08] your father your mother stepped from
[2:30:09] this Dimension and in a second
[2:30:14] in a second all of these quotes
[2:30:23] were real
[2:30:28] David if I can say this as a friend
[2:30:31] she knows you're coming
[2:30:39] I'm in my closing statements
[2:30:44] everything Ken talked about
[2:30:47] my last conversation with him
[2:30:49] he was one of the most positive people
[2:30:54] I ever knew
[2:30:58] and I talked to him about two weeks
[2:30:59] before his going
[2:31:03] I'll remember where I was at we were
[2:31:05] crossing the bridge
[2:31:08] and we had a conversation
[2:31:11] I called to encourage him
[2:31:16] and he accepted the challenge and
[2:31:18] encouraged me
[2:31:21] because in actuality he was better off
[2:31:23] than I was
[2:31:27] and he was fighting cancer
[2:31:30] and he was getting ready to take a a
[2:31:32] little trip
[2:31:35] and I was getting ready to fight what he
[2:31:38] was fighting
[2:31:39] so I needed the sermon that he gave me
[2:31:50] I knew you was going to be here so I put
[2:31:52] that there
[2:31:55] so sometimes you're sitting in church
[2:31:58] and don't know why a preacher's saying
[2:32:00] what he's saying
[2:32:01] but the god
[2:32:03] knows what you're going to face two
[2:32:05] weeks from now
[2:32:12] the last time I was here I addressed
[2:32:15] this audience
[2:32:16] in my opening comments about maybe not
[2:32:20] being here ever again
[2:32:22] I don't know why I was saying that but
[2:32:24] brother Tom
[2:32:26] I was saying that
[2:32:30] Charlie
[2:32:33] his way
[2:32:35] you went through some incredible
[2:32:37] tragedies
[2:32:39] but if we could look at that
[2:32:42] all of these quotes became a living
[2:32:45] reality in a moment
[2:32:49] and if I can say it right Satan gets no
[2:32:51] credit
[2:32:54] [Applause]
[2:33:18] so those he knew
[2:33:22] he justified them
[2:33:24] he called them he justified them and
[2:33:27] he's glorified them
[2:33:29] so if we could look at this book more
[2:33:31] than a history book
[2:33:33] but this is God's thoughts
[2:33:37] when he turns to his disciples and he
[2:33:39] said
[2:33:40] I go to prepare a place for you
[2:33:45] is that where I am there you may be
[2:33:47] awesome
[2:33:50] and if I can say this just the way that
[2:33:52] I need to
[2:33:53] there's a married supper
[2:33:56] brother Brown describes it
[2:33:59] hundreds of miles well
[2:34:01] 1500 miles I believe it's a statement
[2:34:06] there's not going to be an extra check
[2:34:14] now I'm saying it quietly but I feel
[2:34:16] like doing a cartwheel
[2:34:18] I've never done one
[2:34:27] but if you could see the inside of me I
[2:34:29] feel like shouting all over this
[2:34:30] building
[2:34:32] because God not only sees me standing
[2:34:34] here preaching this meeting
[2:34:38] but he sees what I'm going to sit
[2:34:44] thank you
[2:34:57] if you get this Satan's going to have a
[2:35:00] hard time Monday
[2:35:06] now I've kind of told you where you came
[2:35:10] from
[2:35:13] you mind if I tell you your future sure
[2:35:17] and I saw a new habit yeah
[2:35:22] it's not John's words
[2:35:25] it's his words
[2:35:27] kind of new Earth
[2:35:29] for the first heaven
[2:35:32] and the first Earth were passed away
[2:35:35] so don't get so attached to this
[2:35:40] and there was no more Street
[2:35:42] Zach he'll provide fish you know
[2:35:44] somewhere
[2:35:50] Zachary is your hand right there you go
[2:35:52] it'll be all right
[2:35:54] Zach's kind of like Peter
[2:35:57] you know
[2:35:58] brother Branham says it so eloquently he
[2:36:01] said you always have a hook in his
[2:36:02] pocket
[2:36:06] now your wife might not enjoy it as much
[2:36:08] as you do but
[2:36:09] always have a hook in your pocket
[2:36:17] program
[2:36:20] and I John saw the holy city
[2:36:23] a New Jerusalem you're talking about
[2:36:24] standing in Two Worlds at the same time
[2:36:26] yeah
[2:36:27] yeah well the brand would say that
[2:36:28] prayer line she said I'm standing in Two
[2:36:30] Worlds
[2:36:34] a New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[2:36:38] of Heaven prepared as a bride of
[2:36:41] dornford her husband amen and I heard a
[2:36:44] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[2:36:46] the tabernacleism is of God is with men
[2:36:50] and he will dwell with them
[2:36:52] and they shall be his people
[2:36:55] and God himself shall be with them
[2:36:59] and be their God
[2:37:03] not just the service
[2:37:07] no Timex is there
[2:37:11] and God shall wipe away
[2:37:14] all tears
[2:37:16] [Music]
[2:37:22] now I want to read this to them
[2:37:26] and there shall be no more death
[2:37:30] neither sorrow
[2:37:32] or crying
[2:37:34] and there shall be
[2:37:36] there and there shall be any more pain
[2:37:38] for the former things
[2:37:44] and he that set upon the throne said
[2:37:47] behold
[2:37:54] so why should I fear cancer
[2:37:59] why should I have a pity party
[2:38:02] why should we be whiny boxes
[2:38:06] service is more than service
[2:38:10] God's talking about
[2:38:15] I want you to turn to your neighbor and
[2:38:16] say God's been talking about you
[2:38:20] the last 61 minutes I got the timer
[2:38:23] right here
[2:38:28] Give the Lord
[2:38:40] Hallelujah
[2:38:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:38:46] aren't you glad he said on this long
[2:38:49] thing
[2:39:11] so when God builds a man
[2:39:13] we don't really know the man until we
[2:39:16] see his work
[2:39:19] you think we know him
[2:39:21] in fact we know his attributes
[2:39:24] but it's just like a man when he marries
[2:39:25] a wife we see the inside of him
[2:39:30] because he marries a wife that would
[2:39:31] reflect the character
[2:39:37] so Ben
[2:39:39] and that perfect body
[2:39:42] walk from the back of the church to the
[2:39:44] front of the church
[2:39:46] because he knows his position
[2:39:49] what you don't realize is is when he
[2:39:52] begins to sing
[2:39:54] it displays a gift from God yeah
[2:40:00] and God called him to be a worship
[2:40:03] Warrior
[2:40:06] now Ben it'll make every devil in hell
[2:40:08] mad
[2:40:09] but you're not here to please them to
[2:40:11] start off with
[2:40:14] because God built you
[2:40:17] like he built them
[2:40:20] to display his work
[2:40:22] and then you see the gift of God
[2:40:26] in operation
[2:40:29] oh my brother Ron I recognize your gift
[2:40:31] as brother Branham
[2:40:33] well God didn't leave it all just for
[2:40:34] brother Brian
[2:40:39] he gave you gifts
[2:40:42] and maybe yours is not Ben's because we
[2:40:44] don't want to be somebody else
[2:40:47] but when you hear a guy like Ben
[2:40:51] maybe my boy at home
[2:40:54] I've kind of been like brother Ray's
[2:40:56] situation brother Wayne's
[2:40:59] I got a young pastor at home too
[2:41:03] his name's Andrew
[2:41:04] some of you met him
[2:41:06] some of you probably like him
[2:41:09] yeah
[2:41:13] but when he takes the pulpit he's kind
[2:41:14] of like this guy over here and he just
[2:41:16] starts singing and he creates an
[2:41:18] atmosphere
[2:41:22] I wanna I wanna come to the end of this
[2:41:24] just a moment God's got purpose for guys
[2:41:26] like this
[2:41:29] because when they create an atmosphere
[2:41:32] you don't realize it but thousands of
[2:41:34] angels have come to worship with you
[2:41:37] [Music]
[2:41:39] and then you engage them to worship
[2:41:43] because Worthy is the Lamb
[2:41:47] and you're singing more than just
[2:41:49] inspired words
[2:41:51] amen but those words are going out of
[2:41:53] your lips Like a Prayer
[2:41:57] and you begin to worship and go into
[2:41:59] another Realm
[2:42:01] and then your worship takes on a
[2:42:03] different element
[2:42:05] because you may feel like dirt
[2:42:09] but you're creating an atmosphere for
[2:42:11] the master
[2:42:14] and you're stirring up that God that's
[2:42:16] on the inside of you
[2:42:19] and as you worship
[2:42:21] you worship
[2:42:23] because he built you to worship
[2:42:26] these are just buildings
[2:42:28] those are just pews
[2:42:31] but that which he designed you to be
[2:42:34] nobody worships like you
[2:42:42] maybe I can touch that a little bit more
[2:42:46] how do you know when you get that soul
[2:42:47] mate
[2:42:49] even science tells us that her giggle
[2:42:53] will calm you
[2:42:58] because you stepped out of Eternity
[2:43:01] in the time
[2:43:06] and I pray with all my prayers
[2:43:08] [Music]
[2:43:10] that she and I can step back into
[2:43:13] eternity again
[2:43:17] but if I get ahead
[2:43:20] I'll be standing waiting
[2:43:24] if I get ahead of you
[2:43:26] when you cross
[2:43:29] I'll be your best day manner
[2:43:30] [Music]
[2:43:33] oh what a God we have
[2:43:35] could we worship him a little bit
