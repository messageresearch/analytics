[30:10] fundraisings I think they just had the
[30:12] mums that they did and amen I got
[30:14] involved in that I like those Ms and but

[31:25] and sister Destiny I don't know where
[31:27] they are they're usually on this side so
[31:29] they're back there in the back amen uh
[31:32] sorry about the seating it all changes
[31:34] doesn't it amen that's a good problem to
[31:36] have amen so Brother Richard also
[31:40] because of the way the seating is we
[31:42] have a Bible study that the young people
[31:44] go to Just prior and during the first
[31:48] part of the service and we had a problem
[31:50] is some of these young guys and some of
[31:52] these young girls that were going to
[31:53] Bible study when they come out they
[31:54] don't have a seat so if you come out now
[31:57] and you see a little sign laying in a
[31:58] seat and says this seat belongs to Ella
[32:01] Ericson she's in Bible study don't get
[32:03] upset at Ella that's just the way we
[32:05] come up with the try to uh to to let
[32:08] them both be in Bible study and no you
[32:11] can't get one of them for
[32:16] everybody I seen you look at me David
[32:18] David's like
[32:23] H you got to come early for Bible study
[32:26] get one and then and there's a age limit
[32:28] on Bible study so it's we so but uh so
[32:33] it is it is a real honor that Destiny
[32:35] and Austin uh are here with us as a part
[32:37] of this assembly it's a it's a great
[32:39] honor to have them their parents uh his

[36:01] commit this in the name of Jesus Christ
[36:04] we thank you for it father amen and amen
[36:09] amen maybe just one
[36:16] [Music]
[36:43] amen Caleb was a mighty warrior wasn't
[36:46] he I remember the first time I got this
[36:49] studying on Caleb and when Moses gave
[36:52] him property he counted it as a title
[36:56] deed amen he didn't have a piece of
[36:58] paper but he had Moses's words he could
[37:00] have it you know and when I found out he
[37:02] was a
[37:03] gentile and that he was able to get into
[37:06] the promise through the tribe of
[37:08] Judah well I tell you that was shouting
[37:11] material right there amen cuz that's
[37:13] exactly how this Gentile Church got into
[37:15] the promises of God it was through that
[37:17] tribe of Judah amen y'all know that
[37:20] Judah amen that that's that's the one
[37:22] that Rahab married into right she
[37:24] married into it and that's the tribe of
[37:26] praise and that's the reason I believe
[37:29] that praise comes so easily to the
[37:31] Gentile church and when the Bible speaks
[37:34] of the Tabernacle of David being lifted
[37:36] up again it was a tabernacle of praise
[37:39] and I believe this morning what a what a
[37:41] beautiful time to praise the Lord
[37:43] whatever season you're in whatever time
[37:45] in your life it's always a good time to
[37:48] praise the Lord amen can we just stand
[37:50] to our feet this morning and we're going
[37:52] to invite Brother David to come amen and
[37:55] we trust the Lord has has uh done
[37:58] something Mighty for you already this
[38:00] weekend but we're just praying that his
[38:02] Spirit might just say something this
[38:04] morning to to bring that to that very
[38:08] moment you know
[38:12] uh uh Friday night one of the brothers
[38:15] came by to to me there and he said uh he
[38:18] said I was watching Brother David preach
[38:20] there and he said I had just told my
[38:23] family about Moses meeting that burning
[38:26] bush
[38:27] and he said when that guy was up there
[38:29] preaching he said I seen a man on fire
[38:32] he said I was telling my family to watch
[38:34] that burning bush preach again amen I
[38:37] thought is that that's powerful thought
[38:39] amen and amen and he happened to his
[38:42] name was Brother David too amen so we're
[38:45] going to invite a burning bush to the
[38:47] platform this morning amen and we ask

[42:39] morning I know Satan isy is is trying to
[42:42] do
[42:43] everything to stop us from giving praise

[42:51] night may be if The Nightingales just
[42:54] see a star he has to worship
[42:58] and if you ask the little star why are
[43:00] you shining I am shining because the sun

[43:55] box amen he says an oldfashioned kind
[43:58] meeting revivalist it's not them people

[44:18] Ghost Church that when they see the
[44:21] first ray of
[44:24] light Glory Glory Glory when they see
[44:27] the first ray of light they ring out the
[44:30] Praises of God hallelujah oh and he said
[44:35] if they could hold their peace these
[44:38] rocks will cry
[44:40] out I often tell the Saints who wants to
[44:43] be replaced by a
[44:45] rock not
[44:47] me God gave me these vocal
[44:51] cords and like David would say
[44:54] everything how many do we have people
[44:55] here that are breeding
[44:58] but everything that have breath praise

[45:33] to thank you for being a blessing to me

[45:46] years back said oh my that's the church
[45:50] we want to be
[45:51] it I say that in all
[45:54] honesty you know why I love to
[45:57] worship not just making noise not just
[46:00] an emotion but a reality amen because
[46:03] the pure word is being spoken and
[46:06] there's something on the inside saying
[46:08] amen and the more I praise the more I
[46:11] water the word with praise the more the
[46:14] word changes
[46:17] me amen so certainly it's a great honor

[47:09] night
[47:11] my you know every moment we spend in the
[47:14] presence of the
[47:17] Lord we should be so
[47:20] thankful because the prophet tells us
[47:22] when the last one comes
[47:24] in when the Rapture will take place then
[47:28] the holy spirit will be taken think of
[47:31] it people will still preach the
[47:38] message they will even preach the
[47:41] Rapture but it will be over so every
[47:44] moment we have that we can spend in the
[47:48] presence of the
[47:50] Lord is a privilege a Grace that God
[47:53] gives us so this morning amen we want to
[47:57] take our time and see how the Lord leads
[48:00] amen uh if we can open our Bibles to
[48:03] Romans
[48:09] 8 just going to read one
[48:12] verse Verse
[48:19] 18 say Amen when you're there
[48:24] amen for I reckon that the sufferings of
[48:28] this present time are not worthy to be
[48:31] compared with the glory which shall be
[48:35] revealed in
[48:37] us how many can say Amen to that am but
[48:41] the David I'm going through a hard
[48:44] time
[48:46] yes there's no trial above what you can
[48:51] take and through the trial God gives you
[48:55] strength but it's not comparable to the
[48:58] glory that God will reveal in
[49:03] us
[49:05] hallelujah second Peter
[49:12] 1 verse
[49:24] three according as his divine power had
[49:28] given unto us all things that pertain
[49:31] unto life and godliness through the
[49:34] knowledge of him that had called us to
[49:36] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[49:39] us exceeding great and precious promises
[49:44] that by these ye might be partakers of
[49:47] the divine nature having escaped the
[49:50] corruption that is in the world through
[49:53] lust so God has the desire for us to be
[49:56] part
[49:58] partakers I love that word one final
[50:02] scripture in
[50:06] Isaiah
[50:08] 16 verse 1 and
[50:11] two the lord gave me that yesterday
[50:16] afternoon so by God's grace we just
[50:19] going to
[50:20] continue you know that's what God does
[50:23] it's perfect you know brother Ron
[50:26] Brother David or I've been with brother
[50:28] Wayne on on the field and and it's not
[50:32] let's talk and and see what we can
[50:34] preach
[50:35] on so this is not an orchestration by
[50:39] man but it's an orchestration by
[50:42] God Amen so the lord gave me and we're
[50:45] going to speak on that this morning so
[50:48] Isaiah 60 arise Shine for thy light is
[50:53] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[50:56] upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall
[50:59] cover the Earth and grows Darkness the
[51:02] people but the Lord shall arise upon
[51:06] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[51:11] thee may God add the blessing to the
[51:14] reading of his word let's bow our heads
[51:16] dear heavenly
[51:18] father Lord once again Lord we want to
[51:21] say thank you Father for the privilege
[51:23] you gave us Lord to be gathered here and
[51:26] to be standing on Holy Ground because
[51:29] you said there where two or three are
[51:30] gathered in your name you are with us so
[51:34] father we pray L May you take full
[51:36] control now of the service Lord may you
[51:39] anoint the speaker may you anoint the
[51:41] hearer Lord those that are present those
[51:44] that are streaming father you know each
[51:46] and every one father and Lord God I pray
[51:49] Lord as the word is going forward Lord
[51:52] may you give a deeper Revelation to each
[51:55] and everyone father to what your plan is
[51:57] for our lives and father Lord may we as
[52:01] the word goes forward Lord just worship
[52:04] you in spirit and in truth so that this
[52:07] word father transforms us from glory to
[52:11] glory Lord I pray may you bless the
[52:13] pastor brother Wayne may you bless the
[52:16] Elder may you bless the officers Lord
[52:18] may you bless the whole church Lord God
[52:20] lord how what a blessing they are father
[52:23] so not just locally father but the bride
[52:26] around the world so father we thank you
[52:29] for your goodness so may you take
[52:32] everything under your control we ask
[52:34] these things in the wonderful name of
[52:35] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen you
[52:39] may be
[52:42] seated so brother Ron he spoke yesterday
[52:46] amen I love his title not only the
[52:50] title amen but I I do like when when
[52:54] when I prepare a sermon to have a good
[52:55] title so
[52:57] you know brother R he says sight into an
[53:00] unseen real amen so he he was speaking
[53:04] how you know it wasn't a Christmas
[53:07] sermon we know we're getting closer to
[53:10] Christmas and that's just a day we put
[53:12] aside we know it wasn't Christmas you
[53:14] you've been taught well amen but he he
[53:17] mentioned it's a season of
[53:20] light and although there's gross
[53:23] Darkness upon the Earth the word of God
[53:25] tells us that the glory of God will be
[53:28] revealed in us so God has a plan and by
[53:32] God's grace we're going to see what
[53:34] God's plan is just like I said Friday
[53:37] because when the bride knows amen who
[53:39] she
[53:41] is so there's something about realizing
[53:45] what we are doing here right now and
[53:48] what's God's plan is for our lives amen
[53:51] so this is a season season of light we
[53:54] can look around and people they put nice
[53:57] lights everywhere cuz we're getting
[53:59] close to Christmas and and they forgot
[54:01] the real meaning of the light amen so
[54:04] it's the same in Europe amen but God's
[54:08] light amen the prophet says that's his
[54:11] word amen th thy light is a word that
[54:15] will guide me in everything amen so
[54:18] light was
[54:20] born a Christmas day amen so we know
[54:25] without life
[54:27] when he said let there be light that was
[54:30] God's word so without light amen the
[54:33] Esther's there's no
[54:37] life without
[54:40] sunlight we wouldn't have any plants the
[54:44] greenhouse we can give all we can all
[54:47] the vitamins but without the
[54:51] sunlight there wouldn't be any nice
[54:53] flowers any plants any vegetables
[54:57] nothing no
[54:59] existence so everything on our planet
[55:02] depends on the sun rising every
[55:05] day and producing its energy
[55:11] raise now that's the natural now what
[55:14] about the
[55:16] spiritual the raise of the s o
[55:20] n that brings the seed to
[55:23] maturity that's why we need to ripen
[55:26] under the presence of the s o
[55:29] n and that's what is going on right now
[55:33] I don't want to go ahead of myself amen
[55:35] so the prophet says what is light is the
[55:38] Vindicated spoken word of
[55:43] God Amen so let the light shine this
[55:46] morning amen so we see as I as I Was
[55:49] preparing amen as a title I forgot my
[55:54] title we are walking
[55:57] in this spoken word
[56:03] vision and I was thinking brother
[56:05] brother Ron gave several testimonies of
[56:08] our precious brother Ed amen who who had
[56:11] a privilege to to to be with brother
[56:13] Brandon amen and experience amen the the
[56:16] reality of
[56:19] God Amen I remember as he he told me
[56:23] personally the the the the the testimony
[56:26] of how he was hunting with with brother
[56:28] brandham and and and there was a
[56:33] vision and brother brother ad didn't
[56:35] even realize he was in the
[56:38] vision his wife precious sister Ruth
[56:42] prepared his
[56:43] bag amen and here brother brother Bram
[56:46] tells and and and this will happen and
[56:48] that will happen and something happened
[56:51] that brother Ed had to change his
[56:55] shirt you see how God orchestrate
[56:59] things he didn't realize it when he woke
[57:04] up and all of a sudden he goes goes in
[57:07] the back takes out a shirt puts it on
[57:11] and there's a green Checker
[57:15] chur
[57:16] Hallelujah he was walking in division
[57:19] right
[57:19] then and nothing can stop the word of
[57:23] God from manifesting
[57:26] amen so well Brother David what does
[57:28] this has to do with us okay no problem
[57:31] we'll get there let me give you another
[57:34] spoken word Vision amen pertaining to us
[57:37] amen I told you and the Bible is full of
[57:40] types that's why when the word was being
[57:43] open Amen brother brand says this book
[57:45] has become a new Bible amen he saw every
[57:49] type Christ and his bride amen and we
[57:52] see how elaser
[57:56] amen how eleazer he had to go amen
[58:00] Abraham calls him and say I want for
[58:03] Isaac I
[58:04] want a a precious
[58:08] bride I don't want those girls from no I
[58:12] want a pure virtuous
[58:17] bride so we see we can you can read it
[58:19] and I want it's a sermon in itself but
[58:21] how amen how he made uh an oath
[58:26] think of it elazer in the Bible you can
[58:29] read it he had to put his hands under
[58:31] his thigh amen
[58:34] meaning it was a sign
[58:37] of
[58:39] surrender a sign of submission even
[58:43] Jacob did the same thing when he made
[58:45] the oath with his son Joseph that I
[58:48] don't want to be buried there I want to
[58:50] be buried in canadan so it was a type
[58:54] you know what it also represent
[58:56] that under the tie it was considered the
[58:59] source of post
[59:02] posterity
[59:05] life if you surrender he is our
[59:09] head and if we surrender life will flow
[59:15] freely so we see how elaser has to go
[59:19] amen think of it naturally you go to a
[59:25] country and you need to find a
[59:27] bride and there's so many quotes and I
[59:30] don't want to go in there but I love it
[59:33] because while he's praying God is
[59:36] already moving because the prophet says
[59:38] that Rebecca came under the anointing of
[59:41] the
[59:44] spirit and here eleazer he he he prayed
[59:49] and then he prophesied because he spoke
[59:52] the word he said let the damsel that
[59:54] gives not only water to me but also to
[59:57] my camels let she be the elected
[1:00:02] lady amen so here because God works on
[1:00:06] both ends amen Here Comes Rebecca amen
[1:00:09] and how she says oh can I have a drink
[1:00:12] of water not only you but even your
[1:00:15] camels amen think of it 10 camels that's
[1:00:19] scripture 10 camel they they drink about
[1:00:22] I think about 50 gallons yeah m
[1:00:26] wow wow yeah that's times
[1:00:32] 10 now the prophet comes and he says
[1:00:35] that's that Beast represents a power and
[1:00:39] that same Beast that she watered with
[1:00:42] her praise is the power that will take
[1:00:45] her to her Heavenly home that will take
[1:00:48] her to her groom that's why Saints I'm
[1:00:51] not ashamed to worship my God because
[1:00:54] the more I worship Him in spirit and
[1:00:57] Truth something is happening that Satan
[1:01:00] can't see the world can't see but my God
[1:01:04] is transforming me amen that's why we
[1:01:07] are
[1:01:08] walking that was a type amen of Malachi
[1:01:12] 4 amen sent for the
[1:01:15] bride amen and then there when he came
[1:01:19] to Isaac there's no more question of
[1:01:22] elazer come on preach with me now it
[1:01:26] ain't about brother Branham it Ain it is
[1:01:28] all about Christ and the
[1:01:32] bride he did his job he did what he had
[1:01:35] to do according to the word but now it's
[1:01:38] up to us to manifest the word of
[1:01:43] God
[1:01:45] hallelujah Glory so yeah know I'm not
[1:01:48] ashamed of the Gospel amen you think I'm
[1:01:52] too excited I've got so much to be
[1:01:54] excited about he amen amen amen you know
[1:01:58] amen the prophet says we need more
[1:02:02] Moses with the burning bush to attract
[1:02:05] some of the other ones that are still
[1:02:07] out amen God is still alive God still
[1:02:12] performs Miracles amen people think amen
[1:02:16] God of the past God of brother brandham
[1:02:19] but let me tell you my Bible tells me
[1:02:22] that he's ashamed yesterday today and
[1:02:25] even
[1:02:27] tomorrow
[1:02:29] hallelujah amen amen amen so oh the only
[1:02:33] light comes from the
[1:02:39] word and we also know in the word that
[1:02:42] in the evening
[1:02:44] time you know what time we're living in
[1:02:47] we're in the end of the evening
[1:02:51] time and he said there will be light and
[1:02:54] there is light
[1:02:56] shining bright amen so we see God always
[1:03:02] God had attributes that he wanted to
[1:03:04] express the prophet tells us to become
[1:03:08] tangible so God he is an object of
[1:03:11] Praise of
[1:03:13] worship amen and even with Moses we can
[1:03:15] see I'm not going to end there go that's
[1:03:17] a whole series AP part but you take it
[1:03:20] that's for you
[1:03:22] Pastor we can see how Moses got
[1:03:25] instruction to build the Tabernacle amen
[1:03:28] and and there was a certain area so
[1:03:31] there was the outer Court the inner
[1:03:32] Court the holiest of
[1:03:36] holiest where God the light the shakina
[1:03:41] glory the prophet calls us the amber
[1:03:43] light the
[1:03:47] Halo amen we can see how it was
[1:03:53] veiled just like it's veiled today
[1:03:57] but real for his
[1:03:59] bride we see in Hebrews amen how he we
[1:04:03] know in the holiest of holies there's a
[1:04:04] golden sensor the Ark of the Covenant
[1:04:07] the Mana the Aaron's rod and I think I
[1:04:10] mentioned it Friday a dried up stick
[1:04:14] that produces
[1:04:18] fruit that's what has ask from from
[1:04:22] us not to copy not to do something
[1:04:26] manufacture something you know a sheep
[1:04:29] you don't have to ask it to produce
[1:04:34] wool do you where's brother Aiden let me
[1:04:38] put on my
[1:04:41] glasses I don't think you go in in the
[1:04:43] greenhouse and say now I want this type
[1:04:47] of flower so please let it be this type
[1:04:49] of
[1:04:52] flow he plants the seed he knows exactly
[1:04:56] what will come
[1:04:58] out so God planted a seed and he knows
[1:05:02] what will come
[1:05:04] out Satan tries to hybrid things he
[1:05:08] tries by all means but an apple tree
[1:05:11] will produce
[1:05:12] apples the tree of life will produce
[1:05:16] life come on and the tree of knowledge
[1:05:20] and wisdom will produce
[1:05:23] theology a dead Church a lukewarm church
[1:05:27] but the bride she's standing on the pure
[1:05:31] word of God and she knows amen she comes
[1:05:35] from God and goes back to God and she's
[1:05:38] walking right now present tense in the
[1:05:42] spoken word
[1:05:44] Vision Hallelujah and the more we walk
[1:05:47] the more we walk in the word who some
[1:05:50] glad morning when this life is over I
[1:05:54] will be changed in the twinkling of an
[1:05:56] eye oh
[1:05:58] Father Make It Real to each and every
[1:06:01] one of
[1:06:05] us
[1:06:07] hallelujah
[1:06:09] hallelujah so in Hebrews 9 amen it says
[1:06:13] verse eight the Holy Ghost this
[1:06:15] signifying that the way into the holiest
[1:06:17] of all was not yet made manifest so we
[1:06:20] see amen that means if you look it up in
[1:06:23] the in the concordance or the Lexicon
[1:06:25] amen to render apparance to appear to
[1:06:28] show but glory be to God Amen Seven Ages
[1:06:32] had to pass and now here at the last and
[1:06:36] final age there's no other
[1:06:40] age it ends with loudy and you know what
[1:06:43] the good news is I'm in the bride
[1:06:48] age but it ends with loud Des here so
[1:06:51] even though there can be gross Darkness
[1:06:53] upon the Earth hey God says when you
[1:06:57] have every born again son and daughter
[1:07:00] of God Amen you have something in you
[1:07:04] that you can go and create yourself
[1:07:07] another world and go live in it well
[1:07:10] start creating your world I go to school
[1:07:14] and you start worshiping Darkness hey
[1:07:17] has no effect on you loudy has no effect
[1:07:21] on you the world has no effect on you
[1:07:24] that's the power of
[1:07:27] God it ain't go somewhere on a nice
[1:07:30] Sandy
[1:07:32] Beach I know we all would love that
[1:07:35] especially the pastors and and I got a
[1:07:38] big amen
[1:07:40] there right bad news not
[1:07:44] yet we have a Heavenly Home
[1:07:47] awaiting amen but the Lord wants us to
[1:07:49] create the atmosphere no matter where we
[1:07:53] are amen even when Satan comes playing
[1:07:56] with your mind you answer him with
[1:07:58] faith when he comes with doubt you
[1:08:01] answer him with the word of
[1:08:03] God Amen and you see the power not of
[1:08:06] your word of his
[1:08:09] word amen amen so we see amen how it was
[1:08:14] veiled but God had this desire away from
[1:08:17] the beginning Amen to become tangible to
[1:08:20] manifest
[1:08:22] himself so nothing is out of cater
[1:08:26] are you hearing me nothing is going
[1:08:30] wrong amen and then the privilege was
[1:08:33] giving to the high priest Amen to go
[1:08:36] once a year amen the prophet tells us
[1:08:39] amen he's he was stripped and dressed
[1:08:43] right and he made us Kings and Priests
[1:08:47] so we need to be
[1:08:50] stripped I don't like it when brother
[1:08:52] Wayne or brother R when they you know
[1:08:54] they preach
[1:08:56] and and I think it's for
[1:08:58] me blessed are thou if you still hear
[1:09:02] the word of
[1:09:04] God because those that hear the truth
[1:09:07] and don't accept the truth amen they
[1:09:10] receive an hour and you know what they
[1:09:12] become spiritually
[1:09:15] deaf so if you hear the word and you
[1:09:18] feel like oh yes I need to put my life
[1:09:21] in order I need to run to the altar I
[1:09:24] need to ask forgiveness to this brother
[1:09:26] to that sister you better
[1:09:28] run amen I was hallelujah amen I was
[1:09:33] back in in maisha's Island this summer
[1:09:37] amen and as the word was being preached
[1:09:39] it ain't about Brother David no no no if
[1:09:42] you have that thought you're completely
[1:09:44] wrong it a it is all about our God
[1:09:48] because he still does the miraculous the
[1:09:51] phenomenal the Supernatural and the
[1:09:53] Supernatural is natural for God so while
[1:09:56] I was preaching the presence of the Lord
[1:09:58] filled the house and there were some I
[1:10:01] didn't know a thing about it there were
[1:10:03] some issues between
[1:10:05] families oh yeah even in maisha's
[1:10:09] Island not just in
[1:10:11] Ohio or Virginia or in tonan that's
[1:10:15] where we come
[1:10:16] from but the presence of the Lord was
[1:10:19] there amen and as God was dealing with
[1:10:22] the hearts all of a sudden a sister was
[1:10:24] running to another sister oh just
[1:10:28] embracing her please forgive
[1:10:32] me you think this is a man doing no this
[1:10:36] is God doing and he's the same for
[1:10:40] us come on church he can do exceeding
[1:10:44] above what you can think what you can
[1:10:47] imagine but all we sensor it enough to
[1:10:51] God's
[1:10:52] voice we need to be stripped
[1:10:55] and dressed right dressed in the
[1:10:58] righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready
[1:11:00] to enter in that man he walked in such a
[1:11:04] way that every time he
[1:11:10] moved it
[1:11:12] wasn't you've seen that brother he did
[1:11:16] this this this you've seen that sister
[1:11:20] oh she's still like this and this
[1:11:26] every step every movement of his life
[1:11:31] sir every time when he moved his
[1:11:41] legs you can move your leg no
[1:11:46] problem every time he made a step it had
[1:11:50] to play
[1:11:51] Holy Holy Holy unto to the Lord God
[1:11:57] Almighty my is that your
[1:12:01] testimony so we see when Jesus died on
[1:12:04] the day of atonement he rent the veil in
[1:12:09] two now for who that whosoever may come
[1:12:13] at any time into the shakina
[1:12:16] glory how by the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:20] Ghost many people think I have a nice
[1:12:23] sticker here I'm in the message I
[1:12:25] believe the message I'm in True Word
[1:12:29] Tabernacle I know brother
[1:12:33] Ray you better know Jesus Christ in the
[1:12:37] resurrection and the power of the
[1:12:39] Resurrection amen unless you have the
[1:12:41] token applied there's no Rapture for
[1:12:45] you amen but God still seals God is
[1:12:49] still in the sealing
[1:12:52] business hallelujah amen amen amen amen
[1:12:56] so that's why these meetings are so
[1:12:58] important let me say it even better
[1:13:00] every meeting is important because some
[1:13:03] people they are only living from special
[1:13:05] meeting to special meeting to special

[1:14:25] brother Brenham he says you know what
[1:14:27] Jesus Christ is walking on the front row
[1:14:29] with
[1:14:31] us so I feel good that it doesn't depend
[1:14:35] on my strength nor by might oh but by
[1:14:39] the spirit of the Lord this mountain
[1:14:42] shall be
[1:14:43] moved come on SO fear not little flock

[1:14:59] above our name the name of Jesus he says
[1:15:02] the veil of sin was rent into the veil
[1:15:05] of sickness was rent into and every Veil
[1:15:08] listen to that that kept man away from
[1:15:10] God was rent
[1:15:14] into we have no excuse
[1:15:18] whatsoever that's
[1:15:20] right whoever we are whether it's the
[1:15:23] first time you come in this in this in
[1:15:25] this church we have no excuse
[1:15:29] whatsoever we have received an Open Door
[1:15:34] an open
[1:15:35] book Hallelujah so the veil that kept
[1:15:38] man away from God was rented two amen
[1:15:40] and he scattered every devil he made a
[1:15:44] search light from
[1:15:47] Glory you want to know what the def
[1:15:49] definition is of search light a powerful
[1:15:52] beam of light that is projected a search
[1:15:54] light is an apparatus that combines an
[1:15:59] extremely luminous source with a
[1:16:01] mirrored parabolic
[1:16:05] reflector my my my you know why I get so
[1:16:08] excited because those words that you can
[1:16:11] find in a definition of Webster or
[1:16:13] whoever the prophet uses
[1:16:16] them and when you look it up you can but
[1:16:20] Rejoice because God Amen the night
[1:16:23] Andale I I spoke about he Rejoice
[1:16:25] because he sees just a little star but a
[1:16:28] little star has no light of himself but
[1:16:30] he reflects the light of the sun amen
[1:16:34] and God is asking us to reflect his
[1:16:37] light in this Dark Age that's why he
[1:16:40] said Darkness will cover the Earth but
[1:16:42] upon you and in you my glory shall be
[1:16:47] manifested and that's what's going on
[1:16:50] amen amen amen so he made a way with his
[1:16:53] own blood that
[1:16:56] whosoever whosoever will come amen and
[1:17:00] come into the shikina glory and be
[1:17:03] filled filled with what the power of
[1:17:09] Pentecost I'm not bringing you back to 9
[1:17:12] 1906 a soua street no the word of God
[1:17:17] brings us back to our
[1:17:20] origin that's when the first church was
[1:17:23] founded
[1:17:25] and even our
[1:17:28] blessed sister who found
[1:17:32] favor not our hell Mary and no she
[1:17:37] needed that kind of
[1:17:40] experience and we all need that kind of
[1:17:44] experience a lifechanging experience
[1:17:47] being born
[1:17:49] again amen amen amen oh and in that
[1:17:54] Glory sh
[1:17:56] Glory
[1:17:57] everything is
[1:18:01] possible the prophet says Jesus is
[1:18:06] here you're not hearing me brother
[1:18:09] brandham is
[1:18:11] saying to some
[1:18:16] people Jesus is standing
[1:18:19] here wearing a blue
[1:18:21] tie Brother David you consider yourself
[1:18:24] as Jesus
[1:18:25] I'm just quoting the
[1:18:29] word oh and people don't like you for
[1:18:32] that hey that's just quoting the word
[1:18:35] that doesn't make a God out of me like
[1:18:38] Oh Brother David no no don't go don't
[1:18:40] get into those
[1:18:42] doctrines but Jesus is stalking you
[1:18:44] every service through the vessel that
[1:18:46] God chose so if you don't like my tie oh
[1:18:50] don't look the veil people are looking
[1:18:52] to the veil and if you look to the fail
[1:18:55] you will see
[1:18:56] mistakes brother Brown wasn't
[1:19:00] perfect there's only one that is perfect
[1:19:03] and that's Jesus Christ and I can only
[1:19:06] be perfect by him and him
[1:19:12] alone the prophet says the shikina glory
[1:19:15] he reveals to the believer so we need to
[1:19:18] be a
[1:19:19] believer not a so-called believer not an
[1:19:23] unbeliever but a true
[1:19:25] believer and he that the Shina Glory
[1:19:28] reveals to the believer that he is the
[1:19:30] same yesterday today and
[1:19:33] forever come on
[1:19:36] now there is power in that
[1:19:41] light you know this Pillar of Fire when
[1:19:45] it came down you know God likes to
[1:19:48] change in morphe change his mask and he
[1:19:52] left something for the father final time
[1:19:56] at the end of the final age something
[1:20:00] real
[1:20:02] special are you with
[1:20:06] me that Pillar of Fire came between the
[1:20:09] Pharaoh the Army and his
[1:20:11] people and here
[1:20:14] Moses why do you cry Moses just
[1:20:18] speak so why do you cry speak the word
[1:20:22] of God until you believe it and you will
[1:20:25] see the miraculous happen amen Moses was
[1:20:28] just walking and he thought well I'm
[1:20:30] acting according to the word what he
[1:20:32] didn't see and thank God for Malachi 4
[1:20:35] amen he said out of that Pillar of Fire
[1:20:37] there were angry eyes and to see had to
[1:20:41] open so don't fear no matter what you
[1:20:44] face there's something with you on the
[1:20:46] front
[1:20:48] line amen when the prophet left us the
[1:20:51] pillar of fire didn't leave us
[1:20:56] God didn't leave us his work was done
[1:21:00] but now it's up to
[1:21:02] us and we walk day after day after
[1:21:06] day in the
[1:21:09] manifestation of the spoken word vision
[1:21:12] for me for
[1:21:14] us that's the say the
[1:21:17] word come on now but it takes the
[1:21:20] Simplicity of believing God that's right
[1:21:23] I love it simplicity
[1:21:25] people love to make
[1:21:28] complicated only believe and you'll see
[1:21:31] his glory amen we see how the temple
[1:21:34] amen when Solomon when they dedicated
[1:21:36] the temple amen we know how the glory of
[1:21:40] God filled the house now what house will
[1:21:44] you build
[1:21:45] me
[1:21:47] mhm Amen brother BR says why don't we
[1:21:50] dedicate ourselves to the worship of the
[1:21:53] Living God and let him fill us with
[1:21:59] himself and then we shall see the shik
[1:22:02] glory return again to the house of the
[1:22:05] Living God which is the human
[1:22:11] body but God is in plain view now it was
[1:22:15] death one time to walk behind that
[1:22:19] Veil and you know what it's death now
[1:22:22] not to go into be beyond that
[1:22:26] Veil and he says and now it's in plain
[1:22:29] view the revealed
[1:22:31] word my and people criticize the word PR
[1:22:35] criticize the revealed word amen and and
[1:22:38] people want to build kingdoms upon
[1:22:42] it make them a big ey and a small you
[1:22:45] and and I have a greater Revelation yeah
[1:22:48] I had people tell me that I said God
[1:22:50] bless you God gives a measure to each
[1:22:52] and everyone and I ask you one thing
[1:22:55] please pray for me that I may have a
[1:22:57] greater Revelation and that's my honest
[1:23:00] prayer that he reveals himself day after
[1:23:04] day after
[1:23:07] day
[1:23:09] hallelujah amen so we see now in Christ
[1:23:12] Jesus in Ephesians 2 ye who sometimes
[1:23:15] were far off are made nigh by the blood
[1:23:17] of Christ for he is our peace who had
[1:23:21] made both one and had broken down the m
[1:23:24] wall of partition between
[1:23:28] us we're going to celebrate Christmas
[1:23:32] soon no not me Brother
[1:23:35] David I'm not going to go into Pagan
[1:23:38] stuff don't
[1:23:43] worry the prophet tells us the true
[1:23:46] Christmas what is it having Christ
[1:23:50] Living in
[1:23:52] you and he's the one we worship so Jesus
[1:23:55] took his own blood and entered into the
[1:23:56] holiest of holies to redeem us and to
[1:23:59] tear down the middle wall of petition
[1:24:02] that you yourself might come into the
[1:24:04] shikina glory with him and live under
[1:24:07] the blessings of
[1:24:09] God come on Church Redeemed by the blood
[1:24:13] and when the True Blood came the blood
[1:24:15] of Jesus Christ God's son he broke down
[1:24:17] the middle wall of petition he tore down
[1:24:20] the curtain from top to bottom showing
[1:24:24] it wasn't a man doing
[1:24:28] it amen he tore down the curtain from
[1:24:31] top to Bon and now the believer
[1:24:34] whosoever will he can come into the
[1:24:36] shikina glory that's why he says we have
[1:24:39] some untapped
[1:24:42] resources but it's about time we go
[1:24:45] Beyond the Veil and we start pulling the
[1:24:48] dividends that God purchased for us
[1:24:55] if you don't know what a dividend
[1:24:57] is ask somebody who
[1:25:02] knows I'll put it simple a shareholder
[1:25:05] he only wants
[1:25:06] dividends you got it right
[1:25:10] okay we've got unta resources that are
[1:25:16] unlimited
[1:25:18] unlimited amen we thank God you know
[1:25:21] people they w't put God in a box
[1:25:27] untapped resources that means every time
[1:25:31] are you hearing
[1:25:32] me old and young every time you come to
[1:25:38] God you can get what you
[1:25:42] need if you can believe he
[1:25:46] says yeah Satan plays with our
[1:25:49] mind but as the word is being spoken we
[1:25:52] receive fate is being built when God
[1:25:56] send us a restored word it's to give us
[1:25:59] perfect Faith that's why even brother
[1:26:01] Brandon says the Rapture will be an easy

[1:27:12] start writing a thesis a doctorate how
[1:27:17] it has to
[1:27:19] happen believe the
[1:27:21] word in all its power and was walking
[1:27:25] amen and every step he took took him
[1:27:27] higher and higher and higher because it
[1:27:30] pleased God to take him to Rapture him
[1:27:33] because he
[1:27:34] believed in God amen amen amen so we
[1:27:39] know amen he came the mercy seed is
[1:27:42] hanging in clear view of the
[1:27:44] congregation amen but now there are many
[1:27:47] that are under the popular
[1:27:50] opinion that's another word we like huh
[1:27:52] well I don't like it
[1:27:54] to be honest because you know brother
[1:27:57] Wayne what is the popular opinion on
[1:27:59] this
[1:28:01] subject serpent SE marriage and divorce
[1:28:05] and going to stop there
[1:28:07] but what's the popular
[1:28:10] opinion we don't want the popular
[1:28:13] opinion we want What God Says amen let
[1:28:16] every every word from a man be a liar
[1:28:19] but God's word be the only
[1:28:23] truth
[1:28:24] amen so we don't want a popular opinion
[1:28:27] we want to stand on what is
[1:28:29] right if you want to be blessed in your
[1:28:31] life stand live according to the word of
[1:28:35] God yes people people may be jealous
[1:28:38] about
[1:28:41] it but who
[1:28:44] cares what God has blessed nobody can
[1:28:48] curse hey people look at Israel and say
[1:28:52] oh Israel this this this this this God
[1:28:55] has blessed who can
[1:28:59] curse amen since the Holy Ghost has come
[1:29:01] in his last days as prophesied the veil
[1:29:04] is rent amen and that's why we can see
[1:29:08] the extreme joy and peace extreme
[1:29:12] joy come on how many are happy this

[1:29:17] day of the Lord let us rejoice and be

[1:29:28] buddy I'm going to preach longer
[1:29:34] oh don't
[1:29:39] worry you know there where the spirit of
[1:29:41] the Lord is there's liberty when we come
[1:29:44] into the house of God we should be under
[1:29:46] so much rejoicing you know people they
[1:29:49] wanton buy their tradition you have to
[1:29:51] do this you have to do that they
[1:29:53] shouldn't be D dancing there shouldn't
[1:29:55] be singing well let me tell you that's
[1:29:57] the LIE from hell because Satan he loves
[1:30:01] to keep people bound but when God is
[1:30:04] dealing with you I don't care if I act
[1:30:07] like a drunkard I don't care how I act
[1:30:11] there's a fire burning within
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:17] me that's why the prophet says I've seen
[1:30:21] nothing nothing this
[1:30:27] orderly I gave I think I spoke a brother
[1:30:31] Tim the same when I was a Marius amen
[1:30:33] sister Jessica Adams before I came up
[1:30:37] she sung the song uh How does it go in
[1:30:42] Jesus name uh we I speak Jesus thank you
[1:30:47] I speak Jesus the anointing came down I
[1:30:50] couldn't even preach I just under the
[1:30:52] anointing orted God's people all of a
[1:30:55] sudden amen my mind went to the
[1:30:58] scripture amen quoting Joshua amen how
[1:31:01] they had to go around and there was
[1:31:04] silence yes there was but at a point of
[1:31:08] time at a point of time there was true
[1:31:12] worship amen and I started going around
[1:31:15] I'll do it again I started going around
[1:31:18] the there was an a tent so I just walked
[1:31:21] around and you know what there was such
[1:31:23] an anointing
[1:31:24] oh well you can say they're young people
[1:31:26] but they all ran and they kept on
[1:31:29] walking worshiping oh they received the
[1:31:32] Holy Ghost they received their healing
[1:31:35] they received their
[1:31:37] Deliverance do you think because it was
[1:31:39] just a type or because Brother David
[1:31:41] Just sh
[1:31:43] no because somebody took God at his
[1:31:50] word and people think oh you're acting
[1:31:53] crazy what let me be crazy about
[1:31:59] God
[1:32:01] hallelujah God amen amen amen this
[1:32:04] extreme
[1:32:06] joy
[1:32:08] woo we should have faces like
[1:32:14] this in
[1:32:17] the fiery
[1:32:19] furnace
[1:32:22] yes are you with
[1:32:24] me because even brother brandham he he
[1:32:27] goes he goes to the back mind of Christ
[1:32:29] you know of God and and what does he say
[1:32:32] Here Comes Gabriel have you
[1:32:34] seen your three
[1:32:36] sons they're going to be burned oh yeah
[1:32:39] I'm
[1:32:40] watching have you seen brothers so and
[1:32:42] so sister so oh yeah my eyes are on this
[1:32:46] parrow but my eyes are on my
[1:32:50] bride now let me go and destroy the
[1:32:53] Earth

[1:32:56] sometimes you know let me do this and
[1:32:57] let me do
[1:33:02] that I know I'm I I'm hitting some
[1:33:05] things
[1:33:08] here don't blame the
[1:33:12] mailman the message comes from
[1:33:16] God but you know what God says this is a
[1:33:19] man-sized
[1:33:22] job I'm going to go
[1:33:25] down and that's exactly what happened in
[1:33:28] our
[1:33:29] generation come on now I'm going to come
[1:33:32] down reveal myself to my
[1:33:36] bride and the prophet says and they had
[1:33:39] hours of hours of
[1:33:41] rejoicing think of it in the in the fire
[1:33:45] that was heated up seven times
[1:33:49] stronger you want to know the
[1:33:52] power of the light
[1:33:55] which is
[1:33:56] God the only thing that was burned you
[1:33:58] know was
[1:34:00] there GI
[1:34:03] bondage the power of God is so that even
[1:34:07] their clothes didn't
[1:34:11] smell oh come on now come on now amen
[1:34:16] that's the power of God here this
[1:34:22] morning that's why we have extreme joy
[1:34:25] and peace and things that the church has
[1:34:29] today we have it today it's in plain
[1:34:33] view of those who
[1:34:37] believe Hallelujah that's why I don't
[1:34:40] know who was talking because it was the
[1:34:42] same
[1:34:43] language that was with the brothers I
[1:34:45] think you know I said well I don't need
[1:34:48] lot of language on that but in our
[1:34:50] language it says you're cuckoo
[1:34:54] so it was just a sign and people think
[1:34:56] when somebody is is is under the
[1:34:58] anointing of
[1:35:01] God or somebody who testifies I'm Healed
[1:35:05] and still has a
[1:35:06] leg or sorry brother one somebody who
[1:35:10] testifies service after service every
[1:35:14] Sunday morning I love his testimony God
[1:35:16] bless you Sister Carnie where every
[1:35:18] Sunday morning yes his body says I can't
[1:35:26] but something within
[1:35:28] him I'm going to destroy
[1:35:31] Satan in the name of Jesus and here he
[1:35:35] comes he he can be sick even before
[1:35:38] going behind a Pulpit I'm not saying
[1:35:40] that to have pity I'm just saying that
[1:35:41] to show the glory of God in a
[1:35:44] surrendered vessel amen that goes behind
[1:35:46] a Pulpit Satan even before he opens the
[1:35:50] door let's let's give him another one
[1:35:52] but here he goes
[1:35:56] and the anointing comes
[1:35:59] down and people are saved people are
[1:36:02] healed people are
[1:36:04] delivered amen and he's the same God for
[1:36:07] us this
[1:36:09] morning it all depends on if we
[1:36:12] believe if we believe for the impossible
[1:36:15] because all things are possible to them
[1:36:18] that
[1:36:20] believe amen amen amen so we're living
[1:36:24] amen as my title says we're walking in
[1:36:27] the spoken word Vision so now as I said
[1:36:30] on Friday Satan perverts
[1:36:37] everything listen to how many know Tik
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:43] Tok come on let me put on my
[1:36:47] glasses that doesn't make me an old man
[1:36:49] huh sorry how many know Tik Tok yeah I
[1:36:53] don't have it just so you know but I
[1:36:56] know about it nobody dares how comes I
[1:36:59] mean have you preached against it
[1:37:03] brother you did well brother
[1:37:10] Wayne
[1:37:15] okay so for those who don't
[1:37:19] know Tik Tok is a social media I'm not
[1:37:23] going to preach on that but I'm going to
[1:37:25] make a link here
[1:37:27] wait for creating and sharing this
[1:37:31] discovering all types short
[1:37:33] videos and the
[1:37:35] name it they play on Tik Tok is that's a
[1:37:39] complicated word I'm going to say now an
[1:37:52] onomo it's stands for clocks and
[1:37:55] countdowns minute by minute so onom
[1:37:57] matopo is a word that sounds like the
[1:38:01] noise it
[1:38:03] describes Tick
[1:38:06] Tock and as I said before and people oh
[1:38:09] I have so many
[1:38:10] followers MH I'm an influencer and so
[1:38:15] on but we see the prophet says in the
[1:38:17] countdown the spiritual astronaut is in
[1:38:20] Christ and he's listening to the word of
[1:38:25] God not Tick
[1:38:34] Tock listen to the countdown of the word
[1:38:37] of God and to see where it's going and
[1:38:41] he's fixing to leave now not for the
[1:38:44] moon he will pass the moon so fast he's
[1:38:47] on his road to heaven and he's listening
[1:38:49] to the countdown oh yes he's headed for
[1:38:52] heaven in a Raptor oh he's in Christ
[1:38:55] he's wrapped in his glory headed for
[1:38:58] heaven with him and leave the
[1:39:03] Earth let's get in the astronaut very
[1:39:07] quickly because the doors will close
[1:39:09] after a while the countdown's on science
[1:39:13] says that their countdown is three
[1:39:15] minutes listen he says that in 62 is
[1:39:18] three
[1:39:19] minutes hours may be ahead of that it
[1:39:22] might be one ready for 4 Z let's come in
[1:39:25] so
[1:39:26] now Satan scientist they all heard about
[1:39:31] the Doomsday
[1:39:32] Clock
[1:39:34] yeah it started in
[1:39:37] 1947 after the Cold War so it's a clock
[1:39:41] where so-call intelligent
[1:39:45] people with all due respect I say
[1:39:49] that but there's only one intelligence
[1:39:54] that's let me just enter something
[1:39:56] here you know we are people are creating
[1:40:01] artificial
[1:40:03] intelligence it comes to such a point
[1:40:05] it's made by
[1:40:07] humans so even artificial intelligence
[1:40:11] started lying
[1:40:13] H why because they're tapping into this
[1:40:17] tree of
[1:40:19] knowledge instead of the Bride we the
[1:40:22] bride we should tap in this this this
[1:40:26] untapped resources in the tree of
[1:40:29] life amen so we see they make such a big
[1:40:32] fuss and and you know hey there's one
[1:40:36] intelligence and that's he and him
[1:40:42] alone that's why we should listen to the
[1:40:44] condam of the word amen so we see this
[1:40:47] Doomsday Clock amen started and now it's
[1:40:50] 90 seconds to midnight
[1:40:54] Satan always takes something out of the
[1:40:57] word and makes something out of it are
[1:41:01] you with me few more
[1:41:04] moments okay
[1:41:06] thanks as long there's this good bro I'm
[1:41:14] going
[1:41:15] midnight marks the beginning and the
[1:41:18] ending of a day are you with me what
[1:41:23] does the Bible say about
[1:41:26] midnight Exodus 11 I'm just going to
[1:41:28] give you some types and Moses said thus
[1:41:30] sayeth the Lord about midnight will I go
[1:41:33] out into the midst of Egypt let's
[1:41:35] continue Exodus 12 and it came to pass
[1:41:38] that at midnight the Lord smoted all the
[1:41:40] firstborn in the land of Egypt and from
[1:41:42] the firstborn of the Pharaoh that sat on
[1:41:44] his throne unto the firstborn of the
[1:41:46] captive that was in the dungeon and all
[1:41:48] the firstborn of the
[1:41:51] cattle judges 16 and Samson lay till
[1:41:55] midnight and arose at midnight and took
[1:41:58] the doors of the Gate of the city and
[1:41:59] the two posts and went away with them
[1:42:01] bar and all and put them upon his
[1:42:03] shoulder and carried them upon the top
[1:42:05] of the hill that is before heon and then
[1:42:08] Ruth another type come on now and it
[1:42:11] came to pass at midnight that the man
[1:42:13] was afraid and turned himself and behold
[1:42:15] the woman laid At His
[1:42:18] Feet act 16 and at midnight Paul and
[1:42:21] Silas prayed and sank praise unto God
[1:42:24] and the prisoners heard them and
[1:42:26] suddenly there was a great earthquake
[1:42:28] and so the foundation of the prisons
[1:42:30] were shaken and immediately all the
[1:42:32] doors were opened and everyone's bands
[1:42:35] were
[1:42:37] loosed come on church amen in the
[1:42:40] evening time we're so close to what they
[1:42:43] call
[1:42:45] midnight I'm not done yet with midnight
[1:42:47] I'm coming back to that but let's say a
[1:42:49] few moments with Paul and Silas amen as
[1:42:52] they were in
[1:42:57] prison Shadrach masak and
[1:43:00] Abednego they lived
[1:43:02] in what we could call Sodom and
[1:43:07] Gomorrah not quoting that they live
[1:43:10] there get me
[1:43:12] right but no matter what the
[1:43:15] circumstances
[1:43:16] were they decided they even changed
[1:43:19] their
[1:43:21] name to take their their true identity
[1:43:25] away but that couldn't change the
[1:43:29] identity that God plac there and that's
[1:43:33] the same for us in lyia young people and
[1:43:36] old people no matter how dark it may be
[1:43:39] the glory of God is upon thee and is
[1:43:42] revealed through
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:45] you so don't be afraid to worship Paul
[1:43:48] and Silas listen when we look when you
[1:43:51] when you look it up amen the word hymns
[1:43:54] the strong lexicon says whom that means
[1:43:57] to sing praise celebrating God they sung
[1:44:01] you know what they sung the Pascal hymns
[1:44:03] that's the Psalm 11318 136 and the Jews
[1:44:07] call that the great
[1:44:09] halel the word halel comes from praise
[1:44:13] it means
[1:44:17] Hallelujah and I I read the quote what
[1:44:19] brother Brenham says even the hot and
[1:44:21] tots amen they can use the word
[1:44:24] hallelujah which means glory to my God
[1:44:29] Amen so I should be afraid to scream on
[1:44:32] the top of my lungs the top of my voice
[1:44:35] Hallelujah because he is worthy of all
[1:44:38] my
[1:44:39] praise amen amen amen the exaltation
[1:44:43] praise ye the Lord hallelujah it comes
[1:44:45] from the Greek root Allelujah appears
[1:44:49] throughout all the Psalms amen and it
[1:44:51] means and the phrase it means to shine
[1:44:56] to praise to boast or celebrate
[1:45:05] God our true worship should be at the
[1:45:09] level of the miracle we
[1:45:17] expect because when I praise
[1:45:20] Hallelujah I can boast
[1:45:24] I love what brother brandham says I
[1:45:25] cannot boast on my family but there's
[1:45:27] one I can boast on and that's Jesus
[1:45:30] Christ and I'm not afraid to worship him
[1:45:34] I'm not afraid that's why he says we can
[1:45:37] face demons he said when he received the
[1:45:40] vision walking in the spoken word he
[1:45:42] said now Satan you can line up all you
[1:45:45] demons and you can sty to stop that
[1:45:48] little boy from Raising from the dead
[1:45:50] but nothing can stop the word of God
[1:45:53] from
[1:45:55] manifesting in me in
[1:45:58] us
[1:46:00] hallelujah amen so I'm not afraid to
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:06] boast what does it say p 113 praise ye
[1:46:10] the Lord Praise ye all ye Servants of
[1:46:12] the Lord praise the name of the
[1:46:16] Lord hey it's still
[1:46:20] early blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:46:22] from this time for and forever more from
[1:46:24] the rising of the sun until the going
[1:46:27] down of the same the lord's name is to
[1:46:29] be

[1:46:58] love me is he really good then he's
[1:47:02] worthy of my
[1:47:03] praise amen oh let Israel now say that
[1:47:06] his Mercy endured forever let them now
[1:47:09] not fear the lord say that his Mercy
[1:47:11] endured forever I called upon the Lord
[1:47:13] in distress and the Lord answered me and
[1:47:16] said me in a large place the Lord is on
[1:47:19] my
[1:47:21] side and I will not fear what can man do
[1:47:26] unto
[1:47:27] me think of it Paul and
[1:47:31] silus were sitting legs maybe you don't
[1:47:35] see me but that's okay and one time
[1:47:39] brother on remember we took a
[1:47:41] picture we visited I don't know where it
[1:47:44] was just how it was where wburg that's
[1:47:49] how they were and they just remembered
[1:47:53] hey Paul let's give glory to God let's
[1:47:57] start worshiping let's create an
[1:47:59] atmosphere in this place where even no
[1:48:03] matter how we can be
[1:48:05] bound looking through our eyes let us
[1:48:08] worship amen and they created an
[1:48:11] atmosphere and did you hear what they
[1:48:12] say amen for God is with me his Mercy
[1:48:16] endured forever what I was impr hey his
[1:48:19] Mercy endured forever they started
[1:48:22] worshiping and an earthquake came amen

[1:48:27] yes he can shake oh every Foundation
[1:48:31] amen every stronghold has to come
[1:48:35] down and it shook the whole house and it
[1:48:39] set them all at Liberty that's why when
[1:48:42] you worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:48:45] your neighbor can be boundless bound
[1:48:48] be but you worship will create an
[1:48:52] atmosphere here that all of a sudden he
[1:48:54] doesn't know what's going on but he
[1:48:57] feels the presence of the Lord amen
[1:49:01] hallelujah oh what's going on that's the
[1:49:04] power of
[1:49:07] God
[1:49:08] hallelujah amen Psalm 136 oh give thanks
[1:49:11] unto the Lord for he is
[1:49:14] good sir and his Mercy endured forever
[1:49:18] let's continue I don't want to all these
[1:49:20] are sermons in itself but
[1:49:23] Matthew
[1:49:24] 25 and at
[1:49:27] midnight there was a cry made behold the
[1:49:32] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet
[1:49:37] him at midnight there's a cry amen there
[1:49:41] may be foolish versions but there are
[1:49:43] some wise that have the oil the
[1:49:47] anointing the wine of stimulation and
[1:49:50] their lambs they full up like the
[1:49:53] prophet says we need to be filled up
[1:49:55] filled up till every
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:02] fiber
[1:50:03] hallelujah amen amen in China tick Tok
[1:50:08] amen is known as doing which means
[1:50:14] shaking
[1:50:17] sound look Satan is but a copier
[1:50:23] but let me tell you the word of God is a
[1:50:26] certain
[1:50:29] sound that will maybe shake you but will
[1:50:33] make you Rapture
[1:50:36] Ready because the sound of God's trumpet
[1:50:39] is a clear sound and when you hear that
[1:50:42] sound you will prepare for battle but if
[1:50:46] it's a confusion how can you be ready
[1:50:49] but this pure word has sounded mightily
[1:50:53] powerfully and the bride says it's
[1:50:56] nothing but the
[1:50:59] truth
[1:51:01] hallelujah God revealed his word to us
[1:51:05] amen listen amen we have a clear view of
[1:51:08] who he is of who we
[1:51:11] are the seals are
[1:51:14] open this is the most glorious time I'm
[1:51:17] not saying that just to say something
[1:51:20] it's a reality
[1:51:25] oh and when the seven seal opened there
[1:51:28] was silence for the David there silence
[1:51:32] well maybe for you brother or sister but
[1:51:34] not for me because the silence is broken
[1:51:38] because when the seals were opened seven
[1:51:41] Thunders uttered their voices amen
[1:51:43] everything that was a mystery amen was
[1:51:46] revealed so there's nobody coming to
[1:51:49] reveal something that was forgotten no
[1:51:52] no no Eleazar did his job well amen and
[1:51:55] God used the mouthpiece to speak to his
[1:51:58] bride so his bride can prepare herself
[1:52:02] what with the revealed
[1:52:04] word come on
[1:52:06] Saints Hallelujah so it's not a half an
[1:52:10] hour of silence for some it is but for
[1:52:12] the bride he's revealing his secrets to
[1:52:16] her amen people want to use that
[1:52:20] scripture sh has to be silence in
[1:52:26] church I'm so sick and tired of this
[1:52:31] demon because if you don't praise him if
[1:52:33] I don't praise him these stones will
[1:52:35] praise him God will find somebody that
[1:52:38] he can get praise out of and I just
[1:52:41] don't want to make noise I want to
[1:52:43] worship Him in spirit and in truth but
[1:52:45] when I see my true identity when I see
[1:52:49] that he gives me every Redemptive
[1:52:51] blessing every promise when I see my
[1:52:55] name in the book I can but glorify the
[1:52:57] name of
[1:52:59] Jesus
[1:53:02] Hallelujah
[1:53:07] Glory don't never be a dead
[1:53:16] Church
[1:53:19] hallelujah what did he Veil the word he
[1:53:23] says now let me take a few moments if
[1:53:26] that's okay for
[1:53:29] Esther is that
[1:53:34] okay I quoted I think Friday
[1:53:37] predestination looks back to fall
[1:53:39] knowledge fall knowledge looks at the
[1:53:42] destiny God in the beginning could see
[1:53:44] all things the way it would
[1:53:49] happen and he knew the end from the
[1:53:51] beginning that wonderful and to think
[1:53:54] that every Born Again child of God today
[1:53:57] has the privilege and Assurance to know
[1:53:59] that God knows his
[1:54:07] own we see and I'm not going to go into
[1:54:09] all the details that's another series
[1:54:11] brother Wayne and I know you preach on
[1:54:13] that
[1:54:16] too but we see how Esther was chosen for
[1:54:20] such a time as this
[1:54:23] sir just like this
[1:54:26] Esther is chosen for such a time as this
[1:54:30] so we see how amen we go through the
[1:54:33] whole story and and how amen Mari he
[1:54:38] says well if you be silent God will use
[1:54:42] somebody
[1:54:46] else so there goes all their
[1:54:49] theology against worship you know
[1:54:52] brother
[1:54:53] DAV it you should hear a KNE drop on the
[1:54:58] floor well I'm sorry if you want to hear
[1:55:01] that
[1:55:01] needle don't come to my church don't
[1:55:04] come to BR rain's Church don't come to
[1:55:05] BR Ron's
[1:55:09] church because people want to take
[1:55:12] something and to put God in a
[1:55:15] box so even Mari he says if you won't
[1:55:20] say a thing God will take somebody else
[1:55:22] else cuz God wants to be worshiped he
[1:55:25] wants to be worshiped amen and then we
[1:55:28] see how amen yeah the Amplified says if
[1:55:31] you keep silent at this
[1:55:35] time I'm going to bring it to our front
[1:55:37] door huh so the days of Silence are over
[1:55:41] we can Rejoice we have our name in the
[1:55:44] Lamb's Book of Life amen and it's not a
[1:55:47] revelation a man can give it's God
[1:55:49] himself giving us that Revelation that
[1:55:52] why the opening of the word is a jubilee
[1:55:55] is a Revival it's a wakeup
[1:56:02] call
[1:56:04] Hallelujah so he came down the head of
[1:56:07] the body to show us our position now
[1:56:10] listen
[1:56:12] Esther the theologians they say this
[1:56:15] book is
[1:56:17] useless because God isn't even
[1:56:20] mentioned in the Book of Esther
[1:56:23] so why why is it
[1:56:26] Esther let me tell you CU she's a type
[1:56:29] of
[1:56:31] us got to make it more clear the Book of
[1:56:34] Esther is right after the book of
[1:56:37] Nehemiah Nehemiah he represents the Jews
[1:56:40] going back to their
[1:56:43] Homeland and Esther is before the Book
[1:56:46] of
[1:56:47] Job job represents the resurrection I
[1:56:51] know my redeemer live it so after the
[1:56:54] Jews go to their Homeland and just
[1:56:57] before the resurrection there's a queen
[1:56:59] that comes to her rightful
[1:57:03] position come on Church you think that's
[1:57:06] just by chance no God knows he knows he
[1:57:12] says in the beginning was the word and
[1:57:13] the Word was God the word was with God
[1:57:16] that's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:57:25] Hallelujah then when she comes to the
[1:57:29] king she needed a
[1:57:32] scepter few more
[1:57:35] minutes the scepter of the king we can
[1:57:38] see in the Bible different verses you
[1:57:42] know a scepter could have different
[1:57:44] sizes but if it was pure
[1:57:47] gold gold is
[1:57:49] heavy either he had muscles like this
[1:57:52] or 20 people were holding his hands but
[1:57:55] that's not the case listen Bible says
[1:57:58] the scepter ordinary was made of
[1:58:02] wood of certain kind of vines or
[1:58:04] straight branches Etc so there was wood
[1:58:09] and
[1:58:10] gold we have the
[1:58:13] cross and
[1:58:17] deity without the cross we are
[1:58:20] lost and with with the cross we receive
[1:58:26] D talking about the privileged people
[1:58:28] Saints we are to be the most happiest
[1:58:32] people in the earth and that goes from
[1:58:35] Ohio to Virginia to France to
[1:58:37] Switzerland to Germany to China to Japan
[1:58:40] amen the bride ought to be the happiest
[1:58:44] [Music]
[1:58:45] people well let's act upon according to
[1:58:49] the word he became sin like me that I
[1:58:52] might become righteousness of God he
[1:58:56] took my place that I can take his
[1:59:01] now
[1:59:02] Hallelujah isn't he wonderful we live in
[1:59:05] a Time Saints Amen brother Bram had
[1:59:08] seven
[1:59:09] Visions six are already done amen the
[1:59:13] prophet and again people try to put amen
[1:59:16] says the word of God and put God in a
[1:59:19] box the sixth vision is
[1:59:22] over is manifested the seven is only
[1:59:26] remaining and I saw ashes I saw the
[1:59:30] destruction of America that's the only
[1:59:33] remaining but before that there's a
[1:59:35] Rapture taking
[1:59:37] place the prophet says about these
[1:59:39] Visions amen the Catholic oh they
[1:59:42] already in the White
[1:59:48] House it struck me when the president to
[1:59:53] be said all the Catholics should vote
[1:59:56] for me what a declaration what also
[2:00:00] struck me well not struck me I just see
[2:00:02] the we're walking in the
[2:00:06] manifestation the spoken word
[2:00:09] Vision now last week he went to
[2:00:12] Paris to what to
[2:00:16] nraam do you think that's just a
[2:00:20] coincidence oh God still has control
[2:00:23] over everything even in Russia even in
[2:00:26] Israel even in Sy everywhere God knows
[2:00:30] and there's nothing out of cader God
[2:00:32] knows exactly and he will manifest every
[2:00:36] single
[2:00:40] word amen amen isn't that something amen
[2:00:43] so that's why we can give him glory
[2:00:46] Saints because we are a privileged
[2:00:49] people amen so there's nothing going to
[2:00:52] stop it there will be light in the
[2:00:53] evening time I don't care listen how he
[2:00:56] says it the works that I do you shall
[2:00:58] also
[2:01:02] do I love that it's probably only for
[2:01:04] brother Ron and brother Wayne and
[2:01:07] brother Ray but for me no did he say
[2:01:11] that I could get a better know than that
[2:01:14] did he say
[2:01:16] that he said the works that I do shall
[2:01:19] ye do also
[2:01:23] he says I don't care how many seals you
[2:01:27] try to put over
[2:01:30] it God will break every seal he broke
[2:01:34] the Seal of the Tomb he broke the Seal
[2:01:36] of hell he broke the Seal of death he
[2:01:39] broke the Seal of the grave and arose
[2:01:41] forever more and triumphant over the
[2:01:44] grave that hell tombs and every manmade
[2:01:48] thing there
[2:01:49] was I love the end part
[2:01:52] to show that he was God and cannot be
[2:01:56] sealed away from the
[2:02:00] people
[2:02:02] hallelujah glory be to God he cannot be
[2:02:06] sealed away from the people
[2:02:09] anymore people
[2:02:12] try I have a special Ministry because
[2:02:15] you know I'm coming after brother
[2:02:16] brandham and you should I'll make more
[2:02:19] sense to this word and
[2:02:22] you take one word you add one word it is
[2:02:26] finished amen that's why God himself
[2:02:29] says you can't seal me away any longer I
[2:02:34] am here the I am came down for his bride
[2:02:38] to show who she is and she accepts it
[2:02:41] willingly gladly
[2:02:45] rejoicing glory amen that shows we are
[2:02:49] invited Amen to be part Akers of all
[2:02:53] that he
[2:02:56] is
[2:02:59] partakers you know what that means that
[2:03:02] means we
[2:03:05] participate we take part
[2:03:08] of we are in the
[2:03:11] picture where Satan is out of the
[2:03:16] picture although brother Ron said yeah
[2:03:18] there's a picture taken and he will be
[2:03:19] held responsible that's true
[2:03:22] but he's out of the picture says the
[2:03:24] prophet he's but a stump on the side of
[2:03:26] the road that God is using to bringing
[2:03:29] his people to
[2:03:31] himself that's come on Saints am I the
[2:03:35] only one rejoicing come on oh it's the
[2:03:37] anointing no the anointing is everywhere
[2:03:40] amen wherever you may be in the back and
[2:03:42] the front God fills all time all space
[2:03:45] he fills everything and he fills every
[2:03:48] heart who has the desire
[2:03:53] amen amen amen amen so he says to be
[2:03:56] partakers it's in the word here he says
[2:03:59] glory be to God and it's just a word for
[2:04:02] some but to us it's a
[2:04:08] manifestation they say I see no more
[2:04:10] word but for us it's a
[2:04:14] reality isn't that
[2:04:16] something that's why we have boldness to
[2:04:19] enter into the holiest of Hol
[2:04:23] am and not to go in is
[2:04:26] death you must enter in
[2:04:31] Christ few more
[2:04:34] moments he
[2:04:37] says that blood
[2:04:39] cell perfect lamb that God created God
[2:04:43] came in that blood cell was pierced what
[2:04:47] for to open that cell where no man had
[2:04:50] ever entered before before think of
[2:04:55] it no man ever entered before even
[2:05:01] Spurgeon he said when they came to
[2:05:04] him well what is Malachi
[2:05:07] 4 Revelation
[2:05:09] 10:7 he says do not
[2:05:14] touch because that's for somebody who
[2:05:18] will come on the
[2:05:20] sea when
[2:05:22] in our time in our time in our age so he
[2:05:26] was wise enough not to say hey I'm going
[2:05:28] to
[2:05:32] explain he knew so that blood cell that
[2:05:36] no man have ever entered to bring you
[2:05:39] and I in that blood
[2:05:44] cell isn't that something and then he
[2:05:47] says we are joined HS with Christ in the
[2:05:51] kingdom of God God woo he says the god
[2:05:54] in you wake
[2:05:59] up are you being wak
[2:06:01] up by the word of God not by Brother
[2:06:05] David that is just you know jumping
[2:06:07] around oh this joy that I have you can

[2:06:30] started streaming it's really by God's
[2:06:32] predestination because she was looking

[2:06:45] I've been reading the Bible and and and
[2:06:48] and and what they say in the Catholic
[2:06:50] church is wrong and then and what you
[2:06:52] say is true it's not what I say it's
[2:06:54] what he
[2:06:55] says amen I baptized that sister during
[2:06:59] covid she's about eight hours away from

[2:14:22] and that's why we should run the race
[2:14:25] that is before us lay aside everything
[2:14:28] that is
[2:14:31] against but
[2:14:34] deity
[2:14:36] lays in the brother or sister that
[2:14:38] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:40] when he was on the cross amen It Was
[2:14:43] Written of me in my father's word I have
[2:14:45] confirmed it Yonder at the cross it is
[2:14:49] finished
[2:14:51] right how many can say that with me it
[2:14:54] is
[2:14:56] finished he paid the price for my
[2:14:59] salvation he paid the price for my
[2:15:02] Redemption he paid the price for my
[2:15:05] healing he paid it
[2:15:09] all Hallelujah listen the Earth knew it
[2:15:13] was him it shook with great earthquake
[2:15:17] when he died we all know what happened
[2:15:21] the moon and the sun hid their
[2:15:24] face can go in and I'll leave
[2:15:27] that God put way from the
[2:15:31] beginning those two
[2:15:33] lights one the Sun for the day the moon
[2:15:37] a reflection that's a type of Christ and
[2:15:40] the
[2:15:41] bride to reflect you see the words he
[2:15:44] uses
[2:15:46] reflector the bride to reflect his glory
[2:15:51] and then when the ultimate price was
[2:15:54] paid for
[2:15:56] us the moon and the sun hid their
[2:16:01] face do you know
[2:16:03] why because there was the light the True
[2:16:09] Light there was the True Light that each
[2:16:13] and everyone
[2:16:15] needed Jesus Christ amen and as we
[2:16:20] approach Christmas I'm going to give you
[2:16:21] a Christmas sermon but let his light
[2:16:25] Jesus Christ shine through your life you
[2:16:30] young Sisters You elderly sisters you
[2:16:32] young Brothers you elderly Brothers amen
[2:16:35] may we be a reflector amen of God's
[2:16:38] glory in this dark and gloomy age
[2:16:42] because that's what is going on D now in
[2:16:47] the
[2:16:48] bride Hallelujah
[2:16:51] amen amen amen he oh and when God when
[2:16:54] when when he went
[2:16:57] down Satan thought he had a
[2:17:00] victory but he took him by the
[2:17:03] neck
[2:17:05] that's you thought you had
[2:17:08] me are you listening I know Satan is
[2:17:11] running after us trying seeking who he
[2:17:14] may
[2:17:16] devour create that world where the
[2:17:19] pillar of Fire
[2:17:21] there you know
[2:17:24] why CU he's afraid of
[2:17:27] fire Daniel created the
[2:17:30] atmosphere those I've been to Africa for
[2:17:34] those that went to Africa when a lion
[2:17:38] roars it is scary there's something
[2:17:43] woo but when
[2:17:46] those lions that hadn't been fed for
[2:17:49] days and Daniel he didn't listen to what
[2:17:53] the king or whoever could
[2:17:56] say I will keep
[2:18:00] worshiping I will keep praising God in
[2:18:04] the good and in the bad times I will
[2:18:06] give him glory no matter what well
[2:18:09] Daniel I'm sorry I love you very much
[2:18:11] but I put a law and I have to throw you
[2:18:13] in the D in the end the Lions
[2:18:16] then you know Satan comes and makes you
[2:18:19] all kinds of promises he has nothing to
[2:18:21] give you you're not hearing me he has
[2:18:24] nothing to give you young people he has
[2:18:27] nothing to give
[2:18:29] you but God gives him gives us
[2:18:33] everything amen So Daniel was thrown in
[2:18:36] he creates the
[2:18:37] atmosphere amen where the fire comes
[2:18:41] down those Lions what do they become
[2:18:45] little
[2:18:46] kittens hey you love the prophet read
[2:18:49] the word
[2:18:52] they are afraid of fire even those lions
[2:18:56] and I love how the prophet says amen and
[2:18:58] we can't we can make a little drama out
[2:19:00] of it come on here
[2:19:02] lion I need a little pillow here the
[2:19:05] other one lay here I need nice warm
[2:19:08] think of
[2:19:09] it I don't know I don't know what you're
[2:19:12] facing but he
[2:19:14] knows and when you create that
[2:19:19] atmosphere when the
[2:19:21] light is shining through you no demon of
[2:19:25] hell can get
[2:19:28] you isn't that
[2:19:30] wonderful Why Don't We Stand trying to
[2:19:32] find something
[2:19:36] to you know that's what makes Satan's
[2:19:40] mad that's what shakes
[2:19:43] him when the Church of Jesus Christ only
[2:19:47] knew who they were
[2:19:50] because he said there's nothing
[2:19:55] impossible to
[2:19:58] you
[2:19:59] Saints Prophet Cole also talks about how
[2:20:03] we should pinch our conscience it's
[2:20:05] about time we pinch
[2:20:08] ourselves we are walking brothers
[2:20:11] sisters in the
[2:20:14] spoken word Vision
[2:20:18] that's there will be a bride without to
[2:20:21] W
[2:20:24] up and the prophet says she is
[2:20:30] him that's why he says deity
[2:20:35] lays and those that receive the baptism
[2:20:38] of holy ghost that doesn't make us two
[2:20:41] anymore are you hearing me there are no
[2:20:44] more Twain They are
[2:20:47] one and here we have people that makes a
[2:20:49] trinity again
[2:20:53] God's W from before the foundation of
[2:20:56] the world God's plan was to have a
[2:21:01] bride without spot or wrinkle and for
[2:21:04] this final age to reveal himself in
[2:21:10] us so maybe you're not and thank God
[2:21:14] you're not Mr
[2:21:16] Trump but people you know they look up
[2:21:19] to some certain people
[2:21:22] yeah you are you value way more than all
[2:21:28] whatever the world can call great
[2:21:32] right because he chose
[2:21:35] us Saints day after day we are walking
[2:21:39] in the spoken word
[2:21:42] Vision that is manifesting
[2:21:44] itself so let us rejoice and be glad
[2:21:49] amen because we serve a mighty God and I
[2:21:52] don't know if this may be the last time
[2:21:54] I don't
[2:21:56] know because let me tell you one thing
[2:21:59] when when we look in the scriptures
[2:22:02] there ain't much time
[2:22:05] left are you hearing me there ain't much
[2:22:10] time
[2:22:12] left Israel is is in her
