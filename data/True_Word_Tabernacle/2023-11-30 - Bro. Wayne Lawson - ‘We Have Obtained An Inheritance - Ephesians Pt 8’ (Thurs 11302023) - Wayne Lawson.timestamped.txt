[2:04] tonight isn't it amen there's just
[2:06] nothing like the presence amen the
[2:08] prophet of God said that he revealed his

[2:16] desire of the church is released in his
[2:18] presence amen amen it's certainly good

[2:23] to see everyone out this evening and
[2:25] amen we we thank the Lord for his
[2:27] Blessing amen upon the word and uh the
[2:30] service Sunday what a what a tremendous
[2:32] time to be in the presence of the Lord
[2:35] amen when he just sweeps through the
[2:36] church and sovereignly begins to deal
[2:38] with hearts and
[2:41] amen you know I don't think we commend
[2:45] uh the church here enough maybe I don't
[2:47] have the ability or the words maybe
[2:50] sometimes to express it and the more I
[2:52] talk the more nervous I get but uh if I
[2:54] don't start preaching I'll get all
[2:56] nervous usually but uh I I know where
[2:58] I'm at and the anointing but if I talk
[3:00] I'm don't tell them what I'll say you
[3:03] but U but we certainly love you all and
[3:06] and uh and what a what a tremendous
[3:08] group of people and I I so I want to
[3:11] commend you on your abilities just to
[3:13] lay aside everything and get in the
[3:15] presence of the Lord and I know a lot of
[3:17] you go through things and you've got
[3:19] situations and and you're working all
[3:21] day and you're coming and businesses and
[3:24] work problems and home situations and
[3:26] sicknesses and but the spirit of the
[3:28] Lord is never hindered you just always
[3:31] come and set aside whatever is happening
[3:34] and get right in the presence of the
[3:35] Lord and it's very commendable to to see
[3:37] a group of people that understand the
[3:39] need of the Holy Spirit to move with
[3:41] liberty and freedom Amen in the church

[4:45] would bless them tonight and you would
[4:47] take your word and Lord truly we could
[4:50] open the pages of the Bible but Lord
[4:53] there's no way we could open the
[4:54] Revelation so we ask you would come in
[4:57] the building tonight Lord and that
[5:00] may you just pick it up Lord may you put
[5:03] the scripture together in the hearts
[5:04] Lord and may an understanding come of
[5:07] reality and truth and we ask you for it
[5:10] tonight father as we commit this meeting
[5:12] into thy faithful hands in the name of
[5:15] the Lord Jesus we pray amen and amen and
[5:20] if you have your Bibles tonight we just
[5:22] like to go into the book of
[5:23] Ephesians uh I want to go into Ephesians
[5:25] chapter 1 and verse 11 uh I'm going to
[5:30] be reading uh 111 down to verse
[5:34] 14 and
[5:36] um this next uh next half of this
[5:40] chapter is just just amazing this is an
[5:42] amazing book the book of Ephesians of
[5:45] course it's the end time Book of Joshua
[5:47] right so uh you're definitely going to
[5:50] find yourself in this book Amen in
[5:53] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11 in whom
[5:56] also we have obtained an inheritance
[6:00] being predestinated according to the
[6:02] purpose of him who worketh all things
[6:04] after the counsel of his own will that
[6:09] we should be to the praise of the glory
[6:11] who first trusted in Christ in whom ye
[6:16] also trusted after that you heard the
[6:19] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[6:21] salvation in whom also after that you
[6:24] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[6:26] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[6:30] of our inheritance until the Redemption
[6:34] of the purchased possession and un the
[6:36] praise of his glory amen you may be
[6:40] seated tonight I'm going to be
[6:42] continuing on this Ephesian series but
[6:44] I'm going to speak a little bit tonight
[6:45] on having obtained an
[6:48] inheritance um I want to read this
[6:51] portion uh out of the Amplified it's
[6:53] just it's just so good in in the 11th
[6:56] verse in him we also were made God's
[6:58] heritage portion we obtained an
[7:02] inheritance for we had been
[7:05] foreordained chosen and appointed
[7:08] beforehand in accordance with his
[7:11] purpose who works out everything in
[7:14] agreement with a counsel and design of
[7:17] his own will I think that's pretty
[7:19] powerful isn't it he works it all out
[7:21] with a counsel and design of his own
[7:23] will so that we who first hoped in
[7:26] Christ who we put our confidence in in
[7:29] him as having been destined and
[7:31] appointed to live for the praise of his
[7:34] glory amen to live for the praise of his
[7:37] glory I like the 14th verse for the
[7:39] spirit is the guarantee of our
[7:42] inheritance it is the first fruits of
[7:44] the Pledge and the foretaste it's the
[7:46] down payment of our heritage in
[7:50] anticipation of its full Redemption and
[7:53] our requiring of a complete possession
[7:55] to the praise of his glory amen this is
[7:59] a this is from the Amplified the
[8:00] original version of the Amplified I
[8:02] actually have one of those older
[8:04] Amplified Bibles they're pretty neat uh
[8:06] it's sometimes and then if you have the
[8:09] uh Interlinear uh the old Greek dial
[8:12] diaglog that brother bam used it's also
[8:14] it's a very good read in the book of
[8:16] Ephesians it has a it has some very good
[8:19] things setting there and showing the
[8:21] appropriation of a certain of a certain
[8:24] portion uh unto a people and then that
[8:27] would be by a predestination or God
[8:30] God's own choosing or his own will amen
[8:33] I I I would like to just take and think
[8:35] about this tonight that we have obtained
[8:37] an inheritance and U and of course
[8:40] speaking here of the bride's portion
[8:43] amen I believe uh that we're looking at
[8:45] a time of course that this is not a
[8:48] natural land but it is a spiritual land
[8:52] and so we're going to rehearse a couple
[8:53] things through here you're going to hear
[8:55] some things you've heard uh but in the
[8:57] book of Ephesians you're Crossing so
[8:59] many many different points that have
[9:00] been made previously uh throughout the
[9:02] message of the hour but the prophet says
[9:05] it like this it's not a natural land it
[9:07] is a spiritual land amen so we realize
[9:10] that the promises that have been given
[9:12] to us is in a spiritual realm the the
[9:15] spiritual promises so we recognize that
[9:17] God can give us something but we're
[9:19] going to have to fight for it amen uh
[9:22] I'll just have to say sometimes we
[9:24] realize this we're going to have to
[9:25] press into these promises they're not
[9:27] always going to come easy it's not
[9:30] always just going to be a cakewalk as we
[9:32] would call it or a flyy bed of ease but
[9:35] we do want to assure you that you are an
[9:39] overcomer amen I don't know if you've
[9:41] thought about it lately but I just want
[9:42] you to know you are the champion you are
[9:46] actually the Overcomer you're the winner
[9:48] in this book when you I I like sometimes
[9:51] if I read a novel I don't read many of
[9:53] them but I like to read the back of the
[9:54] book first and figure out what what kind
[9:56] of book I'm reading and I I I like the
[9:59] The Book of Revelations is one of my
[10:00] favorite books of this scripture and it
[10:02] tells us where everything ends up and
[10:04] I'll tell you this if you read the back
[10:06] of the book you're the winner in this
[10:08] book you have that Revelation that's
[10:10] been setting there before you now of
[10:12] course in in this bride amen she is the
[10:15] Overcomer and been for ordained in the
[10:18] body of Christ she has been spoke about
[10:21] all the way throughout the Old Testament
[10:23] this is something that has been a
[10:25] mystery hid not uncomprehended but it
[10:28] needs to be initiated before you can see
[10:31] the scripture and what it was meaning
[10:33] cuz this this bride has been in him the
[10:36] entire time she was of course the tree
[10:39] that that would David would sing about
[10:41] and say that she's like a tree planted
[10:43] by the water and amen though amen though
[10:46] the tree would be cut down the roots
[10:48] wouldn't be uh uh withered and and she
[10:50] would come again in all of her glory and
[10:52] see he was talking about the church he
[10:54] was talking about something that was
[10:56] going to be coming forth amen the bride
[10:58] of Christ Christ this is what he's
[11:00] talking about in The Book of Revelations
[11:02] in the 21st chapter a city set on a hill
[11:05] coming down out of Heaven and her Jasper
[11:08] walls and her streets of gold and the
[11:10] light is the Lamb itself he's speaking
[11:13] of the Bride see all throughout the
[11:15] scripture that great mystery of the
[11:16] Bride is laying there but it's not until
[11:18] the message of the hour comes and it
[11:20] begins to to lace out where we were and
[11:24] what part spoke to us and I I often uh
[11:27] think about the Book of Joshua it's
[11:28] pretty amazing to me at the Book of
[11:30] Joshua and how that uh in in the Bible
[11:33] when God gives them early on even
[11:35] Bethlehem itself is not really even
[11:37] spoke of until like in the book of
[11:40] numbers and then it just gives a little
[11:41] small scripture there but when Joshua is
[11:43] kneading out all of the land it's not
[11:46] even discussed but it just talks about
[11:48] the land of Judah don't even but but
[11:50] brother Bram said but in the mind of
[11:52] that of God that was laying there in
[11:54] there and waiting for a time to come out
[11:56] and and there Bethlehem would be the
[11:58] place of the Messiah and his birth but
[12:00] it was hid until a certain season until
[12:03] a certain time and then after it was it
[12:05] was manifest then we seen it and and so
[12:08] we recognize that that that the things
[12:10] that we see and the things that we have
[12:13] have belonged to us for a long time
[12:15] things that that that have went
[12:17] unclaimed things that God has given us
[12:19] his promises but yet they they've been
[12:21] ours the whole time amen but just now
[12:24] really recognizing what has belonged to
[12:27] us and what we really should Poss and
[12:29] how we should go into it and I I say
[12:31] this I I I I want to know and and with
[12:34] reality that everything that we are
[12:36] taking as Believers have already been
[12:38] paid for and I I I believe I believe
[12:41] that we have to pay for what we're
[12:43] talking about I I don't believe any of
[12:45] this is free I don't believe amen that
[12:48] that we're just going to skate into it I
[12:50] believe it has to be paid for and I'll
[12:52] say this supreme promises have been made
[12:55] but Supreme sacrifice has been made for
[12:58] them
[12:59] it was a supreme Son of God by a supreme
[13:01] sacrifice that gave us Supreme promises
[13:04] and them have been made for us and I can
[13:06] stand here tonight and plainly declare
[13:09] to this bride City every promise that
[13:12] God has made to this church has already
[13:15] been paid for matter of fact we have the
[13:18] receipt that Jesus said and brother
[13:21] brother man brings us up in my
[13:22] commission he says when he died at
[13:24] Calvary he paid the Supreme price and
[13:28] every Redemptive blessing that he died
[13:30] for at Calvary is already paid before
[13:34] God and the debt is fully paid my
[13:37] goodness amen you are excused before God
[13:40] you've been taken out of the pawn shop
[13:43] and the only thing you have to do is
[13:45] accept and Faith Christ and walk out of
[13:47] that pawn shop and that's all amen I'll
[13:50] tell you this amen it's already been
[13:52] paid for and here's the thing today I
[13:54] know that there are other voices and I
[13:57] know that there are things that you must
[13:59] war in this spiritual world but I will
[14:02] tell you this any spirit that says it's
[14:05] not paid for never come from God any
[14:08] spirit that says to you you cannot
[14:10] possess these things did not come from
[14:12] God Amen but I believe we could rehearse
[14:15] what they said in the Old Testament when
[14:17] Caleb and Joshua were looking at the
[14:19] land and and others were looking at the
[14:21] obstacles and Joshua and Caleb said look
[14:24] amen we are more than able to take this
[14:27] land and I believe we could Echo that
[14:29] same thing here tonight that we are more
[14:31] than able to take this land and somebody
[14:34] said brother Wayne how do you say that
[14:35] in the face of all the issues and all
[14:38] the different oppositions and challenges
[14:40] that we have today well there's this
[14:42] difference between Caleb and Joshua and
[14:44] everybody else amen everybody was
[14:46] looking at the opposition and the
[14:48] challenges but Caleb and Joshua was
[14:50] looking square at the promises of God
[14:53] and they knew the god that made them
[14:55] they knew there was a promise laying
[14:56] there and as long as they kept their eye
[14:59] on the promise that would not be any
[15:01] failure Amen in the Church of the Living
[15:03] God and I'll say this tonight if we'll
[15:05] keep our eye on the promise of God all
[15:07] things are possible to you that believe
[15:10] God has given this church in possession
[15:12] of everything amen all we have to do is
[15:15] possess it and accept it because it's
[15:17] already been paid for when I think of
[15:20] this today the prophet of God said see
[15:22] amen anything anything that's contrary
[15:24] to the word of God Is A
[15:26] Lie anything cont to with the word of
[15:29] God was a lie brother abam said Abraham
[15:32] wasn't afraid to put it to work he said
[15:34] are you the same Faith he gave Abraham
[15:37] he gives it to you freely if you'll use
[15:39] it say I have a gun I like this he says
[15:42] say I have a I got a couple of them guns
[15:44] you know brother said you you just got
[15:46] you a gun brother R said it like this he
[15:48] said say I have a gun he said it'll

[15:59] it see it hangs on the wall that's your

[16:09] something with it get out and Hunt up

[16:14] hurting and you say you're a liar he

[16:19] scope and don't be afraid to pull the
[16:21] trigger cuz it'll go off as sure as
[16:23] anything yes sir he says it'll go off
[16:26] Abraham like God called things which
[16:28] were were not as though they were
[16:30] anything contrary to God's promise was a
[16:33] lie to Abraham anything contrary was a
[16:38] lie I love that ain't you hunt that
[16:41] devil up tonight and call him a liar
[16:43] amen instead of going deer hunting we
[16:44] can go devil hunting tonight hunt that
[16:46] devil up amen and say devil you're a
[16:48] liar and I got a gun here tonight and
[16:51] it's not just a 22 or a little
[16:53] peashooter amen this is an Adam Bomb of
[16:56] thus saith the Lord amen to drop on that
[16:59] devil tonight amen I tell you this the
[17:01] prophet of God said the holy spirit
[17:03] makes you call anything contrary to
[17:06] God's word as though it were not amen I
[17:09] know many times we don't like to tell
[17:10] people they're a liar but the devil is a
[17:12] liar and you got every right to tell him
[17:14] he is tonight amen amen the prophet of
[17:17] God says it like this when you leave
[17:19] everything behind you every care every
[17:22] worry everything that says you can't be
[17:24] a Christian i've smoked too long I've
[17:26] drank too long brother random I've lived
[17:28] in adultery I don't care what you say
[17:31] and what you've done though your sins be
[17:33] a Scarlet you once pass that line of
[17:36] barrier the devil trying to torment you
[17:38] saying you can't do it you can't do it I
[17:41] said I can do it for Jesus said
[17:43] whosoever will let him come drink of the
[17:45] Waters of free amen leave it behind you
[17:48] amen yes you can absolutely we are more
[17:52] than able to take the land and the
[17:54] possessions of it amen I don't know amen
[17:57] I don't have to make you a chance ion
[17:58] you already are a champion I don't have
[18:01] to make you a winner you already are I
[18:03] don't have to amen pep you up and talk
[18:05] you into winning this God has already
[18:07] anointed you and already put you in the
[18:10] back of this Bible as the winner of this
[18:12] race and I say this tonight we ought to
[18:14] just lift up our eyes and press on to
[18:17] the mark of the High Calling that's in
[18:19] Christ Jesus forgetting things that are
[18:22] behind us to move on amen amen amen the
[18:25] prophet of God said the Holy Spirit
[18:27] would never make you do anything
[18:29] contrary to the scripture the the spirit
[18:32] would never make you God's spirit would
[18:35] never make you amen deny one of these
[18:37] promises amen it would never be the
[18:40] spirit of God in Romans 3 and: three it
[18:42] said what if some did not believe shall
[18:44] their unbelief make the fa Faith Of God
[18:47] without effect God forbid yay let God be
[18:50] true and every man a liar as it is
[18:55] written thou mightest be justified in
[18:57] thy s and thou might have overcome when
[19:00] thou art judged Amen in Romans 4:17 for
[19:04] I have made thee the father of many
[19:05] nations and before him he believed even
[19:08] God that quickeneth the dead and calleth
[19:10] things which were not as though they
[19:13] were now that wasn't actually Abraham
[19:15] that was actually God that did that and
[19:18] brother randam attributes it to Abraham
[19:20] right right one time I thought well
[19:22] maybe brother BR didn't realize that the
[19:24] scripture was saying that God did that
[19:26] but then I got to reading one day and he
[19:28] most certainly did amen but what
[19:30] happened is Abraham so much was like God
[19:34] and he repeated it the way God repeated
[19:36] it he confessed it the way God confessed
[19:38] it and I believe tonight that we can
[19:40] speak it just like God speaks it amen I
[19:43] believe we can I believe we can tell the
[19:45] devil tonight amen you are of the Father
[19:48] the devil and his lust of your fathers
[19:50] will he do he was a murderer from the
[19:52] beginning and Abode not in the truth
[19:54] because there was no truth in him and
[19:56] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh his
[19:58] own for he is a liar and the father of
[20:02] it amen you Sur preacher what are you
[20:05] doing the prophets is trying to show us
[20:07] something our approach to our
[20:09] inheritance now amen what what are we
[20:11] looking at brother R said he was he was
[20:13] at that uh stomach problem for years you
[20:15] remember it and he said he went and got
[20:17] prayer and he said they told him if you
[20:18] eat solid food you're going to die he
[20:20] said I went home after prayer and told
[20:23] Mom to put me up a bowl of beans and a
[20:25] big onion I tell you what he knew how to
[20:27] eat didn't he hey amen get me a bowl of
[20:29] beans and onion amen I a big chunk of
[20:31] cornbread I tell you what that's that's
[20:33] home right there amen amen so we we I'm
[20:37] getting hungry amen but but the prophet
[20:39] said he ate that and he said as he was
[20:42] eating it he said the devil was telling
[20:43] him he was going to die he said the the
[20:45] bean started coming up and he was
[20:47] pressing them back down amen you
[20:49] remember that he said they just started
[20:51] burping up he said I started putting
[20:52] them back down singing I can I will I do
[20:56] believe I can I will I do believe now
[21:00] that's see that's simple but it'll stick
[21:02] to the ribs folks amen that that that
[21:05] was uh what he explained how he was
[21:08] overcoming the greatest uh problem in
[21:10] his life brother BR always had that
[21:12] stomach problem it was always there amen
[21:15] and and it wasn't like brother Greg he
[21:17] had to overcome it that one time brother
[21:19] random had to overcome that his whole
[21:22] life amen he had to push it back his
[21:24] whole life amen but he said God's word
[21:27] said it I healed amen and I stood that I
[21:30] won't get into it brother Ronnie amen
[21:32] but but God's word said I'm healed amen
[21:34] and so he stood right there on it and
[21:36] and he walked out and somebody said how
[21:38] you feeling brother Bill and he said
[21:40] well I'm feeling just fine they said
[21:42] well ain't you lying he said no sir I'm
[21:44] not lying I'm confessing the word of God
[21:47] Amen I'll tell you what confess means to
[21:49] me the same thing as sometimes you have
[21:52] to pick up the promise of God and beat
[21:55] the devil back with it so you can conf
[21:58] Fess you're healing and if it wasn't for
[22:00] the word of God you couldn't do it
[22:02] because you don't feel healed you don't
[22:04] think you're healed amen you you're not
[22:06] feeling well at all but the word of God
[22:09] gives you the opportunity to stand in a
[22:12] place of healing when you don't feel
[22:14] like you're healed amen but you can deny
[22:17] every sense and confess the word of God
[22:20] and hold the promises of God over that
[22:23] brother B said upon such a word I wonder
[22:25] tonight if our listeners how can we be
[22:27] so petty and so dilatory about reaching
[22:30] out and taking a hold of the promises of
[22:32] God when he gave his blessed promise to
[22:35] his church I'll be with you even in you
[22:37] to the end of the age and then we set
[22:39] along as if God never said it but
[22:42] whatever you bind in the earth I bind it
[22:44] in heaven whatever you loose in the
[22:47] earth I'll loose it in heaven whether
[22:49] it's sickness whether it's disease whe
[22:51] ever it is God blessed promised it's our
[22:55] privilege to pick up this promise and
[22:58] use it I say glory to God I got a
[23:00] privilege tonight to pick up this Bible
[23:02] and use it in the face of opposition I
[23:05] can tell you you're a champion already
[23:08] Amen in the face of the greatest
[23:09] problems of your life I can say just
[23:11] hold on just a little while because
[23:14] you're the Overcomer brother I know how
[23:17] it's going to End Amen the Church of the
[23:19] Living God is going to come out in
[23:22] Victory amen you ain't going to lose
[23:24] this battle amen I'll tell you one thing
[23:26] amen if we can just get through it's
[23:28] going to be
[23:30] okay the preacher you seem awful awful
[23:32] determined in that point well I'll tell
[23:34] you the reason being cuz my Bible said
[23:36] amen that all things work together for
[23:39] the good of them that love God and are
[23:42] called according to his purpose and I'll
[23:44] tell you this tonight the devil don't
[23:46] have enough Devils hell don't have
[23:48] enough Angels Amen to defeat the Church
[23:50] of the Living God we have been anointed
[23:53] for the challenge of this age God has
[23:55] sent forth the spirit of his son upon
[23:58] the church to manifest his promises in
[24:01] this age and it's our privilege tonight
[24:03] to pick this promise up and use it and
[24:05] you imagine tonight we got a right to
[24:07] use it I I like that personally because
[24:11] you know in uh as a minister you all you
[24:14] all know sometimes uh maybe some of you
[24:17] mothers understand that you get you get
[24:19] in a situation where your baby sick or
[24:21] something like that and you really don't
[24:23] know how to handle it but you got a
[24:24] privilege to pick up the
[24:26] promise you got a privilege to pick that
[24:29] promise up and use it now here's the
[24:31] thing according to the prophet we got a
[24:33] we got a privilege to do it now when you
[24:35] start looking at this inheritance of
[24:38] course the church has been giving this
[24:40] in this age now when we go back and we
[24:42] look in the Book of Revelations the 10th
[24:44] chapter what we see in Revelations 10 is
[24:48] we see an open book in the hand of the
[24:50] angel coming down from heaven that book
[24:53] you're seeing in Revelations 10 open is
[24:57] the book that was was closed in
[24:58] Revelations 5 in Revelations 5 John was
[25:02] instructed that nobody could even touch
[25:04] or look at that book but in Revelations
[25:07] the 10th chapter John was being
[25:09] commanded to come and take the book and
[25:12] not only look but to eat the book so
[25:15] through Revelations 5 to Revelations 10
[25:17] something had taken place that had
[25:20] opened access to the promise that they
[25:22] could receive this now watch in
[25:24] Revelation 6 and verse one the Bible
[25:26] says and the land stood there and opened
[25:29] the book with the first seal being and
[25:31] brother B said there he stands tonight
[25:32] with the book open now the possession of
[25:35] that book now this is a very powerful
[25:37] area and you you might want to put this
[25:39] one on your refrigerator in the breach
[25:41] brother RMA say this it's the Redemption
[25:44] means all legal possession to all that
[25:48] was lost by Adam and Eve what it ought
[25:51] to do to a born again Christian it's
[25:53] legal possession of that book its legal
[25:56] possession to the abstract deed to the
[25:58] title deed of eternal life means that
[26:01] you possess everything that Adam and Eve
[26:05] lost what of it Brethren amen they had
[26:08] possession of that deed amen it means we
[26:12] have everything that Adam lost now it
[26:15] would be it would be maybe our thought
[26:16] to think well it's always been that way
[26:18] but it hasn't always been that way in
[26:21] Revelations 5 they couldn't touch it
[26:23] Revelations 10 he's invited to take it
[26:25] what is the separating point the lamb
[26:28] took the book and descended to the
[26:30] seventh angel on the earth Amen in in
[26:33] the Book of Revelations the seventh
[26:35] angel was that key piece amen between
[26:38] not getting the book and being able to
[26:40] eat the book that's just very simple but
[26:43] God sets times and God is the one that
[26:47] sets
[26:48] Seasons I'll say this from the
[26:50] believer's position 1955 brother bam
[26:52] says God's word belongs in our life and
[26:55] God sets times and time limits
[26:58] and it all works to that time youall
[27:02] believe God sets the times sure amen and
[27:05] you you if you was with us on Sunday
[27:07] we're preaching on the mystery of his
[27:08] will right and we were looking at that
[27:11] the word brings the will of God now
[27:13] listen to this part of this quote he
[27:15] said you have to find the will of God
[27:18] and the time of God to do it you got to
[27:22] find the will of God and the time of God
[27:25] to do it that was what was wrong with
[27:27] Moses
[27:28] amen Moses amen understood that he was a
[27:31] deliverer but he got the wrong timing
[27:34] and he wasn't able to do it now he knew
[27:37] it was the will of God but he was out of
[27:39] time with it and he didn't know that God
[27:41] was in it at that moment he kills one
[27:43] man banished to the back side of the
[27:45] desert for 40 years amen so but what he
[27:48] done is of course he loses amen the side
[27:51] of Freedom he loses this and brother B
[27:54] said he had lost the idea of freedom he
[27:56] said but God met him one day in a
[27:58] burning bush and when God's season came
[28:01] along just exactly he revealed his plan
[28:04] to Moses I love this and the reason
[28:07] Moses had forgot about the freedom
[28:09] because God promised he would have it
[28:12] but God hadn't forgot the promise and
[28:15] Moses tried in himself and failed that's
[28:17] what the church has done many times
[28:19] tried in ourselves and we fail in God's
[28:23] element of time he says it like this
[28:26] amen we find out God God works
[28:28] everything seasonally and Moses when he
[28:31] had failed to find the time limit of God
[28:34] you see if you get ahead of God you get
[28:36] behind God but you want to be right in
[28:38] the season of God God has a season for
[28:41] your life he has a season for this
[28:43] church he has a season for his word now
[28:46] we're experiencing one of the greatest
[28:48] Seasons we've ever had as a church amen
[28:50] amen I know we've been here 10 years
[28:52] myself and and and we're and we're
[28:55] looking at a great season amen of a
[28:57] liberty and a and a Grace and a mercy
[29:00] that is falling on the church and
[29:02] brother Ray and I look at each other
[29:03] once in a while and we say man just hold
[29:05] steady amen cuz I I I know the devil
[29:08] don't like the way things are so he's
[29:10] going to be doing everything he can but
[29:12] but you better you better remember this
[29:15] enjoy the seasons that are here don't be
[29:18] sitting there thinking about what it
[29:20] used to be some some other time in the
[29:23] past of our of our history as a church
[29:25] or or you're looking out in the future
[29:27] thinking when we get our new church and
[29:29] when all this goes we're going to have
[29:30] all great times and all that don't miss
[29:32] the season that you're in don't miss the
[29:35] greatest moments in the in the history
[29:37] of your life the the season that God is
[29:40] manifesting in this hour do you see what
[29:43] it was when Moses got into the front of
[29:45] that Burning Bush brother man said it

[29:49] the timing of God and when you see the
[29:51] whe and the timing of God brother I'll
[29:54] tell you what it's ready it's ready for

[30:07] appointed time and season today listen

[30:12] for this season Daniel said it would be
[30:15] in the time of the end Revelations 10

[30:20] brothers sisters amen tell somebody we
[30:23] have arrived we are at the end amen amen

[30:29] Revival of God this is the season to
[30:33] enjoy the revivals of God this is not

[30:52] well and Joshua Joshua ain't here
[30:54] tonight may I say this David did his job
[30:56] good and Paul did his job good and irius
[31:00] did his job good brother brandom did his
[31:02] job good but this is your season this is
[31:05] your hour The Paton has been placed in
[31:09] your hand I say the hour has come for
[31:12] the Church of the Living God to manifest
[31:15] these
[31:19] realities now you got to realize the
[31:22] specific day we're living was spoke of
[31:24] in scripture yes sir that's right in
[31:27] Revelations 10 and Daniel 12 Matthew 24
[31:31] Luke 17:30 John 14:20 at that
[31:36] day what day is that when the Revelation
[31:39] made
[31:40] known at that day that's that's this
[31:44] day isn't it
[31:46] beautiful the day when the son of man is
[31:49] revealed is the same day that day ye
[31:52] shall know Amen Let just somebody put a
[31:55] buzzer sign out and say God wants you to
[31:59] know what has been hid from other ages
[32:02] God wants you to know Amen in Genesis 21
[32:05] God told Sarah that there would be a
[32:09] time that the Lord had set an appointed
[32:12] time in Psalms 102 David talks about God
[32:16] setting an appointed time in
[32:20] Ecclesiastes chapter three to everything
[32:22] there is a season and there is a purpose
[32:25] under
[32:26] heaven timing is
[32:29] everything and to recognize the burning
[32:32] bush announc the timing and the will of
[32:35] God and to to rec to see this tonight
[32:39] that the message of the hour has told
[32:41] you your message and your season and
[32:44] your time and your hour and where you're
[32:46] sitting tonight that's right Amen to
[32:50] work into that
[32:52] season I could say with the
[32:54] prophets many men have lost
[32:57] longed to see this day and they did not
[33:01] and many eyes have longed to see this
[33:03] and have not and many ears have longed
[33:06] to hear this and have not but blessed
[33:09] are your
[33:10] eyes and blessed are your
[33:13] ears for your
[33:15] season has arrived praise the Lord when
[33:18] I look at this tonight in Revelation
[33:20] chapter 10 and verse 7 I know you're a
[33:22] Revelations 10 church amen in the
[33:25] seventh verse the Bible says when the
[33:27] trumpet call of the seventh angel is
[33:29] beginning to sound the mystery of God
[33:33] and I love how it says this in the
[33:34] Amplified that is the hidden purpose and
[33:38] plan is
[33:40] finished the mystery of God is finished
[33:44] see the spirit of the Lord opened that
[33:48] which had been hidden that's right that
[33:51] which had been mystery you are now been
[33:54] initiated but it was the spirit of the
[33:56] Lord that did it the same as it did it
[33:59] with Moses in the burning bush that same
[34:02] Pillar of Fire has announced this season
[34:05] and open the door for the church to move
[34:08] into the revelation of Christ in Luke
[34:11] chapter 4 it was Jesus that announced it
[34:14] in the 18th verse the spirit of the Lord
[34:17] is upon me what because Heath anointed
[34:21] me to preach the gospel to the poor see
[34:23] Jesus picked the scripture for the
[34:26] season he was living and said the spirit
[34:28] of the Lord is upon me to preach this
[34:31] acceptable year of the Lord amen amen
[34:35] and then he closed the book and said
[34:36] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[34:37] your ears now now just in uh just in uh
[34:41] how could I say this just in just a free
[34:43] spot for you that study the message I
[34:45] think it's a powerful season because
[34:48] Jesus changed something here if you're a
[34:50] studier of the Old Testament the laws of
[34:52] Jubilee they were always sounded by
[34:54] trumpet right uh they on the 50th year
[34:57] they'd take a trumpet and and the priest
[34:59] would go out and sound a Ram's Horn and
[35:01] he see they made the atonement at the at
[35:04] the temple they made the atonement at
[35:06] the camp but the priest would sound the
[35:09] trumpet in other areas announcing the
[35:12] atonement is made so you didn't see the
[35:15] atonement you actually heard it right
[35:18] amen the the sound was saying the
[35:21] atonement is here Jesus changed that
[35:24] from the sounding of a natural horn
[35:27] to the preaching of the
[35:29] gospel and he moved it saying the spirit
[35:31] of the Lord is upon me to declare to
[35:34] announce to Proclaim to Harold by the
[35:38] speaking of the voice the acceptable
[35:41] year of the Lord Has Come of course the
[35:44] Year of Jubilee struck in the 10th month
[35:47] and the seventh day the Year of Jubilee
[35:50] was a return to the will of God Amen if
[35:53] you watch Israel and when they went into
[35:55] their promised lands that land had been
[35:58] given to them and it was a perfect will
[36:00] of God for them to be in that land they
[36:03] spent 400 years in permissive wheel down
[36:05] there in Egypt but when the pillar of
[36:08] fire came it come to lead them to the
[36:11] perfect will of God for their lives and
[36:14] it was that fire that led them in their
[36:16] Promised Land it was a pillar of fire
[36:18] that returned and brought them into that
[36:20] land now here's the thing God knew that
[36:23] once they got in that land they were
[36:25] still humans and they would still be
[36:26] debts and there would still be problems
[36:28] you know the law of Jubilee and if they
[36:30] got in trouble they would sell out and
[36:32] maybe somebody would be go into slavery
[36:34] and something would happen or whatever
[36:35] but whenever they got out of that
[36:37] position when they got when when Gad got
[36:40] over somewhere in Judah or Judah got
[36:42] somewhere over somewhere amen when that
[36:44] happened amen that that would sound and
[36:47] when the sounding of that trumpet it
[36:49] would tell them it's time to return to
[36:51] the will of God The Inheritance that was
[36:54] given them was given to them by the will
[36:56] of God it was not theirs it was God that
[36:59] gave it to them do you see it was God
[37:02] Amen that had gave them their spiritual
[37:04] herriage amen and they were heir to
[37:07] everything that God said they could have
[37:10] I say this tonight that the Church of
[37:12] the Living God is heir to all things and
[37:15] it's been given to me I'm an heir see
[37:17] there's an inheritance and then there's
[37:19] an heir what the inheritance is is one
[37:22] thing but we're the heir of that
[37:24] inheritance and I can claim every
[37:26] everything that God promised to me there
[37:29] you are it's mine how do you get it
[37:32] something you done no sir it's an unmar
[37:35] gift that God gave us and it's ours and
[37:38] it belongs to us and Satan cannot hold
[37:41] it if you go to him in scriptural
[37:44] authoritative word my goodness H that's
[37:48] powerful ain't it if you go to the devil
[37:50] in scriptural authoritative word and lay
[37:54] it down say Satan it's mine lay it down
[37:58] my goodness when's the last time you
[38:00] really challenge Satan like that it
[38:02] belongs to me Satan lay it down amen now
[38:06] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11 for we
[38:09] obtain an inheritance obtaining an
[38:13] inheritance a an inheritance here in
[38:16] this specific scripture is the word
[38:18] claros k l e r o o it's it's a different
[38:23] word Greek word than most all the other
[38:26] words of inheritance in the New
[38:28] Testament this word actually deals with
[38:32] that it's talking about an assignment of
[38:34] an allotment it's it's talking about a
[38:37] possession that has been gained by the
[38:40] casting of Lots now if you're a study of
[38:43] the Old Testament you realize that the
[38:45] prophets would use Lots in the Old
[38:47] Testament amen and how that they would
[38:49] cast lots and the Lots would fall and
[38:51] then the inheritance according to the
[38:53] lot would fall on a certain tribe when
[38:56] God made the promise through Abraham
[38:58] through the Genesis 30 through their
[39:00] mothers Here Comes Joshua under
[39:02] inspiration and Joshua is going to place
[39:05] them in that land but the scripture
[39:07] tells us in Joshua 18 that Joshua said
[39:10] to the children of how long will you
[39:11] slack and go to possess this land which
[39:14] God has given unto us and he took out
[39:17] and they would cast lots and they would
[39:18] say this part belongs to you and this
[39:21] part belongs to you and this part
[39:23] belongs to you see it took out all the
[39:25] politics it took all of the man out of
[39:28] it amen and when those lots would fall
[39:30] upon them th that's what belonged to
[39:32] them it was their
[39:34] inheritance that God gave them and they
[39:37] could obtain it now here's the beauty of
[39:40] this to me that the prophet would speak
[39:42] about this and he would say that word
[39:45] inheritance he said oh God he says see
[39:48] here it is we have obtained an
[39:52] inheritance somebody has to leave you
[39:55] something before for the foundation of
[39:57] the world he left you something a name
[40:01] written on a book that when the lamb
[40:04] would be slain you would be recognized
[40:06] with it isn't that powerful he left you
[40:09] an inheritance you say way what is my
[40:11] inheritance your name is on the Lamb's
[40:15] Book of Life brother mam said in the
[40:17] church a book that there are names that
[40:19] is on the Lamb's Book of Life that
[40:21] cannot be removed nor can sin be added
[40:24] to those names and we must accept that I

[50:21] it's not about Doctrine it's about
[50:24] inheritance it's about sunship it's
[50:26] about adoption it's about who we were

[51:31] return back to every inheritance that
[51:34] God had gave them I say unto
[51:37] you Jesus said I say unto you may I say
[51:41] I say unto
[51:43] you if you shall say under this
[51:51] mountain this whole earth has been
[51:54] groaning for the manifestation of
[51:58] sons true Sons born Sons when they begin
[52:02] to
[52:03] speak the word becomes back I believe
[52:06] we're on the road of it tonight the
[52:07] prophet
[52:09] said hey he says it like this this is
[52:12] the day of the manifestation of sons see
[52:15] you got to find the season you got to
[52:18] find the timing you got to find the will
[52:20] of God so what does the will of God mean
[52:22] it's everything the will of God's
[52:24] everything CU everything works to his
[52:27] purpose and to his will try to stop the
[52:29] will of God you'll never do it try to
[52:32] keep it from happening you'll never do
[52:34] it because when the will of God sets an
[52:36] action it's going to fulfill exactly
[52:39] what God has
[52:42] prophesied this is the day of the
[52:44] manifestation this is the hour of the
[52:46] Fulfillment of the scripture you'll
[52:48] never stop it from
[52:50] happening it just ain't
[52:53] possible you'll never you'll never never
[52:55] stop it the prophet of God said there's
[52:57] going to come a true genuine and
[52:59] anointed Holy Ghost God called
[53:02] church that when they speak the word
[53:04] it'll flash like
[53:06] lightning brother brother
[53:10] brother in spiritual Amnesia brother Ram
[53:13] said we got to be identified with John
[53:15] 14:12 The Works that I do shall he do
[53:18] also don't forget
[53:20] it if you do you got spiritual
[53:24] amnesia yeah see they forgot they were
[53:29] Gods isn't that crazy they forgot they
[53:32] were
[53:33] gods they forgot their position with
[53:37] God say well it ain't possible King did
[53:39] it one time yeah a king did it a king
[53:43] went out and ate grass with a beast cuz
[53:45] he forgot he was a king yeah he had all
[53:49] authority as a king but he forgot he was
[53:51] a
[53:53] king he lost it as a
[53:55] beast but wasn't it seven
[53:59] years I think my my my memory is going
[54:03] preaching on memory and I'm losing my
[54:06] memory believe it's seven
[54:09] years and look what at least seven Frost
[54:12] or seven does but you see what happens
[54:15] is he comes back to the to the
[54:19] kingship see people
[54:21] forget they forget who they are they
[54:23] forget their Christian balance they
[54:25] forget what God really made
[54:27] them do you see what the prophet of God
[54:30] said he's telling us that deity will be
[54:32] restored at the end time that deity
[54:36] actually is not in
[54:38] heaven amen that deity is in
[54:42] you do you know the greatest power in
[54:44] the world is not the atomic
[54:48] bomb it's a believer in contact with his
[54:51] maker
[54:53] Hallelujah now
[54:56] if you know the will of
[54:58] God Paul Moses when he saw the will of
[55:03] God here's brother Ram saying this is
[55:05] the day of the manifestation it was the
[55:08] burning bush Pillar of Fire setting the
[55:11] day the time the season and the will of
[55:13] God and when he did this it's amazing to
[55:16] me because when you read the book of
[55:18] Hebrews the 11th chapter he said by
[55:21] Faith said what is Faith he said it's a
[55:24] revelation of the will of God and by
[55:28] faith
[55:30] Rahab and by the will of God
[55:34] Moses and by the will of God Abraham and
[55:38] by the will of God
[55:39] Samson and by the will of God and here
[55:43] is a continuation of the book of Hebrews
[55:46] when the heroes didn't end in the book
[55:48] of Hebrews but so are some of you
[55:51] tonight and by faith you shall
[55:54] overcome
[55:55] I'll say this to you tonight I'll say
[55:58] that you know some hindrances but your
[56:00] faith don't know
[56:06] any the gates of hell are against
[56:10] you Jesus said they would
[56:13] be but he also said we would
[56:17] Prevail that the Gates of Hell will not
[56:20] Prevail against you you see they will be
[56:23] against you amen but they won't they
[56:26] won't Prevail against you the gates of
[56:29] hell now watch when you when you see
[56:31] this it actually brings a reality that
[56:35] when God sets a promise in front of a
[56:38] Believer and they know they're going
[56:40] after a promise made to them by the
[56:44] Lord there is no stopping that
[56:49] believer there will be no stopping that
[56:52] believer when you see that your
[56:55] inheritance is
[56:57] sunship and that it was predestinated of
[56:59] the Lord that it was paid for by the
[57:02] blood of Jesus that your name was put in
[57:04] the Lamb's Book and this message has
[57:07] come to Proclaim declare to shout aloud
[57:11] to you that you're are returning to your
[57:16] sunship there'll be no stopping that
[57:20] one amen be like a house of fire on a
[57:23] windy day be no stopping that because
[57:27] they go straight into action can our
[57:29] music players come
[57:31] tonight there'll be no stopping that
[57:33] that's
[57:35] right there'll be
[57:38] none I've got a section here on purpose
[57:40] I better not get into it I'll be an
[57:43] hour when you see it's the plan you see
[57:47] it's the
[57:48] purpose see inheritance yes sir is
[57:51] purpose nothing can destroy
[57:55] destroy the purpose of
[57:59] God is't that amazing when you see his
[58:03] will there's no wind that can blow out
[58:06] the
[58:06] fire there's no Beast that can eat the
[58:10] believer there's no there's no water
[58:14] that can drown her there's no fire that
[58:16] can burn
[58:17] her there's no death that can destroy
[58:19] her there's no devil that can stop
[58:23] her
[58:25] because it's our
[58:28] inheritance so brother Levi there's a
