========================================

Follow a star to a place unexpected. Would you believe after all we've projected a child in a manger? Lowly and small. The weakest of all, unlikeest hero wrapped in his mother's should just a child. Is this who we've waited for? How many kings stepped down from their thrones? How many lords have abandoned their homes? How many graves have become the least for me? Yes. How many gods have poured out their hearts to romance a world that is all torn apart? How many fathers gave up their sons for me? Bringing our gifts for the young savior. All that we have, whether costly or meek, because we believe. Gold for his honor and frankincense for his pleasure and my for the cross he'll suffer. Do you believe? Is this who we've waited for? How many kings stepped down from their thrones? How many lords have abandoned their homes? How many great have become the least for me? How many gods have poured out their hearts to romance a world that is all torn apart? How many fathers gave up their sons for me? Only one did that for me. All for you. All for me. All for you. off for me. How many kings stepped down from their thrones? How many lords have abandoned their homes? How many greats have become the least for me? How many gods have poured out their hearts to romance a world that is all torn apart? How many fathers gave up their sons for me? Only one did that for me.
