[43:21] that'll that'll lift up this message not
[43:23] as a cultural uh Gathering not as a
[43:26] Creed not as a Association of churches

[43:40] hearts and opening up the expression of
[43:42] what was in his mind before the

[43:49] so precious amen and I'm I'm more
[43:52] confident than ever I'm more excited
[43:54] than ever about this message amen and
[43:56] the knowledge the faith amen the belief
[43:59] that that no matter what comes no matter
[44:01] how dark the world gets this message
[44:03] will shine on and there's a new
[44:04] generation that will sweep it on not
[44:07] another message he said they'll sweep
[44:08] this message on to the coming of the
[44:11] Lord hallelujah and and I just want this
[44:14] Youth Camp and to be something that will
[44:17] lift up the message and establish the
[44:19] new generation in the word of the hour
[44:21] Hallelujah we want to we want to first
[44:23] of all just thank the ministry and I
[44:26] think the brothers are watching tonight
[44:27] how many want to express your
[44:28] appreciation to brother Timothy brother
[44:30] Ron and brother
[44:32] Andrew
[44:35] hallelujah amen amen God bless those
[44:41] Brothers amen we've got so much love and
[44:44] so much gratitude for these men of God
[44:46] that have come and just the way they've
[44:48] uh you know I just was marveling the way
[44:50] that that the Lord operated his servants
[44:52] this weekend and and tried to it's just
[44:55] so hard to put into words tried to a
[44:56] little bit over the weekend but just to
[44:58] see how how God has has has has given us
[45:02] these men of God these last three years
[45:03] and brother Ron this year and the way
[45:05] that the way that they've not only
[45:07] brought their gifts and their Ministries
[45:10] which are powerful and they are
[45:11] wonderful but they've just have got
[45:13] behind the vision and I think that's the
[45:14] way it is everywhere around the world
[45:17] amongst the True Believers of this
[45:18] message there's a greater Vision to lift
[45:21] up the message Amen to build up the body
[45:23] of Christ the church Universal and it's
[45:25] been wonderful and just lift up the word
[45:27] and point our young people to the word
[45:29] and just to highlight a few things that
[45:31] were said I love how brother Andrew the
[45:33] his first statement out the gate
[45:35] Saturday night he said he said tonight
[45:37] he said get your Victory when you get
[45:39] your Victory get it from the preaching
[45:41] of the word amen and and uh we believe
[45:44] in Layon on in hands we we believe that
[45:46] God uses gifts we believe in
[45:48] Supernatural Works done by Supernatural
[45:50] Men by the quickening power amen but we
[45:53] know that if we're going to have a young
[45:54] people that are going to survive this
[45:56] age they got to be established on the
[45:58] word of God because the word of God Amen
[46:00] when it doesn't feel like camp meeting
[46:02] anymore when the emotion of it isn't
[46:04] there anymore when the group's not there
[46:05] when the preacher's not there this word
[46:07] will stand amen and the life is in it
[46:10] the power is in the word and so I so
[46:12] appreciate amen the ministry our young
[46:14] people have today and I wish we had the
[46:16] quality when I was a young person amen
[46:19] the the quality and the and the
[46:20] Revelation the and the the Dynamics and
[46:23] just the anointing of the ministry that
[46:25] we we have today amongst our young
[46:26] people's was a wonderful thing and we
[46:27] see the fruits of that Allelujah I love
[46:30] how he said that the message this
[46:31] message came and it not only did it come
[46:33] to tie up all the Loose Ends of Doctrine
[46:35] tie up all the Loose Ends of of
[46:37] revelation of the word but it can also
[46:39] loose you amen amen it tied up every
[46:42] loose end of this Bible but it Loos
[46:43] God's people to worship Him amen and God
[46:46] used brother Andrew in a mighty way in
[46:48] the ministry and in the prayer line and
[46:49] just just in personal prayer and uh as
[46:52] as he has many times before amongst us
[46:54] and so we appreciate him his gifts in
[46:57] his ministry and brother Timothy my
[46:59] brother Timothy you know this is the uh
[47:01] uh uh we were our youth were talking
[47:03] about the the last year Sunday and this
[47:05] year's Sunday I thought are are two of
[47:07] the best take-home keep the victory
[47:09] sermons ever preached amen just you know
[47:14] young people you get to a place where
[47:15] you just feel like uh you feel you feel
[47:17] that experience is leaving you or you're
[47:19] worried about losing your Victory go
[47:21] back and listen to what you were told
[47:23] amen you might have come in whipped but
[47:25] you left equipped amen
[47:27] Hallelujah I love how he brought out
[47:29] about the pool of Bethesda you know
[47:31] because many times when we when we uh
[47:34] many times young people will come to you
[47:36] know might come to a youth camp might
[47:37] come to a service and we hear a lot of
[47:40] testimonies we see God moving in certain
[47:42] ways on certain people and it puts a
[47:43] pressure on the young people amen with
[47:45] their need because well you know if
[47:48] God's going to do it he's going to do it
[47:49] this way he's going to have this man you
[47:51] know lay hands on me or he's going to
[47:53] have this one speak a word or this one's
[47:54] going to sing the right song or I got to
[47:56] be at this place or it's got to be that
[47:58] that type of a feeling and and there
[48:00] gets a pressure on you and I love how
[48:02] brother brother uh Timothy just hit that
[48:04] with the pool of Bethesda because here's
[48:06] a man laying there and he knew that his
[48:08] only hope was when the waters were
[48:09] stirred just a certain way and he had to
[48:11] be the fastest one to get to the pool
[48:12] and jump in and that was the way it was
[48:14] going to come then Here Comes
[48:18] Jesus and he says would you be made
[48:21] whole do you want to be whole do you
[48:24] want to be delivered do you want to be
[48:26] healed amen it's faith in the word of
[48:28] God and oh my Hallelujah it just was a
[48:31] just beautiful to me the way that God
[48:33] dovetailed the ministry together amen
[48:35] for our 21 and up uh we had the same
[48:38] experience where brother Aaron came uh
[48:41] uh the first afternoon and just shared a
[48:43] wonderful thought on just being patient
[48:45] as God unfolds his purpose in your life
[48:48] and then brother Samuel wasn't there
[48:49] that day he arrives the next afternoon
[48:51] and just and it just fit perfectly
[48:54] together and he continued on the same
[48:55] exact subject and God was just speaking
[48:57] to us over the weekend just in a
[48:59] supernatural way you know we don't
[49:00] coordinate those things and if we did we
[49:02] could not have done it that well and we
[49:04] could not have done it that well amen
[49:07] amen and then brother Ron
[49:09] Spencer uh just you know got to take a
[49:12] moment to think uh all of the years you
[49:16] know that I went to youth camps and how
[49:18] definitive and how effective over those
[49:21] years that brother Ron Spencer's
[49:22] Ministry was in my life I think the
[49:25] first time I danced in the spirit
[49:26] brother Ron might have been preaching
[49:28] and definitely several of
[49:30] them and many deliverances and things
[49:33] over the years and just to think that
[49:35] that we would be standing here over this
[49:36] past weekend and have brother Ron be
[49:38] preaching to our to our young people
[49:40] what a wonderful thing amen and and you
[49:43] know just to see behind the scenes you
[49:44] know brother Ron is fighting a real
[49:46] battle in his body as we're all aware
[49:48] amen and this Satan was really on the
[49:50] attack this past weekend amen and
[49:52] brother Ron really truly poured himself
[49:55] out to support our young people Amen to
[49:59] do it and and you know what it was
[50:02] just you just you you ought have been
[50:05] there there at the end when when the
[50:08] young people were just gathered around
[50:09] him I tell you history was made and I'm
[50:13] just glad I could be a part of that
[50:15] moment aren't you Hallelujah I tell you
[50:18] we saw so much so much victory in that
[50:24] service you know I just wonderful he
[50:27] shared some things in his heart about
[50:28] how you know even 20 years ago he'd
[50:30] preached on that Campground and and uh
[50:33] just you know and then you see uh this
[50:35] weekend it just it felt right amen it
[50:38] felt right it was wonderful so we want
[50:39] to say to brother Ron if you're watching
[50:41] we love you brother Ron and we're
[50:43] praying for you we thank you so
[50:51] much
[50:52] amen amen you know the the Lord told
[50:55] brother Ron he said if you trust me I'll
[50:58] use you like never before and I'm just
[51:00] grateful that that our youth camp could
[51:02] be a chapter in that story amen of of a
[51:05] of a man just beating the Daylights out
[51:08] of stage four cancer praise the Lord
[51:11] amen you know God has put great gifts in
[51:13] his body great gifts in his body you
[51:16] know he he came and he and he sent gifts
[51:18] unto man and uh and we need those things
[51:22] our young people need those things we
[51:23] they need to see them in operation they
[51:25] need to see God using gifts using
[51:27] because what it does it sets an example
[51:29] it puts something in a young person's
[51:30] heart say Lord let me find my purpose
[51:32] Lord how let use me let me reach my
[51:35] potentials let the things that you
[51:36] placed in me that I'm not even aware of

[51:40] you know you say well brother Nathan we
[51:42] got the word we don't need gifts but

[55:12] two-thirds of the time of a 7-hour
[55:14] service on Saturday maintaining that

[55:21] atmosphere where God could move what a
[55:23] what a powerful Ministry what a
[55:26] sacrifice you know they pour themselves
[55:28] physically and just all their gifts and
[55:29] talents like I said you know you can
[55:31] measure an artist in two ways and either
[55:34] by his talents or by his anointing and
[55:36] some have just one and some have just
[55:38] the
[55:39] other but we weren't lacking in either

[1:11:57] off well
[1:12:00] um um so um I had been struggling a lot
[1:12:05] with battles and stuff
[1:12:10] and and
[1:12:12] um I on Saturday night the preaching was
[1:12:16] just exactly it was just like God was
[1:12:19] speaking to me and I was in the prayer
[1:12:23] line and I was just thinking
[1:12:26] okay I'm done like I'm I'm ready I'm
[1:12:28] ready for this to be over and I'm just
[1:12:32] and the devil had been just fighting me
[1:12:35] a lot and I felt like he had taken my
[1:12:37] dance and I wanted a refilling of the
[1:12:41] Holy Ghost too
[1:12:43] and um I saw so many people getting
[1:12:46] their victories and stuff and I walked
[1:12:50] up there and brother Andrew kind of just
[1:12:53] smiled at me and he was like you're
[1:12:55] ready aren't
[1:12:56] you
[1:12:58] and he started praying for me and he
[1:13:02] said fill her again and again and again
[1:13:06] and I got a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:08] and then he told me to stand up and
[1:13:11] stomp on that devil one more time and I
[1:13:13] danced out of the prayer
[1:13:23] line and then and I was um out for a
[1:13:28] little bit already and I saw Bethany
[1:13:30] hugging Reagan Spencer and I walked past
[1:13:34] and Bethany was speaking in tongues and
[1:13:37] she kind of held out her hand like she
[1:13:39] wanted me to come over and she kind of
[1:13:42] brought me in for a hug and as she was
[1:13:44] speaking tongues I kept hearing I love
[1:13:46] you
[1:13:52] Ella and it was just like God was
[1:13:54] telling me he love me
[1:13:57] amen hallelujah
[1:14:02] hallelujah praise the Lord praise the
[1:14:07] Lord Brother Bram said that's true
[1:14:09] scriptural tongues when somebody
[1:14:11] speaking but you're hearing it in your
[1:14:12] own language and
[1:14:14] amen he still does it he anybody else
[1:14:19] testimony down through here our young
[1:14:22] people anybody who we got
[1:14:26] all right sister
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:34] Ellie coming into Camp I was trying to
[1:14:36] figure out what it was that I truly
[1:14:38] wanted the Lord to deliver me
[1:14:41] from and I was praying and asking God to
[1:14:43] reveal it to me and he
[1:14:44] did Tuesday night before camp we had a
[1:14:47] prayer meeting at the barfields and I
[1:14:49] was as I was praying the Lord revealed
[1:14:51] something from my past that I thought I
[1:14:53] had work through and dissolved but
[1:14:55] clearly I hadn't so I prayed that the
[1:14:57] Lord would deliver me from it so skipped
[1:14:59] to Saturday night and the Lord had
[1:15:02] already done so much for me but I was
[1:15:04] still fighting with my past so I decided
[1:15:07] to go through the prayer line and I was
[1:15:09] about three people out and the devil
[1:15:11] started fighting
[1:15:13] me he tried to tell me that there were
[1:15:16] so many more people with such bigger
[1:15:18] needs than I
[1:15:20] had that what I was dealing with really
[1:15:22] wasn't that big of a deal and it was so
[1:15:25] bad that I nearly went and sat down but
[1:15:28] something in me told me that no matter
[1:15:30] how big or small your need is God cares
[1:15:32] just as much and I knew that the devil
[1:15:35] was fighting
[1:15:36] me and the reason he was fighting me so
[1:15:38] hard was because I was about to be
[1:15:41] free I got to the line and brother
[1:15:43] Andrew put his hand on my head and he
[1:15:46] said you've been through a lot and now
[1:15:48] you get to experience it another thing
[1:15:51] I'd been fighting was to be free enough
[1:15:54] in the Lord that I could dance and jump
[1:15:55] in his spirit and when brother Andrew
[1:15:57] said that to me the chains broke and I
[1:15:59] danced and jumped out of the prayer
[1:16:01] line I was writing this down tonight and
[1:16:05] I was laying on the floor in so much
[1:16:08] pain I had never felt this much pain in
[1:16:11] my back
[1:16:12] before and I was trying to decide
[1:16:14] whether or not I was going to share it
[1:16:16] and it was just confirmation the devil
[1:16:18] had never fought me this hard trying to
[1:16:20] get me to keep my testimony to myself so
[1:16:24] I just just thank the Lord for what he
[1:16:26] did for
[1:16:30] me glory to
[1:16:36] God okay sister
[1:16:43] Zoe
[1:16:44] well I could go way back in my testimony
[1:16:48] but I'll keep it to
[1:16:49] Camp
[1:16:52] um since we've moved here just real
[1:16:55] quick the Lord has helped me slowly to
[1:16:58] heal from a lot of things and um he's
[1:17:01] delivered me from a lot of
[1:17:03] anxiety um things that I was holding on
[1:17:06] to um but for Camp I was trying to pray
[1:17:10] for specific things um and he spoke to
[1:17:15] me several times through sermons as I
[1:17:17] Was preparing my heart for um this the
[1:17:20] services this weekend um and it just had
[1:17:25] me with my eyes and my ears open waiting
[1:17:28] to see what the Lord would say to
[1:17:30] me so um on Thursday night something
[1:17:35] happened that really shook me and um
[1:17:40] kind of made my knees knock a little
[1:17:42] bit and I I knew it was for a reason I
[1:17:46] knew the Lord had planned it just that
[1:17:48] way to bring some more healing into my
[1:17:52] life uh Thursday night Bethany came came
[1:17:55] and prayed for me and she spoke just
[1:17:58] everything that I was thinking and
[1:17:59] everything that I was struggling with in
[1:18:01] my heart and so each night after that I
[1:18:05] just prayed like Lord I want you to help
[1:18:08] me be free of all this I want to let it
[1:18:10] go um because I'm the kind of person
[1:18:12] that likes to try to help God and hold
[1:18:15] on to things cuz he has so much to
[1:18:18] do so I KN I knew that wasn't right but
[1:18:22] I just couldn't let go on my own
[1:18:25] so Saturday night came and before the
[1:18:29] prayer line was even called or before
[1:18:30] they even said anything about it I
[1:18:32] determined in my heart I was going to go
[1:18:34] because I knew if I didn't then that I
[1:18:37] wouldn't so as soon as they said for
[1:18:40] people to start land up I went and the
[1:18:43] whole prayer line I fought I had a pit
[1:18:44] in my stomach I I kept wanted to go sit
[1:18:48] down but I knew I needed to
[1:18:50] stay and then I got up into the front of
[1:18:53] the line and I saw it go
[1:18:55] through and I saw so many people that I
[1:18:58] loved go through and get their
[1:19:01] Victory and then it was my turn and I
[1:19:04] went in and brother Wayne and brother
[1:19:07] Andrew just the Lord just his Spirit
[1:19:10] flowed through them and I felt myself
[1:19:13] let go and I felt myself give it to God
[1:19:17] everything that I was holding on
[1:19:19] to
[1:19:20] and in my letting go I felt felt such a
[1:19:25] peace and I felt God's love like I've
[1:19:27] never felt it ever in my life he felt so
[1:19:30] real it felt like he was walking around
[1:19:32] touching us and praying for
[1:19:34] us and I just I had no strength my my
[1:19:38] physical strength gave out and I think
[1:19:40] shyenne had to carry me off and set me
[1:19:44] down and just for the rest of the night
[1:19:46] and into Sunday I felt so much peace and
[1:19:49] I felt like I was floating I felt his
[1:19:52] presence like never before and I'm just
[1:19:54] I'm so thankful for everything you did
[1:19:55] there's there's so many other stories
[1:19:57] but
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:04] that's all right
[1:20:10] sister so um I had come to Camp like
[1:20:13] wanting a really like u a deep
[1:20:15] experience with the Lord so um there was
[1:20:19] something like holding me back almost
[1:20:21] from like getting to that point so on
[1:20:24] Thursday brother Timothy had brought out
[1:20:26] like
[1:20:27] forgiveness and there was it just like
[1:20:30] deal with my heart on that
[1:20:34] and there was someone that just I could
[1:20:37] not forgive and
[1:20:39] um I went to The
[1:20:42] Altar and just like I felt so much I I
[1:20:46] just gave it to the Lord like God you
[1:20:48] have to take this like I can't just be
[1:20:51] like hating them all the time cuz I did
[1:20:53] not I don't want to do do that at all
[1:20:55] and so I was able to forgive them and I
[1:20:58] have peace about that situation with
[1:21:00] them and
[1:21:04] um and so that's like what was holding
[1:21:07] me back from like my full deliverance
[1:21:09] and so on Saturday I went in the prayer
[1:21:11] line wanting freedom from all this stuff
[1:21:15] like I had gone through and um a real
[1:21:18] genuine and experience so in the prayer
[1:21:20] line as brother Andrew Sor prayed I was
[1:21:22] able to break through and started like
[1:21:25] just jumping and praising the Lord for
[1:21:27] like bringing me through and I was able
[1:21:29] to have some great Liberty and freedom

[1:24:33] a while ago and I've repented for and I
[1:24:38] just want to say I've repented over
[1:24:41] those things and I know they're under
[1:24:43] the blood and I know I have the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost and I just want to say that I have
[1:24:48] the
[1:24:51] victory that one about do not pass me by
[1:24:54] can you tell that
[1:24:56] part okay yeah so actually um so on I
[1:25:02] didn't really come to camp with like a
[1:25:04] specific need
[1:25:07] um but on Thursday night I was sitting
[1:25:11] in service and I was just so
[1:25:14] distracted
[1:25:16] and I just I I just wanted to leave I
[1:25:20] wanted to just go to the bathroom and
[1:25:23] just and
[1:25:25] I was just really
[1:25:28] fighting um just being distracted in
[1:25:31] that service
[1:25:33] and
[1:25:35] I um the minister said the devil just
[1:25:39] wants you to get up and go to the
[1:25:40] bathroom so I was like okay I'm not
[1:25:42] going to go to the
[1:25:44] bathroom um but so I just stayed there I
[1:25:48] still didn't really I don't really
[1:25:51] remember what that service was about but
[1:25:54] um I just stayed and then at the end of
[1:25:56] the service I was just like I you can
[1:26:00] either leave a service
[1:26:02] getting further away from God or closer
[1:26:05] to God and I was just like I can't leave
[1:26:09] being further away from God and so I
[1:26:12] decided to go up to the front even
[1:26:15] though I didn't feel like it and so I
[1:26:18] went up to the front and I was just my
[1:26:21] heart's cry was Lord Don't Pass Me Me
[1:26:25] by and I really wanted um brother Andrew
[1:26:30] to pray for me cuz I wanted him to pray
[1:26:32] for me at my camp and he never did and
[1:26:35] it was just I also wanted that to happen
[1:26:38] and so I just I started praying and
[1:26:40] brother Dwayne Lawson came and he
[1:26:42] started praying for me and I just I I
[1:26:46] just lifted my hands and brother Andrew
[1:26:48] Spencer comes over and he grabbed my
[1:26:50] hand and he said you have the victory
[1:26:52] sister
[1:26:54] and then do not pass me by starts
[1:26:57] playing and then brother Dwayne Lawson
[1:26:59] starts laughing and he looks at me in my
[1:27:01] eyes and he
[1:27:02] says no human could have planned that
[1:27:04] sister do you hear that and it was just
[1:27:07] so perfect cuz I I just
[1:27:10] wanted to to feel the Lord and have
[1:27:13] something so personal happen and it just
[1:27:16] goes to show you that he hears your
[1:27:17] prayers even when you don't feel like
[1:27:21] your prayers are being heard but he
[1:27:24] heard my heart's cry and it was it was
[1:27:26] just so
[1:27:28] [Applause]
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:35] special goad sister Faith
[1:27:38] an um so it started off Thursday night
[1:27:43] and he had an altar call and I went up
[1:27:46] to the Altar and I really just struggled
[1:27:48] with fear and um sister fleece asked us
[1:27:51] to write down a couple things that we
[1:27:53] wanted delivered from and so I had fear
[1:27:56] and I wanted a refilling the Holy Ghost
[1:27:58] and I wanted more freedom and a realer
[1:28:00] experience with him and um I went up to
[1:28:03] the altar on um Thursday and I just
[1:28:08] knelt down and prayed I was there for
[1:28:09] maybe like 30 minutes and um I believe
[1:28:13] that it was gone but I was like Lord for
[1:28:14] a confirmation you will either let the
[1:28:16] song leader say something about fear or
[1:28:19] the minister that comes and prays me for
[1:28:21] me say something about fear and a couple
[1:28:23] minutes later none of those things
[1:28:25] happened so I was like Lord you'll just
[1:28:27] come down and you'll just speak to me
[1:28:30] and um no more than I said that the
[1:28:32] minister came and prayed for me and he
[1:28:34] said um may all fear be casted out and
[1:28:37] then he said give her refilling of the
[1:28:39] Holy Ghost no more than he said that the
[1:28:41] song leader said something about fear
[1:28:43] and then um tears started rolling down
[1:28:45] my face and I just believe that the Lord
[1:28:47] was really there and then um Friday and
[1:28:52] Saturday night it was just a real
[1:28:53] experience and I really got what I
[1:28:55] wanted and then um
[1:28:57] Sunday the Lord had the devil just
[1:29:01] really been on me and he was like well
[1:29:03] you didn't you got all you wanted you
[1:29:05] didn't you don't really need Freedom
[1:29:06] you're fine you got what you wanted and
[1:29:08] then brother Timothy started preaching
[1:29:10] about excuses and I was like okay you
[1:29:12] know devil I don't got what I want and
[1:29:15] um so that um that Sunday then after
[1:29:20] service everybody started getting the
[1:29:22] victory dance and I was like I want to
[1:29:24] be there too and after I got started I
[1:29:26] couldn't
[1:29:27] stop Hallelujah good
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:40] job sister felissa tell us about our
[1:29:43] list okay so um before Camp I was
[1:29:47] listening to last year's testimony
[1:29:49] service at this church and I felt led to
[1:29:52] write a list of everything that I wanted
[1:29:54] from Camp because I was I was super
[1:29:56] excited for this Camp I knew I was going
[1:29:58] to get everything that I wanted so I was
[1:30:00] like I'm going to write this down I'm
[1:30:01] going to write out like a pre-
[1:30:03] testimony so I
[1:30:05] wrote I wrote everything down and um and
[1:30:10] now I'm forgetting everything I was
[1:30:11] going to
[1:30:12] say and I came to Camp um and I Thursday
[1:30:17] and Friday services were phenomenal and
[1:30:19] they were really good but I didn't get
[1:30:20] what I wanted so I came to Saturday
[1:30:22] service and I was like I know this is my
[1:30:23] service
[1:30:24] service like this is going to be for me
[1:30:26] and I was really expecting from the Lord
[1:30:29] and I I went in the prayer line and the
[1:30:32] devil was fighting me but I was like I'm
[1:30:34] going to get this I know I'm going to
[1:30:35] get this and I went through the prayer
[1:30:36] line and I came out and I was more
[1:30:40] disappointed than I have ever been and I
[1:30:41] was like what went wrong because I had I
[1:30:44] had expected so much and I had tried to
[1:30:47] make sure everything in my life was
[1:30:49] lined up and I was like God what did I
[1:30:52] do wrong like why didn't I get what I
[1:30:55] came for so I'd been crying and I
[1:30:57] finally got up and I was like I'm gonna
[1:30:59] praise God anyway because that's
[1:31:00] something I can do no matter what so I
[1:31:03] praised God and while I was doing that I
[1:31:05] felt him like tell me just trust me
[1:31:08] tomorrow is your day and I was like but
[1:31:10] it's Sunday and that's like a victory
[1:31:11] service and but I was like at this point
[1:31:15] it's not it's not up to me it's up to
[1:31:17] God everything's up to God so I give it
[1:31:19] to you because all I can do left is
[1:31:21] trust God so I came into service Sunday
[1:31:24] and about eight minutes into the service
[1:31:26] brother Timothy starts preaching on
[1:31:27] everything that I had been praying for
[1:31:30] like it was amazing and I got delivered
[1:31:32] of so many things on my list and I was
[1:31:35] at the end of service and I was just
[1:31:37] thanking God for everything and then I
[1:31:38] realized I had I hadn't gotten
[1:31:40] everything on my list and I the devil
[1:31:42] was like you know what you're good you
[1:31:44] got most of it you can leave that's fine
[1:31:47] and I was like but my God can do all
[1:31:50] things so I am going to get all things
[1:31:53] so I went up I had a couple healings I
[1:31:56] hadn't received and I went up and I told
[1:31:58] the ministers and they prayed for me and
[1:32:01] I was I was healed like I got everything
[1:32:05] on my
[1:32:08] list glory to
[1:32:10] [Music]
[1:32:16] God um so I would just want to thank the
[1:32:20] Lord for uh giving me the holy ghost at
[1:32:22] camp
[1:32:24] um it was a real
[1:32:27] experience um I also want to thank the
[1:32:29] Lord for healing me of a disease called
[1:32:31] scoliosis praise the
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:42] Lord hallelujah I want to read one off
[1:32:44] of the website there before we come over
[1:32:47] and get some of these young boys
[1:32:48] involved
[1:32:51] but up here okay I won't I won't miss
[1:32:55] you this is uh from brother Eli cross
[1:32:57] and there are quite a few good
[1:32:58] testimonies posted on the website we we
[1:33:01] won't get to all of them tonight but
[1:33:03] this one really struck
[1:33:04] me he said for around a month before
[1:33:07] coming to twt he said I was facing the
[1:33:09] hardest battle I've ever fought I was
[1:33:11] fighting a lot of Mind battles and the
[1:33:13] devil just in my ear and really taking
[1:33:14] advantage of me being in a hurt and
[1:33:15] vulnerable spot I just didn't feel like
[1:33:18] living anymore I would lay at night just
[1:33:21] crying and crying until 1: to 2:00 a.m.
[1:33:23] and then I had to get up at 5:00 or 6:00
[1:33:24] a.m. for work I would just lay in bed
[1:33:26] and not want to get up and face another
[1:33:28] day because I just got to the point
[1:33:30] where I didn't even want to
[1:33:32] try on the way to and from work I would
[1:33:34] just drive as fast as I could just
[1:33:36] hoping something might happen like take
[1:33:38] a turn too fast or lose control I just
[1:33:40] lost purpose in my life so much I tried
[1:33:43] to follow God's will for me and watching
[1:33:44] things just fall through just made me
[1:33:46] lose Faith a lot of times I was thinking
[1:33:47] what's the point anymore when I try I
[1:33:50] just fail and I got to a place where I
[1:33:51] didn't read my Bible listen to tapes or
[1:33:53] music anymore I felt like every day
[1:33:55] could be my last that I wouldn't be able
[1:33:58] to make it and that I was just going to
[1:33:59] fail a lot of times I felt like I wasn't
[1:34:01] going to be able to keep the faith and
[1:34:02] would fall that I wasn't for the message
[1:34:04] that I was just meant to be one of them
[1:34:06] who came so close but couldn't make it I
[1:34:08] felt like I wasn't able to overcome and
[1:34:10] I wasn't going to make it through this
[1:34:12] trial coming in Camp I really didn't
[1:34:14] have any expectations I had so much
[1:34:16] doubt that I just came to Camp just to
[1:34:18] see friends cuz I didn't think anything
[1:34:20] would happen for me I came to Camp
[1:34:22] frustrated because I just didn't feel
[1:34:23] feel like it mattered enough what I was
[1:34:24] dealing with Thursday night I just sat
[1:34:27] in church and didn't feel like being
[1:34:28] there I just felt like I wasn't going to
[1:34:30] get anything but as we were singing
[1:34:32] during the song service I just started
[1:34:34] thinking I have the power to put myself
[1:34:36] into the atmosphere that's right for me
[1:34:38] to get a blessing God made me to praise
[1:34:41] him and getting into the right spirit
[1:34:43] will put me in tune for his word to have
[1:34:44] an impact in my life so I just started
[1:34:47] to praise and sing from my heart brother
[1:34:48] puit just walked right down my alley I
[1:34:50] felt like it was just me and him in
[1:34:52] there and he was just talking to me it
[1:34:54] gave me so much encouragement that it
[1:34:56] just turned around my whole attitude for
[1:34:57] the weekend and the services come Friday
[1:35:00] night I came with an expectation of
[1:35:01] getting my needs met and beating this
[1:35:03] month-long battle when the service came
[1:35:05] to an end and people were up in that
[1:35:06] circle on the pulpit I was up there in
[1:35:08] front of where the minister stood and
[1:35:09] when I was up there something just
[1:35:10] telling kept telling me to talk to
[1:35:12] brother Timothy about what was going on
[1:35:14] with me I kept pushing it off saying
[1:35:16] this wouldn't be the right time for it
[1:35:17] or the need I have isn't important
[1:35:19] enough to to matter telling him
[1:35:21] everything that was going on but I
[1:35:22] looked down at my hands they were just
[1:35:24] glistening with sweat I would wipe them
[1:35:25] off on my sleeves or my pant legs they
[1:35:27] would just be as sweaty as before and I
[1:35:28] knew that was because in myself I was
[1:35:30] battling whether or not to talk and pray
[1:35:32] about it so I just finally turned around
[1:35:34] and told him I told him everything I was
[1:35:36] feeling and going through for the past
[1:35:37] month I told him how I was shaking in my
[1:35:39] faith and I was just at the verge of
[1:35:41] completely falling apart and he told me
[1:35:43] he said those feelings are real and
[1:35:44] they're serious things but you just have
[1:35:47] to cast your burdens on him God has it
[1:35:49] in control lay your burdens down and
[1:35:52] walk free and then we prayed and God
[1:35:53] just brought his presence down and
[1:35:55] lifted those burdens off of me I fell to
[1:35:57] my knees and was just thanking him and
[1:35:58] glorifying for him everything he's done
[1:36:00] for me and as I got up and just stood
[1:36:02] there praying and thanking him brother
[1:36:03] puit got in my ear and said go Praise
[1:36:05] Him and thank him for everything he's
[1:36:06] done for you I just started jumping and
[1:36:08] shouting thanking God for everything
[1:36:10] he's done for me and always hearing my
[1:36:12] prayers and and that night I just saw
[1:36:14] God move on my need and Friday night God
[1:36:16] just turned the whole situation around
[1:36:18] and fix the whole thing he said I know
[1:36:20] it was of God because it could have only
[1:36:21] took God to make it happen I'm just so
[1:36:24] thankful that God cares and at the
[1:36:25] lowest and the weakest moments he
[1:36:27] reaches down and picks me up amen
[1:36:38] hallelujah
[1:36:39] amen he's got one more paragraph he said
[1:36:42] God has changed everything for me I've
[1:36:43] been at peace and the trial I face is
[1:36:45] lying Dead behind me now and I am
[1:36:47] walking in Victory and in faith that God
[1:36:49] is leading me I can't fail I can't fall
[1:36:52] and I can't fail because if he started
[1:36:54] it he has to finish it I can't remember
[1:36:57] who but one of the ministers talked
[1:36:58] about the story of the Israelites in the
[1:36:59] Red Sea and it just lined up with
[1:37:01] everything I felt I felt like the
[1:37:02] Israelites when they came to the Red Sea
[1:37:04] I was just thinking so much why would it
[1:37:05] be why would I be brought this far and
[1:37:07] God bring me through so much just for me
[1:37:09] to end up like this and fall short but
[1:37:11] at twt God split my Red Sea I walk
[1:37:15] through it this weekend and behind me is
[1:37:16] just a bunch of dead Egyptians I know
[1:37:18] God's taken me to my Promised Land it
[1:37:20] doesn't matter what may come my way I
[1:37:22] know where I have to finish and that's
[1:37:24] in glory
[1:37:33] amen go ahead sister
[1:37:36] Molly
[1:37:37] um so Friday night when brother Ron was
[1:37:40] preaching um he made the comment that if
[1:37:43] you don't have the Holy Ghost tonight
[1:37:46] Easter night I had a very strong desire
[1:37:49] that wouldn't leave me through the
[1:37:50] service because I just knew I didn't
[1:37:52] have it all I could focus on was that I
[1:37:56] almost just blocked everything else out
[1:37:59] and at the end I had raised my hand and
[1:38:02] when he had called everyone up to go I
[1:38:05] asked Cheyenne to go up with me uh we
[1:38:08] were up there singing and worshiping and
[1:38:10] when brother Ben started singing it
[1:38:12] ain't over yet the spirit hit me so
[1:38:16] strong and if I hadn't been holding on
[1:38:18] to Cheyenne I would have probably gone
[1:38:20] flat on my face and I just asked the
[1:38:23] Lord though before I had gone up to give
[1:38:25] me a confirmation that I got the Holy
[1:38:27] Ghost like I wanted to know without a
[1:38:30] doubt so as I was up there um I was just
[1:38:34] screaming out and the spirit had H me
[1:38:36] and all of a sudden Cheyenne bent down
[1:38:39] my ear and said um it's yours he told me
[1:38:42] to tell you that it's
[1:38:44] yours and I just screamed out that I
[1:38:46] want it and I knew without a doubt that
[1:38:49] I had gotten
[1:38:50] it and that was
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:39:03] and honestly I know I had not breathed a
[1:39:05] word to anyone about my confirmation
[1:39:07] like Cheyenne had no idea and for her
[1:39:10] the Lord just to use her like that um I
[1:39:13] talked to her after just to let her know
[1:39:15] you know but I just want to thank the
[1:39:17] Lord for that
[1:39:19] [Applause]
[1:39:27] um I didn't plan on getting up here uh
[1:39:30] but I know the camp was for the Youth
[1:39:33] and a lot of times as parents you know
[1:39:35] you're busy watching your kids or you're
[1:39:37] running around and my weekend my boys
[1:39:40] ended up I have three boys and they
[1:39:42] ended up being very wild and I think I
[1:39:45] maybe heard 10% of some of the services
[1:39:47] you know just being in and out and you
[1:39:49] know how it is as a parent and um so I I
[1:39:53] just was it I didn't go to Camp um with
[1:39:56] you know a major need on my heart or
[1:39:58] anything I just I wanted a closer walk
[1:40:00] with the Lord and um just to be in his
[1:40:03] presence and I felt like I was just I
[1:40:05] never got you know that chance to be
[1:40:07] there and um Saturday night I took the
[1:40:10] kids back to the
[1:40:11] camper and my husband got to be in
[1:40:14] church and the other ones and they all
[1:40:16] got an awesome Victory and I I was just
[1:40:18] so thankful for that and um I was just
[1:40:21] in the camper you know singing and just
[1:40:23] praising the Lord myself and
[1:40:26] um Sunday morning I uh got up my husband
[1:40:31] went to work and um I was there by
[1:40:34] myself with the kids and they were just
[1:40:36] being like so wild before church and I
[1:40:39] was like Lord like I I'm just going to
[1:40:40] go home like I I'm done like I I can't
[1:40:43] do anymore and I'm just I'm going to get
[1:40:45] in the car and I'm going to go home and
[1:40:47] I'm not going to go into church and like
[1:40:49] just like it was just so on my heart
[1:40:51] like no like you need to stay you know
[1:40:53] you've made it this far just make it a
[1:40:55] little longer so um I stayed and my dad
[1:40:58] took wco for me and I was just sitting
[1:41:01] in my seat it was before church started
[1:41:04] and the songs you guys were just playing
[1:41:06] up there and they were the exact songs
[1:41:08] that I was singing in the camper the
[1:41:10] night before and so I just had tears
[1:41:12] start streaming down my face CU I could
[1:41:14] just feel the presence of the Lord and
[1:41:18] um just you know that he
[1:41:20] cares and um
[1:41:23] brother Tim's message was just so
[1:41:25] amazing that morning and so
[1:41:28] encouraging and you know I just was just
[1:41:30] thinking about all the victories that
[1:41:32] had happened and all the things I had
[1:41:34] seen in my family and my friends take
[1:41:36] place and so um during the songs I just

[1:41:43] the lord for it and he gave me my
[1:41:44] victory dance that morning and I got to
[1:41:46] be up with the youth praising him as
[1:41:49] well so even if you know you feel like
[1:41:51] you're not able to be apart or not be in

[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] [Applause]
[1:45:24] so before Camp I knew that I was dealing
[1:45:26] with Spirits so I've been dealing with
[1:45:28] these Spirits for like four to five
[1:45:30] years and every single camp that I would
[1:45:32] go to I would go through the prayer
[1:45:34] lines get prayer and I would get the
[1:45:37] victory but only for like three to six
[1:45:39] months so I came into camp and I'm like
[1:45:41] I know this is the camp I'm going to get
[1:45:43] the victory so then Saturday night when
[1:45:47] I think it was brother Andrew Spencer
[1:45:49] was preaching and then before he started
[1:45:52] the prayer line he
[1:45:53] said you got to hate that Spirit yeah
[1:45:56] and come into the prayer line hating
[1:45:59] that spirit and you'll be delivered yeah
[1:46:01] so I came in hating it and I'm
[1:46:03] like it's gone it's all gone
[1:46:08] [Applause]
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:15] amen so for about a year I had been
[1:46:17] dealing with an addiction to my phone I
[1:46:20] just couldn't get over it and God
[1:46:22] delivered me on on Saturday thank
[1:46:27] God so uh about a year now I've been
[1:46:33] dealing with pornography and about two
[1:46:35] weeks before Camp my dad prayed through
[1:46:38] with me um while we're doing chores and
[1:46:41] so I went to Camp expecting to go
[1:46:45] through the rest of the way and get
[1:46:46] total deliverance and Thursday night
[1:46:49] brother Tim was talking about uh God's
[1:46:52] light coming down on our lives and
[1:46:54] erasing all those pictures that Satan
[1:46:55] had gotten of us when we'd Fallen I'm
[1:46:58] just claiming that
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:09] amen amen sister Kaitlin thank
[1:47:13] you so I didn't know I had a testimony
[1:47:17] until I was sitting here listening to
[1:47:18] everyone
[1:47:19] else's um I
[1:47:24] was there all camp and was for there for
[1:47:26] all the services and went through the
[1:47:28] prayer line and the entire Camp I didn't
[1:47:31] feel like I felt anything I didn't feel
[1:47:34] like I felt a victory or not or anything
[1:47:38] like that I didn't go through with like
[1:47:39] a spec specific expectation I had a few
[1:47:43] things on my heart but while I was
[1:47:46] sitting here listening to the
[1:47:48] testimonies uh the Lord reminded me of
[1:47:50] something that he had revealed to me
[1:47:53] uh on Saturday night while I was
[1:47:55] listening to
[1:47:57] service and a spirit that is a familial
[1:48:01] spirit in my family that was passed down
[1:48:04] to
[1:48:05] me and I believe that the Lord healed me
[1:48:09] of it
[1:48:11] and it's obviously been I've been I'm 23
[1:48:14] years old I've been dealing with it my
[1:48:15] whole life and didn't even know what it
[1:48:17] was called I didn't know
[1:48:21] what why
[1:48:23] and the Lord healed me of
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:28] [Applause]
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:35] it I thank the dorm leaders but I forgot
[1:48:38] to think our night guards brother Johnny
[1:48:40] and sister Caitlyn are so faithful and
[1:48:42] just uh just a a staple of the camp keep
[1:48:46] things orderly after night and we really
[1:48:47] appreciate the night guards and they go
[1:48:50] without sleep
[1:48:57] so a couple days before Camp I had wrote
[1:48:59] a few things down that were heavy on my
[1:49:01] heart every single service the Lord
[1:49:03] would come down in such a special and
[1:49:05] personal way and answer one of my needs
[1:49:08] by the time Camp was over everything on
[1:49:10] my list had been answered Thursday night
[1:49:12] before church I read Isaiah 55
[1:49:15] 11-13 so shall my word be that goeth
[1:49:17] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:49:19] return unto me void but it shall
[1:49:21] accomplish that which I plead
[1:49:23] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[1:49:25] to I sent it for ye shall go out with
[1:49:27] joy and be led forth with peace the
[1:49:29] mountains and the hills shall Break
[1:49:31] Forth before you into singing and all
[1:49:33] the trees of the field shall clap their
[1:49:34] hands instead of the thorn shall come up
[1:49:37] the fur tree and instead of the Brier
[1:49:39] shall come up come up the Myrtle tree
[1:49:41] and it shall be to the Lord for a name
[1:49:43] for an everlasting sign that shall not
[1:49:45] be cut off those scriptures were
[1:49:47] fulfilled by the time Camp was over
[1:49:50] those giants that had been tormenting me
[1:49:52] are d destroyed Saturday night was
[1:49:54] Unforgettable before church I had prayed
[1:49:56] about something that's bothered me for a
[1:49:58] few years and the devil would bring it
[1:50:00] up at random times and usually it was
[1:50:03] when my spiritual life was really good
[1:50:05] and it would make me so incredibly
[1:50:06] anxious when brother Andrew said that
[1:50:08] the scripture that was written for Judas
[1:50:10] is not for me and to flip the page I
[1:50:13] felt something leave right there that
[1:50:15] spirit is completely gone as I was
[1:50:18] nearing the prayer line every step I
[1:50:20] would take I was stomping on that stupid
[1:50:23] devil that was tormenting me and my
[1:50:24] family the anointing was so strong I've
[1:50:27] never felt his presence like that before
[1:50:29] I went through the prayer line and the
[1:50:31] Lord delivered me of everything the
[1:50:32] devil had been bothering me with I've
[1:50:35] taken my Mountain I've stepped on the
[1:50:37] neck of those Devils that were

[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:51:52] [Music]
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:52:01] thank you Lord um Saturday night I was
[1:52:03] just sitting there before the prayer
[1:52:05] line just uh praying to myself I just I
[1:52:07] knew there was there was something in my
[1:52:10] spirit that just wasn't right and I
[1:52:11] didn't quite know what it was but I knew
[1:52:14] I know the god that we serve so I just
[1:52:16] kind of sat there at my seat just
[1:52:18] praying to God that I knew that you know
[1:52:20] he could take whatever it was and when I
[1:52:22] went through the prayer line um brother
[1:52:25] Matt and Isaac
[1:52:27] Hatfield both at the same time they just
[1:52:30] they laid their hands on me and I just
[1:52:32] remember them just praying over me that
[1:52:34] all these complexes would leave and it
[1:52:37] just there was so much that happened cuz
[1:52:40] I didn't even realize that was what was
[1:52:43] what was holding me and just in a light
[1:52:46] switch just like this unreal just
[1:52:50] lifting I don't even know how to explain
[1:52:52] it but it was just it was all gone right
[1:52:54] then and
[1:52:55] there and uh I got back to my seat and
[1:52:58] after Chloe got got back to her seat
[1:53:01] after a while I just began to tell her
[1:53:04] you know what the Lord did for me and it
[1:53:06] was just this unreal just presence just
[1:53:08] moving thank you Lord and just when it
[1:53:11] seemed like you know I it's kind of
[1:53:13] coming back to reality I guess then
[1:53:17] brother Isaac and and Noah Flory came by
[1:53:19] and then begin to tell them and then it
[1:53:22] was just another moving and that it was
[1:53:25] just it was so powerful and then once
[1:53:27] again I kind of just started coming to
[1:53:29] and I was like man I really want to tell
[1:53:31] brother Matt what happened and I was
[1:53:35] just passed out on my chair with my head
[1:53:37] lifted up and as soon as I opened my
[1:53:39] eyes brother Matt just came out of
[1:53:41] nowhere and he just laid his hands on me
[1:53:43] and then just another just super natural
[1:53:46] moving it was just it was something that
[1:53:50] I I cannot even fa them to explain how
[1:53:54] wonderful it was and that presence was
[1:53:57] just so real it it honestly it didn't
[1:54:00] get any stronger or any less than till
[1:54:04] about 4 in the morning that night I was
[1:54:06] just I've never been able to just leave
[1:54:08] church and just feel that same presence
[1:54:11] as I just went to the snack bar to get
[1:54:13] some food and go and do devotions in my
[1:54:16] dorm and just sitting there in bed and I
[1:54:18] know like Nathan said the dorm leaders
[1:54:21] we're tired
[1:54:23] and I knew I knew I was tired and I'm
[1:54:25] sitting there in bed like why can't I go
[1:54:27] to sleep and it was just this unreal
[1:54:30] peace and joy that that God just gave me
[1:54:34] and I I just I thank God because I'm I'm
[1:54:36] still resting in that joy and that
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:40] [Applause]
[1:54:48] peace um I hadn't planned on saying
[1:54:51] anything but I know there's no testimony
[1:54:54] too small and I don't think mine was
[1:54:55] really small at
[1:54:57] all
[1:54:58] um for a while I've been
[1:55:03] uh I've been battling
[1:55:06] nervousness and uh so many things would
[1:55:10] bother me and other people's um problems
[1:55:15] and just little things here and there
[1:55:17] and I would just start shaking all over
[1:55:20] and
[1:55:24] I didn't even realize it I just thought
[1:55:26] that that was me I just thought that was
[1:55:29] a part of me you know and um leading up
[1:55:33] to Camp it was um uh
[1:55:38] Wednesday I I was I was trying to pack
[1:55:41] and get ready for camp and everything
[1:55:42] and I just couldn't get my thoughts
[1:55:45] together I was just a nervous wreck and
[1:55:49] um I I I realized that it was the devil
[1:55:53] it was the devil trying to make me
[1:55:55] nervous and not be able to look forward
[1:55:58] to Camp uh because being around a lot of
[1:56:01] people it it would make me
[1:56:04] nervous and
[1:56:06] um
[1:56:08] so I uh I get to camp and I'm all all
[1:56:14] day uh
[1:56:15] Friday I I I was just dealing with that
[1:56:18] nervous feeling the same thing that I
[1:56:20] was dealing with the whole week before
[1:56:23] and I
[1:56:24] uh I I went to Mariah and Seth's or
[1:56:28] Mariah Cavanaugh's room and I just I was
[1:56:30] just like I just need to go sit down by
[1:56:32] myself I I can't deal with all these
[1:56:34] people I just need to go sit and I was
[1:56:37] just so nervous and
[1:56:39] um so Saturday the prayer line started
[1:56:44] and I was like I don't have anything to
[1:56:45] go up for you know I'm fine and you know
[1:56:49] just everything that the devil tries to
[1:56:50] tell you and and um so I get in the
[1:56:54] prayer line and um and I was just
[1:56:58] thinking I haven't always been like this
[1:57:01] this isn't actually
[1:57:04] me um it's the devil trying to keep me
[1:57:07] from being who I'm supposed to
[1:57:10] be and uh and leading up to everything I
[1:57:14] was I was trying to figure out who I
[1:57:17] needed to be for before the Lord and use
[1:57:21] um just I just wanted to be in
[1:57:23] in used by him and I just wanted to let
[1:57:27] go and be free and just just whatever he
[1:57:31] needed me to be just let me be that and
[1:57:34] I real I realized I couldn't be that if
[1:57:36] I didn't let go of of of this nervous
[1:57:39] feeling that was keeping me back from so
[1:57:41] many things from being around people and
[1:57:43] having
[1:57:44] joy and so I I I I went through the the
[1:57:51] the prayer line
[1:57:53] and uh one brother on one side of me I
[1:57:55] don't know who it was but he said you
[1:57:59] haven't always been like this and the
[1:58:02] other brother on the other side said you
[1:58:04] don't have to fear
[1:58:07] anything and that's whenever I got my
[1:58:11] victory
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:19] so so after c after camp and everything
[1:58:23] I was feeling a lot better and you know
[1:58:25] how the devil's like oh will it only
[1:58:28] lasts for a day or it'll be back or you
[1:58:31] know something like that and uh me and
[1:58:33] Levi were talking and something came up
[1:58:36] where it would have that subject would
[1:58:39] have made me nervous and I look over at
[1:58:41] him and he looks at me and he's
[1:58:45] like you're you're you're
[1:58:49] okay and I was like yep
[1:58:52] [Applause]

[2:00:42] like it was nothing with what I was like
[2:00:44] thinking at all and I'm like I'm like
[2:00:47] God I'm like did you get something wrong
[2:00:50] and he's like he's like like he's like
[2:00:52] no just wait and out of nowhere Here
[2:00:55] Comes brother Matt and he just sticks
[2:00:57] his hands on me and he literally prays
[2:00:59] everything I was thinking about just
[2:01:01] like right there and so I'm like okay so
[2:01:04] I was like I mean I was happy and then
[2:01:07] the prayer line came and uh brother
[2:01:09] Andrew he he told us he's like get your
[2:01:11] Victory through the word because he's
[2:01:13] like when the um preachers leave and the
[2:01:15] anointing leaves he's like you'll still
[2:01:17] have your Victory through the word amen
[2:01:19] so I'm like okay so I'm like I'm taking
[2:01:21] my victory through the word word and
[2:01:23] then I went uh through the prayer line
[2:01:24] and felt absolutely nothing and I was
[2:01:27] like what I'm like I'm I was supposed to
[2:01:30] get something so I'm like so I sat there
[2:01:33] and prayed for like I don't know how
[2:01:35] long but then somebody came and they're
[2:01:37] like all I can remember is like it's not
[2:01:39] in vain so I was like okay so I'm like
[2:01:43] all I can do at this point is so I went
[2:01:46] back to the dorm and I'm like I ain't
[2:01:49] going to uh stop I'm like I can just
[2:01:51] pray God for it ahead of time so Sunday
[2:01:54] I didn't hold back at all I just let
[2:01:56] loose and kind of just felt as free as I
[2:02:00] could feel and then um I have to go po
[2:02:03] post Camp to get the full testimony so I
[2:02:07] was
[2:02:09] um I called a buddy that I like never
[2:02:12] call like ever like I never call him and
[2:02:15] I just called him up and I'm like hey
[2:02:16] are you busy and we were just having
[2:02:18] normal conversation and we were about to
[2:02:19] hang up and um
[2:02:23] neither of us hung up and we're like
[2:02:25] okay so then we like started on a
[2:02:27] different conversation and it uh turned
[2:02:29] totally around and uh we we end up
[2:02:31] giving our testimonies to each other and
[2:02:34] uh we just felt like the Lord just come
[2:02:36] in in the conversation it was it was a
[2:02:38] supernatural
[2:02:50] thing so I didn't go to Camp uh with
[2:02:53] anything in particular but that didn't
[2:02:54] mean I wasn't ready to get something so
[2:02:58] uh it's funny I told my I was thinking
[2:03:01] you know being in the atmosphere makes
[2:03:02] you hungry for something so after
[2:03:04] Thursday night service I uh I was
[2:03:07] walking back from something and I was
[2:03:10] keenly aware that I had been carrying
[2:03:12] around condemnation in my heart and I'd
[2:03:14] wake up in the mornings and just felt
[2:03:16] this weight and it was like hard to do
[2:03:18] life you know you just like you wake up
[2:03:21] like h
[2:03:23] I don't really want to get moving right
[2:03:24] now because it was just it was pressing
[2:03:25] down on me and I had been putting up
[2:03:27] with it for I don't even know how long I
[2:03:29] mean years years years so I thought well
[2:03:32] that's something to get rid of
[2:03:37] let's so uh it's just another
[2:03:40] liability uh
[2:03:42] so uh you know and I didn't necessarily
[2:03:46] I I went up when brother Ron had
[2:03:47] everybody come to the to the front just
[2:03:49] sincerely and nothing in particular
[2:03:51] happened um but uh the next morning I
[2:03:54] was talking to brother Matt McClaren
[2:03:56] just kind of sharing some things with
[2:03:57] him and he encouraged me he like you got
[2:03:59] a fight brother like you got to do some
[2:04:01] battle here and and it really lifted
[2:04:04] that weight off me and I realized okay
[2:04:05] I've I've just got to do some Warfare
[2:04:08] right
[2:04:09] now well Saturday night I Natalie asked
[2:04:12] me to go through the prayer line with
[2:04:13] her and I'm a good husband so I did and
[2:04:15] uh we were walking up at the prayer line
[2:04:17] and I thought well I'm going up here
[2:04:19] let's let's get something out of this
[2:04:20] right uh uh and I I had been diagnosed
[2:04:23] with Hashimoto's disease earlier this
[2:04:26] year uh and I'd never been prayed for
[2:04:29] for that and so I thought all right I
[2:04:31] I'll I'll receive my healing here and um
[2:04:34] I just I God gave me just a simple Faith
[2:04:36] like I'm going to go through the prayer
[2:04:38] line I'm going to obey the word and I'm
[2:04:39] going to be healed and it's that simple
[2:04:42] and so uh and usually I don't make
[2:04:44] things simple so that's a miracle in of
[2:04:47] itself so uh I I went through the prayer
[2:04:50] line and and they started praying for me
[2:04:51] me for for fear and then brother Matt
[2:04:54] just grabbed me and started praying
[2:04:56] fervently for me and and and prayed
[2:04:59] along the lines of what had been on my
[2:05:00] heart that you know the devil's been
[2:05:01] beating me down and I needed to to rise
[2:05:04] up and and do battle and just praying
[2:05:06] that I would give the strength to do
[2:05:08] that and uh so after he was done praying
[2:05:12] my pastor was in the line he said Nathan
[2:05:13] that was the word of the Lord to you if
[2:05:15] you'll take it and uh I appreciate him
[2:05:18] saying that because carnally you might
[2:05:20] have said well I talked to brother Matt
[2:05:21] this morning he knew exactly what to
[2:05:22] pray for me but it was the spirit of God
[2:05:25] it wasn't a man praying uh so in my
[2:05:28] heart it was it was something that I
[2:05:30] took very sincerely and I meditated on
[2:05:32] after the service and I think I'm past
[2:05:33] happy birthday uh
[2:05:37] so Sunday morning uh brother Timothy
[2:05:40] puit was was preaching along the lines
[2:05:43] of brother Andrew Spencer the night
[2:05:45] before that hey our Victory is in the
[2:05:47] word of God and I I you know I I'm kind
[2:05:50] of got to I've got a nervous spirit that
[2:05:53] I've had to battle in my life and many
[2:05:55] times what Nathan was talking about in
[2:05:56] the youth service I feel this pressure
[2:05:58] like man I got to go do backflips or
[2:06:00] something to get something out of this
[2:06:02] service or go get prayed for and when he
[2:06:03] was talking and and preaching about
[2:06:05] getting Victory from the word I was
[2:06:08] thinking about a spirit that i' had been
[2:06:09] dealing with that had been influencing
[2:06:10] my life and I thought well maybe I had
[2:06:12] to go up and get prayed for and then
[2:06:14] something in my heart just said you know
[2:06:17] what he said that he came to set at
[2:06:20] Liberty those that are bound am and I
[2:06:23] said I'm just going to take that right
[2:06:24] here in my
[2:06:25] seat and since then it's been it's been
[2:06:28] Victory because I took it by the word so
[2:06:32] I thank the Lord
[2:06:33] I he used those services to put a grit
[2:06:36] in my heart and now I just keep telling
[2:06:38] the devil the truth and smacking him
[2:06:41] again and smacking him again and I'm
[2:06:43] seeing the Victory and and I'll just
[2:06:45] throw in a bonus here it was Wednesday
[2:06:46] night and we were having our testimony
[2:06:48] service and and at the end of the
[2:06:49] service the Lord was just moving and and
[2:06:52] there was something in my heart that was
[2:06:53] Heavy still was like there's still
[2:06:55] something the Lord wants to do in my
[2:06:56] heart and uh and so I just I started
[2:06:59] praying and I was like man I feel like I
[2:07:01] just need to break loose and and so I
[2:07:03] started praying and I said Lord I
[2:07:05] believe you got something for me and
[2:07:07] rather than procrastinate I said Lord
[2:07:08] I'm going to get it tonight and that was
[2:07:11] and I just started praying that and all
[2:07:13] of a sudden I was dancing down the
[2:07:14] center
[2:07:15] aisle and uh and it that burden was just
[2:07:18] off it was like the Lord was just
[2:07:20] calling me to a just a a fresh Birth
[2:07:23] really a fresh baptism in the Holy Ghost
[2:07:26] and uh so that was a nice little bonus
[2:07:28] so I'm just thankful for the Lord he's
[2:07:29] my deliver my healer and I'm so free by
[2:07:33] his grace and by his
[2:07:43] word praise God praise God anyone
[2:07:47] else brother Chris
[2:07:56] since it's not just for youth right
[2:07:58] praise the Lord so um I just really
[2:08:01] appreciated what brother Andrew had said
[2:08:02] about um just uh tonight in that service
[2:08:07] would be you would go deeper in the Holy
[2:08:09] Ghost than you've ever experienced
[2:08:11] before and right along the lines of what
[2:08:13] brother Nathan ER was saying when Kier
[2:08:15] and I got to the front of the prayer
[2:08:16] line there I just um and I'm not one to
[2:08:19] do this and I'm ashamed I should be but
[2:08:21] I just put that word in my mouth and I
[2:08:23] was like Lord that word is for me and my
[2:08:26] family that word is for me and tonight
[2:08:29] we're going to go deeper in the Holy
[2:08:30] Ghost than we've ever been that's for me
[2:08:33] that's for my wife and I was just you
[2:08:34] know putting that word in my mouth like
[2:08:36] that's for us and God really came down
[2:08:39] in a special way and blessed us and in
[2:08:41] ways that he hasn't ever done before and
[2:08:43] and we're deeper in the Lord than we've
[2:08:45] ever been and and um I've battled for a
[2:08:48] long time with just an inferiority
[2:08:50] complex feeling not good enough like you
[2:08:53] know and feeling like you know like no
[2:08:55] one loves me or no one cares and
[2:08:57] honestly it goes deeper than the whole
[2:08:58] like woe is me you know it's when the
[2:09:00] devil's on your shoulder making you feel
[2:09:01] like no one loves you and you know
[2:09:04] better but the devil's there you know
[2:09:07] and um I went through the prayer line
[2:09:08] and and brother
[2:09:10] Wayne Uh said God deliver him from all
[2:09:13] those complexes and help him know that
[2:09:15] we love him and he has a family here and
[2:09:19] that was just so powerful for me and I'm
[2:09:20] so thank
[2:09:29] amen I know I'm not youth either but um
[2:09:33] Saturday I was excuse me I was sitting
[2:09:37] there
[2:09:38] praying and I have been Belling my
[2:09:40] husband's been gone two and a half years
[2:09:43] almost and I didn't know of his family
[2:09:45] still loved me or cared about
[2:09:48] me I was B on it for a long time and I
[2:09:51] was laying sitting there praying and I
[2:09:53] said Lord I don't know why the devil's
[2:09:54] hitting me so hard tonight so I looked
[2:09:57] over and I saw my nephew brother Brian
[2:10:01] hyrin and I said the devil said he
[2:10:03] doesn't love you I said well we're going
[2:10:05] to see about that devil so I went over
[2:10:07] to him and I I said Brian I love you and
[2:10:10] he says andany I love you too and I
[2:10:13] always
[2:10:14] will so that was a prayer
[2:10:17] answered amen
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:27] amen some people are
[2:10:30] pointing sister
[2:10:37] [Music]
[2:10:42] Zoe I actually have two uh when I didn't
[2:10:46] share at our church last night but I
[2:10:48] didn't realize until after camp that it
[2:10:50] had happened um before Camp I had really
[2:10:53] lost my joy and peace that I hadn't had
[2:10:57] probably since I was a teenager and
[2:10:59] after Camp I realized that both of those
[2:11:01] had been restored to me and I'm so
[2:11:03] grateful for
[2:11:06] [Applause]
[2:11:12] that and uh since it's probably going to
[2:11:15] be finishing up the testimonies this is
[2:11:17] appropriate this is actually from the
[2:11:19] Afterparty um we had planned to feed 500
[2:11:22] people and about halfway through the day
[2:11:24] we realized we did not have enough food
[2:11:27] um so I prayed specifically that it
[2:11:29] would multiply enough that we could feed
[2:11:31] everybody but not that we would be
[2:11:32] eating it for 3 months and uh we had 2
[2:11:36] lbs of meat left over after feeding
[2:11:38] about 650
[2:11:40] [Music]
[2:11:41] people Glory
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:50] Glory well 3 years ago uh at the first
[2:11:54] true word Camp I went through the prayer
[2:11:56] line and I tore my achilles in the
[2:11:59] prayer line in half and I got out of the
[2:12:03] prayer line extremely
[2:12:05] confused so the Lord had spoke to me and
[2:12:08] said one of your legs is shorter than
[2:12:10] the other and from then on I went
[2:12:15] through surgery recovery all these
[2:12:17] different things I had hip problems
[2:12:20] forever I had sciatica after that I
[2:12:23] didn't have any problems so fast forward
[2:12:27] to this year uh I didn't go through the
[2:12:29] prayer line however I was up praying
[2:12:32] with sister Jennifer Crossman and just
[2:12:35] praying over her and uh I stopped
[2:12:39] praying just listening to the music and
[2:12:41] I thought about you know if I went
[2:12:44] through the prayer line I would ask for
[2:12:46] a deeper walk with the Lord and sister
[2:12:50] Jennifer
[2:12:51] she snaps her head up and looks at me
[2:12:53] and she says what would you go for the
[2:12:56] prayer line
[2:12:57] for so I completely collaps over her
[2:13:02] because the power of God just fell on my
[2:13:04] seat and I hadn't danced in 13 years I
[2:13:09] hadn't dance especially because my
[2:13:12] achilles had tore in half three years
[2:13:15] ago and well Saturday night I danced
[2:13:18] before the Lord

[2:17:41] God you remember when you get the
[2:17:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost what did
[2:17:46] Brother Brenham said eternal life
[2:17:49] was living for us others so now you got
[2:17:53] the power to live for others not just
[2:17:56] for
[2:17:57] yourself but you live to give your life
[2:18:01] for someone else I know it's getting
[2:18:04] late I just take a couple minutes here
[2:18:06] quickly three years ago when Nathan came
[2:18:09] actually in the back office he said
[2:18:12] Grandpa you think we could have a youth
[2:18:15] camp and uh I don't remember how what I
[2:18:18] said immediately but if I didn't think
[2:18:21] about it then I didn't think about it
[2:18:24] how much help it's going to be
[2:18:26] needed to have a camp and that's what
[2:18:30] I'm so proud of I know brother Wayne is
[2:18:32] not here tonight but I'm so proud of a
[2:18:36] church like
[2:18:37] this that got right behind the vision
[2:18:41] brother Ronnie sister
[2:18:44] police Nathan you're not complete
[2:18:47] without your
[2:18:49] wife and I say
[2:18:51] thank you everybody that caught the
[2:18:54] vision for the kingdom of God and I say
[2:18:58] praise His wonderful name I
[2:19:00] appreciate I appreciate the love in the
[2:19:03] camp and you know it was just everybody
[2:19:06] just it was for God's
[2:19:09] glory and uh I don't know I I think
[2:19:12] maybe some people just didn't want to
[2:19:14] give a testimony but you know me as a
[2:19:18] grandpa uh when I I saw Gabriel and the
[2:19:22] different ones go through and from the
[2:19:24] church and
[2:19:26] others and and I just couldn't help but
[2:19:28] go pray for Gabriel I don't know what
[2:19:30] the Lord did for him but I don't even
[2:19:32] know but all of a sudden I felt another
[2:19:35] hand laying on my shoulder here was the
[2:19:38] other
[2:19:40] grandpa brother
[2:19:42] Aiden and I tell you what people we put
[2:19:45] our hearts together in the love of
[2:19:47] Christ for the kingdom of God
[2:19:52] and I'll tell you what on the other side
[2:19:55] you'll see all the results all the
[2:19:58] results let's pray together one more
[2:20:01] testimony that I was given to me
[2:20:04] yesterday by Brother Tom
[2:20:07] sprouls
[2:20:09] Jasmine I don't know how old she is very
[2:20:11] little but on Sunday she got desperate
[2:20:16] to receive the Holy
[2:20:17] Ghost and the Holy Ghost did fill her
