[4:24] this evening we thank you
[4:27] for doing something a little out of the
[4:29] ordinary
[4:30] Mar that
[4:32] sometimes what God requires of us is
[4:35] just to do something that we we don't
[4:37] normally do and that's how he
[4:41] moves there's not a congregation I'd
[4:43] rather be speaking to tonight I love
[4:46] each of you with all my heart and
[4:48] there's no man of God I'd rather be
[4:49] speaking with
[4:50] than my
[4:52] buddies amen
[4:59] see if we can get through
[5:02] this I love thee oh Lord my strength the
[5:05] Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my
[5:07] deliverer my God my strength in whom I
[5:10] will trust my Buckler and the Horn of my
[5:13] salvation in my high tower I will call
[5:15] upon the Lord who is worthy to be
[5:17] praised so shall I be saved from mine
[5:20] enemies the Sorrows of death Compass me
[5:22] in the floods of ungodly Med made me
[5:24] afraid the Sorrows of Hell compassed me
[5:26] about the snares of death prevented me
[5:29] in my distress I called upon the Lord
[5:32] and Cried unto my God he heard my voice
[5:35] out of his Temple and My Cry came before
[5:38] him even into his ears then the Earth
[5:40] Shook and trembled the foundations also
[5:42] of the hills moved and were shaken
[5:44] because he was wroth and there went up a
[5:47] smoke out of his nostrils and a fire out
[5:49] of his mouth devoured coals were kindled
[5:51] by it he bowed the heavens also and came
[5:53] down and darkness was under his feet and
[5:56] he rode upon a cherub and he did fly yet
[5:58] he did fly upon the wings of the wind he
[6:01] made Darkness his secret place his
[6:03] Pavilion round about him were dark
[6:05] Waters and thick clouds of the skies at
[6:08] the brightness that was before him his
[6:10] thick clouds passed hailstones and coals
[6:13] of fire the Lord also thundered in the
[6:16] heavens and the highest gave his
[6:18] voice hailstones and coals of fire yay
[6:21] he sent out his arrows and Scattered
[6:23] them and he shot out Lightnings and
[6:24] discomfited them then the channels of
[6:27] the waters were seen and the the
[6:29] foundations of the world were discovered
[6:31] at thy rebuke oh Lord at the blast of
[6:34] the breath of thy nostrils and he sent
[6:36] from above he took me he drew me out of
[6:38] many Waters how many can say Amen to
[6:41] that he delivered me from my strong
[6:43] enemy and from them which hated me for
[6:46] they were too strong for me they
[6:48] prevented me in the day of my Calamity
[6:50] but the Lord was my stay he brought me
[6:53] forth also into a large place he
[6:55] delivered me because he delighted in me
[6:57] the Lord rewarded me according to my
[6:59] righteousness according to the CLE the
[7:01] cleanness of my hands hath he
[7:03] recompensed me for I have kept the ways
[7:05] of the Lord and have not wickedly
[7:07] departed from my God for all his
[7:08] judgments were before me and I did put
[7:11] away his statutes from me I was also
[7:13] upright before him and I kept myself in
[7:15] my iniquity therefore hath the Lord
[7:18] recompensed me according to my
[7:19] righteousness according to the cleanness
[7:21] of my hands in his eyesight with the
[7:23] merciful thou will show thyself merciful
[7:26] with an upright man thou will show
[7:28] thyself upright and with the pure thou
[7:31] Wil show thyself pure with the frower
[7:34] thou will show thyself frower for thou
[7:36] will save The Afflicted
[7:38] people but will bring down high looks
[7:41] for thou will light my candle the Lord
[7:44] my God will Enlighten my darkness for by
[7:47] Thee I have run through a troop and by
[7:50] my God have I leaped over a
[7:53] wall as for God his way is perfect the
[7:57] word of the Lord is tried he is a
[8:00] buckler to all those that trust in him
[8:02] for who is God save the Lord or who is a
[8:05] rock Save Our God it is God that girth
[8:08] me with strength and maketh my way
[8:11] perfect may God bless his word you may
[8:12] be seated
[8:15] tonight I just like to speak for a uh uh
[8:18] just a moment tonight on on breaking
[8:20] into the believer's
[8:22] position I believe we heard a direct
[8:24] word from the Lord that my brother made
[8:26] it in his family God bless you
[8:29] I believe we heard a direct word from
[8:31] the
[8:31] Lord last night on a direction on a
[8:35] direction of what God has in store for
[8:37] his people and is not to stay where we
[8:39] are but it's to come out a spirit of an
[8:42] exodus is to come out and and not only
[8:44] to just come out but also to go into so
[8:47] it's not enough just to step out into
[8:49] something he didn't just call us out of
[8:51] denominations to leave us where we were
[8:53] or to send us back to where we came from
[8:55] but he called us out of where we came
[8:57] from to take us to somewhere we've never
[8:59] been so you got to come out of something
[9:01] to go into something new and you got to
[9:02] leave something old behind to come into
[9:04] something new that God has in store for
[9:06] you he didn't just call you out of where
[9:08] you were to bring you in his church pew
[9:11] just to live a simple life just to be a
[9:13] regular believer just to just to
[9:15] sometimes enter into the glories but he
[9:16] called you out of the Meer of
[9:19] denomination that you can manifest The
[9:21] Works of his presence in this age I
[9:23] believe the direction was very clear
[9:25] last night and it was perfectly in line
[9:27] God bless you brother Isaac for what a a
[9:29] surrendered vessel I don't believe we
[9:31] were looking at a we're not looking at a
[9:32] rookie preacher here and I I don't say
[9:34] this to compliment the man but this is
[9:36] what the message does if you surrender
[9:38] yourself to the message this is what it
[9:41] produces it produces a man that will lay
[9:43] himself aside and will surrender to the
[9:46] anointing of God and only the message
[9:48] can produce that God doesn't come by
[9:50] just a nomination of fod but he comes by
[9:53] his word and his word alone and you can
[9:56] mimic a lot of things you can mimic
[9:58] emotion and you you can mimic uh you
[10:00] know a lot of different environments but
[10:03] you can't mimic when the angel of the
[10:04] Lord comes by CU everything's different
[10:07] when he comes by and I believe there
[10:08] were some witnesses here last night not
[10:10] just our pastor but I believe it was
[10:12] even in the congregation that witnessed
[10:13] the angel of the Lord last night moving
[10:15] and we don't lean to that but it sure is
[10:17] good to know he's in the camp it sure is
[10:19] good to know that he's amongst his
[10:20] people and he's not just here just to
[10:22] make a show but he's here to do a work
[10:25] in our lives he didn't just call us
[10:27] where we came from to leave us here but
[10:29] but he's got something in store for us
[10:30] and I believe that with the direction of
[10:33] the message in this hour we have a clear
[10:35] path of where we are going in this age
[10:38] we are not to stay in Leo DEA we are not
[10:40] to be lukewarm we are not to just uh uh
[10:43] deal with the situations that we've been
[10:45] given but Revelations 4:1 says and I
[10:47] looked and I was called up higher
[10:50] there's another door to enter into but
[10:52] we've got to take that step to enter
[10:54] into it now God broke open a way for
[10:56] them to come out of Egypt right but they
[10:59] had to take that first step into the Red
[11:01] Sea they had to take God at his word now
[11:04] he had delivered them out of Egypt and
[11:05] there was a Red Sea in front of them but
[11:07] they had to take God at his word where
[11:09] they would take the first step into
[11:11] those into those Waters they had to take
[11:13] a step and I believe that's where we're
[11:14] at tonight I believe we're taking a step
[11:16] into the land that God has has brought
[11:19] us to and said pursue the
[11:21] enemy take the land for it is a good
[11:25] land now you notice in the scripture
[11:26] that that every time God's people are
[11:28] persec Ed God comes on the
[11:31] scene every time there's a persecution
[11:34] you know Satan is is if I could just say
[11:37] it you know we we don't we don't let our
[11:39] kids use this word but I'm going to say
[11:40] he's stupid because he continues to
[11:43] persecute the people of God and he has
[11:46] not learned his lesson yet that every
[11:48] time God's people are persecuted God
[11:50] comes down on the scene every time that
[11:53] the people of God are up against a wall
[11:55] God breaks down walls and you see Satan
[11:58] would love to have us walled in with our
[11:59] own ideas or what we're allowed to do or
[12:01] what we're not allowed to do or what
[12:03] we're allowed to believe or not allowed
[12:04] to believe and you see every time we get
[12:06] backed up against the wall God comes and
[12:09] breaks the wall I like what brother
[12:10] Isaac said last night we're not chickens
[12:12] fenced in by walls but we're Eagles that
[12:15] fly over walls we can leap over walls we
[12:18] can run through troops we can do
[12:20] whatever the word says we can do and
[12:22] it's unlimited what we can do when we
[12:24] surrender ourselves to the anointing of
[12:26] this age we are not just we are not just
[12:28] believing some kind of denomination or
[12:31] some man's idea but this is a Vindicated
[12:33] message that will never be replicated it
[12:36] will never be reproduced it will never
[12:38] be mimicked but this is God's word and
[12:41] God's word is
[12:42] pure now now God will not just take any
[12:45] sacrifice into himself but he has to
[12:47] have a pure sacrifice the pure let the
[12:50] pure be pure right you know I think
[12:52] about it like this brother is was
[12:53] preaching on the fire last night and uh
[12:55] there at work a few weeks ago uh we were
[12:59] burning some trash from a job and and
[13:02] and uh and and somebody was throwing I
[13:05] won't mention names but somebody was
[13:06] throwing uh uh everything in the fire
[13:09] you know well it'll burn it'll burn you
[13:10] know and well the fire department came
[13:12] by sorry brother Jordan but the fire
[13:14] department came by and they just put out
[13:16] our fire they just open up a hose and
[13:19] just so I get a call from the fire
[13:22] marshal and he says you know hey you
[13:23] guys you're burning this fire over there
[13:25] and that could be uh you know we're
[13:26] going to get uh the uh EP PA involved
[13:29] and you guys are polluting the Earth and
[13:32] said well what can we burn he said pure
[13:36] wood say so as long as we put pure word
[13:38] on there we're good yeah well I thought
[13:41] about that last night I said there's
[13:43] only one fire that God accepts you he
[13:45] will not accept denominational fire or
[13:47] trash wood fire but he only accepts pure
[13:50] wood he only accepts a pure sacrifice he
[13:53] will not come down and bless just any
[13:55] fire he didn't come down and just bless
[13:57] any old fire but our God is a consuming
[14:00] fire to those who will approach the pure
[14:02] word with pureness of heart not with an
[14:05] idea of what they think it will be but
[14:07] let God be God and he'll come down and
[14:09] consume the fire I I thank God that he
[14:11] didn't send us into this age to break
[14:13] into something and not give us something
[14:15] to do it with but I would ask us tonight
[14:18] what is that in your hand I know it's a
[14:20] simple question but what is it tonight
[14:21] in your
[14:22] hand think about it every time in the
[14:25] scripture that a persecution was made
[14:27] God provided something a utens a tool a
[14:29] way out for those people to escape he
[14:32] didn't just leave them there but he sent
[14:34] something to them he sent a staff to
[14:37] Moses right what did he hold over the
[14:39] Red Sea it was his staff where did he
[14:41] get that staff well God gave it to him
[14:42] you could we could go down the list
[14:43] where did David get the
[14:47] sling where did shamgar get the ox
[14:50] go where did Samson find that jawone but
[14:54] you see God didn't just send us to an
[14:55] agent and say okay you're Overcomers but
[14:57] he gave us everything we need to
[15:00] overcome in this age we're not waiting
[15:02] for something to come I'm not waiting
[15:04] for another theology or another idea or
[15:07] another lecture on what the message can
[15:08] do but I believe the authority of the
[15:10] message has arrived I believe that we're
[15:13] in the age of adoption where we are have
[15:15] the authority of the word to speak and
[15:18] it shall obey us for who are we anyway
[15:21] but the adopted Sons and Daughters of
[15:23] God speaking his word and if he moved a
[15:26] mountain the same old sling will move it
[15:28] again tonight we just have to put the
[15:30] same word in our mouth of Faith every
[15:33] time God gives us a way out but every
[15:35] time persecution comes God will also
[15:38] come and I know there's some needs that
[15:40] have been on the hearts of the people
[15:41] and every time persecution comes God
[15:44] will also
[15:45] come well it hasn't broke yet God will
[15:48] also come well we're still up against
[15:50] the wall he'll also come every time that
[15:53] we're persecuted we can count on one
[15:55] thing God will show up he never leaves
[15:58] us he never forsakes us amen every time
[16:01] people are persecuted now think about
[16:03] this every time Steven was
[16:07] persecuted there was a Saul right right
[16:10] where did God show up yeah well they
[16:12] thought well Stephen was taken home God
[16:14] didn't show up in
[16:17] time but look at God's
[16:19] plan he would show up to the one that
[16:21] was persecuting them and he would come
[16:24] with the light out of the out of the out
[16:26] of out of the skies and turn Saul into
[16:28] Paul that's right so every time the
[16:30] people of God are persecuted God shows
[16:32] up on the scene he changes the situation
[16:35] so I thank God tonight that we're not
[16:37] empty-handed we're not empty-handed but
[16:39] he sent something to us in this age he
[16:42] sent a way for for us to break out of
[16:45] this situation he says this in the
[16:47] rising of the sun because I live you
[16:48] live also and I live in you and the
[16:50] works that I do the works that I do
[16:52] identify myself in you what a message no
[16:55] wonder we've had dark world of theology
[16:57] but in the evening time there shall come
[16:59] light again there will be a resurrection
[17:01] in the evening time it shall be light at
[17:03] the evening time now the very essence of
[17:06] the message that was sent that he has
[17:07] risen from the dead we his
[17:11] beneficiaries we say we we his
[17:14] benificiaries we who share the
[17:17] resurrection with him draw benefits from
[17:20] this by proving to the world that He Is
[17:23] Alive we cannot do it by word only
[17:27] amen we cannot do it by some tradition
[17:29] of man that's right we only reflect
[17:32] exactly what we're pointing to I'm
[17:35] afraid today that too many of us are not
[17:36] getting the people to Christ or can I
[17:38] say the message we're getting them to a
[17:40] church or to a theory but we must get
[17:43] them to the message he is the only one
[17:45] he's the only one that has life and he
[17:48] that has the son has life so he that has
[17:52] the message has life and I I don't want
[17:55] to go to another theory or a man's idea
[17:58] I've had enough of those days but I want
[18:00] the message and the message alone
[18:02] because that's what's going to set us
[18:03] free that's what's going to identify Us
[18:05] in this age can I say that's what's in
[18:07] your hand that's right this is not just
[18:09] some idea but what is that in your hand
[18:11] it's the message of the king you have
[18:14] the scepter of the king in your hand
[18:16] you're not wondering if it's the truth
[18:18] but it's been established and Vindicated
[18:19] that's the truth and I say it's time to
[18:21] take what's in your hand and go to the
[18:24] enemy and get back what he took from you
[18:27] [Applause]
[18:28] we could just we won't read it for time
[18:30] but you know it when when when David
[18:31] found himself coming into his C his camp
[18:34] and there was things that were taken
[18:35] from him
[18:37] yeah did he sing the wowy Woos maybe for
[18:40] a minute but what did he do yeah did he
[18:44] go try to seek someone
[18:46] somewhere no did he try to call the pope
[18:49] sir come
[18:50] on no did he need to wait for so and so
[18:53] to come back in the country no he
[18:56] encouraged himself in the Lord can I say
[19:00] he encouraged himself in the word he
[19:03] took what God gave him and he encouraged
[19:05] himself and he recognized who he was
[19:08] what he had been given and that his
[19:10] possessions had been taken from him and
[19:12] David didn't have anything more than he
[19:14] had when he walked into that camp but he
[19:16] had a different perspective of who he
[19:18] was and you may not have anything
[19:19] different tonight than when you walked
[19:21] in here but you can leave with a
[19:23] different perspective of who you are and
[19:25] the authority that you've been given you
[19:27] don't have to take what the devil gives
[19:29] you but you can take what God has given
[19:31] you in your hand and March to the
[19:33] enemy's camp and take back what the
[19:35] enemy has stolen from
[19:37] you maybe he's stolen your health take

[23:02] his word but he sent benefits with it
[23:05] and he sent beneficiaries to receive of
[23:08] the benefits is that simple enough
[23:10] you're the beneficiary receiving from
[23:12] the benefits that God sent Psalms 103
[23:14] would say bless the Lord oh my soul and

[23:49] takes care he takes care of your of I'm
[23:52] not
[23:53] worthy because none of us are worthy
[23:56] David knew that better than anybody I'm
[23:59] not worthy to receive the benefits of
[24:01] God but it's not about how worthy you
[24:03] are it's about how worthy he is and
[24:05] David said he's the one who forgiveth
[24:08] all of thine iniquities every single one
[24:13] oh my hallah so the the devil doesn't
[24:15] have a hold on us there and then he says

[24:30] diseases but he says all thy diseases so
[24:33] that takes care of the spiritual world

[25:10] [Applause]
[25:12] eagles
[25:14] hallelujah what a type what a type for
[25:17] us cuz I I don't know about you friends
[25:19] but I know if you've been walking this
[25:20] way a little bit you've been down in the
[25:21] dumps as an eagle you've been down low
[25:24] sometimes and you forgot that you're an
[25:25] eagle and you get down there and you get
[25:27] the wo is me and you get to discouraged
[25:29] and you forget that you once were up in
[25:30] the heavenlies and all of a sudden a man
[25:33] of God will come and create an anointing
[25:35] and you'll get under that anointing and
[25:36] you'll remember that you can fly and you
[25:39] know if you just if you just stay on
[25:40] that Revival though you'll find yourself
[25:42] back down in the valley but you know you
[25:45] can have your own Revival as an eagle
[25:47] you know that you can have your own
[25:49] anointing as an eagle and when an eagle
[25:51] and an eagle get together they just
[25:53] climb higher and higher and higher and
[25:56] higher why because it's what they're
[25:58] born to do they were not born to stay
[26:00] down amongst
[26:02] walls they were born to fly and when you
[26:05] get around that you know how it is when
[26:06] you get around a real good believer and
[26:07] it begins to energize something in you
[26:10] it begins to make you remember who you
[26:11] are anyway why are you here
[26:15] anyway well I'm a so and so or I'm a I'm
[26:17] a mechanic or I'm a barber I'm
[26:21] a that's not why you're here come on
[26:25] you're here to manifest The Works of
[26:27] Jesus Christ you're here to make
[26:29] Manifest this word you know why we
[26:31] believe this a lot of religions have
[26:33] books a lot of religions read books sure
[26:37] they have qurans and they have I'm sure
[26:38] Buddha has a book or whoever has a book
[26:40] and there's a lot of churches that have
[26:42] this book are the prophet of God say I'm
[26:44] not interested in reading a book right
[26:47] I'm interested in manifesting a book I'm
[26:50] interested in manifesting the promises
[26:52] of God and we're not just looking to
[26:53] argue quotes back and forth of who is
[26:55] right about this or who is right about
[26:57] that that doesn't make two sense to God
[26:59] what God wants is he wants a Believer
[27:01] surrender to his word that will come
[27:03] under the anointing of the hour and will
[27:05] make manifest the
[27:07] promises you want to please God make
[27:10] manifest one of his
[27:13] promises you want God to bless you say
[27:15] God make make manifest in my
[27:17] life he's not a man that he should lie
[27:20] but he is truth and his promises are yay
[27:23] and amen he's just looking for somebody
[27:26] who say I'm a promise of God I'll make
[27:29] manifest that promise but how could that
[27:32] promise of healing come L somebody were
[27:34] sick how could that promise of
[27:36] Deliverance come L somebody were
[27:38] depressed how could that promise of
[27:40] Salvation come L somebody were lost you
[27:43] see but we are Promises of God who said

[29:28] Woos and arise to the glory that God has
[29:30] called us to we were not made to be down

[29:35] made to arise Like an Eagle we were made
[29:39] to arise up out of our condition we were
[29:41] made to arise up above the turmoil of
[29:44] the world we were made to arise above

[30:07] to rise above the
[30:10] world oh it gets us down but we're
[30:12] called to rise you think an eagle is
[30:15] just a type to be a type it's who you
[30:16] are you were called to Flap a little
[30:19] higher than where you're at right
[30:21] now you may think well I've reached the
[30:23] peak well bless God I have not I know I
[30:26] can be higher than where I'm right now I
[30:29] know that I can reach Greater Heights
[30:30] than I've achieved I know there's a
[30:32] greater faith for me that's just beyond
[30:34] the veil if I can tear down the veil of
[30:37] partition between me and my
[30:39] promise you see but this anointing
[30:41] breaks the veil this anointing tears
[30:44] down the veil and it's not just some
[30:46] sword that tears it down it's the Sword
[30:48] of Fire brother say it's the fiery sword
[30:50] of God that ripped that veil of the day
[30:52] on Calvary and there was The Mercy Seat
[30:55] in plain view God in plain view when the
[30:58] veil was R let me say tonight church
[31:00] this is God in plain
[31:02] view where are these promises they're
[31:05] right here amongst
[31:06] us where are the deliverances of God
[31:09] right here amongst
[31:11] us this is God in plain view you see
[31:14] well you're mighy or yourself no I know
[31:15] how how puny I am I know how big God is
[31:19] and God is so great and so big that he
[31:20] can come to me and make me one of his
[31:23] promises despite what I feel like look
[31:26] like my mistakes he can manifest his
[31:29] word in
[31:31] me that's how big my God
[31:33] [Applause]
[31:35] is that's our commission this age to
[31:38] make
[31:40] manifest looks unseen to the world but
[31:43] to those that have a trained
[31:46] eyej he says I want to ask you something
[31:48] upon this message now of looking at the
[31:50] Unseen if the Unseen will declare
[31:52] himself himself
[31:56] visible then to make your soul pass
[31:59] every barrier that's right yeah if the
[32:02] Unseen
[32:04] one will make himself visible here to
[32:07] you because he promised he would do it
[32:10] thank if the Unseen one comes I believe
[32:14] he he
[32:15] [Music]
[32:16] came for God so loved the world that he
[32:21] gave
[32:23] himself I'm getting a little ahead of
[32:25] myself but there's some things that God
[32:27] can't send someone to
[32:30] do he's got to go himself for God so
[32:33] loved the world that he gave his only
[32:36] begotten son and the word became flesh
[32:39] and it dwelt among them so it was God in
[32:41] plain view once again it was God walking
[32:43] in flesh once again and where we had one
[32:46] that came to full maturity and then he
[32:48] he he went his way I must decrease so
[32:50] that you can increase the word had been
[32:52] deposited right right now you can't kill
[32:56] what's already been deposited the seeds
[32:58] already been
[33:01] placed it already been planted they
[33:03] could chase down every every disciple
[33:05] they could chase down every Apostle but
[33:07] they couldn't kill the seed that Christ
[33:09] had already planted they can they can
[33:11] just try to destroy the message they can
[33:14] try to tear it down they can try to tell
[33:16] you it's not true but you cannot destroy
[33:18] the seed that's already been
[33:20] [Applause]
[33:22] planted I don't believe the message lost
[33:24] any power in in in on December the 24th
[33:27] 196 5 but I believe the seed had been
[33:30] planted and God said all right the
[33:31] seed's there it's time for you the SE to
[33:34] come
[33:36] home you can't stop it it's already been
[33:39] in motion you cannot remove the life
[33:42] that God has planted there and what God
[33:44] has joined together no man can put us
[33:46] under because God put it together before
[33:49] the foundation of the world how the
[33:51] angel came to me how'd the angel come to
[33:53] you it was God Almighty in his grace and
[33:56] mercy
[33:58] [Applause]
[33:59] you think well my parents they they knew
[34:01] the message how'd they get
[34:05] it brother Josh how'd he come to you
[34:08] how'd the angel come to you you weren't
[34:10] looking for him but God knew your name
[34:12] before the foundation of the world and
[34:14] he sent a message to you he said I'll
[34:17] come to you right so you didn't do
[34:20] anything to earn this so then it's not
[34:22] based on your Merit it's not based on
[34:24] your worthiness right but it's God
[34:27] putting a plan in motion and there's
[34:30] nothing the devil can do to stop it but
[34:32] you see there requires something in our
[34:33] part that we have to fight through the
[34:36] Leo toan atmosphere that's on this
[34:39] age I don't know about you friends but I
[34:41] refuse to sit down and be called
[34:47] lukewarm I refuse to be spewed out of
[34:49] God's mouth it'd be better that I was
[34:52] never born than to be spewed out of
[34:53] God's mouth but I don't believe he
[34:54] called me this age to just be lukewarm
[34:58] stsy just hope something happens but I
[35:01] believe he called me to this age to be a
[35:02] manifested work of his promised word to
[35:05] us that we will overcome this age we
[35:09] will take another step out of leoda we
[35:12] are in it but we are not of it we are
[35:14] amongst it but we're not of it we are a
[35:16] bride called to a bride Age We Are
[35:19] eagles called to an eagle age we are
[35:21] Overcomers called to the age of the
[35:25] Overcomer we are we are a third pole
[35:28] manifestation called to the age of the
[35:30] third
[35:31] pole I love preaching at home cuz I
[35:33] don't have to worry I don't have to say
[35:34] is this okay is that all right cuz I
[35:36] know it is cuz I'm preaching to
[35:42] Believers
[35:48] hallelujah what do you think God wants
[35:50] from us in this
[35:51] age what do you think his desire is oh
[35:54] the King has a desire he has a desire
[35:56] from this age
[35:58] is to come out of her be not partakers
[36:00] of her what is it what was it that
[36:04] Christ hungered for on the cross I
[36:08] thirst he wants pure
[36:12] water what do that mean to us he wants
[36:15] pure
[36:16] worship he doesn't want man-made worship
[36:19] he wants pure worship and I believe God
[36:22] has called some people to the Earth in
[36:24] this age that will give him what he
[36:26] desires in this age is not going to
[36:28] receive vinegar at the cross there's a
[36:29] lot of denominations out there that
[36:31] think they're giving God water tonight
[36:33] but they're giving him vinegar one more
[36:35] time but I believe we're from a church a
[36:37] generation a time and an age and a
[36:39] dispensation that will not give him
[36:41] vinegar but we will give him the pure
[36:43] water of Bethlehem we will give him the
[36:45] pure water of Praise because we have
[36:47] been called in position here that he
[36:49] might be glorified in my
[36:52] lives what is my purpose here if it's
[36:54] not to praise God is it just to look
[36:57] like the world them blend in and
[36:58] occasionally witness to somebody or this
[37:00] no my purpose here is to be the
[37:02] manifested word in this hour that's why
[37:05] we're called here that's the anointing
[37:07] that we feel in this age that's why the
[37:09] message
[37:12] came God does not care what minister is
[37:15] right about what quote God never sent
[37:17] his word God never sent a man in 1909
[37:21] and kept him from of sin kept him from
[37:24] cigarettes kept him from alcohol so that
[37:26] you and I can argue about what the seven
[37:28] seal
[37:29] is God did not take the time to
[37:31] vindicate a prophet like no other
[37:34] Prophet before so that we can argue
[37:36] about water
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:38] baptism so that we can argue about what
[37:41] the third pole is or it's for the bride
[37:42] or it's not for the bride it's in the
[37:44] message and if we would bow to the
[37:47] message we wouldn't bow to
[37:49] denominational ideas but there's only
[37:51] one person that deserves my
[37:56] praise it was it wasn't Billy Graham it
[37:58] wasn't or Roberts it wasn't brother
[38:00] brand it was God and God Almighty and I
[38:03] have been called and positioned here
[38:05] that I might give him
[38:10] praise hey there's a lot of rocks in
[38:12] this
[38:13] country I ain't letting one of them take
[38:15] my place I'm not going to let one of
[38:18] them move into my
[38:19] position because if I withhold
[38:21] somebody's going to take that spot but
[38:24] I've been called in position here to
[38:26] give him all my
[38:27] [Applause]
[38:30] that's why we're here he deserves it
[38:32] doesn't
[38:34] he oh my Fanatics oh yeah they'll call
[38:37] us Fanatics since when do we care what a
[38:41] bunch of uncircumcised unsaved
[38:43] Philistines care about
[38:45] us are we children of God or are we not
[38:49] are we called to a purpose or are we not
[38:52] since when do we care brother Justin
[38:53] what the world says about us but we are
[38:56] called to a higher place than they will
[38:58] ever even dream of who cares what
[39:01] anybody else thinks I care about what
[39:03] the word says about me and what I'm to
[39:06] do in this age and it says to give him
[39:17] praise I believe he's longing for it I
[39:20] believe he's desires for it right I
[39:22] believe he thirst for

[39:50] about
[39:52] God what about the one who's sitting on
[39:54] the throne tonight have we stopped and
[39:56] asked ourselves what can I do for
[39:59] you what can I do for the greatest of
[40:01] the greatest our champion the one who
[40:03] came to where we were and changed our
[40:05] situation who brought the Living Water
[40:07] to us what can we do for him and he has
[40:10] a request to us brother Carrie no matter
[40:12] what that request was we would do it no
[40:14] matter what it cost no matter what it
[40:16] called for we would give him what he has
[40:19] asked for and he has been thirsty in
[40:21] this
[40:22] age he's been fed a lot of
[40:25] denominational sacrifices thinking
[40:26] they're pring him but he's asking for a
[40:29] pure sacrifice he's asking for somebody
[40:32] who will Step Beyond the ideas of a man
[40:34] and will move into the holy of holies
[40:37] where it was a sin to move into the
[40:38] inner chamber now it's death if you
[40:41] don't move into the inner chamber you
[40:42] got to get into where the shikina glory
[40:44] is you've got to get into the believer's
[40:47] the believer's
[40:49] position that's our inheriting rights we
[40:51] were never made to be on the
[40:53] outside that's why you hate your life
[40:55] when you're just living a Leo toan way
[40:57] yeah that's why you can't get no
[40:59] satisfaction you have to drag yourself
[41:01] to church sometimes cuz you're living in
[41:03] the middle of Leo DEA when you were
[41:04] never called to be there you were never
[41:06] called to be a lukewarm or starchy or
[41:07] wishiwashi or or just a make believer
[41:10] you were called to be a genuine believer
[41:12] living in the holy of holies where the
[41:14] Shak of Glory Reigns that's where you
[41:17] were called to be that's who you are
[41:20] that's your position in Christ that's
[41:22] the dispensation of the word in this
[41:25] age no I won't be quiet because this is
[41:28] why I'm
[41:29] here that we might declare the works of
[41:32] God in this AG to say he is mighty I'm
[41:35] unworthy but he is
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:40] mighty oh my friends we're we're we're
[41:42] we're breaking into the
[41:45] age amen a seed's been planted but it
[41:49] doesn't stay in seed
[41:50] form right it was never the intention of
[41:54] of of the Prophet to leave us in seed
[41:56] form it was never the intention of
[41:58] Christ when he preached to his disciples
[42:00] to stay in SE form but it was to
[42:04] grow yes sir
[42:08] brother hallu wouldn't you do whatever
[42:10] it
[42:11] took
[42:13] amen well I've got to think a little bit
[42:15] differently okay my thinking never
[42:19] helped me out at
[42:20] all my thinking's never been the right
[42:22] way brother
[42:24] Chris it just hasn't I think sometimes
[42:26] this is the right way to do it no it
[42:29] ain't that's an easy one for me to
[42:33] surrender
[42:35] that's CU I already know I'm a doofus
[42:37] when it comes to
[42:40] thinking brother Bram said you don't got
[42:41] to think
[42:44] coming you gave it
[42:46] up you gave up your thought about it you
[42:49] gave up your idea about
[42:50] it you really think God needs our
[42:52] thought and our tweak on this oh yeah
[42:56] brother
[42:58] oh if you could get the Revelation that
[43:00] I'm
[43:03] getting yeah you
[43:05] know that brother Isaac he's just you
[43:07] know he I saw him do that double stomp
[43:09] last night and he's just
[43:13] immature if he had the real revelation
[43:16] of the
[43:18] hour it's in that still Small Voice
[43:22] where was the still Small Voice it came
[43:24] out of the fire so you can't apply that
[43:26] script RT unless there's a fire there
[43:29] that a still Small Voice could speak
[43:31] from I Believe In the Still Small Voice
[43:33] it spoke to me just a moment ago I
[43:35] believe in it but it has to come out of
[43:37] a fire and if there's no fire for it to
[43:39] come out of then I wouldn't trust the
[43:40] voice because only one thing can speak
[43:42] out of a fire and it's God and God Alone
[43:44] look where Moses met him and it was at
[43:46] the fire right look where Paul met him
[43:48] it was at the fire right there has to be
[43:50] a fire for that voice to come out there
[43:52] has to be something there that God can
[43:55] manifest himself through that his voice
[43:57] can come out and speak to
[43:59] you I believe that we should get away in
[44:01] secret in prayer and I I don't know why
[44:03] we're at home we're at
[44:07] home come on the still Small Voice has
[44:10] led me to where I'm at today but it came
[44:12] from the fire of God it came out of the
[44:15] fire of the word and it spoke to me and
[44:17] told me where I am and where I'm
[44:20] going I believe in that but I believe
[44:23] there's got to be a fire behind it to
[44:24] vindicate it AR you can't just throw
[44:27] that scripture and that quote and that
[44:28] scripture you got to have it all
[44:31] together we've got to come under this
[44:34] word or we're going to go the way of
[44:40] man I believe I believe
[44:43] we're there's some people going through
[44:45] some
[44:46] battles you might come to church and I
[44:48] appreciate the love that brother Ben let
[44:50] us let out we shake one another's hand
[44:52] man man it's good to see you it's good
[44:54] to see you you don't know it but that
[44:56] brother you're shaking a hand hand he
[44:57] could be going through a tremendous
[44:59] battle you put your your hug around him
[45:01] there could be a battle going on there
[45:03] you know why cuz we're all Warriors you
[45:06] may feel like you're not you might just
[45:07] be a mama somewhere but you're a
[45:09] warrior you're not in this age by chance
[45:12] right you're not in this age cuz it's a
[45:14] picnic but God made you a warrior in
[45:16] this age and I believe if he made you a
[45:18] warrior then he gave you a
[45:20] [Music]
[45:22] sword I believe you got a weapon in your
[45:24] hand tonight I believe the sword of the
[45:26] king came down to the prophet as an
[45:28] example of what the word can do in the
[45:30] hand of a Believer but I don't believe
[45:31] that that sword just stopped at the
[45:33] prophet but I believe that sword also
[45:35] fits us I believe if you reach your hand
[45:37] up in faith tonight and take the message
[45:39] for what it is you'll say it fits it
[45:42] fits my hand it fits me this is what
[45:45] I've been called for it fits this is who
[45:48] I am this is the sword of the king this
[45:51] is not a king sword this is the king
[45:54] sword this is not a message this is the
[45:57] message and it fits my
[46:00] hand it fits well now what did God send
[46:03] it for he sent it to go to war against
[46:05] the enemy of course God can defeat Satan
[46:09] anytime anywhere under any condition but
[46:12] he wants you to do it he wants you to
[46:14] take him at his word and defeat Satan
[46:17] everywhere that he's attacking
[46:20] you I believe I'm talking to some Mighty
[46:22] Men tonight oh
[46:24] yes you've been through some battles but
[46:27] let's go through one more together all
[46:28] right all right let's just put ourselves
[46:31] in the place of three men who went in
[46:33] battle because their King was thirsty
[46:35] and there David was after the battle he
[46:37] said I thirst but I don't just thirst
[46:39] for any water I want water from The Well
[46:42] of Bethlehem I want water from home I
[46:45] want water that'll satisfy this thirst
[46:48] within me you know what those men do

[46:53] Command we will fight we will rage if we
[46:56] die so be in but we will bring you water

[47:10] the king to go to battle and take
[47:14] back to bring praise

[48:38] never tasted of cutting down a
[48:39] denominational Spirit we just take it

[48:48] got the wrong guy tonight I've been giv
[48:50] the king sword and I know what to do
[48:53] with it and when the bride recognizes
[48:55] what she is and how he wants the word
[49:00] handled come
[49:02] on I think the devil's getting Mighty
[49:04] uncomfortable by
[49:06] now not anything I'm doing but you're
[49:08] recognizing something you're recognizing
[49:11] that you're not just here living a
[49:12] simple life just cuz but you've been
[49:14] given the authority greater than any age
[49:17] before you has been given to the people
[49:19] of God Like
[49:23] Us say oh Lord let this cup pass no I
[49:26] don't want this this cup to pass let

[49:35] hard we've got to fulfill it right we've
[49:39] got to take the king of his word we've
[49:42] got to march on but he's provided the
[49:45] sword that we'll do it with that's he's
[49:47] provided everything around us that we
[49:49] need right this is not just a
[49:53] a on this is not just a temporary
[49:56] Revival
[49:58] under I'm at home he gave me liberty so
[50:00] I'm going to go ahead and handle this
[50:03] yeah you've seen false revivals before
[50:06] yes you've seen revivals built on false
[50:08] doctrines and on men and on kingdoms and
[50:10] on certain Ministries you've seen those
[50:12] revivals come and those revivals go and
[50:13] it's put a scarecrow in front of you
[50:15] that you're afraid to enter into this
[50:17] revival because you're afraid that it's
[50:19] another false Revival but this is the
[50:21] bride's Revival and it will not cease
[50:24] because this revival is not based on
[50:26] brother Wayne or Brother Ray or true
[50:28] word Tabernacle this revival is on the
[50:31] word this revival is what the king's
[50:34] message declared to this age it will not
[50:38] cease until the rapturing of the church
[50:41] this revival doesn't exhaust but this
[50:43] revival moves from meeting to meeting to
[50:45] home to home from Heart to Heart to
[50:50] Heart this is not my Revival this is the
[50:53] bride's Revival this is the King's
[50:55] Revival this is not man-made work

[51:06] you think well you're a fanatic well I'm
[51:08] a fanatic whatever I do I guess but what
[51:10] he's doing micaah is he's building a
[51:12] fire in your life that you could throw
[51:15] the works of the enemy in the
[51:18] fire what was Paul doing when he was
[51:20] trapped on the island he was gathering
[51:23] sticks right that's right to stoke the
[51:26] fire
[51:28] oh you're just twitching the scripture
[51:29] does it say that or does it
[51:31] not he was gathering sticks to build a
[51:34] fire and while he was building a fire
[51:36] for God he was attacked by the enemy and
[51:39] you know what he did he threw it in the
[51:41] fire that he was building and you might
[51:43] be attacked tonight by a lot of
[51:44] different spirits of indifference but I
[51:46] say throw it in the fire that God's
[51:48] Building amongst us and let that snake

[52:50] fire
[52:51] amen hallelujah can I get real simple
[52:54] for a minute three Hebrew children yeah
[52:57] yeah they would not bow down right to
[53:01] what a man-made image they would not bow
[53:04] down to a man-made image of what they
[53:07] were told you'll bow or you'll
[53:09] die you don't know it maybe but you've
[53:11] been told the same thing tonight you'll
[53:13] bow or you'll
[53:17] die every time God's children are
[53:19] persecuted he comes on the scene right
[53:22] BR says this in the super sa one time
[53:24] they had three of them down in Babylon
[53:26] in that big old city there and they was
[53:28] built a super City they had a a
[53:31] supernatural and they throw them in a
[53:32] super fire head seven times hotter than
[53:35] it ever was head and there was a
[53:37] supernatural sign of a supernatural God
[53:39] standing in the fire supernaturally
[53:42] saving them did you count how many times
[53:43] I said
[53:44] Supernatural and what did they do they
[53:47] possess the gates of the
[53:51] Furnace what are you going to name it
[53:52] [Applause]
[53:54] tonight maybe it's not a furnace to you
[53:56] maybe your furnace is out at home and
[53:58] it's really Ren me tonight but I doubt
[53:59] that I believe your furnace has the name
[54:01] of
[54:02] depression I believe your furnace has
[54:04] the name of anxiety I believe your
[54:06] furnace has the name of uh of
[54:09] uncertainty of where you're going of
[54:11] confusion of the age but I believe it's
[54:13] time to face the furnace
[54:15] tonight
[54:17] amen amen their enemy he says watch how
[54:21] God I don't know how much this quote I
[54:22] read but it's so good I wish you would
[54:24] take the time to read it it's out of uh
[54:26] it's out out of uh I'm looking for it
[54:27] not my hairline show us the father and
[54:29] his
[54:33] suffices God himself coming
[54:37] down there's a lot of there's a lot of
[54:39] things that God will send somebody to
[54:41] take care
[54:42] of but there's some things he's got to
[54:45] come
[54:48] himself there's some
[54:50] situations that he holds back the angels
[54:53] and he comes down himself says one day
[54:56] there were some people down there
[54:57] trusting God's word down in Babylon
[54:59] let's just watch this for a few moments
[55:00] am I
[55:01] okay oh I could see a great thing
[55:03] happening there had been an issue made
[55:04] and that nobody would down there begin
[55:06] to worship any other God or didn't bow
[55:08] down to what the government said or
[55:09] would have to be thrown into a fiery
[55:11] furnace and there was three boys there
[55:13] Shadrach Meshach and abedo they decided
[55:15] they was not going to bow down to any
[55:18] image they were going to serve the true
[55:20] God they believed his word notice they
[55:22] found out that these boys they wouldn't
[55:23] bow down so they had the furnace uh uh
[55:26] uh according to the king's Commandments
[55:27] seven times hotter than it ever was had
[55:29] if there's a type that does not need
[55:31] explaining this is us we'll burn that
[55:34] religion out of him that's quote we
[55:38] can't you can't burn the holy ghost out
[55:40] of a
[55:42] man well this fire is getting too hot
[55:44] you can't burn the holy ghost out of a
[55:46] man well it's a little too radical to me
[55:49] you can't burn the holy ghost out of a
[55:51] man you can turn this fire up seven
[55:54] times but you cannot kill a Holy Ghost
[55:57] filled man because he was birthed in the
[56:00] fire he was birth in a fire to start
[56:03] with and that's where he's at
[56:06] home he can't kill it because that's
[56:09] where it comes from it's the Holy Ghost
[56:12] and Fire and
[56:13] [Applause]
[56:16] it's why it's fire itself you can't burn
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:23] it there's too much too much man came
[56:26] here at the temple the other day and
[56:27] place and said well brother started to

[56:44] Greece couldn't burn
[56:47] him these Hebrew children believing
[56:50] God's word they say God is able to
[56:51] Deliver Us from the fiery furnace but
[56:52] nevertheless we're not bowing down to
[56:54] your image oh if we could just get some
[56:57] Shad rcks in the building
[57:00] tonight that's where you come in friend
[57:02] that's where you come in brother John

[59:46] Believers doesn't it he says let's turn
[59:48] our attention to
[59:51] Heaven A believer's
[59:54] perception there may it may appear to be
[59:56] more of them than there is of us but if
[59:58] we turn our attention to heaven and we
[1:00:01] begin to take the scales off our eyes
[1:00:03] and we begin to look through a
[1:00:04] supernatural lens we begin to see the
[1:00:06] heavenly vision of where we're standing
[1:00:08] and I just look at this scene brother BR
[1:00:10] dramatized it so I'm going to do it the
[1:00:12] same and and and and there they are in

[1:01:46] going to do with those Believers down
[1:01:47] there in that last age when the devil's
[1:01:49] Waring against him and he's putting
[1:01:51] cancer on their minds cancer in their
[1:01:53] bodies he's putting he's putting
[1:01:54] depression like he never has anxiety
[1:01:57] pressure like he never has he's
[1:01:58] attacking the church at every front
[1:02:00] Financial issues disparity issues all
[1:02:03] just just hurt feelings everywhere what
[1:02:05] are you going to
[1:02:06] do stand by Michael yes sir stand by
[1:02:10] Gabriel stand by this job I'm coming
[1:02:14] down to handle
[1:02:17] myself this job I'm going to manifest
[1:02:20] myself again that I will come down to
[1:02:23] their situation and where they're at
[1:02:26] and the prophet of God says he gathered
[1:02:28] the wind from the East and the west and
[1:02:31] the North and the South and he gathered
[1:02:33] all of the Winds of the Earth with him
[1:02:35] and he came down to that
[1:02:37] furnace oh you don't think God likes the
[1:02:39] fire well he faned himself Jacob he
[1:02:41] faned
[1:02:43] himself on he controls the
[1:02:49] winds don't lose patience when the
[1:02:51] Revival seems to be a little low he
[1:02:53] controls the winds he decides the
[1:02:56] seasons he decides when it's high and
[1:02:59] when it's low and sometimes we go
[1:03:00] through a low season but I feel the
[1:03:02] abundance of rain I feel the change in
[1:03:05] the wind I feel the wind stirring from
[1:03:07] the East and the west and the North and
[1:03:09] the South I believe he's gathered
[1:03:11] together The Winds of the
[1:03:13] earth you might be that southern wind
[1:03:15] brother Carrie I might be that western
[1:03:18] wind but he's gathered together the
[1:03:20] winds to come together for a purpose
[1:03:23] he's gathered us together to come
[1:03:24] together that we might St stoke the
[1:03:33] fire I see another one we know the story
[1:03:36] I see another one in there why is there
[1:03:41] four well I thought it was just
[1:03:43] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:03:45] the Holy Ghost why is there
[1:03:47] four because when these three come and
[1:03:49] United under the word the fourth one
[1:03:53] comes I see one like under the son of
[1:03:56] man and he's in the midst of the fire
[1:03:58] how did King Nebuchadnezzar know what
[1:04:00] the son of man look like but it had to
[1:04:01] have been a revelation to him that that
[1:04:04] being standing in that fire is not just
[1:04:06] a man but there's something about that
[1:04:09] being standing there that is greater
[1:04:11] than any man could do he is pushing back
[1:04:14] the Flames of Leia he is pushing back
[1:04:17] the Flames that would keep you in
[1:04:19] disparity he is pushing back sickness in
[1:04:22] your body he's pushing back yeah
[1:04:25] he's pushing back cold lukewarmness he's
[1:04:28] pushing it back I say Let the Fire Burn
[1:04:32] Let the Fire consume every every enemy
[1:04:36] tonight because there's a fourth one
[1:04:38] with us manifested sons of God are not
[1:04:41] afraid to enter into every blessing that
[1:04:43] God's given
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:46] them believe that's that's who you are
[1:04:48] tonight I believe that's who you are I
[1:04:50] believe death can't stop you brother
