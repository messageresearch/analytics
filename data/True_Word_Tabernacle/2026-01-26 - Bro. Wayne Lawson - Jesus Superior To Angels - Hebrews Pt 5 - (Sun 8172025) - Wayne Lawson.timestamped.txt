[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. just to be able to speak that name
[7:42] today and to know that it is a great
[7:45] privilege of ours. Amen. To be given
[7:47] that kind of name that we could speak it
[7:49] and know the power of it. Amen. Amen. We
[7:52] sure uh certainly appreciate each of you
[7:54] today. And and just before we go into
[7:56] the word of the Lord, maybe we just bow
[7:58] our hearts with a word of prayer and
[8:00] let's just speak to him today. Amen.
[8:02] Father, we are so honored to be in your
[8:05] house today to come together as your
[8:08] children. Lord, we love you and we thank
[8:11] you for the great and grand opportunity
[8:13] to serve you
[8:16] before this congregation and before all
[8:18] that would hear this. Lord, we humble
[8:21] ourselves to you and to your grace
[8:23] that's been in our lives. Truly, Lord,
[8:27] we are unworthy of you. And Lord,
[8:29] there's nothing good of any man. But
[8:33] Lord, by your grace and your mercy, we
[8:35] could stand here today as your son. And
[8:39] we ask you for all that grace and mercy,
[8:42] Lord, to be dispensed through your
[8:44] gospel this morning to every need to
[8:47] your children today. Lord, as we exalt
[8:49] the name of our Lord Jesus, we ask you
[8:52] that you would give the grace and the
[8:54] anointing. Lord, I pray this morning
[8:57] that Lord, every spirit unlike you that
[9:00] Lord, may it be bound this morning
[9:03] &gt;&gt; by the power of your word and Lord, may
[9:06] there be an anointing loosed in this
[9:08] building that Lord, even the angels of
[9:11] God would feel the freedom to come here
[9:14] among us this morning and help us as we
[9:16] lift up your holy name, Lord. that it
[9:18] would be lifted to the place that every
[9:20] man could look up and see a hope and a
[9:23] and an ability. Lord, now we ask that
[9:26] this morning, Father, that you would
[9:28] send this kind of grace as we ask these
[9:30] things in the mighty name of Jesus
[9:32] Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. And God
[9:36] bless you. If you have your Bibles
[9:38] today, uh we'd like to go into the word
[9:40] of the Lord. I'm going to be speaking to
[9:41] you again out of the book of Hebrews,
[9:43] the first chapter. Uh, I want to uh read
[9:47] Hebrews chapter 1. And I want to go uh
[9:50] into the fourth verse this morning. Uh,
[9:53] Hebrews 1 and verse 4. And I'm going to
[9:56] read down to the 14th verse. Um, if
[9:59] you're studying the book of Hebrews that
[10:01] uh, Brother Brand preached a series on
[10:03] the book of Hebrews and he doesn't spend
[10:05] much time in the latter parts of this
[10:08] uh, particular verse. He or chapter he
[10:10] changes to chapter 2 pretty quickly out
[10:13] of this. But I just want to take a few
[10:15] minutes uh in this and maybe a couple
[10:17] more services in the Hebrews chapter 1.
[10:20] And I want to read here from the fourth
[10:21] verse. And being made so much better
[10:25] than the angels,
[10:27] as he hath by inheritance
[10:29] obtained a more excellent name than
[10:31] they. For unto which of the angels
[10:36] said he at any time, thou art my son,
[10:40] this day I begotten thee. And again, I
[10:43] will be to him a father, and he shall be
[10:46] to me a son. And again, when he bringeth
[10:50] in the first begotten of the world, he
[10:52] saith, and let all the angels of God
[10:54] worship him. And of the angels he saith,
[10:58] who maketh his angel spirits, and his
[11:00] ministers a flame of fire? But unto the
[11:04] Son he saith, "Thy throne, oh God, is
[11:07] forever and ever a scepter of
[11:09] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[11:11] kingdom. For thou loveth righteousness
[11:13] and hated iniquity, therefore God, even
[11:15] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil
[11:19] of gladness above thy fellows. And thou,
[11:22] Lord, in the beginning has laid the
[11:24] foundation of the earth, and the heavens
[11:26] are the work of thine hands." My
[11:28] goodness, wasn't Paul a writer? And they
[11:32] shall perish, but thou remainest, and
[11:35] they shall all wax old as doth a
[11:37] garment, and as a vesture, thou shalt
[11:39] fold them up. He's speaking of creative
[11:41] things, the universe itself. And they
[11:43] shall be changed, but thou art the same,
[11:46] and thy years shall not fail. But to
[11:50] which of the angels, he said, at any
[11:52] time, sit, on my right hand, until I
[11:54] make thine enemies thy foottools? Are
[11:57] they not all ministering spirits sent
[11:59] forth to minister to them who shall be
[12:02] the heir of salvation? May God bless his
[12:04] word as you could be seated this
[12:06] morning.
[12:08] Uh, of course, uh, Paul uh, this this
[12:13] writer um, brother Bram tells us that he
[12:15] is the writer, but then he also tells us
[12:18] that what's writing is the creative
[12:20] being inside of Paul. Uh, because now
[12:22] we're hearing it from the sun. This is
[12:24] the revelation of it. And uh I I think
[12:27] these um this chapter one is amazing
[12:30] because Paul has done something in the
[12:32] first couple verses in that he he has
[12:35] told you that Jesus is superior to all
[12:37] prophets. And he's telling you he's not
[12:40] just a prophet, but he's the God of the
[12:42] prophets. And then when he comes to this
[12:45] point, then he's now going to start
[12:47] comparing him to angels. And uh I I I
[12:51] think it's powerful myself because uh uh
[12:53] Paul I was just me and brother Ray was
[12:55] just talking about this. I think it was
[12:57] amazing myself uh that you know wouldn't
[12:59] it have been something to sit in one of
[13:01] Apostle Paul's services. Wouldn't it
[13:03] wouldn't it have been something to sit
[13:04] in the service and hear Paul bringing
[13:07] the Old Testament. Amen. And the
[13:10] revelation that he had caught of Jesus
[13:12] Christ and detailing that to the
[13:14] congregation. You know uh I'm I'm I'm a
[13:17] reader. So I sit and read the book of
[13:19] Hebrews and I read the first chapter of
[13:21] Hebrews and moved to tears, you know,
[13:22] sometimes move to uh such a such a just
[13:25] such an energy moves in you. Just
[13:27] reading what Paul said just puts
[13:29] something in you makes you want to just
[13:30] scream out loud when you're even all by
[13:32] yourself. And I thought my what just to
[13:35] read this letter would have been
[13:36] something to have sat in the presence
[13:38] and heard this spoken uh in such a way.
[13:41] And and and you know I I I think of the
[13:44] of of what he had saw that he was so
[13:47] pushing to the people is these were Jews
[13:50] and Paul was trying to tell them, Amen,
[13:53] that this Jesus that this Jesus himself
[13:56] has is has been exalted that he is the
[14:00] appointed heir. And I I love how the
[14:02] first two verses he said God in sunry
[14:04] times and diverse manners spake unto the
[14:06] fathers by the prophets but hath in the
[14:08] last days spoken unto us by his son. And
[14:11] we've we've exhausted that pretty
[14:12] heavily. But watch this next part of
[14:14] this. For whom he hath appointed heir of
[14:18] all things by whom also he made the
[14:21] world. And and and brother Brandham
[14:23] picks this up in Hebrews chapter 1 and
[14:25] speaking of Jesus and he said, "He has
[14:27] been appointed the heir of all things."
[14:30] Amen. And and I I I think it's very
[14:32] powerful because this appointment of
[14:35] course is speaking of that he has
[14:37] inherited all things. Now, if you study
[14:39] the message years ago, I was on
[14:41] dispensations at a Bible conference and
[14:43] I I was studying the son of God, the son
[14:45] of David, the son of man. But it was in
[14:47] that study that I really picked up the
[14:49] son of Abraham as well. And you'll see
[14:51] that he comes under different names. And
[14:53] brother Bam tells us when Jesus is the
[14:55] son of David, he's heir to the throne of
[14:58] David. And and there's a Davidic
[15:00] covenant. And when he's the son of
[15:02] Abraham, of course, he was the son of
[15:04] Abraham, then he is heir uh uh to the to
[15:07] the grant according to the actual earth
[15:10] because that was the promise given unto
[15:12] Abraham. But then as the son of man, he
[15:15] was heir to the natural things. But then
[15:17] as the son of God, brother Bram said
[15:19] that means he was heir to everything. So
[15:22] it wasn't nothing that he was not heir
[15:24] to as the son of God. And so this
[15:27] morning we we recognize that that
[15:30] appointment that was given to Jesus
[15:32] started all the way back in the
[15:34] messianic prophecies of Genesis chapter
[15:36] 1. Sometimes people think the Abrahamic
[15:38] covenant began in Genesis 12, but
[15:40] honestly it began in Genesis 3 when the
[15:43] seed was appointed uh uh to defeat the
[15:46] serpent seed when God came in Genesis 3
[15:48] and 15 and he tells them he says, "And
[15:51] the woman's seed shall bruise the head
[15:53] of the serpent." He appointed a seed
[15:56] that was going to defeat. See, that's
[15:58] when it that's when it come into
[15:59] contact. As brother Bram said, what
[16:01] happened was when God's children got in
[16:02] trouble in Eden, he said it was love
[16:06] that funneled down and made a way. It
[16:08] was God himself came and made a covenant
[16:11] with love that would make a way for them
[16:13] to return. Amen. So, it was under under
[16:15] that covenant. He was an appointed seed.
[16:17] He was the appointed heir of all things.
[16:19] Brother Bam makes these connections in
[16:21] Hebrews chapter 1 part uh in paragraph
[16:24] 106 and 107 and he says that Jesus was
[16:27] the appointed seed and the appointed
[16:29] heir. He's showing the same thing the
[16:31] appointed heir and appointed seed from
[16:33] the from the garden of of Eden. And he
[16:35] said that's what constantly that Satan
[16:38] had watched for was for that seed to
[16:41] come forth. So that's when Abel was
[16:43] born. That's why Cain slew Abel because
[16:46] he was trying to stop the appointed heir
[16:48] of all things. Satan was doing his best
[16:50] to stop it. When he killed Cain, killed
[16:53] Abel, he was trying to stop it. But
[16:54] brother Bam then goes on to say, he
[16:57] said, "But see then God caused Eve to
[17:00] bring forth Seth, which spoke of the
[17:02] resurrection of that seed." So in other
[17:04] words, you can do what you want to do to
[17:06] kill it, but you're not going to kill it
[17:07] because God's going to raise it up
[17:09] again. So he was showing that this was
[17:11] going to be an unstoppable heir. If this
[17:13] this seed would be an unstoppable seed
[17:16] and we can see it all the way through
[17:18] the Old Testament. You can see how in
[17:20] the message Joseph meeting his brethren,
[17:22] brother Bam says when he met his
[17:24] brethren in the field and they hated
[17:26] him. He said they did it without a
[17:28] cause. It was because of that seed
[17:30] promise that Satan was always after that
[17:33] seed. They tried to kill Joseph. BUT
[17:36] REALLY, IT WASN'T just Joseph they was
[17:38] after, was it? Because Joseph was going
[17:41] to be the thing that would cause the
[17:43] entire land or the seed life of Israel
[17:47] to remain. If you would have killed
[17:49] Joseph, look at what would have
[17:50] happened. But Joseph was the one that
[17:53] went down to Egypt and he didn't just
[17:55] save Israel, he basically saved all of
[17:58] humanity in that famine. Amen. To show
[18:01] that you will never stop that seed. It's
[18:03] a unstoppable seed. it it's all the way
[18:06] up through the scriptures. You can see
[18:08] it when when you look in the scripture,
[18:09] you see that right in the middle of
[18:11] Joseph, they're trying to stop it.
[18:13] That's when Tamar shows up and and Tamar
[18:16] then plays a part of a harlot and
[18:17] accepts the seed of Judah. And then
[18:19] Judah is going to burn his own seed
[18:22] because he don't understand. But it's
[18:25] when she reveals the seed that's in me
[18:27] is the seed of Judah and it's for the
[18:30] posterity of Judah. And when that seed
[18:32] is revealed, that's when the revelation
[18:34] comes. We can't take her life because of
[18:36] the seed that's on the inside of her.
[18:38] Amen. WHY COULDN'T GOD TAKE SARAH'S
[18:41] LIFE? Because she was going to bring
[18:42] forth that same seed. Oh my goodness. If
[18:45] God could protect the natural course
[18:48] that was going to bring that seed. What
[18:50] about the spiritual seed that he
[18:52] promised to bring forth? When I look at
[18:54] this, I find it's amazing. That's
[18:56] exactly what happens in Esther.
[18:58] Remember, Amen. the Esther, she's hid
[19:01] because non is trying to destroy all the
[19:04] Jews. He's trying to kill that seed. But
[19:06] it's not until that last seal is broken
[19:09] open. When in the presence of the enemy
[19:12] and the presence of the king, it is
[19:14] revealed that Esther is the seed of that
[19:16] Jew. And when THAT'S REVEALED, WATCH
[19:18] WHAT HAPPENS. IT GIVES HER liberty to
[19:21] KNOW THAT SHE'S OF THAT SEED. I'll tell
[19:23] you, amen. If you ever discover, Amen.
[19:26] that you're of the same seed that was
[19:28] that appointed seed back in the garden.
[19:30] You'll find out that the devil couldn't
[19:32] stop it. Amen. When it was in when it
[19:35] was in Abel, when it was in Seth, he
[19:37] couldn't stop that seed line. When it
[19:39] was David, he couldn't stop it. WHEN IT
[19:41] WAS JOSHUA, he couldn't stop it. WHEN IT
[19:42] WAS MOSES, AMEN. THEN WHAT MAKES YOU
[19:45] THINK THIS morning that he's going to
[19:47] stop this supernatural seed of Abraham?
[19:50] FOR THERE'S A PROMISE OVER YOUR LIFE
[19:52] THAT YOU SHALL POSSESS the gates of your
[19:54] enemy. AND THERE IS NO WEAPON. LOOK AT
[19:57] THAT. THERE IS NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST
[19:59] YOU THAT CAN PROSPER. AMEN. BECAUSE GOD
[20:02] has made promises concerning this seed.
[20:06] You are the appointed seed. I'll say
[20:08] this. If you Amen. are the the appointed
[20:11] seed of God. You are Abraham's seed.
[20:13] You're Gentiles, right?
[20:15] &gt;&gt; So if you're going to be the seed of God
[20:17] this morning, you have to be seed
[20:19] through Abraham, which is Abrahamic
[20:22] seed, which is by promise. Uh if you're
[20:24] uh if you uh like to study your Bible,
[20:27] the book of Romans, the 8th chapter said
[20:28] that we're heirs with Jesus Christ.
[20:31] We're heir of God, but it's with Jesus
[20:34] Christ and we are joint hes and we are
[20:36] heir to every promise. That's why when
[20:39] Jesus spoke to the fig tree and and it
[20:41] withered and the next day he said, "If
[20:43] you would have faith in God, then you
[20:46] could say unto this mountain." because
[20:48] he was showing that what he was
[20:50] exercising in the earth was being done
[20:53] as an heir of God. So any believer would
[20:56] have an airship to the same promises and
[20:59] the same authority THAT HE WAS SHOWING
[21:01] on the earth because he was doing it to
[21:04] show the promises made to the seed of
[21:07] Adam. When I I look back at this and see
[21:09] that you're an heir to every promise, a
[21:11] joint heir to every promise, you know,
[21:14] to be an heir is different than earning
[21:16] something, right? Amen. It matters the
[21:18] family you're born in. If you're born
[21:20] into a poor family, sorry, uh you're
[21:22] just going to be uh you're going to get
[21:23] an inheritance, but it might not be
[21:25] much. But if you're born into a more
[21:27] wealthy inheritance, then you're born
[21:29] into that. They call it being born with
[21:31] a silver spoon in the mouth, you know.
[21:33] Amen. But you you you recognize as you
[21:36] are born as a child of God that you're
[21:39] born as an heir of everything because
[21:43] you are a son of God. Amen. Then you're
[21:46] an heir. Now, you might say this
[21:47] morning, well, brother Wayne, I've got a
[21:49] lot of fear and there's a lot of things
[21:50] happening and I'm afraid and I don't
[21:52] know if I'm really worthy of these
[21:53] things. But, Brother Brandham says it
[21:55] like this, "What are you scared about?
[21:57] Are you afraid to take his word?" Now,
[21:59] don't be afraid and call the thing
[22:02] right. I'm an heir to this. Now, I do
[22:05] not DESERVE THIS. I KNOW I don't deserve
[22:08] this, but I'm an heir anyhow. Do you
[22:11] see? Because I'm an heir, I receive it.
[22:13] There it is. Because I'm an heir. I'm an
[22:16] heir of salvation. I'm an heir of the
[22:19] Holy Spirit. I'm an heir because Jesus
[22:21] paid the price. I didn't have to do
[22:24] nothing. I just fell HEIR TO IT. AMEN.
[22:27] AMEN. I'll tell you this. Amen. If
[22:28] you've been born again, you're an heir
[22:30] this morning. And it's not what you're
[22:33] earning. It's what you have inherited
[22:35] because of the seed THAT YOU ARE. AMEN.
[22:38] I KNOW WHO YOUR earthly daddy or mama
[22:40] might be important to this natural life,
[22:42] but in the spiritual sense, if you're a
[22:45] son or daughter of God, YOU ARE HEIR TO
[22:48] EVERYTHING THAT GOD HAS as being a child
[22:51] of God.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; My when I think about this, sometimes
[22:54] you get under certain spirits and and
[22:56] those spirits don't want you to see what
[22:58] belongs to you. But, you know, I I think
[23:00] it's time that you come out from under
[23:03] any unbelief. Hallelujah.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; I think this is THE TIME THAT GOD IS
[23:08] SEPARATING his children from all
[23:10] unbelief. I I believe this. Brother
[23:13] Brham said, "Separating from the evil
[23:14] one, the one on the outside, see, taste,
[23:16] feel, smell, hear." Amen. We got to get
[23:19] beyond the human that we might be able
[23:21] to see the divine promises that have
[23:23] been made to you. Not in your humanity,
[23:26] but in your heirship OF THE SEED OF
[23:29] ABRAHAM. Oh my. They your your father
[23:32] Abraham had a had a season. And he
[23:34] didn't see all of his promises because
[23:36] brother Bam said when God called him, he
[23:38] took Lot with him. Remember? Amen. And
[23:40] and the Bible tells us in Genesis 13
[23:43] after that Abraham separated from Lot,
[23:46] it was then that Melkazedc appears to
[23:49] him and tells him to look north, south,
[23:51] east, and west. And whatever you see
[23:54] belongs to you. Do you see until if
[23:57] you're under something or someone that
[24:00] has got you thinking that something
[24:01] don't belong because I'm not worthy of
[24:03] it and I could never obtain this and I
[24:05] can never do you see then that's a veil
[24:07] of unbelief that's keeps you from THE
[24:10] PROMISES THAT GOD HAS MADE TO YOU. It's
[24:12] a little bit like a seed being in the
[24:14] shock. Amen. And under the shuck of
[24:17] Pentecost, you were you were kept away
[24:19] from all of the divine promises that God
[24:22] made under this generation. BUT WHEN YOU
[24:24] MADE A SEPARATION, you come out into a
[24:26] land and if you're looking east or
[24:28] you're looking north or you're looking
[24:30] south, if you're looking up, whichever
[24:32] way you look, IT ALL BELONGS TO YOU.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, I I don't know how you're
[24:38] looking this morning, but I say YOU
[24:39] OUGHT TO LOOK PAST THE veil of unbelief
[24:42] and say, "It belongs to me. Healing
[24:44] belongs to me. SALVATION BELONGS to me."
[24:47] AMEN. JOY BELONGS to me. Life belongs to
[24:51] me. It's mine because I'm an heir. So,
[24:53] brother Wayne, what did you do to earn
[24:55] it? Nothing.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; And I didn't do anything to earn it. You
[24:59] can't do anything to earn it because it
[25:01] all belongs to you. And after your
[25:04] separation, you can look up and see that
[25:06] every promise is unto you because God
[25:09] has gave that promise. In Galatians
[25:10] 3:16, it says the promises were made
[25:13] unto as seeds as of many, but as of one
[25:16] to that seed which is Christ. These
[25:18] promises were made in Romans 8 and32. He
[25:21] said he delivered him up and how shall
[25:23] not with him freely give us all things.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus freely gave us all things. That's
[25:31] a lot of things, isn't it?
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham preaches the pardon out of
[25:34] that scripture and he said, "If you give
[25:36] us all things, he can give us a pardon,
[25:38] too." My goodness, isn't that amazing?
[25:41] Amen. In 2 Corinthians 6 and:e 10, you
[25:44] may feel like Paul, sorrowful yet
[25:46] rejoicing. poor yet making many rich as
[25:50] having nothing yet I possess all things.
[25:53] I tell you, you might not have a mansion
[25:55] or a fancy car, but if you're a child of
[25:57] God, you possess all things. THAT'S WHY
[26:00] JESUS wouldn't bow to the devil to take
[26:03] the world when he was on the earth
[26:05] because HE KNEW IT WOULD FALL HEIR TO IT
[26:07] ANYHOW. And I say this this morning, I
[26:10] all them rich folks out there on the
[26:12] coast of North Carolina and down Florida
[26:14] and them big ma fancy places, Mara Lago
[26:16] and all of them. I tell you this, you
[26:18] can have them right now. Amen. But when
[26:20] the millennium comes, we going to own it
[26:22] all. Amen.
[26:24] When the millennium comes, we got THE
[26:26] BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE. You them
[26:28] northern ROCKIES UP ALONG CANADA, YOU
[26:30] CAN HAVE THAT CABIN UP ON the top of the
[26:32] hill if you want to. Amen. Come looking
[26:34] for me. You'll hear it. Amazing grace,
[26:36] how sweet the sound.
[26:38] Yeah. I tell you what, it might be a
[26:40] cowboy mansion, but it'll be a big old
[26:42] log cabin.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm heir to it. See? Amen. You You
[26:49] see, it might be in the unseen. And you
[26:51] may say, "He has nothing, but he
[26:53] possesses all things as a son of
[26:55] Abraham." And I'm looking to that. I'm
[26:57] not looking to that in the millennium.
[26:59] And I think that is a bit of an issue
[27:01] that we push everything off to the
[27:04] millennium. But the prophet of God said,
[27:06] "We really need somebody to call the
[27:10] promises present tense right now." We we
[27:14] need something in us as Abraham's seed
[27:17] to call it present tense right now. It's
[27:21] not I'm going to be healed, I am healed.
[27:24] NOT THAT I'M GOING TO BE SAVED, I am
[27:26] saved. AMEN. THIS IS NOT A FUTURE EVENT.
[27:29] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE POSSESS RIGHT
[27:31] HERE THIS MORNING. AND GOD HAS PREPARED
[27:34] FOR YOU A TABLE RIGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF
[27:36] YOUR ENEMY. AND THE ENEMY TRYING TO TAKE
[27:39] EVERYTHING AWAY FROM YOU. AND GOD FILLS
[27:41] THE TABLE UP AND SAYS, "IT'S all yours."
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're an heir. We're not
[27:47] going to be a son just in the
[27:49] millennium. We are sons right now.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's with me this morning?
[27:55] Are you a son right now? I'm a son right
[27:58] now. Not just in the millennium. I'm a
[28:00] son right now.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you it's a powerful
[28:04] thing when you see as being a son its
[28:07] inheritance and and let me continue in
[28:09] Hebrews. Hebrews 1 and verse uh three
[28:12] says that he sat down at the right hand
[28:14] of the majesty on high and being made
[28:17] better. Now this is Jesus being made
[28:19] better so much better than the angels as
[28:23] he hath by inheritance
[28:26] obtained a more excellent name than they
[28:30] excellent name than they. Who's he
[28:32] talking about? He's talking about a
[28:34] greater name than even the angels. NOW,
[28:36] NOW, NOW PAUL IS TALKING TO THESE JEWS.
[28:39] AMEN. And in their world, even in the
[28:42] tabernacle that Moses has built, there
[28:44] is cherubams that are over the ark of
[28:47] the covenant IN THE MOST HOLY PLACE. AND
[28:49] THESE, THEY KNOW ABOUT SARAPHIMS and
[28:51] they KNOW ABOUT MICHAEL AND THEY KNOW
[28:53] ABOUT GABRIEL AND THEY KNOW ABOUT THE
[28:55] GREAT ANGELS. AND HERE PAUL IS TELLING
[28:58] them a man that they have all crucified
[29:00] as a fanatic is has a name that is
[29:03] greater than the angels of heaven. My
[29:07] what a preacher. Amen. Th this this man
[29:09] that you have despised HAS GOT A GREATER
[29:12] name than even them that which is in
[29:14] heaven. Amen. And and he proves it by
[29:17] saying FOR UNTO WHICH of the angels hath
[29:20] he at any time said thou art my son and
[29:22] I have begotten thee? AMEN. WHEN DID GOD
[29:25] EVER TELL AN ANGEL, "You're my son and I
[29:27] have begotten thee." He never did that.
[29:29] He made THEM FLAMES OF FIRE and he made
[29:31] them ministering spirits, but he never
[29:34] gave them a throne to rule over the
[29:37] earth.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; My goodness, he highly exalted him. I I
[29:41] TELL YOU, PAUL was exalting Jesus
[29:44] Christ. And I don't think you can
[29:45] overexalt him.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; In Philippians, same writer, Philippians
[29:49] chapter 2, let's read it from a
[29:51] different perspective. Philippians
[29:52] chapter 2 and verse 9. Wherefore God
[29:55] also hath highly exalted him. Amen. And
[29:59] given him a name which is above every
[30:02] name, that the name of Jesus, he calls
[30:05] his name, don't he? And the name of
[30:07] Jesus, every knee should bow of things
[30:10] in heaven, things in earth, and things
[30:12] under the earth. And that every tongue
[30:14] should confess that Jesus is Lord to the
[30:17] glory of God the Father. Oh, I love
[30:20] that. Don't you? and he hath exalted him
[30:22] and given him a name that is above every
[30:25] name. You know, I I tried to do a little
[30:27] study last night, but you it's hard to
[30:30] it's hard to put a number on it, but
[30:31] they think there's nearly 117 billion
[30:34] people that has lived on planet Earth
[30:36] since it has began. That's a lot of
[30:38] names.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; There's currently about 8 billion people
[30:42] on Earth right now. And there is some
[30:45] very important people on this earth.
[30:47] There are presidents and there are kings
[30:49] and there's monarchies and there's every
[30:51] kind of humanity that's on the earth.
[30:53] But you could stand here and name 8
[30:56] billion names right now. And there is
[30:59] not one of those names you could name
[31:01] that would be above the NAME OF JESUS
[31:04] CHRIST. THERE IS NO PROPHET. THERE IS NO
[31:06] PRIEST. THERE IS NO KING. AMEN. WHAT HE
[31:09] WAS SAYING, LISTEN TO THIS. WHAT HIS MAN
[31:11] WAS SAYING, WHICH HE'S SAYING, "YOU GOT
[31:13] YOUR PROPHET MOSES, BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
[31:16] THE NAME OF JESUS IS HIGHER THAN THE
[31:19] NAME OF MOSES, THEN OF ISAIAH." COME ON,
[31:22] LET'S MOVE IT. AMEN. Let's move it IN
[31:23] THE NEW TESTAMENT. IT'S GREATER THAN THE
[31:25] NAME OF PAUL. IT'S GREATER. IT'S GREATER
[31:28] THAN THE NAME OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM. IT'S
[31:30] GREATER THAN LUTHER. IT'S GREATER THAN
[31:31] WESLEY. THIS NAME OF JESUS IS THE
[31:34] GREATEST OF ALL NAMES THAT HAVE EVER
[31:37] BEEN SPOKEN OFF OF HUMAN LIPS. THERE IS
[31:39] NO NAME. THERE IS NO PREACHER, THERE IS
[31:42] NO PROPHET, THERE IS NO ANGEL, THERE IS
[31:44] NOTHING IN HEAVENS OR IN EARTH OR
[31:47] BENEATH THE EARTH THAT HAS A name
[31:50] equivalent to the name of Jesus Christ.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; My goodness, that name, that name of
[31:56] Jesus, no wonder Paul was trying to tell
[31:59] the people, everything you do, do it in
[32:02] the name of Jesus Christ. WHEN YOU
[32:05] BAPTIZE, YOU SHOULD BAPTIZE IN THE NAME
[32:08] OF JESUS CHRIST. WHEN YOU PRAY FOR THE
[32:10] SICK, YOU GOT TO DO IT IN THE NAME OF
[32:13] JESUS CHRIST. WHEN YOU ASK FOR
[32:15] DELIVERANCE, DO IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[32:18] CHRIST. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT YOU can say
[32:21] the name of Jesus Christ? Amen. I I got
[32:24] a pretty decent memory at times, but
[32:26] it's not so good that I can remember all
[32:28] the redemptive names of God that I could
[32:31] stand here and tell you. I know there's
[32:33] seven of them. I can name them pretty
[32:34] good. You know, Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah
[32:37] Sha, Jehovah Shalom. Amen. We have
[32:39] Jehovah Rafi, Jehovah Sidkadoo. AMEN. WE
[32:42] WE RECOGNIZE that these names and
[32:44] there's seven redemptives that reveals
[32:46] the name of God. BUT WHEN MOSES MET HIM,
[32:48] he said he didn't have a name. Amen. He
[32:50] just said, "I am that I AM." BUT THERE
[32:52] WAS NO human name of redemption for all
[32:55] of mankind. AMEN. SO, THANK GOD THIS
[32:58] MORNING. I DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER 422
[33:01] NAMES TO FIND SOMETHING THAT HAS POWER
[33:04] OVER THE DEVIL. THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST
[33:07] IS A SUPREME NAME OVER ALL POWERS,
[33:10] WHETHER THEY BE EVIL OR HEAVENLY. THE
[33:13] NAME OF JESUS RULES over all names.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; My goodness, I love how Brother Bam did
[33:19] it and he comes and he he did it and
[33:21] then told us about it when he was in
[33:23] that great uh service over there in
[33:25] India. Remember that boy come up and he
[33:27] he had that man come up and he had a he
[33:30] was blind from worshiping the sun. And
[33:32] brother Bram said, "I just met with all
[33:34] of the great religions of that day,
[33:36] Hindus and and Buddhists." And he said,
[33:38] "I met with all of them." And he said,
[33:40] "That blind man come up who was blind
[33:43] from his religious worship.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; And he wanted a deliverance from that
[33:47] blindness." And he come to brother
[33:49] Brandham. And brother Bam said, "Look,
[33:50] here's a blind man standing right here."
[33:52] He said, "Now, one of you Hindus or one
[33:54] of you m I stood right where he stood. I
[33:57] literally stood in the same pulpit this
[33:59] happened in in India. And he stood there
[34:01] and he said to them, HE SAID, "WHICH OF
[34:03] YOUR religions can give a man back his
[34:06] sight? Let him come right now and do
[34:08] it."
[34:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask for just a a theological
[34:11] discussion or a debate as many today
[34:15] only exercise the power of debate AS
[34:18] SPIRITUAL OR AND LISTEN, I KNOW PEOPLE'S
[34:21] got Bibles and they preach and and seem
[34:23] like most time they're preaching against
[34:24] the movement of the spirit these days,
[34:26] but they can argue. BUT YOU TELL ME WHAT
[34:28] YOU CAN DO that a that a Muslim can't
[34:30] do. YOU CAN ARGUE A GOOD ARGUMENT, BUT A
[34:32] TERRORIST HAS A GOOD ARGUMENT. AMEN. BUT
[34:35] A CHRISTIAN SHOULD HAVE A POWER.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; THERE SHOULD BE A POWER IN THE CHURCH OF
[34:41] THE LIVING GOD. NOT JUST THE POWER OF
[34:43] DEBATE OR THE POWER OF AN ARGUMENT, BUT
[34:45] THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION OUGHT TO
[34:48] EXIST IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
[34:51] Oh my goodness. Brother Bam said, I
[34:53] don't, this is brother Bam's words. He
[34:55] said, "Some of these ministers today,"
[34:56] he said, "they carry the Bible but don't
[34:58] have enough power to break an egg."
[35:01] &gt;&gt; The only time they get anointed is when
[35:03] they're fussing about something. Well, I
[35:04] I think there ought to be an anointing
[35:06] ON PREACHING THE POWER OF THE
[35:08] RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST IN THIS
[35:10] GENERATION.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; You You know, Brother Bam actually
[35:13] invited them to come and heal come and
[35:15] heal this man. And brother Eric, they
[35:17] all sat still. And it's a good thing
[35:19] they did. But it WAS A A BIT JUST LIKE
[35:22] it was on Mount Carmel, wasn't it? There
[35:24] was Elijah again and there was all the
[35:26] religions of the world again. AND THEY
[35:28] SAT REAL QUIET BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEIR
[35:30] gods was only the form of their
[35:32] imagination OR SOME FALLEN ANGEL. BUT
[35:35] JESUS IS THE ONLY GOD. HE'S THE ONLY
[35:38] REAL GOD. AND BROTHER RAM SAID, "NOW
[35:40] SINCE YOUR GODS CAN'T DO THIS IN THE
[35:43] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, LET HIS EYES COME
[35:46] OPEN." OPEN. Brother said when HIS EYES
[35:47] COME OPEN, HE SAID THEY ALL BEGIN TO
[35:49] REJOICE and they like to tore the
[35:51] clothes off of brother Brandham because
[35:52] he was a representative of Jesus Christ
[35:54] and they sing the power EXHIBITED AND
[35:57] HIS EYES COME OPEN. THAT same thing
[35:58] happened in Africa and 30,000 GAVE THEIR
[36:02] LIFE IN ONE ALTAR CALL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
[36:05] JUST HAVE A DEBATE, HE HAD A POWER AND
[36:08] THAT POWER WAS THE POWER OF THE
[36:10] RESURRECTION.
[36:12] MY WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.
[36:14] OH, I PRAY WE DON'T RE THAT WE DON'T
[36:16] RELAX OURSELVES JUST TO A GOOD DEBATE
[36:19] TACTIC OR GOOD THEOLOGIAN. BUT I PRAY
[36:22] THAT THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTED ONE IS
[36:25] STILL ALLOWED IN THE CHURCH OF THE
[36:27] LIVING GOD.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; I tell you THIS IS ONE CHURCH THAT'LL
[36:31] NOT SHUT their doors to it.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; It's Leodysa church. He's on the
[36:36] outside. Brother Bam said well I tell
[36:37] you thank God we're not the Leodysian
[36:39] church. We've opened our doors and said,
[36:41] "Come on in here, Lord, and you be the
[36:43] Lord of our church. You be the LORD OF
[36:45] OUR LIVES. YOU HEAL THEM. YOU DELIVER
[36:47] THEM. YOU FILL THEM. YOU COME AMONG US.
[36:49] AND YOU CAN BE WORSHIPED LIKE YOU could
[36:51] worship in heaven.
[36:56] Highly exalted."
[36:58] &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bram does things cuz
[37:00] he talks about that witch doctor right
[37:02] over in Indiana. And he said they
[37:04] brought him in said, "Brother Bam,
[37:05] you're supposed to be a powerhouse and
[37:06] they made a table float. Witchcraft's
[37:08] real. I it's it's a real perversion of
[37:11] truth. And and brother Bam actually said
[37:14] it's odd. I I don't I'm not on
[37:15] preachers, but brother Bam said it's
[37:17] actually HE SAID HE SAID I would rather
[37:19] have breakfast, he said, with a bunch of
[37:21] witch doctors than a bunch of preachers.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Now, now you said, why did he do that?
[37:26] Because at least the witch doctors
[37:27] understood there is a supernatural.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; And he was trying to explain to them. He
[37:32] said, now these these heathens know
[37:34] there's a supernatural to the to the
[37:37] atmosphere. Yeah.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Some of us don't know
[37:40] that."
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; And and Brother Brandham was explaining
[37:43] that, but then they took him over there.
[37:45] And I doubt he really wanted to have a
[37:47] breakfast with a a witch doctor. I think
[37:49] he was just making comparison. But but
[37:52] that table, Brother Bam said he walked
[37:53] in that room, they had a seance going
[37:55] on. They had a table floating. And he
[37:56] said when he looked at that table, they
[37:58] said they were grown men hanging on the
[38:00] corner of that table trying to pull it
[38:01] down and they couldn't do it. So human
[38:03] strength couldn't pull it down. And they
[38:06] said to brother Bandham, "Can you make
[38:07] it come down?" He said, "No, I'm sorry.
[38:09] I can't." And he said, "But but I know
[38:11] one that can," you know. And so he looks
[38:13] at this and Brother Bam does it on
[38:15] purpose. And he said, "I said in the
[38:16] name of the Holy Roman Church, table,
[38:19] you come down." He said, "It just stayed
[38:21] right there." He said, "I said, in the
[38:23] name of the Father and the name of the
[38:25] Son and the name of the Holy Ghost,
[38:27] table, come down." He said, "It stayed
[38:28] right there." And I love it. And he
[38:31] said, I said, "IN THE NAME OF WILLIAM
[38:33] BRANDHAM, TABLE, come down." and it
[38:35] stayed right there. He said, "But then I
[38:37] let them know where the power lays in
[38:39] the name OF JESUS CHRIST." TABLE COME
[38:42] DOWN. HE SAID, "THE LEGS ALMOST BROKE
[38:45] WHEN THEY WERE COMING TO THE GROUND."
[38:47] YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S POWER IN
[38:49] THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. HIS NAME IS TO
[38:52] BE EXALTED ABOVE ALL NAMES. IT'S THE
[38:56] POWER OF YOUR HEALING. IT'S THE POWER OF
[38:58] YOUR SALVATION. IT'S THE POWER OF MY
[39:02] LIFE. IT'S THE POWER OF THIS CHURCH.
[39:05] IT'S THE POWER of the name of Jesus
[39:08] Christ. My goodness, I recognize today
[39:11] that we have that we are in an age,
[39:13] amen, when everything has tried to make
[39:15] him just another prophet or just a
[39:18] brother OR HE'S JUST SOME SOUSSAYER OR
[39:21] SOME TEACHER. AMEN. BUT I DEFY THAT
[39:24] UNBELIEVING DEVIL. HE IS THE SUPREME GOD
[39:27] OF HEAVEN AND EARTH AND HE IS THE OBJECT
[39:29] OF OUR WORSHIP. My apostle Paul was
[39:33] straight on the matter in Ephesians
[39:35] chapter 1. He said, "His exceeding
[39:37] greatness of his power toward us believe
[39:39] according to the working of his power
[39:41] which he wrought in Christ, raised him
[39:43] from the dead, set him at the right hand
[39:45] in heavenly places." You know that
[39:47] that's not two thrones up there. You
[39:50] know that Jesus sits in the authority of
[39:54] the power of almighty God. IT'S FAR
[39:57] ABOVE. I LOVE THAT. FAR. SOMEBODY SAY
[39:59] FAR ABOVE.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST ABOVE. IT'S FAR ABOVE the
[40:03] principality and power and might and
[40:06] dominion and every name that is named.
[40:10] My we should take a week on names. YOU
[40:13] SAY IT. JUST SAY IT RIGHT NOW AND I TELL
[40:14] YOU IT'S ABOVE IT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER,
[40:16] WHAT ABOUT CANCER?" THE NAME OF JESUS IS
[40:18] ABOVE IT. WHAT ABOUT SCOLIOSIS? THE NAME
[40:21] OF JESUS IS ABOVE IT. WHAT ABOUT
[40:23] STROKES? THE NAME OF JESUS IS ABOVE IT.
[40:26] I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR BLINDNESS, BUT I
[40:28] KNOW ABOUT MY JESUS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
[40:30] YOUR TRIAL, BUT I KNOW THERE'S A GOD AND
[40:33] THERE'S A POWER OVER THE TRIAL. HIS NAME
[40:36] IS JESUS. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT YOU CALL
[40:37] IT OR WHAT NAME IS GIVEN. GOD GAVE ME
[40:40] one answer for the whole thing.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I'M SUFFERING WITH
[40:44] DEPRESSION. HIS NAME IS JESUS. I'VE GOT
[40:47] ANXIETY. HIS NAME IS JESUS.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; You You just keep naming it. I just
[40:52] going to put one name back.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[40:56] It's it's the winning answer, folks.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; It's the winning answer. And we're not
[41:01] just saying a name. We have a revelation
[41:03] of that name.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Do you do you see? He's above every
[41:07] dominion, above every name. That is
[41:09] named not only in this world,
[41:13] &gt;&gt; BUT ALSO IN THAT WHICH IS TO COME. SOME
[41:16] PEOPLE THINK Jesus just going to be a
[41:17] brother in millennium. THAT'S A HERETIC.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; GOD AWFUL DOCTRINE. JESUS AIN'T JUST OUR
[41:23] BROTHER. HE'S OUR LORD.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID THERE WOULDN'T EVEN BE A
[41:27] NEED OF A TEMPLE IN THE NEW JERUSALEM
[41:30] BECAUSE THE LAMB WOULD BE THE CENTER OF
[41:31] OUR WORSHIP.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; He had put all things under his feet and
[41:37] given the head of all all things to the
[41:39] church. That's when brother Bram stops
[41:41] and says, "Listen, if you're even the
[41:43] skin on the bottom of the foot of Jesus
[41:45] Christ, you're above the devil.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE THE WEAKEST person
[41:50] in this building, BUT IF YOU'RE IN
[41:51] CHRIST, YOU'RE OVER THE DEVIL." AMEN.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; THEN THAT MEANS HE'S WEAKER AND HE'S
[41:56] BEEN DEFEATED. HE'S BEEN PUT UNDER IT.
[41:58] AND YOU JUST NEED TO GET OUT FROM UNDER
[42:01] WHATEVER SPIRIT THAT WON'T LET YOU
[42:03] BELIEVE THAT. WHATEVER DEVIL HAS TRIED
[42:05] TO COMPARE THAT YOUR SITUATION IS
[42:08] GREATER THAN THE NAME OF JESUS, THAT IS
[42:10] A DEMON OF UNBELIEF. AND YOU NEED TO
[42:13] REBUKE IT THIS MORNING AND SAY, "MY GOD
[42:16] IS A GOD OF SALVATION AND OF HEALING AND
[42:19] A GOD OF DELIVERANCE." AND INSTEAD OF
[42:21] GETTING UNDERNEATH THE THING, START
[42:22] WORSHIPING THE GOD WHO CAN DELIVER YOU
[42:25] OF THE THING.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; I believe it this morning. Somebody
[42:30] said, "Well, Bo,
[42:31] look." Now, Paul Paul actually is
[42:33] quoting seven Old Testament scriptures
[42:35] in the next few verses. And the and one
[42:37] of the scriptures he's using, for which
[42:39] the angels ever said, "Set thou uh the
[42:42] Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou my
[42:44] right hand until I make thine enemies
[42:46] thy foottools." That's Psalms 110
[42:48] verse1.
[42:50] Jesus uses that own scripture to
[42:52] describe who he was. And then also these
[42:56] apostles and disciples knew that Jesus
[43:00] was fulfilling that messianic prophecy
[43:03] of Psalms 110 that he would set at his
[43:06] right hand. And just quickly, we'll run
[43:08] through these so you can have them. Mark
[43:10] 16 19 and 20. And after the Lord had
[43:13] spoken, he was received up into heaven
[43:15] and set on the right hand of God. Amen.
[43:18] watching the in in Acts chapter 2. It's
[43:21] hard to fly through this one. It's so
[43:23] powerful. Acts 2 and 29. This is one
[43:25] save 3,000 about 15 minute sermon. Men
[43:29] and Peter, men and brethren, freely
[43:31] speak unto you of the patriarch David.
[43:32] He is both dead and buried and is in the
[43:34] septic with us today. Therefore, being a
[43:37] prophet and knowing that God has swore
[43:39] an oath to him that the fruit of his
[43:42] loins according to the flesh, he would
[43:44] raise up Christ to sit on the throne.
[43:47] seeing this before, spake of the
[43:48] resurrection of Christ, that his soul
[43:51] was not left in hell. There's Psalm 16.
[43:53] Neither his flesh did see corruption.
[43:56] This Jesus hath God raised up. Wherefore
[44:00] we are all witnesses. Therefore, being
[44:02] by the right hand of God, exalted, and
[44:05] having received of the Father the
[44:06] promise of the Holy Ghost, and he has
[44:09] shed forth this, and ye now see and
[44:12] hear. FOR DAVID is not ascended under
[44:15] the heavens, but saith himself, The Lord
[44:18] said unto my Lord, set thou at my right
[44:21] hand until I make thine enemy thy
[44:23] foottool. Therefore, let all the house
[44:25] of Israel know assuredly that God hath
[44:28] made this same Jesus that you crucified
[44:32] both Lord and Christ. Now, watch what
[44:36] Peter is telling them. HE IS THE
[44:38] FULFILLMENT OF MESSIANIC PROPHECIES. JAW
[44:40] KILLED HIM, BUT GOD RAISED HIM UP AND
[44:42] EXALTED HIM TO THE THRONE OF GOD. AND
[44:45] TODAY HE SITS THERE IN ALL supreme power
[44:49] in Ephesians 1:20. You can write them
[44:51] down if you want. 1:20. And he sat at
[44:53] the right hand in heavenly places. In
[44:55] Hebrews 12 and2, he sat down at the
[44:58] right hand on the throne of God. In
[45:00] Romans 8 and34, amen, Christ died, yet
[45:03] rather is risen again who is at the
[45:06] right hand of God. These men were
[45:07] driving a point. He's not in that tomb
[45:10] y'all put him in. God lifted him up
[45:12] bodily, raised him up and set him in
[45:15] heaven on the throne. In Hebrews chapter
[45:18] 1 and verse three, Paul has just said
[45:20] that sat down at the right hand. In
[45:22] Hebrews 8 and1, he sits on the right
[45:25] hand of the throne and majesty on high.
[45:28] Hebrews 10 and 12, he sat down on the
[45:31] right hand of God. 1 Peter chapter 3 22.
[45:35] He has gone into heaven and is on the
[45:37] right hand of God. And angels and
[45:40] authorities and powers are made subject
[45:43] unto him. My these boys had a revelation
[45:47] of who Jesus was, didn't they? Amen.
[45:49] Think of this. And Revelations 3,
[45:51] Jesus's own revelation written through
[45:54] John. To him that overcomemeth will I
[45:56] sit with me in my throne as I have
[45:59] overcome and have sat down with my
[46:01] father in his throne.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; So you can see that he was highly
[46:06] exalted and he was set down at the right
[46:09] hand of God with supreme authority and
[46:13] power over heaven in even the earth and
[46:17] things under the earth. Now let's walk
[46:19] to the next verse in Hebrews 1 and
[46:21] verse4. being made much better than the
[46:24] angels by as an inheritance obtained a
[46:27] more excellent name than they. Listen to
[46:30] that. He came to the earth. They gave
[46:33] him the lowest name.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; But God gave him the greatest name.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; They gave him the lowest seat and God
[46:40] gave him the highest seat. He's the name
[46:43] which is exalted and nothing could stand
[46:46] before that name. For the fifth verse
[46:48] says, for unto which of the angels saith
[46:50] he at any time, Thou art my son, and
[46:54] this day I have begotten thee, and
[46:57] again, now here's another scripture. I
[46:59] will be to him a father, and he shall be
[47:02] to me a son. Now, Paul has put two Old
[47:05] Testament scriptures together here. And
[47:07] again, that's that's what he's doing.
[47:08] He's quoting one and then quoting
[47:10] another. Now, the word here today, I
[47:14] have begotten thee. In the Greek word,
[47:17] this is called monogenis. Uh, it's just
[47:20] spelled m o n o ge nees. I'm not a Greek
[47:23] theologian. To you visitors, uh, sorry,
[47:25] I'm southern and and and if I say it, it
[47:28] kind of sounds like Spanish, you know.
[47:33] See, that's why I don't joke.
[47:36] Now,
[47:38] Matt, we're counting on you, buddy.
[47:42] M O N O G E N E S monogenous. It's the
[47:47] only begotten
[47:49] or unique.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; In the Greek, it means one and only.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Look what he says here. For which of the
[47:59] angels had he says at any time,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; you're my one and only?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; He's never said that to any angel
[48:07] &gt;&gt; that thou have been begotten. I am your
[48:11] father and you are my son. Look what he
[48:14] says here. It's the first uh prophecy
[48:16] used here in this uh uh Hebrews 1 and5.
[48:20] Pull it up. Psalms chapter 2 and verse
[48:22] 7. I hope y'all come with your Bibles
[48:25] today.
[48:26] Amen. Zach said I tied uh most of the
[48:29] Bible to Hebrews chapter 1 and 2. Well,
[48:30] I'm going to get the rest of it on
[48:31] Hebrews 2 4-14.
[48:34] Psalms chapter 2 verse 7. and I will
[48:37] declare the decree, the Lord hath said
[48:40] unto me, thou art my son, and this day
[48:45] have I begotten thee. Now, this is an
[48:47] Old Testament scholar. Paul is, and he's
[48:50] reaching into the Old Testament to
[48:52] identify this Jesus, who he really is
[48:56] according to David's prophecies, Jesus
[48:59] is the fulfillment. If you look for an
[49:01] answer to Psalms 2 and 7 outside of
[49:04] Jesus, you're going to be very
[49:06] discouraged.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And look then, and again, I will
[49:11] be to him a father, and he shall be to
[49:13] me a son. So Paul again is quoting
[49:16] scripture. The scripture he's quoting is
[49:18] prophecy from 2 Samuel 7 13- 14. These
[49:23] are prophecies concerning Solomon, but
[49:25] not really.
[49:27] They're really concerning the son of
[49:28] David who would be the Messiah king over
[49:31] Jerusalem. And again, watch. I will be
[49:34] to him a father, and he shall be to me a
[49:37] son. Do y'all notice this is future
[49:39] tense? I will be to him
[49:42] &gt;&gt; and he shall be to me. Watch in 2
[49:45] Samuel. Amen. He shall build a house for
[49:47] my name. I will establish the throne of
[49:49] his kingdom forever. I will be, this is
[49:53] again future tense, I will be his father
[49:55] and he shall be my son. Now, isn't it
[49:59] amazing because brother Brandham teaches
[50:01] us a very powerful lesson in the message
[50:03] and he said you hear these uh uh people
[50:06] going around religious people and he
[50:07] said they keep talking about the eternal
[50:10] son of God. He said there is no such
[50:13] thing as eternal son.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; BROTHER B MAKES A HUGE POINT ABOUT THIS.
[50:18] THERE IS NO ETERNAL SON BECAUSE AMEN.
[50:21] WHAT THEY'RE trying to do is to say that
[50:24] the son is one God out OF THREE GODS.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; BUT WATCH WHAT THE BIBLE IS SAYING. I
[50:30] will be his father and he shall be. IN
[50:33] OTHER WORDS, THERE WAS NO ETERNAL
[50:35] SUNSHIP. THERE WAS NO SON FLESH at that
[50:38] time. BUT HE WAS PROPHESYING THAT I WILL
[50:41] HAVE A BEGOTTEN SON. Now what's this
[50:43] really saying? Brother Brandham says it
[50:45] like this. He said it's a revelation of
[50:47] how God was manifested in the human
[50:49] flesh and revealed to us. And that's why
[50:52] he becomes a son of God.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; That's why God becomes a son. Isn't that
[50:59] amazing? People say, "Well, Jesus was a
[51:01] man that become God." I say he was God
[51:03] to become man.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Not a God, the God.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Now, WATCH WHAT HE DOES. BROTHER B SAID,
[51:11] "THAT'S BECAUSE he becomes a son of God.
[51:13] He's a part of God." You understand the
[51:15] body is a part of God. A son, as the
[51:18] Catholic puts it, I was going to hide
[51:20] that. He didn't. As a Catholic puts it,
[51:22] eternal son. And all of the rest of the
[51:25] churches, the word didn't even make
[51:28] sense. There cannot be eternal and then
[51:31] be a son. A son is something THAT IS
[51:34] BEGOTTEN. NOW, WHAT WHAT WHAT Samuel and
[51:38] what Paul are putting together is the
[51:41] idea that this Jesus isn't a human being
[51:45] just becoming God or he isn't A
[51:48] PRE-EXISTENT son who has come down, but
[51:51] rather the God of heaven has became
[51:55] flesh AND MANIFESTED HIMSELF among the
[51:58] people. So Jesus did previously exist.
[52:01] Tell me knows that
[52:03] &gt;&gt; he pre previously existed as the
[52:05] offening in the beginning of John 1
[52:07] and1. He calls him in the beginning was
[52:10] the word and the word was with God and
[52:14] the word was God and the same was IN THE
[52:17] BEGINNING WITH God and things were made
[52:19] by him and without him there was nothing
[52:22] made. So John is confirming what what
[52:24] was said here. Amen. In the first parts
[52:27] of HEBREW THAT JESUS WAS THE CREATOR.
[52:30] BROTHER BRANDON PUTS IT IN THE CHURCH
[52:32] AGE BOOK. HE SAID, "AND THE LORD CREATED
[52:34] THE heavens and earth in six days." And
[52:37] what do we call Jesus? The same Lord and
[52:40] Christ. He's letting you know he was a
[52:42] creator. But watch what he was. He was a
[52:45] word before his flesh. Now, we'll get
[52:47] into who's Melazdc later, but you can
[52:49] see the pattern in John chapter 1 and
[52:51] verse1 14. Some people say, "Well, by
[52:53] the way, John 1 and1 had nothing to do
[52:55] with Jesus." Watch the 14th verse. And
[52:57] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[53:01] us. AMEN. AND WE BEHELD HIS GLORY AS THE
[53:05] GLORY of the be only begotten of the
[53:08] father full of grace and truth. And John
[53:11] bear witness and cried saying, "This is
[53:13] whom I spake. He that cometh after me is
[53:16] prepared before me. He was before me and
[53:19] the fullness we have all received and
[53:21] grace for grace. For the law was given
[53:24] by Moses, but grace and truth by JESUS
[53:27] CHRIST. FOR NO MAN HAS SEEN GOD AT ANY
[53:30] TIME. Only the begotten son which is in
[53:33] the bosom of the father hath declared
[53:35] him. He was telling them your INVISIBLE
[53:38] GOD HAS BECOME visible to you in the
[53:41] flesh of JESUS CHRIST. WHEN JESUS SAID,
[53:44] "AMEN. YOU SAY YOU WANT TO SEE THE
[53:45] FATHER. WHEN you see me, YOU HAVE SEEN
[53:49] THE FATHER
[53:50] &gt;&gt; because the father dwelleth in me.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I I look at the beauty of
[53:55] this of the uniqueness. Jesus wasn't
[53:57] unique, folks.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; He was the only begotten son of God. If
[54:03] you're studying this area of the
[54:04] pre-existence of Christ, brother Bram
[54:06] calls it pre-incarnate Christ. So, so
[54:09] the word begotten is dealing with the
[54:11] incarnation of Jesus in human flesh.
[54:14] pre-incarnate. He meets Abraham. Amen.
[54:17] He he actually meets him as Elohim or as
[54:20] Melazdc. He was the word. But brother
[54:23] Brandham is very specific. He said,
[54:24] "Watch when God, the word wanted to meet
[54:26] Abraham before HE BECAME JESUS, HE
[54:29] PICKED UP the dirt and BLEW A BODY AND
[54:33] STEPPED INTO THAT BODY. THAT WAS NOT A
[54:35] BEGOTTEN BODY.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; THAT DIDN'T COME THROUGH HUMANITY. It
[54:39] was not a kinsman TO ABRAHAM. HE COULD
[54:42] NOT STICK AROUND AND BE ABRAHAM'S
[54:44] SAVIOR. HE JUST GAVE HIM PROMISES AND
[54:47] SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE COMING OF HIS
[54:49] PRIESTHOOD. But look at the beauty of
[54:51] this folks. He was not the begotten son.
[54:54] HE WAS GOD PRE-INCARNATE. And Moses saw
[54:57] him, saw the back parts, saw he was a
[55:00] man. But when Jesus came to the earth,
[55:02] he was called the unique or the only
[55:05] begotten son of God. Amen. He is so
[55:08] unique. He is the only one. Amen. That
[55:11] was God fully manifested in the flesh.
[55:15] In first John 1, I wished I had a lot of
[55:18] time. I could show you Hebrews 1.
[55:20] Brother Bam talks about it. And then
[55:21] again, Christ revealed in his own word
[55:23] and he says you see a lot of him in
[55:24] Moses. And he said Joseph's life was
[55:26] almost perfect.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; It takes a prophet to pick these things
[55:30] up. And he said Joseph's life was so
[55:32] perfect. He said it was almost like it
[55:35] was him. He said, "But God let him make
[55:37] that one mistake
[55:39] &gt;&gt; so you'd know it wasn't him."
[55:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, Brother Random, what
[55:43] you just said mean a lot to me."
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was SO COLD. YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT
[55:48] IT WAS HIM, BUT GOD LET HIM MAKE that
[55:50] mistake so you knew it wasn't him.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I hope you're updating that.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ram made that mistake. God
[55:59] let it happen so you know that wasn't
[56:00] him.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; He's just his messenger.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; He's the seventh angel.
[56:08] Amen. You see in John chapter 1, John
[56:10] tells it again, that which was from the
[56:12] beginning, which we heard, WHICH WE SEEN
[56:14] WITH OUR EYES, WHICH WE HAVE LOOKED
[56:16] UPON, and our hands have handled the
[56:18] word of life. For life was manifested,
[56:21] and we seen it, and bear witness, and
[56:23] show unto you the eternal life, which
[56:25] was the father. Amen. In John chapter 3
[56:28] and verse 16 uses the same Greek word
[56:30] for God so loved the world that he gave
[56:33] his only begotten. Amen. The one and
[56:36] only unique flesh son of God. Because
[56:41] Jesus, amen, was not a Jew.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; AS MANY THINK, WELL, WE WORSHIP A JEW.
[56:46] NO, WE DON'T worship a Jew and we don't
[56:48] worship a Gentile. Brother man told us
[56:51] we're worshiping God
[56:53] &gt;&gt; because the father's blood is what's in
[56:56] a man.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the blood that was in Jesus
[56:59] WAS MORE THAN JUST HUMAN BLOOD, FOLKS.
[57:02] It was the BLOOD OF GOD THROUGH A
[57:05] CREATIVE ACT HAD COME upon the face of
[57:08] the earth. Brother Bam said it like
[57:09] this. See, he was the second Adam. THE
[57:12] FIRST ADAM WAS GOD'S SON, but he was
[57:14] created. But Jesus was a begotten son
[57:18] because he had to come through a woman.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're looking in the Bible in
[57:22] Luke chapter 1, it tells how God got in
[57:25] the flesh. Now, if you like to study
[57:27] this, and I know some of your real
[57:28] studies, I know you get up early,
[57:31] Brother Guthrie, I know you, you know,
[57:33] you're pre-work guy and maybe an hour in
[57:35] the morning or something. Look into this
[57:36] powerful right here. Amen. Because what
[57:38] he's what he's telling us in the church
[57:40] age book, he's telling us how the
[57:42] serpent seed came into the flesh and
[57:44] gives the account of Genesis 3. Remember
[57:46] that the serpent seed came through Eve
[57:49] by the flesh. Amen. But then the Bible
[57:52] speaks of an imposing seed called the
[57:54] woman's seed. But we don't see how the
[57:57] woman seed comes into the flesh. Until
[57:59] you get in the New Testament AND IN THE
[58:01] BOOK OF LUKE, YOU'LL FIND in the 30th
[58:03] verse, IT SAYS HERE THAT MARY, A
[58:06] 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL, IS WALKING ON HER WAY.
[58:08] BROTHER BRIM said she was thinking about
[58:10] the Lord and an angel stepped out to her
[58:13] and SAID, "BEHOLD, THOU SHALT CONCEIVE
[58:15] in thy womb and bring forth a son, and
[58:18] thou shalt call his name Jesus." Now,
[58:19] isn't that beautiful? Because Mary
[58:21] didn't come up with that name.
[58:24] That name was given to HER BECAUSE IT
[58:27] MEANT JEHOVAH'S elected salvation.
[58:29] JEHOVAH SAVES. AND GOD ALREADY HAD THAT
[58:33] NAME and it was given to her because it
[58:36] was the father's name.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And he shall be great and he shall be
[58:41] called the son of the highest. And the
[58:42] Lord shall give him the throne of his
[58:44] father David. And he shall reign over
[58:46] the house of Jacob and the kingdom shall
[58:48] be no end. Then Mary said unto the
[58:50] angel, "How shall this be? saying, "I
[58:52] know not a man." Good question. Amen.
[58:54] And the angel answered, said unto her,
[58:57] "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
[58:59] and the power of the highest shall
[59:02] overshadow thee, AND THOU HOLY things
[59:04] shall be born, shall be called the son
[59:07] of God." Isn't that beautiful? That's
[59:10] how God came into the flesh. You're
[59:13] reading the records that is the opposing
[59:16] record to what happened in the garden of
[59:18] Eden now happens in the earth to oppose
[59:22] it. So this woman's seed had to come
[59:25] according to the book of Jeremiah. It
[59:27] said a woman shall compass a man in the
[59:30] and and we find it here in Isaiah 7 and
[59:33] verse 14. Isaiah prophesied it and said,
[59:36] "The Lord himself shall give you a sign,
[59:38] and behold, a virgin shall conceive and
[59:41] bear a son, and thou shalt call his name
[59:44] Emmanuel."
[59:46] Now, if you think Jesus was just a man,
[59:48] it's amazing because when Joseph was
[59:50] excited about his uh newly espoused wife
[59:53] becoming expecting, and he had never
[59:55] been with her, they wasn't yet fully
[59:57] married. Amen. And the angel appeared to
[1:00:00] him and said, "Don't you fear to take
[1:00:02] her, for that which is conceived in her
[1:00:05] is of the Holy Ghost."
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Now, now it was done according to
[1:00:10] scripture. Amen. The Bible said, "This
[1:00:12] was done that it might be fulfilled
[1:00:14] which was spoken of the Lord by the
[1:00:16] prophets, saying, Behold, a virgin shall
[1:00:19] be with child and bring forth a son, and
[1:00:22] thou shalt call his name Emmanuel."
[1:00:25] Amen. Isn't it beautiful? In Luke 1 and
[1:00:29] verse 35, the Bible said, "The Holy
[1:00:31] Ghost shall be upon thee, and thou
[1:00:33] highest shall overshadow thee, and the
[1:00:36] holy thing WHICH SHALL BE BORN of thee
[1:00:39] shall be called the son of God." To
[1:00:42] which of the ANGELS DID HE EVER say
[1:00:45] that?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; That he shall be called the son of God.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; now, folks, this is to me one of the
[1:00:53] greatest cases of the Christian
[1:00:54] religion.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And seemingly the quickest fading
[1:00:58] subject among Christianity is the virgin
[1:01:01] birth of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; If Jesus was not virgin born, then the
[1:01:07] whole Christian religion is a wreck.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; But I attest the idea that it was
[1:01:14] somehow Mary and Joseph OR IT WAS
[1:01:17] SOMEHOW MARY AND JUST A SPIRIT. I SAY
[1:01:21] THAT THE BLOOD of Jesus Christ came from
[1:01:24] God AND THE EGG ALSO came from God.
[1:01:27] AMEN. THERE WAS NOT AN IMMACULATE
[1:01:29] conception such as the Catholic Church
[1:01:31] will teach. Now I I don't want to get in
[1:01:33] Catholic doctrine but folks they teach
[1:01:35] Mary was virgin born herself. They
[1:01:37] called it the immaculate sinless heart
[1:01:39] of Mary and somehow she didn't come into
[1:01:41] the earth through sin desire. Amen. So
[1:01:43] that's the only reason she was favored
[1:01:45] to bring forth. And that ain't nothing
[1:01:47] but a lie. BECAUSE THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:01:49] SAID HAD MARY, HAD MARY NOT WENT TO THE
[1:01:52] upper room, SHE COULDN'T HAVE GOT INTO
[1:01:54] HEAVEN BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST AS SINFUL AS
[1:01:57] YOU AND I WERE SINFUL AND NEEDED THE
[1:01:59] BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. MARY HAD NOTHING
[1:02:03] TO DO WITH OUR SALVATION. SHE WAS AN
[1:02:06] INCUBATOR.
[1:02:08] SHE GAVE GOD A BODY THAT HE COULD USE TO
[1:02:11] BRING FORTH A SON. AND THAT SON SAVED
[1:02:14] the world.
[1:02:15] My goodness. Brother Bam says, "Amen.
[1:02:17] Life come from the bloodstream." And in
[1:02:19] this case, there was no male sex. Now,
[1:02:21] if you want to go back far enough, you
[1:02:23] can find this with Adam and Eve. When
[1:02:24] God created Adam, he created he them.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Male and female. Don't tell me God
[1:02:31] couldn't put male and female in the womb
[1:02:33] of Mary. One time, Brother Bam said it
[1:02:35] like this. Is okay if I preach? I If you
[1:02:37] need the quote, I can give it to you.
[1:02:39] Brother Bam said it like this. He said,
[1:02:40] "You could have took that and put it on
[1:02:42] a stump and it would have brought life.
[1:02:44] Because it wasn't Mary or Joseph. It was
[1:02:48] the ETERNAL GOD CREATING A BODY TO COME
[1:02:52] INTO THE EARTH TO MANIFEST HIS GLORY AND
[1:02:55] his power. It was God. Paul says it in 1
[1:02:57] Timothy 3:16. AMEN. WITHOUT CONTROVERSY,
[1:03:01] GREAT IS THIS MYSTERY. BUT GOD WAS
[1:03:04] MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; WOO! GLORY. GOD WAS MANIFESTED in the
[1:03:11] flesh. I love how Brother Brandham says
[1:03:13] it. Amen. He said, "Look at this." He
[1:03:15] and he quotes it OVER AND OVER. THAT GOD
[1:03:18] WAS IN CHRIST. THAT'S THE MYSTERY.
[1:03:21] THAT'S THE MYSTERY of God. You watch
[1:03:23] Brother Random tell it in the tomb of
[1:03:24] Gardia. It's a powerful story. And he
[1:03:27] builds up that tomb of Gardia and talks
[1:03:28] about that man Legion. You remember? And
[1:03:31] how Legion so troubled and he's so
[1:03:33] bound. And brother says, "But when Jesus
[1:03:35] got out of the boat, a little frail man,
[1:03:37] he said that Legion rose up in that man
[1:03:39] and said, "I'll go destroy this man.
[1:03:42] I'll go destroy this man they called
[1:03:44] Jesus. AND HE SAID WHEN THAT THING BEGAN
[1:03:46] to roar at him, he said Jesus finally
[1:03:48] lifted his head and looked into the eyes
[1:03:51] of Legion. He said LEGION SCREAMED OUT
[1:03:54] AND SAID, "WHAT are you doing in there?"
[1:03:58] Because he recognized THAT THERE WAS
[1:04:00] MORE THAN A LITTLE FRAIL MAN STANDING
[1:04:03] THERE. THERE WAS MORE THAN AN UNCUMBLY
[1:04:06] MAN STANDING THERE. THE GOD OF HEAVEN
[1:04:09] HAD COME DOWN IN THAT HUMAN BODY AND
[1:04:12] THAT DEVIL COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW DID
[1:04:14] THE GOD OF HEAVEN GET IN THAT BODY.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT. AMEN. A LOT OF PEOPLE
[1:04:20] don't know how God GOT IN THAT BODY.
[1:04:22] I'LL TELL YOU HOW HE GOT IN IT. HE
[1:04:24] OVERPOWERED and overshadowed. AMEN.
[1:04:27] MARY'S WOMB AND BROUGHT LIFE AND A BIRTH
[1:04:30] CAME FROM that body and it was called
[1:04:32] the son of God, begotten son of God. You
[1:04:36] know, the devil's still confused about
[1:04:37] that birth stuff cuz he don't even
[1:04:39] believe in that new birth cuz he THINKS
[1:04:41] THAT A CHILD of Abraham, Amen. That's
[1:04:43] why he he does all of his teachings and
[1:04:45] man does all their understandings. But
[1:04:47] I'll say this, DO YOU KNOW GOD has a new
[1:04:49] birth today that'll bring THAT SAME
[1:04:51] CREATOR AND put him right in your body
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; and it's a mystery to the world and it's
[1:04:58] a mystery to others. But brother Bam
[1:05:00] SAID, "LOOK, IF YOU DON'T HAVE NOTHING
[1:05:01] TO PREACH," AND I KNOW EVERYBODY got
[1:05:03] something to preach now because we got a
[1:05:05] message, but back in that early years,
[1:05:06] Brother Bam said it. He said, "You don't
[1:05:08] have to wait till you get a great
[1:05:09] education to go preach the gospel." HE
[1:05:11] SAID, "GO TELL THEM HOW YOUR candle got
[1:05:13] lit. GO TELL THEM HOW GOD GOT IN YOU. GO
[1:05:16] TELL THEM THAT YOU WENT TO a service and
[1:05:18] you just WANTED TO REPENT AND GO TO AN
[1:05:20] ALTAR AND WHEN YOU KNELT DOWN, THE HOLY
[1:05:23] GHOST COME OVER TO YOU. AND WHEN I GOT
[1:05:25] UP, I WAS DIFFERENT." AMEN. I TELL YOU
[1:05:27] WHAT, SOMETIMES I THINK WE OUGHT TO
[1:05:29] BRING IT BACK TO REALITY THAT GOD
[1:05:31] CHANGES LIVES. That's what changes
[1:05:33] lives.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A BUNCH OF THERAPY THERAPIES
[1:05:37] AND PSYCHOLOGIES AND ALL THESE THINGS
[1:05:39] THAT DON'T CHANGE LIVES.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I know it's old news to you, but but
[1:05:45] it's still the truth, folks.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God was in Christ. Brother said
[1:05:50] God was in Christ reconciling the world.
[1:05:52] That blood cell being broken released
[1:05:55] God.
[1:05:58] It released God. If anybody would
[1:06:00] misinterpret Jesus in the Bible of not
[1:06:02] being God himself, then you would make
[1:06:05] it the second person or one God out of
[1:06:07] three, it would upset the entire Bible.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; And most importantly, it would break the
[1:06:14] first commandment
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; that thou shalt not have any god before
[1:06:18] me.
[1:06:20] It would make the whole Christian race a
[1:06:22] bunch of pagan worshippers
[1:06:25] by having different gods. I love how
[1:06:27] brother Bam says it. He says, "See, it
[1:06:30] can't be known intellectually. It must
[1:06:32] be known spiritually by a spiritual
[1:06:35] revelation."
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Now, here is the revelation. Thou that
[1:06:40] is a revelation. Jesus Christ is God.
[1:06:42] The Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[1:06:45] Jesus of the New Testament. No matter
[1:06:48] how hard you try, you cannot prove there
[1:06:52] are three gods.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; It takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit
[1:06:55] to make you understand the truth that
[1:06:58] there is one.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says, "I admit it takes
[1:07:01] a revelation to see it." Now, if you
[1:07:04] look at these scriptures, it's what Paul
[1:07:06] is doing here, and I I think it's
[1:07:07] amazing is Paul is calling Jesus unique
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; because he's telling you that God came
[1:07:15] into this man. Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just a man. He was a unique
[1:07:19] man. He was the head of a new race
[1:07:22] called a God man.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Now the the the theologians up through
[1:07:28] the ages come up with a what they called
[1:07:30] a hypoatic union. How many remembers me
[1:07:32] using that term hypoatic union? It's a
[1:07:34] it's actually a theological term and you
[1:07:36] probably don't need to know it. You can
[1:07:37] just say a union. We could call it a H
[1:07:40] union if you want to. And uh but but
[1:07:42] it's a union. And the reason they
[1:07:44] developed it, brother Gabe, because they
[1:07:45] knew anytime you put two things
[1:07:47] together, it changes those two things.
[1:07:49] You you can't actually put two things
[1:07:51] together without changing it. But they
[1:07:53] called this a hypothatic union, saying
[1:07:56] that there was a union between God and
[1:07:59] Jesus that they could put man and God
[1:08:02] together and remain God and man.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; So if somebody says, "Well, Jesus was
[1:08:08] all God." Amen.
[1:08:10] But you but you can't make him less than
[1:08:13] man or you can't make him greater than
[1:08:16] man
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; or you have removed that he's your
[1:08:19] kinsman.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; So he was ALL GOD. BUT YOU GOT TO also
[1:08:24] recognize he was all man.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And being all man made him your kinsman.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; He can't be your kinsman UNLESS HE FACED
[1:08:34] THE SAME TEMPTATIONS YOU FACED. UNLESS
[1:08:37] UNLESS EVERY PART OF YOU WAS REPRESENTED
[1:08:40] IN HIM BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID HE became
[1:08:43] me.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Now watch the beauty of this. It's the
[1:08:47] only begotten. Now this is this is where
[1:08:50] this is where this is going to take
[1:08:51] another whole level because the
[1:08:53] implications of what Paul is saying here
[1:08:57] it really gets powerful in the next
[1:08:59] verse. Watch this in Hebrews 1 and6. And
[1:09:02] again, when he bringeth in the first
[1:09:05] begotten into the world, he saith, "And
[1:09:08] let all the angels of God worship him."
[1:09:13] Oh my goodness. Here is Paul speaking to
[1:09:17] the Jews that their very first
[1:09:19] commandment is to have no other god
[1:09:22] before them. AND NOT ONLY IS PAUL
[1:09:24] OFFERING adoration and worship to this
[1:09:26] man, NOW HE'S SAYING GOD COMMANDED
[1:09:30] ANGELS to worship him. I'll tell you
[1:09:32] what. Amen. Now, it's a powerful thing.
[1:09:34] And and they say he's quoting Psalms
[1:09:36] 97:7. I'm not certain of that, but they
[1:09:39] confounded and serve graven images and
[1:09:41] boast themselves of idols. Worship him
[1:09:44] all you gods. Now, here's the here's the
[1:09:46] thing. He commanded angels to worship
[1:09:48] him. Now, brother Bam taught us
[1:09:50] something about the Godhead when he went
[1:09:52] back and Brother Bam said now before he
[1:09:55] was God, he said you got to watch the
[1:09:56] word God. He said he was actually
[1:09:58] Elohim, right? And and brother Bam said
[1:10:01] the reason he was called Elohim because
[1:10:03] he was self-existent. He said but he
[1:10:05] actually don't become God until after he
[1:10:08] creates angels
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; because angels are created for the
[1:10:13] purpose to worship God.
[1:10:15] Yes.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Now, now Brother Brandham would tell us
[1:10:17] this and and this is something this is
[1:10:19] for your refrigerator.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; But being that he was God, then there
[1:10:24] must be something to worship him because
[1:10:27] he loved worship.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; God loved worship. Have you ever thought
[1:10:33] about where worship comes from? Have you
[1:10:35] ever thought about the adorations and
[1:10:37] worship and the singing and the
[1:10:39] praising? Have y'all ever thought really
[1:10:40] where does that come from? H how did
[1:10:44] that get into the earth or into the
[1:10:46] world? It's because God loves worship
[1:10:49] and God was the one that created beings
[1:10:52] called angels. And those angels were
[1:10:55] specifically designed to worship God.
[1:10:59] Now there's a big point in this folks.
[1:11:01] If their design, brother Nathan, if the
[1:11:03] only purpose of the seraraphims and the
[1:11:05] angels, if their only purpose was to
[1:11:07] WORSHIP GOD, AND NOW PAUL IS SAYING THAT
[1:11:11] God commanded them to WORSHIP JESUS,
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; HE'S TELLING YOU THE GOD THAT WAS IN THE
[1:11:18] BEGINNING HAS BEEN MANIFEST IN THIS MAN,
[1:11:20] JESUS. AND SO MUCH THAT EVEN the angels
[1:11:24] are going to worship him,
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; the ones created to worship. I know.
[1:11:28] Amen. We get all kinds of ideas about
[1:11:30] worship. But you know, I think it's
[1:11:32] amazing that the creator himself, now
[1:11:34] there must have been some attribute in
[1:11:36] God that he would release that would
[1:11:38] create worship because these angels were
[1:11:40] designed for the purpose of worship. And
[1:11:42] and we see a a lot of places you don't
[1:11:45] catch a a glimpse of what's happening in
[1:11:47] heaven. But in the book of Isaiah, you
[1:11:49] actually get a door into the very throne
[1:11:52] of God in Isaiah chapter 6. In Isaiah 6
[1:11:56] and1, Amen. The Bible said that Isaiah
[1:11:58] of course he goes down when Uzziah dies
[1:12:01] and Isaiah he says I also saw the Lord
[1:12:04] sitting on the throne high and lifted up
[1:12:08] and his train filled the temple and
[1:12:11] above it stood saraphims. Each one had
[1:12:13] six wings and between he covered his
[1:12:16] face and between he covered his feet and
[1:12:19] between he did fly. Brother said if you
[1:12:21] want to know how to approach God there
[1:12:22] it is. Yeah.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; He said there that that that servant
[1:12:26] angel is teaching you how to approach
[1:12:28] the God of heaven. And he says, watch
[1:12:30] this. HE SAYS HIS TRAIN FILLED the
[1:12:31] temple and it stood there seraphims each
[1:12:35] one of them. Amen. They're covering his
[1:12:37] feet, covering his face and they did
[1:12:38] fly. AND THEY CRIED unto another and
[1:12:42] said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
[1:12:46] hosts. The whole earth is full of his
[1:12:50] glory." He knew what the angels were
[1:12:52] saying.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; He was hearing the worship of those
[1:12:55] angels. Holy, holy, holy. Thou art a set
[1:13:00] aart God. Thou art a God apart from all
[1:13:03] else. He was worshiping this God. And in
[1:13:06] the sixth chapter, the fourth verse.
[1:13:08] Amen. Watch this significant point. AND
[1:13:10] THE POST OF THE door moved at THE VOICE
[1:13:14] OF HIM THAT CRIED. NOW, BROTHER BAM in
[1:13:17] the message of influence of another
[1:13:19] picks up this breaks into the vision of
[1:13:21] Isaiah and he SAID WHEN THEY SPOKE THE
[1:13:24] PILLARS OF THE building shook at their
[1:13:26] voice. He says they wasn't just saying
[1:13:29] now holy, holy, holy. He said what a
[1:13:33] voice. The pillars moved AND SHOOK AT
[1:13:37] THEIR VOICE. THEY WERE SCREAMING. THOSE
[1:13:40] ANGELIC beings standing next to the side
[1:13:44] of God AND WAS SCREAMING HOLY, HOLY,
[1:13:48] HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. AND THEY WERE
[1:13:51] SCREAMING SO LOUD TO GOD, HOLY UNTIL THE
[1:13:55] doors begin to shake.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? Some of these uh
[1:13:59] some of these cold theologians in this
[1:14:00] LAST DAY ACTS LIKE GOD IS SOMEHOW afraid
[1:14:04] of people worshiping loud WHEN THE VERY
[1:14:07] ONE HE CREATED IN HEAVEN WAS SCREAMING
[1:14:10] SO LOUD IT WAS SHAKEN. COME ON CHURCH.
[1:14:14] AMEN. GOD WAS THE ONE THAT CREATED THAT
[1:14:16] ANGEL. GOD IS THE ONE THAT ANOINTED HIM
[1:14:19] TO DO IT. BROTHER SAID THAT'S NOT JUST
[1:14:21] EXCITEMENT RAISING UP in these people.
[1:14:24] HE SAID, "IT'S THE HOLY GHOST MOVING
[1:14:26] THROUGH THEM, CAUSING THEM."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; OH, glory be to God. SOMEBODY SAID,
[1:14:32] "BROTHER WAYNE, I tell you what, I'm
[1:14:34] going to need more than that." All
[1:14:35] right. Revelations 5 11. And I beheld
[1:14:38] voice of angels round about the throne.
[1:14:40] That was the beginning. This is the end.
[1:14:42] and the beast and the elders and the
[1:14:44] number of them was 10 times 10 thousands
[1:14:46] of thousands
[1:14:48] saying with a
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; same WITH A LOUD VOICE, WORTHY IS THE
[1:14:57] LAMB
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SLAIN TO RECEIVE POWER AND
[1:15:01] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:15:03] and GLORY AND BLESSING. AND EVERY
[1:15:06] creature which is in heaven and on the
[1:15:08] sea and under the earth and such as were
[1:15:10] in the SEA HEARD I. SO NOT ONLY WERE
[1:15:13] them angels with a loud voice, BROTHER
[1:15:16] BAM SAID, WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOHN.
[1:15:18] HE GOT SO LOUD THAT THEY HEARD THEM.
[1:15:21] AMEN. In the heavens and in the earth
[1:15:23] and under the earth, they heard John
[1:15:25] hollering blessing and glory and honor
[1:15:27] and power to him that siteth onto the
[1:15:29] throne and the lamb forever more. What
[1:15:32] was this man so excited about? He done
[1:15:34] saw his name in the lamb's book of life.
[1:15:37] And this IS THE VERY THING THAT JESUS
[1:15:39] SAID, "REJOICE NOT THAT YOU HAVE power
[1:15:41] over THE DEVILS. BUT YOU REJOICE THAT
[1:15:44] YOUR NAME HAS WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK
[1:15:46] OF LIFE." BROTHER B SAID, "OH," HE SAID,
[1:15:49] I'VE SEEN THEM STAND AND SCREAM AND
[1:15:51] SHOUT AND REJOICE. HE SAID, "BUT SEE,
[1:15:53] THEY SAW THEIR NAMES ON THE LAMB'S BOOK
[1:15:56] OF LIFE." YOU ASK ME WHY. AMEN. THAT
[1:15:58] WE'RE UNDIGNIFIED AND WE HAVE THIS LOUD
[1:16:01] WORSHIP AND WE HAVE SCREAMS AND HOWLERS
[1:16:04] AND HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE I HAVE SAW MY
[1:16:07] NAME ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. I'M
[1:16:10] GOING HOME, FOLKS. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
[1:16:12] DEVILS CAN STOP ME. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
[1:16:14] DEMONS CAN STOP ME. I HAVE BEEN GIVEN
[1:16:16] THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:16:19] AMEN.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; OH, I TELL YOU, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO
[1:16:22] JUST TELL THAT OLD, HEY, THAT OLD THAT
[1:16:24] OLD SKEPTICAL DEVIL, GET OUT OF MY WAY
[1:16:26] THIS MORNING, DEVIL. I COME TO WORSHIP
[1:16:28] GOD. I COME TO WORSHIP JESUS CHRIST. I
[1:16:31] DIDN'T COME HERE TO WORSHIP A PREACHER.
[1:16:34] I DIDN'T COME HERE TO WORSHIP JUST A
[1:16:36] SONG. I COME HERE TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF
[1:16:40] ABRAHAM. I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW HE'S
[1:16:43] MY SAVIOR. HE'S MY REDEEMER. HE'S MY
[1:16:45] HEALER. HE'S MY ALL AND ALL. I believe
[1:16:48] this morning we got a right to worship
[1:16:50] him. I believe we got a right to it,
[1:16:52] folks. Amen. So, well, by the way, I
[1:16:54] don't know. WELL, LISTEN. THEY THINK
[1:16:55] THAT SOUNDS PENTECOSTAL. WELL, LET ME
[1:16:57] SAY THIS. IF THEM UNSAVED, BACKSLID,
[1:17:00] DRUNKEN PENTECOSTALS, WOMEN BOBBED AND
[1:17:03] SMOKING. AMEN. A BUNCH OF ADULTERERS FOR
[1:17:05] PREACHERS PREACHING TRINITARIANISM. AND
[1:17:08] THEY CAN SHOUT AND REJOICE. WHAT ABOUT
[1:17:11] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST THAT HAS BEEN
[1:17:14] GIVEN THE SPOKEN WORD, THE REDEMPTIVE
[1:17:16] POWERS IN THE AGE? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT
[1:17:19] IS. We're worshiping Jesus.
[1:17:22] WE'RE NOT JUST WORSHIPING SOME FIGMENT
[1:17:25] OF SOME IMAGINATION. WE ARE WORSHIPING
[1:17:27] OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; in the power of his glory AND THE POWER
[1:17:34] OF HIS SALVATION.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; They said, "Wow, it's getting awful
[1:17:38] noisy." Brother said, "If it's not a
[1:17:39] little noisy, it's a sign you're dead."
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; And he ties that to the scripture and
[1:17:47] said, "When Aaron quit making noise
[1:17:49] behind the Holies of Holies, they had to
[1:17:51] drag him out cuz they knew he had died
[1:17:54] in the presence of God." Well, I don't
[1:17:56] want nobody dragging me out of the
[1:17:57] presence of God for a lack, amen, of
[1:18:00] worship in my life.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; People get noisy. It's enough to make
[1:18:06] them noisy.
[1:18:08] He said, "I like a little noise."
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:18:14] it's going while you're making the
[1:18:16] noise.
[1:18:17] Now, now
[1:18:20] Jesus coming into the earth, I want you
[1:18:22] to watch this.
[1:18:24] When he comes into the earth,
[1:18:28] the angels show up.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; The angels themselves. Brother Bam goes
[1:18:35] through a great drama of how they were
[1:18:37] they were peeking over.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; What's it going to look like?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Because they've they've been worshiping
[1:18:44] this this creation, this creator.
[1:18:46] They've been worshiping God, but now he
[1:18:48] was taking human form and they're
[1:18:50] they're peeking over the corridors
[1:18:52] knowing that God is coming into that
[1:18:54] human body. Amen. And they gathered into
[1:18:57] the earth and gathered the shepherds up.
[1:18:59] Amen. Brother Wy had to be shepherds.
[1:19:00] Amen. They gathered the shepherds up and
[1:19:02] angels begin to sing. Amen. At the birth
[1:19:06] of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WAS A FEW DAYS LATER, EIGHT
[1:19:11] DAYS LATER, CHRISTOPHER, THEY CARRIED
[1:19:12] THIS INFANT CHILD WHO HAS DONE NOTHING
[1:19:16] BUT BE BORN.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; EIGHT DAYS LATER, THEY BRING HIM IN AND
[1:19:19] THE TURTLE dove and and pigeon is their
[1:19:22] offering BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO POOR FOR A
[1:19:24] LAMB.
[1:19:27] EIGHT DAYS LATER, THIS OLD MAN SIMEON IS
[1:19:30] BACK THERE PRAYING AND GOD HAS BEEN
[1:19:32] TELLING HIM, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE OF
[1:19:34] OLD AGE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE LORD'S
[1:19:35] CHRIST." AND ON THAT MORNING, he got up
[1:19:38] and come. And brother Bam SAID HE WALKED
[1:19:40] RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THAT LINE of women
[1:19:42] holding them babies, waiting on their
[1:19:44] dedications. He said to that man, "Come
[1:19:46] right to Jesus." AND BROTHER, YOU talk
[1:19:48] about worship, the worship of a baby. HE
[1:19:51] HELD THAT CHILD UP AND BEGAN TO SAY,
[1:19:54] "THIS IS THE LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES.
[1:19:57] THIS IS UNTO THEM WHOM THEY'RE GOING TO
[1:19:59] TRUST." AND JUST ABOUT THE TIME ABOUT I
[1:20:02] bet Mary was having a fit. Can you
[1:20:04] imagine, Megan? You bring your kid for
[1:20:05] dedication and an old man rush and grabs
[1:20:07] it and puts it up into the heavens and
[1:20:09] said, "This is the light of the
[1:20:11] Gentiles." And she began to think
[1:20:13] herself, "Amen. Amen. Amen. That what
[1:20:15] that angel said and what happened to me,
[1:20:17] God's revealing to other people." And
[1:20:20] all OF A SUDDEN, ANNA, A BLIND WOMAN,
[1:20:23] AMEN, COMES RUNNING DOWN THERE AND FINDS
[1:20:25] THAT BABY 8 DAYS OLD AND BEGINS TO
[1:20:28] PROPHESY OVER THE CHILD AND LETS THEM
[1:20:30] KNOW THAT THIS IS THEM. THIS IS THE
[1:20:32] CHRIST. THIS IS THE ONE THEY'VE been
[1:20:33] looking for. Amen. It happens, folks.
[1:20:36] From the very birth of Jesus, creation
[1:20:38] began to testify of who he was. Watch
[1:20:41] what happens. The magis, brother said,
[1:20:43] is two years over on the other side in
[1:20:45] India. And he said, "The angel of the
[1:20:48] Lord," I love that quote. Hebrews
[1:20:50] series, "The angel of the Lord came down
[1:20:54] and appeared to them as a star and led
[1:20:57] them to him."
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And by the time they got there, he'd
[1:21:01] done been moving around, Kimberly. He'd
[1:21:03] done, Sister Kimberly, and they've been
[1:21:05] done moving him around, but that pillar
[1:21:07] fire knew right where the present truth
[1:21:09] was.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; And it led him to the house. The Bible
[1:21:13] said LED HIM TO THE HOUSE. and the Magi.
[1:21:15] Can you IMAGINE MARY AND JOSEPH and them
[1:21:17] AND THEY'RE IN THERE AND AND I DON'T
[1:21:19] KNOW WHAT HOUSE they're staying at, but
[1:21:21] they get a knock at THE DOOR AND
[1:21:22] SOMEBODY SAYS AND Joseph said, "Mary,
[1:21:23] come here. Come here. There's some
[1:21:25] important people out here. They got they
[1:21:27] got camels full. That looks like gold
[1:21:28] and frankincense and my and the magi
[1:21:32] tell us where you laid him." CAN YOU
[1:21:35] IMAGINE WHEN THEY STARTED unl
[1:21:37] the loads of gold and frankincense and
[1:21:41] myrr and starts anointing AND GIFTING
[1:21:43] THIS CHILD BECAUSE HE IS THE KING AND
[1:21:46] THEY HAVE SAW HIS SIGN AND THE BIBLE
[1:21:49] SAID AND THEY CAME TO worship him.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; OH A 2YEAR-OLD CHILD AND HERE THEY CAME
[1:21:57] TO WORSHIP HIM. HE WAS WORSHIPED IN THE
[1:22:00] HEAVENS AND NOW HE'S BEING WORSHIPED IN
[1:22:03] THE EARTH. NOW, HE'S BEEN TAKEN OFF OF
[1:22:05] THE EARTH AND SAT IN THE THRONE OF GOD.
[1:22:07] AND WE STILL WORSHIP HIM THIS MORNING
[1:22:10] BECAUSE HE IS NO OTHER THAN GOD.
[1:22:14] HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:16] HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; I I got I got a lot of scriptures on
[1:22:21] worship. I'm not going I'm not going to
[1:22:22] get them all to you.
[1:22:25] What you see is is you see a continuity
[1:22:28] is you see a continuity of these people
[1:22:32] moving toward him and his presence being
[1:22:35] recognized in the earth causes
[1:22:38] worship out of man. Do you know man is
[1:22:42] designed to worship God?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; That's why when brother said when they
[1:22:47] come here the Indians were worshiping
[1:22:49] the sun and they were worshiping the
[1:22:50] waters and the winds. He said, "You you
[1:22:53] you I've been to India. I watch you.
[1:22:55] They they go over and carve some little
[1:22:57] you you've seen them. They they carve
[1:22:59] little carvings and and I went to Mater,
[1:23:02] the greatest temple, the Hindu temple. I
[1:23:03] went right in the temple, been right
[1:23:05] there. And they have got stacks of gods
[1:23:07] about this tall. There's there's maybe
[1:23:08] 100,000 of them across the top of that.
[1:23:10] And they carved them with their own
[1:23:12] hands
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; because they're so thirsty to worship
[1:23:15] something. But all they can worship is
[1:23:18] something they have designed with their
[1:23:20] own hands because they don't know that
[1:23:23] the God of heaven come down and took an
[1:23:25] image that they might worship him in the
[1:23:27] image of his son. But they worship them
[1:23:30] things. And brother Bam says it. See,
[1:23:32] see even in worship, even in a perverted
[1:23:34] worship, look how noisy they get.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Look at that. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Worshiping the God of heaven and they
[1:23:42] think they're worshiping God while
[1:23:44] worshiping a idol or worshiping this or
[1:23:47] that because they're designed for
[1:23:49] worship.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Now, now now this is now folks. I'm not
[1:23:53] against uh I'm not against quiet people.
[1:23:55] So you y'all have to be careful. It it
[1:23:57] uh is it I I don't want to say anything
[1:24:00] about anybody, but you know, I I've I've
[1:24:02] often seen uh that God God develops
[1:24:05] characters and he designs and worship is
[1:24:07] in your own dictates. So, don't take
[1:24:09] this sermon as I'm beating you up for
[1:24:10] being quiet.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Actually, just realize this that we got
[1:24:14] some loud people and it seems like
[1:24:16] everybody beats up our loud people for
[1:24:17] worshiping.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And I really am really disturbed by
[1:24:21] that.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:24:23] I can take it and somebody gets a
[1:24:24] scripture wrong, but you you start
[1:24:26] preaching against people worshiping God
[1:24:28] and you got a real problem with me.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you can read. If you can
[1:24:35] worship God, worship him. That's right.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; So now we we have we have so watered
[1:24:44] down the gospel of Jesus Christ that now
[1:24:47] salvation and the great miracles of God
[1:24:50] just come and shake my hand or come and
[1:24:51] hear me speak.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; That's what it's been reduced to.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; It isn't it? It it I read I read a
[1:25:00] prophet. Y'all y'all have to forgive me
[1:25:02] because I told my wife one time and I'm
[1:25:05] probably getting too open here, but I
[1:25:07] told my wife one time, I said I I I
[1:25:10] think I was a better listener of
[1:25:12] ministry before I before I listen to
[1:25:15] brother Brandham
[1:25:17] because now I listen to brother Brandham
[1:25:19] so much. I know when someone's taking
[1:25:21] and hijacking his quotes to take it a
[1:25:23] direction they want.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Because I I I'm different in listen and
[1:25:27] I think this would be good for you.
[1:25:30] Don't just take a quote of a prophet,
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Listen to the tape.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Listen to what William Brandham
[1:25:42] believed.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; See, he said, listen, I will stand
[1:25:49] someday in the judgment and I will have
[1:25:50] to answer, but I will never answer to a
[1:25:53] creed. So help me God, I will answer to
[1:25:56] this Bible, and this is the book I stand
[1:25:58] by. There is no place in this Bible
[1:26:01] where they ever receive the Holy Ghost
[1:26:03] without without having emotions
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; speaking with tongues or shouting or
[1:26:09] praising God or prophecies or
[1:26:10] manifestations. They never did just walk
[1:26:13] up and shake hands with a preacher and
[1:26:15] walk away.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And there is no place in the Bible they
[1:26:21] ever did receive or was baptized outside
[1:26:24] of being baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:26:26] Christ. And there was no place in the
[1:26:28] Bible it ever taught trinity. It taught
[1:26:31] one God. Amen. Do do you see what a
[1:26:33] prophet is saying? He's not answering to
[1:26:35] man's creeds. WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; WATCH. BROTHER BRAM SAYS IT LIKE THIS.
[1:26:40] HE SAID, WATCH WHAT PAUL WAS SAYING.
[1:26:42] HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, FUNDAMENTAL.
[1:26:44] He says, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS but
[1:26:47] denying the power of it
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; from such turn away.
[1:26:54] AMEN.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S THAT'S powerful to me,
[1:26:57] folks.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; I Some people sit and listen to nonsense
[1:27:00] till they can't even hardly get liberty
[1:27:02] in church.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody's somebody's wicked words weigh
[1:27:07] so heavy on their minds that they can't
[1:27:09] even get liberty anymore. I tell you
[1:27:11] what you ought to do is turn off that
[1:27:12] nonsense and start listening to the word
[1:27:14] of God.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; A prophet OF THIS AGE WAS SENT to bring
[1:27:18] liberty to you. He'd come to give
[1:27:20] liberty to this church of the living
[1:27:21] God. Listen, I I I tell you, I'm reading
[1:27:24] a prophet right here. He said, "FROM
[1:27:26] SUCH, TURN AWAY." And I did, and I
[1:27:29] become a holy roller. Hallelujah. And
[1:27:31] when THE WIND GOES TO BLOWING, I get
[1:27:33] into it and say, "Yes, Lord. I believe
[1:27:36] you're the same yesterday and forever."
[1:27:37] YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IN the
[1:27:39] sermon, why I am a holy roller. How many
[1:27:41] ever heard it?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Why I am a holy roller? He said, "You
[1:27:44] can't just start in the middle. You got
[1:27:47] to go back back and find out what's
[1:27:48] going on."
[1:27:50] in him. Brother Brandham took why I'm a
[1:27:52] holy roller and went to the book of
[1:27:53] Genesis and divided the worship between
[1:27:56] Cain and Abel and brought two vines out
[1:27:58] of Genesis and he BROUGHT THE FROM
[1:28:00] GENESIS of Cain and Abel. He then he
[1:28:03] brings them to Moses and Balum. AND HE
[1:28:05] SAID THERE'S TWO VINES THERE. THERE'S
[1:28:07] THE FUNDAMENTAL AND there's the
[1:28:09] spiritual. AND BROTHER BRANDON WAS VERY
[1:28:11] CLEAR. HE SAID BALUM AND MOSES HAD THE
[1:28:15] SAME FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES. HE SAID,
[1:28:18] "BUT ONE OF THEM DIDN'T HAVE THE
[1:28:20] SUPERNATURAL AMONG THEM." OH, church of
[1:28:23] the living God. Amen. Listen, you can be
[1:28:25] as fundamental AS YOU WANT TO, BUT WHEN
[1:28:27] YOU THROW THE HOLY GHOST OUT, LOOK AT
[1:28:29] WHAT YOU'VE GOT. YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING
[1:28:31] BUT A BAIL AND BALUM ASSEMBLY THAT IS
[1:28:34] REFUSING THE MOVING OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:28:37] AMEN. AND BY THE GRACE OF GOD, AMEN.
[1:28:40] WE'LL MAKE ROOM FOR IT IN TRUE EARTH
[1:28:42] TABERNACLE. WE'LL MAKE ROOM FOR THE HOLY
[1:28:45] GHOST TO COME INTO THE CHURCH OF THE
[1:28:46] LIVING GOD.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; NOW, if you want to if you want to take
[1:28:51] it, I I'd say, Brother Bam, don't end it
[1:28:53] there. He carries it over to his own
[1:28:55] experience and carries it over to the
[1:28:57] standing up on the mountain. How many
[1:28:58] ever heard him tell it? And he said, "I
[1:29:00] found myself in that dead forest." And
[1:29:02] he said, "Them big tall trees that once
[1:29:04] stood there so saintly." He said, "And
[1:29:06] the wind blew through them." He said,
[1:29:08] "But when the wind hit them, they said
[1:29:10] days of miracles had passed.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in that Holy Ghost no
[1:29:15] more." He, that's what he, Brother Bam,
[1:29:18] actually says, "The trees responded to
[1:29:20] the wind." And the way they responded
[1:29:23] was they felt the wind, but they rebuked
[1:29:26] the wind by saying, "I don't believe it.
[1:29:27] That's not from God. That's not that
[1:29:29] way." He said, "But then," he said, "I
[1:29:31] almost gave up on the idea." He said,
[1:29:34] "But then I looked down and saw them
[1:29:35] little trees coming up among them." And
[1:29:38] he said, "And when the wind started
[1:29:39] blowing," he said, "them little fellas,"
[1:29:41] he said, "they were so flexible." He
[1:29:43] said, "They just moved under that." Now,
[1:29:45] Brother Bam says, "Watch this now. Same
[1:29:47] trees."
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; See what he does? Fundamental. Moses and
[1:29:52] Balum, same trees. Men are called trees
[1:29:55] in the Bible. Same kind of trees. THEY
[1:29:58] WERE BOTH THE same trees,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; BUT ONE WAS LIVING AND ONE WAS DEAD. ONE
[1:30:05] WAS FLEXIBLE AND ONE WAS UNMOVING. I
[1:30:08] SAY, GOD, LET A REVIVAL SWEEP INTO OUR
[1:30:11] GENERATION SINCE THAT'S COMING ON.
[1:30:13] LISTEN, WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE HAD A GREAT
[1:30:15] REVIVAL. BROTHER brother brother
[1:30:19] A and I Amen. We've shouted our heels
[1:30:21] off. First time I ever met him, Amen.
[1:30:23] was well I think we'd preach maybe one
[1:30:25] or two times and you had me stay the
[1:30:27] night with you down there and I remember
[1:30:28] coming out of the upstairs and it was
[1:30:30] late in the night and I heard a little
[1:30:31] something so I come off the upstairs and
[1:30:33] when I come down I looked over there in
[1:30:35] the corner and brother Ray was up on the
[1:30:36] prayer meeting there and he was speaking
[1:30:38] in the other known tongue and and man he
[1:30:40] was just having himself a prayer meeting
[1:30:42] well I tell you what I didn't do I
[1:30:43] didn't turn around and run back up the
[1:30:45] room say I can't believe there's a
[1:30:46] tongue talker in this house I went down
[1:30:48] there and put my arm around him and the
[1:30:50] next thing you know I was talking in
[1:30:52] tongues with him. Amen. And and that's
[1:30:54] when we really fell in love. I I fell in
[1:30:56] love with a man. I said, "This guy right
[1:30:58] here, he's met the same kind of God I
[1:31:00] met." And I COME TO THIS TABERNACLE AND
[1:31:03] I REMEMBER THE ATMOSPHERE AND HOW THE
[1:31:06] BROTHER BEN OR BROTHER BRIAN, ONE OF
[1:31:07] THEM WOULD START LEADING SONGS AND THE
[1:31:09] SPIRIT OF GOD WOULD START MOVING AND THE
[1:31:11] POWER OF GOD, THE ATMOSPHERE EVEN BEFORE
[1:31:14] THE WORD WAS EVER SPOKEN, CREATING A
[1:31:16] PLACE AND AND THE POWER WAS THERE. AMEN.
[1:31:18] AND I SAY, GOD, DON'T NEVER DON'T LET IT
[1:31:21] DIE. DON'T NEVER LET THAT REVIVAL GO OUT
[1:31:24] OF OUR MIDST. AMEN. LISTEN, FOLKS. STAY
[1:31:27] ALIVE. STAY ALIVE IN THE POWER OF GOD. I
[1:31:30] DON'T CARE WHAT THESE BUNCH OF DOCTORS
[1:31:32] OF DIVINITIES HAS TO SAY. THE POWER OF
[1:31:35] GOD IS JUST AS REAL THIS MORNING AS IT
[1:31:38] EVER WAS. WE NEED A NEW BIRTH LIKE WE
[1:31:41] ALWAYS NEEDED NEW BIRTH. WE NEED
[1:31:43] experiences from God just like we always
[1:31:46] did. Why do they call William Brandham a
[1:31:49] holy roller? Well, I tell you what.
[1:31:51] Amen. They called him a holy roller cuz
[1:31:53] HE GOT AMONG THAT CROWD that shouted and
[1:31:56] spoke with tongues and believed in
[1:31:58] prayer and believed in miracles AND
[1:32:00] BELIEVED IN SUPERNATURALS. THEY
[1:32:02] LITERALLY COULD FEEL THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:32:04] BROTHER MAN SAID, "I'M GLAD I'M
[1:32:06] ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE THAT CAN FEEL THE
[1:32:09] SPIRIT OF GOD."
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YEAH.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; And and so so because you preach this
[1:32:19] way, then there's somebody that says,
[1:32:20] "Well, Brother Wayne, because I'm quiet,
[1:32:22] do you think I'm out of out of place?" I
[1:32:24] don't know if y'all have ever noticed,
[1:32:25] my wife is not the loudest person in our
[1:32:27] church.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; But I'll say this, she's one of the most
[1:32:31] spiritual people in this church. I live
[1:32:34] with her and I know I've never seen a
[1:32:36] more solid spiritual person and loves to
[1:32:39] see the spirit of God move. She asked to
[1:32:43] be in that prayer line. She asked for
[1:32:44] the job up there up top cuz she said, "I
[1:32:47] want to see God moving on them young
[1:32:48] people. I want to watch the presence of
[1:32:50] God as it baptizes them and as it move
[1:32:53] them." There's nothing denying. Amen.
[1:32:55] You just because somebody's quiet don't
[1:32:56] mean they deny the moving of the spirit.
[1:32:59] Amen. It's that old nasty spirit. YOU
[1:33:01] KNOW THAT OLD NASTY SPIRIT that gets on
[1:33:03] PEOPLE AND THEY START TALKING BAD ABOUT
[1:33:05] the moving of God and the prayer lines
[1:33:07] and the moving of the spirit and WHAT IT
[1:33:09] IS. AND AIN'T NOTHING BUT AN UNBELIEVING
[1:33:11] DEVIL AND COME OUT OF THE PITS OF HELL.
[1:33:14] AND I REBUKE IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:33:16] CHRIST. WE WILL HAVE LIBERTY IN THE
[1:33:19] HOUSE OF GOD. WE INVITE THE PRESENCE OF
[1:33:22] GOD. WE INVITE THE TRUTH OF GOD.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH. CALL ME A HOLY ROLLER
[1:33:30] IF YOU WANT TO.
[1:33:32] BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS HOLY ROLLER
[1:33:34] IS GOING TO BE IN A RAPTURE.
[1:33:38] BETHANY, I'M JUST WARMING UP FOR that
[1:33:40] meeting.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT it is. SOMEBODY
[1:33:43] SAID, "WELL, WELL, WHY DOES PEOPLE TALK
[1:33:46] SO bad about why why does people talk so
[1:33:48] bad?" Do y'all know why? Y'all know what
[1:33:49] really is? It's taking the worship away
[1:33:51] from Jesus Christ.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know? And how many was here when
[1:33:59] I taught in the book of Revelations and
[1:34:00] I went through Revelations 13,
[1:34:02] Revelation 17, that Rome trip we took,
[1:34:04] brother Seth?
[1:34:05] And remember I broke down that the that
[1:34:08] from 303 they made uh Christianity
[1:34:10] illegal and the pagans crucified and
[1:34:14] killed Christians for 10 years.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; 303 to 313.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; But in 313
[1:34:19] then Constantine made Christianity
[1:34:22] legal.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Right? But in 3:25 they had Nika
[1:34:26] council. And then in IA council they
[1:34:28] forbid anyone to to to worship outside
[1:34:33] of that Catholic trinitarian doctrine
[1:34:35] that they formed of trinitarianism.
[1:34:38] And they begin to label anybody that
[1:34:41] didn't get under their idea as a
[1:34:44] heretic.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's what they did. They said, "You're
[1:34:47] a heretic." And then in 380 in the edict
[1:34:49] of Thessanica, they then made a law that
[1:34:53] if you wasn't baptized under
[1:34:54] Trinitarianism that they could kill you
[1:34:56] for it.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to label you a heretic and
[1:35:01] then I'm going to KILL YOU FOR YOUR
[1:35:02] HERESY.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Now they're doing the same thing
[1:35:05] spiritually today.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; They folks GET TOGETHER AND DECIDE HOW
[1:35:09] THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED to worship and how
[1:35:11] we're supposed to do this and how we're
[1:35:12] DOING THAT. AND WE ARE DOING IT EXACTLY
[1:35:14] LIKE A PROPHET taught it. That's right.
[1:35:17] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; BUT IF ONE CAN LABEL YOU A HERETIC, THEN
[1:35:21] they can murder the influence of your
[1:35:23] ministry OR OF YOUR CHURCH AND THEY
[1:35:26] MURDER ANYTHING THAT'S NOT FIT IN THEIR
[1:35:28] LITTLE BOX THAT THEY'VE GOT SET ASIDE
[1:35:30] FOR RELIGION. WELL, I TELL YOU THIS, YOU
[1:35:32] CAN PERSECUTE HER. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT
[1:35:34] HER. YOU CAN THROW THINGS AT HER, BUT
[1:35:36] YOU'LL NEVER STOP HER. THIS CHURCH OF
[1:35:38] THE LIVING GOD IS GOING TO WORSHIP GOD
[1:35:41] IN THE PRESENCE, AND PAUL SAID, "THE WAY
[1:35:43] YOU CALL HERESY
[1:35:46] IS THE WAY I WORSHIP THE GOD OF OUR
[1:35:48] FATHERS. BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I WORSHIP
[1:35:51] JESUS CHRIST, I AM NOT WORSHIPING JUST A
[1:35:53] HEBREW. I'M NOT WORSHIPING A JEW OR JUST
[1:35:56] A MAN. BUT THAT WAS GOD COMING INTO THAT
[1:35:59] MAN. NOW HE'S ASCENDED ON HIGH AND SENT
[1:36:02] BACK THE HOLY GHOST. SO IS THAT YOU AND
[1:36:04] I COULD SIT HERE IN THIS CHURCH THIS
[1:36:06] MORNING. AND WHEN WE FEEL THAT PRESENCE
[1:36:08] OF GOD COMING INTO THIS ROOM, WE KNOW
[1:36:12] THAT HIS PRESENCE MAKING KNOWN TO YOU
[1:36:15] AND I THAT HE'S HERE WITH US. AND I'LL
[1:36:17] tell you this, when he begins to move, I
[1:36:19] believe the church are to open up their
[1:36:21] hearts, they are to say, "LORD, THIS IS
[1:36:24] YOUR CHURCH. This is your house. We have
[1:36:26] invited you to come and Lord, we're
[1:36:28] going to welcome you."
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this scripture
[1:36:33] right here. I want to show you what
[1:36:34] Brother Bam titles it in Psalms chapter.
[1:36:36] I was going to close anyhow, but he put
[1:36:38] it back on my heart. In Psalms 2:12, I
[1:36:40] want you to watch this. We just quoted
[1:36:42] Psalms 2 earlier, but 2:12, I want you
[1:36:44] to watch this scripture. Kiss the son
[1:36:47] lest he be angry and perish from the way
[1:36:51] when his wrath is kindled up a little
[1:36:52] bit. Kiss the son. That's an Old
[1:36:55] Testament prophecy that when God sends
[1:36:58] his son, begotten son, that they were to
[1:37:01] kiss him.
[1:37:03] And brother Brandham takes this
[1:37:04] scripture to tell you what was wrong at
[1:37:08] Simon Pharisees house.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And he said when Jesus come in the door,
[1:37:13] he said they never kissed him.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; They they rejected
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; they rejected him. Brother Bam said
[1:37:21] there it is. I imagine he was miserable
[1:37:24] sitting there. The Pharisees testing
[1:37:26] over testifying over there about
[1:37:28] different things. And poor Jesus sat
[1:37:30] there with dirty feet, an unaned face,
[1:37:33] no kiss. Jesus wants to be kissed.
[1:37:37] There's a scripture in Psalms 2 said,
[1:37:38] "Kiss the son." You'll never know what
[1:37:41] it means to once you've kissed him. Kiss
[1:37:44] that son and make him welcome in your
[1:37:46] heart.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it like this. He said
[1:37:50] they sat there. He said, you said, one
[1:37:53] of them says, "Well, I got a PhD and I
[1:37:55] don't care what you got. If you got a
[1:37:57] stony heart, you better worship him
[1:37:58] while you can.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Kiss the son while you can. That's
[1:38:02] right.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Unless he be angry.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; I think it's I think I think we
[1:38:09] can kiss the sun. You How do I do that
[1:38:12] today? Open up your heart
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; and know when you're worshiping.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; This is not this is not fanaticism.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; This is not somebody worshiping creed.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; This is not some man-made doctrine.
[1:38:26] This is God
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; in his present truth. Could you stand
[1:38:29] with me this morning
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; worship?
[1:38:45] There's a lot on it.
[1:38:50] God
[1:38:52] created
[1:38:54] worship
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; because God loves
[1:39:01] God loves
[1:39:03] worship.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; I just sat there and thought about it
[1:39:06] this morning. I I was just sitting
[1:39:08] thinking,
[1:39:10] where did worship even come from?
[1:39:14] God
[1:39:16] loves worship.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; God created angels to worship
[1:39:25] and he put something within man
[1:39:28] to worship.
[1:39:30] But gave you never seen no cat build a
[1:39:32] church.
[1:39:34] There's no dogs. There's no dogs ever
[1:39:36] went out there and piled up some stones,
[1:39:41] knelt down and prayed. But there's
[1:39:43] something about a man.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Even on a lonely mountain,
[1:39:50] Abraham built an altar. Who taught him
[1:39:53] how to build that altar?
[1:39:57] You ever think about it?
[1:40:00] But something within the man.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Something wanted to worship.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; He wanted to worship God.
[1:40:11] There's something within your hearts.
[1:40:13] That's why you It's why you do and why
[1:40:15] you come and why you give and why you
[1:40:17] put your days aside and say
[1:40:20] there's something in you want to worship
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; something want you I want to worship
[1:40:25] God.
[1:40:27] Sometimes
[1:40:30] sometimes that that that's just a
[1:40:34] sometimes believe how that's just a
[1:40:36] secret place in your home, you know,
[1:40:37] where you you move something out and you
[1:40:39] just get on your knees there.
[1:40:43] There's something about that, isn't it?
[1:40:45] Bowing your knee.
[1:40:48] There's something there's something
[1:40:49] about that because that was the thing
[1:40:52] the Hebrew children refused.
[1:40:56] They refused
[1:40:58] to bow their knee to another God.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you pray for me and you
[1:41:04] say, "God, why is our pastor so so
[1:41:08] rough?" He He about bowing to other
[1:41:11] men's teachings on worship. Why is he
[1:41:13] all right?
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Look back at my inheritance. Look, look
[1:41:16] back at my heritage
[1:41:19] and see if every man of God that ever
[1:41:22] lived refused to bow his knee
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; to another God.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Do y'all Do y'all recognize that worship
[1:41:33] is hearing the word as well?
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Do you know Satan
[1:41:39] displaced
[1:41:41] God from Eve and became Eve's God?
[1:41:46] because she listened to one word.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Careful what you listen to, folks.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; It ain't because your pastor's going to
[1:41:55] get on to you. Don't you displace the
[1:41:56] God of Abraham
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; and allow some other some other thought
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; or some other being to extract your
[1:42:05] worship that belongs to him.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; There's something in you. There's
[1:42:10] something in you that wants to worship
[1:42:12] God.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he made a way
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; that you could worship him.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; He's anointed us to be here in this
[1:42:21] assembly.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; When I took the pastorship, I got
[1:42:25] somewhere privately and I told the Lord,
[1:42:27] "Lord, I'll do this,
[1:42:30] but only if you promise to be with me.
[1:42:34] And if you promise to be here with me, I
[1:42:36] promise to keep the channel open for you
[1:42:39] to move within your people." Praise.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you this morning, I'm not
[1:42:44] ever going to get in your way.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; So if something else is in your way this
[1:42:48] morning from worship him, want you just
[1:42:50] lay it aside right now.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; If there's something in your mind, some
[1:42:54] feeling, some situation, and it's taking
[1:42:57] the glory and the worship away from my
[1:42:59] Lord Jesus, want you to set it aside
[1:43:00] this morning. Say, "Lord, I repent. I
[1:43:03] want to worship you.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I want to worship you with all my
[1:43:06] heart."
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ben, you got something?
[1:43:10] I want to worship you more.
[1:43:14] We are
[1:43:16] a moment.
[1:43:20] You are
[1:43:23] forever.
