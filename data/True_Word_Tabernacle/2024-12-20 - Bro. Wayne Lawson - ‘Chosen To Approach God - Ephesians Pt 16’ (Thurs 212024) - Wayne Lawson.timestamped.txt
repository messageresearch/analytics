[4:27] certainly an honor to be here in the

[4:37] to the right places and Lord as we come
[4:40] together tonight as a children we come
[4:42] to worship
[4:43] you and Lord truly we do not come to the
[4:46] unknown
[4:48] God lord though you're

[4:53] this age than that we can see you by

[5:12] word oh God we pray in the name of the
[5:15] Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things
[5:18] amen am and amen God bless you tonight
[5:22] if you have your Bibles we'd like to go
[5:24] into the book of Ephesians I'd go in
[5:26] Ephesians chapter 2 and I'd like to read
[5:29] from the 11 the verse down to the 18th
[5:31] verse
[5:33] um I'm taking a little bigger bite on
[5:36] these scriptures uh some of these I'm
[5:38] taking a long time in maybe one section
[5:40] and then I'm adding because the way Paul
[5:43] writes this some of these scriptures are
[5:45] saying the same thing again and again
[5:47] just a little different way so U I want
[5:49] to include uh these few verses together
[5:53] amen 11 down to
[5:55] 18 wherefore remember that ye being in
[5:58] times past Gentiles In the Flesh who are
[6:02] called
[6:03] uncircumcised
[6:05] uncircumcision by that which is called
[6:08] the circumcision in the flesh made by
[6:11] hands that at the time you were without
[6:15] Christ being aliens from the common
[6:18] wealth of Israel and strangers from the
[6:21] covenants of his promise having no hope
[6:24] without God in the world but now in
[6:27] Christ Jesus ye who sometimes or far off
[6:31] are made nigh by the blood of Christ for
[6:33] he is our
[6:34] peace who have made both one and hath
[6:38] broken down the middle wall of partition
[6:41] between us having abolished in his flesh
[6:44] the enmity when the even the law the
[6:46] Commandments contained in the ordinances
[6:47] for to make himself Twain one new man so
[6:51] making peace that he might reconcile
[6:54] both unto God and one body by the cross
[6:56] having slain the enity thereby and came
[7:00] and preached peace to you which were a
[7:02] far off and to them that were n for
[7:06] through him we both have access by one
[7:10] Spirit unto the father we ask the Lord
[7:14] to bless his word as you could be seated
[7:16] tonight I want to take that and for a
[7:19] context I'd like to speak to you on
[7:21] chosen to approach God chosen to
[7:26] approach
[7:27] God as we read this here in the book of
[7:30] Ephesians it's an it's an amazing thing
[7:33] of how Paul in Ephesians chapter 2 has
[7:35] began aen with you who were quickened
[7:38] and then he speaks of God rich in Mercy
[7:41] and he tells you that ye that were dead
[7:44] and sins and trespasses and now he's
[7:46] remembering and reminding you amen that
[7:49] there was a time that you were without
[7:51] Christ now who he's speaking to is
[7:53] Ephesians he's speaking to this Ephesian
[7:55] church people that are in Christ and
[7:58] he's trying to Clare to them what kind
[8:00] of real change has happened in their
[8:02] life what what what Christ has done for
[8:05] them they're experiencing uh they're
[8:07] they're already in it now he's talking
[8:09] to them about what's been done for them
[8:11] and he he says here that remember now ye
[8:14] and times past Gentiles In the Flesh so
[8:18] he's making sure you understand he's
[8:20] speaking to them that were outside the
[8:22] Covenant as Gentiles who were called
[8:25] uncircumcision by them which were
[8:27] circumcised amen and that the time that
[8:31] you were without Christ see not only
[8:34] were we not Christians now it's this is
[8:37] a this is amazing Paul speaking this to
[8:40] these people because he's living in a
[8:41] time that is just when the Gentile
[8:44] church is coming in that when the
[8:46] gentile people are just being received
[8:48] into the into the promises of God and
[8:51] not only we were not Christians but we
[8:53] had no knowledge of Christ or the
[8:55] Messiah see there was no title to the
[8:58] blessings that was would proceed from
[9:00] him so he's speaking to people who are
[9:02] now under the blessing from Ephesians 1
[9:05] they've been seated in Heavenly places
[9:07] and now he's telling them you were
[9:09] quickened who were even dead in sin and
[9:12] he's saying there was a time that you
[9:14] were without Christ but here's a little
[9:16] deeper meaning than this they wasn't
[9:18] even expecting Christ there was not even
[9:22] a Prophecy of the Messiah to come to
[9:24] them and that's you remember when
[9:26] brother bandam talks about the woman at
[9:28] the well and he said Jesus went to the
[9:29] woman of the well and he performed the
[9:31] sign of the Messiah he said then he went
[9:33] again to Phillip and The Sign of the
[9:36] Messiah and he went to Peter and the son
[9:38] of Messiah and he said see he done it
[9:39] for both the Jew and the Samaritan
[9:42] because they were expecting a messiah he
[9:45] said but these gentile people had never
[9:47] had any promise of a messiah so they
[9:49] were not just without Christ they were
[9:52] without expectation of Christ they had
[9:54] no they had not even an expectation that
[9:57] Christ would come to them and they had
[9:58] no idle to the blessing they had no
[10:00] right to the blessings of God because
[10:03] Paul is making it known to you that you
[10:05] were aliens from the common wealth of
[10:07] Israel and you were by birth think of
[10:11] this idolatrous by your birth amen as a
[10:14] gentile amen not only were you not apart
[10:17] you were away from Christ without a
[10:20] promise of Christ without uh uh that
[10:22] even it was supposed to come to the
[10:24] Gentile race and then he says to them
[10:27] and then you didn't have any privilege
[10:29] in the the Jewish and the Jewish Nations
[10:31] now think of this because that they were
[10:33] strangers to the covenants of Israel
[10:35] when Paul calls them strangers and he's
[10:38] calling them aliens it's a very
[10:40] significant thing because of the Old
[10:42] Testament rules that he was calling them
[10:44] strangers having no part in the promises
[10:47] of God so they were not even in the
[10:49] Covenant at all they wern't considered
[10:51] in the Covenant because the Covenant
[10:53] that Paul was introducing to them was
[10:56] strictly made to the abrahamic seed that
[10:59] was who the promise was made it was not
[11:01] made to everyone it was made to Abraham
[11:04] and his seed after them and these
[11:06] Gentiles in this Ephesian church had no
[11:10] no rights at all under the abrahamic
[11:12] Covenant there was nothing there for
[11:14] them amen and it was so much in that
[11:16] they wasn't the seed they had no part of
[11:18] the covenants they had no part of what
[11:21] God done on the horb for the Israelites
[11:23] they had no part in the token or the
[11:25] Passover they knew nothing of the seven
[11:28] blessings of God through through the uh
[11:30] through the great feast they they didn't
[11:32] know any of these promises they wasn't
[11:34] blessed any one of these Amen in so far
[11:37] that Paul begins to say to them that
[11:39] they were without
[11:41] hope now if that wording ever would
[11:44] describe anybody it would describe you
[11:47] and I tonight that we were without hope
[11:50] Amen in other words that there was there
[11:53] was no hope and you say well brother
[11:55] Wayne without hope what does that mean
[11:57] it means there was no hope of a pardon
[11:58] of sin amen now there was no hope of
[12:02] this there was no hope of the
[12:04] Resurrection there was no hope of the
[12:06] blessings there was no hope of the
[12:08] covenants there was no hope listen what
[12:10] Paul is telling this Ephesian church is
[12:12] you were so far removed from God not
[12:15] just without God but you were strangers
[12:18] to God you were aliens to God you had no
[12:22] hope with God he's trying to make you
[12:24] understand that that what God has done
[12:27] for you is above your understanding in
[12:29] it's it's above what you could even
[12:31] desire or even think to desire because
[12:34] it was only God look what we was without
[12:36] hope look and it says without God in
[12:40] this world Amen without God in this
[12:42] world I I think that's that's powerful
[12:45] because as a gentile amen if you've ever
[12:47] traveled he was just down South America
[12:49] you ever traveled in the foreign
[12:50] countries you'll find there's a lot of
[12:52] and now it's coming back to America but
[12:54] there's a lot of gods in the Gentiles
[12:57] there's a lot of gods you go into the
[12:58] Pagan country countries and you can go
[12:59] over into the Asian countries and you
[13:01] find their buddh and you find all
[13:03] different types of Asian uh you can go
[13:06] into India you find the Hindu religions
[13:09] now and I will say something to you amen
[13:11] if you've never been there you you might
[13:13] not recognize it but many of the of the
[13:15] west of the Eastern religions of that
[13:17] Hinduism and things have crept their way
[13:19] into this America amen when the Eastern
[13:22] Indians start coming here lots of them
[13:24] are here now as doctors and and they're
[13:26] they here as a hotels and you know the
[13:29] hotels on all the hotels you know amen
[13:32] and and and you know all your gas
[13:34] stations and I love the Indian people
[13:36] I'm not trying to be amen matter of fact
[13:37] someone's probably watching right now
[13:39] but but but you find out that and they
[13:41] amen that's real strong amen but you'll
[13:44] find out that some of the things that
[13:45] are happening in America now actually
[13:48] has its roots in that Hindu
[13:50] religion amen with the burning of
[13:52] incense and things that's all from there
[13:54] all these you see these nose rings and
[13:56] you see these belly rings and you see
[13:58] all these different little tattoos and
[14:00] things that's all coming from the Hindu
[14:02] religion and it's moving right over into
[14:04] this world Amen look what's happening
[14:07] this Leia is going right back where it
[14:10] was before God got him out of this
[14:13] godforsaken world this America is
[14:16] returning right back to its paganism
[14:18] amen that God brought it out of to begin
[14:21] with see we were without hope without
[14:23] God Amen that's the worst state anybody
[14:26] could be in no hope and no God we were
[14:29] lost in this world Amen and but it was
[14:32] God who was rich in Mercy amen that
[14:35] reached out to you and I amen it's not
[14:37] that we didn't have Gods but we didn't
[14:39] know Elohim we didn't have we didn't
[14:41] have the self-existent god the only
[14:43] thing we could worship was agnostics or
[14:46] un unknown God can I say many people are
[14:49] practically atheists they say they're
[14:51] not but practically they're atheist in
[14:53] their practices in their life that's
[14:55] this what this lean is did brother
[14:57] manman said in the thinking man's filter
[15:00] he said when we come into this world you
[15:01] were born in sin and you didn't even
[15:04] come with a fighting
[15:06] chance that that's just good to he'll
[15:08] Bly preaching right there but you didn't
[15:10] have a Fighting Chance you know what
[15:11] that means it means you walked into the
[15:13] fight and you was whipped before you
[15:15] threw the punch you didn't have a
[15:17] fighting chance when you were born in
[15:20] this world you didn't have a fighting
[15:22] chance but God put something in you that
[15:25] made you desire God when you without
[15:27] hope you without God you were lost in
[15:30] darkness but something in you said
[15:32] there's a God somewhere and I got to
[15:35] find him I got to know where he's at you
[15:37] never desired God but God desired you
[15:40] there was something in you you went to
[15:42] this church and that church and
[15:44] somewhere else but you didn't even have
[15:46] a chance amen because you were lost in
[15:48] this world but God Amen gave you Mercy
[15:52] that you might be able to find it
[15:53] because what the what the prophet is
[15:55] saying here amen I I think Paul is
[15:57] saying so powerfully amen without God in
[16:01] this world he said but now in Christ ye
[16:04] that were sometimes a far off were made
[16:07] nigh by the
[16:09] blood but ye that were far off how far
[16:12] off was I brother Wayne ye that were far
[16:14] off how far was you how far off was you
[16:18] without God lost in this world without
[16:22] hope as a commonwealth alien to the
[16:25] promises of God that's best way I know
[16:27] to say it that's how far you you were
[16:29] you were that far away amen and and and
[16:32] when you think about this you watch uh
[16:34] in in the prophet speaks of this in Acts
[16:36] chapter 2 from Exposition in church ages
[16:38] and he says uh as as they came to Peter
[16:41] and they said men and Brethren what can
[16:42] we do to be saved and Peter said unto
[16:44] them repent every one of you and be
[16:47] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[16:49] the remission of sins and you shall
[16:51] receive the gift of the Holy
[16:54] Ghost for this promis is unto you and
[16:58] unto your children and to all that are a
[17:01] far
[17:03] off even to as many as the Lord Our God
[17:06] shall call now isn't it powerful brother
[17:08] Ram says here it is and unto you Jews
[17:12] and unto your children Jews and to them
[17:15] that are a far off Gentiles and as many
[17:18] as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew
[17:20] and Gentile and as long as God is
[17:23] calling the Pentecostal message of power
[17:26] will never cease amen the Pentecost a
[17:29] message of power will never cease until
[17:31] God keeps quits calling but he has
[17:33] called us who are a far off amen the
[17:36] gentile people were a far off Our Roots
[17:39] were a far off our minds were a far off
[17:41] but God who was rich in Mercy called us
[17:44] Unto the Sons of adoption to give us the
[17:47] spirit of adoption and the Pentecostal
[17:49] blessing still exists for every man
[17:51] woman or child that God would call I
[17:54] don't care how far off they are if God's
[17:56] calling them he has a Pentecostal
[17:58] blessing that is left for them which is
[18:00] the only Vindication of the Resurrection
[18:03] that there is amen it is a Pentecostal
[18:06] blessing and the power of it will never
[18:08] cease it is the inalienable right to
[18:11] every believer that comes to God to
[18:13] receive the Holy Ghost I don't believe
[18:15] we are to take it away from our children
[18:17] I don't I don't believe it when this
[18:19] leosia has turned back into an Old
[18:22] Testament leysa brother said the Old
[18:24] Testament had Church ages and it ended
[18:26] with Le oysa and we find that this world
[18:29] is back in the same stage it was under
[18:32] the physical laws and the Sadducees and
[18:35] the traditions and the ideas and the
[18:38] Darkness of man and look how far away we
[18:41] were but God who rich in Mercy came to
[18:44] our lives amen and gave us a Pentecostal
[18:48] blessing my goodness isn't that powerful
[18:51] amen it's it's it's a powerful thing
[18:54] when he shows you how far off you were
[18:56] Paul's speaking to him now and said but
[18:58] you made nigh by
[19:02] Christ for he is our peace put it
[19:05] Ephesians chapter 2 and 14 up there for
[19:08] he is our peace who hath made both one
[19:13] hath broken down the middle wall of
[19:16] petition between us for he is our peace
[19:21] that he there is Christ yes sir the Lord
[19:24] Jesus Christ is our peace that word
[19:29] peace there is actually Shalom he is our
[19:34] Shalom he is our rest he is our mourning
[19:38] he is our peace he is our life he is our
[19:42] hope he is the rising of the sun he is
[19:45] the dawning of the day star Christ is
[19:48] our peace amen and I think it's powerful
[19:52] because the scripture tells us this in
[19:53] Isaiah 57 let's read three verses 19 20
[19:57] and 21 for I create the fruit of the
[19:59] lips peace peace to him that is far off
[20:03] and to him that is near saith the Lord I
[20:05] will heal him but the wicked are like
[20:08] the troubled
[20:09] sea when it cannot rest whose Waters
[20:12] cast up M and dirt there is no peace
[20:15] saith my God to the
[20:18] wicked there is no peace saith my God to
[20:21] the wicked do you know that's who you
[20:23] were when Isaiah was writing this
[20:26] scripture there is no peace to the
[20:27] wicked he's talking about the Gentile
[20:30] he's talking about the Heathen who had
[20:32] no sacrifice they had no blood covering
[20:35] they had no access to God they had no
[20:37] job that was they had no offering they
[20:40] had no peace they had no Grace they were
[20:42] the wicked outside the covenants of God
[20:44] brother said that's why God sent Jonah
[20:47] down to the Gentiles because they had no
[20:49] blood offerings they had no sin
[20:51] offerings they had nothing to offer to
[20:53] God they were lost and they were Wicked
[20:55] and there was no peace in the wicked do
[20:58] you know that doesn't change tonight
[21:00] without Christ there is no peace without
[21:03] Christ in a home there's no peace in a
[21:05] home without Christ in a church there's
[21:07] no peace in a church without Christ in a
[21:10] heart there's no peace in an individual
[21:12] that's the reason many homes are intermo
[21:15] and many churches are in turmo because
[21:17] the people in the home and the people in
[21:19] the church have never come to a peaceful
[21:22] experience with their maker almighty god
[21:25] listen I I I I I know this right now
[21:27] that Jesus him s the Bible predicted is
[21:30] the prince of all peace and mcedc is the
[21:33] king of all peace and the Millennium
[21:36] will be a place where peace is going to
[21:38] rule but if we could find the peace that
[21:40] passeth understanding under the baptism
[21:43] of the Holy Ghost then we can have a
[21:45] millennium right here on Earth we can
[21:47] live in peace with man we can live in
[21:50] peace with hearts because Jesus is our
[21:54] peace he is our peace he speaks it in
[21:56] the Book of John and he said I give unto
[21:58] you peace not like the world gives you
[22:01] but the peace I give unto you I will not
[22:04] leave you comfortless Restless unsettled
[22:07] but I'll send the comforter unto you and
[22:09] he shall comfort you see in a time of
[22:13] anxiety wasn't it what what did God do
[22:15] for Rahab am me that Gentile woman he
[22:18] gave her a token and that token was her
[22:21] peace in the time of trouble it was her
[22:24] peace when she looked around she was a
[22:26] wicked woman under a covenant of peace
[22:28] because the token represented the
[22:31] forecasting of the blood of Jesus Christ
[22:34] it was a comfort to her oh my amen the
[22:38] the peace of God Jesus is our
[22:43] peace you see the age we're living in
[22:45] amen it's the most neurotic of all ages
[22:47] that's ever
[22:48] been it's it's more neurotic than it's
[22:51] ever been uh I I I I I I'll say
[22:54] something uh let let me just read this
[22:56] here the church age book now now brother
[22:59] Bram says it like this he said God says
[23:02] to this loud to see an age it's wretched
[23:04] the Greek word comes from enduring trial
[23:07] yet it has nothing to do with trials
[23:08] that come from a Christian to a
[23:11] Christian for God describes a
[23:12] Christian's trial as blessed and his
[23:15] altitude one of Joy whereas the
[23:17] description is phrased wretched and
[23:19] miserable loud to see as wretched and
[23:23] miserable and he says see in this age of
[23:25] abundance How can there be this many
[23:27] trials
[23:29] well now it's strange but in the age of
[23:31] Plenty an opportunity and everyone has
[23:34] so much and there's so much to be had
[23:37] when all the inventions to do our work
[23:39] and so many things to give us pleasure
[23:41] suddenly we find mental illness taking
[23:44] such a toll as to alarm the nation when
[23:47] everybody ought to be happy really
[23:50] nothing to be unhappy about millions are
[23:53] taking sedatives at night and pet pills
[23:55] in the morning rushing to doctors and
[23:58] entering institutions and trying to
[24:00] drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes
[24:04] this age boast of tremendous stores of
[24:06] worldly Goods but the people are less
[24:08] happy than ever the age boast of
[24:11] spiritual attainments but the people are
[24:13] less sure of themselves than ever the
[24:16] age boast of moral values and more
[24:18] corrupt than any age since the flood it
[24:20] talks about knowledge and science but it
[24:22] is fighting a losing battle in all
[24:25] Fields the human mind and soul spirit
[24:28] cannot comprehend or keep a breast with
[24:31] the changes that have come upon this
[24:33] Earth in one generation we've gone all
[24:35] the way from a horse and buggy to a
[24:37] space age and we are proud and boastful
[24:40] about it but inside is a Dark Void
[24:42] Cavern that is crying out in torment
[24:45] without a known reason men's hearts are
[24:47] failing for fear and the world is so
[24:49] darkened that the age that we'll be
[24:51] called the age of neurotics it boast but
[24:54] it cannot back it up it cries peace but
[24:57] there is no peace it cries at a great
[25:00] amplitude of all things but it keeps
[25:02] burning with desire like an unsatisfied
[25:04] fire there is no peace saith my God to
[25:09] the wicked now now the prophet has just
[25:12] draw out something he's draw out an age
[25:14] of increase without God because God has
[25:19] been put on the outside of the church
[25:21] Christ who is our peace is knocking
[25:24] trying to get in but he's been set
[25:26] outside the
[25:27] church amen now I I maybe want to
[25:30] revisit something just for a moment I
[25:31] know sometimes I get a bad rap people
[25:33] think well you're real hard on this uh
[25:35] this uh what they call it psychology
[25:38] amen now now the reason being is because
[25:40] psychology can't answer to a soul it
[25:44] can't answer to a soul it's it's it's
[25:46] not that I'm again studying or I'm again
[25:49] somebody trying to better themselves or
[25:51] somebody trying to climb the ladder with
[25:53] with some understanding I I I think
[25:55] people perish without knowledge but but
[25:57] you got to see that God is the only
[26:00] satisfier of that Soul it's the only
[26:03] answer to that Soul see you'd be better
[26:06] off without anything and an experience
[26:08] with God than all the books in the world
[26:11] and no experience with God you see it's
[26:13] only God can satisfy that now I said
[26:16] that the other it's pretty funny because
[26:17] I get people upset at me thinking I'm
[26:19] fussing at some preacher somewhere but I
[26:21] will say this guys I've been preaching
[26:23] against psychology for 20
[26:25] years and if some preacher comes in your
[26:28] mind when I say psychology shame on that
[26:32] preacher because you never think of me
[26:35] as a psychologist because I do not
[26:37] defend
[26:41] psychology now it's funny is cuz
[26:43] sometimes even people get upset at me
[26:45] because then I'll say something like
[26:46] well in medical science if you need to
[26:48] see a psychologist go see one and then
[26:50] somebody will get upset and say well
[26:51] brother Wayne B and psychology well see
[26:53] then I'm SE when you got both sides mad
[26:55] at you you're in a good place
[26:59] you're in a good place does that means
[27:01] you've chosen middle ground that means
[27:04] look if you got a break broke arm go see
[27:06] a doctor folks if you got a clogged
[27:09] artery go see a doctor amen if your arm
[27:11] was broke You' go see one if you got a
[27:13] broken something on the encycle see one
[27:15] and somebody without God the best help
[27:18] they can get is is some help maybe a
[27:20] doctor somewhere or something look if
[27:22] somebody's about to take their life
[27:24] would you rather them take their life or
[27:25] sit down and talk to a doctor see they
[27:28] don't have any hope I'm for anything
[27:30] that helps somebody I I'm not promoting
[27:32] psychology here and somebody gets a
[27:34] little upset at me come talk to me about
[27:36] it and I'll tell you I'm not promoting
[27:38] psychology but I but I do promote
[27:40] anything that helps somebody and if they
[27:42] ain't going to get help with God God God
[27:45] God bless these people that try to help
[27:47] somebody amen and and and try to get
[27:49] them through this life amen but I'll say
[27:52] this amen the only hope for this nation
[27:55] is God the only hope for a church is God
[27:59] the only hope for a life is God the only
[28:03] way you'll overcome that anxiety is by
[28:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost let the
[28:07] power of God come down and burn it out
[28:10] of your life let God come and take that
[28:13] nervousness out of you listen you don't
[28:15] have to live your life conquered by a
[28:17] nervous Spirit or by depression or by a
[28:20] devil amen there's a God here there's a
[28:22] God here in the midst of the church that
[28:25] can burn that devil right out of your
[28:27] life that's right it's a devil don't pet
[28:31] it around and say it's a complex or it's
[28:33] a little feeling you got it's a devil
[28:35] it's a fallen spirit and it's Come From
[28:38] Hell to destroy your marriage to destroy
[28:41] your life to destroy your peace amen but
[28:44] I once was without God but not tonight I
[28:48] once was without hope but not tonight
[28:51] tonight we have receive the baptism of
[28:53] the Holy Ghost which is the
[28:55] [Applause]
[28:56] Hope amen
[28:58] which is the hope of
[29:02] life in Isaiah 9 he prophesied and said
[29:05] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[29:08] given the government shall be upon his
[29:10] shoulders and his name Shall be Called
[29:13] wonderful I love how brother bam says it

[29:17] wonderful right amen the counselor the
[29:21] Mighty God the Everlasting father the
[29:24] Prince of
[29:26] Peace amen yeah in Genesis 49 Moses
[29:31] prophesies and said the scepter shall
[29:33] not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver
[29:36] from between his feet until shallow come
[29:39] and unto him shall the Gathering of the
[29:42] people be y'all know that second
[29:43] Thessalonians 2 when Paul says the
[29:46] Gathering shall be unto him he says and
[29:48] then he turns around said there'll come
[29:49] a great Fallen away in the last days
[29:51] that day cannot come until there's a
[29:53] falling away a falling away from what
[29:55] from
[29:56] him right and and and Moses is
[29:59] prophesying of Jesus when he says a
[30:01] lawgiver shall come between his feet and
[30:03] Shadow come that word Shadow actually
[30:06] means peacegiver when the Peacekeeper
[30:09] comes when the Great Master of Peace
[30:11] steps upon the scene that's when it's
[30:14] going to be when shaloh means Peacemaker
[30:17] the Prince of Peace himself is being
[30:19] prophesied of course he was the son of
[30:21] David and Solomon himself fell under
[30:23] that rain when Solomon built his Temple
[30:26] and for 900 years offered peace upon the
[30:29] Earth brother B said they had their
[30:30] Millennium right there amen because they
[30:33] gathered around the gift that God put
[30:36] among them amen can you imagine what
[30:38] this nation would be tonight had they
[30:40] gathered around the gift that God had
[30:42] put in this age brother said what gift
[30:44] is it he said it's the Holy Ghost the
[30:46] Holy Ghost is the gift that God has sent
[30:49] into this age and we've seen it
[30:51] magnified in the ministry of William
[30:53] brandom amen that it wasn't just a
[30:55] tradition it was an emotion it wasn't
[30:58] ideas it was the person himself for the
[31:00] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[31:02] with a shout and with a voice and where
[31:05] the Lord is there is Liberty because
[31:08] he's the spirit of Liberty he's the
[31:10] spirit of peace he's the spirit of hope
[31:12] he's the spirit of life in Isaiah 53
[31:16] when Isaiah prophesied of him he said
[31:18] surely Heath borne our grease and
[31:20] carried our sorrows and we did seem him
[31:23] spitten and stricken and Afflicted but
[31:25] he was wounded for our treas
[31:28] transgressions oh God he was bruised for
[31:32] our iniquity and the chastisement of our
[31:35] peace was upon him and with his stripes

[31:41] healed my going to take a cry and fit
[31:44] for just a little bit yes sir thank you
[31:46] Lord the chastisement of my peace was
[31:49] upon him in other words he took the
[31:51] beating for you to have peace he took
[31:53] the weapon for you to have peace he held
[31:56] his peace and took the beating in his
[31:59] flesh that you could sit here tonight
[32:01] and say to that old Dreadful devil get
[32:03] away from me in the name of Jesus I've
[32:05] got peace tonight I got peace and it's
[32:08] like a river and it's flowing out of my
[32:10] soul it don't matter what's happening in
[32:13] this world around me peace lives on the
[32:16] inside of me because Jesus is the king
[32:19] of peace and he conquered my
[32:24] soul Hallelujah the chastisement of our
[32:27] peace
[32:28] was upon him and with his stripes we
[32:31] were healed we like sheep have gone
[32:34] astray and turned everyone his own way
[32:36] and the Lord had laid upon
[32:39] him the
[32:42] iniquity of us
[32:46] allall he was oppressed and he was
[32:49] afflicted yet he
[32:51] opened not his mouth
[32:56] brother right that that that's a
[32:59] conqueror that's a real one right there
[33:03] he never defended himself
[33:05] folks he opened not his mouth he didn't
[33:07] say one word in one word he could have
[33:11] brought 12 Legions of
[33:15] angels but as a lamb he was led to the
[33:17] slaughter and as a sheep before shears
[33:20] Dums he opened not his
[33:26] mouth he was taken from the prison and
[33:28] from judgment for who shall declare his
[33:31] generation for he was cut out of the
[33:33] land of the living brother said he want
[33:35] to have a wife he had desires like a man
[33:38] to have a wife and a family and have
[33:40] children but he was cut off from the
[33:42] land of the living he gave his life a 33
[33:46] year old man he didn't take a wife he
[33:48] didn't take a child he didn't give to
[33:50] anybody any bit of his own body amen but
[33:53] he knew there was another generation
[33:56] coming he knew there was a seed a super
[33:59] seed that was going to come out of him
[34:01] and that seed would be air to every
[34:03] promise that had been given no matter
[34:05] the flesh amen no matter the body you
[34:08] were born in no matter the situation God
[34:11] was going to come through and give mercy
[34:13] and decare generation amen what what was
[34:16] he saying yet it pleased the brw Lord to
[34:18] bruise him and Heth put to him to grief
[34:21] when thou shalt make his
[34:24] soul an offering for sin
[34:29] see he became our
[34:32] peace he came to destroy the
[34:35] enmity that was between you and God
[34:38] watch this in Colossians chapter 1 same
[34:39] writer Apostle Paul and having made
[34:42] peace through the blood of his cross you
[34:44] said preacher how was he the peace I'll
[34:46] tell you how he did it he made peace
[34:48] through the blood of his cross by him to
[34:51] reconcile all things if you're a studier
[34:53] you'll find out there's actually a peace
[34:55] offering in the Old Testament they had
[34:57] all kinds of offerings and one of them
[34:59] was a peace offering and it was a blood
[35:01] offering that they took and offered to
[35:03] God and they waved before the Lord and
[35:05] the comer the sacrificer ate of it and
[35:08] also the priest ate of it showing they
[35:11] both partook of the sacrifice and having
[35:13] made Beast through the blood of his
[35:15] cross by him reconciled all things unto
[35:18] himself I say whether they be things in
[35:20] the Earth or things in heaven and you
[35:23] come on somebody who was that
[35:25] you and you and we that were sometimes
[35:30] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[35:33] Wicked Works yet now have
[35:36] reconciled you who are wicked in your
[35:39] works you that were Wicked in your mind
[35:41] God help baptize our mind and we don't
[35:44] think the wicked things but God who is
[35:46] rich rich in Mercy look what he come he
[35:49] come to bring back the alienated he come
[35:51] to restore us that were enemies to God
[35:54] to our only hope we were an enemy to him
[35:57] to our only help we were an enemy we was
[36:00] an enemy to God to the Redeemer we were
[36:03] his enemy to our blessed lover we were
[36:06] his enemy but through the blood of the
[36:09] Cross he has reconciled us don't you
[36:12] ever ever put this blood under your foot
[36:14] as it's just something that you can take
[36:16] or leave the blood come on church it's
[36:19] not the chemical tonight the blood is
[36:22] the spirit that's been released in the
[36:25] church and through the spirit we have
[36:27] access to God tonight through the peace
[36:31] offering of the
[36:33] [Music]
[36:34] blood well I feel like it I thank God
[36:37] I'm not his enemy
[36:39] tonight he made peace through the
[36:42] blood of the Cross and look what he said
[36:44] in the body of his flesh through death
[36:49] to present you holy and unblamable and
[36:52] unreprovable in his
[36:55] sight Lord why didn't he die why didn't
[36:57] he give his life why it wasn't in vain
[37:00] but he took enemies and made them n to
[37:02] God he took people that couldn't
[37:04] approach God and gave you an approach an
[37:07] angel couldn't even
[37:10] take according to Ephesians chapter 2
[37:12] and verse 14 Heath broken down the
[37:15] middle wall now some people believes
[37:17] this was just the wall that was in the
[37:19] courts that separated the Jew and the
[37:21] Israelite but it's deeper than that
[37:23] friends he had broken down the middle
[37:25] wall of partition because there was laws
[37:29] in the Bible there was laws in Abraham's
[37:32] Covenant that prevented you enemies from
[37:34] coming in the presence of God can you
[37:36] imagine the Bible that you carry under
[37:39] your arm forbade you to go in the
[37:42] presence it forbade you to offer a
[37:44] sacrifice it forbade you to bring blood
[37:47] into the sanctuary it forbade you to put
[37:51] incense before God the writings of the
[37:54] Bible forbade you not only were you away
[37:57] from God you were forbidden by the word
[37:59] to go
[38:01] in I got it laying right here in front
[38:03] of me no stranger was allowed to burn
[38:06] incense in the presence of God God
[38:08] rebuked Israel for allowing aliens to
[38:11] come in and make sacrifices before the
[38:14] Lord we had no rights inside
[38:17] there but through his flesh yes
[38:22] Lord through his
[38:26] flesh
[38:28] brother Bram says it all he said see
[38:31] even in that day he said the regular
[38:33] congregation couldn't even go in under
[38:35] the blood they could go they could go
[38:38] and live under the blood but they
[38:39] couldn't go in the shukan of
[38:41] Glory even the regular Congregation of
[38:43] Israel couldn't do
[38:46] it but when the blood of Christ
[38:49] came the True
[38:51] Blood it let man get in the presence of
[38:55] the shik
[38:56] glory
[38:58] now we see this in Matthew 27 when Jesus
[39:01] dies from the cross what you're seeing
[39:04] is you're seeing God's
[39:05] Veil he was God manifested In the Flesh
[39:08] in Hebrews 1 he manifest or expressed
[39:10] him expressed him no man seen God at any
[39:13] time except in him the only begotten go
[39:17] son the image of the invisible God yes
[39:19] sir and he was hanging in plain
[39:23] view but they thought he was behind that
[39:26] temple veil
[39:28] but the Bible said in his resurrection
[39:30] amen or when when he when he cried out
[39:32] it finished I believe at the exact
[39:33] timing he screamed with a loud voice and
[39:36] the Rocks began to rent and the temple
[39:39] veil was rent from the top to the bottom
[39:43] always wondered why in the world from
[39:44] the top to the bottom but it was because
[39:47] what was it 40 foot up there I think
[39:50] they said I think it's off top of my
[39:52] head but I think it's around 40 foot
[39:53] don't Mark me on that but it was it was
[39:55] high enough a man couldn't reach it
[39:57] but brother BR said it started at the
[39:59] top and came down to prove to you who
[40:01] did
[40:02] it a man didn't stand on the earth and
[40:05] rip it up but God brought a hand from
[40:09] heaven and ripped it down because God
[40:12] was bringing his presence in the face of
[40:15] mankind and there they saw there they
[40:18] saw the plain view of the temple rail
[40:21] being rent and The Mercy Seat was no
[40:23] longer behind the veil it was hanging
[40:25] there peace was not in in that sacrifice
[40:28] any longer peace was in that Veil peace
[40:31] was there hanging on the cross the
[40:34] chastisement of our peace was a there is
[40:36] no other peace there is no other hope
[40:40] there is no other access there is no
[40:42] other life his life comes from Jesus
[40:45] Christ and Jesus
[40:48] Alone brother mam says it very clearly
[40:51] amen that he rent The Veil now that's
[40:53] coming to the that's come to the end
[40:54] time Le oosa we don't have a natural
[40:57] Veil now holding back we have
[41:00] ecclesiastical
[41:02] veils and brother Brandon says those
[41:04] ecclesiastical veils had veiled God off
[41:07] from the people amen isn't that
[41:10] something amen God and all that we know
[41:12] brother Bram said how about people that
[41:14] are veiled from the presence of God
[41:16] somebody preaches Church tradition oh my
[41:19] Mercy which adds and takes from them and
[41:21] everything by injecting their own
[41:23] subjects and their own thoughts and not
[41:24] the word of God what kind of veil is it
[41:27] it's got an ecclesiastical Veil but God
[41:30] has tore that Veil wide
[41:33] open
[41:34] Hallelujah they said there's no such
[41:37] thing as
[41:39] prophets brother I'll tell you what God
[41:41] tore that Veil
[41:43] into and we saw that Jesus is the
[41:46] prophet that Moses said amen in
[41:49] Deuteronomy the 18th for the Lord I God
[41:51] shall raise a prophet like an unto me in
[41:53] Acts the third chapter Peter refreshes
[41:56] the presence of God and said the heavens
[41:58] must receive Jesus until the restitution
[42:00] of all things amen and we shall receive
[42:03] a prophet like an unto Moses and how are
[42:05] we going to get Jesus on the earth and
[42:07] his body in heaven unless he brings a
[42:11] vessel a redeemed vessel upon the Earth
[42:15] to magnify that Jesus is still a prophet
[42:18] he is the same yesterday today and
[42:20] forever the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[42:23] the spirit of Prophecy he is the prophet
[42:26] of all prophets he amen he was a prophet
[42:28] of he was a god
[42:30] prophet he never changed he's still as
[42:33] much Prophet tonight as he ever was
[42:36] prophet
[42:37] hallelujah amen and tonight we know
[42:40] that because we're not looking at the
[42:43] veil of some tradition that says God
[42:44] don't have prophets anymore isn't it
[42:47] something amen how they quote to you the
[42:49] the the religions of the world will say
[42:50] to you they'll say well the law and the
[42:52] prophets were until John but for some
[42:55] reason they don't read the rest of the
[42:56] Bible
[42:57] the very next word it says it says and
[43:01] but after that the kingdom of God it was
[43:04] not the end of prophets it was the end
[43:07] of Law and Prophets as the government of
[43:09] God but on Mount Transfiguration we
[43:12] heard a voice come from heaven and in
[43:14] the law and the prophets amen Moses and
[43:17] Elijah was standing there and God said
[43:19] this is my beloved Son hear ye him and
[43:24] God adopted Jesus Christ as the only
[43:26] source of Hope the only source of Life
[43:29] the only source of Salvation if you need
[43:32] something from God you got to go to
[43:36] Jesus come on friend Peter said Lord to
[43:39] whom would we go come on now but if
[43:42] somebody told you Jesus ain't a prophet
[43:45] then you could see a prophet sign and
[43:47] they'll say that's some heretic or
[43:48] that's some some idea or that's some
[43:51] man-made religion oh but what a lie the
[43:53] devil told we have seen a a sign in this
[43:56] age in ought to restore peace back to
[43:58] the soul you ought to know Jesus is
[44:04] Alive you see why there's no
[44:07] peace cuz people don't know if he's
[44:10] alive go ahead they they got a tradition
[44:13] but it ain't pacifying
[44:15] them they got a church book but it ain't
[44:18] taking care of the
[44:20] Soul oh but here come here come a
[44:23] prophet of God manifesting God so real
[44:27] that we know there's prophets yes sir
[44:29] brother said there's no such thing in
[44:31] the last days Apostles and prophets
[44:33] there is no such thing as Divine Healing
[44:35] there's no such thing as sear anymore
[44:38] there's no such thing as Mark 16 being F
[44:40] fulfilled the apostolic ages already
[44:43] done they veiled it from the people but
[44:47] God walked right out with the Holy
[44:49] Spirit of fire and rent the thing from
[44:52] the top to the
[44:54] bottom hlu he tore it all open yes sir

[45:24] experience of the God that he was
[45:26] serving and he said I know he can kill a
[45:28] lion and I know he can kill a bear and
[45:30] who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[45:32] that would stand in the presence of God
[45:34] if a man has ever had an experience with

[46:46] don't know if he'll do it tonight or if
[46:48] he'll do it tomorrow or he'll do it the
[46:49] next day but one thing I know is he's
[46:52] that kind of God that'll do it when you

[47:25] it he said the blotting out of the
[47:27] handwriting the ordinances that was
[47:29] against us which was contrary to us he
[47:33] took it out of the way by nailing it to
[47:37] the
[47:38] Cross brother that's one way to do away
[47:40] with it it was his own law
[47:45] right Jesus did not come to do away with
[47:48] the
[47:50] law he came to
[47:54] fulfill
[47:55] amen that's right he fulfilled it in the

[48:19] that
[48:20] cross amen how you going to make it it's
[48:22] in that
[48:23] cross amen I don't claim any anything
[48:27] else I don't claim my abilities I don't
[48:29] claim any good thing I've done or any
[48:31] good work I pray there's some stacked up
[48:34] for some reward somewhere I don't know
[48:36] but when it comes to my salvation when
[48:38] it comes to my peace when it comes to me
[48:41] coming before God I don't bring anything
[48:44] but I say Lord it was the
[48:46] [Applause]
[48:48] cross it's in the
[48:52] cross having watch that 15th verse
[48:56] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[48:59] even the law of Commandments contained
[49:02] in the
[49:03] ordinances I got to I got to read this
[49:06] y'all read this what let's watch this
[49:09] having
[49:09] abolished in his flesh the enity right
[49:13] even the law of
[49:16] Commandments contained in the
[49:18] ordinances for to make it in himself of
[49:21] Twain one new man so making
[49:25] peace Hallelujah I didn't do it he
[49:29] did I didn't make a way he did I didn't
[49:33] save myself he did it he gave me the
[49:37] grace he gave me the blood he gave me
[49:39] the life all I've done is said Lord I
[49:41] accept your grace and your mercy and
[49:44] what you have done and I recognize
[49:46] plainly where it stands tonight he
[49:48] abolished it and he slain the enity
[49:50] thereof watch Paul in Romans 5:1
[49:53] therefore being justified by faith we
[49:56] have peace with God through our Lord
[49:59] Jesus
[50:00] Christ my goodness by whom also we have
[50:07] access we have
[50:10] access by faith into his grace where we
[50:12] stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[50:14] glory of God Ephesians 2:18 the last one
[50:17] we read there for through him we both
[50:21] have access by one Spirit unto the
[50:23] father we have an approach that's right
[50:26] to God
[50:28] see it's through him in Ephesians 3:12
[50:30] that we have boldness and access and
[50:33] confidence in him and John 10:7 Jesus
[50:36] announces I am the door to the
[50:39] Sheepfold he's the only way in in John
[50:42] 14 and6 he said I am the
[50:47] way the
[50:49] truth and the life
[50:53] amen an old boy one time I was in a in a
[50:56] little little uh uh a little hole wall
[50:59] back here in Arkansas we ate we ate a
[51:01] lot there my wife never went with me
[51:03] much she a little bit dirtier than she
[51:05] wanted to eat out you know never
[51:07] bothered me eggs were good you know
[51:10] coffee was good that's all I care about
[51:12] you know a bunch of old boys we gather
[51:13] up there one day old boy com in there
[51:16] and he'd been serving he' been in a
[51:17] Pentecostal church a little bit and we
[51:19] were it was kind of one of them
[51:21] Community things everybody sitting we
[51:22] like you sitting in the same room you
[51:24] know and they all knew I was a preacher
[51:26] so one of them said something to me and
[51:27] he said he he's a backslid boy backslid
[51:30] Pentecostal boy he said well preacher he
[51:32] said which one of you guys got the truth
[51:36] anyhow I said well it ain't our
[51:39] church I said it ain't your church
[51:43] either yeah amen he said well who's got
[51:46] the truth I said Jesus said he was the
[51:48] truth and any man that's got Jesus has
[51:51] got
[51:52] truth come on you can't claim truth for
[51:56] yourself you can't say I got the truth
[51:59] that a truth might have
[52:02] you but it would be pretty arrogant of
[52:05] you to imagine that you got everything
[52:07] God's Got In
[52:09] Truth come on church but but God is
[52:13] truth Jesus is truth and what I don't
[52:17] know about him I got him Hallelujah I
[52:21] might not know all the answers but I got
[52:23] him inside me truth lives inside me
[52:27] H we're not starting no denomination
[52:29] we're not starting our forign no more I
[52:31] say any man that comes to Jesus has come
[52:34] to truth and he is the way the truth and
[52:37] the life and no man come unto
[52:40] him John 6:44 is one brother R's
[52:43] favorite scriptures no man come to me
[52:44] except the Father which sent me draw him
[52:47] and I will raise him up in the last day
[52:49] now here's brother random scripture on
[52:51] this an approach or an access to God
[52:55] look in Psalm 65 and vers vers four for
[52:57] blessed is the
[53:00] man
[53:02] who whom thou
[53:05] choosest and
[53:08] causeth to approach unto thee that he
[53:11] may dwell in thy courts and we shall be
[53:13] satisfied with the goodness of thine
[53:14] house even of thine Holy Temple now
[53:18] blessed is a man whom thou
[53:21] chooseth and
[53:23] causeth to approach unto him now brother
[53:26] preaches a message if you want to do
[53:27] some homework tomorrow it's called
[53:29] approach to God he uses this scripture
[53:32] as powerful blessed is the man whom thou
[53:34] choosest and causest to approach in the
[53:37] church age book brother bam uses this he
[53:39] said see they were not a true church but
[53:41] a false Church they were the synagogue
[53:44] of Satan you know the scripture the
[53:45] synagogue of Satan now the word
[53:47] synagogue is not the same word used for
[53:50] church in the Bible which means called
[53:51] out ones it means the summoned
[53:54] ones he said or the summonsed ones he
[53:56] said the psalmist said about these elect
[53:59] people blessed is the man whom thou
[54:02] choosest and who thou cuse to approach
[54:05] unto thee that theyou might dwell in thy
[54:07] courts but the meaning of synagogue is
[54:10] simply as assembling or
[54:13] gathering now this can be good or
[54:16] bad now in this case it is
[54:19] bad for they are those which are
[54:22] assembling is not of God but of
[54:25] themselves
[54:27] see Isaiah said they shall they shall
[54:30] surely gather together but not by
[54:34] me
[54:38] right now look what he's
[54:41] saying blessed is a man whom I choose
[54:45] and
[54:46] cause to come to
[54:50] me right now I just preached on the
[54:53] brooding
[54:54] logos on Eagles
[54:56] Wings he bore them right brother B said
[55:00] what was those Eagles Wings it was
[55:01] Moses's Vindicated message and they were
[55:04] following
[55:05] Moses and while they were following
[55:08] Moses they went through the Red Sea and
[55:11] people trying to impersonate them
[55:14] drowned in the sea right but brother man
[55:17] said but Moses got oversea the children
[55:20] Israel got over because they were bore
[55:22] on Eagle
[55:24] wings now there are Gatherings that are
[55:28] not caused by
[55:31] God you see he says there's churches in
[55:34] the Bible was telling synagogues there
[55:36] are places that are gathering even
[55:38] religious gatherings but it's not caused
[55:41] by
[55:43] God if you want to get real strong in it
[55:45] brother bam says they'll worship the
[55:48] devil and don't even know they're doing
[55:50] it
[55:52] sir
[55:53] right now now how far off see listen
[55:58] they worship God in
[56:02] vain by Tradition now watch what what's
[56:05] what I'm talking about here in Matthew
[56:07] 24 it says that they will deceive the
[56:10] very
[56:12] elect if it were possible brother said
[56:15] watch that word election Jesus brings it
[56:17] up there will be an elect seed in the
[56:20] last
[56:21] days so there is a gathering under Satan
[56:24] and y'all know brother BR talks about it
[56:27] he gathers them he said but God will
[56:29] gather a people by vindicating his word
[56:32] amen yeah amen blessed is
[56:37] he that God
[56:39] chooseth and causes to come to him do
[56:43] you know there was a million people
[56:44] tonight you got
[56:46] saved now what was it that struck your
[56:49] heart about the message amen of the
[56:53] hour what is it that caused you amen
[56:56] to come into the presence of God see
[57:01] something is giving you access something
[57:04] is giving you access now I got one more
[57:06] scripture here in
[57:07] closing in Psalms 24 David says this for
[57:11] the Earth is the Lords and the fullness
[57:13] thereof
[57:14] amen the world and they that dwell
[57:17] therein for Heath founded it upon the
[57:20] Seas and established it upon the
[57:23] floods who shall Ascend into the hill of
[57:27] our Lord and who shall stand in the Holy
[57:32] place he that hath Clean Hands and a
[57:36] pure
[57:37] heart who ha not lifted up his soul into
[57:40] vanity nor swore deceitfully he shall
[57:43] receive the blessing from the Lord and
[57:44] the righteousness from the god of our
[57:46] Salvation this is the generation of them
[57:48] that seek him they seek thy face oh
[57:53] Jacob blessed are they with a pure heart
[57:57] for they shall
[57:58] see
[58:01] God see
[58:05] friends God has chose us tonight to come
[58:07] into His presence can the musicians
[58:10] come he has
[58:13] chosen blessed is he that
[58:16] chooseth and
[58:22] causeth Moses was okay 40 years
[58:26] family sheep he was doing good his way
[58:29] from Egypt but God caused him to
[58:34] turn to see that Vindication in that
[58:37] Pillar of Fire and he reminded him of
[58:40] the
[58:41] promises and then he went down into the
[58:43] power of God because God chose him and
[58:47] caused him right do you see tonight
[58:50] there's an approach we got an approach
[58:51] to God yeah brother B said when job
[58:54] didn't have a Bible he had revelation
[58:57] and that Revelation caused him to have
[58:59] the right approach and even when he was
[59:02] when his children was in
[59:05] trouble he had an approach to God when
[59:09] problems came he had an approach to God
[59:13] listen we have a high priest tonight
