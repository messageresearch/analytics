To be given that kind of name that we could speak it and know the power of it. Amen. Amen. We sure uh certainly appreciate each of you today. And and just before we go into the word of the Lord, maybe we just bow our hearts with a word of prayer and let's just speak to him today. Amen. Father, we are so honored to be in your house today to come together as your children. Lord, we love you and we thank you for the great and grand opportunity to serve you before this congregation and before all that would hear this. Lord, we humble ourselves to you and to your grace that's been in our lives. Truly, Lord, we are unworthy of you. And Lord, there's nothing good of any man. But Lord, by your grace and your mercy, we could stand here today as your son. And we ask you for all that grace and mercy, Lord, to be dispensed through your gospel this morning to every need to your children today. Lord, as we exalt the name of our Lord Jesus, we ask you that you would give the grace and the anointing. Lord, I pray this morning that Lord, every spirit unlike you that Lord, may it be bound this morning &gt;&gt; by the power of your word and Lord, may there be an anointing loosed in this building that Lord, even the angels of God would feel the freedom to come here among us this morning and help us as we lift up your holy name, Lord. that it would be lifted to the place that every man could look up and see a hope and a and an ability. Lord, now we ask that this morning, Father, that you would send this kind of grace as we ask these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless you. If you have your Bibles today, uh we'd like to go into the word of the Lord. I'm going to be speaking to you again out of the book of Hebrews, the first chapter. Uh, I want to uh read Hebrews chapter 1. And I want to go uh into the fourth verse this morning. Uh, Hebrews 1 and verse 4. And I'm going to read down to the 14th verse. Um, if you're studying the book of Hebrews that uh, Brother Brand preached a series on the book of Hebrews and he doesn't spend much time in the latter parts of this uh, particular verse. He or chapter he changes to chapter 2 pretty quickly out of this. But I just want to take a few minutes uh in this and maybe a couple more services in the Hebrews chapter 1. And I want to read here from the fourth verse. And being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my son, this day I begotten thee. And again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten of the world, he saith, and let all the angels of God worship him. And of the angels he saith, who maketh his angel spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire? But unto the Son he saith, "Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom. For thou loveth righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And thou, Lord, in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thine hands." My goodness, wasn't Paul a writer? And they shall perish, but thou remainest, and they shall all wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture, thou shalt fold them up. He's speaking of creative things, the universe itself. And they shall be changed, but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. But to which of the angels, he said, at any time, sit, on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foottools? Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them who shall be the heir of salvation? May God bless his word as you could be seated this morning. Uh, of course, uh, Paul uh, this this writer um, brother Bram tells us that he is the writer, but then he also tells us that what's writing is the creative being inside of Paul. Uh, because now we're hearing it from the sun. This is the revelation of it. And uh I I think these um this chapter one is amazing because Paul has done something in the first couple verses in that he he has told you that Jesus is superior to all prophets. And he's telling you he's not just a prophet, but he's the God of the prophets. And then when he comes to this point, then he's now going to start comparing him to angels. And uh I I I think it's powerful myself because uh uh Paul I was just me and brother Ray was just talking about this. I think it was amazing myself uh that you know wouldn't it have been something to sit in one of Apostle Paul's services. Wouldn't it wouldn't it have been something to sit in the service and hear Paul bringing the Old Testament. Amen. And the revelation that he had caught of Jesus Christ and detailing that to the congregation. You know uh I'm I'm I'm a reader. So I sit and read the book of Hebrews and I read the first chapter of Hebrews and moved to tears, you know, sometimes move to uh such a such a just such an energy moves in you. Just reading what Paul said just puts something in you makes you want to just scream out loud when you're even all by yourself. And I thought my what just to read this letter would have been something to have sat in the presence and heard this spoken uh in such a way. And and and you know I I I think of the of of what he had saw that he was so pushing to the people is these were Jews and Paul was trying to tell them, Amen, that this Jesus that this Jesus himself has is has been exalted that he is the appointed heir. And I I love how the first two verses he said God in sunry times and diverse manners spake unto the fathers by the prophets but hath in the last days spoken unto us by his son. And we've we've exhausted that pretty heavily. But watch this next part of this. For whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world. And and and brother Brandham picks this up in Hebrews chapter 1 and speaking of Jesus and he said, "He has been appointed the heir of all things." Amen. And and I I I think it's very powerful because this appointment of course is speaking of that he has inherited all things. Now, if you study the message years ago, I was on dispensations at a Bible conference and I I was studying the son of God, the son of David, the son of man. But it was in that study that I really picked up the son of Abraham as well. And you'll see that he comes under different names. And brother Bam tells us when Jesus is the son of David, he's heir to the throne of David. And and there's a Davidic covenant. And when he's the son of Abraham, of course, he was the son of Abraham, then he is heir uh uh to the to the grant according to the actual earth because that was the promise given unto Abraham. But then as the son of man, he was heir to the natural things. But then as the son of God, brother Bram said that means he was heir to everything. So it wasn't nothing that he was not heir to as the son of God. And so this morning we we recognize that that appointment that was given to Jesus started all the way back in the messianic prophecies of Genesis chapter 1. Sometimes people think the Abrahamic covenant began in Genesis 12, but honestly it began in Genesis 3 when the seed was appointed uh uh to defeat the serpent seed when God came in Genesis 3 and 15 and he tells them he says, "And the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the serpent." He appointed a seed that was going to defeat. See, that's when it that's when it come into contact. As brother Bram said, what happened was when God's children got in trouble in Eden, he said it was love that funneled down and made a way. It was God himself came and made a covenant with love that would make a way for them to return. Amen. So, it was under under that covenant. He was an appointed seed. He was the appointed heir of all things. Brother Bam makes these connections in Hebrews chapter 1 part uh in paragraph 106 and 107 and he says that Jesus was the appointed seed and the appointed heir. He's showing the same thing the appointed heir and appointed seed from the from the garden of of Eden. And he said that's what constantly that Satan had watched for was for that seed to come forth. So that's when Abel was born. That's why Cain slew Abel because he was trying to stop the appointed heir of all things. Satan was doing his best to stop it. When he killed Cain, killed Abel, he was trying to stop it. But brother Bam then goes on to say, he said, "But see then God caused Eve to bring forth Seth, which spoke of the resurrection of that seed." So in other words, you can do what you want to do to kill it, but you're not going to kill it because God's going to raise it up again. So he was showing that this was going to be an unstoppable heir. If this this seed would be an unstoppable seed and we can see it all the way through the Old Testament. You can see how in the message Joseph meeting his brethren, brother Bam says when he met his brethren in the field and they hated him. He said they did it without a cause. It was because of that seed promise that Satan was always after that seed. They tried to kill Joseph. BUT REALLY, IT WASN'T just Joseph they was after, was it? Because Joseph was going to be the thing that would cause the entire land or the seed life of Israel to remain. If you would have killed Joseph, look at what would have happened. But Joseph was the one that went down to Egypt and he didn't just save Israel, he basically saved all of humanity in that famine. Amen. To show that you will never stop that seed. It's a unstoppable seed. it it's all the way up through the scriptures. You can see it when when you look in the scripture, you see that right in the middle of Joseph, they're trying to stop it. That's when Tamar shows up and and Tamar then plays a part of a harlot and accepts the seed of Judah. And then Judah is going to burn his own seed because he don't understand. But it's when she reveals the seed that's in me is the seed of Judah and it's for the posterity of Judah. And when that seed is revealed, that's when the revelation comes. We can't take her life because of the seed that's on the inside of her. Amen. WHY COULDN'T GOD TAKE SARAH'S LIFE? Because she was going to bring forth that same seed. Oh my goodness. If God could protect the natural course that was going to bring that seed. What about the spiritual seed that he promised to bring forth? When I look at this, I find it's amazing. That's exactly what happens in Esther. Remember, Amen. the Esther, she's hid because non is trying to destroy all the Jews. He's trying to kill that seed. But it's not until that last seal is broken open. When in the presence of the enemy and the presence of the king, it is revealed that Esther is the seed of that Jew. And when THAT'S REVEALED, WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. IT GIVES HER liberty to KNOW THAT SHE'S OF THAT SEED. I'll tell you, amen. If you ever discover, Amen. that you're of the same seed that was that appointed seed back in the garden. You'll find out that the devil couldn't stop it. Amen. When it was in when it was in Abel, when it was in Seth, he couldn't stop that seed line. When it was David, he couldn't stop it. WHEN IT WAS JOSHUA, he couldn't stop it. WHEN IT WAS MOSES, AMEN. THEN WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS morning that he's going to stop this supernatural seed of Abraham? FOR THERE'S A PROMISE OVER YOUR LIFE THAT YOU SHALL POSSESS the gates of your enemy. AND THERE IS NO WEAPON. LOOK AT THAT. THERE IS NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU THAT CAN PROSPER. AMEN. BECAUSE GOD has made promises concerning this seed. You are the appointed seed. I'll say this. If you Amen. are the the appointed seed of God. You are Abraham's seed. You're Gentiles, right? &gt;&gt; So if you're going to be the seed of God this morning, you have to be seed through Abraham, which is Abrahamic seed, which is by promise. Uh if you're uh if you uh like to study your Bible, the book of Romans, the 8th chapter said that we're heirs with Jesus Christ. We're heir of God, but it's with Jesus Christ and we are joint hes and we are heir to every promise. That's why when Jesus spoke to the fig tree and and it withered and the next day he said, "If you would have faith in God, then you could say unto this mountain." because he was showing that what he was exercising in the earth was being done as an heir of God. So any believer would have an airship to the same promises and the same authority THAT HE WAS SHOWING on the earth because he was doing it to show the promises made to the seed of Adam. When I I look back at this and see that you're an heir to every promise, a joint heir to every promise, you know, to be an heir is different than earning something, right? Amen. It matters the family you're born in. If you're born into a poor family, sorry, uh you're just going to be uh you're going to get an inheritance, but it might not be much. But if you're born into a more wealthy inheritance, then you're born into that. They call it being born with a silver spoon in the mouth, you know. Amen. But you you you recognize as you are born as a child of God that you're born as an heir of everything because you are a son of God. Amen. Then you're an heir. Now, you might say this morning, well, brother Wayne, I've got a lot of fear and there's a lot of things happening and I'm afraid and I don't know if I'm really worthy of these things. But, Brother Brandham says it like this, "What are you scared about? Are you afraid to take his word?" Now, don't be afraid and call the thing right. I'm an heir to this. Now, I do not DESERVE THIS. I KNOW I don't deserve this, but I'm an heir anyhow. Do you see? Because I'm an heir, I receive it. There it is. Because I'm an heir. I'm an heir of salvation. I'm an heir of the Holy Spirit. I'm an heir because Jesus paid the price. I didn't have to do nothing. I just fell HEIR TO IT. AMEN. AMEN. I'll tell you this. Amen. If you've been born again, you're an heir this morning. And it's not what you're earning. It's what you have inherited because of the seed THAT YOU ARE. AMEN. I KNOW WHO YOUR earthly daddy or mama might be important to this natural life, but in the spiritual sense, if you're a son or daughter of God, YOU ARE HEIR TO EVERYTHING THAT GOD HAS as being a child of God. &gt;&gt; My when I think about this, sometimes you get under certain spirits and and those spirits don't want you to see what belongs to you. But, you know, I I think it's time that you come out from under any unbelief. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think this is THE TIME THAT GOD IS SEPARATING his children from all unbelief. I I believe this. Brother Brham said, "Separating from the evil one, the one on the outside, see, taste, feel, smell, hear." Amen. We got to get beyond the human that we might be able to see the divine promises that have been made to you. Not in your humanity, but in your heirship OF THE SEED OF ABRAHAM. Oh my. They your your father Abraham had a had a season. And he didn't see all of his promises because brother Bam said when God called him, he took Lot with him. Remember? Amen. And and the Bible tells us in Genesis 13 after that Abraham separated from Lot, it was then that Melkazedc appears to him and tells him to look north, south, east, and west. And whatever you see belongs to you. Do you see until if you're under something or someone that has got you thinking that something don't belong because I'm not worthy of it and I could never obtain this and I can never do you see then that's a veil of unbelief that's keeps you from THE PROMISES THAT GOD HAS MADE TO YOU. It's a little bit like a seed being in the shock. Amen. And under the shuck of Pentecost, you were you were kept away from all of the divine promises that God made under this generation. BUT WHEN YOU MADE A SEPARATION, you come out into a land and if you're looking east or you're looking north or you're looking south, if you're looking up, whichever way you look, IT ALL BELONGS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, I I don't know how you're looking this morning, but I say YOU OUGHT TO LOOK PAST THE veil of unbelief and say, "It belongs to me. Healing belongs to me. SALVATION BELONGS to me." AMEN. JOY BELONGS to me. Life belongs to me. It's mine because I'm an heir. So, brother Wayne, what did you do to earn it? Nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I didn't do anything to earn it. You can't do anything to earn it because it all belongs to you. And after your separation, you can look up and see that every promise is unto you because God has gave that promise. In Galatians 3:16, it says the promises were made unto as seeds as of many, but as of one to that seed which is Christ. These promises were made in Romans 8 and32. He said he delivered him up and how shall not with him freely give us all things. &gt;&gt; Jesus freely gave us all things. That's a lot of things, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham preaches the pardon out of that scripture and he said, "If you give us all things, he can give us a pardon, too." My goodness, isn't that amazing? Amen. In 2 Corinthians 6 and:e 10, you may feel like Paul, sorrowful yet rejoicing. poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet I possess all things. I tell you, you might not have a mansion or a fancy car, but if you're a child of God, you possess all things. THAT'S WHY JESUS wouldn't bow to the devil to take the world when he was on the earth because HE KNEW IT WOULD FALL HEIR TO IT ANYHOW. And I say this this morning, I all them rich folks out there on the coast of North Carolina and down Florida and them big ma fancy places, Mara Lago and all of them. I tell you this, you can have them right now. Amen. But when the millennium comes, we going to own it all. Amen. When the millennium comes, we got THE BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE. You them northern ROCKIES UP ALONG CANADA, YOU CAN HAVE THAT CABIN UP ON the top of the hill if you want to. Amen. Come looking for me. You'll hear it. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. Yeah. I tell you what, it might be a cowboy mansion, but it'll be a big old log cabin. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm heir to it. See? Amen. You You see, it might be in the unseen. And you may say, "He has nothing, but he possesses all things as a son of Abraham." And I'm looking to that. I'm not looking to that in the millennium. And I think that is a bit of an issue that we push everything off to the millennium. But the prophet of God said, "We really need somebody to call the promises present tense right now." We we need something in us as Abraham's seed to call it present tense right now. It's not I'm going to be healed, I am healed. NOT THAT I'M GOING TO BE SAVED, I am saved. AMEN. THIS IS NOT A FUTURE EVENT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE POSSESS RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING. AND GOD HAS PREPARED FOR YOU A TABLE RIGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF YOUR ENEMY. AND THE ENEMY TRYING TO TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY FROM YOU. AND GOD FILLS THE TABLE UP AND SAYS, "IT'S all yours." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're an heir. We're not going to be a son just in the millennium. We are sons right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's with me this morning? Are you a son right now? I'm a son right now. Not just in the millennium. I'm a son right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you it's a powerful thing when you see as being a son its inheritance and and let me continue in Hebrews. Hebrews 1 and verse uh three says that he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high and being made better. Now this is Jesus being made better so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they excellent name than they. Who's he talking about? He's talking about a greater name than even the angels. NOW, NOW, NOW PAUL IS TALKING TO THESE JEWS. AMEN. And in their world, even in the tabernacle that Moses has built, there is cherubams that are over the ark of the covenant IN THE MOST HOLY PLACE. AND THESE, THEY KNOW ABOUT SARAPHIMS and they KNOW ABOUT MICHAEL AND THEY KNOW ABOUT GABRIEL AND THEY KNOW ABOUT THE GREAT ANGELS. AND HERE PAUL IS TELLING them a man that they have all crucified as a fanatic is has a name that is greater than the angels of heaven. My what a preacher. Amen. Th this this man that you have despised HAS GOT A GREATER name than even them that which is in heaven. Amen. And and he proves it by saying FOR UNTO WHICH of the angels hath he at any time said thou art my son and I have begotten thee? AMEN. WHEN DID GOD EVER TELL AN ANGEL, "You're my son and I have begotten thee." He never did that. He made THEM FLAMES OF FIRE and he made them ministering spirits, but he never gave them a throne to rule over the earth. &gt;&gt; My goodness, he highly exalted him. I I TELL YOU, PAUL was exalting Jesus Christ. And I don't think you can overexalt him. &gt;&gt; In Philippians, same writer, Philippians chapter 2, let's read it from a different perspective. Philippians chapter 2 and verse 9. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him. Amen. And given him a name which is above every name, that the name of Jesus, he calls his name, don't he? And the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven, things in earth, and things under the earth. And that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Oh, I love that. Don't you? and he hath exalted him and given him a name that is above every name. You know, I I tried to do a little study last night, but you it's hard to it's hard to put a number on it, but they think there's nearly 117 billion people that has lived on planet Earth since it has began. That's a lot of names. &gt;&gt; There's currently about 8 billion people on Earth right now. And there is some very important people on this earth. There are presidents and there are kings and there's monarchies and there's every kind of humanity that's on the earth. But you could stand here and name 8 billion names right now. And there is not one of those names you could name that would be above the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. THERE IS NO PROPHET. THERE IS NO PRIEST. THERE IS NO KING. AMEN. WHAT HE WAS SAYING, LISTEN TO THIS. WHAT HIS MAN WAS SAYING, WHICH HE'S SAYING, "YOU GOT YOUR PROPHET MOSES, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, THE NAME OF JESUS IS HIGHER THAN THE NAME OF MOSES, THEN OF ISAIAH." COME ON, LET'S MOVE IT. AMEN. Let's move it IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. IT'S GREATER THAN THE NAME OF PAUL. IT'S GREATER. IT'S GREATER THAN THE NAME OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM. IT'S GREATER THAN LUTHER. IT'S GREATER THAN WESLEY. THIS NAME OF JESUS IS THE GREATEST OF ALL NAMES THAT HAVE EVER BEEN SPOKEN OFF OF HUMAN LIPS. THERE IS NO NAME. THERE IS NO PREACHER, THERE IS NO PROPHET, THERE IS NO ANGEL, THERE IS NOTHING IN HEAVENS OR IN EARTH OR BENEATH THE EARTH THAT HAS A name equivalent to the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; My goodness, that name, that name of Jesus, no wonder Paul was trying to tell the people, everything you do, do it in the name of Jesus Christ. WHEN YOU BAPTIZE, YOU SHOULD BAPTIZE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. WHEN YOU PRAY FOR THE SICK, YOU GOT TO DO IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. WHEN YOU ASK FOR DELIVERANCE, DO IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT YOU can say the name of Jesus Christ? Amen. I I got a pretty decent memory at times, but it's not so good that I can remember all the redemptive names of God that I could stand here and tell you. I know there's seven of them. I can name them pretty good. You know, Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Sha, Jehovah Shalom. Amen. We have Jehovah Rafi, Jehovah Sidkadoo. AMEN. WE WE RECOGNIZE that these names and there's seven redemptives that reveals the name of God. BUT WHEN MOSES MET HIM, he said he didn't have a name. Amen. He just said, "I am that I AM." BUT THERE WAS NO human name of redemption for all of mankind. AMEN. SO, THANK GOD THIS MORNING. I DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER 422 NAMES TO FIND SOMETHING THAT HAS POWER OVER THE DEVIL. THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS A SUPREME NAME OVER ALL POWERS, WHETHER THEY BE EVIL OR HEAVENLY. THE NAME OF JESUS RULES over all names. &gt;&gt; My goodness, I love how Brother Bam did it and he comes and he he did it and then told us about it when he was in that great uh service over there in India. Remember that boy come up and he he had that man come up and he had a he was blind from worshiping the sun. And brother Bram said, "I just met with all of the great religions of that day, Hindus and and Buddhists." And he said, "I met with all of them." And he said, "That blind man come up who was blind from his religious worship. &gt;&gt; And he wanted a deliverance from that blindness." And he come to brother Brandham. And brother Bam said, "Look, here's a blind man standing right here." He said, "Now, one of you Hindus or one of you m I stood right where he stood. I literally stood in the same pulpit this happened in in India. And he stood there and he said to them, HE SAID, "WHICH OF YOUR religions can give a man back his sight? Let him come right now and do it." &gt;&gt; He didn't ask for just a a theological discussion or a debate as many today only exercise the power of debate AS SPIRITUAL OR AND LISTEN, I KNOW PEOPLE'S got Bibles and they preach and and seem like most time they're preaching against the movement of the spirit these days, but they can argue. BUT YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN DO that a that a Muslim can't do. YOU CAN ARGUE A GOOD ARGUMENT, BUT A TERRORIST HAS A GOOD ARGUMENT. AMEN. BUT A CHRISTIAN SHOULD HAVE A POWER. &gt;&gt; THERE SHOULD BE A POWER IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. NOT JUST THE POWER OF DEBATE OR THE POWER OF AN ARGUMENT, BUT THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION OUGHT TO EXIST IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. Oh my goodness. Brother Bam said, I don't, this is brother Bam's words. He said, "Some of these ministers today," he said, "they carry the Bible but don't have enough power to break an egg." &gt;&gt; The only time they get anointed is when they're fussing about something. Well, I I think there ought to be an anointing ON PREACHING THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST IN THIS GENERATION. &gt;&gt; You You know, Brother Bam actually invited them to come and heal come and heal this man. And brother Eric, they all sat still. And it's a good thing they did. But it WAS A A BIT JUST LIKE it was on Mount Carmel, wasn't it? There was Elijah again and there was all the religions of the world again. AND THEY SAT REAL QUIET BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEIR gods was only the form of their imagination OR SOME FALLEN ANGEL. BUT JESUS IS THE ONLY GOD. HE'S THE ONLY REAL GOD. AND BROTHER RAM SAID, "NOW SINCE YOUR GODS CAN'T DO THIS IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, LET HIS EYES COME OPEN." OPEN. Brother said when HIS EYES COME OPEN, HE SAID THEY ALL BEGIN TO REJOICE and they like to tore the clothes off of brother Brandham because he was a representative of Jesus Christ and they sing the power EXHIBITED AND HIS EYES COME OPEN. THAT same thing happened in Africa and 30,000 GAVE THEIR LIFE IN ONE ALTAR CALL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T JUST HAVE A DEBATE, HE HAD A POWER AND THAT POWER WAS THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION. MY WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT THIS MORNING. OH, I PRAY WE DON'T RE THAT WE DON'T RELAX OURSELVES JUST TO A GOOD DEBATE TACTIC OR GOOD THEOLOGIAN. BUT I PRAY THAT THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTED ONE IS STILL ALLOWED IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; I tell you THIS IS ONE CHURCH THAT'LL NOT SHUT their doors to it. &gt;&gt; It's Leodysa church. He's on the outside. Brother Bam said well I tell you thank God we're not the Leodysian church. We've opened our doors and said, "Come on in here, Lord, and you be the Lord of our church. You be the LORD OF OUR LIVES. YOU HEAL THEM. YOU DELIVER THEM. YOU FILL THEM. YOU COME AMONG US. AND YOU CAN BE WORSHIPED LIKE YOU could worship in heaven. Highly exalted." &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bram does things cuz he talks about that witch doctor right over in Indiana. And he said they brought him in said, "Brother Bam, you're supposed to be a powerhouse and they made a table float. Witchcraft's real. I it's it's a real perversion of truth. And and brother Bam actually said it's odd. I I don't I'm not on preachers, but brother Bam said it's actually HE SAID HE SAID I would rather have breakfast, he said, with a bunch of witch doctors than a bunch of preachers. &gt;&gt; Now, now you said, why did he do that? Because at least the witch doctors understood there is a supernatural. &gt;&gt; And he was trying to explain to them. He said, now these these heathens know there's a supernatural to the to the atmosphere. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Some of us don't know that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and Brother Brandham was explaining that, but then they took him over there. And I doubt he really wanted to have a breakfast with a a witch doctor. I think he was just making comparison. But but that table, Brother Bam said he walked in that room, they had a seance going on. They had a table floating. And he said when he looked at that table, they said they were grown men hanging on the corner of that table trying to pull it down and they couldn't do it. So human strength couldn't pull it down. And they said to brother Bandham, "Can you make it come down?" He said, "No, I'm sorry. I can't." And he said, "But but I know one that can," you know. And so he looks at this and Brother Bam does it on purpose. And he said, "I said in the name of the Holy Roman Church, table, you come down." He said, "It just stayed right there." He said, "I said, in the name of the Father and the name of the Son and the name of the Holy Ghost, table, come down." He said, "It stayed right there." And I love it. And he said, I said, "IN THE NAME OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM, TABLE, come down." and it stayed right there. He said, "But then I let them know where the power lays in the name OF JESUS CHRIST." TABLE COME DOWN. HE SAID, "THE LEGS ALMOST BROKE WHEN THEY WERE COMING TO THE GROUND." YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S POWER IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. HIS NAME IS TO BE EXALTED ABOVE ALL NAMES. IT'S THE POWER OF YOUR HEALING. IT'S THE POWER OF YOUR SALVATION. IT'S THE POWER OF MY LIFE. IT'S THE POWER OF THIS CHURCH. IT'S THE POWER of the name of Jesus Christ. My goodness, I recognize today that we have that we are in an age, amen, when everything has tried to make him just another prophet or just a brother OR HE'S JUST SOME SOUSSAYER OR SOME TEACHER. AMEN. BUT I DEFY THAT UNBELIEVING DEVIL. HE IS THE SUPREME GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH AND HE IS THE OBJECT OF OUR WORSHIP. My apostle Paul was straight on the matter in Ephesians chapter 1. He said, "His exceeding greatness of his power toward us believe according to the working of his power which he wrought in Christ, raised him from the dead, set him at the right hand in heavenly places." You know that that's not two thrones up there. You know that Jesus sits in the authority of the power of almighty God. IT'S FAR ABOVE. I LOVE THAT. FAR. SOMEBODY SAY FAR ABOVE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST ABOVE. IT'S FAR ABOVE the principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named. My we should take a week on names. YOU SAY IT. JUST SAY IT RIGHT NOW AND I TELL YOU IT'S ABOVE IT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER, WHAT ABOUT CANCER?" THE NAME OF JESUS IS ABOVE IT. WHAT ABOUT SCOLIOSIS? THE NAME OF JESUS IS ABOVE IT. WHAT ABOUT STROKES? THE NAME OF JESUS IS ABOVE IT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR BLINDNESS, BUT I KNOW ABOUT MY JESUS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR TRIAL, BUT I KNOW THERE'S A GOD AND THERE'S A POWER OVER THE TRIAL. HIS NAME IS JESUS. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT YOU CALL IT OR WHAT NAME IS GIVEN. GOD GAVE ME one answer for the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I'M SUFFERING WITH DEPRESSION. HIS NAME IS JESUS. I'VE GOT ANXIETY. HIS NAME IS JESUS. &gt;&gt; You You just keep naming it. I just going to put one name back. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's it's the winning answer, folks. &gt;&gt; It's the winning answer. And we're not just saying a name. We have a revelation of that name. &gt;&gt; Do you do you see? He's above every dominion, above every name. That is named not only in this world, &gt;&gt; BUT ALSO IN THAT WHICH IS TO COME. SOME PEOPLE THINK Jesus just going to be a brother in millennium. THAT'S A HERETIC. &gt;&gt; GOD AWFUL DOCTRINE. JESUS AIN'T JUST OUR BROTHER. HE'S OUR LORD. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID THERE WOULDN'T EVEN BE A NEED OF A TEMPLE IN THE NEW JERUSALEM BECAUSE THE LAMB WOULD BE THE CENTER OF OUR WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; He had put all things under his feet and given the head of all all things to the church. That's when brother Bram stops and says, "Listen, if you're even the skin on the bottom of the foot of Jesus Christ, you're above the devil. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE THE WEAKEST person in this building, BUT IF YOU'RE IN CHRIST, YOU'RE OVER THE DEVIL." AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEN THAT MEANS HE'S WEAKER AND HE'S BEEN DEFEATED. HE'S BEEN PUT UNDER IT. AND YOU JUST NEED TO GET OUT FROM UNDER WHATEVER SPIRIT THAT WON'T LET YOU BELIEVE THAT. WHATEVER DEVIL HAS TRIED TO COMPARE THAT YOUR SITUATION IS GREATER THAN THE NAME OF JESUS, THAT IS A DEMON OF UNBELIEF. AND YOU NEED TO REBUKE IT THIS MORNING AND SAY, "MY GOD IS A GOD OF SALVATION AND OF HEALING AND A GOD OF DELIVERANCE." AND INSTEAD OF GETTING UNDERNEATH THE THING, START WORSHIPING THE GOD WHO CAN DELIVER YOU OF THE THING. &gt;&gt; I believe it this morning. Somebody said, "Well, Bo, look." Now, Paul Paul actually is quoting seven Old Testament scriptures in the next few verses. And the and one of the scriptures he's using, for which the angels ever said, "Set thou uh the Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foottools." That's Psalms 110 verse1. Jesus uses that own scripture to describe who he was. And then also these apostles and disciples knew that Jesus was fulfilling that messianic prophecy of Psalms 110 that he would set at his right hand. And just quickly, we'll run through these so you can have them. Mark 16 19 and 20. And after the Lord had spoken, he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God. Amen. watching the in in Acts chapter 2. It's hard to fly through this one. It's so powerful. Acts 2 and 29. This is one save 3,000 about 15 minute sermon. Men and Peter, men and brethren, freely speak unto you of the patriarch David. He is both dead and buried and is in the septic with us today. Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God has swore an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on the throne. seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell. There's Psalm 16. Neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up. Wherefore we are all witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God, exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, and he has shed forth this, and ye now see and hear. FOR DAVID is not ascended under the heavens, but saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, set thou at my right hand until I make thine enemy thy foottool. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made this same Jesus that you crucified both Lord and Christ. Now, watch what Peter is telling them. HE IS THE FULFILLMENT OF MESSIANIC PROPHECIES. JAW KILLED HIM, BUT GOD RAISED HIM UP AND EXALTED HIM TO THE THRONE OF GOD. AND TODAY HE SITS THERE IN ALL supreme power in Ephesians 1:20. You can write them down if you want. 1:20. And he sat at the right hand in heavenly places. In Hebrews 12 and2, he sat down at the right hand on the throne of God. In Romans 8 and34, amen, Christ died, yet rather is risen again who is at the right hand of God. These men were driving a point. He's not in that tomb y'all put him in. God lifted him up bodily, raised him up and set him in heaven on the throne. In Hebrews chapter 1 and verse three, Paul has just said that sat down at the right hand. In Hebrews 8 and1, he sits on the right hand of the throne and majesty on high. Hebrews 10 and 12, he sat down on the right hand of God. 1 Peter chapter 3 22. He has gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God. And angels and authorities and powers are made subject unto him. My these boys had a revelation of who Jesus was, didn't they? Amen. Think of this. And Revelations 3, Jesus's own revelation written through John. To him that overcomemeth will I sit with me in my throne as I have overcome and have sat down with my father in his throne. &gt;&gt; So you can see that he was highly exalted and he was set down at the right hand of God with supreme authority and power over heaven in even the earth and things under the earth. Now let's walk to the next verse in Hebrews 1 and verse4. being made much better than the angels by as an inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. Listen to that. He came to the earth. They gave him the lowest name. &gt;&gt; But God gave him the greatest name. &gt;&gt; They gave him the lowest seat and God gave him the highest seat. He's the name which is exalted and nothing could stand before that name. For the fifth verse says, for unto which of the angels saith he at any time, Thou art my son, and this day I have begotten thee, and again, now here's another scripture. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. Now, Paul has put two Old Testament scriptures together here. And again, that's that's what he's doing. He's quoting one and then quoting another. Now, the word here today, I have begotten thee. In the Greek word, this is called monogenis. Uh, it's just spelled m o n o ge nees. I'm not a Greek theologian. To you visitors, uh, sorry, I'm southern and and and if I say it, it kind of sounds like Spanish, you know. See, that's why I don't joke. Now, Matt, we're counting on you, buddy. M O N O G E N E S monogenous. It's the only begotten or unique. &gt;&gt; In the Greek, it means one and only. &gt;&gt; Look what he says here. For which of the angels had he says at any time, &gt;&gt; you're my one and only? &gt;&gt; He's never said that to any angel &gt;&gt; that thou have been begotten. I am your father and you are my son. Look what he says here. It's the first uh prophecy used here in this uh uh Hebrews 1 and5. Pull it up. Psalms chapter 2 and verse 7. I hope y'all come with your Bibles today. Amen. Zach said I tied uh most of the Bible to Hebrews chapter 1 and 2. Well, I'm going to get the rest of it on Hebrews 2 4-14. Psalms chapter 2 verse 7. and I will declare the decree, the Lord hath said unto me, thou art my son, and this day have I begotten thee. Now, this is an Old Testament scholar. Paul is, and he's reaching into the Old Testament to identify this Jesus, who he really is according to David's prophecies, Jesus is the fulfillment. If you look for an answer to Psalms 2 and 7 outside of Jesus, you're going to be very discouraged. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And look then, and again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. So Paul again is quoting scripture. The scripture he's quoting is prophecy from 2 Samuel 7 13- 14. These are prophecies concerning Solomon, but not really. They're really concerning the son of David who would be the Messiah king over Jerusalem. And again, watch. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. Do y'all notice this is future tense? I will be to him &gt;&gt; and he shall be to me. Watch in 2 Samuel. Amen. He shall build a house for my name. I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be, this is again future tense, I will be his father and he shall be my son. Now, isn't it amazing because brother Brandham teaches us a very powerful lesson in the message and he said you hear these uh uh people going around religious people and he said they keep talking about the eternal son of God. He said there is no such thing as eternal son. &gt;&gt; BROTHER B MAKES A HUGE POINT ABOUT THIS. THERE IS NO ETERNAL SON BECAUSE AMEN. WHAT THEY'RE trying to do is to say that the son is one God out OF THREE GODS. &gt;&gt; BUT WATCH WHAT THE BIBLE IS SAYING. I will be his father and he shall be. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WAS NO ETERNAL SUNSHIP. THERE WAS NO SON FLESH at that time. BUT HE WAS PROPHESYING THAT I WILL HAVE A BEGOTTEN SON. Now what's this really saying? Brother Brandham says it like this. He said it's a revelation of how God was manifested in the human flesh and revealed to us. And that's why he becomes a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's why God becomes a son. Isn't that amazing? People say, "Well, Jesus was a man that become God." I say he was God to become man. &gt;&gt; Not a God, the God. &gt;&gt; Now, WATCH WHAT HE DOES. BROTHER B SAID, "THAT'S BECAUSE he becomes a son of God. He's a part of God." You understand the body is a part of God. A son, as the Catholic puts it, I was going to hide that. He didn't. As a Catholic puts it, eternal son. And all of the rest of the churches, the word didn't even make sense. There cannot be eternal and then be a son. A son is something THAT IS BEGOTTEN. NOW, WHAT WHAT WHAT Samuel and what Paul are putting together is the idea that this Jesus isn't a human being just becoming God or he isn't A PRE-EXISTENT son who has come down, but rather the God of heaven has became flesh AND MANIFESTED HIMSELF among the people. So Jesus did previously exist. Tell me knows that &gt;&gt; he pre previously existed as the offening in the beginning of John 1 and1. He calls him in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the same was IN THE BEGINNING WITH God and things were made by him and without him there was nothing made. So John is confirming what what was said here. Amen. In the first parts of HEBREW THAT JESUS WAS THE CREATOR. BROTHER BRANDON PUTS IT IN THE CHURCH AGE BOOK. HE SAID, "AND THE LORD CREATED THE heavens and earth in six days." And what do we call Jesus? The same Lord and Christ. He's letting you know he was a creator. But watch what he was. He was a word before his flesh. Now, we'll get into who's Melazdc later, but you can see the pattern in John chapter 1 and verse1 14. Some people say, "Well, by the way, John 1 and1 had nothing to do with Jesus." Watch the 14th verse. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. AMEN. AND WE BEHELD HIS GLORY AS THE GLORY of the be only begotten of the father full of grace and truth. And John bear witness and cried saying, "This is whom I spake. He that cometh after me is prepared before me. He was before me and the fullness we have all received and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth by JESUS CHRIST. FOR NO MAN HAS SEEN GOD AT ANY TIME. Only the begotten son which is in the bosom of the father hath declared him. He was telling them your INVISIBLE GOD HAS BECOME visible to you in the flesh of JESUS CHRIST. WHEN JESUS SAID, "AMEN. YOU SAY YOU WANT TO SEE THE FATHER. WHEN you see me, YOU HAVE SEEN THE FATHER &gt;&gt; because the father dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I I look at the beauty of this of the uniqueness. Jesus wasn't unique, folks. &gt;&gt; He was the only begotten son of God. If you're studying this area of the pre-existence of Christ, brother Bram calls it pre-incarnate Christ. So, so the word begotten is dealing with the incarnation of Jesus in human flesh. pre-incarnate. He meets Abraham. Amen. He he actually meets him as Elohim or as Melazdc. He was the word. But brother Brandham is very specific. He said, "Watch when God, the word wanted to meet Abraham before HE BECAME JESUS, HE PICKED UP the dirt and BLEW A BODY AND STEPPED INTO THAT BODY. THAT WAS NOT A BEGOTTEN BODY. &gt;&gt; THAT DIDN'T COME THROUGH HUMANITY. It was not a kinsman TO ABRAHAM. HE COULD NOT STICK AROUND AND BE ABRAHAM'S SAVIOR. HE JUST GAVE HIM PROMISES AND SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE COMING OF HIS PRIESTHOOD. But look at the beauty of this folks. He was not the begotten son. HE WAS GOD PRE-INCARNATE. And Moses saw him, saw the back parts, saw he was a man. But when Jesus came to the earth, he was called the unique or the only begotten son of God. Amen. He is so unique. He is the only one. Amen. That was God fully manifested in the flesh. In first John 1, I wished I had a lot of time. I could show you Hebrews 1. Brother Bam talks about it. And then again, Christ revealed in his own word and he says you see a lot of him in Moses. And he said Joseph's life was almost perfect. &gt;&gt; It takes a prophet to pick these things up. And he said Joseph's life was so perfect. He said it was almost like it was him. He said, "But God let him make that one mistake &gt;&gt; so you'd know it wasn't him." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, Brother Random, what you just said mean a lot to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. It was SO COLD. YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS HIM, BUT GOD LET HIM MAKE that mistake so you knew it wasn't him. &gt;&gt; Well, I hope you're updating that. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ram made that mistake. God let it happen so you know that wasn't him. &gt;&gt; He's just his messenger. &gt;&gt; He's the seventh angel. Amen. You see in John chapter 1, John tells it again, that which was from the beginning, which we heard, WHICH WE SEEN WITH OUR EYES, WHICH WE HAVE LOOKED UPON, and our hands have handled the word of life. For life was manifested, and we seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you the eternal life, which was the father. Amen. In John chapter 3 and verse 16 uses the same Greek word for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten. Amen. The one and only unique flesh son of God. Because Jesus, amen, was not a Jew. &gt;&gt; AS MANY THINK, WELL, WE WORSHIP A JEW. NO, WE DON'T worship a Jew and we don't worship a Gentile. Brother man told us we're worshiping God &gt;&gt; because the father's blood is what's in a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the blood that was in Jesus WAS MORE THAN JUST HUMAN BLOOD, FOLKS. It was the BLOOD OF GOD THROUGH A CREATIVE ACT HAD COME upon the face of the earth. Brother Bam said it like this. See, he was the second Adam. THE FIRST ADAM WAS GOD'S SON, but he was created. But Jesus was a begotten son because he had to come through a woman. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're looking in the Bible in Luke chapter 1, it tells how God got in the flesh. Now, if you like to study this, and I know some of your real studies, I know you get up early, Brother Guthrie, I know you, you know, you're pre-work guy and maybe an hour in the morning or something. Look into this powerful right here. Amen. Because what he's what he's telling us in the church age book, he's telling us how the serpent seed came into the flesh and gives the account of Genesis 3. Remember that the serpent seed came through Eve by the flesh. Amen. But then the Bible speaks of an imposing seed called the woman's seed. But we don't see how the woman seed comes into the flesh. Until you get in the New Testament AND IN THE BOOK OF LUKE, YOU'LL FIND in the 30th verse, IT SAYS HERE THAT MARY, A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL, IS WALKING ON HER WAY. BROTHER BRIM said she was thinking about the Lord and an angel stepped out to her and SAID, "BEHOLD, THOU SHALT CONCEIVE in thy womb and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus." Now, isn't that beautiful? Because Mary didn't come up with that name. That name was given to HER BECAUSE IT MEANT JEHOVAH'S elected salvation. JEHOVAH SAVES. AND GOD ALREADY HAD THAT NAME and it was given to her because it was the father's name. &gt;&gt; And he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord shall give him the throne of his father David. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob and the kingdom shall be no end. Then Mary said unto the angel, "How shall this be? saying, "I know not a man." Good question. Amen. And the angel answered, said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee, AND THOU HOLY things shall be born, shall be called the son of God." Isn't that beautiful? That's how God came into the flesh. You're reading the records that is the opposing record to what happened in the garden of Eden now happens in the earth to oppose it. So this woman's seed had to come according to the book of Jeremiah. It said a woman shall compass a man in the and and we find it here in Isaiah 7 and verse 14. Isaiah prophesied it and said, "The Lord himself shall give you a sign, and behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel." Now, if you think Jesus was just a man, it's amazing because when Joseph was excited about his uh newly espoused wife becoming expecting, and he had never been with her, they wasn't yet fully married. Amen. And the angel appeared to him and said, "Don't you fear to take her, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Now, now it was done according to scripture. Amen. The Bible said, "This was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel." Amen. Isn't it beautiful? In Luke 1 and verse 35, the Bible said, "The Holy Ghost shall be upon thee, and thou highest shall overshadow thee, and the holy thing WHICH SHALL BE BORN of thee shall be called the son of God." To which of the ANGELS DID HE EVER say that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he shall be called the son of God. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, folks, this is to me one of the greatest cases of the Christian religion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And seemingly the quickest fading subject among Christianity is the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If Jesus was not virgin born, then the whole Christian religion is a wreck. &gt;&gt; But I attest the idea that it was somehow Mary and Joseph OR IT WAS SOMEHOW MARY AND JUST A SPIRIT. I SAY THAT THE BLOOD of Jesus Christ came from God AND THE EGG ALSO came from God. AMEN. THERE WAS NOT AN IMMACULATE conception such as the Catholic Church will teach. Now I I don't want to get in Catholic doctrine but folks they teach Mary was virgin born herself. They called it the immaculate sinless heart of Mary and somehow she didn't come into the earth through sin desire. Amen. So that's the only reason she was favored to bring forth. And that ain't nothing but a lie. BECAUSE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID HAD MARY, HAD MARY NOT WENT TO THE upper room, SHE COULDN'T HAVE GOT INTO HEAVEN BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST AS SINFUL AS YOU AND I WERE SINFUL AND NEEDED THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. MARY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR SALVATION. SHE WAS AN INCUBATOR. SHE GAVE GOD A BODY THAT HE COULD USE TO BRING FORTH A SON. AND THAT SON SAVED the world. My goodness. Brother Bam says, "Amen. Life come from the bloodstream." And in this case, there was no male sex. Now, if you want to go back far enough, you can find this with Adam and Eve. When God created Adam, he created he them. &gt;&gt; Male and female. Don't tell me God couldn't put male and female in the womb of Mary. One time, Brother Bam said it like this. Is okay if I preach? I If you need the quote, I can give it to you. Brother Bam said it like this. He said, "You could have took that and put it on a stump and it would have brought life. Because it wasn't Mary or Joseph. It was the ETERNAL GOD CREATING A BODY TO COME INTO THE EARTH TO MANIFEST HIS GLORY AND his power. It was God. Paul says it in 1 Timothy 3:16. AMEN. WITHOUT CONTROVERSY, GREAT IS THIS MYSTERY. BUT GOD WAS MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; WOO! GLORY. GOD WAS MANIFESTED in the flesh. I love how Brother Brandham says it. Amen. He said, "Look at this." He and he quotes it OVER AND OVER. THAT GOD WAS IN CHRIST. THAT'S THE MYSTERY. THAT'S THE MYSTERY of God. You watch Brother Random tell it in the tomb of Gardia. It's a powerful story. And he builds up that tomb of Gardia and talks about that man Legion. You remember? And how Legion so troubled and he's so bound. And brother says, "But when Jesus got out of the boat, a little frail man, he said that Legion rose up in that man and said, "I'll go destroy this man. I'll go destroy this man they called Jesus. AND HE SAID WHEN THAT THING BEGAN to roar at him, he said Jesus finally lifted his head and looked into the eyes of Legion. He said LEGION SCREAMED OUT AND SAID, "WHAT are you doing in there?" Because he recognized THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE FRAIL MAN STANDING THERE. THERE WAS MORE THAN AN UNCUMBLY MAN STANDING THERE. THE GOD OF HEAVEN HAD COME DOWN IN THAT HUMAN BODY AND THAT DEVIL COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW DID THE GOD OF HEAVEN GET IN THAT BODY. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT. AMEN. A LOT OF PEOPLE don't know how God GOT IN THAT BODY. I'LL TELL YOU HOW HE GOT IN IT. HE OVERPOWERED and overshadowed. AMEN. MARY'S WOMB AND BROUGHT LIFE AND A BIRTH CAME FROM that body and it was called the son of God, begotten son of God. You know, the devil's still confused about that birth stuff cuz he don't even believe in that new birth cuz he THINKS THAT A CHILD of Abraham, Amen. That's why he he does all of his teachings and man does all their understandings. But I'll say this, DO YOU KNOW GOD has a new birth today that'll bring THAT SAME CREATOR AND put him right in your body &gt;&gt; and it's a mystery to the world and it's a mystery to others. But brother Bam SAID, "LOOK, IF YOU DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO PREACH," AND I KNOW EVERYBODY got something to preach now because we got a message, but back in that early years, Brother Bam said it. He said, "You don't have to wait till you get a great education to go preach the gospel." HE SAID, "GO TELL THEM HOW YOUR candle got lit. GO TELL THEM HOW GOD GOT IN YOU. GO TELL THEM THAT YOU WENT TO a service and you just WANTED TO REPENT AND GO TO AN ALTAR AND WHEN YOU KNELT DOWN, THE HOLY GHOST COME OVER TO YOU. AND WHEN I GOT UP, I WAS DIFFERENT." AMEN. I TELL YOU WHAT, SOMETIMES I THINK WE OUGHT TO BRING IT BACK TO REALITY THAT GOD CHANGES LIVES. That's what changes lives. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A BUNCH OF THERAPY THERAPIES AND PSYCHOLOGIES AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT DON'T CHANGE LIVES. &gt;&gt; I know it's old news to you, but but it's still the truth, folks. &gt;&gt; Amen. God was in Christ. Brother said God was in Christ reconciling the world. That blood cell being broken released God. It released God. If anybody would misinterpret Jesus in the Bible of not being God himself, then you would make it the second person or one God out of three, it would upset the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And most importantly, it would break the first commandment &gt;&gt; that thou shalt not have any god before me. It would make the whole Christian race a bunch of pagan worshippers by having different gods. I love how brother Bam says it. He says, "See, it can't be known intellectually. It must be known spiritually by a spiritual revelation." &gt;&gt; Now, here is the revelation. Thou that is a revelation. Jesus Christ is God. The Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New Testament. No matter how hard you try, you cannot prove there are three gods. &gt;&gt; It takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that there is one. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says, "I admit it takes a revelation to see it." Now, if you look at these scriptures, it's what Paul is doing here, and I I think it's amazing is Paul is calling Jesus unique &gt;&gt; because he's telling you that God came into this man. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just a man. He was a unique man. He was the head of a new race called a God man. &gt;&gt; Now the the the theologians up through the ages come up with a what they called a hypoatic union. How many remembers me using that term hypoatic union? It's a it's actually a theological term and you probably don't need to know it. You can just say a union. We could call it a H union if you want to. And uh but but it's a union. And the reason they developed it, brother Gabe, because they knew anytime you put two things together, it changes those two things. You you can't actually put two things together without changing it. But they called this a hypothatic union, saying that there was a union between God and Jesus that they could put man and God together and remain God and man. &gt;&gt; So if somebody says, "Well, Jesus was all God." Amen. But you but you can't make him less than man or you can't make him greater than man &gt;&gt; or you have removed that he's your kinsman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he was ALL GOD. BUT YOU GOT TO also recognize he was all man. &gt;&gt; And being all man made him your kinsman. &gt;&gt; He can't be your kinsman UNLESS HE FACED THE SAME TEMPTATIONS YOU FACED. UNLESS UNLESS EVERY PART OF YOU WAS REPRESENTED IN HIM BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID HE became me. &gt;&gt; Now watch the beauty of this. It's the only begotten. Now this is this is where this is where this is going to take another whole level because the implications of what Paul is saying here it really gets powerful in the next verse. Watch this in Hebrews 1 and6. And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith, "And let all the angels of God worship him." Oh my goodness. Here is Paul speaking to the Jews that their very first commandment is to have no other god before them. AND NOT ONLY IS PAUL OFFERING adoration and worship to this man, NOW HE'S SAYING GOD COMMANDED ANGELS to worship him. I'll tell you what. Amen. Now, it's a powerful thing. And and they say he's quoting Psalms 97:7. I'm not certain of that, but they confounded and serve graven images and boast themselves of idols. Worship him all you gods. Now, here's the here's the thing. He commanded angels to worship him. Now, brother Bam taught us something about the Godhead when he went back and Brother Bam said now before he was God, he said you got to watch the word God. He said he was actually Elohim, right? And and brother Bam said the reason he was called Elohim because he was self-existent. He said but he actually don't become God until after he creates angels &gt;&gt; because angels are created for the purpose to worship God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, now Brother Brandham would tell us this and and this is something this is for your refrigerator. &gt;&gt; But being that he was God, then there must be something to worship him because he loved worship. &gt;&gt; God loved worship. Have you ever thought about where worship comes from? Have you ever thought about the adorations and worship and the singing and the praising? Have y'all ever thought really where does that come from? H how did that get into the earth or into the world? It's because God loves worship and God was the one that created beings called angels. And those angels were specifically designed to worship God. Now there's a big point in this folks. If their design, brother Nathan, if the only purpose of the seraraphims and the angels, if their only purpose was to WORSHIP GOD, AND NOW PAUL IS SAYING THAT God commanded them to WORSHIP JESUS, &gt;&gt; HE'S TELLING YOU THE GOD THAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING HAS BEEN MANIFEST IN THIS MAN, JESUS. AND SO MUCH THAT EVEN the angels are going to worship him, &gt;&gt; the ones created to worship. I know. Amen. We get all kinds of ideas about worship. But you know, I think it's amazing that the creator himself, now there must have been some attribute in God that he would release that would create worship because these angels were designed for the purpose of worship. And and we see a a lot of places you don't catch a a glimpse of what's happening in heaven. But in the book of Isaiah, you actually get a door into the very throne of God in Isaiah chapter 6. In Isaiah 6 and1, Amen. The Bible said that Isaiah of course he goes down when Uzziah dies and Isaiah he says I also saw the Lord sitting on the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and above it stood saraphims. Each one had six wings and between he covered his face and between he covered his feet and between he did fly. Brother said if you want to know how to approach God there it is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said there that that that servant angel is teaching you how to approach the God of heaven. And he says, watch this. HE SAYS HIS TRAIN FILLED the temple and it stood there seraphims each one of them. Amen. They're covering his feet, covering his face and they did fly. AND THEY CRIED unto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory." He knew what the angels were saying. &gt;&gt; He was hearing the worship of those angels. Holy, holy, holy. Thou art a set aart God. Thou art a God apart from all else. He was worshiping this God. And in the sixth chapter, the fourth verse. Amen. Watch this significant point. AND THE POST OF THE door moved at THE VOICE OF HIM THAT CRIED. NOW, BROTHER BAM in the message of influence of another picks up this breaks into the vision of Isaiah and he SAID WHEN THEY SPOKE THE PILLARS OF THE building shook at their voice. He says they wasn't just saying now holy, holy, holy. He said what a voice. The pillars moved AND SHOOK AT THEIR VOICE. THEY WERE SCREAMING. THOSE ANGELIC beings standing next to the side of God AND WAS SCREAMING HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. AND THEY WERE SCREAMING SO LOUD TO GOD, HOLY UNTIL THE doors begin to shake. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? Some of these uh some of these cold theologians in this LAST DAY ACTS LIKE GOD IS SOMEHOW afraid of people worshiping loud WHEN THE VERY ONE HE CREATED IN HEAVEN WAS SCREAMING SO LOUD IT WAS SHAKEN. COME ON CHURCH. AMEN. GOD WAS THE ONE THAT CREATED THAT ANGEL. GOD IS THE ONE THAT ANOINTED HIM TO DO IT. BROTHER SAID THAT'S NOT JUST EXCITEMENT RAISING UP in these people. HE SAID, "IT'S THE HOLY GHOST MOVING THROUGH THEM, CAUSING THEM." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, glory be to God. SOMEBODY SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, I tell you what, I'm going to need more than that." All right. Revelations 5 11. And I beheld voice of angels round about the throne. That was the beginning. This is the end. and the beast and the elders and the number of them was 10 times 10 thousands of thousands saying with a &gt;&gt; same WITH A LOUD VOICE, WORTHY IS THE LAMB &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SLAIN TO RECEIVE POWER AND riches and wisdom and strength and honor and GLORY AND BLESSING. AND EVERY creature which is in heaven and on the sea and under the earth and such as were in the SEA HEARD I. SO NOT ONLY WERE them angels with a loud voice, BROTHER BAM SAID, WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOHN. HE GOT SO LOUD THAT THEY HEARD THEM. AMEN. In the heavens and in the earth and under the earth, they heard John hollering blessing and glory and honor and power to him that siteth onto the throne and the lamb forever more. What was this man so excited about? He done saw his name in the lamb's book of life. And this IS THE VERY THING THAT JESUS SAID, "REJOICE NOT THAT YOU HAVE power over THE DEVILS. BUT YOU REJOICE THAT YOUR NAME HAS WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE." BROTHER B SAID, "OH," HE SAID, I'VE SEEN THEM STAND AND SCREAM AND SHOUT AND REJOICE. HE SAID, "BUT SEE, THEY SAW THEIR NAMES ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE." YOU ASK ME WHY. AMEN. THAT WE'RE UNDIGNIFIED AND WE HAVE THIS LOUD WORSHIP AND WE HAVE SCREAMS AND HOWLERS AND HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE I HAVE SAW MY NAME ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. I'M GOING HOME, FOLKS. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEVILS CAN STOP ME. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEMONS CAN STOP ME. I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, I TELL YOU, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO JUST TELL THAT OLD, HEY, THAT OLD THAT OLD SKEPTICAL DEVIL, GET OUT OF MY WAY THIS MORNING, DEVIL. I COME TO WORSHIP GOD. I COME TO WORSHIP JESUS CHRIST. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO WORSHIP A PREACHER. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO WORSHIP JUST A SONG. I COME HERE TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF ABRAHAM. I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW HE'S MY SAVIOR. HE'S MY REDEEMER. HE'S MY HEALER. HE'S MY ALL AND ALL. I believe this morning we got a right to worship him. I believe we got a right to it, folks. Amen. So, well, by the way, I don't know. WELL, LISTEN. THEY THINK THAT SOUNDS PENTECOSTAL. WELL, LET ME SAY THIS. IF THEM UNSAVED, BACKSLID, DRUNKEN PENTECOSTALS, WOMEN BOBBED AND SMOKING. AMEN. A BUNCH OF ADULTERERS FOR PREACHERS PREACHING TRINITARIANISM. AND THEY CAN SHOUT AND REJOICE. WHAT ABOUT THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN THE SPOKEN WORD, THE REDEMPTIVE POWERS IN THE AGE? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. We're worshiping Jesus. WE'RE NOT JUST WORSHIPING SOME FIGMENT OF SOME IMAGINATION. WE ARE WORSHIPING OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; in the power of his glory AND THE POWER OF HIS SALVATION. &gt;&gt; They said, "Wow, it's getting awful noisy." Brother said, "If it's not a little noisy, it's a sign you're dead." &gt;&gt; And he ties that to the scripture and said, "When Aaron quit making noise behind the Holies of Holies, they had to drag him out cuz they knew he had died in the presence of God." Well, I don't want nobody dragging me out of the presence of God for a lack, amen, of worship in my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People get noisy. It's enough to make them noisy. He said, "I like a little noise." &gt;&gt; Now, it's going while you're making the noise. Now, now Jesus coming into the earth, I want you to watch this. When he comes into the earth, the angels show up. &gt;&gt; The angels themselves. Brother Bam goes through a great drama of how they were they were peeking over. &gt;&gt; What's it going to look like? &gt;&gt; Because they've they've been worshiping this this creation, this creator. They've been worshiping God, but now he was taking human form and they're they're peeking over the corridors knowing that God is coming into that human body. Amen. And they gathered into the earth and gathered the shepherds up. Amen. Brother Wy had to be shepherds. Amen. They gathered the shepherds up and angels begin to sing. Amen. At the birth of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WAS A FEW DAYS LATER, EIGHT DAYS LATER, CHRISTOPHER, THEY CARRIED THIS INFANT CHILD WHO HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BE BORN. &gt;&gt; EIGHT DAYS LATER, THEY BRING HIM IN AND THE TURTLE dove and and pigeon is their offering BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO POOR FOR A LAMB. EIGHT DAYS LATER, THIS OLD MAN SIMEON IS BACK THERE PRAYING AND GOD HAS BEEN TELLING HIM, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE OF OLD AGE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE LORD'S CHRIST." AND ON THAT MORNING, he got up and come. And brother Bam SAID HE WALKED RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THAT LINE of women holding them babies, waiting on their dedications. He said to that man, "Come right to Jesus." AND BROTHER, YOU talk about worship, the worship of a baby. HE HELD THAT CHILD UP AND BEGAN TO SAY, "THIS IS THE LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES. THIS IS UNTO THEM WHOM THEY'RE GOING TO TRUST." AND JUST ABOUT THE TIME ABOUT I bet Mary was having a fit. Can you imagine, Megan? You bring your kid for dedication and an old man rush and grabs it and puts it up into the heavens and said, "This is the light of the Gentiles." And she began to think herself, "Amen. Amen. Amen. That what that angel said and what happened to me, God's revealing to other people." And all OF A SUDDEN, ANNA, A BLIND WOMAN, AMEN, COMES RUNNING DOWN THERE AND FINDS THAT BABY 8 DAYS OLD AND BEGINS TO PROPHESY OVER THE CHILD AND LETS THEM KNOW THAT THIS IS THEM. THIS IS THE CHRIST. THIS IS THE ONE THEY'VE been looking for. Amen. It happens, folks. From the very birth of Jesus, creation began to testify of who he was. Watch what happens. The magis, brother said, is two years over on the other side in India. And he said, "The angel of the Lord," I love that quote. Hebrews series, "The angel of the Lord came down and appeared to them as a star and led them to him." &gt;&gt; And by the time they got there, he'd done been moving around, Kimberly. He'd done, Sister Kimberly, and they've been done moving him around, but that pillar fire knew right where the present truth was. &gt;&gt; And it led him to the house. The Bible said LED HIM TO THE HOUSE. and the Magi. Can you IMAGINE MARY AND JOSEPH and them AND THEY'RE IN THERE AND AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOUSE they're staying at, but they get a knock at THE DOOR AND SOMEBODY SAYS AND Joseph said, "Mary, come here. Come here. There's some important people out here. They got they got camels full. That looks like gold and frankincense and my and the magi tell us where you laid him." CAN YOU IMAGINE WHEN THEY STARTED unl the loads of gold and frankincense and myrr and starts anointing AND GIFTING THIS CHILD BECAUSE HE IS THE KING AND THEY HAVE SAW HIS SIGN AND THE BIBLE SAID AND THEY CAME TO worship him. &gt;&gt; OH A 2YEAR-OLD CHILD AND HERE THEY CAME TO WORSHIP HIM. HE WAS WORSHIPED IN THE HEAVENS AND NOW HE'S BEING WORSHIPED IN THE EARTH. NOW, HE'S BEEN TAKEN OFF OF THE EARTH AND SAT IN THE THRONE OF GOD. AND WE STILL WORSHIP HIM THIS MORNING BECAUSE HE IS NO OTHER THAN GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I I got I got a lot of scriptures on worship. I'm not going I'm not going to get them all to you. What you see is is you see a continuity is you see a continuity of these people moving toward him and his presence being recognized in the earth causes worship out of man. Do you know man is designed to worship God? &gt;&gt; That's why when brother said when they come here the Indians were worshiping the sun and they were worshiping the waters and the winds. He said, "You you you I've been to India. I watch you. They they go over and carve some little you you've seen them. They they carve little carvings and and I went to Mater, the greatest temple, the Hindu temple. I went right in the temple, been right there. And they have got stacks of gods about this tall. There's there's maybe 100,000 of them across the top of that. And they carved them with their own hands &gt;&gt; because they're so thirsty to worship something. But all they can worship is something they have designed with their own hands because they don't know that the God of heaven come down and took an image that they might worship him in the image of his son. But they worship them things. And brother Bam says it. See, see even in worship, even in a perverted worship, look how noisy they get. &gt;&gt; Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Worshiping the God of heaven and they think they're worshiping God while worshiping a idol or worshiping this or that because they're designed for worship. &gt;&gt; Now, now now this is now folks. I'm not against uh I'm not against quiet people. So you y'all have to be careful. It it uh is it I I don't want to say anything about anybody, but you know, I I've I've often seen uh that God God develops characters and he designs and worship is in your own dictates. So, don't take this sermon as I'm beating you up for being quiet. &gt;&gt; Actually, just realize this that we got some loud people and it seems like everybody beats up our loud people for worshiping. &gt;&gt; And I really am really disturbed by that. &gt;&gt; All right. I can take it and somebody gets a scripture wrong, but you you start preaching against people worshiping God and you got a real problem with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you can read. If you can worship God, worship him. That's right. &gt;&gt; So now we we have we have so watered down the gospel of Jesus Christ that now salvation and the great miracles of God just come and shake my hand or come and hear me speak. &gt;&gt; That's what it's been reduced to. &gt;&gt; It isn't it? It it I read I read a prophet. Y'all y'all have to forgive me because I told my wife one time and I'm probably getting too open here, but I told my wife one time, I said I I I think I was a better listener of ministry before I before I listen to brother Brandham because now I listen to brother Brandham so much. I know when someone's taking and hijacking his quotes to take it a direction they want. &gt;&gt; Because I I I'm different in listen and I think this would be good for you. Don't just take a quote of a prophet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Listen to the tape. &gt;&gt; Listen to what William Brandham believed. &gt;&gt; See, he said, listen, I will stand someday in the judgment and I will have to answer, but I will never answer to a creed. So help me God, I will answer to this Bible, and this is the book I stand by. There is no place in this Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without without having emotions &gt;&gt; speaking with tongues or shouting or praising God or prophecies or manifestations. They never did just walk up and shake hands with a preacher and walk away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And there is no place in the Bible they ever did receive or was baptized outside of being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And there was no place in the Bible it ever taught trinity. It taught one God. Amen. Do do you see what a prophet is saying? He's not answering to man's creeds. WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY? &gt;&gt; WATCH. BROTHER BRAM SAYS IT LIKE THIS. HE SAID, WATCH WHAT PAUL WAS SAYING. HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, FUNDAMENTAL. He says, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS but denying the power of it &gt;&gt; from such turn away. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S THAT'S powerful to me, folks. &gt;&gt; I Some people sit and listen to nonsense till they can't even hardly get liberty in church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody's somebody's wicked words weigh so heavy on their minds that they can't even get liberty anymore. I tell you what you ought to do is turn off that nonsense and start listening to the word of God. &gt;&gt; A prophet OF THIS AGE WAS SENT to bring liberty to you. He'd come to give liberty to this church of the living God. Listen, I I I tell you, I'm reading a prophet right here. He said, "FROM SUCH, TURN AWAY." And I did, and I become a holy roller. Hallelujah. And when THE WIND GOES TO BLOWING, I get into it and say, "Yes, Lord. I believe you're the same yesterday and forever." YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IN the sermon, why I am a holy roller. How many ever heard it? &gt;&gt; Why I am a holy roller? He said, "You can't just start in the middle. You got to go back back and find out what's going on." in him. Brother Brandham took why I'm a holy roller and went to the book of Genesis and divided the worship between Cain and Abel and brought two vines out of Genesis and he BROUGHT THE FROM GENESIS of Cain and Abel. He then he brings them to Moses and Balum. AND HE SAID THERE'S TWO VINES THERE. THERE'S THE FUNDAMENTAL AND there's the spiritual. AND BROTHER BRANDON WAS VERY CLEAR. HE SAID BALUM AND MOSES HAD THE SAME FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES. HE SAID, "BUT ONE OF THEM DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPERNATURAL AMONG THEM." OH, church of the living God. Amen. Listen, you can be as fundamental AS YOU WANT TO, BUT WHEN YOU THROW THE HOLY GHOST OUT, LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE GOT. YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING BUT A BAIL AND BALUM ASSEMBLY THAT IS REFUSING THE MOVING OF THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. AND BY THE GRACE OF GOD, AMEN. WE'LL MAKE ROOM FOR IT IN TRUE EARTH TABERNACLE. WE'LL MAKE ROOM FOR THE HOLY GHOST TO COME INTO THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW, if you want to if you want to take it, I I'd say, Brother Bam, don't end it there. He carries it over to his own experience and carries it over to the standing up on the mountain. How many ever heard him tell it? And he said, "I found myself in that dead forest." And he said, "Them big tall trees that once stood there so saintly." He said, "And the wind blew through them." He said, "But when the wind hit them, they said days of miracles had passed. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in that Holy Ghost no more." He, that's what he, Brother Bam, actually says, "The trees responded to the wind." And the way they responded was they felt the wind, but they rebuked the wind by saying, "I don't believe it. That's not from God. That's not that way." He said, "But then," he said, "I almost gave up on the idea." He said, "But then I looked down and saw them little trees coming up among them." And he said, "And when the wind started blowing," he said, "them little fellas," he said, "they were so flexible." He said, "They just moved under that." Now, Brother Bam says, "Watch this now. Same trees." &gt;&gt; See what he does? Fundamental. Moses and Balum, same trees. Men are called trees in the Bible. Same kind of trees. THEY WERE BOTH THE same trees, &gt;&gt; BUT ONE WAS LIVING AND ONE WAS DEAD. ONE WAS FLEXIBLE AND ONE WAS UNMOVING. I SAY, GOD, LET A REVIVAL SWEEP INTO OUR GENERATION SINCE THAT'S COMING ON. LISTEN, WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE HAD A GREAT REVIVAL. BROTHER brother brother A and I Amen. We've shouted our heels off. First time I ever met him, Amen. was well I think we'd preach maybe one or two times and you had me stay the night with you down there and I remember coming out of the upstairs and it was late in the night and I heard a little something so I come off the upstairs and when I come down I looked over there in the corner and brother Ray was up on the prayer meeting there and he was speaking in the other known tongue and and man he was just having himself a prayer meeting well I tell you what I didn't do I didn't turn around and run back up the room say I can't believe there's a tongue talker in this house I went down there and put my arm around him and the next thing you know I was talking in tongues with him. Amen. And and that's when we really fell in love. I I fell in love with a man. I said, "This guy right here, he's met the same kind of God I met." And I COME TO THIS TABERNACLE AND I REMEMBER THE ATMOSPHERE AND HOW THE BROTHER BEN OR BROTHER BRIAN, ONE OF THEM WOULD START LEADING SONGS AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD WOULD START MOVING AND THE POWER OF GOD, THE ATMOSPHERE EVEN BEFORE THE WORD WAS EVER SPOKEN, CREATING A PLACE AND AND THE POWER WAS THERE. AMEN. AND I SAY, GOD, DON'T NEVER DON'T LET IT DIE. DON'T NEVER LET THAT REVIVAL GO OUT OF OUR MIDST. AMEN. LISTEN, FOLKS. STAY ALIVE. STAY ALIVE IN THE POWER OF GOD. I DON'T CARE WHAT THESE BUNCH OF DOCTORS OF DIVINITIES HAS TO SAY. THE POWER OF GOD IS JUST AS REAL THIS MORNING AS IT EVER WAS. WE NEED A NEW BIRTH LIKE WE ALWAYS NEEDED NEW BIRTH. WE NEED experiences from God just like we always did. Why do they call William Brandham a holy roller? Well, I tell you what. Amen. They called him a holy roller cuz HE GOT AMONG THAT CROWD that shouted and spoke with tongues and believed in prayer and believed in miracles AND BELIEVED IN SUPERNATURALS. THEY LITERALLY COULD FEEL THE SPIRIT OF GOD. BROTHER MAN SAID, "I'M GLAD I'M ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE THAT CAN FEEL THE SPIRIT OF GOD." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; And and so so because you preach this way, then there's somebody that says, "Well, Brother Wayne, because I'm quiet, do you think I'm out of out of place?" I don't know if y'all have ever noticed, my wife is not the loudest person in our church. &gt;&gt; But I'll say this, she's one of the most spiritual people in this church. I live with her and I know I've never seen a more solid spiritual person and loves to see the spirit of God move. She asked to be in that prayer line. She asked for the job up there up top cuz she said, "I want to see God moving on them young people. I want to watch the presence of God as it baptizes them and as it move them." There's nothing denying. Amen. You just because somebody's quiet don't mean they deny the moving of the spirit. Amen. It's that old nasty spirit. YOU KNOW THAT OLD NASTY SPIRIT that gets on PEOPLE AND THEY START TALKING BAD ABOUT the moving of God and the prayer lines and the moving of the spirit and WHAT IT IS. AND AIN'T NOTHING BUT AN UNBELIEVING DEVIL AND COME OUT OF THE PITS OF HELL. AND I REBUKE IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. WE WILL HAVE LIBERTY IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. WE INVITE THE PRESENCE OF GOD. WE INVITE THE TRUTH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH. CALL ME A HOLY ROLLER IF YOU WANT TO. BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS HOLY ROLLER IS GOING TO BE IN A RAPTURE. BETHANY, I'M JUST WARMING UP FOR that meeting. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT it is. SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL, WELL, WHY DOES PEOPLE TALK SO bad about why why does people talk so bad?" Do y'all know why? Y'all know what really is? It's taking the worship away from Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you know? And how many was here when I taught in the book of Revelations and I went through Revelations 13, Revelation 17, that Rome trip we took, brother Seth? And remember I broke down that the that from 303 they made uh Christianity illegal and the pagans crucified and killed Christians for 10 years. &gt;&gt; 303 to 313. &gt;&gt; But in 313 then Constantine made Christianity legal. &gt;&gt; Right? But in 3:25 they had Nika council. And then in IA council they forbid anyone to to to worship outside of that Catholic trinitarian doctrine that they formed of trinitarianism. And they begin to label anybody that didn't get under their idea as a heretic. &gt;&gt; That's what they did. They said, "You're a heretic." And then in 380 in the edict of Thessanica, they then made a law that if you wasn't baptized under Trinitarianism that they could kill you for it. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to label you a heretic and then I'm going to KILL YOU FOR YOUR HERESY. &gt;&gt; Now they're doing the same thing spiritually today. &gt;&gt; They folks GET TOGETHER AND DECIDE HOW THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED to worship and how we're supposed to do this and how we're DOING THAT. AND WE ARE DOING IT EXACTLY LIKE A PROPHET taught it. That's right. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT IF ONE CAN LABEL YOU A HERETIC, THEN they can murder the influence of your ministry OR OF YOUR CHURCH AND THEY MURDER ANYTHING THAT'S NOT FIT IN THEIR LITTLE BOX THAT THEY'VE GOT SET ASIDE FOR RELIGION. WELL, I TELL YOU THIS, YOU CAN PERSECUTE HER. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HER. YOU CAN THROW THINGS AT HER, BUT YOU'LL NEVER STOP HER. THIS CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD IS GOING TO WORSHIP GOD IN THE PRESENCE, AND PAUL SAID, "THE WAY YOU CALL HERESY IS THE WAY I WORSHIP THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS. BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I WORSHIP JESUS CHRIST, I AM NOT WORSHIPING JUST A HEBREW. I'M NOT WORSHIPING A JEW OR JUST A MAN. BUT THAT WAS GOD COMING INTO THAT MAN. NOW HE'S ASCENDED ON HIGH AND SENT BACK THE HOLY GHOST. SO IS THAT YOU AND I COULD SIT HERE IN THIS CHURCH THIS MORNING. AND WHEN WE FEEL THAT PRESENCE OF GOD COMING INTO THIS ROOM, WE KNOW THAT HIS PRESENCE MAKING KNOWN TO YOU AND I THAT HE'S HERE WITH US. AND I'LL tell you this, when he begins to move, I believe the church are to open up their hearts, they are to say, "LORD, THIS IS YOUR CHURCH. This is your house. We have invited you to come and Lord, we're going to welcome you." &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this scripture right here. I want to show you what Brother Bam titles it in Psalms chapter. I was going to close anyhow, but he put it back on my heart. In Psalms 2:12, I want you to watch this. We just quoted Psalms 2 earlier, but 2:12, I want you to watch this scripture. Kiss the son lest he be angry and perish from the way when his wrath is kindled up a little bit. Kiss the son. That's an Old Testament prophecy that when God sends his son, begotten son, that they were to kiss him. And brother Brandham takes this scripture to tell you what was wrong at Simon Pharisees house. &gt;&gt; And he said when Jesus come in the door, he said they never kissed him. &gt;&gt; They they rejected &gt;&gt; they rejected him. Brother Bam said there it is. I imagine he was miserable sitting there. The Pharisees testing over testifying over there about different things. And poor Jesus sat there with dirty feet, an unaned face, no kiss. Jesus wants to be kissed. There's a scripture in Psalms 2 said, "Kiss the son." You'll never know what it means to once you've kissed him. Kiss that son and make him welcome in your heart. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it like this. He said they sat there. He said, you said, one of them says, "Well, I got a PhD and I don't care what you got. If you got a stony heart, you better worship him while you can. &gt;&gt; Kiss the son while you can. That's right. &gt;&gt; Unless he be angry. &gt;&gt; I think it's I think I think we can kiss the sun. You How do I do that today? Open up your heart &gt;&gt; and know when you're worshiping. &gt;&gt; This is not this is not fanaticism. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is not somebody worshiping creed. &gt;&gt; This is not some man-made doctrine. This is God &gt;&gt; in his present truth. Could you stand with me this morning &gt;&gt; worship? There's a lot on it. God created worship &gt;&gt; because God loves God loves worship. &gt;&gt; I just sat there and thought about it this morning. I I was just sitting thinking, where did worship even come from? God loves worship. &gt;&gt; God created angels to worship and he put something within man to worship. But gave you never seen no cat build a church. There's no dogs. There's no dogs ever went out there and piled up some stones, knelt down and prayed. But there's something about a man. &gt;&gt; Even on a lonely mountain, Abraham built an altar. Who taught him how to build that altar? You ever think about it? But something within the man. &gt;&gt; Something wanted to worship. &gt;&gt; He wanted to worship God. There's something within your hearts. That's why you It's why you do and why you come and why you give and why you put your days aside and say there's something in you want to worship &gt;&gt; something want you I want to worship God. Sometimes sometimes that that that's just a sometimes believe how that's just a secret place in your home, you know, where you you move something out and you just get on your knees there. There's something about that, isn't it? Bowing your knee. There's something there's something about that because that was the thing the Hebrew children refused. They refused to bow their knee to another God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you pray for me and you say, "God, why is our pastor so so rough?" He He about bowing to other men's teachings on worship. Why is he all right? &gt;&gt; Look back at my inheritance. Look, look back at my heritage and see if every man of God that ever lived refused to bow his knee &gt;&gt; to another God. &gt;&gt; Do y'all Do y'all recognize that worship is hearing the word as well? &gt;&gt; Do you know Satan displaced God from Eve and became Eve's God? because she listened to one word. &gt;&gt; Careful what you listen to, folks. &gt;&gt; It ain't because your pastor's going to get on to you. Don't you displace the God of Abraham &gt;&gt; and allow some other some other thought &gt;&gt; or some other being to extract your worship that belongs to him. &gt;&gt; There's something in you. There's something in you that wants to worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he made a way &gt;&gt; that you could worship him. &gt;&gt; He's anointed us to be here in this assembly. &gt;&gt; When I took the pastorship, I got somewhere privately and I told the Lord, "Lord, I'll do this, but only if you promise to be with me. And if you promise to be here with me, I promise to keep the channel open for you to move within your people." Praise. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you this morning, I'm not ever going to get in your way. &gt;&gt; So if something else is in your way this morning from worship him, want you just lay it aside right now. &gt;&gt; If there's something in your mind, some feeling, some situation, and it's taking the glory and the worship away from my Lord Jesus, want you to set it aside this morning. Say, "Lord, I repent. I want to worship you. &gt;&gt; I want to worship you with all my heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ben, you got something? I want to worship you more. We are a moment.
