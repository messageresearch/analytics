[4:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just bless his name this morning.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, we bless your nameless.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're worthy of all the praise
[4:18] and the honor that we could give to you
[4:20] this morning.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the high and the lofty
[4:24] one.
[4:26] Lord, you're so lifted among us this
[4:29] morning as savior and redeemer.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have our God, our Lord, our
[4:36] savior, our healer. You're the counselor
[4:39] of our lives, Lord. You're the the very
[4:42] leadership of our hearts. We thank you
[4:45] for your presence here this morning. and
[4:47] we we give you a a space here today,
[4:50] Lord, to come and speak through your
[4:53] word and bless your children, Lord, as
[4:56] they bless you. Now, Father, we ask you
[4:59] for your grace on this meeting, Lord, as
[5:02] as we would enter into this word. We ask
[5:05] you that you would come, that you would
[5:07] take this word, that you would use it
[5:09] for your glory, that you would speak to
[5:11] the heart and the need of your children.
[5:14] We ask it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[5:16] We pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless
[5:21] you this morning. What a wonderful
[5:23] morning to serve the Lord and to be in
[5:25] the house of God. And like to welcome
[5:27] everyone here today, our visitors that
[5:29] are here. May God bless you. And amen.
[5:31] If you're new here, Amen. We have a we
[5:34] have a rule. It's liberty. Just love the
[5:37] Lord with all your heart. And Amen. And
[5:39] if you love him and praise him, that's
[5:41] exactly what we're going to do. Amen.
[5:44] This morning, I I I have it on my heart
[5:45] to speak to you. I know my my voice may
[5:48] be just a little bit weak, but that's
[5:50] all right. So, you just pray and pull
[5:53] and it'll be real easy and then it'll
[5:55] just come good, you know. And so, uh,
[5:57] but I just have a few things on our
[5:59] heart. I'm going to pull out of the
[6:00] series that we've been on for this
[6:01] morning. It, uh, it just some
[6:03] inspiration came and and, uh, so, uh,
[6:06] series interrupted by inspiration. So,
[6:09] Amen. So, if it's okay with y'all, I'll
[6:10] just follow the Lord. Amen. Amen. I like
[6:13] it real good when when we give him the
[6:16] right away. Amen. I want to read from
[6:18] First John chapter 5 and verse 4.
[6:21] Amen.
[6:24] First John chapter 5 and verse 4.
[6:29] This is actually Brother Bram's text
[6:30] from the message uh that faith is our
[6:33] victory.
[6:35] I've been studying that tape a lot
[6:36] lately. Another tape we've been really
[6:38] going through is the faith in action.
[6:41] Wonderful tapes. Uh also why Christ
[6:44] speak another wonderful tape. Amen. But
[6:47] but here from the scripture for
[6:50] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[6:54] world.
[6:56] Now brother's going to make a big point
[6:58] in this sermon
[7:00] uh that faith overcomes. And he starts
[7:02] naming a lot of stuff. And he comes down
[7:04] and said, "But but you know, uh, John
[7:07] lived in a different time than we did."
[7:09] And he says, "And my situation's not
[7:11] named." He said, "But see when he said
[7:13] overcomemeth the world,
[7:15] &gt;&gt; he he covered the whole thing."
[7:18] &gt;&gt; So faith overcomes anything
[7:20] &gt;&gt; that comes from the world.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; And this is the victory that
[7:24] overcomemeth the world, even our faith.
[7:28] Let's also look at Philippians chapter 3
[7:32] and verse 14.
[7:36] Philippians 3 and verse 14.
[7:44] For I press toward the mark for the
[7:47] prize
[7:49] of the high calling. I like that. Don't
[7:51] you? There's a lot of callings, but
[7:53] there's a high calling
[7:56] &gt;&gt; of God in Christ Jesus. May God bless
[7:59] his words. You could be seated this
[8:00] morning.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; You know, it depends on what you plan to
[8:07] do with your life.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; How you approach everything in your
[8:14] life.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; So this morning, I'd like to talk to you
[8:18] a little bit about spiritual ambition.
[8:22] Usually uh ambition is a word used with
[8:25] a negative connotation. But this morning
[8:28] I'd like to take the positive
[8:29] connotation and talk to you about the
[8:31] positive side of spiritual ambition.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; You know because of your natural birth,
[8:39] the way you were born into this earth,
[8:41] Satan took a claim on you when you were
[8:44] born through your fall through your your
[8:47] actual birth. And the Bible said that we
[8:50] all come in to sin,
[8:52] &gt;&gt; right? Born in sin,
[8:54] &gt;&gt; shaped in sin.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; And Paul said when we come into the
[8:57] world, he said everyone everyone fell
[9:00] short of the glory of God. That's
[9:01] &gt;&gt; right. and through your human birth and
[9:04] through the the coming into this earth,
[9:06] there's all kinds of things mixed into
[9:08] you that Satan uh maybe has took claims
[9:11] upon and he's told you that that you
[9:13] know maybe you've reached the highest
[9:15] points you could reach as a Christian or
[9:17] as believer uh whatever gifts you have
[9:19] in your life he but but you know before
[9:22] you were born here if you were a
[9:26] Christian a son of God we speak about
[9:29] eternal life and one thing about eternal
[9:31] life we can we can recognize quickly is
[9:34] eternal life has no beginning so it has
[9:37] no ending.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; So you you didn't become a son or
[9:41] daughter of God on the day that you were
[9:44] saved here at the church but you were a
[9:47] son of God before the foundations of the
[9:50] world.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; And according to the Bible that we so so
[9:53] believe that is an inherent word of God
[9:56] unfailing word. It said that your name
[10:00] was put on the lamb's book of life
[10:02] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; So before there was a devil, God already
[10:08] took a claim to your life to fulfill
[10:12] something that would be in his own
[10:14] desire. So when Satan says to you that
[10:16] you've reached your limit or that you've
[10:18] come as far as you can come or that this
[10:21] this there's no really no use in trying
[10:23] because you'll never outgrow a certain
[10:26] area in your life. There'll never be an
[10:28] ability to reach beyond whatever he's
[10:30] saying. I want you to know that God had
[10:32] first claimed
[10:33] &gt;&gt; that God first claimed your life for
[10:36] something he desired for a purpose that
[10:39] he has. Amen. So it's not what you were
[10:42] born into. It's what's born in you.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; It's not the family that you come from.
[10:48] It's not the church you were born in.
[10:50] It's not the the situation. Cuz some
[10:52] people come from very poor beginnings.
[10:54] They come from maybe
[10:57] illegitimate births. And you know,
[10:58] that's a big deal. I know with some
[11:00] people they worry a lot about that. But
[11:02] you know, I I I I I thank God uh for a
[11:05] message and and and and sister Dalton
[11:07] asked Brother Bham about it one time
[11:09] because of something he said in in the
[11:11] sermon and and she went to Brother Bam.
[11:13] She said, "Brother Bam, what about uh
[11:15] the illegitimate birth?" And brother Bam
[11:17] said, "Well, let me explain that for
[11:19] you." He said, "We were all illegitimate
[11:21] through Adam,
[11:22] &gt;&gt; but our second birth made us legitimate
[11:25] sons through Jesus Christ." So you you
[11:28] know uh it really doesn't matter what
[11:31] you're born that that's one of the
[11:32] beautiful things I found about the
[11:33] gospel of Jesus Christ when uh one some
[11:36] of the first trips I ever made to India.
[11:37] I didn't know much about the Hindu
[11:39] religion other than it was a
[11:40] reincarnation. They believed in
[11:42] reincarnation but you know they got
[11:43] steps of life and and and and it's
[11:46] according to how you live in one life
[11:48] and you can be born after you die you're
[11:50] birthed back into the next life. If
[11:52] you're good you go down if you're bad or
[11:54] if you're good you go up. If you're bad
[11:55] you go down. And sometimes it can take a
[11:57] reincarnation of up to 13 times I think
[12:00] to make the highest level of what they
[12:02] would call life. But you see the re
[12:05] realization of the gospel of Jesus
[12:08] Christ is that one new birth.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can make you the highest creature
[12:13] in God's creation.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Now we know that because the Bible tells
[12:17] us that when God created Adam and Eve,
[12:19] he quit creating after that.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; And someone tell you why did God quit
[12:23] creating after he created Adam? because
[12:25] he had reached perfection in that he had
[12:28] created a man in his own image. So when
[12:31] Adam fell, he didn't fall from being a
[12:33] man. He fell from being a God. So that
[12:36] when Jesus came and and and died and
[12:38] buried and resurrected and set on the
[12:41] throne of God and offered back a new
[12:43] birth to the church by one new birth, it
[12:45] sets us back in the image of God, which
[12:48] is the highest order of God's kingdom.
[12:50] So, so you you it's not a a a birth and
[12:53] a death and a birth and a death. Amen.
[12:56] It's one new birth. Amen. That's one of
[12:57] the great mysteries of Hebrews the 6th
[12:59] chapter. When people say, "Well, you
[13:01] know, uh I was a Christian and I
[13:03] committed a wrong and and and I'm
[13:05] wondering if I blasphemed the Holy Ghost
[13:07] and I might not ever be able to be saved
[13:09] again." What a what a lie. The enemy
[13:11] took God's scripture and lied on that.
[13:13] Amen. And made people believe that. But
[13:15] that scripture in Hebrews 6 actually is
[13:18] saying that if a man is ever born again
[13:21] that he could never fall so far
[13:23] backwards that he needs to be reborn
[13:25] again.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Because once you are born of God, amen,
[13:29] there is now no way for that person to
[13:32] disbelieve to the place, Amen, that he
[13:35] would have to have a new birth again
[13:37] because the Bible said you were sealed
[13:39] until the day of your redemption. Now,
[13:41] now just because you're sealed under the
[13:43] day of redemption doesn't mean you're a
[13:45] finished work in as far as in your
[13:48] character or your growth. You're a
[13:49] finished work in your salvation. You're
[13:51] a perfect person in your soul. Amen. I I
[13:54] know these little babies around here, a
[13:56] lot of them are perfect little babies
[13:57] and they're they're sealed up human
[13:59] beings. They're full life human being.
[14:01] Perfect little babies, but they're not
[14:03] perfect adults. Amen. But but you got to
[14:05] you got to continue growth. And as a
[14:07] Christian, when you're born again, there
[14:09] is a continuing of your growth in
[14:11] Christian life. And and if you're at an
[14:14] adolescence in Christianity, Amen. I
[14:16] know how it comes in adolescence of
[14:18] life. You know, we'll never get through
[14:19] this stage. You know, you're you're old
[14:21] enough to want to and young enough to
[14:22] not be able to. You know, you you want
[14:24] to go, but you can't drive. You know,
[14:26] there's all them ages. But listen, just
[14:28] hold on. You'll get all that
[14:29] responsibility soon enough because
[14:32] you're going to grow into that. AMEN. A
[14:34] AND WE FIND OUT HERE, AMEN, that what's
[14:36] really you're looking AT IS THAT GOD HAS
[14:38] put a seed of greatness inside of every
[14:41] believer that he calls. Now, the Satan
[14:44] has tried to limit that to your gene
[14:46] pool or to your beginnings or how you
[14:48] come. But but the new birth, amen,
[14:51] brought you into a different kingdom
[14:52] under a different father with a
[14:54] different genetics. And it's a seed of
[14:56] greatness. And the lineage of this
[14:58] church is the lineage of David and
[15:00] Joshua and Jesus and Paul and Peter. Our
[15:04] lineage is a lineage of greatness of
[15:06] great men that lived that were real men
[15:08] like Irene that could be burned at a
[15:10] stake and amen and stand there and take
[15:12] the punishment because amen they were
[15:15] they were men. They wasn't just a they
[15:17] wasn't just a a male. They were real men
[15:19] that held on to the word of God. And and
[15:22] you see then then your circumstances of
[15:24] your birth is not the limitations to
[15:27] what God can do with you as a believer.
[15:29] Now I certainly believe that brother
[15:31] Bham preached here ye him many times.
[15:33] And if you like to hear the sermon here
[15:35] ye him, it's brother Bham's uh
[15:37] explanation of spiritual adoption. And
[15:40] in this sermon he always details that
[15:43] Jesus went to the went to the Jordan and
[15:45] was baptized and the spirit of God came
[15:48] into him. And then he says, "Then he
[15:50] went to mount transfiguration where the
[15:53] spirit of God overshadowed him and said,
[15:54] "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him."
[15:57] So he showed that there's a birth and
[15:59] then there's a a placing or a maturing
[16:02] of your life at which which he was
[16:04] calling adoption. Now, brother Bam
[16:06] wasn't trying to bring a new doctrine.
[16:08] He was just trying to tell the
[16:09] Pentecostals, you've got the Holy Ghost,
[16:11] but if you turn down the word, you're
[16:13] not going no further. You you can you
[16:15] can have the Holy Ghost, but if you
[16:17] don't turn if you don't continue in the
[16:20] word of God, then you are limiting
[16:23] yourself to whatever organization or
[16:25] whatever your teachers have taught you
[16:27] or whatever's happened. But see, when
[16:29] God birthed a son, BROTHER MADAM SAYS IT
[16:32] SAY, "WELL, brother Wayne, we were
[16:33] always sons. We were always sons, but
[16:35] you had to be born,
[16:37] &gt;&gt; right? To have fellowship, you had to
[16:39] have a birth. And then when you were
[16:41] birthed, God, brother Ram picks up the
[16:43] Old Testament and does a beautiful thing
[16:45] and he says God sends a a tutor to the
[16:48] church the same as a father put a tutor
[16:50] over a son. You know, he taught him in
[16:53] the ways of the business of the father
[16:54] until the boy could come to a place that
[16:57] he thought like dad, talked like dad,
[16:58] act like dad and and made decisions like
[17:01] dad and then he received a checkbook
[17:03] authority because his character and his
[17:05] father's character was the same
[17:07] character,
[17:09] &gt;&gt; right? And that is the goal of the
[17:11] church is that God would send the Holy
[17:14] Ghost among us and that it would nurture
[17:16] the church into the stature of the
[17:19] fullness of Christ. WHAT WHAT GOD SAW
[17:21] about you. Don't you set your ambitions
[17:23] down there on just church joining. Don't
[17:25] don't you set your ambitions just to the
[17:28] place I joined THE CHURCH OR I GOT the
[17:30] baptism of the spirit or amen or I you
[17:32] know I had an experience with God or had
[17:34] this. We're we're looking for something
[17:36] far greater than that. We're we're
[17:38] looking for that position that God has
[17:41] anointed you to become. He He He has a
[17:44] mind and he has a purpose for every life
[17:46] sitting here. AND HE SENT THAT HOLY
[17:48] GHOST TO transform you from whatever you
[17:51] were to what you're GOING TO BE. AMEN.
[17:53] LISTEN, GOD IS WORKING ON THE church of
[17:55] the living God. AND HE SENT THE HOLY
[17:57] GHOST TO DO IT. SO I DON'T believe in
[18:00] just man-made, Amen. pumping into the
[18:02] church. You need to be this. So you
[18:04] know, you get real hard on the people.
[18:06] So they start navigating that way.
[18:08] That's not it. It's got to be a birth.
[18:10] AND OUT OF THAT birth comes reality. I I
[18:13] I I need character. I need love. I need
[18:15] patience. I NEED I NEED something to
[18:17] help me deal with this temper. I I NEED
[18:20] SOMETHING, GOD. WELL, THAT AIN'T coming
[18:21] from the outside. No more than a than a
[18:24] oak tree is reaching to the outside for
[18:27] a leaf. It brings the leaf from within
[18:29] it through the life that's on the
[18:31] inside. And every believer sitting here,
[18:34] Amen. The very moment you receive the
[18:36] Holy Ghost, you receive something that
[18:38] will take you from the birth all the way
[18:41] to the changing of your body, YOU WILL
[18:43] NOT RECEIVE A DIFFERENT LIFE. There will
[18:45] not be two comingings of THE SPIRIT, BUT
[18:47] THERE will be a maturing of the spirit
[18:49] that you have and it will come to the
[18:52] place that ONE OF THESE DAYS THAT YOU
[18:54] CAN GET SO FAR OUT OF THE WAY UNTIL
[18:56] DEITY CAN SPEAK through you and deity
[18:59] can use your HANDS AND YOUR EYES AND
[19:01] YOUR LEGS. YOUR CALLING IS NOT A CHURCH.
[19:04] YOUR CALLING IS TO BE A MATE TO JESUS
[19:07] CHRIST AND A SHARING OF EVERY OF EVERY
[19:10] EVERY PROMISE THAT GOD HAS MADE TO THIS
[19:13] GENERATION. Don't you set your aspects
[19:15] or your anticipations or your ambitions
[19:18] way down low.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; You were called for a higher calling
[19:23] than that.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; And and I'll say that I was just
[19:26] listening to hearing him and brother
[19:28] Bam, it really struck my heart the way
[19:30] he says this. He said, "Listen, what's
[19:32] the matter today is we adopted a
[19:35] different tutor for the church." He
[19:37] said, "Than what God gave us."
[19:39] &gt;&gt; He looked out the best tutor he could
[19:41] find. And his tutor wasn't a bishop or
[19:44] some pope, but it was the Holy Spirit
[19:46] that was given as a tutor to the church
[19:48] to raise it. And you're aware of that.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; And he said the Holy Spirit is to raise
[19:53] the church and to nurture it in honor
[19:57] and respect of the father and of his
[19:59] word. Now the the the the Holy Spirit is
[20:03] nurturing the church to honor his word.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Do do you see that? There's there's
[20:09] something that makes a person honor. If
[20:11] you have to make somebody do the word,
[20:14] then they they need something in them
[20:17] that makes them honor the word.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? That's something just
[20:21] from your heart. It's a willingly it's a
[20:24] willing I remember how brother man
[20:26] prayed it. He said, "Father, give me a
[20:27] will to do thy will."
[20:29] Amen. You You need a will to do the will
[20:31] of God. See, and and then brother Bam
[20:33] says it. See, he said, "But but you see
[20:36] what a son of God has got now, but we've
[20:38] adopted men with theology and some of
[20:41] their man-made creeds, and you see where
[20:43] it's got us to." Now, he's talking to
[20:45] the Pentecostal world, and he's telling
[20:47] them, "Look, look, you've adopted
[20:49] bishops, and you've adopted theology,
[20:51] and you've let other men tell you, amen,
[20:54] what the church ought to be like and how
[20:56] it ought to be." He said, "But see God
[20:58] sent the Holy Ghost."
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Now, now, Brother Brandon was showing
[21:02] them that the true sign of the Holy
[21:05] Ghost. Now, that's why there was such a
[21:07] big argument over whether tongues was
[21:09] the evidence or the word was the
[21:11] evidence. See, because brother Bannon
[21:13] was trying to show them if you truly
[21:16] have the Holy Ghost. The only real
[21:17] evidence of that is that you would
[21:20] receive the message of your age. So you
[21:23] would HAVE AN OPEN HEART FOR THAT
[21:25] MESSAGE to come because we found out the
[21:27] message wasn't William Brandom. It
[21:29] wasn't just the seven church age
[21:31] messenger but rather it was the coming
[21:34] of the Messiah. The anointed word was
[21:37] coming to the church and we were going
[21:39] to OPEN UP OUR HEARTS JUST LIKE IN
[21:41] HEAVEN when Jesus headed into the gates
[21:43] and he said lift up oh you gates of
[21:45] everlasting life and let the king of
[21:47] glory come in. They shouted back and
[21:49] said who is the king of glory? And he
[21:51] said he's the one mighty in the battle.
[21:54] AMEN. YOU YOU SEE AND AND THAT SPIRIT
[21:56] HAVE OF God has come into the church
[21:58] today as the great Messiah. AND YOU CAN
[22:01] HEAR THE VOICE. BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE
[22:03] DOOR NOW. LIFT UP, OH YE GATES of
[22:06] everlasting life. Let the Messiah come
[22:09] into that heart in rulership.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; See, in every area of life. Now, now you
[22:16] you say, "Preacher, uh, what are you
[22:17] really getting now?" I want you to see
[22:19] that it matters what your ambition is of
[22:22] what you're going to settle for.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Now, if it's just your ambition to be a
[22:27] member of a church, then you're going to
[22:28] settle pretty much for any kind of
[22:30] preaching.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; If you if you just want to be a general
[22:33] church or just a normal church or just a
[22:36] carnal church, and I say normal church
[22:37] because brother Bam said that's the
[22:38] foolish virgin, right? He said they're
[22:40] just a normal church. He said one
[22:41] without the oil.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; But you see, it's a carnal it's a carnal
[22:46] church. And if that's the ambition, then
[22:48] there won't be there won't be any altar
[22:50] calls.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; There won't be no dying out. You won't
[22:53] have no prayer. You you won't have any
[22:56] any times of repentance and it'll all
[22:58] just be cushy and sugary sermons and
[23:01] kind of like throwing leaves on a fire.
[23:03] It'll be a it'll be a flame, but the
[23:05] fire won't last the night.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Amen. It's according what
[23:09] you want. You just want to hoodoo and
[23:11] have a big time and and and leave the
[23:13] same as you came. Now, if that's the
[23:15] case, it really doesn't matter what kind
[23:18] of sermon or what kind of teaching or
[23:20] what kind of word you sit under. But if
[23:23] your ambition is to be a true son,
[23:26] &gt;&gt; if your ambition is to be that bride of
[23:28] Christ, THEN GOD SENT a message to take
[23:31] you to that place.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; THEN PEOPLE ASKED ME, "BROTHER M, WHY
[23:35] ARE YOU SO set on on just uh preaching
[23:38] things brother Brandham said and and
[23:40] bringing the quotes and and settling the
[23:42] church by those things? WHY ARE YOU so
[23:44] set on those things? Because I know that
[23:46] if it's our goal to be the bride,
[23:48] there's only one ministry going to put
[23:50] the bride in her place. There isn't
[23:53] another ministry that's going to be able
[23:55] to lead this bride into the mind of God.
[23:58] Cuz that's where your bride in his mind
[24:02] &gt;&gt; and it'll take the mind of God. Now,
[24:04] Brother Bam says, "See, there's rules of
[24:06] life." And and he said, "If you cheat in
[24:08] the rules of life, you get
[24:09] disqualified."
[24:11] &gt;&gt; And he speaks of natural life. He says,
[24:13] "See, you you can get he he takes I
[24:16] think a beautiful thing is he takes a
[24:18] how that Hitler won victories and
[24:21] Napoleon won victories." He said, "But
[24:23] those victories were short-lived."
[24:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because they didn't follow the
[24:27] rules to get the victories they had."
[24:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And life is the same way."
[24:33] &gt;&gt; See, if you're taking a shortcut to your
[24:35] victory,
[24:37] &gt;&gt; then a victory won't last you. That's
[24:40] why that you you you can't JUST YOU YOU
[24:42] CAN'T just let it all go over the top
[24:44] all the time. See, we can teach over
[24:47] every issue and every problem until we
[24:50] can maintain a certain level. But if
[24:52] we're going to get higher, we've got to
[24:54] reach down in that heart and deal with
[24:56] an individual situations of our lives
[24:59] because we want victory to last more
[25:01] than the service. We want it to last
[25:03] more than me. What What if the church
[25:05] was dispersed tomorrow? We'd like to see
[25:08] a victory in you today that would last
[25:10] you until you stepped in the portals of
[25:12] glory. IF YOU COULD NEVER STEP foot in
[25:14] another church, I pray to God there's
[25:16] something in you that'll put you in
[25:18] glory. Because I'll be honest, I love to
[25:21] see the pews full, but that is not the
[25:23] ambition of Wayne Lawson. We My ambition
[25:25] is not to fill up this church. My
[25:27] ambition is to fill up heaven. I want to
[25:30] see people in heaven. Amen. I think of
[25:33] brother Brandham when he said he said
[25:35] I'd rather not have any children at all.
[25:37] It's a bunch of illegitimate children.
[25:39] People that can't take the word or that
[25:41] can't take the things of God. I pray GOD
[25:44] GIVE US THE HEART TO PREACH TRUTH TO THE
[25:47] PLACE THAT it is liberating. NOT NOT
[25:49] JUST STIFLING, NOT NOT A BONDAGE, BUT A
[25:52] TRUTH that is liberating that that'll
[25:54] give you grace and give you strength
[25:56] over the situations of your life. if you
[25:58] got to play it according to the word of
[26:00] God if you're going to keep a victory.
[26:02] There's so many people that doesn't seem
[26:04] to even have any kind of purpose in
[26:06] life. Now, I'm going to follow just a
[26:08] channel brother Brandon makes here. If
[26:10] you you see I it matters what you're
[26:12] doing to the rules you're going to play
[26:14] by.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and here brother Brandham
[26:17] is saying, "But it seems like somebody
[26:19] so many people don't have purpose." Now,
[26:21] we're seeing that in the age we're
[26:23] living in since uh 2020. They called it
[26:25] the great resignation.
[26:27] Uh, United States of America resigned.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Hundreds of thousands of workers never
[26:33] went back to work.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; They resigned. They lost purpose.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; They lost hopes.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's called the great resignation.
[26:41] That's the millennial age that we're
[26:42] living in. Uh people are not uh pressing
[26:45] forward for higher life. They're not
[26:48] looking for it. You know, you got young
[26:49] people don't don't even know what they
[26:51] want to do with their life yet.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; There's no there's no ambition. So So
[26:54] there's no way to start preparatory.
[26:56] There's no way to prepare yourself
[26:59] because you you you can't come to a
[27:01] decision. A lot of times you you can
[27:03] find scriptural truths. A doubleminded
[27:05] man is unstable in his ways.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; You you you can't serve God and mammon
[27:11] at the same time. You have to make up
[27:13] your mind what you want to do and then
[27:16] follow the path that gets you there. If
[27:18] you want to be a medical doctor, amen,
[27:20] there's certain there's a certain path
[27:21] to take and you can start that path
[27:23] early. If you want to be an engineer,
[27:25] you better be heavy in math. If you, you
[27:27] know, if you want to be in biology, you
[27:28] better take the sciences. You You see,
[27:30] in natural life, there is things that
[27:33] prepare you for the future.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we recognize this and I I'll
[27:38] say this and and and coming back because
[27:39] our ambitions naturally probably are a
[27:42] little different than the rest of the
[27:43] world naturally because we have and I
[27:44] don't I don't want to put one of our
[27:46] young ladies under conviction because
[27:48] some of our young ladies their great
[27:49] ambition in life is to be a wife and
[27:51] mother which I certainly believe is the
[27:53] highest calling there is to a to a life
[27:57] according to brother Brandham. Amen. Do
[27:58] you see then the the ambition? Amen. See
[28:02] and then you say you get in school.
[28:04] Let's just talk to the young people just
[28:05] a moment. You get in school and then you
[28:07] you get around people that have and
[28:09] maybe they don't have any spiritual
[28:11] ambition and they they watch television
[28:13] and and they got all kinds of characters
[28:15] and it's it's they do all kinds of
[28:17] things. Even as young girls, they start
[28:19] acting certain ways, doing certain ways
[28:21] and then our young girls are around them
[28:23] and and our boys are around them. Then
[28:25] they start trying to drift toward
[28:28] whatever that influence is in that
[28:30] school. And you watch it in work. You
[28:33] watch maybe an influential person in in
[28:35] the work and someone not real committed
[28:37] to the Lord and they be at work and next
[28:39] thing you know they're taking on
[28:40] characters or habits and and they're
[28:42] starting to follow along that line. And
[28:44] brother says, "See, but there it is." He
[28:47] says, "Now, we got to have an ambition
[28:49] higher than just uh uh maybe a raise in
[28:52] our salary or our new job." See, you
[28:54] need you need ambitions. Amen. I I'm
[28:56] going to say this very openly. Young
[28:58] men, you need a job.
[29:01] [Applause]
[29:02] My Bible says that if a man won't
[29:04] provide for his family, he's worse than
[29:07] an infidel.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Now, don't come to me being lazy and
[29:12] then think that we're going to pet that
[29:14] devil. It is a devil. And it's easy to
[29:17] be lazy and find an excuse not to work.
[29:20] But if you want to work, Amen. There is
[29:22] jobs and there's ways to work. AMEN.
[29:24] THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO do
[29:26] somewhere. Amen. But you see, well, if
[29:28] if you want to be a little lazy, you can
[29:30] find a way to be lazy. I I hate a lazy
[29:33] spirit.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what's wrong with
[29:39] you?" I tell you what's wrong with you.
[29:40] We're living in Leodysa, and Leosa is
[29:43] teaching our young men not to raise up
[29:46] and be men.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; I found I found out something yesterday.
[29:50] I thought, man, I need to preach a whole
[29:52] sermon on it. I heard my wife talking to
[29:54] her mom on the phone. They talking about
[29:56] she got a bunch of new chickens and they
[29:58] trying to wait to develop see see if
[29:59] they got a rooster among them because a
[30:01] bunch of little chicks you know and and
[30:02] and I heard them talking and Chris said
[30:04] well the rooster ought to be developing
[30:06] by now but but if he ain't said one of
[30:08] those one of those hens will start
[30:10] acting like a rooster. I said no way. I
[30:14] mean I I'm easedropping. No way.
[30:18] SHE SAID YEAH. SHE SAID YEAH COURTNEY
[30:20] HAD ONE. And I said really? She said
[30:23] yeah. Is that TRUE COURTNEY? AMEN. SHE
[30:25] had a they they had a a group of
[30:27] chickens and there was no rooster and
[30:29] one of the hens started getting a bigger
[30:31] comb, started scratching, growing bigger
[30:33] spears, trying I mean literally started
[30:35] to transition into a leadership role in
[30:39] because there was no MALE THERE. AND
[30:41] SOME OF THESE men wonder WHY THEIR WIVES
[30:44] ARE SO AGGRESSIVE and dominant in their
[30:46] homes. IT'S BECAUSE YOU NEVER STOOD UP
[30:47] AND BEEN A MAN YET.
[30:51] YOU WANT A YOU WANT a You want a YOU
[30:52] WANT A GOOD, SOLID, SUBTLE WIFE, BE A
[30:56] MAN.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; You can't set up all night and play
[30:59] video games and and her respect you.
[31:02] Come on. She married a man, not some
[31:04] little boy.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm too tired to go to work. Well,
[31:09] put your phone down, turn the internet
[31:12] off, AND BE A MAN AND RAISE YOUR
[31:14] CHILDREN.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; WELL, I've got to watch Fox News, YOU
[31:18] KNOW.
[31:19] WE MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND DO IT,
[31:21] HAVEN'T WE? THAT'S A CURSE out of hell.
[31:24] It ain't nothing but 24 hours of
[31:26] negative and bad news and and people get
[31:28] so ANXIOUS AND SO FEARFUL AND HALF THE
[31:31] TIME WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ON THERE SO
[31:33] POLITICAL IT'S SUCH a lie. And instead
[31:35] of listening to the word of God instead
[31:37] of prayer, INSTEAD OF THE BIBLE, YOU
[31:39] FILLED YOUR LIFE WITH FOX NEWS AND CNN
[31:42] NEWS AND TNT AND ENTERTAINMENTS. AMEN.
[31:45] YOU CANNOT KEEP A VICTORY WITH THOSE
[31:47] RULES.
[31:48] YOU SAY, "WELL, PREACHER, YOU'RE JUST
[31:50] BEING A LEGALIST." I'M NOT BEING a
[31:51] legalist. Amen. It ain't got nothing to
[31:54] do with legalism. IT'S IT'S YOUR
[31:56] AMBITION. WHAT IS YOUR AMBITION?
[32:00] [Music]
[32:01] &gt;&gt; What's your ambition in this life? I
[32:03] TELL YOU MY AMBITION. I DID NOT MOVE TO
[32:06] OHIO. AMEN. TO PLAY CHURCH. AMEN. I CAME
[32:10] HERE UNDER THE WILL OF GOD. AMEN. AND I
[32:12] BELIEVE THERE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF
[32:14] GOD IN THIS PLACE. AND PEOPLE ARE
[32:16] LOOKING FOR THE HOLY GHOST TO LEAD them
[32:18] into this generation. I'm I'm not just
[32:21] fussing. I I've been listening to a
[32:23] prophet. And he said it real clear. He
[32:25] said, "You women," he said,
[32:28] "I could have played you the tape." He
[32:31] said, "You're listening to another
[32:32] voice. That's why you're cutting your
[32:33] hair."
[32:36] &gt;&gt; I can read 1 Corinthians 11 and the
[32:38] Bible said a woman don't even have a
[32:39] right to pray when she cuts her hair.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; One prayer is the prayer of repentance.
[32:44] That's all she's got.
[32:46] Brother Brandon said, "When you wear
[32:47] them skin tight clothes,
[32:49] &gt;&gt; even if it is a dress,
[32:51] &gt;&gt; and you get all sensual and you're
[32:53] putting yourself out in front of men
[32:55] like that." Now, Brother Brandon said,
[32:56] "You're committing adultery with every
[32:58] sinner that looks at you
[32:59] &gt;&gt; and you say, "I ain't touched the man."
[33:01] Brother Bam said, "But on the day of
[33:03] judgment, when God judges that sinner
[33:05] for looking at you like that, you'll
[33:07] stand right there with him as an
[33:08] adulteress."
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Man, that's tough preaching, ain't it?
[33:14] It's according what your ambition is.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; If your ambition is to be a leodyian sex
[33:19] queen, oh, you hate me right now for
[33:21] that. But if you're looking to be a
[33:22] daughter of God and to come into the
[33:25] presence of God, you love me for
[33:27] preaching like that.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT WE NEED IS THE POWER OF THE
[33:30] HOLY GHOST TO CUT THE BONDAGE OFF AND TO
[33:34] TAKE THE PRESSURE AWAY THAT CHILDREN CAN
[33:37] LIVE FREE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. GOD
[33:39] NEVER CALLED YOU to be a makeup artist
[33:42] for some Maybelline.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Brown say one time,
[33:46] "Beauty was a curse." And I didn't know
[33:48] what he meant until later I realized
[33:49] some girls are too pretty just to be
[33:51] common.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; They just cannot humble themselves to
[33:56] just be common. They got to put that
[33:58] stuff on them.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; They got to juice that up. Let me tell
[34:01] you something. Amen. I heard the prophet
[34:03] say this very clearly. Man, it's so
[34:05] strong. He said, "Lady, if you're
[34:07] wearing makeup, there ain't but one
[34:09] woman in the Bible that wore makeup,
[34:12] &gt;&gt; and her was Jezebel, and God called her
[34:15] dog meat."
[34:20] &gt;&gt; That's a That's a That's a prophet.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; A prophet of God. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?
[34:24] HE SAID, "YOU never put that on to meet
[34:26] God. You put it on to meet a man."
[34:28] And he said, "If you if you believe me
[34:30] to be a prophet," he said, "Before you
[34:33] go in the presence of God, you better
[34:34] wash that off of your face."
[34:37] &gt;&gt; That's rough, ain't it?
[34:39] &gt;&gt; And you know what? He fog was behind
[34:41] that. And way he says it, it just struck
[34:43] me so strong. He said, "And you men
[34:46] &gt;&gt; that would let her do it."
[34:48] &gt;&gt; And I thought, there it is. Really?
[34:51] &gt;&gt; There it is. There's something in that
[34:52] man that wants his wife to look that way
[34:54] or she wouldn't do that. There's
[34:57] something in that man that wants her a
[34:59] little toward the world because he's
[35:01] just a little ashamed of that gospel
[35:03] look. LET ME TELL YOU, I'M NOT ASHAMED
[35:06] of the gospel look. Amen. I MARRIED A
[35:08] CHRISTIAN. I WANT A CHRISTIAN. I DESIRED
[35:10] A CHRISTIAN. AND PRAISE GOD THAT THERE'S
[35:13] SOME CHRISTIAN WOMEN that have kept
[35:15] their morals in this generation.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking to pet Amen. I know how
[35:21] it is. LET'S PET THE CAT. WELL, LET'S
[35:24] PET IT THE OTHER WAY AND SEE WHICH IS
[35:25] NATURE IS ON SOMEBODY. IT'S ALL ONE WAY,
[35:28] BUT AMEN. PET IT THE OTHER WAY AND FIND
[35:30] OUT. AMEN. CAN IT TAKE THE WORD OF GOD?
[35:33] Is it really the Holy Ghost?
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Higher ambitions.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see what it is? Amen. You
[35:41] got to set your affection on a higher
[35:43] ambition. Amen. Brother man says it very
[35:45] clearly. He would have a purpose of us
[35:47] coming here. What? The God that sent you
[35:50] here has a purpose for you being here.
[35:52] You didn't just come to this earth to be
[35:54] here. God put you here.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD PUT YOU HERE, THERE'S A
[35:59] PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; He had a purpose for the tree. Had a
[36:03] purpose for the animals. He had A
[36:04] PURPOSE FOR EVERYTHING. HOW MUCH greater
[36:07] for his sons and daughters of God.
[36:09] SOMEBODY SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, I DON'T
[36:10] KNOW WHAT MY PURPOSE IS." WELL, let me
[36:12] hit it one more time. Get off of your
[36:14] television.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Get off of your YouTube.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Get off of the internet. Get in prayer.
[36:20] AND ASK THE GOD THAT sent you here what
[36:22] it is he sent you here for.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Why do y'all think the devil's so busy
[36:28] on that, guys? He's wanting to cut your
[36:30] communication with the Lord so you'll
[36:31] live you'll live in a way that you're no
[36:34] challenge to the enemy. Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Satan is begging you, begging you to
[36:39] stay your mind engrossed into the issues
[36:42] and the modern problems because he DON'T
[36:44] WANT YOU TO he don't want YOU TO SEE
[36:47] &gt;&gt; THE CAPABILITIES AND AND THE CHALLENGE.
[36:50] I KNOW YOU'RE USED TO being informed.
[36:51] Well, the Holy Spirit spoke to me and
[36:53] said, "Don't inform them. Confront them.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Don't inform me this morning. Confront
[36:58] me. That's what I want." This is a house
[37:00] of judgment.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; JUDGMENT BEGINS AT THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[37:04] THAT'S the word of God. I you know I'm
[37:06] preaching
[37:08] &gt;&gt; and you you see what it is. How how do
[37:10] we we we'll never we'll never keep
[37:12] victory by keeping fashions of the
[37:14] world.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; And sometimes people losing victory.
[37:18] It's almost like they want to blame the
[37:20] church.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody having a ton of marriage
[37:23] trouble and they trying to find a way to
[37:25] fix it and you can't even get them to
[37:26] come church on a midweek.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; You you you can't get them to sit down
[37:30] and read the Bible or pray.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[37:33] And you wonder why there's so much
[37:35] trouble.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing wrong with the Lord.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing wrong with the message.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see,
[37:44] &gt;&gt; you you see, you're keeping up with the
[37:46] fashions of the world. Now, watch
[37:47] Brother Brandham say it. You You'll
[37:49] never keep victory that way.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; But faith is a victory that overcomes
[37:54] the world. You see now now where this
[37:57] really gathers up is where brother Bam
[37:59] says that he said he had a traveler come
[38:00] to his house and he said a young man
[38:03] come and he was up in the age and he
[38:04] come knocked on the door and he comes in
[38:06] he says he brother Bram said I'm going
[38:07] to give him a sandwich he said I got to
[38:09] talk to him I said young man he said
[38:12] where you from he said oh nowhere
[38:14] &gt;&gt; he said where you going he said nowhere
[38:18] &gt;&gt; man said what what do you mean he said
[38:21] well just wherever I hang my hat that's
[38:23] where it's that
[38:25] &gt;&gt; he said, "How long you been doing this?"
[38:28] He said, "20 years."
[38:31] &gt;&gt; 20 years floating.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; 20 years in the same floating situation,
[38:39] &gt;&gt; no home,
[38:40] &gt;&gt; no life, no stability. 20 years.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Do you see brother Ramis trying to tell
[38:47] the church something?
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Pentecost, you were born 40 years ago.
[38:52] How old are you? And how long will you
[38:55] just float?
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Do you see? He's talking to the
[38:58] Pentecostal world. The spirit's moving
[39:00] among them, but he keeps telling them,
[39:03] you got to get grounded on the solid
[39:05] rock
[39:06] &gt;&gt; of the word of God because we're
[39:08] building. We're building something. And
[39:10] brother Bam says, see, that's the
[39:12] attitude of the people. He said, like a
[39:14] floating driftwood. Amen. Now, I I just
[39:16] want to take a moment and go back to my
[39:18] roots back to Black Rock and Black River
[39:21] uh back in uh Arkansas, I I grew up on a
[39:24] river, and one thing that you see is
[39:26] during floods and things like that, you
[39:28] know, but then when the river settles
[39:29] down that a river has a bunch of bins in
[39:31] it, you know, and and and we like to
[39:34] catfish a lot. Well, a lot of times if
[39:36] you find where them where them log jams
[39:38] are, that's where them they'll dig a big
[39:40] big hole at one end of the other. And a
[39:41] lot of times that's where you find your
[39:43] your good catfishing and stuff. It's
[39:44] right in behind in big log jams. But you
[39:47] know what causes those log jams is? It's
[39:49] drifting wood.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; And what it is, as long as the river's
[39:53] straight, a big old tree can fall. As
[39:54] long as the river's straight, it it'll
[39:56] just drift right along in the river. But
[39:58] when a turn comes,
[40:00] &gt;&gt; it'll hang up in that turn
[40:02] &gt;&gt; because there see there's other trash
[40:04] there in the corners. And what it does
[40:06] is it hangs up in the trash piles on the
[40:09] corners. Now, if you're just drifting
[40:11] along in life's journey, see, there's a
[40:14] play. You're going to get hung up.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; You're just going to get hung somewhere.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to get hung up.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to you're going to
[40:24] hit one of those bins and something's
[40:26] going to be You just can't overcome
[40:28] that.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; It's just going to be too much.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; You're going to have a a falling out
[40:32] with a church or you're going to have a
[40:34] falling out in the home or something's
[40:36] going to happen. going to be a blow up
[40:37] and then you're going to get hung up
[40:39] right there. Now, I wished it wasn't
[40:40] true, but I have seen many I have seen
[40:43] many people that never got past certain
[40:46] points of their life.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; But, Brother Bam says, "But if you'll
[40:49] notice this," he'll say, "You you you
[40:52] you people that run these rivers, and
[40:54] I've did it a lot, and and he says, "You
[40:56] do it in a boat." Now, he he was talking
[40:57] about a wood boat. He said, "But a wood
[40:59] boat could be made out of the same
[41:00] material that that floating log's made
[41:03] out of." He said, 'But the difference
[41:05] between the two is the log has been in
[41:07] the hand of the master. And he said that
[41:10] log was shaped, he said, to be able to
[41:13] cut the current and then the master will
[41:15] put a power motor on the back of it. And
[41:17] then when it comes up to them points,
[41:19] there's some power to push them out of
[41:21] it.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; See, if you if you don't have something
[41:24] to push you along, then you get caught
[41:27] up in those places along life's journey.
[41:29] You you all been there. you know, we
[41:31] could just start on this side of the
[41:33] room and just move across and there's
[41:34] been a log jam that tried to hang you.
[41:37] You know, every every person sitting
[41:39] here there you you've hit the log jam,
[41:41] but there was something that guided you
[41:43] out of it and and moved you on a life
[41:46] life's journey. And and brother Bam
[41:48] says, "See what it is." He says, "You'll
[41:50] either meet God as a masterpiece that
[41:52] he's worked on or a floating driftwood."
[41:55] See, but if you purpose something in
[41:57] your heart, God will bring a reality to
[42:00] that purpose. I purpose to be a son of
[42:02] God. I purpose in my heart to do the
[42:05] things of God. Now, amen. I believe that
[42:07] you can get victory over everything that
[42:10] it's according to the very inspiration
[42:13] or the ambition of your life. I believe
[42:16] there's ambition. Now, ambition is a
[42:19] strong desire to achieve something.
[42:21] Typically, it'll require determination
[42:24] and hard work. Let me give you a few
[42:26] words. Aspiration, intention, goal, aim,
[42:29] objective, object, purpose, intent,
[42:31] plan, scheme, mission, calling,
[42:34] vocation, desire, wish, design, target,
[42:36] end, dream, hope. In other words,
[42:38] something out in front of you.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and if you notice in John
[42:43] chapter 1 and verse 12, it said here,
[42:46] "But as many as received him, to them he
[42:49] gave power
[42:50] to become sons."
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Now watch this power to become. It
[42:55] actually means in the Greek it means to
[42:57] emerge or transition from one point to
[43:00] another. Fundamentally become. So it's
[43:03] not an exact equivalent to the verb to
[43:05] be, but it but it actually means to
[43:07] become to to change a condition, a
[43:10] state, or a place. It means to come into
[43:12] manifestation, movement, or motion,
[43:15] emerging in growth.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW WATCH, BROTHER says it in
[43:20] Galatians 4. He said, "Look, you're an
[43:22] heir, but as long as you're a child, you
[43:25] differ nothing from a servant, though he
[43:28] be lord of all, but he's under tutors
[43:30] and governs until a time appointed. So
[43:32] you can be a Holy Ghost-filled
[43:33] Christian, but until you start growth,
[43:36] you differ nothing from a servant
[43:38] because YOU'RE NOT FINDING YOUR
[43:40] AUTHORITY or your ambition, amen, to
[43:43] learn the things that God has designed
[43:45] for this age. I believe THE BIBLE SAID
[43:47] THAT we've been predestinated unto
[43:49] adoption. I am not reaching for
[43:52] something that don't belong to me.
[43:54] You see, my expectation and ambition
[43:57] happens to be a promise that God made to
[43:59] the church THAT WE COULD POSSESS A
[44:02] DIVINE NATURE. AMEN. IT'S THE PROMISE OF
[44:04] GOD, a divine nature, an adoption of
[44:07] sons, that we could have this. Now, what
[44:09] does ambition mean? It's a quality or a
[44:12] motive of an individual that drives
[44:14] actions towards a particular goal. if it
[44:17] can help a person push themselves to
[44:19] engage in hard work to tasks that reap
[44:21] specific rewards. A driving ambition can
[44:24] be a powerful motivator for achieving
[44:27] success. Amen. We we can characterize
[44:30] ambition. It's the difference between
[44:32] healthy and potentially unhealthy levels
[44:34] of trait strategies and balancing in
[44:36] your life. So without ambition in your
[44:39] life, you're going to be an unbalanced
[44:41] person. Ambition is something that it's
[44:44] Latin and it actually means a strong
[44:46] desire to achieve a perfect end or a
[44:49] particular end. It also refers to an
[44:53] adherent desire. Amen. It means that
[44:56] there is a ambition is what helps you
[44:58] prioritize your actions.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; It's what helps you make a decision. Do
[45:03] I do this or I don't do this?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; You're sitting in front of that big
[45:06] piece of cake and you want to lose 10.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Do I do it? Do I don't do I do it? Don't
[45:12] I?
[45:13] &gt;&gt; It's not law. You can eat it if you want
[45:15] it,
[45:16] &gt;&gt; but if it's your ambition to lose 10,
[45:18] don't eat it.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; But if you do eat it, don't give up on
[45:23] your goal.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[45:28] &gt;&gt; If it's your ambition to be a son and
[45:30] you going and EAT THE CAKE, DON'T GIVE
[45:32] UP ON your goal.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; SET YOUR HIGH SET YOUR CALLING HIGHER
[45:37] than one meal.
[45:39] SUCH A HIGHER CALLING THAN ONE SIN OR
[45:42] ONE MISTAKE OR ONE BAD DAY OR ONE BAD
[45:44] FIGHT. OUR CALLING IS HIGHER THAN THAT.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING FURTHER THAN ONE MEAL,
[45:50] CHURCH.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a sense of purpose, a
[45:55] resilience. Ambition can strengthen your
[45:58] beliefs and give you energy to persist
[46:00] to persist through obstacles when you
[46:03] challenge yourself and push past your
[46:05] comfort zones. Now, there's two
[46:07] different kinds of churches, and you got
[46:08] to be careful to not drift with the
[46:10] carnal because the carnal church, it
[46:12] seems, it seems spiritual, but it's a
[46:14] carnal church. And brother Bram says
[46:16] they're drifting back to mama church.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; See, there's there drifting. So, don't
[46:22] drift with them. Just cuz somebody goes
[46:23] a certain way, that don't mean we go
[46:25] that way.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing what I'm saying? Don't
[46:30] get online and watch another church and
[46:33] then want this church to drift toward
[46:35] that church.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; You see, our calling is higher than
[46:39] being like another church.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; WE WE HAVE SET OUR CALLING ON being like
[46:45] Jesus Christ.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be something if you go over
[46:51] and have supper with a family and you
[46:53] get back home, you tell Cheyenne, "I
[46:55] want you to be like that woman.
[46:59] [Music]
[47:01] I'm available for counsel if you need
[47:03] me.
[47:07] That wouldn't be no different than me
[47:09] going visiting some church and coming
[47:10] back here and want this church like that
[47:12] church.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I I think that's a very
[47:17] carnal way to view things.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; We are a very unique church,
[47:23] &gt;&gt; but it's a Holy Ghostled church.
[47:26] and leave us alone in our oddness. WE
[47:29] ACTUALLY ENJOY IT.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; WE ACTUALLY ENJOY JUST BEING ABLE TO
[47:33] STAND UP AND holler amen. AND IT'S NOT
[47:36] SO formal that that that YOU KNOW THAT
[47:38] SOMEBODY CAN WEAR BLUE JEANS. IT'S ALL
[47:40] RIGHT WITH US. If you want to wear blue
[47:41] jeans, just just keep it keep it modest.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Men,
[47:53] &gt;&gt; they're starting to act like
[47:54] organizations.
[47:57] We are not an organization
[48:00] &gt;&gt; and we're not drifting towards
[48:02] organization.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; So if you see a resistance from your
[48:06] pastor against organization, it's we are
[48:09] not drifting that way because it's a
[48:11] very short victory.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; You can have good services for a short
[48:17] time.
[48:19] You can enjoy great fellowship for a
[48:22] short time, but if you don't stay on the
[48:24] word,
[48:26] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; You see, they begin drifting. NOW,
[48:29] BROTHER BADAM TALKS ABOUT A soul that's
[48:32] unsaved. And he says they're drifting on
[48:34] life. And he says they're drifting
[48:36] towards, he said, without a pilot to
[48:39] guide them.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; It almost breaks my heart to hear him
[48:41] say it.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; If you ever heard the tape, he said
[48:44] floating him with the tides to hear the
[48:46] roar of them great cataracts. those
[48:48] falls. What a horrible thing it would be
[48:50] to a soul drifting,
[48:53] &gt;&gt; coming up to the end of your life and
[48:55] you've been drifting without any
[48:57] guidance. Amen. Away from the falls.
[48:59] Amen. You got to come to an end. If
[49:02] you're here this morning and you don't
[49:03] know Jesus Christ, let me address you
[49:05] just a moment. You're drifting in your
[49:07] life and and you think a job is your
[49:10] achievement or a family is your
[49:11] achievement. But if you don't know Jesus
[49:13] Christ, you ain't achieved anything
[49:15] because this life is very short and all
[49:17] flesh is grass and your breath is just
[49:20] spit for a moment. You only hold the
[49:23] breath. You only are promised the breath
[49:25] you're holding in your mouth right now.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother, I don't know if
[49:29] I'm ready to follow the Lord Jesus."
[49:31] Well, let me say this. An indecision is
[49:33] a decision. A DECISION TO NOT follow
[49:36] Jesus. Amen. I won't make a commitment.
[49:39] Is the same as saying, "I won't follow
[49:41] you, Lord."
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Drifting and you're going to come to an
[49:45] end and you're going to go TO A DEVIL'S
[49:47] HELL and a sinner's grave. AND IT'S THE
[49:49] SADDEST STORY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GO
[49:52] through every roadblock. You're going to
[49:54] go through the cross of Calvary, THROUGH
[49:56] THE BLOOD OF CHRIST, through the
[49:58] prophets, THROUGH THE AGONY OF THE
[50:00] CHURCH, FROM THE SWEATING OF THE
[50:01] MINISTRIES, from the lives that were
[50:03] given to prevent YOU FROM GOING THAT
[50:05] WAY. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT
[50:07] YOUR WAY TO HELL.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; And it's a sad day when men end up in
[50:13] hell when they don't have to.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; God is not willing that any man would
[50:17] perish, but that every man would come
[50:19] unto everlasting life. THERE IS A GOD
[50:21] HERE THIS MORNING. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TURN
[50:23] YOUR LIFE TO HIM, HE CAN SAVE YOU. AND
[50:26] WHILE I'M PREACHING, HE CAN SAVE YOU
[50:28] RIGHT NOW. ALL YOU GOT TO SAY IS, "LORD,
[50:31] I NEED A SAVIOR."
[50:35] You said, "Brother Wayne, that ain't
[50:36] very encouraging." Well, let me just say
[50:38] I I I I heard a story one time about a
[50:40] about a guy that was out in a boat in
[50:41] the middle of the ocean and he had a
[50:43] boat wreck and hit his head and broke
[50:44] his arm and it flipped him out in the
[50:46] middle OF THE OCEAN, PACIFIC OCEAN, and
[50:48] the sharks was swimming and he was
[50:50] bleeding and Coast Guard seen the the
[50:52] the distress calls and they come flying
[50:54] OVER WITH A HELICOPTER AND THEY'RE
[50:56] HOVERING over the guy. Well, let me ask
[50:57] you, DOES THE GUY NEED ENCOURAGING OR
[50:59] does he need saving?
[51:02] &gt;&gt; And sometimes people don't need
[51:04] encourage that. What they really need is
[51:06] an experience with God. THEY NEED TO GET
[51:09] THEIR SOUL RIGHT WITH GOD. THEY DON'T
[51:11] NEED TO BE TOLD THEY'RE SAVED when
[51:13] they're not saved. THEY NEED TO GET AN
[51:15] OLDFASHIONED EXPERIENCE THAT'LL MAKE
[51:17] THEM FALL IN LOVE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD.
[51:20] LISTEN, YOU CAN'T PET THAT DEVIL. IT'LL
[51:22] TAKE THE SOUL TO HELL.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; It's not legalism, folks. It's only the
[51:28] acceptance of faith by the BLOOD OF
[51:31] JESUS CHRIST that can save a man. You
[51:33] can't offer God good works
[51:37] &gt;&gt; drifting over that cataract yonder.
[51:40] Wouldn't it be a sad thing for a man to
[51:42] drift out of this life into the
[51:44] cataracts of hell when he was offered a
[51:47] way out?
[51:49] &gt;&gt; But you know, in reading that, I got to
[51:51] thinking about drifting.
[51:53] Now, there's two ways to drift. There's
[51:55] there's this man I'm talking about that
[51:57] don't know the Lord. Yeah.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; But then let's talk about brother
[52:00] Brandham in the middle of the floods
[52:01] back in 33.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; He was drifting with a motor.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; But he was drifting that he he had
[52:09] disobeyed the Lord.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Remember that?
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And he was he had a motor ON THAT BOAT.
[52:15] HE WASN'T HE wasn't lost,
[52:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:17] &gt;&gt; There was a MOTOR RIGHT THERE. HE WAS IN
[52:19] A WELLCRAFTED UH FINE THING. He wasn't
[52:22] just floating on a log.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS EVEN A MASTER BOATER. HE HE
[52:26] HE RUN A BOAT from a KID UP, BUT HIS
[52:29] motor wasn't working. See, he was
[52:30] drifting a different way. And and and
[52:33] watch this, HOW HOW THAT THINGS come up
[52:34] in life as Christians, AS CHRISTIANS
[52:37] THAT SOMETIMES WE DISOBEY the Lord. WE
[52:39] GET OURSELVES IN WRONG SITUATIONS or
[52:41] troubles or even if it's not
[52:43] disobedience, sometimes it's great
[52:45] disappointments.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm preaching to you.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes things don't work out like you
[52:52] wanted them to. ALL RIGHT.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU FIGHT REAL hard for a
[52:57] certain direction and then all of a
[52:58] sudden everything you were fighting for
[53:00] was took away from you and it goes
[53:02] another direction.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; See, and what happens is if you're not
[53:08] careful, you'll resign.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; You'll pull back in your spirit and
[53:13] you'll hide
[53:15] &gt;&gt; and you'll just start drifting along.
[53:17] Yeah, that's true.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Not making any headway,
[53:20] &gt;&gt; not not going anywhere, not doing
[53:22] anything. Just drifting,
[53:24] &gt;&gt; just drifting along. But look, you you
[53:27] see the them falls are just down the
[53:29] road down there. THERE'S COMING THERE'S
[53:31] COMING A PLACE. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
[53:33] THAT motor running.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; If you're a daddy, don't drift long
[53:36] because your family's going to depend on
[53:38] you having a motor.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz your family will come into something
[53:41] you're going to need to pull them out
[53:42] of.
[53:44] I'm telling you, YOU GOT TO, BROTHERS,
[53:46] YOU got to lead your homes.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; You can't just YOU CAN'T JUST EXPECT
[53:51] your wife to pull you to church and pull
[53:53] you to prayer and pull you. We need
[53:55] leaders.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; I I'm not fussing. We need leaders.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "My children are young. They
[54:03] won't be there long."
[54:06] &gt;&gt; We need leaders. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[54:08] SAYS HE FINALLY REPENTED TO the Lord. He
[54:10] said, "Lord, I know where I made
[54:12] mistake."
[54:13] He called them holy rollers trash.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, they're just a
[54:21] bunch of shouting holy rollers down
[54:22] there. You better be careful."
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Lord, I didn't even
[54:28] say it. My mother-in-law did."
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Remember? Well, I'd hate to been his
[54:32] mother-in-law.
[54:34] Poor mother-in-laws. Sister Dee, I
[54:37] called her a cow one time.
[54:42] I got to talk about marriage. You know,
[54:44] Brother Bram said, "If you want to marry
[54:45] a calf," he said, "Look right at the
[54:47] cow."
[54:51] And I was dumb enough to say she's a
[54:52] good cow.
[54:55] [Music]
[55:00] Dee was an exc is is an excellent mother
[55:04] and an excellent wife, an excellent
[55:06] homemaker,
[55:07] an excellent character.
[55:10] You know, that's that's when I when uh
[55:12] when Zach come uh uh come home one day
[55:15] had this red-headed girl on his mind. I
[55:17] didn't know her from anybody. He comes
[55:20] home said, "Dad, I met her." I said,
[55:22] "Who's that son?" My wife.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You talk to her? Well, a little.
[55:30] It's about the way it went. And he says,
[55:33] he says, "Uh, you you you okay with it?"
[55:36] And I said, "Son, I ain't marrying her.
[55:37] You are.
[55:40] [Music]
[55:42] I mean, I'd like to like her, but you're
[55:43] the one living with her."
[55:46] So, he said, "Well, I want her parents
[55:48] to meet y'all." So, they come down at
[55:50] the house and Brother Mike, Sister Don,
[55:52] I'd never met him before., you know,
[55:53] they come to the church once or twice
[55:55] and I had seen them, but I never met
[55:56] them. They come to the house and we sit
[55:58] around there a few minutes and sister
[55:59] Don got to talking and she got to
[56:02] talking a little bit and I got to
[56:03] hearing biblical principles of womenhood
[56:06] and biblical principle was this and this
[56:08] and I got to hearing some real strong
[56:10] real strong moral uh background and
[56:14] biblical principle of what the the roles
[56:16] of wife and mother and what the world's
[56:19] doing to and I'm just listening and the
[56:21] Lord is just pouring out and the time I
[56:23] got done visiting with him about an hour
[56:25] I said son that that young lady will
[56:27] make you a good wife cuz she's been
[56:29] raised by somebody that gave her the
[56:31] right ambitions.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do do you see THEN THERE THERE'S
[56:35] GOT TO BE sometimes amen other people
[56:38] even in your life saying things about
[56:41] the the moving of the spirit.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Let me just let me just say this real
[56:47] clearly.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Be very careful when you go speaking
[56:51] about someone rejoicing.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Or dancing. or moving in the spirit.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Now, be real careful about it. And the
[57:00] reason I'm saying that to you is cuz
[57:02] Brother Bam said, "If you're planning,
[57:03] if your ambition is to go to heaven," he
[57:05] said, "you better range some of the
[57:06] language of heaven."
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That language over there
[57:09] is hallelujah and praise God."
[57:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "If it it's he said a little
[57:14] bit of shouting going over there." So,
[57:15] what it is is, see, you don't want to
[57:17] keep fading out that way. Crank the
[57:19] engine and quit that drift and pull
[57:22] back. Brother says it very clearly. I
[57:24] seen down there in hot springs that that
[57:26] group was headed towards organization.
[57:27] So I preached once more Lord.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother man Brandon WAS SAYING
[57:31] THAT THAT THEY HAD BEEN BUT THEY WAS
[57:33] DRIFTING AWAY. HOW MANY STORIES is that
[57:36] like that today? People that were so
[57:38] fervent for the Lord.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where some situation came and and
[57:42] they just begin to relax. Now let me let
[57:45] me just say the Ephesent church age.
[57:46] Brother Bram says it. He said they aimed
[57:48] at and relaxed. They had high
[57:50] aspirations of the age and begun to the
[57:52] fullness of the spirit, the depth of
[57:54] God. And they were aiming at the high
[57:56] calling and begin to give way to a less
[57:58] watchful attitude,
[58:01] &gt;&gt; a less adherent following of Jesus
[58:03] Christ began to manifest itself as an
[58:05] omen that in the future ages a physical
[58:07] vehicle called the church would sink to
[58:09] the awfulness of the depth of Satan. It
[58:11] had become relaxed and it was drifting.
[58:15] Now, Brother Ray preaches here a lot,
[58:17] and I preach here a lot on spiritual
[58:19] rest,
[58:21] &gt;&gt; but don't relax,
[58:24] [Music]
[58:26] &gt;&gt; don't don't get to the place where
[58:28] there's no strength in you.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Well, it's all over. I mean, you know,
[58:32] no, no. Keep the ambition.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Keep the ambition. Don't don't just
[58:38] relax to the place where you resigned.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Because when they become
[58:44] relaxed, they're drifting. Now, what's
[58:45] the first thing you drift away from? Is
[58:47] the supernatural.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; It becomes a carnal intellectual affair.
[58:52] When the pillar of fire is absent, then
[58:53] you just resort to reading.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; I know that's what the prophet said.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "And because there was the
[59:00] absence of the pillar of fire, they
[59:01] invited the most intellectual men they
[59:03] could get to fulfill and substitute the
[59:06] absence of the supernatural."
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:09] So when you begin to drift the the the
[59:11] the idea of miracles, the ideas of the
[59:15] power of God, you begin to drift away
[59:17] from it. And brother Bram says they
[59:19] began backsliding. They had left their
[59:22] first love. See, they had drifted and
[59:24] left their first love. Now I don't want
[59:26] to take a long time in that, but I would
[59:27] say this to you. Brother Bham says it in
[59:29] Revelations 2 and5. He said, "Remember
[59:31] which thou art fallen." What? Remember
[59:33] what you drifted away from. Look. And he
[59:36] says, "Now go back and do thy first
[59:38] works." Now watch. He said, "Now
[59:40] remember, evidently something had left
[59:42] their mind. They had forgotten." He told
[59:44] them to turn back in their minds at the
[59:46] point of origin. And that was the first
[59:48] age of Pentecost. They had fallen from
[59:50] that. They had forgotten the glory and
[59:53] the wonder of it. Isn't that something?
[59:55] It was time to go back in mind and then
[59:58] in reality back for them to say, "For me
[1:00:01] to live as Christ." Brother M says, "Go
[1:00:03] back there in YOUR MIND." SEE, HE SAID,
[1:00:05] and if you want to go on with it,
[1:00:06] brother Bam actually said, go back to
[1:00:08] the place. He said, you remember when
[1:00:11] things happened in the church and you
[1:00:12] didn't sit and talk about them, you
[1:00:14] prayed about them.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to rehearse. He
[1:00:18] said, remember when things would come up
[1:00:20] and you would go and forgive people and
[1:00:22] and you didn't want to go to sleep and
[1:00:24] having said something bad about somebody
[1:00:26] or owing somebody or not paying somebody
[1:00:28] or some kind of bad business deal. You
[1:00:31] know, you know that. Listen, folks.
[1:00:32] Amen. I believe a Christian is a
[1:00:34] Christian whether they're in the
[1:00:35] pullpit, the church, or the outdoors.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And if you do a business deal with
[1:00:41] somebody that don't come out right, that
[1:00:43] person shouldn't have to take you to
[1:00:44] court to make you pay that bill.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. I mean, y'all may not
[1:00:53] want me as a pastor, but I'm going to
[1:00:54] tell you this. I don't believe in this
[1:00:56] bunch of half-hearted Christian
[1:00:59] experience life where you where you buy
[1:01:01] things and don't pay for them or you do
[1:01:03] things and and you don't finish them or
[1:01:05] you take a job and you say I'll do this
[1:01:07] and then you don't do this and then you
[1:01:09] take the money for it.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And you never give the money back. You
[1:01:13] never go back and fix it. You never do
[1:01:15] it. Amen. It ain't Christian.
[1:01:17] [Applause]
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; it's the truth anyhow.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; I remember when men kept their word.
[1:01:25] I remember when you could just shake a
[1:01:27] man's hand and that's all you had to do.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; There's still some men like that, by the
[1:01:34] way.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; But when you fall away from that, that's
[1:01:38] you got to remember that's Christianity.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; It's not just church.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; It's alive.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; LOOK, YOU GOT TO GO back in your mind,
[1:01:48] then go back in reality. Now, I I
[1:01:50] certainly believe Brother Bam said he
[1:01:52] said there was a bunch of them out there
[1:01:53] on the on this on the on the ocean. He
[1:01:55] said they were drifting around. The fog
[1:01:57] came in. He said they got to getting
[1:01:59] scared and they got to want the old
[1:02:00] captain to do something. You move the
[1:02:02] boat right now. Brother Bam said that
[1:02:03] old captain been in that shape before.
[1:02:05] He said, "Hang on, boys." He said, "Just
[1:02:07] sit real still for a moment." He said,
[1:02:09] "And the great sun will come up in a
[1:02:11] minute and then we'll know our
[1:02:12] direction."
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Now, see, the church was setting in that
[1:02:16] kind of place in Pentecost. It had begun
[1:02:18] to move into confusion. But here come a
[1:02:21] prophet with a vindicated word and that
[1:02:24] would be the direction of OUR CHURCH.
[1:02:26] THAT THAT SON CAME UP AND NOW every
[1:02:29] captain on the on the on the church of
[1:02:31] the living God ought to know direction.
[1:02:33] Now direction is not one service.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Let's say that real clearly. Direction
[1:02:38] is not one service. You you you don't
[1:02:41] choose the church's direction by one
[1:02:43] good meeting, one bad meeting.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; One good sermon, one bad sermon. one
[1:02:47] good song, one bad song. You know, maybe
[1:02:49] somebody sang song you don't like. I
[1:02:50] think once it happens, you know,
[1:02:52] somebody will sang a song, somebody else
[1:02:53] don't like that song. But that don't
[1:02:55] mean it's the direction of Brother Ben's
[1:02:57] song service. Right.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; So, you can't you you can't label the
[1:03:01] direction of a song service because you
[1:03:03] heard one song you thought was too rocky
[1:03:06] or maybe it's too contemporary or
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; See, you can't you can't call our
[1:03:14] direction that direction cuz it's not
[1:03:16] that direction.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; It's one song.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; I thought I'd get more backing than
[1:03:22] that.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Let me preach to you young people. YOU
[1:03:25] CAN'T SAY WE'RE a bunch of old fogies
[1:03:27] just cuz we preach old rugged cross. If
[1:03:29] we sing uh Amazing Grace, you can't
[1:03:31] label us as a 1950s church off of one
[1:03:34] song.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hey y'all, is that better? You get the
[1:03:37] point?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; You can't take one song or one song
[1:03:40] service and label our song service as a
[1:03:43] certain way.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I I'm going to say something very
[1:03:45] clearly. I think we got wonderful song
[1:03:48] service here.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; I think Ben DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB HERE.
[1:03:52] He sings old ones. He sings new ones. He
[1:03:54] sings fast ones. He sings slow ones. HE
[1:03:56] SINGS WHATEVER THE SPIRIT is leading HIM
[1:03:59] INTO.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; AND I SAY, GOD BLESS HIM. AND YOU YOU
[1:04:02] just keep letting him lead YOU CUZ OUR
[1:04:05] AMBITION IS NOT TO BE LIKE ANOTHER
[1:04:07] CHURCH.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; OUR AMBITION IS TO FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP
[1:04:12] OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE POWER OF GOD
[1:04:15] AND DROP INTO A SERVICE AND A SONG
[1:04:17] SERVICE CAN BECOME A GLORY HOUSE.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; SHOUT THE VICTORY AND ENJOY THE PRESENCE
[1:04:23] OF GOD. WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF HUM DRUM.
[1:04:25] AMEN. HALFBAKED CHRISTIANS. WE'RE SONS
[1:04:27] AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, BORN TO THE HOLY
[1:04:30] GHOST, TONGUE TALKING. ACTS 2:38,
[1:04:32] CHILDREN OF THE living God.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; So, we have a good shouting service.
[1:04:41] Somebody say, "Well, they're all
[1:04:42] Pentecostal." Well, hang on. Here comes
[1:04:43] the teaching service.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Well, they preach on all they preach on
[1:04:49] is grace. Well,
[1:04:52] hang on. It's coming.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; See, because somebody else is leading,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; The direction the direction is
[1:05:03] leadership.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; And and you watch this. I I I I say this
[1:05:06] something Brother Bram said made me made
[1:05:08] me just really He taught us how to get
[1:05:10] direction, right? How to how to get
[1:05:11] balance because that's what everybody
[1:05:12] wants is balance.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; And and I want balance.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; But you got to be careful because you
[1:05:18] may not be the right balance yourself.
[1:05:25] Now you may lean, right?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And if you balance me by you,
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; I guess the whole church will
[1:05:40] direction. Now, Brother Bam talks about
[1:05:42] riding the bike, right? He he says that
[1:05:44] that that boy wanted to win that swin
[1:05:46] bike, so he he rode it across there. And
[1:05:48] that one little boy, they didn't expect
[1:05:49] him to win. All these other guys, they
[1:05:52] fell off left and right and they got to
[1:05:54] the end and they they interviewed the
[1:05:56] little boy. They said, "Well, you
[1:05:57] surprising Lee with a guy who rode the
[1:05:59] whole who rode the beam. What was your
[1:06:02] secret?" He said, "Well, if you notice
[1:06:03] those other guys," he said they were
[1:06:06] looking down trying to balance.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; So, what they were doing was if they
[1:06:12] leaned a little this way, they was
[1:06:13] correcting.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; So, they started in a wobble. All right.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Now, that's called reactive leadership.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; If the church has a little shouting
[1:06:23] meeting, then I come back and try to
[1:06:24] say, "We don't shout."
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And then they turn into Baptist. Then I
[1:06:27] got to come back and say, "Well, we're
[1:06:28] not Baptist."
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Then you see what you turn into a you
[1:06:32] turn into a wobbling
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; church.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; But direction is is when you set your
[1:06:38] ambition a little higher than one
[1:06:40] service
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; and you look out toward the end and you
[1:06:44] go, "This is the path." Yes, sir.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; See, the direction of this church is
[1:06:48] rapture.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; That's the direction. We're going in the
[1:06:52] rapture.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Shouting or not.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; HIGH, LOW, WHATEVER, WE'RE GOING IN THE
[1:06:59] RAPTURE.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT'S GOING TO GET US THERE IS THIS
[1:07:02] MESSAGE.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE GOING TO STAY RIGHT ON THE
[1:07:05] MESSAGE.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; SO, if something gets a little this way
[1:07:10] or something a LITTLE THIS WAY, HANG ON.
[1:07:12] YEAH. YEAH.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; IT'LL IT'LL IT'LL PULL ITSELF IN THE
[1:07:15] CENTER.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Because it's not in the intent to go a
[1:07:21] direction,
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; you would have to intentionally change
[1:07:24] the direction of a church
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; and it's not in our intent. See what you
[1:07:30] find then when you get into ambition,
[1:07:33] you you get into attitude.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; So your ambition will reflect your
[1:07:40] attitude will reflect your ambition. So,
[1:07:42] you know, people say ambitious and
[1:07:43] zealous are the same thing. They're
[1:07:44] actually not.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Ambition deals with the goal, zeal deals
[1:07:49] with the attitude.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; So, you can be have an ambition but not
[1:07:53] have no zeal about that ambition.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; So, your attitude and your ambition
[1:07:57] moves right together. Uh, eagle stare at
[1:07:59] his nest. Brother Nathan gave me this.
[1:08:01] It's a powerful quote. I just love it.
[1:08:03] Brother Bam says God likened his church
[1:08:05] under the eagle because the eagle's nest
[1:08:07] which is the church is built far beyond
[1:08:08] the cares of the world and out of the
[1:08:10] danger lines cross the blood where the
[1:08:12] modern prowling predators never got to.
[1:08:14] You are a city that is set on a hill a
[1:08:17] candle that's lit in the room owe
[1:08:19] something. The church of the living God
[1:08:21] is built high on high ambitions.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; When I hear the church that hasn't got
[1:08:26] any ambition to grow, there's something
[1:08:28] wrong with that church.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. The church of the living
[1:08:32] God has a high ambition. And another
[1:08:35] thing, the church of the living God is
[1:08:36] built because it's got high
[1:08:38] anticipations and expectations. Well, we
[1:08:41] belong to the church. Our father served
[1:08:43] in this church years ago. That might be
[1:08:44] fine. But the church of the living God
[1:08:47] can set still. Its ambitions is to go
[1:08:50] higher.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; See, we we have an ambition. It's a
[1:08:53] spiritual ambition is to go higher. Now,
[1:08:55] I I I think it's I think it's amazing
[1:08:58] when you start talking about stuff like
[1:08:59] this because you you just take a moment
[1:09:02] and you realize that the devil himself
[1:09:05] wants to go where you're going.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; IN ISAIAH, IT SAYS IT VERY CLEARLY. IT
[1:09:12] SAYS THAT HE HAD A DESIRE TO GO SIT ON
[1:09:15] THE THRONE OF GOD.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; BUT Satan's ambition to sit on the
[1:09:20] throne of God was to bring worship to
[1:09:22] HIMSELF AND GO HIGHER than God. But you
[1:09:24] have an ambition to go to the throne of
[1:09:26] God because you want to surrender to God
[1:09:29] and you WANT TO SERVE GOD. SEE, YOU YOU
[1:09:31] YOU IT'S AMAZING. IT'S AMAZING. I I I I
[1:09:34] I don't maybe I hope I don't get too
[1:09:37] loose in saying this, but I just got
[1:09:39] thinking about this. You know, you you
[1:09:40] you take a maybe a a woman that wants a
[1:09:43] certain man for husband, and she gets an
[1:09:45] ambition. I want this man for her
[1:09:46] husband. Well, if he's already got a
[1:09:48] wife,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; That could be a problem.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; So, you're you do you see then your
[1:10:01] ambition needs it needs a a reality
[1:10:05] behind it.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; You know, you you you you need that to
[1:10:10] have a HAVE A GOAL. AND OUR our
[1:10:12] expectations, our ambitions, our desires
[1:10:16] happened to be promises God made us.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And he SAID TO THE OVERCOMER, I WILL
[1:10:21] GRANT to set with me on my throne.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; He said in Revelations 20 that he saw
[1:10:25] thrones and they set up on them. So
[1:10:26] there's a right kind of ambition. AND
[1:10:29] PAUL'S AMBITION, IT WAS THAT HE SAID
[1:10:31] THAT I may be accepted of him.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself said, "My food is to do
[1:10:37] the will of God, him that sent me."
[1:10:39] great spiritual ambitions. Now Paul
[1:10:42] himself counted everything for loss
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the ambition of his life.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Go to Philippians chapter 3 and verse 8.
[1:10:52] Yeah, doubtless I count all things but
[1:10:53] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[1:10:55] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've
[1:10:57] suffered the loss of all things.
[1:11:02] For whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:11:05] things,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; and do count them but dung, that I may
[1:11:08] win Christ,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; and be found in him, not having mine own
[1:11:12] righteousnesses, which is of the law,
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; but that which is through the faith of
[1:11:17] Christ, the righteousness which is of
[1:11:19] God by faith, that I may know him, and
[1:11:23] the power of his resurrection, and the
[1:11:25] fellowship of his sufferings, being made
[1:11:27] conformable unto death, if by any means
[1:11:30] I might attain the resurrection of the
[1:11:33] dead. He wanted that rapture, that
[1:11:34] resurrection. Not as though I had
[1:11:37] already attained. I love how Paul says
[1:11:39] this.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Either were we already perfect, but I
[1:11:42] follow this pattern,
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; but I follow after, if that I may
[1:11:47] apprehend that which from I apprehended
[1:11:49] of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not
[1:11:52] myself to have apprehended, but this one
[1:11:54] thing I do, forgetting the things which
[1:11:56] are behind me,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; and reaching under things which are
[1:12:00] before me.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark of the high
[1:12:03] calling. Isn't that something? If you
[1:12:05] have the right ambition, you can
[1:12:07] forgive.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; If you have the right ambition, you can
[1:12:11] forgive.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Listen, if your ambition is is is that
[1:12:14] you got to get somebody back because you
[1:12:16] got to feel it's justified. If that's
[1:12:18] your ambition in life, do you see that?
[1:12:20] That turns into a real raw life.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't think anybody's got that
[1:12:27] ambition here. But you do you recognize
[1:12:29] then if it's not your ambition, why you
[1:12:32] let a grudge carry with you?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; See, if it's if it's not your ambition
[1:12:37] to destroy or hurt someone, then why
[1:12:40] would you ever carry a grudge more than
[1:12:42] two minutes?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WHY WOULD YOU EVEN PACK it alone
[1:12:47] with you? See, if you if you start
[1:12:50] seeing that in ambition, okay, I have
[1:12:52] this ambition. I want to go. I I've said
[1:12:54] this through the years. People will say
[1:12:57] things to a preacher that you shouldn't
[1:12:59] say to the devil, I think. Uh I know
[1:13:02] nobody's ever said anything to you.
[1:13:03] Probably just me.
[1:13:06] But but sometime I'm I'm straight
[1:13:08] serious now. Sometimes I'm God and
[1:13:10] sometimes I'm the devil.
[1:13:12] And sometimes I get called the devil for
[1:13:14] something I didn't even do or think.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Don't feel sorry for me. It's okay.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; God called me to it. So
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; So people say, "Well, how in the world
[1:13:28] you treat a person the same
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; after they talk to you like that?" Well,
[1:13:33] what it is is I have this pocket full of
[1:13:36] invisible passes.
[1:13:39] And this is a little thing between me
[1:13:41] and the Lord. You're his child and I'm
[1:13:44] his servant. So if someone says
[1:13:47] something to me that's not nice or
[1:13:49] unkind or it's brusky or whatever it
[1:13:53] could be and and you know sometimes I'm
[1:13:55] tender. That's something else about
[1:13:57] preachers y'all don't know that
[1:13:59] sometimes they're babies.
[1:14:01] It's just the truth. Sometimes they're
[1:14:04] so
[1:14:08] Sometimes you don't have to work to hurt
[1:14:09] their feelings. I'm gonna come over
[1:14:12] here.
[1:14:17] You don't have to You don't have to try,
[1:14:18] you know.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Well, so I've carried these passes in my
[1:14:24] pocket. If somebody says or does
[1:14:25] something that I even if I even think it
[1:14:28] could be and it's going to bother me a
[1:14:29] little bit, I just pick out my pocket. I
[1:14:32] just hand it to them and walk off. And
[1:14:35] when I walk off, I gave them pass. It's
[1:14:36] cool. We're good.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And I forget about it.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Because because I can't
[1:14:44] carry that
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; and be who I am. Right.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't I I cannot come before
[1:14:53] you people and preach with an open heart
[1:14:55] and carrying grudges against people and
[1:14:58] and offenses and things cuz I promise
[1:15:00] you it'd come out. They promise you it'd
[1:15:03] come out.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; See, but you you you can't carry that in
[1:15:07] your heart. You got TO BE FREE. THAT'S
[1:15:09] WHY THE BIBLE SAID WHEN HEBREWS 12, PAUL
[1:15:11] SAID, "SEEING that you WERE COMPASSED BY
[1:15:13] GREAT WITNESSES, let us lay aside every
[1:15:15] weight and sin that so be easily besets
[1:15:18] us that we can run this race with
[1:15:20] patience that is set before us."
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us lay aside. I WONDER RIGHT
[1:15:26] NOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING that you can
[1:15:27] lay aside
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; if for the sake OF CHRIST, FOR THE CAUSE
[1:15:32] OF SUNSHIP, for the CAUSE OF SHOWING THE
[1:15:35] CHARACTER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. IF IF THAT'S
[1:15:38] IF THAT'S IN YOUR HEART, I WANT THE
[1:15:40] AMBITION OF ADOPTION. I WANT THE
[1:15:41] AMBITION OF representing Jesus Christ.
[1:15:44] Lord, there's a couple things this
[1:15:46] morning I need to lay aside. I I got a
[1:15:48] little prejudice. I've got my feelings a
[1:15:50] little hurt. THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
[1:15:52] DOWN IN MY SPIRIT THAT I I JUST CAN'T
[1:15:54] WORK OUT. WELL, LOOK, SOMETIMES YOU
[1:15:56] CAN'T GET ANSWERS.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to preach A MINUTE,
[1:16:00] FOLKS. SOMETIMES THERE IS NO ANSWER.
[1:16:03] SOMETIMES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET IN
[1:16:05] GLORY BEFORE WE EVER UNDERSTAND SOME OF
[1:16:08] THE SITUATIONS. BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW,
[1:16:10] all things work together FOR THE GOOD OF
[1:16:13] THEM that love God and are CALLED
[1:16:15] ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. AND IF
[1:16:17] SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING TO YOU EVIL, GOD
[1:16:20] will make it turn out for your good.
[1:16:22] Because character is not A GIFT. IT IS A
[1:16:26] VICTORY. AND YOU GOT TO SUFFER TO HAVE
[1:16:28] CHARACTER. AND WE HAVE TAUGHT OUR
[1:16:31] CHILDREN TO CLAP. and we've taught them
[1:16:32] to love AND WE'VE GAVE THEM THINGS BUT
[1:16:35] DID WE TEACH THEM TO SUFFER? SOMETIMES
[1:16:37] OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SUFFERED AND
[1:16:40] THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT SUFFERING MEANS.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; We try to make sure nobody says nothing
[1:16:48] bad to them.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; You know may we we we make but you know
[1:16:54] honestly
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; sometimes people need to learn how to
[1:16:58] deal with a with a with a confrontation.
[1:17:01] That's right.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; They need to learn how to deal with
[1:17:02] somebody hurting their feelings and how
[1:17:04] to how to man up and say, "You know
[1:17:05] what? I didn't deserve that, but but I'm
[1:17:08] sorry I made you feel that way."
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; You got to get through life, folks. It's
[1:17:13] going to be a short victory if you try
[1:17:14] to cut around suffering.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; You're going to find yourself in a waste
[1:17:18] pile somewhere if you can't motor out of
[1:17:20] that.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see what it is? Amen.
[1:17:23] There's a joy that's set before him.
[1:17:25] JESUS TOOK THE CROSS for that joy. Amen.
[1:17:28] LAYING ASIDE. I I BELIEVE THIS MORNING
[1:17:30] THAT there there are there are things
[1:17:31] that are going on, amen, that you know,
[1:17:34] Amen. And I I I called it cake to to
[1:17:37] kind of help people a little bit, but
[1:17:38] there's there's besetting sins that are
[1:17:41] following people's lives.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:17:49] y'all probably ready for me to quit, but
[1:17:50] now
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; they're hindering you.
[1:17:56] Yes.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; They're not taking your salvation.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; They're just making you ineffective.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to say something real
[1:18:07] clear. I remember when I was a kid,
[1:18:08] somebody told me that if you had a
[1:18:10] television in your house, you'd hell.
[1:18:12] And I often thought, how in the world
[1:18:14] can that be?
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm not for televisions. I I just
[1:18:19] want to say something real clear,
[1:18:20] though.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; If you give that kind of power to a
[1:18:23] television, you ain't give much power to
[1:18:24] the blood yet.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it has that kind of
[1:18:30] power.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what it'll do. It'll sap
[1:18:32] your victory.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; It'll take the spiritual side of your
[1:18:37] life away from you.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; It'll make you ineffective as a
[1:18:40] Christian
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; because that's the center point. And and
[1:18:44] and I I could I could get real deep here
[1:18:46] because it it used to, Brother Isaac, it
[1:18:49] used to be we could preach on them
[1:18:50] televisions, man.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Then everybody's got one in their
[1:18:54] pocket.
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:02] So, so, so you see what happens to law.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; It can't be a law.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; It has to be a law in your heart.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I just don't want this. I don't desire
[1:19:15] this. I want to be a real Christian. I I
[1:19:17] want to move forward into Christ. You
[1:19:19] see what it is? LAY ASIDE. SEE, BEES
[1:19:21] SETTING SINS. THAT'S how men get so
[1:19:23] hooked in this pornography.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I used to think it's just men, but it
[1:19:29] ain't.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's girls.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne, you ought not talk about
[1:19:34] that that in church, you know. Well, you
[1:19:36] know, sometimes I think we need to.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we NEED TO EXPOSE THAT
[1:19:43] AND TELL YOU, I don't think you're lost.
[1:19:45] I think you need to come TO THE LORD AND
[1:19:47] HAVE A TALK ABOUT THIS AND GET THAT OUT
[1:19:49] OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; COME ON. AMEN. DON'T DON'T DON'T THROW
[1:19:53] AWAY YOUR LIFE BECAUSE you watched A BAD
[1:19:56] FILM. DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR MARRIAGE
[1:19:58] BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN SOMETHING WRONG.
[1:20:00] THROW THAT AWAY AND FALL IN LOVE WITH
[1:20:03] JESUS AGAIN AND BRING THE CLEANNESS BACK
[1:20:05] TO YOUR HOME.
[1:20:08] DON'T QUIT CHURCH OVER IT. COME ON.
[1:20:11] DON'T QUIT CHURCH OVER SOME BAD FILM YOU
[1:20:13] WATCH. THROW THAT FILM AWAY AND COME ON
[1:20:16] BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND LOVE THE
[1:20:19] LORD. REDEDICATE YOUR LIFE.
[1:20:23] YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO, COME AND
[1:20:25] TALK TO ME. WE won't throw you away.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; We'll love you through it.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not into human disposal. I don't
[1:20:33] throw humans away.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; You're too valuable to my Lord.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; But I hate to see someone bound in that
[1:20:40] kind of thing. See, we're not running
[1:20:42] this race, Amen, just just for a day.
[1:20:45] We're running this race, amen, that we
[1:20:47] might receive a a incorruptible crown
[1:20:50] with the Lord. You know, DL Moody
[1:20:53] actually says something. He said, "The
[1:20:54] world is yet to see what God can do with
[1:20:56] one man fully surrendered to him."
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Will you be that person?
[1:21:02] Now, Dion Moody was reported to have
[1:21:05] said it, but originally it was said by
[1:21:07] Henry Vley, which tells you a British
[1:21:09] revivalist inspired a man that he come
[1:21:12] so inspired by that statement that he
[1:21:14] used it a lot of times in his own
[1:21:15] ministry. And then and then DL Moody
[1:21:18] began to say, "By God's help, I'll be
[1:21:20] that man."
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; See, the world doesn't realize what it
[1:21:24] would be for a man to come fully
[1:21:26] surrendered to God. I love how Brother
[1:21:28] Brandham says, he said, "You give me
[1:21:29] just two good members in a church that's
[1:21:31] really on fire for God. And it'll do
[1:21:33] something for that church that more than
[1:21:35] 40 revivals could do. WE COULD HAVE 40
[1:21:38] REVIVAL MEETINGS, BUT TWO OF YOU ON FIRE
[1:21:41] FOR God can do MORE FOR THIS CHURCH THAN
[1:21:44] 40 REVIVALS CAN DO." I SAID, "GOD, LET
[1:21:47] ME BE one of them ON FIRE. WOULD
[1:21:49] SOMEBODY ELSE COME WITH ME? I WANT TO BE
[1:21:51] ON FIRE. I WANT TO BE SO ON FIRE WITH
[1:21:54] GOD UNTIL THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN TAKE A
[1:21:56] HOLD OF ME AND USE me in his glory.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Y'all know Brother Bam said it. It
[1:22:01] wasn't me that done them miracles. It
[1:22:03] wasn't me that spoke those squirrels. It
[1:22:05] wasn't me on the river. He said it's
[1:22:07] what I surrendered myself to. And let me
[1:22:10] say this TO YOU. THAT SAME ANGEL THAT
[1:22:12] WAS AT THAT RIVER THAT WAS IN THOSE
[1:22:14] MEETINGS is right here IN THIS BUILDING
[1:22:17] RIGHT NOW. AND HE'S DESIRING A
[1:22:19] SURRENDERED HEART. AND I SAY, "LORD, I
[1:22:22] WANT TO BE THAT ONE. I WANT TO GET OUT
[1:22:24] OF THE WAY. LORD, I WANT TO LAY ASIDE
[1:22:27] EVERY SIN, everything that would beset
[1:22:29] ME. LAY IT ASIDE BECAUSE IT'S my
[1:22:31] ambition to BE MORE THAN JUST A
[1:22:33] PREACHER. I WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; I want to be more THAN A PREACHER.
[1:22:39] BROTHER AEN, I WANT TO BE MORE THAN JUST
[1:22:41] A PREACHER. I WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I
[1:22:44] WANT TO BE A MAN THAT LIVES FOR GOD. I
[1:22:46] WANT MY FAMILY TO SEE A GODLY CHRISTIAN
[1:22:49] MAN, NOT JUST A PREACHER BEHIND THE
[1:22:51] PULLPIT.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; LOOK, WHEN I GOT SAVED, GOD MADE ME A
[1:22:56] CHRISTIAN AND THEN I become a preacher.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Why is it that when I become a preacher,
[1:23:01] Amen, that I'm not supposed to be a
[1:23:03] Christian?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; That's a hard one for me.
[1:23:14] Do you see responsibility? I was we was
[1:23:18] up at uh we was up at that bow shoot
[1:23:20] where brother Chuck and him they have
[1:23:22] every year and uh I was up there this
[1:23:24] year. I think it was Andrew Glover. Did
[1:23:26] Andrew preach the last one we had?
[1:23:28] Andrew preach the last one. I was
[1:23:29] actually praying about something when I
[1:23:30] was up there and I was praying about
[1:23:32] church attendance. You know, I was just
[1:23:34] thinking cuz I can be a little legalist
[1:23:36] about church. I I know that I'm I'm I'm
[1:23:39] already past that. Brother Bam said, "If
[1:23:40] you're going to be a legalist, be a
[1:23:41] legalist about that."
[1:23:45] Go look it up.
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:50] I could be a little legal about that,
[1:23:51] but but I have my own experiences. So,
[1:23:53] it it Hey, I need church.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I need it. I mean, some of y'all some of
[1:23:58] y'all I know, but I need church. Uh but
[1:24:03] but I I was thinking I was praying about
[1:24:05] that and you know I I've adopted a I I
[1:24:07] feel like a good attitude about church
[1:24:09] attendance. I do do y'all feel like I
[1:24:10] have a good attitude about it.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Like if you can't come to church I don't
[1:24:13] bug you about it, do I?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; I don't I mean you know I don't think I
[1:24:18] do. I I I kind of feel bad if I say much
[1:24:21] about it and I've adopted brother
[1:24:23] brother A was always that way. He's like
[1:24:25] well if you miss a Sunday I don't think
[1:24:26] you'll miss rapture.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And I don't think so either. It's not
[1:24:30] what I'm talking about.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; But but responsibility of setting church
[1:24:35] attendance in your family.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; See, if if you set a goal in your family
[1:24:41] that anything that comes up, church is
[1:24:44] on the back burner,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; then you're raising a family
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; that will approach church the same way.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; And in a generation when church
[1:24:54] attendance is so so uh forsaken,
[1:24:59] See, you don't want to put that seed or
[1:25:02] ambition in your in your children or
[1:25:04] your family.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm saying that because I was
[1:25:07] actually sitting there at that bow shoot
[1:25:09] and I was praying about this and I said,
[1:25:10] "Lord, have I been too lax about this?
[1:25:13] Am I am I too?" Because it was just
[1:25:15] bothering me and I was just praying
[1:25:17] about it and Andrew got up and preached
[1:25:19] and he says, you know, he's talking
[1:25:20] about men. and he's talking about the
[1:25:21] responsibility. And he said, "Look, God
[1:25:24] has given you a responsibility
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; to be in the house of God."
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And when I heard him say that, I
[1:25:30] realized it don't matter what attitude I
[1:25:32] take toward it.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I didn't give you the responsibility to
[1:25:36] be at church this morning.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; It it it I didn't I didn't I didn't It's
[1:25:41] not my responsibility.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; It's I didn't give that responsibility
[1:25:45] to you.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; God gave that to you. That's right.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; See, God gave you responsibility to come
[1:25:52] to the house of the Lord. And to fulfill
[1:25:54] those responsibilities shows a godly
[1:25:56] character.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; It shows an ambition.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; But when you get relaxed and resigned
[1:26:03] when you start backsliding, church
[1:26:05] attendance is the first thing that goes.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell me somebody's
[1:26:10] backsliding when they can't come to the
[1:26:11] church half the time.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; You I don't have to ask. I can see.
[1:26:18] So when WHEN YOU FEEL YOURSELF PULLING
[1:26:20] BACK FROM THE BODY, ask yourself, what
[1:26:23] am I doing?
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Is that far enough?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Man, I feel like a pastor this morning,
[1:26:35] brother.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; I don't even feel bad about it either.
[1:26:40] It's kind of like It's kind of like, you
[1:26:42] know, it's kind of like my my wife was
[1:26:45] whipping my kid one day and and they
[1:26:47] said, "Mom, don't you going to say that
[1:26:48] hurts me worse it does you?" She said,
[1:26:49] "It don't, THOUGH.
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:56] You guys are amazing. You guys are
[1:26:59] amazing."
[1:27:01] But it's our ambition.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; It's the ambition of our hearts. It's
[1:27:06] not what somebody's making us do. Right.
[1:27:08] Right.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; It's a self set it's a self- set goal
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; and it affects our attitude. And our
[1:27:14] attitude is is to is to overcome or to
[1:27:18] recognize the devil. And if you can
[1:27:20] overcome and recognize the devil, then
[1:27:22] you got to stand up to him.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; You have to stand up to the devil. See,
[1:27:27] and you have to resist the devil. Do
[1:27:29] y'all know if you resist the devil,
[1:27:31] he'll flee from you.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? IF YOU RESIST THE
[1:27:35] DEVIL, he will flee from you. And
[1:27:37] brother Bam said HE WILL BECOME
[1:27:38] POWERLESS BEFORE YOU.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; He'll become power. Think about that,
[1:27:43] man. AMEN. SATAN BECOMES POWERLESS when
[1:27:46] you begin TO RESIST.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; I SAY WE NEED A RESISTANCE.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; WE NEED A RESISTANCE TO A COLD AND
[1:27:53] LUKEWARM CONDITION IN THE AGE OF WE NEED
[1:27:56] A RESISTANCE OF WAR AND REBELLION.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY IT? WE NEED A PROTEST.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO PROTEST COLD CHURCH. WE NEED
[1:28:05] TO PROTEST DEAD RELIGION. AMEN. I don't
[1:28:07] know about y'all. I AM SICK of dead
[1:28:09] religion. I'VE HAD ALL THE DEAD RELIGION
[1:28:11] I want. I've got all THE TRADITION I
[1:28:14] WANT. I WANT AN EXPERIENCE WITH A LIVING
[1:28:16] GOD MANIFESTING HIMSELF IN THE POWER OF
[1:28:20] HIS RESURRECTION. I WANT A REAL GOD. I
[1:28:24] WANT A GOD THAT CAN HEAL OUR BABIES. I
[1:28:26] WANT A GOD THAT CAN CHANGE LIVES. I WANT
[1:28:28] A GOD THAT CAN DELIVER HEARTS. I WANT TO
[1:28:31] SEE GOD. I WANT TO SEE THE GOD OF THE
[1:28:34] BIBLE. I WANT TO SEE WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S
[1:28:36] GOD. I WANT TO SEE ELIJAH'S GOD. I WANT
[1:28:39] TO SEE THE GOD THAT WROTE THIS BIBLE,
[1:28:42] LIVE THIS BIBLE IN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE,
[1:28:45] IN THESE HEARTS, IN THESE LIVES. AND WE
[1:28:47] CANNOT GET THERE ON A LOUD sin message.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; It'll take this word. It'll take this
[1:28:54] word on word on word. And if you begin
[1:28:57] to resist and you begin to protest this
[1:28:59] devil, you can sit here this morning and
[1:29:02] bind every spirit that is holding you
[1:29:04] and you can bind it. You can bind the
[1:29:07] devil. You can bind your complexes.
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; You can declare the word over that
[1:29:15] thing.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; I've got a couple things on my heart. I
[1:29:19] hope I don't get too long. Forgive me.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; I think we need to resist it.
[1:29:27] I think we need to resist it.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; You say resist what? That stubborn
[1:29:32] spirit.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You say something about me not coming to
[1:29:35] church and I'll not come to church for a
[1:29:37] month.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; You need to kill that devil right now.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing more than a stubborn
[1:29:45] devil and you never got it from God.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I saved and been
[1:29:50] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:52] How do I get away from a stubborn spirit
[1:29:54] that I can't seem to break away from?
[1:29:56] Well, my Christian brother or sister,
[1:29:58] most of the times you'll find people
[1:29:59] that's got a stubborn spirit. Usually,
[1:30:01] it's a complex. Either they've inherited
[1:30:03] from a father, mother, uncle,
[1:30:04] grandfather, or grandparent, something
[1:30:06] like that. I found it discernment, he
[1:30:09] said. So, you know what that means? It
[1:30:11] don't belong to you.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; So, don't feel obligated to keep it.
[1:30:16] Yeah,
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; man. Zach moved out yesterday and I was
[1:30:20] helping him with his stuff.
[1:30:26] We got the whole family involved. Y'ALL
[1:30:27] HELP ZACH. WE HELPING HIM WITH HIS
[1:30:30] STUFF.
[1:30:32] Love you, son. HEY, LOOK. IF IT DON'T
[1:30:35] BELONG TO YOU, YOU AIN'T GOT TO STORE
[1:30:37] IT.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOT TO KEEP IT. YOU OWE THE
[1:30:40] DEVIL NO FAVORS.
[1:30:43] A STUBBORN SPIRIT IS HURTING your home.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; GIVE YOUR WIFE SOME ROOM. KICK THE DEVIL
[1:30:50] OUT.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; MAKE SOME ROOM. MAKE SOME ROOM for love
[1:30:53] and joy and peace and forgiveness.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; I think it's true. YOU YOU CAN RESIST
[1:31:00] THAT DEVIL.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; You can resist it as if it was an
[1:31:04] intruder into your home.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; You can resist THE DEVIL THAT IS TIED to
[1:31:09] complexes. He said, "If you will just
[1:31:11] ignore him and walk away from him, he
[1:31:13] can't hurt you.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; You can't hurt you. When you feel you
[1:31:19] got a stubborn spirit, lay the thing on
[1:31:21] the altar, believe God, and the thing is
[1:31:24] dead and you'll never have it no more."
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Resist that devil. He'll flee from you.
[1:31:30] He'll get away quickly. So, that would
[1:31:32] be my advice to overcome it, the devil
[1:31:34] by faith. That's how you overcome it, by
[1:31:36] faith. See, if you want to, now I hope
[1:31:40] you're following my channel.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; If you want more than temporary victory,
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; there's a rule to follow for this life.
[1:31:49] If you want a temporary victory, here's
[1:31:51] what you do. You take a deep breath and
[1:31:53] you count 10 times and you see your
[1:31:56] psychologist
[1:31:58] and he teaches you how to handle this.
[1:32:02] Or you could resist the devil
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; and he'll flee from you.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And if you want a permanent victory,
[1:32:10] that's how it comes.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I know. I KNOW MYSELF. AMEN. Did you
[1:32:14] just preach on temper?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Did you?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Did you touch it last week? This your
[1:32:19] fault.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; He's like, MAN, I AIN'T EVEN I AIN'T
[1:32:27] EVEN UP there and you're blaming THIS ON
[1:32:29] ME.
[1:32:34] I USED TO HAVE A temper that is a little
[1:32:36] bit I was 4 foot. Y'all told y'all that,
[1:32:38] didn't I?
[1:32:41] An alligator mouth and a bird body.
[1:32:45] I thought I was 6' tall and bulletproof
[1:32:46] and I really was 4' 10, 130 lbs. But if
[1:32:50] you don't think that I wouldn't tackle
[1:32:51] somebody as big as Nathan, you're crazy.
[1:32:54] I would tackle Nathan. Hey Amen. and
[1:32:56] brother Matt at the same time
[1:32:59] and throw brother Brian and I wouldn't
[1:33:01] even care.
[1:33:05] I'm serious. I never seen a man I
[1:33:07] couldn't whip
[1:33:09] when I was mad.
[1:33:13] You said, "What do you mean?" Well, I've
[1:33:15] been beat up a lot. Kicked, stomped, and
[1:33:16] everything else. But they never did beat
[1:33:18] me up.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz even if I had to tell them, I'll
[1:33:21] come back tomorrow.
[1:33:24] But it was a temper. It was a horrible
[1:33:26] temper.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; But you know what I did? I brought that
[1:33:29] thing to the Lord.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And he changed that temper.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK IT OUT OF ME. AND IT WASN'T IT
[1:33:36] WASN'T JUST for a week or but that's
[1:33:38] been 30 years ago.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; AND THAT TEMPER'S NOT IN MY life
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't a short-term victory.
[1:33:46] If you want more than a short-term
[1:33:47] victory, resist the devil
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; and he will flee from you. Now, if a
[1:33:53] person realizes they have an inferior
[1:33:55] complex or some sort of complex, how can
[1:33:57] they overcome this? If if he was only
[1:34:00] the child that caused this in early
[1:34:01] youth, see, you got to take the
[1:34:03] opposite.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; If you always want your
[1:34:08] your way
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; and that little
[1:34:13] and that one little brat that wants to
[1:34:16] always have everything your way, don't
[1:34:18] be a brat.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let somebody else pick where
[1:34:23] you're going to eat today.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I'm trying my best to make this light
[1:34:30] cuz it's
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; He's eating my lunch. Turn that right
[1:34:35] back around and give everything you got
[1:34:37] the other way.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; See, if you want stuff your way, stop
[1:34:42] asking for your way and give the other
[1:34:44] person. That's how you break that thing.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE SELFISH, GIVE SOMETHING
[1:34:49] AWAY.
[1:34:50] I'M GOING TO TELL on myself. One time I
[1:34:52] started paying ties before I was saved.
[1:34:54] And and I really did. I I I was a I was
[1:34:56] a sinner boy completely, but a tenth of
[1:34:58] my paycheck went down to the to the
[1:35:00] church every week. And and and after I
[1:35:03] got saved and we got tied on money, I
[1:35:05] got a little family and it got started
[1:35:06] getting tight on money, man. I got
[1:35:08] thinking I don't I just can't hardly
[1:35:09] afford to pay my ties. So, I got it got
[1:35:12] it got hard on me to do it. It really
[1:35:14] y'all y'all ever feel that? It just be
[1:35:17] it feels fine because you ain't really
[1:35:19] think you got enough money and didn't
[1:35:20] hear you giving you know and and man it
[1:35:22] was tearing me up and one day I said you
[1:35:25] know what devil I tell you what I'm just
[1:35:28] going to start paying 20% ties
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; that devil backed up quick
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; because I wasn't going to let that devil
[1:35:38] take me away from the blessing
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; because it was a selfish spirit telling
[1:35:43] me that I couldn't afford to give when I
[1:35:45] couldn't afford to not give.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I needed TO GIVE MORE RIGHT THEN THAN
[1:35:50] I'D EVER GAVE IN MY LIFE BECAUSE I
[1:35:52] NEEDED GOD'S BLESSING.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; It It's the truth. I I I I'm not
[1:35:57] preaching about money. I'm talking about
[1:35:59] something else alltogether. Killing the
[1:36:00] spirit. I remember this. I remember
[1:36:03] sitting on a platform of a church and I
[1:36:05] think I had a $50 bill, maybe $50 in
[1:36:08] hole in my pocket and that was all the
[1:36:10] money we had. and we had bills coming
[1:36:12] due and this and it was it's an odd way
[1:36:14] to thank folks but the offering plate
[1:36:16] come by and I looked my wallet and I had
[1:36:18] about this maybe $50 or so and I said
[1:36:21] you know what I don't have enough money
[1:36:22] to do nothing I can't pay nothing with
[1:36:25] this I said I'll tell you what I do I'm
[1:36:27] I just took the whole thing and put it
[1:36:28] in the offer and I said now Lord I'm
[1:36:30] broke you got to help me
[1:36:33] do you know I had about $250 before I
[1:36:36] left that platform that night
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; people just walked up and looked at me
[1:36:39] kind of odd and handed me
[1:36:43] I got down in the floor about a week
[1:36:45] later.
[1:36:46] This is true. And I had a I had a trip
[1:36:50] to make and I had to not only did I have
[1:36:52] to pay the bills I had because because
[1:36:54] as a full-time evangelist, see,
[1:36:56] sometimes you might not get back for 3
[1:36:58] weeks if you're on the road. And then
[1:37:00] back in them days, we couldn't deposit
[1:37:02] mobile. So you'd be out on the field and
[1:37:05] you might even have the money, but you
[1:37:06] didn't have the money at home to pay
[1:37:07] your bill. And you didn't want to lose
[1:37:08] your house while you was gone. So, you
[1:37:10] had to pay up one month or you had to
[1:37:12] get everything settled before you left.
[1:37:14] And I remember getting in the floor and
[1:37:16] I started praying. I said, "God, I know
[1:37:18] you called me to this ministry. I know
[1:37:20] you did, Lord. And you put this call in
[1:37:22] my life, but I financially cannot meet
[1:37:24] the requirements that I have obligated
[1:37:26] myself to." And they wasn't ex they
[1:37:29] wasn't exceeding. They were just simple
[1:37:31] obligations, just simple house payments.
[1:37:33] And and and I started praying. And I
[1:37:35] said, 'Lord, if you if you if you have
[1:37:38] called me this, I need your help, Lord.
[1:37:40] You know when I went down to church the
[1:37:41] next night, it was a home church. This
[1:37:43] never happens at your home church when
[1:37:44] you're an evangelist. But I was at the
[1:37:46] home church and Brother Vernon's brother
[1:37:48] walked up to me who was probably wasn't
[1:37:50] much better off financially than any of
[1:37:53] us was. And somehow they had gotten some
[1:37:55] little money in. And he walked over to
[1:37:57] ME AND SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, I WAS
[1:37:58] PRAYING LAST night and the Holy Spirit
[1:38:00] spoke to me and told me that you were in
[1:38:02] need of funds." and he said, "Told me to
[1:38:04] give you $500 here." Do you know that
[1:38:07] $500 was exactly what was needed to get
[1:38:09] me out of town?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; But you do you see when you decided to
[1:38:14] not be selfish, you opened yourself up
[1:38:16] that God could bless you.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Of course, some of you live by that. And
[1:38:21] you know why I'm telling you truth. I
[1:38:22] want a big amen from you.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And now look this. Now, now complexes
[1:38:28] are something. I'm I'm going to be
[1:38:29] closing pretty soon. Complexes are
[1:38:30] something. NOW WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IS
[1:38:32] THERE'S something wrong. See brother
[1:38:35] ma'am says I've wondered see one sets
[1:38:37] healed and one other not healed and then
[1:38:39] another one like this. There's something
[1:38:41] wrong somewhere. I think this is it's a
[1:38:42] complex that people build up especially
[1:38:45] people who's been sick a while. You know
[1:38:47] they begin. He said now you're going to
[1:38:48] resent me when I tell you this. Do you
[1:38:50] know a man died over brother talking
[1:38:52] about complexes in church.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; He got mad at brother Ram and died over
[1:38:56] him saying something about complex.
[1:38:59] Amen. God was merciful. He died in
[1:39:01] church. Brother Bam raised him back up.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a complex. See, and and
[1:39:05] Brother Bram says, "See, there's
[1:39:07] something wrong. I think a complex
[1:39:09] builds up." See, you'll resent this, but
[1:39:11] I'll tell you, it's true. You take a
[1:39:13] child that's been petted because it's to
[1:39:15] a place till it wants to be petted. It
[1:39:18] builds up a complex. And you can't do
[1:39:20] nothing with that child until you shake
[1:39:22] him up good. There's a time when a
[1:39:24] person gets sick and they become
[1:39:26] self-pied and they get into such a
[1:39:28] condition. said, "Well, I don't believe
[1:39:31] I feel any better." You know, you'll
[1:39:33] never feel any better like that.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; See, now that's not it. It is. See,
[1:39:38] that's not the attitude. You don't
[1:39:41] approach him at all like that.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; That's not the right sight. Don't have a
[1:39:45] complex. See, but come in with a burly
[1:39:48] robust faith. It's a settled thing. See,
[1:39:51] SEE A COMPLEX OF SELF-PITY, you're in a
[1:39:53] pitiful condition, and it's really true.
[1:39:56] But when you get to pitying yourself,
[1:39:58] you want everybody else to pity you
[1:40:00] also. And he said, I hit that spot one
[1:40:03] time. I was glad he said it like that.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; I hit that spot one time. He said, I was
[1:40:08] sitting there on the porch in a
[1:40:09] breakdown staying eight days in a
[1:40:11] meeting without coming to food or
[1:40:12] anything or sleep. I stayed on the
[1:40:14] platform and I got to a place that I
[1:40:16] didn't think I could ever feel any
[1:40:18] better.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I want you to I want you
[1:40:21] to hear me because this IS NOT JUST
[1:40:23] ABOUT NATURAL SICKNESS. There's
[1:40:25] sicknesses that move into the spiritual
[1:40:27] life that you don't think it's ever
[1:40:29] going to get any better.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it becomes a complex and you
[1:40:33] want somebody to pity you because YOU'RE
[1:40:35] SITTING THERE FEELING SORRY FOR
[1:40:37] YOURSELF. I've been in this so long and
[1:40:38] I've been through so MANY PRAYER LINES
[1:40:40] AND THAT THAT'S NOT THE ATTITUDE.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; IT'LL never overcome that. The only WAY
[1:40:45] TO OVERCOME IT, BROTHER MAN SAYS, "ONE
[1:40:47] DAY I heard the scream of that e that of
[1:40:50] that eagle, that Christian book called
[1:40:52] Christian confession by FF Bosworth."
[1:40:55] What is it? That that very book. Amen.
[1:40:58] Christian confession taught brother
[1:40:59] Brandham the law of confessing the word
[1:41:02] of God. And if it's in your ambition to
[1:41:04] get well, start confessing the word of
[1:41:07] God. IF IT'S YOUR AMBITION TO WALK OUT
[1:41:10] OF YOUR SICKNESS, START CONFESSING THE
[1:41:13] WORD OF GOD. IF IT'S YOUR AMBITION,
[1:41:15] AMEN, to leave THAT NERVOUS SPIRIT
[1:41:17] BEHIND, start confessing the word of
[1:41:20] God. If you WANT TO LET ANXIETY GET OUT
[1:41:22] OF YOUR LIFE, START CONFESSING THE WORD
[1:41:25] OF GOD. IF YOU WANT SIN OUT OF YOUR
[1:41:27] LIFE, START CONFESSING THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:41:30] THE HOLY SPIRIT IS HERE RIGHT NOW TO
[1:41:33] INSPIRE YOU TO SAY, YOU'RE SITTING THERE
[1:41:35] SAYING, "I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE THE HOLY
[1:41:37] GHOST. I don't know if I HAVE THE HOLY
[1:41:38] GHOST." CHANGE YOUR CONFESSION. HE GAVE
[1:41:41] you the HOLY GHOST. ALL YOU got to do is
[1:41:43] accept it right now. Say, "Lord, I
[1:41:46] accept that Holy Ghost." AND DON'T YOU
[1:41:48] EVER CHANGE THAT CONFESSION. YOU START
[1:41:50] TELLING EVERYBODY AROUND YOU, "GOD, GIVE
[1:41:52] ME THE HOLY GHOST." AND I'VE ACCEPTED
[1:41:54] THE HOLY GHOST. AND YOU WATCH GOD BEGIN
[1:41:57] TO MY GOODNESS, IT FEELS LIKE FIRE IN
[1:42:00] THIS BUILDING. YOU WATCH GOD BEGIN TO
[1:42:02] CHANGE. AMEN. THE LIFE COMPARED TO THE
[1:42:05] CONFESSION. But if you're walking
[1:42:06] around, I can't live very high. And
[1:42:08] brother Wayne, I can't get over this and
[1:42:10] I can't do this. Reb said, "Don't you
[1:42:12] ever take that negative confession.
[1:42:14] Don't you ever do it." AMEN. BUT IF
[1:42:16] YOU'LL TAKE A RIGHT mental attitude
[1:42:18] toward EVERY PROMISE OF GOD, IT WILL
[1:42:21] BRING IT TO PASS.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; YOU SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, WHAT IS THE
[1:42:24] RIGHT MENTAL ATTITUDE?" GLAD YOU ASKED.
[1:42:27] The word is a seed.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That's the attitude. I want an acron
[1:42:32] tree. I WANT AN OAK TREE. Here's an
[1:42:34] acron. Take your acron. Plant your
[1:42:36] acron. Water your acron. And you'll have
[1:42:38] an oak tree. You want A HEALING? ISAIAH
[1:42:41] 53, YOU ARE HEALED BY HIS STRIPES. BY
[1:42:44] HIS STRIPES, YOU ARE HEALED. THE BOOK OF
[1:42:46] PETER, JAMES CHAPTER 5 SAID, "LAY your
[1:42:49] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:42:52] recover." You begin to declare the word
[1:42:54] of God over that situation today, and it
[1:42:57] will not be a temporary victory. IT WILL
[1:43:00] NOT BE JUST A VICTORY AND GONE TOMORROW
[1:43:02] AND BACK THE NEXT DAY. IF YOU CAN
[1:43:04] OVERCOME BY FAITH, IT'S WHAT OVERCOMES
[1:43:07] THE WORLD. COME ON. YOU ARE NOT BOUND TO
[1:43:10] YOUR BIRTH. YOU ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS
[1:43:13] OF GOD COMING UP OUT OF THE MUDS OF
[1:43:16] LEADSIA INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE living
[1:43:19] God.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; We have an ambition and that ambition is
[1:43:22] full maturity. It's a total victory and
[1:43:25] we might have to lay aside some things
[1:43:27] to get there.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; But I say it's worth it.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; I say it's worth it. And if you can if
[1:43:36] you're if you're away from that today,
[1:43:38] why don't you remember what it was like?
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And brother said, go back in your mind
[1:43:43] and then go back in reality.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; If you can go back in your mind, can the
[1:43:48] music come? If you go back in your mind,
[1:43:51] you can begin to change your reality.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; If you can go back in your mind and you
[1:43:56] get your mind set on the things of God.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I tell I tell you, isn't that a powerful
[1:44:00] song? Y'all ever heard that? I'm so glad
[1:44:03] I got a mind that stayed on Jesus.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I got a mind that stayed on
[1:44:09] the Lord.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want no double mind.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; It'll affect your attitude. Now,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; your ambition will affect your attitude.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me it won't.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, they left Egypt
[1:44:26] and was headed to the promised land. And
[1:44:29] in the middle of miracles,
[1:44:31] in the middle of miracles, begin to
[1:44:34] murmur.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; They begin to complain and grumble. Look
[1:44:37] at their attitude.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they lost the
[1:44:41] vision of the promised land.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; And they let their minds drift back to
[1:44:46] the garlet pots of Egypt.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And while eating angel food, following a
[1:44:51] pillar of fire,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; they begin to murmur
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; because they lost their ambition. Right.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But look at Paul and Silas
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; praising in prison.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Praising in prison.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; One murmur in the middle of a miracle
[1:45:09] and another praises in a prison.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; It's attitude.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Wayne, you got an
[1:45:16] attitude." You bet I do.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; I got an attitude that we're going to
[1:45:20] make it.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; I got an attitude that you're going to
[1:45:24] make it. You're going to go all the way.
[1:45:26] I got an attitude. We're going to sit
[1:45:28] down together in glory and we're going
[1:45:30] to talk about it
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; and we're going to fellowship about it.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; And you're going to be reminded I
[1:45:34] wouldn't give up on you.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; There's some people in here, amen, that
[1:45:38] they they've been through some things
[1:45:39] and I've been through it with them.
[1:45:40] Amen. And they one thing they'll learn,
[1:45:42] I'm not going to give up on you.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to be able to tell me
[1:45:46] something that's going to make me throw
[1:45:47] you away.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You're too valuable.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; You're too valuable.
[1:45:55] You say, "Well, Wayne, I'm having I'm
[1:45:57] having issues and I I don't know how to
[1:45:59] get back." Listen, you're too valuable
[1:46:02] to be thrown away.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; So, get some help.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Don't just struggle alone. Don't
[1:46:08] struggle in silence.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Get some help.
[1:46:14] So, brother, I I I don't I I tell you
[1:46:16] what you do. You take the word of God,
[1:46:18] put it in your mouth, and start
[1:46:20] declaring over this thing.
[1:46:24] So, I got me a selfish spirit. Start
[1:46:26] giving some things away.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; I got me a hot temper. Well, get in
[1:46:30] prayer. It'll sweeten it.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; It'll sweeten it.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; So, by the way, what can we do? I tell
[1:46:38] you what we can do. We can give
[1:46:40] ourselves to him.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; We can know the word.
[1:46:47] We can pray and ask God for a spirit to
[1:46:49] quote the word.
[1:46:51] And then we're not going to suffer in
[1:46:52] silence. We're going to declare the
[1:46:54] word. Let the poor say that I'm rich.
[1:46:59] Let the weak say I'm strong.
[1:47:03] Do you see your ambition? I pray that
[1:47:06] today that you set your ambition. I pray
[1:47:10] that you you say, "Well, Wayne, I I I've
[1:47:12] got low ambitions." I pray right now
[1:47:14] that you set them.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And Paul said to set your affection.
[1:47:18] That means it's adjustable. Brother
[1:47:20] Matt, you you can adjust it.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; There's adjustments.
[1:47:25] It can be adjusted.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; You can set it.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; He He knew what I was talking about. Set
[1:47:31] triggers, you know. You can adjust him.
[1:47:33] It's adjustable.
[1:47:35] You can get your goal. If you want a
[1:47:37] pound, two pound, three pound, it's
[1:47:38] adjustable.
[1:47:40] He said, "Set your affection." It is
[1:47:43] completely a choice.
[1:47:45] Yes,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; it's a choice of what you're going to
[1:47:47] look at, how you're going to feel about
[1:47:48] it. You're standing there and 10 spies
[1:47:51] said, "There's giants."
[1:47:54] And Joshua and Caleb said, "We're more
[1:47:56] than able
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; looking at the same promise, looking at
[1:48:00] the same opposition,
[1:48:03] but there was two different confessions
[1:48:04] because it was two different attitudes.
[1:48:07] I want the attitude this morning. We can
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; we can We're more than able for this. We
[1:48:14] can conquer this.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; We can defeat it. Not just for a
[1:48:17] service, not just for a week,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; but there could be a complete victory in
[1:48:21] your life today
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; because faith
[1:48:25] is what gives you the victory over the
[1:48:28] world. Could you stand to your feet with
[1:48:29] me this morning?
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:34] Amen.
[1:48:37] Lord, I lift
[1:48:39] your name.
[1:48:43] Your holy
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:47] name.
[1:48:49] Jehovah
[1:48:53] God.
[1:48:55] Elohim.

[1:50:40] Yet for me
[1:50:42] your love is still
[1:50:46] the same.
[1:50:50] [Music]
[1:50:53] Lord, I bend my knee
[1:51:00] and all in fear of thee.
