right places and Lord as we come together tonight as a children we come to worship you and Lord truly we do not come to the unknown God lord though you're unseen you have so revealed yourself in this age than that we can see you by your promise Lord and we're so thankful Lord tonight that we have been invited into this realm that we could understand now we ask you to come and touch the hearts Lord bless your children send your anointing Upon Us father for Thy word oh God we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things amen am and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we'd like to go into the book of Ephesians I'd go in Ephesians chapter 2 and I'd like to read from the 11 the verse down to the 18th verse um I'm taking a little bigger bite on these scriptures uh some of these I'm taking a long time in maybe one section and then I'm adding because the way Paul writes this some of these scriptures are saying the same thing again and again just a little different way so U I want to include uh these few verses together amen 11 down to 18 wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcised uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at the time you were without Christ being aliens from the common wealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of his promise having no hope without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes or far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity when the even the law the Commandments contained in the ordinances for to make himself Twain one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God and one body by the cross having slain the enity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were a far off and to them that were n for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated tonight I want to take that and for a context I'd like to speak to you on chosen to approach God chosen to approach God as we read this here in the book of Ephesians it's an it's an amazing thing of how Paul in Ephesians chapter 2 has began aen with you who were quickened and then he speaks of God rich in Mercy and he tells you that ye that were dead and sins and trespasses and now he's remembering and reminding you amen that there was a time that you were without Christ now who he's speaking to is Ephesians he's speaking to this Ephesian church people that are in Christ and he's trying to Clare to them what kind of real change has happened in their life what what what Christ has done for them they're experiencing uh they're they're already in it now he's talking to them about what's been done for them and he he says here that remember now ye and times past Gentiles In the Flesh so he's making sure you understand he's speaking to them that were outside the Covenant as Gentiles who were called uncircumcision by them which were circumcised amen and that the time that you were without Christ see not only were we not Christians now it's this is a this is amazing Paul speaking this to these people because he's living in a time that is just when the Gentile church is coming in that when the gentile people are just being received into the into the promises of God and not only we were not Christians but we had no knowledge of Christ or the Messiah see there was no title to the blessings that was would proceed from him so he's speaking to people who are now under the blessing from Ephesians 1 they've been seated in Heavenly places and now he's telling them you were quickened who were even dead in sin and he's saying there was a time that you were without Christ but here's a little deeper meaning than this they wasn't even expecting Christ there was not even a Prophecy of the Messiah to come to them and that's you remember when brother bandam talks about the woman at the well and he said Jesus went to the woman of the well and he performed the sign of the Messiah he said then he went again to Phillip and The Sign of the Messiah and he went to Peter and the son of Messiah and he said see he done it for both the Jew and the Samaritan because they were expecting a messiah he said but these gentile people had never had any promise of a messiah so they were not just without Christ they were without expectation of Christ they had no they had not even an expectation that Christ would come to them and they had no idle to the blessing they had no right to the blessings of God because Paul is making it known to you that you were aliens from the common wealth of Israel and you were by birth think of this idolatrous by your birth amen as a gentile amen not only were you not apart you were away from Christ without a promise of Christ without uh uh that even it was supposed to come to the Gentile race and then he says to them and then you didn't have any privilege in the the Jewish and the Jewish Nations now think of this because that they were strangers to the covenants of Israel when Paul calls them strangers and he's calling them aliens it's a very significant thing because of the Old Testament rules that he was calling them strangers having no part in the promises of God so they were not even in the Covenant at all they wern't considered in the Covenant because the Covenant that Paul was introducing to them was strictly made to the abrahamic seed that was who the promise was made it was not made to everyone it was made to Abraham and his seed after them and these Gentiles in this Ephesian church had no no rights at all under the abrahamic Covenant there was nothing there for them amen and it was so much in that they wasn't the seed they had no part of the covenants they had no part of what God done on the horb for the Israelites they had no part in the token or the Passover they knew nothing of the seven blessings of God through through the uh through the great feast they they didn't know any of these promises they wasn't blessed any one of these Amen in so far that Paul begins to say to them that they were without hope now if that wording ever would describe anybody it would describe you and I tonight that we were without hope Amen in other words that there was there was no hope and you say well brother Wayne without hope what does that mean it means there was no hope of a pardon of sin amen now there was no hope of this there was no hope of the Resurrection there was no hope of the blessings there was no hope of the covenants there was no hope listen what Paul is telling this Ephesian church is you were so far removed from God not just without God but you were strangers to God you were aliens to God you had no hope with God he's trying to make you understand that that what God has done for you is above your understanding in it's it's above what you could even desire or even think to desire because it was only God look what we was without hope look and it says without God in this world Amen without God in this world I I think that's that's powerful because as a gentile amen if you've ever traveled he was just down South America you ever traveled in the foreign countries you'll find there's a lot of and now it's coming back to America but there's a lot of gods in the Gentiles there's a lot of gods you go into the Pagan country countries and you can go over into the Asian countries and you find their buddh and you find all different types of Asian uh you can go into India you find the Hindu religions now and I will say something to you amen if you've never been there you you might not recognize it but many of the of the west of the Eastern religions of that Hinduism and things have crept their way into this America amen when the Eastern Indians start coming here lots of them are here now as doctors and and they're they here as a hotels and you know the hotels on all the hotels you know amen and and and you know all your gas stations and I love the Indian people I'm not trying to be amen matter of fact someone's probably watching right now but but but you find out that and they amen that's real strong amen but you'll find out that some of the things that are happening in America now actually has its roots in that Hindu religion amen with the burning of incense and things that's all from there all these you see these nose rings and you see these belly rings and you see all these different little tattoos and things that's all coming from the Hindu religion and it's moving right over into this world Amen look what's happening this Leia is going right back where it was before God got him out of this godforsaken world this America is returning right back to its paganism amen that God brought it out of to begin with see we were without hope without God Amen that's the worst state anybody could be in no hope and no God we were lost in this world Amen and but it was God who was rich in Mercy amen that reached out to you and I amen it's not that we didn't have Gods but we didn't know Elohim we didn't have we didn't have the self-existent god the only thing we could worship was agnostics or un unknown God can I say many people are practically atheists they say they're not but practically they're atheist in their practices in their life that's this what this lean is did brother manman said in the thinking man's filter he said when we come into this world you were born in sin and you didn't even come with a fighting chance that that's just good to he'll Bly preaching right there but you didn't have a Fighting Chance you know what that means it means you walked into the fight and you was whipped before you threw the punch you didn't have a fighting chance when you were born in this world you didn't have a fighting chance but God put something in you that made you desire God when you without hope you without God you were lost in darkness but something in you said there's a God somewhere and I got to find him I got to know where he's at you never desired God but God desired you there was something in you you went to this church and that church and somewhere else but you didn't even have a chance amen because you were lost in this world but God Amen gave you Mercy that you might be able to find it because what the what the prophet is saying here amen I I think Paul is saying so powerfully amen without God in this world he said but now in Christ ye that were sometimes a far off were made nigh by the blood but ye that were far off how far off was I brother Wayne ye that were far off how far was you how far off was you without God lost in this world without hope as a commonwealth alien to the promises of God that's best way I know to say it that's how far you you were you were that far away amen and and and when you think about this you watch uh in in the prophet speaks of this in Acts chapter 2 from Exposition in church ages and he says uh as as they came to Peter and they said men and Brethren what can we do to be saved and Peter said unto them repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promis is unto you and unto your children and to all that are a far off even to as many as the Lord Our God shall call now isn't it powerful brother Ram says here it is and unto you Jews and unto your children Jews and to them that are a far off Gentiles and as many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and Gentile and as long as God is calling the Pentecostal message of power will never cease amen the Pentecost a message of power will never cease until God keeps quits calling but he has called us who are a far off amen the gentile people were a far off Our Roots were a far off our minds were a far off but God who was rich in Mercy called us Unto the Sons of adoption to give us the spirit of adoption and the Pentecostal blessing still exists for every man woman or child that God would call I don't care how far off they are if God's calling them he has a Pentecostal blessing that is left for them which is the only Vindication of the Resurrection that there is amen it is a Pentecostal blessing and the power of it will never cease it is the inalienable right to every believer that comes to God to receive the Holy Ghost I don't believe we are to take it away from our children I don't I don't believe it when this leosia has turned back into an Old Testament leysa brother said the Old Testament had Church ages and it ended with Le oysa and we find that this world is back in the same stage it was under the physical laws and the Sadducees and the traditions and the ideas and the Darkness of man and look how far away we were but God who rich in Mercy came to our lives amen and gave us a Pentecostal blessing my goodness isn't that powerful amen it's it's it's a powerful thing when he shows you how far off you were Paul's speaking to him now and said but you made nigh by Christ for he is our peace put it Ephesians chapter 2 and 14 up there for he is our peace who hath made both one hath broken down the middle wall of petition between us for he is our peace that he there is Christ yes sir the Lord Jesus Christ is our peace that word peace there is actually Shalom he is our Shalom he is our rest he is our mourning he is our peace he is our life he is our hope he is the rising of the sun he is the dawning of the day star Christ is our peace amen and I think it's powerful because the scripture tells us this in Isaiah 57 let's read three verses 19 20 and 21 for I create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the Lord I will heal him but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose Waters cast up M and dirt there is no peace saith my God to the wicked there is no peace saith my God to the wicked do you know that's who you were when Isaiah was writing this scripture there is no peace to the wicked he's talking about the Gentile he's talking about the Heathen who had no sacrifice they had no blood covering they had no access to God they had no job that was they had no offering they had no peace they had no Grace they were the wicked outside the covenants of God brother said that's why God sent Jonah down to the Gentiles because they had no blood offerings they had no sin offerings they had nothing to offer to God they were lost and they were Wicked and there was no peace in the wicked do you know that doesn't change tonight without Christ there is no peace without Christ in a home there's no peace in a home without Christ in a church there's no peace in a church without Christ in a heart there's no peace in an individual that's the reason many homes are intermo and many churches are in turmo because the people in the home and the people in the church have never come to a peaceful experience with their maker almighty god listen I I I I I know this right now that Jesus him s the Bible predicted is the prince of all peace and mcedc is the king of all peace and the Millennium will be a place where peace is going to rule but if we could find the peace that passeth understanding under the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we can have a millennium right here on Earth we can live in peace with man we can live in peace with hearts because Jesus is our peace he is our peace he speaks it in the Book of John and he said I give unto you peace not like the world gives you but the peace I give unto you I will not leave you comfortless Restless unsettled but I'll send the comforter unto you and he shall comfort you see in a time of anxiety wasn't it what what did God do for Rahab am me that Gentile woman he gave her a token and that token was her peace in the time of trouble it was her peace when she looked around she was a wicked woman under a covenant of peace because the token represented the forecasting of the blood of Jesus Christ it was a comfort to her oh my amen the the peace of God Jesus is our peace you see the age we're living in amen it's the most neurotic of all ages that's ever been it's it's more neurotic than it's ever been uh I I I I I I'll say something uh let let me just read this here the church age book now now brother Bram says it like this he said God says to this loud to see an age it's wretched the Greek word comes from enduring trial yet it has nothing to do with trials that come from a Christian to a Christian for God describes a Christian's trial as blessed and his altitude one of Joy whereas the description is phrased wretched and miserable loud to see as wretched and miserable and he says see in this age of abundance How can there be this many trials well now it's strange but in the age of Plenty an opportunity and everyone has so much and there's so much to be had when all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night and pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors and entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boast of tremendous stores of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever the age boast of spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever the age boast of moral values and more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about knowledge and science but it is fighting a losing battle in all Fields the human mind and soul spirit cannot comprehend or keep a breast with the changes that have come upon this Earth in one generation we've gone all the way from a horse and buggy to a space age and we are proud and boastful about it but inside is a Dark Void Cavern that is crying out in torment without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that the age that we'll be called the age of neurotics it boast but it cannot back it up it cries peace but there is no peace it cries at a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my God to the wicked now now the prophet has just draw out something he's draw out an age of increase without God because God has been put on the outside of the church Christ who is our peace is knocking trying to get in but he's been set outside the church amen now I I maybe want to revisit something just for a moment I know sometimes I get a bad rap people think well you're real hard on this uh this uh what they call it psychology amen now now the reason being is because psychology can't answer to a soul it can't answer to a soul it's it's it's not that I'm again studying or I'm again somebody trying to better themselves or somebody trying to climb the ladder with with some understanding I I I think people perish without knowledge but but you got to see that God is the only satisfier of that Soul it's the only answer to that Soul see you'd be better off without anything and an experience with God than all the books in the world and no experience with God you see it's only God can satisfy that now I said that the other it's pretty funny because I get people upset at me thinking I'm fussing at some preacher somewhere but I will say this guys I've been preaching against psychology for 20 years and if some preacher comes in your mind when I say psychology shame on that preacher because you never think of me as a psychologist because I do not defend psychology now it's funny is cuz sometimes even people get upset at me because then I'll say something like well in medical science if you need to see a psychologist go see one and then somebody will get upset and say well brother Wayne B and psychology well see then I'm SE when you got both sides mad at you you're in a good place you're in a good place does that means you've chosen middle ground that means look if you got a break broke arm go see a doctor folks if you got a clogged artery go see a doctor amen if your arm was broke You' go see one if you got a broken something on the encycle see one and somebody without God the best help they can get is is some help maybe a doctor somewhere or something look if somebody's about to take their life would you rather them take their life or sit down and talk to a doctor see they don't have any hope I'm for anything that helps somebody I I'm not promoting psychology here and somebody gets a little upset at me come talk to me about it and I'll tell you I'm not promoting psychology but I but I do promote anything that helps somebody and if they ain't going to get help with God God God God bless these people that try to help somebody amen and and and try to get them through this life amen but I'll say this amen the only hope for this nation is God the only hope for a church is God the only hope for a life is God the only way you'll overcome that anxiety is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost let the power of God come down and burn it out of your life let God come and take that nervousness out of you listen you don't have to live your life conquered by a nervous Spirit or by depression or by a devil amen there's a God here there's a God here in the midst of the church that can burn that devil right out of your life that's right it's a devil don't pet it around and say it's a complex or it's a little feeling you got it's a devil it's a fallen spirit and it's Come From Hell to destroy your marriage to destroy your life to destroy your peace amen but I once was without God but not tonight I once was without hope but not tonight tonight we have receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the [Applause] Hope amen which is the hope of life in Isaiah 9 he prophesied and said unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful I love how brother bam says it he run out of things so he just said wonderful right amen the counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen yeah in Genesis 49 Moses prophesies and said the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shallow come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be y'all know that second Thessalonians 2 when Paul says the Gathering shall be unto him he says and then he turns around said there'll come a great Fallen away in the last days that day cannot come until there's a falling away a falling away from what from him right and and and Moses is prophesying of Jesus when he says a lawgiver shall come between his feet and Shadow come that word Shadow actually means peacegiver when the Peacekeeper comes when the Great Master of Peace steps upon the scene that's when it's going to be when shaloh means Peacemaker the Prince of Peace himself is being prophesied of course he was the son of David and Solomon himself fell under that rain when Solomon built his Temple and for 900 years offered peace upon the Earth brother B said they had their Millennium right there amen because they gathered around the gift that God put among them amen can you imagine what this nation would be tonight had they gathered around the gift that God had put in this age brother said what gift is it he said it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the gift that God has sent into this age and we've seen it magnified in the ministry of William brandom amen that it wasn't just a tradition it was an emotion it wasn't ideas it was the person himself for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice and where the Lord is there is Liberty because he's the spirit of Liberty he's the spirit of peace he's the spirit of hope he's the spirit of life in Isaiah 53 when Isaiah prophesied of him he said surely Heath borne our grease and carried our sorrows and we did seem him spitten and stricken and Afflicted but he was wounded for our treas transgressions oh God he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed my going to take a cry and fit for just a little bit yes sir thank you Lord the chastisement of my peace was upon him in other words he took the beating for you to have peace he took the weapon for you to have peace he held his peace and took the beating in his flesh that you could sit here tonight and say to that old Dreadful devil get away from me in the name of Jesus I've got peace tonight I got peace and it's like a river and it's flowing out of my soul it don't matter what's happening in this world around me peace lives on the inside of me because Jesus is the king of peace and he conquered my soul Hallelujah the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed we like sheep have gone astray and turned everyone his own way and the Lord had laid upon him the iniquity of us allall he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth brother right that that that's a conqueror that's a real one right there he never defended himself folks he opened not his mouth he didn't say one word in one word he could have brought 12 Legions of angels but as a lamb he was led to the slaughter and as a sheep before shears Dums he opened not his mouth he was taken from the prison and from judgment for who shall declare his generation for he was cut out of the land of the living brother said he want to have a wife he had desires like a man to have a wife and a family and have children but he was cut off from the land of the living he gave his life a 33 year old man he didn't take a wife he didn't take a child he didn't give to anybody any bit of his own body amen but he knew there was another generation coming he knew there was a seed a super seed that was going to come out of him and that seed would be air to every promise that had been given no matter the flesh amen no matter the body you were born in no matter the situation God was going to come through and give mercy and decare generation amen what what was he saying yet it pleased the brw Lord to bruise him and Heth put to him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin see he became our peace he came to destroy the enmity that was between you and God watch this in Colossians chapter 1 same writer Apostle Paul and having made peace through the blood of his cross you said preacher how was he the peace I'll tell you how he did it he made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things if you're a studier you'll find out there's actually a peace offering in the Old Testament they had all kinds of offerings and one of them was a peace offering and it was a blood offering that they took and offered to God and they waved before the Lord and the comer the sacrificer ate of it and also the priest ate of it showing they both partook of the sacrifice and having made Beast through the blood of his cross by him reconciled all things unto himself I say whether they be things in the Earth or things in heaven and you come on somebody who was that you and you and we that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now have reconciled you who are wicked in your works you that were Wicked in your mind God help baptize our mind and we don't think the wicked things but God who is rich rich in Mercy look what he come he come to bring back the alienated he come to restore us that were enemies to God to our only hope we were an enemy to him to our only help we were an enemy we was an enemy to God to the Redeemer we were his enemy to our blessed lover we were his enemy but through the blood of the Cross he has reconciled us don't you ever ever put this blood under your foot as it's just something that you can take or leave the blood come on church it's not the chemical tonight the blood is the spirit that's been released in the church and through the spirit we have access to God tonight through the peace offering of the [Music] blood well I feel like it I thank God I'm not his enemy tonight he made peace through the blood of the Cross and look what he said in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight Lord why didn't he die why didn't he give his life why it wasn't in vain but he took enemies and made them n to God he took people that couldn't approach God and gave you an approach an angel couldn't even take according to Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 14 Heath broken down the middle wall now some people believes this was just the wall that was in the courts that separated the Jew and the Israelite but it's deeper than that friends he had broken down the middle wall of partition because there was laws in the Bible there was laws in Abraham's Covenant that prevented you enemies from coming in the presence of God can you imagine the Bible that you carry under your arm forbade you to go in the presence it forbade you to offer a sacrifice it forbade you to bring blood into the sanctuary it forbade you to put incense before God the writings of the Bible forbade you not only were you away from God you were forbidden by the word to go in I got it laying right here in front of me no stranger was allowed to burn incense in the presence of God God rebuked Israel for allowing aliens to come in and make sacrifices before the Lord we had no rights inside there but through his flesh yes Lord through his flesh brother Bram says it all he said see even in that day he said the regular congregation couldn't even go in under the blood they could go they could go and live under the blood but they couldn't go in the shukan of Glory even the regular Congregation of Israel couldn't do it but when the blood of Christ came the True Blood it let man get in the presence of the shik glory now we see this in Matthew 27 when Jesus dies from the cross what you're seeing is you're seeing God's Veil he was God manifested In the Flesh in Hebrews 1 he manifest or expressed him expressed him no man seen God at any time except in him the only begotten go son the image of the invisible God yes sir and he was hanging in plain view but they thought he was behind that temple veil but the Bible said in his resurrection amen or when when he when he cried out it finished I believe at the exact timing he screamed with a loud voice and the Rocks began to rent and the temple veil was rent from the top to the bottom always wondered why in the world from the top to the bottom but it was because what was it 40 foot up there I think they said I think it's off top of my head but I think it's around 40 foot don't Mark me on that but it was it was high enough a man couldn't reach it but brother BR said it started at the top and came down to prove to you who did it a man didn't stand on the earth and rip it up but God brought a hand from heaven and ripped it down because God was bringing his presence in the face of mankind and there they saw there they saw the plain view of the temple rail being rent and The Mercy Seat was no longer behind the veil it was hanging there peace was not in in that sacrifice any longer peace was in that Veil peace was there hanging on the cross the chastisement of our peace was a there is no other peace there is no other hope there is no other access there is no other life his life comes from Jesus Christ and Jesus Alone brother mam says it very clearly amen that he rent The Veil now that's coming to the that's come to the end time Le oosa we don't have a natural Veil now holding back we have ecclesiastical veils and brother Brandon says those ecclesiastical veils had veiled God off from the people amen isn't that something amen God and all that we know brother Bram said how about people that are veiled from the presence of God somebody preaches Church tradition oh my Mercy which adds and takes from them and everything by injecting their own subjects and their own thoughts and not the word of God what kind of veil is it it's got an ecclesiastical Veil but God has tore that Veil wide open Hallelujah they said there's no such thing as prophets brother I'll tell you what God tore that Veil into and we saw that Jesus is the prophet that Moses said amen in Deuteronomy the 18th for the Lord I God shall raise a prophet like an unto me in Acts the third chapter Peter refreshes the presence of God and said the heavens must receive Jesus until the restitution of all things amen and we shall receive a prophet like an unto Moses and how are we going to get Jesus on the earth and his body in heaven unless he brings a vessel a redeemed vessel upon the Earth to magnify that Jesus is still a prophet he is the same yesterday today and forever the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy he is the prophet of all prophets he amen he was a prophet of he was a god prophet he never changed he's still as much Prophet tonight as he ever was prophet hallelujah amen and tonight we know that because we're not looking at the veil of some tradition that says God don't have prophets anymore isn't it something amen how they quote to you the the the religions of the world will say to you they'll say well the law and the prophets were until John but for some reason they don't read the rest of the Bible the very next word it says it says and but after that the kingdom of God it was not the end of prophets it was the end of Law and Prophets as the government of God but on Mount Transfiguration we heard a voice come from heaven and in the law and the prophets amen Moses and Elijah was standing there and God said this is my beloved Son hear ye him and God adopted Jesus Christ as the only source of Hope the only source of Life the only source of Salvation if you need something from God you got to go to Jesus come on friend Peter said Lord to whom would we go come on now but if somebody told you Jesus ain't a prophet then you could see a prophet sign and they'll say that's some heretic or that's some some idea or that's some man-made religion oh but what a lie the devil told we have seen a a sign in this age in ought to restore peace back to the soul you ought to know Jesus is Alive you see why there's no peace cuz people don't know if he's alive go ahead they they got a tradition but it ain't pacifying them they got a church book but it ain't taking care of the Soul oh but here come here come a prophet of God manifesting God so real that we know there's prophets yes sir brother said there's no such thing in the last days Apostles and prophets there is no such thing as Divine Healing there's no such thing as sear anymore there's no such thing as Mark 16 being F fulfilled the apostolic ages already done they veiled it from the people but God walked right out with the Holy Spirit of fire and rent the thing from the top to the bottom hlu he tore it all open yes sir and even though Arkansas hillbilly can look tonight and see that he's still God come on church it's not in your training it's in your experience with God you can train people but to they experience God for themselves you know David you know David had something different than his Brethren they were all Israelites but when David come up there he had seen the experience of the God that he was serving and he said I know he can kill a lion and I know he can kill a bear and who is this uncircumcised Philistine that would stand in the presence of God if a man has ever had an experience with God you'll never sell him a beta Goods of some education or some theology because he knows God is real listen I tell you something tonight young people I want you to hear me loud and clear there is a God that can answer your heart if you want an experience with God there's a God that can answer it you don't quit knocking you don't quit seeking you don't quit coming you come to God because he has an answer for your heart if you got a need he's a God that can answer it we don't have to shake your hand to satisfy your soul I don't have to tell you every night you're saved when you don't believe it in your heart there's a God that can dissolve the doubts of your heart and let you know without a doubt that God has come into your soul and [Applause] [Music] [Applause] believed I think we're hungry for an absolute I think we're hungry to know that God does these kinds of things in our day it's a reality folks you don't have to pack up and go home and say well I don't know if God still does it yes he still does it absolutely he still does it and I don't know if he'll do it tonight or if he'll do it tomorrow or he'll do it the next day but one thing I know is he's that kind of God that'll do it when you don't expect it yeah in a way you don't expect it that's right amen praise the Lord in numbers 16 and 40 it said We Were Strangers he wasn't allowed to come in if you like to search at Ezekiel 44: 5-9 said you wasn't allowed in but in Colossians 2:14 Paul answers it he said the blotting out of the handwriting the ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us he took it out of the way by nailing it to the Cross brother that's one way to do away with it it was his own law right Jesus did not come to do away with the law he came to fulfill amen that's right he fulfilled it in the cross I wish I was a preacher do a good Hallelujah come on it was in that cross yeah amen he say preacher where your peace it's in that cross where your forgiveness it's in that cross amen how you going to make it it's in that cross amen I don't claim any anything else I don't claim my abilities I don't claim any good thing I've done or any good work I pray there's some stacked up for some reward somewhere I don't know but when it comes to my salvation when it comes to my peace when it comes to me coming before God I don't bring anything but I say Lord it was the [Applause] cross it's in the cross having watch that 15th verse having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinances I got to I got to read this y'all read this what let's watch this having abolished in his flesh the enity right even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinances for to make it in himself of Twain one new man so making peace Hallelujah I didn't do it he did I didn't make a way he did I didn't save myself he did it he gave me the grace he gave me the blood he gave me the life all I've done is said Lord I accept your grace and your mercy and what you have done and I recognize plainly where it stands tonight he abolished it and he slain the enity thereof watch Paul in Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ my goodness by whom also we have access we have access by faith into his grace where we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God Ephesians 2:18 the last one we read there for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father we have an approach that's right to God see it's through him in Ephesians 3:12 that we have boldness and access and confidence in him and John 10:7 Jesus announces I am the door to the Sheepfold he's the only way in in John 14 and6 he said I am the way the truth and the life amen an old boy one time I was in a in a little little uh uh a little hole wall back here in Arkansas we ate we ate a lot there my wife never went with me much she a little bit dirtier than she wanted to eat out you know never bothered me eggs were good you know coffee was good that's all I care about you know a bunch of old boys we gather up there one day old boy com in there and he'd been serving he' been in a Pentecostal church a little bit and we were it was kind of one of them Community things everybody sitting we like you sitting in the same room you know and they all knew I was a preacher so one of them said something to me and he said he he's a backslid boy backslid Pentecostal boy he said well preacher he said which one of you guys got the truth anyhow I said well it ain't our church I said it ain't your church either yeah amen he said well who's got the truth I said Jesus said he was the truth and any man that's got Jesus has got truth come on you can't claim truth for yourself you can't say I got the truth that a truth might have you but it would be pretty arrogant of you to imagine that you got everything God's Got In Truth come on church but but God is truth Jesus is truth and what I don't know about him I got him Hallelujah I might not know all the answers but I got him inside me truth lives inside me H we're not starting no denomination we're not starting our forign no more I say any man that comes to Jesus has come to truth and he is the way the truth and the life and no man come unto him John 6:44 is one brother R's favorite scriptures no man come to me except the Father which sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last day now here's brother random scripture on this an approach or an access to God look in Psalm 65 and vers vers four for blessed is the man who whom thou choosest and causeth to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts and we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thine house even of thine Holy Temple now blessed is a man whom thou chooseth and causeth to approach unto him now brother preaches a message if you want to do some homework tomorrow it's called approach to God he uses this scripture as powerful blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach in the church age book brother bam uses this he said see they were not a true church but a false Church they were the synagogue of Satan you know the scripture the synagogue of Satan now the word synagogue is not the same word used for church in the Bible which means called out ones it means the summoned ones he said or the summonsed ones he said the psalmist said about these elect people blessed is the man whom thou choosest and who thou cuse to approach unto thee that theyou might dwell in thy courts but the meaning of synagogue is simply as assembling or gathering now this can be good or bad now in this case it is bad for they are those which are assembling is not of God but of themselves see Isaiah said they shall they shall surely gather together but not by me right now look what he's saying blessed is a man whom I choose and cause to come to me right now I just preached on the brooding logos on Eagles Wings he bore them right brother B said what was those Eagles Wings it was Moses's Vindicated message and they were following Moses and while they were following Moses they went through the Red Sea and people trying to impersonate them drowned in the sea right but brother man said but Moses got oversea the children Israel got over because they were bore on Eagle wings now there are Gatherings that are not caused by God you see he says there's churches in the Bible was telling synagogues there are places that are gathering even religious gatherings but it's not caused by God if you want to get real strong in it brother bam says they'll worship the devil and don't even know they're doing it sir right now now how far off see listen they worship God in vain by Tradition now watch what what's what I'm talking about here in Matthew 24 it says that they will deceive the very elect if it were possible brother said watch that word election Jesus brings it up there will be an elect seed in the last days so there is a gathering under Satan and y'all know brother BR talks about it he gathers them he said but God will gather a people by vindicating his word amen yeah amen blessed is he that God chooseth and causes to come to him do you know there was a million people tonight you got saved now what was it that struck your heart about the message amen of the hour what is it that caused you amen to come into the presence of God see something is giving you access something is giving you access now I got one more scripture here in closing in Psalms 24 David says this for the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof amen the world and they that dwell therein for Heath founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the floods who shall Ascend into the hill of our Lord and who shall stand in the Holy place he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who ha not lifted up his soul into vanity nor swore deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and the righteousness from the god of our Salvation this is the generation of them that seek him they seek thy face oh Jacob blessed are they with a pure heart for they shall see God see friends God has chose us tonight to come into His presence can the musicians come he has chosen blessed is he that chooseth and causeth Moses was okay 40 years family sheep he was doing good his way from Egypt but God caused him to turn to see that Vindication in that Pillar of Fire and he reminded him of the promises and then he went down into the power of God because God chose him and caused him right do you see tonight there's an approach we got an approach to God yeah brother B said when job didn't have a Bible he had revelation and that Revelation caused him to have the right approach and even when he was when his children was in trouble he had an approach to God when problems came he had an approach to God listen we have a high priest tonight that can be touched we can approach him I was just reading today a little bit and I was just thinking about world leaders I was thinking about the pope you know he's he's so known actually we were talking about Rome when we were in Europe and I got to think about meeting the pop you know but you know all the things you got to do to approach that guy well I'll never meet him I'll never meet him because you got to kiss his ring right I ain't kissing no man's ring nor am I kneeling any man's feet right exactly so I'll never meet that man because I can't do what it takes good to approach that man do you know they say that you can't even approach him unless he as to see you if he's walking through a crowd and you approach him it's so far out of eut but he's got to ask to you know to come here and then when he comes you got to kiss his ring and kneel and there's this big big Todo thing and he's just an Earthly man the king of all Kings has made an approached by his blood and access through his Spirit tonight Hallelujah that we who were strangers aliens without God because he took the ordinances of his approach that was against you coming and he nailed him on the cross Hallelujah and he said now come unto me all you weak and heavy lad I'll give you rest you can approach me now he says hallelujah come approach me for your needs I'm a Healer amen I'm a deliverer I'm a savior come is't that powerful thank you Lord the one that can change everything in your life tonight has invited you to have an audience you can access him tonight would you stand to your feet
