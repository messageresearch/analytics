Daniel and we're going to be thank you brother we look into the Book of Daniel and we're going to look in the sixth chapter here and we want to look here in the 10th verse Daniel 6 and10 now when Daniel knew the writing was signed he went into the house and his window being open in the chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time amen God bless you you may be seated tonight I've been speaking a little bit from The Book of Daniel and I uh just felt to continue tonight if that's okay with you all there has been a few things that has been outstanding to me and uh to for me the Book of Daniel has always been an outstanding book and as long as I can remember uh these stories of the Hebrew children and of Daniel and the Lion's Den have been uh things that significantly stuck out in my memory even from a little child uh I I don't remember a lot about the doctrine uh when I was a little boy we grew up in church but till we was about 9 years old mostly what I remembered was Sunday school so we say God bless you Sunday school teachers uh thank you I do remember the men preaching from the platform and they got I remember them was they was pretty loud and some of them were sweaty and things but I remember one thing that was always significant to me as they talked about them uh Shadrach mesach and abedo and I never could pronounce them but I liked what God did for them and and it was amazing to me that God would let people get in a fire and he'd save them in the middle of the fire and then one of the other outstanding stories to me was the story of Daniel the Lion's Den I always thought that was amazing and then when I got a little older and I started reading it and I realized it wasn't Daniel on the Lion's Den it was Daniel and The Den of Lions it wasn't just a lion's den because a lion's den don't mean there's lions in it but he was in a Den of Lions I mean there was was lions in there and he was put in among live uh animals and and so tonight I just want to take a few minutes and to talk about the story of Daniel and uh and how that Daniel is showing a resolve uh to live for God and he's showing a resolve that he has purposed within his heart to not be defiled by Babylon to not be changed by their rules or by their laws but he has determined that he will remain true to God even to the taking of his own life now in Daniel the first chapter we read how that they uh the Bible said they had purposed in their heart and they wouldn't eat the king's meat they wouldn't defile themselves with the wine and then we found that God uh actually exalted them in the time of Nebuchadnezzar through the mystery and how that when the mystery was unfolded and then Daniel was able to discern the mystery which raised him above his Brethren and then we find of course then the Hebrew children uh denied to worship another God and they were thrown in the flames of fire and God delivered them and then we see that even through the years that seemed like Daniel almost began to get forgotten for a little while until in Daniel 5 when you see that the handwriting come on the wall and again David become or Daniel becomes a focus there in Babylon and they bring him out to be able to read the inscriptions and now this ability of Daniel to read the inscriptions on the wall is what's made him famous in the land of Babylon it's made him a famous man because he can understand and discern things that other people cannot understand his prophecies were exactly true the things that he said concerning the dream of Nebuchadnezzar and the things which he had said of elazar has just happened amen and he has just saw the changing of a government from Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar and Bel chazar Babylon is just changed under the meian Persians and they're now living under the rule of Darius the king of of the mes amen and this is about I think about a year before Sirius begins to rule as a Persian and you're and you're you're reading here of how that Daniel uh has been elevated in the Kingdom he has become third in rule can you imagine a Hebrew child who is captive who is not Babylonian not Persian not Meade he believes in one God and has been defiant in that belief and now he has been elevated to the third house highest power of the realm can you imagine now all the people and all the politics and all the working behind the scenes and all the people who were doing favors and petting one another on the back and secretly whispering but God was elevating this man and the Bible said he did it because he had an excellent spirit in him isn't it amazing how the spirit of a man will either promote him or demote him amen it was just we just read how be shazar was amen was killed that very night because that he had exalted himself in Pride just like his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar and we saw that he went into the Wilderness seven years what was a a great man was put to a low man because that his Spirit had become hoty and pridey but now we're reading about a man who is an humble man who is actually excellent in spirit and this man has been exalted to the third highest in the realm amen because of this now in Daniel chapter six we'll read just a little bit if it's okay the Bible said it Darius set over the kingdom 120 princes which should be over the whole Kingdom and over the three presidents of whom Daniel was first the princes might have accounts unto them and the King should have no damage then Daniel was preferred above the presidents and the princes because of an excellent Spirit within him see Daniel was preferred because he went around and he was really nice to everyone and and he and he done favors and he was political and he had this on that guy and he had this on that guy and he was twisting arms and Mak it a way for himself that's not what the Bible reads here amen uh uh brother bandam tells us something powerful he says God's gifts make room for themselves amen Daniel didn't have to go around there and work the sides and the quarters to find his position he didn't have to wrestle with anyone the King was exalted exting him because of the spirit that was found in him and look at this the scripture said an excellent Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the whole real this man is a whole lot like the man Joseph when you read the book of Genesis and there's about 13 chapters in The Book of Genesis that is given to the man Joseph and remember when God shows that Joseph is going to rule it was his own Brethren that become jealousy and out of jealousy see it was the core jealousy was the core of the problem they had with Joseph and there's a a tape if you like a a tape listener there's called Joseph meeting his Brethren and brother bam explains that it was their Brethren that Saul and Joseph the Covenant and it was the devil that got on them that had heard God prophesy from The Book of Genesis there in the garden when he said that uh the woman's seed he said shall have enmity with the Serpent's Seed and he shall bruise his head now when the scripture says that the devil went to looking for that seed for that very moment and the moment that Joseph be to get a vision of rulership Amen it was then his Brethren turned against him brother man said really what it was it was the devil trying to kill that seed out before it stomped him down see he was trying to get it while it was in Joseph but we see that Joseph was a son of prosperity I think it's a powerful thing tonight to understand Joseph was a son of prosperity and it did not matter what they did to Joseph he rose anyhow it didn't matter how critical it didn't matter the situation amen his own Brethren sold him into slavery amen they put him in a pit and he rose above he put in Piper's house and he became the chief in Piper's house they lied on him throw him in prison and the prison guards gave him rule over the whole prison amen from that place he was taken and put next to the throne of pharaoh himself so in Pharaoh's Egypt he was lifted amen it was not his political ability that was placing him there it was was the spirit that Joseph had amen it was the spirit of Christ it was an excellent spirit amen I I know that sounds Mighty abstract from where you're sitting here tonight but let me let me say something to you a prophet does us a favor and ties some scriptures together and he said you are all sons of prosperity amen if you're a child of God you are a child of prosperity the Bible said he that has been born of the spirit he is the Seed of Abraham according to the promises of ABR and according to Genesis the 12th chapter out of Abraham would come Kings is that right and so there are spiritual kings that are placed in the last day who are being exalted amen no matter the situation you were born no matter the problems of your life no matter the situations of the inheritance of of your uh uh physical abilities wherever you were placed you were still rising to the place that God calls you to be and listen amen I know that devil is going to do so many things against you there's going to be so many things thrown at you as a Believer amen but my Bible says in Romans the 8th chapter he says to amen that God will make everything turn out for your good all things work together for the good of them that are called of God according to his purpose amen do you believe that and if God before us who can be against us they in all things we are more more than conquerors in Christ amen who has led us are you hearing me tonight amen the devil can stack anything he wants to on the church but she's going to rise up anyhow it will only become a stepping stone for the Church of the Living God because we have been anointed to rise up in the age that we're living in Joseph is your type Daniel is your type amen God was exalting then the Bible said Heath highly exalted Jesus Christ is it is what the Bible said he highly exalted him amen do you know that you were positioned in Christ and wherever he is there is where the Church of the Living God is amen exalted and risen up in Christ Jesus now it's a powerful thing because you can see that the Lord Jesus of course is the picture here because Jesus amen was a perfect man with a perfect spirit and they crucified him him come on now he was crucified and they Bible says clearly they found no fault in him and Daniel is being is being persecuted but they can't find any fault so Daniel's fault is not the place of his persecution the persecution comes from the core of jealousy of people against people whom God blesses whenever God blesses you there will be a persecution against you whenever God blesses a church there will be a persecution against that church whenever God blesses you you let amen you let somebody get a blessing in the church and dance down the aisle amen there'll be a persecution spiritual natural amen every kind of situation because it's the devil's job to persecute the believer and he can't find nothing wrong with him he he that's an excellent Spirit the Bible judged and said that Jesus was a perfect man now Heen now the scriptures tells us here amen I I'll tell you the fourth verse is powerful then the presidents amen and then the presidents and the princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could not find no occasion or fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error of Faith found in him and then they said we shall not find any occasion against Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God so the only thing they could do to get it Daniel was to catch him serving his God now that he was guilty of now he was guilty of being a worshipper he was a guilty man of being someone who sought the face of the almighty he was guilty of prayer he was guilty of love he was guilty you see that's what he was guilty of was serving God amen I asked some people here while back I I I I I looked over in the scripture where Jesus said for what good do Works what good works do you Stone me for after all amen and I I wonder sometimes even with the prophet of the age what what good works are they stoning brother bandam for what what good thing that he did that they're mad about it in this age amen amen he done so many good things and seems like so many are upset about it amen but you see you can't really find any fault in him even his critics will say the man was ever wrong on his discernment even the critics will say not in all of the of the Ministries in the world have we ever seen more healings or more miracles amen than what we saw there so they can't find any fault in it so they they have to find the fault in the way that he serves God now notice this Heen those presidents and those princes assembled together the king and they said unto the king now Darius live forever and now they go to they go to using their politics here and they pump up the the king and the presidents of the Kingdom the governors and the prince and the counselors and all the captains have counseled together to make a fierce decree or firm decree and whosoever shall make a petition of any God or any man for 30 days say thee Old King he shall be cast into the Den of Lions isn't it amazing that they're going to make a law that makes the king a god under the people and nobody can seek a god unless they seek King darus now darus plays right into the hands of the political will they greased the wheel they stroke the ego they knew exactly what would get the attention of that King let's just build him up a little bit make him important and then he'll sway our Direction amen they knew human nature quite well now Old King established the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed and and add to the law of Moses the law of mes and the Persians which alterthe the king darus signed the writing and the decree now the law of Mees and Persians were a law that could not be changed that's a that's a direct that's a direct place here in the scripture you'll also find it in the Book of Esther amen that they couldn't change the law of the meet in the Persian now they made a law whether you couldn't pray for 30 days couldn't petition to any God now Daniel was a man who petitioned his God constantly three times a day amen and the Bible tells us that David was an UNC or Daniel was an uncompromising man I I think this is a Christian character I think there's a houseful of Daniels sitting here today amen there is an uncompromising spirit in him in other words amen he knew that they had made a law against praying they made a law against it and this man was so uncompromising that he even even denied the idea of shutting the curtains so nobody could see him praying but he literally went into his house as he had every other day and he draw back the curtains and knelt down and begin to pray now here's the thing Daniel knew Daniel knew that when he began to pray that he was going to contact God he knew that it was his communication to God Amen now I don't have time to preach tonight on prayer but I'll say this to you it's the most powerful weapon putting in the hands of a Believer amen there's a lot of times you can't do nothing about some of the situations there times where you can't counsel there's times when the situations just seem like there's no hope amen that's when you begin to pray and when the people of God begin to pray God makes a way where there is no way prayer will make a way for that to happen so when Daniel begins to pray he knows he's connecting with God but he's angering the mob against him he's actually breaking the laws of the land against him now I want you to think about this when they part those when they part those curtains and he turns to look out that window the Bible specifically says that he looks unto Jerusalem now there's a reason this man is praying with an open window toward Jerusalem is he's saying there's nothing going to hinder my prayer I'm not going to let a law I'm not going to let any kind of cloud nothing's going to hinder prayer and he turns to the window begins to pray now out that window somewhere far out there is the city of Jerusalem which is actually at that moment is in destruction and the temple of God is not even standing there but Daniel remembers the promise in the book of Kings when Solomon dedicated the Temple of the Lord he made a prayer un the temple and said Lord If thy people ever at any time get in trouble no matter where they are no matter if they've been cast out of thy sight Lord let them turn and look unto thy Temple and if they will look to thy Temple and pray that you will answer their prayer and deliver them now Daniel is a man that knew about the prayer of Solomon and that Temple wasn't there at that moment he could not see it with his eyes but he knew that that had been a promise from God that he would deliver a man who would look out that window and pray towards that Temple now I wonder how he was so sure have you ever read the Book of Jonah when Jonah was in the belly of a whale and he was in a place an Inc compromisable position he was between belly of a of a whale and he was in the bottom of an ocean it was impossible for Jonah to get out of the belly of that well but the Bible tells us that Jonah begin to give the vow of Thanksgiving and he began to pray in the belly what I've often wondered how did Jonah even know which way to look how did he know which way the East was amen we serve the kind of God that if a man determines to pray and he wants to pray right God will show him the right direction he will give him a help in the time of trouble and turning the right way that he would know how to pray my Bible says that God will give us utterance and the spirit will give us help that we might know how to pray amen Jonah found out amen that God delivers even when you're in the belly of a well Jonah found out that God is able to take a a man and deliver him out of any situation amen and here Daniel is praying the same kind of prayer he's not in the belly of a well but he's between a rock and a hard place he's between the law that says he cannot worship His God and a law that commands him to worship His God and he decided he would rather go into a den of lines than to go in the pits of hell he would rather walk into a den of lines than to face an Angry God he would rather face the penalties of man than whatever they could do to him in the human realm in other words he knew that I'm not going to fear a man who can destroy my body I fear a God who can destroy my soul his fear was not of the world his fear was of God the Bible said the beginning of all wisdom is the fear of God it's the fear that God would be disappointed with a man amen and see him differently amen when I think about this tonight I think about this Daniel that made this decision I don't have time to labor here on Daniel's Constitution we've we've labored a bit before but I will say this point he had an attit ude he would not give an inch of ground he had the attitude I'm not going to give an inch of ground and I think that there ought to be some Believers here tonight that would take that same attitude that we're not going to give an inch of ground we're not going to give anything back that God has given us we're we're not going to turn around or we're not going to say we're sorry Mr devil things are getting pressured around here and I think I'll run I I'll just pick up and run off somewhere and get out of the pressure no not this man he was not running from the pressure he was not running from the situation but he said I'm going to pray to God and I'm going to confront this devil and the God that I serve is the same God that Jonah served and he hears the Cry of the righteous and God is able to deliver whatever the situation is God was able to deliver this man was not running this man was not backing up this man was not hiding this man was making a public announcement I will serve God if I have to do it by myself this man was making a public announcement I'm going to preach the gospel if I got to preach it by myself amen I'm going to declare this message if I had to declare it by myself amen I told Brother Brian one time I said I'll tell you this I'd rather have a tambourine and a couple people out in a parking lot and worship God than to be in a house full with a morg and a bunch of dead amen people who don't want to worship God Amen I don't want nothing to do with a bunch of people that that has buried God somewhere and he's dead amen but I believe tonight we don't have to be out in the parking lot by ourselves God has filled your heart with the same desire that you will let this generation no amen I'll tell you this I wasn't put here just to fill up some space I wasn't put here in this age just to be a church member or just to be another person but God put me here to praise and worship in almighty God Amen and that's exactly what I'm going to do if I have to break the laws if I have to if I have to confront the walls of man I could say a lot there but I think we're getting the point amen I think it's I think it's the time that you make up your mind that you're not going to give up your worship you're not going to give up your praise Demons of depression and anxiety and criticism and oppression has told you it does no good to worship it does no good to pray it does no good amen there all these things you're saying that helps they don't help brother Wayne I tell you that's a ly devil amen and if you ever remember what it feels like to praise the Lord you can praise your way out of troubles you can praise your way out of problems you can praise your way out of depression there ain't nobody ever been depressed while they were worshiping God there's nobody ever had to take a nerve pill while the power of God was falling on them my goodness I believe we need to take a take a moment and remember amen that we're not here amen amen we're we're here to declare it openly declare it yes sir then these these men saw Daniel praying we saw him we saw him do it oh King the Bible says it like that that Daniel it's kind of like they say them people oh them people over there bling them people you know them Pentecostals well since when is that a bad name what kind of theology you got that made that a bad name brother BR said I am a Pentecostal have you ever listened to that tape brother brother brand preach called why I am a Holy Roller I don't stick that in your theology and get a way well I I am a Holy Roller can you imagine a prophet a Vindicated Prophet preaching a message like that what was he doing he was killing that Spirit he was destroying the idea that we were going to become a dignified social class of people but we're worshippers of the most high God and Apostle Paul said amen that the way you call heresy is the way that I worship the god of our fathers he was this this man amen was settled down on it and they said them people that Daniel he done broke the law now the Bible said amen that the king basically the King was was was uh he was with the King himself was in trouble because the king had already made a law that couldn't be broken look in the 16th verse then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and they cast him in the Lion's Den now I I think it's pretty amazing that they cast him in the Lion's Den but let's just let me just back up here just a little bit in the 13th verse and they answered and they said before the king the Daniel which is of the children of uh of the Captivity of Judah regardeth not their O King nor the decree that thou has signed but maketh his petition three times a day then the King when he had heard these words was sore displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him I don't know if you've ever studied this section but it's pretty powerful that the king of the country wanted to be Daniel's deliver but his law had already been spoken and he was not able to deliver now I want you to think about this here is a king that is able to cast him in a furnace but not able to deliver him and when the king had finally decided I am not able to deliver thee amen that's when he began to say to him then these men assembled un the king and he said unto the king king that the law the me and the Persians that no decree nor statute which the king established may be changed then the king commanded they brought Daniel and cast him in the den of lions and now the king spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee now here's a King telling him I can't deliver you but the god you serve he is a deliverer this is a this is a me telling Daniel I'm the king of this whole earth and I can't deliver you but your God he can deliver you amen and when he begins to say this amen the Bible said a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King sealed it with his own signate and the signat of the Lords and the purpose that it might not be changed concerning Daniel so they put put Daniel in the den of lions lions they put him in a Den of Lions Samuel and then they put a stone on the mouth of the cave to be sure that Daniel didn't come out of there they put the king's seal upon the stone to be sure nobody moved the stone and retrieved D Daniel out of there and the King went into his Palace and he passed the night fasting isn't it amazing he had a king in there who wouldn't even eat because he was in the he was in the and the King knew I can't help this man I can't deliver this man but I won't eat and I won't listen to any music amen and he wouldn't even sleep all the night long worried about Daniel that was in that Den of Lions amen so it was early in the morning I bet that King was waiting for the first crack of the Dawn and rode up out of the bed amen and early in the morning he went in haste unto the den of lions and when he had came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice and to Daniel and the King spake and said unto Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God is thy God whom thou service continually able to deliver you from the Lions I thought it was amazing he ain't looking for Daniel he's not opened it up yet but he knows if Daniel is alive he'll hear something come out of that Den he knows if Daniel is alive he will speak back concerning his God I thought it was pretty powerful I if I had some time right there I'd preach on them holies of holies if somebody's alive you'll hear some noise in there if somebody is still in there you'll hear the bells Amen brother manam said wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise I'm quoting a prophet he said listen he said if you're a religion he said if it ain't no noise in it he said it's dead and it needs buried amen but if there is a life in it there'll be a noise in it and it'll cry out holy holy holy but in the 21st verse of Daniel he says this then said Daniel unto the king oh King live forever for my God has sent his Angel and he has shut the lon's mouth and they have not heard me for as much as before his Ines was found in me and also before thee Oh King I have done no hurt now look at this amen he's telling him right then look God has come and shut the m of these Lions he shut them all up amen of course these mouth of lions is representing the mouth of the politicians who's trying to destroy this man amen and they and and since they couldn't do it themselves they gave him over to another Vice to be destroyed amen but nothing they could do to Daniel would destroy him nothing they could put on him would hurt him amen you said what's the secret of Daniel the Bible said he was an innocent man and there was nothing he had done but he had Cried unto his Lord my when I read this amen this is some shout material right here listen what he said he said listen now he said my God has sent his Angel oh King live forever my God has sent his Angel and he has delivered me he has shut the lion's mouth do you do you hear what he's saying he saying I cried to the Lord amen what you tried to keep me from doing up there in my house I did it down here in this dungeon I have defied the king both in my house and in the troubles but I have spoke unto one who can deliver me from the Lions and the Kings and the troubles amen that is all around me when I read this I thought my God sent his Angel unto Daniel Amen maybe you would say to me tonight amen what what happened in that what really happened over there in that Li's Den brother Wayne what was it took place brother bam says and what thank you of Christ he tells us he said when Daniel was through in there in that dungeon with those lons he said all of a sudden something moved and every fiber in my body he's he's telling this in first person with Daniel and he said every person every fiber in my body begin to move and I felt something tingling he said I begin to feel my face as it turns hot and chills went through me and I've seen with a lion's eyes we're all coming and the first thing you know they begin to turn their heads and walked away and when that feeling left me I looked and standing in the corner there stood one who is the Son of God he was standing there God had sent his angels to deliver me if you had Daniel up here tonight what he would tell you is that they threw me in the den of lions and when the and when the hot breath of the Lions was about to take me when the roar was taking my spirit and fear would have been settling upon me he said there was an Ang angel that come in the room you you yall know what that angel was brother R said it was a pillar of fire that come in the room of Daniel he said lions are scared of that Pillar of Fire that fire amen it it's amazing friend when you see that this angel that came into the Den of Lions was a pillar of fire when you you said brother Wayne how are you saying that scripturally well according to the Bible Amen in the book of Exodus it says that when the children of Israel were being delivered out of Egypt that God came to them and said my angel shall go before thee brother B said listen that angel of God he said that led the children of Israel he said it was a pillar of Fire by night and A Cloud by day and I believe he's still leading we know that it was the angel of the Covenant is that right it was the logos of Christ he still the same leading his people here on Earth today what was it that Pillar of Fire that came in that room was the angel of the Lord it was the angel of the Covenant it was Jesus Christ before he come into the flesh he was standing there in the room to tell them these Lions cannot touch you though a host would encamp about you God will shut the mouth of every Lon though thousands of demons Shall Gather around thee amen the spirit of God shall shut the mouth of the lion I thought isn't it something amen I I I get to I'm I'm that guy I get to thinking about these things and I think about that angel that Pillar of Fire that came in that room that Daniel would have seen that light as the Lions begin to move away and the light moved over in the corner and Daniel was able to lay down he was able to lay down the king couldn't sleep up there in the palace amen and Daniel laid down in a den of lions and went to sleep Daniel laid down his head and went to sleep sleep because the angel of the Lord was in the building with him the angel of the Lord was there to deliver him of his trouble he didn't need to sit up all night and fight with the Devils he was in the presence of the Mighty God he was in the presence of the great deliverer there was nothing could touch him there was nothing could harm him he was in the presence of almighty God Amen I tell you amen can you imagine when one of them big old Lions laid down and Daniel he snuggled up against one put his feet on the head of another and he laid his head as a pillow on another it would have been something close to like it was in the Garden of Eden when Adam would have called Leo over and they would have had a little fellowship and he would just pet him and he would have roared listen God can bring an eeden condition in the middle of the greatest troubles that has ever been our God can bring an atmosphere of the grace of God to any situation when the pillar of fire comes in things begin to change troubles begin to fade away problems begin to leave when it's the pillar of fire brother Ram said who was the it was the angel of the Covenant it was none other than Jesus Christ that led them in the in the wilderness when you when you read about this you you read about Daniel imagine he he had a good night sleep knowing that the Angels were there do you know that brother random told us amen that that was a secret with David amen do you if you if you look at the scripture amen it was a secret with these men that the angel of the Lord was with the children of Israel he wasn't with everyone but he was with the children of Israel when I when I I I look into this can I can I just take you uh to a place here in Exodus and and look in the seventh and the eth verse of the book of Exodus where brother Ram takes it he takes it from Exodus uh Exodus chapter 3 and he goes to the 6th to the e8th verse and brother Braham is talking about this angel in the time of Moses was in a bush burning with fire and the scripture says moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen thy Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard the Cry by the reason of the taskmasters whip for I Know Thy Sorrows watch what he said I have seen thy Affliction I have heard thy cry and I Know Thy Sorrows let me let me bring some comfort to you tonight God has seen your Affliction amen God has heard your cry he said and I Know Thy Sorrows now look what it says in the next verse in the eighth verse he says this and I am come down to deliver I think this is powerful church amen when the children of Israel were 400 years under the bondage and slavery of the Egyptian testmaster amen they had no hope of Deliverance they had no hopes amen but the angel of the Lord came down to Moses and said I have come down but it's for the purpose to deliver I have heard I have seen and I know what kind of situation it is oh think about this tonight when that angel come it come for the purpose to deliver when that angel will come in the days of Moses it was there to deliver people from a situation that was completely impossible for them to ever come out of but God who is rich in Mercy knew that that was his seed and he had promised to Deliverance to Abraham before they had ever got there and when that pillar of Light Came it was the angel of the Lord he had come for the purpose of Deliverance now listen he seen the afflictions he was there to deliver them of the afflictions to take them from it I I when you when you read the Bible I think the Bible is amazing how it's written because if you go over into Psalms the 34th chapter and you read the sixth and the seventh verse this is David writing it's a powerful section of scripture and David said for the poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles and the angel of the Lord look at that again he lays the Deliverance with the angel of the Lord he said the Lord heard him just like he did in the days of Moses he has heard him out of his troubles his afflictions and the angel of the Lord encampeth about them that fear Him and deliver them my goodness amen the angel of the Lord is camping about them that fear Him and deliver them you want to know how David slept at night when his enemy was all around him because he knew the angel of the Lord encamped about him you know how that there's a bride living in the middle of this age and yet they have comfort in their hearts amen how is it that our minds are not falling apart in the craziest times that ever been because the angel of the Lord encamps about them that fears him I want you to know tonight amen God Is Not A Million Miles Away but to them that fear the lord the angels of God are encamped about the church I know sometimes you can't see them with your natural eye but they're here all the same anyhow amen whether we're shouting or whether we're rejoicing or whether we're in troubles or whether there's cries coming from our heart God said the angels of the Lord would encamp about them that fear Him amen I I I know you've heard a lot of sermons on Angels but I just got to preach it to you tonight I happen to believe there's not an empty Pew in this building I believe there's not an empty seat I I believe there's not an empty space but I believe God has filled this building up tonight with angels and theophonic beings I believe Celestial beings are floating through this place Dynamic powers of light and Truth are flashing from every corner because the children of the most high God are here setting in the church tonight you said brother Wayne what are you talking about have you ever read your Bible the Throne of God have you ever read about what's around the throne there's angels and there's elders and there's worship come on church amen let me ask you where is the Throne of God tonight amen is not the Church of the Living God the heart of the church is the very Throne of God then God and his entire company is here in the church tonight wherever you go whatever you do there's an angel of the Lord encamped you said brother Wayne Amen I tell you what I've got myself in some problems I don't know if the Lord went there or not David said though I hide myself in hell though I make my bed in hell thou art with me listen to me you can't out running tonight you you can't listen he said I will never forsake Thee I will never forget thee though a a mother might forget her suckling babe I can never forget you God cannot forget you in the middle of your trouble it's time for you to tell that Devil he's a liar he's come to rob you and to persecute you and to take your joy and the stealing of God out of your life but you met a preacher tonight that's not going to back up he's not going to walk off he's not going to get tired and just say oh well let them do it on their own I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to preach the word of God until every devil is broke until every Spirit has been put under our feet we are not here just to put a little word out we're here to see a divine Deliverance of the power of the mighty God we are in an age of Truth and in an age of Liberty this is an hour when the word has power when the church has power when truth is Anointed and it brings a freedom into the house of God oh come on church it was the angel of the Lord and he brought a Deliverance to the house of God you know what I'm talking about some of youve been under some things here lately and I'll tell you the angel of the Lord's here to deliver you you said preacher another service no sir I don't think we ought to back up I don't think we ought to wait I don't think we ought to say well there'll be another day amen David heard in the days when the Philistines come in the valley he said God should I attack this enemy he said listen David you wait you wait on this and amen and I personally been waiting a few services to get this Old Devil you wait and you wait until you see the rustle in the mberry tree and when you see that rustle you will know the angels have entered the battle and when those angels come in you go into that battle let me say something here tonight the angel of the Lord is in this place tonight and he didn't come here just to stand and speak to you he has come to deliver he's come to deliver lives and to break off those things that have been hanging on to you brother Wayne I don't like your tone let me tell you I don't like the devil I don't like what he's doing I don't like the pressure he puts on the house of God I don't like the things that he throws at the ministry I don't like what the devil does and as long as I'm alive he'll get no peace in the house of God as long as I'm a preacher the devil will not get peace in the house of God so brother way you make me uncomfortable listen if you got a devil on you tonight I pray to God you're the most uncomfortable person in this building until you left the angel of the Lord deliver that off of you oh so brother Wayne I don't know this Bible tells me that Daniel said the angel came for the purpose of Deliverance that's why he came he came to deliver he delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt he delivered Jonah out of the belly of a whale are you with me he J he delivered Joshua from the grip of his enemies he delivered David out of the jaws of a Goliath he was a deliverer then and he's a deliverer now his nature is a nature to deliver he's a God that has the ability to deliver he is still the the angel of the Lord he was a deliverer when he come into Daniel's Den God was a deliverer that night he said preacher that's all the way back then well what did Paul meet when he met on the road to Damascus when Paul was going to kill some Christians he wasn't in a Den of Lions he was under the thicket of theology he had a bondage of some doctrine that a man had put on him and he was under the bonds of that Doctrine and and he was literally trying to destroy the work of God because of the doctrine that was in his heart and God was merciful enough to meet him on the road and let the grace of God deliver him from the teachings of Gia and to be translated into the revelation of Jesus Christ when that light flashed across his life he said Lord who are you scripture will answer now who is the Angel Daniel sace the pillar fire according to the Book of Exodus it was Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant but Paul said Lord who are you he said I am Jesus I am Jesus whom thou persecute can you imagine persecuting a Christian is persecuting Jesus Christ to persecute a Believer is to persecute Jesus Christ look at what he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest and Paul went away and wrote Hebrews the 13th chapter and said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now look what happened when Apostle Peter was taken into the jail and he was laying deep in the dungeon that night remember what happens when they come in there and they bound him but there's a prayer meeting going on and they're praying for deliverance to come to Peter who came for his Deliverance who came for his Deliverance the Bible tells us that he was fast asleep I believe it was and there was something coming the room and smote him on the side and woke him up and I'll tell you this right now if you ever see you're in the presence of the Angel of the Lord it'll wake you up it'll wake you up amen it'll make you aware that you're in the presence than more than just a bunch of humble people the Bible tells us that he loosed Peter from the chains that he loosed him and he led him out of the prison Gates isn't that powerful and to the place he was delivered by the angel of the Lord amen if you want to watch it in the scripture Paul and Silas they was captured put into prison and while they were in the prison amen something happened in there they could not stay in the bondage of man they were innocent the only thing they done was worshiped God but they were being put in bondage and while the bondage was upon them they begin to worship ship God and why they begin to worship I don't know what kind of tune they were singing I don't know if they were in harmony but I know something happened that God honored what they were saying he honored have you ever have you ever noticed amen sometime you get a good anointed song leader I believe brother Ben's a good anointed song leader we get brother Ben up here and he gets to moving around a little bit and when he finds that certain song and the presence of God just fills the room amen because God's pleased he likes what's being sung he likes it he begins to move on it all of a sudden Hearts begin to be delivered lives begin to be changed because the presence of the Lord is changing lives look Apostle Paul when the when when the singing started the earth started shaking I asked brother way if I could just preach he said yeah I could so the earth started shaking and when the earth started shaking what happened the old the old bars couldn't hold it you know what happened to those bars something shook them loose amen you know what you know want to shake a loose a a man from a devil you don't want to shake him loose I tell you what a prophet said will do the shaking he said it'll take those seven unknown Thunders to do it amen that's what he said wasn't it and he said that's the kind of Thunder the devil's scared of is when a life is being lived it is a voice of Revelation and it shakes up the devil's Kingdom and while they were being shook up I was noticing this the other day it went when those bars Begin to Fall there was a gentile amongst them who was a Jailer can you imagine being the guy that was to keep Paul in jail utterly failing can't keep this guy locked up and when the when the walls Begin to Fall do you know he was going to take his own life he was about to commit suicide how many ever read it you notice something Paul couldn't see the man it was in the darkness he wasn't close to where Paul was but out of the darkness Paul screams out and says Don't Take Your Life Soldier Boy amen don't you take your life as a God here to deliver you amen we've heard that same voice in this last day when there was a young man sitting in a meeting and the same light that was in the prison with Paul was in the meetings with William Bram and when they begin to feel that way that Spirit would speak out don't take your life soldier boy there's a greater Deliverance God is a deliverer Jesus Christ is a deliverer he's a powerful deliverer he was a deliver in Daniel's day he was a delivering Paul's day and the Bible said that I have come down in Revelations the 10th chapter and he came for the purpose of Deliverance I've always been amazed at the vision brother bandam tells about about the people when they're trapped in those in those bars I've always been amazed when brother bam tells about a vision or a dream that he has where there's a host of people and they're in these cages and brother bam is saying to them what's wrong with you and they said brother bam we need more now brother Ram knew the one man he had some he had some problems with his eyes his eyes had been had been cast over and he he wasn't able to see good he said we need more brother brandom and they were in there them people he said brother brand these people in this are good people he said they just misunderstood you how many people today are in a cage because of misunderstandings because they misunderstood him they were in that cage but you look at the mercies of God brother bam said I seen that angel that Pillar of Fire turned into a rainbow over there and spoke to me and said deliver this people and brother bam said there I was he said and I thought how could I ever do it how could I ever do it and the Lord said you deliver these people and brother Bram said I spoke up and he said I felt the strength come into to me and he began to say house of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ and he said the bars Begin to Fall amen what was going on there was a strength that come into him because he found own the purpose of God in the age he was living in God came to the Earth to deliver the church from denominational thinking from ideas and the mark of the beast he came to deliver the church from the things of this world and set them at Deliverance in this hour that same Jesus is in this building today come on now I can prove to you by the Bible for the next 20 minutes if it would take it but just take my word he said wherever two or three are GED in my name there I will be in the midst of them the same angel that was in a Den of Lions is here in True Word Tabernacle tonight the same angel that was in the jail with Apostle Peter is here in the building tonight the same angel that met Paul on the road to Damascus is in the building tonight he's not here to hurt you he's not here to whip you he is here for your deliverance to deliver you to let you leave a free person brother Wayne I'm not in the Lion's Den tonight [Music] no but look at the Devils that are surrounding today look at the demons that are surrounding the people in this hour I'm sitting here testifying to you tonight I didn't get saved till I was 21 years old I lived a life before I was 21 and as much as I'm living for the Lord I was living for the devil and let me testify to you tonight my God is a deliverer yes sir brother brandom said I never drank or smoke or defile my body in any way and God used him to prove that he could keep a man God used that man in a azerite vow and it's a it's a testimony I wished I had my wife holds that testimony she told me one time said Wayne I don't have a testimony like yours I said no you got one like brother brandom's never drank or smoke or defile or body in any way but I don't have that testimony but my testimony says he is a deliverer my testimony says you can be an aent of lions and God can deliver you amen my testimony says you can be a pit of Destruction and God can deliver you I'm saying that his ear is not too heavy and his hand is not too short you cannot get to a place that my God can't reach you you can't get into the deepest darkest recesses of your mind you can run all you want to but you'll never hide from this light it'll reach into your life it'll reach into your heart I remember I remember I was just just turning just after 20 years old moving toward 21 right in that phace of my life I've been chewing Copenhagen since I was about 13 years old and we grew up it's tobacco you put in your lip like an idiot you know and you you don't just chew it I chewed it my Grandpa chewed it I guess it's where I learned it and and you learned it but then you couldn't you couldn't chew it all the time so I learned to dip it learned to smoke it and tobacco took a hold of my life it took a grip of my life and when I got ready to give my heart to the Lord it was one of the biggest hindrances I had in my life was tobacco but you know what I kept coming to the house of the Lord amen and and I got to I got to coming in night after night sitting on the front row there every time they'd have a prayer meeting I'd go pray with everybody asking the Lord for deliverance I'd get up and leave the building go out there set in the car and put a chew the back in my mouth some days I'd make it two or three days between the time I I I'd make it a couple days and but before Sunday would come I'd had to have me a chew couldn't help it I'd come in the house of God I'd be condemned about 3/4 through the service I'd make my mind up i' repent Lord I won't never do it again Lord I'd get out the door here itd come back see I had a heart to not do it but I was seriously in bondage it was not that I wanted to do it I didn't have a choice people say well I'm free I smoked and drink and all that no you ain't free try to quit it and see if you're free you're not free it'll take a deliverer to take that out of you people say well I quit smoking and I quit drinking but you never did quit Desiring it did you but if God ever takes it out of you if God ever delivers a man he don't just take the Habit he takes the desire of it out of your heart I can testify tonight my God can deliver a man of tobacco there's a boy sitting right back there brother Johnny come into a little Fellowship one night and we were preaching he come up to me after service and I saw a tobacco can in his front pocket and I started telling him how God delivered me amen and and and when you preach against tobacco or something somebody's doing the first thing they say well I just won't go back to church that's the worst thing you ever done how you going to get cleaned up if you don't come take a bath I told my mama I said Mama I don't want to be a hypocrite I don't want to go to church and then chew that debacco and come to church and she said Wayne she said do you have you ever cleaned up to take a bath or do you take a bath to clean up I said I take a bath to clean up she said then coming to church is taking a bath you come to church and let the washing of the water of the word take those things off of but see the modern day we're living in nobody wants nobody to preach against nothing anymore they don't they want to they want to Joe oin gospel little lollipop and hand out popcorn and ice cream amen bring out the drinks and fill up the pews I'm not interested in filling up pews I'm interested in filling up Heaven I want to see converts to the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen we got oh God help me we got we got a bunch of preachers anymore they they ain't got enough confidence in God to preach an experience they don't have enough confidence in God to preach a Deliverance but I have been delivered I can promise you that if you approach the same God I approach you will get a deliverance from that God I know they're cutting the cost they're running specials on it now you can be the bride if you just believe a certain Doctrine they cut the cost but it's a useless piece of uh it's a huh it won't get you nowhere now when you cut the cost of this gospel let me promise you this this birth is the cost for every man it'll cost the same P same thing to every person that ever did it but whenever you give your life to the Lord he'll clean you up I preached that to brother Johnny sitting right back there and I don't know was it a month or two amen he sits here tonight he never fooled with that stuff no more he's a free man because God is a deliverer some of you sitting here were cigarette smokers but you're not sitting here a cigarette smoker tonight because God was a deliverer I told that testimony in a meeting a man come up and stood in the prayer line and said brother Wayne the way you preach it toaca is a spirit I said that is the truth and the Same Spirit of toaca that makes you want it and spend your money making you stink and your and your lungs being deteriorated is the same spirit that gives life to cancer that'll kill you and destroy your family amen why would you ever defend the devil that destroys as many people as cigarettes does Amen but God has come to be a deliverer in the house of God I know it's Thursday night but it's the truth stood over there in India man walk up to me was a hind served 100,000 Gods after a meeting he walked right up to me he was dressed in his indu priest robes and had this Big Dot on his head had that they call him uh what do they call them man buns now well I ain't such a thing he had his hair and a ponytail looked like a girl and then a dress had a DOT on his head and he said to me he said are you a preacher I said I am I'm a Christian he Saidi want I want to ask you for help I said 'what can I do to help you he said 'you can see I'm a priest of the Hindu religion I said I can see that he said listen he said I have worshiped every God In My Religion he said I am suffering as an alcoholic and it's destroying my family and my life and there's nothing I can do to get loose of this it is destroying me he said but I heard I heard that that Jesus that you serve he has the power to deliver a man he has the power to break these kind of habits I said brother let me tell you God sent me all the way to India to testify that God can deliver a man from alcohol and you know what we' seen that man come up there a young man he knelt down right there in the street there in India and I laid my hand on that man and begin to pray and God heard my prayer all the way in the streets of India just like he does in this building tonight the same God that was in that n's Den with Daniel that same God that was in there with Peter came on the streets of India and delivered a Hindu priest of being an alcohol listen this message is more than theology it's more than a bunch of doctrines and building churches this is the Angel of the Covenant that has come to deliver a church and to take them in a Rapture it's come to give you life it's come to give you power it's come to break the n it's come to deliver you of the depression and the suicide Spirits you don't have to take your life why don't you let the deliverer come in this building tonight why don't you face him one time say God I'm inviting you I'm inviting you into my life come into this lines them with me tonight yeah he'll deliver alcohol yes he'll deliver toaca yes he'll deliver immoral Spirits yes he will take a life and change it he can can take the gutter most and put them in a pull pit to preach the power of the Redemption oh can our musicians come God can change it God can change everything you know what this Bible tells me if you just keep reading for a minute it says that Daniel come climbing out of that Line's den and when he come out of that den of liines that King took his accusers and turned around and throw them in that Line's Den let me tell you something the Bible said that they were devoured before they hit the ground they didn't even hit the ground before the lies had got on them amen do you see what it is God always does it he always does it read the book of Esther and see that when Mori and hmon were having a fight hmon decided I will destroy that man of God and he hung on his own Gallows amen God used Goliath's own sword to cut off his head God will do it every time amen if God before you who can be against you God will turn the table on the devil and place you back in the power of God listen he's the god of Heaven he's the god of power he's the god of Deliverance and he's my God he's your God he's not just Daniel's God I like to done a backflip today when I was reading that and I seen that angel and brother B ties it directly with a pillar of fire that's in his meetings amen let me tell you this he ties it directly without a doubt then that means something to me the same God that I serve is the same God Daniel was serving it's not another God it's not like that God it's the same Jesus Christ brother why why you so excited cuz I done I done read the end of the story and I does seem that God throws that devil right where he's been trying to throw you have you ever read about the power of the blood you know it can transform you and transfer your life Chloe you you know the power of it can take you and change it can change everything it's powerful isn't it how it changes there's one portion of the power of that blood that's amazing to me as an individual brother brandom said it had the power to transfer your sins from you to the head of the devil it has the transferring power if you get under the blood the sins that's on you actually end up on the devil and the devil is thrown into the Lake of Fire for sins that he would have had you commit of the problems that was put upon you brother brandom says it goes right back to the head of the devil sitting right here tonight friends Our God he is a god of Deliverance and he's a mighty God he's a mighty God my brothers brother Ben can you help us tonight amen he is a mighty God he is a god of grace and mercy he is
