you all it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen see everyone out on this Thursday evening amen what a what a time to serve the Lord amen um we so appreciated the the moving of the spirit of the Lord on Sunday and the blessing of his grace to come by and to bless us what a what a supernatural time to experience the Lord I I believe we're I believe we're living in special times amen I believe that's the hour uh for these things to happen I've heard but now I see brother Bram said let the inspiration strike you he's here and he said then Let It Strike you that this is the hour amen I I think it's time for it to strike us amen with a with a Grace amen let's just bow our hearts tonight for a word of prayer if you have a special need let's just remember as we go to the Lord father it is a great honor of ours to be here tonight to speak to your people and father what you have in store for your church Lord we're we're here tonight to just to yield ourselves to that we heard your Prophet speaking today by tape and he said Lord that there are many gifts in the body teachers and pastors and evangelist and missionaries and speakers with tongues and visions and but Lord he said the problem is is finding someone to yield to it and I pray tonight father that we be a yielded vessel Lord we're not wanting to show a an intellectual ability or human power but father we're asking you tonight to let us yield our soul lord to the omnipotent one that you could speak one word in this place tonight Lord and lives would be forever changed hearts Lord would be renewed Spirits would be healed Lord and father a Grace would be given to your people and we ask you tonight that you would just use us Lord you you'd speak something and Lord we will acknowledge before the people tonight that we have no AB abilities within ourselves and Lord if anything good happen we give you all the glory and the honor for it father you're a merciful god and we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we'd maybe just like to take a few moments in the scripture for the Book of Daniel the 11th chapter and uh I want to just pick back up here in this 32nd verse um it say a very very powerful verse of scripture and I I had a lot of things on it that I just barely got started in it on Sunday and the spirit of the Lord just kind of took over it was time to time to worship a little while and amen in the 32nd verse Daniel 11:32 and to such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits God bless you tonight as you may be seated I just want to take a a few minutes tonight in this and I'd like to just continue in this exploits of Faith um and having this in the background of our mind that this is going to tie into the third pool of course but I want to I just want to take a few moments into this scripture and and it it it it has got it's got a lot in it amen it's got a lot in it uh the scripture speaking here in Daniel chapter 11 saying but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do great exploits uh I like how this begins saying the people amen telling us then that this is not just an individual person but this is a group of people it's people who uh it will be involved it'll be a people now I know sometimes that that's a very general statement the people but that it actually is speaking of someone when you go to the book of Hosea remember the scripture prophesies that the people who were not a people shall be called the people of God and over in the Book of Romans Paul said that's not in Hosea is not speaking of the Jew only but it's also speaking of the Gentile as when Abraham was told that his seed shall be as the stars and as the Sands of the sea speaking of the people who were not a people but become a people that's where the scripture says you're are a chosen people right amen and seeing that the end time message brings that closer to you when over in Revelations the 18th chapter and the fourth verse it said come out of her my people and remember when brother Bram went beyond the curtain of time and the six uh that tells it in the fifth seal there real real PL he tells how that he went beyond the curtain of time and while he was there he seen a lot of people coming and they said are these all Broms he said oh no he said these are your converts and those people were the people who were followers of this message were wearing white robes amen and they had already been beyond and they all said of course if you hadn't come we wouldn't be here amen so so the people that I'm talking about are actually in scripture uh but I believe that there are alive today and I personally believe that there's some of those people sitting in this building tonight I believe that we are uh uh that we are privileged to speak to the people uh that Daniel saw in this Vision that many years ago I know that's a an amazing thing but to think about tonight that God could foresee and and I I would challenge anyone to to the scripture upon the theology that God fornew foresaw and fores spoke of this end time bride it's easy for us to look at the scripture and we could see Jesus and how he was predestinated and we can see him in the prophecies and and we could see him spoken in the word but the prophet tells us that his mystical body is just as predestinated as his physical body and she is spoken of the same as was his natural body that came from Mary so is this end time bride spoken of in scripture and as he stepped out of the Old Testament and become the Fulfillment of those prophecies so is the bride stepping out and becoming the Fulfillment of the prophecies that was given to them now so I I believe today that of course the scripture would speak it in a symbol but then the symbol has to become a reality at some point and when the Thunders are revealed how many knows brother B said that's when the symbol was taken off and it become a reality because the voice of God reveals it amen it actually brings the revelation of it and and to see now this the people uh the Bible said that do know their God so the people that do know their God I I I'm saying that this is an end time prophecy uh that it's spoken for the end times so I'm speaking to the people of the end time the people that do know their God Amen when I when I when I think of this I think of those people uh that are to show up in the end time as that blood-washed bride uh people that do know their God Amen now they they if the people that do know their God now of course here if we look in pH Philippians chapter 3 uh Paul said this that I may know him in the power of his resurrection that's how we're supposed to know him is in the power of his resurrection now s would see Jesus brother bandam says he said now we could know him to know him by the word he said to know him by the word it's all right but it's a long ways from being sufficient to know him by the word we've got to know him by the person of his resurrection amen now of course here and you must be borned again uh brother Bram will say this he said the true word comes to the true prophet he said and he tells you the true word and you follow that true word you will get a true experience of that word because the word is made flesh in you I like that don't you the word comes to a prophet you follow the word and the word leads you to an experience of the word it'll make the word become flesh in you of course this is the age that the people are to know God they're to know him in the way that he is revealed there's a lot of people miss him and the prophet said the reason they miss him is because they miss him in the Simplicity of the way he reveals himself they they miss God because they don't see the way he reveals himself because God both hides himself in Simplicity and he reveals himself the same way amen now if you can uh see that this is the age amen I I I I would say that if we are looking in the Book of Luke the 24th chapter I believe that we could see a prophecy of these same people that know their God and do exploits I believe we see a prophecy of these people in the tub that's on the road to EMAs when they were walking and they walked a six-hour journey brother B types it with this with the church ages and how that there's a a people that hear the gospel for the six ages he said but watch in the end time when it become the evening these two goes in the room with Jesus right at the end right if the evening and the Bible says in Luke 24:31 and their eyes were opened and they knew him and their eyes were open and they knew him now what did Jesus do to them that made their eyes open now we're talking about end time prophecies uh they there was something here that made them know that it was him they they actually seen and knew it was him brother Adam said the way he opened their eyes is the same way he opened the eyes of the woman at the well it was the same way he opened Peter's eyes when he told him who his father was and what his name was it's the same way he opened their eyes so the Messiah sign or the sign that the church would know him would not be revealed to the end time so this prophecy is not laying for another day but it's actually a current prophecy for the age we're living in again we can look in John 14 and the 20th verse the Bible said for in that day you shall know him Amen in that day you shall know that I am in the father that you in me and I in you now what day is that brother bam said it's the day when the Revelation is made known that's the season that we're living in amen that's the reason this message has come is to make you know him that's the purpose of the message that's the reason he's appearing in the last day how many knows the Bible prophesies this in 1 John chapter 3 and it says when he shall appear he said You shall be like him for you shall know him as he is that's right so it takes an appearing of the Lord to know him it takes a revealing of the Lord to know him so if the Bible prophesies and says you shall know the Lord amen do you see it's it's not saying I will reveal myself but it's saying that you will know him which tells us that there will be a revealing of him just as he prophesied in Luke 17:30 and said in that day when the son of man is revealed and how many ever heard brother B say the day he shall be made known so in the season of making known that's the season of the church that's the hour so so what would it be for God to make himself known and nobody there to recognize it amen as it is such in sometime some of the message uh directions in the end time amen everybody Stacks everything up in brother brandom and they place it on the prophet and it's all something 50 years ago and now we're just here putting things together intellectually and trying to progress the church in knowledge and training and intellectual things and and I'm I'm for reading the books and you can tell by the way I preach that I study the message believe the message but you see you can take the words of God and put them together with intellectuals and that's not God Amen intellectual power is not God that's the reason there's so many intellectual Christians is because there's a lot of intellectual preachers an intellectual knowledge produces an intellectual power so that's why people will stand and Proclaim their ability in the resurrection because they say well I know this and I know this and I know this and I know this but somebody's got to know him the power of the Resurrection The Power of the Rapture somebody's got to experience that amen and then the Holy Spirit can use gifts of the body amen that those gifts ad Ministry the holy spirit will take things that truly are the word but he'll put them together by the spirit and when they're spoken they will release the spirit and and many times when the spirit is released from a from God anointed Ministry and God anointed gifts when the spirit is released and somebody who's intellectual will run off and say well that's just emotional but I I won't stand still to allow people to water down the moving of the Holy Ghost as some experience of emotionalism or some Pentecostalism amen it's the power of God under salvation it's the power of God that delivers hearts and fixes and and we're we're here under brother Ericson who's who's not a big counselor or psychological fell to try to counsel everything out of everybody he's a little like I am and believe in the Holy Ghost will fix things amen if we can turn the Holy Ghost loose it'll fix depressions it'll fix marriage problems it'll fix issues it'll fix things you ain't even talked to us about because the Holy Ghost is a discerner of the thought and the intents of the heart amen I seen the Holy Ghost released in this church on Sunday and I've seen things fixed the people been carrying things in their Spirit little depressions and troubles and we've been praying Lord how is this going to be fixed amen but I tell you what to fix everything is to get God in the room one time and let the Holy Spirit turn loose upon the church and he'll make the weak say I am strong and he'll make the poor say I am rich he'll give them something to testify about the power of God I think it's time to release the anointing the church and to take the limits off of God to let the Holy Spirit deal with hearts and deal with lives amen come on now that's a yielding preacher and a yielding congregation we can't ball up every time a little correction comes across the platform every time the Holy Spirit begins to deal with the life that's not a time to ball up and get your feelings hurt and get mad at the preacher that's a time to say oh me that's the truth anyhow I'm going to stand in the house of God and let the spirit of God not deal with my life because if we're ever going to take a rapture we will do it not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts we are looking to change our bodies from a mortal body to an immortal body and how are we going to do it through an intellectual power the intellectual powers of this world has got things so messed up they don't know whether they're boys or girls they don't even know if God created the Earth people don't know they're in confusion they're through into Bottomless Pits of man's ideas but God has still got an anointing upon his word that'll make you know that there's a God and there's a reality to these things my when I think about it tonight I think about the people that's going to know their God Amen the people that know their God Amen I believe there's some people in here tonight that know God I believe we really know him in the power of his manifestations we welcome him in the power of His realities we know him see see see we know his nature we know his character that's why we can go through hard things but if you know God amen sister sus the Bible said all things were together for the good of them that love God and to them are called according to his purpose the devil would try to make you think that God was behind the storm but brother bam comes along and he said the storm the winds would have never hurt you till the devil got into it amen so the devil's your adversary amen that's the reason sicknesses they don't come from God it comes from the devil that's the reason we can fight it that's the reason we can stand up in this age because we know the nature of our God my when I think about this tonight I think that there's a people amen believing people amen that he should appear in the last days to bring these people back to the word that she would know her husband her mate the revealed word you'll know him like a woman knows her husband that's pretty intimate that's a powerful way to know God Amen now brother Ram says this is when amen the church is brought into full Covenant again the Covenant of the church he took his physical body and he gave you his spirit so the Covenant that you have with God is his Spirit without his Spirit you don't have a covenant without his Spirit now now I I I could take this to the scripture I'll give you one scripture and then I'll move on in Romans the 8th chapter said he that hath not the spirit of God is none of his amen you don't belong to God without the spirit of God it's your Covenant with God you're not Jew by your natural birth you are only a Jew by a spiritual birth and you become the Seed of Abraham by the spirit the spirit of God must quick you to put you into these promises you're dead until the spirit of God quickens you in Ephesians chapter 1 they said he whom he hath quickened or has made alive it takes the spirit of God to do it now that Spirit was justifying the Holy Ghost was justified in the days of Luther he was Sanctified in the days of Wesley but the Bible says that the Covenant is to be brought into a full strength in the last days that's the spirit now brother B I'm going take this this to the book of Isaiah the 28th chapter in the message the true witness and he'll read the scripture for in the day shall the Lord of hosts be a Crown of Glory and a diem of beauty under the residue of his people and the spirit of judgment to him that Seth in judgment and watch and for strength them that turn the battle to the gate the spirit shall be strength unto them that turn the battle to the gate brother bam says it like this Isaiah this great man foretold the coming of the Holy Ghost if we go I can read it let's just read for a moment and find out about the coming of the Holy Spirit Isaiah let's read in the fifth verse and brother man begins to read it in the day of the Lord the the Crown of Glory he's speaking of this great day when the witness comes when it is our Crown the holy spirit is our Crown isn't that amazing that's the crown of the church is the Holy Spirit and the diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people amen Now isn't it something the residue the people that's left over he'll be a diadem a Crown of Glory a diadem then think 700 years before it happen the spirit of judgment to him that sth in judgment what does it do it takes it do at the altar for strength to them that turn the battle then them who is standing for him and with him this great spirit the Holy Spirit that's prophesied will be the strength of him that stands at the gate in the battle he is our strength we rely upon him not upon culture not upon education not upon the things of the world not by might or by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord the church rest solemnly in that he will be the strength of him that stands in the gate not his theological background not his denomination but the Holy Ghost will be his strength he will be the one that stands in the gate he'll rely upon the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn the alien away again Isaiah prophesied it said it would come to pass that he would send his Spirit it' be a Crown of Glory for the church a strength for him that stands in the gate how would we know it was the spirit because the Bible said with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak unto this people and this is the rest and the refreshing but brother bam said but for all of this they wanted an organization and their denomination rather than the spirit is a Crown they wanted a denomination as a crown rather than the spirit as a crown they wanted intellectual power as a crown rather than letting him be the crown of the church to be the to be the Showcase of the church they want something else to show their building their organization their abilities amen but the real crown of the Church of the Living God is the spirit of God that comes among them amen he is a refreshing amen the presence of God is a refreshing to a man and the Bible said with stammering lips in other tongues will I speak unto this people see that's why David said for the Lord is my strength and blessed is that man whose strength is in the Lord remember the scripture from strength unto strength amen from increasing Victorious power amen a strengthen the church by the spirit of God Amen I left you here on Sunday Paul uh uh uh actually David amen prophesied about a strength to a strength move moving from Victory to Victory amen but in numbers we found Caleb who was a follower remember the the the the the the the first part of the quotes that we read to you the true word comes to a true prophet and if you'll follow that true word you'll get a true word experience amen and Caleb had a following Spirit what was he following the prophet of the hour Moses amen and the Caleb of this hour will be following the prophet of this hour a true word prophet and if they will continue to follow Jesus said this to his disciples if you'll follow if you'll continue in the truth you shall know the truth and the truth is what's going to set you free if you're going to get free tonight the truth's going to set you free the truth the spirit of the word will come in as a deliverer and he that the sun sets free he's going to be free indeed there's nothing like the freedom that when the Holy Ghost releases a a man of his of his ideas and of his troubles and the situations of his life my freedom like you've never add in your life isn't it beautiful to be free in the spirit isn't it beautiful to believe for the things of God and to allow his Spirit to come amen it's like Caleb who was 85 years old amen and said I'm as strong as the day I was in the day that Moses sent me my strength even so more strong now for war to go out and to come in therefore give me this mountain you see what he was saying I'm not going to let these amalekites or these anx or any other a take anything that Moses said I could have and I believe there's a Church of the Living God that'll fully follow this message and if this Prophet prophesied that that would be a bride in strength in this hour she won't keep fighting until she possesses everything that the message says she could have this this message said we can have an experience with God this message said these signs shall follow them that believe this message said that creative power will come into the Church of the Living God this message says that we will become as a minority but we will grow in power and in strength and there will be a people on the Earth that who will be alive in the day when God changes a body from a mortal to an immortal somebody so full of the Holy Ghost until every every fiber of their body oh Church of the Living God I do not believe the Rapture will be a intellectual experience I believe it will be an intimate spiritual experience with almighty God I believe it'll be a so falling in love into the presence of God until you're changed from one dimension to another dimension I know what I'm talking about I've been in the spirit of prayer until I feel a quickening take a hold of my tongue take a hold of my eyes take a hold of my mind begin to tie things together and put me in another dimension tell me things that's about to take place and prophesy to me in my inner chamers the same spirit of God that saves you the same spirit of God that deals with you is the same spirit of God that will leads you to every promise this Bible said you could have we are join HS to every promise that Jesus Christ made to the church and we're not going to give up on one inch of this ground I think we should learn from Israel amen we cannot trade land for peace it will not work you cannot give up land and get peace with a devil every piece of land you give up the devil's taking more if you give up the the right of creative power he'll take away your right to pray for the sick you give up your right to pray for the sick he'll take your joy he'll take your happiness he'll take your faith he'll make you a Weak and Powerless church but there's a pride in the last days that not going to give up one inch of the ground that God has given we have already had prophecy over our lives we have been prophesied over oh God I believe there's a church amen that's riding this Trail again I believe there's a church that is prophesying again I believe there's a church who's on the ride tonight we got the sword in our mouth we're on a Vindicated word and we're going to ride down every devil and get him between the church and the promises of God church this is not a time to let off this is a time to press the battle this is a time to press like you've never pressed before press against it until the anointing of God drops into your life my Lord what an hour to serve God what a day to serve God the holy spirit will be your crown n it's nothing to get ashamed about the Holy Spirit ain't something to be ashamed of it's something to welcome it's something to welcome in the church it'll it'll heal the sick babies amen it'll heal the sick Minds it'll take care of situations that we don't even understand but God is still a God who is able to do the things that he prophesied that he would do don't you think you give up a little land you're going to get some peace that's a devil line to you well we might as well go ahead and preach about it haven't we amen one of these well some of these girls get a little Victory and dance out in the aisle Devil comes and says well he man did you do the right thing is that what you should have done then they get worried because somebody thinks one thing somebody thinks something else and then the Devil comes and says well if you just wouldn't do that anymore you wouldn't have to worry about that but you know the problem is the minute you back up on God the spirit of God leaves you and you get depressed you get discouraged you don't have the ability to surrender no more cuz you're terrified of what might happen happen when you let go well let me tell you tonight I've lost my fear of men and what they can do to me I say let go and let God have his way in the Church of the Living God let the power of God fall in the church amen the only thing they can do is kill me the only thing the world can do is kill me and that would release me that would release me to go in the presence of God like I've never been in my life I believe it's the hour let the Holy Ghost come in a way it's never come yielding in a way that we never had well somebody's going to think we're Heretics but I'm with Apostle Paul and Ray Ericson and the way you call heresy is the way I worship the god of my fathers the way you call a nut Willam Brandon said it why why I am a Holy Roller yes sir I'm identified right there a Holy Roller a nut a holy ghost filled man but at least I'm yielding to something that is giv life back to me that's given strength back to me Satan has come but he's come to kill you and to steal and to Rob your joy and to Rob your blessing but let the spirit of God bring strength upon you KN him invite him bring him in let him yield your life to him now I know what I'm talking about you go to Quench and the spirit and you'll find a different kind of God you going to quench in the spirit the brother R knows what I'm saying cut God off one time say I'm not going to do that let him call you and you say I'm not going to do it you'll go backwards 100 m hour but if God's calling you it's time to answer the call if God's dealing with you it's time to say Lord I'm ready for you to deal with my life if he's trying to give you the Holy Ghost it's time to surrender to the Holy Ghost if he's trying to take over over your family say God come and take over my church take over my family take over my life let's let him have the right away let's give him the blessing let's throw out a red carpet for the Holy Ghost come on let's throw out a red carpet for the Holy Ghost let the Holy Ghost come let the Holy Ghost anoint let the Holy Ghost use us let the Holy Ghost worship let us Worship in spirit and in the truth hallelujah I'm a Believer in it I'm believe I'm a Believer and I believe if we let our songs Be Sung of the spirit we would get more Spirit out of them come on church amen our hearts brother Ben got up here on Sunday follow the leadership of the lord we just kept walking in the Lord until after a little while amen the spiritual anointing begin to turn over and he released something in the building it wasn't even through the gift of Minister it was through the gift of song We Believe In singing I'm tell the Holy Ghost Falls we believe in singing until worship strikes the building and God makes a bunch of men and women cry and scream and beg and dance in the spirit of God we are believers We Are Holy Ghost fil Believers not going to give up an inch I'm not going to give my praise to no devil I'm not going to give my yielding to no devil I'm not going to live in fear of what happens when the Holy Ghost comes I say God come on it might be tonight that our bodies are changed Oh Glory to God I believe it's the hour for it I believe these exploits are more than just healing for sick I believe they're more than just a gathering together I believe the exploits that's going to be done in the church amen the Bible said limbs can be added I believe we're living in the season of it that you can speak the word of God and it'll be as you said I believe we're living in the season you are one word from the the change of your body you're a to be sitting here on a night just like tonight and the gospel being preached to you and the word released and you receive it and you feel a change start coming over you come on if it can change you in the spirit why can't it change you in the body you come in here sometimes in you're draging and you can barely get in the door but about 20 minutes into the sermon something starts churning you start feeling better what's it doing is changing you is changing you from the natural to the Supernatural and the Holy Ghost is here to change us in one of these days he will change us from the natural man to a innatural man or a supernatural being in God I believe it it's not an hour to be weak in the spirit it's not an hour to back up on the spirit of God this is an hour to go forward with all your heart and with all your might God if you want to use me use me Lord you want to speak through me speak through me Lord you want to deal with me deal with me Lord I'm not going to cut you off what business do we have to tell God he don't have a right in our lives what business do we have to tell God you can't do that through me Lord amen why wouldn't we be a yielded Church why wouldn't we be a yielded vessel why wouldn't be yield as young people have you got to be 40 years old before God can use you I don't MO believe it I believe God can use any of these young men and women in this church I believe he can use them in the gifts I believe he can use them in the ministry I believe he can use them in song he can use them in anointing and he can use them to pull on the word of God until tell the Holy Ghost falls in the church with anointing and with power that's what I believe I believe the crown of any life is the spirit of God I believe the crown of any Ministry is not how well you can put the word together it's what happens when the word comes does the spirit of God back up what's being said that's what I want to brother mam said the spirit of God ought to be with every Minister that ministers there ought to be something behind it not just a man saying something there ought to be a life behind it there ought to be a changing power on the inside of it well I might as well just go ahead and preach since I'm this far in right sometimes we go to preach and the spirit of God Falls amen the power of God changes lives and hearts and it's an anointing it's not a pep rally it's not me trying to draw somebody to myself it's the releasing of the anointing of God and it's designed for the end time to strengthen this bride it's not for me it's not for the church it's for the people who's going their God to get strength out of that message until the power of God would fall into the room man heard me one time and they couldn't explain they couldn't explain away the spirit moving so they decided I had a familiar Spirit they they tried to make it something bad since they can't make since they can't say that something don't happen when I preach they try to make it something bad happening when I preach I bet I tell you what happens this is what happened I was a hilly amen without Education Without ability no social upbringing didn't know how to use my knife and my Fork Heen embarrassed in crowds with people with money cuz I didn't understand the social part of life don't know politics don't know how to get along with people amen but I met a god one night at an altar and with a burning light he came into my heart and identified me as a son of the Living God and before I knew what Matthew was or what Mark was or what the Book of Revelation was there was a gene ignited on the inside of me that identified me as a son of the Living God and nobody can take that away from me me and the God my father called me into the ministry to preach the word to his people and by that Commission of the spirit of God that's the reason he people are healed that's the reason people are saved that's the reason the anointing comes because if I had my way about it I would go hunting somewhere I'd go run a dozer somewhere but the god that birth me is the god that called me and I have no choice but to yield my spirit you said preacher what are you doing I'm telling you that's me that's me as a preacher but what about you as a Believer don't you have the same Authority as a Believer if you're in your position the same way I'm in my position then your amen will do what my preaching will do your a man will change the atmosphere of a room you're at come on now talk to me had it right she changed everything in the room she changed the atmosphere in the room and because of one amen she was a woman in her position with God and she opened up the anointing in the room and you in your position have an ability to open up a channel an anointing to come in this building tonight you ain't got to be somebody special you are special before almighty God a channel a conduit it come on now you may not be the boisterous type like we are jump up and holler amen and Shout amen I'm I I have to be honest I think we ought to have freedom to do it but I don't think you have to do it I think what you have to do is yield your spirit and let the Holy Ghost use you and if a Qui amen it means as much as my yelling in heaven because it's a pull of Faith it's a cry of faith it ain't how loud we are it's how powerful we are and you're the most powerful force on the face of the Earth glory to God somebody better open up the door let the devil out of this place tonight I don't think it's healthy for him to be in here amen there's a church that's on fire that come from the Bible we are not a bunch of crazy people we are a Bible believing Holy Ghost Field church I'm the Living God saying God if there ain't nobody left we're here tonight to yield to the anointing to yield to the spirit of God because the Bible prophesies Jesus the Bible says you'll do it I'm not I'm not insane this is the Bible the Bible said Abraham being not weak in faith there it is him not being weak in faith he considered not his own body at a 100 years old neither would he consider the deadness of Sarah's womb he wouldn't talk about none of it you know why that Abraham was not weak because he had met somebody that had given strength he didn't know if it was 25 years or 50 years or however long he met somebody that had give him strength strength to believe the Bible said he did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief now his promise was the changeing of his body you've got promise of the Holy Ghost you've got promise of every Covenant promise and benefit in the message look at this the Redemptive rights that God has given the church they're a promise to you it's not your wishful thinking it's not your hopeful thinking it is a promise of the God who can't lie who has made this Covenant to the church and I will not stagger at the promises of God through unbelief but the Bible said he was strong he was strong amen and giving glory to God and I believe tonight I'm preaching to a church that is not we in faith we are not a bunch of weak Believers that can't handle the message we can handle the son of man we can handle the Third Exodus you can handle Rapture and things that are to be because we are not a premature bride we are not a presuming bride we are not an infant bride we are a mature bride in the presence of An Almighty God we know who we are we know the position we hold and we know every promise that God has made to us and we're not backing up on one of them [Music] oh no sir she was strong Abraham was strong and you know what this church is it's strong amen amen to the Bible said he was not weak it actually means to be weak is to be feeble to be without strength to be powerless you're not feeble you're not without strength and you're certainly not powerless but on the opposite Amen to be strong is to be endured with strength is to be strengthened to receive strength to have an increase of strength to receive strength you're not going offer your strength we have received we have received strength you say where're in is we receive strength is amazine that almighty God appeared unto Abraham in Genesis the 17th chapter it was the almighty god brother bam said the breath Ed elhad appeared to Abraham and he said he was breasted showing that God was giving access to his life he was inviting Abraham to the life of Elohim but he was doing it through the breast of elhi he was allowing him the strength of God through the breast of promise and brother B is teaching the church at our Eli is Jesus Christ and when he give his word you see it's like a mother who who reveals her breast to her baby the life becomes accessible through the milk are you hearing me and the life of God becomes accessible by the message of the hour in your generation amen and God has made an appropriation or an accessibility to the life of God when when Abraham latched onto the breath of eladia he brought strength into his body and he was being strengthened for the promise that Elohim made so Elohim him uses El Shadi to bring strength to fulfill the promises that he has made the almighty god brother BR says the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost elhi is your Holy Ghost it brings the strength of the promises of God into your life that's the way that God gets strength into the church is through his life Source now it's amazing because somebody would say brother Wayne what's different today than used to be well in Revelations the chapter the Bible say in the same season that Daniel prophesies the church will be strong the Bible says in Revelations 10 that a mighty angel will descend Out of Heaven A Mighty Angel is a strong Angel a strong Angel shall come out of Heaven one who is clothed with a rainbow he has the Covenant it's not a covenant in his weakness it's a covenant in his strength he's bringing all of the Promises of God with him we don't have time to go through them but watch them seven Church ages watch how the rainbow lays over the pyramid and a color represents virtue and a color represents Temperance and a color represents godliness but when you come to the Capstone it's not one color of the rainbow it's the entire rainbow coming to the church a collection of everything that God has been in the days of the church ages he is coming now as a crown he's capping theur Church off in the person of the Holy Ghost the Lord himself shall be the crown of the Church of the Living God it'll be the very person the very Perfection of the word of God that will come and Crown I know it's been said in the book of Isaiah amen they that wait upon the Lord you know the rest of it they shall renew their strength sure they will renew their strength they'll Mount up with wings say Eagles and they shall run and not be weary they will walk and they will not faint look what they done they waited on the Lord those that wait on the Lord do you see they meant other ages have tried this but they were in front of God and they and as Moses went in head of God down in Egypt and killed one man trying to fulfill the exploits that Abraham had prophesied he failed in his commission and was sent to the back side of the desert wondering if the promises were even true because he didn't wait on the Lord he got ahead of God but when God met him in a pillar of fire the anointing of that fire gave to Moses what he lacked in the beginning he received the attributes of Elohim through the Vindicated word of his age and he saw God face to face and the minute he saw God he went he went into action he went to doing what God Said he was supposed to do and even argue with the Lord about the ability to do it I can't do it lord I can't do what you've called me to do I can't fulfill the commission that you gave 400 years ago I've tried it and I've tried it and I've tried it and amen oh God if you ever be a tri amen you'll begin to wonder if these promises are ever true but they that wait upon the Lord oh when that Holy Ghost strength comes it's a different kind of strength now some people amen they put the coming of the Lord off so far in the future I don't know if the church will ever get any strength come on Church they put all the healing in the Millennium they put all the Miracles in the Millennium they put the spoken word in the Millennium well let me ask you what are we going to need with miracles in the Millennium come on what are we going to need with the spoken word that can put a bone back in a woman's foot correctly what are we going to need with that in the in the millennium we need that now we need people of God engaged with the strength of the Holy Ghost now that's why I preach the promises of God that's how the strength comes into the church they that wait upon the Lord now I know they put this so far out in the future that we ain't never going to become a strong Church a mighty church amen I I keep asking the question if not now could you tell me when well brother wne they that waited upon the Lord I love that scripture they'll not faint in 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul said therefore see and we have this ministry we have receiv received mercy and we faint not we have received this ministry what Ministry has the church received in this hour they have received a a Ministry that Paul said that was manifestly declared Paul did not come with enticing words of man's wisdoms but Paul came amen and brought forth the church in power and demonstration we bram's Ministry amen is a repeat of Paul's Ministry amen bringing the church in the ministry of Declaration among the church if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost William Brandon declared the presence of Jesus Christ in this age without one Shadow of Doubt there should be not one doubt in the church tonight you said brother Wayne someday our strength's going to come let me let me propose something to you in re aans the 12th chapter the Bible said I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren has been cast down which accused them before God day and night and they the people overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony they loveed not their lives unto death I say to you now is come the strength of the Bride now is come the Salvation to the right you said brother Wayne how you placing it now cuz the strong one brought a book in his hand and he opened that book and revealed the names of the people who were to be in the Rapture in the last days your strength to survive the Antichrist is your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life your strength cannot be deceived as a genan seed of the inside of you that can only receive the Holy Ghost now there's some reason you couldn't swallow all that intellectual nonsense because the seed inside you couldn't be satisfied in that portion but something in you kept calling and and John said now is come strength and now is come salvation when the accuser has been cast out what of the place Satan has been in your place since the fall he stood in your position in a Heavenly place and has claimed you have no rights to it he has claimed you have no hold or no claim on the covenants of God but the message of the hour came the Bible said there is no more place found for that devil what happened God opened up the book and he showed that the devil had no place in your life whatever he's done he had to do because he cannot go into eternity with the Church of the Living God I love to tell the devil all the time you can't change in time what God God done in eternity he said I'll change your destination I'll do this and I'll do this he don't have the power to do it he don't have the power to change your life he don't have the power to defeat you he don't have the power to send you to Hell the first seal revealed it he's a BL he's a defeated being God gave him no strength but the strength tonight lays in the hand of every believer of God tonight my Lord me tell you where the devil hitting you at let me tell you where he's hitting you at he talks you into robing a bank then cause a law on you he he's he's I don't have a better way to say this but he's piling around in your thought life and he's getting you to think a wrong thought and then condemning you for that thought and saying to you there's no way to repent of something you never even did you only thought of and he was the one that gave you the thought so because you know the Lord he'll say to you you can't even repent now he says it's impossible to ever really make it right with God but do you know what impossible means it means there's no space impossible means there's no way to fit it in but something that's possible means there's a space or a place it's probable it's possible listen now what is impossible is that the devil in his time or in his attribute could add one sin to the name on the Lamb's Book of Life because there is no space in that book for a sin it is impossible to add sin to the name of a Believer I tell you what you ought to do tonight you ought to tell that devil I am a blood bought son of the Living God I'm an anointed child of God by the power of the Holy Ghost and you will not affect me my strength comes from the Lord my strength comes from Revelation my strength to stand come on Church I'm not a supernatural being how do I withstand demons in the prayer line tell you how you do it young man I don't care what devil he is he has to recognize the name of Jesus Christ every knee will bow at that name I don't care how big the devil I don't care the name of the devil my Bible said he's a name that is highly exalted he has been exalted above every name he has been exalted above every sickness every devil every disease every thought all you got to do is cry the name of Jesus Christ and stand behind the blood Covenant of the lamb and every demon will have to bow every Power will be broken see now has come salvation when that book is open you tells H the devil you ain't got no place for Satan there a song Somebody sent me some time ago I don't know if you don't like that style of music you might think of I'm a little odd but it's a black brother he's singing it's a real good tune he said don't you let that devil don't you let the devil ride in your car he's saying he said Don't Let The Devil Ride don't you let the devil ride and in a minute he'll say don't you let him ride cuz he'll want to drive don't you let him ride cuz he going to want to drive Satan going to want to drive the car but there's a church tonight says you're not in the driver's seat of this car matter of fact you ought to stop the car and let him out tonight you ought to stop the car right now open the door and say get out of here Satan you don't have a place in the church you don't have a place in the family you don't have a place in my car you don't have a place in my life it's time for the Church of the Living God to remember who they are in your thoughts and in your heart and in your prayer and in your church we are not begging something we are not backing up to something you are worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ Thou Art Worthy you're not a bunch of Orphans you're the sons and daughters I know they tried to make us a bunch of rejects but we are not oh we might be rejected in certain circles but up in heaven brother the Angels Rejoice the night you gave your heart to the Lord up in heaven I tell you what was happening Sunday Lord stood up there and he said I want you angels to come watch something this morning and they started emptying the corridors of Heaven and the angels of God started circling the building watching these young ladies dance in the spirit watching the spirit of God begin to move through the church on the atmosphere of faith and anointing and reality listen friends I believe this is the Church of the Living God that feels the attributes of the experience of God and and and and and we won't limit this we don't limit this to emotion and just a feeling but it's a change it's a change and it's moving over our lives it's moving over our hearts amen it's a change now has come strength now has come honor said preacher why would you say now cuz now the Messiah is here right now the Messiah is here he's on earth now he said preacher why would you say that we have seen his son as our musicians would come tonight what an hour to live what a time never been no day like this one you flip through your pages of your Bible and wished you was in another day but you do me a favor when you're done you list all the Miracles done in the book of Acts and then you come talk to me about this ministry of William Bram in one meeting there was more done in that meeting than there was in the entire book of Acts why so you'd know him that's right God revealed it to strengthen you for them that stand in the gate I will be their strength I'm glad he is tonight I'm glad the promise is laying there I was listening to the Eagle St at this Nest I've been doing a little Dozer work and listening to a lot of a prophet and brother Bram said he seen that old Eagle down in the blowdown he said I looked over there he said he wasn't a bit a bit scared of me he said Lord what are you trying to show me in that eagle he said them Wings was his gifts they were god-given and he knew that he could trust them Wings to get him out of the the danger of that man he said see it's telling you should lose your fear if it's god-given I don't believe we had to fear a god-given gift if God's anointed a man to preach I believe you ought to just let the anointing come and let him preach don't fear it release yourself and let the the Holy Spirit use you if God's anointed you to sing Release Yourself he he anointed you to play Play Let the anointing come if he gifted you to be a believer and be a deacon or a trustee or whatever it don't don't fear what God has given I don't believe we had to fear the Holy Spirit tonight I believe it's god-given power to come to strengthen us can we stand our feet tonight oh have Own [Music] Way own way thank you Father father th the [Music] high would you sing it with me me and after thy [Music]

Jerusalem the city of David they were killing an oxen every six steps blood killing an oxen every six steps now if you sometimes want to know about worship worship is always it's not always maybe a jump maybe not always just a a loud joyful feeling but in that moment David was both dancing and killing sometimes worship is killing something and sometimes that those things that are there in your life is preventing you from letting that word come rich and pure sometimes we need to kill some things some things need to die some things of our own will our own desires the way we want things the way we we sh should be if we begin to let it die maybe little things that we picked up Little habits in our lives situations where things are starting to encroach they're challenging you for your time

him throughout eternity he'll be revealing himself there are facets of God right here that we don't we don't know we ain't realized yet wouldn't it be something right now if you'd let a little something die and the great Spirit of anointing and Revelation move on you and reveal something to you that you've been wondering for years a little facet of something open up and become a key maybe
