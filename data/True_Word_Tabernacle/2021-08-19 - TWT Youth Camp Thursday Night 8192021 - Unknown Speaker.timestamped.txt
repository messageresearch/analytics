[25:26] that's been in my heart for
[25:27] for uh right about 15 years actually
[25:31] to do things like this for the youth and
[25:33] i just appreciate that the lord's made a
[25:34] way
[25:35] and so our vision for the camp of course
[25:37] is that the young people would have the
[25:38] best time that they possibly can have we
[25:40] want you to have a good time have a lot
[25:42] of fun and just do everything that we
[25:44] can
[25:45] to provide that and secondly
[25:48] uh i want you to make a friend

[25:51] least one friend this weekend i want you
[25:53] to break out of your comfort zone if
[25:55] you're a little shy find somebody who
[25:56] isn't

[25:59] and i i want you to make connections i
[26:01] want you to meet new people
[26:03] you know a friendship a christian
[26:05] friendship is one of the greatest gifts
[26:07] that god can give a young person

[26:11] are helping to to run this this camp
[26:14] meeting this weekend are people that i
[26:15] went to youth camps with
[26:17] and so they uh
[26:19] and even today we have that strong
[26:21] relationship that goes beyond just
[26:23] friendship beyond common interest
[26:25] it's the connection of the family of god
[26:27] and that will be a that'll be a guiding
[26:29] force in your life if god can give you a
[26:31] friend this weekend it'll be a powerful
[26:33] thing in your life
[26:34] and the greatest vision of the camp is
[26:37] that you would have an experience with
[26:39] the lord
[26:40] that you would have an experience with
[26:41] the lord
[26:42] if you've never had a real experience

[58:13] i'm willing to fight for you here
[58:16] and
[58:17] certainly certainly proud to be standing
[58:19] in this moment with young people that
[58:21] are standing for a message
[58:23] that is
[58:24] that is such as
[58:26] just as powerful today as it ever was
[58:29] and uh we know that
[58:31] we know that god is bringing up a
[58:33] generation that will cast satan down
[58:36] and uh
[58:38] we bring greetings from our pastor
[58:40] brother ron and and the church there
[58:42] full gospel lighthouse and i just would
[58:44] like to send their greetings to each and
[58:46] every one of you as well and i'd like to
[58:48] say how how much of an honor it is for
[58:50] us to be standing here
[58:52] in this moment in time we're very
[58:54] excited to be here it's been about 20
[58:56] years since i've since i've been in this
[58:58] building and
[58:59] a lot of things have changed in the last
[59:01] 20 years i i was one way when i was here
[59:04] 20 years ago
[59:05] but i'm here a different complete
[59:07] different man this evening and it's all
[59:10] because of this message
[59:12] it's all because this message i owe i
[59:14] owe my entire life to this message and
[59:17] and uh
[59:18] we appreciate true word tabernacle and
[59:20] brother ray and all the efforts uh going
[59:23] into this into this camp and i know they
[59:25] have a great love for the young people
[59:26] and it's been expressed to me from
[59:28] brother nathan and brother ben how much
[59:30] they've been looking forward to this
[59:32] but i wonder if we could just bind our
[59:34] hearts together
[59:36] this this evening
[59:37] and agree
[59:39] that we will expect the supernatural
[59:41] this weekend
[59:43] i believe that if you come expecting
[59:45] that god will meet your needs
[59:47] i believe that if you you so desire
[59:50] this evening i believe that he can show
[59:53] himself to you in a pillar of fire and
[59:55] in the form in the form of a cloud i
[59:57] believe that he's i believe that he's
[59:59] willing to show himself to each and
[1:00:01] every one of you and i believe with with
[1:00:03] all of my heart if you come here seeking
[1:00:05] the baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:00:07] you'll get it
[1:00:09] you'll get it
[1:00:10] and you know if these if these walls
[1:00:12] could talk
[1:00:15] i'd say they'd probably look around and
[1:00:16] say oh no not them people again
[1:00:21] but oh if we could hear another world
[1:00:23] this evening speak
[1:00:25] i've seen that jesus in a people before
[1:00:28] not again
[1:00:31] so let's just bind our hearts together
[1:00:33] as we get ready to go to the word this
[1:00:35] evening let's just
[1:00:37] offer up a sacrifice of praise and
[1:00:40] prayer just now
[1:00:42] and let's just if it doesn't make you
[1:00:43] feel uncomfortable lay your hand upon
[1:00:46] your brother or sister there and let's
[1:00:48] just unite our faith just for a moment
[1:00:51] let's call on the god of heaven
[1:00:54] heavenly father we approach your throne
[1:00:56] of mercy just now

[1:01:25] good as your word
[1:01:26] that you will supply all of our needs
[1:01:29] and i pray tonight in the name of jesus
[1:01:31] christ that you would bless your people
[1:01:33] i pray the mighty angel would come and
[1:01:35] stand behind this pulpit and set me down
[1:01:38] over in the corner
[1:01:39] use this body just for a few moments in
[1:01:42] time here lord jesus
[1:01:44] and i pray that you would reach out all
[1:01:45] the way to the the back of this building
[1:01:48] may the pillar of fire be seen in this
[1:01:50] building tonight

[1:01:53] supernatural god of heaven that has not
[1:01:55] lost one ounce of his power show forth
[1:01:58] your majesty in this place lord i pray
[1:02:00] that you begin to pour out your holy
[1:02:02] ghost upon these young people
[1:02:04] lord that that we would set in this
[1:02:07] place lord

[1:02:17] and all the children of god say amen
[1:02:21] amen if you have your bibles this
[1:02:22] evening we'd like to look over in the
[1:02:23] book of genesis
[1:02:25] chapter 3
[1:02:27] genesis chapter 3
[1:02:30] and verse 1.
[1:02:33] we don't have a minute to waste here
[1:02:35] this weekend
[1:02:37] we don't have one minute
[1:02:39] so why don't you look over at your
[1:02:40] neighbors and let's have church
[1:02:42] let's go
[1:02:44] i'm not i'm very mindful that a lot of
[1:02:47] you've been traveling today some of
[1:02:48] you've been traveling throughout the
[1:02:49] night
[1:02:50] so i know that you might be just a
[1:02:52] little bit tired but
[1:02:54] but i i promise you this that if if
[1:02:58] if you a man fast i'll preach fast
[1:03:04] so i'd like to speak to you there
[1:03:05] all right well let's get started
[1:03:10] i'd like to preach to you this evening
[1:03:12] on a thought on not negotiating with
[1:03:14] satan
[1:03:16] not negotiating with satan and my theme
[1:03:18] this evening is satan you lose
[1:03:25] brother branham said in satan's eddie
[1:03:27] satan's eden he said i would like he
[1:03:29] said i wanted to speak to you something
[1:03:30] to bring something to enlighten you
[1:03:32] to the promise of god for this age
[1:03:36] something not something that somebody
[1:03:37] else was in some other day but something
[1:03:40] and them things are all right we all
[1:03:42] refer to those things but i thought that
[1:03:44] i would try to bring something to your
[1:03:46] mind with these scriptures
[1:03:48] i got written here that would enlighten
[1:03:49] you to to make you a better soldier in
[1:03:52] the field that you're fighting in
[1:03:54] now to learn the tactics of the enemy so
[1:03:57] that you can block everything before it
[1:03:59] gets to you
[1:04:00] that's the main thing
[1:04:02] is to keep the punches off of you as
[1:04:04] much
[1:04:06] as you can
[1:04:07] genesis chapter 3
[1:04:09] verse 1
[1:04:10] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:04:12] of the beasts of the field which the
[1:04:14] lord god had made and he said unto the
[1:04:16] woman yea hath god said
[1:04:19] you shall not eat
[1:04:21] of every tree
[1:04:22] of the garden
[1:04:24] notice her response and the woman said
[1:04:26] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[1:04:28] of the trees of the garden but of the
[1:04:31] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:04:33] of the garden guard god had said you
[1:04:36] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:04:38] touch it lest ye die
[1:04:41] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[1:04:43] shall not surely die
[1:04:46] for god
[1:04:47] doth know that in the day you eat
[1:04:49] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[1:04:52] and you shall be as gods knowing good
[1:04:56] and evil may god bless his word you may
[1:04:58] be seated in the presence of the lord
[1:05:01] i'd like to set before you just for a
[1:05:03] few moments as we
[1:05:05] make ourselves comfortable in this place
[1:05:07] set before you two different pictures
[1:05:10] that were laid at the foundation
[1:05:12] of the garden of eden as you begin to
[1:05:14] look with me as we kind of take this
[1:05:16] journey
[1:05:18] there you see as we walk into the garden
[1:05:21] of eden you begin to look and
[1:05:23] there you're watching two two of god's
[1:05:26] creation as they're walking down through
[1:05:27] the garden of the eden
[1:05:29] and as they're making their way down
[1:05:31] through the cool of the evening as
[1:05:33] they're they're walking down through
[1:05:35] there
[1:05:36] and there you can watch as as leo the
[1:05:38] lion is is following them and that
[1:05:41] of the the tiger begins to follow them
[1:05:43] and they're as gentle as kittens as
[1:05:45] they're making their way down through
[1:05:46] the garden
[1:05:48] and there begins to be a breeze as it as
[1:05:51] they're nearing close into the cathedral
[1:05:53] where they would go in to begin to
[1:05:55] worship under the palm trees where they
[1:05:57] would worship worship god and there
[1:06:00] comes a great big breeze across across
[1:06:03] the garden there
[1:06:04] and it begins to stir
[1:06:07] stir eve's hair just a little bit she
[1:06:10] didn't she had spent a lot of time with
[1:06:12] her hair that evening put the curlers
[1:06:14] and everything just right
[1:06:16] and she she's got everything just set in
[1:06:18] order and it was just a little bit too
[1:06:20] much for her and adam began to speak to
[1:06:23] that that wind that it would settle down
[1:06:25] and he would say peace be still and
[1:06:28] then you can watch as as they're
[1:06:30] entering into that cathedral that you're
[1:06:32] that you're watching that all of a
[1:06:34] sudden this is this is yellow amber
[1:06:36] light began to come down in the cool of
[1:06:38] the evening and there
[1:06:40] god began to worship with them they
[1:06:42] began to speak to them and said children
[1:06:45] how was your day here on earth how was
[1:06:47] your time here today did you enjoy it
[1:06:49] and i apolo god have come down to the
[1:06:52] garden this evening to kiss you good
[1:06:54] night and to lay you down and as adam
[1:06:57] lays out his arm and
[1:06:59] and eve lays her head over on adam's arm
[1:07:03] and she begins to fall to sleep and then
[1:07:05] god walks over and it begins to lay down
[1:07:07] each and every one
[1:07:09] of the animals and the beast of the
[1:07:11] field everything's in perfection
[1:07:14] everything's peace everything is calm
[1:07:17] everything is in order there's no sin
[1:07:19] there everything is perfect there's no
[1:07:22] diseases there there's no such thing as
[1:07:25] mask there there's no such thing as
[1:07:28] germax there there's no things there
[1:07:31] that are contrary to the word of god
[1:07:34] now notice this picture it is set in
[1:07:36] perfection but let me bring into another
[1:07:39] picture just for your just for your
[1:07:42] imagination just for a moment i would
[1:07:44] like to bring in
[1:07:46] here is what
[1:07:48] eve is looking at
[1:07:50] but this is not what was offered to her
[1:07:53] this is the picture that is set before
[1:07:55] her
[1:07:57] would she receive this picture
[1:08:00] now as she walks out into the garden
[1:08:02] everything's dying
[1:08:04] the wind is so staunch it's so so starts
[1:08:08] there's no there's no breeze to it death
[1:08:11] seems to have entered in all the leafs
[1:08:13] are beginning to fall off the tree where
[1:08:15] she'd one once had picked berries off of
[1:08:18] the off of the branches now those berry
[1:08:20] branches now have thorns and thistles
[1:08:22] off on them all of a sudden you begin to
[1:08:25] get this sick feeling running over top
[1:08:27] of you and and then you're you're
[1:08:29] watching all of all of all the dramatic
[1:08:32] things of the day as as sickness rolls
[1:08:35] on a rampage there's no way that when
[1:08:38] satan came to eve in the very beginning
[1:08:41] that he offered her this type of picture
[1:08:44] he never offered her that there was
[1:08:46] going to be battles he never offered her
[1:08:48] that there would be unborn children that
[1:08:50] would have diseases he never offered her
[1:08:53] that there would be bloodshed he never
[1:08:55] offered those things but because she
[1:08:57] stopped and listened to the wrong thing
[1:09:01] you see she didn't she did not just
[1:09:04] disbelieve in god she believed in god
[1:09:06] she did not just upset the whole program
[1:09:09] or she didn't just say that she didn't
[1:09:11] believe in what god had said but she
[1:09:14] simply listened to one word it was not a
[1:09:17] full sentence it was not it was not a
[1:09:20] full paragraph but it was one word and
[1:09:22] he came in and it looked so close that
[1:09:25] he began to disbelieve and begin to look
[1:09:28] over in to another world and because of
[1:09:32] that satan said to her that i am going
[1:09:35] to offer you this if you'll just eat of
[1:09:37] this thing you will be like god you'll
[1:09:39] see like god you'll have wisdom like god
[1:09:42] and it looks so close and you and i can
[1:09:45] never sin against god until we turn down
[1:09:48] the very word of god and here man in the
[1:09:51] beginning before the adam or eve could
[1:09:54] ever ever disbelieve they had to lay
[1:09:56] aside the very word of god and that's
[1:09:58] what eve did she simply laid down the
[1:10:02] very word of god and you see what
[1:10:04] happened when she began to negotiate
[1:10:07] with satan and have a conversation that
[1:10:09] that god is a good god that god's a
[1:10:11] great god and she began to have this
[1:10:13] conversation and what notice what
[1:10:16] happened it got her kicked out of eden
[1:10:19] you see satan's offer was so close to
[1:10:22] the truth that it caught the very
[1:10:24] attention of god's creation now right
[1:10:26] away you and i would sit here we would
[1:10:28] say as in the intellectual people and
[1:10:30] and people of god that we would
[1:10:32] definitely turn down any negotiations or
[1:10:35] any debate that satan would throw at us
[1:10:37] but throw at us but many times we don't
[1:10:40] realize that it's the devil that is the
[1:10:42] one that is negotiating with us because
[1:10:44] he comes in in such a very slick way in
[1:10:47] a very shrewd way and if you begin to
[1:10:49] look at that word subtle it means shrewd
[1:10:52] it means sly and it means sensible and
[1:10:55] many times when you begin to deal with
[1:10:56] the enemy and you watch him he comes in
[1:10:59] a very sensible way and he comes in and
[1:11:01] he begins to negotiate with you and you
[1:11:03] say well that seems very sensible and
[1:11:05] you watch but he comes in and he's and
[1:11:07] he's so deceitful and how he does
[1:11:09] business and he he comes in he and he
[1:11:12] and he shows you he shows you these
[1:11:14] things but if you can look at that thing
[1:11:16] and if it doesn't line up with the very
[1:11:18] word of god you can recognize that it is
[1:11:21] not god it's not the spirit of god but
[1:11:24] it is the enemy and he's very wise he
[1:11:27] he's not like some people paint a
[1:11:28] picture of him with a pitchfork in his
[1:11:30] hand and he's got he's got he's got a
[1:11:32] hook for it for tools and but satan's a
[1:11:35] real slicker he's full of wisdom he's
[1:11:38] he's educated and the bible tells us in
[1:11:41] second corinthians 11 and 14 for of no
[1:11:43] marvel that satan himself has
[1:11:46] transformed himself into an angel of
[1:11:49] light and many times satan when he comes
[1:11:51] to people he offers them or he appears
[1:11:54] to them laughable or absurd and people
[1:11:57] don't fear him and he persuades them to
[1:11:59] think that his attacks aren't real or it
[1:12:02] makes people feel like feel like that
[1:12:04] that he isn't really something or he's
[1:12:06] just a bad thought or or he's just
[1:12:09] something that's floating around in the
[1:12:11] air but satan when he comes to you with
[1:12:13] negotiation tactics over whether you can
[1:12:16] broker over this agreement or come to
[1:12:18] this agreement or not but he does not
[1:12:20] show you the end result when he comes to
[1:12:23] negotiate with you when satan comes to
[1:12:26] you young people he will offer you
[1:12:27] pleasure he will offer you a good time
[1:12:30] partying with your friends he he doesn't
[1:12:32] show you he shows you a good time on the
[1:12:34] road he shows you a good time party and
[1:12:37] he shows you having a wonderful time but
[1:12:38] he doesn't show you the hit on
[1:12:40] collisions by a drunk driver he shows
[1:12:43] you you being the best gamer in the
[1:12:45] world but he doesn't show you having a
[1:12:47] warp mighty he shows you have and all
[1:12:49] these actions of being cool and being
[1:12:52] hip and being being popular in the day
[1:12:54] but he doesn't show you a broke up home
[1:12:56] you see he can come in and he may offer
[1:12:58] you something good and it doesn't seem
[1:13:00] very very evil but when he begins to
[1:13:02] offer you something every single time
[1:13:05] his offer will lead you to destruction
[1:13:07] and brother branham said that all satan
[1:13:09] wants you to do is just try one time all
[1:13:13] he wants you to do is listen to the rock
[1:13:14] and roll one time all he wants you to do
[1:13:16] is try one cigarette and then he's got
[1:13:19] you from right there he ain't trying to
[1:13:21] tell you that you'll get addicted but
[1:13:22] he'll try to tell you that you're gonna
[1:13:24] have a good time but brother branham
[1:13:26] taught us that if there's ever a
[1:13:27] question in our mind to not listen to it
[1:13:30] and to leave the thing alone but satan
[1:13:33] will offer you a hope and a peace and
[1:13:35] he'll offer you a good time but let me
[1:13:37] say this to you young people peace with
[1:13:39] the devil is a fake peace this ideology
[1:13:42] of the day where we think that we'll
[1:13:44] live and let live with the devil when
[1:13:47] you're recognizing when you look at an
[1:13:49] enemy that well let's just live and let
[1:13:51] live with it the only way that satan can
[1:13:54] exist is if you go down in defeat it's
[1:13:57] when he requires that you die and he
[1:14:00] gets exalted on high
[1:14:02] he wants to come in and offer you some
[1:14:04] kind of a good time but he doesn't show
[1:14:07] you what's coming down the road
[1:14:10] i uh there i heard a story one time
[1:14:12] about this this hunter that went out
[1:14:14] into the woods and he was looking for
[1:14:15] some bear meat and he was he was out
[1:14:17] there and he was hunting and he he took
[1:14:19] his rifle out there in the woods and he
[1:14:21] was he was out there and the first thing
[1:14:22] he'd come he seen this big black bear
[1:14:24] coming down through there and he he
[1:14:26] pulled up his rifle to shoot him and
[1:14:27] this bear looks at him and says all of a
[1:14:30] sudden he's seen he's getting ready to
[1:14:31] shoot and he stands up on his back feet
[1:14:33] and he says wait a minute the bear
[1:14:35] starts to speak and says now wait a
[1:14:36] minute shouldn't we sit down and talk
[1:14:39] about this saying maybe maybe it's
[1:14:41] reasonable that we talk about this thing
[1:14:43] and what are you wanting so so the bear
[1:14:45] and the hunter begin to sit down and
[1:14:47] have a conversation and begin to have
[1:14:49] some negotiations and the bear asked
[1:14:51] himself what do you want he's well he
[1:14:53] said i'm looking for a fur coat and the
[1:14:55] bear says well i i'm i'm looking for i'm
[1:14:58] looking i'm just i'm just looking for a
[1:14:59] full stomach and and all of a sudden
[1:15:02] they sit down there and they begin to
[1:15:03] have some compromises and some
[1:15:05] negotiations and after a while the bear
[1:15:08] left alone he had a full stomach and the
[1:15:10] hunter had his fur coat the moral of the
[1:15:13] story don't ever sit down and have a
[1:15:15] conversation with the bear
[1:15:18] if you're talking to bears you're on
[1:15:20] something that i ain't got a hold of
[1:15:22] but let me tell you the enemy will come
[1:15:24] and he will try to negotiate with you
[1:15:26] and try to tell you and give you give
[1:15:29] you your idea and tell yeah you can live
[1:15:31] that yeah you can be in the message yeah
[1:15:33] you can still do those things but i want
[1:15:35] you to know that you are facing an enemy
[1:15:38] that isn't just one to make you sick or
[1:15:40] make you have some kind of complex or
[1:15:43] make you go down with some kind of
[1:15:44] ideology or go down with some stigma the
[1:15:47] enemy that is trying to negotiate with
[1:15:49] you is wanting to kill you he's wanting
[1:15:52] to destroy you and destroy your family
[1:15:54] and destroy or destroy your experience
[1:15:57] with the holy ghost he's trying
[1:15:58] everything that he can to try to bombard
[1:16:01] your mind with all kinds of sin but i
[1:16:03] got news for the devil you are going to
[1:16:05] lose
[1:16:06] we will not negotiate with you we're not
[1:16:09] up here to have a conference with you
[1:16:11] we're not up here to lose we're up here
[1:16:14] to win this thing i am an overcomer and
[1:16:17] if god's going to have one that goes out
[1:16:19] of ohio i'm gonna be that one i have
[1:16:21] been this thing to win this thing i'm
[1:16:23] not in this thing to back up i'm not in
[1:16:26] this thing to back off i'm not in this
[1:16:28] thing to lose i'm in the sink to win
[1:16:30] this thing and proverbs says that's a
[1:16:32] man thinking in his heart so is he and
[1:16:35] if you think you're gonna lose you're
[1:16:37] gonna lose but if you think yourself
[1:16:39] that you are a son and a daughter of god
[1:16:42] that's what you are and as a son and
[1:16:44] daughter of god you gotta rise to the
[1:16:47] challenge and set satan down with your
[1:16:49] offers
[1:16:51] we will not accept
[1:16:53] all of his thoughts and his threats that
[1:16:55] he comes with us
[1:17:00] hallelujah
[1:17:07] hallelujah
[1:17:10] hallelujah
[1:17:11] now we know that satan
[1:17:13] that was the he was the original
[1:17:15] archangel of god
[1:17:16] he was the one that once dwelt
[1:17:19] in heaven he was once he was once there
[1:17:22] as a co-worker he was he was equal with
[1:17:24] god and he was once a great person in
[1:17:27] the heavens and outside of there he was
[1:17:29] the greatest outside of god he was god's
[1:17:32] right hand man to fellowship and he he
[1:17:34] got all puffed up in his heart and he
[1:17:36] began to exhaust his own ideas and the
[1:17:38] bible said in isaiah 14 and 12 how are
[1:17:41] thou fallen from heaven o lucifer's son
[1:17:44] of the morning how are thou cut down to
[1:17:46] the ground which did has weakened the
[1:17:48] nations for thou has said in thy heart
[1:17:50] that i will ascend into heaven i will
[1:17:52] exalt my throne above the stars and i
[1:17:54] will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:17:56] congregation and the size of the north
[1:17:58] and i will ascend above the heights of
[1:18:01] the clouds
[1:18:02] i will be
[1:18:04] like the most high god
[1:18:06] notice all the eyes there
[1:18:09] satan is saying that i will do this and
[1:18:11] in satan's eating and you just bear with
[1:18:14] me just for a moment but brother branham
[1:18:16] said in satan's eden he said and he has
[1:18:18] succeeded in carrying out his threats he
[1:18:21] has certainly had a marvelous success in
[1:18:24] carrying out his threats by the people
[1:18:26] letting him explain away in every age
[1:18:29] the value of god's promised word to that
[1:18:32] age that's how exactly how he's done it
[1:18:34] at every age he explained it the way in
[1:18:37] the days of noah he explained it he
[1:18:39] explained that it was impossible for it
[1:18:41] to reign from heaven for there was no
[1:18:44] rain up there and his great scientific
[1:18:46] gospel that he preached in the garden of
[1:18:48] eden notice the same one
[1:18:51] that was preaching back there in the
[1:18:52] garden of eden was here preaching to
[1:18:55] those them in the days of noah and he
[1:18:58] was telling them that he could shoot the
[1:19:00] instruments to the moon and prove
[1:19:02] there's no moisture up there but god
[1:19:04] said that there would come a rain but
[1:19:06] satan succeeded and poisoned the mind of
[1:19:09] the people by scientific research it
[1:19:12] could not be done but it was done
[1:19:15] god said it would be done and it was
[1:19:18] done and he did it now satan is always
[1:19:21] trying to destroy the very plan of god
[1:19:25] but satan you lose
[1:19:28] satan you lose he could tell you about
[1:19:30] how there was no rain on prayer but yet
[1:19:33] there was a rain up there that satan
[1:19:36] didn't know nothing about there was
[1:19:38] something up there that was greater than
[1:19:40] what he could see and let me say this
[1:19:42] over you this evening satan don't even
[1:19:45] see how in the world you're going to
[1:19:47] make it through laodicea but there is a
[1:19:49] god
[1:19:50] that created heaven and earth he is
[1:19:52] seeing something over top of you that
[1:19:54] satan himself cannot see i want to
[1:19:57] declare to you that there is victory
[1:19:59] hanging over top of you and satan can't
[1:20:02] see that it's there but god is as good
[1:20:04] as his word he's going to make sure that
[1:20:07] it comes to your way and if you come
[1:20:09] here this evening with an expectation to
[1:20:12] have victory you will leave here in
[1:20:16] what's about to victory
[1:20:18] in this place but satan is about to
[1:20:21] [Applause]
[1:20:26] lose your last days
[1:20:32] he's trying to hold you down with
[1:20:34] pornography he's trying to hold you down
[1:20:36] with abuse and suicide when that's the
[1:20:39] way it's got to be my mom and dad that
[1:20:41] way my daddy died that way but god is
[1:20:44] here to say you're not going that way
[1:20:51] i am what god is looking for in this day
[1:20:54] to overcome every obstacle
[1:21:02] hallelujah
[1:21:04] hallelujah
[1:21:06] and look at satan in all of his works
[1:21:09] six thousand years he's been studying
[1:21:11] you
[1:21:12] six thousand years he's been watching
[1:21:14] your dna six thousand years he's been
[1:21:16] building a case against you
[1:21:18] you think about how he has attacked the
[1:21:20] children of god you think about how he
[1:21:23] has attacked the family of god how he
[1:21:25] attacked noah how he attacked moses and
[1:21:28] you think about all this work
[1:21:30] all of his marvelous success that he had
[1:21:33] in poisoning the mind of the people and
[1:21:35] you think about this
[1:21:37] 6 000 years of work for three and a half
[1:21:40] year reign
[1:21:43] he's working all this time knowing that
[1:21:46] he's going to lose
[1:21:47] but satan thinks that he's got the upper
[1:21:50] hand on you let him think that all he
[1:21:52] wants to i'm here to warn the devil we
[1:21:56] won't be putting a corner we won't be
[1:21:58] shut down we're not backing down matter
[1:22:01] of fact the only way that you and i can
[1:22:03] lose is if me and you switch sides and
[1:22:06] you've got a better chance i'm former
[1:22:08] president trump becoming the pope that
[1:22:10] you do have me switching sides i'm not
[1:22:13] switching ties and going over to the
[1:22:15] losing side i'm on the winning side i'm
[1:22:18] gonna win i'm gonna overcome i am more
[1:22:21] than a conqueror
[1:22:26] who wants to come on my side
[1:22:30] who wants to come on my side
[1:22:35] who wants to come over here with your
[1:22:37] short victory

[1:22:52] you don't know what i had to get go
[1:22:54] through to get here brother andrew let
[1:22:55] me say this you're only defeated
[1:22:58] if you stay there
[1:23:00] if you stay down you're defeated
[1:23:03] but if you can get back up
[1:23:05] if you can get back up
[1:23:07] god is as good as his word he'll come by
[1:23:10] your way
[1:23:12] you don't know what i fought just to be
[1:23:14] in this building you don't know what i
[1:23:16] fought just to be here let me say this
[1:23:19] to you
[1:23:20] god is on my side
[1:23:23] god is on your side i have fought the
[1:23:26] past year and a half with a daddy and a
[1:23:28] pastor that's been fighting brain cancer
[1:23:30] you think you've got something to fight
[1:23:32] the children of god have a short victory
[1:23:35] this evening i'm not backing off full
[1:23:38] victory i'm not backing off what i've
[1:23:40] been promised
[1:23:41] if you need healing in your body god's
[1:23:43] as good as his word we're not
[1:23:45] negotiating with him
[1:23:48] he said i am the lord thy god that heals
[1:23:50] all of thy diseases and you are worth my
[1:23:53] fight you are worth my energy you are
[1:23:56] worth this meeting
[1:23:57] god is saying that you are worthy for
[1:24:00] the healing
[1:24:06] you're worthy for it
[1:24:10] it's one thing to tell satan
[1:24:14] i'm not negotiating with you
[1:24:18] but too many times
[1:24:19] people begin to negotiate with god
[1:24:25] they begin to negotiate well
[1:24:28] well i i see i see this person out here
[1:24:31] and i see them act the way they are and
[1:24:33] they they go to church and they they
[1:24:35] listen to the message they play tapes
[1:24:37] but i see they're not living right
[1:24:39] i say i see i see these things so maybe
[1:24:42] i can get by with it too what you're
[1:24:44] doing is you're negotiating with the god
[1:24:47] of heaven
[1:24:49] and you're trying to find a loophole to
[1:24:50] get out of the victory
[1:24:55] you're trying to find a loophole so that
[1:24:57] you can get out of wearing and setting
[1:25:00] in the overcomer seat when you begin to
[1:25:02] negotiate with god and say well i've
[1:25:04] seen this one do it i've seen this one
[1:25:06] come to camps before i seen this one
[1:25:08] dance i seen this one shout i've seen
[1:25:11] this one holler but i still see on the
[1:25:13] backside of their life they're not
[1:25:15] necessarily living right let me tell you
[1:25:17] something just because you see a bogus
[1:25:19] does not mean there's not a reality out
[1:25:21] there
[1:25:23] the best way to you know when you're
[1:25:25] stuttering stuttering studying forgery
[1:25:29] you don't study i got sorry about that i
[1:25:32] got my i got my tongue wrapped around my
[1:25:34] eye tooth and i couldn't see what i'm
[1:25:35] saying right there
[1:25:36] but when you go to studying forgery
[1:25:39] about did it again
[1:25:40] i'm okay i'll promise i ain't been
[1:25:42] drinking
[1:25:44] but when you go to studying forgery
[1:25:46] that's a hard word for a virginia
[1:25:48] hillbilly to say forgery but when you go
[1:25:51] to study
[1:25:52] forgery
[1:25:54] you don't study the false you study the
[1:25:57] real
[1:25:59] because if you can identify the real you
[1:26:02] can identify let me use this word bogus
[1:26:04] that's a whole lot easier for me but if
[1:26:06] you can identify the real you can really
[1:26:08] quickly see what's bogus now you might
[1:26:11] look around here and you say hey i see
[1:26:13] some people they were dancing in the
[1:26:15] spirit last week but on monday i seen
[1:26:17] their facebook just because you've seen
[1:26:20] something fake let me point to you
[1:26:22] somebody that's real
[1:26:24] let me point to you somebody that knows
[1:26:26] what it's like to live and overcome in
[1:26:29] life let me point you to somebody that
[1:26:31] can say i met that supernatural god
[1:26:35] the reason why satan wants you to
[1:26:37] negotiate with him and all of his demons
[1:26:40] he's afraid of a new birth because a new
[1:26:42] birth gives you more power than he ever
[1:26:45] had
[1:26:49] he don't want you dying to yourself he
[1:26:51] don't want you down to that filthy habit
[1:26:56] oh hallelujah but we come to this camp
[1:26:59] to die
[1:27:07] give me a scripture brother andrew all
[1:27:09] right
[1:27:09] paul said i must die daily
[1:27:12] and if paul had to die daily
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:21] now notice
[1:27:22] notice here brother burnham said he said
[1:27:24] if if the man by his intellect will
[1:27:26] finally
[1:27:27] grieve the holy spirit and keep saying
[1:27:29] well the holy spirit keeps saying you
[1:27:31] should and you say well i'm too young
[1:27:33] what if i belong to church but you
[1:27:35] should be born again well if i if i get
[1:27:37] that kind of spit experience i won't be
[1:27:39] able to do this or that or i can't i
[1:27:42] can't go to this or or that well you see
[1:27:45] the devil will tell you that you're
[1:27:46] going to lose some good time you're
[1:27:49] going to lose some privileges but he's
[1:27:51] lying to you
[1:27:53] he's lying to you especially you young
[1:27:56] people oh my you don't have to drink you
[1:27:59] don't have to smoke you don't have to
[1:28:01] run around in these places of amusement
[1:28:03] why the holy spirit is a million times
[1:28:06] better than all the devil could even
[1:28:07] offer you why you don't even have to
[1:28:09] drink on strong drink to have a big time
[1:28:12] sinners do that but you don't have to do
[1:28:14] that
[1:28:16] because i
[1:28:17] been 23 years preaching and i've been
[1:28:20] drunk the whole 23 years on the holy
[1:28:22] spirit it's a stimulation itself it
[1:28:25] never lets up i've always got joy always
[1:28:28] got peace always feel good the lord is
[1:28:31] here if i'm sick and body he's got me
[1:28:34] happy in my soul if things are going
[1:28:36] good things are going good in my soul
[1:28:38] and bad in my body or vice versa it
[1:28:41] makes any difference god is always there
[1:28:45] and i'm always stimulated with a
[1:28:46] pleasure that's joy unspeakable and full
[1:28:50] of glory that's what he does for the
[1:28:52] believer
[1:28:55] oh come on somebody i want you to know
[1:28:57] the major difference between you and
[1:28:59] satan is satan can't live right and you
[1:29:01] can
[1:29:06] it ain't up for debate you must be
[1:29:09] born again
[1:29:12] you're not negotiating with god over
[1:29:14] this you're not negotiating with me
[1:29:16] you're not debating with me about this
[1:29:18] you must be born again
[1:29:24] you remember when brother branham you go
[1:29:26] and listen to him on standing in the gap
[1:29:29] you remember brother branham affair
[1:29:32] you that's familiar with the message you
[1:29:33] listen to him
[1:29:35] he tells you i wanted to be a trapper i
[1:29:38] wanted to go up there and i wanted to go
[1:29:40] up there in the woods and i i'd come
[1:29:42] down whenever i got a vision or whenever
[1:29:44] i got thus saith the lord i just come
[1:29:46] back down and i'd come back down and i'd
[1:29:48] give that out you see what brother
[1:29:50] branham was doing
[1:29:51] he was he was wrestling with his will
[1:29:54] and the will of god
[1:29:56] trying to find a way
[1:29:58] that he could have both
[1:30:01] and you remember what happened
[1:30:03] when brother burnham's there and billy
[1:30:05] looks over there and said that's your
[1:30:07] old friend that's old flex down there
[1:30:09] and and the spirit of the lord began to
[1:30:11] speak to brother branham he said if you
[1:30:12] follow your plans you're going to end up
[1:30:14] that way
[1:30:16] you see
[1:30:18] you see god was gracious
[1:30:21] and you're following a prophet that was
[1:30:23] true he didn't mind telling you that he
[1:30:25] battled his own will
[1:30:28] he didn't mind telling you that he was a
[1:30:30] man
[1:30:31] he didn't mind telling you about those
[1:30:33] things thank god for a true prophet
[1:30:36] if i can look at a prophet and live a
[1:30:38] life like that i say hey that's grace
[1:30:40] for me too
[1:30:42] how many of you been battling your own
[1:30:43] will this week can i live this can i do
[1:30:46] that can i go in or can i go out you've
[1:30:48] been battling all week
[1:30:50] you can sit there and cross your arms
[1:30:52] say man that ain't deep enough for me
[1:30:54] but you ain't living right and you've
[1:30:56] been hiding secret sin in your life so
[1:30:58] you can uncross your arms and go ahead
[1:31:01] and get right so you don't have to sit
[1:31:03] there and bombard your pew
[1:31:07] this ain't a good place to try to hide
[1:31:09] sin at when the spirit of the lord
[1:31:11] begins to discern the thoughts of the
[1:31:13] intents of the heart you better back off
[1:31:16] you better confess your sin
[1:31:19] this is about living right this is not
[1:31:22] about living with two living a two-way
[1:31:24] life
[1:31:26] a man that lives a two-way life is
[1:31:28] unstable in all of his ways
[1:31:36] you remember when brother branham
[1:31:38] miller branham's up there
[1:31:41] and he's starting out in his ministry
[1:31:44] and those men began to
[1:31:46] talk to him dr roy davis is real close
[1:31:47] to him all those other brothers that
[1:31:49] were so-called theologians of the day
[1:31:51] here brother branham was a young man
[1:31:53] having these visions
[1:31:55] having these visions and and these men
[1:31:58] were telling them said
[1:32:00] billy you need to let those things go
[1:32:02] them things are of the devil
[1:32:04] and things are of the devil you need to
[1:32:05] you need to let go of them thing
[1:32:07] that's psychology that's that's for
[1:32:08] something out there in the world that's
[1:32:10] mediums that's you're trying to take
[1:32:11] you're trying to take mediums places you
[1:32:13] see what they were doing
[1:32:15] they were trying to talk him out of the
[1:32:17] supernatural
[1:32:19] they were trying to keep him from this
[1:32:21] ministry
[1:32:23] you see what he was what the enemy was
[1:32:25] doing here were men that were so close
[1:32:28] that were so close to brother branham
[1:32:31] but yet they were trying to talk him
[1:32:33] away from a from a ministry that was
[1:32:36] laying in the bible
[1:32:38] what if he would have listened to him
[1:32:40] you and i wouldn't be sitting here this
[1:32:42] evening you remember when brother
[1:32:44] branham after after hope had died and
[1:32:46] he's there in the hospital room and
[1:32:48] sharon rose is there now that black
[1:32:49] curtain falls down between him and god
[1:32:52] wouldn't hear his prayer you remember
[1:32:54] he's sitting there and the enemy's real
[1:32:56] close
[1:32:57] notice when when god is doing business
[1:33:01] satan is battling
[1:33:06] satan you lose
[1:33:09] you lose
[1:33:12] here he is he's battling it and satan
[1:33:14] begins to battle him over this
[1:33:16] and he says now look over there
[1:33:19] look over there
[1:33:20] he said he couldn't tell me that he
[1:33:22] didn't love me
[1:33:23] but he began to tell me that he didn't
[1:33:25] care for me
[1:33:27] say no i want to remind you you lost
[1:33:29] right here
[1:33:30] you lost right here
[1:33:32] he began to tell him now look over here
[1:33:33] is your daddy just died here's your
[1:33:35] brother just died your wife just died
[1:33:37] you just buried her in the house now
[1:33:38] here here's your little sharon rose
[1:33:41] she's dying
[1:33:43] god don't care for you
[1:33:45] brother branham said it was coming about
[1:33:47] that time when i was just about to say
[1:33:49] you're right
[1:33:51] he said but it come down there to the
[1:33:53] new birth
[1:33:54] he said and then he said these words
[1:33:56] though god slain me yet i'm going to
[1:33:58] trust
[1:34:00] satan you lose
[1:34:02] satan thought that he had the upper hand
[1:34:04] right here but every single time william
[1:34:06] branham walked into a prayer line and
[1:34:09] there was a cross-eyed baby sitting
[1:34:11] there there was never a cross-eyed baby
[1:34:14] that walked away from there living in
[1:34:16] that condition because he was able to
[1:34:18] put himself there
[1:34:20] let me tell you church of the living god
[1:34:22] i know what it's like to stand in your
[1:34:24] shoes and i'm telling you satan will
[1:34:27] lose
[1:34:31] satan lost the battle then and he lost
[1:34:33] the battle every single time when a
[1:34:36] young girl come across there
[1:34:40] when a young boy come across there with
[1:34:42] those cross-eyed eyes
[1:34:44] they left there completely whole satan
[1:34:46] you lose
[1:34:48] you lose
[1:34:50] you lose
[1:34:52] what if it wouldn't have been for that
[1:34:53] new birth what if it wouldn't have been
[1:34:55] for that holy ghost what if it would
[1:34:56] have come down a little further if it
[1:34:58] had not been for the lord that was on my
[1:35:01] side then men would have swallowed us up
[1:35:06] every time you come into a battle
[1:35:08] you have got to meet him with thus saith
[1:35:11] the lord just like when jesus was up
[1:35:13] there on the mount of temptation and he
[1:35:16] goes up there and satan begins to offer
[1:35:18] him these things he begins to offer him
[1:35:20] a compromise he sees him up there he's
[1:35:23] been 40 days hungry he goes up there
[1:35:26] and he's trying to make him prove that
[1:35:27] he's a son of god
[1:35:29] he goes up there and he's trying to make
[1:35:31] god clown for him but god ain't got a
[1:35:33] clown for nobody
[1:35:34] he didn't have to answer
[1:35:36] the devil's question
[1:35:39] he didn't have to answer that but he
[1:35:41] gets to go up there notice his tactics
[1:35:44] he goes up there with the same
[1:35:47] battle that he come against in the
[1:35:49] garden of eden with the lust of the eye
[1:35:51] with the lust of the flesh and the pride
[1:35:53] of life and he said if you be the son of
[1:35:56] god make these stones in the bread what
[1:35:59] was he trying to do he was trying to get
[1:36:01] him to use his power to show that he was
[1:36:04] a son of god what was he trying to do he
[1:36:07] was trying to talk him into something to
[1:36:09] trying to make himself prove that he was
[1:36:12] the son of god notice here it was just
[1:36:15] declared in matthew chapter 3 and verse
[1:36:17] 17 that this is my beloved son in whom i
[1:36:21] am well pleased to dwell notice the
[1:36:24] battle over position begins directly
[1:36:28] after he is placed
[1:36:30] and that's what will happen when you go
[1:36:33] out on the battlefield as a son of god
[1:36:35] you watch you have a target on your back
[1:36:38] and the enemy is hunting you down and
[1:36:40] he's going to try to throw throw darts
[1:36:43] at you but you've been given a shield of
[1:36:45] faith
[1:36:49] and we're well able to overcome this
[1:36:51] land
[1:36:53] there's been a lot of people trying to
[1:36:55] negotiate with us and tell us this
[1:36:57] giants over there in that land of the
[1:36:59] holy ghost there's been a lot of people
[1:37:01] that try to keep us out of this land
[1:37:03] what they're trying to do is try to keep
[1:37:05] you from this born again experience
[1:37:07] but i want you to know there's a promise
[1:37:09] that's hanging over you that this holy
[1:37:11] ghost is for you
[1:37:13] this baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:37:15] supernatural god is for you and what
[1:37:17] they're trying to do is trying to keep
[1:37:18] you off of the land of the holy ghost
[1:37:21] i've been battling that thing ever since
[1:37:22] i ever since i got the holy ghost these
[1:37:25] men were trying to say that was for days
[1:37:27] gone by that i miss my day of visitation
[1:37:32] i'm here to prove to you god still gives
[1:37:34] a holy ghost
[1:37:36] i'm only here this weekend to give
[1:37:38] witness to what the word of the lord can
[1:37:40] do
[1:37:42] and the word will always work its way
[1:37:45] out
[1:37:47] notice when satan comes to him with his
[1:37:49] tactics he said it's written it's
[1:37:52] written he was trying to make him show
[1:37:55] and negotiate over the circumstances of
[1:37:58] life
[1:38:03] he was trying every scheme that he had
[1:38:05] he was trying every battle tactic that
[1:38:07] he had what was he trying to do he was
[1:38:09] trying to give him a kingdom
[1:38:13] without a sacrifice
[1:38:15] he was trying him to make
[1:38:17] trying to make a way
[1:38:19] so he wouldn't have to suffer he was
[1:38:20] trying to make a way that he wouldn't
[1:38:22] have to suffer
[1:38:23] he was trying to offer a bloodless
[1:38:25] religion
[1:38:30] are you with me just for a moment
[1:38:34] brother ronnie this is my water
[1:38:37] thank you
[1:38:38] all right
[1:38:46] he was trying to talk to him
[1:38:48] over circumstances
[1:39:05] all right
[1:39:19] somebody give lord handclap praise
[1:39:26] satan you're gonna lose
[1:39:29] you're gonna lose
[1:39:31] what was he trying to get jesus to do is
[1:39:34] trying to talk himself out of who he
[1:39:36] really was and that's what he's gonna
[1:39:38] try to do to you is try to make you talk
[1:39:41] yourself out because you're not going to
[1:39:43] be able to do these things or he's
[1:39:44] trying to say well you're not strong
[1:39:45] enough or you're not big enough but i
[1:39:47] want you to know that god that's on the
[1:39:49] inside of you is big enough don't you
[1:39:51] ever start listening to the devil and
[1:39:53] don't you ever start talking the devil's
[1:39:55] language brother branham says it's
[1:39:56] strange this thing that is so much
[1:39:59] thought of people they say well i'm i'm
[1:40:00] weak my faith is not very much i'm i'm
[1:40:02] not a very good christian that's just
[1:40:04] what the devil wants you to say you're
[1:40:06] just talking the language then you're
[1:40:08] talking his language then you must never
[1:40:10] say that don't you never let your
[1:40:13] testimony be negative let it be positive
[1:40:15] all the time i am saved i have god in my
[1:40:19] heart i believe him with all of my heart
[1:40:21] do you believe in divine healing with
[1:40:23] all of my heart let your testimony
[1:40:26] always and your thoughts and everything
[1:40:28] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:40:30] into your mind if you can help it when
[1:40:33] it starts don't entertain it he was
[1:40:36] trying to get jesus to break the word of
[1:40:39] god he made moses break it he made eve
[1:40:42] break it but he met the wrong guy this
[1:40:44] time
[1:40:45] and satan lost right there and he had to
[1:40:48] go back where it came from and we are
[1:40:50] here to serve notice on the devil today
[1:40:53] we're not going to stoop down to you
[1:40:55] we're not going to listen to what you
[1:40:57] got to say
[1:40:58] you can try to offer us a religion
[1:41:00] without an experience you can try to
[1:41:02] offer us a religion without an atonement
[1:41:05] you can try to offer us religion as a
[1:41:07] form of form of godliness but we try to
[1:41:10] make us deny the power thereof and if
[1:41:13] you deny the power thereof god hates a
[1:41:16] powerless religion
[1:41:19] if you ain't got no blood in your
[1:41:20] sacrifice you have a powerless religion
[1:41:25] the devil don't mind you coming to
[1:41:26] church the devil don't mind you clapping
[1:41:28] your hands the devil don't mind you
[1:41:30] saying a prayer but when you begin to
[1:41:32] pray as a son of god
[1:41:35] you have power more power than any angel
[1:41:38] in heaven has more than lucifer himself
[1:41:41] has
[1:41:42] one man began to pray by the name of
[1:41:44] hezekiah he began to pray a prayer of
[1:41:47] faith and all of a sudden god came down
[1:41:50] and smote 185
[1:41:53] 000 assyrians by one prayer by one angel
[1:41:57] let me say this to you the living god
[1:42:00] the church of the living god that angel
[1:42:02] has not left
[1:42:05] that angel is here to make sure that you
[1:42:08] carry out the victory that angel is here
[1:42:10] to make sure that you win
[1:42:13] satan you lose
[1:42:17] he don't mind you coming here and
[1:42:18] clapping your hands he don't mind you
[1:42:20] even seeing it but when you begin to
[1:42:22] enter in
[1:42:23] when you begin to sing and set an
[1:42:25] atmosphere where the holy ghost says
[1:42:27] welcome he don't mind you sitting there
[1:42:29] crossing your arms but when you begin to
[1:42:31] enter in and say hey he's talking about
[1:42:33] me
[1:42:35] i'm the overcomer of that day i'm the
[1:42:38] one that's going to come out of laodicea
[1:42:42] i'm the one that's going to come out of
[1:42:43] laodicea
[1:42:44] you remember when jesus takes his
[1:42:46] disciples up there in matthew chapter 16
[1:42:49] and he takes them over there in the
[1:42:51] coast of caesarea philippi and he goes
[1:42:54] over there and they begin to ask them
[1:42:56] he said whom do men say that i the son
[1:42:59] of man am
[1:43:00] and they said well some say you're alice
[1:43:02] and some say john the baptist he said
[1:43:04] but who do you say that i am you see
[1:43:07] there's power in your testimony
[1:43:10] you see it's not just for your mama and
[1:43:12] daddy to say it it's not just for your
[1:43:15] pastor to say it i believe too many
[1:43:17] times we get the ideology of a bunch of
[1:43:19] catholics let's just let the preacher do
[1:43:21] it let's just let the worship leaders do
[1:43:23] it this is not about the worship leader
[1:43:26] this is not about me this is about you
[1:43:29] whom do you say that i the son of manham
[1:43:33] and there was one peter that said thou
[1:43:36] art the christ the son of the living god
[1:43:39] and he said peter upon this rock i will
[1:43:43] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:43:45] shall not prevail against it
[1:43:49] oh come on somebody the strongest part
[1:43:53] of hell will not be able to stand
[1:43:55] against it
[1:43:56] now i want you to notice
[1:43:57] where jesus takes them to he takes them
[1:44:00] over into caesarea philippi
[1:44:04] cisserie philippi
[1:44:08] is the gate to the underworld
[1:44:11] it is a place where demon worship is at
[1:44:14] its strongest
[1:44:16] and jesus ain't just passing by
[1:44:19] jews were not walking past caesarea
[1:44:21] philippi they didn't want nothing to do
[1:44:23] with it but here jesus takes his closest
[1:44:26] disciples right into the enemy's camps
[1:44:30] and he begins to ask them who do you say
[1:44:31] that i am
[1:44:33] if you can recognize that i am the son
[1:44:35] of god and i am building my church upon
[1:44:38] this revelation i am saying to you that
[1:44:41] laodicea won't overcome you caesarea
[1:44:44] philippi won't overcome you the gates of

[2:00:34] them all
[2:00:37] let's go ahead and have some victory
[2:00:38] here
[2:00:41] first samuel 11
[2:00:43] verse 1 then nahash the ammonite
[2:00:46] if you don't know where that's at
[2:00:48] it's right before second samuel
[2:00:54] first samuel 11 then nahas the ammonite
[2:00:57] came up against
[2:00:59] and encamped against jabez gilead and
[2:01:00] all the men of jabez said in the nahas
[2:01:02] make a covenant with us and we will
[2:01:04] serve thee
[2:01:06] and nahas the ammonite answered on this
[2:01:08] condition will i make a covenant with
[2:01:10] you that i may thrust out all your right
[2:01:12] eyes and lay it out for reproach upon
[2:01:15] all of israel
[2:01:16] and the elders of jabez said unto him
[2:01:18] give us seven days respite that we may
[2:01:21] send the messengers
[2:01:23] unto all the coast of israel and then if
[2:01:25] there be no man to save us we will come
[2:01:27] out to thee
[2:01:29] now now before you go on and you can go
[2:01:31] back and read out through that this
[2:01:33] whole whole chapter later but here the
[2:01:35] ammonites had had claimed the right of
[2:01:38] this uh original possession of gilead
[2:01:41] for some years and it had been 90 years
[2:01:43] since they had possession of it and
[2:01:46] because of jeff death over in the book
[2:01:48] of judges then when jet theft took it
[2:01:50] back
[2:01:51] here 90 years later the ammonites are
[2:01:54] coming back and they're wanting to renew
[2:01:56] their claims you see because of a broken
[2:02:00] covenant here
[2:02:01] here was the ammonites negotiating with
[2:02:04] the children of israel over their own
[2:02:06] property
[2:02:08] then nahash the ammonite came up and if
[2:02:11] you go to looking at the name of nahash
[2:02:14] if you go looking on the backside of his
[2:02:16] name his name means serpent
[2:02:19] he is the one and here he is preaching
[2:02:22] this same gospel and if you'll just
[2:02:24] surrender to me i i'll take your land
[2:02:28] man ain't that a stupid devil i'll take
[2:02:30] your land
[2:02:31] i'll take your joy if you just let me
[2:02:34] bore through your eye and and thrust
[2:02:36] through your right eye of all the men of
[2:02:38] jabez gilead
[2:02:40] and here this is crazy to me here the
[2:02:43] men of jabash gilead give them a week to
[2:02:47] think about it
[2:02:49] let me have a week to surrender let me
[2:02:51] have a week to think about this thing
[2:02:53] and i'm glad i'm glad that there was
[2:02:55] somebody that was that was out there in
[2:02:58] the land and all of a sudden they sent
[2:03:00] out all these men throughout throughout
[2:03:02] all the coasts of israel
[2:03:04] and there they went a weeping and they
[2:03:07] they went out wailing and crying about
[2:03:09] these things that here the ammonites are
[2:03:11] coming in they're wanting us to
[2:03:12] surrender they're wanting to thrust out
[2:03:14] the eyes of all of the soldiers of jabez
[2:03:18] gilead and all the israelites and here
[2:03:21] here he is he's bringing in his tactics
