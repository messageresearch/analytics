Vernon I've been I've been hearing him play the guitar since I was a little bitty fellow it's been a uh thank you amen makes a lot of difference uh but uh and uh it's it's always good to hear that uh takes me back when I just a little kid I just a little boy sitting on the front row and brother Vernon was playing the guitar and spirit of the Lord would follow in the church and you always know when it was really having church cuz Vernon he as he he he Clos he closed his eyes and I think how's he doing that but um the spirit of the Lord and it's real good to be here today and uh we have a few things on our heart but let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer and just a moment of reverence to him and if there's a special need on your heart today we know that he's still God and that through the foolishness of preaching he said that he would save and I believe that today that it's it's still important that we preach the gospel that we bow our hearts in his presence and ask him for his Mercy Heavenly Father we're we're your children Lord and because we've been birthed of the word Lord there's something in our heart that rings that this is the truth Lord we've sold to it we're Lock Stock and Barrel Lord You're our only hope we've not left something else to grasp to we've we've sold ourselves to you Lord we belong to you as your children we look to you Lord for our protection and our guidance and our leadership Lord we have determined that every sense that we have is wrong and only your word is right now father we we follow you Lord and we ask for your great anointing to come in this meeting this morning Lord and lead us but Lord You're the great General you're the one that's taught our Hands to War you teach us Lord how to overcome our enemies and you teach us how to say your word and Lord to see enemies drop at our feet now we ask you Lord this morning that may your anointing Lord may it come upon this word may you minister to the need of these young people to the elders Lord to the beginner and Lord to the finishers we ask you father that if there be any sick this morning may you touch them Lord them that are here present Lord those across the line some of them at home this morning Father we're asking you for your mercy Lord May a breath of healing blow across their paths this morning Lord the strength and the comfort and the Hope Lord it would come and father we're asking you now for you to take this word and use it Lord for thy Glory we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you this morning we want to turn into the scripture into the book of Ephesians um I've U been holding a thought here um milk honey and Giants in my personal studies uh it just some things that was real to me um but I I want to uh continue in this line of thought I'm I'm still in Daniel chap 11 the 32nd verse but I want to read from the book of Ephesians uh the people that know their God uh shall do great exploits they shall be strong they will know him the people and I'm I'm one who believes that that people is the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe that's the people that the ible was talking about in the book of Ephesians uh in the 11th verse Paul says here in Ephesians 1:11 he said in whom also we obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will let's back up and read the fourth and the fifth verse according as he hath chosen Us in him before the found foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now I'm going to ask this before we continue according as he now brother Bram asked this question who chose us he did amen and he ha chosen Us in him when did he choose before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having an you remember brother Brown actually uh starts cutting a little bit of a joke and when he reads this in the adoption he starts spelling it p r e d because he won't say it out loud because the legalists don't like this word so he just starts spelling it and he said I better quit fun it now and then so he he says the word predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen the predestination unto adopt amen we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated this morning uh I do believe uh that the church has a mountain I believe that there is a position the church has been promised um I believe that that promise that God has made to the church is our inheritance I I certainly believe that what God gives us I believe we're able to have it I believe that if God gives something to you that he is Sovereign and he has a right to give to you because he is Sovereign God Amen when I when I look at this this morning and I think about it and maybe we would say to ourselves what what mountain would the church be on today What place would we be on today um I can look at this in uh from the scripture now in Genesis chapter 22 as the children of Abraham if you go to Genesis chapter 22 and you uh remember now uh Abraham has had a promise of a son and uh this is the promised son Isaac uh who is only a type of Jesus Christ and he's he's waited for years for this son to come now as the sun begins to mature God at the end of Abraham's life uh calls him to go to a mountain and on that mountain he is supposed to sacrifice uh his only son Isaac uh he's supposed to give his life there the scripture tells us in Genesis 22 uh that it was about a 3-day Journey when Abraham come to the place of this mountain now this mountain uh that he went on of course uh we named uh Gracie after this mountain Mount Mariah uh I always thought it was a a beautiful name Mariah it was a mountain of Grace it's where God's grace came uh it was where God got the name Jehovah Gyra which is which is pretty powerful the name Jehovah Gyra I tell you one of the first times that I ever I went to India actually I went with brother uh Tony abma it was uh early on and brother Tony came by there in that little church in Arkansas and he was telling all about Mission work and I've been to South Africa and met the Indian people in South Africa and had preached for them I fell in love with them and and uh I was still working on the food a little but I but I I love the people and uh brother Tony said uh he said why don't you come go with us over to India and and I said well brother Tony I said we're we're poor people and and it's a small Church there's just no way I don't I don't have that kind of money he said well God provided if he's called you to travel and do it so I said well I tell you what if the Lord if the Lord provides it I'm going to go that's it I'm just going to go and so we we it was a Wednesday night and brother Tony came and he got up in front of the church and uh but just in the in the back uh I talked to him a little bit and something funny had happened right before church is Mariah I see now uh that would have been I was uh 30 30 31 years old so I don't remember how old Gracie was we Bethany had just been born so it was it she was about a year old so how about four years old maybe so Mariah comes in there and said dad I heard y'all talking about you going to India and I said yeah and she had a she had a I believe it was a dollar and she said to me she said Dad she said here I'm going to give you this to go to India and I never will forget it she gave me that dollar and um well when brother Tony in the back room I was laughing telling him about the a kid's mind thinking that a dollar would send you India you know and so I told him about the story well he comes out to the platform and tells the church the story and then when he did he reached in his pocket and pulled out $100 and he said here he said the dollar just become a hundred and then before we left the service that night of course then we were going to India uh the holy spirit amen um and I found out his name was Jehovah Gyra uh that if God wanted you to go he was able to provide the means for you to go and he can start with a dollar amen so don't you think that God can't take something very small and make it big amen uh so but but in this in this story it was on Mount Mariah here that Abraham took a Isaac and um of course it sounds a little more like an Easter message but uh but Abraham took Isaac and went up on the mountain he was to go there and make a human sacrifice now until this time the only sacrifice had been Lambs but here now is the first time the idea of human sacrifice would be put into the into the thought and it would be a human sacrifice would be Abraham's son and uh the scripture tells us that Abraham of course going to take Isaac up and and he's going to uh slay him on the mountain when he gets ready to go he takes Abraham some wood in the fire uh and he takes Isaac and he starts going up the mountain and the Bible says uh that as Abraham and Isaac are going up the mountain that Isaac says father here's the wood and here's the fire but where is the Lamb right so he he understands the order of worship would require a lamb amen but but God had so instituted it that Isaac was going to be the Lamb on that sacrifice of course that was a testament of Jesus Christ who was the Seed of Abraham who would come to replace the Lamb's sacrifice that it would be a human sacrifice now when they get up the mountain and Abraham being obedient the scripture tells us that he he ties up he ties up Isaac and I've always I've always thought brother Rams had his little chubby hands he put them out there and he tied them he said now of course he wasn't forcing Isaac Isaac was submitting to the will of Abraham to be sacrificed and I thought to myself I wonder uh what kind of story that a father would tell a son that a son would let him bind him knowing he's going to cut him but but there was something he was able to deliver unto Isaac that would raise Isaac's Faith to the same place that Abraham Faith was see Isaac and Abraham would have had the same understanding of the outcome of what was going to come from that mountain and and Abraham had already told his servants before they went up he said the boy and I are going up and the boy and I are going to return amen see brother Ram said see he knew even if he killed him on the altar that the god that had gave him would raise him up again and somehow he had preached the idea of Resurrection to Isaac amen and that that idea now the beautiful thing is is the the gospel that Isaac would have heard would have been a conglomeration of the stories that had happened from Abraham from the calling of Abraham until that day very day of the mountain had it happened any other time in the story Abraham couldn't have told the whole story of course it's a type of the end time message of how that the Church of the Living God in the end time is to receive the same Faith the same faith that Abraham received the church is going to have Abraham's Faith going to have Enoch's Faith going to have Jesus Faith but that faith will come from the Deliverance of a message that wholly tells the story of redemption from Eden all the way to the day we're living in see in in the age of Abraham he couldn't tell the stories of of of Joseph and he couldn't tell the stories of of Ezekiel and Malachi see it couldn't happen but now in this age we can tell tell every one of the stories from Adam's story to Abraham's story to Moses story to noses see to Noah to we can sit here and stay with David you can take every type in the scripture to show that this single thing is what God has had on his mind from the beginning see this is this is the only portion that has been in every story that was ever told in the scripture there's nothing else happening in history today that matches SE to show what God had on his mind the entire time and that what was going on on the mountain was God was showing Isaac by Abraham's testimony he he brought us out he met us when we were Barren God met us in the flesh he's changed our bodies he's gave you as a son don't worry if I have to take your life God will raise you up again and in that Obedience of the last trial of Abraham's life now you can hear sermons like uh possessing the enemy gate after the trial you can hear that brother Ram uses the story and you think why he waited all those years for a child and then he was tested on the child amen and think of this here the church has been waiting for all this time for a Vindicated word and now God test you on the Vindicated word itself other words it isn't just enough that we've received it now you've been tried to whether or not you're going to believe it in the face of every situation but of course you're going to believe it in the face of every situation but you only possess the gates after the trial so the message ain't on trial your faith is what's on trial amen but when your faith Amen correlates to the same Faith as Abraham's then you possess the Gate of your enemy now watch here because the scripture tells us amen that Abraham did not take the life of his son God prevented it and then when he prevented it Abraham heard a ram in the background and he turned and seen a ram hung by his horns in the thicket now there's types and all of that and it's not my point so I'm not going to preach it but but it's a beautiful it's a beautiful preaching but the realm itself brother Ram takes the RAM and he said I want you to notice something about the realm it's a he it's a ram it's a he Ram he said which testifies of the manifested word of God so you can look at this everybody all denominations can look and see that Jesus is in that story as Isaac but it took a prophet to show you the bride in the story as a ram now how do you when you see that it was a heam brother Ram says see of course there is Malachi the 4th chapter now who could have found Malachi 4 in Genesis 22 but a prophet he uncovers it by saying that it's a ram and then he turns to Genesis uh 15 and he shows Abraham's sacrifice of five animals the third animal in the sacrifice is a ram it's a it's a male but man said see here that the realm is a male it is a created it is a created realm it's God's spoken word Ram so he shows us then that the ram is the manifested word of God now now so that you can get it real clear he's using the realm to show you that the bride in the last day marries the word and not a church he said see if it was a she see what it would be then the Baptist would be joining with a shei church she would be joining with she the Methodist but he's showing you in Scripture that the bride will be marrying the manifested creative word of God in the last day so the mountain that we are on represents the mountain Abraham was on the mountain the bride is taking today is the mountain of the third pool which is Christ you see brother manam said the the third pole cannot be impersonated right he said Satan can do everything that Jesus could do but he can't be him see he can act like him but he can't be him the third pool is him see it's it's not acting it's not doing something like him it is him the third pole is Christ the manifested word in the last day so the Church of the Living God is on the mountain of manifesting him Christ the word that's the mountain they're on now to make that a little clearer to you Amen Let let's look at this and see the manifested word now you can take it from here and you can go to acts the 15th chapter and the 14th verse when the gospel first become to the Gentiles remember there was an argument among the Disciples of whether the Gentiles should be included somebody brought up the Old Testament Prophecy from The Book of Amos and then again said Simon had declared how God at the first had visit the Gentiles watch he visited them to take of them a people for his name you see what God visited the Gentiles for a purpose how many knows this has been the day of visitation that God has visited this Gentile age he made a visitation for the purpose of the calling out of the Bride a lot of people tell you the message is allow a lot of things it's not about building churches it's not about building Ministries it's not about about who's right and who's wrong God has visited this generation to take out a bride of every denomination for the purpose that there would be somebody who could marry to the manifested word of the age that we're living in in other words God visited here to get a bride for him amen amen there's a lot of people there's a lot of brides but he wanted one for watch his name isn't that beautiful his name that realm is a he amen that for a people for his name amen watch this next verse and to agree with the words of the prophets as it is written so it's Old Testament as it is written and after this will I return and build again the Tabernacle of David which is fallen down I will build again the ruins thereof I will set it up now I'm not going to preach on it the Tabernacle of David in short is a tabernacle of Praise built outside of tradition in the days when David built the Tabernacle praise the tent of Tabernacle he he made daily sacrifices sing daily daily shed the Bloods all the while Mosaic law was still in Tradition down in another place at the same time that the law was being worshiped by tradition David was worshiping under Revelation and praise in other words there would be two things in existence at the same time there would be a layot toy of church age and a bride age at the same time that will be a Pentecost caught in world tradition amen but there's been a seventh angel come to call the bride out of the tradition to the genuine atonement of the word of God we have heard the gospel trumpet sound to the church come out of her my people and be not partakers of her fornications amen but what is it when that when that church is built up again as a tabernacle of David not in Tradition but in Praise of almighty God Amen worshiping intense the word intense amen the word living intense I'm talking about a third pool church I'm talking about the word intense again among the Church of the Living God and the blood and the sacrifice being a daily ritual and the songs being a daily ritual not going once in a while to church to worship but a daily continual worship of the spirit of God living in the tent with the church oh my what a blessing to live in this house hour what a day amen pull that scripture back amen the scripture is talking about somebody pulled out amen somebody pulled out I will begin build again and I will set it up now if you wondering who's setting this up he just told you you wondering who's building this bride he just told you I'll build it I'll set it up I will build my church I'll set the thing up I'll design it I'll make it the way I want what's that next one he said that the residue of men we I preach this from the Old Testament it's powerful I don't have time to preach it it's just a a passing thought to you this morning amen but the residue of men might seek after the Lord my goodness that the residue of men that the lower part of men the rejects the oddballs the people that nobody else wanted I'll take that and build again the Tabernacle of David I'll take the people that everybody throwed out and I'll move into them with my word and make it a habit ation of the most holy God Amen the Angels cannot go where this residue can go amen the world cannot go where this residue could go but as the Bride of Jesus Christ he has put his name on the residue of men and took nobody's and made somebody's he took nothing to do something oh Church of the Living God God has took what nobody wanted and made something glorious out of it my he's a mighty God this morning and he saw us out of all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saeth the Lord who doeth all things amen now what we're looking at as we're looking at Prophecy of the scripture again it is written in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 7 I'm using this he the Bible said the mystery of iniquity doth work and will work amen it's already working who now leth will let that's God will let this happen until now that until is he he be taken out of the way there's two he's there he will let till he be taken out of the way he God will let until he the bride be taken out of the way that he is the bride so people said well how you identify her as a bride watch it in the negative in the church ages the Bible said the teachings of balam and then it said that woman Jezebel Amen brother man said watch how that Jezebel amen she became something by teachings it changes designation and so does the bride when she receives his name she's now identified with the not feminine but with the male name of Jesus Christ all of the heavens and earth amen testify that her is the name of Jesus Christ she carries the name then he will let until he be taken out of the way amen something has happened there has been a marriage there has been an identification of Christ into the Church of the Living God until a prophet was would say the seven seal brings him back to the Earth is that right and then he'll turn around and say she is him there has been an identification that when a prophet looked at you he said the church and God have now become one and he has identifying himself as a bride let's put it in another way God all that he was ped into Christ and all that's in Christ has been poured into the bride until now when God look looks at the bride he looks at his own power his own atonement his own work this is the bride is him she is him she walks in his power she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh authority of his authority oh my goodness amen I'm talking about something wonderful this morning the bride will know her mate the revealed word of the hour Daniel 11:32 the people shall know their God brother randam translates it to you and I the people will know their mate amen isn't that powerful the people will know their mate the revealed word is our mate that's why we're not going to back up from this message that's why you could give me 60 reasons brother Ram's wrong and I won't believe one of them amen you can give me all the reasons you want to I'm not believing one of them because it is my mate amen I have become one with it I don't I don't have another husband I don't have another idea I don't have another Choice there there's not either this or that amen this is all that to me it's my everything it's all that I am it's all that I ever hope to be I don't have another choice I don't have a backup plan amen if this is wrong we're in real trouble because I really believe it but it ain't wrong amen Heaven has witnessed to it amen the Earth has witnessed to it God has witnessed to it God has showed us beyond a shadow of doubt this is the Vindicated word of God in the age that you're living in my Lord somebody said well I never seen God do you see that's it's the translation of what you believe God is amen y'all remember what is God go listen to the message brother B takes it from the spirit into Christ into a bride amen one person in a prayer line said you ever want to see the face of God but just turn around and look you want to see the face of God God this morning now the veil is going to bother you don't let the veil bother you look at what's behind the veil Glory this is the unveiling of God not in Jesus not in Moses it's unveiled God in you if you would unzip the veil this morning behind the veil is a pillar of light that come off of almighty God that has cond descended into this age and by the power of the the blood has stepped into a human body It Now controls your destiny you don't believe God could write something and be wrong about what he wrote now now there's no it alls and then there's God he knows everything and can do something with what he knows right he's the only one that can put in power God what he thinks what he desires that pillar of light comes to design our destiny think about this the bride will know her mate now now if you want to maybe say this let's go to and see the bride will know her mate the revealed word improving his word now I'm just giving you a little little tidbits you write them down go look them up and then we'll read them later but but improving his word one of the greatest most powerful quotes I think you'll ever read brother B said the son of man has come into human flesh yes to join is that right to join to join the bride and Christ together that's what he was doing to join that's when he announces the marriage has already come now if you want to take time brother Reagan did a good time job on it I don't have time to preach on don't know if I have the ability to preach on the way he would but but he showed specifically how we move from bride to wife I really never had seen the the point in it personally I'll just be honest but but the other day today I was talking to somebody and they said well yeah they keep calling us bride but the way they're calling us bride is like somehow something might change between here and there but if you really want to be wordy and you want to get down to the revelation we are not just bride we actually have become wife you see this we're not bride in the sense that we're just a spouse we have become wife we literally have entered into relationship with Christ there there is one Spirit one strength one blood we have entered into being wife he brother R will now announce that the marriage has already come you got every right this morning Amen to to claim every right that a wife would claim of a husband you have a right to claim of almighty God it's the truth you say well brother Wayne what what kind of point would would have to come from this because with the moment brother brandham does this enjoins it he says something on the end of the quote and you look it up sometime they might find it before we're done with it but but he'll say it like this he says what will it do then if I'm going to join these two together what will it do then he said it will manifest the son of man again all most illegalist hate that one amen because you know of course that's only in a prophet right that's only something for a prophet but brother Brandon said when this bride recognizes and gets a hold of and joins together with it will manifest the son of man again amen again in other words not something new they will do it again amen they'll be a part of what God has did they will do it again I I'll show it to you in the Bible in John 12 verse 28 Jesus said unto the father father glorify my name and in the 28th verse the Bible said he said to him glorify thy name and there come a voice from heaven saying a voice from Heaven saying who knows what that voice from Heaven it was the Thunders come on it was the Thunder that's the way brother Ram explains the Thunders from this scripture it was a voice from Heaven seven Thunders uttered and said I have glorified it and I will glorify it again then it's not us glorifying ourselves it's not us making something of ourselves this is God glorifying the bride by bringing the word of all the ages in I want you to see something all the ages desire to see or to read what you are now living you're not just reading it you're not just talking about it you're not just hearing the preaching of it you are the very thing that God has hid in his mind from the foundations of The World God has glorified the residue of men by the pillar of light that has come upon the church I can show you that a pillar of fire brother random said his name now identified and adopted Sons and Daughters of God the pillar of fire is not in heaven the pillar of fire is not over a grave somewhere the pillar of fire is not hanging in brandom Tabernacle the pillar of fire is over the word of the bride and this age manifested Glory manifested power the light and the power and the faith of almighty God it's our origin it's our destiny it's our life he said I will glorify again Hallelujah glory to God yeah it's something to shout about all the ages long to see it all the ages desire and you are what they only look to see my goodness I feel like speaking in another language I'd use it if it would help me to glorify again to Glory with the glory you had before the world began you may not you're just a little snowbody and you think so small of yourself but do you know you had Glory with God before the world ever began the inspiration for God to create a world was you the inspiration for God to created Eden was you the inspiration that God had in all the creation that was a motive behind it all it was a bride to share in the atoning power my I I want you I want you to understand something a man does something he builds a house he builds a certain way he does a certain thing motives are behind that usually a woman's behind that all the brothers is saying amen you know it's right many of you like me you live in a on the side of the river if it's up to you a concrete one so I wouldn't have to paint it that's the truth you don't think it's truth that as my father-in-law he worried that I wasn't going to buy a house you got wonder what's he going to do with my daughter good thing he trusted the Lord it's the truth got to trust the Lord he takes care of things glorify again yes sir it's it's amazing the word again it's again written in Revelation chapter 10 so well-placed behind the seventh Angels message John is told to eat the book to Devour the book and that the word would be in his mouth so then he said because thou have eaten because of the word that's in your mouth you must prophesy again look what he said he said thou must prophesy again let me tell you you ever eat this message and they can't shut you up it it will it's going to come out of you you can't help it it's going to come out of you it's it's a must amen amen do you see that must prophesy and I just love it again again now now I'm going to I y'all wearing your seat belts a prophet said it like this he said it he said it very clearly you say what I said on those tapes that's good ain't it now not only am I confined to the tapes but I'm commanded to speak what's on the tapes that goes two ways don't it cuz some of the things on the tape I found out the people that said say what brother Bram said did did not want me saying what brother Bram said cuz on the same tape he said say what I say if you go on and follow on you'll say he'll come through and say the bride will manifest the son of man again the bride is the the literal Life of Christ the bride is one but see these these things like he says like this like what what about this one where he says the voice is in the bride we can can we say that one the voice is in the the bride is that right if the voice is in the bride now now hold your shock Factor but this is the truth that's what the spirit was speaking on the wings of a snow white dove when brother Ram screamed out in the spirit and said I will ride this Trail again I will ride it again what's he talking about brother Ram's not talking about bringing a t and traveling across America flying in an airplane and setting up meetings and people attending his meetings he's talking about the words that I have prophesied was not my own but they're now embodied into a church AB bride a many member body and they'll live the bride will live and then lay out to see and age she'll turn it in to a bride manifestation of almighty God I'll ride the trail again now if you if you don't if you don't think if you think brother Ram was talking about himself Jesus had the same problem when he cried from the cross because he said it he said I thirst I thirst it was the words that David spoke from Psalms 22 when he spoke it brother man said it wasn't David speaking it was Christ speaking through David I thirst and the same cry spoke through a come on he's either a prophet or he ain't well you say he's a prophet then he's a mute then he's a mute and it wasn't him speaking come on now the the arguers of the these cases will argue with I'm talking about Giants friends the Giants in these cases will argue brother Brandon was a prophet and the only one that could speak the word he was the only one that could have this ministry he's the only one that could be this and I certainly agree but when the man with the ministry amen opened up his vessel and the God that he was serving poured out an anointing for a bride to follow after him with the words that he has spoken that I'm not standing here building a platform for myself but a proph has stood before us and laid a platform of the spoken word upon the Church of the Living God Amen and here she stands I'll ride this Trail again can I say it better I'll ride this Trail again say what I said again say what I said again I know some people won't like my interpretation of that but that's okay I don't believe it's mine I believe that was the true intent of the statement my goodness now let let's just do it for the sake of this saying this if somebody else took that statement I'll ride this Trail again and beat built doctrines that held the truth out of bride manifestation what kind of devil would try to hold you out of the treasures of letting the word live through you and manifesting what the scripture spoke of you it is a wrong interpretation of scripture that cuts it off from the church but a true interpretation will throw the doors wide open and every person sitting here even the residue even the smallest child will say to themselves I can walk into that I can step into that realm I can walk where God walks come on not everybody in here is going to speak squirrels I'm with you but the potential to do so is laying on the inside of every believer in the church am man it's not that you have to go around speaking to everything around you but there's a potential that lays into you and that potential in the right place at the right time God could use you for whatever he desires to use you I think it's time to take the limits off of God now brother maram calls of the final voice the voice of the message can I say it like this the Alpha has become the Omega in 1 Thessalonians 4 we are not identified as the shout we are identified as the bride we have been moved from just loud to sin to being the voice of the Bride the third pull is in the bride glory to God I I think a statement like that has to be backed up the third pull is in the bride let me let me help you let me help you bring it um uh let's help the entrance of that thought let's do it like this the word is in the bride how's that spoken word original SE pick up your pen and write brother Ram picked up the pen and wrote it and then he read the quote of an angel from the pulpit which tells me that the bride has the right to read the quotes of an angel from the pulpit is that right then the word is in the bride Let Me Go a step further he said she'll know what he wants done with the word amen he said she'll have thus saith the Lord woo I tell people say all times brother way Ain't nobody got thus sayith the Lord but a prophet I agree but we've had a prophet we've had a prophet and that Prophet gave us thus sayth the Lord now the church sits here with their mind fixed upon thus sayith the Lord we're not a people Carried Away by every wind of Doctrine we are grounded and settled in the revelation of the adoption of the church in the last day with all authority with all power with all the anointing that God has placed within the church then the word is in the bride the third pool p is the opening of the word and on one's end time third p is the open of the word he says it like this or the opening of Seven Seals what was opened in the Seven Seals is not only in the seven seal book it is now in the bride so if the third pull is the opening of The Seven Seals and that comes in you the third pull is in the Bride Can I can I give you this one the third pull is to the total LW that's good isn't it it's two the total lost he said but it's for the bride who's it for then who's the third pull for it's for the bride the third pole is for the bride now according to Paul in Ephesians chapter one then we are predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ then our adoption is our predestination God ordained us to this specific time and age according to Romans the 8th chapter we have been elected and ordained and called unto be conformed unto the image of his son now short the image of his son speaks of the glory amen the seed put in the ground starts growing again there's there's a husk and there's a stock and and there's stages of it but all those stages are not the glory of the Original Seed but when you pass the seed back to seed again you're moving from glory to glory or from image back to image again is that right then the church is not ordained to Shu they're ordained to the original image that was in the mind of God I tell you it's a powerful thing when you see it when you see that Abraham's son come through Mary it's a powerful thing when you see it that the seed amen has to come through Pentecost but Pentecost was not the seed now the word was in The Bride it will be for the bride the predestination is to adoption let's get this point election chose you predestination tells you of your destiny predestination gives you your destiny I love that predestination giving to Destiny I want to maybe say this to you the Bible said my people are destroyed by a lack of knowledge that's why they're destroyed that's why the Bible said without a vision we perish it's because without a lack of knowledge now that knowledge that we need amen is the knowledge of what God thought of us that's why Paul said we should pray for knowledge and wisdom and understanding amen do do you see then the very Destiny and origin of the church as Sons without the knowledge of what God has did to redeem you as a son then Satan can prevent you from your Destiny without the knowledge of the word of God Satan can hold you out of your destiny God has Destiny for you to be in the adoption of the church now your destiny speaks of your origin let me just say like this you can't go back to something you was not and Redemption speaks of going back you're not becoming something you wasn't you're going back to what you were is that right amen now watch this if we go into the scripture in Genesis the first chapter let's see the origin of man himself when the human was born in Genesis chapter 1 amen I I don't remember how many times it's multiple times maybe 30 something times within a Sho a few short verses that God has Abraham or Moses writing the Genesis and when he does he uses the word god which is the Hebrew word Elohim Amen brother Ram is very strong on the point that Elohim is self-existent if you take Elohim the the Theologian says it's plural brother bam says if of course not plural in personality but he explains to us that God was plural in attribute is that right then the plurality was attribute or potential that was in God but it took something to open up the attribute or the potential in him was to be a son or to have sons or to redeem Sons but it wasn't until he created man that God took on this attribute when you go from Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 you go in Genesis 2: 7 and you see a change Genesis 2:7 says instead of saying God it uses the word the Lord God formed from the dust of the earth when you use the word Lord God brother brandom says the word which means in Hebrew the self-existence all by himself that's what Elohim means God all by himself existed he was all existence therefore he was self-existent when Elohim means all sufficient he said all powerful allmighty self-existent one but in Genesis 2 when he made a man he said I am Jehovah what did it mean it meant the all existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one Jehovah means the word Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God he made man an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with a family he is Elohim now he is Jehovah meaning the one who exists with a family the one who existed with a family God created for all those days amen but he had nothing like him until he created Adam and when Adam was created God reached perfection in his creation because he had brought himself back into the Earth amen now I I want you to maybe to just stay with me just for a moment in this thought because what we're looking at is is there has a predestination over your life of where you you come from you go back to now think about this because brother brandham is going to say this he's going to say see then we go back to the same Elohim were he self-existent then we come back through Jehovah who me who made something he gave dominion over the Earth and what are we waiting for the manifestations the Earth is groaning let go down and read it predestinated unto the adoption of children to the good pleasure to the praise and the glory of his grace what is Grace back before when he wasn't a father his grace is love he made himself a child that he might be predestinated unto adoption to the praise of his grace where is accepted in the blood which is Christ made us accepted how how do we get into him by one Spirit baptized into him in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins now now brother Ram says something here that is just staggering to me how can you preach predestination of God for ordaining and setting unless there's a sin atonement somewhere how can I say that you're going to be somewhere without providing the vehicle to get you there if you're born in sin and shaped into iniquity and I'm prophesying that you're going to return to Dominion ship how could I do that without offering something to get you to where I'm saying you're going to go evidently that you cannot do that or you wouldn't need the Jehovah Gyra but if God has said you would be there God will provide the means to get you there then when you read here brother bam said then we need an atonement now the word atonement is a very powerful word and it would take us a long time to go into it but do can we go into it just a little bit into the word atonement which it's an English word that means it's three words put together at one me so atonement means at one like it was meant atonement it's at one meant now now William tendale is the author of this word it's an English word that was not even in existence until about 15 or 1600 William tendel lived in a time when the Latin was the really the only language that the Bible was preached in the Greek and Hebrew had been translated to Latin and the Romans were using Latin to preach to the church now their translation of the Greek and Hebrew would include words like Roman the Holy Roman Catholic Church they would include words of repentance rather than repentance they would use words like Ecclesiastes instead of church or congregation they they had words amen that would put priests in the place of clergy or Elder amen so what they would do is the words they were using brought the church under the authority of their church instead of the word of God so their translations had direction to it amen and only the priest could read it so the common people could only hear the word through the Latin and one day somebody was talking to William tendale and they said they actually said we would be better off without God's law than the popes and at that time when tendale answered he heard that and he said listen I defy the pope and all of his laws and said if God would spare my life here many years I will cause a boy that driveth a plow shall know more of the scripture than he does it was tend Del's intention that the common man would know more scripture than the pope himself because any person knows the only way to fight amen against the Antichrist is by the word of God Amen so it had to be in a language people could understand so rather than translating it from the Latin to the English Tindale took it from the Greek and Hebrew which he understood Greek and Hebrew and German and he was a he was in a line with Martin Luther so Luther was feeding him ideas can you imagine amen that Luther was giving Tindale ideas of what real atonement was meaning and how that it didn't include the church at all amen and tendale come up with the word atonement because he had no way to put together the idea of what God was doing through the blood of a sacrifice that translated to the blood of Jesus and it would need a word so he used the word at one meant and it became atonement to the to the to the to the world or to us this morning we received the English language of atonement through a man William tendale and I'll say this can you think about this the word of God in your language I don't know if you've ever thought about this but when God speaks nobody could even hear him but when a prophet caught the thought of God and spoke it he spoke it in Aramaic he spoke it in Hebrew he spoke it in Greek but he never spoke it in English but then God translates it to English through Tindale gives us the word of atonement and then here comes a gentile prophet in the end of the age to confirm that the translation that was given us into English was thus sayith the Lord that we're not here with just the ideas of an interpreter like William tendale but we found out that was God giving tendale the interpretation that then a Prophet would take a hold of it and say what atonement means is more than a word he exposed atonement through the manifestation of the word that was given so we then have the language of atonement amen do you know the Roman Church killed killed tendale for that they they killed tendale for it last words he prayed Lord Open the Eyes of the king of England amen do you see what tend Del's first use use of the word the of the word atonement is in 1526 in translation of the New Testament so it's not until 1500s the word of atonement so the language of atonement if you say the language of atonement you're talking about escapegoat the word scapegoat come from tendale the word Passover came from tendale the word atonement came from pendel because he was giving us the language of atonement to express what the scriptures were trying to say in the English language so the language of atonement would translate to the to the bride of Christ for the purpose of preaching atonement it see you can't preach something till it's in your language you can't say it until it's understandable but when God gave this translation he was making the preaching of the atonement come into our language now in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and you go to the 18th verse here's another beautiful point that the translations they now they covered up tend Dales in the King James but originally when tendale did this one it was written like this all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation those two words reconciled and Reconciliation existed in tendil as atonement so instead of saying the ministry of reconciliation he said the preaching of the atonement can you imagine that God through Christ was atoning us to himself that's what God was doing through Jesus Jesus's job was to atone us to him through God and then he in turn gave us the preaching of that atonement that we could join others unto God so the preaching of the atonement now this atonement that we're talking about amen is found in Hebrews chapter 9 and the 12th verse amen having obtained an eternal Redemption for us the Deliverance that brought us a blood shedding the price has been paid amen see what it is it's a Deliverance that is brought by a blood shedding amen can you think about this now preaching atonement means a Deliverance was brought to us by Blood shedding that's the doctrine of atonement the shedding of blood brought Deliverance the shedding of blood brought our freedom the shedding of blood bought our at one back with God or reconciliation it obtained an eternal Redemption he said not just from one place to another Eternal Redemption he said that's Eternal amen and he went to Ephesians 4 and said sealed until the day of redemption according to scripture in 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 18 Again tendale uses the same word atonement amen here and watch what he says for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things of silver and gold your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers the word redeemed is the word atoned or the word ransomed you were not ransomed now in the Old Testament uh y'all know that that the firstborn had a ransom to pay they had to count the heads of of the of the of the young men I believe everybody over the age of 18 and remember they bring them to a high priest and he would evaluate or estimate the price of the soul and then you would have to pay into the sanctuary amount of so or silver for The Ransom of that Soul Peter knew the tradition that Moses had instated that you paid the money for The Ransom of the soul but when Peter was preaching in the New Testament he said this is not through silver and gold but you are ransomed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ so Peter was preaching atonement to the church not Redemption through money not Redemption through lamb but Redemption Through Blood he was preaching atonement now it's amazing because atonement don't only mean to bring back it also uses the Hebrew word CER which actually means to cover over now brother B brings this one out in the message of the Ark in Genesis chapter 6 and verse1 14 amen the scripture when God is telling Abra or Noah how to build the ark he said make thee an ark of goph for wood rooms thou shal make in the ark and thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitch Thou shalt pitch it the word in Hebrew is caer amen it's it it's it's it's it's actually meaning is to cover the wood amen this word is to atone brother B said what they used is a word pitch but but it really means to atone now the word atone means to cover over hey you remember brother Bram said they cut down the the the gopher wood which was easily soaked in things right he said they cut down the gopher wood but then God by wisdom told him to pitch it or to cover it that this wood would need a covering speaking of humanity as trees that we would need a covering so we wouldn't soak in the devil but we could resist the judgments that come upon the Earth is that right to atone the wood to cover the wood you had to cut down a tree take the life the sap out of the tree it went through a process that through the heat then the sap was reapplied to the wood of Noah and brother Bram said encased it like steel it was covered he said to act as a covering from the Judgment Waters so it was there it's not only for Redemption but atonement also speaks of covering I hope you're hearing me now so it's what was typed in Noah as a covering that the Bible is preaching the blood is not only redeeming you back to God he is covering you from the judgments of God so it would be one thing to be redeemed back but then you'd still be you you still got mistakes and trials and problems and issues you got all these things going on but the preaching of the atonement will tell you that the same blood that brings you back to God it's the same blood that covers you in the presence of God so as that you are encased in the steel of God Amen I I tell you there's another type brother ROM uses from the message the ark and he comes in he says watching how Moses went into the ark and he build in the holies of holies he built a Ark of the Covenant out of it was Cas of wood I believe it was and he buildt it out of wood but he overlaid it with gold so deity covered the wood deity covered the wood so the blood that would cover the church would not just be the blood of a human the church is not covered by human blood the church is covered by deity by the blood of almighty God my who could touch that kind of blood who could come into that kind of place who could see past that kind of blood now in Leviticus 16 the day of atonement from the language of atonement let's just take the day of atonement it would happen on the 10th day in the seventh month let that and settle in a minute I'm talking too fast you're missing the points the I know you did Brother Ray quick the 10th day in the seventh month anybody else Tyler got it the 10th day in the seventh month was the day of atonement remember the day of atonement that they would go and take two goats and they would kill one goat and take the blood of that Goat as an atonement for the sin of the people but then they had a second action that they would take that blood and put it on a living goat and then the living goat would carry the sins of Israel of that whole year and would pack it out in the wilderness so brother bandam says see two goats both represented Christ for years I couldn't get that why it took two goats but see goats can't resurrect themselves so it took a goat to die for the blood to shed the blood for our sins but it took another goat to represent that the sins were carried away so the shedding of the blood Carried Away The Sins of Israel it didn't just C the blood of the sins it Carried Away The Sins do you see God redeems you by the blood God covers you by the blood and then God takes the sins away it's not just an atonement where like okay amen God gives us atonement then we got to fend for ourselves the rest of our life but the atonement he gave us it paid the price of our Ransom it covered us with power and then it carried away our sins as the Bible said as far as the the East is from the West I tell you that's pretty far the east from the West that's how far that God carried your sins so everybody Amen in the denominational World likes to say this scapegoat was the devil that God put the sins on the devil the devil carried man said absolutely not he said the devil would carry them out and turn around and bring them back he said he's an ending Giver he would trade on you he'd take them he'd carry them then he' bring them back he said but when Jesus took your sins when Jesus takes the sins of the church they are taken away and they can never return back to the church could you imagine this that God could take something out of your life and it will never return again say oh preacher the what in the world happened to it I I think it's a powerful question that the goat could carry Away The Sins that the day of atonement that it could carry it away now here's the powerful thing this day of atonement on the 10th day in the seventh month amen it fell every year but every seven years was a Sabbath still atonement and every seven seven years were 49 years and the next year after 49 the day of atonement become a jubilee trumpet atonement so on the 10th day in the seventh month on the 50th day of atonement that atonement was a jubilee atonement and they would take the sounds of a trumpet and blow throughout the land that this atonement don't only cover it don't only take you away but it gives you back everything that you have lost over the last 50 years do you see all of the different festivals they had around the atonement was only speaking of that one power of the blood it would cover it would scatter sin it would give back the church everything that he had lost in the Years of Slavery and sin I tell you this at Rams Horn they blew amen was was actually blew on the day of atonement which was a jubilee trumpet and under that trumpet it actually spoke the trumpet said something the sound of the trumpet meant that you could return now I'm going to preach on the Jubilee I want to get in your mind the Jubilee was what they would restore or return back to everything that had been lost do you see church I'm not saying that the bride of Christ is going to possess something that belongs to somebody else I'm saying that you're not taking something of brother Brams or Moses's or Paul's or James or John's I'm saying God from the beginning intended for you to possess this land from the beginning it was in God's mind to take you the destitute the residue the lower parts and to lift them to the place that they could possess this land and God would do it by the power of an atonement to show the world my atonement is more powerful my goodness come on I'm not I'm not on a I'm not on a the wild goose chase I want you to see it this was a day of a year of 50 years and they could return sounded by a Rams Horn the Rams Horn had no voice of its own it was a wind instrument amen and it was a ram it was a ram are you with me Genesis 22 that was a ram it was a Ram's Horn that was hung in a Thicket and here we are on the day of atonement with a Rams Horn saying to the church that everything that you've lost has have been restored and people say how can we go back home theyd say there's been an atonement made you didn't see the atonement you didn't see the blood you didn't see the cross you wasn't standing there when the high priest did it but you heard the sound of the atonement through the horn and that was the same as seeing the blood my Lord when you hear the gospel in the last Church age this is the Ram's Horn the manifested word of God God is now saying to the church that all that we have lost all that has been taken away God has come to restore to the church by virtue of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ it won't be because you earned it it won't be because you're a good boy it won't be because you're better than somebody else this will be because God before the world ever began ordained you to prophesy over this age by the spirit of God my come on Church y'all know you know there's a transition you you Bible students probably and I've preached it a couple times I don't want to get I don't want to get over booking on this point but but Jesus said in Luke 4 for the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord the day of atonement on the 50th year was the acceptable day and Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is on me to preach this from the day before that in all other days atonement was announced by the sounding of Ram's Horn but now the manifested word of Isaiah 7 Isaiah 9 Genesis 3 was now preaching the word of redemption to the church and it was a jubilee so from that day forward the Jubilee would not be announced by Ram's horns it would be announced by gospel preaching I tell you if I was a devil I'd try to keep keep you from preaching too sure I'd try to get all the preachers disappointed all them to sit down quit studying the message quit reading the books I do my best because listen if a preacher that's got a gift in his life gets to studying this message you won't shut him up because it's the 10th day of the seventh month and we're sounding under the seventh Angel's message and it's not just the trumpet has blew but it's blowing again through pastors and teachers and evangelists and apostles and they're sounding Out a sound what's the sound church that the bride has been redeemed and atoned by the blood of Jesus Christ my you'll never get this possession by your abilities it's what God did for you I tell you brother bam said in the 10 virgins he said this the trumpet sounded and you can go free it's the grace of God it's the Jubilee the completion of the day of sin is over I tell you everyone serving T sin tape or visible audience everyone that serving sin the day of sin is over that's one of my favorite quotes I'm sure you heard it more than once the day of sin is over so the seven seal does end all things amen you see what in the mind of God he was having the blood atonement all the time that was always his plan but in the symbol of a lamb it was so weak they had to do it every year the weakness of the symbol was an every year atonement they had to keep doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it but it was in weakness they were doing it it would not take away sin it was only a type somebody was going to do it but in the weakness of that atonement Moses created flies and freeze and frogs in the weakness of that atonement Joshua stopped the son oh God church if them men had that kind of power under the weakness of the atonement of an animal what about the Church of the Living God under the precious blood of Jesus Christ which is not the blood of a man it's the blood of God I know Satan's trying to keep you through it from it but the preaching of the word of God would tell you that we have a high priest this morning that's not offering the blood of bulls and goats he's not entering into Moses's Tabernacle he's not going every year but the Bible tells us that Paul told us this that our high priest is meaned and he entered into the heavens of Heavens to atone by the blood of Jesus one time for everybody so I me tell you this the atonement is not going to be done again it's not going to be another shedding of the blood it's not going to be another sacrifice given on your behalf whatever God did it's did whatever God did it's already done the only thing left for the church is by the preaching of the atoning word and it would open up an entrance to every believer to believe that the grace of God has covered us that the power of God has set us at Liberty to restore us back to everything that has been lost I'll tell you this amen I I was reading here yesterday the day before and this this kept coming into me I don't know I I I can't I can't figure out if it's something from my distant memory or if it's something the Lord is speaking to me but I could just hear something saying to me but this blood but this blood but this blood and I keep thinking but this blood do you see what happened Jesus the Bible said but this man Jesus this man not any high priest this man with this Blood amen it's a special man with a special blood this Blood this blood is A different kind of blood this blood is not the blood of your fathers or the blood of bulls or blood of goats it is the blood of God that was shed to atone the church back to everything that was lost this Blood this Blood was put forth once and for all in Revelation chap 1 and verse 5 it is spoken said that unto him that loved us washed us from our sins in his own blood my goodness in his own blood the word wash actually means the word loosed he loosed us from our sins by his own blood I tell you people say to me all times Well when you getting pretty loose well if you start reading what I'm reading you'll get pretty loose too CU what you're going to find out is there's nothing holding you you're going to find out that's why they call this the astronaut Age We Have Nothing holding us we have no sins no bondage no degrees no dogmas no Creeds no problems we have been blasted into a bright age by a bright manifestation an astronaut age an eagle age of people and have Cut Loose they have Cut Loose God cut them loose that they can believe for the impossible you said preacher how loose are you let me tell you what brother brandom said he said consider this that it's the blood of God and it's a perfect blood now you consider that it's a blood of God and it's a perfect blood he said then the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and it is complete then you're sitting here this morning wanting to be free from something and I can tell you you're already loose from it I can tell you it's already complete it's already a finished work you don't need loose you need to hear the preaching of the atoning power of the blood of Jesus Christ that'll set a man at Liberty who was bound in Che in Chains of misunderstandings I'll tell you what amen I'll tell you this there is a blood this morning there is a power this morning that can loose a man and when he's loosed he is perfectly loosed for who the son is set free he is free not just a little free he's all the way free he's totally free he's totally delivered that was totally the blood of God so we're totally free this morning to believe every promise that God has made upon the church this man Jesus was not an ordinary man come on that baby of Mary was not an ordinary baby you can walk up to about anybody and ask them the question why the Virgin birth almost nobody in denomination world could tell you why the Virgin birth they honestly can't I asked some people just walked up in the Starbucks and said why the Virgin birth one lady said well it's in it's because I believe the word another woman said well I don't know I just believe it in my heart and I thought you mean to tell me that's as substantial of an argument you have with a devil that's that's as far as your argument goes with the devil but let me tell you what the Bible said that that the children of God were living perfect in heaven and Satan entered in and by reason he pulled them out of perfection into sin and when God heard about it when the Angels told God your children have failed brother BR said God run through didn't send an angel he said he ran through himself hunting his Lost Child crying Adam Adam he said a crisis had to have a conference and in the Eden conference God had to make a quick decision he said that would be an eternal decision he said we're going to use the blood he said and then he took the skins of those sheep and wrapped Adam and Eve in those sheep skins remember and when he wrapped them he atoned them or covered them from the Judgment of God and then prophesy God then he prophesied over them bloody sheep skins and he said the woman's seed and the serpent seed shall be enity between thy seeds for the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent brother let me tell you when this Bible begin to prophesy amen there was a serpent seed that was trying to destroy you trying to take your position he was trying to destroy your lives but Jesus the woman's seed was sent to undo everything the devil did who would have knew that that little baby would be the one that would stop the head of the devil he would actually bruise the head of serpents and bring them into the great subjection of almighty God my when I think about this then therefore that woman seed it's spoken over there in Jeremiah that a woman shall Compass about a man am sure Pentecost do use that for women preachers it was prophesied that a woman would have a child without a man that there would come into the Earth a new thing come on now you know in the Book of Matthew when they Angel met her said thou shallal conceive and have a child for a virgin shall conceive is that right a virgin shall conceive don't have time to go into it a virgin shall conceive and and watch the Catholics get a hold of that Doctrine and call it Immaculate Conception you got to be careful what you agree with because what they believe is they believe that Mary conceived of the Holy Ghost same way as you but they believe it was the blood of God but they believe that the egg come from Mary and they also believe to do that Mary had to be virgin born so the Immaculate Conception includes Mary as virgin born then you can see brother bram's teaching on seed not air with the shook showing you that Abraham's seed was not Ishmael Isaac but it was Jesus he said do you see it then do you see that Ishmael was a slightly doubted promise do you see that Sarah had the baby by promise but by sex but when Mary had the baby she had Abraham's baby without sex by promise come on Church Mary had Eve's baby Mary had Abraham's baby it was Christ Our Lord that came into the womb it was both male and female God created into that womb the egg and the sperm amen and God so created the body you don't think God don't know what he's doing before you ever fail before the fall in the in the garden Eve was already created was she not come on now I'm I'm not a doctor but I I pray that I've got this close enough to get past the doctors in the building but do you know that the the blood the blood of a woman does not mix with the blood of her baby if it does there's some major trouble going on it's it's a it's a tragic thing if it starts mixing but God designed that a woman could carry a baby without its Bloods mixing together because God knew that he would use the womb of a woman to bring his own blood into the Earth that God could bypass humanity and bring the blood upon the Earth to destroy sin God set this up so as you would be the blood of God in the last come on Church Mary was Pentecost you are the Virgin word come on justification was slightly down and sanctification what about the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother man said but Mary represented the husk but out of the husk come a seed out of there came a virgin word and we bypassed the entire church then Pentecost could carry you without mixing its life with your life and you could take God's life and come out of this age oh we're going to get into something right here right now couple minutes we're going to go don't don't get too don't get too excited in case there was no male the life in this Blood had to come from God alone and he created this blo blood cell in the womb of Mary God himself the Creator himself created a blood cell he created both egg and blood that was God creating an atonement there was nothing that could eradicate sin that could destroy sin that could remove it that could cover the church that could put you back so God created something that could that's the scripture I'm bypassing hundreds of scriptures y'all forgive me I'm just giving you the point the investment in Chicago brother Ram said it like this but God in his creative created a blood cell without sexual desire in the womb of the Virgin that don't only cover sin it omits it it takes it so far till it's not even in the mind of God again it don't make a bridge across the chasm it moves the chasm this drop of ink into a bottle of bleach whatever it might be you will never find that color again you drop BL your sins into the powerful creative blood of Jesus Christ the preaching of atonement tells me that it's the only place you can put sin that it can never come back [Music] again I was thinking about it this morning what happens to it when you put it if you put it under the blood what happens to it young people I hope you're listening to me real close what happens to it after you put it under the blood the prophet said it omits it it takes it away the preaching of atonement says to us there is a place that you can confess your sin and it will never return to you again that it will never come back up again do you know that you can confess your sin to Jesus Christ and he said he is faithful and just to forgive you confess sin dropped into the blood there is now no more remembrance of that sin you get in trouble you're wondering what to do with it I can tell you bring it under the blood you're wondering how can I live the rest of my life with what I did bringing under the blood you can bring it under the blood and God forgets about it amen God hides it from his own presence he obliterated he covered it he sets you back by it what is it it's the coloring he said the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators now watch this and down through time until it hits the accuser so what happens to it when you good now brother R shows us in the scapegoat that Jesus carries the sin away but where does he carry to what happens to it brother Bram said he knows the originator of it so it goes back to the original before it ever came to you it goes back to the head of Satan our accuser so the blood has the power for Jesus to take the sin off of your life and make the devil pay for that sin in the fiery tribulations of the Lake of Fire I tell you God annihilates Satan he annihilates sin sin is done away with because the bride will live in Eternal Redemption under the power of the atonement we got just a few minutes of patience this morning what happens to it he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm now somebody somebody here this morning needs to hear these quotes I assure you I'm not reading them just to read them there's no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he's free just that Clorox or the ink that can never be ink no more because it's been broke up and set back again when confessed sin is dipped in a man or a woman that's been dipped into the blood of Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil laid on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be throwed into the lake a fire my goodness the chasm bridged and can never come into remembrance again brother Wayne it's simple brother Bram said don't you stumble over Simplicity if the blood of bulls and goats are used for a bleach which can only cover but put a man in position to speak a creative word why would you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ's blood who could speak a squirrel or something into to existence don't stumble over Simplicity God hiding himself in Simplicity remember the blood of Jesus Christ takes sin so far from you until it's not in the remembrance of God anymore preacher what are you doing it's the preaching of the atonement I sat and read these quotes in my study and every time I read one I felt myself get lighter I thought you know what I've read these quotes but it's been a while and every time I read one I got lighter I felt lighter I felt I felt Freer the blood stands between God and me I accept it I'm a sinner but he's God but the Ministry stands between me the kill of sin so God sees me just as white see it's it's in the bleach sin is gone it can't even reach him because there's a sacrifice laying there now can you imagine the next time that you feel empowered of God to do something for the Lord and Satan begins to accuse you you if you remember the knowledge of this word right here look at what you could say to Satan he can't even see it Satan can you imagine you're perfected in a sacrifice now brother man said he explains this the way you the way we feel on a daily basis you're perfected with our sacrifice he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if you wasn't worthy he knows your heart yeah that's right he knows what you are right he knows your motives he knows what you are but there's traps all along the road and the devil will cause you to stumble and you'll say I didn't mean to do that God he said see but you're still perfect because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day a bleeding sacrifice hanging Before the Throne of the almighty God hallu hallelujah thank now what are we talking about that when you come under the blood you're not a sinner anymore right when we come into it Lord there we are with no sin and not in our ourselves we were all Sinners watch brother brandom we're all Sinners but in you we are not Sinners we are Sons and Daughters of God in the seven seal when our sins are confessed it's put in the blood of Christ they'll never be known again God forgets them they never was even done as long as the sacrifice of the atonement is there for us that's it see we're not Sinners no more we're Christians by the grace of God but remember in our own selves we'd probably be just as bad as we ever were oh then you're not an angel do you know you're never going to be an angel because you never were an angel you always were a son or a daughter of God you say well I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him brother Ram said but I've come to represent him and remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner and neither are you we've got a blood sacrifice laying there and God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ Christ it's our voice but it's Christ's blood then it's Christ talking through us to God therefore we are not Sinners anymore we are Christians it's brother Bram I make so many mistakes but that's why Christ had to die with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you he took your mistakes your desire in your hearts to serve him that's what he died for so you could serve him your mistakes are not looked at word Prophet here Church your mistakes are not looked at they are not lotted to you he is our propitiation he is our sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to ser serve him my goodness every person in here can live above sin can live without sin I live in God you'll make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you you're subject to mistakes but God can't see it it's not one quote it's over and over and over I make a thousand mistakes each month each year sure I do but when I see I'm wrong God I didn't mean to do it I got trapped into it I didn't mean to do it forgive me Lord he said if I done wrong my brother I say brother forgive me I didn't mean to do it certainly God knows my heart there you are there is a blood sacrifice there is your atonement you see your atonement isn't just when you got saved and then if anything else happens in your life that you got to work this out and you got to be the best person if you ever made a mistake then you can't be a Christian and you can't be back in hey amen that come from a legalistic mind and it keeps the church bound so bound that they cannot rejoice in the power of the blood of Jesus Christ but there is an atonement for sin there is a created blood that hangs over the Church of the Living God and God can hear your voice but he can't see you because of the blood I tell you you ought to run under the blood this morning and begin to worship him through the blood let him hear your voice let him hear your voice through the blood father I love you father I worship you father I thank you Father I give you praise that through that blood you can worship Him the songs of redemption the songs of the grace of God oh I'll tell you this amen we are covered a real Christian is covered by the blood won't you stand with us amen a real Christian is covered by the blood this morning then it's not us speaking it's him speaking Glory Glory it's him speaking this morning he's speaking he's speaking through the blood my God if your life is hid under this blood then they're in the sea of forgetfulness and no man can dig them UPL not even God you know what he says that in reference to he says it in reference in coming into his prayer line he said if you come here and you've not confessed them sins he said the angel will call them right out before the congregation he said but if they've been put under the blood the secret of your hearts and the things in your life that you need or thought you have done if they're not under the blood he will expose them because if they're under the blood they're in the sea of forgetfulness and no man can dig them up that's right you're a Christian you don't have to hide hide it under the blood and then have a boness with what God has gave you I'll tell you this morning the preaching of the atonement the Roman Church would like to say that comes through them the atonement the Baptists and the lutherans and the Pentecostals would all like to say that comes through them now we're we're getting message preachers saying that's coming through them but I assure you it's coming through that great Ram that great Ram's Horn is sounding Out an atoning power over the church and when they come under that blood it can set you back at one with God it can scatter the sand so far that it can't be found it takes it out of the memory of God and then it not only does that but it keeps you covered from day to day what could we say thank God for that one little word called it atonement thank God for that little word called atonement bring it under the [Music] blood bring it under the blood [Music] bring it under the blood bring it under the blood bring it under the blood there's

[Applause] blood you got a mountain this morning when a prophet was driving out in the west you remember he looked over and there was a mountain peak there was Seven Peaks taken up b r a n h a m is that right but out of them Seven Peaks three of them was taller than all the others he said that last Peak there was nothing Beyond it on the continental divide one way it went toward the west the other way it went back at the place of the divide the last peak of the ministry was the the third pool that's exactly where the church is standing today she's standing on that mountain of the third pool on the right side of the Divide headed toward the kingdom of God possessing every bit of the promises that God has gave her to possess in this age come on church it's been in God's mind the whole time when he changed the name Abram to Abraham this was on his mind this mountain was on his mind this people was on his mind come on you don't have to back up you don't have to retreat you don't have to walk away you are the Church of the Living God designed for this hour anointed for this hour given the grace for this hour this is the time for it church this is the hour for it I have to be careful how I prophesy one of the sisters come up and said you kept Hing no retreat she said the power behind it they shut the Winter retreat down I I think she was kidding I don't mean no camp but I mean no retreat there's no reason to back off of this mountain God intended this for you all the time and then produced a breach of the blood to put you on the mountain and keep you on the mountain and standing on this mountain you can withstand Satan any place anywhere any time under in authority and if something happens to make you think you would have to get off of this mountain bring it under the blood bring it under the blood this morning ask God to forgive you for it and when God forgives you walk off and leave it if God don't remember it why you bring it up every week why you bring it up every day why you bring it up every prayer some time or another you got to draw a line step across and say God it's under the blood Satan it's under the Blood church it's under the blood you might need to tell your friends you might need to tell somebody it's under the blood I don't want to have to go around this every week and every day and every time I get ready to do something you got to face it forget all of that put it under the blood and go forward in the name of Jesus Christ come on church he already died for it why you stay guilty for it he took the shame he took the guilt he took the death he put it under the blood then it was for us this morning that we could possess that and we could move forward in that come on now you got that this Blood this blood that blood did one thing but this Blood did another that blood kept a memory that blood kept a conscience that blood of the GS and goats come back every year but under this blood if a man is ever put under this

blood and stay there and while you're standing under that blood God can't see your sin Satan has no right to accuse you of your sin so you have become a conqueror in your own land this morning by the blood of Jesus [Music] Christ that is the atoning power of the blood of Jesus Christ young people I want you to I want you to hear me if you're not careful a legalistic thought will get in your mind
