are this morning to to be able to have such a such a presence Amen in such a cold and dark world Amen but that that sun strikes the top of the tree first amen and that's where that Zion means that Sunny Hill that mountain where the sun shining and and you can feel the Rays of it this morning even as it shines upon the Church of the Living God and we in that third level catch that light as it shines in the evening amen what a what a blessing to be here today and amen we we do um thank the Lord for his grace and his Mercy this morning and um we want to maybe if we could just stand together today amen I know we're just going to go on a word of prayer but we do want to thank um you know in this time of this time I uh I think of fatherhood and I think of the moment that we live and I think uh if you study the statistics and I'm not getting into it today but the number one trouble that we have in the world today is a lack of fatherhood a lack of men taking positions and I know why it's a lot of pressure uh but but the men that have stood up and we want to thank you and to our elders in this church we certainly thank you and of course brother Ericson's like a dad to us all and we certainly thank you brother Ray thank you for [Applause] standing the position itself of fatherhood uh means a nourisher protector and upholder so you can see why that we would say that he would be like a dad to us and uh so we want to this morning just before we read the word let's just bow our hearts for a moment and let's speak to our father Lord we bow our heart this morning and even when your disciples ask you how they should pray you told them to begin with saying Our Father which art in heaven and Lord for us to be able to call you our father to know that you're our provider our supplier our protector oh Lord how that it settles our heart to know this morning that you're the one behind it all father we're asking you this morning that may the great presence of your living being come in this room father we bow our hearts in your presence and we ask you oh God as an assembly may you forgive every shortcoming Lord May father it just make a resounding feeling in this room this morning that each heart and each life have come to you this morning and ask for your great grace over them and that you would just come into this building Lord and you would break your word this morning that you would wash hearts and minds and that you would feed Souls Lord we're asking you today that you would make yourself known Among Us Lord and we want to welcome you here and father we invite you now to come take this part of the service and use it for thy Divine glory in Jesus name name we pray amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles today amen we would like to go to Ephesians chapter 5: 26 and verses 27 uh if you were with us Thursday night uh we spoke of on the washing of the Water by the word and I went into the Old Testament to show uh how that God provided now if you know notice the father is a provider how that God provided to the people in ashes of red heer which actually meant they just took the ashes of the red heer and mixed it with the water and that water was a water that washed them so in Ephesians 5 and 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen may God bless his word as you could be seated this morning amen of course amen speaking to you about that we um we spoke about the uh about the ashes of the red heer and how that they burned the red heer with cedar and Hep and and they burned that all together and they did it so that it would be mixed and so that means that you can't have just part of the gospel you got to have the whole thing I I loved brother uh Tim pret's example of a of a cliping a chicken wing amen if you get a one one wied animal it just runs circles amen I thought the whole meeting would have been worth it just for that one point amen it was so powerful amen but but you see amen uh it must be mixed together it's a mix and that's the beautiful thing is the right mix between the word and the spirit brings life now this morning I want to speak to you on this that we are Washed by the father's words Washed by the father's words so I don't want you to lose my direction or where we're going but it'll take me a moment to get there but just stay with me we're we're going to be uh we're going to be headed toward this washing of the Water by the word by the father's word now of course fatherhood is uh the very origin of the word father in the Bible amen it means of course a uh uh it means means to be a nourisher a protector or an upholder amen and you know the when someone says to you fatherhood amen it means more of a position that someone would hold because you know sometimes that there are people maybe who don't have specific Earthly fathers that have uh been fathers they and then they have people in their lives who have not at all been a genetic father but have been a great father unto them in other words some the person that would nourish and protect and and and and give to them amen so that's why sometimes there's like surrogate fatherhood or where there is a mentorship and things of this nature because actually uh real fatherhood when we say the word fatherhood this morning we we say father but really who defines what that word means and where does that really come from who is it that is able to to say what fatherhood means but you see brother brandham was telling you this he says now and and of course brother bram's own way of doing it he said I have a a young daughter sitting back there and she's my sweetheart and he said you couldn't hurt the child without hurting me now that was that's a pretty powerful thing and you'd have to be a dad to understand that that you you couldn't hurt one of my children without hurting me and brother M is saying this that you know you couldn't hurt the child without that because that's my baby and I love her and and and another little fell at home a little over years year old and he said she was trying to talk goooo and d da and he says now you couldn't hurt that child without hurting me so he's showing you different ages but they're both his children and one maybe talks a little pler and the other one goooo gyy but they're both his children and you couldn't hurt the child without hurting me now I hope you're hearing what a prophet's saying amen that when God has children now some of them are different ages and some of them talk different and some of them maybe uh understand things a little different but if you h one you've hurt the Lord and he says now I'd rather that you love that child than to love me now if there had to be love one for the other you love my child instead of me and I think that's what fatherhood is like now it that's what fatherhood is like so if you really want to get God's attention you start loving his children do wonderful things for his children amen that's fatherhood then and if that is fatherhood it is an attribute of of God then if we be God's children then God wants us to love one another and then doing so we love God now watch this then fatherhood is an attribute of God so what you what you classify as a father and if you really ever see a real father and you see him really being a father to his family then you look at that and there's something of admiration in your heart to see someone stay or to go through things or trials and they they really are a father over their home there's many many of you that are great examples of this but but that attribute didn't come from you that attribute come from God that's why you can see fatherhood in men who don't even have children because it's not the it's not uh it's after an attribute of God so you recognize that it is and we also uh we um how could we say this when we see it we respect it and we love it because it's a great it's a great feeling to see that because you know then fatherhood is real that it it actually is real it's not just some put on something fatherhood is real now uh and I see men do things for their children and they uh uh act certain ways and and but yet they do that out of love and it's just as what a father does now brother B says now see here's the thing and the comforter if we'll just live close to him he'll provide something else for us now that is an Insight that we can see what ordinary persons never see when you're born again and you see him you know him you can have seen him and he will abide with you forever oh he is a good father now he is the Fountain of all goodness amen the great resource of all goodness and fatherhood belongs in our God he is so good to his believing children he provides the sunshine and we couldn't live without it see we couldn't live it because there would be nothing growing a sunshine is a great thing see yet we look and we say oh it's the Sun so we look over at it but the sunshine is important to our life and it helps us and give us strength and the natural man see it's a spiritual Sunshine that we can live in all nature types of spiritual like we had good food that we eat at the table it's a type of good food that we eat from the word of God see what it is is an outward expression so you can look at the Sun and you say oh how wonderful the Sun but there's a source of that sun you can you can drink the water and there's a source of that and and the source of all of that is Our Father which is in heaven and provided the Natural Things of life that we might be able but that same father also amen is has the responsibility of our spiritual lives and and it's just like a natural father if all we do is work and live in an economy and provide for the home but there must also be the spiritual nourishment of a home so that is an attribute of almighty God as he is the father of all of us he is the one that provides that now now God himself loves fatherhood and this this quote specifically is very powerful it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed and brother Ram explaining of course if you've heard many people they say well God has a purpose but you see but the message of the hour is that brother randam told us what the purpose of God was it's not just God has a purpose but we know what his purpose is and he said the first thing he wanted to do is to reveal himself to the people and he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who covered space and time and he could he is too great to ever be revealed to the people because it was too mysterious and how could that great being see then after we went beyond the cycles of hundreds and billions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite and Eternity a creative culture now this is a seventh grade education speaking here and a great culture that it was he said but what what he wanted to do amen I love that what he wanted to do what God's intended purpose what he wanted to do is he loved fatherhood and he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become the son of man see that's the reason Jesus kept saying son of man they don't know what he was talking about many of them see do you get that he wanted to express and one of his great three-fold purposes now watch this God loves fatherhood and he is a great father but the only way to express his fatherhood was that he would become the son of man I Tell You Folks when you stop and think about that just for a moment you realize then that the only way that God could ever express himself was as the son of man that the son of man would be God's expression of fatherhood that would be when you see the son of man then you see expression of fatherhood now what is fatherhood it is protector it is provider amen it is a Defender you see then the son of man the ministry of son of man would be the provider of the church it would be the nourisher it would be the protector all of the things that a father is to his family the son of man Ministry would be to the Church of the Living God it would be fatherhood now watch brother bam explain this in questions and answers the pillar of fire is a logos that went out of God it's actually the attribute of the fullness of God and it come into the form where it could be seen and the anointing of that Spirit went forth condescending see God the Father the logos that was over Israel he says had to become a blood offering see the Loos amen become flesh and dwelt among us and that is where the Loos dwelt in the human body was as a sacrifice and when that man was made in the image of God God came came down see father came down in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and God together see God and man Embrace when you look at the cross amen I'm talking about fatherhood you're talking about father doing something so he could provide healing to the church so he could provide sin sacrifice to the church father did this you you could just look at the cross and you could say oh it's this and it's this but what the real intended purpose is is that God would show fatherhood to the Church of the Living God that he would show care he would take responsibility he wouldn't just let you go he wouldn't just let you be he wouldn't just let it go with that but father left his home in glory and took on a human body to redeem your life I'll tell you this God embraced each other brother man said it God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sunship when the logos became flesh and dwelt among them that's why Jesus said I come from God and I go back to God it's the death burial and resurrection and Ascension and he was taken back to sit at the right hand see it was the authority that he returned to now in the paragraph 110 he says it like this the logos that was in him which was the spirit of God that anointing through the satifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is Anointed with the same logos now I tell you amen the expression of human language was not I don't have the ability to deliver to you the depth of the statements that this Prophet is making listen what he's saying the exposition church he said see in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the Very substance of God was made flesh see the great spirit God under which no man could approach which which no man see no fatherhood could be given there watch what he says the great spirit God Amen no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold is now tabernacled in the flesh and dwelt among men expressing the fullness of God to man that's why in John 1:18 he said no man has seen him at any time the only begotten which is in the bosom of the father ha declared him that's why the scripture says he's in the bosom of the father and hath declared him who God on occasions would manifest his presence by The Cloud of the pillar of fire struck fear in the hearts of man but this God whose heart characteristics was made known only by the revelation of words through prophets listen now it's only made known by the revelation of the word through prophets fatherhood is only expressed through son of man look what he's saying it's made through the prophets now he became Emmanuel God With Us declaring and the word declare is taken from the Greek word often interpreted see which means to thoroughly explain and make clear that it is the Living Word Jesus did he brought God to us for he was God he brought God to us for he was God now what are we looking at we're looking at expression see he revealed God to us so perfectly in Clarity that John could say say that which was from the beginning which we have heard see which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon with our hands we have handled the word of life for life was manifested and we seen it glory be to God John what a revelation that which for us from the beginning has declared itself and we have seen it and we have believed it that's why John said I declare unto you the things which I have seen and heard Amen in the beginning watch the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and expressed the grace and the and the realities of fatherhood to the Church of the Living God at which we had heard from the beginning we seen it with our eyes amen and we looked upon it the word of life for life was manifested we have seen it and show unto you eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us I think these are powerful statements which we have seen and heard declare unto you that also we may have fellowship with us for truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ when God was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh and he that hath seen me ha seen the father oh my now in John the 14th chapter let's just read it together and I I pray you just bear with me a moment in this in this Foundation here it's a I I am going somewhere in John 14 And1 now we're looking at fatherhood can only be expressed as the son of man now Jesus is the expression of God and John 14 And1 let not your heart be troubled you believed in God believe also in me and In My Father's House of many mansions and if we're not so would not have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know and Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me and if you had known me you should have known my father also so and henceforth ye know him and have seen him isn't that powerful Jesus is so expressing the father that he said from henceforth you know him and ye have seen him and Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father now there's there's probably be a good 20 sermons brother BR preached on this show us the father and it suffices us and Jesus said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet thou Hast not known me Phillip and he that has seen the father when he has seen me have seen the father then how saith then show us the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me and the words that I speak unto you now you got to hear this real clearly is everybody with me and the words that I speak now remember my Title Here Washed by the father's word and The Words which I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works the words you are hearing are not my words they are my father's words but he could only express them through the son of man and I tell you we ought to take a shou and fit for a little while amen The Words which I speak unto you they are not my words I I did they wasn't B born in a in a in a school somewhere there wasn't birthed in intellectualism somewhere but the creative logos almighty God took on a body and was speaking to a Congregation of his disciples and he was saying to them the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but they are my fathers and if you believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake now what it it's a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful thought now as we continue Jesus and things that are to be brother Bram says it like this now don't let your heart be troubled he said now you believe God believe also in me as you have believed in God believed me in other words as you have believed the father believe me because I am the Son of God and God now that's a powerful quote you you want to write that down I never heard anybody read that quote like that because I I don't but I'm sure somebody has but I just caught it amen uh the other the other evening look what he says because I am the Son of God see and God I am the Son of God and God see now I'm telling you that because we're living in a region where everybody was they they make such a big deal about him being the Son of God but they can't never say he is God but let me read this to you again I am the son of God and God in other words I and my father are one see amen my father is dwelling in me and what you see do I'm doing it's not me it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus was telling them I'm only a channel the word is working through and the word is my father father and when you see my Works you've not seen my Works you've seen his works when you've heard my voice you didn't hear my voice you heard his voice now watch what he says cuz in John 5: 19 Jesus answers this of course there was a lot of disturbance over him healing only one man out of a great Congregation of people and when they when they did they questioned him he answered and said unto them verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself now do we believe that the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do Now whats so things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now brother random says in other words he done it by Vision verily I say unto you the son done nothing he sees the father doeth son like it was he that saw the father doing in other words he saw it by Vision what was about to happen in the second coming brother brandom says it like this the Lord Jesus Jesus came down and give P people power to heal the sick but I don't think he ever did this see see I would like to see our lord Jesus come down and give power to people to heal the sick but I don't think he ever did this even himself didn't claim to do it see he never did it anything he said himself that he wasn't a Healer he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father he's the one that tells you see I can do nothing of myself but I see the father doing in other words he acted just a drama what the father showed him to do and that's the way it is now my goodness so here we're going to our precious Lord Jesus and we're looking at the son of man Ministry and we hear him saying I'm not the Healer I'm only doing what I see with my father it's not my words it's my father's words it's not my works it's my father's works because God loves fatherhood and the only way he could express being father was through the son of man I tell you it's a powerful thing now because the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father brother R said Jesus never claim to be a Healer it's not me that doeth the works it's my Father which dwelleth in me that doeth the works he shows me what to do by Vision Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever he goes into it again Jesus never claimed to be a Healer how many knows that Jesus said the son can do nothing see it's not me that doeth the works it's my Father which doeth the works and he the son can do nothing but what the father sees him doing see that son doeth likewise now is that the truth I'm I'm asking Prophet ask it could the Son of God lie no sir that's true then Jesus never performed one Miracle without God showing him first what to do isn't it amazing people today say well if you're really an adopted son go out here and raise all the dead Jesus didn't do that Moses didn't do it Enoch didn't do it Elijah didn't do it no man of God ever operated outside of the will of God that's why the Holy Ghost was given to the church was to continue the work of God not the work of man this is not my work come on Church true word Tabernacle is not not brother Ray's work it's not brother Wayne's work this is God's work this is God's work you see what it is he uses a vessel but it's God working through the vessel amen it can't be can't can't come up here and say look how wonderful my Ministry no if you have any Ministry brother Bram said it's you got out of the way if there's any gift it's you got out of the way and the greater the meeting is because it was the greater of a surrender amen because there is a Resurrected choss God that's in the midst of the church trying to work in the church and I say god let's open the doors and give him room to work cuz he's a real reality is the fatherhood of God now if you go to the Bible again in John 10 and verse 24 let's read then Jews came around about him and they said how long do you make us doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly and Jesus said I told you and you believe me not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but if if you believe not because you are not my sheep as I have said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me he's talking about his children now my children will recognize me now in John 10:28 and I've give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand oh brother I wished I had an hour on that scripture amen and I give unto them eternal life offspring of God comes from the source of God if you have human life you had a human father but my father is not just Randall Lawson amen I have a heavenly father and that father has a spiritual life it's called eternal life and Eternity never began nor can it end and he that hath gave un to us eternal life no man can pluck you out of his hand listen I tell you what we are to get in a reality Our Father brought security to the house didn't he Our Father brought security to the house the son of man brought security to the church he didn't put us on one day with him one day you're out one day you're up one day you're down that wasn't what our father did our father spoke words to the son of man to say to you that I have given unto you eternal life and no man no man can pluck you out of my hand let me ask you who is greater than my father who is greater than my father amen you say well sin abounds and I say grace abound much more amen amen there's nothing that can pluck you out of the hand of God when God gives you eternal life amen you are saved for Time and Eternity Hallelujah I'm talking about security by the son of man amen that's why when they were on that rocking boat brother Jeremy they were just as secure as sitting in their living rooms because the son of man fatherhood was being expressed in the middle of the storm there is a security he's in the boat Hallelujah my goodness I was thinking this morning amen with the scripture said I'll be a father to the fatherless I said oh dear God have you not been amen how the holy Spirit would come and how that he would do it see nothing could separate you I always love it when I look at these scriptures because here's the thing nothing shall pluck you out of my hand that's a pretty determined statement isn't it in other words as one who knows the future how could you say nothing shall pluck you out of my hand unless you knew the future amen of the seed you're talking about cuz you could say well nothing has plucked you out of my hand that would be one thing nothing has amen but he said nothing will so this is the god that controls the future can I say this fatherhood expressed in son of man can tell you about tomorrow he can tell you about the next day listen we're sitting here right now with Russia down there in in Cuba again 19 now y'all know it's if you're studying any of these news articles you know right now we're in uh we're in a taking time bomb sure amen and if you just use the Russia portion leave Israel out of it bring Russia into this and look at Ukraine and Russia do youall know that G7 Summit just happened and the American president put his head together with a pope and they took a picture together I think it's pretty symbolic that their headships are coming together do you know what they done in that G7 Summit you know what they did they took $50 billion that they had blocked from Russia in other words the rich people in Russia have have have had the American and the and the European governments have took money away from them and I forget what they call it it's like an embargo but it's not the right word sanctions they put sanctions on the Russian Millionaires and billionaires and they have just loaned Ukraine $50 billion do of Russian money to throw bombs at Russia and the pope was behind the whole thing you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about 1960 Cuban Missile Crisis we're right back at it amen and and and hey look and this is what we're reading in the news folks come on this what we're reading in the news what ain't we going to read they got they got bombers setting off the coast of Florida right now that have long range uh missiles nuclear bombs that can reach New York Washington DC Chicago Illinois they're only a 100 miles off of Florida and a prophet told us in the 60s they they got a bomb with America's name on it is that right they don't have to build the bomb they don't even have to carry across the sea it's setting off your Coast right now but the same Prophet that seen that seventh vision and said I see American ashes if he knew it was going to be bombed by nuclear bombing he could also tell you where you're going to be when it happens and he said there'll be a bride setting in glory when the bombs begin to drop the son of man brought security Hallelujah he didn't bring fear and fail here he brought security to the church hey sting under the lock wings of Elohim we know exactly about tomorrow and he that he has gave eternal life to there is no man can pluck them I know you know I know you so well brother Wayne he was there with me in my past and he's here with me this morning well let me let me say something to you and open your eyes and he also is with you in your future he is in your tomorrow before you get to your tomorrow there's aund ways I could prove it but the best way I ever saw was when Congressman Upshaw said in brother bram's meetings the son of man Ministry told him why he was hurt said you fell off of a wagon as a young child and this is what's wrong with your back amen that was Congressman Upshaw told him what he had done told him how many times he had looked for it but he said do you have a certain colored suit and the man said yes he said well I'll tell you thus sayith the Lord I see you walking down the sidewalk in that same suit he had just bought the day before I see you walking down that sidewalk and I'm going to meet you and greet you he said it's thus saith the Lord do you know what happened amen the son of man was already in the future of Congressman Upshaw he told him what had been he told him what was and he told him what was going to be the fatherhood of God is expressed in the son of man he is going to take care of you it don't matter what this world does it don't matter what the church world does we have heard from father Hallelujah my if I don't make you want to go into a shou and fit to think amen amen that he's climbed upon on the heot and he watches over the sparrow he watches over you and me do you see there's chords of Prophecy connected to your life that Satan will never be able to break those bands right my father gave them and he is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand John 10:30 says it again I and my father are one then that's when the Jews took stones to Stone him and they answered and said many good works have I showed you of my father from which of these Works do you Stone me and the Jews answered saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou being a man make thyself God and Jesus answered and said it is not written in your law is it not written in your law now if you study brother Bram this is a powerful point and if you if you take it home you can read it Jesus answered and said unto them is it not written in your law he said there's the son and he said I said ye are Gods he said there's the father Jesus same voice same ey audience he says is it not written in your law he said there's the son speaking and then I said he said there's the father speaking come on it's Jesus Christ same yesterday and forever brother Ram makes a point out of it that's why when you're listening to a Kentucky hillbilly William brandom come on you got to be able to discern you got to be able to divide the word of God I know there's a bunch bunch of Fanatics went way Wild on all that stuff but we can't help what what what has been and done it's but it's the truth see and he called them gods and who the word of God came to and scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father have Sanctified and I sent into the world thou blasphemist because I said I'm the Son of God but if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do though you believe me not believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I am in him now watch this 10th verse of John 14 believest no thou not that I am in the Father the father of me the words I speak I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works see what is happening here is Jesus even asked them to search the scriptures now he didn't tell them go home and get your tradition books out and see if this was going to happen you go home get your get your Methodist um Creed books out and see if this is going to take place that wasn't what he said he said search the scriptures for in them you claim to have eternal life and they are the ones that speak of me see you will not come to me that you may have life John 40 541 for I receive not the honor of man but I know and that you have not the love of God in you I am coming my father's name and you receive me not now if another shall come in his own name you will receive him do you see that denomination coming in his own name in the name of blasphemy they have an idea they're coming in his own name and people are receiving that but it's not my father speaking now you'll get to it later remember this there's Apostolic fathers right the church has Apostolic fathers and they have fathers of the Nan Council so there is a fatherhood to the church and either it is an Apostolic fatherhood or it's an ican counsel fatherhood now watch this because you see Jesus Jesus speaking here and he's letting them know that his works are testifying that I and my father are one if you turn me down you turned him down he's letting them know and watch and show us the father brother B said see John 14:8 said I am I am the father and I are one see the father dwelleth in me he doeth The Works my father he doeth The Works see the son can do nothing see it was God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now I'm going to read you a couple quotes here and I think they're so powerful but let's give them let's give them some advancement into our age spiritual food and due season brother bam speaking here he says now watch he didn't stop him he went right on performing and carrying on his duty and God can confirming everything he done he said I'm not by myself my father and I are one he dwells with me it ain't me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me listen to what he says I'm not by myself now you're looking at the man and you're thinking he's by himself but he said I'm not by myself I am my father are one so well me and my wife are one brother BR said it's a different kind of one he said I I can see you and I can see your wife it's you're one but you're two different people he said but when you're looking at Jesus he said they're one he said you're looking at God in his Tabernacle they are one person they're not two people it's one person but father God could not express himself unless he was in the son of man office hey man watch this the father these are powerful quotes some of you that study these areas you'll love this quote and and John uh in in Rising of the sun he said who condemn me of sin now whatever God wrote and whatever the prophet said I'm the answer see what they said I do he came as a prophet the son of man and he proved it see the Dynamics was there to fire off the mechanics he was the mechanics the son himself and the father was the Dynamics Oh Glory to God Amen it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me and he splatters forth the Dynamics and makes the thing come to pass Hallelujah church amen I tell you it's a powerful thing when you can see what was doing the work in Jesus Christ he was saying it's not me it's the Dynamics it's the father that dwelleth in me brother BR said there's the real power of God riseing the sun you can do nothing without me see and he is the word it's the father and father sent me so send I you he fired me and pushed me into everything as the father sent me so send I you he fired me and pushed me into doing I did only that which was pleasing he sent me and so send I you with the same mechanics and it takes the Dynamics to operate it amen when you see that the father is the mechanics of the Dynamics to the mechanics of the word look at this Jesus says in Awakening Jesus brother B said it like this he said his body sets tonight as a sacrifice in heaven now let we got to get real clear there is a Corporal body of Jesus Christ how many believes that with me what good is there in Eve without an Adam there is a Corporal body of Jesus Christ but that body is not here tonight this morning it's in another dimension and according to the prophet of God it sets in heaven tonight this morning that body cannot come to this Earth see he but it's his life that returns that body cannot come but it's his life that comes what was his life it was father see it's father that is coming Oh Glory to God I feel like I just tear the the walls off of this building this morning amen it's the father that was coming it was the Dynamics that was coming the Dynamics of this word is the same life that was operating in Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what it was and it's come back upon the church in the form of the Holy Spirit it wasn't the body that did it anyhow it wasn't the I tell you what when Jesus comes we're going to have this and when Jesus comes we're going to have this and brother BR says I'm not saying that sacriligious I'm saying people are putting the Revival in the future of his Corporal body and brother B said it wasn't his body that did it it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works I tell you it was the spirit of Christ that was doing them works and that same one is the father again has returned in this age to claim the sunship and the attributes of almighty God how will you know you're a son in this age unless the father comes down to identify you and let you know you're a son hallelujah amen what is it the return Jesus said I come from God I return to God I came from the father I'm going back to the father and then Paul met him on the road and it was a pillar of fire he called that God fatherhood and he said what is your name my name is Jesus then the father and the son has the same name glory be to God I know I can't preach all these points man I want to Hallelujah do you see what it was it was father and he was manifesting himself in a pillar of fire but what he did was he got into that body and began to express himself the word of God it identified him and the word of God identify you as well you see now watch they believe me for the works for they are the manifested Word of Promise oh my goodness amen now here it is it's the father that dwelleth in you he's the one that does the speaking now here's the thing Jesus in John 14 in the third verse look what he says if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also now I I I y' y'all forgive me but I I sometimes pay real close attention to detail in these scriptures and and and it's beautiful that he said I go but the same one that said I go said I come now that's not two different ones it's the same one it's not me that speaketh but my father that speaketh my words are not my words but I'm going to go and I'm going to come you say preacher you you lost your mind knowing Matthew 24 Jesus's own words he prophesies a place for himself and says as the lightning Cometh From the East and shineth to the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be I come I go I come and the son of man shall come in the last days is that right now you read it from Luke 17 and it'll say this even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so the revealing of the son of man and the coming of the son of man are the same thing it's the same thing folks I will come but then I will I will come and receive you unto myself now father is going to return and speak that's amazing to me personally that in first Timothy he says I will show you in times past who is the blessed and only potentate king of kings and he's the Lord of lords who hath immortality dwelling in light which no man can approach and no man seeing to him honor and power forever which in times P 1 Timothy 6:15 that he will show who is the only so that will come a time that he will reveal himself father will reveal himself again the only way he can express himself is through son of man now now this then and and I I got to hurry so you you can stay with me here real quickly watch this then brings in the idea of prophetic Ministry in the end time if you if you're a studier of scripture you'll know that the scripture tells us that the heavens must receive Jesus until the restitution of all things right so then we know there got to come a restitution to the church or a restoration of the word which they had lost has got to be restored now if you're a Bible reader you'll find that in Revelations the 10th chapter the first verse down to the 7eventh it'll tell us that a mighty angel will come come out of heaven and he will descend with an open book and when he does John was going to write it but there was a voice that John don't write it but seal it until the seventh angel begins to sound when the seventh angel begins to speak if the word if the book The Angel was bringing was the word then that seventh angel would have to be a prophet right if you go back in the scripture now the word only comes to a prophet Amos chapter 3 now if that word is coming to a prophet then there's got to be prophecy of a prophet coming in the end time then you go directly to Malachi the 4th chapter and the Bible said behold I send unto you Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord that's the fourth coming of Elijah so it's the spirit of Elijah using a man I don't know how to preach this quickly but y'all got to you you I know how many of you believe this so you got to really get in agreement with it and and and and just just go ahead and say Amen to it because it's the spirit of Elijah in a man is that right it's not Elijah himself that was only one time Elijah himself was on the Earth right and then it was the spirit of Elijah in Elisha and then it was the spirit of Elijah in John the Baptist but then in 1933 William brandham stood under the pillar of fire and Heard a Voice say as John the Baptist forun the first coming I'll give you a message and you'll forerun the second coming is that right then the spirit that was in John the Baptist would be in a man in the end time his name was William brandom he was a Kentucky hillbilly but that's not the important part the important part is who is it that was going to be using him to speak a prophet don't become a prophet a prophet is Born the prophet that's why he begin to see Visions even before before he knew the attribute of fatherhood but then when that Pillar of Fire began to came to him he began to understand behold I send unto you Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he would turn the heart of children back to Father Oh Glory to God he's going to turn these people to the word of God he's going to turn them back to the word of God back to the father what is it now see now watch brother Brandon will tell you very clearly but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ now he has come according to Matthew and Luke the son of man is to be revealed not a man God but it come through a prophet God but it came through a prophet that's the part that's killing people it came through a prophet they let the veil get in the way every time but listen if you would just get the veil out of the way you would see that it's father and he's come to secure Ure and provide and give this church everything that's in his mind Hallelujah he's going to come and show himself now now if you if you're a if you're a follower of the message of the hour and if you're just beginning these are important points to you especially this one because there's people that tried to make brother brandom deity and they've rode that horse till they have made a a very reproach out of the message of the hour and the prophet of God said I never came to do that at all is that right and he even go as far as to say when that Pillar of Fire came down on that River he said he appeared on that River and I was only standing there when he appeared amen he makes the distinction to tell you I am not the one that performs these things or do I pel these things as perfect as they are I'm only near when he does it I was only a voice that he used it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered to it spoke through me it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel it was the manifestation of the son of man it it was the manifestation of the son of man it's fatherhood expressing to an age it was the manifestation it wasn't the angel his message it's the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God and this Angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man watch's this what does a fatherhood do he gives food to the household he brings bread to the table he brings sustaining life a father would do this he said you're not feeding on me I'm not the one feeding you you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man father has brought a table full a seven course meal has been set out before you the Seven Seals have opened up amen did William brandom open them seals I say he didn't I say Revelation 5 said only the lamb could open that book and I say brother brandom got it the same time you got it but God brought it to a prophet to bring it to the people because father can only express himself through son of man somebody T take the office of son of man out of the church you know what they've done they've robbed you of every benefit they've robbed you of every nourishment they've robbed you of every security they've robbed you of Revival because they have taken father's words out of the church I'll tell you again and again brother Bram said it's not my voice it's not me I don't have control I do not it speaks itself it's my voice and I'm listening to myself talk just as you're listening to me talk Hallelujah can you imagine if brother Bram could have stood out of his body he was listening to himself talk like you listening to me talk he didn't know what was going to be coming out of his mouth folks the office of a prophet is an office of God the man William brandham was not the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man oh my you heard me tell you something didn't you that was not my voice but it was not me it was my voice but it wasn't me operating it it's a supernatural being now here's the thing looking unto the Unseen these are important things for us to catch as a believer in looking to the Unseen he said I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that gave the promise brother brandham has nothing to do in this do you think that voice lied come on Church Jesus said I don't do the works brother Brams the voice is speaking through him the same voice that spoke through our Lord spoke through this man and said it's not we Bram doing these things but it's the lord it's the one that raised up from the dead listen what he done he borrow a body and spoke to this church that you might have security that you might hear from heaven when the Prophet come down and said thus saith the Lord amen what does that mean lordship a household a father thus saith my father not my mother I'll tell you that's shout material right there it's not my church it's not thus saith my church it's thus saith my father the father of this house has spoken through the message of the hour I've got I've got a bunch of quotes I'm going to have to get through them quickly but I'm going to skip over them quickly for your time sake but you believe me that I am in him he that he is him speaking not me he's speaking through me then if it be his voice speaking through me then his presence is here now listen what he's doing he's telling you here his presence is here now if you wouldn't had that Prophet standing there father could have never expressed that to the church the same as your favorite television program could be playing but without a TV You' never see it the favorite radio station could be playing but without a radio you'd never hear it and father was sending things to the Earth but without a prophet you would never know he did it because fatherhood is expressed through the son of man hallelujah how is he going to get to the church he's going to operate through the channel of a prophet let's just say this you say well I want something uh brother Greg be is a supply house and I want Plumbing he's my channel that's the channel to get what I need that's a channel you I don't want to use salesman well maybe it's getting to the place now where you don't have to I don't know but let's just use it for for simple sake you get things through the sales he don't produce them he don't stock them but he handles them and he is a channel whereby things flow through him to the person who has need and a prophet is saying the words I'm speaking to you I didn't produce them I didn't operate them I didn't make them up I am just a channel and when you begin to pull it's not my voice you're hearing but you're pulling on a different vessel and then words begin to come to him because father was speaking through him Hallelujah you talk about a Father's Day you talk about a Father's Day I'm not talking about this marketing thing they're doing I'm talking about a Father's Day a day when my father has declared himself real among the Church of the Living God just as real as 2,000 years ago he has returned [Applause] amen H now here's the thing you'll find this end time Seven Seals had to be unfolded and we can be brought down to a prophet we're looking for it and we believe his spirit is Among Us now watch when Jesus came he did prove to be the Messiah the anointed one the father had come down and dwelt in him in the form of a dove from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased that's the reason he said I and my father are one see John bear a record of seeing that he's seen the Spirit come in to Jesus and he said I my father are one do you see that Abraham's Royal seed is to come in this end time as a royal bride seed is that right and just as Jesus was in Mary so was this bride seed in the Pentecostal age she was a seed hid in the husk just like brother random he he moved among all the denominations but he wasn't of that age he said I'm a man born of season and he was a seed laying in that shuck but when the seed begin to mature when the ripening of the sun when fatherhood begin to want to be expressed what happened amen that they pushed him right out of that and then the seed come out and when the seed uh I wish I had better words but I'll say it like this when a seed could express it itself without the covering of denomination to to to see that seed in the shuck you seen it partially unveiled but when the full maturity struck that seed when the hus pulled back you seen the real thing you seen the real seed and it's not until you get to the bright age do you really see the real Mind Of God coming down to the seed because it's making you move father is moving you now there's a lot of types there I'll get maybe to one of them later but watch this you find out the brother R said when the seed was delivered it said I come to do the will of my father there's that true seed see it comes at the opening of Seven Seals in Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation now when this word is being birth now I don't and I say this because I want you to study it if I say I don't have time I really really do not have time to declare this but I'm going to say it and then you can study it but in Revelation 16 remember there's three unclean frogs and remember brother BR said they're looking backwards now when they look backwards brother Bram said here's what they're doing they have heard the opening of the seals and these ning children the children of the of the denomination are looking back to see what their Nan father said about it so when they look back to the I see a counsel they disbelieve the word that has come to them in the open of the seals but you see what it is we are not hearing what the Nan fathers said about it that's why you come in well Dr so- and so said this about it and Dr so- and so said this about it and those men are great students of the Bible but the Bible reads different after the son of man speaks it's a new book folks when I heard brother brandham read certain scriptures I had never heard that scripture before though I had read it a hundred times I had never heard it before but when a prophet took the scripture he brought the intended meaning of Father dear God that's why that it became headship over the family because it was spoken from the father's word now here's the thing you can see hey man that when these Seven Seals begin to open it begins to finish up see it begins to finish up time now Jesus himself said as the Lo living father has sent me so send I you now he was a living father right and how wonderful brother Bram said like a father that very birth of Eternity would come down to a mortal being and help us that he would bring his word and give it into our mouths and our hearts and our ears that we might hear it and live now to redeem us from a curse we had nothing to do with it coming now here's a prophet speaking to you as God's children to redeem us from a curse that we had nothing to do with it coming father because it was done by the human race and were offsprings of that first couple were born in sin shaped in iniquity but a just and a Living God knows we had nothing to do with that but thou has made a way of escape and gave us the privilege of coming and how glad we are to come to Father's house oh my how glad we are to come to Father's House what are we speaking of the father coming to the father's house now if you were if you were just speaking this morning on a Father's Love and and you take the the types and The Parables of scripture I don't know of a greater place in the Bible than Luke 15 because it tells The Parables remember the three Parables it tells they're all about something being lost and something being restored and when it gets down to the prodical sun it was in that and which has been preached hundreds of times all over the Earth but what it was speaking about is speaking about a son that had went far away but there's a greater there's a greater understanding in that in that there was someone amen that was ready for him to return listen and and if and if you go back in the deeps of these things amen when the prodical son left his father's house and he went in the foreign country and began to spend his his his living now what what this happened was is he actually ended up in a place of poverty because he was out of the father's house see he ended up in a place of the wrong company cuz he was out of Father's house he ended up do y'all know the Bible said he was about to eat with the swine the husk I hope you hear me the Pentecostal message he was in such a shape that he he was sitting there but in the middle of that what did the Bible say he came to himself he was in the middle of famine and he came to himself he was in the middle of desperation and he came to himself he was a long ways from home but he came to himself because he was an attribute he had a father and he knew he had a father oh Hallelujah if I got a father then I got a place to return to if I got a father somewhere my father will feed me I love how the band says I'll go home and I'll work for my father and I'll go home even the servants even the servants in My Father's House eat better than what I'm eating even the service oh Church of the Living God so he got it made up in his mind I'm going back to Daddy's house and I tell you I'm going to go back as a servant and that's the way a lot of you return to God that's the way you come into the message you see well I tell you what they live good and I see their lives and I see the blessings over them I'm just going to go down there and I'm going to just fit in I'm not going to do anything I'm not really going to I'm just going to enjoy the benefits of being a part of such an assembly amen but when but when you started home but when you started home the prophet said an angel appeared to your mama and said to your mama the boys on his way home amen isn't that what happened in this age an angel appeared unto a prophet and said the bride is returning and she's going to return in her former glory and while she was a long ways off Hallelujah while she wasn't yet bride while she was still in denomination there was a worldwide Revival father left his home and came to you right here in Lima Ohio father held some meetings he held them over in Jeffersonville held them in Chicago Illinois and you said well I tell you there were thousand together but sometimes it was just one person come on church he went to Chicago Illinois for one didn't he just for one person father went a long ways because there was a bride returning returning back home after so many years brother R I love it cuz you know he went and met him he went right out where they were and you know what he did as a father would do that boy returning with dirty clothes and and got no shoes on his feet y all know the types of that the filthy rags he's returning in his own righteousness he ain't wearing shoes you know why brother Greg cuz people don't wear shoes in those days were slaves amen and when the father saw him he said that ain't no slave coming over that Hill that's my attribute coming over that Hill that's my son coming over that hill and when fatherhood began to be expressed that's when he could not no longer stay a servant listen and when this message came that's why we can't be just a church we can't be just another church we're the adopted Sons and Daughters of god father has came to us and as any father would do he wrapped the church he wrapped her in the Robes of adoption didn't he put it on you didn't he put Authority on you didn't he dress you I ain't left my subject he washed you with the water of his own word and he said you never were a servant and you never were a slave you always were a son that's not a church story that's the words of my father hallelujah amen you never did it in the first place I tell you I'm talking about the washing of a church by the word of their father the one that birthed you the one that knows you the one that was in eternity with you met you in the field and begin to wrap that robe around you and begin to put shoes on your feet I don't have time to walk and all that but I'll tell you this he took the way he walked and changed it and when he got ready to come home I tell you what he come home in a pair of shoes because it wasn't no slave coming home it was a son coming home and listen you can't never come back to God as a slave this bride will never be a servant this bride will never go through tribulation this bride listen that's why we don't spend every Sunday beating the people up in this church because you're not a servant you're not a slave you're a son to begin with you came from God you're going back to God Amen we just need to know who we are the father's words William brandom is not William brandom's words it's the father's words you always were a son you never were a sinner to begin with you were always his child hey I said well I don't know about this brother Wayne you know what's powerful to me he didn't just say it but Tommy proved it and as the Seed of Abraham we are the children of God as Abraham was a son so are we is that right and when God went to Abraham y'all this is very powerful Abraham met him at the tent door and he fed him calf and he washed his feet and he saw dirty clothes and he saw a rugged Man but when he spoke to him he said Lord that Jew who was pulled out there to believe in one God had just fed a man and called him God hallelujah he saw more than a man standing there he saw his father had came into a flesh and had gave him the promise I tell you what brother brandom said about it he said matter of fact that man didn't even preach the gospel he said he only told him the promises hallelujah hallelujah he only told him the promises and that's what this message come to do is to give you the promises the promises of God it's a Joshua commission now let me ask you this you say God God well let me tell you this Abraham's the one talked to him Abraham's the one that fed him and he's the one that called him Lord you say how could he do that go to Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th verse he said the word of God is a discerner of the thought andt it's the heart it's the word and what mecdc was is he was the word before he was flesh that's why that word was in that body and he was Discerning that same thing that same thing came to this generation when our lord Jesus stood there and he went to one woman I know you think you're unimportant but let me tell you God may call a man to preach at the platform for one man for one woman amen Jesus the king Messiah he said one day walking with his disciples he said to them I got a need to go down to Samaria and he pulled off from the crowd and went to one woman and began to speak with her and when he began to speak with her he began to perform a miracle H her brother Mike now people say to us today if God before us where are all the Miracles what Miracle are you talking about because the only miracle in the Bible that was the sign of the Messiah he said I virgin shall conceive and I will give thee a sign and that sign According To Jesus was the sign amen one given to Jonas that it was three days and the belly of the whm is raised again that sign is the sign of the Messiah which Jesus himself used at that woman and spoke to her and said go get your husbands she said I don't have one he didn't give her a marriage and divorce sermon let's get real folks he didn't set her down and rebuke her over her marriage and divorce situation he didn't tell her look I don't know if you can even join the church cuz you're you're all messed up and I don't know how we're going to do it listen can I say something to you sometimes eggs get scrambled and they're scrambled and they can't unscrambled scrambled eggs and that woman's eggs were scrambled she couldn't do nothing about the shape she was in law couldn't help her Pharisees couldn't help her but father had came to the well Hallelujah are you greater than our Father Abraham you bet you it was Abraham's father that was speaking to [Applause] her you greater than the one that dug this well our Father Abraham yeah yeah he was go get your husbands I ain't got one that's right cuz You' had five and the one you're living with ain't yours sir the one who the miracle was done on said I perceive you're a prophet brother BR said you want to know what it was ask the woman it was performed on she said I perceive thou a prophet and we know when the Messiah come he will doth these things who are you he said I am he that speaketh unto you Hallelujah what about Nathaniel brother used these very words watch that sign these very words asked the man it was performed on Nathaniel stood there and it was performed on him and he said I say thou the king of Israel he knew that sign was not a man right listen what about Simon bar Jonah when it was performed on him and when Jesus said who do you say I am he said I say th the Christ the son of the Living God he knew who spoke to him he knew it was more than a man he knew it was God using a man listen in this age I know we've seen these things and we've we've seen God do great Miracles but the same sign that was done in the Bible after 2,000 years has been done in this age you know why it's to prove to you it's the father speaking when a prophet looks over at the church and he begins to say to you that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever see it's the same Jesus that passed by zakus standing in a tree and told zakus what was in his heart and what's what he said to him he said salvation's come to your house today zakus he has came to seek that which was lost father came looking for that which was lost it was an attribute it was an attribute of God now here's the thing in this time we're living it's a great Easter again and this message coming I'm going to be leaving Waters of separation from this sermon so I won't be revisiting so let me put this point in here do you see it's the father and just as our father through Moses created the ashes of the red hepher so did he bring us the opening of this word that this word might become the prophet says it like this the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins that the blood of Christ think of it the dripping bloody word the blood the word of God bleeding is what's we're washing this bride in this is the bleach from Heaven itself to wash this bride it's something that can break up every stain of sin now now now and I'm not going to go through the whole thought on Clorox bleach but let me just let me just say this so we can we can we can attribute the point of sunship and and it's not pre-existence it's Eternal if you're a Sunday if you're a school student any of you graduated the last since the time I was even in high school that were teaching I'm sure many of you advance beyond that but how many knows what the periodic table of elements are I think they've added to it since since probably we were in school but what it is is like if you if you look look at water and you see water actually that's a that's a that's a combustion put two things together you call it water but it's in chemical it's H2O it's hydrogen oxygen two different things so there's a bond that puts it together right so if you're looking at any substance there are bonds off of that periodic table there is one part and two parts hydrogen one part oxygen they're bonded together now you call that water right but if you could break that water apart then it returns back to hydrogen in oxygen right so so any substance that is broke apart has to return back and that's brother brandom's whole point about preaching Clorox bleach to you because he says whenever you have a stain see see there's nothing of powerful enough to separate the cloth from the grease or the cloth from the from the stain he said so the Clorox bleach breaks the bond between your cloth and between whatever it is holding so so when it breaks up where does it go now that's that's a real question brother said when the when the ink leaves the shirt where does it go right he said it's got to go somewhere he said see it goes back to the gases that formed it so that gases broke up and it goes back to its periodic table it goes back to where it belongs so that ink was only a combination of things it wasn't the original because the original was on that table right so it was this part of this and this part of this and this part of this now you can see that you didn't come from the word you were birthed in the earth first and that's where sin got mixed into your life and that's where as a young man or a young woman you grow up and you think well this is your identity because you think this way and you believe this way and you come from this and all of the sudden you become in your identity a sinner you become oh I'm the son of this person and this and I belong to this and I'm a part of this and all of that is developing who you are and how you think and what you believe amen and unless you meet something that has power to separate that identity from the former identity then you'll always remain there but God rich in Mercy had decided that my sons and my daughters that are in this leody Dean age I will not leave the filth of leody on them but I'll produce a bleach I'll produce a water I'll produce a word and that word can separate The Sinner from the Sun and he could say to you you wasn't always a sinner you were a son to begin with and when he begins to preach to you it begins to wash it begins to wash and when it begins to wash something what happens to the sin brother Brandon said it goes back and lays on the head of the devil he said the sin goes back to its originator it goes back to the head of the devil but what about the son what happens to him I'm reading the quote he says it comes in in perfect fellowship with the father again see if you can recognize the message coming from father then you'll see why that you heard it so gladly for when Jesus was looking at Peter and he said who do you say that I am and he said I say that thou art Christ the son of the Living God he said Peter flesh and blood have not revealed this unto thee but what but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed this unto thee Peter and this is the key to my kingdom and this is the rock where I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell won't be able to Prevail you'll never build a wall big enough to keep my children away from me there will be not enough sin that ever could destroy one of them to keep them out of my presence I'll go where they are I'll do what is needed I will manifest what is possible because they are my attributes let me tell you this morning you sitting here today as the children of God that has the Holy Ghost you never began on any day and if you didn't begin you're not going to end and I don't care what the devil does I don't care what comes into life I don't care what attacks you or what comes at you my father has brought a protection in his word to the Church of the Living God and he supplies you listen he's washing you and giving you his Mercy what is it tonight amen that's the very thing that a prophet is saying amen that she's a part of that word and she is a spoken word child do you see this morning that you're a part of this word to begin with hallu you didn't become a part of this when you heard it right but when he said behold I send unto you Elijah you were a part of that prophecy then even all the way back in the mind of God but father left his porch kind musicians come this morning Father left his porch but he could only express fatherhood as the son of man and he was the son of David and the Son of God the son of man brother BR said see throughout them ages the Son of God he said but he's going to return to Israel as the son of David a king he said but between those two dispensations he's going to reveal himself as son of man it'll be a short work that's what prophesied in Abraham it was just a short time yeah but he performed a miracle on them and they knew who it was that same Miracle has been performed in this age listen folks over 8,000 times and it never was wrong one time how many here in this building sat in a meeting and heard that discernment I think brother Samuel was you in a meeting and heard the discernment of the Prophet yeah I know that he hosted the ones I think in Hot Springs Arkansas I believe the same thing the Queen of Sheba listened to the same thing that Nathaniel heard the same thing look that was the sign but there's a voice that follows that sign and here that voice is today and whenever this bride becomes the voice it's just a man you're hearing it's a father feeding it's the father securing it's the father supporting I'll tell you this morning I don't know about you but I'm glad to be at father's house I'm glad to be at father's house won't you stand with us this morning [Music] He Knows My Name he knows my thought he SE that fall and he is me when I [Music] call I have a maker he for my heart thank you Father and before even time again my life was in his [Applause] hand He Knows My Name he knows my thought he se he still and more oh and he be I [Music]
