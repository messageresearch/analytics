[0:00] a little weak life. It put up a couple
[0:01] little shoots. That was a Luther's. It
[0:04] sure don't look like the grain that went
[0:06] in the ground, but the life is coming
[0:07] out now.
[0:09] Then it went on to stalk.
[0:12] Then what happened in the days of John
[0:15] Wesley? What did he do when he brought
[0:18] out sanctification? He stayed with the
[0:20] word. And what did he do? The Luthers
[0:23] had organized and made an organization.
[0:26] So it was time for something to happen.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; The masterpiece is being built now. What
[0:34] did he do? What did he do? He protested
[0:37] that angle in church
[0:40] came out in the reformation as a tossel.
[0:46] What is it? The seeds coming to life
[0:48] growing now. Now the stalk doesn't look
[0:51] like the seed. Neither does a tonsle.
[0:55] Now, Pentecostal brethren throughout the
[0:58] nations, I want you to listen, my
[1:00] brother, if this is the last message
[1:01] I'll ever preach.
[1:04] This is my masterpiece.
[1:08] Do you notice when the wheats the corn
[1:10] or wheat that falls into the ground,
[1:13] when it begins to farm back to its its
[1:16] grain again?
[1:19] What's nature?
[1:21] Nature exactly is God. God working in
[1:24] nature. It's all it can. But from the
[1:27] Pentecostal revival as they think was
[1:30] the seed, it wasn't. Now watch. But
[1:33] something come forth just like the seed.
[1:36] And watch what Jesus said in St. Matthew
[1:38] 24:24.
[1:40] That the two spirits at the last days
[1:43] would be so close together it would
[1:46] deceive the elected if possible.
[1:49] Now that stalk don't look nothing like a
[1:51] seed. Neither does a toss look like a
[1:54] seed.
[1:55] But notice now, not in Luther's day, but
[1:58] in the last day.
[2:02] The first thing, there's wheat farmers
[2:03] sitting here. The first thing that comes
[2:05] forth on a wheat seed,
[2:08] you would almost think it was a seed,
[2:10] but what is it? It's the husk.
[2:16] It forms a little outside thing like to
[2:21] hold the seed.
[2:23] It forms a husk, but the husk is not the
[2:26] seed no more than the tossel or the
[2:28] stalk was.
[2:32] It's only a carrier of the life,
[2:36] the corn of wheat. Then of St. John 12,
[2:39] you see Jesus speaking the wheat after
[2:43] the tossel after uh Wesley puts forth
[2:48] the husk
[2:50] which is the foremost like the grain of
[2:54] anything else.
[2:57] The husk is more like the grain. It's
[2:58] coming more like the grain all the time.
[3:00] The one that went in the ground.
[3:03] And when it comes forth the stalk, it's
[3:06] got life in it, but it sure isn't the
[3:07] grain. Comes forth the tsle, the pollen,
[3:11] it still isn't the grain. And then it
[3:14] comes forth the husk, and it's just in
[3:17] the shape of the wheat.
[3:21] Just exactly like the grain of wheat,
[3:24] but yet it isn't the wheat.

[48:52] Anxiety. Worrying about what tomorrow

[49:02] to be a vessel of wrath, but you've been
[49:04] elected to be a message believer this
[49:07] hour. You're called to be a vessel of
[49:09] mercy. Amen. That means God didn't call
[49:12] you to pour his judgment into you. He He
[49:15] called you, Amen, to pour out mercy and
[49:19] more mercy and more mercy. The Bible
[49:21] says to you, his mercies are new every
[49:24] morning. Amen. In other words, you
[49:26] stumble today. Amen. But there will be
[49:29] mercy tomorrow. grace and goodness and
[49:32] glory and hallelujah. Amen. It's good to
[49:36] be one of his children. Amen. He's got
[49:39] us in his hands.
[49:42] Amen. He didn't bring us this far to
[49:44] leave us.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. No fear. No fear in our hearts
[49:48] today. Just faith. Amen. He called you
[49:51] to be a Mary of this hour. Amen. He
[49:54] didn't ask you to be strong. He didn't
[49:56] ask you to be perfect. He just asks you
[49:59] to submit to the word that he already
[50:01] spoke over you
[50:02] &gt;&gt; and accept what it is that he's made up
[50:04] his mind he's going to do in you
[50:06] &gt;&gt; in this day. We so appreciated that
[50:10] service last night.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Just to just to just really hit the
[50:14] ground running this camp meeting.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh you know I appreciate the
[50:20] direction the I appreciate the ministry
[50:23] that we had and and I appreciated the
[50:25] response.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's one thing for God to
[50:28] inspire a minister to stand in the
[50:30] pulpit and present an opportunity,
[50:33] &gt;&gt; but it does my heart good to see young
[50:35] people seize that opportunity,
[50:37] &gt;&gt; respond to the preaching of the word.
[50:38] Come with faith. Amen. To to meet the
[50:41] Lord. That's what Brother Bram said
[50:43] about Mary in the message, believest
[50:45] thou this? You know, God spoke a word to
[50:50] her. Brother Bram said she didn't after
[50:52] after she received that word, she didn't
[50:54] have to have any signs. Come on. She
[50:57] &gt;&gt; It wasn't about It wasn't about what she
[50:58] felt. It wasn't about
[51:01] &gt;&gt; No, actually in her heart there was a
[51:03] little bit of a flutter of how can these
[51:04] things even be,
[51:06] &gt;&gt; you know, but uh but Brother Bam said
[51:09] the only thing she had to have was God's
[51:11] word.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; That's all she had to have.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And he said that's all we have to have.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; God said so and that settles it with me.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Said, "What about you? What about you
[51:23] tonight? Believe it. Take him at his
[51:25] word and say it so and just go ahead.
[51:29] That's all you have to have is his word.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother brother brother Andrew
[51:34] preached it so eloquently and it's bound
[51:36] to bring it forth. He said, "You believe
[51:38] it, brother? Stay with it." Hallelujah.
[51:41] That's right. Stay with it. It'll the
[51:43] word it will bring the results every
[51:46] time.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I have never seen it
[51:49] fail."
[51:52] He said, uh, one of the young men in the
[51:54] campground, he sent me this quote, and
[51:55] this is the part I really like here.
[51:56] When a true heart come before God and
[52:00] means business
[52:02] &gt;&gt; and takes God at his word and starts
[52:04] testifying of it and looking to the
[52:05] unseen, then God's promises always
[52:09] produce what is asked for.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. When a true heart comes before God
[52:16] and means business, how many mean
[52:18] business tonight?
[52:20] Amen. Down in your heart there. You
[52:22] know, there's a phrase you used to hear,
[52:23] you don't hear so much nowadays about
[52:26] getting serious with God. Amen. I
[52:29] appreciate the sincerity I see in in
[52:31] young people this hour. That's what
[52:33] we've come to do tonight. We're not here
[52:34] to play church.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; No, this is this is a very crucial
[52:39] moment. We're here to get serious with
[52:41] God. Coming with hearts of faith.
[52:45] Amen. believing that his word is where
[52:48] the life is, the power is. The word is
[52:50] the word has the answer. Amen. And you
[52:53] know, it's amazing how God anoints
[52:55] ministry like brother Andrew and brother
[52:57] Josh and uses them in such a such a
[52:59] powerful anointed way that that just one
[53:02] word. A man could stand here that knows
[53:04] nothing about your situation, nothing
[53:06] about what you're going through, but but
[53:08] one word
[53:09] &gt;&gt; spoken under the inspiration of the Holy
[53:11] Spirit.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. that that heavy burden that's
[53:14] laying on your heart tonight could just
[53:16] slip away in a moment. One word and you
[53:19] could never be the same.
[53:22] That kind of a power is here. It's
[53:23] laying in the word of God.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, as we as we go to the word,
[53:29] let's let's get serious with God
[53:30] tonight. Amen. Let's let's receive
[53:35] what God has for us tonight. We welcome
[53:37] brother Josh Bennett. Amen. We'll just
[53:40] bring you right to the pulpit, brother.
[53:43] How many appreciate our brother
[53:45] [Applause]
[53:47] [Music]
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:49] [Music]
[53:50] [Applause]
[53:51] [Music]
[53:58] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts
[54:00] together.
[54:02] Lord Jesus, we count it such a honor and
[54:05] a privilege to be standing here this
[54:07] evening. Lord, I just thinking about the
[54:10] parents and the confidence that they
[54:12] have and sending their children here and
[54:15] the pastors and
[54:17] Lord, even greater than that, I think
[54:19] about the great responsibility,
[54:22] Lord, that I have as a as a as your
[54:25] servant,
[54:27] Lord, to stand before the purchase of
[54:28] your blood.
[54:31] And Lord, we certainly we know it's a
[54:34] fearful thing. And
[54:37] Lord, I I pray God that you would just
[54:40] hide me behind the cross and you'd bind
[54:43] me to your word. And Lord, I pray that
[54:46] you would open my mouth, Lord. Lord, to
[54:49] say the things that you would want to
[54:50] say. And Lord, just close my mouth to
[54:54] anything that you would not want to be
[54:56] said.
[54:58] Lord, we we're so dependent upon you.
[55:00] Lord, I need you so much right now. And
[55:04] Lord, I've recognized that I I I've come
[55:07] and I'm standing here tonight, God, and
[55:09] I realize, Lord, that I just don't have
[55:11] the ability, Lord, there's nothing that
[55:14] I could say that could change a life.
[55:17] But Lord, just one word from you can
[55:20] make all the difference. And Lord, we
[55:22] just want to yield oursel into your into
[55:24] your great hands now. And Lord, as we
[55:27] approach your word, Lord, as your
[55:29] prophet said many times, anybody that
[55:31] has the ability to read the Bible can
[55:33] open up the pages and read. But Lord, we
[55:36] want the author of the book to come.
[55:38] Lord, we're inviting you and we want you
[55:41] to be welcome, Lord. We're giving you
[55:42] the preeminence among us, Lord. Lord, we
[55:45] want to just lift you up, Lord, in the
[55:47] highest place tonight, Lord. For we
[55:49] know, God, that if you be lifted up,
[55:51] you'll draw all men unto yourself, Lord.
[55:54] And it's our desire, God, that that we
[55:56] would place you in the highest place.
[55:58] Have your way among us now. Touch every
[56:00] heart and every life as we just commit
[56:03] ourselves into your hands in Jesus
[56:06] precious name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[56:09] this evening. Amen. We just count it
[56:11] such an honor to be here once again and
[56:14] amen to be uh with you and in God's
[56:17] presence. And my what a word did we hear
[56:19] last night. Amen. We certainly uh just
[56:23] appreciate Amen. Thank you, brother.
[56:25] Amen. Just appreciate uh what God has
[56:28] spoke to us. And Amen. If you have your
[56:31] Bibles this evening, we'll just get
[56:32] right into the word. Man, I I I find out
[56:35] that especially when I'm nervous, if I
[56:38] just if I just talk, I'll get myself in
[56:40] all kind of trouble. So, I'll just get
[56:42] right into the word and Amen. We'll just
[56:44] ask the Holy Spirit to come and help us.
[56:47] Amen. But if you'd take your Bibles,
[56:48] we'll turn to the book of Revelations in
[56:50] the ninth chapter of Revelations
[56:52] tonight.
[56:54] And I want to um
[56:58] just read from the first verse. I'm
[57:01] going to read several verses here. And
[57:03] then also in the 20th chapter of the
[57:06] book of Revelations,
[57:10] Revelations chapter 9. And we'll read
[57:12] from verse number one.
[57:15] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a
[57:18] star fall from heaven unto the earth.
[57:21] And to him was given the key of the
[57:23] bottomless pit. And he opened the
[57:26] bottomless pit. And there arose a smoke
[57:28] out of the pit as a smoke of a great
[57:30] furnace. And the sun and the air were
[57:34] darkened by reason of the smoke of the
[57:36] pit. And there came out of the smoke
[57:39] locust upon the earth. And unto them was
[57:42] given power as the scorpions of the
[57:44] earth have power. And I was commanded or
[57:48] and it was commanded rather them that
[57:50] they should not hurt the grass of the
[57:52] earth, neither any green thing, neither
[57:54] any tree, but only those men which have
[57:57] not the seal of God in their foreheads.
[58:00] And to them it was given that they
[58:02] should not kill them, but that they
[58:04] should be tormented five months. And
[58:07] their torment was as the torment of a
[58:09] scorpion when he striketh a man. And in
[58:12] those days shall men seek death, and
[58:14] shall not find it, and shall desire to
[58:16] die, and death shall flee from them. And
[58:20] the shapes of the locust were like unto
[58:23] horses, prepared unto battle, and on
[58:25] their heads were as it were crowns like
[58:27] gold, and their faces were as the faces
[58:29] of men. And they had hair as the hair of
[58:33] women, and their teeth were as the teeth
[58:36] of lions, and they had breastplates as
[58:39] it were the breastplates of iron. And
[58:42] the sound of their wings was as the
[58:43] sound of chariots of many horses running
[58:45] to battle. And they had tails like unto
[58:48] scorpions, and there were stings in
[58:51] their tails, and their power was to hurt
[58:53] me in five months. And they had a king
[58:55] over them, which is the angel of the
[58:58] bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew
[59:00] tongue is Abdon. But in the Greek tongue
[59:04] hath his name Apolon.
[59:07] One woe is passed, and behold, there
[59:10] come two woes more hereafter. If we
[59:13] could turn to Revelations chapter 20,
[59:16] I'd just like to read a few verses
[59:17] there. And as you're turning there, I
[59:19] read down through those verses in
[59:22] chapter 9 to I wanted to read to verse
[59:25] 12 to show you as the Bible speaks uh
[59:28] that one woe is passed and two more it
[59:32] comes. U we know by the grace of God
[59:35] what those woes are and those woes are
[59:39] great wars upon the earth. So we know by
[59:42] that verse that this scripture is is has
[59:46] a meaning of the end times. See
[59:48] &gt;&gt; and so it it has something to do with
[59:51] even the day that we're living in. And
[59:53] and I wanted to show you that because I
[59:55] think it's very important for us to see
[59:57] in Revelations chapter 20 and we'll just
[1:00:00] read from the first verse here. And the
[1:00:02] Bible says, "And I saw an angel come
[1:00:05] down from heaven, having the key of the
[1:00:07] bottomless pit and a great chain in his
[1:00:10] hand. And he lay hold on the dragon,
[1:00:12] that old serpent, which is the devil and
[1:00:15] Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
[1:00:18] and cast him into the bottomless pit,
[1:00:20] and shut him up, and set a seal upon
[1:00:23] him, that he should deceive the nations
[1:00:25] no more, till the thousand years should
[1:00:28] be fulfilled. and after that he must be
[1:00:31] loosed a little season. May God decide
[1:00:34] his blessings as you're seated tonight.
[1:00:40] I know some of you's already thinking,
[1:00:43] uh, Brother Josh, don't you know this is
[1:00:45] a youth service
[1:00:48] and you you're reading out the book of
[1:00:50] Revelations, you know, and uh talking
[1:00:53] about things that's happening under the
[1:00:54] the the the fifth trumpet and and uh
[1:00:57] these great mysteries. But I want you to
[1:01:00] understand tonight that this is just not
[1:01:02] any youth camp.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; We are not at a Bible youth camp.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; We ain't at vacation Bible stool. You
[1:01:08] didn't come to play a few games and hear
[1:01:10] a story about Noah. But Amen. But I
[1:01:14] believe that there's some young people
[1:01:15] that I'm preaching to tonight that has
[1:01:17] the ability to understand the things of
[1:01:20] God. Amen. The the prophet of God said
[1:01:23] that the book of Revelation has more
[1:01:25] symbols in it than the rest of the books
[1:01:27] in the Bible. It has more symbols
[1:01:29] because it's a book of prophecy. It's a
[1:01:31] prophetic book and therefore it has to
[1:01:34] be understood by a prophetic class. See,
[1:01:37] the book is not meant for everybody.
[1:01:39] Amen. There's nobody that can understand
[1:01:41] it hardly. The book is made for a
[1:01:43] certain class of people. Amen. But the
[1:01:46] Bible says in Deuteronomy that the
[1:01:48] hidden things belong to the Lord. That's
[1:01:50] right. Amen. But he reveals it to us,
[1:01:52] his children. The hidden things. Amen.
[1:01:54] Actually, Brother Brham is quoting this
[1:01:56] scripture. The secret things belong unto
[1:01:58] the Lord our God. But the things which
[1:02:01] are revealed belong to us and to our
[1:02:04] children. Amen. Do you believe that?
[1:02:07] Amen. And so I just want to say this. I
[1:02:09] want to start the service by saying this
[1:02:11] tonight. This message belongs to you.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking to the young people
[1:02:15] tonight. This message belongs to you.
[1:02:18] Amen. Don't let nobody talk you out of
[1:02:20] it or take it away from you. Amen. I'll
[1:02:22] admit this. Anything that's hidden
[1:02:24] belongs to the Lord. But the things that
[1:02:26] are revealed belongs to us. Amen. It
[1:02:30] it's it's our right to it. Amen. Do do
[1:02:32] you believe that tonight? Amen. So, as
[1:02:34] we look at this, I want to just speak
[1:02:36] just for the next few minutes on the key
[1:02:39] to the bottomless pit. And I I hope by
[1:02:42] the grace of God that that God will help
[1:02:44] us. But but you see here in in in the
[1:02:48] scripture that you know uh um uh in in
[1:02:51] Revelations 9, you'll see uh uh when the
[1:02:53] fifth angel sounded that there was a
[1:02:55] star that's falling out of heaven. Amen.
[1:02:58] He's he's fallen to the earth and it was
[1:03:01] given to him the key of the bottomless
[1:03:03] pit. Now, amen. you you we're going to
[1:03:05] find out uh as we go that that that the
[1:03:08] prophet is going to identify who this
[1:03:10] star is and he's going to do it by the
[1:03:12] scripture and he's going to go back to
[1:03:14] Isaiah and he's amen how art thou fallen
[1:03:17] oh Lucifer amen he's going to show us
[1:03:19] who this is but as we see amen this star
[1:03:22] falling out of heaven you'll notice that
[1:03:25] he is given something now you're going
[1:03:26] to you see this all through the
[1:03:28] scripture Satan is given a bow he's amen
[1:03:31] in Revelation 6 he's given a sword even
[1:03:33] he's he's given a lot of things but but
[1:03:36] you know uh none of them things belong
[1:03:38] to him but it's given to him amen and
[1:03:40] it's given to him for a purpose amen but
[1:03:43] you see as he falls down out of heaven
[1:03:45] it it was given unto him a key to the
[1:03:48] bottomless pit and he's going to take
[1:03:50] that key and open something up amen but
[1:03:52] I I want to just make this point before
[1:03:55] I go any further because amen the
[1:03:57] prophet preaches a message in 1962
[1:03:59] called the key to the door and he
[1:04:01] actually uses Revelations chapter 20.
[1:04:04] Amen. And the and the angel that come
[1:04:06] down from heaven with a key, amen, to to
[1:04:09] the bottomless pit. And he uses that as
[1:04:11] a as a text and he preaches a key to the
[1:04:13] door. And and and as brother Bram is
[1:04:15] speaking on that, he said, "I saw an
[1:04:17] angel come down from heaven having the
[1:04:19] key of the bottomless pit and a great
[1:04:21] train uh uh chain in his hand." He said,
[1:04:22] "I want to take for a text if I call
[1:04:25] this," Amen. or draw a context from this
[1:04:27] text. Amen. I would like to call it the
[1:04:30] key to the door. And now I don't wish to
[1:04:32] make it keys. Amen. Because Peter was
[1:04:35] given the keys to the kingdom. But I
[1:04:37] want to call this the key to the door.
[1:04:39] Amen. And now a key. Amen. If we notice
[1:04:42] here as we read this, an angel come down
[1:04:44] from heaven having a key in his hand. I
[1:04:46] believe in Revelations 13, but I I
[1:04:49] believe brother Brown was referring to
[1:04:50] Revelations 9. He said we find again
[1:04:52] another angel coming with a key. Amen.
[1:04:55] And a key, a purpose of a key is to
[1:04:57] unlock something that's been locked up.
[1:05:00] Amen. Or is something that should be
[1:05:03] locked up. So, but a key is given for
[1:05:05] that purpose. And and then he makes a
[1:05:07] point that a key cannot unlock the door
[1:05:09] with itself, but it takes a hand to hold
[1:05:12] the key. Amen. In other words, amen.
[1:05:14] Somebody has to take amen and use the
[1:05:17] key before the key could actually do
[1:05:19] anything or be any good. Amen. And and
[1:05:22] brother B would say, Amen. And uh he
[1:05:24] said uh uh in the stature of a perfect
[1:05:26] man referring back to the key to the
[1:05:28] door. He said I preached on the key and
[1:05:30] the key is faith. And faith holds the
[1:05:33] key, amen, to the scripture. Now, now
[1:05:36] we're talking about the another key, the
[1:05:38] key of faith, amen, which holds the key
[1:05:40] to the scripture. Amen. How many
[1:05:42] believes that the power is in the word?
[1:05:46] Amen. But but there's got to be
[1:05:47] something to unlock that. Amen. So the
[1:05:50] prophet said, "The key that unlocks the
[1:05:52] power of the word is faith." Amen.
[1:05:55] Therefore, Amen. The prophet said, "I
[1:05:57] believe that the full gospel, every word
[1:05:59] of God that turns the power of God
[1:06:01] loose, it turns his blessings to the
[1:06:04] people. It's the key to the door that
[1:06:06] unlocks it." Amen. Now, I just say this.
[1:06:09] It don't matter whose hand holds the
[1:06:12] key. As long as you got a hand that can
[1:06:14] hold the key, enough strength in your
[1:06:16] hand, amen, to take the key, put it in
[1:06:18] the lock and turn it, amen, that key
[1:06:20] will do just the same for you as it did
[1:06:22] for anybody else. Now, that's that's
[1:06:25] important for you to see because Amen. I
[1:06:27] believe, amen. Amen. That God sent us a
[1:06:30] message in this day that revealed to us
[1:06:32] a key that will unlock, Amen. every
[1:06:35] promise that's in the Bible.
[1:06:38] And I believe that not only did God send
[1:06:40] it, but he actually showed us by
[1:06:42] example. Amen. Somebody actually used
[1:06:45] the key and unlocked the potential that
[1:06:47] laid in the word of God. Amen. But what
[1:06:50] I want you to see tonight, if you could
[1:06:52] ever get the same key in your hand,
[1:06:54] it'll do the same thing for you that it
[1:06:57] did for anybody else. Amen. You just
[1:07:00] have to take the key. Amen. Because it's
[1:07:02] the key that unlocks the door. Oh my. I
[1:07:06] believe that with all my heart. Amen.
[1:07:07] And and now the prophet would say this
[1:07:09] in that message. He said, you know, a
[1:07:11] key that locks also unlocks. See, you
[1:07:15] can loose or bind. That's right. Amen.
[1:07:17] This same key that unlocks, the key
[1:07:19] unlocks can lock up. See, just exactly
[1:07:22] because it works both ways.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we just go back to our
[1:07:28] scripture, Amen. We see a a a star
[1:07:32] falling from heaven. He's given a key.
[1:07:35] Amen. To open the bottomless pit. Now, I
[1:07:38] just want to start by uh uh finding out
[1:07:41] what is the bottomless pit. Amen. It's
[1:07:44] mentioned seven times by that name in
[1:07:46] the Bible. Three times in Revelations 9.
[1:07:48] Then again in Revelations 11. Amen. You
[1:07:51] find it mentioned again. Amen. You'll
[1:07:53] find it also in Revelation 17. There was
[1:07:56] a beast that ascended out of the
[1:07:58] bottomless pit and goes into predition.
[1:08:00] Amen. And twice more. You'll find it in
[1:08:02] Revelations 20. Now the same Greek word
[1:08:05] is used also in the book of Luke in Luke
[1:08:07] chapter 8 when Jesus uh uh comes to the
[1:08:10] uh the man that had allegiance of devils
[1:08:12] in him. Amen. That that those demons
[1:08:15] that was in that man actually uh called
[1:08:18] out amen to Jesus and said please don't
[1:08:21] send us into the deep. Amen. And that
[1:08:24] word deep there is the same Greek word
[1:08:26] that is used for the bottomless pit. And
[1:08:28] the reason that I wanted to show you
[1:08:30] this is because amen I believe that we
[1:08:32] can say by the authority of the word and
[1:08:34] the message of the hour that the
[1:08:35] bottomless pit is hell. It's it's
[1:08:39] speaking of a place amen that we would
[1:08:42] call hell or the regions of a loss. Now
[1:08:44] we got to understand this because hell
[1:08:46] is not just a burning blazing place.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just something like the
[1:08:52] Amen. that maybe the denominational
[1:08:53] world has made hell just a a a place of
[1:08:56] fire or whatever it may be. Amen. But do
[1:08:58] you know that the scripture speaks of
[1:09:00] what we would call the regions of the
[1:09:02] lost? A place where there's weeping and
[1:09:04] whailing and nashing of teeth. There's
[1:09:06] there's a place of torment. A place amen
[1:09:09] a dimension if we could call it that. A
[1:09:12] dimension. Amen. Amen. And the prophet
[1:09:14] of God in the in the in the sermon why
[1:09:16] we are not a denomination. He said the
[1:09:18] beast that thou saw Amen. that was and
[1:09:20] is not and shall be ascended out of the
[1:09:22] bottomless pit goes into predition.
[1:09:24] Amen. And they that dwell upon the earth
[1:09:26] will wonder whose names were not written
[1:09:28] in the book, amen, of life from the
[1:09:30] foundational world. See, there's going
[1:09:31] to be a bunch on the earth. In other
[1:09:33] words, there that's going to be
[1:09:35] deceived. For he deceived them. And
[1:09:38] there was only one group that was not
[1:09:40] deceived, and that was those that had
[1:09:42] their names on the book of life from the
[1:09:44] foundation of the world. How many
[1:09:46] thankful tonight that your name is on
[1:09:48] that book?
[1:09:50] Amen. And he goeth into predition. Now,
[1:09:52] anyone knows that predition means hell.
[1:09:55] And watch, he ascended out of hell.
[1:09:58] Amen. And he goes into Amen. Or the
[1:10:01] bottomless pit. Amen. And what is this
[1:10:03] bottom bottomless pit? Now, the
[1:10:04] prophet's going to help us right here.
[1:10:06] He said, "It's something that has no
[1:10:08] foundation."
[1:10:11] Now, I'm amazed at what Brother Brown
[1:10:13] did because he went straight from that
[1:10:14] and says, "You'll notice that Catholic
[1:10:16] doctrine ain't got no foundation."
[1:10:20] Now, I want to tell you, there's a lot
[1:10:21] of teachings and there's a lot of ideas.
[1:10:23] Amen. And they might sound good. Amen.
[1:10:25] And they might look good and Amen. But I
[1:10:27] tell you, the trouble is is it ain't got
[1:10:30] no foundation.
[1:10:32] Amen. But I want to encourage you with
[1:10:33] this tonight. Amen. The message that we
[1:10:36] follow, Amen, has got a foundation.
[1:10:40] Friends, we are not following cunningly
[1:10:42] devised fables tonight. Amen. And this
[1:10:45] ain't just a bunch of thought up ideas,
[1:10:47] but the message of the hour has a
[1:10:49] scriptural foundation.
[1:10:51] It's a place that you can stand.
[1:10:55] Hallelujah. You can rest your soul on
[1:10:56] it, brother, because there's a
[1:10:58] foundation to it. I tell you what,
[1:11:00] there's a lot of people believing a lot
[1:11:02] of things and they're on their way to a
[1:11:03] place that ain't got no foundation. But
[1:11:06] my Bible says, Amen, that the there was
[1:11:08] some people in the Bible that were
[1:11:10] looking for a city that had foundation.
[1:11:13] Hallelujah. And I tell you this tonight,
[1:11:16] I believe I'm looking at some people
[1:11:18] that's believe in a word that's got a
[1:11:20] foundation and it's going to take us to
[1:11:22] a city where it's got a foundation.
[1:11:28] Hallelujah.
[1:11:31] We know where we're standing at. Amen.
[1:11:33] We know where we're standing on.
[1:11:35] Amen. Because I tell you this, Jesus
[1:11:37] said, Amen. upon this rock. Amen. The
[1:11:41] rock of revelation will I build my
[1:11:43] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:11:46] prevail against it.
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:51] Hallelujah. Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:11:54] It ain't got no foundation. See? Amen.
[1:11:57] This bottomless pit now. Amen. It's
[1:12:00] speaking of hell. Not just a burning,
[1:12:02] blazing fire. Amen. But but but a place,
[1:12:06] a region of the lost. Now, you know,
[1:12:08] Brother Brandham, after he had been shot
[1:12:10] while he was hunting, when he was just a
[1:12:12] boy, he he went in vision. He he went to
[1:12:16] this place
[1:12:18] and and and and if it's all right, I'll
[1:12:20] just share with you some of what he se
[1:12:22] seen there. He said, "And in this time I
[1:12:24] had a vision and I had passed from this
[1:12:27] life into into
[1:12:30] the vision struck me, I was so weak and
[1:12:33] I had lost all that blood and and I was
[1:12:37] sinking into an endless eternity. And I
[1:12:40] thought I was just going through the
[1:12:41] clouds and then through darkness and
[1:12:43] sinking on down, down, down." And the
[1:12:46] first thing you know, I got into the
[1:12:48] regions of the lost and I I I began to
[1:12:51] scream and I looked and there just
[1:12:53] everything there was no foundation to
[1:12:55] it.
[1:12:57] There was no foundation to it. I just
[1:13:00] couldn't stop falling. Amen. It looked
[1:13:02] like I was just going to fall and there
[1:13:04] was no stopping nowhere. And then what a
[1:13:07] difference it was from the vision I h
[1:13:09] had here not long ago of being in glory
[1:13:12] with the people. Amen. You see the
[1:13:14] contrast. But in this, I I was just
[1:13:16] falling. And finally, I screamed for my
[1:13:18] daddy. Of course, being just a kid,
[1:13:21] amen, that's what I would do. And I
[1:13:22] screamed for my daddy, but my daddy
[1:13:24] wasn't there. I screamed for my mother.
[1:13:27] Amen. I I wanted somebody to catch me,
[1:13:28] but there was no mother there. I I I
[1:13:31] just going and I screamed out to God.
[1:13:33] Amen. But God, there was nothing. There
[1:13:35] was no God wasn't there. There was just
[1:13:37] nothing there. And after a while, I
[1:13:39] heard the most mournful sound that I
[1:13:41] ever heard. Amen. And it was the
[1:13:43] awfulest feeling. There was just no way.
[1:13:45] Amen. Even a literal burning fire would
[1:13:47] have been a pleasure by the side of what
[1:13:49] this was. And I heard a noise and it
[1:13:52] sounded like some kind of haunted
[1:13:54] affair. And when I looked coming, it was
[1:13:57] women and they had this green stuff just
[1:14:00] just on their face and and and a and
[1:14:02] under their eyes. And their eyes look
[1:14:05] like they run back like women today
[1:14:07] paint their eyes just run back like that
[1:14:09] and just on their on their face. and and
[1:14:12] they were going, "Ooh, oh my." I just
[1:14:15] screamed out, "Oh God, have mercy upon
[1:14:17] me. Have mercy, oh God, where are you?
[1:14:20] If if you'll only let me go back and
[1:14:22] live, I promise I'll be a good boy."
[1:14:24] Amen. That's the only thing I could say.
[1:14:26] Amen. And then in a moment's time, amen,
[1:14:29] I was back to natural life again. And
[1:14:31] the thing has bothered me. And I
[1:14:33] thought, "Oh, let it be that I'll never
[1:14:35] go to a place like that." And no other
[1:14:37] human being will ever have to go to a
[1:14:39] place like that. And I knew that there
[1:14:42] was a region of the dam somewhere. You
[1:14:45] see, this is a prophet by vision
[1:14:48] describing this place, a a place with no
[1:14:50] foundation, a place, amen, just falling
[1:14:53] and falling. And amen. And I I just say
[1:14:55] this, you know, I believe it's so
[1:14:58] important for us to realize, amen, that
[1:15:00] that once a a man dies and he finds
[1:15:03] himself in that place, there's there's
[1:15:05] no daddy that can help him. There's
[1:15:07] there's no mama there to help. There's,
[1:15:09] even God at that time. Amen. Because God
[1:15:12] has given you an opportunity like you
[1:15:14] heard preach here last night. Amen.
[1:15:16] Today is the day of salvation. Amen. God
[1:15:19] has gave us a space to repent. I tell
[1:15:21] you this tonight. Amen. Hey, you may
[1:15:23] feel like you're falling tonight. Amen.
[1:15:25] But I tell you, as long as there's
[1:15:27] breath in your body, there's a hand that
[1:15:29] can reach down and catch you. Amen. You
[1:15:31] can be delivered, amen, from that that
[1:15:34] place. Amen. But friends, there's a time
[1:15:36] coming when there be no hell for it.
[1:15:40] You see what I'm saying? Now, I I want
[1:15:43] to just move forward with this because
[1:15:45] Amen. I I want to get to the point of my
[1:15:47] message. But we find this angel. So, now
[1:15:50] we understand what the bottomless pit
[1:15:51] is. And there's an angel come or a star
[1:15:55] rather that's fell from heaven. Amen.
[1:15:58] And he's got a key and he's going to
[1:16:00] open up this bottomless pit and
[1:16:04] something's going to come out of it.
[1:16:06] See? Amen. Is it okay if I just say what
[1:16:09] a prophet said? He said, "Brother, the
[1:16:11] lid has come off of hell."
[1:16:15] The lid has come off of hell. Amen. all
[1:16:19] and the streams of demon power is
[1:16:22] pounding or pouring in from everywhere.
[1:16:24] It's conquered the nations. It's
[1:16:26] conquered politics. Amen. Until it's
[1:16:29] just rotten to the core. It's conquered
[1:16:31] the churches until they know nothing but
[1:16:33] denomination. You say, "Are you a
[1:16:35] Christian?" "I'm a Methodist." Or, "Are
[1:16:37] you a Christian? I'm a Pentecostal."
[1:16:39] That don't mean no more. Amen. Than
[1:16:41] nothing. As I said the other day, that
[1:16:43] don't mean no uh no more. Amen. than a a
[1:16:46] a pig or a hog or a horse or something.
[1:16:49] Amen. It has nothing to do with it.
[1:16:51] You're a Christian when you're born
[1:16:52] again and filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:55] And not until that. Amen. And you're
[1:16:58] yielded completely to the spirit. If
[1:17:00] you're not yielded to the spirit, then
[1:17:02] you're not born again. And you don't
[1:17:05] have the Holy Ghost. You might speak in
[1:17:07] tongues and shiver and jump and run and
[1:17:09] do all kind of things. Paul said, "I can
[1:17:11] move mountains with faith. I can heal
[1:17:13] the sick. I can have knowledge." Amen. I
[1:17:15] could go to a seminary and learn all
[1:17:17] this stuff and everything and yet I'm
[1:17:19] nothing. Oh my. You talk about the lid
[1:17:21] off the kettle. Amen. And demons going
[1:17:24] around and the powers of the devil under
[1:17:26] the name of Christianity teaching for
[1:17:28] doctrine the commandments of men
[1:17:31] theological seminary doctrines leaving
[1:17:33] the Bible alone. And who is able? Who's
[1:17:36] strong enough? Who's wise enough? who's
[1:17:40] powerful enough to tame this legion
[1:17:43] that's stripping the clothes off of our
[1:17:45] women. Amen. In the in the preachers,
[1:17:48] Methodists, Amen. Baptist, Pentecostals.
[1:17:50] Amen. These women painting their faces
[1:17:52] like Jezebels, bobbing their hair,
[1:17:54] wearing pants just like men. And our
[1:17:56] preachers ain't got enough get up about
[1:17:58] them to tell them about it.
[1:18:01] It's demon possession.
[1:18:04] It was a legion that tore off the
[1:18:06] clothes of the man. Amen. Who is this
[1:18:09] roaring devil? And who's strong enough?
[1:18:12] What kind What kind of denomination is
[1:18:14] able to conquer him walking up and down
[1:18:17] through these tombstones? A denomination
[1:18:19] is crying the days of miracles has
[1:18:21] passed. And we don't need the Holy
[1:18:23] Ghost. Who can tame that devil? Oh God,
[1:18:26] we can't do it by denomination. We can't
[1:18:28] do it by ecclesiastical forces. But
[1:18:31] there was a voice one time that did it.
[1:18:34] Hallelujah. There was a voice that tamed
[1:18:36] them devils and put them right. Amen.
[1:18:39] Put the man right in his right mind. I
[1:18:41] tell you what voice did it? It was the
[1:18:43] voice of our Lord.
[1:18:47] Hallelujah. The question is tonight, who
[1:18:49] is going to tame, Amen, these spirits of
[1:18:51] Leosa? Amen. These evil spirits been the
[1:18:55] spirits of fashion that's come through
[1:18:58] Hollywood.
[1:19:00] Come on, church. I want to just tell
[1:19:01] you, I know it's youth camp. Amen. But I
[1:19:03] still believe in preaching the gospel.
[1:19:05] Amen. I believe that the gospel is a
[1:19:08] closline gospel. Amen. It's a gospel of
[1:19:10] holiness.
[1:19:12] I believe God's bride is going to be a
[1:19:14] holy bride. I believe that the church of
[1:19:17] the living God will be a clean church.
[1:19:22] I say God give us some men, amen, with a
[1:19:25] backbone enough to stand and preach it
[1:19:27] the way the prophet said it, the way the
[1:19:30] Bible says it.
[1:19:32] But the Bible says that a woman
[1:19:34] shouldn't cut her hair. And if she does,
[1:19:36] she Oh, come on, church. Do you know
[1:19:38] that this Bible teaches us, Amen. If a
[1:19:40] woman bs her hair off, God will not even
[1:19:43] hear a prayer.
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; But the spirits of the end time have got
[1:19:50] so powerful and strong until somebody
[1:19:53] will come and a preacher will come and
[1:19:55] explain that away and water it down and
[1:19:57] say, "I don't really mean that.
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:04] Come on. And then you see them things
[1:20:06] slipping right into the church.
[1:20:11] And
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; somebody said, "Well, you know, I I just
[1:20:13] don't want to hurt nobody's feelings."
[1:20:14] Well, I just say it the way I believe
[1:20:16] it. I'd rather have my feelings hurt
[1:20:19] now.
[1:20:23] Hey, I told my church the other day, I
[1:20:26] said if there's something in my life
[1:20:27] that ain't pleasing to God, I pray the
[1:20:29] Holy Ghost exposes me. I pray that the
[1:20:32] spirit of God will send a man to the
[1:20:34] pull pit and expose that thing in my
[1:20:36] life. It might embarrass me, but I'd
[1:20:39] rather be embarrassed now and make it.
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:48] Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:20:55] prophet said we you know who's going to
[1:20:57] be able to stand against it? Who who
[1:20:59] what power what power will be able to
[1:21:02] withstand these spirits? Hell has been
[1:21:05] opened up. The lid is lifted off of it
[1:21:08] and demon powers are striking from every
[1:21:10] side. And who's going to be able to
[1:21:12] stand? And he said your denomination
[1:21:14] won't do it. Amen. Your church won't do
[1:21:17] it. Come on church. I want to tell you.
[1:21:19] Amen. Just being a good church member
[1:21:20] ain't going to cut it. Just paying ti
[1:21:23] and having good church attendance, that
[1:21:25] ain't going to do it. Going to youth
[1:21:27] camp once or twice a year, that ain't
[1:21:29] going to do it, friends. Ain't got one
[1:21:30] power that'll withstand amen the spirits
[1:21:33] of this age, and that's the power of the
[1:21:35] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:38] Hallelujah. I tell you friends, it is
[1:21:40] not an option tonight. Amen. You either
[1:21:42] are born again and filled with the
[1:21:45] spirit of God or you ain't going in the
[1:21:47] rapture.
[1:21:48] Ain't no side doors. Ain't no shortcuts.
[1:21:51] There ain't no other way.
[1:22:02] I promise we see in this age we're
[1:22:04] living in how can I overcome? Amen. We
[1:22:06] see in this age we're living that one of
[1:22:07] the grandest ages of all the ages. The
[1:22:10] Leo sin church age. The greatest of all
[1:22:11] the church age because Amen. It's the
[1:22:13] ending of time and the blending of
[1:22:15] eternity. It's a great but and then it's
[1:22:18] the greatest sinful age
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; that there's ever been
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; and the powers of Satan is many times
[1:22:26] harder to fight against than it had been
[1:22:29] in any age.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; That's why I I I want to stand here
[1:22:35] tonight.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this. I believe I'm
[1:22:37] looking at a at a generation
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; and some of you parents that are here
[1:22:42] and and some of you that's sitting in
[1:22:44] the back, you got to realize this. You
[1:22:45] say, "Well, I was a kid one time, too."
[1:22:47] And we were, and we had battles, and we
[1:22:50] still got battles.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; But I tell you this, these kids are
[1:22:53] fighting battles you never fought.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And the powers of the enemy that's that
[1:22:59] has been released upon them is greater
[1:23:00] than anything we've ever faced.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; But I will say this with great
[1:23:04] confidence. The same way I overcome, you
[1:23:06] can too.
[1:23:08] The same God, hallelujah, the same power
[1:23:12] of the Holy Ghost, the same Ray Ericson.
[1:23:15] Amen. That kept him all these years and
[1:23:18] he's still standing here tonight.
[1:23:21] Come on, church. If God did it in Ray
[1:23:23] Eric, if he did it in Wayne Lawson, if
[1:23:26] he done it in Matthew McGary and he done
[1:23:28] it in me, he'll do it in you, too. The
[1:23:31] power of the enemy might be greater, but
[1:23:33] the power of the Holy Ghost is greater
[1:23:36] still.
[1:23:39] Where sin did abound, grace did much
[1:23:43] more abound.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I want you to catch this though. The pit
[1:23:56] is open.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, is there is is is
[1:24:02] it okay if I show you something here?
[1:24:04] Because a prophet one Amen. was sitting
[1:24:07] in a department store,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; JC Penneyy's part department store
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; and he began to see a scene
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; and brother David when he saw those
[1:24:19] women and I want you to understand
[1:24:20] something tonight friends I ain't
[1:24:22] preaching against the people
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; it's the spirit
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:28] I tell you what if you if you if you get
[1:24:30] looking down your nose at people in this
[1:24:32] world amen you're on a bad path cuz if
[1:24:35] not for the grace of God there I be. If
[1:24:38] it weren't for the grace of God, there
[1:24:40] would you be. Amen. We would all be
[1:24:42] there tonight. It ain't the people, it's
[1:24:44] the spirit. And the prophet of God was
[1:24:46] looking at them women as they was coming
[1:24:47] off that escalator and and he said,
[1:24:49] "Wait a minute. I think I saw this
[1:24:52] before
[1:24:54] and something come to his mind or his
[1:24:56] memory." Amen. God brought something to
[1:24:58] his memory that the same thing the same
[1:25:00] thing he saw in hell, he saw on the
[1:25:02] earth.
[1:25:04] Why? Because the influence, amen, of
[1:25:07] that dimension had pressed his way into
[1:25:09] this dimension. Because a lid of hell
[1:25:12] has been torn off, the pin has opened
[1:25:15] up.
[1:25:18] And what a prophet saw in hell, he saw
[1:25:20] right on the earth.
[1:25:22] Listen to me, sisters. That'll tell you
[1:25:24] right there. Amen. Where all this
[1:25:25] makeup's coming from.
[1:25:28] And when you put it on, the influence
[1:25:30] that you're under.
[1:25:33] And what kingdom are you reflecting?
[1:25:36] Come on, church. Amen. You know it's the
[1:25:38] truth tonight. Amen. But I tell you
[1:25:40] what, I got to thinking about that in my
[1:25:42] room today. And I was thinking about a
[1:25:44] prophet sitting in JC Penney. Amen. And
[1:25:46] he saw a scene and he said, Amen. I
[1:25:48] wait. I saw this before. And I got to
[1:25:50] thinking about this and I thought, I
[1:25:52] wonder if that prophet could come to
[1:25:53] this camp. And he sat on this platform
[1:25:56] and look out of this audience. Amen. I
[1:25:58] wonder if he could say something like
[1:26:00] this. Wait just a minute. I think I saw
[1:26:03] this somewhere before
[1:26:05] because the same prophet that went to
[1:26:08] the fifth dimension went to the sixth
[1:26:10] dimension.
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:13] Hallelujah. And I'll tell you what he
[1:26:15] saw over there. He saw a bunch of young
[1:26:17] people.
[1:26:19] Oh, some of them is old when they die.
[1:26:23] But when he saw they were young and they
[1:26:26] were clothed in the beauty of holiness
[1:26:30] and they were resting on the message
[1:26:32] that he preached.
[1:26:34] And I believe that if he was here
[1:26:36] tonight, he could look out at this
[1:26:37] audience and say, "Wait a minute. I saw
[1:26:40] this character before. I heard this
[1:26:42] testimony before. Because what I saw
[1:26:45] over there, I'm seeing a reflection of
[1:26:47] it here.
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:55] Hallelujah. I just get ahead of myself
[1:26:57] and go ahead and say this. All hell's
[1:26:59] been turned loose, but friends, heaven
[1:27:01] has come down.
[1:27:07] There's another influence that's been
[1:27:09] released in this age by another star. He
[1:27:13] wasn't a fallen star. He was the seven
[1:27:16] star that was held in the hand
[1:27:20] of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Listen friends,
[1:27:40] hell
[1:27:42] is on the earth.
[1:27:47] I don't know about the rest of y'all,
[1:27:49] but sometimes I feel like I'm living in
[1:27:51] it.
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; You know, right now you're in youth camp
[1:27:57] and you're in a meeting, man. You're
[1:27:59] surrounded by believers and
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit's a reality. And
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're sheltered and protected and
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; but you go to Walmart or you go, "Hey,
[1:28:12] you ain't got to go very far. just pump
[1:28:13] gas in your car.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Them influences are everywhere.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; It's coming from every side. And the
[1:28:23] prophets of God identified. He said the
[1:28:25] lid of hell has been tore up. It's been
[1:28:27] lifted off.
[1:28:29] You can see it right in the Bible. Even
[1:28:31] the timeline of it is revealed to us.
[1:28:33] Amen. That in between the first and
[1:28:35] second wo, there's something that's
[1:28:36] going to be released
[1:28:38] upon the earth.
[1:28:43] I'll just say it this way. If you feel
[1:28:45] comfortable here, there's an altar here
[1:28:48] tonight.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And I'd come and weep my way to Calvary.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Because I want to tell you, if ain't a
[1:28:56] cry in your heart, even so, come Lord
[1:28:58] Jesus. Amen. We ought to be realizing
[1:29:01] greater than ever, this world is not our
[1:29:03] home. Amen. This place ain't even know
[1:29:06] where it ain't even fit for a believer
[1:29:07] to live in anymore. friends, we're
[1:29:09] looking for a way of escape. There's got
[1:29:11] to be a way out of this. Amen. But I was
[1:29:14] pondering on that, too. And I got to
[1:29:15] thinking, you know what? I might feel
[1:29:17] like I'm in hell now. But I got good
[1:29:19] news for you. Amen. Some of y'all that's
[1:29:21] been born again and filled with the Holy
[1:29:22] Ghost, this is the only hell you ever
[1:29:24] going to experience.
[1:29:26] Hallelujah. This is the only taste of it
[1:29:29] that you're ever going to get. I just
[1:29:32] tell the devil tonight, you better do
[1:29:33] what you can, oh boy. Amen. Because I
[1:29:36] tell you right now, Amen. I'm leaving
[1:29:38] here. Amen. One day, very soon.
[1:29:42] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to be
[1:29:44] delivered
[1:29:47] from this wicked world.
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:57] But it's a reality, church. This is
[1:29:58] where we're living at.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's a day we're living in.
[1:30:06] You know the even under the revelation
[1:30:08] of this the opening of the seals we seen
[1:30:11] the antichrist
[1:30:14] riding on four horses
[1:30:16] same rider the whole time as a spirit
[1:30:18] antichrist spirit worn against the
[1:30:20] church
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; white horse red horse black horse that
[1:30:23] pale horse was a mixture of all of it
[1:30:25] together and how many knows that the
[1:30:27] name of the rider was identified and and
[1:30:30] the Bible says that hell followed His
[1:30:34] name is death and hell followed.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? I know, amen.
[1:30:38] That you know, Satan is not fully
[1:30:41] incarnated, making his full ride at this
[1:30:43] time. But friends, the pale horse is
[1:30:45] already riding.
[1:30:48] Amen. We ain't fighting a white horse.
[1:30:50] We ain't fighting. Come on, friends.
[1:30:52] Amen. That pale horse of death is
[1:30:54] already rid. And spiritual death is
[1:30:56] striking the land. Last plague struck
[1:30:59] Egypt was death. last plague that will
[1:31:01] strike the the the terror of the world.
[1:31:03] Amen. Is spiritual death before the
[1:31:06] Exodus. How many believe that's true?
[1:31:08] Amen. And that is already happening. You
[1:31:10] say, "Oh, brother, what are you trying
[1:31:12] to say?" I'm trying to say, tell you
[1:31:13] this. There's people that are living and
[1:31:15] breathing. There's people sitting on
[1:31:17] church pews that are dead as they can
[1:31:19] be.
[1:31:22] You say, "Oh, brother, you're going to
[1:31:24] have to show me that in the B." Okay.
[1:31:25] The woman that sinnth is dead while she
[1:31:29] yet liveth.
[1:31:32] There's people that are dying
[1:31:34] spiritually.
[1:31:36] Amen. And the prophet of God said, "What
[1:31:38] follows death?" Hell always follows
[1:31:40] death. And he's showing you something in
[1:31:43] the scripture that hell has been
[1:31:44] released in this age. Death is riding
[1:31:47] and hell is following.
[1:31:51] But I got some good news. When the enemy
[1:31:54] comes in like a flood, the spirit of
[1:31:58] God,
[1:32:00] raises a standard.
[1:32:04] Hallelujah. And when that white horse,
[1:32:06] Amen, went out, God raised up a
[1:32:08] standard. There was an anointing of a
[1:32:10] lie that was released upon the people to
[1:32:13] withstand that Antichrist spirit. When
[1:32:15] the red horse went out, there was an
[1:32:17] anointing of an ox that was released to
[1:32:20] withstand amen that in that martyr age.
[1:32:23] Amen. In the in the black horse, amen,
[1:32:25] with a pair of bounces in his hand, it
[1:32:27] was anointing of a man that was released
[1:32:29] in that age to combat and withstand that
[1:32:32] spirit. But in this age,
[1:32:34] when death is riding and a pale horse is
[1:32:37] going out, there's a flying eagle.
[1:32:42] Hallelujah. Friends, every one of them
[1:32:44] other creatures were earthbound
[1:32:46] creatures, but when it come to the
[1:32:48] eagle, it was a flying eagle. Because
[1:32:51] this anointing is not just going to
[1:32:53] anoint you to survive this age.
[1:32:57] This anointing didn't just come to help
[1:32:59] you just to make it through. But this is
[1:33:03] a rapture anointing.
[1:33:05] This is an overcoming anointing. Amen.
[1:33:07] That will absolutely defeat the enemy
[1:33:12] and lift you up above.
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:33:29] Now think about this cuz
[1:33:33] under this in this in this in this
[1:33:36] revelations 9,
[1:33:38] brother B was saying the feast of the
[1:33:39] trumpets, he said
[1:33:44] this army. So if you continue to read on
[1:33:47] down in Revelations chapter 9, you're
[1:33:48] going to find that there was something
[1:33:51] released
[1:33:52] out of the river Euphrates.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It was actually 200,000,000
[1:33:59] horsemen.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; It gives description of them. Brother
[1:34:03] Brown comes and says ain't that many
[1:34:05] horsemen in the in the world. And look
[1:34:06] at the description that's given of them.
[1:34:08] They're supernatural demons.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Not natural horsemen. They're
[1:34:12] supernatural demons.
[1:34:15] 200 million demons
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; released into this age.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; And you can see it very clearly in
[1:34:23] history. All you got to do is study
[1:34:24] history. You'll find that them demons
[1:34:26] come upon men and their armies
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; to persecute Israel.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and the prophet of God
[1:34:36] said, "And that army had a king." And he
[1:34:39] said, "Their king was identified in
[1:34:41] Revelations 9:1, a star falling out of
[1:34:44] heaven." And then he identifies that by
[1:34:46] the scripture, "How art thou fallen, oh
[1:34:48] Lucifer?" And he said, "See, Satan
[1:34:51] himself is the king over that army
[1:34:53] coming out of the river Euphrates. 200
[1:34:56] million devils." Amen. But this is the
[1:34:58] thing you got to catch. Amen. But them
[1:35:00] same devils that got on the armies of
[1:35:02] Ikeman and Stalin and Muslin and Hitler
[1:35:05] and their armies and and persecuted the
[1:35:07] Jews and drove them back to their
[1:35:09] homeland, them same demons, the prophet
[1:35:11] said has become ecclesiastical devils.
[1:35:14] But can I just tell you to this way?
[1:35:15] Amen. When them wars was over and Israel
[1:35:17] went into their homeland, them devils
[1:35:19] didn't go back to river Euphrates. Them
[1:35:21] same demons, amen, just change a little
[1:35:24] bit and become ecclesiastical demons. He
[1:35:27] said, "And their waring been turned
[1:35:29] loose." He said, "Not against the
[1:35:31] church, against the bride of Jesus
[1:35:33] Christ." Could you imagine? Hey, this
[1:35:36] ought to help you tonight. Amen. You was
[1:35:38] wondering why it's so hard to serve God.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; You wondering why it's so hard to read
[1:35:43] your Bible and pray. You wondering why
[1:35:45] it's so hard to listen to a tape. You
[1:35:48] wonder why it's so hard to make it to
[1:35:50] church. You wonder why it's so hard even
[1:35:52] when you get here, you can't hardly lift
[1:35:54] your hand. You can't get an amen out.
[1:35:56] You wonder because all the every devil
[1:35:58] in hell is against you and there's 200
[1:36:02] million demons that is waring against
[1:36:04] the bride even right now. I want to tell
[1:36:06] you friends, don't you be mistaken.
[1:36:08] Amen. The devil is real. Spirits are
[1:36:11] real. There's a battle going on right
[1:36:13] now in this building.
[1:36:19] And Satan is trying to block you from
[1:36:22] receiving the word of God because he
[1:36:24] knows if you get a revelation
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:28] of who you are and what you stand for,
[1:36:33] hallelujah, that Satan will be just as
[1:36:36] defeated by you as he was by Jesus
[1:36:39] Christ. With the revelation of God in
[1:36:42] your heart, you will be an invincible
[1:36:45] army.
[1:36:48] So the devil's doing everything he can
[1:36:50] to block it and stop it.
[1:36:53] Oh, you know I'm telling the truth.
[1:36:55] Amen. That devil's been fighting you all
[1:36:57] week before you got here. And the battle
[1:36:59] didn't end when you got here. He's
[1:37:01] fighting you right now.
[1:37:04] But I want to tell you, amen, them
[1:37:06] devils, them 200 million devils ain't
[1:37:08] the only people fighting.
[1:37:10] That's not the only army in this
[1:37:12] building.
[1:37:14] [Applause]
[1:37:16] Hallelujah. I feel good to say this.
[1:37:19] Amen. Because the Bible numbers the
[1:37:21] devils. But over in Hebrews chapter 12,
[1:37:24] the same Bible says, amen, that we are
[1:37:27] compass them out by an innumerable
[1:37:29] company of angels.
[1:37:32] There's 200 million devils against you,
[1:37:34] but there's so many angels that you
[1:37:36] can't even number them. Friends, I want
[1:37:38] to tell you tonight, there's more for us
[1:37:41] than there is against us.
[1:37:45] Hallelujah. I'm talking about them
[1:37:48] angels that kept their first estate.
[1:37:51] Them angels that stood with Michael in
[1:37:53] heaven. Them angels that didn't believe
[1:37:56] the devil's lie. Them same angels have
[1:37:59] taken their place by your side.
[1:38:04] In the prophet of God, a man that can
[1:38:06] see in another dimension come and
[1:38:08] declare declared unto us, "This building
[1:38:11] is full of the angels tonight. The
[1:38:14] angels are here. Christ is here. The
[1:38:17] Holy Ghost is here."
[1:38:23] One place he said they're here to
[1:38:24] energize your faith.
[1:38:28] As
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; a matter of fact, Brother Bam would
[1:38:31] describe it this way. He said, "You ever
[1:38:33] Amen." I'm paraphrasing now, so y'all
[1:38:35] give me a little bit of grace. He said,
[1:38:38] "But you ever you ever, you know, been
[1:38:39] sitting in a service and you just feel
[1:38:42] something in you say hallelujah."
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You don't even know why. You just
[1:38:48] sitting there and all of a sudden, amen,
[1:38:50] the word is coming over something in
[1:38:51] your heart that says, "Amen."
[1:38:54] Amen. You didn't even mean to do it.
[1:38:57] Matter of fact, some of y'all come
[1:38:58] determined. Amen. You just come
[1:39:00] determined. I ain't I ain't getting into
[1:39:01] the service. I am not going to say,
[1:39:03] "Amen. I ain't going down this path
[1:39:05] again. I am not going to stand. I ain't
[1:39:08] going to get caught up in this excite.
[1:39:09] I'm not going to do nothing." And after
[1:39:11] just a little while, amen, you just
[1:39:13] can't even help yourself. And somehow
[1:39:15] come along and they'll say, "That's just
[1:39:16] a workout. That's just somebody. That's
[1:39:18] just this or that." But a prophet said,
[1:39:21] amen, that sometimes when you feel that
[1:39:24] urge to say amen or hallelujah or raise
[1:39:28] your hand or just stand up on your feet,
[1:39:30] he said an angel has just bucked into
[1:39:33] you.
[1:39:37] Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] Glory to God. I say this, maybe somebody
[1:39:42] got excited, but somebody else got
[1:39:45] touched by an angel.
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:50] Maybe somebody else just did it because
[1:39:53] a brother did it, but somebody else just
[1:39:56] walked into something that's so real.
[1:40:07] Hallelujah. What is that? That's the
[1:40:10] army of God
[1:40:12] coming to stand by your side.
[1:40:16] [Applause]
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:26] Let me tell you something, church.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; I ain't done yet.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Let's go. I'm going to tell you
[1:40:37] something. Amen. Them 200 million devils
[1:40:39] ain't the only things being released.
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:42] Cuz the prophet of God said in the same
[1:40:44] message, same place, he said, "And the
[1:40:47] Holy Ghost
[1:40:49] that's been bound at the doors of Crelas
[1:40:53] for 2,000 years has been loosed.
[1:40:58] Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] Oh, I want to preach right now because
[1:41:02] in Revelations 9, you see a star falling
[1:41:05] out of heaven and he's given a key. But
[1:41:08] brother, if you just keep reading your
[1:41:09] Bible, Amen. You get in the next chapter
[1:41:12] in Revelations 10, there's a mighty
[1:41:14] angel that come down.
[1:41:19] He didn't fall down. He wasn't cast
[1:41:22] down. He come down. Hallelujah. And
[1:41:26] another mighty angel come down out of
[1:41:29] heaven calling the cloud. Oh, this is
[1:41:32] And he has something in his hand. It was
[1:41:35] a book open.
[1:41:37] He was bringing a revelation.
[1:41:42] He was bringing you something to give
[1:41:44] you victory.
[1:41:48] Hallelujah. I tell you, I just let you
[1:41:51] know a little a little bit more about
[1:41:52] the p the picture. Amen. You go to
[1:41:54] Revelation 17 and 8. The Bible says a
[1:41:57] beast ascended out of the bottomless pit
[1:41:59] and goeth into predition. Brother B said
[1:42:02] he come out of hell and he goes back to
[1:42:04] hell.
[1:42:07] Amen. But when he goes, he ain't gone by
[1:42:09] himself.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; But because of deception, he'll take
[1:42:12] many with him. Because the Bible says
[1:42:15] all wondered after him that didn't have
[1:42:17] their names written in the landsburg of
[1:42:18] lie before the foundation of the world.
[1:42:20] He come out of hell. He's going back to
[1:42:22] hell. And through deception, he'll carry
[1:42:24] somebody with him. Oh, hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:28] But a mighty angel come down out of
[1:42:30] heaven. Christ come out of heaven. And
[1:42:33] friends, he's going back to heaven. But
[1:42:36] he ain't going back.
[1:42:38] [Applause]
[1:42:40] He come out of heaven and he's going
[1:42:42] back to heaven. But brother, he's taking
[1:42:45] me with him by the revelation of Malachi
[1:42:49] 4. Luke 17:30.
[1:42:52] Revelations 10:7. The message, the
[1:42:55] evening time message has loosed the Holy
[1:42:58] Spirit.
[1:43:03] Christ is back in his church.
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:15] Oh, just give him a great hand clap of
[1:43:18] praise tonight.
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:24] Hell has been opened up. Heaven has come
[1:43:28] down.
[1:43:31] The shield is off the book. We know who
[1:43:34] we are.
[1:43:36] We know where we came from. We know
[1:43:38] where we're going.
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:47] Hallelujah. This ain't a bunch of work
[1:43:49] up. This ain't a Pentecostal pump up. I
[1:43:52] want you to take notice tonight. Ain't
[1:43:54] nobody on no instrument up here. Ain't
[1:43:56] nobody beating it up, pumping it up,
[1:43:58] working it up. It's the word of God.
[1:44:00] It's the revelation
[1:44:03] that has been released in this hour.
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:07] That revelation, Amen, will conquer the
[1:44:10] devil.
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:19] I believe we showed enough of the other
[1:44:21] side to say this. Amen. Listen, friends.
[1:44:23] The chill bumps will leave. The
[1:44:25] excitement will end. camp will be over
[1:44:27] in a couple days. But if you get a
[1:44:29] revelation in your heart, all the devils
[1:44:32] in hell can't take that out of you.
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:39] If God comes down and reveals to you,
[1:44:41] amen, that this message is thus sayeth
[1:44:43] the Lord, it's a foundation. Amen. It's
[1:44:46] your grace.
[1:44:48] It's your way of escape.
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:45:00] Hallelujah.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Let me just
[1:45:18] I better
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:23] Now listen,
[1:45:26] I I spent a lot of time saying a lot of
[1:45:29] things. I don't think they were in vain,
[1:45:31] sir.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; But I I want to come to one point.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; There's a key.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Remember, brother R said the key
[1:45:45] can either unlock
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; or lock.
[1:45:51] Now, I've showed you in the Bible
[1:45:53] tonight exactly that.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. A
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; star falls out of heaven. Revelations 9,
[1:45:58] he's given a key. He opens up the
[1:46:02] bottomless pit. But in Revelations 20,
[1:46:06] the Bible says,
[1:46:08] "And I saw an angel come down from
[1:46:11] heaven having the key of the bottomless
[1:46:14] pit
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; and a great chain in his hand. And he
[1:46:17] laid hold on the dragon, that old
[1:46:19] serpent, which is the devil, and Satan,
[1:46:21] and bound him a thousand years, and cast
[1:46:25] him into the bottomless pit, and shut
[1:46:27] him up, and set a seal upon him. I want
[1:46:31] to tell you, and remember, Revelation is
[1:46:33] book of symbols. You're going to see a
[1:46:35] lot of things, and if you study the book
[1:46:37] of Revelations, you're going to see
[1:46:39] angels with with things in their hands.
[1:46:42] You'll see Christ standing in in in the
[1:46:45] first part of the book of Revelations.
[1:46:46] He got seven stars in his hands. You'll
[1:46:49] find an angel in Revelation 7 with the
[1:46:51] seal of God. You'll keep on reading.
[1:46:53] You'll see an angel with a sickle. You
[1:46:55] You see a mighty angel with an open
[1:46:57] book. You see, Amen. all these things.
[1:46:59] But now you see this angel coming down
[1:47:02] out of heaven with a key and a chain.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And he's coming for a purpose. And when
[1:47:07] he comes to he, what's he do? He lays
[1:47:09] hold.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; He lays hold on the dragon.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; I feel I feel like I need to just make
[1:47:18] this point too. Ain't this amazing? The
[1:47:20] Bible says he lay hold on the dragon
[1:47:23] one.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; That old serpent
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; two which is the devil three
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; and Satan.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know that that is talking about
[1:47:34] one
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; thing?
[1:47:36] [Applause]
[1:47:38] a dragon,
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; a serpent,
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; a devil, and Satan
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; and it's all the same thing.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; How many of you can see that?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; You know, a whole lot of people can see
[1:47:50] that. Why in the world can't they see
[1:47:52] that when you talk about father son Holy
[1:47:55] Ghost
[1:47:57] Melzdc
[1:47:59] really rose I don't care what title you
[1:48:03] give to him it's all talking about the
[1:48:05] same person and his name is the Lord
[1:48:07] Jesus Christ come on tree that is a
[1:48:10] revelation that will defeat the devil
[1:48:12] right there and I tell you I'm so glad
[1:48:14] that when you young people get on your
[1:48:15] knees and pray you ain't wondering who
[1:48:17] to pray to or which God to call upon. on
[1:48:20] or which name to use or if you're going
[1:48:22] through depression, I got to pray to
[1:48:24] this certain saint. Or if I'm sick, I
[1:48:26] got to pray to somebody. Come on,
[1:48:28] church. Amen. If you just call on the
[1:48:30] name of Jesus, he's Jehovah Gyra. He's
[1:48:34] Jehovah Shalom. He's Jehovah Tu. He's
[1:48:37] your peace. He's your battle.
[1:48:42] Hallelujah.
[1:48:44] He's Jesus Christ. The same yesterday,
[1:48:47] today, and forever.
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:56] Hallelujah.
[1:48:58] But this angel comes down. He's got a
[1:49:00] key
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; and a chain.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I got to say this before I go
[1:49:05] any further.
[1:49:07] This scripture is speaking of the
[1:49:08] millennium.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; How many understands? I want to just be
[1:49:11] real clear.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; This scripture is speaking of the
[1:49:14] millennium.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are not in the millennium.
[1:49:18] But nevertheless,
[1:49:20] amen. You got to understand the point
[1:49:24] that a key is being revealed
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; and it's a key that opens and shuts.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; And the key already exists.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. The key already exists.
[1:49:40] There's coming a time in the future
[1:49:42] that's that that an angel's going to
[1:49:43] come down and bind Satan for a
[1:49:47] millennium. and he will be bound on this
[1:49:49] earth for a thousand years. How many
[1:49:52] believe that's true?
[1:49:54] But but you ain't got to wait till the
[1:49:56] millennium
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; to have victory.
[1:50:01] No,
[1:50:02] you ain't never going to tell me that I
[1:50:05] got to wait till the millennium to have
[1:50:07] dominion over sin, over the devil, and
[1:50:11] over the flesh. Because my Bible says he
[1:50:15] hath made us kings and priests under our
[1:50:19] God.
[1:50:21] You are a spiritual king right now.
[1:50:28] Hallelujah.
[1:50:30] Listen to me church. How many knows
[1:50:32] this? The prophet of God said Satan will
[1:50:34] be bound not by a long chain change of
[1:50:37] circumstances.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; You know what'll bind Satan? You'll have
[1:50:40] nobody
[1:50:42] to work through.
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:45] Satan will be bound in the millennium.
[1:50:47] He said because all his subjects
[1:50:51] are dead. Amen. They're all in the
[1:50:53] grave. There's been no resurrection for
[1:50:54] them. Amen. And there's absolutely
[1:50:56] nobody that Satan can talk through or
[1:51:00] see through or hear through or work
[1:51:03] through.
[1:51:04] [Music]
[1:51:06] Come on, church. Amen. We can't bind
[1:51:08] Satan in America right now. But you can
[1:51:10] bind him in your bedroom.
[1:51:13] [Applause]
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to wait for no millennium
[1:51:18] to find Satan in your life.
[1:51:22] Come on, church. You say, "Brother, how
[1:51:24] to do it?" I tell you, the key has
[1:51:26] already been given by the revelation of
[1:51:28] the word. Amen. Just don't give the
[1:51:31] devil no occasion.
[1:51:34] Just tell the devil tonight, you will
[1:51:35] not use my hands. You will not use my
[1:51:38] eyes. You will not use my ears. You will
[1:51:41] not use my lips.
[1:51:46] I tell you what, I believe we can bind
[1:51:48] Satan in our church. I believe you can
[1:51:50] bind him in your house.
[1:51:54] I believe we ought to have a testimony
[1:51:56] tonight at true word camp that Satan is
[1:51:58] so bound in this camp that he don't even
[1:52:01] know what to do. Amen. Why? Because he
[1:52:04] just can't get nobody.
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:10] Hallelujah. There ain't nobody that's
[1:52:12] going to gossip. There ain't nobody
[1:52:15] that's going to listen.
[1:52:18] Listen to me, young people. The key has
[1:52:20] been given to you. Resist the devil
[1:52:26] and he will flee.
[1:52:33] Hallelujah. Say, "Brother Josh, what are
[1:52:35] you trying to say tonight?" I'm trying
[1:52:36] to say, "Quit laying down.
[1:52:39] [Applause]
[1:52:40] Quit giving in.
[1:52:42] Quit making an excuse.
[1:52:45] Get up.
[1:52:47] Shake yourself. And resist that devil
[1:52:51] tonight.
[1:52:54] Don't forget about the first part of
[1:52:56] that scripture. Submit yourself
[1:52:57] therefore unto God and resist the devil
[1:53:00] and he will flee.
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:06] Paul says it this way. Ephesians 4:27,
[1:53:09] "Neither give place to the devil."
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; You know what that word means in the
[1:53:16] Greek? It means don't give no quarter.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Don't give no license, no opportunity or
[1:53:24] occasion for acting.
[1:53:26] Come on.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; I know some people don't really care for
[1:53:29] this, the Amplified Bible, but it says
[1:53:30] it this way. And do not give the devil
[1:53:33] an opportunity to leave you to lead you
[1:53:36] into sin by holding a grudge or
[1:53:39] nurturing anger or harboring resentment
[1:53:42] or cultivating bitterness.
[1:53:47] I'm giving you the key. Say, "Brother,
[1:53:49] what kind of key you talking about?" I'm
[1:53:51] talking about love. Forgive.
[1:53:54] Repent.
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:57] Say my brother, I fell. Get up.
[1:54:01] But I made a mistake. Make it right.
[1:54:05] Don't lay down.
[1:54:08] Rise up.
[1:54:12] Take the key in your hand tonight.
[1:54:16] Oh, come on, young people. I'm going to
[1:54:18] ask you the question tonight. Has
[1:54:19] anybody got a hand to hold it? The key
[1:54:22] is here. I'm telling you, the key to
[1:54:25] bind Satan is here. You can lead this
[1:54:28] camp with victory.
[1:54:30] The key has been given to you.
[1:54:33] Have you got a hand to hold it?
[1:54:37] Have you got faith to believe it?
[1:54:40] Well, I tell you, if somebody's here
[1:54:41] tonight and you're lacking faith and you
[1:54:43] say, "Brother Josh, I just ain't I just
[1:54:45] can't I'm struggling and I I just ain't
[1:54:47] got enough faith." Well, I got good
[1:54:49] news. My Bible says, "Faith cometh.
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:54:57] Faith cometh.
[1:55:00] Let's just work on that a minute. Faith
[1:55:02] come. You say, "Brother, I I ain't got
[1:55:04] the faith I need." Well, faith cometh.
[1:55:08] Faith is coming to you tonight. Faith
[1:55:11] cometh by the hearing of the word of
[1:55:13] God. Do you realize it? Even right here
[1:55:16] tonight, while the word of God is being
[1:55:18] preached, faith is coming to you.
[1:55:24] And I'll say this, you got more faith
[1:55:27] than you even realize.
[1:55:33] Turn it loose
[1:55:35] and see what'll happen.
[1:55:41] I'm going to close right here. Amen. But
[1:55:43] I say some of you sitting around say,
[1:55:44] "Well, brother, I just ain't got a hand.
[1:55:47] I ain't got a hand to hold it. I just
[1:55:50] ain't got a hand to reach out and grab a
[1:55:51] hold of what you're talking about. I see
[1:55:53] the key is real, but what I'm lacking is
[1:55:55] a hand to hold it. Amen. Well, I got
[1:55:57] some more good news because the prophet
[1:56:00] said, he said that we're living in the
[1:56:02] age now
[1:56:03] that missing limbs will be restored.
[1:56:06] Hallelujah.
[1:56:08] Amen. And he said that if God could
[1:56:10] create a square right there,
[1:56:12] could not he create what is missing on a
[1:56:15] man? Listen, you might have come here.
[1:56:18] Amen. And the devil might have cut your
[1:56:20] hands off. He might have took your faith
[1:56:22] away from you to hold the word of God
[1:56:24] and stand toe to toe with him. But I
[1:56:26] want to tell you, ain't nobody the
[1:56:28] authority of the message of the hour.
[1:56:30] You're living in the right age at the
[1:56:32] right time
[1:56:33] because the God that I serve can create
[1:56:37] a hand
[1:56:39] that will hold the word in the face of
[1:56:42] every devil.
[1:56:46] take the key.
[1:56:48] Reach out and get a chain tonight. And I
[1:56:51] want to encourage every young person in
[1:56:53] this building, lay hold of that old
[1:56:56] devil, that old serpent,
[1:56:59] and bind him in the name of Jesus
[1:57:02] Christ.
[1:57:04] You ain't got to wait to the millennium
[1:57:06] to overcome depression. You ain't got to
[1:57:09] wait till the millennium to overcome
[1:57:11] pornography
[1:57:13] and lust.
[1:57:16] You can do it tonight
[1:57:18] by the power of the word of God. Take it
[1:57:22] in your hand
[1:57:24] and bind the devil and whatsoever you
[1:57:27] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[1:57:31] Hallelujah. Give the Lord some praise
[1:57:34] tonight as the musicians come.
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:43] The key is here.
[1:57:45] [Applause]
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:49] The angel has come. The book is open.
[1:57:54] The mighty angel come to give you the
[1:57:57] revelation.
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:06] Listen friends, there's more sin.
[1:58:08] There's more sin in this age than any
[1:58:10] other age. But God did not leave you
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; fighting with insufficient armor tonight
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; because as a sin increased,
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; brother Brown said the revelation of the
[1:58:26] word,
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; God revealed his word in every age.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; What was it? He was giving you something
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; to overcome with.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, it's just as simple as
[1:58:47] the scripture says. Faith
[1:58:51] is our victory.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:58:58] [Applause]
[1:59:02] [Music]
[1:59:10] Now the Bible plainly tells
[1:59:14] how the Holy Ghost fell.
[1:59:20] Signs and wonders were done by the
[1:59:22] apostles hands.
[1:59:27] Evil spirits were cast down.
[1:59:31] I said evil spirits were cast down.
[1:59:38] They sing
[1:59:42] while surrounded by God's holy
[1:59:45] angel man.
[1:59:49] Now if you think it's all gone
[1:59:53] and the mirales are done,
[1:59:58] I have some good news to bring to you
[2:00:05] in the last days
[2:00:08] of his spo.
[2:00:14] It's
[2:00:38] heat.
[2:00:41] Heat.
[2:00:46] Heat.
[2:00:56] Heat.
[2:01:04] Heat.
[2:01:14] Yeah. Heat.
[2:01:27] Heat.
[2:01:28] Heat.
[2:01:43] Heat.
[2:02:01] Heat.
[2:02:04] Yeah.
[2:02:07] Heat.
[2:02:17] Yeah.
[2:02:21] Heat.
[2:02:31] Heat.
[2:02:46] Heat.
[2:02:54] Oh no.
[2:02:57] Are
[2:03:12] Heat

[2:53:04] hallelujah.
[2:53:06] [Music]
[2:53:07] Hallelujah.
[2:53:10] I so appreciated the way that brother
[2:53:12] Josh
[2:53:13] started off the service this evening.
[2:53:18] It just so expresses the burden behind
[2:53:21] this youth camp.
[2:53:24] [Music]
[2:53:26] that we're not here to get a bunch of
[2:53:28] young people together and feed them
[2:53:31] something watered down,
[2:53:36] some kind of
[2:53:38] some kind of a self-help book or some
[2:53:40] kind of a denominational program or
[2:53:42] something. We're here to give you the
[2:53:44] message. And I'd like you to notice
[2:53:47] tonight what happens
[2:53:49] when you take this message and put it in
[2:53:52] a young man or a young woman's hand.
[2:53:55] It's got power in it to bind. It's got
[2:53:57] power in it to loose. Amen. Preach them
[2:54:01] the message, brothers and sisters. Give
[2:54:03] them the word.
[2:54:05] Amen. Because the faith comes by hearing
[2:54:08] that word.
[2:54:10] Oh, we need it. We need more of it. You
[2:54:13] know, so uh to think of uh how much
[2:54:16] wasted effort goes into youth ministry,
[2:54:18] filling our young people's heads full of
[2:54:21] psychology and theology and philosophy
[2:54:24] and some kind of watering down modern
[2:54:27] something.
[2:54:30] You know, that armor didn't work for
[2:54:31] Saul,
[2:54:34] you know. But Saul just looked down at a
[2:54:36] little David there and he said, "Well,
[2:54:39] well, he thinks he's something, but give
[2:54:40] him what I got. see what he can do with
[2:54:42] it. And you know,
[2:54:44] I uh this is just my personal
[2:54:48] experience. It's not gospel, but
[2:54:49] something I've observed, and maybe you
[2:54:53] would notice this, too. Wherever I've
[2:54:55] ever found a formal,
[2:54:58] starchy, intellectual,
[2:55:01] spiritually dead spirit working in a
[2:55:04] person, a church, a ministry.
[2:55:07] I also find
[2:55:09] in almost every case a disdain for young
[2:55:13] people
[2:55:16] &gt;&gt; cuz it's pride,
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; spiritual pride. Look down and say,
[2:55:20] "Well, when you know what I know and
[2:55:21] when you quote what I can quote and when
[2:55:23] you can teach it the way that I teach
[2:55:25] it, maybe you'll be something,
[2:55:29] you know." But it ain't about what we
[2:55:31] know. Brother Brandham, this was brother
[2:55:33] Brandham's diagnosis of his own of his
[2:55:36] own people. He preached in Tucson. He
[2:55:38] said, you know, he said, I begin to look
[2:55:40] around. I begin to see people cooling
[2:55:41] off.
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; These are message believers now. He
[2:55:44] said, the thing of it is though, it's
[2:55:46] become common to us. It's Amen. We've
[2:55:49] just known it so long, talked about it
[2:55:50] so long,
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; made it into old dead tradition. He
[2:55:54] said, uh, but he said this message
[2:55:56] shouldn't just be the flame of the hour.
[2:55:59] We're not just here to talk about the
[2:56:00] light,
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; he said, but it should be the flame of
[2:56:04] our hearts.
[2:56:06] [Applause]
[2:56:08] And I want to tell you something.
[2:56:12] You can sit in the seat of the scornful
[2:56:14] tonight. You can look down on these
[2:56:17] young believers.
[2:56:19] You can show me. You can show me a young
[2:56:21] man or a young woman that's gets under
[2:56:23] some wildfire.
[2:56:25] But for everyone that you show me
[2:56:26] wildfire, I'm going to find you 50 young
[2:56:29] hearts that are on fire for the message
[2:56:32] of the hour.
[2:56:35] [Music]
[2:56:36] [Applause]
[2:56:38] [Music]
[2:56:40] God's doing something this generation.
[2:56:42] It ain't a bunch of work up.
[2:56:45] It ain't a bunch of emotion. It's the
[2:56:47] flame of the hour. It's an eternal
[2:56:50] flame. Every devil out of hell will
[2:56:52] never snuff it out. But there's more
[2:56:56] behind this word of God than there is
[2:56:58] against it.
[2:57:00] Amen. I thought his brother I got so
[2:57:03] excited. Brother Josh was preaching
[2:57:04] about those chains of circumstance, how
[2:57:07] there's coming a time when that old
[2:57:09] devil that's tormenting these young
[2:57:10] people, he will be powerless. He will
[2:57:13] have no way to affect you cuz he's going
[2:57:16] to be bound by change of circumstance.
[2:57:19] He's going to have nobody to work
[2:57:21] through.
[2:57:24] But on the other side of that, we're
[2:57:27] serving a God that can never be bound by
[2:57:31] chains of circumstance,
[2:57:34] there were some Pharisees came to Jesus
[2:57:36] one time, remember? And they said,
[2:57:37] "Well, you know, you know, uh who, you
[2:57:40] know, don't you know who we are? We're,
[2:57:42] you know, we're we're a teacher so and
[2:57:44] so and we're message theologian so and
[2:57:46] so and we've been in the church 50 years
[2:57:48] and and we're we're really something and
[2:57:50] you know uh we're really something
[2:57:52] better than the next one, better than a
[2:57:53] young person. Jesus said, "You think
[2:57:56] you're somebody cuz of who your daddy
[2:57:57] was and who your grandpa was." He said,
[2:58:00] "But my God is able to take stones and
[2:58:02] make a son of Abraham. I don't care how
[2:58:05] hard you try to bind this message up
[2:58:07] with dead tradition and formal spirits
[2:58:10] and and make it cold and lukewarm and
[2:58:14] powerless. Amen. God's going to have a
[2:58:17] vessel that he can work through.
[2:58:21] And while the people sit around in their
[2:58:23] dead traditions, God's raising up young
[2:58:25] men and young women and setting them a
[2:58:27] light with the flame of the hour.
[2:58:30] Amen. keyh holders,
[2:58:33] you got something in your hand, young
[2:58:35] people. I want you to take hold of it. I
[2:58:37] want you to own this message. I want you
[2:58:39] to take this word and realize it belongs
[2:58:41] to you. It's not just the king's sword.
[2:58:44] It's your sword. I want you to swing it.
[2:58:46] I want you every every denominational
[2:58:48] traditional veil. Amen. All any kind of
[2:58:51] unbelief, anxiety, fear, worry, torment,
[2:58:54] complexness, swing that sword and don't
[2:58:57] you quit.
[2:58:59] If that devil don't move, the prophet
[2:59:00] said, "Whack him again." You got
[2:59:02] something in your hand
[2:59:05] and it can get you in there to where the
[2:59:07] presence of the Lord is. Uh, I'm so
[2:59:09] blessed by the preaching of the word
[2:59:11] tonight. Have you enjoyed? Amen. Have
[2:59:13] you been blessed? I want to thank you
[2:59:15] young people for taking this message
[2:59:16] seriously.
[2:59:19] God's moving on your behalf. Amen. We're
[2:59:22] just thankful for what he's done.
[2:59:24] So appreciate the ministry that has come
[2:59:26] this weekend to support. Brother David
[2:59:28] Siler, would you just come close in
[2:59:30] prayer, brother? We appreciate these
[2:59:32] ministers, pastors taking time out of
[2:59:34] their other responsibilities to come and
[2:59:37] show their support for you. God bless
[2:59:39] you, brother. Let's just bow our hearts.
[2:59:43] Lord, we're so thankful tonight to be
[2:59:45] able to possess the key. Lord, we are so
[2:59:48] grateful that you've called us for this
[2:59:50] day, for this time, for this hour. Lord,
[2:59:53] what a great day to be living in. Lord,
[2:59:55] when every promise is in your word,
[2:59:58] Lord, has been given to a people. And
[3:00:00] Lord, not only is it a people, we
[3:00:02] believe that we are a part of that
[3:00:04] people tonight. We thank you for every
[3:00:06] promise, Lord, for every blessing that
[3:00:08] you poured out, for every deliverance
[3:00:11] that has come tonight. Lord, we believe
[3:00:13] that we've drove the stake in the ground
[3:00:15] tonight. We're claiming what was
[3:00:17] rightfully ours. Lord, we ask that you
[3:00:19] would just bless each one, Lord, as we
[3:00:21] leave this place. Lord, we believe
[3:00:23] there's more in store. Father, the
[3:00:25] prophet said there's untapped resources
[3:00:28] yet. May we go ahead this weekend. May
[3:00:31] we tap into them, I pray. Pour yourself
[3:00:34] out among us, we ask, Lord, in a greater
[3:00:36] measure than you ever have. Make
[3:00:38] yourself known, Lord, in a greater way.
[3:00:40] We'll be so careful to give you the
[3:00:42] praise we thank you for tonight in Jesus
[3:00:45] name. Amen. God bless. You're dismissed.
