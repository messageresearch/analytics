he's not just in this house the building but he's in this house amen we're can't hear that song sung but to think about a prophet who said one time that little girl was down there in the cave and it

amen we want tonight just to buy our hearts before we open the word and let's just in invite him to come I believe he's already here but let's just ask him now in the ministering of his word to just take the preeminence Among Us how many would say Lord you speak through through the minister and here through me amen I believe he's here tonight to do that Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this final service of the Year 2023 Lord father if we would have stood at the end of last year and Lord you would have come down and told us everything that we would go through and every situation every problem every bad day every good day Lord you went through the whole the whole year with us Lord then we would not be walking by faith we'd be walking by side but Lord you didn't do that you just give us your promise that I'm with thee I'll never leave thee I'll never forsake thee and so Lord we know that whatever this year held it would have scared us to death we would have no doubt been fearful and tried to retreat but Lord we stand here at the end of this year knowing that everything we've come through is because of you so Lord our confidence and our Assurance is that much greater tonight as we face this New Year tomorrow that no matter Lord what the next year holds as long long as you're holding our hand oh God lord as you're as long as you're in control of our future then we will not fear and Lord As We Gather here tonight in this watch Night Service father Lord to end out the old year and to bring in the New Year father Lord as we take these next few moments to spend in your word and fellowshipping around the things that you've done Lord and father I pray that you would just come and receive our worship oh God lord you inhabit the Praises of your people and Lord I believe father that you have been well pleased with a worship I believe that you're here tonight bearing record that you're in the Tabernacle so Lord as we look into your word may you continue father Lord to just scatter those Spirits as it were Lord may you continue to increase the light in our life oh God and father I pray AAL blessing upon this assembly upon our brother Wayne upon brother Ry

tonight don't we amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'll invite you to the scripture we'll have have you be turning to the book of Acts the 20th chapter and while you're turning there tonight we do want to take this opportunity just to say we appreciate the invitation to be here and the platform to be able to stand here and preach the message of the hour from and we sure appreciate your pastor brother Wayne appreciate brother Ry appreciate all the ministry here and the stand for this message and the assembly here we just pray the Lord would continue to bless you and to all the vistors here God bless you all good to have everyone here tonight and amen I I don't know a better way to end out the old year and bring in the new year then amen fellowshipping around the word with Believers amen and so we're not going to try not to be before you very long tonight just have a few things here on our heart to share with you and pray it'll be a blessing and a help to you but in the book of Acts the 20th chapter in the 25th verse um actually we'll begin reading at the 24th verse Paul here is is given his Farewell word so to speak and he says here in the 24th verse but none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God and now behold I know that ye all among whom I've have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you somebody say declare declare I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God now watch this change here in verse 28 he says now take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood so I believe that Paul was saying the things that he has declared is now the food to feed the Church of the Living God he says for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock now also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things now here's why they're doing this to draw away disciples after them now therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone day and night with tears and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his is Grace I love this way Paul says it which is able to build you up how many believes that the word of Grace is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified amen we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord here to talk to you and speak to you for just a few moments tonight I want to speak to you on declaring the message with Liberty amen declaring the message with Liberty I've just been recently studying here uh quite a extensive study on the places where brother Brandon will talk about the term Amen in the middle of the road and I I think it's a very powerful thing as Believers I believe it's essential amen for believers to find the balance in all things how many agree amen you got to have the balance in the natural amen as well as in the spiritual I believe that is essential I've often uh thought of how that brother bradam told Brother Perry green he said Perry always keep your balance in the scriptures because that word balance is a very it's a very powerful definition it means a condition in which different elements are equal amen or in the correct proportion stability of one's mind or feelings it means to keep or put something in a steady position so that it does not fall so there amen is a direct connection between balance stability and not falling now you know that Isa said that there would be a highway right and then he said there would be a way and it would be the way of Holiness and then in the Book of Matthew Jesus comes along and he said now there's actually two ways he said there's the Broadway and he said that way leadth unto destruction and many there be that go there in out he said but then there's a narrow way and he said that way is a way to life and he said few there will be that finds it so amen we're seeing here then that there's actually a balance coming to the church amen his brother Brandon would tell us when he come on on the field he said I met two classes of people he said the first class was the fundamental he said they had all the doctrine they knew how to they knew how to write the check but they didn't have no faith he said then was the Pentecostal he said they had all the power and no teaching he said see amen but what I was doing was standing in the middle amen pulling from both sides amen calling to the middle of the road now I kind of think it's something because if you go back and study amen the fundamentals actually had in their mind amen that they were the high class you know they were the ones that had all figured out educated intellectual and then look at the Pentecostals and they was just the people on the other side of the track you know speaking in tongues and shouting and rejoicing and praising God Amen but a Prophet come and he said now this bride she's not going to be high class and he said she's not going to be low class he said but I'm going to bring her to the middle of the road and she's going to be middle class Amen in other words she's going to live in a balance where she will not be up one day amen and down the next but listen she will come to a place amen of stability to where nothing will be able to move her amen from the things that I have revealed to her and I'll say it like this I do not believe that the message of the hour amen needs to be balanced amen I believe that it is already balanced amen amen I believe that when the prophet said I'm always in the middle of the road amen he said the angel of the Lord is in the middle of the road he said the pillar of fire is in the middle of the road he said he said the true message lays in the middle of the road so sometimes amen people get to wondering how are we going to fix this how are we going to balance it amen you're not going to do it in your own understanding amen but if you'll begin to declare the message amen the message is already balanced and the message amen will bring a thing to the stability now Amen brother says it very beautifully he said when you're born again he said you are positionally placed in the middle of the road amen when you were born again you were not born in one ditch amen or the other you were born again positionally placed in the middle of the road he said some people when they get born again they get set right in the middle of the road and their eyes are on Christ and finally they get over here so much knowledge and wisdom oh they know it all but you don't know nothing and if you don't do that then you run off on this side with a bunch of wildfire and fanaticism amen but right in the middle of the road amen there's a true sound unadulterated gospel and power of God that's right amen right down through there taking the Kings and the monarchs where any anybody can stand in search amen and they can see that it's the power amen of almighty God it's not a fanaticism and it's not a formality amen it's the power of God Amen I want to declare unto you tonight amen that the atmosphere that's in this building tonight amen it's not a fanaticism amen and neither is it a formality amen but it's the power of the almighty God it is the promise of the father that he said he would endure you amen with power from on high brother B said friends I've always tried to keep a balance of the road he said you get way off on formalism Amen just just formal ritualistic as they can be and people grab for that but then if you don't watch you'll get so pum over on the other side and be just as fanatic as you can be amen but there's a middle of the road where the true sound s gospel is preached amen and God moves in there amen amen God don't move in the formal ditch amen and God don't move in the fanatical ditch amen but God moves in the middle of the road amen and vindicates the move to be the truth amen I want to say this man does not have to vindicate this message amen God has already amen Vindicated this message as the balance Amen to the church in the age we're living brother said the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving amen and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience Amen to the spirit amen just to move as the spirit moves amen not till or not after amen but just as the spirit moves now amen I was listening to a tape the other day and I love how the prophet says things he said now don't forget this coming New Year's night he said oh I remember the first watch party that I've ever had here in this Tabernacle he said I don't guess there's anyone here remembers it amen but that was one night amen that the Lord took plenty of starch out of your pasture amen that was one night amen that the Lord took plenty of starch out of your pastor amen so we're looking forward for a great time being Brothers telling the church the first watch night party we ever had in this church amen the Holy Ghost took all the starch amen out of me and I wondered why amen he would use that word starch amen because the word starch means stiffness amen and when something gets stiff amen then it's no longer flexible it's no longer pliable amen but when it loses the start amen and the spirit of God begins to move then you're as flexible as the new growth in the trees you're as you're as liberated as the as the sons of God Amen because it's not a man moving you it's the spirit moving you amen I know sometimes people wonder amen as Christians they Wonder Lord what do I need to really be amen what God has called me to be do I need an education or do I need to get all these things memorized what do I need to be but can I tell you what I believe from the message amen that every single one of you all need Amen to be what God called you to be I believe it's found in 2 Corinthians 3 where Paul said now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is amen there is Liberty amen that's the only thing we need is Liberty that word Liberty has a very powerful definition it means to do or to Omit things amen that have no relationship to Salvation amen Liberty is a license it's the Liberty to do as one pleases amen true Liberty amen is living as we ought to amen and not as we please amen now can I say it like this I thank God for sending the message of the hour because I believe that the message of the hour amen has omitted everything that has nothing to do with true salvation amen or relationship to Jesus Christ amen in other words I'll say it like this amen the message of the hour has omitted all the nonsense amen it's omitted all the Baptist ideas and Pentecostal tradition Amen in Catholic carryover the message of the hour has omitted all that and has brought a liberty into the church amen to cause the bride Amen to be exactly what she is brother B said not for one moment do I bring a message Amen to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship I have never done that and I will not do that now I have no interest in those things amen but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied and that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men where in men become New Creations in Christ they are filled with his spirit and they live according to his word amen the purpose of the message was that God would fill you with the Holy Ghost but he would not just give you the baptism but he would bring you to the full restoration of the word and you would live according to the word now I believe that if we're going to have Liberty amen we have got to identify amen the source of Liberty amen I believe that our Liberty does not come from a man I don't believe our Liberty comes from a church or or a bishop or a denomination amen but I believe our Liberty comes from the message of the hour I believe that the message of the hour is amen our license amen I believe it's our license to pray I believe it's our license to cast out Devils I believe it's our license to speak in t Tong I believe it's our license to shout I believe it's our license to have prayer lines I believe it's our license to have altar calls I believe it's our license to have to have anything that go the spirit of God Amen wants in the church the message has given us a right to have it amen now in 1 John 1:1 I love what the Bible says it says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life amen for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now verse three John says that which we have seen and heard amen declare we unto you that you may also have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ amen now John uses three very powerful words there he uses the word seen which that word seen means to see with the mou mind to see with the eyes amen this word gives prominence to the Discerning mind amen and then John uses the word heard and that word heard means not to be deaf it means to perceive amen by the ear what is announced in one's presence amen it means to learn or to give ear to a teaching or a teacher but then he comes down and uses a very powerful word he says declare amen I love this word decare because it means to Proclaim and to make known openly amen John is saying in this the things we write unto you that your joy may be full he said this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all amen I love that that word message means announcement that word message means promise so we can very well say Amen that the message is the announcement amen the message is the promise the message is the blessing amen that in God there is no Darkness in him is only light amen I love what brother says and he that is in you he said father we would ask tonight for Mercy amen for Liberty of the spirit that we might be able to bring to the people amen the gospel truth and the what we believe to be the message of the hour for your church now I'll say it like this I believe amen that we have seen the message how many can testify we have seen the message I believe we can say we have heard the message amen but I want to say we've seen it and we've heard it amen but if there's ever been a time Brother David Amen to declare it amen now is the time to declare amen the things that we have seen and the things that we've heard Isaiah said in Isaiah 48:6 he said thou has heard and see all this and will not you declare it I have showed thee new things from this time amen even hidden things and thou didst not know them in Deuteronomy 29:29 he said the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are are revealed amen belong unto us and to our children forever amen that we may do all the words of this law amen so God here is saying in this message that he's sending to the church it's going to be more than just a it's going to be more than just scriptures it's going to be more than just quotes amen but what God is sending to the church amen is the hidden things becoming the revealed things that way you would actually become a partaker of those things that's being revealed amen I it because the prophet says in two very powerful quotes you know him by heart he said my Ministry is different right from a pastor or a teacher I'm not and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean to but this is my Ministry see is to declare him that he's here amen the prophet's Ministry was to declare him that he's here in anointed ones at the end time he said notice amen the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his his message he's going to declare he's here but then he's going to begin to declare his message amen see the first pull was healing and the second pull was prophesied amen but the third pull was the opening of the word amen the Mysteries revealed and there's no more higher order to open or reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember that the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word can I ask you all something amen why would God send a prophet to take the hidden things and to reveal them to the church and then say you cannot have them why would God send a prophet Amen to reveal the Thunders and reveal the seals and reveal the trumpets and reveal every symbol as he was anointed to do from The Book of Revelation and then turn and Shake but you all can't have it amen I don't believe that that's my God I believe if my God revealed it he did it for a purpose and that purpose was so somebody amen could declare the revelation of the word of God in the age they're living in listen the Baptists are declaring Noah the methodists are declaring Moses amen there's all kinds of Bible characters being declared but now's bride time amen for somebody to rise up under the liberty of the Holy Ghost and declare that God is God and His word is true and his power is real and his anointing is real and Liberty is here and deliverance is here come on I say what tonight ought to be it ought to be a night amen that Devils die I think tonight ought to be a night amen that Spirits die I think tonight ought to be a night that you say the things I've carried through 23 I refuse I refuse I refuse to carry him into 24 those things are going to die tonight because the message of the hour has given me a license to Kill them things and let God arise and his enemies be scattered and Liberty come in the church amen God has a provided way for everything right amen and God's provided way to declare his word was by prophets he said notice he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way see he chose the way his word came and that was by prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being a part of God's word declaring the revelation of his word to that age and that time I love what the prophet says here he says a Moder day Prophet is a preacher so a real true Prophet only points back to the word of the Lord amen the promise of the Lord he said not the Declaration the church has made but a declaration God has made amen see back to the word of the Lord so brother Brandon was not declaring what the church thought he was not declaring what the pope thought he was declaring what God had thought about you from before the foundation of the world now watch a Vindicated Prophet I'm going somewhere which is God's chosen way to declare his word in 1951 he said now I stand Here declaring the creator of heavens and earth is Jehovah God I claim to be a representative of his in these last days to bring Faith to his church and looking under Jesus he said in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here under under my control Amen to declare the word of God I take every spirit in here under my control to declare the word of God you say preacher why would you take such time Amen to say about declaring because church we have a responsibility amen we have a responsibility God didn't send us this message Amen to argue and debate and fuss and argue and pull apart and hack this out and put this in amen God sent us this message amen that it might help our young people people it might help our families it might help our churches and listen it's never going to help unless it's declared he say well brother Ander I'm not a preacher amen but are you a believer of it amen have you got the Holy Ghost has God saved your soul has God filled you with the Holy Ghost then you got a right you got a right to declare amen the message of the hour as the inside of this generation brother said everything is a responsibility he said and so it is easy when the responsibility faces us that we try to Sherk back from it amen and find out amen that all things are responsibility he said sometimes ministers many times they Will Sher a responsibility amen for standing for the true word of God when they're confronted with it they'll Sher that responsibility but when the truth of the word of God is brought face to face with we human beings we are prone to Sherk back until the last resource another place you said before the church can ever be taken to Glory it has has to go through this world of criticism amen it has to go through this world of criticism now we can all agree we we don't like criticism amen but can I tell you like the prophet said he said I don't like tubless tires but they're here to stay he said I don't like half-dressed women but they're here to stay and brother said like this he said we got to go through the criticism before we hang in the Hall of Fame amen and sometimes we try to pull back amen because we're afraid of some criticism what can I tell you if if you're waiting on there to be no critics if you're waiting on there to be no criticism before you do anything for God you're going to sit there and miss the greatest opportunity that has ever been given to do something listen there always will be critics but I'll tell you what the critics are going to do they're going to criticize I tell you what the scoffers are going to do they're going to scoff I'll tell you what the unbelievers are going to do they're going to unbelief I'll tell you what the make Believers are going to do they're going to make believe but I'll tell you what the Believers are going to do do they're going to believe I tell you what the worshippers are going to do they're going to worship I tell you what the praisers are going to do they're going to praise I tell you what the singers are going to do they're going to sing I tell you what the preachers are going to do they're going to preach I tell you what the shouters are going to do they're going to shout amen because they have been put on the earth to declare the revelation of the word for the age they're living in we have a responsibility to declare Paul says I have not shunned to declare unto you amen all the counsel of God I haven't lost my thought amen God was speaking through Paul and he was revealing some things and he said now Paul when you begin to declare it don't you just declare what you want to don't you just declare what will keep you out of criticism don't you just declare what everybody wants to hear but when you begin to declare the things I reveal you declare all the counsel of God you know what the counsel of God is the Bible says the counsel of God is the purpose of God so Paul was saying I have not shunned to declare the purpose of God Amen that word shunn means to draw back it means to let down it means to withdraw it is of a timid person to withdraw oneself it means to to cover of those who from timoy they hesitate to avow what they believe it means to be unwilling to utter from fear to shrink from declaring to conceal or to dissemble amen I want to say this there is nothing that can defeat the purpose of God there is nothing that can defeat the purpose of God in your life there is nothing can defeat the purpose of God in this church the prophet said woe unto me if I don't declare this counsel of God the people of his healing power and he is here amen Christ the son of God is here to heal the sick and the needy friends I believe he's here tonight I believe he's here to heal I believe he's here to save I believe he's here to deliver I believe he's here to answer questions I believe he's here to give a refilling of the Holy Ghost I believe he's here in the power of his resurrection to do exactly what his word said he would do now when the word Prophet comes on the scene and he begins to declare things about God he's going to declare God's attitude towards you brother said it very beautifully he said I told them that you love them and you got the same respect for them that you did for that woman that night many years ago what he's speaking of Amen is the worst sinner in the city he's speaking of a man who held a party and invited Jesus and when he got there amen he wouldn't entertain him but there was a woman there that was willing to be criticized there was a woman there that was willing to be made fun of brother Carrie there was a woman there that was willing to be kicked aside but she knew who he was and she was not ashamed by her actions to declare that this is the Messiah that this is the god that can save me from my sin he can forgive me of my iniquity oh church tonight I pray there's never one service that that God walks in the building and he's sitting in the corner with dirty feet I pray somebody would get up and they would go over and find him and by their actions they would declare he is the Messiah he is the savior he is the Healer he is is the restorer he is the anointed one he is the mighty conqueror he is the Messiah he is my god brother B said he cannot be a Healer once and not a Healer again he cannot be a god of Miracles one day and not a god of Miracles the next day he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still God and if you'll take the right mental attitude towards any promise when you read it in the Bible it's the truth no matter how many tries to put it in another age it's in the past or it's an age in the future he never did declare amen that he was the I was or he's the I I will be he always declared himself as the I am as the I am see then I love how that when Paul amen I pray this is okay when Paul writes to Timothy he says three very powerful and and and straight words to Timothy he says preach the word am me can we say that together preach the word he said preach the word you be instant in season out of season you reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine now that word preach means to Proclaim after the manner of a Herald it is always with the suggestion of formality gravity and Authority which must be listened to and obeyed Amen to preach means to publish it means to Proclaim openly amen something which has been done Amen brother said we ministers we have orders from you Lord and that is preach the word amen that's why we call us Full Gospel preachers is we preach the whole word the whole counsel of God listen I say thank God that there's a Ministry in the last days that's got the courage and the guts Amen to take the gloves off and not declare the part of the message they like or the part of the message they think is important but they will declare 47 to 65 they will declare Holiness they will declare Revelation they will declare correction will declare encouragement come on Church y'all know I'm telling the truth we're living in a day and time hey when we're men don't want to preach the message they just want to get up and tell a story oh God or just or just water it down amen but I'm going to say something you'll never help the church as long as you're playing with this message as long as you're adding to and taken away and hacking here and hacking there and well brother brandham didn't mean this and brother Bram didn't mean that and now I'm going to tell you oh god well I might as well preach I'm here I'm going to tell you what we need in the church and what we don't need in the church amen and God oh God help me he and guys literally get up and they devalue the message to promote the message you know what I say I say if you ain't going to say what a prophet said sit down and let somebody up that will if you ain't going to preach this message in the power and the authority and the gravity and the anointing that it was delivered to sit down and let somebody that will because we got people that need help we got people that need change we got people that need Deliverance amen and playing with this message ain't going to do it come on I believe I believe we ought to lose all of our sham inness of this message I know that Devil's running around well we don't need the pictures and we don't need this amen well we might as well preach amen because how long's it going to be before they take the pictures out they take the books out for long it's going to take everything out amen but there's some bethleem dwellers I said there's some Bethlehem dwellers that believe this message and they believe it's more than just a Kian they believe it's more than just an idea they believe it's the way they believe it's the truth they believe it's the life they believe it's the only way in a Rapture and they're willing to fight for this message come on they're willing to fight for this message because they know without this message there's no way into Rapture but if this message is the truth and you believe it is then we got to write tonight Amen to declare what God has done in our generation and not be embarrassed about it amen I'll say this our preach of the message amen and believe in the message it must be free from Prejudice our preaching of the message and our believing of the message it must be free from Prejudice you say what is Prejudice it means an adverse opinion or leaning formed without without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge an instance of such judgment or opinion it is an irrational attitude of hostility that is directed against an individual a group a race or their supposed characteristics Amen in other words they get up and they say things they have no knowledge of what they're talking about so they get up and say well all you people out there just bubble dancing and shouting around on the meeting and and have no knowledge Brother Ray have no knowledge what they're talking about they have no knowledge that some of them people that are shouting was just a few days ago ready to give up they have no they have no knowledge that them families around the altar that are Weeping and crying amen had just a few years ago was ready to walk away amen but God who is rich in mercy God who is rich in Mercy spared their families spared their lives spared their babies I'm going to go ahead and say it you can take everything away from me but you will never take away my praise you will never take away my worship you will never take away my Liberty you will never take away my joy you know why because you didn't give it to me and you can't take it you didn't save me so you can't unsave me you didn't heal me so you can't un heal me you didn't redeem me so you can't unredeem me I don't belong to a church I don't belong to a man I belong to the message of the hour the message is my license and I'll just go ahead and say it I ain't going to get no ditch either now I might as well preach I'm this close to it amen we got a lot of guys holler in midle of the road and they need a Ballance to midle the road and ain't taking five minutes to read what the prophet of God said the middle of the road was they're trying to make the midd of the road some ice box where you just come and sit down and learn a few clothes and get a little bit of head knowledge and you're real balanced amen hell glory to God Amen I'll tell you what Amen in the ditch of formality there's no Liberty if you get in a formal ditch there's no Liberty you want me prove it to you get in a formal ditch and try to have a prayer line get in a formal ditch and try to pray your way through a situation get in a formal ditch and let the anointing come to the building amen and you're so bound up you don't know what to do you know why you're in a ditch well get over in the fanatical ditch and try to take a solid service and teach some lead you the message and teach the way a prophet taught it amen you're so bound up you can't teach you can't preach you can't operate amen but if you ever get out of the ditch and get over in the middle of the road I'll tell you where I'm at I'm in the middle of the road and in the middle of the road we got Liberty to preach we got Liberty to teach we got Liberty to sing We got Liberty to pray we got Liberty to shout we got Liberty to cry we got Liberty to dance we got Liberty to Rejoice because we are are a liberated people by the message of the hour well I might as well say it you ain't or no other person going to put us in a ditch we are too free for a ditch we are too free for formality we are too free for fanaticism we believe the message now you said well that's Prejudice is it amen is that really Prejudice brother B said they accused Jesus of prejudice he said you know what they did they he said he's just Prejudice they said why is he Prejudice he said because he come among them and he wouldn't join up with their group see that's why the devil don't like us is we're not a part of a group we're not a part of a click we're not come on Church we're not a part of some boys club this ain't a society this ain't a Who's Who and who's not this is the Bride of Jesus Christ and everybody's got a place everybody's got a position everybody can have Liberty it don't matter what family you come out of it don't matter what church you come out of it don't matter what your name is what your background is in the spirit of the Lord is amen there is Liberty amen I've heard people can I preach brother Wayne I've heard people say well amen people go to that church because they do things the way they like to do they go to that church because they act the way they like to act have you ever thought that people go to a church because where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty ever thought amen that people's tired of religion amen they're tired of tradition they're tired of formality they're tired of man's ideas they're tired of opinions they're ready to get somewhere where they can have some Elbow Room they're ready to get somewhere where the Holy Ghost can break out and if they feel like weeping they can weep if they feel like running they can run come on CH where the spirit of the Lord is come on where the spirit of the the Lord is not where the spirit of the Lord was or where the spirit of the Lord will be where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty well I believe that Liberty is here tonight because the spirit of the Lord is here oh glory to God Amen I believe it I believe that when that Revelation broke amen a prophet begin to see that there is a truth in the in the fundamentals there's a truth in the Pentecostals I believe when he begin to see that Revelation and he began to declare that Revelation he could not hold back you say he cannot hold back no because Amos 3 says that the line has roared and who can but prophesy amen listen just as Jesus could not hold back on the Revelation amen the Bride of Jesus Christ his disciples cannot hold back neither amen I love this in Matthew 13:11 Jesus said it is given unto you to know the Mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given said I've come here for the purpose of teaching amen the last vows and the last seven trumpets and the last seven thunders of the Book of Revelation amen tying them together in this hour that we're now living to follow the opening of The Seven Seals the seven Church ages but in this now I took this opportunity to express to the people my belief and faith in God and bringing you to the hour that we're living in and by this it's not appointed to any certain person any Creed or whatever it might be it's just as I see God's word see because Jesus said he could not hold nothing back from his disciples you are the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Jesus now can I say this to you Jesus did not give his disciples amen private interpretation the Bible says amen knowing this verse that no prophecy of this scripture is of any private interpret ation can I show you what this word prophecy means it is a discourse amen that is emanating from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God Amen so prophecy amen is coming from the Divine mind declaring the purpose of God brother said watch amen see when that Spirit begins to move now watch here this word interpretation very beautiful word you all know brother preaches God interprets his own word right he says how does God interpret his word by bringing his word to pass can I tell you what the word interpretation means in the in the Greek it means a loosening or un loosen so when something is interpreted it has the power to loosen it has the power to unloose it has the power to rebuke the restraints it has the power to give Liberty now watch this because private interpretation you know where it comes from it comes from Eve's interpreter which was The Serpent and you know what private interpretation does it binds the church it binds the praise it binds the response it binds the amen it binds the faith it binds the young people I tell you what it is it's a spirit of private interpretation y'all get mad at me if you want you but I'm going to say it it come from the pits of hell and it does not belong in a message Church it come from the pits of hell and it does not belong in a message Church there is no room in a message church for private interpretation but there is room for true interpretation because true interpretation it comes from the spirit of Truth and when it comes in the church it loosens the church now you all know that Mark 16 amen says these words it says they shall go in my name and they shall cast out Devils I'm turning the corner now they'll go out in my name and my name they shall cast out Devils brother said they cast out the devil is the preaching of the Gospel yeah the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil oh God that's why the devil fights the preaching don't get mad at me amen but you go to church go to church on your midweek service and come in and sit down and let them start singing amen you don't fight to stay awake during the singing you don't fight to stay awake during the singing amen but when the word goes to being preached am come on church when the singing's going on you don't sit there and say well I wonder what I didn't do at work and I got to do this tomorrow when I go back no but when the word Goes Forth the devil tries to get your mind on every kind of every kind of track he can get it on you know why because he knows that if fat word connects with fat seed in your soul he's lost his hold over your life because the preaching of the word is the casting out of the devil come on brother B said Music cast out evil spirits so that music is pushing against those evil spirits but when the preacher begins to preach and he begins to lay that word out out there that's not the time Amen to change your filter and try to filter it through this private interpretation filter it through that private interpretation that's the time to say Lord I'm sick and tired of living bound I'm tired of living under what man thinks and man says and man told I'm ready to come back to the landmark to the homeland of the church the message of the hour so when you begin to preach the word you know what happens the devil's cast out so you can believe the word amen you know what preaching is it's spiritual warfare preaching is spiritual warfare but can I say this thank God for some preachers that get in spiritual warfare but they don't quit brother Ray's been in it for many years and he hasn't quit he hasn't laid his sword down are you hearing me church because they believe there's a Cause worth fighting for they'll fight through tightness they'll fight through unbelief they'll preach through well I'm old preacher I'm old bust they'll fight through every devil trying to pray him and choke on their words but they'll stand there and they'll lay that word out they'll preach that word because they know that if that word connects with your soul it'll change your life forever I get a witness here tonight that can say thank God Amen that somebody preached the word thank God that somebody declared the message thank God that somebody stood there and said there's not a devil big enough there's not a spirit strong enough to stop God from delivering me in my situation Hallelujah you say brother anderw is it easy it's not easy but we don't quit I said we don't quit how many preachers have I gotten the building tonight amen preachers we don't quit I said we don't quit I said we don't quit well brother Andrew it's getting tight we don't quit what brother so and so's looking at me we don't quit what brother the devil's trying to pressure me we don't quit you know why we don't quit because we are accompanied by an innumerable amount of angels hallelujah amen brother B said Angels appear in the end time he said all the prophets and sign po points poster in this day that angels will appear prophets will arise and if God did that for those little Junctions back there then what will he do now when all hell is turned loose I know why it's hard to preach I know why it's hard to worship I know why it's hard sometimes to come to church I know I'm preaching to you now because all hell has been turned loose against you brother said the lid of hell is come off and demon powers are flowing to the people but can I read the rest of it if all hell is turned loose he said then all heaven will turn loose if all hell turn loose then all of heaven will turn loose I say open up the windows of Heaven tonight I say open up the windows of Heaven tonight and fill this place with Angelic beings fill this place with ministering spirits that are sent forth to minister those who are The Heirs of Salvation if all hell is turned loose all heaven will turn loose angels will appear signs and wonders on the earth amen listen the counterfeits are rising the counterfeits are rising but God is proving which is right and wrong oh I love that the counterfeits are rising but God is proven which is right and which is wrong you the counterfeits arising look in your Bible sometime in 2 Timothy 3:8 and see if it don't say this as Janice and jambers whed Moses can I preach to you now so do these also resist the truth they are men of corrupt minds they are reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their Folly shall be made manifest unto all men as theirs also was brother pi this up and spoken word of the Original Seed he says and the Bible said as they withstood Moses in the last days they would reappear brother Dallas those Spirits again the same Janice and jambers devilish spirits that with stood Moses back there were promised to reappear in the last days brother B said what I love this brother Nathan just before the liberation of the people testing one two testing it's still working just before the liberation of the people just before the liberation of the people the spirit of Janice and jambers would reappear Hallelujah he says The Liberation time is here well if Janice and jambers is here amen then that must mean Liberty's here if the counterfeits are here that must mean the real is here if the devil is here that must mean God is here if hell is here that must mean Heaven is here this is not the time to back up this is not the time to lay down it's your hour of Liberty The Liberation time is [Applause] here now you say brother Andrew you're a preacher them men of God are preachers they get up there and they preach and that's they don't quit because they got help preaching well amen don't speak too soon brother BR so they not all ministering Spirits sent forth the minister of the Airs of Salvation brother I'm just a I'm just a church member I'm just coming here and sitting on the pews and trying to believe and Brother David just trying to get through and just trying to overcome listen don't you let the devil sell you that [Applause] lie it's not just angels in the pull Pit Brother B said May the May every seat become Anointed with the Holy Spirit May the angels of God just appear as it was over the audience day after day night after night until there will not be a sick or feeble one in our midst he said now if I fail Lord I don't mean to he said but help me to explain Thy Word in such a way that the people would believe on thy beloved Son and be healed and be saved can I say this to you the same Angels that's helping the preacher preach the word is the same Angels that's helping you believe the word brother B said may your angels of God just take their positions and places positionally Out Among the People speaking to their Hearts getting him to believe and take away all unbelief I love this one he said may the great Powers may the great angels that rol away the stone on Easter morning may they stand present today to roll away every stone of Doubt every fear every Discord taken away amen from the hearts of the people come on y'all know what I'm talking about when they took the stone away over Jesus tomb you know what that meant it was time for Resurrection when they took the stone away from Lazarus grave Brother Ray at meant it was time for resurrection and here's a oh God here's a prophet of the Resurrection sign and he's standing in the pull pit and brother brother Jeremy is saying these words may the same angel of God that was there on Easter morning may he come in this building tonight and may He roll away the stone of fear the stone of unbelief the stone of Discord off of the heart of every believer that they can see that Jesus Christ lives and Reigns and his power I'm just going to preach on this one stone for a little bit before I close if that's okay it's called the stone of fear it's called the stone of fear you know what Paul said he said I have not shined to declare unto you all the counsel of God that word shined means to be unwilling to utter from Fear right to shine something means you're unwilling to utter the truth because of fear brother B said this one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear everybody is scared to death everything is what's going to happen who what another place he said the greatest thing I find against the church tonight is fear everybody is scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man is born again he should be happy come on I'm not backing up I'm not afraid of that spirit of fear if a man is born again he should be happy he should be carefree just like the fellow singing up here and the testifying back there just free there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future and there's nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Oh Glory to God we ought to be happy and we ought to be carefree I said we ought to be happy and we ought to be carefree we ought to be happy and we ought to be carefree you say well brother Andrew I'm not happy and I'm not care free well declare war on everything that's causing you not to be happy and not to be carefree God did not save you to bind you God did not bring you into this message to put you on a Pew and put Shackles on your hands and Shackles on your feet and Shackles on your faith and Shackles on your family and Shackles on the anointing I think if anybody ought to be free it ought to be the Bride of Jesus Christ I think it's time to be happy come I think it's time to be carefree I know what I'm talking about right now amen Carefree is when you didn't care testing one two it's still working Carefree is when you didn't care you remember when you used to when you first got saved and you didn't care to raise your hands you didn't care to say Amen you didn't care to worship you didn't care to praise you didn't care to holler you didn't you didn't care about anything you were just Carefree you were just so happy to be in the house of God God one more time but then something happened and something happened and this happened and before long care begin to pile up on care y'all some of y'all here have been to New Zealand several years ago I think it was I can't if it's our first trip brother Isaac or the second trip but I was in New Zealand and I was with some brothers and we were walking down the street and brother Wayne there was a there was a couple people walking down through there just just just citizens and brother Ray they're walking through there and it would be it would not even be appropriate for me to describe in a church what them people look like it was unbelievable what they were wearing and the way they was acting and I looked at the brothers with me and I said is this normal I mean I know I'm from America but is this normal I mean look at this and one brother looked at me he said oh brother Andrew he said yeah he said that's normal he said but we call them that don't care no more and I said the what he said oh we call them that don't care no more he said they've gone so far that they don't care what Society thinks about them they don't care what their family thinks about them they don't care what anybody thinks about them they just don't care no more I said you mean they don't care what somebody thinks about them when they come out of the house looking like that he said no brother they were there that don't care no more I said so you mean to tell me that they've come to a place in their life that they've crossed a line between caring and not caring he said brother that's the best way I know how to say it I thought oh God if that's in the natural if the devil from Hell if all hell can be turned loose and demon powers come streaming up on the people change the way they look change the way they marry change the way they dress change the way they talk change the way they conduct themselves and brother Ray they cross a line that they don't care no more then what about the Bride of Jesus Christ I said what about the Bride of Jesus Christ if hell I said if hell can influence them not to care no more and what about the Bride of Jesus Christ when the seventh seal come open it brought Christ back to Earth again and there's a bride on the earth tonight she don't care no more she don't care what you think about her she don't care what you think about her praise she don't care what you think about her worship because she has been liberated she's free I said she's free I said she's free I think it's time to get free again don't you walk in 2024 bound you can walk in there free brother andw you lost your mind Noah hat and I'm free now don't care no more I don't care no more on I don't care what they say I don't care what they think I am who I am by the grace of God I might as well go ahead and say it I am a Son of God that's been saved that's been redeemed that's been filled with the Holy Ghost I'm following the message of the hour the pillar of fire is my headship heaven is my home the Rapture is my goal the devil is my enemy and there's nothing you can say there's nothing you can do to put this bride back under bondage again to fear we don't care no more well we don't care no more but I might as well preach I'm here we don't care no more we have heard from our theophany we have heard from that other dimension we have heard from that other side and there's something in us that believes more over there than we believe here we believe it's more real over there than it is here brother Chuck we believe that Dimension is more real than this Dimension sister Debbie we believe that Dimension is more closer than this Dimension listen friends we don't care no more we don't care what they think about our preaching we don't care what they think about our Doctrine we believe the message and we're not ashamed we're not ashamed to declare it now I want say this to you said Oh my he said see fear not Jesus said over and over fear not now it rebukes the spirit of fear by the word and says you've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but youve received the spirit of adoption brother BR said then he died and sent back the Holy Spirit and said the church take this and fight with it and follow me are you ready for this the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Ghost that Christ died at Calvary to free his church from superstitions and fear and doubt and trembling praise God can I say this fear is real but it's defeated fear is real but it's defeated fear is a spirit it's real but it's defeated I'm declaring what I seen and what I heard fear is real fear is a spirit but it's defeated y'all know what fear is fear is an Intimidator and a manipulator in other words what fear does is fear comes in and begins to intimidate you which then when it backs you down and gets intimidated then it begins to manipulate you if it comes in and scares you and intimidates you and get you to be unwilling to utter from Fear right what you should be declaring and so you start backing up and drawing back and it gets you intimidated and then it begins to manipulate you can I prove it to you amen look at Co yeah don't get mad at me I believe Co was real but I believe the spirit of fear was more real than the germ was I believe the fear that followed Co was more real than the actual germ y'all know what I'm talking about because we was all living Our Lives we was doing our daily activities living our lives and then all of a sudden somewhere we heard a report that there's a virus broke out in a foreign country and it's possibly coming to America and oh my we weren't afraid of it you know it's just another scare and then it actually showed up and it actually showed up and it be to intimidate people and they begin to change change oh come on now they begin to change now now I'm I'm I'm I'm preaching here with some Grace cuz we had to amen but y'all know I'm telling the truth we never went to Walmart with three masks on our face we never put JX and all of our cars well maybe me and David Tyler we never are you hearing me we never done these things are you hearing me but it begin to intimidate and then it begin to manipulate and then then it begin to change the way we done things because it was a spirit of fear now I might as well just goad and say it since I'm this close to it it manipulated our way of life it kept us away from church it put us six feet apart it put us in in Corry in quarantine it did all kinds of things it was a it was a manipulator and an Intimidator but I want to close the on this right here just as much as I believe there's a natural fear in the last days I believe there's a spiritual fear that's broke out around the church Living God and it's a fear of brother Andrew we better be careful we're going to get out of balance we better be careful we're going to get out of the middle of the road we better be careful because so and so taught this about the seventh seal so don't nobody teach nothing about the seventh seal and brother so and so taught this about his presence so don't nobody teach this about is PR but I'm feeling good now and so and so talk this about the godhead so don't nobody touch the godhead and before long that Spirit has intimidated and it's manipulated and it's changed our way of preaching it's changed our way of teaching it's a spirit of fear from the pits of Hell well I might as well go ahead and bump the other devil well brother be careful cuz if the Holy Ghost gets to move and and somebody gets to shout oh they may get out of line they may get out out of order that's a spirit of fear that's trying to change the way we have church I said that's a spirit of fear it's trying to change the way we worship trying to change the way we praise and so people get bound up in their Spirit Well I'm afraid if I raise my hands they may think I'm this or if I say Amen they may think I'm this or if I go to the altar they may think this but can I say this tonight fear is defeated we will not live in fear we will not let natural fear spiritual fear Church fear we'll not let fear intimidate and manipulate Our Lives that's right what are you saying belander I'm saying fears of the devil yeah now you want me prove it to you brother B said everything Jesus would say is fear not God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe now I know what fear does Fear will start manipulating to will start man ulating you in such a way it'll change the way we preach the message so if we reading a certain quote I hope this okay if we're reading a certain quote then we must be this way and if we're reading this quote we must be that way and if we say this we must be this and if we sing this we must be this Brother Ray and if we if we do this we must be this amen can I just tell you what we are we're

Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about it's a spirit of fear and if it got its way it control our young girls and churches and our young boys but it's defeated this message is not fear that's right it's liberty can I say it like this Brother Ray the devil done what he wanted to do Jesus left his disciples they got on the ship to go across the sea and when they went across the sea a storm Rose brother said the wind become contrary now I'm not making something out of this but I just think it's amazing brother said the wind become contrary in Ephesians 4 he said they're cre about with every wind of Doctrine and they're sailing across the sea and all of a sudden the storm is is brewing the wind is blowing the rain is falling the wind everything is contrary and then all of a sudden brother Nathan they look up and come walking on the water and they say it's a spirit yeah the spirit of fear was in the boat and got them so afraid they're going to the bottom brother Carrie they're on their way down they need help and the only thing that could help him is now walking on the water and they're looking at it and they're scared to death of it they're looking at their only help and they're saying it's a spirit they're afraid amen but can I say this then Jesus spoke then Jesus spoke and you know what he said he said be of good cheer it is I Be not [Applause] Afraid brother Wayne the way he rebuked the fear was he declared he here the way he rebuked the fear was he said my Ministry is different from the pastor it's different from the Evangelist my Ministry is to declare him he's here Jesus didn't walk on the water and say it was I or it will be I he said it is I Be not Afraid well is there anybody here tonight can say devil get out of my boat spirit of fear get out of my boat we're already in trouble we're already needing help amen and then all of a sudden here comes the message I'm preaching to you here comes the message walking on water and the devil gets in the boat and says it's a rocket ship it's a false opinion he's a plagiarist he didn't tell the truth he missed it here he missed it there and begins to bind your heart with fear to where you're afraid of the very thing that can help you can I say what brother Bram said he I got a clip but I'm catching a second wind he said they were they were afraid he said it was spooky yeah brother Mike it was spooky listen Jesus wasn't spooky the devil's interpretation to the Disciples of who was walking on the water was spooky and I'll just go ahead and say it amen there's been a lot of spooky stuff around this message there's been a lot of spooky doctrines and spooky ideas and spooky interpretations and spooky opinions but when it's all said and done when it's all said and done and you hear the voice behind the voice and he says Be not Afraid it is I the fear is rebuked the wind is calmed the rain is stopped the ship is anchored Oh Glory to [Applause] God fear not it is I Be not Afraid let our musicians come tonight Hallelujah you say brother [Applause] Andrew the devil wants to get you afraid of this message that's right now there's a lot of people that didn't get afraid God sent a prophet right brother Ray they sure got afraid when he started declaring the Revelation that's right but can I take this opportunity tonight to say thank God for our elders like Brother Ray thank God for Pioneers in this message that was in the ship and there was a lot of stuff going on but they looked out there and they said it's not spooky it's the message can I say this thank God for our brother ericon thank God for our brother bisc that went beyond just God send a prophet they said listen folks he had something to say God didn't just send a prophet the prophet had something to say and here's what he had to

Lord all across this building tonight are believers Lord father no matter how long we've been serving you how many years we've been in the position that you placed Us in in the church or as a lay member Lord where everyone where everyone subject sometimes to battle demons and spirits of fear and doubt they try to creep in through situations they try to creep in through problems they try to creep in through little things the devil throws our way and fear tries to creep out of it Lord father just as we just a few short years ago now seems like forever ago but it just was just a few years ago Lord when that virus broke out in our land and Lord I know that that was real we're not we're not into conspiracies and those things here tonight Lord we believe it was real but Lord we believe the spirit of fear that followed it was real too and Lord we've seen that spirit of fear begin to move into churches and begin to intimidate manipulate and try to destroy flocks and separate Shepherds from their flocks but Lord here we are four years later nearly and we're still standing we're still believing because Lord fear is defeated now Lord that was in the natural but as we move on in time
