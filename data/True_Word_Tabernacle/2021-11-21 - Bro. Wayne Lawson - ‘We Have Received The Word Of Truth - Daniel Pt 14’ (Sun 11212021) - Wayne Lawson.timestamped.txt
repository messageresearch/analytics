[1:51] Sunday morning what a time to serve the
[1:54] Lord amen it's a it's a terrible time in
[1:57] the world but it's a tremendous time in
[1:59] God
[2:00] amen and we just want to greet each one
[2:02] of you it's good to have our family here
[2:04] with us this morning and amen Vernon Dei

[2:09] blessing amen when you can get your
[2:11] family together and fellowship around
[2:13] the things of the Lord and amen we're uh
[2:16] praying for the brothers that's on the
[2:17] field this morning and amen but as we're
[2:20] here this morning we're trusting that
[2:22] the Holy Spirit would have something
[2:23] direct to your heart amen and we're
[2:26] asking for a real leadership in his word
[2:28] this morning so if we just bow our
[2:30] hearts together I just asked you if
[2:33] you'd pray with me and let's ask the
[2:35] Lord to do something special this
[2:37] morning for a heart
[2:39] father we greet you this morning Lord
[2:44] and we thank you for your divine
[2:46] presence in this building Lord as your
[2:49] anointing swirls around the room Lord
[2:51] and scriptures begin to roll Lord
[2:54] there's an answer for hearts Lord there
[2:57] is a God that
[2:58] lives father father we hunger for thee
[3:01] Oh Lord we' love to see it when Lord
[3:04] your spirit walks down the aisles and
[3:07] Lord opens the heart of your children
[3:09] and Lord you can only fix those little
[3:13] intricate things that are in the heart
[3:15] and maybe never discussed with another
[3:18] human but Lord you and you alone know
[3:20] the secrets in the mind of a man Lord
[3:24] and we're asking you this morning that
[3:26] you would divinely Lord move through
[3:29] this sanctu uary touching hearts and
[3:31] lives Lord father maybe questions that
[3:34] are there and desires Lord to be able to
[3:37] come higher in you and we're asking that
[3:40] your word would unlock those doors this
[3:42] morning Lord and father may you allow us
[3:44] a higher fellowship and worship with you
[3:47] Lord now as we commit this meeting in
[3:49] thy hands Lord we ask you to take it and
[3:52] use it for all your glory in Jesus name
[3:56] we pray amen amen and amen God bless you
[4:00] this morning and we'd like to turn into
[4:03] the word of the Lord if we could I'd
[4:05] like to look over in the book of
[4:06] Ephesians the first
[4:08] chapter and I want to read the 13th
[4:10] verse Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 and
[4:14] 14 amen uh what a what an amazing time
[4:18] to serve the Lord and I'm going to pull
[4:20] right out of the Book of Daniel for a
[4:22] service I'm sorry but yesterday the Lord
[4:24] just spoke something directly to my
[4:26] heart and we're going to try our best to
[4:27] follow that um we're uh we're uh we like
[4:32] him to have the ride away amen amen and
[4:36] uh so I want to I wanted to speak to you
[4:38] from this for a few minutes this morning
[4:40] the book of Ephesians the first chapter
[4:42] we'll read the 13th verse here in whom
[4:46] ye also
[4:48] trusted after that you heard the word of
[4:53] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[4:57] whom also after that you believed you
[5:01] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[5:04] Promise which is the
[5:06] earnest of our inheritance until the
[5:09] Redemption of a purchased possession
[5:11] unto the
[5:13] praise of his glory amen we ask the Lord
[5:16] to bless his word this morning you may
[5:18] be seated I want to take from that
[5:20] phrase this
[5:23] morning the word of truth I just uh the
[5:28] Lord just spoke something real directly
[5:30] to me yesterday
[5:32] morning and uh just as just as I was
[5:36] thinking in prayer and just something
[5:38] spoke directly to me you have received
[5:42] the word of Truth so I want to if I can
[5:46] just speak to you a little bit today and
[5:48] maybe a statement that we have received
[5:51] the word of Truth amen I think it's a
[5:55] powerful thing uh when you take it to
[5:57] the scripture and begin to study it what
[5:59] the word of truth actually means and
[6:01] what it is and what it gives to an
[6:04] individual um I I know that in the
[6:07] seasons that we are living in the hour
[6:09] that we live truth is a very uh it's a
[6:13] very um sacred thing and it's often not
[6:17] found in very many places truth is
[6:20] something that's been pushed to the
[6:21] borders uh for the sake of whatever
[6:24] reason popularity politics um directions
[6:28] but of course it's the Spirit of the
[6:30] enemy that is constantly trying to bring
[6:32] some type of confusement or some type of
[6:36] maybe not an an outright lie but maybe
[6:39] just enough to keep someone from a
[6:41] positive truth and that is Satan's
[6:44] objective even this morning is to be
[6:46] sure that we don't rest on a positive
[6:48] truth because when people who stand on
[6:51] Truth they stand up on the infallible
[6:54] word of God then those people are
[6:56] actually an invisible an invincible
[6:58] people and they cannot be defeated by
[7:01] standing on the word now in the
[7:04] Scriptures it is beautiful to see that
[7:07] Jesus himself tells us amen that he is
[7:11] the truth many people will ask us this
[7:14] uh in this age we're living really what
[7:15] is truth what uh who has truth what is
[7:18] truth and Jesus himself said in John 14
[7:22] he said I am the way I am the truth and
[7:27] I am the life amen so so the the way of
[7:31] God is the truth and Jesus is that way
[7:34] so I would easily say that Jesus is the
[7:37] truth that's what the truth is this
[7:39] morning you don't possess truth unless
[7:42] you possess Christ it's the only way to
[7:44] possess truth is to possess him you can
[7:46] read about him and you can read the
[7:49] truth but you can't actually have the
[7:51] truth until you receive the word of
[7:54] Truth in you which he is trth uh it's
[7:57] Jesus in John 177
[8:00] he said sanctify them through Thy word
[8:03] for Thy word is truth so now we're
[8:05] seeing that the word is trueth now it
[8:08] it's apparent that if you believe the
[8:11] word then in John chapter 8 and the 32nd
[8:14] verse the Bible said you should know the
[8:16] truth and the truth shall make you free
[8:20] so the truth is the way it's the way of
[8:22] life and it's also the way of Freedom if
[8:24] you're going to have freedom this
[8:26] morning it'll because you have truth
[8:28] there is no Freedom outside of truth if
[8:30] you don't own truth then you don't have
[8:33] true freedom because something is always
[8:36] influencing your mind it's influencing
[8:38] the way you go uh but when you have
[8:41] truth then you have Liberty you have
[8:42] real Freedom amen Jesus is the truth and
[8:46] if you continue in him you will actually
[8:49] have a liberty like you've never known
[8:51] now I know sometimes we think about the
[8:54] world that we're living in and the
[8:56] little um how could I say it in the
[8:58] world we're living in there is so many
[9:01] misrepresentations of Truth uh it's not
[9:04] that there is so many outright lies
[9:06] there's just not so many people telling
[9:08] exact Truth uh if you would maybe watch
[9:11] CNN or Fox News or one of the media
[9:13] sources you're not going to sometimes
[9:15] just hear exact lies but what you're
[9:17] hearing is a perverted truth in other
[9:20] words they'll take a half a statement or
[9:22] they'll take a little part of statement
[9:23] then they'll add a content to it that's
[9:25] not exactly right so then you have been
[9:28] given a falsehood In The Name Of Truth
[9:32] so all of a sudden now we we kind of
[9:34] have to Discount our media sources as a
[9:37] way of absolute truth we might receive
[9:40] some truth but absolute truth does not
[9:42] come through your television
[9:45] sets absolute truth doesn't come through
[9:48] your cell phones and absolute truth does
[9:51] not come in any other source outside of
[9:54] the Vindicated word of God in this
[9:57] season and if a person is going to be
[10:00] absolutely true then they're going to
[10:02] have to minimize the source of what they
[10:04] receive as truth down to the Vindicated
[10:08] word amen we're in that place in that
[10:10] hour where it is become a moment of
[10:13] truth is that right and if there is a
[10:15] moment of truth then God has a truth for
[10:18] that moment and that is the season that
[10:20] we're living in I would like to say that
[10:23] I I would join Apostle Peter when he was
[10:26] standing on the mountain with the Lord
[10:28] and and he had said seen the baptism of
[10:30] Jesus the disciples had all knew that
[10:32] John had declared that there had been a
[10:34] baptism of Jesus and a a great light had
[10:36] come down and said this is my beloved
[10:38] Son now that was a powerful point that
[10:41] this is my beloved Son amen but then it
[10:44] comes to mount Transfiguration where
[10:46] only about three men were allowed to go
[10:48] up with Jesus in this experience and
[10:51] while they were standing there the Bible
[10:52] said that a a cloud came down out of
[10:55] heaven and Jesus was transfigured before
[10:58] them and then it said this is my beloved
[11:01] Son hear ye him and now when Apostle
[11:05] Peter was in that experience he comes
[11:08] back in the book of Peter in the second
[11:10] chapter in the first verse and he begins
[11:12] to write about his experience and he
[11:15] said amen that we have not followed
[11:18] cunningly devised fables but we made
[11:21] known unto us by the power of the coming
[11:23] of our Lord Jesus Christ that we are
[11:25] eyewitnesses of his majesty in other
[11:28] words these people people like Apostle
[11:30] Peter was saying I was standing there
[11:33] when Jesus was transfigured before me
[11:36] amen and I'm not following some cunning
[11:39] devised Fable but I'm actually following
[11:41] truth and and he knew that he was behind
[11:45] exact truth it's a amazing because he
[11:48] said we have received from God the
[11:49] Father honor and glory and there came a
[11:52] voice from Heaven saying of the
[11:53] excellent Glory this is my beloved Son
[11:56] in whom I'm well pleased and this voice
[11:59] which came from heaven we heard were
[12:01] with him in the Holy Mountain and we
[12:03] also have a more sure word of Prophecy
[12:06] isn't that powerful a more sure word of
[12:10] Prophecy now you have to ask yourself
[12:12] what is a more sure word of Prophecy
[12:15] than Isaiah saying a virgin should
[12:17] conceive what is a more sure word than
[12:20] Isaiah 9 saying Emmanuel shall be with
[12:22] us a son shall be given what is a more
[12:25] sure word is when that word of Isaiah
[12:28] had become flesh and was standing right
[12:31] in front of apostle Peter and Not only
[12:34] was the flesh standing there God himself
[12:37] was vindicating that this was amen the
[12:41] flesh dwelling of Isaiah 9 and Isaiah 6
[12:44] and the Book of Ezekiel see the word of
[12:47] God had brought forth something into the
[12:50] flesh which bypassed all the questions
[12:53] of what Isaiah meant until that very
[12:56] hour what Isaiah meant had been a
[12:58] question it was a it was somewhere amen
[13:00] a lot of people could say Well it meant
[13:02] this and it meant this and it meant this
[13:04] but after Jesus came to the Earth to
[13:07] apply any other meaning to the book of
[13:09] Isaiah it would be sin after that it
[13:12] would be it would be an unbelief of the
[13:14] revealed word amen so God had given them
[13:18] exact truth or absolute truth and he
[13:20] said that it was a more sure word of
[13:22] Prophecy where un we take heed as a
[13:25] light that shineth in a dark place until
[13:27] the day Dawn and a day St arise in our
[13:30] hearts knowing this verse that no
[13:33] Prophecy of the scripture is in any
[13:36] private interpretation isn't that
[13:38] powerful and it's beautiful when you
[13:40] really come to that reality that the
[13:43] scripture is of no private
[13:45] interpretation in other words there's no
[13:48] churches has a right to interpret
[13:50] prophecy of scripture there's no group
[13:52] of men that actually has a right to say
[13:55] this is what this means and this is what
[13:57] this means but God alone reserves the
[14:00] right to interpret scripture by making
[14:03] that scripture manifested in the season
[14:06] that it's desired to be of God and in
[14:09] that season then truth comes forward and
[14:12] Truth is the interpreted word of God how
[14:15] many realizes that truth is embodied
[14:17] it's more than just a story or just a a
[14:20] scripture you read but truth becomes
[14:22] embodied in a people and those people
[14:25] become the extension of Truth by
[14:27] manifestation just as God had seed in
[14:31] other ages those seed amen you you look
[14:33] back and you say well Noah is the seed
[14:35] of God or you say Moses was the seed of
[14:37] God well they were the seed but do you
[14:39] know Jesus said in the Book of Luke that
[14:41] the seed is the word that's the parable
[14:44] so those men were not only seed they
[14:46] were the word but they wern't the word
[14:48] in a Bible they were the word manifested
[14:51] and they were manifesting truth under
[14:53] the light of the age they were living
[14:55] other people looked at that truth and
[14:57] they said well you're a Luna IC or
[14:59] you're a heretic or you're a crazy man
[15:01] but they were the Fulfillment or the
[15:03] interpretation of the scripture in the
[15:06] day that they're living in oh my amen
[15:09] there are a people today in this hour
[15:11] that don't just possess truth but they
[15:13] have become truth amen there is a truth
[15:16] in this Bible but there is a truth that
[15:19] is living Jesus said I am the way I am
[15:22] the truth and I am the L and if Jesus is
[15:25] in you this morning he didn't he didn't
[15:27] leave the Bible as truth and come into
[15:30] you as a lie but he would testify of the
[15:32] word in you the same as he testifies of
[15:35] the word in the Bible amen I believe
[15:38] amen that we are written Epistles of the
[15:40] word of God this morning I I don't
[15:42] believe that we just read the word and
[15:44] it stays there but we become the very
[15:47] word that we read Our Lives become the
[15:51] interpretation of the scripture itself
[15:54] now I I know that it's a powerful
[15:56] question what is truth now of course you
[15:59] got a right to ask that question and
[16:01] pilate did ask that in the Book of John
[16:04] the 18th chapter pilate said unto
[16:06] themart thou a king asking Jesus are you
[16:09] a king he says I am a king and to this
[16:12] end was I born and for this cause I came
[16:14] into the world that I should bear
[16:16] witness unto the truth and everyone that
[16:18] is of the truth heareth my voice and
[16:22] pilate said unto him what is truth amen
[16:26] what is truth amen think of that when he
[16:28] had said this he went out again to the
[16:30] Jews and said I don't find any fault in
[16:32] this man I don't find any lie at all in
[16:35] this man he is exactly what he confesses
[16:38] to be he he is telling truth and and of
[16:41] course pilate asked what is truth and I
[16:44] believe there's many people today asking
[16:46] the same question what is truth what is
[16:48] truth well I don't know of any truth
[16:50] outside of the word of God I just have
[16:53] to be honest with you I do not believe
[16:56] amen there is any truth outside of the
[16:58] word of God I believe everything else
[17:00] has a tinge or a Twist of somebody's
[17:03] idea or something of man put to it do
[17:06] you know the Bible said to let every
[17:08] man's word be a lie that the word of God
[17:10] would stand true do you know that the
[17:12] only truth you'll ever know is the word
[17:15] of God and that truth is a powerful
[17:17] truth over our lives it is a truth that
[17:20] has been declared now you can take truth
[17:22] in the Bible but by the time you get it
[17:25] out of the Bible it can become a
[17:27] lie that's right that's now that's a
[17:29] thought isn't it amen when the word
[17:32] becomes a lie how does that happen when
[17:34] man puts an interpretation to it now I I
[17:38] I've I've I've read enough of the
[17:39] scripture to understand that scripture
[17:42] uh scripture if it's in the wrong place
[17:46] is not the
[17:48] truth is that right now what would you
[17:52] think about me if I come this morning
[17:53] and said we all need to go build an
[17:56] ark I could take Noah's t testimony that
[18:00] it's time to build an ark the world
[18:01] would be destroyed by water and I could
[18:03] preach that to you as the gospel and
[18:05] what has been the truth is not the truth
[18:08] and I would be telling you an absolute
[18:10] Lie by using the Bible and doing so
[18:13] because amen the word has a season and
[18:17] in that season then that word is exactly
[18:19] true for That season amen I I I find
[18:22] this amazing that God has to declare
[18:25] what is Truth by the manifestation of
[18:28] his word and I believe this morning
[18:30] brother B says it like this he said the
[18:32] Lord your God has declared to you what
[18:34] is truth the Lord has Vindicated what is
[18:38] truth his word and by his Spirit see not
[18:41] by might or by power but by my spirit
[18:44] see and God seeks those who will worship
[18:47] Him in spirit and in truth and thy word
[18:50] is truth and he is Thoroughly a
[18:52] Vindicated that Jesus Christ is the same
[18:55] yesterday today and forever he has
[18:57] showed evening seed s to you he has
[19:00] revealed it to you in the word he has
[19:03] proven it to you by his Spirit now in
[19:06] the Paradox of course brother Ram talks
[19:08] a whole lot about Superstition uh
[19:11] there's different places in the message
[19:12] and I'll just carry you to a couple of
[19:14] them but out in Arizona there was a
[19:16] superstitious mountain where uh that
[19:18] there was a mountain everyone was afraid
[19:20] of because that there was a Superstition
[19:23] over that come from the Indians and
[19:25] everybody in the area believe those
[19:27] superstitions so when they approach that
[19:28] mountain they did it with fear but the
[19:31] fear was coming from Superstition now
[19:33] brother Ram said you had to show up at
[19:35] certain time of the morning to see the
[19:36] Superstition and he said when he got
[19:38] there it was long before daylight and he
[19:41] said he brought along a little
[19:42] flashlight with him and when he walked
[19:44] up to the mountain he said see my
[19:45] flashlight could only cover a certain
[19:47] portion of the Mountain at a time he
[19:49] said so every let me just paraphrase it
[19:52] everywhere the flashlight didn't shine
[19:54] Superstition would dwell see
[19:56] Superstition can dwell in the Dark
[19:59] Places every place that you don't
[20:02] understand scripture that's where
[20:03] Superstition is it's in that place of
[20:06] misunderstanding so Superstition will
[20:08] hide in that place but brother Ram said
[20:11] instead of approaching the Superstition
[20:13] with my little light he said what I did
[20:16] was backed off a few steps and just sat
[20:18] down and waited for the sun to rise
[20:21] because when the Sun rises up it's able
[20:23] to show the whole picture at one time
[20:27] amen do you see through the age men has
[20:29] approached god with a flashlight and
[20:31] they they found the truth and they found
[20:33] the truth but between all those places
[20:36] where where they misunderstood things
[20:38] but this end time bride has been able to
[20:41] take a seat until the rising of the Sun
[20:45] and when the sun begin to rise Now The
[20:47] Sun Shines on the entire mountain and
[20:50] the Mystery of godliness and and faith
[20:53] and virtue and see that whole statue of
[20:55] the perfect man we're seeing what it
[20:57] really means to be to be a Christian to
[20:59] be a believer we're seeing the end time
[21:02] events unfolding together we are not
[21:05] living in an age of supers we're living
[21:07] in a season of perfect Faith this is a
[21:10] season where the devil should not have
[21:12] one place to get into the Church of the
[21:15] Living God there ought to be a people
[21:16] alive this morning that should say to
[21:19] them it's not what Paul said we will not
[21:22] stand on it if it's not what the prophet
[21:24] said we will not stand on it there
[21:27] should be a word bride on the Earth
[21:29] today that will only receive the
[21:32] Vindicated word of the age we're living
[21:35] in we're too far past it friends this is
[21:37] no time to get your lines Tangled Up
[21:40] This is no time to get tangled up in
[21:42] politics and ideas and superstitions and
[21:45] and worldly things are you with me and
[21:48] denominational thinking concerning end
[21:50] time events we know where we're going we
[21:53] know where we're petted we know what the
[21:56] Vindicated word says about this season I
[21:59] know there's a third world World coming
[22:01] but we're not going to be here for it
[22:03] come on Church we're not going to be
[22:05] here for it before the bomb hits this
[22:07] America there'll be a bride setting in
[22:10] glory that's thus saith the
[22:14] Lord take the Shadows off of it take the
[22:17] fear out of the heart of the children of
[22:20] God let truth set us free from the truth
[22:23] from the from the things that man would
[22:25] do to us my when I look at it this
[22:28] morning this should Miss message should
[22:30] be the end of
[22:31] superstitions brother BR said I think it
[22:33] was a old Captain he said we were on the
[22:35] Sea on the ocean we were floating in a
[22:37] boat and got out away from the land a
[22:39] little bit and he said they were trying
[22:41] to put I actually was in Oregon one time
[22:43] and we were with Brother Rich Cobb and
[22:45] we've been out in the ocean we were
[22:46] trying to come back to Harbor and those
[22:48] guys watch the tide because there's just
[22:51] a little bitty spot that they can run
[22:52] that boat in them rocks they got to
[22:54] power right through those rocks they
[22:56] can't just drift up there cuz it the the
[22:58] the current will make them hit the Rocks
[23:00] so they got to power in that little key
[23:02] they got to power that boat right
[23:03] through that so they they they catch the
[23:05] tide right they know when to come back
[23:07] and all that stuff so they get right
[23:09] there in that key brother BR said there
[23:10] was a man he said he was out there and
[23:13] and and a storm had come up and the fog
[23:15] had settled down and everybody was
[23:17] trying to figure out how to get back to
[23:19] the shore see but that old Captain was
[23:22] seasoned enough to know you don't try to
[23:25] reach Shore with this kind of condition
[23:28] so he just backed up and said they said
[23:30] well what are you going to do he said
[23:31] we're going to wait till the sun comes
[23:32] up now when the sun comes up the fog
[23:35] will disappear and then you can easily
[23:38] get in that place see but as long as
[23:40] it's working under fear and under
[23:43] darkness and under foggy places you're
[23:45] going to crash your boats what's going
[23:47] to happen but if you'll just wait till
[23:49] the sun rises then you're able to go
[23:51] into that place and I believe in the
[23:54] season that we're living in amen we have
[23:56] come under the rising of the Sun and
[24:00] this bride knows exactly where to go and
[24:03] how to move her boat amen we're not
[24:06] living under superstitions now as long
[24:08] as it's in the book brother Ram says it
[24:10] can be
[24:11] questioned but when it's been made
[24:14] manifest but when it's been made
[24:16] manifest then the product of that he
[24:19] said it's then the light is on the word
[24:22] see now the word being Vindicated is the
[24:25] light of the spoken word of God now the
[24:28] the light of the spoken word of God God
[24:30] said let there be light now that was a
[24:33] word but when the sun come into
[24:35] existence that was a reality of the word
[24:39] so if let's let's just say let's just
[24:41] say there's a bunch of people standing
[24:42] around and God said let there be light
[24:45] people could have run around and said
[24:47] God said let there be light but until
[24:49] the sun appeared they could have said
[24:52] that means this and that means this and
[24:55] that means this and they could have
[24:56] quoted him forba him but only God had
[24:59] the meaning of what he said and when he
[25:02] spoke it then the Sun come into
[25:04] existence you don't have to ask what
[25:06] that meant anymore it's right there it
[25:09] comes up every morning it's a part of
[25:10] our Lives now it is a reality see the
[25:14] word spoken becoming a reality takes the
[25:17] questions off now in the church age book
[25:19] brother mam will tell us something
[25:20] that's powerful because one one of the
[25:23] things that we have in this end time is
[25:26] we have so many people uh coming up with
[25:29] so many absolutes of how to know we've
[25:32] been saved or how do we have the Holy
[25:35] Ghost how how what is the what is the
[25:37] absolute to that what does that mean to
[25:40] be saved or to have it if you belong to
[25:43] a certain maybe a certain denomination
[25:45] the absolute of Salvation would have
[25:47] your name on the book see if you don't
[25:48] do what we say we'll remove your name
[25:50] then you've lost your fail see but now
[25:52] I've got a problem with that one because
[25:55] you can't join the church
[25:58] the only way to get into the body is to
[26:00] be born in the body see I never joined
[26:02] the Lawson family I was born into that
[26:05] family now because I was born in there
[26:07] whe they want me in it or not they got
[26:10] me amen we're we're family amen that you
[26:14] can't choose your family brother
[26:15] Richard you amen when you're born you're
[26:19] just born amen whether that's a royal
[26:21] line or whatever it is you're birthed
[26:23] into that family you see now you know
[26:26] that when a child of God is has been
[26:28] birthed into the family he's a child of
[26:30] God then by birth so that's why
[26:33] sometimes maybe there's disagreements or
[26:34] whatever but we're brothers and we're
[26:36] sisters amen amen no different than the
[26:39] the household you were born in we have a
[26:40] household of faith and children are born
[26:43] into that season now now if if we we
[26:46] must have an absolute of what that means
[26:49] to be born or to have received the Holy
[26:52] Ghost otherwise you you're like the wind
[26:55] you one day you're saved next day you're
[26:56] not saved one day you got it next day
[26:59] you ain't got it amen and if you leave
[27:01] that up to individuals they'll make you
[27:04] a whole list of dos and don'ts and and
[27:06] if you then usually it's particular to
[27:08] one group you know they have each one
[27:10] has a little slant on what that means
[27:12] you do this you ain't got it you do that
[27:14] you got it and you don't do that you
[27:16] ain't got it and they got this whole
[27:17] list but I I i' I've been searching this
[27:20] Bible a long time I ain't found that now
[27:23] if you got it and you can bring it to me
[27:25] I I'll just go ahead and take it right
[27:27] now we can end the we can end the
[27:30] arguments but you see what the problem
[27:32] with that is is you got to be alive
[27:34] before you can live for
[27:36] God it wouldn't have been funny for
[27:39] Jesus to have took a list of dos and
[27:41] don'ts and laid it on the tomb of
[27:42] Lazarus but Lazarus couldn't have did or
[27:45] don't do nothing as long as he was in
[27:47] the grave but when he was alive then
[27:50] there was a life in him so what is it
[27:54] about a bunch of dead people doing or
[27:55] don't doing something what does that
[27:57] make a difference there has to be a life
[27:59] inside the believer that makes a person
[28:02] do what they do or don't do see what it
[28:05] is there's got to be an Evidence of the
[28:07] Holy Ghost now I I'll take it to the
[28:09] only truth I know the evidence of
[28:12] receiving the Holy Ghost today is the
[28:13] same as it was back in the days of our
[28:15] lord it's receiving the word of Truth
[28:18] for the day that you live
[28:21] in wo brother the evidence of the word
[28:25] is of the of the life or the Holy Ghost
[28:28] is receiving the word of Truth for the
[28:31] day you live in Jesus never did stress
[28:34] the importance of works as he did the
[28:36] word he knew that if people got the word
[28:39] The Works would follow the
[28:42] word now the word of truth brother Ram
[28:45] says it like this I Know Thy works perg
[28:47] and age if a man fears that he might not
[28:49] please God let him fulfill the word of
[28:51] God if a man uh wonders if he will hear
[28:53] those words wello my good and faithful
[28:56] servant let him fulfill the word of God
[28:58] in his life and assuredly he will hear
[29:01] those words of praise the word of Truth
[29:03] was the criteria then and it's the
[29:06] Criterion now there isn't another
[29:09] standard there isn't another Plum line
[29:12] as the world is going to be judged by
[29:14] one Christ Jesus even so is it going to
[29:17] be judged by the
[29:19] word amen now of course again Perman age
[29:23] I want to just read this to you before
[29:25] we continue remember now John the
[29:27] Baptist prophet messenger of his day was
[29:29] filled with the holy ghost from his
[29:30] mother's womb he was baptized in the
[29:33] Jordan uh the word of God Jesus it came
[29:36] to him the word always comes to truly
[29:38] spirit filled that is the evidence of
[29:41] being filled with the Holy Ghost that is
[29:43] what Jesus said would be the evidence he
[29:45] said I pray the father and he will send
[29:47] unto you another comforter and he'll
[29:48] abide with you even the spirit of Truth
[29:51] whom the world cannot receive now we
[29:54] know what the truth is in John 17 Thy
[29:58] word is true and he said you don't
[30:01] understand my speech because you cannot
[30:02] hear my word did you notice Jesus said
[30:05] that the world could not receive the
[30:07] Holy Ghost well in this verse I just
[30:09] read neither could they receive the word
[30:11] because the spirit and the word are one
[30:15] and if you have the Holy Spirit as the
[30:17] prophets the word comes to you you would
[30:21] receive it now you can tell quickly what
[30:25] kind of spirit is inside an individual
[30:28] when the word is given to you how you
[30:30] respond to that
[30:32] word you can jump and holler you can
[30:35] join a church you can pay your tith you
[30:37] can do anything else but when the word
[30:39] is given to you and something inside you
[30:42] will not agree with that word and you
[30:44] got to Buck up against it and you got to
[30:46] push that preacher till he agrees with
[30:48] you there's something wrong with the
[30:50] spirit in that man or woman the evidence
[30:54] of a truly Holy Ghost filled individual
[30:57] is a Spirit ready to receive the
[31:00] Vindicated word of God when the spirit
[31:03] of truth comes the word is come he will
[31:05] guide you into all the truth he will
[31:07] speak the word and show you things to
[31:09] come if you want to know carefully that
[31:11] Jesus did not say the evidence of being
[31:14] baptized with the Holy Ghost with
[31:15] speaking in tongues interpreting
[31:17] prophesying shouting or dancing he said
[31:20] the evidence would be that you would be
[31:22] in the truth and you would be in the
[31:24] word of God for your age evidence has to
[31:28] do with receiving the word isn't that
[31:31] powerful you said well brother Wayne
[31:33] have you switch directions on this
[31:34] absolutely not I don't believe that uh I
[31:38] don't believe that that shouting or
[31:40] rejoicing or healing is an Evidence of
[31:43] anything other than that God still works
[31:46] miracles but if the person doing the
[31:49] shouting the believing the healing amen
[31:51] the Vindication of that individual is
[31:54] his ability to adhere to the promises of
[31:57] the he's living in amen you you can
[32:00] shout and dance and deny the word and
[32:02] you are just another
[32:04] Judas are you with me you can worship
[32:07] and just be another Cain somebody said
[32:09] well how did Cain worship read your
[32:11] Bible he had an acceptable excellent
[32:14] sacrifice but Abel's was more excellent
[32:16] than Cain's because it was redone with a
[32:19] revelation do you see what it is you can
[32:22] set up an altar but if you don't rightly
[32:24] divide the word of God then your altar
[32:27] comes in effective in the presence of
[32:30] God there is only one way to have
[32:32] atonement there's only one way to have
[32:34] forgiveness it's to come to God a
[32:36] provided way and that way is the way of
[32:39] Truth Jesus said I am the way the truth
[32:42] and the life and outside of that truth
[32:45] your worship is in
[32:49] vain in vain do they worship me teaching
[32:52] for Commandments the seeds of
[32:55] discrepancy
[32:56] amen you know what I'm talking
[32:59] about listen to this word We Know Thy
[33:02] word and there is no other truth outside
[33:04] of that Thy word will become a reality
[33:07] to us today now saying you receive the
[33:10] Holy Ghost now watch now watch what'll
[33:12] happen the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[33:15] amen is not the way of receiving the
[33:17] Holy Ghost now amen isn't this powerful
[33:20] watch what's what's what's the
[33:22] foundational teaching here look how
[33:24] close amen look how close the scripture
[33:27] comes we just read to you having after
[33:30] that you heard after after that you have
[33:33] heard of the word of Truth The Gospel of
[33:35] your salvation do you know that because
[33:37] of the way that's written that after you
[33:40] have believed you were sealed with that
[33:41] Holy Spirit of promise there is entire
[33:44] denominations that teach amen that when
[33:46] you believe the word you got the Holy
[33:50] Ghost now I'm I'm getting serious
[33:53] because if that was just in the Baptist
[33:55] Doctrine that'd be one thing but that
[33:58] Baptist Spirit has tried to come right
[34:00] over in the message of the hour and if
[34:02] you want to get the Holy Ghost just
[34:04] believe what I'm saying believe my
[34:06] teaching believe my understanding and
[34:07] you got the holy ghost that is a lie
[34:10] straight out of the pits of hell it is a
[34:13] misrepresentation of Jesus's doctrine
[34:15] that you must be born again and if a man
[34:18] is going to be born again he's got to be
[34:20] born again by the Water by the blood and
[34:22] by the spirit he's got to be baptized by
[34:25] the Holy Ghost and if the Holy Ghost God
[34:28] and bring life inside a Believer he'll
[34:30] have to agree with the word of God and
[34:32] that is the evidence of the spirit amen
[34:35] I I I know that old Baptist Spirit tried
[34:37] to creep right in you wanton the Holy
[34:39] Ghost just lift your hand what a what a
[34:41] what a what a fallacy some say well
[34:44] that's the one of the Mysteries of the
[34:45] age brother Wayne to receive the Holy
[34:47] Ghost without sensation and then they go
[34:49] directly to Mary and Mary believe the
[34:52] angel and receive life now I I
[34:54] appreciate that that's the way that
[34:56] Jesus Come into the womb of Mary I got
[34:58] that amen but that's not the way Mary
[35:00] got into heaven do you see the lie
[35:03] that's behind that the Bible said amen
[35:05] that Mary was in the upper room Acts
[35:08] chapter 2 amen she was there when the
[35:10] Holy Ghost came and she got just as
[35:13] drunk as Peter and James and John and
[35:16] brother brandham said if God wouldn't
[35:18] let Mary in heaven without getting drunk
[35:21] in the Holy Ghost how is he going to let
[35:23] you in heaven without getting drunk in
[35:25] the Holy Ghost that don't bring a
[35:28] Baptist Doctrine for life and for
[35:31] measurements of truth I do not believe
[35:33] it I will contest it it is seeds of
[35:36] discrepancy and it has come to rip the
[35:39] Church of its power and of its strength
[35:42] my goodness what is it Jesus never
[35:45] taught that nonsense Peter never taught
[35:47] that nonsense and I I'm using the word
[35:50] nonsense because I'm being
[35:54] nice Jesus called now listen directly
[35:58] Jesus was not playing he said to the
[36:02] devil you're a
[36:03] liar Jesus didn't mince words Jesus
[36:06] didn't go around it and said well maybe
[36:08] that's not exactly right he said it's a
[36:11] lie come on now John chapter 8 Jesus
[36:14] called the devil a liar straight up he
[36:16] said you're a liar and the father of
[36:18] Lies he said and the reason that people
[36:21] can't receive me is because they are of
[36:24] their father now that's the truth amen
[36:27] amen e either either God's your father
[36:30] amen or the devil's your father and as
[36:32] long as you're living in this Natural
[36:34] Life the devil fathered you it's a
[36:37] hybridization it's a lie that you're
[36:40] living in nobody got to teach you to lie
[36:42] you can lie before you can talk and you
[36:44] could you could steal amen you little
[36:47] bitty kids can steal and lie and cheat
[36:49] nobody had to tell them that because
[36:51] they learned it from their first parent
[36:54] and their first parent is a hybrid thing
[36:57] that the the Bible said every man born
[36:59] of a woman's a few days in full of
[37:01] trouble the nature on the inside of
[37:03] them's wrong they can't do right if they
[37:05] want to every work that you have is an
[37:08] Abomination or a filthiness in the sight
[37:10] of God so Jesus the only man that was
[37:13] ever born right said you got to get
[37:15] right by getting a new birth and God has
[37:18] promised the church a perfect Nature by
[37:20] A Perfect birth of the baptism of the
[37:23] Holy Ghost there is no other life
[37:25] outside of Christ coming in Into the
[37:27] Heart amen now now it's a very a very
[37:30] timid thing because the Bible said have
[37:33] you received after that you have
[37:37] believed Now isn't that something
[37:39] because people say well you got it when
[37:41] you
[37:42] believed but that's not at all what the
[37:44] Bible says so to misinterpret the word
[37:48] makes the word a
[37:51] lie it's contrary to scripture now think
[37:55] of this because the scripture if you
[37:57] pull this up uh let's pull this up 2
[37:59] Timothy Chapter 2 and let's read the
[38:02] 15th verse here now the Bible said that
[38:05] we should
[38:06] study to show thyself approved unto God
[38:10] a Workman that needeth not be
[38:13] ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[38:16] truth but shun profane and vain Bings
[38:19] for they will increase more
[38:22] ungodliness and the word will as doeth a
[38:26] canker
[38:28] of whom hus and Philip
[38:32] philus canker that word canker in the
[38:34] Amplified is
[38:36] cancer isn't that wild and the word will
[38:39] eat after doth a cancer or a canker of
[38:42] whom hus what what that speaking of is
[38:46] brother Ram says cancer comes from a
[38:48] bruised cell remember that the body the
[38:52] Natural Body cancer comes from a bruised
[38:53] cell now there's a there's actually I
[38:56] was talking to sister then she helped me
[38:58] on this understanding but in your in
[39:00] your uh uh chemo your chemo like what
[39:03] what brother Ron would take that imuno
[39:04] therapy what's happening is your body
[39:07] won't fight cancer because it thinks
[39:10] it's your body so it won't actually
[39:12] attack it and it lets cancer grow
[39:14] because it don't think it's your body
[39:16] but chemotherapy they're giving them
[39:18] makes the body identify that cell broken
[39:20] cell as cancer so it makes it fight the
[39:23] thing see but without something to fight
[39:25] it what happens is a brw cell becomes
[39:27] bruised the rest of the body then is
[39:29] affected by that bruise and it starts
[39:31] putting out distorted cells into the
[39:34] rest of the body after a while the body
[39:35] can't live because of that bruise cell
[39:38] amen now that's exactly what things that
[39:41] are not scriptural do to a body of
[39:44] Believers amen when when one of your own
[39:46] gets a little distorted and they start
[39:48] puking out things that are not biblical
[39:51] amen it becomes as a caner as a cancer
[39:54] amen so so nobody wants to say that's a
[39:56] lie no nobody wants to stand up again
[39:58] nobody wants to be that person that
[40:00] calls that thing out and says that's
[40:02] exactly wrong amen but somebody better
[40:05] do it or the cancer will take over the
[40:09] body you see what he's saying to you and
[40:11] they would eat doeth a canker of whom
[40:13] hus and so in other words you just just
[40:16] hear this a couple times believe the
[40:17] word and you got the Holy Ghost now
[40:19] don't let no preachers bump that and let
[40:23] that go on for about five years or six
[40:26] and it won't be long and that'll be the
[40:27] standard
[40:30] teaching because the body will recognize
[40:33] it and one of its own ministers saying
[40:35] it nobody else
[40:37] is going to bump it so then it remains
[40:41] as a
[40:41] teaching and then it
[40:43] caners look is this do the canker of
[40:46] whom I mean watch the next verse here
[40:48] the 18th who concerning the truth of
[40:50] erid saying that Resurrection is already
[40:53] passing over through the faith of son
[40:54] what's that concerning the truth that a
[40:58] now look at that so the scripture is
[41:00] telling you these two men took a truth
[41:03] and misplaced it and made an error out
[41:05] of it isn't that something they truly
[41:08] believed in Resurrection but they took
[41:10] the resurrection and misplaced the
[41:12] resurrection and made an error out of a
[41:14] truth isn't it something take a great
[41:17] truth make an error out of that truth
[41:19] because they wasn't rightly dividing the
[41:22] truth now notice let's go back to this
[41:25] first portion of this I want to I want
[41:26] to just take this and I'll come right
[41:28] back but I I think this is powerful a
[41:31] powerful Point here uh let us study to
[41:34] show ourself approved I've got to come
[41:37] back and and pick this up I'm sorry this
[41:40] is too important to
[41:42] bypass
[41:44] uh let's look at this let's look at that
[41:46] word right there study thyself to show
[41:49] thyself approved that word approved in
[41:51] the Greek I'll spell it to you uh d o k
[41:55] i m o s de uh it's a Doos kind
[42:01] of kind of it's not absolute
[42:05] truth I'm going to spell it for you so
[42:08] you can get it look it up later it's in
[42:12] the Greek Lexicon Strong's number 1384
[42:15] look it up for
[42:16] yourself it means accepted pleasing
[42:21] acceptable now this is a powerful point
[42:24] in the ancient world there was no
[42:26] banking system as we know of today not
[42:28] like paper money money was made from
[42:30] metal heated under liquid poured into
[42:32] molds and then cooled when the coins
[42:34] were cooled it was necessary to smooth
[42:37] off the edges so the coins were uh
[42:39] comparatively soft and course many
[42:42] people shaved them closely in one
[42:45] century more than 80 laws were PA passed
[42:49] in Athens to stop the practice of
[42:51] Shaving down the coins that were in
[42:54] circulation but some of the money
[42:56] changers were Men of Integrity who would
[42:59] not accept no counterfeit money they
[43:02] were Men of Honor who put only genuine
[43:05] full- weighted money into circulation
[43:08] such men were called uh d o k i m oos or
[43:12] approved so when the scripture when Paul
[43:15] is saying show thyself approved he's
[43:16] talking to Timothy now he's saying unto
[43:19] him these guys out here that's making
[43:20] these coins and there are places where
[43:23] you can take a counterfeit corn and they
[43:26] won't weigh the thing thing they'll just
[43:28] put it back in circulation cuz it don't
[43:29] matter to them they don't care to put
[43:32] things in circulation that's not exactly
[43:34] right but there were men who were
[43:37] approved Men of Integrity that when you
[43:40] brought to them a coin that was shaved
[43:42] see the the Shaving of those coins they
[43:45] could look at them coins it wouldn't
[43:46] show the Shaving you couldn't look at it
[43:48] with a natural eye and see it was shaped
[43:50] you actually had to weigh that coin to
[43:52] know that there had been any shaving
[43:53] done on the coin so the only way you can
[43:55] do it is weigh it in if you weighed the
[43:57] coin then you would know it's out of
[43:59] circulation amen but but think about
[44:01] this now because I I know exactly what
[44:04] this is saying from here because if
[44:06] there is going to be someone who is told
[44:09] by Paul to divide the word and to keep
[44:12] the stuff out of circulation then he was
[44:15] telling Timothy it's already happening
[44:17] Timothy it's already taking place or he
[44:19] wouldn't be telling him to watch the
[44:21] Shaving of the coins and to be sure that
[44:25] you don't rreach or regur itate things
[44:28] that have been shaved down to match
[44:30] doctrines of other people I tell you
[44:32] what you're going to have to make up
[44:33] your mind you're going to be a voice of
[44:35] God or a voice of the people you're
[44:37] going to be a voice of God or you're
[44:39] going to be a voice of ideas and the
[44:40] voice of others amen I I just make
[44:43] something clear this morning this
[44:44] ministry the Lord has given me ever how
[44:46] small or ever how big is not for anybody
[44:50] to use other than this message amen I
[44:52] will not propagate I will not prop up I
[44:55] will not push Doctrine of man and ideas
[44:58] of man amen no matter force is going to
[45:01] do it you can tell me I'm going to put
[45:03] you out do whatever you can do whatever
[45:04] you want amen but I will consecrate
[45:07] myself to the message of the hour and
[45:10] it's the only thing that I'm willing to
[45:12] speak or preach now I say that because I
[45:14] believe amen we're living in a season
[45:17] now you you you probably think well
[45:18] brother Wayne's crazy well I've been on
[45:20] the field 25 years so I think I've been
[45:22] tried about every which way could be
[45:23] tried I've heard about every Doctrine
[45:26] you could hear I heard it from some from
[45:28] very powerful men and they they put a
[45:30] little pressure on you if you if you
[45:32] just bend a little we we'll we'll give
[45:34] you this so we'll do this amen but if
[45:36] it's ever been revealed to you what
[45:38] truth really is there will be an
[45:40] unmovable Faith inside your heart amen I
[45:43] am of the I'm in the place right now
[45:46] that I would rather stand on a rock on a
[45:48] creek bank and preach the truth of this
[45:51] message and to preach in the biggest
[45:53] coliseums the world has to offer amen I
[45:56] am not in a position Amen to trade my
[45:59] Truth for a little bit of peace with
[46:01] somebody's ideas about whatever they
[46:04] have now now I'm I've come to a place in
[46:06] my life I've had it tried every which
[46:08] direction there's people come to me one
[46:09] time a great I praise God I'm just going
[46:12] to have to preach but gu comes to me and
[46:14] says to me he said well brother Wayne he
[46:15] said I want you to know he said there's
[46:17] just one God Amen brother he said but
[46:20] there's two Lords I said no way
[46:23] sir look how done it one God but there's
[46:25] two Lords what a
[46:27] lie Paul said there is one Lord one
[46:31] faith and one baptism now how you going
[46:33] to use that scripture with that idea I
[46:36] tell you what you're going to do you're
[46:37] going to bypass it you're going to
[46:39] bypass it not read it or not talk about
[46:41] it but if you study to show yourself
[46:43] approved now there's a lot of things I
[46:45] could bring as examples and I'm not
[46:46] going to but I think you get the point
[46:49] amen I I I I have to speak the things
[46:51] that are true and the things that are
[46:53] solid he said that we should study to
[46:55] show oursel approved nothing other words
[46:57] that we wouldn't be ashamed Amen in
[46:59] other words that we wouldn't shave down
[47:01] things and then repr preach them to the
[47:03] people amen the price of Salvation has
[47:06] not changed the cost of Revival has not
[47:09] changed the way of Truth has not changed
[47:12] we cannot shave this down or water this
[47:15] down and make this a little better a
[47:17] little easier to believe we can't change
[47:20] it for our next Generations or what it's
[47:22] going to be if we do not hold this word
[47:25] of Truth as an absolute where are we
[47:27] going to find one if we don't remain
[47:29] with the standard of this message where
[47:31] are we going to get one amen I tell you
[47:33] what it is there's people trying to
[47:34] change the gopost on this
[47:36] message yeah my goodness I don't mean to
[47:38] get in these things but I'm just going
[47:40] to preach to you it's one thing to
[47:41] trespass on my property it's another
[47:44] thing to try to build a fence in the
[47:45] wrong place come on church amen it's one
[47:48] thing somebody somebody get out and they
[47:50] do a little something wrong and they
[47:51] kind of Shame facedly said but way I
[47:53] know that wasn't exactly right and I'm
[47:54] sorry shouldn't probably done that amen
[47:57] I I I'm okay with that I can we can
[47:58] handle it we can forgive you forgive me
[48:00] we can go on down the street everybody's
[48:02] trespassed the word amen but when you
[48:04] start changing the property corners and
[48:07] you start saying that ain't wrong no
[48:08] more or this is wrong and that's right
[48:10] it ain't wrong amen there's something
[48:12] somewhere there got to be a surveyor
[48:15] somewhere and STS the old Corners back
[48:18] and says we're not budging off of the
[48:20] land that God gave us in this generation
[48:23] there are people sitting here today that
[48:25] have Stak their life on thus sayith the
[48:28] Lord and that's exactly where we got to
[48:30] stand and exactly where we'll be now the
[48:33] Bible said that a Workman who would
[48:35] study who is approved would not have any
[48:37] need to be ashamed brother B said the
[48:39] reason people are ashamed is because
[48:41] they're not sure of
[48:43] it they're not sure of it or they're
[48:45] embarrassed by it amen what is it
[48:48] they're ashamed because they're not sure
[48:50] what they're talking about is the truth
[48:52] they're not sure they've not been to the
[48:54] place where they can promise you without
[48:56] one Shadow of Doubt that that is the
[48:58] truth but when a man ever Goes On The
[49:01] Backs side of the desert and he ever
[49:03] meets God in that kind of way there's
[49:06] nothing that'll ever take it out of his
[49:07] life there's nothing that will ever move
[49:10] that man amen now I I I think of this
[49:14] now now we we look at this this morning
[49:16] if you want to read a message in 65
[49:18] called seed of discrepancy brother bam
[49:21] says Jesus he tells a parable in Matthew
[49:24] 13 and talks about the seed of the swer
[49:27] and he says that one seed was the seed
[49:28] of God the other seed was the seed of
[49:30] the enemy he said now the seed of
[49:32] discrepancy is anything contrary to the
[49:36] word so anything contrary to the word is
[49:39] a
[49:41] discrepancy anything that's contrary to
[49:44] the word is a Discord among the Brethren
[49:47] isn't it amazing how important it is
[49:50] just to say what the prophet
[49:52] said now look at this because born to
[49:55] the spirit of God by the Holy Ghost and
[49:57] the seed word manifesting that's the
[49:59] genuine seed of God but the enemy can
[50:02] join the church and become Orthodox and
[50:04] a Creed but that's a discrepancy
[50:06] anything that interferes with the strain
[50:08] of genuine truth of God's word well
[50:12] that's powerful ain't it only a prophet
[50:14] can say it like that the strain of
[50:17] Truth anything that interferes with the
[50:20] strain of Truth see with the strain of
[50:23] genuine truth of God's word you've got
[50:25] to get right to interpret no man has a
[50:27] right to interpret God's word he promis
[50:29] it he does it interpretation he promised
[50:31] he interpretation anything contrary to
[50:33] God's word is a discrepancy absolutely
[50:36] now Judas had no real Faith he was a
[50:39] make-belief faith now the faith he
[50:42] thought that he that that was the son of
[50:44] God but he didn't know that was the son
[50:46] of God or he wouldn't have done it and a
[50:49] man who will compromise on the word of
[50:51] God being the truth he's got to make
[50:53] believe faith
[50:57] man that's that's getting tight there
[50:59] ain't
[51:00] it if you compromise on this
[51:03] truth that's a make believe
[51:06] faith if you compromise if you're in a
[51:09] position of compromise let's just
[51:11] compromise that is a make belief Faith
[51:15] because true faith cannot compromise
[51:17] because it's on the word of God see the
[51:20] man's word now you said well brother
[51:22] Wayne I don't really see how that this
[51:25] message it how is the word of God well
[51:28] now I I I tell you I can I can take you
[51:30] into the Bible and you you you use the
[51:32] Bible quite well and quote it and I
[51:33] think it's powerful I think this Bible
[51:35] is the only absolute truth in the world
[51:38] Amen but but the Jews will call it the
[51:41] Books of
[51:42] Moses so it was actually written by a
[51:45] man but the man was speaking for God so
[51:49] what we find then is that the man was a
[51:53] veil but the words he spoke was God
[51:57] brother brandom says it like this he
[51:59] said the spirit of God could form in
[52:01] what we called a prophet and the word of
[52:03] the Lord came to this man so it wasn't
[52:05] the Prophet The Prophet was the veil but
[52:08] the Word was God now the man's word
[52:11] won't act like
[52:13] that do you see that a man's word won't
[52:16] act like God's word will a man can say
[52:18] well this is going to happen and it
[52:20] don't happen a man could say well this
[52:22] is going to be this way and this is
[52:23] going to and it ain't that way because a
[52:25] man has the ability to lie or to miss it
[52:28] but God cannot lie so if God speaks it
[52:34] it's his word and it has to act exactly
[52:37] it has to act exactly like it was now
[52:40] there are people that propose that what
[52:41] brother randam says is is just the ideas
[52:44] of a man but brother maram says it like
[52:46] this he said I'm thoroughly convinced
[52:48] that my message comes from God I'm
[52:50] thoroughly convinced it's not my own
[52:52] fleshly mind puffed up it's the word of
[52:54] God I'm thoroughly convinced and
[52:56] absolutely convinced that Jesus Christ
[52:58] is the same yesterday today and forever
[53:01] I'm C fly convinced that he's here right
[53:05] now again God's power to transform we
[53:08] are privileged people that God has
[53:10] chosen of the earth that we might see
[53:12] and understand these things which is not
[53:14] some mythical fleshly Mind of a person
[53:17] trying to get made it up it's the word
[53:20] of God manifested and been proven that
[53:23] it's right do you see what it is if it's
[53:26] God's word it'll Stack Up on the rest of
[53:28] the
[53:29] word it it won't break the strain of the
[53:32] word see to break a strain you take you
[53:34] as a human being when you were born you
[53:37] just went from Human to human both of
[53:39] your parents were human at least I hope
[53:40] they
[53:42] were
[53:43] so it has to go from Human to human you
[53:46] see you don't start out a cat and end up
[53:48] as a dog you don't start as a dog and
[53:51] end up as an elephant you start out as a
[53:53] human and become a human because it's
[53:55] just cell built upon on Cale when when a
[53:57] child is first uh first conceived it's
[54:00] it's just just it's just a little germ
[54:02] it's microscopic amen but it ain't long
[54:04] cell human cell on human cell begins to
[54:07] develop things I think one of the first
[54:08] thing that a baby develops is a
[54:19] backbone well I mean let that soak in a
[54:23] minute but it all forms around that
[54:27] right amen but but you see word cell
[54:30] begins to be word cell until you have a
[54:33] mature child it it's word to word so
[54:37] what you're seeing is is the message of
[54:39] the hour isn't something besides the
[54:43] word it's only building on the word word
[54:46] by word you see it's only a bringing to
[54:50] Perfection the thing that God began in
[54:52] the beginning it's the word of Truth
[54:54] absolutely straight see human being to
[54:58] human being and when a man is born to
[55:00] the spirit of God he don't inject
[55:02] anything into its life it's
[55:03] unadulterated word of God Vindicated for
[55:06] that hour other words when you're born
[55:08] again you're not going to bring a Creed
[55:09] into that it' be like a baby trying to
[55:11] bring cat life into its into its
[55:14] existence to develop some hybrid
[55:16] something but if a man is a man only man
[55:19] life comes into him and so is it with
[55:22] the Holy Ghost if you have been born
[55:24] again it'll be word upon word upon word
[55:27] look at look in the Book of James I love
[55:29] this in the Book of James in the first
[55:31] chapter in the 18th verse he said of his
[55:33] own will begat he us with the word of
[55:36] truth that we should be kind to the
[55:37] first fruits of his
[55:39] creatures of his own will he begat us I
[55:42] like how One writer says it he says the
[55:45] father acted deliberately of a set
[55:47] purpose of his own will he begot us
[55:50] another words God deliberately did this
[55:52] he didn't he didn't partially do this he
[55:55] deliberately done this and God has by
[55:58] his own will begot a children of God
[56:01] that would stay with his words in the
[56:03] samna age brother brandom tells us even
[56:05] our even the thoughts of God are Eternal
[56:07] and if you can see this you'll see many
[56:09] things if you can see that God's
[56:12] thoughts are Eternal you'll see many
[56:14] things because before they were a word
[56:16] they had to be a thought and that
[56:18] thought was God so now when it's
[56:20] manifested it's the word and becomes the
[56:22] word of God we got we got a lot of
[56:24] scriptures on it I'll not talk take time
[56:26] to read all them but look at this he
[56:28] said he begat Us in the Book of James by
[56:31] his own will he begat us with the word
[56:34] of Truth he begat us with the word of
[56:37] Truth in Acts 17 it's Paul that says
[56:40] even your poets taught that we are The
[56:43] Offspring of God even The Poets would
[56:45] teach We're The Offspring of God so that
[56:47] the deity shouldn't be explained in
[56:49] Idols it should be brought into Humanity
[56:52] amen according to First John the Bible
[56:54] says as many as receive him to them he
[56:57] gave power to become the sons of God to
[56:59] them that believe upon his name which
[57:01] were born not of blood nor the will of
[57:03] Flesh nor the will of man but of God see
[57:06] so after you have heard the word of
[57:09] truth then you are sealed by the spirit
[57:11] of promise and brought into Christ see
[57:15] listen I'll tell you if you're in Christ
[57:17] you are a new
[57:19] creature you have been recreated it is a
[57:22] new creation Now somebody said well
[57:25] brother Wayne what do you mean New Birth
[57:26] well I think it's powerful because we've
[57:28] not been born under Pentecost we've not
[57:31] been birthed under Lutheran we've not
[57:34] been birthed as a Wesleyan we've been
[57:36] birthed under the message of the hour
[57:39] and according to Malachi 4 that parent
[57:42] would be a restored word of God there is
[57:45] a parent of the church now there is a
[57:47] there's a parent and it matters who your
[57:49] parents are of how you act it'll
[57:51] influence your birth it'll influence
[57:53] what you do it's according to who your
[57:55] parents are and I believe there's a
[57:57] church today that has a parent of the
[57:59] infallible word of God now I know
[58:02] there's a lot of problems and I know
[58:03] there's a lot of situations but one
[58:05] thing that I know God will still bring
[58:07] the direct word to his church who
[58:09] desires that word brother mam says that
[58:12] when a child begins to be developed as a
[58:15] child is wanting to be developed the
[58:17] mother in the in the womb the child in
[58:19] the womb begins to call for things that
[58:21] the mother will ask for is that right
[58:24] and if there is a deep to desire that
[58:27] there's a deep to meet that if a mother
[58:29] says I want watermelons and pickles
[58:31] somewhere in this world there's
[58:32] watermelons and pickles and there's a
[58:35] father somewhere to get those
[58:36] watermelons and pickles amen because
[58:38] they want the child to be born perfectly
[58:41] and if that is in the natural what about
[58:43] in the spiritual brother man said then
[58:45] if there's a body somewhere that wants
[58:47] to come into Perfection then God will
[58:50] call somebody on the platform to preach
[58:53] absolute truth because that's the desire
[58:56] of the church is absolute truth not part
[58:59] truth not maybe truth not hope so truth
[59:02] but what is the absolute truth of the
[59:05] word of God I believe today there is an
[59:07] absolute truth I believe we can be born
[59:10] to the word of God not born of
[59:12] somebody's ideas or some system or some
[59:15] denomination but a birth amen a birth
[59:18] that is in the word of God Amen of his
[59:20] own will he has gave us a birth by the
[59:23] word of Truth so that we can be first
[59:25] fruit
[59:26] I love how the Amplified says it an
[59:29] example of what God has created and set
[59:31] apart to himself for a Divine
[59:34] Purpose that God has birthed this church
[59:36] for a Divine Purpose he's birthed you as
[59:39] an individual for a set aart Divine
[59:42] Purpose in other words God has got to
[59:44] have a second Eve God has got to birth a
[59:47] second Eve somebody is going to be a
[59:50] second Eve he said preacher what are you
[59:51] getting at I'm getting at that first Eve
[59:54] did something really wrong she lets
[59:57] somebody give her 99% word and 1% idea
[1:00:01] and that birth troubles the entire world
[1:00:04] today because you received something
[1:00:07] that wasn't absolutely true then that
[1:00:09] birth was distorted and came come out of
[1:00:12] that think about it this morning church
[1:00:14] we're not here to give birth to ideas of
[1:00:17] man we're not here to produce something
[1:00:19] like that it brings trouble but if we
[1:00:22] would stay absolutely with the word of
[1:00:24] God there is peace and joy and grace and
[1:00:27] mercy in the house of God my amen I
[1:00:30] believe it this morning I believe that
[1:00:32] we can be born again not of corruptible
[1:00:34] seed but of Incorruptible be born by the
[1:00:38] word of God be born by the word of God
[1:00:40] how are you birthed by the word says
[1:00:42] amen how could you even get started
[1:00:44] unless you was the word to begin with
[1:00:46] amen how do you start unless you were
[1:00:48] God Gene to begin with how could God put
[1:00:51] word on word unless there was word to
[1:00:53] begin with but because before before you
[1:00:56] were here you were a part of him there
[1:00:59] that way he set that part of him inside
[1:01:02] you and when this word begin to be
[1:01:05] preached it could be added word to word
[1:01:08] and Life to life until there was
[1:01:10] something that built sell upon sell my I
[1:01:13] I I I I can't help it this morning I
[1:01:15] think of a people that's received the
[1:01:17] truth and the hour We're living we're
[1:01:19] not just another church where sale upon
[1:01:22] sale word upon word life upon life the
[1:01:25] very Vindicated word of the age we're
[1:01:28] living in I've read in the Bible the
[1:01:31] word but now we're looking at the word
[1:01:34] the people that's received the word has
[1:01:36] become the word the very flesh of the
[1:01:39] word of God oh my I I I I just can't
[1:01:43] hardly help it Church the election grace
[1:01:45] of God that's upon your life election
[1:01:48] Grace that made you call that lie it
[1:01:51] made you spit out that lie it made it
[1:01:53] where it couldn't stick to your life
[1:01:55] pattern oh it might have influenced you
[1:01:57] a little while somebody might have
[1:01:59] brought you a certain place for a little
[1:02:00] while but after a bit the truth began to
[1:02:03] push out the ARs and all of a sudden the
[1:02:06] seed took over in your life and when it
[1:02:09] did oh I I love how brother BR says it
[1:02:11] he said it pushes out all the other
[1:02:13] seeds because you're sealed in the womb
[1:02:16] you are sealed to the word of God and
[1:02:19] can't receive nothing else amen what are
[1:02:21] we receiving this morning we are
[1:02:23] receiving a Vindicated truth in the
[1:02:26] we're living in I've never met any other
[1:02:28] preacher I've never seen another
[1:02:30] preacher that could stand like brother
[1:02:32] random did when he got done preaching a
[1:02:34] sermon he could stand there and say if
[1:02:37] what I said is the truth then let God
[1:02:40] come and vindicate it there's not
[1:02:42] another preacher ever lived that God
[1:02:44] would come and vindicate what they said
[1:02:47] at the end of their book and now we got
[1:02:49] people thinking they can go through the
[1:02:51] books and add this way and take that way
[1:02:53] but listen church God has v indicated
[1:02:56] this message as an absolute vinding
[1:02:58] truth and we have received it we have
[1:03:01] received it with our hearts we have
[1:03:03] received it with our life which is the
[1:03:05] evidence of the Holy Ghost my you want
[1:03:09] an Evidence this morning that Satan
[1:03:11] cannot shake there's something in you
[1:03:13] that has received amen the word of Truth
[1:03:16] not a lie not a word misrepresented I I
[1:03:20] know people think sometimes I I want to
[1:03:22] take a couple places here but sometimes
[1:03:24] people think we're we're in say but the
[1:03:26] way we believe this message but can I
[1:03:28] say this this is not a cult this is not
[1:03:31] fanaticism these are men that is not
[1:03:33] ashamed to preach this because they have
[1:03:36] rightly divided the word of Truth
[1:03:39] everybody says the Bible is truth but
[1:03:41] you could take the Bible and preach
[1:03:43] alive with the Bible I'll take I I'll
[1:03:46] just take a couple places maybe you can
[1:03:48] maybe you can uh just take from this
[1:03:49] what I'm trying to say what about if you
[1:03:51] go to the Book of Genesis and you go to
[1:03:53] Genesis the 4th chapter and the Bible
[1:03:55] says there in Genesis 4 that Adam knew
[1:03:57] his wife amen and she conceived and bear
[1:04:00] forth a son Abel and then again she bear
[1:04:03] Cain and most anybody will read that and
[1:04:06] say that Adam and Eve had two children
[1:04:08] Cain and Abel amen but if you don't
[1:04:10] rightly divide that you'll accept that
[1:04:13] as the truth when it is not the truth
[1:04:16] the Bible does say the Bible does say
[1:04:19] that Eva is the mother of all living but
[1:04:21] it never said that Adam was the father
[1:04:23] of Cain matter of fact it says opposite
[1:04:26] of that and he said Cain was of that
[1:04:28] evil one is that right then Cain's
[1:04:31] father was the devil somebody said well
[1:04:32] how'd you get that well the Bible will
[1:04:35] tell you if you just read
[1:04:37] it he said preacher how you getting that
[1:04:39] well now now if something happened to
[1:04:42] you and we wanted to know what happened
[1:04:44] couldn't we ask
[1:04:45] you so when God asked Eve in Genesis 3
[1:04:50] what happened remember CU he asked Adam
[1:04:52] he said it was the woman so the Lord
[1:04:53] looked at the woman and said what
[1:04:54] happened when he said what happened she
[1:04:56] said the serpent begal
[1:04:58] me so what did Eve say happened the
[1:05:02] serpent begal me now if you got a
[1:05:04] slithering snake on the ground talking
[1:05:06] and and and having seductive things with
[1:05:08] a woman you you're crazier than I
[1:05:10] thought you
[1:05:11] were you call me crazy and you got a
[1:05:14] slithering snake talking out of an apple
[1:05:16] tree having seduction with a woman that
[1:05:18] can have a child come on the Beast was a
[1:05:21] man without a soul he was the closest
[1:05:24] thing there was to a human being and he
[1:05:26] was on the upright and he was talking
[1:05:29] and he was seducing a Woman by
[1:05:31] misrepresenting the word but God cursed
[1:05:33] him for doing it and put him on his
[1:05:35] belly and made the dust his meat and
[1:05:38] that's why we're here today and unless a
[1:05:40] prophet would have come Church the
[1:05:43] absolute truth would have never been
[1:05:45] told on that story but this morning we
[1:05:47] have an absolute truth and we're not
[1:05:50] budging on that
[1:05:52] truth you see what I'm saying Ephesians
[1:05:54] 1 tells you a truth after you believe
[1:05:57] people put it since you believe when you
[1:05:59] believed you got it but that wasn't what
[1:06:01] the scripture said now you take that
[1:06:03] same thing go to the Book of Matthew
[1:06:05] Jesus's own words going to have a
[1:06:07] baptism right here this morning Jesus's
[1:06:09] own words said go ye unto the world and
[1:06:12] preach the gospel baptizing them in the
[1:06:14] name of the father and of the Son and
[1:06:16] the Holy Ghost and 300 years they did
[1:06:19] exactly that they did exactly that from
[1:06:22] acts the 2 chapter the Bible said that
[1:06:24] they were every one baptized in the name
[1:06:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ but after 300
[1:06:30] years the death of Christ they come
[1:06:32] along and I see or n of France I believe
[1:06:35] it was and they had themselves a counsel
[1:06:38] and when they had that counsel they
[1:06:39] changed that baptism and made it a
[1:06:41] trinitarian Doctrine and now when you
[1:06:44] were baptized you were baptized in the
[1:06:46] name of father in the name of son the
[1:06:48] name of Holy Ghost and you were put into
[1:06:50] the Fellowship of the church not into
[1:06:52] the body of Christ you were baptized
[1:06:55] into their Doctrine and their Fellowship
[1:06:57] you are not a Christian by that baptism
[1:07:00] come on church because they were Mis
[1:07:03] divided the word they brought you to the
[1:07:05] tree of knowledge rather than the tree
[1:07:07] of life but the tree of life has always
[1:07:10] been Revelation and God is the only one
[1:07:13] that can give Revelation and'll help a
[1:07:15] man rightly divide the word he said
[1:07:18] preacher what are you saying I'm saying
[1:07:19] the tree of knowledge and the Tree of
[1:07:21] Life Is Right In the Bible he gave you
[1:07:23] Matthew 28 he gave you Acts 2 which one
[1:07:25] one you're going to feed
[1:07:28] from now think of that because it's
[1:07:31] scripture but misrepresented you're
[1:07:34] believing in three Gods which breaks the
[1:07:36] very first commandment of God have no
[1:07:38] other
[1:07:40] God can you imagine someone using
[1:07:42] scripture to make a trinitarian God out
[1:07:44] of our god making us Heathen by nature
[1:07:47] and by
[1:07:49] faith but because of a
[1:07:53] prophet he rightly divided them that and
[1:07:56] now you sit here this morning and it's
[1:07:59] Sunday school
[1:08:01] lesson because you've received the word
[1:08:04] of Truth now it's a Sunday school sermon
[1:08:07] it's not even not even it's it's not
[1:08:09] even hardly a wow anymore over
[1:08:12] it well the greatest and Powerful most
[1:08:14] great truths that ever struck the Earth
[1:08:16] was the truth of the
[1:08:19] godhead but we have been so absorbed by
[1:08:21] it it's our nature and our thinking and
[1:08:23] we wonder why did anybody ever think
[1:08:24] anything different
[1:08:30] but a hundred years ago it was the
[1:08:32] battle it was a
[1:08:34] Battlefront you see what it was but
[1:08:37] something happened and we received we
[1:08:40] receiv received the word of
[1:08:43] Truth rightly divided
[1:08:46] word rightly divided word you you can
[1:08:49] take you could take the
[1:08:51] scripture and make it say things it
[1:08:53] don't say
[1:08:57] it's seed a discrepancy to do it sir
[1:09:00] there's three things you must not
[1:09:03] do Christ revealed in his own word you
[1:09:05] must not do
[1:09:06] it you must not misinterpret it you must
[1:09:10] not mislocate it and you must not
[1:09:12] misplace it to do so is the same sin
[1:09:16] that Eve committed in the Garden of Eden
[1:09:18] hallu it's the same sin you can paint it
[1:09:21] any way you want
[1:09:22] to you can you can prop it up
[1:09:25] you can paint it up you can try to back
[1:09:28] it up it's the seed of discrepancy the
[1:09:30] same thing if it caused that in the
[1:09:33] garden it'll cause that now it's death
[1:09:36] to do it it's separation from the word
[1:09:39] of God and anything that separates from
[1:09:41] the word do you see what we've received
[1:09:44] we have received
[1:09:46] truth oh and I think if there's any
[1:09:49] generation that's going to hold on to it
[1:09:51] I think we better hold on
[1:09:55] about to get rough it's about to get
[1:09:56] become a rough ride Church you better
[1:09:59] hold on to
[1:10:00] truth we have
[1:10:02] received we have received the word of
[1:10:04] Truth won't you stand to your feet with
[1:10:06] me I'm sorry I've I've went a lot I've
[1:10:10] got a whole lot more than I had time so
[1:10:11] I'm not finished even close
[1:10:14] but
[1:10:20] I I could pre I could preach a series on
[1:10:23] it and I don't want to do it this
[1:10:24] morning so
[1:10:29] so by the way how should these things be
[1:10:32] divided you know the beautiful thing is
[1:10:35] it's already been
[1:10:40] divided so we don't have to pick through
[1:10:42] it I I've told I've told through the
[1:10:44] years because you know hillbilly has
[1:10:46] hillbilly ways and but my granddad he
[1:10:49] was a commercial fisherman his kids and
[1:10:52] brother Vernon back here he's done
[1:10:53] running Nets and trot line only more
[1:10:55] Rivers he knows exactly what I'm talking
[1:10:57] about down south down there I know I
[1:11:00] know people don't hardly eat catfish up
[1:11:01] here but down south catfish is a
[1:11:04] delicacy them old big flatheads my grand
[1:11:08] my grandpa throwed you out of the boat
[1:11:09] for throwing one of them back
[1:11:12] Troy back in the late 70s and early 80s
[1:11:15] he was getting 250 Cent $2.50 a pound
[1:11:17] for live weight on them things and
[1:11:20] that's when people in Arkansas my
[1:11:21] goodness what they making $3 an hour so
[1:11:25] I mean that you know one of them 30 lb
[1:11:27] Flathead my goodness so we didn't get to
[1:11:29] eat Flathead it's moral the
[1:11:34] story we we ate we we ate the
[1:11:39] Buffalo we ate junk
[1:11:42] fish well they had rib bones and then
[1:11:45] you had them other fets in the back and
[1:11:48] they got they real bony like a drum or
[1:11:50] something you just bones like crazy
[1:11:51] little old bitty fine bones mom never
[1:11:54] would her let us eat them
[1:11:56] but after we got a little bit older
[1:11:58] she'd take that she take that fish and
[1:12:00] she'd break it up and she'd go through
[1:12:03] it and she'd pick out all them bones she
[1:12:06] just hadn't she just had a way that you
[1:12:07] break it if you broke it right they all
[1:12:09] come out right the same place and take
[1:12:11] all them bones and she'd just clean All
[1:12:12] Them Bones out and then she'd just give
[1:12:14] it to
[1:12:15] us and all we had to do is eat
[1:12:18] it we didn't had to figure out how to
[1:12:20] get the bone out of it all we had to do
[1:12:23] is eat it
[1:12:25] when God give you this
[1:12:27] message he took the bones
[1:12:30] out see he he divided it so that you
[1:12:34] could just consume it because it's
[1:12:36] already been divided for the church
[1:12:39] it this is the rightly divided
[1:12:45] truth God's gave it to you this morning
[1:12:48] I want to say we we we appreciate the
[1:12:50] holy spirit this morning and I pray this
[1:12:53] is speaking to somebody I
[1:12:56] I I I can't I can't help it I when I
[1:12:58] wake up the Holy Spirit speaks something
[1:12:59] to me I've learned I can I can either
[1:13:01] squelch that or I can just let the Lord
[1:13:04] speak and that's what we want to do this
[1:13:06] morning we want to just let him maybe
[1:13:07] this is speaking to your need this
[1:13:09] morning something you ever you ever
[1:13:11] wrestle with a scripture you ever

[1:13:15] wrestle with that truth don't wrestle
[1:13:17] with it this morning just receive
[1:13:20] it so brother way I'm having a hard time
[1:13:22] receiving it but if you got that Holy
[1:13:23] Ghost In You
[1:13:25] that nature will receive that word it'll
[1:13:29] overcome it that old that old outward
[1:13:32] man he might fuss with it a bit but it
[1:13:34] won't be long and that inner man will
[1:13:37] rise
[1:13:38] up he said you know that word's
[1:13:41] right it's about time for you to say

[1:13:46] repent then the Holy Spirit begin to
[1:13:48] move on you I tell you this morning
[1:13:51] friends I thank God for the truth
[1:13:55] I do I I don't
[1:13:59] know I I don't know if we have it in our
[1:14:03] capacity
[1:14:04] to show you the measure of what it means
[1:14:07] to be in possession of
[1:14:10] truth if you if you could just lift out
[1:14:12] for a moment and just take a view of the
[1:14:15] world there's little mamas this morning
