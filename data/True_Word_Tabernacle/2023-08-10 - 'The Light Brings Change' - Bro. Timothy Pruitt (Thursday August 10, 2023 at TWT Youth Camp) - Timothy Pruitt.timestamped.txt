[25:28] amen God bless you and welcome I hope
[25:30] you have a wonderful experience the last

[25:39] and for your support this weekend uh we
[25:42] have a we have a wonderful team here of
[25:43] staff I just want to take the time to
[25:45] introduce three of them that everybody
[25:48] needs to be aware of
[25:49] that's coming in first of all Brother
[25:51] Richard listen for the Amen in the back
[25:55] Brother Richard is in charge of
[25:57] registration and check-in so if you have
[25:59] got here in the middle of service or
[26:01] you're late if you don't know where
[26:03] you're sleeping or if you have not paid
[26:04] you need to go see brother Richard and
[26:07] then uh sister Lily Bontrager Dr Lilly
[26:11] she stepped out okay so um
[26:14] I guess if uh if there's a medical
[26:16] emergency find Brother Richard Brother
[26:18] Richard will find sister Lily and then
[26:20] uh
[26:21] and then in this corner we have uncle
[26:23] Ronnie
[26:32] and so if uh
[26:34] if you need something or you have a
[26:36] question between me and Ronnie we'll get
[26:37] it figured out so the Bible says call no
[26:40] man father but maybe uncle is okay
[26:43] amen
[26:45] so we just so we welcome you means a lot
[26:47] to have you uh I didn't I didn't do an
[26:50] exact count but we have well over 40
[26:52] possibly 50 churches that are
[26:54] represented here
[26:55] and so we just uh that's that's a very
[26:58] special thing for brothers and sisters
[27:00] to come together in unity but you know
[27:02] there's a difference between Unity of
[27:04] fellowship and unity of Faith but God
[27:07] has sent us a message a word in this day
[27:09] to bring us into the unity of the faith
[27:13] to the Perfection of the body and so
[27:15] what we really want is not just to bring
[27:17] people together but to get together and
[27:20] get in tune with the Holy Spirit this
[27:21] weekend and let the Lord have his way
[27:24] amen amen how many believe there's a
[27:26] time and a place for everything the
[27:28] Bible says there's a season there's a
[27:29] time there's there are certain times
[27:31] that are dedicated to a certain kind of
[27:33] experiences certain kind of feelings you
[27:35] know us there are certain types of
[27:37] church services
[27:38] you know we have uh we have meetings at
[27:41] our home church not every midweek
[27:42] Service is like the services that we
[27:43] have here at camp
[27:45] and uh some of them are but uh but what
[27:49] I want to say to you tonight just to set
[27:51] a little direction for the weekend is
[27:53] that this is camp meeting
[27:55] this is camp meeting
[27:58] and so you know there's a time and a
[27:59] place for everything uh sometimes you
[28:02] know we have we have services like we do

[28:08] you know everything's real balanced out
[28:10] and and that all the right quotes are
[28:12] read and things but you know there's a
[28:13] time to talk about measuring lines and
[28:16] we we believe those quotes and we teach
[28:17] them in our church there's a time to
[28:19] talk about Still Waters
[28:21] We Believe those quotes and we teach
[28:22] them in our church but this is camp

[1:03:52] 1
[1:03:54] amen also Matthew chapter four I just
[1:03:57] like to say it's an honor to be here
[1:03:59] amen a little bit different format this
[1:04:01] year but we're honored to have our
[1:04:03] brother Ron Spencer with us this weekend
[1:04:06] and brother Andrew of course
[1:04:09] and I think brother Wayne and brother
[1:04:11] Ray different ones brother Nathan for
[1:04:14] the invitation to come and be here
[1:04:16] something we don't take lightly to be
[1:04:18] standing here but we know it's a great
[1:04:20] place of responsibility but it's good to
[1:04:24] be standing before the cream of the crop
[1:04:25] and amen amen I believe our young people
[1:04:28] are the cream of the crop I don't think
[1:04:31] you can go anywhere and find a better
[1:04:33] group of young people than the young
[1:04:35] people around this message
[1:04:37] amen and we know it's because of the
[1:04:40] grace of God in our lives and we're
[1:04:41] thankful for that Grace we bring you

[1:04:49] this let's just have a wonderful weekend
[1:04:50] in the Lord amen how many come to get
[1:04:53] something from God how many come
[1:04:55] expecting to get something from God well
[1:04:58] then you're going to leave with what you
[1:04:59] expected amen so I hope you come with
[1:05:02] your your buckets and your everything
[1:05:04] you can get to just get all you can get
[1:05:06] I believe we ought to be some stingy
[1:05:09] people when it comes to getting
[1:05:10] something from God I want it all amen I
[1:05:13] want everything that God has for me and
[1:05:15] and uh amen God bless you today Genesis
[1:05:18] 1 Amen in verse 14 and God said let
[1:05:22] there be lights in the firmament of the
[1:05:24] heaven to divide the day from the night
[1:05:27] and let them be for signs and for
[1:05:28] seasons and for days and for years and
[1:05:32] let them be for lights in the firmament
[1:05:34] of the heaven to give light upon the
[1:05:36] Earth and it was so Matthew chapter 4
[1:05:39] and verse 16.
[1:05:41] says the people which sat in darkness
[1:05:44] saw great light
[1:05:46] and to them which sat in the region and
[1:05:48] shadow of death light is sprung up and
[1:05:52] from that time Jesus began to preach and
[1:05:54] say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:05:57] at ham
[1:05:58] amen we'll let you be seated today
[1:06:03] amen I
[1:06:06] last year I spoke on light and this year
[1:06:08] I'm going to speak on light I've been
[1:06:09] speaking on light for some time and but
[1:06:11] God is light it's kind of inexhaustible
[1:06:14] subject because that's who God is he's
[1:06:17] God is Lighting in him there's no
[1:06:19] Darkness at all
[1:06:20] amen but I like to just start this
[1:06:23] meeting out on LA on the light brings
[1:06:25] change
[1:06:27] amen I I believe that today as we read
[1:06:30] here
[1:06:31] um in our scripture about light and we
[1:06:33] could go back toward to the first verse
[1:06:36] of Genesis chapter one it says in the
[1:06:39] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:06:42] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:06:45] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:06:48] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:06:50] upon the face of the waters and God said
[1:06:53] let there be light and there was light
[1:06:56] so we find the Earth was without form in
[1:06:59] other words it was considered something
[1:07:01] of no value it was a place of waste a
[1:07:04] Barren place it was a place of Darkness
[1:07:07] this void means it was an empty space
[1:07:10] needed needing to be filled but God
[1:07:13] didn't leave it in the condition that he
[1:07:15] found it amen but he began to begin to
[1:07:18] speak his word and as he spoke his word
[1:07:20] the spirit of God began to move and it
[1:07:23] began to bring his word to pass and and
[1:07:25] you know because God didn't want to
[1:07:27] leaving in that condition God desired to
[1:07:29] create a need and he desired a man for
[1:07:32] there to be more upon the Earth and just
[1:07:34] a void or an emptiness but he wanted to
[1:07:36] guard in there and so he had seeds that
[1:07:38] were laying there in that Earth and he
[1:07:40] wanted them to come to life and so in
[1:07:43] order to bring this change upon the
[1:07:45] Earth he had to create light and light
[1:07:47] began to shine and change and it began
[1:07:50] to change the look it began to change
[1:07:52] the feel it began to change the
[1:07:54] landscape of the Earth because when
[1:07:57] light comes it changes things amen when
[1:08:00] light begins to Dawn and begins to move
[1:08:03] it changes things and and I just want to
[1:08:05] go through the scriptures here tonight
[1:08:06] about the change that light has made and
[1:08:08] I'm not of course going to hit every one
[1:08:10] of them but God has always used light to
[1:08:13] Mark a change amen you know in the in
[1:08:17] the burning bush came down there was a
[1:08:19] prophet that had been told he was a
[1:08:21] prophet all of his life and and he had
[1:08:23] he had he had been born a prophet he
[1:08:25] would been told he was a prophet often
[1:08:27] but you know we tried on his own to to
[1:08:29] do some things but on his own he just
[1:08:32] was able to kill two Egyptians and so he
[1:08:34] finds himself out on the backside of a
[1:08:36] desert and he's out there for years and
[1:08:38] seemed like the promises is long
[1:08:40] forgotten and his long past and it's
[1:08:43] over but one morning the prophet of God
[1:08:45] said he got up and it began to walk down
[1:08:47] this path that the Sheep would walking
[1:08:49] down and hit as he's walking down that
[1:08:51] path he began to see something over
[1:08:53] there on the side of the Hill there was
[1:08:55] a bush that was on fire but it didn't
[1:08:58] burn and he said God began to pull him
[1:09:01] to that place because God wanted to make
[1:09:04] a change amen here he had tried on his
[1:09:07] own many times and he had done all that
[1:09:09] he had could but he had all he could do
[1:09:11] is produce two dead Egyptians but God
[1:09:13] wanted to come and show him who he was
[1:09:15] really was and what he had called him to
[1:09:17] be and he brought him to this place and
[1:09:20] he brings him to this life and he said
[1:09:22] as he was thinking on his way there
[1:09:23] began to be a crackling on the side of
[1:09:26] the Hill that caught him his still
[1:09:27] caught his attention and he moved and
[1:09:29] when he did he went to that place and a
[1:09:32] voice spoke out and he said Moses take
[1:09:34] off your shoes because you're on Holy
[1:09:36] Ground and that voice began to reveal to
[1:09:38] him who he really was and that light
[1:09:41] began to change him and it changed him
[1:09:44] so much that he would leave that place
[1:09:46] and and he would go down and gather his
[1:09:48] wife and his children and his his donkey
[1:09:50] and his rod and he would go down to
[1:09:52] Egypt and brother Randall said it was
[1:09:54] quite a paradox because here but here
[1:09:56] comes a man going down to the greatest
[1:09:58] army that it was ever on the face of the
[1:10:00] Earth at that time and you would ask him
[1:10:03] where are you going Moses and some going
[1:10:04] down to Egypt to take over and something
[1:10:07] had changed him he was backside of the
[1:10:10] desert scared and out of the will of God
[1:10:13] but amen the light of God came down and
[1:10:16] it changed his life so much and it gave
[1:10:19] him a message that he believed and he
[1:10:21] began to go and he said I'm going to go
[1:10:23] tell Pharaoh let my children go and that
[1:10:26] light came down down to produce a change
[1:10:28] amen and it began it made such a change
[1:10:31] in his life that he went to pharaoh and
[1:10:33] he spoke to pharaoh and he said I got a
[1:10:35] message for you and God spoke to me let
[1:10:38] my children go and and you know Pharaoh
[1:10:40] hardened his heart and we know all the
[1:10:41] story of the ten plagues but amen there
[1:10:44] came a time that they left out of there
[1:10:46] the scripture says with a high hand and
[1:10:48] they're on their way down and they're on
[1:10:50] their way to Victory seems like and
[1:10:52] they're again there's a shout and
[1:10:54] there's a voice of Triumph and there's
[1:10:55] singing and dancing but all of a sudden
[1:10:57] there's a Red Sea in their way and
[1:11:00] they're wondering well God did you bring
[1:11:01] us out here just to die you know did you
[1:11:04] bring us out here just to drown was
[1:11:05] there no graves in Egypt was there no
[1:11:08] place somewhere else we could be buried

[1:21:45] Mary was on the road to the well
[1:21:49] thinking on some things

[1:21:58] weekend took a bus or a van
[1:22:01] on their way down to a well
[1:22:04] thinking on things and thinking about
[1:22:06] scriptures and brother Brown said all of
[1:22:08] a sudden a light began to flash in front
[1:22:10] of her
[1:22:11] and out of this light so that light
[1:22:13] began to whirl and it got bigger and it
[1:22:16] got bigger and he said all of a sudden
[1:22:17] now that light stepped an angel
[1:22:19] I wonder how he knew that because he
[1:22:21] experienced that
[1:22:22] he knew exactly what took place and now
[1:22:25] this light steps an angel he said I
[1:22:27] wonder how little Mary felt did you ever

[1:23:36] in her arms all them women keeping her
[1:23:38] distance neither all them moving away

[1:23:52] just swaddling cloth in the manger they

[1:24:11] that's Among Us
[1:24:14] what they failed to see was the light
[1:24:16] that visited Mary
[1:24:19] they wanted to call an illegitimate
[1:24:22] child and say it was of the devil
[1:24:26] come on somebody

[1:24:30] call this move of God but they they

[1:26:28] they're still doing the same thing they
[1:26:30] call him now a Holy Roller
[1:26:34] a fanatic
[1:26:35] but Mary knew whose baby that was
[1:26:42] Hallelujah Mary knew she didn't receive
[1:26:46] this from a man she knew she didn't
[1:26:48] receive this from from just a mortal
[1:26:51] human being no she had received this
[1:26:53] from the Holy Ghost something that moved
[1:26:56] inside of her and meant again that it
[1:26:58] was a miracle that took place
[1:27:00] [Applause]
[1:27:03] Miracle until you become a miracle
[1:27:07] you will never understand the
[1:27:09] supernatural until you become the
[1:27:11] supernatural you will never understand
[1:27:13] the things of God until you become a
[1:27:16] thing of God until God comes and changes
[1:27:19] your life
[1:27:20] [Applause]
[1:27:26] Hallelujah
[1:27:31] on the day of Pentecost there was a
[1:27:34] light that showed up
[1:27:36] when the Holy Ghost had come
[1:27:40] direct quote
[1:27:43] the Bible says that any Prophet said it
[1:27:48] Isaiah says precept must be upon precept
[1:27:51] lying upon line here a little there a
[1:27:53] little hold fast to what is good for the
[1:27:55] stammered lips
[1:27:56] and with other tongues well I speak to
[1:27:58] the it's amazing message preacher don't
[1:28:00] quote that very much
[1:28:04] stammering lips and other tongues while
[1:28:06] I speak to those people and this is the
[1:28:07] rest this is the Sabbath that I'll give
[1:28:09] to you in all this they were not here
[1:28:14] they walked away wagging their heads
[1:28:17] this is the prophet of God isn't it they
[1:28:20] walked away wagged their head whacking
[1:28:22] their heads and went on the day of
[1:28:24] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:28:26] those people they acted like drunk men
[1:28:28] and women
[1:28:31] under the impact of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:33] walked out and wagged their heads and
[1:28:36] said these people are drunk
[1:28:38] they're full of new wine
[1:28:40] but it was absolutely the light
[1:28:44] the word that had been prophesied was
[1:28:47] now made manifest
[1:28:50] [Applause]
[1:28:55] did you read where also he said God
[1:28:57] doesn't change his pattern
[1:29:03] this is the first surface don't worry
[1:29:08] light changes things
[1:29:13] you know it was Georgia Carter one time
[1:29:16] had found herself in a really bad place
[1:29:19] on a bed
[1:29:21] for a year what a seven eight nine years
[1:29:24] what was it nine years
[1:29:26] to where she'd rub the post almost the
[1:29:29] paint off of them
[1:29:32] brother Branham sees a vision or I can't
[1:29:35] remember dream vision of a lamb that was
[1:29:37] caught in a Thicket
[1:29:40] and he hears this bye bye
[1:29:47] Middletown
[1:29:49] what had happened she had got a pamphlet
[1:29:52] of something
[1:29:53] of another girl that had been healed
[1:29:55] and she said if God could heal that girl
[1:29:57] God can heal me
[1:30:00] and she began to cry out now she was in
[1:30:03] a family that did not believe they
[1:30:05] didn't believe in that God they didn't
[1:30:06] believe God there was in a church and
[1:30:08] didn't believe
[1:30:11] yeah we we sometimes find ourselves in
[1:30:13] those places families that don't believe
[1:30:15] churches that don't believe but that
[1:30:17] don't mean God doesn't do what his word
[1:30:19] said he would do
[1:30:21] he just looking for a heart that will
[1:30:24] believe no matter how bad the situation
[1:30:26] is no matter how bad it's been
[1:30:29] do you believe
[1:30:36] and he goes to asking around where's

[1:32:35] Satan poking you and saying get up and
[1:32:37] go to the bathroom talk to your neighbor
[1:32:39] do this and he's trying to distract you
[1:32:41] meanwhile the light starts whirling
[1:32:47] all of a sudden he said I saw a light
[1:32:50] whirling and out of that light spoke a
[1:32:52] voice and said go by the way of Carters
[1:33:00] Dave
[1:33:01] and hear this girl

[1:33:41] speak and says Rise Up In The Name of
[1:33:42] Jesus he said I didn't know how it could
[1:33:44] happen
[1:33:45] he said I just know what the voice said
[1:33:48] and that little old bony girl got up

[1:49:41] except the father showed me for the
[1:49:44] father loves the son it shows him what
[1:49:46] he does shows him all the things that
[1:49:49] he'd do with and he will show you
[1:49:50] greater things than the healing this
[1:49:52] diabetic or tubercular or whatever it is
[1:49:54] that you may Marvel but I can do nothing
[1:49:56] except the father show me
[1:50:00] and they said well what about all those
[1:50:02] lame halt blind Twisted withered waiting
[1:50:04] over there the father had showed him
[1:50:06] nothing about it so he went right on he
[1:50:09] said what the father showed him to do he
[1:50:11] did
[1:50:13] but according to his words who is the
[1:50:15] Son of God he could do nothing unto the
[1:50:17] first the father showed him he said no
[1:50:19] more I can't heal no one
[1:50:21] he said this I do say when I was baby
[1:50:24] born up in the state of Kentucky
[1:50:25] according to my dear mother which has
[1:50:27] been Vindicated through my life I said
[1:50:29] it said there was a light to come into
[1:50:31] the room that little bundle huddled
[1:50:33] there over my little crib and he said
[1:50:35] come right there about five o'clock in
[1:50:37] the morning a light circled just at the
[1:50:39] breaking of the day
[1:50:41] and I said since that time that light
[1:50:43] has been with me
[1:50:45] it's an angel of God he met me in person
[1:50:48] a few years ago down through my life
[1:50:49] he's told me many things that's happened
[1:50:51] and I told them just as he told me and I
[1:50:54] challenge anybody at any place to go to
[1:50:57] any City where I was raised or anywhere
[1:51:00] else that a statement's ever been made
[1:51:02] in the name of the Lord what it came to
[1:51:04] pass exactly how it was said it would
[1:51:10] but you know how the devil is he waits
[1:51:13] to the Witnesses are gone
[1:51:18] yeah
[1:51:21] these people that wants to come out
[1:51:22] about this stuff nowadays I just want to
[1:51:24] ask them were you there
[1:51:27] yes or no
[1:51:29] no I don't want to hear what you got to
[1:51:32] say
[1:51:41] amen
[1:51:44] he said anyway anyone here any Christian
[1:51:47] knows that God will have nothing to do
[1:51:49] with error
[1:51:51] so what he said about laodicea and he
[1:51:54] said I'm the faithful and true Witness
[1:51:56] the amen of God Amen he will not bless
[1:52:00] an error it has been and had been gone
[1:52:02] found out before this time it would
[1:52:03] never do God will not bless the heir but
[1:52:05] if I Testify the truth then God will
[1:52:08] testify of me if I make a statement and
[1:52:11] God has told me to do so then God will
[1:52:13] back it up do you believe that if he
[1:52:15] doesn't back it up then he never said it
[1:52:19] but if he made the statement God will
[1:52:21] stand behind what he promised
[1:52:24] he said oh you don't know how that makes
[1:52:26] me feel don't think I'm just off of my
[1:52:29] sense of balance I know where I'm at am
[1:52:31] look yes I know where I am I know what
[1:52:33] I'm talking about and every born-again
[1:52:36] man or woman knows what they're talking
[1:52:39] about
[1:52:42] it's whether you can appropriate the
[1:52:44] faith I don't know but what God says is
[1:52:47] the truth and I said if I tell the truth
[1:52:49] God will testify God is under obligation
[1:52:52] to testify he will not have nothing to
[1:52:55] do with air so if I have told the truth
[1:52:58] God will testify the truth and about
[1:53:01] that time
[1:53:04] here comes down across where I was it
[1:53:08] excited this photographer he ran up one
[1:53:10] that got the glossy glossy of the man he
[1:53:13] snapped a picture of me standing there
[1:53:15] and I said God will testify and I will

[1:58:14] light has come to produce a change
[1:58:23] I was thinking about this morning or
[1:58:25] this evening over in the cabin I was
[1:58:27] thinking about over there in the valley
[1:58:28] of agilon
[1:58:31] I rode to that Valley about the time the
[1:58:34] sun was going down
[1:58:38] Joshua was fighting you know there was
[1:58:40] five Kings to come against him
[1:58:42] remember the story I got to reading
[1:58:44] about that that one king ain't got his
[1:58:46] name but the historians looking at it as
[1:58:50] Melchizedek the king of righteousness
[1:58:52] and this other's real close he got a
[1:58:54] name real close to Melchizedek and he
[1:58:56] calls himself the son of righteousness
[1:58:57] ain't that something
[1:59:00] the devil's always trying to copy cat
[1:59:03] come right in the same place
[1:59:08] and he's daring Joshua to take his
[1:59:10] position
[1:59:12] the same place Melchizedek and met
[1:59:15] Abraham Joshua was coming back to it and
[1:59:18] the devil's standing there just denying
[1:59:20] him and saying you can't take this land
[1:59:21] you can't be this you can't and he
[1:59:24] gathers his forces together and he gets
[1:59:25] in four of the Kings to go fight
[1:59:29] it didn't go quite as planned
[1:59:33] devil this weekend is not going to go
[1:59:35] quiet as planned
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:44] this weekend is not going to go quite as
[1:59:47] planned
[1:59:49] he began to gather his forces and he
[1:59:51] began to come against Joshua and the
[1:59:53] Bible says they begin to whoop their
[1:59:55] hides all over their Promised Land
[1:59:58] whoop them all day long until the sun
[2:00:01] started going down and Joshua said Son
[2:00:04] you stand there and moon you stand there
[2:00:08] what was it Joshua wasn't afraid to
[2:00:10] fight in the night he'd already fought
[2:00:12] him the night before he just wanted
[2:00:13] enough light to finish the war
[2:00:16] he wanted just enough life to take that
[2:00:18] devil's head off I'm done with you devil
[2:00:21] I'm done with you and this is the Finish
[2:00:26] haha

[2:00:40] of Christ and the Son of God is in this
[2:00:42] building tonight and we're going to

[2:00:49] under our feet
[2:00:52] hallelujah we're going to stand in our
[2:00:54] positions until young people put their
[2:00:57] foot on the neck of that devil

[2:01:11] that depression and that pornography and
[2:01:14] those kind of sicknesses of every kind
[2:01:16] there's somebody
[2:01:20] Joshua said we need a little more time
[2:01:22] and they said hey there's five Kings up
[2:01:24] there they don't hid themselves he said
[2:01:26] go ahead and throw some stones on them

[2:01:29] [Applause]
[2:01:32] till we can't chase them no more
[2:01:35] and the Bible said they ran them all the
[2:01:38] way back to their wall cities and Joshua
