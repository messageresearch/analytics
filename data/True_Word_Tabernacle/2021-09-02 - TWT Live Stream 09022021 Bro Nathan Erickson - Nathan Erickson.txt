tonight amen feed me lord from your word god bless you saints good to be together once again amen how many are happy in the lord tonight praise the lord we've had a wonderful couple weeks amen and uh my heart just feels has just been full lately i don't know about you with the goodness of the lord amen with the things that he's doing in our midst god is so good amen we just want to remain in the channel tonight amen just a little simple thought in my heart tonight we'll just go directly to the word and let the lord have his way amen isaiah the 32nd chapter we'll just take the first two verses there and then we'll also take a verse out of proverbs 18. amen well i know we're missing a lot of the saints tonight how many are going to help me out tonight amen thank you i need it amen isaiah chapter 32 and the verse first two verses there the word says behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert or shelter from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land proverbs 18 and i think these words really resonate to the day that we're living in amen we are people in need of a shelter proverbs 18 and the 10th verse the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous runeth into it and is safe and it's safe of course brother branham used these scriptures to preach letting off the pressure i've been studying those messages letting off the pressure as well i've been studying all three of the hidden life in christ sermons of brother branham preached and my title tonight is are you alive in there are you alive in there a question for us tonight let's just have a word of prayer heavenly father lord you look down upon us tonight father and see our inadequacy lord father just the just the hopelessness lord of human flesh lord to to make a refuge in this weary land lord for your people but oh god i thank you lord that you've given us a word father and you've given us a leadership lord and and lord although we don't maybe know always how to navigate our way through this world lord yet you know where the green pastures are father and you've been the shepherd of our lives father and given us a word lord that's able to lead us into the place father that we need to come where we can find safety father where we can find something that will satisfy our thirst oh god i pray lord that just in this moment for these few minutes lord as we labor to bring forth your word lord may your anointing come amongst this father may your spirit be free to move oh god that you may usher us into that place lord that we could join lord not just uh brother to brother sister to sister father but may we be joined with you in fellowship lord in that holy of holies father may we press beyond the crowd father and even in the lack of lord our our full numbers here tonight may we be shut in with god i pray and have a personal encounter lord with your presence that's our desire and that's our very dire need lord is for more of you father so lord as we just saying lord making a gesture of an uplifted hand father here's my cup lord and these people are raising their vessels to you father asking that you would fill us once again lord with your anointing with your spirit lord with your and pour your glories out once again in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you they're seated tonight are you alive in there are you alive in there and just bear with me for a little bit uh uh just i want to i just want to share some things from my heart just to lay a foundation i just don't know quite how how uh how it's how it's meant to be put together but i'm just trusting in the lord tonight for the leadership amen thank you buddy amen but brother branham spoke preached the message of course letting off the pressure and it was a very relevant message for the time it was one of the last uh it was one of the the the in the last years of his ministry he was preaching this in the 1960s about a age of such a pressure in such a hurry and it's such a uh it's such a load and a burden that people are carrying and stress upon people and and people's minds failing and all the things that are prophetic of the age that we're living in and and of course i think that we could claim to say that we've seen an increase in those things that pressure has not gotten less it's gotten more there's more of a pressure today there's more of a load on the people of god and and and brother branham said uh had a quote there that i thought was quite powerful he said there's a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation it has no limitation it has no denominational lines it's on everybody christian sinner uh no matter the person if you're a human being and you're living in this age you're under pressure it also he said it has no age line it has no respecter of persons it's on young and old it's on good and bad it's on everybody there's a pressure amen and brother branham is preaching these things to to to bring us to a recognition that we're living in satan's eden we're living in a world that's falling apart this this world is not a it's not a whole world or a healthy world or a or or or even a good world it's satan's eden and i think the the key takeaway from uh from that message of satan's eden that the the takeaway from these things is that we you and i need to realize that this world that we're living in was not built for us it was not built for you was not built for me or for my good or for my peace or for my joy it was built for satan for amen for the worship of satan amen for the pride of satan and the arrogance of satan that's what this this society that we're living in is satan's eat and it was not made with you in mind amen all of the pressures of this life this rat race that we're that we're going after and that's why people are miserable in their jobs and miserable in their work because they find no meaning in it they find that it's not contributing anything to the world it's not bringing any more goodness into the world but it's just feeding this great machine amen which is going away from god it's going away from from peace away from joy it's getting worse and worse and worse all the time amen and so this life that we're trying to live is not a life that was meant for us amen and i think there's actually a refuge in that for a christian because a lot of the troubles that we go through as christian especially as young people is we're trying to find in our life a way that we to make our christian life and and the life of of a christian boy or christian girl and trying to make that fit somehow with this world it will never fit amen because the world was not made for christians it was not made for the sons and daughters of god it was made for the devil amen it'll perish with the devil amen but oh my amen but there is a refuge you see it it's just such a deceitful world all of the measures of success of wealth and power and popularity and and all those things that that this world measures success by amen they hold no satisfaction the things that we truly desire even as human beings even biologically speaking those needs are not met by the successes of this world amen uh the way that society is run our our anti-social media is making relationships worse than it's ever been amen amen i i could say that as a technological statement amen that that social media and and the way that that that that society is conducted online today it was not engineered it was not created in a way to make meaningful relationships but that's not just a that's not just a technological statement it's a scriptural statement because the bible said the love of many shall wax cold amen that families would fall apart friendships would fall apart that people would become distant they would become cold that the love and fellowship in people's heart would begin to diminish amen and what a pressure it's bringing on people hey man but because of because of the way that we're meant to project our lives and on social medias and things then then it poisons all our affection with jealousies and and competition and well my life's better than you and i've got more of this or more of that and more to show off and and and all of it friends is putting a pressure on the people it's putting a great pressure it's poisoning everything amen amen we run to entertainments and things and and and and the majority of people in this world and in this society are addicted to entertainment because that's what it serves for entertainment is a drug young people and the purpose of entertainment amen is to dull your senses until you'll become satisfied with a lesser life and a lesser existence and the misery of a layout of seeing life amen not everything not all the devil's traps are to destroy you some of them are to make you settle for less amen for a lesser life for less peace less joy amen but just a little bit of an entertainment you can shoot in amen and and and get a little bit of enough of a buzz to get you through the night to get you to fall asleep amen to get you to go through that same cycle the next day amen all of it does is dulls the pain of a life without purpose without meaning that's why people are more miserable than they've ever been amen they're chasing after fashions and fads amen and things of this world amen and and that's and fashion makes a promise it promises that if you conform to the fashions of this world then you will receive acceptance amen so you must chase after a fashion amen you must buy it you must dress a certain way you must watch a certain movie and you've got to be in on a certain joke or something and then you'll be accepted for a time and then it'll move on and you've got to chase it and chase it and chase it and amen until we become a society of consumption amen we consume and we consume and we just devour and devour and we spend and we spend and we're never allowed to stop and we never we never are able to purchase what our heart is longing for amen satisfaction never comes friends amen it's a it's satan's eden and so it's brought a pressure on the people until we have a society that has more wealth than it's ever had before it's more healthy than it ever has been before it's got more pleasures than we've ever had before more comforts like we ever had and on the inside people are dead dead on the inside but in christ is promised life life is in jesus christ life is in christ in this world is no shelter there's no home coming there's no satisfaction there's no rest but in christ he is a strong tower friends the bible says he's a shelter he is a refuge he is a place where you can run and you can find your rest when the world and the environments of the world are not giving you what you are needing there is a shelter amen if there's a thirst then there is a there is a brook amen in dry land hallelujah shelter in jesus christ excuse me for a moment now what does it mean for him to be a shelter for him to be your shelter means that the world you're on the inside and the world is on the outside if you're in a shelter if you truly if if you're in christ scripturally speaking then you're on the inside and the world is on the outside and christ becomes a barrier not only a barrier but actually a defense between you and the outside world amen and we were sharing with the young people there at the camp how we're living in a day when these cold layout of seeing winds are blowing it's a it's a cold age there's storms in this world amen and we could liken it to a to a great storm that's come and it's blowing cold winds over the whole earth and everyone everyone is becoming cold they're becoming lukewarm the love of many is waxing cold amen in these cold layouts seeing winds and what those winds are influences amen because it's an age of many voices it's a it's an age of many uniters and many causes and many many gatherers and and these winds these cold winds are blowing trying to bring an influence on the people amen trying to expose our young people to to some ideas or or to some lifestyle or or something of this world which will not ultimately satisfy them amen and we find that there that any any any you brothers that that you like to be you're an outdoorsman you know that when you get out uh if you're a survivalist and you get out in the wilderness one of the biggest dangers for you is exposure it would be to be out in this world with no control over the temperature no control over the wind or the weather or the rain and and so you're exposed amen and without a shelter then you could die to the exposure and i tell you there's only one way for our young people for our old ones there's only way in this age of influence in this age of a pressure the age where satan's agenda is being preached to us over every pulpit over every platform every second of every day amen there's only one way to survive the exposure and that's to get in this shelter amen when we see the world when we see these voices trying to unite the world as the scripture said there would be two unities in the in the end time there would be a uniting of the tares and the uniting of the seed amen and all these voices are trying to unite and brother bran said they'll even quote scripture trying to unite the people they said well jesus said we should all be one brother brahm said not that kind of one the kind of unity that you're looking for the shelter that you're needing amen is just like jesus said i and my father are one i'm in them and they are in me in this shelter shut in with god the world is shut out we're not part of this world we're not trying to fit in with this world we're not trying to find peace in this world but we are in christ brother braham said what a beautiful picture it is today hidden life in christ of a consecrated life once they enter into christ they're dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veil drops around and all the world shut off then christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer now this is quite powerful now check your life by this amen today people have just enough religion to make them miserable isn't that a true statement just enough religion to make them miserable knowing that they ought to do this but they're just trying to escape hell he said well if that's the way i felt about it brother i don't know what i would do to think about that just enough religion to make you miserable we got plenty of that kind of religion around this message brother sister amen that spirit is just as alive and messes churches as in any denomination amen just enough religion to dress the part to swap the quotes amen sing the songs quote the scriptures attend the meetings but brother branstad are we getting people to christ are we just getting them to the church amen well how will you know if you found christ or if you just found religion when you've got a hidden life with christ nobody else is in there with you but you're in that shelter amen it doesn't matter what the crowd does it doesn't matter what the church does doesn't matter what your friends are doing or the life that they're going after or the standards that they're holding you are shut in with christ and nobody exists in that place but you and god and you found a personal fellowship with christ it's just you and the shekinah glory and nobody else figures into it hallelujah that's what we need friends we need to get in there into that shelter oh my and then you'll be alive then you want to be dead inside like these miserable zombies of this world amen but you'll be alive in christ shut in with god in a shelter where the cold winds of laodicea can't touch you they can't destabilize you they can't hook you on satan's gospel you're shut in with god having therefore brethren boldness to enter into that holiest by the blood of jesus a new and living way through the veil through the veil that's where we got to get to we got to press through the veil and meet god and nothing else no other substitute will will suffice friends oh brother brahm said get in with christ shut off from the things of the world to commune with him is a pleasure to commune with him is a pleasure amen if you got just enough religion to make you miserable amen what the problem is we lose a lot of our young people we lose a lot of people out of the churches because they get just enough religion to make them miserable and then they decide for themselves that it'll be easier to believe that there's nothing more to it that everybody's just as miserable as they are and that that religion is just as bad for for everyone else as it is for them and everybody's playing a hypocrisy friends can i get a witness tonight of somebody who's been shutting with god amen and you know the pleasures amen the pleasures the the glories the joy a day in his presence is better than a thousand elsewhere hallelujah friends don't ever let the devil make you believe that this kind of a life is not available to every son and daughter of god there is a veil that as the way has been made the veil was torn to you and i could boldly enter in there into a life that goes beyond a lifestyle beyond a religion and you're living in there with christ and you're alive and your heart is alive and quickened and full of life brother branham said to commune with him as a pleasure it's beautiful it's something that fills and satisfies the soul something that gives you peace that passes all understanding all the crosses become flying wings all the burdens are chariot wheels oh you can fly away my burdens are light he said yoke up with him and the yoke is all padded with hallelujahs amen when you're inside the veil with him he becomes your life he becomes your life just like aaron's rod a dead branch when it goes in that presence it bears fruit it brings forth life amen and that's where our fruit comes from that's where the supernatural comes from that's where signs and wonders come from the fruits of the spirit come from a a believer who has gone beyond the church pressed through that veil and they're fellowshipping in there in the shekinah with god amen and the reason our churches aren't bearing fruit is because they're not dwelling in the mach in the shekinah amen now brother brahms spoke about the three courts of the temple and i i i'm gonna gloss over some of these things i know we're educated in these things but how the temple had three courts representing justification sanctification and then the baptism of the holy ghost takes you into the holy of holies right amen but but uh but in that there was an inner court brother braham said of sanctification and he said in that in that inner court they had light there is a light to sanctification sanctification would be let's call it churchianity i think that's a i think that word has a meaning to all of us but in in that in that in that court there's light but brother brown said it was an artificial light and this really struck me here he said in there they had a seven point lamp you know the candlesticks they're spoken of the scripture they had a seven-point lamp that would give them light but he said sometimes those lights got low sometimes they got smoked up amen sometimes see friends amen we know all about seven church ages i know we got people in our ranks that they can they can draw out all the diagrams they can explain the seven church ages they got their candlesticks all right they got all the everything everything's just right the only thing that's missing is amen something when it gets all smoked up that'll keep that fire burning amen because it's an artificial light it's a man-made light and so ultimately it will be extinguished amen and so that's where people get in the cycle of a christian life save one day and backslid in the next and one day your confession is you're a believer and the next day you're lost amen but in that cycle that's sanctification brother there's a deeper life in christ there's an inner court there's a holy of holies amen and so and in that holy of holies it becomes not what you know and now what you've been educated not the church that you belong to or the doctrines that you hold to be true amen but it's a it it's going from an artificial life to the shekinah light amen amen well we could talk about doctrines and we can talk about all the reformations of the church ages and and and and we could we can go through all the lights of those seven candlesticks and every single one of them is an artificial light amen living in the glare of a past ages amen living in the glare of doctrines and and and head knowledge and intellectual understandings amen you see you can fellowship in that inner court but you and and all your candlesticks arrange just writing all your diagrams drawn and quote all the quotes and be artificial but i believe god didn't send a prophet to educate us about seven church ages but i believe god sent a prophet to usher us into a bride age and what that means to me is to go beyond amen the artificial light of just being a quote-unquote message believer a quote quote message believer amen but you've gone past the veil and you've met the present jesus christ that this message is testifying of his presence this message came to forerun amen a restoration of the abiding presence of the shekinah glory the very zoe life of christ in you christ in you amen and it's real oh you think i'm content to live in a layout i see in existence friends i'm not trying to eke out a life in this world i'm trying to get in that little room amen i'm trying to get me i'm trying to get i i believe i'm part of that tent vision amen you know where i'm in abraham's tent waiting for this promised son i'm in that holy of holies beyond the veil and nobody can enter in there amen and drag me out because it's death tanner in there not the not satan himself can't drag me out because i'm shut in with god i've been called out of of an age of laodicea and i'm in a bright age amen in fellowship with my redeemer with my bridegroom oh friends brother said the man who entered in that veil fell behind him he didn't depend on the sunlight the starlight the moonlight or the seven golden candlesticks the shekinah glory of the lord was in there and he lived amen whether clouds were going on whether the rain was falling thunder rolling whether an army was coming it didn't mean a bit of difference to him he was protected he was in the shekinah glory living in the presence of god hallelujah brother branstad now he said you think i'm a holy roller maybe i am let me tell you something brother if it takes a call to a holy roller to live in the shekinah glory let me stay with god in the shekinah glory call it what you want to friends amen now we're getting into the burning of my heart for this message tonight i would rather be a whooping hollering fanatic to this world and know that i've got something real then have all of my candlesticks polished and all of my quotes right and all of my doctrines figured out and all of my constellations name and living artificial life i'm looking for a reality i don't mean shouting with the crowd i mean shut in with god where the glories of the lord are raining down that kind of a holy ghost amen that don't go out it don't get it's not extinguished it never goes stale a manna brother bran said no matter how much you shout or try to do if you haven't got a life that your neighbor knows you're a christian there's something wrong somewhere amen see we know these things but he said there's nobody in the world who believes in any old time of old times shouting and blessing and praising god then i do oh hallelujah brother man said i believe a baby that's born in it don't move it don't whimper it don't do nothing he said you know what a doctor does he picks that stillborn baby up and he said he gives it us good spanking amen until it gets to whining and crying to show that it's got some life into it friends i think in this lukewarm age it's all right to have a little fiery preaching amen that'll smack that spiritual deadness out of the people amen and bring a stillborn child to life amen then we would have less of this artificial laodicean so-called message believing that's just a bunch of quote quoting and no life to back it up no supernatural no signs and wonders no realities of his presence no pillar fire moving in the meetings friends give me a reality letting off the pressure that's why we need friends brother brown said when you get in that tower when you get in that holy place then you can let off some steam amen that's why we get a little noisy sometimes in the church of the living god amen it's because you've got people that are under such a pressure of this age amen but to get in the presence of god where that valve gets released friends we got a little steam to blow off we got a little pressure to let loose hallelujah amen it's because it's a refuge it's a release it's a rest it's oh it's a hiding place you can let off that steam let off that stress that pressure it's joy to worship god it's a joy amen to have a shout in the camp amen we had a little testimony that was really dear to my heart it really meant a lot to me one of the young men that came to the youth camp the guerrilla went back to his uh to his home church and he said in the in those meetings you know the young people were shouting and dancing and there was a lot of that going on amen which i thought was wonderful amen and uh and uh and so this young man testified and he made a confession he said i was sitting there i was a critic and i liked the way that he explained how it was he said i was watching this one i'm watching that one i was saying is that right is that right is that right and i like the phrase that used for it he said i was micromanaging god until god couldn't move unless i was controlling it god couldn't do anything for somebody unless i was involved and keep a damper on the situation friends amen amen he said you know he said he was dealing with that amen trying to control how everyone else was being affected but he said you know it was wonderful how brother timothy there on sunday morning spoke something to him he said it spoke directly to his heart through the preaching of the word and loosed him for that and he said the next thing i knew i was out there dancing with them glory to god friends amen when you've gone past the veil it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks it doesn't matter what anybody else is doing nobody else is in there with you that's how you know if you've got a critical spirit if you're really shut in with god if you're shutting with god you're not watching everybody else and you're not thinking about what everyone else thanks to you it's you and god in a reality of a fellowship and then you can get a little excited and you don't have to worry you don't have to think about it friends glory be to god they can criticize or not criticize they can shout or not shout they can dance or not dance they don't make any difference to the believer because he's he's in there oh are you alive in there are you alive in there friends when we come to when we come to church and we hear the preaching of the word and god begins to move amongst his people people begin excited people's lives are being touched amen are you alive in that presence or are you sitting out in that outer court watching everybody else sitting there in your sanctified self-righteous religion and looking at everybody else you're not supposed to be in that court you're not supposed to be out there in the public you're supposed to be shut in with god hallelujah amen when that lame man brother josh was preaching about was leaping and dancing and whooping and hollering and carrying on at the gate beautiful amen anybody passing by might have looked at him and thought well he just get a little emotional he's just got in his flesh a little bit friends they would have thought that if they hadn't seen him the day before but anybody who saw him the day before they would understand why uh a man that was lame could leap and shout and dance for joy friend if you don't understand why i get a little noisy to worship my god you might have been there amen when he lifted me out of where i was in amen you weren't there amen when he took me out of a fake religion and brought me into that holy of holies you don't know about it oh but you could find out hallelujah amen back in that old tabernacle outside of that tabernacle the man would fall oh yeah they'd have camp meetings they'd have outpourings they'd have movings and dancings and rejoicings and they had experiences they had manna amen well after a while that man would go stale brother brown said that's some trouble he actually talked about camp meetings he said that's trouble with can with people they just get a camp meeting experience and they didn't get past the veil right but but friends he didn't throw out the camp meeting all right amen but you see because the outside that manna was always falling the blessings were being poured out but on the inside in that holy of holies there was a golden pot and the manna in there never went stale it never went bad over the centuries friends that that that that experience that manna brother brand said that's the holy ghost he said in that holy ghost that's in there in a in a hidden life in christ he said it never goes oh it never runs out it's just as fresh every day oh friends brother bram said and we don't have brother bran said we don't have to get some kind of emotional or mental makeup he said we can get not only a mouthful but we can get a soulful of the original baptism of the holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost and it'll bring the same results as it did on the day of pentecost see some some people's shout doesn't hold but that doesn't mean it wasn't manna friends i i really want so i really want you to get this tonight it was manna it strengthened them for the season now if it didn't hold out that don't mean it wasn't a real blessing from the lord the thing about it is let that strengthen you to get in where the man is always fresh oh gloria you see this means a lot to me because this is a personal experience friends you say well some of those young people they were just caught up in emotion they were just saw well what in the world is wrong with that friends i would rather our young people get caught up in the joy of the lord than be caught up in depression or caught up in drugs or caught up in this miserable old world let him escape for a moment you see i'm a young person i shouted in a lot of services before i got the holy ghost but i'm so glad for the manna that got me to the ark i'm so glad that i didn't go home thinking well there's nothing to these to these services there's nothing to this holy ghost amen oh i'm so glad i didn't find a cold formal fake religion but it's a real holy ghost and if you ever get that really dwelling on the inside of you not just the outpouring of a one service but living on the inside and christ is living in you and you're living in christ friends that'll be fresh amen amen but it's the holy ghost it's the manna i wouldn't speak a bit i wouldn't speak against it what we have is a bunch of half-star theologians trying to explain away the movie they haven't eaten manna in so long until they can't hardly move amen until they can't hardly function until they're just about dead on the inside about to be dead on the outside trying to explain away the moving of the holy ghost that smells like garlic to me amen to leave this outpouring of to leave the bride's revival and go back to some baptist or methodist methodism and and some kind of a dry religion and a cold formality friends no sir no sir give me the fire of the holy ghost not some garlic breath egyptian trying to take me back to a dead seminary psychology amen with no life in it with no movement in it with no emotion in it what a farce friends i have it's too late for me i've already crossed the jordan i'm not in the wilderness anymore we were sharing with the young people on sunday about the baptism the holy ghost what that really means is brother graham said the baptism holy ghost doesn't mean no more struggles it doesn't mean no more fighting actually when you get the holy ghost that's when the battle really begins but the wonderful thing is when you got the holy ghost you got something to battle with amen oh you got a cause friends because in that sanctification experience just trying to live and warm up you and just be a religious church member that's fighting for survival that's what they were doing it out in the wilderness wandering for years and years fighting for survival but in canaan we're fighting for our rights and there's a big difference between fighting for your rights and just fighting for survival because if you're fighting for your right spread rights for liberty rights for healing rights for the supernatural rights for power rights for the baptism of the holy ghost it's your right to have peace it's your right to have joy when you're fighting for that oh it puts a fight in your heart puts a fire in your belly puts a war cry in your mouth a battle shout a battle cry friends i'm ready to declare war i'm ready to declare war on every devil that standing between me and a total victory in christ every devil that would keep would try to keep me out of that inner place friends that and no devil has a right to enter that holy place amen i've got to write any devil that would try to trespass on my hidden life in christ he must be cast out because i have a right that i'm fighting for amen what it's time to do amen is not get messing around with a bunch of theology and psychology and trying to explain away the baptism of the holy ghost and make excuses for why the spirit's not moving in our churches and try to find some reason in the message why nobody got the holy ghost in your church for 10 years amen friends we got we got something to fight for not this ain't a time to give land away this is a time to fight for every step fight for every acre fight for every promise fight for the joy fight for the noise fight for the for the liberty of worship amen let's see it's a battle cry it's somebody who's not satisfied with just showing up to church and just going back the way they came or worse but it's somebody who wants to come and hear the preaching of the word and they want to they want to exercise a poll on that word because they're looking to receive something real that's why somebody would shout that's why somebody would cry out amen amen don't be afraid of that you know that noise is a part of holiness it's a part of holiness friends you know without that noise you're not even sanctified yet in the aaronic priesthood that priest that high priest was the only one who had the right to go in that inner place because he was the only one who went through that ritual of sanctification and he was the only one sanctified enough who had a right to go in there so he's typing the true believer right and he had to walk right he couldn't just walk anyway he wanted he had to walk a certain way he had to dress right he had to eat right he had to feed on the right things there was all these things that went into sanctification amen that would make him eligible for that experience of going in there and part of the see he had to dress he had to be dressed with the robes of holiness and part of those robes of holiness was a golden bell and a pomegranate there was a bell in a pomegranate that was on the hems of his robe how many know this is a scripture amen and he would walk a certain way and he would walk that way to make those bells make a noise amen they would play a certain song brother braham said that song was a holy holy holy uh unto the lord in other words he never entered the pro the he never entered silent into the presence of god when he went into the prayer yeah he was reverent but he was not silent no he went in with a noise playing a song amen with a singing with a wither with the noise friends oh brother bram said you know he said his first time he went around the pentecostals he said i noticed many of the young preachers were preaching and i listen to their message and i thought they were kind of noisy but then he said you know if you're not a little noisy that's a sign that you're dead if your religion hasn't got some emotion in it i can prove to you anything without emotion is dead he said when aaron went into the holiest of holies they put a pomegranate and a bell and the only way they knew that he was still alive in there amen it's because he made a noise amen every footstep that he had he was making a noise there was a noise in his life there was a song in his heart there was something that was ringing out until people didn't have to wonder is that brother saved is that brother is that brother got the holy ghost or is he just a church member no there was a witness there was a noise and the noise let them know amen they didn't have to cry out and say aaron are you alive in there they could hear that he was alive because they were all friends and anybody who's ever been shunned with god amen it is eating that fresh manna and in the riches of the glory of that shekinah presence you don't have to wonder if they're alive because you'll see that emotion you'll see that tears running down you'll hear that shout you'll see that dancing you'll see that smile you'll see that expression because if there's no expression if there's no emotion it's dead oh friends amen see i today i'm not trying to just be noisy i'm not trying to work up your emotion with this sermon honestly i'm just looking for a witness are you alive in there sure we're tabernacle are you alive in there oh then we ought to ring those bells amen we ought to be free to shout and rejoice and worship god there ought to be a holy holy holy unto the lord not just a holy life a sacrificial but a holy praise a holy worship holy hands lifted up in prayer holy holy oh and ring that bell in that pomegranate and let the world know in this world of death and this satan's eden when everybody's dead on the inside there's a little bride who's alive in there she's alive on the inside her heart is bursting with the glories of god ring that bell amen we got a bell in america called the liberty bell amen a long time ago it went through it used to ring for liberty but it got cracked and it's been worn down amen but but but you see there's thousands of replicas that were struck off of that bell amen and in this country we ring those liberty bells amen and that that ringing that that joyous noise that is testifying not that we were free but we ring it to remind the to make a memorial over the nation that we not only were free but we are free amen it's a and friends we're free this afternoon this evening we're free we're free from the yoke of sin we're free from the bondage of laodicea we're free from the pressures of this age we're free to soar above it all that's why we ring that bell that's why we worship god with a zeal with a passion with an emotion we ring it to remember our liberation just like israel at the red sea amen oh they danced because they were free they sang because they were free brother brahm said moses sing in the spirit miriam beat the tambourine all the daughters of israel and up and down the banks they went a dancing he said if that ain't a pentecostal meeting i don't know what one is oh someone said to me long ago said brother branham you're preaching this new kind of salvation aren't you you got this new you got this new salvation he said no she said oh i said ain't you got some of this new salvation no i got a new case of the old salvation that's right he said oh this is the oldest there is they said well when was it organized he said before the foundation of the world where were you when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy friends where were they they were in the mind of god oh hallelujah and as long as i've gone beyond the veil and i'm in christ why shouldn't i shout for joy i know that i'm a son i know that i've received my capstone i know that this message has come down to adopt me out of this world then i ought to shout because i'm just as much in the mind of god now as i was back there so i got a right to shout i got a right to sing for joy give me that old-time religion none of this post-modern layout seeing lukewarm amen bunch of well they're just just haphazard amen half-hearted religion but a true passionate emotional zealous reality hallelujah oh friends brother bram said people might say we're too emotional but he said it is an emotion well actually he said in one way it is emotion but he said anything that hasn't got emotion is dead now i know this is every evangelist favorite quote but maybe we ought to believe it if it hasn't got emotion that's a great sign that it's dead inside so if your religion he said hasn't got a little emotion about it you better bury it because it's dead you know i know this message has become so complicated and it has become so religious and so deep to people until they've got soul they got so you know doctrinally and mystery minded until they're afraid of any emotion but you know they wrote an old song back in the day that makes it real simple real simple and i think this is the deepest thing you might get tonight is the words to this song i sing because i shout because i dance because i'm happy and it doesn't have to get any deeper than that friends i believe oh we don't have to be scared of this the thing about it is when you when you come into the house of god you put all your sins under the blood and you're standing there in fellowship with the message of the hour and the word of god and something starts to stir in your heart you begin to think about where he's brought you from you begin to think about his goodness in your life you begin to think about the victories he's been giving you friends then it would be a sin not to shout it would be a sin not to be emotional because it would be a deception but we should worship from the honest heartfelt and genuine feelings of our heart and react to what the lord has done there's nothing sin oh friends what do you call somebody who's excited but they can't shout someone who's happy but they can't dance or move but they can't cry that's not mature that's dead that's dead and friends don't don't don't ever be deceived by that amen because that that deadness that lay out of sea and deadness it'll use any quote any scripture any rationale any reasoning that it can find anything it can come up with to justify why it's not dead but it's easy to tell that it's dead because it's got no emotion and it's got no movement it's got no feeling it ought to be the least descentful thing the least deceitful thing to someone who's really shut in with god and tasted this manna taste and see friends you'll never accept a substitute after that it's not mature it's dead you know friends you know uh you know the the thing of it is we're always gonna have people criticizing and there's always gonna be people trying to micromanage god and trying to question is this right is that right is that right is that right is that right and you can't hardly break into a dance with god or or something like that without the devil coming to your mind trying to make you think about what somebody else is thinking about it but you know i think i'm getting to the age finally friends where i just don't worry so much well p i think i'm going to be a big boy now amen i i i really it really uh i find that it just bothers me less and less what somebody might think about i know where i stand with god i know in whom i have believed i know my position in christ i'll shout if i want to i got something to shout about i got something to dance about i got something down deep in my heart gives me glorious feelings amen be free to worship god amen be honest and be sincere and be heartfelt don't withhold from the lord he loves the worship and the praises of his people amen if the praises of the angels were enough he never would have had to come to redeem us but he was not satisfied with an angelic worship but he called forth flawed sons of adam amen sinners come into the world speaking lies out of their mother's womb fallen and corrupt and he redeemed those people so that their praise would mean something to him their worship would mean something to him they would have a song that the angels couldn't sing they sent a message to give you a new song a new worship a new liberty a new freedom don't ever let anyone take it from you oh if you're still stuck in this sanctification court and you could talk about all the candlesticks and church ages or whatever but you ain't got your bells yet you might be smarter than me but you're not deeper because i'm in there i've gone past that court of religion past that court of sanctification passed the veil amen and i'm in the holy of holies in a personal communion with the shekinah glory and nothing is deeper than that there's no room deeper there's no experience deeper than to be then to be dead to your old husband and married and one with christ in that ark between the wings of the cherubim surrounded by the angels friends somebody who feels things but they can't freely express them that's a damaged person and we've got too many of our people too many of our young people i've been hearing testimonies too many young people have been damaged by somebody trying to bully them out of any emotion bullying them off of any feeling amen there ought to be nobody happier than a young person nobody with more pep in their step and more zeal in their heart than a young person and satan has tried to rob that amen but i will restore saith the lord i'll pour out my spirit and young men will prophesy and a young miriam will take a tambourine and have a dance i'll turn your ashes to rejoicing i'll turn your sorrows to glories i will restore i'll heal amen we got too many damaged people trying to make excuses why they're damaged excuses why they can't feel why they can't worship why they can't shout or why they can't dance stop making excuses run to this healer run to this rock get into the shelter until you stop worrying about what everyone else thinks and you can worship god like no one else in this world exists like you've been raptured up onto another planet amen i'll tell you could almost like brother man said speak another one to existence in your own mind and go there and worship god with abandon and with an open heart and freely you got a right to do that if if god's bride doesn't have a right to worship him who does if you don't have a right to worship him the angels should shut up amen the heavens should hold silent if the redeemed and ransom bride of jesus christ can't give him the glory we've been attacked by so many lies people have been so damaged people have been so bullied off of any emotion until they're afraid of it until we got people that they feel joy they feel freedom they feel like they got a victory they feel like they've been delivered but they dare not show it because of what someone might think oh france may god give us liberty tonight well you say well brother nathan he must be really woke up tonight he must be really on the defense because somebody called him up and criticized that his youth camp you know that personally i'm sure there were criticism personally i haven't heard a word a single word of criticism for anything that went on that whole weekend france and that's something we really got to get a hold of amen i have not heard a word of criticism about it and yet every young person amen who who breaks into worship amen people have been carrying those chains when those chains come off they fall noisy they fall they fall all of a sudden people feel light amen and then these young people got to deal with fake this attack in their mind and the devil's making a worry about what someone might say and you know we're going to all this worry and all of this in all of this this wrestling in our mind over about five miserable people amen who's never felt the joy of the lord in their life we ought to forget what the devil thinks we ought to we are not we ought to not to give that spirit the time of day we ought not to hardly legitimize it by speaking about it it's so insignificant in the face of a worthy god who's worthy of worship and praise hallelujah it's time to drown out the critics there's more with us than there are with them do you know that all of heaven's rejoicing with us brother brahm said according to the word of god what's happened in heaven at this time which is a sinner coming to christ he said angels are rejoicing the black flags of satan have been defeated they're down and chased out and the angels and their white victory flags amen are flying through heaven tonight and the bells of glory are ringing ringing melodies as for one sinner coming to christ what do you think's happening in heaven right now amen seeing the bound get set free seeing people have been under oppression get the victory see seeing seeing young people escaping the pressures of the laodicean world and rushing into that shelter of christ getting shut in with god friends i tell you heaven is rejoicing and it's rejoicing at such a level where some of these old critics if they were there they'd freeze to death brother bran i'm set amen think these coldly out of sea and winds or something wait till you get the goosebumps of glory amen when the to see the angels oh if we could only see him tonight just circle in the building amen just whirling through this place waving white flags saying yes people of god yes redeemed of the lord sing the song that we angels cannot sing we lift up the worship that we can't even know amen oh sing that new song of revelation hallelujah one sinner coming to christ you say brother nathan you're trying to get everybody worked up just so you can feel like a big prayer i know how your preachers are brother nathan you just want everybody to get pumped up and then you'll feel like you did something can i be honest with you tonight i'm not that small of a person amen my desires preach a word of substance my desire is to preach a word that will change your life my desire is to carry this message amen not and not measure my success by by an outward reaction of the people but i'll tell you what i am trying to do tonight amen is in the bible it spoke of a man named lazarus amen who was raised from death unto life and he was raised from death but you know that man was dead one moment and alive the next amen a perfect type of the resurrection of the baptism of the holy ghost but he found that even though he was raised alive he came waddling out of that tomb because he was wrapped up in all those grave clothes jesus raised him from the dead and he's just as alive that he could be but he couldn't raise his hand couldn't sing a shout because he was muffled he was bound he was tied up with those rags of sin and jesus sent the servants and said loose them loose him and let him go oh and what i'm trying with all my heart as we stand tonight hey man i'm just his servant today trying to help somebody just just get rid of a little more of those grave clothes just get a little less bound a little more free get a little more movement a little more voice a little less muffled friends because i know this world's pressing on you like it's pressing on me and i know he's the satan's doing everything he can to bind us up and hold us tight till we can't hardly move friends but there is a power the same power that raised you out of the death of sin is able to lose those grave clothes is able to put a joy where there used to be a joy maybe like you never had before a peace and a worship and a shout and a glory there's a lot of people say well you know i'm just a quiet person you know i don't i'm not that person who dances and shouts and screams maybe you're not but maybe you are and you just don't know it because you just never you never pushed against those grave clothes a little bit i i'm saying it because i know that's how it was for me amen where one day i'd be a young man you know with my head down self-conscious worried what somebody would think about me and then but the lord began to deal with me by the word and and you know then the next day it'd be maybe just i just raise a hand just nod my head and maybe whisper and amen whisper an amen but you know then that whisper turns to a shout and that little wave turns into a it turns into a dance you get looser and looser the more that you press against those grave clothes may god loosen someone today loose him and let him go let him worship god i'm i'm crying out to you lazarus are you alive in there are you alive in there let's have a word of prayer lord jesus i just deliver my heart tonight lord out of sincerity and i thank you for this wonderful people god that would respond to the preaching of the word such a simple thought oh god but it's such a reality father how we're just looking for a place lord for a way to let off the pressure of this world god we got people so bound up and so much condemnation so much pressure so much so many things in this world just sucking the joy right out of us oh god i pray that you'd restore our joy tonight father may you just do something supernatural in our midst there would be more lord than just a noisy service but god made the holy ghost do something in every heart lord and i and that includes me lord may you just go in there and shut me in there with you god and just lord may i remember what it feels like to be shut in with god and the world shut out and as if nobody else exists maybe somebody here tonight would enter into that holy of holies for the first time that holy ghost would just come in so sweetly that shekinah glory would brood over that heart and they say oh god set me free to worship you oh give me a reality give me something that'll hold me give me something that'll give me joy in a joyless world oh god may you grant it father may you put the broken pieces together lord not only the broken pieces of this sermon lord but the broken pieces of every heart those that have been bullied those that have been damaged those have been given complexes those that can't hardly raise a hand without thinking they've been taught to think what somebody might think lord what somebody might be criticizing somebody might call it a motion but god may we break through that may it be broken lord may those chains fall may those grave clothes come falling off god and may we be loosed lord to go on our christian life rejoicing singing ringing that bell in that pomegranate a fruitful life a joyous life granite lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i don't have a voice sing brothers [Music] there in the spirit beholding his face [Music] [Applause] [Music] with god amen if you desire prayer tonight we're happy to pray with you god [Music] [Music] to run in the [Music] with god [Music] with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face i'm getting new power [Music] with [Music] there's a worship in your heart you're just set free you don't care what anybody else says that's right you actually get shut in like i've rather preached it don't make any difference what anybody thinks i was thinking about it you know and one of the brothers ministered you know you know people shouted ball games and they just go crazy in fact they get in fights over certain things and they go berserk and you know the world don't think anything about that but you let a believer start opening up and praise the lord and worship the lord the devil don't like it i know nathan sent me a testimony from the meeting it's one of our dear sisters by the end it's one of your daughters i don't remember her name but in it right now but anyway she was set free so she can worship now and had a great love in her heart great love in her heart for other people oh my that's a victory can i give you a little testimony about worship it goes right along with this preaching tonight i haven't talked to my neighbor for quite a while i don't necessarily barge into his house and say hey robert what's going on now but he was out mowing yesterday and so we got in the conversation and i can put it right along with this incidentally he's further along in the church age booking i wanted to know what what his pastor thought about what his congregation well he he didn't mention a whole lot he showed it just showed him the book but he was really wondering who i was you know what's the deal with this guy i guess you know but he's an independent man but my neighbor was sharing with me he said you remember brother ray or not not didn't call me brother but ray he said remember about two years ago you actually prayed for me out on the lawn but he said i i had a a terrible case of anxiety terrorism anxiety and my blood pressure was up that's all he ever told me but yesterday he told me what was really behind it he said you know really i don't believe i ever told you [Music] but he said i was diagnosed i think it's called i don't know your medical people have to forgive me but something has to do a roman something but it has to do with a partial some type of leukemia some type of leukemia in his blood and he said you know one day i just i had a song in my heart i wanted to hear and somebody's singing i don't remember the name of the person but he said he started saying it and i started worshiping he said i just started just worshiping and he said i don't have a bit of that leukemia the lord heal them i've got repeat [Applause] so there's something about worship about praise and thanksgiving oh my god god bless you nathan i know that came from your heart we're a blessed people we're really a blessed people now as a pastor once again we're we're facing situations i find out about more sick people just before church so it you know you just have to be open and if if you can surrender let me lead okay and make decisions some of the churches gotta have already shut down brother donnie's and brother tim's before and i don't really want to do it i love church so i just want you to pray that the lord will guide us these people now there's different things happening some of it is cool but some of it is like ruth and i had a bad cold there's no fever no nothing and i i don't know what hit me saturday and i totally had i think it had something to do with my flu but i got an odd stomach anyway and uh but i was sick all night man and uh and just but uh so there's different things and i was told yesterday there is a stomach flu going around so the devil is on the rage again you know but god is greater god is a greater i'm so happy i could be here tonight amen why don't we worship a couple songs benjamin pick out a couple songs amen yes when god is in it labor now for wealth or fame there's a crown and you can win it if you'll go in jesus name oh little is [Music] for much or fame there's a crown and you can win it if you'll know in jesus name in the heart of his field now ripen there's a word for all to [Music] you little is much when god is in it labor not for wealth or faith there's a crown and you can win it if you'll go in jesus name does the place your call to labor seems so small and little known it is great if god is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] and our race on earth is run he will say if we are faithful welcome home my child well done little is much when god is [Music] there's a ground and you can win it [Music] in jesus name when we enter heaven's portal and our save your space we see [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] homie believes you're in that inner veil we're all as well the outside may be raging but on the inside of the inside it's you and god has nothing to do with the church it's between you and god it has nothing to do with your husband or your wife it's you and god and when that's there there ain't a devil that can take it how many enjoy the word tonight it's wonderful praise god let's pray father thank you for being so good to us again lord every service is important there's not a service that the word don't speak to us something that we can take as substance and put in our hearts and apply it lord may the pomegranates ring may we walk in the step of the word and may there be a shout in the camp to notify the devil we're alive and we're not going to die not going to die but we've been resurrected father thank you for that thank you for touching my heart tonight oh god thank you so much oh god such precious words we commit our travel home to you tonight protect your children we pray and be merciful to those that are sick may you take away the fevers may you undertake may you just keep brother ron and sister connie protected all the others that were with us shelter them lord as we give you praise and we give you thanksgiving in jesus name amen another thing about my neighbor it seems like there's quite a thing happening in the family robert's sister and brother-in-law are ready to leave their catholic church so there's just something to have a revival sort of like stirring you know not everybody may have not been the bride but they're accepting what's happening and when the man like him can say ray god is on the move we ought to be able to say in a greater way god is on the move he's not going to stop until we get that body changed god bless you amen take care as you go and bless your heart amen go ahead and say i've got so much thank him for [Music] so much to praise him for you see he has been so good to me and when i think of what he's done and where he's brought me from my god so much to thank him for [Music] yes i've got so much to thank him for [Music] so much [Music] to me [Music] and when i think of what he's done and where he's brought me from my god so much to thank him for [Music] so much to thank you [Music] [Music] i think [Music] so much [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] you
