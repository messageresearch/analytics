[1:35] Amen. to see God still moving on hearts,
[1:38] saving saving souls and dealing with
[1:40] lives. Amen. I I believe that one of
[1:43] these days the last one's going to come
[1:45] in. This bride's just going to go. Amen.
[1:48] She's just going to take liberty. Amen.
[1:50] I just want to take a few minutes in the
[1:52] word tonight. But just before we do,
[1:54] could we just bow our hearts for a word
[1:56] to prayer? Almighty God, we thank you
[1:59] tonight for your grace, Lord. We thank
[2:01] you for the mercy which you have shown
[2:03] to us, Lord, to open our eyes, to let us
[2:07] see the times and the days that we are
[2:10] living. Father, your timing, your grace,
[2:13] your leadership, Lord. Oh, how there's
[2:17] no way, Lord, that we could even pretend
[2:20] to think that we're always aware of what
[2:23] you're doing. But Lord, once in a while,
[2:25] we look up and we realize that we're
[2:28] right in the place that you designed for
[2:30] us to stand. We're so thankful tonight
[2:33] that your great spirit can still move
[2:35] your church and lead it, Lord. And
[2:38] tonight we just want to offer our hearts
[2:40] to you. We ask you as we would study
[2:42] your word tonight. May the spirit of
[2:45] inspiration and wisdom, Lord, and
[2:47] understanding move among your church and
[2:50] ignite hearts and bless them, Father.
[2:52] May we be caught up in the revelation,
[2:55] Lord, that'll that'll show us great
[2:57] things, Father. Now, we commit this
[2:59] service into thine hands. In the name of
[3:01] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen.
[3:05] Amen. God bless you tonight. If you have
[3:08] your Bibles, Amen. I am going to be
[3:10] continuing uh this subject, but I want
[3:12] to do it from Job the 32nd chapter. Uh I
[3:16] want to read the 32nd uh verses 7 and
[3:19] verses 8 and also 2 Timothy chapter 3
[3:23] and verse 16. Amen. Second Timothy verse
[3:28] 3:1 16. Job chap Job chapter 32 and
[3:32] verse 7.
[3:34] For I said days should speak and
[3:38] multitude of years should teach
[3:41] wisdom. But there is a spirit in a man
[3:46] and the
[3:47] inspiration of the Almighty giveth them
[3:51] understanding.
[3:53] Also would like to read second Timothy
[3:55] chapter 3 the 16th verse.
[3:58] For all scripture, it is given by
[4:01] inspiration of God. And it is profitable
[4:05] for doctrine, reprove, for correction,
[4:08] and for instruction and righteousness.
[4:11] May God bless his word tonight. And if I
[4:14] would uh you could be seated. If I would
[4:16] take a a subtitle to this, I'm just
[4:18] going to speak to you about the
[4:19] inspiration of the Almighty. Amen. U
[4:22] just some things that are are laying
[4:24] real on my heart. I've been uh studying
[4:27] in this area of the seals. And of
[4:29] course, if you're following along the
[4:31] series, you're watching the first and
[4:32] second seal. And I'm just pulling a lot
[4:34] of things from there. I'm not really
[4:36] titling it the seals because there's a
[4:39] lot of things that I'm just bringing the
[4:41] revelations as we catch them under the
[4:43] seals and then just speaking about them.
[4:45] Uh and uh I'm not uh trying to
[4:48] systematically teach such as a teacher
[4:50] would teach. uh but yet maybe just a
[4:53] little more uh the subject of it and
[4:56] teaching along. So sometimes if I say
[4:58] something that would maybe be uh maybe
[5:00] that you wouldn't exactly uh hear it the
[5:03] same way or you maybe would need a quote
[5:05] or something like that, it's okay to ask
[5:07] because I have quotes and and scriptures
[5:09] backing these thoughts. But sometimes I
[5:12] find that it's it's stays a little more
[5:14] dynamic if we just say it instead of
[5:16] read it. Amen. And uh so sometimes we
[5:19] just uh just say it directly and then
[5:21] trusting that you all uh know exactly
[5:23] where I'm at in this. But I'd like to
[5:25] maybe just look into this a little bit
[5:26] today. I just real heavy on my heart. Uh
[5:29] woke up the other morning and it just uh
[5:31] the inspiration of the Lord just
[5:33] speaking uh to my heart about the
[5:35] inspiration of God. And you know I I I
[5:38] think uh when you read the scripture
[5:40] here uh this is uh this is a time in the
[5:43] book of Job uh in the 32nd chapter is
[5:46] when Job has been uh he has been in a
[5:49] real battle and and the scripture is
[5:51] telling us how that Job has been going
[5:54] through all these great trials and these
[5:55] great struggles and of course Job is in
[5:58] the dark completely about what's really
[6:01] going on and what has happened. God. And
[6:03] the devil has had a conversation about
[6:05] him. And he really don't know what the
[6:07] battle's all about. He just knows that
[6:09] he's suffering. And in that suffering,
[6:11] he's he's uh he's pretty disgusted. When
[6:14] the scriptures, you can see that, Amen.
[6:16] He don't he he's he keeps telling them,
[6:18] "I didn't do anything to deserve this,
[6:20] and I don't understand this." And and
[6:22] he's going along like this. and and
[6:24] three of his friends come along and and
[6:26] they get to talking to him and they're
[6:28] just certain that he's a sinner and
[6:30] they're they're certain that there's
[6:32] some things, amen, that's just not been
[6:34] qualified or you're not talking about.
[6:36] But there's got to be a reason behind
[6:38] what's happening here. And and between
[6:40] those three and Job, amen, there really
[6:43] got a discussion going on. You can and
[6:45] you can read that first parts of the
[6:46] book of Job and you'll find their
[6:48] discussions in great intent. Amen. But
[6:50] it's in the 32nd chapter when things
[6:52] begin to change because the scripture
[6:55] says that there's a young priest that or
[6:57] young prince that comes down from the
[6:59] east and his name is Elohoo. Now in Job
[7:02] 32, Elohu is introduced and if you've
[7:05] never studied Eloh it's a beautiful
[7:06] study. Brother Bannon breaks into the
[7:08] name of Elohoo and he takes them first
[7:10] letters of Ella and he shows you he says
[7:13] see Eel speaks of God and he says I want
[7:16] you to see that this man come down from
[7:18] the east. Amen. Now he coming from the
[7:20] east is very significant to the church.
[7:22] Amen. Because Amen. as the lightning
[7:25] would come from the east unto the west
[7:28] so shall the coming of the son of man
[7:30] be. And so he was coming from the east.
[7:32] And brother Bam said his name was Elohoo
[7:35] coming down to meet Job. This is a
[7:37] perfect type of Christ coming to Job.
[7:41] Amen. This man named Eloh. Brother Bam
[7:43] says that in one place he is
[7:45] representing Jesus Christ.
[7:48] In another place, brother Brandham says
[7:49] it like this. Elohoo. He says he came
[7:52] down to Job and he says, "You've been
[7:54] watching all these things. Now, he's
[7:55] coming a just man who's going to stand
[7:58] in the breach for sinful man and a holy
[7:59] God." So, he comes down and he's
[8:01] starting to answer Job's questions
[8:03] because Job's got a lot of questions
[8:05] about why that the flowers uh would go
[8:08] and come and go and come so quickly, but
[8:10] man, he goes into the ground, doesn't
[8:12] come again. And Elohoo has answers that
[8:14] Job has not yet understood. and he
[8:17] begins to preach to him and he and and
[8:19] he actually in Job 32 it's pretty an
[8:22] amazing reading if you want to go read
[8:23] it the first couple verses there he
[8:25] actually already told Job he said now
[8:27] I've let you talk and I've let you talk
[8:29] till you've run out of things to say
[8:31] amen and and he says I let you do it
[8:33] because you're the elder and that's why
[8:34] I read the scripture because he says in
[8:36] other words that that all these things
[8:38] that you have thought we've let you put
[8:39] them all out there and then Elohoo says
[8:42] to him but there is a spirit in a man
[8:44] and he said and the inspiration ation of
[8:46] the Almighty which bringeth
[8:47] understanding. Now you you you uh uh
[8:50] just give me a little liberty here, but
[8:52] can I say this? The spirit of iniquity
[8:54] has been at work now for about six ages.
[8:57] Amen. And man has said everything there
[9:00] is to say about what's to be and how the
[9:02] church is be. But that when when the
[9:04] message comes along, a strong angel
[9:07] descending out of the heavens, you see
[9:09] that strong angel is coming with fresh
[9:11] inspiration. Amen. when the when the
[9:14] church world is becoming silent is when
[9:16] God begins to really speak and we find
[9:19] amen that this is exactly what was
[9:21] happening to Job is he needed a fresh
[9:23] inspiration. Brother Bam goes into it
[9:25] and says that he's sitting on an ash
[9:27] heap and he said, "Oh, is he sitting
[9:29] there in a time of crit in a great
[9:31] crisis and that's when Christ comes to
[9:34] him and he begins to speak of Elohoo and
[9:37] he says what Elohoo did is he come down
[9:40] to explain to him there is a ransom that
[9:43] there's somebody that can stand between
[9:45] man and God. Amen. Elohoo really means
[9:48] that Christ came to Jo to Job. I'm just
[9:51] reading quotes. Amen. And he says he's a
[9:54] prince and he says he's a manifestation
[9:56] of the pre-nowledge of the Lord Jesus
[9:59] Christ. It was Eloh speaking to him. And
[10:02] when the spirit began to speak, that's
[10:04] when the thunder began to roll. That's
[10:06] when Job, now brother said, but Job
[10:08] being a prophet, amen, had got out of
[10:11] sorts and he was all messed up. But when
[10:13] Elohoo begins to speak to him under the
[10:16] fresh inspiration of the word, he said
[10:19] that began to put binoculars back on the
[10:21] eyes of Job. And then he began to see he
[10:24] began to understand what it was that was
[10:26] going on. See, inspiration begin to come
[10:29] to the prophet under Eloh's message. I I
[10:32] think it's a pretty powerful thing
[10:34] because it's in Job chapter 42. This is
[10:37] when Job actually comes around and
[10:39] begins to say in Job chapter 42, he
[10:42] begins then to discuss this. And this is
[10:44] the sermon brother preached the message
[10:46] called I have heard, but now I see.
[10:49] Amen. I have heard of thee by the
[10:52] hearing of the ear, but now I see. Now,
[10:54] I don't know if if you ever caught this.
[10:56] I never really caught the reality of
[10:58] this, but brother Brandham is discussing
[11:01] the message that Elohoo has brought to
[11:03] Job. He has been hearing this the whole
[11:06] time, but now Job finally says, "I have
[11:09] heard, but now I see." Amen. So, the
[11:12] inspiration that was coming to him,
[11:15] Amen, then became a vision to him. And
[11:18] brother Bam said he began to see the
[11:19] manifested reality or the vindicated
[11:22] word and then it became a great vision
[11:25] unto Job. I say this tonight. I I
[11:28] certainly believe amen. Amen. That
[11:30] Elohoo wanted Job to hold his peace so
[11:33] he could learn something that he could
[11:34] change his confession. The Bible tells
[11:36] us that he actually told Job, if you'll
[11:39] hold your peace, he said, "I will set
[11:41] their words in order." Ain't that
[11:43] something that this this this this this
[11:46] prince from the east was coming to
[11:48] redevelop the way Job thought and the
[11:51] way Job talked and to redesign and set
[11:54] his words in order. I said, "Oh God, I
[11:57] pray tonight," Amen. that inspiration
[11:59] does that for you and I. Amen. That it
[12:02] gives us a a new order of the way we see
[12:05] things and the way we do things. That
[12:07] inspiration can bring them. I certainly
[12:09] believe that inspiration comes from the
[12:12] word of God. That's why we come to the
[12:14] house of God because it's the preaching
[12:16] of the word and the the scriptures
[12:18] themselves were given by inspiration and
[12:21] you know they will give us inspiration.
[12:23] They will bring inspiration to our
[12:25] lives. Sometimes when we get maybe a
[12:28] little sideways or we get out of the way
[12:29] and we lose focus of what the big
[12:32] picture is, of what is really happening,
[12:34] that's when God will come in and then
[12:37] use the gospel to redirect our minds and
[12:39] set us back in the paths and re reform
[12:42] our confession, sets our words back in
[12:45] order that we might understand the
[12:47] things of God. Listen folks, there is
[12:49] power in understanding.
[12:52] There is power in understanding. The
[12:54] inspiration of the Almighty will bring
[12:57] us understanding. How could we talk
[12:59] about understanding without speaking
[13:01] back of the book of Daniel and looking
[13:03] at how that Daniel was living in the
[13:05] time of Nebuchadnezzar and when Babylon
[13:08] had come up and had overtook Jerusalem
[13:10] and had tore down their places of
[13:12] worship and had carried them over. Amen.
[13:14] And and had brought them into bondage
[13:16] and and we know the Bible said they had
[13:18] been there about 70 years. And brother
[13:20] Ram says in the book of Daniel, that's
[13:22] when Daniel seeing the time that he was
[13:25] living and he began to grow desperate
[13:27] because he be to understand by the books
[13:31] that the time was drawing near. I tell
[13:33] you, brother Brand pulls that out
[13:35] beautifully in Daniel 70s and tells us
[13:38] he says just like me. He said, I've been
[13:40] reading and by the books he said, I see
[13:42] Elijah supposed to come in the last day
[13:44] and I see the son of man is supposed to
[13:46] appear. See, I I' I've heard these
[13:49] things. Amen. But let inspiration become
[13:51] a vision that we might see them and
[13:54] bring them into our understanding. Amen.
[13:57] It's in this season when Daniel begin to
[14:00] see the end and desperation begin to
[14:02] come. See, in the end of the of the of
[14:05] the of the time of Babylon was the
[14:08] beginning of the gentile kingdoms. Now,
[14:10] if you're a Bible reader, you can go
[14:12] back to the book of Daniel. And if
[14:14] you're nervous about world events, let
[14:16] me let me just give you a a little word
[14:18] here. Let's set our let's set our
[14:20] confession back in order. God is in
[14:21] control of everything.
[14:24] God has never lost control of nothing.
[14:27] And people say, "Well, why is the world
[14:29] in the shape that it's in?" Because God
[14:31] sent two spirits into the earth, truth
[14:33] and error. Amen. And God will never lead
[14:36] a man into era. So, he sends the truth
[14:39] into the age to lead the people under
[14:41] the truth. But people turn down the
[14:44] truth and believe a lie and they follow.
[14:47] Amen. The prophet said it. He said they
[14:49] followed the spirit of error until they
[14:51] get in the cage of unclean birds. Right.
[14:53] Amen. So that God has never lost
[14:56] control. Not one moment. And in the book
[14:58] of Daniel from all the way back there in
[15:01] the Babylonian kingdom, the first
[15:03] gentile kingdom, Daniel prophesies and
[15:06] tells us of every world kingdom that's
[15:09] going to be on the earth from the time
[15:11] of Daniel all the way to the millennium.
[15:14] Amen. and then tells us who will rule in
[15:17] the millennium showing Jesus as the king
[15:19] of the earth. Now, powerful things.
[15:21] Amen. But just as Daniel was seeing the
[15:24] end of the Babylonian kingdom, remember
[15:26] this is when the the the handwriting
[15:29] come up on the wall and he seen it there
[15:31] and if I was a better pronunciator, I
[15:33] would I would pronounce it for you. But
[15:36] I think it's mini tickle uh uh
[15:38] something. and and it comes up on the
[15:40] wall and he and the Bible tells us that
[15:42] it's at the time they're in a great
[15:44] feast of Belchazar. Amen. And and when
[15:46] he sees it, that's when the king says,
[15:48] "Well, who could tell us what was
[15:50] written?" And Daniel begins to say,
[15:51] "You've been weighing the balance and
[15:53] found wanting." Right? The handwriting
[15:55] was on the wall, but it took the spirit
[15:58] of inspiration to say what it meant to
[16:00] them now. Now, they knew something was
[16:03] happening, but what it was, they didn't
[16:05] know. Amen. And when they seen that, it
[16:08] needed the gift of inspiration. Brother
[16:10] Bham says, see, he says, just like it's
[16:13] promised in these last days, that the
[16:15] gifts will return back into the church
[16:18] if you don't deny the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[16:21] There is a there is watersh of that one
[16:24] river of the spirit and there are gifts
[16:26] in the body. And brother man said, "The
[16:28] greatest of all them gifts is wisdom
[16:30] that would be able to take that word and
[16:32] put it together, amen, to let you know
[16:34] where you're living, let let you know
[16:36] where you are." And the spirit of wisdom
[16:38] was prophesied in the Bible to return in
[16:41] the last days. Because this bride, amen,
[16:44] is not going to be caught as a thief in
[16:46] the night, but she is standing under the
[16:48] shining light. Amen. of Malachi 4 and
[16:51] Luke 17:30. Amen. Of Isaiah 60, it said,
[16:55] "The light of God had come in the age.
[16:57] Wisdom has entered the age. The mind of
[17:00] God has been opened under prophetic word
[17:03] and has read the handwriting on the
[17:05] wall." Come on, y'all know the
[17:07] handwriting. Sodom is everywhere. What
[17:09] does it mean? Why is homosexuality
[17:11] moving in the Sodom law and how those
[17:14] taken over the world and the pressure
[17:15] and the push? What does it mean? It
[17:18] means the Bible said, "As it was in the
[17:20] days of Sodom, so shall it be in the
[17:23] coming of the son of man." Come on.
[17:25] There's some things hiding in there. If
[17:26] it's the days of Sodom, it's the days of
[17:28] Abraham. And Abraham had a visitation
[17:31] from an angel that told them world
[17:33] events and gave them a message that
[17:35] would change their bodies. Amen. I tell
[17:38] you what, God, Amen, has got some things
[17:40] hidden in there. Why is it that
[17:42] everybody is after evil? Come on now.
[17:45] It's not just homosexuality, but the
[17:47] sons of God would look at the daughters
[17:48] of men and lust and passion will enter
[17:51] the age and sensuality will be
[17:53] everywhere. It's a handwriting on the
[17:56] wall. But what does it mean? As it was
[17:59] in the days of Noah, so shall it be in
[18:01] the coming of the son of man when every
[18:03] man's mind would every imagination even
[18:06] would be upon evil.
[18:09] We are living those days out.
[18:12] We could say it this day. This scripture
[18:15] is fulfilled. Jesus prophesied 2,000
[18:19] years ago and we're standing in
[18:21] prophecy. There is a six-point flag of
[18:24] Israel flying over a nation that's been
[18:27] dead for years. For 2,000 years. Amen.
[18:30] Hebrew was dead. The nation was dead.
[18:32] But tonight, they're alive with an army
[18:35] and a and a government and money. And
[18:37] the Hebrew language has been
[18:39] resurrected. What does it mean? The fig
[18:41] tree that put forth their buds. Know
[18:44] this, the time is nigh, church. There's
[18:47] signs. There's signs of the time. There
[18:49] signs of the power of God. But you just
[18:52] got to know how to read them.
[18:54] Hallelujah. The inspiration, the
[18:56] handwriting on the wall. Daniel saw it
[18:58] and he knew what it meant and he told
[19:00] him, "Your your kingdom is at an end."
[19:03] That's what this means. It's come to an
[19:05] end. Amen. You see, Amen. that whenever
[19:09] the inspiration of God comes upon
[19:11] something, then the Holy Spirit can
[19:14] unveil what it really means. Now, I've
[19:16] been in this series in the book of
[19:18] Revelation. Just for the last few uh
[19:20] times, I've been looking strong at this
[19:22] first and second seal, and I've been
[19:24] watching this white horse change under
[19:26] the red horse. And and because we have
[19:28] the answer, it's pretty easy to back up
[19:30] and see the problem. Uh you know, if you
[19:33] don't know what the answer is, it's
[19:34] different. You know, I'm not I'm not an
[19:35] algebra guy, but Amen. You give me any
[19:38] problem you want long as you give me the
[19:39] answer.
[19:42] I do not care what kind of problem you
[19:44] give me. If you give me the answer, it
[19:46] no matter how mysterious it looks, I got
[19:48] the answer. So the the Bible is
[19:52] predicting things in this age that is
[19:54] very mysterious, very problematic, but I
[19:58] got the answer. Say, well, you're just a
[20:01] simpleton. You don't have no formal
[20:03] education. You're not really a preacher
[20:05] through a seminary. But see, I still got
[20:07] the answer.
[20:09] That's right. I still got the answer.
[20:13] Because God has sent the spirit of
[20:15] inspiration and wisdom in our age to
[20:18] give this bride a vision. Yes, sir. How
[20:21] many knows a vision is a direct
[20:23] revelation of the word?
[20:25] In the book of Samuel, y'all, we learned
[20:27] that from there, right? The word of the
[20:28] Lord was precious in those days because
[20:30] there was no open vision. There was no
[20:32] prophet. But when a prophet comes, he
[20:35] gives a vision to the people. And that
[20:38] vision then, no matter,
[20:42] no matter if you're the widow at
[20:43] Zerapath and you're out of Ool, it's a
[20:45] fresh thing. And no matter if we have
[20:48] extinguished our understanding, when the
[20:50] message begins to speak, it's a fresh
[20:52] thing and it sets us back in order. I I
[20:56] think of this when I'd look at the age
[20:58] we're living in. And I've been studying
[20:59] this and watching the changing of this
[21:02] horse from the first from this red horse
[21:04] uh from this uh white to this red and
[21:06] then now starting to follow it into this
[21:09] black. And I I want to maybe just pick
[21:11] it up for a moment in Revelations 13.
[21:13] Amen. Now, because we're looking at at
[21:15] the inspiration, Daniel was under it.
[21:18] And do you know Daniel and John saw the
[21:20] same thing? That's right. They saw the
[21:23] same thing. Now, go open. If you got
[21:25] your Bibles, we just follow with me or
[21:27] you can pull it up. Revelations 13.
[21:29] Amen. Now, uh I want to read here and
[21:32] see the scripture says this. Amen. And I
[21:34] stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw
[21:37] a beast rise up out of the sea having
[21:39] seven heads, 10 horns, and upon his his
[21:43] horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the
[21:45] name of blasphemy. Boy, that seems like
[21:48] a problem, doesn't it? That seems like
[21:50] an unsolvable symbology. Who would know
[21:53] what it was? But we certainly have the
[21:55] answer tonight of exactly what this is.
[21:58] Amen. You you you can watch the
[22:00] scripture now. And I saw a beast rising
[22:03] up out of the sea. I saw a beast. Now,
[22:05] what does that beast actually what is
[22:07] it? Who is it? What does it mean? Beast
[22:09] actually is symbology for power. As we
[22:12] talked to you the other Sunday, this is
[22:14] speaking the difference in zoo and
[22:16] theionon. This is not a living creature
[22:19] which is a beast of God. This is the
[22:22] spirit of the devil acting out in a
[22:24] power in in the world. Amen. Now, if you
[22:27] want to know what that beast is, you you
[22:29] can look in Revelations the 17th chapter
[22:32] and you can read it real easy there.
[22:35] Amen. And you can see how the scripture
[22:37] tells us, amen, in the third verse. And
[22:39] he carried away in the spirit and I saw
[22:40] a woman sat upon a scarlet colored beast
[22:43] and it was full of names of blasphemy,
[22:45] seven heaven, seven heads and 10 horns.
[22:48] So the same beast of Revelations 13 is
[22:50] the same beast of Revelation 17. Amen.
[22:53] And I stood upon it and saw a beast
[22:55] rising up out of the sea. Now somebody
[22:57] said, "What does it mean?" It's coming
[22:59] out of the sea. That's coming out of
[23:01] water. In Revelations 17 and verse 15,
[23:04] the Bible says that the water actually
[23:07] represents a multitude of people. So we
[23:11] got we got our our symbology now. Out of
[23:14] the sea. So there is a beast rising out
[23:17] of the sea and it has seven heads which
[23:19] in the book of revelations we find the
[23:22] seven heads representing the seven heels
[23:25] and can I just say it openly the seven
[23:27] heels of Rome. I was just there and they
[23:30] got seven heels in Rome. Now somebody
[23:32] say well there's other cities that have
[23:33] seven hills but there's no other city in
[23:35] the world that rules over
[23:37] kings and there's there's no other city
[23:40] in the world amen which was the capital
[23:42] of this Roman Empire. Now watch uh watch
[23:44] how he says seven seven horns amen or
[23:47] seven heads which also represent now now
[23:50] I don't want to get too fast but if you
[23:52] if if I get too fast somebody har amen
[23:54] but this seven heads also represents the
[23:58] seven kings which are the the dictators
[24:01] of the Roman Empire at the time the book
[24:04] of revelations is being written. You
[24:05] remember, Amen. He says that there's
[24:07] already been six. And he says, "And then
[24:09] there'll come one short and speaking of
[24:11] Titus." And then we seen it moved right
[24:14] over. And then Paul uh uh uh John is
[24:16] actually and we have the names of them.
[24:18] I don't want to read them, but we have
[24:19] the actual names of the dictators that
[24:22] which were the seven emperors before it
[24:24] became pagan to paple. Yeah. Now, these
[24:27] seven uh heads which were the seven
[24:30] heels and the seven dictators and the 10
[24:32] horns, Amen. which are representing the
[24:35] the kingdoms. And upon the horns were 10
[24:38] crowns. It's showing you actually in
[24:41] here is speaking of kings or rulers.
[24:44] Amen. And these are the the dictators.
[24:47] Amen. That will be with this beast.
[24:49] Amen. Now watch. And upon his head, he
[24:52] had the name of blasphemy. Now you say,
[24:55] "Preacher, what is that?" That's Rome.
[24:57] And it's coming up out of a multitude of
[24:59] people. Amen. Now watch the scripture
[25:02] because it says, "And the beast which I
[25:04] saw was likened unto a leopard and his
[25:07] feet was as the feet of a bear and his
[25:09] mouth as the mouth of a lion and the
[25:11] dragon gave him power and his seat and
[25:14] great authority." Brother uh can you
[25:16] give me that picture of uh the Roman
[25:18] Empire under Daniel with the uh with the
[25:21] Nebuchadnezzar's image. Amen. Now you're
[25:23] looking at this at this picture again
[25:25] because it's just too good a picture.
[25:26] There's not I don't know a better
[25:28] picture than this one. you the
[25:30] Revelations 13 and2 when you're reading
[25:32] those four creatures on the right side
[25:34] you see them in four different kingdoms
[25:37] you see them divided uh uh four
[25:39] different kingdoms but when you're
[25:40] reading them right here you're actually
[25:43] reading in Revelations 13 and2 you're
[25:46] reading them all as one power so all
[25:50] that that was behind the kingdoms of the
[25:53] world become one power behind Rome now
[25:57] if you watch this that Roman Empire
[25:59] empire then becomes a divided kingdom.
[26:02] Amen. And and we see it then as it
[26:04] becomes papal Rome. You see the do you
[26:06] see the actual two legs that's on this
[26:09] image and you're watching the I'm going
[26:11] to leave it up a moment because you're
[26:12] watching the empires. The Babylonian
[26:13] Empire, the Persian Empire, the Grecian
[26:15] Empire, the Roman Empire, and then
[26:18] you're watching the divided kingdom. Now
[26:20] them 10 horns that's in Revelations 13
[26:23] are the 10 toes that's on this image.
[26:27] And those 10 toes all have leaders,
[26:29] right? And the two main leaders all the
[26:31] way back in brother Brandham's day where
[26:33] the two big toes was Eisenhower and
[26:36] Cruchov. Yeah. Remember that? Because
[26:39] you see the iron and the clay mingle
[26:41] together. What's that mean? It means
[26:43] that Catholicism is going to mingle into
[26:46] every nation of the earth. The world
[26:49] right now, whether you know it or not,
[26:51] United Nations has divided the nations
[26:53] of the world in 10 magnum kingdoms and
[26:56] they have joined together 10 different
[26:57] one. Now, now you said, "Preacher, I I
[26:59] don't want to get way off on something.
[27:00] I just want to make it known to you."
[27:03] Amen. That there's there's things that's
[27:04] happening in the world that we actually
[27:06] don't know about. We we have we have a
[27:08] lot of answers, but there's things back
[27:10] here that's going we don't have no clue
[27:12] what's actually transpiring in the dark
[27:14] places. Amen. But you watch this how
[27:16] that these comes together in Revelations
[27:19] 13. All of them become one power. And
[27:22] the scripture says, "And the dragon gave
[27:25] him power and his great seed and great
[27:28] authority." Now, who is that dragon that
[27:31] gives power to this? Amen. Somebody
[27:33] said, "Well, who's the dragon?" Well,
[27:35] that's a good question. If you like your
[27:37] scriptures in Revelations the 12th
[27:39] chapter, it answers the question. In the
[27:42] third per verse, it says, "And there
[27:43] appeared another wonder in heaven, and
[27:45] behold, a great red dragon having seven
[27:47] heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon
[27:50] his head." In the in the uh ninth verse,
[27:53] it says, "And the great dragon which was
[27:56] cast out, that old serpent called the
[27:58] devil." So the dragon is the devil.
[28:02] Amen. That old devil gave his power to
[28:05] this seat and his authority. So, so this
[28:08] seat, now if you're a study of the
[28:10] church age book, you know that it was
[28:12] the Pergamus age that was the seat of
[28:15] Satan. How many knows that Pergamus was
[28:18] in Asia? Give me that next picture. Now,
[28:20] watch him. Watch the two legs on that.
[28:22] Now, Pergamus was in Asia. Now, here are
[28:24] the two capitals of the Roman Empire,
[28:27] Eastern, Western. The eastern on the on
[28:30] the right over here is Constantinople
[28:32] and Turkey. And you see, it's the
[28:34] Eastern Roman Empire, known to you
[28:36] historians as the uh the it's not
[28:38] Benzanite. It's the um Byzantine. The
[28:42] Benzanite was the name of the capital.
[28:44] But you but you watch the two legs. You
[28:46] see the two legs of of Nebuchadnezzar's
[28:48] image. It was divided kingdoms, right?
[28:50] And then we see that Pergamus was right
[28:52] here next to Constantinople. And that's
[28:54] where the seed of Satan was given
[28:57] through Babylonian secrets. Now I'm I'm
[29:01] I'm in your I'm in your church age book.
[29:02] If you haven't studied it, go to
[29:04] Pergamist Age and you'll see. Brother
[29:06] Bram said, "How did it become the seed
[29:07] of Satan?" He said, "Babylon had secret
[29:10] mysteries of the religion." And he said,
[29:12] "Whenever that they come under attack,
[29:15] the king priest of Babylon rushed
[29:17] himself to Pergamus." And he said in
[29:20] Pergamus, he taught his religion. And
[29:23] then whenever it come to a certain point
[29:25] under Adalus when he died, he willed his
[29:29] kingdom to Julius Caesar. The same as
[29:32] you would will your house or your land.
[29:34] He wield his kingdom to Julius Caesar,
[29:36] which made Julius Caesar Pontis Maximus,
[29:39] which he became a spiritual leader and
[29:42] the civil leader over Rome. But this is
[29:44] predating Christ, right? Julius Caesar.
[29:46] Amen. This is predating Christ. So So
[29:49] what what's go? What are you what are
[29:51] you talking about? Well, let's just see
[29:52] that the devil gave him the seat and the
[29:56] authority of the Roman Empire and this
[29:58] beast is rising up out of the sea. But
[30:01] if you want to watch this, it says in
[30:03] the third verse, "But I saw one of his
[30:04] heads as it was wounded to death and his
[30:08] deadly wound would have healed and all
[30:10] the world wandered at this beast." Now
[30:13] what you're watching right there in the
[30:14] scripture happened in history when the
[30:17] pagan Rome when when the Babylonian Rome
[30:21] as you know under Julius Caesar and
[30:23] under Titus and when when that became
[30:26] moved from a paganism to a papal Rome
[30:30] where they left the idea of paganism and
[30:33] they joined together their pagan ideas
[30:36] with Christianity and they formed
[30:38] themselves a papal Rome which come under
[30:41] Constantine. You know from the other
[30:42] service we preached the other day. I
[30:44] don't want to go through all that real
[30:45] clear. Amen. But it was under
[30:47] Constantine. Now what looks like
[30:49] happened is it looked like the pagan
[30:51] Rome completely died. But it didn't
[30:54] because its deadly wound was healed when
[30:57] the papo Rome or the pope took the
[31:00] leadership of the Roman Empire and he
[31:03] became ruler of both spiritual world and
[31:07] natural world. He became a papo Rome. So
[31:11] his deadly wound was healed and the
[31:13] Bible said and they all would have
[31:14] worshiped the dragon which had gave
[31:16] power unto the beast and they worshiped
[31:18] the beast saying who is like this beast
[31:21] and is who is able to make war. Now
[31:24] isn't it amazing the scriptures are
[31:25] detailing to us that people will begin
[31:28] to worship the devil as they worship the
[31:31] beast and its image. The whole world
[31:33] would have worshiped at the wonder of
[31:35] this thing and he was given unto him.
[31:39] Now for time's sake, let's look in the
[31:42] eth verse. And all that dwell upon the
[31:44] earth shall worship him whose names were
[31:47] not written in the book of life of the
[31:49] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[31:52] world. Now isn't that something? The
[31:54] Bible is telling us the whole earth now
[31:56] is going to worship this image of this
[31:59] beast and its and its dragon except that
[32:02] their names was in the lamb's book of
[32:05] life from the foundation of the world.
[32:06] Now, what does that have to do with
[32:09] knowing who that beast is? Now, now
[32:11] y'all forgive me, but I don't think that
[32:13] any of us was going to come up with
[32:15] these answers on our own. Amen. But God
[32:18] put a seed in you, and that seed was a
[32:21] gene seed, uh, the soul of God, if you
[32:23] would, that you were deity in the
[32:25] foundations of God's mind, and have come
[32:28] into this age. And because you are here,
[32:31] God promised that he would not leave his
[32:34] bride. Amen. under this uh under this
[32:37] world of tribulation, he would carry in
[32:39] a revelation. And because he made this
[32:41] promise, he has to send a prophet to
[32:43] this age. Now, church, it's something in
[32:47] you that made you believe this message
[32:49] when other people don't believe it.
[32:52] There's some reason when you can't
[32:54] understand it, when you don't know how
[32:56] to put it all together, but there's
[32:58] something on the inside of you that
[33:00] knows it's right and you know it's true.
[33:04] And there's something speaks back to
[33:05] you. It's because there's something in
[33:08] you telling you, amen, not to worship
[33:10] the image of that beast. Because God is
[33:13] not causing us to worship under a
[33:15] system. He is an individual under the
[33:18] word of God to worship God as a prophet
[33:22] introduces him to be worshiped. There's
[33:26] only one provided place of worship. Is
[33:29] that right? And that's the place he puts
[33:30] his name. Yeah. Yeah. Now watch the
[33:33] scriptures. I Oh my goodness. Amen. And
[33:36] and and and now in the ninth verse, if
[33:38] any man have an ear, let him hear. And
[33:41] he that leadth captivity shall go into
[33:43] captivity, and he that killth with a
[33:45] sword must be killed with a sword. And
[33:47] here's the patience and the faith of the
[33:48] saints. And I beheld another beast
[33:52] coming out of the earth. So we have a
[33:54] second beast in Revelations 13. The
[33:57] second beast in Revelations 13, let's
[34:00] just say it real clearly. It's America.
[34:02] Yeah. It's the United States of America.
[34:05] I saw another beast coming up out of the
[34:07] earth. See, there's no people here.
[34:09] They're coming up out of the earth. This
[34:11] is a wilderness. Brother Brandham said,
[34:13] "If you want to know what this is," he
[34:15] says, "Go back and read Revelations 12
[34:18] and see that there was a a great uh uh
[34:21] wonder in heaven and a woman clothed
[34:23] with a sun, the moon under the feet, and
[34:24] upon her head a crown of 12 stars, the
[34:27] old church. And she being with child
[34:29] travailing and birth pain to be
[34:30] delivered. There it is. Brother Ram
[34:32] says, "And there was the killing of
[34:34] those two year olds under Jesus." He
[34:36] says, "And then watch and this dragon
[34:38] and behold a red dragon having seven
[34:40] heads and his tail drew a third part."
[34:42] Now we go through the battle. But then
[34:44] in the sixth verse, the Bible said, "The
[34:46] woman fled into the wilderness where she
[34:48] had a place prepared of God that should
[34:50] feed her 1,23 score days." Amen. And
[34:54] this woman fled into the wilderness.
[34:56] Brother Bam said, "Here it is. That's
[34:58] Plymouth Rock." Yeah.
[35:01] That's what he said. He said, "What is
[35:04] it?" He said, "We fled Europe
[35:07] running from the force of the Catholic
[35:10] religion and fled into the wilderness of
[35:13] America." Amen. And all of your
[35:15] historians used to teach, "We came here
[35:17] for freedom of religion." That's why
[35:20] America was founded. It was founded for
[35:23] freedom of religion. Amen. But watch the
[35:26] Bible. It tells us this. Another beast
[35:28] come out of the earth and it had two
[35:30] horns like a lamb, but it spake like a
[35:34] dragon. At first it looked like a lamb
[35:36] and then it spake like a dragon. How
[35:38] many knows what Brother Bram said that
[35:39] was? He said it was the American
[35:41] buffalo. And he said it had two horns.
[35:44] Those horns represent the ecclesiastical
[35:47] power, the church, and the political
[35:50] power. He said, in other words, they
[35:52] have two different powers. But this this
[35:55] that started like a lamb is going to end
[35:57] up like a dragon. Now what did that
[36:00] dragon do? It joins together the church
[36:03] and the state the ecclesiastical joins
[36:05] with the political to bring a force upon
[36:09] the people of God. Watch what it's a
[36:12] powerful thing as we read it. He had two
[36:14] horns like a lamb, but he spake like a
[36:17] dragon.
[36:18] And he exercisth all of the power of the
[36:22] first beast before him, and causeth the
[36:25] earth and them to dwell therein to
[36:27] worship the first beast as whose deadly
[36:30] wound was healed. Now, now this is the
[36:32] reason that that I believe personally
[36:34] that history is such an important thing
[36:36] to us as a church. And I thank God that
[36:38] he recorded these things because we can
[36:41] look back in history and we can see what
[36:43] happened after the Nyian council passed
[36:46] the trinitarian doctrine and the baptism
[36:48] of the father, son, and holy ghost only
[36:51] 60 years after that was passed. They
[36:54] then outlawed any religion besides the
[36:57] Catholic trinitarian religion. So from
[37:00] the time of 380 AD to about 1580, the
[37:03] the the the the the history lessons
[37:06] teach us that 68 million died at the
[37:10] hands of the Roman church because they
[37:13] were heretical Christians. They believed
[37:15] in leadership. They believed the
[37:17] authority come from the Bible and not
[37:19] from a pope. They believed in the
[37:21] supreme deity of Jesus Christ and
[37:24] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:26] Christ. And because of that, they died.
[37:29] Now you say, "Preacher, why what are you
[37:30] saying?" I want you to understand the
[37:32] Bible says that they will exercise the
[37:36] power of the beast that is before them.
[37:38] So whatever you see the beast do to that
[37:42] early Christian, it's going to happen
[37:44] again. It's going to happen in this
[37:46] United States of America. There is going
[37:48] to be a persecution upon this nation and
[37:52] upon the Christians and the
[37:53] undenominational people that are in this
[37:56] world that we're living in. Now, the
[37:57] other day before I started preaching in
[37:59] this area, y'all remember before I went
[38:01] to Switzerland, I preached a sermon
[38:03] called the translation out of the first
[38:05] seal. And I proved to you that that
[38:08] could never happen until the bride has
[38:11] been taken away. Such as Joseph's wife
[38:14] has to be in the palace before he can
[38:16] reveal himself to his brethren. So does
[38:19] the bride have to be in the heavens. Now
[38:21] watch, church. Brother Bam says it's
[38:23] when we leave the earth, it's when the
[38:26] devil comes down to the earth.
[38:29] Now you say, "Preacher, where's he going
[38:31] to go?" I tell you where he's going to
[38:32] go. Brother Bam said, "Watch that
[38:33] nickelan spirit get itself a false
[38:36] prophet or an antichrist who's now
[38:39] holding the door open for the beast."
[38:42] Amen. Now you watch Judas's car. He
[38:44] wasn't the beast the whole time, but
[38:46] right at the last moments, there was a
[38:48] spirit that dropped down in him that
[38:50] made him betray Christ. And right now,
[38:53] that office of the pope is holding the
[38:55] door open for the beast to drop down
[38:58] into a man. Amen. And exercise the power
[39:02] that was exercised in Rome back in the
[39:05] world that we're living in today. You
[39:07] say, "It can't happen, can it?" Amen.
[39:09] How did they kill 6 million Jews just 40
[39:12] or 50 years? Amen. in the in the 1900s.
[39:16] Modern world. It is modern. Brother
[39:18] Wayne, it's a modern world. They would
[39:20] never do it. You tell that six million
[39:22] Jews that went under that holocaust that
[39:24] they won't do it. Yeah, they'll do it
[39:26] because they was anointed with the devil
[39:28] to do it. And the Bible says that the
[39:31] dragon is going to inspire them.
[39:35] My goodness. And they will kill them and
[39:37] think they're doing a favor. and they
[39:40] exercise the power of the first and
[39:43] before him and causeth the earth to
[39:45] dwell therein to worship the beast whose
[39:46] deadly wound was healed. Now this is why
[39:49] you find that you you're watching the
[39:51] gentile kingdom that came in under
[39:53] Daniel is going out the way it come in.
[39:56] How'd it come in? Forced worship.
[39:58] Remember forced worship. That's how it
[40:00] came in. They forced the Hebrew children
[40:03] to worship Daniel. Right. Brother Bam
[40:06] said the image, the holy man image was
[40:08] Daniel. Now watch what he's going to do
[40:11] for us. He's going to show us that
[40:13] they're going to make you want to
[40:15] worship a pope instead of Jesus Christ.
[40:20] We could get it a little closer to our
[40:21] church though, couldn't we? They want
[40:23] you to worship William Brandham instead
[40:25] of Jesus Christ. And they'll force you
[40:28] to do it. Do you know that? Brother Bam
[40:30] says they'll force them to quit
[40:31] preaching the gospel.
[40:35] What force is going on right now in the
[40:37] message?
[40:38] What is it forcing to do right now in
[40:40] the message? Worship, Brother Brandham,
[40:42] and don't preach the gospel no more.
[40:43] Just play a tape. I tell you, it's the
[40:46] same inspiration. That's right. Amen.
[40:49] But we will never bow to the image of
[40:52] the Antichrist system in the church of
[40:54] the living God. I'll tell you, we're
[40:56] going to feel the inspiration of the
[40:57] Holy Spirit. Our authority is the Bible.
[41:01] Come on, church. God has sent a prophet
[41:03] into this land. And that prophet said,
[41:05] "Don't worship me. I am a brother. I am
[41:09] a prophet. I am an eagle, but I am not
[41:12] your God. Worship God. Don't worship
[41:16] me." Do you see what it's going to do?
[41:18] Do you see what's happening? Force
[41:20] worship. You see that spirit even
[41:22] getting around the message? Worship this
[41:24] way. Don't worship that way. You can
[41:25] shout, but you can't dance. And you can
[41:27] dance, but you can't cry. But you can't
[41:29] hug. You can't clap your hands. You
[41:30] can't have good Come on. Force
[41:35] dictating force. Amen. But I I tell you
[41:38] what, I'm a little like them Hebrew
[41:40] children. I'll tell you, oh king. Amen.
[41:42] You can turn that fire as hot as you
[41:44] want, but we will not bend and we will
[41:47] not bow. Amen. Because we are sons and
[41:50] daughters of God. You can take our
[41:52] books. You can take our tapes. You can
[41:54] take everything. But there's a
[41:56] revelation on the inside of this bride
[41:59] that you'll never get out of her. Amen.
[42:01] Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I will build my
[42:04] church and the gates of hell will never
[42:06] prevail against it." Amen. That means
[42:09] two things. This church is built solid.
[42:11] And number two, it means the devil will
[42:14] be against it. But she is built on the
[42:16] solid foundation of the word of God. Oh,
[42:19] church. Come on. The devil's not against
[42:21] you saying Jesus is God right now.
[42:24] That's not what the gates of hell is
[42:25] against. The gates of hell is not out
[42:28] there. Brother B said, "What the gates
[42:29] of hell is against is you believing that
[42:32] deity is in the flesh today."
[42:34] [Applause]
[42:38] Hallelujah.
[42:39] That same Jesus is in his church. That's
[42:42] right.
[42:44] I'll tell you the power of God. It that
[42:46] thing will exercise the power of it. And
[42:48] you'll watch that. You'll watch the
[42:50] influences of that
[42:51] thing. Now, I'm this might get a little
[42:54] straight right here, but you'll watch
[42:55] the influences of it. And brother Bham
[42:57] said, even in the true vine, he said,
[42:59] you're going to watch pastors that
[43:00] believe they have more authority than
[43:03] the local church. He said, so the vine
[43:05] will be spotted by the humanism of one
[43:08] man trying to rule over another.
[43:11] Well, I don't I I have no problem being
[43:14] ruled by this word. But I got a real
[43:16] problem with some pastor or some bishop
[43:18] out there trying to teach us how to
[43:20] worship God or how to address God. Amen.
[43:23] We are under the inspiration of the
[43:25] Almighty.
[43:27] You say you're you're a maverick, by the
[43:29] way. Not not not unless you're talking
[43:31] about man. I'm not I'm not a I'm not
[43:33] coming under a man. I don't let me just
[43:35] say this. I do not recognize any
[43:37] spiritual authority over this church
[43:39] outside of the message of the hour.
[43:45] Now, now that means we are a free bride.
[43:49] That's right. That means we are free to
[43:51] worship God. That means we can we can we
[43:54] can offer God out of the dictates of our
[43:57] hearts.
[43:58] The problem friends that we run into is
[44:00] men get teachings and they know what
[44:02] they know about it. And that's good, but
[44:03] they put a period on the end of it. And
[44:06] brother Bon said, "I'm good with that."
[44:07] He said, "But just put a comma behind it
[44:10] because God might show us a little more
[44:11] on it."
[44:13] And that's what we want is a comma so
[44:15] that God can keep unveiling his word.
[44:18] Amen.
[44:20] Now, saying that, let me say this. If he
[44:22] unveils it, it'll fit in what he's
[44:24] already given.
[44:27] And he exercisth all the power of that
[44:30] beast whose deadly wound was healed. And
[44:32] he doeth great wonders, so that he
[44:33] maketh fire come down from heaven.
[44:35] Hiroshima.
[44:37] Did he do it? Wow. He make fire come
[44:40] down from heaven on the earth and in the
[44:42] sight of man, and deceiveth them that
[44:43] dwell on the earth by the same means of
[44:45] those miracles which had the power to do
[44:47] in the sight of the beast, saying to
[44:49] them that dwell on the earth, that they
[44:50] should make an image to the beast which
[44:53] he had wounded by a sword and did live
[44:56] the image to the beast. How many knows
[44:58] what the image to the beast is? It is
[45:01] the world council of churches. It is
[45:04] Protestant denominations
[45:07] that have followed organizational system
[45:09] to worship God. Yeah. An image to the
[45:13] beast which had the womb by a sword and
[45:16] did live. And he had power to give life
[45:20] unto the image of the beast. And the
[45:22] image of the beast should both speak and
[45:25] cause that as many as would not worship
[45:28] the image of the beast they should be
[45:31] killed. Do you see what he's saying? the
[45:32] exercise the power the 12th verse you
[45:35] see then in here it spells it out
[45:37] plainly if you don't worship it you'll
[45:39] be killed now there's your force
[45:41] religion that's why it's called mystery
[45:43] Babylon it's force religion they would
[45:46] not worship the image of the beast and
[45:47] he causth all both small and great now
[45:51] watch that everybody small and great
[45:54] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[45:59] mark in the right hand or in their
[46:01] forehead now if we had a list of all of
[46:04] the ideas of what this means, wouldn't
[46:07] we have a while to go?
[46:10] It's a real problem. It It is a real
[46:12] problem. But we have the answer.
[46:15] That's right. Now, Brother Man preaches
[46:17] several sermons on it, but let's just
[46:18] make it real clear. The first man ever
[46:21] marked in the Bible was Cain. It was the
[46:24] mark of the beast. What did he do? He
[46:27] rejected the divine revelation of the
[46:30] will of God. and was marked because he
[46:33] slayed his brother. You see, that same
[46:34] spirit from the Garden of Eden is going
[46:37] to mature in the last days. And because
[46:40] that we have our own revelation, God's
[46:42] going to bless this Abel. He's going to
[46:44] bless this bride. But the scripture says
[46:47] that this image of the beast is going to
[46:50] worship or going to kill anyone that
[46:52] wouldn't bow to it and it will cause
[46:54] all. Now, one thing we're finding here
[46:57] is that because of this statement, we
[46:59] see now that they will have the commerce
[47:02] of the world.
[47:04] If you read Revelations the 18th
[47:06] chapter, you'll find the Bible said,
[47:07] "And the merchants of the
[47:10] earth." Everyone does business with this
[47:13] woman. Everyone does business with her.
[47:17] And if you don't worship her, you will
[47:20] receive a mark in the right hand or in
[47:22] their foreheads. Now what is the mark of
[47:25] the beast? It's the mark of
[47:27] apostasy. It is to deny the seal of God.
[47:33] It is to deny the Holy Ghost.
[47:36] It is a spiritual mark. It is not your
[47:39] social security number.
[47:47] News flash.
[47:48] It's not your debit
[47:50] card.
[47:53] Another news flash. It's not Y2K. All
[47:57] right.
[48:00] Come on now. Y'all know I'm telling you
[48:01] the truth.
[48:04] It's not co vaccine.
[48:09] [Applause]
[48:12] I can tell you it's not because I know
[48:14] what it is.
[48:16] If you know what it is, all them other
[48:18] things don't even matter because you
[48:21] know what it is. Now, what is it? The
[48:24] inspiration of the Almighty has breathed
[48:27] upon this bride. What is it? What is
[48:30] that mark of the beast? It is to reject
[48:32] the Holy Ghost. To be marked in your
[48:35] head is the revelation you receive from
[48:38] organization. It's your understanding.
[48:40] You have allowed an organization to be
[48:43] your head and to tell you how to believe
[48:46] this Bible. They have told you there are
[48:48] three gods. When this Bible said, "Hear
[48:50] you, O Israel. The Lord thy God is one
[48:54] God. He is not three gods." Amen. Go
[48:57] baptize in the name of the father, son,
[48:59] and holy ghost. He has a name and his
[49:01] name is Jesus Christ. Do all you do in
[49:05] word and deed and do it in the name of
[49:07] Jesus. Let all the remission of sins be
[49:09] preached in the name of Jesus under
[49:12] heavens. There is no other place to be
[49:14] saved than the name of Jesus. At the
[49:18] name of Jesus, a name is higher than
[49:19] other names. Amen. Let every knee bow.
[49:22] Let every tongue confess that Jesus
[49:25] Christ is our Lord. He is King of Kings.
[49:28] He is Lord of Lords. He is not the
[49:30] second person of a
[49:33] Godhead. He is God and there is no
[49:35] other. He said, "All power in heaven and
[49:38] earth is given unto me." There is one
[49:40] mediator between God and man. It is the
[49:43] man Christ Jesus. It's not William
[49:46] Brandom. It's not a pope of Rome. It's
[49:49] not the World Council of Churches. It is
[49:51] Jesus Christ.
[49:54] The son of God.
[49:57] Hallelujah.
[50:00] It's the way you understand the word.
[50:03] What is your head, right?
[50:07] I could spend a long time here, but I'm
[50:09] going to just say it. I'm just going to
[50:10] say it instead of teaching. Is that all
[50:11] right?
[50:13] Your right hand represents your
[50:16] fellowship
[50:17] and the will of the church. A right hand
[50:21] of fellowship means you're operating
[50:22] according to their will and the way they
[50:25] want to do things.
[50:27] You're operating what what they want out
[50:29] of you. The right hand of fellowship and
[50:33] the revelation. It's a spiritual mark.
[50:35] that is put upon them who deny the truth
[50:39] of God's word. And without it, you can't
[50:41] buy or sell. They that had the mark of
[50:44] that name of the beast or the number of
[50:45] his
[50:46] name. Now, here is wisdom. Now, watch
[50:49] the book of Daniel. Here's wisdom.
[50:51] Inspiration of the Almighty, here is the
[50:54] inspiration. Let him that hath
[50:56] understanding. Who is this scripture
[50:58] talking to? Let him that hath
[51:01] understand. Do you know William Brandham
[51:03] said this is to that little last day
[51:05] people?
[51:07] Yeah. He actually details when it says
[51:11] let him that hath understanding. He's
[51:14] speaking to the end time church that is
[51:18] supposed to have the spirit of wisdom.
[51:21] He said let him that have wisdom count
[51:23] the number of the beast for it is the
[51:24] number of a man and his number is 600
[51:28] three score and six. That is 666.
[51:32] Now, amen. Just so happens I brought
[51:35] some preachers with me tonight. All
[51:36] right. You know, William Brandom,
[51:38] brother Brandham, a prophet of God, a
[51:41] vindicated prophet.
[51:43] And we know he's a prophet because he
[51:45] always told us to worship God, right?
[51:48] That prophet told us a beautiful story
[51:50] and a and a beautiful testament that
[51:53] this name that is written here the
[51:57] number of his beast. He said do you know
[52:00] that the vicarious filidi that is day
[52:03] that is written in Rome concerning the
[52:06] pope in its Latin numerals spells the
[52:11] numerology 6
[52:14] 66.
[52:16] Now, now there's there's some real
[52:19] criticism to this fact. If you if you're
[52:22] a a studyer, you've probably ran into
[52:23] the criticisms of it. But I have found
[52:27] some people had rather joined the side
[52:29] of the Catholic Church has agreed with
[52:30] brother Brandham.
[52:33] Seriously, go ahead. Somebody said,
[52:35] "Brother Brandon never saw it because it
[52:37] wasn't there." I laughed. I said,
[52:39] "Really?" So, I I'm you know, I'm sorry,
[52:42] but I I'm just that guy. So I go on a
[52:45] study. Do you know that the Catholic
[52:48] Church
[52:49] itself actually uses the title vicarious
[52:53] filod day as the title of the pope of
[52:57] Rome.
[52:59] Now they've actually at this time that
[53:02] we're standing have hid the outward
[53:06] information that you can find that in.
[53:08] Now y'all wouldn't believe conspiracy
[53:10] and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but
[53:12] I'm going to tell you they did it.
[53:14] There are
[53:15] documented people that have signed
[53:19] affidavits that spent four to five years
[53:21] in the Vatican that laid their eyes on
[53:26] the triple crown that had the entitled
[53:29] words vicarious filia day written right
[53:33] in it. Now, one one writer he he's
[53:35] recording it and he said that we always
[53:38] wrote it vicarious filia day. He said,
[53:41] "We wrote it this way because that some
[53:44] sometimes it's it's printed that way."
[53:46] He said, "But I was talking to this man
[53:48] that was over there in Rome who was
[53:50] studying to be a pope or a a priest."
[53:53] And he said, "You got it wrong." He
[53:55] said, "What do you mean you got it
[53:56] wrong?" He said, "Well," he said,
[53:58] "because it's written not on the tiara
[54:01] like the little plain uh funny looking
[54:03] uh Burger King hat they wear, but but
[54:06] they have another hat they wear and it's
[54:08] called the Triple Crown, right? Give me
[54:11] the picture of that triple crown. It's
[54:13] called the triple crown. Now, if you've
[54:15] ever seen this, this is the triple
[54:16] crown. This is one. There was many of
[54:18] them, but this is one of them. And this
[54:20] is one of them. As brother Bam describes
[54:22] that the pope wears a triple crown. Now,
[54:25] it it stands for heavens, earth, and
[54:28] beneath the earth. It means he's supreme
[54:30] ruler. It's like uh it's like if you won
[54:33] the Kentucky Derby and you won uh the uh
[54:36] three more different big races, they
[54:38] triple crown a horse. He's the winner of
[54:40] all them big races. Well, they triple
[54:41] crown the pope because he's supposed to
[54:44] be in thestead of Christ vicarious filia
[54:47] day in thestead of the son of God. He's
[54:50] supposed to be filling the second person
[54:51] of the godhead. Not that he represents
[54:54] Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ in
[54:57] the veil.
[54:59] And that's why supreme authority is
[55:02] given to this man. And when they put
[55:04] this on his head, do you know the words
[55:06] they say when they dawn this thing on
[55:08] the head of a pope? When they crown him
[55:10] like they did today, when they crown a
[55:12] pope, they say vicarious filia day.
[55:15] Speaking in thestead of the son of God.
[55:18] In other words, there is human
[55:20] representation of God on the earth in
[55:23] his son which is now a pope. Now, I know
[55:27] you didn't come here for Catholic
[55:28] doctrine and teaching, but you see the
[55:31] three different crowns, a word on each
[55:33] one of those crowns. In this one,
[55:34] there's only two words. Amen. And they
[55:36] deny there's any on any of them, but if
[55:38] you look at them lab kind of like a
[55:40] little dog label, you can see it. A blue
[55:42] one on the bottom, a bronze one on the
[55:43] second one, and there's actually a third
[55:45] one in the one Brother Brandham saw,
[55:47] Vicarious Philly Day. Now, there's
[55:49] actually several different uh there's
[55:52] several different people that have saw
[55:53] this and recorded this. Amen. Give me
[55:56] that uh give me that uh grant uh from
[55:58] Constantine. I sent you just it's a
[56:00] funny looking picture. It's the Grant of
[56:02] Constantine. The first time it's
[56:04] recorded, this statement is recorded,
[56:06] it's recorded and this picture is drawn.
[56:08] They did good pictures back in the day
[56:10] cuz people didn't read much. Y'all know
[56:11] that back in the 1400s and and and they
[56:14] they really didn't read much. So they
[56:15] put it all in art. And this is a picture
[56:19] and this is Constantine handing the
[56:21] Roman kingdom to the Pope.
[56:24] And this is called Amen. Uh it's the uh
[56:27] it's the gift of Constantine. Amen. But
[56:30] it's the first time vicarious file day
[56:32] ends up in literature is when he is when
[56:35] he hands this kingdom to the pope. Amen.
[56:39] Now, now what's fire now? They say it's
[56:41] fords now, but whatever. Amen. But what
[56:43] we've what we're seeing is is that
[56:45] you're seeing vicarious filia come in
[56:47] there. Give me that next one that breaks
[56:49] that down for you. Amen. Now, here it is
[56:52] right here. and said the title of pope
[56:54] of Rome is vicarious filia day Latin for
[56:57] the viker the son of god and it's
[56:59] inscribed on his matter which I showed
[57:01] you the triple crown and if you take the
[57:03] letters of the title and lmen numerals
[57:05] there it is right there and you can add
[57:07] them up is
[57:09] 666 and it's an obviously correct now
[57:12] the connection is anything but new now
[57:15] this was given here amen so that you and
[57:18] I we got a little bit of history to tell
[57:20] us that they've been calling this guy
[57:23] vicariously. He died all these years.
[57:25] But then when brother Random shows up,
[57:27] amen, he picks these things up and
[57:30] brings them into modern history to tell
[57:32] you and I, amen, that this pope is
[57:35] taking the place of the son of God. Now,
[57:38] watch what's going to happen. This this
[57:40] system that we're living in today, this
[57:42] America under its denominations. Amen.
[57:46] Now, I got to slow down just a second.
[57:49] Do y'all realize there was no
[57:52] denominational churches until after
[57:55] Martin Luther? That's right. How many
[57:57] knows that?
[58:00] From the time of Christ all the way to
[58:03] the Reformation of Martin Luther, what
[58:04] is that 1580s or something? All the way
[58:07] to the 1580s, there is no Seventh Day
[58:10] Adventist. There's no Lutheran, no
[58:12] Presbyterian, no Pentecost. There's no
[58:14] There's the Roman Catholic Church. Yeah.
[58:17] And the heretics. Right.
[58:20] But after the reformation of Martin
[58:22] Luther, he Amen. When he be to die, they
[58:25] begin to birth
[58:27] organizations and the prophet of God
[58:29] said, "Watch now those organizations
[58:31] birth and there is the daughters to that
[58:34] great whore." Amen. And she will form an
[58:37] image of the beast. Now, the world
[58:39] council wouldn't become Catholicism, but
[58:43] they made their own system just like it.
[58:48] Yeah. But William Brandham makes a great
[58:50] prediction. Can I get that quote?
[58:52] Brother Brandham makes a great
[58:54] prediction here out of Revelations 13.
[58:56] He said, "I believe one of these
[58:57] glorious days when this United
[59:01] Confederation of Church goes together
[59:03] and the new pope is brought out of the
[59:05] United States."
[59:10] And the new pope Oh, will be brought out
[59:14] of the United States. I guess believe
[59:17] the sign folks don't want to talk about
[59:18] this one.
[59:21] And the new pope is brought out of the
[59:23] United States. What is that? 541219.
[59:27] I guess he said that after the new pope
[59:29] came, you know, and he arranged things.
[59:33] Every commentator of the world said
[59:35] there's never been a pope come out of
[59:36] America. It's a superpower. We doubt
[59:38] there will ever be a pope out of
[59:40] America. But in 1954, Brother Bram said,
[59:43] "When he comes out of America,
[59:45] and put over there according to
[59:47] prophecy,
[59:49] then they'll form an image like an under
[59:51] the beast." And I tell you, the true
[59:52] church of God will be drove together
[59:55] 1954, 1219. Give me the a little bit of
[59:58] information on this new pope. The new
[1:00:00] pope, Pope Leo, was born on September
[1:00:03] the 14th, 1955. That's the ninth. Turn
[1:00:07] that back to that other quote.
[1:00:10] Wow. December of 54. Go to the next one.
[1:00:13] Wow. And nine months later, September
[1:00:18] 1955 is the first American pope in
[1:00:20] history from Chicago, Illinois. You say,
[1:00:24] "Preacher, is he the one?" I don't know.
[1:00:26] But he's the first one from America. And
[1:00:28] I'll say this. Amen. We have been
[1:00:30] waiting
[1:00:32] for a pope to come from America a long
[1:00:35] time. Just like we were waiting for that
[1:00:37] woman to be sworn sworn in in a purple
[1:00:39] robe. And remember when it happened and
[1:00:41] we said, "Hey, she's been sworn in."
[1:00:43] Everybody goes, "Well, that can't be the
[1:00:44] one." Amen. I I tell you what, I believe
[1:00:46] the Roman church done took America over
[1:00:50] done took America over, church. She's
[1:00:52] got the Supreme Court. Amen. Our vice
[1:00:54] president, she's got most of the cabinet
[1:00:56] of America is already roaming it. Right.
[1:01:02] But when we seen that woman in purple
[1:01:04] swearing in, it was a natural symbol to
[1:01:08] something that has already taken place
[1:01:10] in America. Come on, church. Brother Bam
[1:01:12] said, "Watch the Bible." It said, "They
[1:01:14] will be blind, miserable, and naked."
[1:01:16] Right? The church in the last days will
[1:01:19] be naked. But we see a natural symbol.
[1:01:21] The women in the world are actually
[1:01:24] naked,
[1:01:25] representing what's happened in the
[1:01:27] church. And when this American pope,
[1:01:30] watch it, it's turned towards
[1:01:31] Catholicism, folks. We are living in the
[1:01:34] last moments of the last hours of the
[1:01:37] last days. Amen. I say desperation are
[1:01:40] to strike our heart and say, "God, I
[1:01:42] want to reorder my words. I want to
[1:01:45] reorder my steps. I want to remember you
[1:01:48] said there's going to be a rapture.
[1:01:49] There's going to be a bride. Lord, I
[1:01:51] want to go. I want to be caught up with
[1:01:53] you."
[1:01:54] Oh, church of the living God. I believe
[1:01:56] we're living in the last moments.
[1:01:59] Yes, sir. Of the last days. Won't you
[1:02:01] stand to your feet with us tonight? I
[1:02:03] certainly believe I certainly believe
[1:02:05] that God Amen is doing something
[1:02:08] wonderful in our generation.
[1:02:11] I'm not quite done, but I'm done. Can
[1:02:14] our musicians come? Do you see,
[1:02:19] friends? Let me It says it again.
[1:02:24] This message is true.
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:33] They said, "Well, brother Brandham never
[1:02:35] saw that vicarious Philly day." And I
[1:02:37] got to studying and there are men that
[1:02:40] made legal
[1:02:43] affidavits that they were standing there
[1:02:45] and saw it themselves.
[1:02:48] Now, if people can't go find it, that's
[1:02:50] all right. But you know, nobody ever
[1:02:51] looked that other guy up and said,
[1:02:52] "Well, he lied about that."
[1:02:55] But because it was a prophet, the old
[1:02:58] devil's working on every corner trying
[1:03:00] to undermine him.
[1:03:02] He told us the truth, folks.
[1:03:06] That's true. History,
[1:03:09] Bible, Yeah. current current events,
[1:03:14] right? It all spells one thing.
[1:03:17] We have the truth.
[1:03:20] This is true. Young people,
[1:03:25] this is true. That's right.
[1:03:28] When I was a little boy, not much more
[1:03:30] than eight or nine years old, I'll never
[1:03:32] forget it all of my life, my dad, my
[1:03:36] mom, the
[1:03:37] preachers, someday there'll be a pope
[1:03:40] come out of
[1:03:41] America. Someday there'll be a pope come
[1:03:44] out of America.
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:50] I tell you what, it's a shocking
[1:03:53] feeling.
[1:03:58] Now, for me
[1:03:59] personally, the timing, but I'm studying
[1:04:03] these things. I'm reading these things.
[1:04:05] I'm digging through these things. And
[1:04:07] then
[1:04:09] they put an American pope in. Wow.
[1:04:13] Praise God. Oh, brother. What a time
[1:04:16] we're living.
[1:04:19] It's time to It's time, folks. You know,
[1:04:22] Brother Brandham says
[1:04:24] it. He says, "If you think the master
[1:04:26] delayeth his
[1:04:27] coming," he said, "if you get your
[1:04:29] mind." He said, "People will do almost
[1:04:31] anything." Yes, sir.
[1:04:34] But when it becomes real to you,
[1:04:38] you reenter your life.
[1:04:40] You refocus your heart.
[1:04:44] I tell you, I believe it's a time
[1:04:46] I believe it's the time to reenter our
[1:04:48] hearts on the word of life.
[1:04:51] Let our confessions be reordered
[1:04:55] under the inspiration of the Almighty in
[1:04:57] his presence. Do you love him tonight?
[1:04:59] Amen. Amen. Brother Ben in
[1:05:05] my
[1:05:07] life.
[1:05:09] Lord be
[1:05:14] glorified. Be Be
[1:05:19] glorified
[1:05:21] in
[1:05:23] my
[1:05:26] life.

[1:05:33] glorified today.
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:39] Oh, in
[1:05:43] my
[1:05:45] life.

[1:05:53] glorified. Be
[1:05:57] glorified
