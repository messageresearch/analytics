have stood I told Brother Wayne as I hug he's the greatest preacher I know man and so I don't know why you know these are the big guns I'm the peashooter so I I just you know when I was a kid you know you had five extra cents you went to the in dim store and you got that little straw that get you to pee out that's what I feel like so but I love you I love you dearly you've enriched my lives over the years I think of you often I thank God for you I thank God for you you mean a lot to me and so God bless you the song was wonderful this morning from the from the young people and um um how can I say this nicely you think I'm going to say something bad or something right I thought it was a beautiful song but I have a I have a problem man I'm letting it all out this morning aren't I weird problem you know I I I I changeed S I change words and scks because for me and I would love if if the Lord would have it for the young people to sing that again but I wrote it down I wrote it down it's not that that's the pray cloth I did write it down yes I did just how good he is just how good he is that's a great line but you Sayang how unworthy I am well I'm going to preach on your worthiness so the only change I would say would take the UN off amow because I'm going to take a quote from your Prophet it says and he's the one that's called you worthy I thought how how wonderful how wonderful and I I and I wouldn't I'm not doing that I would never want to hurt anyone of you please I'm not saying that I just know that you know Through the Ages right and the Catholic church and everything you're just unworthy we are okay it's like I've said many times before get over that you'll never be worthy but when he calls you worthy that's when you change your whole attitude I'm not going to let the devil let you go and say I'm Just So Unworthy I'm So Unworthy no no we're going to get into it this morning you you are the worthy ones H okay I know some of you are just saying I'm going to wait and see but by the grace of God by the grace of God and the Lord's help we'll look to the word of God pise the Lord God bless you all and and I'm sorry sometimes I get pulled to this over the ministers are pulling and then all of a sudden I get pulled over here and here and here and you see me walk walking all over this place brother Murphy Wong at home he's one of our precious ministers you know I I don't know what what it is but all of us seem to use the platform but Murphy Brother Murphy and um we've had the same carpet I was saying to the Saints the other day for for since 1989 since we opened the church and it looks brand new it looks fantastic except where Murphy stands because we are all over the place and Murphy he's just standing there but he just shuffles like this and I look down there's only two patches on the whole platform so we move because we don't want to put new carpet in yeah well God bless you and I'm just relaxing myself sorry if I'm it's all right well if you have your Bibles please turn to Proverbs 11 Proverbs 11 and we will be reading at verse one Proverbs 11 verse 1 a false balance is an Abomination to the Lord but a just weight is his Delight when Pride cometh then cometh shame of with lowly is wisdom the Integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them riches profit not in the day of Wrath but righteousness deliver from death the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness like to read verse one one more time please a false balance is an Abomination to the Lord but a just weight is his Delight let's pray one more time heavenly father as we look around the room and see the redeemed of God it moves our hearts Lord these precious brothers that work in the back lord in the sound I just pray Lord that you will bless those that labor for the kingdom in what area whatever area you have them as the pastor was saying this morning great gifts are in the body Lord those gifts are not for themselves but the gifts are for the body so I pray that your blessing be upon the church and upon the word as we commit ourselves to you now in Jesus name amen amen you may have your seats now you might this morning have to um um I will go slow and like brother Ron Spencer said one time he heard me at home I was preaching and he was listening to me and he text me after all I he I said I'm going to go slow this morning and he text me he says well let's see how that [Laughter] goes so we're all different and that's what makes the great B of God beautiful every one of you have have are something special to the Lord and each one has a part to play in the great body of Christ and so I I thought well I I just came across this the other day and I and I and I thought this might might help understand word the kind of day we're living in it's it's called and the title is facts in case you miss them facts in case you missed them according to research our attention span has markedly decreased in 15 years in 2000 it was 12 seconds 12 seconds you say I know I listen to brother uh brother Dwayne I know I listen to him real good but after 12 seconds shopping I'm not saying you do that at all not this church huh oh I got to fix my car or I got it doesn't matter it doesn't matter but this is fact this is data we're we're proving we're going to prove their data wrong okay I'm doing this to help you help me amen stay focused in 2000 it was 12 seconds now 15 years later it is shrunk to 8.25 seconds wow so these are this is not you know Tom Ray making up some facts this is data that they are collecting in fact scientists reckoned we now have a shorter attention span than goldfish it's amazing isn't it but I'm I'm saying this not to put a cloud or anything on us but the message came or the word has come to focus us so the stats that they give is not us am okay because I know when the preacher preaches at our church whether it be any other brother preaching behind the pulpit I know I got a more attention spend in 8.25 seconds I can prove that wrong but the way Society is moving in their uh how can I say in their entertainment the way the news flash comes it is trying to dictate the minds of those that are of Satan's Eden but God in his greatness sent you Malachi 4 to give you the very Mind Of God that focuses on thus saith the Lord is everybody with me on the same page I don't care what science says I'll take what the word says amen I come to church to meet with Jesus Christ I come to hear from his word and I do not have the attention span of a goldfish amen it goes on this is where marketers have a problem I who the the old days I have to admit I came out of the world so you know um I grew up unfortunately with a television but it used to be they put the ads on and you could go out make a sandwich come back sit down have your Coke and now the thing goes on back to the football game right that's right they can't do that anymore it's got to be changing it's got to keep their attention span right and they said what's happening to our children is that in in their transactions in entertainment they have to change a scene up to every five seconds and that has become now scrambled egg mines you say honey listen listen to Daddy he can't because the programs the way that Society is is bringing the people is to keep them unfocused and it it it it it's a time where we need to saturate ourselves in the word saturate ourselves so now who we who we use tapes who knows when I say tapes what tapes are okay that's pretty good already I said tapes the other day at a group of people and they looked at me like I was from the Dark Ages we don't use tapes anymore well well I guess that's a vacular now how do what are we supposed to say now USB no we don't even use USB anymore right so I I don't know whatever medium you do but we need to saturate ourselves with thus sayeth the Lord amen we used to we used to have a tape and tape used to be 120 right brother Ray used to be a one C 120 and sometimes extra long tape it' be a c120 with a C60 that's 180 minutes that's a three-hour tape and that and that was normal that was normal you sat down and and that's what you listened and and you know some and I always look at people you know I look at you Dory but sometimes I look at you and I know you're not looking back at me you're looking over my head and you're somewhere else but it's not that we are to engage you or entertain you let's put it that way we are here to preach the word of God to let you know exactly who you are um is there anybody here named Henry is there a Henry a George Mike okay there we go we got a couple mics all right they say the sweetest words to a person is their name hi Mike hi Mike right so that's because you know if I walk up to you say hi brother don't you know my name well we use the you know catchall phrase brother sister but the sweeter thing is to say hi brother Ray how are you doing today well the sweeter thing is rather than call you Church yeah the sweeter thing is to call you a bride and so I I feel it a great honor to preach to you as the Bride of Jesus Christ and and and don't you ever let the devil tell you you're anything different than what he's already called you you're the bride the elected chosen of God brother Bram says here in s we would see Jesus he said there's one to be called out the elected church that's showing the sign that God's in flesh okay in corner we good everybody back there God in flesh church amen God in flesh God in flesh Jesus was God in flesh Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight let's say this morning if Jesus is in you this morning listen to what he says it's still God manifesting himself in the last days the son of man is revealing himself in the church H hallelujah hallelujah that should have got you to your feet MH the son of man is being manifested in you the church you say well William Brandon was a son of man well what's he saying the son of man the son of man because he said I am a son of man revealing the son of man now the prophets turning it around and saying that son of man is now in your flesh Glory see you've already proved the devil wrong you're not a goldfish huh praise the Lord listen to him and if Jesus is in you yes he is come on let let's just show the devil you say well what do you always have your hand up that just lets the devil know whose side I'm on and brother Bram said you lifting your hand there you know that's a supernatural act he said God s hand go up amen I want the Lord to know my hand goes up it's To His Glory Hallelujah and Jesus is in you Jesus in you today is God manifesting himself in the last days the son of man is revealing himself in his church human flesh listen that's why I want to get this worthy yeah amen worthy how could God be in you and you be unworthy come on we're just going to knock this one real chop this tree down real good let's root it up God's in you and he's the worthy one then if he's the worthy one and you are also now revealing the son of man then that word worthy one has called you worthy never ever let the devil tell you you're unworthy there should have been a better amen Amen on that one it should have been a little bit louder Hallelujah why cuz the devil told you this morning you're not worthy why you going to church I'll let you know why I'm going to church the word loves the word that's why I come to church I want to hear the word hallelujah that's why he says you're you're feeding on the body word of the son of man it's the word wanting to

join and I married and I'm I'm at I'm Duty on the back door brother Brian and I used to come in from the outside into the lobby and this fellow was com they somebody brother had come in and said this Fell's coming into our church Church she looks a little wild he says maybe you want to meet him I said okay I'll do that you know I'm just young Deacon and sure enough he's foaming at the mouth he say I'm coming to your church I said not my church said I'm coming in there I said no you're not coming in there he said I'm coming in and he starts to move up his sleeves he said I'm going to punch you right in the face I go whoa I didn't know that this came with deaconship honestly I didn't know I'm just knew I I believe the word I mean I said I bind you Satan that guy flipped around walked right back out to the parking lot and left and I said it works and from that time saints of God I started to realize I've got the life of God in Me you've got the life of God in you yes sir come [Music] on oh I love to see a church triumphant we are the church triumphant Hallelujah can you turn with me to Revelation chap 11 get to our subject Revelation 11:1 15 Revelation 11 I as I wrote it my notes out I got Glory beside this Glory Glory Revelation 11:15 the Bible says and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of Our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever do I hear a Glory Hallelujah what a word what a prophecy what a reality Amen brother Bram says this in three Witnesses he says there over in Revelation it said Rejoice ye heavens and you holy prophets for the kingdom of this world world has become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and as long as they are controlled by Satan they got the satanic thoughts and Powers they'll fight until Jesus comes but there will be a stone hued out of a mountain without hands that'll break these kingdoms into pieces and there'll come a kingdom out of there Hallelujah and I'm glad tonight I'm a candidate of that Kingdom why don't you say this morning I'm happy this morning that I am a candidate of that Kingdom because there's been a rock coming this generation strike the image grinds it to powder come on and we are a part of that new kingdom thy kingdom come thy will be done in [Applause] earth hallelujah hallelujah glory be to Jesus let the Hallelujah roll brother Dallas we believe it we're a part of it we're born into it we were always in it Hallelujah so I like the title we finally get to the title been too good to me I told Brother Ray last night he said I feel like so much at home I act like I'm at home you're very gracious and thank you for making me be me in the message Oneness he says that you would study it prayerfully carefully weigh it out so I'd like to title this my little message let me be weighed in even balances because an unbalanced scale is an Abomination so I want to be balanced on a balanced scale you with me amen so let me be weighed in an even balance so that I could be weighed not on the scales of humanity but on the scales of God if we wait ourselves on the scales of leoda they would they would say you're crazy but you get weighed on God's scales you're going to find out you're C worthy worthy Worthy is the Lamb and the worthy lamb has called you the worthy [Music] prde I'm so happy my wife didn't get up this morning said honey I'm So Unworthy to be your your wife oh amen I go honey what's wrong what's wrong here it'd be strange wouldn't it huh you brothers that are married your wives come up to you and say honey I'm So Unworthy how did you choose me I mean there were so many other more beautiful women you're the only one from me you stepped out of Eternity into time I stepped out of Eternity into time God put us together and we're going back to eternity together and so we want to take Satan's scales and boot them out the door what Satan thinks about you who cares what your schoolmates think about you who cares what your fellow employees say about you who cares what God thinks of you that's what I [Applause] care I get scared scared even when people start saying you're a nice fell I have to take it from where it comes from when it's not a Believer I always say what do you want or what is on your agenda you've never called me a nice guy before but we should be in the habit of calling one another amen that you should study it prayerfully carefully weigh it out in the balance of God's word and see whether it be of God or not for I believe that that's the way we should always weigh things with the word but that's why we started with now she is him right she is revealing the son of man so we want to get you on the scales real quickly we don't want the devil start playing with your mind he's a liar and the truth can't be found in him so whatever he tells you rejoice cuz he's never going to tell you the truth I know you you'll get that tomorrow morning yeah amen the devil says Devil's never going to call you a believer come on the devil's never going to call you a Believer but but he will call you an unbeliever so Rejoice because he can't tell the truth so the truth of the matter is you're a Believer Hallelujah you see that's reverse psychology no it's not it's the truth it's just true so just weigh it out amen you know when somebody says something to you you know like you know brother you should buy this truck really I wasn't even thinking about it but why do you want me to buy your truck well he needs money probably and he thinks that you have that extra dollars to do that so in decision making you weigh it out yeah amen when you guys go to school I don't mean you guys I sorry you young men go to school right you come to a place where you got to make decisions what subject you're going to take you got to weigh it out I I and I couldn't even understand in my own thought pattern what on Earth Tom Ray what were you doing going to high school and taking chem2 physics math 12 I'm not a scientist and I was rocking my brains and I had to get a certain average to get into University and I thought this is craziness but now they don't do that sort of stuff but why didn't I weigh it out yeah amen well that's not not what I'm going to be I'm going to be a a businessman or I didn't know I was going to be a preacher and so you know you're young men and you you weigh out what what's your direction or young ladies you know we have young ladies in the church they say but Tom we're going we're graduated what do we do and we all we sit down we talk with sister Joanne and we say well do something that will help your home do something to help your home be a good accountant or something books need to be balanced not that your books aren't balanced but now Joanne she's a nurse never nursed in her life day she married me day she quit nursing she never never had to she graduated and came to my home my home our home but there's things you just got to weigh out in life why do I have this sickness weigh it out I don't need this sickness yeah amen the word says I am the Lord God that Health some of thy diseases ah Church taught well huh I'm the Lord God that Health how many believe that I believe sure you do ask anything in my name people want you see there's there know brother way like I said you just correct me when every when I'm gone you just say so we understand there's healings and there's Miracles right right a miracle happens right now but that's what we're expecting and many times it's God A Healer and that's the process and you walk into your healing by his stripes I am healed and wake up two days later say hey where'd that back problem go go ahead Hallelujah hey I've been there done done and got the badge you got to confess with your lips way it out come on confess with your lips because brother Bram said your body must come subject to your confession and the high priest can't move until you confess it it's not I'm Healed right it's not mind over matter it's speak the word amen by his stripes I'm Healed how you feeling today honey by his stripes I'm Healed how you feel it's not by feelings amen it's by [Applause] faith amen faith is the substance Isaiah 591 says behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither is his ear ear heavy that it cannot hear verse two but your iniquities have separated you and your God and your sins has hid his face from you that he will not hear so there's your unbalanced scale you were born in sin shapen in iniquity amen you came into the world speaking lies amen but God hates an imbalanced scale so God is going to come into your life doesn't matter who the preacher is amen if you're a seed of God he's going to bring that unbalanced scale balanced how many of you went to a Baptist Church hey I put on my hand how many went to a Pentecostal church I'll put up my hand but I tried them all I tried them all man when I was in university I that was my it seemed to be my a game game thing to do try this because I was looking for God yeah looking for God but always in the back of my mind there were three little ladies that lived the word wow and I knew God was somewhere and then my best friend get saved by Joanne's oldest sister God used her to bring her to Bible Way house and brother Ken who was like me all of a sudden started to walk like this I said what happened to you first thing comes out of his his lips Tom you got to get saved got to weigh it out his mommy and daddy didn't like him anymore his family didn't like him anymore so one day I get saved I found out my mommy and daddy didn't like me anymore my brothers and sisters didn't like me anymore but Jesus liked me Hallelujah I accepted I don't care about their acceptance but when I met Jesus I found out I was accepted in the Beloved and that's all that matters Saints I walked alone they didn't want to walk with me they didn't want to talk with me but I got one that walked with me and talked with me and balanced out my life amen Hallelujah the Lord Praise His holy name other if you want to turn to Romans chap 5: 10 put up whenever you're done just put up your arm and say the white flag of surrenderance is here because we got all day right Sunday I say that at home and I get about as many amens so I everybody that said amen go on this side and all the rest can be dismissed you know listen this is what I often say okay if they can enjoy a baseball game shouldn't we enjoy the greatest thing that God could give mankind you know we're the guys that get starchy yeah huh I wonder how much starch was in the upper room they didn't have a nice suit on like I got huh but they waited that one day after 10 days Peter do you think we got it I don't know do you think we got it I don't know he said when Holy Ghost comes when are we going to get when they got it they knew they got it then they went busting out of the room come on and all Jerusalem [Applause] heard but we go to we go and we don't tell nobody because we're refined brother in the good time praise His name in The Marketplace do the same amen I'm not a songwriter but it makes sense doesn't it well I weld and that welding scene no Saints what we are here we are out there we don't put on church we come through the doors oh boy you know brother you're expecting brother Isaac to be that fine looking young man that he is but in the world man he's got holy jeans and flipflops and you know muscle shirts and I better wear long sleeves I don't want see my tatties what we are here we're out there while we're out there we are here amen I get it all the time get it whether it be at a check coat get it at a restaurant we'll be out with the fellas and having lunch they say why are you know you guys aren't even drinking and you're so [Music] happy in fact one lady said at one place what are you guys drinking under the table no I said we're enjoying one another we're enjoying the presence of God what was preached on Sunday what was preached last Wednesday what God's doing in our lives prise the Lord isn't that great that's why we have fellowship with one another we have our doors open to one another we share with one another Mak the church strong we're not just a place on the Pew now I'm getting over to huh Fellowship Divine it's not just the church am oh my did you get the Romans sir I know you're dying for me to get there I got 10 more pages than we're on the first half of the first page Romans 5 and: 10 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son really want I want you to take a look at that word reconcile reconciled means you were imbalanced yeah amen but the only thing that could balance you was blood come on blood not the blood of 2,000 years ago no sir the bleeding word today is what's going to balance you and I to make make us equal amen how important is the message somebody should shell out very important extremely absolutely when the Prophet says in the token message this message is Christ that means this message is the word hallelujah for then if we were enemies well when we were enemies the Bible goes on to say we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life so for when we were enemies there had to be then something we were an enemy so there had to be somebody to give us peace because if you're enemy you're not in peace so there had to be someone to give you peace again with God because you were always Gods yes sir you were always in the mind of God but through the fall you had to come through this progression right so now something had to happen to make you equal or reconcile or on the same plane or on the same balance and that had to be his word his word amen so you got to walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from some sin oh good I caught you no you didn't cuz you're BL Bible Believers right yes sir amen so what does the blood of Jesus Christ do cleanses you from what all s Oh My My My now we want to move it from here to here yes sir okay let's move it from here to here let's speak it from our heart yeah amen from all what now say a little louder now all see if you say it more than once or twice it almost become a habit yeah they say if you do something for three months it becomes a habit let's start your habit today that was Luther is one of his favorite scripture one night he was writing out he was translating a Bible and uh the Devil comes to him walking in his room can you imagine how the devil did that walk right in his room and he said Luther I got a bunch of things against you you did this this week and this this this week and this last week and this and he read out a whole list laundry list and then finally Luther said is that all he says no by the way you did this this this and this this this also he says is that all he says yep that's pretty much it he says he threw brother I I a couple accounts he threw the Inkwell at him and say get out of here devil because the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me from all all your accusations hallelujah thank you Lord if we could catch that one scripture You' be the most liberated [Applause] people wake up in the morning free from guilt and sin hallelujah hallelujah I don't care if my wife burnt my toast you know honey how I like my toast this egg is not it's solid egg I'm just trying to help you along so we're being reconciled that mean God is Rec what you lacked yeah he is now going to to give you what you lacked so that you could be reconciled and be on the same plane amen so the only thing he could give you was his amen was his what word my my and the word comes to his thank you so God had to have a prophet for the word to come to reconcile you so that's why you see churches churches churches all unbalanced they can't live right act right speak right dress right they're imbalanced but when the word came you could walk right talk right speak right act right live right cuz God's reconciled you and now you're no longer an enemy you're at peace with God hallelujah so you've exchanged your sin for the blood oh if you haven't done it this morning you can do it right now you can throw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness right now oh the blood of Jesus Precious Blood of Jesus thank Hallelujah exchange your sin yeah for sinlessness exchange your sin for Peace So then to be reconciled means you've exchanged one thing for another yeah amen it's the word used is to describe actually the exchange of coins to be of equal worth yeah amen see I'm trying to get you down the road righten because I want to show you a year of equal worth yeah amen so then to be reconciled goes back into the Greek and the Greek then lets you know to say to be reconciled is an exchanging of coins to come to the equal value of what's purchased amen all right so can I give you the Greek now that we're Greek Scholars from last night I gave you one word and think you're a Greek scholar I'll give you two and you'll have a PhD calaso calaso meant to legally reconcile two disputing parties so what it's making reference to is a court because it's a legal statement so in the court of God it's meant to reconcile two disputing parties amen the judge became my attorney amen hallelujah and he said you're not guilty Brother Ray it's a rigged court amen for the redeemed amen [Applause] [Laughter] Hallelujah so now we're talking in a court of law when two people or two parties are having a dispute so it's the Believers now being reconciled to God through Christ Jesus who was your Ransom he paid your Ransom have I lingered too long on this thought okay so now that that this is a court case brother Nathan have you ever gone to court that's a good thing we just see if we catch him huh he's not been to court I have case dismissed yeah am come on come on case dismissed guilty of the charges isn't there a song Don't you sing that song here brother Ben y of charges but I'm free from all charges through the blood of Jesus Christ amen so now brother Brown says this and there he is standing the Supreme judge showing he's Alpha he's not he's showing Alpha and Omega amen the beginning and the end and what an identification what quickening power he lets us see his coming this quickening power snatched us from death to life from being unequal to equal Hallelujah are you worthy that's going to be my question as we get down the road here are you Worthy yes so would the choir mind singing the song at the end and take the UN out yeah I didn't write the song I I told brother Ryan back home I'm sorry I had to say change the word he said brother Tom it's okay it's okay I'm not that hurt worthy Yes means you're befitting amen you have the weight of another thing that is of same value I'm giving you definition to be worthy is having worth it's a quality that renders value it's a quality that renders value so I want to say value for value value for value yeah amen years ago I'm sorry I I digress but maybe this might help years ago I read an article and the article was a um an ambassador from England went to a province in China and of course you know India they were the big Conquering the world they were in IND uh England they were in India they were in China they were many places and in this one Ambassador he set up an office and this fellow comes in and cleans his office and and um a chief of the district comes in and uh he's got a package all wrapped up brother Ray and and he gives it to him gives it to him and oh thank you very much that's very kind of you right I just showed up I'm in the Ambassador here from England and you know I represent the king and queen and all that sort of stuff and so unpackaged it and the fellow that cleans his office comes walking in and goes what and he says what what he goes the vase that's from the 15th dynasty of whatever of chin and he goes you know how much that's worth and he says no it's just the chief and brought me a a pause he says that I looked it up it was worth $32,000 at the time that was when they were making like 50 cents an hour so the fellow says W that's that's way too much and he puts it on a nice little stand and and then the fellow that cleans his office says what are you going to do he says what do you mean what are going to do I took the gift graciously he says no no no you're in China he says what do you mean I'm in China he says in China if somebody gives you a gift you have to give a gift back of same value I think he left China no he didn't but that's an Eastern custom and brother Ram said we have to look at the Bible because it's an Eastern book so so then if Jesus gave his life and laid his life down because he felt you were a value hung on a cross suffered ridiculed beaten striped and died that's value surely this church can rise to the occasion and say I'm going to lay my life down for Jesus Christ I'm going to give him equal value I'm going to lay my life down for him I'm going to walk like him talk like him amen something of value yeah amen it's not an old story it's a reality that my God and savior came in Jesus was his name amen now we'll move to weighing and the word worthy let's turn to Revelation chapter 5 thank you for putting up with me it's 1:00 we'll wind her down for you but we're just starting actually I know that makes my wife nervous when I do that Revelation 5 chap chter 5 verse1 and I saw in the right hand of him that that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal and Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book or neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on so so now I I sure don't want you to be nonchalant about what I'm talking about here yeah amen throughout 2,000 years there was no one worthy to even look on the book let's turn to Revelation 10 no one worthy to take the book no one worthy to look on the book but then Revelation 10:1 says and there came another Mighty Angel and there came I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a rainbow was upon his head and his face was were the Sun and his feet feet as were p uh pillars of fire and he had in his hand what a little book open so we all you've all known of course it was closed and we all know that that's Revelation 10:1 and now it's open but there was no one worthy to look on the book or to take the book there was no one found worthy but in this day I want you to get ahead of me actually right now but in this day there was a people that we're now called worthy come on not only to look on the book but to take the book not only to take the book but eat the book no generation no age was found worthy to look on it to take it but now in this age an angel came down handed it to Revelation 107 and he gave it to you take the book I take the book don't take the book eat the book come on people Rejoice 2,000 years no one was worthy to look on it but you've been given it you can eat it you can take it and you become the book value for [Applause] Value Praise His Holy [Music] name Hallelujah Luther wasn't worthy Wesley wasn't worthy col wasn't worthy ianus wasn't worthy no one was worthy to look on the book but in this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your [Applause] lifeall think of it young man think about it Andrew wasn't worthy huh Nathaniel wasn't worthy the disciples weren't worthy no one was worthy but the lamb was worthy and the lamb opened the seals took the book and his claiming work and in that that book was your name and you've been redeemed by a love divine are you still with me all right so now value for Value the word worthy maybe collectively because I don't want you to say the word worthy to me I want you to lift up your voice and say thou are worthy worthy Thou Are Worthy Lord Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy to be praised in the manner of worthy it means axus a x i oos axus that's three great words you qualify now to be a teacher of Greek axus meaning weighing as much as so you're found worthy you're being now weighed at the same weight I wish I had a a scales here you know the old scales and they put the weight here and the and and what you were buying here and that they had it figured out what what was worth right and God called an unbalanced scale an Abomination because there were there were trades people that would have other weights in their pocket when they saw brother pastor Wayne come by dressed in a nice suit they would say hey he can afford this and they would change the weight right that's why I always when I go buy shopping I get I wear my old jeans secret so that and God hat it's an Abomination to God weight is weight what you purchase has to be of equal weight so now we're looking at worthy Worthy is actually meaning weighing as much as or it's of same value or of same worth it means then the weight of another thing is being like of same value in other other words its root meaning means balancing the scales so let me put it into a graphic form yes sir here's a scale and Jesus stood on the scale and the scale is up here now because it's it right has to get balanced so Jesus stepped on the stale worthy worthy so there has to be somebody that's because he hates an unbalanced scale right so there has to be a people that step on this side of the scale to make this scale equal value are you still here you're still there so the root meaning of that word is the balancing of scales it's applying to an expectation of something that will correspond to what the weight is on that side of the scale so now what we see today is a prophet coming in our hour in the church age book and now turning to the bride and saying Church you are worthy so now the church steps on the scale and the scale is not imbalanced because it's an Abomination to be imbalanced so the the bride steps on this side and the bridegroom steps on this side and the scale is perfectly balanced so what does that mean brother Tom that means the value of what Christ is is your value amen praise the Lord Jesus who said you're not worth something on who said you're unworthy said when the prophet has been told by the God himself to call a church worthy then you could say by the grace of God I know it's a it's sometimes a bitter pill to swallow but just swallow it we were unworthy but through the blood of Jesus Christ he ransomed me you Lord and gave what was lacking in my scale the same weight as what he is it wasn't me it was his blood which was his life in me that balanced out Christ is he worthy he is worthy worthy the lamb that was slain Deuteronomy 25 and3 says Thou shalt not have in thy bag this is now getting serious Thou shalt not have in thy bag other doctrines it doesn't say that I just threw that in for to bring it down to our level yeah good Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights a great and a small for self or for others I put Thou shalt not have in thine house divver measures a great and a small but Thou shalt have a perfect and just weight a perfect and just measure shalt thou have that thy days be lengthened in the land which the Lord thy God liveth how important is a balance scale as we get closer to the closing winding up times more and more pertinent that we do not have great or small or any idea that is contrary to thus saith the Lord a just weight and balance are the Lord's all the weights of the bag are his work so what it says here in the Hebrew meaning fair business and measures are pleasing to God weigh it out weigh it out weigh it out amen weigh the scale of God's word out is he worthy yes he's worthy is he worthy that you would lay your life down for Christ yes he is young people you'll never be sorry you will never be sorry you will never have an imbalanced scale a false balance is an Abomination it's really and this is where it goes if you want to keep on following the chain goes into idolatry because if you can add something that's not true you can keep on adding and going into areas you should not go God's given his word word to give us a perfect balance it's human nature and unfortunately human nature can get you in trouble to be unscrupulous it's human nature it takes Christ in your life to stay Hest I shall end up with the quote so that you won't I won't be leaving me hanging sardine Sardinian Church H chapter 7 no they are like him he is them they are like him even as John said they see him as he is for they are worthy do you realize who's saying this it's Jesus the worthy one himself this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand who him who sits upon the throne and now this Worthy one is saying to his Saints who's his Saints you are worthy Hallelujah you are worthy he's the only one qualified that's right the only one qualified to judge and say you're worthy I would ask you to do me one favor at the closing of the service as I've preached on this part I'm worthy I would like you to say that the only reason I could ask you to say that is because he said you could you are that I couldn't ask you to say that you say oh no brother Tom I'm not worthy I mean we not even worthy of the being Charing that's the way we we have our attitude sometimes but if you want to take this little paragraph stick it on your fridge put it on your headboard put it by your night table do whatever you want to do but he wants if I could read the quote at the very beginning and say Jes Jesus is in you it's God manifesting himself in his last days in you it's the son of man revealing himself in you how could you say that without not knowing you're worthy so all the revelations that we have and all that God is revealing to us and will continue to reveal to us comes back to the very part if you say I'm no longer church but I'm bride the only way that you could say that this morning really without with a clear conscience knowing that you've been ransomed by the blood and he's paid your debt and he stepped on the scale and he gave you weight so that you could be equal with him the way you can say she is him is because you you can say Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy thou brother Ben would you come Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory glory and H glory and if you want to stand and lift up your hands for thou created has all things created thou H has created all things and for thy pleasure they are create oh praise him

it's been very powerful amen we certainly appreciate you've taken time to come and share the word and amen um and we appreciate you assigning a value to this congregation amen God bless you and thank thank you for assigning such a a high value to these people here today I I know that there's a there's a world out here would look at a group like this and they have a lot of low things to say but God has sent him here among you to say no that's not your value but your value is equal with almighty God now it's in the Book of Leviticus actually when the there was actually values assigned to people people and then there would be a ransom put in the courts for them and sometimes there would be someone they didn't know what to do so the the priest were given the job of assigning a value to Ransom the person and this morning you've had a priest stand in the office here and ass signning a value to this congregation and to you as a Believer God gave him the permission to assign that value to you and he stands there by the word of God and says now you're equal don't don't say anything less than that and I know maybe it would even be hard for you to believe but God who is rich in Mercy sent a prophet Among Us and he said life is so valuable that he wrote it on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he said he went all the way to Chicago for one Soul he said because one soul is worth 10 thousand worlds I'll tell you this this this Human Side Of You the sign the value brother BR said maybe just a few cents is what you're worth but the soul that you have brother Bram said it's so precious that God gave his own son's blood that he might redeem you and pay that ransom for you this morning I'll tell you it's a powerful it's a powerful reality it's and it you know what it takes more faith to believe that than to believe you're not worthy it really takes more faith to to agree with a man of God this morning and say that's nothing but the truth that's the truth and I believe that's the truth I I think that from my heart of this congregation and the men of God around the world and the congregations the value to me it's it's the cream of the crop when I hear uh when I hear people they go negative on them message people them message people I whoa what do you mean them m message people that's God's elect the most valuable thing in the world is these Saints and Sons and Daughters of God and amen it's a it's a powerful thing uh and and we certainly man we we really appreciate this morning of the of the reminder and the assignment of the value of
