from the Red Sea even into the sea of the Philistines and from the desert unto the river for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee amen

impossible God always shows up and shows out he's never failed us one time we may feel like sometimes he's a little late but we realize at the end of the day he's never late he's always on time he's got everything under his control and brother BR told us one time that that God had everything pre-planned he he knew every person will be here in this Tabernacle tonight he pre-planned it Generations back amen that's a kind of God we serve tonight he knows every sand that's on the Seas Shore he knows every Star in the heavens he knows exactly where you are in your journey he knew exactly what you've been through he knows exactly where you're going amen what a mighty God we serve tonight and he just simply telling them here that I'm your God I I'm I I will not fail you I'm going to be with you I'm going to lead you I'm going to guide you and I'm going to give you this land yet there's going to be inhabitants that's dwelling in that land but don't be dismayed he by by the great numbers or how big they are how great they are amen just remember this I'm the Lord God and I'm going to be with you and I'm going to give the inhabitant into your land and we'll find over in Joshua chapter one he tells them the same thing he said as as I was with Moses I'm going to be with you he tells he simply tells Joshua says Rise stand to your feet become powerful this is the day that the Lord has made amen he tells him that I'm going to be with you as I was with Moses I'm going to be with you as I led them in their The Exodus of coming out amen and Pharaoh couldn't stop them plagues couldn't stop them the Red Sea couldn't stop him Heen I believe tonight that Joshua was rehearsing those things in his mind and saying hey if God was with them and and Farah couldn't stop him what about today I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and he God I'm the Lord God I change not amen he just as powerful as he was leading them out of Exodus as he was going to lead him into the promised land amen he told Joshua said everywhere the place of your feet shall tread upon I'm going to give it to you amen The Good the footsteps of a good man are ordered of the Lord do you believe that so he tells them I'm not only going to give you the land but I'm going to deliver the inhabitants of the land into your your hands and you're going to possess your possession and the seed shall possess the gates of his enemy can you say amen and numbers CH 33: 51 he says speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan then you should drive drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all the mten images and quite pluck down all the high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land he never told them they wouldn't be there he just encouraged them I'm your God and I'm bigger than your Giants amen I don't believe it's any different today amen we he we didn't come of this thing as a picnic brother BR said when you receive the Holy Ghost yes sir every gun of hell is pointing at you amen and shooting at you it's not a picnic but it's a battle but greater is he that is in you than the he that's in the world do you believe that you realize he's telling your you I'm going to give you the land it's yours but but don't be dismayed by what you're going to see with the natural eyes amen but look beyond the look at the Unseen and realize amen no matter where you are I'm going to be and inside those footsteps is going to be exactly what you have need of so don't be afraid soldiers and I to take a footstep cuz every footstep that's ordered of the Lord there's footsteps of Grace footsteps of Mercy footsteps of power footsteps of anointing footsteps of healing everything that you have need of for the next step is going to be in the footprint I encourage you tonight if you've been struggling to walk just keep on walking then brother Brown brother Wayne say it is God's business and open up the sea he said all we are commissioned here just keep on walking amen we may not know what's tomorrow but we know a God that holds our tomorrow amen don't that mean a lot to us tonight yes sir amen Our God will never leave us or forsake us I think this is beautiful you can never Escape The Blessing nothing in time can separate you from the blessing that God had in store for you before the foundation of the world th seed can never Escape The Blessing Moses couldn't escape it Joshua couldn't escape it Abra couldn't escape it I believe tonight we're not going to be able to escape it either brother says it like this but it gives us consolation to know this that we do not hold our destiny god holds our destiny and he's ordained it to be so and there's nothing will ever interrupt are you hearing me church tonight there's nothing going to ever interrupt in other words stop Hinder prevent slow down amen interrupt the program of God he says we are bound to arrive amen he's the one that started this and he's also the finisher of this great battle this great fight amen he didn't start this to lose you he start this tonight amen he's going to see you through aen he told Paul he was going to Rome a lot of things transpired from the time that he got the promise and T he walked into Rome he was snake bit Thro into prison ship wrecked but brother Brown and brother R says we can find a hiding place where the world becomes soundproof not that the world you're not in the world but the world doesn't affect you any longer Hallelujah and Paul could say like this none of these things move me that's right that's right sir I'm here to tell you Paul made it to Rome and if Paul made it to Rome I say you as a Believer is going to make it a home too we're pilgrims and strangers in a foreign land amen but God got something special in store for you tonight but God's grace we'll get to some of it tonight God's good to us man I feel his presence tonight yes do you feel his presence Ezekiel chapter 37 the first verse this was a time that the kingdom has been depleted through the years of captivity and once blessed and prosperous nation was walking around in a place of dryness brother Wayne and the first verse says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and he calls me a pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and L they were very dry looked like an impossible situation to the world it was hopeless and he's inviting Ezekiel take a look let me take you on a trip let me show you the impossible situation have you ever been there amen and but I say tonight that nothing is impossible to my God he may be 4 days late but he's always on time Lazarus was in a bad situation amen he was he was dead in a grave somewhere death clo was upon Him amen the skin was taken over his body but then Jesus came by the voice of Resurrection came walking by amen something begin to happen and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest Lazarus come forth Lazarus couldn't escape the blessing Aben skin wors had to give away loose him and let him go there was Freedom there was Liberty at the sound of the voice of Resurrection Hallelujah this world may be given up on you churches may have given up on you religion may give up have given up on you maybe your family has given up on you amen but I got good news to you tonight my God has never lost anything my God can never lose anything he's a god of restoration he's a god of restoring it's a promise I will restore my God can't lose anything yes sir when there was a law when in the Garden of Eden amen when it looked like all hoes were gone but in the back parts of God's mind there was something screaming out I'll put everything screaming out I'm going to restore I'm going to bring back Hallelujah and I believe he's done it we're just living in the fruits of it we're living in an age not just coming out but going in right amen he's a god of restoration and again he said un me prophesy upon these bones and say to him oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord hear the word of the Lord Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word you may seem dry it may seem hopeless may just look like dry bones or some but God is looking Beyond the circumstances and he sees the potentials Hallelujah that's my God tonight we may look and see failure brother John we may see and look look hopeless hey we as Believers could go through a time where we're searching we're missing seems like something's missing it's maybe a dried time of your life and we might look in the mirror as our worst enemy and think what a failure I am what a guy that falls short and falls on his back but God's looking down from the heavens and he sees the potentials of some dry bones down in the valley it made it look hopeless to Ezekiel it might it look hopeless to the land but God knew the potentials that was laying down there the bones were scattered out throughout the valley but God is a god of restoring God is a god of restoration he's a God to restored back what people has given up on my boy I could preach there for a [Music] moment thus sayith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live you should be quickened amen message of Hope and I will lay Sinners upon you I will give you the ability to become what you once was there a Revival fixing to take place amen so he prophesied I commanded and I prophesied there was a noise and behold there was shaking bones were scattered abroad because of time because of something that happened in time amen but couldn't keep God's purpose to come in the past there was bones scattered everywhere but didn't change the fact something is fixing to take place restoration fixing to take place a Revival is fixing a transpire and behold they be they were shaking and Bones come together bone to his bone a Boneyard Revival there was some noise of pray prise a noise of worship and when I behold the Senus of Flesh Came Upon them and skin covered them above but there was no breath in them you know this age that we're living in no doubt the blindness and nakedness dryness just seems like this world is totally going insane but in the midst of all of that oh yeah can these bones live again thou knowest Lord oh Hallelujah for he seen you shouting he's seen you screaming shouting over your your battles he's seen the potentials that was in these bones a potentials for rapture a potential for body change a potential for for overcoming and conquering some saying it's helpless some says it's hopeless some says this message is this that of the other but my people God says amen my people is going to experience restoration is going to experience resurrection and and our Prophet brother ra can say like this what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is he has turned us back Hallelujah going to get ahead of myself tonight God's good then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say unto the wind thus say the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied and he commanded me and breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet exceeding great army they couldn't escape a blessing he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and hope is lost and we are cut off from our parts therefore prophesy and sayto them thus sayeth the Lord God doesn't that move you tonight thus say sayith the Lord yes sir behold all my people I will open up your Graves he's a god of Resurrection I'll open up your Graves I'll cause you to come up out of your past out of your Graves out of your Dark Places hallelujah amen I'm going to call all you people there's some murmuring complaining going on but he said thus say the Lord God I'm the Lord God of restoration I'm going to lift you up when the world couldn't religion couldn't churches couldn't he said but I'm going to come and lift you up out of your [Music] Graves that's Hallelujah I'm going to cause you to come up out of your grace I know you can't but I can and I'm going to bring you into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord when I've opened up your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your conditions Graves and I shall put my spirit in you I think we could read this passage of scripture and dismiss I can I'm going to put my spirit within you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then you shall know that I the the Lord have spoken and performed it sayth the Lord and brother B picks that up he says hear you dry bones the word of the Lord s you skin come upon them and they stood up as a mighty Army and begin to March towards Zion he says glory to God that's him that's him that's his victory that's exactly what is happening today in our hour these dry bones begin to Crave to be there's a there's a strong thirst a deep thirst of the soul for more of him there is a deep desire for a Rapture there is a deep thirst for body [Applause] change and they stood to their feet brother Wayne as a seeding great Army amen they stood to their feet for what purpose to destroy that's right to take over to run this race I have a witness tonight amen and and message turns to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison that sin that once ruled you you rule it now I'm going to have a bride she's not a second cousin she's not a step sister or brother he but she's the Bride of Jesus Christ amen she's not laying down in defeat but she's standing upon her feet as exceeding great Army marching towards Zion and brother man would say like this she is him that's him oh if we can look AC across this building tonight that's him that's him that's his victory that's his glory that's who he is hallelujah it's not for age in the future this is it Church we're not looking for it to come the Rapture isn't an event it's you and I tonight it's his victory yes once dry bones but now revived Hallelujah and place in their land and death cannot strike that's right brother R death can't strike where the lamb is that's hallelujah amen listen there's life behind this lamb where the lamb is there peace where the lamb is there's joy where the lamb is there's Victory where the lamb is there's freedom in the name of Jesus every knee shall bow I say tonight demons has got to Bow depression has to Bow sickness has to Bow how many's free tonight John tells us if the sun therefore shall make you free ye what shall you can't escape it you shall be free free indeed in other words at Liberty from the Dominion of your past your chains your bars that sin that once so easily besets you now it's in your past and past just simply gone by in time and no longer in existence are we living in that Liberty tonight amen are we living under the freedom of the message of the [Applause] hour amen we're not set free in a n like for ex for illustration tonight brother Wayne if I was in prison for something not done and maybe they they sentenced me to to life in prison without parole maybe they throw the book at me and in my mind I'm thinking I'm going to get out of here I'm going to I'm going to set myself free and maybe as you you know we've heard the stories is maybe got to pick and begin to pick my way out amen it might have took days months years but one day I pick my way outside of the Prison Walls and the and the prison cell and and the bondage of prison but you know what it followed me everywhere I went that chain that ball chain following me because I escaped that's fear follow me you try to change your identity amen your name is over every Television over every radio over every buletin board amen amen there's always fear fallowing your life and and there's always a fear you know why because the courts hadn't gave you the Seal of the approval amen so the law has the ability to take you back oh glory amen I can think of the time amen when Moses as a one man invasion was going down to take over Egypt he went down he tortured Pharaoh he said let my people go he didn't go down to compromise with him he didn't go down to say you can keep this por with no I'm not going to leave a hood behind to a place brother R said he said Moses why don't you get all you got and get out of here that's right that's right and no doubt there was many that try to escape but Pharaoh had the ability to go and bring them right back but this time it was different that's right God be to pull him out in the exodus by a mighty hand of Jehovah and when the enemy was coming in like a flood God lifted up a standard against them that's right and all night long brother Zach Aben God kept the enemy at Bay and at the rising of the sun there was came a wind of Yahweh out of the heavens and begin to divide the sea dry to ground and God's people couldn't escape the blessing they begin to walk over on dry ground and when they got to the other side when the last one reached the other side God allowed the enemy to come in but this blessing wasn't designed for them that's right the very road that led to their Deliverance is going to lead to their destruction hallelujah hallelujah and I can imagine as God looked down on the pill of fire with Angry Eyes and came down and took the chariot wheels off and they read them in the ground and the wind of Yahweh came and ceased and the waters came to destroy their enemy and maram and grabbed the tambourine and begin to dance in the spirit as I looked back and seen their enemy was dead church this was a different response this was a different song this this was a different dance they was not escapes they was free free indeed and that's the way we are church tonight we're no longer escapes we can't go back we don't have the ability to go back who the son has made free is free indeed hallelujah how many's free tonight hallelujah what a freedom dance but Jonathan who was different how many sung that song how how many danced that day Dan how many screamed that scream because why amen you tried many times just exonerate yourself you come to alar you said you said that this time a going to change and you go right back to the old the elements of this world but one day I say one day Mercy came walking by your way it was a predestinated moment of time well this time you couldn't escape the blessing Hallelujah hallu he says brother B says who the son has made free is free indeed he says no bondage no looking over your shoulder free in the Liberty where Christ has not just set you free but made you you free he says that's right go ahead and knock that little havit out go ahead and kick that little Jeb youright go ahead and kick that little sin that so beat you over in your past go ahead and kick it out of your life this is your land this is your time Hallelujah take that little Canaanite kick him out of the way you're not Escape you're made free free indeed then this message declares your freedom yeah and you can't escape it amen that's no matter what they try to do they can try to condemn you they can they can bring the modern balms and botom baac and try to condemn you of your past and condemn you of your failures my my God's always a step ahead of him brother Brown said they failed to realize there was a brazing serpent there was already atonement that was in effect when God looked down aen he couldn't see only thing he could see amen was the sacrifice the atonement and they look down as white as snow oh Hallelujah that's my God Amen when they tried to curse God's children only thing they could do is bless them cuz they couldn't escape the blessing Hallelujah I had to skip some of this God's good isn't he numbers 23 and 21 says he has not beheld the iniquity of Jacob neither has seen the perverseness of Israel the Lord is God is with him and the shout of the king is among them the shout being a jubilant Sound by which the presence of the Lord as their King is among them there's a shout of the king a message that has gone forward he said we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something God before the foundation of the world left you something it wasn't given to you in time it was giving you from eternity that's right he said it was name was written on the book that when the L would be slain you'd be recognized with it so you inherited something as a natural real I would if my father would leave me a will be my name in his will he would he would begin to write down possessions and attaching my name or his offsprings to names on the wheel and he seal it to the de of the testator yes that's right and the only one has the ability to break the seal is the executive of his will and when it comes time after the death of my father the executive would take the wheel and he would break it and he would be begin to uh notify he would begin the summons [Music] right not everyone would get that call you and Lima Ohio would never get a phone call from the executive my father's will neither would I yours because your name isn't on the book Hallelujah right but when he begins to call there's there's there's a there there's a there's a deep calling to the Deep yes sir Hallelujah and he notified me that my name was in the whe he notified me amen that I was always an eagle those other birds in the barnyard and said this message has called me eagle or a chicken rather or vulture or a crow but you he said they didn't call me that at all it notified me I came from God and I'm going back to God this message notified me amen I'm not just forgiven I'm Justified as though I never done it in the first [Music] place Hallelujah have you been notified the Barnyard held you for a season but you're coming out amen that's right yeah the message doesn't notify everyone but it does notify all those that was a part of him before the foundation of the world and he says I can't lose one of them it may look like some dry bones out in the open Valley of Lady OA amen but God knows the potentials amen you might have had five husbands and the one that you're living with ain't your own amen but God Jesus seen the potentials brother Brown said in future home that he bypassed the priest and went down to a woman that was in a bad situation but she had representation in heaven Hallelujah that's the reason why I'm shouting tonight because I heard the notification I'm not second cousin I'm not a chicken that's right my feathers are different he let me know where I came from where I'm living and where I'm going he told me that my papa put my name in the L's book of life amen he spoke it Hallelujah don't don't be don't shout tonight because demons are subject to you but shout because your name has been written on the land's Book of Life you've got inheritance it doesn't matter what anybody thinks of me right they can talk about me they can standardize my name doesn't really move me I know who I come from I know who my daddy is I've recognized this message of be Eagle food I left that other carcass of the world I've been changed I've been changed I've been restored this body is failing me we've been talking about it I'm getting gray hair now he been a year and a half from 50 years old right this body is going back to the dust where it came from but down inside of this body lays a germ seed of life the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away amen nobody can talk it out of there nobody can take it from me Hallelujah Hall I say you're a value tonight I don't care what anybody else thinks of you tonight amen Jesus Christ found value in you amen are you a Believer tonight how many's a Believer tonight heav he's got a germ seat of life living down inside of you tonight amen you're a value tonight I you might have heard this story before you're going to hear it again Heen if I ask somebody tonight brother Wayne do you want this $20 I wish I would have had a hundred been a little bit more enticing but I travel with my wife up here you know how that is easy easy now I say brother Wayne do you want this $20 would you like to have this oh yeah yeah and if I tuck and I crumbled it up said Wayne do you still want that and I took it maybe I dropped it and I stomped upon it I said ' do you still want that $20 bill he said yes I want that $20 bill why because it didn't change the value it doesn't change it there's a number there's a code on this there's identification number that's on this bill that takes it all the way back till there's a portion of gold to back it up Hallelujah and brother B said that's exactly what aen it took you all the way back and brother Brown said and he backed it up hallelujah amen listen friends Satan can't have this land forever Hallelujah your time is drawn near he can only have it in season because the received it in time Hallelujah boo devil I say you're a value tonight that germ seat of life it's all backed up pre-planned of God from the beginning and it's backed up you say well you might say well my memory tells me what I've done what I did 20 years ago what I did 10 years ago what I did yesterday but we've been notified by the message of the hour God doesn't examine you come on somebody that's shout material God doesn't examine you he examines a lamb I say well he said I'm not good enough to come out of this wheelchair he said that's right you're not but God is and he doesn't examine you he examines Christ and because he examines the lamb tonight I'm free praise the Lord Lord I'm free no longer bound no more chain holding me I'm free free indeed I don't care what that squarter thinks can we have a Caleb mentality tonight I'm just as strong as coming out as I'm going in amen give me my Mountain there was inhabitant in there but he says give me my Mountain the same God that was leading him when he said we are more than able to take the land is the same God at his old age saying I don't I didn't come this far those squaders can't keep my land Forever This is my inheritance do you love him the king's message notified us that the devil's only a squatter and the Jubilee sound has given us the authority that's right to drop the hole look back into the enemy look back of Satan look back of that sin that once ruled you and says Satan this is not your land any longer under the revealing of this will amen amen listen Jesus Christ become the executive of his own will nobody else could do it he came down and became the executor of his own will under the revealing of the son of man our response is different not today devil you might have got me yesterday but not today devil the squatters got the land because of time and it has an End Amen this quarter's days are numbered are you hearing me somebody you could shout on that tonight amen that squad's days are numbered he cannot keep the land forever that's right Hallelujah because it wasn't his at the first place that's and this slave has been notified by the king's message when The Exodus Jubilee sounds you don't have to buy it back you don't have to buy it back you don't have to go and purchase it no no all you got to do is go receive it for the squatter's days are numbered we cannot lose our inheritance forever that's we got inheritance I'm fixing clothes don't want to about fixing clothes and our inheritance belongs to us our inheritance he says he said there had to be somebody to leave it to me he said Jesus left your inheritance he says beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance and brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the land's book of life before the foundation of the world God gave you the inheritance your inheritance was first Hallelujah God he said God sent Jesus to make the inheritance real to you and me that's right Hallelujah he says devils are on the move for Jesus Christ the chief Captain said in my name they shall cast out Devils they failed to get it 40 years ago but we're coming in now possessing the land the same pillar fire the same pillar fire the same Chief Captain is leading this host of the Lord he says it's your land God promised you to prosper in health he gave you that body it's yours by possession and the devil is trying to take it over but he can't hold it forever he hasn't got the authority to do it and he said Satan is trembling tonight that's right why is Satan trembling tonight brother Ronnie because he's know if a Believer here tonight amen ever come to a revelation that he is a squatter he has a bow with no arrows he's a be and makes a lot of noise but he has no power Hallelujah he said he's trembling tonight because somebody's going to recognize that he can't hold this and inheritance forever you was once subject of sin Mar and Corruption he said but now can you say now now now it's got the earnest right brother John he said it's turned Heavenly in other words it's turned it's going somewhere come on church we as a Believers we're not just coming to church as a ritual amen we're just not journeying this world as a ritual we're going somewhere that's right we don't preach sermons just to make
