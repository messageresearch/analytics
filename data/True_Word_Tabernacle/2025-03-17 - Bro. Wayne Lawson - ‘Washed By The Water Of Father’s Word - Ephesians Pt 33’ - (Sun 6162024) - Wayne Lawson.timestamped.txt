[8:51] anointing this morning in the house of
[8:52] the Lord and
[8:54] amen amen we're so uh honored amen that
[8:58] he would come come and show his presence
[9:01] Among Us and his Mercy amen what a what
[9:04] a what a blessed people we are this
[9:06] morning to to be able to have such a
[9:09] such a presence Amen in such a cold and
[9:12] dark world Amen but that that sun
[9:16] strikes the top of the tree first amen
[9:20] and that's where that Zion means that
[9:23] Sunny Hill that mountain where the sun
[9:25] shining and and you can feel the Rays of
[9:28] it this morning even as it shines upon
[9:30] the Church of the Living God and we in
[9:32] that third level catch that light as it
[9:35] shines in the evening amen what a what a
[9:37] blessing to be here today and amen we we
[9:40] do um thank the Lord for his grace and
[9:42] his Mercy this morning and um we want to
[9:46] maybe if we could just stand together
[9:48] today amen I know we're just going to go
[9:50] on a word of prayer but we do want to
[9:53] thank um you know in this time of this
[9:55] time I uh I think of fatherhood and I
[9:58] think of the moment that we live and I
[10:01] think uh if you study the statistics and
[10:04] I'm not getting into it today but the
[10:06] number one trouble that we have in the
[10:08] world today is a lack of
[10:10] fatherhood a lack of men taking
[10:13] positions and I know why it's a lot of
[10:15] pressure uh but but the men that have
[10:18] stood up and we want to thank you and to
[10:20] our elders in this church we certainly
[10:23] thank you and of course brother
[10:25] Ericson's like a dad to us all and we
[10:27] certainly thank you brother Ray
[10:29] thank you for
[10:30] [Applause]
[10:38] standing the position itself of
[10:41] fatherhood uh means a nourisher
[10:43] protector and upholder so you can see
[10:46] why that we would say that he would be
[10:48] like a dad to us and uh so we want to
[10:51] this morning just before we read the
[10:53] word let's just bow our hearts for a
[10:55] moment and let's speak to our father
[10:58] Lord we bow our heart this
[11:01] morning and even when your disciples ask
[11:04] you how they should pray you told them
[11:08] to begin with saying Our Father which
[11:11] art in
[11:12] heaven and Lord for us to be able to
[11:15] call you our
[11:16] father to know that you're our provider
[11:20] our supplier our
[11:22] protector oh Lord how that it settles
[11:26] our heart to know this morning that
[11:28] you're the one behind it
[11:31] all father we're asking you this morning
[11:34] that may the great
[11:36] presence of your living being come in
[11:39] this
[11:39] room father we bow our hearts in your
[11:43] presence and we ask you oh God as an
[11:46] assembly may you forgive every
[11:48] shortcoming
[11:50] Lord May father it just make a
[11:53] resounding feeling in this room this
[11:56] morning that each heart and each life
[11:59] have come to you this morning and ask
[12:02] for your great grace over them and that
[12:05] you would just come into this building
[12:06] Lord and you would break your word this
[12:08] morning that you would wash hearts and
[12:11] minds and that you would feed Souls Lord
[12:14] we're asking you today that you would
[12:16] make yourself known Among Us Lord and we
[12:19] want to welcome you here and father we
[12:22] invite you now to come take this part of
[12:25] the service and use it for thy Divine
[12:27] glory in Jesus name name we pray amen
[12:32] and amen and God bless you if you have
[12:35] your Bibles today amen we would like to
[12:38] go to Ephesians chapter 5: 26 and verses
[12:44] 27 uh if you were with us Thursday night
[12:48] uh we spoke of on the washing of the
[12:51] Water by the word and I went into the
[12:54] Old Testament to show uh how that God
[12:57] provided now if you know notice the
[12:59] father is a provider how that God
[13:01] provided to the people in ashes of red
[13:05] heer which actually meant they just took
[13:06] the ashes of the red heer and mixed it
[13:09] with the water and that water was a
[13:12] water that washed them so in Ephesians 5
[13:14] and 26 that he might
[13:16] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[13:19] of the Water by the word that he might
[13:21] present it to himself a glorious church
[13:25] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[13:28] thing but that it should be holy and
[13:32] without blemish amen may God bless his
[13:35] word as you could be seated this morning
[13:38] amen of course amen speaking to you
[13:40] about that we um we spoke about the uh
[13:44] about the ashes of the red heer and how
[13:47] that they burned the red heer with cedar
[13:49] and Hep and and they burned that all
[13:52] together and they did it so that it
[13:54] would be mixed and so that means that
[13:56] you can't have just part of the gospel
[13:59] you got to have the whole thing I I
[14:01] loved brother uh Tim pret's example of a
[14:04] of a cliping a chicken wing amen if you
[14:07] get a one one wied animal it just runs
[14:10] circles amen I thought the whole meeting
[14:13] would have been worth it just for that
[14:14] one point amen it was so powerful amen
[14:17] but but you see amen uh it must be mixed
[14:20] together it's a mix and that's the
[14:22] beautiful thing is the right mix between
[14:25] the word and the spirit brings life now
[14:27] this morning I want to speak to you on
[14:29] this that we are Washed by the father's
[14:32] words Washed by the father's words so I
[14:35] don't want you to lose my direction or
[14:38] where we're going but it'll take me a
[14:40] moment to get there but just stay with
[14:42] me we're we're going to be uh we're
[14:44] going to be headed toward this washing
[14:46] of the Water by the word by the father's
[14:49] word now of course fatherhood is uh the
[14:52] very origin of the word father in the
[14:54] Bible amen it means of course a uh uh it
[14:58] means means to be a nourisher a
[15:02] protector or an upholder amen and you
[15:05] know the when someone says to you
[15:08] fatherhood amen it means more of a
[15:10] position that someone would hold because
[15:13] you know sometimes that there are people
[15:15] maybe who don't have specific Earthly
[15:18] fathers that have uh been fathers they
[15:21] and then they have people in their lives
[15:23] who have not at all been a genetic
[15:25] father but have been a great father unto
[15:27] them in other words some the person that
[15:29] would nourish and protect and and and
[15:32] and give to them amen so that's why
[15:35] sometimes there's like surrogate
[15:36] fatherhood or where there is a
[15:38] mentorship and things of this nature
[15:40] because actually uh real fatherhood when
[15:43] we say the word fatherhood this morning
[15:45] we we say father but really who defines
[15:49] what that word means and where does that
[15:50] really come from who is it that is able
[15:53] to to say what fatherhood means but you
[15:56] see brother brandham was telling you
[15:57] this he says now
[15:59] and and of course brother bram's own way
[16:01] of doing it he said I have a a young
[16:03] daughter sitting back there and she's my
[16:05] sweetheart and he said you couldn't hurt
[16:07] the child without hurting
[16:10] me now that was that's a pretty powerful
[16:13] thing and you'd have to be a dad to
[16:15] understand that that you you couldn't
[16:17] hurt one of my children without hurting
[16:19] me and brother M is saying this that you
[16:21] know you couldn't hurt the child without
[16:23] that because that's my baby and I love
[16:25] her and and and another little fell at
[16:27] home a little over years year old and he
[16:29] said she was trying to talk goooo and d
[16:31] da and he says now you couldn't hurt
[16:34] that child without hurting me so he's
[16:35] showing you different ages but they're
[16:37] both his children and one maybe talks a
[16:40] little pler and the other one goooo gyy
[16:42] but they're both his children and you
[16:44] couldn't hurt the child without hurting
[16:46] me now I hope you're hearing what a
[16:48] prophet's saying amen that when God has
[16:51] children now some of them are different
[16:53] ages and some of them talk different and
[16:54] some of them maybe uh understand things
[16:57] a little different but if you h one
[16:59] you've hurt the Lord and he says now I'd
[17:01] rather that you love that child than to
[17:04] love me now if there had to be love one
[17:07] for the other you love my child instead
[17:10] of me and I think that's what fatherhood
[17:13] is like now it that's what fatherhood is
[17:16] like so if you really want to get God's
[17:18] attention you start loving his children
[17:21] do wonderful things for his children
[17:24] amen that's fatherhood then and if that
[17:26] is fatherhood it is an attribute of of
[17:29] God then if we be God's children then
[17:32] God wants us to love one another and
[17:34] then doing so we love God now watch this
[17:37] then fatherhood is an attribute of God
[17:40] so what you what you classify as a
[17:42] father and if you really ever see a real
[17:44] father and you see him really being a
[17:46] father to his family then you look at
[17:49] that and there's something of admiration
[17:51] in your heart to see someone stay or to
[17:54] go through things or trials and they
[17:56] they really are a father over their home
[17:58] there's many many of you that are great
[17:59] examples of this but but that attribute
[18:02] didn't come from you that attribute come
[18:04] from God that's why you can see
[18:06] fatherhood in men who don't even have
[18:08] children because it's not the it's not
[18:11] uh it's after an attribute of God so you
[18:14] recognize that it is and we also uh we
[18:17] um how could we say this when we see it
[18:19] we respect it and we love it because
[18:21] it's a great it's a great feeling to see
[18:24] that because you know then fatherhood is
[18:27] real
[18:29] that it it actually is real it's not
[18:31] just some put on something fatherhood is
[18:34] real now uh and I see men do things for
[18:37] their children and they uh uh act
[18:39] certain ways and and but yet they do
[18:41] that out of love and it's just as what a
[18:44] father does now brother B says now see
[18:47] here's the thing and the comforter if
[18:49] we'll just live close to him he'll
[18:51] provide something else for us now that
[18:53] is an Insight that we can see what
[18:55] ordinary persons never see when you're
[18:58] born again and you see him you know him
[19:00] you can have seen him and he will abide
[19:03] with you forever oh he is a good father
[19:07] now he is the Fountain of all goodness
[19:11] amen the great resource of all goodness
[19:14] and fatherhood belongs in our God he is
[19:18] so good to his believing children he
[19:21] provides the sunshine and we couldn't
[19:23] live without it see we couldn't live it
[19:25] because there would be nothing growing a
[19:27] sunshine is a great thing see yet we
[19:29] look and we say oh it's the Sun so we
[19:32] look over at it but the sunshine is
[19:34] important to our life and it helps us
[19:36] and give us strength and the natural man
[19:39] see it's a spiritual Sunshine that we
[19:41] can live in all nature types of
[19:44] spiritual like we had good food that we
[19:46] eat at the table it's a type of good
[19:49] food that we eat from the word of God
[19:51] see what it is is an outward expression
[19:53] so you can look at the Sun and you say
[19:55] oh how wonderful the Sun but there's a
[19:57] source of that sun you can you can drink
[19:59] the water and there's a source of that
[20:01] and and the source of all of that is Our
[20:04] Father which is in heaven and provided
[20:07] the Natural Things of life that we might
[20:09] be able but that same father also amen
[20:13] is has the responsibility of our
[20:15] spiritual lives and and it's just like a
[20:17] natural father if all we do is work and
[20:20] live in an economy and provide for the
[20:22] home but there must also be the
[20:24] spiritual nourishment of a home so that
[20:26] is an attribute of almighty God as he is
[20:29] the father of all of us he is the one
[20:32] that provides that now now God himself
[20:35] loves fatherhood and this this quote
[20:37] specifically is very powerful it's
[20:39] Christ The Mystery of God revealed and
[20:41] brother Ram explaining of course if
[20:43] you've heard many people they say well
[20:45] God has a purpose but you see but the
[20:47] message of the hour is that brother
[20:50] randam told us what the purpose of God
[20:52] was it's not just God has a purpose but
[20:55] we know what his purpose is and he said
[20:58] the first thing he wanted to do is to
[21:00] reveal himself to the people and he
[21:02] couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who
[21:04] covered space and time and he could he
[21:06] is too great to ever be revealed to the
[21:08] people because it was too mysterious and
[21:11] how could that great being see then
[21:13] after we went beyond the cycles of
[21:15] hundreds and billions and trillions of
[21:17] years of light space and on out into the
[21:19] infinite and Eternity a creative culture
[21:22] now this is a seventh grade education
[21:24] speaking here and a great culture that
[21:27] it was he said but what what he wanted
[21:29] to do amen I love that what he wanted to
[21:32] do what God's intended purpose what he
[21:36] wanted to do is he loved fatherhood and
[21:40] he was a father and the only way that he
[21:44] could express it was to become the son
[21:47] of man see that's the reason Jesus kept
[21:50] saying son of man they don't know what
[21:53] he was talking about many of them see do
[21:56] you get that he wanted to express
[21:59] and one of his great three-fold purposes
[22:00] now watch this God loves fatherhood and
[22:04] he is a great father but the only way to
[22:07] express his fatherhood was that he would
[22:09] become the son of man I Tell You Folks
[22:12] when you stop and think about that just
[22:14] for a moment you realize then that the
[22:17] only way that God could ever express
[22:19] himself was as the son of man that the
[22:23] son of man would be God's expression of
[22:26] fatherhood that would be when you see
[22:29] the son of man then you see expression
[22:31] of fatherhood now what is fatherhood it
[22:33] is protector it is provider amen it is a
[22:37] Defender you see then the son of man the
[22:39] ministry of son of man would be the
[22:42] provider of the church it would be the
[22:44] nourisher it would be the protector all
[22:47] of the things that a father is to his
[22:49] family the son of man Ministry would be
[22:52] to the Church of the Living God it would
[22:55] be fatherhood now watch brother bam
[22:57] explain this in questions and answers
[22:59] the pillar of fire is a logos that went
[23:01] out of God it's actually the attribute
[23:03] of the fullness of God and it come into
[23:05] the form where it could be seen and the
[23:07] anointing of that Spirit went forth
[23:09] condescending see God the Father the
[23:12] logos that was over Israel he says had
[23:15] to become a blood offering see the Loos
[23:18] amen become flesh and dwelt among us and
[23:21] that is where the Loos dwelt in the
[23:22] human body was as a sacrifice and when
[23:25] that man was made in the image of God
[23:28] God came came down see father came down
[23:30] in the image of man to redeem man that
[23:34] brought man and God together see God and
[23:37] man Embrace when you look at the cross
[23:39] amen I'm talking about fatherhood you're
[23:42] talking about father doing something so
[23:44] he could provide healing to the church
[23:47] so he could provide sin sacrifice to the
[23:50] church father did this you you could
[23:53] just look at the cross and you could say
[23:55] oh it's this and it's this but what the
[23:57] real intended purpose is is that God
[24:00] would show fatherhood to the Church of
[24:02] the Living God that he would show care
[24:05] he would take responsibility he wouldn't
[24:07] just let you go he wouldn't just let you
[24:09] be he wouldn't just let it go with that
[24:12] but father left his home in glory and
[24:16] took on a human body to redeem your life
[24:20] I'll tell you this God embraced each
[24:22] other brother man said it God and man
[24:24] embraced each other as fatherhood and
[24:27] sunship when the logos became flesh and
[24:30] dwelt among them that's why Jesus said I
[24:33] come from God and I go back to God it's
[24:36] the death burial and resurrection and
[24:38] Ascension and he was taken back to sit
[24:40] at the right hand see it was the
[24:41] authority that he returned to now in the
[24:44] paragraph 110 he says it like this the
[24:47] logos that was in him which was the
[24:49] spirit of God that anointing through the
[24:52] satifying grace of the blood brought
[24:54] many sons to God which is Anointed with
[24:58] the same
[25:01] logos now I tell you amen the expression
[25:04] of human language was not I don't have
[25:07] the ability to deliver to you the depth
[25:09] of the statements that this Prophet is
[25:11] making listen what he's saying the
[25:13] exposition church he said see in John
[25:16] 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and
[25:19] dwelt Among Us and the Very substance of
[25:22] God was made flesh see the great spirit
[25:25] God under which no man could approach
[25:28] which which no man see no fatherhood
[25:30] could be given there watch what he says
[25:32] the great spirit God Amen no man could
[25:34] approach which no man had seen or could
[25:37] behold is now tabernacled in the flesh
[25:40] and dwelt among men expressing the
[25:43] fullness of God to man that's why in
[25:45] John 1:18 he said no man has seen him at
[25:48] any time the only begotten which is in
[25:51] the bosom of the father ha declared him
[25:54] that's why the scripture says he's in
[25:56] the bosom of the father and hath
[25:58] declared him who God on occasions would
[26:01] manifest his presence by The Cloud of
[26:03] the pillar of fire struck fear in the
[26:05] hearts of man but this God whose heart
[26:08] characteristics was made known only by
[26:10] the revelation of words through prophets
[26:12] listen now it's only made known by the
[26:15] revelation of the word through prophets
[26:19] fatherhood is only expressed through son
[26:22] of man look what he's saying it's made
[26:24] through the prophets now he became
[26:26] Emmanuel God With Us declaring and the
[26:29] word declare is taken from the Greek
[26:32] word often interpreted see which means
[26:35] to thoroughly explain and make clear
[26:38] that it is the Living Word Jesus did he
[26:42] brought God to us for he was God he
[26:46] brought God to us for he was God now
[26:50] what are we looking at we're looking at
[26:51] expression see he revealed God to us so
[26:55] perfectly in Clarity that John could say
[26:58] say that which was from the beginning
[27:00] which we have heard see which we have
[27:03] seen with our eyes which we have looked
[27:05] upon with our hands we have handled the
[27:07] word of life for life was manifested and
[27:11] we seen it glory be to God John what a
[27:14] revelation that which for us from the
[27:16] beginning has declared itself and we
[27:19] have seen it and we have believed it
[27:22] that's why John said I declare unto you
[27:24] the things which I have seen and heard
[27:26] Amen in the beginning watch the word and
[27:28] the Word was with God and the Word was
[27:31] God and the word became flesh and
[27:33] expressed the grace and the and the
[27:36] realities of fatherhood to the Church of
[27:38] the Living God at which we had heard
[27:40] from the beginning we seen it with our
[27:42] eyes amen and we looked upon it the word
[27:45] of life for life was manifested we have
[27:48] seen it and show unto you eternal life
[27:50] which was with the father and was
[27:53] manifested unto us I think these are
[27:55] powerful statements which we have seen
[27:57] and heard declare unto you that also we
[28:00] may have fellowship with us for truly
[28:03] our
[28:04] fellowship is with the father and with
[28:08] his son Jesus Christ when God was truly
[28:11] revealed he was manifested in the flesh
[28:15] and he that hath seen
[28:17] me ha seen the
[28:19] father oh
[28:22] my now in John the 14th chapter let's
[28:25] just read it together and I I pray you
[28:26] just bear with me a moment in this in
[28:29] this Foundation here it's a I I am going
[28:31] somewhere in John 14 And1 now we're
[28:34] looking at
[28:36] fatherhood can only be expressed as the
[28:40] son of
[28:42] man now Jesus is the expression of God
[28:47] and John 14 And1 let not your heart be
[28:49] troubled you believed in God believe
[28:52] also in
[28:54] me and In My Father's House of many
[28:56] mansions and if we're not so would not
[28:58] have told you I go to prepare a place
[29:00] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[29:02] for you I will come again and receive
[29:04] you unto myself that where I am there ye
[29:08] may be also and whether I go you know
[29:10] and the way you know and Thomas said
[29:12] unto him Lord we know not whether thou
[29:15] goest and how can we know the way and
[29:18] Jesus said unto him I am the way the
[29:20] truth and the life and no man cometh
[29:22] unto the father but by me and if you had
[29:25] known me you should have known my father
[29:27] also so and henceforth ye know him and
[29:32] have seen him isn't that powerful Jesus
[29:37] is so expressing the father that he said
[29:40] from henceforth you know him and ye have
[29:44] seen him and Philip saith unto him Lord
[29:47] show us the father now there's there's
[29:49] probably be a good 20 sermons brother BR
[29:51] preached on this show us the father and
[29:54] it suffices us and Jesus said unto him
[29:57] have I been so long time with you and
[30:00] yet thou Hast not known me Phillip and
[30:03] he that has seen the father when he has
[30:05] seen me have seen the father then how
[30:08] saith then show us the father believest
[30:11] thou not that I am in the father and the
[30:14] father in me and the words that I speak
[30:16] unto you now you got to hear this real
[30:18] clearly is everybody with me and the
[30:21] words that I speak now remember my Title
[30:24] Here Washed by the father's word and The
[30:26] Words which I speak unto you I speak not
[30:30] of
[30:31] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[30:35] me he doeth The Works the words you are
[30:40] hearing are not my words they are my
[30:44] father's words but he could only express
[30:47] them through the son of man and I tell
[30:49] you we ought to take a shou and fit for
[30:51] a little while amen The Words which I
[30:53] speak unto you they are not my words I I
[30:57] did they wasn't B born in a in a in a
[30:59] school somewhere there wasn't birthed in
[31:01] intellectualism somewhere but the
[31:04] creative logos almighty God took on a
[31:07] body and was speaking to a Congregation
[31:10] of his disciples and he was saying to
[31:12] them the words that I speak unto you I
[31:15] speak not of
[31:17] myself but they are my fathers and if
[31:21] you believe me that I am in the father
[31:22] and the father in me or else believe me
[31:24] for the very Works sake now what it it's
[31:28] a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
[31:29] thought now as we continue Jesus and
[31:32] things that are to be brother Bram says
[31:34] it like this now don't let your heart be
[31:35] troubled he said now you believe God
[31:37] believe also in me as you have believed
[31:39] in God believed me in other words as you
[31:41] have believed the father believe
[31:43] me because I am the Son of God and God
[31:50] now that's a powerful quote you you want
[31:52] to write that down I never heard anybody
[31:53] read that quote like that because I I
[31:55] don't but I'm sure somebody has but I
[31:58] just caught it amen uh the other the
[32:00] other evening look what he says because
[32:02] I am the Son of God see and
[32:08] God I am the Son of God and God see now
[32:15] I'm telling you that because we're
[32:16] living in a region where everybody was
[32:18] they they make such a big deal about him
[32:19] being the Son of God but they can't
[32:21] never say he is
[32:23] God but let me read this to you again I
[32:26] am the son of God and
[32:29] God in other words I and my father are
[32:34] one see amen my father is dwelling in me
[32:39] and what you see do I'm doing it's not
[32:42] me it's my father that dwelleth in me he
[32:46] doeth The Works Hallelujah Hallelujah
[32:50] Jesus was telling them I'm only a
[32:53] channel the word is working through and
[32:56] the word is my father father and when
[32:58] you see my Works you've not seen my
[33:01] Works you've seen his works when you've
[33:03] heard my voice you didn't hear my voice
[33:05] you heard his voice now watch what he
[33:07] says cuz in John 5: 19 Jesus answers
[33:11] this of course there was a lot of
[33:12] disturbance over him healing only one
[33:14] man out of a great Congregation of
[33:16] people and when they when they did they
[33:19] questioned him he answered and said unto
[33:21] them verily I say unto you the son can
[33:23] do nothing of himself now do we believe
[33:26] that the son can do nothing of himself
[33:30] but what he seeth the father do Now
[33:32] whats so things soever he doeth these
[33:34] also doeth the son likewise now brother
[33:37] random says in other words he done it by
[33:41] Vision verily I say unto you the son
[33:43] done nothing he sees the father doeth
[33:45] son like it was he that saw the father
[33:49] doing in other words he saw it by Vision
[33:52] what was about to happen in the second
[33:55] coming brother brandom says it like this
[33:57] the Lord Jesus Jesus came down and give
[33:58] P people power to heal the sick but I
[34:00] don't think he ever did this see see I
[34:03] would like to see our lord Jesus come
[34:05] down and give power to people to heal
[34:06] the sick but I don't think he ever did
[34:08] this even himself didn't claim to do it
[34:13] see he never did it anything he said
[34:15] himself that he wasn't a Healer he said
[34:18] it's not me that doeth the
[34:22] works it's my father he's the one that
[34:26] tells you see I can do nothing of myself
[34:29] but I see the father doing in other
[34:31] words he acted just a drama what the
[34:34] father showed him to do and that's the
[34:36] way it is now my goodness so here we're
[34:39] going to our precious Lord Jesus and
[34:42] we're looking at the son of man Ministry
[34:46] and we hear him saying I'm not the
[34:48] Healer I'm only doing what I see with my
[34:51] father it's not my words it's my
[34:54] father's words it's not my works it's my
[34:56] father's works because God loves
[34:59] fatherhood and the only way he could
[35:02] express being father was through the son
[35:05] of man I tell you it's a powerful thing
[35:08] now because the son can do nothing in
[35:10] himself but what he sees the father
[35:12] brother R said Jesus never claim to be a
[35:14] Healer it's not me that doeth the works
[35:17] it's my Father which dwelleth in me that
[35:19] doeth the works he shows me what to do
[35:22] by
[35:23] Vision Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[35:25] and forever he goes into it again Jesus
[35:28] never claimed to be a Healer how many
[35:29] knows that Jesus said the son can do
[35:32] nothing see it's not me that doeth the
[35:34] works it's my Father which doeth the
[35:36] works and he the son can do nothing but
[35:40] what the father sees him doing see that
[35:42] son doeth likewise now is that the truth
[35:45] I'm I'm asking Prophet ask it could the
[35:48] Son of God lie no sir that's true then
[35:53] Jesus never performed one Miracle
[35:55] without God showing him first what to do
[35:59] isn't it amazing people today say well
[36:00] if you're really an adopted son go out
[36:02] here and raise all the dead Jesus didn't
[36:04] do
[36:06] that Moses didn't do it Enoch didn't do
[36:09] it Elijah didn't do it no man of God
[36:12] ever operated outside of the will of God
[36:16] that's why the Holy Ghost was given to
[36:18] the church was to continue the work of
[36:21] God not the work of man this is not my
[36:24] work come on Church true word Tabernacle
[36:27] is not not brother Ray's work it's not
[36:28] brother Wayne's work this is God's work
[36:32] this is God's work you see what it is he
[36:35] uses a vessel but it's God working
[36:38] through the vessel amen it can't be
[36:41] can't can't come up here and say look
[36:42] how wonderful my Ministry no if you have
[36:44] any Ministry brother Bram said it's you
[36:46] got out of the way if there's any gift
[36:49] it's you got out of the way and the
[36:51] greater the meeting is because it was
[36:53] the greater of a surrender amen because
[36:55] there is a Resurrected choss God that's
[36:58] in the midst of the church trying to
[37:00] work in the church and I say god let's
[37:03] open the doors and give him room to work
[37:06] cuz he's a real reality is the
[37:08] fatherhood of God now if you go to the
[37:10] Bible again in John 10 and verse 24
[37:13] let's read then Jews came around about
[37:15] him and they said how long do you make
[37:17] us doubt if thou be the Christ tell us
[37:19] plainly and Jesus said I told you and
[37:21] you believe me not the works that I do
[37:24] in my father's name they bear witness of
[37:26] me but if if you believe not because you
[37:29] are not my sheep as I have said unto you
[37:32] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[37:35] and they follow me he's talking about
[37:37] his
[37:38] children now my children will recognize
[37:43] me now in John 10:28 and I've give unto
[37:47] them eternal life and they shall never
[37:50] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[37:55] out of my hand oh brother I wished I had
[37:58] an hour on that
[37:59] scripture amen and I give unto them
[38:03] eternal life offspring of God comes from
[38:07] the source of God if you have human life
[38:10] you had a human father but my father is
[38:13] not just Randall Lawson amen I have a
[38:16] heavenly father and that father has a
[38:19] spiritual life it's called eternal life
[38:21] and Eternity never began nor can it end
[38:25] and he that hath gave un to us eternal
[38:28] life no man can pluck you out of his
[38:31] hand listen I tell you what we are to
[38:33] get in a reality Our Father brought
[38:35] security to the house didn't he Our
[38:37] Father brought security to the house the
[38:39] son of man brought security to the
[38:42] church he didn't put us on one day with
[38:45] him one day you're out one day you're up
[38:46] one day you're down that wasn't what our
[38:48] father did our father spoke words to the
[38:51] son of man to say to you that I have
[38:54] given unto you eternal life and no man
[38:58] no man can pluck you out of my hand let
[39:00] me ask you who is greater than my father
[39:03] who is greater than my father amen you
[39:05] say well sin abounds and I say grace
[39:07] abound much more amen amen there's
[39:10] nothing that can pluck you out of the
[39:12] hand of God when God gives you eternal
[39:14] life amen you are saved for Time and
[39:18] Eternity Hallelujah I'm talking about
[39:21] security by the son of man amen that's
[39:25] why when they were on that rocking boat
[39:27] brother Jeremy they were just as secure
[39:29] as sitting in their living rooms because
[39:32] the son of man fatherhood was being
[39:35] expressed in the middle of the storm
[39:38] there is a
[39:41] security he's in the
[39:44] boat
[39:46] Hallelujah my goodness I was thinking
[39:48] this morning amen with the scripture
[39:50] said I'll be a father to the fatherless
[39:52] I said oh dear God have you not been
[39:55] amen how the holy Spirit would come and
[39:59] how that he would do it see nothing
[40:01] could separate you I always love it when
[40:04] I look at these scriptures because
[40:06] here's the thing nothing shall pluck you
[40:08] out of my hand that's a pretty
[40:10] determined statement isn't it in other
[40:12] words as one who knows the future how
[40:15] could you say nothing shall pluck you
[40:17] out of my hand unless you knew the
[40:19] future amen of the seed you're talking
[40:21] about cuz you could say well nothing has
[40:24] plucked you out of my hand that would be
[40:26] one thing nothing has amen but he said
[40:28] nothing will so this is the god that
[40:32] controls the future can I say this
[40:34] fatherhood expressed in son of man can
[40:37] tell you about tomorrow he can tell you
[40:39] about the next day listen we're sitting
[40:42] here right now with Russia down there in

[41:14] know what they done in that G7 Summit
[41:16] you know what they did they took $50
[41:19] billion that they had blocked from

[41:25] and the and the European governments
[41:27] have took money away from them and I
[41:29] forget what they call it it's like an
[41:31] embargo but it's not the right word
[41:33] sanctions they put sanctions on the
[41:35] Russian Millionaires and billionaires
[41:37] and they have just loaned Ukraine $50
[41:41] billion do of Russian money to throw
[41:44] bombs at

[42:24] don't have to build the bomb they don't

[43:28] there's aund ways I could prove it but
[43:29] the best way I ever saw was when

[43:33] bram's meetings the son of man Ministry
[43:37] told him why he was hurt said you fell
[43:39] off of a wagon as a young child and this

[44:41] amen that he's climbed upon on the heot
[44:44] and he watches over the sparrow he
[44:46] watches over you and
[44:50] me do you see there's chords of Prophecy
[44:52] connected to your life that Satan will
[44:55] never be able to break those bands right
[44:57] my father gave them and he is greater
[44:59] than all and no man is able to pluck
[45:01] them out of my father's hand John 10:30
[45:04] says it again I and my father are one
[45:08] then that's when the Jews took stones to
[45:10] Stone him and they answered and said
[45:12] many good works have I showed you of my
[45:14] father from which of these Works do you
[45:16] Stone me and the Jews answered saying
[45:19] for a good work we Stone thee not but
[45:21] for
[45:23] blasphemy and because thou being a man
[45:26] make thyself God and Jesus answered and
[45:30] said it is not written in your
[45:32] law is it not written in your
[45:35] law now if you study brother Bram this
[45:38] is a powerful point and if you if you
[45:40] take it home you can read it Jesus
[45:42] answered and said unto them is it not
[45:44] written in your law he said there's the
[45:46] son and he said I said ye are Gods he
[45:50] said there's the
[45:52] father Jesus same voice same ey
[45:57] audience he says is it not written in
[46:00] your law he said there's the son
[46:01] speaking and then I said he said there's
[46:05] the father
[46:06] speaking come on it's Jesus Christ same
[46:09] yesterday and forever brother Ram makes
[46:10] a point out of it that's why when you're
[46:12] listening to a Kentucky hillbilly
[46:14] William
[46:15] brandom come on you got to be able to
[46:18] discern you got to be able to divide the
[46:21] word of
[46:25] God I know there's a bunch bunch of
[46:27] Fanatics went way Wild on all that stuff
[46:29] but we can't help what what what has
[46:30] been and done it's but it's the truth
[46:33] see and he called them gods and who the
[46:36] word of God came to and scripture cannot
[46:37] be broken say ye of him whom the father
[46:40] have Sanctified and I sent into the
[46:41] world thou blasphemist because I said
[46:44] I'm the Son of God but if I do not the
[46:46] works of my father then don't believe me
[46:48] but if I do though you believe me not
[46:50] believe the works that you may know and
[46:53] believe that the father is in me
[46:56] and I am in him now watch this 10th
[47:00] verse of John 14 believest no thou not
[47:04] that I am in the Father the father of me
[47:05] the words I speak I speak not of myself
[47:07] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[47:10] doeth The Works see what is happening
[47:13] here is Jesus even asked them to search
[47:16] the
[47:17] scriptures now he didn't tell them go
[47:19] home and get your tradition books out
[47:20] and see if this was going to happen you
[47:23] go home get your get your Methodist um
[47:25] Creed books out and see if this is going
[47:27] to take place that wasn't what he said
[47:30] he said search the
[47:32] scriptures for in them you claim to have
[47:35] eternal life and they are the ones that
[47:38] speak of
[47:39] me see you will not come to me that you
[47:43] may have life John 40 541 for I receive
[47:45] not the honor of man but I know and that
[47:48] you have not the love of God in you I am
[47:50] coming my father's name and you receive
[47:52] me not now if another shall come in his
[47:54] own name you will receive him do you see
[47:56] that
[47:57] denomination coming in his own name in
[48:01] the name of blasphemy they have an idea
[48:03] they're coming in his own name and
[48:05] people are receiving
[48:07] that but it's not my father
[48:12] speaking now you'll get to it later
[48:15] remember this there's Apostolic
[48:17] fathers right the church has Apostolic
[48:20] fathers and they have fathers of the Nan
[48:25] Council so there is a fatherhood to the
[48:29] church and either it is an Apostolic
[48:32] fatherhood or it's an ican counsel
[48:36] fatherhood now watch this because you
[48:39] see Jesus Jesus speaking here and he's
[48:42] letting them know that his works are
[48:45] testifying that I and my father are one
[48:47] if you turn me down you turned him down
[48:50] he's letting them know and watch and
[48:51] show us the father brother B said see
[48:53] John 14:8 said I am I am the father and
[48:56] I are one see the father dwelleth in me
[48:58] he doeth The Works my father he doeth
[49:01] The Works see the son can do nothing see
[49:05] it was God was in Christ reconciling the
[49:08] world to himself now I'm going to read
[49:11] you a couple quotes here and I think
[49:12] they're so powerful but let's give them
[49:14] let's give them some advancement into
[49:16] our age spiritual food and due season
[49:18] brother bam speaking here he says now
[49:21] watch he didn't stop him he went right
[49:23] on performing and carrying on his duty
[49:26] and God can confirming everything he
[49:27] done he said I'm not by
[49:31] myself my father and I are one he dwells
[49:34] with me it ain't me that doeth the works
[49:37] it's the father that dwelleth in me
[49:40] listen to what he says I'm not by
[49:43] myself now you're looking at the man and
[49:45] you're thinking he's by himself but he
[49:48] said I'm not by myself I am my father
[49:50] are one so well me and my wife are one
[49:52] brother BR said it's a different kind of
[49:54] one he said I I can see you and I can
[49:57] see your wife it's you're one but you're
[49:59] two different people he said but when
[50:01] you're looking at Jesus he said they're
[50:03] one he said you're looking at God in his
[50:06] Tabernacle they are one person they're
[50:09] not two
[50:11] people it's one person but father God
[50:14] could not express himself unless he was
[50:17] in the son of man
[50:19] office hey man watch this the father
[50:22] these are powerful quotes some of you
[50:24] that study these areas you'll love this
[50:25] quote and and John uh in in Rising of
[50:28] the sun he said who condemn me of sin
[50:30] now whatever God wrote and whatever the
[50:33] prophet said I'm the answer see what
[50:36] they said I do he came as a prophet the
[50:39] son of man and he proved it see the
[50:41] Dynamics was there to fire off the
[50:45] mechanics he was the mechanics the son
[50:49] himself and the father was the
[50:53] Dynamics Oh Glory to God Amen it's not
[50:56] me that doeth the works it's my father
[50:59] that dwelleth in me and he splatters
[51:02] forth the Dynamics and makes the thing
[51:05] come to pass Hallelujah church amen I
[51:09] tell you it's a powerful thing when you
[51:10] can see what was doing the work in Jesus
[51:13] Christ he was saying it's not me it's
[51:15] the Dynamics it's the father that
[51:18] dwelleth in me brother BR said there's
[51:20] the real power of God riseing the sun
[51:22] you can do nothing without me see and he
[51:25] is the word it's the father and father
[51:27] sent me so send I you he fired me and
[51:30] pushed me into
[51:32] everything as the father sent me so send
[51:35] I you he fired me and pushed me into
[51:39] doing I did only that which was pleasing
[51:42] he sent me and so send I you with the
[51:45] same mechanics and it takes the Dynamics
[51:49] to operate it amen when you see that the
[51:52] father is the mechanics of the Dynamics
[51:54] to the mechanics of the word look at
[51:57] this Jesus says in Awakening Jesus
[51:59] brother B said it like this he said his
[52:01] body sets tonight as a sacrifice in
[52:03] heaven now let we got to get real clear
[52:06] there is a Corporal body of Jesus Christ
[52:08] how many believes that with me what good
[52:11] is there in Eve without an Adam there is
[52:14] a Corporal body of Jesus Christ but that
[52:16] body is not here tonight this morning
[52:18] it's in another dimension and according
[52:20] to the prophet of God it sets in heaven
[52:22] tonight this morning that body cannot
[52:25] come to this Earth see he but it's his
[52:29] life that
[52:31] returns that body cannot come but it's
[52:35] his life that comes what was his life it
[52:39] was
[52:40] father see it's father that is coming Oh
[52:43] Glory to God I feel like I just tear the
[52:45] the walls off of this building this
[52:47] morning amen it's the father that was
[52:49] coming it was the Dynamics that was
[52:51] coming the Dynamics of this word is the
[52:55] same life that was operating in Jesus
[52:58] Christ Hallelujah that's what it was and
[53:01] it's come back upon the church in the
[53:04] form of the Holy Spirit it wasn't the
[53:07] body that did it
[53:12] anyhow it wasn't the I tell you what
[53:15] when Jesus comes we're going to have
[53:17] this and when Jesus comes we're going to
[53:19] have this and brother BR says I'm not
[53:21] saying that sacriligious I'm saying
[53:23] people are putting the Revival in the
[53:25] future of his Corporal body and brother
[53:28] B said it wasn't his body that did
[53:32] it it's not me that doeth the works it's
[53:36] my father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[53:40] the works I tell you it was the spirit
[53:43] of Christ that was doing them works and
[53:45] that same one is the father again has
[53:49] returned in this age to claim the
[53:51] sunship and the attributes of almighty
[53:54] God how will you know you're a son in
[53:57] this age unless the father comes down to
[54:00] identify you and let you know you're a
[54:04] son hallelujah amen what is it the
[54:07] return Jesus said I come from God I
[54:09] return to God I came from the father I'm
[54:12] going back to the father and then Paul
[54:15] met him on the road and it was a pillar
[54:19] of fire he called that God fatherhood
[54:22] and he said what is your name my name is
[54:25] Jesus then the father and the son has
[54:28] the same name glory be to
[54:32] God I know I can't preach all these
[54:34] points man I want
[54:36] to
[54:37] Hallelujah do you see what it was it was
[54:40] father and he was manifesting himself in
[54:42] a pillar of fire but what he did was he
[54:45] got into that body and began to express
[54:48] himself the word of God it identified
[54:51] him and the word of God identify you as
[54:54] well you see now watch they believe me
[54:57] for the works for they are the
[54:59] manifested Word of Promise oh my
[55:03] goodness amen now here it is it's the
[55:05] father that dwelleth in you he's the one
[55:09] that does the
[55:11] speaking now here's the
[55:13] thing Jesus in John 14 in the third
[55:17] verse look what he says if I go and
[55:22] prepare a place for
[55:23] you I will come again
[55:27] and receive you unto myself that where I
[55:29] am there ye may be also now I I I y'
[55:34] y'all forgive me but I I sometimes pay
[55:36] real close attention to detail in these
[55:40] scriptures and and and it's
[55:42] beautiful that he said I
[55:45] go but the same one that said I go said
[55:50] I
[55:51] come now that's not two different ones
[55:54] it's the same one it's not me that
[55:57] speaketh but my father that speaketh my
[56:00] words are not my words but I'm going to
[56:03] go and I'm going to
[56:05] come you say preacher you you lost your
[56:08] mind knowing Matthew 24 Jesus's own
[56:10] words he prophesies a place for himself
[56:14] and says as the lightning Cometh From
[56:17] the East and shineth to the West so
[56:19] shall also the coming of the son of man
[56:23] be I come I go I come and the son of man
[56:27] shall come in the last days is that
[56:30] right now you read it from Luke 17 and
[56:32] it'll say this even thus shall it be in
[56:34] the day when the son of man is
[56:38] revealed so the revealing of the son of
[56:41] man and the coming of the son of man are
[56:43] the same
[56:45] thing it's the same thing
[56:48] folks I will come but then I will I will
[56:51] come and receive you unto myself
[56:57] now father is going to
[57:00] return and
[57:02] speak that's amazing to me personally
[57:06] that in first Timothy he says I will
[57:07] show you in times past who is the
[57:10] blessed and only potentate king of kings
[57:12] and he's the Lord of lords who hath
[57:14] immortality dwelling in light which no
[57:16] man can approach and no man seeing to
[57:19] him honor and power forever which in
[57:21] times P 1 Timothy 6:15 that he will show
[57:26] who is the only so that will come a time
[57:29] that he will reveal
[57:31] himself father will reveal himself again
[57:37] the only way he can express himself is
[57:40] through son of
[57:43] man now now this then and and I I got to
[57:48] hurry so you you can stay with me here
[57:50] real quickly watch this then brings in
[57:54] the idea of prophetic Ministry in the
[57:57] end time if you if you're a studier of
[58:00] scripture you'll know that the scripture
[58:02] tells us that the heavens must receive
[58:04] Jesus until the
[58:06] restitution of all things right so then
[58:09] we know there got to come a restitution
[58:11] to the church or a restoration of the
[58:14] word which they had lost has got to be
[58:17] restored now if you're a Bible reader
[58:19] you'll find that in Revelations the 10th
[58:21] chapter the first verse down to the
[58:23] 7eventh it'll tell us that a mighty
[58:25] angel will come come out of heaven and
[58:27] he will descend with an open book and
[58:29] when he does John was going to write it
[58:32] but there was a voice that John don't
[58:34] write it but seal it until the seventh
[58:38] angel begins to
[58:39] sound when the seventh angel begins to
[58:42] speak if the word if the book The Angel
[58:45] was bringing was the word then that
[58:48] seventh angel would have to be a
[58:51] prophet right if you go back in the
[58:54] scripture now the word only comes to a
[58:56] prophet Amos chapter 3 now if that word
[58:59] is coming to a prophet then there's got
[59:02] to be prophecy of a prophet coming in
[59:04] the end time then you go directly to
[59:07] Malachi the 4th chapter and the Bible
[59:09] said behold I send unto you Elijah
[59:13] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[59:15] Lord that's the fourth coming of Elijah
[59:17] so it's the spirit of Elijah using a man
[59:21] I don't know how to preach this quickly
[59:23] but y'all got to you you I know how many
[59:25] of you believe this so you got to really
[59:26] get in agreement with it and and and and
[59:29] just just go ahead and say Amen to it
[59:31] because it's the spirit of Elijah in a
[59:34] man is that right it's not Elijah
[59:37] himself that was only one time Elijah
[59:39] himself was on the Earth right and then
[59:41] it was the spirit of Elijah in Elisha
[59:44] and then it was the spirit of Elijah in
[59:46] John the Baptist but then in 1933
[59:49] William brandham stood under the pillar
[59:51] of fire and Heard a Voice say as John
[59:53] the Baptist forun the first coming I'll
[59:56] give you a message and you'll forerun
[59:59] the second coming is that right then the
[1:00:02] spirit that was in John the Baptist
[1:00:04] would be in a man in the end time his
[1:00:06] name was William brandom he was a
[1:00:08] Kentucky hillbilly but that's not the
[1:00:10] important part the important part is who
[1:00:13] is it that was going to be using him to
[1:00:18] speak a prophet don't become a prophet a
[1:00:21] prophet is Born the prophet that's why
[1:00:24] he begin to see Visions even before
[1:00:26] before he knew the attribute of
[1:00:27] fatherhood but then when that Pillar of
[1:00:29] Fire began to came to him he began to
[1:00:32] understand behold I send unto you Elijah
[1:00:33] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:00:35] Lord and he would turn the heart of
[1:00:37] children back to
[1:00:40] Father Oh Glory to God he's going to
[1:00:43] turn these people to the word of God
[1:00:45] he's going to turn them back to the word
[1:00:47] of God back to the father what is it now
[1:00:50] see now watch brother Brandon will tell
[1:00:52] you very clearly but the Elijah of this
[1:00:54] day is the Lord Jesus
[1:00:57] Christ now he has come according to
[1:01:00] Matthew and Luke the son of man is to be
[1:01:03] revealed not a man God but it come
[1:01:07] through a
[1:01:08] prophet God but it came through a
[1:01:11] prophet that's the part that's killing
[1:01:14] people it came through a prophet they
[1:01:16] let the veil get in the way every time
[1:01:19] but listen if you would just get the
[1:01:20] veil out of the way you would see that
[1:01:23] it's father and he's come to secure Ure
[1:01:26] and provide and give this church
[1:01:28] everything that's in his mind Hallelujah
[1:01:31] he's going to come and show himself now
[1:01:34] now if you if you're a if you're a
[1:01:35] follower of the message of the hour and
[1:01:37] if you're just beginning these are
[1:01:38] important points to you especially this
[1:01:40] one because there's people that tried to
[1:01:42] make brother brandom deity and they've
[1:01:44] rode that horse till they have made a a
[1:01:46] very reproach out of the message of the
[1:01:48] hour and the prophet of God said I never
[1:01:51] came to do that at all is that right and
[1:01:55] he even go as far as to say when that
[1:01:57] Pillar of Fire came down on that River
[1:02:00] he said he appeared on that River and I
[1:02:02] was only standing there when he
[1:02:05] appeared amen he makes the distinction
[1:02:07] to tell you I am not the one that
[1:02:10] performs these things or do I pel these
[1:02:13] things as perfect as they are I'm only
[1:02:16] near when he does it I was only a voice
[1:02:19] that he used it wasn't what I knew it's
[1:02:23] what I surrendered to it spoke through
[1:02:25] me it isn't me it wasn't the seventh
[1:02:28] angel it was the manifestation of the
[1:02:31] son of man it it was the manifestation
[1:02:34] of the son of man it's fatherhood
[1:02:37] expressing to an age it was the
[1:02:40] manifestation it wasn't the angel his
[1:02:43] message it's the mystery that God
[1:02:44] unfolded it's not a man it's God and
[1:02:47] this Angel was not the son of man he was
[1:02:50] a messenger from the son of man the son
[1:02:54] of man is Christ he's the one you're
[1:02:56] feeding on you're not feeding on a man
[1:02:59] watch's this what does a fatherhood do
[1:03:01] he gives food to the household he brings
[1:03:04] bread to the table he brings sustaining
[1:03:07] life a father would do this he said
[1:03:10] you're not feeding on me I'm not the one
[1:03:13] feeding you you're feeding on the
[1:03:15] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:03:18] father has brought a table full a seven
[1:03:21] course meal has been set out before you
[1:03:24] the Seven Seals have opened up amen did
[1:03:26] William brandom open them seals I say he
[1:03:29] didn't I say Revelation 5 said only the
[1:03:32] lamb could open that book and I say
[1:03:34] brother brandom got it the same time you
[1:03:36] got it but God brought it to a prophet
[1:03:39] to bring it to the people because father
[1:03:42] can only express himself through son of
[1:03:46] man somebody T take the office of son of
[1:03:49] man out of the church you know what
[1:03:50] they've done they've robbed you of every
[1:03:52] benefit they've robbed you of every
[1:03:54] nourishment they've robbed you of every
[1:03:56] security they've robbed you of Revival
[1:03:59] because they have taken father's words
[1:04:01] out of the
[1:04:05] church I'll tell you again and again
[1:04:07] brother Bram said it's not my
[1:04:10] voice it's not me I don't have
[1:04:14] control I do not it speaks
[1:04:19] itself it's my voice and I'm listening
[1:04:23] to myself talk
[1:04:26] just as you're listening to me
[1:04:29] talk Hallelujah can you imagine if
[1:04:31] brother Bram could have stood out of his
[1:04:33] body he was listening to himself talk
[1:04:36] like you listening to me talk he didn't
[1:04:38] know what was going to be coming out of
[1:04:40] his mouth folks the office of a prophet
[1:04:43] is an office of
[1:04:45] God the man William brandham was not the
[1:04:48] son of man he was a son of man revealing
[1:04:53] the son of man
[1:04:55] oh my you heard me tell you something
[1:04:58] didn't you that was not my voice but it
[1:05:01] was not me it was my voice but it wasn't
[1:05:03] me operating it it's a supernatural
[1:05:07] being now here's the thing looking unto
[1:05:10] the Unseen these are important things
[1:05:12] for us to catch as a
[1:05:14] believer in looking to the Unseen he
[1:05:16] said I'm the Lord that raised up Christ
[1:05:19] from the
[1:05:19] grave I'm the one that sent the Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost I'm the one that gave the promise
[1:05:26] brother brandham has nothing to do in
[1:05:31] this do you think that voice lied come
[1:05:35] on Church Jesus said I don't do the
[1:05:39] works brother Brams the voice is
[1:05:41] speaking through him the same voice that
[1:05:44] spoke through our Lord spoke through
[1:05:46] this man and said it's not we Bram doing
[1:05:49] these things but it's the lord it's the
[1:05:52] one that raised up from the dead listen
[1:05:54] what he done he borrow a body and spoke
[1:05:57] to this church that you might have
[1:05:59] security that you might hear from heaven
[1:06:02] when the Prophet come down and said thus
[1:06:05] saith the Lord amen what does that mean
[1:06:08] lordship a household a father thus saith
[1:06:11] my father not my
[1:06:13] mother I'll tell you that's shout
[1:06:15] material right there it's not my church
[1:06:19] it's not thus saith my church it's thus
[1:06:22] saith my father the father of this house
[1:06:25] has spoken
[1:06:26] through the message of the
[1:06:30] hour I've got I've got a bunch of quotes
[1:06:32] I'm going to have to get through them
[1:06:33] quickly but I'm going to skip over them
[1:06:35] quickly for your time sake but you
[1:06:38] believe me that I am in him he that he
[1:06:40] is him speaking not me he's speaking
[1:06:43] through me then if it be his voice
[1:06:44] speaking through me then his presence is
[1:06:50] here now listen what he's
[1:06:53] doing he's telling you here his presence
[1:06:57] is here now if you wouldn't had that
[1:06:59] Prophet standing there father could have
[1:07:02] never expressed that to the
[1:07:05] church the same as your favorite
[1:07:07] television program could be playing but
[1:07:09] without a TV You' never see it the
[1:07:12] favorite radio station could be playing
[1:07:14] but without a radio you'd never hear it
[1:07:17] and father was sending things to the
[1:07:19] Earth but without a prophet you would
[1:07:22] never know he did it because fatherhood
[1:07:24] is expressed through the son of man
[1:07:27] hallelujah how is he going to get to the
[1:07:29] church he's going to operate through the
[1:07:32] channel of a prophet let's just say this
[1:07:35] you say well I want something uh brother
[1:07:37] Greg be is a supply house and I want
[1:07:39] Plumbing he's my
[1:07:41] channel that's the channel to get what I
[1:07:44] need that's a channel you I don't want
[1:07:46] to use salesman well maybe it's getting
[1:07:48] to the place now where you don't have to
[1:07:49] I don't know but let's just use it for
[1:07:51] for simple
[1:07:52] sake you get things through the sales
[1:07:57] he don't produce
[1:07:59] them he don't stock them but he handles
[1:08:04] them and he is a channel whereby things
[1:08:07] flow through him to the person who has
[1:08:09] need and a prophet is saying the words
[1:08:12] I'm speaking to you I didn't produce
[1:08:14] them I didn't operate them I didn't make
[1:08:17] them up I am just a channel and when you
[1:08:20] begin to pull it's not my voice you're
[1:08:23] hearing but you're pulling on a
[1:08:26] different vessel and then words begin to
[1:08:28] come to him because father was speaking
[1:08:31] through
[1:08:33] him Hallelujah you talk about a Father's
[1:08:36] Day you talk about a Father's Day I'm
[1:08:39] not talking about this marketing thing
[1:08:41] they're doing I'm talking about a
[1:08:42] Father's Day a day when my father has
[1:08:46] declared himself real among the Church
[1:08:49] of the Living God just as real as 2,000
[1:08:53] years ago he has returned
[1:08:55] [Applause]
[1:08:58] amen H now here's the thing you'll find
[1:09:03] this end time Seven Seals had to be
[1:09:05] unfolded and we can be brought down to a
[1:09:07] prophet we're looking for it and we
[1:09:09] believe his spirit is Among Us now watch
[1:09:13] when Jesus came he did prove to be the
[1:09:15] Messiah the anointed one the father had
[1:09:18] come down and dwelt in him in the form
[1:09:20] of a dove from Heaven saying this is my
[1:09:23] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:09:25] that's the reason he said I and my
[1:09:27] father are one see John bear a record of
[1:09:30] seeing that he's seen the Spirit come in
[1:09:33] to Jesus and he said I my father are one
[1:09:37] do you see that Abraham's Royal seed is
[1:09:40] to come in this end time as a royal
[1:09:42] bride seed is that right and just as
[1:09:47] Jesus was in Mary so was this bride seed
[1:09:50] in the Pentecostal age she was a seed
[1:09:53] hid in the husk just like brother random
[1:09:56] he he moved among all the denominations
[1:09:59] but he wasn't of that age he said I'm a
[1:10:01] man born of season and he was a seed
[1:10:04] laying in that shuck but when the seed
[1:10:07] begin to mature when the ripening of the
[1:10:10] sun when fatherhood begin to want to be
[1:10:12] expressed what happened amen that they
[1:10:14] pushed him right out of that and then
[1:10:17] the seed come out and when the seed uh I
[1:10:21] wish I had better words but I'll say it
[1:10:22] like this when a seed could express it
[1:10:25] itself without the covering of
[1:10:29] denomination to to to see that seed in
[1:10:32] the shuck you seen it partially
[1:10:35] unveiled but when the full maturity
[1:10:37] struck that seed when the hus pulled
[1:10:40] back you seen the real thing you seen
[1:10:43] the real seed and it's not until you get
[1:10:45] to the bright age do you really see the
[1:10:48] real Mind Of God coming down to the seed
[1:10:51] because it's making you move father is
[1:10:53] moving you
[1:10:56] now there's a lot of types there I'll
[1:10:57] get maybe to one of them later but watch
[1:10:59] this you find out the brother R said
[1:11:01] when the seed was delivered it said I
[1:11:03] come to do the will of my father there's
[1:11:05] that true seed see it comes at the
[1:11:08] opening of Seven Seals in Revelation 10
[1:11:11] the full word is to be born into
[1:11:14] manifestation now when this word is
[1:11:18] being birth now I don't and I say this
[1:11:22] because I want you to study it if I say
[1:11:23] I don't have time I really really do not
[1:11:24] have time to declare this but I'm going
[1:11:26] to say it and then you can study it but
[1:11:29] in Revelation 16 remember there's three
[1:11:31] unclean frogs and remember brother BR
[1:11:33] said they're looking backwards now when
[1:11:35] they look backwards brother Bram said
[1:11:37] here's what they're doing they have
[1:11:39] heard the opening of the
[1:11:41] seals and these ning children the
[1:11:44] children of the of the denomination are
[1:11:47] looking back to see what their Nan
[1:11:50] father said about
[1:11:52] it so when they look back to the I see a
[1:11:56] counsel they disbelieve the word that
[1:11:58] has come to them in the open of the
[1:12:00] seals but you see what it is we are not
[1:12:04] hearing what the Nan fathers said about
[1:12:06] it that's why you come in well Dr so-
[1:12:09] and so said this about it and Dr so- and
[1:12:11] so said this about it and those men are
[1:12:13] great students of the
[1:12:16] Bible but the Bible reads different
[1:12:19] after the son of man
[1:12:22] speaks it's a new book folks
[1:12:25] when I heard brother brandham read
[1:12:27] certain scriptures I had never heard
[1:12:28] that scripture before though I had read
[1:12:31] it a hundred times I had never heard it
[1:12:35] before but when a prophet took the
[1:12:37] scripture he brought the intended
[1:12:39] meaning of
[1:12:41] Father dear God that's why that it
[1:12:44] became headship over the family because
[1:12:47] it was spoken from the father's word now
[1:12:51] here's the thing you can see hey man
[1:12:53] that when these Seven Seals begin to
[1:12:55] open it begins to finish up see it
[1:12:58] begins to finish up time now Jesus
[1:13:01] himself said as the Lo living father has
[1:13:04] sent
[1:13:05] me so send I
[1:13:09] you now he was a living father right and
[1:13:14] how wonderful brother Bram said like a
[1:13:15] father that very birth of Eternity would
[1:13:18] come down to a mortal being and help us
[1:13:20] that he would bring his word and give it
[1:13:22] into our mouths and our hearts and our
[1:13:24] ears
[1:13:25] that we might hear it and live now to
[1:13:28] redeem us from a curse we had nothing to
[1:13:30] do with it
[1:13:33] coming now here's a prophet speaking to
[1:13:37] you as God's
[1:13:40] children to redeem us from a curse that
[1:13:42] we had nothing to do with it coming
[1:13:46] father because it was done by the human
[1:13:48] race and were offsprings of that first
[1:13:50] couple were born in sin shaped in
[1:13:52] iniquity but a just and a Living God
[1:13:56] knows we had nothing to do with that but
[1:13:59] thou has made a way of escape and gave
[1:14:02] us the privilege of coming and how glad
[1:14:05] we
[1:14:06] are to come to Father's
[1:14:09] house oh my how glad we are to come to
[1:14:15] Father's House what are we speaking of
[1:14:18] the father coming to the father's house
[1:14:21] now if you were if you were just
[1:14:22] speaking this morning on a Father's Love
[1:14:25] and and you take the the types and The
[1:14:27] Parables of scripture I don't know of a
[1:14:29] greater place in the Bible than Luke
[1:14:32] 15 because it tells The Parables
[1:14:34] remember the three Parables it tells
[1:14:35] they're all about something being lost
[1:14:38] and something being restored and when it
[1:14:41] gets down to the prodical sun it was in
[1:14:43] that and which has been preached
[1:14:44] hundreds of times all over the Earth but
[1:14:47] what it was speaking about is speaking
[1:14:49] about a son that had went far away but
[1:14:51] there's a greater there's a greater
[1:14:53] understanding in that in that there was
[1:14:56] someone amen that was ready for him to
[1:14:58] return listen and and if and if you go
[1:15:01] back in the deeps of these things amen
[1:15:03] when the prodical son left his father's
[1:15:05] house and he went in the foreign country
[1:15:06] and began to spend his his his living
[1:15:08] now what what this happened was is he
[1:15:11] actually ended up in a place of
[1:15:14] poverty because he was out of the
[1:15:16] father's house see he ended up in a
[1:15:18] place of the wrong company cuz he was
[1:15:20] out of Father's house he ended up do
[1:15:22] y'all know the Bible said he was about
[1:15:23] to eat with the swine the
[1:15:28] husk I hope you hear me the Pentecostal
[1:15:32] message he was in such a shape that he
[1:15:35] he was sitting there but in the middle
[1:15:38] of that what did the Bible say he came
[1:15:40] to
[1:15:43] himself he was in the middle of famine
[1:15:46] and he came to himself he was in the
[1:15:48] middle of desperation and he came to
[1:15:50] himself he was a long ways from home but
[1:15:53] he came to himself because he was an
[1:15:56] attribute he had a father and he knew he
[1:15:59] had a father oh Hallelujah if I got a
[1:16:03] father then I got a place to return to
[1:16:06] if I got a father somewhere my father
[1:16:10] will feed me I love how the band says
[1:16:12] I'll go home and I'll work for my father
[1:16:16] and I'll go home even the
[1:16:19] servants even the servants in My
[1:16:22] Father's House eat better than what I'm
[1:16:24] eating
[1:16:25] even the service oh Church of the Living
[1:16:28] God so he got it made up in his mind I'm
[1:16:31] going back to Daddy's house and I tell
[1:16:33] you I'm going to go back as a servant
[1:16:35] and that's the way a lot of you return
[1:16:36] to God that's the way you come into the
[1:16:39] message you see well I tell you what
[1:16:40] they live good and I see their lives and
[1:16:42] I see the blessings over them I'm just
[1:16:44] going to go down there and I'm going to
[1:16:45] just fit in I'm not going to do anything
[1:16:47] I'm not really going to I'm just going
[1:16:48] to enjoy the benefits of being a part of
[1:16:51] such an assembly amen but when but when
[1:16:53] you started home
[1:16:56] but when you started home the prophet
[1:16:58] said an angel appeared to your mama and
[1:17:01] said to your mama the boys on his way
[1:17:03] home amen isn't that what happened in
[1:17:06] this age an angel appeared unto a
[1:17:08] prophet and said the bride is returning
[1:17:11] and she's going to return in her former
[1:17:13] glory and while she was a long ways off
[1:17:16] Hallelujah while she wasn't yet bride
[1:17:19] while she was still in denomination
[1:17:21] there was a worldwide Revival father
[1:17:25] left his home and came to
[1:17:27] you right here in Lima Ohio father held
[1:17:31] some meetings he held them over in
[1:17:33] Jeffersonville held them in Chicago
[1:17:35] Illinois and you said well I tell you
[1:17:37] there were thousand together but
[1:17:38] sometimes it was just one
[1:17:41] person come on church he went to Chicago
[1:17:43] Illinois for one didn't he just for one
[1:17:46] person father went a long ways because
[1:17:50] there was a bride returning returning
[1:17:53] back home after so many
[1:17:57] years brother R I love it cuz you know
[1:17:59] he went and met
[1:18:01] him he went right out where they were
[1:18:04] and you know what he did as a father
[1:18:06] would do that boy returning with dirty
[1:18:09] clothes and and got no shoes on his feet
[1:18:11] y all know the types of that the filthy
[1:18:14] rags he's returning in his own
[1:18:16] righteousness he ain't wearing shoes you
[1:18:18] know why brother Greg cuz people don't
[1:18:19] wear shoes in those days were
[1:18:22] slaves amen and when the father saw him
[1:18:25] he said that ain't no slave coming over
[1:18:27] that Hill that's my attribute coming
[1:18:30] over that Hill that's my son coming over
[1:18:32] that hill and when fatherhood began to
[1:18:35] be expressed that's when he could not no
[1:18:38] longer stay a servant listen and when
[1:18:41] this message came that's why we can't be
[1:18:44] just a church we can't be just another
[1:18:47] church we're the adopted Sons and
[1:18:50] Daughters of god father has came to us
[1:18:54] and as any father would do he wrapped
[1:18:56] the church he wrapped her in the Robes
[1:18:59] of adoption didn't he put it on you
[1:19:01] didn't he put Authority on you didn't he
[1:19:04] dress
[1:19:05] you I ain't left my subject he washed
[1:19:09] you with the water of his own word and
[1:19:12] he said you never were a servant and you
[1:19:14] never were a slave you always were a son
[1:19:18] that's not a church story that's the
[1:19:20] words of my father hallelujah amen you
[1:19:25] never did it in the first
[1:19:28] place I tell you I'm talking about the
[1:19:30] washing of a church by the word of their
[1:19:33] father the one that birthed you the one
[1:19:36] that knows you the one that was in
[1:19:38] eternity with you met you in the field
[1:19:42] and begin to wrap that robe around you
[1:19:44] and begin to put shoes on your
[1:19:46] feet I don't have time to walk and all
[1:19:49] that but I'll tell you this he took the
[1:19:50] way he walked and changed it
[1:19:54] and when he got ready to come home I
[1:19:57] tell you what he come home in a pair of
[1:19:58] shoes because it wasn't no slave coming
[1:20:00] home it was a son coming home and listen
[1:20:03] you can't never come back to God as a
[1:20:05] slave this bride will never be a servant
[1:20:08] this bride will never go through
[1:20:09] tribulation this bride listen that's why
[1:20:12] we don't spend every Sunday beating the
[1:20:14] people up in this church because you're
[1:20:16] not a servant you're not a slave you're
[1:20:19] a son to begin with you came from God
[1:20:22] you're going back to God Amen we just
[1:20:25] need to know who we are the father's
[1:20:29] words William brandom is not William
[1:20:31] brandom's words it's the father's
[1:20:34] words you always were a son you never
[1:20:38] were a sinner to begin with you were
[1:20:41] always his
[1:20:43] child
[1:20:47] hey I said well I don't know about this
[1:20:49] brother Wayne you know what's powerful
[1:20:51] to
[1:20:52] me he didn't just say it
[1:20:55] but Tommy proved
[1:20:58] it and as the Seed of Abraham we are the
[1:21:01] children of God as Abraham was a son so
[1:21:03] are we is that
[1:21:06] right and when God went to
[1:21:10] Abraham y'all this is very
[1:21:13] powerful Abraham met him at the tent
[1:21:17] door and he fed him
[1:21:20] calf and he washed his feet and he saw
[1:21:24] dirty clothes and he saw a rugged Man
[1:21:29] but when he spoke to him he said
[1:21:32] Lord that Jew who was pulled out there
[1:21:35] to believe in one God had just fed a man
[1:21:38] and called him God hallelujah he saw
[1:21:41] more than a man standing there he saw
[1:21:44] his father had came into a flesh and had
[1:21:47] gave him the promise I tell you what
[1:21:49] brother brandom said about it he said
[1:21:51] matter of fact that man didn't even
[1:21:53] preach the gospel he said he only told
[1:21:55] him the promises hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:58] he only told him the promises and that's
[1:22:01] what this message come to do is to give
[1:22:04] you the promises the promises of God
[1:22:07] it's a Joshua
[1:22:12] commission now let me ask you this you
[1:22:14] say God God well let me tell you this
[1:22:18] Abraham's the one talked to him
[1:22:20] Abraham's the one that fed him and he's
[1:22:22] the one that called him Lord
[1:22:25] you say how could he do that go to
[1:22:27] Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th
[1:22:29] verse he said the word of God is a
[1:22:30] discerner of the thought andt it's the
[1:22:31] heart it's the word and what mecdc was
[1:22:35] is he was the word before he was flesh
[1:22:38] that's why that word was in that body
[1:22:40] and he was
[1:22:42] Discerning that same thing that same
[1:22:45] thing came to this generation when our
[1:22:48] lord Jesus stood there and he went to
[1:22:50] one woman I know you think you're
[1:22:53] unimportant but let me tell you God may
[1:22:55] call a man to preach at the platform for
[1:22:57] one man for one woman amen Jesus the
[1:23:01] king Messiah he said one day walking
[1:23:03] with his disciples he said to them I got
[1:23:06] a need to go down to
[1:23:09] Samaria and he pulled off from the crowd
[1:23:13] and went to one woman and began to speak
[1:23:15] with her and when he began to speak with
[1:23:17] her he began to perform a miracle H her
[1:23:19] brother Mike now people say to us today
[1:23:22] if God before us where are all the
[1:23:23] Miracles what Miracle are you talking
[1:23:26] about because the only miracle in the
[1:23:28] Bible that was the sign of the Messiah
[1:23:30] he said I virgin shall conceive and I
[1:23:32] will give thee a sign and that sign
[1:23:35] According To Jesus was the sign amen one
[1:23:38] given to Jonas that it was three days
[1:23:40] and the belly of the whm is raised again
[1:23:42] that sign is the sign of the Messiah
[1:23:44] which Jesus himself used at that woman
[1:23:48] and spoke to her and said go get your
[1:23:52] husbands she said I don't have one he
[1:23:55] didn't give her a marriage and divorce
[1:23:58] sermon let's get real
[1:24:02] folks he didn't set her down and rebuke
[1:24:04] her over her marriage and divorce
[1:24:06] situation he didn't tell her look I
[1:24:07] don't know if you can even join the
[1:24:09] church cuz you're you're all messed up
[1:24:10] and I don't know how we're going to do
[1:24:11] it listen can I say something to you
[1:24:13] sometimes eggs get scrambled and they're
[1:24:16] scrambled and they can't unscrambled
[1:24:18] scrambled eggs and that woman's eggs
[1:24:21] were scrambled she couldn't do nothing
[1:24:22] about the shape she was in law couldn't
[1:24:25] help her Pharisees couldn't help her but
[1:24:29] father had came to the well
[1:24:33] Hallelujah are you greater than our
[1:24:35] Father Abraham you bet you it was
[1:24:38] Abraham's father that was speaking to
[1:24:41] [Applause]
[1:24:43] her you greater than the one that dug
[1:24:46] this well our Father Abraham
[1:24:50] yeah yeah he was go get your husbands I
[1:24:53] ain't got one that's right cuz You' had
[1:24:55] five and the one you're living with
[1:24:57] ain't
[1:24:59] yours sir the one who the miracle was
[1:25:02] done on said I perceive you're a prophet
[1:25:04] brother BR said you want to know what it
[1:25:06] was ask the woman it was performed
[1:25:09] on she said I perceive thou a prophet
[1:25:12] and we know when the Messiah come he
[1:25:13] will doth these things who are
[1:25:16] you he said I am he that speaketh unto
[1:25:22] you Hallelujah
[1:25:27] what about Nathaniel brother used these
[1:25:29] very words watch that
[1:25:32] sign these very words asked the man it
[1:25:35] was performed
[1:25:37] on Nathaniel stood there and it was
[1:25:39] performed on him and he said I say thou
[1:25:41] the king of
[1:25:43] Israel he knew that sign was not a man
[1:25:47] right listen what about Simon bar Jonah
[1:25:50] when it was performed on him and when
[1:25:53] Jesus said who do you say I am he said I
[1:25:55] say th the Christ the son of the Living
[1:25:58] God he knew who spoke to him he knew it
[1:26:02] was more than a man he knew it was God
[1:26:05] using a man listen in this age I know
[1:26:07] we've seen these things and we've we've
[1:26:09] seen God do great Miracles but the same
[1:26:12] sign that was done in the Bible after
[1:26:14] 2,000 years has been done in this age
[1:26:17] you know why it's to prove to you it's
[1:26:20] the father
[1:26:22] speaking when a prophet looks over at
[1:26:24] the church and he begins to say to you
[1:26:27] that Jesus is the same yesterday today
[1:26:28] and forever see it's the same Jesus that
[1:26:31] passed by zakus standing in a tree and
[1:26:34] told zakus what was in his heart and
[1:26:37] what's what he said to him he said
[1:26:38] salvation's come to your house today
[1:26:42] zakus he has came to seek that which was
[1:26:47] lost father came looking for that which
[1:26:51] was lost it was an attribute
[1:26:54] it was an attribute of God now here's
[1:26:57] the thing in this time we're living it's
[1:27:00] a great Easter
[1:27:01] again and this message coming I'm going
[1:27:04] to be leaving Waters of separation from
[1:27:06] this sermon so I won't be revisiting so
[1:27:08] let me put this point in here do you see
[1:27:11] it's the father and just as our father
[1:27:13] through Moses created the ashes of the
[1:27:16] red hepher so did he bring us the
[1:27:19] opening of this word that this word
[1:27:22] might become the prophet says it like
[1:27:24] this the perfect word of God which is
[1:27:28] the Waters of Separation that washes us
[1:27:31] from our sins that the blood of Christ
[1:27:33] think of it the dripping bloody word the
[1:27:37] blood the word of God bleeding is what's
[1:27:40] we're washing this bride
[1:27:42] in this is the bleach from Heaven itself
[1:27:46] to wash this bride it's something that
[1:27:49] can break up every stain of
[1:27:52] sin now now now and I'm not going to go
[1:27:56] through the whole thought on Clorox
[1:27:57] bleach but let me just let me just say
[1:27:59] this so we can we can we can attribute
[1:28:01] the point of sunship and and it's not
[1:28:04] pre-existence it's
[1:28:06] Eternal if you're a Sunday if you're a
[1:28:08] school student any of you graduated the
[1:28:10] last since the time I was even in high
[1:28:12] school that were teaching I'm sure many
[1:28:14] of you advance beyond that but how many
[1:28:16] knows what the periodic table of
[1:28:17] elements are I think they've added to it
[1:28:20] since since probably we were in school
[1:28:22] but what it is is like if you if you
[1:28:23] look look at water and you see water
[1:28:25] actually that's a that's a that's a
[1:28:27] combustion put two things together you
[1:28:28] call it water but it's in chemical it's
[1:28:30] H2O it's hydrogen oxygen two different
[1:28:33] things so there's a bond that puts it
[1:28:36] together right so if you're looking at
[1:28:37] any substance there are bonds off of
[1:28:40] that periodic table there is one part
[1:28:42] and two parts hydrogen one part oxygen
[1:28:45] they're bonded together now you call
[1:28:46] that water
[1:28:48] right but if you could break that water
[1:28:51] apart then it returns back to hydrogen
[1:28:54] in
[1:28:54] oxygen right so so any substance that is
[1:28:58] broke apart has to return back and
[1:29:00] that's brother brandom's whole point
[1:29:02] about preaching Clorox bleach to you
[1:29:04] because he says whenever you have a
[1:29:05] stain see see there's nothing of
[1:29:08] powerful enough to separate the cloth
[1:29:11] from the grease or the cloth from the
[1:29:13] from the stain he said so the Clorox
[1:29:15] bleach breaks the bond between your
[1:29:18] cloth and between whatever it is holding
[1:29:20] so so when it breaks up where does it go
[1:29:25] now that's that's a real question
[1:29:26] brother said when the when the ink
[1:29:28] leaves the shirt where does it go right
[1:29:31] he said it's got to go somewhere he said
[1:29:34] see it goes back to the gases that
[1:29:36] formed it so that gases broke up and it
[1:29:40] goes back to its periodic table it goes
[1:29:42] back to where it belongs so that ink was
[1:29:45] only a combination of things it wasn't
[1:29:47] the original because the original was on
[1:29:49] that table right so it was this part of
[1:29:51] this and this part of this and this part
[1:29:52] of this now you can see that you didn't
[1:29:55] come from the
[1:29:57] word you were birthed in the earth first
[1:30:00] and that's where sin got mixed into your
[1:30:03] life and that's where as a young man or
[1:30:05] a young woman you grow up and you think
[1:30:07] well this is your identity because you
[1:30:09] think this way and you believe this way
[1:30:10] and you come from this and all of the
[1:30:12] sudden you become in your identity a
[1:30:14] sinner you become oh I'm the son of this
[1:30:17] person and this and I belong to this and
[1:30:18] I'm a part of this and all of that is
[1:30:20] developing who you are and how you think
[1:30:23] and what you believe amen and unless you
[1:30:25] meet something that has power to
[1:30:28] separate that identity from the former
[1:30:31] identity then you'll always remain there
[1:30:35] but God rich in Mercy had decided that
[1:30:38] my sons and my daughters that are in
[1:30:41] this leody Dean age I will not leave the
[1:30:44] filth of leody on them but I'll produce
[1:30:47] a bleach I'll produce a water I'll
[1:30:50] produce a word and that word can
[1:30:53] separate The Sinner from the Sun and he
[1:30:56] could say to you you wasn't always a
[1:30:58] sinner you were a son to begin with and
[1:31:01] when he begins to preach to you it
[1:31:03] begins to
[1:31:04] wash it begins to wash and when it
[1:31:07] begins to wash something what happens to
[1:31:09] the sin brother Brandon said it goes
[1:31:10] back and lays on the head of the
[1:31:13] devil he said the sin goes back to its
[1:31:16] originator it goes back to the head of
[1:31:18] the devil but what about the son what
[1:31:20] happens to him I'm reading the quote he
[1:31:22] says it comes in in perfect fellowship
[1:31:25] with the father
[1:31:28] again see if you can recognize the
[1:31:33] message coming from
[1:31:35] father then you'll see why that you
[1:31:39] heard it so
[1:31:42] gladly for when Jesus was looking at
[1:31:45] Peter and he said who do you say that I
[1:31:47] am and he said I say that thou art
[1:31:51] Christ the son of the Living God he said
[1:31:53] Peter flesh and blood have not revealed
[1:31:54] this unto
[1:31:56] thee but
[1:31:58] what but my
[1:32:02] Father which is in heaven hath revealed
[1:32:04] this unto thee Peter and this is the key
[1:32:07] to my
[1:32:08] kingdom and this is the rock where I'll
[1:32:10] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:32:13] won't be able to Prevail you'll never
[1:32:15] build a wall big enough to keep my
[1:32:17] children away from me there will be not
[1:32:19] enough sin that ever could destroy one
[1:32:21] of them to keep them out of my presence
[1:32:23] I'll go where they are I'll do what is
[1:32:26] needed I will manifest what is possible
[1:32:29] because they are my attributes let me
[1:32:31] tell you this morning you sitting here
[1:32:33] today as the children of God that has
[1:32:35] the Holy Ghost you never began on any
[1:32:37] day and if you didn't begin you're not
[1:32:39] going to end and I don't care what the
[1:32:42] devil does I don't care what comes into
[1:32:44] life I don't care what attacks you or
[1:32:46] what comes at you my father has brought
[1:32:49] a protection in his word to the Church
[1:32:52] of the Living God and he supplies you
[1:32:54] listen he's washing you and giving you
[1:32:57] his Mercy what is it tonight amen that's
[1:33:00] the very thing that a prophet is saying
[1:33:03] amen that she's a part of that word and
[1:33:05] she is a spoken word child do you see
[1:33:09] this morning that you're a part of this
[1:33:12] word to begin
[1:33:15] with hallu you didn't become a part of
[1:33:19] this when you heard it right but when he
[1:33:22] said behold I send unto you Elijah
[1:33:25] you were a
[1:33:27] part of that prophecy
[1:33:31] then even all the way back in the mind
[1:33:33] of God but
[1:33:36] father left his porch kind musicians
[1:33:39] come this morning Father left his
[1:33:44] porch but he could
[1:33:46] only express
[1:33:49] fatherhood as the son of man
[1:33:54] and he
[1:33:56] was the son of
[1:33:59] David and the Son of
[1:34:01] God the son of man brother BR said see
[1:34:04] throughout them ages the Son of God he
[1:34:07] said but he's going to return to Israel
[1:34:09] as the son of David a king he said but
[1:34:12] between those two
[1:34:15] dispensations he's going to reveal
[1:34:17] himself as son of
[1:34:18] man it'll be a short work that's what
[1:34:21] prophesied in Abraham it was just a
[1:34:23] short time
[1:34:25] yeah but he performed a miracle on them
[1:34:29] and they knew who it
[1:34:32] was that same Miracle has been performed
[1:34:34] in this age listen
[1:34:36] folks over 8,000
[1:34:41] times and it never was wrong one
[1:34:46] time how many here in this building sat
[1:34:48] in a meeting and heard that discernment
[1:34:50] I think brother
[1:34:51] Samuel was you in a meeting and heard
[1:34:53] the discernment of the
[1:34:55] Prophet yeah I know that he hosted the
[1:34:58] ones I think in Hot Springs Arkansas I
[1:35:03] believe the same thing the Queen of
[1:35:05] Sheba listened to the same thing that
[1:35:08] Nathaniel heard the same thing look that
[1:35:12] was the
[1:35:14] sign but there's a voice that follows
[1:35:17] that
[1:35:19] sign and here that voice is today
[1:35:24] and whenever this bride becomes the
[1:35:27] voice it's just a man you're
