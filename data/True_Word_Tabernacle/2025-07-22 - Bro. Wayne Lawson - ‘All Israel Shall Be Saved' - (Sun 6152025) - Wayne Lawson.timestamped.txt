[7:40] [Music]
[7:42] Be unto
[7:45] [Music]
[7:50] your name.
[7:53] [Music]
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful name.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tremendous morning. Amen. to be in
[8:02] the house of God and like to say God
[8:04] bless to each of you. Amen. That's able
[8:07] to be here and uh would like to say
[8:10] happy father's day to you all and amen
[8:12] to all the the wonderful fathers that
[8:14] are here this morning. And um you know
[8:17] it's a it's a quite a high calling to be
[8:19] a father
[8:21] &gt;&gt; and uh for one that takes it sincere and
[8:23] serious. He becomes a he comes a
[8:26] provider and a redeemer of his own home
[8:29] and a leader and emotional financial. He
[8:32] becomes the backbone of a home as he
[8:35] leads. And uh we we thank God that in
[8:38] this generation of course the real
[8:41] reality of fatherhood has has been taken
[8:45] and it seems like that there's so many
[8:47] that never stepped up to be what they're
[8:49] supposed to be. So, but as brother
[8:52] Brandham said, if it take a bad woman to
[8:54] show a good one,
[8:56] &gt;&gt; and it'll take a bad man to show a good
[8:58] one. But when you have a when you have
[9:00] good men that are solid Christian men
[9:03] leading their families, bringing them to
[9:05] the house of God, providing them a place
[9:08] to be, what a what a cherished thing
[9:10] that is, amen, to to be able to see it.
[9:13] And we want to take a moment to say
[9:15] thank you. And Amen. I I say God bless
[9:18] you for your dedication. Amen. We uh we
[9:21] certainly appreciate the Lord. It's a
[9:23] it's a direct attribute of God to be a
[9:26] father. I love how the Lord's prayer
[9:29] always began. Our father which is in
[9:32] heaven. Amen. What a what a blessing.
[9:35] Amen. Of a fatherhood. Amen. I uh just
[9:39] have a few things on our heart today.
[9:41] And we would like to just before we go
[9:43] to the scripture, maybe we would just go
[9:45] to the Lord in a word of prayer. Amen.
[9:47] And we want to take just a moment and
[9:50] thank the Lord for his fatherhood over
[9:52] our lives. And amen for uh for the grace
[9:55] that he has given us.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we bow our hearts this
[9:59] morning. We thank you for your word
[10:01] Lord. We want to thank you for the word
[10:05] Lord that has birthed children in this
[10:07] age. For the mercy that you have shown
[10:09] us, for the provision that you have
[10:12] given us. Lord we thank you for the care
[10:15] for the for the strength Lord which you
[10:18] have given to this age through your
[10:20] word. Lord we thank you for these
[10:22] heavenly father we thank you for but we
[10:24] thank you for this earthly fatherhood
[10:27] Lord that you have put among us Lord the
[10:29] grace that you have shown these men Lord
[10:32] and their families. We thank you for the
[10:34] many strong and wonderful leaders that
[10:37] you have put here among us Father. We
[10:39] pray that you would strengthen them,
[10:41] Lord. And Father, as we would take your
[10:44] word this morning, we ask that you would
[10:46] come here today, that you would use this
[10:48] service for your glory and your honor.
[10:51] And Lord, we dedicate this moment, Lord,
[10:53] to your word. That you would take it and
[10:55] you would speak to the heart and to the
[10:57] need of your children. For we ask it in
[10:59] the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we
[11:01] pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless you.
[11:06] Amen. If you have your Bibles today,
[11:08] Amen. I'm I'm not going to be so much
[11:12] speaking a Father's Day message today. I
[11:14] I want to I want to take from the book
[11:16] of Romans, the 11th chapter, and I want
[11:18] to read uh Romans 11:25
[11:21] down to verse 28. Um this will be uh
[11:25] back a little bit in this series of
[11:28] thoughts that we have been under under
[11:30] the revelations contained under the
[11:32] seals. Of course, I was speaking on the
[11:34] opening of the word and and then as the
[11:36] word opened, I just wanted to take some
[11:38] of the revelations that were laying
[11:40] under the seal and speak about those
[11:42] revelations, not so much maybe even in
[11:45] order, but just as they was inspired to
[11:47] me personally. Um in Romans 11 and 25,
[11:51] the Apostle Paul of course writing
[11:53] concerning Israel, he said, "For I would
[11:55] not, brethren, that you should be
[11:58] ignorant of this mystery, lest that you
[12:01] would be wise in your own conceits, that
[12:04] the blindness in part is happen to
[12:07] Israel until the fullness of the
[12:10] Gentiles be come in."
[12:14] And so Israel So all Israel shall be
[12:18] saved. That's that's a pretty powerful
[12:20] statement. So all Israel shall be saved.
[12:25] As it is written, there shall come out
[12:26] of Zion the deliverer and shall turn
[12:29] away the ungodliness from Jacob. And for
[12:32] this is my covenant unto them which I
[12:34] shall take away their sins. And as
[12:37] concerning the gospel, they are enemies
[12:40] for your sakes.
[12:42] but as touching the election,
[12:45] they are beloved for the father's sake.
[12:48] Amen. We just ask the Lord to bless his
[12:50] word. As you could be seated this
[12:52] morning, if uh I would take a subtitle
[12:55] on this, I want to speak to you today on
[12:58] all Israel shall be saved. All Israel
[13:03] shall be saved. Amen. I I I think it's a
[13:07] powerful reality when you start
[13:10] realizing the sovereignty of God.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's beyond uh what we could hope
[13:16] or think or as Paul would say it, it's
[13:19] not he that welleleth nor he that runth,
[13:22] but it's God that shows mercy.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we look here this morning
[13:26] at the ideal that all of Israel shall be
[13:30] saved, I say we have to first understand
[13:33] that not all Israel is Israel.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so you recognize that the
[13:39] part of Israel that will be saved is the
[13:42] part that God elected. Just as he
[13:44] elected this bride, he also numbered a a
[13:48] a remnant of the Jews of Israel that
[13:51] would be saved and have their names on
[13:54] the book the same as you do. Amen. And
[13:56] we so we recognize uh that this is uh
[13:59] this statement of Paul that all of
[14:02] Israel should be saved really gains its
[14:04] traction or it becomes enlightened
[14:08] in the end time message. And it's not
[14:10] until the fifth seal that you really see
[14:13] the potency and the power of what Paul
[14:15] is saying. But if you're under the seals
[14:18] here in the end time, you find brother
[14:20] Brandon will speak this in the fifth
[14:21] seal in Revelations chapter 6. I'll read
[14:24] the 9th through the 11th verse
[14:26] concerning this seal. And when he had
[14:28] opened the fifth seal, I was I saw under
[14:30] the altar the souls of them that were
[14:34] slain for the word of God. Now, brother
[14:36] Ram takes a a moment to tell us that
[14:38] they were slain for the word of God. It
[14:41] doesn't say they were slain for the
[14:42] testimony of Jesus Christ as the martyrs
[14:45] of the church was, but these were slain
[14:48] for the word of God and for the
[14:50] testimony which they held. And brother
[14:52] said they were Jews. They were they were
[14:54] they were practicing Jews and they never
[14:57] became Christians. and those souls that
[14:59] were under there. He said, "I want you
[15:00] to know that they were not the early
[15:03] church that had been slain as martyrs uh
[15:05] for the gospel because it depicts it was
[15:08] not them." He says, "And for the
[15:10] testimony, and they cried with a loud
[15:12] voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, do
[15:15] thou not judge and avenge our blood upon
[15:18] them upon the earth?" And brother Ram
[15:19] said, "Now, here's another key point.
[15:21] This is not bride material." He said
[15:24] because the bride here would not be
[15:26] crying for vengeance but rather her
[15:29] voice would be the voice of mercy. Amen.
[15:31] How many recognize brother said that the
[15:33] bride would not persecute bride or and
[15:36] then he says or anyone else. I I like
[15:39] that. Or anyone else. And when you see
[15:42] an old persecuting spirit or revengeful
[15:44] spirit that's not the spirit of Christ.
[15:47] And and this bride is the lamb's wife.
[15:50] She cries for mercy. Matter of fact,
[15:52] amen. She is the voice of mercy in the
[15:55] end time. Mercy, amen, is in the bride
[15:58] of Jesus Christ as the voice of God. And
[16:00] I could get a little deeper. Y'all know,
[16:03] amen, that you have become the blood of
[16:05] Christ by the spirit. Amen. So, not only
[16:07] are you just a voice, but your very
[16:09] spirit that is in you is the blood of
[16:12] Christ to this earth and to this. And if
[16:14] you don't think that it's powerful that
[16:16] way, I'll say it again this way. Brother
[16:18] Bram said, "When this bride goes off of
[16:20] the earth, Satan will come down." So
[16:21] what what what what's holding Satan off
[16:24] this morning is the bride of Jesus
[16:26] Christ. Amen. And she's a voice of
[16:28] mercy. I and and people don't agree with
[16:30] her and she prays for mercy and and and
[16:33] people persecute her and she prays for
[16:35] mercy because she is the voice of mercy.
[16:38] So these people under this altar most
[16:40] certainly were not amen the early church
[16:42] nor are they the bride of Christ. He
[16:44] says and they cried for vengeance and
[16:46] then white robes were given every one of
[16:49] them. And it was said unto them that
[16:51] they should rest yet for a little season
[16:53] till the fellow servants and their
[16:55] brethren should be killed and they were
[16:57] and they were should be fulfilled.
[17:02] Now this is certainly dealing uh uh
[17:06] brother Brandon will say it. He says if
[17:08] this is not the early church then this
[17:11] is Israel that's got to be saved as a
[17:13] nation. He said all them that are
[17:16] predestinated that's Israel. See that's
[17:19] Israel itself. If this is not the early
[17:22] church, who is it? Brother Bam says it
[17:24] is Israel. Now Israel, all of Israel, he
[17:27] said, will be saved. And now this is
[17:29] according to lection. That God the
[17:32] father has loved them and blinded them
[17:35] that we Gentiles might have a place of
[17:37] repentance.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; That through Abraham and his seeds, he
[17:41] said, all the world according to his
[17:42] word. See how the sovereignty of God is.
[17:45] His words got to be just can't be
[17:48] nothing else. See, God elected us and he
[17:52] also elected the Jews.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Now, all of Israel shall be saved. And
[17:57] now, the powerful point behind this
[17:59] today is you'll see what God to save his
[18:03] elect. And if he would go through that
[18:05] to save the elect Jew, look also what he
[18:08] does to save that elect bride. He was so
[18:11] intent on saving the elect bride that he
[18:14] purposely and brother Benam say this in
[18:16] six-fold purpose of Daniel's uh
[18:18] Gabriel's visit to Daniel. God blinded
[18:21] them purposely for you and I. They
[18:24] cannot see because God blinded them.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. God blinded them. Now friends, you
[18:31] you think of this. They were blinded.
[18:34] Brother Bam says that the of course the
[18:36] Israel was blinded. He says, "Until the
[18:39] fullness of the Gentiles come in." So
[18:41] someone says, "Israel is blinded." Those
[18:43] Jews that rejected Christ while he was
[18:46] on the earth doing the signs of the
[18:48] Messiah, fulfilling all prophecies that
[18:51] were spoke of him and fulfilling them to
[18:54] the very letter. And brother Bram said,
[18:55] "And there his own children crucified
[18:58] him." He said, "Because they were blind
[19:01] to it." That's they would have knew him.
[19:03] They would have saw him, but they were
[19:05] blind to it. it. And brother B said,
[19:06] "And that blindness, of course, Paul
[19:08] says it as well. It was happening for
[19:10] you and I." God blinded his own children
[19:14] that you and I might be saved. I'll tell
[19:17] you, brother, I'm going say it like
[19:18] this. Until the fullness of the
[19:19] Gentiles. Paul says, "Until the how long
[19:22] will they remain blind? Until the
[19:24] fullness of the Gentiles come." Now, we
[19:26] know the fullness of the Gentiles is the
[19:29] book of Revelations, the second and
[19:30] third chapter, which is the church ages.
[19:33] so that the blindness of Israel will
[19:35] remain upon them until the bride be
[19:38] taken off of the earth. Now, that's a
[19:40] very powerful thing. That's why that you
[19:43] cannot go over there and convert the
[19:44] Jews. And I know a lot of people's tried
[19:46] it. Amen. But those Jews will not be
[19:49] converted. How many knows Israel will be
[19:50] born in a day? Amen. They they we're not
[19:53] going to go over as a bunch of Gentiles
[19:55] and convert them. Brother Bam said it'll
[19:56] take a prophet. Amen. They're expecting
[19:59] Elijah. It'll take Elijah the prophet.
[20:01] And brother Bham said, "And I started to
[20:03] go over there." Amen. But the angel of
[20:05] the Lord stopped me and said, "It's not
[20:07] time yet." Now, why wasn't it time?
[20:10] Because you and I were yet to come to
[20:12] Christ that God would allow all he's
[20:15] allowed, Amen, to give you a space of
[20:17] repentance. Let me let me just say to
[20:19] you this morning, if you belong to the
[20:21] Lord and your name is on that lamb's
[20:23] book of life, God will hold back
[20:26] judgments. He'll hold back the devil.
[20:28] He'll hold back everything until that
[20:31] bride gets a repentance that he has
[20:33] called for her to have. Look, he said,
[20:35] "I I will not lose one of them." Amen.
[20:38] Do you know that God is so numbered?
[20:40] This bride. Somebody said, "Well, Amen.
[20:42] You might miss the rapture." That that
[20:44] is completely a bad thought concerning
[20:47] the sovereignty of God. He will not lose
[20:50] one. Come on, church. If your name is in
[20:53] that lamb's book of life, he will turn
[20:56] over this earth to get that bride to
[20:59] repent in this last day. Now, I'm not
[21:01] saying he won't allow some things to
[21:03] happen in your life to make you want to
[21:05] repent.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. They used to preach that old
[21:08] sermon, he'll burn your barley fields.
[21:10] You know, if God's called you, Amen,
[21:13] you're coming.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; They used to say the devil's going to
[21:17] get you. I'll say you this. Jesus is
[21:19] going to get you. If you belong to him,
[21:22] Jesus is going to get you. He'll haunt
[21:24] your dreams. He'll wake you up in the
[21:26] middle of the night. Amen. You can be
[21:28] sitting on a bar stool somewhere and
[21:31] some drunk will ask you about the Lord.
[21:33] Amen. I I probably shouldn't tell it,
[21:35] but some of my first sermons I I
[21:37] preached to a Pentecostal boy over a
[21:39] fifth of whiskey. Amen. Because even
[21:42] when I was in a drunkard stoop, God was
[21:44] still dealing with me. When I was living
[21:47] in sin, God was dealing with me. And
[21:49] listen, I see young people, they act
[21:51] like they don't care nothing about it. I
[21:53] you you can't fool me. I know what's
[21:56] happening on the inside. If there's a
[21:58] seed in there, Amen. There's a reason
[22:00] they act cuz they're trying to cover up
[22:03] what God is really dealing in their
[22:05] life. But God will get you. Amen. This
[22:07] message will get you. This message come
[22:10] to claim a bride and it'll get every
[22:13] last one that belongs to God. This third
[22:15] pull will it will catch every trout that
[22:19] belongs to God.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; I have no doubt that he will get every
[22:23] one of them. And the brother Bam said
[22:25] it's actually numbered.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; And Israel is blinded. See, he blinded
[22:30] his own children. And brother Bam said,
[22:33] see they're standing at the cross and
[22:35] them Jews howling for his blood. That
[22:37] was his own kids.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[22:41] &gt;&gt; that was his own kids. And there was the
[22:43] scripture. He was the word and knowing
[22:46] these people have would they would have
[22:48] glad now he's talking about the cross he
[22:50] said they would have gladly received him
[22:53] &gt;&gt; but the reason he blinded them and they
[22:56] wouldn't recognize him is he come in
[22:58] such a humble way blinded them that they
[23:02] wouldn't receive it
[23:06] &gt;&gt; but that scripture said they wouldn't he
[23:08] said he blinded them and Jesus pied them
[23:12] even so much She said, "Father, forgive
[23:15] them. They don't know what they're
[23:19] doing."
[23:21] &gt;&gt; He blinded them. Brother Bam said, "Now,
[23:23] watch that real close." He said, "They
[23:25] were given white robes." Now, you you
[23:28] see why the scripture says that those
[23:30] under the altar were martyrs. Now, these
[23:33] were not, as we preached the other day,
[23:35] heaven's real. If you were here, I
[23:37] talked a lot about the white robed ones
[23:38] in the 60 mansion. But in the fifth
[23:41] seal, Brother Bam will deterior uh
[23:43] deliberate or he will divide the altars
[23:47] in heaven and he'll tell you about two
[23:49] different altars. He'll tell you about
[23:51] an altars of the martyrs and then an
[23:54] altar of sacrifice. Now the gentile
[23:56] bride received the blood of Jesus
[23:58] Christ. So in that sixth dimension
[24:00] they're laying under the altar of
[24:02] sacrifice already in white robes. Amen.
[24:06] But these had to be given white robes.
[24:09] So, they're under the altar of a martyr
[24:12] rather than the altar of sacrifice,
[24:14] having accepted Jesus. But watch, but
[24:16] they are not lost even though they
[24:19] didn't receive the blood of Christ. He
[24:21] had an altar to put them under because
[24:24] they were blinded for you and I's sake.
[24:27] So, when this is all done, he said, "I
[24:29] give them white robes." He would give
[24:32] them grace. Now, you say, "Preacher,
[24:34] that's awful. That's awful. Uh, that's
[24:36] awful. Reaching out there that they
[24:37] didn't even have a new birth, but
[24:39] they're going to receive an inheritance
[24:40] of a white robe. Oh, yes. Yes. We're
[24:44] talking about the grace of God. I don't
[24:46] know if we yet have been able to fathom
[24:49] the grace of God. But this scripture
[24:52] ought to really show us the grace of the
[24:55] God that you're serving. These people
[24:57] rejected Christ. They killed him. They
[25:00] they rejected the gospel. They burned
[25:02] the Bibles. They want nothing to do with
[25:04] what we call Christianity. But they gave
[25:07] their lives because they were blinded to
[25:09] what you believe. But when it's all
[25:11] done, God said, "Here you is a white
[25:14] robe that you would be able to enter in
[25:16] just like you received it because we're
[25:19] talking about the grace of God."
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, we want Bible for
[25:22] it." I'm glad you asked. There's a story
[25:25] in the Bible of a man named Joseph. Do
[25:27] you know which is almost a quarter of
[25:29] the Old Testament? Amen. Well, it's
[25:31] almost a quarter of the Old Testament is
[25:33] the book of Joseph. I think it states
[25:35] starts around Genesis 37 and goes to the
[25:37] end of the book of Genesis. And right in
[25:39] the middle of it, it's amazing because
[25:41] it starts and then in Genesis 38, you
[25:43] find here comes Tamar and Judah. Amen.
[25:46] Now, why would God inject these little
[25:48] stories in the middle of Joseph? Because
[25:50] he's talking about the preservation of
[25:52] the seed of Judah.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Tamar presume pres actually actually
[25:57] preserves the seed of Judah. And and
[25:59] look at what God does to get the seed
[26:02] preserved. Amen. Look at the desperation
[26:04] of Tamar showing you that God is going
[26:07] to have a seed even if he had to cause
[26:10] Tamar to do things which is not
[26:12] understandable to us. Amen. But when
[26:14] Judah saw what she did, Amen. Just in
[26:17] case somebody's here don't know the
[26:18] story of Tamar, let me tell it real
[26:19] quick. I'll tell the quick version of
[26:21] it. Amen. Y'all remember that Judah,
[26:24] Amen, he had to have sons cuz the Bible
[26:26] said that the lawgiver would come out of
[26:28] Judah.
[26:29] the Messiah would come out of Judah.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; It was a it was a king lying Judah. And
[26:34] we find that that he wasn't able to have
[26:36] any. Remember his sons kept dying and
[26:39] his daughter-in-laws went without seed
[26:42] &gt;&gt; and and there was one who had been put
[26:44] in widowhood named Tamar. And they put
[26:46] her away and said, "No, I don't have any
[26:47] more sons for you." And they put her
[26:49] away. But when she got to thinking about
[26:51] this, she put on a dress of harlotry and
[26:55] sat by the whale and sold herself to
[26:57] Judah, which was her father-in-law.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Which seems crazy, but it was
[27:02] desperation working in her to preserve
[27:05] that seed.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; And when he went into her, remember,
[27:08] Amen. He says, "I don't have any money."
[27:10] She said, "Well, I'll take your token of
[27:12] your ring and your staff." Remember
[27:14] that? And then when he sent a kid by
[27:17] somebody else to go pay, the woman had
[27:19] disappeared with his staff and with his
[27:22] ring.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there she was and somebody
[27:24] comes and says, "Judah, your
[27:26] daughter-in-law Tamar has played the
[27:28] part of a harlot and she's with child.
[27:30] We're going to have to burn her as a as
[27:32] a harlot. Remember?" And he went to pass
[27:34] judgment on her. And when judgment
[27:36] started to come to her, she pulled out a
[27:38] token
[27:40] &gt;&gt; and said, "The thing that is in me
[27:41] belongs to you." And he said, "You're
[27:44] more righteous than I am righteous
[27:47] because she proved the seed that was in
[27:50] her was the seed of the line of Judah."
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, church of the living God. That's
[27:56] exactly when you see what seed is in
[27:58] you, there's a token that no matter how
[28:01] you come to him, Amen. There's a token
[28:04] laying there. This is my seat. All
[28:06] Israel shall
[28:09] &gt;&gt; be saved. That's right. and she saved
[28:12] that whole line.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; And look at how Judah brings it. And
[28:15] then we see Joseph come into the
[28:17] scriptures and and God sovereignly knew
[28:20] there was a famine coming to the land.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; And Joseph comes up, which is only a
[28:25] prophecy. You know, some prophecies are
[28:26] not written, they're lived, right?
[28:28] &gt;&gt; And Joseph lived the prophecy. Matter of
[28:31] fact, if you interpret the life of
[28:33] Joseph, you don't you you can't
[28:35] interpret Joseph's life until Jesus
[28:37] Christ. Right.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; There there is nothing. Amen. You make
[28:42] sense of all of it without Jesus.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Because there's certain things
[28:47] that happen in your life. It takes it
[28:50] takes Christ to interpret.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I I'll just take this on a on a on
[28:54] a level of this basis for us as as
[28:57] believers. There's nothing that happens
[28:59] in your life that it will take God to
[29:03] interpret to come out right.
[29:06] I tell you what, let a tragedy happen in
[29:08] one of your homes and let the devil
[29:09] interpret it and see how you come out.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; God don't love you. God don't answer
[29:13] prayer. God don't keep us covenants.
[29:15] These prayers don't work. Amen.
[29:18] Healing's not for real. Why did this
[29:20] happen to me? All of that comes from the
[29:22] voice of the devil. Listen, your God is
[29:24] right.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; In every decision, he's right and he is
[29:28] faithful and he is true and he has never
[29:31] forsaken you.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Nay, in all things we
[29:36] are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus
[29:38] who loved us. If God be for us,
[29:41] &gt;&gt; who can be against us? And the Bible
[29:43] said this very clearly that all things
[29:46] work together for the good of them that
[29:48] love God and are called according to his
[29:50] purpose. But you know what you're going
[29:51] to have to have? You're going to have to
[29:52] have an interpreter.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Because if the devil interprets, look
[29:56] what he done for Eve.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; The word means this, then look what it
[30:00] happened. She got pulled out of Eden.
[30:02] And the moment you let the devil start
[30:04] messing with your mind, you're coming
[30:06] out of Eden.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; You're coming out of peace into into
[30:09] anxiety. You're coming out of joy and
[30:11] you're dropping down into depressions
[30:13] and mlly grubs and Amen. But you one
[30:16] time let the scripture interpret your
[30:18] situation and you'll see that you're
[30:20] going through something for your
[30:22] character.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. Look at it from God's point of
[30:26] view just for a moment.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Look at it from God's point of view for
[30:30] a moment.
[30:32] Character is what is required to rule.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; And brother man makes it very clear
[30:38] power without character is satanic.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; So look at the power God is giving you
[30:45] as a church. If there was no character
[30:49] molding trials to come with the power
[30:51] that was given then the church would
[30:53] rather than be holy.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Power without character is satanic.
[31:01] Yeah.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Right. But power with character fit the
[31:04] rule. Problem is character is not a
[31:07] gift. It's a victory.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; It's a victory over every trial. So when
[31:11] character comes, you say, "Preacher, why
[31:14] does the church suffer? Why does family
[31:16] suffer? Why does things suffer?" I'll
[31:18] tell you why they suffer. Because
[31:19] Revelations the 20th chapter says that
[31:21] you have a throne setting in the
[31:23] millennium and you are the kings of the
[31:26] earth that is coming into pass. This is
[31:28] kings. He is the king of
[31:32] &gt;&gt; kings
[31:33] &gt;&gt; rulers sitting here. So there must be a
[31:36] vision. Now you're you're learning from
[31:38] Joseph's life. There must be a vision of
[31:41] leadership to suffer the trial with
[31:44] integrity.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; There must be an understanding with
[31:48] purpose. We come to it with purpose.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; See? See it happens with purpose. All
[31:53] things work together for the good of
[31:54] them. So whatever comes your way, watch
[31:56] this. If you let God, if you let God
[31:59] interpret it, but put it that way. So,
[32:01] watch what Joseph does. Interpret his
[32:03] life by Christ and see uh you know, he
[32:06] he's born of his father. He's loved of
[32:08] his father. He's given a robe. Now, if
[32:10] you take that to Jesus, he was born of
[32:13] the father. He was given the favor of
[32:15] the father. He was loved of the father.
[32:18] He's given the covenant of the father.
[32:20] Do you see? And because that it said he
[32:23] would be the Messiah, he's rejected of
[32:25] his brethren.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Right. That's true.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Because he was shown a vision of
[32:29] leadership
[32:30] &gt;&gt; and Joseph told it.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So his brothers started hating him
[32:35] and then he went to his mom and dad and
[32:36] told them the story and they started
[32:38] hating him.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; And then they sold him
[32:41] &gt;&gt; for silver the same as Jesus was sold
[32:44] for silver.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; And he was thrown in a pit just like
[32:47] Jesus was thrown in a pit.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; And look and they took the blood of an
[32:52] animal and put it on his garment and
[32:53] said that he was dead. Yeah.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; And they took Jesus, the blood of Jesus
[32:59] from Calvary was put on the covenant of
[33:01] the rainbow.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; And everyone said he was dead.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't dead.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; He had resurrected
[33:09] &gt;&gt; and he was come to be the Lord of the
[33:12] Gentiles.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Do you see the life of Jesus Christ
[33:17] specifically interprets Joseph's life
[33:21] and his coming to a throne? Now, when he
[33:22] got to the throne, he wasn't bitter.
[33:26] But when his brethren came to him and
[33:29] realized, "We did this to you." What did
[33:31] he say?
[33:32] &gt;&gt; No, you meant it for evil, but God meant
[33:34] it for good.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Look what he done. He flipped the script
[33:38] on them.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; We are not going to have a fight here.
[33:42] Look, you did it for evil, but God did
[33:44] it for good.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; It don't matter what you do to a
[33:47] believer. You throw anything you got at
[33:49] a believer, and God will make it turn
[33:51] out good.
[33:53] Everything that comes in a believer, God
[33:55] will make it turn to the good.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; It'll come out to the good every time.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; And and look and look what he done. He
[34:02] he he turned it right there and said,
[34:04] "God did this to preserve life."
[34:07] &gt;&gt; And brother said, "There it is." See, he
[34:10] gave them grace at the end. He said,
[34:13] "And there it is. Jesus giving grace to
[34:15] Israel at the end." You see, it's a
[34:18] beautiful type in Joseph. What is it?
[34:20] Even Joseph, Amen. And you say, "Well,
[34:22] what was he what was he rejected for?
[34:25] Why did he go there?" Brother B brings
[34:27] it out of the scripture and he said he
[34:28] did it so he could take a gentile wife.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; According to the book of Acts, remember
[34:34] the disciples are arguing over whether
[34:37] the gospel are to go to the Gentiles.
[34:40] And they then began to bring up the
[34:41] prophecies in Amos and said that he
[34:43] would take a people for his name's sake
[34:45] and rebuild again the tabernacle of
[34:47] David. and and and it was then that they
[34:50] knew that it would be a people for the
[34:52] name's sake. Now watch the difference
[34:53] between the gentile and the Jew is a
[34:55] gentile is saved as an individual. The
[34:57] Jew is saved as a nation.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; So when he says a people for his name,
[35:02] he's speaking of individual people who
[35:04] become carrying the name of the Lord
[35:07] Jesus Christ. Now we don't have a name
[35:09] written on us of man which is 666 or
[35:11] denominational word. But you've had
[35:14] another name written on you, which is
[35:16] the word of God of the age, and you take
[35:18] the name, the manifested word of your
[35:21] age. You take the name. I don't have
[35:22] time to preach on that, but but I'll
[35:24] just say it. It's the gentile. While
[35:27] he's rejected, he takes a gentile wife.
[35:30] And you see perfectly that that was the
[35:32] rejection of Christ and he took a
[35:35] gentile wife. So this was a blindness
[35:38] that come upon Israel just as a
[35:41] blindness had come upon the brethren of
[35:43] Joseph but it was only for a season.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Now that's important uh that we that we
[35:49] realize it's only for a season.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Now watch how he says brother Bman
[35:55] questions and answers. He says now watch
[35:57] he said he said now somewhere back there
[35:59] he said when they shall be cast out
[36:01] doesn't that mean that they'll be cast
[36:03] out of God's mind? He said they are
[36:06] brother Bram said but see they are cast
[36:08] out of spiritual benefits for a season
[36:12] &gt;&gt; just a little season
[36:14] &gt;&gt; because what the prophet saw he said
[36:16] Israel he says it will be Israel see
[36:20] when God blinded them and God allowed
[36:24] the rejection of Christ it's just for a
[36:26] season. So, so there's many ask the
[36:29] question,
[36:31] will Israel be forgotten?
[36:34] See, he's taken out of the out of out of
[36:36] out of out of the blessings,
[36:39] &gt;&gt; but not out of the mind of God.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; See, not cast out of the mind. So then
[36:44] you say, "Is Israel forgotten?" No,
[36:46] Israel is not forgotten. I I I think of
[36:49] the beauty of the scripture. If you pull
[36:50] me up Isaiah 49, let's go 13 to verse
[36:54] 16. Amen. Amen. I I thank you all for
[36:57] being uh wise virgins this morning.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing, O heavens.
[37:05] You'll get it tomorrow. Yeah. Sing, O
[37:07] heavens, and be joyful, O earth,
[37:09] &gt;&gt; and break forth into singing, O
[37:11] mountains, for the Lord hath comforted
[37:14] his people, and will have mercy upon his
[37:18] afflicted. Yeah,
[37:20] &gt;&gt; but Zion hath said, "The Lord hath
[37:23] forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten
[37:26] me." And here's Isaiah's answer. Can a
[37:29] woman forget her suckling child?
[37:32] &gt;&gt; That she should not have compassion on
[37:34] her son of her womb? Yay, they may
[37:37] forget, but I will not forget thee.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; I will not forget thee. I think that's
[37:44] one of the greatest words ever spoken. I
[37:47] will not forget thee. Here is God
[37:50] telling Israel, I cannot forget you.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Look, God cannot forget this church. He
[37:56] and brother Ram said he even had it
[37:58] graven on the palms of his hand. Do you
[38:00] know that Jesus even died for those that
[38:03] were rejecting him? Those white robes
[38:06] that he gives out comes from the grace
[38:09] that come from the blood of Jesus Christ
[38:11] at the cross.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see? Somebody said, "Well,
[38:15] has God forgotten his people?" But I
[38:16] want you to know something. God never
[38:18] forgets Israel. God has never forgotten
[38:20] Israel. Somebody said, "Well, why did
[38:22] they go through this and why did they go
[38:23] through that?" It would only be for a
[38:25] season. It would only be a season that
[38:28] God would take them out of their
[38:29] benefits. But even in that season, there
[38:31] was a purpose. And that purpose was
[38:33] there would be a gentile bride. I love
[38:35] how Paul says it in Romans 11 and verse
[38:37] one. I say then, hath God cast away his
[38:40] people? God forbid. For I am an
[38:43] Israelite, even the seed of Abraham and
[38:45] the tribe of Judah. God hath not cast
[38:48] away his people, which he forneew. What
[38:51] not? The scripture saith, Elias, how he
[38:53] maketh intercession to God against
[38:56] Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed
[38:58] the prophets. They have dig down thine
[38:59] altars, and I am a left. Look at a
[39:01] prophet speaking about the trouble in
[39:04] Israel. And even Paul says it like this.
[39:07] But God had to answer him and said,
[39:09] "I've reserved myself 7,000 men who have
[39:12] not bowed an E to to Baal." And even
[39:15] though at this present time, there is a
[39:17] remnant according to the election of
[39:19] grace.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Amen. There's Elijah
[39:22] telling God, "They're all doing it.
[39:24] They're all doing. Look at all the
[39:26] thing. There ain't nobody left." And God
[39:28] then, Brother Bam said, he broke open
[39:30] the book and let and let Elijah see it
[39:32] that there was a remnant that he
[39:34] reserved that should be saved. And there
[39:37] is, I don't care what you see, Israel,
[39:39] it doesn't matter what it looks like,
[39:41] Christ rejecting, you think there's no
[39:43] hope for them. But I'll say this, in
[39:45] this last day, we have received an eagle
[39:47] from God. And that eagle has rose up
[39:50] into the mind of God and said, "Yeah,
[39:52] it's still there. Israel is still in the
[39:54] mind of God. I don't know what it looks
[39:56] like to you, but Israel is still in the
[39:58] mind of God." Oh, that ought to set this
[40:00] bride on fire to know that if God can
[40:03] let a bride Amen. let Israel do all of
[40:06] that, go through all that, act all that
[40:08] way and then still put a prophet on the
[40:12] scene to say to this gentile bride.
[40:14] Somebody said, "Well, then why did
[40:15] Luther say such bad things?" I'll tell
[40:17] you why. Because he was a reformer. He
[40:20] wasn't a prophet.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was a reformer, not a prophet.
[40:25] But a prophet could never
[40:28] &gt;&gt; say that God had forgotten Israel
[40:30] because God would show him immediately
[40:32] that there is Israel. They're cast out.
[40:35] I love how Brother Bam says cast out but
[40:38] not out of his mind.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; You said, "Preacher, why are you
[40:42] excited?" But I'll tell you this as a
[40:44] gentile people cuz there's been times in
[40:46] your life you was out.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; You was out of benefits because of your
[40:50] sin and your trouble. Amen. And but
[40:52] listen, you might have been out of
[40:54] blessings. You might have been out of
[40:56] benefits as a as somebody out here in
[40:58] the world, but you never been out of the
[41:00] mind of God.
[41:02] You was on his mind. Amen. When his own
[41:05] children were rejecting him of the
[41:07] cross.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; There was something on his mind then.
[41:10] And he still has that in his mind now. I
[41:12] thank God. Amen. That God is not like a
[41:15] man that he is absent minded. Listen, he
[41:18] has never forgot you. He has never
[41:20] forgot this bride. Amen. You cannot be
[41:24] out of his mind. Yeah, that's right.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Israel didn't close their eyes.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; They were blinded.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Blinded because of us.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; The charge
[41:40] was before Calvary.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; The charge was before Calvary.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Now, seasons. Let's just talk about
[41:49] seasons.
[41:51] Sister Satie, it's it's been a season.
[41:54] We have been so blessed to have you with
[41:56] us.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; It's been it's been a real blessing.
[41:58] Brother Tim introduced to us to her a
[42:01] few weeks ago and the Smalls have been
[42:03] bringing her over and I think brother
[42:05] John's got him a new granddaughter. He
[42:07] has took her responsibility for her and
[42:10] but she's going to have to be moving on
[42:11] to Missouri. It's a season,
[42:14] &gt;&gt; move on with her family. Now, if that
[42:15] season gets over you, come on back,
[42:17] okay? We'll we'll get you a seat.
[42:21] But there but there's seasons
[42:23] &gt;&gt; and there's purpose in those seasons.
[42:25] Now now I I I'll just say you remember
[42:28] as as we look back in history, Abraham
[42:32] before they ever went into the promised
[42:34] land was told that his children would be
[42:37] there only for a time and then they were
[42:38] going to be carried into Egypt for 400
[42:40] years.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[42:43] &gt;&gt; but at that they would come an end to
[42:45] that 400 years and God would send a
[42:47] deliverer. Yeah,
[42:49] &gt;&gt; those same ones that God sent a
[42:51] deliverer and brought out began to sin
[42:54] again.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; And God then raised up a man named uh uh
[42:58] Nebuchadnezzar
[43:00] and sent Jeremiah among them
[43:03] &gt;&gt; and said that Nebuchadnezzar is going to
[43:05] tear down the temple and he's going to
[43:08] carry off a bunch of you into Babylon.
[43:11] And Jeremiah prophesied and said it'll
[43:13] be 70 years before you return.
[43:16] Now there was a lot of other people said
[43:18] a lot of things but Jeremiah was a
[43:20] vindicated prophet.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that he says 70 years. Now if
[43:24] you're looking uh of course that's
[43:25] Jeremiah chapter 25 and we find that
[43:28] this is the prophecies
[43:31] that Daniel is reading when he is coming
[43:34] to the end of the captivity. So 70 years
[43:37] they've been down in captivity and
[43:38] Daniel's been among them and he's been
[43:40] lifted up among the among them and he's
[43:43] he's been there in Babylon. And when
[43:45] it's about 68 years, there's about two
[43:47] years left of desperation starts really
[43:51] striking the heart of Daniel that it's
[43:55] the time, the season is changing.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bam preaches a message. You
[44:02] remember he preaches token and then
[44:04] preaches desperations.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam talks about desperation
[44:08] coming a couple different ways. And he
[44:10] said one thing that causes desperation
[44:13] is tragedy. He said, "But another thing
[44:15] that causes desperation is revelation."
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And the desperation that had fell upon
[44:21] Daniel was that he had read the
[44:23] scriptures and knew that the time and
[44:26] season was changing.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; He knew that the prophesied years of
[44:31] Jeremiah was coming to pass. And if you
[44:33] like Gabriel's instruction uh to Daniel,
[44:36] brother Bam said that's why Gabriel came
[44:38] to Daniel was to instruct him because he
[44:41] was in prayer and fasting concerning the
[44:44] things which he had been reading in the
[44:46] book. He he was reading books, you know,
[44:48] and desperation came from what he was
[44:50] reading. I I I could take a few minutes
[44:52] here. I don't think we will. I'll just
[44:54] say this, brother Bam, in in in Gabel's
[44:56] instruction, he goes into the end time
[44:59] prophecies and he begins to say, I
[45:01] understand by the book
[45:04] &gt;&gt; and he starts laying out things that
[45:06] were happening and how that it ought to
[45:09] anoint our faith to know that the season
[45:12] has arrived that changes is upon us. I
[45:15] understand when you start understanding
[45:17] the things that are happen supposed to
[45:19] happen that day then you see it then you
[45:21] know the season is changing. Now in the
[45:24] book of Daniel Daniel in the ninth
[45:25] chapter he then actually sees amen not
[45:29] only that the 70 years are finishing. So
[45:32] let me just put this in quick chronology
[45:35] that the children of Israel have
[45:36] returned from Egypt and they're living
[45:38] in Israel. They built up their temple.
[45:40] They're living in Jerusalem. They fall
[45:42] into sin. They separate into Israel and
[45:44] Judah. And then Nebuchadnezzar comes in,
[45:47] destroys their temple, and packs them
[45:49] all off under prophecy of Jeremiah. And
[45:52] they stay down there for 70 years. And
[45:55] at the end of that 70 years, Daniel's
[45:58] praying, realizing that we're fisting to
[46:01] return to Jerusalem and rebuild the
[46:02] temple. And God begins to show him that
[46:05] this is the season. But then he sends
[46:07] Gabriel to him and begins to instruct
[46:10] him on six different reasons that they
[46:14] will have 70 weeks. So you see a period
[46:17] of time. God names it with them 400
[46:19] years. Was God right?
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; God says 70 years. And was God right?
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; God names the season. Now, that same God
[46:30] that had just hit two out of two says to
[46:33] Daniel, "I'm going to give your people
[46:35] 70 weeks."
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Now, don't go don't go to sleep on 70
[46:39] weeks for me, okay?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stay long here.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; 70 weeks are prophetic weeks.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a lot of calendars, right?
[46:49] There's the astrology calendar, Julian
[46:51] calendar, the Roman calendar. Well,
[46:53] there's also the prophetic calendar. How
[46:56] many ever seen a Jewish calendar?
[46:59] &gt;&gt; They, you know, they run two different
[47:00] calendars, right? There's a prophetic
[47:02] which names their feast and it it runs
[47:06] from the moon and it's a 360day
[47:10] calendar,
[47:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; So, in 360day calendars, each week
[47:15] represents seven years.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about uh was it 490
[47:21] years that God gives them? And brother
[47:23] Bram says, "Watch when when he gave them
[47:25] those weeks, he actually detail details
[47:30] exactly how many weeks from the
[47:32] rebuilding of the walls until the coming
[47:35] of the Messiah." So just as now think of
[47:38] this, just as God gives, he gives times.
[47:40] He gives seasons.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; He gives them 70 weeks. He actually
[47:45] prophesies to them 490 years. Now, this
[47:49] is from the time that they rebuild it
[47:51] all the way to the Messiah. Now, think
[47:53] of this because as a church age, when
[47:56] Jesus comes, remember Jerusalem is
[47:59] destroyed again. And Jesus says that
[48:01] Jerusalem will remain trotten down until
[48:04] the until the time of the Gentiles,
[48:08] &gt;&gt; right? And he calls it the times of the
[48:09] Gentile. Amen. And and then so then we
[48:12] recognize that's dealing with Daniel's
[48:15] prophecies. Amen.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; It's dealing with Daniel's prophecies.
[48:19] And Jesus then is actually determining
[48:22] as the Messiah that he is marking a
[48:25] certain part within them weeks. But
[48:28] after Jesus, watch, they were blinded to
[48:32] make room for the Gentiles
[48:34] &gt;&gt; because Paul says they would until the
[48:36] fullness of the Gentiles, not the time
[48:38] of the Gentiles, the fullness of the
[48:40] Gentiles would come in. So, so the 70
[48:43] weeks that God promises to Israel is
[48:46] stopped at the Messiah
[48:49] &gt;&gt; because they become blinded and then
[48:51] your church age becomes in. And then God
[48:53] gives an opportunity to all of the
[48:56] gentile churches to be saved and he
[48:58] gives a door, an opening, an utterance
[49:00] for them that they might come in. Now,
[49:02] now we can measure that. And just as
[49:05] brother Brandon would say, watch Israel
[49:06] is your time clock. Well, do you know
[49:08] the Gentile is Israel's time clock?
[49:12] But when when you look at the Gentiles
[49:14] from the book of Revelations, the first
[49:16] couple chapters, you will see quickly in
[49:18] Revelations 1, that he has seven stars
[49:21] in his hand. Remember the Lord appears
[49:24] seven stars in his right hand and seven
[49:26] golden candlesticks. And the mystery of
[49:28] those stars are they the seven angels to
[49:31] the seven churches. Now before there was
[49:34] calendars, there was stars.
[49:37] So the Gentiles told their time by the
[49:40] stars.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; So we seen the first age of Paul and we
[49:44] seen how the stars come out of the hand
[49:46] of God. How the time click of prophecy
[49:49] was just being poured out in the ages
[49:51] and we called it the times of the
[49:52] Gentiles and we're waiting for the
[49:54] fullness of the Gentiles. But when that
[49:56] seventh angel begins to sound, that
[49:59] brings a fullness unto the Gentile age
[50:03] and it fulfills the scriptures
[50:05] concerning the Gentiles. Amen. So, watch
[50:08] what you're doing. You're living in the
[50:10] season that God said to his Israel
[50:13] people, I have some time left for you,
[50:16] but it can't start until this bride's
[50:19] out of the way. Right?
[50:21] &gt;&gt; See, God has made a promise to the Jew
[50:24] that he will give them another three and
[50:26] a half weeks that he made promise, but
[50:28] he'll never give them that weeks until
[50:31] this bride is out of the way. Now, go
[50:33] right back to the story of Joseph and
[50:35] see if Joseph didn't have a gentile
[50:37] bride and he kept that bride with him,
[50:39] but he never would reveal himself to his
[50:41] brethren. As long as that bride was
[50:44] sitting there, he only spoke to them in
[50:47] Egyptian. They did not know who he was.
[50:49] Though he was there, they didn't know.
[50:51] But the moment that gentile was moved
[50:54] from the fellowship to the palace, he
[50:56] then began to reveal himself to those
[50:58] Jews. Do you see that God will not
[51:01] forgive them Jews and you're the only
[51:04] thing between him and those Jews. So
[51:07] don't you ever for a moment think that
[51:09] God cannot take care of this gentile
[51:12] bride. Everything that you need for a
[51:15] rapture has already been brought in this
[51:17] message. We're not waiting for a
[51:19] messenger. We're not waiting for another
[51:21] leader. We've got a message from God, a
[51:24] rapturing message from God, a
[51:26] vindication from God. Because that's
[51:29] what the Jews were waiting on was this
[51:32] bride to be saved and carried into a
[51:35] rapture.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; The whole thing is hinging on you. the
[51:39] seventh angel released that star and the
[51:42] message then come into the earth which
[51:44] opened a prophetic age.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Now if you're a if you're a a student of
[51:49] of scripture, you know the Bible
[51:52] predicts this that there would be 70
[51:54] weeks. Now how many knows that he also
[51:56] says that the last week would be cut in
[51:58] half.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said and the Messiah shall
[52:02] be cut off in the middle of the week.
[52:07] Now that cut off in the middle of the
[52:09] week, how that's three and a half days.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And how long was Jesus's ministry?
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Three and a half years.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus never went to the Gentiles
[52:22] &gt;&gt; when he was here.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go not unto the Gentiles,
[52:28] &gt;&gt; but to the lost sheep of Israel." That's
[52:29] right.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; So his ministry was only to Israel in
[52:33] those three and a half years.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; They are owed another three and one half
[52:38] years
[52:39] &gt;&gt; in scripture. Now let's watch the
[52:41] seasons. These seasons of course has an
[52:44] objective and it's found in the six-fold
[52:46] purpose of of Gabriel's visit to Daniel.
[52:49] You might go listen to the whole tape. I
[52:50] don't want to put you to sleep. Now,
[52:52] Daniel's 70 weeks, amen, are speaking of
[52:55] a division of of of first and seven
[52:58] weeks and then 62 weeks and then
[53:00] &gt;&gt; and then the last half is what we're
[53:02] looking at today.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Now, if you put 360 days in a prophetic
[53:08] calendar, Brother Bam specifically says
[53:10] there's three and a half years left to
[53:14] the Jews. The messianic doctrine of the
[53:16] Jews, there is still three and a half
[53:19] weeks determined. Uh, brother Brown, I'm
[53:21] going to say it again. In the fifth
[53:22] seal, the second half of the 70th week,
[53:25] remember Messiah was cut off in the
[53:26] middle of the week. That's the middle.
[53:27] Well, half of seven is three and a half.
[53:30] How long did Christ preach? See, there
[53:32] is determined another three and a half
[53:35] years.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Now, you wonder why I'm taking time to
[53:38] read this because some people honestly
[53:40] believe there's seven years left.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And prior to the seals, Brother Bradom
[53:48] alludes to that. Right?
[53:50] &gt;&gt; But you'll see the correction here in
[53:51] the fifth seal. And the reason you'll
[53:53] see it, you watch this. Watch this.
[53:54] Watch the correction come scripturally.
[53:57] He'll say, "Now I give each of you a
[53:59] robe." Now go back to Revelation 6 and
[54:01] see what he said when he given them
[54:03] white robes. What did they say? How
[54:05] long, Lord?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; How long? And he said, "For a season,
[54:13] &gt;&gt; there yet remains a bit of a season."
[54:16] Yeah.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; And this season was how long? Amen. Now,
[54:19] if you turn with me to Revelations 11,
[54:22] watch the scripture. The season. Now,
[54:24] there's to be a season
[54:26] &gt;&gt; because there is an elect Jew left on
[54:29] the earth after the fullness of the
[54:32] Gentiles. Uh, Revelation 11, I believe
[54:36] that's about the second and third verse.
[54:39] Uh, yeah, here it is in third verse. And
[54:42] I will give you power unto my two
[54:43] witnesses. Now, how many knows who them
[54:46] two witnesses are?
[54:48] &gt;&gt; That's Moses and Elijah. That's not the
[54:50] fourth ministry of Moses. Elijah, it's
[54:54] the fifth ministry of Elijah.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; And unto my two witnesses, and they
[54:58] shall prophesy how long? A thousand,
[55:01] 200, and three score days?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Three and one half years.
[55:07] The season that is speaking of in the
[55:09] fifth seal is making room for these two
[55:13] witnesses to preach the gospel in
[55:16] Israel.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Now, isn't it amazing that the Bible is
[55:20] telling us after all of these years that
[55:22] when the fullness of the Gentiles come
[55:24] in that God is going to send two
[55:27] prophets to preach in Israel? Amen.
[55:30] According to Revelations the 7th
[55:32] chapter, they're going to preach in
[55:34] Israel. Now, somebody wants what's
[55:35] what's their message going to be,
[55:37] Brother Wayne?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? What
[55:39] are they going to preach?
[55:41] &gt;&gt; What is those Jews going to preach over
[55:42] there? Moses and Elijah, what are they
[55:44] going to say? Go to Revelations chapter
[55:46] 7 with me. I'm watching the first four
[55:48] verses. Now, see, God could not allow
[55:51] the earth to be destroyed. He couldn't
[55:53] allow the end of the earth because those
[55:55] Jews.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Do you see? And he can't get to those
[55:59] Jews until he moves you.
[56:03] So when the devil wakes you up in the
[56:04] middle of night and says you miss the
[56:05] rapture, say you lying, devil.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Watch Revelation 7. And these things I
[56:14] saw four angels standing on the four
[56:16] corners of the earth, holding the four
[56:17] winds of the earth, that they should not
[56:19] blow on earth, nor the sea, nor in any
[56:22] tree. And I saw another angel ascending
[56:25] from the east, having the seal of the
[56:27] living God. Now what's the seal of the
[56:29] living God? according to Ephesians 4, it
[56:32] is the Holy Ghost.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And he cried with a loud voice to the
[56:36] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[56:38] the earth and the sea, saying, "Hurt not
[56:42] the earth, neither the sea, nor the
[56:43] trees, till we have sealed the servants
[56:46] of God in their foreheads. And I heard
[56:48] the number of them, and they were
[56:51] 144,000, the tribes of Israel." Now,
[56:53] watch this, Brother Brand. I'm going
[56:55] show you quickly that these these is
[56:57] directly tied to the three woes, right?
[56:59] because we're talking about three world
[57:00] wars. When the first world war opened
[57:03] and I I won't take a history, but let's
[57:05] just make statements. Do you know when
[57:07] the first world war it was the first
[57:09] time the whole world went to war?
[57:13] And think about the great war that
[57:15] struck. And and and you you historians
[57:17] know that on the 11th day of the 11th
[57:20] month
[57:22] &gt;&gt; that all of a sudden at 11:00 in the
[57:24] morning,
[57:25] &gt;&gt; the war stopped.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; And they still do not know who said
[57:31] peace.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; But if you read the Bible, you'll know
[57:35] exactly who said stop.
[57:37] The one that had the seal of the living
[57:39] God said, "Hold your peace until these
[57:42] 144,000 have been sealed."
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Watch it." He said, "11th
[57:46] hour of the day, the 11th month." What's
[57:49] it saying? That 11th hour people is
[57:52] going to get the same pay that that
[57:54] first hour people got. You see, God is
[57:57] going to give the Holy Ghost to 144,000
[57:59] Jews. What is these two witnesses going
[58:02] to preach? They're going to preach the
[58:04] same message that you and I are
[58:06] preaching this morning. There is not
[58:08] another gospel. There is not another
[58:11] gospel than the power of the life of
[58:13] Jesus Christ. Somebody said, "But what
[58:15] about the seventh seal?" What is the
[58:17] seventh seal? It is the literal life of
[58:20] almighty God returning to the earth. And
[58:23] that same life, that same grace is going
[58:26] to go over there to those Jews. My
[58:28] there's 144,000 of them that is to be
[58:31] sealed right there. Amen. For the
[58:33] purpose to bring 144,000 in under
[58:36] tribulation. Now, I say it's a very
[58:38] powerful thing. Now, it's 11th hour.
[58:40] It's God's own way of getting them. And
[58:43] as soon as this church, this bride is
[58:45] taken up in the mystery of the seventh
[58:47] seal. We we'll get to these mysteries of
[58:49] the seventh seal, but let me just put it
[58:51] very clearly. Y'all know what opened the
[58:53] seventh seal?
[58:55] Malachi 4.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; The fourth coming of Elijah. it the the
[59:01] cension of the mighty angel is the
[59:03] opening of the seventh seal. And it's
[59:04] real important you see that sir
[59:06] &gt;&gt; because if you can see the seventh seal,
[59:08] it's the mystery of her going. The Jews
[59:11] is called by the mystery of the seventh
[59:14] trumpet
[59:15] &gt;&gt; which is two prophets. You see what he
[59:17] said? What opens the sixth seal is the
[59:20] two prophets. There are two men. Their
[59:22] ministry opens the sixth seal. The same
[59:26] as the seventh angel's ministry opens
[59:28] the seventh seal. Oh, church of the
[59:30] living God. The same thing the trumpets
[59:33] are to Israel, the seals are to this
[59:35] bride. God has opened the door to bring
[59:38] this bride home. This message has called
[59:41] you out. Listen, it's not an accident
[59:43] that in 1948 when Israel is becoming a
[59:46] nation that a prophet is being visited
[59:48] by an angel. It's not an accident that
[59:50] the world went to war at the same time
[59:53] and God gave grace that there might be a
[59:56] hold and instead of destroying Israel in
[59:59] the middle of the world. Listen, what
[1:00:01] did what what did Iman and Hitler have
[1:00:03] on their mind? We'll totally eradicate
[1:00:05] the Jew.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; But what happened?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; The Jew after 2,000 years was given a
[1:00:12] nation of its own. Yeah.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; And what the devil tried to do to
[1:00:17] destroy them, God said, "You can't
[1:00:18] destroy them."
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; I made a promise to them. And in the
[1:00:22] middle of that great destruction, God
[1:00:25] raised up Israel and put them in a place
[1:00:27] and gave them borders and gave them a
[1:00:29] flag and gave them an army. And right
[1:00:31] now, they're roaring like a lion. Amen.
[1:00:34] Because there will be no destruction of
[1:00:36] Israel until 144,000 are saved. Russia,
[1:00:41] you got to hear me. Iran, you're going
[1:00:43] to have to hear me. There will be
[1:00:44] nothing destroy Israel because there's a
[1:00:47] promise over them. Oh, church of the
[1:00:50] living God. If he made that kind of
[1:00:52] promise to Israel, what about this
[1:00:54] bride? There ain't no devil. There ain't
[1:00:57] no power. There ain't nothing that can
[1:00:59] take her. You say, "I'm going through a
[1:01:01] trial. It's just for a season, but God
[1:01:04] made a promise. It'll be a short one."
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah to God.
[1:01:10] Do you see these prophets are coming out
[1:01:12] under these trumpets?
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; When you read your Bible and and you're
[1:01:16] seeing that sixth trumpet, how many read
[1:01:18] about it
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; when the sixth trumpet and the river
[1:01:21] Euphrates is opened up
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden 200,000,000 horsemen
[1:01:25] come riding out of there and there and
[1:01:28] boy, if you read the scripture, man
[1:01:29] tells you about the Chargers and how the
[1:01:31] Brother man said, "Oh, there's not
[1:01:33] 200,000 horsemen in the world today."
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "These are demons." That's
[1:01:38] right.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; He said that have been bound up. These
[1:01:42] are the same demons that destroyed
[1:01:45] Jerusalem under Titus back there when
[1:01:48] Rome crushed the city of Jerusalem. And
[1:01:51] they rose up and they tried to destroy
[1:01:54] Israel again. And they manifested under
[1:01:56] the anointings of Ikeman and Hitler.
[1:01:59] Amen. And Stalin. And look what they was
[1:02:01] doing. But instead of destroying Israel,
[1:02:04] they were pushing them back.
[1:02:09] See, because Israel had gotten where
[1:02:10] they didn't want to go.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to go home.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; They were comfortable in Russia and they
[1:02:16] were comfortable in Germany and and
[1:02:19] Italy and they had started settling
[1:02:21] down.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; But God said, "There's a promise over
[1:02:23] your life.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; You won't be able to settle there."
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Can Can you hear me, church?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't the Russians that went
[1:02:32] back to Jerusalem.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. It wasn't the Italians that went
[1:02:37] back to Jerusalem.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; There might have been some mixed blood,
[1:02:40] but oh no, sir. It was the Jew that
[1:02:42] returned.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Do you see what that is? It's not just
[1:02:46] anybody comes to the homeland of this
[1:02:49] message.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; It's to them that have theophony.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Do you see? You might have a human blood
[1:02:55] and you might be mixed up with some kind
[1:02:56] of a Irish or Italian or amen some kind
[1:03:00] of a English or whatever you're mixed
[1:03:01] in. But I'll say this, before that was
[1:03:04] there, that was a theophony. And this
[1:03:06] message didn't come to push you. It come
[1:03:08] to pull you. There's a third pull
[1:03:11] pulling this bride back into the
[1:03:13] homeland. I hear the call of an eagle.
[1:03:16] There's a season of redemption upon the
[1:03:19] church.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And let me say this. When you hear the
[1:03:21] voice of this eagle, nothing will hold
[1:03:23] you.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; No. No. Come on. The Amish ain't got a
[1:03:28] chance once you hear this.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of you, hey, they we we we
[1:03:33] we we sometimes nickname it ex Amish.
[1:03:35] But I'm going to say very clearly, not
[1:03:37] ex Amish cuz you never were really
[1:03:40] Amish. You always was a child of God.
[1:03:43] And that old Amish devil tried to put
[1:03:45] its hooks in you. But God said, "Not
[1:03:47] this one. It belongs to me." And he
[1:03:49] broke the bonds and brought them here.
[1:03:51] They're sitting here this morning. Amen.
[1:03:53] Not identified in the Amish. Identified
[1:03:56] in the presence of God.
[1:03:59] I know some of the Amish, they try to
[1:04:01] come out and they stay under the
[1:04:02] traditions and all that nonsense. I say
[1:04:04] come out of it if you're going to come
[1:04:05] out. Come out into the free land. Drop
[1:04:08] every fake every tie. If you was a
[1:04:11] Baptist, forget your Baptist. If you
[1:04:14] were a church of Christ, forget your
[1:04:15] church of Christ. We were sons before we
[1:04:19] were on this earth. And when this is all
[1:04:21] done, we'll still be sons. Hallelujah. I
[1:04:25] hear the call. Come out over my people.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; This angel of the Lord has called the
[1:04:32] people back to the genuine atonement of
[1:04:34] the word of God. Not a bunch of
[1:04:36] Pentecostal traditions. Not a bunch of
[1:04:38] nonsense and religiosity. I'm so sick of
[1:04:42] religion. I'm so sick of traditions and
[1:04:44] ideas and man-made doctrines. Amen.
[1:04:47] Forget all of it. We've got a word from
[1:04:50] heaven and it's my identity and there's
[1:04:52] a revival in it for every believer in
[1:04:55] the church of God.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; You see under that sixth trumpet when
[1:05:08] those when those demons started coming
[1:05:10] out after those they they were natural
[1:05:13] demons
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; and they were being manifested in
[1:05:16] shooting and gassing and killing and
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; and brother Bham said but now I didn't
[1:05:23] preach those trumpets because
[1:05:26] I already preached them supernaturally
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; in the seals
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; and he didn't even know it. until 1964
[1:05:35] feast of trumpets.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So you say, "Preacher, so you see what's
[1:05:41] where there's a corner that was turned
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; and brother Bam began to say to you
[1:05:46] things and begin to let you understand
[1:05:48] that his ministry of Revelations 10 was
[1:05:52] calling you back.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; We're not going to have another
[1:05:56] sacrifice.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; He's calling you back to the original
[1:05:59] sacrifice.
[1:06:02] Do do you see then the same demons that
[1:06:07] attack them Jews is spiritually
[1:06:10] attacking you?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Brother Wayne, why am I
[1:06:14] such a battle?" Listen, I tell you,
[1:06:16] there's only one safe place.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Why is my mind a roar? Cuz there's
[1:06:22] 200,000,000
[1:06:23] demons trying to destroy you.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Every gun in hell is pointed at you.
[1:06:29] Every devil has crawled up out of hell
[1:06:32] and they're looking for a member of that
[1:06:34] bride to try to pull down. But brother
[1:06:36] Bam said, "Don't worry." He said, "If
[1:06:38] all of hell is against you," he said,
[1:06:39] "And all of heaven is for you.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee there is more of us than
[1:06:44] there is them. I can count their devils.
[1:06:47] You can't count my angels." Paul said
[1:06:50] it. He said, "You have come unto the
[1:06:51] unnumberable company of angels. You
[1:06:53] cannot put a number on the amount of
[1:06:55] angels that come about me. We are
[1:06:57] encamped by a host of angels.
[1:07:00] Uncountable number of God's angels that
[1:07:03] are here in this building this morning.
[1:07:05] I I know. Amen. Some people don't like
[1:07:07] it, but I'll just say it very clearly.
[1:07:08] There's an angel in this church.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord. You say, "How do
[1:07:14] you know?" Because he always accompanies
[1:07:16] his message. Hallelujah. That same
[1:07:20] pillar of fire that led the children of
[1:07:22] Israel is right here in this building
[1:07:25] this morning.
[1:07:26] leading us into the conquering power of
[1:07:30] the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; My
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's under that sixth trumpet. But
[1:07:38] the seventh trumpet opens under them two
[1:07:40] prophets and three and a half years is
[1:07:42] given back to them Jews. But brother
[1:07:44] Ma'am said, notice three prophets come
[1:07:45] out right there. He said one to the
[1:07:48] Gentile and two to the Jews. Now you
[1:07:51] know that the son of man once the
[1:07:53] dispensation changes it don't go back to
[1:07:56] son of god.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Come on church. It never returns to son
[1:08:01] of god. It remains prophetic from now to
[1:08:04] the time of the millennial kingdom. You
[1:08:07] are a prophetic people. We are not
[1:08:09] prophets but we are the fulfillment of a
[1:08:12] prophet's prophecy. We have rose up out
[1:08:14] of the scriptures. We have rose up out
[1:08:16] of the denominations and the graves of
[1:08:19] tradition to stand
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; as a mighty army.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You see, do you see when you look at
[1:08:27] this?
[1:08:29] Brother man said, "Do you see them
[1:08:30] trumpets sounded under that sixth seal?"
[1:08:32] And I've done preached it
[1:08:34] supernaturally.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; I've done preached it supernaturally.
[1:08:39] What is it? It was to rush them Jews
[1:08:41] back to their homeland.
[1:08:44] See, a season is coming.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Watch in Hosea chapter 6. This is a
[1:08:50] sermon recognizing your day and his
[1:08:52] message.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hosea 6 and verse one. Come and let us
[1:08:56] return unto the Lord
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; for he hath torn
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; and he will heal us.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; For he hath smitten, but he will bind us
[1:09:05] up. He's talking to the Jews.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And after two days,
[1:09:10] he will revive us. and in the third day
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; he will raise us up and we shall live
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; in his sight.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Now, brother M said that was written
[1:09:20] over 2,700 years ago.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you see that's not the
[1:09:23] Gentile?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; That's the Jew."
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Look, they're already
[1:09:29] gathered."
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Now, how should she be born in a day if
[1:09:33] she had to be gathered?
[1:09:35] But all this while while this Joseph's
[1:09:39] wife is still with him,
[1:09:42] he's been putting the brethren
[1:09:45] over there in Israel,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; waiting for their revival.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Nation could be born in a day. Look,
[1:09:52] look, look at the grace of God. Return
[1:09:55] to the Lord. Now, if you're if you like
[1:09:56] to study Brother Bram's approaches, it's
[1:09:59] pretty amazing because when he gets in
[1:10:00] this recognizing your day, he tells the
[1:10:02] vision of the bride. How many ever heard
[1:10:04] him tell it? The preview and he talks
[1:10:06] about the bride goes down perfect bride
[1:10:08] and he said then they start coming and
[1:10:10] he said they fall off this way and they
[1:10:12] fall off this way and they fall off. He
[1:10:14] said but when it comes to that last
[1:10:15] bride
[1:10:17] remember brother Bam said I saw that lay
[1:10:19] oysanian church.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Remember that one
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; and she was under that boogie woogie and
[1:10:25] naked
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; wearing a gray plastic material.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said I never thought of it
[1:10:29] till just now. miserable, blind,
[1:10:32] wretched, naked. Leodysa,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; he said that Le Oysa bride boogie woogie
[1:10:37] and twisting the rocket. Brother Bam
[1:10:38] said naked. He said it was a horrible
[1:10:40] scene. And in the presence of the angel,
[1:10:42] brother Bram saw it. He said, "I become
[1:10:44] so ashamed."
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Is this all I could produce?"
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; With this great message, this is all I
[1:10:52] could produce. He said, "Then I heard
[1:10:55] that music
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; and he said, I said, "Oh, there's going
[1:10:59] to be a bride."
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I looked up and he said
[1:11:03] that first bride that had went down was
[1:11:06] coming back again now." And he said,
[1:11:08] "Here she come." Remember, she was
[1:11:09] dressed now, not Jewish. She was in all
[1:11:12] of the nations of the earth. Brother
[1:11:13] said, "Dressed in her national garb. And
[1:11:15] here she come." He said, "Walking right
[1:11:18] to that beat." And he, boy, you talk
[1:11:20] about a prophet. And brother brother
[1:11:22] Kyle now we we got a real prophet
[1:11:24] because when he sees that vision
[1:11:25] remember somebody in the back started
[1:11:27] started getting out of line a little bit
[1:11:29] and brother Bram corrects his own
[1:11:30] vision.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Get back in line.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; He knew that would be a perfect bride.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see that? He didn't
[1:11:39] say she wasn't bride. He said get back
[1:11:40] in line.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; If you if you get to fooling around with
[1:11:43] something and you realize it, you get a
[1:11:45] little out of step. I already heard him
[1:11:47] say it. Get back in line. He's talking
[1:11:50] to people that's already been in line.
[1:11:52] He's talking to people that's already
[1:11:54] been lined up. They're already under a
[1:11:56] message, but somebody got you a little
[1:11:58] get you a little idea here and a little
[1:12:00] idea there. Somebody said, "Brother
[1:12:01] Brand wasn't right here or there."
[1:12:02] Brother Ram said that out of line was
[1:12:04] they was doubting me.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? Amen. Somebody said,
[1:12:08] "Well, can somebody come back from
[1:12:09] that?" You bet you they can.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; You bet you they can. You say, "There's
[1:12:13] no way." You don't know the grace that
[1:12:15] what I'm talking about yet.
[1:12:19] You say, "Well, they blasphemed the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost." I agree that's blasphemy. But
[1:12:23] does God mark it? That's the question.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that's blasphemy." I agree
[1:12:29] it's blasphemy. I agree. But do you know
[1:12:31] a true believer cannot blasphe?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; I got scripture I can stack on your head
[1:12:39] for a week, but let me give you the best
[1:12:41] one I got. He that is born of God cannot
[1:12:45] commit sin. for he cannot sin because
[1:12:48] the seed of God remainth in him. I want
[1:12:52] scripture. I'm glad you asked. What
[1:12:54] about you, Apostle Paul? How would Paul
[1:12:56] ever make it if that was the case? But
[1:12:58] Paul was a gene seed of almighty God.
[1:13:01] And while he was speaking against the
[1:13:04] blood and speaking against Jesus Christ,
[1:13:06] there was a seed inside of him. And when
[1:13:09] the pillar of fire came, it removed all
[1:13:12] of the doubt and all of the sin and
[1:13:14] called him back to God.
[1:13:19] What about you, doubting Peter? What
[1:13:21] about you?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Stripped all your clothes off and went
[1:13:24] fishing, cussed out somebody so you
[1:13:26] wouldn't have to be identified with this
[1:13:28] crucified Christ. But the minute he
[1:13:30] resurrected, he looked around and saw
[1:13:32] the brethren. And he said, "Where's
[1:13:34] Peter? Somebody go get Peter."
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he had not forgotten him.
[1:13:40] And he ain't forgotten you and he ain't
[1:13:42] forgotten Israel.
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:46] So, wow. I tell you,
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; it's recorded in scripture. It's real.
[1:13:50] It's it's it's scripturally. It's not.
[1:13:52] Brother Bram is a scriptural prophet,
[1:13:53] folks.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; He's a scriptural prophet.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You read Revelation 7. You You You do me
[1:14:01] a favor. When you get home, read it. And
[1:14:03] I want you to notice that there are
[1:14:05] 144,000 brought out of 12 tribes. And he
[1:14:08] names every tribe. But if you're a Bible
[1:14:11] reader, you know that two of them tribes
[1:14:14] is wrong.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Two of them tribes have been taken out
[1:14:18] and two more have been put in.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Dan and Ephraim has been taken out and
[1:14:22] the others have been placed in their
[1:14:24] place. And somebody said, "How in the
[1:14:26] world did that happen?" I'll tell you
[1:14:27] how it happened. all the way back there
[1:14:29] years ago when Israel was having trouble
[1:14:33] and and and Israel and Judah divided.
[1:14:35] What they did is Israel said, "We don't
[1:14:38] want the people going down to Jerusalem
[1:14:40] and worshiping because we might lose our
[1:14:42] influence. So, we're going to build us a
[1:14:44] couple gold c." Do you see where that
[1:14:45] old devil go? You see that? You see that
[1:14:47] devil?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I can't let my people go to that meeting
[1:14:50] cuz man,
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; if one meeting would deceive you, I'm a
[1:14:54] sorry preacher.
[1:14:58] If one meeting would wipe somebody out,
[1:15:01] my goodness.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; I You ain't saying much for the seed
[1:15:05] life, are you?
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; My Bible said, Amen. that they cannot be
[1:15:12] deceived.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Only for a season.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Go back and read it and see. See if that
[1:15:23] God didn't when they when they worshiped
[1:15:25] those golden calves and y'all remember
[1:15:27] the story coming out of Egypt. Remember
[1:15:29] Aaron made a golden calf.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Remember that?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And when they made that golden calf, the
[1:15:35] Levites made that. Aaron did.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And then here we are hundred years later
[1:15:40] and Dan and Ephraim builds a golden calf
[1:15:43] just like Aaron did.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Is not this the God that
[1:15:48] brought us out of Egypt?"
[1:15:51] Everybody knew the story of Egypt, but
[1:15:53] they were placing the glory of Jehovah,
[1:15:55] that pillar of fire,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; on that money-making scheme of
[1:15:58] denomination.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Is not this the God that'll get you in
[1:16:04] rapture?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Do you see religion? It's same.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; It never changes
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; money-making scheme.
[1:16:15] But God cursed the idea of worshiping
[1:16:19] idols.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said any man that would do
[1:16:22] it, his name would be blotted out from
[1:16:24] under the heavens.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; But when God realigns for the millennial
[1:16:31] kingdom
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; in Revelations the 14th chapter and also
[1:16:35] in the book of Ezekiel,
[1:16:37] this Dan and Ephraim are right back in
[1:16:40] tribal order. Yes,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; sir. Yeah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Showing you that God can remember sin,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; but he also can forget it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That he can take that and because of his
[1:16:52] word, he says it. But then God actually
[1:16:54] will allow them right back in tribal
[1:16:57] order during the millennium. Do you see
[1:17:00] all Israel, that's the seventh seal, by
[1:17:02] the way, you can go listen to it. That's
[1:17:04] all of Israel
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; shall
[1:17:08] be saved. Right.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; All of Israel
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; shall be saved. Won't you stand to your
[1:17:15] feet with me this morning,
[1:17:21] all of Israel.
[1:17:29] When Joseph started revealing himself to
[1:17:31] his brethren,
[1:17:34] he just started weeping.
[1:17:36] This is him. This is our brother.
[1:17:40] But grace was right there.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Do you know it's recorded in the book of
[1:17:46] Zechariah
[1:17:48] that in the 10th verse that I'll pour
[1:17:50] upon the house of David and upon the
[1:17:51] inhabitants of Jerusalem with the spirit
[1:17:53] of grace and supplications.
[1:17:55] And they that look upon me that they
[1:17:57] have pierced shall mourn for him as one
[1:18:00] mourneth for his only son
[1:18:03] and shall be in bitterness of the
[1:18:05] firstborn. And in that day there will be
[1:18:08] a great mourning in Jerusalem in the
[1:18:09] morning of Hendrin in the valley of
[1:18:11] Megodon and the land shall mourn.
[1:18:15] Do you know that Israel
[1:18:18] every fall after the feast of trumpets
[1:18:20] they worship a day called the day of
[1:18:22] atonement.
[1:18:27] And the feast of trumpets were being
[1:18:28] sounded under Hitler in the Second World
[1:18:31] War.
[1:18:33] So they're there right now waiting
[1:18:36] for the feast of atonement. Now they
[1:18:39] think they're there to build a
[1:18:40] millennial temple. They think they're
[1:18:43] there to raise a rad heer that they
[1:18:45] might be able to sacrifice.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Traditionally, that's what they're
[1:18:49] doing. But God's got them there
[1:18:52] because there's going to be two
[1:18:53] witnesses rise up
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; and they're going to do the sign of a
[1:18:57] prophet
[1:19:00] and they're going to realize
[1:19:03] that the Messiah they're looking to come
[1:19:05] they had crucified 2,000 years ago.
[1:19:09] This feast of atonement will become a
[1:19:11] feast of mourning
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; because they'll realize the lamb has
[1:19:16] already been slain. And they'll gather
[1:19:18] in their houses and they'll say unto
[1:19:21] him, "Where did you get those scars?"
[1:19:24] In the house
[1:19:26] of my friends.
[1:19:29] Amen. Brother Ben, you sing this song.

[1:28:07] I believe it's time to blow the trumpet
[1:28:09] in Zion.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; I I believe it is. I believe it's time
[1:28:12] to blow the trumpet in Zion and tell the
[1:28:14] people, "Amen. Awake, Israel."
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this this this world events
[1:28:21] that we're facing. I you know, I I I I'm
[1:28:24] not a prophet or the son of a prophet,
[1:28:26] but I'll say this. I read my Bible and I
[1:28:29] hear this message
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and we are living
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; in the last moments of the last days of
[1:28:35] time.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; The these things don't have to be
[1:28:40] created or they just have to be put in
[1:28:42] action.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; We're sitting here on the on the brink
[1:28:45] of some of the greatest changes in
[1:28:47] history.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Time will never be the same after Israel
[1:28:52] attacked Iran.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing will ever be the same. from that
[1:28:57] day.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; It'll never go back to normal.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Not now.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; It won't.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; You said, "Preacher, what are we waiting
[1:29:06] on?" There's one.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; There's one.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Just one. Somebody said, "Well, well, I
[1:29:13] I think there's got to be maybe the
[1:29:14] whole church has got to come into
[1:29:16] adoption at one time."
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Now, if you ever have you ever drove by
[1:29:20] a field in the late summer,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; and seen half of its gold and part of it
[1:29:25] green,
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:27] I'll tell you this, there is some very
[1:29:29] golden grain in this church.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; There's some very golden grain in this
[1:29:34] bride.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; There might be some green left, but wait
[1:29:37] just a minute. She's laying in the
[1:29:38] presence.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; She's going to ripen up.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; She's going to ripen up. It's It's going
[1:29:43] home time, folks.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; It's It's the going home time. Amen. I
[1:29:48] don't know if it's in order, but I feel
[1:29:50] like it. Amen. What about that song,
[1:29:52] Blow the Trump in Zion? I I I don't
[1:29:55] know. Uh, I just feel it in my bones.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to blow a trumpet.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what the gospel is
[1:30:01] doing, isn't it?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; It's sounding It's sounding the alarm to
[1:30:05] the people.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody high on the wall has said,
[1:30:08] "Babylon, Babylon is great. Is fallen is
[1:30:11] falling." Amen. Come out of her, my
[1:30:13] people. I heard the call.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; I heard that bride gathering. And in
[1:30:16] that mystery, the seven seals, she's a
[1:30:18] go. There's two prophets arriving.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's the season of redemption.
[1:30:24] Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; And I believe we're living right in the
[1:30:26] middle of it. And I thank God that our
[1:30:27] eyes are wide open to it.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They rush on the city.
