[6:06] between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea
[6:08] both of them have inlets but only one of
[6:10] them has an outlet and when a church

[6:21] amen and take this light amen uh we want
[6:24] to thank you for that and I I just want
[6:27] to this morning we have some uh word
[6:29] here from the book of
[6:31] Ephesians the 2 chapter uh the 19th
[6:35] verse down to the 22nd amen um I I pray
[6:39] these Series has been okay with you uh
[6:42] it's been an interesting study for me
[6:45] personally and I pray that it's a
[6:46] blessing to you Ephesians chapter 2
[6:49] verse
[6:51] 19-22 now therefore ye are no more
[6:54] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[6:58] citizens with the same Saints and of the
[7:02] household of God I don't know how much
[7:06] deep I'll get into that household of God
[7:08] but in God's provided place in
[7:11] 1965 I believe it is in Louisiana
[7:14] brother mam deals with that a little bit
[7:16] the household of God and I'll probably
[7:18] get it into the next chapter but uh if
[7:21] you want to look into that it's God's
[7:22] provided place of worship the household
[7:25] of God and are built upon the foundation
[7:30] of Apostles and Prophets and Jesus
[7:34] Christ himself being the Chief
[7:37] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[7:41] fitly Fring together
[7:43] groweth and holy Temple in the Lord in
[7:47] whom ye also I like that inclusion don't
[7:51] you in whom ye also are builded together
[7:57] for a habitation of God
[8:00] through the spirit we ask the Lord to
[8:02] bless his reading this morning I want to
[8:05] speak to you today on Holy habitations
[8:08] you could be seated uh I want to speak
[8:10] to you from that last line there I want
[8:13] to speak to you about holy
[8:15] habitations amen that's a very powerful
[8:19] word that that Apostle Paul has spoke to
[8:22] a people that he just laid out the idea
[8:26] uh Thursday we were there that you had
[8:29] no business in the Commonwealth of
[8:32] Israel you had no hope and were without
[8:35] God lost in the world and that has now
[8:40] transitioned that you are now the holy
[8:43] habitation of almighty God I mean what a
[8:47] transformation what a reality that God
[8:50] has brought us to now the scripture will
[8:52] tell us here amen that Paul is saying
[8:55] this whole building is fit together but
[8:58] it is built of on the foundation of the
[9:02] Apostles and the prophets and Jesus
[9:04] being the Chief Cornerstone it is built
[9:07] upon the foundation of the Apostles and
[9:10] the prophets I I think that's powerful
[9:12] personally amen if you want to know what
[9:15] kind of building you're going to get
[9:16] look at the foundation that you have
[9:19] amen if you're going to build a 20 by2
[9:21] shop you're not going to lay a 100 by
[9:23] 100 Foundation amen the foundation is a
[9:26] reflection of what is coming and and if
[9:29] the foundation are Apostles and Prophets
[9:32] what's going to be set on it amen Jesus
[9:35] Christ being the Cornerstone also will
[9:38] be the Capstone now in Revelation
[9:40] chapter 3 brother bam will tie these two
[9:43] scriptures together from Ephesians
[9:44] chapter 2 and he'll tie this to and him
[9:48] that overcometh will I make a pillar in
[9:50] the temple of my God and he shall go no
[9:53] more out and I will write upon him the
[9:56] name of my God and the name of the city
[10:00] of my God which is the New Jerusalem
[10:03] which cometh down out of Heaven from my
[10:05] God and I will write up on him my new
[10:09] name brother Bram uses this and he says
[10:11] see him that overcometh in Philadelphia
[10:14] and age he said I will make the pillar
[10:16] in the temple of God a pillar or a
[10:18] foundation a foundation in the temple of
[10:21] the house of God the Temple of my God
[10:24] the house of my God it's a pillar the
[10:26] foundation there's those that took the
[10:29] word here in verse 8 and went back to
[10:31] the foundation in Ephesians 2:9 over in
[10:34] the Church of Ephesus you know uh you go
[10:37] back to Ephesus you're going back to the
[10:40] beginning amen let's go back to Ephesus
[10:43] with Paul see the church was established
[10:45] and let's see now all right the church
[10:48] Ephesus let's go back now and see the
[10:50] foundation back there and see that Paul
[10:53] the foundation in the first church he's
[10:55] talking about the Ephesians that he's
[10:58] saying that he that is a pillar of I'll
[11:01] make him a pillar I'll make him in the
[11:03] original church I'll put him back in the
[11:06] original uh I like it here out of the uh
[11:09] 1960 as the church ages here brother M
[11:12] said I will give him see and I will make
[11:15] him a pillar in other words a part of
[11:18] that Foundation what will I give him now
[11:21] this is very powerful and important to
[11:23] the rest of our service I'll put in him
[11:26] the doctrine of the apost Les and
[11:30] prophets from the beginning and give him
[11:33] the
[11:34] Revelation I will make him a pillar in
[11:36] the house of God I will put in him the
[11:40] doctrine amen it now that's that's
[11:42] that's going a long ways from reading a
[11:45] Doctrine and from hearing a Doctrine but
[11:48] he said I will place in him the doctrine
[11:52] amen and give him the Revelation amen
[11:55] that's what it is what did the prophet
[11:57] say about him he's the C counselor the
[11:59] peace the Mighty God the Everlasting
[12:02] father see and he that overcomes all
[12:05] this synagogue of Satan keeps himself
[12:07] free I'll make him a pillar I'll put him
[12:10] back in the foundation of my word in the
[12:13] house of my god oh I'll put him right
[12:15] there in the pillar in the foundation
[12:18] you stay right with that word see what
[12:20] is it when he's a pillar he's not going
[12:22] out anymore amen uh uh from the uh same
[12:26] same book here he says he's a pillar he
[12:28] ain't going out no more he's the bride
[12:32] amen he there it is you're going back to
[12:35] the Ephesus you're going back to Paul
[12:38] that's what it is amen he has made him a
[12:41] pillar in the house of God he has put
[12:44] the doctrine in him he's not going out
[12:47] anymore I think it's amazing when you
[12:50] look at habitations and you look at the
[12:52] habitation of God because actually a God
[12:56] who we know as the invisible God a god
[13:00] whom the heavens couldn't hold nor the
[13:02] Earth could contain but the Bible tells
[13:05] us that he desired to dwell among
[13:08] men in the first temple that we realized
[13:11] God had built was when God had Moses to
[13:14] build him a house it was God that told
[13:18] Moses to build a meeting place and and
[13:21] y'all remember that when he told him to
[13:23] build the meeting place it was out in
[13:25] the wilderness of sini and he was going
[13:27] to build a place and that place was
[13:30] going to be a temporary dwelling and
[13:33] something that could move along with
[13:34] them throughout the Wilderness Journey
[13:37] it was a place that would house the word
[13:39] and it would be able to be moved now
[13:41] it's amazing because when Moses made the
[13:44] things this Tabernacle he made it like
[13:47] the things he saw in heaven when Moses
[13:50] built the Tabernacle on the earth he
[13:53] made it like what he saw it in the
[13:55] heavens uh when he made these he laid
[13:58] them out now in Hebrews chapter 8 you'll
[14:01] read it in the fifth verse Who Shall
[14:03] Serve unto the example and Shadow of
[14:06] heavenly things as Moses was admonished
[14:08] of God when he was about to make the
[14:10] Tabernacle see he saith thou shal make
[14:14] all things according to the pattern
[14:16] showed to thee in the mount so Moses saw
[14:19] it in the mount in Hebrews 9 and
[14:22] 2423 and it was therefore necessary that
[14:25] the pattern of things in the heavens
[14:26] should be purified with these but the
[14:29] Heavenly things themselves with better
[14:31] sacrifice than these so he was seeing
[14:33] that in the heavens there had to be
[14:35] sacrifice and in the earth there had to
[14:37] be sacrific in the heavens there was a
[14:39] temple and upon the Earth there was a
[14:41] temple and the thing that was built in
[14:44] the Earth was only a pattern of what he
[14:46] saw in the heavens now if you've ever I
[14:48] wish I probably could should have
[14:50] brought a picture but if you've ever
[14:51] seen the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[14:53] drawled in a picture it's draw with
[14:55] three different courts remember the
[14:57] outer Court was where all the people
[14:59] camped and there was your daans and your
[15:01] chorus and there was all the mumblers
[15:03] the grumblers mixed in with the
[15:05] Believers and they were all out there
[15:07] and then there was a next phase of that
[15:09] Court as they approached the word there
[15:11] was the next phase of that where they
[15:13] come into the inner court and there in
[15:15] the inner Court they they they had that
[15:17] where the Brazen Altar and the approach
[15:20] last Thursday I spoke the approach to
[15:22] God they had to come to the Brazen Altar
[15:24] and then the Laver and then they come
[15:27] into the holy place where the
[15:29] candlesticks were and then we walk right
[15:31] into that place amen of of the of the
[15:34] holies of holies where they would come
[15:36] into the word of God now when you see
[15:40] that pattern you see three different
[15:42] phases of that pattern there's the
[15:43] outside the inside and the inside of the
[15:46] inside amen and we see that very pattern
[15:49] laid over the human being we see a body
[15:52] we got a spirit and we have a soul right
[15:55] so there's three phases of it the same
[15:57] as it was there there is also Al in man
[16:00] then the pattern that Moses was building
[16:03] was to show you that God's original plan
[16:06] is to dwell in a man that's God's
[16:09] original plan and being that God
[16:11] couldn't dwell in man he had to build a
[16:14] temporary place that would be a shadow
[16:17] of what he was going to do so he had a
[16:19] temporary dwelling place with temporary
[16:22] uh atonements and temporary symbols that
[16:25] was set there but every one of them was
[16:27] saying that God wanted wanted to dwell
[16:29] with a man he wanted to dwell upon the
[16:31] earth now it was shown in David's desire
[16:34] when you go back in the uh the book of
[16:36] kings and you find that David wanted to
[16:39] build God a house remember he wanted to
[16:41] take that God that he had saw in the
[16:43] Tabernacle and and and he said how is it
[16:46] that I dwell in a house of Cedar and my
[16:48] God dwell in the tents out there and and
[16:51] and he wanted to he wanted to make a
[16:53] place for his God it was a great it was
[16:55] a great thing on his heart and even the
[16:57] prophet said to him said David do all
[16:59] that is in thine heart and and it was
[17:01] then that then the prophet had to come
[17:03] back and God spoke to him and said you
[17:05] go tell David it's a good thing that he
[17:07] wants to do but there's too much blood
[17:09] on his hands and he'll not be able to
[17:11] build me a house he said but oh how be
[17:13] it when Solomon comes I'll let his son
[17:17] build me a house and remember then David
[17:20] wasn't building a house but he was
[17:21] building the material for the house
[17:24] right and he was making preparations for
[17:25] it to come because then Solomon would be
[17:28] the one that would be able to put
[17:30] together the house in 40 Years of
[17:32] Silence it would be stacked together
[17:34] brother M goes through this in a message
[17:36] dedication and he said look at the
[17:37] material that they had he said it didn't
[17:39] all come from bluon he said it all
[17:41] didn't come from uh Lima he said see it
[17:44] come from different parts of the world
[17:46] and it was shaped in different places
[17:48] but when it come together he said it fit
[17:50] perfectly because there was a design see
[17:53] Solomon never ever deviated from the
[17:56] design that Moses had and mo Moses had
[17:59] brought it to a place now Solomon was
[18:01] going to make it in a in in a in a place
[18:03] where they could have it solid it's
[18:05] amazing I was reading the scriptures
[18:07] last night that when Solomon began to
[18:09] build this Altar and he began to build
[18:11] this H this Temple amen that the word
[18:14] already existed right amen and they had
[18:16] to carry the word and place it in that
[18:19] temple in a certain spot and the Bible
[18:22] records that when they put the word in
[18:25] there and the and the and the word fell
[18:27] into its sockets the Bible records that
[18:30] the glory of God filled the house and so
[18:32] that they wasn't able see because the
[18:34] word had come to its place it had it had
[18:37] come to a resting place the the city
[18:40] that it was coming to was Jerusalem the
[18:43] place it was coming to was the Third
[18:46] Realm of man into the soul and it was
[18:48] all symbol because it was a natural City
[18:51] and it was a natural building amen but
[18:53] it spoke of another city that would come
[18:55] one day it would be a New Jerusalem
[18:58] called the bride of Christ and they
[19:00] would be the bride and in them is where
[19:02] the word belongs and when the word Finds
[19:05] Its sockets in the soul of a Believer
[19:08] there is where the glory of the Lord
[19:10] will fill the house amen where they were
[19:12] sting I I I think of this because I see
[19:16] that it was even Solomon when he began
[19:18] to witness the glory of this in First
[19:20] Kings chapter 8 in the 27th verse I
[19:23] amazed at reading this he said will God
[19:26] indeed dwell on the Earth he asked the
[19:29] question will God dwell on the earth the
[19:32] god of Heaven can you imagine behold the
[19:35] Heaven and the heaven of Heavens cannot
[19:37] contain thee how much less the house
[19:39] that I have build it did God dwell with
[19:43] a man listen this is exactly what Isaiah
[19:45] asked in Isaiah 66 And1 he said thus
[19:48] sayith the Lord for Heaven is my throne
[19:52] and Earth is my foot stol what house
[19:54] shall you build unto me and where is the
[19:57] place of my rest this was a Prophet this
[20:01] was a pro Isaiah wrote the whole Bible
[20:03] in 66 books of his own of his own book
[20:06] 66 chapters and he is asking where is
[20:10] the place of my rest where could a god
[20:14] dwell that can't fit in the heavens
[20:16] where could a god dwell that the Earth
[20:18] itself is his creation and the univers
[20:20] is of universes but God brother Ram said
[20:24] is a person and he desires a Dwelling
[20:27] Place he desires a home come on now you
[20:30] you that like your home and you love
[20:33] having a house and you love being able
[20:35] to be there and you just enjoy it it's
[20:37] because you're getting that from
[20:39] somewhere else there's something made
[20:42] you that way it's that Dove nature on
[20:44] the inside of you it's a home loving
[20:49] bird it wants a place to call home God
[20:53] desired it and it's not until Matthew 16
[20:56] that the the real son of David Jesus
[21:00] Christ comes along and he said I say
[21:03] unto thou Peter on this rock I will
[21:07] build my church isn't that amazing that
[21:10] the the the son of David the natural son
[21:13] was the one that built the Tabernacle
[21:15] where the word was going to dwell but
[21:17] here's the real son of David here's
[21:20] Jesus Christ himself and he said I will
[21:23] build another Temple and this won't be
[21:25] like that one that Solomon had that they
[21:27] could tear down amen but he would build
[21:30] another and it would be called his
[21:31] church it would be a temple of it and I
[21:34] can I say this to you this morning and
[21:36] you forgive me if I skip ahead a little
[21:37] bit but I I would say this to you that
[21:40] Jesus said 2,000 years ago I will build
[21:43] my church but I believe this morning
[21:45] that we could say Amen that he has built
[21:48] a church amen I would say that he's not
[21:51] looking for a church I say the church
[21:54] has been built by the grace of God we
[21:56] have come from the bottom and we're all
[21:58] the way up to the top this morning we
[22:01] have been seeing the building of the
[22:03] church now I could see give it to you in
[22:05] the countdown brother man said the
[22:07] achievements of man he said man has
[22:08] achieved to get to the moon he said but
[22:11] what is God's achievement made in this
[22:13] age what has God achieved in this age he
[22:16] has achieved a church amen that every
[22:19] word of this Bible can be released in
[22:22] that church he's got a church this
[22:24] morning that the word could come into
[22:27] glory to God he's got a church this
[22:29] morning that there's not one word of
[22:32] this Bible that we are resisting this
[22:34] morning there's not one word of this
[22:37] message that we resist this morning
[22:39] because God is not building a church he
[22:42] has a
[22:43] church
[22:45] Hallelujah he's got a
[22:49] bride
[22:50] Hallelujah in Acts the 7th chapter it's
[22:53] in the book of Acts it's amazing in the
[22:55] book of Acts is this is where Steven
[22:58] says the 44th verse our fathers had the
[23:00] Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness
[23:02] and had appointed speaking unto Moses
[23:05] that they should make it according to
[23:06] the fashion they had seen which also our
[23:09] fathers that came and brought Jesus into
[23:11] possession of the Gentiles whom God
[23:13] drave out before the face of our fathers
[23:15] under the days of David who found favor
[23:18] before God and desired to build a
[23:20] tabernacle for the god of Jacob but
[23:23] Solomon build him a house but how be it
[23:25] the most high dwelleth not in temples
[23:28] made with
[23:29] hands as saith the prophets now he's
[23:33] tying together Solomon's house with high
[23:36] he don't dwell in buildings made with
[23:38] hands as saith the prophets with
[23:40] Isaiah's prophecy Heaven is my throne
[23:43] and Earth is my foot stol and what house
[23:45] will you build me sayith the Lord what
[23:47] is the place of my rest now if you're
[23:50] reading brother brandham he he he takes
[23:52] this out of the message as Statue of the
[23:55] perfect man and he takes acts 7 and then
[23:57] he reads Paul right behind it in Hebrews
[24:00] 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he cometh
[24:03] into the world he saith sacrifice and
[24:07] offerings thou wouldest not but a body
[24:11] thou Hast prepared
[24:13] me oh my but a body thou Hast prepared
[24:17] me now what is this of course brother
[24:19] random is reading two scriptures
[24:22] together and preaching the stature of a
[24:25] perfect man it's a powerful thing to me
[24:29] brother R said what is it then the
[24:30] Tabernacle is now a body what's he
[24:34] saying God doesn't dwell in temples made
[24:37] with hands but Paul said but a body thou
[24:40] Hast prepared me then what is it the

[25:26] brother Bram said see Sten is speaking
[25:28] our fathers found favor before God and
[25:31] Solomon built him a temple but how be it
[25:33] the most high dwelleth not in temples
[25:35] made with hands you ever wonder what
[25:37] that really meant he dwelleth not in
[25:39] temples made by hands what he's saying
[25:41] is is God was there but he wasn't going
[25:43] to stay there he doesn't it wasn't a
[25:46] final resting place for God he was there
[25:48] but he wasn't going to stay there

[30:54] them angels in the presence of God could
[30:56] shake the temple how about hearing the
[30:58] millions of them that are there right

[31:31] religion that doesn't have emotion in it
[31:34] is dead and it needs to be buried amen

[38:45] 3 and ver9 for now you are labors with
[38:48] God and you are God's
[38:50] husbandry and God's husbandry you are
[38:53] God's Building yeah now according to the
[38:55] grace of God which is given unto me wise
[38:57] master builder I've laid a foundation
[38:59] another builth there on but let every
[39:01] man take heed how he builth there upon
[39:05] that's yes sir for other foundations can
[39:09] no man lay than that is laid which is
[39:12] Jesus Christ now if any man build this
[39:15] Foundation of gold silver precious
[39:17] stones wood hay or stubble Every Man's
[39:20] work shall be made
[39:23] manifest well if this is a work that God
[39:27] is using Us in I want you to stand the
[39:32] test I want you to be able to stand the
[39:34] fire when the fire comes I want you to
[39:37] have a word I want you to have an
[39:42] answer for if any man's work abide which
[39:45] he builth thereup he shall receive a war
[39:47] if any man's work shall be burned he
[39:50] shall suffer a loss but he himself can
[39:52] be saved so as by
[39:55] fire now know you not that you are the
[39:59] temple of God now this is Paul look what
[40:03] he's saying now folks he's talking about
[40:07] Jehovah he's talking about Jehovah God
[40:10] and then he's talking to individual
[40:13] people and he said know ye not that ye
[40:16] are the temple of God and the spirit of
[40:20] God dwelleth in
[40:23] you now folks that's heavy stuff
[40:28] now it's written again in 2 Corinthians
[40:31] 6:16 Paul says it again and what
[40:35] agreement hath the temple of God with
[40:37] Idols for you are the Temple of the
[40:40] Living
[40:41] God as God have said I will dwell in
[40:44] them I will walk in them I will be their
[40:46] God and they shall be my people as God
[40:52] hath said look where Paul went to he's a
[40:56] builder
[40:58] he's a builder and he knows if he builds
[41:01] wrong he'll lose his work but Paul was
[41:04] not building on I think it could
[41:07] be Paul was not building the church on
[41:10] foundations of well I think if you did
[41:13] this maybe this and and and I no he says
[41:16] as God hath said look at where he's
[41:19] building now I can take you to couple of
[41:21] the scriptures it's not exact but this
[41:23] is what Paul is talking about in
[41:25] Leviticus 26:11 I will set the T tacle
[41:27] among you my soul shall not abore you I
[41:30] will walk among you and I will be your
[41:33] God and ye shall be my people in
[41:36] Jeremiah 31:33 but this shall be the
[41:38] Covenant that I will make with the house
[41:40] of Israel after those days saeth the
[41:42] Lord I will put my law in their inward
[41:45] parts and right in their hearts and I
[41:47] will be their God and they shall be my
[41:51] people in Ezekiel 37:26 and 27 moreover
[41:55] I will make a covenant of peace with
[41:57] thee them it shall be an Everlasting
[41:58] Covenant and I will place them and
[42:01] multiply them and I will set my
[42:03] sanctuary in the midst of them forever
[42:05] more from my Tabernacle also shall be
[42:08] with them I will be their God and they
[42:12] shall be my
[42:14] people God ha said look at what Paul is
[42:18] saying God has said I'll tell you what
[42:20] God Said more than that in the New
[42:22] Testament can you imagine when Paul
[42:25] learned what Jesus had to say in Matthew
[42:27] 28 teaching them to observe all things
[42:30] whatsoever I command to you I am with
[42:32] you always even till the end of the
[42:36] world look at this Paul is now hearing
[42:39] the prophets coming out of Jesus's mouth
[42:43] and he never changes than God has
[42:46] said see what Jesus said God has said I
[42:50] will dwell with you I will walk with you
[42:53] I will be with thee until the end in
[42:55] John 14 and 15 to 23 very powerful
[42:58] scriptures if you love me keep my
[43:00] Commandments and I will pray the father
[43:02] that he shall give you another comforter
[43:05] and that he will abide with you forever
[43:08] some people actually use this scripture
[43:10] to tell there's a difference between
[43:12] Jesus and the Holy Spirit so let's read
[43:14] on even the spirit of Truth whom the
[43:17] world cannot receive because it seeth
[43:20] him not neither knoweth him but ye know
[43:24] him for he dwelleth with you
[43:27] you and shall be in you I will not leave
[43:32] you comfortless I will come to you yes
[43:35] sir I will come to you look those
[43:39] trinitarian fathers when the seals were
[43:41] preached they looked back to the
[43:43] trinitarian teachings and said brother
[43:45] randam you're wrong but if you had it in
[43:47] you to be a pillar in the house of God
[43:50] let the revelation of the doctrine of
[43:51] the Apostles come into your heart I will
[43:54] not only be with you I will be in you
[43:59] God will send the Holy Spirit then Jesus
[44:02] says I will come to you yet a little
[44:04] while and the world seeth me no more but
[44:07] ye see me because I live ye live also
[44:10] there's your two resurrections brother
[44:11] Bram uses and at that day that's this
[44:14] day you shall know that I am in my
[44:16] father and ye and me and I in you
[44:18] brother BR said the day when the
[44:19] Revelation is made known right if you in
[44:22] John the 10th chapter they said Jesus
[44:24] tell us who you are and Jesus said unto
[44:26] them I don't do The Works my father
[44:28] doeth The Works that you may see that I
[44:30] am the father and the father in me but
[44:32] now he's added another level and he said
[44:35] I'm the father the father in me and I in
[44:37] you and you in
[44:39] me so he added you after the Redemptive
[44:42] work he could make you the Tabernacle to
[44:49] display the image of God look what he
[44:51] does and my and at that day you shall
[44:54] know he that hath my Commandments
[44:56] keepeth him and he that that his love he
[44:58] loveth me shall be L to my father and I
[45:00] will love him and will manifest myself
[45:02] to him and Jes Judas said unto him not
[45:04] as scar it Lord how is it that thou will
[45:07] manifest thyself to us and not unto the
[45:09] world and Jesus said unto him if a man
[45:12] love me he will keep my wordss and my
[45:16] father will love him and we will come
[45:20] unto him and make our
[45:23] Abode make our
[45:25] dwelling see we will come into
[45:31] him now watch this now in Romans the 8th
[45:34] chapter it's Paul again in the ninth
[45:36] verse but ye are not in the flesh but in
[45:39] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[45:42] God dwell in you see we'll make our
[45:46] Abode with him now Jesus himself said I
[45:50] and the father are one same same
[45:52] scripture and when you see me you see
[45:54] the father it was the word with the
[45:56] spirit of manifestation coming into the
[45:59] church now watch this the spirit of God
[46:01] dwell in you and if any man have not the
[46:03] spirit he is none of them and if Christ
[46:05] be in you the body is dead because of
[46:07] sin but the spirit is life because of
[46:09] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[46:11] that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in
[46:13] you he that raised Christ from the dead
[46:15] shall also Quicken your mortal
[46:17] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[46:23] you now we're not talking about a coming
[46:25] and going we're talking about a dwelling
[46:28] we're talking about an abode he didn't
[46:30] want to visit you he wanted to live in
[46:33] you come on church when you're up he's
[46:36] in you when you're down he's in you when
[46:39] you're sideways he's in you he said I
[46:42] want to make my Abode my dwelling my
[46:45] resting place with
[46:47] you now we're talking about another
[46:49] level all together I'm not talking about
[46:51] Pentecostal Holy Ghost folks I'm not
[46:53] talking about a baptism on the spirit
[46:55] and when your spirit Changes Everything
[46:58] Changes I'm talking about a God that
[47:00] dwells in the soul of
[47:04] [Applause]
[47:06] mankind now I love this scripture I
[47:09] maybe I'm not going to preach on but I
[47:10] got to throw it in here you are of God
[47:12] little children and he that overcometh
[47:14] them because greater is
[47:16] he that is in you than he that is in
[47:19] this world I just want the devil to hear
[47:22] that greater is he that is in you than
[47:25] the bad day you're had Heaven greater is
[47:28] he that is in you than the cancer that's
[47:30] attacking your body greater is he that's
[47:32] in you than the Temptation amen the
[47:35] burning passion that's upon your life
[47:37] greater is he that is in you than he
[47:40] that is in this world who is the he
[47:42] that's in you it's God inside the church
[47:46] dwelling as he promised as God has
[47:51] said in Psalms 132: 13 David is a
[47:56] David's is a powerful preacher
[47:58] folks for the Lord ha chosen Zion and he
[48:02] has desired it for
[48:06] habitation hey man y'all know brother
[48:08] brandom said when you read
[48:10] Zion he said you're reading about the
[48:14] bride let me let me let me shock you
[48:17] just for a moment you didn't choose you
[48:20] God chose
[48:23] you Gentiles wasn't even invited in the
[48:26] court at this time and David said God is
[48:29] Desiring Zion that's what God wants is
[48:33] Zion and it wasn't just the city of Zion
[48:36] it's the bride Zion I desire it for
[48:42] habitation this is my rest
[48:45] forever the 14th verse this is my rest
[48:48] forever here will I
[48:51] dwell for I have desired it now we
[48:55] understand Paul's words in Colossians 1
[48:56] and 27 to whom God would make known what
[48:59] is the riches of his glory the mystery
[49:03] among the Gentiles Christ in you can I
[49:07] change it the desire of
[49:09] habitation Christ in you the desire of
[49:13] Glory Christ in you the hope of glory
[49:16] this not your hope it's his hope you
[49:20] wasn't saved by your desire you're saved
[49:23] by God's desire
[49:26] come on brother you sent them roses to
[49:28] her brother Mike when you started dating
[49:30] her amen was that you or
[49:33] her was it your desire or
[49:36] hers amen because he picked out somebody
[49:39] he wanted and the desire was there so he
[49:42] dated and he chased until he had
[49:47] possessed that's right are you hearing
[49:50] me he came looking for
[49:53] you amen he tore down the middle wall
[49:57] that was between you and him he he took
[50:00] the laws that provoked the laws that
[50:04] wouldn't let him live in you and he
[50:06] nailed them to the cross and he
[50:09] abolished every law that would forbid
[50:12] him a habitation in the Church of the
[50:14] Living God he abolished it in his death
[50:17] amen The Joy set before
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] him brother I feel like turning inside
[50:24] out
[50:26] the joy that was before him the joy was
[50:29] you it was tabernacling in you it wasn't
[50:33] just church joining it wasn't just
[50:35] coming together and patting our hands it
[50:37] was god Jehovah God the god of Jacob the
[50:41] god of Moses wanted a resting
[50:45] [Applause]
[50:46] place the place to
[50:54] dwell Christ in you
[50:57] the hope of
[51:00] glory there's a bunch of words we could
[51:02] place
[51:03] there now where we're standing today we
[51:06] can look at the names of
[51:08] Jehovah and there there's seven of them
[51:10] I'm not going to stand here and preach
[51:11] on the seven names but all of them are
[51:13] the names of redemption right but the
[51:16] last name of Jehovah that he revealed
[51:18] was sha am I saying that correctly
[51:20] somebody with Hebrew Jehovah shama
[51:23] Jehovah sha means the Lord is is present
[51:27] yeah yeah okay what good would it do if
[51:31] he was a Healer and he wasn't here he's
[51:33] a savior but he ain't here he's a
[51:35] counselor but he ain't here so sha
[51:39] speaks the Lord is
[51:41] present in Ezekiel 48:35 it was Ezekiel
[51:45] said it was round about 18,000 measures
[51:47] and the name of the city from that day
[51:49] shall be the Lord is
[51:53] there my what a name for a city
[51:57] so brother Wayne what are you saying
[51:59] about this bride I'm saying the name of
[52:00] this city is the Lord is there
[52:03] yeah so I I I've never through the years
[52:06] I remember growing up and I I remember
[52:08] it being a real a real tag in the
[52:11] message people would say he's here and
[52:13] everybody shout and as a young preacher
[52:15] I didn't really understand what they
[52:17] were saying but I I got an idea that
[52:20] they were talking about his presence and
[52:23] and and I I had an idea that they were
[52:24] talking about seven seal and third po
[52:26] you know what I mean but to really
[52:28] Encompass what that meant I really
[52:31] couldn't but as we studied through the
[52:34] years it was when the question came to
[52:36] me when somebody HED he's here and then
[52:39] I said but
[52:43] where he's here but where and most of
[52:47] the people shouting he was here was
[52:49] turning back 40 years to a
[52:53] prophet and they were showing you
[52:55] manifestations in a Prophet or they were
[52:57] looking some personality that was Among
[52:59] Us and they were looking up like this
[53:01] the Lord is here and he's using this man
[53:04] and he's using this Prophet amen but
[53:06] here through the study of the message of
[53:09] the hour comes and develops the thought
[53:11] the Lord is here in his holy Temple in
[53:15] his habitation he's
[53:18] home yes yes he's at home the lights are
[53:22] on and Jesus is at home where's his home
[53:26] where his bride
[53:28] is where is he he's in his
[53:33] temples he is here his name is Jehovah
[53:37] Shah the Lord is
[53:41] there can I just can I just show you
[53:44] that you are a
[53:46] city a city in Revelation 21 and verse 2
[53:49] John said I saw a holy city a New
[53:53] Jerusalem coming from God out of God out
[53:56] of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[53:59] for her husband brother B said as a
[54:01] bride because it is the
[54:04] bride he says it very clear Philadelphia
[54:06] Church Age The Bride is the New
[54:09] Jerusalem preacher what are you talking
[54:11] about the old Jerusalem amen it
[54:13] crucified the Lord yeah it was a carinal
[54:16] Jerusalem you the New Jerusalem a city
[54:20] not made with hands how be it the most
[54:24] high dwelleth not in tabern Les made by
[54:27] hands but a body thou Hast prepared me
[54:31] as a bride adorned for her
[54:35] husband in the third verse and I Heard a
[54:37] Voice from Heaven saying behold the
[54:38] Tabernacle of God is with me with men
[54:41] and he will dwell with them and shall be
[54:43] their people and God himself shall be
[54:46] with them he is their God so when you
[54:49] read of the New Jerusalem and you read
[54:50] of her 12 gates her Apostles and you
[54:53] read of the tribes of Israel and you
[54:55] read about the street and the cities
[54:57] when you get down to it he said but
[54:59] there was no need of a light in this
[55:02] city because the lamb is the light of
[55:05] this
[55:08] city you heard brother Bram teach it
[55:10] strongly he said we've had Campbell
[55:11] light and we've had Luther light and
[55:13] we've had this light we've had this
[55:14] light that's brandom
[55:18] light he said but what we need is Christ
[55:24] Light now I I I I know you people people
[55:26] are well taught so I'm I'm not digging
[55:28] up any bones but if somebody's on the
[55:29] side of this let me just give you a
[55:30] scripture John said I was a light for a
[55:35] season he was a light for a season but
[55:37] when the True Light
[55:38] Came William Brandon was a light for a
[55:41] season but William brandom wasn't the
[55:44] message he's the
[55:46] messenger God help us this morning
[55:48] brother brandom ain't going to live in
[55:50] you but the one he introduced is still
[55:53] here he's still in the midst of the
[55:56] Church the Vindicated word is still in
[55:59] the
[56:01] people hallelujah he's the light of the
[56:04] city it can be said of that City the
[56:06] Lord is

[56:21] you see him I see the light of it
[56:26] I see the light of that City you said
[56:28] preacher you're going off on the rails
[56:30] no a city is a habitation yeah people
[56:33] live in a city this is a holy city it is
[56:38] a holy habitation it's where God and His
[56:41] angels and the spirit of God dwells in
[56:44] that City you want to find God is not in
[56:46] lay out of sea no more
[56:50] folks I am not allowed to see it amen I
[56:54] am a member of the Bride of the New
[56:57] Jerusalem Church that has come down in
[56:59] this age we have been taken back by the
[57:02] word to the first day
[57:05] again Hallelujah huj come on I show you
[57:08] Seven Cities natural on Earth but those
[57:10] cities represented spirits that were in
[57:13] people and they were called
[57:14] philadelphians and leans and Ephesians
[57:17] and they were called sardans amen but we
[57:19] are not Le
[57:22] toia 40y old Moses said I refuse to be
[57:26] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter and
[57:28] I refuse to be called cold and blind and
[57:31] riched and miserable and naked for God
[57:34] ha brought me out to the rising of the
[57:37] Sun and now the Lord dwells
[57:43] there it's a four squared City brother
[57:46] Guthrie it's built on the foundations of
[57:49] Apostles and Prophets and brought up
[57:50] into a holy habitation of almighty God
[57:53] if you don't believe it in Revelation 17
[57:55] the Bible speaks of mystery Babylon and
[57:58] it says she has become the habitation of
[58:00] every unclean and hateful bird mystery
[58:03] Babylon is a habitation of devils the
[58:06] New Jerusalem the mystery New Jerusalem
[58:08] is a habitation of God the Lord is there
[58:12] and I could look and see in denomination
[58:14] I tell you the Lord ain't
[58:17] there he doesn't dwell in it he doesn't
[58:20] live in it it's the habitation of
[58:22] unclean and hateful Birds what is it now
[58:26] God has given to this age as prophecy in
[58:30] Isaiah 59 he said so they that fear the
[58:33] name from the West the glory the rising
[58:35] of the sun when the enemy shall come
[58:36] like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[58:38] shall lift up a standard against it when
[58:41] the enemy comes we've seen it but what
[58:43] God is going to do that's the question
[58:45] the enemy's come we've seen all that but
[58:47] what is God
[58:48] doing the Redeemer shall come to
[58:53] Zion the Redeemer shall appear he shall
[58:56] come to Zion in Psalms 2:6 David said
[58:59] yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill
[59:03] of
[59:04] Zion these are these are these are
[59:06] powerful scriptures 1 Peter chapter 2
[59:08] and verse4 to coming un the living Stone
[59:10] this allowed indeed of men but chosen of
[59:12] God and precious these are Lively
[59:17] Stones built up to a spiritual house a
[59:20] holy priesthood to offer spiritual
[59:23] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[59:25] Christ wherefore also it is contained in
[59:28] the scripture I lay in Zion a Chief
[59:30] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[59:33] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[59:36] and unto you therefore which believe he
[59:38] is precious but unto them disobedient
[59:40] the stone which the builders disallowed
[59:42] is made the head of the corner isn't
[59:44] that something we've seen the
[59:45] Cornerstone become the
[59:48] Capstone we have seen the alpha become
[59:50] the
[59:52] Omega and I in Malachi chapter 3 it's
[59:56] been very one of my vvor favorite lately
[59:58] just it's one of those lately Scriptures
[1:00:01] it it's been it's really stuck out to me
[1:00:03] behold I send my messenger who shall
[1:00:05] prepare the way before me and the Lord
[1:00:07] whom you seek shall suddenly come to his
[1:00:14] Temple Lord that you're seeking is going
[1:00:17] to come to his Temple he's going to come
[1:00:19] to his Temple for it's written in Isaiah
[1:00:22] 2 and3 for out of Zion shall go the law
[1:00:24] of God
[1:00:26] so preacher what are you talking about
[1:00:28] I'm talking about God coming to his own
[1:00:31] Throne have you asked yourself why in
[1:00:34] Psalms and in Hebrews both Paul asked
[1:00:36] the question what is a man that God is
[1:00:38] mindful of him why is it that Psalms
[1:00:41] that David ask what is a man that thou
[1:00:43] art mind for him why are you mindful of
[1:00:47] a man
[1:00:49] God why not just let him go his own
[1:00:51] route why not just throw him away when
[1:00:54] they get to a certain place and let's
[1:00:56] just cast them why are you mindful of
[1:00:58] this man yeah wouldn't it be something
[1:01:01] if you looked at your own life and You'
[1:01:03] seen the situations you seen God pick
[1:01:05] you up and bring you back and pick you
[1:01:06] up and bring you back and you seen work
[1:01:08] and work and work and work after a while
[1:01:09] you turn around and say God why are you
[1:01:11] so mindful of
[1:01:14] me isn't this something brother Isaac
[1:01:16] you're not an afterthought of God and
[1:01:19] God is Not absent minded so if he ever
[1:01:22] had the first thought of you he still
[1:01:24] got the same thought he thought of you
[1:01:26] and there's nobody can change his
[1:01:27] thought nobody can alter his thought so
[1:01:30] if he thought of you as bride in the end
[1:01:33] you're going to be bride and that is why
[1:01:35] God is mindful of a man because man is
[1:01:38] God's
[1:01:39] habitation because man is the Throne of
[1:01:42] almighty God your heart is the seed of
[1:01:45] Mercy in the last day I got hundreds of
[1:01:48] quotes I won't be able to take them but
[1:01:50] I'll say this your heart is the heart is
[1:01:52] the throne where God lives that's why he
[1:01:55] is mindful to his church that's why he
[1:01:58] allows the battles but he never
[1:02:00] quits brother right because God because
[1:02:05] God's Throne is a human heart Unity One
[1:02:08] God 1958 God's heart human heart is
[1:02:11] God's Throne God wants to set on your
[1:02:14] heart's Throne so brother wayang where
[1:02:17] we come where are we at in this age I'll
[1:02:19] tell you we've come to Zion we're not at
[1:02:22] the mount thei we have come to Zion
[1:02:25] where we have come to the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ you said preacher how far has it
[1:02:29] come I'll tell you how far it's come
[1:02:31] Elohim is back in the
[1:02:35] bride Elohim now resides in The Bride of
[1:02:40] Jesus thing see God is becoming tangible
[1:02:43] in his own
[1:02:47] church it's a promise let me give it to
[1:02:50] you the same Jesus in Bride
[1:02:54] form same power same church same word
[1:02:59] Christ The Mystery of God revealed took
[1:03:01] from Colossians 1:27 brother man said
[1:03:03] justified in his sight we are his
[1:03:05] victory the church is his victory we
[1:03:08] come forth in the last day with the
[1:03:10] Glorious gospel showing his victory he
[1:03:13] died for this
[1:03:16] purpose we are proof of his
[1:03:19] victory when we see him coming
[1:03:23] down and living among the
[1:03:29] church when we see him coming down and
[1:03:34] living among the
[1:03:38] church you know you know good and well
[1:03:41] how many times you heard brother Braham
[1:03:42] say it's not
[1:03:44] me I don't know your thought I don't
[1:03:48] know you I don't know where you're from
[1:03:50] I don't know your room number I don't
[1:03:52] know your house number I don't know your
[1:03:54] name I don't know that but there's one
[1:03:56] here that
[1:03:57] does remember then he would switch and
[1:03:59] say your house number is so and so your
[1:04:02] name is so and so and when you were a
[1:04:04] little kid this happened that happened
[1:04:05] what was he doing he was showing you the
[1:04:09] presence of
[1:04:12] God now he was dividing he was dividing
[1:04:16] the humanity from The God Who Lived in
[1:04:19] humanity a son of
[1:04:22] man revealing thee son son of man in
[1:04:27] Revelations 10 out of Heaven come
[1:04:29] another Mighty angel watching he has a
[1:04:32] book
[1:04:33] open in his
[1:04:35] hands what's this open book in his hands
[1:04:39] now watch when the enemy comes like a
[1:04:41] flood let's go to that scripture the
[1:04:44] spirit of God will raise a standard now
[1:04:46] what's the standard what brother say it
[1:04:47] was he said the word would become
[1:04:51] flesh Isaiah said the Redeemer would
[1:04:54] come into Zion
[1:04:57] the word would come in the only thing
[1:04:59] that can defeat Satan is the word so the
[1:05:02] word would come into the church now now
[1:05:05] there's a real meaning to this because
[1:05:07] the word is going to come into the
[1:05:09] church that's what we're looking for
[1:05:12] amen there's actually a there's actually
[1:05:14] a quote here where brother random says
[1:05:17] it will be the spirit spoken
[1:05:21] word in the unveiling of God brother Ram
[1:05:24] speaks it like this and he says watch he
[1:05:26] said God had to get behind a human
[1:05:31] Veil to speak natural
[1:05:34] words to be placed behind a natural
[1:05:38] Veil and then Moses was Moses
[1:05:42] again but between that time Moses had to
[1:05:45] Veil his face because he became God to
[1:05:48] the
[1:05:49] people because he was speaking the words
[1:05:53] of
[1:05:54] God now when those words were compiled
[1:05:57] into the into the book you know what
[1:05:59] they done with that book that word that
[1:06:00] was spoken by that
[1:06:02] Prophet They Carried that book now to me
[1:06:05] it's very powerful They Carried that
[1:06:08] book out see because you had the you
[1:06:11] have the outer courts right so They
[1:06:13] Carried that word through
[1:06:16] that but it didn't stay
[1:06:20] there there was no place for it
[1:06:26] so they carried it through there but
[1:06:28] they didn't stop at the Brazen altar
[1:06:31] yeah or the
[1:06:32] Laver he didn't even stop when you got
[1:06:35] into the holy place where the seven
[1:06:37] candlesticks were there was no place for
[1:06:40] the word to sit there was no resting
[1:06:43] place there was no furniture built for
[1:06:45] it there but it was in that third
[1:06:49] place now I've always loved how brother
[1:06:51] brandom takes it and breaks it
[1:06:52] justification sanctification Holy Ghost
[1:06:55] right yeah so brother so somebody said
[1:06:58] well brother Wayne then there's three
[1:06:59] and then watch what brother B says
[1:07:00] justification made way for
[1:07:02] sanctification and sanctification made
[1:07:05] way for the Holy Ghost but the Holy
[1:07:08] Ghost made way
[1:07:09] for the Holy Ghost himself and let me
[1:07:12] put to brother bram's other words the
[1:07:15] word
[1:07:16] itself so in the third part back there
[1:07:19] in the Holy place in the third step
[1:07:24] that's where the word was yeah right
[1:07:27] because it was a a body it was a spirit
[1:07:31] and it was a soul so the word would
[1:07:34] never rest In the Flesh
[1:07:37] realm the word can never rest In the
[1:07:40] Flesh realm there's too many battles out
[1:07:42] there folks somebody somebody asked me
[1:07:45] the other day they said brother Wayne
[1:07:46] how is it that a person could believe
[1:07:48] the message and then get get LED away or
[1:07:50] how could they start uh uh maybe even uh
[1:07:53] considering ideas that brother Bram
[1:07:55] could been wrong or something I said
[1:07:57] because they're living in the wrong
[1:07:59] place because if you're trying to
[1:08:01] discuss this message with an unbeliever
[1:08:03] you've went to the outer
[1:08:05] courts and you're out there among all
[1:08:09] the unbelief and you're out there among
[1:08:11] the doubts and somebody said well
[1:08:12] preacher amen but it's if it's the word
[1:08:14] of God it ought to hold out there you
[1:08:16] you watch your tip now because the bread
[1:08:18] fell in their six days a week and the
[1:08:22] word said don't you try to hold this
[1:08:24] over for tomorrow
[1:08:26] because if you do it will rot on you the
[1:08:28] word of today will rot yet tomorrow if
[1:08:32] you hold it in a certain atmosphere and
[1:08:34] when you try to entertain an unbeliever
[1:08:38] and discuss brother bram's message as if
[1:08:40] it's a reasoning power you are in a
[1:08:43] place this message will turn to dust on
[1:08:45] you
[1:08:47] overnight because you're in a reasoning
[1:08:49] Channel you said preacher if it was
[1:08:51] God's word eve went to the channel of
[1:08:54] reasoning in the the Garden of Eden and
[1:08:57] God himself was her
[1:09:00] pastor don't go out to that realm and
[1:09:04] discuss this message with that devil if
[1:09:06] he wants to talk about it you tell him
[1:09:09] come on in here with
[1:09:10] [Applause]
[1:09:12] me said preacher what do you mean
[1:09:15] because if he comes with me he's going
[1:09:16] to have to get the Holy Ghost and if you
[1:09:18] ever get the Holy Ghost you'll amen
[1:09:21] every word of it I won't have to
[1:09:23] convince you of it I won't have to beg
[1:09:25] you into it if you ever get the Holy
[1:09:27] Ghost the Holy Ghost sent this
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:35] word but see what it was amen I I I I
[1:09:39] think it's a powerful thought if you
[1:09:40] just take it to brother bram's own
[1:09:42] Ministry and you take it to the first
[1:09:44] pull second pull third pull that's
[1:09:46] exactly the setup right that's exactly
[1:09:49] what brother Brandon was showing you
[1:09:50] three pulls he was showing you he
[1:09:52] preached it in a message inter Veil when
[1:09:54] he talked about the Third
[1:09:56] pull and he said the fire went over that
[1:09:58] little room remember it's an inter Veil
[1:10:01] yeah and Watch What Happens brother
[1:10:03] bandam held the hands of a lot of people
[1:10:06] folks but the word never rested
[1:10:09] there he held hands with a lot of people
[1:10:12] told them their sicknesses told them
[1:10:14] what God was doing he tried to call them
[1:10:16] out but the word never went no further
[1:10:19] than
[1:10:21] that now I've talked to them it was
[1:10:24] people set by the Groves and heard the
[1:10:26] second pool when brother Bram stood
[1:10:28] there under messiah's sign and discerned
[1:10:30] the heart of man and proved that it was
[1:10:32] the resurrection sign of Jesus Christ
[1:10:36] himself proved it without a shadow of a
[1:10:39] doubt we was down in uh Gatlinburg here
[1:10:42] it's been several years back we were
[1:10:44] with a group of of friends family we
[1:10:46] were at a at a ice rink and and uh there
[1:10:49] was a lady sitting up there and to our
[1:10:52] standard she wouldn't have appeared to
[1:10:53] been a Christian uh but she was sitting
[1:10:55] there and she seen everybody sitting
[1:10:57] around there in their skirts and long
[1:10:58] hair and you know and and she looked
[1:11:00] over at my wife and she
[1:11:02] says what do y'all believe and Carissa
[1:11:05] answered her and she said well we follow
[1:11:07] the message of William
[1:11:08] brandom and cuz she knew we the
[1:11:10] conversation would go you're Christian
[1:11:12] yeah well what do y'all believe so she
[1:11:13] just cut the chase she said well she
[1:11:16] said we believe the message of brother
[1:11:17] brandom and the lady said oh I was in
[1:11:20] his
[1:11:21] meetings she said I was back there years
[1:11:23] ago I believe it was in Mississippi it
[1:11:25] and it was her it was yeah it was in
[1:11:27] Mississippi and she was healed of throat
[1:11:29] cancer in them meetings she said my son
[1:11:33] actually is a Full Gospel preacher
[1:11:35] because of the belief of that she said I
[1:11:38] was with brother random in Oregon when
[1:11:40] the maniac was put down before him she
[1:11:42] said I was in those meetings as well but
[1:11:44] you know what I could look at her one
[1:11:47] time and tell you that she never went no
[1:11:49] further than
[1:11:50] that amen and and the anointing was so
[1:11:53] real and she was so CAU up in it and it
[1:11:56] was so great and it was so wonderful but
[1:11:58] it was just in the spirit realm but the
[1:12:01] Bible said the word of God discerns
[1:12:04] between the spirit and the soul of a man
[1:12:06] this message was the first time I ever
[1:12:08] heard anybody say you can have it in
[1:12:10] your spirit but not your soul you can
[1:12:13] have the Holy Ghost every day of your
[1:12:15] life brother bam said and go to hell how
[1:12:18] could it happen brother Wayne because it
[1:12:20] only got in your
[1:12:21] spirit cuz it only went in the spirit
[1:12:24] because you had some reason you couldn't
[1:12:26] let it get in the soul listen folks
[1:12:28] there's one curtain between the holy
[1:12:30] place and the holies of holies that
[1:12:32] curtain the prophet said was
[1:12:34] self-will he said it's self-will and if
[1:12:37] you're going to let the word come in
[1:12:39] amen you can serve God and man at the
[1:12:41] same time you can't serve denomination
[1:12:44] and God at the same time come on the
[1:12:46] third angel of Revelations 14 come and
[1:12:49] said you can't worship the mark of the
[1:12:51] beast and serve God
[1:12:53] too so it's self- will you got to make
[1:12:55] up your mind what is it for me what am I
[1:12:58] going to believe I'm going to believe
[1:12:59] this man or am I going to believe the
[1:13:01] message am I going to believe this
[1:13:02] church or am I going to believe the
[1:13:04] message am I going to stay with the
[1:13:05] Baptist or the Lutheran or the pope or
[1:13:07] who am I going to go to listen the word
[1:13:10] of God is in the beginning was the word
[1:13:14] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:13:17] was made flesh and Jesus was the
[1:13:20] Tabernacle of almighty
[1:13:24] God amen now it never got further than
[1:13:29] that and the Pentecostal World why did
[1:13:32] Pentecost fail I'll tell you why they
[1:13:34] failed cuz they never went further than
[1:13:38] that but oh there's further to
[1:13:42] go that prophet's words had to be
[1:13:46] carried
[1:13:48] past oh God can you imagine when they
[1:13:51] come to the to where the furniture was
[1:13:54] built
[1:13:56] can you imagine the moment that they
[1:13:59] could set the word down and it knew
[1:14:02] that's where it
[1:14:04] belongs they did it when they went the
[1:14:06] holy place in the Tabernacle in the
[1:14:09] wilderness they put the word in his
[1:14:11] place in Solomon's Temple it put the
[1:14:15] word in his place when Jesus was there
[1:14:17] on Calvary the word was in his place and
[1:14:20] this morning God has sent a message to
[1:14:23] you and I to Usher the word into our
[1:14:26] soul realm that it would magnify this
[1:14:29] message in this hour in your life listen
[1:14:32] we don't have to come here this morning
[1:14:33] on a on a on on on the kind of
[1:14:35] experience amen that we're up one day
[1:14:38] and we're lost the next listen amen you
[1:14:40] you don't realize the terror of
[1:14:44] that the preacher why you have all these
[1:14:47] alter calls for these young people and
[1:14:49] why y'all have all these youth events
[1:14:50] and all this I'll tell you why we have
[1:14:52] it because I would I would absolutely
[1:14:55] be terrorized to think that these young
[1:14:58] people have not had an experience with
[1:15:00] that word to get further than their
[1:15:02] feelings further than their emotions if
[1:15:05] they stop in that emotional realm then
[1:15:07] they're saved they're lost they're saved
[1:15:09] they're lost they're saved they're lost
[1:15:11] they're saved they're lost oh but if
[1:15:13] they ever let the word the word richly
[1:15:16] come into that soul you can let them
[1:15:19] face all of hell and they'll say I know
[1:15:22] who I have believed I know God God is in
[1:15:26] my soul this morning the word abideth
[1:15:29] with you I will make my Abode in you I
[1:15:32] tell you when that word makes it into
[1:15:34] the soul of a young person the devil's
[1:15:36] finished right there fashion is finished
[1:15:39] right there unbelief is finished right
[1:15:42] there if you want to help mankind get
[1:15:45] this message in their
[1:15:49] hearts come on folks that's why that's
[1:15:51] why our ministers are out preaching this
[1:15:53] morning that's why we're spending $2 or
[1:15:55] $3,000 a month in translations overseas
[1:15:58] that's why people are giving amen
[1:16:00] offerings to buy uh uh Buy tablets one
[1:16:02] brother up to $10,000 just to buy
[1:16:05] tablets for hubs for for men of God to
[1:16:08] read you know why because this message
[1:16:10] is more than the mind of a man it's more
[1:16:13] than just a bunch of ideas it's more
[1:16:15] it's more than opinions of William
[1:16:18] brandom it is the word of the age it's
[1:16:21] the opening of The Seven Seals and it
[1:16:23] needs a resting place I say God help us
[1:16:26] to build a church that this message can
[1:16:29] rest in their
[1:16:34] souls but a body thou Hast prepared
[1:16:38] me amen when you get born again and
[1:16:41] filled with the Holy Ghost the energy of
[1:16:42] God open your life up the let deity God
[1:16:48] Tabernacle
[1:16:50] himself in you
[1:16:55] testimony of a true witness let the Holy
[1:16:57] Spirit bring into your hearts
[1:17:00] now these things don't count it's
[1:17:03] tabernacling
[1:17:06] deity in our heart that's what
[1:17:09] counts the Holy Ghost is tabernacling
[1:17:16] deity Therefore your bodies are the
[1:17:20] Temple of his
[1:17:23] Dynamics is
[1:17:25] amazing is it amazing that God has
[1:17:28] brought a
[1:17:30] message that wouldn't fit and lay out a
[1:17:38] see can you imagine can you imagine
[1:17:41] carrying a
[1:17:44] message in congregation after
[1:17:46] congregation
[1:17:55] how many message churches was there when
[1:17:57] brother brand
[1:17:59] left he said I only got one
[1:18:04] door per green had
[1:18:07] Tucson and brother Brown preached the
[1:18:09] message what house will you build
[1:18:14] me this message didn't have a
[1:18:18] home it didn't have message pull pits it
[1:18:21] didn't have men of God that are sold out
[1:18:23] to preaching it it didn't have it
[1:18:28] folks but God knew it was
[1:18:32] coming he knew men was
[1:18:34] coming he knew that this message would
[1:18:36] be preached he knew this message would
[1:18:39] be
[1:18:40] believed I'm I'm not saying there wasn't
[1:18:42] any believers back then of course there
[1:18:46] was 98% of them was following William
[1:18:50] brandom
[1:18:55] and very few of them went beyond his
[1:19:00] person now when I put Honor on our
[1:19:03] elders I do it because they respect it
[1:19:06] they earned it when I say something
[1:19:08] about Ray Ericson look folks this man
[1:19:11] was back there in that
[1:19:12] dispensation but he's not there
[1:19:16] now he made the
[1:19:19] corner brother bisc made the corner
[1:19:22] brother meno made the corner these men
[1:19:24] of God helped establish a place to put
[1:19:27] this message now you can see it when
[1:19:30] Samuel goes to anoint a king remember he
[1:19:33] tried all the heads of them Sons but
[1:19:36] there was no place for the anointing to
[1:19:37] go on but there was one more it was that
[1:19:40] last son of Jesse it was David and there
[1:19:43] he could place the anointing he could
[1:19:45] pour the word out and so is it in this
[1:19:47] age this message didn't have a
[1:19:50] place but God has put you together
[1:19:56] that the message might have a
[1:19:58] place think of this that it might be
[1:20:00] able to have you say well well brother
[1:20:02] Wayne what how how do you how do you how
[1:20:05] do you how do you view this I I was just
[1:20:07] I was just studying over it I was
[1:20:08] thinking about this and I I I I want to
[1:20:11] I just say
[1:20:13] this somebody was asking me about this
[1:20:15] picture the other day and uh it's funny
[1:20:18] if our musicians could come somebody
[1:20:19] asked me about the picture the other day
[1:20:21] and they said brother Wayne what about
[1:20:23] that picture I said well you know what
[1:20:25] why are you only asking me about the one
[1:20:29] pitcher cuz we got more than
[1:20:33] one you remember there's that one
[1:20:35] brother B standing in front of that old
[1:20:37] door and that pillar of lights over his

[1:20:57] that you got a picture of this and we
