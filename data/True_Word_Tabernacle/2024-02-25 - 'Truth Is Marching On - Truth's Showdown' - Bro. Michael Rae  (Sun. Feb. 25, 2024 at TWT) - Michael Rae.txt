our gates and amen we uh pray the Lord would just send a tremendous blessing your way today as he's promised uh wherever two or three PR are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them amen and I'm I'm certain that we've already felt his presence today it's a it's actually a special day here at True Word Tabernacle um it's brother Ben's birthday amen God bless you brother B amen we certainly appreciate him and love him and amen it's um I I think he's probably turned about 30 or something maybe 31 amen and amen uh so you never you never know right um but uh it's it's certainly good it's good to have the ministering Brothers amen that are visiting today and I I've seen brother Joe over there and I brother Trevor and brother Zion Edmund are here as well and uh and all the other brothers and God bless you all it's certainly good to have you and actually I think I've seen brother Chris Kavanagh back there somewhere amen God bless you brother Chris good to have you today amen and we're um we're certainly thankful for uh the youth banquet last night um how many enjoyed the banquet amen amen amen it's I I really enjoyed uh the taale of two Banquets I I just thought that was amazing amen it was a it was a tremendous uh thought and we certainly uh appreciate the gift that the Lord has placed in our brother Michael's life and uh of course you all know his grandfather brother Ed bcll and he has he's put blazes all over the world for the message of the hour amen and brother brother bisc and brother Tom Ray there at Cloverdale Bible Way well this is Brother Tom Ray's son and the Lord has just laid in him his own gift and blessed the congregation there and we met him a couple years ago when we were there doing the Cloverdale Bible Way camp and um and I I tell you what what struck my heart so strongly is we were in the prayer line afterward and him and I were praying for some youth together and I seen the heart that was that was poured out for the young people it wasn't just about Ministry or how well could someone could preach but I've seen a real burden to help young people find a place of Deliverance in their life and I and I spoke to brother Nathan I said' I believe that this would be a tremendous blessing uh for the people here and for the young people and we're uh certainly certainly honored to have him amen for us this morning I know um that brother Nathan brother Ronnie worked hard on that banquet but I know Sister Tara and I seen uh I've seen I I've seen a bunch of uh different uh ones there and uh the food and things that were prepared uh we'll maybe get to thanks later but we certainly appreciate all the labor that was done for that Amen in in the youth banquet uh it's certainly a blessing you know some something I found out uh in listening to the prophet if you ever want to hear it it's in the message is there anything too hard for the Lord is anytime God gets ready to be a blessing Satan always tries to block the blessing right whatever whatever God's about to do for you amen Satan will always try somehow to block the blessing and to get your get your spiritual attitude away from this from the word of God or from what God's about to do and he picks Abraham when the Elohim was coming to the tent door and brother Bram said it was a hot evening he said all the cattle that is out there he said the ponds were about dry there was no grass he said everybody was fussing he said Sarah didn't have the latest fashion and she was upset he had her up there on that mountain and and he said there was a lot of things going on there that would have had him out of place and out of condition he said but when Elohim walked to the tent door he greeted him and he spoke to him as Lord and brother B said the reason he could do it is because he was in a spiritual atmosphere that's right to recognize a moment of a visitation from God right and he said see Sarah was in a place like a lot of times when people come to church he said she was out of sorts that's right and see he said and when you're out of sords he said God can move there and you'll completely miss it so you want to be a spiritual attitude when the Holy Spirit begins to move this morning you want something in your heart to recognize that's the Holy Spirit and he's speaking to my situation and whatever Satan has tried to throw at you through the weekend through getting here whatever's happening this morning in your life you have to say to the devil Satan God promised me a visitation this morning and I'm here to receive it and I'm recognizing when the man of God begins to speak there's going to come a word my way and I'm going to go home today have visited with Elohim I'm going to have fellowship with him today he's going to move through this congregation amen and I believe it I believe this morning that the Lord is going to do a tremendous thing among us he made a promise that he would be here and whenever he comes wonderful things are going to happen God's going to bless you today he's going to move but when he comes by your way brother Judah now don't you let it pass you when he comes and speaks to you you say yes Lord that's for me and you just reach out and pull on that word and watch the Holy Spirit just start ministering to needs amen we love him this morning amen and we want to bring the man of God and we certainly appreciate brother Michael Ray and we want to make him very welcome here this morning brother Michael we want you to take your Liberty amen and and do what obey the Lord amen we love you and you're so welcome here this morning if you'd all stand to your feet with us Amen brother Ben if you just have something to break oh how I love youus yes how I love Jesus oh how I love [Music] Jesus oh he amen let's sing that again oh to me let's sing to me he's so wonderful oh to oh you are so wonderful amen sing it just to him now oh to me oh and you are so wonderful oh to me and you are so wonderful oh be because you first oh love [Music] me amen Is that real to you this morning to me you are so wonderful because you first love me amen what a joy and an honor it is to be here this morning I have to figure out how to go from Ultimate right to Ultimate left here in the congregation am man a surround surround congregation here this morning uh it's just such a joy and a honor to be able to standing here we so appreciate the work here and as better Wayne said just I was telling him in the office said man I don't know how come it took to for me 2018 or so 2021 it would have been was it Camp 21 yeah and it was you know for brother Wayne to come up and and be a part of the camp there and I said I regret all the years I didn't get to hear you my goodness so I got we got to play some catchup so and so we're we're just so thankful I do bring GRE brother bisc sister Ruth brother Tom sister Joanne the congregation wanted me to be sure to greet everyone brother Ry I know is at home different ones not feeling well but uh pray the Lord just he's not bound by any distance that's for certain so I know he can meet everybody in their home this morning those that are sick in need he's the Healer man we don't need to go another day each one and I know there's Brothers different ones here their wives are at home sick we're believing for them brother Wayne Amen but in Lord can heal him this morning in a moment we did indeed have a wonderful time yesterday and just what a wow what a banquet that was I went home taking some notes my but Nathan said this is just simple I said wow that's not simple that's just elegant it's so beautiful but Wayne was saying there's every every congregation is those that have just a burden and a love for our young people they're the life they're the lifeblood of a congregation amen that the next gen they're not just the Next Generation you are the generation amen and so we just that's what our burdened desires you catch what God is doing and he becomes personal to you and God's truth marches on Amen I I noted a couple songs that were sung one he's never lost a battle heard that song this morning and then he's the God who fights for me heard that song this morning and then I I I gave the brothers a title but I kind of had a secondary title and I was going to call it truth's Showdown and when there's a showdown that means there's there's a bit of a battle involved you and so maybe God has a bit of a theme this morning man we got a bit of a showdown between our Lord and our and his enemy so maybe we'll just speak about that this morning so you can take your Bibles we'll turn to the word thank you so much buddy God bless you turn to John this morning John 17 sure is just I for me it's a real I can say fearful and a very reverent way to stand behind a Pulpit another Pastor in a congregation I it's a very privileged thing for me to do thank you I might need that you never know oh you want me to switch now all right I'm switching now that was early amen John 17 says I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world Jesus speaking but that thou should us keep them from Evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so I have I even so have I also sent them into the world Amen Jesus is speaking and praying here and I want to focus on that verse sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth that's right and why don't we just pray this morning Heavenly Father Lord we come before your word Lord Desiring that you would speak so individually this morning each one here Lord they've come Lord with a need Lord everybody here has something on their heart or we have burdens that we bear we have situations that we are dealing with Lord maybe loved ones that are astray Lord everybody here has a need and I'm so thankful Lord that your word Lord It's Eternal it's all powerful it's truth and it can meet every need in the presence of this room here this morning Lord and each one even that's listening in maybe from afar Lord your word can speak directly to the heart it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so Lord we commit this morning Lord May Lord you take the people and myself into your hand and Lord that your purpose would be Lord manifested and fulfilled this morning we pray take us Lord we desire you to be here open the word Lord without you this whole meeting is in vain yes Lord Lord so we want you to meet your people this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats this morning read a couple other scriptures just you don't have to turn to them but I'll just reference them here as we start Psalms 105 says for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations amen his truth endureth Psalms 117:2 for for his merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of the Lord endureth forever amen Psalms 145:18 the Lord is nigh unto them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth amen Psalms 119:30 I have chosen the way of truth amen that thy judgments have I laid before me amen truth is is uh is vital it's a vital aspect to to know the truth and Jesus said Thy word is truth and we just going to leave a little have a little bit of a a service this morning focused around that and we'll just speak about the the show down here but uh anybody weary this morning no no nobody's weary wow okay I like it we're ready you know I was looking up you know what um when you're in a battle and we're in a battle anybody here not in a battle amen I know I reversed that one quickly on you everybody's in a battle we're all in a battle you know if you're on the front lines of of a real you know physical battle I could say they say a soldier exerts upwards to 5,000 calories a day okay average for a man or so would be about 2,000 is calories you know plus minus there depending on your gender Etc so 5,000 is an incredible amount of calories that you're exerting to be on the front lines amen so then you wonder maybe why I'm just spiritually taxed or I'm a little weary today CU you've been in a spiritual battle and you're you're fighting amen if you ain't fighting well we should be fighting we should be should be exerting for the kingdom and so then you wonder well why am I a little bit worn down while you're exerting and so then I would also ask then what are you consuming because we got to fill back the energy as we fight we need to we need to pull back on the word amen to pull that energy back in so we need some spiritual calories to be able to fight the enemy cuz the battle I could say is on the battle is on you know there's some there's been some pretty intense battles over the centuries you know the the the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 going back several hundred years they said there was upwards to two million casualties in the Battle there in another battle in in brolof in 1916 1.6 million casualties it was one of the costliest battles known to in in terms of human life in modern history uh there's another battle in the battle I'm don't even going to pronounce this quite correctly nier ner it's World War II battle and it involved almost 4 million troops for both sides stretching across 1,400 kilomet in Miles let's just say that about 900 miles on the Eastern front and the casualties were fatal upwards they say to 1.5 million casualties in the Battle these are these are some some some Wars that have been waged and the cost even just hard to even comprehend the cost of these battles but I would tell you this morning that there's nothing there's no battle in all of mankind and all through the history of humanity that even compares to the battle for truth that battle has waged onwards and onwards through time and there's no way in any battle throughout history that can compare to this one amen it's a war that is waging quite heavily and so it's normal it's normal to be fatigued it's normal to be when you're fighting and so this War's rage better brandham has said now army war he said it's always been War we've never joined the church or come into the church to come to a picnic so I hope you didn't bring your basket this morning you brought your sword this morning amen we don't bring a picnic basket to the gospel to battle front lines I tell you if you pulled out your little Calico or little you know whatever thing you want to call it and spread it out on the ground and get your basket and sandwich out there on the front lines in World War II it didn't happen you brought your gun out Amen brother Brown said it's War not a picnic he said we must realize we're coming to a Battleground I never come for people to Pat me on the back and brother brandom you're just so wonderful no sir I come here with a shield on I don't need a shield for for that he says I come with a helmet and an armor I come to fight fight for every inch of ground amen he says I don't care how much fight for the material things you're going he goes it won't mean one thing cuz it'll Shake but he said but there's one fight that you can get into you and gain grounds and that can never be taken away amen you gain some ground on the enemy this morning it can never be taken away you take possession of your land amen we got a a group of calebs I would say this morning amen he said that it'll never be taken away he says that's the sound of the trumpet of God's word and put in Brackets truth and as he goes as we move on through the evening so if we would go in the message we we're all message Believers here message brother brandham talks about a a trumpet sound he said a trumpet Means War that's right said a trumpet Means War he says you know Through the Ages he said about the church coming in there was trumpet sounded and a seal tore loose he said a trumpet Means War if it don't give a scriptural sound he says what about it he says now each Church age has had its messenger we know that he said Paul was a messenger and when the first trumpet sounded he said the first seal tore loose Paul was the first Messenger as we found what did he do he said he declared war I love that Paul you just say well you read go through acts you go through the different uh different accounts in scripture and the letters to the different churches but if you put it in a different perspective this morning Paul wasn't just riding on pen or going there and and standing on uh on Mars Hill and such he was actually declaring war think about it in that Dimension there was Satan and all of his all of his cohorts of demons and there was Paul preaching the gospel Jesus Christ has come the Messiah is here manifested in flesh he was declaring war that's right declaration of war actually is a formal act by which a state goes to war against another it's a declaration it's a performative speech act you know someone to say well I'm going to go to war we're going to war no it's something there there's actually it's a very formal thing when someone goes to war so God had to anoint a messenger specifically that you're under the authority of Heaven to go out and declare to the enemy the battle's on that's what Paul was doing Paul was going with Corinth and he went with Silas and timotheus that went to Macedonia and Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ amen declaring war there he was with o k King agria he says King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but showed the first but showed first unto them in Damascus and Jerusalem the thought and throughout all the coast and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do the works meet for repentance War that's what he was doing amen he was declaring that that Jesus was the Messiah remember hey this was pretty new this was pretty new you know this was not exactly well we know that no no no this was something absolutely completely contrary to what they had thought they believe this was really a Jew the Messiah it was unfathomable but here God was completely changing and Sh and and turning now them towards the the gospel message and brother Brown said he blasted those synagogues from place to place with scripture and was put out of all of them till finally he shook the dust off his feet and he turned to the Gentiles amen right amen he said what was it it was the sounding of a trumpet he said an angel messenger standing there with the word amen with the word and the scripture says Thy word is truth amen so he's standing there preaching the gospel and blasting out the truth amen he says don't miss that that now the word in Paul with the unadulterated interpretation of God's word and blasted everyone of those synagogues and it cost him he said his life then he said he could go down to irius and if we go through time and Through the Ages each messenger that was going forth was blasting out the truth amen they were declaring war in each age a trumpet would sound and War would go out and there would irenius go through and brother Brown says then St Martin in the next Church age that doctrine of the nicadan would start to creep into the churches and he'd send another messenger say declare war let him know the battle's still on Truth still rages and so then St Martin would go out there and blast through his age and then there with Luther he said the fifth Messenger as he blasted the Catholic church with the word of God and he said the just shall live by faith he said this is not the literal Body of Christ and he threw the communion on the floor and walked out of there he said and blasted that Catholic Church he was trumpeting a sound saying this isn't the truth this is the truth pointing to the word amen he was blasting that out there a trumpet sounding John West raising up in the Anglican Church day he said there's no more reason we have for revivals they were saying and he said it went to see but John Wesley stood up with a message of the second work of Grace and blasted that Anglican church with the gospel of trumpet prepare for war amen then he said through the leodan age they again denominated Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostal he says we're looking for a prophet to come to blast this age and turn them back from their iniquity I to me when I read the message I it just I I kind of chuckle inside at just something kind of tightens up within me because here a prophet is speaking and pointing back to St Martin back to irenius back to Martin Luther back to Wesley and he says there's going to be some Prophet raised up in this day to blast the truth and I'm like there you are you are blasting the truth you are shouting it out you have declared war oh my could you just be in that service I would have wanted to stand up and say you're there war is on on truth is being preached oh my how many just sat in there and listened to the prophet say well we're looking for a prophet to come that won't compromise amen and they're looking at him oh my goodness he says now the Le of see and the Messenger will finish the L of the Le to and seventh angel will finish all the Mysteries that's been lost in the battles before for the truth oh my think about it and here all these truths he talks about Satan had stripped and taken and stripped all through prior battles he says that had been lost he said that's been lost in the battles before for the truth so in these past ages truth had been Stripped Away okay Satan had W there had been battles and Truth had been has been stripped back and here now God was sending a final Messenger to bring truth back to his [Applause] church Luther raised up he said but he didn't have the truth he only had justification right he said' Along Came another messenger would Wesley sanctification he said now watch there's a lot of truth lost out there he said why others compromised on Truth my but this seventh angel don't compromise on nothing oh I'm so thankful that we had a messenger that didn't compromise nothing on one ioda you don't think he had pressure to to to just deviate just a little bit here's just some money here's a lot of money if you could just do this maybe just don't mention this right here don't mention about serpent seed right here don't mention about water baptism right here don't mention baptism in the name of Jesus Christ just don't say that you can have this but there was a messenger that said I will never compromise on this gospel God has anointed me Satan it's time for war all the truth that's been lost in this day every mystery that's going to be revealed is here now and I am that one that's preaching for this gospel oh my I'm so thankful for a messenger that could stand that way but he brought a message to you and I that's the same life force that was driving through him is driving through you and I so that there's a people that will not compromise in this gospel age amen no sir he gathers up all the loose hands gathers them all up at the sounding of this of all the mystery of God should be finished God sent him and all the hidden mysteries was finished when it was revealed to him compromise is to accept standards that are lower than is desirable amen I'd say a people that's Anointed with this Eagle anointing yeah will never cave or Buckle to the the pressure we'll never compromise I know I know that this age is so pressured on you young people and you've got pressures on every angle and every side to to to try and just compromise a little bit on your you know young ladies on your virtues and and on how you conduct yourselves young men and just get to the fashion and maybe our haircuts a little this way and our dress a little bit that way and it's just that pressure that just keeps pressing against you a lot of times the pressure it's not just an instant Force boom it's just this squeeze that's just trying to conform you as you go and walk through your schools and there's a different influences this way and it just is putting that pressure to squeeze you to till you pop essentially but what this message does young people is it puts something inside you it's called the life of the Holy Spirit that's came in this age with the full manifestation of Truth so that it drops inside you a counter pressure because you can't go through this world without something inside you so that as the pressure starts to push on you inside you it starts to push back amen it starts to push back and you start to read the word you start to Tak in the scriptures you get in the message and that's depositing in you a strength and a pressure and as it squeezes you it just pushes out and it just maintains that equilibrium as you walk through the hallways with your head at back and your shoulders straight say I'm a daughter of God and that pressure has no power on you in this day oh amen L BR say these hidden if these are hidden mysteries the man will have to be a prophet right specifically he didn't and didn't we just get through that he's speaking this is all from is this the sign of the end sir and he said in the Battle For Truth them ends have been lost but God said they'd be restored again in this last day amen and here we are in an age where full the full unveiling of Truth All truth is made known in this day and I would say how incredible if we're in the if we're in on a spiritual aspect where all truth is being unveiled and revealed the world on the other hand is so void of Truth my goodness I mean what is truth these days to the world you know just you could look at I don't care what news channel you think about or look at and whatever news you think is true false or fake I me you can't even believe it anymore you're like well is that for real or is that just their idea of of Truth you know and Tech firms are even pulling content because it's false well or is it true and they say it's false and this whole world's confused well do I believe them or is it fox or is it CNN or you know is it BBC I don't know Pick Your Truth huh that's what the world's Happ to do well I'm just going to go with Fox whatever they say it's going to work for me well how do you know well I just got my curated special group of people on my special you know on on X now instead of Twitter you know that's my curated truth people you know so I follow this person and that person that person you know whatever Joel Rogan says and whatever you know Ben Shapiro says you know that's my truth now come on this is my truth sanctify Thy word is truth amen it ain't no celebrity or some Superstar or some football somebody that I follow Thy word is true that's where your Anchor's got to be my goodness in the world that we live in in the Old Testament it said Deuteronomy 324 said he is my rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of Truth amen he's my rock that's that's a that's a a rock is something that's sure and reliable a rock is is security and stable it's my rock it's my continuance it's my it's my shity it's my reliability it's my rock God Is My Rock Amen but I can tell you in this word in this world if truth is firm and stable and and faithful the status of this world completely I would say shows lack of completely of all truth okay we'll just def find that there Paul pilate in John 18 very familiar area of script scripture I apologize I don't even know what time I started maybe like some time ago we'll just try and get all through here brother brother Wayne see your pastor said we have one service today I said yeah we're one service back home too and it's just church we just have church and we sing and we worship and we praise and we hear the word of God and that's what the day is for and then we go home to lunch's dinner maybe I'm just kidding I know everybody especially the moms with little babies like whoa where's this preacher going amen but I'll just blame you cuz if you pull I'm preaching it's your fault not mine your fault amen well we're in this together amen John 18:37 pilate therefore said unto him art thou the king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king he said to this end I was born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth amen so here Jesus is saying I have been sent into the world to Bear witness of the truth everyone that is of Truth heareth my voice think about this now here pilate as we even said to young people last night Rich Young Ruler had an opportunity to stand before Christ here now pilate had his moment to stand before the Living God in flesh and now he's saying I've been I've been sent here to to to Bear witness to truth and everyone that's of Truth hears my voice and pil says what is truth to me to me that whole that whole event as pilot is I know wrestling in his mind I can't see no fault in this man what what am I supposed to do with this and here truth is standing in front of him as we will get to in in a little bit but here he's standing and he's saying I've been come to Bear witness of Truth and those that that are of Truth are going to hear my voice and clearly pilate was not of truth because his response to that was what is truth right amen and the very next part of scripture says he went out again and I thought here Jesus is standing all beaten and bruised and such there standing before Pilate and he responds to his question and pilot looks at him and says what is truth and walks outow you are staring at your heart obviously yearing for something you you you were you were Desiring something he was tormented but he did he was not of Truth to hear truth and I would say 2,000 years since that moment of time the world breathes pilot cynicism and also says the same thing what is truth amen how many people these days they don't have a clue what truth is and they're they're they're wanting it in some way but pilot well what is truth and just walk away there's an old song I won't even say who wrote it or who even sang it some here might even well maybe would recognize it if you're in your earlier days but there was a song that was said the young man speaking in the city squares trying to tell somebody that he cares yeah the ones that they're calling wild are going to be leaders in a little while this old world's walk into a newborn day and I Sly Say it'll be their way you better help The Voice of Youth find what is truth think about this is this is a worldly song back in several decades and they're screaming out there you better help the youth find what is truth because they're your leaders of the Next Generation they're the ones that are going to be calling the shots and if they don't know truth where's this world going I'd say the cry hasn't diminished the den and the sound of war against truth has increased and Satan is trying to obstruct and to hide and to attempt the defeat of Truth and his Triumph amen that's where we're at right now and so truth as I would say in my title truth is going to march on truth is going to march on so here a truth in John 14 and if I go and prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life I would present this morning if you're unsure or if you are wondering and I would I would say everybody here isn't isn't but if you're ever if you're wondering where is truth I'm going to tell you this morning in very clear aspect in very clear English Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen Jesus is trth and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so if I could say as we go through scripture sanctify them through Thy word Thy word is truth that means the word of God is truth and if Jesus Christ is the embodied word made flesh that means this word and all that it says is truth amen this is this is the absolute being born again not a corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever and cannot be broken amen Jesus answered and said is not it written in your law that ye are Gods if ye called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken it's pure and unchangeable so the word of God which was Jesus Christ who was in flesh the word made flesh in that day is now embodied in this Bible right here and he said I am the tray the truth and the life that means this gospel right here of Incorruptible seed is the truth that's going to hold you keep you preserve you fortify you when you have a question or don't know what to say go back to the truth this is your absolute I don't need no some philosophical definition of truth I didn't need to go to some Theologian to tell me what truth is or what's right or what's wrong I just need to go to the very word of God where Jesus Christ himself said I am the way I am the truth and I have been made I'm the word made flesh so this word and me are one so if you're looking for an answer it's right there someone says truth is wow that's the real facts about something or it's in accordance with reality or reality is the true situation that exists I don't really care what they think it is my word tells me that this is true and that's where my anchor holds I tell you everything in this world is meant to deceive and set you on a destabilized path put you in a state I would say of mistrust well is that quite the right way or is it really the way maybe it's not quite the way that you know to to be seen and and it's trying to steer you and lead you or places will get to in a in a mislead you out of truth's way that's Satan's way but if I go first and we'll just go this way before we go back that way the scripture says in Ephesians 6 that armor where take unto you the whole armor of God that's right amen Paul I don't believe Paul is uh was just kind of willy-nilly in writing well I'll maybe just put this word here or maybe I'll just write it this way no he was inspired and anointed by the Holy Spirit to write specific words amen specific word that's why I don't go all these the the the message translation and this translation all these different things I'm going to go with a Bible that Prophet preached out him and CU I want the full impact of the word not some watered down religion of some well this in some new age vernacular forget it I don't want new age vernacular I want a prophet's vernacular and if he went to this version I'm going to send with it so my King James Bible says wherefore take you unto you the whole armor of God don't pick and choose and say well I'm going to leave my shield behind no the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand amen and if you didn't get that he went to verse 24 and said stand therefore so it's a double stand amen having your loins number one Girt about with truth this is actually before everything before all your armor before every aspect that that he's telling you to G yourself up with and and to put on and put your helmet on you say well my shield my sword is very important all that in in in in battle but the first aspect that he puts in there is to G yourself with truth this is before any other protection of Weaponry of Defense of offense it's first and I again I don't feel Paul was so he was not careless there's a reason why truth was first it's because truth and it's not a fashion statement it's because it's a major support okay when you're tacking on Armor and probably nobody here has tacked on medieval armor except a few people last night I saw a couple I saw a couple did anybody was your belt first you know that's a process to get girded up for war you know there there's there's a process there but the belt of truth that you would GT about your loins it's because it's a major support everything buckles to it you know if you didn't actually have that belt that g about you and you just had your breastplate and and all your sword well I don't even know where your sword would go and all these different things it just be clanging and clacking all around and you'd be in the battlefield like the Tin Man just clankity clankity clankity not even knowing how to function like well I can't even get my sword I not even there because I left it at home because I had nothing to G it to so truth was number one it was the core area it's it's what everything buckles to and it's it's if if you don't have a core belief if you don't have the the core structure if you don't have truth well then you are going to compromise you are going to just yield to this and yield to that oh what culture says here well social culture says this now so I need to say this I can't say that word over here I got to say this now because they tell me this no they don't tell me nothing that tells me what to do that tells me what to say that tells me what to act that tells me what to believe I don't need no social culture my core area my core belief my core support is the very word of God right you say well that's pretty pretty Elementary well I'll tell you there's a whole lot of several billion people that it's not Elementary too because they are they're they are the ones clacking around in fact they don't have no armor let alone the belt of Truth and so in this core area it's your lumbar support anybody ever had lumbar problems it's brutal it's because it's your it's your core support when you when your lumbar area goes it's just like everything is now affected and when truth is not present that's right in the lumbar regions of your spiritual walk every is affected how you talk is affected how you respond is affected how you act is affected how you speak what you do how everything is affected young people and old people alike and so that Lumber area is critical and so you do core exercises amen right you get your muscles all working you know in the pelvis the lower back the hip the ab abdomen they all got to work in order and harmony for you to be able to function you know it leads to better balance who doesn't want that leads to stability I know I'm talking natural sense but just take the spiritual connotations and parallels here with truth and a strong core that's GT about your loins you're going to walk stable neither to the left or to the right nothing's going to sway you someone's at school's going to ask you hey why don't you do a little this hey come on with us with us and do this or maybe some text comes through and you're like who is that I'm not responding to that hey join us on this at this party no no no you're walking stable your support is strong you're anchored in the word of God Amen that's right you know a good core it supports better balance better posture you stand up straight shoulders back it protects even your organs that's right it can reduce and prevent pain it actually helps us grow old well strong lumbar we all need that without core truth amen you think as you get older without truth the longer you go the more decrepit right hunched and weak you become that's right spiritually speaking nobody wants to be barely able to take a step spiritually amen look ahead right our core and these loin now as scripture says G your loins it's a part of your being truth protects this area and we're naturally if you if you the loins area it's your protective area of your body and it's not if you just want to think about the I know the reproductive aspect but we create things in many ways we create things by our words right we create you know humans we can build and we do different things and people are art artists and all that kind of thing we create but we also create atmosphere amen scripture says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use and edifying that it may minister Grace unto the hearers and so by our words by even our presence it creates an atmosphere and if our if our if our a COR our loins are not GED our spiritual loins with truth What atmosphere are we creating what words are we speaking and creating an atmosphere that's not conducive to the Holy Spirit or our relationships we create relationships with one another and without truth what kind of relationship are you creating young man or young woman that's looking to enter into a relationship or interested in each other if truth is not your I'd say don't even step into a relationship it's got to be your foundation it's got to be your support as you walk into a relationship you're creating something right that's right nothing but truth everything we do scripture is showing it must be supported with truth you got to take this word yes sir you need to yourself [Music] right and Satan hates it oh he hates it he's fought against it he's got his best weapon we know it goes back to the very beginning we know his his reasoning and doubt be reason being is because truth is what defeats him right truth is what defeats him and so he's so angered and anx against the word of God God because it's your anchor he's the Healer of all your disease and if you can just anchor your faith on a scripture in there Lord you bore stripes for me you bore it for my iniquity and my infirmity You're My Healer you're my provider that Abra as Abraham received a ram out you created it there if you could anchor on that you are a fortress against the enemy and so he fights you if the scripture all things are possible to them that believe amen why why why do you think he's so heavy on just causing just that inkling of Doubt because if you could take hold of that scripture then indeed all things what's your problem this morning what's your need this morning you say well it's almost an impossible need brother Mike well that's okay because my Bible says all things can you define all for me it's like complete it's entirety it's everything it's all encompassing there's nothing left out it's not it's not 99.999 it's all things that means your problem your situation your difficulty your sickness I don't really care what it is but all things are answered by the very word of God which is the truth which is why Satan fights you yes Lord amen I love this quote but BR says Jesus said my sheep know my voice a voice of course is his word when he is speaking my sheep know my voice and my voice has been proven to them to be true it's been Vindicated that it is my voice and I thought about that my sheep know my voice and there Jesus was walking through the G the the land of Galilee and all through the different cities of capernum and such and these different areas and he would be walking through and he'd be saying certain things and he'd be start to speak the scripture and he'd say I am the way the truth and the life and he' start to speak the words to them but he didn't just say words then they would come up to and the lame would come and the Halt and the blind he said I would that you be healed the lady that had seven demons the lady that came to wash his feet he says stand up and be whole thy sins be forgiven the blind saw the deaf heard the mute spoke the lame walked the demon possessed were delivered his voice of what he said was then Vindicated in action proving that he is indeed the way the truth the life I want you to hold on to that no more but BR says no more than an eagle last night as he spoke him on that could understand the clucking H his voice rang out I'm a Healer and he healed his voice rang out that he's a deliverer amen isn't that what the scripture says that he quoted Isaiah he he says I've come amen this day the scripture is fulfilled there it was to heal the brokenhearted to free the bound to bring those that are captive to Liberty and he spoke it and said this day the scripture is fulfilled fulfilled and then he walked out what did he do he freed the captive he made at Liberty those that were bound he delivered those that were in need he Vindicated what he said he was that is so important Saints brother bit would say What's the difference between the denominations and what you believe he said it's the Vindication that's such a vital aspect it's a Vindicated word a lot of people can say a lot of things but does God come behind it and activate and vindicate what he said and then what he said is my sheep hear my voice because something inside that Little Hen couldn't hear anything they saw they looked they heard they noticed but nothing inside them but he said only my people only my sheep actually have truth inside of them so they'll hear truth when it's spoken so that's why only someone like Peter or John or Andrew would walk along the way and he would call them and say Nathaniel in whom it is no gu I saw you there you were under the tree how did you see me and something started to rise up within him and said Thou Art the Christ you're the Messiah why because he wasn't a little can or little little chicken it was an eagle that was that he was born of a different seed of a different race amen and so something rang in his soul realm when he heard the scream something pilate never heard right discernment Charles Spurgeon said discernment is not knowing the difference between right and wrong it's knowing the difference between right and almost right amen that's good right we're not really worried about right and wrong it's the almost right Ary the problem because that's how the devil is just wanting to to to figure it out as the other old quote goes close only works in Horseshoes and Hand Grenades it's good to be close there but everywhere else it's not so good you got to be dead on Amen and so here we go at the very beginning the very beginning strategy of the enemy as the as as the battle now for truth would have started Genesis 3:1 says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field of which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden I want you to realize this is the first question ever recorded in scripture and it's presented now the very first dilemma in scripture never had there been a question in scripture hath God said so I would say the moment that Devil comes to present a question go right back and say I know exactly where you're at there I'm just going to point you back to the beginning because you haven't obviously changed your tactic and here in chapter 3 you did that so immediately you should have every bit of armor it's already buckled strong and it's right up and ready for the offense all right because here ha God said and he's now he's just created how it's been recorded he said he he goes it's phrased in a way to create something it's phrased in a way to create doubt is what it is it's how he's done it and now for the first time this this deadly damic force has come into the world covertly smuggled into human life now it's this assumption that what God has said is subject now to human judgment have he said so now he's taken what God Said and he's like now now but I have I have my own idea about this think about this and he's now trying to introduce the thought to Eve in her mind that there's actually something wrong with forbidding the fruit it's kind of like did God really tell you that is that really what he was meaning is that really what this message means amen amen Satan very subtle now asking Eve you make a judgment call Eve I'm putting you this to you now you make a call is this really what God was saying did God really tell you not to eat from any tree in the garden did he really say that why would God even put this restriction on you why would God do that why would he be so narrow amen why would he even limit you this way why would does God really want you to be free isn't God you know for free will isn't he pro-choice isn't he for Freedom doesn't God want you to do whatever you want to do come on It come on whatever looks good whatever feels good whatever brings you to pleasure whatever brings you Joy whatever brings you satisfaction whatever brings you Freedom why is God limiting you this way isn't that effectively what he was saying to her right right and notice in that question Satan asked he said from every tree of the garden as if the prohibition was of the whole place it was one tree that's right but the way Satan's formed it it's like no everything here you why is he so limit he's so narrow-minded and the suggestion that really god tampers with your freedom God restricts you Eve God is very narrow he takes away your right I'm just taking out of that scripture there hath God said you know you got to read between the lines God's un is even unkind taking away the pleasures could you really be able to trust him now this is a perfect world Eve why would you ever do that this is really unnecessary and Satan plants the thoughts now in her mind right that God is this way he's restraining and he's limiting he's unkind and really not fully good and now he's devoted but he now the serpent he's devoted to her Freedom here he's presenting an option now I'm really I care for you H so much more I'm gonna present you a better option Eve I care more than God cares her choice for happiness really cares more than God does and maybe even saying with a little bit of incredulity I can't believe that God even told you you couldn't even eat of that tree why would he ever do that and plants now this seed in her mind that God is flawed in his character and his goodness is suspicious wow and now when Eve swallowed this she swallowed her right and ability now and she's now said now I actually can question God's word she swallowed this now and so once she swallowed that yeah now then Satan steps in with the next part which is step two and follows up now with the lie he's not going to present the LIE very first he's going to step in first and just say really is this where God's at is this really the right way and once you question and doubt that and question the truth then he presents the lie that you're going to be ready to swallow that's his tactic not saying you have I'm just saying this is his tactic amen and so now here Eve he says now for you shall not surely die I mean we're not we're not even talking right and almost right here we're talking right in total contrary to what God has just spoken ye shall not surely die but because he prepped her he prepped her he got her in a place to reason and question the very word of God and that's exactly where he wants you young people and everybody here he wants you just to step in and just I don't care what scripture I don't care what one word out of the thousands in here if he can get you to a place just to doubt one word of God then he presents the lie and says well you're not going to die I know he said that but it's wrong I I know he said in Malachi 4 that he's going to send a prophet like Elijah at the end time before the great and judgeful day of the Lord but it's wrong I know he said Revelation 10:7 says that there's going to be an angel is going to come to seven Angel is going to come and reveal all the mysteries of God but it's wrong that's not the one but you know it vindicate no no it's it's wrong and you've already stepped into believe and to listen to him I say don't even let him get to square one don't even let him get you to the place where you're like well I don't no don't get to the while I don't just say you're wrong you're an offense to me devil I'm going to stand on God's word I'm going to believe it with all my heart regardless of what you [Applause] say don't give him a toenail hold right so he says you not surely die and if we can say Satan effectively says well Eve God's a liar and I tell you the truth now don't believe a word of it believe me God doesn't tell the truth there's no judgment there's no consequences if you eat it you can't trust God no more to tell you the truth you can't even believe his word anymore it's needlessly narrow needlessly confining and restraining I am now the absolute think about that you say well that was just Eve no I'd say that's everybody in this day and age the same Slicker the same devil the same one that just entered into that Garden so subtly just weaving his little way along in his life and his way to start to question it's in the same you say well it's not really here you bet it is it's in the the very ranks of this message that is causing cuz he's trying to get you to be deceived because it'll be so close that it'll deceive even the very El if it were possible you don't tell me that the Slicker is not coming in and trying to present just the most smallest subtle bit of Doubt oh saints of God we got to be so watchful so careful that we just be be don't even let anybody come in and try to tamper with the word of God I'm not saying with your idea I'm saying with the word of God you take it back to hear and you take it back to a Vindicated message I don't care what somebody else said I want to see their Vindication I want to see the angel of God back up behind them before they tell me what they think I tell you everybody post post the messenger has a lot of things to say you can't tell me that there wasn't even more during The Messengers day you don't think they were trying to trap him trying to get him to go into a corner trying to find some area in his life that they could put a finger hold on and say aha look at that and you think now is hard right then and they couldn't find it they couldn't find one thing false in all the Vindication in all the discernment not one time I don't care to sense about this day and age what someone says hallelujah hallu sir L Brown says Eve was easily persuaded by Satan from the word of God and she leaned on her own understanding he said she had something something else had told her by the enemy Satan and she believed it and it plunged the whole human race to death he said now it ended finally death to the whole race he said the word of God Satan speaking now but brandom speaking on his behalf he's saying that the word of God is Not altogether true that some of it is inspired and some of it is not heard that before well let's just nail that's coffin closed how can you have faith in a Bible If part of it is inspired and part of it is not if one if one quotation is wrong the whole thing then might be wrong it's got to be all right exactly right and if I can say what you've probably heard a 100 thousand times God will never vindicate an [Applause] error so then if he vindicates truth my word is truth it's all truth and nothing but the truth so help me God to quote your judges and this tactic really is held through all time Satan has used it over over and over again to where really truth has become relative there's no absolute to truth because now he's he throws that one on everybody so then everybody questions it and everybody's got their own human brain and so you've def deciphered it some way and so now you've got your own truth and so everybody has their own truth you know it's relative your truth's relative to someone else's truth and you so you say well you say what's that mean exactly well being relative to something means if I if I made $10 an hour and someone's going to drop me $50,000 I say whoa that's a that's a chunk of cash and it'd be amazing and it'd be incredible but if I made $50 million and someone was going to drop me $50,000 I'd be like no thanks but I got a lot more it's relative right it's relative to my position and everybody's truth becomes relative to someone else's position on how they think about something right that's this is how it is nowadays well you believe what's true for you and I'll believe what's true for me and know we're all just get together you know you can tolerate this and I'll tolerate that and it's all good you know truth it's subjective to my culture it's it's you know this is what we do and and this is my truth and you have your culture and that's your truth maybe truth is in the eye of the beholder maybe Different Strokes for different folks you know you have your beliefs and I I have mine maybe trust your feelings you know CU that's my truth I'm going to I'm going to trust that or my education you know my experience that's my truth I have an high IQ I have a high EQ you know and that's where I'm going to leave things everybody's got their own truth it is what it is it's where we're living Saints and so you got to be able to go to back to something young people you living in the most wicked time 10 times worse than where I was and 100 times worse than where your your parents were Etc and you have to be able to go back to an absolute and say my goodness culture is telling me to do this my friends are telling me to do that and social media is telling me to do this celebrities are telling me to do that pressure here pressure there you've got to be able to go back to a truth the truth the absolute truth you must feelings betray you my goodness you're up today or down tomorrow you know I had it in my notes somewhere you know if I went on my feelings on truth if I could put it in a bit of an analogy let's uh let's hook you up to your feelings on a long bungee cord and your feelings are the anchor and jump let me tell how how well you're going to last in that situation cuz today it's good and tomorrow it's bad and my feelings are this way and then my feelings are that way so today I'm going to Anchor my my bungee jump on my feelings today but somehow you're like where was I when I was thinking that and you jumped off on something and dying on it because you jumped on your feelings cuz today now it's changed you're like well that just meant nothing yeah but you made a decision over there on those feelings because that was your truth and you just jumped off the edge and you crashed and [Applause] burned yes L Brandon says but you're afraid you go how you feel because you've regarded that you live by your feelings your whole life has been wrapped in that but you must get away from that and act on God's word not what you feel not what you see but what God God said amen but what God Said is my absolute truth that's when no matter what situation I go through when it looks like my whole life is Caven and my family looks like it's breaking apart and I got sickness in my home and I got a disease causing issue with my children and I can anchor my tie poost to the very Rock of Ages left for me and say you bore stripes for this situation you hang on across for my situation and I'm going to Anchor my little Lifeline to that and guess where I'm going right off the edge because I know that will hold me [Music] you say well that's into the unknown that's okay because I know the chord that's what it's anchored to I know what it's anchored to and I know he'll never let me go his strong arm can reach far far down into the depths of sin Saint and he can reach down his hand for you in the muck and the mire because that's the anchor [Applause] post that's what job did job got to that spot that's right finally he began but brand says then finally he begin to feel the strain tightening up oh my can you imagine the feeling of that all he'd gone through I tell you he was Free Falling for a long time anybody here bungee jumped all right I'm all alone in this am I I have bungee jumped so I'm going to speak from experience and you leap off the edge boy is that a feeling and I can tell you that pales in comparison of when you have some situation you're like Lord I have no idea of where this is taking me and you jump off that the edge and suddenly everything of course you go weightless your stomach goes a little crazy and you're just now in the void and you're looking at the ground coming closer and maybe just maybe in your mind for some of you it flashes oh boy I think this thing's going to I hope it's going to hold yeah you're just and then then you have other problems because the ground's coming coming closer things are flying so fast and then you feel the strain tighten up and that moment when you realize that yes it's holding is a really good feeling when job well felt the strain tighten up I know in whom I have believed and am persuaded I know my redeemer liveth and I will see him on that day though my flesh would go to the worms in the dust I'm going to see him the strain tightened up it didn't matter what happened Oh my he was anchored well I'm just going to do me you do you you do me do me what works for me is best you know if you take the path of least resistance humanity is always going to go the easy way always that's just how man is built and so if you're going to go your way it always always be the path of least resistance and I can tell you this is a rugged way it's a very resistive way you've got a battle in this way and so if you're going your way you're going to go the least resistant way I tell you it's the wrong way that's right well all religions brother Michael have truth all paths lead to Heaven no oh okay know Christian is so limiting uh-huh but Bram says I believe we're living in the last day this last message if everything was truth it actually would defeat the whole meaning of truth that's right cuz if all was true well then that doesn't even the word doesn't mean truth because there has to be a false for there to be truth so if you say all paths lead to to heaven and everything is true well then what's the needful of the word true why would there even be a word that way because all of it's true no something has to be wrong for there to be true so that means not you got to find what's the absolute truth like I said discern between right and almost right brother brandham says that's why I'm here tonight trying my best to call every side of the world and all that I can do to let the people see that he is the true and living God he's the only door the only religion out of thousands of religion Christian religion is the only one that can prove their founder is still alive Hallelujah that's where young people you can stand on the ground and say m you can tell me all you want but I know that I serve a living God and we're going to get there because you might need this when you stand toe to- Toe with the devil in the coming days and you say well how can I tell them that my God is alive today amen all right I'm going to give you some ammunition amen I'm going to put some bullets in your big shot gun we're going to put a big old slug in there okay big 12 gauge Slugger you ready he says nothing to be ashamed of in Christianity if it isn't the truth then I'm through with it if it isn't the truth I want the it's the biggest err in the world world ever had but if it's the truth I'm willing to die for it amen you got to be willing to die for this truth die for this gospel and so then brother brandom as we continue through it comes down then you have some what you would call Showdown moments when it you come to the moment where all right I'm willing to die here this is the mountain I'm willing to die on some things you go through life you're like yep it's not the mountain I'm willing to die on it's going to walk away from that one it's just not worth the argument it's not worth but there are mountains that are willing to die on and I will tell you defending and offending for the gospel truth is a mountain willing to die on right and so we come to these moments if we go back in scripture mankind came to a place where they had raised up their ideas God had to make a a special move and so remember the beginning the cility and how Eve brought in that question and so truth and certain things have been lost faith had been lost and now God in scripture had a big battle on you know there's in in a war you have lots of battles and some battles are bigger than others and here now we're going to go into a little area where God had to come in and now fight a battle and God was revealing to himself in Israel as we heard this morning song He's The God Who fights for me Lord of every Victory Hallelujah man as he brought them out of Egypt showed himself Mighty with through deliverance and all through the different plagues and then there was a mingling they got out of that and they went through a period of time and they started to mingle started to to to to interconnect with different religions you could say the the almost right religions as they were and then not the not so right and then the very wrong they started to accept other gods as okay and true right think about this say wow how do we get to this point well if you look in the script scripture Israel went from a God that delivered them with a strong hand brought them out of Egypt decimated the the whole uh the whole uh Egypt's territory and their whole economy and Etc it brought them out of it it killed the firstborn of everything and here that this is our God and then not too long down the road it's like well you know Bale's good and asaroth is good and we're just D true incredible huh time drifted so did they resolve for truth and judges came and it say in judges it was in the days and there was no King and every man did that which was right in his own eyes his own truth and I'd say maybe that's about the time people are in here right now and they deem that it's okay to deviate from other worship we can worship another God and it was even very clear the Commandments even with the Commandments of Moses written and given directly from God it was you know they found it that there was there should have been some leeway for them to do their own thing God said in Exodus I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me they knew God was speaking they'd seen God vindicate himself amongst them and here God is directly telling them no other gods so you say how is this possible because the devil's a Slicker and so he says Thou shalt not make any Graven image any likeness of anything Thou shalt not bow thyself down nor serve them for that I am the Lord thy God and I am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children under the third and fourth generation but Israel unfortunately Contin went back and forth and felt this and then a judge would rise up and then they'd go back and another Jud judge would rise up and it came to a climax at the lowest of depths of Israel they heid taken and Ahab the son of omry did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing came to a place Israel came to a place where it was a light thing just casual who cares God doesn't care about this it's it's really not a big deal if I if I do this here I mean really what's the big deal everybody's doing it I mean come on why can't I watch a whole bunch of movies here and there and every why can't I do this it's not really a big deal it became a light thing to deviate for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam it was a light thing to do such and he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which had been built in Samaria and he did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel and to anger them than all the kings of Israel that were before him what a place they had come to and out of the blue but brand even says don't even know where he came from out of the blue Elijah the tishbite walks on to the scene amen that's right the age had got so dark it had got so wicked it had got so evil it took a prophet that God sent down and said I need you to step out in this age because I need you to come to a showdown to show that this word of mine is true so I'm going to send a prophet Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful story before The Showdown of Mount Caramel to show the world what's truth you know Baal was the god of fertility he was the one that bestowed fruit and bounty to the land he was also actually called the Lord of rain and Dew God's got to sense a humor yes does because their God the fertile God they say of rain and duw the one that could bring all sustenance you know the highly adaptable God he could be Zeus he could be Jupiter he morphed Through Time baales rooted in sensuality and ritualistic prostitution at times even human sacrifice usually the firstborn to one of the making a sacrifice and the now the Canaanites worship bail and he usually depicted holding a lightning bolt and he defeated enemies and he produced crops and God sends a prophet and says there'll be no rain for the next until I call for it amen I challenge your God that you say is true to a duel you say he's the Lord of Reign and du I'm going to send my messenger out there and I'm going to announce to you a declaration of war they'll be no rain until I call for it that's what was happening right there I don't even know how these how the the prophets of baale and all that kind of thing well we're getting get there and so Elijah came to all the people and he said how halt you because now we go through the story but he now brings him to Mount Caramel and he goes now how halt you up between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if ba follow him and the people answered not a word silence and it came down to this is true or this is true there's no in between false true or false true and you can't halt now between two opinions because halting is a state of uncertainty I just don't know I'm just uncertain about it there's just this little bit of Doubt just a hint of doubt you're now halting a little bit you're kind of in Eve's place you're like well it's that halting moment and between an opinion it's not capable of being proven either way so you've just kind of like well I don't know if I can prove it this way or prove it that way you're halting between two opinions and Elijah was coming down and saying you're why halt you between two opinions coming this day to not be an opinion what's true and what's false there's not going to be no room for opinion there's not going to be room for halting you're coming to a moment where you're going to have to say choose ye this day in whom you'll serve that's right God has come to that moment in this day and age it's a choosy this day moment I'm sorry but there is no room for opinion they'd seen God move back and forth and and many times before that and I'd say Israel now had even rendered their beliefs to just opinion and so now Elijah came up to the people and he said I only remain a prophet of the Lord and but the baale prophets are 450 men and here they come and he goes go get two Bullocks and one bulock for themselves and cut them into pieces and he goes through all the different things and here's what we're going to do and so he laid out the whole plan and then the people said it's well spoken so now they agreed we're okay with this duel we're okay with the terms so now it's on their hands right now it's you God laid it out he said all right took the Bullock dressed it put it on the Altar and it came to pass here at noon the prophets of Baal had taken their all their different things and there they called on the name of Baal this is the the Lord of rain and duw that should come down and and bring fire into the Altar and consume the sacrifice because of course he's God and he can do these things and bail hear us and there was no voice nothing that even answered and they leaped on the altar think about this scene here they have the altar at 450 prophets are are dancing all around this thing and jumping up on down on the Altar and they're calling and yelling and screaming then they're cutting themselves and this is this is a scene a foolish scene and Israel is sitting down there being like wow what's happened wow and even Elijah steps in and says hey the scripture says he mocked them right hey cry aloud he's he's your god let's go let you know say something a little louder maybe you're too quiet and it went from probably 100 DB to 150 DB through the through the audience or maybe maybe he's talking to somebody or maybe he's pursuing something or maybe he's on a journey and he's ignoring you you mean your God doesn't care for for you isn't he caring about where you're at like this is a showdown moment maybe he's out on vacation somewhere maybe per Adventure he's sleeping oh my goodness talk about an insult to injury right they cried aloud and they cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till Blood gushed Out upon them and they worshiped loud and boisterous with emotion and shouting oh my goodness our God is here no he's not right amen because it's the God who answers by fire amen he said all right it's my turn stop your yelling stop your shouting stop your screaming just sit down amen and a little Prophet walks on the scene and the first thing he does he begins begins to repair the altar yes sir that's right Stone amen by Stone that's right the first thing you need to do is repair the altar that's right maybe something's out of place he starts to rebuild that's right put things back in order that's right number one amen because he wanted God to come on the scene and he had to take care of business first you want God to come and scene in your life you want God to move in your life you need to take care of business first you to repair the altar of your heart you say Lord I need to get this out of here I want this out of here I've been following this here I've been listening to this here I want a full surrender I need to wipe it all out just place your finger in every air of my heart I'm going to open up every doorway I want to rebuild the altar cuz I want fire so there he repairs The Altar and cleans it all up and he takes the 12 Stones according to the tribes of Israel builds the altar with stones puts the wood in order he gets them together kills the bulock and he lays it now on top of the altar but Abraham says now to be sure there there's no faking this go get me 12 barrels of water yeah and he soaked the wood water soaked he said oh Hallelujah he wanted to show that God was God because why he had thus saith the Lord right he was pouring on The Impossible on top of the impossible and he said I want to make sure that you're going to see in front of the world that my God is God this was not something that was in the back corner something that was hid behind the curtain say well yeah he did it back there but I know but I didn't see it no this was in front of them and to just put it down into it then bring the water I know but Fire and Water they just don't mix I know bring a bring a barrel bring another Barrel bring another barrel and he poured the water on it and said this is impossible I know it is but it's my God I have thus sath the Lord hallelujah there the water ran all down and it came to pass at the time of the offer offing the evening sacrifice he said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art the god in Israel that I am thy servant and I have done all these things of Thy word hear me oh Lord that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and thou Hast turned their heart back again amen ever heard that scripture before yes sir amen Elijah and the spirit of Elijah are going to be saying the same thing they're going to be acting the same way they're going to be doing the same thing because the types cannot lie God cannot change and so he says so that thou has turned their heart back again and the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the birt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was even in the trench the allc consuming fire of God came and Vindicated himself to prove to Israel I am God you say well brother Michael the people fell on their faces and I was just thinking as a little humble man came before a Pulpit at a challenge at a debate right and he stood before a little pulpit and if I could put it let's just go back to those days and the god that answers by fire amen right and before you the god of fire dropped in on the scene and hovered above that little Prophet there and man's image took a shot and there it sits in your Library of Congress protected by your government so no devil can even get in there and trying to tear it apart and cause it it's locked by your government it's the truth God answered by Pillar of Fire in this day as he did in Elijah's day to prove to you and to me this gospel is a Vindicated truth show me another God show me another bail that can do that there is no other God that picture that's not just a picture that's this day Showdown that's Mount Carmel right there young people don't you just look casually and say oh that's just a picture of the pillar of fire that's your God coming again showing himself alive today this word my word is [Applause] [Music] true so then when Elijah came out and said something that didn't quite maybe understand they're like I don't know but God Vindicated him I don't quite understand that but God Vindicated him Lord show it to me reveal it to me but I believe it Lord you Vindicated him right and then he went on the attack and said go and kill every priest of Baal that's good exactly and you don't think that Elijah and those that are anointed with the eagle anointing of this day are commanded go and kill every demon of this age that combats the very God of this day that's your commission it's a battle for truth don't just stand there he said go kill all of them I don't care if it's a demon of Oppression I don't care if it's a demon of depression I don't care if it's a demon of pornography I don't care if it's a demon of movies I don't care if it's a demon of music I don't care if it's demon whatever it is kill it you've been given the word of this hour to kill it he didn't just arm you with nothing he didn't say go get it and you got nothing on you you got the sword of the word turn it about with truth you have the confidence to know my word is trueu and thus the battle was won and he's here to set you free right because because he said and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free there's no need to have anybody in a congregation allowing the Devil to put a little foothold in your life or to pull the wool over anybody's eyes and even to think that well I am free but you know really actually deep down there's something he sent you a word so that you would be totally free no complex no fear no sickness truth strips Satan from death and Hell truth sent a word to this day to give you a promise to this that this body will be changed truth sent a word that created an expectation amen of what's to come maybe as we close let's just bring it up to date Butter Brown says you just go along with me but Braham says here's a showdown so he said well Michael that was good that's was in first Kings and chapter 18 but you know what about today okay what about the Elijah today verbatim here is a showdown do you believe I've told you the truth amen amen amen you just did what the congregation did do you believe you have spiritual discernment to know what that did it's the truth he says we don't have to come up here he says I'm not a Healer I'm a man I'm your brother Christ is your healer amen is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so brother brandham is not your healer amen he says I'm a man am Christ is your healer amen if you can just recognize him to be here if you can just recognize him young people to be here right he says he's standing right here if he was standing right here with this suit on he couldn't heal you he's already done it he could only prove that he was Christ he says now what did he do when he was there he proved him that he was Messiah he showed Peter John Peter and Nathaniel all them by telling them who they were where they come from and what his signed to the Jews that was his closing of their age he said now there's another class of people that was Samaritans and he goes through that with a woman at the well he says now it did not go to the Gentiles did he for the Gentiles wasn't looking for him but I wrote there on the side of my notes but now is our time that wasn't our time then but now is the time of the Gentiles he says do you believe he's here would you discern it I'd say this morning do you believe he's here would you discern it amen he says I want to turn my back to the audience and I'll pray the Holy Ghost will prove what I've said tonight the closing of this message that the same signs that Jesus said was give to Sodom will be given to this generation then you discern what spirit is here you decide who God is God is God it's your choice now it's in your hands now is this true or is this false don't halt between two opinions I'm going to turn my back as he did as his back was to a tent there in Abraham's day and Sarah was in a tent I'm going to turn my back and I'm going to prove to you that this is truth there now with his back turned he said lady sitting over there the white thing on he says you have got a prayer card you sick are we strangers she didn't have a prayer card he says no God knows us both he says there's a light over the woman if you can see it circling right above her she was praying is that right no you have not got a chance see to come up here he goes you have not got a chance to come up but you are praying because I see just below that is is a dark shadow right here is now he's the angel of the pillar of fire now right hovering above this little lady and a prophet is standing with his back to her and he's saying there's a light above you and underneath that is a demon a dark shadow he said it's death that woman is shadowed with death she has cancer you believe God can heal you and I was just thinking how there is a demon Of Darkness but above that was the light and light can Darkness cannot overcome light there's she was under the influence and the presence of almighty God and there he was just waiting to confirm I am that same God that was there with Elijah I'm the same fire that consumed the sacrifice and death I don't care do you fear cancer it don't matter what the demon but my light is above it and I am going to conquer the darkness that is below me I'm going to put my foot on the enemy amen because that same light is here this morning that's living in you and living in me so place your foot on the enemy and say that's my God what's your need this morning if he was there in this day if God was here in this day is he here in this room this morning I'd say yes he is he said it's cancer of the breast I see a doctor looking at it and he tells you that it's going to try and operate he goes through all the details he said stand on your feet I wrote in my notes acknowledge that that was the god of Elijah acknowledge that's Jesus Christ from the scripture stand on your feet and prove to the world that what I said is true Time After Time After Time acknowledge stand on your feet acknowledge stand on your feet why did he do that so that you and I could have such trust in this gospel because I've placed my soul in it I've placed my whole life saying oh God I want to spend eternity with you I need to Anchor my soul somewhere I need to tie it on he said that's okay brother Michael I'm going to send you a message that you can anchor to and the world is going to have to acknowledge that it's [Applause] true can you discern that it's the same Jesus that touched the woman that touched His Garment I see a lady in a vision she's praying she's a young woman says there she is with a something about a baby she has to have a baby no he said it's a miscarriage it's what it's been he said it's a dead baby and she's from Kentucky and her name is Martin where are you Mrs Martin yes yellow dress that's true is it lady stand on your feet and say it so he said why did he have them standing their feet because what I just said so that everybody in this age could recognize that it was true and I just thought Lord you saw there as your presence was moving through the audience and your anointing was there and your you you were standing there with a prophet vindicating the word that you were coming behind to say this is where I'm identifying myself and God cared about a little lady who had an aching heart and any any sister here that's miscarried child and a daddy that's Stood Beside your wife that way the heart is broken and it's aching and there's so much turmoil in that moment but God the all caring one says I care you sister in the yellow dress you've just had a miscarriage God sees you he says look here there sits a little lady with a checkered looking dress she's got her head bowed now he says you're praying for a mother you got a prayer card you don't need one amen if I could have my Liberty and say you standing in brother bram's meetings you don't need to people put so much faith in a prayer card I need to get to the altar I need to get there before him says you don't need a prayer card he's here he can speak to you in your Pew say well I I wish I was there but Brandon's meetings I wish I was there right there when the anointing was there I say you don't need to because you said he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he is then he's here and he's doing the same things and can do the same things that he did there so then it's all actually on you and your faith and whether you can receive what he's saying to you this morning he says are you thinking you're praying for your mother are you thinking of bringing her to church tomorrow night he says you don't have to do it lay your hands on her and call on the name of Jesus and show it well if you'll believe it say well I got a wife at home that she needs to be healed I got a daughter at home or I got a son at home you go home you lay hands on her and scripture says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said I challenge your faith who else has not got a prayer card and wants to believe as a musicians come who else is not sitting in brother Brown's meeting and wants to believe who has a need that wants to say Lord I was not there but that God you're the same God that was with Elijah that was there was on Mount Carmel that a showdown of Truth what was right what was wrong you're that same God that proved that this gospel message is true and I want to say I believe it and I receive it and whatever my need is this morning I'm going to accept it in the name of Jesus Christ he said oh Lord God send your angel tonight give them the same discernment CU it's promise of your son he said oh a woman stands before me suffering in the head she's back in this Direction he says I feel her pulling Mrs Wy or Miss Wy he says where's you at go home and be well he says then everybody stand on your feet he says stand on your feet go home and be well he said that's the same
