Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; we thank you for this opportunity to come together for this [music] weekend's meetings. And Father, we believe the word is going to do what it [music] says it has done.

We want to have some church tonight. Amen. And I I just feel like something good is about to take place. Amen. I I I just feel like the blessings of God. [applause] Amen. [music] You know, uh, these these are these are ministers from the home church here. And Amen. And I got to praying about it last year and got to thinking. I thought, well, other people can have them for meetings. Why can't we? &gt;&gt; Uh so so we just asked the three brothers to to have a a meeting and and the Holy Spirit blessed it so wonderfully and Amen. It was a tremendous time. And you know, I I know it's it's just felt good all day. Uh just thinking about the meetings and what God's going to do. [music] And I'm just in such a good feeling coming to the house of the Lord tonight. And I didn't think it could get any better, Sister Barb. But uh Sister Barb Kovi stopped me on the way in tonight and she said, "Brother Wayne, I got some news." [music] I said, "What's that, Sister Barb?" She said, "Well, you know, all them tests they've been running on Brother Mike and uh you know, they they was pretty much pretty sure that he had Parkinsonism, different than Parkinson's disease, but Parkinson's ism." And all of you been praying, the Holy Spirit's been moving. [music] and she said they've done all the tests they could do on him and they've come back that it's not that that maybe he's he got some little something that's a physical problem that he can do some therapy and the Holy Spirit maybe some injury but folks it's went from a great big disease &gt;&gt; down to a little bit of nothing [music] [applause] I tell you what amen Amen. [applause] [music] Amen. [applause] [music] Isn't he mighty? Isn't he wonderful? [applause] Amen. Amen. Y'all know what that means. [applause and music] Y'all know what that means. We ain't sign for no blocks of rattlesnakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Spirit, God God is still real, folks. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you got if you're facing some great big battle tonight, don't you give up. &gt;&gt; Don't you just lay down and take whatever the devil serves you, you send it right back to him &gt;&gt; and you tell him, "I that don't [music] belong to me and I'm not going to sign for that cuz I don't have to." &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Jesus died for us that we might have freedom. Amen. And we have it here tonight as a free people. We're gathered here tonight believing God's going to do something wonderful in this place. I believe the Holy Spirit is still moving. &gt;&gt; You know, uh we've we've uh we call these meetings together and I'm just thinking today when you call a meeting, everybody comes in and wonders what's the meeting about. Well, I'll tell you, I I certainly believe that this [music] is the way that God deals with his children. I believe this is his program. This is God's power program. You you call a meeting, you come together, the musicians do their part, [music] the singers do their part, the ministry does their part, and God does his part, and you have a wonderful meeting. You know, Brother Bram says when a minister walks into [music] the congregation of praying people and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, he said, you're bound [music] to hear from heaven. &gt;&gt; How many come to hear from heaven tonight? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, Brother Wayne, I I uh we want to we want to hear from God." [music] And Brother Bram said, "The greatest and highest form there is for God to give a message to [music] his people is for the people to believe his word." That's the highest form is the preaching of the gospel &gt;&gt; is the highest form. [music] God didn't choose angels to preach it. &gt;&gt; He didn't preach mechanical [music] devices to preach it. But God chose men to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight we've we've asked a brother to come here that is [music] an agent of God that has prayed and asked. And brother Bram said when a man begins to be led of God, he said you become a messenger of God, God's angel. See, not an angel out of heaven, but an angel in the pullpit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I tell you tonight, if you just begin to pull on the Holy Spirit, I certainly believe that this is God's provided way to deal with your need. You got something in your heart tonight. You just begin to pull. I know the veil is brother Isaac, and he [music] might be personal to some of you, but there's a gift down in there. &gt;&gt; And that Holy Ghost that has come and and and dwelt behind that tabernacle. [music] When you begin to pull, the fire begins to speak and healings begin to happen. deliverances begin to take place. This is the way. This is God's way of feeding and speaking and dealing with his children. Amen. As we come together tonight, won't you stand to your feet as we ask the man of God to come to the platform. [music] Amen. I certainly believe that God has something wonderful in store tonight. Amen. For his mercy and truth. Amen. Brother Ben, if you would. Amen. As we invite the man of God tonight. Come and [singing] go with me to my father's house. Oh, to [music and singing] my father's house. Yeah. To my father's house. Won't you come and go with me? [music] To [singing] my father's house. Where there's peace, peace, [music] peace. Oh, [singing] come and go with me [music] to my father's [singing] house. To my [music] father's house. Oh, [singing] to my father's house. Come and go with [music and singing] me to my Oh, where [singing] there's [music] peace. Jesus will [singing] be. Oh, Jesus will be there in my in my father's room. [music] Oh, [singing] Jesus will be there in my father's [singing] house where there's peace. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you give him a hand clap of praise tonight? [applause] Amen. Amen. This is Father's house. [applause] Amen. So if the devil's here tonight, he's trespassing. Amen. Cuz this is Father's house. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've come to Father's house to worship and have a meeting where he's welcome amongst us. Amen. Is that your desire tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just to fellowship with him. And we just want to greet you all in the name of the Lord. It's good to be in the house of the Lord on a Friday night. And we're just thankful for the opportunity, thankful for our pastor and the meeting that he's set up and just allowed us to be a part. And uh he's been he's been preparing us for this meeting for a couple weeks now, telling us that to those that look for him, he shall appear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we've come to do this weekend is to look for Jesus. &gt;&gt; And if you come to look for a man, you'll be disappointed. But if you've come to look for him, he shall appear. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be with him and my buddies, Brother Nathan and Brother Ronnie. And they've been two of the most influential people in my life. And so I know the Lord's used them mightily for me. And I believe he's going to use them this weekend. &gt;&gt; And so we're just under expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll turn to the book of Matthew, chapter 16, and then 1 John 4. Thank you musicians for the music and the song specials. And it is good to see our brother Diego and &gt;&gt; brother Chris tonight and all the visitors. We just say God bless you. Matthew 16 starting in verse 13 says when Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am'? And they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. And he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the son of the living God? [snorts] And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven, and I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I'll build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. In 1 John 4 the first four verses it says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know you the spirit of God. Every spirit that confessth that Jesus Christ and come is come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of Antichrist, wherever you have heard that it should come, and even now already is it in the world. But ye are of God, little children, &gt;&gt; and have overcome them. &gt;&gt; Because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we bow our heads tonight for a word of prayer? &gt;&gt; If you have a need, just make it known unto the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, it's just so good to be in your house tonight, Father. Lord, and we believe that just a one word from you, Lord, will silence the voice of every spirit, Father. I pray, Lord, that the holy hush of your presence would just sweep through this building, Father, now, and silence every spirit. Lord, every nervous mother, Father, every Lord, worry about the weak and what's behind us or what's ahead of us, Father. Lord, may you settle over this building, Father, and wash away, Lord, every fear and every worry, Lord, and just step down into our midst. I pray, Father, that we might know that you're here and that you've dwelt among us, Lord. Lord, may we walk and talk with you for a moment. I pray father this weekend as we commit this into your hands in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats tonight. Amen. I'd like to if that's okay just for a few minutes just to take a thought out of those two texts on it is recognizing time. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is recognizing time and and for a bit of just a sub thought that's just real similar is the power of recognition. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I believe that's what we've gathered in this meeting to do. It's for one purpose. And brother Brandon would tell us. He said, "We're going to try to hurry up to get out. We're working for this one purpose for you to recognize the presence of Jesus Christ." If he is present, then everything is settled. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that he is here because he said, "Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be in the midst of them." &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want to recognize it. Amen. And I believe there's three things that I want to focus on that we want to recognize. And I believe that all three are taking place even now. It's the power of God and and Satan and then of yourself. And I believe all three of those things are gathered in this meeting. Amen. And but we want to recognize that. And we found that in First John, those three categories because it says, "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them, the devil, because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world." Amen. And so we three categories that have gathered. There's God, there's Satan, and there's you. And to recognize means to identify someone or something from previous encounters or knowledge or to acknowledge something's existence validity or legality that something is recognized or would be to perceive clearly or realize. So we find that recognizing has no impact on identity. Recognizing doesn't change anything. Recognize doesn't make something become something different. recognizing is is clearly and simply realizing what something already is. Like if you're driving down the road, Papa Vernon, and you see a light on the road and you say, "What is that light? Why is it moving like that?" And you say, you know, "Is it a car or is a is it a motorcycle?" And the closer you get, you realize what it is. Maybe it's a man with a flashlight. And you say, "Ah, I didn't know what it was until I seen it clearly and now I know what it is." A and and when we recognize it takes the confusion away because there you were confused. But when you recognize what something is, it takes the confusion away. Amen. That's why Satan, if he can just get you confused on your identity and say, "Why am I thinking these thoughts? Why am I going through these things? If I have the Holy Ghost, if I'm a son of God, why is this in my life?" life. If he can begin to bring confusion in your mind on your identity, then your world will turn upside down and you'll start to struggle in battle where if you just knew what you were, that would be a very small thing to you. But it's confusion that makes it a very large thing. Amen. Just like the disciples when they didn't recognize Jesus walking on the water, it brought confusion and fear saying, "Who is that? Is it a spirit?" But when they [snorts] recognized it, amen, they recognized that it was the son of God. And when they invited them into the boat, it settled the storms of their life. Amen. Amen. But we're living in a world of confusion. There's so much confusion. And brother Brandon told us that the reason there's confusion is not because that Jesus isn't here. It's because that he hasn't been allowed access to the places he's trying to go. Amen. He said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." But the church did not let him in. And so they chose instead to live in darkness and confusion instead of letting the man who could turn on the light into their midst. Amen. To take the confusion away. Oh, because Isaiah said, "Behold, darkness shall be upon the earth and gross darkness upon the people. Confusion of mind." Amen. Confusion of doctrine, confusion of everything, confusion of identity. Amen. In a dark in a dark and dismal day. Amen. Because Amos prophesied that there would be a famine in the land. And it wouldn't be a famine for water or bread, but a famine. Amen. To hear the true word of God. And people would go to and fro in a day of confusion seeking to hear the word of God. Oh, Brother Brham said, "What would you give in this day of confusion in exchange for the message of the hour?" Amen. What would you give in exchange for the truth? To know where you stand, to know who you are, to know where we're at. I say I wouldn't give anything in exchange in a day of confusion for a message of clarity and truth. &gt;&gt; Oh, confusion comes from lack of understanding. Brother Bram said, "The reason people don't understand the message and the scriptures are trying to bring to them is because they don't recognize the day that they're living in. That's why they don't understand, Amen, the scriptures that are being unveiled in this hour. And why does it matter? Because you just can't base faith in confusion. Brother Brandham taught us. And I'm sure we can all attest to that, that there's been times in your life where you were under confusion, and you can't base faith upon confusion. So, you must come out of that confusion. Amen. To get to a place of faith to get somewhere with God. Oh, and that that explains to us why there is such an attack on recognition in this day. Because brother Brandham said he's trying to get you to not realize who you are. Because if you don't know who you are, then he said that little hand raising, Satan will try to tell you that there's nothing to that. Amen. And if you'll believe that voice, Amen. And then the power behind the raising of your hand, the power behind the visit to the altar, [laughter] the power behind passing through the prayer line won't mean anything to you if Satan will talk you out of who you are. Amen. But if you'll recognize who you are, you'll recognize that when you raise your hand, amen, God is recognizing your heart and you're receiving the promise that you're raising your hand, too. When you're visiting an altar, amen, you are encountering a living God. Amen. If you meet in there, it's a real experience. And Satan would like to talk you out of that. Amen. But he is a liar. He is a bluff. Amen. He is identified by his characteristics. And he's a squatter. Amen. He's a deceiver. He's a perverter and a thief. Amen. But he's defeated. Amen. He has no power. He's limitless. Amen. It's the characteristics of Satan. Amen. He has no place in here tonight because he doesn't want you to recognize by revelation who you are. And he doesn't want you to recognize who he is. &gt;&gt; Because when Peter recognized, Amen. Jesus spoke back, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it." Oh, and Satan wants to prevail against you. So, he don't want you to recognize. Oh, but if you ever get the revelation, Amen, you can be talked into something and talked out. But when the revelation ever strikes your heart, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you when you recognize who you are. Oh, the church is not built upon Peter. The church is not built upon big buildings. The church is built upon revelation of who Jesus Christ is personally to you. Oh, that's why Satan hates the two books of the Bible. That's Genesis and Revelations &gt;&gt; because brother Brand said it reveals his ways. We find his origin, his awful ways and his destruction. [gasps] And Jesus said about Satan, he has no part in me and I have no part in him. And brother Bam said, "The devil would like to prove that different, but he cannot." So he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word. Didn't we hear that Sunday? But when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word, the gates of hell cannot prevail against her. Oh, I like what brother Brandham said. Satan hates revelation because it upsets his plans. I say, glory to God. [laughter] Amen. Satan had a plan for your life, but revelation came and it upset his plans. Amen. Satan wanted to keep you bound in those traditions, but revelation came and it upset his plans. He wanted to keep you bound in sickness. He wanted to keep you bound in fear. He wanted to keep you bound in depression. But revelation came one day and it upset the plans of Satan. And you recognize that he is the defeated devil. And when the spirit when the church recognizes those two spirits, when she recognizes what she is and what she stands for, she will become an invincible army. And the gates of hell will not be able to prevail against the church under revelation. Satan hates revelation because he hates to be exposed. That's what brother Brandham said. you watch a meeting. He said when that devil's right about to be exposed, he said the look on their face will begin to change because that devil knows he's about to be exposed. Amen. I say let's have an exposing meeting tonight. Amen. Let's expose Satan in false worship. Let's expose him in dead religion. Let's expose him in the fear he puts upon our daughters. Let's expose him in the pressure he puts upon our sons and expose Satan. And Satan will become powerless. And how will we expose him? By the preaching of the word of God. We'll expose Satan every time, everywhere, every place. You see, you're worried Satan's going to expose you. [laughter] Amen. But you're, as the word comes forth, not only does it expose Satan, but it exposes who you are. Amen. Because you're worried that Satan's going to expose you as not good enough. He's going to expose you as a liar. [laughter] He's going to expose you as foolish virgin. Amen. But I like what brother Brandham said. He said someone told him that two FBI agents were going to come down and expose him at that meeting. And so he said, "All right, if I'm doing something contrary to the word, then come expose [laughter] me. I want to be right." But when the Spirit of Revelation dropped into the building, [laughter] not only did it not expose Brother Brandham is wrong, but it exposed those two FBI FBI agents as backsliding preachers, and it exposed Brother Brandham as a true prophet of God. Oh, what the enemy meant for evil. God has worked for good. Satan has tried to expose you. And you've worried that you were going to be exposed. But when this message came over your life, it exposed the devil as a liar. And it exposed you as a son and daughter of God. It exposed you as an overcomer. It exposed you as a rapture ready born again son of the living God. When revelation came to your heart, oh this message, he said, I thought I was just a a shyer, but this message exposed that you were Jacob. He said, I thought I was just a doubter, but this message exposed that you were Thomas and your name is on the lamb's book of life because the word [laughter] of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Oh, when the enemy comes in like a flood, I will raise up a standard. Darkness and gross darkness, but arise, shine. Thy light has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. The light of the message has come to expose the enemy tonight. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's why we can say it's recognizing time. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon preached a message recognizing your day in his message. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Past 25 years, Israel has just recognized they're in the homeland for something." &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was prophesied they'd have to be gathered again. Hosea said so. We read it a while ago. We'll read it right now. Hosea 6. Come and let us return unto the Lord. For he hath torn and he will heal us. He has smitten and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us, but in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight. Brother Brandham said, "Israel has just recognized they're in the homeland for something. God, help us to understand it. At the same time, the bride has recognized the evening light and just begin to recognize the hungry Pentecostals have began to recognize that them organizations hasn't got anything. Hasn't got anything. The He said, just recognize the evening light. It hasn't got anything they're looking for. They're so twisted and tore up. See, he said, see, it's the time of recognition. You've got to recognize. &gt;&gt; The world has recognized. The nations has recognized. Science has recognized, the devil has recognized it's the time that he can wreck women, wreck the church, wreck the people. He's recognized it. And God has recognized that there's a people on earth that he predestinated to life. He recognized this is the time to send his message. The people has recognized it. The bright time has realized the evening light. Oh my. [laughter] Brother Brandon was preaching on to us in 1964. Recognize your day. In his message, he said, "I Hosea prophesied that in the third day, he would gather his children again." And it's been 2700 years when Brother Brandham preached it. And he's saying God is fulfilling his prophecy. He's gathering his nation, Israel, into the land. And Israel is only waiting for the bride to get out of the way so they can recognize their Messiah. And then he starts to say, "Why did Russia wake up? Why did the nations wake up? Why did science wake up? Why has man been able to achieve? And why has the church failed to recognize their day? You see, Israel had to be blinded so the church could recognize. But it's made a full circle. And the church is being blinded. Amen. So Israel can recognize. Amen. He said, "Oh, it's like a baby that brother Bram talked about not responding to that rattler." Amen. They can't recognize although it's coming to pass right in front of them. and they are naked, miserable, wretched, and blind because they didn't recognize. But at the same time, he said, "A bride has recognized the evening light." Amen. The world has not recognized the awakening of the bride. But she was awakened by the seven seals, saying, "Why are we here? Why are we in our homeland? Why have we been gathered together under Malachi 4?" A mean why is all this taking place? Amen. We were not put here by national force, but we were put here by the power of the message of the hour. The power of God has gathered a bride that she might begin to recognize, amen, that this is our season. Oh, if Israel's season is coming after we're taken away, then our season must not be off in the future. Our season must be now. Oh, brother Bam said, "Why has science just in the last few years been able to realize that they cannot just travel 30 m an hour, but they can travel 17,000 m an hour? Why has it happened? It had to be that way." Amen. Because we've come into an age of new possibilities. Amen. Things have begin to awaken. [laughter] The bride has begun to recognize that we are not in Luther's day anymore. We are not in Wesley's day anymore, but we are in the astronaut age. Amen. Recognize the potential. Amen. Of what could happen in a meeting like this. Amen. There has been an awakening, brother Carrie. The bride is recognizing her position in the word of God. Amen. Not looking back. That's been the fault through the ages. Looking back, when Jesus was here, they looked back to say, "Oh, we believe Moses. We're Moses disciples." Amen. Amen. If you would just Amen. say what Moses said. He said, "If you would have believed Moses, you would have believed me." The church has been looking back. [laughter] Amen. Looking in the rearview mirror, Amen. to a day gone by. And that's Satan's tactic still tonight to try to get you to look behind you, to miss the blessing that is taking place right now. Amen. That's why he's trying to keep you tore up with all kinds of things and all kinds of trouble. Keep you tore up at your brother, keep you tore up at your sister. But it is a season to lay aside the things that are behind and press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling. Amen. Forget those things which are behind you. Say it's hard. It's hard to let go. It's hard to forgive. But wouldn't it be worth it? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth it to get your joy back? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth it to get your peace back? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth it to be a real father again? Wouldn't it be worth it to be a real mother again? Wouldn't it be worth it to let go and stop looking back and release it into the blood and move forward into the promises of God? Church, this is your season to be blessed. Amen. This is revival time. [cheering] Amen. We don't need another awakening. We just need a recognition that revival is here tonight. Oh, you say, "I'm hungry for revival, Brother Isaac." I say it's here. I say it's only time to get on board. Oh, you say, "What if the church moves on without me?" How can the church move on without you when you are the church? I mean, we're waiting on you to get in the revival and become a part of it yourself. Oh, we can't go without our sons. We can't go without our daughters. We can't go without our elders. We can't go without our young people. Amen. Revival is here. [laughter] Amen. The set time to favor Zion has come. It's a season of blessing. It's a season of recognition. Amen. That we are not looking to the millennium. Now we are sons and daughters of God. Now we are the children of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, a season of recognizing. Amen. When I was a child, I spake as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things. And Paul said, for we'd see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as I am known. &gt;&gt; You know, when we named our son Spencer Warren Hatfield, he was always Spencer Warren Hatfield. &gt;&gt; But he didn't know it for a while. I mean, but as he began to grow, we begin to tutor him. Your name is Spencer. &gt;&gt; Your name is Spencer Warren Hatfield. &gt;&gt; And now we can tell him, "Hey buddy, are are you a dinosaur?" story. He said, "No." "Are you a chicken?" "No, you're a crocodile, aren't you?" "No, I'm Spencer Warren Hatfield." And it comes right out of his mouth because when I he was a baby, you might have been able to deceive him, but when he sat under the tutorship of his father and mother, Amen. Good luck trying to deceive him. Now, he already knows who he is. Amen. And there shall arise false Christ and false prophets. that shall arise false spirits. But to you who have been sitting under the tutorship of the message of the hour, the elect cannot be deceived because you've already recognized who you are. And brother Brandham said that is for this day because this is the age of the coming of the Lord. This is the time when we will go from partial realization to perfect realization where we will have a perfect realization. Amen. Of who we are, of who he is. And I know that lays in the coming of the Lord, but I believe it is taking place right now under the message of the hour. We have come from partial understanding to perfect understanding of who we are, of who the devil is, and of who our God is. Amen. This message brought proper identification. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery should be finished. Evening time, it shall be light. Amen. Properly identifying. If you want to know what a Christian looks like, Brother Josh, search the message. If you want to know what the three poles are, search the message. Brother Brandham said, they've been properly identified. If you want to know what the seventh angel is going to look like, search the message. He'll be like Elijah. He'll be an outdoorsman. He'll be a he'll be a woodsman. He'll be against Jezebel. And if you want to know what this message, if you want to know if this message is true, just search the scripture. &gt;&gt; Search the message. It's been properly identified. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Spirits that have always existed. Now we can describe what they are like. &gt;&gt; You say, "What's a nickelan spirit?" We can describe it perfectly &gt;&gt; because under the second pole of this message, Amen. Amen. Every spirit has been properly identified. Amen. We could compile the prayer lines and you could write a thesaurus. Amen. Of nervous spirits, of depression spirits, amen, of anxiety, of oppression, of every spirit there is. Because brother Brandham encountered them and under that second pole, Amen. It identified every spirit. Amen. That you and me might be able to overcome that devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Amen. Satan has recognized his season. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that he has because brother Brandham said it. It's the season that he can wreck woman. It's the season he can wreck the church. &gt;&gt; But it's a season. And I want him to recognize his season because I mean, it's only a span of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there will come a time where he will be cast into the lake of fire &gt;&gt; and his season will be over. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even while he's here, we have been given the ability to overcome him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "How do you overcome?" To recognize the devil in every one of his tricks. You must recognize him real. You must must recognize him a devil. You must recognize he's against you. You must recognize his tricks. And then you can recognize that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is he a devil? &gt;&gt; Yes. Is he real? Brother Brandham said he's a real devil. Just like Jesus Christ is not a thought, but he's a real person. &gt;&gt; Is he against you? Yes. I don't think we have to even take 10 minutes to explain that to you tonight. If Satan is not after you, he's got you. Brother Brandham said. But as long as he's after you, it shows that he hasn't got you yet. So just keep on moving forward. Amen. But he's against you. You say, "Why am I thinking these thoughts?" Because the devil's against you. You say, "Why am I going through such a hard time?" Because sometimes Satan knows your future better than you know it yourself. And he knows that you're going to grow up to be a minister. And so he attacks you. And he attacks you. Ever before you know your identity, Satan is attacking you. And it isn't until you recognize your identity that you can recognize why you were going through those things. Amen. Every son and daughter of God. Amen. When you're still in that struggle, you wonder why you're going through the things. Why am I like this? But when you identify yourself as a son or a daughter, then you can identify why you were going to through the things that you were going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Satan's got a right to that punch. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to guard that area. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't try to live at peace with the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaac and Ishmael cannot live at peace together. &gt;&gt; You can watch it taking place right now. So don't try to live at peace with the devil. Amen. Don't try to live at peace with that habit. Don't try to live at peace with that addiction. He's against you. He's your adversary. Amen. He's a liar. He's a destroyer. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? Amen. You must recognize his tricks. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then here's one I want to deal with. He's got a lot of tricks, [snorts] &gt;&gt; but brother Bram said when the devil likes to, he says, "And they were very downcast." It's so easy to become, especially when you are oppressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil likes to work on you and oppress you. You know that's a trick of the devil to oppress. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when the Christian knows his legal rights, when you can quote God's word, I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee, that takes all the oppression away, and the clouds begin to clear back. If you just know God has promised and God is faithful, he can keep his promise or he wouldn't have promised it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The definition of oppression is cruel, unfair, and prolonged mistreatment or control of people, often by those in power, taking away their freedom, rights, and opportunities through unjust law, systems, or actions, creating hardship and misery. It's more than an isolated incident. It's the systematic pervasive pattern of limiting a group like based on race, gender, or beliefs, and making them feel burdened or crushed. Amen. If you've ever been under an oppressive spirit, you know what that's like. Brother Brandon would call him out in prayer lines and say, "Here, it's a little nervous mother." And Satan's trying to take her life. He's trying to shorten her days. Amen. [snorts] By an oppressive spirit, nervousness, oppression. He said, "The oppression of pride, the oppression of thinking that you send away your day of grace." He said, "There's [snorts] many people here tonight that really wants to come right here. I believe it's to the altar. But the oppression of the devil is trying to hold you back. The oppression, oppression of nervousness, oppression of depression, oppression of fear, oppression of of not knowing who you are. And when brother said, "The oppression of the enemy is strong, but thou art stronger. And greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world." And that's how you overcome the devil is to recognize greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world. Amen. You see there's a difference between oppression and possession. Amen. Oppression is a cloud that hangs over you. Amen. Possession means that he's got you. And that's what you want to recognize about oppression is that it's just means that Satan is attacking you but he cannot get you because possession means that he owns you. Amen. And so Satan cannot get you because God already has you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like that lying spirit that came and got into those 400 preachers in the days of Ahab and Jehoshaphat. Amen. But he couldn't get into Micaiah because Micaiah was a word prophet of God. Amen. And God got to you before Satan could ever get to you. And so Satan can only oppress you. But he cannot possess you because God came. And before the foundation of the world, he sealed your spiritual womb with the seed of God. Oh, amen. Can you help me tonight? Amen. God sealed your womb before the devil ever got to you. And you are sealed and you are his tonight. Amen. Because before the foundation of the world, he put the predestinated band of unmmerited grace and favor on your life and sealed you. Amen. A seal means ownership. It means that Satan cannot get you any longer because God already sealed you before the foundation of the world. Oh, you were his. You may not recognize it yet, [laughter] but if your name is on that book, Amen. And you may not even have the Holy Ghost yet, but that earthly seal is coming because God has already recognized you in heaven. Oh, glory. And he will recognize your faith and give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Because recognizing doesn't change your identity. It only realizes who you are. That's why the prodigal son could only go so far before he had to come to himself and recognize that he was still the son of his father. And my brother Bam said, "You always were a son of God. It's not what you will be. It's not what you're going to be. You have always been. And you will always be a son of God." And you must recognize. Amen. Even if you don't recognize it yet, Brother Brandon would say about Sarah, [sighs] you know, she doubted Abraham. She doubted the word of Melzdc. And brother Brandham said, "I feel led of the Lord to say this in a meeting one time." He said, "You may be doubting me now, but I can see past that. That one of these days you're going to believe it. I can see farther than that. You may be doubting me now. You may be oppressed by a spirit of unbelief now, but I can see past that. that one of these days, Terara, because you are a part of Abraham, I cannot curse you and you will come to recognition that this is nothing but the truth. I mean, you say, "I can't see it, brother Isaac." But we can see farther than that. If there's a seed on the inside of your life, Satan cannot stop you from [snorts] coming to the recognition of who you are. Oh, brother, I'm under a different cloud. Amen. I like what brother Brandham said. He said, "I was listening to demonology and he said, "An oppression looks like a cloud." And immediately my mind went to the place that Satan is only a perverter. Amen. And he would try to make an oppression like a cloud. Amen. But I'm under a different cloud. I'm under that cloud. That brother Brandham saw appear out above Arizona and said, "That is our Lord up there. That's the cloud I'm under. Satan may oppress you and it may be above you, but I'm not under it. Oh, how's that work, Brother Isaac? It's above me, but I'm not under it because I am under the headship of this message. I am under the realization that I came from God and I'm going back to God. And there's not enough devils in hell that can stop me from coming to where I am. Oh, brother Bham said this sister had a dream that she was walking in white sands, but she was walking in darkness. And brother Brandham interpreted her. She said, "Now I'm nervous. My family is nervous. We're all nervous." And brother Bham said, "Sister, the very white sands proves that you are walking in purity and righteousness. It's only a devil that's made you nervous, and now your whole family's nervous. You see, she was under darkness, but she wasn't under the devil's rule. She was a daughter walking in purity and righteousness. And it's the lie of the devil that'll try to make you nervous and try to make you depressed and make you think that you're going to hell. But I'm telling you, young man, there is a real God that is calling you, come out of the darkness. There is a man that can turn on the light and let you know that you always were a son of God. You are not under it. You are under the identification of this word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. Brother Bam said there's clouds of judgment forming. Amen. But we are not under the clouds of judgment. We are under a prophecy. Amen. That before those clouds can rain down in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, I will catch my bride away. Amen. The clouds have no power over your identity. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a cloud. It's a storm, but it has no power over your identity. Your future is clear. What side of the prophecy are you on? When they shall say, "Peace and safety, sudden destruction shall come." But you are not children of the darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. But ye are children of the light. And before darkness has its time, and when the light time has come, &gt;&gt; and the brightest recognized the evening light at the rising of the sun. Oh, it's the season of recognition. At the rising of the sun, black clouds are leaving. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham said, remember it was promised that the clouds would clear away in the evening time and in the evening time. Clouds have brushed back. &gt;&gt; Clouds of formality have brushed back. Clouds of the days of miracles have passed have brush brushed back. Oh, but at the same time, brother Josh. Amen. Then he shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven. And then shall the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the son of man coming. And the clouds of heaven with power and with great glory. Oh, black clouds are leaving and clouds of power and glory are coming. Brother Brandham said John 5:24, "He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come in the condemnation, but has passed from death unto life." Brother Brandham said, "Then the black clouds of death &gt;&gt; has sailed from over 50 or 75 people in here tonight, and clouds of light have come to them." Oh brother, at the rising of the sun, when those seals begin to break open, clouds of darkness would begin to roll off of the church of the living God. And as they rolled away, clouds of light begin to roll over the church. Clouds of power and glory, clouds of joy and peace, clouds of prodigals coming home. Amen. The cloud, oh, it has no power over your identity. I say, let the clouds of glory roll over the church tonight. Amen. Let the shakina glory, Amen, roll over your hearts and your minds tonight. And let's have a cloud breaking service. &gt;&gt; Oh, because at the rising of the sun was when the emancipation proclamation was declared, where they recognized that they were free. And he which the sun has made free is free indeed. [laughter] And he is here to blow a mighty rushing wind to roll the clouds away. Why is he rolling him away, brother Carrie? So his attributes could display themselves. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. The cloud is not the attribute. The cloud is what it has to get through. But the attribute is what's laying inside. That's the real you. The attribute is the son or daughter. Oh, I've about had enough of that spirit of pressure and fear. Amen. In the building, I've about had enough. Amen. Our young sisters were created for joy. You were created to have a dance. You were created to have peace. You were created to have a sound mind. It is a devil. It is an oppression. But it is not a possession. Satan [cheering] cannot get you because God got you first. Oh, I said, "Get out of the building, Satan. There's no clouds welcome in here tonight." Amen. This is reserved for the clouds of glory. This is reserved for the son of God. Oh, Satan cannot stop you from recognizing who you are. &gt;&gt; And I like a good storm anyway, Brother Carrie. I like the rain of his blessings. I like the lightning of his presence. I like the thunder of his voice. I like the clouds of his power and glory when they come [cheering] over your life and begin to set you free. There's joy in the house of the Lord tonight. There's joy in the presence of the Lord. Satan is defeated and the son of man has arised with healing in his wings to let you know that Satan never had you in the first place. Oh, there's joy for you. There's a fresh victory for you tonight if you can recognize it. Amen. You were never his, but you always were a son of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, it had a beginning. [snorts] You say, "It's just the way I am, Brother Isaac." [panting] But brother Brandham could identify. You were bit by a dog when you were just a little boy and it made you nervous your whole life. You say, "I've always been that way, Brother Isaac. It must be my nature." No, it had a beginning &gt;&gt; and it will have an end. &gt;&gt; Amen. That didn't just happen once. Brother Brandham discerned that dog biting about seven times caused nervousness. At least seven times I found a dog bit someone and it caused a nervous spirit. And you think it's your identity and you think it's the way you're always going to be. But I'm here to tell you, amen, that this message has discerned it and said, "No, it's a liar. It's a nervous spirit." And it's time that it lets you go and you recognize, amen, that it had a beginning and this is the end. Amen. It is not you. It's a cloud. &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan. You're a liar. &gt;&gt; You know, you start preaching about that though, and someone might start thinking that that that that, well, what about me? I was actually possessed. The He had me so much till he spoke through my lips. &gt;&gt; What about Mary Magdalene, &gt;&gt; Brother Josiah? She was possessed with seven devils. &gt;&gt; She didn't even know she had them. She had pride. She was a strip tease. She had lust. She had all kinds of spirits. But when she met a man, he said, "Be thou clean." And when his voice spoke out, the seven devils left and she became a clean daughter of God. And that voice can still speak tonight. You see, I feel so dirty. I'm looking at things I shouldn't look at. And it's made me feel so dirty. But the voice of the Lord is still speaking tonight, saying, "Be thou clean." And the voice in whatever speaks over you, it can make you clean. Oh, glory. It didn't stop there. Amen. because she was the first one to witness him after he rose in the resurrection and then she went to the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost. You say possessed. I was possessed. I can't be bride. Mary Magdalene was. She was possessed. But then she witnessed him at his resurrection. She went to the upper room and got the Holy Ghost and she is a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Her name is on the lamb's book of life. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You say there's a woman example. We'll give you a man example. &gt;&gt; Legion was in Geria. &gt;&gt; It was a man with an unclean spirit. &gt;&gt; You say he was an unclean man. That's not what it said. &gt;&gt; He said he was a man with an unclean spirit. &gt;&gt; You got to separate your battle from your identity. &gt;&gt; You say I'm depressed. No, you're not. You're a daughter with a spirit of depression attacking you. You say, "I am I'm I'm defeated." No, you're not. You say, "I'm anxious." No, you're not. You're a son, and there's a spirit trying to get come against your life. It's not the man. It's the devil that makes him do those things. But it was a man with an unclean spirit. And he was dwelling among tombs. Brother Brham said, "That's where the devils like to dwell." &gt;&gt; A man, he said, "You take an unbeliever that believes the power is no longer here and the days of miracles are passed." He said, "That's a good place for the devils." He said, "But truthfully, cold, formal churches that deny the power of God," he said, "they become a hangout for devils." He said, "The colder the church gets, it becomes a hangout for the devil." And that's why Legion found himself in a graveyard cutting himself, crying out, "Oh, that cutting spirit didn't die, did it? It's still alive. It's still depression. It's still trying to make daughters cut themselves. Amen. But it's a devil. But when he saw Jesus, he ran and he worshiped him and he recognized him. Oh my my my. You mean Satan knows this message is true? Oh yeah, he does. You think those people that disbelieve the sign, the devil's got them so fooled, they're making websites about how it's false, and he knows it's true better than most Christians. Amen. Because when he was in legion and Jesus came in, he said, "Thou art the Christ." And he fell and worshiped him. He recognized him to be the son of God. And Jesus said, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Leion." &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, yeah." &gt;&gt; He knew it, but he wanted them to confess it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Cast us into the swine." How did it begin? Brother Bram said, "He took a drink and the devil came in. &gt;&gt; He lied and the devil came in. He did this thing and that thing and before he knew it he was legion possessed by many devils and the law couldn't help him. &gt;&gt; Haven't we seen that? &gt;&gt; The law &gt;&gt; legalism couldn't help him. &gt;&gt; Works couldn't help him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beating him over the head. Oh glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saying you can't wear this. You can't do this. You can't do that. You think that would have helped Legion. You think a good 10step program was what he needed in the middle of that graveyard with the legion of devils on him? No. He needed a real God. Amen. But he wanted a revival when the rest of them didn't. Can you imagine a man possessed with the le legion of devils and he was the only one that wanted the revival? &gt;&gt; The rest of them didn't want it because it would cost them too much. And brother Brandon would say and that they'd rather stay in that condition than have a little wildfire because it cost them too much because they were hog farmers. And those spirits wanted to get in those hogs. Well, you know what that made me think of? Brother Brandham said these denominations trying to build their churches. He said it's like bringing more pigs to the pen and they don't want a revival because they'll lose all their pig members if they let the power of God into the church. Amen. Oh, we are not here to bring pigs to the pan. We are here to bring eagles to the carcass. That's why we let let revival come. Let the power of God fall. Let the pillar of fire sweep through the building and deliver Mary Magdalene and deliver Legion. Oh, let the revival come. We are not scared of revival. We'll pay the price. We'll throw out every dirty thing. We'll upheave every pew and every seed. Say, "God, take it out of my life. I'm ready to be free." &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, but he met a living God. And that voice spoke and gave those evil spirits leave. And he went home, Brother Carrie. And the wife started to hide, say, "Don't do it again. Don't do it again." The children begin to scream, "No, daddy. Don't do it again." Oh God, [sighs and panting] I don't know who's here tonight. If you're in that place, &gt;&gt; he said, "You might be a daddy. You might not be a legion. [panting] Maybe you're a drunk and you're home. Your wife's scared of you. Your children are scared of you. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; but when Jesus comes on the scene, &gt;&gt; he can take you and change you around." And Legion was sitting there clothed and in his right mind and said, "No, come here, my son. Come here, my daughter." Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Daddy's met Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Daddy has met Jesus. And when you meet Jesus, I don't care what condition you're in. He is a God that can take you out of your condition and save your life and fill you with the Holy Ghost and deliver you to be a son or daughter of God. He can take you out of drugs. He can take you out of alcohol. Is it true, Brother Kyle? Is that the kind of God we serve? Hey, he can take you out of the darkest pits and set you on the right path because when you recognize his presence, it brings hope. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Brother Bram said? that if he is present, everything is settled. &gt;&gt; He said, "You might be sitting here with cancer. You might be sitting here with TB. You're in a helpless condition. [laughter] You're in a hopeless condition." But Brother Bram said, "Yet to be in the presence in recognition of the presence of Jesus Christ brings hope again." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. If you recognize his presence, it brings hope again. You've heard this testimony of Donnie Morton or I believe that's yeah Donnie Morton. He lived in Saskatchewan. He was he was four years old and they diagnosed him with a hopeless brain condition. And they went to doctor after doctor and they couldn't find any answers and he started to develop a limp. And so they said, "We've got to take him to the doctor again." And they went through the blizzards and they that just to get to the doctor and the doctor said he's got a six-month prognosis and and he's going to die. It's a hopeless brain condition. And and and and he he would stay there for observation. But but it's in Reader's Digest. I'm sure you all heard it. &gt;&gt; Amen. They said they would not accept the word hopeless. And when Brother Brandham tells it, he tells it over and over again. His daddy would kept telling him, "We're not whipped yet, Donnie. We're not whipped yet." And his father remembered there was a man named William Marian Brandom. And in his meetings, two of his co-workers had been healed of deafness. and he said, "If I can just get to him, God will do something for my baby." So, he sold his cows and went on a 2,800 mile bus trip and arrived at the meeting 18 months after the baby was declared hopeless and they got traveler's aid to get to the meeting and they went down there and brother Brandon prayed for him and I'm sure you all remember the prayer. It was the prayer of the old country doctor saying, "If you go, you'll meet this doctor. the only hopes for this baby is the power of God in that surgery. And so they went out and they met the doctor just like he said and the baby had the surgery and the baby began to get totally well. &gt;&gt; Now the critics might look at that and say, "Well, if you know the full story, the baby died shortly thereafter." But brother Brandon must have had a vision or something because he said that the nurses actually left the window cracked open and a draft blew in and the day the baby didn't die of the disease. He died of pneumonia and menitis. Amen. Because a daddy had enough faith to realize that there's someone on the scene that if I can just get my baby to that person, then he would be well. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham said, "I was in the Mayo Clinic, helpless, going to die. I was a helpless case. But God met me and now I weigh more than I ever did. Now I'm stronger than I've ever been. I'm healthier than I've ever been. And case after case would come through the prayer line. He would say, "It's hopeless. It's hopeless." But there's a God. &gt;&gt; Yes, [snorts] sir. &gt;&gt; That can meet you. You say, "Well, that was just for brother Brandham's day. What about our day?" &gt;&gt; Well, you can have the revelation that Martha had when Lazarus was in a hopeless condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was laying in the grave for 4 days. Amen. But Martha had a revelation because she read the story of the Shounomite woman, how the baby came to life through Elijah and how the word come to the prophets. And so God was in Elijah, but it didn't stay there. But she said, "If God is in Elijah, surely he's in his son." And she said, "Even now, Lord, you can come on the scene for Lazarus." and Lazarus raised from the grave when you caught the revelation that God wasn't just with Elijah, but God is the same today. And he's with his son tonight. He's with his word tonight. He's with his message tonight. And so, we can stand here and say that there's people all through this congregation that couldn't have babies. They were hopeless, but they have babies tonight because he is still here. Amen. I've got a wife that was in a hopeless condition. The doctors didn't know what was wrong. Amen. But she's well tonight because he is still here. You say, "It looks hopeless, Brother Isaac. What will we do?" I'll tell you. We'll do like Abraham did. Against hope, we'll believe in hope. Brother Abraham said, Abraham didn't even have hope. But he had faith and hope when hope wasn't even there. Oh, glory. It may look hopeless, but you can have faith and hope when hope isn't even there. Oh, we're not whipped yet, church. We're not whipped yet. He is still here. He is still on the scene. And as long as we know he is here, it's not too late. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say it's too late, Brother Isaac. It's not too late. I don't know who told you you would not make it. &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you you could not take it. &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you it's time that you quit. But my God said, "Wait, it ain't over yet. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It ain't over till I say it's over. And as long as he's still here, I say it ain't over yet. It ain't over. As long as the presence of God is still here. &gt;&gt; I remember what it was like, brother Daniel. I was in a cloud of confusion. We were in the greenhouse and our pastor began to preaching on it's too late. &gt;&gt; It's too late. And I stand here tonight and I look at where God's brought me in five years. &gt;&gt; I got a wife. I got a baby. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; I know I'm a son. I know what he called me here to do. I know the clouds have rolled away because when I thought it was too late, it wasn't too late because he is still here. &gt;&gt; Oh, there will come a time where it's too late. But as long as he's here, it's not too late, friends. &gt;&gt; If we only had 5 minutes left, that's enough. Amen. For him to come and step in on the scene and meet you where you're at and set you free. Amen. and deliver you and heal you and amen fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But if you can't see he's he's here, you get discouraged. &gt;&gt; That's what they were doing. Cleopus Cleopus and his friend on the road to Emmas. They were discouraged. &gt;&gt; They were really discouraged. And Jesus was walking with them. He said, "Why are you sad?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Said, "Don't you know they crucified Jesus of Nazareth? And we trusted he was the one to redeem redeem Israel. &gt;&gt; And don't you know besides that, this is the third day. &gt;&gt; Oh, and Jesus. Oh, but don't you know what Hosea prophesied? This is the third day. You think it's hopeless, &gt;&gt; but this is when recognition is going to come &gt;&gt; in the third day. &gt;&gt; And he began to break the scriptures open to them. And they begin to have their eyes open and realize who he was as he expounded the scriptures to him. And I say, "This is the third day. &gt;&gt; Hope has returned. He is here. My ministry is to declare him. He is here. I must decrease, but he must increase. Lo, I will be with you always. I will never leave you nor forsake you." Just as the legions came to possess a man. Brother Brandham said, "Does legions come to the righteous?" He said, "Yes, they do. The angels shall be encamped round about him about them that fear him and believe him." That's why brother Brandham could say, "Let not your hearts be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me." &gt;&gt; And he began to tie that to his ministry. He said, "You know what the angel told me? If you can get the people to believe you, nothing will stand in the way, not even cancer." He said, "You believe God, that's good. That's what you're supposed to do. He said, "But you could believe God and not believe this and it wouldn't do you any good. You must believe this if you want hope for your life." They couldn't swallow that there was somebody possessing that man. They couldn't swallow that the angel was present in their midst. They couldn't swallow that Jesus had returned in the ministry of a man named William Brandon. Brother Brandon was preaching a meeting on the Holy Ghost and he said, "Blessed is he that believeth." He said, "For two or three days, blessed is he that believeth." It said, "Then inspiration spoke. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." He said, "Before I knew it, things begin to speak again. Blessed is he that believes the Lord has come in this." Oh, glory. You're blessed to believe God. You're blessed to believe a historical God. Oh, but you are blessed if you believe the God that has come in this message. &gt;&gt; You let not your hearts troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. And because you believe this message, hope has returned to your situation. Oh, when you recognize the presence of God, his power is released onto you. If it's not recognized, Brother Elijah, it's held in a bottle. But when the woman at the well recognized him, it released deliverance. &gt;&gt; When the woman with the blood issue recognized him, it released healing. &gt;&gt; When the woman, Amen, that washed his feet recognized him, it released joy and it released forgiveness. And when Hattie Wright recognized this message to be the truth and said it's nothing but the truth, it released the power to save her children. Because when you recognize, Amen, that God is still here, it releases power. &gt;&gt; Oh, his power is releasing even during this service as sons and daughters are recognizing power is being released to deliver you, to heal you, to set you free, and to raise you out of your condition. and blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. Oh, as you begin to recognize him, you say, "Oh, God, thank you for your grace." &gt;&gt; Because I'll tell you another thing recognition brings. It brings worship. &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus rode in fulfilling that word &gt;&gt; on that donkey, &gt;&gt; they begin to say, "Hosana. Hosana. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana." And brother Brandham said, "There was a divided opinion that day because the scribes and Pharisees said, "Who is this? What is all this shouting about?" And the disciples said, "Don't you know that scripture must be fulfilled by Zachchariah that he would come into the city riding on that white donkey, riding on the vindicated word?" And the children begin to cry, "Hosana." And the scribe said, "What are you crying about? What are you doing?" And the disciples said, "The reason that we're so excited is because this scripture has been fulfilled." And the scribe said, "Who is this? Why are these children crying?" And he was sore displeased. But Jesus said, and he quoted to them the book of Psalms, "Don't you know that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, praise is perfected." Oh, so you can call me a holy roller if you want to. You can call me a bubble dancer if you want to. But I have recognized that Jesus has returned in the message of the hour. I have recognized that hope has returned. Hope for a rapture. Hope for a body change. Hope for my children to be saved has come riding into the camp. I say hosana. Hosana. How could you recognize without worshiping &gt;&gt; when John saw his name on the book? He said, "Heaven and earth heard I John saying blessing and honor and glory and power." And he said, "I've seen jumping spells and joy spells, but I didn't see anything wrong because it was in a meeting like that where people were recognizing that their name was on the Lamb's book of life." Oh, and don't rejoice because demons are subject to you, but rejoice that your name is written in heaven. I say recognition brings worship. We have not failed to recognize who is in our midst. We have not failed to recognize that Jesus Christ has returned today and he is here. Amen. We recognize him. That's why we worship him. That's why the woman at the well could say, "Come see a man who's told me the very things that I've done." &gt;&gt; And she worshiped and she praised him. &gt;&gt; [gasps] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't praise because our identity is not based on our praise. &gt;&gt; Our praise is based on our identity &gt;&gt; because we recognized &gt;&gt; who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What greater recognition could there be? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Than to recognize him. &gt;&gt; What greater recognition could there be? See, that's what the second poll came for. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We could recognize the devil. We could recognize Christ is here. &gt;&gt; But that as that third poll begin to come. &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; We begin to recognize. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who are we? &gt;&gt; Where did we come from? &gt;&gt; And where are we going? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, and brother Brandon begin to preach. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. This great mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Christ in you makes you the center of the whole revelation. Well, &gt;&gt; you begin to recognize your position in the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew the word written about him. &gt;&gt; That's why without a shadow of a doubt, he could go to Calvary because he knew the word said that you can destroy this temple and within three days I will raise it up. &gt;&gt; And when you recognize who you are, &gt;&gt; I mean, you can go through every trial and every heartache because you know the word that's written over you. They shall overcome them by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. &gt;&gt; The wise shall do exploits in that day. &gt;&gt; Greater works than these shall you do. &gt;&gt; Recognizing what part of the word you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because brother Bram said, "If ye abide in me and my word and you ask what you will, &gt;&gt; are you in Christ?" &gt;&gt; Amen. He that believeth in me, he said, "Not on me, in me." Yeah. &gt;&gt; These works shall you do. &gt;&gt; If you're in me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And if you recognize your position, you recognize Satan's position is under your feet tonight. &gt;&gt; Said you got too much fear. You don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; But as you begin to recognize who you are, you'll recognize Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; He's a liar. &gt;&gt; He's got a bow and no arrows. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is, we are dealing with a defeated devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the bride finally recognizes, &gt;&gt; so when she realizes her position, then the rapture will go. When she recognizes who she is, &gt;&gt; he knows your name tonight. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what [sighs] after Peter said, "Thou art the Christ," &gt;&gt; the Lord would speak back to him, "Thou art Peter. &gt;&gt; Your name's no longer Simon. I call you Peter." &gt;&gt; And when Jacob had an experience with the angel, Amen. He would speak back, "What is your name?" He said, "Jacob." He said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob. It shall be called Israel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I say, "What is your name tonight?" &gt;&gt; What is your name? &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Your name is bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jesus knew what Legion's name was, but he wanted them to confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this message knows who you are, but it's waiting for you to confess it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm no longer anxious. I'm no longer defeated. I'm no longer depressed. My name is no longer, Amen, this disease or that disease. My name is bride. My name is Mrs. Jesus Christ. Amen. As you begin to recognize that, it begins to put an authority in your life. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what's it like? Brother Troy, brother tells that story about that boy in the mirror. He said he got to wandering around playing in the house one day and the first time he saw himself in that mirror. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why mama? That's me." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Brother Brandham beginning to recognize himself in the scripture for the first time? Wow. &gt;&gt; As he's riding with brother Ed Bisco in the car, he says, "Brother Ed, &gt;&gt; do you think that this could be the ministry of Elijah? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Do you think?" &gt;&gt; And he begins to take him through all the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And brother Ed would say, he would say, "You know, I just it has all the means. It has all the identity of being that, Brother Brandham." &gt;&gt; And that angel begin to settle into that car. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But what about the first time you begin to look &gt;&gt; you begin to open that message book &gt;&gt; and you begin to read &gt;&gt; you begin to say, "Could it be?" &gt;&gt; Could it be, Brother Levi? Could it be? &gt;&gt; I thought this was a good story, but could it be this is my story? &gt;&gt; Could it be this is my rapture? &gt;&gt; Could it be this is my body change? &gt;&gt; Could it be? You begin to read, "Since you was a little boy, you was always different than those other kids." Say, "Well, that one checks off." &gt;&gt; Maybe more ways than one. [panting] And you begin to read, "You were desperate for the birthight." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That checks off. &gt;&gt; You begin to read and the more you read, like brother Brandham in the prayer lines, he begin to describe them and describe them and say, "Will it help you if I tell you who you are?" &gt;&gt; There you go. And you be this message begin to describe you and they said &gt;&gt; so that it'll help you. I'll call you bride. &gt;&gt; This is who you are. &gt;&gt; This is what it's all about. This is your position. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that you might understand &gt;&gt; you are my bride. &gt;&gt; Would you stand to your feet tonight? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that's the reason you enjoy it. You Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, and Presbyterians and so forth enjoy that presence. Somewhere in you, you've accepted God. &gt;&gt; Maybe sometime in an intellectual way, you felt the power of God and you are a servant of God. But when you can really come into God and recognize your place in him as a son or daughter of God, that's what brings that great thrill to you that God intended you to have. And if you've ever found that thrill, brother, it's my desire for every person in this world to get that thrill &gt;&gt; to recognize who you are, &gt;&gt; to recognize who your enemy is and to recognize that he is here. Brother Brandham said, "If we could only do that tonight, people, if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose." Can that be these meetings this weekend? &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; For one purpose, that's to release our desires that we have in him to us. &gt;&gt; I believe he's appearing in these meetings for one purpose. that to those who look for him, he shall appear &gt;&gt; and release the desires of your heart unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's your desire this weekend? You say, "I desire the Holy Ghost, Brother Isaac. &gt;&gt; I desire to have my joy back. I desire to have my peace back. &gt;&gt; I desire fresh revival in my life. I desire more revelation. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's here?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I believe he's here to release those desires onto you. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you desire. &gt;&gt; Ask what you will and it shall be given unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. You are not a god ced [music] by human hands. You are not a [singing] god dependent [music] anymore. [singing] You are not a god in [music] need of anything [singing] we can give by your plan. [music and singing] That's just the way it is. [music] Oh, [singing and music] you are not a god cedated by human hands. [music and singing] You are not a god or [music and singing] any mortal man. You are not a god in need of [music] anything we can give by your plan. [music] That's [singing] just the way it is. [music] For [singing] you [music] are God alone. from before time began.

[music] [applause] Hallelujah. Brother, I'm not under no cloud and depression. &gt;&gt; I don't live under no cloud in neurotics. I live under a pillar of fire, the cloud of the day. Amen. Well, I I tell you, somebody said, "Well, that pillar of fire now that that that don't that don't appear over the head of the men of God, the last day." Well, you know, I thank God we've got a message. &gt;&gt; I thank God we got a message. You know how many times, Brother Bannon seen that pillar of fire over people? &gt;&gt; And if he was here tonight, he could tell you, he could tell you that it's right here in this building. And he'd say, "I see it right there, and I see it over that head. I said don't. Amen. Because he's still alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. His name is Jesus &gt;&gt; and he's still alive tonight. &gt;&gt; He's here to empower you as a believer to to come over you to get over your head. I always loved it that when when the when the angel of the Lord, [music] our Lord Jesus, took a picture with brother Brandham, he didn't he he he he didn't appear under his foot. He didn't appear, you know, under his arm, &gt;&gt; but he appeared over his head. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he had superior authority. And that's the way he appears today. &gt;&gt; And and and isn't it beautiful that he comes right over your thinking? &gt;&gt; He comes right over the way you develop your mind, the way you think about [music] things, the way you think about yourself. That great Holy Spirit would come right in here and do that tonight. You know, I I I I so appreciated the man of God tonight [music] to separate the unclean spirit from the man. &gt;&gt; That was a man with an unclean spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh my my goodness. Cuz because you know what? There's a power here tonight that can un remove every unclean spirit. &gt;&gt; He can remove everything that that is not a part of that original identity. God never created a fallen son. &gt;&gt; He created sons. And those sons are alive tonight. His mercy is coming to this place. You know, uh years ago, we were we're reading something. Brother Ram said this. It's it's just so powerful is brother Ram is discerning and he comes across two women sitting in his meeting and one of them has hay fever. And brother Bam discerns the woman, calls her by name, and says to the sister, "You're suffering with hay fever. You're sitting there." And he says, "Now, in the name of Jesus, you're healed." And he said, "But now I [music] I need you to do something for me." &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to lay your hand on the sister sitting next to you. She's suffering the same thing." &gt;&gt; And when she laid her hand on her sister, Brother Bram said, "There it is." He said, "I see it now. Something white moving in, shoving that thing away." And you know, whether you can see it with your eyes or not, &gt;&gt; that's [music] exactly what happens when the word of God begins to be ministered over a congregation, the spirit of God gets behind that old oppressive thing &gt;&gt; and just begins to push it right out of your mind and right out of your life. Amen. And and you could say, "I see it. There it goes. There it goes." &gt;&gt; You know, when you get tired of getting pushed around, it's time to push back. You say, "How do I push back tonight?" Brother Wayne, you worship God. &gt;&gt; You just begin to let his Holy Spirit move into that being and something wonderful begins to happen. I'll tell you friends, what a tremendous beginning to a meeting tonight. Amen. I I I so appreciated the the word of God. Inspiration is real, folks. &gt;&gt; Amen. Inspiration's real. Brother Ronnie and I sit and talked about some of these very things just before the meeting tonight. and the Holy Spirit just it's so real &gt;&gt; that that spirit of God can just come right in the building. Uh brother Jonathan and I sat and talked just yesterday about a couple of these issues and and praying and asking God, we need the certain thing. And if the Holy Spirit didn't pick up our conversation and begin to deal directly with the situations and how that he can handle it, there is no problem too big for our God. &gt;&gt; There is no sickness he cannot heal. &gt;&gt; There's no trouble he cannot dissipate. There's no darkness that his sunlight cannot move back off of you. Amen. He He's a merciful God tonight. And we're we're so thankful for him and what he's done for us. Amen. I I certainly believe that tonight. Amen. I I certainly believe his mercy and his and his truth is real. We want to thank each of you for coming out tonight. We begin tomorrow night again at 6:00.
