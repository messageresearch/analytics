[42:56] Molly they're going to be dedicating Co
[43:00] Cyrus uh
[43:02] boo I was uh just looking a little bit
[43:05] this morning or yesterday uh looking
[43:08] into the name of the baby and I thought
[43:10] it was so tremendous Amy man maybe just
[43:12] give me this M for
[43:16] now can't teach an old dog new tricks
[43:18] sorry amen um tell me it don't sound
[43:22] better brother
[43:23] Howard so
[43:25] um uh
[43:27] I was looking into this and uh the name
[43:29] cole actually means Victory um and I I
[43:34] thought wow that that's tremendous but
[43:35] the middle name of this baby uh Cyrus is
[43:39] a one of my old testament uh favorites
[43:42] he's a Persian king and he was one that
[43:45] led the Army uh that overthrew Babylon
[43:47] that released the children of Israel and
[43:50] um all the way in Isaiah
[43:52] 45 uh Isaiah was prophesying of him and
[43:55] calling the anointing
[43:57] and he was calling him Sirus Cyrus whose
[44:00] name have I Holden and even before he
[44:04] was born God was telling that he would
[44:06] make crooked places straight and that he
[44:08] would cut bars of iron
[44:10] asunder and uh one of the most beautiful
[44:13] Parts is is he said for Jacob my
[44:16] servant's sake and Israel mine elect he
[44:18] said I've called thee by name I have
[44:21] surnamed thee though thou Hast not known
[44:24] me and I am the Lord and there is none
[44:28] else there is no God beside me I GED
[44:31] thee that thou Hast not known me and God
[44:35] God named this Persian king hundreds of
[44:38] years before he was ever used and I was
[44:40] always amazed that when Babylon fell
[44:43] that this king would have rode into town
[44:44] somebody had ask him what your name is
[44:47] they'd have took the Scrolls out and
[44:48] they said yeah here he is in Prophecy
[44:50] right here that God knew his name a long
[44:52] time before he did and you know brother
[44:54] brandham actually told us that God knew
[44:57] these babies before the foundation of
[44:59] the world Amen and we're so thankful
[45:02] today Amen to be able to dedicate them

[48:02] honor this morning of course to be able
[48:05] to uh say that brother Donnie Reagan and
[48:08] sister Carol Reagan are with us amen
[48:10] it's a it was a great honor I I didn't
[48:13] say much about it in the Youth Camp of
[48:15] course but um brother uh brother Donnie
[48:17] and I had spoke a little bit In the Heat
[48:20] of what Bethany was going through um she
[48:22] was having some pretty severe um effects
[48:26] of
[48:27] kind of like a a non-epileptic seizure
[48:30] and she was having some very very strong
[48:32] seizures and I would speak to brother R
[48:34] brother Donnie and and ask him if he had
[48:37] some time to come and pray for her and U
[48:39] he said brother Wayne I don't have time
[48:41] he said but I'm going to make time and
[48:44] so we certainly appreciate this man of
[48:46] God just dropping what he was doing and
[48:49] making a moment to come and amen I know
[48:52] the Holy Spirit was moved so powerfully
[48:54] yesterday and and we're so thankful for
[48:57] them to come amen and it's such a
[48:59] blessing you know uh when God sends a
[49:02] man of God among you you all know amen
[49:05] that we're about to hear from Heaven
[49:07] amen we're about to hear from Heaven uh
[49:10] you know the prophet said this he said
[49:12] the greatest and highest form there is
[49:14] for God to give a message to his people
[49:17] is to believe the word and that's the
[49:19] highest form preaching is the highest
[49:23] form and when a minister walks into this
[49:26] congregation
[49:27] and the people are praying and the
[49:29] anointing of the spirit he said you are
[49:31] bound to hear from Heaven amen how many
[49:34] you'd like to hear from Heaven this
[49:35] morning do you know God chose men to do
[49:38] that he didn't choose the stars or the
[49:40] Suns and it would be more advantageous
[49:42] if he did because they would be without
[49:44] failures without the human Veil but God
[49:47] chose men to preach the gospel and
[49:49] brother Bram went so far to say that he
[49:51] chose man to preach and that's where his
[49:54] voice will come from he went on to say
[49:57] that this is a man is a transmitter of
[50:00] the voice of God and that's the agency
[50:03] he
[50:04] chooses that's why all the preaching and
[50:07] the teaching that happens brother Bram
[50:08] says so the sheep can hear the voice of
[50:12] God and follow him this is a channel God
[50:16] consecrates a channel to speak to a
[50:19] congregation he'll use a channel you use
[50:21] a man and brother brand actually says
[50:23] this is the apostolic way of holding a
[50:26] meeting is to preach the gospel and the
[50:29] people that believe that are touched and
[50:31] healed and moved upon and this morning
[50:33] we we want to take a few moments here as
[50:35] we invite our brother we want to ask the
[50:37] Lord just to use him in a mighty way
[50:40] amen we all respect brother Donnie's
[50:42] he's been a committed channel to this
[50:44] message for years and years but we what
[50:46] we really want to do is activate the
[50:48] gift of God you know some said I have a
[50:51] need this morning but brother Donnie
[50:52] didn't hear my need but you know there's
[50:55] the Bible said that the word of God God
[50:56] is a discerner of the thought and the
[50:59] intent of the heart and he might not
[51:01] personally know but that gift in him
[51:03] does and the word of God can cross right
[51:06] across your path and when it does don't
[51:09] you Hold Your amen you reach out and say
[51:11] Lord thank you for that thank you for
[51:14] touching my life I appreciate you
[51:16] speaking to me amen we need to hear God
[51:19] speak those Supernatural words that
[51:21] changes our existence in our life won
[51:23] you stand with us this morning as we
[51:25] welcome brother Donnie to come

[54:16] that
[54:17] day with the saints of God that have
[54:20] lived down Through the
[54:21] Ages and we all begin to sing those
[54:24] songs of redemption
[54:27] the prophet tells us that actually
[54:29] whenever that
[54:30] happens that the angels will encircle
[54:34] the
[54:35] Earth and they will have to bow their
[54:38] heads because they don't understand
[54:42] that Peter said it was so great that it
[54:46] was something that the angels of God
[54:49] desired to look into and that word means
[54:53] to stoop down and to look in
[54:58] intently they look at you every
[55:01] day and they Ponder and wonder about the
[55:04] Holy Ghost in you and how God leads your
[55:07] life and molds you and shapes you can
[55:10] you imagine we are the
[55:12] Marvel of
[55:15] angels amen God bless you so nice to be
[55:18] with you
[55:19] today I've preached in a lot of
[55:21] different places all over the world but
[55:25] for my own feeling um this has always
[55:29] been one of my favorite places to come
[55:31] and preach up in this part of the
[55:33] country been friends with brother
[55:36] Ericson and his family for many many
[55:38] years and then brother Wayne as well and
[55:41] just so happy to see what God is doing
[55:44] doing in your midst can we just bow our
[55:46] heads together and
[55:48] [Music]
[55:50] pray Lord Jesus we
[55:53] can't speak about that great day without
[55:56] about it moving our
[55:58] hearts thinking about what a time it's
[56:01] going to
[56:02] be when there'll be no more sorrow no
[56:05] more sickness no more pain no more
[56:10] suffering father until that time we need
[56:12] your strength to help us each
[56:15] day you know the needs of all these
[56:18] people that are represented here today
[56:20] Father and only you could custom fit a
[56:23] sermon that would' be able to meet the
[56:25] needs of every one of them I pray that
[56:29] you'd shut my mouth to anything that
[56:31] would displease
[56:32] you make me sensitive Lord that I could
[56:36] follow you if if someone would have a
[56:39] need and maybe it would feel to me I'm
[56:42] going out of lines or off the topic Lord
[56:47] God sometimes it only takes a word or
[56:49] two or three and their life can be
[56:53] changed so help me to be sensitive to
[56:56] you
[56:57] father we thank you for the opportunity
[57:00] once again to stand before your people
[57:02] ask your blessings on the assembly here
[57:04] the pastor the deacons trustees all the
[57:07] board Lord the leoty bless them Father
[57:10] keep them for this hour we pray in Jesus
[57:14] name
[57:19] amen God bless you I'm still a
[57:24] baby you see have not been saved that
[57:27] long uh Carolyn I turned 68 a few weeks
[57:32] ago and I gave my heart to the Lord
[57:34] whenever I was 12 so I've not been saved
[57:37] that long
[57:38] really I started preaching whenever I
[57:41] was 18 so I've been preaching 50 years
[57:43] now I ain't really been preaching that
[57:45] long
[57:46] either now I say all that so that
[57:48] whenever I make mistakes you'll
[57:50] understand I'm just a kid in
[57:54] reality it's something about preaching
[57:56] you know that you realize I preached
[57:59] thousands of sermons around the world
[58:01] brother Wayne has brother Ericson has
[58:04] and neither one of us have ever preached
[58:05] a perfect
[58:06] one because it's the human
[58:09] element but I always Marvel that God
[58:11] could take something so frail as as
[58:14] humans and be able to speak to
[58:18] others and one day we'll look around and
[58:20] we'll see them there in eternity won't
[58:23] that be an awesome time
[58:26] I'd also like to say my wife Carol's
[58:28] with me today and we want to thank you
[58:30] for praying for our our daughter Erica I
[58:33] know that y'all did many many times and
[58:35] we're so grateful for that we thank you
[58:38] for praying for us after the Lord and
[58:40] his wisdom he it was his plan to take
[58:43] her home and um we thank you for
[58:46] remembering us we're still dealing with
[58:48] all that of course Erica left behind her
[58:51] husband and two sets of twin girls they
[58:54] were up here for the Youth Camp that
[58:56] y'all just had and U we certainly
[58:59] appreciate your continued praise for
[59:01] that and if anybody tells you that she's
[59:04] dead you tell them that ain't the truth
[59:07] she's very alive
[59:09] today amen let's turn to the Song of
[59:13] Solomon if you would this
[59:16] morning chapter 3 verse
[59:24] 6 song Solomon 3: 6 I don't know if
[59:29] you're aware of this or not but the Song
[59:32] of Solomon by the Hebrews is called the
[59:37] holy of
[59:38] holies and they actually will not let
[59:41] their children read The Song of Solomon
[59:44] until they become
[59:45] adults because it can seem to be very
[59:50] intimate and very open and forward but
[59:54] we believe that there's spiritual truth
[59:57] that lays in God's word aren't we glad
[59:59] for that where a person could read the
[1:00:02] Bible every day of their life and no
[1:00:04] doubt there's theologians in the world
[1:00:06] that know the Bible probably better than
[1:00:09] we do U as far as that sort of thinking
[1:00:12] but our main focus is we know the author
[1:00:16] will well so that gives us a special
[1:00:20] understanding let's read together down
[1:00:22] to um verse n if you would Song of
[1:00:25] Solomon chapter 3 verse
[1:00:27] 6 who is this that cometh out of the
[1:00:30] Wilderness like pillars of
[1:00:34] smoke perfumed with myrr and
[1:00:40] frankincense was all powders of the
[1:00:44] merchant behold his bed which is
[1:00:48] Solomon's three score Valiant men are
[1:00:51] about it of the Valiant of Israel
[1:00:57] they all hold
[1:00:59] swords being
[1:01:01] expert in
[1:01:04] war every man hath his
[1:01:07] sword upon his thigh now listen to
[1:01:11] reason why because of fear in the
[1:01:17] night King Solomon made himself a
[1:01:22] chariot of the wood of of
[1:01:27] Lebanon may the Lord bless his words you
[1:01:30] may be
[1:01:35] seated I'd like to speak to you for a
[1:01:37] while this morning on bring her
[1:01:41] home
[1:01:44] safely bring her
[1:01:46] home
[1:01:50] safely we are told
[1:01:53] that Solomon was out
[1:01:56] when he became
[1:01:58] king taking a
[1:02:01] tour of this land of
[1:02:05] Israel he begins of course in
[1:02:09] Jerusalem and goes to the north it goes
[1:02:12] to the East toward the
[1:02:14] Mediterranean goes to the West toward
[1:02:17] the Great River and South toward
[1:02:20] Egypt remember this man was granted
[1:02:24] wisdom like no other the man on the
[1:02:26] earth had ever been given but he had
[1:02:29] also been given a charge to build a
[1:02:31] house for God but it also been given a
[1:02:35] special name by God
[1:02:38] himself now Solomon of course we know
[1:02:41] was born between David and bath Sheba
[1:02:44] and he was given quite a charge even by
[1:02:48] his father his father could not build
[1:02:50] the temple of God because he had blood
[1:02:52] on his hands but David was called to get
[1:02:55] gather all the material together so much
[1:02:59] of the material before his passing David
[1:03:02] had gathered so that the house of God
[1:03:04] could be built and he was many years in
[1:03:06] building the house of God and then also
[1:03:10] his own house but we know that Solomon
[1:03:14] being a king he had many marriages and
[1:03:18] those marriages many times were not
[1:03:20] based on love but they were based on
[1:03:24] politics so if he needed an alliance
[1:03:28] with the king from Lebanon he might
[1:03:30] Marry The King's Daughter if he needed
[1:03:33] an alliance from another country where
[1:03:35] they had the gold of oor as it's called
[1:03:39] or if they needed Cedars from Lebanon
[1:03:42] then they would make a marriage and that
[1:03:45] marriage stood as an alliance so it was
[1:03:48] a political stronghold in the Kingdom
[1:03:52] but then we realize that in the song of
[1:03:56] that it was a marriage about another
[1:04:00] woman it was not a political union it
[1:04:03] was not one that would benefit him
[1:04:06] politically as a matter of fact it was
[1:04:08] it would be identified through the
[1:04:11] people of that day as a marriage of
[1:04:15] humility because he's out riding in his
[1:04:19] Chariot and his great men were with him
[1:04:23] beside him watching over him of course
[1:04:25] his
[1:04:26] bodyguards and
[1:04:29] he happened to see
[1:04:33] her she was
[1:04:36] dark but comely to the women of that day
[1:04:41] to be dark skinned meant you were out in
[1:04:44] the sun so the the fair women the
[1:04:48] lighter skinned women they were the ones
[1:04:50] that a lot of Kings would want it was a
[1:04:53] sign they didn't have to tall in the
[1:04:56] fields and tend the flocks and the
[1:05:00] Sheep but when he saw
[1:05:03] her his heart was smitten with
[1:05:06] her but she was a poor
[1:05:10] girl and didn't have much that she could
[1:05:14] be able to give
[1:05:16] him so when Solomon saw her and was
[1:05:21] Smitten by her in so much that as we
[1:05:24] read in the song of Solomon he says turn
[1:05:27] your eyes away from
[1:05:30] me for one of your
[1:05:33] eyes one of your
[1:05:35] eyes has taken me and that word taken is
[1:05:39] to be held a
[1:05:43] captive when we look at ourselves this
[1:05:45] morning and realize that in number we
[1:05:48] are very
[1:05:49] small in comparison to the world
[1:05:53] comparison to the World Church
[1:05:56] but you see there's something about his
[1:05:59] elect
[1:06:00] lady that caught his
[1:06:04] attention and she actually did it before
[1:06:06] the foundation of the
[1:06:10] world
[1:06:11] Solomon had been given great wisdom as
[1:06:14] far as building and being able to devise
[1:06:18] and he was u a a Creator an artisan also
[1:06:23] Specialties in wood and in metals and
[1:06:27] things like that so the verse seven here
[1:06:30] says that behold his bed which is
[1:06:35] Solomon's three score Valiant men are
[1:06:38] about it now this bed is not what you
[1:06:41] would think it was not so much a place
[1:06:42] to sleep but the Hebrew word there is
[1:06:47] metall so it was a couch or a buyer or
[1:06:53] it was a also called a litter so it
[1:06:57] comes from the word to stretch out so it
[1:07:01] would have been for a one individual
[1:07:05] only and he builds this this is his
[1:07:09] transport his means they didn't have
[1:07:11] Tesla or Chevrolet or Ford or any of
[1:07:13] that in that day so it would have been
[1:07:16] his bodyguards and they would have
[1:07:19] carried him from one place to another so
[1:07:23] it just so happens that he
[1:07:26] on his
[1:07:27] metall in the Indians the East Indians
[1:07:31] it would have been called a
[1:07:33] Peloquin so on this Peloquin there would
[1:07:37] have been several different types of
[1:07:40] material that would have been used to
[1:07:42] build it there would have been several
[1:07:45] colors that would have reflected what
[1:07:48] the king saw so he was quite an artisan
[1:07:50] himself so he actually builds this
[1:07:54] himself so behold his bed which is
[1:07:56] Solomon's three score Valiant men are
[1:07:58] about it the Valiant of Israel so it
[1:08:01] being a matal a l of pacquin it was a
[1:08:05] covered couch and it had little tiny
[1:08:09] columns which would have been fluted and
[1:08:12] it had all these beautiful colors that
[1:08:16] would have been on it so the idea is
[1:08:20] that it is a comfortable means of
[1:08:22] Transport for the king to be out while
[1:08:26] he's surveying his kingdom no doubt he
[1:08:29] got weary and tired of of of so much
[1:08:32] building and so much improvising and so
[1:08:35] much things that he had to do being King
[1:08:39] I'm sure it was a difficult job and one
[1:08:42] way that he would want to do it was that
[1:08:44] he loved nature and he loved Gardens so
[1:08:47] whenever he would be out and about and
[1:08:51] I've been in in Israel maybe many of you
[1:08:53] have as well and on some of the places
[1:08:56] it's it's very Barren hardly any trees
[1:09:00] hardly any plants at all and there was
[1:09:03] other parts the Galilee and the northern
[1:09:05] part uh very beautiful trees grass so he
[1:09:09] would take this journey and take a few
[1:09:12] days off is would say to go to the
[1:09:16] mountains of course in the north part is
[1:09:18] Mount Hermon action they get snow there
[1:09:21] because of the elevation so it would
[1:09:23] have been quite a reprieve from the land
[1:09:26] where he was at and where his labor and
[1:09:29] all of his thoughts was totally consumed
[1:09:32] so let's just say that it must have been
[1:09:34] on one of
[1:09:36] those
[1:09:42] trips that he saw
[1:09:47] her and when he
[1:09:50] did now remember he was used to having
[1:09:54] Queens
[1:09:56] in his
[1:09:58] court every day it was the princes of
[1:10:01] the known
[1:10:02] civilization the monarchs the
[1:10:05] ambassadors of
[1:10:08] Kingdoms he was used to being catered to
[1:10:12] used to being all Royal Highness your
[1:10:19] majesty and maybe she was out in the
[1:10:21] field tending the Sheep
[1:10:26] trestles of hair hanging down her back
[1:10:29] and it was hot maybe that day and she
[1:10:33] reached up to wipe the her face and
[1:10:35] remove the
[1:10:37] sweat but there was an all about her a
[1:10:42] beauty that when he saw
[1:10:45] her it put a mark on
[1:10:48] him that he would never get over
[1:10:55] so
[1:10:56] she realizes who this is
[1:11:00] and he tells his men to take him over to
[1:11:03] where she's
[1:11:06] at she's probably never even been in the
[1:11:09] presence of a king
[1:11:12] before all she knew was common
[1:11:15] folk Farmers ranchers sheep
[1:11:20] herders people like
[1:11:22] that but could you imagine whenever the
[1:11:26] the
[1:11:27] men they watch his mannerisms and they
[1:11:29] know it's time to stop the
[1:11:32] Peloquin so he bids them to
[1:11:35] Halt and he steps down now they're going
[1:11:38] to lower it down so that he can be able
[1:11:41] to step
[1:11:43] out and her heart starts
[1:11:47] racing her face
[1:11:50] flushing cuz her clothes she looks so
[1:11:53] pitiful
[1:11:56] and by now she is she is so nervous and
[1:12:00] so
[1:12:02] anxious but he comes up to her and said
[1:12:05] how are you she say my
[1:12:09] king my great
[1:12:12] king she's ashamed to look at
[1:12:16] him she don't know how to talk to
[1:12:19] again kind of reminds me of our
[1:12:22] Prophet before he got saved that he
[1:12:26] wanted to get right with God but he
[1:12:28] didn't know
[1:12:30] how so he wrote God a
[1:12:35] letter and put it out on a
[1:12:39] tree that might have been some of you
[1:12:43] some of
[1:12:44] us I wasn't raised in church and I
[1:12:47] didn't know how to get
[1:12:48] saved so before I went to my uncle's
[1:12:51] church and give my heart to God I had
[1:12:54] asked my mom
[1:12:57] mama how do you get
[1:13:00] saved she had just given her heart to
[1:13:03] the Lord a couple of weeks before that
[1:13:04] and I saw a change in
[1:13:06] her but I'd never talked to him
[1:13:09] before my wife sitting here
[1:13:12] today was 16 years old before she ever
[1:13:16] heard the story of Daniel and the Lions
[1:13:20] did she had never heard the story of
[1:13:24] Noah in the
[1:13:26] ark you see how fortunate some of you
[1:13:29] young people are to be raised in a
[1:13:31] message Church you cut your teeth on
[1:13:34] message
[1:13:35] pews but if you're here today a heathen
[1:13:39] from one Heathen to another don't worry
[1:13:41] there's Hope For
[1:13:43] You
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:52] Hallelujah so there must have been an
[1:13:55] agreement
[1:13:57] made and he tells
[1:14:00] her I'll send my Chariot back for
[1:14:04] you at the appointed
[1:14:08] time so we'll move we'll move up in in
[1:14:12] time
[1:14:16] now Solomon sends her
[1:14:22] word she still can't believe that it's
[1:14:27] true she's going to be
[1:14:30] married to the
[1:14:33] king now we don't know her Hebrew
[1:14:38] name but what we know that she's a
[1:14:40] dentified by is
[1:14:46] shulamite now I find this very
[1:14:48] interesting that the word
[1:14:50] shulamite is the feminist form
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:59] Solomon somebody ought to be shouting
[1:15:01] about right
[1:15:02] [Laughter]
[1:15:05] now so he
[1:15:08] renames
[1:15:10] her and gives her the feminist form of
[1:15:14] his name you see it wasn't just by
[1:15:17] chance that you happened to be here
[1:15:20] today it wasn't just by Chance the day
[1:15:23] the night the morning that you gave your
[1:15:25] heart to God and maybe you had no plans
[1:15:28] on even going to church but God had
[1:15:30] plans on you
[1:15:33] going our life friends is in his hands
[1:15:37] and you may be going through some of the
[1:15:39] greatest trials you've ever been through
[1:15:41] in your life today but let me remind you
[1:15:44] almighty God knows your name he knows
[1:15:47] your address he knows what you're going
[1:15:49] through and you let that devil know he
[1:15:52] has not forgotten you
[1:15:55] you may be praying and you don't feel
[1:15:57] him you may be going to church and it
[1:15:59] doesn't seem like it does you any good
[1:16:02] but he knows who you are he knows what
[1:16:06] you're going through he has not
[1:16:08] forgotten
[1:16:13] you so according to their custom and the
[1:16:18] protocol of this
[1:16:20] time it would have been Unbecoming
[1:16:25] to a Middle East Eastern King to have
[1:16:29] actually went
[1:16:31] down and got
[1:16:33] her and brought her back
[1:16:36] home and remember my title bring her
[1:16:41] safely
[1:16:43] home so when we pick up on the Song of
[1:16:46] Solomon in this chapter actually what's
[1:16:48] going
[1:16:48] on is that Solomon is sending men
[1:16:55] Amen to bring the shulamite
[1:16:59] home I'd like to speak to every godall
[1:17:03] preacher in this building
[1:17:05] today and say Brothers I'm the very
[1:17:07] least to tell you but we have been given
[1:17:10] one of the greatest
[1:17:12] charges that any mortal could ever be
[1:17:16] given to bring God's
[1:17:19] bride safely
[1:17:22] home it's not about me it's not about
[1:17:25] any other preacher how great we can
[1:17:27] preach how big our ministry is it's not
[1:17:30] about
[1:17:31] that it's about trying to find her
[1:17:35] trying to encourage her trying to get
[1:17:37] her saved if she ain't saved trying to
[1:17:39] get her filled with the Holy Ghost if
[1:17:40] she don't have the Holy
[1:17:43] Ghost trying to preach the word to her
[1:17:46] that'll help her grow and become what
[1:17:48] God wants her to be we are facing the
[1:17:51] greatest challenge of any generation
[1:17:53] that's ever lived on the the face of the
[1:17:55] Earth what is that the body
[1:17:58] change can you imagine we are looking
[1:18:01] for something and expecting it are we
[1:18:03] not the greatest event after the
[1:18:06] resurrection of our Lord Jesus that has
[1:18:09] ever hit the earth in a moment and a
[1:18:11] twinkling of an eye thousands or
[1:18:14] hundreds of thousands or how many ever
[1:18:16] that it will be that the power of God
[1:18:19] will sweep over the Earth and we shall
[1:18:23] be changed
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:27] oh
[1:18:33] Hallelujah now I'm trying to be nice and
[1:18:36] behave myself till at least I get the
[1:18:38] foundation laid and then after that I'm
[1:18:41] not responsible for my
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:48] actions so
[1:18:51] Solomon tells these men
[1:18:55] I want you to take my
[1:18:58] personal
[1:19:02] Peloquin and go bring her
[1:19:05] back you see we are
[1:19:09] not we are not just church
[1:19:12] members and don't misunderstand me when
[1:19:15] I say it this way we're not just
[1:19:17] following a prophet and we're not just
[1:19:20] people say well I I believe the message
[1:19:22] all kinds of people will believe the
[1:19:23] message that will not be there
[1:19:25] every devil in hell believes God sent a
[1:19:28] prophet he whooped the tar out of them
[1:19:31] they ought to
[1:19:32] know amen ain't that right he'll talk
[1:19:36] these people into leaving the message
[1:19:38] but the devil knows better that's
[1:19:40] exactly right amen you can imagine now
[1:19:44] that they make the
[1:19:46] agreement and a betroll the one it was
[1:19:49] made in in among the Jews it lasted
[1:19:52] anywhere from 9 months to a year to make
[1:19:54] sure sure she was not with seed of
[1:19:56] another man when a boy was born they
[1:19:58] would plant a tree in memory of him when
[1:20:00] a girl was born they'd plant a tree in
[1:20:02] memory of her then they would grow and
[1:20:05] grow those trees would when they would
[1:20:07] get old enough to become at the marriage
[1:20:09] age they would cut that tree down his
[1:20:12] tree and her tree and then they would
[1:20:15] make four posts out of those trees and
[1:20:19] they would stretch a canopy over that
[1:20:22] over that so they could the bride and
[1:20:24] the groom could walk in and they would
[1:20:27] finish their vows they would actually
[1:20:29] enter into an betral and they would
[1:20:32] signed it both of them signed it they
[1:20:34] would take a cup of wine and drink that
[1:20:36] wine and they were bound and they would
[1:20:39] wait until Matthew chapter 25 if you
[1:20:43] know the marriage ceremony the Kingdom
[1:20:45] of Heaven shall be likened under 10
[1:20:47] virgins five were wives fire were
[1:20:48] foolish and then we know that story and
[1:20:51] whenever he's giving us the exact thing
[1:20:53] of what it would be so the bridegroom
[1:20:55] would send a messenger to the bride's
[1:20:58] house she didn't even know what day it
[1:21:00] was but he'd tell her be ready in this
[1:21:03] certain week so he would send a
[1:21:06] messenger a prophet would call it he
[1:21:09] would send a messenger to let her know
[1:21:11] today is the day get ready so you know
[1:21:14] what the bride would be ready the
[1:21:15] bridegroom would send a message and go
[1:21:18] get her and bring her back where to his
[1:21:21] house take her from her house to to his
[1:21:25] house now you realize that the devil is
[1:21:27] going to do everything he can after we
[1:21:30] believe the revealed word of this hour
[1:21:32] to get us to question it to get us so
[1:21:35] busy with the things of life that we get
[1:21:38] so busy not horrible sinful things just
[1:21:41] so busy with life itself how many knows
[1:21:45] that the truth we've only got 24 hours
[1:21:48] in the day and yet it seems like there's
[1:21:49] more things to occupy our time than
[1:21:52] probably any generation that has ever
[1:21:54] been on the Earth but I want to let the
[1:21:57] devil know and I want to let hell know
[1:22:00] he's not going to stop this bride from
[1:22:02] being ready because there's something
[1:22:04] inside of us that's been gerti by the
[1:22:08] spirit of God it will not hinder the
[1:22:12] bride of
[1:22:16] Christ so Solomon
[1:22:19] sends his own means of transport
[1:22:26] this is the people that's going to leave
[1:22:28] this world in the Rapture you got to be
[1:22:32] riding the same
[1:22:35] power that Jesus
[1:22:39] wrote it ain't enough to say I go to
[1:22:42] church I believe this I believe that you
[1:22:45] got to have power to get out of here how
[1:22:48] did he come to the Earth by his own life
[1:22:52] his own power remember Rebecca whenever
[1:22:55] Rebecca went down unwatered the camels
[1:22:57] oh my and one of them camels could drink
[1:23:00] multiple gallons of water at one time I
[1:23:03] I calculated him in a while back it was
[1:23:05] unbelievable the trips that she had to
[1:23:08] go back and forth back and forth giving
[1:23:11] praise or water to that Camel that's
[1:23:14] right the prophet said ler did she know
[1:23:17] that very camel that she was watering
[1:23:20] was the same one that was going to pack
[1:23:22] her to her bridegroom
[1:23:25] you see God wants us to praise him and
[1:23:28] he don't want us just to do it in church
[1:23:30] he wants you to do it on the job he
[1:23:32] wants you to do it when you're driving
[1:23:34] down the road when you're going to
[1:23:36] school he loves to be praised if you
[1:23:38] could only realize today one of these
[1:23:41] days that same holy ghost that we're
[1:23:43] giving praise to is going to send a
[1:23:46] sweep over our bodies and we're going to
[1:23:48] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:23:52] an eye oh Hallelujah it makes me want to
[1:23:55] praise him it makes me want to worship
[1:23:58] him and bless his name because I'm going
[1:24:01] to be riding the same
[1:24:05] power that Jesus
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:12] wrote so the king sends his own
[1:24:16] means of
[1:24:19] transportation so how did Jesus rais
[1:24:22] from the dead
[1:24:25] the Holy
[1:24:26] Ghost how did Jesus rise up on the mount
[1:24:31] and be
[1:24:33] changed Jesus had a body
[1:24:36] change remember whenever they laid that
[1:24:39] body in the
[1:24:41] Tomb raising him from the dead was not
[1:24:45] enough right cuz remember the prophet
[1:24:47] said he looked like he was about 50
[1:24:50] years old so you understand you
[1:24:55] understand the Lord Jesus also had to
[1:24:57] have a body change because he does not
[1:25:00] look like a 50 year old man now that's
[1:25:04] he had scars he had this and that and
[1:25:07] the other so oh Hallelujah he had to
[1:25:10] experience a body change that not only
[1:25:14] would raise him from the dead but would
[1:25:17] remove him his human aging and the scars
[1:25:20] that was placed there by bearing our lo
[1:25:23] oh I wish some somebody would preach
[1:25:25] with me this morning the Lord Jesus
[1:25:27] experienced a body change and what was
[1:25:30] it that changed it the power of God and
[1:25:34] the same power of God one of these days
[1:25:37] hallelujah in a moment in the twinkling
[1:25:39] of an ey will Sweep All Over the Earth
[1:25:43] and every child of God that has the
[1:25:46] token every child of God that has the
[1:25:49] true baptism of the Holy Ghost will move
[1:25:53] into the power Quin of the Lord
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:01] Jesus I love emotion but emotion ain't
[1:26:04] enough I love shouting but shouting
[1:26:07] ain't enough even Miracles ain't enough
[1:26:11] we've got to have the personal
[1:26:15] life Oh Glory to God glory to
[1:26:22] God so theing
[1:26:25] King sends his own means of
[1:26:30] Transport so it is his will then that
[1:26:33] his chosen would be with him where he
[1:26:36] is now it's actually a several day
[1:26:40] Journey from where she lives to where
[1:26:43] Jerusalem
[1:26:46] was now I want you to
[1:26:49] notice who he sends to bring her back
[1:26:53] home
[1:26:55] it was not MP3 players right it was not
[1:26:58] tap
[1:26:59] players that's right come
[1:27:03] [Applause]

[1:27:12] I believe in listening to the message of
[1:27:14] the hour and I believe in pressing play
[1:27:17] but when I press play I hear quotes like
[1:27:21] this you know I see myself here as an
[1:27:23] old man he said I see my end out yonder
[1:27:25] and he said I know that these young men
[1:27:27] will take this message and sweep it on
[1:27:30] to the coming of the Lord
[1:27:32] Jesus also hear him say what we need in
[1:27:35] this hour is Men Of God filled with the
[1:27:37] Holy Ghost that'll get in the pull pit
[1:27:39] and preach the
[1:27:41] word come on somebody now when I was a
[1:27:44] young man I fulfilled that other quote
[1:27:46] but I'm still fulfilling this one I'm
[1:27:48] still preaching ain't a young man no
[1:27:50] longer I'm an old man but I'm looking
[1:27:52] any day to be changed back to a young
[1:27:55] man praise the Lord how is it going to
[1:27:57] be the same power of God that raised our
[1:28:01] lord Jesus from the dead the same power
[1:28:04] of God that come over that human body
[1:28:07] and change him from a 50-year looking
[1:28:09] old man to a young man the King of Kings
[1:28:12] the Lord of
[1:28:16] lords
[1:28:18] Hallelujah so the
[1:28:20] couch of
[1:28:22] Solomon will bear the the
[1:28:25] bride to
[1:28:27] Jerusalem the
[1:28:30] cross of our Lord Jesus the power of the
[1:28:35] Cross will carry you over let me tell
[1:28:38] you we don't just stop at the
[1:28:41] cross come on now we believe in the
[1:28:44] cross thank God for the cross but
[1:28:47] preaching the cross alone is not
[1:28:50] enough well come on somebody them 12
[1:28:53] Apostles they believed in the cross and
[1:28:55] they preached the cross but they did not
[1:28:57] stop at the cross but they preached what
[1:29:01] the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:04] Ghost oh what a thing it must have
[1:29:08] been when those men show up at her
[1:29:12] door and she looks out there and there
[1:29:16] is some of the greatest men of the
[1:29:19] Kingdom 60 of them that

[1:29:46] ha and tote and fetch and bat now I know
[1:29:48] you Northerners bless your heart you all
[1:29:50] don't talk like that but
[1:29:58] can you imagine how difficult it must
[1:30:00] have been for
[1:30:01] her to start talking the king's
[1:30:08] language you see some of us are still
[1:30:10] talking
[1:30:12] slave
[1:30:14] language I'm not worthy I'm not good
[1:30:16] enough I can never be good enough why
[1:30:18] would God love me I've I've made so many
[1:30:20] mistakes I've fallen so short of the
[1:30:22] glory of God come on somebody

[1:30:27] not be you're not good enough you're not
[1:30:29] rich enough you're ugly you're whatever
[1:30:32] more your confession should be not what
[1:30:34] you are in the flesh but what he has
[1:30:37] done for you that's right the human part
[1:30:41] I'm not worthy but he made me worthy he
[1:30:44] offered you Grace he offered you Mercy
[1:30:47] he offered you forgiveness but I made so
[1:30:50] many mistakes so have I but he offers me
[1:30:54] pardon for my mistakes and I'm going to

[1:31:14] from this area where she was
[1:31:18] from going to be called to the
[1:31:20] court of the
[1:31:22] king and his
[1:31:25] magnificence I found it amazing when you
[1:31:27] look at the number here that there was
[1:31:29] actually 60
[1:31:31] Warriors that would come to get
[1:31:34] her and there was
[1:31:38] 600,000 that
[1:31:40] encamped about the
[1:31:44] ark protecting the way to
[1:31:48] life and what does Solomon do you

[1:32:11] sword is no oh he picking men Oh my he
[1:32:16] picked men that were valant the most
[1:32:19] Valiant in Israel now we know the Lord
[1:32:22] does not want us to make ey out of
[1:32:24] preachers but I thank God for every true
[1:32:27] God call man in this message that labors
[1:32:30] to bring the word what they go through
[1:32:33] what their families go through what
[1:32:35] their wives go through don't you how I
[1:32:38] appreciate them oh I want to be standing
[1:32:41] there that day when the Lord Jesus when
[1:32:43] we walk before him and the prophet of
[1:32:46] God stands there and presents the age
[1:32:48] and then it'll be broken down into you
[1:32:50] know the different churches and the
[1:32:52] different groups and the minist Min I
[1:32:54] want to be standing near when the men of
[1:32:56] God in this age that I have been
[1:32:58] privileged to preach with and preach for
[1:33:01] when they walk up there you're going to
[1:33:03] hear me you're going to hear me I
[1:33:04] guarantee you I'm going to be screaming

[1:33:22] brothers
[1:33:25] you brought
[1:33:26] her safely
[1:33:29] home I see what it cost you lonely
[1:33:37] nights as a preacher I can tell
[1:33:40] you the majority of my burdens in
[1:33:44] life have been because of God's
[1:33:48] people the majority of what I've went
[1:33:50] through for decades in my life all the
[1:33:53] takes us one phone call or a text and
[1:33:56] everything
[1:33:58] changes I got one of those last night
[1:34:00] and then I got one
[1:34:02] yesterday because your your heart is
[1:34:05] part of your people I'm talking about
[1:34:07] when you're a pastor even when you're an
[1:34:08] evangelist you may not know them
[1:34:10] individually but there's something God
[1:34:12] gives
[1:34:13] you you imagine he handpicked all these
[1:34:20] 60 behold his bed which is Solomon's
[1:34:23] three score Valiant men about it of the
[1:34:27] Valiant of
[1:34:29] Israel so it was common practice for the
[1:34:33] Grooms
[1:34:36] friends
[1:34:39] friends what an
[1:34:41] honor the groom's
[1:34:44] friends to go bring the bride
[1:34:48] back but they were also the most noble
[1:34:52] trustworthy
[1:34:54] this girl is a
[1:34:56] virgin they do not desire for her to
[1:34:59] bring forth their image that's right I
[1:35:04] hate to say it but let me just say it
[1:35:05] for a few minutes and then we'll go on
[1:35:07] we've had too many preachers around this
[1:35:09] message that have wanted to message
[1:35:12] people to be like them well come on
[1:35:15] somebody you don't want to be a
[1:35:16] reaganite you don't want to be a lonite
[1:35:19] you want to be a Christian son or
[1:35:21] daughter of God filled with the Holy
[1:35:23] Ghost is that right that's exactly what
[1:35:26] God wants and he's trusting his his
[1:35:29] wife's very
[1:35:33] virtue one
[1:35:35] woman with 60
[1:35:41] men one
[1:35:44] woman I tell you one thing I've met some
[1:35:46] men in this message I wouldn't want to
[1:35:48] be around my
[1:35:51] wife well praise the Lord Lord come on
[1:35:54] now don't sit there and look at me
[1:35:56] funny but you imagine Solomon scream
[1:36:00] these
[1:36:01] guys he knew them in battle he knew them
[1:36:05] as far as all that goes I remember this
[1:36:08] man was going to trust her protocol
[1:36:11] would not let his feet touch the
[1:36:18] Earth Hallelujah now I'm talking about
[1:36:20] the Lord Jesus right amen
[1:36:24] so he will not come in the Rapture and
[1:36:27] stand on this
[1:36:29] Earth but by ranks we will join together
[1:36:33] when the dead are raised and we'll start
[1:36:35] getting together and the prophet said
[1:36:37] all of a sudden a sweeper come over you
[1:36:41] you see the bride's used to
[1:36:43] sweeping she fulfills one of those
[1:36:46] Parables that Jesus gave whenever the
[1:36:48] bride had lost part of her coins in the
[1:36:51] tablet so the bride is used to sweeping
[1:36:54] so she got down on her knees and she's
[1:36:56] sweeping here and sweeping there
[1:36:58] Hallelujah you see people around the
[1:37:01] message who don't like sweeping won't be
[1:37:03] swept away but it's those that well

[1:37:09] sweep sweeping you ever lost a little
[1:37:12] bit of your joy and a little bit of your

[1:44:28] Hallelujah but let me say to you today
[1:44:30] little
[1:44:32] bride you not only
[1:44:34] have pastors evangelists and teachers
[1:44:37] and all
[1:44:38] that but you have other
[1:44:44] guards whenever Jacob had had his great
[1:44:46] Supernatural
[1:44:50] experience and he called the name of
[1:44:52] that place
[1:44:54] May
[1:44:55] anim May
[1:44:58] anim and the meaning is the place of two
[1:45:03] camps Jacob's camp and the Angelic
[1:45:08] Camp can you imagine after that
[1:45:11] experience that he goes and he makes an
[1:45:13] altar and he
[1:45:15] prays and he calls the name of that
[1:45:17] place
[1:45:19] L
[1:45:21] eloh is
[1:45:24] Israel L
[1:45:28] Elohim
[1:45:30] Israel what in the world got a hold to
[1:45:33] that
[1:45:34] man that he would name the altar of the
[1:45:38] merging together of God's name and his L
[1:45:42] elohi Israel God the god of Israel I'll
[1:45:47] tell you friends we've said it long
[1:45:49] enough where is the Lord God of Elijah
[1:45:53] we need to start saying where's my God
[1:45:56] where's your God where's your God
[1:45:58] where's your God oh God don't want us to
[1:46:01] live in history yes God moved for
[1:46:03] brother brandom thank God that he did
[1:46:05] and God moved for Paul but it's time
[1:46:07] that you and I realize he's not just the
[1:46:10] god of brother brandom he's not just the
[1:46:12] god of Elijah he is your god he is your
[1:46:15] here hallelujah he is your deliverer he
[1:46:19] is your salvation he is your king
[1:46:30] God did not send us for brother
[1:46:36] brandham God sent brother brandham for
[1:46:43] us there's three categories in Malachi
[1:46:46] 4:5 and a lot of folks leave out two of
[1:46:49] them but God anointed Malachi to say
[1:46:53] that behold I God send
[1:46:58] unto Elijah the prophet so God the
[1:47:02] people and Elijah must fil fulfill
[1:47:05] Malachi
[1:47:07] 4:5 I am the reason the seals needed to
[1:47:10] be opened I am the reason the Rapture
[1:47:13] message Hallelujah needed to be preached
[1:47:16] you are the reason of all the burdens
[1:47:19] that the prophet bore aren't you glad we
[1:47:21] had a prophet of God that was willing to
[1:47:24] stand up in this day in spite of all of
[1:47:26] the unbelief and all that was there and
[1:47:29] preach the word Why Oh my he was the one
[1:47:32] in charge of the Guard he was the one in
[1:47:35] charge of the Guard what's he going to
[1:47:37] do he's going to prepare by Revelation
[1:47:39] what the Guardsmen are going to need to
[1:47:42] feed the
[1:47:43] [Applause]
[1:47:47] bride notice this in Psalms
[1:47:50] 34:7 the angel of the Lord
[1:47:53] Lord encampeth round about them that
[1:47:56] fear Him and delivers him Matthew 18:10
[1:47:59] take heed that you despise not one of
[1:48:02] these little ones for I say unto you
[1:48:04] that In Heaven There Angels do behold
[1:48:06] the face of My Father which is in heaven
[1:48:10] and Jacob Genesis 32:1 went his way and
[1:48:12] the angels of God met him and when Jacob
[1:48:15] saw them he said this is God's host and
[1:48:19] he called the name of that place may I
[1:48:22] name him
[1:48:25] notice this in Song of Solomon again
[1:48:27] verse 7 behold his bed which is
[1:48:30] Solomon's three score Valiant men are
[1:48:33] about it of the Valiant of
[1:48:36] Israel but it speaks of a perilous
[1:48:41] Journey their swords are on their
[1:48:45] thighs which means it's hanging
[1:48:49] here and the Bible tells us why because
[1:48:53] of the
[1:48:54] night the
[1:48:57] darkness it's around us everywhere you
[1:48:59] know it
[1:49:01] yeah anybody here be honest with me
[1:49:04] today and say you've never had such a
[1:49:06] time in your
[1:49:07] life as far as hardships and troubles
[1:49:09] and difficulty look friends I'm I'm in
[1:49:11] contact with people around the world
[1:49:12] it's unbelievable the things that people
[1:49:14] are going through in the age we get in
[1:49:17] remember how it was years ago oh my you
[1:49:20] go through a a valley in a low place and
[1:49:22] you get up on the mountain top man aive
[1:49:25] that mountain top I mean it just seemed
[1:49:27] like it went on and on and on and then
[1:49:29] you go down to the valley woo there you
[1:49:32] was back up again on that mountain top
[1:49:34] oh you're just up there oh glory to God
[1:49:36] everything was so beautiful there you go
[1:49:39] but it seems like something has happened
[1:49:42] it seems like it's like this and oh oh
[1:49:44] oh oh Lord have mercy Lord have mercy
[1:49:46] woo I bad in my and I missed the
[1:49:48] mountain oh my goodness oh no
[1:49:53] and then you go and go and go and go who
[1:49:55] you bat your eyes again I'm telling you
[1:49:56] better keep your eyes
[1:49:58] open you know what I'm talking about
[1:50:00] what is it it's the powers of Darkness
[1:50:03] that's pressing against this brde like
[1:50:05] never before Oh but I'll tell you we can
[1:50:08] read the back of the book and we found
[1:50:10] out we win this thing Hallelujah we win
[1:50:14] it's not probably it's not maybe you are
[1:50:18] going to
[1:50:20] win and the life enemy that shall be
[1:50:24] destroyed is
[1:50:33] death Lord God put on the whole armor of
[1:50:37] God 1962 this is one of them quotes
[1:50:40] whenever I press play that I hear God
[1:50:44] fortified his army with what
[1:50:47] himself in the
[1:50:49] form of prophets apostles
[1:50:53] teachers pastors what did he do what was
[1:50:57] God doing listen did you ever think of
[1:50:58] what God's offices in the church is it's
[1:51:02] God's
[1:51:04] dress
[1:51:05] inside
[1:51:07] dress an apostle a prophet Seer foresee
[1:51:11] before Satan ever gets to it what is it
[1:51:14] God dressed up in his
[1:51:17] church these offices is God's dress one
[1:51:23] we when you see those offices pastors
[1:51:26] teachers evangelist what is that that's
[1:51:28] God's dress wear God's
[1:51:30] presence right oh
[1:51:36] my I just imagine that Satan and all of
[1:51:40] his
[1:51:42] army the prophet said the only weapon
[1:51:45] that he
[1:51:46] has is to try to get you to doubt your
[1:51:51] weapon that's right that's
[1:51:56] right we believe his word do we not and
[1:51:59] yet Sometimes When We Get Low and we do
[1:52:01] everything we know to do have you ever
[1:52:03] been to that spot where it seemed like
[1:52:04] God was a million miles
[1:52:06] away he wouldn't hear your prayer and
[1:52:10] maybe somebody you work with is as world
[1:52:12] is all get out and maybe they're
[1:52:14] religious and they say well God answer
[1:52:16] my prayer God answered my prayer praise
[1:52:17] the Lord God heal me God done this and
[1:52:19] that ain't it amazing how testimonies
[1:52:22] can be
[1:52:27] discouraging is that right
[1:52:29] sis cuz you saying Lord have you forgot
[1:52:32] where I live if you forgot hey I've been
[1:52:34] slow at times I've been I've been glad
[1:52:36] I've been glad and happy just to hear
[1:52:38] rebuke from him to to just let me know
[1:52:40] he still knows I'm
[1:52:43] alive oh I see right now I ain't the
[1:52:45] only one that's felt well y'all felt the
[1:52:47] same way haven't you but then what do we
[1:52:49] do we serve him anyhow because we're not
[1:52:53] serving him for the fishes and the
[1:52:54] loaves we're not serving him for the
[1:52:57] Mana we're serving him because we love
[1:52:59] him and if he wants to try me let him
[1:53:02] try me but job said when I am tried I
[1:53:06] shall come forth like
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:15] gold listen to this in verse eight they
[1:53:19] all hold swords
[1:53:22] being
[1:53:25] expert in
[1:53:31] War I don't mind telling you I have been
[1:53:34] one blessed
[1:53:38] man when I went to school I was so
[1:53:42] laughed at and ridiculed and made fun of
[1:53:44] because I was a
[1:53:45] Christian I never had any friends I
[1:53:48] still I had a flashback here just a week
[1:53:50] or so ago I was in the second grade and
[1:53:52] I was standing out on the playground at
[1:53:54] school wishing I had a
[1:53:57] friend well that didn't just happen in
[1:53:59] second grade that was in third fourth
[1:54:01] fifth 6th 7th 8th n9th 10th then there
[1:54:04] some boys said they like
[1:54:07] me and I thought wow I've got I got some
[1:54:09] friends cuz we was raised poor you say I
[1:54:12] wore britches to school that looked like
[1:54:15] a dog had a hold of them when they
[1:54:17] wasn't in style
[1:54:22] [Applause]
[1:54:26] I used to wear them red Dollar Store
[1:54:28] tennis shoes that cost a dollar a pair
[1:54:30] when they wasn't in
[1:54:32] style so I was the laughing stock
[1:54:36] ridicule laughed at made fun of and then
[1:54:37] a few boys said they like me but let me
[1:54:39] just give you an idea what my friends
[1:54:41] were like they would bring Playboy
[1:54:43] magazines to school and try to get me to
[1:54:46] look at them and I'd close my eyes and
[1:54:48] then they jump on top of me lay me down
[1:54:51] in the floor and take their fingers and
[1:54:53] try to pull my eyes open like
[1:54:57] this and they were my friends you can
[1:55:01] imagine how my enemies treated
[1:55:03] me so I've always wanted friends I
[1:55:09] have I've always wanted
[1:55:12] friends and God has let me be
[1:55:17] friends with some of the greatest men of
[1:55:19] God of this age I am so
[1:55:24] blessed thank you for being my
[1:55:32] friend I'm sure I'm not the only one
[1:55:34] there's probably people sting here today
[1:55:36] that you were the outcast and rejected
[1:55:38] and nobody liked you because of your
[1:55:40] looks or your wealth or your family
[1:55:42] status or whatever more but Jesus found
[1:55:46] you one
[1:55:50] day and he sent his
[1:55:52] pacquin the baptism of the Holy
[1:55:56] Ghost your
[1:56:01] way every man hath his sword upon his
[1:56:05] thigh because of
[1:56:08] fear in the
[1:56:12] night but the Donnie do you get afraid
[1:56:15] humanly I
[1:56:17] do I do CU we've never been this way
[1:56:20] before
[1:56:23] we've never seen things we're going
[1:56:25] through now
[1:56:26] before but I've learned a way to calm my
[1:56:30] fears feed on the
[1:56:32] word and quote that devil God's word cuz
[1:56:35] he can't stand
[1:56:37] it
[1:56:40] amen so now remember they're going
[1:56:43] there's not an interstate 75 and they
[1:56:46] not an Interstate 71 and you know state
[1:56:48] troopers going up and down the thorough
[1:56:49] fire you know to keep an eye on
[1:56:51] everybody there's
[1:56:52] Bandits there's thieves there's robbers
[1:56:55] there's all kinds of things you imagine
[1:56:57] when they saw that cuz remember the
[1:57:00] elements that was on this
[1:57:01] Peloquin gold deity silver Redemption
[1:57:06] brass judgment being judged the colors
[1:57:10] of purple blue royalty Heavenly oh my

[1:57:23] little bitty tiny tiny insect and they
[1:57:27] could get one drop one drop of dye out
[1:57:32] of the female's body not the male one
[1:57:35] tiny drop you imagine how many that it
[1:57:39] took to make all them curtains and Dy
[1:57:41] them all
[1:57:44] red
[1:57:45] Hallelujah the blue come from a mollusk
[1:57:49] out of the
[1:57:50] Mediterranean don't you from the Animal
[1:57:52] Kingdom from the kingdom of botney life
[1:57:55] from the kingdom of the Stars the
[1:57:57] kingdom of the Dust God is drawing all
[1:58:00] of that together into the bride's
[1:58:02] Journey back home even the Tabernacle
[1:58:05] was made of some of those same things
[1:58:07] and God picked you talking about the
[1:58:09] mystery of God that God picked the
[1:58:13] Batcher you talking about a mean little
[1:58:15] fella some of you ought to say Amen cuz
[1:58:17] you were hopefully you still
[1:58:20] ain't oh my can you imagine imagine
[1:58:22] taking two live Badgers and sewing their
[1:58:27] skins together to make a covering for
[1:58:30] god well you see that's what the
[1:58:32] denominations are trying to do by making
[1:58:34] members out of a church but we don't do
[1:58:36] it that way this is the way we preach it
[1:58:39] you got to
[1:58:40] die well Glory I said you got to die and
[1:58:45] whenever you die to yourself then a man
[1:58:48] of God can take you and your hide and
[1:58:51] sew you right next to somebody else in
[1:58:53] the same church if it wasn't for this
[1:58:56] message some of us wouldn't even speak
[1:58:57] to one another we don't even belong in
[1:59:00] the same class sometime but this word
[1:59:03] has the ability of reaching out and
[1:59:06] getting the fancy and the rich and the
[1:59:08] Knuckleheads and the knads and save them
[1:59:11] all and sanctify them all and fill them
[1:59:13] with the Holy Ghost and what will it
[1:59:16] make up the mystical body of Jesus
[1:59:19] Christ
[1:59:31] they must have had to take it in
[1:59:34] shifts cuz it's several days journey so
[1:59:37] there's going to be some lean
[1:59:42] nights you see there's one thing that we
[1:59:44] have to watch about the lean nights I
[1:59:48] call it the leodan flu
[1:59:52] you read the message to the church age
[1:59:54] and you know that's what it was they had
[1:59:56] a flu it was a lay of the sea and flu so
[1:59:58] they're not at theirself they don't know
[2:00:00] who they are and they don't know this
[2:00:02] and that and the other so we're living
[2:00:03] in a day when a man don't know if he's a
[2:00:05] man or a woman don't know if she's a
[2:00:06] woman and today they're a dog and
[2:00:08] tomorrow they're a cat and you know the
[2:00:09] next thing say oh
[2:00:11] Lord come on somebody don't sit there
[2:00:13] and look at
[2:00:15] me true so there was perils everywhere
[2:00:18] you imagine at the Knights y'all know
[2:00:20] how the nights SS are right I was in
[2:00:23] zimb several years ago on a on a hunt
[2:00:25] some of the brothers out wanted to take
[2:00:26] me on a hunt and I was living saying in
[2:00:28] this little cabin by
[2:00:30] myself and the guy told me and there
[2:00:32] said now don't go out at
[2:00:35] night I said
[2:00:39] why he said cuz there's a leopard that
[2:00:42] roams around here I said you don't have
[2:00:45] to worry about me going
[2:00:47] out brother don't you lack en courage
[2:00:49] well I might like a little bit of
[2:00:50] Courage but I have got some common sense
[2:00:55] so about 3: in the morning I hear this
[2:01:01] noise I sat straight up in the bed my
[2:01:03] hair is kind of wild anyway so I'm just
[2:01:06] standing up on the back of my neck I'm
[2:01:08] thinking oh Lord have mercy what in the
[2:01:11] world and there was no locks on the
[2:01:19] doors so it went around and around it's
[2:01:22] kind of a round shaped
[2:01:24] building so the next
[2:01:27] morning I couldn't wait to see that guy
[2:01:29] and I said man I think I heard that
[2:01:30] leopard he said what kind of noise was
[2:01:32] he making I just made that same sound
[2:01:34] for you he said it was an
[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:40] anater but you know what I thought
[2:01:43] that's the way the devil wants to do you
[2:01:44] and
[2:01:45] I oh I'm G to get you this time I'm G to
[2:01:48] get you you're down you ain't getting
[2:01:50] back up remember it ain't nothing but a
[2:01:52] yellow belly coward devil come on
[2:01:56] somebody he's got a bow but he ain't got
[2:01:58] no Iris he ain't got no power over you
[2:02:02] as a child of God for greater is he that
[2:02:05] is in you than he that is in the
[2:02:10] [Applause]
[2:02:14] world let me
[2:02:18] hurry let's speed this up a little bit
[2:02:25] I can see them as
[2:02:27] there coming in on the last
[2:02:31] day along this journey she's learned
[2:02:34] many
[2:02:36] things no doubt the first day she kind
[2:02:39] of got in that thing know she just got a
[2:02:47] worm but they noticed her the last day
[2:03:00] and they said
[2:03:03] wow she's getting ready for
[2:03:06] him you see as pastors that's what we
[2:03:10] watch your
[2:03:13] walk your everyday walk they don't ready
[2:03:16] impress pastors not not real ones how
[2:03:19] much you can quote the message or quote
[2:03:21] the Bible or taugh the great deep things
[2:03:22] of
[2:03:25] God it's the way you love your wife way
[2:03:28] you love your husband the way you love
[2:03:30] the house of God you love to come to
[2:03:32] church and you can't wait to come to the
[2:03:35] house of
[2:03:36] God so that's what impresses Real Men of
[2:03:38] God is your is your
[2:03:40] walk and in that short Journey no doubt
[2:03:43] they noticed an
[2:03:45] air about her y'all have heard the story
[2:03:48] I'm sure brother bisco told it many
[2:03:50] years ago about the the bride that was
[2:03:52] worth nothing until the man paid all
[2:03:55] those cows for
[2:03:57] her let me tell you how much you're
[2:04:00] worth if I this morning had this bottle
[2:04:03] right here full of the literal blood of
[2:04:04] the Lord
[2:04:07] Jesus well no doubt each one of you'd
[2:04:09] want to come up here and touch it and
[2:04:12] you just say oh
[2:04:13] my oh
[2:04:16] my so if this young brother here wanted
[2:04:18] to touch it and I started to hand it to
[2:04:20] him and I whenever I do it slips out of
[2:04:22] my hand I said oh no oh
[2:04:31] no but you are actually worth
[2:04:36] more than the blood of
[2:04:39] Jesus I know it's
[2:04:43] mindboggling because that's what he was
[2:04:45] willing to pay to get
[2:04:49] you so after church you go to restaurant
[2:04:52] sit down you look at the menu value
[2:04:54] versus cost cost is really high anymore
[2:04:57] a so you'll sit there and look at you
[2:04:59] think do I want us to pay that much for
[2:05:00] that chicken sandwich do I want to pay
[2:05:01] that much for f steak do I want to pay
[2:05:03] that much so it's all about value what
[2:05:04] you'll get out of it and then some of
[2:05:06] you say I ain't paying that much for
[2:05:08] that I'm going to go second down on the
[2:05:09] list and get
[2:05:11] this but Jesus looked at it and said
[2:05:14] it's worth every pain hallu Hallelujah
[2:05:18] and the Bible tells us in the book of
[2:05:19] Hebrews that he feared
[2:05:23] the Lord Jesus
[2:05:26] experienced
[2:05:29] fear I'm
[2:05:31] glad so when I get
[2:05:34] afraid I can go to a high priest Hall
[2:05:38] and he won't berate me he won't you know
[2:05:40] just blast me but he can say I
[2:05:44] understand
[2:05:46] on I understand but I died alone
[2:05:56] so you don't have
[2:05:58] toly I died a
[2:06:01] curse out of the presence of spirit
[2:06:05] God so that when you
[2:06:07] die y though I walk through the valley
[2:06:09] of the shadow of death I will fear no
[2:06:12] evil for thou W with me thy rod and thy
[2:06:15] sta they comfort
[2:06:18] me she's now meditating and thinking
[2:06:23] oh my so it's about 50 miles from
[2:06:28] shunum to Jerusalem 50 miles five of
[2:06:32] course number of
[2:06:34] CRA the Church of the Living God is
[2:06:36] called often pass through Dark starless
[2:06:41] Nights weary times of
[2:06:44] loneliness you see it doesn't take a
[2:06:46] person with very great faiths to be able
[2:06:48] to come up and receive healing and Oh
[2:06:49] Glory to God every time I pray God
[2:06:51] answer my prayer and people think that's
[2:06:53] great
[2:06:55] faith but actually I use this example
[2:06:58] over and over again of sister sasc who
[2:07:00] prayed that God would restore her baby
[2:07:02] back to
[2:07:04] life God told the prophet you leave it
[2:07:06] alone don't touch
[2:07:07] it she saw him later and asked brother
[2:07:11] Brenham the question brother Brenham did
[2:07:13] I not have
[2:07:15] faith he said sister you had great faith
[2:07:20] for when God said
[2:07:23] no you still believed
[2:07:28] him he say man my wife stood there
[2:07:34] October the day Erica's youngest twins
[2:07:37] their birthday was that
[2:07:40] day and she passed that night it was so
[2:07:43] unexpected the doctors was not believing
[2:07:45] that she would nobody did and we prayed
[2:07:49] and we cried and we
[2:07:54] prayed I called brother Daryl ward he
[2:07:56] come sit with us in the
[2:07:58] hospital she got to where she couldn't
[2:08:00] hear us no
[2:08:02] more we kept talking we kept telling her
[2:08:04] we loved her I had my phone in my pocket
[2:08:08] I reached down on my phone and got my
[2:08:10] opened my Bible
[2:08:12] app and I turned to this the Lord is my
[2:08:18] shepherd I shall not want when I started
[2:08:22] reading those words everybody in the
[2:08:23] room just started crying cuz it's like
[2:08:26] we
[2:08:27] realized he was going to take her how
[2:08:30] many love Psalms 23 how many of you know
[2:08:33] very much about Psalm
[2:08:37] 22 my God my God why hast Thou forsaken
[2:08:40] me all my bones they stare at
[2:08:43] me you see before there could be a Psalm
[2:08:47] 23 there had to be a Psalm 22
[2:08:52] so little bride only God knows what
[2:08:54] it'll be on your journey some of you may
[2:08:56] have been tried and you thought you'd
[2:08:58] never be able to do it but God is
[2:09:00] looking for people that he can try
[2:09:02] brother Wayne and I was talking about
[2:09:03] the brothers last night we had a little
[2:09:05] meal together and I told him said I
[2:09:07] thought about that man in John nine that
[2:09:09] was blind and the disciples said who
[2:09:10] saying him or his parents that he was
[2:09:12] born this way Jesus said neither one but
[2:09:15] that the glory of God might be made
[2:09:16] manifest amen but I wonder how many
[2:09:19] Summers that man missed yeah being
[2:09:23] blind wonder how much he was ridiculed
[2:09:25] and made fun of and laughed at maybe
[2:09:28] missed a family wife
[2:09:31] children the price of God's glory wow
[2:09:36] amen any of us willing for that too or
[2:09:39] do we just want shouting and all Victory
[2:09:41] and all healing and I don't myself I'm
[2:09:44] not standing in line and say God I I'll
[2:09:46] take a trial over blessing come on you
[2:09:48] don't think I'm that dumb do you I was
[2:09:50] born in the morning but not yesterday
[2:09:53] morning come on no my first choice would
[2:09:57] be blessing but if God needs a preacher
[2:10:00] in this
[2:10:02] message that can go through hard
[2:10:05] times and God will refuse to seemingly
[2:10:08] answer his
[2:10:09] prayers in the way he wants it if God I
[2:10:12] heard it years ago brother Wayne and it
[2:10:13] pued me hearing brother R said father
[2:10:15] you have broken my heart over and over
[2:10:18] again amen and I thank you for it
[2:10:22] hallelujah
[2:10:23] hallelujah what a blessing it
[2:10:28] is
[2:10:29] oh let me close
[2:10:32] here the prophet said the same elements
[2:10:35] used Cedar Wood not dog
[2:10:37] wood but the cross was Cedar speaking of
[2:10:41] redemption the Cedar and the hisop spoke
[2:10:44] of Christ and the
[2:10:47] cross so here she comes
[2:10:51] her
[2:10:52] matah
[2:10:54] silver
[2:10:56] gold overlaying
[2:10:59] Cedar the cross between the Divine and
[2:11:03] the
[2:11:04] human she rode that right into the
[2:11:08] presence of her
[2:11:10] husband verse 10 and he made pillars
[2:11:13] thereof silver the bottom thereof gold
[2:11:15] the covering of purple the midst thereof
[2:11:17] being paved listen this
[2:11:22] paved with
[2:11:26] love
[2:11:28] paved with
[2:11:31] love so here they come now he would send
[2:11:35] the trumpeters he would send the harpst
[2:11:39] he would send the musicians he would
[2:11:40] send the
[2:11:42] incense because a Runner comes and says
[2:11:46] it's almost
[2:11:47] time she's coming
[2:11:53] so Solomon was
[2:11:55] ready and the bride is ready and they're
[2:11:58] going to
[2:11:59] meet in between her
[2:12:01] home and his
[2:12:03] home so he leaves the
[2:12:06] palace and goes outside now this is
[2:12:09] where we pick it up where the incense
[2:12:11] and all that was going this is where
[2:12:12] this was written from that she's
[2:12:15] actually coming up and what do they do
[2:12:16] they precede her with songs of Zion
[2:12:21] music and
[2:12:23] incense so here's the
[2:12:26] sandalwood the myrrh all those
[2:12:29] fragrances of the Far East and this is
[2:12:33] preceding her
[2:12:36] coming let me reminds you of this and
[2:12:38] going beyond the camp in
[2:12:40] 1964 think of it missing
[2:12:44] people they can't see you
[2:12:47] anymore but you're getting together with
[2:12:51] the rest of the
[2:12:54] group and you come up
[2:12:57] missing on the
[2:12:59] earth amen so one minute the devil's
[2:13:03] looking at you and you disappear and he
[2:13:04] said where'd he
[2:13:06] go where'd she
[2:13:09] go
[2:13:11] right and we're actually missing on the
[2:13:14] earth you know why right streetport
[2:13:18] 1963 he tells us that whenever we we are
[2:13:21] raised that he knows we're we'll be so
[2:13:24] much human that we'd be looking around
[2:13:27] to see if this one made it that one made
[2:13:29] it that one made it so he allows us some
[2:13:33] time to get
[2:13:36] together praise God so you're getting
[2:13:39] together with the rest of the group
[2:13:42] that's
[2:13:44] right I'll tell you since I've been to
[2:13:46] Johnson
[2:13:47] City a couple of months ago I preached
[2:13:51] Carol was it
[2:13:53] 149 149th
[2:13:56] funeral that I've preached since I've
[2:13:58] been there I said God why why have I had
[2:14:03] so Much Death to deal with
[2:14:07] why but then I look at it in another way
[2:14:10] on that Resurrection morning you talking
[2:14:13] about a bunch of folks showing up at my
[2:14:15] house
[2:14:26] who is mdic February
[2:14:29] 1965 therefore if you have died and
[2:14:33] entered into the theophany you bring the
[2:14:38] theophany to meet the redeemed body and
[2:14:41] if you are here you take your body to
[2:14:46] meet the theophany notice the center and
[2:14:48] the focus point of that quote
[2:14:51] it's
[2:14:58] you glory to
[2:15:01] God you understand I know Peter has not
[2:15:04] yet seen
[2:15:06] him nor has Paul nor has James nor
[2:15:10] Thaddius nor any of the rest of the
[2:15:13] brothers they entered into another phase
[2:15:15] of the sixth Dimension remember brother
[2:15:17] rson the sixth Dimension he saw nobody's
[2:15:20] people but but his own he did not see
[2:15:23] Paul he did not see Luther he did not
[2:15:24] see Wesley it would be Unbecoming for
[2:15:28] the bride to see him with those dyed
[2:15:31] garments on who is this that Cometh From
[2:15:34] The Wilderness with dyed garments on
[2:15:37] from
[2:15:38] boero that's what the prophet said in
[2:15:42] the Old
[2:15:44] Testament so they're in the throne room
[2:15:47] on the resurrection morning
[2:15:51] the Lord Jesus will
[2:16:00] stand and go behind the curtain as it
[2:16:05] were and when he comes
[2:16:08] out he's changed
[2:16:14] clothes and he doesn't have on high
[2:16:17] priest garments anymore
[2:16:21] but it's a bridegroom
[2:16:25] garment you see it was Naomi that told
[2:16:27] Ruth to go lay at the feet of Boaz her
[2:16:30] kinsman
[2:16:31] redeemer but she had to change clothes
[2:16:34] before she would go because she had been
[2:16:35] wearing clothing of
[2:16:39] widowhood Glory to God your old husband
[2:16:44] is
[2:16:45] dead

[2:19:51] don't have to deal with worldly people
[2:19:53] that much my greatest scars a lot of
[2:19:56] them are from preachers message
[2:19:58] preachers I thought when I come to this
[2:20:00] message I'd find a quality of people
[2:20:02] like the world had never known I have
[2:20:05] but I've also found some others in there
[2:20:06] too you
[2:20:07] know I never was hurt by Pentecostal
[2:20:10] preachers the way I've been hurt by
[2:20:12] message
[2:20:13] preachers but I'm so glad that God helps
[2:20:16] us that we don't let our
[2:20:18] scars dictate who we
[2:20:23] are and keep this in mind God will never
[2:20:26] hold you accountable for the way that
[2:20:29] people treat you but it will hold you
[2:20:32] accountable for the way you treat people

[2:21:00] it brother Wayne years and years ago he
[2:21:02] shared it with me and it's just a dream
[2:21:03] so I'll tell it it's a dream but it just
[2:21:05] always has blessed my heart and it was
[2:21:07] like he was dreaming about the
[2:21:09] Resurrection The
[2:21:11] Rapture and he said we was all just
[2:21:13] getting together and the Lord Jesus was
[2:21:15] in the midst of us just kind of
[2:21:17] suspended above
[2:21:19] us and we all started looking toward him
[2:21:22] and praising him and worshiping him and
[2:21:26] the more we worshiped the higher he
[2:21:30] raised and the higher he raised the more
[2:21:32] we
[2:21:33] worshiped and the more we worshiped the
[2:21:35] higher he
[2:21:37] raised until he just got way up above
[2:21:40] us and this Splendor was coming from his
[2:21:44] garments and he's just looking down on
[2:21:47] us with his hand stretched out and there
[2:21:51] we were by the
[2:21:52] millions Oh Glory to
[2:21:55] God won't that be worth all that we've
[2:21:58] been through in
[2:22:00] love all the ridicule that you've been
[2:22:02] put up with because of his gospel it'll
[2:22:05] be worth it all one day can we bow our
