This is your victory day. Give him the praise and worship the Lord. Heat. Heat. worship. It's important to understand when God is speaking and sometimes he may seem to be silent but that's when he is working Oh, but just have patience. Just wait and see what our mighty God will do. Oh, when you lift up your hands, God will pull you through. We worship you now. Hallelujah. Oh worship. We worship. If you are crying, worship in your trials. Worship. If you are hurting, worship.

He will never fail. He walks with you. I worship God. Worship. Worship. Oh, I love you. Yeah. Heat. Worship the Lord. worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you begin to worship him, things just begin to change. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been in the countries of the of the uh worshippers of idols. And I've seen out in the streets and you go with them and you see people standing and they maybe bring a sick baby and lay it before a stone idol and that's their god of healing. And then they have another god around the corner, an idol, and it's a god of peace. And then they have a a god of understanding and a god of fertility. And and when they want something, they go worship at the feet of that idol. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know, uh that's a a man-made idol. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's a demon power that allows someone to believe that they can receive something from that stone. &gt;&gt; But yet, we have been given the grace, &gt;&gt; amen, to know the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to worship him, he's the God of peace. &gt;&gt; He's the God of understanding. He's the God of mercy. He's the God of truth. Amen. He is God. And when a worshipper begins to worship him, the things from him begins to come back upon the worshipper. Maybe you'll walk away never the same. You know, you come to the house of God like this on a on a service and you you come and gather in here and people say, you know, what what good does it do? But see, this is God's program of power. &gt;&gt; This is God's program to for saints to gather together and to worship him in song and in music and then and then in front of the word. And then the word begins to be preached. And as the word preaches, uh it casts out spirits. It drives back the enemy. It It forces the devil to leave the mind while the word begins to work in the heart. And under the power of the spoken word, deliverances begin to happen. Things that that you maybe took a lifetime, you've not understood how to do it, but all of a sudden under the preaching of the word, everything has changed. &gt;&gt; Just in that moment, it it completely will change you. I I think brother brother Howard's son Jonathan was in a meeting here a couple years ago and he said, "You know, I've spent my whole life in the message." But in one service, in one service, he come into the presence of the living God and he walked away and said, "I found what I was looking for." &gt;&gt; And you know, that might be where you are tonight. You You may be looking for something and and wondering what it is, but right here in one service, it can forever change your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something you struggle with your heart, your life, something in there and you you're looking for an answer. But when you begin to pull on the word of God, it it it immediately has the power to change. And I certainly believe tonight that we have gathered in this place. Amen. In in a way to welcome the mighty God among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is his word. Amen. I I know you want to invite him. And I think often of Brother Brandham when he said that he'll come where he's invited. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we had a nicer place to offer him tonight, we we would give it to him. We we would give him the best that we could give him. But right now, this is where we are, this building, what we have. &gt;&gt; But we want to make him welcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to welcome him in this place and invite him, open the door to him. Leotaa's got the door closed, but I I I stand here tonight and and and as a as a as a pastor standing here, I I want to open the door. &gt;&gt; I want to say, Lord, this door &gt;&gt; is open to you. &gt;&gt; And to every manifestation of your life. &gt;&gt; We want you more than in the front door. We want you to walk into every corridor. &gt;&gt; Healing and power. These men of God sitting here all in the in in one agreement. the the people are in agreement. How many would just open the door tonight and say, "Lord, come on in this place. &gt;&gt; Come on in here and deal with my heart, my life, my family. We invite you to this platform tonight, Lord." And Amen. We are going to invite Brother Ronnie Long. Amen. A a real gifted uh young man. He's here in our assembly, but we we certainly appreciate the gift that God has placed in his life. And I've seen God use him many times. Uh, brother, uh, I I I don't want to brag too much because these brothers are in our church, but you know, uh, last night hearing, uh, brother Nathan, brother Isaac speak these things, uh, you know, uh, to hear that level of of the of the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Coming out of a young man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I was just sitting there and I was listening to that. I look over at Brother Ray and I hear him hollering, "Amen." And I was thinking, "There is a chip off the old block right there." I tell you man, uh I was just thinking what a you know uh I don't want to take but long but I really want to say this you know I remember when I first come in ministry I was what about 23 what are you now 26 and I was about 23 years old and there was an elder brother been around brother Brown a lot and I went to hear him in these meetings down in Arkansas and he come in there and oh within about the first hour or two of the meeting within two or three days there. He just started talking and he was saying openly that there was no more uh men on the field and God was done and and and what are we going to do cuz there ain't no young men coming up and they I mean he he was I was so discouraged when I left there. I thought my goodness is you know does anybody see the future? Is there any vision? you know, and and then um so, you know, I I look back at that and then I sit there last night and hear Brother Ericson and see the the training that he has put in brother Isaac through all these years. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And to see that God has men with vision that knows &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; knows how to take the the the message that was on the tapes &gt;&gt; and put it into a generation that's going to make it live. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and we're hearing this generation and the revelation of this message, knowing this that if if if there is a tomorrow, this message will live on. &gt;&gt; There are there are young men catching this revelation &gt;&gt; that'll preach this with power and reality. And and and I'm I'm not just speaking of Brother Isaac alone, but he's a great example last night for all of the men of God. Amen. Of what is what this message is about. And and we certainly want to thank him for it. And tonight we we know, amen, that that Brother Ronnie is a is a is a a tremendous man of God with a great gift. But I've seen the Lord use Brother Ronnie in a very supernatural manner. &gt;&gt; And he's moved in behind and took care of some things uh that I've watched it personally happen. And so tonight, I know the availability of the supernatural is in this building. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you'll have confidence and begin to pull on the anointing of God, &gt;&gt; you'll leave here different than you can. &gt;&gt; We want to invite him tonight. We want to invite more than our brother Ronnie. &gt;&gt; We want to invite our Lord Jesus to take a hold of a young man's life &gt;&gt; and use him for his glory. Amen. Amen. Let's let's invite him tonight. Amen. Brother Ben. Oh hell king Jesus. Oh man, the king of kings. &gt;&gt; Is he your king? Oh, heat, heat. One more time. Jesus. Heat. Heat. He's the bright starity. I'm going to praise him forever. I will with thee. I like this part. and throughout all hand throughout eternity. I'm going to praise him forever. I will reign with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. just to think this is just the beginning of the longest worship service that there ever was. &gt;&gt; We're over in eternity. We'll still be worshiping. &gt;&gt; And I don't believe that we have to wait till we cross over all the way. I believe we can start that uh that mighty reunion here and worship him all the way into glory tonight. Amen. We just are thankful to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening and uh just amongst uh such such believers that would come out on a Saturday evening and the rain and the cold, but knowing that there's a there's a greater reward for those that can overcome the storm. Amen. I like it. I I know there's a storm going on outside, but I like what brother Isaac said. I believe there's a storm going on inside as well. Amen. And we just thank the Lord and certainly appreciate your time and confidence to be here tonight. Amen. We just thank you for the songs and the specials that were sung. Amen. We just trust the Lord has been working on your hearts tonight as he uh has prepared us in the way. Just turn to the book of Matthew, the 11th chapter. Just get into the word tonight. And they told me there's cold sandwiches, so they can't get any colder. So, we're not in a hurry. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. Taco Bell's not good for you anyway. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven's not here. I could say they get away with that. Amen. Good to have my parents with with us tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. came in and uh just appreciate them and certainly appreciate you know you know as you're a young man and and maybe you're a young man tonight and here and your your dad is always telling you no matter what happens this message is right &gt;&gt; it it pays off down the road &gt;&gt; you dads keep telling your kids whatever happens &gt;&gt; this word is true &gt;&gt; amen we can look back over the trials of life and see that this This one thing has never changed &gt;&gt; and it always remains. Amen. Certainly good to have brother Diego with us. We got to hear from him and just spent a lot of time on the battlefield with my brother and found him to be a real man of God and mightily used by the Lord in this hour and I believe that there will be a great reward on the other side for the the diligence to bring this word to a &gt;&gt; thank you &gt;&gt; to a generation. Amen. Matthew the 11th chapter. We'll just begin at the third verse. And said unto him, "Art thou he that that should come, or do we look for another?" And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see. The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. &gt;&gt; And John asking a question at the changing of a dispensation. &gt;&gt; Is this him? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or do we look for another? &gt;&gt; I would just like to title this tonight, this thought. Is this him &gt;&gt; or do we look for another? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just ask the Lord to bless this tonight. Father, we just love you. We thank you for your word in this age, Lord, that you Lord have chosen us, Lord, out of the Lord to think on a Saturday evening, Lord. The world is just in its chaos and its confusion, its darkness. But Lord, here tonight we have sanctuary, Father. We have a light in this age, Lord. It's it's your word that has come forth, Father. It's not a Lord a workup of emotion, but Lord, it's a manifestation of your presence, Father. &gt;&gt; And Lord, how aware where we are, Lord, as Lord, as insufficient as we are as humans, Lord, but yet you chose before the foundation of the world, Lord, a an earthn vessel that you might have tabernacle there, Father. Lord, we just thank you for your grace to us, Lord. We just ask that you would just break open your bread to us as we may know you, Lord, along life's way tonight. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. Is this him or do we look for another? I could sum this message up real short. I told the brothers if you want me to, I can just preach about 30 seconds. And brother Jonathan, the answer is yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I have I have seen the one that I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for another one or another one to come. I'm not looking for another dispensation or another era or another age or another prophet or another Messiah. This is the one that our eyes have been looking for. We're not looking for another one to come. And I I believe that that we have we have come too far to look back. Right? But I believe if we maintain the focus of forward, we'll realize we're already walking in the light of the Son of Man. We're not waiting for it to come. We're not waiting for revival to come. As brother Isaac said last night, we are in the middle of the bride's revival. This is the middle of the revival time. So, if you're if you're sitting there in yourself and you're wondering when is revival going to come or when are these great things going to happen, don't look for another thing to come. This is that that was prophesied that would come. And we are living in the in the fullness of times where all of the word has come together. to to sum it up, I'm going to take about an hour to get here, but the long answer, the short answer is yes. This is what we've been looking for. This message is what we've been waiting for. We're not waiting for another another angel or another messenger or another prophet or another gift of the Messa sign. This is what our hearts have longed for. This is what we've been predestined to receive in this age. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As you can tell, I got a lot of here. I'm just going to preach. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Three or four people said, "Just preach it." Well, that's what I intend to do. Revelations the 18th chapter. &gt;&gt; And after these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory. &gt;&gt; And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, "Babylon." How he knows what Babylon is. It's confusion. So, we can say it like this. Confusion the great has fallen. There's a great confusion in Leodysia. Confusion the great has fallen because another mighty angel has already come down in this age and with a loud voice of a trumpet has said confusion has fallen and the earth was lightened with his glory. Now you know I I know I know maybe as a as a child uh you might might think maybe just children are afraid of the dark but I actually have a confession. I'm pretty afraid of the dark. I I I you know I was just working in a house this week and and the lights all went out. And I was in the basement of this place I've never been. I don't know anybody there. Actually, it was a big old huge house for sale. There was nobody there. And the power went out and I was down I was down in the basement where there's no light at all from the outside world. And I I got to be honest, brother Josh. I thought, well, I got to get up. I got to There was something I thought, well, what am I running from? &gt;&gt; Right. Kyle's laughing. He knows what I'm talking. What are you running from when you're in the dark? &gt;&gt; There's some fear there in the dark that you you don't know because you don't know what's out there, right? Or maybe you do know. Maybe you've seen a supernatural world enough to know what lays in dark places and what hides in darkness, right? And and and it it puts this feeling within you that when you're in the darkness, there's there's a fear that grips you somehow. And you're not thinking of any specific thing or any specific issue. But it's just something I got to get out of the dark. I I I got to get out of this darkness. I I got to get to where there's light because when I'm in light, then I'm safe. And you know, if we're all honest with each other, I'm sure we've come into a dark room. And the first thing we want to do is turn on the light, right? Because light brings it brings the darkness out of the room, right? It it causes light to overtake the darkness of the room. And now what was a mystery has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Now it's not confusing to you anymore, but it has been revealed. And you can see, you know, Brother Isaac, you might be walking through the room in the morning when you're getting up real early and your wife's asleep. you got little babies and uh you know you you I'm speaking from experience and you just you get dressed in the dark and sometimes your shirt's on inside out and &gt;&gt; you've tripped over something you don't know what it is but when you turn on the light &gt;&gt; you see oh that's that's what that is &gt;&gt; it's not confusing it's not dangerous it's not something that I should be scared of but when the lights turned on then all of the mystery has been revealed right well I believe this Revelations 18 has come down with power and authority in this age and the earth is lightened by the glory of the manifestation of the word in this hour. So there's nothing mysterious anymore. If I could say it shortly, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. That's why the message came to reveal to us, not to confuse us, not to mystify it, not to wrap us up in some kind of doctrine or some kind of man-made theology, but to reveal that his light has come in this age. And his light will remove all leoty and confusion. His light takes away the mystery of it. Right? Isaiah 9 would say this. The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light. As it was in those days, they didn't have a prophetic voice for 400 years. But Isaiah had prophesied 400 years before that that there would be a great light come. &gt;&gt; And even if you're in the valley of the shadow of death, there's a light coming. And then you're not in darkness anymore, but upon them hath the light shine. Is that you tonight? &gt;&gt; Ah, I'm thankful to be preaching some message, believers. Upon you has the light shined. I don't know if you know that, but that's you in the scripture. Upon you has this light shine. You say, "Well, that was speaking of of the Virgin Mary bringing forth the Christ child." But I would ask, how is it different than where we are living today? This is not another gospel. This is not another Christ which we're preaching to you. This is not another message. This is the same message that he was coming down in the womb of a Virgin Mary has come down in the womb of the church of the living God in this age. It's you, friend. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has overshadowed you. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to that word. Ephesians 5 would say, "For you were sometimes in darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light. &gt;&gt; Don't stay still as children of the light. You know, one thing about light in the gospel, it's always progressing, right? So, you've got to move on with it or you get left behind in darkness. You can't just hold up and say, "Well, this was a good place to camp." But you've got to move on. When the light moves, you move. Now, we have the picture of the pillar of fire and we see it as a still picture. But actually, that that picture is moving. That was just a still photo of a moving fire. If you if you go back and listen to the tape, Brother Benham is constantly saying, "There it is over there. There it is over there. There it is over there." It's moving around. It's never stagnant. It's never still, but it's always on the move. And this word is never still. This word has no end. This word will never cease, but it's always on the move. And you've got to be children of the light, walking in the light. We're on the move, friend. We have been given orders to march on into the light. Ye are the children of the light of this hour. &gt;&gt; March on as Isaiah 60 would say, "Arise, shine." I'm not apologizing for repeating anything. Lord gave me this before. I'm just going to say we're going to repeat. Arise, shine for thy light. Whose light? &gt;&gt; Thy light has come. Is this him &gt;&gt; or do we look for another? &gt;&gt; Is this your light or do we look for another light to come? Thy light has come and is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not in the darkness, friend. Behold that darkness shall cover the earth and grope darkness upon the people. But the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the Lord. &gt;&gt; You could have been in darkness of Leodysa. You could have been in confusion of Babylon. But the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Brother Kyle, you could still be on the side of the road as a 16-year-old boy. But the Lord, you could have been wrapped up in some false doctrine somewhere under some nickelian theology. But the Lord, but the Lord has shined upon you. His mercy has renewed in your life. But the Lord shall raise you out. But the Lord shall raise up a standard. But the Lord shall change your situation. But the Lord shall heal you. But the Lord shall reveal himself to you. But the Lord shall make all things new in you. But the Lord has risen upon the church in this age. I don't know about you, friend, but I've seen his light. I've seen his star, and I've come to worship him. I'm &gt;&gt; not waiting for the star to appear. I've already seen it. I've been a witness, a partaker, &gt;&gt; and his glory &gt;&gt; shall be seen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; This is not a good place for a frowning believer. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God's glory don't look like this. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; His glory has risen upon you. &gt;&gt; I borrow one from my buddy brother Timothy. Do you know you're saved? Notify your face. &gt;&gt; That's why, brother Nathaniel, I don't care if people get mad if I have a good time at church, cuz his glory has risen upon me. His glory has shined upon me. I know that I was headed for destruction, but his glory has been seen upon my life. And I know that he had made a change, and I turned from where I was going and turned in the direction of upward. His glory has been shown upon us. That's what healing comes through the room. It's his glory &gt;&gt; that's being shown upon you. His glory has made all things new. &gt;&gt; And his glory has come down in the stage. Darkness is is in the worst conditions it's ever been. Right &gt;&gt; for the Leodysian church. But we're not of the Leodysian church. We're of a bride church in a bride age under a bride light in bride time under a bride glory in this hour. This is a new day. I know it's Saturday night, but I'm going to say shalom. &gt;&gt; Good morning to the church. Good morning to the believer. We are in the victory lane. We are onward and upward. We're not looking down. We're not discouraged. We're not afraid. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Peace be unto you. Good morning, friends. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good morning, friends. Lamentations. This I recall to my mind. Therefore have I hope. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not. &gt;&gt; They are new. &gt;&gt; Every morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's morning time, friends. &gt;&gt; It means you're laying aside the former things. You're laying down the weights that has so easily beset you and you're running the race which you've been called to to run because the morning has arisen upon thee and you're new. &gt;&gt; You're new. &gt;&gt; If if if an old devil's trying to hold on to you from yesterday or last year, I think it's convenient. Hey, we're at January. This is a new year service. &gt;&gt; If some old devil's trying to hold on to you from 2025, it's time to lay it down. And your mercies have been made new today. And you may have made a mistake there, but this is a new day. You might have fallen into darkness at one time in Leodysia, but this is a new day. The sun is shining again. The sun is up, friend. &gt;&gt; The sun has risen upon us. It's a new day. Not looking back to yesterday, but it's a new day. In message shalom, I'm going to say the church, that's the reason I say shalom to them is because it's God's peace. My when a vindicated word prophet would say that to me, God's peace, it drives away every worry and every fear. And that's what I want to bring you to this new year is not looking back, but we're looking forward &gt;&gt; to the breaking of a new day until there is something great laying ahead of us where the year has been the joy that we've looked forward to the pressing coming of the great light and now we can see it breaking over the horizontal realm. It's breaking between mortality &gt;&gt; Yeah. and immortality. I don't know if you know where you're standing yet in the ages, but it's a pretty important place. Breaking between mortality and immortality. We see it breaking between heavens and earth and an earthbound sickness in a troubled world into a bright shining day of an immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that shall never pass away. It's shalom to the church. &gt;&gt; Now it's light time. I don't know what time it is for the Leodysans, but in here it's light time. This is light time, friend. It's recognizing time. It's light time. It's time to look up &gt;&gt; from where your help cometh from. &gt;&gt; Look up. &gt;&gt; It's light time. This is the light age. You can call whatever you want. The bride age, the eagle age, the overcoming age. You know, you could there's Brother Bannon plainly lays it out for us. &gt;&gt; We're not in Leodysia. Nor are we in a Pentecostal age. We have moved on into the word age where the word is the light among men. We're not looking for a natural electricity light. We're looking at a supernatural vindicated light that has been there since before the foundation of the world. Thy light has come in this age. &gt;&gt; No longer are we children of darkness, but we've been made children of the light. All things new. Psalms 34 would say this. Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That means he answers when you call. &gt;&gt; They looked unto him and they were lightened &gt;&gt; and their faces were not ashamed. &gt;&gt; Come on. This poor man, somebody say this poor man cried. And the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deliverth him. Taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man that trusts in him. Oh, fear the Lord, ye saints, for there is no want or lack to them that trust in him or fear him. There is no lack in us, brother Ben. We don't have to go out to TD Jake. We don't got to go out back to Charles Stanley. We don't got to go back to &gt;&gt; I don't have to pull from an old Oral Roberts sermon. I don't have to pull from from this from this internet phenomena or this internet phenomena. I have a vindicated word in this age. I'm not looking for another, but my light has come. Hallelujah. Blessed are your eyes that have seen and beheld his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tasted and see. &gt;&gt; Two phases to that scripture. Tasting &gt;&gt; and seeing &gt;&gt; in that in that word see there. If you go back to the to the the old uh uh uh Hebrew of it, it means appearance. &gt;&gt; The ability to see, to perceive, or to have a vision. Remember in John 4, I perceive &gt;&gt; that thou art a prophet. &gt;&gt; Same word, right? &gt;&gt; Taste and see. I perceive &gt;&gt; that thou art a prophet. &gt;&gt; Right? She had the faith to see he was a prophet. But when he then he began to tell her all of the secrets of her life, &gt;&gt; she said, "Now I know. Now I know that thou art the Messiah," which we prayed for. She didn't say, "Is it you? Are you the Messiah that I've been praying for? We've been instructed since we were babes that there would be a Messiah come and we worship at this mountain. Is it you or do we look for another? &gt;&gt; No, she was convinced. &gt;&gt; She was convinced and then concerned and then she carried out the work which the Lord had for her. She recognized &gt;&gt; she was in the fellowship with somebody other than just a man. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it wasn't just a man, brother carrying a robe, &gt;&gt; but she had come in contact &gt;&gt; with something that knew every secret about her. &gt;&gt; That knew every every secret thing, every thought that she had within her, a every element that she was holding within her. That being knew &gt;&gt; everything about her. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a man. &gt;&gt; Something had appeared unto her. She knew &gt;&gt; this is the Messiah. This is the one that I've been waiting for. The age of confusion was over for her. &gt;&gt; Babylon the Great had fallen for her. Once your eyes get fixed on the vindicated truth, confusion is over for you. I don't know how to tell you this any planer, friend. Once you get your eyes on the vindicated truth, sickness is over for you. Depression is over for you. Anxiety is over for you. All fear is over for you because your eyes are not fixed on a man or a man's idea or a church or a theology, but your eyes have been fixed on the Messiah that you have been waiting for. We have longed to see this day. We have rejoiced to see this day. Don't tell me to be quiet when I recognize the coming of the Messiah in this age. It does something to me that the world cannot do. You &gt;&gt; say, "Well, brother, &gt;&gt; you just need to get more revelated." &gt;&gt; No, my light has come. &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord has been seen upon me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like if there's a spirit in the age today that would try to stomp out the worship of the believer recognizing their Messiah, I would say it's a false Christ. &gt;&gt; It's a false anointed one in this age because God never told you to calm down your praise and calm down your worship. Isaac quoted it last night. We've seen joy spells and jumping spells, but they were because they recognized &gt;&gt; their name on the Lamb's Book of Life. &gt;&gt; You know, that tells me it's a full access pass when you recognize your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life. &gt;&gt; You won't do anything out of order. &gt;&gt; Simple. &gt;&gt; I don't think I I don't think it's a it's a it's an issue of Maybe, maybe, maybe I just was hearing the prophet today saying, "Maybe that brother just misunderstood me." &gt;&gt; Maybe that's what it was. &gt;&gt; Like how Isaac brought that out last night. It's not the brother. It's an unclean spirit. &gt;&gt; It was never that brother. That brother is a a son of God. &gt;&gt; But it's an unclean spirit that anointed him. &gt;&gt; So you got to recognize it's not a brother that's against you. It's a spirit that's against the move of God in this age. And I would say that if if somebody that's suffering with that spirit of leodyian trample on worship would get more enlightened and more revelated, they would recognize that the seals release true worship in this age of spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Just shine the light on it. It's not it's not it's not mysterious anymore. &gt;&gt; Remember the man would talk about those uh mysterious mountains in Arizona? Superstitious, right? &gt;&gt; There's a lot of superstitions around the move of God, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and Satan would love to hijack the move of God and create false things and create false directions so that our to take our focus off of it. And what's he doing? He's trying to get us to go from one ditch to another ditch. But if our eyes remain focused on him, then we're not going to the left or right depending on who does this or who does that. Two or a tabernacle is not governed by any other person than the Holy Ghost himself. We are not basing on what this internet guy said or this internet guy said. This church is a word church and we are looking at the word and we will not take our eyes. This is what we waited for. This is a word revival. This is what a word revival looks like. Sometimes we dance. Sometimes we cry. Sometimes we shout. But we are in a word revival. This is what it looks like. Friends, don't wait for something else. The devil putting a carrot stick in front of you. But it's a false light. This is the bride's revival. This is why he came in this age. So that you could have joy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The confusion's over, friend. &gt;&gt; We've tasted and we're seeing the goodness of God. Psalms 119, how sweet are thy words unto my taste. Hallelujah. Yay, they're sweeter than honey to my mouth. Though my precepts I I I I get understanding. Therefore, I hate every false way. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank God for understanding in this age. &gt;&gt; And I hate every false way. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. Thy word has illuminated my footsteps to walk on into victory. We can't make it without the word. Friend, if you're trying to walk this walk without the word, you'll be left in utter darkness. But we've been given a light in this age, a commission in this hour that we have a light to walk under. Hallelujah. I could go back to the Old Testament, show you that pillar of fire, but they might get moved, right? And they would try to put down a camp, right? That's why you never build your revival on a man. You never build your revival on an idea or a church or a building or you build your revival on the word because even though that man might be anointed for that time, if he does not choose to go on with the pillar of fire, he will get left behind and everybody under his ministry will get left behind. But thank God that there's true leadership in this age that will walk in the light as we are children of the light. Don't get caught in the glare of a former age, but walk on with God. Just sail on. Just sail on anyway. No matter what it looks like, just sail on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know this maybe be a little little deep. I usually try to take like more of a you thought, but this is what's on my heart. &gt;&gt; Sail on into the word of God. &gt;&gt; You know, if you don't eat, you're going to get left behind. &gt;&gt; Take the book and eat the book. You've got to eat the book. You've got to taste it and then you see. You can't see until you taste the book. You've got to take the book, eat it, and become the book. And then you'll see the glory of God upon thee. Then you'll see a vision. We're not looking for a brother Brandham type vision. This vision of the word is the bride's vision. This is the array that he set before the church. This is what a perfect word bride looks like. &gt;&gt; That's the vision that we're seeing. Without a vision, the people will perish. &gt;&gt; So, we need a vision. So, we've got to be in the word. We've got to be eating the book. We've got to be partaking of the glory of God to see the vision. &gt;&gt; Little scriptural background for you. 1st Samuel 14. And the men of Israel under a man leadership were distressed that day. For Saul had adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man that eateth any food." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; Great kind of leader. Brother Ray &gt;&gt; would tell his his people, "Don't eat any food." &gt;&gt; Cursed is the man that eateth any food. Don't be studying those tapes. &gt;&gt; Oh, you stay away from that book. You know, that was pre63. You know, &gt;&gt; what kind of leader &gt;&gt; would try to keep you from the good fruit of God? &gt;&gt; It's a scarecrow. &gt;&gt; It's a scarecrow in front of the good crops. Any anointing that tells you that quote is not suitable for a believer is a false anointing. &gt;&gt; Your brother said the best way to get rid of a scarecrow &gt;&gt; is you light a match. You know what? A scarecrow is afraid of fire. The best way to get rid of a scarecrow standing in your way is to light it on fire. It cannot stand the heat of true word in this hour. It cannot stand the heat of a pure gospel light in this hour. I say turn up the heat. Let's get rid of the scarecrows. We are believers believing the end time message, &gt;&gt; friend. I can't tell you. You're not going to get out of order. You're a believer. &gt;&gt; If you withhold your praise, then the rocks will cry out. &gt;&gt; Brother Richard, there's no rock that can take your place &gt;&gt; because I've been commissioned and sent here to be a worshipper in this hour. Any anointing that would try to take the worship away from God is a false anointing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That was free. Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that I may be avenged of my enemies. You see how selfish &gt;&gt; uninspired leadership can be. &gt;&gt; So none of the people tasted any food. My what a sad situation. And all are they the land came to wood, and there was honey upon the ground. And when the people were coming to the wood, behold, the honey dropped. But no man put his hand to his mouth. For the people feared the oath. But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath. Wherefore he put forth to the end the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened. That's why the devil don't want you to get in the message of the hour cuz he doesn't want your eyes lightened to the glory of God that is coming this day. Oh, stay away from that. You'll get in the ditch. Stay away from that. You'll get in the ditch. Stay away from bright age. You'll dry up. Stay away from Pentecost. You'll get crazy. There's a middle of the road, friend. Keep your eyes on the message of the hour. Taste and see that this word is true. This is the vindicated word of the hour. This is mana for the believer. Any anointing that would try to take that away from you is a false anointing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'll say this. From 47 to 65 is bride food. &gt;&gt; That's right. The problem is is men have denominated on one sentence &gt;&gt; and not continued on with the light of the pillar of fire. And so therefore they failed to go on with pressing revelation. &gt;&gt; Go back and read shalom when you get time. This is not a a darkness winning battle. &gt;&gt; But can I say this? Darkness is not controlling this battle. &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God makes it very clear. The light is pressing it. The light is pressing the darkness. So the darkness has no control in this hour, but the light is in control. Ye are the light of the world, friends. Ye are the children of the light. You're pressing against the darkness. You may not feel like it. You may not always sound like it, but you are pressing against the darkness in this age. &gt;&gt; This is that this is that time. Isaac was right there last night. This is that transition time. &gt;&gt; That's right. This is a transition from an evening time message to the sun is up. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know where you're standing, friend, but I wish that same anointing, brother Jonathan, that revealed it to me would come down. &gt;&gt; That same anointing that just confirmed it to me just a few hours ago would come down again and reveal it to hearts that are that are needing and wanting and and seeking revelation and seeking God. This is the bright time. This is the hour of the manifestation of the word in the church. But the church has received a heavenly sign, an astronaut. Amen. Jesus Christ in the form of the pillar of fire. He was in the Old Testament and that he was when he met Saul down there on the road to Damascus. The same Jesus here today. And what does it do? Does it bring fear? No. It brings love. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How's the third pull activated? &gt;&gt; It brings &gt;&gt; love, &gt;&gt; a uniting of one another. Amen. A feeling for one another. &gt;&gt; It brings the love of God or uniting us and brings us to the body of Christ into the unity as a bride. That's what it's doing now. The great union. &gt;&gt; They're they're uniting themselves. One group here over here to fight with another one. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you friends, but I'm not interested in fighting with another group. I'm interested in progressing with the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've lost some good friends along life's way, &gt;&gt; but I progressed with the word. I've lost ministering brother that we were at a meeting one time and a brother that I was a good friend of mine, brother Gideon, he came to me in the middle of that meeting and said, "This message isn't the truth." &gt;&gt; And we were preaching a meeting overseas together. &gt;&gt; Said, "Brother, it was nice knowing you. &gt;&gt; I appreciate you. I'll pray for you, but I can't fellowship where you're going. I've got my eyes fixed on something else. Something has been revealed to me that I can't fellowship with you in darkness because I have been made a child of the light in this age. Now, you might lose some good friends. You might lose some family. But wait till we get to the end of this and find out. But the church, the bride is united by one God under one spirit. The spirit of God in the holy union of God to be one holy bride to God all together. Unity of the body. The body waiting as the bride. We call ourselves the bride for the uniting time. The church is so coming together. Oh, can you feel it? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you feel the pulsation of the saints of God coming together for something great? Something they're anticipating. It's it's coming together getting under the word &gt;&gt; the church is coming together should create just a love. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah &gt;&gt; among us &gt;&gt; that we could hardly be away from one another &gt;&gt; when you just you don't have to beg the people to pray. &gt;&gt; You don't have to beg them to worship God. You don't have to beg them to do what's right. They're just so in love with him. Hallelujah. This is not a workup or a force. You're just so in love with him that there's nothing you'd rather do than to fellowship in his courts, than to fellowship in his presence, than to fellowship with another believer, than to fellowship around the throne. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's nothing I'd rather do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else. Hallelujah. 2 Corinthians 4, God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness. You know it's a commandment for you to Micaiah to stand out &gt;&gt; oddballs has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, brother Aaron, God has a sense of humor. I you know sometimes I look at my faults and my failures and my mistakes and my inabilities and it's so the glory can't be put on me. &gt;&gt; Brother Ray, it's so the glory can't be put on a man &gt;&gt; but that the glory might be of his excellency. &gt;&gt; I never did trust a slicker that looks like he's perfect because the glory goes to him. But God has made you a misfit, a reject, an outcast of society, someone who never fit in. never never got in until you came to the place where you were called. And that is because no glory can go to a man. &gt;&gt; All glory goes to God. &gt;&gt; Why do you think he made the prophet the way he did with all his complexes and everybody hated Brandhams and nobody liked me and I never had friends. What a sorrowful life. But he had to go through it &gt;&gt; so that no glory, he knew how unable he was. &gt;&gt; He knew his inabilities so no glory would come to him. It must go to God. &gt;&gt; All glory, power, and honor will go to God. We have this treasure in earth and vessels. We are troubled on every side, yet we're not distressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're perplexed, &gt;&gt; but we're not in despair, &gt;&gt; persecuted, &gt;&gt; but we're not forsaken. &gt;&gt; Cast down, but not destroyed. always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in your body. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I like preaching to a preaching church. Lord God, I'm asking the bride tonight, the ones I feel that is pulled away and waiting, may they separate themselves from everything in the world, they must lay in the presence of the warm sunlight of the son of God, bathing in his word, in his love. It's a vision of his appearing. &gt;&gt; Without a vision, the people perish. &gt;&gt; But this message came to give us a vision &gt;&gt; of his appearing &gt;&gt; in this age. He says, "Don't you take nobody else's word for it. I don't need You don't need me, Ben, to break down this message to you. This message will speak for itself." &gt;&gt; You don't need a man &gt;&gt; to break down this word to you. This word speaks for itself. This word has a voice. This word has a voice in this age. And he may use a man. He may be using a man tonight, but you don't need man for this word to come. God has a voice. &gt;&gt; Let me clear this up. It's not a mechanical device. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not a mechanical device that controls the voice. The pillar of fire controls the voice. The fire has a voice in this age. If you just if you just get under it long enough, you'll be surprised what might come out of your mouth when that fire gets over you and you abide in the presence of the son of man light and you abide under the shadow of the almighty. You might be surprised what your voice is used for. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know that voice sings, the pillar of fire sings. I watch a service after service here and I'll have a song or I I'll be picking up anointing in the preaching and brother Ben will get under that pillar of fire and that anointing will drop on him and he'll pick up right off where the preacher left off. And the same anointing, the pillar of fire also sings. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire has a voice. It will speak for itself. &gt;&gt; Doesn't need me, but I'm glad to be a part of it. I'm glad to be under the shadow of the Almighty. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a voice and I want my voice to go along with this pillar of fire. He is the word. That's right. He's the word to identify his own self. &gt;&gt; He'll identify him. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Not some man saying this is what it is or this is what it is or this is what it is. He came under no private interpretation. He came to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're not smart enough. Right. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much education you've had, &gt;&gt; how much doctorate you have, &gt;&gt; you're not smart enough to understand the wisdom of God. That's why he had to come down to a Kentucky hillbilly who knew I'm not smart enough to figure this out. So it took God to come and anoint some broken vessel that he could use him like he's used no other man before to speak the words of God in this age that we might have life and have it abundant. Hallelujah. This message is our identification. &gt;&gt; My face is not ashamed of the message of the hour. I've been identified with it. &gt;&gt; We know what the message came here for. &gt;&gt; Remember the short version of this sermon. Yes. This is it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is that. &gt;&gt; This is what was prophesied. &gt;&gt; This is it. It's been thoroughly identified to us through all of the ages of coming prophecy. This message has fulfilled every period, &gt;&gt; every line, every jot, every tit, &gt;&gt; and it's come down to your home. That's right. &gt;&gt; I think brother Kyle did it on New Year's. You say that we know what the third pole is. We know what the third pole is. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for somebody to come. &gt;&gt; Some great revelator. &gt;&gt; I got news for Can I preach a little bit? &gt;&gt; The thunders have already thundered. We're not waiting for another thunder to come and reveal and break it down to us that we have to come worship at some man's feet that he might bring unto us the bread of life. But this thunder has already sounded in this age that we can have freedom and liberty. You've got the message in your hand, friend. You've got authority in your head. You don't need a thunder to come. The thunder is already sounded in this age. The thunder is already rang. It's the voice of God. And it's revealed the mysteries unto you. You're not waiting for something. The light has come. &gt;&gt; It's not a mystery anymore. &gt;&gt; Shalom, friend. &gt;&gt; Thy light has come. &gt;&gt; This is the perfected word in this hour. &gt;&gt; It's come. We know what the third pole is. We all understand that. We You You have the tape. He says, Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "I think it'll just lay dormant for a while, &gt;&gt; brother Mike." &gt;&gt; They're for about a 50 60 year span, maybe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That third pole &gt;&gt; will lay dormant for a while. &gt;&gt; But at the appointed time, &gt;&gt; that vision will speak for itself. &gt;&gt; That third pull power will speak once again. And it'll have a voice because they'll be so surrendered to the word of God that they will be the final voice in the final age. The third pull is speaking again. Brother Ray, he's riding this trail again. This is the third pull manifestation of the sons of God. This is the authority. This is the fullness of sons. This is if you say to this mountain, that is this age that we are in. &gt;&gt; Man, I got news. It's not coming. It's arrived. &gt;&gt; It's not a far out somewhere. It's here. &gt;&gt; He comes where he's invited and he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, if I was in a cabin back in Kentucky, like had he ride and the prophet came to me, the authority that was in that cabin is here." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that the anointing in that room was greater than it was at the dawn of creation. What a light. &gt;&gt; What a light, brother Aiden. Not just a light switch flicking on, but that light was greater than the one at the beginning of creation. And it has come down into this age &gt;&gt; unto these people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; I just listened to the prophet today talk about that scene. &gt;&gt; Just thinking about it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; brother Aaron, when your haddy riot moment comes, &gt;&gt; what are you going to ask for? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; What's important? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm speaking to Hattie rights. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the truth. Your hadyright moment has come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What will you speak? &gt;&gt; What's really important? &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham said she thought for a minute, well, what would I ask for? &gt;&gt; What would I ask for, brother Jonathan? What would I ask for? &gt;&gt; And a revelation struck her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What's the thing that your soul has longed for? What's the thing that you have been travailing for and crying out for? What's the thing that you hunger for more than anything else? What is that to you, Hattie? Write what is the thing that motivates your prayer life? What is the thing that motivates your worship unto him? This message wasn't just one had right opportunity and done. &gt;&gt; But it's always if he did it for her, &gt;&gt; brother Robson, if he did it for her, then he's obligated by his word to do it for me and for you and for you and to all them. Hallelujah. This is the promise of the end time believer. If you say &gt;&gt; no other age has had this commission until this time under this age under this ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe that glory &gt;&gt; that's when it will be &gt;&gt; it'll speak. &gt;&gt; It'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly. And now just wait to see what it done. It'll speak. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Habacook says, "And the Lord answered to me and said, write the vision &gt;&gt; and make it plain upon the tablets that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're there. &gt;&gt; You've arrived. &gt;&gt; But at the end, what time are we in? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The end. &gt;&gt; It shall speak &gt;&gt; and it shall not lie. &gt;&gt; Though it tar, wait for it. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it will surely come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What would I ask for? &gt;&gt; Well, this takes a great understanding. &gt;&gt; We ask not because we have not. &gt;&gt; And we have not because we ask not. &gt;&gt; And we ask not because we believe not. &gt;&gt; And why don't we believe? Because we don't understand. It's not any harder for God &gt;&gt; to heal cancer. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take any more power from God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To heal cancer. &gt;&gt; Than it does for for for you to have a successful walk out to the car tonight. &gt;&gt; God's power is infinite. &gt;&gt; So therefore, you cannot take from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's ever growing. &gt;&gt; It's It's ever going on. So, it doesn't take It's not going to take any more power. Sister Ella, when when you were filled with the Holy Ghost, it didn't take any more power out of God. &gt;&gt; He's still all powerful. &gt;&gt; And the same God that filled you once will refill you again. And the same God that gave you healing once will heal you again. But that same power isn't just for healing of a temporary body. That power is for an understanding of a heavenly realm where you will not cease. You will have no end. Oh, this body. That's why Hatty Wright couldn't ask for her sister or her mom or her dad cuz they would eventually die. But she knew a greater revelation of understanding was that the soul liveth on. The soul has no end. The soul that trusts in God shall never perish. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now I want to try I believe the Lord has somehow this is a quote at a prisoner has given me a little insight on the reasons why there is some people that are not healed. I think the prophet would know something about that sir &gt;&gt; and I believe it's a lack of understanding &gt;&gt; and I believe we'll maybe speak on that on Sunday morning. He says, "So, uh, you know, me being me, I skipped ahead to what he would speak on that. It's a day of confusion &gt;&gt; where the devil has taken the people into a state of confusion where they don't understand that God's healing is for you. &gt;&gt; When you get the revelation of who of of who he is, then you get the revelation of who you are. And when you get the revelation that he's a healer, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; We don't lack understanding, friends. We have the message of the hour &gt;&gt; if we're in it. &gt;&gt; If we would only know what day we are living in. There wouldn't be so much confusion about this message and about the scriptures that we're trying to bring to the people. If the people only understood that we're at the end time. And when that when that light hit that little woman in that shape, a a red light woman, if that word that identified she had read the scripture and she knowed what the word said and then she seen that word manifested quickly, she recognized it to be the Messiah. &gt;&gt; If she could do that under them conditions, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't want to show hands, man. Any of you married to to six people right now? If she could do that under them conditions, what ought we to do tonight if we could see him do the same thing? A bornagain church filled with the Holy Ghost looking for his coming. It ought to empty every wheelchair through here. Every sinner ought to fall out around the altar. It proves he lives. Hallelujah. If she can do that for for her, &gt;&gt; then what would this message do for sanctified lives that are know we're trying our hardest to live this word? What would it do for us? The same God that spoke to the woman at the well. It's the same God in this message today is the same God in authority that comes out from this pulpit today. The same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see a man who's told me the things. &gt;&gt; This must be the Messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With the eyes of God's fellowship with the Lord today and it hit me so real. &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne, it just opened to me. &gt;&gt; This message, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; It is Messiah. &gt;&gt; This message is the Messiah. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another one to come. &gt;&gt; This is Messiah. &gt;&gt; Come see the one who told me. Come see the one. &gt;&gt; This is the Messiah. I'm not waiting for another one to come. This Messiah has come and he's revealed the secret of my heart. He's revealed the secret of my mind. This is the Messiah message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the Messiah. Is this it? Or do we look for another? No, friend. This is the promised Messiah of this age. The creator of heavens and earth, the prince of peace, the mighty God, king of kings. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil put it out for you somewhere. &gt;&gt; Oh, one day. &gt;&gt; One day. &gt;&gt; That's why you can't miss the rapture, Ella. &gt;&gt; You can't miss it, &gt;&gt; cuz it's happening now. &gt;&gt; This bride's revival is the rapture of the church. &gt;&gt; This is we're stepping into another reality. &gt;&gt; We're stepping into another dimension. This rapture is not the the finished work of the rapture is the changing of our body. But the changing of our spirit is happening right now. The changing of the dominion of what we're under is happening right now. We're not waiting for it to come. &gt;&gt; It's already come. &gt;&gt; You're not missing it. Get in it. You're not going to miss the rapture. Step into the rapture and get on board. This is the prize move in this hour. You can't miss it, friend. It came for you and it called your name. &gt;&gt; How many knows that the message can speak your name directly? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can it not speak your name directly &gt;&gt; and call you out of the middle of your situation? &gt;&gt; Did it not happen last night, Zion? &gt;&gt; This message will call your name. &gt;&gt; This message will call you out of your situation. Is that right, Sister Tara? It'll call you right out of confusion into a perfect light. Amen. &gt;&gt; This message will call your name. It has a voice. &gt;&gt; It might be used in Isaac or Wayne or Ray or whoever, but it has a voice. &gt;&gt; And any surrendered vessel, &gt;&gt; the only gift that I possess &gt;&gt; is a gift to get out of the way &gt;&gt; and let his voice &gt;&gt; the creator of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, how do you do that? That's his word. That's the word itself being made manifest. The word will make itself manifest in you if you'll believe it. Take away the clouds of doubt. The sun is shining. The sen is shining. His power is here in the room to make every one of you well. &gt;&gt; If you believe it. &gt;&gt; Have you heard your name called? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got too much here. &gt;&gt; Have you heard your name called? Have you understood? Remember you hit that road to Emmas last night. Oh fools and slow of heart to not understand. &gt;&gt; But friend, the word has been broken unto us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The bread of life has been broken up unto us. &gt;&gt; And it was the way that he revealed himself to them. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Can I be honest with you, brother Eric? &gt;&gt; I've been a fool and slow of heart. &gt;&gt; No, Lord. This is too great. It's too great for me. I'm just a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's too great for me. &gt;&gt; I cannot attain it. My ways are too high. Oh, fool and slow of heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To not believe all that the prophets have taught. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know that your pride can get in the way of your victory. &gt;&gt; And not in the way you think. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just so good. &gt;&gt; No. Your pride to not accept his grace can get in the way of your victory. &gt;&gt; I didn't come up with this. The Lord gave it to me. Your pride can get in the way of him dealing with you because you can be a fool and slow of heart to believe all that the word has promised in this age. Is he God or is he not God? Did he come to ransom the captive or did he not? And you're in captivity maybe right now, but that's why he came. Not so you can remain in captivity or confusion that you can recognize your hour has come. &gt;&gt; Your light has come. &gt;&gt; Don't let pride get in the way of a move of God in your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your grace is sufficient for me. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You can clean even the dirtiest sinner's heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You can come and heal me in the middle of my situation. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You can fill me with the Holy Ghost even now. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I renounce my pride and I say, "Have your way with me, Lord. If you want to use me, use me. If you want to fill me, fill me. If you want to heal me, heal me." just now. Lord, I surrender my pride to you. &gt;&gt; He resists the pride. &gt;&gt; He's trying to get his grace into the church and they're not allowing it. &gt;&gt; Some legalism called formalism has defied the grace of God. &gt;&gt; He resists the proud. &gt;&gt; If God's not God enough to deal with a sinner, then I don't want to serve him. If God's not mighty enough to heal diseases they don't have names for, then I don't want to serve him. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If God's not mighty enough to fill &gt;&gt; the most confused heart with his spirit, &gt;&gt; but Warren, I don't want to serve him. &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. &gt;&gt; But I serve a God. serve a true God. &gt;&gt; I serve a Messiah &gt;&gt; that has come in this age &gt;&gt; and he is able to take the fest sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing to &gt;&gt; He's able to turn a cold heart on fire. Yes. &gt;&gt; You may think that you've gotten cold on the Lord and you're you're too far away and you think something's blocking my victory. Something's in the way. Something is hindering me from getting into the presence of God. And and and these words are powerful, but they're just not striking me. And they're just not coming to my street or my avenue. And I'm not going to be healed tonight. And I'm not going to be victorious tonight because there's something I've done in my life that's a lie from the devil. Our God is a mighty conqueror and he takes every spirit captive under his spirit. He has the authority. He has the power. He has the anointing in this hour to take every spirit subject under his. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it's called. I don't care how cold you are. I don't care how distant you are. You may not even believe in the God that I'm talking about, but he cares for you anyways. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heard the prophet say, "Oh God, create in me a care. &gt;&gt; You cared. &gt;&gt; You cared so much for me, Lord. Create in me a care to care for you like that. Create in me a care to care for your people like that. Created me a care for your word, Lord." Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. His His knowledge is too great for us to comprehend. How could we limit the grace of God in our lives? &gt;&gt; I And that's the reason today that the churches are blind is because they won't accept revelation that's being vindicated. &gt;&gt; If the word says so and it's revealed, &gt;&gt; then it's proven. That's the reason these Jews, the Jews today will not, you cannot talk to them about Christ because the veil is still over their face. &gt;&gt; They're blinded, but not for long, friend. &gt;&gt; Messiah's back. &gt;&gt; The Messiah that they missed the first time &gt;&gt; has come again. &gt;&gt; He's come again in this ministry, in this age. &gt;&gt; The Messiah is back. You can't talk to them about that in the church today. You can't talk to them about the full gospel and the power of God. You all know you know when you start sharing testimonies with some make believer &gt;&gt; you start sharing them. Brother Donovan you start sharing about your experience. We got filled with the Holy Ghost and you know how it is. We work in construction. We had to interact with all kind of spirits. You start witnessing to them and sharing with them. He's one of those. &gt;&gt; Guilty. I is. I'm one of them. Brother Ben kind of said it the other day. We used this saying when I was a kid, when I was on fire for the Lord. I said, "If loving the Lord is wrong, I don't want to be right." Yes, sir. Cuz I love him and I want to be right in his eyes. I want to be right in his ways. I don't care what man thinks about me. &gt;&gt; I'm way too far gone for that. &gt;&gt; So why would we dumb down to some Leo to see an idea of what we should look like and how we should act when we are the children of the light and we are walking in the light and the fullness in this age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the god of this world has blinded them from the truths of God and they lean to their own understanding. There's a veil over their face. They've been blinded. But I believe I'm speaking of some Lazaruses &gt;&gt; that have been resurrected from the dead that have been called back to life. And not only did he just leave you in that broken state, but he loosed you. He broke the binds off your hands. Brother Caleb, why did he loose your handshuh? Cuz he knew you'd need to wave them. Why did he loose your feet? Cuz he knew you'd need to dance. Why did he loose you from the grave clothes of depression? You &gt;&gt; know, last thing he did for the raid of me, he took the veil off my face. He took that napkin off my face that I could see him as he is. That I could see the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; As Simeon said, I'll see the Lord's Christ. &gt;&gt; I'll see the coming of the Messiah in this age. I'm looking at him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at the Messiah coming in this age. Your Messiah. How marvelous is this thing in our eyes? This is the Lord's doing. This is the day that the Lord hath made. We will rejoice. &gt;&gt; You can't use that word in church. &gt;&gt; We will rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hey man, you might be stuck in Pentecost, but I'm in a bride age. This is the day that the Lord has made, and I will rejoice and be glad in it. This is our day. This is our dispensation. This is our time. This is pride time. Don't be weary, friend. Don't be down. Shalom. The Messiah has returned. This is the day that the Lord has made. And it is good. It is good in his sight. It is good that they would praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is good to recognize. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is appearing. &gt;&gt; It's recognizing time, friends. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I just Can I get a little simple, brother? &gt;&gt; Right out of the the Strong's concordance, the teacher's favorite weapon, the strong concordance. Rejoice properly to spin around &gt;&gt; under the influence of any violent emotion. &gt;&gt; That is usually rejoice, be glad, be joyful, at peace. &gt;&gt; This is the day that the Lord has made. &gt;&gt; I will rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know I'm scriptural when I do that. I'm just going to whack that devil run one more time. &gt;&gt; You would try to steal the praise and the worship out of our young people say they're fanatics or they're going off too far somewhere. This is the day. &gt;&gt; There has never been a day like this day to rejoice because the Messiah has returned. A Pentecostal revival doesn't even know what this is about because the son of man has come. The son of man is being revealed in the church. This is the time to rejoice and be glad in it. This is the Lord's day and it is good in my sight. &gt;&gt; It is good in the sight of God that men would worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Defy that cold old formal devil. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for revival. We're in revival. &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's day. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; It's his glory, &gt;&gt; not your inability. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know the Bible says that there's specific people called for specific roles, right? &gt;&gt; Not everybody's a dancer. &gt;&gt; God knows. Don't give me a microphone to sing a special. Come on. &gt;&gt; Everybody has a role. &gt;&gt; But can I help our dancers out for a minute? &gt;&gt; How many of you would like to just rejoice in the Lord? Spring up and just let that freedom ring, but there's some old condemnation, &gt;&gt; some old condemnation come down on you and say, "Oh, you you're you're in the flesh. &gt;&gt; You're not even a real believer." reach &gt;&gt; you know he's told you that and you that and you that &gt;&gt; you know what we're doing right now we're exposing him &gt;&gt; cuz it takes the mystery off of it. &gt;&gt; It takes that mysteriousness off of it. &gt;&gt; Well, should I be or should I not be? Well, what is the Lord telling you to do? &gt;&gt; Hey man, I know for me, Lord comes down, I can't control it. Me and Brother Diego have been preaching some meetings together. Lord, come down. I lose my interpreter for about 15 minutes running around the building dancing. I say, "Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let the glory of the Lord fall among us." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're not we're not robots, friends. &gt;&gt; We're not programmed by some by some computer chip inside of us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I like preaching at home. You're free. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be ashamed of how you worship. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the Lord comes and I can just do nothing but weep in his presence. I don't think about dancing. I don't think about running. I just think about weeping. Sometimes I let out a whale. &gt;&gt; Brother asked me one time here in this assembly. He said, "Do you think it's it's odd that I let out a whale in the presence of the Lord?" I said, "No, brother. I do the same thing when the Lord comes down. When I'm in my study, if you'd have been in my room just a few hours ago, you'd have heard some whailing. You'd have heard some some some wailing and thanking God for his grace that has come in this age. &gt;&gt; The Messiah's amongst us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some pray standing. Some pray on their knees. &gt;&gt; You're not robots, friends. You're free to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're free to give him glory as you feel led to give him glory. The light has come in this age. &gt;&gt; It's been unsealed. I've waited too long to get to my point. Just give me a few minutes. I'm not going to say five cuz I don't know. &gt;&gt; It's been unsealed in this age. &gt;&gt; So rich. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's why I don't worry, Tyler, if somebody calls me Pentecostal. They're &gt;&gt; just not as revelated as me. &gt;&gt; It's been unsealed in this age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One time, I probably told you the story. We were in Hawaii. There was no message church there. And brother Mark, we went to UPC church. Not one time did I hear the Son of Man being preached. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not one time did I hear did I hear the seals being preached and opened. Not one time did I hear that Jesus had returned on the earth in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not one time. &gt;&gt; And people tried to call me a Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Running around the building like crazy and I didn't feel a thing. Brother Richard didn't feel one thing. &gt;&gt; Pastor comes up to me, "You spoke in tongues?" &gt;&gt; Said, "Yes, sir." He asked my wife, "Are you spoken in tongues?" She said, "Yes, sir." He's like, "Ah, you're one of the weird ones." And then takes off running. But I learned a valuable lesson that day. The devil will try to imitate &gt;&gt; and try to mimic anything he can to get your distraction away from the true move of God and to look at the false anointing and the false anointing over here. Don't make me come against the Methodists either. &gt;&gt; Well, in my church, we don't act like that. &gt;&gt; There's never been a day like this day, friend. &gt;&gt; There has never been a revealed word in this hour like there is right now that the Son of Man is in plain view. He's been open to the age. Let me tell you this. If you're ever going to rejoice, Ellie, if you're ever going to rejoice, it's going to be in this age &gt;&gt; because you're not going to change when you get over there. Don't think, brother Elijah, one day when I get a real victory, then I'm going to &gt;&gt; It's happening now. &gt;&gt; This is the revival of the bride. &gt;&gt; Don't withhold something from him when he has come down into our midst and he is asking of us. Do you recognize me? &gt;&gt; We're not looking at nail pierced hands. &gt;&gt; We're looking at the word. &gt;&gt; We're looking at the Messiah word returned in this age. &gt;&gt; I know where my eyes are fixed. Not fixed on some man. You could call me a man worshipper. You have no idea what I believe. I believe in the Messiah has come down in this age and he used the voice of William Brandham and he anointed his life that he could be someone to reach the pinnacle of what God can do in this age. But it didn't stop there. Thank God it continued on that you might be partakers of his holiness. That you might be partakers of his grace. That you can reach the heights of heaven. You're not given a Messiah sign. There's not another one coming. &gt;&gt; Stop trying to measure yourself to what you think brother Brandon was. &gt;&gt; Behind the gift, he was a believer. &gt;&gt; He was an adopted son of God &gt;&gt; with the mechanics and the dynamics falling at the same time. I'm doing something dangerous. I'm I'm skipping through a bunch of notes. The mechanics and the dynamics at the same time, right? We've got mechanics. &gt;&gt; Our Sunday school kids could out teach most theologians. &gt;&gt; We know the mechanics, friends, and we need them. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Do we need them? &gt;&gt; Be right in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Be right in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But it'll just be dead works. &gt;&gt; Right. Without the dynamic power applied, &gt;&gt; it'll just be death theology without the dynamic power applied. Dynamics means the branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces. The forces of properties which stimulate growth, development or change with the process &gt;&gt; to stimulate growth &gt;&gt; or change within the process. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that adopted sons can rejoice? &gt;&gt; That adopted sons can have liberty to praise. that your adoption does not take away your ability to give God praise. &gt;&gt; But the dynamics and the mechanics have come together to grow you into the stature of Jesus Christ in this age. This is why the message camel &gt;&gt; to grow you into the stature of what you were meant to be. This is the coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is his coming. This is why he has promised to come in this age. Remember, Satan will impersonate. He'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do. He's tried to do it. And we notice that in this one thing, he cannot impersonate. &gt;&gt; There will be no mimics cuz he don't know it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He don't know it. There's no way for him to know it. It's the third pole. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows nothing about it. He doesn't understand it. But there's a secret that lays beneath that. Glory to God in the highest. I can never think the same the rest of my life. Hallelujah. I could relate. I can never think the same again. I don't know. I don't know where this next step is. I don't know what how to interpret that. It won't be long. But I've got it wrote down here when it happened. &gt;&gt; And right here, it tells them to stop &gt;&gt; and go no further. &gt;&gt; You're not here. &gt;&gt; Seal it up till the end time. &gt;&gt; What time are we in, friends? The mystery of it is those seals. Each one of those churches has made an organization and got into it. And that's one of the secret things that's been wrong before God. So there were secrets of what the church was falling into revealed in the seals. But there was a secret for the bride &gt;&gt; revealed in them seals. Hallelujah. And the true word will come to a certain group of people. And the son of man will reveal himself in the midst of them. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh my. I love that. I love to brag on him. I love to make him big before the people. I don't have to make him big. He's already big. He's so high you can't get over him. He's so deep you can't get under him. So wide you can't get around him. And yet you got room in your heart for him. Oh, won't you receive this wonderful Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So big you can't attain him. Yet he's small enough to come live in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We were sometimes in darkness, but now we are in the light. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You hear me, young people? &gt;&gt; Get it? have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But rather reprove them, but all things are made manifest by the light. &gt;&gt; Wherefore he say, awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the heart? Job would say, the entrance of thy words giveth light. It giveth understanding unto the simple. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; brother Ben. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It giveth understanding unto the simple. Now, remember, as I've said, everything's in a three. He's coming in a three. The first time he came to redeem his bride. The second time he comes to catch away his bride. Love affair comes around and steals out. At night time, takes her away from the world. Meet him in the air. The secret coming of the Lord. See, the second time he come is to receive his bride. first time to redeem her, second time to receive her, and the third time with her king and queen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we're living in the seven church age when the Bible said in the seven church age uh sound his message that the mysteries uh and the things would be all twisted up and down through the age and revealed in that time. And here we see it, the son of man coming among his people and doing just exactly confirming his message that he said he would do it. And here we find it in the last age and the seven watches. The seven how he remembers the seven watches in the scripture. He didn't come the first watch, the second, third, fourth, but he come in the seventh watch. That was Enoch the seventh which was translated and Noah being a type of the ren of the Jews is carried over. Thinking about the watches now. Now we're not divided into hours. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The night is not divided in hours in the Bible. &gt;&gt; It was divided in watches. There was three watches. Now the first watch was to start at 9 to 12. The second watch started from 12 to 3. And the third watch was was the night was counted 3 to six. Now we got three three which is nine an imperfect number. &gt;&gt; So three is only perfect in certain rotation. &gt;&gt; Nine an imperfect number. Then we come back to the seven for the rapture which will take place I believe between 6 and 7:00 or 6 and 9:00 some morning for the trumpet of the Lord shall sound. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What time is it, friend? &gt;&gt; It's between 6 and 9. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you're looking for him to descend, you missed it. The Lord has already come. We're not in the evening time. The evening time message was to prepare the church to receive the seed of God, but we're not in the night phase anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got so much to preach on this. I'm just going to preach. We're not in the night season anymore, &gt;&gt; but we're in another season. This is your season to be blessed. This is your season to raise up out of darkness. This is the breaking light. How do you know? The pastor said a few weeks ago, "How do you know whether it's a sunrise or a sunset?" It depends on which direction you're looking. It depends on if you know what time it is. I know what time it is. This is bride time. This is not going into an evening, but the evening and the day were the first day and the second day. And God said it was good &gt;&gt; because it's the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Friend, the Messiah is rising over the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the rising of the sun, friend. &gt;&gt; It's bride time. &gt;&gt; It's morning time. &gt;&gt; We're not going down. &gt;&gt; We're coming up. &gt;&gt; We're not getting ready for a great a great tribulation. &gt;&gt; Not me. &gt;&gt; I'm rising up. I've been called and elected to see a bride rising up in this day. &gt;&gt; I say there's a bride age open. Why don't we step all the way into it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The anointed one. Is that what Messiah means? &gt;&gt; That's what the message means to me. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; This is the anointed one. &gt;&gt; And it knows who's his. &gt;&gt; It knows who belongs to him. &gt;&gt; It has their names inscribed on the palms of his hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not going to miss it, friend. You just got to step into it. &gt;&gt; Rather, I'll say this. He's stepping into you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There he was. Brother Bram said, pulled some pot ash and some chemicals and &gt;&gt; he created a body in Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Came and stepped into it. Brother Jonathan, he's doing the same thing in this hour. &gt;&gt; He's stepping into you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's stepping into your body. &gt;&gt; I know what this kind of preaching does. &gt;&gt; It challenges us. &gt;&gt; You think, "Oh, no." &gt;&gt; Don't let your pride &gt;&gt; get in the way of his grace. &gt;&gt; Couldn't get away from it. Noah got to preach grace. Don't let your pride &gt;&gt; get in the way of his plan. &gt;&gt; If he chose you, &gt;&gt; then he's able to change you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, &gt;&gt; if he chose you and he's stepping into you, then he's able to make all things new. This is the age we're living in. It's one of the grandest ages of ages, the grandest of all church ages because it's the ending time blending of eternity. And now we're approaching these seven seals. We just finished the message of the seventh ages. This message on teaching that's going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus. That eternal age at the end of the seals. &gt;&gt; You know where we're at now, right? Now you see it's a door. &gt;&gt; I just was thanking the Lord when you said that brother Wayne Leo to see his door shut &gt;&gt; but we're not in Revelations 3. &gt;&gt; We're in Revelations 4 &gt;&gt; and there's another door opened. &gt;&gt; I'm not in Leodysia, friend. &gt;&gt; This is the coming of the Lord. You see it's this door. The next thing is the coming of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we realize we're at the closing time. Time is running out. It's blending with eternity. &gt;&gt; We're at the west coast and civilization has traveled east to west. So has the gospel traveled with it. And now there is no place to go back to. &gt;&gt; It's completed. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; The work is finished. He has arrived. I know you know it well. Perosa, Matthew 24, the coming, arrival, event, the future visible return of heaven from heaven to Jesus to raise the dead and set up formally his glorious kingdom. &gt;&gt; What I wanted to take from this is that noun, brother Diego, if it was perceio, it would be masculine, but it's parosia. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right. Bride &gt;&gt; is feminine. &gt;&gt; He's coming in the bride body. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? He's come &gt;&gt; looking for &gt;&gt; this is the one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That my soul has longed for. &gt;&gt; This is the one. And when it becomes a revelation to you &gt;&gt; that Messiah has come in you &gt;&gt; and has brought all of his benefits with you. &gt;&gt; It's the end of all strife. &gt;&gt; It's the end of all depression. &gt;&gt; It's the end of all sickness. &gt;&gt; When it's a revelation to you &gt;&gt; that you're already healed. You know, some of you could have been healed and were healed while this word was going forth. &gt;&gt; You know, spirits were lifted. &gt;&gt; Hearts were turned. &gt;&gt; Last night, I watched a man of God get so out of the way, come right down into somebody's living room. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What does that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not Isaac. It's not me. It's not Nathan, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's the Messiah. &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Troy, what gave you the authority to talk to your sister-in-law? &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing in his church. &gt;&gt; He's arrived &gt;&gt; in her. She is him. She is him. Brother Ben, if you come or whoever's doing the music, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you have the revelation within you that healing is not coming, it has come. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Your joy is not coming, &gt;&gt; it's arrived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your victory is not going to show up one day. is here now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God heals in many ways. &gt;&gt; We believe that doctors help people. I believe that God heals by medicine. &gt;&gt; God heals by surgery. &gt;&gt; But God heals by understanding. &gt;&gt; So as the word's being preached &gt;&gt; and understanding is striking the soul, &gt;&gt; healing is taking place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Understanding is changing. Understanding is bringing love. Love is activating the third pole. &gt;&gt; It's a word revival, friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not shouting because I feel like it. &gt;&gt; I'm shouting because the word has returned. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Whatever source it is, it's God that heals. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm the Lord that health all thy diseases. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like music. &gt;&gt; You know, God heals by music. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; God heals by music. God heals by love. &gt;&gt; God heals by medicine. God heals by prayer. &gt;&gt; God has many ways of healing. Depends on what type you need. Come on. &gt;&gt; Sometimes a little love &gt;&gt; stretched out. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't know how far your hugs go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord likes it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Can I share? Me and Brother Ray had a moment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just a hug. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Turned into a visitation of an angel. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He inhabits love. &gt;&gt; And how can he love? How could God embrace you? &gt;&gt; God heals by that. There's many ways of healing. Sometimes little love will just cure an old sore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An old place where there's been a grudge or something. It'll heal it right over. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Just a little love, &gt;&gt; a little care. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been struggling with somebody in your life. Why don't you ask the Lord, "Create in me a care." &gt;&gt; Create in me a care. Sometimes when you feel all down, as we call it, just a street expression down in the dump seat. Just put on one of those tapes. &gt;&gt; I'll say this, maybe sometimes the best thing you can do when you're feeling down in the dumps is put on a tape. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Cuz God heals in there. &gt;&gt; God heals in that music. God heals in that preaching. &gt;&gt; God heals through that word. &gt;&gt; Might just be a little grain of sand. But when that little grain of sand, you stand on it. It's not like the rock of Jialter. It's the rock of ages. &gt;&gt; Stand there and you will feel the sound of abundance of rain. You are God's child. Satan has put that affliction upon you. And you know what? And Christ has already healed every one of you. &gt;&gt; This is a vindicated word prophet. &gt;&gt; Christ has already healed every one of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus has already paid the price. And in the sight of God, you are already healed. There's no sickness in the sight of God. Every sinner here inside out, wherever you are, all your sins are, as far as God is concerned, are forgiven now. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed &gt;&gt; with his presence? &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed that the Messiah has come in this age? &gt;&gt; I just took an hour and a half to tell you scriptures you knew front and back. But it identifies he's here now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's here amongst in the midst of his people. And I saw one in the midst of them. Right. &gt;&gt; In the middle of their situation, in the middle of their sickness. Oh, he cares. &gt;&gt; He cares. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He cares enough to come down. &gt;&gt; And change hearts and change lives. Turn situations around. Open blinded eyes that they could see. &gt;&gt; Open ears to hear. &gt;&gt; Oh, how much he cares. This is it, friend. &gt;&gt; He couldn't go no further to reveal this secret. At that time, it had already been revealed when the spirit come upon him and said, "Pick up your pen and write, "This is the secret, Nathan." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the great mystery, friend. &gt;&gt; The son of man has returned in authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are standing on holy ground. And I know that there are angels all around. Let us pray. Won't you stand with us? Jesus for we are standing in his presence on holy ground. Yes, we are standing. And I know that there are Jesus. Oh, we are standing and we are standing in his presence of holy He is here. Hallelu. He is here. He is here.
