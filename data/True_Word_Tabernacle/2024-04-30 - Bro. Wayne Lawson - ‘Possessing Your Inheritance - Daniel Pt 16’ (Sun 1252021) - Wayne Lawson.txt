========================================

Jesus Jesus Jesus there's just something about that name he's my master say Savior [Music] Jesus like a fragrance after the rain as brother Wayne comes this morning to bring the word let's call on his name Oh my Jesus Jesus Jes Jesus let all Heaven and Earth Proclaim Kings and Kingdom oh they shall all pass away but there's something oh about that name Jesus my Jesus oh Jesus there's just something about that name he's my master oh Master saor Jesus like a fragrance after the rain [Music] oh Jesus Jesus Jesus let all Heaven and Earth Proclaim [Music] King and Kingdom will all pass away but there's something [Applause] about that name amen what a powerful name amen a name that's above every name amen and I want to say God bless you this morning certainly good to be in the house of the Lord and good to see everyone out this morning want to welcome all of our visitors God bless you and I know it's a special day today we're having baptism we've uh been having baptism after baptism of the spirit and the water uh it's been a it's been a real Revival around here for a while it seemed like a baptism every week and amen and we just want to thank God for that it's a it's a powerful thing to see the spirit of the Lord moving on the young people and uh and we've seen the water baptisms and we've seen the Holy Ghost baptisms and I think it was last fall or last year some point I think there was about nine young people received the Holy Ghost within about three three or four Services there consecutive one behind the other and it's a it's a powerful thing in this generation to see amen the wicked doing wickedly but the righteous they shall understand and be moved into the things of God Amen want to uh just this morning take a moment from the book of Daniel uh but I would like to if we could just to have a word of prayer before we approach the word we'd like to approach the author of the word and if you would with me this morning with your hearts bow let's just approach him a moment father it is such an honor to stand here today before your children and Lord we we see a great moving of the Holy Ghost among your church Lord your Prophet said that this revival would be so small that the Pentecostal world would miss it but it would be you Lord it would be you and the attribute of that former and latter rain being poured out to bring a a rapturing faith into the church and Lord we see it our eyes Lord have been opened to understand that it's you Lord and we ask you this morning may you give us of your mercy and your grace and Lord may you bless this meeting with your presence for truly Lord we understand that we are not worthy of your presence Lord we're not worthy to stand before your people we have Lord nothing that we have done that is good we just men but Lord while we stand under the power of this blood under the Redemption of your work Lord we confess our worthiness as we stand on your promises and we ask you this morning as we invite you to come Lord that you may move Lord not just up on a good will but to fulfill your word and your word is laying here as a promise before us Lord that every enemy would have to flee at the name and the mentioning of your name that healing would come and Lord the Holy Ghost baptisms would come and Redemption would come and Lord Joy would move and and we just invite you to come take your word take your Liberty Among Us Lord and as you move Lord we'll give you the right away and we ask you to bless it Lord in any good thing we'll give you all the glory and the honor in Jesus name we pray amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles uh we'd like to return to the Book of Daniel and I'm want to look in the 11th chapter here and uh I know you're beginning to wonder if I know there's any other scriptures in the Bible but uh but I I I do I do Daniel 11 and want to read here from 32nd verse uh we're going to be moving from this on into uh that I I've been wanting to get to something for a little bit and we've been building into it so in Daniel 11 and 32 I want to read again and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits uh we Thursday night reread the quote from Feast of trumpets brother Bram really uh says it a little differently the same way but brings understanding when he said the bride shall know her mate the revealed word so the people should know their God so he replaced people with bride brought it to you and then he said God and he explained that that is the revealed word in the age if you look in Daniel 12 we'll read it here um you can read it in the ninth verse and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed and sealed up to the time of the end of course this is also Revelations 10 but many shall be purified and made wide and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand amen but the wise shall understand the spirit of wisdom released upon the church amen we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated this morning and I want to uh just take for a few minutes today from this uh same thought the exploits of faith and I don't know what number it actually is uh I've switched in my personal notes to milk honey and Giants uh so I've been on that I've been on that in my personal study a little bit milk honey and Giants and some of you that wasn't here brother brma actually says that milk and milk and honey he said that's a Pentecostal cocktail amen for the church and and so uh I know there's milk and honey over there but then we found out the Giants were the bread amen you need something to spread some honey on and there's some bread over in that land and it was Giants amen for the for the calebs and and so uh we just want to take a few minutes this morning on the exploits of faith and um I I left you here Thursday night with a with a little bit of something we had found in the book of Ephesians uh when we were studying and showing how uh that of course Caleb and Joshua of the last day of Joshua being the end time messenger and the Caleb being the end time believer who fully followed the word of the Lord and Caleb was one who substained and he didn't faint uh but he went on and crossed into the Promised lands amen and having uh crossed into the land he was uh wanting his mountain and we found that that mountain was a mountain of promise it was something that God had promised him through Moses so he had a title deed to that promise it was the word of a prophet and as long as you have God's word on something you've got a right to stand on that word amen and dispute any other claim or anybody that's on it or anybody says you can't have it you got a right to dispute everything if you've got a prophet's word on it no matter what anyone else says you have a right to dispute what they're saying amen and this inheritance of course that was given to him by promise we found Caleb was a gentile and he come through the tribe of Judah which was a beautiful thought I believe because also did Tamar and or excuse me Ruth and Rahab also through the line of Judah and that's how they found their inheritance of course typing the Gentile bride who would find their inheritance in Christ through the tribe of Judah because of the great king amen the lion the tribe of Judah Christ it made a way for the Gentile Church to come into the atonements and the promises and and Paul trying to introduce this to the church in the book of Ephesians which is a book that parallels the Book of Joshua he said we have obtained an inheritance and amen I thought it was powerful we have obtained an inheritance he used the word we when he was speaking to the Gentile church so Paul and the Gentile church he was saying we amen I like that amen Paul didn't say I he said we amen that we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will Ephesians 1:11 this word inheritance in Ephesians 1:11 is different than it's it's the same English word that's used in the rest of the book of Ephesians but the Greek word behind this word in inheritance is a little different because it talks about the casting of lots uh and of course this being the casting of lots and it takes you back to the Book of Joshua when Joshua moved into the promise that they divided an inheritance of course by lot and and this inheritance brother Rand has quite a bit to say about it and I think it's a powerful thing for the church to know what our inheritance is to understand our inheritance inheritance is something you didn't earn an inheritance is something that was given you and is given to you generally by parents of course the legal uh uh idea of inheritance actually speaks of parents and children it's actually an inheritance and and the prophet says an adoption book amen I thought it was a a good place to find it was in the adoption book he said brother Neville forgive me for taking time on this word inheritance he said but it's My Kinsman I hope I'm not crazy he said but an inheritance we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something he said see God before the foundation of the world left you something he left a name written on the Lamb's Book that when the lamb would be slain you'd be recognized with it amen God left you something and the greatest thing that he could leave you is your name on the Lamb's Book of Life there's nothing there's no greater inheritance in the world than your name on the Lamb's Book of Life you know your name being on the Lamb's Book of Life you you realize amen that sin canot be attributed to a name on the Lamb's Book of Life how many realizes that there's no place to write sin on the Lamb's Book of Life one of the greatest Revelations about the Lamb's Book of Life is it's only a list of names there's no there's no place to put an account of sin so a name left on the Lamb's Book of Life amen shows there's no place see it's just a place for a name you ever fill out something your name's a little too long and you run out of and there's no other place it's just that little place there there's nothing just that place and and God made a place just put it for the names that way amen that nothing could be added to the name because that was a name on the Lamb's Book of Life so the life that you're accounted for is the life of the Lamb it's not actually your natural life it's your spiritual life that come through the blood of Jesus Christ so there's not a better inheritance in the world than your name on the Lamb's Book of Life them people on the Lamb's Book of Life I'll tell you what a prophet said he said your name was put in there by the indelible ink of the blood and it can't be taken off I like that part amen I know some people people probably would remove my name if they could but thank God Amen they ain't got any access to that book this morning amen and if they did get access to it Amen brother R said it's put in the blood amen and they couldn't change it if they wanted to thank God this morning amen it's written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen where there cannot be anything accounted where it's written in the indelible ink how many knows that them in the Lamb's Book are those that which will go in the Rapture of the church absolutely this is separating time isn't it amen and the prophet reads it from Galatians the 4th chapter when he speaks about us being Heir amen I think it's powerful he speaks about us being Heir there's a great separation there uh galatian chapter 4 if you want to pull it up I think it's the 26 27th verse galatian chapter 4 speaking of of uh Abraham's uh two uh uh two sons it speaks of both of of Ishmael from Hagar and speaks of Isaac who come from Sarah and one brother random reads it he actually brings us into a message seed not air the shirt was you able to pull it up amen he said it's re written Rejoice thou baren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travail us not for the children for the desolate have many more children than she which hath a husband and what's that next verse now we Brethren as Isaac are the children of Promise amen amen but as then that were born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so is it now Amen brother Bram as a few pre verses to it when he preaches it but in see not air with the shook he reads the scripture that deals with us being hirs to God but our Heir is through a promise just like Isaac was air we are air but we're air through a promise amen and then the prophet says see amen it's got to be separated Isaac and Ishmael was separated and so is the bride in the church it's got to be separated in the last day how many knows where the separation comes the prophet said here's the Separation The Bride will not be going through judgment according to John 5 and: 24 she has believed the word and bypass judgment by doing so amen but he said according to first Thessalonians 4 she'll be the rapturing church he said but over in Revelations 20 the Bible said the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years so there's a separating point between the seed and the hus or between the bride and the church you find it again in Matthew 25 when the Bible said there are five foolish virgin and there are five wise virgin there's a separating Point amen and that separation comes because of the predestination of God how many knows brother B said the foolish virgin wise virgin made out of the same material how many knows that it's the same exact material he said the only difference is the pattern was laid over that certain part and you fell within the pattern so your ordination is predestinated of god it's not what you earned amen I want you to realize this morning you you cannot earn your way into this Rapture it is an inheritance of God that is gave to the Church of the Living God well if you can't work your way in then you can't work your way out amen then the devil has lost the battle already this morning and there is a bride ready to go in and the devil can't do anything about it oh God that's shouting grounds this morning for the Church of the Living God we're a we're inheritors of the riches of God because our name was put on there our inheritance because of what because we were predestinated that's a prophet inheritance by predestination we my Armenian Brothers I know that's awful hard and I don't aim to hurt but it just does me so good to know it brother R wasn't fighting with the legalist he just wanted you to know it amen amen this is predestined you can relax a little I I don't mean this to to sound like we want you to go see but you got to quit letting the devil make you think amen that if you do a little something or you feel a certain way that you're all of a sudden somehow put out of the Rapture the devil don't have that kind of power over you Satan don't have that kind of power over the bride of Christ we have another origin we've got another order we have come here by the power of endless life hey when I think about this you say preacher I don't even believe in that predestination amen I know there's many that don't and some people don't even like the church age book because of that because brother bam uses the term elective love well I love the church age book because he uses the term elective love because I know I sure didn't earn no love but if it hadn't been for election where would I be this morning brother B said it's God's election Grace that called you it's God's election Grace that justified you it's God's election Grace if it was not for Grace where would we be this morning oh but the grace of God Amen that made a way where there was no way my grace of God predestinated Romans 8:29 and 30 the Bible said whom he did for know he did also predestinate and I I love that word predestinate I know some people don't like it much but I like it I think it's a rush I think it's a power within the church uh a Thrust would be the better word it's a it's a Thrust amen for the church in the bride time and the bride it's a it's a bride's experience with God and you can't explain it without using this word predestiny I met in Assemblies of God one time and I worked with him a while we we worked together every day and you know how it is you work with somebody every day and we was able to talk a lot during lunch and stuff and he was a Christian I was a Christian so we had a lot to talk about amen but him being an assembly God the first time I realized that some of the message people get their ideas on predestination from the Assemblies of God Amen I know some people were Pentecostal before they were message because when they explain predestination they say just like the Pentecostal say it and this Pentecostal man was talking to me about predestination he saidwell he said I I don't even believe in that predestination I said well do you believe your Bible he said yeah and he had a he had a Bible right here in his front pocket I just reached over and took the Bible out of his front pocket flipped it open to Romans 8 and read him he he did for no he also did predestiny and then I flipped it right over to Ephesians 1 and5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children but Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of the will I said are you sure you don't believe in predestination he said brother I believe in it you just read it out of the Bible amen I tell you what that that's the way I want to change the moment you read it say hey I'm ready to go and if God's wanting to give me predestination why would I want to fight with the grace of God why would I want to struggle and rle against God trying to give me something listen to me Church he's trying to give you Grace he's trying to give you riches he's trying to give you inheritance he's trying to give you promise he's trying to give you Rapture why do you want to work for it he he's already gave it to you that you can begin to shout the grace of God the power of God every devil is defeated every one of them's already lost the battle amen somebody ought to tell the devil this morning it's too late Satan it's too late we've already got the word the grace of God has already reached our hearts what are you going to do with us now I tell you you can't do nothing with a man when he sees this can't do nothing with him he found out Satan cannot change in time what God done in eternity and if that ever strikes your heart you can war with Satan anywhere any place any time because you got it is written it is written glory amen inheritance was by predestination you inherit first brother Bram said inheritance was by predestination I inherited something there had to be something somebody to leave me in inheritance you say Jesus left me in inheritance brother R said beg your pardon he never left the inheritance Jesus never left you he only come and down and paid for your inheritance brought your inheritance but your name was on the Lamb's Book before the foundation of the world God give you an inheritance your inheritance was first he Oh Glory your inheritance was before the blood that's the reason Jesus died I love to read the Bible don't you and the Bible said he was slain before the foundations of the world why was he slain before because your name was written before before the devil young people I think amen you could take this and give the devil a good weapon this morning before there was a devil I had a name on the book before there was sickness or sin before there was a fall before there was a devil to cause a fall my name was already on the land Book of Life I was there in Victory I'm here in Victory but it was every bit of it was by the word of God for years I wondered how was my name written in the Lamb's Book of Life brother Seth I always wondered that one day I was reading brother brandom he's a powerful Prophet you know and he said this he said your name was written by the spoken word I said Oh Glory if it was written by the spoken word then I can read it by the spoken word I can hear it by the spoken word he do you see then you recog ize your name on the book by hearing if it's written by the spoken word you can read it by the spoken word if it was read if it was written in Spanish you could read it in Spanish but since it's written by the spoken word it'll take the spoken word to reveal it is that right since we're since we're this far along we might as well go ahead and say it he been there's been there's been millions of people whose names is on that book I believe it millions of people people redeemed whose name's on that book from the beginning all the way to now but brother Dallas this is the first age that people have knew their name was on that book in every other age it was a guess but according to the breach amen this is the age of the opening of the book and nobody has ever knew whose names were there until this season but here we are brother the book has been open the church has seen its name in the book than the greatest Revival and it ever struck the Earth or to strick our hearts amen I I just have to say it out there people don't like shouting I'm sorry you come to a shouting age he said well the bride used to not shout well they they shouted in the beginning you say this is a new kind of way I don't like this new movement in the bride list it's not a new religion it's actually the oldest religion there is the Bible said job was asked by God himself where were you when the sons of God was shouting for joy and the morning Stars sang together I wonder what kind of song they sang I don't think they sang and old funeral hymn I bet you they sang something that took the sons of God and lifted them off of their seats by the power of God I don't believe in just a bunch of funeral worship I believe the church is a place for life and power and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's time to throw out the formalism and the intellectual and let the power of God come into a church with Revival and truth and [Applause] life I wish I could hear one of them songs this morning I wish I wish God would have told us what songs they were singing but I feel like we I feel like we bump into one once in a while don't you brother Wayne's a little loud for me this morning brother Ram said this is the quietest place you're going to be hey amen you got to take it up with a prophet he said this was the quietest place if you go to hell they're going to be loud if you go to heaven it's going to be loud is that right amen it's just according which way you go but I'd right rather hear the Sons and Daughters of God rejoicing over the Vindicated word in the age and a bunch of people rejoicing and Shout over some ball game or some music thing amen but let the word of God be restored in the church until Victory can come into every heart into every life my I believe it God sent Jesus to save those that he had already chosen already chosen woo Glory my I feel so good I can't hard to read amen that's our inheritance God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price the shedding of his blood that no sin would be be accounted to us nothing you do we better read that again get that and print somebody that no sin would be accounted to us nothing you do well we're not W to go out and do something wrong amen but we were born wrong to begin with and there's a lot of things back there that we're not proud of Amen but God is so M it that Satan cannot hold the past of the Bride to keep them out of the future of a home hey thank God this morning that he claims you he claims you with every problem he claims you with every trouble he cleaned you every bit of the issues you're going through but God cleansed you anyhow because he chose you and saw you before the foundation of the world you talk about lifting power you talk about lifting power this is astronaut fuel This Will Blast the church out into the bride's age with anointing and Power hey let Le de lose its gravity we got enough time to be weary we got enough time to be sad we got enough time to be serious why not let the Holy Ghost take us in a realm we can feel the joy of God we can wash till depression is broken and anxiety leaves the church I don't believe I don't believe we have to be a bound up bunch of people and sin and our history in our past and our trouble I think God has given Liberty when he said by a prophet it's can't be held against you it's not held against you I'm a Believer brother I believe it if a prophet said it I'll stake my life on it now if we preaching against hair women cutting hair or they they're high heels or something like if we preaching like that amen we got to believe a prophet we got to Humble to the prophet but if he switches gears and he comes in there and says that's your word works and God ain't held nothing we got to believe the prophet there the same as we believe him over here the shedding of the blood that no sin would be accounted to us nothing you do amen nothing see see what it was nothing you do he left me an inheritance he put my name on the book amen it's an inheritance amen I got to I got to skip down here and pick something up look what as a prophet was saying this he comes into this of how that Christ comes to the church he said listen he said he come and cut every obstacle from the human beings that they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent don't you believe that he is a man fully surrendered to God and do not does not it say in Mark 11 whatsoever things he should say now look what he's doing he comes in here and says every obstacle has been cut from Man by The Blood every obstacle I think it's powerful every obstacle what what what's he talking about every Obstacle of your past every Obstacle of your birth Every curse of your family every trouble anything that holds you out of the promises of God I I don't want you to forget now I'm talking about in the last day some people going to know their God they're going to know the revealed word and they're going to do exploits those exploit are actions this message is in action this morning with power and demonstration we don't believe in just the word only but we believe there's a Dynamics to this word that brings life and power what good is a dead L it'll kill every one of you but life has come power has come to anoint you and bring you into the Redemptive power and the works of Christ to cut you loose to cut you loose my I feel like it this morning you ever feel like just Cutting Loose you ever just want to cut loose amen just tell the devil I've had enough of you today I've had enough amen I had enough fighting and fussing and arguing and this is right and that's wrong and this over sometimes you just want to cut loose from everything anybody has ever said and just enjoy the word of God let it come into your soul don't let no devil robed you this morning so preacher what are you saying I'm saying cut loose do you know Satan don't even have a claim do you know that Satan don't even have one claim on your life listen I'll give you what a prophet said he don't have a legal right how's that he don't have one legal right to hold you then if there's no legal right he can't hold against you what you have done he can't hold against you what your parents have done then Every curse that was put against the flesh has been broken by the blood and SA Satan has lost the battle by the power of the word ever curse broken God I I tell you I want to get up and run around my room last night I got the reading about this every curse broken you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying Every curse is broken you don't have to live with one of them you don't have to live with one curse from your past one curse from your father from your mother from down through them lines you don't have to live with any of Why Stop short of being a real genuine Christian Why Stop short of a real Liberty in your life why walk around letting the devil hurt you and destroy you and bind you you are children of the Living God and got a r by the power of the Holy Ghost I don't think we ought to stop I think we ought to pick up an ox no like shamgar did and we ought to whip Us 600 Philistines until every one of them's dead until we can eat our harvest in Liberty come on church I'm talking to some calebs this morning I'm talking about some people that says we are more than able to Promise This land to take this Promised Land can can I can I give you what I'm looking at amen 600 Philistines kept them from eating in Liberty didn't it robed The Inheritance but when shangar got tired he whipped 600 Philistines so he could eat his own harvest in Liberty it didn't belong to the Philistines what business did they have of taking it or giving it or anything to do with it and that'll that'll Philistine of the curse of your past has no right in the Church of the Living God robbing you from The Inheritance that God has set upon your life amen I was I was preaching about this over to Youth Camp in in Arizona here a while back this spring and it just struck me amen that after shenar whip 599 why would he stop with only one to go it just start why would a man put down his ox nood and walk off and leave one standing why not just go ahead and do it why stop short of the one Why Stop short of just one little spirit let one little thing creep around with you because your mama your daddy your parents somebody had to come on it's time to rid the hurch of The Temper Spirit and the old arrogance and stubbornness and let the power of God strip every bit of it off of you until life accelerates through you you said brother Wayne I don't know if I can do that let me tell you something amen Jesus went all the way so can you you know what I'm talking about he went all the way didn't he he was going up Calgary's Hill and he was falling under the load he could have stopped there brother Dallas it could have been too hard amen but amen he was carrying something up that hill he was carrying the curse for the Bible said cursed is he that hangeth on the tree he was carry in their own tree to hang the curses of your life on that tree that you wouldn't have to bear them through your life's journey that the curse could stop at the cross my when he climbed up brother when he climbed up on Calvary and he spread out his arms and he began to die he died until every sin Was Defeated he died till every devil was ripped he died till Every curse was broken he did not leave one curse to represent or to haunt the Church of the Living God so you ain't got to live with it this morning I got news for you shake somebody beside you and tell them the curse has been broken off of your life W the curse has been broken you don't have to have a temper anymore you don't have to be arrogant anymore you don't have to be stubborn anymore you don't have to be passionate amen come on Church some men are born under their passion and they wore with it their whole life it keeps them from serving God but this morning don't you let that devil beat you again rise up and tell the devil you lost this morning Satan glory to God build up a fire and throw every devil in it strip it come on you're to be stripped of all husk you're the seed oh yeah curses amen but think about it think about it it's to be broken Jesus died till they were all broken so you can die till they're all broken you don't have to live with one of them this morning amen now I know Satan would like to keep it around but if if hey if I was him I would too but you don't have to accept it amen because you have an inheritance I love how brother Bram says this he said God sent his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what he said inheritance to sunship to be a Son of God brother to an inheritance to be a Son of God to be a daughter of God God that's what you're predestinated to be I I I want to maybe sometimes I I'd like to just switch gears and preach another sermon I'm not going to do it to you this morning but I'll say this to you God never made a halfway son God never made a fallen son God never made a fallen daughter come on church amen God didn't make the caterpillar he made the butterfly you know I'm telling you the truth he made the finished work amen caterpillar is only on his way to a butterfly amen and you as the church redeemed is on your way to the fullness of adoption which is the changing of our body that's where we're going and no devil can keep us out of that but now we are the sons of God we're not going to be just in the Millennium we are already the sons of God we have an inheritance don't you let no curse rob you from that don't you let no devil rob you out of that well you can't be just now see what he's trying to is Satan trying to keep you out of it and I would if I was him because if this bride ever really sees who she is and what God has done for her Satan's had it now I I'll tell you what brother Ram says adoption part four if that's good for you it's good for me he said this may choke you to death he said but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods brother men that are sons of God are amateur Gods how many how ever know anything about that how many knows that Jesus said so how many knows Jesus said so he said you were an amateur God I'll read it to you brother bam is referring to the book in John 10:34 Jesus answered said is it not written in your law that you are gods and if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came to and the scripture cannot be broken he said Jesus said is it not written in your law so Jesus said your Gods but he was quoting the scripture that said you were Gods he was quoting Psalms 82 and verse 6 I have said you are gods and all of you are the children of the most high I said you are God Psalm said it John said it now brother brandom in the end times picking it up and saying the same thing amen according to Genesis 1 when God created man he created man to have dominion is that right Dominion Dominion do he's given us Dominion that's why you are called a king and a priest and you have been given dominion and that Dominion is over sin over the Flesh and over the devil you are already in a Dominion with a king amen now that might choke you but it's the truth watch what brother bam says he said which God said in Genesis 2 that you were Gods had full dominion over the Dominion of the world he gave you dominion over all things he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his Dominion Satan took it over but brother we're waiting for the manifestation of sons who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when sons of God are manifested in the power of God will walk out and will take every Power Satan's got away from him you said brother that's over in the Millennium I beg you pardon there's some Believers today taking every Power Satan's got away from him he said how you doing it come on if you were fighting over land in this world we're living you take it to the court that has judgment over that is that right and you don't take it with a gun you take it by the law and in the Church of the Living God brother R said the scripture is where we take the power away from the devil we bring him back to the word Jesus said it is written it is written and made Saint and Powerless before her and the Church of the Living God can take the word and go back and take Satan making him powerless with the church adoption four brother man said he's the logos that went out of God is that true that was a Son of God then he made man a little God and if he called them who's God who's the word of the Lord come to them are gods and God said to himself he were Gods I made you a God made Aaron your Prophet I may act like a religious crank but I'm not when your eyes come open and you begin to see these things he made man a god a God in his dominion and a domain goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he has control of it and when Jesus came being the one God without sin he proved it when he said to the winds peace be still and to the tree he cursed it no man eat of you anymore then he turned I love it I love how Jesus ministered the Dominion into the church look at this Jesus exercised it when he spoke to the tree and cursed the tree didn't he brother R is saying it he said Adam lost it Jesus exercised it uh god without sin he showed peace be still curse the tree remember the Dead the lame the halt the blind everything he took power over it and showed the Dominion that he had in the spiritual world then he said unto them the minute they saw that Dominion he turned and said verily I say unto you well Glory verily I say unto you who's that you come on now I'll tell you what brother brandom says verily I say unto you he said that's little Gods verily I say unto you little Gods if you say under this mountain and be moved amen don't doubt it in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass and you will have it see that was the logos that come out of God when it become flesh how many realizes he says now now the same logos has a part he has got a bride that same logos the word that cannot be tampered with it's now brooding over the church today trying to bring it back the word to its full manifestation this word is not trying to make a scholar out of you it's trying to bring you into manifesting truth into manifesting Power amen the manifestation of the word that's what the whole world is looking for the sons of God to manifest the word I can read it to you Romans 8 you know the scripture says it the whole earth granth waiting for the manifestation of sons uh sometimes it helps you if you put a different word there as brother randomly use it use the word attribute if you can't take manifested son what about manifested attribute that's a good one didn't it he said then the bride was an attribute in the mind of God before and now and now they're being manifested so we are the manifested attributes of God well you you are the manifested sons of God manifested Sons this is what the whole world has been waiting on the manifestation of those Sons brother bam says it like this he says see he says now for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen I I I I like to to bring you sometimes where brother bam says something bring it straight out he said this is the day of the manifestation of sons of God when the Mysteries that that's been hid since the foundation of the world is to be made known this is the hour brother this is the hour adoption paragraph 80 go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's ready for moving of what for the manifestation of sons when true Sons born Sons filled Sons my that's that's three sermons isn't it amen when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and the word is backed I believe we're on the border of it right now say to this mountain amen now watch this we're talking about Caleb going into the lands of Promise here we show you strictly that the spoken word is a promise of the church and the only thing that will hold you out of it is the curse of sin that you hold in your own hearts the curce of sin you holding your own mind God has paid the price God has opened the Jordan God has sent leadership to take you in amen this morning the Bible said they did not go in because of unbelief but in our hearts this morning there's a reality that sin can no longer hold the church out of its position God has answered sin in this hour and here we are in such an hour and such a Time amen if you go to Romans the 8th chapter we'll read this Amen to take the scripture to back us a little bit here Romans the 8th chapter you can just read it I think it's a a powerful reading amen uh if we look here in the 14th verse for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear oh my amen what was Caleb dealing with back there they was dealing with with the fear of the Giants it wasn't the land wasn't theirs it wasn't that God had made a promise for the land that they themselves were under bondage and fear was their bondage think of this today we have not been given the spirit to fear this God has not given us a spirit to fear the Dominion and the power and the Redemption and the sons of God he's not given us the spirit to fear it how many knows where fear first come in the Bible it come in the Bible when Adam sinned the first time fears mentioned Adam see the next thing you know he's hiding from God and and and the only reason he's hiding is because of a fear from the sin he committed if there's no sin then there's no fear come on Church the Bible said perfect love casteth out fear and you cannot have perfect faith without having perfect love because as long as fear is there there is no perfect Faith but this is the age of the promise of perfect faith God has promised to the church not perfect faith in the Millennium yes we will have it in the Millennium but what do we need with it in the Millennium we need it now we need Miracles today we need Sons and Daughters of God today my goodness when I I think about this I think about the hour that we're living without this word what hope would we have in the face amen of inflation the face of all the distur distances and the troubles and the plagues and the sicknesses and the trials where would we be if this message hadn't give us this kind of Faith come on now we're talking about faith Beyond we're talking about faith Beyond just believing we're talking about something moving in from ability to God will he said preacher what are you saying can I give you an example in scripture amen it's Nehemiah right amen the three Hebrew children powerful Testament in scripture when they start going in the fiery furnace remember remember what happened the king says to them if you'll bow we won't put you in there and them Hebrew children said we're not careful to answer the Old King remember that we're not careful to answer the Old King and then what they said for our God is able to deliver us brother Bram said see the reason he said our God is able he said because there was no promise that he would he said but look how far they got with just knowing their God was able to do it he said but today we're not just standing here saying that God is able to do it we're standing on a promise of God that has been Vindicated in the age we're living in I'm not talking about something that has not been done but I'm talking about living in an age where a prophet has manifested the spoken word over the church to tell you that God by the blood has took the curse off that the church could speak by the power of the word brother brother brother brother I say like Caleb of oh give me this mountain give me the mountain of the Statue of a perfect man give me the mountain of true sons of God give me the mountain of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of the spoken word oh I know I know I've done faced all the Giants in that land brother BR brother R was one did that you think you're brother Bram amen I I tell you what I challenge you on that statement right quick you said preacher what are you talking about I challenge you say brother Ram didn't do it tell me what man ever created anything I challenge you that Jesus Christ is not dead I say that he's alive and if there was any creating done it wasn't the man William brandom that did it it was God that did it through the channel of the blood and stepped into a mortal body and spoke it Oh Glory to God Brother s if he done it once He'll Do It Again amen if God did it one time he'll do it again every time I say something like that somebody say well brother Wayne are you creating squirrels and I tell them all the time well I'm not squirrel hunting I don't mean it to be arrogant but if they're going to be stupid might as well answer them you know amen it ain't nothing different than the man at the cross bring yourself down if you can save us Jesus wasn't trying to get down because the word had already said he would die and we're not trying to showbo for anybody we're trying to say there's a land of the power of the spoken word and it belongs to the Church of the Living God it's our land oh brother you ain't creating no squirrels well I'm not squirrel hunting either but I tell you what I am doing I am preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and as an amateur God I have been told by a prophet that I could take the word and speak the word and it's the same as deity speaking and the creative power of the word word of God will move down into the church that's why sicknesses can be healed while you're preaching the gospel that's why lame can get up and walk oh we're on we're on squirrel hunting we're in church come on we might as well go ahead and say it haven't we you are a God how many knows that honestly you are a God if you're if you're not redeemed you're a fallen God if you're a redeemed you're a redeemed God put back where you come from is that right brother B said then you are a Creator an amateur one but you're a Creator and brother B said we have a power to create atmospher what a time to remind the church in a leoan world when everybody's mind is on houses and cars and work and now on Co and vaccines and all kinds of things out here in this world well I tell you here's one mind that refuses to let my mind stay on such nonsense all the time every day amen let this mind be in you I was also in Christ Jesus come on Church the prophet said it shall come to pass in the last days that you so think like the mind of Christ that he should bring to pass the thought of your mind can you imagine that you maybe sometimes won't even speak it but you'll be thinking it and the spirit of God will get a hold of your thought and creative anointing will come upon that thought and it will begin to manifest right among you you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying every one of you is a Creator right here every one of you is your creator I'll tell you what you got you got a power to open up your mouth and say Amen to the word of God you don't have to be a preacher to do it you don't have to be an elder to do it you can be a woman you can be a man a child every man and woman got a right to say Amen to the word of God and when you begin to amen the word it creates an anointing around the word and brings the power of what's being spoken back in your life come on now I got enough scripture stacked up here for a month to prove my point come on you know how to write only thing she did not rich not intelligent not understanding no money no class no Society no clicks no church nobody but a prophet sitting at the table woo and he looked at her and told her a story about creative power coming through human lips and she just put a little Amen in there come on mother come on mother you got a right to amen the same as anybody else got a right to amen the word and when she amened it brother Ram said a super anointing came in the building she created that anointing now there's not enough time to go there but you know what I'm talking about it was a creative anointing super anointing brother B said greater than when he spoke the squirrels is when he spoke back to her through her amen that's why amen sometimes that when you read oh God that's fresh off the gridle brother R sometimes you read a quote and when they read it back in the days in Jeffersonville it didn't cause a big Ruckus but you read that quote to this bride in this generation and with the understanding she has and it's got a greater anointing on it now that when the prophet spoke it back there he wasn't speaking it for that group he was speaking it for this end time church that's come to an anointing in the last day it's a greater anointing it's a greater work it's a greater time Glory we have come to the age you don't have to wait on it anymore it's your hour it's your season it's your day and when you begin to amen the word creative anointing enters into the building I'm not crazy I'm not crazy do you know the brother Ram said that you be electrified by his presence electrified that's powerful ain't it he said I am the vine and you are the branch he said every Branch will be energized from the vine he said every office of it will be electrified he said you'll be his mouth his ears his his nose his his feet he said it'll be God whether you're preaching the word or seeing a vision it'll still be God and the people will be electrified by the presence of God and the people shall be electrified by the presence of God have you ever been in a service that's just electrifying it's an electrifying presence a Prophet prophesied come on church he prophesied that when we repr preach the message of the hour it would Electrify the Church of the Living God sometimes you feel like you got a a vote of lightning running through your body somebody asked me one time said brother Wayne why do you get so excited I'll tell you why amen cuz sometimes when you're preaching the word it's more than just some scriptures going out there's a life going out of you there's a life going out of you I've been preaching and watch people begin theophan ising that's a good word ain't it I made it up amen it's the brother brother brandom said when you hear the word and recognize it you heard from your theophany right and then he says that glorified bodies right here in the building he said that amen and it's like a battery that's the positive and the negative so when you come the positive comes in contact with the negative as a charge of electricity that comes into the church preaching this message ought to be a charge of the anointing of the Holy Ghost with power and manifestation to Electrify all I say Brothers hook me up Glory let the the power come let the anointing flow let life changing experience coming to the church I had enough dead Services I want the power of God I want the reality of God to fall into the church with an anointing and with truth brother Wayne what are you talking about I'm I'm in the message now brother bam talking about a little boy was healed with cancer right in front of the right in front of the service there little boy healed with cancer leukemia exactly and he comes in there and says it took a creative work from God to change that blood cell and to cleanse that boy in the amount of hours the leukemia was gone he called it a creative work and you said preacher why would you say that I was over Norway a few years ago I was preaching this message he'll Billy me preaching the message of the hour just laying scripture on top of scripture and letting the anointing come and I said the seven star of the Book of Revelations there a man named William brandom an anointing fell in the building an electrifying anointing a woman in the back been sick with lukemia for years A year later come and hooked me up and said brother Lawson while you were preaching that word there was an anointing fell on me a heat started in the top of my head went to the bottom of my feet I am completely healed of leukemia what was it it was a creative work it was a creative work come on if created back there amen when did God ever change when did God ever change the only thing changed was the curse of sin that come on the church but the blood broke the curse now brother Ram says it he says it very well I love how he says things he actually says it would would Electrify amen here's here's here's one part he says it like this and you I quoted that paragraph 183 the word became flesh in India he said a great wonderful church will go forth in the power of deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind brother bam has a creative power who just healed uh leukemia you know what he says next the very next thing he says that one paragraph the next thing he says he says I believe I'm not going to speak it in his name I'm going to speak it in my revelation of Faith what happened in seeno Canyon the other day I believe the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the Creator I believe if he can make a squirrel appear a man or a woman has a missing part what about a complete animal said preacher are you putting out a challenge I'm not putting out a challenge I'm putting out a promise and I'm saying it's our land I'm saying it's our inheritance and I ain't going to let no long neck gick keep me out of it I'm not going to let no uncircumcised Philistine that has no Covenant with God say that it's not possible it is possible all things are possible with God I know I know people say a man a woman lost her nose for a surgery they asked brother Bram said brother Bram is it possible that her nose could be regrouped he said it's not only possible it's probable he said a few months later I saw the woman and her nose had been completely repaired God grew a new no listen to me friends I tell you there's still a God and he's still powerful and he's still real and in this Ley and age where they ground that every promise of God God still has a way to hook things up to bring electricity back into the lives of every believer I tell you this amen the god that created the first squrrel he's God that can do another [Music] one he can do whatever he wants to he can create he can do anything the very God the creative life he says if you're a prisoner you can speak till it speaks and when you spoke it'll be God's word I'll skip down here the very God that made the Frog the first time the second frog he makes all frogs you see what I mean he made the first squirrel he makes the second squirrel he makes any squirrel he can make anything he wants to he is God he is God he is life and when I think of it it makes me shiver so what are you saying I'm saying the first God that made the squirrel in the beginning is the god that makes the second squirrel and the god that made your body is the same God that can add a limb back to your body come on some of you not amen not missing a hand this morning amen but some of you missing faith and that faith is what you need you need the hand of Faith to reach out and get a hold of the sword of God but just as God could create a natural Lim so can God create the hand of Faith he can put Faith back where there is no faith where your life has took Faith out of you let the word restore you this morning back to the faith of God to take the hand of Faith pick the sword up and go to fight long next again we not been put here to sit in our rocking chairs and watch things go by we're the children of God these are the promises of God and the whole world is waiting for you to move into your inheritance so brother Wayne can we make a mountain move brother Ram said Jesus was pointing at the Mount of Olives when you're a Son of God and you receive God which is zoee God's own life then you become a part of God we can stack a few of these quotes up can't we there's plenty of them you know that man could not move a mountain just by speaking to it the only thing that could do that would be deity if a mountain is before and our objective right our motive is right then it isn't us speaking anymore it's deity speaking then it has to move amen deity speaking you deity speaking the word comes into you if the holy spirit's in there it say alive as soon as it comes in therefore if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt it in your heart because what you are deity speaking you believe that the Bible said so whatsoever thing shall come to pass if you don't doubt it if you can make get all of the world breed out of you let the Holy Spirit make you a full son or daughter of God my hey man you brother when have we get deity in US anyhow sister Faith he said the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity when you say I got the Holy Ghost it means he tabernacled deity in you come on now you are not just mechanics then you are the Temple of the dynamics of God it's electrifying you become the Temple of his electricity that flows from the word through you and a spoken power that comes into the church when a spirit my amen when a spirit comes into his life amen what happens that Spirit takes you I know this is these are shocking quotes these are these are quotes that rattle your Humanity deity is not in heaven deity is in you come on Caleb run the giant off of that ground the minute that I say that watch how many things come to you this problem that situation that failing that fell where you fa last month where this situation when you was a kid how this happened those things nobody knows all that stuff comes up in the face of that quote it ain't nothing but a giant it's a giant of vanac to keep you off the mountain of the spoken word but I say unto you in the name of the Lord sin has lost its curse Jesus broke the power of it and sent the Holy Ghost back on the church to defeat every devil to defeat every giant you don't think that he didn't know these Giants would be here Amen brother random says it speaking of this subject he said it was no it was no uh it was no mystery of how Luther stood against the C church he said the mystery is how did he outlive the fanaticism that followed it come on church and whenever a prophet released this spoken word revelation to the church every Fanatic in the country picked it up until now when you try to preach it to the church amen even good people amen let those giants take a stronghold in their lives and say that's for another generation that's for another people that's for another time but that's a lie that's a lie the devil it's for now it's for you it's for this generation I know Amen in this hour that you're living amen the prophet makes it clear deity is not in heaven it's in you that deity Amen brother sister that deity is in you amen we are not worshiping I love how he says it a little while and the world see me no more but you shall see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you we're not worshiping Christ in the manger go ahead and get your nativity scene get the baby out of the crib we're not worshiping him in a crib we are not worshiping him in a Manger we are worshiping him after the death burial and Resurrection he's not a baby in a Manger this morning he's a mighty conqueror and he's in the heart of the Church of a living God Christ is not dead he's here he's here in power within proof after infallible proof it's time to run some devils out of town come on church amen fire and feather that devil and run him out of your life this morning Satan you can't have this ground you can't have this I belong to the Lord and the Lord belongs to me enough of it already energized electrified I love that quote brother Ram says electrified cuz he actually makes another quote he said we're on the borderline I love how he uses borderline we're talking about Caleb we're on the borderline he said with the sons of God will speak the word and it'll flash like lightning you talk about a bunch of Thunder amen but I'll tell you it produces lightning I don't have time preach on this morning but there's a there's a scientific phrase I wish one of you guys would help me if you remember throw it out there but it's actually used for thunder and lightning it's actually a phrase used for thunder and lightning you don't have to see lightning amen if you hear the thunder lightning somewhere it's a it's a phrase I forget the phrase I've learned it from but it's a phrase an English phrase if you hear the thunder the Lightning's there if you see the lightning you don't even have to hear the thunder see it's thundering somewhere if there's lightning and if there's a thunder there's lightning god don't have thunder without lightning come on church he didn't release seven Thunders in this age without an electricity that would come back in the church but the Thunders revealed something it revealed that Christ was not in a tomb Christ is not in a Manger it revealed that Christ had descended into the Church of the Living God separated us from the church into the bride and now the bride becomes a tabernacle of the deity of almighty God my I think it's time I think it's time to cut loose I think it's time to cut loose from the fear and the spirit of bondage it's time to cut loose from all the Heritage and the curses and the doctrines and the ideas it's time just to cut loose of everything the power of this Blood you preachers preach it and we believe it all of us love it the power of the blood but there's something that something that that's that's so real to me personally to this is a personal reality is that the power of the blood before before the cross you know the power of the blood was that they took sins from the time of Adam all the way to Calvary and when the blood came all of that sin was erased Jesus did in three days what they couldn't do in millions of gallons of blood and ritual throughout the ages he erased and eradicated every evidence and power of sin to give the people a liberty is't that powerful amen so people say well amen that that's what the cross did but the cross is more powerful than that the blood has much more power than that because here we are 2,000 years after the cross and sins that were not even committed yet he eradicated them 2,000 years ago and reached into the future and said sin you're so defeated that you'll not be able to reach my children they'll be 2,000 years the other side of the Cross but Christ through the cross will have the power to eradicate every one of them amen now I I I I I think it goes real deep now you're easily going to receive the idea that when you got saved all your sin disappeared the day you got saved all your sin disappeared I was on this a little Thursday night all your sins disappear right but after the cross see that's where Satan gets you after you become a Christian after you become a committed person to God if you do anything if you say anything if you have any failure see there you blasphemed God see there you can't get no forgiveness see but what Satan fails to know is the power of that cross because the cross had the power to take all the sin before you become a Christian but it has the same power to take away all the sin as long as you're on this Earth God gave the blood to keep Satan from being able to get hold of you we could take it another level if you want to watch the watch the watch the Old Testament Saints when they come up and when Jesus comes he sets all the things straight Paul comes in teaches all the doctrine but then look at all the doctrine after Paul look at all the things they added after Paul preached look at all the things they added but when the message of the hour comes through the power of the blood it literally takes off of you every false doctrine that has ever been put on the church when you first came to the message come on church and then somebody got a hold of you and they started putting you this way and putting you that way and little things started being added to you but the same God that saved you is the same God that can take off every feeling every situation every trial every Doctrine anything any man ever said come on bride pick up your sword this morning and take off the head of anoch and his children and these Giants that have moved into this land long too long have we allowed Giants to possess blessings and promises that belongs to us brother Wayne what are you saying I'm saying it's time to cut loose Amen brother brandom says it like this amen a man who fully surrendered to God is omnipotent and Mark 11 says so next time you read Mark 11 where it says if you say unto this mountain be thou moved you read it the way he read it man is omnipotent isn't that something that's what brother brandom got from that scripture if you say under this mountain be moved man is omnipotent he is all powerful brother B said if man is omnipotent and God is omnipotent then you get them two together without any hindrances in there you get them two together without any hindrance of what this guy said and what this guy said and what this situation said and who did this and who did that and I did this and my dad did that and if you get all of that hindrance out of there and you connect an omnipotent man to an omnipotent god brother Adam said it like this then the atomic bomb is not the most powerful thing on the earth he said it's a Believer who's in contact with his maker no wonder Satan wants to keep something between you and the message or you and everything that God has anointed your life listen to me you are more powerful than an adom bomb can I say this to y'all this morning I think it's time to go off on the devil I think it's time to just blow up on the devil just blow up on him amen make it such a amen I I don't know how deep them bombs reach or how far out they go but I know you don't want to be close at all amen the repercussion from that thing is felt from miles and miles away and I think it's time amen that the devil don't want within a mile of your home he don't want in a mile of your church he don't want in a mile of your prayer life I think it's time to go off on this devil drop a truth bomb on him I'm a Son of God go drop a truth bomb on the devil this morning I'm a Son of God I'm bought by the blood Every curse is broken every sin is defeated I'm the Spotless blameless wife of Jesus Christ my name is in the lamb Book of Life I'm anointed to be here I'm anointed to speak the word of God Satan you're in my way and I'm going off until tell every devil is broken preacher what are you saying this morning I want to Simply say you have an inheritance amen I know there's a lot of hindrances I understand that but you know Faith don't have one y'all know that brother BR said there was a little woman remember she came to Jesus and he called her dog go remember I was preaching on Thursday night brother Bram said but what she didn't quit now why didn't she he said because she had hindrances but her faith didn't have any he said your hindrance might be this morning my husband will leave me if I go this way he brother R said my pastor says and we're not we're not talking about here he says my pastor says you can't believe them words like that you can't believe that spoken word you can't believe that brother BR said see there's the hindrance the hindrance brother R said I got about I think he said 10 or 11 things listed here I could show you the hindrances she had he said but her faith didn't have one listen this morning your faith don't have a hindrance that Faith through the power of the blood sin has been broken off of it so brother Wayne what do I do about all these things up to this point all these troubles up to the time of this service I I've been I've been I've been contemplating what to do with my life how to do it I tell you what you do you draw a line in the sand and you step over that line and don't go back you tell that devil I've walked far enough with you I've come up to the borderline I I always say it like this I bet the devil hates me to say this but let the devil find his own ride home yes come on he may have rode all the way to church with you I know he does it I know how the devil is he may have R all the way to church with you you you're driving up the road saying well I'm going to tell this and that and this and that and I think this and that amen and that devil come all the way to church WIll you to be disappointed to have to walk home let him walk home honey can I ride with you though amen you you see it's time it's time Church CU I know what Satan does he'll pile stuff up on you and then when you get ready to believe for the word he brings all of that as a hindrance between you and the promise God's made for you but this is the time this is the morning this is the season to realize the power of that blood and to say to Satan Satan you whip me you you you whipped me up you had me where you wanted me but not no more not another day of thisen we're not doing this anymore amen I have an inheritance it says it right there in the scripture the people will know their God and they'll do exploits if you say under this mountain The Works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than this you do for I go un my father yet a little while you shall
