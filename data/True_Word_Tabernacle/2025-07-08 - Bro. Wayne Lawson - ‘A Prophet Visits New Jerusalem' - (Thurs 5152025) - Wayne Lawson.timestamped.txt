[0:02] The father has a plan.
[0:05] Though it's hard to see it now,
[0:10] you feel you're walking all alone.
[0:15] But he is there, no doubt.
[0:20] When the storm around you rages
[0:24] and you're tossed to and fro.
[0:29] When you're faced with life's decisions,
[0:34] not sure which way to go. Stand still
[0:43] and let God move.
[0:48] Standing still
[0:52] is hard to do.
[0:55] [Applause]
[0:58] When you feel you have reached the end,
[1:03] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[1:11] and let God move.
[1:14] Let's stand tonight.
[1:16] When the enemy
[1:19] surrounds you and the walls are closing
[1:24] in,
[1:26] when the tide is lifted rising,
[1:30] and you wonder where he's been,
[1:35] friend, there never was a moment
[1:39] that his arms weren't reaching out.
[1:44] You can rest assured and be secure. God
[1:49] is moving right now.
[1:53] Stand still. Oh yes, Lord. Let God move.
[2:00] Standing still.
[2:02] Standing still
[2:04] [Music]
[2:06] is hard to do
[2:09] [Music]
[2:11] when you feel
[2:13] [Music]
[2:24] and let God move
[2:28] the Father.
[2:30] Oh, the Father has a plan. Yes, he does.
[2:34] Though it's hard to see it now.
[2:39] You feel you're walking all alone.
[2:44] But he is there. No doubt.
[2:48] When the storm around you ra ages
[2:52] and you're tossed to and fro.
[2:57] When you're faced with life decisions,
[3:02] not sure which way to go. Stand still.
[3:09] [Music]
[3:19] It's hard to do.
[3:25] Can you feel
[3:30] the way
[3:32] you stand?
[3:36] [Applause]
[3:39] [Music]
[3:45] Amen. Certainly good to be in the house
[3:47] of the Lord tonight and to see his
[3:49] mercy. Amen. His grace that he has given
[3:52] us to be here tonight. Amen. God bless
[3:55] each of you that is able to be here.
[3:56] Amen. The house is full on a Thursday
[3:58] night. Amen. What a what a blessing.
[4:01] Amen. We uh certainly appreciated the
[4:04] the Lord for the service on Sunday and
[4:06] the baptisms and what a what an absolute
[4:10] wonderful atmosphere. Amen. And bringing
[4:14] forth in those baptisms and life and
[4:17] Amen. It's such a blessing. Amen. To see
[4:20] God move so powerfully among us and
[4:23] Amen. And we certainly look for that
[4:25] same Jesus to be here tonight. Amen. to
[4:28] take his word to make it alive through
[4:30] our hearts. Amen. And uh I just wonder
[4:34] tonight if we could just bow our hearts
[4:35] in a word of prayer. Amen. Let's just
[4:38] speak to the father. Lord Jesus, we are
[4:41] certainly thankful tonight that we could
[4:43] be in this place, Lord.
[4:45] Father, we are humbled at your presence
[4:48] of your grace that comes upon the
[4:50] meetings, Lord. And Father, we ask you
[4:53] that your grace would be here this
[4:55] evening to lead us. Lord, may you break
[4:58] us away from our own minds and our own
[5:00] feelings and thoughts, Lord. And may you
[5:03] lead us in the paths that lead to
[5:05] righteousness. And Lord, that you would
[5:08] bring life to your people. We pray here
[5:11] tonight that you would speak to their
[5:12] needs. May you heal their bodies, Lord,
[5:15] the special needs that have been read
[5:17] tonight. May you be merciful, Lord, as
[5:19] you move upon them. And we just ask you
[5:22] tonight that you would take the word,
[5:24] Lord, that you would open our hearts and
[5:26] that you would feed us, Father. Now,
[5:28] Lord, we're asking you for your mercy.
[5:31] And Lord, we invite you into this
[5:33] meeting. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[5:36] pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless you
[5:40] tonight. And Amen. If you have your
[5:42] Bibles, we just like to go into the word
[5:44] of the Lord. And um I would like to read
[5:47] in the book of Joel uh the 2 chapter.
[5:51] And we're going to read the 23rd verse
[5:54] down to the 27th verse. Joel chapter 2
[5:58] verse 23
[6:01] through verse 27. We also have some
[6:04] reading in Galatians the 4th chapter the
[6:06] 20th verse.
[6:08] Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and
[6:12] rejoice in the Lord God, for he hath
[6:14] given you the former rain modestly, and
[6:18] he will cause to come down for you the
[6:20] rain, the former rain, and the latter
[6:24] rain in the first month. And the floors
[6:27] shall be full of wheat, and the fat
[6:30] shall overflow with wine and oil. and I
[6:33] will restore to you the years that the
[6:35] locust hath eaten and the cankerworm and
[6:37] the caterpillar and the palmer worm, my
[6:40] great army which I sit among you. Now in
[6:44] in in the second seal, brother Brandham
[6:46] identifies that those four horse riders
[6:49] are just exactly like these bugs here
[6:53] that it's all the same bug.
[6:55] It's just a different stage.
[6:58] Now he says here they shall eat plenty
[7:01] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[7:04] the Lord your God that he hath dealt
[7:06] wondrously with you and my people shall
[7:11] never be ashamed.
[7:13] I I love that. My people shall never be
[7:16] ashamed. Do you all remember the book of
[7:17] Peter when it said that he would lay in
[7:19] Zion a stone and them that believe upon
[7:23] that stone shall not be ashamed?
[7:25] And the prophet said, "What does that
[7:26] mean?" He said it means they have an
[7:28] absolute.
[7:29] That's right.
[7:29] So they don't have to be ashamed. They
[7:31] have thus sayaith the Lord. They have an
[7:33] absolute. And they shall never be
[7:35] ashamed. And he shall know that I am in
[7:37] the midst of Israel and that I am the
[7:40] Lord your God and none else and my
[7:43] people shall never be ashamed. Let's
[7:46] look in Galatians the 4th chapter if we
[7:48] can. I'm going to read the 21st verse.
[7:51] Amen. Uh Galatians chapter 4 21. I'm
[7:54] going to read 10 verses down to verse
[7:56] 31.
[8:00] Tell me,
[8:03] ye that desire to be under the law,
[8:06] do you not hear the law?
[8:09] For it is written that Abraham had two
[8:12] sons,
[8:14] the one by a bond man made, and the
[8:17] other by a free woman.
[8:21] But he who was of the bond woman was
[8:23] born after the flesh, but he of the free
[8:27] woman was born by promise,
[8:29] which things are an allegory. For these
[8:33] are the two covenants, the one from
[8:35] Mount Si, which genderth unto bondage,
[8:38] which is Aar. And for this Aar is Mount
[8:41] Si in Arabia, and answerth to Jerusalem,
[8:45] which now is, and is in bondage with her
[8:49] children.
[8:51] But Jerusalem, which is above, is free,
[8:56] which is the mother of us all. For it is
[9:00] written, "Rejoice thou barren that
[9:02] beareest not. Break forth and cry, thou
[9:05] that travilest not, for the desolate
[9:08] hath many more children than she which
[9:11] hath a husband. Now we, brethren, as
[9:14] Isaac was, are the children of promise.
[9:19] But as then he that was born after the
[9:22] flesh persecuted him. Now you see it,
[9:25] they persecuted him. What's that red
[9:27] horse?
[9:29] It persecuted him that was born after
[9:32] the spirit.
[9:34] So it is now. Nevertheless, what saith
[9:39] the scripture, cast out the bond woman
[9:41] and her son? For the son of the bond
[9:44] woman shall not be heir with the son of
[9:48] the free woman. So then, brethren, we
[9:51] are not children of the bond woman, but
[9:54] of the free. Amen.
[9:56] May God bless his word as you can be
[9:57] seated tonight. I want to continue as if
[9:59] I can on this revelations contained
[10:02] under the seals. Amen. And I I was just
[10:05] speaking to you on Sunday uh dealing
[10:08] with motherhood. And uh I I I pray you
[10:11] uh was uh catching and I felt you were
[10:13] very much catching what I was talking
[10:15] about uh is that I introduced uh two
[10:18] mothers in the front of the sermon and
[10:21] then we discussed two mothers throughout
[10:22] the scripture being the mother of
[10:24] harlots and then the mother of Zion or
[10:27] the free Jerusalem having children.
[10:30] Amen. Brother Brandham actually tells us
[10:32] this. He says that in God perfecting his
[10:34] church, he says it like this. He said,
[10:37] "But see people, they didn't want to
[10:38] have a baby because they was deprived of
[10:41] something." He said, "But God
[10:43] commissioned women to bring forth
[10:45] children."
[10:46] God has commissioned women to bring
[10:49] forth children. Now, we're living in an
[10:50] age, of course, Amen. We we probably
[10:53] don't need to preach so strong here in
[10:54] this church, but uh we're living in an
[10:57] age where that's kind of a a thing
[10:59] nobody wants to do is have children,
[11:01] right? They They want to they want to
[11:03] get away from that. And this is the age
[11:05] actually uh uh uh uh even in what was
[11:08] abortions and birth control stuff like
[11:10] that was introduced and brother Brandham
[11:12] talks about it and he says it was for
[11:13] the sake of night life. You know that's
[11:15] why they do it is the uh the women want
[11:17] to run and do things in the world and
[11:19] they want to they want to act like the
[11:21] world and and they can't do it being
[11:23] weighted down with a baby at home, you
[11:25] know. So they just didn't want to have
[11:27] children. they didn't want to sacrifice
[11:28] their bodies and and so brother Bram is
[11:30] discussing this as the age that we're
[11:33] living in and kind of really identifies
[11:35] it at the time and then shows us see
[11:38] that they was commissioned to do it but
[11:40] they didn't want to do it. So this is a
[11:42] concept that is entirely brought from
[11:44] the women all the way to the church when
[11:47] he starts talking about the church
[11:48] didn't want to bring forth children
[11:50] because it was going to ruin the modern
[11:52] form that they had created. Now in in uh
[11:55] Jehovah Gyiver, brother B would say
[11:57] this. He said see Paul took him deep
[11:59] enough into Christ. He says and he was a
[12:03] living fire on down living in the
[12:05] presence. Now he didn't bring him to
[12:07] some intellectual move or some joiner or
[12:10] get some note signed or some pledge that
[12:12] they would come to church. Take him onto
[12:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he'll
[12:17] be on fire and bring forth children. Now
[12:20] he's discussing, you know, he's
[12:21] discussing Billy Graham coming and
[12:23] telling people that he had 30,000
[12:25] converts come back in a year and
[12:27] couldn't find one. And he blamed it on
[12:29] the preachers. And brother Graham said,
[12:30] "But I'd like to tell Mr. Graham that
[12:32] Paul went into a city, had one convert,
[12:35] and come back and had many converts." He
[12:37] said, "Because Paul took them somewhere
[12:39] where brother Graham wasn't taking them
[12:42] is he took them on unto the baptism of
[12:44] the Holy Ghost." post. Brother man said,
[12:46] "If you'll do that, then he'll be on
[12:48] fire and he'll bring forth children."
[12:50] Now, how can you do it when he's
[12:52] sterile? Hey, He can't have children
[12:54] unless he's got life himself. Amen.
[12:57] That's powerful, isn't it? He can't do
[12:59] it unless he's got life himself. And
[13:01] that's the only way anything can pro uh
[13:04] pro procreate itself is by the germ. And
[13:08] the germ is the Holy Spirit that was in
[13:12] Christ that's in the believer. Amen. So
[13:14] you can't bring forth life if you don't
[13:16] have life. Amen. It's got to come forth
[13:19] from the church. Now in the Pergamus
[13:21] age, brother Bam is telling us this is
[13:23] the sin that was happening in that age
[13:26] under the teaching of Balum is that the
[13:28] people were were committing
[13:30] fornications. And brother Bam says it.
[13:32] He says what was going on there is it
[13:34] was killing the people. Now we recognize
[13:36] in this age it's not so much physical
[13:38] death as it is spiritual death. And
[13:41] brother Bam says, "Now, as soon as you
[13:43] walk out and join a church, instead of
[13:46] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[13:48] you're dead."
[13:50] Now, I'm I'm going to let that soak in.
[13:52] He says, "Dead." You have a name. You
[13:54] have like Luther or the Sardis seat, but
[13:57] Sardis means dead. See, you have a name
[13:59] that you're alive, but you're dead.
[14:02] That's what God said. And when they had
[14:04] committed fornication, spiritual
[14:06] fornications, and they got the church
[14:08] married up from the baptism of the Holy
[14:10] Ghost to denomination, they become dead.
[14:13] There you are. That's what the Bible
[14:15] says. He's speaking of churches. When
[14:17] they took away from from preaching the
[14:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost to preaching
[14:22] my denomination or my organization, then
[14:25] they spiritually killed the people
[14:27] because denomination can't bring life.
[14:30] It cannot bring the life because it has
[14:33] no life to bring. Amen. When did
[14:35] denomination ever raise the dead? When
[14:37] has denomination ever healed the sick?
[14:40] When has denomination ever done
[14:42] anything? Brother Bam said its only type
[14:44] in the Bible is Babylon. Amen. Now, in
[14:47] seed not the shuck, he said neither can
[14:49] the church under its secretariism. He
[14:52] said it takes a virgin belief in the
[14:54] word of God to make a promise and to
[14:57] bring forth children. Now,
[14:58] secretarianism would never bring forth a
[15:01] reborn church. It cannot do it. See,
[15:04] it'll bring forth a substitutionary
[15:06] something, but it can't bring something.
[15:09] See, he says, see, it's something. It
[15:11] tries to be like it, but it can't bring
[15:13] it. He said, but that genuine bornagain
[15:16] church of God believes the word in the
[15:19] face of anything regardless of what it
[15:21] is because it's unadulterated.
[15:23] It's by the promise of God. See, it's
[15:25] been brought. See when when we look at
[15:27] this and see if a church see if it comes
[15:30] to the place that it refuses to be
[15:32] pregnantated with the word of God he
[15:34] said then how can it bring forth
[15:36] children of this age if it would deny to
[15:39] bring forth and you you we can say well
[15:42] we received the teaching but brother Bam
[15:44] is very clear amen that you can take a
[15:46] you can take a hen and let it lay eggs
[15:48] all day but unless the rooster goes into
[15:50] the hens amen there won't never be life
[15:53] it'll be a nest full of rotten eggs and
[15:55] And and we can teach the message and we
[15:58] can talk about the instruments and the
[15:59] word and but the Bible's already clear.
[16:02] The spirit giveth life. Amen. But the
[16:05] letter kleth. Amen. It causes death
[16:08] because we can organize and we can and
[16:10] we can dot all the tees and we can get
[16:12] it all. This is what we believe and this
[16:14] is how we're going to do it. See, but
[16:16] God chose to bring life by the baptism
[16:19] of the Holy Ghost quickening the word
[16:22] that was preached in its age. I I
[16:24] believe he says it like this. It brings
[16:26] forth, "And we are not Lutheran, and we
[16:28] are not Wesleyanss, and neither are we
[16:30] Pentecostals. Then we are children of
[16:33] this age through the pregnancy of the
[16:35] word of God to bring forth a child of
[16:38] this age, the sea child." Oh my, I like
[16:41] that. Don't you? They become children of
[16:43] the word. Not children of the church,
[16:46] not children of the world, but children
[16:49] of the word of God. Amen. That's exactly
[16:51] what we want to be. We want to be
[16:53] begotten by the word of God. That's what
[16:55] Peter said, the incorruptible word of
[16:58] God that we are brought forth from. Now,
[17:00] now, if if if God ever does anything in
[17:03] the church, it'll have to go back to
[17:05] that original word before it can ever do
[17:08] it. And and let me just say plainly what
[17:10] brother Bam says. If it don't bring
[17:12] forth children, bridechild, word
[17:14] children, then it's a denominational
[17:16] child. her first love. See the world in
[17:19] the denomination, she's gone back to
[17:21] that and it can't bring a real genuine
[17:25] born-again Christian because there's
[17:27] nothing to bring forth. Amen. Look at
[17:30] this. A prophet is teaching us. So why
[17:32] why are we not a denomination? Why do we
[17:34] not believe in organizations? Because
[17:36] they are sterile and have no power to
[17:38] bring forth life. Amen. that you you see
[17:41] the Bible tells us that we must we must
[17:45] it's not a suggestion but we must be
[17:47] born again and before that we can
[17:49] procreate there has to be a life on the
[17:52] inside of the church and I I know that
[17:54] life is the rejected part that's the
[17:57] embarrassing ashamed part of the world
[17:59] that we're living in but we are not
[18:01] ashamed and and we are not embarrassed
[18:03] by the power of the Holy Ghost that
[18:05] makes life now we can't depend on our
[18:08] intellectuals and you'll never get born
[18:11] of the spirit by intellectuals.
[18:14] Brother Brham said, "When did God ever
[18:16] choose the intellectuals to bring forth
[18:18] life?" He never did it. When did God
[18:21] ever choose the higherups and the high
[18:23] society and the education? He never did.
[18:26] God never did. Amen. But he took the
[18:29] fisherman and the uneducated and the
[18:31] unlearned. Amen. And brought forth his
[18:34] kingdom. Amen. Out of that which was,
[18:36] Amen. weak. He brought perfection.
[18:38] That's right. spoken word, original
[18:40] seed. Brother Bam says, "Amen." Amen.
[18:42] The world today, he said, "The church."
[18:44] She says, "Listen, she's married to
[18:46] another man." Now, she hasn't got Jesus.
[18:49] She's got the pope.
[18:52] No, we haven't. The Protestant hasn't
[18:54] got Jesus. It's got a denomination.
[18:57] Right?
[18:57] So, it can't give a word birth to her
[18:59] children.
[19:00] Right?
[19:01] Because she's a hearted herself.
[19:03] Now, look at what the prophet is
[19:05] teaching us. He's saying very clearly
[19:07] that to have life, Amen, there has got
[19:10] to be a lifegiver.
[19:13] There's got to be a lifegiver. There's
[19:15] got to be something that brings forth.
[19:17] Amen. I I'll say this when you're
[19:18] watching the invisible union. Brother
[19:20] Bam is trying to teach there the
[19:22] invisible union of the bride and groom.
[19:24] And he starts talking about children and
[19:27] he says, "Now they're bringing forth
[19:28] members all the time." He says, "See,
[19:31] but what is it? It you've got to see
[19:33] what kind of papa they have." He said,
[19:35] "The first Adam or the second Adam." He
[19:38] said, "Now, if the church brings forth a
[19:40] child of the second Adam, it's going to
[19:43] act like the second Adam's children
[19:45] acted." And you say, "How did they act?"
[19:48] They acted on the day of Pentecost.
[19:50] That's exactly how God's true children
[19:53] act when they're born. And they like
[19:55] they were on the day of Pentecost. Now,
[19:57] I know the world has changed out the
[20:00] baptism of the spirit for denominational
[20:02] joining. You know, Amen. just come and
[20:04] join the church or come and put yourself
[20:06] and become a member of the church. But
[20:08] listen, you can't join this church.
[20:11] You've got to be born into the church.
[20:13] Amen. There was never a day I become a
[20:15] lawson. There I I just got one day said,
[20:18] "Well, I want to be a Lawson." I was
[20:19] born to Lawson. Brother said he was born
[20:21] to Brandham. Amen. And the church of the
[20:23] living God, you can't just one day say,
[20:25] "Hey, I want to join the church and I'm
[20:27] going to become a Christian." Amen. You
[20:29] got to be born a Christian. You got to
[20:31] be born by the baptism of the Holy
[20:34] Ghost. There's got to be a new birth on
[20:36] the inside. You say, "Preacher, uh, why
[20:39] are you there?" Because we still have
[20:40] some that needs the birth of the spirit
[20:43] of God. Amen. It's one thing to say, "I
[20:45] believe the message." Amen. And the
[20:47] devil does, too.
[20:49] And he fears and trembles at the idea
[20:52] that God sent a prophet. I believe Jesus
[20:54] is the son of God. The devil believes
[20:56] it, too. But he ain't saved. But a
[20:59] saving is not a church joining. It's an
[21:01] old-fashioned dying out and a repentance
[21:04] and a baptism of the Holy Spirit that
[21:06] burns sin out and mortifies the deeds of
[21:09] this body. We got too many Christians
[21:12] that's alive. Amen. They're alive to the
[21:14] world, but we need to die to the world
[21:16] and we can live in Christ. Let the
[21:19] resurrection power of the Holy Spirit
[21:21] get a hold of us and resurrect that
[21:24] life. I believe in it. I believe in no
[21:26] sky blue, sinkilling, holy ghost
[21:28] religion, sacrifice preaching. Amen.
[21:31] Take the polish off of the thing and
[21:34] preach the power of God until souls are
[21:36] saved, lives are delivered, hearts are
[21:39] changed, healing takes place. Amen.
[21:42] Miracles and manifestations of God
[21:44] moving the church of the living God. We
[21:46] are not a dead church. We are a living
[21:50] manifestation of the Elohim God and has
[21:53] come down in our age. The Holy Ghost is
[21:56] not in heaven, folks. It's in the church
[21:58] of the living God. And God is looking
[22:01] for a place. The Bible says in the last
[22:03] days that they have a form of godliness
[22:06] that they deny the power thereof, the
[22:09] power to give birth, the power to bring
[22:12] deliverance, the power of the fire of
[22:14] God to devour the unbelief out of the
[22:17] church of the living God. I I believe
[22:19] that there's a reality to this message.
[22:22] There's a reality to the things of God.
[22:25] Amen. I I I certainly believe that God
[22:28] has given this age. Amen. and and and we
[22:31] could look at this and talk about the
[22:33] harlot and we could look at her
[22:34] daughters, but the Bible said judgment
[22:36] is coming upon her.
[22:38] And brother Brandon says it very
[22:40] clearly. He said that judgment, Amen.
[22:42] the judgment in Revelation 17 is the
[22:45] judgment that he shows it. And in and if
[22:47] you uh if you look in Revelation 17,
[22:50] there's a angel here revealing, Amen.
[22:53] the judgment of this and its
[22:55] denomination. Brother Bam said,
[22:56] "Everything in it is cursed."
[22:58] Yeah.
[23:00] See, everything in it is cursed.
[23:03] Now, if you read uh let me just read
[23:06] from Revelations 14. And I I want you to
[23:08] watch uh Revelations 14 and you can look
[23:11] in that ninth verse is that third angel.
[23:13] But if you back it up to that first
[23:15] angel, you can look and and and and hear
[23:18] their sermons. Now there's many of
[23:20] writers here that knows uh very well
[23:25] that there are three angels here and
[23:26] many of them tie them to three great
[23:29] ministries in the end time.
[23:35] Let's see and let's look at the second
[23:37] verse. And I heard the voice of heaven a
[23:40] voice of many waters and the voice of a
[23:42] great thunder and heard the voice of the
[23:44] thunders harpening. And they sung a song
[23:46] and the four beasts and the elders and
[23:48] no man could learn. And the four 40 and
[23:51] 4,000 which were redeemed from the
[23:54] earth. Now these are which were not
[23:55] defiled with a woman. For they had are
[23:58] virgins and these are which follow the
[24:00] lamb wheroever he goeth. And these are
[24:02] redeemed from among men. And in their
[24:05] mouth was found no g
[24:08] for they without fault before the throne
[24:09] of God. And I saw another angel flying
[24:12] in the midst of heaven, having an
[24:14] everlasting gospel. And he preached unto
[24:16] them that dwell upon the earth, unto
[24:18] every nation, kindred, tongue, and
[24:20] people, saying with a loud voice, "Fear
[24:22] God, and give glory to him, for the hour
[24:24] of judgment is come, and worship him
[24:27] that made heaven and earth and the sea
[24:29] and the fountains thereof." Amen. And
[24:31] now watch, Brother Ram said, "Now
[24:32] there's your Martin Luther." So we're
[24:34] counting three angels. We'll just count
[24:35] them. There's your Martin Luther. Now
[24:37] that's a ministry that was coming into
[24:39] the earth. Now watch in this next verse
[24:42] and it says and there followed another
[24:45] angel saying Babylon is falling is
[24:48] falling the great because she has made
[24:50] the nations drank of the wine of the
[24:51] wrath of her fornications. Now there
[24:53] brother Brham says is that sanctifying
[24:55] message of John Wesley. But then watch
[24:58] this third one. He said, "And a third
[25:00] angel followed them, saying with a loud
[25:02] voice, if any man worship the beast and
[25:06] his image, and received the mark in his
[25:08] forehead or in his hand, the same shall
[25:11] drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
[25:14] which is poured out without mixture into
[25:17] the cup of indignation. He shall be
[25:18] tormented with fire and brimstone, and
[25:20] the presence of the holy angels in in
[25:22] the presence of the lamb." So, somebody
[25:24] says, "Well, brother Wayne, can I can I
[25:26] stay in denomination and worship God?"
[25:28] Look at this third angel's message.
[25:31] He says that you either have to worship
[25:33] God or be marked with a beast.
[25:36] Now, he he's very clear in that that you
[25:39] can't worship God and mammon at the same
[25:42] time.
[25:43] You you're not able to stay within that.
[25:45] Now, now if you watch that same third
[25:47] angel, now go to Revelations 18 and
[25:50] you'll watch how that in the let's just
[25:52] start with that first verse. Revelations
[25:54] 18. same same that third angel is flying
[25:57] at the same time that this message is
[26:00] coming. And these things which I saw
[26:02] another angel come down from heaven
[26:04] having great power and the earth was
[26:05] lighted with glory and cried mightily
[26:08] with a strong voice saying Babylon the
[26:11] great is fallen is fallen has become the
[26:12] habitation of devils and the hold of
[26:14] every foul spirit and the cage of every
[26:17] unclean and hateful bird. For all the
[26:20] nations had drunk of the wine of the
[26:21] wrath of her fornications, and the king
[26:23] of the earth had committed fornications
[26:25] with her, and the merchants in the earth
[26:27] were waxed which with her abundance and
[26:29] her delic delicacies. And I heard
[26:32] another voice from heaven, saying, "Come
[26:35] out of her, my people,
[26:38] that you be not partakers of her sin,
[26:40] that you receive not of her plagues, for
[26:43] her sins have reached unto heaven, and
[26:45] God hath remembered her iniquities." Now
[26:47] listen, that same voice of Revelations
[26:49] 14:9, that third angel, you can't do
[26:52] both. So what's the answer to it? Come
[26:55] out of it, my people. Now the Bible
[26:58] says, I heard a voice out of heaven. How
[27:00] many realizes, brother Bam talks about
[27:02] this area and he says this voice coming
[27:04] out of heaven, but really he said the
[27:06] voice is on earth and as it's speaking
[27:09] on earth, it so is recognized in heaven
[27:13] that it echoes back out of heaven. So
[27:16] heaven is saying the same thing as this
[27:19] angel is saying, "Come out of her my
[27:22] people and be not partakers of your
[27:24] fornications." Now, amen. You see then
[27:27] you you see God calling out that church
[27:30] out of denominations, out of systems.
[27:33] Now, now when you when you start looking
[27:35] into this, you say, "Well, well, Brother
[27:37] Wayne, we've come out a long time ago."
[27:38] And absolutely we have. Amen. But we
[27:41] have another generation that's on the
[27:43] scene today. Amen. that is that's facing
[27:46] the same things that our fathers faced
[27:49] when they come out of denominations. And
[27:52] there's a big push for people to say,
[27:54] "Well, what's the difference anyhow? And
[27:56] what's all the troubles about?" And
[27:57] Amen. And and why why do we have to
[28:00] worry about it? Why don't you just
[28:01] mingle and we could be ecumenical and we
[28:03] could go out and be a part of these
[28:05] things and and you know, after all, if
[28:06] we was a little more friendly, we could
[28:08] win those UPC's and we could win the
[28:10] Baptist and we could do all these
[28:12] things. That's exactly the teachings of
[28:14] Balum. And brother Mam said it very
[28:17] clearly. He said, "Don't go out there on
[28:19] their ground."
[28:21] Come on. He said, "You're presuming when
[28:23] you do it. Don't go out there on their
[28:25] ground. Come out of her, my people, and
[28:29] be not partakers of her fornications."
[28:32] Amen. Now you Now, now when we look at
[28:34] this, we say, "Well, I know it sounds a
[28:36] little a little rough, but let me just
[28:38] say this. There is no life in
[28:41] denomination.
[28:43] Denominational ages have run out. They
[28:46] they have run out of light. They have
[28:48] run out of life. Amen. And God is
[28:51] actually revealing this age. He reveals
[28:54] the book to prove to us he's not in that
[28:58] system any longer.
[29:00] Have you ever seen it in the Bible when
[29:01] they crucified Jesus and they put him on
[29:04] the cross and he's dying? The Bible said
[29:06] and the earth began to quake. Amen. And
[29:08] the veil was rent from the top to the
[29:10] bottom. Now, brother Ma'am said there
[29:12] wasn't no man could reach up there. So,
[29:14] we seen that it was the hand of God that
[29:17] rent the temple veil. And when they rent
[29:20] the veil, they could see inside where
[29:22] the veil was. Amen. And we could see
[29:24] that the glory had left what they had
[29:28] said was behind the veil. It was the
[29:30] opening of the word that showed the
[29:33] glory that the Pentecostals claimed to
[29:36] have had left. when they had organized.
[29:39] But without the word declaring it, we
[29:41] would have went on believing the pillar
[29:43] of fire was back there behind that. But
[29:46] mercy had moved on. And when the veil
[29:49] was opened up, it revealed to us not
[29:52] just where mercy had had been, but where
[29:54] it was today.
[29:57] Do you see the ages have run out? Amen.
[30:00] In other words, the denominational ages,
[30:02] brother Bam says it very clearly. He
[30:04] said the denominational ages have been
[30:05] carriers. They have been part of this
[30:08] word for it has been hid from the
[30:11] reformers and sealed away until the age
[30:14] this eagle appears. See it's been hid
[30:17] from the wise and the prudent. Just like
[30:19] in seed not air but the shuck there are
[30:21] three seeds. There are three women not
[30:23] three seeds three women. And brother
[30:25] Brham said each one of these womens are
[30:27] only carriers of the seed until it
[30:30] matures in Jesus Christ.
[30:32] See that's why you couldn't stop it with
[30:34] the Lutheran message. You couldn't.
[30:37] That's the Protestant, right? And you
[30:39] can't stop with a Wesleyian message. And
[30:41] you you can't stop with the reformation
[30:43] of gifts, even with the baptism of the
[30:44] spirit. Amen. Because each one of them
[30:47] was a stage of the word. Brother man
[30:50] makes it clear. He says, watch, Hagar
[30:53] was not her. He said it was not the
[30:56] seed. She was a carrier. Mary and and
[30:59] Sarah were all carriers. Many people
[31:01] would like to type us as as as Mary. You
[31:04] you listen. Pentecost was Mary. That's
[31:07] right.
[31:08] Amen. But the full word has to come into
[31:11] manifestation.
[31:12] Do you see? Then you can't stop back
[31:14] there. You can't do it because this is
[31:17] seed time. Life has left the husk and
[31:21] came into the seed.
[31:23] The life is in the seed in the age we're
[31:26] living in. See, it's bride time. The
[31:28] shucks are dead. The shucks are dried
[31:30] up. It's virgin word time.
[31:32] Amen. Now you see this old system is
[31:35] done and she's a dry shuck.
[31:40] That's that's pretty powerful, isn't it?
[31:42] And she's a dry shuck.
[31:44] Now now when you're uh studying this
[31:47] second seal,
[31:49] brother Bam will talk about this and
[31:51] he'll say he'll say here it's Satan's
[31:53] duty to pervert the word of God to
[31:57] wisdom's reasoning.
[32:00] Now then he marks his subjects
[32:03] by rejecting the original word.
[32:07] Now it's Satan's duty to take the
[32:10] scripture and twist it.
[32:13] And he marks those that are his subjects
[32:17] by a rejection of the original word.
[32:21] You you you see so somebody said, "Well,
[32:23] who is God's children and who is the
[32:25] devil's children?" He marks his
[32:27] subjects.
[32:28] You don't have to guess who's listening
[32:30] to the devil.
[32:33] Right? You get to listening to the
[32:35] devil. The first thing that comes is a
[32:37] rejection of the original word.
[32:40] When somebody starts reasoning out and
[32:43] thinking about the message and they
[32:44] start and they really get troubled over
[32:46] something, the the mark of that is the
[32:50] rejection of the word.
[32:52] Do you see? Now, I'm just going to read.
[32:54] Brother Bam says it's Satan's duty to
[32:56] mark his subjects by this. And he said,
[32:59] "If you'll suffer here, I want to show
[33:00] you this. Let me show you a type." He
[33:03] said, "Listen, they marked in the Old
[33:05] Testament. They would mark it the 40th
[33:07] nth year." He said they would go into
[33:09] Jubilee and slaves heard this. And you
[33:11] know the story of the Jubilee. He said,
[33:13] "And there's nothing that could keep
[33:15] them from going free if he would just
[33:17] throw down his hoe so long he could go
[33:20] back home as soon as the trumpet
[33:22] sounded." Now I I want you to hear the
[33:24] power of what he's saying. He said every
[33:26] every 50 years. Now now in in Israel
[33:29] they maybe would get uh uh they would
[33:31] get sired bound or they would get maybe
[33:34] in uh could we say it like this
[33:36] something would take claim of them like
[33:38] a church or in modern terms like a
[33:40] denomination or some belief system and
[33:43] and and they would sell out to that and
[33:45] they would remain there until the
[33:48] blowing of the trumpet. Now every 50
[33:50] years the trumpet would blow. And
[33:52] brother Ben's saying something powerful
[33:53] when he says this. When the trumpet
[33:56] blew, nothing
[33:58] could keep them from returning back.
[34:01] See, when the trumpet blew, there was a
[34:04] power in it that could release them as
[34:07] long as they're willing to go.
[34:10] And brother Manam is teaching us that
[34:12] the blowing of that trumpet is the
[34:14] gospel trumpet. According to Paul, if
[34:16] the trumpet makes a certain sound, Amen.
[34:19] This this sound of the trumpet is that
[34:22] you could be free from the
[34:24] denominational thinking. See, you could
[34:26] be free of water baptism and trinitarian
[34:28] ideas. You could be free of the
[34:31] Armenianism idea of of that I could save
[34:33] and be lost and save. Amen. All these
[34:36] ideas that had bound down God's children
[34:40] the moment that the trumpet sounded,
[34:42] they are free to go. And there's nothing
[34:45] that can hold them if they're willing to
[34:47] go.
[34:48] See, if you're willing to believe,
[34:50] there's nothing can hold you in unbelief
[34:53] when you're ready to believe God's word.
[34:56] But Satan will mark his subjects by a
[34:59] denial of the original word. Brother Bam
[35:01] then makes it very clear. He said, "See,
[35:03] he marks them in their ear. He pokes
[35:06] something in their ear." And brother Bam
[35:08] said, "Don't you let the devil poke that
[35:10] in your ear.
[35:11] Don't you let unbelief get poked in your
[35:13] ear like, well, we don't believe in that
[35:15] Holy Ghost stuff no more. We we don't
[35:17] believe in the moving of the spirit. We
[35:19] don't we don't believe in the power of
[35:21] God released in the church and
[35:22] manifestations of his spirit and life
[35:25] and and you know they they'll take it a
[35:26] step further. We don't believe in that
[35:28] opening the word and we don't believe in
[35:30] that that paracia you know the presence
[35:32] of God. We don't let the devil poke that
[35:34] in your ear
[35:36] because see that's his job is to rob
[35:39] from you the virtues and the glorious
[35:42] power of this word. But he does it by
[35:45] reasoning the scriptures, twisting them
[35:48] to make you his prisoner.
[35:52] My goodness. Amen. See what he does? He
[35:54] marks them. He marks them. And brother
[35:56] Bam said God marks his by vindicating
[35:59] his word through them.
[36:02] See, vindicating his word through them.
[36:04] In other words, the original word flows
[36:07] through you. That's the mark, the
[36:10] identification of a child of God. The
[36:13] original word moves through you with
[36:15] life. See, Jesus said it, "The works
[36:17] that I do shall ye do." Also, the spirit
[36:21] makes the word live through you with
[36:23] life. I I just love how brother Bam uh
[36:26] uh breaks these things open to us. And
[36:28] and and I just wonder if it's okay with
[36:31] you. I I have so much here, so I'm just
[36:33] going to have to maybe preach it instead
[36:34] of read it if it's okay. Amen. But but
[36:37] you watch how that whenever God sounds
[36:40] something he vindicates it. He brings
[36:43] life.
[36:44] Now it brings light. Now if you start
[36:48] discussing uh when Jesus looked at his
[36:50] his followers he said you are the light
[36:53] of the world.
[36:55] Now Paul speaks of you he calls you the
[36:58] saints of light
[37:01] the children of light. Yeah,
[37:03] remember that he says that you have your
[37:05] inheritance in light.
[37:08] Now, this this this word light that
[37:10] we're speaking of is I think it's
[37:11] phosphorus or fos in the Greek. But but
[37:14] you you got to know that 2,000 years
[37:17] ago, they didn't have electric.
[37:19] So, light was discussing fire. It was
[37:22] like the the lamp that burned was the
[37:24] light. The light was a fire that burned.
[37:27] And and and so what what you what you
[37:30] see is that the the light would come in
[37:31] the age. Brother described this and he
[37:33] said light is not he defines it brother
[37:35] Kyle and he says light's not like this
[37:37] electric light here. He said light is
[37:40] when the word is vindicated.
[37:44] So when the when the word is brought to
[37:46] pass that becomes the light of that age.
[37:51] See watch where do you get light from?
[37:54] The most original light source is the
[37:57] word of God. See in the beginning God
[38:00] said let there be light. So light comes
[38:04] from the word of God.
[38:06] Then there is a light as John said if
[38:08] you walk in the light as he is in the
[38:10] light then you have fellowship. So there
[38:12] is a light for an age.
[38:15] So when you watch there was a Luther's
[38:17] day there was a light for that day.
[38:20] There was a light and that light was the
[38:22] scriptures. The just shall live by
[38:24] faith. And if you look at it in John
[38:26] Wesley, sanctify them through thy word.
[38:29] Thy word is truth. He preached the power
[38:31] of sanctification. And that was the
[38:33] light of the day. See, the word was the
[38:36] source of the light of his age. But
[38:38] look, amen. You You can't look back in
[38:42] that time and try to preach that same
[38:45] message today
[38:47] because what was light yesterday is
[38:50] darkness today.
[38:51] Let just take the just take the earth
[38:53] itself. Amen. And and and it was it it
[38:56] it it was light. Let's just go back over
[38:58] into the far east coast in the middle of
[39:00] the Atlantic Ocean. Amen. It was real
[39:02] bright back there a few hours ago, but
[39:04] it ain't right now.
[39:06] See, because light is constantly moving.
[39:10] It It's moving. It's alive. It's not
[39:12] dead. You can't nail it down and say,
[39:14] "Well, it'll be this way tomorrow."
[39:16] That's why Brother Ben said, "You can't
[39:17] keep the Sabbath."
[39:19] Yeah.
[39:19] Right. He said, "These Sabbathke
[39:21] keepers, you can't keep it." He said,
[39:22] "It passes away.
[39:24] The Sabbath is never the same. It moves.
[39:27] It's constantly moving." And you see,
[39:29] then when people try to take the light
[39:31] of one age and make it the light of the
[39:33] next age, then what they do is they
[39:35] actually actually put out the day and
[39:39] the light of the day you're living.
[39:41] Yeah.
[39:41] Now, uh, when I'm when I'm reading this,
[39:44] I I I would like to go to the book of
[39:46] Shalom if I can. Um, Brother Bam will
[39:49] brother do something very beautiful in
[39:51] the in the shalom book and and uh let me
[39:54] see if I can get the correct place here.
[39:58] Um,
[40:01] brother Madam is is discussing something
[40:03] in the there's two uh messages shalom
[40:06] and I'm looking at the one in
[40:09] uh Jeffersonville
[40:11] and on page 16, brother Boss talk about
[40:13] this and he begins to go into the age
[40:16] that we're living and he talks about the
[40:19] darkness talks about the way that the
[40:22] children are acting the way the churches
[40:24] are acting. the way the people are
[40:25] acting
[40:26] and he starts talking about it and he
[40:27] says it's just darkness everywhere,
[40:30] right? And he and he goes into it and he
[40:32] talks about it. He says but but he says
[40:35] but when you see it on the people he
[40:39] said surely this is coming from
[40:40] somewhere.
[40:41] Yeah.
[40:42] Now if you if you go into the scriptures
[40:44] then you can discover where it actually
[40:47] comes from. And brother Bam then says to
[40:49] us, he said, "Every great event in first
[40:53] that's going to happen on the earth is
[40:55] shown in the heavens."
[40:58] Now, um, Brother Brand described this uh
[41:01] when he preaches the church ages. How
[41:04] many ever How many ever knew that
[41:06] brother Bam uh when he preached the
[41:08] church ages, he drew the moons?
[41:10] Yeah.
[41:10] That represent the church. Can we just
[41:12] bring up the picture there? Let's bring
[41:13] up the seven church ages picture. Just a
[41:15] plain picture. And brother Bam drew the
[41:17] moons. Now, he did this in 1960s. And
[41:19] look at the what what you're looking at
[41:21] is the moon itself and how the sun is
[41:24] shining on the moon.
[41:26] And so he's showing you the phases of
[41:28] the church and how it went so dark and
[41:31] then it looks like it comes light and
[41:32] then it comes back dark again. And he
[41:34] he's showing you the phases of the sun
[41:37] on that moon in the church ages. And
[41:39] brother Bam says, "Now watch." He says,
[41:41] "But God always does things in threes."
[41:45] And he says he brought it to me in
[41:46] inspiration.
[41:48] He said I actually drew it on a
[41:50] blackboard. And what you're looking at
[41:51] the picture, Brother Bam, drew it on a
[41:53] blackboard up on the platform. He said,
[41:56] but then the Holy Spirit came in. He
[41:59] said, and drew it on the back wall
[42:02] in a light shading back and forth. Now,
[42:05] I have talked to people that was sitting
[42:07] in the service when it happened.
[42:10] And they said, you know, until people
[42:12] started like passing out and stuff, you
[42:13] really didn't even know anything was
[42:15] happening. But people were seeing it
[42:17] happen on the wall and they got really
[42:18] excited. Brother Jim Ed Dalton and him,
[42:20] they there's a lot of personal
[42:22] eyewitnesses that was in that meeting
[42:24] and and they said, "Brother, of course,
[42:25] brother Bam then talks about it and he
[42:27] says he says people was talking about
[42:29] something back there." He said actually
[42:31] he was up here on the platform and he
[42:33] was reflecting it on the wall. A and he
[42:36] says watch now. First by inspiration he
[42:39] said secondly it happened. He said and
[42:42] God drew it on the wall. He said but
[42:44] then before every great event he puts it
[42:46] in the heavens. You got that next one?
[42:48] Amen. And in December of 1963, brother
[42:51] Brandham actually brings out this
[42:53] picture. Amen. in in Shalom's sermon in
[42:56] January, he brings out this picture
[42:58] which is you notice six pictures of the
[43:01] moon and brother says these six pictures
[43:03] watch how that last one the light is
[43:05] barely living there. He said because
[43:07] we're now in the seventh and he said
[43:09] these six pictures and these were events
[43:11] that was happening in the heavens he
[43:14] said before it happened on the earth.
[43:16] Now, this is coming out December, I
[43:17] think 28th in the in the Tucson paper. A
[43:21] and and a man, a woman gives it to
[43:23] brother Bham. And brother Bam said,
[43:24] "There it is. There's the third witness
[43:26] of it." Now, now it's amazing because
[43:30] Amen. Right there in that same January,
[43:33] the Pope of Rome, which is Pope Leo or
[43:37] Pope Paul the 6th, left Jerusalem or
[43:41] Rome for the first time in history.
[43:44] There's never been a pope leave Rome
[43:47] until Pope V 6, the Paul V 6, I'm going
[43:50] to call him Pope 6, Pope Paul V 6th, he
[43:52] left Rome and went to Jerusalem for the
[43:55] first time in the history of the church.
[43:57] And brother Bam said, "Watch it." Now,
[44:00] the Pope going to Jerusalem, God
[44:03] witnessed that event three different
[44:05] times.
[44:07] He said by inspiration by drawing it on
[44:09] the blackboard and then by in the
[44:11] heavens he said it pre it it it it
[44:15] predated it was the event of a pope
[44:18] going to Jerusalem. Now now it's amazing
[44:20] cuz somebody said what what's such a big
[44:23] deal about the pope going to Jerusalem.
[44:25] Well I've read to you in the book of
[44:26] Galatians the fourth chapter here and I
[44:28] read to you about two different
[44:30] Jerusalems. We read about a Jerusalem.
[44:34] Amen. That is a natural city of
[44:35] Jerusalem. And then we read about a
[44:37] Jerusalem that is from above.
[44:40] And when the Pope Paul V 6th went to
[44:43] Jerusalem, he went to the natural
[44:46] Jerusalem and brother Bam says, "Watch
[44:48] it." He put out their lights. Now, now
[44:51] the first time that a Roman Catholic
[44:53] church goes to Jerusalem, a pope goes,
[44:57] Brother Bam said, "What does it
[44:58] represent that Jerusalem is the oldest
[45:01] church in the world?" He said, 'What is
[45:03] it doing? He said, it's the natural
[45:06] church. It's church carnal. It's the
[45:09] system church. And the pope is coming
[45:12] for fellowship. And what's he doing when
[45:14] he comes? He's putting out the lights of
[45:17] the church. What's he doing? He's
[45:19] darkening them from real true belief.
[45:22] What did the pope go there for? To
[45:24] fellowship with them. Listen, the Roman
[45:26] Catholic Church didn't give up one thing
[45:29] when they started fellowshipping with
[45:30] the Protestants. There wasn't one there
[45:33] wasn't one thing the Roman church said,
[45:35] "Sorry, we were wrong on this or we we
[45:37] were going to back up on this." Amen.
[45:39] But it was the denominations, the
[45:41] Protestants that started calming down
[45:43] their rhetoric. Amen. And begin to
[45:46] invite the pope into their systems. Come
[45:49] on. in January of 1964. And it was so
[45:53] important. Brother Ram said, "God made
[45:55] it shine in the heavens to tell the
[45:57] church that darkness is covering the
[45:59] earth because the Roman Catholic Church
[46:02] is coming to the Protestant church. He's
[46:04] coming for fellowship." Now, somebody
[46:06] said, "Well, Wayne, that's not really a"
[46:08] But you watch it. You watch how that the
[46:10] Roman church begin to bring its creeds
[46:12] and fellowship with them there in 1964.
[46:15] Now, I don't know if any of you other uh
[46:17] uh folks have thought about this, but I
[46:19] think it's amazing that at the same
[46:21] time, amen, that God is visiting his
[46:23] church, the church spiritual, the new
[46:26] Jerusalem,
[46:28] Brother said that new Jerusalem. Now, I
[46:31] don't want to get so fast you don't
[46:32] catch my point here. That new Jerusalem,
[46:35] he said, watch, when Abraham was coming
[46:37] home, he said he met me,
[46:41] who was the king of Jerusalem.
[46:44] He said not Jerusalem natural but
[46:48] spiritual Jerusalem. Melchazdc meeting
[46:51] Abraham. Amen. What was he doing? He was
[46:54] on his road home and he come to meet
[46:56] him. Amen. To bring light to him. To
[46:59] bring a visitation to him. At the same
[47:02] time the pope is coming to denominations
[47:06] to put their lights out.
[47:09] Bring up the other picture. Amen. The
[47:12] same time there in Tucson just around
[47:15] between Tucson and Prescuit. Amen. That
[47:17] ringshaped cloud appears. Amen. In March
[47:20] of 1963,
[47:23] amen. And the same as there is darkness
[47:26] coming to denominational systems, there
[47:29] is light coming to the bride of Christ.
[47:32] Come on, church. What is light? Light is
[47:35] the word of God made manifest. That
[47:38] light is appearing to tell you
[47:41] Revelations 10 is going to be fulfilled.
[47:45] Malachi 4 is being fulfilled. Luke 17:30
[47:49] is being fulfilled. You see, the light
[47:52] of God is coming to the church. At the
[47:55] same time, darkness is coming to the
[47:57] natural church. And both of them is
[48:00] represented through ministry.
[48:02] That's why in Isaiah 60, the Bible says,
[48:05] "Arise and shine." Go to Isaiah 60 and
[48:08] and look in the fir first two verses and
[48:10] watch the scripture pull it up. Amen. It
[48:12] it's a beautiful reading. Amen. Isaiah
[48:15] chapter 60 and verse one. Arise and
[48:18] shine for thy light is come. Can I just
[48:20] resay it? Come up and reflect.
[48:24] Arise and shine. Come up and reflect for
[48:27] thy light is come and the glory of the
[48:30] Lord is risen upon thee. Watch the next
[48:32] verse. And for behold, the darkness
[48:35] shall cover the earth, and gross
[48:37] darkness the people. The Lord shall
[48:40] arise upon thee, and his glory shall be
[48:43] seen upon thee. Now, isn't it Isaiah 60?
[48:46] It's so powerful to see, amen, that when
[48:48] the enemy comes with darkness is when
[48:51] God is rising with light, but he's
[48:54] commanding the church, Amen, don't go
[48:56] back to the darkness. Look, when the
[48:59] light starts shining, Brother Man makes
[49:00] a he makes some very uh rude remarks
[49:03] about the light. He said, "But when the
[49:05] light shines," he said, "the roaches run
[49:07] into the dark and the beetles run and
[49:09] all the night creatures flee to the
[49:11] dark." He said, "Church, don't run to
[49:13] the darkness."
[49:15] Amen. We are children of the light. Walk
[49:18] out into the light of the resurrection
[49:20] of Jesus Christ in this age. This
[49:23] message has brought light. And when the
[49:25] message starts shining, watch what
[49:28] happens. They turn and run back into the
[49:30] darkness rather than the light. Turn and
[49:33] go back into the system. But the
[49:35] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[49:37] darkness the people. But I I I'm a Bible
[49:39] reader, brother Troy. I enjoy the Bible.
[49:41] And you watch Isaiah 60. There's two
[49:43] lights. But look in Isaiah 59 and watch
[49:46] the last two verses of Isaiah 59. He
[49:48] says, "When the enemy shall come in like
[49:50] a flood, that the Lord shall raise up a
[49:54] standard against him." Amen. When the
[49:57] enemy shall come like a flood. And here
[49:59] the pope is coming as a natural
[50:02] representation that the devil is putting
[50:05] the lights out of the church and
[50:07] plunging them into darkness and they'll
[50:10] walk into the tribulation by that
[50:11] darkness. At the same time, God sends a
[50:14] prophet of Malachi 4 to represent the
[50:17] light. He is a natural representation of
[50:21] the light that is coming in this age.
[50:24] And I say, amen, we are to walk in the
[50:26] light as he is in the light. This word
[50:29] of God that is coming into this age has
[50:31] birthed children of the light. We are
[50:33] not of the darkness. Amen. We are not
[50:35] living in the darkness. We are the
[50:37] children of the light of almighty God.
[50:40] God declares it in the heavens. I love
[50:42] it. I love how God does it. And he put
[50:45] his Life magazine. He put the pillar the
[50:49] the halo or the cloud. He put it in Life
[50:52] magazine. I thought that was pretty
[50:53] good. He put it in Life magazine because
[50:56] that's exactly what's coming out of this
[50:58] message is life. Life for change. Life
[51:02] for power. Amen. We are not a darkness.
[51:05] We are not of the darkness.
[51:07] We are of the light. Do you see? It's an
[51:10] event in history, amen, where Rome is
[51:13] now coming into, amen, the
[51:15] denominational systems, amen, to bring
[51:17] forth the old Jerusalem, to bring them
[51:20] under the power of the Pope in January
[51:22] of 1964. Folks, I I I'm I'm sorry, but
[51:26] these things But these things, I guess
[51:28] they're coincidences, you know,
[51:31] that the seals are opened and
[51:33] immediately the Pope comes
[51:37] to Jerusalem.
[51:39] The word is coming to the bride
[51:43] and the antichrist is coming to church
[51:46] natural.
[51:48] They're coming to a head at the same
[51:50] time. But you know, it'd be one thing if
[51:52] the pope just went to Jerusalem and put
[51:54] out the lights, but it's only in the
[51:57] same year of 1964, in October of 64,
[52:01] that that same pope, Pope Paul V 6th,
[52:05] visited America.
[52:07] Now folks, let me tell you now, now now
[52:10] Brother Brandham says in the church age
[52:11] book, it is no coincidence that his name
[52:13] is Pope Paul V 6th. He said Paul being
[52:17] the first messenger to the Gentiles, he
[52:20] said it has now returned back to
[52:22] Jerusalem under Pope Paul, but it's the
[52:25] number six because it's man visiting.
[52:28] Amen. Through Paul's ministry. Isn't
[52:29] that something? They come to put out
[52:31] Paul's gospel. But here, brother Brandon
[52:33] stands and he said, "Amen. Will I have
[52:36] to be judged? Amen. They said, "Yeah."
[52:38] He said, "Will Paul have to be judged?"
[52:40] He said, "Yeah." He said, "Well, then I
[52:42] have preached what Paul preached." And
[52:45] at the same time, Pope Paul V 6 is
[52:48] coming to destroy Paul's teachings among
[52:51] the church. Here comes a messenger from
[52:54] God to build up the New Testament church
[52:57] in the power of the gospel that was
[52:59] preached unto us by Paul. Amen. In fall,
[53:02] in 1964, in the fall, Amen. That same
[53:05] pope visits America. Now, y'all don't
[53:09] y'all don't don't get upset and think
[53:10] I'm reading too deeply.
[53:13] But he come to America
[53:17] in 1964.
[53:20] He come to America
[53:23] and landed brother
[53:25] Carrie at JFK airport.
[53:31] Do you know that there had been no
[53:32] Catholic presidents?
[53:35] But brother Bam said, "According to the
[53:37] vision, the women will get a vote and
[53:39] they'll put in the wrong man."
[53:41] And he said they did it when they put in
[53:43] John F. Kennedy. And he said, "It's not
[53:45] that he's not a bad man." He said, "But
[53:47] the Catholic system," he said, "got
[53:49] among the blacks and turned their vote
[53:51] from the Republican party of the Lincoln
[53:54] party, that freedom, and bought them and
[53:56] twisted that vote around to put in a
[53:59] Catholic man, John F. Kennedy." And he
[54:01] said, "Then he's a good man." And he
[54:03] said, "It won't look like very much, but
[54:05] he's making a way for it."
[54:09] He's making a way for it. Amen. And I
[54:11] thought it was so amazing. Amen. After
[54:14] Mr. Kennedy is passed away. Amen. They
[54:16] got a they got an airport, JFK airport,
[54:20] and that's the very place where this
[54:22] pope decides to land is on JFK. He made
[54:26] a way for that pope to land in America.
[54:30] I tell you, the symbology is amazing
[54:32] tonight to think, amen, that they made a
[54:34] way for that to return to America. And
[54:37] brother Ram said very clearly, he said,
[54:39] watch this. He said, I I want you to see
[54:41] it. He says, "When when when when you
[54:43] watch back and see this Revelations 13
[54:45] appearing in the Bible, you see you see
[54:47] them first eight and nine verses." But
[54:49] then when that second beast starts
[54:50] showing up, do y'all realize that they
[54:54] that they founded this America and they
[54:57] founded it. Brother Bram said, of
[54:58] course, according to Revelations 12, he
[55:00] said, "The woman fled into the
[55:02] wilderness, a place prepared, which was
[55:03] Plymouth Rock."
[55:04] Yeah.
[55:06] Come to Plymouth Rock. Right.
[55:09] Now, now think of this. And that was
[55:11] done in 1492 they discovered America.
[55:15] But in the middle of 1500s
[55:18] they settled Jamestown.
[55:20] Do you know that is with only a few
[55:22] years of settling James Town that the
[55:24] Lutheran denomination was formed.
[55:29] The second part of Revelations 13 was
[55:32] denomination organization in America.
[55:36] There never was any organization
[55:39] anywhere in the world other than the
[55:41] Catholic Church. He had no daughters
[55:44] until Lutheran born an organization
[55:48] and it happened at the same time America
[55:50] was founded.
[55:52] It took them a hundred aboutund maybe
[55:55] 200 years 150 years before they actually
[55:58] made it into America. But after that
[56:01] watch a swarm of organizations begin to
[56:04] move in America. So you seen the
[56:06] denomination give birth and brought that
[56:08] in under the revelations 13. Amen. But
[56:11] there they were moving in light. There
[56:13] they were. They would they would have
[56:14] systems and it would rise up again and
[56:17] they would have life and they would rise
[56:18] up again. But watch the scripture tell
[56:21] us that when it comes to the Leodysian
[56:23] age that they will be a darkness that'll
[56:25] settle over the earth of blackness and
[56:27] it'll darken everything out. that it'll
[56:29] be a gross darkness that'll cover the
[56:31] earth. And the only thing that'll
[56:34] survive that age is them that have their
[56:36] names in the lamb's book of life from
[56:38] the foundations of the world. What is
[56:40] it? God witnessed it in heaven. That
[56:43] there would be a place for light to come
[56:45] in this age. And to think God has chosen
[56:48] you in this generation, in the middle of
[56:51] this age, light has be shine and we have
[56:56] received it.
[56:57] Now, as we move in the back half of
[56:59] Revelations 13, oh, I thank God
[57:04] that there's a Revelations 10
[57:06] and a Luke 17.
[57:08] Yeah.
[57:10] And a Malachi 4.
[57:13] Brother Bram types it like this. He's in
[57:15] the sermon, Turn on the Light if
[57:17] musicians could come. He's in the
[57:18] sermon, Turn on the Light. And he said,
[57:20] "This darkness of this age," he said,
[57:22] "it it it it it it it reminds me of a
[57:26] man and his sister that went into a dark
[57:29] cavern over in Carlsbad, New Mexico."
[57:34] Has anybody ever been down in a cave?
[57:38] I think all the caves these days, they
[57:39] turn Anybody ever had the lights turned
[57:41] out on?
[57:43] Because they want to prove to you how
[57:44] dark it is. And I'm praying whoever's
[57:46] turning it out, they know how to turn it
[57:47] back on.
[57:50] cuz they get you way back there. And
[57:53] brother Brandham said, "When them lights
[57:54] went out, see what they're proving to
[57:57] you is how dark it would be
[58:00] without the light."
[58:02] And brother Brandham describes the age
[58:04] and the time.
[58:07] And he says, "Oh, brother Brandham," he
[58:09] said, "you're making it awful dark in
[58:10] here." He said, "But see, there's a man
[58:12] here
[58:16] that can turn on the lights.
[58:20] And
[58:20] there there is a man here that can turn
[58:23] on the lights. And let me say he's still
[58:25] here
[58:27] and he can still turn on the lights. Can
[58:29] you stand to your feet with me tonight?
[58:42] Two churches.
[58:44] There's two Jerusalems.
[58:49] We are the heavenly Jerusalem.
[58:51] Thanks be to God.
[58:55] I'm so glad that the light can shine on
[58:58] me.
[59:00] You know, tonight
[59:02] as we survey these things,
[59:06] I know I know we're living in a world
[59:08] where where people are
[59:11] there's people even right now, you know,
[59:13] making fun of us talking about this
[59:15] American pope and all this.
[59:18] But it's it's amazing to me
[59:22] that uh Seth actually wrote to me with
[59:24] me to church and we were listening to
[59:25] see not ever the shook
[59:28] and brother Bam started talking about he
[59:30] said the eagles of the day he said they
[59:32] have a seven course meal to feed on that
[59:33] fresh mana and he said but he said but
[59:37] see the hawks he said they won't receive
[59:40] it
[59:42] he said they're they're they're he said
[59:44] they gotten lazy and they want to just
[59:46] fly and sit on the high line and wait
[59:48] for somebody to kill a rabbit, you know,
[59:50] run over it or something and just fly
[59:51] down and get it. He said they don't want
[59:53] to they don't want to they don't want to
[59:55] get that fresh mana. They don't want to
[59:57] reach out into that land. And brother
[59:59] Ram said, "It's there. They just won't
[1:00:00] take it."
[1:00:02] And I I got to thinking, it's there
[1:00:06] if we'll take it.
[1:00:09] The scriptures are being manifested if
[1:00:11] we can if we can take it. That's right.
[1:00:13] Amen.
[1:00:14] We we got we have light shining current
[1:00:18] current revelation
[1:00:20] moving in the church. I've often told
[1:00:22] people they said, "Well, you don't have
[1:00:23] any scripture." I said, "Well, you just
[1:00:24] don't accept the scripture God give."
[1:00:28] Brother Bram said, "Why won't they take
[1:00:29] Malachi 4?"
[1:00:32] Because their denominations blacked it
[1:00:33] out.
[1:00:35] Why won't they take Luke 17? Because
[1:00:38] denomination blocked it out.
[1:00:40] Why won't they Why won't they take
[1:00:41] Revelation 10? We have tons of
[1:00:43] scriptures
[1:00:46] if you'll take them.
[1:00:49] I want to take them. How about you?
[1:00:51] Amen.
[1:00:52] I'm I'm a part of that. Amen. Brother
[1:00:54] Ben
