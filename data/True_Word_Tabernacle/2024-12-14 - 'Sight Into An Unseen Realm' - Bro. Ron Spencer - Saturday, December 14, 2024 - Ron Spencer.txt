I see a cloud like a and I know it's going to rain will I see a th like a a man I see a like a man will I see a cloud like a man well I know and I know it's going to [Music] rain well Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen you know there's a lot of symbology in that song and amen that's a story told of Elijah the prophet when he had when he had called fire down on Mount Carmel and the Vindicated promise of God had been made known he went up on the mountain because it' been three and a half years since the rain had came and he prophesied to King Ahab thus sayith the Lord it shall rain the one that said it wouldn't rain now is saying that it will rain and he went up there and sat down and he was old and tired and he didn't feel like going no further right so God supplied him a servant a messenger and he said to that messenger he said now go look toward the sea and tell me what do you see go give me your report so he went and look and he come he said I don't see nothing he said well you better look again the word said the rain's coming go look again and seven times he made him go look again because he he was sure of the Vindicated word of what had been spoken and that last time he came and that servant said to him so well I see a cloud out there about the size of a man's hand and that Prophet just seeing a cloud the size of a man's hand got so invigorated he got so revived and so renewed that he stood up and outran horses to the city of jezel and said cried out get out the buckets the rain is on the way I tell you I hope you brought a bucket with you tonight I hope you brought your barrel with you tonight I believe there's rain amen I believe it's time amen you know the prophet of God took that story and he said what happened there he said is that the prophet took the first move of it he took the first move of it and made the announcement no different than the man saw the water in the pool of Bethesda when he saw the movement the prophet said the first move of it he got in now if you come here tonight and you have a need your healing may be that first move of your healing may be just a whisper of of of something coming from that preacher when he says God can do certain certain thing and you feel that little thing flip over in you and say that's the truth that's the first move of it and what you are to do right then is begin to thank the Lord for the healing and you are to begin to say God I believe that I believe that's true you don't have to wait till the spirit sweeps you Plum off of your Pew to get started somebody say well I I'd like to have a blessing tonight you don't have to wait until the spirit takes you over if you got just the first little feeling of the Holy Spirit moving through your Pew reach out and get a hold of it amen and say God don't leave me here amen I want to hold on till he holds on don't you amen that's the way you hold on hold on till he holds on you get under it till you can't get out of it that's where I like to be in it amen I certainly believe it tonight and I believe there's an great opportunity and a great expectation in the house of the Lord amen we certainly enjoyed that service last night Brother David we so blessed by the word of the Lord that he brought to us and then amen tonight of course we have our brother Ron Spencer is here with us tonight he's uh such a blessing that he would share his time with us and sister Connie that they would come uh and so he he's he said tonight that he would uh would like to have a prayer line with you all of course you know that uh he his energy is not what it us used to be and he's fighting a battle so um so if he don't take time with every person that comes through so just just know that uh that God answers prayer amen and the holy spirit's here uh and bring prayer and so we're asking the Lord and some of you that come tonight uh you it's very possible that you be healed before you ever hit this prayer line with the expectation that you fill in this room right now where the word of God is being preached that healing may come to you right then don't you say well I need to wait to the prayer line if it comes to you in your Pew you take it right there and say Lord I want that healing in my body that's what we believe that's the way we believe it my oh it feels like the house of God in here tonight amen what an expectation for him and we want to give uh plenty of time for brother so uh tonight if he's going to come we want to thank him and sister uh Connie for coming and giving us of their time we want to

later and said brother Ron the Lord spoke to me five times for you to come well I already had the sermon so and I haven't preached it at home so I'm going to try it out on you amen so you know when God's in the orchestration of a meeting whether you're sitting in the front or you're sitting in the back you know he's here no matter what your age are where you're a teenager or the oldest person in the building so well brother Ron I'm almost at a place to where I'm losing my mind I'm getting so old I I'm am debilitated now you just don't know how dangerous you are to the devil come on cuz now you're at a spot to where Temptation doesn't bother you anymore come on and your only heart beats away from eternal life and you're a living legend and there's nothing that the devil can do hallu so don't think you're defeated you're almost home amen God bless you maybe you have a need on your heart tonight you just like say Lord would you pass by me just pass by me tonight One Touch from me just

how we love you with all of our hearts we have dedicated our life to you to serve you and I'd like to report you've never never disappointed me you've been with me on the mountaintops in the deepest of valleys you give us a strength with impossible odds every one of us here need a touch from you now you're the kind of God that knows exactly what we need whether sitting in the building or all the way across the earth now Lord we ask you to pass by our way Lord if we can get our minds off of what's going on today or tomorrow or next week or the trial that we're in and just realize like blind Bemus did this is my moment and I'm not going to let anybody stop me from my moment if we can come with that kind of expectation Lord I believe even for myself that I can walk out of here healed that's what I expect I expect anything from you now Lord I ask you to touch our hearts tonight and guide my mind and my thoughts and cause me to only stay in the channel never to leave even allow my human Spirit to get in the way touch this audience in this building Lord minister to this these Ministers of God and strengthen them today through these services in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen God bless you God bless you if you will turn with me to Hebrews chapter [Music] 11 I'd like to speak to you for just a bit on sight into an unseen Realm Hebrews chap 11 and verse 1 maybe somebody will come to me tomorrow and say well brother Wayne just spoke on that a couple of weeks ago and so amen so I'm sure he did a better job I would but I'm really pleased to be here Hebrews chap 11 and verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do do appear Einstein was asked about how things were created and he quoted that scripture right there now Zechariah Chapter 4 and verse 6 you don't have to turn there and then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying it's not by might and it's not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts you can be seated this evening we serve a special God I think we all know that by now we serve a very special God now he's the kind of God that this might might may not blow your away but he's the kind of God that that can take nothing and make something out of it he takes absolutely nothing right and make something out of it for proof look in the mirror Amen in Luke chapter 1 in verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto the city of Galilee named nazarus and to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came into her and said and hail Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou H has found favor with God I want that to be our testimony and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and and shall call his name Jesus amen now notice notice these next words and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and then said Mary unto the angels how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God now I I just want to say this to you all of us as Christians message Believers Christians around the world hinge our belief on a teenager's witness there was not a thousand people to Echo the story so you can imagine the bloggers of that day right let me just go another step Isaiah 7 and verse1 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel amen now no doubt Isaiah was preaching and as he's preaching he's exhorting the word and this quote drops out he's a man can you imagine the enemy fighting with him he has just spoken something impossible let me just say impossible he has just spoken something that is not natural to humanity and now he's spoken a prophetic word that will now circle the Earth for hundreds of years he'll never sit it right he'll never sit it but he will believe that that was not me speaking that was not me speaking or some school's thought speaking that was God spoke Through Me Genesis 3 and verse1 15 now God is speaking I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel let me just give you another scripture while we're here Revel S 5 and verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof it no man in heaven or nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book and neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof I've taken just a couple of moments of your time to to take some scriptures and place them together of course I didn't do it the boss did put them together they would not mean much in a Baptist Church they would not mean much at any ecumenical school but to the people of the open book because of your sight yeah has been opened listen and don't never take that for granted your sight was open to where that not a another school throughout the ages was to able to open the book and figure to decode the scriptures and what's placed here and what's placed there it's always a puzzle and they did their very level best especially during the the man age to try to open the book but only the author and he couldn't open the book to people 400 years ago because you wasn't here so never allow the enemy to tell you that you're a nobody because you're a people of a special class a special designation Brother David read portion of this last night night and and he and I just would like to go back and read it again he says and he commanded his church to lift up their heads and end that day and and to look up for the Unseen Christ will be appearing pretty soon if we only walk by sight we would be children of darkness and sure enough now he said I'm glad so glad to know that there is a light that shines in every believer's heart until the Eternal day when Jesus shall come now it is a lesson to us to look at what Abraham did then not only to did did he believe it but he made ready for it he made preparations for this child that he saw by faith 25 years before the child ever came because he had considered that he he who told him was able to keep the promise that he had told him he didn't consider his own nature being a hundred years old his physical being or he did not consider at all the deadness of Sarah's womb of his wife Sarah and the writer of the Divine commentary tells us he staggered not at the the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving glory to God what a person and what a place for brother brandom to say this in the book called looking at the Unseen I think I think when it comes to this season people get all religious they put a lot of different things together where you love it or whether you hate it that I'm not here to settle that for you but I I just presented something to you a little while ago that we are all hinging on the testimony of one now we're a people that have been gathered and this message is what brought us all together and we believe that a messenger met an angel in a cave and it's a testimony of one and then we believe that he that he met seven angels and it's the testimony of one but always remember it's more than just a testimony but there's results that comes with it are you with me the reason that we can believe that it was not just Mary but Mary believed it and then by believing it it be to manifest in her body and listen the birth of this child shook the earth a lot of babies are born every day but the birth of this child shook the Earth because in another realm that Dark Realm was watching for that light to be born cuz he had heard Isaiah 7 he had watched through Abraham and he stood there in the Garden of Eden and judged so he watched for that one to come so he knew when this girl begins to testify and a baby comes to life at his name that he knew that he was in trouble and he also knew that if this child being virgin he was going to cleanse God's mankind all the way back to the Garden not just all the way back to the Garden but all the way to here you know when we begin to think of the S things of sight some of us wear glasses some of us are nearsighted some of us are farsighted some of you got perfect eyes and until you get 40 to 50 years old and every one of us see differently we all see differently if you don't believe that look who you married and I hope you get up every day and say you are the most beautiful woman in the world you didn't do that today do it now are you with me are you with me every day you tell her I love you you're special amen you you stepped out of Eternity into time and you spend this little hickey of time together one day you'll step back into eternity again and share eternity together brother R have had a bad marriage it was your choice I'm not here to fix that for you it's your choice you fix that next week you fix that next week now we're taught that this message is an eagle message and an eagle has an eye like no other bird as a as an incredible eye I'm not going to spend long on it but an eagle can see its prey three miles away yeah in exact detail yeah knows exactly where it's at what's going on with its surroundings that's a phenomenal thing as Believers your eyes have come open with isap that you're able to see things and we were trained and and you you guys are almost Bible scholars because of the message you were given a prophet that is a Seer and not just a Seer but he was allowed to look into things that no other messenger was ever allowed to look into and it wasn't just for his benefit it was for your benefit it allows the ministry in this age we've got young ministers sitting here listen you don't have to take your entire lifetime to figure things out in just a matter of a just short time you're preaching things that men spent their entire life trying to figure out because of the sight that you have been given now let's not discredit anything to someone that's blind right I just want to give you an example God fixes that as well and the best example I could give you is a lady named Fanny Crosby now listen she she lived in a realm towar that she was poverty stricken she was extremely poor but she was extremely anointed can we say that she was one of the best songwriters that ever lived and she refused to sell her gift to to the world she would go to a single prison meeting and someone would scream out Don't Pass Me By and she would write a song that when many of us came to the altar savior savior but she would also be be made fun of to where that they would say how will you know him you've been blind all your life how will you know it and As She's Walking Away she said I shall know him I shall know him by the nail prints in his hands one of her testimonies is is is I'm thankful that I didn't see the light of day so my my eyes come open the first thing that I see will be my [Music] Jesus I would say that sight Way Beyond Humanity sight am amen would you agree with that now let me just let me just touch into something right here you are you are a vision of God and being a vision of God God thought of you I couldn't put it any better than last night but God thought of you before the foundation of the world yeah and you realize that when God thought of you he will never unthink of you I want you to think about that in your darkest season God never unthink God never gets in a crisis God never gives up on you he doesn't allow the temporary condition that you're in so quit beating yourself up on the the temporary Horrors that you're going through God saw way past the horrors of this moment let me just drop something cuz I just felt something let me just say your dark storm that you're going through right now if you could only see the Rainbow on the other side God is allowing you to go through incredible storms to to give you Victory when you get through the other side there has never been a miracle without a mess are you with me there's always a reason for the storm that you're going through are you with me now Isaac was blind and no doubt wondered why I'm blind but he had to be blind to bless Jacob he staggered he no doubt fell many times as an old blind man but he would have never in his Humanity ever blessed Jacob are you getting it now he was a stinker he was a rascal he was a booger are you with me no doubt Satan looks at some of the people that sitting in this building say God is this your best yes yes this is my best cuz God sees something that the devil devil can't see it's a predestinated seed that he put there God takes nothing and make something out of it right you know I don't know particularly how many times Mary told the story that she met an angel but we have no recording of anybody else walking the same path saw the same Angel we have we have no recordings oh yeah he was six foot tall he was dark complected hair down to his shoulders he was standing there had a Radiance about him had a certain way that he spoke no the only person that said that was a was a girl yeah and and let me just say we have nowhere in thist scriptures that said that he went to a thousand women before he picked Mary are you with me so he bypassed a million to get to where you are and you're sitting in a meeting maybe you're sitting here tonight for your first night and you go well it's an accident I just told my family I would go and and I'm there and I'm here now and and that pull that's on your heart it's not the humanity God watched over you way before you was ever born so we're here to declare the vision of God brother Brandon would use a statement he said you're the living physical attributes of God that God thought of before the foundation of the world so God literally brings you out of total chaos and darkness and illuminates the light to live on the inside of you and you know when you was in control of your life you were just constantly in a mess and the enemy will tell you back in the good old days there was nothing good don't buy that load of nonsense they was not good old days am well back when I was in charge of this body yeah you was a mess you couldn't keep your story straight you were constantly into trouble you were doing things you was one choice to another choice and but when God begin to get a hold to your life and begin to straighten you up sure it's a process he took a long time to get you here he just don't go poof and you're on that's right it's a process it's a birth it's a mess and some of you still at work in it and remember God can only use what you surrender some of you can only surrender 10% of your life or 20% of your life some 100 but the more you surrender to your life the more he can use yeah are you with me now a't it wonderful now I know all of you know the squirrel story and so brother brandham tells it over and over again doesn't change the details of it and it's almost like you you've heard this you were there you know go to the place that you call Sportsman holler you call Sportsman and he goes there and begins to talk to him how many what are you hunting for squirrels how many would you like to have and he said three and I'm just going real quickly here and he and he begin to where would you like it at and he begin to speak something out of nothing are you with me he began to speak something out of nothing this was another level that's right this was another level and he begins to speak creation and he's speaking it's not 100 people watching it's a prophet and God and he's showing how it operates now he's not doing this just for brother Brandon he's doing this for you and he shoots the first one and then he shoots the second one and and he said I thought you said three has to remind him you said three and he said I thought I would I thought I would pick a place to where that would be impossible where a squirrel wouldn't be have him to come down this way and he was picking an impossible situation have you come down this way and be there and be in that spot and he shot him are you with me now here we are operating in the third pull this is a level Way Beyond anything that anybody else has been a a part of and notice who's with him the enemy and the enemy begins to tell him why the woods are full of squirrels the woods are full of squirrels he tries to get rid of the supernatural immediately because if this story gets out it can create spontaneous combustion there will be a people that actually believe that they can step into that and live an overcoming life now we don't need squirrels we just need to [Applause] overcome so the enemy's there with him and I it hit me not long ago it hit me that brother brandham hunted till 12:00 just to prove the enemy wrong but remember he asked for three not a dozen and so he sits there you know in the prophet's time is important too and he sits there just to prove to the enemy you're wrong there's going to be some quiet times that the enem is whispering in your ear just sit there and prove to the enemy the enemy say in the woods full of squirrels did another one show up brother biscos and we just shared this earlier they didn't know it was in my notes brother bisc said that had those horns been 42 in and a quarter a quarter I wouldn't have he said I wouldn't even be here but they was exactly 42 in that's right listen there's not another Ministry on the earth that has these kind of indications now if you remember when that that animal's killed the vision is only half complete and they're going down off of the mountain and brother brandham asked do you see that grizzly bear and and and you know the story that I don't brother Bud says I don't see him I I can look for miles and I see him nowhere and brother brand I'm actually ask him are you doubting the vision I so I wonder sometimes do we sit in church and doubt the supernatural oh we can get the intellect and the A's and the B's and the pluses and the we can get the mechanics all worked out we can be as legalist as we can possibly be we can be as hard knock as we can be I'm here it's me and my four and no more but listen you are the people that are designed not just for miracle over cancer but your body is going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an [Applause] eye so we are in the season of Supernatural That's Right amen are you with me don't get caught in the season of manage to where everything has to be dotted eyes and crossed te cuz Faith is another real this is for a faith Way Beyond the common cold or Way Beyond cancer Way Beyond the demon spirit that you're fighting with Way Beyond that because your promise is you get a body [Music] [Applause] change and yes your enemy is at the same point like he was with brother Brandon with three squirrels ah you know everybody believes in a Rapture everybody but somebody's going to take [Applause] it somebody's going to step into it somebody's going to look in the mirror and they're not gray-headed anymore and they won't need glasses and they won't be stoop shouldered how would you like to been Abraham's neighbor I'm sorry I'm taking time but how'd you like to been Abraham's neighbor and he's testified for decades now Sarah and myself are going to have a child yeah you've laughed you've you've went along with him he's a friend you saw the blessings that's with him one night you say good night you look across the fence old stoop shouldered man is worshiping over there he goes to bed and he gets up and he must have had visitors cause a young man comes out of the door and now he's really shouting and a female walks out of the door she's really shouting what about your neighbors do they know there's a change coming I want to ask you do you really believe it is this message just more than poetry to you brother Alex if it's just a if it's just a story we've missed the whole picture I I'm sorry but I just feel L I'm just going to challenge you just a little bit here so so I'm going to come to your I'm com to come right here just for a moment you've seen some things I've been a part of some things yesterday I was invited to brother Aiden sister Mary's house and we had dinner together I wish you all could have been there but was a small kitchen and so it wouldn't fit it was an awesome meal but it was a very emotional meal for me very emotional time and I tried not to show it much but as brother Wayne would take me to their greenhouse and I would see that for the first time I would walk in and the boys are working I would see that for the first time you see I was there when brother Aiden came up for prayer and he was praying for his back then he was just in short order he told me that had no work couldn't make provide for his family we begin to pray you remember we begin to pray this has never happened to me ever before and not since in the middle of that prayer I stopped and I asked him what's your hobby and he and he said we have a little Greenhouse he didn't tell me how big his Greenhouse was but I just prayed God will you bless his Greenhouse now we believe for three squirrels and you're you're walking in a vision yeah I don't know what your company plan is I have no idea I don't know family businesses and I don't want to but I don't I I want to Adventure without a with maybe some Authority here but I want to tell you boys and your family you stay in that Vision because when God is your partner you better have big plans now this is what I heard now you you shared this with me and I hope I get it right we're talking about building a church and you were talking that with brother Aiden and and you were sharing some things that I had told you and brother Aiden responded to you you won't build it big enough that's silly brother Ron listen how big is your god I want you to think about it how big is your god brother Ron had sitting over here he had had some dismal years in business and and he he began to he began to hear me preach about if God is your partner you've been have big plans and we sat at dinner here not long ago and he said brother brother Ron I've been I my business has been blessed more than it's ever been blessed thank how big is your god brother Ron you're you're all of a sudden going into Prosperity uh I don't know if you know this or not but your God owns the cattle on a thousand hills [Applause] is that all right is that right well brother Ron I don't I don't know so much about how all that works listen God does it I there's no man does any of that I remember standing in the same building and it was in a prayer line and and Anna came for prayer and she'd had some Mis marriages I didn't tell brother Wayne at the time that I saw a vision of that baby Eevee is she here yeah yeah there she is yeah well you're holding Miracle number two I don't mean to ask you anything but would you stand up there's people outside of the building maybe watching and they might be critical but is't that correct and how many times you went through life and cycles of life and you went and the enemy said it's not going to happen it's not going to happen I'm telling you the truth it's not going to happen it's not going to and you got disappointed month after month after month is that right where you're holding happenings I was standing I was stand how does these things work well I I just well I'm just not going to apologize for it I'm riding with a preacher overseas and I I'm riding with him and and he's taken me out in the country of course I've never been there and he's taking me and he takes a ride and it's on a gravel road and I said I've been here before he said oh brother Ron you've never been here before and I said yes I have I've been here before he said no no you've never been here I said we're going to go down here and we're going to take a right and when we take a right we're going to turn into a a little farm and I said we're going to turn in and on the right there's a barn and the man is going to be on his knees and there's a yellow dog going to be with him and he's going to be working on a bulldozzer and there's silver tanks or silver stainless steel tanks in another barn he's going to take us over to show he said you've been here and we turn in and we turn to the barn go to the barn there's that yellow dog comes out to greet us there's the brother on his knees he's working on he's working on that bulldozzer you know if you have a bulldozer you got to work on those things and after a few moments he said I'd like to take y'all over and show you the what the yield of this year and he takes us over and the the big stainless steel tanks are there and I'm just standing there and I'm just kind of reeling and I've been here before you said well brother Ron that's they ja Vu no no no I I'm actually this is a trick so you hang right with me and so I I'm realing in that I've been here before I've stood here before I remember this because I've wrote it down and I'm here and I'm enjoying Fellowship on Sunday morning I speak in the meeting and I begin to speak on the four ordaining of God of how God for ordains things and he sees it way before we ever get there now whether you can see a vision or whether you can't I want to bring you into a vision tonight are you with me brother Ronda have you ever seen a dream how many's had a dream oh yeah how many goes to sleep I had a dream last night it was uh it may not mean nothing but I I dreamed I was with brother Jim bab and we was cleaning something on a roof I don't know why you'd be cleaning anything on the roof nothing spiritual here now folks and and and he's and he's talking to me and I'm slipping and Brother David I'm slipping down the I'm slipping down the roof and and I just tell him brother Jim's been going on now a few years and and I'm slipping down the roofs and he's telling me he said you got to hang on you got to put pressure on I said listen back in my normal life I didn't wear ever wear sandals he said you'll get used to them well I'm slipping and I'm going down and I'm going down and I'm I I keep going down he said you're such a rookie listen I woke up trying to keep my food on that roof and Connie asked me said what you doing I said I'm cleaning a roof can I tell a couple more I'm not trying to make myself anything but I want to tell you how big is our God how big is our God we're after the meeting at brother viscos at brother Tom rays and we're standing at brother Tom Ray's living room and we're backed up beside of a of a fireplace and brother Murphy Wong is standing with me and and we're just standing there we we're not we're just talking life and I said brother Murphy I see a vision of a baby and he's thinking not me he's thinking not me but what he didn't realize is his daughter they would come to find out that she was impossible for her to have a child but God was showing them I see past now I'm going to preach to you I see past your impossibilities are you with me so somewhere in British Columbia tonight there's a baby that was an impossibility Zach has a baby in his hand that was an impossibility I have a grand child that was an impossibility that's right are you with me now is't he wonderful I mean isn't he wonderful so it's not enough just for the prophet to see it but do you see it it just wasn't enough for the word to come open but can you see it now I would assume that all of you have keys to your house amen amen I would assume or you have a little button that you push you have a little button that you push it and so the other day I was at at the Ford dealership for my daughter to pick up their Ford truck and they had never accessed that little panel of buttons on there of numbers and they had locked the keys in the truck and I had went there I drove 30 minutes to Pi pick it up I would I wouldn't if this if this didn't work out I was going to have to drive 30 minutes home and then 30 minutes back and so I walk into the to the guy I said Hey listen I'm in a situation I really don't want to drive home and drive back here and there's a there's a numbers panel on the on the door and I said they didn't set that up and he said well I can't do anything for you and I said well get me somebody else so an old fellow came over and I said listen I know when it came from the company when it came from the company there's got to be numbers that were punched into that to see if it would work and he said well let me search the history of that truck when it was built and he said maybe in the identification they've got the numbers there and he was there about 30 seconds he said here's your number that's right I walked out and punched the numbers in there took a picture of it made sure that I wouldn't forget it I punched the numbers in there and got in started the truck and drove it home listen many of you said in Baptist churches and all different kind of churches and you had numbers in there there was a seed that was inside of there and you thought you were in the right spot you thought everything was okay until the light shined in the darkest of places and you realize you was a diamond in the chaos of night and you couldn't see past the storms or the chaos or the religion that you was in but one day God gave you access to see yourself in the vision listen folks is all you saw was William brandom you missed the picture if all you saw was Revelations 10:1 you missed the picture you've got to see yourself you got to see yourself in it and God sent you here with purpose not just to see if he could do it he sent you here with purpose he came 2,000 years ago with purpose brother Ron I I sometimes can't figure it out the scripture specifically says that Mary pondered these things in her heart I'm going to take you over something and that just a few things that listen God gave me this in September so don't think this is a Christmas message I can feel that booger besides that how many Christmas messages did brother Brandon preach and I love every one of them we have seen his star why we're little Bethlehem why it had to be Shepherds God caused the government to change because Joseph had to go to Bethlehem you're talking about a new Administration good forced taxation I'm talking about sight now yeah brother brandham says that the whole way Joseph fussed I'm not a way out of the place he grumbled and complained and that brute my wife is nine months and she's on the back of a donkey heart said no doubt incredible difficult things against the leader you can fuss about Biden for a few more weeks go ahead and do it you got a license figured it was CU We're Men We're Men We do not like change right go ahead you put your toothbrush in a certain spot your key is in a certain spot but God's word said that baby's got to be born in Bethlehem so I'm going to force you Joseph could not see the vision you was in another church but you wasn't getting fat and so you said here and I'm not going to go there but you said here and go why am I here God forced you he created circumstances in a certain way moved you here than no hotel and on the way there they stop for a water break and she tells him I've been watching a star come together it's a following us she's not the only one watching there's an assembly of angels that are gathering let me let me just say you're not not just in a Saturday night meeting if you could see the Unseen realm that is gathering Russia's doing what she is our government's doing what they are Sodom is doing what it is Rome is taking her place Israel's definitely doing what they're supposed to be doing they're fighting for their rival listen don't bet against Israel cuz they're in the vision listen all of Hell better not bet against us we're Unstoppable we're undefeated we're unmovable we're unchange and there's nothing that hell has got that can stop us from fulfilling the vision of [Applause] God I'm not talking about your Humanity there either cuz your Humanity will want to give up over and over again but there's a seed that is inside of you God's Got Confidence in that [Applause] [Music] seed are you with me that seed came from him and he's got confidence in himself that he put on the inside of [Applause] [Music] you and if you can realize it you are as Eternal as God is [Applause] eternal need a quote need a scripture Paul said that be absent from this body is to be present from the Lord cut my head off do what you want to I can't lose I'll borrow it from Billy Graham who borrowed it from a lot of other people if you hear Ron Spencer die don't you believe it for a minute cuz I will be more alive there than I ever have been [Applause] here my precious wife sets she's been a real trooper you're talking about a trooper she's been a trooper and she's heard very difficult things through this journey and I'm talking about difficult things and she always walks out of there and said we believe another report and we have been walking out of that cancer center for five years with doctors telling us giving us times and limits and this is going to happen and that's going to happen and this is going to happen your organs are now turning against you and your body's is is wore out and it's tired and these things are happening to you your numbers are looking bad and she'll just go we believe another [Applause] report I I'm not going to be much longer now you know as long as it's somebody else well your faith is up and courage is full your is you're can you can fight Tigers you can kill a bear you're quoting David you're you're thinking about all different kind of men like Daniel and mesach and Shadrach and abedo but you just let the tables turn to you and it becomes your turn and you just hear the doctor say I I think you might have cancer your world will fall apart it'll literally fall apart and the doctor's just said a couple of sentences he's only throwing it out just for the might be and and it's somewhere just those words have power in them power of unbelief and they begin to go they haven't found a drop of cancer yet they have done no biopsies they have done no x-rays they've done nothing but just those words begin to shatter your word world can somebody say amen and then it begins to turn and it goes and goes and goes maybe they take a a biopsy and then after about four or five days they send you word that you we have found cancer cells and now we're going to have to begin to fight listen cancer doctors are incredible they're incredible people they're they're in a different world and and they just have such a such a a burden for you to help you and pray with you and give you strength and because it's a horrible battle and let me just say you got cancer here tonight let me just say that to you I I want you to appreciate the doctors and the nurses that are on your team but aren't you glad that you've got an angel of God you got a God that stands there that is faithful and you watch with your your naked eye you watch help me preach you watch your body begin to deteriorate and your muscles begin to fall apart and and your bones begin to deteriorate your mind gets cloudy and and listen the treatment is sometimes worse than the disease and you go through it because you just you go through it and you believe the word of God let me just say you're never a loser people say well brother Ron you're an inspiration to so many let me just say that inspiration is God cause without him we'd all be in trouble he's the one gets me out of the bed he's the one that keeps me focused I just trust him that's what he asked me to do if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before thank you Lord praise God man told me he said I don't believe in the Supernatural message believe I said how can you believe this message well I can't believe those stories well listen I've got a better one than this coming if you stick around a little while from listen I'm 63 I'm going to be 18 [Applause] we are all the same age Ray and I are the same Brother Ray and I I'm sorry are the same age I'm not going by what you see the brandom is laying in his bed he's got his hands behind his head and the enem is talking to him about hadn't done anything listen brother brandom hadn't done anything at that point of life I quit I quit he's affected hundreds even millions of people some of the most phenomenal Miracles ever happened in humanity he's been a part of he was standing near when it happened I wasn't the one you you you know those scrip those quotes he's ask him would you like to see beyond the curtain of time the wall colors never change changed the bed covers never changed but he stepped into another realm are you with me and he began to see things that you and I can't see but because he was a prophet Seer he allowed us to look with him and we heard him say converts they're your converts are they all brand no they're your converts and a 95y old woman walks up and she's in the flower of her youth others come up and hug him and women came and hug him and why you know by Brother brand he never let women hug him but there was no sensation there I talked to you about a dream a little while ago and you get the emotions of a dream you get emotions cuz it takes you somewhere but brother brandom was in a realm that was more real than this realm we talk about future home listen it's already in the preparation because we heard the author of the book said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions brother man said that wasn't brick and stone and mortar he's prepared you a body right are you with me you'll never need that chair Charlie [Music] anymore you don't need those glasses anymore brother brandom Harley wanted to come back to this realm we were at a funeral my father's funeral and the man that was taking care of my father's funeral told me and my my boys and brother Tim PR we all could take 10 minutes a piece I know what you're thinking brother Tim was sitting beside of me and he punched in his clock on his iPad 10 minutes minutes and he got up and he began to speak about when Jesus called Lazarus back from the tomb and he said Jesus wept he began to talk about more than just it was more than just their unbelief but he said Jesus knew that he was calling him back to this world yeah and the world that he was in what it was like but calling him back to this world heartache politics sickness and he said Jesus wept that he had to call him back here and brother Jonathan as he be to say that as he said I didn't want to call him back and that clock went 9:57 9:58 and he just closed his iPad and stepped over and he looked over at me and said I didn't I have to be honest with you I had never saw it like that I be honest I had never saw the scriptures quite like that but a minister of God had been allowed to see something when brother Wayne steps to the pull pit and he just takes things that you've heard for decades and all of a sudden you go I never saw it like that I never saw it like that cuz God wants to increase your vision we're preparing to have a prayer line so I'd like to just turn our thoughts just for a moment there was a congressman went to a meeting and he had been in a spot to where that he needed help walking for decades decades now maybe just because of other hundreds of people wor going he was influenced to come but something caused him to be there something moved him to be there now he wasn't there when the angel told Brother brandham you'll pray for potentates and Kings ambassadors when the angel was in the cave he didn't call Congressman upshaw's name but he knew that prophecy would intercept with time and so brother brandom's preaching the meeting he's been called to preach the meeting and he's standing there and he comes to a certain place and I see a man and he begins to give him descriptions I I don't need to tell you the story but a man begins to read respond it's like an inspired word to an inspired seed and as the word Goes Forth all of a sudden you begin to go that's the truth and you begin to realize I am the man that's in the vision I'm not going to be in a wheelchair no longer I'm not going to be handicapped now let me just take you back to another part of the sermon brother brandom leaves honey and he goes to the poorest person in his church and she doesn't realize that she's going to step into an eternal situation and he's telling her about hunting and what the angel told and those three squirrels and how it all happened and she just responds and in her response something came out of nothing now you can argue all you want to of how those boys what they did I don't know their history but let me just say this to you if two boys ever is in heaven those two boys will be she stepped into a realm a supernatural anointing hit her a PL is delay brother brandham starts walking looks in the window which way should I go sees a police officer just starts walking and he walks by a woman good morning good morning ay good morning Parson how'd you know I was a paron early this morning I was praying now she sees herself in the vision and she likened herself to a character in the scriptures I be like the sudoite woman where is my Elijah you can take this and preach months brother random will tell brother bisc that that woman used the same power that he used to speak the storm out of existence she used that power to speak a storm into existence you think your need's not important the enem is whispering in your ear there's squirrels everywhere can you imagine Mary The Whispers in her ear and she held the testimony strong when there was rumors going around and they were wanting to rock her and kill her and Joseph has to protect her that's an illegitimate baby that you're carrying around and Simeon and Anna comes rejoicing and everybody else is throwing a fit it depends on what you see you took a picture of us before service I told you a story is it okay to tell that story won't you stand you don't probably don't want none of that he didn't know this story so I'm I'm overtime but you get you get paid more for overtime anyway and so I was preaching that morning and I didn't even know this man was in the building and I was preaching on how that God uses men and brother bcll called my wife when I was in one hospital and my son was in another one and the doctors was saying I wouldn't live I I was going to die because of the fire my lungs were burned up and brother bisco said God woke him up and said that that I would be the speaker next year at the Bible Way camp camp meeting I would be the speaker not just attend but I would be the speaker listen Connie was the one hearing I was dying and they were standing there telling him that that I wouldn't live through the day and she has heard a preacher that has talked to a higher source and she would go three weeks holding the testimony she was looking at a man on a on a respirator and they it was at 100% and it wasn't keeping up but God was saying he'll be the preacher next year brother rayi was telling that was rehearsing that story how that God speaks through men he still does a man walked into your office and he stepped into that office he began to tell me that this message wasn't right it had so many questions to it and he be to go and go and you give a cow enough rope they'll strangle theirself and he just began to go and go and tell me all that kind of stuff and and he after he got done he said to I'm going to be out of here I said just a moment I saw a vision I said just a moment we're going to walk through this door and we're going to walk out of that door and when we walk out of that door there's going to be a line for preachers and there's going to be a man there with a with a camera and he's going to take our picture and you're going to be stuck standing right beside of me and you might want to forget this entire day and this entire service but God's going to have a picture of you how do you know that to be the truth I said I saw a vision of it we walked out of that door and out of that door and there he stood and about 10 preachers standing there in a lineup and I stood there and I said you stand here Satan you're going to have your picture taken you brought cancer and God's going to hold you responsible you brought sickness and God's going to hold you responsible you brought all different kind of things and trial to of life God's going to hold you responsible here's the curity [Applause] I want to challenge you see past what you see see past what you see with your Naked Eyes get past the darkness of your depression and nonsense that the enemy's fighting you with this is more than just another Saturday night my prodical are in a mess can you see them sitting here beside of you can your faith rise enough until they're fighting the message that's just what you see brother Ronnie if you could just see where they're at now it doesn't matter where they're at now that don't matter that don't make God nervous whatsoever it don't make that don't make them nervous yeah but brother Ron they did all these kind of sins that don't make him nervous his blood his blood has the power to cleanse the worst sickness in the world the worst sins in the entire world I don't know how you came tonight I don't hear what your condition is I I'm not a prophet that's not my job it's way above my paker but I just know this he that told me that I would preach this sermon and I'm his representative he can do the work and I just know this about God he's never failed you quoted it last night one grain of sand I've been with all of you when we faced impossible Lots I've been with all of you I've been a Brother David I've been a part of your life in the since the beginnings I was with you the night and I was preaching the night I told you don't interpret this God's calling you to preach he's calling you to Pastor listen there was people in the audience gave me criticism that after the service you don't know this but they met me and told me all kind of nonsense all I know was if God saw it who am I to unsee it I don't care H I don't care where this goes either I don't care how many critics no man called David mayor to preach Ron Spencer didn't call him to preach I was only there and listen the god that called you will be there under every pressure under every situation I'll finish with this I saw brother Wayne here and I saw it blessed now when God shows you something he don't say you know I I I maybe shouldn't have said it like quite like that listen when God sees something and shows you something you can't unsee it now I'm coming to you when God begins to deal with your heart and begins to lead you into the way of Salvation then the Satan begins to battle against you don't let your Humanity unsee what God had showed you I don't care what trial you're going through God's got the answer the house was destroyed it's only a temporary place if you could see the house that he's got for you a matter of fact you can't buy one in this County or in this area like what God's prepared for you Ron and fighting disease I don't know how I'm going to get out of it let let me just say this to you if you could just see past what you're fighting listen I I want to I want to just caution you here this is not a motion this is not a tech talk right this is not this is not just somebody coming putting some as's and B's together for you a service can change your life and you're never the same the rest of your lives are you with me now what makes these men so special is because they see you as a diamond because God shows them that yeah and you yet you're the woman at the well and the devil's whispered in their ear you'll never do nothing with them you'll never do nothing with them and they're going by the word of God and they see you mature and you begin to see what they see and then they hear Echoes of rumors of other people well I don't even like her being in the church I don't like him being in the church can we take a moment to see what God sees can we take a moment to see what God sees because if we can see what God sees we're undefeatable what a thought what a thought thought hallelujah what I thought amen beautiful picture I put this note on the very end I find it absolutely amazing that brother Ray has been given the length of Life yeah and the powerful preacher that he is and I'm talking about powerful but no doubt he preached to 10 and 20 people and struggled and struggled and go from service to service to service he couldn't see a Wayne on on he was just trying to find his own children in the picture but if he could look back to where he was and to look to where he is stupid devil it call guys like you Legends no matter what the devil whispering in your ear at this point you're in a you're in a dangerous spot Brother Ray I'm just going to put you right on notice Brother Ray is in a dangerous spot for the Devil he's in a really dangerous spot money won't buy him women won't buy him a bigger house won't buy him religion won't buy him he has sold out he has run race we expected you to see the Rapture brother race so don't get in a hurry to go anywhere why'd you do that brother Ron there's young people here don't know what the cost that he had to go through the cost of what these guys have had to go through to be you're only looking with naked eyes if you could really see the victories and why'd you do all that brother Ron because I think sometimes we walk into a service at Saturday night you look at your clock and go he's preached he's preached an hour and a half I want to ask you did you get it did you get it you with the pink tie right there little guy yeah come here yeah come on up here with me I like to talk to people shorter than me I don't know what you see but this is Satan's worst nightmare what's your name Gabriel named after an Angel that's why you'll be tall dark complected handsome you were named after Angel so it's fitting that you will look like one who your parents whoa I come to a meeting I don't know anybody sister Connie comes to a meeting she knows whose cousins who's so maybe I should have consulted Connie before this exercise so what happens as you grow up in a preacher's home there's something that Satan knows if you really get this you will be a nightmare to the to the kingdom of hell you will be an absolute Nightmare and you roll out of their bed and you go on your knees how old are you 15 13 jesz that's cheap you're you're 13 years old you're 13 years old you go I don't know if I'm doing it for the kingdom of God but you begin to pray and you pray for peace and you pray that God strengthens you and you pray for more of the Holy Ghost you're not gaming you're not looking at bad things and you're shaking the kingdom of hell and Sodom is nowhere getting close to you and you're shaking the kingdom of Hell at 13 years old and you go Ah that's just a kid you're not seeing the picture did you get it you're not listen it's more than just a guy with a with a with that color with that color tie on listen you if you all you saw was a guy in this beautiful jacket and that color of tie you missed the picture this guy like you is a nightmare [Music] man thank you can I take about 30 more seconds brother Ron I don't believe in prayer lines I I don't think they're needed let me explain to you I could spend the next week telling you the mirac that I've saw walking through prayer lines cancer going to die in the next couple of days right and living today Living Well cancer free a lady carrying a dead baby going to take the baby on Tuesday and listen comes through the prayer line and a healthy baby is born listen don't let your unbelief block your vision the scripture said that these signs shall follow them that believe I don't know how many ministers that we have here but listen we are told that when we lay hands on the sick that there is a light between these hands and your body it isn't because of the man it's because of the word of God and the promise of God we can't heal you but the healer's in the house I can't have the vision for you but if you can see past your trial with me let's bow our heads now Heavenly Father what an anointing is in this room what an atmosphere is here we tell these stories and not to embellish any of them but to show how bigger God is you have proved yourself faithful and Lord you gave me these words instructions to preach I don't know who's sick and who's not but all I know is for myself I believe I can see past cancer see past organs that are not functioning well I'm accepting meetings for next year because I believe I I'll be here to preach them I'm not looking at what doctors tell me I'm looking at what your word says now father I've did everything that I know possible to speak to your children that have needs to increase their faith not in a man but in our Lord Jesus Christ now father we ask you that you touch them tonight as ministers I ask you that you would anoint us we've laid aside time to pray because we know these services are specially incredibly important and all we ask Lord Jesus is to confirm your word Lord we have faith in you to believe your scripture says if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now father we ask We Believe we believe it with all of our hearts many hands have been raised up because of the needs and their body needs in their homes prodal that they want to see come home now father we know there's not much time left to work but Lord we're going to see past this service and see well bodies see our s well Lord let us look through your classes tonight look through the blood of Jesus Christ and see a well body in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen could we stand now amen how many's come to be prayed for this evening amen thank you I want you to believe men of God if you'll come now and amen we do our work now we do our work Amen brother Ron but the service seems to get long in a prayer line let me just share something with you on Thursday morning I I arrived in the cancer center I arrived there at 9:00 is it 9:00 sister Connie 10 10:00 and I sat there 9 to 10: I got shots in my back big old needles and and then I went from that doctor and I set two more hours to see another doctor and then I was with him for about an hour then I sat at another place for about an hour so I'd say collectively I sat there about 4 hours in practicing Physicians they're practicing they're doing the best that they can but if this service would go three four hours and you could be totally healed in a second in a second would it be worth it he's coming by your way thou son of David have mercy on me from that day forward he didn't need a leading dog or lamb or somebody to bring him to where he was at he could see now cuz Jesus passed by his way you have asked for Jesus to come and he's come amen God bless you Brothers if you guys were coming amen amen amen amen thank you thank you amen Lord I believe Lord
