something that's been in my heart for for uh right about 15 years actually to do things like this for the youth and i just appreciate that the lord's made a way and so our vision for the camp of course is that the young people would have the best time that they possibly can have we want you to have a good time have a lot of fun and just do everything that we can to provide that and secondly uh i want you to make a friend i want to make you i want you to make at least one friend this weekend i want you to break out of your comfort zone if you're a little shy find somebody who isn't and have them help you out and i i want you to make connections i want you to meet new people you know a friendship a christian friendship is one of the greatest gifts that god can give a young person the majority of the people that are that are helping to to run this this camp meeting this weekend are people that i went to youth camps with and so they uh and even today we have that strong relationship that goes beyond just friendship beyond common interest it's the connection of the family of god and that will be a that'll be a guiding force in your life if god can give you a friend this weekend

things are possible lord i lord you seen every hand that was raised lord the needs that are on the hearts of your people i ask god that you would touch every heart and every life and give strength and encouragement lord you're still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart i pray that you anoint the word and may it go directly to the heart and move in every situation and we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen as the man of god comes now can we sing the song in moments like these in moments like these i see [Music] i see [Music] can we do that here

hearts and if you don't know me i'm brother andrew spencer and if i don't get to shake your hand by the end of this weekend i want you to leave here knowing that there's one guy that loves you and i'm willing to fight for you here and certainly certainly proud to be standing in this moment with young people that are standing for a message that is that is such as just as powerful today as it ever was and uh we know that we know that god is bringing up a generation that will cast satan down and uh we bring greetings from our pastor brother ron and and the church there full gospel lighthouse and i just would like to send their greetings to each and every one of you as well and i'd like to say how how much of an honor it is for us to be standing here in this moment in time we're very excited to be here it's been about 20 years since i've since i've been in this building and a lot of things have changed in the last 20 years i i was one way when i was here 20 years ago but i'm here a different complete different man this evening and it's all because of this message it's all because this message i owe i owe my entire life to this message and and uh we appreciate true word tabernacle and brother ray and all the efforts uh going into this into this camp and i know they have a great love for the young people and it's been expressed to me from brother nathan and brother ben how much they've been looking forward to this but i wonder if we could just bind our hearts together this this evening and agree that we will expect the supernatural this weekend i believe that if you come expecting that god will meet your needs i believe that if you you so desire this evening i believe that he can show himself to you in a pillar of fire and in the form in the form of a cloud i believe that he's i believe that he's willing to show himself to each and every one of you and i believe with with all of my heart if you come here seeking the baptism of the holy ghost that you'll get it you'll get it and you know if these if these walls could talk i'd say they'd probably look around and say oh no not them people again but oh if we could hear another world this evening speak i've seen that jesus in a people before not again so let's just bind our hearts together as we get ready to go to the word this evening let's just offer up a sacrifice of praise and prayer just now and let's just if it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable lay your hand upon your brother or sister there and let's just unite our faith just for a moment let's call on the god of heaven heavenly father we approach your throne of mercy just now lord one more time lord we we enter into your your house lord this may not be where we normally gather for church but this is a place for this weekend that you have come to do business with your children and i pray father that you see every person here lord right now lord you know their desire you know their needs you know what they have in their life that would maybe be lacking lord i believe that you're as good as your word that you will supply all of our needs and i pray tonight in the name of jesus christ that you would bless your people i pray the mighty angel would come and stand behind this pulpit and set me down over in the corner use this body just for a few moments in time here lord jesus and i pray that you would reach out all the way to the the back of this building may the pillar of fire be seen in this building tonight may the supernatural supernatural god of heaven that has not lost one ounce of his power show forth your majesty in this place lord i pray that you begin to pour out your holy ghost upon these young people lord that that we would set in this place lord that that that men and women come under the auspices of the holy ghost and left here changed father we begin to bless your name and all the children of god say amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of genesis chapter 3 genesis chapter 3 and verse 1. we don't have a minute to waste here this weekend we don't have one minute so why don't you look over at your neighbors and let's have church let's go i'm not i'm very mindful that a lot of you've been traveling today some of you've been traveling throughout the night so i know that you might be just a little bit tired but but i i promise you this that if if if you a man fast i'll preach fast so i'd like to speak to you there all right well let's get started i'd like to preach to you this evening on a thought on not negotiating with satan not negotiating with satan and my theme this evening is satan you lose brother branham said in satan's eddie satan's eden he said i would like he said i wanted to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten you to the promise of god for this age something not something that somebody else was in some other day but something and them things are all right we all refer to those things but i thought that i would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures i got written here that would enlighten you to to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you that's the main thing is to keep the punches off of you as much as you can genesis chapter 3 verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden notice her response and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden guard god had said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to set before you just for a few moments as we make ourselves comfortable in this place set before you two different pictures that were laid at the foundation of the garden of eden as you begin to look with me as we kind of take this journey there you see as we walk into the garden of eden you begin to look and there you're watching two two of god's creation as they're walking down through the garden of the eden and as they're making their way down through the cool of the evening as they're they're walking down through there and there you can watch as as leo the lion is is following them and that of the the tiger begins to follow them and they're as gentle as kittens as they're making their way down through the garden and there begins to be a breeze as it as they're nearing close into the cathedral where they would go in to begin to worship under the palm trees where they would worship worship god and there comes a great big breeze across across the garden there and it begins to stir stir eve's hair just a little bit she didn't she had spent a lot of time with her hair that evening put the curlers and everything just right and she she's got everything just set in order and it was just a little bit too much for her and adam began to speak to that that wind that it would settle down and he would say peace be still and then you can watch as as they're entering into that cathedral that you're that you're watching that all of a sudden this is this is yellow amber light began to come down in the cool of the evening and there god began to worship with them they began to speak to them and said children how was your day here on earth how was your time here today did you enjoy it and i apolo god have come down to the garden this evening to kiss you good night and to lay you down and as adam lays out his arm and and eve lays her head over on adam's arm and she begins to fall to sleep and then god walks over and it begins to lay down each and every one of the animals and the beast of the field everything's in perfection everything's peace everything is calm everything is in order there's no sin there everything is perfect there's no diseases there there's no such thing as mask there there's no such thing as germax there there's no things there that are contrary to the word of god now notice this picture it is set in perfection but let me bring into another picture just for your just for your imagination just for a moment i would like to bring in here is what eve is looking at but this is not what was offered to her this is the picture that is set before her would she receive this picture now as she walks out into the garden everything's dying the wind is so staunch it's so so starts there's no there's no breeze to it death seems to have entered in all the leafs are beginning to fall off the tree where she'd one once had picked berries off of the off of the branches now those berry branches now have thorns and thistles off on them all of a sudden you begin to get this sick feeling running over top of you and and then you're you're watching all of all of all the dramatic things of the day as as sickness rolls on a rampage there's no way that when satan came to eve in the very beginning that he offered her this type of picture he never offered her that there was going to be battles he never offered her that there would be unborn children that would have diseases he never offered her that there would be bloodshed he never offered those things but because she stopped and listened to the wrong thing you see she didn't she did not just disbelieve in god she believed in god she did not just upset the whole program or she didn't just say that she didn't believe in what god had said but she simply listened to one word it was not a full sentence it was not it was not a full paragraph but it was one word and he came in and it looked so close that he began to disbelieve and begin to look over in to another world and because of that satan said to her that i am going to offer you this if you'll just eat of this thing you will be like god you'll see like god you'll have wisdom like god and it looks so close and you and i can never sin against god until we turn down the very word of god and here man in the beginning before the adam or eve could ever ever disbelieve they had to lay aside the very word of god and that's what eve did she simply laid down the very word of god and you see what happened when she began to negotiate with satan and have a conversation that that god is a good god that god's a great god and she began to have this conversation and what notice what happened it got her kicked out of eden you see satan's offer was so close to the truth that it caught the very attention of god's creation now right away you and i would sit here we would say as in the intellectual people and and people of god that we would definitely turn down any negotiations or any debate that satan would throw at us but throw at us but many times we don't realize that it's the devil that is the one that is negotiating with us because he comes in in such a very slick way in a very shrewd way and if you begin to look at that word subtle it means shrewd it means sly and it means sensible and many times when you begin to deal with the enemy and you watch him he comes in a very sensible way and he comes in and he begins to negotiate with you and you say well that seems very sensible and you watch but he comes in and he's and he's so deceitful and how he does business and he he comes in he and he and he shows you he shows you these things but if you can look at that thing and if it doesn't line up with the very word of god you can recognize that it is not god it's not the spirit of god but it is the enemy and he's very wise he he's not like some people paint a picture of him with a pitchfork in his hand and he's got he's got he's got a hook for it for tools and but satan's a real slicker he's full of wisdom he's he's educated and the bible tells us in second corinthians 11 and 14 for of no marvel that satan himself has transformed himself into an angel of light and many times satan when he comes to people he offers them or he appears to them laughable or absurd and people don't fear him and he persuades them to think that his attacks aren't real or it makes people feel like feel like that that he isn't really something or he's just a bad thought or or he's just something that's floating around in the air but satan when he comes to you with negotiation tactics over whether you can broker over this agreement or come to this agreement or not but he does not show you the end result when he comes to negotiate with you when satan comes to you young people he will offer you pleasure he will offer you a good time partying with your friends he he doesn't show you he shows you a good time on the road he shows you a good time party and he shows you having a wonderful time but he doesn't show you the hit on collisions by a drunk driver he shows you you being the best gamer in the world but he doesn't show you having a warp mighty he shows you have and all these actions of being cool and being hip and being being popular in the day but he doesn't show you a broke up home you see he can come in and he may offer you something good and it doesn't seem very very evil but when he begins to offer you something every single time his offer will lead you to destruction and brother branham said that all satan wants you to do is just try one time all he wants you to do is listen to the rock and roll one time all he wants you to do is try one cigarette and then he's got you from right there he ain't trying to tell you that you'll get addicted but he'll try to tell you that you're gonna have a good time but brother branham taught us that if there's ever a question in our mind to not listen to it and to leave the thing alone but satan will offer you a hope and a peace and he'll offer you a good time but let me say this to you young people peace with the devil is a fake peace this ideology of the day where we think that we'll live and let live with the devil when you're recognizing when you look at an enemy that well let's just live and let live with it the only way that satan can exist is if you go down in defeat it's when he requires that you die and he gets exalted on high he wants to come in and offer you some kind of a good time but he doesn't show you what's coming down the road i uh there i heard a story one time about this this hunter that went out into the woods and he was looking for some bear meat and he was he was out there and he was hunting and he he took his rifle out there in the woods and he was he was out there and the first thing he'd come he seen this big black bear coming down through there and he he pulled up his rifle to shoot him and this bear looks at him and says all of a sudden he's seen he's getting ready to shoot and he stands up on his back feet and he says wait a minute the bear starts to speak and says now wait a minute shouldn't we sit down and talk about this saying maybe maybe it's reasonable that we talk about this thing and what are you wanting so so the bear and the hunter begin to sit down and have a conversation and begin to have some negotiations and the bear asked himself what do you want he's well he said i'm looking for a fur coat and the bear says well i i'm i'm looking for i'm looking i'm just i'm just looking for a full stomach and and all of a sudden they sit down there and they begin to have some compromises and some negotiations and after a while the bear left alone he had a full stomach and the hunter had his fur coat the moral of the story don't ever sit down and have a conversation with the bear if you're talking to bears you're on something that i ain't got a hold of but let me tell you the enemy will come and he will try to negotiate with you and try to tell you and give you give you your idea and tell yeah you can live that yeah you can be in the message yeah you can still do those things but i want you to know that you are facing an enemy that isn't just one to make you sick or make you have some kind of complex or make you go down with some kind of ideology or go down with some stigma the enemy that is trying to negotiate with you is wanting to kill you he's wanting to destroy you and destroy your family and destroy or destroy your experience with the holy ghost he's trying everything that he can to try to bombard your mind with all kinds of sin but i got news for the devil you are going to lose we will not negotiate with you we're not up here to have a conference with you we're not up here to lose we're up here to win this thing i am an overcomer and if god's going to have one that goes out of ohio i'm gonna be that one i have been this thing to win this thing i'm not in this thing to back up i'm not in this thing to back off i'm not in this thing to lose i'm in the sink to win this thing and proverbs says that's a man thinking in his heart so is he and if you think you're gonna lose you're gonna lose but if you think yourself that you are a son and a daughter of god that's what you are and as a son and daughter of god you gotta rise to the challenge and set satan down with your offers we will not accept all of his thoughts and his threats that he comes with us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now we know that satan that was the he was the original archangel of god he was the one that once dwelt in heaven he was once he was once there as a co-worker he was he was equal with god and he was once a great person in the heavens and outside of there he was the greatest outside of god he was god's right hand man to fellowship and he he got all puffed up in his heart and he began to exhaust his own ideas and the bible said in isaiah 14 and 12 how are thou fallen from heaven o lucifer's son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did has weakened the nations for thou has said in thy heart that i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars and i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the size of the north and i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high god notice all the eyes there satan is saying that i will do this and in satan's eating and you just bear with me just for a moment but brother branham said in satan's eden he said and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of god's promised word to that age that's how exactly how he's done it at every age he explained it the way in the days of noah he explained it he explained that it was impossible for it to reign from heaven for there was no rain up there and his great scientific gospel that he preached in the garden of eden notice the same one that was preaching back there in the garden of eden was here preaching to those them in the days of noah and he was telling them that he could shoot the instruments to the moon and prove there's no moisture up there but god said that there would come a rain but satan succeeded and poisoned the mind of the people by scientific research it could not be done but it was done god said it would be done and it was done and he did it now satan is always trying to destroy the very plan of god but satan you lose satan you lose he could tell you about how there was no rain on prayer but yet there was a rain up there that satan didn't know nothing about there was something up there that was greater than what he could see and let me say this over you this evening satan don't even see how in the world you're going to make it through laodicea but there is a god that created heaven and earth he is seeing something over top of you that satan himself cannot see i want to declare to you that there is victory hanging over top of you and satan can't see that it's there but god is as good as his word he's going to make sure that it comes to your way and if you come here this evening with an expectation to have victory you will leave here in what's about to victory in this place but satan is about to [Applause] lose your last days he's trying to hold you down with pornography he's trying to hold you down with abuse and suicide when that's the way it's got to be my mom and dad that way my daddy died that way but god is here to say you're not going that way i am what god is looking for in this day to overcome every obstacle hallelujah hallelujah and look at satan in all of his works six thousand years he's been studying you six thousand years he's been watching your dna six thousand years he's been building a case against you you think about how he has attacked the children of god you think about how he has attacked the family of god how he attacked noah how he attacked moses and you think about all this work all of his marvelous success that he had in poisoning the mind of the people and you think about this 6 000 years of work for three and a half year reign he's working all this time knowing that he's going to lose but satan thinks that he's got the upper hand on you let him think that all he wants to i'm here to warn the devil we won't be putting a corner we won't be shut down we're not backing down matter of fact the only way that you and i can lose is if me and you switch sides and you've got a better chance i'm former president trump becoming the pope that you do have me switching sides i'm not switching ties and going over to the losing side i'm on the winning side i'm gonna win i'm gonna overcome i am more than a conqueror who wants to come on my side who wants to come on my side who wants to come over here with your short victory look at your neighbor and testify to him i'm on it i'm on that side i'm going to win this thing i'm going to win this thing you don't know what i had to get go through to get here brother andrew let me say this you're only defeated if you stay there if you stay down you're defeated but if you can get back up if you can get back up god is as good as his word he'll come by your way you don't know what i fought just to be in this building you don't know what i fought just to be here let me say this to you god is on my side god is on your side i have fought the past year and a half with a daddy and a pastor that's been fighting brain cancer you think you've got something to fight the children of god have a short victory this evening i'm not backing off full victory i'm not backing off what i've been promised if you need healing in your body god's as good as his word we're not negotiating with him he said i am the lord thy god that heals all of thy diseases and you are worth my fight you are worth my energy you are worth this meeting god is saying that you are worthy for the healing you're worthy for it it's one thing to tell satan i'm not negotiating with you but too many times people begin to negotiate with god they begin to negotiate well well i i see i see this person out here and i see them act the way they are and they they go to church and they they listen to the message they play tapes but i see they're not living right i say i see i see these things so maybe i can get by with it too what you're doing is you're negotiating with the god of heaven and you're trying to find a loophole to get out of the victory you're trying to find a loophole so that you can get out of wearing and setting in the overcomer seat when you begin to negotiate with god and say well i've seen this one do it i've seen this one come to camps before i seen this one dance i seen this one shout i've seen this one holler but i still see on the backside of their life they're not necessarily living right let me tell you something just because you see a bogus does not mean there's not a reality out there the best way to you know when you're stuttering stuttering studying forgery you don't study i got sorry about that i got my i got my tongue wrapped around my eye tooth and i couldn't see what i'm saying right there but when you go to studying forgery about did it again i'm okay i'll promise i ain't been drinking but when you go to studying forgery that's a hard word for a virginia hillbilly to say forgery but when you go to study forgery you don't study the false you study the real because if you can identify the real you can identify let me use this word bogus that's a whole lot easier for me but if you can identify the real you can really quickly see what's bogus now you might look around here and you say hey i see some people they were dancing in the spirit last week but on monday i seen their facebook just because you've seen something fake let me point to you somebody that's real let me point to you somebody that knows what it's like to live and overcome in life let me point you to somebody that can say i met that supernatural god the reason why satan wants you to negotiate with him and all of his demons he's afraid of a new birth because a new birth gives you more power than he ever had he don't want you dying to yourself he don't want you down to that filthy habit oh hallelujah but we come to this camp to die give me a scripture brother andrew all right paul said i must die daily and if paul had to die daily [Music] now notice notice here brother burnham said he said if if the man by his intellect will finally grieve the holy spirit and keep saying well the holy spirit keeps saying you should and you say well i'm too young what if i belong to church but you should be born again well if i if i get that kind of spit experience i won't be able to do this or that or i can't i can't go to this or or that well you see the devil will tell you that you're going to lose some good time you're going to lose some privileges but he's lying to you he's lying to you especially you young people oh my you don't have to drink you don't have to smoke you don't have to run around in these places of amusement why the holy spirit is a million times better than all the devil could even offer you why you don't even have to drink on strong drink to have a big time sinners do that but you don't have to do that because i been 23 years preaching and i've been drunk the whole 23 years on the holy spirit it's a stimulation itself it never lets up i've always got joy always got peace always feel good the lord is here if i'm sick and body he's got me happy in my soul if things are going good things are going good in my soul and bad in my body or vice versa it makes any difference god is always there and i'm always stimulated with a pleasure that's joy unspeakable and full of glory that's what he does for the believer oh come on somebody i want you to know the major difference between you and satan is satan can't live right and you can it ain't up for debate you must be born again you're not negotiating with god over this you're not negotiating with me you're not debating with me about this you must be born again you remember when brother branham you go and listen to him on standing in the gap you remember brother branham affair you that's familiar with the message you listen to him he tells you i wanted to be a trapper i wanted to go up there and i wanted to go up there in the woods and i i'd come down whenever i got a vision or whenever i got thus saith the lord i just come back down and i'd come back down and i'd give that out you see what brother branham was doing he was he was wrestling with his will and the will of god trying to find a way that he could have both and you remember what happened when brother burnham's there and billy looks over there and said that's your old friend that's old flex down there and and the spirit of the lord began to speak to brother branham he said if you follow your plans you're going to end up that way you see you see god was gracious and you're following a prophet that was true he didn't mind telling you that he battled his own will he didn't mind telling you that he was a man he didn't mind telling you about those things thank god for a true prophet if i can look at a prophet and live a life like that i say hey that's grace for me too how many of you been battling your own will this week can i live this can i do that can i go in or can i go out you've been battling all week you can sit there and cross your arms say man that ain't deep enough for me but you ain't living right and you've been hiding secret sin in your life so you can uncross your arms and go ahead and get right so you don't have to sit there and bombard your pew this ain't a good place to try to hide sin at when the spirit of the lord begins to discern the thoughts of the intents of the heart you better back off you better confess your sin this is about living right this is not about living with two living a two-way life a man that lives a two-way life is unstable in all of his ways you remember when brother branham miller branham's up there and he's starting out in his ministry and those men began to talk to him dr roy davis is real close to him all those other brothers that were so-called theologians of the day here brother branham was a young man having these visions having these visions and and these men were telling them said billy you need to let those things go them things are of the devil and things are of the devil you need to you need to let go of them thing that's psychology that's that's for something out there in the world that's mediums that's you're trying to take you're trying to take mediums places you see what they were doing they were trying to talk him out of the supernatural they were trying to keep him from this ministry you see what he was what the enemy was doing here were men that were so close that were so close to brother branham but yet they were trying to talk him away from a from a ministry that was laying in the bible what if he would have listened to him you and i wouldn't be sitting here this evening you remember when brother branham after after hope had died and he's there in the hospital room and sharon rose is there now that black curtain falls down between him and god wouldn't hear his prayer you remember he's sitting there and the enemy's real close notice when when god is doing business satan is battling satan you lose you lose here he is he's battling it and satan begins to battle him over this and he says now look over there look over there he said he couldn't tell me that he didn't love me but he began to tell me that he didn't care for me say no i want to remind you you lost right here you lost right here he began to tell him now look over here is your daddy just died here's your brother just died your wife just died you just buried her in the house now here here's your little sharon rose she's dying god don't care for you brother branham said it was coming about that time when i was just about to say you're right he said but it come down there to the new birth he said and then he said these words though god slain me yet i'm going to trust satan you lose satan thought that he had the upper hand right here but every single time william branham walked into a prayer line and there was a cross-eyed baby sitting there there was never a cross-eyed baby that walked away from there living in that condition because he was able to put himself there let me tell you church of the living god i know what it's like to stand in your shoes and i'm telling you satan will lose satan lost the battle then and he lost the battle every single time when a young girl come across there when a young boy come across there with those cross-eyed eyes they left there completely whole satan you lose you lose you lose what if it wouldn't have been for that new birth what if it wouldn't have been for that holy ghost what if it would have come down a little further if it had not been for the lord that was on my side then men would have swallowed us up every time you come into a battle you have got to meet him with thus saith the lord just like when jesus was up there on the mount of temptation and he goes up there and satan begins to offer him these things he begins to offer him a compromise he sees him up there he's been 40 days hungry he goes up there and he's trying to make him prove that he's a son of god he goes up there and he's trying to make god clown for him but god ain't got a clown for nobody he didn't have to answer the devil's question he didn't have to answer that but he gets to go up there notice his tactics he goes up there with the same battle that he come against in the garden of eden with the lust of the eye with the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and he said if you be the son of god make these stones in the bread what was he trying to do he was trying to get him to use his power to show that he was a son of god what was he trying to do he was trying to talk him into something to trying to make himself prove that he was the son of god notice here it was just declared in matthew chapter 3 and verse 17 that this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased to dwell notice the battle over position begins directly after he is placed and that's what will happen when you go out on the battlefield as a son of god you watch you have a target on your back and the enemy is hunting you down and he's going to try to throw throw darts at you but you've been given a shield of faith and we're well able to overcome this land there's been a lot of people trying to negotiate with us and tell us this giants over there in that land of the holy ghost there's been a lot of people that try to keep us out of this land what they're trying to do is try to keep you from this born again experience but i want you to know there's a promise that's hanging over you that this holy ghost is for you this baptism of the holy ghost is supernatural god is for you and what they're trying to do is trying to keep you off of the land of the holy ghost i've been battling that thing ever since i ever since i got the holy ghost these men were trying to say that was for days gone by that i miss my day of visitation i'm here to prove to you god still gives a holy ghost i'm only here this weekend to give witness to what the word of the lord can do and the word will always work its way out notice when satan comes to him with his tactics he said it's written it's written he was trying to make him show and negotiate over the circumstances of life he was trying every scheme that he had he was trying every battle tactic that he had what was he trying to do he was trying to give him a kingdom without a sacrifice he was trying him to make trying to make a way so he wouldn't have to suffer he was trying to make a way that he wouldn't have to suffer he was trying to offer a bloodless religion are you with me just for a moment brother ronnie this is my water thank you all right he was trying to talk to him over circumstances all right somebody give lord handclap praise satan you're gonna lose you're gonna lose what was he trying to get jesus to do is trying to talk himself out of who he really was and that's what he's gonna try to do to you is try to make you talk yourself out because you're not going to be able to do these things or he's trying to say well you're not strong enough or you're not big enough but i want you to know that god that's on the inside of you is big enough don't you ever start listening to the devil and don't you ever start talking the devil's language brother branham says it's strange this thing that is so much thought of people they say well i'm i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking the language then you're talking his language then you must never say that don't you never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i am saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all of my heart do you believe in divine healing with all of my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts and everything never permit a negative thought to come into your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it he was trying to get jesus to break the word of god he made moses break it he made eve break it but he met the wrong guy this time and satan lost right there and he had to go back where it came from and we are here to serve notice on the devil today we're not going to stoop down to you we're not going to listen to what you got to say you can try to offer us a religion without an experience you can try to offer us a religion without an atonement you can try to offer us religion as a form of form of godliness but we try to make us deny the power thereof and if you deny the power thereof god hates a powerless religion if you ain't got no blood in your sacrifice you have a powerless religion the devil don't mind you coming to church the devil don't mind you clapping your hands the devil don't mind you saying a prayer but when you begin to pray as a son of god you have power more power than any angel in heaven has more than lucifer himself has one man began to pray by the name of hezekiah he began to pray a prayer of faith and all of a sudden god came down and smote 185 000 assyrians by one prayer by one angel let me say this to you the living god the church of the living god that angel has not left that angel is here to make sure that you carry out the victory that angel is here to make sure that you win satan you lose he don't mind you coming here and clapping your hands he don't mind you even seeing it but when you begin to enter in when you begin to sing and set an atmosphere where the holy ghost says welcome he don't mind you sitting there crossing your arms but when you begin to enter in and say hey he's talking about me i'm the overcomer of that day i'm the one that's going to come out of laodicea i'm the one that's going to come out of laodicea you remember when jesus takes his disciples up there in matthew chapter 16 and he takes them over there in the coast of caesarea philippi and he goes over there and they begin to ask them he said whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said well some say you're alice and some say john the baptist he said but who do you say that i am you see there's power in your testimony you see it's not just for your mama and daddy to say it it's not just for your pastor to say it i believe too many times we get the ideology of a bunch of catholics let's just let the preacher do it let's just let the worship leaders do it this is not about the worship leader this is not about me this is about you whom do you say that i the son of manham and there was one peter that said thou art the christ the son of the living god and he said peter upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it oh come on somebody the strongest part of hell will not be able to stand against it now i want you to notice where jesus takes them to he takes them over into caesarea philippi cisserie philippi is the gate to the underworld it is a place where demon worship is at its strongest and jesus ain't just passing by jews were not walking past caesarea philippi they didn't want nothing to do with it but here jesus takes his closest disciples right into the enemy's camps and he begins to ask them who do you say that i am if you can recognize that i am the son of god and i am building my church upon this revelation i am saying to you that laodicea won't overcome you caesarea philippi won't overcome you the gates of hell will not overcome you but by the revelation of the holy ghost you were overcome you were born to overcome laodicea you were born sampson was born with an anointing upon him to carry off the gates of gaza but there's an anointing over top of you that the gates of hell will not prevail overtop the church of the living god there's a promise hanging over you satan ain't got enough to stop the power of this christ in the church of the living god lays the power to heal all sickness in the church of the living god lays the power to overcome all temptation in the church of the living god what's that power it's the power of the son of man that is making invasion right in down to egypt satan's trying to negotiate with you he's trying to give you a so far religion well you can you can come over here you can claim your message but yet not still have the holy ghost what's he trying to do he's trying to keep you off of your land abraham said it was yours but satan's trying to keep you off of it abraham says that that our our seed is going to sojourn in that land but satan's trying to keep you off of it and pharaoh and moses are having a conversation and pharaoh's trying to negotiate with him trying to tell him now i tell you what you do you just go on out there and you you go out there but you you you leave you you leave all your oxen back here you leave this and he said what he was trying to do was offer him a so far religion but moses moses wouldn't have none of those negotiations he said we're not leaving a hoof behind let me say this to you i'm not negotiating with the devil i'm not leaving one of you behind if you're in the bottom of despair if you're in a pit won't you come up here won't you come up here he said that he would set your foot on a rock to stay why don't you come over here where this revelation is we will not negotiate with the devil we are not leaving one young person behind satan's tried to trap you into it he's trying to make you disbelieve in this message but there is power in this message he's tried to make you doubt the pillar of fire but the pillar of fire is whirling through this building he's tried to make you disbelieve that william branham was the prophet of malachi 4 but this message is true i've seen the power of this message i was a young person just like you and satan tried to offer me a so far religion hey man i knew i knew the quotes i grew up in a message home i grew in a convention speaker's home but that wasn't good enough well you can go in on your daddy's hotel it ain't good enough let me tell you i've been sitting where you're sitting there i know what it's like to live a life where you feel like you got it but when god comes you know that you got it satan makes his offer he's trying to negotiate but i know what it's like i was up there in canada where brother wayne lawson just came back from i was up here with my dad after he'd been in that in that accident about 14 years ago been burned all over his body uh 17 of his body was burned 75 percent of his lungs were burned and brother biscuit had brother biscuit had called my mom in a dis in a moment of despair and told her it said we have bought mount baker camp and and the lord has spoken unto me that ron spencer is going to be the next year's minister you don't know what that did to us as a family we were holding on to a sure word of prophecy but 17 days my daddy laid in a coma 17 days he laid there 36 hours brain dead do you think nate satan wasn't trying to negotiate with us right there but we were holding on to a promise we were holding on to a promise and in 2008 my daddy went up there and he preached that camp it was after the camp i'd seen a lot of supernatural things happen in that meeting but i went up there one young man and i come back a totally different kind of man i was out there on the streets of victoria and i was walking with brother tom ray and i had drawn close to him and something come over top of me while i was walking down a street with thousands of people thousands of people walking down that street and i gave my life to the lord jesus christ in the midst of a bunch of chaos satan could do all he wanted to he so far religion wouldn't work no more and satan lost [Applause] let me i went through the message not too long ago and i i found some titles on what satan is if it's all right i'd like to share some of them things with you these are these are all titles that brother branham gave satan he said satan is against you but god is for you the devil is a tormentor satan is a shadow he's a stir of unbelief satan is defeated satan is conquered satan has a grip satan is a robber satan is rebuked satan is trying to do something evil satan is exposed satan is a deceiver satan is limited satan his power is death when god will let him do it satan is a counterfeit satan is a perverter satan is a tempter satan is unbelief satan is on a rampage satan is a binder satan is not a creator satan is a loser satan is not a healer satan is a

is a buffeter satan is laying for an opportunity satan is subtle satan is the prosecuting attorney satan is the god of this world satan is a liar and satan is the father of lies now this is the last title that brother branham gave throughout all the message and throughout the all the church ages this is the last title that brother branham gave to satan satan is afraid of you oh glory satan is afraid of your power satan is laying waiting trying to trap you into disbelieving this god but the name of jesus christ he's a strong tower we won't negotiate with him our god is on our side our god is our adventure our god is our defender our god is our overcomer our god is our resurrection our god is our holy ghost our god is more than enough our god is a healer our god is a way maker our god is a devil destroying serpent bruising our god is big enough our god is strong enough our god is more than able satan is afraid of you and what you stand for shaking ain't got no legal authority [Applause] you're the church of the most high god [Applause] brother branham taught us that satan wasn't nothing but a bluff and he said now he said you don't have to listen to him but if you do it's on you he's trying to bluff you into this and try to tell you that you're not strong enough he's a bluff let me say it like this satan is a lion but he ain't got no teeth so his bark is worse than his bite he's a bluff and every time he opens his mouth he's a line he's lying to you every single time so why in the world would you listen to him but he's a bluff i want to establish that with you he's a bluff but i hear a prophet saying you're made uh you're made out of that stuff that don't bluff and that come from calvary the devil's a liar the devil's a bluff say it to your neighbor the devil's a bluff i have to say i i'm a business i'm a business man on the side first off i'm a gospel man and then i'm a businessman on the side but i i have i have found that there's a lot of bluffing in business that goes on there's a whole lot of it uh and if they if they think that they can produce a better product or they can produce a better price or they've got a better broker they will try to bluff you into thinking they're the best but when you know the end product price they can't bluff you and i have made a lot of money off a lot of bluffs people trying to act like they're the best in the country or try to do this or they'll offer this price for this and and say well i'm going to give you i can i can make sure that you get such and such dollars for this piece when i know that piece ain't worth it i can call their bluff on it i'll tell you i got i can have you ten thousand here tomorrow morning and i call their bluff on it and there's a lot of people because of their pride they do a lot of stupid things and they swallow those things but here the devil is a bluff and he's trying to tell you that he can offer you offer you this but i'm on the other side of things and i know that he's lying i'm on the other side of things i know what the end product is he's going to try to tell you that you're not gonna make it but i'm on the other side of things where god says you are gonna make it it's a time that you start calling the devil's bluff and said hey i have a sure word of prophecy that was spoken over unto me [Applause] oh he's trying to make you disbelieve this message he's trying to make you disbelieve he's trying to bluff you into thinking it ain't going to work for you what was what was satan doing out there what was satan doing out there when he was trying to make a deal with israel he was trying to make a deal with israel and there was a little boy that heard this proposition he was trying to get him to negotiate and i'll tell you what let's make a deal right here so you i'll come out there and fight i'll come out there and fight but you just said don't send everybody down here you just send me one man you send me one man he was trying to negotiate their terms but there was a young boy that said i'm not going to agree to those terms you can call you can call this israel all you want to you can say what you want to about him but i'm not going to sit here and negotiate with you i'm not going to sit here and let you talk about the church of the living god i'm not going to let here i'm not going to sit here and let you talk about these young people and say they're not worthy i'm not going to let you sit out there and spit out all your tactics and all your bluffs i'm gonna come down there and i'm gonna call your bluff you say that you're good enough today i'm gonna cut your head off today i'm gonna cut your head off and not only that i'm gonna stick it on your sword i'm gonna use your sword to cut your head off and after this there's gonna be so much power that goes to charging through the children of israel that they won't just sit back there but they're gonna follow me and we're gonna chase down all of your brothers you can say that you're going to feed me to the fouls of the air and you can say you're going to do this that or the other you can say all these things you want to but the devil is a lie i'm here to stand up for the church of the living god i'm going to be that david i want you to know that david was so annoyed brother branham said that he didn't even have to pray through he didn't have to cry and ask about am i gonna and am i gonna make it through he knew that he'd been back there when samuel poured the anointing oil upon top of him he knew that he was anointed for the job when nobody else would stand up it was somebody it was somebody said i'm going to stand up for the church of the living god this day i will take your head off of your shoulders negotiate is over satan you lose what did it do it sent a charge through the whole israel and they come back dancing through the streets carrying the head of goliath what's that noise down there in ohio it's the children of god there's a fire that has swept through the building that's charging them said we're more than enough we're more than conquest we are not going to be conquered we're more than conquerors we're not going to be defeated we're the undefeated [Applause] term of me i'm gonna i'm gonna close shortly i see my older brother walk in here a few moments ago that's brother timothy i think that's him he's my elder if y'all didn't know that and i'm so glad they let the younger brother go first first samuel chapter 11. i know you i know you had a long day but i got i got a few more devils to destroy real quick just just just a few more just a few more just a few more what's you let's just go ahead and get them all let's go ahead and have some victory here first samuel 11 verse 1 then nahash the ammonite if you don't know where that's at it's right before second samuel first samuel 11 then nahas the ammonite came up against and encamped against jabez gilead and all the men of jabez said in the nahas make a covenant with us and we will serve thee and nahas the ammonite answered on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it out for reproach upon all of israel and the elders of jabez said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send the messengers unto all the coast of israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee now now before you go on and you can go back and read out through that this whole whole chapter later but here the ammonites had had claimed the right of this uh original possession of gilead for some years and it had been 90 years since they had possession of it and because of jeff death over in the book of judges then when jet theft took it back here 90 years later the ammonites are coming back and they're wanting to renew their claims you see because of a broken covenant here here was the ammonites negotiating with the children of israel over their own property then nahash the ammonite came up and if you go to looking at the name of nahash if you go looking on the backside of his name his name means serpent he is the one and here he is preaching this same gospel and if you'll just surrender to me i i'll take your land man ain't that a stupid devil i'll take your land i'll take your joy if you just let me bore through your eye and and thrust through your right eye of all the men of jabez gilead and here this is crazy to me here the men of jabash gilead give them a week to think about it let me have a week to surrender let me have a week to think about this thing and i'm glad i'm glad that there was somebody that was that was out there in the land and all of a sudden they sent out all these men throughout throughout all the coasts of israel and there they went a weeping and they they went out wailing and crying about these things that here the ammonites are coming in they're wanting us to surrender they're wanting to thrust out the eyes of all of the soldiers of jabez gilead and all the israelites and here here he is he's bringing in his tactics he's bringing in his eyes bringing in what he wants to do he's not only saying i'm going to take your land but i'm going to take the right eye out of every israelite and hear what he was trying to do you see a soldier without his right eye is useless and here this this generation would have been known as the ones that surrendered to the enemy what was he trying to do he was trying to steal their rights what was rightfully theirs trying to get them off of their property trying to say that if you'll just let me come in and steal your rights and there's a whole lot of stealing rights going on in this last day right now they're trying to steal away our rights of manhood and try to steal away the rights of womanhood and try to cross breed different things try to tell you young people it's okay to be this way if you if your car don't say it he's tried to steal away some people get all excited because they're coming after your gun rights they're coming after more than that they're coming after your religion they're coming after your god they're trying to steal everything that is rightfully yours i'm still glad that god's got some anointed people in this day that'll stand up to the devil say we're not going to stand for that we're not going to let our young people live that way i'm glad for men of god that's hey let's have a youth camp where the experience of the holy ghost can get a hold of them glory satan you lose and when saul the newly appointed king had heard this word when he heard them weeping and heard them over their wailing saying what does this mean what's this mean what's always crying about let me ask you what's this crying about you been doing saying you can't live right i'm here to tell you you can live it what's this crying where the enemy's trying to steal your rights let there be somebody that would stand up and say you can still have it saul said what's this mean what's this mean and the bible said that the spirit of the lord came upon saul the spirit of the lord came upon saul and the bible said that saul got angry oh but brother andrew this is the day when we ought to love everybody this is a time when you need to get angry at the devil that's tried to steal your family he sat there and he's tried to abuse your family he's tried to rob you of your real joy as a young lady and trying to tell you're gonna die with that suicide spirit he's tried to rob you from this holy ghost meeting but i'm here to tell you that it's time to get angry at the devil he's trying to poke out the eyes of all of our men and all of our women it's a time that you get angry and say satan we will not have it and because saul got angry all of israel joined themselves together and they destroyed the ammonites it's a time as young people that we join ourselves together and get angry at the one that's trying to destroy my brother and destroy our sister he's trying to tell you and he's trying to rob your shout away from you let me tell you your shout is your miracle is your land it's your land and you're gonna have to fight for it every single inch the children of israel had to fight for it if you want the baptism of the holy ghost you're gonna have to fight for it is a loser brother branham said no brother branham said there was a woman there he'd come to him one time in the prayer line and he said now he said you're awful nervous here little lady he said that's the devil that's making you feel that way you think you think there's many things wrong but nervousness is what the main thing is that's what makes you feel that way feel like that everything's wrong he said like a black boat comes from you like a cloud or something that's a wave of breathing you get scared many times in the evening time when the sun is sinking low you get real weary don't you many times you think you're going to lose your mind but you're not you'll last
