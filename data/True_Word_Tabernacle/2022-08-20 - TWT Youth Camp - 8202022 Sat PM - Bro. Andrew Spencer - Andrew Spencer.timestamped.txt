[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:21] amen
[1:04:23] you know
[1:04:26] a lot of believers
[1:04:27] of this message
[1:04:30] we got to the place where
[1:04:32] we're so revelated
[1:04:34] so advanced in our own minds so
[1:04:36] intellectual
[1:04:37] in our understanding of this message
[1:04:41] you know until we got so far away
[1:04:44] from emotion
[1:04:46] we just can't feel anymore
[1:04:53] but you know in the simplicity of god
[1:04:55] someone captured that in a song many
[1:04:57] years ago
[1:04:59] a lovely little song
[1:05:02] that goes like this i sing because
[1:05:09] that's what it is friends
[1:05:11] you know if some people leave the seat
[1:05:13] of the scornful and
[1:05:15] and join a group of young people like
[1:05:17] this that's what you would discern in
[1:05:18] the hearts of sincere young people
[1:05:21] is a genuine and a
[1:05:23] and a true and an earnest passion for
[1:05:26] the word of god
[1:05:27] something on the inside bubbling a
[1:05:29] response to the word
[1:05:31] amen we sing because we're happy it's
[1:05:34] not a whole lot deeper than that we
[1:05:35] shout because we're happy we dance
[1:05:38] because we're happy we say ma'am
[1:05:41] because we're happy
[1:05:43] we get excited
[1:05:45] we feel something
[1:05:48] many people are afraid of getting a
[1:05:49] little out of order brother branham said
[1:05:51] one time and why it has to be shepherds
[1:05:53] he's talked about that great shepherd
[1:05:54] when he was smitten back there
[1:05:56] he said it was finished
[1:05:59] brother bram said that minute as soon as
[1:06:01] that shepherd was smitten it was over
[1:06:05] sin is settled there was no more sin
[1:06:07] they were clean and the penalty was paid
[1:06:10] and the believers whose names were
[1:06:11] written in the book of life
[1:06:13] predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:06:15] world it was finished the very minute
[1:06:19] that jesus said it was finished
[1:06:21] amen brother ram said no wonder the
[1:06:23] mountains jumped and shouted on that day
[1:06:26] no wonder the sun hit its face and
[1:06:28] screamed for joy no wonder all nature
[1:06:31] broke loose the wind shook the trees
[1:06:33] until they shook and shook and joyed and
[1:06:36] jumped because they seen the prophet
[1:06:38] shepherd on the mountain redeem every
[1:06:41] name on the book of life and they see
[1:06:43] that their own nature was redeemed they
[1:06:45] screamed and jumped and the world went
[1:06:47] into an earthquake and the mountains
[1:06:49] rent and the rocks fell out and the sun
[1:06:52] went down and everything took place
[1:06:55] he said that's like any meeting when the
[1:06:57] shepherd reveals to you that it's
[1:07:00] finished
[1:07:01] he said i've seen jumping spells and joy
[1:07:03] spells but there was nobody hurt
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:06] but the mountains amen nobody hurt and
[1:07:09] he said and i've seen meetings where the
[1:07:11] power of god was revealed to the people
[1:07:13] that they were free from the world and
[1:07:15] the things of the world and the joy of
[1:07:17] the lord filled the congregation they
[1:07:19] stood and screamed and cried and shouted
[1:07:22] to the top of their voice for the glory
[1:07:24] of god i never did see anything
[1:07:26] disorderly i never did see anything
[1:07:29] disorderly i never did see anything
[1:07:32] disorderly
[1:07:34] they were always right in order because
[1:07:37] they had recognized that their name had
[1:07:40] been written on the lamb's book of life
[1:07:42] before the foundation of the world when
[1:07:44] john saw that name written on the lamb's
[1:07:46] book of life the bible says everything
[1:07:48] above the earth everything under the
[1:07:50] earth everything on the face of the
[1:07:52] earth and everything in the sea heard me
[1:07:55] john the bride cry
[1:07:58] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:08:01] be to the lamb of god
[1:08:04] it's in order to worship god
[1:08:08] it's in order
[1:08:10] [Applause]
[1:08:12] hallelujah
[1:08:14] amen we're not here trying to
[1:08:15] manufacture anything but when the
[1:08:17] preaching of the word amen goes forth it
[1:08:20] causes a reaction on the hearts of the
[1:08:22] people why because the light which is
[1:08:24] the manifested word pierce the darkness
[1:08:27] and by revelation amen reveal to you
[1:08:30] that you're one of his
[1:08:32] reveal to you where you came from and
[1:08:33] what you're doing here and where you're
[1:08:35] going
[1:08:36] amen no wonder there be a shout in the
[1:08:38] camp
[1:08:39] hallelujah
[1:08:40] light pierce the darkness if the word
[1:08:42] would bring a shout it would be a word
[1:08:44] shall if the word brings a revival it's
[1:08:46] a word revival
[1:08:48] if the word would bring a baptism
[1:08:50] it'll be a word baptism
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:55] a friend of mine said you might think
[1:08:56] we're a crazy group
[1:08:58] then go join some other crazy group
[1:09:01] we're going to worship the lord
[1:09:02] young people we're here to defend your
[1:09:04] right to worship
[1:09:06] the lord with liberty
[1:09:08] with freedom from the earnest expression
[1:09:11] of the human heart
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:16] brother branson said we're not afraid of
[1:09:17] wildfire
[1:09:19] said don't you think we'd recognize it
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:24] i'd rather have a little wildfire than
[1:09:26] no fire at all but i don't believe it is
[1:09:28] wildfire but i believe it's what brother
[1:09:30] brown said the pillar of fire
[1:09:32] amen as it was on the day of pentecost
[1:09:34] when it divided itself into licks and
[1:09:36] tongues amen and baptized the souls of
[1:09:38] men
[1:09:39] that's what this is this is that
[1:09:43] this is that how many believe the pillar
[1:09:45] of fire
[1:09:46] is here tonight if he's here
[1:09:49] you can touch him
[1:09:51] he could touch you
[1:09:53] he's here friends
[1:09:55] so i think it would be in order to sing
[1:09:57] the song that the angel of the lord
[1:09:58] enjoys
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:01] and whatever you whatever need is laying
[1:10:03] in your life
[1:10:06] now would be a time in the presence of
[1:10:08] god knowing that the angel of the lord
[1:10:09] is here knowing what a great opportunity
[1:10:12] that we're facing
[1:10:14] to have a genuine experience with god
[1:10:17] then i'd lay aside every doubt
[1:10:19] lay aside every weight
[1:10:21] put the past behind you put these
[1:10:23] distractions of this life
[1:10:25] out of your mind and only
[1:10:28] only believe
[1:10:30] let's sing it together as brother andrew

[1:26:16] revelations chapter 10 and verse 1
[1:26:20] and as you're turning there
[1:26:22] brother branham said each one of you
[1:26:24] here is standing
[1:26:26] as believers then the life that was in
[1:26:28] christ is in you it can if you could
[1:26:31] just see it he said it's the devil's
[1:26:33] business to keep you blocked off
[1:26:36] from that
[1:26:38] it's the devil's business to keep you
[1:26:39] blocked off from being a real believer
[1:26:42] but it's god's business to open it up to
[1:26:44] you
[1:26:45] revelations chapter 10 and verse 1 and i
[1:26:47] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:26:49] heaven
[1:26:50] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:26:52] upon his head and his face
[1:26:54] was as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:26:57] pillars of fire verse 7
[1:26:59] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:27:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:27:03] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:27:04] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:27:07] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:27:09] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:27:11] again and said go
[1:27:13] and take the little book which is open
[1:27:16] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:27:18] upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:27:21] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[1:27:24] him give me the little book and he said
[1:27:26] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:27:28] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:27:31] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i
[1:27:33] took the little book out of the angel's
[1:27:34] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[1:27:36] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[1:27:39] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:27:41] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:27:44] again
[1:27:45] before many peoples and nations and
[1:27:48] tongues
[1:27:49] and kings may god bless his word he may
[1:27:51] be seated in the presence of the lord
[1:27:54] as we said we'd like to speak to you on
[1:27:56] when heaven turns loose so why don't you
[1:27:58] turn to your neighbor give them a high
[1:28:00] five elbow them and tell them let's have
[1:28:02] church
[1:28:05] it's all right y'all can do that in the
[1:28:06] back there too when heaven turns loose
[1:28:08] so let's let heaven turn loose in this
[1:28:10] place tonight
[1:28:15] hallelujah
[1:28:16] let's have church
[1:28:18] i think it's an amazing thing that we
[1:28:19] can stand here this evening and we can
[1:28:22] preach to this most powerful young
[1:28:24] people that's ever been upon the face of
[1:28:25] the earth and we can we can preach to
[1:28:27] them from an open book to not not not so
[1:28:30] not saying something or not preaching to
[1:28:32] them something that we're not aware of
[1:28:33] but we've had we've had a prophet that
[1:28:36] would stand here in this in this evil
[1:28:37] day and stood here and preached to us
[1:28:40] the revelation of the seven seals and i
[1:28:42] think it's amazing thing that we can
[1:28:44] stand here and we can preach to these
[1:28:45] young people and recognize real
[1:28:48] realizing and recognizing what has been
[1:28:50] released in this hour is that none other
[1:28:52] than the holy ghost and that's what you
[1:28:54] have been experiencing throughout your
[1:28:56] walk and throughout this week and you
[1:28:58] have been experiencing that of the holy
[1:29:01] ghost and that what you feel in this
[1:29:03] atmosphere this evening has has been
[1:29:05] said and electrified is that of the holy
[1:29:08] ghost and maybe maybe you're new to this
[1:29:10] and maybe you've never been accustomed
[1:29:11] to this don't you be nervous about
[1:29:13] what's going on here tonight it's just
[1:29:15] heaven that is coming down upon its
[1:29:17] children just like earlier in the day
[1:29:19] there was a there was a bad storm that
[1:29:21] came through here and many of you got
[1:29:22] caught out and caught out in the rain
[1:29:24] and it was the rain that would begin to
[1:29:26] fall and there's a lot of people that
[1:29:28] don't like to look at the rain but i
[1:29:30] enjoy the rain i enjoy hearing the rain
[1:29:32] hit on the metal roof and i enjoy
[1:29:34] watching it fall because we recognize
[1:29:36] that it's the rain that brings life it
[1:29:38] brings new life both naturally and both
[1:29:40] spiritually you can't live without it
[1:29:42] and you've got to have it and we
[1:29:43] recognize that there's power in the rain
[1:29:46] and we can look throughout the bible and
[1:29:48] we see a type of noah that that there is
[1:29:50] such power of rain when it had not
[1:29:53] rained had it not rained before but god
[1:29:55] had given noah in his ministry to go out
[1:29:58] there and build an ark and he told him
[1:30:00] that it was going to rain and and you
[1:30:01] watch the power of that rain as it would
[1:30:03] begin to fall for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:30:06] that it covered the whole entire earth
[1:30:08] but you find that when the bible said
[1:30:10] that in genesis 8 that the bible said
[1:30:12] that the windows of heaven were stopped
[1:30:14] and the rain from heaven was restrained
[1:30:17] and you see thy rain stopped in that day
[1:30:19] but i want you to recognize that the
[1:30:21] rain that is falling in this building
[1:30:23] tonight and upon this generation and
[1:30:25] upon this bride it's a rain that will
[1:30:27] not be stopped that what you are
[1:30:29] witnessing is not that now of a teaching
[1:30:32] rain but you are under a harvest rain it
[1:30:34] is what what william branham said would
[1:30:36] bring us rapturing faith he said it's a
[1:30:38] harvest rain or it's a rapturing faith
[1:30:41] and we recognize that that the rain
[1:30:43] falls on the just and the unjust and you
[1:30:45] remember when william branham is up
[1:30:46] there in mishawaka and he saw how the
[1:30:49] spirit of the lord fell on this brother
[1:30:50] and that brother and you know the story
[1:30:52] how that he sat there one was a real
[1:30:54] christian and one was was a man that was
[1:30:56] running around on his wife and those
[1:30:58] things what was it brother branham went
[1:31:00] up there in his cave and he found out
[1:31:02] that it was a rain that was falling on
[1:31:03] the just and the unjust but you
[1:31:06] recognize that the rain was meant for
[1:31:08] the wheat but yet those that were those
[1:31:11] tares that were there it wasn't meant
[1:31:12] for them but yet they were rejoicing
[1:31:14] under that and we recognize that they
[1:31:16] are that we're living in an age where
[1:31:18] we've seen such carnal impersonations
[1:31:21] like never before and you get you get
[1:31:23] caught up young people and you see some
[1:31:24] people that that get excited at youth
[1:31:26] camp they get excited under the
[1:31:28] anointing and man they can run all over
[1:31:30] the building and they can shout all over
[1:31:32] the building and then they can go back
[1:31:34] out and live the way the world does you
[1:31:36] recognize they are under that reign just
[1:31:39] because you see a counterfeit does not
[1:31:41] mean that it's not right or that it's
[1:31:43] not real you recognize that the rain is
[1:31:46] falling and the rain is for you and i'm
[1:31:48] going to say this to you tonight it is
[1:31:50] this holy ghost rain that will fall upon
[1:31:53] you and it'll change your mortal bodies
[1:31:55] it'll change your thought path it'll
[1:31:57] change your channel it'll change your
[1:31:59] ideas it'll change you it's the same
[1:32:02] rain that was falling on abraham and it
[1:32:05] changed his body
[1:32:07] i tell you what you're witnessing is
[1:32:08] that of the holy ghost
[1:32:10] this is the third pull and we recognize
[1:32:14] that i know i know that you're going to
[1:32:15] sit here and you're going to see things
[1:32:17] that go on here that maybe disturb you
[1:32:19] this weekend but i want you to know that
[1:32:21] under this third pool there can be no
[1:32:23] mimics there can be no carnal
[1:32:24] impersonations and you might see people
[1:32:26] that would rise up and work under the
[1:32:28] first or the second pool but there can
[1:32:30] be no mimics the devil doesn't know what
[1:32:32] to do if this third pulled people that's
[1:32:34] why i have the liberty to be able to
[1:32:36] preach to you that heaven has come now
[1:32:39] that the mighty angel is right here
[1:32:41] right now and we recognize that he's
[1:32:43] willing and wanting to get into your
[1:32:45] heart change your life and
[1:32:47] supernaturally charge you with the
[1:32:49] baptism of the holy ghost and i'll tell
[1:32:51] you this if you completely surrender to
[1:32:54] him god will take over your life he
[1:32:56] won't be some put on he won't be some
[1:32:58] makeup it won't be some workup it'll be
[1:33:00] the same power
[1:33:03] it'll be the same power that fell upon
[1:33:05] the day of pentecost this second rain is
[1:33:08] a holy ghost rain and it is a rain that
[1:33:10] produces the crop and i'll say this i
[1:33:13] believe with everything that's within me
[1:33:15] this is the final generation we are
[1:33:18] sitting here tonight and i believe that
[1:33:20] every one of us are sitting here we are
[1:33:22] the final runners
[1:33:25] a final voice and we've got everything
[1:33:28] we have need of to finish the race so
[1:33:30] let us run
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:33] if heaven's come down let's go to him
[1:33:36] and let's run with everything that's
[1:33:38] within us
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:42] i'll tell you what there's an angel that
[1:33:44] is amongst us
[1:33:45] to do the supernatural
[1:33:47] maybe you don't witness him right here
[1:33:49] tonight but i'm telling you that that
[1:33:51] pillar fire that you watched in houston
[1:33:54] is right here tonight maybe you don't
[1:33:56] see him tonight but i'm telling you that
[1:33:58] he's here because we have the word of
[1:34:00] the lord that tells us that he's the
[1:34:01] same yesterday today and forever and you
[1:34:04] might be sitting here and say well i'm
[1:34:06] not getting anything but i'll tell you
[1:34:08] this that god's got angels in place to
[1:34:10] feed his children he's got if he had
[1:34:13] porters up there when elijah had went up
[1:34:15] there and he shut up the heavens and
[1:34:17] those crows came up there and fed him
[1:34:19] when he was up there at the brook of
[1:34:20] teresa and he went up there and they fed
[1:34:23] him the porters were feeding him up
[1:34:25] there when the rest of the world was in
[1:34:26] famine but yet elijah was feasting on
[1:34:29] those sandwiches and brother branham had
[1:34:31] a man challenge him one time he said you
[1:34:33] really don't mean to think that that man
[1:34:35] that elijah was fed by sandwiches he
[1:34:38] said absolutely i believe he was fed by
[1:34:40] those porters they was giving him
[1:34:42] sandwiches he said where did it come
[1:34:44] from he said well i don't know where it
[1:34:46] came from he said but i believe he did
[1:34:47] it he said well
[1:34:49] i don't understand why these people
[1:34:51] shout and i don't understand why they
[1:34:52] get so excited he said it's the manna
[1:34:55] that is falling down upon them and i'm
[1:34:58] telling you that heaven has come down
[1:35:02] you know you know
[1:35:04] you know that which was given
[1:35:05] interpretation of danny henry and those
[1:35:07] things that was there and that thing
[1:35:09] that the thing that was spoken when he
[1:35:12] said that this could be revelations 23
[1:35:14] you remember when he went in there and
[1:35:16] you remember what he said because of
[1:35:18] your momentous decision a huge portion
[1:35:21] awaits a huge portion of heaven awaits
[1:35:23] you now that's not that brother branham
[1:35:25] gets a bigger slot in heaven but i
[1:35:27] believe with everything that's within me
[1:35:30] that heaven had come down and i believe
[1:35:32] what you are witnessing amongst your
[1:35:34] young boys and amongst your young girls
[1:35:37] is heaven coming down i don't have to
[1:35:39] preach to them some low down nonsense
[1:35:42] that they can barely live we can preach
[1:35:45] this full message to this young people
[1:35:47] because heaven has come down heaven's
[1:35:50] opened it up heaven's released itself
[1:35:52] and there's a huge portion of heaven
[1:35:54] that's here
[1:36:01] brother branham said in the key to the
[1:36:03] door he said
[1:36:04] he said i believe in the full gospel
[1:36:06] every word of god
[1:36:07] that turns the power of god loose that
[1:36:10] turns his blessings to the people he
[1:36:12] said it's the key
[1:36:14] to the door that unlocks it
[1:36:16] and to think that tonight
[1:36:18] that the full gospel
[1:36:20] is what is the key to unlock the door
[1:36:23] and to think if you can stand here and
[1:36:25] you can believe this word if you can
[1:36:27] accept this word and it's preached in
[1:36:29] its entirety that it'll lose heaven to
[1:36:31] your situation
[1:36:32] so what i'm trying to tell you is that
[1:36:34] you're not just another association
[1:36:36] you're not just another group you are
[1:36:38] the elect of almighty god god chose you
[1:36:41] before the foundation of the world and
[1:36:43] if god chose you he can't unchoose you
[1:36:46] you see you were the one that had god
[1:36:48] seen before the foundation of the world
[1:36:52] and i'll say this there's not another
[1:36:54] church there's not another creed there's
[1:36:56] not another dogma that can unmatch the
[1:36:59] identity of the bride of jesus christ
[1:37:01] the restoration of gifts of pentecost
[1:37:03] and on azusa street man it looked close
[1:37:06] but yet it wasn't the full wheat
[1:37:10] but there is another people under their
[1:37:13] messenger who is a final voice
[1:37:15] and we're standing here tonight there's
[1:37:17] not one anybody that can match the
[1:37:20] similarity of the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:23] you are the gene seed of almighty god
[1:37:26] and i'll tell you this we're not just
[1:37:28] some donkey or some mule where we're
[1:37:31] some hybrid where we don't know where we
[1:37:32] came from we are we have a pedigree
[1:37:35] we're like a pedigree thoroughbred we
[1:37:37] know where we came from we know who our
[1:37:39] daddy is and we know exactly where we're
[1:37:41] going and when brother branham is
[1:37:43] preaching on the adoption series he said
[1:37:45] there's coming a time when sons of god
[1:37:48] when there will come a time of
[1:37:49] manifestation of sons of god will walk
[1:37:52] out there and take the very power away
[1:37:54] from satan i'm telling you that you are
[1:37:57] that generation that is under the
[1:37:59] obligation of heaven to take satan's
[1:38:02] power away don't you let depression rule
[1:38:05] you you rule it
[1:38:08] this is the believer's domain and it
[1:38:10] reaches from eternity to eternity
[1:38:15] it's time you start rising up as a son
[1:38:18] and daughter of god and taking anxiety
[1:38:20] away from satan taking depression away
[1:38:22] from him taking your troubles away from
[1:38:25] him rise up young boys rise up young
[1:38:28] girls you are under commission
[1:38:33] and god never departs from his
[1:38:35] commission it's time to rise
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:50] i had a young man
[1:38:51] i had a man that was working on my house
[1:38:53] not too long ago
[1:38:55] a carpenter he was working on my house
[1:38:57] and he got telling me a real nice guy
[1:39:00] i believe he's coming to the message
[1:39:01] real soon but anyways he got he got to
[1:39:03] working on my house and he began to tell
[1:39:05] me he does a lot of work for
[1:39:07] for a lot of people with
[1:39:08] some big wigs
[1:39:10] and he got to doing some work for a
[1:39:12] ambassador
[1:39:13] of a country that lived here in america
[1:39:16] lived up there close to washington dc
[1:39:18] just on the outskirts of it and he began
[1:39:20] to tell me he said no he said i go up
[1:39:21] here and i was building this i was
[1:39:23] building this thing for him this project
[1:39:25] for him he said but i found out
[1:39:27] when i went up there he said because
[1:39:28] he's an ambassador he said when i went
[1:39:31] up there even though he lives here in
[1:39:32] america he said i was on his national
[1:39:35] turf because he was under that
[1:39:37] ambassador and he said when i was up
[1:39:39] there i was on his soil
[1:39:43] so let me tell you this
[1:39:44] this is not satan's domain this is
[1:39:47] christ's domain this is your domain and
[1:39:50] you can look at hell right in the face
[1:39:52] and say this is my turf get your filthy
[1:39:55] hands off of god's property you have no
[1:39:58] right
[1:39:59] you have no authority this is my turf i
[1:40:03] am not going down the layout i see it or
[1:40:05] lose heaven come down for me
[1:40:15] brother marion
[1:40:17] brother branham in 1956
[1:40:19] he stood there and he preached a very
[1:40:20] powerful message on the junction of time
[1:40:24] you ain't listen to it i admonish you
[1:40:25] after this meeting to go and listen to
[1:40:27] it
[1:40:28] one of my favorite services
[1:40:30] it'll do your heart much good
[1:40:32] but there brother branham tells us in a
[1:40:34] junction he said angels appear prophets
[1:40:36] arise and signs and wonders appear
[1:40:39] at the end time and at every junction
[1:40:42] and we recognize that counterfeits arise
[1:40:46] at the junction
[1:40:47] and we recognize what a junction is it's
[1:40:49] a blending it's a blending of a roads
[1:40:51] it's a change over in the roads and
[1:40:53] right here we are as a church of the
[1:40:55] living god and we're standing here in
[1:40:57] the blending of time and the blending of
[1:40:59] eternity and we recognize that the
[1:41:02] angels are here signs and wonders are
[1:41:04] here and the omnipotence of almighty god
[1:41:07] is here to prove that he's the same
[1:41:09] yesterday today and forever don't get
[1:41:12] your eyes on the counterfeits
[1:41:16] don't get your eyes on the ones that are
[1:41:18] walking away don't get your eyes on this
[1:41:20] that or the other you keep your eyes
[1:41:22] focused on the angel young people let me
[1:41:25] tell you when you're all alone he's
[1:41:26] still there
[1:41:28] when you sin all you've got to do is
[1:41:29] repent and he'll come back to you the
[1:41:31] dove may fly away when you backsled but
[1:41:34] i want you to know that there is a water
[1:41:36] that is coming from the rock and he's
[1:41:38] still in speaking distance from you he's
[1:41:40] not that far if you'll just go to
[1:41:42] talking to him he'll open up the windows
[1:41:44] of heaven and pour out a blessing on
[1:41:46] your life when you think he's not there
[1:41:48] he's always there when you think he
[1:41:50] isn't looking he's always looking when
[1:41:53] you don't think he's making a way he's
[1:41:54] always making a way when he don't think
[1:41:56] he's working he's always working when
[1:41:58] you don't think he's healing he's always
[1:42:00] healing when he don't see him moving in
[1:42:02] your life he's still moving in your life
[1:42:04] when you don't feel like winning
[1:42:07] that means you are winning because there
[1:42:09] is somebody that's bigger than me that's
[1:42:12] standing at this pulpit and it's
[1:42:14] charging you to recognize that all
[1:42:16] heaven has come down for the church
[1:42:19] of the living god
[1:42:26] he said it always takes the miraculous
[1:42:28] to speak of the omnipotence he said
[1:42:30] omnipotences they're all powerful and it
[1:42:32] takes the miraculous to vindicate the
[1:42:34] omnipotence and only the miraculous can
[1:42:36] do that he said teaching the word is a
[1:42:38] very fine thing he said but faith comes
[1:42:41] by hearing and hearing the word he said
[1:42:44] but it always takes the miraculous to
[1:42:46] vindicate that the omnipotence still
[1:42:48] lives
[1:42:49] and reigns he said we must have the
[1:42:52] miraculous and i believe that the church
[1:42:55] is now standing on a threshold of the
[1:42:57] greatest vindication of omnipotence that
[1:42:59] the world has ever known and there ever
[1:43:02] has been
[1:43:03] and to think that you're right here
[1:43:05] you're right here at the threshold what
[1:43:07] it is is you are that
[1:43:13] how many is a believer tonight how many
[1:43:15] is filled with his spirit
[1:43:18] you are standing here as proof of the
[1:43:20] omnipotence
[1:43:22] you remember when moses was back there
[1:43:24] when he was back there under egypt
[1:43:26] before god ever did one thing he proved
[1:43:29] to them the supernatural and it was a
[1:43:31] supernatural that liberated egypt from
[1:43:33] their bondage you see what god was doing
[1:43:36] is he was working out his word
[1:43:39] i'm going to tell you i'm going to tell
[1:43:40] you what brother random said in the
[1:43:43] junction he said how can a great turmoil
[1:43:45] in this world that we realize that's
[1:43:47] caused that the bible said that spirits
[1:43:49] great spirits has came down evil spirits
[1:43:52] and god unto the people and they've done
[1:43:54] these things and we just see the same
[1:43:56] evil spirits working in our day
[1:43:59] i'm going to tell you
[1:44:01] we've never seen such a release
[1:44:03] of the power of hell like we're
[1:44:05] witnessing right now
[1:44:08] but notice what brother branham says
[1:44:09] right here
[1:44:11] he said but notice again that not only
[1:44:13] that he said when all hell turns loose
[1:44:16] oh heaven turns loose also
[1:44:18] you see what god is doing what he said
[1:44:20] in isaiah 59 that when the enemy comes
[1:44:23] in like a flood that god would raise up
[1:44:25] a standard so what is it it's god
[1:44:28] responding
[1:44:29] so there's evil that's being poured out
[1:44:31] but there's good that's being poured out
[1:44:33] there's supernatural devils that are
[1:44:35] being released that were held back there
[1:44:38] under revelations 9 when william branham
[1:44:40] goes in there in the feast of the
[1:44:42] trumpet and he goes in there and he lays
[1:44:44] out the borders for the supernatural
[1:44:46] believers in this day he goes in there
[1:44:48] like joshua and he lays out the borders
[1:44:50] and said this is yours go in there and
[1:44:52] possess the gate of your enemy footsteps
[1:44:55] means possession and william branham
[1:44:57] lays out the borders
[1:45:00] he lays out the borders but he goes over
[1:45:02] in there in matthew 24 and 24 and he
[1:45:05] tells us that false christs and false
[1:45:07] prophets would arise in the last day
[1:45:09] that if it were possible that it would
[1:45:11] deceive the very elect if it was
[1:45:12] possible
[1:45:14] but it ain't possible god chose you god
[1:45:17] elected you god qualified you and all
[1:45:20] hell can't stop you
[1:45:25] i'm telling you that god will have a
[1:45:27] testimony god's wanting young boys
[1:45:33] that'll rise up
[1:45:34] and tow the line with satan and say i
[1:45:37] will not back off of my god i will not
[1:45:39] back off of these blood-bound promises i
[1:45:42] will not back off of this message
[1:45:46] god had some young men by the name of
[1:45:47] joshua and caleb that was willing when
[1:45:50] everybody else said they wouldn't go
[1:45:52] when everybody else said it was too big
[1:45:54] for them when everybody else said there
[1:45:55] was too many giants out there for them
[1:45:57] there was two young boys that walked
[1:45:59] outside and said we're more than able to
[1:46:02] go in there and conquer that land
[1:46:04] what did brother branham said he said
[1:46:06] caleb and joshua came walking back the
[1:46:08] evidence
[1:46:11] now you might get mad at me mamas and
[1:46:13] daddies and maybe pastors that are
[1:46:14] sitting here that don't have the holy
[1:46:16] ghost but let me preach to you this
[1:46:18] there's going to be some young boys and
[1:46:20] some young girls that walk out of this
[1:46:23] this camp walking back to the evidence
[1:46:26] of the holy ghost and will prove that
[1:46:28] this message is alive and it's working
[1:46:30] right here
[1:46:33] it's time that you start walking back to
[1:46:35] the evidence when god when satan says
[1:46:38] there is no more holy ghost walk back
[1:46:40] the evidence
[1:46:42] joshua was elected to do it and so is
[1:46:44] this church of the living god
[1:46:47] brother branham said in the invisible
[1:46:49] union of the bride he said the
[1:46:50] pentecostal church is in no commit in no
[1:46:53] condition to finish out the great
[1:46:55] commission he said but it'll be an
[1:46:56] elected people that's elected for it so
[1:46:59] you are an elected church of the living
[1:47:01] god to carry out the great commission
[1:47:04] [Applause]
[1:47:06] i'm not looking at a bunch of weak
[1:47:08] christians i'm looking at strong
[1:47:10] christians that same mighty angel
[1:47:14] is anointing you to tear satan's kingdom
[1:47:17] down
[1:47:24] that's a deathstroke to satan when a man
[1:47:27] takes god at his word he said that's the
[1:47:29] hardest hitting that satan can get is
[1:47:31] when a man will take god at his
[1:47:35] i'm word
[1:47:35] to tell you what
[1:47:37] i didn't told you i know how to fight
[1:47:38] but there were some times that i got
[1:47:40] into some fights that was a little bit
[1:47:42] too big for me
[1:47:43] but i had a big brother
[1:47:46] i was never dumb enough to fight him
[1:47:50] i got all the veggies and ice cream and
[1:47:52] he got all the steak and taters
[1:47:56] i ain't gonna tell you everything
[1:47:58] tonight
[1:48:00] but i'm gonna tell you this
[1:48:02] i've never watched a boxing ring like
[1:48:05] we're watching right now
[1:48:08] cause we got some young girls that are
[1:48:10] taking god at his word and they're
[1:48:12] hitting satan with it
[1:48:15] we got some young boys that are throwing
[1:48:17] down depression and throwing down
[1:48:19] anxiety and throwing down suicide and
[1:48:21] throwing down homosexuality and saying
[1:48:24] i'm not going to be a part of that i'm
[1:48:25] going to come out of it and i'm going to
[1:48:27] lay my life down and i'm going to come
[1:48:29] to the cross and i'm going to come over
[1:48:30] here and i'm going to take back what was
[1:48:32] rightfully mine and i'll tell you this
[1:48:35] there's no weapon that is formed against
[1:48:37] the bride of jesus christ that can
[1:48:38] prosper there's going to be a young boy
[1:48:40] that says i'm sick and tired of being
[1:48:43] being held back by change and held back
[1:48:45] my dogmas held back my creeds brother
[1:48:48] branham said that the church had been
[1:48:50] bound that the spirit of god had been
[1:48:52] bound at the doors of dogmas and creeds
[1:48:54] he said but there's coming a liberation
[1:48:56] of it and i'll say this you are under
[1:48:59] the greatest liberty that there's ever
[1:49:01] been
[1:49:03] brother branham said in the third seal
[1:49:05] he said the bride's not received her
[1:49:06] revival yet
[1:49:08] he said it'll take those seven unknown
[1:49:10] thunders to wake her up you are
[1:49:12] witnessing the greatest brides revival
[1:49:15] that there's ever been that's why hell
[1:49:17] is trying to keep you
[1:49:19] he's trying to keep you from this open
[1:49:21] word it's because it will defeat him
[1:49:26] you better back off me devil i know what

[1:50:51] satan's kingdom down

[1:51:23] a prophet announced that i would be here
[1:51:25] so i am here
[1:51:29] i am here fulfilling what william
[1:51:31] branham said that there would be a bride
[1:51:33] in this last day that would be bone of
[1:51:35] his bone life of his life power of his
[1:51:37] power anointing of his anointing it's
[1:51:39] the same body that's being led by the
[1:51:42] headship because heaven has come down
[1:51:47] this body ain't moving without the
[1:51:48] spirit it's her headship
[1:52:02] oh
[1:52:06] oh give up

[1:52:10] that angel's here with this message and

[1:52:29] i'm not worried i'm not worried tonight
[1:52:31] who's going to get it who ain't going to
[1:52:32] get it because god is not the kind of
[1:52:34] male man that drops off the male at the
[1:52:36] wrong house
[1:52:38] what god has for you is for you and if
[1:52:41] you need healing he'll drop off healing
[1:52:43] at your house if you need deliverance
[1:52:45] he'll drop it off at your house god is
[1:52:47] the kind of mailman that he sends a
[1:52:49] messenger by the way and makes sure that
[1:52:51] the message gets to its spot
[1:52:56] i say that that same angel is whirling
[1:52:59] through this building
[1:53:00] [Applause]
[1:53:08] you watch those
[1:53:09] 120 up there on the day of pentecost
[1:53:13] they got up there with one mind
[1:53:15] they got up there with one goal
[1:53:18] they were united on the same fact and
[1:53:20] upon the same basis that god was going
[1:53:22] to release upon them what was spoken
[1:53:25] over in the book of john
[1:53:26] then he breathed on them the holy ghost
[1:53:28] and they went up there and they received
[1:53:30] that promise on the day of pentecost
[1:53:32] when peter come out there and he
[1:53:34] preached to them the inauguration
[1:53:36] message he preached to them that you
[1:53:39] shall repent and be baptized in the name
[1:53:42] of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:53:43] remissions of your sins and you shall
[1:53:46] receive the gift of the holy ghost and
[1:53:48] if you have not been baptized in his
[1:53:50] name then you have never been baptized
[1:53:53] the most precious name and it's the most
[1:53:55] holy name but witness what they were
[1:53:57] doing up there they were under one union
[1:54:01] and i wonder what would happen in this
[1:54:02] place tonight if we'd get in here in the
[1:54:04] same mind in the same accord into the
[1:54:06] same union
[1:54:08] now i know it hurt your feelings back
[1:54:10] there but it's time that you come up
[1:54:11] here and unionize with me just for a
[1:54:12] minute not what i'm i ain't trying to
[1:54:15] get you to unionize to me but i'm trying
[1:54:17] to get you to unionize with the bride
[1:54:18] with the word of jesus christ brother
[1:54:21] branham said in a union he said a union
[1:54:23] creates a worship he said a union he
[1:54:25] said you have to beg people to worship
[1:54:27] you don't have to beg people to give you
[1:54:29] don't have to beg people to say amen
[1:54:31] because they're in a union and when you
[1:54:33] come in a union it breaks every power
[1:54:35] that satan's got it holds back the very
[1:54:38] power of hell when you come here
[1:54:42] i wonder if everybody here under the
[1:54:45] sound of my voice just for a moment in
[1:54:47] time forget about who you are forget
[1:54:49] about what your last name is forget
[1:54:51] about what church you came from and we
[1:54:53] gather under the same goal to see empty
[1:54:56] vessels filled and watch them shake the
[1:54:59] world with it
[1:55:00] i say let god feel them let god do the
[1:55:03] work
[1:55:04] [Applause]
[1:55:13] when william branham goes
[1:55:15] in the unveiling of god and i'm just
[1:55:16] going to lay some things down before we
[1:55:18] go further
[1:55:19] when william branham comes there and he
[1:55:21] preaches on the unveiling of god
[1:55:23] he goes in there and he grabs prophecy
[1:55:25] he goes in there and grabs joel chapter
[1:55:27] 2 and he goes into hebrews and he goes
[1:55:29] in there and he breaks into the greek
[1:55:31] here's a hillbilly kentuckian breaking
[1:55:33] into the greek and he goes in there and
[1:55:35] he starts breaking into god in morphine
[1:55:38] that god was just he said he's same in
[1:55:40] his nature he's same in his nature and
[1:55:42] he cannot change he said but he can't
[1:55:45] change his form he said he can't change
[1:55:47] his he can't change his nature he's
[1:55:49] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:55:50] and forever he said he simply that same
[1:55:53] god that was back there in the beginning
[1:55:55] that was rolling worlds off of his
[1:55:56] fingertips was the same one that met
[1:55:58] moses up there on that mountain up there
[1:56:01] it was him in that pillar fire it was
[1:56:04] god just simply changing his mask
[1:56:07] and what brother branham does when he
[1:56:08] goes in the unveiling of god he goes in
[1:56:11] there and he breaks into joel chapter 2
[1:56:13] he said and it shall come to pass that
[1:56:15] afterwards that i will pour out my
[1:56:18] spirit
[1:56:19] now notice what he's doing he said now
[1:56:21] we look at that in the english word he
[1:56:24] said we'd look at it and he said it
[1:56:25] means vomit up he said but you've got to
[1:56:27] look at it in the original greek he said
[1:56:29] it's not like it is in the english here
[1:56:31] he said to give something that's not of
[1:56:33] itself he said but he himself poured
[1:56:36] himself into the church so it's christ
[1:56:40] in you the hope of glory
[1:56:43] so what you're witnessing is that which
[1:56:45] was spoken by joel chapter 2 that this
[1:56:48] is that that was spoken
[1:56:51] that it's the same lord jesus it's the
[1:56:53] same pillar of fire it's the same
[1:56:55] anointing it's the same mighty hating
[1:56:57] joy it's jesus christ
[1:57:00] he's not going to leave you he's pouring
[1:57:03] himself out he's emptying himself out
[1:57:06] into the final runners
[1:57:08] and our lives are here
[1:57:11] to meet the challenge of the day
[1:57:17] i'm quoting to you your prophet he goes
[1:57:19] in there and he says you watch a man
[1:57:21] with his gifts and you watch him how
[1:57:23] he's built he's built in such a way to
[1:57:25] meet the challenge of that day he said
[1:57:27] and so now you are made creatures a son
[1:57:30] and daughter of god manifested son and
[1:57:32] daughter of god to meet the challenge of
[1:57:34] this hour to vindicate that the true and
[1:57:37] living god of this hour that the message
[1:57:39] coming forth in its time and to think
[1:57:42] that we're right here under the greatest
[1:57:44] message that's ever been released
[1:57:46] that's why i can preach to you that
[1:57:48] heaven has come down and heaven has
[1:57:50] released itself this is christ that has
[1:57:53] descended upon the church of the living
[1:57:56] god we are matching the promise of the
[1:57:59] archangel
[1:58:05] when paul goes there in first
[1:58:06] thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 16 he
[1:58:08] said the lord himself shall ascend from
[1:58:10] heaven
[1:58:11] with a shout and with the voice of the
[1:58:12] archangel and with the trump of god and
[1:58:14] the dead and christ shall rise first and
[1:58:16] when brother branham preaches the
[1:58:17] rapture he goes in there and he said he
[1:58:19] does all three things as he's descending
[1:58:22] the shout is a message the voice is what
[1:58:24] wakes the sleeping by but it's the
[1:58:26] trumpet that is the catching away it's
[1:58:29] the ascension that is calling a body
[1:58:32] it's calling a body so what you're under
[1:58:35] is christ that has descended upon the
[1:58:37] church of the living god but it's the
[1:58:38] message
[1:58:40] that is causing ascension
[1:58:42] you can't separate me from this message
[1:58:45] now you know william branham said you
[1:58:46] can't separate the message from the
[1:58:48] messenger but i'm going to go a little
[1:58:49] bit further you can't separate me from
[1:58:51] this message i am the message i am the
[1:58:54] fulfillment of revelations 10 8 i am the
[1:58:57] revelations of 10 11. i am i am the

[1:59:24] and don't you get mad when god drops off
[1:59:27] the mail at your neighbor's house what
[1:59:29] god meant for your neighbors for your
[1:59:31] neighbor why don't you just thank god
[1:59:32] that he knew where to deliver that

[2:00:00] of that bride that was marching on step
[2:00:02] onward christian soldiers
[2:00:05] god's looking for a dancing partner a
[2:00:08] dancing partner i wonder if there's
[2:00:10] anybody that would like to dance with
[2:00:12] king jesus
[2:00:26] now you know
[2:00:27] you know you're getting in rhythm with
[2:00:29] music
[2:00:30] because you're watching the conductor
[2:00:32] and you're watching the director and
[2:00:34] everything's in step and everything's in
[2:00:36] order and you're watching this one take
[2:00:38] their place and you're watching that one
[2:00:40] take the place don't get mad
[2:00:43] everybody's got their part
[2:00:47] and he said if the conductor says that
[2:00:50] the days of miracles are not passed then
[2:00:53] the choir has got to say
[2:00:59] now i know you
[2:01:00] i know you don't listen to that message
[2:01:01] shalom and you've heard it enough
[2:01:04] if he says that the days of miracles are
[2:01:06] not passed then the choir says
[2:01:12] it's time that we start let's stop
[2:01:14] listening to the devil and we start
[2:01:16] listening to the one that preached this
[2:01:17] message
[2:01:18] he said i'll say the words you just
[2:01:20] repeat them why don't you start saying
[2:01:23] what william branham said on the tape
[2:01:25] and stop taking away from it you'll
[2:01:27] watch liberty come amongst these young
[2:01:29] people when you take away from it and
[2:01:31] when you add to it you are taken away
[2:01:32] from the authority of the word and when
[2:01:35] you can stand there and preach it in its
[2:01:36] entirety
[2:01:38] you're going to watch some young people
[2:01:40] that rise to the challenge and beat down
[2:01:42] the devil
[2:01:44] i'm sick and tired of the devil beating
[2:01:46] around our young girls and telling them
[2:01:48] that they've got to crown themselves
[2:01:50] with depression and with anxiety
[2:01:54] it's time that you take your position
[2:01:56] say heaven's come down to me and i've
[2:01:58] come to take over
[2:02:09] ain't no other age has been promised
[2:02:11] this
[2:02:12] like in this age of malachi 4 and luke
[2:02:14] 17 30.
[2:02:16] john 14 and 12 joel 2 38
[2:02:19] this message was to bring you into
[2:02:20] fellowship with none other than jesus
[2:02:22] christ not to educate you but to contact
[2:02:25] the living god that's why he's moving
[2:02:27] with one purpose is to get into his
[2:02:30] believing children that's why he's
[2:02:31] appearing to us
[2:02:40] he appeared
[2:02:42] to abraham
[2:02:43] he talked to him along
[2:02:45] all of his journey
[2:02:48] you had some rough roads
[2:02:51] you had to separate from friends
[2:02:53] because of this message
[2:02:59] he had to walk away from family because
[2:03:01] of this message
[2:03:03] but abraham
[2:03:04] there's something coming for you
[2:03:07] abraham get ready
[2:03:11] you got to separate from your mother you
[2:03:13] got to separate from your father you're
[2:03:15] going to walk in a strange land
[2:03:17] but where god's leading you he'll never
[2:03:19] lead you into a mistake
[2:03:21] he'll never lead you down trouble
[2:03:23] he'll never lead you down a road that
[2:03:24] his grace isn't strong enough to get you
[2:03:26] out of the mess that you got yourself in
[2:03:30] abraham he's got you
[2:03:33] abraham he knows where you're going to
[2:03:35] live at
[2:03:36] he's already got a spot picked out
[2:03:38] and you're walking and you're searching
[2:03:41] for a building
[2:03:47] who's builder and maker is god
[2:03:52] and he's watched over your life
[2:03:54] it's the same one that's been speaking
[2:03:56] you all the way from genesis chapter 12.
[2:03:59] it'll be the same one that takes you all
[2:04:00] the way to genesis 22.
[2:04:03] you're gonna have to go through some
[2:04:05] stuff abraham
[2:04:06] but this elohim is gonna be with you
[2:04:10] he ain't gonna leave you
[2:04:11] because there's something in store for
[2:04:13] you abraham
[2:04:16] there's gonna come a time when you go
[2:04:18] all the way through justification
[2:04:19] abraham and you go all the way through
[2:04:21] sanctification abraham and then you're
[2:04:23] going to go all the way in genesis 18
[2:04:26] and you're going to get the baptism of
[2:04:27] the holy ghost abraham abraham just keep
[2:04:30] walking with jesus
[2:04:34] just keep on walking
[2:04:35] god had god has a witness at all times
[2:04:38] when nimrod was up there and he was
[2:04:40] building his babylon god had a witness
[2:04:42] there was one enoch that was walking
[2:04:44] with god and he had this testimony that
[2:04:46] he pleased god he walked so much with
[2:04:49] that hell
[2:04:51] that he could not leave him here i
[2:04:53] happen to believe that there's a church
[2:04:56] there's a group that has walked so close
[2:04:59] with this elohim that you have lived a
[2:05:01] testimony that you've lived a life that
[2:05:04] you cannot leave you here
[2:05:07] abraham keep walking
[2:05:09] keep walking
[2:05:11] keep walking
[2:05:16] abram
[2:05:17] i'm no longer going to call you abram
[2:05:20] but i'm gonna call you abraham
[2:05:22] because you cannot do this on your own
[2:05:25] you know you can't do it on your own you
[2:05:27] know you can't walk up there in genesis
[2:05:29] 22 with isaac and you know you can't
[2:05:31] come down without me
[2:05:36] you know you need me
[2:05:38] you know you can't live without me you
[2:05:40] know you'll never make it without me but
[2:05:42] i promise you that i'll never leave you
[2:05:44] and i'll never forsake you
[2:05:46] abraham i've got to change your name
[2:05:48] because i've got to put a part of myself
[2:05:50] in there and when he put the h in there
[2:05:52] he put the very breath of god on the
[2:05:54] inside of abraham he had so much god on
[2:05:57] the inside of him that he could produce
[2:06:00] an isaac
[2:06:01] [Applause]
[2:06:04] oh
[2:06:08] brother andrew i'm never gonna make
[2:06:11] i'm never gonna make it i'm never gonna
[2:06:13] get through i'm never going to be good
[2:06:15] enough i'm not going to do it let me
[2:06:17] tell you when god puts himself on the
[2:06:18] inside of you you going to make it
[2:06:21] you're going to produce
[2:06:25] that's why william branham stood here he
[2:06:27] said i'll no longer call you church but
[2:06:29] i'll call your bride so that you
[2:06:30] understand it
[2:06:32] you couldn't do it on your own but when
[2:06:34] god put himself when god poured himself
[2:06:38] on the inside of you it made you strong
[2:06:41] enough abraham
[2:06:42] [Applause]
[2:06:46] people have made fun of you all your
[2:06:48] life
[2:06:52] made fun of you because you've been
[2:06:53] listening to a voice
[2:06:56] that's led you down some roads that
[2:06:58] looked
[2:06:59] inconceivable to the rest of the world
[2:07:02] how is this going to produce
[2:07:04] how is this voice going to produce
[2:07:07] what abraham's name really means a
[2:07:09] father of nations how is it going to
[2:07:11] produce it
[2:07:14] everybody's mocked you because you've
[2:07:16] said here under the revealing of the
[2:07:17] word and they're out there having their
[2:07:19] fun and they're out there enjoying their
[2:07:20] time but you're fellowshipping with
[2:07:22] elohim
[2:07:28] and brother brandon said you watch
[2:07:31] the effect of the revelation
[2:07:33] that it had on abraham
[2:07:36] now he's here
[2:07:38] he's right here right now
[2:07:41] you watch the effect of the revelation
[2:07:43] that it had on abraham
[2:07:45] that when he was sitting there with his
[2:07:47] back turned to the tent
[2:07:49] and god came down
[2:07:51] in human bodies and he said gabriel you
[2:07:54] take this one and michael you tap into
[2:07:56] this one and here i step in and god blew
[2:07:59] himself a body and he stepped into it
[2:08:03] and when abraham watched the effect of
[2:08:04] the revelation
[2:08:06] he said my lord
[2:08:10] you watch the effect of the revelation
[2:08:12] that it's had on these young people they
[2:08:14] don't see three gods
[2:08:15] they don't see jesus as a weaker god or
[2:08:17] the lesser god
[2:08:18] they see him who he is
[2:08:21] don't you be afraid of pastors to preach
[2:08:23] to them this message they recognize who
[2:08:25] this is they're sensitive if our little
[2:08:27] girls are sensitive to the moving of the
[2:08:30] spirit you can preach to them this
[2:08:31] message
[2:08:34] don't you be ashamed to preach to them
[2:08:36] don't you be ashamed to preach to them
[2:08:38] the gifts of the spirit god's wanting a
[2:08:40] body that's in full operation
[2:08:42] god's wanting a body that he can move in
[2:08:44] god's will in the body that he can work
[2:08:46] in
[2:08:48] heaven is here
[2:08:50] let him in
[2:08:52] elohim judge the door let him in
[2:08:55] don't mock him don't laugh at him
[2:09:02] now abraham i'm going to take you just a
[2:09:04] little bit further
[2:09:05] abraham
[2:09:07] what you have created
[2:09:09] has came from you
[2:09:17] this melchizedek
[2:09:19] loosed abraham to produced in isaac
[2:09:25] and this melchizedek has a loose this
[2:09:28] bride
[2:09:32] he's loose this bride
[2:09:34] abraham you can't do it on your own
[2:09:36] you can walk up there on that mountain
[2:09:38] you can walk up there on mount moriah
[2:09:39] you can walk up there and watch with the
[2:09:42] spirit of the prophecy that was upon
[2:09:44] abraham when he walks up there with his
[2:09:46] two servants he said i and the lad will
[2:09:49] come down again it was a spirit of
[2:09:51] prophecy that was on abraham that he
[2:09:53] walked up there and isaac knew how to
[2:09:55] worship isaac knew how the sacrifice was
[2:09:58] to be he said here's
[2:10:00] he said here's the wood he said here's
[2:10:02] the fire he said but where's the
[2:10:03] sacrifice but watch the spirit of
[2:10:05] prophecy that came on abraham my son god
[2:10:08] will provide for himself a sacrifice now
[2:10:12] abraham i want to tell you what god has
[2:10:14] for you is for you and what you've
[2:10:17] created
[2:10:19] satan can never take away
[2:10:21] satan has never been able to produce a
[2:10:23] creation he's never been anything but a
[2:10:26] perverter
[2:10:27] what you've created has come from you
[2:10:29] and i want you to sit there and have
[2:10:31] yourself a testimony service abraham i
[2:10:34] created an isaac i created an atmosphere
[2:10:37] i created a worship i created a praise i
[2:10:40] created a dance i created a hallelujah i
[2:10:43] created an amen
[2:10:47] and if you've created one cell of
[2:10:49] worship you've done more than satan ever
[2:10:52] can he has never been able to create one
[2:10:55] thing abraham it's your creation
[2:11:04] abraham

[2:11:12] in you

[2:11:17] it'll be the same supernatural god
[2:11:21] that'll take this bride
[2:11:23] we'll take these young girls
[2:11:26] and we'll change their bodies in a
[2:11:28] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[2:11:35] don't you be ashamed about what's about
[2:11:37] what's to happen right here
[2:11:41] god is not ashamed what he put on the
[2:11:42] inside of you abraham
[2:11:45] it's time that you start producing what
[2:11:47] he put on the inside of you
[2:11:49] what he gave
[2:11:50] to you was for you to produce
[2:11:54] it's time that you start letting up open
[2:11:57] up and up your mouth and you start doing

[2:12:37] drugs but god is going to have an
[2:12:39] overcomer god is going to have a weapon

[2:19:00] william branham
[2:19:01] said in the seventh seal and i'm closing
[2:19:07] he said when you see the supernatural
[2:19:08] come down
[2:19:10] it's the mind of christ
[2:19:17] i think i'm right on target
[2:19:22] what you're witnessing
[2:19:24] is the mind of christ
[2:19:27] you're watching a generation
[2:19:30] defy the odds
[2:19:33] every generations is 10 times worse
[2:19:35] and there is a young people right here
[2:19:40] with the supernatural in their mouth
[2:19:44] heaven's turning loose
[2:19:46] john 14 12. ask and it shall be given
[2:19:48] unto you if you ask anything in my name
[2:19:51] i will do it john 15 and 7 if you abide
[2:19:54] in me and my words abide and you ask
[2:19:56] what you will i'm looking at a people of
[2:19:58] philippians 4 and 13 that i can do all
[2:20:01] things through christ jesus who
[2:20:03] strengthens me
[2:20:04] this is the generation
[2:20:06] [Applause]
[2:20:13] now i don't know where you're at
[2:20:17] and i don't know where you at
[2:20:18] spiritually
[2:20:19] but i guarantee you tonight
[2:20:23] that the spirit of prophecy is here
[2:20:27] and i'm gonna prophesy over this
[2:20:28] generation
[2:20:31] over these young people
[2:20:34] just like moses prophesied over top of
[2:20:36] those israelites you will not go out of
[2:20:38] here empty
[2:20:45] tonight it's going to be different
[2:20:48] tonight there's a change coming
[2:20:53] don't get scared on me
[2:20:55] the spirit of prophecy is a testimony of
[2:20:57] jesus christ
[2:21:02] my dad told a story for years you
[2:21:04] probably sat here and heard it
[2:21:07] but he was on a plane one time
[2:21:10] he was on a plane one time brother wayne
[2:21:11] and he was sitting there and he was
[2:21:12] coming down and you know how as you're
[2:21:14] coming down to the close
[2:21:16] of the flight that's where everybody
[2:21:17] wants to talk to you they don't want to
[2:21:18] talk to you the whole entire time
[2:21:21] until it's calm close
[2:21:23] till you're getting ready to get off and
[2:21:24] everybody wanted to talk to you then
[2:21:27] it's smart to do that sometimes you
[2:21:29] never know what kind of nut you're going
[2:21:30] to be setting aside
[2:21:33] there's power and silence there's
[2:21:35] somebody knows what i'm talking about
[2:21:42] but he was sitting in between two
[2:21:44] insurance agents
[2:21:48] and i asked him said no
[2:21:50] what do you do he said well i'm a
[2:21:52] preacher i'm a preacher
[2:21:55] he said what do you preach
[2:22:03] well they was pulling it out of me
[2:22:06] hey so i preached the teachings of
[2:22:07] william branham
[2:22:08] i'm wayne now one insurance agent
[2:22:11] so i know about william branham
[2:22:14] i know about these stories you probably
[2:22:15] heard him tell this
[2:22:17] talk to him along
[2:22:18] along the way until they got off and
[2:22:20] brother ron never seen that man again he
[2:22:22] said i always wondered
[2:22:24] i always wondered what happened to that
[2:22:26] guy or where he was at he'd tell that
[2:22:28] story of meetings thinking well maybe
[2:22:29] one day i'll run into him again
[2:22:32] we did we do
[2:22:34] we do some things just out of the
[2:22:36] ordinary sometimes we don't always after
[2:22:38] we get done preaching we we don't feel
[2:22:39] like fellowship and there's there's
[2:22:42] you forgive us for that
[2:22:44] but we're pretty much tuckered out by
[2:22:46] the time we get done
[2:22:48] but we did something kind of out of the
[2:22:50] ordinary last weekend
[2:22:53] we have a family
[2:22:54] we have a family that we hadn't had to
[2:22:56] have a whole lot of fellowship with but
[2:22:58] we decided we want to take some time and
[2:23:00] right after brother ron preached and you
[2:23:02] all know that
[2:23:03] me and brother matthew are doing a very
[2:23:04] good job
[2:23:06] keeping him protected
[2:23:08] and you i appreciate you bearing with me
[2:23:10] on that
[2:23:11] brother ron said he said let's let's
[2:23:13] let's have some dinner here
[2:23:14] we go down and
[2:23:16] there was a family member that came up
[2:23:18] to meet this family
[2:23:20] be with them for the weekend
[2:23:24] he was an insurance agent
[2:23:28] mother on sitting down there beside him
[2:23:30] all of a sudden the spirit of the lord
[2:23:31] says that's the man
[2:23:37] god knows where you're at
[2:23:39] ain't that right sister alyssa
[2:23:42] god knows where you're at
[2:23:45] when you think what's that mean
[2:23:47] god knows where you're at tonight
[2:23:51] god knows where you're sitting at
[2:23:53] and he knows what you have need of
[2:23:57] last year we witnessed some very
[2:23:59] supernatural things right here
[2:24:02] right here last weekend supernatural to
[2:24:05] say the least
[2:24:06] lives were changed
[2:24:08] hearts were changed young girls young
[2:24:10] boys went back to their churches filled
[2:24:12] with the holy spirit there was such a
[2:24:14] powerful anointing here
[2:24:16] much like this tonight
[2:24:20] you remember they
[2:24:22] they carried me off back there
[2:24:26] and there were some people that bumped
[2:24:28] into an angel
[2:24:32] that same angel is here
[2:24:40] but i got a real friend here
[2:24:43] and ronnie long
[2:24:52] life's been pretty
[2:24:53] tough sometimes i'm brother ronnie
[2:24:57] but ronnie long's an overcomer
[2:25:00] he's a real testimony of this message
[2:25:06] his brother ronnie was taking care of me
[2:25:08] and taking me back to my
[2:25:10] camper last year
[2:25:12] i told brother ronnie i said mother
[2:25:14] honey i'm going to give you this
[2:25:16] handkerchief
[2:25:19] i'm going to give you this handkerchief
[2:25:21] inside of it is a prayer cloth that
[2:25:23] william branham prayed over
[2:25:25] it's for you
[2:25:27] it meant a lot to brother ronnie because
[2:25:29] there were some details there
[2:25:31] that i won't share right now
[2:25:33] that the lord knew
[2:25:37] you know god cares where you are
[2:25:42] is it okay if i prove to you that god
[2:25:43] knows where you're at
[2:25:50] we had a real tragic accident happen to
[2:25:52] the bride of jesus christ
[2:25:56] we lost
[2:25:58] a young boy and a young girl
[2:26:00] mother charlie and sister rachel
[2:26:03] brother ronnie and sister felice had
[2:26:04] some belongings there
[2:26:06] at their house when that explosion took
[2:26:08] place ain't that right
[2:26:13] and he asked sister felice
[2:26:17] they lost about 75-80 percent of their
[2:26:19] belongings in that
[2:26:22] he asked sister felicid
[2:26:24] was that handkerchief
[2:26:26] was that handkerchief in there
[2:26:30] in the explosion
[2:26:31] he said yeah i put it in there with the
[2:26:33] rest of your handkerchiefs down in a
[2:26:34] little box
[2:26:37] hunted for it it meant something to him
[2:26:39] but god knows where you're at
[2:26:42] just last month brother ronnie
[2:26:44] brother nathan were coming back from
[2:26:46] australia
[2:26:50] and they were they were really tired
[2:26:52] from the meeting
[2:26:53] they'd walked away
[2:26:56] brother ronnie come back to a seat where
[2:26:57] he had been sitting at and he looked
[2:26:59] underneath that chair
[2:27:03] he said
[2:27:04] nathan
[2:27:06] is that yours
[2:27:09] and folded up
[2:27:10] underneath that chair that should have
[2:27:12] been an explosion
[2:27:13] was this handkerchief
[2:27:22] god knows
[2:27:24] how to take care of you
[2:27:27] the supernatural is here
[2:27:31] if god can provide
[2:27:33] a ram and a thicket
[2:27:35] if god can provide squirrels if god can
[2:27:38] provide a handkerchief surely he can
[2:27:40] produce a change in your life
[2:27:45] the supernatural
[2:27:47] is here
[2:27:50] now tonight as the musicians come
[2:27:53] and the song leader makes his way
[2:27:57] tonight we feel
[2:27:58] to have a prayer line here

[2:28:36] and if you have a real need
[2:28:38] i'd like for you to come through this
[2:28:40] prayer line if you feel to do so
[2:28:42] but i'm going to ask you to do something
[2:28:44] for me

[2:28:53] if you've got any unconfessed sins in
[2:28:55] your life

[2:29:13] and she just stepped out for a minute
[2:29:16] she said god
[2:29:18] would you forgive me
[2:29:22] and she stepped back in the line
[2:29:24] and all was forgiven
[2:29:29] you do your part
[2:29:31] and god will do his
[2:29:34] nehemiah
