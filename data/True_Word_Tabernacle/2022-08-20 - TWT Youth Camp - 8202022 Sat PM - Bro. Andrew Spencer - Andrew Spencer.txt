[Music] honor [Music] sing blessings [Music] blessing and honor and glory and power [Applause] [Music] amen amen you know a lot of believers of this message we got to the place where we're so revelated so advanced in our own minds so intellectual in our understanding of this message you know until we got so far away from emotion we just can't feel anymore but you know in the simplicity of god someone captured that in a song many years ago a lovely little song that goes like this i sing because that's what it is friends you know if some people leave the seat of the scornful and and join a group of young people like this that's what you would discern in the hearts of sincere young people is a genuine and a and a true and an earnest passion for the word of god something on the inside bubbling a response to the word amen we sing because we're happy it's not a whole lot deeper than that we shout because we're happy we dance because we're happy we say ma'am because we're happy we get excited we feel something many people are afraid of getting a little out of order brother branham said one time and why it has to be shepherds he's talked about that great shepherd when he was smitten back there he said it was finished brother bram said that minute as soon as that shepherd was smitten it was over sin is settled there was no more sin they were clean and the penalty was paid and the believers whose names were written in the book of life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished the very minute that jesus said it was finished amen brother ram said no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hit its face and screamed for joy no wonder all nature broke loose the wind shook the trees until they shook and shook and joyed and jumped because they seen the prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem every name on the book of life and they see that their own nature was redeemed they screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake and the mountains rent and the rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything took place he said that's like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you that it's finished he said i've seen jumping spells and joy spells but there was nobody hurt [Music] but the mountains amen nobody hurt and he said and i've seen meetings where the power of god was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the lord filled the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of god i never did see anything disorderly i never did see anything disorderly i never did see anything disorderly they were always right in order because they had recognized that their name had been written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world when john saw that name written on the lamb's book of life the bible says everything above the earth everything under the earth everything on the face of the earth and everything in the sea heard me john the bride cry blessing and honor and glory and power be to the lamb of god it's in order to worship god it's in order [Applause] hallelujah amen we're not here trying to manufacture anything but when the preaching of the word amen goes forth it causes a reaction on the hearts of the people why because the light which is the manifested word pierce the darkness and by revelation amen reveal to you that you're one of his reveal to you where you came from and what you're doing here and where you're going amen no wonder there be a shout in the camp hallelujah light pierce the darkness if the word would bring a shout it would be a word shall if the word brings a revival it's a word revival if the word would bring a baptism it'll be a word baptism amen a friend of mine said you might think we're a crazy group then go join some other crazy group we're going to worship the lord young people we're here to defend your right to worship the lord with liberty with freedom from the earnest expression of the human heart amen brother branson said we're not afraid of wildfire said don't you think we'd recognize it amen i'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all but i don't believe it is wildfire but i believe it's what brother brown said the pillar of fire amen as it was on the day of pentecost when it divided itself into licks and tongues amen and baptized the souls of men that's what this is this is that this is that how many believe the pillar of fire is here tonight if he's here you can touch him he could touch you he's here friends so i think it would be in order to sing the song that the angel of the lord enjoys amen and whatever you whatever need is laying in your life now would be a time in the presence of god knowing that the angel of the lord is here knowing what a great opportunity that we're facing to have a genuine experience with god then i'd lay aside every doubt lay aside every weight put the past behind you put these distractions of this life out of your mind and only only believe let's sing it together as brother andrew comes [Music] oh [Music] all things are possible oh oh [Music] all things are do you believe that [Music] jesus is here [Music] is he [Music] jesus is here [Music] jesus [Music] here all things are possible jesus is here now lord i believe [Music] lord i believe that all things [Music] lord i believe [Music] lord i believe that all things are possible amen that's why we're here we're believers [Music] we are believers aren't you thankful to be a real believer in this day when there's so much disbelief and so much formalism and so much doubt in the world it's it's amazing thing to say that we're standing as believers i tell you we're just living in a wonderful hour i'd like to again just say it's been a real honor to be here in these meetings and uh we certainly appreciate brother ray erickson and true word tabernacle for putting on these meetings and brother ray's just a he's a real leader and i've watched the spirit of the lord in his life and [Music] he's just a real general and i think the bride is is very blessed to be able to set here because of brother ray erickson putting on this meeting we just say god bless you brother ray [Applause] he told me last year at some point he told me he said he said now you can never take your dad's parties but you do have a part and i thought well i'm just glad to have a part man and uh brother reyes he's fun if you ever want to look up to somebody to be a christian that's that's a general to look up to and i've got a real friend and brother ray and brother wayne here and brother wayne i there's just not enough words i could say for for all that you have meant to me and my family and god's blessed us in life to think that tonight that we're shoulder to shoulder with believers of like precious faith and to know that tonight we're sitting right beside believers that we're going to be setting beside on that day we're going to make it and while we're here we're going to thrash the devil this could be the last service that we have before the rapture and i'm not planning on backing off i got some young people that i'm looking at that's worth fighting for and you're looking at one guy when i get in a fight i don't know how to get out of it until we win so so let's just let's just throw down some knuckles tonight and [Music] i'd like to sing tonight if we could well jesus i'll never forget what you've done for me jesus i'll never forget

[Music] what the lord had done for me what the lord has done for me how can i forget yeah the same god is right here right now and he's willing to work in your life if you'll just let him [Music] now tonight the enemy will be defeated tonight we have needs amongst us that we will not forget what the lord does here tonight and i'd like for you tonight if you wouldn't feel uncomfortable to take your brother or sister by the hand and let's just bind our hearts together in this meeting and let's ask the lord to take control of this service father we're your children and lord what an honor it is to be standing here in your presence lord to recognize lord that we are insufficient on our own and father lord you see each and every person that is sitting here tonight lord you see where they are father in their spiritual walk you see where they are in their natural life and father i pray lord that you would arrest every spirit just now lord that would try to hinder this service or the move of god over their life the spirit of the lord is here lord we sense it father and we know that you haven't inhabited the praises of your people father you have done so much for us now father tonight lord these children lord they have needs amongst them lord that they need to see you they need to handle you here tonight father lord this meeting will be over shortly within the next hours on time as it were lord we'll go home to our our our home churches father but i believe tonight with every fiber of my being that we will go home completely different and father i pray lord as we stand here i ask that the mighty angel would follow them home and i pray that you would set them free father from every stigma every complex every fear father and lord i'm not going to be able to go home with them all i'll be their friend but father you'll be there when i'm not there you'll be there when nobody else is around them and lord that is our desire to not is that to see you high and lifted up to see souls changed and we invite you to come and take the pulpit just now father preach to us through the living word in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of joel chapter 2 verse 23 and then down to revelations chapter 10 verse 1. i'm happy to have my my wife and my two girls with us this this weekend and it's a real honor to honor to have her with us and you know the lord know who in life who needed a whole lot of church and i guess the lord knew that my wife needed a whole lot of it so so he had to i have to pack her around with me you know so i got an uncle that tells me that so that's that's why i'm telling you but sister katie is a she's a real [Music] she's a real asset to the team and she's she's been there and she's tucked me away many times and seen the good part of and the bad part of it and i can imagine life without her and and young boys you you get you a good wife and it's a real joy to you young girls get you a real man do you love the lord tonight i'd like to speak to you tonight on when heaven turns loose when heaven turns loose be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain and the former rain and the latter rain in the first months and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great army which i sent amongst you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed can you say that my people shall never be ashamed my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions revelations chapter 10 and verse 1 and as you're turning there brother branham said each one of you here is standing as believers then the life that was in christ is in you it can if you could just see it he said it's the devil's business to keep you blocked off from that it's the devil's business to keep you blocked off from being a real believer but it's god's business to open it up to you revelations chapter 10 and verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on when heaven turns loose so why don't you turn to your neighbor give them a high five elbow them and tell them let's have church it's all right y'all can do that in the back there too when heaven turns loose so let's let heaven turn loose in this place tonight hallelujah let's have church i think it's an amazing thing that we can stand here this evening and we can preach to this most powerful young people that's ever been upon the face of the earth and we can we can preach to them from an open book to not not not so not saying something or not preaching to them something that we're not aware of but we've had we've had a prophet that would stand here in this in this evil day and stood here and preached to us the revelation of the seven seals and i think it's amazing thing that we can stand here and we can preach to these young people and recognize real realizing and recognizing what has been released in this hour is that none other than the holy ghost and that's what you have been experiencing throughout your walk and throughout this week and you have been experiencing that of the holy ghost and that what you feel in this atmosphere this evening has has been said and electrified is that of the holy ghost and maybe maybe you're new to this and maybe you've never been accustomed to this don't you be nervous about what's going on here tonight it's just heaven that is coming down upon its children just like earlier in the day there was a there was a bad storm that came through here and many of you got caught out and caught out in the rain and it was the rain that would begin to fall and there's a lot of people that don't like to look at the rain but i enjoy the rain i enjoy hearing the rain hit on the metal roof and i enjoy watching it fall because we recognize that it's the rain that brings life it brings new life both naturally and both spiritually you can't live without it and you've got to have it and we recognize that there's power in the rain and we can look throughout the bible and we see a type of noah that that there is such power of rain when it had not rained had it not rained before but god had given noah in his ministry to go out there and build an ark and he told him that it was going to rain and and you watch the power of that rain as it would begin to fall for 40 days and 40 nights that it covered the whole entire earth but you find that when the bible said that in genesis 8 that the bible said that the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained and you see thy rain stopped in that day but i want you to recognize that the rain that is falling in this building tonight and upon this generation and upon this bride it's a rain that will not be stopped that what you are witnessing is not that now of a teaching rain but you are under a harvest rain it is what what william branham said would bring us rapturing faith he said it's a harvest rain or it's a rapturing faith and we recognize that that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and you remember when william branham is up there in mishawaka and he saw how the spirit of the lord fell on this brother and that brother and you know the story how that he sat there one was a real christian and one was was a man that was running around on his wife and those things what was it brother branham went up there in his cave and he found out that it was a rain that was falling on the just and the unjust but you recognize that the rain was meant for the wheat but yet those that were those tares that were there it wasn't meant for them but yet they were rejoicing under that and we recognize that they are that we're living in an age where we've seen such carnal impersonations like never before and you get you get caught up young people and you see some people that that get excited at youth camp they get excited under the anointing and man they can run all over the building and they can shout all over the building and then they can go back out and live the way the world does you recognize they are under that reign just because you see a counterfeit does not mean that it's not right or that it's not real you recognize that the rain is falling and the rain is for you and i'm going to say this to you tonight it is this holy ghost rain that will fall upon you and it'll change your mortal bodies it'll change your thought path it'll change your channel it'll change your ideas it'll change you it's the same rain that was falling on abraham and it changed his body i tell you what you're witnessing is that of the holy ghost this is the third pull and we recognize that i know i know that you're going to sit here and you're going to see things that go on here that maybe disturb you this weekend but i want you to know that under this third pool there can be no mimics there can be no carnal impersonations and you might see people that would rise up and work under the first or the second pool but there can be no mimics the devil doesn't know what to do if this third pulled people that's why i have the liberty to be able to preach to you that heaven has come now that the mighty angel is right here right now and we recognize that he's willing and wanting to get into your heart change your life and supernaturally charge you with the baptism of the holy ghost and i'll tell you this if you completely surrender to him god will take over your life he won't be some put on he won't be some makeup it won't be some workup it'll be the same power it'll be the same power that fell upon the day of pentecost this second rain is a holy ghost rain and it is a rain that produces the crop and i'll say this i believe with everything that's within me this is the final generation we are sitting here tonight and i believe that every one of us are sitting here we are the final runners a final voice and we've got everything we have need of to finish the race so let us run [Music] if heaven's come down let's go to him and let's run with everything that's within us [Applause] i'll tell you what there's an angel that is amongst us to do the supernatural maybe you don't witness him right here tonight but i'm telling you that that pillar fire that you watched in houston is right here tonight maybe you don't see him tonight but i'm telling you that he's here because we have the word of the lord that tells us that he's the same yesterday today and forever and you might be sitting here and say well i'm not getting anything but i'll tell you this that god's got angels in place to feed his children he's got if he had porters up there when elijah had went up there and he shut up the heavens and those crows came up there and fed him when he was up there at the brook of teresa and he went up there and they fed him the porters were feeding him up there when the rest of the world was in famine but yet elijah was feasting on those sandwiches and brother branham had a man challenge him one time he said you really don't mean to think that that man that elijah was fed by sandwiches he said absolutely i believe he was fed by those porters they was giving him sandwiches he said where did it come from he said well i don't know where it came from he said but i believe he did it he said well i don't understand why these people shout and i don't understand why they get so excited he said it's the manna that is falling down upon them and i'm telling you that heaven has come down you know you know you know that which was given interpretation of danny henry and those things that was there and that thing that the thing that was spoken when he said that this could be revelations 23 you remember when he went in there and you remember what he said because of your momentous decision a huge portion awaits a huge portion of heaven awaits you now that's not that brother branham gets a bigger slot in heaven but i believe with everything that's within me that heaven had come down and i believe what you are witnessing amongst your young boys and amongst your young girls is heaven coming down i don't have to preach to them some low down nonsense that they can barely live we can preach this full message to this young people because heaven has come down heaven's opened it up heaven's released itself and there's a huge portion of heaven that's here brother branham said in the key to the door he said he said i believe in the full gospel every word of god that turns the power of god loose that turns his blessings to the people he said it's the key to the door that unlocks it and to think that tonight that the full gospel is what is the key to unlock the door and to think if you can stand here and you can believe this word if you can accept this word and it's preached in its entirety that it'll lose heaven to your situation so what i'm trying to tell you is that you're not just another association you're not just another group you are the elect of almighty god god chose you before the foundation of the world and if god chose you he can't unchoose you you see you were the one that had god seen before the foundation of the world and i'll say this there's not another church there's not another creed there's not another dogma that can unmatch the identity of the bride of jesus christ the restoration of gifts of pentecost and on azusa street man it looked close but yet it wasn't the full wheat but there is another people under their messenger who is a final voice and we're standing here tonight there's not one anybody that can match the similarity of the blood of jesus christ you are the gene seed of almighty god and i'll tell you this we're not just some donkey or some mule where we're some hybrid where we don't know where we came from we are we have a pedigree we're like a pedigree thoroughbred we know where we came from we know who our daddy is and we know exactly where we're going and when brother branham is preaching on the adoption series he said there's coming a time when sons of god when there will come a time of manifestation of sons of god will walk out there and take the very power away from satan i'm telling you that you are that generation that is under the obligation of heaven to take satan's power away don't you let depression rule you you rule it this is the believer's domain and it reaches from eternity to eternity it's time you start rising up as a son and daughter of god and taking anxiety away from satan taking depression away from him taking your troubles away from him rise up young boys rise up young girls you are under commission and god never departs from his commission it's time to rise [Music] i had a young man i had a man that was working on my house not too long ago a carpenter he was working on my house and he got telling me a real nice guy i believe he's coming to the message real soon but anyways he got he got to working on my house and he began to tell me he does a lot of work for for a lot of people with some big wigs and he got to doing some work for a ambassador of a country that lived here in america lived up there close to washington dc just on the outskirts of it and he began to tell me he said no he said i go up here and i was building this i was building this thing for him this project for him he said but i found out when i went up there he said because he's an ambassador he said when i went up there even though he lives here in america he said i was on his national turf because he was under that ambassador and he said when i was up there i was on his soil so let me tell you this this is not satan's domain this is christ's domain this is your domain and you can look at hell right in the face and say this is my turf get your filthy hands off of god's property you have no right you have no authority this is my turf i am not going down the layout i see it or lose heaven come down for me brother marion brother branham in 1956 he stood there and he preached a very powerful message on the junction of time you ain't listen to it i admonish you after this meeting to go and listen to it one of my favorite services it'll do your heart much good but there brother branham tells us in a junction he said angels appear prophets arise and signs and wonders appear at the end time and at every junction and we recognize that counterfeits arise at the junction and we recognize what a junction is it's a blending it's a blending of a roads it's a change over in the roads and right here we are as a church of the living god and we're standing here in the blending of time and the blending of eternity and we recognize that the angels are here signs and wonders are here and the omnipotence of almighty god is here to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever don't get your eyes on the counterfeits don't get your eyes on the ones that are walking away don't get your eyes on this that or the other you keep your eyes focused on the angel young people let me tell you when you're all alone he's still there when you sin all you've got to do is repent and he'll come back to you the dove may fly away when you backsled but i want you to know that there is a water that is coming from the rock and he's still in speaking distance from you he's not that far if you'll just go to talking to him he'll open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing on your life when you think he's not there he's always there when you think he isn't looking he's always looking when you don't think he's making a way he's always making a way when he don't think he's working he's always working when you don't think he's healing he's always healing when he don't see him moving in your life he's still moving in your life when you don't feel like winning that means you are winning because there is somebody that's bigger than me that's standing at this pulpit and it's charging you to recognize that all heaven has come down for the church of the living god he said it always takes the miraculous to speak of the omnipotence he said omnipotences they're all powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do that he said teaching the word is a very fine thing he said but faith comes by hearing and hearing the word he said but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotence still lives and reigns he said we must have the miraculous and i believe that the church is now standing on a threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known and there ever has been and to think that you're right here you're right here at the threshold what it is is you are that how many is a believer tonight how many is filled with his spirit you are standing here as proof of the omnipotence you remember when moses was back there when he was back there under egypt before god ever did one thing he proved to them the supernatural and it was a supernatural that liberated egypt from their bondage you see what god was doing is he was working out his word i'm going to tell you i'm going to tell you what brother random said in the junction he said how can a great turmoil in this world that we realize that's caused that the bible said that spirits great spirits has came down evil spirits and god unto the people and they've done these things and we just see the same evil spirits working in our day i'm going to tell you we've never seen such a release of the power of hell like we're witnessing right now but notice what brother branham says right here he said but notice again that not only that he said when all hell turns loose oh heaven turns loose also you see what god is doing what he said in isaiah 59 that when the enemy comes in like a flood that god would raise up a standard so what is it it's god responding so there's evil that's being poured out but there's good that's being poured out there's supernatural devils that are being released that were held back there under revelations 9 when william branham goes in there in the feast of the trumpet and he goes in there and he lays out the borders for the supernatural believers in this day he goes in there like joshua and he lays out the borders and said this is yours go in there and possess the gate of your enemy footsteps means possession and william branham lays out the borders he lays out the borders but he goes over in there in matthew 24 and 24 and he tells us that false christs and false prophets would arise in the last day that if it were possible that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible but it ain't possible god chose you god elected you god qualified you and all hell can't stop you i'm telling you that god will have a testimony god's wanting young boys that'll rise up and tow the line with satan and say i will not back off of my god i will not back off of these blood-bound promises i will not back off of this message god had some young men by the name of joshua and caleb that was willing when everybody else said they wouldn't go when everybody else said it was too big for them when everybody else said there was too many giants out there for them there was two young boys that walked outside and said we're more than able to go in there and conquer that land what did brother branham said he said caleb and joshua came walking back the evidence now you might get mad at me mamas and daddies and maybe pastors that are sitting here that don't have the holy ghost but let me preach to you this there's going to be some young boys and some young girls that walk out of this this camp walking back to the evidence of the holy ghost and will prove that this message is alive and it's working right here it's time that you start walking back to the evidence when god when satan says there is no more holy ghost walk back the evidence joshua was elected to do it and so is this church of the living god brother branham said in the invisible union of the bride he said the pentecostal church is in no commit in no condition to finish out the great commission he said but it'll be an elected people that's elected for it so you are an elected church of the living god to carry out the great commission [Applause] i'm not looking at a bunch of weak christians i'm looking at strong christians that same mighty angel is anointing you to tear satan's kingdom down that's a deathstroke to satan when a man takes god at his word he said that's the hardest hitting that satan can get is when a man will take god at his i'm word to tell you what i didn't told you i know how to fight but there were some times that i got into some fights that was a little bit too big for me but i had a big brother i was never dumb enough to fight him i got all the veggies and ice cream and he got all the steak and taters i ain't gonna tell you everything tonight but i'm gonna tell you this i've never watched a boxing ring like we're watching right now cause we got some young girls that are taking god at his word and they're hitting satan with it we got some young boys that are throwing down depression and throwing down anxiety and throwing down suicide and throwing down homosexuality and saying i'm not going to be a part of that i'm going to come out of it and i'm going to lay my life down and i'm going to come to the cross and i'm going to come over here and i'm going to take back what was rightfully mine and i'll tell you this there's no weapon that is formed against the bride of jesus christ that can prosper there's going to be a young boy that says i'm sick and tired of being being held back by change and held back my dogmas held back my creeds brother branham said that the church had been bound that the spirit of god had been bound at the doors of dogmas and creeds he said but there's coming a liberation of it and i'll say this you are under the greatest liberty that there's ever been brother branham said in the third seal he said the bride's not received her revival yet he said it'll take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up you are witnessing the greatest brides revival that there's ever been that's why hell is trying to keep you he's trying to keep you from this open word it's because it will defeat him you better back off me devil i know what i'm talking about and i know where i'm standing at you ain't gonna set on me back there tonight you ain't gonna buy in this service tonight we have come too far we've got young girls that are needing deliverance it's time that you wake up rise up out of your sleepiness shake yourself sampson the philistines are on you i'm not working them up i'm trying to preach to them the holy ghost you sit on me all you want to but i'll call that spirit that's holding you back it's time that you get what these young girls got [Applause] this ain't your service to bind this ain't your service to get here and show how big you are and know hell brother ray should have asked me to preach this message brother ray should have called me to preach this meat if brother ray felt felt by led by god to call you he'd have caught you said don't sit there and get mad at me because brother ray called me get with me let's preach the message it ain't just because my daddy's his friend it ain't just because brother wayne's my friend we are here to tear satan's kingdom down and i refuse to let any devil stand in their way you have to give me some elbow room that's good aunty brother man i'm elected to do it i'm elected to win i'm elected to prosper i'm elected to overcome a prophet announced that i would be here so i am here i am here fulfilling what william branham said that there would be a bride in this last day that would be bone of his bone life of his life power of his power anointing of his anointing it's the same body that's being led by the headship because heaven has come down this body ain't moving without the spirit it's her headship oh oh give up don't you give up that angel's here with this message and he's going to take you all the way in the rapture he's not leaving you he is here to make sure that you're naked he's here to make sure that you get your food he's here to take care of you i'm not worried i'm not worried tonight who's going to get it who ain't going to get it because god is not the kind of male man that drops off the male at the wrong house what god has for you is for you and if you need healing he'll drop off healing at your house if you need deliverance he'll drop it off at your house god is the kind of mailman that he sends a messenger by the way and makes sure that the message gets to its spot i say that that same angel is whirling through this building [Applause] you watch those 120 up there on the day of pentecost they got up there with one mind they got up there with one goal they were united on the same fact and upon the same basis that god was going to release upon them what was spoken over in the book of john then he breathed on them the holy ghost and they went up there and they received that promise on the day of pentecost when peter come out there and he preached to them the inauguration message he preached to them that you shall repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and if you have not been baptized in his name then you have never been baptized the most precious name and it's the most holy name but witness what they were doing up there they were under one union and i wonder what would happen in this place tonight if we'd get in here in the same mind in the same accord into the same union now i know it hurt your feelings back there but it's time that you come up here and unionize with me just for a minute not what i'm i ain't trying to get you to unionize to me but i'm trying to get you to unionize with the bride with the word of jesus christ brother branham said in a union he said a union creates a worship he said a union he said you have to beg people to worship you don't have to beg people to give you don't have to beg people to say amen because they're in a union and when you come in a union it breaks every power that satan's got it holds back the very power of hell when you come here i wonder if everybody here under the sound of my voice just for a moment in time forget about who you are forget about what your last name is forget about what church you came from and we gather under the same goal to see empty vessels filled and watch them shake the world with it i say let god feel them let god do the work [Applause] when william branham goes in the unveiling of god and i'm just going to lay some things down before we go further when william branham comes there and he preaches on the unveiling of god he goes in there and he grabs prophecy he goes in there and grabs joel chapter 2 and he goes into hebrews and he goes in there and he breaks into the greek here's a hillbilly kentuckian breaking into the greek and he goes in there and he starts breaking into god in morphine that god was just he said he's same in his nature he's same in his nature and he cannot change he said but he can't change his form he said he can't change his he can't change his nature he's because he's the same yesterday today and forever he said he simply that same god that was back there in the beginning that was rolling worlds off of his fingertips was the same one that met moses up there on that mountain up there it was him in that pillar fire it was god just simply changing his mask and what brother branham does when he goes in the unveiling of god he goes in there and he breaks into joel chapter 2 he said and it shall come to pass that afterwards that i will pour out my spirit now notice what he's doing he said now we look at that in the english word he said we'd look at it and he said it means vomit up he said but you've got to look at it in the original greek he said it's not like it is in the english here he said to give something that's not of itself he said but he himself poured himself into the church so it's christ in you the hope of glory so what you're witnessing is that which was spoken by joel chapter 2 that this is that that was spoken that it's the same lord jesus it's the same pillar of fire it's the same anointing it's the same mighty hating joy it's jesus christ he's not going to leave you he's pouring himself out he's emptying himself out into the final runners and our lives are here to meet the challenge of the day i'm quoting to you your prophet he goes in there and he says you watch a man with his gifts and you watch him how he's built he's built in such a way to meet the challenge of that day he said and so now you are made creatures a son and daughter of god manifested son and daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate that the true and living god of this hour that the message coming forth in its time and to think that we're right here under the greatest message that's ever been released that's why i can preach to you that heaven has come down and heaven has released itself this is christ that has descended upon the church of the living god we are matching the promise of the archangel when paul goes there in first thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 16 he said the lord himself shall ascend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first and when brother branham preaches the rapture he goes in there and he said he does all three things as he's descending the shout is a message the voice is what wakes the sleeping by but it's the trumpet that is the catching away it's the ascension that is calling a body it's calling a body so what you're under is christ that has descended upon the church of the living god but it's the message that is causing ascension you can't separate me from this message now you know william branham said you can't separate the message from the messenger but i'm going to go a little bit further you can't separate me from this message i am the message i am the fulfillment of revelations 10 8 i am the revelations of 10 11. i am i am the manifestation i am this message the mighty angel is in me i am the fulfillment of the seventh seal i am hallelujah you can't separate me what god has sent for you is for you don't you get mad when god drops off your mail at your house and don't you get mad when god drops off the mail at your neighbor's house what god meant for your neighbors for your neighbor why don't you just thank god that he knew where to deliver that i got the message of the hour in me i got the message of the hour in me i got its truth its power his reality i got the message of the out in me you can't separate me from the message i had the message i had the fulfillment of that bride that was marching on step onward christian soldiers god's looking for a dancing partner a dancing partner i wonder if there's anybody that would like to dance with king jesus now you know you know you're getting in rhythm with music because you're watching the conductor and you're watching the director and everything's in step and everything's in order and you're watching this one take their place and you're watching that one take the place don't get mad everybody's got their part and he said if the conductor says that the days of miracles are not passed then the choir has got to say now i know you i know you don't listen to that message shalom and you've heard it enough if he says that the days of miracles are not passed then the choir says it's time that we start let's stop listening to the devil and we start listening to the one that preached this message he said i'll say the words you just repeat them why don't you start saying what william branham said on the tape and stop taking away from it you'll watch liberty come amongst these young people when you take away from it and when you add to it you are taken away from the authority of the word and when you can stand there and preach it in its entirety you're going to watch some young people that rise to the challenge and beat down the devil i'm sick and tired of the devil beating around our young girls and telling them that they've got to crown themselves with depression and with anxiety it's time that you take your position say heaven's come down to me and i've come to take over ain't no other age has been promised this like in this age of malachi 4 and luke 17 30. john 14 and 12 joel 2 38 this message was to bring you into fellowship with none other than jesus christ not to educate you but to contact the living god that's why he's moving with one purpose is to get into his believing children that's why he's appearing to us he appeared to abraham he talked to him along all of his journey you had some rough roads you had to separate from friends because of this message he had to walk away from family because of this message but abraham there's something coming for you abraham get ready you got to separate from your mother you got to separate from your father you're going to walk in a strange land but where god's leading you he'll never lead you into a mistake he'll never lead you down trouble he'll never lead you down a road that his grace isn't strong enough to get you out of the mess that you got yourself in abraham he's got you abraham he knows where you're going to live at he's already got a spot picked out and you're walking and you're searching for a building who's builder and maker is god and he's watched over your life it's the same one that's been speaking you all the way from genesis chapter 12. it'll be the same one that takes you all the way to genesis 22. you're gonna have to go through some stuff abraham but this elohim is gonna be with you he ain't gonna leave you because there's something in store for you abraham there's gonna come a time when you go all the way through justification abraham and you go all the way through sanctification abraham and then you're going to go all the way in genesis 18 and you're going to get the baptism of the holy ghost abraham abraham just keep walking with jesus just keep on walking god had god has a witness at all times when nimrod was up there and he was building his babylon god had a witness there was one enoch that was walking with god and he had this testimony that he pleased god he walked so much with that hell that he could not leave him here i happen to believe that there's a church there's a group that has walked so close with this elohim that you have lived a testimony that you've lived a life that you cannot leave you here abraham keep walking keep walking keep walking abram i'm no longer going to call you abram but i'm gonna call you abraham because you cannot do this on your own you know you can't do it on your own you know you can't walk up there in genesis 22 with isaac and you know you can't come down without me you know you need me you know you can't live without me you know you'll never make it without me but i promise you that i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you abraham i've got to change your name because i've got to put a part of myself in there and when he put the h in there he put the very breath of god on the inside of abraham he had so much god on the inside of him that he could produce an isaac [Applause] oh brother andrew i'm never gonna make i'm never gonna make it i'm never gonna get through i'm never going to be good enough i'm not going to do it let me tell you when god puts himself on the inside of you you going to make it you're going to produce that's why william branham stood here he said i'll no longer call you church but i'll call your bride so that you understand it you couldn't do it on your own but when god put himself when god poured himself on the inside of you it made you strong enough abraham [Applause] people have made fun of you all your life made fun of you because you've been listening to a voice that's led you down some roads that looked inconceivable to the rest of the world how is this going to produce how is this voice going to produce what abraham's name really means a father of nations how is it going to produce it everybody's mocked you because you've said here under the revealing of the word and they're out there having their fun and they're out there enjoying their time but you're fellowshipping with elohim and brother brandon said you watch the effect of the revelation that it had on abraham now he's here he's right here right now you watch the effect of the revelation that it had on abraham that when he was sitting there with his back turned to the tent and god came down in human bodies and he said gabriel you take this one and michael you tap into this one and here i step in and god blew himself a body and he stepped into it and when abraham watched the effect of the revelation he said my lord you watch the effect of the revelation that it's had on these young people they don't see three gods they don't see jesus as a weaker god or the lesser god they see him who he is don't you be afraid of pastors to preach to them this message they recognize who this is they're sensitive if our little girls are sensitive to the moving of the spirit you can preach to them this message don't you be ashamed to preach to them don't you be ashamed to preach to them the gifts of the spirit god's wanting a body that's in full operation god's wanting a body that he can move in god's will in the body that he can work in heaven is here let him in elohim judge the door let him in don't mock him don't laugh at him now abraham i'm going to take you just a little bit further abraham what you have created has came from you this melchizedek loosed abraham to produced in isaac and this melchizedek has a loose this bride he's loose this bride abraham you can't do it on your own you can walk up there on that mountain you can walk up there on mount moriah you can walk up there and watch with the spirit of the prophecy that was upon abraham when he walks up there with his two servants he said i and the lad will come down again it was a spirit of prophecy that was on abraham that he walked up there and isaac knew how to worship isaac knew how the sacrifice was to be he said here's he said here's the wood he said here's the fire he said but where's the sacrifice but watch the spirit of prophecy that came on abraham my son god will provide for himself a sacrifice now abraham i want to tell you what god has for you is for you and what you've created satan can never take away satan has never been able to produce a creation he's never been anything but a perverter what you've created has come from you and i want you to sit there and have yourself a testimony service abraham i created an isaac i created an atmosphere i created a worship i created a praise i created a dance i created a hallelujah i created an amen and if you've created one cell of worship you've done more than satan ever can he has never been able to create one thing abraham it's your creation abraham abraham i've deposited a part of myself in you it'll be the same lord jesus it'll be the same supernatural god that'll take this bride we'll take these young girls and we'll change their bodies in a moment in a twinkling of an eye don't you be ashamed about what's about what's to happen right here god is not ashamed what he put on the inside of you abraham it's time that you start producing what he put on the inside of you what he gave to you was for you to produce it's time that you start letting up open up and up your mouth and you start doing what he said to do thou must believe and now must prophesy i'm telling you that you are watching heaven turn loose in a generation that there's a people that are under a mark 16 commission you're under a mark 16 commission and you're going to lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover don't you be ashamed of what god's put on the inside of you god put on the inside of your faith god put it on the inside of you overcoming power and you might be of part you might be a part of the cartel and you might be dealing dope and dealing drugs but god is going to have an overcomer god is going to have a weapon in the body of jesus christ he's not planning on laying down his body each time you lay down all of your burdens and come to the lord jesus christ it's time that you wash yourself by the bleeding word i don't know how many we got in here brother matthew but i believe it's more than 120. and if mary the mother of jesus had to go up there you got to go up there it's time that you start walking your way back with the evidence this is the message this is the anointing i don't see nothing i'm telling you get ready i don't feel nothing are you kidding me you'd have to be dead not to feel this you ain't moved me i didn't come here to move the living dead i come to preach to the living i ain't seen the pillar of fire i'm telling you he's here i ain't felt the anointing i'm telling you that it's here elijah why don't you climb up there on that mountain and take a

raining it's raining this is the harvest rain they thought they had it in pentecost they thought they had to form a rain but the prophet messenger hadn't come forth the teaching rain hadn't came but

shoulders get ready abraham you got more gray hair than you ever had and your wife's telling you all about it you know look as good as you once did abraham sarah get ready don't you mock this broad

stronger you know what i feel like i could produce something i feel like i could do something well well you don't know like i know i feel like i could do something in here i feel like a change is coming over me sarah it's time to produce an isaac it's time the change is here step on the omnipotence is here the miraculous here the counterfeits are here you're at the junction but the real miraculous is here william branham said in the seventh seal and i'm closing he said when you see the supernatural come down it's the mind of christ i think i'm right on target what you're witnessing is the mind of christ you're watching a generation defy the odds every generations is 10 times worse and there is a young people right here with the supernatural in their mouth heaven's turning loose john 14 12. ask and it shall be given unto you if you ask anything in my name i will do it john 15 and 7 if you abide in me and my words abide and you ask what you will i'm looking at a people of philippians 4 and 13 that i can do all things through christ jesus who strengthens me this is the generation [Applause] now i don't know where you're at and i don't know where you at spiritually but i guarantee you tonight that the spirit of prophecy is here and i'm gonna prophesy over this generation over these young people just like moses prophesied over top of those israelites you will not go out of here empty tonight it's going to be different tonight there's a change coming don't get scared on me the spirit of prophecy is a testimony of jesus christ my dad told a story for years you probably sat here and heard it but he was on a plane one time he was on a plane one time brother wayne and he was sitting there and he was coming down and you know how as you're coming down to the close of the flight that's where everybody wants to talk to you they don't want to talk to you the whole entire time until it's calm close till you're getting ready to get off and everybody wanted to talk to you then it's smart to do that sometimes you never know what kind of nut you're going to be setting aside there's power and silence there's somebody knows what i'm talking about but he was sitting in between two insurance agents and i asked him said no what do you do he said well i'm a preacher i'm a preacher he said what do you preach well they was pulling it out of me hey so i preached the teachings of william branham i'm wayne now one insurance agent so i know about william branham i know about these stories you probably heard him tell this talk to him along along the way until they got off and brother ron never seen that man again he said i always wondered i always wondered what happened to that guy or where he was at he'd tell that story of meetings thinking well maybe one day i'll run into him again we did we do we do some things just out of the ordinary sometimes we don't always after we get done preaching we we don't feel like fellowship and there's there's you forgive us for that but we're pretty much tuckered out by the time we get done but we did something kind of out of the ordinary last weekend we have a family we have a family that we hadn't had to have a whole lot of fellowship with but we decided we want to take some time and right after brother ron preached and you all know that me and brother matthew are doing a very good job keeping him protected and you i appreciate you bearing with me on that brother ron said he said let's let's let's have some dinner here we go down and there was a family member that came up to meet this family be with them for the weekend he was an insurance agent mother on sitting down there beside him all of a sudden the spirit of the lord says that's the man god knows where you're at ain't that right sister alyssa god knows where you're at when you think what's that mean god knows where you're at tonight god knows where you're sitting at and he knows what you have need of last year we witnessed some very supernatural things right here right here last weekend supernatural to say the least lives were changed hearts were changed young girls young boys went back to their churches filled with the holy spirit there was such a powerful anointing here much like this tonight you remember they they carried me off back there and there were some people that bumped into an angel that same angel is here but i got a real friend here and ronnie long life's been pretty tough sometimes i'm brother ronnie but ronnie long's an overcomer he's a real testimony of this message his brother ronnie was taking care of me and taking me back to my camper last year i told brother ronnie i said mother honey i'm going to give you this handkerchief i'm going to give you this handkerchief inside of it is a prayer cloth that william branham prayed over it's for you it meant a lot to brother ronnie because there were some details there that i won't share right now that the lord knew you know god cares where you are is it okay if i prove to you that god knows where you're at we had a real tragic accident happen to the bride of jesus christ we lost a young boy and a young girl mother charlie and sister rachel brother ronnie and sister felice had some belongings there at their house when that explosion took place ain't that right and he asked sister felice they lost about 75-80 percent of their belongings in that he asked sister felicid was that handkerchief was that handkerchief in there in the explosion he said yeah i put it in there with the rest of your handkerchiefs down in a little box hunted for it it meant something to him but god knows where you're at just last month brother ronnie brother nathan were coming back from australia and they were they were really tired from the meeting they'd walked away brother ronnie come back to a seat where he had been sitting at and he looked underneath that chair he said nathan is that yours and folded up underneath that chair that should have been an explosion was this handkerchief god knows how to take care of you the supernatural is here if god can provide a ram and a thicket if god can provide squirrels if god can provide a handkerchief surely he can produce a change in your life the supernatural is here now tonight as the musicians come and the song leader makes his way tonight we feel to have a prayer line here brother branham believed in prayer lines and we believe in prayer lines we've seen great things happen right here in these prayer lines and i believe tonight that if you'll come here with under a great anticipation that god will meet your need brother chad he will meet your need going to ask that these brothers come and we set this we set this prayer line in order one on one side of one or the other and if you have a real need i'd like for you to come through this prayer line if you feel to do so but i'm going to ask you to do something for me if you've got any secret sense if you've got any unconfessed sins in your life you make those things right right now don't come through this line with unbelief in your life come through here we say well how how quick does it happen you remember when brother branham was standing there and there was a lady that was in that prayer line and she just stepped out for a minute she said god would you forgive me and she stepped back in the line and all was forgiven you do your part and god will do his nehemiah did his part he did his part naaman did his part he dipped seven times according to the word of the lord and when he did his part god did his [Music] these
