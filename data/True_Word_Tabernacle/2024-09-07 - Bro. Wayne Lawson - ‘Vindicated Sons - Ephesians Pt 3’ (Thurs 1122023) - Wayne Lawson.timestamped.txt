[3:49] Ephesians first chapter amen I've uh
[3:52] just been studying it here in this book
[3:54] a little bit and if you're studying
[3:56] along with it and you're listening to
[3:58] the sermons you're you're going to
[4:00] recognize that there um that there's a
[4:03] lot in here and that you can glean a lot
[4:06] in your own studies and things um I'm
[4:08] not a systematic teacher you already
[4:11] know that uh so uh when I say that I'm
[4:14] looking into something or series that
[4:16] means I'm preaching along the thoughts
[4:18] and I'm I'm not going to take a lot of
[4:21] time sometimes to slow down and read
[4:22] some of the areas but but but I like us
[4:25] all to know that these things are things
[4:27] the prophet said amen we're going to be
[4:30] reading the first six verses of
[4:32] Ephesians chapter 1 Paul an apostle of
[4:35] Jesus Christ for the will of God and to
[4:38] the Saints which are at Ephesus and to
[4:40] the faithful in Christ Jesus now Grace
[4:44] be to you and peace from God our Father
[4:47] and from the Lord Jesus
[4:49] Christ
[4:51] now blessed be the God and the father of
[4:55] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[4:57] us with all spiritual blessing blessings
[5:01] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[5:05] as he has chosen Us in him before the
[5:07] foundation of the world that we should
[5:09] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[5:12] love now having predestinated us that's
[5:16] that's not a bad
[5:18] word I actually believe that that is one
[5:21] of the great words of the end time amen
[5:25] having predestinated us unto the
[5:28] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[5:31] himself according to the good pleasure
[5:34] of his will to the praise of the glory
[5:36] of his grace wherein he has made us
[5:40] accepted in the Beloved amen God bless
[5:43] you as you be seated tonight uh tonight
[5:45] just want to take just a few minutes in
[5:47] the word here in the book of Ephesians
[5:50] and I'm going to be speaking to you I
[5:51] want to take a subtopic so if we can
[5:53] title these it helps us later if we want
[5:55] to go back over them uh but I do want to
[5:58] take a subtopic so you can kind of see
[6:00] my focus tonight but I want to speak on
[6:02] Vindicated Sons on Vindicated Sons so
[6:06] we're uh speaking from the book of
[6:07] Ephesians but I want to make it as as as
[6:10] much as I can to attach you or connect
[6:12] you to the point that it's not just uh
[6:15] abstract from the church it's not just
[6:17] something written but it's written about
[6:19] someone and it's written for something
[6:21] so I want to talk to you tonight about
[6:23] Vindicated Sons now here in the adoption
[6:27] series brother bandam has a lot to say
[6:30] about uh about this section of
[6:32] scriptures and and I just love how he
[6:35] says he has blessed us with all
[6:37] spiritual blessings and I want to read a
[6:39] little something he says now now just uh
[6:42] not just to some Apostles or some to
[6:45] this or but he's blessed us with all
[6:46] spiritual blessings and the same holy
[6:49] ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost
[6:51] is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the
[6:53] same holy ghost that made Mary shout and
[6:56] speak in tongues have a wonderful time
[6:58] and rejoice and the things that she did
[7:01] is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the
[7:04] same holy ghost that let Paul on that
[7:06] Old Ship where it looked like it was
[7:07] water logged and was gone and 14 days
[7:10] and nights no moon or Stars he looked
[7:12] out there and every wave had a devil on
[7:14] it glancing and gleaming his teeth he
[7:16] said I'll sink you old boy now I got you
[7:19] now and while Paul went down to have a
[7:21] little prayer there stood an angel said
[7:24] don't you fear Paul this old ship's
[7:26] going to be wrecked Upon A Certain
[7:28] Island go ahead eat your supper it's all
[7:30] right now he come with those chains and
[7:33] little arms and dragging them the feet
[7:34] and said be of good courage men for God
[7:37] the angel of God whose servant I am
[7:40] stood by me and they said Paul don't you
[7:43] and said Paul don't you fear and he said
[7:45] that same Holy Ghost is here
[7:49] tonight that same spirit of God
[7:52] ministering to us the same spiritual
[7:56] blessings amen the same one that was
[7:59] ministering to Paul in that place is the
[8:02] same one here tonight ministering to us
[8:05] amen I want to welcome the angel of the
[8:07] Lord here to minister the spiritual
[8:10] blessings to the church amen he has
[8:12] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[8:15] in Heavenly places in Heavenly places
[8:18] now not just out anywhere but in
[8:21] Heavenly places and that's why we're
[8:22] assembled in Heavenly it means the
[8:25] position of the believer I'm prayed up
[8:28] and you're prayed up the church has
[8:29] prayed up we're ready for the message
[8:31] and we have assembled ourselves together
[8:33] tonight as Saints called out and
[8:35] baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with
[8:37] God's blessing called elected set
[8:40] together in Heavenly places we are in
[8:42] the heavenlies in our souls we Spirits
[8:46] has brought us into Heavenly atmosphere
[8:48] brother there you are Heavenly
[8:50] atmosphere what could happen tonight
[8:52] what could happen tonight would be
[8:54] sitting here in Heavenly atmosphere the
[8:57] Holy Spirit moving over every heart that
[8:59] has been regenerated and become a new
[9:00] creature all our sins is under the blood
[9:03] perfect worship with our hands up to God
[9:06] our hearts lifted setting in Heavenly
[9:08] places in Christ worshiping together in
[9:11] Heavenly places and here's a prophet
[9:14] telling us amen that we have a position
[9:16] in Christ that's a Heavenly place but we
[9:18] are assembled here tonight together in a
[9:21] Heavenly atmosphere amen and a Heavenly
[9:25] place in other words we're not just
[9:26] placed here amen but we have a heavenly
[9:29] atmosphere in this place that God has
[9:32] given us of course we're here tonight
[9:34] knowing that we have found the place
[9:37] that God has gave us and chose us to be
[9:40] in now when did God choose you you
[9:43] that's got the Holy Ghost I love how he
[9:46] differes this because the book of
[9:48] Ephesians is not to just everyone it's
[9:51] to the ones that's received the Holy
[9:53] Ghost it's to them that are in Christ
[9:56] Jesus now he he said so when did he
[9:59] choose you that has the Holy Ghost he
[10:01] said he chose you before the foundation
[10:05] of the world see amen he chose you he
[10:07] foresaw you and knew you and before that
[10:10] was the foundation of the world he chose
[10:12] you and sent Jesus that he might be a
[10:15] propitiation for your sin to call you
[10:17] into reconciliation to himself Oh my he
[10:21] said if we just had a few minutes to go
[10:23] back and pick that up and he immediately
[10:25] goes to Genesis 1 and verse 26 and says
[10:29] later we'll get it a little more he says
[10:31] but see amen God made man he said before
[10:35] he made man he was called Elohim amen
[10:38] how many remembers the quotes brother B
[10:40] talks about El Elohim he said being
[10:43] self-existent one of course the word L
[10:46] is plural but God existed by himself now
[10:50] the word L being plural does not mean
[10:52] plural in person it means plural and
[10:55] attribute but those attributes was in
[10:58] God they were in God they wasn't
[11:00] manifested yet they were in God so he
[11:03] was existing by himself amen but when
[11:06] God began to create he began to create
[11:08] angels and brother B said there it was
[11:11] that's because he wanted to be worshiped
[11:13] is that right he said now of course he
[11:15] was God he says but really he wasn't God
[11:18] in the English way of saying it because
[11:21] God means an object of worship and it
[11:23] wasn't until after he created angels
[11:26] that he began to be worshiped now why
[11:28] did he create Angels because he wanted
[11:31] to be worshiped he desires to be
[11:33] worshiped amen do you know tonight that
[11:36] he's God but he don't become your God
[11:39] until you begin to worship him until you
[11:41] take it in your heart to worship him he
[11:44] is not your God and I don't know about
[11:46] you tonight but I don't want him just to
[11:48] be Abraham's God or Moses's God or
[11:51] brother brandom's God or Brother Ray or
[11:53] or somebody else's God I want him to be
[11:55] my God Amen I want him to be my God I
[11:58] Want To Worship him amen and I want to
[12:00] make him God tonight now I know amen
[12:03] that sometimes we don't feel worthy to
[12:05] worship him but that's all right because
[12:07] you know that he had the Angels who were
[12:10] perfect who could worship him but he
[12:12] wasn't satisfied with their perfection
[12:15] he wanted somebody to worship Him by
[12:18] choice so he had to find somebody who
[12:21] wanted to redeem to worship by choice
[12:24] now he made the Angels he made the world
[12:26] he made he created for six days amen but
[12:29] God still was known as Jehovah when you
[12:31] go through the scripture or Elohim when
[12:34] you go through the scripture in Genesis
[12:35] 1 it's amazing cuz it said in the
[12:37] beginning God created and on the third
[12:39] day God and on the fourth day God and it
[12:41] keeps calling him God meaning Elohim but
[12:44] then it changes in Genesis 2 and it says
[12:47] and the Lord God formed man from the
[12:49] dust of the ground you ever noticed how
[12:51] it changes there from God to the Lord
[12:53] God and it means it's changing from
[12:56] Elohim to Jehovah so he takes a name
[13:00] change when he creates man because
[13:02] brother bam says he's not self-existing
[13:05] anymore he has created something off of
[13:09] himself so whatever man is it is enough
[13:13] in God's creation to make him change his
[13:16] name in other words they couldn't call
[13:18] him by the same name no more cuz he
[13:19] didn't exist he existed with something
[13:22] like him in his image see he had created
[13:26] a temporary God amateur God in other
[13:30] words something off of himself he is
[13:32] Jehovah who means he now exists with
[13:37] family now he's just Jehovah he's not
[13:40] Jehovah Gyra yet he's not Jehovah shamai
[13:43] yet he's not Jehovah rapi yet he's just
[13:46] Jehovah he's taken none of his
[13:48] Redemptive names because he hasn't
[13:51] redeemed anything see but yet we find
[13:54] that because all of that was in him
[13:57] there we find the necess city of the
[13:59] Fall In the Garden of Eden to bring out
[14:02] what God was so his name could be
[14:05] further revealed and how the name
[14:07] Jehovah must unfold now the prophet of
[14:09] God says here's the thing he says now
[14:12] when was we called to be Servants of God
[14:13] now we know we're Servants of God Sons
[14:15] and Daughters of God but when were we
[14:17] called to be so brother man said when
[14:19] oral Neville was called to be a servant
[14:21] he said this staggers me I'll tell you
[14:24] but we got to get some scripture to
[14:25] prove it he says let's see where it is
[14:28] and let's get uh first Peter uh 1 Peter
[14:31] chap 1 verse 19 and 20 brother bam
[14:35] actually has them in the room to get
[14:38] different scriptures I'll just read them
[14:39] for you 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 19 and
[14:42] 20 we're going to talk about when you
[14:44] were chosen but with the precious blood
[14:46] of Christ as of a lamb without blemish
[14:50] and without spot who verily was
[14:53] foreordained somebody tell me when that
[14:55] was
[14:57] before the found foundation of the world
[15:00] but was manifest in these last times for
[15:04] you now let's go ahead and turn to uh
[15:07] Revelation 17 and verse 8 or he can
[15:10] bring it up Revelation 17 and verse 8
[15:13] now the Beast that which thou saw and is
[15:15] not and shall send out of the Maus pit
[15:17] and go into predition and they that
[15:19] dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose
[15:23] names were not written in the Book of
[15:25] Life from the foundation of the world
[15:28] when they behold the Beast that was and
[15:30] and is not and yet is amen when was it
[15:34] from the foundation of the world now
[15:36] let's go to Revelations 13 and verse
[15:39] 8 now if you like to study scripture I
[15:42] think it's a powerful thing because if
[15:44] you reading Revelation 17 you're reading
[15:46] about the Harlot system you're reading
[15:48] about the uh about all these things and
[15:50] always amazes me is right in the middle
[15:52] of it God puts the Lamb's Book of Life
[15:55] and talks about people who won't be
[15:56] deceived by it just in case a Believer
[15:59] is reading that and thinks everybody's
[16:01] going to be deceived by it there's a
[16:03] place in there for you to remind you
[16:06] everybody will worship except those who
[16:08] have their names written in the Lamb's
[16:10] Book of Life in Revelations 13:8 this is
[16:13] right between the image and the Beast
[16:16] the beast in Revelations 131 down to
[16:18] about seven then it changes to the
[16:20] United States and in the middle of it it
[16:22] said and they that dwell upon the Earth
[16:24] shall worship Him whose names are not
[16:26] written in the book of the life of the
[16:28] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[16:31] world Amen now when was our names put on
[16:34] there the lamb was slain from the
[16:36] foundation of the world when God was
[16:39] Elohim the self-existent one when God
[16:42] was Elohim that's when he put our names
[16:44] he said he put our names there and then
[16:47] he slayed the lamb from the foundation
[16:50] of the world now I know this will shock
[16:52] you a bit but brother Bram said the
[16:53] blood of Jesus don't save you he said
[16:56] actually it kept you saved
[17:00] amen see therefore the blood is only for
[17:03] the
[17:04] redeemed amen therefore see God seeing
[17:08] he knows and that's why the brother Ram
[17:10] says predestination is really not a bad
[17:12] word if you understand it because
[17:14] election looks to for knowledge and
[17:16] predestination looks to Destiny
[17:19] predestination looks to something see it
[17:21] looks back here I was a cuckle bird born
[17:24] in sin shaped in iniquity come to speak
[17:26] in lies born against sinners father and
[17:29] mother and whole family Sinners but all
[17:31] of the sudden I become a weak grain how
[17:34] did that happen it was
[17:36] election God before the foundation of
[17:39] the world see it was election amen now
[17:41] watch what does it do predestination
[17:44] looks to Destiny he looks to where he's
[17:47] going to take you where you and I where
[17:50] am I going see there it is amen for
[17:53] knowledge I'm I'm skipping a bit for
[17:55] knowledge for Sol us knowing that he was
[17:57] a savior
[17:58] self-existence No Angels no nothing
[18:01] Elohim the self-existing nothing but him
[18:03] alone but him was a savior how's he
[18:07] going to save when nothing is lost but
[18:10] he had to have something lost to have
[18:12] something saved that was the plan of his
[18:15] Redemption amen now what we would like
[18:18] to do is disqualify ourselves from
[18:20] salvation because we needed saving but
[18:22] he couldn't use you if you didn't need
[18:24] saving so therefore we find that was
[18:27] where the need of the Lost of The Sinner
[18:30] King is to show the Salvation or the
[18:33] reality of God do you see what I mean
[18:35] for knowledge the infinite God he
[18:38] actually knew now I won't stay long in
[18:40] this but I just want to make this point
[18:42] to you that the prophet is teaching us
[18:44] that God does not run his business so
[18:47] lightly as to as to crucify his son and
[18:51] then see if someone would receive that
[18:54] he said but he actually knew that was
[18:57] people who wanted to be be saved so he
[18:59] crucified his son for your salvation
[19:03] therefore showing you that you were
[19:05] saved before you even came here but you
[19:07] were saved in the mind of God but now is
[19:11] come time to manifest that salvation in
[19:14] the end of the world the same as Jesus
[19:16] was in the mind of God and had to be
[19:19] manifested so is there a bride who was
[19:21] in the mind of God that had to be
[19:23] manifested so here tonight amen we're
[19:26] not trying to be something we're not not
[19:28] but we're actually here manifesting what
[19:31] we originally were in the mind of God
[19:34] before the world began so whatever it
[19:36] was whatever's coming into your life
[19:38] whatever situation that you have
[19:40] interacted do you know this that before
[19:43] you were lost he was a savior before you
[19:45] were sick he was a Healer amen because
[19:49] God needed this attribute to be redeemed
[19:52] therefore he could show who he was amen
[19:55] therefore we find this is the Great
[19:58] mystery that he had hid in his mind now
[20:01] real quickly you if you if you like
[20:03] studying this at home you can go in the
[20:05] master message of Christ is the mystery
[20:08] of God revealed so we're going to tie
[20:09] the adoption Ephesians 1 and Christ is
[20:13] the mystery of God reveal cuz see if you
[20:15] just stay in one area of the message you
[20:17] can start getting what what we uh you
[20:19] know like a focus and you can start
[20:21] determining things or certain ways
[20:24] without using the enlargement of the
[20:26] progression of the Revelation brother
[20:28] Adam brought to us now we're not
[20:30] progressing his Revelation but we should
[20:32] move in his progression and as he
[20:34] progressed we should progress with the
[20:37] Revelation therefore you see
[20:39] predestination now brother BR said we
[20:41] got to see the mystery that he had in
[20:43] his mind before the world began so uh in
[20:47] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[20:48] brother brandom actually tells you that
[20:51] he's going to tell you the mystery that
[20:53] was in God's mind before the world began
[20:56] if you never heard Christ the mystery
[20:58] you definitely need to hear Christ the
[21:00] mystery he will tell you the mystery
[21:02] that God had in his mind before the
[21:04] world began and brother RMA say it like
[21:06] this in in in in in Ephesians chapter 1
[21:09] he'll pick it up and then he'll say all
[21:11] right see this ain't address to the
[21:14] outside amen we can't tell this to The
[21:16] Sinner they know nothing about it this
[21:18] is not addressed to The Sinner so you
[21:21] you have to see we're not trying to
[21:23] address it to The Sinner and sometimes
[21:26] people say well brother Wayne are you
[21:27] trying to PR destinate everybody no
[21:29] because it's not to a certain class of
[21:32] people but to the people it's to it is
[21:35] very powerful and it and it needs to be
[21:38] preached without the the hindrance of
[21:40] our
[21:41] unbelief we need to preach it like we
[21:43] really believe it and we need to believe
[21:46] it like it's really true amen do you see
[21:49] what he's saying to us that he has
[21:51] blessed us with spiritual blessings in
[21:53] Heavenly places this is your position in
[21:57] Christ that he saw you
[21:59] in it's where you stand with him
[22:03] predestinated there's the mystery
[22:06] there's the mystery he before Christ or
[22:08] anything else was ever on the earth you
[22:11] see the great mystery he chose the bride
[22:14] amen now I tell you one of the most
[22:16] powerful scriptures one of my favorite
[22:17] scriptures is in John the 15th chapter
[22:20] he said for ye have not chosen me but I
[22:24] have chosen you amen isn't it beautiful
[22:28] when you realize that God actually chose
[22:30] you of his own choosing that he was the
[22:34] one that made this choice now amen
[22:36] here's what he's saying the mystery is
[22:38] before Christ or anything else was on
[22:40] the earth you see the great mystery he
[22:43] chose the bride knowing that Eve would
[22:45] fall from disbelieving the word it did
[22:50] not surprise him that Eve disbelieve the
[22:54] word the prophet said watch he made her
[22:56] after the original Creation in his great
[22:59] wisdom knowing she would fall he didn't
[23:02] make her fall but he created her so she
[23:05] could fall but when she failed the
[23:07] all-wise god already knew now you'll
[23:10] never believe this but he actually knew
[23:13] you were coming in this end time and
[23:16] when she was falling he knew that Satan
[23:18] had not defeated his purpose but Satan
[23:21] had only set in the plan of his purpose
[23:24] and God had the battle won knowing you
[23:26] were coming before Eve ever even failed
[23:29] now I know you don't think you're
[23:31] important but that's all right in God's
[23:33] plan and economy he had you in his mind
[23:37] in the Garden of Eden and his whole plan
[23:40] rest upon what he knew about you and I
[23:44] listen friends sometimes I just say God
[23:46] you need to reveal to me what you know
[23:48] about me because what I know about me
[23:51] amen I'm not a very good man but what
[23:53] God knows about you you are more than
[23:55] able amen what God knows about you he's
[23:59] anointed you and put you in this age to
[24:01] meet the challenge of the age that we're
[24:04] living in I tell you this you're
[24:06] predestinated of God and there's the
[24:08] mystery when she fell amen from
[24:10] disbelieving the word now you got to
[24:12] keep that in mind disbelieving the word
[24:15] was her fa see he would choose that
[24:18] bride knowing that that would fall that
[24:21] would he said but he would choose a
[24:22] bride that would not
[24:25] fall she was predestinated to fall this
[24:29] bride is predestinated to not fall
[24:31] hallelujah oh glory be to God Amen then
[24:35] that means you're going to walk and if
[24:37] you stumble you're not going to
[24:40] fall this bride will not fall do you see
[24:44] what she's there regardless of what the
[24:46] rest of the world has to say about it
[24:48] they would hold to that word there you
[24:51] are they're predestinated to stand there
[24:54] the adoption of the children of Jesus
[24:57] Christ predestinated this church to a
[24:59] glorious stand you're predestinated unto
[25:02] an adoption you're predestinated unto a
[25:05] stand you're predestinated under holding
[25:08] on to the word no matter what nobody
[25:11] else does no matter what the rest of the
[25:13] world does somebody is going to believe
[25:15] this message and brother I'll tell you
[25:17] this it's not just a general reference
[25:20] God knew you specifically and anointed
[25:23] you and ordained you in the Church of
[25:25] the Living God sometimes we need to get
[25:27] revelation of indiv
[25:29] individuality amen sometimes we have
[25:32] good group mentality we we realize group
[25:35] revelation we realize the need for
[25:37] church and the need to be a part of the
[25:39] body amen but sometimes we miss that
[25:42] there is individuals in the body we
[25:44] can't just rely on being a part of a
[25:47] group but as an individual youve got to
[25:50] have a relationship with God that will
[25:52] reveal to you what he had in his mind a
[25:55] personal relationship of the appointment
[25:58] of almighty God in your life now some
[26:00] people got a good individual
[26:02] relationship and they forgot about the
[26:04] group relationship that's the reason
[26:06] they don't come to church they forgot
[26:07] how important it is to be a part of a
[26:10] group y'all's here so I ain't preaching
[26:12] to you amen you see they forget they
[26:14] forget to make a a little extra effort
[26:17] to be in the house of God they forget
[26:18] that because they've lost the reality of
[26:21] what it means to come together as a
[26:23] group and I know as the days go on
[26:26] people seem like it means less not so
[26:28] much here true word but it seems like it
[26:30] means less but Paul said it should mean
[26:33] more as the further we go we it should
[26:36] mean more to us than it did when we
[26:38] first began amen because group is
[26:40] important because it's the atmosphere of
[26:43] Believers getting together so if it's
[26:46] important to be together as a group then
[26:48] as an individual within the group we
[26:50] have
[26:51] responsibility Amen to amen the word of
[26:53] God and build an atmosphere in the word
[26:55] of God now I know amen some sometimes
[26:57] people say well how what you know I
[26:59] don't maybe you feel like a roller
[27:00] coaster sometimes one guy will say
[27:02] something this way another guy say this
[27:04] something but we're we're at home here
[27:06] okay amen so y'all just go ahead and
[27:08] relax and enjoy the word and if you feel
[27:10] like shouting go ahead and shout if you
[27:12] want to amen the word go ahead and amen
[27:14] the word amen but I if one thing that I
[27:16] I think we certainly want to do is we
[27:19] want to create an atmosphere amen where
[27:22] the power of God can bring Revelation in
[27:24] the room and the anointing can pick it
[27:26] up and begin to move it amen I'm not
[27:29] much on that intellectual and dry
[27:31] atmosphere it just don't it just don't
[27:33] do good for Sons and Daughters of God
[27:35] Amen do you see what it is now the
[27:37] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[27:40] predestinated to the church you see the
[27:42] secret to restore a fallen Eve a
[27:44] prefigure of the church and notice he of
[27:48] course he opened up Adam's side and he
[27:50] took a bride out of Adam amen right he
[27:53] took a bride out of Adam is that right
[27:56] yeah so her body was the word amen right
[28:01] but her spirit Was the Same Spirit that
[28:03] he had amen so he knew that he would
[28:06] have a body he knew that there would be
[28:09] a place for his spirit in the last day
[28:11] now in God's only provided place of
[28:13] worship watch how brother Braham
[28:14] approaches this now don't forget our
[28:15] subjects Vindicated Sons he said now The
[28:18] Headstone is going to begin crying Grace
[28:20] Grace and you have begin to pass from
[28:23] death and Creed into the Living Word of
[28:26] the Living God God's only provided plan
[28:29] for this age see God's only provided
[28:33] plan his sons in this word age is
[28:36] quickened by the spirit like a spark
[28:38] that's lit off of something to make it
[28:40] alive and Now setting in Heavenly places
[28:43] already alive and subject to every
[28:46] promise isn't that beautiful that's what
[28:49] it does see you being a part of God's
[28:52] Gene a part of the word other men is a
[28:54] part of God's word then we begin to be
[28:57] seated together and the entire then the
[29:00] entire body see because there's no
[29:03] leaven among
[29:05] you no leaven among you just the word
[29:09] only amen no leaven see it brings the
[29:12] entire fullness of the godhead couldn't
[29:14] do it in Luther's age somebody say
[29:16] couldn't do it couldn't do it in
[29:19] Wesley's age see couldn't do it in
[29:21] Pentecostal age but in the day when the
[29:24] son of man is manifested or revealed it
[29:28] brought the church back together with
[29:31] the entire deity of God amongst his
[29:34] people showing visible signs manifesting
[29:37] himself like he did from the beginning
[29:40] when he manifested on the earth in the
[29:41] form of a prophet God do you see where
[29:44] it's at we're watching now the sons of
[29:47] this age are quickened by the word of
[29:49] the age they're living
[29:51] in Eve fell from disbelieving the word
[29:56] sons in the end time will be proven by
[29:59] believing the word watch what he's going
[30:02] to bring and things that are to be
[30:03] brother man says see the only way to be
[30:05] a son or daughter of God is you have to
[30:07] have eternal life and there's only one
[30:08] form and that's God's life he said to be
[30:11] a Son of God you had to be in God to be
[30:13] a Son of God you had to always be in him
[30:15] the gene of your life your spiritual
[30:18] life tonight was God the Father before
[30:21] there was even a
[30:23] molecule and you were nothing but the
[30:26] manifestation of the gene of that life
[30:29] that was in God as a Son of God now
[30:33] you're expressed after the word has
[30:36] coming to you to light up this age now
[30:39] Jesus said he was the light of the world
[30:41] but tonight do you recognize that you
[30:44] are the light of this age you are the
[30:47] light of this age you're here to express
[30:50] God's life in you because you're Sons
[30:52] and Daughters of God you get what I'm
[30:54] saying you're made you're setting in the
[30:57] church church tonight because your duty
[30:59] is to
[31:00] Feld the whole thing's waiting to find
[31:03] out who they are everybody's want to
[31:06] know who is this who is this woman who
[31:08] is this bride who is this that Paul's
[31:11] talking about adopted sons and
[31:13] manifested Sons true Sons born Sons Holy
[31:17] Ghost Sons amen pure Word Church who is
[31:20] this they're talking about is it
[31:21] somebody Through the Ages that's why
[31:23] brother bam said churches churches
[31:26] Brides brides but there's got to come
[31:28] one there's got to come a church that
[31:31] has been predestinated unto the position
[31:33] so somebody has been pre-planned to set
[31:36] where your setting tonight God ordained
[31:39] it to be there some people say well I
[31:41] don't know uh if it's right for God to
[31:44] ordain something but you you but we
[31:46] we're just in a an amateur God Amen and
[31:49] sometimes we plan events a year in time
[31:52] we've already got the camp rented for
[31:53] next August we've got February already a
[31:56] speaker coming it's already ready amen
[31:58] because we're pre-planning for something
[32:00] we're making plans we're predes we're
[32:03] making Destiny for something to happen
[32:05] now the problem with us is we have
[32:07] limited knowledge so something could
[32:10] come up to cancel our plans but God who
[32:13] has all power and he also has all
[32:16] knowledge if God pre-plans something
[32:19] amen there's nothing coming up Church
[32:21] there's nothing going to come up that
[32:24] can cancel the plans of almighty God and
[32:27] he's the one that plans your success
[32:29] tonight I tell you what you might as
[32:31] well tell the devil amen you can't tear
[32:33] me up God's already Pro me up amen when
[32:36] God does something to pre-plan for a
[32:38] church amen I pre-plan a sermon amen God
[32:42] pre-planned an age he preplanned a
[32:45] people he preplanned
[32:46] situations and because God could do so
[32:49] he could manifest his glory and his will
[32:53] amen see amen but there Comes A Time to
[32:56] manifest in other words we got a special
[32:58] speaker we don't tell the name maybe we
[33:00] got a special speaker coming amen
[33:03] everybody's wanting to wait who is who's
[33:05] coming you know all kinds of people
[33:07] who's coming well you sometimes you got
[33:09] to wait for it to
[33:11] manifest see then it's manifested then
[33:14] the mystery of it is revealed because
[33:16] the name is put to something then you
[33:18] start identifying a person with an event
[33:21] with a pre-planning and I say this God
[33:23] has pre-planned this bride this church
[33:26] and he did since the foundation of the
[33:28] world and every Prophet has prophesied
[33:30] and every King has known and wanted to
[33:33] understand men have long to see this
[33:36] Revelation some of them getting in a
[33:38] glimpse but the whole thing has been
[33:41] waiting for the manifestation of these
[33:43] Sons brother bam said since the
[33:46] foundation of the world he said for the
[33:48] manifestation of the sons to display
[33:51] them to the church amen I love how he
[33:54] says it he says I'll stop on my story
[33:57] he says maybe uh talking about the
[33:59] prophets of Moses and them some words he
[34:01] said they've waited until this Latter
[34:03] Day for these things to be displayed now
[34:06] if you want to take that word display
[34:07] and run to the Token right quick you'll
[34:09] get a blessing they've been waiting for
[34:11] these things to display they've been
[34:14] waiting somebody to display the
[34:17] attributes of the sons from the
[34:19] beginning amen it it's to be revealed in
[34:21] the sons of God now brother bam
[34:24] immediately takes it to the pyramid so
[34:26] you
[34:27] you study the message you watch the
[34:29] Pyramid of the Statue of the perfect man
[34:31] you watch the pyramid over with Enoch
[34:33] and brother Ram says see there's a
[34:35] bottom but there's a top yes sir see now
[34:38] we're not down there in the bottom of
[34:40] this pyramid we're up there in the top
[34:42] of this pyramid right and and at the
[34:46] revealing of the headship at the
[34:49] revealing of The Headstone that's when
[34:51] it will become clear who these people
[34:53] were that were in the mind of God Amen
[34:56] sure from the beginning it's a pyramid
[34:59] building closer and closer now I don't
[35:03] believe this could happen in another day
[35:06] I believe Ephesians actually Ephesians
[35:08] is wrote I believe it's positioning Us
[35:11] in this generation it's the Book of
[35:13] Joshua can I can I read you something in
[35:15] Acts chapter 3 watch the scripture and
[35:17] he shall s Jesus Christ which was
[35:19] preached before unto you whom the
[35:22] heavens must receive until somebody say
[35:26] until
[35:28] isn't that amazing that Romans the 8th
[35:30] chapter says that the whole thing's
[35:33] waiting until so we we've got things
[35:36] waiting until something now the
[35:39] scripture says it's until the times of
[35:41] the restitution of all things that God
[35:44] has spoken by the prophets now you that
[35:45] study scripture know that's Matthew the
[35:47] 17th chapter Jesus coming off a mount
[35:49] Transfiguration they said we thought
[35:51] Elias shall come he said he has come but
[35:53] he shall come and restore all things so
[35:57] the heavens receive Jesus until the
[35:59] restitution of all things which is
[36:01] Elijah's Ministry opening the scriptures
[36:04] to the end time generation in Daniel the
[36:07] 12th chapter it'll agree with it in the
[36:09] ninth verse Daniel seeing the book open
[36:12] the angel tells Daniel to seal the words
[36:15] and close them up till the time of the
[36:20] End Amen he keeps using the same
[36:23] language in Revelations 10:4 when John
[36:26] sees the Thunders he said the Thunders
[36:28] uttered the voices and I was about to
[36:29] ride and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[36:31] saying seal up the things which the
[36:33] seven Thunders uttered and write them
[36:35] not but in the seventh verse of the same
[36:38] chapter but in the days of the voice of
[36:41] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[36:43] sound the mystery of God will be
[36:45] finished as he's declared to his
[36:47] servants the prophets isn't it beautiful
[36:50] he's telling this all of this is until
[36:53] this seventh angel sounds but when he
[36:55] sounds the mystery of God would be
[36:58] finished I love it in second Peter
[37:01] chapter 1 you can climb the pyramid and
[37:03] you can come and cap it with love but in
[37:06] the 11th verse he said an entrance shall
[37:08] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[37:11] the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ Our
[37:14] Savior Jesus Christ what's he telling us
[37:17] he's telling us amen that something's
[37:19] going to break out in the last days
[37:21] that's going to be about the Vindication
[37:24] of the sons of God that have been
[37:27] predestinated it's a beautiful thing to
[37:29] me in the church AG book brother bam
[37:31] will tell us this he said them Thunders
[37:33] uttered said write them not what was in
[37:35] those Thunders no one knew but we need
[37:38] to know and it will take a prophet to
[37:41] get the Revelation because God has no
[37:43] other way of bringing scriptural
[37:45] Revelation except for a
[37:47] prophet so it was going to take a
[37:50] prophet Romans 8 was waiting on a
[37:52] seventh angel isn't it beautiful that
[37:55] Romans the 8th chapter is directly
[37:57] connected to the seventh angel messenger
[38:00] of Revelations the 10th chapter do you
[38:03] see what it is in the third seal when
[38:05] brother randam is breaking out these
[38:06] seals he says it like this he said the
[38:09] bride it hasn't had a Revival yet that's
[38:12] powerful isn't it with all the things
[38:14] that's happened and no Revival for the
[38:17] bride now we've had we've had healings
[38:20] and miracles and we've had discernments
[38:22] and we've had signs we've had everything
[38:25] happening but he said there's been no
[38:27] Revival for the bride because there's
[38:30] been no manifestation to steer that
[38:33] bride yet now that's in the third seal
[38:36] so some people will read that and
[38:38] they'll look forward and say someday
[38:40] we're going to have a great Revival but
[38:42] in 1964 brother Randon balances it and
[38:45] comes along and says there's a great
[38:47] paper out here and they're praying fast
[38:49] and pray fast and pray he says see
[38:52] they're asking for a Great Awakening for
[38:55] a Revival
[38:57] but what they don't know they've not
[38:59] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[39:02] they feel the pull of the hour but they
[39:04] didn't recognize what's being done they
[39:07] know some something's supposed to happen
[39:09] but they're looking off in the future
[39:11] when it's all already happened right by
[39:15] you now look at this some people looking
[39:17] for Revival listen let me say it real
[39:19] clearly we're not looking for Revival we
[39:22] are the Revival that was prophesied some
[39:26] people don't recognize it amen but to
[39:28] the bride the elect of God she heard her
[39:32] name called and she come out of
[39:34] denomination she feels the pull of the
[39:37] hour now brother Brandon going lay it
[39:39] out very clearly that Revelations
[39:40] chapter 10 and Malachi 4 is the same guy
[39:44] same Prophet but he said that it would
[39:47] turn the hearts Elijah would turn the
[39:50] heart of the children to their
[39:53] fathers it would turn us to the faith of
[39:56] our fathers is that right now watch that
[39:59] adoption message in Malachi 4 what was
[40:02] it that brother random taught so much
[40:04] about adoption that a son would learn
[40:07] his father's business and here the
[40:09] scripture is telling us that Malachi
[40:12] four would give the children the faith
[40:14] of their fathers they would teach them
[40:17] the same thing that their father had now
[40:19] these mystery truth will literally turn
[40:21] the heart of the children back under
[40:23] their Apostolic fathers amen now
[40:26] according to the message of Grace
[40:27] brother M I'mma tie the two things
[40:29] together he ties the Capstone and the
[40:32] revealing of the word together when he
[40:34] says when these Mysteries unfolded I
[40:37] cried Grace Grace unto them so he's
[40:40] telling you that Zechariah 4 the spirit
[40:44] has brought the unfolding of the word
[40:47] that unfolding of the word is the
[40:49] headship of Christ or the seven Thunder
[40:52] revelation of God that was promised to
[40:55] the church do you see what it is it's a
[40:57] capping Stone brother Ram says it in the
[41:00] adoption he'll say it like this he said
[41:02] the capping Stone in the days of the
[41:04] manifestation of sons in the Bible where
[41:07] are we at we're at the end
[41:10] time adoption Part Two Brother Ram says
[41:13] see it's the manifestation it's the
[41:15] making
[41:17] known in adoption part two he said it
[41:19] would be manifested in the last days
[41:22] waiting and groaning for the sons of God
[41:24] to rise in the last days with the power
[41:27] of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age
[41:29] to reveal the secret things from the
[41:31] foundation of the world to bring it up
[41:34] see from the foundation of the world you
[41:36] it's amazing to me that brother bandom
[41:39] identifies this that this man this this
[41:42] Prophet will reveal what was before the
[41:44] foundation of the world then he says now
[41:46] let's go back now and begin to talk
[41:49] about what's before the he said now when
[41:51] this man comes he's going to unfold the
[41:54] mystery from before the foundation of
[41:55] the world he said now let's go back now
[41:58] to the Book of
[42:01] Genesis oh he must be the
[42:05] guy because what he's doing is unfolding
[42:08] something to the church he's unfolding
[42:11] what real Vindicated sons are going to
[42:14] look like the whole world has ideas of
[42:17] what sons are going to be but here a
[42:20] prophet is going to unveil the true
[42:23] sunship he's going to give us the
[42:25] message that will reveal the bride in
[42:28] the last days what has been hid we're
[42:30] living in the last days see see it's got
[42:33] to come brother B said the angel is here
[42:35] now to testify the day is
[42:37] here now that's the reason in the
[42:39] serpent seed I don't know if you've read
[42:41] this one paragraph 149 you'll love it he
[42:44] says see the eyes of the wise and
[42:46] prudent promis to reveal it to the sons
[42:48] of God in the last days when the sons of
[42:51] God will be
[42:53] manifest God's sons that rejoice even
[42:57] before the foundation of the
[43:00] worldj when the Great revelation of the
[43:03] godhead and things would be brought down
[43:05] in the last days he would manifest these
[43:08] things through the sons of God a't that
[43:12] powerful and you know the scripture
[43:15] teaches
[43:16] that and here we
[43:21] are it's
[43:23] amazing that's the reason God is is
[43:26] opening these things to us God is
[43:30] bringing Sons into
[43:34] manifestation that's the reason the
[43:36] revelation of the message has come it's
[43:38] to bring Sons into
[43:41] manifestation see it takes us beyond the
[43:44] limit of human knowledge it takes us
[43:47] beyond the limit of schooling and puts
[43:49] us in Revelation sons of God to be
[43:52] manifest think by the living presence of
[43:54] the living Christ amen now here in 1962
[43:58] Blasphemous names uh brother Bram will
[44:00] say something this is very much where
[44:02] I'm drawing uh this point from Brother
[44:06] Braham says it like this he said see you
[44:08] become one amen this thing out of my way
[44:11] it's hard on your arm see you become one
[44:14] you you you see life you see Christ live
[44:17] together now at that day you'll know
[44:20] that I'm in the Father the father in me
[44:23] I in you and you in me then that's a
[44:26] sealed unit of the
[44:30] Lord now then they are Vindicated and
[44:35] placed when that time takes place they
[44:38] become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of
[44:43] God when this time comes they become
[44:46] Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God see
[44:52] it's way past that guessing stage
[44:54] now
[44:56] it's way past that I hope maybe I might
[44:59] get to be a
[45:01] part this has come to vindicating Sons
[45:05] according to scripture you're
[45:07] predestinated unto the vindicating of
[45:10] sons brother bram's going to enter he
[45:13] literally is going to switch out the
[45:15] words adoption manifesting vindicating
[45:19] placing he's going to keep interchanging
[45:21] them words to let you know that whatever
[45:23] it was God had in his mind is Now
[45:26] setting in the church and whatever you
[45:28] thought a true son is you're looking at
[45:30] Vindicated Sons so this has got to be
[45:33] where your mind comes to see we look out
[45:36] in the future we think Well a true son's
[45:38] got to be this way it's got to be this
[45:39] way it's got to be this way but a true
[45:42] son is a son that's been revealed by the
[45:45] message of the hour that's what a true
[45:47] son looks like it's a true son that can
[45:50] stay with a message that's what a true
[45:52] son looks like it's somebody that stays
[45:55] with the word of God if he was the right
[45:58] kind of son see if he was the right kind
[46:00] of son he would obey his father remember
[46:03] brother R's business he he brother
[46:05] brother uh Ray done a tremendous job the
[46:07] other day so I'm not going to teach on
[46:08] it remember Brother Ray took a farmer
[46:11] and and and I'm not going to teach I'm
[46:12] going to remind you he took a farmer and
[46:14] said he's got a boy in the house but the
[46:16] boy don't know how to farm so he's going
[46:19] to make that that boy raise up and start
[46:21] farming cuz he's got to learn his
[46:23] father's business and someday the Daddy
[46:26] won't be there and he's got to know how
[46:28] to put the seed in the ground he's got
[46:30] to know how to lay the plow he's got to
[46:31] know how to hire he's not he's got to
[46:33] know the business of the father and I
[46:35] tell you shouting ground y'all remember
[46:37] brother brand brought brother brother
[46:38] brandom brother brother Ray brought it
[46:40] up and I thought it was so powerful amen
[46:42] is when he said it like this he said but
[46:44] our father's business is not
[46:47] farming y'all remember that our daddy's
[46:50] business is not farming our daddy's
[46:53] business is vindicating the word word of
[46:56] God that's the business that God is in
[46:59] now I tell you when brother Ram says
[47:01] this he said the secret of the message
[47:04] now is the father's business it's not a
[47:07] secret it's our Revelation at this
[47:10] generation he says what it must be is
[47:12] the father's business the weak cries
[47:14] back what's it doing it's vindicating
[47:17] Malachi 4 it's vindicating Luke 17
[47:21] Hebrews the 13th chapter it's
[47:23] vindicating John 14:12 see Revelations
[47:26] the 10th chapter the opening of the
[47:28] seals what's God doing he's vindicating
[47:31] the word and how is God doing that by
[47:35] the bride who is believing that word she
[47:39] is a Vindication herself of the word
[47:42] that has come in this age God vindicates
[47:44] this to be true and it's the fulfilling
[47:47] of the age the proving denominational
[47:49] has just been characters he said another
[47:52] one of the father's businesses to prove
[47:54] this the father's business is now to
[47:57] show that denominations are not
[48:00] his denomination is not his they are
[48:03] manmade systems that deny the word see
[48:07] what it is is in Luke chapter 18 He says
[48:10] will I find faith when I return y'all
[48:13] remember that remember the unjust judge
[48:15] amen that and she just kept bugging him
[48:17] and finally he answered but the
[48:19] scripture says amen that Jesus is
[48:22] telling us here that the WID of the city
[48:24] of course she went to him but shall not
[48:26] God avenge his own elect which cry to
[48:29] him day and night though bear long with
[48:31] him I tell you he will avenge them
[48:33] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[48:36] man cometh he will find faith on the
[48:38] earth he will avenge them speedily now
[48:40] now if you want to if you want to take
[48:42] time I don't have time to preach there
[48:43] but you want to take time to study it
[48:45] that word is
[48:47] vindicate amen he will vindicate them
[48:51] when you go to court what do you need
[48:54] Vindication when you go and you're
[48:56] actually maybe you're innocent you go
[48:57] before a judge and you're looking there
[48:59] innocent guilty innocent guilty you need
[49:02] Vindication of your
[49:04] innocence and it takes a judge to bring
[49:08] a Vindication of a Believer see you
[49:11] think you're a Believer you say you're a
[49:12] Believer but without the message of the
[49:15] hour you have no proof you're a Believer
[49:18] oh but when the message of the hour
[49:20] dwell upon the Church of the Living God
[49:23] it is the Vindication from the mind of
[49:25] God
[49:26] these are they that withm me before the
[49:28] world ever
[49:30] began isn't it amazing somebody can
[49:32] shake your hand confirm you they can
[49:34] they can we can confirm you that don't
[49:36] vindicate you do you see what we could
[49:38] have all kinds of emotions that does not
[49:40] vindicate the believer right amen but
[49:43] what vindicates the believer is when the
[49:44] word comes upon them and that word
[49:47] manifests itself in their life it
[49:50] vindicates them that they never were
[49:53] there in this land they were in him
[49:56] before the world ever
[49:58] began the Vindicated word see the
[50:01] Vindicated word it's what vindicates the
[50:04] church it's what brings them man I got
[50:07] too much in too little time it's what
[50:09] brings them see it's what brings them a
[50:12] Vindication do you know in in Matthew
[50:15] the 12th chapter that this Bible says
[50:17] that God would show judgment under these
[50:21] Gentiles that God would show judgment
[50:23] under the Gentiles but the Judgment that
[50:26] he brings would be a judgment for
[50:30] victory it will be a judgment for
[50:32] victory the scripture says Matthew 12:2
[50:35] he said he will send forth judgment unto
[50:37] Victory and in his name shall the
[50:40] Gentile trust that's why Isaiah said he
[50:44] would be a light under the Gentiles
[50:47] brother BR said when Isaiah said that he
[50:49] wasn't talking about Jesus in that day
[50:52] he was talking about Jesus in this day
[50:55] he would be a judgment under the Gentile
[50:57] he would bring light under the Gentiles
[51:00] he would Quicken and manifest true sons
[51:03] who were in The Darkness but he would
[51:05] bring light to Spring them and bring
[51:08] judgment and bring life unto them my
[51:11] goodness say too much amen do you see
[51:13] what it is the message is bringing
[51:15] Vindicated Sons when you when you study
[51:18] the message and you you hear Brother bam
[51:20] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[51:22] says what God is doing in this season is
[51:24] bringing life to the body body is that
[51:26] right he's bringing life into the body
[51:30] now the life in the body is Vindication
[51:33] of
[51:34] rapture how do you know you're going in
[51:36] the
[51:38] Rapture you see how do you know apart
[51:42] from someone else that you're going in
[51:44] Rapture do you know that the church
[51:47] today is Vindicated for
[51:49] Rapture the prophet of God said when the
[51:52] life of this word is in you you're
[51:55] already Vindicated for the Rapture the
[51:58] token is
[52:00] displayed so there has to come forth a
[52:02] holy spirit to ripen or vindicate or
[52:05] Manifest this evening
[52:07] light now what this word is this Living
[52:10] Word it's his own personal
[52:14] presence bringing
[52:17] Vindication which proves his church look
[52:20] at that look at that he proves his
[52:23] church how's he do it puts the word test
[52:26] on
[52:29] her he puts the word test on her it was
[52:32] a personal
[52:34] Vindication God In the Flesh personally
[52:37] Vindicated people born of his spirit in
[52:39] this last day in this great
[52:40] denominational Age We liveing the Living
[52:43] God takes his living word and vindicates
[52:45] it personally this life that's in the
[52:48] word The Germ that's in the seed and the
[52:51] word that is s forth to seow the life is
[52:54] Christ
[52:56] in the word personally in you
[53:00] vindicating something you cannot
[53:02] do proving himself that it's not you
[53:06] it's
[53:08] him you've become one with him Len what
[53:12] he's saying Christ it's powerful
[53:14] paragraph 5:28 he the word do you know
[53:17] what's right the word is
[53:19] Vindicated he the word properly
[53:22] Vindicated is headship
[53:29] my somebody get out the
[53:31] way this ain't a headless
[53:34] church it's a church with head see not
[53:38] the headship of
[53:39] Rome it's the personal headship of
[53:43] almighty God you see what he's doing he
[53:46] properly Vindicated that
[53:49] word he is the headship properly
[53:52] identifies his own spirit being in the
[53:55] the
[53:56] church do you see what it's doing it's
[53:58] recognizing this body with his
[54:02] resurrection see he didn't leave us in
[54:04] the grave of the
[54:06] Baptist he didn't leave us in the grave
[54:08] of the Lutheran he didn't leave us in
[54:10] the grave of the Presbyterian he brought
[54:13] us from the
[54:14] grave vindicating by this word you are
[54:19] that that was in his mind to begin with
[54:21] see amen if you had just been another
[54:23] church he would have left you in the
[54:26] tomb but this word had to live so he
[54:30] resurrected you in the power and he
[54:33] Vindicated you with his own
[54:36] headship now life is in the body is a
[54:39] Vindication of
[54:41] rapture now when this church comes near
[54:45] The
[54:46] Headstone she will have his
[54:50] potentials she will be a super Church
[54:53] sir now I I think I think it's amazing
[54:56] to hear this a super Church a super
[55:01] race
[55:03] amen isn't that powerful and you don't
[55:06] have to go to Hitler to find
[55:10] it Hitler was on a pipe dream I'll have
[55:13] a super race but isn't it odd the age he
[55:17] lived that he caught something that
[55:21] there would be a super race but he just
[55:23] missed that it was Abraham's Royal
[55:27] seed amen and it would be a super race
[55:30] because it would be a predestinated race
[55:33] a predestinated church now here's the
[55:37] thing brother bam says and I I think
[55:39] it's a I think it's a very powerful
[55:42] wisdom versus Faith
[55:44] 1962 in these last days every seed is
[55:48] sold everything is in
[55:54] order the time is shaped up the church
[55:57] in its order the seed the evening lights
[55:59] the signs as it was in the days of Sodom
[56:02] an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming
[56:04] down performing signs as he did Malachi
[56:06] 4 promised he would sin we see it all
[56:09] right here amen amen amen
[56:13] amen sure right here in the last days a
[56:16] predestinated church knowing where
[56:20] they're
[56:23] standing sold
[56:25] with the
[56:27] seed isn't that now that's powerful
[56:31] Church they know where they're standing
[56:34] they're sowed with the
[56:37] seed the holy spirit is in the church I
[56:40] love how he says it now
[56:42] Satan be
[56:46] careful the church knows where it's
[56:51] standing do do you see this watch what
[56:54] he's doing
[56:55] Satan be careful because now you're
[56:58] approaching the same thing you
[57:00] approached in the Bible when you came to
[57:04] Jesus see immediately he said if thou be
[57:08] the son looking for
[57:11] Vindication do this do this do this and
[57:15] Jesus did not play any of his
[57:18] games but because he stayed with the
[57:23] word he defeated Satan by staying with
[57:26] the word look at the power of this and
[57:29] the Church of the Living God will defeat
[57:32] Satan anywhere any time any place in any
[57:35] form by just staying with the word when
[57:38] you stay with the word you have you have
[57:40] brought your Victory Satan be careful
[57:42] now I I was just thinking about this uh
[57:45] we're we're going to close very soon I
[57:47] was just thinking about this today and I
[57:49] was just thinking about the snake
[57:50] handling churches out in the Appalachian
[57:53] Mountains you know why they you know why
[57:55] they're handling snakes they're trying
[57:57] to prove right they're
[58:01] believers they think if they carry snake
[58:03] and all this even snakes bite people and
[58:06] they just keep they keep trying to prove
[58:08] it right in the face of death and lot
[58:10] there's been a lot of them
[58:11] buried cuz God never said pick up a
[58:14] snake to prove you're my
[58:17] son I just seen something the other day
[58:19] somebody said that there was a an
[58:21] African Pastor got into a a lion's den
[58:24] with some they said well they were tamed
[58:26] before he got in there though just but
[58:27] he's trying to
[58:29] prove that he's a
[58:31] son but God never said pick up a snake
[58:34] to prove it he never said get the Lions
[58:37] Den to prove it though that did it in
[58:38] the
[58:39] Bible Daniel got in the Lion's Den and
[58:42] Paul shook a snake off in the fire but
[58:44] God never said do that to prove you're a
[58:47] son but the Vindication of your sunship
[58:50] is the message of the hour and as you
[58:53] stay with that word vindicating that you
[58:56] are that bride that was in his mind do
[58:59] you see what it is you're sold with a
[59:02] seed do you see what happened brother
[59:04] Bram says now watch this Satan when he
[59:07] met Jesus he flew into him with all of
[59:09] his ecclesiastical Force I know the word
[59:12] he flew into him denomination dust had
[59:15] that he had he throwed it onto him but
[59:18] it didn't have any life in it yeah he
[59:21] put the word to Jesus but he didn't have
[59:23] no life in it he said did did did he
[59:26] ever fly off he come off a lot quicker
[59:29] than he flew
[59:30] on he hit that 100 billion volt wire
[59:34] there and it singed his
[59:37] feathers well Satan you better be
[59:39] careful you're going to get your feather
[59:40] singed again playing around
[59:43] here he come off of him see he come out
[59:46] of him cuz the wire had a vault in it
[59:49] now watch brother Bradon now Satan had a
[59:51] wire too but no matter how how nice
[59:55] copper the wire it was it didn't have no
[59:58] life in it it was dead see it wouldn't
[1:00:02] act but it was the same wire see one had
[1:00:06] been energized with a diamond o the
[1:00:08] other had no connection that's right the
[1:00:09] reason it'll work in a predestinated
[1:00:12] vessel the reason the word will work
[1:00:14] there because it's connected se but
[1:00:17] where it's connected to a denomination
[1:00:18] it's a dead socket having a form of
[1:00:21] godliness but denying the power see but
[1:00:23] connected with the word see which shall
[1:00:25] never pass away and can produce the same
[1:00:28] power that he had there at glory now
[1:00:29] watch brother Braham says it like this I
[1:00:31] love I love when he gets into this he
[1:00:33] said see it was the same wire Jesus used
[1:00:36] the father's word and Satan used the
[1:00:38] father's word but Satan was Satan and
[1:00:42] Jesus was
[1:00:44] God see that's the difference one is a
[1:00:48] Creed and the other one is the word one
[1:00:50] is true the other is false one will
[1:00:53] produce it the the other can't produce
[1:00:55] it the same kind of wires see Hebrews 2
[1:01:00] 4 and2 said we just got it like
[1:01:02] denominations by wisdom denominations by
[1:01:04] wisdom says the days of the current is
[1:01:08] passed so what they do they got the same
[1:01:11] wire but the days of the current has
[1:01:14] passed so brother Ram says but watch
[1:01:16] this now he says see Lord this is my
[1:01:19] prayer take every believer in here and
[1:01:21] put current in them put life in them let
[1:01:25] him buzz and Shine for the glory of God
[1:01:28] turn on the current you know what I
[1:01:31] believe the seed has been
[1:01:35] sown you believe that he said for the
[1:01:38] great church and I love how he says it
[1:01:41] the LI the wires have all been laid out
