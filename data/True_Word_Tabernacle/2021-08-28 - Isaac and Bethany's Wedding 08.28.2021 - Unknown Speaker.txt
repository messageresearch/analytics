beauty grows [Music] full of gladness in the times of pain it's great [Music] shines on me [Music] your grace it shines on me shines on me shines on me it's your grace god bless you bethany brother isaac thank you for having me to be a part of this incredibly special occasion today we have a wedding of royalty the world may not recognize it but royalty is of two families both families of royalty we step out of eternity to into a space of time we're pre-planned before the foundation of the world our names are written in the lamb's book of life today one of the photos of the lamb's book is standing before us i would just like to say this to you that eternity and time has came to a pause today and not only do we have an incredibly distinguished guest all around this building and people watching throughout the internet but angels are standing watching for the attributes of god's mind are on display from one family gathered from this source and another from this source and god is in control of this whole situation no doubt there was a time that you just passed by and she was just another girl but there was a day that something clicked and you couldn't think of nothing else but her do do i want to live i'm not going to address her in that way this is a union that god has built he pre-planned it we can't remember standing in eternity but we're standing here in time time has elements to where that it's great joys and deep sorrows but god knew that man should not be alone you see just as much as he gifted you to follow in the lineage of your family to be a minister god will ordain you to carry his word and it's the greatest thing that any person could ever have greater than the president of the united states of america but he designed it that you wouldn't do that alone but today is a reflection of what god did in the garden of eden it was there that god created his own image his son from spirit form to flesh form but he didn't want him to be alone so he performed an operation on him and took out of his side and what a wedding that it was under the canopy of the garden of eden those two when his eyes fell on her it was kind of like what happened with your eyes just a few moments ago you didn't see 400 guests but the most important one in the room stepped out may that never leave your life now jesus had placed that in adam to be lonely because he desired a wife so he had prophets to come and talk about how it would be even isaac and rebecca to be a perfect portrayal of that to take place but prophets couldn't bring that as a manifestation and they couldn't redeem no one not even themselves so jesus left the our palaces of glory and took upon himself the form of a man he walked and he talked well he thought so much of the weddings until his first miracle would be performed at a wedding and it was a not by just a spoken word but it was creativity he turned water into one now he's here today to take two people and make them one as you go and your marriage will be blessed children will come whether you know that or not but the time of their manifestation will come on the earth and god has designed that in his mind how that a minister up here in lime ohio and his family and then in the predestination he brings a guy named wayne lawson to come and be a blessing to this audience and he brings an arkansas girl here he knows how to move his seed from one state to another and maybe in our mind's eye we cannot figure out god what are you doing but he says i've got to have these two kids to get married and no doubt the angels are standing watching and they've been watching all the time and kind of helping in the in the line of duty but they've been watching all of this to come to pass and so today jesus is not stirring the water to make it whine he's stirring the very spirit of god because every couple in this room renews their vows and realizes that marriage is so incredibly important i would just remind you today that every day is important amen never take for granted one day because this life is so short and we don't know what day that our lord jesus will call us home so you make sure to not let one day go by without you spending time with yourselves and with our lord jesus now remember this he wants to be the unseen guest in your home he wants to be there in every conversation and he's always near great times bad times difficult times physical troubles financial issues great decisions that have to be made choices of life that you'll have to make he's always the head of our homes you're a real man you're a prince of a family your family has done an incredible job of raising you to be a real man you're the description of what this message is you're that description what is the message you are that you're the description of what all of the sermons and all of the incredible services are about you are a great compliment to your grandfather's ministry gifts came through your family and they've come from one generation to another now you can't preach but god has gifted you above many others to be anointed to write songs and to sing them now your atmosphere when you strum a guitar and you begin to sing it actually changes the environment of the entire room amen why demons run for cover because of god's place to gift in your life not to speak like your dad but to sing whether you know this or not i bring this up because that your gifts will now be elevated because you've become one your sermons will have more depth they'll have greater understanding because there's your greatest fan will sit in the room and she will be praying for you like no other minister your songs will have incredible meaning and they will be inspired from another realm and god has so blessed you brother branham stands and speaks choosing of a bride and he says a man will choose a woman that reflects his own character now we really couldn't see the inside of you until today and i would say the inside of you looks real well hey god is the author of love amen it is him that brings us together it is love that will carry us through the most difficult storms love conquers all it conquers every demon it conquers every power it is the greatest force on the face of the earth is love in saying that let nothing come between you two and if it does recognize it is a spirit from another realm and ask the lord jesus to take that away my greatest admonition to you today is the word forgive is a powerful word i just want to say this to you adam isaac jesus god preached adam's wedding i want to say this to you isaac remember this day mark this day on your calendar oh sure it's your anniversary but this is the last day you'll be right there was about 200 amens in this building all from the sisters the word of god tells us that love is like if i speak of tongues of men and angels but have not love i'm only a resounding brass and a sounding symbol if for the gift of prophecy i can fathom all mysteries and knowledge and if i have faith to possess all things my body is a could be given to the flames but if i have not love i have nothing love is patient love is kind it does not envy it is not proud it is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs if you hear nothing else today it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with truth it always protects it always trusts it always hopes and it always preserves today is an image of when god brings us home amen all the angels of god will stand and they'll look at us as we walk in to our new bodies and walk into that celestial place as a husband and wife arm in arm walking into the kingdom of god singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me and all the angels will watch and they will go this is what that was about i say god bless you to you both i love you with all of my hearts you take good care of her if you don't she's going
