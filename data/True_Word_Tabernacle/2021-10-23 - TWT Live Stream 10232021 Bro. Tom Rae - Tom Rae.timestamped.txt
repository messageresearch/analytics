[43:30] and that that is special and then
[43:32] brethren of like precious faith
[43:35] it's just uh it's just special whether
[43:37] you can go to
[43:38] america europe around the world
[43:41] and rejoice around the same body word of
[43:44] the son of man
[43:45] and
[43:46] i just put your mind at ease right now i
[43:48] have no special doctrine
[43:50] i just tom brother tom ram simple

[45:12] pharisees it confused them but then when
[45:15] the bride came on the scene she started
[45:18] to realize if she is him
[45:20] and he's come from god and going back to
[45:23] god then if she's in him
[45:26] she's come from god and she's going back

[50:01] okay it just keeps fitting pages out
[50:04] what on earth is that all about i'm only
[50:06] gonna get to page two
[50:10] all right you got about 20 pages
[50:13] really and they're going to stay for 20
[50:16] pages never
[50:18] but we'll just we'll find a nice spot
[50:21] lord willing and we'll continue on
[50:22] tomorrow morning i mean it's friday
[50:25] night listen i'll tell you what when i
[50:27] was in the world friday night was the
[50:28] big night
[50:30] it was you worked all week all week for
[50:32] friday night then you just let it loose
[50:35] then you couldn't even hardly get out of
[50:37] bed the next morning
[50:39] huh then saturday well my goodness this
[50:42] is saturday night and that was when you
[50:45] just
[50:47] craziness
[50:49] and then sunday was obliterated because
[50:51] you didn't even know that there was a
[50:52] sunday
[50:54] but by the grace of god we got saved
[50:58] and so the
[50:59] special saturday nights and the friday
[51:00] nights that we thought we had in the
[51:02] world
[51:03] are nothing compared to what we have
[51:06] in the presence of the lord amen
[51:09] praise the lord
[51:14] amen well
[51:16] god bless you let's down to our feet us
[51:18] open our bibles
[51:22] let's turn to uh first corinthians
[51:25] please chapter 13.
[51:30] and we'll re start reading at verse 9 to
[51:32] 13. now brother
[51:34] um wayne had asked me to write down some
[51:37] scriptures for the brothers to follow up
[51:39] and put the different quotes up but
[51:41] that's dangerous to me
[51:44] no
[51:45] i don't have to stay with my okay that's
[51:47] very dangerous because i even you know
[51:49] the brothers at home they say what's
[51:51] your title
[51:52] and by the time i get to the platform
[51:54] i've got three more titles
[51:56] so the title i gave them is not the
[51:58] title i got and i said what did i preach
[52:00] on anyway
[52:02] so we'll just preach okay
[52:05] so let's turn to we've got there first
[52:07] uh corinthians 13 verse nine
[52:10] the bible reads for we know in part and
[52:12] we prophesy
[52:14] in part
[52:15] but when that which is perfect is come
[52:18] then that which is in part
[52:21] shall be done away when i was a child i
[52:23] spake as a child i understood as a child
[52:26] i thought as a child but when i became a
[52:28] man
[52:29] i put away childish things
[52:32] for now we see through a glass
[52:35] darkly
[52:38] but then
[52:40] face to face
[52:42] now i know in part but then shall i know
[52:46] even
[52:47] as also
[52:49] i am known
[52:50] let's bow our heads one more time father
[52:52] we've read your eternal word and it is
[52:55] alive tonight
[52:56] i pray god that you'll inspire it to
[52:59] both speaker and hearer that lord the
[53:01] word of god will come to the hearts of
[53:04] your children meeting the needs of each
[53:08] and every one of us we ask it in jesus
[53:10] name amen
[53:12] amen you may have your seats
[53:15] i'd like you now to turn please to
[53:16] revelation chapter 10
[53:21] revelation chapter 10.
[53:30] revelation chapter 10. of course we know
[53:32] revelation 10 1 and the mighty angel
[53:35] descended we understand
[53:37] that that has been fulfilled and we are
[53:40] church well fed here so i i'm just going
[53:43] to hit the highlights of this and so we
[53:45] go revelation 10 1 the one that was
[53:48] clothed with a cloud rainbow was upon
[53:51] his head and we understand that was
[53:52] fulfilled and
[53:54] and and there had to be a prophet on on
[53:56] the scene brother braham said in the
[53:58] seals there had to be a prophet on the
[54:00] scene revelation 10 7 had to be there
[54:02] for revelation 10 1 to take place
[54:04] and so then we we get that and and um i
[54:08] i said to the church the other day i
[54:10] said don't ever ever be afraid of the
[54:13] book of revelation
[54:14] the book of revelation is the bride's
[54:16] book
[54:17] and the whole world looks at it and they
[54:20] ponder it and they wonder they're afraid
[54:22] of it but we're not afraid of it we love
[54:24] it
[54:25] because it's our book
[54:28] and now i want you to take a look at
[54:29] verse six
[54:31] and he swear by him that liveth forever
[54:35] and ever who created heavens and the
[54:38] things that are therein are and the
[54:40] earth and the things that therein are
[54:44] and the sea
[54:46] and the things which are therein that
[54:49] there should be time
[54:53] no longer so now in this scripture
[54:57] in between revelation 10 1
[55:00] and revelation 10 7 it doesn't take a
[55:03] rocket science to figure out that this
[55:05] scripture is between the two
[55:10] so a lot of people think that time is
[55:12] going to keep on going on
[55:14] and they live as though time is going to
[55:18] go on but brother brown said he said our
[55:20] mission in life is to find the last one
[55:23] and when the last one takes place
[55:26] because of revelation 10 1 and
[55:28] revelation 10 7 we revelation 10 8
[55:32] understand what this book and the
[55:34] purpose we have is all about
[55:38] is that fair to say
[55:39] that that with that went down real easy
[55:41] that that's just wonderful thank you so
[55:44] then i'd like to to
[55:47] you know a real real deep title for you
[55:49] i got a real deep title for it tonight i
[55:51] got it

[56:03] crazy when you ask something like that
[56:05] that some people don't is that a trick
[56:07] question

[59:56] man
[59:57] barely making it man
[1:00:00] where did that come from
[1:00:02] that came from laodicea that did not
[1:00:05] come from thus saith the word
[1:00:08] listen we got to know who we are
[1:00:10] in christ and i want you to say tonight
[1:00:13] by the time we finish i got it
[1:00:16] i got that which is perfect discount i
[1:00:19] got that word and it's alive in me
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:23] hey
[1:00:24] many many men
[1:00:27] yes sir so we got the mighty angel
[1:00:30] i got it
[1:00:32] huh
[1:00:33] i got it
[1:00:34] you say i know revelation 10 7. you say
[1:00:37] well that's brother brown
[1:00:39] is that true
[1:00:40] of course it is but now we're moving to
[1:00:42] revelation 10 8 and then it gets a
[1:00:44] little quieter no no it should get a
[1:00:46] little higher
[1:00:48] should get a little higher because the
[1:00:50] book came down to a prophet but didn't
[1:00:53] stay in his hand
[1:00:55] he passed it to you
[1:00:57] and when he passed it to you he passed
[1:01:00] the word
[1:01:02] and the word is christ
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:06] hallelujah
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:10] so now you say well i got the book now
[1:01:12] what are you gonna do with the book hold
[1:01:14] the book are you gonna eat the book
[1:01:16] i think you're gonna eat the book aren't
[1:01:17] you that's what my bible says
[1:01:20] eat the book
[1:01:22] i'm passionate
[1:01:26] come on if you're going to eat the word
[1:01:28] you might as well be passionate about it
[1:01:29] come to church you might as well be
[1:01:31] passionate about it
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:36] passionate people think we're crazy let
[1:01:38] us be crazy
[1:01:40] in a way they call heresy so worship i
[1:01:42] the god of my fathers
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:48] glory be to jesus
[1:01:50] brother brahman says here lifting him up
[1:01:52] out of history
[1:01:54] he said we're standing tonight on the
[1:01:56] brim
[1:01:57] watching come to pass and unfold
[1:02:00] the great scenes
[1:02:02] these two great scenes
[1:02:06] and these are one of them
[1:02:09] is the ending of history time shall be
[1:02:12] no more
[1:02:14] he delayeth no longer
[1:02:17] so now he's saying one of the two scenes
[1:02:19] has taken place
[1:02:20] history the ending of history
[1:02:23] and the other is the ending
[1:02:26] of time
[1:02:30] the ending of time
[1:02:32] many great men down
[1:02:34] through the ages have longed to see this
[1:02:37] hour
[1:02:39] that we are in now
[1:02:42] as we live in this glorious scene
[1:02:47] it's a setting of mortal sun
[1:02:50] and the breaking of eternal light
[1:02:56] i do feel
[1:02:58] that we are living in one of the
[1:02:59] grandest ages
[1:03:02] that man has ever been permitted to live
[1:03:08] now let me tell you something saints the
[1:03:10] quotes that i quote tonight are not the
[1:03:13] quotes of just william branham
[1:03:16] because we're going to get into this
[1:03:18] he was just a veil
[1:03:21] that god stepped into
[1:03:24] and spoke to you
[1:03:26] the elected lady
[1:03:29] so these aren't the words of man
[1:03:31] this is the thought of god concerning
[1:03:34] you we're at two great events the ending
[1:03:37] of history and the ending of time
[1:03:41] and so now then we must be blending into
[1:03:44] eternity
[1:03:46] okay you got that we're blending into
[1:03:48] eternity we're living in one of the
[1:03:50] grandest ages that man has ever
[1:03:52] permitted to live think about it think
[1:03:55] about it you know the devil has beat us
[1:03:57] down so bad
[1:03:58] you know who more me my me
[1:04:01] you know look at my problems and all
[1:04:03] that and god is telling you you're
[1:04:05] living in the grandest time that man has
[1:04:07] ever seen
[1:04:10] but my car's breaking down who's isn't
[1:04:16] man the bearing went out
[1:04:18] so what i was driving the other day hit
[1:04:20] a pothole my wheel fell off
[1:04:23] i said what's with that and i'm not a
[1:04:25] mccarrick
[1:04:26] so i stand out of the car and everybody
[1:04:27] thinks anybody gets out of a car once
[1:04:29] your car is broken down that you think
[1:04:30] you know what you're doing
[1:04:33] right and a guy comes running up to me
[1:04:35] ken he says uh can i help you in what
[1:04:38] you're doing i said i'm not doing
[1:04:39] nothing
[1:04:40] i'm just looking at a broken tire
[1:04:45] i mean it's crazy
[1:04:47] but you know who doesn't have a problem
[1:04:50] right and so then we get into the
[1:04:52] problem party my problem bigger than
[1:04:55] your problem
[1:04:57] come on
[1:04:59] okay let's just erase all the problems
[1:05:02] because he'll take care of every one of
[1:05:03] them
[1:05:04] if we let him
[1:05:07] the problem of it is we think we can
[1:05:09] correct our problem
[1:05:11] we just need to step back and say lord
[1:05:13] help me through this problem
[1:05:16] amen we are the most grandest time
[1:05:19] that man has ever seen
[1:05:23] yes sir
[1:05:25] he says we're living in the grandest age
[1:05:28] that's ever been
[1:05:30] permitted to live
[1:05:33] because it's the closing of time and the
[1:05:36] blending in of eternity history only
[1:05:38] tells us what we have read and what
[1:05:41] we've been
[1:05:42] and what's in the future lays is in the
[1:05:45] hand of god
[1:05:47] and we find out today there's not too
[1:05:50] much history being written because i
[1:05:53] don't think it'll ever be used
[1:05:57] so now brother branham is setting a
[1:05:59] platform can you turn with me please to
[1:06:01] genesis 1.
[1:06:06] genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
[1:06:18] i i you could quote it i know it yeah
[1:06:21] yeah
[1:06:22] let's read it together listen let's read
[1:06:24] it together as a class all right
[1:06:26] say in the beginning
[1:06:28] god created the heaven and the earth
[1:06:31] period
[1:06:34] i agree
[1:06:35] i was flying i was flying overseas i was
[1:06:37] going to europe and i was sitting in
[1:06:40] my seat looking out the window i said
[1:06:42] man i'm flying at 36 000 feet you know
[1:06:44] that's pretty cool i'm looking down at
[1:06:46] greenland and not much in greenland
[1:06:49] don't ever go there for tourism i don't
[1:06:50] think
[1:06:51] so
[1:06:52] a lot of ice when i was there and or
[1:06:54] flying over i should say
[1:06:56] and i'm looking at things like god
[1:06:58] you're great you're so great wonderful
[1:07:00] you're so wonderful and the fellow
[1:07:02] beside me goes what are you saying who
[1:07:04] are you talking to
[1:07:06] [Laughter]
[1:07:09] and i said
[1:07:11] myself
[1:07:13] you know that sounds weird to the world
[1:07:15] that really sounds weird i said actually
[1:07:18] i was just i was thinking about god
[1:07:20] oh wow
[1:07:21] that's really something i said well i
[1:07:23] said we're at 36 000 feet
[1:07:26] i said and there's a future home waiting
[1:07:27] for us at 15
[1:07:29] hundred miles i said we're flying at
[1:07:31] five miles i said i'm not even not past
[1:07:33] the base
[1:07:36] they start looking at you like
[1:07:40] i mean you're way too deep for me man
[1:07:43] he says okay okay okay let's let's get
[1:07:45] down to the business you know the you
[1:07:47] guys say that you know god created the
[1:07:48] heavens and earth and in seven days and
[1:07:51] all these animals and where's the
[1:07:52] dinosaurs go i go wait
[1:07:55] i'm just looking out the window
[1:07:58] you know sometimes when you got a
[1:08:00] 10-hour flight you want to have some
[1:08:01] quiet time
[1:08:03] i said well
[1:08:05] i said let me let's let me he says you
[1:08:07] know you christians you always say that
[1:08:08] the earth is you know only you know so
[1:08:10] and god did it in seven days i said oh
[1:08:12] really really is that is that what we we
[1:08:14] believe well he says that's what i think
[1:08:16] you believe well that's better
[1:08:18] i said you're not thinking
[1:08:22] and he get and he turns to me says well
[1:08:24] sir he says listen he says what do you
[1:08:26] say well peter says you know that a day
[1:08:29] is in the lord says a thousand years and
[1:08:30] there's seven thousand years in creation
[1:08:33] i said but
[1:08:34] that was in the creation of the earth
[1:08:37] the earth could have been here for
[1:08:41] billions of years
[1:08:42] he says you actually believe that well i
[1:08:44] said i happen to have a bible
[1:08:48] we read genesis 1 together
[1:08:51] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:08:54] and earth period
[1:08:56] he said i never thought of that before
[1:09:00] and so we take so much for granted
[1:09:03] the things that a prophet drops down or
[1:09:05] god drops down for us
[1:09:08] it's for us saints of god to have a
[1:09:10] peace and realize our god is a great god
[1:09:14] he is a very great god so let's take
[1:09:18] this now in the beginning
[1:09:22] brother braham said in christ identified
[1:09:23] in this
[1:09:24] the same in all generations 1964 he says
[1:09:28] now
[1:09:29] in the beginning
[1:09:32] that is when time started
[1:09:37] okay time started at a point
[1:09:40] because god is eternal
[1:09:43] so as soon as the bible says in the
[1:09:46] beginning
[1:09:48] that is when time
[1:09:50] started
[1:09:52] okay this is what your prophet is saying
[1:09:54] in the beginning that's when time
[1:09:57] started when eternity broke down
[1:10:01] into time
[1:10:04] this is amazing
[1:10:06] can you imagine eternal god
[1:10:08] and so now time dropped down
[1:10:11] now he goes on to say this he says now
[1:10:14] after a while
[1:10:15] time comes back to eternity
[1:10:19] so imagine if i had like a balloon or a
[1:10:21] round circle
[1:10:23] and i just cut out the top and like this
[1:10:26] in this big circle
[1:10:28] so in this timeline
[1:10:30] in the beginning
[1:10:32] so we got the old testament new
[1:10:33] testament calvary seven ages
[1:10:36] and the end of time
[1:10:38] and that's what we're speaking now we're
[1:10:39] coming to the
[1:10:41] end of time come to the end here
[1:10:45] so now
[1:10:46] eternity broke down into time now after
[1:10:49] a while time comes back to eternity
[1:10:54] glory
[1:10:57] time comes down
[1:10:58] back into turn course
[1:11:00] time is eternity too
[1:11:06] yeah
[1:11:07] this is a little getting into math
[1:11:14] glory
[1:11:16] i can quit preaching i'm going home
[1:11:23] that's it
[1:11:24] that's it we're at the end of time
[1:11:27] we've come time from eternity into time
[1:11:30] remember the quote kinsman redeemer use
[1:11:33] it at weddings remember
[1:11:35] she loves him
[1:11:36] he loves her
[1:11:38] they don't know why they stepped out of
[1:11:41] eternity
[1:11:42] into time and they will step back
[1:11:45] to eternity together
[1:11:48] that's the window he was giving you and
[1:11:51] i
[1:11:52] we might be in time but we're breaking
[1:11:54] back into eternity
[1:11:57] we're eternal beings
[1:12:02] if you were ever in the thought of god
[1:12:04] you're eternal
[1:12:06] that's what he said he said because god
[1:12:08] can never have a new thought you always
[1:12:11] were now you're a manifestation of the
[1:12:14] thought of god being fulfilled in your
[1:12:16] age
[1:12:17] so god saved you for the special age
[1:12:21] the end of time age bride age
[1:12:24] the breaking into eternity age
[1:12:27] oh brother sister
[1:12:30] we should be shouting dancing up and
[1:12:32] down we should be thanking god
[1:12:35] you say well i got a mortgage i got a
[1:12:37] payment and i got this you got nothing
[1:12:43] we got this
[1:12:45] i got it
[1:12:49] once you realize where you come from
[1:12:51] you're gonna go to the same place where
[1:12:53] you came from
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:58] so now this great chain
[1:13:01] of perfection
[1:13:03] eternity
[1:13:05] this great chain
[1:13:07] of perfection was broken in time space
[1:13:12] time came because of sin
[1:13:15] the fall of man that's when time began
[1:13:20] in the beginning
[1:13:22] so now
[1:13:24] time came because of sin let's draw a
[1:13:26] picture of that time so he drives
[1:13:28] brother ram dallas is a perfect circle
[1:13:31] it goes on forever and ever and ever
[1:13:34] and then all of them once sin dropped in
[1:13:37] and put a line
[1:13:40] as my wife calls it a little drop in the
[1:13:42] chain
[1:13:43] so the chain was around now it came like
[1:13:45] this we got that space of time
[1:13:48] in this chain
[1:13:50] it comes down now but eternity continues
[1:13:54] eternity continues
[1:13:56] god's eternal
[1:13:58] eternity can it just keeps on going
[1:14:00] but we're in this space called time but
[1:14:03] it's not his perfect condition it's not
[1:14:06] god's perfect condition
[1:14:09] here's a little gap come down broke over
[1:14:12] this way goes out that way god had to do
[1:14:14] that because satan caused it
[1:14:17] it dropped down to a space of time for
[1:14:21] the trying
[1:14:23] and perfecting and for the purging
[1:14:26] of the lost
[1:14:28] that god by his sovereign grace might
[1:14:31] someday lift that gap back up
[1:14:34] into a perfect circle and then shall
[1:14:37] roll on and on and on
[1:14:41] so god's dealing with us in this space
[1:14:44] called time
[1:14:49] so in this space of time he starts
[1:14:52] revealing himself
[1:14:53] he revealed himself to abraham as
[1:14:55] jehovah jireh jehovah
[1:14:58] tiscanu
[1:15:00] revealed himself as melchizedek god
[1:15:02] keeps on revealing himself
[1:15:04] through this space of time and here
[1:15:06] we're at the end of time knowing all
[1:15:09] about god's unveiling and that's why he
[1:15:11] called it the mighty god unveiled before
[1:15:13] us because he was showing us where god
[1:15:15] was all through the ages
[1:15:18] so there's anything god was a prophet is
[1:15:21] showing you past present and future come
[1:15:24] on you stay with me because he already
[1:15:26] saw you in glory
[1:15:29] he already saw you over there
[1:15:31] he says don't say i'm gonna make it he
[1:15:33] said you've already made it i saw you
[1:15:36] there where were you prophet i was in
[1:15:39] eternity
[1:15:42] glory he lived between those two realms
[1:15:47] that's your prophet that's my prophet
[1:15:50] that's what we believe brother ray this
[1:15:51] is what we believe so now time came down
[1:15:54] at the end of time he was going to have
[1:15:56] a prophet come in this generation to
[1:15:59] literally
[1:16:00] turn your hearts
[1:16:02] back to the faith of our fathers
[1:16:05] amen so that faith
[1:16:08] in us gets so strong
[1:16:11] he says in the holy ghost series that we
[1:16:13] lift
[1:16:15] raise up
[1:16:16] and the resurrection takes place
[1:16:19] he said you're already resurrected come
[1:16:21] on you're already resurrected he said
[1:16:24] all you're waiting for is your body to
[1:16:25] catch up to what's already happening
[1:16:29] hallelujah
[1:16:32] praise the lord got it
[1:16:35] that's all you have to say i got it i
[1:16:37] didn't learn it i got it i got the
[1:16:39] principle i got it
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:45] if i'm too loud to you forgive me
[1:16:48] i'm passionate
[1:16:51] we're passionate
[1:16:54] he's the author
[1:16:56] he's the beginner
[1:16:58] he is the creation of god time
[1:17:01] time is a little loop it loops down
[1:17:04] jesus
[1:17:06] was from eternity
[1:17:08] to eternity
[1:17:10] oh i love that expression how the
[1:17:11] prophet does that
[1:17:13] jesus
[1:17:14] was eternity to eternity
[1:17:18] you know that's like
[1:17:23] but he stepped into time space
[1:17:27] and was made flesh
[1:17:30] and came here in order
[1:17:33] to sanctify
[1:17:36] come on you stay with me now saying
[1:17:38] please
[1:17:39] once sanctified you're sanctified
[1:17:42] once justified you're justified
[1:17:45] once filled with god you're filled with
[1:17:46] god
[1:17:47] he can't unfill you he can't unsanctify
[1:17:50] you he can't unjustify you he calls you
[1:17:52] the perfect sinless spotless bride of
[1:17:56] jesus christ that's his thought
[1:18:00] i got it
[1:18:02] it's not a quote i got it
[1:18:09] i got it
[1:18:11] hallelujah
[1:18:13] he stepped into time
[1:18:15] to sanctify
[1:18:17] to put a streak of blood
[1:18:19] all across that place
[1:18:23] to redeem it and connect it back to god
[1:18:26] again
[1:18:29] oh my we could have a shouting vote
[1:18:31] right now this is better than any home
[1:18:34] run
[1:18:37] it's better than every base loaded and
[1:18:40] hitting a home run
[1:18:42] and the crowd goes crazy
[1:18:44] saints this to me is where people should
[1:18:47] be going crazy
[1:18:48] i've come from eternity i'm going back
[1:18:51] to eternity he saw you in eternity
[1:18:55] he said they took me and said brother
[1:18:57] brown brother branham's here brother
[1:18:59] brown hey we're tangible
[1:19:02] we're tangible
[1:19:04] there'll be tall ones short ones brother
[1:19:07] wayne and me
[1:19:10] i think we'll be a little slender
[1:19:13] hopefully did he say hopefully
[1:19:17] hopefully huh
[1:19:19] brother brown said there'll be red
[1:19:21] hair what no why no he's white i'm not
[1:19:24] white i'm blonde
[1:19:27] i hate to tell you you're looking at a
[1:19:29] blonde man here
[1:19:34] i might as well prophesy
[1:19:36] huh we might as well
[1:19:38] we might as well tell you know my
[1:19:40] brethren said the high priest can't even
[1:19:42] move
[1:19:43] until you first confess it
[1:19:45] i might you might as well say hey i got
[1:19:47] a new body

[1:19:54] say
[1:19:54] brother robert has a need he's healed
[1:19:58] we might as well say it
[1:20:00] because that's what we are
[1:20:02] this is what we are saints
[1:20:05] so he came in order to sanctify us to
[1:20:08] put a streak of blood across the place
[1:20:10] to redeem it and connect it back to god
[1:20:13] again for all eternity do you see it got
[1:20:15] it
[1:20:16] that's all time
[1:20:18] jesus christ was a lamb slain before the
[1:20:22] foundation
[1:20:24] of the world
[1:20:27] how many believe that you're the bride
[1:20:29] of jesus christ
[1:20:31] ah okay so we are a bride and i'm not
[1:20:33] gonna i'm not looking at anybody when i
[1:20:35] say this
[1:20:37] because if we are the bride we're not
[1:20:39] children
[1:20:43] god marries
[1:20:45] bride
[1:20:47] right
[1:20:48] so now you have a message called why
[1:20:51] cry
[1:20:53] spake
[1:20:54] come on okay i'll look all over here and
[1:20:56] not look at anybody over here
[1:20:59] so now he he makes an announcement to us
[1:21:03] he said samson didn't even have to pray
[1:21:05] anymore
[1:21:06] he was anointed
[1:21:08] come on come on we're anointed we are
[1:21:11] already under an unction
[1:21:13] we are anointed to any devil that comes
[1:21:16] by our way he said he didn't have to
[1:21:18] have a prayer meeting he knew who he was
[1:21:20] and when that devil came he killed those
[1:21:23] devils
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:26] he killed him
[1:21:29] he says then
[1:21:30] why are you crying
[1:21:33] now look over here
[1:21:35] so why are you crying
[1:21:38] he says
[1:21:40] when any little thing comes up
[1:21:43] why do you act like a baby
[1:21:47] okay i'll look over here
[1:21:49] i'll look at the very back
[1:21:52] but i didn't say this
[1:21:54] prophet huh
[1:21:57] revelation 10 7
[1:21:59] but who was speaking through revelation
[1:22:01] 10 7.
[1:22:02] revelation 10 1.
[1:22:04] and what is he doing he's telling the
[1:22:06] bride to eat the book
[1:22:08] hey so he says why be babies no more
[1:22:11] nah don't cry speak it
[1:22:14] we're breaking into eternity we're going
[1:22:17] into a rapture we're going into a body
[1:22:19] change
[1:22:20] we can't be a bunch of babies over every
[1:22:22] situation
[1:22:25] brother erickson there won't be any
[1:22:27] phone calls in next month
[1:22:31] you just say didn't you hear what
[1:22:32] brother tom said
[1:22:36] actually it's page 39 why can't i speak
[1:22:39] if anybody wants to put it down
[1:22:42] is it okay
[1:22:44] everybody all right
[1:22:46] he says you know when any little thing
[1:22:47] comes up you act like a baby you ought
[1:22:50] to be a man
[1:22:53] and then this is where we're coming to
[1:22:56] when that which is perfect is come
[1:22:58] that which was in part is done away
[1:23:01] because when i was a child i spake

[1:24:43] hallelujah
[1:24:45] listen
[1:24:46] brother brahman says in one place i've
[1:24:48] got the quote here he said we're living
[1:24:50] on
[1:24:50] ball road time
[1:24:53] we're waiting for the last one so it's
[1:24:54] borrowed time
[1:24:58] anybody
[1:25:00] let me praise this question
[1:25:04] you hear the news
[1:25:07] you know it's depressing
[1:25:09] so my suggestion to you don't hear the
[1:25:12] news
[1:25:15] you got 1100 tapes
[1:25:17] huh that's the good news
[1:25:21] that is the good news
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:27] that is the good news we need to be in
[1:25:30] because brother ram said the next war
[1:25:33] you know this is it's almost comical
[1:25:36] you see the chinese and the chinese have
[1:25:37] this humongous
[1:25:39] army
[1:25:40] you see the march
[1:25:44] and they're all looking the same way
[1:25:47] it doesn't matter what country
[1:25:49] it doesn't matter what country and they
[1:25:51] show the power of these men
[1:25:53] you know what brother braham said
[1:25:55] he said
[1:25:57] he said the next war that takes place
[1:25:59] will only be three minutes
[1:26:04] you know that's why he called him atomic
[1:26:06] fodder now you start to understand some
[1:26:09] of the expressions now
[1:26:11] why would he call the nation atomic
[1:26:13] fodder well because they got a bomb now
[1:26:16] have you read i don't know whether
[1:26:17] you've studied it out but they have a
[1:26:19] bomb now
[1:26:21] that is 670
[1:26:24] 000
[1:26:25] times bigger than hiroshima
[1:26:30] they said when it drops the continent is
[1:26:33] annihilated
[1:26:37] oh my loving brother
[1:26:40] when the world's on fire
[1:26:42] don't you want god's bosom oh
[1:26:45] to be your pillow
[1:26:47] hide me over in the rock of ages
[1:26:50] there's not going to be any guy with you
[1:26:52] know i've got the i got bullets now that
[1:26:54] go around corners
[1:26:56] and all of a sudden you see this rocket
[1:26:57] coming at you
[1:26:59] like big deal
[1:27:01] what's that rifle going to do you
[1:27:03] nothing
[1:27:07] so they put all their stock
[1:27:09] into their development of warfare
[1:27:11] the prophet saw america in ashes that
[1:27:14] house means to be america happens to be
[1:27:16] canada too
[1:27:18] oh we live in canada like at the 49th
[1:27:20] parallel nothing comes over like the
[1:27:22] virus
[1:27:28] this is crazy stuff and they actually
[1:27:30] believe it but i don't
[1:27:33] i don't because before you know let me
[1:27:35] just say this it was quite clinical
[1:27:37] because because everybody was you know
[1:27:39] thinking that when when all these
[1:27:41] borders were being broke loose and
[1:27:44] and atomic bombs were landing in or
[1:27:47] cases were landing in the hands of rogue
[1:27:49] countries and brother graham said it'll
[1:27:50] be just one little country that you know
[1:27:53] drank too much and push a button
[1:27:55] and so anyways you know we had a flurry
[1:27:57] of that a few years back and one of our
[1:27:59] brothers and
[1:28:00] was eating his lunch bucket and i i
[1:28:03] wasn't eating his lunch bucket he was
[1:28:05] eating out of his lunch bucket
[1:28:07] and um
[1:28:09] when he was eating of course you know a
[1:28:12] believer is at one end of the table and
[1:28:14] all the cronies are on the other end and
[1:28:16] we all know about that and so he's
[1:28:18] quietly eating his lunch and
[1:28:20] they said man the bunk could fall any
[1:28:21] time man aren't you worried about it and
[1:28:24] all the guys going yeah man what are we
[1:28:25] gonna do let's get into the mountains
[1:28:27] like the mountain's going to help you
[1:28:31] so
[1:28:32] the brother at the end of the table they
[1:28:34] said well aren't you worried he said not
[1:28:36] at all
[1:28:40] he says why aren't you worried my
[1:28:41] prophet
[1:28:43] said
[1:28:45] before one bomb falls
[1:28:48] he said i'm going in a rapture
[1:28:51] that was the quietest lunchroom you ever
[1:28:54] saw but i got it
[1:28:59] we got it
[1:29:04] for old time he says we're living on
[1:29:07] borrowed
[1:29:08] time
[1:29:09] no wonder brother bram said it's three
[1:29:11] minutes to midnight so i just happened
[1:29:13] to study that out hey three minutes i
[1:29:16] wonder how it's ticked since the prophet
[1:29:18] left
[1:29:19] he said you got 100 seconds
[1:29:24] got you 100 seconds
[1:29:26] that just warms your heart when you get
[1:29:27] up in the morning hi honey we got 100
[1:29:30] seconds left
[1:29:33] huh and the bride she gets up in the
[1:29:35] morning says glory be to jesus
[1:29:38] what a difference
[1:29:40] huh
[1:29:41] what a difference
[1:29:43] yes sir
[1:29:45] so here we are living on borrowed time
[1:29:48] so god in his grace and love and mercy
[1:29:51] in the space of time is unveiling
[1:29:53] himself because he can't he can't reveal
[1:29:56] himself as the great unknown god the
[1:29:58] great god that fills all space and time
[1:30:00] brother braham said in christ the
[1:30:02] mystery god revealed he said he's too
[1:30:04] great for that to ever be revealed to
[1:30:07] people too mysterious for that
[1:30:10] he said
[1:30:11] he's such a great being that never did
[1:30:13] begin
[1:30:14] but after you went beyond the cycle of a
[1:30:16] hundred of billions of trillions and
[1:30:18] trillions of years of light space
[1:30:22] and we're talking about a grade 7
[1:30:23] education
[1:30:25] that's god speaking to us man
[1:30:28] on into the infinite in infant
[1:30:31] infinity and eternity and a great
[1:30:34] creature that was all that time but he
[1:30:38] loved
[1:30:40] fatherhood
[1:30:42] so in this great god
[1:30:44] he loved fatherhood
[1:30:46] and in loving fatherhood he says because
[1:30:49] he he wanted to be a father the only way
[1:30:51] he could do that was to become the son
[1:30:55] of man
[1:30:58] the son of man and that's the reason
[1:31:00] jesus kept saying the son of man the son
[1:31:02] of man why it was god immorphy
[1:31:07] god changing his mask oh i love this can
[1:31:10] you stay with me on this for a little
[1:31:11] bit are we doing all right for time
[1:31:14] okay
[1:31:15] so here's a morphe your god comes down
[1:31:17] in a body of flesh
[1:31:19] and morphy
[1:31:20] so now he came to abraham's tent true
[1:31:23] and and abraham said lord
[1:31:26] but man said that was elohim
[1:31:28] right you didn't even see the other two
[1:31:30] he just saw elohim it was god
[1:31:33] unveiling himself in morphy so then
[1:31:36] gideon meets him under a tree
[1:31:38] in morphy
[1:31:39] you always have to have a prophet
[1:31:43] for god to change his mask
[1:31:47] god always abraham prophet had to see
[1:31:50] elohim god can never show himself until
[1:31:52] there's a prophet showing you in morphy
[1:31:55] so when jesus came john the baptist had
[1:31:58] to be here
[1:31:59] come on stay with me so john the baptist
[1:32:01] said behold the lamb of god they're
[1:32:03] taking away the sins of the world is
[1:32:05] that right because now prophet has to
[1:32:07] introduce a morphe god in flesh
[1:32:10] then here comes paul the pillar of fire
[1:32:13] and it had to be paul prophet to say
[1:32:15] that's jesus come on stay with me so
[1:32:18] then when william branham was here the
[1:32:20] pillar of fire came back there had to be
[1:32:22] a prophet to let us know that revelation
[1:32:25] 10 1 has come
[1:32:28] i got it
[1:32:31] because whenever god changes his mass
[1:32:33] there always has to be a prophet
[1:32:35] because god can do nothing amos says
[1:32:38] until first he reveals it to his
[1:32:39] servants the prophet
[1:32:41] first says that right so we've got to
[1:32:43] say with the bible
[1:32:45] but if you look it up in the greek if
[1:32:47] you want to do some studying it'll tell
[1:32:49] you that
[1:32:50] that god can never
[1:32:51] unveil himself without a prophet i
[1:32:54] thought it was beautiful
[1:32:55] i love that
[1:32:57] oh my then god changed his mask one more
[1:32:59] time
[1:33:03] amen i no longer call you church
[1:33:06] come on i no longer call you church i
[1:33:09] call you bride
[1:33:11] it took a prophet to let you know god is
[1:33:15] in you
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:23] yes sir bone of his bone that's what he
[1:33:25] kept on saying now to the end of his
[1:33:26] ministry your bones with bones spirit of
[1:33:28] the spirit flesh is fast life is with
[1:33:31] his life i can't speak fast enough
[1:33:34] i'm not like these young fellas that can
[1:33:36] speak like
[1:33:38] but isn't that marvelous
[1:33:42] my girls what a privileged people
[1:33:45] you are
[1:33:46] i would have loved
[1:33:48] to been like these young men to hear
[1:33:49] what i'm hearing
[1:33:51] i never heard nothing until i was 21.
[1:33:54] never heard nothing i didn't know where
[1:33:56] john 3 16 was
[1:33:58] didn't have a clue
[1:33:59] you know he ever come to church
[1:34:01] and and the minister says will you turn
[1:34:03] to habakkuk
[1:34:07] everybody's going habakkuk
[1:34:09] and you don't want the neighbor to know
[1:34:10] where you're looking in the table of
[1:34:12] contents
[1:34:15] you don't
[1:34:17] so you know here i am i'm just new i
[1:34:20] don't know nothing i don't know where
[1:34:21] john is i could have been looking in
[1:34:23] genesis for all i know so i go to the
[1:34:25] table condos my ears are burning
[1:34:28] of course there's only 15 people in
[1:34:29] church at that
[1:34:30] time but you're just a little
[1:34:32] embarrassed because you didn't know
[1:34:33] anything
[1:34:35] and yet here are these young men
[1:34:39] that can take the wisdom that they've
[1:34:41] already received now
[1:34:43] and confused that's why jesus being the
[1:34:46] word
[1:34:47] could confuse those pharisees at 12
[1:34:49] years of age
[1:34:54] hallelujah
[1:34:56] all the bible says in all that dwell
[1:34:59] upon the earth
[1:35:00] shall worship the beast
[1:35:03] but those names that were not written in
[1:35:06] the book of life will worship them but
[1:35:08] those whose names were written in the
[1:35:10] lamb's book of life from the foundation
[1:35:11] of the world
[1:35:12] she'll take a rapture
[1:35:15] that blood streak was abel's lamb
[1:35:17] that blood streak was
[1:35:19] was isaiah uh
[1:35:21] isaac's ram
[1:35:24] that blood streak
[1:35:26] was the token for israel that blood
[1:35:28] streak
[1:35:30] came to calvary that blood streak
[1:35:32] is that bleeding word that came in this
[1:35:34] generation
[1:35:35] and now the end of the chain has come
[1:35:38] and god's ready to pull
[1:35:40] the chain he's a
[1:35:43] abel's lamb isaac's ram children of
[1:35:45] israel's token lamb he was john the
[1:35:47] baptist there's a lamb of god he said
[1:35:50] eternity dropped down back into time
[1:35:53] through jesus christ
[1:35:55] so beloved jude says in jude three
[1:35:57] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[1:36:00] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:36:02] it's needful for me to write unto you
[1:36:05] and exhort
[1:36:07] you
[1:36:09] that you should earnestly
[1:36:14] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:36:16] was once delivered
[1:36:18] unto the saints can i give you another
[1:36:20] translation beloved well i'm making
[1:36:23] every effort to write
[1:36:24] about to you about the common salvation
[1:36:27] i'm compelled to write
[1:36:30] i'm urgently appealing
[1:36:32] that you fight strenuously
[1:36:35] for the defense of this faith
[1:36:39] and if jude could say it i can say it
[1:36:42] you can say it we earnestly contend and
[1:36:45] we'll fight for this revelation
[1:36:49] people might walk away from it and
[1:36:51] they've never had a revelation of it
[1:36:53] they can sit in your church for 10 years
[1:36:55] 20 years and you think they got what you
[1:36:57] got they ain't got nothing you got
[1:37:00] because once a revelation strikes your
[1:37:02] soul the gates of hell can never
[1:37:05] never
[1:37:06] never
[1:37:08] prevail against it
[1:37:10] what it shows
[1:37:11] that you can be sitting in church for 40
[1:37:14] years and never have one revelation but
[1:37:17] there's a group of people
[1:37:19] amen written in the lamb's book of life
[1:37:22] she is revelated revelated revelated
[1:37:24] revelated
[1:37:28] that's why people fall asleep in church
[1:37:34] you catch me fall asleep you just say
[1:37:36] tell him i ain't got it
[1:37:41] really wrong
[1:37:43] really brother ray
[1:37:45] i've heard that
[1:37:48] my my
[1:37:50] he didn't get it
[1:37:54] he didn't get it
[1:37:56] sorry
[1:37:57] can i start then at the beginning
[1:38:00] you must be born again you must be born
[1:38:03] again
[1:38:04] because without the new birth you can't
[1:38:07] see the kingdom of god
[1:38:10] we try and give everybody we witness to
[1:38:12] everybody we want to tell them about
[1:38:13] prophet we want to tell them what god's
[1:38:14] done we give them serpentine we give
[1:38:16] them everything they got to get them
[1:38:18] born again first
[1:38:21] all they're learning is knowledge
[1:38:24] oh that you know how many people say
[1:38:25] well that sounds right
[1:38:29] really
[1:38:30] man when when i was i'm not saved
[1:38:33] and brother ken gave me serpenty
[1:38:35] man every light came on in the house
[1:38:40] he said do you mean i could be
[1:38:42] serpentine
[1:38:43] and not god's seed
[1:38:45] you mean that's why i have to be born
[1:38:47] again
[1:38:49] of the incre incorruptible seed of god
[1:38:52] and you know what he did on me he walked
[1:38:54] out of the room
[1:38:55] i said where are you going he says you
[1:38:56] figure it out
[1:39:00] i said
[1:39:02] i went through the school of hard knocks
[1:39:05] but i figured it out
[1:39:07] one day at an altar
[1:39:09] i said jesus i surrender all all to
[1:39:12] jesus i surrender and when i surrendered
[1:39:16] he took the dope he took the drugs he
[1:39:18] took the drinking he took the cigarette
[1:39:21] he took everything in a moment
[1:39:28] and i've never been the same
[1:39:30] they say you're a fanatic at 21 and
[1:39:33] you're a fanatic at 67. you watch me at
[1:39:36] 81.

[1:39:41] i'm stronger now than i was 40 years ago
[1:39:47] give me my mountain
[1:39:48] i don't care if there's giants
[1:39:52] sons of attic
[1:39:54] i do not care
[1:39:56] god said
[1:39:57] he gave me my mountain
[1:40:01] come on mountain perfection
[1:40:03] come with me
[1:40:04] come on let's start climbing from faith
[1:40:05] force you know come on keep climbing
[1:40:09] it's your mountain
[1:40:13] but let me help you on this
[1:40:15] because doctrines get flying i'm not
[1:40:17] here to preach talking
[1:40:19] come on
[1:40:20] but if you if you said add to your faith
[1:40:22] virtue add to your virtue knowledge
[1:40:25] when jesus said not not one man can add
[1:40:27] a cubit to his measure
[1:40:30] so tell me how you add
[1:40:32] let me tell you how do you add
[1:40:34] well i got faith well i got adverts you
[1:40:36] know no you can't do that
[1:40:39] that would be contrary to scripture but
[1:40:41] if you take a word
[1:40:43] ad
[1:40:44] and look it up it's epicorigo
[1:40:46] epicorigo means there is somebody that
[1:40:49] has wealth in you
[1:40:51] that is strong enough to pay your debt
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:40:56] glory and because it's faith
[1:40:58] you must lay in the presence of the sun
[1:41:04] listen you got a prophet that's a word
[1:41:06] prophet and they say well you're
[1:41:08] speaking greek
[1:41:09] he's preaching he's speaking the word
[1:41:12] and you just go in the word and you'll
[1:41:13] find it all through it
[1:41:15] and it's thrilling when you see it epic
[1:41:17] corgo somebody who has the wealth to pay
[1:41:20] all things
[1:41:22] and that the only way that you can add
[1:41:24] is to lay in the presence of the sun and
[1:41:27] that seed starts to grow
[1:41:30] hallelujah
[1:41:32] that's why he said it's the rising of
[1:41:34] the sun
[1:41:36] and the wave shape has been waved over
[1:41:38] you
[1:41:39] so the rest of the harvest is going to
[1:41:41] be like this wave
[1:41:44] sheep you've been waved over i'm sorry

[1:44:36] brother brahman said oh wayward man
[1:44:39] wayward woman this morning
[1:44:41] when you're sitting here there's
[1:44:43] something in you
[1:44:45] telling you
[1:44:46] some hour that's gone by that hour is
[1:44:50] now
[1:44:52] there were thousands there
[1:44:54] that had obeying an hour past
[1:44:58] but there was a present tense
[1:45:01] hour that was the hour that jesus is to
[1:45:04] appear
[1:45:06] and there stood the word there stood the
[1:45:08] people there was the manifestation of
[1:45:11] god taking place it was being vindicated
[1:45:14] it was truth manifested but not all saw
[1:45:19] not all saw
[1:45:26] i'm so glad that in this day that we're
[1:45:28] now living in the gloom
[1:45:31] and the darkness on every hand
[1:45:34] there seems to be a blessed hope
[1:45:37] gripping
[1:45:38] the heart of god's people
[1:45:40] that some glorious hour
[1:45:43] jesus shall arrive
[1:45:45] and in this great time of trouble in
[1:45:48] this city
[1:45:49] young folks are ignoring it and many
[1:45:51] people who don't care about it
[1:45:54] but the watchmen still cries out
[1:45:57] they're in their taverns they're
[1:45:58] drinking they're partnering but they
[1:46:00] have been warned
[1:46:03] they have been worn in this space called
[1:46:06] time
[1:46:08] nothing was going to harm them then all
[1:46:12] of a sudden
[1:46:14] judgment strikes
[1:46:16] whether it be titus
[1:46:18] whether it be pearl harbor
[1:46:21] they've been warned in laodicea
[1:46:25] we've all been warned
[1:46:29] amen
[1:46:31] and now by the grace of god you can say
[1:46:35] by the time
[1:46:36] i got it
[1:46:39] they might not get it
[1:46:41] but i got it
[1:46:44] god dropped down from eternity go back
[1:46:46] into eternity come back down to collect
[1:46:49] us and we go back to him
[1:46:52] we go back to him
[1:46:55] do you believe that
[1:46:57] come on benjamin franklin
[1:47:01] anybody know benjamin franklin
[1:47:04] of course you take history
[1:47:08] do you know thomas edison
[1:47:10] so good yeah okay well there had to be a
[1:47:13] benjamin franklin before there was a
[1:47:15] thomas edison
[1:47:18] and each one of them brother branham
[1:47:20] refers to he says there was benjamin
[1:47:23] franklin he said something in him
[1:47:26] said there's electricity that now who
[1:47:28] told him that
[1:47:30] who told that little boy there's sulfur
[1:47:32] in that petal
[1:47:34] what did he do chew on the guitar first
[1:47:37] huh then on the chair
[1:47:39] and then on the bike pedal
[1:47:41] there was a deep brother brethren's head
[1:47:43] calling to the deep
[1:47:45] and that deep called for the sulfur that
[1:47:47] was in the pedal
[1:47:49] brother rem said because his body was
[1:47:51] out of the earth
[1:47:54] and because his body came out of the
[1:47:56] earth his earth was calling for sulfur
[1:47:58] come on i want you to stay with me there
[1:48:00] was another book
[1:48:01] called the lamb's book of life and we
[1:48:04] came out of that book our names were
[1:48:06] written in that book and because we're
[1:48:08] in that book your deep is calling for
[1:48:11] that book
[1:48:12] you didn't have to look at the baptist
[1:48:14] church the catholic church any other
[1:48:16] church but this message
[1:48:19] was what your heart was calling for
[1:48:21] malachi 4 came for you
[1:48:26] amen
[1:48:27] behold i send you who's the you
[1:48:30] i got it i got it
[1:48:32] amen i don't care if it's for anybody
[1:48:34] else but i know it was for me
[1:48:36] he sent elijah for me he sent brother
[1:48:38] biscuit from toronto to cloverdale for
[1:48:41] me
[1:48:46] put brother ray erickson here for you
[1:48:50] you might as well say amen and glorify
[1:48:52] god for it
[1:48:57] amen so it was god rich in mercy our
[1:49:00] deep calling out eternity calling for
[1:49:04] eternity
[1:49:05] i got it
[1:49:08] i come from a place called eternity
[1:49:12] and i'm going to a place called eternity
[1:49:15] and how
[1:49:17] the holy spirit was trying to tell the
[1:49:18] people throughout the years
[1:49:21] of this message
[1:49:22] that god was on the scene
[1:49:24] and they just wanted to know their
[1:49:26] address
[1:49:27] can you imagine that
[1:49:29] tell me my address please
[1:49:31] you know your address
[1:49:34] i hope you know your address
[1:49:37] do you know where you live
[1:49:40] and they just wanted to know that god
[1:49:42] knew where they lived really
[1:49:43] you want to put god telling you where he
[1:49:45] is but what god was doing is being
[1:49:48] graceful and merciful
[1:49:51] graceful and merciful
[1:49:53] graceful and merciful and so he's trying
[1:49:56] to break on the scene for the people in
[1:49:59] the first poll second poll now he's
[1:50:01] coming to the third pole
[1:50:04] and now just like jesus said unless you
[1:50:06] eat my flesh and drink my blood you have
[1:50:07] no part
[1:50:08] of me and the bible says 70 disciples
[1:50:11] left him the multitudes wondered even
[1:50:13] peter said
[1:50:17] what's going on here
[1:50:19] let's be honest
[1:50:20] if i said to you
[1:50:22] hey gabe eat my flesh will you and drink
[1:50:24] my blood or you have no part of me
[1:50:26] that's exactly what you do
[1:50:31] and peter said
[1:50:33] he said peter you're going to go too
[1:50:35] he said lord where can i go i know one
[1:50:38] thing for sure you've got the words of
[1:50:39] eternal life
[1:50:42] amen gabe you've got a great revelation
[1:50:44] there
[1:50:45] i got the words of eternal
[1:50:47] life
[1:50:49] he got it
[1:50:50] who do men say that i the son of man am
[1:50:52] though at the christ the son of the
[1:50:54] living god he got it
[1:50:56] nothing shook him he did did peter have
[1:50:58] a bad time
[1:51:01] deny the lord three times
[1:51:04] i would say he had a bad day
[1:51:06] even custom swore
[1:51:08] i'd say that's a bad day anybody had a
[1:51:10] bad day
[1:51:11] but you did not lose
[1:51:14] come on brother graham said we make
[1:51:16] mistakes all the time but the blood of
[1:51:18] jesus christ cleanses us from every sin
[1:51:24] glory to jesus
[1:51:26] that blood
[1:51:28] reaches down to the lowest valley
[1:51:31] so now here here's god breaking on the
[1:51:34] scene
[1:51:35] in the message called looking to the
[1:51:36] unseen you've heard it i'm sure many
[1:51:38] times brother brown said don't you love
[1:51:40] those pulsations of faith why don't you
[1:51:42] just come on down and keep your hands up
[1:51:45] and praising him and all of a sudden as
[1:51:48] he says as they come into the altar he
[1:51:50] said i am the lord that raised christ
[1:51:52] from the grave
[1:51:54] where'd that come from
[1:51:56] i am the lord that raised christ from
[1:51:58] the grave i am the one that sent the
[1:52:01] holy ghost i am the one that give the
[1:52:03] promise brother branham has nothing to
[1:52:05] do in this
[1:52:07] i he surrendered his life to me i'm
[1:52:10] using his spirit and i'm talking through
[1:52:12] his lips that's me i am the lord
[1:52:17] i say glory
[1:52:19] i got it
[1:52:23] god speaking through that vessel god
[1:52:26] speaking to his people
[1:52:28] god getting your people ready
[1:52:32] there is indeed a man here
[1:52:34] that can turn on the light don't fear
[1:52:35] little sister
[1:52:38] don't feel her fear little sister
[1:52:41] see this little girl standing there
[1:52:42] screaming the top of her voice
[1:52:44] going into high sterics
[1:52:48] so that's like the bride
[1:52:53] but you know what her little brother
[1:52:54] cried out
[1:52:57] little pride

[1:53:02] because he's standing right by
[1:53:06] he's the engineer

[1:53:11] not there
[1:53:13] here
[1:53:14] that can turn on the light
[1:53:17] when you got the revelation
[1:53:20] of this message
[1:53:22] your light went on
[1:53:23] and you can say i got it brother tom
[1:53:27] i got it why i've come from god i go
[1:53:29] back to god i came from eternity i go
[1:53:32] back to eternity
[1:53:35] i am an eternal
[1:53:37] being

[1:53:42] personal life of christ
[1:53:45] come on brother
[1:53:47] erickson was saying that at the very
[1:53:49] beginning of his service

[1:53:59] it's no longer i that live but christ

[1:54:34] a revelation he
[1:54:36] came
[1:54:37] to me
[1:54:39] the person
[1:54:41] of jesus

[1:55:00] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:55:02] light which is the person of jesus
[1:55:04] christ himself and when the messiah
[1:55:07] comes

[1:55:21] and he and upon this rock i'll build my
[1:55:24] church now
[1:55:25] you that have been predestinated unto
[1:55:27] this inheritance everybody say amen
[1:55:29] i am predestinated unto this grand
[1:55:32] inheritance
[1:55:34] if i
[1:55:36] am a right inheritance of something and
[1:55:38] if god is knocking at my heart saying
[1:55:40] william branham i called you a long time
[1:55:43] ago before the foundation of the world
[1:55:45] from eternity i called you a long time
[1:55:47] ago before the nation of the world to
[1:55:49] preach this gospel i have an inheritance
[1:55:51] an inheritance of eternal life
[1:55:54] now listen what the prophet said
[1:55:56] now god
[1:55:57] sent
[1:55:58] jesus to make that
[1:56:02] inheritance
[1:56:04] real
[1:56:05] to me
[1:56:08] come on
[1:56:09] put your name there i want you to put
[1:56:11] your name there then god from eternity
[1:56:15] sent this jesus
[1:56:17] to make your inheritance
[1:56:19] real to you
[1:56:23] real to me
[1:56:25] well here you go now i wish i had a lot
[1:56:29] of money but i don't have any
[1:56:32] so there you go
[1:56:33] but if i had a million bucks
[1:56:36] i would say
[1:56:37] hmm
[1:56:38] somebody in the back row would beat
[1:56:39] somebody here
[1:56:41] now i don't know
[1:56:42] i don't know i'm just holding a million
[1:56:44] dollars out right
[1:56:46] it's a winning ticket
[1:56:48] not one of you be sitting in your seat
[1:56:52] brian would be scrambling over about
[1:56:54] four rows because he's so tall and
[1:56:56] long-legged
[1:56:58] you'd do anything i said it's free for
[1:57:00] anybody
[1:57:01] it's free for anybody and yet the gospel
[1:57:03] is free for anybody
[1:57:05] and we got more than a million bucks we
[1:57:07] got a city
[1:57:09] made of pure gold
[1:57:11] huh we'll live for eternity forever and
[1:57:13] ever but god sent this message which is
[1:57:17] christ
[1:57:18] to make this inheritance
[1:57:20] real to you
[1:57:22] so you can say i got that brother tom
[1:57:25] jesus came to me
[1:57:27] and made this message real to me
[1:57:30] because brother i'm saying i took his
[1:57:31] message this message it's christ
[1:57:37] it's not just a message another church
[1:57:40] this message is christ
[1:57:44] can you put up with five more minutes
[1:57:48] behold
[1:57:50] i send you a mystery
[1:57:53] we shall not all sleep
[1:57:58] tom you're preaching way too long right
[1:58:00] now
[1:58:00] just give me five more minutes okay
[1:58:03] we'll get you into bed
[1:58:04] behold
[1:58:06] i show you a mystery
[1:58:09] amen
[1:58:12] in a moment
[1:58:14] he said i'll show you this we shall not
[1:58:15] all sleep
[1:58:17] but we shall all
[1:58:21] i love it oh doesn't mean anybody out
[1:58:23] here
[1:58:25] we should all be changed
[1:58:28] in a moment
[1:58:31] i want you to hold on to that word
[1:58:32] moment because we've been talking about
[1:58:34] time
[1:58:35] in a moment
[1:58:36] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:58:39] at the last trump for the trump shall
[1:58:40] sound and the dead shall rise
[1:58:42] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:58:46] for this corruptable must put on
[1:58:48] incorruption and this mortal
[1:58:50] must put on immortality
[1:58:53] so when this corruptable shall put on
[1:58:55] incorruption and this mortal shall put
[1:58:57] on
[1:58:58] immortality then shall be brought the
[1:59:00] past the saying that is written
[1:59:03] death
[1:59:03] is swallowed up
[1:59:06] in victory
[1:59:07] oh how sweet that is that's like honey
[1:59:11] honey falling down from heaven
[1:59:14] now
[1:59:15] that moment is an interesting word
[1:59:18] in a moment in the space of time
[1:59:21] because time's going to go into eternity
[1:59:23] but in a moment it's chaos
[1:59:26] which is a greek word and that's about
[1:59:29] all you need to think about
[1:59:32] like thomas some scholar
[1:59:36] no
[1:59:37] i just looked up the word
[1:59:40] keros
[1:59:44] it means
[1:59:46] flash
[1:59:47] or
[1:59:49] it means to make a puncture
[1:59:52] or a mark
[1:59:54] with a hot iron
[1:59:59] what that does
[2:00:01] in that moment
[2:00:03] it means a recognition of ownership
[2:00:09] so only those that are owned by god get
[2:00:12] changed in a moment
[2:00:18] it means a moment in an instant in an
[2:00:20] infinitesimal
[2:00:22] small moment of time
[2:00:25] god has already marked you out
[2:00:31] it's not that i'm going to be changed in
[2:00:33] the moment no you're already marked out
[2:00:35] for that moment
[2:00:37] you've already come from eternity for
[2:00:38] that moment because there's going to be
[2:00:41] a people that defeat death
[2:00:44] and you are that people
[2:00:46] [Applause]
[2:00:48] you've been marked
[2:00:50] marked
[2:00:51] marked by the holy ghost himself
[2:00:56] hallelujah
[2:00:59] think about it

[2:03:51] you people and brother brother erickson
[2:03:54] has a lovely church and lively body of
[2:03:56] christ we didn't come for that
[2:03:58] we came to hear the word
[2:04:00] to get our change
[2:04:03] not to tell you how smart we are how
[2:04:05] many quotes we can quote how much
[2:04:07] scripture we know that has nothing to
[2:04:09] know
[2:04:10] jesus said jesus or the scripture says
[2:04:13] which is jesus the word to know him is
[2:04:16] life
[2:04:17] eternal
[2:04:19] the person called jesus christ
[2:04:22] why did brother brown use the term
[2:04:25] end of time for a message
[2:04:27] junction of time
[2:04:29] time is at hand
[2:04:30] father the hour has now come
[2:04:32] time tested memorials sign of the time
[2:04:36] time tested faith time of decision end
[2:04:39] time seed sign end time evangelism
[2:04:41] scriptural signs of the time why was he
[2:04:44] nailing time because time will be
[2:04:47] no
[2:04:48] more
[2:05:03] huh everybody's so time conscious
[2:05:08] see i got an amen on that one
[2:05:12] why we're at the end time
[2:05:14] we're at the finish time
[2:05:16] but it's the time saints of god to claim
[2:05:18] your inheritance in christ jesus it's
[2:05:20] get away from playing church that's why
[2:05:22] he said if god before us where's all his
[2:05:24] miracles and and keep trying to preach
[2:05:26] and preach and preach and letting us
[2:05:28] know that's the time to halt play in
[2:05:30] church he said now the
[2:05:32] king of glory is amongst his people
[2:05:39] can you imagine i just don't know
[2:05:42] brother eriksen what i would do i just
[2:05:44] asked the brothers the other day we're
[2:05:45] sitting around having a little bite to
[2:05:46] eat brother wayne and i just they're
[2:05:48] just talking and i said can you imagine
[2:05:51] brother brahm said now the angel of
[2:05:53] lords he's right here
[2:05:55] knowing what you know right now
[2:05:58] it would be you'd be running for not a
[2:06:00] million dollars you'd be running to the
[2:06:02] altar where are you jesus
[2:06:06] i don't think one of us
[2:06:08] would just be waiting for him to tell us
[2:06:10] what we are i said lord you're standing
[2:06:12] right there
[2:06:14] i don't know why there wasn't a pile up
[2:06:16] at the pulpit
[2:06:19] but that's me being carnal
[2:06:22] because as soon as you come he'll
[2:06:23] probably wave over that sister dear that
[2:06:25] has a problem
[2:06:29] i love this little story at the end here
[2:06:32] and this is just showing you that time
[2:06:34] is going to be swallowed up
[2:06:37] death
[2:06:38] swallowed up sickness
[2:06:40] swallowed up
[2:06:45] he said there was a person she'd come
[2:06:48] but i looked around
[2:06:50] i looked around now he's going into
[2:06:51] another world
[2:06:53] he said i looked around i saw a doctor
[2:06:55] well there wasn't a doctor on the
[2:06:56] platform so now he's broken into another
[2:06:58] realm
[2:06:59] he said i see a doctor
[2:07:03] he's wearing tortoise shell glasses
[2:07:07] he had one of those like whatever it was
[2:07:09] called wears on on his head to see down
[2:07:12] your throat
[2:07:16] he's discouraged he was shaking his head
[2:07:19] it's a thin doctor
[2:07:21] he's shaking his head he just performed
[2:07:23] the operation on a little colored girl
[2:07:25] paralyzed her
[2:07:28] she's paralyzed
[2:07:30] from the shoulders down
[2:07:32] can you imagine
[2:07:35] what kind of a ministry did god send us
[2:07:38] in this generation
[2:07:40] and a lot of times people just you know
[2:07:42] you know the first parts of the message
[2:07:44] are as profound as what's in the middle
[2:07:46] of the message and the end of the
[2:07:48] message is profound is what's in the
[2:07:49] middle you know people i just skipped
[2:07:51] the prayer line right what are you
[2:07:53] thinking
[2:07:56] that was god coming vindicating now what
[2:07:58] the word was saying
[2:08:00] so now here's god coming down brother
[2:08:03] branham doesn't see a doctor with
[2:08:04] tortoise shell glasses he's standing
[2:08:07] here
[2:08:09] so now
[2:08:11] he looks forward and he says now
[2:08:13] he said
[2:08:16] i turned my back around and
[2:08:18] i said to my brother bring the next
[2:08:19] patient bring the next patient now he's
[2:08:21] broke out of that realm and he's back
[2:08:23] into this round
[2:08:25] and then way
[2:08:27] way back way back i heard someone crying
[2:08:30] and i looked and here come a hospital
[2:08:33] stretcher like those along here
