[4:25] that God has given us amen it's good to
[4:27] have my family here today amen amen and
[4:30] U is always a blessing Amen brother um
[4:35] brother Vernon I've been I've been
[4:36] hearing him play the guitar since I was
[4:38] a little bitty
[4:41] fellow it's been a uh thank you amen
[4:45] makes a lot of difference uh but uh and
[4:48] uh it's it's always good to hear that uh
[4:51] takes me back when I just a little kid I
[4:54] just a little boy sitting on the front
[4:55] row and brother Vernon was playing the
[4:57] guitar and spirit of the Lord would
[4:59] follow in the church and you always know
[5:01] when it was really having church cuz
[5:03] Vernon
[5:08] he as he he he Clos he closed his eyes
[5:12] and I think how's he doing
[5:14] that but um the spirit of the Lord and
[5:16] it's real good to be here today and uh
[5:19] we have a few things on our heart but
[5:21] let's just go to the Lord in a word of
[5:24] prayer and just a moment of reverence to
[5:26] him and if there's a special need on
[5:29] your heart
[5:30] today we know that he's still
[5:33] God and that through the foolishness of
[5:36] preaching he said that he would
[5:38] save and I believe that today that it's
[5:41] it's still important that we preach the
[5:44] gospel that we bow our hearts in his
[5:46] presence and ask him for his Mercy
[5:49] Heavenly Father
[5:50] we're we're your children Lord
[5:53] and because we've been birthed of the
[5:56] word Lord there's something in our heart
[5:58] that rings that this is the
[6:00] truth Lord we've sold to it we're Lock
[6:04] Stock and Barrel Lord You're our only
[6:08] hope we've not left something else to
[6:11] grasp to we've we've sold ourselves to

[6:19] children we look to you Lord for our
[6:22] protection and our guidance and our
[6:23] leadership

[6:28] that we have is wrong and only your word
[6:30] is right now father we we follow you
[6:34] Lord and we ask for your great anointing
[6:37] to come in this meeting this morning

[6:42] great General you're the one that's
[6:44] taught our Hands to War you teach us
[6:46] Lord how to overcome our enemies and you

[7:32] Hope Lord it would come and father we're

[7:37] and use it Lord for thy Glory we ask it
[7:40] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[7:44] and amen and God bless you this morning
[7:47] we want to turn into the scripture into
[7:50] the book of
[7:51] Ephesians um I've U been holding a
[7:55] thought here um milk honey and Giants in
[7:58] my personal studies uh it just some
[8:01] things that was real to me um but I I
[8:05] want to uh continue in this line of
[8:07] thought I'm I'm still in Daniel chap 11
[8:11] the 32nd verse but I want to read from
[8:13] the book of
[8:14] Ephesians uh the people that know their
[8:16] God uh shall do great exploits they
[8:19] shall be strong they will know him the
[8:21] people and I'm I'm one who believes that
[8:24] that people is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[8:27] I believe that's the people that the
[8:29] ible was talking about in the book of
[8:31] Ephesians uh in the 11th verse Paul says
[8:35] here in Ephesians 1:11 he said in whom
[8:38] also we obtained an
[8:41] inheritance being predestinated
[8:44] according to the purpose of him who
[8:45] worketh all things after the counsel of
[8:49] his own will let's back up and read the
[8:52] fourth and the fifth verse according as
[8:55] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[8:59] found foundation of the world that we
[9:02] should be holy and Without Blame before
[9:05] him in love now I'm going to ask this
[9:07] before we continue according as he now
[9:10] brother Bram asked this question who
[9:13] chose us he did amen and he ha chosen Us
[9:18] in him when did he choose before the
[9:22] foundation of the world that we should
[9:25] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[9:27] love having an you remember brother
[9:30] Brown actually uh starts cutting a
[9:32] little bit of a joke and when he reads
[9:34] this in the adoption he starts spelling
[9:35] it p r e d because he won't say it out
[9:37] loud because the legalists don't like
[9:39] this word so he just starts spelling it
[9:42] and he said I better quit fun it now and
[9:44] then so he he says the word
[9:47] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[9:50] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[9:52] according to the good pleasure of his
[9:55] will amen the predestination unto adopt
[10:00] amen we ask the Lord to bless his word
[10:02] as you could be seated this morning uh I
[10:04] do believe uh that the church has a
[10:08] mountain I believe that there is a
[10:10] position the church has been promised um
[10:13] I believe that that promise that God has
[10:15] made to the church is our inheritance I
[10:18] I certainly believe that what God gives
[10:21] us I believe we're able to have
[10:23] it I believe that if God gives something
[10:26] to you that he is Sovereign and he has a
[10:29] right to give to you because he is
[10:32] Sovereign God Amen when I when I look at
[10:34] this this morning and I think about it
[10:36] and maybe we would say to ourselves what
[10:39] what mountain would the church be on
[10:41] today What place would we be on today um
[10:44] I can look at this in uh from the
[10:46] scripture now in Genesis chapter 22 as
[10:49] the children of Abraham if you go to
[10:51] Genesis chapter 22 and you uh remember
[10:55] now uh Abraham has had a promise of a
[10:58] son and uh this is the promised son
[11:01] Isaac uh who is only a type of Jesus
[11:04] Christ and he's he's waited for years
[11:07] for this son to come now as the sun
[11:10] begins to mature God at the end of
[11:13] Abraham's life uh calls him to go to a
[11:15] mountain and on that mountain he is
[11:18] supposed to sacrifice uh his only son
[11:20] Isaac uh he's supposed to give his life
[11:23] there the scripture tells us in Genesis
[11:26] 22 uh that it was about a 3-day Journey
[11:29] when Abraham come to the place of this
[11:32] mountain now this mountain uh that he
[11:34] went on of course uh we named uh Gracie
[11:38] after this mountain Mount Mariah uh I
[11:40] always thought it was a a beautiful name
[11:42] Mariah it was a mountain of Grace it's
[11:44] where God's grace came uh it was where
[11:47] God got the name Jehovah Gyra which is
[11:51] which is pretty powerful the name
[11:53] Jehovah Gyra I tell you one of the first
[11:55] times that I ever I went to India
[11:57] actually I went with brother uh Tony
[11:59] abma it was uh early on and brother Tony
[12:02] came by there in that little church in
[12:03] Arkansas and he was telling all about
[12:05] Mission work and I've been to South
[12:07] Africa and met the Indian people in
[12:09] South Africa and had preached for them I
[12:11] fell in love with them and and uh I was
[12:14] still working on the food a little but I
[12:16] but I I love the people and uh brother
[12:18] Tony said uh he said why don't you come
[12:20] go with us over to India and and I said
[12:22] well brother Tony I said we're we're
[12:24] poor people and and it's a small Church
[12:26] there's just no way I don't I don't have
[12:28] that kind of money he said well God
[12:30] provided if he's called you to travel
[12:32] and do it so I said well I tell you what
[12:34] if the Lord if the Lord provides it I'm
[12:36] going to go that's it I'm just going to
[12:37] go and so we we it was a Wednesday night
[12:40] and brother Tony came and he got up in
[12:42] front of the church and uh but just in
[12:45] the in the back uh I talked to him a
[12:47] little bit and something funny had
[12:49] happened right before church is Mariah I
[12:51] see now uh that would have been I was uh
[12:54] 30 30 31 years old so I don't remember
[12:57] how old Gracie was we
[12:59] Bethany had just been born so it was it
[13:02] she was about a year old so how about
[13:03] four years old maybe so Mariah comes in
[13:06] there and said dad I heard y'all talking
[13:08] about you going to India and I said yeah
[13:10] and she had a she had a I believe it was
[13:12] a dollar and she said to me she said Dad
[13:15] she said here I'm going to give you this
[13:17] to go to India and I never will forget
[13:19] it she gave me that dollar and um well
[13:22] when brother Tony in the back room I was
[13:24] laughing telling him about the a kid's
[13:27] mind thinking that a dollar would send
[13:28] you India you know and so I told him
[13:31] about the story well he comes out to the
[13:33] platform and tells the church the story
[13:36] and then when he did he reached in his
[13:37] pocket and pulled out $100 and he said
[13:40] here he said the dollar just become a
[13:42] hundred and then before we left the
[13:44] service that night of course then we
[13:46] were going to India uh the holy spirit
[13:49] amen um and I found out his name was
[13:52] Jehovah Gyra uh that if God wanted you
[13:54] to go he was able to provide the means
[13:56] for you to go and he can start with a
[13:58] dollar
[14:00] amen so don't you think that God can't
[14:02] take something very small and make it
[14:04] big amen uh so but but in this in this
[14:07] story it was on Mount Mariah here that
[14:10] Abraham took a Isaac and um of course it
[14:13] sounds a little more like an Easter
[14:15] message but uh but Abraham took Isaac
[14:18] and went up on the mountain he was to go
[14:20] there and make a human sacrifice now
[14:22] until this time the only sacrifice had
[14:25] been Lambs but here now is the first
[14:28] time the idea of human sacrifice would
[14:30] be put into the into the thought and it
[14:32] would be a human sacrifice would be
[14:34] Abraham's son and uh the scripture tells
[14:37] us that Abraham of course going to take
[14:38] Isaac up and and he's going to uh slay
[14:41] him on the mountain when he gets ready
[14:42] to go he takes Abraham some wood in the
[14:44] fire uh and he takes Isaac and he starts
[14:47] going up the mountain and the Bible says
[14:50] uh that as Abraham and Isaac are going
[14:52] up the mountain that Isaac says father
[14:54] here's the wood and here's the fire but
[14:57] where is the Lamb right so he he
[15:01] understands the order of worship would
[15:03] require a lamb amen but but God had so
[15:07] instituted it that Isaac was going to be
[15:10] the Lamb on that sacrifice of course
[15:12] that was a testament of Jesus Christ who
[15:15] was the Seed of Abraham who would come
[15:17] to replace the Lamb's sacrifice that it
[15:20] would be a human sacrifice now when they
[15:22] get up the mountain and Abraham being
[15:25] obedient the scripture tells us that he
[15:27] he ties up he ties up Isaac and I've
[15:30] always I've always thought brother Rams
[15:32] had his little chubby hands he put them
[15:33] out there and he tied them he said now
[15:35] of course he wasn't forcing Isaac Isaac
[15:38] was submitting to the will of Abraham to
[15:41] be sacrificed and I thought to myself I
[15:43] wonder uh what kind of story that a
[15:45] father would tell a son that a son would
[15:47] let him bind him knowing he's going to
[15:49] cut him but but there was something he
[15:52] was able to deliver unto Isaac that
[15:54] would raise Isaac's Faith to the same
[15:57] place that Abraham Faith was see Isaac
[16:00] and Abraham would have had the same
[16:03] understanding of the outcome of what was
[16:05] going to come from that mountain and and
[16:07] Abraham had already told his servants
[16:09] before they went up he said the boy and
[16:11] I are going up and the boy and I are
[16:13] going to return amen see brother Ram
[16:16] said see he knew even if he killed him
[16:18] on the altar that the god that had gave
[16:20] him would raise him up again and somehow
[16:23] he had preached the idea of Resurrection
[16:26] to Isaac amen and that that idea now the
[16:29] beautiful thing is is the the gospel
[16:31] that Isaac would have heard would have
[16:33] been a conglomeration of the stories
[16:36] that had happened from Abraham from the
[16:38] calling of Abraham until that day very
[16:41] day of the mountain had it happened any
[16:43] other time in the story Abraham couldn't
[16:46] have told the whole story of course it's
[16:47] a type of the end time message of how
[16:51] that the Church of the Living God in the
[16:53] end time is to receive the same Faith
[16:55] the same faith that Abraham received the
[16:58] church is going to have Abraham's Faith
[17:01] going to have Enoch's Faith going to
[17:04] have Jesus Faith but that faith will
[17:06] come from the Deliverance of a message
[17:09] that wholly tells the story of
[17:11] redemption from Eden all the way to the
[17:15] day we're living in see in in the age of
[17:18] Abraham he couldn't tell the stories of
[17:20] of of Joseph and he couldn't tell the
[17:22] stories of of Ezekiel and Malachi see it
[17:26] couldn't happen but now in this age we
[17:28] can tell tell every one of the stories
[17:31] from Adam's story to Abraham's story to
[17:33] Moses story to noses see to Noah to we
[17:36] can sit here and stay with David you can
[17:38] take every type in the scripture to show
[17:41] that this single thing is what God has
[17:44] had on his mind from the beginning see
[17:47] this is this is the only portion that
[17:49] has been in every story that was ever
[17:52] told in the scripture there's nothing
[17:55] else happening in history today that
[17:57] matches SE to show what God had on his
[18:00] mind the entire time and that what was
[18:02] going on on the mountain was God was
[18:05] showing Isaac by Abraham's testimony he
[18:08] he brought us out he met us when we were
[18:11] Barren God met us in the flesh he's
[18:13] changed our bodies he's gave you as a
[18:16] son don't worry if I have to take your
[18:18] life God will raise you up again and in
[18:21] that Obedience of the last trial of
[18:25] Abraham's life now you can hear sermons
[18:27] like uh possessing the enemy gate after
[18:29] the trial you can hear that brother Ram
[18:31] uses the story and you think why he
[18:34] waited all those years for a child and
[18:36] then he was tested on the child amen and
[18:38] think of this here the church has been
[18:40] waiting for all this time for a
[18:42] Vindicated word and now God test you on
[18:45] the Vindicated word itself other words
[18:48] it isn't just enough that we've received
[18:49] it now you've been tried to whether or
[18:51] not you're going to believe it in the
[18:53] face of every situation but of course
[18:55] you're going to believe it in the face
[18:57] of every situation but you only possess
[19:00] the gates after the trial so the message
[19:03] ain't on trial your faith is what's on
[19:05] trial amen but when your faith Amen
[19:08] correlates to the same Faith as
[19:10] Abraham's then you possess the Gate of
[19:12] your enemy now watch here because the
[19:15] scripture tells us amen that Abraham did
[19:18] not take the life of his son God
[19:20] prevented it and then when he prevented
[19:22] it Abraham heard a ram in the background
[19:26] and he turned and seen a ram hung by his
[19:28] horns in the thicket now there's types
[19:30] and all of that and it's not my point so
[19:32] I'm not going to preach it but but it's
[19:33] a beautiful it's a beautiful preaching
[19:35] but the realm itself brother Ram takes
[19:38] the RAM and he said I want you to notice
[19:40] something about the realm it's a he it's
[19:42] a ram it's a he Ram he said which
[19:45] testifies of the manifested word of
[19:49] God so you can look at this everybody
[19:52] all denominations can look and see that
[19:55] Jesus is in that story as Isaac but it
[19:59] took a prophet to show you the bride in
[20:02] the story as a ram now how do you when
[20:05] you see that it was a heam brother Ram
[20:08] says see of course there is Malachi the
[20:10] 4th chapter now who could have found
[20:12] Malachi 4 in Genesis 22 but a prophet he
[20:16] uncovers it by saying that it's a ram
[20:19] and then he turns to Genesis uh 15 and
[20:22] he shows Abraham's sacrifice of five
[20:24] animals the third animal in the
[20:26] sacrifice is a ram it's a it's a male
[20:29] but man said see here that the realm is
[20:32] a male it is a
[20:34] created it is a created realm it's God's
[20:37] spoken word Ram so he shows us then that
[20:41] the ram is the manifested word of God
[20:44] now now so that you can get it real
[20:46] clear he's using the realm to show you
[20:50] that the bride in the last day marries
[20:53] the word and not a church he said see if
[20:56] it was a she see what it would be then
[20:59] the Baptist would be joining with a shei
[21:01] church she would be joining with she the
[21:04] Methodist but he's showing you in
[21:06] Scripture that the bride will be
[21:08] marrying the manifested creative word of
[21:12] God in the last day so the mountain that
[21:15] we are on represents the mountain
[21:18] Abraham was on the mountain the bride is
[21:21] taking today is the mountain of the
[21:24] third pool which is Christ you see
[21:27] brother manam said the the third pole
[21:29] cannot be impersonated right he said
[21:31] Satan can do everything that Jesus could
[21:34] do but he can't be him see he can act
[21:38] like him but he can't be him the third
[21:40] pool is him see it's it's not acting
[21:44] it's not doing something like him it is
[21:47] him the third pole is Christ the
[21:50] manifested word in the last day so the
[21:53] Church of the Living God is on the
[21:55] mountain of manifesting him Christ the
[21:59] word that's the mountain they're on now
[22:01] to make that a little clearer to you
[22:03] Amen Let let's look at this and see the
[22:05] manifested word now you can take it from
[22:08] here and you can go to acts the 15th
[22:10] chapter and the 14th verse when the
[22:13] gospel first become to the Gentiles
[22:15] remember there was an argument among the
[22:17] Disciples of whether the Gentiles should
[22:19] be included somebody brought up the Old
[22:21] Testament Prophecy from The Book of Amos
[22:24] and then again said Simon had declared
[22:26] how God at the first had visit the
[22:28] Gentiles watch he visited them to take
[22:31] of them a people for his name you see
[22:34] what God visited the Gentiles for a
[22:37] purpose how many knows this has been the
[22:40] day of visitation that God has visited
[22:44] this Gentile age he made a visitation
[22:48] for the purpose of the calling out of
[22:50] the Bride a lot of people tell you the
[22:52] message is allow a lot of things it's
[22:54] not about building churches it's not
[22:56] about building Ministries it's not about
[22:58] about who's right and who's wrong God
[23:00] has visited this generation to take out
[23:03] a bride of every denomination for the
[23:06] purpose that there would be somebody who
[23:09] could marry to the manifested word of
[23:12] the age that we're living in in other
[23:14] words God visited here to get a bride
[23:16] for him amen amen there's a lot of
[23:18] people there's a lot of brides but he
[23:20] wanted one for watch his name isn't that
[23:23] beautiful his name that realm is a he
[23:27] amen that for a people for his name amen
[23:30] watch this next verse and to agree with
[23:32] the words of the prophets as it is
[23:34] written so it's Old Testament as it is
[23:36] written and after this will I return and
[23:39] build again the Tabernacle of David
[23:41] which is fallen down I will build again
[23:42] the ruins thereof I will set it up now
[23:45] I'm not going to preach on it the
[23:46] Tabernacle of David in short is a
[23:49] tabernacle of Praise built outside of
[23:52] tradition in the days when David built
[23:54] the Tabernacle praise the tent of
[23:57] Tabernacle he he made daily sacrifices
[23:59] sing daily daily shed the Bloods all the
[24:02] while Mosaic law was still in Tradition
[24:06] down in another place at the same time
[24:09] that the law was being worshiped by
[24:11] tradition David was worshiping under
[24:14] Revelation and praise in other words
[24:17] there would be two things in existence
[24:19] at the same time there would be a layot
[24:21] toy of church age and a bride age at the
[24:24] same time that will be a Pentecost
[24:26] caught in world tradition amen but
[24:28] there's been a seventh angel come to
[24:31] call the bride out of the tradition to
[24:34] the genuine atonement of the word of God
[24:37] we have heard the gospel trumpet sound
[24:39] to the church come out of her my people
[24:43] and be not partakers of her fornications
[24:46] amen but what is it when that when that
[24:48] church is built up again as a tabernacle
[24:51] of David not in Tradition but in Praise
[24:54] of almighty God Amen worshiping intense
[24:58] the word intense amen the word living
[25:02] intense I'm talking about a third pool
[25:04] church I'm talking about the word
[25:06] intense again among the Church of the
[25:08] Living God and the blood and the
[25:11] sacrifice being a daily ritual and the
[25:13] songs being a daily ritual not going
[25:16] once in a while to church to worship but
[25:19] a daily continual worship of the spirit
[25:22] of God living in the tent with the
[25:24] church oh my what a blessing to live in
[25:27] this house hour what a day amen pull
[25:30] that scripture back amen the scripture
[25:32] is talking about somebody pulled out
[25:35] amen somebody pulled out I will begin
[25:37] build again and I will set it up now if
[25:40] you wondering who's setting this up he
[25:42] just told you you wondering who's
[25:44] building this bride he just told you
[25:46] I'll build it I'll set it up I will
[25:49] build my church I'll set the thing up
[25:51] I'll design it I'll make it the way I
[25:53] want what's that next one he said that
[25:55] the residue of men we I preach this from
[25:58] the Old Testament it's powerful I don't
[25:59] have time to preach it it's just a a
[26:01] passing thought to you this morning amen
[26:04] but the residue of men might seek after
[26:06] the Lord my goodness that the residue of
[26:09] men that the lower part of men the
[26:12] rejects the oddballs the people that
[26:15] nobody else
[26:17] wanted I'll take that and build again
[26:20] the Tabernacle of David I'll take the
[26:22] people that everybody throwed out and
[26:24] I'll move into them with my word and
[26:27] make it a habit ation of the most holy
[26:29] God Amen the Angels cannot go where this
[26:32] residue can go amen the world cannot go
[26:35] where this residue could go but as the
[26:38] Bride of Jesus Christ he has put his
[26:40] name on the residue of men and took
[26:43] nobody's and made somebody's he took
[26:45] nothing to do something oh Church of the
[26:48] Living God God has took what nobody
[26:51] wanted and made something glorious out
[26:54] of it my he's a mighty God this morning
[26:57] and he saw us out of all the Gentiles
[27:00] upon whom my name is called saeth the
[27:02] Lord who doeth all things amen now what
[27:05] we're looking at as we're looking at
[27:07] Prophecy of the scripture again it is
[27:10] written in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and
[27:13] verse 7 I'm using this he the Bible said
[27:16] the mystery of iniquity doth work and
[27:18] will work amen it's already working who
[27:21] now leth will let that's God will let
[27:24] this happen until now that until is he
[27:28] he be taken out of the way there's two
[27:30] he's there he will let till he be taken
[27:33] out of the way he God will let until he
[27:37] the bride be taken out of the way that
[27:39] he is the bride so people said well how
[27:42] you identify her as a bride watch it in
[27:44] the negative in the church ages the
[27:46] Bible said the teachings of balam and
[27:48] then it said that woman Jezebel Amen
[27:51] brother man said watch how that Jezebel
[27:53] amen she became something by teachings
[27:56] it changes designation and so does the
[27:59] bride when she receives his name she's
[28:01] now identified with the not feminine but
[28:05] with the male name of Jesus Christ all
[28:08] of the heavens and earth amen testify
[28:10] that her is the name of Jesus Christ she
[28:13] carries the name then he will let until
[28:16] he be taken out of the way amen
[28:18] something has happened there has been a
[28:21] marriage there has been an
[28:23] identification of Christ into the Church
[28:25] of the Living God until a prophet was
[28:28] would say the seven seal brings him back
[28:32] to the Earth is that right and then
[28:34] he'll turn around and say she is him
[28:38] there has been an identification that
[28:40] when a prophet looked at you he said the
[28:43] church and God have now become one and
[28:46] he has identifying himself as a bride
[28:48] let's put it in another way God all that
[28:51] he was ped into Christ and all that's in
[28:54] Christ has been poured into the bride
[28:56] until now when God look looks at the
[28:58] bride he looks at his own power his own
[29:02] atonement his own work this is the bride
[29:05] is him she is him she walks in his power
[29:10] she's bone of his bone flesh of his
[29:12] flesh authority of his authority oh my
[29:15] goodness amen I'm talking about
[29:17] something wonderful this morning the
[29:19] bride will know her mate the revealed
[29:22] word of the
[29:25] hour Daniel 11:32 the people shall know
[29:28] their God brother randam translates it
[29:30] to you and I the people will know their
[29:33] mate amen isn't that powerful the people
[29:35] will know their mate the revealed word
[29:38] is our mate that's why we're not going
[29:40] to back up from this message that's why
[29:43] you could give me 60 reasons brother
[29:44] Ram's wrong and I won't believe one of
[29:46] them amen you can give me all the
[29:48] reasons you want to I'm not believing
[29:50] one of them because it is my mate amen I
[29:54] have become one with it I don't I don't
[29:56] have another husband I don't have
[29:58] another idea I don't have another Choice
[30:01] there there's not either this or that
[30:03] amen this is all that to me it's my
[30:06] everything it's all that I am it's all
[30:08] that I ever hope to be I don't have
[30:11] another choice I don't have a backup
[30:13] plan amen if this is wrong we're in real
[30:15] trouble because I really believe it but
[30:17] it ain't wrong amen Heaven has witnessed
[30:20] to it amen the Earth has witnessed to it
[30:23] God has witnessed to it God has showed
[30:25] us beyond a shadow of doubt this is the
[30:29] Vindicated word of God in the age that
[30:32] you're living in my
[30:35] Lord somebody said well I never seen God
[30:37] do you see that's it's the translation
[30:39] of what you believe God is amen y'all
[30:42] remember what is God go listen to the
[30:44] message brother B takes it from the
[30:46] spirit into Christ into a bride amen one
[30:49] person in a prayer line said you ever
[30:51] want to see the face of God but just
[30:52] turn around and
[30:55] look you want to see the face of God God
[30:58] this
[30:59] morning now the veil is going to bother
[31:02] you don't let the veil bother you look
[31:05] at what's behind the
[31:08] veil Glory this is the unveiling of God
[31:12] not in Jesus not in Moses it's unveiled
[31:15] God in you if you would unzip the veil
[31:18] this morning behind the veil is a pillar
[31:21] of light that come off of almighty God
[31:24] that has cond descended into this age
[31:26] and by the power of the the blood has
[31:28] stepped into a human body It Now
[31:31] controls your
[31:35] destiny you don't believe God could
[31:37] write something and be wrong about what
[31:39] he
[31:41] wrote now now there's no it alls and
[31:44] then there's
[31:49] God he knows everything and can do
[31:51] something with what he
[31:53] knows right he's the only one that can
[31:56] put in power God what he thinks what he
[31:59] desires that pillar of light comes to
[32:02] design our destiny think about this the
[32:05] bride will know her mate now now if you
[32:08] want to maybe say this let's go to and
[32:11] see the bride will know her mate the
[32:12] revealed word improving his word now I'm
[32:15] just giving you a little little tidbits
[32:16] you write them down go look them up and
[32:17] then we'll read them later but but
[32:19] improving his word one of the greatest
[32:22] most powerful quotes I think you'll ever
[32:24] read brother B said the son of man has
[32:26] come into human flesh yes to join is
[32:30] that right to join to join the bride and
[32:34] Christ together that's what he was doing
[32:37] to join that's when he announces the
[32:40] marriage has already come now if you
[32:43] want to take time brother Reagan did a
[32:45] good time job on it I don't have time to
[32:46] preach on don't know if I have the
[32:47] ability to preach on the way he would
[32:49] but but he showed specifically how we
[32:51] move from bride to wife I really never
[32:53] had seen the the point in it personally
[32:55] I'll just be honest but but the other
[32:57] day today I was talking to somebody and
[32:58] they said well yeah they keep calling us
[33:00] bride but the way they're calling us
[33:02] bride is like somehow something might
[33:04] change between here and there but if you
[33:06] really want to be wordy and you want to
[33:08] get down to the revelation we are not
[33:11] just bride we actually have become
[33:14] wife you see this we're not bride in the
[33:17] sense that we're just a spouse we have
[33:19] become wife we literally have entered
[33:22] into relationship with Christ there
[33:24] there is one Spirit one strength one
[33:27] blood we have entered into being wife he
[33:30] brother R will now announce that the
[33:32] marriage has already
[33:35] come you got every right this morning
[33:38] Amen to to claim every right that a wife
[33:43] would claim of a husband you have a
[33:45] right to claim of almighty
[33:49] God it's the
[33:51] truth you say well brother Wayne what
[33:54] what kind of point would would have to
[33:56] come from this because with the moment
[33:58] brother brandham does this enjoins it he
[34:00] says something on the end of the quote
[34:01] and you look it up sometime they might
[34:03] find it before we're done with it but
[34:04] but he'll say it like this he says what
[34:07] will it do
[34:08] then if I'm going to join these two
[34:11] together what will it do then he said it
[34:13] will manifest the son of man again all
[34:18] most illegalist hate that one amen
[34:21] because you know of course that's only
[34:22] in a prophet right that's only something
[34:24] for a prophet but brother Brandon said
[34:26] when this bride recognizes and gets a
[34:29] hold of and joins together with it will
[34:32] manifest the son of man
[34:35] again amen again in other words not
[34:37] something new they will do it again amen
[34:40] they'll be a part of what God has did
[34:43] they will do it again I I'll show it to
[34:45] you in the Bible in John 12 verse 28
[34:48] Jesus said unto the father father
[34:50] glorify my name and in the 28th verse
[34:53] the Bible said he said to him glorify
[34:55] thy name and there come a voice from
[34:57] heaven saying a voice from Heaven saying
[34:59] who knows what that voice from Heaven it
[35:01] was the
[35:03] Thunders come on it was the Thunder
[35:05] that's the way brother Ram explains the
[35:06] Thunders from this scripture it was a
[35:08] voice from Heaven seven Thunders uttered
[35:10] and said I have glorified it and I will
[35:13] glorify it again then it's not us
[35:17] glorifying ourselves it's not us making
[35:19] something of ourselves this is God
[35:22] glorifying the bride by bringing the
[35:24] word of all the ages in I want you to
[35:27] see something all the ages desire to see
[35:31] or to read what you are now living
[35:35] you're not just reading it you're not
[35:37] just talking about it you're not just
[35:39] hearing the preaching of it you are the
[35:42] very thing that God has hid in his mind
[35:45] from the foundations of The World God
[35:48] has glorified the residue of men by the
[35:52] pillar of light that has come upon the
[35:54] church I can show you that a pillar of
[35:56] fire brother random said his name now
[35:58] identified and adopted Sons and
[36:00] Daughters of God the pillar of fire is
[36:02] not in heaven the pillar of fire is not
[36:04] over a grave somewhere the pillar of
[36:06] fire is not hanging in brandom
[36:08] Tabernacle the pillar of fire is over
[36:11] the word of the bride and this age
[36:14] manifested Glory manifested power the
[36:17] light and the power and the faith of
[36:19] almighty God it's our origin it's our
[36:23] destiny it's our life he said I will
[36:26] glorify
[36:30] again
[36:32] Hallelujah glory to God yeah it's
[36:35] something to shout about all the ages
[36:37] long to see it all the ages desire and
[36:41] you are what they only look to
[36:49] see my goodness I feel like speaking in
[36:52] another
[36:53] language I'd use it if it would help me
[36:59] to glorify
[37:01] again to Glory with the glory you had
[37:04] before the world began you may not
[37:08] you're just a little snowbody and you
[37:10] think so small of yourself but do you
[37:12] know you had Glory with God before the
[37:15] world ever began the inspiration for God
[37:18] to create a world was you the
[37:20] inspiration for God to created Eden was
[37:22] you the inspiration that God had in all
[37:25] the creation that was a motive behind it
[37:28] all it was a bride to share in the
[37:31] atoning power my I I want you I want you
[37:34] to understand something a man does
[37:35] something he builds a house he builds a
[37:37] certain way he does a certain thing
[37:39] motives are behind
[37:40] that usually a woman's behind
[37:46] that all the brothers is saying
[37:53] amen you know it's right many of you
[37:55] like me you live in a on the side of the
[37:58] river if it's up to
[38:02] you a concrete one so I wouldn't have to
[38:05] paint
[38:07] it that's the truth you don't think it's
[38:10] truth that as my father-in-law he
[38:12] worried that I wasn't going to buy a
[38:14] house you got wonder what's he going to
[38:17] do with my
[38:19] daughter good thing he trusted the
[38:25] Lord it's the truth got to trust the
[38:28] Lord he takes care of
[38:32] things
[38:33] glorify again yes sir it's it's amazing
[38:37] the word again it's again written in
[38:40] Revelation chapter 10 so well-placed
[38:43] behind the seventh Angels message John
[38:46] is told to eat the
[38:48] book to Devour the book and that the
[38:52] word would be in his mouth so then he
[38:54] said because thou have eaten
[38:57] because of the word that's in your mouth
[39:00] you must prophesy again look what he
[39:03] said he said thou must prophesy again
[39:07] let me tell you you ever eat this
[39:08] message and they can't shut you
[39:11] up it it will it's going to come out of
[39:14] you you can't help
[39:16] it it's going to come out of you it's
[39:18] it's a must amen amen do you see that
[39:21] must prophesy and I just love it
[39:24] again
[39:26] again now now I'm going to I y'all
[39:30] wearing your seat
[39:33] belts a prophet said it like this he
[39:37] said it he said it very clearly you
[39:40] say what I
[39:42] said on those tapes that's good ain't it
[39:47] now not only am I confined to the tapes
[39:50] but I'm commanded to speak what's on the
[39:52] tapes that goes two ways don't it cuz
[39:55] some of the things on the tape I found
[39:57] out the people that said say what
[39:58] brother Bram said did did not want me
[40:01] saying what brother Bram said cuz on the
[40:04] same tape he said say what I say if you
[40:06] go on and follow on you'll say he'll
[40:08] come through and say the bride will
[40:09] manifest the son of man again the bride
[40:11] is the the literal Life of Christ the
[40:14] bride is one but see these these things
[40:16] like he says like this like what what
[40:18] about this one where he says the voice
[40:21] is in the
[40:23] bride we can can we say that one the
[40:26] voice is in the the bride is that right
[40:29] if the voice is in the bride now now
[40:31] hold your shock Factor but this is the
[40:33] truth that's what the spirit was
[40:35] speaking on the wings of a snow white
[40:38] dove when brother Ram screamed out in
[40:40] the spirit and said I will ride this
[40:43] Trail again I will ride it again what's
[40:47] he talking about brother Ram's not
[40:48] talking about bringing a t and traveling
[40:51] across America flying in an airplane and
[40:53] setting up meetings and people attending
[40:55] his meetings he's talking about the
[40:57] words that I have prophesied was not my
[41:00] own but they're now embodied into a
[41:03] church AB bride a many member body and
[41:06] they'll live the bride will live and
[41:09] then lay out to see and age she'll turn
[41:11] it in to a bride manifestation of
[41:14] almighty God I'll ride the trail again
[41:17] now if you if you don't if you don't
[41:19] think if you think brother Ram was
[41:20] talking about himself Jesus had the same
[41:22] problem when he cried from the cross
[41:25] because he said it he said I thirst I
[41:28] thirst it was the words that David spoke
[41:30] from Psalms 22 when he spoke it brother
[41:33] man said it wasn't David speaking it was
[41:35] Christ speaking through David I thirst
[41:39] and the same cry spoke through
[41:42] a come on he's either a prophet or he
[41:45] ain't well you say he's a prophet then
[41:48] he's a
[41:49] mute then he's a mute and it wasn't him
[41:54] speaking come on now the the arguers of
[41:57] the these cases will argue with I'm
[41:58] talking about Giants friends the Giants
[42:00] in these cases will argue brother
[42:02] Brandon was a prophet and the only one
[42:04] that could speak the word he was the
[42:05] only one that could have this ministry
[42:07] he's the only one that could be this and
[42:09] I certainly agree but when the man with
[42:11] the ministry amen opened up his vessel
[42:14] and the God that he was serving poured
[42:16] out an anointing for a bride to follow
[42:19] after him with the words that he has
[42:21] spoken that I'm not standing here
[42:24] building a platform for myself but a
[42:26] proph has stood before us and laid a
[42:29] platform of the spoken word upon the
[42:32] Church of the Living God Amen and here
[42:35] she stands I'll ride this Trail again
[42:38] can I say it better I'll ride this Trail
[42:40] again say what I
[42:42] said again say what I
[42:46] said
[42:49] again I know some people won't like my
[42:52] interpretation of that but that's okay I
[42:54] don't believe it's
[42:55] mine I believe that was the true intent
[42:58] of the
[43:00] statement my goodness now let let's just
[43:03] do it for the sake of this saying this
[43:05] if somebody else took that statement
[43:07] I'll ride this Trail again and beat
[43:09] built
[43:11] doctrines that held the truth out of
[43:15] bride
[43:16] manifestation what kind of devil would
[43:20] try to hold you out of the treasures of
[43:23] letting the word live through you and
[43:25] manifesting what the scripture spoke of
[43:28] you it is a wrong interpretation of
[43:30] scripture that cuts it off from the
[43:32] church but a true interpretation will
[43:34] throw the doors wide open and every
[43:37] person sitting here even the residue
[43:39] even the smallest child will say to
[43:42] themselves I can walk into that I can
[43:44] step into that realm I can walk where
[43:47] God walks come on not everybody in here
[43:49] is going to speak squirrels I'm with you
[43:51] but the potential to do so is laying on
[43:54] the inside of every believer in the
[43:58] church am man it's not that you have to
[44:00] go around speaking to everything around
[44:02] you but there's a potential that lays
[44:04] into you and that potential in the right
[44:07] place at the right time God could use
[44:09] you for whatever he desires to use
[44:13] you I think it's time to take the limits
[44:15] off of
[44:19] God now brother maram calls of the final
[44:22] voice the voice of the message can I say
[44:26] it like this the Alpha has become the
[44:28] Omega in 1 Thessalonians 4 we are not
[44:31] identified as the shout we are
[44:33] identified as the bride we have been
[44:36] moved from just loud to sin to being the
[44:39] voice of the Bride the third pull is in
[44:44] the
[44:45] bride glory to
[44:52] God I I think a statement like that has
[44:56] to be backed up
[45:00] the third pull is in the bride let me
[45:02] let me help you let me help you bring it
[45:05] um uh let's help the entrance of that
[45:08] thought let's do it like this the word
[45:11] is in the bride how's
[45:15] that spoken word original SE pick up
[45:17] your pen and write brother Ram picked up
[45:19] the pen and wrote it and then he read
[45:22] the quote of an angel from the pulpit
[45:25] which tells me that the bride has the
[45:28] right to read the quotes of an angel
[45:31] from the
[45:34] pulpit is that right then the word is in
[45:38] the bride Let Me Go a step further he
[45:41] said she'll know what he wants done with
[45:43] the
[45:44] word amen he said she'll have thus saith
[45:49] the Lord woo I tell people say all times
[45:53] brother way Ain't nobody got thus sayith
[45:55] the Lord but a prophet I agree but we've
[45:57] had a
[45:59] prophet we've had a prophet and that
[46:02] Prophet gave us thus sayth the Lord now
[46:05] the church sits here with their mind
[46:08] fixed upon thus sayith the Lord we're
[46:10] not a people Carried Away by every wind
[46:13] of Doctrine we are grounded and settled
[46:15] in the revelation of the adoption of the
[46:17] church in the last day with all
[46:19] authority with all power with all the
[46:22] anointing that God has placed within the
[46:24] church then the word is in the bride the
[46:26] third pool p is the opening of the word
[46:30] and on one's end time third p is the
[46:31] open of the word he says it like this or
[46:33] the opening of Seven
[46:37] Seals what was opened in the Seven Seals
[46:40] is not only in the seven seal book it is
[46:43] now in the
[46:44] bride so if the third pull is the
[46:47] opening of The Seven Seals and that
[46:48] comes in you the third pull is in the
[46:52] Bride Can I can I give you this one the
[46:54] third pull is to the total LW
[46:58] that's good isn't it it's two the total
[47:00] lost he said but it's for the
[47:03] bride who's it for then who's the third
[47:06] pull for it's for the bride the third
[47:09] pole is for the bride now according to
[47:11] Paul in Ephesians chapter one then we
[47:13] are predestinated unto the adoption of
[47:16] children by Jesus Christ then our
[47:18] adoption is our predestination God
[47:20] ordained us to this specific time and
[47:23] age according to Romans the 8th chapter
[47:26] we have been elected and ordained and
[47:29] called unto be conformed unto the image
[47:31] of his son now short the image of his
[47:35] son speaks of the glory amen the seed
[47:38] put in the ground starts growing again
[47:39] there's there's a husk and there's a
[47:41] stock and and there's stages of it but
[47:44] all those stages are not the glory of
[47:46] the Original Seed but when you pass the
[47:48] seed back to seed again you're moving
[47:51] from glory to glory or from image back
[47:54] to image again is that right then the
[47:56] church is not ordained to Shu they're
[47:59] ordained to the original image that was
[48:01] in the mind of God I tell you it's a
[48:04] powerful thing when you see it when you
[48:06] see that Abraham's son come through
[48:10] Mary it's a powerful thing when you see
[48:13] it that the seed amen has to come
[48:16] through Pentecost but Pentecost was not
[48:19] the
[48:21] seed now the word was in The Bride it
[48:24] will be for the bride the predestination
[48:27] is to adoption let's get this point
[48:29] election chose you predestination tells
[48:32] you of your
[48:34] destiny predestination gives you your
[48:38] destiny I love that predestination
[48:42] giving to
[48:44] Destiny I want to maybe say this to you
[48:48] the Bible said my people are destroyed
[48:50] by a lack of
[48:53] knowledge that's why they're destroyed
[48:55] that's why the Bible said without a
[48:57] vision we perish it's because without a
[49:00] lack of knowledge now that knowledge
[49:02] that we need amen is the knowledge of
[49:05] what God thought of us that's why Paul
[49:07] said we should pray for knowledge and
[49:08] wisdom and understanding amen do do you
[49:11] see then the very Destiny and origin of
[49:13] the church as Sons without the knowledge
[49:17] of what God has did to redeem you as a
[49:19] son then Satan can prevent you from your
[49:22] Destiny without the knowledge of the
[49:25] word of God Satan can hold you out of
[49:27] your destiny God has Destiny for you to
[49:31] be in the adoption of the church now
[49:33] your destiny speaks of your origin let
[49:35] me just say like this you can't go back
[49:37] to something you was
[49:40] not and Redemption speaks of going back
[49:43] you're not becoming something you wasn't
[49:45] you're going back to what you were is
[49:48] that right amen now watch this if we go
[49:51] into the scripture in Genesis the first
[49:53] chapter let's see the origin of man
[49:55] himself when the human was born in
[49:58] Genesis chapter 1 amen I I don't
[50:00] remember how many times it's multiple
[50:02] times maybe 30 something times within a
[50:04] Sho a few short verses that God has
[50:07] Abraham or Moses writing the Genesis and
[50:10] when he does he uses the word god which
[50:14] is the Hebrew word
[50:16] Elohim Amen brother Ram is very strong
[50:19] on the point that Elohim is
[50:21] self-existent if you take Elohim the the
[50:24] Theologian says it's plural brother bam
[50:26] says if of course not plural in
[50:28] personality but he explains to us that
[50:30] God was plural in attribute is that
[50:33] right then the plurality was attribute
[50:36] or potential that was in God but it took
[50:38] something to open up the attribute or
[50:40] the potential in him was to be a son or
[50:42] to have sons or to redeem Sons but it
[50:45] wasn't until he created man that God
[50:48] took on this attribute when you go from
[50:51] Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 you go in Genesis
[50:54] 2: 7 and you see a change Genesis 2:7
[50:57] says instead of saying God it uses the
[51:00] word the Lord God formed from the dust
[51:02] of the earth when you use the word Lord
[51:05] God brother brandom says the word which
[51:07] means in Hebrew the self-existence all
[51:09] by himself that's what Elohim means God
[51:12] all by himself existed he was all
[51:15] existence therefore he was self-existent
[51:17] when Elohim means all sufficient he said
[51:20] all powerful allmighty self-existent one
[51:23] but in Genesis 2 when he made a man he
[51:26] said I am Jehovah what did it mean it
[51:29] meant the all existent one who has
[51:32] created something off of myself to be a
[51:34] son of mine or a temporary or an amateur
[51:37] little one Jehovah means the word
[51:40] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[51:43] amateur God because he is Father God he
[51:47] made man an amateur God so he isn't
[51:50] self-existent anymore he exists with a
[51:53] family he is Elohim now he is Jehovah
[51:56] meaning the one who exists with a family
[52:00] the one who existed with a family God
[52:03] created for all those days amen but he
[52:05] had nothing like him until he created
[52:08] Adam and when Adam was created God
[52:10] reached perfection in his creation
[52:12] because he had brought himself back into
[52:15] the Earth amen now I I want you to maybe
[52:18] to just stay with me just for a moment
[52:20] in this thought because what we're
[52:22] looking at is is there has a
[52:23] predestination over your life of where
[52:26] you you come from you go back to now
[52:28] think about this because brother
[52:30] brandham is going to say this he's going
[52:32] to say see then we go back to the same
[52:34] Elohim were he self-existent then we
[52:37] come back through Jehovah who me who
[52:39] made something he gave dominion over the
[52:42] Earth and what are we waiting for the
[52:44] manifestations the Earth is groaning let
[52:47] go down and read it predestinated unto
[52:49] the adoption of children to the good
[52:50] pleasure to the praise and the glory of
[52:52] his grace what is Grace back before when
[52:55] he wasn't a father his grace is love he
[52:58] made himself a child that he might be
[53:00] predestinated unto adoption to the
[53:02] praise of his grace where is accepted in
[53:04] the blood which is Christ made us
[53:07] accepted
[53:09] how how do we get into him by one Spirit
[53:12] baptized into him in whom we have
[53:15] Redemption through his blood the
[53:18] Forgiveness of sins now now brother Ram
[53:21] says something here that is just
[53:23] staggering to me how can you preach
[53:27] predestination of God for ordaining and
[53:30] setting unless there's a sin atonement
[53:36] somewhere how can I say that you're
[53:38] going to be somewhere without providing
[53:40] the vehicle to get you
[53:42] there if you're born in sin and shaped
[53:45] into iniquity and I'm prophesying that
[53:48] you're going to return to Dominion ship
[53:51] how could I do that without offering
[53:53] something to get you to where I'm saying
[53:55] you're going to go
[53:57] evidently that you cannot do that or you
[53:59] wouldn't need the Jehovah Gyra but if
[54:02] God has said you would be there God will
[54:04] provide the means to get you there then
[54:07] when you read here brother bam said then
[54:09] we need an atonement now the word
[54:11] atonement is a very powerful word and it
[54:14] would take us a long time to go into it
[54:17] but do can we go into it just a little
[54:19] bit into the word atonement which it's
[54:22] an English word that means it's three
[54:24] words put together at one
[54:27] me so atonement means at one like it was
[54:31] meant
[54:33] atonement it's at one meant now now
[54:37] William tendale is the author of this
[54:39] word it's an English word that was not
[54:42] even in existence until about 15 or
[54:46] 1600 William tendel lived in a time when
[54:49] the Latin was the really the only
[54:52] language that the Bible was preached in
[54:54] the Greek and Hebrew had been translated
[54:56] to Latin and the Romans were using Latin
[54:59] to preach to the church now their
[55:01] translation of the Greek and Hebrew
[55:03] would include words like Roman the Holy
[55:05] Roman Catholic Church they would include
[55:08] words of repentance rather than
[55:10] repentance they would use words like
[55:12] Ecclesiastes instead of church or
[55:14] congregation they they had words amen
[55:17] that would put priests in the place of
[55:20] clergy or Elder amen so what they would
[55:22] do is the words they were using brought
[55:24] the church under the authority of their
[55:27] church instead of the word of God so
[55:30] their translations had direction to it
[55:33] amen and only the priest could read it
[55:35] so the common people could only hear the
[55:37] word through the Latin and one day
[55:39] somebody was talking to William tendale
[55:41] and they said they actually said we
[55:43] would be better off without God's law
[55:46] than the popes and at that time when
[55:48] tendale answered he heard that and he
[55:51] said listen I defy the pope and all of
[55:54] his laws and said if God would spare my
[55:57] life here many years I will cause a boy
[55:59] that driveth a plow shall know more of
[56:02] the scripture than he
[56:04] does it was tend Del's intention that
[56:07] the common man would know more scripture
[56:09] than the pope himself because any person
[56:11] knows the only way to fight amen against
[56:15] the Antichrist is by the word of God
[56:19] Amen so it had to be in a language
[56:21] people could understand so rather than
[56:23] translating it from the Latin to the
[56:25] English Tindale took it from the Greek
[56:28] and Hebrew which he understood Greek and
[56:30] Hebrew and German and he was a he was in
[56:33] a line with Martin Luther so Luther was
[56:35] feeding him ideas can you imagine amen
[56:38] that Luther was giving Tindale ideas of
[56:41] what real atonement was meaning and how
[56:43] that it didn't include the church at all
[56:45] amen and tendale come up with the word
[56:47] atonement because he had no way to put
[56:49] together the idea of what God was doing
[56:52] through the blood of a sacrifice that
[56:54] translated to the blood of Jesus and it
[56:57] would need a word so he used the word at
[56:59] one meant and it became atonement to the
[57:02] to the to the to the world or to us this
[57:05] morning we received the English language
[57:08] of atonement through a man William
[57:10] tendale and I'll say this can you think
[57:12] about this the word of God in your
[57:15] language I don't know if you've ever
[57:16] thought about this but when God speaks
[57:19] nobody could even hear him but when a
[57:21] prophet caught the thought of God and
[57:23] spoke it he spoke it in Aramaic he spoke
[57:25] it in Hebrew he spoke it in Greek but he
[57:28] never spoke it in English but then God
[57:31] translates it to English through Tindale
[57:34] gives us the word of atonement and then
[57:36] here comes a gentile prophet in the end
[57:39] of the age to confirm that the
[57:41] translation that was given us into
[57:43] English was thus sayith the Lord that
[57:47] we're not here with just the ideas of an
[57:49] interpreter like William tendale but we
[57:51] found out that was God giving tendale
[57:54] the interpretation that then a Prophet
[57:56] would take a hold of it and say what
[57:58] atonement means is more than a word he
[58:01] exposed atonement through the
[58:03] manifestation of the word that was given
[58:05] so we then have the language of
[58:07] atonement amen do you know the Roman
[58:09] Church killed killed tendale for that
[58:12] they they killed tendale for it last
[58:14] words he prayed Lord Open the Eyes of
[58:16] the king of
[58:17] England amen do you see what tend Del's
[58:19] first use use of the word the of the
[58:22] word atonement is in 1526 in translation
[58:25] of the New Testament
[58:27] so it's not until 1500s the word of
[58:29] atonement so the language of atonement
[58:31] if you say the language of atonement
[58:32] you're talking about escapegoat the word
[58:35] scapegoat come from tendale the word
[58:38] Passover came from tendale the word
[58:40] atonement came from pendel because he
[58:42] was giving us the language of atonement
[58:45] to express what the scriptures were
[58:47] trying to say in the English language so
[58:50] the language of atonement would
[58:51] translate to the to the bride of Christ
[58:53] for the purpose of preaching atonement
[58:56] it see you can't preach something till
[58:58] it's in your
[58:59] language you can't say it until it's
[59:03] understandable but when God gave this
[59:05] translation he was making the preaching
[59:07] of the atonement come into our language
[59:10] now in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and you
[59:12] go to the 18th verse here's another
[59:14] beautiful point that the translations
[59:17] they now they covered up tend Dales in
[59:18] the King James but originally when
[59:20] tendale did this one it was written like
[59:22] this all things are of God who hath
[59:24] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[59:27] and have given to us the ministry of
[59:29] reconciliation those two words
[59:31] reconciled and Reconciliation existed in
[59:33] tendil as
[59:35] atonement so instead of saying the
[59:37] ministry of reconciliation he said the
[59:40] preaching of the
[59:42] atonement can you imagine that God
[59:45] through Christ was atoning us to himself
[59:48] that's what God was doing through Jesus
[59:51] Jesus's job was to atone us to him
[59:54] through God and then he in turn gave us
[59:57] the preaching of that
[59:59] atonement that we could join others unto
[1:00:02] God so the preaching of the atonement
[1:00:05] now this atonement that we're talking
[1:00:07] about amen is found in Hebrews chapter 9
[1:00:10] and the 12th verse amen having obtained
[1:00:12] an eternal Redemption for us the
[1:00:16] Deliverance that brought us a blood
[1:00:17] shedding the price has been paid amen
[1:00:20] see what it is it's a Deliverance that
[1:00:21] is brought by a blood
[1:00:24] shedding amen can you think about this
[1:00:27] now preaching atonement means a
[1:00:29] Deliverance was brought to us by Blood
[1:00:32] shedding that's the doctrine of
[1:00:34] atonement the shedding of blood brought
[1:00:37] Deliverance the shedding of blood
[1:00:39] brought our freedom the shedding of
[1:00:41] blood bought our at one back with God or
[1:00:47] reconciliation it obtained an eternal
[1:00:50] Redemption he said not just from one
[1:00:53] place to another Eternal Redemption he
[1:00:55] said that's
[1:00:57] Eternal amen and he went to Ephesians 4
[1:00:59] and said sealed until the day of
[1:01:01] redemption according to scripture in 1
[1:01:03] Peter chapter 1 and verse 18 Again
[1:01:06] tendale uses the same word atonement
[1:01:09] amen here and watch what he says for as
[1:01:11] much as you know that you were not
[1:01:12] redeemed with corruptible things of
[1:01:14] silver and gold your vain conversation
[1:01:17] received by tradition from your fathers
[1:01:19] the word redeemed is the word atoned or
[1:01:21] the word
[1:01:23] ransomed you were not ransomed now in
[1:01:26] the Old Testament uh y'all know that
[1:01:28] that the firstborn had a ransom to pay
[1:01:30] they had to count the heads of of the of
[1:01:33] the of the young men I believe everybody
[1:01:34] over the age of 18 and remember they
[1:01:36] bring them to a high priest and he would
[1:01:38] evaluate or estimate the price of the
[1:01:41] soul and then you would have to pay into
[1:01:43] the sanctuary amount of so or silver for
[1:01:46] The Ransom of that Soul Peter knew the
[1:01:49] tradition that Moses had instated that
[1:01:51] you paid the money for The Ransom of the
[1:01:53] soul but when Peter was preaching in the
[1:01:56] New Testament he said this is not
[1:01:58] through silver and gold but you are
[1:02:00] ransomed by the precious blood of Jesus
[1:02:03] Christ so Peter was preaching atonement
[1:02:06] to the church not Redemption through
[1:02:09] money not Redemption through lamb but
[1:02:12] Redemption Through
[1:02:13] Blood he was preaching atonement now
[1:02:16] it's amazing because atonement don't
[1:02:18] only mean to bring back it also uses the
[1:02:21] Hebrew word CER which actually means to
[1:02:23] cover over now brother B brings this one
[1:02:27] out in the message of the Ark in Genesis
[1:02:29] chapter 6 and verse1 14 amen the
[1:02:31] scripture when God is telling Abra or
[1:02:33] Noah how to build the ark he said make
[1:02:35] thee an ark of goph for wood rooms thou
[1:02:37] shal make in the ark and thou shalt
[1:02:39] pitch it within and without with pitch
[1:02:42] Thou shalt pitch it the word in Hebrew
[1:02:44] is caer amen it's it it's it's it's it's
[1:02:47] actually meaning is to cover the wood
[1:02:50] amen this word is to atone brother B
[1:02:53] said what they used is a word pitch but
[1:02:55] but it really means to atone now the
[1:02:58] word atone means to cover over hey you
[1:03:01] remember brother Bram said they cut down
[1:03:03] the the the gopher wood which was easily
[1:03:05] soaked in things right he said they cut
[1:03:07] down the gopher wood but then God by
[1:03:09] wisdom told him to pitch it or to cover
[1:03:11] it that this wood would need a covering
[1:03:14] speaking of humanity as trees that we
[1:03:18] would need a covering so we wouldn't
[1:03:20] soak in the devil but we could resist
[1:03:23] the judgments that come upon the Earth
[1:03:25] is that right to atone the wood to cover
[1:03:29] the wood you had to cut down a tree take
[1:03:32] the life the sap out of the tree it went
[1:03:35] through a process that through the heat
[1:03:38] then the sap was reapplied to the wood
[1:03:40] of Noah and brother Bram said encased it
[1:03:43] like
[1:03:44] steel it was covered he said to act as a
[1:03:47] covering from the Judgment Waters so it
[1:03:50] was there it's not only for Redemption
[1:03:53] but atonement also speaks of covering I
[1:03:56] hope you're hearing me now so it's what
[1:03:58] was typed in Noah as a covering that the
[1:04:02] Bible is preaching the blood is not only
[1:04:05] redeeming you back to God he is covering
[1:04:08] you from the judgments of God so it
[1:04:11] would be one thing to be redeemed back
[1:04:12] but then you'd still be
[1:04:15] you you still got mistakes and trials
[1:04:17] and problems and issues you got all
[1:04:19] these things going on but the preaching
[1:04:21] of the atonement will tell you that the
[1:04:24] same blood that brings you back to God
[1:04:27] it's the same blood that covers you in
[1:04:30] the presence of God so as that you are
[1:04:33] encased in the steel of God Amen I I
[1:04:36] tell you there's another type brother
[1:04:37] ROM uses from the message the ark and he
[1:04:39] comes in he says watching how Moses went
[1:04:41] into the ark and he build in the holies
[1:04:43] of holies he built a Ark of the Covenant
[1:04:46] out of it was Cas of wood I believe it
[1:04:48] was and he buildt it out of wood but he
[1:04:50] overlaid it with
[1:04:53] gold so deity covered the
[1:04:57] wood deity covered the wood so the blood
[1:05:01] that would cover the church would not
[1:05:04] just be the blood of a human the church
[1:05:07] is not covered by human blood the church
[1:05:10] is covered by deity by the blood of
[1:05:13] almighty God my who could touch that
[1:05:16] kind of blood who could come into that
[1:05:18] kind of place who could see past that
[1:05:21] kind of blood now in Leviticus 16 the
[1:05:24] day of atonement from the language of
[1:05:25] atonement let's just take the day of
[1:05:27] atonement it would happen on the 10th
[1:05:29] day in the seventh
[1:05:33] month let that and settle in a minute
[1:05:36] I'm talking too fast you're missing the
[1:05:41] points the I know you
[1:05:44] did Brother Ray quick the 10th day in
[1:05:48] the seventh
[1:05:53] month anybody else
[1:05:58] Tyler got
[1:06:00] it the 10th day in the seventh month was
[1:06:04] the day of atonement remember the day of
[1:06:06] atonement that they would go and take
[1:06:08] two
[1:06:09] goats and they would kill one goat and
[1:06:11] take the blood of that Goat as an
[1:06:13] atonement for the sin of the
[1:06:15] people but then they had a second action
[1:06:18] that they would take that blood and put
[1:06:20] it on a living goat and then the living
[1:06:23] goat would carry the sins of Israel of
[1:06:27] that whole year and would pack it out in
[1:06:29] the
[1:06:30] wilderness so brother bandam says see
[1:06:33] two goats both represented Christ for
[1:06:35] years I couldn't get that why it took
[1:06:37] two goats but see goats can't resurrect
[1:06:39] themselves so it took a goat to die for
[1:06:42] the blood to shed the blood for our sins
[1:06:45] but it took another goat to represent
[1:06:47] that the sins were carried away so the
[1:06:50] shedding of the blood Carried Away The
[1:06:52] Sins of Israel it didn't just C the
[1:06:55] blood of the sins it Carried Away The
[1:06:59] Sins do you see God redeems you by the
[1:07:02] blood God covers you by the blood and
[1:07:05] then God takes the sins away it's not
[1:07:08] just an atonement where like okay amen
[1:07:10] God gives us atonement then we got to
[1:07:12] fend for ourselves the rest of our life
[1:07:14] but the atonement he gave us it paid the
[1:07:16] price of our Ransom it covered us with
[1:07:19] power and then it carried away our sins
[1:07:23] as the Bible said as far as the the East
[1:07:26] is from the West I tell you that's
[1:07:28] pretty far the east from the West that's
[1:07:31] how far that God carried your sins so
[1:07:34] everybody Amen in the denominational
[1:07:36] World likes to say this scapegoat was
[1:07:37] the devil that God put the sins on the
[1:07:39] devil the devil carried man said
[1:07:41] absolutely not he said the devil would
[1:07:43] carry them out and turn around and bring
[1:07:45] them back he said he's an ending Giver
[1:07:47] he would trade on you he'd take them
[1:07:49] he'd carry them then he' bring them back
[1:07:51] he said but when Jesus took your sins
[1:07:54] when Jesus takes the sins of the church
[1:07:57] they are taken away and they can never
[1:08:00] return back to the church could you
[1:08:03] imagine this that God could take
[1:08:05] something out of your life and it will
[1:08:08] never return
[1:08:12] again say oh preacher the what in the
[1:08:14] world happened to it I I think it's a
[1:08:16] powerful question that the goat could
[1:08:18] carry Away The Sins that the day of
[1:08:20] atonement that it could carry it away
[1:08:22] now here's the powerful thing this day
[1:08:24] of atonement on the 10th day in the
[1:08:26] seventh month amen it fell every year
[1:08:28] but every seven years was a Sabbath
[1:08:31] still atonement and every seven seven
[1:08:34] years were 49 years and the next year
[1:08:36] after 49 the day of atonement become a
[1:08:39] jubilee trumpet atonement so on the 10th
[1:08:42] day in the seventh month on the 50th day
[1:08:45] of atonement that atonement was a
[1:08:47] jubilee atonement and they would take
[1:08:50] the sounds of a trumpet and blow
[1:08:53] throughout the land that this atonement
[1:08:56] don't only cover it don't only take you
[1:08:58] away but it gives you back everything
[1:09:01] that you have lost over the last 50
[1:09:04] years do you see all of the different
[1:09:07] festivals they had around the atonement
[1:09:09] was only speaking of that one power of
[1:09:12] the blood it would cover it would
[1:09:14] scatter sin it would give back the
[1:09:16] church everything that he had lost in
[1:09:19] the Years of Slavery and sin I tell you
[1:09:22] this at Rams Horn they blew amen was was
[1:09:25] actually blew on the day of atonement
[1:09:27] which was a jubilee trumpet and under
[1:09:29] that trumpet it actually spoke the
[1:09:31] trumpet said something the sound of the
[1:09:33] trumpet meant that you could return now
[1:09:36] I'm going to preach on the Jubilee I
[1:09:37] want to get in your mind the Jubilee was
[1:09:39] what they would restore or return back
[1:09:42] to everything that had been lost do you
[1:09:44] see church I'm not saying that the bride
[1:09:47] of Christ is going to possess something
[1:09:49] that belongs to somebody else I'm saying
[1:09:52] that you're not taking something of
[1:09:54] brother Brams or Moses's or Paul's or
[1:09:56] James or John's I'm saying God from the
[1:09:59] beginning intended for you to possess
[1:10:01] this land from the beginning it was in
[1:10:04] God's mind to take you the destitute the
[1:10:07] residue the lower parts and to lift them
[1:10:10] to the place that they could possess
[1:10:13] this land and God would do it by the
[1:10:15] power of an atonement to show the world
[1:10:18] my atonement is more
[1:10:20] powerful my
[1:10:22] goodness come on I'm not I'm not on a
[1:10:24] I'm not on a the wild goose chase I want
[1:10:26] you to see it this was a day of a year
[1:10:29] of 50 years and they could return
[1:10:31] sounded by a Rams Horn the Rams Horn had
[1:10:33] no voice of its own it was a wind
[1:10:35] instrument amen and it was a
[1:10:39] ram it was a ram are you with me Genesis
[1:10:44] 22 that was a ram it was a Ram's Horn
[1:10:46] that was hung in a Thicket and here we
[1:10:48] are on the day of atonement with a Rams
[1:10:50] Horn saying to the church that
[1:10:53] everything that you've lost has have
[1:10:55] been restored and people say how can we
[1:10:58] go back home theyd say there's been an
[1:11:00] atonement made you didn't see the
[1:11:02] atonement you didn't see the blood you
[1:11:05] didn't see the cross you wasn't standing
[1:11:07] there when the high priest did it but
[1:11:09] you heard the sound of the atonement
[1:11:11] through the horn and that was the same
[1:11:14] as seeing the
[1:11:15] blood my Lord when you hear the gospel
[1:11:20] in the last Church age this is the Ram's
[1:11:22] Horn the manifested word of God God is
[1:11:26] now saying to the church that all that
[1:11:29] we have lost all that has been taken
[1:11:32] away God has come to restore to the
[1:11:35] church by virtue of the atoning blood of
[1:11:39] Jesus Christ it won't be because you
[1:11:41] earned it it won't be because you're a
[1:11:43] good boy it won't be because you're
[1:11:45] better than somebody else this will be
[1:11:47] because God before the world ever began
[1:11:50] ordained you to prophesy over this age
[1:11:54] by the spirit of God
[1:11:59] my come on Church y'all know you know
[1:12:02] there's a transition you you Bible
[1:12:04] students probably and I've preached it a
[1:12:06] couple times I don't want to get I don't
[1:12:07] want to get over booking on this point
[1:12:09] but but Jesus said in Luke 4 for the
[1:12:11] spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach
[1:12:13] the acceptable year of the Lord the day
[1:12:16] of atonement on the 50th year was the
[1:12:18] acceptable day and Jesus said the spirit
[1:12:21] of the Lord is on me to preach this from
[1:12:24] the day before that in all other days
[1:12:28] atonement was announced by the sounding
[1:12:30] of Ram's Horn but now the manifested
[1:12:34] word of Isaiah 7 Isaiah 9 Genesis 3 was
[1:12:38] now preaching the word of redemption to
[1:12:41] the church and it was a
[1:12:44] jubilee so from that day forward the
[1:12:47] Jubilee would not be announced by Ram's
[1:12:49] horns it would be announced by gospel
[1:12:51] preaching
[1:12:55] I tell you if I was a devil I'd try to
[1:12:57] keep keep you from preaching
[1:13:00] too sure I'd try to get all the
[1:13:03] preachers disappointed all them to sit
[1:13:05] down quit studying the message quit
[1:13:06] reading the books I do my best because
[1:13:09] listen if a preacher that's got a gift
[1:13:10] in his life gets to studying this
[1:13:12] message you won't shut him
[1:13:15] up because it's the 10th day of the
[1:13:17] seventh month and we're sounding under
[1:13:19] the seventh Angel's message and it's not
[1:13:22] just the trumpet has blew but it's
[1:13:24] blowing again through pastors and
[1:13:26] teachers and evangelists and apostles
[1:13:29] and they're sounding Out a sound what's
[1:13:32] the sound church that the bride has been
[1:13:34] redeemed and atoned by the blood of
[1:13:37] Jesus
[1:13:38] Christ my you'll never get this
[1:13:41] possession by your abilities it's what
[1:13:43] God did for you I tell you brother bam
[1:13:46] said in the 10 virgins he said this the
[1:13:48] trumpet sounded and you can go free it's
[1:13:50] the grace of God it's the Jubilee the
[1:13:52] completion of the day of sin is over I
[1:13:54] tell you everyone serving T sin tape or
[1:13:58] visible audience everyone that serving
[1:13:59] sin the day of sin is over that's one of
[1:14:02] my favorite quotes I'm sure you heard it
[1:14:03] more than once the day of sin is
[1:14:08] over so the seven seal does end all
[1:14:12] things amen you see what in the mind of
[1:14:16] God he was having the blood atonement
[1:14:19] all the time that was always his plan
[1:14:22] but in the symbol of a lamb it was so
[1:14:25] weak they had to do it every
[1:14:27] year the weakness of the symbol was an
[1:14:30] every year atonement they had to keep
[1:14:32] doing it and doing it and doing it and
[1:14:34] doing it but it was in weakness they
[1:14:37] were doing it it would not take away sin
[1:14:40] it was only a type somebody was going to
[1:14:42] do it but in the weakness of that
[1:14:44] atonement Moses created flies and freeze
[1:14:47] and frogs in the weakness of that
[1:14:50] atonement Joshua stopped the son oh God
[1:14:55] church if them men had that kind of
[1:14:57] power under the weakness of the
[1:14:59] atonement of an animal what about the
[1:15:02] Church of the Living God under the
[1:15:04] precious blood of Jesus Christ which is
[1:15:07] not the blood of a man it's the blood of
[1:15:10] God I know Satan's trying to keep you
[1:15:12] through it from it but the preaching of
[1:15:14] the word of God would tell you that we
[1:15:16] have a high priest this morning that's
[1:15:18] not offering the blood of bulls and
[1:15:19] goats he's not entering into Moses's
[1:15:22] Tabernacle he's not going every year but
[1:15:25] the Bible tells us that Paul told us
[1:15:27] this that our high priest is
[1:15:29] meaned and he entered into the heavens
[1:15:32] of Heavens to atone by the blood of
[1:15:35] Jesus one time for everybody so I me
[1:15:39] tell you this the atonement is not going
[1:15:41] to be done
[1:15:42] again it's not going to be another
[1:15:44] shedding of the blood it's not going to
[1:15:47] be another sacrifice given on your
[1:15:49] behalf whatever God did it's did
[1:15:52] whatever God did it's already done the
[1:15:55] only thing left for the church is by the
[1:15:57] preaching of the atoning word and it
[1:16:00] would open up an entrance to every
[1:16:02] believer to believe that the grace of
[1:16:05] God has covered us that the power of God
[1:16:07] has set us at Liberty to restore us back
[1:16:10] to everything that has been lost I'll
[1:16:13] tell you this amen I I was reading here
[1:16:16] yesterday the day before and this this
[1:16:19] kept coming into me I don't know I I I
[1:16:21] can't I can't figure out if it's
[1:16:22] something from my distant memory or if
[1:16:25] it's something the Lord is speaking to
[1:16:26] me but I could just hear something
[1:16:27] saying to me but this
[1:16:30] blood but this blood but this blood and
[1:16:35] I keep thinking but this blood do you
[1:16:37] see what happened Jesus the Bible said
[1:16:40] but this man Jesus this man not any high
[1:16:43] priest this man with this Blood amen
[1:16:47] it's a special man with a special blood
[1:16:50] this Blood this blood is A different
[1:16:52] kind of blood this blood is not the
[1:16:54] blood of your fathers or the blood of
[1:16:57] bulls or blood of goats it is the blood
[1:16:59] of God that was shed to atone the church
[1:17:02] back to everything that was lost this
[1:17:06] Blood this Blood was put
[1:17:09] forth once and for all in Revelation
[1:17:12] chap 1 and verse 5 it is spoken said
[1:17:15] that unto him that loved us washed us
[1:17:17] from our sins in his own
[1:17:20] blood my goodness in his own blood
[1:17:25] the word wash actually means the word
[1:17:28] loosed he loosed us from our sins by his
[1:17:33] own blood I tell you people say to me
[1:17:36] all times Well when you getting pretty
[1:17:37] loose well if you start reading what I'm
[1:17:39] reading you'll get pretty loose
[1:17:41] too CU what you're going to find out is
[1:17:43] there's nothing holding you you're going
[1:17:45] to find out that's why they call this
[1:17:47] the astronaut Age We Have Nothing
[1:17:50] holding us we have no sins no bondage no
[1:17:53] degrees no dogmas no Creeds no problems
[1:17:56] we have been blasted into a bright age
[1:17:58] by a bright manifestation an astronaut
[1:18:01] age an eagle age of people and have Cut
[1:18:05] Loose they have Cut Loose God cut them
[1:18:08] loose that they can believe for the
[1:18:10] impossible you said preacher how loose
[1:18:13] are you let me tell you what brother
[1:18:14] brandom said he said consider this that
[1:18:16] it's the blood of God and it's a perfect
[1:18:18] blood now you consider that it's a blood
[1:18:21] of God and it's a perfect blood he said
[1:18:23] then the perfect blood is loosing us
[1:18:25] from the power and bondage and
[1:18:28] defilement of sin then the loosing is
[1:18:30] perfect and it is
[1:18:33] complete then you're sitting here this
[1:18:35] morning wanting to be free from
[1:18:37] something and I can tell you you're
[1:18:39] already loose from it I can tell you
[1:18:42] it's already complete it's already a
[1:18:44] finished work you don't need loose you
[1:18:46] need to hear the preaching of the
[1:18:49] atoning power of the blood of Jesus
[1:18:52] Christ that'll set a man at Liberty who
[1:18:55] was bound in Che in Chains of
[1:18:57] misunderstandings I'll tell you what
[1:18:59] amen I'll tell you this there is a blood
[1:19:02] this morning there is a power this
[1:19:03] morning that can loose a man and when
[1:19:06] he's loosed he is perfectly
[1:19:10] loosed for who the son is set free he is
[1:19:13] free not just a little free he's all the
[1:19:16] way free he's totally free he's totally
[1:19:19] delivered that was totally the blood of
[1:19:22] God so we're totally free this morning
[1:19:24] to believe every promise that God has
[1:19:27] made upon the church this man Jesus was
[1:19:30] not an ordinary
[1:19:32] man come on that baby of Mary was not an
[1:19:35] ordinary
[1:19:36] baby you can walk up to about anybody
[1:19:38] and ask them the question why the Virgin
[1:19:40] birth almost nobody in denomination
[1:19:42] world could tell you why the Virgin
[1:19:44] birth they honestly can't I asked some
[1:19:45] people just walked up in the Starbucks
[1:19:47] and said why the Virgin birth one lady
[1:19:49] said well it's in it's because I believe
[1:19:50] the word another woman said well I don't
[1:19:52] know I just believe it in my heart and I
[1:19:54] thought you mean to tell me that's as
[1:19:56] substantial of an argument you have with
[1:19:57] a
[1:19:59] devil that's that's as far as your
[1:20:01] argument goes with the devil but let me
[1:20:03] tell you what the Bible said that that
[1:20:05] the children of God were living perfect
[1:20:07] in heaven and Satan entered in and by
[1:20:09] reason he pulled them out of perfection
[1:20:12] into sin and when God heard about it
[1:20:15] when the Angels told God your children
[1:20:17] have failed brother BR said God run
[1:20:19] through didn't send an angel he said he
[1:20:22] ran through himself hunting his Lost
[1:20:25] Child crying Adam Adam he said a crisis
[1:20:29] had to have a conference and in the Eden
[1:20:32] conference God had to make a quick
[1:20:34] decision he said that would be an
[1:20:36] eternal decision he said we're going to
[1:20:38] use the blood he said and then he took
[1:20:41] the skins of those sheep and wrapped
[1:20:44] Adam and Eve in those sheep skins
[1:20:47] remember and when he wrapped them he
[1:20:49] atoned them or covered them from the
[1:20:51] Judgment of God and then prophesy God
[1:20:55] then he prophesied over them bloody
[1:20:57] sheep skins and he said the woman's seed
[1:21:00] and the serpent seed shall be enity
[1:21:03] between thy seeds for the seed of the
[1:21:05] woman shall bruise the head of the
[1:21:07] serpent brother let me tell you when
[1:21:09] this Bible begin to prophesy amen there
[1:21:11] was a serpent seed that was trying to
[1:21:14] destroy you trying to take your position
[1:21:17] he was trying to destroy your lives but
[1:21:20] Jesus the woman's seed was sent to undo
[1:21:23] everything the devil did who would have
[1:21:26] knew that that little baby would be the
[1:21:28] one that would stop the head of the
[1:21:31] devil he would actually bruise the head
[1:21:33] of serpents and bring them into the
[1:21:35] great subjection of almighty God my when
[1:21:38] I think about this then therefore that
[1:21:40] woman seed it's spoken over there in
[1:21:42] Jeremiah that a woman shall Compass
[1:21:44] about a man am sure Pentecost do use
[1:21:46] that for women preachers it was
[1:21:48] prophesied that a woman would have a
[1:21:50] child without a man that there would
[1:21:52] come into the Earth a new thing
[1:21:56] come on
[1:21:57] now you know in the Book of Matthew when
[1:22:00] they Angel met her said thou shallal
[1:22:01] conceive and have a child for a virgin
[1:22:04] shall conceive is that right a virgin
[1:22:06] shall
[1:22:07] conceive don't have time to go into it a
[1:22:10] virgin shall conceive and and watch the
[1:22:12] Catholics get a hold of that Doctrine
[1:22:15] and call it Immaculate Conception you
[1:22:16] got to be careful what you agree with
[1:22:18] because what they believe is they
[1:22:20] believe that Mary conceived of the Holy
[1:22:22] Ghost same way as you but they believe
[1:22:24] it was the blood of God but they believe
[1:22:26] that the egg come from Mary and they
[1:22:28] also believe to do that Mary had to be
[1:22:30] virgin
[1:22:33] born so the Immaculate Conception
[1:22:35] includes Mary as virgin born then you
[1:22:38] can see brother bram's teaching on seed
[1:22:40] not air with the shook showing you that
[1:22:43] Abraham's seed was not Ishmael Isaac but
[1:22:45] it was Jesus he said do you see it then
[1:22:48] do you see that Ishmael was a slightly
[1:22:50] doubted promise do you see that Sarah
[1:22:53] had the baby by promise but by sex but
[1:22:57] when Mary had the baby she had Abraham's
[1:23:01] baby without sex by
[1:23:05] promise come on Church Mary had Eve's
[1:23:08] baby Mary had Abraham's baby it was
[1:23:11] Christ Our Lord that came into the womb
[1:23:14] it was both male and female God created
[1:23:17] into that womb the egg and the sperm
[1:23:19] amen and God so created the body you
[1:23:21] don't think God don't know what he's
[1:23:23] doing before you ever fail before the
[1:23:25] fall in the in the garden Eve was
[1:23:27] already created was she not come on now
[1:23:29] I'm I'm not a doctor but I I pray that
[1:23:31] I've got this close enough to get past
[1:23:33] the doctors in the
[1:23:34] building but do you know that the the
[1:23:37] blood the blood of a woman does not mix
[1:23:40] with the blood of her
[1:23:41] baby if it does there's some major
[1:23:43] trouble going on it's it's a it's a
[1:23:46] tragic thing if it starts mixing but God
[1:23:48] designed that a woman could carry a baby
[1:23:51] without its Bloods mixing together
[1:23:53] because God knew that he would use the
[1:23:55] womb of a woman to bring his own blood
[1:23:58] into the Earth that God could bypass
[1:24:00] humanity and bring the blood upon the
[1:24:03] Earth to destroy sin God set this up so
[1:24:07] as you would be the blood of God in the
[1:24:10] last come on
[1:24:14] Church Mary was Pentecost you are the
[1:24:18] Virgin
[1:24:21] word come on justification was slightly
[1:24:24] down and sanctification what about the
[1:24:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost brother man
[1:24:27] said but Mary represented the husk but
[1:24:31] out of the husk come a seed out of there
[1:24:33] came a virgin word and we bypassed the
[1:24:36] entire
[1:24:38] church then Pentecost could carry
[1:24:41] you without mixing its life with your
[1:24:44] life and you could take God's life and
[1:24:46] come out of this
[1:24:52] age oh we're going to get into something
[1:24:55] right here right
[1:24:56] now couple minutes we're going to go
[1:24:58] don't don't get too don't get too
[1:25:01] excited in case there was no male the
[1:25:04] life in this Blood had to come from God
[1:25:05] alone and he created this blo blood cell
[1:25:08] in the womb of Mary God himself the
[1:25:11] Creator himself created a blood
[1:25:14] cell he created both egg and
[1:25:19] blood that was God creating an
[1:25:23] atonement there was nothing that could
[1:25:26] eradicate sin that could destroy sin
[1:25:29] that could remove it that could cover
[1:25:31] the church that could put you back so
[1:25:33] God created something that
[1:25:39] could that's the scripture I'm bypassing
[1:25:42] hundreds of scriptures y'all forgive me
[1:25:43] I'm just giving you the point the
[1:25:45] investment in Chicago brother Ram said
[1:25:48] it like this but God in his creative
[1:25:50] created a blood cell without sexual
[1:25:53] desire in the womb of the Virgin that
[1:25:55] don't only cover sin it omits it it
[1:25:58] takes it so far till it's not even in
[1:26:00] the mind of God again it don't make a
[1:26:03] bridge across the chasm it moves the
[1:26:07] chasm this drop of ink into a bottle of
[1:26:11] bleach whatever it might be you will
[1:26:13] never find that color again you drop BL
[1:26:16] your sins into the powerful creative
[1:26:20] blood of Jesus Christ the preaching of
[1:26:23] atonement tells me that it's the only
[1:26:26] place you can put sin that it can never
[1:26:28] come back
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:33] again I was thinking about it this
[1:26:35] morning what happens to it when you put
[1:26:37] it if you put it under the blood what
[1:26:38] happens to it young people I hope you're
[1:26:40] listening to me real
[1:26:42] close what happens to it after you put
[1:26:44] it under the blood the prophet said it
[1:26:46] omits it it takes it away the preaching
[1:26:50] of atonement says to us there is a place
[1:26:52] that you can confess your sin and it
[1:26:54] will never return to you again that it
[1:26:57] will never come back up again do you
[1:26:59] know that you can confess your sin to
[1:27:01] Jesus Christ and he said he is faithful
[1:27:03] and just to forgive you confess sin
[1:27:07] dropped into the blood there is now no
[1:27:10] more remembrance of that
[1:27:12] sin you get in trouble you're wondering
[1:27:15] what to do with it I can tell you bring
[1:27:17] it under the blood you're wondering how
[1:27:19] can I live the rest of my life with what
[1:27:21] I did bringing under the blood you can
[1:27:24] bring it under the blood and God forgets
[1:27:26] about it amen God hides it from his own
[1:27:29] presence he obliterated he covered it he
[1:27:32] sets you back by it what is it it's the
[1:27:35] coloring he said the coloring of sin
[1:27:37] goes back through the mediators now
[1:27:39] watch this and down through time until
[1:27:40] it hits the accuser so what happens to
[1:27:42] it when you good now brother R shows us
[1:27:44] in the scapegoat that Jesus carries the
[1:27:46] sin away but where does he carry to what
[1:27:49] happens to it brother Bram said he knows
[1:27:51] the originator of it so it goes back to
[1:27:55] the original before it ever came to you
[1:27:58] it goes back to the head of Satan our
[1:28:01] accuser so the blood has the power for
[1:28:04] Jesus to take the sin off of your life
[1:28:08] and make the devil pay for that sin in
[1:28:10] the fiery tribulations of the Lake of
[1:28:13] Fire I tell you God annihilates Satan he
[1:28:16] annihilates sin sin is done away with
[1:28:19] because the bride will live in Eternal
[1:28:23] Redemption under the power of the
[1:28:29] atonement we got just a few minutes of
[1:28:31] patience this
[1:28:33] morning what happens to it he becomes in
[1:28:36] perfect fellowship with the father again
[1:28:37] standing on the other side of the
[1:28:40] chasm now somebody somebody here this
[1:28:43] morning needs to hear these
[1:28:45] quotes I assure you I'm not reading them
[1:28:49] just to read
[1:28:52] them there's no more stain of bleach can
[1:28:56] be seen anywhere he's
[1:28:58] free just that Clorox or the ink that
[1:29:02] can never be ink no more because it's
[1:29:05] been broke up and set back again when
[1:29:09] confessed sin is dipped in a man or a
[1:29:11] woman that's been dipped into the blood
[1:29:12] of Christ it kills all
[1:29:16] symptoms every molecule of sin goes back
[1:29:19] to the devil laid on him to the day of
[1:29:21] judgment where his eternal destination
[1:29:22] will be throwed into the lake a
[1:29:25] fire my goodness the chasm bridged and
[1:29:29] can never come into remembrance
[1:29:34] again brother Wayne it's simple brother
[1:29:37] Bram said don't you stumble over
[1:29:40] Simplicity if the blood of bulls and
[1:29:41] goats are used for a bleach which can
[1:29:44] only cover but put a man in position to
[1:29:46] speak a creative word why would you
[1:29:49] stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ's
[1:29:51] blood who could speak a squirrel or
[1:29:53] something into to existence don't
[1:29:56] stumble over
[1:29:59] Simplicity God hiding himself in
[1:30:01] Simplicity remember the blood of Jesus
[1:30:03] Christ takes sin so far from
[1:30:07] you until it's not in the remembrance of
[1:30:12] God
[1:30:18] anymore preacher what are you doing it's
[1:30:20] the preaching of the atonement
[1:30:24] I sat and read these quotes in my
[1:30:26] study and every time I read one I felt
[1:30:29] myself get
[1:30:31] lighter I thought you know what I've
[1:30:33] read these quotes but it's been a while
[1:30:36] and every time I read one I got
[1:30:39] lighter I felt lighter I felt I felt
[1:30:44] Freer the blood stands between God and
[1:30:47] me I accept it I'm a sinner but he's God
[1:30:53] but the Ministry stands between me the
[1:30:55] kill of sin so God sees me just as white
[1:30:59] see it's it's in the bleach sin is
[1:31:03] gone it can't even reach him because
[1:31:07] there's a sacrifice laying
[1:31:12] there now can you imagine the next
[1:31:15] time that you feel empowered of God to
[1:31:19] do something for the Lord and Satan
[1:31:22] begins to accuse you
[1:31:25] you if you remember the knowledge of
[1:31:28] this word right
[1:31:30] here look at what you could say to
[1:31:34] Satan he can't even see it
[1:31:41] Satan can you
[1:31:44] imagine you're perfected in a sacrifice
[1:31:47] now brother man said he explains this
[1:31:48] the way you the way we feel on a daily
[1:31:51] basis you're perfected with our
[1:31:53] sacrifice he makes no mistakes he
[1:31:55] wouldn't bring you in if you wasn't
[1:32:00] worthy he knows your heart yeah that's
[1:32:03] right he knows what you are right he
[1:32:06] knows your motives he knows what you are
[1:32:10] but there's traps all along the road and
[1:32:14] the devil will cause you to stumble and
[1:32:16] you'll say I didn't mean to do that
[1:32:18] God he said see but you're still perfect
[1:32:24] because there's a perfect blood offered
[1:32:26] for you every day a bleeding sacrifice
[1:32:30] hanging Before the Throne of the
[1:32:32] almighty God
[1:32:36] hallu hallelujah thank now what are we
[1:32:39] talking
[1:32:41] about that when you come under the blood
[1:32:43] you're not a sinner
[1:32:46] anymore
[1:32:48] right when we come into it Lord there we
[1:32:51] are with no sin and not in our ourselves
[1:32:54] we were all
[1:32:57] Sinners watch brother brandom we're all
[1:33:00] Sinners but in you we are not
[1:33:04] Sinners we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:33:09] God in the seven seal when our sins are
[1:33:12] confessed it's put in the blood of
[1:33:13] Christ they'll never be known again God
[1:33:15] forgets them they never was even done as
[1:33:19] long as the sacrifice of the atonement
[1:33:21] is there for us that's it see we're not
[1:33:24] Sinners no more we're Christians by the
[1:33:27] grace of
[1:33:28] God but remember in our own selves we'd
[1:33:32] probably be just as bad as we ever
[1:33:39] were oh then you're not an
[1:33:46] angel do you know you're never going to
[1:33:48] be an
[1:33:50] angel because you never were an angel
[1:33:55] you always were a son or a daughter of
[1:34:00] God you say well I think well I'm a
[1:34:03] sinner I'm not
[1:34:04] him brother Ram said but I've come to
[1:34:07] represent him and remember me being a
[1:34:09] sinner and before God I'm not a sinner
[1:34:12] and neither are you we've got a blood
[1:34:16] sacrifice laying there and God don't
[1:34:18] even see us he hears our voice but he
[1:34:21] sees the blood of Christ Christ it's our
[1:34:25] voice but it's Christ's blood then it's
[1:34:28] Christ talking through us to
[1:34:31] God therefore we are not Sinners anymore
[1:34:34] we are
[1:34:38] Christians it's brother Bram I make so
[1:34:40] many
[1:34:41] mistakes but that's why Christ had to
[1:34:44] die with your mistakes wouldn't be
[1:34:47] lotted to you he took your mistakes your
[1:34:50] desire in your hearts to serve him
[1:34:52] that's what he died for so you could
[1:34:54] serve him your mistakes are not looked
[1:35:00] at word Prophet here Church your
[1:35:03] mistakes are not looked at they are not
[1:35:05] lotted to you he is our propitiation he
[1:35:09] is our sin offering your sins are not
[1:35:14] known you're not a sinner before God
[1:35:17] Christ took your sins and became you
[1:35:21] because your desire is to ser serve
[1:35:25] him my
[1:35:27] goodness every person in here can live
[1:35:29] above sin can live without sin I live in
[1:35:32] God you'll make mistakes but the blood
[1:35:35] of Christ will forgive
[1:35:39] you you're subject to mistakes but God
[1:35:42] can't see
[1:35:44] it it's not one
[1:35:47] quote it's over and over and over I make
[1:35:50] a thousand mistakes each month each year
[1:35:52] sure I do but when I see I'm wrong God I
[1:35:56] didn't mean to do it I got trapped into
[1:35:58] it I didn't mean to do it forgive me
[1:35:59] Lord he said if I done wrong my brother
[1:36:02] I say brother forgive me I didn't mean
[1:36:03] to do it certainly God knows my heart
[1:36:05] there you are there is a blood
[1:36:08] sacrifice there is your
[1:36:11] atonement you see your atonement isn't
[1:36:14] just when you got saved and then if
[1:36:15] anything else happens in your life that
[1:36:17] you got to work this out and you got to
[1:36:19] be the best person if you ever made a
[1:36:20] mistake then you can't be a Christian
[1:36:22] and you can't be back in hey amen that
[1:36:24] come from a legalistic mind and it keeps
[1:36:27] the church bound so bound that they
[1:36:29] cannot rejoice in the power of the blood
[1:36:32] of Jesus Christ but there is an
[1:36:34] atonement for sin there is a created
[1:36:37] blood that hangs over the Church of the
[1:36:39] Living God and God can hear your voice
[1:36:42] but he can't see you because of the
[1:36:44] blood I tell you you ought to run under
[1:36:46] the blood this morning and begin to
[1:36:48] worship him through the blood let him
[1:36:50] hear your voice let him hear your voice
[1:36:52] through the blood
[1:36:54] father I love you father I worship you
[1:36:57] father I thank you Father I give you
[1:36:59] praise that through that blood you can
[1:37:02] worship Him the songs of redemption the
[1:37:05] songs of the grace of God oh I'll tell
[1:37:08] you this amen we are covered a real
[1:37:10] Christian is covered by the blood won't
[1:37:12] you stand with us amen a real Christian
[1:37:14] is covered by the blood this
[1:37:16] morning then it's not us speaking it's
[1:37:19] him
[1:37:21] speaking Glory Glory it's him speaking
[1:37:25] this
[1:37:25] morning he's
[1:37:28] speaking he's
[1:37:30] speaking through the
[1:37:33] blood my
[1:37:36] God if your life is hid under this
[1:37:39] blood then they're in the sea of
[1:37:42] forgetfulness and no man can dig them
[1:37:46] UPL not even
[1:37:49] God you know what he says that in
[1:37:51] reference to he says it in reference in
[1:37:53] coming into his prayer
[1:37:55] line he said if you come here and you've
[1:37:58] not confessed them sins he said the
[1:37:59] angel will call them right out before
[1:38:00] the
[1:38:01] congregation he said but if they've been
[1:38:03] put under the blood the secret of your
[1:38:05] hearts and the things in your life that
[1:38:07] you need or thought you have done if
[1:38:09] they're not under the blood he will
[1:38:10] expose them because if they're under the
[1:38:13] blood they're in the sea of
[1:38:14] forgetfulness and no man can dig them up
[1:38:16] that's right you're a
[1:38:20] Christian you don't have to hide hide it
[1:38:23] under the blood and then have a boness
[1:38:26] with what God has gave you I'll tell you
[1:38:29] this
[1:38:31] morning the
[1:38:33] preaching of the
[1:38:35] atonement the Roman Church would like to
[1:38:37] say that comes through them the
[1:38:39] atonement the Baptists and the lutherans
[1:38:41] and the Pentecostals would all like to
[1:38:43] say that comes through them now
[1:38:46] we're we're getting message
[1:38:50] preachers saying that's coming through
[1:38:52] them

[1:38:56] that great
[1:38:57] Ram that great Ram's Horn is sounding
[1:39:00] Out an atoning power over the church and
[1:39:03] when they come under that
[1:39:05] blood it can set you back at one with
[1:39:08] God it can scatter the sand so far that
[1:39:10] it can't be found it takes it out of the
[1:39:13] memory of God and then it not only does
[1:39:16] that but it keeps you covered from day
[1:39:19] to day

[1:43:49] of the divide the last peak of the
[1:43:52] ministry was the the third pool that's
[1:43:55] exactly where the church is standing
[1:43:57] today she's standing on that mountain of

[1:44:08] that God has gave her to possess in this
[1:44:10] age come on church it's been in God's
[1:44:13] mind the whole time when he changed the
