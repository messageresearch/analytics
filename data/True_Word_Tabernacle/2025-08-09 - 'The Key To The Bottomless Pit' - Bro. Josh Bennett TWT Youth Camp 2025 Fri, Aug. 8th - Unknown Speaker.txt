========================================

a little weak life. It put up a couple little shoots. That was a Luther's. It sure don't look like the grain that went in the ground, but the life is coming out now. Then it went on to stalk. Then what happened in the days of John Wesley? What did he do when he brought out sanctification? He stayed with the word. And what did he do? The Luthers had organized and made an organization. So it was time for something to happen. &gt;&gt; The masterpiece is being built now. What did he do? What did he do? He protested that angle in church came out in the reformation as a tossel. What is it? The seeds coming to life growing now. Now the stalk doesn't look like the seed. Neither does a tonsle. Now, Pentecostal brethren throughout the nations, I want you to listen, my brother, if this is the last message I'll ever preach. This is my masterpiece. Do you notice when the wheats the corn or wheat that falls into the ground, when it begins to farm back to its its grain again? What's nature? Nature exactly is God. God working in nature. It's all it can. But from the Pentecostal revival as they think was the seed, it wasn't. Now watch. But something come forth just like the seed. And watch what Jesus said in St. Matthew 24:24. That the two spirits at the last days would be so close together it would deceive the elected if possible. Now that stalk don't look nothing like a seed. Neither does a toss look like a seed. But notice now, not in Luther's day, but in the last day. The first thing, there's wheat farmers sitting here. The first thing that comes forth on a wheat seed, you would almost think it was a seed, but what is it? It's the husk. It forms a little outside thing like to hold the seed. It forms a husk, but the husk is not the seed no more than the tossel or the stalk was. It's only a carrier of the life, the corn of wheat. Then of St. John 12, you see Jesus speaking the wheat after the tossel after uh Wesley puts forth the husk which is the foremost like the grain of anything else. The husk is more like the grain. It's coming more like the grain all the time. The one that went in the ground. And when it comes forth the stalk, it's got life in it, but it sure isn't the grain. Comes forth the tsle, the pollen, it still isn't the grain. And then it comes forth the husk, and it's just in the shape of the wheat. Just exactly like the grain of wheat, but yet it isn't the wheat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.

Anxiety. Worrying about what tomorrow holds. Worrying about what the devil's going to do. Amen. Don't miss your joy tonight. Amen. Amen. God chose you not to be a vessel of wrath, but you've been elected to be a message believer this hour. You're called to be a vessel of mercy. Amen. That means God didn't call you to pour his judgment into you. He He called you, Amen, to pour out mercy and more mercy and more mercy. The Bible says to you, his mercies are new every morning. Amen. In other words, you stumble today. Amen. But there will be mercy tomorrow. grace and goodness and glory and hallelujah. Amen. It's good to be one of his children. Amen. He's got us in his hands. Amen. He didn't bring us this far to leave us. &gt;&gt; Amen. No fear. No fear in our hearts today. Just faith. Amen. He called you to be a Mary of this hour. Amen. He didn't ask you to be strong. He didn't ask you to be perfect. He just asks you to submit to the word that he already spoke over you &gt;&gt; and accept what it is that he's made up his mind he's going to do in you &gt;&gt; in this day. We so appreciated that service last night. &gt;&gt; Just to just to just really hit the ground running this camp meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh you know I appreciate the direction the I appreciate the ministry that we had and and I appreciated the response. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's one thing for God to inspire a minister to stand in the pulpit and present an opportunity, &gt;&gt; but it does my heart good to see young people seize that opportunity, &gt;&gt; respond to the preaching of the word. Come with faith. Amen. To to meet the Lord. That's what Brother Bram said about Mary in the message, believest thou this? You know, God spoke a word to her. Brother Bram said she didn't after after she received that word, she didn't have to have any signs. Come on. She &gt;&gt; It wasn't about It wasn't about what she felt. It wasn't about &gt;&gt; No, actually in her heart there was a little bit of a flutter of how can these things even be, &gt;&gt; you know, but uh but Brother Bam said the only thing she had to have was God's word. &gt;&gt; That's all she had to have. &gt;&gt; And he said that's all we have to have. &gt;&gt; God said so and that settles it with me. &gt;&gt; Said, "What about you? What about you tonight? Believe it. Take him at his word and say it so and just go ahead. That's all you have to have is his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother brother brother Andrew preached it so eloquently and it's bound to bring it forth. He said, "You believe it, brother? Stay with it." Hallelujah. That's right. Stay with it. It'll the word it will bring the results every time. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I have never seen it fail." He said, uh, one of the young men in the campground, he sent me this quote, and this is the part I really like here. When a true heart come before God and means business &gt;&gt; and takes God at his word and starts testifying of it and looking to the unseen, then God's promises always produce what is asked for. &gt;&gt; Amen. When a true heart comes before God and means business, how many mean business tonight? Amen. Down in your heart there. You know, there's a phrase you used to hear, you don't hear so much nowadays about getting serious with God. Amen. I appreciate the sincerity I see in in young people this hour. That's what we've come to do tonight. We're not here to play church. &gt;&gt; No, this is this is a very crucial moment. We're here to get serious with God. Coming with hearts of faith. Amen. believing that his word is where the life is, the power is. The word is the word has the answer. Amen. And you know, it's amazing how God anoints ministry like brother Andrew and brother Josh and uses them in such a such a powerful anointed way that that just one word. A man could stand here that knows nothing about your situation, nothing about what you're going through, but but one word &gt;&gt; spoken under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. that that heavy burden that's laying on your heart tonight could just slip away in a moment. One word and you could never be the same. That kind of a power is here. It's laying in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, as we as we go to the word, let's let's get serious with God tonight. Amen. Let's let's receive what God has for us tonight. We welcome brother Josh Bennett. Amen. We'll just bring you right to the pulpit, brother. How many appreciate our brother [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts together. Lord Jesus, we count it such a honor and a privilege to be standing here this evening. Lord, I just thinking about the parents and the confidence that they have and sending their children here and the pastors and Lord, even greater than that, I think about the great responsibility, Lord, that I have as a as a as your servant, Lord, to stand before the purchase of your blood. And Lord, we certainly we know it's a fearful thing. And Lord, I I pray God that you would just hide me behind the cross and you'd bind me to your word. And Lord, I pray that you would open my mouth, Lord. Lord, to say the things that you would want to say. And Lord, just close my mouth to anything that you would not want to be said. Lord, we we're so dependent upon you. Lord, I need you so much right now. And Lord, I've recognized that I I I've come and I'm standing here tonight, God, and I realize, Lord, that I just don't have the ability, Lord, there's nothing that I could say that could change a life. But Lord, just one word from you can make all the difference. And Lord, we just want to yield oursel into your into your great hands now. And Lord, as we approach your word, Lord, as your prophet said many times, anybody that has the ability to read the Bible can open up the pages and read. But Lord, we want the author of the book to come. Lord, we're inviting you and we want you to be welcome, Lord. We're giving you the preeminence among us, Lord. Lord, we want to just lift you up, Lord, in the highest place tonight, Lord. For we know, God, that if you be lifted up, you'll draw all men unto yourself, Lord. And it's our desire, God, that that we would place you in the highest place. Have your way among us now. Touch every heart and every life as we just commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this evening. Amen. We just count it such an honor to be here once again and amen to be uh with you and in God's presence. And my what a word did we hear last night. Amen. We certainly uh just appreciate Amen. Thank you, brother. Amen. Just appreciate uh what God has spoke to us. And Amen. If you have your Bibles this evening, we'll just get right into the word. Man, I I I find out that especially when I'm nervous, if I just if I just talk, I'll get myself in all kind of trouble. So, I'll just get right into the word and Amen. We'll just ask the Holy Spirit to come and help us. Amen. But if you'd take your Bibles, we'll turn to the book of Revelations in the ninth chapter of Revelations tonight. And I want to um just read from the first verse. I'm going to read several verses here. And then also in the 20th chapter of the book of Revelations, Revelations chapter 9. And we'll read from verse number one. And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth. And to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit. And there arose a smoke out of the pit as a smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And there came out of the smoke locust upon the earth. And unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power. And I was commanded or and it was commanded rather them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. And the shapes of the locust were like unto horses, prepared unto battle, and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions, and they had breastplates as it were the breastplates of iron. And the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails, and their power was to hurt me in five months. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abdon. But in the Greek tongue hath his name Apolon. One woe is passed, and behold, there come two woes more hereafter. If we could turn to Revelations chapter 20, I'd just like to read a few verses there. And as you're turning there, I read down through those verses in chapter 9 to I wanted to read to verse 12 to show you as the Bible speaks uh that one woe is passed and two more it comes. U we know by the grace of God what those woes are and those woes are great wars upon the earth. So we know by that verse that this scripture is is has a meaning of the end times. See &gt;&gt; and so it it has something to do with even the day that we're living in. And and I wanted to show you that because I think it's very important for us to see in Revelations chapter 20 and we'll just read from the first verse here. And the Bible says, "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he lay hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled. and after that he must be loosed a little season. May God decide his blessings as you're seated tonight. I know some of you's already thinking, uh, Brother Josh, don't you know this is a youth service and you you're reading out the book of Revelations, you know, and uh talking about things that's happening under the the the the fifth trumpet and and uh these great mysteries. But I want you to understand tonight that this is just not any youth camp. &gt;&gt; We are not at a Bible youth camp. &gt;&gt; We ain't at vacation Bible stool. You didn't come to play a few games and hear a story about Noah. But Amen. But I believe that there's some young people that I'm preaching to tonight that has the ability to understand the things of God. Amen. The the prophet of God said that the book of Revelation has more symbols in it than the rest of the books in the Bible. It has more symbols because it's a book of prophecy. It's a prophetic book and therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class. See, the book is not meant for everybody. Amen. There's nobody that can understand it hardly. The book is made for a certain class of people. Amen. But the Bible says in Deuteronomy that the hidden things belong to the Lord. That's right. Amen. But he reveals it to us, his children. The hidden things. Amen. Actually, Brother Brham is quoting this scripture. The secret things belong unto the Lord our God. But the things which are revealed belong to us and to our children. Amen. Do you believe that? Amen. And so I just want to say this. I want to start the service by saying this tonight. This message belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking to the young people tonight. This message belongs to you. Amen. Don't let nobody talk you out of it or take it away from you. Amen. I'll admit this. Anything that's hidden belongs to the Lord. But the things that are revealed belongs to us. Amen. It it's it's our right to it. Amen. Do do you believe that tonight? Amen. So, as we look at this, I want to just speak just for the next few minutes on the key to the bottomless pit. And I I hope by the grace of God that that God will help us. But but you see here in in in the scripture that you know uh um uh in in Revelations 9, you'll see uh uh when the fifth angel sounded that there was a star that's falling out of heaven. Amen. He's he's fallen to the earth and it was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. Now, amen. you you we're going to find out uh as we go that that that the prophet is going to identify who this star is and he's going to do it by the scripture and he's going to go back to Isaiah and he's amen how art thou fallen oh Lucifer amen he's going to show us who this is but as we see amen this star falling out of heaven you'll notice that he is given something now you're going to you see this all through the scripture Satan is given a bow he's amen in Revelation 6 he's given a sword even he's he's given a lot of things but but you know uh none of them things belong to him but it's given to him amen and it's given to him for a purpose amen but you see as he falls down out of heaven it it was given unto him a key to the bottomless pit and he's going to take that key and open something up amen but I I want to just make this point before I go any further because amen the prophet preaches a message in 1962 called the key to the door and he actually uses Revelations chapter 20. Amen. And the and the angel that come down from heaven with a key, amen, to to the bottomless pit. And he uses that as a as a text and he preaches a key to the door. And and and as brother Bram is speaking on that, he said, "I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great train uh uh chain in his hand." He said, "I want to take for a text if I call this," Amen. or draw a context from this text. Amen. I would like to call it the key to the door. And now I don't wish to make it keys. Amen. Because Peter was given the keys to the kingdom. But I want to call this the key to the door. Amen. And now a key. Amen. If we notice here as we read this, an angel come down from heaven having a key in his hand. I believe in Revelations 13, but I I believe brother Brown was referring to Revelations 9. He said we find again another angel coming with a key. Amen. And a key, a purpose of a key is to unlock something that's been locked up. Amen. Or is something that should be locked up. So, but a key is given for that purpose. And and then he makes a point that a key cannot unlock the door with itself, but it takes a hand to hold the key. Amen. In other words, amen. Somebody has to take amen and use the key before the key could actually do anything or be any good. Amen. And and brother B would say, Amen. And uh he said uh uh in the stature of a perfect man referring back to the key to the door. He said I preached on the key and the key is faith. And faith holds the key, amen, to the scripture. Now, now we're talking about the another key, the key of faith, amen, which holds the key to the scripture. Amen. How many believes that the power is in the word? Amen. But but there's got to be something to unlock that. Amen. So the prophet said, "The key that unlocks the power of the word is faith." Amen. Therefore, Amen. The prophet said, "I believe that the full gospel, every word of God that turns the power of God loose, it turns his blessings to the people. It's the key to the door that unlocks it." Amen. Now, I just say this. It don't matter whose hand holds the key. As long as you got a hand that can hold the key, enough strength in your hand, amen, to take the key, put it in the lock and turn it, amen, that key will do just the same for you as it did for anybody else. Now, that's that's important for you to see because Amen. I believe, amen. Amen. That God sent us a message in this day that revealed to us a key that will unlock, Amen. every promise that's in the Bible. And I believe that not only did God send it, but he actually showed us by example. Amen. Somebody actually used the key and unlocked the potential that laid in the word of God. Amen. But what I want you to see tonight, if you could ever get the same key in your hand, it'll do the same thing for you that it did for anybody else. Amen. You just have to take the key. Amen. Because it's the key that unlocks the door. Oh my. I believe that with all my heart. Amen. And and now the prophet would say this in that message. He said, you know, a key that locks also unlocks. See, you can loose or bind. That's right. Amen. This same key that unlocks, the key unlocks can lock up. See, just exactly because it works both ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we just go back to our scripture, Amen. We see a a a star falling from heaven. He's given a key. Amen. To open the bottomless pit. Now, I just want to start by uh uh finding out what is the bottomless pit. Amen. It's mentioned seven times by that name in the Bible. Three times in Revelations 9. Then again in Revelations 11. Amen. You find it mentioned again. Amen. You'll find it also in Revelation 17. There was a beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit and goes into predition. Amen. And twice more. You'll find it in Revelations 20. Now the same Greek word is used also in the book of Luke in Luke chapter 8 when Jesus uh uh comes to the uh the man that had allegiance of devils in him. Amen. That that those demons that was in that man actually uh called out amen to Jesus and said please don't send us into the deep. Amen. And that word deep there is the same Greek word that is used for the bottomless pit. And the reason that I wanted to show you this is because amen I believe that we can say by the authority of the word and the message of the hour that the bottomless pit is hell. It's it's speaking of a place amen that we would call hell or the regions of a loss. Now we got to understand this because hell is not just a burning blazing place. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just something like the Amen. that maybe the denominational world has made hell just a a a place of fire or whatever it may be. Amen. But do you know that the scripture speaks of what we would call the regions of the lost? A place where there's weeping and whailing and nashing of teeth. There's there's a place of torment. A place amen a dimension if we could call it that. A dimension. Amen. Amen. And the prophet of God in the in the in the sermon why we are not a denomination. He said the beast that thou saw Amen. that was and is not and shall be ascended out of the bottomless pit goes into predition. Amen. And they that dwell upon the earth will wonder whose names were not written in the book, amen, of life from the foundational world. See, there's going to be a bunch on the earth. In other words, there that's going to be deceived. For he deceived them. And there was only one group that was not deceived, and that was those that had their names on the book of life from the foundation of the world. How many thankful tonight that your name is on that book? Amen. And he goeth into predition. Now, anyone knows that predition means hell. And watch, he ascended out of hell. Amen. And he goes into Amen. Or the bottomless pit. Amen. And what is this bottom bottomless pit? Now, the prophet's going to help us right here. He said, "It's something that has no foundation." Now, I'm amazed at what Brother Brown did because he went straight from that and says, "You'll notice that Catholic doctrine ain't got no foundation." Now, I want to tell you, there's a lot of teachings and there's a lot of ideas. Amen. And they might sound good. Amen. And they might look good and Amen. But I tell you, the trouble is is it ain't got no foundation. Amen. But I want to encourage you with this tonight. Amen. The message that we follow, Amen, has got a foundation. Friends, we are not following cunningly devised fables tonight. Amen. And this ain't just a bunch of thought up ideas, but the message of the hour has a scriptural foundation. It's a place that you can stand. Hallelujah. You can rest your soul on it, brother, because there's a foundation to it. I tell you what, there's a lot of people believing a lot of things and they're on their way to a place that ain't got no foundation. But my Bible says, Amen, that the there was some people in the Bible that were looking for a city that had foundation. Hallelujah. And I tell you this tonight, I believe I'm looking at some people that's believe in a word that's got a foundation and it's going to take us to a city where it's got a foundation. Hallelujah. We know where we're standing at. Amen. We know where we're standing on. Amen. Because I tell you this, Jesus said, Amen. upon this rock. Amen. The rock of revelation will I build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. [Applause] Hallelujah. Do you believe that? Amen. It ain't got no foundation. See? Amen. This bottomless pit now. Amen. It's speaking of hell. Not just a burning, blazing fire. Amen. But but but a place, a region of the lost. Now, you know, Brother Brandham, after he had been shot while he was hunting, when he was just a boy, he he went in vision. He he went to this place and and and and if it's all right, I'll just share with you some of what he se seen there. He said, "And in this time I had a vision and I had passed from this life into into the vision struck me, I was so weak and I had lost all that blood and and I was sinking into an endless eternity. And I thought I was just going through the clouds and then through darkness and sinking on down, down, down." And the first thing you know, I got into the regions of the lost and I I I began to scream and I looked and there just everything there was no foundation to it. There was no foundation to it. I just couldn't stop falling. Amen. It looked like I was just going to fall and there was no stopping nowhere. And then what a difference it was from the vision I h had here not long ago of being in glory with the people. Amen. You see the contrast. But in this, I I was just falling. And finally, I screamed for my daddy. Of course, being just a kid, amen, that's what I would do. And I screamed for my daddy, but my daddy wasn't there. I screamed for my mother. Amen. I I wanted somebody to catch me, but there was no mother there. I I I just going and I screamed out to God. Amen. But God, there was nothing. There was no God wasn't there. There was just nothing there. And after a while, I heard the most mournful sound that I ever heard. Amen. And it was the awfulest feeling. There was just no way. Amen. Even a literal burning fire would have been a pleasure by the side of what this was. And I heard a noise and it sounded like some kind of haunted affair. And when I looked coming, it was women and they had this green stuff just just on their face and and and a and under their eyes. And their eyes look like they run back like women today paint their eyes just run back like that and just on their on their face. and and they were going, "Ooh, oh my." I just screamed out, "Oh God, have mercy upon me. Have mercy, oh God, where are you? If if you'll only let me go back and live, I promise I'll be a good boy." Amen. That's the only thing I could say. Amen. And then in a moment's time, amen, I was back to natural life again. And the thing has bothered me. And I thought, "Oh, let it be that I'll never go to a place like that." And no other human being will ever have to go to a place like that. And I knew that there was a region of the dam somewhere. You see, this is a prophet by vision describing this place, a a place with no foundation, a place, amen, just falling and falling. And amen. And I I just say this, you know, I believe it's so important for us to realize, amen, that that once a a man dies and he finds himself in that place, there's there's no daddy that can help him. There's there's no mama there to help. There's, even God at that time. Amen. Because God has given you an opportunity like you heard preach here last night. Amen. Today is the day of salvation. Amen. God has gave us a space to repent. I tell you this tonight. Amen. Hey, you may feel like you're falling tonight. Amen. But I tell you, as long as there's breath in your body, there's a hand that can reach down and catch you. Amen. You can be delivered, amen, from that that place. Amen. But friends, there's a time coming when there be no hell for it. You see what I'm saying? Now, I I want to just move forward with this because Amen. I I want to get to the point of my message. But we find this angel. So, now we understand what the bottomless pit is. And there's an angel come or a star rather that's fell from heaven. Amen. And he's got a key and he's going to open up this bottomless pit and something's going to come out of it. See? Amen. Is it okay if I just say what a prophet said? He said, "Brother, the lid has come off of hell." The lid has come off of hell. Amen. all and the streams of demon power is pounding or pouring in from everywhere. It's conquered the nations. It's conquered politics. Amen. Until it's just rotten to the core. It's conquered the churches until they know nothing but denomination. You say, "Are you a Christian?" "I'm a Methodist." Or, "Are you a Christian? I'm a Pentecostal." That don't mean no more. Amen. Than nothing. As I said the other day, that don't mean no uh no more. Amen. than a a a pig or a hog or a horse or something. Amen. It has nothing to do with it. You're a Christian when you're born again and filled with the Holy Ghost. And not until that. Amen. And you're yielded completely to the spirit. If you're not yielded to the spirit, then you're not born again. And you don't have the Holy Ghost. You might speak in tongues and shiver and jump and run and do all kind of things. Paul said, "I can move mountains with faith. I can heal the sick. I can have knowledge." Amen. I could go to a seminary and learn all this stuff and everything and yet I'm nothing. Oh my. You talk about the lid off the kettle. Amen. And demons going around and the powers of the devil under the name of Christianity teaching for doctrine the commandments of men theological seminary doctrines leaving the Bible alone. And who is able? Who's strong enough? Who's wise enough? who's powerful enough to tame this legion that's stripping the clothes off of our women. Amen. In the in the preachers, Methodists, Amen. Baptist, Pentecostals. Amen. These women painting their faces like Jezebels, bobbing their hair, wearing pants just like men. And our preachers ain't got enough get up about them to tell them about it. It's demon possession. It was a legion that tore off the clothes of the man. Amen. Who is this roaring devil? And who's strong enough? What kind What kind of denomination is able to conquer him walking up and down through these tombstones? A denomination is crying the days of miracles has passed. And we don't need the Holy Ghost. Who can tame that devil? Oh God, we can't do it by denomination. We can't do it by ecclesiastical forces. But there was a voice one time that did it. Hallelujah. There was a voice that tamed them devils and put them right. Amen. Put the man right in his right mind. I tell you what voice did it? It was the voice of our Lord. Hallelujah. The question is tonight, who is going to tame, Amen, these spirits of Leosa? Amen. These evil spirits been the spirits of fashion that's come through Hollywood. Come on, church. I want to just tell you, I know it's youth camp. Amen. But I still believe in preaching the gospel. Amen. I believe that the gospel is a closline gospel. Amen. It's a gospel of holiness. I believe God's bride is going to be a holy bride. I believe that the church of the living God will be a clean church. I say God give us some men, amen, with a backbone enough to stand and preach it the way the prophet said it, the way the Bible says it. But the Bible says that a woman shouldn't cut her hair. And if she does, she Oh, come on, church. Do you know that this Bible teaches us, Amen. If a woman bs her hair off, God will not even hear a prayer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But the spirits of the end time have got so powerful and strong until somebody will come and a preacher will come and explain that away and water it down and say, "I don't really mean that. [Applause] Come on. And then you see them things slipping right into the church. And &gt;&gt; somebody said, "Well, you know, I I just don't want to hurt nobody's feelings." Well, I just say it the way I believe it. I'd rather have my feelings hurt now. Hey, I told my church the other day, I said if there's something in my life that ain't pleasing to God, I pray the Holy Ghost exposes me. I pray that the spirit of God will send a man to the pull pit and expose that thing in my life. It might embarrass me, but I'd rather be embarrassed now and make it. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] prophet said we you know who's going to be able to stand against it? Who who what power what power will be able to withstand these spirits? Hell has been opened up. The lid is lifted off of it and demon powers are striking from every side. And who's going to be able to stand? And he said your denomination won't do it. Amen. Your church won't do it. Come on church. I want to tell you. Amen. Just being a good church member ain't going to cut it. Just paying ti and having good church attendance, that ain't going to do it. Going to youth camp once or twice a year, that ain't going to do it, friends. Ain't got one power that'll withstand amen the spirits of this age, and that's the power of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. I tell you friends, it is not an option tonight. Amen. You either are born again and filled with the spirit of God or you ain't going in the rapture. Ain't no side doors. Ain't no shortcuts. There ain't no other way. I promise we see in this age we're living in how can I overcome? Amen. We see in this age we're living that one of the grandest ages of all the ages. The Leo sin church age. The greatest of all the church age because Amen. It's the ending of time and the blending of eternity. It's a great but and then it's the greatest sinful age &gt;&gt; that there's ever been &gt;&gt; and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it had been in any age. &gt;&gt; That's why I I I want to stand here tonight. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this. I believe I'm looking at a at a generation &gt;&gt; and some of you parents that are here and and some of you that's sitting in the back, you got to realize this. You say, "Well, I was a kid one time, too." And we were, and we had battles, and we still got battles. &gt;&gt; But I tell you this, these kids are fighting battles you never fought. &gt;&gt; And the powers of the enemy that's that has been released upon them is greater than anything we've ever faced. &gt;&gt; But I will say this with great confidence. The same way I overcome, you can too. The same God, hallelujah, the same power of the Holy Ghost, the same Ray Ericson. Amen. That kept him all these years and he's still standing here tonight. Come on, church. If God did it in Ray Eric, if he did it in Wayne Lawson, if he done it in Matthew McGary and he done it in me, he'll do it in you, too. The power of the enemy might be greater, but the power of the Holy Ghost is greater still. Where sin did abound, grace did much more abound. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to catch this though. The pit is open. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, is there is is is it okay if I show you something here? Because a prophet one Amen. was sitting in a department store, &gt;&gt; JC Penneyy's part department store &gt;&gt; and he began to see a scene &gt;&gt; and brother David when he saw those women and I want you to understand something tonight friends I ain't preaching against the people &gt;&gt; it's the spirit [Applause] [Music] I tell you what if you if you if you get looking down your nose at people in this world amen you're on a bad path cuz if not for the grace of God there I be. If it weren't for the grace of God, there would you be. Amen. We would all be there tonight. It ain't the people, it's the spirit. And the prophet of God was looking at them women as they was coming off that escalator and and he said, "Wait a minute. I think I saw this before and something come to his mind or his memory." Amen. God brought something to his memory that the same thing the same thing he saw in hell, he saw on the earth. Why? Because the influence, amen, of that dimension had pressed his way into this dimension. Because a lid of hell has been torn off, the pin has opened up. And what a prophet saw in hell, he saw right on the earth. Listen to me, sisters. That'll tell you right there. Amen. Where all this makeup's coming from. And when you put it on, the influence that you're under. And what kingdom are you reflecting? Come on, church. Amen. You know it's the truth tonight. Amen. But I tell you what, I got to thinking about that in my room today. And I was thinking about a prophet sitting in JC Penney. Amen. And he saw a scene and he said, Amen. I wait. I saw this before. And I got to thinking about this and I thought, I wonder if that prophet could come to this camp. And he sat on this platform and look out of this audience. Amen. I wonder if he could say something like this. Wait just a minute. I think I saw this somewhere before because the same prophet that went to the fifth dimension went to the sixth dimension. [Applause] Hallelujah. And I'll tell you what he saw over there. He saw a bunch of young people. Oh, some of them is old when they die. But when he saw they were young and they were clothed in the beauty of holiness and they were resting on the message that he preached. And I believe that if he was here tonight, he could look out at this audience and say, "Wait a minute. I saw this character before. I heard this testimony before. Because what I saw over there, I'm seeing a reflection of it here. [Music] Hallelujah. I just get ahead of myself and go ahead and say this. All hell's been turned loose, but friends, heaven has come down. There's another influence that's been released in this age by another star. He wasn't a fallen star. He was the seven star that was held in the hand of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, hell is on the earth. I don't know about the rest of y'all, but sometimes I feel like I'm living in it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know, right now you're in youth camp and you're in a meeting, man. You're surrounded by believers and &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit's a reality. And &gt;&gt; Amen. You're sheltered and protected and &gt;&gt; but you go to Walmart or you go, "Hey, you ain't got to go very far. just pump gas in your car. &gt;&gt; Them influences are everywhere. &gt;&gt; It's coming from every side. And the prophets of God identified. He said the lid of hell has been tore up. It's been lifted off. You can see it right in the Bible. Even the timeline of it is revealed to us. Amen. That in between the first and second wo, there's something that's going to be released upon the earth. I'll just say it this way. If you feel comfortable here, there's an altar here tonight. &gt;&gt; And I'd come and weep my way to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Because I want to tell you, if ain't a cry in your heart, even so, come Lord Jesus. Amen. We ought to be realizing greater than ever, this world is not our home. Amen. This place ain't even know where it ain't even fit for a believer to live in anymore. friends, we're looking for a way of escape. There's got to be a way out of this. Amen. But I was pondering on that, too. And I got to thinking, you know what? I might feel like I'm in hell now. But I got good news for you. Amen. Some of y'all that's been born again and filled with the Holy Ghost, this is the only hell you ever going to experience. Hallelujah. This is the only taste of it that you're ever going to get. I just tell the devil tonight, you better do what you can, oh boy. Amen. Because I tell you right now, Amen. I'm leaving here. Amen. One day, very soon. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to be delivered from this wicked world. [Music] But it's a reality, church. This is where we're living at. &gt;&gt; It's a day we're living in. You know the even under the revelation of this the opening of the seals we seen the antichrist riding on four horses same rider the whole time as a spirit antichrist spirit worn against the church &gt;&gt; white horse red horse black horse that pale horse was a mixture of all of it together and how many knows that the name of the rider was identified and and the Bible says that hell followed His name is death and hell followed. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? I know, amen. That you know, Satan is not fully incarnated, making his full ride at this time. But friends, the pale horse is already riding. Amen. We ain't fighting a white horse. We ain't fighting. Come on, friends. Amen. That pale horse of death is already rid. And spiritual death is striking the land. Last plague struck Egypt was death. last plague that will strike the the the terror of the world. Amen. Is spiritual death before the Exodus. How many believe that's true? Amen. And that is already happening. You say, "Oh, brother, what are you trying to say?" I'm trying to say, tell you this. There's people that are living and breathing. There's people sitting on church pews that are dead as they can be. You say, "Oh, brother, you're going to have to show me that in the B." Okay. The woman that sinnth is dead while she yet liveth. There's people that are dying spiritually. Amen. And the prophet of God said, "What follows death?" Hell always follows death. And he's showing you something in the scripture that hell has been released in this age. Death is riding and hell is following. But I got some good news. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of God, raises a standard. Hallelujah. And when that white horse, Amen, went out, God raised up a standard. There was an anointing of a lie that was released upon the people to withstand that Antichrist spirit. When the red horse went out, there was an anointing of an ox that was released to withstand amen that in that martyr age. Amen. In the in the black horse, amen, with a pair of bounces in his hand, it was anointing of a man that was released in that age to combat and withstand that spirit. But in this age, when death is riding and a pale horse is going out, there's a flying eagle. Hallelujah. Friends, every one of them other creatures were earthbound creatures, but when it come to the eagle, it was a flying eagle. Because this anointing is not just going to anoint you to survive this age. This anointing didn't just come to help you just to make it through. But this is a rapture anointing. This is an overcoming anointing. Amen. That will absolutely defeat the enemy and lift you up above. [Applause] Now think about this cuz under this in this in this in this revelations 9, brother B was saying the feast of the trumpets, he said this army. So if you continue to read on down in Revelations chapter 9, you're going to find that there was something released out of the river Euphrates. &gt;&gt; It was actually 200,000,000 horsemen. &gt;&gt; It gives description of them. Brother Brown comes and says ain't that many horsemen in the in the world. And look at the description that's given of them. They're supernatural demons. &gt;&gt; Not natural horsemen. They're supernatural demons. 200 million demons &gt;&gt; released into this age. &gt;&gt; And you can see it very clearly in history. All you got to do is study history. You'll find that them demons come upon men and their armies &gt;&gt; to persecute Israel. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and the prophet of God said, "And that army had a king." And he said, "Their king was identified in Revelations 9:1, a star falling out of heaven." And then he identifies that by the scripture, "How art thou fallen, oh Lucifer?" And he said, "See, Satan himself is the king over that army coming out of the river Euphrates. 200 million devils." Amen. But this is the thing you got to catch. Amen. But them same devils that got on the armies of Ikeman and Stalin and Muslin and Hitler and their armies and and persecuted the Jews and drove them back to their homeland, them same demons, the prophet said has become ecclesiastical devils. But can I just tell you to this way? Amen. When them wars was over and Israel went into their homeland, them devils didn't go back to river Euphrates. Them same demons, amen, just change a little bit and become ecclesiastical demons. He said, "And their waring been turned loose." He said, "Not against the church, against the bride of Jesus Christ." Could you imagine? Hey, this ought to help you tonight. Amen. You was wondering why it's so hard to serve God. &gt;&gt; You wondering why it's so hard to read your Bible and pray. You wondering why it's so hard to listen to a tape. You wonder why it's so hard to make it to church. You wonder why it's so hard even when you get here, you can't hardly lift your hand. You can't get an amen out. You wonder because all the every devil in hell is against you and there's 200 million demons that is waring against the bride even right now. I want to tell you friends, don't you be mistaken. Amen. The devil is real. Spirits are real. There's a battle going on right now in this building. And Satan is trying to block you from receiving the word of God because he knows if you get a revelation [Applause] of who you are and what you stand for, hallelujah, that Satan will be just as defeated by you as he was by Jesus Christ. With the revelation of God in your heart, you will be an invincible army. So the devil's doing everything he can to block it and stop it. Oh, you know I'm telling the truth. Amen. That devil's been fighting you all week before you got here. And the battle didn't end when you got here. He's fighting you right now. But I want to tell you, amen, them devils, them 200 million devils ain't the only people fighting. That's not the only army in this building. [Applause] Hallelujah. I feel good to say this. Amen. Because the Bible numbers the devils. But over in Hebrews chapter 12, the same Bible says, amen, that we are compass them out by an innumerable company of angels. There's 200 million devils against you, but there's so many angels that you can't even number them. Friends, I want to tell you tonight, there's more for us than there is against us. Hallelujah. I'm talking about them angels that kept their first estate. Them angels that stood with Michael in heaven. Them angels that didn't believe the devil's lie. Them same angels have taken their place by your side. In the prophet of God, a man that can see in another dimension come and declare declared unto us, "This building is full of the angels tonight. The angels are here. Christ is here. The Holy Ghost is here." One place he said they're here to energize your faith. As &gt;&gt; a matter of fact, Brother Bam would describe it this way. He said, "You ever Amen." I'm paraphrasing now, so y'all give me a little bit of grace. He said, "But you ever you ever, you know, been sitting in a service and you just feel something in you say hallelujah." &gt;&gt; You don't even know why. You just sitting there and all of a sudden, amen, the word is coming over something in your heart that says, "Amen." Amen. You didn't even mean to do it. Matter of fact, some of y'all come determined. Amen. You just come determined. I ain't I ain't getting into the service. I am not going to say, "Amen. I ain't going down this path again. I am not going to stand. I ain't going to get caught up in this excite. I'm not going to do nothing." And after just a little while, amen, you just can't even help yourself. And somehow come along and they'll say, "That's just a workout. That's just somebody. That's just this or that." But a prophet said, amen, that sometimes when you feel that urge to say amen or hallelujah or raise your hand or just stand up on your feet, he said an angel has just bucked into you. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I say this, maybe somebody got excited, but somebody else got touched by an angel. [Applause] Maybe somebody else just did it because a brother did it, but somebody else just walked into something that's so real. Hallelujah. What is that? That's the army of God coming to stand by your side. [Applause] [Music] Let me tell you something, church. &gt;&gt; I ain't done yet. &gt;&gt; Let's go. I'm going to tell you something. Amen. Them 200 million devils ain't the only things being released. [Applause] Cuz the prophet of God said in the same message, same place, he said, "And the Holy Ghost that's been bound at the doors of Crelas for 2,000 years has been loosed. Hallelujah. Oh, I want to preach right now because in Revelations 9, you see a star falling out of heaven and he's given a key. But brother, if you just keep reading your Bible, Amen. You get in the next chapter in Revelations 10, there's a mighty angel that come down. He didn't fall down. He wasn't cast down. He come down. Hallelujah. And another mighty angel come down out of heaven calling the cloud. Oh, this is And he has something in his hand. It was a book open. He was bringing a revelation. He was bringing you something to give you victory. Hallelujah. I tell you, I just let you know a little a little bit more about the p the picture. Amen. You go to Revelation 17 and 8. The Bible says a beast ascended out of the bottomless pit and goeth into predition. Brother B said he come out of hell and he goes back to hell. Amen. But when he goes, he ain't gone by himself. &gt;&gt; But because of deception, he'll take many with him. Because the Bible says all wondered after him that didn't have their names written in the landsburg of lie before the foundation of the world. He come out of hell. He's going back to hell. And through deception, he'll carry somebody with him. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. But a mighty angel come down out of heaven. Christ come out of heaven. And friends, he's going back to heaven. But he ain't going back. [Applause] He come out of heaven and he's going back to heaven. But brother, he's taking me with him by the revelation of Malachi 4. Luke 17:30. Revelations 10:7. The message, the evening time message has loosed the Holy Spirit. Christ is back in his church. [Music] Oh, just give him a great hand clap of praise tonight. [Applause] Hell has been opened up. Heaven has come down. The shield is off the book. We know who we are. We know where we came from. We know where we're going. [Music] Hallelujah. This ain't a bunch of work up. This ain't a Pentecostal pump up. I want you to take notice tonight. Ain't nobody on no instrument up here. Ain't nobody beating it up, pumping it up, working it up. It's the word of God. It's the revelation that has been released in this hour. [Applause] That revelation, Amen, will conquer the devil. [Music] I believe we showed enough of the other side to say this. Amen. Listen, friends. The chill bumps will leave. The excitement will end. camp will be over in a couple days. But if you get a revelation in your heart, all the devils in hell can't take that out of you. [Music] If God comes down and reveals to you, amen, that this message is thus sayeth the Lord, it's a foundation. Amen. It's your grace. It's your way of escape. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me just I better &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now listen, I I spent a lot of time saying a lot of things. I don't think they were in vain, sir. &gt;&gt; But I I want to come to one point. &gt;&gt; There's a key. &gt;&gt; Remember, brother R said the key can either unlock &gt;&gt; or lock. Now, I've showed you in the Bible tonight exactly that. &gt;&gt; That's right. A &gt;&gt; star falls out of heaven. Revelations 9, he's given a key. He opens up the bottomless pit. But in Revelations 20, the Bible says, "And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit &gt;&gt; and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him. I want to tell you, and remember, Revelation is book of symbols. You're going to see a lot of things, and if you study the book of Revelations, you're going to see angels with with things in their hands. You'll see Christ standing in in in the first part of the book of Revelations. He got seven stars in his hands. You'll find an angel in Revelation 7 with the seal of God. You'll keep on reading. You'll see an angel with a sickle. You You see a mighty angel with an open book. You see, Amen. all these things. But now you see this angel coming down out of heaven with a key and a chain. &gt;&gt; And he's coming for a purpose. And when he comes to he, what's he do? He lays hold. &gt;&gt; He lays hold on the dragon. &gt;&gt; I feel I feel like I need to just make this point too. Ain't this amazing? The Bible says he lay hold on the dragon one. &gt;&gt; That old serpent &gt;&gt; two which is the devil three &gt;&gt; and Satan. &gt;&gt; Do you know that that is talking about one &gt;&gt; thing? [Applause] a dragon, &gt;&gt; a serpent, &gt;&gt; a devil, and Satan &gt;&gt; and it's all the same thing. &gt;&gt; How many of you can see that? &gt;&gt; You know, a whole lot of people can see that. Why in the world can't they see that when you talk about father son Holy Ghost Melzdc really rose I don't care what title you give to him it's all talking about the same person and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ come on tree that is a revelation that will defeat the devil right there and I tell you I'm so glad that when you young people get on your knees and pray you ain't wondering who to pray to or which God to call upon. on or which name to use or if you're going through depression, I got to pray to this certain saint. Or if I'm sick, I got to pray to somebody. Come on, church. Amen. If you just call on the name of Jesus, he's Jehovah Gyra. He's Jehovah Shalom. He's Jehovah Tu. He's your peace. He's your battle. Hallelujah. He's Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. [Music] Hallelujah. But this angel comes down. He's got a key &gt;&gt; and a chain. &gt;&gt; Now, I I I got to say this before I go any further. This scripture is speaking of the millennium. &gt;&gt; How many understands? I want to just be real clear. &gt;&gt; This scripture is speaking of the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are not in the millennium. But nevertheless, amen. You got to understand the point that a key is being revealed &gt;&gt; and it's a key that opens and shuts. &gt;&gt; And the key already exists. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. The key already exists. There's coming a time in the future that's that that an angel's going to come down and bind Satan for a millennium. and he will be bound on this earth for a thousand years. How many believe that's true? But but you ain't got to wait till the millennium &gt;&gt; to have victory. No, you ain't never going to tell me that I got to wait till the millennium to have dominion over sin, over the devil, and over the flesh. Because my Bible says he hath made us kings and priests under our God. You are a spiritual king right now. Hallelujah. Listen to me church. How many knows this? The prophet of God said Satan will be bound not by a long chain change of circumstances. &gt;&gt; You know what'll bind Satan? You'll have nobody to work through. [Applause] Satan will be bound in the millennium. He said because all his subjects are dead. Amen. They're all in the grave. There's been no resurrection for them. Amen. And there's absolutely nobody that Satan can talk through or see through or hear through or work through. [Music] Come on, church. Amen. We can't bind Satan in America right now. But you can bind him in your bedroom. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to wait for no millennium to find Satan in your life. Come on, church. You say, "Brother, how to do it?" I tell you, the key has already been given by the revelation of the word. Amen. Just don't give the devil no occasion. Just tell the devil tonight, you will not use my hands. You will not use my eyes. You will not use my ears. You will not use my lips. I tell you what, I believe we can bind Satan in our church. I believe you can bind him in your house. I believe we ought to have a testimony tonight at true word camp that Satan is so bound in this camp that he don't even know what to do. Amen. Why? Because he just can't get nobody. [Music] Hallelujah. There ain't nobody that's going to gossip. There ain't nobody that's going to listen. Listen to me, young people. The key has been given to you. Resist the devil and he will flee. Hallelujah. Say, "Brother Josh, what are you trying to say tonight?" I'm trying to say, "Quit laying down. [Applause] Quit giving in. Quit making an excuse. Get up. Shake yourself. And resist that devil tonight. Don't forget about the first part of that scripture. Submit yourself therefore unto God and resist the devil and he will flee. [Music] Paul says it this way. Ephesians 4:27, "Neither give place to the devil." &gt;&gt; You know what that word means in the Greek? It means don't give no quarter. &gt;&gt; Don't give no license, no opportunity or occasion for acting. Come on. &gt;&gt; I know some people don't really care for this, the Amplified Bible, but it says it this way. And do not give the devil an opportunity to leave you to lead you into sin by holding a grudge or nurturing anger or harboring resentment or cultivating bitterness. I'm giving you the key. Say, "Brother, what kind of key you talking about?" I'm talking about love. Forgive. Repent. [Music] Say my brother, I fell. Get up. But I made a mistake. Make it right. Don't lay down. Rise up. Take the key in your hand tonight. Oh, come on, young people. I'm going to ask you the question tonight. Has anybody got a hand to hold it? The key is here. I'm telling you, the key to bind Satan is here. You can lead this camp with victory. The key has been given to you. Have you got a hand to hold it? Have you got faith to believe it? Well, I tell you, if somebody's here tonight and you're lacking faith and you say, "Brother Josh, I just ain't I just can't I'm struggling and I I just ain't got enough faith." Well, I got good news. My Bible says, "Faith cometh. [Applause] Faith cometh. Let's just work on that a minute. Faith come. You say, "Brother, I I ain't got the faith I need." Well, faith cometh. Faith is coming to you tonight. Faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God. Do you realize it? Even right here tonight, while the word of God is being preached, faith is coming to you. And I'll say this, you got more faith than you even realize. Turn it loose and see what'll happen. I'm going to close right here. Amen. But I say some of you sitting around say, "Well, brother, I just ain't got a hand. I ain't got a hand to hold it. I just ain't got a hand to reach out and grab a hold of what you're talking about. I see the key is real, but what I'm lacking is a hand to hold it. Amen. Well, I got some more good news because the prophet said, he said that we're living in the age now that missing limbs will be restored. Hallelujah. Amen. And he said that if God could create a square right there, could not he create what is missing on a man? Listen, you might have come here. Amen. And the devil might have cut your hands off. He might have took your faith away from you to hold the word of God and stand toe to toe with him. But I want to tell you, ain't nobody the authority of the message of the hour. You're living in the right age at the right time because the God that I serve can create a hand that will hold the word in the face of every devil. take the key. Reach out and get a chain tonight. And I want to encourage every young person in this building, lay hold of that old devil, that old serpent, and bind him in the name of Jesus Christ. You ain't got to wait to the millennium to overcome depression. You ain't got to wait till the millennium to overcome pornography and lust. You can do it tonight by the power of the word of God. Take it in your hand and bind the devil and whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. Hallelujah. Give the Lord some praise tonight as the musicians come. [Applause] [Music] The key is here. [Applause] [Music] The angel has come. The book is open. The mighty angel come to give you the revelation. [Music] Listen friends, there's more sin. There's more sin in this age than any other age. But God did not leave you &gt;&gt; fighting with insufficient armor tonight &gt;&gt; because as a sin increased, &gt;&gt; brother Brown said the revelation of the word, &gt;&gt; God revealed his word in every age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was it? He was giving you something &gt;&gt; to overcome with. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, it's just as simple as the scripture says. Faith is our victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Now the Bible plainly tells how the Holy Ghost fell. Signs and wonders were done by the apostles hands. Evil spirits were cast down. I said evil spirits were cast down. They sing while surrounded by God's holy angel man. Now if you think it's all gone and the mirales are done, I have some good news to bring to you in the last days of his spo. It's heat. Heat. Heat.

Oh, [Music] hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I so appreciated the way that brother Josh started off the service this evening. It just so expresses the burden behind this youth camp. [Music] that we're not here to get a bunch of young people together and feed them something watered down, some kind of some kind of a self-help book or some kind of a denominational program or something. We're here to give you the message. And I'd like you to notice tonight what happens when you take this message and put it in a young man or a young woman's hand. It's got power in it to bind. It's got power in it to loose. Amen. Preach them the message, brothers and sisters. Give them the word. Amen. Because the faith comes by hearing that word. Oh, we need it. We need more of it. You know, so uh to think of uh how much wasted effort goes into youth ministry, filling our young people's heads full of psychology and theology and philosophy and some kind of watering down modern something. You know, that armor didn't work for Saul, you know. But Saul just looked down at a little David there and he said, "Well, well, he thinks he's something, but give him what I got. see what he can do with it. And you know, I uh this is just my personal experience. It's not gospel, but something I've observed, and maybe you would notice this, too. Wherever I've ever found a formal, starchy, intellectual, spiritually dead spirit working in a person, a church, a ministry. I also find in almost every case a disdain for young people &gt;&gt; cuz it's pride, &gt;&gt; spiritual pride. Look down and say, "Well, when you know what I know and when you quote what I can quote and when you can teach it the way that I teach it, maybe you'll be something, you know." But it ain't about what we know. Brother Brandham, this was brother Brandham's diagnosis of his own of his own people. He preached in Tucson. He said, you know, he said, I begin to look around. I begin to see people cooling off. &gt;&gt; These are message believers now. He said, the thing of it is though, it's become common to us. It's Amen. We've just known it so long, talked about it so long, &gt;&gt; made it into old dead tradition. He said, uh, but he said this message shouldn't just be the flame of the hour. We're not just here to talk about the light, &gt;&gt; he said, but it should be the flame of our hearts. [Applause] And I want to tell you something. You can sit in the seat of the scornful tonight. You can look down on these young believers. You can show me. You can show me a young man or a young woman that's gets under some wildfire. But for everyone that you show me wildfire, I'm going to find you 50 young hearts that are on fire for the message of the hour. [Music] [Applause] [Music] God's doing something this generation. It ain't a bunch of work up. It ain't a bunch of emotion. It's the flame of the hour. It's an eternal flame. Every devil out of hell will never snuff it out. But there's more behind this word of God than there is against it. Amen. I thought his brother I got so excited. Brother Josh was preaching about those chains of circumstance, how there's coming a time when that old devil that's tormenting these young people, he will be powerless. He will have no way to affect you cuz he's going to be bound by change of circumstance. He's going to have nobody to work through. But on the other side of that, we're serving a God that can never be bound by chains of circumstance, there were some Pharisees came to Jesus one time, remember? And they said, "Well, you know, you know, uh who, you know, don't you know who we are? We're, you know, we're we're a teacher so and so and we're message theologian so and so and we've been in the church 50 years and and we're we're really something and you know uh we're really something better than the next one, better than a young person. Jesus said, "You think you're somebody cuz of who your daddy was and who your grandpa was." He said, "But my God is able to take stones and make a son of Abraham. I don't care how hard you try to bind this message up with dead tradition and formal spirits and and make it cold and lukewarm and powerless. Amen. God's going to have a vessel that he can work through. And while the people sit around in their dead traditions, God's raising up young men and young women and setting them a light with the flame of the hour. Amen. keyh holders, you got something in your hand, young people. I want you to take hold of it. I want you to own this message. I want you to take this word and realize it belongs to you. It's not just the king's sword. It's your sword. I want you to swing it. I want you every every denominational traditional veil. Amen. All any kind of unbelief, anxiety, fear, worry, torment, complexness, swing that sword and don't you quit. If that devil don't move, the prophet said, "Whack him again." You got something in your hand and it can get you in there to where the presence of the Lord is. Uh, I'm so blessed by the preaching of the word tonight. Have you enjoyed? Amen. Have you been blessed? I want to thank you young people for taking this message seriously. God's moving on your behalf. Amen. We're just thankful for what he's done. So appreciate the ministry that has come this weekend to support. Brother David Siler, would you just come close in prayer, brother? We appreciate these ministers, pastors taking time out of their other responsibilities to come and show their support for you. God bless you, brother. Let's just bow our hearts. Lord, we're so thankful tonight to be able to possess the key. Lord, we are so grateful that you've called us for this day, for this time, for this hour. Lord, what a great day to be living in. Lord, when every promise is in your word, Lord, has been given to a people. And Lord, not only is it a people, we believe that we are a part of that people tonight. We thank you for every promise, Lord, for every blessing that you poured out, for every deliverance that has come tonight. Lord, we believe that we've drove the stake in the ground tonight. We're claiming what was rightfully ours. Lord, we ask that you would just bless each one, Lord, as we leave this place. Lord, we believe there's more in store. Father, the prophet said there's untapped resources yet. May we go ahead this weekend. May we tap into them, I pray. Pour yourself out among us, we ask, Lord, in a greater measure than you ever have. Make yourself known, Lord, in a greater way. We'll be so careful to give you the praise we thank you for tonight in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You're dismissed. [Music] Oh, thank you Jesus. [Music] Thank you Jesus. [Music] I thank you Jesus. Oh, thank you Jesus. Oh, thank you Jesus. [Music] Thank you Jesus. [Music] Thank you Jesus. [Music] Thank you Jesus. [Music] Lord, I love you. [Music] Oh Lord you Lord. I love you. [Music] Lord I love you. Lord, I love you. Lord, I love you. I love you. Yes, Lord. Love you.
