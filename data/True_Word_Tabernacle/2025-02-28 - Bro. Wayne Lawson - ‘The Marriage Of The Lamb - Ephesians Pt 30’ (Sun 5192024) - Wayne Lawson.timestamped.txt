[4:56] tremendous time to serve the Lord isn't
[4:58] it amen
[5:00] amen just now if we would maybe we just
[5:02] turn to the Lord let's bow our hearts
[5:05] together almighty
[5:08] god father it uh feels like maybe
[5:11] lightning is
[5:12] just moving through the building almost
[5:15] electric Lord where your presence is
[5:18] moving on hearts and lives and father I
[5:22] know Lord that when some got out of the
[5:24] bed this morning to come to church Lord
[5:27] you were already dealing with her hearts
[5:29] Lord
[5:30] already speaking Lord and the great
[5:32] needs that have been made known to you
[5:34] through prayer Lord I know that you're a
[5:37] prayer answering God now father this
[5:39] morning we have come here with one goal
[5:42] in mind Lord and that is to worship you
[5:45] and your Prophet has taught us that the
[5:47] highest form of worship is the word of
[5:49] God and we ask you now Lord that we
[5:52] enter this realm of the word may you
[5:54] Lord stand near us oh god father may you
[5:58] inspire the words that should should be
[5:59] spoken Lord and keep the words that are
[6:02] not now father we're committing this
[6:04] service to your hands and we ask you in
[6:07] the name of the Lord Jesus come take
[6:09] this take this service for your glory in
[6:12] Jesus name amen and amen and God bless
[6:17] you this morning if you have your Bibles
[6:19] I want to turn to the book of Ephesians
[6:22] uh the 5th chapter and we're going to be
[6:24] reading uh several verses here but
[6:26] verses 22 down to verse 32
[6:31] um it's a beautiful reading uh usually
[6:34] used for wedding ceremonies
[6:38] um that I would like to read it this
[6:41] morning and uh we'll be speaking here
[6:45] from this section of scripture Ephesians
[6:48] 5 and verse
[6:50] 22 now
[6:52] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[6:56] husbands as unto the
[6:58] Lord for the husband is the head of the
[7:02] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[7:05] church and he is the savior of the
[7:09] body therefore as the church is subject
[7:11] unto Christ so let the wives be to their
[7:14] own husbands in
[7:17] everything husbands love your
[7:20] wives even as Christ also love the
[7:24] church now he's teaching us how to love
[7:27] even as Christ loved the the church and
[7:31] gave himself for
[7:32] it that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[7:36] with the washing of the Water by the
[7:38] word that he might present it to himself
[7:41] a glorious
[7:42] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[7:46] such thing but that it should be holy
[7:48] and without blemish now so ought men to
[7:52] love their wives as their own bodies now
[7:55] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[7:59] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[8:03] but nourished and cherish it even as the
[8:07] Lord the church for we are members of
[8:10] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[8:14] that's powerful isn't it amen we are
[8:16] members of his body of his flesh and of
[8:19] his bones amen for this cause shall a
[8:24] man leave his father and his mother and
[8:27] shall be joined unto his wife
[8:29] and they too shall be one
[8:34] flesh this next verse this is a great
[8:38] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[8:42] and the church amen may the Lord bless
[8:45] his word as you could be seated this
[8:47] morning uh I'm going to have several
[8:50] services in this portion of scripture
[8:53] but this morning I'm going to begin with
[8:55] this area um that's it's a it's a it's
[8:58] there's a lot here uh but I'm going to
[9:00] begin in this area uh this is a great
[9:05] mystery but I speak
[9:08] concerning Christ and the church now uh
[9:12] if you're uh uh if you read the messages
[9:15] and you you follow along with the
[9:17] prophet of course in one of the sermons
[9:19] here he'll teach us uh that the end time
[9:22] message The Messer of Revelations 10:7
[9:25] that his ministry was to unfold The
[9:28] Mystery of the Bible
[9:30] that that would be the ministry that he
[9:31] would have would be to unlock uh the
[9:34] mystery of the scripture and the and
[9:37] brother brandom is listing different uh
[9:39] Mysteries and he goes into different
[9:41] Mysteries and in the fifth mystery he
[9:43] said is of the church as the bride of
[9:46] Christ in Ephesians 52832 so it's a
[9:49] great mystery of how the church is the
[9:52] bride of Christ now uh if you uh look up
[9:55] the word mystery brother Bram actually
[9:57] says this he says mystery here the
[9:59] mystery is a scripture it is previously
[10:03] hidden truth but now divinely revealed
[10:07] which is a supernatural element Still
[10:09] Remains despite the Revelation now they
[10:11] greater Mysteries and the greater
[10:13] Mysteries are and then he begins to list
[10:15] them so a mystery is a divinely revealed
[10:18] truth it's something that is written
[10:20] previously hid but now it's been
[10:22] revealed now I want to speak to you a
[10:24] little bit on this context this morning
[10:26] from this scripture and I would take a a
[10:29] Title Here If I could and for the
[10:31] context of scripture I'm want to speak
[10:32] to you about the marriage of the Lamb I
[10:35] want to talk to you about the marriage
[10:37] of the Lamb amen now in Revelation
[10:40] chapter 19 let's just read about the
[10:42] marriage Revelations 19: 5 and9 and a
[10:45] voice uh uh Revelations 19:5 and a voice
[10:49] come out of the throne saying praise our
[10:52] God all ye servants and ye that fear Him
[10:54] both small and great and I heard as it
[10:57] were the voice of a great multitude as
[11:00] the voice of many Waters and as the
[11:03] voice of Mighty thundering saying
[11:05] Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[11:09] reth let us be glad and rejoice and give
[11:13] honor to him for the marriage of the
[11:16] Lamb is come and his wife hath made
[11:20] herself ready I love this verses here
[11:23] and to her was granted it was granted
[11:26] given it was like a a present and to her
[11:29] was was granted that she should be
[11:31] arrayed in fine linen it was clean and
[11:34] white now for the fine linen is the
[11:36] righteousness of the Saints and he saith
[11:38] unto me write blessed are they which are
[11:42] called unto the marriage supper of the
[11:44] lamb now you're going to find later that
[11:46] the calling to the marriage supper of
[11:47] the Lamb is the rapture right because
[11:49] the rest of the Dead live not a thousand
[11:51] years now you see why he said blessed
[11:52] are they which are called unto the
[11:55] marriage supper of the lamb in other
[11:56] words theyve went into the Rapture amen
[11:58] and he saith unto me these are the true
[12:01] sayings of God now that's powerful amen
[12:04] these are the true sayings of God and I
[12:06] believe that it's very true this morning
[12:08] that we could announce to the church to
[12:10] the world to this age that the marriage
[12:13] of the Lamb has come now you see that
[12:18] whenever that you see it in scripture
[12:20] look how John makes it so glorious it's
[12:22] not much different than when Isaiah saw
[12:25] the coming of the Lord Jesus and he said
[12:27] well the mountains were made High the
[12:28] low and The Valleys were made High and
[12:31] the Crooked places were made straight
[12:33] and when it happened it was John the
[12:35] Baptist came and baptized Jesus and and
[12:37] made a way and here comes this man and
[12:39] so it was it was the prophecy was uh
[12:42] appeared to be speaking of one thing but
[12:45] when it happened amen everybody was
[12:47] asking who is this what does this mean
[12:49] what's taking place well to explain John
[12:52] simply said I'm the one that cometh out
[12:54] of the Wilderness to prepare away so see
[12:57] things events that transp ired in the
[13:00] days of the Lord Jesus the only thing
[13:02] they did is that they would reach in the
[13:04] scripture and then they would make what
[13:06] event happened and then they would make
[13:08] it clear now the thing is Jesus many
[13:10] times spoke to them and said I am he
[13:13] that cometh and then he he fulfilled
[13:15] scripture and then he said I'm I'm
[13:16] fulfilling scripture it is I'm doing
[13:18] this because it is written and he'll say
[13:20] because it was written was it not
[13:22] written and so what he's doing is he's
[13:24] showing the events that are happening or
[13:26] what is taking place is only make clear
[13:29] when you identify it by scripture so all
[13:32] of these great events that we have seen
[13:34] in the message of the hour we've seen
[13:36] the great crowds and we've seen the
[13:37] Messiah sign we've seen the ministry of
[13:40] William Brandon we've seen all of these
[13:41] things and people are saying what is
[13:44] this who is this what is all of this
[13:46] about I want to announce to you the
[13:48] scripture makes it clear amen it is the
[13:51] marriage of the Lamb that's what all of
[13:53] the noise is about that's why all the
[13:55] Angels that's why all the arrangements
[13:57] that's why the heaven host and it's why
[14:00] the power of God is displayed as such
[14:02] because it is the marriage of the Lamb
[14:05] amen it's the marriage of royalty it's
[14:07] the King's son and his bride amen it's
[14:11] what a powerful thing to know amen that
[14:14] there is a mystery concerning Christ and
[14:16] the church you are the Bride of Jesus
[14:19] Christ now this announcement is
[14:21] something that comes out of the throne
[14:23] am mean I think it's amazing when
[14:25] announcements are made you only listen
[14:27] to announcements as you can tell where
[14:30] they come from you know it makes a lot
[14:31] of difference who you tell of when
[14:34] something comes it's like and there's
[14:35] certain people I'm sure you all have
[14:37] them amen they'll tell you well certain
[14:39] certain thing happen this that and
[14:41] you're never going to tell that till you
[14:42] check it because you've did it before
[14:45] and found out well it wasn't just the
[14:47] way you thought you know amen so what
[14:49] you need is a good trusted source and
[14:52] and what John is saying is that the
[14:55] voice that is announcing the marriage of
[14:57] the Lamb is a voice that is come from
[14:59] the Throne of God which we can certainly
[15:02] trust the Throne of God now if you watch
[15:04] this the Bible says it amen that it was
[15:06] a voice that come out of the throne now
[15:08] I'm just going to take you on a Bible
[15:10] study for a couple moments here in
[15:12] Revelations the fourth chapter and the
[15:14] fifth verse the Bible says and out of
[15:16] the throne proceeded Lightnings and
[15:19] Thunders and voices and those voices
[15:22] watch this were the seven lamps of fire
[15:25] burning Before the Throne which are the
[15:28] seven
[15:29] spirits of God so what you're seeing is
[15:32] what is coming out of the throne and the
[15:34] voice that is announcing watch the
[15:36] scripture now and it says and that voice
[15:39] were the seven lamps of fire burning
[15:42] Before the Throne which are the seven
[15:43] spirits of God now you know God don't
[15:45] have seven spirits right amen he's just
[15:48] got one spirit that manifested
[15:50] throughout the Seven Ages amen so the
[15:53] seven spirits are just manifestation of
[15:55] one Spirit now watch the seven spirits
[15:58] Before the Throne now go to Revelations
[16:00] 1 and4 and John says to the seven
[16:02] churches which are in Asia Grace and
[16:05] peace be unto him which is which was and
[16:07] which is to come and from the seven
[16:10] spirits which are before his
[16:13] throne now in Revelation 31 it's going
[16:16] to tell you what those Spirits are and
[16:18] unto the angel of the Church of Sardis
[16:20] write these things saith he that hath
[16:23] the seven spirits of God and the Seven
[16:26] Stars amen I Know Thy Works th th as th
[16:29] name liveth and are dead now in
[16:31] Revelations 1:16 he's going to describe
[16:34] what the Seven Stars are now somebody
[16:37] say well brother Wayne this is
[16:38] Elementary maybe for you amen but
[16:40] there's new people and there's people
[16:41] that come so if you believe it I'll go
[16:44] ahead and hear an amen just now and then
[16:45] you're being so nice and listening so
[16:48] quietly but this really ain't a quiet
[16:49] church so you go ahead and amen the word
[16:52] we'll be okay amen and unto the seven
[16:54] spirits of God and the Seven Stars I
[16:57] Know Thy works and thou had name that
[16:59] thou livest but thou are dead now in
[17:01] Revelations 1:16 the Bible said that he
[17:03] had in his right hand Seven Stars now
[17:07] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[17:08] sword and his countenance was the son as
[17:11] a strange China now he had in his hand
[17:14] Seven Stars now somebody said what is
[17:16] them Seven Stars we'll look in the next
[17:18] verse it'll tell you Revelations 1 and20
[17:21] and the Mystery of the Seven Stars which
[17:23] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[17:26] Seven golden candlesticks for the Seven
[17:28] Stars s are the Angels of the seven
[17:31] churches and the Seven candlesticks
[17:34] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[17:36] so the stars in the hand are the Angels
[17:39] to the seven churches amen now what
[17:42] we're seeing then is the voice that
[17:43] comes from the throne comes to the
[17:46] church as a star or as a spirit it is
[17:50] the angel of that age and unto the angel
[17:52] of the Church of thus under the angel of
[17:55] samarina under the angel of Ephesians
[17:58] and in each one of them it's a star is
[18:01] only a symbol that's considered an angel
[18:03] is that right now an angel in our
[18:06] thoughts many time is just talking about
[18:07] a Celestial Angel which is like a
[18:10] seraphim amen or it's a cherub it's some
[18:12] kind of a Heavenly Angel but the word
[18:15] here in the Greek is not speaking of a
[18:17] Heavenly Angel it's speaking of an
[18:19] Earthly Angel amen if you if you're a
[18:22] Bible student and you carry this on to
[18:24] Revelations 19 and also to revelation 22
[18:27] you'll find that John e one of these
[18:29] angels and tries to worship that angel
[18:31] the seventh one and John said don't
[18:33] worship me I'm of one of your prophets
[18:36] I'm of your brethren John he was a
[18:39] brother of John and a prophet of the
[18:41] scripture he was the Seven Star which
[18:44] was the prophet of God that would visit
[18:46] the last day Church according to
[18:48] Revelation 3:14 unto the Seven Star the
[18:51] Church of Le oysa right now that seven
[18:54] star is the seventh angel of Revelations
[18:57] the 10th chapter and in the day when the
[19:00] voice of the seventh angel star begins
[19:03] to sound that's when the mystery of this
[19:05] whole thing shall become clear it's when
[19:08] somebody can stand on the platform and
[19:11] take the current events that are
[19:13] happening and put them right in the
[19:15] Bible and let you know this day this
[19:18] scripture is being fulfilled in your
[19:20] midst and it ought to fill our hearts
[19:22] with joy no wonder the Bible said be
[19:24] glad and rejoice for the marriage of the
[19:27] Lamb has come I'll tell tell you this
[19:29] we've got a right to Rejoice this
[19:31] morning as a Church of the Living God
[19:33] we're living in the greatest of all of
[19:35] the ages that has ever been in the
[19:37] history time of course we're excited of
[19:40] course we're in great in great
[19:42] expectation of what God would do in this
[19:45] generation because this is the season
[19:48] that God has chose he has announced it
[19:50] by the stars that we have come to the
[19:53] marriage of the lamb now if you uh if
[19:55] you look in the scripture amen you'll
[19:57] find a men that these stars are symbols
[20:01] but we all know that according to the
[20:03] Bible that in the end time there would
[20:05] become someone who would be able to take
[20:08] the symbol off of the
[20:10] scripture before the Bible was written
[20:13] it was in the mind of God right and then
[20:16] it was recorded in a symbol and then
[20:18] it's to be revealed at a latter time I
[20:20] I'll I'll say it to you like this the
[20:22] Bible said that the lamb was slain
[20:24] before the foundation of the world now
[20:27] God knew in his mind this that his name
[20:29] was Jesus and Jesus was that lamb slang
[20:32] before the world began but when they
[20:34] recorded it in the Bible they didn't say
[20:37] I'm going to send you Jesus he said a
[20:39] lamb I'm going to give a lamb and so the
[20:41] lamb was a symbol of something God had
[20:44] in his mind but it took somebody like
[20:47] that day when Philip met the unic and
[20:49] the unic was hearing and he's seeing all
[20:52] this stuff and then he starts reading
[20:53] Isaiah and said who is Isaiah talking
[20:56] about and Philip said well I'll tell you
[20:57] who it was amen it was this this man
[20:59] Jesus because now the mystery of it had
[21:02] been revealed and had been introduced by
[21:04] a prophet now I don't have time to
[21:06] preach all these subjects but I'll say
[21:08] this that God will do nothing until
[21:10] first he sends a
[21:12] prophet Amos the thir chapter and the
[21:14] seventh verse God will do nothing until
[21:16] first he sends a prophet why did Jesus
[21:19] go to John in the water why did Jesus go
[21:23] to John in the water and he said Lord I
[21:25] have need to be baptized the he said
[21:26] suffer to be so John for it ful it
[21:29] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[21:32] why did John have to baptize Jesus
[21:35] because the word Jesus is the word has
[21:37] to come to a prophet why didn't Jesus go
[21:40] down to the Pharisees and say hey I'm
[21:42] here it it's because it's not the
[21:45] channel God chose he chose for the word
[21:48] to come to the prophet and the prophet
[21:50] introduced the Messiah and that day
[21:53] Elijah did it in this day there's
[21:55] another Elijah that has introduced Jesus
[21:58] Christ to this generation amen you see
[22:01] what it is it's an announcement now amen
[22:04] I know that when the when the when the
[22:05] seals opened up and the Thunder sounded
[22:08] it revealed the symbology the The Book
[22:10] of Revelations which was written to the
[22:12] bride I don't have time to preach all
[22:14] these areas but you know it that the
[22:15] bride's book is the Book of Revelations
[22:17] right wrote in symbol form and hid until
[22:20] the time the Bride come on the earth
[22:22] that's why you have a message is because
[22:25] the trans revealing of this message is
[22:28] what brings the revelation of the symbol
[22:30] on the Book of Revelations is that right
[22:33] now now now when that symbol becomes now
[22:36] you read it it's a different Bible to
[22:38] you we didn't need a new Bible we didn't
[22:42] need a new translation of the Bible we
[22:44] needed to understand the Bible we were
[22:47] reading is that right amen now when you
[22:50] read Seven Stars and you start reading
[22:52] them I I was preaching the convention
[22:54] one time and and I was preaching on the
[22:56] Seven Stars in the right hand and I was
[22:57] talking about God stars and his angels
[23:00] and I just read the scripture like it
[23:02] would be read in our generation and
[23:05] instead of saying under the angel of
[23:06] Ephesus I write I just said unto Paul I
[23:10] write because that's really what was in
[23:13] the mind of God when he put to the angel
[23:15] of Ephesus he really meant unto Paul
[23:18] that was the meaning of the scripture
[23:20] and I just went through the seven Church
[23:22] age Messengers like that and I said but
[23:24] you know when it comes to that seven
[23:26] star that's where the real Trouble Comes
[23:28] as that seven star was a man named
[23:30] William brandom that's where the real
[23:32] trouble is cuz I I've learned something
[23:34] man the devil can't take the name of
[23:36] that Prophet I tell you what it's it's
[23:38] rough on that devil and I tell you why I
[23:40] I mean I don't blame him cuz he's took a
[23:42] weapon everywhere that Prophet ever went
[23:44] the devil took a real
[23:45] weapon amen I remember years ago guy was
[23:48] down in Mexico and he was preaching a
[23:49] meeting and running to a devil he
[23:51] couldn't cast out and he said he didn't
[23:53] know what to do and inspiration came so
[23:54] he reached over and picked a book of
[23:56] brother randoms up and turned around and
[23:58] and he said he held up that book and he
[24:00] said' do you know who this is the devil
[24:01] and the devil said yeah he said' that
[24:03] man's name is William brandom he cast me
[24:05] out of a meeting in Jonesboro Arkansas
[24:07] years ago and that devil had to
[24:09] recognize that was a prophet now now
[24:12] some of the Christian people don't know
[24:13] it but the devil knows it the devil
[24:16] knows it's real amen now now I'm saying
[24:19] that because amen you can quote anybody
[24:22] you want to just don't quote brother
[24:24] random you can quote Paul you quote
[24:26] Peter you quote James you can quote any
[24:28] of the early Apostles you can quote
[24:30] Moses you can amen you can call it the
[24:32] word of God but when you quote William
[24:34] brandom all the devils in Hell start
[24:36] cankering up you ever notice we can
[24:38] quote Billy Graham we can quote uh
[24:39] Church Hill we can you know I mean I did
[24:42] it myself we fought them on the beaches
[24:44] and we'll fight them in the in the Sands
[24:46] we'll fight them on the waters but we
[24:48] will never surrender amen Church Hill
[24:50] gave that as a vday speech and and and
[24:53] and and and beat the Germans in in
[24:55] England by the words that he spoke and
[24:58] we've all used them and we've inspired
[25:00] people by them amen but that was nothing
[25:03] to be compared with a voice coming out
[25:06] of the Throne of God and unto the angel
[25:09] of the Church of the L de seea can I say
[25:12] it the way it was written unto William
[25:14] brandom I say I Rite unto thee I was
[25:18] preaching a meeting and I was in Norway
[25:20] and there was a lady there that was
[25:22] suffering with leukemia cancer she was
[25:24] in bad shape she was really bad shape
[25:26] and when I was preaching it took me a
[25:27] year to find out this testimony but when
[25:29] I was preaching that sermon I announced
[25:31] the seven star was a man named William
[25:33] brandham A year later that woman found
[25:35] me when I come back to do the camp she
[25:37] said brother Wayne last year when you
[25:38] preached here I was so sick with
[25:40] leukemia I said I remember she said when
[25:42] you announced the seven star was a man
[25:45] named William brandom she said there was
[25:47] a warm sensation that started at the top
[25:49] of my head and went come through my body
[25:52] she said brother Wayne I am completely
[25:54] healed of leukemia I never laid a hand
[25:57] on the woman I never even knew she was I
[25:59] never knew how even to touch her she was
[26:02] in the back of the building but the
[26:04] power of the word of God being received
[26:06] gave her a deliverance and I tell you
[26:08] this morning the same God that was in
[26:11] that meeting in Norway is in this
[26:13] meeting in true Earth Tabernacle this
[26:15] morning amen my God is not going to
[26:18] leave this message there is an angel
[26:21] Covenant angel that walks with this
[26:23] message in the last days I'll tell you
[26:26] see when the Holy Spirit the devil can't
[26:28] stand this anointing the devil can't
[26:30] stand this this season that we're living
[26:32] in now the authority of the five-fold
[26:35] ministry is an authority that comes from
[26:38] being under a messenger that's right
[26:41] when I say things with such Authority
[26:43] concerning scripture it's not because I
[26:46] uh uh that I conveyed with the biggest
[26:48] Bible schools or I'm not coming with a
[26:51] doctorate that some educator gave me
[26:53] where 500 men got together and decided
[26:56] that certain scripture meant a certain
[26:58] thing cuz I found out the Bible said let
[27:00] every man's word be a lie that the word
[27:03] of God remains true there is no private
[27:06] interpretation of the word of God but
[27:08] God will bring it to pass and when God
[27:10] brings it to pass it is a clear
[27:13] interpretation and Vindication of what
[27:15] you're reading amen has been written
[27:18] there has never been anything like it in
[27:20] the history of the world to give the
[27:22] Church of God in Authority we should not
[27:24] be ashamed of this gospel and may I say
[27:27] this I am not ashamed of this gospel I
[27:30] am not ashamed of the name of William
[27:32] brandom or the seven star and the
[27:35] seventh angel or a prophet of God I'm
[27:37] not ashamed because I'm not confused
[27:39] about it I know where it came from I
[27:42] know what it's done for my life and if
[27:44] you begin to believe I know what it can
[27:46] do for your life it'll bring families
[27:49] back together again it'll bring healing
[27:51] in homes it'll bring victory in churches
[27:54] it'll destroy depression Spirits it'll
[27:56] get anxiety away from from you many
[27:59] people are suffering with confusion
[28:00] today and anxiety because the devil has
[28:03] robbed from them the foundational truth
[28:06] that a prophet of God is visited this
[28:08] generation why do you think Satan
[28:10] attacks a prophet so hard why do you
[28:13] really think it is you think he's trying
[28:15] to help you oh I'll tell you the devil
[28:17] come to steal kill and destroy all he's
[28:19] come to do is Rob you of the good things
[28:21] of your life amen I'll show you one
[28:24] thing and I'll carry on but I'll tell
[28:25] you this when Elisha was down there with
[28:28] haa remember that amen the Syrian Army
[28:30] wasn't worried about the Israel army
[28:33] they could care less about the Israel
[28:34] army because they thought they could
[28:36] trick them and outsmart them and so can
[28:39] the devil trick you and outsmart you but
[28:41] God had a prophet there and he was
[28:43] saying don't go down that street because
[28:45] the Syrian Army is waiting on you and
[28:47] don't go behind that Hill because the
[28:49] Syrian Army it got so bad the king of
[28:51] the syan army said we got a spy Among Us
[28:54] he said the people said no everybody's
[28:57] faithful here got a prophet among them
[28:59] he's telling them what you're saying in
[29:01] your bed Chambers so the King was not
[29:04] Waring against Israel's Army he began a
[29:08] war against God's prophet and so is the
[29:10] devil in this end time started a war
[29:13] against God's Prophet but let me tell
[29:15] you something we've already won the
[29:17] battle the faith is in my heart this
[29:20] morning I believe this message and the
[29:23] devil can't take it away from me it
[29:25] belongs to me it's been Vindicated it's
[29:28] real it's true this is my message this
[29:31] is my age this come for me Hallelujah
[29:36] somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I
[29:38] tell you I would have believed it in
[29:39] another time you will amen are showing
[29:41] this
[29:42] morning exactly what you would have been
[29:45] in another day right that's because
[29:47] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[29:52] forever the authority of this five-fold
[29:54] ministry comes from being under an
[29:58] authoritative word sent by God's Own
[30:02] Way just as men who were under Martin
[30:05] Luther could preach justification by
[30:08] faith hallelujah how they could go out
[30:10] in the streets in the face of Catholic
[30:13] dogmas isn't it amazing they could stand
[30:16] in the face of that entire Catholic
[30:18] church and just homegrown Guys Without
[30:20] educations or anything God under the
[30:22] influence of Martin Luther and they'd
[30:24] run around and tell people who were
[30:26] trying to gain amen their Grace from God
[30:29] by beating and hurting and and they
[30:31] could preach to them the Justified are
[30:33] justified by the faith in the cross of
[30:36] Jesus Christ oh they had Authority oh
[30:38] they had power they just had a couple
[30:41] scriptures amen but they were under an
[30:43] authority the same John Wesley's
[30:45] Ministry that came behind him taught
[30:48] that amen God would sanctify a Believer
[30:50] and look at the power of the Pentecostal
[30:52] Revival broke out in 1906 with the
[30:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost begin to fall
[30:57] and look how it broke out across the
[30:59] Nations and look how it begin to cause
[31:01] all the situation turn the world upside
[31:04] down and they done it on Acts 2 and 4
[31:06] acts 238 and Acts 19 well think about it
[31:10] they had one scripture amen I'll tell
[31:12] you this amen they had a rumor that he
[31:14] was alive amen they had a couple of
[31:17] scriptures in the day of Pentecost but
[31:19] this bride has received an open book
[31:22] with an authoritative prophet of God and
[31:25] he said this day this scripture and he's
[31:28] gave you your place he's gave you your
[31:30] position oh Church of the Living God I
[31:32] say devil get out of the way as a bride
[31:35] upon the Earth and knows who she is what
[31:38] she's here for what she stands
[31:40] for
[31:43] hallelujah hallelujah somebody said
[31:46] what's all of this about Paul wrote it
[31:48] in Romans 7 we wouldn't have knew it had
[31:50] a prophet not picked it up but in Romans
[31:52] the 7th chapter Paul wrote it when he
[31:55] said that a woman if she has a living
[31:57] husband
[31:58] is bound to that man as long as he lives
[32:02] but when he died she is loose from the
[32:05] law of her husband now you know what the
[32:07] prophet said you might think that's
[32:09] about marriage and divorce he said but
[32:11] it's a prophecy for the last day listen
[32:14] to me The Modern event is made clear by
[32:18] that prophecy Pentecost the movement of
[32:20] Pentecost died dead it's dead we are
[32:24] loosed from the former ideas of what God
[32:27] is and how God does and we have been
[32:30] moved under a message of the hour listen
[32:33] and everything that was good in
[32:35] Pentecost is in this message we didn't
[32:37] lose nothing folks we gained something
[32:40] we gained a husband we gained somebody
[32:43] that could give us life somebody could
[32:46] give us seed Hallelujah modern event
[32:49] made clear the denomination is dead dead
[32:52] the revivals are dead oh amen but when
[32:56] God let it die I'm I'm quoting the
[32:58] prophet God let it die but he let it die
[33:01] to loose
[33:03] you that you might be married to the new
[33:06] anointed word of the age Hallelujah you
[33:10] can accept the prophet's message because
[33:13] Pentecost died but there was a message
[33:16] for a bride and it was coming for a
[33:18] marriage this ain't coming just for a
[33:21] good time it's coming for a marriage
[33:24] it's not coming just for a furter it's
[33:26] coming for a marriage
[33:28] oh hallelujah amen amen Hey Brother bam
[33:31] said it like this he said I can only
[33:33] take one home one one one woman home
[33:35] with me today I can only take one home
[33:37] with me he said there's only one miss
[33:39] William Brown oh he said and there's
[33:41] only one miss Jesus Christ listen let me
[33:44] tell you something I would not leave my
[33:46] wife here no more than God would leave
[33:50] his life can you think about that that
[33:52] God would leave us here for tribulation
[33:55] that he would leave us here for listen
[33:57] he's not going to leave you he's not
[34:00] going to forget you he's not going to
[34:02] forsake you come on as the Bride of
[34:05] Jesus Christ The Rapture is our
[34:11] home well somebody shout
[34:14] hallelujah tell that devil I know who I
[34:18] am hallelujah it's a modern event make
[34:22] clear by the prophecy what is happening
[34:25] Brother Wayne Romans 7 Revelations
[34:28] 19 just as Jesus walked on the road with
[34:31] a two to
[34:33] amus it was prophecy that he was making
[34:37] not all the prophecy is written we know
[34:40] that right like it's not just a prophet
[34:42] saying sayith the Lord this shall happen
[34:45] this shall happen this shall happen but
[34:47] the actions of men in the Bible were
[34:51] prophecy Joseph's whole
[34:53] life was
[34:56] prophecy poor man nobody was following
[34:58] him around telling him hey you're a type
[35:00] of Jesus and when he was down there
[35:03] laying on that hard bed in prison and he
[35:05] was cold and hungry and mistreated and
[35:07] persecuted he didn't have anybody
[35:08] sitting there saying it'll be okay it'll
[35:11] be okay your life's being lived out is a
[35:13] prophecy amen do you know it was
[35:16] literally hundreds of years later when
[35:19] Jesus came that they even understood the
[35:23] life of Joseph nobody understood the
[35:26] life of Joseph and until Jesus came and
[35:29] then the prophecy become clear in the
[35:33] manifestation I say that because Jesus
[35:36] walked with two on the road to EMAs and
[35:38] he appeared to them after the
[35:40] resurrection which we are after the
[35:43] resurrection and he appeared to them
[35:45] himself which is prophecy the Lord shall
[35:48] appear himself 1 Thessalonians 4 says
[35:52] the Lord himself shall appear Among Us 1
[35:54] John chapter 3 said the Lord shall
[35:57] appear and and we shall be like him amen
[35:59] he shall appear Among Us now we say
[36:02] brother Wayne what is this coming Among
[36:03] Us you got to read Luke 24 to understand
[36:06] it that Jesus appeared to them in
[36:08] another form and they didn't know who
[36:11] they were walking with but in the
[36:14] evening of the third day amen he took
[36:18] them in a room and he broke the bread to
[36:20] them and they saw that this is him that
[36:24] has risen from the dead he is Jesus
[36:27] that's who is I say to you this morning
[36:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[36:32] forever and if you're wondering what the
[36:34] meeting is about it's him it's him he's
[36:37] came Among Us in the power of his
[36:40] resurrection to take over bodies as a
[36:43] member of his pride to claim you by
[36:46] Authority amen I tell you what amen I
[36:49] love the part of this when they when
[36:51] Luke 24 when they got excited at his
[36:53] resurrection they had to go tell
[36:55] somebody and the Bible said they ran
[36:57] back
[36:59] they walked over and they ran back let
[37:01] me tell you if you see what they say you
[37:03] might have drove over but you'll run
[37:05] back amen you might have come in in in
[37:08] in in disturbance and you might have
[37:09] come with your head down but if you
[37:11] catch what I'm saying to you this
[37:13] morning you go home with joy unspeakable
[37:17] and full of Glory you are in the
[37:19] presence of the Messiah himself he has
[37:25] risen Hallelujah
[37:28] look what happened when they when they
[37:30] went in that room and those men ran back
[37:32] and they told their friends and while
[37:35] they were telling it what's the Bible
[37:36] say he appeared among them
[37:39] again the same one that was in that room
[37:43] he was telling about it again and there
[37:45] he showed up again and let me say
[37:47] something to you this morning the
[37:48] prophet of God said when you talk about
[37:50] him he comes near when you start talking
[37:53] about him he's come present I believe we
[37:56] are standing in the presence of Jesus
[37:59] Christ this morning and the power of
[38:01] that Resurrection has come to give life
[38:04] and strength Hallelujah he's not a

[42:13] the body change
[42:17] lied hey that's the Bible we all read
[42:20] it Abraham lied after the body
[42:24] change about his wife Sarah and no words
[42:27] in scripture do you find God coming to
[42:29] him and tell him if you don't repent I
[42:31] ain't going to give you a
[42:32] child on contrary he tells that King if
[42:36] you don't give the woman back and and
[42:38] repent to this man and have him pray
[42:40] have that liar pray for
[42:42] you I'm going to shut up every womb in
[42:45] your kingdom listen I'm telling you
[42:47] you're under a covenant you're under a
[42:49] promise you're under the anointing and
[42:52] there's not enough Devils to take away
[42:54] the promised Covenant when God said who
[42:57] I bless that shall I bless let me say to
[43:00] this blessed are they which are called
[43:02] under the marriage supper of the Lamb
[43:04] blessings upon blessings have come upon
[43:07] Our
[43:09] Lives Hallelujah you visitors forgive me
[43:12] I'm actually behaving myself a little
[43:14] from what I feel right now Hallelujah
[43:17] there a covenant and God's made it with
[43:22] us the headship and the body have become
[43:25] one what is it
[43:27] amen it's an announcement that the hour
[43:29] has
[43:30] come if you're reading the first seal
[43:32] brother random is trying to explain
[43:34] Revelations the 10th chapter and he says
[43:37] in
[43:37] there if you've had a question as you're
[43:41] reading Revelations 10 the Bible said in
[43:42] the seven Thunders Ed The Voice John was
[43:44] about to write
[43:45] it the angel said don't write it seal
[43:51] it until
[43:53] when until the doctors of divinity get
[43:56] together and put school
[43:59] together until the Baptist educate their
[44:03] professors now I not what he said the
[44:06] Bible said until the seventh angel
[44:11] sounds oh I love the word of
[44:14] God now when that seventh angel was
[44:16] sounding do you think he knew what the
[44:19] Thunders
[44:20] were I'm I'm sincere do you think
[44:23] William brandom knew what the Thunders
[44:25] were when the seal he said if you've
[44:28] wondered what it was turn to John 12 and
[44:32] read it you won't have to wonder
[44:34] anymore Hallelujah you're talking about
[44:37] shutting up all the Giants and the doctr
[44:39] of
[44:40] divinity here's a prophet saying it
[44:43] happened in John the 12th chapter when
[44:45] the Bible said Jesus said father glorify
[44:47] my name thy name and me and and and the
[44:50] Bible said that it thundered from the
[44:53] heavens see God spoke from the heavens
[44:54] and said I have glorified thy name and I
[44:57] shall glorify it again right and the
[45:01] Bible
[45:02] says that a voice
[45:05] spoke but people heard a
[45:10] thunder and Jesus said the voice came
[45:12] not for your sake but for my
[45:15] sake he heard a voice they heard a
[45:20] thunder the seven Thunders folks the
[45:24] word Thunder is only a symbol for
[45:29] voice it's the voice of God that's why
[45:32] brother brandom says it will take the
[45:34] seven Thunders to wake her up it will
[45:37] take the voice of God to wake her
[45:41] up come on y'all know the quote no
[45:43] manifestations have given the bride
[45:45] Revival is that what he said third seal
[45:48] 1963 Dead's been raised greatest
[45:51] conventions in the world's been held T
[45:52] revivals amen healings all over the
[45:54] world he said no Revival yet nothing to
[45:57] stir up the bride yet it'll take those
[45:59] seven unknown Thunders listen now
[46:01] brother random wasn't he knew what he
[46:02] was talking
[46:03] about he was his ministry God was using
[46:07] but he said it don't wake the bride
[46:08] what's happens not woke the bride up but
[46:11] it'll take those seven unknown Thunders
[46:13] and he knew that it was his job and he
[46:16] was doing it right
[46:18] then because in 1964 he turned around he
[46:21] said the problem with these Pentecostals
[46:23] is they're praying and fasting asking
[46:24] for a Great Awakening he says and they
[46:27] missed
[46:28] it they have missed the Awakening of the
[46:32] Bride so something happened back there
[46:34] in them
[46:36] seals that they miss so watch the noise
[46:39] of a thunder it is the voice of God now
[46:42] I'm only making that clear because let
[46:44] us find the symbols we find out what
[46:46] Thunders means in first seal paragraph
[46:48] 262 the Thunder was the voice of God
[46:52] when the seal
[46:53] opened see a seal makes something a
[46:55] mystery in other words I can't explain
[46:57] it cuz it's a mystery but when I speak
[47:00] what the mystery is the mystery's
[47:03] gone because you've heard a clear
[47:06] sounding voice it told you exactly what
[47:09] it was and here we are in this age with
[47:12] a
[47:13] prophet look now we've got we've got
[47:16] Ecclesiastes in the Greek we've got
[47:18] Ecclesiastes we got
[47:20] church but now the prophet's going to
[47:22] come and talk about this term called
[47:25] bride
[47:27] amen and it's in the first seal that he
[47:29] says I'm going to call you bride so you
[47:35] understand what he's saying is there's
[47:37] something God had in his mind and it's
[47:40] been sealed mystery all these ages but
[47:43] now I'm going to be able to reveal to
[47:46] you that you are what the Bible was
[47:49] talking about is setting right here amen
[47:53] what is he talking about he's talking
[47:55] about his own Ministry now now in the
[47:57] message of Shame brother brandom is uh
[47:59] brother Bram gets in a lot of he's in a
[48:01] lot of uh discomfort in the message of
[48:03] shame because he's having a lot of times
[48:06] and he's having these dreams and in
[48:08] these dreams brother BR he keeps telling
[48:10] them and that I'm dreaming that I'm
[48:12] slacking off on the job basically and he
[48:14] said I'm looking for what is that
[48:17] something's going to tell me what it is
[48:18] so I can so I can uh uh so I can know I
[48:22] can get this confusion off of me he said
[48:24] so I got up in the morning one morning
[48:26] and he said Lord you're going to have to
[48:27] give me something and he said now I'm
[48:29] I'm encouraging you not to do this guys
[48:31] he said but but I did this because of
[48:34] course it's his office right and he said
[48:36] I did this and asked the Lord to give me
[48:38] something in the word so it would answer
[48:40] what's going on with me and he said when
[48:42] I let the Bible fall open he said it
[48:45] fell open to Genesis 24 and verse
[48:48] 7 now if you're a Bible reader you know
[48:51] Genesis 24 is after the death of
[48:55] Sarah Abraham's wife life it's when
[48:58] Isaac is going to take a
[49:00] bride it's the longest chapter in the
[49:04] book of Genesis and isn't it odd that
[49:06] God would devote so much of the Bible on
[49:09] Isaac taking a wife now the reason being
[49:13] is is because Isaac was going to type
[49:16] Jesus and Rebecca was going to type The
[49:20] Perfect Bride so what God's intention
[49:24] his entire goal of scri
[49:27] scripture is to take a bride for Jesus
[49:31] that is the goal of scripture that is
[49:33] the that is the greatest point of
[49:35] scripture that is the great mystery
[49:38] which has been hid in God is the mystery
[49:40] of redemption of him bringing his bride
[49:43] home amen now now when you start seeing
[49:45] this you'll see that's why that it's the
[49:48] longest chapter in the Bible because it
[49:50] is a very important chapter and when
[49:52] brother random let the scripture fall
[49:54] open here we are in and he's in the year
[49:57] of
[49:58] 1964
[50:00] 65 and he's now being taken to the
[50:04] chapters of Genesis
[50:06] 24 when Abraham would send a servant
[50:10] after this
[50:11] bride now it's powerful if it's a if
[50:14] it's a if it's a if you're a Bible
[50:16] reader it's a powerful read and I would
[50:18] encourage you to go read the entire
[50:20] chapter we don't have time this morning
[50:22] but if you're a Bible reader go read
[50:24] that entire chapter and see that there
[50:26] was a
[50:28] discussion between elizar faithful
[50:31] servant of Abraham and Abraham about his
[50:35] position with Abraham now he was a
[50:37] faithful servant and the Bible tells us
[50:39] that he held everything that Abraham had
[50:43] he was faithful in all things so he sent
[50:46] his faithful servant to retrieve a wife
[50:49] for his son Isaac can you imagine can
[50:51] you imagine guys your dad going sending
[50:53] some not himself but sending somebody go
[50:55] get a a wife for my son
[50:57] son amen but see this man was well
[51:00] trained in the house he knew exactly
[51:03] what they were looking for and he was
[51:06] sent on this long journey and he was
[51:09] going to get a wife now he actually he
[51:12] actually has some uh doubts about his
[51:14] ability because he says to Abraham he
[51:16] says well how do I know that I'll get
[51:18] the right one and how do I know that
[51:21] she'll come with me and how do I know
[51:23] she'll believe what I said and and and
[51:25] when he starts saying this Abraham turn
[51:27] says well look the god that brought me
[51:29] to this land he shall send that angel
[51:34] before
[51:35] thee and he shall do the work now it's a
[51:38] powerful lesson here because the angel
[51:41] went before Abraham now the angel now
[51:44] you know here is speaking of the Angel
[51:47] of the Covenant which is the pillar of
[51:49] fire that later leads the children of
[51:52] Abraham from Goa all the way to the
[51:55] promised land but here this Angel was
[51:58] specifically going before elaser now
[52:02] listen friends that's the angel of the
[52:04] Covenant that is the pillar of fire
[52:06] right and it's going to go out in front
[52:08] of
[52:09] Isaac and it's going to speak to hearts
[52:11] and then Isa or excuse me elaser and
[52:14] then elzer is going to speak with him
[52:15] now that's the same
[52:18] one that brother brandom identifies in
[52:21] the end time as the picture of the Angel
[52:24] of the Lord the angel Angel of the Lord
[52:27] went with elaser to find a
[52:30] bride in the end time we have another El
[52:34] are and the father has sent the same
[52:41] Angel the same angel that picked out
[52:45] Isaac's wife in the
[52:47] Bible is the same angel that will pick
[52:51] out the Bride In the End
[52:54] Time Elie
[52:57] was in that day but the Bible doesn't
[52:59] call him elaser how many knows that how
[53:02] many knows Genesis 24 never says his
[53:04] name's elaser actually I had a Critic
[53:06] bring that up one time and I thought
[53:07] well glory to God I love this because
[53:09] they they meant it as a criticism and I
[53:12] started laughing I said well being
[53:13] there's no name there then that was the
[53:16] point that God left it open to let you
[53:18] know he wasn't exactly speaking of
[53:20] elaser he's talking of the end time he's
[53:23] that's why the Bible said amen that in
[53:26] the when the Luke 24 remember he it's
[53:28] cleopas and his friend it never says who
[53:30] the other guy is cuz he's talking about
[53:32] you he's talking about the friend of the
[53:35] Bride you can put yourself in the vision
[53:37] when there's no name there easily you
[53:39] can go in the v and here here elaser
[53:42] fits right in scripture and he goes for
[53:44] the same
[53:47] Angel the Bible the Bible predicts that
[53:50] the angel goes before him brother Bram
[53:52] told us how long half
[53:55] hour well I don't know about you guys
[53:57] but Revelations 8 is pretty powerful and
[53:59] you start thinking about half hours but
[54:02] anyhow but it went about a half hour out
[54:04] in front of him and it was it was it was
[54:07] it was making her heart ready to receive
[54:11] now here's the
[54:12] thing uh brother Andrew Glover said
[54:14] something down the tent meetings which I
[54:15] thought was powerful some of you I'm
[54:16] sure you wasn't there even heard it but
[54:18] I I'll just repeat it I thought was so
[54:20] good he actually talked about the angel
[54:23] uh softening the heart
[54:26] uh and and what he was referring to was
[54:29] that that Heathen that was on the porch
[54:31] there in Kentucky that squirrel Hunter
[54:33] remember the
[54:34] story and when he started talking to
[54:36] brother brandham he was calling brother
[54:37] Bram a lion a lion preacher he said
[54:39] these bunch of lion dogs these preachers
[54:41] because they're always talking about
[54:42] something that we don't think's there
[54:44] talk about God and brother brandham said
[54:47] to him you think all preachers are like
[54:49] that he said well there's just one now
[54:51] that I'd like to meet his name's
[54:54] brandom and he said why would you like
[54:56] to meet him he said because there was a
[54:57] lady up the hill here a few years ago
[54:59] that had cancer and this man came and
[55:02] held a meeting down here and he called
[55:05] out her sister and told her what was
[55:07] wrong with her sister she was dying with
[55:09] cancer and said you got a hanky in your
[55:11] pocket take that hankerchief and go up
[55:13] there and lay it on her and she'll be
[55:15] completely healed and he said that night
[55:17] we heard sound like Salvation Army was
[55:19] up there said screaming and hollering
[55:21] and he said so I told the wife next
[55:23] morning we'll get the uh wagon go up and
[55:25] get her said when we got up there he
[55:27] said preacher you ain't going to believe
[55:28] us but she was sitting at her table
[55:30] eating
[55:31] breakfast he brother B said you don't
[55:36] say what was look now had that man met
[55:41] brother brandham
[55:43] prior prior to that story he would have
[55:47] called brother random a lion dog too but
[55:50] the angel of the Lord had already been
[55:52] up on that Hillside and already prepared
[55:55] that man's heart and he was sitting
[55:57] there wanting to meet brother brandom
[55:59] listen I'm talking about a god this
[56:01] morning that's prepared your heart at
[56:03] points in your life and made you thirsty
[56:06] for an oldfashioned meeting with the
[56:08] Holy Ghost and an experience with God
[56:10] something in you says there's a God
[56:12] somewhere there's a truth somewhere
[56:15] there's a holy ghost somewhere amen
[56:17] that's the grace of God that came to you
[56:20] [Applause]
[56:22] first and Rebecca what she would have
[56:25] she would have turned that down flat but
[56:27] the angel got there in front of
[56:31] him now there's a great Point here I
[56:33] like brother Ram makes a great point of
[56:35] it and he says that the the messenger
[56:38] came in the
[56:40] evening Zachariah the Bible says that in
[56:44] the evening
[56:45] time there shall be light if you was
[56:49] here last Sunday we went into that quite
[56:50] heavily there should be scriptures being
[56:52] fulfilled in the evening now watch here
[56:54] elaser comes in the evening to a woman
[56:57] who's already communing with an
[56:59] angel the Great Commission upon him is
[57:02] to receive a bride for Isaac and he is
[57:05] strictly told you must take one who is
[57:09] of our
[57:10] lineage you must have a seed line who is
[57:14] my seed line and it even went into
[57:16] conversation and elaser says to him he
[57:19] says look Abraham if I can't get one to
[57:21] come should I take Isaac down there he
[57:23] said no Isaac won't return
[57:26] the bride's going to come to
[57:29] him well you're
[57:33] quiet I thought I heard brother Bram say
[57:36] something like that his feet won't touch
[57:39] this Earth until the
[57:42] Millennium that the bride would go up to
[57:45] him in the
[57:47] air so if you're not willing to
[57:50] go he's not coming back to the Earth for
[57:53] a bride in his physical body he's going
[57:56] to meet his bride in the
[57:58] [Applause]
[58:00] air the only way that this woman would
[58:04] ever meet Isaac was through this
[58:08] servant you can throw him away if you
[58:10] want to but I know he was my ride to my
[58:14] husband
[58:16] man when he started talking to her I
[58:19] think it's amazing brother Bram lays it
[58:21] out beautifully in a message called time
[58:22] of decision he said that elaser decided
[58:25] to trust
[58:27] God not Creeds so he knelt down next to
[58:31] the well and said Lord the woman who's
[58:33] supposed to marry Isaac now he lays out
[58:37] how she's going to respond I thought it
[58:39] was powerful when you uh when you
[58:41] actually go into the to the powerful
[58:43] point of it in the in the fact that he
[58:45] knows her response and he actually says
[58:47] she'll come out and she'll see me here
[58:49] and she I'll ask her for a drink and
[58:53] then when I ask her for a drink then
[58:56] she'll offer me the drink and when she
[58:59] offers me the drink then she'll say I
[59:02] also water your
[59:04] camels now when she came out Ken's a
[59:08] powerful story because he doesn't tell
[59:10] her the whole
[59:12] Revelation all he does when this woman
[59:15] comes out she comes out in the evening
[59:17] time now now do do you think this is
[59:19] fixed up do you think this there's no
[59:22] internet there's no wifi there's no
[59:24] telephones
[59:27] now how did she know to come to the well
[59:29] at that moment and how did he know to be
[59:32] at that well at that time because God
[59:36] has Junctions of times that he
[59:38] orchestrates and he puts people in the
[59:40] right place at the right
[59:42] time and while they were there at the
[59:45] right place at the right time I hope
[59:46] you're hearing me don't you know that
[59:48] God knew you'd be sitting in this seat
[59:50] this morning he'd be sitting right here
[59:53] in this church hearing this sermon this
[59:55] morning yes right and you know what he
[59:58] did he actually prayed said Lord let her
[59:59] respond this way and he asked her for a
[1:00:01] drink when he asked her for a drink she
[1:00:03] then gave him a drink and replied and
[1:00:06] I'll Water your camels
[1:00:08] also
[1:00:10] Hallelujah now that was what he asked
[1:00:12] for wasn't it he wanted that response
[1:00:14] but he didn't tell her how to respond
[1:00:16] she knew how to respond and that's a
[1:00:18] powerful thing because something was in
[1:00:20] her to tell her how to respond to that
[1:00:22] now if you're if you're a Bible student
[1:00:24] you know that brother Adam says any
[1:00:26] Beast is a symbol of power and he said
[1:00:30] just as the Harlot rides a Scarlet made
[1:00:33] Beast he said that's the power the Roman
[1:00:35] Church has he said so is this Campell a
[1:00:38] representation that what brought elaser
[1:00:41] to the well was the power of the Holy
[1:00:43] Ghost and he said and here it is Rebecca
[1:00:47] was going to ride those camels back to
[1:00:50] meet Isaac now now the prophet lays it
[1:00:53] out he said do you see there she was
[1:00:55] ready to water the power that would
[1:00:57] carry her if the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:00] brought William brandom if same power of
[1:01:03] the Holy Ghost is going to take this
[1:01:05] bride off of the earth listen doctrines
[1:01:07] of divinities are not going to give you
[1:01:09] the power for it psychology is not going
[1:01:12] to do it for you church membership is
[1:01:14] not going to do it but the power of the
[1:01:16] Holy Ghost is the only thing that can
[1:01:19] break the gravity of this lay out to see
[1:01:22] an age and put you in the presence of
[1:01:24] God and I'll tell you this one thing we
[1:01:26] found out you got to draw water from the
[1:01:28] well amen and sometimes you come in the
[1:01:31] house of God it's not that way this
[1:01:32] morning it's real easy amen but
[1:01:34] sometimes you come in the house of God
[1:01:36] and you need a water out of that well
[1:01:38] what that means is you need to work a
[1:01:39] little bit sometimes you need to amen
[1:01:42] when you don't feel it and sometimes you
[1:01:44] need to wave your hand when you don't
[1:01:46] feel it and sometimes you need to say
[1:01:48] praise the Lord when you don't feel it
[1:01:51] because I'll tell you this if you start
[1:01:53] out just a little it'll feel real good
[1:01:55] after a while brother B said I come in a
[1:01:58] meeting one time he said I come in that
[1:02:00] meeting he said I thought what a bunch
[1:02:02] of crazy people he said but the longer I
[1:02:04] sit there oh he said the better it felt
[1:02:07] I tell you this listen this morning
[1:02:09] there's a God Amen that comes on the
[1:02:11] scene when people begin to praise the
[1:02:14] Lord it is the watering of the camels
[1:02:17] come on Rebecca I know you're in this
[1:02:19] building this morning and somebody's
[1:02:21] going to water the camels of the Holy
[1:02:24] Ghost I'll tell you what I I'm not going
[1:02:26] to sit down shut up I'm not going to
[1:02:28] quit praising God as long as I got a
[1:02:30] voice in my body I'll say praise the
[1:02:33] Lord hallelujah glory to God you can
[1:02:36] think I'm a maniac a loud man a quiet
[1:02:38] but think anything you want to about me
[1:02:41] cuz I'm going to tell you this what's
[1:02:42] going to happen I'm going to praise God
[1:02:44] anyhow because I done found the power of
[1:02:46] prayer I done found the power of praise
[1:02:49] I done understand that when I begin to
[1:02:51] praise God devil start getting out of
[1:02:53] the way when I start praising God
[1:02:56] atmospheres begin to change when I begin
[1:02:58] to praise God angels gather around me
[1:03:02] and the son of man comes in the middle
[1:03:04] of the
[1:03:07] building somebody say well you don't
[1:03:09] have to act like that well you know the
[1:03:11] Bible tells us a story about when they
[1:03:12] invited Jesus y'all remember that when
[1:03:16] they invited Jesus and they put a bad
[1:03:17] name on him and they put a bad name on
[1:03:20] those holy
[1:03:21] rollers and they made it Pentecostal in
[1:03:24] a bad way amen Pentecost is not bad amen
[1:03:27] when it's an experience it's just when
[1:03:29] it's a
[1:03:31] denomination is that right amen and what
[1:03:34] we found out is is they almost had it
[1:03:37] blocked out what I'm talking about is
[1:03:40] sometimes people don't like praise so
[1:03:43] they'll set on the they'll set on it now
[1:03:45] they they got Myriad of reasons of why
[1:03:47] but they set on the move of the spirit
[1:03:49] and every time it starts coming up amen
[1:03:51] they feel like they need to just pull it
[1:03:53] down I almost call them praise police
[1:03:55] you know amen they're going to arrest
[1:03:57] anybody that Praises God any anything
[1:03:59] that moves they're going to they going
[1:04:01] to turn and look at it and they're going
[1:04:02] to try to quieten it down now now listen
[1:04:05] what I'm saying to you is they almost
[1:04:07] had that completely amen they almost had
[1:04:10] Jesus completely boxed
[1:04:12] out but there was this one little woman
[1:04:15] that when she come walking by amen she
[1:04:18] took an oil and the Bible said she took
[1:04:20] a bottle of oil and went into the feet
[1:04:23] of Jesus and she broke the top off of
[1:04:25] for that you know what that means Amen
[1:04:28] brother Mike she broke the top off you
[1:04:29] know why she broke it off cuz she's
[1:04:31] going to pour it all out she's not going
[1:04:33] to save some for next week or next day
[1:04:37] listen you don't know the cost of the
[1:04:39] praise that's coming out of the man is
[1:04:41] preaching to you this morning it cost
[1:04:43] something to praise God it cost
[1:04:45] something listen amen you wasn't there
[1:04:48] when he saved me you wasn't there when
[1:04:51] he filled me with the Holy Ghost when he
[1:04:53] gave me a direct leadership of the will
[1:04:55] of God I say this morning if anybody's
[1:04:58] got a right to praise Him we've got a
[1:05:00] right to praise the presence of the
[1:05:03] Living God
[1:05:05] [Applause]
[1:05:09] hallelujah
[1:05:11] hallelujah carrying water to the
[1:05:14] camel now y'all know good and well that
[1:05:17] that took a long
[1:05:19] time I don't remember I did a study on
[1:05:21] one time but it was a lot of
[1:05:24] water and that ain't bad if you got a
[1:05:26] fire
[1:05:29] hydrant but when you draw in
[1:05:31] water it was the most work of a good
[1:05:34] afternoon hundreds and hundreds of
[1:05:36] gallons of water they said 10 camels
[1:05:40] somebody can Google it I don't remember
[1:05:41] how many 100 gallons it took but it took
[1:05:43] aund and something gallons to water one
[1:05:46] camel I don't remember the
[1:05:49] number there a
[1:05:52] lot let's just put it that way
[1:05:56] when she's she's watering these
[1:05:59] camels and the Bible said he just held
[1:06:02] quiet he didn't shout loud
[1:06:05] yet because this is only one of the
[1:06:08] requirements is that she would do this
[1:06:12] the other part of this is that she would
[1:06:13] be a
[1:06:15] Kinfolk so the minute she stopped
[1:06:18] watering he looks at her and
[1:06:20] goes and what house do you belong to
[1:06:26] is't that
[1:06:28] amazing who's your
[1:06:34] dad cuz it
[1:06:37] matters brother Bram said see the Church
[1:06:40] of the Living God is blood relation to
[1:06:42] Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:46] Ghost meaning you can praise him you can
[1:06:49] water the camel but if you ain't got the
[1:06:51] Holy Ghost you still can't be a member
[1:06:54] of that bride but a holy ghost filled
[1:06:57] bride praising his name amen is exactly
[1:07:00] what he's looking
[1:07:03] for who who's your who's what's your
[1:07:05] name what house are you in and when she
[1:07:09] began to
[1:07:10] reveal she came from the house of
[1:07:13] Abraham's
[1:07:15] Kinfolk the Bible said that the servant
[1:07:18] bowed his head and Worship the
[1:07:21] Lord yall know in Lo in Los Angeles
[1:07:24] brother man preaches is a message called
[1:07:26] time of decision which is the subject
[1:07:27] matter I'm preaching now do you know
[1:07:30] what his opening verse for that was and
[1:07:33] the and the servant bowed his head and
[1:07:35] praised the
[1:07:36] Lord because he was coming to that
[1:07:41] choice of the Bride now watch what
[1:07:43] happens when he when he brings this
[1:07:45] bride to this point I mean Rebecca
[1:07:47] Rebecca has heard and and I was reading
[1:07:50] it this morning and when I started
[1:07:52] reading this point it literally just
[1:07:54] felt like Electric my office I mean the
[1:07:56] anointing just swirled because the Bible
[1:07:59] tells us that when when he started
[1:08:02] talking he started telling them about
[1:08:06] Abraham and how since he left his home
[1:08:10] and it says and God has blessed him with
[1:08:13] cattle and with servants and with great
[1:08:16] riches and a son in his own
[1:08:19] age and then he says and he's heir of
[1:08:23] all these
[1:08:24] things in other words Rebecca you're
[1:08:26] about to marry one of the wealthiest men
[1:08:28] there is to
[1:08:30] marry his father is a great wealthy man
[1:08:33] and you're going to marry in the
[1:08:39] money now it's nice if he's goodlooking
[1:08:42] but if he's got
[1:08:46] money now you boys that are going to the
[1:08:48] gym instead of working let me tell you
[1:08:49] she's more interested in six cars than
[1:08:51] six-
[1:08:53] pack just saying
[1:08:58] I told my wife I ain't got no sixpack I
[1:09:00] got
[1:09:05] 24
[1:09:10] Hallelujah I don't know how we got
[1:09:14] here I guess we need to laugh a
[1:09:19] [Laughter]
[1:09:22] little where was I at
[1:09:27] marry him for money that's where we
[1:09:33] were now it's it's odd because they
[1:09:35] wanted them to give them 10 days they
[1:09:37] wanted 10 days and and and Elia wouldn't
[1:09:40] have it he said look if if if you're
[1:09:43] going to take him you're going to marry
[1:09:45] him I've already gave you the message of
[1:09:49] him either you believe it or you
[1:09:53] don't there's a lot more to know about
[1:09:55] about it and we'll tell you on the
[1:09:58] journey but you got to make a choice to
[1:10:01] go you got to make a choice to leave
[1:10:04] your father your mother your
[1:10:05] denominations you got to leave it
[1:10:07] all but I got something for you on the
[1:10:10] journey when you when you mount up on

[1:10:43] I'll go I'll go I'll go meet this
[1:10:47] one somebody said have you got more to

[1:11:09] it the way I see
[1:11:10] it look his name was
[1:11:14] elaser just like they had an Elijah in
[1:11:17] that day there was a little a little
[1:11:19] black woman down in Memphis that was
[1:11:22] having prayer remember and when brother
[1:11:24] Randon comes she he said I had a vision
[1:11:26] or a dream and I said Lord where is my
[1:11:30] Elijah and I saw you coming down the
[1:11:32] road so his name might have been William
[1:11:34] Brandon but he's my
[1:11:36] Elijah his name might have been William
[1:11:39] Brandon but he's my
[1:11:40] elaser I can't be Rebecca if he's not
[1:11:43] elaser oh Hallelujah but he's elaser and
[1:11:48] Isaac amen is Jesus
[1:11:51] Christ but here's the thing she had to
[1:11:53] go on his word that's all she had right
[1:11:56] think about this and he had some
[1:11:59] gifts that's all he had that's what he
[1:12:01] had to offer but you know if you follow
[1:12:04] the message of this the the Vindication
[1:12:06] of this message goes beyond anything
[1:12:08] ever written in the history of the
[1:12:10] world our El eer that came to us could
[1:12:14] stand and tell the to rise up
[1:12:16] and walk and then look at you and say

[1:13:10] exactly right that elra was telling but

[1:15:03] the spirit come on it's the new wine the
[1:15:07] new wine is stimulation caused by
[1:15:10] Revelation and the marriage of Jesus on
[1:15:14] the third day he went to a marriage
[1:15:16] first miracle he ever did and he turned
[1:15:18] water into wine and he brought
[1:15:21] stimulation in the time and they said
[1:15:23] you save the best for the last
[1:15:26] Hallelujah listen listen he turned water
[1:15:29] into wine and fat marriage and at the
[1:15:31] end time he has promised to take the
[1:15:34] water and turn it into wine and make
[1:15:37] stimulation power amen have you ever
[1:15:39] seen anybody take the water out of the
[1:15:41] well of Rebecca and Isaac make it into
[1:15:42] stimulation power for the

[1:15:58] you left your house and you met up there
[1:16:01] in the middle right what is it amen it's
[1:16:03] the meeting it's the meeting in the air
[1:16:07] all you got is this message that's all
[1:16:09] you've got that's all you've got he
[1:16:11] found her in evening light the same as
[1:16:13] you have been found in evening
[1:16:15] light elasia was looking for character
[1:16:19] character that would receive the end
[1:16:21] time message and so have we received the
[1:16:24] the end time message listen when we look
[1:16:27] at this I say this that the prophet of
[1:16:29] God of this age had a job and it was to
[1:16:32] get a bride for
[1:16:34] Isaac the the marriage that we are
[1:16:37] talking about is a union between you and
[1:16:39] the
[1:16:41] word we're not talking about the
[1:16:43] Corporal body of the Lord this morning
[1:16:45] we're talking about the word that has
[1:16:46] been promised to come in this age the
[1:16:49] prophet of God said it like this and the
[1:16:51] word as the bridegroom being the word
[1:16:53] the bride being the hearer of the word
[1:16:55] they come together in a union and they
[1:16:58] unite like a
[1:17:00] wedding you're the hearer he's the word
[1:17:04] when you receive the word there's a
[1:17:06] wedding going on in there there is a
[1:17:09] union brother Bram called it an
[1:17:11] invisible Union but a prophet could see
[1:17:15] in the
[1:17:16] invisible and he would announce to the
[1:17:19] church you're no longer two you're now
[1:17:22] one looking in the Supernatural he was
[1:17:25] looking at you and he was saying Brother
[1:17:28] David what a powerful thing he was
[1:17:29] looking at you and he was saying you're
[1:17:32] one he wasn't looking there's Jesus and
[1:17:34] there's you there's Christ there's you
[1:17:36] he was saying they are now
[1:17:39] one Christ is in the bride by the word
[1:17:43] of God made manifest within her amen do
[1:17:46] you see the prophet of God in the in the
[1:17:48] message proven his word for you that are
[1:17:50] a great studiers I I know I'll just
[1:17:51] bring this one to you so you can Mite it
[1:17:53] down and take it home with you amen man
[1:17:55] improving his word brother BR said
[1:17:56] there's got to come something to unite
[1:17:57] the two together the church has to be
[1:18:00] the word and if he unites the two
[1:18:02] together it'll take the manifestation of
[1:18:04] the revealing of the son of man not a
[1:18:06] clergy do you see what I mean is the son
[1:18:08] of man Jesus Christ will come down in
[1:18:10] human flesh and will make his word so
[1:18:12] real that it will unite the church in
[1:18:14] him as the bride and then she'll go home
[1:18:17] to the wedding supper she's already
[1:18:21] united we go to the marriage supper not
[1:18:24] the
[1:18:25] marriage all these fleshly Mighty Men
[1:18:28] the marriage of the Lamb has come see
[1:18:30] the Rapture is going to be the wedding
[1:18:32] supper the word here unites with a
[1:18:35] person and they Two Become One and what
[1:18:38] does it do then it manifests the son of
[1:18:40] man again what is happening the marriage
[1:18:43] has already
[1:18:46] happened the marriage has taking place
[1:18:48] now now I I let me just say it to you
[1:18:50] like that there's many members of his
[1:18:53] bride right
[1:18:55] amen there's many members of his bride
[1:18:57] and there's marriages taking place
[1:18:59] constantly with this word but there's
[1:19:02] going to be one
[1:19:03] supper for the whole body of the Bride
[1:19:07] of Jesus Christ what is it we are living
[1:19:09] in the age I'll read it to you now he
[1:19:12] shall appear in these last days to bring
[1:19:14] the people back to the word so the bride
[1:19:17] will know her
[1:19:19] husband her mate the revealed word isn't
[1:19:25] that powerful the revealed word is your
[1:19:28] mate that's why the prophet in turn on
[1:19:30] the light would look at the church and
[1:19:32] say it's bride
[1:19:35] time it's why he would look and say it's
[1:19:38] seed time it's bride time what's he
[1:19:41] talking about amen the word the revealed
[1:19:44] word has come and there has been a
[1:19:47] marrying that's taking place can I can I
[1:19:50] deliberate on something to you we okay
[1:19:53] y'all I want to deliberate on something
[1:19:56] to you and I want you to see something
[1:19:57] very clearly this is not you marrying
[1:20:01] Jesus this is Jesus marrying
[1:20:07] you this is not you marrying him this is
[1:20:11] him marrying you I show it to you in the
[1:20:15] scripture you're a gentile Ruth the mois
[1:20:18] was a gentile right and her Israelites
[1:20:23] had moved down in to Moab and when they
[1:20:26] got ready to return they returned home
[1:20:28] in the time of of great Peril and great
[1:20:31] death just like we had in the 1940s when
[1:20:34] all the Jews were killed and they
[1:20:35] returned to a Jewish State same thing in
[1:20:38] the Book of Ruth happened right here in
[1:20:41] the
[1:20:41] 1940s and when they returned while they
[1:20:45] were returning into their
[1:20:47] Homeland Jesus is going to get ready to
[1:20:50] redeem them as His People amen but
[1:20:53] there's a gentile bride that returns at
[1:20:56] the same time as Israel returns so is
[1:20:59] the bride that's why the angel coming to
[1:21:02] brother brandom at the same time that
[1:21:04] Israel becomes a nation is so relevant
[1:21:06] to us because it's just like amen Boaz
[1:21:11] amen at the field of harvest that
[1:21:14] whenever Naomi returns she returns with
[1:21:16] Ruth is that right and they were Kinsmen
[1:21:19] they were near Kinsman brother Ben I
[1:21:21] thought I'd just come out the back room
[1:21:22] and shout when you started your song
[1:21:24] this morning
[1:21:25] I was like Hallelujah that guy's scary
[1:21:31] man Heen and and watch it's the greatest
[1:21:34] love story right there's not a greater
[1:21:36] love story than the Bible and the story
[1:21:39] of Ruth and Boaz and Naomi is speaking
[1:21:41] of Gentile bride the Jewish old old the
[1:21:45] old of the Old Testament the Jewish
[1:21:47] woman and is speaking of Jesus as Boaz
[1:21:49] the kinsman redeemer of the church and
[1:21:52] when they return they're poor and
[1:21:54] they've lost all their inheritance and
[1:21:56] Ruth goes to work in his field and he
[1:21:59] notices this girl and he ask who is this
[1:22:03] girl and they said well and me let's
[1:22:05] just get down to the short of it well
[1:22:06] she's your kin folk and she come back
[1:22:08] from Moab and she's working in your
[1:22:09] field he says to his guys he said look
[1:22:12] boys he said while she's working y'all
[1:22:14] just leave little handfuls along the way
[1:22:17] y'all just drop little bells along the
[1:22:19] way amen you know what brother B said it
[1:22:21] was a type of he said it was a type of
[1:22:23] this bride he said he told the angels of
[1:22:25] God while this bride's in the field drop
[1:22:28] little handfuls of purpose in her way
[1:22:30] that she'll find purpose along the way
[1:22:33] amen and and and the Bible tells us that
[1:22:35] she only worked in the field of Boaz
[1:22:38] which is a type of the church staying in
[1:22:40] the word amen and it's in the word is
[1:22:43] where our Redemption is and it's in the
[1:22:45] word where God is going to give life and
[1:22:48] you're going to find your your mate is
[1:22:50] which is Christ but it's not until
[1:22:52] toward the end of the book of of Ruth
[1:22:54] and moaz that this book of redemption
[1:22:55] becomes so beautiful it's whenever Ruth
[1:22:58] decides amen that that Naomi says look
[1:23:01] we're we're near Kinsman aen this man
[1:23:04] can redeem us if you just go to him
[1:23:07] isn't it beautiful when she goes to him
[1:23:10] it's in the
[1:23:12] evening and it's also in the time of
[1:23:14] harvest which type of us it's in the
[1:23:17] evening it's a type of the Harvest and
[1:23:20] she goes into the threshing floor where
[1:23:22] the seeds are being separated from the
[1:23:25] Shook and at that time she goes in and
[1:23:28] lays at the feet of the only one who can
[1:23:30] redeem her she humbles herself to this
[1:23:34] message and lays at the feet and when he
[1:23:36] rises up y'all know the story when he
[1:23:39] rises up and sees who she is amen he
[1:23:41] actually ask her who are
[1:23:44] you she re she reveals who she
[1:23:47] is and when he finds out she's his
[1:23:50] Kinsman through Naomi she says will you
[1:23:53] redeem me
[1:23:55] and he said I will redeem you oh when
[1:23:58] she returns
[1:24:00] home she walks into the house with Naomi
[1:24:02] the Old Testament scripture she walks in
[1:24:05] the house with Naomi and Naomi turns
[1:24:06] back to
[1:24:08] her and she said who are
[1:24:11] you because she was returning from the
[1:24:13] field different than she left she was a
[1:24:18] girl with a
[1:24:19] promise a promise from a wealthy man
[1:24:23] because he was able to do all that he
[1:24:26] said he could
[1:24:28] do very
[1:24:31] quickly you know what she told you know
[1:24:33] what Naomi told Ruth she said Ruth
[1:24:35] listen
[1:24:39] rest yes sir rest and she tells her
[1:24:42] where she can find her rest she said
[1:24:44] because this man won't stop until the
[1:24:47] thing is
[1:24:49] finished it moved from roof's
[1:24:52] work to the work a
[1:24:55] Boaz she couldn't do this
[1:24:58] part she couldn't open the seals she
[1:25:02] couldn't bring the word all she had to
[1:25:05] do was wait till the Boaz was able to
[1:25:08] unveil this thing to her oh I'll tell
[1:25:10] you this amen Boaz went down to the city
[1:25:13] the next day amen actually found a a
[1:25:15] closer kin which was the devil right and
[1:25:17] he said to her said to the C will you
[1:25:19] redeem her he said no I won't redeem her
[1:25:21] he said well I will so he goes down and
[1:25:23] gathers all the elders and I wished I
[1:25:25] had more time to preach on it but I'm
[1:25:26] going to just give you the story but he
[1:25:28] goes down and gathers all the elders and
[1:25:29] brings them around which is the
[1:25:31] tradition and he has to prove to them
[1:25:33] his intention with this woman and he has
[1:25:35] to prove that he's Kinsman of Naomi and
[1:25:38] he has to prove that he's worthy that he
[1:25:40] has enough money to do the buying he has
[1:25:42] the kinsmanship to do it and that he's
[1:25:44] willing to do it because her other
[1:25:46] Kinsman wasn't willing to do it because
[1:25:48] she wasn't worthy to him and when he
[1:25:50] started testifying to those Elders he
[1:25:52] started telling the whole story and he
[1:25:54] started telling look I'm the Kinsman and
[1:25:56] I've got this much money and I've got
[1:25:58] this and I've got this and I want to
[1:26:00] redeem
[1:26:01] Naomi and the Bible tells us whenever he
[1:26:04] gave it out they said worthy you're
[1:26:06] worthy to do it and the Bible tells us
[1:26:08] that he redeemed Naomi he redeemed the
[1:26:11] fields amen he redeemed and he got Ruth
[1:26:15] in the
[1:26:16] deal Ruth was the whole reason for the
[1:26:19] deal right Ruth was everything that he
[1:26:23] was looking for that was the reason of
[1:26:26] his doing do you know when brother Bram
[1:26:28] preaches this in Revelations 5 and also
[1:26:30] the breach that he brings this story
[1:26:32] every time to describe to the church
[1:26:35] what the lamb had to do to redeem the
[1:26:37] church right and he said when they were
[1:26:39] up in heaven sister Hannah it's a
[1:26:41] powerful story he said there was one sit
[1:26:43] upon the throne and he had a book in his
[1:26:46] hand and that book was sealed in
[1:26:48] Revelations 5 and when John looked upon
[1:26:51] this the Bible said nobody was Worthy to
[1:26:54] redeem there was no Kinsman in heaven to
[1:26:57] redeem and John said he turned and he
[1:27:00] said oh there's a line the tribe of
[1:27:02] Judah had prevailed to take the book and
[1:27:04] he turned to see a Lon and he saw the
[1:27:07] lamb and he saw that Jesus that lamb the
[1:27:11] symbology had become a lion he had
[1:27:14] become a king he had become the worthy
[1:27:17] one he' become somebody that could pay
[1:27:20] the price he could answer the questions
[1:27:22] he could beat back the en enemies he
[1:27:24] could redeem everything that had been
[1:27:26] lost look at the power of this I I don't
[1:27:28] know if you've ever compared Boaz but
[1:27:31] look back there when he set before the
[1:27:32] elders and here Jesus is in heaven when
[1:27:35] they said there's 24 elders and there's
[1:27:37] 12 of the Patriarchs and there's 12 new
[1:27:39] types apostles who all knew the law who
[1:27:42] all knew kinsmanship who all knew what
[1:27:44] it would take to redeem and the prophet
[1:27:47] of God said his act of
[1:27:49] redemption was to stand before the
[1:27:51] elders and testify
[1:27:54] that they are my kin folks can you
[1:27:57] imagine Jesus standing before the elders
[1:28:01] before the Patriarchs and taken the
[1:28:03] Lamb's Book which had your name Jaden
[1:28:05] which had your name Noah and he stood
[1:28:08] before all the elders and all the angels
[1:28:10] and said them are my
[1:28:12] children and he claimed you with all
[1:28:14] your problems with all your life with
[1:28:16] all your situations and he claimed every
[1:28:19] bit of it and said they belong to me and
[1:28:22] I am worthy with my own blood I paid the
[1:28:26] price of redemption for them and he took
[1:28:28] them and the Bible said while he was
[1:28:31] giving his testimony the elders begin to
[1:28:34] throw down their crowns and say Worthy
[1:28:37] is the Lamb Worthy is the Lamb let me
[1:28:41] say something to you this morning he is
[1:28:43] worthy he is worthy he's paid the price
[1:28:46] and my redeemer is also my husband his
[1:28:49] name is Jesus Christ and he claimed me
[1:28:52] when I was in the depths of sin and told
[1:28:55] Satan take your hands off of this one it
[1:28:58] belongs to
[1:29:01] me and when he gets ready to take this
[1:29:03] bride home let me tell you this there'll
[1:29:05] not be one sin against her when he gets
[1:29:08] ready for this bride to walk into heaven
[1:29:10] amen into his father's house there will
[1:29:12] not be one accusation there will not be
[1:29:15] one sin there will not be one recorded
[1:29:17] problem because the blood of Jesus
[1:29:20] Christ is Worthy
[1:29:24] I think somebody ought to say hallelujah
[1:29:26] he's worthy this morning the blood of
[1:29:29] the Lamb is
[1:29:33] worthy preacher what are you trying to
[1:29:35] get at I I I I I'll make it short in
[1:29:37] closing I'll say this to you what I'm
[1:29:39] trying to say is there's been a
[1:29:43] marriage and with every marriage there's
[1:29:45] a marriage certificate you say what is
[1:29:47] your marriage certificate the prophet of
[1:29:49] God said it was my name on the Lamb's
[1:29:51] Book of Life from before the foundation
[1:29:53] of of the
[1:29:55] world every marriage has a wedding ring
[1:29:58] you say where's your wedding ring
[1:29:59] brother Bram said our wedding ring is
[1:30:01] the pre is the unmerited grace of
[1:30:04] almighty God we're wearing the ring of
[1:30:06] Grace and our contract is our name is on
[1:30:09] the Lamb's Book of Life and the Lamb's
[1:30:12] blood was shame for you and I before we
[1:30:14] ever sinned the first
[1:30:18] time I'm not a great student of the
[1:30:20] Jewish uh laws and arts but I did notice
[1:30:23] that most Jewish weddings take place on
[1:30:25] the third
[1:30:27] day because it was third day there's a
[1:30:29] double good right because it was first
[1:30:31] time life came in the earth in Genesis 1
[1:30:34] and it was good it was good double good
[1:30:37] the Third Day Jewish weddings are are
[1:30:39] around that but Jewish weddings are
[1:30:42] different because they take a little
[1:30:45] time they they have a a little season
[1:30:48] they're a little
[1:30:50] different there's actually in a Jewish
[1:30:53] wedding
[1:30:54] which is what Paul's basing here there's
[1:30:58] actually a point in the
[1:31:00] wedding I wish I knew Hebrew I'd tell
[1:31:02] you the word but there's a word there
[1:31:04] for marriage
[1:31:06] contract and when a woman's getting
[1:31:08] married to a man in Jewish they actually
[1:31:11] write a
[1:31:12] contract that says that he will
[1:31:14] financially support
[1:31:16] her that he will give her seed for
[1:31:19] children that he will not live leave her
[1:31:22] over so many days
[1:31:25] that she he will he will abide with her
[1:31:27] that if he leaves he has to come back
[1:31:30] she has it a marriage contract which is
[1:31:33] her
[1:31:35] guarantee they say it's not for the male
[1:31:39] it's actually written for the
[1:31:42] woman and when they had this contract
[1:31:44] what SEALs the deal in the Jewish in the
[1:31:47] Jewish wedding what is the point between
[1:31:50] betrothal and wife the point between the
[1:31:53] two
[1:31:54] is when he reads off the
[1:31:57] contract and she willingly accepts
[1:32:01] it
[1:32:05] church when this message
[1:32:08] came and a prophet begin to unveil those
[1:32:11] word when the seals and the Mysteries
[1:32:13] begin to be laid out before
[1:32:16] you the point between
[1:32:19] church and bride
[1:32:24] is when you willingly accepted
[1:32:29] that see modern
[1:32:33] events I know what the devil keeps
[1:32:35] saying he's going to steal you he's
[1:32:36] going to take you we're already
[1:32:45] married all
[1:32:51] ready our musicians come
[1:32:54] they take the marriage contract and it
[1:32:56] literally is written in their
[1:32:58] law that it has to be where they both
[1:33:01] can located at any time so most of the
[1:33:05] time they hang it in the house hang it
[1:33:08] visible so maybe he's been gone a couple
[1:33:11] days on a
[1:33:12] trip and somebody says he ain't coming
[1:33:14] back for
[1:33:15] you all she's got to do is look over and
[1:33:19] there's this
[1:33:21] promise I go away to prepare place but
[1:33:24] I'll come again to receive you under my
[1:33:27] side he made a
[1:33:30] promise he going to leave us
[1:33:35] here wouldn't it be odd wouldn't it be
[1:33:37] odd to start talking to somebody that's
[1:33:40] married like that they're going to get
[1:33:43] married I mean
[1:33:47] yesterday 28 years to my lovely bride we
[1:33:51] 28 years
[1:34:01] well wouldn't it be odd if I got up
[1:34:05] every morning to reassure that we was
[1:34:07] married
[1:34:08] and that would be a very uncomfortable
[1:34:15] life but anybody's been married very
[1:34:17] alone knows that after a little while
[1:34:20] you hit a
[1:34:21] stride where you understand her she
[1:34:25] understands you and you just start
[1:34:27] moving as
[1:34:30] one and it's not you dominating it's not
[1:34:33] her
[1:34:34] rebelling it's just moving as
[1:34:37] one because your will becomes the same
[1:34:41] will it ain't long if you if if you've
[1:34:43] been married very long you know I'm
[1:34:44] telling you the
[1:34:45] truth it comes about the
[1:34:51] grandkids you know it's true
[1:34:55] and you and your Wheels start meeting
[1:34:58] together and they just it just becomes a
[1:35:00] fluid
[1:35:03] easy Rhythm that you're carrying in your
[1:35:09] marriage and at this point of the bride
[1:35:11] of Christ this is not about him making
[1:35:14] you
[1:35:16] submit that's why here that true word we
[1:35:20] don't get up every Sunday with a tu
[1:35:21] before
[1:35:26] we don't and some people say well you're
[1:35:28] not preaching enough clothes line
[1:35:31] well look the marriage has taken
[1:35:35] place and if you want somebody if you
[1:35:38] want to see a changeing them just let
[1:35:40] them get a little
[1:35:42] closer let them get a little
[1:35:45] closer and if they just keep the will
[1:35:47] after a while the will of God will begin
[1:35:50] to overcome them
[1:35:54] something brother bam told me I
[1:35:56] love I take it
[1:35:59] personal he said you never saw angels in
[1:36:02] the spring of the
[1:36:04] Year climbing up the trees and taking
[1:36:06] out the old
[1:36:08] leaves he said you never saw that he
[1:36:11] said because God designed
[1:36:13] it that as soon as new life
[1:36:16] comes it'll start pushing off the old
[1:36:20] Leaf so all you need to do is fall in
[1:36:22] love with Jesus
[1:36:24] amen just fall in love with him he's
[1:36:26] already your husband when you accepted
[1:36:29] that just fall in love and let that
[1:36:31] Spirit just get closer and closer and
[1:36:33] closer and let it move it away from you
