[5:49] and amen do you love the Lord this
[5:51] morning amen isn't it good amen so this
[5:54] morning if we could let's turn in to our
[5:56] Bibles in the book of
[5:58] Ephesians um I want to to speak to you
[6:00] today uh from this Ephesians series
[6:03] again um I I I'm doing it a little bit
[6:06] different as you've already noticed um I
[6:08] am going through but some of these uh
[6:11] scriptures uh of course desire deserve a
[6:14] lot more time than I'm spending on them
[6:17] uh but like a some of these sections uh
[6:21] Paul is saying something that we've
[6:23] we've preached it real thoroughly as far
[6:25] as like the the Gentiles coming into the
[6:28] body and then the build to the
[6:29] habitation so I'm covering four and five
[6:32] six scriptures at the same time but
[6:34] rather than just systematically teaching
[6:36] I'm talking about the subject around it
[6:38] uh so uh if we want to this morning
[6:41] we're going to read Ephesians 3: 14 down
[6:44] to
[6:45] 21 and this will be uh this will be a
[6:48] prayer here that Paul has made and uh I
[6:52] I think it's very
[6:53] powerful Ephesians 3:14 Paul Begins by
[6:57] saying for this cause I bow my knes unto
[7:00] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of
[7:03] whom the whole family in Heaven and
[7:05] Earth is named so the father's name is
[7:09] Jesus Jesus said I come in my father's
[7:11] name and his name was Jesus and the
[7:14] whole family's name is Jesus so Father
[7:18] Son and Holy Ghost Jesus amen that would
[7:22] Grant according to the riches of his
[7:24] glory to be strengthened with might by
[7:28] his spirit in the the inner man yeah
[7:31] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[7:34] faith that you be rooted and grounded in
[7:38] love and brother Rays on this love
[7:40] Series so I'm going to skip this little
[7:41] area here and I'm going to read it to
[7:43] you but you but you he's preaching it
[7:45] and you may be able to comprehend with
[7:47] All Saints what is the breadth and the
[7:51] length and the depth and the height he
[7:54] he's going to measure it out I thought
[7:56] that was pretty powerful he got her he
[7:58] got her measured out and to know the
[8:00] love of Christ which passees
[8:03] knowledge so he's talking about the
[8:05] measurement and now he says that it's
[8:07] going to pass your
[8:08] knowledge amen and then he says now unto
[8:13] him that is able somebody say He's Able
[8:18] unto him that is able to do
[8:22] exceedingly and
[8:24] abundantly above all that we could ask
[8:27] or think according to the power that
[8:31] worketh in
[8:32] us I I like that and unto him be glory
[8:36] in the church by Jesus Christ by Christ
[8:39] Jesus throughout all the ages the World
[8:42] Without End let's bow our hearts
[8:44] almighty God we thank you this morning
[8:46] as your children we've come to the house
[8:48] of the Lord to serve you and to Worship
[8:51] You Lord and we certainly want the devil
[8:54] to know what side we're on we want to
[8:56] make our our hearts known Lord before
[8:59] before you and before this world that
[9:01] Lord we love you and we want to serve
[9:03] you and we desire this morning that you
[9:06] would come and take your word and bless
[9:08] this congregation and them that have
[9:10] gathered together now we ask it father
[9:12] in Jesus name amen and amen and God
[9:16] bless you as you be seated today I want
[9:19] to speak to you here from this 20th
[9:21] verse it'll be the uh the uh context of
[9:24] my thought today I want to title it if I
[9:27] could a Divine ability a Divine ability
[9:31] uh I I just was reading over this and I
[9:34] thought it was amazing that Paul was
[9:35] talking about depths and Heights and
[9:37] breaths and then he says but unto him
[9:39] that is able to do it exceedingly so
[9:42] after you get it all figured out Paul
[9:44] said there's somebody that can do more
[9:45] than you could think or that you could
[9:48] ask or that you could imagine or that
[9:50] you could dream amen unto him that can
[9:54] exceed he's able to exceed whatever you
[9:57] think he exceeds that what what a and
[10:00] not just he does it but he does it
[10:02] abundantly amen above all now it's
[10:05] because of his potential because God is
[10:08] able amen I I think it's a very powerful
[10:11] thing when you look at what uh the
[10:14] reason all these things can happen is
[10:16] because that God is able amen meaning
[10:19] having the power or having the skill he
[10:23] has the means he has the opportunity to
[10:25] do something he's able amen God is is
[10:29] able I I I think of this because it
[10:32] speaks of ability or it speaks of
[10:35] potential it means he can do
[10:38] it amen because he's able that's right
[10:41] he can do it because he's able now I I
[10:44] I'm thinking of this today amen sitting
[10:47] here and hearing these testimonies and
[10:49] looking across this congregation and
[10:51] amen and brother brother Andy I'm so
[10:53] glad to see him in service today knowing
[10:56] knowing that he's a testimony you know
[10:58] God is able amen God is able to do these
[11:02] things now according to Paul in Hebrews
[11:05] 13 which brother Bram loved this
[11:06] scripture was one of the main themes of
[11:08] his scripture that Jesus Christ is the
[11:11] same yesterday today and forever amen in
[11:15] other words whatever he was he still is
[11:19] and whatever he did he still does
[11:22] because he's the same he is an
[11:24] unchanging God with unchanging nature
[11:27] and with unchanging ways amen according
[11:30] to Malachi 3 and: 6 he prophesies and
[11:33] said for I am the Lord and I change not
[11:37] therefore you're the sons of Jacob are
[11:38] not consumed so God says I am God and I
[11:41] change not so not only is it that Paul
[11:44] would say it now he said it and brother
[11:46] bam says it like this he says and what
[11:49] good is a historical Christ if he isn't
[11:52] the same
[11:53] today what good is us to teach the Bible
[11:56] to our children or to talk about the God
[11:59] that was with our fathers or The God
[12:01] that was in Pentecost or The God that
[12:03] was with Martin Luther or The God was
[12:04] with brother brandham what good would it
[12:06] do to talk about this kind of God if he
[12:09] wasn't exactly the same kind of God this
[12:12] morning amen and the prophet of God says
[12:15] see he says but what good does it do to
[12:18] take a canary bird and feeding fine
[12:20] vitamins he said and have pretty
[12:22] feathers and have strong wings and then
[12:25] keep him in a
[12:26] cage he says it doesn't do him any good
[12:29] good and we talk about how great God was
[12:31] he said then don't say he's the same
[12:33] yesterday today and forever something's
[12:35] wrong we've caged up somewhere and
[12:37] that's a false conception of what God is
[12:40] the Bible says he's the same and he's
[12:42] the same he hasn't changed one bit he's
[12:45] the same yesterday today and forever and
[12:48] now we have today in this day and time
[12:51] like they did in his day we have our own
[12:53] thought of it but surely if there's any
[12:55] way in the world that we would truly
[12:57] know we will have to find out what he
[12:59] was and then we can find out what he was
[13:02] in other ages so the prophet is saying
[13:04] that the reason that we find out what
[13:06] God was in another age is to find out
[13:09] what he could do in our age amen the
[13:11] reason that we would look into the power
[13:13] of God and the reality of God is only to
[13:16] discover what is available to us this
[13:19] morning because we serve the same God
[13:22] and he has not changed and remember the
[13:23] Bible said he's the same yesterday today
[13:26] and forever so we'll have to find out
[13:27] what he was into other ages he when he
[13:30] walked on the earth and how the age
[13:32] after he was on the earth and he left
[13:34] the Earth we found out what he was and
[13:36] he'll be the same thing today I believe
[13:39] that God is the same and I believe you
[13:41] can do the same things this morning that
[13:43] he ever did now according to the Bible
[13:47] amen the question is not on God but the
[13:50] question is on
[13:51] us it was a man one time that had a
[13:54] child that the pH uh that the uh
[13:56] disciples themselves were praying for
[13:59] and and he wasn't able to deliver him
[14:01] and the scripture says that the man
[14:03] brought the child unto Jesus amen and
[14:06] when he brought him he says this child
[14:09] amen was foaming on the ground and Jesus
[14:11] said now how long has it been this way
[14:14] of of a child and and he says well this
[14:17] child he cast himself into the fire and
[14:19] into the waters to destroy him he says
[14:22] but if thou can do anything have
[14:25] compassion on us and help us and Jesus
[14:28] said unto him if thou can't believe all
[14:31] things are possible amen unto him that
[14:34] believeth now there's the question this
[14:37] morning it's not on whether God can amen
[14:40] because the scripture says God is able
[14:43] amen but it's not is God able to do it
[14:46] it's are we able to believe he can do it
[14:48] amen I think this morning what a
[14:50] powerful thing that God took care of all
[14:53] of the things that we need for our
[14:55] healing and for our salvation and then
[14:58] turn to us and said if we were able to
[15:00] believe amen that all things are
[15:03] possible to them that do believe amen
[15:05] now that's a that's a lot when you say
[15:07] all things amen all things are possible
[15:10] to them that believe amen I think this
[15:13] morning the prophet says it like this he
[15:15] says now here it is healing is already
[15:17] yours the only thing that is he said
[15:20] maybe sin maybe sometime something
[15:23] you're doing in your life or something
[15:25] is not right or some Demon is holding
[15:28] over you that won't let you believe he
[15:31] said now you know but if it isn't Jesus
[15:35] told you something wrong all things are
[15:38] possible to them that believe is that
[15:40] right there it lays within you and not
[15:45] God my goodness amen that what we need
[15:48] this morning doesn't lay in God it lays
[15:51] in US amen if we can only believe all
[15:55] things are possible to them that believe
[15:58] amen the Propet of God says it like this
[16:00] we've got to break through the barrier
[16:02] now you know what he's talking about
[16:04] he's talking about the sound barrier in
[16:05] times past where man was not able to
[16:08] break through the barrier of sound amen
[16:11] just like you remember the the runners
[16:13] when they wanted to run and used to be
[16:15] that couldn't nobody run a 4minute mile
[16:17] now it's more than standard that people
[16:19] run 4minute miles used to be amen that
[16:23] people thought you couldn't fly now we
[16:25] can fly there was a barrier but it's
[16:26] gone and when they could fly then they
[16:28] they said well you can't fly past the
[16:30] sound barrier but then jger proved you
[16:33] can get past the sound barrier amen and
[16:35] whatever fear they had breaking that
[16:37] barrier that man did it and proved you
[16:40] not only can do it but it gets smoother
[16:43] on the other side amen and sometimes
[16:45] when we come up to barriers amen and the
[16:48] enemy is saying to us this is impossible
[16:51] this part can't happen amen you've been
[16:53] too far too long there's been too much
[16:56] trouble it's been here too many years
[16:58] it'll never take place amen but I say
[17:01] this morning you are to press through
[17:03] the barrier of unbelief and say God is
[17:06] able this morning and let me say this if
[17:08] you ever break through the barrier
[17:10] things get smoother on the other side
[17:12] amen I tell you this morning the prophet
[17:15] of God said we've got to break through
[17:16] that power of unbelief and then Miracles
[17:19] and things now watch what he's saying
[17:22] the only thing between us and a miracle
[17:24] is the power of
[17:26] unbelief then he said then like this you
[17:29] break through that power of unbelief
[17:31] Miracles and things and Promises of God
[17:33] become
[17:35] unlimited my goodness when you break
[17:37] through that barrier of unbelief
[17:40] Miracles become Unlimited in other words
[17:43] amen there's no limit on what God can do
[17:46] when a man gets past the barrier of his
[17:49] own mind of his own experience of his
[17:51] own intellectual failures of his own
[17:53] sinful thoughts of his own troubles in
[17:56] his life all things are possible
[17:59] with God when we begin to
[18:03] believe amen I know I know somebody says
[18:06] I I know I'm already been through it
[18:08] myself while I was studying this but
[18:10] what about this situation what about
[18:12] that situation amen I'll tell you what
[18:14] I'm going to do this morning I'm going
[18:15] to focus out every situation you know
[18:18] I'm going to focus out any reason to
[18:20] disbelieve this word and we're going to
[18:22] come directly to the channel of faith
[18:25] and say by God's grace I believe this
[18:27] amen it doesn't matter matter what my
[18:29] eyes see it doesn't matter what my
[18:31] thoughts are it doesn't what my flesh
[18:33] believes it has nothing to do with it
[18:36] our sin debt was paid for that day on
[18:39] Calvary we have a reason this morning to
[18:41] believe that God can do these things
[18:44] even with the weakness of our ability
[18:47] God is still able amen it doesn't matter
[18:50] who it is that does it if God does it
[18:53] he's still able to do
[18:54] it amen in The Book of Mark ma Matthew
[18:58] you'll find amen even when Jesus is
[19:01] discussing to the Rich Young Ruler amen
[19:03] and he says to him Lord I'd like to
[19:05] inherit eternal life and he said go sell
[19:08] all you have and come follow me and the
[19:11] young man was saddened in his heart now
[19:13] now here's something that's powerful
[19:15] because the Bible said Jesus looked at
[19:17] him and loved him amen so God did love
[19:20] him amen God so loved everybody amen and
[19:23] he loved him but he asked him he said he
[19:26] said listen what you have to do is sell
[19:28] all your you have and come follow me and
[19:30] the boy couldn't do it because he wasn't
[19:32] ready to follow Vindicated word into
[19:35] leadership that's right amen he was
[19:37] still under the Pharisee laws and the
[19:40] ideas amen and and you know uh uh it's
[19:42] amazing because immediately Jesus turns
[19:45] to his disciples and said see it's hard
[19:47] for a rich man to come into heaven and
[19:49] he even describes that he can't get
[19:51] through the eye like taking a camel
[19:53] through the eye of an needle now I've
[19:55] heard people talk about what all that is
[19:57] but whatever Jesus meant by that it's
[19:59] hard for a rich man to get in
[20:01] heaven that's what he said that's what
[20:03] he said and they come back and said amen
[20:06] under the disciples meedi amazed and
[20:09] they said well who can be
[20:11] saved amen if you I think I I would ask
[20:15] him the same thing then Lord who can be
[20:18] saved and then Jesus said see but he
[20:21] beheld them and said with men this is
[20:24] impossible but With God all things are
[20:28] possible and I like that amen amen with
[20:31] man it ain't possible but With God all
[20:34] things are possible amen God in other
[20:37] words not only is it to him that believe
[20:40] there is nothing impossible but to amen
[20:43] With God all things are
[20:46] possible so it's actually possible with
[20:49] God he can save anybody he wants to save
[20:53] amen God can save from the gutter most
[20:56] and put them in the uttermost because
[20:58] he's God he can do the saving and
[21:01] there's nothing impossible with God
[21:04] there's just nothing impossible with God
[21:06] folks God Saves who he wants
[21:08] to he saved me and you didn't know me
[21:11] but let me tell you that took a lot of
[21:13] saving amen and you know some people
[21:15] that you say there's no way amen with
[21:18] man you're right it's impossible with
[21:20] man it'll never happen but with the God
[21:23] I serve there is nothing impossible with
[21:25] that God he could take a drunk off the
[21:28] street and save him he can take the
[21:30] attic out of the cocaine houses and he
[21:32] can save them he can take listen Church
[21:35] we're talking about a god that is able
[21:37] he's able to change the situations he's
[21:40] able to change a man's home he's able to
[21:42] save the situations of Our Lives listen
[21:45] he's the kind of God brother he knows
[21:47] your prayers he knows the situations of
[21:50] your life amen I I I believe this
[21:52] morning amen that there is a God here
[21:55] amen that is has things that are
[21:57] possible and I I love how it says it
[22:00] here in the Book of Luke amen even with
[22:02] with a Mary some people say well brother
[22:04] Wayne I ain't never seen a miracle like
[22:05] that done in my life well does that make
[22:07] it impossible because we've never seen
[22:10] it or never heard of it being with
[22:11] someone now watch this obediently
[22:13] abundantly now we know whatever he done
[22:15] for somebody else he could do for us but
[22:18] what about something you're believing
[22:20] for that you've never seen anybody else
[22:22] get it or you never seen nobody else do
[22:24] it how do you know that you're not the
[22:26] one God's going to use to prove to the
[22:28] world he can do that amen it's just like
[22:31] there was only one leopard healed in the
[22:33] days of of Syria amen when Elijah was
[22:36] there but later the scripture tells us
[22:38] amen there was only one healed and
[22:40] brother BR said that little girl
[22:41] testifying to non didn't didn't even
[22:44] know that God could heal leprosy amen
[22:48] but she had seen him do so many things
[22:49] she believed he could do anything so she
[22:52] said if you just get in the presence of
[22:53] my God and there was only one man healed
[22:56] of leprosy Amen in that day and I say
[22:59] this he will come the example our lord
[23:01] Jesus himself used him in his generation
[23:04] to make an example of so sometimes maybe
[23:07] you're going to be the first person God
[23:08] uses to do
[23:10] something you may become the example
[23:13] God's going to use to say I can do this
[23:15] and there's my example right there hey
[23:17] can you imagine Amen in the Bible that
[23:19] when Isaiah said behold a virgin shall
[23:21] conceive half the people left church
[23:24] that morning thinking they were
[23:25] following a crazy
[23:27] Prophet but the prophet of God said had
[23:29] had Isaiah thought about it he would
[23:32] have never said it he said but being a
[23:35] Vindicated prophet he just said it when
[23:38] it came and I imagine after it got out
[23:40] of his mouth he said dear Lord what have
[23:42] I said a virgin shall conceive and bring
[23:46] forth a child see but it had already
[23:48] been prophesied in Genesis amen that
[23:50] there would be a woman seed Amen in the
[23:53] book of Isaiah it says that God would do
[23:55] a new thing that a woman would Compass a
[23:58] man in other words a virgin would bring
[24:00] a child upon the Earth amen and nobody
[24:02] had ever did it
[24:04] before now we seen we seen it when God
[24:08] went to Zacharias and and Zacharias was
[24:10] questioning the angel of the Lord
[24:12] remember God had to shut up his
[24:14] literally had to make him mute amen he
[24:16] couldn't the man couldn't even talk
[24:18] because of the way he questioned the
[24:20] promise of God until they had the baby
[24:22] he said because God's words would be
[24:24] accomplished and when God speaks
[24:26] something it's going to be accomplished
[24:27] you might as well shut up and wait on it
[24:29] to come and if you can't testify the
[24:31] positive God Amen took away the negative
[24:34] wouldn't even let the man talk until it
[24:36] came into action amen and brother B said
[24:39] and and Zacharias had all those examples
[24:42] he could have looked at Sarah and have
[24:44] what God done for her and could have
[24:45] looked at Hannah and he could have
[24:47] looked at all the examples he said but
[24:49] when God came to Mary that little that
[24:52] little young girl when the angel be to
[24:54] speak to her and said thou going to have
[24:56] a child amen and she said Lord I haven't
[24:59] known a man how's this thing going to be
[25:02] and the angel said to her Thou shalt be
[25:04] overshadowed with the Holy Ghost amen
[25:06] isn't it amazing Amen in Luke 137 it
[25:10] says because with God nothing shall be
[25:14] impossible with God nothing shall be
[25:16] impossible Amen Let me just give you a
[25:18] little breakdown on this the word that
[25:21] is spoken comes with the power to
[25:23] fulfill it so there is no word uttered
[25:25] out of the mouth of God that it doesn't
[25:28] have power within itself to fulfill it
[25:31] when it comes the same as every seed
[25:34] that came into the Earth had power to
[25:36] bring a tree out of a sea when God
[25:38] speaks a word whatever that word is it
[25:41] holds the power to fulfill itself when
[25:44] Isaiah said it he said listen the word
[25:46] of God cannot return unto me void but
[25:49] must accomplish that what I have sent it
[25:51] unto amen I tell you this morning amen
[25:54] there is nothing that is impossible with
[25:57] our God
[25:59] amen now sometimes you just got to take
[26:01] God's word for
[26:03] it and sometimes that's all you got is
[26:07] God's word for it sometimes you don't
[26:09] have any other thing to point at but
[26:12] God's word listen when when when Mary
[26:15] left brother BR said she ran to
[26:17] Elizabeth's house and she was shouting
[26:19] and rejoicing and when Elizabeth saw her
[26:22] she said what is your joy about and
[26:25] brother BR said she said Elizabeth must
[26:27] have said to her did here that we're
[26:28] going to have a child is that what
[26:30] you're so happy about she said yeah
[26:32] Elizabeth I've heard about you I heard
[26:34] about the baby coming I'm so excited for
[26:36] y'all but there's something else that's
[26:38] on my heart this morning I tell you I
[26:41] met an angel up there and he told me I
[26:43] was going to have a child and I was
[26:45] going to call his name Jesus and brother
[26:47] B said the moment the Bible said it when
[26:49] the name Jesus was spoken that the baby
[26:52] John that was in the womb of Elizabeth
[26:55] had never moved for six months and when
[26:58] it heard the name Jesus it begin to LEAP
[27:01] within the womb I tell you the first
[27:03] convert of the name of Jesus was his
[27:05] Forerunner and he done it in the womb
[27:07] amen let me say this morning if it does
[27:10] that to a dead baby in the womb of a
[27:13] woman what would the name of Jesus do
[27:15] Amen in the Church of the Living God who
[27:18] is alive with the baptism of the Holy
[27:21] Ghost I tell you what it ought to do it
[27:23] ought to break out in such a rejoicing
[27:25] in the house of God come on Church we're
[27:28] not a dead Church we're a living church
[27:31] and the name of Jesus is above all names
[27:34] brother Bram said sometimes you got to
[27:36] take that word he says no matter how
[27:39] impossible it looks you begin to believe
[27:43] God Amen now here's the thing Amen
[27:46] brother BR said she didn't wait Mary
[27:49] didn't wait till she was positive she
[27:52] didn't she didn't wait till she seen one
[27:55] physical sign
[27:58] yeah yeah I I'm not crazy this what he
[28:01] talk not one sign he said I he said now
[28:07] I've looked for signs of it he was in a
[28:09] Revival and he said not every seed is
[28:11] even full in the place maybe even 2third
[28:13] full he said but it doesn't matter we
[28:16] don't have to have an overflowing crowd
[28:18] we do have one this morning but amen he
[28:20] said but he says see they only had a 100
[28:23] in the upper room 120 he says now God
[28:26] started a Revival with 120 completely
[28:30] surrendered into his hands and that's
[28:33] never ended a fire that can't be put out
[28:37] what could do it here tonight with
[28:40] hundreds in his hands getting ready
[28:42] believing holding to the promise before
[28:45] him Mary could have waited till she had
[28:47] some kind of sign that she was going to
[28:49] be a mother and you could wait till
[28:52] after these meetings are over you could
[28:54] go home and then maybe then you could
[28:56] move your crippled leg or you could hear
[28:59] a little better out of a deaf ear or
[29:00] that cancer seemed to me not as bad as
[29:03] what was bothering you he said that's
[29:05] not taking God in his word he said take
[29:07] God in his word is to hear the word
[29:10] accept it and start
[29:12] rejoicing to take God in his word is to
[29:14] hear the word accept the word and start
[29:17] rejoicing you said brother Wayne what's
[29:19] going to happen I don't know what's
[29:20] going to happen it ain't my promise it
[29:22] ain't my word it ain't what I said it's
[29:25] what the message of the hour has spoken
[29:27] oh over this generation and let me say
[29:30] this I'll stand with a prophet I'll
[29:32] stand with him I'll say that God's word
[29:34] is true it's yes and amen and there's no
[29:38] backup in this word there's no backup in
[29:40] the faith of God Amen I love how he says
[29:43] it to take his word accept it and start
[29:47] rejoicing he said we could have 500 at
[29:49] the altar tonight which would be a good
[29:51] sign of a Revival is breaking out he
[29:53] said but we don't have to have them amen
[29:55] at the altar he said we have to take
[29:57] God's word for it and start rejoicing
[30:00] something's going to happen the word
[30:02] brings life he says now he's talking
[30:05] about having Revival there in California

[30:08] Revival I don't care if he's anybody in
[30:10] the altar or not we're going to have
[30:11] Revival don't matter how many people's
[30:13] in the seats he's given you how that you
[30:16] have Revival when you can't see Revival
[30:19] he said when Jesus told them to wait in
[30:21] the upper room in the city of Jerusalem
[30:24] until they were doed with power on high
[30:26] that word fell on their ears and they
[30:29] were in that Temple continually praising
[30:32] God he said day and night what were they
[30:36] doing they were watering that promise oh

[31:13] our lives we've got to take the word
[31:15] accept the word and start rejoicing

[40:48] now they had all of them had Faith to
[40:50] come out you know they all had Faith to
[40:52] come out under those great plages but
[40:54] when they got out in the desert amen and
[40:57] and years they go to look over in the
[41:00] land and 12 comes back but 10 of them
[41:02] comes back and says hey man there's
[41:04] Giants over there I know God promised
[41:07] land but there's Giants in that land and
[41:09] there's wall cities in that land and
[41:11] we'll we'll never be able to take that
[41:13] land and I love what the I love that
[41:16] what Caleb pronounces in in numbers 13
[41:19] Caleb stealed the people before Moses
[41:21] and said let us go up at
[41:26] once let us go up at once he says and
[41:29] possess it for we are well able to
[41:32] overcome
[41:34] it for we are well able to overcome it
[41:37] Caleb knew he wasn't able to tear down
[41:40] walls or beat Giants but he knew that
[41:43] was a promise from God that they could
[41:45] possess that land and the God that he
[41:47] was serving had already done these
[41:49] things he' already opened the Red Sea
[41:51] he' already delivered two million people
[41:53] out into a desert listen I I I I know I
[41:57] I just just I got to put this out here
[41:59] to you amen it's it's like brother Seth
[42:01] it's like having a birthday party and
[42:03] inviting the whole church now you can do
[42:05] it but what you going to do with them
[42:07] when you get
[42:09] them you can do it and everybody might
[42:12] come but what you going to do if you got
[42:14] a house my size not everybody can
[42:16] come unless we do it out in the backyard
[42:19] we do that once in a while just have it
[42:20] out in the backyard and everybody can
[42:22] come but what I'm saying to you is how
[42:24] you feed two million after you get them
[42:26] what do you amen how how do you how do
[42:28] you Doctor the kids how do you how do
[42:31] you take care of the of the earaches and
[42:33] the coughs and how do you take listen to
[42:35] me amen you're talking about two million
[42:41] people but he knew God was
[42:44] able he didn't have it all figured out
[42:46] but he knew God was able to do
[42:49] it now that same God that did all of
[42:52] that was now Caleb was professing we are
[42:55] able
[42:57] because what he was doing is he was
[42:59] looking at a promise that God had made
[43:01] now promises transfer
[43:05] ability say that one more time promises
[43:08] transfer
[43:10] ability what you're not able to do God
[43:13] is able to do but he transfers it to you
[43:16] by promise so when God makes a promise
[43:20] you believe the promise you've now taken
[43:22] the power and ability of God and using
[43:25] it for your own ability yes I think it's
[43:27] powerful you said well preacher is that
[43:29] really sure it really is Jesus in Mark
[43:31] 11 he cursed a tree a fig tree he cursed
[43:34] it and when they saw it and marveled at
[43:37] it Jesus said unto them if you have
[43:39] faith in God you could say unto this
[43:42] mountain here be moved and cast into the
[43:45] sea he transferred his spoken word
[43:48] ability to those that heard the promises
[43:52] of God because he was able they became
[43:54] able because he's able you you're able
[43:57] you are able to subdue this morning
[44:00] you're able to come through this morning
[44:02] because he is able you're able it's a
[44:05] promise over your life and Promises
[44:08] transfer ability man when I think about
[44:12] this I think of I think of how sometimes
[44:15] we we look at things and how God looks
[44:17] at them and and I I as as I'm reading
[44:19] Moses sometimes I really get him I
[44:21] really get what he's what he's saying
[44:23] here but do you know that when Caleb and
[44:25] Joshua delivered these powerful speech
[44:27] that were able the congregation all
[44:29] rejoiced and said okay let's go over no
[44:31] it's not what
[44:32] happened do youall know what really
[44:34] happened the congregation picked up
[44:37] stones and stoned them for
[44:40] it honestly that's what happened because
[44:43] you know it's easier to preach law than
[44:48] Faith come on it's easier to preach law
[44:51] than Faith it's easier to preach a law
[44:54] than Grace it's easier to subdue a group
[44:57] group of people by fear rather than by
[44:59] courage and ability but the prophet said
[45:02] God ha given you his courage and his
[45:04] ability do you believe you have the
[45:06] ability see amen that's the thing amen
[45:09] that the devil don't want you to believe
[45:11] n we are more than cockers in Christ
[45:14] over all these things whatever they are
[45:16] we're going to get through it
[45:20] folks now of course they wasn't
[45:21] preaching to this
[45:24] congregation but that's what happened in
[45:26] the Bible because it was a mixed
[45:29] audience so they picked up stones and
[45:32] they stoned them and God turned around
[45:33] and said I'll tell you what I'm going to
[45:34] do because you've stoned my children you
[45:36] not believe my promises your your
[45:38] carcasses is going to rot in this
[45:39] Wilderness and I'm going to destroy the
[45:40] whole thing and I'm going to get people
[45:42] that can believe me and while God's
[45:43] going off Moses says hold
[45:47] up now think about this all of a sudden
[45:50] Moses has got a better idea than
[45:53] [Music]
[45:54] God come on Church brother said that's
[45:58] Christ and Moses that was Christ in
[46:01] Moses that wasn't Moses but God's
[46:04] ability of Counsel had come into a
[46:06] mortal man and he was counseling God
[46:09] hold on Lord don't kill him don't
[46:11] destroy him Lord cuz we took them out of
[46:14] Egypt as a group and they're going to
[46:16] say down there in Egypt that the god of
[46:18] Moses is not God enough to deliver the
[46:21] children into the land so don't let your
[46:23] reputation be tarnished and God said
[46:25] okay amen I won't this destroy them all
[46:27] I'll save two of them and I'll leave
[46:29] them out here until another generation
[46:31] Rises up that's like Caleb and Joshua
[46:34] amen because they have believed my
[46:36] promises do you see what Moses did with
[46:38] God he said to him your reputation God
[46:42] your reputation what they're going to
[46:43] say about you do you recognize that God
[46:46] was interested in his reputation that
[46:48] people that heard about the God of Moses
[46:52] and the god of Abraham he wanted them to
[46:54] know he is a delivering God and he able
[46:57] to deliver thee from the hands of
[46:59] Egyptians he's able to deliver thee from
[47:01] the hands of Philistines and give you
[47:04] the possessions that he wants it's his
[47:06] reputation on the
[47:08] line and you can you imagine now y'all
[47:11] know what I'm talking about because that
[47:12] generation come up later David David
[47:14] goes in the promised land amen and he's
[47:17] over there fighting and he comes up and
[47:18] sees a whole bunch of his brothers and
[47:20] they're sitting on the side of the hill
[47:22] and the prophet said they were all just
[47:24] basically Paralyzed by fear got so
[47:27] scared they couldn't
[47:29] move one place brother Bram said they
[47:31] turn Yer he said their liver messed up
[47:33] on
[47:34] them scared the liver out of me
[47:37] says took me a while to catch that one
[47:40] when you Scar the liver out of somebody
[47:42] they turn
[47:47] yellow but brother B said when David
[47:49] walked up there and saw the
[47:52] situation and what it was
[47:57] he said ' let me go fight this
[48:01] fell he's the youngest among
[48:04] them he's not got
[48:07] weapons yeah he's not got anything of a
[48:11] of a of a background of a soldier he's a
[48:14] hard playing curly-headed
[48:18] boy with a slingshot
[48:21] yeah let's just get it out
[48:24] there but he knew that he was watching
[48:27] his father's
[48:29] sheep and he had saw that Gods was not
[48:33] going to allow amen a line to take them
[48:35] sheep so God gave him ability to deliver
[48:38] sheep and he gave him ability to kill a
[48:42] bear and he said now the god that killed
[48:45] this Lon and killed this bear he's the
[48:47] same kind of God that's going to deliver
[48:49] this uncircumsized Philistine into my
[48:52] hands and I love it because when he went
[48:55] off the when he went off into the B he
[48:57] didn't he didn't go off into battle with
[48:58] Saul's armor and I I know you've heard
[49:00] these things but I I think it's pretty
[49:02] good cuz Saul tried to put something on
[49:04] him he said now wait evented I ain't
[49:05] tried this stuff
[49:06] out I ain't proved I ain't proved what
[49:09] you're trying to put on me right you see
[49:12] sometimes people try to put ideas on you
[49:14] they try to put doctrines on you I don't
[49:17] know about all that amen but the God
[49:20] that I serve the one I met out there in
[49:22] the wilderness he can kill Lions he can
[49:24] kill bears and I didn't have no armor
[49:26] home when he did it because I'm not
[49:28] trusting in my armor I'm not trusting in
[49:30] my strength I'm trusting in the god of
[49:33] Abraham and that young boy took off of
[49:35] that Hill glory to God brother Seth he
[49:38] took off running into the battle I tell
[49:40] you there's some confidence right there
[49:42] as a man with confidence when he runs
[49:44] into the battle that looks impossible to
[49:46] happen but he knew God was on his side
[49:49] and I always love how oh oh oh Goliath
[49:52] he must not been a very smart man cuz he
[49:54] stood down there and cursed David and
[49:55] said he's going to hang him up and the
[49:57] birds were going to eat him and he told
[49:59] him all these things he were going to do
[50:01] had he been a Bible reader he would have
[50:02] knew that God had said whoever blesses
[50:05] Israel is blessed and whoever curses
[50:07] Israel is cursed amen so I say this he
[50:10] was messing up because he was speaking
[50:12] his own destiny he was speaking exactly
[50:15] what God was going to do with him when
[50:18] David got down there and one Little Rock
[50:20] did him in can you imagine amen he was
[50:23] such a he was such a powerful thing such
[50:25] a powerful man man when it looked like
[50:27] he had all the odds but one Little Rock
[50:30] did him
[50:31] in it wasn't David and it wasn't the
[50:34] Rock brother BR said God got in the
[50:37] Rock yes sir God got in the Rock he was
[50:40] slinging it like this and through the
[50:42] Rock and brother said God got in the
[50:43] Rock he told how fast it went it went
[50:46] beyond the speed of sound can you
[50:47] imagine when it broke sound barrier
[50:49] sound like a missile went off down there
[50:50] in that Valley and they thought good God
[50:52] what kind of weapon has he broke out I
[50:54] tell you what kind of weapons sister l
[50:56] was a weapon of praise that's what he
[50:58] broke out he broke out a praise for his
[51:00] God and he become a weapon in his hand
[51:03] and he said my God's able to slay these
[51:05] Giants and he let that rock go and it
[51:07] did its business because God was behind
[51:10] it because God is
[51:15] able he said brother
[51:18] white you know but will God but but
[51:22] really is God a deliverer now here's the
[51:25] thing
[51:27] as a Bible reader Daniel has always been
[51:29] a beautiful book to me because it's the
[51:31] children of God took down into Babylon
[51:33] who had all these Gods yeah and they
[51:36] didn't know any of their gods had power
[51:37] like these little Hebrew children
[51:42] knew the scripture declares that they
[51:45] you know what they did they you know for
[51:47] our Sunday school children and things I
[51:48] know y'all probably know these things
[51:50] but let me just say this they what they
[51:52] were doing was they was forcing worship
[51:55] on the Hebrew children
[51:57] they were forcing their type of worship
[51:59] that's what was going on they had made
[52:01] an image of the Prophet
[52:05] Daniel and they were playing music and
[52:08] they were forcing the Hebrew children to
[52:11] bow to their own Hebrew
[52:13] Prophet now brother Bram said now we're
[52:15] nearing the end and as it went out so it
[52:18] will go out in this
[52:20] age and they were forcing them to bow to
[52:23] their own Hebrew
[52:25] Prophet now that's that's that's pretty
[52:26] powerful stuff yeah and when they got
[52:30] forceful with it they told them they
[52:31] said we're going to destroy you right so
[52:34] so they Nebuchadnezzar's laws were were
[52:37] were put in place and in Daniel chapter
[52:39] 3 I love the way he says this these men
[52:41] were brought before them basically
[52:43] Nebuchadnezzar says to them you guys are
[52:45] not worshiping at this image and
[52:48] basically I'm going to give you another
[52:49] chance here in front of me and when this
[52:52] thing begins to happen I want you to
[52:54] kneel down and worship he said or you
[52:57] shall be cast the same hour in the midst
[52:59] of a burning furnace and who is the
[53:03] god that shall deliver you out of my
[53:08] hands Daniel 3:15 and who is the can you
[53:12] imagine that and who is the god that can
[53:16] deliver thee out of my hands well I tell
[53:18] you what you're about to find
[53:19] out he's about to find out these men
[53:22] served a God that was able he was able
[53:25] to take a out of a fiery furnace and I
[53:28] want you to see this because we're not
[53:29] just talking about a fiery furnace back
[53:31] there we're talking about suffering and
[53:33] afflictions of our lives and the enemy
[53:35] has tried many times I know what it
[53:37] feels like if you'll just back up we'll
[53:39] back up but that's a lie they're not
[53:41] going to back up that's like this this
[53:43] nonsense of having two states in Israel
[53:45] like it's going to bring peace it ain't
[53:46] going to bring peace it's a lie the
[53:49] devil's lying to you you back up and
[53:51] I'll back up no he's just going to move
[53:53] closer that's all it's going to happen
[53:56] it's a lie the devil's lying to you and
[53:58] he was lying to these boys amen but I'll
[54:00] tell you what they did when the fiery
[54:02] furnace come on the Bible tells us that
[54:04] they were threw into that furnace seven
[54:06] times harder of course Le oia and they
[54:08] were B they were thrown in seven times
[54:10] harder and they went inbound now brother
[54:13] Bram says it like this he said what did
[54:15] they do while they were in that fire I
[54:18] always wondered and brother Bram said
[54:20] what did they do he said I tell you what
[54:22] happened he said God came out of the
[54:24] heavens he said he came out of the
[54:26] heavens and said a man-sized job I'll do
[54:28] it myself and he went right by the Sea
[54:31] of life and picked off a palm leaf and
[54:34] went down in the furnace and was breeed
[54:37] he said with that palm leaf and was
[54:39] blowing the heat off of them and while
[54:42] they were in the furnace they were
[54:44] sitting under the wind of God and
[54:46] brother Bram said he was fellowshipping
[54:47] with them about their future he was
[54:50] talking to him about tomorrow he was
[54:52] talking to him about what's going to be
[54:54] after this Le DEA ended there he went
[54:56] right there amen that's what it's going
[54:58] to be after it's uh I'm not trying to
[55:00] see things anybody else see that that
[55:02] fire just went right over your head
[55:03] there Christopher just just like that
[55:05] through the building amen I'm going I'm
[55:07] going to talk to you about your future
[55:08] that's what's going to happen you may be
[55:10] in a fiery furnace of Affliction you may
[55:13] be in the toughest time in your life but
[55:16] the God that I serve he able he's able
[55:19] to come down in the fire with you look
[55:21] what he done when he got down in that
[55:23] fire amen when them children of Israel
[55:25] when they come out the next morning I
[55:27] always love this B when they come out
[55:29] the next morning amen they didn't even
[55:31] stink like smoke you know the only thing
[55:34] that was different about them they have
[55:36] went inbound and they come out loosed
[55:39] and let me say this morning I don't care
[55:41] what you're going through the only thing
[55:44] it can do is loose a praising you
[55:47] because our God is able he's able to
[55:51] deliver he's able to come in the fiery
[55:53] furnace he's able to move in the midst
[55:55] of this amen I don't believe I don't
[55:58] believe that our God is just some God
[56:00] somewhere off Amen in a far and distant
[56:02] land and he's a God that used to be and
[56:05] God that don't care that's a lie he's
[56:12] able He's Able you said I never seen it
[56:15] before and maybe you're the first person
[56:17] God's going to use to do
[56:22] it in Romans 4 I love how it speaks when
[56:26] it says of when it says of of Abraham
[56:28] you got to watch this the wording he
[56:30] said he was fully
[56:32] persuaded he was fully persuaded that
[56:36] what he had promised he was able to
[56:39] perform Abraham didn't look at Sarah
[56:41] didn't look at his body didn't look at
[56:43] the condition but he knew this I'm
[56:45] persuaded what God promised he is
[56:50] able to
[56:53] perform now if God promised it
[56:57] He's
[56:59] Able isn't that something because watch
[57:02] watch what what happens here he's able
[57:04] to perform this is if you haven't
[57:07] listened to the sermon while go listen
[57:08] to it this is the sermon brother Brandon
[57:10] preaches a sermon intitled is there
[57:15] anything too hard for the
[57:18] Lord it was exactly the quoting of the
[57:21] scripture in Genesis 18 and4 is there
[57:24] anything too hard for the Lord it's in
[57:27] Jeremiah 32 and 27 is there anything too
[57:31] hard for the Lord I say no there is
[57:33] nothing too hard for the Lord I say God
[57:36] is able to do anything all things are
[57:39] possible and to you that believe it's
[57:41] not just possible with God it's possible
[57:44] with you because he's God this morning
[57:47] all things are possible he is able to
[57:49] raise the
[57:50] Dead come on Abraham believed it he was
[57:53] going to take his child up there and
[57:55] sacrifice the child and they said how
[57:57] you going to do it Abraham he said he
[57:59] said he gave him to me from the dead
[58:01] that he's able to raise him from the
[58:03] dead and he wasn't worried about Isaac
[58:06] because the promise said he would have a
[58:07] nation come out of the child listen if
[58:10] God gave you a promise he'll test you on
[58:12] the
[58:14] promise you would have thought 25 years
[58:17] waiting for a baby's enough test but
[58:19] after he got the
[58:21] child after he was living with a
[58:23] Vindicated word
[58:26] are you hearing me after he got the
[58:29] message God tested him on the
[58:34] message yes sir and it was then after
[58:37] that he possessed all things I'll say
[58:38] this this morning if you're looking at
[58:40] the message and you're trying to figure
[58:42] out if it's right let me promise you
[58:44] this it's
[58:45] right and let me say this to you the
[58:48] message ain't on trial it's your faith
[58:50] on trial God ain't on trial this morning
[58:53] it's your faith is on trial it ain't
[58:56] whether God can do it or not it's can we
[58:58] believe that he can do it it ain't
[59:00] whether the message is right or not it's
[59:02] do we believe the message is right he is
[59:05] able this morning he is able to do it
[59:08] amen I love how it was spoken I was
[59:10] spoken there with John when John said
[59:13] God is able these stones to rise
[59:16] children under Abraham another way he
[59:18] uses it able God is able these stones to
[59:21] rise children unto Abraham in other
[59:23] words you man you can kick him out if
[59:25] you want to he'll get something to
[59:27] worship
[59:29] Him John was actually talking about
[59:32] Pharisees and churches that wasn't
[59:34] accepting Jesus and he said it's okay
[59:37] God's able these
[59:39] stones to rise children under Abraham
[59:42] and brother Bram says he updates it a
[59:44] little bit brother Bram updates it and
[59:46] says it like this don't you think to
[59:47] yourself that you have a World Council

[1:06:34] takes you 34 parts to tell somebody how
[1:06:37] to get born again maybe you got that
[1:06:39] more confused than it needs to
[1:06:41] be let me give you let me give you one

[1:06:45] get born again he said repent every one
[1:06:48] of you amen and re and be baptized in
[1:06:51] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:06:52] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:06:54] receive the of the Holy Ghost always
[1:06:57] remember Romans 10:9 believe on the Lord
[1:07:00] Jesus with thine heart and confess him
[1:07:02] with thy mouth and thou shall be saved
[1:07:05] he is able to save he's able to do that
[1:07:08] which you don't think he can do he
[1:07:10] remains to be
[1:07:15] God I know people's in fear everywhere
[1:07:17] right now people's living in fear
[1:07:19] everywhere right now is is the doctrines
[1:07:21] or we going to get in false doctrines is
[1:07:23] this Doctrine going to take the message
[1:07:25] over and this going to take it listen if
[1:07:27] God got this message through William
[1:07:30] brandom and his rejections and all the
[1:07:32] the denominations that tried to stop
[1:07:34] that man and he got a man in his hand to
[1:07:37] preach this message among all that
[1:07:39] nonsense and got it on record and got
[1:07:41] you in his hands and put this church
[1:07:43] together and set you in the middle of
[1:07:45] this church don't you know the god that
[1:07:47] started is a God that finishes he that
[1:07:50] has begun shall also finish this because
[1:07:53] he's able to do it he's able to keep it
[1:07:56] he's able to do what you have said and
[1:07:58] keep it until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:08:00] amen I I just just just real simple amen
[1:08:03] you you look in Jude 1:24 and watch what
[1:08:05] he says here Jude is talking about false
[1:08:08] false teachings he's telling you in the
[1:08:11] book of Jude how that they crept in how
[1:08:13] dogmas and denominations and how things
[1:08:16] have happened he's telling you all
[1:08:18] that and then you know what he does he
[1:08:21] says now unto him that is able to keep
[1:08:25] you from
[1:08:27] falling and to present you faultless
[1:08:30] before the presence of the glory with
[1:08:32] exceeding Joy unto him that is able
[1:08:35] Jesus said they would deceive the very
[1:08:38] elect if it were possible but it's not
[1:08:41] possible because you're harnessed to an
[1:08:44] absolute there is a jean seed on the
[1:08:47] inside of you you might fool me for a
[1:08:49] day but there's something on the inside
[1:08:51] of me that's going to come out to God
[1:08:54] because he said he would keep us if from
[1:08:56] falling in other words we will not be
[1:09:00] deceived do you know when God Saves a
[1:09:01] man he saves him for Time and
[1:09:05] Eternity let me let me just say this
[1:09:07] very clearly do you know when God gives
[1:09:08] a man the Holy Ghost it's it's
[1:09:11] impossible for that man to
[1:09:14] perish I don't have time to read now I
[1:09:17] got the quotes here but the prophet of
[1:09:19] God said this very clearly when you
[1:09:20] receive he said that's the only reason
[1:09:22] New Birth is salvation because the new
[1:09:25] Birth by the Holy Ghost is not you
[1:09:27] saying you're saved you receive Zoey
[1:09:30] life and you could be no more lost than
[1:09:32] God is lost because you got God's life
[1:09:35] on the inside of you he is able see it's
[1:09:38] in John 10 where Jesus said my sheep
[1:09:41] know my voice and I give unto them
[1:09:43] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:09:46] and neither shall any man pluck them out
[1:09:48] of my hand Hallelujah nobody can plck
[1:09:52] you out of the hand of God ain't no
[1:09:54] doctrines ain't on Ministries that come
[1:09:57] on I don't care how great they are I
[1:09:59] don't care what the devil's doing he
[1:10:01] will never take the bride out of the
[1:10:03] hand of almighty
[1:10:05] God under him that's able to keep you
[1:10:08] he's able to keep
[1:10:10] you from falling I thank God this
[1:10:14] morning that I'm not in a position amen
[1:10:18] that I'm so nervous that I can't even
[1:10:21] sleep because I'm worried that I'm going
[1:10:23] to fall amen
[1:10:26] a real believer no
[1:10:28] matter what they are thoroughly
[1:10:32] satisfied the life that's in them has
[1:10:34] already become
[1:10:37] Christ and there is
[1:10:39] nothing somebody shouting
[1:10:42] nothing that shall separate
[1:10:46] you so preacher how is that possible
[1:10:49] brother baham told us this he said the
[1:10:50] blood didn't bridge the gap it removed
[1:10:52] the gap
[1:10:56] so there just ain't no Gap there no
[1:11:00] more it just removed it how you going to
[1:11:03] fall you standing on level
[1:11:07] ground Anchored In Christ under him that
[1:11:10] is able to keep you from falling you
[1:11:12] have been eternally born into Christ
[1:11:16] listen ain't no
[1:11:18] different ain't no different when Jesus
[1:11:20] was on that boat and they going across
[1:11:22] the sea and look like they were going to
[1:11:23] sink then look like it for sure
[1:11:26] and they got all upset but brother Bram
[1:11:28] said the thing is he said Jesus was on
[1:11:33] board and when Jesus came up he was
[1:11:36] able he was able to calm the storms he
[1:11:40] was able to cause the waves to cease
[1:11:42] listen brother Bram said see Jesus was
[1:11:44] in that ship he said now today we're
[1:11:48] just a bunch of mud
[1:11:49] ships and some of us are made out of
[1:11:51] Arkansas mud and some Ohio mud and some
[1:11:54] Alabama mud
[1:11:56] but that's all you are is mud yeah but
[1:11:59] there's a life in
[1:12:01] you and the same life that was in God is
[1:12:04] the life that was in that ship is in you
[1:12:06] this morning how secure were those
[1:12:10] Believers in the middle of that
[1:12:12] sea if Jesus is on board you can't
[1:12:17] sink you have the same security of your
[1:12:20] eternal life this morning with Jesus in
[1:12:23] the ship somebody said well I ain't seen
[1:12:26] him in a while well then wake him
[1:12:29] up the God that saved you wake him up
[1:12:32] he's still able to calm the Seas he's
[1:12:34] still able to speak to storms he's still
[1:12:37] able to create squirrels he's still able
[1:12:39] to cause the to get up and walk
[1:12:42] he's still able to open the blinded eyes
[1:12:44] he's still able to give the Holy Ghost
[1:12:46] he's still able Our God ain't changed
[1:12:51] any I know we've been through the storms
[1:12:54] and we've been beat up and everything's
[1:12:55] trouble but let me say
[1:12:57] this it's the devil's job to try to
[1:13:00] destroy you okay but Jesus said this to
[1:13:04] Peter he said Peter I want you to know
[1:13:06] something the devil has desired to sift
[1:13:08] you as wheat but I have prayed for
[1:13:12] you well I tell you what I'd rather have
[1:13:15] him praying for me than anybody else and
[1:13:17] let me tell you what he prayed he prayed
[1:13:19] a Thanksgiving prayer like you sat down
[1:13:21] over a meal that's already prepared
[1:13:23] sitting on the table and you start
[1:13:25] thanking the lord for the meal on the
[1:13:27] table Jesus thanked the Lord for the
[1:13:30] disciples that he had given him and he
[1:13:33] said Lord don't take them out of the
[1:13:34] world but keep them from Evil while they
[1:13:37] are in the world look what he done he
[1:13:39] began to tell them I know the devil
[1:13:42] wants you and look even Peter even Peter
[1:13:45] played in the hands of the
[1:13:49] devil
[1:13:51] sure brother brother Bram said it I
[1:13:54] think it's amazing
[1:13:55] he said Peter stood up against that that
[1:13:57] Pharisee Roman soldier and cut his ear
[1:13:59] off he said but he didn't have one ounce
[1:14:01] of Christian
[1:14:03] Courage he said he stood back a far off
[1:14:06] and watch Jesus be
[1:14:08] crucified and stood at the fire of the
[1:14:10] enemy and warmed his
[1:14:13] hands but when he went up till on the
[1:14:15] day of
[1:14:16] Pentecost he said Peter when you are
[1:14:19] strengthened when you're converted I
[1:14:20] want you to strengthen the Brethren and
[1:14:22] what was he going to strengthen with
[1:14:24] listen it's in first First Peter chapter
[1:14:25] 1 and verse 5 you say preacher how are
[1:14:28] we held let me just say this to you amen
[1:14:30] Peter says we who are kept by the power
[1:14:34] of
[1:14:35] God through faith under salvation will
[1:14:38] be revealed in the last times amen let
[1:14:40] me say here's here's the meaning kept by
[1:14:43] the power of God those who are defended
[1:14:46] like a person in a
[1:14:49] fortress kept by the power of God let me
[1:14:53] say this morning he's able to keep you
[1:14:56] he's able to keep you from
[1:14:57] falling he's able to keep you from being
[1:15:00] deceived he's not just a deliverer he's
[1:15:03] a
[1:15:06] keeper he's one that gives the Holy
[1:15:08] Ghost and he don't take it
[1:15:11] back come on Church brother said when
[1:15:14] you're saved you're saved eternally
[1:15:16] saved he said you might go out there and
[1:15:19] backslide but how could God ever change
[1:15:21] his mind come on it's what he said and
[1:15:25] if a man was ever saved he's always
[1:15:27] saved if he was ever
[1:15:29] saved then he's always saved sobody said
[1:15:32] well I believer couldn't backslide
[1:15:34] that's a lie the prophet of God said he
[1:15:36] could

[1:15:39] fact you could backslide every day if
[1:15:42] you ain't today in better shape than you
[1:15:44] was yesterday then you backslid on God
[1:15:47] but let me tell you it didn't change

[1:15:52] has done in your life listen brother man

[1:16:01] redemption he said matter of fact if you
[1:16:04] get it right do it while you got a s
[1:16:05] mind he said because someday fever might
[1:16:08] boil your mind till you ain't got a good
[1:16:10] one he said you may lay on a death bed
[1:16:12] and say curse words and everything else
