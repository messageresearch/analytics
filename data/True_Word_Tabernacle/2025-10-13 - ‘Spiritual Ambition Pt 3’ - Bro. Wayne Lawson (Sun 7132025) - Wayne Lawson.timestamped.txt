[7:18] He is alive.
[7:25] Amen.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He is our He is our reigning
[7:29] king this morning, isn't he?
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is alive. Amen. He's alive and
[7:35] well this morning. Amen. Sitting at the
[7:38] right hand of God in supreme power.
[7:41] Amen. He is alive. Amen. It is a a
[7:46] beautiful morning to be in the house of
[7:48] the Lord. Amen. And to see his wonderful
[7:52] grace as it comes. We've been uh been
[7:54] thinking much about uh the service this
[7:56] morning and there's things upon our
[7:58] heart and I I certainly believe that we
[8:01] have a an issue in this age and a
[8:04] mandate. Amen. That we would uphold the
[8:08] great name of Jesus Christ and and that
[8:11] we would worship him and serve him as
[8:13] children of his great kingdom. Amen. And
[8:17] as we're thinking of it this morning of
[8:19] the great grace that he'd given us and I
[8:22] just want to play that little portion of
[8:24] tape this morning just uh maybe just to
[8:26] put into your hearts and mind some of
[8:28] the things that you know I think it was
[8:30] so amazing uh as a prophet was speaking
[8:32] these things years ago and people were
[8:34] catching even there in New York you can
[8:37] hear it uh in the background you can
[8:39] hear the people really catching what
[8:41] he's really saying to the people is that
[8:44] there is an existence of a kingdom Amen.
[8:46] Where Jesus is king. Amen. And he's
[8:49] certainly he's certainly that for us
[8:51] this morning. Amen. Uh if we could
[8:54] today, you know, I just just listening
[8:56] to this tape this morning. The Messiah
[8:59] uh was listening to it quite a bit
[9:00] yesterday. And in that tape, Brother
[9:03] Brandham says something. It's just it's
[9:05] just remarkable. Uh he's talking about
[9:07] in Mark 16 when Jesus said, "They shall
[9:10] lay hands upon the sick and they shall
[9:11] recover." He said, 'You know, they put
[9:13] that to the test the other day. And he
[9:15] said there was a man sick in the and he
[9:17] said, uh, a believer laid their hands
[9:20] upon them and began to sincerely pray
[9:23] and said they they caught on the X-ray a
[9:25] light leaving that man's body and going
[9:29] into the one he was praying for. And
[9:31] they caught it on the X-ray. And brother
[9:32] Bram said, "See, the Bible knew what it
[9:34] was talking about because when you got
[9:36] saved, God took your cosmic light." And
[9:39] Brother Bram says it was changed to
[9:41] eternal light.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; And now that light lives inside every
[9:46] believer
[9:47] &gt;&gt; this morning. Amen. You You may not
[9:49] recognize it, but you have a great a
[9:52] great authority. You carry a great light
[9:55] within you that this dark world needs
[9:57] and and brethren need it and your
[9:59] sisters need it and the other citizens
[10:01] and and sometimes, you know, just as we
[10:04] would bow our hearts this morning in
[10:05] prayer, I wonder with that knowledge,
[10:08] would you just reach over and put your
[10:09] hand on someone and pray for them this
[10:11] morning? Maybe there's a special need in
[10:13] their life, a a need of touch, a
[10:16] healing, a deliverance, maybe an answer,
[10:19] an encouragement, something they need
[10:20] from the Lord. Amen. Let's pray
[10:23] together. Father, Lord, as we lay our
[10:26] hands one on the other,
[10:29] your prophet was eyes, Lord, and he
[10:31] helped us to see another realm. That we
[10:34] understand this morning that there is a
[10:36] power. There's a power that you put in
[10:39] every believer, Lord, and that light
[10:42] running one from another this morning,
[10:44] agreeing.
[10:46] You said it in your Bible, Lord, that if
[10:48] any two would agree upon one thing. And
[10:51] I'm asking this morning, Lord, as these
[10:53] believers begin to pray, may the power
[10:55] of your light, may it push away every
[10:58] dark feeling. May it push away every
[11:01] dark spirit, Lord. every spirit of
[11:03] infirmity, Lord. Every bondage, Lord,
[11:06] everything the enemy would do to hinder,
[11:09] I pray, Lord, this morning that may that
[11:11] great light begin to press it away from
[11:13] your child this morning, Lord, as they
[11:16] lay hands one on the other, believing,
[11:18] Lord, that prayer changes things, that
[11:21] prayer makes a difference, Lord. And
[11:23] we're asking you now, invoking the
[11:25] greatest power we know of, Lord. And
[11:27] we're asking now, Lord, that changes
[11:29] would begin to happen, Lord, as we issue
[11:32] this in the spirit realm, in the name of
[11:34] Jesus Christ. We ask you, Lord, that now
[11:37] as you have commissioned us to stand
[11:39] here today and to speak the things which
[11:42] you have placed in your word. I pray
[11:44] that that great anointing would come and
[11:46] take a hold of us, Lord, that you would
[11:48] set the man aside and that you would
[11:50] minister to the need of this assembly.
[11:52] And Lord, that you would speak to their
[11:54] hearts from the youngest and the and the
[11:56] weakest of the Christian, Lord, to the
[11:58] elder and to the strong one. Father, may
[12:01] you strengthen and courage. May you heal
[12:03] them, Lord. May you anoint them, Lord.
[12:06] Bring joy and gladness and peace, Lord,
[12:09] as your word has made great promises to
[12:11] these people. Now, Father, we invite you
[12:14] now to take a hold of this this meeting,
[12:17] Lord, and lift it in the power of your
[12:20] word. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. And
[12:24] amen. And and God bless you this
[12:26] morning. If you have your Bibles, let's
[12:29] go to the sacred word of God and and
[12:31] read uh the word this morning. There's
[12:34] something here in Matthew 6 and 33. I
[12:37] just want to read this verse. I'll also
[12:40] read Colossians 3 verse 1 and two. I
[12:42] didn't give that to you, but I'm going
[12:43] to read Colossians 1 uh 3:es 1 and 2. Ma
[12:47] Matthew 6 and verse 33. This is the
[12:50] words of our Lord Jesus. Matthew 6
[12:53] and33.
[12:55] But seek ye first
[12:57] the kingdom of God
[13:01] and his righteousness
[13:03] and all these things shall be added unto
[13:07] you. Let's look in Colossians chapter 3
[13:10] verses 1 and two. Colossians 3:es
[13:15] 1 and two. Now if you then be risen with
[13:19] Christ,
[13:21] seek those things which are above,
[13:25] where Christ siteth on the right hand of
[13:27] God. And I've always loved this
[13:29] scripture. Set your affection. That
[13:32] means it's changeable. It means you can
[13:34] take it from one thing and you can set
[13:36] it on a different thing. Set your
[13:39] affection on things above, not on the
[13:43] things of this earth. May God bless the
[13:45] reading this morning as you be seated.
[13:47] Amen. I I certainly uh believe uh uh in
[13:51] his mercy, his grace. I want to maybe if
[13:53] I could just take one more uh thought of
[13:55] of this today in this area. Um I keep
[13:58] thinking it's the last one then
[13:59] inspiration. So uh but I'm going to
[14:02] speak to you again this morning on
[14:03] spiritual ambition. This would be uh the
[14:05] third part of this uh on spiritual
[14:08] ambition. And uh I I want to read here
[14:10] again from Eagle Stare at his nest.
[14:12] Brother Bram said, "The church of the
[14:13] living God is built on high ambition."
[14:18] The church of the living God is built on
[14:20] high ambitions. And when I hear of a
[14:22] church that hasn't got any ambition to
[14:24] grow, there's something wrong with that
[14:26] church. The church of the living God is
[14:28] built on high ambitions. And and and
[14:32] I'll just take this little segment. He
[14:34] says, "Its ambitions is high. Its
[14:36] anticipations is high. its expectations
[14:39] is high because it's built high. Amen. I
[14:43] I certainly believe that the the
[14:45] ambition of the church of the living God
[14:47] is high ambition. I I I believe that God
[14:50] has set us on high ambitions and and
[14:53] that we we as a church uh I believe that
[14:56] we have ambition but as an individual we
[14:58] also have ambition and I don't want to
[15:00] look at it in the negative realm but
[15:02] rather also in the positive and and look
[15:04] at the ambition because our ambition is
[15:06] not just ambition but we have found out
[15:09] that there is expectations and
[15:11] expectations are those that are birthed
[15:14] out of promises. If I tell you I'm going
[15:16] to do something, you have every right to
[15:18] expect what I promised you you can have.
[15:21] And when God made promises concerning
[15:23] the church, then those promises have now
[15:25] become our expectations. Amen.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; And so we uh we we definitely have
[15:31] expectations or ultimate goals and those
[15:34] goals are coming from the word of God.
[15:36] Now, if you're going to have a goal and
[15:39] you're going to have an ambition, amen,
[15:41] there's going to have to come
[15:42] dedication. there is uh laying aside
[15:45] things. There are things that won't go
[15:46] along with what it is that you're
[15:48] wanting to achieve. So you have to make
[15:50] uh decisions and those decisions are
[15:52] based on uh I want to do this so I'm not
[15:56] going to be able to do this at the same
[15:57] time. So you have to choose the value of
[16:00] what you're placing on that goal. So a
[16:03] real spiritual ambition is something
[16:05] that you're willing to give up things so
[16:08] that you're able to achieve a certain
[16:10] thing. Uh and and I I think it's amazing
[16:13] because uh when you think about real
[16:15] ambition and and you want to do
[16:17] something, you're going to have to learn
[16:19] uh some some things that the prophet
[16:21] taught on very strongly like
[16:23] perseverance. meaning that you don't
[16:26] hold it until the first trouble comes,
[16:28] but you hold it even when trouble comes
[16:31] or whenever there is frustration or uh
[16:34] there's a there's there's something that
[16:36] is an opposition to what it is you're
[16:38] desiring to do that you have to be able
[16:40] to persevere through that. And you know,
[16:42] I you often look in the scripture and I
[16:44] think it's amazing when the woman with
[16:46] the issue of the blood, you know, Amen.
[16:48] she had to press through the crowds and
[16:50] sometimes uh you got to press through
[16:52] when things are not comfortable to you.
[16:54] When you some people say, "Well, I don't
[16:55] like Brooks, brother Wayne. I don't
[16:57] really." But see, you have an ambition
[16:59] and sometimes that ambition makes you
[17:01] press through a crowd to get to a
[17:03] certain place. You know, a woman with a
[17:05] sick a daughter. She actually pressed
[17:07] through and and and she kept crying to
[17:10] the Lord and she was wanting to touch
[17:11] him. She's needing something from him.
[17:13] And when he turned to look at her, Amen.
[17:16] finally, he didn't he didn't talk to her
[17:17] a while, but when she finally got his
[17:19] attention, even then, he called her a
[17:21] dog. Amen. And but she was so set on
[17:23] what it was she wanted, she couldn't be
[17:25] offended by him. But she just agreed
[17:27] with the word and said, "Lord, yes, I'm
[17:29] a dog, but even dogs get the crumbs from
[17:31] the master's table." So this was woman
[17:33] with ambition. She was somebody willing
[17:35] to overcome, to persevere, to get to the
[17:38] place that she was desiring to get.
[17:40] Amen. And and I think about this morning
[17:43] that that overcomers, and I I believe
[17:45] that's what I'm talking to today. I
[17:47] believe we're discussing uh overcomers
[17:49] and and their ambitions. And I love how
[17:51] brother Brandham will say things. He
[17:53] said then he said, "Brother Brandham,
[17:55] people say uh uh uh uh you know that
[17:58] we're waiting on Jesus to return." He
[18:00] said, "Actually, Jesus is waiting on
[18:02] us."
[18:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "You say, well, how could uh
[18:06] what could we do about that?" He said,
[18:07] "Well, the Bible said the hour has come
[18:10] when the bride has made herself ready."
[18:13] Amen. So, there is a there is a a duty
[18:16] of the church of the living God. Our
[18:18] part of the coming of the Lord is our
[18:21] getting ready. How many knows that
[18:22] Brother Bram said the only thing holding
[18:24] off the rapture is the readiness of the
[18:25] church.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we recognize then that we do
[18:29] have something to do that we have a
[18:30] duty. Amen. And that duty is brother
[18:33] Benam says is to get ready. That's
[18:35] right. See the bride hath made herself
[18:38] ready. The garments is paid for. They're
[18:40] ready. But you must be ready to wear
[18:43] those garments. Amen. Now and I'll read
[18:46] another Revelation chapter 4. Brother
[18:48] Bram says this, "When a Christian's
[18:50] first saved, he his face is turned
[18:51] towards Christ. And then he's got
[18:53] something to do himself." See, the next
[18:56] thing is to sanctify himself from all
[18:58] the unclean habits. He begins to lay
[19:00] aside every weight. He begins to make
[19:02] himself ready. See, the bride will make
[19:05] herself ready. Amen. I I love this. And
[19:08] he says it like this. See, there's going
[19:09] to be a meeting in the air. Now, he's
[19:11] going to give us a goal. There's going
[19:13] to be a meeting in the air one of these
[19:15] days in the sweet by and by. Just stay,
[19:18] Nick. Now, now just get ready, of
[19:19] course. But then you've got to stay
[19:21] ready. You got to keep yourself ready.
[19:24] You purge your heart from evil things.
[19:26] So, so we could say to ourselves,
[19:27] "Brother Wayne, I've already got ready."
[19:29] But Brother Ram said, "You got to stay
[19:30] ready." Amen. And And if it's a a day or
[19:33] it's a week or it's a year, amen,
[19:35] there's a bride ready waiting upon the
[19:39] coming of the Lord. I've often said it
[19:40] like this. Don't don't wait to get
[19:43] ready. Get ready and then wait on the on
[19:45] the on the meeting that's in the air.
[19:48] See, because right now I certainly
[19:49] believe brother Ma'am says in the
[19:51] marriage of the lamb, we know that these
[19:53] things are going to make up a bride.
[19:54] It's going to be the church and they're
[19:56] going to appear before him without spot
[19:58] or wrinkle and they have the material on
[20:01] earth now to make themselves ready. So
[20:05] somebody says, "Brother Wayne, what's it
[20:06] really mean to get ready?" He says, "You
[20:08] you got the material on earth now." Now,
[20:11] now it's amazing because you're going to
[20:13] be clothed in the word of this message.
[20:16] Amen. Y'all know that it's the rejection
[20:18] of this prophet is the dressing of this
[20:20] bride. The very rejection of the message
[20:23] of the hour. The reason brother Brandham
[20:25] was rejected was to produce a material
[20:27] for a bride so that she would be
[20:29] spotless and without wrinkle. He could
[20:31] have easily went away or went went along
[20:34] with denomination and the systems of the
[20:36] ages. And he could have personally
[20:38] excelled further in his ministry had he
[20:41] set aside the idea that he had a greater
[20:44] ambition than to build his own personal
[20:47] ministry or his own church or his own
[20:49] following. Do you'all know Brother Bram
[20:51] said he never even came to build a
[20:53] following?
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Do you know he said it? I never came to
[20:57] build a following. I never came to build
[20:59] an organization. He said, "I come to
[21:01] build powerhouses." Y'all remember that?
[21:03] Amen. And and and he said that his
[21:05] rejection is, amen, that he would clothe
[21:08] this bride. Amen. In the word so that
[21:10] the church could uh uh become spotless
[21:13] and without wrinkle. Amen. That they
[21:15] could be clothed themselves. Now, if you
[21:16] like to study in the masterpiece, you
[21:18] can go study it. But it's a powerful
[21:20] area. Brother said before she could be
[21:22] masterpiece bride, she had to have all
[21:23] the pieces. He said that's the reason I
[21:26] went out to Tucson. he said was to get
[21:28] that see from the material or the
[21:31] perfection of this church. We've got
[21:33] something to do and that's to overcome.
[21:35] Now we overcome by that message. In
[21:37] other words, there's a there is a a
[21:40] standard that we're looking to and that
[21:42] standard is the word of God. Now,
[21:44] somebody said, "Well, I tell you,
[21:46] according to the Lutheran, it's this
[21:47] way, and according to the Baptist, it's
[21:49] this way, and according to the secular
[21:50] church is this way." But see, if you're
[21:52] wanting to be that spotless bride that
[21:55] is found in the scriptures, there's only
[21:57] one message on the earth today that's
[21:59] going to prepare you for that s if
[22:01] you're wanting to overcome that you're
[22:03] going to make yourself ready to meet
[22:05] him. Amen. You can learn a lot from the
[22:07] book of Esther, can't you? Amen. That
[22:09] Esther was was one that understood, I
[22:12] only want whatever it is that is told me
[22:15] I need. Amen. Because see, people might
[22:17] want a lot of things, but it ain't what
[22:19] we want, it's what we need. Is that
[22:22] right? Amen. Brother Rams preaches on it
[22:24] a lot. He said, you know, uh maybe a
[22:26] young kid wants a certain thing, but
[22:27] they they don't they they want it, but
[22:29] they don't need it. And God knew what we
[22:32] needed, not what we wanted. Amen. And
[22:35] what we needed was a prophet of God.
[22:37] What we needed is a word of God that
[22:39] could prepare our lives. Amen. Amen.
[22:41] That's what really we need. We need the
[22:44] opening of the seven seals. We needed a
[22:47] filter that could wash us. Amen. Amen.
[22:49] And that's exactly what God sent us when
[22:52] he sent us this message. Amen. Because
[22:54] God is not intending to push you through
[22:57] a knot hole. Amen. God is not in
[23:00] intended to push us through and then
[23:02] pull us out on the other side. He said,
[23:05] uh, and then say, "Blessed is he that
[23:07] overcomemeth."
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; He's not going to push you and pull you
[23:10] and then say, "Blessed is he that
[23:12] overcomemeth." He says, "See, you have
[23:15] nothing to overcome if he just pushed
[23:17] you through. But you got to make a
[23:19] decision for yourself.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. A decision for myself to show
[23:24] faith and respects to God. I love how he
[23:27] says that we got something. We got to
[23:28] make a decision. It's a clear-cut
[23:30] decision that we are going to live for
[23:32] God. We've got to make that decision
[23:34] ourselves. God can't do that for us. We
[23:37] have to do that ourselves.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Now, now, Brother Brandham says, "See,
[23:41] Jesus then is waiting on this bride to
[23:43] make herself ready." Now, if we live in
[23:46] the age we're living in and you look
[23:48] back in the Old Testament and you see
[23:49] Joshua and Caleb and you watch them
[23:51] going into the Canaan land, many people
[23:54] like to type that as the millennium.
[23:55] Brother Ram said, "It's not the
[23:57] millennium." He said, "Because there
[23:58] won't be any war or death in the
[24:00] millennium." He said, "It is a type of
[24:03] the overcomer. It's the age of the
[24:05] overcomer." See, this is the age now of
[24:08] the overcomer. This is when your
[24:10] overcoming is done. I know. I know. We
[24:13] we we say it a lot like Lord I'm ready
[24:15] to go home. Amen. But you recognize he
[24:17] put you here. Amen. To overcome.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; That he literally put you here to
[24:22] overcome. He didn't put you here just so
[24:24] you can melt away and say, "Lord, I
[24:26] can't handle it no more. I'm just going
[24:28] to go home." He He put you here knowing
[24:31] that that the human race fell into time
[24:34] out of Eden as a defeated people. But
[24:37] when this bride returns back to glory,
[24:40] she will not return a defeated church.
[24:43] She will return a victorious church
[24:45] wearing the seven colored virtues of his
[24:48] character because she has stood the
[24:52] test. And brother, you know these
[24:53] quotes, brother said it clearly. He
[24:56] says, you see, he says, uh, only thing
[24:58] you're going to take from here is your
[25:00] character.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; So if you want to take a shortcut and
[25:03] get out of here so you don't have to go
[25:05] through no trials. Amen. Where are you
[25:07] going to get your character? Their only
[25:09] character is only brought out of the
[25:12] furnace of affliction.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Kind of like going to an Indian. How
[25:16] many of you like Indian food? I I used
[25:18] to when I first went to India, only
[25:20] thing I knew about pork chops and and
[25:22] corn and mashed potatoes and gravy and
[25:24] homemade biscuits. I was a hill boy. And
[25:26] it and we had pork chops and we had
[25:29] homemade biscuits and gravy and then we
[25:31] had corn and then we had corn and then
[25:34] we had gravy and mashed potatoes and
[25:37] then we had fried chicken one night in a
[25:39] week maybe. I mean that was it, man. If
[25:41] it was lasagna or it's all mixed
[25:43] together couldn't take that.
[25:46] It was, you know, Amen. If it wasn't
[25:49] pork chop or fried chicken, forget it,
[25:52] man.
[25:54] That's just, you know, baked chicken,
[25:55] you don't mess it up, you know, you fry
[25:57] it. And but when I went to India, I I I
[26:00] just couldn't cuz everything's a soup
[26:01] and it they just hack it all together,
[26:03] you know, and they throw it all and boy,
[26:04] it was rough at first, but then I I
[26:06] started developing a little taste for it
[26:08] and I got to liking it. And one of my
[26:10] favorite things about the Indian foods,
[26:12] that naan bread. Y'all like that naan
[26:13] bread?
[26:14] &gt;&gt; At that if you hadn't had naan bread,
[26:16] you ain't living yet now. You got to get
[26:19] you some naan bread. But if you go to a
[26:22] restaurant uh you can go to even
[26:24] restaurants in India and they don't have
[26:26] naan bread. It the first question you
[26:28] don't have to ask do you have naan you
[26:30] can ask this question do you have
[26:31] tandoori oven because they they you
[26:34] can't get real naan without a tandoori
[26:37] oven. See they have an they take that
[26:40] bread and they throw it against the
[26:41] inside of that and that that cook you've
[26:43] been over there. That's where they get
[26:44] it. You got to have that tandoori oven.
[26:46] Amen. And you see that's the only place
[26:48] you can get real naan is out of that
[26:49] tandoori oven.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; And you know you'll never really get
[26:53] true character without the furnace of
[26:55] affliction.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; You'll never furnace of affliction is
[26:58] the only place that true character comes
[27:01] from. Amen. It it is where God shows a
[27:04] believer how to suffer. Amen. And that
[27:07] suffering then causes a character that
[27:10] the Bible says is as pure as gold. that
[27:13] it literally is more precious to you
[27:15] than your gold because it's character
[27:18] that is given to you out of the furnaces
[27:20] of affliction. Now, there is things that
[27:22] you've got to overcome and there are
[27:24] situations and I know some of you
[27:26] probably want maybe one of your
[27:28] overcoming it's one thing and to another
[27:30] person it's another thing but there's
[27:32] overcoming.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; As long as you're in this human body
[27:36] there's overcoming. Amen. Amen. And we
[27:38] find out that there are there are
[27:40] places, amen, that is an overcoming that
[27:43] later after you overcome it, you get to
[27:45] eat the sweetest honey you've ever
[27:47] eaten. Have you ever read the story of
[27:49] Samson when he was going along and the
[27:51] Bible said a young lion jumped out and
[27:53] and it was going to take him and the
[27:55] power of God struck him and he and he
[27:56] killed the lion and and and threw it
[27:58] aside the side where they were. And
[28:00] later he comes along. Amen. And and he
[28:03] went in and found that lion. And when he
[28:05] looked in there, there was a swarm of
[28:07] bees had come over and began to build a
[28:10] nest in there. And that honey was in the
[28:12] carcass of that line. And brother Ram
[28:14] said when they took it out of there, he
[28:16] said, "Oh my, that was sweet honey." He
[28:19] said, "But see it was something that
[28:21] Samson had killed by the power of God
[28:24] and it was the sweetest honey a man
[28:26] could ever eat." And he said, "So is
[28:28] it." Amen. When you get that place of
[28:30] overcoming after you get on the other
[28:32] side of it and you can sit around and
[28:35] tell somebody that testimony how you
[28:37] suffered so and how this situation come
[28:39] up you didn't know if you could ever get
[28:41] over it but all of a sudden you have a
[28:43] testimony you never had before that God
[28:46] could overcome a temper or God could
[28:48] overcome a feeling of of negativity or
[28:51] some kind of depression that was in your
[28:53] life and and and you faced it and you
[28:55] thought I'll never get past this but the
[28:57] spirit of God come in a meeting one day
[29:00] and just like that it was gone. Amen.
[29:03] Because you pressed and you held on
[29:05] until the spirit of God took it out of
[29:07] your life and then later you're telling
[29:09] somebody, "I didn't think I'd ever get
[29:10] over it, but I just kept believing and I
[29:13] just kept persevering. I just kept
[29:15] believing." And then God came over me
[29:17] one morning and it was gone. And you can
[29:20] tell it, brother, and you can eat it.
[29:21] You you you could that testimony. It
[29:23] just makes you feel so good.
[29:26] You know when the devil tells you you
[29:27] ain't saved and you ain't got the Holy
[29:29] Ghost, you know what you really need?
[29:31] You need to pick up the phone and tell
[29:33] somebody about the day you got the Holy
[29:35] Ghost. Tell them about the day that God
[29:38] filled your life and how it changed you
[29:40] and how that you was this way and now
[29:42] you're this way. I tell you, it'll feed
[29:44] that experience on the inside of you.
[29:47] You'll feel the honey and the person
[29:49] you're talking to. Amen. They'll they'll
[29:51] feel the charge of the anointing. Amen.
[29:53] I I just love a good old testimony. You
[29:56] know, it it shuts up the devil
[29:57] sometimes.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; A good old testimony. Y'all remember in
[30:01] the scripture when they dug the valleys
[30:03] full of ditches? Y'all remember that
[30:04] they took and dug the valley full of
[30:06] ditches and Elisha prophesied and said
[30:08] there won't be no storms and and there
[30:10] won't be no rain. He said, "But in the
[30:13] morning, these ditches will be full of
[30:14] water."
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember that? And what that was
[30:17] about was that the waters that had been
[30:20] released in Moses's day was under that
[30:23] sand. And it was all still there. It's
[30:25] it's a good revelation. The spirit on
[30:27] the day of Pentecost, it's still here.
[30:29] But see, it had went down and there were
[30:31] so many things between the people, the
[30:34] army and the and the spirit that they
[30:36] had to dig through it. And that was
[30:38] Elisha's prophecy was dig through these
[30:40] things. And you'll hit solid rock in a
[30:43] minute. And when you get through it,
[30:44] you'll find out the spirit of God is
[30:46] still the same as it was on the day of
[30:49] Pentecost. And the Bible says that
[30:51] whenever they got done, God instructed
[30:53] them. He said, he said, "Go over there
[30:55] in the enemy's land and you fell every
[30:57] good tree and you take a rock and stop
[31:00] up every well of the enemy." And brother
[31:02] Brown picks that little story up and he
[31:04] said, "That's right. You take your rock
[31:06] of testimony and you go right into the
[31:08] enemy's camp and you put it right over
[31:10] that fountain, that whale, that one that
[31:12] says God don't heal." You put your
[31:14] testimony, Brother Guthrie. shut up that
[31:17] devil's whale and say, "Yeah, God does
[31:19] heal because he healed me." Amen. And
[31:22] and you can eat that honey, that
[31:24] sweetness of that testimony. Because you
[31:27] know God does heal. Somebody said, "I
[31:29] tell you what, God don't really deliver
[31:30] from temper." I tell you that he does. I
[31:33] tell you that God does deliver from
[31:35] temper. And if you've got a temper,
[31:37] don't you settle with just saying,
[31:38] "Amen. I'm just a bad mood or I I feel a
[31:41] little bad or he's a little grumpy." No,
[31:43] he ain't grumpy. He's got an old spirit
[31:45] on him and it's a devil. It's a temper
[31:47] thing.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; And if you let it go, it's a murdering
[31:51] spirit that came from the Bible. It said
[31:54] that Cain killed his brother Abel.
[31:56] That's a murdering devil.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why would you want to pack that
[32:01] thing around?
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, preacher. Preach a little
[32:06] while. You know what it is? Amen. You
[32:08] You You know what it means to harbor a
[32:10] spirit? Y'all know what that means? To
[32:12] harbor a spirit means that you're giving
[32:14] safe passage and you're protecting a
[32:17] spirit so as that it can do damage.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; So don't you ever give place to a devil.
[32:23] Don't you give place. Don't you harbor
[32:25] some little grudge or some feeling that
[32:28] temper or anger has caused to come out
[32:30] because you your spirit you harbor that.
[32:33] Amen. And allow it. But that thing wants
[32:35] to kill your brother.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; You I'd never kill my brother. Brother
[32:39] Rem said, "When you mar the testimony of
[32:41] a brother, you might as well have took a
[32:42] knife and stabbed him when you destroyed
[32:44] his influence."
[32:46] &gt;&gt; But you see, God wouldn't cause a person
[32:48] to do that. It's some old spirit. But if
[32:50] you ever really get free of that spirit,
[32:53] you can stand on the street corner and
[32:55] tell the world, "God can deliver a man
[32:57] of temper. God can deliver a jealousy.
[33:00] God can give you." See, because you've
[33:02] got that overcoming in your life, and
[33:05] that's up to you to overcome. Some
[33:07] things it seems like they just move so
[33:09] quick. You ever noticed that? Brother
[33:10] Ray, you probably, you know, probably
[33:12] one of the oldest Christians in the
[33:13] building right here. He remembers when
[33:15] he first got saved. And some things they
[33:17] were just gone. But there was other
[33:19] things
[33:21] &gt;&gt; that you had to overcome it.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; You had to overcome it. Don't you think
[33:27] that becoming a Christian, a magic
[33:29] wand's going to come over you and all
[33:31] your troubles are going to go away.
[33:34] It's going to put out a nice little
[33:35] feather bed for you and you can come and
[33:37] lay down and and being a Christian. If
[33:39] you get that in your mind, you'll have
[33:41] the Holy Ghost and not even know you got
[33:43] it
[33:44] &gt;&gt; because you'll think, "What have I got
[33:45] this trouble for if I got the Holy
[33:47] Ghost?" Well, let me tell you that Holy
[33:49] Ghost was given to you to war against
[33:52] the things that is in this human nature
[33:55] that's in there from your daddy and from
[33:57] your mama and from the situations of
[33:59] your life. Amen. Listen, I I say this.
[34:02] Amen. Amen. Sometimes it seems like
[34:04] after you become a Christian, you got
[34:06] more battles than you had before you was
[34:08] a Christian. But you know why? It's
[34:10] because you got tired of going
[34:11] downstream and just floating and you
[34:14] turned around. Now you're going upstream
[34:15] and it's a battle. But brother, we're in
[34:18] it for the battle. We're not here just
[34:20] to play a game. But we're here to love
[34:23] God and to serve him despite the
[34:25] situations that happen in life. It's the
[34:28] sweetest honey that you have ever eat.
[34:30] comes out of the carcass of a lion that
[34:32] you killed.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; My sometimes God makes you overcome it,
[34:37] friends.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; He'll step back and say, "It's your turn
[34:40] now." Amen. You're going to have to
[34:42] You're going to have to hold on and push
[34:44] through this. Now, I'm not talking about
[34:46] salvation. I'm talking about your
[34:47] overcoming.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; The overcoming of your life. You My good
[34:52] might as well preach, haven't we? Since
[34:53] we drove all the way up here. you know,
[34:55] you got an old gossiping spirit going on
[34:57] and you and you got that spirit on you
[34:58] where you just can't wait, amen, to get
[35:01] off the phone, to get on the phone and
[35:03] tell somebody else, you know, and and
[35:05] just even if it's a prayer request, you
[35:07] know, amen, you you got to, well, pray
[35:09] for this brother or pray for this
[35:10] situation going on. You disguise it how
[35:12] you want to.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; But gossip is just gossip.
[35:17] Somebody asked me one time, Brad, they
[35:19] said, they said, "Brother Wayne, is it
[35:21] gossip if it's true?"
[35:24] [Music]
[35:26] I like that old as a kid, we watched
[35:28] that old Heihaw. I probably shouldn't
[35:29] tell it, but we wasn't going to church,
[35:31] but hey, they they had a little song
[35:33] they sang. Says, "We don't we don't
[35:36] repeat gossip, so you better listen
[35:37] close the first time.
[35:41] [Music]
[35:47] So, what you want? Hey y'all, it's it's
[35:50] the joy bell and it's his birthday
[35:53] today. God bless you, buddy.
[35:56] It really is his birthday.
[35:58] Happy birthday, buddy.
[36:06] You know, but but it's an overcoming. So
[36:08] sometimes you have to stop and go, why
[36:12] am I doing that?
[36:14] &gt;&gt; That is just horrible.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; So then you you you and you say, well,
[36:18] I'm not going to do that. And you start
[36:21] and and sometimes it takes an
[36:22] overcoming.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; It takes you it may take once. It may
[36:26] take twice. It may take a week. You
[36:28] might fall back into it another week,
[36:30] but then you're going to say, "I'm not
[36:33] giving up the battle."
[36:35] See, don't give up the battle of it just
[36:38] because you have to struggle against it.
[36:40] Amen. Because it's your overcoming. It's
[36:42] something, Brother Bam said, you got to
[36:44] do something God gave you to do. And I
[36:46] know that's odd coming from me cuz I'm
[36:49] always preaching the other side of this.
[36:50] Amen. But brother Bram said, "When I see
[36:52] uh that old old life that I once lived
[36:55] and and it's dead as all midnight, I
[36:58] tell you, I raise my hands and praise
[37:00] the Lord and eat the sweetest honey I
[37:02] ever ate in my life."
[37:05] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Bam says it like that.
[37:07] He said, "Faith is a conqueror and faith
[37:09] is an overcomer. It isn't a peacemaker.
[37:12] It overcomes." See, it overcomes the
[37:14] world. What does that? It's its faith.
[37:17] See, see, to conquer means a victory.
[37:20] It's to conquer. It means to beat down.
[37:23] I like to beat that devil down. Don't
[37:25] you sometime just beat that thing down.
[37:27] He says to beat down. It's to override
[37:30] it. It's to handcuff it. Amen. It's to
[37:33] throw it into prison. It means the sin
[37:36] that once ruled you, you rule it now.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; My goodness, wouldn't that feel that
[37:44] thing that used to rule you?
[37:47] And I'll tell you this this morning. If
[37:48] something's ruling you, I'm giving you
[37:50] instructions right now how to rule it.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; How can I turn how do I turn the table?
[37:55] This is how you do it. You get an
[37:57] objective in God that I'm going to
[37:59] possess this land that God's gave me and
[38:02] I've got a right to do it. Amen. And
[38:04] then I can overcome it because faith is
[38:06] a victory that overcomes every curse of
[38:09] this devil. Amen. Brother Brham says
[38:11] when you get to climbing into God, you
[38:13] climb into there by power until you see
[38:15] the thing conquered under you. Then
[38:17] there is something that nothing can hurt
[38:20] you. Then you have overcome it. You've
[38:22] got 50 miles of elbow room. Amen. 50
[38:26] miles of elbow room. Tell somebody,
[38:28] scoot over a little. I need some elbow
[38:30] room. I'm about to praise the Lord.
[38:32] Amen. I I've been suffering with
[38:34] something for for maybe two or three
[38:35] years of my life, but right now I feel
[38:37] like I could just break through that
[38:39] thing and I don't have to I don't have
[38:41] to suffer with it anymore. Listen, you
[38:44] suffering child. Amen. You have pressed
[38:46] the bottle, but get on the other side of
[38:48] it and you'll get some elbow room.
[38:51] You'll be able to move around and shout
[38:53] a little bit. Oh, give me some more of
[38:55] that honey. Amen. Let me let me get a
[38:57] mouthful of the glory of God. See, you
[38:59] got 50 miles of o elbow room. And I love
[39:02] how Brother Bam says it. And you've been
[39:04] a drunkard and a slave to whiskey.
[39:06] You'll be a master over it. Then that
[39:08] old devil of alcohol that made you
[39:10] drink, he was your master, but you're
[39:12] his master now. When you get faith, I
[39:15] don't mean make believe. He says it
[39:17] becomes your servant. If you can't lay
[39:19] down that tobacco, you women and men,
[39:21] when it comes to a place where you can
[39:23] get to that spot to where you overcome
[39:25] it by faith, you'll master it then. And
[39:28] I I love his I love his concept that
[39:30] what once masters you, you begin to
[39:33] master it.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I in Isaiah chapter 14, you watch
[39:38] Isaiah speaking and he's prophesying
[39:40] concerning the Israelites that have been
[39:42] under the Chaladans. And now he said,
[39:44] "For the Lord will have mercy upon
[39:46] Jacob, and he will choose Israel and set
[39:48] them in their own land, and the
[39:50] strangers shall be joined with him, and
[39:53] they shall cleave to the house of Jacob,
[39:55] and the people shall take them and bring
[39:57] them to their places, and the house of
[39:59] Israel shall possess them in the land of
[40:02] the Lord for servants and handmaidadens,
[40:05] and they shall take them captives whose
[40:08] captives they were, and they shall rule
[40:10] over their oppressors." I just love that
[40:14] they shall rule over their oppressors.
[40:17] The thing that had you captive, I tell
[40:19] you this morning, you have got every
[40:22] authority of almighty God to take that
[40:24] thing captive and place it under your
[40:27] foot. That's what that's what Paul
[40:29] taught. He said, "Take captive every
[40:31] imagination even of evil and cast it
[40:34] down where that thing that once ruled
[40:36] you, now you are ruling over it."
[40:39] Rulers, you can become a ruler right
[40:41] here this morning. take that thing
[40:43] because most of the things that is
[40:45] oppressing you, Amen, isn't even
[40:47] physical, is it? It's something that's
[40:49] in your mind or something that's in your
[40:51] spirit. So if you could, if it's not
[40:53] something physical, couldn't it change
[40:55] right here, even in the building right
[40:58] now, if you could get faith that God has
[41:00] caused this, amen, to believe, Amen. You
[41:03] you you see, Brother Bam is showing you
[41:05] when you begin to rule it, you get down
[41:08] to business. Y'all know what that means?
[41:10] Get down to business.
[41:12] and get down to business with God.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; That means the playing's over.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Get down to business.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in faith is our
[41:22] victory. He brings up a woman. He and
[41:24] she's sitting present. Bless her heart.
[41:27] He said she's sitting present right here
[41:29] now. And she come up to this altar time
[41:32] after time. a good woman, but she
[41:36] started smoking
[41:38] a long time ago and she just couldn't
[41:40] overcome that.
[41:42] Now he says smoking, let now why don't
[41:45] you put yours in there
[41:48] and just just just forget the smoking
[41:49] part and put put your put your
[41:52] overcoming problem there
[41:54] &gt;&gt; and look what he says. And she would
[41:56] come up time after time and then I would
[41:58] pray with her but it seemed like she
[42:01] couldn't overcome it. And the first
[42:03] thing you know, I told her, "There'll be
[42:06] danger down the road." She said,
[42:08] "Brother Brandham, I have cried and I
[42:10] have begged." You see, emotional is just
[42:13] fighting the air.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; It won't do any good.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; I I I I'd get down and pray with her.
[42:21] Now, this is a prophet. I would get down
[42:24] and pray with her and lay hands on her,
[42:27] and she'd go back in a few days and I'd
[42:29] meet her and she'd just knock you down
[42:31] with cigarette smoke.
[42:33] He said, "But one night down yonder, she
[42:35] went to a doctor to get sick, begin to
[42:38] get sick and wither away and that little
[42:40] spinly thing." And the doctor looked
[42:42] into her and said, "Cancer,
[42:44] smoking cigarettes." There she was
[42:48] laying there to die. Then she got down
[42:51] to business.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; See, a drowning man will reach for a
[42:54] straw. As long as you can walk out of
[42:56] this church tonight and know that you
[42:58] can join the Methodist or the Baptist,
[43:00] as long as you can sit in here and say,
[43:02] "Well, I'm a pretty good person. There's
[43:04] nothing wrong with me." See, you can't
[43:06] do nothing with you.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; As long as you can say, "Brother Wayne,
[43:10] I'm okay like I am. I don't I don't need
[43:14] any help. I He said, "See, there's
[43:16] nothing I can do with you."
[43:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "But when you see your sins as
[43:21] God sees them,
[43:24] When you see it like, well, it was just
[43:26] a little temper fit. God says it's
[43:28] murder.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; It was just a little look, God says it's
[43:31] adultery.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; It He sees it differently than you see
[43:36] it.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; And Brother Bam says when you see your
[43:40] sin as God sees it.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; He said in the light of this Bible, then
[43:45] you'll repent or perish. Something's
[43:47] going to take place. Then you'll get
[43:49] down to business. Yeah.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says it uh and I I
[43:53] love how he says it. He said, "Now,
[43:56] uh he says,"Now, what is it?" It's faith
[43:58] that overcomes. Why didn't it overcome
[44:02] when I was praying for her?
[44:05] &gt;&gt; This is a prophet. This is a word
[44:07] prophet.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Why didn't she overcome when I was
[44:10] praying for her? Why would it did I pray
[44:13] with her and she just go back and come
[44:14] and go back and come? Why was it? And
[44:16] brother Bam says, "I was praying for
[44:18] her." It was because she was just
[44:19] fluttering around.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; But when the doctor says you got cancer,
[44:24] she got down to business.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, you got to get down
[44:28] to business with God. Amen. We can we
[44:30] can pray with you till we're blue in the
[44:32] face, but if you're just fluttered
[44:33] around, if you're if you're if you're
[44:35] not serious, if you're not seeing it as
[44:37] a real problem, if you if you see gossip
[44:39] as just a little problem, you'll never
[44:41] get over it. If you see lust and
[44:44] pornography as just a little problem,
[44:45] you're never going to get over it. If
[44:47] you see temper fits as a little pride,
[44:49] you're never going to get over it. If
[44:50] you see impatience and selfishness and
[44:52] jealousy as just a little, well, I wear
[44:55] a long dress. Amen. I got long hair. It
[44:57] don't matter if I am the most jealous
[44:59] person that ever lived. See, see, I'm a
[45:01] good person. I fit the standards. Amen.
[45:04] But what about the standards of
[45:05] character?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; What about the character of Jesus Christ
[45:09] that's supposed to be exemplified in the
[45:11] age we're living in?
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:15] See, then when you start looking at
[45:17] that, I I told a brother one time, I
[45:19] used to travel a lot, you know, and I
[45:20] preached to a lot of preachers as much
[45:21] as I did to congregations, and me and
[45:23] brother was talking. He said, "Brother
[45:24] Wayne," he said, "It don't even seem
[45:26] like I need an altar in my church
[45:27] anymore." And I said, "If you're just
[45:29] teaching, you're never going to need
[45:30] one.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; As long as you're just teaching, you're
[45:33] talking about the blood and grace, you
[45:34] probably never even going to need an
[45:35] altar. But if you ever start taking the
[45:37] character of Jesus Christ, and we have
[45:40] to compare ourselves with that
[45:41] character, brother, we're going to need
[45:43] an altar. And the altar is not something
[45:45] just to get saved at. It's something to
[45:47] die at.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Amen. Is somewhere to
[45:51] die. Do y'all believe in dying? Amen. I
[45:53] believe dying is worship.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; I I certainly believe that when David
[45:57] was sacrificing all them bulocks in
[45:59] front of the in front of the uh the ark
[46:01] that was coming. The Bible said David
[46:03] was dancing before the Lord, but he also
[46:05] was slaying bullocks every six steps
[46:08] because see there is worship and death.
[46:10] Amen. And when we begin to die, that's
[46:13] really when we begin to worship God.
[46:15] Because true worship is letting the word
[46:17] come into our lives and something's got
[46:20] to die to make room.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; We got to make room. Amen. That the Holy
[46:24] Spirit can move in our lives. Amen.
[46:26] Getting down to business with God. See,
[46:28] getting to that place where we're ready
[46:30] to die out. You know, Brother Bam said,
[46:32] "I want some death sounds in the
[46:33] church."
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Y'all know that, right? He said, "We
[46:36] need death sounds in the church." Like
[46:38] that first sound. He said when Abel's
[46:40] lamb was dying, he said, "Listen to the
[46:42] bleeding of that lamb." He said, "When
[46:44] our lamb was dying at Calvary, he be to
[46:47] speak with other tongues." Amen. He was
[46:49] dying on the cross. And I believe the
[46:52] church has got a place to die to tonight
[46:54] and this morning. Sometimes when you're
[46:56] dying out, sure you cry out in tongues.
[46:58] Sure, you find a language that you're
[47:01] not able to.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't have the language
[47:06] you need to talk to God.
[47:08] That's Romans 8. The Bible said he
[47:10] giveth you utterance.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; The spirit helps you.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now you get down to business.
[47:21] What it means is live or die, sink or
[47:23] swim. This I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[47:25] get by this point in my life.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Now, when you start seeing it the way
[47:29] God sees it, now you're understanding
[47:32] that God made you to be free.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; He made you to live in liberty. God
[47:37] never intended for his believers to live
[47:40] bound by some kind of spirit.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Now, now when when you see this, you
[47:46] understand Brother Bam's great uh a
[47:48] great love for this man Arnold von Winkl
[47:51] who who who gave his life for
[47:52] Switzerland. Y'all remember?
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was a he was a great he was a
[47:56] great warrior and and and Switzerland
[47:58] was coming where they was facing an army
[48:01] that was going to take away their
[48:03] liberties. And this man went out and
[48:06] looked and saw what was coming. He says,
[48:08] "There's no way we can defeat this army.
[48:10] There's just no way that this army is
[48:12] going to get defeated because they had
[48:13] these great big long spears." And and
[48:16] and they would they would be able to
[48:17] spear the men before they ever got amen
[48:20] to the place. There's no way to break
[48:21] through their ranks. They couldn't even
[48:23] get within 10 or 12 feet of them, let
[48:25] alone break through their ranks. But
[48:26] this Arnavon Winkl, he's he just rises
[48:29] up for Switzerland. the army of farmers
[48:31] behind him. He he he pep talks them.
[48:33] Said, "Everybody get something in your
[48:35] hand. I don't care if you're a warrior
[48:37] or a farmer, you can fight because we're
[48:40] going to fight for liberty." And he
[48:41] makes this grace announcement. He said,
[48:43] "Today, I give my life for Switzerland."
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And I just I just love his story. Amen.
[48:50] I give my life for Switzerland. I give
[48:52] my life for my children. I give my life
[48:55] for my wife. Amen. You go tell my you go
[48:57] tell my family I love them. But this
[49:00] day, I'll give my life that they might
[49:03] experience freedom, that they might
[49:05] maintain and keep the freedom that God
[49:08] has given them. Amen. And I think of
[49:10] when when brother Ram said when Arnold
[49:12] run in there, I've looked at videos and
[49:13] pictures and and and and imageries that
[49:16] they have made. And you can see a man
[49:18] running into the into the thick of
[49:20] spears. And he reaches out as wide as
[49:21] his arms will go and he gets an arm load
[49:24] of those spears and brings them into him
[49:26] so that they can't withdraw them. And
[49:28] while he's holding their spears in his
[49:31] body, Amen. his men are running around
[49:34] him through the lines of the enemy.
[49:36] Amen. And we have seen our Lord Jesus do
[49:39] that at Calvary. But 2,000 years later,
[49:42] traditions and ideas of man come to bind
[49:45] the church. And here comes a prophet of
[49:47] God that stands right in the middle of
[49:49] traditions. He reaches and gets them and
[49:52] draws them and said, "Go around me,
[49:54] boys. Here's a hole. Here's a hole.
[49:57] Amen. Make way for liberty.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this morning and as a
[50:02] pastor and man, I have the same
[50:03] objection in my life. I'm not here to
[50:06] fight against other churches.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; God help us that we never get that old
[50:10] devil on us here. We're not here to
[50:12] straighten up every church in the planet
[50:14] and every pastor and make sure they're
[50:16] doing it right here and make sure
[50:17] they're doing it right here. Some people
[50:19] may feel they have a global ministry to
[50:21] correct the whole world. I believe that
[50:23] I'm a pastor to a local assembly. Amen.
[50:25] And I pray that we affect the whole
[50:27] world through what God sends out of
[50:29] here. But when you start believing that
[50:32] you're some apostle or some bishop,
[50:36] &gt;&gt; brother Bam said it's the spotting of
[50:37] humanism in the true vine. Amen. It's
[50:41] not from the Lord
[50:42] &gt;&gt; because we are to have liberty as an
[50:45] assembly to sing the songs we want, to
[50:47] preach the song, the sermons we preach,
[50:50] to shout or to worship.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. And that's why we
[50:56] stand as a sovereign body this morning.
[50:58] And and I know our ministering brother
[50:59] goes other places and things. Amen.
[51:01] Brethren, don't never go to another
[51:03] church and think we are to operate like
[51:04] they do here. Okay. Amen. We're going to
[51:06] operate this church the way the Holy
[51:08] Spirit instructs us from the message of
[51:11] the hour. I say make way for liberty.
[51:13] We're not standing against somebody.
[51:16] We're not standing against a bunch of
[51:17] people. We're standing for liberty that
[51:20] is coming to the age we're living in
[51:23] that the presence of God might have some
[51:25] liberty for the church.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said that's when you
[51:29] become an invincible army.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; That's when you become an invincible
[51:33] army. When you know what you stand for.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; And and and I believe we do. I believe
[51:39] we know what we stand for.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; I certainly believe this. I I I stand
[51:44] for something. I'm not just stand
[51:45] against. years ago, it struck my heart
[51:47] when I was studying in the church age
[51:49] book and I saw that the greatest battles
[51:51] and the greatest uh fights and the and
[51:54] the greatest victories of small armies
[51:56] against great armies was when they stood
[51:59] for something.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; They wasn't out on the attack against
[52:03] others,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; but they stood strong for what they
[52:06] believed.
[52:08] And and you see when you stand for
[52:10] something there's always going to be
[52:12] someone well you know you're attacking
[52:15] or you're hitting or you're doing and
[52:17] it's no it's just that there's a
[52:19] resistance to the idea that this church
[52:23] ought to be operated through another
[52:24] assembly or another person or another
[52:26] bishop. Right.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; See that that that it has to be held
[52:31] open for the word of God as a Messiah
[52:35] &gt;&gt; because we are not a part of another
[52:37] ministries's kingdom.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; We are a part of the kingdom of the
[52:42] almighty God. And that kingdom is a
[52:44] kingdom of free men born under the power
[52:47] of God that has liberty to love God.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this gospel. this
[52:55] gospel of the resurrection.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the gospel that that
[52:59] the power of God can walk up and down
[53:01] these aisles and deal with hearts. I'm
[53:03] not ashamed. I'm not ashamed of the word
[53:06] that's been given to us in grace in this
[53:08] hour. I'm not ashamed of the name
[53:10] William Brandom. Can you put that
[53:11] picture up? I'm not ashamed of that
[53:13] name. And and and I I I want to be able
[53:15] to quote that name freely from this
[53:17] church.
[53:19] I
[53:20] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to never see an
[53:21] atmosphere enter our church where our
[53:23] brothers get fearful of quoting a
[53:26] prophet or preaching what he said. Amen.
[53:29] Because we recognize who he is.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody else might not understand or
[53:34] might not recognize, but we know, we
[53:37] understand. And that that that man of
[53:40] course was the seventh angel. He was a
[53:41] prophet from God. But the preachers that
[53:44] we have, that's not about that man. It's
[53:47] above the fire. that's above that man
[53:49] because we believe that that's the same
[53:51] light that led the children of Israel
[53:54] out and then and brought them out under
[53:56] Moses and put them in that promised
[53:58] land. I believe that pillar of fire
[54:00] returned under a prophetic message. And
[54:03] I stand for the idea that that pillar of
[54:05] fire is just as real this morning as it
[54:08] was the night that they took it. And we
[54:10] have invited him. We have invited him to
[54:13] be the chief and head of this local
[54:16] assembly. That he would come and lead
[54:18] us. That he would lead the church in
[54:20] power and in resurrection. That he would
[54:23] make us ready. He would prepare us.
[54:26] Amen. And Exodus people of God. Amen.
[54:29] You see, I'm not ashamed of that. I'm
[54:31] not ashamed of the experience that he
[54:33] taught.
[54:35] I'm not ashamed of his doctrines of
[54:37] serpent seed and water baptism because
[54:39] of the doctrines of Apostle Paul before
[54:41] they were doctrines of William Brandham.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this. I stand for
[54:47] that. I stand for his message. I stand
[54:49] for his experiences. I stand for the
[54:51] belief of angels and the power of God
[54:54] and the pillar of fire and the realities
[54:56] of this message. I stand for that
[54:58] because I'm a Christian.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Before I'm a preacher, I'm a Christian.
[55:01] Before I'm a church member, I'm a
[55:03] Christian. And this ministry has
[55:05] supplied a Christian with the most
[55:08] evidence in the history of the world
[55:10] that Jesus Christ is not dead. He's not
[55:14] in a tomb in Israel. He is alive this
[55:17] morning. He resurrected from the dead.
[55:20] And this message has proven that beyond
[55:23] infallible proofs. If I had to take it
[55:26] to a jury this morning, I say this.
[55:28] There's enough evidence in these books
[55:30] and tapes that we could overemphasize
[55:33] to prove the infallibility of the
[55:35] resurrection of Jesus Christ as a
[55:37] healer, as a deliverer, as a counselor,
[55:40] as a leader, as a guide, as an
[55:43] interpreter of his word, as a
[55:45] manifesttor of his gifts. He is the same
[55:48] Jesus that met Amen. Melazdc that met
[55:51] Abraham, that that the light that met
[55:53] Paul. He's that same Jesus. And I'm a
[55:56] Christian. And I am not ashamed of being
[55:58] a Christian.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; You've heard brother Bam say it. I'm an
[56:03] American. Well, I'm also a Christian.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Not just an American. I'm also a
[56:08] Christian. Amen. And you know, as a
[56:10] Christian, I'm not ashamed of this. And
[56:12] brother Bam said, are you ashamed of the
[56:14] full gospel? Are you ashamed of that
[56:16] Pentecostal experience? Then you're
[56:18] ashamed of his word.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Brother Bam said, "I'm not a
[56:22] Pentecostal." He said, "But I I do have
[56:25] a Pentecostal experience
[56:27] &gt;&gt; because it's not a denomination,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; right? What she stands for." Amen. We
[56:34] need some ministers. Brother Brandham
[56:36] said it. We need ministers.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Right. We need ministers. I believe.
[56:41] Don't y'all believe that? We
[56:43] &gt;&gt; We need some preachers, don't we?
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might want to throw eggs at
[56:47] him right now, but you still need a
[56:48] preacher.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; We need preachers. Yes,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; there's an entire movement right now
[56:58] &gt;&gt; that is trying to do away with
[57:00] ministering gifts.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; To be a true bride, you have to listen
[57:05] to tapes at the same time as other
[57:09] places listen to tapes. Can you imagine?
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine an organization being
[57:16] built in the name of William Brandom?
[57:21] So, Brother Wayne, are you again? No,
[57:22] I'm for the liberty of this church.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Do you see? We're for the liberty of
[57:29] this assembly.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You see? And we need ministers
[57:34] to preach the gospel and bring the
[57:36] church back to a Pentecostal again.
[57:39] Bring it back to an eagle experience.
[57:42] That's what the church needs. We don't
[57:44] want to be chickens.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; We want to be eagles. And I believe we
[57:49] need an experience with God to be to be
[57:51] a real eagle. We need an experience.
[57:53] Brother said, "You cannot receive the
[57:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost without an
[57:57] experience when it happens."
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that?
[58:01] &gt;&gt; I think I'm probably preaching to the
[58:03] choir, ain't I? Amen. You you you you
[58:05] you cannot without an experience. If you
[58:08] believe every speck of this word and you
[58:10] believe every speck of it, that word is
[58:12] laying there waiting for the Holy Spirit
[58:13] to put it to work. I I'll just take the
[58:15] bottom of the quote. until the Holy
[58:17] Spirit gives an a fiery experience comes
[58:19] down and lights that candle, you haven't
[58:22] received the Holy Ghost. You've got to
[58:24] have an experience to have the Holy
[58:26] Ghost.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Wayne, are are you know, you
[58:31] got these ambitions. I I do have
[58:33] ambitions and I I I I tell you the am
[58:35] one of the great ambitions of my heart
[58:38] is that every young person in this
[58:40] building will have the baptism of the
[58:42] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; I pray often, Amen, that God will make
[58:48] sure that every young person that is in
[58:51] this church, Amen, has the baptism of
[58:54] the Holy Ghost. It is the token for you
[58:56] to go into the rapture.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; I I I would like you all to have a good
[59:00] car. I'd like you all to have money and
[59:03] a good house. But above every bit of
[59:05] that, I pray that you receive the
[59:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I pray
[59:09] that I never become neglect. Amen. to
[59:12] preach the realities of this message
[59:14] that would produce a birth in our young
[59:17] people something that could bring an
[59:19] atmosphere to produce a Holy Ghost
[59:21] experience. Brother Bram says, "Amen. A
[59:24] question. Do your children have to have
[59:26] an experience with the Holy Ghost if
[59:28] they see the end time message?" You see
[59:30] that devil started all the way back
[59:31] there? If you just believe the message,
[59:33] then you got your experience. Brother
[59:35] Bams asked the question, "Is that true?"
[59:37] He said, "Everyone must have an
[59:39] experience. Your children cannot go in
[59:42] any other way but the same way you do.
[59:45] They got to be born again. There's no
[59:47] grandchildren in the kingdom of God.
[59:49] They're all children. They must have it.
[59:51] They must have an experience with God
[59:54] the same as you got an experience with
[59:56] God. You broke out of your shell and
[59:59] they got to break out of their shell.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; And you can't really do it for them.
[1:00:03] They have got to do it themselves. Amen.
[1:00:06] They've got to believe. Sometimes you're
[1:00:08] going to have to put up with preaching
[1:00:10] that's that's below where you are in the
[1:00:12] stage of life.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to hear sermons
[1:00:15] preached that's not going to be the
[1:00:17] sermon. Amen. That's specifically for
[1:00:19] the stage that you're living in. But you
[1:00:22] know, I think of the beauty of a of a
[1:00:24] chicken trying to get out of an egg.
[1:00:25] Little little baby. Brother said
[1:00:27] everything I needed was in the egg. He
[1:00:29] said, "But watch. But mama ain't got the
[1:00:31] one job." Amen. She ain't trying to get
[1:00:33] out of the egg, but she is producing an
[1:00:36] atmosphere. And some days even she just
[1:00:39] sits there. But listen, brother, her
[1:00:41] sitting there has got something to do
[1:00:44] with the birth of that child. Amen. And
[1:00:46] you may feel like, "Oh, I'm just sitting
[1:00:48] church. That's all I do. I come and sit
[1:00:50] in church when I say thank God for you
[1:00:53] cuz I need you. I need you to produce an
[1:00:55] atmosphere that we could get a birth in
[1:00:58] the house of God. You can't break their
[1:01:00] eggs, but you can get a you can get an
[1:01:02] atmosphere of receiving, an atmosphere
[1:01:05] of believing, an atmosphere of truth
[1:01:08] that is conducive to a birth. It's the
[1:01:11] atmosphere that does it.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's the atmosphere that does
[1:01:15] it. You can't do anything if you don't
[1:01:16] have atmosphere. Ambition. I have an
[1:01:19] ambition to have an atmosphere that's so
[1:01:22] powerful in this church that healings
[1:01:24] will take place before we ever lay hands
[1:01:27] on them. I have an ambition that people
[1:01:29] will receive the Holy Ghost as it was
[1:01:32] when Peter yet spake these words. Not a
[1:01:35] hand laid on them, not an altar, but the
[1:01:38] power of God so real that it'll ignite
[1:01:41] whatever's on the inside of them. I got
[1:01:44] an ambition that God would take over
[1:01:46] every element of this service and the
[1:01:48] atmosphere will become so rich and so
[1:01:51] real.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory.
[1:01:57] We got to have an atmosphere. Brother
[1:01:59] Bam says to brings results, it brings
[1:02:01] results.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; How many knows Brother Bam believed
[1:02:04] atmosphere is what brings results?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; He preached it several times. But he
[1:02:08] said, "You get the atmosphere right."
[1:02:10] And every man and woman in this building
[1:02:13] this morning, boy or girl, you get
[1:02:15] everything from their minds but the Lord
[1:02:17] Jesus. and believe they're standing
[1:02:19] present right now and you'll see
[1:02:22] something happening that'll cause
[1:02:24] headlines in the newspapers
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; because it's the atmosphere.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; The atmosphere is what brings the
[1:02:32] miraculous.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; You see, amen. Your part of that is
[1:02:36] maybe you don't need a miracle. Maybe
[1:02:37] you don't need a birth. Maybe you don't
[1:02:39] need a healing. You're just you're here
[1:02:41] worshiping the Lord. Don't you discount
[1:02:44] that. Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Don't you listen. Had he write her boys,
[1:02:48] Amen. Look at what's going on there. How
[1:02:50] did Hadtie ever think an Amen would
[1:02:53] bring salvation, but it created an
[1:02:55] atmosphere where the third pull could be
[1:02:58] enacted right there. And I tell you this
[1:03:00] morning, I say bring on the amen. Bring
[1:03:03] it on in the right place and let the
[1:03:05] Holy Spirit ignite the atmosphere where
[1:03:08] God can get a hold of lives. I believe
[1:03:11] it. I believe in the atmosphere of the
[1:03:13] miraculous. I believe in an atmosphere
[1:03:15] of faith where it's I don't want to I
[1:03:17] don't want to get in the place where
[1:03:18] it's an odd thing to believe for
[1:03:20] healing.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be something to start
[1:03:22] telling somebody you're believing for a
[1:03:24] healing and they look at you funny?
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; This ought to be a place where people
[1:03:29] hear that testimony, you know, and say,
[1:03:32] I I've said it a lot. And the reason
[1:03:33] I'll say this, Brother Tyler, sometimes
[1:03:35] God don't reveal to me what's going to
[1:03:37] happen to a person. Sometimes I don't
[1:03:39] know what's going to be their future or
[1:03:41] whether they will be healed or whether
[1:03:43] they won't be healed. But then they'll
[1:03:45] say to me, "Brother Wayne, hey man, I
[1:03:47] have a I have a I have a a revelation.
[1:03:49] God has healed me." And brother Mike,
[1:03:51] every one of them, I'll say this. Now,
[1:03:53] according to the word of God, I'll stand
[1:03:55] on that with you. I'll agree with that
[1:03:58] on you because I don't know, but the
[1:04:00] word of God says you're healed. Then you
[1:04:02] got a right to testify you're healed.
[1:04:04] and we'll stand with you that you're
[1:04:06] healed because it's an atmosphere of
[1:04:09] believing. It's not an atmosphere of
[1:04:11] criticism or the atmosphere I I pray
[1:04:14] that we never get in those kinds of
[1:04:16] atmospheres of of comparisons. Amen.
[1:04:19] But, you know, but an atmosphere of
[1:04:21] grace, an atmosphere where the Holy
[1:04:24] Spirit can brood over the church. And
[1:04:26] brother Bam says, you let them get under
[1:04:27] that atmosphere and they're bound to
[1:04:30] recognize who their father is.
[1:04:33] Now, I believe I believe that that
[1:04:35] sometimes we get in those atmospheres
[1:04:38] and things change. Brother Barham says
[1:04:40] it very clearly. He said, "I want an
[1:04:42] experience, but I want an experience
[1:04:45] that matches the Bible."
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; That's the kind. He says, "Matching
[1:04:49] time." He said, "You ever he said
[1:04:51] everybody's worried about if your coat
[1:04:52] matches your trousers." He said, "I
[1:04:54] really don't care. I I don't think he
[1:04:56] did."
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't care if his coat matched
[1:05:00] his trousers. Amen. But you know what he
[1:05:03] did care about? That his experience
[1:05:05] matched the scripture.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. A scriptural experience. And
[1:05:09] that's the kind of experience we want.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that we would have to
[1:05:14] accept a substitute.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? I I don't believe in
[1:05:21] this message that we would have to
[1:05:24] settle for a substitute of just
[1:05:26] emotions.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it. I don't believe that
[1:05:30] we would just have to settle. We had
[1:05:32] some emotion so we we we were there. I I
[1:05:35] don't believe that's a settlement. I
[1:05:36] don't believe that's where we have to
[1:05:37] settle.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that we could have a
[1:05:40] little sensation or a little goosebump
[1:05:42] and then we that oh that's we got it
[1:05:44] that I don't think we have to take that
[1:05:46] kind of substitute.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a United Church out
[1:05:52] there in the world, a Pentecostal group,
[1:05:54] and they got the evidence speaking in
[1:05:56] tongues as the Holy Ghost. See, they
[1:05:58] settled for a substitute instead of
[1:05:59] getting the real thing.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And and I talked to him one time. I was
[1:06:02] down in there was a big convention going
[1:06:04] on in Florida, and the one of the head
[1:06:05] guys were staying in the same hotel I
[1:06:07] was, and he told me they were having
[1:06:08] that convention. I got to talking to
[1:06:10] him, and I said, "Now that thing y'all
[1:06:11] got on the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:06:13] Ghost's tongues." I said, "How's that
[1:06:14] working out now that you have all these
[1:06:16] bilingual people?" He said, "You called
[1:06:19] it." He said, "We are having trouble
[1:06:20] right now
[1:06:23] because you've taught people if they
[1:06:25] talk in a different language, they got
[1:06:26] the Holy Ghost. Well, what if they know
[1:06:27] seven languages?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, then you've you've you've
[1:06:32] allowed a substitute to take the place
[1:06:34] of a reality. See, we we're not going to
[1:06:37] settle with emotion or we're not going
[1:06:39] to settle with, well, I believe this
[1:06:40] doctrine. We can't settle with, well, I
[1:06:42] joined this church. I belong to this
[1:06:44] group. See, there's no need to settle.
[1:06:46] Amen. Because the skies are full of the
[1:06:48] real.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; There is a reality. Now, somebody says,
[1:06:52] "Well, I'll tell you, brother Wayne, you
[1:06:54] know, we can just settle for the most."
[1:06:55] We don't have to settle for emotion,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; but there's plenty of emotion in it.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Did you see that? You don't have to
[1:07:03] settle for that as a substitute because
[1:07:05] you can have the real and you can have
[1:07:07] the emotion.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; I love I I was just listening to brother
[1:07:11] Bradom yesterday. What does it take to
[1:07:12] overcome all unbelief? And it actually
[1:07:15] originally was titled faith is our
[1:07:16] victory. So, there's two of them, but I
[1:07:18] love how he says it. He said, "I believe
[1:07:20] I believe that I believe the Holy Spirit
[1:07:21] has plenty of motion and anything that
[1:07:24] that that I can prove to you. Anything
[1:07:26] that isn't hasn't got life in it and
[1:07:28] it's dead."
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; So, if the church ain't got a little
[1:07:33] life, there's something wrong with that
[1:07:34] church. It needs a resurrection.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I need I pray God give us
[1:07:40] resurrection power.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; I pray life. Amen. Amen. I I love how
[1:07:44] Brother Brown does it. He says He says,
[1:07:46] "I see." He said, "We're down on the
[1:07:48] basketball floor." He said, "Many
[1:07:49] people, their children here go to school
[1:07:51] and I thank God for beautiful schools."
[1:07:53] He says, "And uh I see it was an
[1:07:55] auditorium." He said, "I've been in
[1:07:56] there many times." He said, "But if you
[1:07:58] had a basketball there," he said, "you
[1:08:00] had a team that was winning." And he
[1:08:02] said, "And you just sat there in the
[1:08:04] balcony." He said, "Well, Amen." Oh,
[1:08:06] well. He says, "That would be the
[1:08:10] deadest game he ever attended."
[1:08:13] He said, "Well, our master's winning a
[1:08:15] fight, and I tell you, if we could do a
[1:08:18] little cutting up once in a while, you
[1:08:21] know, let him know we appreciate the
[1:08:23] victory
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; he's give us." That's right. We don't
[1:08:27] want a dead meeting. We don't want a
[1:08:28] dead church. We want it alive with the
[1:08:31] spirit of God is moving. A real
[1:08:33] sensible, sane gospel.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Just performing great signs and miracles
[1:08:38] of the Messiah. Do you see God? Amen.
[1:08:41] there there would be no reason for us to
[1:08:44] substitute the real for something that's
[1:08:47] partial because you know amen you see
[1:08:50] they take things and make evidences of
[1:08:52] them but we don't have to settle for
[1:08:54] those we literally can continue in to
[1:08:56] the things of the Lord you see the Bible
[1:08:59] tells us that God forneew us
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; right he forneew us and he also did
[1:09:08] predestinate us
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; and that predestin ation is to be
[1:09:13] conformed unto the image of the son. So
[1:09:16] there is a direction of your life.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; It's to become Christlike to be
[1:09:20] conformed into the image of Christ. We
[1:09:24] have a purpose a conformity to Christ
[1:09:26] that that we would become in our spirit
[1:09:30] like Christ is in his.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Now now here's the thing. The work of
[1:09:34] that great Holy Spirit, Amen, it comes
[1:09:37] it comes to perfect. it comes uh uh to
[1:09:40] uh uh uh to conform, to change, to help.
[1:09:44] Now, I love how Brother Brandham says
[1:09:47] it. Church membership's all right. I
[1:09:50] ain't got nothing against it. But,
[1:09:51] brother, to be a Christian means to be
[1:09:54] conformed into the image of Christ.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; And we want to be a living image, not
[1:09:59] pack an image.
[1:10:02] See, we don't want to we don't want to
[1:10:03] pack a little idol around that looks
[1:10:05] like Jesus
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; and say, "See, I'm a Christian." Now, I
[1:10:09] I've literally seen that in India. The
[1:10:11] the Hindus will get them an idol of
[1:10:13] Jesus and they'll put Jesus right up
[1:10:15] there next to Buddha.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Just another God,
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we we're not going to we're
[1:10:22] not going to pack an idol. We are the
[1:10:26] actual image of God. Yes.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are the only
[1:10:31] creature that God created that could
[1:10:34] reflect his image?
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; There is not another creature that can
[1:10:39] perfectly reflect the image of God.
[1:10:41] That's why in the sixth day, he quit
[1:10:43] creating because he had created man.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; But then on the seventh day, God began
[1:10:48] to rest. But in his rest, he gave
[1:10:50] dominion unto men and made them gods. He
[1:10:54] put you as a as a god, as a ruler, that
[1:10:57] you might reflect his will in earth.
[1:11:00] See, that's your dominion. Earth is your
[1:11:02] dominion.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; And you had abilities as a God to
[1:11:06] reflect God's kingdom and God's will
[1:11:08] upon the earth, naming animals and and
[1:11:11] manifesting his word. But Adam sold us
[1:11:14] out.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; When Adam fell, do you know Adam never
[1:11:18] fell from being a man?
[1:11:21] He fell from the image of God.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he fell from. He forgot how
[1:11:27] to be God.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; He fell under spiritual amnesia and lost
[1:11:32] the ability to be able to do the things
[1:11:35] that a true God would be able to do.
[1:11:38] I've often looked at it through the ages
[1:11:40] and I don't have a lot of time to preach
[1:11:41] this area, but I but I think it's
[1:11:43] amazing. Amen. That that that purpose to
[1:11:46] reflect God lived in mankind. You know,
[1:11:49] it's amazing that even after that fall
[1:11:51] that man could no longer even look into
[1:11:53] the glory or the image of God.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That God had to hide himself and they
[1:11:57] they couldn't even look into his
[1:11:59] presence. But yet, you're built to
[1:12:01] indwell his presence.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; But the fall of men had so separated God
[1:12:07] from God until a man from God that he
[1:12:09] couldn't even look back into the
[1:12:11] presence of the one that he come to
[1:12:13] represent or reflect. Look at how
[1:12:15] powerful it was when Moses went up on
[1:12:17] the mountain and he went in the presence
[1:12:19] of God. That man in the divine presence
[1:12:22] come out and the people didn't even want
[1:12:25] to look at his face. He had to veil his
[1:12:28] face. They couldn't even see the
[1:12:30] reflected glory of God.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; But look at the reality of this. You
[1:12:37] were born to reflect the image of God on
[1:12:41] the earth. Even in this fallen condition
[1:12:44] through the blood of Jesus Christ, he
[1:12:46] redeemed man and the soul of man. Amen.
[1:12:50] Become a dwelling place for almighty God
[1:12:52] that he might reside in you. You know,
[1:12:55] it's amazing that you're born born and
[1:12:57] you live, but after the new birth, you
[1:13:00] can both live and die.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; You can die and live. It's it's pretty
[1:13:05] amazing. You can die in the flesh and
[1:13:06] live in the spirit.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because your spirit reflects his
[1:13:11] spirit
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; and his image, his manner of life.
[1:13:15] You're actually born to be a reflector,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; to reflect the image of God. Now watch
[1:13:22] the ambition. Watch it grow. In in
[1:13:24] Revelation 15 and3, the Bible said, "And
[1:13:27] they sung a song of Moses, the servant
[1:13:29] of God, the song of the lamb, saying,
[1:13:31] great and marvelous are thy works,
[1:13:32] almighty, just and true are thy ways,
[1:13:36] thou, King of saints."
[1:13:39] Now, do you see it? The lamb, the high
[1:13:41] priest is holding his blood atonement on
[1:13:43] the mercy seat for our sins. He's the
[1:13:46] Lord God Almighty. That is his present
[1:13:48] office. That is what he is doing now.
[1:13:52] He is pleading his blood for our sins.
[1:13:55] But one day when that lamb becomes that
[1:13:57] lion of the tribe of Judah, he will come
[1:13:59] forth in power and glory. Take his
[1:14:01] authority to reign as a king. He is
[1:14:04] coming as a king of the earth. Of
[1:14:06] course, that does not say he is not
[1:14:09] king. Now
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; see, for he is the king of saints.
[1:14:16] Now it is a spiritual kingdom. Oh
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; my goodness. That's the reason we act
[1:14:24] different from the world.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; See, our citizenship is in heaven. We
[1:14:31] reflect
[1:14:33] the spirit of the world of our rebirth.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Well, that's a refrigerator quote right
[1:14:39] there.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; We reflect the spirit of the world of
[1:14:44] our rebirth where Jesus is king.
[1:14:48] See, we come from a world where he is
[1:14:50] king. That is why our women do not dress
[1:14:54] in men's clothing
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; or cut their hair or use cosmetics or
[1:15:00] other things that the world likes so
[1:15:02] much. That is why our men don't drink
[1:15:04] and smoke and carry on in sin. Our
[1:15:07] dominion is the dominion over sin.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; And it is enforced through the power of
[1:15:13] the spirit in Christ that indwells us.
[1:15:16] Every kingdom on earth is going to be
[1:15:19] tore down, but ours is going to remain.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Right now, Jesus is king in
[1:15:27] a spiritual kingdom, which is the
[1:15:29] kingdom of your birth,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; not your natural birth, your new birth.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Now, you look around today and somebody
[1:15:35] says, "Well, brother Wayne, I don't see
[1:15:37] the kingdom of God." Do you know the
[1:15:38] Bible says that before you could see the
[1:15:41] kingdom, you've got to have a new birth?
[1:15:44] A man must be born again or he cannot
[1:15:46] see the kingdom of God. It becomes clear
[1:15:49] when Jesus says these words, "For my
[1:15:52] kingdom is not of this world. And if the
[1:15:54] kingdom were of this world, then my
[1:15:55] servants would fight that I should be
[1:15:58] delivered to the Jews, but now is my
[1:16:00] kingdom from his." The kingdom of God is
[1:16:02] not of this world. The kingdom of God is
[1:16:05] not even something visible. For the
[1:16:07] kingdom of God is not meat and drink,
[1:16:10] but it's righteousness and peace and joy
[1:16:12] in the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; People thought Jesus was coming to
[1:16:16] restore a kingdom. Now, I'm not off of
[1:16:18] my subject. They thought Jesus coming to
[1:16:20] restore a kingdom. Even his disciples
[1:16:22] thought he was setting up something.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Going to set up an organization here on
[1:16:27] the earth. He's going to he's going to
[1:16:29] start this this this this organization
[1:16:31] among the Jews and we're going to get
[1:16:32] our political power back. And they
[1:16:35] actually asked him in Acts one in his
[1:16:37] resurrection
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; they asked him and they said they come
[1:16:40] together and they asked said Lord will
[1:16:42] thou at this time restore again the
[1:16:43] kingdom of Israel. And he said unto them
[1:16:46] it is not for you to know the time of
[1:16:48] the seasons which the father hath put in
[1:16:51] his own power.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; But you shall receive power
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[1:16:58] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:17:01] in Jerusalem and Judea and in Samaria
[1:17:04] and unto the uttermost part of the
[1:17:07] earth.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is saying it was not a
[1:17:11] political kingdom he come to build.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; You see Jesus never come to build a
[1:17:18] denominational system.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; He come to build a kingdom
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; and that kingdom is a spiritual kingdom.
[1:17:26] Brother Bram said remember this. It was
[1:17:28] a spiritual kingdom he was going to
[1:17:30] build. We call it the church.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; On this rock, I will build my church and
[1:17:36] the gates of hell shall never prevail
[1:17:39] against it. It's the kingdom of God. It
[1:17:42] is invisible, but it's very powerful.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; So, I've never seen the kingdom of God.
[1:17:48] In Luke 17, he said this. It was
[1:17:50] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[1:17:52] kingdom should come. And he answered and
[1:17:54] said, "The kingdom of God cometh without
[1:17:57] observation."
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Neither could you say low here or low
[1:18:01] there. Because the kingdom of God
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; is within you.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; God's kingdom
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; where he is king
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; is right here in this building this
[1:18:22] morning. Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Do you see the great jealousy Apostle
[1:18:28] Paul had over the church?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Can you see the jealousy William
[1:18:32] Brandham had over the church
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; that it should not be manhandled because
[1:18:37] it was God's kingdom.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; It was the kingdom of God. And this
[1:18:43] kingdom is growing.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; This kingdom is not getting smaller.
[1:18:47] Back a few years ago, brother Vernon,
[1:18:49] this believe the sign people, you know,
[1:18:51] they started attacking the message and
[1:18:52] they got a couple of preachers to
[1:18:54] believe them and they got these
[1:18:55] preachers filled up with this mindset
[1:18:57] that if they got away from the message
[1:18:58] and the reproach that they feel the
[1:19:00] message brought that these guys were
[1:19:02] special gifted men and they would have
[1:19:04] worldrenowned ministries, if they just
[1:19:06] got away from this this reproachful
[1:19:08] William Brandham,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; this thing's going down. If you'll just
[1:19:12] if you'll just get away and turn against
[1:19:14] this thing, you're going to grow and
[1:19:15] your ministries are going to go. That
[1:19:17] one went from about four or 500 people
[1:19:19] down to a storefront with a couple.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Poor fella. They got theyly lied to him.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; They deceitfully lied to him. And then
[1:19:26] when they got him destroyed and they got
[1:19:28] another one destroyed and they got
[1:19:29] another one destroyed, they went around
[1:19:30] telling everybody, "Amen, the message is
[1:19:32] getting smaller. You better get out
[1:19:34] before it falls apart." Meanwhile, I'm
[1:19:36] over there in India preaching meetings
[1:19:38] of Amen. with 750, 800 people in a
[1:19:41] church. Amen. And a pastor's going to
[1:19:43] accept the message. And his
[1:19:45] denominational friend says, "If you
[1:19:46] accept that message, your your your your
[1:19:48] people's going to shrink. You're going
[1:19:50] to go to nothing." Amen. You know, amen.
[1:19:52] He he accepted the message. Amen. I
[1:19:54] preached there. 30 preachers in one
[1:19:56] meeting accepted this ministry of
[1:19:59] William Brham as a prophet of God. Went
[1:20:01] home and started building their
[1:20:02] churches. The last time I was over there
[1:20:04] preaching for him, his church had
[1:20:06] doubled. They tore all the walls out and
[1:20:08] they're looking for a building big
[1:20:10] enough to fit them because they were in
[1:20:11] the streets and they were in the
[1:20:13] buildings and they were every which way.
[1:20:15] Amen. Because Amen. This message is not
[1:20:17] smaller. This is not shrinking up. This
[1:20:21] is growing. It's growing in the heart of
[1:20:24] the believers of almighty God.
[1:20:27] Come on church. They tell they tell us,
[1:20:30] you know, well, if you quote brother
[1:20:31] Brandham, your church is going to be
[1:20:33] small. Well, amen. I don't know what you
[1:20:35] call small.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't think that God is
[1:20:40] looking for some some halfwayer. I don't
[1:20:43] believe God is looking for somebody
[1:20:44] that's not sure what they believe. And
[1:20:46] maybe we could quote brother Random.
[1:20:48] Maybe we couldn't. And I'm fearful if if
[1:20:50] somebody might hear me talk about
[1:20:51] Brother Brandom, they might not come
[1:20:52] back. Listen, if that's if that's
[1:20:54] something if you're not going to come
[1:20:55] back if I talk about William Brandom,
[1:20:57] let me save you a trip because this
[1:20:59] ministry, this platform is built on the
[1:21:02] revelation that God sent a message in
[1:21:04] this hour. And this message is preparing
[1:21:07] this church
[1:21:09] [Applause]
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; and it's growing and it's getting
[1:21:13] stronger and we're getting more.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; The only thing this all this criticism
[1:21:17] did, y'all know what it did, y'all know
[1:21:19] what it really did for us? It made us
[1:21:21] more mature.
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; And it's exactly what brother Brandham
[1:21:27] said would happen. He said the
[1:21:29] acceleration of maturity would be
[1:21:31] strengthened by that coming hot sun. And
[1:21:34] when the sun starts shining, it's the
[1:21:36] sign of the son of a messianic kingdom.
[1:21:39] This is not a church kingdom. This is
[1:21:41] not a a man's kingdom. This is the
[1:21:43] Messiah's kingdom. The kingdom of the
[1:21:46] Messiah of Almighty God. And it's
[1:21:49] established in the heart and the soul of
[1:21:51] a man by revelation.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; No wonder that devil hates revelation so
[1:21:56] bad.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Because if you get somebody a
[1:21:59] revelation, I I was quoting brother
[1:22:00] Brandham. It's established by
[1:22:02] revelation. If you get a revelation in
[1:22:04] the heart of a believer about what
[1:22:05] they're dealing with, do you know
[1:22:07] there's no persuading that believer
[1:22:09] differently? Once they see this message
[1:22:11] from their heart, you will never
[1:22:14] persuade them differently because
[1:22:16] they're established in the kingdom of
[1:22:18] God.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; This kingdom is the kingdom of almighty
[1:22:21] God. It's the kingdom Jesus prophesied
[1:22:23] and he built himself. Uh I I just I just
[1:22:27] love it because uh if you like to listen
[1:22:29] to tapes, the Messiah 1961, I just love
[1:22:31] it how brother Brandham explains this.
[1:22:33] How many How many of you been born
[1:22:35] again? How how many's got the new birth
[1:22:36] in here?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Sure. You know what I'm talking about.
[1:22:40] But you would have thought when you got
[1:22:42] born again, you would possess the whole
[1:22:44] land right then.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Now the whole land became yours.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; As an heir,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; but you know what, brother Bram explains
[1:22:53] it in in his hillbilly way. I thank God
[1:22:56] that he explained things that I could
[1:22:58] catch
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; because he said when you got saved, he
[1:23:02] says, "You don't have to die physically
[1:23:05] to get into this, but you got to die
[1:23:07] spiritually to get into this." And
[1:23:09] inside of you is where it gets its
[1:23:12] control.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And he says, see, he presses himself
[1:23:16] forward. Now, when you got when you got
[1:23:19] when you got saved, Brother Bam explains
[1:23:21] it like this. He said a light about the
[1:23:24] size of the button on your shirt
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; came into you.
[1:23:28] when that that little infant child that
[1:23:31] that young newborn child of God, brother
[1:23:35] Brandham said it had a button size light
[1:23:38] on the inside. And then he describes it.
[1:23:41] That's where he gets his control. He
[1:23:43] says, "And then he begins to press
[1:23:45] himself forward and don't you let any
[1:23:48] root of bitterness or hatred or malice
[1:23:50] that'll run him right back out again.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; But you get all your meanness out." He
[1:23:54] was talking to me right there. You get
[1:23:56] all the superstitions out. You get all
[1:23:58] the unbelief out and every time you move
[1:24:02] out a little of unbelief, God steps
[1:24:05] right there and takes it over.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? That light is in
[1:24:11] you this morning looking for a way to
[1:24:13] grow.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a place in you to
[1:24:17] possess a greater way. Amen. And all you
[1:24:20] have to do is just move something out of
[1:24:23] the way and he will take over. He told
[1:24:25] Joshua, "You could have every place that
[1:24:28] your foot would step." And I'll tell you
[1:24:30] this morning, I have an ambition that we
[1:24:32] could have everything that God has
[1:24:34] promised this church. Amen. And the only
[1:24:36] thing we got to do is move it out of the
[1:24:38] way and let his light begin to press in.
[1:24:41] Begin to press begin to press in.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Start pressing out.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Pressing out. The the Bible says it
[1:24:51] here, and I'm I'm going to skip some
[1:24:52] things, but I I want to get this point
[1:24:54] to you. The Bible says here that this
[1:24:56] kingdom that the violent is going to
[1:24:58] take it by force.
[1:25:02] that this this church is designed of God
[1:25:07] to press into his kingdom into such a
[1:25:11] way that it will be able to manifest
[1:25:14] every power that is promised them in the
[1:25:18] dimensions God has given them.
[1:25:21] Do you see this Holy Ghost that has fell
[1:25:25] is Christ himself come into the church
[1:25:28] and he has given you the keys to this
[1:25:31] kingdom and whatever you bind shall be
[1:25:34] bound and whatever you loose shall be
[1:25:36] loosed. That old devil's been telling
[1:25:39] you that this place that you need to
[1:25:41] overcome has come to stay and you're
[1:25:44] never getting past it. and you you might
[1:25:46] as well just quit fighting and you might
[1:25:48] as well lay down your weapons and you
[1:25:50] you might as well just reside that this
[1:25:53] is the way it's always going to be. But
[1:25:55] I I refute that. I resist that idea. I
[1:25:59] believe you were born as a son of God
[1:26:01] and there is a land of the stature of
[1:26:04] the perfect man that you can have all
[1:26:06] the knowledge and all the wisdom and all
[1:26:08] the temperance. Come on. I believe all
[1:26:10] you'd have to do is begin to grow and
[1:26:12] you can have every bit of it. I was just
[1:26:14] thinking this the other day. I I'm just
[1:26:16] thinking on on on on potential and
[1:26:18] maturity. And I I won't preach a sermon
[1:26:20] on it, but I I just want to say this
[1:26:22] that that you you have potentials that
[1:26:24] you don't know you have.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And the enemy has tried to lock down.
[1:26:29] That's that's that's a thing that I have
[1:26:31] that's a thing that I have contended for
[1:26:33] for years, brother Chris. People say,
[1:26:34] "Well, the third pole has nothing to do
[1:26:36] with a bride, you know, and they they
[1:26:38] don't believe that the that the spoken
[1:26:40] word could be used by an ordinary man or
[1:26:43] or some that's only for a prophet." But
[1:26:46] that's not what the Bible said. It said,
[1:26:47] "He that believeth, the works that I do
[1:26:49] shall he do also, and greater works he
[1:26:50] do, for I go unto the father." That's
[1:26:52] Bible.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; But they get that in their mind, you
[1:26:55] see. And then by doing so, they push
[1:26:57] people to be able to say, "Well, if you
[1:26:59] can't exercise it, if you can't create
[1:27:01] something, then you don't have it." But
[1:27:03] you see my contention is not everybody
[1:27:06] has to create something
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; right. But the potential to do so
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; is inside every believer.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to shoot Russia with a
[1:27:19] nuclear bomb to believe we got one.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; America's got a lot of them and they
[1:27:24] proved them over the years. But you see
[1:27:26] those things have to be operated. This
[1:27:29] is not just something that you play with
[1:27:31] to prove to somebody you got. But there
[1:27:33] is a potential in this church. There's a
[1:27:36] potential in every believer. And I'll
[1:27:38] tell you, your greatest potential, the
[1:27:40] capping of the potential of a believer
[1:27:43] is divine love.
[1:27:45] [Music]
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; I thought of it. I look at the oak tree,
[1:27:48] the mighty oak, and I look at him and I
[1:27:50] say, "Where does he mature?"
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And you see that there's a time where he
[1:27:55] almost stops growing in height.
[1:27:58] He'll he'll get a little bigger around
[1:28:00] in the middle,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; but he almost stops growing in height
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; because he's reached a level
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; of the potential of that tree.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; And God designed you
[1:28:17] that divine love is that place we're
[1:28:21] growing to. Yeah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And to believe this to believe this that
[1:28:25] you are built in such a way, Ben, that
[1:28:29] you can reflect the exact image of God
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; in every situation of your life.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, you talk about powerful.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; You talk about a kingdom.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; A kingdom where you and his word become
[1:28:47] one. It's one thing to reflect them
[1:28:50] when we're dancing, and I love dancing,
[1:28:52] so don't don't get off on that. And it's
[1:28:55] one thing to reflect them when we're in
[1:28:57] the high and the emotions of of the
[1:29:00] things,
[1:29:03] but what about when it requires
[1:29:07] dying to something to love somebody?
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; What about that? What What about when it
[1:29:13] requires
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Father, forgive them.
[1:29:19] They don't know what they do.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; You want to talk about conquering?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Conquering ourselves.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Conquering ourselves as the children of
[1:29:32] this great kingdom.
[1:29:35] He wants you united under a spiritual
[1:29:39] kingdom
[1:29:41] that he is the king of.
[1:29:45] It would be normal for us to say,
[1:29:49] "By the way, what are we overcoming?"
[1:29:53] But the prophet of God in Revelation
[1:29:55] chapter 3 said, "To him that overcometh
[1:29:57] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:29:59] as I've also overcame and sat down with
[1:30:01] my father in his o throne."
[1:30:04] Now, what are we to overcome? That would
[1:30:06] be the normal question. But that is not
[1:30:09] the actual thought of this verse. It is
[1:30:11] not what we are to overcome, but it's
[1:30:15] how
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; we are to overcome.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet with me
[1:30:20] this morning?
[1:30:25] To overcome, as our musicians would
[1:30:27] come, to overcome is to stand
[1:30:31] to stand the test.
[1:30:34] See, every son that comes to God
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; must be tried.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; There will be no exceptions to that
[1:30:42] rule.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; So when you give if you give your life
[1:30:46] to Christ and things hit you that's
[1:30:48] never hit you before.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't tell don't say we didn't
[1:30:53] tell you.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We're not we're not lying to you. We're
[1:30:59] not trying to say that this is a flowery
[1:31:01] bed of ease and you could come become a
[1:31:02] Christian. And you're not going to have,
[1:31:04] of course, you're going to have a battle
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; cuz your testimony is fing to wage war
[1:31:08] on hell.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; The change that's about to happen in
[1:31:11] you, Satan is is is pulled out all stops
[1:31:14] to stop that before it takes place.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; But there has to be there has to be a
[1:31:18] test before there's an overcomer.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; This final age of overcomers have been
[1:31:25] anointed to share the throne of almighty
[1:31:28] God.
[1:31:30] It's it's an amazing story.
[1:31:33] And I'll preach it later, but in Matthew
[1:31:36] 20, a woman comes to Jesus and she got
[1:31:39] two sons and she says to him,"Lord,
[1:31:42] can my sons sit on your left hand and
[1:31:45] your right hand?" And Jesus said to
[1:31:48] them,
[1:31:49] that's a mother's prayer. They're
[1:31:51] powerful.
[1:31:52] Said, "Well, they can drink of the cup I
[1:31:54] drink of. They could take the baptism
[1:31:56] that I have,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; but to set on my left and right hand is
[1:32:00] not mine to give.
[1:32:03] But it is for those that have been
[1:32:04] prepared of my father.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "Do you see that?
[1:32:10] That's the overcomer of that leadya.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It was in existence.
[1:32:15] She wanted it, but it wouldn't be given
[1:32:18] to anybody but the overcomer of that
[1:32:21] leodysian age.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; That's why that predestination's over
[1:32:26] your life to be conformed. It's because
[1:32:28] God has already given you a seat
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; and you're headed toward it.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; So, if you're sitting here this morning,
[1:32:35] you're saying, "Brother Wayne, I'm I'm
[1:32:36] I'm I'm I'm going through I'm going
[1:32:39] through some of the greatest struggles
[1:32:41] and and maybe maybe some of them are
[1:32:42] have been long lasting.
[1:32:45] Just recently, we're dealing with
[1:32:46] situations. People said, "Well, brother
[1:32:48] Wayne, I've been dealing with this for,
[1:32:49] you know, maybe five years. I've been
[1:32:50] dealing this for 10 years." And and all
[1:32:52] of a sudden, but but all of a sudden,
[1:32:54] you're dealing with it. See,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; it's because the grace of God won't let
[1:32:58] it go no further.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; He's brought you to that place. And and
[1:33:04] and it's easy to say it's easy to say,
[1:33:06] "Lord, just just just take me home."
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; He will as an overcomer.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; But you got something to do this
[1:33:19] morning,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and that's overcome.
[1:33:24] You got to you got to be setting sin.
[1:33:26] You got a something happening in your
[1:33:28] life that you've been struggling and
[1:33:29] that thing is lied to you.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Well, see there, you never
[1:33:33] even got saved or you wouldn't be
[1:33:35] struggling against it." The prophet said
[1:33:39] when they came to the land of Canaan,
[1:33:42] there was Amalachites in it.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible is clear that there were
[1:33:46] giants in that land,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; but there was honey, too. That's right.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; But before they could eat honey, they
[1:33:52] had to kill some giants. So, it's not
[1:33:54] that you're not in the right land or
[1:33:56] that you didn't have the right birth or
[1:33:58] the right experience,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; but there's things God left there
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; for you
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; for you to overcome.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to do as a as a
[1:34:11] as a man before I'm your pastor, before
[1:34:14] I'm a preacher.
[1:34:17] I want to be a Christian.
[1:34:19] I want to be a Christian in my life. I
[1:34:21] want to live.
[1:34:24] I want the kingdom of God to reflect
[1:34:26] through my life.
[1:34:29] I'm holding a resistance against Satan's
[1:34:32] Eden.
[1:34:36] My king is king, but he's rejected.
[1:34:43] That's right. The rejected king and his
[1:34:46] people. But one day
[1:34:49] he's coming back in power.
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Carrie, I'll never have to
[1:34:55] switch kings
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; cuz my king will rule
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; throughout eternity. Brother Ben, you
[1:35:02] have something.
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Something keeps holding
[1:35:13] me.
[1:35:17] Every day I see
[1:35:24] he's helping me faithfully
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:29] to overcome
[1:35:33] my trials.
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:39] Guiding me constantly,
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:46] giving me victory.
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:54] He's a reality
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:58] cuz something keeps holding
[1:36:02] me.
[1:36:07] Oh, something keeps holding
[1:36:11] me.
[1:36:12] [Music]
[1:36:15] Every day I see
[1:36:22] he's helping me faithfully
[1:36:27] to overcome
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:30] my trials.
[1:36:36] Guiding me constantly
[1:36:43] giving me victory.
[1:36:50] He's a reality

[1:36:58] me.
