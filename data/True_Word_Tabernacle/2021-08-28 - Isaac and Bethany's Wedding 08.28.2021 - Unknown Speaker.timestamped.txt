[38:07] away
[38:10] too much to carry nothing left to say

[38:19] [Music]
[38:29] and all these years
[38:37] [Music]
[38:41] and beauty grows
[38:44] [Music]
[38:47] full of gladness in the times of pain

[39:36] it's your grace
[39:51] god bless you
[39:56] bethany brother isaac thank you for
[39:58] having me
[40:00] to be a part of this incredibly special
[40:02] occasion
[40:06] today we have a wedding of royalty
[40:10] the world may not recognize it but
[40:13] royalty is
[40:14] of two families
[40:16] both families
[40:18] of royalty
[40:21] we step out of eternity to into a space
[40:23] of time
[40:25] we're pre-planned before the foundation
[40:27] of the world
[40:29] our names are written in the lamb's book
[40:31] of life
[40:33] today one of the photos
[40:36] of the lamb's book is standing before us
[40:41] i would just like to say this to you
[40:44] that eternity
[40:46] and time has came to a pause today
[40:51] and not only do we have an incredibly
[40:54] distinguished guest
[40:55] all around this building
[40:57] and people watching throughout the
[40:59] internet
[41:00] but angels are standing watching
[41:03] for the attributes of god's mind
[41:06] are on display
[41:08] from one family gathered from this
[41:10] source and another from this source
[41:15] and god is in control of this whole
[41:17] situation
[41:21] no doubt there was a time that
[41:23] you just passed by and she was just
[41:25] another girl
[41:34] but there was a day
[41:36] that something clicked
[41:41] and you couldn't think of nothing else
[41:44] but her
[41:47] do do i want to live i'm not going to
[41:49] address her in that way
[41:55] this is a union that god has built
[42:01] he pre-planned it
[42:04] we can't remember standing in eternity
[42:08] but we're standing here in time
[42:11] time has
[42:13] elements to where that it's great joys
[42:15] and
[42:16] deep sorrows
[42:18] but god knew that man should not be
[42:20] alone
[42:22] you see just as much as he gifted you
[42:25] to follow in the lineage of your family
[42:28] to be a minister
[42:31] god will ordain you
[42:33] to carry his word and it's the greatest
[42:35] thing
[42:37] that any person could ever have
[42:39] greater than the president of the united
[42:41] states of america
[42:43] but he designed it that you wouldn't do
[42:44] that alone
[42:46] but today is a reflection of what god
[42:49] did
[42:50] in the garden of eden
[42:52] it was there that god created his own
[42:55] image
[42:56] his son
[42:57] from spirit form to flesh form
[43:00] but he didn't want him to be alone
[43:03] so he performed an operation on him and
[43:06] took out of his side
[43:09] and what a wedding that it was
[43:12] under the canopy of the garden of eden
[43:15] those two
[43:17] when his eyes fell on her
[43:19] it was kind of like what happened with
[43:21] your eyes just a few moments ago
[43:24] you didn't see 400 guests but the most
[43:27] important one in the room stepped out
[43:32] may that never
[43:33] leave your life
[43:36] now jesus
[43:38] had placed that in adam to be lonely
[43:41] because he desired a wife
[43:45] so he had prophets to come
[43:47] and talk about how it would be
[43:50] even isaac and rebecca to be a perfect
[43:53] portrayal
[43:54] of that to take place
[43:58] but
[43:59] prophets couldn't bring that as a
[44:01] manifestation
[44:03] and they couldn't redeem no one
[44:05] not even
[44:06] themselves so jesus left the our palaces
[44:10] of glory
[44:11] and took upon himself the form of a man
[44:15] he walked and he talked
[44:17] well he thought so much of the weddings
[44:20] until his first miracle would be
[44:22] performed at a wedding
[44:25] and it was a not by just a spoken word
[44:28] but it was creativity
[44:31] he turned water
[44:32] into one
[44:34] now he's here today
[44:36] to take two people and make them one
[44:40] as you
[44:41] go and your marriage will be blessed
[44:44] children will come
[44:46] whether you know that or not but the
[44:49] time of their manifestation will come on
[44:52] the earth
[44:55] and god has designed that in his mind
[44:58] how that a minister
[45:00] up here in lime ohio
[45:03] and his family
[45:05] and then in the predestination
[45:08] he brings a guy named wayne lawson
[45:11] to come and be a blessing to this
[45:12] audience
[45:14] and he brings an arkansas girl here
[45:18] he knows how to move his seed
[45:21] from one state to another
[45:24] and maybe in our mind's eye we cannot
[45:26] figure out god what are you doing
[45:30] but he says i've got to have these two
[45:31] kids to get married
[45:33] and no doubt the angels are standing
[45:35] watching and they've been watching all
[45:37] the time and kind of helping in the in
[45:40] the line of duty but they've been
[45:41] watching all of this to come to pass
[45:44] and so today
[45:47] jesus is not stirring the water to make
[45:49] it whine
[45:51] he's stirring the very spirit of god
[45:54] because every couple in this room
[45:57] renews their vows and realizes that
[46:01] marriage is so incredibly important
[46:04] i would just remind you today
[46:12] that every day is important amen
[46:16] never take for granted
[46:19] one day
[46:21] because this life is so short
[46:24] and we don't know what day that our lord
[46:27] jesus will call us home
[46:29] so you make sure
[46:32] to not let one day go by
[46:36] without you spending time with
[46:38] yourselves
[46:39] and with our lord jesus now remember
[46:42] this
[46:44] he wants to be the unseen guest
[46:47] in your home
[46:49] he wants to be there in every
[46:51] conversation
[46:53] and he's always near
[46:56] great times
[46:58] bad times
[46:59] difficult times
[47:01] physical troubles
[47:03] financial issues
[47:05] great decisions that have to be made
[47:08] choices of life that you'll have to make
[47:11] he's always the head of our homes
[47:15] you're a real man you're a prince of a
[47:17] family
[47:18] your family has done an incredible job
[47:21] of raising you to be a real man
[47:25] you're the description of what this
[47:27] message is
[47:29] you're that description
[47:31] what is the message
[47:33] you are that
[47:35] you're the description of what all of
[47:37] the sermons and
[47:38] all of the incredible services are about
[47:42] you are a great compliment to your
[47:44] grandfather's ministry
[47:49] gifts came through your family
[47:54] and they've come from one generation to
[47:56] another
[47:58] now you can't preach
[48:02] but god has gifted you
[48:04] above many others
[48:06] to be anointed to write songs
[48:09] and to sing them
[48:11] now your atmosphere when you strum a
[48:14] guitar and you begin to sing
[48:17] it actually changes the environment of
[48:19] the entire room
[48:21] amen why demons run for cover
[48:25] because of god's place to gift in your
[48:27] life
[48:29] not to speak like your dad
[48:31] but to sing
[48:33] whether you know this or not i bring
[48:35] this up
[48:36] because
[48:38] that your gifts will now be elevated
[48:41] because you've become one
[48:45] your sermons will have more depth
[48:47] they'll have greater understanding
[48:50] because there's
[48:52] your greatest fan will sit in the room
[48:54] and she will be praying for you
[48:57] like no other minister
[49:01] your songs will have incredible meaning
[49:09] and they will be inspired from another
[49:11] realm
[49:13] and god has so blessed you
[49:16] brother branham stands and
[49:18] speaks choosing of a bride
[49:21] and he says a man will choose a woman
[49:24] that reflects his own character
[49:27] now we really couldn't see the inside of
[49:30] you
[49:31] until today
[49:36] and i would say the inside of you looks
[49:38] real well
[49:56] hey god is the author of love
[50:00] amen
[50:02] it is him that brings us together
[50:06] it is love that will carry us through
[50:09] the most difficult storms
[50:12] love
[50:14] conquers all
[50:16] it conquers every demon
[50:19] it conquers every power
[50:21] it is the greatest force on the face of
[50:24] the earth is love
[50:27] in saying that
[50:29] let nothing
[50:31] come between
[50:32] you two
[50:34] and if it does recognize it is a spirit
[50:38] from another realm
[50:40] and ask the lord jesus to take that away
[50:46] my greatest
[50:47] admonition to you today is
[50:50] the word
[50:52] forgive is a powerful word
[50:56] i just want to say this to you adam
[50:58] isaac
[51:01] jesus god preached adam's wedding
[51:06] i want to say this to you isaac remember
[51:09] this day
[51:11] mark this day on your calendar
[51:13] oh sure it's your anniversary
[51:16] but this is the last day you'll be right
[51:36] there was about 200 amens in this
[51:38] building
[51:40] all from the sisters
[51:46] the word of god tells us that love is
[51:48] like
[51:50] if i speak
[51:51] of tongues of men and angels
[51:54] but have not love
[51:56] i'm only a resounding
[51:58] brass and a
[52:00] sounding symbol
[52:01] if for the gift of prophecy i can fathom
[52:04] all mysteries and knowledge
[52:06] and if i have
[52:07] faith to possess
[52:10] all things my body is a could be given
[52:13] to the flames
[52:15] but if i have not love
[52:18] i have nothing
[52:22] love is patient
[52:25] love is kind
[52:27] it does not envy
[52:30] it is not proud
[52:33] it is not rude
[52:35] it is not self-seeking
[52:38] it is not easily angered
[52:41] it keeps no record of wrongs
[52:44] if you hear nothing else today
[52:47] it keeps no record of wrongs
[52:51] love does not delight in evil
[52:54] but rejoices with truth
[52:57] it always protects
[53:00] it always trusts
[53:03] it always hopes
[53:05] and it always preserves
[53:09] today
[53:11] is an image
[53:13] of when god brings us home
[53:15] amen
[53:16] all the angels of god will stand
[53:20] and they'll look at us as we walk in to
[53:22] our new bodies
[53:24] and walk into that celestial place
[53:28] as a husband and wife arm in arm
[53:31] walking into the kingdom of god singing
[53:33] amazing grace how sweet the sound that
[53:36] saved the wretch like me
[53:38] and all the angels will watch
[53:41] and they will go
[53:43] this
[53:44] is what that was about
[53:47] i say god bless you to you both
[53:50] i love you with all of my hearts you
[53:53] take good care of her
[53:55] if you don't she's going to call me
