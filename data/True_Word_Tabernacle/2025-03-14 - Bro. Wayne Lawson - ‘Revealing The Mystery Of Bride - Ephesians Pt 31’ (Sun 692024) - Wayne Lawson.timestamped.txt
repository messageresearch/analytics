[5:59] certainly thank the Lord this morning
[6:01] for the rewards of his conquering amen
[6:03] for his grace and I wonder if we could
[6:05] just take a moment and and go to the
[6:07] Lord in a word of prayer we certainly
[6:09] had tremendous meetings last weekend
[6:12] amen and such a blessing amen but just
[6:15] as we bow our hearts today I wonder
[6:17] maybe you might just take somebody by

[6:21] together as a family as a church and if
[6:23] there's a need here this morning maybe
[6:25] someone sitting beside you amen the Holy
[6:28] Spirit would move move upon them Father
[6:31] we bow our hearts this morning knowing
[6:34] Lord that
[6:35] there without your word there would be
[6:38] no one here today there would be no one
[6:41] worthy Lord to stand under your great
[6:45] grace but because of what you have done
[6:48] Lord because of the mercy that you have
[6:51] shown Lord Lord how you were doing
[6:54] things long before we were even here
[6:57] Lord how you were preparing lives and
[6:59] hearts and grandfathers and positions
[7:02] and Lord how you set men in order and
[7:06] how you arrange things Lord for this
[7:08] very moment that we would stand here
[7:10] this day under this roof Lord with one
[7:13] another believing father of your grace

[7:26] gathered here under this roof today
[7:28] father as we We join together as your

[8:28] ask it in the name name of the Lord
[8:30] Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen we
[8:35] certainly love you and God bless you if
[8:37] you have your Bibles today we would like
[8:39] to go right into the word of the Lord in
[8:41] the book of Ephesians the 5th chapter
[8:44] amen we're going to be going I would
[8:46] like to just read these uh few verses
[8:49] again of Ephesians
[8:51] 5:22 down to 32 amen
[8:56] um it's a tremendous area of the script
[8:59] scripture we have been in
[9:02] Ephesians uh for a little bit of time
[9:04] and this fifth chapter has got my
[9:06] attention right now so you bear with me
[9:09] uh wives submit yourselves unto your own
[9:12] husbands as unto the Lord now for the
[9:15] husband is the head of the wife even as
[9:19] Christ is the head of the
[9:22] church and he is the savior of the body
[9:26] now therefore as the church is subject
[9:28] unto Christ Christ so let wives be to
[9:32] their own husbands in everything
[9:35] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[9:39] also loved the church and gave himself
[9:42] for it that he might sanctify and
[9:44] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[9:47] by the word that he might present it to
[9:49] himself a glorious church not having
[9:52] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[9:54] that it should be holy and without
[9:57] blemish now so ought men to love their
[10:00] wives even as their own bodies now he
[10:03] that loveth his wife loveth himself for
[10:07] no man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[10:10] nourished and cherished it even as the
[10:13] Lord the church now we are members of
[10:16] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[10:19] and for this cause shall a man leave his
[10:22] father and mother and be joined unto his
[10:25] wife and they too shall be one flesh
[10:29] now this is a great
[10:32] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[10:37] and the church may God bless the reading
[10:39] as you could be seated this morning and
[10:42] this is a great mystery but I speak
[10:45] concerning Christ and the church amen uh
[10:48] I want to speak to you if I take a
[10:50] subject this morning I want to talk to
[10:52] you about revealing the mystery of bride
[10:55] revealing the mystery of Bride and and
[10:58] when I when I say that I I I think of
[11:01] here where Paul says but I speak
[11:03] concerning Christ and the church amen
[11:06] being Church being his body and and I'm
[11:09] I'm going to uh use this as a marriage
[11:11] of course bridegroom and bride so we
[11:14] want to talk about the bride part of
[11:17] this um when I when I say this of course
[11:20] Paul it's amazing because Paul is the
[11:22] one who is introducing marriage to the
[11:25] Gentiles he he's bringing the Covenant
[11:27] of marriage to the Gentile church and
[11:30] it's in the book of Ephesians where he's
[11:32] doing it which of course Ephesians is
[11:34] the book of placing and he's placing the
[11:37] Gentile Church in the idea of marriage
[11:39] until this time of course Gentiles
[11:42] didn't have probably a good concept of
[11:44] marriage but they do it this time amen
[11:46] and he's trying to bring the position to
[11:49] them now I I I think it's powerful as
[11:51] he's going to reveal to them what church
[11:54] means what what it means to be a part of
[11:56] the body is speaking about being a part
[11:59] of the Bride now we are living in the
[12:01] season that I do believe that the
[12:04] marriage of the Lamb has come I I
[12:07] believe that that is the season that
[12:09] we're living in uh when I say that of
[12:11] course if you go to Romans the 7th
[12:13] chapter and you see that Paul says that
[12:15] a woman is bound to her first husband as
[12:17] long as he lives but he said that but
[12:18] when he would die she was free to marry
[12:21] another now now brother bandam takes
[12:23] that and he said now you might think
[12:25] amen that that's about marriage and
[12:27] divorce he said but it's actually a
[12:29] prophecy written for the end time which
[12:32] speaks of the marriage of the Lamb it's
[12:34] speaking of that the denominational
[12:35] church had held the church and the bride
[12:38] in it in its the denomination had held
[12:41] it and as long as the denomination lived
[12:43] she was not free to marry but God let
[12:46] the thing die that she would be free to
[12:48] marry so the what's going on today is an
[12:52] event that is made clear by the prophecy
[12:55] of
[12:56] scriptures modern events are made clear
[12:59] prophecy what is all of this about it's
[13:01] about the marriage of the Lamb what's
[13:03] the message of the hour about it's about
[13:06] God taking himself a bride what is it
[13:09] the ministry of brother brandham what is
[13:11] all of this about why all the Tod do
[13:13] what's it what is it it's the great
[13:15] marriage of the Bride you know when
[13:17] royalty gets married big things happen
[13:19] you know they spend uh uh when a king
[13:22] takes a bride or a princess or you
[13:24] remember England they had that marriage
[13:26] a few years ago and Princess Kate
[13:28] married William and I I was actually up
[13:30] in uh Canada when it happened Chris and
[13:32] I were up there with at Saskatoon with
[13:35] brother men those guys and that's all
[13:37] anybody talked about was that wedding
[13:39] they were talking about it over people
[13:40] were staying up half the night and
[13:42] there's no telling the millions and
[13:44] millions and millions of dollars that
[13:46] was spent on on dresses and and and uh
[13:50] security and big cars and man goodness
[13:53] you I mean but it was a marriage it was
[13:55] going on and that's what it was all
[13:57] about now when we look at hour that
[13:59] we're living somebody said well that's a
[14:01] whole lot going on just about a marriage
[14:03] but you're talking about the marriage of
[14:05] the Lamb you're talking about the king
[14:08] of heaven and you're talking about the
[14:10] Queen of Heaven your marriage is a big
[14:12] deal amen this is a big thing and God
[14:16] has gave a marriage to the lamb and the
[14:18] Bible says in Revelations 19 of course
[14:21] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[14:23] honor to him for the marriage of the
[14:25] Lamb has come and his wife hath made
[14:28] herself rich ready and to her was
[14:30] granted that she would be arrayed in
[14:32] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[14:34] linen is the righteousness of the Saints
[14:37] so what she's going to wear amen is
[14:39] going to be amen a grant from him in
[14:42] other words he has prepared her wedding
[14:44] clothes and we know of course that is
[14:46] what the third poll was about was to
[14:48] dress the bride for this marriage and
[14:50] and we see then that this was this was
[14:53] the announcement of the age that there
[14:55] would be now the last time we spoke to
[14:57] you on this it was the marriage of the
[14:58] Lamb I'm going to rehearse just a moment
[15:00] and then continue amen that we have seen
[15:03] that this is the announcement of the age
[15:05] this is the what the Thunders have
[15:07] thundered it they brought a voice out of
[15:09] the throne and they they brought forth
[15:12] the wedding they brought forth the
[15:13] promises of the marriage of course in
[15:16] the Jewish wedding amen the moving from
[15:18] betrothal to wife actually happens under
[15:22] the receiving of the marriage covenant
[15:25] and we recognize that in this age we
[15:27] have had the opening of the Seven Seals
[15:30] amen which was the marriage certificate
[15:32] to the bride it was the Lamb's Book of
[15:34] Life it was the opening of the word it's
[15:37] always been amazing to me that when
[15:39] brother bam comes to dedicate the temple
[15:41] or the Tabernacle there in
[15:43] 1962 he's right there as he's coming to
[15:45] dedicate it he does it in the opening of
[15:47] the seals under goddess in Simplicity
[15:50] and they have uh they have changed the
[15:52] the they have changed the Tabernacle and
[15:54] they moved it from two sections to three
[15:57] which was I thought was very good
[15:59] and then when they when they bring it
[16:01] out brother Bram comes out and he says
[16:02] now I'm a little late getting out to
[16:03] preach this morning he said because I
[16:05] did something in the back room and he
[16:08] had actually married a couple in the
[16:11] back room before he came out to preach
[16:14] there he said now it's real symbolic to
[16:16] what we're about to do here amen that
[16:19] there was a marriage in the back room if
[16:20] you know brother Josiah Scott some of
[16:22] you do his daughter comes here a lot but
[16:24] brother Josiah that was his wife
[16:26] Debbie's uncle that was married back
[16:28] then there in the back I think their
[16:29] name is p
[16:31] pagi yeah I can't get the name exactly
[16:34] what is it it's they're from Arizon it's
[16:37] baji I believe y'all know him huhi Bazi
[16:42] I can't get the name right forgive me
[16:44] amen I just butchered them poor people's
[16:46] names amen but the but the prophet said
[16:49] he had came out for the for for for from
[16:52] it and he said uh if you ask him Josiah
[16:54] said I ask him and he said brother
[16:56] brandom had asked him do you want to be
[16:58] married out in front of the church I'll
[17:01] perform the wedding right out in the
[17:02] church he said or I'll perform it in the
[17:04] back room in this office and they said
[17:07] no brother random we'd rather have a
[17:08] private wedding and he said you you have
[17:10] made the right choice amen because see
[17:14] that third pool was never going to be a
[17:16] public show it was going to be a private
[17:18] thing and what was happening was
[17:20] happening in private amen the world just
[17:23] thought it was a preacher preaching they
[17:25] thought it was just seals opening amen
[17:27] but it was the word word of God coming
[17:30] to make the promise that the bride
[17:32] received it amen and we recognize the
[17:34] prophecy of the hour that's why a
[17:37] prophet would it would entitle the time
[17:39] that we're living he would call it the
[17:41] bright age of course it's the marriage
[17:43] of the Lamb that's what we're talking
[17:44] about this is the season that when the
[17:47] headship of the word would become one
[17:49] with the body it would be receive the
[17:52] message of the hour this would be the
[17:54] time amen that the prophet in the seal
[17:56] book in the first seal he said I'm going
[17:59] to call you bride he began to really
[18:01] differ between church and bride telling
[18:04] you the church amen natural was going to
[18:07] go through the tribulation that the
[18:10] church natural was like the five foolish
[18:12] virgin but he was telling you there's
[18:14] another group there's a wise virgin that
[18:16] have heard the call come out to meet him
[18:19] amen they had went into the marriage
[18:22] amen and we find out in this age of
[18:24] course that this Malachi 4 this ministry
[18:27] this William bradam the world over talks
[18:30] about him now to them he's William
[18:32] bradam but to us he's
[18:35] Elijah to them he's just William brandom
[18:38] to us he was an elaser that brought us
[18:40] to our Isaac Amen to us we know he was
[18:44] coming to choose a part of that Brad
[18:46] relation amen I'd love to know to this
[18:49] morning that we have been chosen by
[18:51] God's provided way Amen to be a bride
[18:54] now there's come churches and churches
[18:57] but there's just got to be one bride and
[19:00] that bride will be made up not just of
[19:02] mechanics only but also of Dynamics now
[19:06] Isaac found this bride in the evening
[19:09] light and we find that this bride will
[19:12] be found by elaser in the evening light
[19:16] this message will'll find the church in
[19:18] evening light it's when the evening
[19:20] Light Came amen you must you could have
[19:22] been uh uh been anybody you was anywhere
[19:25] doing anything but when the evening
[19:27] Light Came you found found out in that
[19:29] light that you are the Bride of Jesus
[19:32] Christ there was not another message
[19:34] could reveal that to you maybe you were
[19:37] Baptist or you were a part of some uh H
[19:39] H church somewhere some church natural
[19:41] and and thank God for all of the
[19:43] Christian churches we appreciate the
[19:45] Lord for them we're not we're not anti-
[19:47] uh churches and people of at all but yet
[19:50] some things cannot be revealed under
[19:53] certain light amen but under the evening
[19:56] light would be a revelation that would
[19:58] bring a marriage to you to Christ
[20:01] himself amen if we every every one of
[20:04] these marriages has to have a
[20:05] certificate and brother bam said the
[20:07] Lamb's Book of Life was your marriage
[20:09] certificate he said the unmar grace of
[20:12] God was the wedding band that you were
[20:15] you were predestinated so we found amen
[20:18] that we are already married amen this
[20:21] bride is not getting married she's
[20:23] already married amen so it's time to
[20:26] recognize the relationship that you have
[20:28] with him so as you can approach him not
[20:32] as a boyfriend not as a flirter not as
[20:34] somebody that you just met but this is
[20:37] your husband and and your checkbook is
[20:39] his checkbook amen and and you know I I
[20:42] found that in the marriage of the Jewish
[20:44] wedding they they actually Yom Kapur of
[20:47] course is the day of atonement we all
[20:50] recognize that and it happens every year
[20:52] for Israel under the blood of bulls and
[20:54] goats and it was a time of resetting of
[20:57] doing away with sins and a and a casting
[20:59] away and remembering the atonement and
[21:02] of course it happens for a nation but
[21:04] when the marriage takes place I was
[21:06] reading some articles on it and they say
[21:08] that there was a personal yum kapore
[21:11] takes place every time a woman gets
[21:13] married amen and what it is is it's when
[21:15] she has done away with her own
[21:17] reputation and her own name and she
[21:20] takes a new name and she takes a new
[21:22] reputation and that's exactly what's
[21:24] happened to the church in this hour we
[21:27] have lost our reput
[21:29] and we have took his amen I know a lot
[21:31] of people didn't want nothing to do with
[21:33] the message of the hour amen but when we
[21:36] saw amen an opportunity to say something
[21:39] good about it to to preach about it to
[21:42] to bless the name of the Lord you know
[21:44] what happened just like that little
[21:46] woman that that was in the Bible that
[21:48] saw Jesus in the house of Simon and he
[21:51] wasn't being worshiped and remember His
[21:53] Feet was dirty and he sat there in the
[21:55] corner and she saw an opportunity to get
[21:58] to the feet of Jesus and when she did
[22:01] she poured upon him the anointing oil
[22:03] and she washed his feet amen you know
[22:06] what she did she took his reputation on
[22:10] her amen I tell you what that's a good
[22:13] reputation to carry he took her
[22:15] reputation and she took his he said to
[22:18] her go and sin no more he took her
[22:21] reputation away from her but when she
[22:23] left her she had the reputation and
[22:26] every time the gospel is preached
[22:28] everywhere the gospel is preached this
[22:30] woman had to be mentioned because her
[22:33] name is mentioned with his name because
[22:35] now she carries his reputation and I
[22:38] thank God that every time the message of
[22:40] this hour is preached it has to
[22:42] recognize there is a people on the Earth
[22:45] today that believe this message they
[22:47] believe the word of God Amen and when
[22:49] you preach about William Brandon you
[22:51] preach about the end time message I know
[22:53] we have a reputation but it's his
[22:55] reputation and I believe that's a
[22:57] reputation carry in this hour a
[23:00] reputation of being the Bride of course
[23:03] Paul of course Paul is going to
[23:05] introduce us amen as the mystery of the
[23:08] Bride going all the way back to Genesis
[23:10] the 2 chapter amen the Bible tells us
[23:13] amen that this is where God brought Adam
[23:16] and Eve together but where did he get
[23:19] Eve out of
[23:21] Adam and you said brother Wayne where
[23:23] are we going to get a bride today we're
[23:25] going to get it out of
[23:27] Christ and you you see where Adam came
[23:30] from out of him came a Eve and so is it
[23:34] today you said brother Wayne where you
[23:35] going to get a bride out of it's got to
[23:37] come out of the same word that spoke of
[23:40] him is the same word that speaks of you
[23:42] and me you've got to get her out of the
[23:45] word you've got to bring her out of the
[23:47] word if she's brought out of
[23:49] denomination she ain't the right one if
[23:51] you bring her out of your ideas or
[23:53] opinion she's not the right one but this
[23:56] will be a word bride who comes from the
[23:59] scripture that's exactly what is upon
[24:02] her in this age you have been brought to
[24:06] Christ just like Eve was brought to Adam
[24:09] amen there is a bride being brought to
[24:11] Christ in this age amen now God uses the
[24:14] position of bride to describe his
[24:17] relationship with the
[24:19] church I'm glad to know that he views us
[24:21] the way we view him if he views us as
[24:25] bride amen then we view him as
[24:27] bridegroom but we also realize his view
[24:30] of us is that kind of relationship and
[24:34] we find out now the scripture tells us
[24:36] if we're going to have that position
[24:39] then we're going to take his name
[24:41] according to scripture amen she takes
[24:44] his
[24:45] name I know we're living in an age amen
[24:48] when women are keeping their own names
[24:50] you know and and they get married and
[24:52] and they keep their own names they keep
[24:54] their own identities they keep all that
[24:56] but that's not a scriptural marriage at
[24:58] all
[24:58] right that's a lean marriage you see
[25:02] they want to be married but they don't
[25:03] want to change names they want to be
[25:06] married but they don't want to change
[25:07] bank accounts you know may maybe
[25:09] sometimes women have more money than men
[25:11] these days I don't know amen but you in
[25:13] the case of Christ amen it's not so at
[25:16] all amen amen he has everything we need
[25:20] and our name is being changed to his now
[25:23] when you start looking into something
[25:25] you say well that's a bride well there's
[25:28] got to be symbology and prophecy if it's
[25:31] going to have an identification it has
[25:34] to have scriptural identification now if
[25:36] you go to the book of Acts the 15th
[25:38] chapter when the gospel became unto the
[25:41] Gentiles in Acts the 15th chapter the
[25:43] 12th verse uh down to the 18th that you
[25:47] could just read here that there was a
[25:49] great happening when Jesus had been on
[25:51] the earth he had told his disciples and
[25:54] he gave them power but he had said now
[25:56] don't go unto the Gentiles but stay here
[25:59] with the house of Israel but in Mark 16
[26:03] Jesus told them to go unto the whole
[26:06] world and preach the gospel so he
[26:08] changed from being a Jewish religion to
[26:12] being a gospel that would be for all of
[26:15] the Seed of Abraham now there was some
[26:18] of the disciples that were there who
[26:20] were used to working with Jews only and
[26:22] when they begin to see Miracles done
[26:24] among the Gentiles it was very troubling
[26:26] to them in Acts 15th chapter we find out
[26:30] this that the the Bible says in the 12th
[26:32] verse that the multitude kept silence
[26:34] and gave audience to Paul and Barnabas
[26:36] and declaring Miracles and wonders that
[26:38] God had wrought among the Gentiles by
[26:40] them and after they had after they had
[26:42] held their peace Jame answered saying
[26:44] men and Brethren hearken unto me and and
[26:48] I want you to notice who says this and
[26:50] James answered saying men and Brethren
[26:53] hearken unto me Simon hath declared how
[26:56] God did first visit the Gentiles to take
[26:59] them out a people for his name and to
[27:03] agree with the words of the prophets as
[27:06] it is written so Simon is saying that
[27:08] God would take a people out for the
[27:10] Gentiles of the Gentiles and now James
[27:13] is saying it is written in the scripture
[27:17] that after this will I return and build
[27:19] again the Tabernacle of David which is
[27:21] fallen down and I will begin build again
[27:23] the ruins thereof and I will set it up
[27:27] that the resid of men I tell you amen
[27:30] God's going to build out of the residue
[27:32] of men in other words he's going to take
[27:34] the low parts and he's going to use them
[27:36] to build this bride that he's talking
[27:39] about this Tabernacle or this tent of
[27:42] David is talking about the housing place
[27:44] of the Ark of the Covenant it's where it
[27:46] would be it would be put in the residue
[27:48] of men and he would seek after the Lord
[27:50] and all the Gentiles upon whom my name
[27:53] is called sayith the Lord who does all
[27:56] these things so in other words he's
[27:58] saying this is not Simon and this is not
[28:01] Paul and Barnabas doing this but this is
[28:04] God doing this and watch in the 18th
[28:07] verse known unto God are all his works
[28:10] from the beginning of the world so he
[28:13] said not only is it that Amos prophesied
[28:15] this but the one that's doing it knew he
[28:18] would do it before the beginning of the
[28:19] world isn't it amazing that this bride
[28:22] was chosen not in this age she was not
[28:25] chosen 200 years ago or or even here in
[28:28] the book of Acts when they're talking
[28:30] about the prophecy but God chose this
[28:33] bride before the foundations of the
[28:35] world that everything that he did had in
[28:38] mind a bride that he was going to choose
[28:41] and use and become a part of him amen
[28:44] Simon had declared it that God did visit
[28:46] the Gentiles to take out of them a
[28:48] people for his name amen other words a
[28:52] place to display himself a place to the
[28:56] Bible actually says that they would he
[28:57] would take them out for a people for his
[28:59] name it means he would superimpose over
[29:02] them his own name he would Place upon
[29:06] them his identity he would put up upon
[29:08] them his grace now in Hosea 1 and9 you
[29:11] know the prophecies and these are just
[29:13] prophecies to show you like if I say I
[29:16] had something on my mind you said well
[29:17] I'm not sure and then I went and picked
[29:19] up five sealed letters and brought them
[29:21] back to you and broke them open and said
[29:22] now back 2,000 years ago here's what I
[29:24] was thinking and and and 500 years ago
[29:27] here's what I was thinking so it would
[29:29] unsealing it would reveal this has been
[29:31] there the whole time but now it's being
[29:33] brought to you so all the way back in
[29:35] Hosea he said I will call his name laomi
[29:39] in other words Hosea is going to have a
[29:40] child by Goomer and then he's going to
[29:42] bring forth and when they name the child
[29:45] the name of this child is going to see
[29:47] you are not my people he says and I will
[29:50] not be your God but yet the number of
[29:53] the children of Israel should be as the
[29:54] Sands of the sea which cannot be
[29:56] measured by numbered it shall come to
[29:58] pass that in the place where it is said
[30:00] ye are not my people there it shall be
[30:03] said unto them you are the sons of the
[30:06] Living God now you Bible readers know
[30:08] that doesn't say the Servants of the
[30:10] Living God it said the sons of the
[30:12] Living God when God is dealing with
[30:14] Israel he's dealing with servants when
[30:16] he's dealing with Gentiles he's dealing
[30:18] with sons and here it says you shall be
[30:20] the sons of the Living God Amen all the
[30:24] way back in Hosea he was saying these
[30:27] people that are not L of people they're
[30:29] going to be my people and the people
[30:31] shall be a people that I will write my
[30:33] name upon them I'll tell you it's a
[30:35] powerful thing in Romans Paul explains
[30:38] the prophecy and he says he says also
[30:41] even us whom Heath called not Jews only
[30:44] but also Gentiles when he said in Hosea
[30:47] amen I will call them my people which
[30:49] were not my people and beloved which
[30:52] were not beloved and it shall come to
[30:54] pass in the place where it is said unto
[30:56] them you are not my people there they
[30:58] shall be called the children of the
[31:00] Living God that's why Peter prophesies
[31:02] in 1 Peter 2:9 you are a chosen
[31:05] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[31:08] nation A peculiar people that you should
[31:11] show forth the Praises of him that have
[31:13] called you out of Darkness into
[31:15] Marvelous Light where in times past you
[31:18] were not a people amen he's telling you
[31:22] I knew where you were I knew the kind of
[31:25] people you were but now we have a
[31:27] obtained mercy and we are be called the
[31:30] people of God Amen I know this sounds
[31:33] like amen it sounds like oh he's talking
[31:35] about Peter and Paul and Hosea and
[31:37] you're thinking about something years
[31:38] and years ago but I want you to
[31:40] understand amen that you sitting here as
[31:43] a people was such a motive in everything
[31:46] God did that all the way back to Hosea
[31:49] he was having people named kids that was
[31:52] going to tell you years later I had him
[31:55] named this baby so one day a preacher
[31:58] could stand in the pull pit and tell you
[32:00] the name of the child means you weren't
[32:03] my people but now you are my people and
[32:06] you have obtained Mercy he had Peter
[32:09] prophesy it and say to you I called you
[32:11] out of Darkness into Marvelous Light you
[32:14] talk about light I'm talking about bride
[32:17] light I'm talking about somebody that
[32:18] can turn the lights on in your dark life
[32:21] and tell you that God had you on his
[32:23] mind he had you in Prophecy of this
[32:25] Bible before the world's ever be
[32:28] this bride takes the name of the deity
[32:32] of Jesus Christ a name represents a
[32:35] character of life and the name of Jesus
[32:38] Christ is the character of the life of
[32:41] almighty God Jehovah's elected salvation
[32:45] saves us Jesus Joshua the Savior God
[32:50] salvation it's the life of Jesus Christ
[32:53] that is in the church I tell you this
[32:55] the name of God is the very character
[32:58] it's not just the name it's the life
[33:02] that's behind the name and think about
[33:04] it this morning there's a life that's in
[33:06] this bride that was the same life that
[33:09] was in Jesus Christ I'll tell you this
[33:11] God has gave us a position and he has
[33:14] put us legally in a place where he can
[33:16] deal with us anytime he wants to come on
[33:19] Church there's no laws governing when he
[33:22] can deal with us no more not times or
[33:24] dates or moons or ecclesiastics or laws
[33:28] in the days of Moses yall know laws you
[33:30] know it was laws that dealt with the
[33:32] Israel people and only certain times
[33:34] they could come only certain times they
[33:36] could have Lambs y'all know what's right
[33:38] had to be of a certain lineage to go
[33:40] into the holies of holies and only then
[33:42] one time a year and you could only see
[33:44] the fire and you couldn't get close and
[33:46] listen but what God did is he created a
[33:49] position called bride that he removed
[33:52] every law and every tradition and every
[33:55] Dogma that God could walk in the middle
[33:58] of your life on a Sunday morning and the
[34:00] Holy Ghost can fall he don't have to ask
[34:03] questions he don't have to ask nobody if
[34:05] he can he don't have to have a certain
[34:07] lineage or a certain race or a certain
[34:10] place amen God who is rich in Mercy
[34:13] could come in this building when he
[34:14] wants how he wants anytime he wants
[34:17] because he is God and he can legally
[34:21] move the way he wants to move he created
[34:25] a position called bride yes woo glory be
[34:28] to
[34:30] God pise that he might be able to
[34:32] legally do it that's why he called it
[34:34] the Tabernacle of David
[34:36] right y'all know the Tabernacle of David
[34:38] didn't have the laws connected to it it
[34:40] had the ark and yet I think many of the
[34:42] Psalms were written right outside the
[34:44] tent and that wasn't under it was daily
[34:47] sacrifices daily Praises it it bypassed
[34:50] all the laws Moses law was still set up
[34:52] down there right but David was under
[34:55] another law he was under prophet phy of
[34:58] praise and rejoicing speaking of one day
[35:02] there would come something that would be
[35:04] outside the Traditions that he could do
[35:07] what he wanted to with he created a
[35:09] position called
[35:11] bride so that he could do this by his
[35:14] own
[35:14] word I'll tell you it's a powerful thing
[35:18] the predestinated place it's
[35:21] predestinated in other words when God
[35:23] did this he did it all the way back in
[35:25] his mind so everything he did from that
[35:28] time forward would reveal that that was
[35:30] what was on his mind uh you're if you're
[35:33] building a house how many house builders
[35:34] we got in here if you're building a
[35:36] house and you got a you know if you're
[35:38] custom building and a lady says to you
[35:40] look hey I got this vest I bought in
[35:43] Egypt and it's it's this big and it's
[35:46] this and this and I'd like to have it
[35:47] right in my living room and I'd like to
[35:49] have it in that back corner there and I
[35:51] want a notch and I want it a certain way
[35:52] and I want lights on it and you know
[35:54] that before you start
[35:55] building so when you start build
[35:57] building that living room you got a
[35:59] funny looking spot back there and every
[36:01] other Builder that don't know that plan
[36:02] and they don't know that thought they'll
[36:04] wonder why is he doing that right well
[36:07] we don't do it like that down at our
[36:08] church we we we just cover that right
[36:10] off and but see he knows there's
[36:13] something
[36:14] coming so he builds it with the thought
[36:16] in mind and it usually nobody knows
[36:19] about it until it's finished and then
[36:21] the whole thing is revealed at the same
[36:23] time I thank God for it knowing amen
[36:27] that that we see that when God begins to
[36:29] reveal it that that thought is there now
[36:32] all the way now this was Jesus himself
[36:34] look back to Matthew 20 if if some of
[36:36] these scriptures are um um how can I say
[36:39] if they're common to you we're doing our
[36:41] job yeah in Matthew the 20th chapter I
[36:45] was reading some scriptures to some to a
[36:47] family one day here maybe a year ago and
[36:50] a lady said what why don't we know these
[36:52] scriptures in the Bible I said well I
[36:54] don't know I'm sorry whoever you're
[36:56] whoever's training you I I think they
[36:58] should have probably showed you these
[36:59] scriptures so I don't want to show up
[37:01] that day and said Lord said why didn't
[37:02] you show them them
[37:04] scriptures I want you to see these
[37:06] scriptures in Matthew the 20th chapter
[37:09] then came to him the mother of zebedee's
[37:13] children which were her sons worshiping
[37:16] him and Desiring a certain thing of him
[37:18] yeah Jesus of course in the 21st verse
[37:22] it said and he said unto her what will
[37:24] thou she said unto him Grant these my
[37:25] two sons
[37:27] that they may set the one on the right
[37:29] the other on the left in thy kingdom and
[37:31] Jesus answered and said you know not
[37:34] what you asked now you're able to drink
[37:35] of the cup and be baptized with the
[37:38] baptism I'm baptized and they said unto
[37:40] him we are able he saith unto them you
[37:42] shall drink of my cup baptized with a
[37:44] baptism I'm baptized but to sit on my
[37:46] right hand and on my left is not mine to
[37:50] give but it shall be given to them for
[37:54] whom it is prepared of my father
[37:58] but it is to be given to them who is
[38:00] prepared of my father now it's amazing
[38:03] to me that this is the sons of zebedy
[38:06] that her the mother is wanting them to
[38:08] sit on the throne they're wanting them
[38:10] to share the throne with Jesus she
[38:12] recognizes his kingship and authority
[38:15] and what's amazing if you go back and
[38:16] read in the Book of Matthew you'll find
[38:19] that the sons of zebede of course are
[38:21] James and John and it's here it is in
[38:24] the Book of Matthew James is hearing
[38:27] from Jesus's own words look they can't
[38:30] set in this place because it has been
[38:34] predestinated for another people other
[38:36] words we're saving the seat right here I
[38:38] know they're not here right now but
[38:39] there's people coming and they got to
[38:41] have a place to be and I have gave them
[38:44] this place and it's James is the one
[38:47] that's hearing this of his own life I
[38:49] can't take it I thought wasn't it
[38:51] something that over in the book of Acts
[38:53] when they're all fussing about Gentiles
[38:55] not having a place in the power of God
[38:57] it was James that knew the prophecy in
[39:00] the Book of Amos that prophesied the
[39:02] Gentiles would sit there I thought oh
[39:05] God Amen even this man James under the
[39:08] inspiration of Jesus knew there was
[39:10] something coming out of that Gentile
[39:12] race here he is using scripture to prove
[39:16] the people set there are going to be
[39:18] Gentiles see it was not them tog now if
[39:22] you if how can I overcome 1963 brother R
[39:24] said there's a mother's desire for her
[39:26] son watch that place Jesus said was
[39:30] predestinated the position was not in
[39:32] existence at that time but it will be
[39:34] granted to them who it's meant for the
[39:36] one set to the right hand the other the
[39:38] closest yet was an overcomer see I don't
[39:42] Grant this I grant this but it will be
[39:44] given after the trial
[39:47] comes after the trial comes how many
[39:50] knows who it was meant for after the
[39:53] trial comes remember the adoption series
[39:56] brother Ram talks about amen that every
[39:58] son must be
[39:59] tried and after his trial then he
[40:03] conquered every gate and brother B then
[40:05] teaches adoption and tells us that
[40:07] you're a son but you got to be trained
[40:09] you got to be tried and after the trial
[40:12] then you possess every gate is that
[40:14] right come on church amen and the trial
[40:17] would not come until the lay out to see
[40:18] and age that's why adoption age don't
[40:21] come until leosa when the Bible said he
[40:24] that overcometh I grant to him to set in
[40:28] my right hand and at my left hand isn't
[40:30] it amazing that adopted church is that
[40:33] bride who's Ephesians five the great
[40:36] mystery Paul was revealing is that this
[40:39] position of bride is the adopted sons of
[40:43] Romans the eth chapter they are the
[40:45] manifested sons that have been on the
[40:48] mind of God from the foundation of the
[40:50] world God will work through that body
[40:53] and he will do it with legal rights can
[40:55] you imagine what God wants to do
[40:57] somebody well you can't work here and
[40:58] you can't work here and you can't work
[41:00] here he said I'll create a position I
[41:02] can I'll prophesy a place I'll make my
[41:06] own place I hope you hear me this
[41:08] morning that's why William brandom cried
[41:10] out in the end of his ministry I'll ride
[41:12] this Trail again it wasn't brother
[41:15] brandom going to ride again amen but
[41:17] Christ was prophesying a place for
[41:20] himself in a bride Ministry that would
[41:23] come in the last day he can do it
[41:25] legally people say well only a prophet
[41:28] could do that amen but a prophet spoke a
[41:31] place for you and I to manifest God in
[41:34] the age we're living in we are working
[41:37] on the authority of a prophet we are not
[41:40] presuming we are not trying to be
[41:42] something we are not we're not trying to
[41:45] make oursel bride he married us he chose
[41:49] us he anointed us he redeemed us this is
[41:53] his work Hallelujah be to God
[41:57] chose you and elected you I don't care
[42:00] what you think about yourself this
[42:02] morning I know what the Bible says about
[42:05] you I know what the prophecy says about
[42:08] you you say I'm not going to make it I
[42:10] said that there's 2,000 year old
[42:12] prophecies laying here that says you
[42:15] will make it and you won't just make it
[42:17] but you're going to overcome you're
[42:19] going to rise up above every bit of

[43:58] really time for somebody to let you in
[43:59] that you bypassed your first birth your
[44:02] word birth and you were born into this
[44:06] Earth but that word that you bypassed
[44:09] has come to catch
[44:11] you that word you byass has come to
[44:14] catch you and there's a junction in the
[44:16] road immortality step down on the Route
[44:19] 66 you were living on you bypassed it
[44:23] but God met you in the junction and
[44:25] brought you back to the word of God
[44:27] listen amen this bride is already
[44:29] married to him how could he ever forget
[44:32] her how could he let her go he said oh a
[44:35] suckling babe could forget their mother
[44:37] or the mother forget their baby he said
[44:39] but how could I ever forget you come on
[44:41] take a measuring stick and measure the
[44:43] ocean you say I can't then how could he
[44:46] ever forget you how could you measure it
[44:48] how could you look at it but God who is
[44:50] rich in Mercy had it in his
[44:53] mind woo everything he did had
[44:57] everything he saw every place he went it
[45:00] spoke of his
[45:03] intentions it's amazing to me we're the
[45:06] children of Abraham the Royal seed right
[45:08] the Royal seed the Royal bride seed yeah
[45:13] now everybody knows that Jesus was the
[45:14] royal seed but the Royal seed's got a
[45:16] bride so it's a royal Queen
[45:19] seed and and the and and you go all the
[45:21] way back to Genesis
[45:23] 22 and you find that this is this is
[45:26] when they've traveled and they get out
[45:27] on the mountain and and Isaac and
[45:30] Abraham's going to go up on the mountain
[45:31] remember the story and Abraham's
[45:34] carrying the wood yeah and God had told
[45:36] him to take his son up there and crucify
[45:38] him and burn him on the steak and
[45:41] remember then Abraham had said the boy
[45:43] and I'll
[45:44] go the boy and I'll return yeah he knew
[45:48] even if he had to destroy his body that
[45:52] God had gave him from the dead he was
[45:54] able to raise him from the dead
[45:57] yeah he had a perfect faith in what he
[46:00] had received from God now now folks that
[46:03] Mountain's very important because what
[46:05] you're seeing is he's tested on the
[46:07] thing he was
[46:08] given he he had a test he he he spent 25
[46:12] years waiting for the child now the
[46:14] child's about 14 year old and he's
[46:16] tested on the child yeah see you waited
[46:18] for the message for 400 years yeah the
[46:21] prophecies are 2,000 years of Prophecy
[46:23] waiting for this message to come right
[46:26] but but after you get the message you're
[46:28] going to be tested on
[46:29] it oh brother bam missed it here and he
[46:32] said that he did
[46:34] the see the bride Church the adopted
[46:38] church is tested on the
[46:41] message the message ain't on
[46:44] trial your faith is on
[46:48] [Applause]
[46:50] trial wow you can say well I don't know
[46:52] if brother bram's right that's already
[46:54] settled that's 60y old LS it's in the
[46:57] history books what the question today is
[47:01] is who is that
[47:03] bride where's she at amen how do we find
[47:06] her she's tested on it and that true bde
[47:10] will be tested on it watch when you go
[47:11] up Genesis 22 any commentator that you
[47:14] read can tell you that Isaac was
[47:17] Jesus he was carrying his own cross
[47:20] carrying his own wood up the cross the
[47:22] son of Abraham yeah Human Sacrifice yeah
[47:26] yeah Isaac was Jesus yeah yeah but it's
[47:30] not until the end time that you can find
[47:32] the bride in that
[47:34] scripture do you know the brides in
[47:36] there you don't see her until the
[47:40] story's told cuz let me can I can I can
[47:42] I paraphrase to youall Bor Brother Ray
[47:45] I'm gonna paraphrase it won't be exact
[47:47] so don't count it
[47:50] okay but let me ask you something what
[47:53] did Abraham tell
[47:54] Isaac what did he tell him to get him to
[47:57] sacrifice his own life what kind of
[48:00] story did he tell now see if Abraham
[48:02] would have come at a different time he
[48:03] couldn't told him this right he he meant
[48:06] there was a time MDC came promise came
[48:08] Elohim visited him on the tree he had
[48:10] all kinds of different experiences and
[48:11] 25 years of waiting talk about Earth
[48:14] child had had Isaac appeared in any
[48:16] other part of the story he wouldn't have
[48:18] been able to hear it all but on the
[48:20] mountain up there on that altar see
[48:23] Isaac could hear the entire Redemptive
[48:26] story yeah right he could tell him about
[48:29] from the moment he met God in ER chalis
[48:32] yeah and his journey and his security
[48:35] and how he how he lied about his mama
[48:37] and how he had a body change and how God
[48:40] protected her and how Elohim come and he
[48:42] he could have convinced Isaac and
[48:45] brought him into the same faith that
[48:48] Abraham had that Isaac could have said
[48:51] you're right Dad the god that brought me
[48:53] here if you take my life he could Raise
[48:56] Me Up then here take my life I'll lay it
[48:58] down
[48:59] willingly you see that when that full
[49:02] story is told all the sudden they hear a
[49:06] sound in the bush and it was a ram
[49:09] caught in the thicket right now the
[49:12] Bible is clear to say it was a ram
[49:14] caught with his horns in the thicket now
[49:17] there's that
[49:18] bride that Ram in the bush somebody said
[49:21] well way what the world you talking
[49:23] about listen now and Jehovah JRA brother
[49:26] Ram said God provides his own right now
[49:30] if you go back to Genesis 15 and I'll
[49:32] just lay this in and carry on you can
[49:33] ask me later if you need some answers on
[49:35] it but in Genesis 15 Abraham has
[49:38] promised he's going to have a seed he's
[49:40] going to have a he's going to have an
[49:41] air right going to have a seed and he
[49:43] tells the Lord in Genesis 15 he don't
[49:45] have one only eler this servant is all I
[49:47] have is an heir of my home how do I know
[49:50] I shall inherit and God said well I'll
[49:51] tell you it's easy go down build an
[49:53] altar and take of the Altar and I want
[49:55] you to take five animals down there
[49:56] there and remember what he does he takes
[49:58] a he takes a a a she goat and I think a
[50:03] a oo or lamb and then he says the third
[50:06] one was a
[50:09] ram and brother Ram said now I want you
[50:11] to notice this the first two sacrifices
[50:14] on that altar were
[50:16] female okay but the third one is a he
[50:19] it's a
[50:21] ram showing you the bride will never
[50:24] take a church name
[50:28] feminine she will never take the name
[50:30] Baptist see she'll never take the name
[50:33] Lutheran she will never take the
[50:36] church's
[50:37] name but the real is the manifested
[50:43] word so she's going to take his
[50:47] name I will have a people for my name
[50:51] see there's a there's people joining
[50:53] churches everywhere and they're taking
[50:55] the name of Baptist or Lutheran or
[50:58] Presbyterian and God bless all the
[51:00] people I'm not against none of the
[51:01] people amen but the name they're taking
[51:05] is the name of a religion or Society or
[51:08] something somewhere but God produced
[51:10] this message which was the spoken
[51:14] manifested word and that is the mate of
[51:17] the church when you see that it was the
[51:19] third one in line what was it it was
[51:22] Christ marrying the bride that bride is
[51:25] right there there's Malachi four I shall
[51:27] restore saith the Lord amen bringing the
[51:30] children back it was there under the
[51:32] realm now if you want to study that it's
[51:34] Jehovah jbra part 3 1964 paragraph 209
[51:38] the Royal seed will not be called by the
[51:40] church denomination of sheot no but by
[51:43] him the manifested word of the realm he
[51:46] is the word of the ram see he would take
[51:48] a people for his name and bear his name
[51:52] oh what are you afraid for then a
[51:54] gentile will bear his name the realm not
[51:57] her the church he Hallelujah see it's he
[52:02] amen it's the word the church has become
[52:04] joined with what is it he was the word
[52:07] not her him the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:10] Vindicated word Now by The Promise the
[52:12] word that was promised amen it has come
[52:15] to him you see what it is he would write
[52:18] his name upon her all the way back to
[52:21] this we find him prophesying in
[52:23] Abraham's day speaking of ram speaking
[52:26] of the Bride marrying the word in that
[52:29] generation amen now it's amazing to me
[52:32] because that John all the way in the
[52:34] Book of Revelations is prophesying amen
[52:37] that he would call this bride a city
[52:41] isn't it amazing that in one place you
[52:43] seeing yourself as RAM typed in
[52:46] scripture another place you're seeing
[52:48] yourself in the heavens as a or a child
[52:50] that's being born or you're seeing
[52:52] yourself in many ways but when John saw
[52:54] you he saw you as a city amen isn't it
[52:58] amazing to me that the most the most
[53:01] glorious City in all of the scripture
[53:03] was the city of New
[53:05] Jerusalem and when bride amen when you
[53:08] were saw by John in the scripture John
[53:11] was seeing a revelation of you as City
[53:14] you know what's amazing John saw two
[53:17] great cities in the Bible and both of
[53:19] them were mysterious cities he saw one
[53:22] of them which was the city of Babylon
[53:25] great mystery Babylon
[53:27] in Revelation 17 And1 and there came one
[53:29] of the Seven Angels which one of them
[53:31] seven angels you reckon it was amen had
[53:33] seven vows and talk with me saying come
[53:36] hither and I will show unto thee the
[53:38] Judgment of the great horde that set up
[53:40] upon many Waters who revealed the Harlot
[53:43] system yeah that seventh angel and the
[53:48] angel said unto me John why did you
[53:51] Marvel at what you have seen I'll tell
[53:53] thee seventh verse I'll tell thee The
[53:55] Mystery of the woman woman and the Beast
[53:57] that Carri her the way the seven horns
[53:59] what was it he began to see that this
[54:02] woman was drunk with the blood of saints
[54:04] so John begin to reveal that will be two
[54:07] Brides In the End Time there will be two
[54:10] great cities one of those cities will be
[54:12] a city of God and the other will be the
[54:14] habitation of devils and every unclean
[54:16] thing amen the same one who revealed
[54:20] mystery Babylon also reveals the New
[54:22] Jerusalem in Revelation 21:9 he said in
[54:25] one of the Angels had the seven vows of
[54:28] the last plagues talk to me saying come
[54:29] hither I will show Thee the bride the
[54:32] Lamb's wife I will show Thee the bride
[54:36] the Lamb's wife don't have time to
[54:37] preach on it but he don't say the Lion's
[54:39] wife does he it's the Lamb's wife and
[54:42] and we see then he describes the city of
[54:45] Babylon as a place of confusion now
[54:49] notice he's showing you the difference
[54:51] in the charistics will be prophesied of
[54:53] those cities when he shows you Babylon
[54:55] it's a place of confusion and the Bible
[54:58] said upon her head was written the
[55:00] mystery Babylon the mother of harlots
[55:03] and the Abominations of the Earth the
[55:05] scripture tells us she's the habitation
[55:07] of every clean and hateful bird the
[55:11] prophet of God calls it the house of
[55:13] Hell her gates are the gates to hell she
[55:16] has a theological Max Factor to cover up
[55:19] the gates to make it look beautiful but
[55:22] within her Gates is the Gates of Hell
[55:24] Amen in Revelations 18 and two we find
[55:27] that a lighted Angel comes out of the
[55:29] heaven to call the children out of
[55:31] Babylon and come out of that City
[55:34] because the Bible prophesies she'll be
[55:36] destroyed in the space of one
[55:38] hour now folks when has any City ever
[55:41] been destroyed in the space of one hour
[55:44] but Atomic Warfare is going to make it
[55:47] possible that a city could be destroyed
[55:50] in the space of one hour amen what is it
[55:52] it's the cage of every unclean and every
[55:55] hateful bird describing a church that is
[55:59] full of the
[56:00] devil an antichrist system a city a
[56:04] woman it's a church it's a place of
[56:06] religion amen but it has Blasphemous
[56:09] names isn't it something the name
[56:11] written upon them is the name of
[56:13] blasphemy but there's another city and
[56:16] that New Jerusalem has another name it's
[56:19] not the name of blasphemy it's the name
[56:21] of God written upon her is the
[56:24] interpretation of the word of God god
[56:27] listen folks amen they ought to see has
[56:29] uh uh lukewarm and and and blind and
[56:32] naked and miserable and they don't know
[56:34] it and people look around and they say I
[56:36] wonder what that means but Le oia is
[56:38] interpreting that scripture they have
[56:41] the interpretation of it but the bride
[56:43] has the
[56:44] interpretation of this New Jerusalem
[56:47] city of what she would be in Revelation
[56:50] 21 John said I saw a new Heaven and a
[56:52] new Earth the first Heaven and the first
[56:55] Earth were passed away and there were no
[56:56] more sea and I saw a holy city a New
[57:00] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[57:03] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[57:06] her husband and I heard a great voice
[57:09] out of Heaven saying behold the
[57:11] Tabernacle of God is with men and we
[57:14] dwell with them and they shall be his
[57:15] people and God himself shall be with
[57:18] them and shall be their God I'm
[57:22] prophesying I'm telling you your
[57:24] position in scripture come on watch
[57:26] watch this in Revelation 219 go back to
[57:29] it again and watch this Angel the
[57:31] seventh one I I just say it clearly the
[57:33] seventh one he said I will show Thee the
[57:36] bride the Lamb's wife is that not what
[57:39] he said I will show Thee the bride the
[57:41] Lamb's wife look at the next verse and
[57:43] the 10th verse and he carried me away in
[57:47] the spirit to a great and high mountain
[57:50] and showed me a great City isn't it
[57:53] something I'm going to show you a bride
[57:55] but he show him a city because the city
[57:58] of New Jerusalem types the Bride of
[58:01] Jesus Christ that's right she is the New
[58:03] Jerusalem she is the high mountain of
[58:06] God she is God's worship place in this
[58:10] hour you know when we look at this many
[58:12] times you if you're studying scripture
[58:14] and you want to you want to find it it's
[58:16] called Mount Zion in scripture bride is
[58:18] always Mount Zion right that's what the
[58:20] prophet said you know what Zion actually
[58:23] represents it the name Zion actually
[58:25] means son Sunny
[58:27] Place well I I liked it anyhow I thought
[58:30] it's pretty good Zion actually means
[58:33] Sunny place do you know Zion is actually
[58:37] built on a mountain and according to
[58:39] according to many of the writers amen
[58:42] the name Zion actually means Sunny place
[58:45] because it's the first place where light
[58:47] will strike in that Holy City I tell you
[58:50] friend amen you see everything else
[58:53] could be in darkness but them that are
[58:55] OPP Zion they shall see the light in the
[58:59] troubled times when everything else is
[59:01] setting in darkness there is a light
[59:04] that is shining in this New Jerusalem I
[59:07] know it's dark in leosia oh but to the
[59:10] bride Rise and Shine the Light of the
[59:14] word has come upon the church we amen we
[59:17] see the morning as it has come unto us
[59:21] this city has 12 gates and Foundations
[59:24] it is the tribes of Israel and the
[59:26] Patriarchs of old her cities are cities
[59:30] her streets are streets of gold and her
[59:32] gates are Gates of Pearl and I I know
[59:35] there's so much to preach on those Gates
[59:37] I I think years back our brother uh
[59:39] Brother Francis from over in South
[59:41] Africa done a whole whole series on
[59:43] Gates if you want to study the gates you
[59:45] probably get with brother Brian he's
[59:46] probably still got them but oh my
[59:48] goodness how
[59:49] powerful how powerful but those Gates of
[59:52] pearl you know they actually say the
[59:54] reason they call them Pearl is cuz it's
[59:55] over overcoming right a pearl is is
[59:59] what's made shiny and lustrous because
[1:00:02] it's in a because it's in a a shell I've
[1:00:05] seen many of them shiny little fellas
[1:00:07] some of them ain't perfectly round but
[1:00:09] they all got a beautiful luster on them
[1:00:11] and they shine nice because you know
[1:00:14] what causes that is friction they
[1:00:16] they're in a in a shell and there's a
[1:00:18] lot of sand and the water going in and
[1:00:20] out it just keeps rubbing them like this
[1:00:22] and after a while it'll polish them
[1:00:23] dudes up amen so I'll tell you
[1:00:26] anytime you see Pearl you see overcoming
[1:00:29] anytime you see Pearl you see somebody
[1:00:31] has overcome amen I know it's adversity
[1:00:34] and I know it's trouble amen but her
[1:00:36] gates are the gates of pearl them that
[1:00:38] come in come in through overcoming
[1:00:40] Church you don't get in this without
[1:00:42] overcoming amen but it's a city of
[1:00:44] Overcomers it's a city amen where you
[1:00:47] walk on streets of gold her steps are
[1:00:49] steps of deity do you know this bride
[1:00:52] amen we're not talking about deity just
[1:00:54] in Jesus I'm talking about deity in you
[1:00:57] and every footstep you take deity is in
[1:01:00] the bride of Christ oh Hallelujah she's
[1:01:03] a city oh a city to look at you are the
[1:01:06] household of God of foundations of
[1:01:08] Apostles and Prophets and we just
[1:01:10] preached on that so I'll not go down
[1:01:12] that line but this mystery Bride is a
[1:01:14] great mystery it is God's Eternal
[1:01:17] mystery brother Bram said but now has
[1:01:19] been unfolded in Jesus Christ and given
[1:01:22] down to his church what was once in
[1:01:25] God's mind is now in the body of
[1:01:29] Christ what was once in God's mind is
[1:01:32] now in the body of Christ amen amen
[1:01:36] that's what God Christ is doing in the
[1:01:39] church he's letting her know his
[1:01:43] Secrets what is it he's revealing this
[1:01:47] word that you might see your position in
[1:01:50] the word brother bam calls it he said
[1:01:52] you don't know how much it means to see
[1:01:55] yourself positionally in the
[1:01:58] scriptures you I I just want to say this
[1:02:00] to you if you're trying to find yourself
[1:02:03] find yourself in the word yeah amen if
[1:02:08] you're trying to find yourself find
[1:02:10] yourself in the word I'm going to tell
[1:02:11] you something thank be to God every time

[1:05:21] the story it's not just a coming out she
[1:05:24] didn't just come out of Jer

[1:05:28] Jesus Christ because she got

[1:05:35] out of denomination we're getting

[1:05:45] second Eve brother Richard the Second
[1:05:47] Eve you know what Eve should have done
[1:05:48] in the garden she should have brought
[1:05:50] Christ and she should have done it by
[1:05:52] the spoken word but Eve failed to do it
[1:05:55] it and Mary brought the manifested word
[1:05:59] and now we find out today we are another
[1:06:01] Eve and Christ is coming through this
[1:06:05] body into this age oh Church of the
[1:06:08] Living God I hope you got your seat belt
[1:06:10] on but Christ is descending into this
[1:06:14] age through your body it's coming out of

[1:06:22] Christ
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:25] oh Hallelujah your name is
[1:06:28] Rahab your name is Tamar come on Esther
[1:06:32] your name is estri preacher you got all
[1:06:34] these names in the Bible cuz you type
[1:06:36] every one of them amen your name is
[1:06:38] Esther you come running into the throne
[1:06:40] room and grab the scepter but what are
[1:06:42] you going to do with it she saved all of
[1:06:45] her seed by giving them Authority if you
[1:06:49] give this bride Authority they won't
[1:06:51] just try to get a new house or a new car
[1:06:54] or a new building they bring Salvation
[1:06:57] to those by the word of God that they
[1:07:00] believe you are the voice of Mercy to
[1:07:02] this age come on you're a Tamar and
[1:07:05] Esther you're a
[1:07:08] Rahab whether you like it or not you're
[1:07:10] a be
[1:07:12] Sheba come on you were in adulterer but
[1:07:16] your old husband died and the King took
[1:07:19] you the wife come on church amen thank
[1:07:22] be to God for Redemption stories hey
[1:07:26] I'll tell you brother Wayne God can't
[1:07:27] choose me I've got this problem I got
[1:07:29] this problem he already made the
[1:07:32] choice he made the choice when he chose
[1:07:35] Rahab and he made Tamar and he Cho now
[1:07:38] now Sister Hannah I want you to be sure
[1:07:39] that you understand that God is God and
[1:07:41] he don't change do we agree that God
[1:07:43] can't never change his mind and what he
[1:07:45] done in one age he has to do in another
[1:07:47] age so if God was wanting to choose a
[1:07:50] bride who would actually try to
[1:07:52] disqualify herself by her own failures
[1:07:56] and by her own circumstances he would
[1:07:58] choose one all the way back there who he
[1:08:02] qualified by his own work that when he
[1:08:05] come up here and he said will you marry
[1:08:07] me and you said well I can't do this and
[1:08:10] I can't do this he said oh but I made
[1:08:11] the choice all the way back
[1:08:14] there I chose you
[1:08:19] then he wasn't choosing Rahab he was
[1:08:21] choosing
[1:08:23] you thank you Lord he wasn't choosing
[1:08:26] Esther brother Kylie was choosing you
[1:08:29] because one day he would give a throne
[1:08:31] and he would give a scepter and he
[1:08:33] wanted to know what are you going to do
[1:08:34] with it your character is in
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:08:42] Esther see before you give somebody
[1:08:45] Authority you got to know what they're
[1:08:46] going to do with
[1:08:48] it your character has already shown what
[1:08:52] would be done with it yeah h
[1:08:56] Hallelujah y'all know I'm telling the
[1:09:00] truth that's why in revelation 22
[1:09:04] brother Eric he could say the spirit and
[1:09:05] the bride say come and the prophet of
[1:09:09] God would take that scripture and say
[1:09:10] that you are the final
[1:09:12] voice to a final age not a voice of
[1:09:17] Vengeance but a voice of
[1:09:19] Mercy it's the voice that is in the
[1:09:23] bride do you see God still has a voice
[1:09:27] but that voice is in the bride yeah now
[1:09:30] what has happened is God took the
[1:09:33] feminist part of
[1:09:36] himself I know sometimes it's hard to
[1:09:38] believe this but let's just get down to
[1:09:40] the fact yeah yeah he took out the
[1:09:43] feminist part and put it in
[1:09:48] you he put his own Spirit In You amen
[1:09:54] is't that powerful yeah because now she
[1:09:57] is flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:09:58] bone and power of his power she is him
[1:10:03] amen now these elect are the Eternal
[1:10:06] thoughts of God and who were elect
[1:10:08] before the world began so therefore God
[1:10:10] at this moment is not the author of a
[1:10:13] physical creation he's the author of
[1:10:15] another creation a creation called
[1:10:18] bride this creation of bride would be a
[1:10:22] new kind of people yeah Jes Jesus being
[1:10:26] the bridegroom was the head of the body
[1:10:28] right and he is the beginning of a new
[1:10:32] race of people that race being a God man
[1:10:37] now you all sitting here today have
[1:10:39] heard great great Scholars argue whether
[1:10:42] he was God or man and the trinitarians
[1:10:46] take it to task that he was God Amen and
[1:10:49] then they'll take it to task that he was
[1:10:51] a
[1:10:52] man and I see people that they they I
[1:10:55] remember years ago the Oneness groups
[1:10:57] they didn't really believe Jesus could
[1:10:59] have had a family if they didn't believe
[1:11:00] Jesus in the in the Tomb would have
[1:11:02] rotted but but he would have
[1:11:04] now because he was a
[1:11:06] man and the Bible said he was tempted of
[1:11:08] every type every like manner as you were
[1:11:11] tempted everything you go through he
[1:11:13] went through yeah right he was tempted
[1:11:16] of every like manner that he might be
[1:11:18] able to secure us in our Temptations
[1:11:21] right so he was both
[1:11:23] God and he was man
[1:11:25] now if you if you take any of the man
[1:11:28] part he's not your
[1:11:29] Kinsman and if you take any of the god
[1:11:32] part he was not your Redeemer to save
[1:11:34] you so he has to be God and he has to be
[1:11:38] man so in the Middle Ages they come up
[1:11:40] with a word called the hypostatic union
[1:11:42] and I and I'm not trying to get deep
[1:11:44] into theology but it's called a
[1:11:45] hypostatic union and it was used as a
[1:11:47] way to describe a union that would allow
[1:11:50] two things to come together and remain
[1:11:52] both the same thing but live in the same
[1:11:55] same body so in other words Jesus didn't
[1:11:58] have to be less man to be
[1:12:00] God and he didn't have to be less God to
[1:12:03] be
[1:12:04] man W
[1:12:06] Brothers it was a union between God and
[1:12:10] man and only God could do it most
[1:12:13] writers will end up calling it a paradox
[1:12:16] well that's a good word for it it's a
[1:12:18] paradox come on church but he was the
[1:12:22] beginning of that
[1:12:23] race and and and I remember years ago I
[1:12:26] was studying on the thought and then the
[1:12:27] Bible said don't be unequally Yol one
[1:12:29] with the other and and when he and when
[1:12:31] the when I read that something struck my
[1:12:32] heart and I thought that's right amen
[1:12:36] God is not taking an unequal
[1:12:39] mate yeah amen God is not talking it's
[1:12:43] not like a dog marrying a
[1:12:45] cat right come on church it's not like a
[1:12:48] lamb marrying a
[1:12:50] goat this is the same
[1:12:53] species God
[1:12:55] is marrying his own
[1:12:58] kind Hallelujah so that bride has got to
[1:13:01] be both male and female she's got to be
[1:13:03] human and she's got to be God come on
[1:13:07] deity dwells in the Tabernacle of a
[1:13:10] human body let me tell you what we're
[1:13:12] doing we're always focusing on the human
[1:13:14] part oh we're human oh we're human oh
[1:13:16] we're human we're amen I think anybody
[1:13:18] knows you're a human I know you're a
[1:13:20] human and the Bible said even God knows
[1:13:23] you're a human it says it he said even
[1:13:26] God knows the man's only human amen but
[1:13:29] what is a man that God would think of
[1:13:31] him what is a person like you that the
[1:13:34] Bible all the way from the book of
[1:13:35] Genesis to the Book of Revelations that
[1:13:38] you are part of this word because the
[1:13:40] word was with God and the word is in God
[1:13:44] and the word is made flesh in you today
[1:13:48] listen I know it's always a human part
[1:13:50] why couldn't we turn this morning and
[1:13:52] talk about the God part why couldn't we
[1:13:54] talk about the word part that word part
[1:13:57] of you this morning that the Holy Spirit
[1:13:59] has beg to move into you by the new
[1:14:01] birth and gave you the baptism of the
[1:14:03] Holy Ghost I tell you this friend that
[1:14:05] deity dwells in the Church of the Living
[1:14:07] God it is a god part and as the father
[1:14:10] sent me so send I you the god that is in
[1:14:14] Jesus is the same God that has went in
[1:14:17] this
[1:14:18] church now being that this church is
[1:14:22] going to carry his life she's also going
[1:14:24] to produces fruit and brother bam says
[1:14:27] and I'll close here soon and brother
[1:14:29] Bram says it like this he says that
[1:14:31] makes her a bride Tree of
[1:14:35] Life you see it he was the tree of
[1:14:39] life but she's a bride
[1:14:42] Tree of
[1:14:44] Life the same as he bore profit
[1:14:50] fruit so will this bride bear profit
[1:14:53] fruit
[1:14:55] the fruit on her
[1:14:57] branches will not cast but she shall
[1:15:01] bring forth in her season exactly what
[1:15:04] God has
[1:15:05] prophesied Jesus himself brought Matthew
[1:15:08] 27 and Psalms 27 and he brought forth
[1:15:11] even so much to say that he done nothing
[1:15:13] unless his father would show him the
[1:15:15] life that was in the branches was the
[1:15:17] life of God and the fruit that was upon
[1:15:18] his branches were that which was spoken
[1:15:21] of him from prophets before him you
[1:15:23] didn't find any fruit on that tree that
[1:15:26] wasn't prophetic whether it was through
[1:15:29] Malachi or Ezekiel or whether it was
[1:15:31] through Moses it was a it was a it was a
[1:15:34] prophet tree and it only bore Prophet
[1:15:37] fruit what they do with the tree they
[1:15:40] cut it down didn't they and brother R
[1:15:42] said how did they kill it they put it on
[1:15:43] a Roman
[1:15:45] Tree they hung the Tree of Life on a
[1:15:48] Roman Tree yeah he said do you see then
[1:15:52] God planted another tree he planted a
[1:15:55] brid tree on the day of Pentecost yeah
[1:15:58] and he said look how he did it he
[1:15:59] justified it Sanctified it and then he
[1:16:02] filled it with a Holy Ghost and brought
[1:16:03] forth a bride tree he said now what did
[1:16:05] they do with that original
[1:16:07] tree what did the Romans do with the
[1:16:11] bride tree that come from Pentecost
[1:16:13] should have been the tree of life should
[1:16:14] have bore all the fruit but they cut it
[1:16:17] down and how did they do it how did they
[1:16:20] take down the tree of life brother
[1:16:22] Braham said the same way they took down
[1:16:24] the tree of life they took the brid tree
[1:16:26] they hung it on Creeds and Dogma wow he
[1:16:29] said now watch this don't get
[1:16:33] hung and when brother Ram saying it's
[1:16:35] it's a restoration bride tree when
[1:16:36] brother Ram is saying that I thought
[1:16:37] isn't that something how people get
[1:16:41] hung on certain sayings yes they get
[1:16:45] hung up on certain areas yeah and when
[1:16:48] they do it takes the life from the
[1:16:51] tree now what's amazing is is the same
[1:16:55] life that flows through it now that life
[1:16:58] that begins to flow through listen will
[1:17:00] be his life it will be his fruit but
[1:17:03] it's your
[1:17:05] branch for I am the vine and you are the
[1:17:07] branches and he that biteth in him shall
[1:17:09] bring forth much fruit without me you
[1:17:11] can do nothing what will it do it will
[1:17:13] bear the fruit of that day yeah
[1:17:18] see this part of fruit bearing lays
[1:17:21] within the human
[1:17:23] being you can't can't have fruit without
[1:17:26] a bride
[1:17:28] tree you've got to have the female tree
[1:17:31] to have the
[1:17:33] fruit and Jesus said in John
[1:17:36] 15:6 ye didn't choose
[1:17:39] me but I chose
[1:17:42] you and ordained you that you should
[1:17:45] bring forth much
[1:17:47] fruit this should be the bride is the
[1:17:50] tree to bring forth the fruit of God
[1:17:54] that's why he said the bride the word
[1:17:56] would come through in and through that
[1:17:59] bride do you see what it is then there
[1:18:01] is the power of that believing Church it
[1:18:03] is the law of reproduction that brings
[1:18:06] the seed to life it takes the message of
[1:18:09] the hour and brings it into life it
[1:18:11] takes it through the body it's the law
[1:18:14] of reproduction that whenever you lay a
[1:18:16] seed it has to bring forth of its own
[1:18:18] kind and this is a god kind it's there
[1:18:21] the very manifestation of the word would
[1:18:24] be in the life now this word is going to
[1:18:26] work through the bride it's going to
[1:18:28] work in the bride but it would be a
[1:18:30] prophet's
[1:18:31] message yeah you see Jesus was a prophet
[1:18:37] tree so is this bride a prophet
[1:18:40] tree and it will manifest profit fruit
[1:18:44] yeah it will bring forth that word now
[1:18:47] here's the thing folks when you look at
[1:18:49] this and and we we stand here today and
[1:18:52] we look at the systems that is in the
[1:18:54] world and we look look at religion and
[1:18:56] we look at all of the adversity to what
[1:18:58] truth holds in this
[1:19:00] generation I cannot say that there's
[1:19:03] anything less against the church today
[1:19:05] than it was in the days of the first
[1:19:09] church when Joel saw it he saw that it
[1:19:12] was a cankerworm and a caterpillar and a
[1:19:14] bugs and they eat at that tree remember
[1:19:17] it and they eat at that tree until there
[1:19:20] was there was nothing left but a
[1:19:22] stump the same bugs that ate on that
[1:19:26] tree are still
[1:19:29] here but but but the prophet said but
[1:19:31] watch when God be to restore the church
[1:19:35] through justification of Luther when he
[1:19:37] began to bring it out Luther branches
[1:19:39] started out on that tree he said and the
[1:19:42] same insect that attacked the first
[1:19:44] church attacked it again he said but
[1:19:47] this time it only killed the Lutheran
[1:19:49] limb it don't kill the whole tree it
[1:19:52] only kills the limb that it got on the
[1:19:55] Dogma the Creed and the the denomination
[1:19:58] begin to die so let me just say this to
[1:20:00] you the tree itself in this season we'll
[1:20:03] never die amen now somebody can take the
[1:20:06] message and they can go out there and
[1:20:08] death will strike it because they've
[1:20:09] added something to it they they brought
[1:20:11] something on it and and all of the
[1:20:13] sudden they begin to take the life out
[1:20:14] of it and they're sitting out there
[1:20:16] without life and because they have no
[1:20:18] life they believe there is no life let
[1:20:20] me say something to you you know God
[1:20:22] Lives you know God lives right but the
[1:20:25] question is is there a bride that lives
[1:20:28] and I say yes I say she's sitting in
[1:20:31] this building I say she's up from the
[1:20:33] dead I believe that the same life that
[1:20:36] was in Jesus Christ is in the Bride of
[1:20:39] Jesus Christ we know God lives but is
[1:20:42] there a bride that lives is there a
[1:20:45] message that
[1:20:48] lives I say the same insects that
[1:20:50] attacked the early church has attacked
[1:20:52] every church amen but this time there's
[1:20:55] a prophecy laying behind this bride
[1:20:58] church we see it in the Book of Joel I
[1:21:01] shall restore sayith the Lord I shall
[1:21:05] restore sayith the Lord every bug's
[1:21:08] against it but God's going to restore it
[1:21:10] anyhow every bug is attacking it but
[1:21:13] God's going to restore it anyhow you
[1:21:15] know why because prophecy is laying over
[1:21:17] this tree restoration is laying over
[1:21:20] this
[1:21:21] tree God is going to restore it anyhow

[1:21:27] can't stop this
[1:21:31] life you will never stop this
[1:21:35] life it was in the third day that it was
[1:21:38] to come now I'll skip a bunch of
[1:21:39] Prophecy and I'll just say it this it
[1:21:41] was in the third day this was to
[1:21:44] come just like our lord Jesus raised in
[1:21:47] three days the prophecy is there would
[1:21:50] be an Easter for the bride in the third
[1:21:52] day amen y'all know it when Jesus come
[1:21:57] up from the grave some saw him and they
[1:21:59] went around and they said he's alive but
[1:22:02] it was really only a rumor cuz not very
[1:22:05] many people had saw him yeah and when
[1:22:08] this bride began to come alive come
[1:22:11] on Revival struck isua Street yeah and
[1:22:15] Gifts begin to come back in this body by
[1:22:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there
[1:22:19] went a rumor around the world he is
[1:22:22] alive but it's not till the evening of
[1:22:25] the third day when Jesus goes in with
[1:22:28] two disciples and reveals the
[1:22:30] resurrection that they have indicated
[1:22:33] proof he's alive and just the same as
[1:22:36] brother brandom's Ministry was to the
[1:22:38] isua street movement that was the
[1:22:40] morning of the third day his ministry
[1:22:43] was the evening light of the third day
[1:22:45] and the light began to shine oh Church
[1:22:48] of the Living God I I wish I had time to
[1:22:50] build you in these areas but I'll say
[1:22:52] this where does fruit come it comes in
[1:22:54] the top of the tree where does Light
[1:22:57] Strike in the top of the tree where is
[1:23:00] Mount Zion the top of the tree light for
[1:23:03] Resurrection has struck the body to
[1:23:06] mature the life that is laying down in
[1:23:08] there it's a word it's the third hour of
[1:23:10] the day or the third day and it shows a
[1:23:13] manifesting coming forth it was in that
[1:23:16] third day that's when Esther Rose up and
[1:23:19] decided something had to be done right
[1:23:21] it was in that third day when Joshua
[1:23:23] crossed the river Jordan
[1:23:25] it was in that third day that Jesus come
[1:23:27] up from the tomb it was in that third
[1:23:29] day that they sat there on the side of
[1:23:31] the Hill y'all know Tuesday afternoon
[1:23:34] Matthew 24 there was a couple questions
[1:23:37] asked Jesus and Tuesday afternoon the
[1:23:39] third day April the 30th brother bam
[1:23:42] said said that Jesus sat there with the
[1:23:44] disciples in the third day and told them
[1:23:48] the Myster of the
[1:23:50] seals in the third day Matthew 24 if you
[1:23:53] want to follow it's the six seals and
[1:23:56] brother R said but the seven seal ain't
[1:23:57] in
[1:23:58] there somebody said then what is the
[1:24:01] seven seal well he was the one talking
[1:24:03] yeah yeah there you go he wasn't one of
[1:24:05] The Parables he was the one talking yeah
[1:24:08] he was the one revealing the six seals
[1:24:12] what was it it was the word becoming
[1:24:15] unveiled on the third day we're living
[1:24:19] in the
[1:24:20] evening of the third day amen look at
[1:24:23] the world in the shape it's again
[1:24:25] yeah but there's something here to
[1:24:28] restore
[1:24:30] amen there's something here to
[1:24:35] restore there is
[1:24:38] nothing that can stop
[1:24:41] it God said I shall restore
[1:24:46] amen do you know David saying of this
[1:24:51] church he said she's like a tree
[1:24:55] planted by the
[1:24:59] water it's amazing to me that David and
[1:25:02] Joel see the same
[1:25:05] tree and then in Psalms 2 I'll get to
[1:25:07] Psalms one next week in Psalms 2 it's
[1:25:09] amazing because then David said why did
[1:25:11] the wicked
[1:25:13] rage why did the wicked
[1:25:16] rage they could not break the cords of
[1:25:19] Prophecy connected to Jesus they put him
[1:25:22] in the grave but three days he'd come
[1:25:23] out
[1:25:25] yeah why does a wicked rage today
[1:25:27] against against the church you can put
[1:25:29] her in the grave but she come out right
[1:25:32] because prophecy's laying there you
[1:25:34] can't stop it right sin
[1:25:38] tried you know many of you sitting here
[1:25:41] today sin
[1:25:42] tried I was just reminded our music
[1:25:45] players will come sin
[1:25:49] tried I just reminded today as I was
[1:25:52] sitting there this morning I was
[1:25:53] thinking about these things
[1:25:55] and I thought about that third day
[1:25:58] and was thinking about what God does on
[1:26:00] the third day you know and I remember
[1:26:03] the story brother brandom had been
[1:26:06] flying he'
[1:26:07] been crossing over Memphis Tennessee he
[1:26:11] said the plane had a little trouble and
[1:26:12] he had to land he said said they put me
[1:26:15] up I've been there to that little hotel
[1:26:18] it's real nice he put me the peab
[1:26:20] body he said the next morning I woke up
[1:26:23] and he said had some letters I wanted to
[1:26:25] mail he said so I just went down there
[1:26:26] to mail some letters and he said as I
[1:26:29] was walking down there I had a plane to
[1:26:30] catch and I was needing to go and he
[1:26:32] said I started walking he said all of a
[1:26:35] sudden something started leading
[1:26:37] me he said I started singing a little
[1:26:39] song I'm one of them and he said I
[1:26:42] started following the spirit he said
[1:26:43] after a little while I got down the
[1:26:44] colored side of town
[1:26:46] and he said I started walking and kept
[1:26:48] walking he said after a little while he
[1:26:51] said I looked over and there was a lady
[1:26:52] standing there
[1:26:54] he said she was standing there with Dew
[1:26:56] on her head standing at the
[1:26:58] gate he said' when I saw her she said
[1:27:01] good morning
[1:27:04] Parson he said
[1:27:07] well how' you know I was a
[1:27:10] Parson I I've often thought about this
[1:27:12] how many times had brother Brown told
[1:27:15] people who they were
[1:27:17] yeah this
[1:27:20] time she was telling him
[1:27:24] she didn't know his name William brandom
[1:27:26] because he says uh well I'm I'm I'm
[1:27:27] William brandom she saids do you know me
[1:27:29] she said
[1:27:30] no well then how do you know I'm a
[1:27:33] Parson well cuz I see I'm like a woman
[1:27:36] in the Bible who was a shite didn't have
[1:27:38] a child and yeah she said and God gave
[1:27:41] her one and child died and said that
[1:27:44] woman ran to Elijah and seek
[1:27:48] Resurrection she said I told the Lord I
[1:27:50] said Lord I'm like that woman but where
[1:27:53] is you're
[1:27:55] Elijah and she said Parson I seen you
[1:27:58] coming down the
[1:27:59] road well I'll tell you what to many it
[1:28:02] was just we brand him to that
[1:28:04] woman that was
[1:28:07] Elijah he said Well ma'am what's
[1:28:10] happened and she said well I got this
[1:28:11] boy said he got out and I raised him
[1:28:14] right I raised him right said but he got
[1:28:17] out in this world and said he got to a
[1:28:18] fool in around he got into sexual sin
[1:28:22] brother Bram later tells us it was
[1:28:23] syphus and the boy had contacted a
[1:28:25] disease and hadn't uh I don't even know
[1:28:27] if there is cure I don't know much about
[1:28:29] it but but he wasn't he wasn't able to
[1:28:31] be helped and that sin had got into his
[1:28:36] heart and she W look took brother
[1:28:39] brandom in there and she said brother B
[1:28:41] said well I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a Divine
[1:28:42] healer I I have healing campaigns all
[1:28:44] over the world maybe I could pray with
[1:28:46] him and she said well let's go in she
[1:28:48] Saidi really more interested in his soul
[1:28:50] persons he said I went there and stood
[1:28:52] over him and I said now tell me what it
[1:28:55] what it was he saidwell he's been laying
[1:28:56] here for the last hours and all he'll
[1:29:00] say is it's dark Mama it's dark said
[1:29:02] he's floating on this floating on this
[1:29:04] boat and he's out in this lost in this
[1:29:07] sea and all he's saying it's dark Mama
[1:29:08] it's
[1:29:10] dark brother BR said how long's he been
[1:29:12] this way she said for about three days
[1:29:17] Parson oh that struck
[1:29:20] me three
[1:29:22] days he's been laying there with that
[1:29:24] heart problem over
[1:29:28] sin he said you go ahead and pray mama
[1:29:31] and when Mama began to pray he said all
[1:29:33] I could tell she talked to the Lord
[1:29:36] before he said after she got done
[1:29:38] praying he said I just reached over on
[1:29:40] my hands on her the boy and just begin
[1:29:43] to pray and he said just when I started
[1:29:46] to pray he said he cried out it's
[1:29:50] getting light
[1:29:51] Mama it's getting light am amen and I
[1:29:55] thought oh what a
[1:29:56] representation of a third
[1:29:59] day amen when an Elijah come into this
[1:30:02] age and people's hearts were sin sick
[1:30:05] and because of sin and immoralities and
[1:30:09] Troubles of every kind Hearts troubled
[1:30:11] at every kind but God had a
[1:30:14] remedy he sent an
[1:30:16] Elijah he said he would turn our hearts
[1:30:19] back to restore
[1:30:22] us see this is is the third
[1:30:25] day the light has
[1:30:28] come the light that would restore the
[1:30:31] bride to her former position would you
[1:30:33] stand with us this
[1:30:38] morning maybe the Lord's dealing with
[1:30:40] your heart this
[1:30:45] morning do you see the thing of it
[1:30:49] is that the real trouble of our age is
[1:30:52] heart trouble
[1:30:55] Jesus says not what a man takes in his
[1:30:57] body it's what comes out of
[1:31:01] him you could close every alcohol
[1:31:04] business in the
[1:31:06] world if it wasn't in a man's heart to
[1:31:09] drink yeah sure because they would go
[1:31:13] broke yeah if nobody had desire to smoke
[1:31:17] or had no desire for sin right there
[1:31:20] would be no there would be no reason to
[1:31:21] have it because there would be nobody to
[1:31:23] consume it
[1:31:26] yeah but it's the
[1:31:28] heart
[1:31:30] right it's amazing to me that it was the
[1:31:33] third day the
[1:31:35] prophecy that the bride would restore
[1:31:37] again and Jesus in the Le oysa age said
[1:31:40] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[1:31:44] if any man would open up his heart that
[1:31:47] I would come in and I would Su with him
[1:31:51] this would be a heart changing message
[1:31:55] the message of William Brandon would
[1:31:56] change Hearts right it's a light that
[1:31:59] reaches to the depth of the heart and
[1:32:01] change his Hearts yeah many of you
[1:32:04] sitting here this morning I I was just
[1:32:06] trying to go over some things in my mind
[1:32:08] of of events and people and things and I
[1:32:11] was thinking all the way back brother
[1:32:13] Josh when you brought
[1:32:15] Johnny so long
[1:32:18] ago he was in our Bible study there
[1:32:20] Friday night and he was just talking and
[1:32:22] all a sudden my mind went back yeah they
[1:32:25] just a young man showed up with skull in
[1:32:27] his front pocket he wanted to meet the
[1:32:28] god that that man was talking
[1:32:31] about but see it was the third
[1:32:34] day amen and there was a message that
[1:32:37] can turn a heart
[1:32:39] amen thank you Lord isn't it
[1:32:41] amazing that the Holy Spirit could so
[1:32:45] uniquely lay things
[1:32:47] together yeah that he could have us all
[1:32:50] here at a certain moment yeah amen and
[1:32:54] have a message that could deal with our
[1:32:55] heart I wonder this morning when our
[1:32:57] hearts
[1:33:01] bowed our Elijah has brought a
[1:33:07] message to change Hearts I wonder this
[1:33:12] morning would you like to let Jesus in
