========================================

um in the book of Ephesians uh we want to take uh for reading Ephesians chapter 1 I want to read those first four verses and I'm not going to be able to of course do justice to this as I read it but I'm just going to read it and then we're going to speak about it in Ephesians chapter 1 and one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ but the will of God and to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus now Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ and blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love and I'm just going to add this next verse having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the pleasure of his will we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated this morning I want to uh just travel here in this uh portion of scripture and I'm going to be uh speaking uh uh generally uh about some of this as well as detailed maybe but uh I'm I'm uh you know me I'm not all together teacher I'm more preacher probably than teacher so uh when the anointing comes it just starts putting things together a little better for me you know and and it's such a blessing it's good to have brother gourd here this morning God bless you brother gour a dear friend of ours from Saskatoon area there and amen uh we certainly good to see you today and we're uh we're going to be taking in this book of Ephesians and I just want to speak here in this second part and I I want to maybe to say that I think it's a powerful uh time that we're living and the book of Ephesians is something that is very uh it's very relevant to the time we're living as a prophet would say it he would tell us this that the book of Ephesians is the greatest book of the New Testament and he says because it actually parallels that of Joshua of the Old Testament which was where brother Bram says Calvinism and armenis arism is going to run together it's where it's going to meet and it's going to bring a balance into the teaching uh this is where that it's going to bring balance into lives and and if it it parallels of course the Old Testament Joshua then it speaks of how that when the children of Israel receiving promise had crossed the Jordan River amen which was a type of the Holy Ghost and when they crossed the Jordan River and they got on the other side they didn't sit down on the banks but rather they were directed into portions of that land according to the calling of God upon their lives which had been for ordained by their mother mothers even in their in their ordination of hundreds of years before they was born their forefathers their names were placing them in there and Joshua caught that inspiration and would begin to place them in those same places by the grace of God and and showing that for thetion of course is what Paul is doing with the New Testament Church and he's saying now that we've crossed into the Holy Ghost now we're not just going to sit on the banks of the Jordan or just say we got the Holy Ghost but it's going to be doing something the holy spirit is going to give us inheritance it's going to place us it's going to put us in those positions where God had been with of course this is a type of Joshua going into the Canaan land and the Canaan land does not really type Heaven the Canaan land is a type of the Overcomer how they're overcoming in their lives and and of course there's battles amen and if somebody ever tells you would you get the Holy Ghost the battle's over well now the battle is over of whether you're saved or not but the battle with your enemy has just begun amen and if you're thinking that everything's just going to be wonderful and there's no hindrances well somebody sold you the wrong gospel because the gospel of the Salvation the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen is a is a gospel that we're fighting a real enemy amen but we're going to overcome I I love the Bible don't you and we're going to overcome amen now this Canan does not represent the Millennium it represents the Overcomer and and so we recognize then that we're coming out of and we're going into now I look at this age that we're living mostly the church that we're speaking to is a going into Stage we're not really coming out of denominations or coming out of things but rather we're more going into something is where our emphasis usually lies on going into the promises because of where we are positionally as a church and and you can feel however you feel but I'll tell you how I feel amen I'm speaking to an adopted Church of people who knows their positions our our leadership is in position our our songs are in position our deacons are in positions our people are in positions you see positioned in the power of the holy spirit amen under Authority that comes from God now uh now somebody say well brother why a't everybody no I'm talking about the church but I'll say this individuals Within the church as well have found their adoption now I can say that to you because I know the Harvest season's on right now amen and there's one thing we found out about a harvest not every plant comes to maturity at the same time but some of the field is in maturity why others are still maturing but you can't disassociate and say that it's not part of that field is not mature because part of it really is amen and you're not waiting on the mature part you're waiting on the part that's not mature but if you let the sun shine just a little while longer amen the rest of us will catch up amen it's going to there there's a catching up Amen in the in the quick work of God in this end time now this is what we're looking at as a new testament believer we're believing in a Land Of Promise of the spirit of God now this this this what I'm teaching this morning what Paul is teaching this is not for babies this is not for the outside world in other words this is not an Evangelical sermon per se amen or Evangelical book this book is to Believers Ephesians is to Believers it is a going into what you have been positioned or what you have been saved for now not for grown-ups brother Ram says but watch it to the faithful who are in Christ Jesus not to Sinners babies but to them that are grown up remember Paul saying I have some things to say but really I can't say them now he said but he but he did say but I'd like to talk about milk kind ack and I I'd like to say these things he said but but you have need of milk he said but but mature people have a that they're able to take strong meat amen so MDC was considered strong meat right mcdc was considered strong meat so Paul wasn't saying amen that not everybody could take something or nor am I speaking to this church this morning saying that you're a bunch of babies needing milk but rather to the age that the age of Paul he wasn't able to teach the things he wanted to teach then but he knew there was a harvest coming a mature church and adopted people would come in the end time to receive mature teaching now isn't it amazing Paul only meets mecdc talks to MDC just a little bit amen but when brother bandam comes along he makes entire sermons called MDC the great priest king then he comes in and speaks on who is this mdic because it become the season of meat it become the season amen and y'all know this amen that that all the all the anointings of the ages they were Earthbound wasn't they and all of them start on milk but the eagle age is an age of meat eaters it's never milk even the babies in the eagles eat the meat amen because that's what the father does he feeds them the meat this is the age amen of of meat this is the age amen of strong meat that belongs to the Church of the Living God and some things are so strong they're little hard to swallow so this isn't to everybody it's to Abraham's seed right and we proved that heavily Thursday night this isn't to everybody this is to Abraham's seed so if it seems so far stretched it might not be for some people but it's for Abraham's seed amen it's for those that can take it now brother bradam himself had the ministry of Joshua to position the church and if you go back and you find amen pick up your pen and write there spoken word Original Seed then in the church age book you'll hear brother randam say that that that that Joshua represents the end time messenger and Caleb represents the believer of that end time messenger amen so we find out then that Joshua was the one leading them into the promises he was there positionally placing them like Ephesians does US promises that were given that must be fought for promises that's not just going to the devil's not just going to lay down and let you receive these things that God has promised you're going to have to fight for these things it's not just going to be amen that the devil's going to roll up the curtain said y'all come on in get all these promises and take this land no he's going to do everything he can to prevent you from coming to the maturity of receiving the promises that you have been foreordained to take according to the word of God amen this is a time as it was in Joshua when they fought the great Kings when when the Kings started coming together to fight against Joshua it was in that stage even that Joshua exercised great Authority and power for possession of his land that's when Joshua a man told the son to stand still he could do that because he was going to take what belonged to him amen and when you get ready to take what belongs to you you'll find out you're serving a supernatural God and the god that gave it to you has the ability to help you receive it he's not a God that can just be overrun or he's not a God that we just have to lay down and take whatever the enemy puts upon us but as Sons and Daughters of God we have an authority that when it belongs to us we can stand with the god-given rights and say this belongs to me and if we got to make the sun stand still brother there's a power in the Church of the Living God that can make the sun stand still amen now I I can give it to you in the scripture if you want to see it it'll make the sun stand still it's it's a power that God give the church now it was in the greatest battle ever fought wasn't it amen it was in the Battle of Joshua for the promises of God and kings were conglomerating against him amen other words they were they were forming unions against him to keep him out of them promises when he told that son to stand still do you see where we are in the end time is the greatest battle that has ever been fought is fighting now now when did that battle begin brother Ram says in greatest battle ever fought it's about to begin now because the seals were going to be opened and when the seals were opened it was revealing Redemptive rights of the Church of the Living God and when you got ready to take your rights the enemy said no you can't have these rights amen but God who is rich in Mercy knew that Darkness was settling upon the Earth but he sent a messenger in the earth to speak the word of God and the spoken word became light at the time that when the when the when the very time itself stand still and there we are fighting under the light of the evening message what is it it's a positive thing tonight this morning it's a positive thing it's the it's a position of the church to be in the right position it takes a complete understanding positionally of who you are teaching positions the church that's right teaching positions the church now y'all heard me Thursday I don't believe amen just in just in a a in a icle teaching I don't believe in just dry theology but teaching positions the church because teaching breaks open the word and shows you positionally what is yours what belongs to you and the power behind it to take it from the devil who's trying to keep it from the church now see what it is Hope turns to Faith and when Faith Comes it already belongs to you do you see the difference many people are hoping today that they can be healed that they can be saved they hope that something's going to happen but you see faith is different in that is Faith believes that it's already there faith is believing it's already settled then we find out I'm not hoping I'm going to be a son faith says I'm already a son hoping is not I'm going to be sealed with the Holy Ghost faith says I'm already sealed amen come on Church When Faith takes a hold faith will stop the devil in his tracks because brother R said faith has muscles Faith knows where it's at faith has hair on his chest Faith don't have to ask nobody Faith already knows and in the hour We're living the Bible said that the Faith of Our Fathers would be restored back to the Church of the Living God faith amen Faith to believe there's a God when you don't see it when you don't feel it when you don't hear it now now there's laws and and and one of those laws I just touch it here this law the law of electricity heyen would it be something if you come in this morning Brian started to flip on the light and the light don't come on you wouldn't have left church and said there's no such thing as electricity you would be hunting with what's wrong with the electricity you be looking at the breaker You' be looking at the wiring did you pay the light bill amen because you're not going to if it don't work you're not going to say oh there must be no electricity on but you're going to be saying I don't know why the electricity ain't working here and we find out that sometimes when people come to places in their lives they start saying well is there really a god or is there really but that shouldn't be the question the question should be what could we do to get the god that we know is alive and real into my situation there's a way to get electricity in this building there is a way to get the god of Heaven in your situations amen if you want him in your finances bring him into your finances if you want him in your marriage bring him in your marriage if you want him in your church bring him in your church the Bible said I stand at the door and knock and if any man will open I will come unto him the Bible says if you resist the devil he will res he will flee from you if you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you if you want him involved then invite him into your situation to Lord Jesus I don't know what to do with this come on and get in this situation because when you get God involved he is an omnipotent force that can change the situations whatever is it going along ever presentes water from the rock I love how brother Bram says this he said the power that's in the church now we're talking about positioning the power that's in the church now now is controlled by a law the law is a law of Faith it's not keeping Commandments listen to that it's not keeping Commandments it's a law of faith and all things are possible to them that believe in my law this morning all things are possible to a Believer the law of faith says if you can believe it it's possible this morning you said well brother I I don't know about this situation I listen if you can believe it it's possible this morning because the law says all things are possible to them that believe that's right all things are possible if you can believe it now this is a powerful quote this should be on your refrigerator if it's not and if you can believe it whatever God leads your soul to believe that is yours see God leads your soul to believe every place The Souls of your foot can set upon God gives it to you it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to the law faith will open it up for you now watch every place every place that you put your foot do you see there in Joshua every place be strong and of good courage don't be discouraged amen I have given you the land but how are they going to take it they wasn't taking Israel at Palestine at that time they wasn't taken it at one time they took it 6 Ines at a time they took a step and they possessed that land they were on if they had to fight for it and then they took another step and they took another step and sometimes when you look at the situations that are in your life or in the Amen in in your in your area or whatever that Fellowship you're in and you look at that and and you say I I don't know how that's ever going to change well I tell you it can change 6 Ines at a time because if you can take a step now what does that mean it means God leads your heart to believe do you know the beauty of absolutes we all need absolutes don't we absolutes lead to Paradox if you have an absolute it leads you to a paradox in other words when God said cross this Jordan I have given you this land there was the absolute but the Paradox is how can we take a land when they're bigger than us and they're meaner than us and they're amen they're trained men how can we do it who cares how we're going to do it we can do it because God said we can do it so there's an absolute that is laying over every Paradox in our life if God leads you to it you can do it if God leads you to it you can do it now how will God lead he leads by his word is that right God leads by his word it leads to Paradox uh I wouldn't have a lot of time to go here but I'll say this whatever God leads you to believe do you see if he leads you to believe something by his word then whatever the word says you can do that you can do because he leads you every place the souls your foot set God gives you that amen then you can have it I love the bottom part of this quote brother Ram says it like this as much Faith as we be released that's how much much power you can have because in you dwells power to make heavens and earth and God dwells in you and your sons and daughters of God there you are it's your faith it's according to your faith it's according to your faith now I believe God is leading the church to Mountain Moving faith amen I believe there's challenges going on in your life because God has led you to that challenge knowing that he's put something in you that you can make it move out of your way come on church that Red Sea didn't get up and get in the way of Israel God LED them to the Red Sea because God was with them and knew that he could cause a way for them to go through when there was no way I tell you what brother Christopher tell you what the prophet said he said God led him there for a purpose he said it was to prove by Moses and that and those people that God Will Make A Way when there is no way hallu that's why they went through that because God can challenge the situation and there's situations going on in lives across this room this morning but I'll say this Heen I believe God's leading us and if God's leading us he knew we were coming to this place then he put put something in you that you can speak to the mountain in front of you you can speak to the challenge in front of you and you say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about Gentile Authority I'm talking about a positioned believer that knows who he is that knows where he's standing knows where he's going this belongs to me Satan is in my way get out of my way Satan it's my possession it's my inheritance I don't care if it's a wall I don't care if it's a Red Sea I don't care what the problem is there's a God here this morning to back up the word of God and make every mountain move yes sir amen the prophet of God said there must come an Ephesians to this in the in God who is rich in Mercy coming out of going into watch what he says there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine Faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind you yeah and enter into Faith enter into Faith isn't that something how do I get into Faith how do I step in you led into Faith by the word of God faith cometh by the hearing and the hearing of the word of God if the word says you can do it there's your leadership to do it come on if the word says you're able I say we're more than able because there's your leadership we are leading by the word of God come on Friends y'all know I'm telling you the truth this little church is not led by dreams and Visions we don't go down amen and come up could you imagine if every Sunday if I come up here and said well I had a dream and we are to go this way yeah can you imagine how that would begin to feel amen you'd be like this one week amen he had a good dream next week he had a bad matter of fact somebody come to me one time and told me said I had a bad dream about you I said well would you go back and dream another one for me I don't want to hear a bad dream I want you prophesying over my life some negative something and I got to lay awake at night and wonder what it meant and how it meant if you know people talking about me don't tell me that I could care less I want to know what the word of God says about me I want to know what a prophet spoke over my life and he spoke blessing he spoke healing he spoke truth it's a positive faith on a positive word and I believe the Church of the Living God can press through it I believe it can press through every enemy that's the truth we find out watch this we find out he've got to come another Ephesians an Ephesus to this there's got to come an Ephesians of this journey of all Journeys there's an Ephesians to it you're on a journey and you take off and you and you're coming from a certain place there's a leaving and and but when you're when you're arriving ain't like when you're leaving and and and most people want to make the message today like it was when we were leaving they want to take us back there when we were leaving back from that day and how it happened and what do amen that was when we were leaving we're in another hour We're arriving in the promises of God and there's a generation here maybe that didn't even start with the leaving amen but here they are on the arriving side and amen the power of God is just as real today as it ever was do you see what it is it's the it's it's the arrival or the entrance into it's a different type of time now watch the book was sealed brother B said Seven Seals in the last day Revelations 10 said we would find out the L out to sea of the last messenger during the time of his prophecies the Seven Seals would be opened now that's Revelation 10th chapter if you want to read that he said and we're promised according to Revelations 10 and Malachi 4 and St Luke that there would come an Ephesians to this there must come an Ephesians the Sevenfold mystery of the word of God must be unfolded the unfolding of the word is one thing but the church has got to go into the word that was unfolded and I believe right down in the shadows of the coming of the Lord as Joshua just before the Ephesians raised up John the Baptist raised up before the next Ephesians and we're promised another Ephesians and it's predicted here in the scripture therefore I think we are living in the Ephesians again amen we're living in the Ephesians again amen what is that Ephesians we will receive an understanding isn't that amazing that a prophet's going to lay Ephesians over understanding in other words amen we're not moving into a physical land we're not going to step it's not a physical land we're dealing with it is a spiritual land and spiritual Authority comes from understanding now church I mean I I tell you when the seals were opened you didn't know who you were but as you begin to know who you are you know what belongs to you and the clearer it is who you are the clearing is what belongs to you and here we are with the clarity of the word in the last days you you you Elders know what I'm talking about when you first come into the message they couldn't figure out if the seven seal was open or not well there ain't a sermon like that preached at all anymore not at least Among Us there's not even a suggestion that it couldn't be open as's a Clarity here for our young people that wasn't here when I first come in this message in the in the '90s I remember hitting the field and the biggest argument in the field seven seal was open seven seal was closed funny thing is I had already read the prophet without all the ideas and the prophet of God said it was the opening of Seven Seals that's right so I just believed it and it was so much easier because I didn't have to comb through all those things had an understanding could just come upon my life do you see what it is the availability you don't have to be an elder in the message to get an understanding of what God is doing because we're further down the road now than we were 40 years ago come on young people this is a season of the generation of God to pick up this word and begin to believe this word we're not trying to come through well whether is it one God or is there two Gods come on that stuff settled is there a Prophet coming or is there not a prophet coming listen it's a settled matter we are not here debating whether there's a prophet or not a prophet of course there's a prophet if you believe your Bible you would have to believe that so I'm not trying to tell the world a prophet is here I'm trying to tell the world what a prophet said and not what he said about Rome and not what he said about Russia but what he said about the bride it affects me what did he say about me what is the prophecies over my life where am I going to live what am I going to do what is my [Music] inheritance got a titled need to it my name has been spoken over it and wherever you can put your foot whatever you can believe it belongs to you it's an Ephesian and we're here it's what brother Bram said and we're here now it's amazing to me when you start when you start Landing in those heavenly places in Christ when you take the seat that belongs to you when you're seated in the right place if you try to take something that's not your it won't work right but when you're seated there by God yes it's something alltogether different am now now I say that watch watch how watch how the scripture says we're blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places brother BR says Heavenly places is position it's your position in the word now how can you be the bride and not be a part of that word but you got to know what part of the word you are see build an ark that's the word but not our part amen put a blood streak over the door that's the word but not our part you got to know what part of the word you are now first first Thessalonians chapter 4 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout not my part but he would have a voice there's your part that there would be a voice of the Resurrection now I'm talking about Joshua folks he placed every messenger and placed every Age first guy that ever did it he laid it out and said he was here and he was here and he was here and he was here and then he looks at the bride and says you're the final voice to the final age so the same one that placed Paul over the Ephesians that put Luther over his age put you and I as the voice of the Resurrection placed Us in the Rapture that's why I'm not falling apart this morning with all the things that are happening in the East if you're an unwise virgin your time's coming but for the wise virgin she sees her signs her lamps trimmed her Fire's burning she's eating her food with her shoes on her feet and her staff in her hand cuz she knows it's going on time he I'm going [Applause] [Music] home if you don't have that you you you you you you might want to look at things now they're coming to a land the prophet has said in adoption part two they're coming to a land where they're going to get settled down they're going to rest they're going to plant a little corn have Vineyards and they'll eat from their Vineyards he says then we'll leave it to our children you know some of you are right in that stage right now where either you're enjoying what was left to you or you're building something to leave to someone yeah it's just uh there's some talk going on I know brother brother Aiden's doing some moving around right now because he's starting phasing out and leaving something here behind him and but you know wouldn't it be would it it be horrible if you didn't have something to leave or if you didn't have somebody to leave it too you imagine working your whole life and building something and then there's no one to enjoy what's behind it it it but fear not it's the father's Good Will to give to you to leave to you the kingdom now here's the beauty is that we we we leave it to our children now here's the thing in paragraph 16 adoption part two he says it was a great thing that inheritance is inheritance in a land that no one else but a close Kinsman could redeem The Inheritance now let me drop a little token here that I touched on the other night to your mothers this is powerful now how many here has ever prayed for a lost loved one he asked it I want to ask it he says listen that's your inheritance now we're we're this is Joshua folks and this ain't to everybody but to them that were under him it was a positioning of what belongs to them now watch him lay that belonging to you as an inheritance he says now watch this amen he carries this now now the reason he gets into this is a woman in adoption part one I'll just give you a brief he adoption part one a woman comes in the prayer line brother R praying for people praying for people and he comes to the last one he said because you're the last one I'm going to do some teaching here and then he starts teaching on what it means to pray for your children so on adoption part two he comes back picks it up and he says see this inheritance of these children brother Eric this inheritance of these children he said let me drop a little token here I touched the other night mothers amen how many here ever pray for a lost loved one Paul told the Roman believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thine house shall be saved now if you got faith enough for your own self to be saved have faith enough no matter how wavered the boy is or how wavered the girl is they'll be saved anyhow somehow if he has to lay them on a black if they have to lay in a hospital die they'll be saved God promised it it's an inheritance they shall be there I'll read it to you from Isaiah they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth trouble for their seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them and the prophet of God took it to the book of Isaiah and said God has made a promise to the believer they Offspring with them now now there's a that's that's theologically uh uh troubling for some people but see it's also theologically trouble for people to believe Matthew 25 that some people could even be in heaven without a birth yeah yeah I know I know amen theologically they're having a hard time with it but the prophet of God said somebody could give you a cup of cold water and Jesus said it wouldn't go without reward come on Church how powerful is your blood how powerful is your god I tell you he's powerful enough that he's Sovereign and he can do what he wants to and how he wants to and he can save who he wants to cuz he's God and there is nobody beside him to csel him or tell him he's done wrong the prophet said they'd be there without of birth he said granted eternal life because they were good to their brethen it's in the word of God somebody said well they in the bride I don't know how they fit amen he just said they' be there well I tell you glory to God I Think It's Shouting Time To Know amen that we don't live by law we live by the grace of God and the same Grace that come into your life is the same Grace here this morning to change all kinds of Hearts it's a powerful it's a powerful section amen Ephesians parallels Joshua right when you cross the Jordan the first battle that happened was Jericho but in e in Joshua chapter 2 before they ever crossed the river spies went over and found rahab's house y'all know the story they found rahab's house and remember amen Rahab took in The Messengers and hid them from being destroyed and the minute she got them in the house she started on them and she said we know your God and we've heard about your God and we fear and tremble at the hearing of your God cuz we knows what he can do and she said now they seek your life lives but I'll hide you man it's powerful isn't it she knew what to do with the word she just knew what to do with them she knew how to she knew how to preserve her own life by the Messengers God sent her she could have just said hey I'm scared and put them outside the but she would have never got what she got had she did that but when she received the messengers she was receiving the word of faith that would change her whole life and not just her life life the life of her family now it's a it's a powerful you can go over and read it and you can see how that when when she hit them amen that when they got ready to leave she told them the story of what she would tell and how they could go and when she got ready she said but listen I require of you something I want a token from you I want a true token now I want a token from you that whenever this place is destroyed that my life will be saved give me some kindness and when she said that to them they said look now amen the very cord you're letting us down with this scarlet cord amen take this cord and when Joshua comes hang it out the window and th and thy house whoever you can get under this is going to be saved and it will not be judgment upon them now now listen I I'm I love to read my Bible and when I read Joshua 2 I see this great promise I see a promise because you know what I'm seeing here Jaden I see that they ask her what do you want and she said I tell you what I really want I want the salvation of my mom and my dad and my family she didn't have children but had she had children she would have said and my children so she didn't even have children but she's claiming family without even having a child under the token of the Lord and when she says this what do you want now Sister bar what she's revealing is her desire right and that and would that be your desire come on would that be your desire do you see that would that be your desire now the beautiful thing is when you have a desire you got to know where that comes from when you have a desire it's got somewhere it came from and watch this woman when she's told them her desire they made her desire a promise and it switched from being what she wanted to what she had as a promise and you might have always wanted your children you wanted your family but your desire has became a promise when a prophet of God said lay the to over them and they'll be saved it's not just my desire it's a promise of the Holy Ghost and if you go on and read Joshua am me just read a couple verses later in Joshua chapter 6 and you'll see the reality that whenever that whenever Joshua come he was a he was an Avenger and he was there to judge he was there as a judge to tear down the walls of Jericho but she didn't come under judgment she was under a token so when she looked out the window she didn't see what the rest of Jericho saw they saw judgment and destruction and the end and she saw opportunity and she saw deliverance and she saw I'm leaving this place because I've got a token what window see she looks out of Made A Difference by the promise she had Joshua chapter 6 says she was saved and her parents was saved and all that was under it was saved so it turned from desire to promise to reality desire promise reality some of you are in the promised stage but some of you know the reality of it already now can I move into the New Testament with it acts the 16th chapter Paul this man who's writing the Ephesians he he stirred things up a bit maybe he wasn't uh maybe he wasn't the uh he didn't just go through town without a mixup you know he always had things stirred up you know he he goes in here in Acts 16 and he's preaching and there's this woman following him and after a while he cast The Demon out of her and the Bible said when her master saw that they couldn't get any more reward from her it wouldn't going to make any more money by her because of this Paul man that they sought to beat him yeah and put him in prison yeah so it was accusations it wasn't honest right but they got it they put him in prison and they had silent with him there and the Bible said at midnight Paul and Silas began to sing praises unto the Lord and the prisoners heard him and suddenly there was a great earthquake and the foundations of the prison were shaken immediately all the doors opened and everyone's bands was loosed wonder what kind of song they were singing and The Keeper of the prison Awakening out of his sleep seeing the prison doors open Drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing the prisoners had been fled yeah but Paul cried with a voice saying do thyself no harm we are all here and then he called for a light oh I'm so glad when the light shows up in the dark places and then he calls for a light and it sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out sir what must I do to be saved he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved in thine house and they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to they that were in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and baptized and all this straight away look at this this wasn't a six-month period the man heard the gospel and him and his house got baptized because he knew he was hearing truth powerful thing right they were right there they were the prophet of God said there they they were in that jail he said now remember this is the days of lepers and everything and they're laying on concrete floors and their food and their water and the conditions must have been a hard thing they've been beat the Bible said beat and cast into prison I'm sure they wasn't feeding them good they wasn't washing their clothes they didn't look like clergy at all they wouldn't have looked like clergy they wouldn't have looked like men respected they wasn't wearing a nice suit and clean clothes in a nice car they were in the bottom in the inner part of the jail the Bible says and they were they were right there beating and chained in stocks so the man who was watching them maybe he didn't even know why they were there but he heard them down there singing might have got on their nerves I don't know but brother man said they were singing some good gospel songs he said one place he said maybe it was Power in the Blood don't you know it was wonderwork in power he said maybe they were singing I love him he said but at midnight they were praising God in this kind of condition does that teach us something it matters the atmosphere can be built anywhere it does not matter the room you're in atmosphere can be built anywhere they were building an atmosphere in the innermost part of the jail and they started amen I I I've studied a study one time years ago that said even when people walk across the bridge they make them walk out of Step because they're afraid if they getting the right step that the unity of the vibrations will break bridges down and you can imagine the harmony that must have been in that room that day when they started making Harmony and Paul and Silas started singing amen and the Angel Band started joining in and there was a Harmony and vibrations begin to happen Revival begin to break out brother the walls of the jail housee Begin to Fall I tell you what I'd like to have a worship service like that today wouldn't you amen to when you get to praising the Lord amen till the walls of your prison begins to break away the stocks and the bonds I know good Christian people amen that are under problems right now it's like a prison house to them but I don't care what kind of problem you're in you can sing you can sing and you can praise you can praise God anyhow I tell you what we ought to do this morning we are to take a moment and thank God we are to thank him for the beautiful place for the hour for the days we are to thank him for our families we are to thank him for the Holy Ghost we are to praise him for it amen we're not in that kind of condition but we can praise God [Applause] anyhow and the walls begin to fall and they begin to shake the walls of that prison house I tell you this morning I feel some walls shaking right now I tell you what I tell the devil I give you fair warning devil you better get back cuz your kingdom is coming down when the saints of God begin to work worship God it doesn't matter the condition they're in the praise of God will change the situation and it'll open doors where there is no [Applause] doors was dark down there brother Noah it was dark in that room and they were Chained and they were barred but you can't bar a man from his praise Jonah was in the belly of a well Brother David he could still praise God when they begin to praise the walls walls started coming down the Walls actually fell and when those walls fail look at what happens this man in darkness he thinks I've lost my prisoners now he's in darkness I've lost the prisoners I can't there's nothing I can do yeah out of the darkness soldja boy you w't take your life sir out of the darkness so boy Hallelujah you won't take your life you see that you may be in the darkest hour but Paul was not subject to the darkness Paul was not subject to the fear of that Roman Jailer he was a free man no matter how much bonds he was in no matter how dark it was he was living in light and I'll tell you this a real Son of God you can put him in the worst conditions you can put him in the worst trouble but he's never subject to it I know what I'm talking about when you preach the gospel you can't be subject to the problems that's going on I know what I'm talking about you get people in great troubles in their homes and in their families and if we get subject to it you have no hopes amen but we don't get subject to it we stand in a position of knowing that if God gets in the situation walls are going to fall bars are going to [Music] break we're all here no worry don't worry don't don't don't take your life it's it'll be okay don't kill yourself and Paul calls for light now it was midnight I don't have time preach these subjects do it was midnight but there was light and that light brought something in the darkest hour light brought instruction can you imagine brother Bram said it like this he said how did he he know them men could help him that's that's getting powerful now they're beaten they're look like common prisoners yeah but he believed they could help him yeah wow brother M said it was something with their testimony in their singing and they're talking about the word that made him believe they were spiritual people no matter the condition they were in physically brother BR said it was because they were so faithful to God in such a condition he said and God is not a respector of person and if you're faithful in your position he said the same God that was there for them is here for you look what he said to them he said to them amen what can I do brother R said there's your testimony right there that they ask him how to get saved their testimony was having influence now here's the thing brother has when their testimony has an influence we don't know how powerful our testimonies are you really you really don't know many people don't understand the depth or the power of their own testimony but your testimony is powerful and and let me just take the Old Testament can I amen when in the book of Kings there was a little girl from Israel taken captive by non in the Syrian Army and he took her back to his house amen and the Bible said it was a leper and she went to the mistress and said if my if my Lord could go down to my country he could be healed of that leprosy now if you're a Bible reader go to the Book of Luke the fourth chapter Jesus himself said though no leper was healed in the Days of Elijah other than nonon the Syrian she had not one instance to tell them non hey man this person was healed of leprosy or this person she just knew the God I'm serving can do do anything if you can believe it and her testimony influenced the man and he got his healing from her testimony do you know amen I know that we that we uh that we don't believe in women preachers but we certainly believe in women testimonies cuz you know it was a woman that won the whole city of Saar in the Bible amen a woman standing by the well when Jesus approached under her and let me just say this she was a harlot by amen she was a harlot that's what she did she was a loose woman she was a no good woman matter of fact her morals were worse than every person probably in the city and the reason she was at the well at the time she was at the well cuz she couldn't come with the virgins amen but Jesus said I have a need to go down to Samaria and because there was a seed in that woman she was more righteous than all of the Pharisees were righteous now look what happened when Jesus walked up to her amen he could have just been a common man race got into trouble right quite quick race and religion entered right in conversation bring me a drink she said it's not right for you to ask me a drink we're of two different races and he said well our fathers worshiped in this mountain so they start talking about worship and Jesus said well hey man my father seeks such a worship in spirit and truth and she said well when the Messiah comes you know he's going to set up worship yeah she looks over at him and he said well bring me a drink she said she said you don't have nothing to draw from he said if you knew who I was you'd ask me for a drink if you knew who that was You' ask for the drink now watch what happens and then he tells you go get your husband remember the story go get your husband she said I don't have one said well you true you're speaking truth you had five the one you're living with right now is not yours isn't that something but the the seventh one has just arrived and look at what he does he unveils her secret sin which she as a harlot recognizes immediately he's the Messiah sir I perceive thou art a prophet he says now she says there was a prophet and the Messiah cometh when he comes he'll tell us these things she said he says I'm he woo now the Bible said she ran into the City and many believed because of her testimony a woman without any influence at all had influence because she had been influenced under the gift that God had promised to be send into that age now I think it's a reality church I think it's a reality that Jesus stood here in Matthew the 12th chapter and he says it very clearly and he says as Jonah was three days in the belly of the well he said there will be no sign given except for the sign of Resurrection in the in the last days he said as Queen of the Queen of Sheba he said she'll rise up in judgment against this wicked and adulterous generation now now the scriptures takes two people Jonah and takes Queen of Sheba do you know both of them come in contact with that Messiah sign now I'm not off my subject both of them come in contact with that Messiah sign those were changed by the Messiah sign Queen of Sheba was changed by by the interview that she spoke unto Solomon the Church of the Living God in the last days here's the same sign that the queen of Shea heard what she would have heard one time we have heard thousands of times and watch the prophet say it and if the Queen of Sheba would judge the generation that Jesus was in what about this generation when the prophet says he does more of that in one meeting than he done in the entire Bible that you're reading Jesus said it very clearly he said a greater than Solomon is here a greater than Solomon's here you said what does that mean amen he said he was a glorified Jesus now he says what it is it's the Holy Ghost that's here now and watch this here Paul is in that dark place and the creator of Heaven and Earth was in there with him amen he was in a jail but God was in the jail amen he was in bonds but God was in bonds and when he began to worship God began to take down the walls and he reached out and said thy and thine house shall be saved now to understand thy house you know it's not it's not your home it's not your home it's not your house brother BR said go right back to job and look at what job did when the Bible said he lost seven children job offered blood for his children before they died how many knows that the Bible said he offered pre- adventuring that something would happen brother B says watch job met righteousness by the sacrifice of that blood he said but you and I today are not asked to sacrifice a lamb for our children he said but according to the scripture that if we believe it will be imputed unto us for righteousness righteousness in this age is our faith in the word of God to think this morning we've been given an opportunity to stand there where that Roman soldier stood when he heard Paul say believe in thy and thine house shall be saved the testimony that they have believe and thy and thine house shall be saved and they they heard the word and were changed I could go back here and and and find brother brandham saying some very powerful things he says now here's the thing if you drop back to job you can see that job lost it all but then God turned it around and gave it back to him he didn't double his children but he gave them to him in heaven oh brother Kevin he gave them in heaven brother B said see he doubles everything but he gave this to them in heaven with eternal life now I know I know that has to that has you you got to you got to you got to have a little maturity on you to swallow that it's not going to be for a baby now position in church positioning under a prophet positioning setting in a place where the law says if you can believe it it's possible setting in the place amen knowing that whatever you can get under the token God will give you the same as job offered the righteousness we have offered our faith and the destruction of this world cannot change what God has gave us I'll give you direct instruction if you got an unsaved child lay the token right on top and say the Lord God I claim him yes and you stay right there if you got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay the token on them and say Lord God I claim them come on I believe it's good for right now I don't believe I believe right here in this atmosphere right now amen do you are to say Lord God I claim them in the name of Jesus and I know what the devil's doing the devil's trying to turn everything to look this way or look that way but God who is rich in Mercy told the truth truth concerning these things and gave us an example in the age we're living in we're not living we're not living here today amen as a bunch of ha Heretics we're not standing here with a bunch of fairy tales and ideas we have faced the reality of these quotes in our own lives come on it's right on tape amen it's right on tape brother Bram speaking squirrels the third poll now we're talking about positioned people Mountain Moving Faith speak the word and move forward Prophet is squirrel hunting and uses the commission of Mark 11 and Mark 9 says if you can ask anything and believe it it's possible Mark 11 says you can speak it and it'll happen and a prophet standing there under that anointing created [Music] squirrels I know it's not for everybody but to the believer it's a powerful reality that the spoken word can create something that ain't even there come on that creation story was taken to hady Wright's house listen folks it was only a story until she believed it it was only a story but when her little heart said that's the truth brother brandham something quickened on the inside of her and she moved from a fairy tale to a reality knowing the same faith that created squirrels that saved her soul could get a hold of her children what she did that day was she said sister Courtney she said that ain't nothing but the truth because you know what she did she did ask a question and asking questions are not wrong it's according to how you ask it because she did ask brother brandom you created that squirel brother BR said H what happened out there and he said Haddie I can't tell you other than he's the same Jehovah jyra that created the realm in the wilderness for Abraham and he created that squirrel for me and she agreed that's true because it was Abraham seed and we were heir to the same promises and when she said it's nothing but the truth brother randam that turned right toward her woo can you imagine when it turns towards you and your life and your heart you're just setting in a meeting Amen in the word of God but all of a sudden the anointing turned on you and it's speaking right to you and it's saying brother Mark God hears your prayer and the anointing turns and when it turns God can move heavens and earth but he can't fail with that word look had your R standing there nothing but the truth somebody said well is that scriptural brother brother Wayne of course it's scriptural the first Gentile that ever had a miracle in the Bible was a woman with a sick baby and she came to Jesus and Jesus wouldn't talk to her because she was trying to approach him in a certain word that didn't belong to her position she came to him as a son of David wrong position lady all power in Heaven and Earth was standing right there the Son of God was right there everything was right there but she had to switch positions and the moment she switched positions she said to him Lord Lord that did it Lord amen when she called him Lord she got his attention because that's what he is to this Gentile Church he's not the son of David he's your Lord he's your husband man he's the king of kings but he's not the son of David to the church he's the son of man and when she recognized her her Authority come under the son of man dispensation she began to agree with him and he even looked at and now this is hard and he even looked at her amen and he says to her he says look I know you want healing but it's the children's bread and you Gentiles are just a bunch of dogs let me just put it plain language you're just a bunch of dogs and this belongs to the Jews and she didn't get aggravated and stomp out she switched her position and she said Lord but even the dogs could get the crumbs from the master's table and when she took that position with him Hallelujah change come over their lives change come into their hearts when you get in the right position with God hallelujah all things are possible and you know what you know the rest of the story you know the rest of the story he said because of this saying lady brother BR said there's the first miracle ever done in a gentile and it was because of this saying and because of your saying Haddie yeah and because of your agreement with the word of God listen hady didn't have a prayer meeting that morning church she believed the message she was hearing and God quickened faith and Faith got a hold of her family and everything was changed said well that's just one time it wasn't actually there was a Dalton family from Kentucky Jim had Dalton friend of mine from flagst Pastor a while his dad Ed Dalton they were down I think they were actually men andite wasn't they originally it was some kind of a cultish Amish menite something another cuz when they left uh they blocked them you know you know what they call it they kick them out they shunned them yeah they shunned him and when they done that he lost his business pretty much so he sold all of his equipment and then turned around and bought himself a bunch of trucks and brother Jim said he wrecked every truck they wrecked every truck he said finally he drove the last one himself and he said Dad wrecked it himself he said he was setting it bankrupt cuz they back then they just bought the stuff themselves you know so he went he said he went on the platform he's going to brother bram's meetings he's standing on the platform he said brother Bram was standing there and there's a woman in front of him this is from Brother Dalton's testimony he said the woman's in front of him and he was sitting there in his heart saying Lord I got a house full of unsaved kids but I'm at bankruptcy and my family I'm at bankruptcy I don't know what I'm going to do I need this finances and he said he was standing there wondering what he was going to say when he got in the prayer line he said and when he stepped up he said instead of questioning he said the first thing out of his mouth is I'd like to have my children he said in the minute when he spoke it brother BR said it belongs to you and he gave them to him in that prayer line so years later I'm listenting tapes I didn't even know about this one there was a lady out in the Phoenix meeting it's in the evening meeting and she steps there and she starts uh in the prayer line and brother BR says oh I see why you're really here now' he said 'you sick he said' but you got an unsaved husband unsaved daughter and they're home right now he said but in the name of Jesus Christ I give them to you you call in in the next service brother Bram comes along and he said I was listening back over the prayerline last night how many of y'all heard the angel of the Lord give that woman her her people I read that out there in Oregon one time in a meeting stoval is the name stoval and I was spelling the stoval amen and after I got done with the meeting Brother Ray a lady met me on the outside there in Oregon and she said God bless you brother Lawson she said I'm the little girl in the prayerline you were talking about said me and my dad were saved in those meetings said see there's a reality to this message there's a reality to these things these are not just little mths floating around but there's reality in this there's a truth behind this listen all the devils in hell will never stop the faith I'm a Believer once he gets gets a hold of God and says it belongs to me I was in a meeting down at Tim PR back maybe five six years ago a little girl come up in the prayer line a young a wear girl and she said brother Wayne said my my brother is at home he's in bad shape and I'm asking prayer for him and I prayed for him that night brother Tim and I in the in the prayer meetings on a Wednesday night that little girl walked off it was early in the evening brother Tim had called a Deliverance she's still on tape they called the Deliverance line the entire line just kept coming kept coming and I spoke about the 11th Hour people getting the 11th Hour promises and I was talking about that 11th Hour well while I was standing that prayer line it just got longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and after a while I thought these poor people that come in here at 9:00 they got a different preacher than the ones that came in at 11:00 as you start getting weary in your body you know and I was getting weary and I was getting tired and I was saying Lord don't don't let me do this don't let my body fail me Lord and and the and the Lord spoke to my heart and he says didn't you say the 11th Hour that the people in the end will get the same thing as those in the beginning and I said yes sir Lord and when I said that Holy Spirit just pick right up just like it was the front of the prayer line and about that time brother Tim Taps me on the shoulder he said look right over there and I look and there's a young man standing there brother we and couple of the people was standing around him and he was in I don't it seemed like he was in pajamas maybe it's probably on tape but he he definitely was in some kind of bed clothes just shorts or I mean jogging pants and a shirt or something and he had that bed head I don't think it's normal wear but it was all messed up kind of like mine probably right now but he was standing right there and I look over at him and and uh and brother Tim says brother Wayne that's the young man that we were praying for just a little while ago that young man was at home and when and when we were praying the Holy Spirit woke that boy up and he it the meeting kept going later and later and he got to WAN he got to wanting to go home so so he wondered why is mom not home why is Dad not home why is the family not home so he so he he looks out and some of the neighbors go to church they're not home well the first thing comes to his mind I've missed the Rapture I've missed the Rapture so he jumps in his truck and goes barreling and I think they said he wiped out a vence and knocked out his transmission he he he he pulled up to the front front that when he parked his truck in front of the church it never moved again they had to tow it off he run through fences and up pastures and I mean it was a reality to him I've missed this thing and he comes running in the back door of the church and he looks and they're still having church at whatever time 11:30 at night and he looks in there and when he realizes there's time for me brother he come running down that all alar and gave his life listen amen that little girl prayed the prayer and it wasn't an hour later that boy was in an altar because there's a reality to these things listen I say this to you today you may be setting by somebody right now that you prayed for a long time but God who is rich in Mercy and if God's done that for you you ought to rejoice in the Lord every day you ought to not worry about every little bump they have or every little trouble they have don't don't let that take your faith away from you if God's given that to you you ought to just go on believing amen because God who is rich in Mercy has gave this to you listen I want to say this with all of my heart amen there's still time left for you this morning maybe somebody sting here saying God I need the Holy Ghost well it's your day it's your hour this is the season right now is the time the holy ghost is real and is still here listen let me say this with all my heart you only have to come to an alter receive the Holy Ghost right now there is an atmosphere built in this building right now if you could just believe it the Holy Ghost could come into your life the power of God can change your life listen the sickness is on your body brother B said after a couple days you'll begin to realize they're gone from your body because healing is in the atmosphere Deliverance is in the atmosphere freedom is in the atmosphere woo get in get in a position where it's acceptable and it can happen come musicians come this morning get yourself in that position brother Seth man find that position all kinds of things start turning loose people say well this can't happen that can't happen all of a sudden you watch it just like that you make a step for him watch him make a step for you watch it change you say uh standing in that darkness no hope I might as well just end my life there's no way there's no hope there's no hope at all and you hear that voice coming out of the darkness don't take your life amen there's a man here yeah that can turn on the lights I tell you what it's a powerful thing when the Holy Spirit begins to move and then shows you the way begins to lead you to believe things I'm sitting here today I'm looking at Miracle after miracle and they're just rolling through my mind I'm sitting here looking one after the other Miracle on top of Miracles because it's real is it not sh is it not real is he not the god of Elijah certainly woman what does thou desire oh don't don't don't play with me prophet yes no what do you desire I desire a child and she had a child and the enemy come to take the child and the same Ministry come around and gave life back to it cuz he's a miracle working God I was looking for Anna sitting in here somewhere and maybe she's in the back when your Miracles are young you know you you parents understand young Miracles still in that training stages but but that but that life that Grace you think well all of a sudden you think well this is this this could be it this is it there's just no horn there just no world isn't it odd how quick the enemy can shut out all the lights yeah just just all of a sudden every path every every exit every every it just starts shutting off one by the other I can't I can't go this way and I can't go this way and I don't know what I'm going to do and see but when the light when the light came into the room amen who would have knew that you just had to believe amen do you ever notice that what he said he didn't say to Paul Paul what do we have to quit doing to be saved that's good he said what must I do to be be saved believe on the Lord Jesus with all thine heart and thine in that house don't underestimate your faith am don't underestimate what it can do for you this morning it can take situations that seem just like there's no end to it and all of a sudden there comes the light amen just all all a sudden from bankruptcy but believe in thine and thine house I counted that the horse clan on picture the other day was it about 29 or 30 from faith said brother L you're crazy no I got children if you ain't got them yet you you wait but when something drops into your heart and the Lord said I've given them to you brother then all the demons in hell they got to stop right there faith do you know do you know that it was $20 that brother Braham had for Hatty rright many ever hear it $20 she had give $40 to the building fund and brother Neville saw her do it so he gave her 20 back brother Bram say she lived on $200 a year that was a lot of money she had brother Bram said when I went down there squirrel hunting I had the the extra 20 in my pocket to give her back and he said and when I went to do it he said the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said no I have something greater for her I I don't want y'all to think I'm crazy but in our in our youth camp the other day during that prayer line some of you young ladies were working in that prayer line and God bless you he'll bless you greatly for what you've done amen but I hope this is okay but sometimes when you're a player line it's the oddest thing something somebody something will speak to you and you just you don't even know why but it just comes to you and we were sitting there praying for those people and I seen those little girls and some of them were going out under the anointing and they were rejoicing and and I looked up and just as the anointing just was coming by and I looked up and Sister Elma was coming through and she was helping them but she was dancing in while she was doing it and it just it just touched my heart I just just in that moment it just something inside my heart it just I think it was the Lord and when I looked at her I said Lord I'd like to do a little something for her when this is over maybe just maybe you you put something on her heart just do a little special something for being an Elma and when I said that immediately he spoke back to me he said I had something greater than that for her thank you Lord and about three steps that one stepped in the prayer line and the Holy Spirit began to strike her right there in front of us now FS to see your children under the anointing of the Holy Ghost is a greatest gift God could give a person it's a reality this morning you said brother Wayne I want to see those things get in that position where he's Lord and everything that he said belongs to you and if he said you can claim them and they be your children then you believe that because he's your lord the enemy comes and says it ain't that way he's a liar he's your lord Amen brother Ben could you help us
