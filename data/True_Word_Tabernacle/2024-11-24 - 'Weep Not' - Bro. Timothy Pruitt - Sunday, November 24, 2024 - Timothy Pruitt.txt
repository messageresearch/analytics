hallelujah want to go to the Lord in prayer this morning testimony from Sister Barb kovi says almost three years ago first testimony almost three years ago I got Co and it damaged my heart at the time I had an appointment already to see a cardiologist because my regular doctor thought I needed a pacemaker because my heartbeat was so low before the appointment came up I got Co and it threw me into a fib with my heart beating over 120 at times and for long periods the cardiologist implanted a link recorder in my chest which is like an EKG going 24/7 after watching that for several months he said I needed a heart oblation which I had a year ago at first it seemed to work but later the aib started back I had another appointment to go to the cardiologist but at the Fall Festival some of the sisters felt led to lay hands on me and prayed for my heart the next week I went in for the appointment and he looked at the report for the prior month and told me I had had 27 episodes that month of aib this month when I got the report it showed zero episodes I have never had a zero episode in any month since I had to recorder implanted I thank the Lord for his touch and for my sisters being led to pray for me second testimony I've had a chronic cough for over two years and in the spring I ended up with double pneumonia and was hospitalized for 4 days and was given a lot of different antibiotics through IV while I was there the X-ray at that time showed infection in both lungs it took a while but I did start to feel better and my doctor told me to get a new x-ray in about 4 months to make sure my lungs were clear they were they were not but it showed it was only in the left lung so she sent me to a pulmonary specialist and he did an x-ray and by that time it was down to the lower part of the lung he sent me to get a CT scan because he said he thought I had some kind kind of lung disease the CT scan still showed something in the left lower so we are watching that and the CT will be repeated in January CT scans show a lot of other things and it showed I had a very enlarged spleen and curosis of the liver that came as a huge surprise sister Linda and sister Gail and Brandon my grandson all told me the same thing to do naturally so I started doing that and three weeks ago I came up for prayer and brother Wayne and brother Ray and others prayed for me and the next day I noticed this huge differences in how I felt my energy level was up the brain fog which was terrible was gone the exhaustion was gone all the things I thought was coming from my heart could actually have been the liver I did not realize it caused all that but I have had the best three weeks of my life in the last three years I know I received a touch from the Lord I honestly feel like a

see the wonderful building that's going up and I know sometimes it seems like it may be taking forever ever um but just just stay the course it'll be worth it I know what it's like we went through a building project for about three years and and well maybe a little bit longer with all the other things we've done but as far as the church is about three years and I and I'd say the Lord was with us every step of the way and helped us pay for every bit of it and I believe God's the same today and he'll do the same for you amen and just put your shoulder to the wheel and everything that you can do with all your heart make the ball go down the road a little easier whatever it is amen God bless you for it and he as he's blessed us and um it's just amazing what God can do and if you if you just

think he's here today but but just just you know to uh to see God use men and God's used brother Wayne in our life many times through many things personally and uh not just personally but as well as church and things but we're just thankful for a life that's lived for Jesus Christ and uh we we love him down in the South and hated to see him go north but amen but it is what it is I guess amen but uh you know you got one of them Southern generals up here watch out they'll wreck some stuff am amen hey brother Ben was talking about Ohio State I can talk about that I guess it's okay amen God bless you today Revelations chapter 5 and verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their on and one of the elders said unto me weep not and that's where I'd like to speak from this this morning weep not behold the the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of the David hath prevailed to open the book and the loose of Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having ever one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and they open the seals thereof for thou H has thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy Blood Out out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us under our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and have heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders ERS and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I say so it went from weeping to a shout heard I saying blessing and honor honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four be said a man and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen amen God bless you this morning you can have your seats amen just like to say again I'd like to speak on weep not and I was looking at this thought and and and preached it at home here uh couple a week or so ago and Lord just been dealing with me on it for this morning and I was looking what brother Brandon was speaking about he said it was a strong Angel a strong angel with a loud voice so it wasn't a norm you know just a normal voice or a as you may speak normally to one another but it was a strong voice a loud voice proclaiming who is worthy worthy for what who is worthy to take the book and I I got to looking in that word strong and that strong means one of great strength a warrior or an authority a master of authority he's strong he's Mighty and I and I I read in one Psalms 103 and we'll go through a few scriptures just quote them for a minute it says bless the Lord ye his angels that excel in strength they excel in strength and do his Commandments and hearkens hearken to the voice of the word we can also read in Revelations 10:1 it it expresses a mighty angel this is a forceable powerful strong Valiant Angel amen so he would as he would as the prophecy of his of this lamb coming Isaiah would pick it up and he would say for us unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful and counselor the Mighty God the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Mighty God is one of great strength or authority or great that is able to Prevail or in other words he's successful in his strength and in his his authority so a God that is mighty a god that is mighty in battle he's he's mighty to save a God we sering a god who's not afraid of conflict amen he's not afraid to face his enemies he's not afraid to come to your Aid when you have need of him so we're not in the hands of someone who's incapable of handling what we're going through or what life may throw at us amen he's not surprised what you're going through this morning he already saw it coming before you ever got there and he already has the answer for you Amen in your situation so he is in control he has always been in control and he will always be in control Amen in Zephaniah verse chapter 3 it says the Lord your God he is in your midst and he's a mighty one who will save amen he's a mighty one who was saved Deuteronomy talks about him and says the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords he's the great the Mighty the awesome God who's not partial and takes no bribes I love that so there's no deal the devil can make with him over your soul amen he's not going to take a bribe there's not enough money that can buy you but he gave the most precious price for you when he gave his life for you amen and he's not here to trade he's not here to make a deal but he's going to take what is his off the face of this Earth in a Rapture in a body change amen so he's not come to this moment in the time that we're living in and all the chaos that's around us and thinking how am I going to do this how that's going to happen no all that is happening upon the face of this Earth is pre-planned by almighty God what you're going through is pre praying by almighty God God saw it God knows about it and he's there for you in your trial he's there for you in your tears he's there for you in your trouble this God is not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you he's not going to walk away when the time gets hard or the time gets hard struggles the struggle in your life gets rough but he'll stay right beside you and hold your hand through it all amen amen he says here in Psalms 145 he says great is the Lord and he's greatly to be praised amen his greatness is unsearchable Hebrews one said he's a he is a Radiance of the glory of God the exact imprint of his nature he upholds the universe by the word of his power amen that's amazing the word of his power by his word he said let there be a son and it's still there today amen well it may be clouds up there but that's still a sun there amen why because he said let there be light millions or whatever it was years ago he said let there be light and it happened whatever long it was it happened and that son Rises every day to show you God's word is still powerful that's why the rising of the sun happens it's a testimony every morning of your life this is why he said his mercies are new every morning when that sun comes up it's a reminder God's word is true God's word is still the truth God's word Still Remains it doesn't matter the clouds it doesn't matter the darkness when it's time for the sun to rise it'll rise Glory Amen in Psalms 147 he says great is our Lord and abundant in power abundant in power Jeremiah says it like this oh Lord God it is you that made the heavens and the Earth and by your great power and by your outstretched arm nothing is too hard for you buddy I've gained a lot of strength from that scripture right there nothing is too hard for him amen nothing what what about my sickness nothing what about my children nothing nothing is too hard for you job nine says he is a wise in heart and mighty in strength First Chronicles says it like this yours oh Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in heavens and earth is yours yours is the kingdom of Lord and you are exalted as head above it all but here John is found in the he's found weeping even after he hears this strong Angel he's found weeping and why because a book had been lost it went back to the original owner it had been forfeited by the by a son the first Son of God the human race and he forfeit his rights to Listen by listening to Satan he give it up what did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's word come on Amen sons of God that'll take a seminary idea about it instead of the word of God same thing Adam did you'll forfeit your right amen you take psychology over the word of God you'll forfeit your rights if you take a man's idea or intellectual opinions you'll forfeit your rights but if you'll stay with the word of God you'll still have every right that belongs to you what did he do it went straight back as a quote can you see where those ages have been went straight back to the original holder and John in the spirit amen standing up here in heaven he' just been lifted up now from the church ages saw the church Jes and when he was taken up in the fourth chapter he said come up higher I'm going to show you things that will come amen this is what he said in Revelations chapter one I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day come on somebody and I heard behind me a a little voice no a great voice and a trumpet he said brother R said I was in the spirit he said isn't that beautiful amen let me tell you it wasn't by accident brother Ben talked about Ohio State in Michigan okay I was in the spirit my I love that you could just call those words the whole of Christian Life I love that in other words all every day of your life you ought to be caught up in the spirit amen the whole of Christian Life if we're going to live as Christians we have to be in a spirit John was not talking about his own spirit that would have not brought brought Visions it had to be the spirit of God it has to be the spirit of God with us too or all our efforts are in vain you can build the biggest church you want to if it's all about a man it's all in vain but if God be there and I say he is here this morning Paul said I will pray in the spirit I'll sing in the spirit I'll live in The Spirit Well if that was good enough for Paul it's good enough for me amen if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive those tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given us to live by his word for it is the same spirit and he goes on he said look at it this way all too many read the Bible where it said in Acts 238 repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and they go right on he said they don't see it if they saw it by getting the spirit they would know they want to receive the Holy Spirit they would know they need to repent they would know they would need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then God would be Duty bound to fulfill his word by giving him the Holy Ghost amen they never get in the spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to God for a revelation by his spirit amen that's the first step get in the spirit let me just another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have to read it count Countess time but did it not get in the but did not get in the spirit when reading it hello we've read by his stripes are healed but get in the spirit first amen did you he said did you ask God for his Spirit to teach you the real truth of it if we did we'd call the Elders we'd confess our sins we'd be anointed we'd be prayed for and that would be that Hallelujah it might not come immediately but in his spirit it's all over there's no other court of appeal God will fulfill his word we need to get in the spirit then those things will be done that's right don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts come on Hallelujah you know sometimes we I'm a song leader so sometimes we depend on the song leader and that's fine he needs to he needs to get in the spirit and and you're blessed by a wonderful song leader brother Ben I watch him and I see amen God move upon his life and all a sudden he'll sing this song why because he's in the spirit and it'll move over here and it'll move over there things he don't even know going on and and a certain song will come and it'll break bonds off of people's lives why because he was in the spirit but listen don't leave that all on the song leader don't leave that all in a preacher amen every one of us need to come to House of God and say God I want to be in the spirit I want to see you move I've been moaning I've been groaning I've been complaining I've been all of this but let it cease and let me see your spirit in my life then it won't be a song leader trying to lift you up you'll be up you'll be ready I love it like there some some Services you can come to as a song leader and you can come first song boom like what happened what was it people were in the spirit the pre-service music started playing one started reading the Bible one started praying next thing you know they begin to move into another atmosphere amen that's the atmosphere that's what we're looking for get in the spirit then go through acts and watch what God to do then it stops and he brings it down to some maybe we can catch he say have you ever noticed how the world gets in the spirit of things that are in the world yeah that's right they go to their ball games they go to their sporting events and they're dancing they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers and old dried up sticks well I'm going to tell you brother I ain't emotional and you go to the ball game and act like a fool come on I've seen them I've seen them at ball game man they they take their shirts off and they paint their bodies and they got their team team spirit right team spirit you know Ohio State this or this that and the other LSU this I'll get my hide too how about that go team go go team go and man they start running down that field and they get crazy come on you tell me right now you have to excuse my cof been dealing with this tell me right now the running back whatever his name is for Ohio State breaks loose and he's running through Michigan like a butter through a come on come on and he's headed for that touchdown line boy that's a pretty good deal come on come on come on told you wouldn't by accident brother Ben said what he said I sat back there and just laughed said God you're doing something here and he he's running down toward that touchdown Ryan man you just sitting on your hands like man wow we just took the lead M you can you believe it we're up 35 to nothing amazing no that ain't the way it is that old flesh gets kicking you see that old boy break through that line and he's headed for the end zone go out run and let's just be honest Them Boys Ain't Nothing But Sinners Them Boys Ain't Nothing But hor mongers and everything else be what to say what they are amen that's all they are and we can shout and Carry On and all about that but we got a champion and he comes in our midst and he heals our disease and he saves the lost and he moves among us and I'm supposed to sit on my hands no sir I'm going to give him glory when I see him come on my behalf and he moves on my knee I'm not going to sit there like a [Applause] Wallflower I'm going to shout the glories of God I'm going to praise a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world oh amen why cuz there a spirit there he said they enter right into the field of things and become part of it but oh how they hate the Christian for getting into the spirit of God's word they would look at you this morning and say you lunatic and there what kind of lunatic are they come on they call us Fanatics they call us holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that did you hear me or did you hear the prophet of God he said ignore that people going to call you a bunch of Holy Rollers they going to call you a bunch of dancers and carrying on you're just a Pentecostal Holy Roller ignore that don't even listen to that nonsense amen you just go on with Jesus [Applause] can I say it this way my Jesus is headed to the finish line and watch's the Finish Line is it a touchdown is it seven points no it's a body change amen it's a moment in a twinkling of eye the dead in Christ is going to rise he says they go on and and they worshiped that thing he said you just go on and get in the spirit of worship our Spirits are clean it's fresh it's real it's sober it's serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord the Christian now listen to this statement right here the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it's saviors and delights in its Pleasures wow wow you know I'm going to just stay on it I'm sorry I ain't sorry there ain't nothing you Ohio State people love more than tears from a Michigan man why they got tears cuz they lost come on just going to say it y'all had tears for a few years yourself why because you lost and this is what John is looking at he's looking at losing and this is why he's weeping cuz he sees that there's no one worthy to take the book but a voice speaks don't worry about it weep not John you're not going to [Applause] lose could you imagine being on a team that cannot [Applause] lose Hallelujah you can walk through cancer and you won't lose you walk through every kind of hell and you won't lose you walk through death and you won't lose you can not lose so this is not the time for weeping this is a time for rejoicing cuz we have a lamb that has prevailed John got in the spirit to see those things there he was in his time and his flesh you're just getting in the flesh well of course I'm in my flesh what are you but I'm also there's some on the inside of me that's been called into another realm and I'm looking at things that cannot be seen John couldn't see what he saw with his natural eyes he had to be caught into a place to be able to see things that could not be seen with these eyes if you look with these eyes right now you say oh brother so and so he got this fault s so and so she said this about me this is over here but if you'll just get the moving into the Realms of the spirit lifting up then you won't see all that negativity can I just say it like this I I'm not trying to meddle but I'm just going as I feel L I know in a building project there gets to be a lot of negativity flying around it's best not to even dwell on that negativity it's best to stay focused on what God has called us to [Music] do amen it's best to stay in that channel in that channel and behind the leadership and say whatever amen they might not pick out my favorite carpet they not might not pick out my f but it ain't got nothing to do with what color the carpet is or what color the pain is it has to do with the spirit of God is here that's where the Liberty is and that's where I want to be amen I was kind of the overseer general contractor they wanted to call me whatever of our building project because I was able to be there when other brothers had full-time jobs I was able to meet the Subs and Such and brother Wayne came and rode many hours on a bulldozzer really appreciate him and thank him for that you know and I may have told this before but I tell it again one of the hardest things in our whole deal our whole building project was the sound there's two things that can't hardly get right it's AC and heat and sound people get tore up from the floor up about it just mad and this is what happened we we got we actually got bows to come and and and they took every measurement in our building all the little bump outs like that how far the wall went every Pew everything I mean they had a detailed map of our thing and they made speakers that would sit right there at certain places and they send us back a blueprint said you hang them this far apart this far off this wall that far off this wall this high and this pitch wow well some of the brothers that were in The Sound thought this is crazy that looks stupid that that ain't going to work and I said look Bose didn't get to being Bose by being a bunch of idiots they told us where to put them I'm going to put them where they said put them you can get mading do whatever you want to but when they come here if they don't work they come here it ain't going to be C I moved them in the middle or I did something different they going to be according to the blueprint so that was a heel I was willing to die on and I just about died on it so we hung them with both said and we plugged it in worst sound ever terrible we went we had our dedication meeting brother Wayne was there worst sound ever terrible I told you them speakers need to be over here and I told you that and I'm just like Lord what do we do so brother Michael calls Bose and he's telling them about it and they sent their engineer the one who designed our our build they sent him from the West Coast flew him right into streetport rented a car met us at our church with our sound texts and different ones and he walked up this aisle and we got a mezzan he walks up that mezzan turns on a certain sound kind of like a white noise but it's a little different I think so he could he could hear everything should be the same no matter where he walked and there was a few areas like in the center was supposed to be a little lighter according to their measurements and things but man you could sit over here and get your ear your eard drums blowed out and be two seats over and you couldn't hear nothing wow that's the way it was and so he walks up that aisle and he comes back he walks up that aisle and he comes back and he stops he said I'll bet every every dollar I got the wires are wrong our sound technicians wired it I said oh really wires wrong what do you mean he said on your amps he said Bose is different he said most of them is like positive negative positive negative he said but Bose is positive negative negative positive or something like that and he said so two of them wires are swapped I'll bet every dollar said you give me 10 a screwdriver in 10 minutes I'll fix this say wow said well let me find a screwdriver I got a screwdriver 10 minutes later he said all right set everything back to factory settings now turn it on and sound filled the room most beautiful sound I could have rubbed a lot of things in but I I just kind of looked around and people in GL she us looked you know but I got to thinking about that God wants us to be filled amen with a certain sound but Satan will come along in our lives and he'll wire change up a few wires somewhere it's what he loves to do with his message he loves to change a few things just get a couple wires and all of a sudden somebody over here is hearing this somebody over here is hearing that and all kind of confusion is going on but if the master can come and he can take the tool of his word and go in there and just put it back where it needs to be then it can fill up again Hallelujah maybe this morning this Satan has come and he's changed a few things in your life and you got the wowy wowy Woos and you got all kind of things hanging on you and you don't know how you're going to make it you don't know how it's going to happen all it takes is just a few minutes in the presence of the master and he'll change your weeping into Joy you got to get into the spirit of it he said both Christians and the world are humans both have emotions the difference is the Christian's heart and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world is satisfied with the flesh but John got in the spirit here the book of r Redemption The Plan of Redemption the only way you'll ever be redeemed was there a title deed to the Redemption All of all whole heavens and earth it said let him come forward if you will brother Bram said Oh my he said now speak or forever hold his peace let him come forward and claim this book who is worthy to do it and John said there was no man in heaven that was found worthy no man on Earth that was found worthy no man that was under the Earth died was found worthy no man was found worthy there wasn't a pope there wasn't a preacher there wasn't a prophet there wasn't an angel there wasn't nothing but he asked that there be a kinsman redeemer step forth one that was near us one that could feel the pain of humanity and yet overcome one that could go through trials Family Leave Him Church splits all kind of things he was tempted in all things and yet overcome he asked for a kinsman redeemer but no man was no angel no seram they they hadn't sinned but they were a different category they never fallen but they had to be kinsman redeemer and he took a human a k human Kinsman and he asked for it and it wasn't found nowhere nobody no Bishop no Archbishop no Priest No hierarchy my and John wept and he said here's what I think he wept for because if no one was found worthy that could open this book the whole creation was lost here is the book here is the little title deed it'll be offered to the kinsman redeemer that might can that can meet the qualifications that's God's Own law he can't defile his law defy his law rather God's required a kinsman redeemer who was worthy and John looked he looked over the Earth he looked beneath the Earth and there was nobody and he started crying and he wept cuz he thought everything was lost yeah but I love this next statement he says but his crying didn't last but just a minute oh yeah his crying did not last but just a minute there one stood one of the elders says don't weep John his crying did not last but just a minute I looked into that for a moment Psalms 30 says Sing unto the Lord oh you Saints of his and give thanks to the remembrance of his Holiness for his anger endureth for a moment and his favor his life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning I got to look at that weep it means to be Tangled or confused or or lost in a place of uncertainty that brings you to tears how many's ever been there uncertain don't know what's about to take place in your life don't know where you're about to turn to don't know what's the next turn don't know what's going on and oh yeah one time there had been an excuse that you could live in depression or fear at one time there was an excuse you could live in those situations but that ain't that there ain't time for that no more one day all hope seem lost but that's not today today there is a Door of Hope what are you saying I'm saying as a prophet declared the Sun is up it's not Darkness to you anymore the sun is shining amen we don't have to be all bent over and sad and worried and depressed and threatened about all this is going to happen the Sun is up you know like the old slaves back when they Emancipation Proclamation came forth they were abound but on a certain day yeah they were going to be free and the time they was going to be free was when the sun come up we know what they did the women and children little ones the cripples all the way down strung up down the hillside because as soon as the sun come up they were free at the morning of the Sun but that morning as soon as they could they were going to be free well most the most strongest he said like the strongest Christians today they climb Plum to the top of the hill and they watched the first peep of the sun amen the first little peep amen and the one at the top of the hill when he sees it he screams out we're free why because the Sun is up he hollered down the next one the next one hollered to the next one all the way down if they could get the pressure off we're free why are you free the son is up and he said that was the Su you in but today he said let me scream the Sun is up the eso in the even light is shining the Holy Ghost is here the Son of God is riging in the hearts of his people the son is up I'm so glad see the same things take place that did when he was here 2,000 years ago it's happening again we can just let off the pressure cuz he's up from the grave he's up from the dead he's been raised 2,000 years and we're living with him resurrect Ed together sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so what's the use of having that pressure on you excuse me what's the use of having that pressure on you you're allowed it to overcome your thinking and you're allowed it to overcome your thoughts and you're allowed it to overcome every breathing moment people get so depressed so down but if we can just turn our eyes like John did look from no one worthy to a lion that's prevailed a lamb here he was he said an old old Eagle can just scream as much as he want to because every shackles now off him all the crust is gone he said when the worldly crust the worldly habits all the fuss and tempers and stews and all the carrying on running from denomination to denominations all settled you're in Christ Jesus you know eternal life dwells where you look back and you see where you come from back down there out of all that muck and fuss and down there he said I'm up here safe Forever More in Christ Jesus now a new creat a creature so I don't have to weep no more but the devil like to come especially in these times that we're living in and put a gloomy atmosphere over us cloudy all the time around us and we can't see nothing good and we can't see nothing happening we can't see amen but I'm here to ask you one more time look to the lamb look away from your troubles look away from your situation look away from things you can't do nothing about if you wanted to people get all tore up about politics listen all that's all on the orchestration of God I tell you what's going to happen people you know uh it was expecting Cala to be president and now she's not but let me tell you how Visions work it can be fulfilled and you not even know it all I've I've seen a woman already in a purple dress I saw it I I don't I I don't know what you want to do with it but I saw it in a purple and and they described it as royal purple and you know why she said sheward for the for the liberation of women as a sign of the liberation of women that a woman could rise to a power such as this but now Trump's in power well we got four more years you don't know if we got four more days you don't know if we got four more [Applause] hours there's going to be a lot of people in the Rapture happen they're going to say I thought it was supposed to rise in power it can happen like that it happened before in Jesus's day I thought a prophet was supposed to come before and he already did but he didn't come according to their thinking he came walking out of the desert in a skin of a clothes clothes of skin and eating a eating a bug and drinking some hotting and screaming repent like man this is a lunatic who's this guy think he is he's he done lost his mind he been out to the Sund them baked him too long the whole time it was the prophecy being fulfilled and then all of a sudden they see a man carrying a cross and he's carrying it up a hill Amen to Calvary and they're calling be Els above they call him a devil they call him a illegitimate child they call him all kinds of things and the whole time prophecy's been fulfilled I'm not sure how it's all going to happen I just know it's going to happen and as I told my church our church at home I said look don't relax just because Trump's in president no what you got to do is be ready I just want to be ready I don't care who's in president I just want to be ready to go doesn't matter What's happen around me I just want to be ready but he comes and he tries to put this gloominess I've seen him try to put it on individuals and and then on churches sit Gloom down this Gloomy atmosphere you know the world was like that one time the world was without form without void and it had a gloomy atmosphere and the way God broke that he said the spirit of God began to move and a voice spoke and said let there be light so right at the beginning in Genesis 1 he's showing us the spirit has to go with the word that's amen right there at the beginning the spirit of God moved Let There Be that's right amen and here it was this Gloomy atmosphere but a light began to shine and it began to pull back the darkness let me let me I mean I know you understand this but there ain't enough Darkness to hold back a little a little bit of light the smallest light can push back the greatest Darkness amen so the sun begin to drve begin to pull and it begin to dry out the atmospheres and begin to push the gloominous back he said why did he do that he said because down beyond all that gloominess down beyond all that void and that nothingness and the Gloom that was around there down beyond all of that laying in that Earth were seeds and he knew it had to take the son to bring forth the seed and here he is pulling that seed out of the ground and let me say this there wasn't enough muck there wasn't enough mud if that seed was ordained to life it was going to come to life I'll say it in this time if you got gloominess over you and you got doubt and confusion over you if there's a SE Gene of God on the inside the Sun is up there ain't enough the devil can put over you they ain't enough sin there ain't enough doubt there ain't enough unbelief that when that son starts pulling at you it'll pull that seed to life and you go from weeping to shouting the spirit of God it moved with love and compassion and the first day of dawn the sun rose up it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by seed that was a great hour but nothing like on that sun that Sunrise was nothing like on Easter morning this time when the sun leaping in the skies it brought forth a greater sunlight rise than ever because it came with greater news than it did when the Sun at the beginning the sunrise brought the news he is risen he is quickened from the dead as he promised he has broke the seals of the Tomb the first time the sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there would be life upon the Earth this time the Sun s o n Rose it was a dual sun rising another s o n Rising not only a su Rising it was a son had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promised seed by his forn knowledge that was laying upon the Earth no more than the bod life lived back there in the beginning without the sun could bring it to life no more today when sun and Daughters of God and upon the Earth it takes the S so n light to shine down upon them and to bring them to life that's why you got to have in the church without the sun being up in a church seeds are not coming to life oh they might come to a religion they might come to a form of godliness but they're not coming to life well listen we don't want a brother brother Wayne Brother Ray none of ministers we don't want we don't want a a nest full of rotten eggs oh look at all of our eggs we we don't care if they're a bunch of eggs if they're rotten we're not interested in a big church full of people if they're rotten we're not interested in a big big numbers if it's just a bunch of rotten flesh we want the life of Jesus Christ to rise up on the inside of them amen then this dirt that have been laid on our bodies for some time for we were dust in the earth and he said in the heaven that was a book of memories and attributes knowing that because the Son of God raised it would also raise every life the life of every son that was for ordained for this great time he knew it would be he knew it would be don't that give you some courage this morning when you know God knows it would be I'm going through a hard time brother Timothy he knew it would be right he knew I got a lot of sickness he knew it would be I got a lot of situations around me brother Timothy I don't know what he knew it it's like that song he knew me but yet he still loved me he knew my filth and my unbelief and doubts well brother Timothy you was raised on a message p well that don't mean I was saved I don't mean I was filled with the Holy Ghost much as my dad wanted to give it to me he can't do it I had to come to my own experience amen he knew who I was he knew the condition that he found me in so thankful he knew me but yet he still loved me this Easter seal broke and here the Romans Mercy what time did I start help us [Laughter] Jesus he knew he knew the Romans were going to put seals upon his tomb he knew they was going to put guards out there and try to keep him sealed but he still spoke the word in three days I'm going to raise it up again destroy this Temple do what you want but in three days it's going to raise up again they looked at that big old Temple he like how in the world does he not know how long it took to build this [Music] thing I they they're working now on a Catholic Church in Paris now for hundreds of years it was it was he looked he's standing there and they and they're thinking man he done lost his mind three days he wasn't talking about that Temple right yeah he was talking about fulfillment of Prophecy in this Temple and here he is slain and they laid him in a tomb and they said well look we need to put a guard over there because you know per se the disciples come and steal him away and say that he's written okay do it and they put a guard there and they put seals around the tomb and on the third day a light came the sun rose and light descended and it broke the seals of those Roman Tom and it rolled the stone away and I love it amen listen he didn't roll the stone away because he needed it rolled away he could have walked through a he walked through a wall he did it later he'd eat fish and walk and disappear he didn't need that stone out of the way to rise he rolled that stone out of the way to show you to prove you I'm risen yes sir and he broke the seals that that was there and tried to keep him sealed in that place try to keep him hemmed in and the guards listen the devil has tried over and over to seal you in something to seal you in in depression or anxieties or fears or unbelief or sicknesses but a son has come a light has risen in your life and it's here to break every seal the devil may have garrisoned his army around you but he ain't got enough I love that brother rain brought that to our church one time he said the devil can do do what he wants to but he don't have enough cuz if he had enough he would bring enough Hallelujah but he don't have enough amen if he had enough he would bring enough if he had enough to keep you from being a Christian he'd bring enough if he had enough for you to keep you from being healed and delivered and set free he' bring it enough this morning but he don't have enough cuz there's a mighty God among us there's the same yesterday of mang us there's the same God that broke that tomb open and break this tomb open and you can walk out free delivered here he was weeping and a voice spoke and said weep not for the lion of the tribe of Judah has reviled prevailed means he wrestled with it and he's overcome it in the Garden of Gethsemane when blood dropped down out of his face it was overcoming the line and the root of David had prevailed it had overcome Jacob in the as he wrestled with that angel he prevailed he said I'm not gonna let you go I'm not gonna let you go till you bless me I I've been a deceiver I I need a change and he prevailed and the angel smote him on the hip and he left there from being a deceiver and a name changed to being a prince with God he prevailed this line of the tribe of Judah prevailed don't weep John for the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed he's already overcome he done it it's over John he produced a bleach that send sin back to the greasy hands it belongs to amen I love that right there Old Devil in his greasy hands amen that sin that bleach has brought it back to those greasy hands he said you know I see an artist paint his picture with a bunch of clothes wrapped around brother they did every deg graceful thing they could do to him they stripped him off beat him done just everything they could do he had to pay the full penalty of your sins he had to pay the full penalty for my sins but that's where he conquered death that's where he conquered hell that's where he conquered the grave that's that's where he conquered your peace woo hallelujah amen that's where he conquered your peace that's where he conquered your healing that's where he conquered your joy you can have joy this morning why cuz brother Timothy said so no but because the LI has prevailed Jesus at the age of 33 had conquered Devils oh they knew him they knew who he was we know who you are the Holy One Of God why do you come to torment us before this time it's amazing you would have to go to a devil to find out who he really was because the Devils knew it knowing they had a future punishment coming I I need to read that one more time in case there's a devil here this morning you got a future punishment coming cancer you have a future punishment coming whatever disease you want that you have a future punishment coming sir can I just say it like this the devil that you're dealing with he won't last forever he has an expiration date you ever pulled out a jug of milk what your first thing you look for this thing expired well Grandpa now you got this thing expired glasses by the way I'm a grandpa now yeah May should say like this by the way I'm a grandpa now but listen the devil you're facing this morning he has an expiration date it's it's written on him oh God there's going

week that we set aside for brother rain to Wayne to come it's supposed to be raining on Wednesday so on Monday we start pushing dirt we start pushing dirt and man's coming on Wednesday about noon time when we're trying to get the last few loads he disappears and I call him and I I fussed him out in a Christian way like man I got this guy all the way from Ohio and he's on this Dozer and we need dirt where you at well I had to go do this other job I said but we paid you I you know whatever I need dirt so he finally showed up and as brother Wayne's pushing the last little dirt over the bottom falls out I run got the truck come back and he gets in the truck now it's Wednesday church is at 7 well Wayne's preaching it's around 5:00 yeah I'm feeling pretty terrible one I lost my mind two brother Wayne's preaching in two hours like God have mercy I look over brother Wayne said brother Wayne I'm sorry buddy I'm so sorry I I he looked at me with a smile on his face he said don't worry about it said the Lord came down on the Dozer about 2:00 said I'm going to do something significant is that the word very significant tonight man you just feel it settle over I have one more thing to say I said brother Wayne a about 205 why didn't you tell me we went to church that night my mom had just had her first brain bleed was in a in a real bad situation couldn't hardly walk couldn't hardly take care of herself and and she wanted to come to church that night cuz brother Wayne by her favorite preacher is just the way what it was and so she asked Dad you think I can come he said look he said they brought people in in whe chairs and Cs and every kind of thing brother Brown sure he said we're going to have prayer line tonight that was his his testimony already to to my mom and said we going to have prayer God's going to do something it's already working and so we get to church that night I Le the songs brother Wayne comes out preaches and somewhere right right middle ways it just changes and the Lord takes over and things begin to happen but and usually I take the end of the service but God knew better than let me have the end of that service cuz I wasn't quite in the spirit I've been dealing with that dunk man don't don't forget I'm just being honest with you and here brother brother Tim walks up to the platform he says we're going to have a prayer line tonight everybody has a need tonight's your night it lined up the back door we didn't get done to almost 1:00 in the morning that night God did something very significant there was a little boy that was covered in his body with warts and and in just a moment few days they were all gone praise God my mom had been so weak she couldn't even hardly stand up and Dad told her you sit in my office when I feel the time right I'll bring you out he brought her out they prayed for her for two and a half hours she stood right over there on the side with her hands lifted up praising God but this little girl Kimberly amen 16y old girl come down she said brother Wayne I want my brother she said I want my family back together the devil's comeing separated us we want I want God to move they pray for her and I'm leading the singing Spirit of God's moving about 15 20 minutes I look back and I see Justin coming in the back door draped over some Deacon arms well we find out later he's laying in his bed and it's almost midnight he wakes up and he says Whoa my mom ain't home Kimberly where they at and he begins to really freak out he begins to get all nervous he's tore up and he begins to look and his first thoughts was I missed the Rapture so he gets in his truck now it had been raining he gets in his truck and just flies all the way across town look to another brother to understand goes to another brother's house finally said I got to get to church and he we lived on our church was on a little we'd call it a little Cattle Trail kind of a road little one lane basically Road and then he comes flying down through there runs off the road takes out about a 100 foot of fence there a brother out on the porch he's rocking his baby cuz it's almost midnight prayer line still going on Miracle as Miracles were taking place and here here he is he comes flying in the church and just his truck died right there had to tow it he falls out of the truck and he's screaming I got to get right with God I got another chance they're still here I got to get right with God and he starts get I want to get right with God and he starts coming in the deacons grab and they bring him to within about 20 minutes of that little girl's prayer Justin came in the back door and let me tell you that's been what 2014 or somewhere around there almost 10 years ago and that boy is still serving God today got a wife and a child coming down amen why cuz God the lamb had prevailed he turned her weeping into Joy Hallelujah I believe he's here to do it this morning he's here to turn weeping you've been weeping for a while but God is here to turn it into Joy Hallelujah this morning he can do it he's the same yesterday today and forever you say what about my son what about my daughter he's the same God and my Bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever that's right he'll turn your weeping into Joy Amen to allow you to see it ain't as bad as what you you really think it is why can you say that brother Timothy cuz the lamb prevailed what about my sickness the lamb prevailed what about my children the lamb prevailed what about my situation the lamb prevailed what about my marriage the lamb prevailed what about my home the lamb prevailed what about this church the lamb has prevailed what about what about the things you're going through the lamb he took our Stripes he took our pain oh my brother R talks about he says he went down he went down into hell and he goes down there to the souls that were in prison and he said why didn't you hear the voice of Noah why didn't you hear this voice why didn't and he preaches to him and shows him who he is and he said then he descended on down to the hell and he said he knocked on the door of hell and the devil opened up and he started laughing but let me tell you something his laughing didn't last long that's oh God did you catch that his laughing didn't last long neither will your weeping last long going to be a swap take place just like he did with Sarah amen Sarah was Barren she had no child she seemed like there was no hope for her she was past age and Abraham was past age but God had give a promise amen what happened she got that baby Isa she named him Isaac why why she name him Isaac it means laughter here she can hold him and just laugh God's so good I heard that song this morning I just weapon my as I was studying God is so good God is so good amen why why can you look at things and you know since she's holding this baby and she said I'm going to name him laughter what was it showing you God's going to give you the last life that's amen the saying goes who who last laugh last last last best amen the devil's been laughing at you and making fun of you and saying you can't make it you won't make it hahaa you're sick hahaa your son's out there hahaa your daughter's lost ha haa but God's going to give you the last [Music] life Hallelujah God's going to give you last laugh let me say it like this he I don't know where sister Bethany is right now but you didn't name that baby Isaac for no reason or by accident God's going to give you the last laugh his laughing didn't last very long now I got you I've been I thought I had you when I got this one I thought I he said shut up devil I like how he talks just shut up give me a keys he ripped him off of his side brother Brown said he slammed that door so hard in Satan's face it shook the stalagtites of hell hello gave him a good kick just kick the tar out of him football kick just let it rip whack and slam the door in his face and said he rose back started ascending back and he went by paradise and he emptied Paradise they throwed those doors back and Abraham said there he is that's the one that sat with me under the Oaks of aamor there he is Sarah that's the one we saw that day job said there he is I saw him though the skin worms restored my body and my flesh I'll see him and there he is Ezekiel said there he is he's the will in the middle of the will Isaiah said there he is behold unto us a child is born a son is given the Mighty God the counselor there he is and he come back as Victorious and brother said Psalms 9 Psalms said there Psalms said who is the king of glory he's the Lord he's the Conqueror he's more than enough this morning I don't care what you're going through he's here to tell you you don't have to weep no more but I'm going to turn it back to rejoicing and this is where John when he turned and he saw that lamb that was worthy the Bible says the Bible says he saw him and he heard them begin to CL begin to worship Him and and the atmospheres begin to change it went from weeping to John shouting and they sang a new song I preached that here at the Youth Camp they sang a new song why because now they wasn't looking at what was unworthy they were looking at what was worthy if you'll stop looking at what's unworthy and start looking at what's worthy you'll sing a new song I said it you quit you quit singing well I'm depressed I'm depressed every day that I live I'm depressed when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head to rest I'm depressed why you're looking at what's unworthy but if you look to the lamb you better say I blessed I am blessed every day that I live I am blessed when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head to rest I'm blessed Hallelujah listen he's trying to turn us from our weeping into Joy brother Wayne saying sing that song as I come up down from his glory that song right there means that world to me I won't hardly sing it unless I know the atmosphere is right it was right this morning sacred moment that God was see fit to come down and show us himself I was there brother Ron Spencer's preaching and I walked away from my P iPad didn't have a watch at that time that could operate it it went dark I'm preaching preaching about the three Hebrew children and I was speaking about the king he threw him into the fire and God has he how the angels and God was watching and he said this is for me and he took a zigzag of light and the boat of lightning and head of Thunder went on down and as soon as they went into the fire he came down and when I said that my iPad went off and the voice of the Prophet began to speak and he began to speak about he said that's the favorite of the hymns he said Bruth cber wrote it in a cornfield and he said because it expresses the extreme dear to the Lord Jesus Christ especially in the day that we're living in it was out of the out of the message I can't remember the title of it but about the woman who watch jesus' feet and I begin to realize God is wanting our worship that's what he wants but he don't want it out of a form or out of a got to or it's a Sunday again no I want to worship him because he's done so many great things for me amen amen I thought you know I thought at that moment my mom was healed I thought man God spoke it's over I was looking for an answer and I thought that's it but that was wasn't the answer go God was given she would later go on but I would go from that service and we' have a little anniversary and then we'd go meet brother Wayne and brother Josh's and pre preaches meeting together brother R Wayne would preach a sermon on you're in line for a miracle I took it I said yes I'm in line for a miracle God's going to do it and she had been out of the hospital for a few days and but I was flying back in from that meeting and I landed she'd go back in the hospital and she would never come out again and there I was broken as she would pass away and I'm thinking God how I saw you do thing I I went to I went to a room right after I got back and and I and I knew God had spoke and I knew God was doing things and I knew God had answered and I just knew God was coming on the scene and here she was laying in a comos condition for 17 hours had not spoke to nobody just staring at the ceiling and I said Mom I'm here to tell you he's come down but way she turned her face toward me she goes down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger sang that whole verse and she lifted up those hands she goes oh how how I love him oh how I adore him just broke into tears I thought man it's over with she she spoke she ain't spoke in 17 hours she sang me this song she She didn't even know all this was going on and she picked all the songs of the world that's what she saying to me thought it's over with that ain't the way God answered who would take her take her on into the other real and I was sitting there about two pews back at her a dedic at her her Memorial and I'm just weeping inside of myself like god wow how how I thought it was going to be over I thought you answered and I thought he was come down and the voice of God spoke to me he said I didn't C I didn't do all that for her I did it for you I wanted you to know I was in the fire with you I wanted you to know I have come down in your fire and I'm with you and you won't
