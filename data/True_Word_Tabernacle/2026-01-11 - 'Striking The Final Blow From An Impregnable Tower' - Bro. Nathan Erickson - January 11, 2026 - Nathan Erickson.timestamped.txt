[11:58] morning.
[12:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Want [music] to
[12:01] go to the Lord in prayer. Welcome each
[12:03] one to the service this morning. May God
[12:05] bless you. [music]
[12:06] We're certainly happy to have all our
[12:08] guests here among us. May the Lord bless
[12:11] you for for your efforts and for being
[12:14] with us [music] and the saints of God
[12:16] that have been gathered together this
[12:18] weekend. We're thank the [music] Lord
[12:20] for what he has done among us. Amen. We
[12:23] give him all the praise for that.
[12:26] We
[12:28] brother Josh and [music] sister Megan
[12:30] Collins want to thank the Lord. Little
[12:32] baby Dawson is in [music] church for the
[12:34] first time today. They say, "We want to
[12:36] thank the Lord publicly and express our
[12:39] appreciation for our pastor and his
[12:41] wife, our church family, and all that
[12:42] have prayed for Megan and Dawson over
[12:45] the last several months. [music]
[12:47] We have countless testimonies we could
[12:49] share, but to name a few. When Megan was
[12:51] first admitted to the hospital, she had
[12:53] gone in the night before she was
[12:55] transferred to Dayton, [music] but we
[12:57] were sent home. She ended up going back
[12:59] in that following morning because she
[13:01] felt something wasn't right. And when
[13:03] she arrived to labor and delivery, the
[13:05] nurse and doctors [music]
[13:06] couldn't believe she was sent home the
[13:08] night before. The nurse pulled her lab
[13:10] results that were [music] from the
[13:11] previous night, and her words were, "You
[13:13] were easily at stroke conditions."
[13:15] [music] They transferred to Dayton that
[13:17] day and told us she'd be in the hospital
[13:20] until she delivered, whenever that would
[13:22] be. But the team of doctors [music]
[13:24] wanted to do all we could to get to get
[13:27] her to 34 weeks for Dawson's lung
[13:29] development. She was in the hospital on
[13:32] preeacclampsia [music] protocol for 6
[13:34] days before she started having vision
[13:35] changes, severe headaches, [music] and
[13:37] some other concerning symptoms. When
[13:40] they rechecked her lab, she was entering
[13:42] beginning stages of [music] organ
[13:43] failure. So at 32 weeks, they
[13:46] immediately transferred us to labor and
[13:48] delivery to begin induction. We were
[13:50] very concerned because they [music] told
[13:52] us Dawson would be in NICU at the
[13:54] minimum of his due date, which was
[13:56] Christmas Eve. Once Dawson was born,
[13:59] they had told us that his blood sugars
[14:01] would be extremely unstable and he would
[14:03] need help controlling them. [music] They
[14:05] stopped checking his blood sugar after
[14:06] less than 24 hours because they [music]
[14:09] were perfect every time. They told us he
[14:11] would be on CPAP or be intubated for a
[14:14] minimum of a month because [music] of
[14:15] baby lungs just don't develop sooner
[14:18] than that if be if born before 34 weeks.
[14:21] [music] He came completely off a CPAP 12
[14:24] days after being born and never required
[14:26] intubation. When we began bottle
[14:29] feeding, Megan was learning how to do
[14:31] his feeds. And the nurse that day told
[14:33] her, "Now, don't be afraid or worried
[14:36] when when [music] he spits or chokes. It
[14:37] will happen, and it's very normal."
[14:40] Megan told her, "Well, I've heard that
[14:42] if I just don't want to see him deal
[14:44] with that. [music] I I I've heard that,
[14:47] but I just don't want to see him deal
[14:48] with that, so I'm believing he won't."
[14:50] The nurse started his first [music]
[14:52] bottle feed and after he drank the first
[14:54] ounce with no choking or spits, she gave
[14:56] Dawson to Megan and let her complete the
[14:58] feeding. When Dawson finished the
[15:00] [music] entire bottle, the nurse looked
[15:01] at Megan with the most confused look on
[15:03] her face. Her words were, "This makes no
[15:06] sense. I've worked in a NICU for 12
[15:08] years and I've never seen a baby with
[15:09] the first bottle feed not choke." The
[15:12] doctors came in for rounds. And his
[15:14] doctor that morning didn't believe the
[15:15] nurse when she gave report. He looked at
[15:18] Megan and said, "I just can't believe
[15:19] how well he [music] did. This is not the
[15:21] normal for a 32- week baby." Megan said,
[15:25] "Sir, our baby is one of the most prayed
[15:27] for [music] babies in the world right
[15:28] now. You may be surprised, but I'm not."
[15:31] Dawson was born [music] October 31st.
[15:33] They told us we would spend Christmas in
[15:35] NICU, but we were [music] home 8 days
[15:37] before Thanksgiving. Thank you to all
[15:40] that sent money, gift cards, [music]
[15:42] flowers, texts, and calls, but most
[15:44] importantly, your love and prayers. We
[15:46] love you all and are so happy to have
[15:48] our whole family here [music] today for
[15:50] the first time. Josh, Megan, Riley,
[15:53] Ellie, and Dawson. Praise the Lord for
[15:56] that. We thank God. [applause]
[15:58] Amen.
[16:01] [applause]
[16:04] Praise the Lord.
[16:10] [applause]
[16:13] Thank God [music] for his keeping power.
[16:15] Amen.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; When there seemth not to be a way, he
[16:19] makes a way.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Are y'all happy about that?
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Are y'all happy about that?
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:29] If the brothers will come, but we're
[16:31] receiving the missions offering this
[16:32] morning. [music]
[16:36] Brother Joel Strike says, "I just want
[16:38] to share something that the Lord
[16:40] answered my prayer last week. I almost
[16:42] wrote a prayer request last week that
[16:43] [music] the rain would not hinder my job
[16:46] because I work in construction and we
[16:48] are exposed [music] to the elements.
[16:49] Last week the forecast looked like we
[16:51] would only get 3 days of work, but
[16:54] praise God, he made a way for me to get
[16:56] six [music] days of work. Hallelujah. He
[16:58] cares about everything that we are
[17:00] concerned about and he is always making
[17:01] a way for us. [music]
[17:03] Thank the Lord.
[17:07] I have a request here. I know some are
[17:09] out sick this morning. And so let's
[17:11] remember those that are unable [music]
[17:13] to be here. Sister Mary Lewis would
[17:16] appreciate prayer for two [music]
[17:17] pressure sores that are in a different
[17:20] area than before. Pray they heal
[17:22] quickly. [music] So let's remember
[17:25] Sister Mary Lewis in prayer. Brother
[17:27] Troy, would you come lead us to the
[17:28] Lord?
[17:33] Let's our hearts. our gracious heavenly
[17:35] father. Lord, we just want to give you
[17:38] praise and glory and honor for this this
[17:39] morning the opportunity that we'd have
[17:41] to come together, Lord, once again,
[17:43] Lord, and just to worship you, Lord, and
[17:45] to and to exalt your name, Lord, above
[17:48] all other names, Lord, we're just so
[17:50] thankful for your grace and your mercy
[17:52] in our lives.
[17:53] And Lord, as we [music] Lord see these
[17:56] needs Lord Lord many times Lord in our
[17:59] humanity Lord we'd like to just put our
[18:01] hands on them Lord and and maybe Lord
[18:04] Lord but we recognize that we have no
[18:05] ability of our own Father there's
[18:07] nothing that we could do Father and and
[18:09] Lord recently Lord I just been thinking
[18:10] of that scripture Father Lord [music] as
[18:12] the uh word Lord come to the prophet
[18:14] Zechariah Lord and he would begin to cry
[18:16] that not by might nor by power but by my
[18:19] spirit sayeth [music] the Lord and and
[18:21] Lord that's what we're depending on this
[18:23] morning, Lord, is that great Holy Spirit
[18:24] to come, Lord, and do the impossible,
[18:27] Lord. And Lord, it was your spirit,
[18:29] Lord, that brought little [music]
[18:30] Dawson, Lord, through that, Lord,
[18:32] delivery and the the early stages,
[18:35] Father. And Lord, it's your spirit that
[18:37] comes time and time again, Lord, and
[18:38] [music] and ministers to the needs just
[18:40] as we saw last night and even Friday,
[18:42] Lord, it's your spirit, Father. Lord,
[18:45] and we're just trusting, Lord, in you
[18:46] this morning for each of these needs,
[18:48] Lord. And [music] and Lord, I know that
[18:49] you're not done, Lord, this weekend,
[18:51] Lord. I know that this morning there's
[18:52] still needs, Lord. And Lord, we're
[18:54] expecting you, Father, to meet each one,
[18:56] Lord. Lord, we've gathered, Lord,
[18:58] together, Lord, to Lord, to just to pull
[19:00] on your word this morning, Lord, and to
[19:02] draw, Father, from from you, Lord. Lord,
[19:05] I'm just so thankful, Father, for Lord,
[19:07] the grace that you've given, Lord, and
[19:08] the the [music] price that you've paid,
[19:10] Lord, that we could, Lord, be a free
[19:12] people, Father. Lord, and and Lord,
[19:15] [music] that we know that you're willing
[19:17] and able, Lord, for each of these needs,
[19:18] Lord. our sister Mary Lewis, Father, the
[19:20] the [music]
[19:21] source there, Lord. I just pray, Father,
[19:22] that you would just minister, Father,
[19:24] Lord, to her. And Lord, that you would
[19:26] just, Lord, just give her grace, Father.
[19:28] May you just show her mercy, Lord,
[19:30] [music] and Lord, all the needs, Lord
[19:32] Jesus. We just pray, Father, that you
[19:34] would just, Lord, just take control,
[19:36] Lord, of every situation, Lord. We're
[19:37] just putting our trust in you, Lord.
[19:39] [music] Pray bless the missionary
[19:40] offering, Lord. We just ask that you
[19:42] would just, Lord, just further the work,
[19:44] Lord, our brothers that go from here,
[19:45] [music] Father, to many areas, Lord.
[19:47] Lord, we think of our brother Zachary
[19:48] Wallace this morning, Lord. Lord, may
[19:50] you just anoint him, Father. And we,
[19:52] [music] Lord, and just inspire him,
[19:53] Lord, and just, Lord, may you just,
[19:55] Lord, lead him and guide him, Lord, as
[19:57] he would, Lord, minister, Father, and to
[19:59] spread this message, Lord. May you just
[20:00] be with him, we pray. We just commit all
[20:03] things [music] to you. We commit this
[20:04] service to you. We give it all to you in
[20:06] the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[20:08] Amen.

[43:08] And she said it had been there for about
[43:09] a year
[43:13] and it it started getting bigger about a
[43:16] month or so ago.
[43:19] So we went to praying.
[43:21] She went to the doctor.
[43:24] The doctor said, "That looks pretty
[43:26] bad." And referred her to a
[43:28] dermatologist.
[43:31] And she was supposed to have went to the
[43:33] doctor this past Monday.
[43:36] But the week before that, I'll say about
[43:38] Tuesday or Wednesday, the thing just
[43:41] drained and dissolved and it's gone.

[50:24] or the culture, but Amen. We're we're
[50:26] here, Brother Wayne, because we believe
[50:27] in your ministry. We believe God has
[50:29] anointed you. And it's a revelation to
[50:31] me personally, something God has
[50:33] personally spoken to [music] me that
[50:35] Brother Wayne is the one who's meant to
[50:37] be my pastor to lead my family on to the
[50:39] coming of the Lord. And we appreciate
[50:41] [music] the leadership that we've had.
[50:43] And uh and so it's just an a blessing to
[50:46] be here and to have a part in what the
[50:48] Lord is doing here in Tabernacle. If
[50:50] it's true what Brother Wayne said one
[50:52] time that I [music] could have maybe
[50:54] done other things with my life or been
[50:56] other people, I wouldn't want to. I uh
[51:00] &gt;&gt; I I just believe that God is doing a
[51:02] special work right here in this church
[51:04] and
[51:05] &gt;&gt; I want to be any part of it that I can
[51:07] be.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe in the mission. Amen. I
[51:10] love you all. God bless you. Let's go to
[51:12] the word of God in [music] Judges the
[51:14] 9th chapter this morning.
[51:27] Well, what I have on my heart to do
[51:28] today
[51:31] is just to proclaim the victory
[51:34] &gt;&gt; that has already come and then we'll go
[51:36] home happy. How's that sound?
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this story in the book of
[51:41] Judges. Have maybe referenced it in
[51:43] ministry before. I hope that we could
[51:45] just bring it out today just the way
[51:48] just in the way that I see it because it
[51:50] means so much to me for this hour.
[51:53] Judges chapter 9, we'll start at verse
[51:55] 50.
[51:57] Now, this is uh comes at the end of the
[51:59] story of a king named Aimilec. There's
[52:02] so much you could go into in this story.
[52:04] Uh but Aimilec was a wicked king. He was
[52:07] a slayer of brethren.
[52:09] um he he uh he he slayed all the sons of
[52:13] Gideon and uh proclaimed himself his
[52:16] very name means my father is king. So he
[52:19] was not trying to just be a judge as
[52:20] they had in that time. He was he wanted
[52:22] to be a king, a slayer of the brethren.
[52:25] And so this wicked king, the scripture
[52:27] says, went to the encamped against the
[52:31] took it. But there was a strong tower
[52:35] within the city. And thither fled all
[52:37] the men and women and all they of the
[52:39] city, and shut it to them, and got them
[52:41] up to the top of the tower. And Aimilec
[52:44] came to the tower, and fought against
[52:46] it, and went hard unto the door of the
[52:49] tower to burn it with fire.
[52:51] And a certain woman
[52:54] cast a piece of a millstone upon
[52:56] Aimilec's head, and all to break his
[52:59] skull. Then he called hastily unto the
[53:02] young man his armor bearer, and said
[53:03] unto him, "Draw thy sword, and slay me,
[53:06] that men say not of me." A woman slew
[53:09] him. And his young man thrust him
[53:11] through, and he died. Now, if uh I know
[53:15] you've been standing, but if you turn
[53:16] also to 1 Corinthians chapter 15,
[53:19] we'll just read toward the end here at
[53:21] verse 49 of 1 Corinthians 15.
[53:34] Paul says, "And as we have borne the
[53:36] image of the earthly,
[53:39] we shall also bear the image of the
[53:41] heavenly.
[53:42] Now this I say, brethren, flesh and
[53:44] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[53:49] Neither does corruption inherit
[53:51] incorruption. But behold, I show you a
[53:54] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[53:57] shall all be changed in a moment, in the
[54:00] twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.
[54:03] For the trumpet shall sound, and the
[54:05] dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
[54:07] we shall be changed. For this in For
[54:09] this corruptible must put on
[54:12] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[54:14] on immortality. Now when this
[54:17] corruptible shall put on incorruption,
[54:20] and this mortal shall have put on
[54:21] immortality, then
[54:24] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[54:28] is written, "Death is swallowed up in
[54:30] victory. Oh death, where is thy sting?
[54:34] Oh grave, where is thy victory?"
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize, Amen. that when this
[54:40] body change happens, then shall be
[54:43] brought to pass this saying. Amen. I
[54:46] want to preach this morning uh on
[54:48] striking the final blow from an
[54:51] impregnable tower. Amen. It's kind of an
[54:54] ambitious title. I'm going to need your
[54:55] help to preach today. Amen. Let's let's
[54:57] just pray. Lord Jesus, what a wonderful
[55:00] weekend that we've had together, Lord.
[55:02] We just thank you, Lord. Lord, you're so
[55:05] faithful to come time after time and
[55:07] move amongst us by your spirit.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; All we can say is, Lord, let it not
[55:11] become common to us. Lord, may you
[55:14] always be welcome here in our midst,
[55:16] Father. May there be a place for you in
[55:18] this church to come, Lord, and open up
[55:20] your word, Lord, and let the quickening
[55:22] power, Father, spark it to life amongst
[55:25] us, Lord. We love your appearing. We
[55:27] love your manifestation, Lord. We love
[55:29] your presence. We just ask you would
[55:30] come once more, Father. Lord, I I uh
[55:34] Lord, I I have no ability today, Lord,
[55:36] but in Christ, I can do all things,
[55:38] Father. You give me strength, Lord. And
[55:41] you see my heart, Lord, to to serve
[55:43] these people, Father. Lord, and I see,
[55:45] Lord, what you've laid on my heart. And
[55:47] Lord, just hearing the preaching all
[55:48] this weekend, to see the continuity,
[55:50] Lord, to see, Lord, the the how it
[55:52] dovetales together, Lord. Gives me
[55:54] courage today, Lord. That you want to
[55:56] say something to your people. I pray,
[55:57] Lord, you just help us all to get out of
[55:59] the way. That you could come on the
[56:00] scene and have your way amongst us,
[56:02] Lord, and say what you would want to
[56:03] say. And let us see the picture just
[56:05] right, Father. Lord, you put something
[56:07] in my hand today. I want to strike a
[56:09] blow against the enemy. Help us, Lord,
[56:11] we pray and come amongst us once more in
[56:14] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you as
[56:16] you're seated today. Striking the final
[56:18] blow from an impregnable tower. Amen.
[56:23] You know, we find first of all as we
[56:24] look at this uh as we look at the
[56:27] picture of this story in the book of
[56:28] Judges of a siege of the slaying of a
[56:31] king and amen. uh we want to we want to
[56:34] position ourselves in this story and
[56:36] find ourselves here in the word of God.
[56:38] Amen. And so you firstly we got to we to
[56:41] position ourselves the first thing we
[56:42] got to recognize and maybe I'll take
[56:44] about the first half of this sermon uh
[56:46] to deal with it is that we have a tower
[56:49] today. Amen. The Bible says that the
[56:51] name of the Lord is a strong tower. And
[56:54] I'm so glad friends in a world where
[56:56] everything's falling apart. There's
[56:58] nothing firm. There's nothing that can
[56:59] stand. It seems like everything is
[57:01] shaken. But we have one place, amen,
[57:04] that cannot be affected by the falling
[57:06] part of the world. Amen. A strong tower.
[57:09] It's a place of refuge. It's a place of
[57:11] safety. And I'm so glad that God gave it
[57:13] to us. And that's why, you know, we come
[57:15] and we that's one of the the great
[57:17] reasons why we lift up the name of Jesus
[57:19] Christ, you know, because the higher
[57:21] he's lifted up, the higher we're lifted
[57:23] up because we are placed and positioned
[57:25] and identified in that name. And I love
[57:28] that name of Jesus, you know. Amen.
[57:30] There's there's there's no other name
[57:31] like that name. There's no there's no
[57:33] other identity or identification that
[57:36] means what it means. Amen. That the name
[57:38] of Jesus, Amen, should be lifted up in
[57:40] all the earth there. Amen. Not everybody
[57:42] can recognize it like we can recognize
[57:44] it. But there will come a day when every
[57:46] knee will bow and every tongue will
[57:48] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Amen.
[57:52] I lift up the name of Jesus today. The
[57:54] name of Jesus is so high cancer can't
[57:56] get over it. Amen. The name of Jesus is
[57:58] so wide that trials of life can't get
[58:00] around it and drag you out of that place
[58:02] of safety. There's nothing that can
[58:04] touch you if you're behind that name of
[58:06] Jesus. The name of Jesus is so deep,
[58:08] Amen. that your deepest fears and your
[58:11] deepest feelings and the most profound
[58:13] and and darkest places that you GO
[58:16] THROUGH, AMEN, CANNOT get under that
[58:17] name of Jesus. Amen. I I lift up that
[58:20] name. YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE AMEN. OUTSIDE OF
[58:23] this name, the whole world is falling
[58:24] apart and everything's coming to
[58:26] nothing. But in Christ, everything is
[58:28] fine. Amen. Everything is wonderful.
[58:30] Everything is peace and everything is
[58:32] joy to be in the name of Jesus. You
[58:34] know, Amen. The only mistake that we
[58:36] could make in this day is to get out
[58:38] from behind that name. Amen. God has
[58:40] opened up a an identification for the
[58:42] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. That we
[58:44] would have a place of safety today. The
[58:46] message is a place of safety. Amen.
[58:48] Brother Brandon would say that Eve, she
[58:50] had a great fortress. Amen. of the word
[58:52] of God. And as long as she stayed behind
[58:54] that fortress, she was safe. She was in
[58:56] paradise. She was in Eden. Amen. The
[58:59] only mistake that Eve made, Brother Bram
[59:00] said, she got out from behind that great
[59:03] fortress of his word. As long as she
[59:05] stayed behind the word, he said
[59:06] everything was fine. And he said, "And
[59:08] we make our mistake when we get out from
[59:11] behind the word." Amen. So, we want to
[59:13] be in that name. We want to be
[59:15] identified in it. Brother Brandham, one
[59:17] of the most quoted things he ever
[59:18] quotes, he says, "Now, how do you get
[59:19] into Christ?" Amen. It's not it's not a
[59:22] you know it's not a 10-step plan. It's
[59:25] not a real complicated process. The
[59:27] Bible said by one spirit we are all
[59:30] baptized into one body. Amen. One Lord,
[59:33] one faith, one family, one name given
[59:35] under heaven WHEREBY MEN MAY BE SAVED.
[59:38] AMEN. AH. AMEN. Behind the name of
[59:40] Jesus. I would like to say today if
[59:42] YOU'RE IN TRUE WORD TABERNACLE AND YOUR
[59:44] IDENTITY today is as a member of True
[59:46] Word Tabernacle, I want to say that
[59:48] we're glad to have you. But I want to
[59:50] warn you today, you're not safe here in
[59:52] True Word Tabernacle. AMEN. OH MY. BUT
[59:54] GOD SENT A MESSAGE AND YOU COULD GO
[59:56] BEYOND THE CHURCH AND GET INTO CHRIST.
[59:59] AMEN. IT'S NOT SAFE HERE, FRIENDS. AMEN.
[1:00:02] WE DIDN'T LEAVE THE METHODIST CHURCH TO
[1:00:03] JOIN A MESSAGE ORGANIZATION. WE'RE NOT
[1:00:06] HERE TO BUILD AN ORGANIZATION. WE'RE NOT
[1:00:08] HERE TO CREATE A NEW TRADITION. WE'RE
[1:00:10] NOT HERE TO START A NEW MOVEMENT. AMEN.
[1:00:12] WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:00:14] HOUR, AMEN, PUT A WATCHMAN IN THE TOWER
[1:00:16] HAS SAID IF YOU, AMEN, ARE TRYING TO
[1:00:19] FIND YOUR SAFETY IN THE CHURCH THAT YOU
[1:00:21] BELONG TO AND THE TRADITIONS THAT YOU
[1:00:23] HOLD DEAR, COME OUT OF HER AND GET INTO
[1:00:26] CHRIST. AMEN. BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY
[1:00:28] PLACE OF SAFETY IN THIS DAY.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:00:34] IS NOT A QUESTION OF MEMBERSHIP. IT'S
[1:00:36] NOT A QUESTION of association. It is a
[1:00:38] question of identity. And I want to take
[1:00:41] some time today to deal with the this
[1:00:43] subject of identification. Amen. Because
[1:00:45] you know, you realize that brother man
[1:00:47] would tell us there's only two towers
[1:00:49] you can try to hide in. One of them is
[1:00:51] the strong tower, the name of Jesus
[1:00:53] Christ. And the and all the rest of it
[1:00:55] is the tower of babel. Amen. And the
[1:00:57] tower of babel cannot stand, friends. In
[1:01:00] other words, what man can do will never
[1:01:02] stand. What man can build, what man can
[1:01:04] organize, what man can think, what man
[1:01:06] CAN FIGURE OUT WILL NEVER STAND. AMEN.
[1:01:09] BUT IF YOU COULD GET OUT FROM UNDER
[1:01:11] MAN'S ABILITY AND GET OUT OF JUST GET
[1:01:13] OUT JUST PUT IT OUT OF YOUR MIND THE
[1:01:15] IDEA OF I CAN OR I MUST OR I WILL. AMEN.
[1:01:18] AND GET TO THIS TOWER THAT I'M TALKING
[1:01:20] ABOUT. AMEN. THEN YOU'LL BE SAFE. AMEN.
[1:01:23] IN A SAFETY LIKE YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. What man can do can never
[1:01:27] survive the ages.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; But God has provided a place.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; God's chosen place of worship. Amen. I'd
[1:01:34] like you to read this one with me. Just
[1:01:36] set the tone today. Brother Bran said,
[1:01:38] "Church, wherever you are and what you
[1:01:42] belong to, it makes no difference. But
[1:01:45] there's one thing you must know. You've
[1:01:47] got to be in Christ
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; or you're dead.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; You can't live outside of him. Your
[1:01:52] church might be all right as a building.
[1:01:54] Your fellowship might be all right as
[1:01:56] man, but when you deny the body, the
[1:01:58] blood, the word of Jesus Christ, you're
[1:02:00] dead the minute you do it because that's
[1:02:02] God's chosen place of worship. There is
[1:02:04] where his name is exactly. That's where
[1:02:06] he chose to put his name not in the
[1:02:08] church but in the son Jesus Christ. Now
[1:02:11] what we say now now we all have this
[1:02:14] tendency sometimes or brother man say we
[1:02:16] say the church the great mighty church
[1:02:19] she did this and she did that and she's
[1:02:22] weighed the storms and we've picked up
[1:02:24] in population. We're we're great in
[1:02:26] numbers and we're a mighty church and
[1:02:28] she is a great thing. But brother Brand
[1:02:30] I'm so glad brother Brand said God never
[1:02:32] said anything about a she. And he said
[1:02:34] him, him is the meeting place, the lamb,
[1:02:38] NOT THE CHURCH, NOT HER NAME, BUT HIS
[1:02:41] NAME. [laughter] AND HE DIDN'T PUT HER
[1:02:43] name anywhere. He put his name in him.
[1:02:45] And that's WHY ALL THAT WE DO in word or
[1:02:48] deed, we must do it all in the name of
[1:02:51] JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. THAT'S THE ANSWER,
[1:02:53] FRIENDS. AMEN. It's not your name, MY
[1:02:55] NAME, OUR CHURCH, SOMEBODY ELSE'S
[1:02:57] CHURCH, WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHO WE CAN BE
[1:03:00] AND WHAT SHE HAS DONE. AMEN. BUT IT'S
[1:03:02] ALL IN HIM. IN HIM IS OUR SAFETY. AMEN.
[1:03:05] I KNOW WE'RE LIVING IN A world that puts
[1:03:07] a lot of pressure on a believer. We all
[1:03:09] feel the pressure of the age. Amen. Our
[1:03:11] young people are growing up in a world,
[1:03:13] amen, that's pressing on them all the
[1:03:15] time. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM gave us an
[1:03:17] answer to pressure. And is, Amen.
[1:03:19] There's a WAY THAT YOU CAN LET OFF THE
[1:03:20] PRESSURE. AND HIS ANSWER, AMEN, IS TO
[1:03:23] GET INTO THE NAME OF THE LORD. AMEN. AND
[1:03:25] IF YOU CAN FIND THAT PLACE OF SAFETY,
[1:03:27] AMEN. IT IS THE ANSWER TO PRESSURE. I
[1:03:30] KNOW WE feel pressure today. Amen.
[1:03:31] Because of our high calling. Amen. We
[1:03:34] feel pressure today because we know we
[1:03:35] are to be the bride OF JESUS CHRIST. AS
[1:03:38] WE HEARD LAST NIGHT, you know, uh uh
[1:03:40] brother brother Arie dealt with this so
[1:03:41] so adeptly. AMEN. THAT WHEN YOU BEGIN to
[1:03:43] preach the bride's position and that the
[1:03:45] son of man ministry is in her AND THAT
[1:03:48] CHRIST, AMEN, has come in the formation
[1:03:50] of the bride today. Amen. And there are
[1:03:52] mighty works that we are to do and a
[1:03:54] mighty people that WE ARE TO BE. IT
[1:03:56] BEGINS TO PUT A PRESSURE IF YOU DON'T
[1:03:58] SEE IT RIGHT. BUT YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND,
[1:04:00] EVEN THOUGH SHE WILL DO THE GREATER
[1:04:02] WORKS, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS TO BE HIM,
[1:04:04] EVEN THOUGH SHE, AMEN, IS TO IS TO
[1:04:07] MANIFEST HIS ATTRIBUTES, IT STILL HAS
[1:04:09] NOTHING TO DO WITH HER. IT'S ALL ABOUT
[1:04:12] HIM. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT THE MESSAGE CAME
[1:04:14] TO DO, TO PULL US OUT OF OUR OF OUR
[1:04:17] ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY AND IDENTIFY US
[1:04:20] WITH JESUS CHRIST FOR THIS DAY.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT LETS OFF THE PRESSURE
[1:04:25] WHEN YOU'RE identified in Christ. I'll
[1:04:27] tell you what to overcome today. How
[1:04:29] many How many want to be an overcomer?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, if this word identification
[1:04:33] doesn't mean anything to you, Amen. I
[1:04:35] tell you this is absolutely crucial to
[1:04:38] be an overcomer today. I I dare say you
[1:04:40] will not overcome Leodysa. Amen. Without
[1:04:43] a revelation of your identification.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Can I rattle off some quotes today?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Israel and the church. Brother Ram said,
[1:04:50] "If you're justified in Christ, you are
[1:04:52] glorified in Christ already
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; as far as God's concerned."
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be therefore perfect even
[1:04:59] as your father in heaven is perfect."
[1:05:01] How could you ever BE PERFECT?
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; HOW? COME ON, CHURCH. HOW COULD YOU EVER
[1:05:05] BE PERFECT?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; BUT IN THE SIGHT OF CHRIST TONIGHT,
[1:05:09] EVERY BORNAGAIN CHRISTIAN IS PERFECT.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAID, "I'M JUST IN AS
[1:05:14] PERFECT IN GOD AS CHRIST WAS, and you
[1:05:17] are too. EVERY OTHER BELIEVER. FOR IT'S
[1:05:20] NOT MY HOLINESS, IT'S HIS HOLINESS.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD CANNOT ACCEPT MINE. I have
[1:05:26] none. But I come in Christ by faith and
[1:05:29] by Christ I'm in him
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; and I'm perfect in the sight of God. In
[1:05:34] the message law of grace, brother Ben
[1:05:36] said, "Now it isn't what I can do. It
[1:05:38] isn't whether I'm good or not. It's
[1:05:41] whether he was good. I can never BE GOOD
[1:05:44] ENOUGH TO MAKE IT."
[1:05:46] HOW MANY? SOMEBODY ACCEPT THAT TODAY. I
[1:05:49] CAN NEVER be good enough to make it.
[1:05:52] Amen. But but listen, HE SAID YOU CAN'T
[1:05:54] be good enough to make it. IF YOU EVER
[1:05:57] MAKE IT, AMEN. YOU'LL STAND IN THE
[1:05:59] merits of Jesus Christ. Amen. In the
[1:06:03] innervale, brother Bam said, "Most
[1:06:04] people that profess Christianity have
[1:06:07] such a hard, struggling time to hold
[1:06:09] on." How many ever felt like you were
[1:06:11] struggling to hold on? I know that I
[1:06:13] have. Brother Bram said, he said, "It's
[1:06:15] it's because," Amen. He said, "It's
[1:06:17] because of a lack of correct teaching. I
[1:06:20] want to get taught today." How many like
[1:06:22] to learn a lesson from the prophet of
[1:06:24] God? Brother Brham said, "I'm going
[1:06:25] about to teach you." Amen. Uh uh uh why
[1:06:28] you feel like you're struggling to hold
[1:06:29] on. Brother, here's the correct
[1:06:31] teaching. BROTHER BRAM SAID, "THERE'S NO
[1:06:33] SUCH A THING AS HOLDING ON." He did the
[1:06:36] holding on. THE WHOLE CHRISTIAN
[1:06:38] PRINCIPLE IS BASED UPON REST. THOSE WHO
[1:06:42] HE HAS CALLED, HE HAS JUSTIFIED. THOSE
[1:06:45] WHO HE HAS JUSTIFIED, HE HAS ALREADY
[1:06:48] GLORIFIED. AMEN. IT IS NOTHING THAT YOU
[1:06:52] DO OR WHAT YOU CAN DO. IT'S WHAT GOD HAS
[1:06:55] DONE FOR YOU IN CHRIST,

[1:07:00] RECORD. I'VE GOT A MEMORY. I'VE GOT AN
[1:07:03] ACCUSER. THERE'S THINGS THAT I'VE DONE.
[1:07:05] AMEN. I'M A SINNER. BROTHER BRHAM SAID,
[1:07:07] "HOW CAN YOU BE A SINNER WHEN YOU'RE IN
[1:07:10] THE SINLESS ONE?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; And God can only see him who you are
[1:07:13] in."
[1:07:16] Amen. Rising the sun. Brother man said,
[1:07:19] "Don't say I hope TO MAKE IT.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT."
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we could just dismiss and go
[1:07:25] HOME RIGHT NOW. I'VE ALREADY MADE IT.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; I'VE ALREADY MADE IT. IT'S ALREADY DONE.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Not I will make it. I've already made
[1:07:33] it. I never made it, but he made it for
[1:07:36] me.

[1:07:39] performance,
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're only as good as your worst
[1:07:42] day.

[1:07:45] what you know, Amen. You're only as
[1:07:47] strong as your weakest moment. Amen. But
[1:07:50] you got to know your identification
[1:07:51] today. You got to learn to hide in this
[1:07:53] tower. Amen. GET INTO THIS

[1:08:02] who you are. AMEN. ACCEPT THE
[1:08:04] VINDICATION OF IT AND GET INTO THIS
[1:08:06] TOWER. AND ONCE YOU GET INTO THIS TOWER,
[1:08:09] DON'T REACH YOUR HAND OUT. AMEN. AND TRY
[1:08:11] TO DO SOME WORKS. AMEN. Or the devil
[1:08:13] WILL CUT THAT HAND OFF. AMEN. DON'T
[1:08:15] STICK YOUR HEAD OUT. AMEN. AND TRY TO
[1:08:17] KNOW SOMETHING. AMEN. OR YOU'LL LOSE
[1:08:19] THAT HEAD. AMEN. JUST GET ALL THE WAY
[1:08:21] BEHIND WHAT CHRIST HAS ALREADY DONE FOR
[1:08:23] YOU. AMEN. JUST GET UNDER THE FINISHED
[1:08:25] WORK OF CALVARY. AMEN. JUST GET UNDER A
[1:08:27] VINDICATED WORD AND BE SAFE.

[1:08:32] THAT'S ALL WE GOT to do today, friends.
[1:08:34] Amen. You see, if your again, if your
[1:08:37] security is in your performance, you're
[1:08:39] only as strong as your own strength. But
[1:08:42] if you got a positive confession abiding
[1:08:44] in Christ, Amen. If the profession of
[1:08:46] your life is not what you can do, but
[1:08:48] what Christ did for you. Amen. I'll tell
[1:08:50] you what, you are as indestructible as
[1:08:53] the word is in indestructible. You are
[1:08:55] as infallible as the word is infallible.
[1:08:58] I know where I'm standing. [laughter]
[1:08:59] Amen. You you YOU YOU'RE AS POWERFUL AS
[1:09:01] THE WORD IS POWERFUL. AMEN. Because then
[1:09:04] you're in Christ. AND THAT'S WHERE I

[1:09:08] STARTED THIS MEETING. AMEN. WITH GREATER
[1:09:10] is he that is in me than he that is in
[1:09:12] the world. John 14 WILL TELL YOU, AMEN.
[1:09:15] THAT IF HE'S IN YOU, THAT MEANS YOU'RE
[1:09:17] in him. [laughter]
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'LL BE IN ME AND I'LL BE
[1:09:21] IN YOU. AMEN. AND WE'LL BE A STRONG
[1:09:23] TOWER AGAINST THE ENEMY. WHEN THE ENEMY
[1:09:25] COMES IN LIKE A FLOOD, I'LL LIFT UP A
[1:09:28] STANDARD. CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF
[1:09:29] GLORY,
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; a place of safety, a place of
[1:09:33] protection.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Safe in what the word says about me.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, I know I'm in an
[1:09:40] unredeemed body, but I'm also in Christ.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; So, how holy am I?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if I'm in Christ, I'm
[1:09:48] just as holy as he is holy. I'M JUST AS
[1:09:50] RIGHTEOUS as he is righteous. I'M JUST
[1:09:53] AS ABLE AS HE is able. I HAVE GOT JUST
[1:09:55] AS MUCH POWER AS HE'S GOT POWER. I'M
[1:09:58] JUST AS PERFECT AS HE IS PERFECT. AMEN.
[1:10:00] BECAUSE MY IDENTITY IS NOT IN ME, BUT
[1:10:03] IT'S IN HIM. HALLELUJAH. I'M IN CHRIST
[1:10:05] TODAY. I'M SAFE. THAT'S YOUNG PEOPLE.
[1:10:08] WHEN THE ENEMY COMES TO ACCUSE YOU,
[1:10:10] THAT'S WHERE YOUR SAFETY IS. YOU'LL
[1:10:11] NEVER PROVE TO THE ENEMY WHAT A PERFECT
[1:10:13] LIFE THAT YOU CAN LIVE. AMEN. BUT A
[1:10:15] POSITIVE CONFESSION WILL SAY, "BUT I BUT
[1:10:17] YES, BUT I'M IDENTIFIED IN CHRIST. HE
[1:10:20] SHED HIS BLOOD FOR ME. I WAS THERE ON
[1:10:22] CALVARY. I WAS THERE." AMEN. WHEN HE
[1:10:25] WENT TO THE GRAVE. BUT GLORY TO GOD, I
[1:10:27] WAS THERE WHEN HE ROSE UP OUT OF IT.
[1:10:30] [cheering]
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; I'M ALIVE IN CHRIST. I'M DEAD TO MY
[1:10:32] SINS.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm safe
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; because he lives. I live also.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Nathan, can I sin away my
[1:10:41] grace? Send away my day. Not if you're
[1:10:44] Mrs. Grace.
[1:10:46] [laughter]
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. When you realize your identity,
[1:10:49] you're going to get real Calvinistic.
[1:10:51] Amen. And when you realize who you are,
[1:10:53] friends, that's what this message did
[1:10:55] for you. What this message did, it
[1:10:57] killed off all of your all of your
[1:11:00] systematic Amen. identification, all of
[1:11:02] your systematic Christianity. It married
[1:11:05] you to Jesus Christ. YOU'RE NOT A CHURCH
[1:11:07] ANYMORE. You're a bride. And what and
[1:11:09] and and listen, IT'S VERY SPECIAL TO be
[1:11:11] the bride of Christ in this day because
[1:11:13] a marriage comes with a name change.
[1:11:16] AMEN. YOU SEE, THERE HAS TO be a change
[1:11:18] of name to have a marriage. If you show
[1:11:20] up to my house with a box of
[1:11:21] rattlesnakes and say, "I got a box of
[1:11:23] rattlesnakes here for Cheyenne Hyatt and
[1:11:26] and she ordered them and and you know,
[1:11:28] she paid the price uh uh many years ago
[1:11:30] to to get these rattlesnakes and now I'm
[1:11:32] showing up. I'm going to give it to
[1:11:34] her." I'll tell you what we my wife
[1:11:35] would say. Cheyenne Hyatt don't live
[1:11:37] here. THERE IS NO MRS. HYATT IN THIS
[1:11:40] HOUSE. AMEN. NO, THIS IS MRS. ERICSON'S
[1:11:42] HOUSE. AND FRIENDS, THAT'S WHERE THAT'S
[1:11:45] WHERE WE THINK THAT WE GOT TO ACCEPT
[1:11:46] SOMETHING FROM THE DEVIL. AMEN. UNDER
[1:11:48] THE IDENTIFICATION OF WHO WE ARE AS
[1:11:51] HUMAN BEINGS. BUT YOU DON'T CUZ IT'S NOT
[1:11:54] WHO YOU ARE. YOU'VE HAD A NAME CHANGE.
[1:11:56] YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO
[1:11:59] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU DON'T
[1:12:00] HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR WHAT THE DEVIL'S
[1:12:02] TRYING to deliver. You do not have to
[1:12:04] accept it. Yeah, we could talk about my
[1:12:06] faults. We could take out I could preach
[1:12:08] a 40-part series on mistakes that I have
[1:12:10] made. But listen, that Nathan Ericson
[1:12:13] died many years ago. I AM CRUCIFIED IN
[1:12:16] CHRIST. NEVERTHELESS, I LIVE. [laughter]
[1:12:19] AMEN. NOT I, BUT CHRIST LIVETH IN ME.
[1:12:22] And the life which I now live in the
[1:12:23] flesh, I live by the faith of the son of
[1:12:27] God who loved me and he gave himself for
[1:12:30] me. He became sin. Amen. But that's only
[1:12:35] half of it. I
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S WHAT
[1:12:37] GREAT IS THE MYSTERY of godliness.
[1:12:39] People have wrote papers. Amen. People
[1:12:41] have uh built their thesis. People have
[1:12:43] argued for 2,000 years about every
[1:12:46] little nuance of of of the uh of the
[1:12:48] condescension of Jesus Christ, of God
[1:12:50] becoming flesh. And it MYSTIFIES PEOPLE.
[1:12:53] AMEN. THE IDEA OF HE COULD BECOME SIN.
[1:12:56] WHAT A GREAT MYSTERY THAT IS. BUT THAT'S
[1:12:59] ONLY HALF THE MYSTERY. I WANT TO TELL
[1:13:01] YOU FRIENDS, NOT ONLY DID HE BECOME MY
[1:13:03] SIN, BUT I BECAME HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:13:06] AMEN. I'M UNDER A DIFFERENT
[1:13:07] IDENTIFICATION. AMEN. I'M AS RIGHTEOUS
[1:13:10] AS HE IS RIGHTEOUS.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; PURE AS HE IS PURE. I'm him because I'm
[1:13:15] his bride.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. My faith, my reception of the word
[1:13:19] of God today vindicates to me who I am.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. To the world, you
[1:13:24] might be a sinner. I think young people,
[1:13:26] this is a refrigerator quote. But to
[1:13:28] God, you're not because you're in
[1:13:30] Christ. How can you be a sinner when
[1:13:32] you're in the sinless one? And God only
[1:13:34] sees him who you are in. Friends,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; yes, sir. I want you to see your
[1:13:39] position today. Amen. The theme of the
[1:13:41] meeting has been has been recognizing
[1:13:43] who you are. Recognizing your position,
[1:13:46] recognizing. [laughter] And look,
[1:13:47] friends, I I just want to I I want to
[1:13:49] put my little piece in today to let you
[1:13:51] know you're not just saved. You're safe.
[1:13:54] Amen. There's a lot of people that ARE
[1:13:55] SAVED, THEY JUST DON'T know that they're
[1:13:57] safe. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SECURE YOU
[1:13:59] are as the bride OF JESUS CHRIST. I WANT
[1:14:01] FEAR TO DIE TODAY. AMEN. I WANT I WANT
[1:14:04] CONDEMNATION TO PASS OFF OF SOME LIVES.
[1:14:06] AMEN. I I I WANT THE BRIDE TO BE ABLE TO
[1:14:08] REJOICE IN WHO SHE IS AND WHERE SHE
[1:14:10] STANDS. THAT'S WHERE my heart is.
[1:14:13] Friends, you got to see your position
[1:14:14] now. Amen. In this story, Amen. That
[1:14:17] little woman is sitting there on top of
[1:14:18] a tower. Amen. Besieged. Yeah. See, she
[1:14:22] her life wasn't at peace. SHE WAS IN A
[1:14:24] BATTLE. AMEN. There was an enemy that
[1:14:26] was besieging her. Had had had had had
[1:14:28] encircled her. And on every hand is an
[1:14:31] enemy that's throwing his fiery darts
[1:14:33] and and trying to burn her down. Amen.
[1:14:36] trying to hurl his stones and trying to
[1:14:38] trying TO TRYING TO BREACH THE tower of
[1:14:40] safety that she's in. Amen. So, it's not
[1:14:43] a time OF PEACE. A AND FRIENDS, you
[1:14:45] know, uh there'll be peace in the
[1:14:46] millennium, but there won't be any peace
[1:14:48] till we get out of here. Amen. I know
[1:14:50] you're in a battle. I know I'm in a
[1:14:51] battle. Amen. BUT WHEN YOU REALIZE YOUR
[1:14:53] POSITION in the battle, AMEN. THAT
[1:14:55] YOU'RE NOT OUT HERE IN A FIELD SOMEWHERE
[1:14:58] LEFT TO JUST FEND FOR YOURSELF. AMEN.
[1:15:00] AND TRUST IN YOUR OWN SELF-DEFENSE. BUT
[1:15:02] YOU'RE IN A TOWER. THERE'S A STRONG
[1:15:05] PLACE. HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "BROTHER
[1:15:07] NATHAN, what am I in the bride age or in
[1:15:09] I AM I IN LEADYA?" DEPENDS ON YOUR
[1:15:11] IDENTIFICATION CUZ THIS KING ALREADY
[1:15:13] CAME AND BURNED DOWN THE WHOLE TOWN. BUT
[1:15:16] WITHIN THAT TOWN, THERE WAS A TOWER.
[1:15:19] HALLELUJAH. I'M NOT A LAY OUT OF SIN.
[1:15:21] AMEN. I'M NOT WRETCHED. I'M NOT
[1:15:23] MISERABLE. I'M NOT BLIND. I'M NOT NAKED.
[1:15:26] I'M NOT UNPROTECTED.
[1:15:28] I AM UNDER A DIFFERENT IDENTIFICATION.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; YEAH. I'm under siege, but I'm operating
[1:15:35] today from a position of peace and
[1:15:39] security. I'm in a good place.
[1:15:42] I don't know what you're going through
[1:15:43] today. You might be in the middle of You
[1:15:45] might have come to these meetings in the
[1:15:47] middle of the greatest storm of your
[1:15:48] life, but I want you to know by the word
[1:15:50] of God today, you're in a good place.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Just turn your neighbor down. Say, "I'm
[1:15:54] in a good place." Amen. I'm in A GOOD
[1:15:56] PLACE. I'M SAFE WHERE I'm at. Amen. I'm
[1:15:59] covered where I'm at. I don't have to
[1:16:01] worry where I'm at. I'm in a good place.
[1:16:03] We are troubled on every side, yet not
[1:16:06] distressed. We are perplexed, but we're
[1:16:08] not in despair. We're persecuted, but
[1:16:10] we're not forsaken. We're cast down, BUT
[1:16:13] WE'RE NOT DESTROYED cuz we're bearing
[1:16:15] about in our body the dying of the Lord
[1:16:17] Jesus.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's something about a
[1:16:21] siege. You know, siege sieges go on a
[1:16:24] long time. They don't usually end in a
[1:16:26] pitch battle. It's usually a long
[1:16:28] process. And there's a lot of
[1:16:30] psychological warfare happens in a
[1:16:32] siege. And that's what that's why the
[1:16:34] greatest battle ever fought. Amen. Is
[1:16:36] not out here, but it's up here. Amen.
[1:16:39] Because you've got an enemy at your
[1:16:40] gates. And he has surrounded your tower
[1:16:42] of identification today. And he wants to
[1:16:45] do anything he can to get you to take
[1:16:47] one step out from that fortress. Just
[1:16:50] one step just TO GET YOU TO DOUBT THE
[1:16:52] WORD OF GOD AND GET OUT from behind your
[1:16:54] place of protection. Amen. And so he's
[1:16:56] always trying to convince you that
[1:16:58] you're not as safe as you think you are.
[1:17:00] HE'S ALWAYS JUST TRYING TO PUT A LITTLE
[1:17:01] SEED IN YOUR MIND AND MAKE YOU JUST
[1:17:03] DOUBT. HEY MAN, THINK WHAT? You're going
[1:17:04] to run out of thing. You know, you're
[1:17:06] going to run out eventually. YOU'VE HELD
[1:17:08] ME OFF THIS FAR, but I'm going to keep
[1:17:10] throwing my darts. One of these days
[1:17:11] you're going to crack. One of these days
[1:17:13] you're going to make the last mistake.
[1:17:15] And one of these days I'm going to get
[1:17:16] you in a snare for THE FINAL TIME. GOD'S
[1:17:18] GOING TO THROW YOU OUT. THEN YOU'LL BE
[1:17:19] MINE. THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL COMES. I'LL
[1:17:22] TELL YOU WHAT. BUT AS WE HEARD THIS
[1:17:24] WEEKEND, AMEN. THE ONLY REASON HE'S
[1:17:26] TALKING so much, AMEN, IS CUZ HE CAN'T
[1:17:28] TOUCH YOU. ALL HE CAN DO IS TALK AT YOU.
[1:17:30] AMEN. BUT HE CAN'T GET THROUGH THAT
[1:17:32] DOOR, CUZ THE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS LAID
[1:17:35] DOWN. AMEN. IN THIS DAY, AMEN. to be our
[1:17:38] protection against the enemy.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; He's trying to demoralize you, friends.
[1:17:43] I'll tell you what. But you know what?
[1:17:44] You think, "Oh, it's so rough to be
[1:17:46] besieged. you know, oh, the enemy is all
[1:17:49] around me and I can't go do the things I
[1:17:50] want to do and I can't just, you know,
[1:17:52] go enjoy the things I want to enjoy and
[1:17:54] I can't go here and eat there and I
[1:17:56] can't oh, I can't wear this and wear Oh,
[1:17:58] it's terrible to be besieged. Amen. But
[1:18:01] it ain't a picnic to be the besieger
[1:18:03] either. Cuz what the enemy does, he
[1:18:05] comes and he gets around your tower. Oh,
[1:18:07] yeah. And he runs through all your crops
[1:18:08] and eats all your food and and kills all
[1:18:10] your animals and and raids all your
[1:18:13] treasure and Amen. and he just runs
[1:18:14] rampant all through the city and takes
[1:18:16] everything that you have. Amen. But
[1:18:18] after a while, he runs out. And after a
[1:18:20] while, you know, he he starts throwing
[1:18:22] rocks and and and and and spears and
[1:18:25] darts at your tower. BUT AFTER A WHILE,
[1:18:26] HE STARTS RUNNING out of arrows. Amen.
[1:18:29] AND YOU KNOW, AFTER A WHILE, HUNGER
[1:18:31] BEGINS TO SET IN TO THE SIEGE CAMP.
[1:18:33] THAT'S WHEN THINGS GET DESPERATE. AMEN.
[1:18:35] THAT'S WHEN HE REALLY STARTS TALKING.
[1:18:37] THAT'S WHEN HE REALLY STARTS PLAYING
[1:18:38] MIND GAMES. AMEN. WHEN HE'S JUST AT THE
[1:18:41] POINT OF LOSING THE BATTLE. WHEN HE'S
[1:18:43] TRIED EVERYTHING HE COULD TRY AND YOU'RE
[1:18:45] STILL STANDING. AMEN. WHEN HE'S BROUGHT
[1:18:47] YOU AMEN. WHEN HE'S JUST THROWN
[1:18:49] EVERYTHING HE HAD AT YOU AND IT JUST
[1:18:51] BOUNCED OFF AND HE COULDN'T PIERCE
[1:18:53] THROUGH YOUR VEIL OF IDENTIFICATION.
[1:18:55] That's when the devil gets desperate,
[1:18:57] friends.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know what? I'll tell
[1:18:59] you what. Amen. That you say, is it
[1:19:01] better to be the besieger or the
[1:19:02] besieged? Depends on the resources.
[1:19:05] Depends on who's going to run out of
[1:19:06] food first. Depends on who's going to
[1:19:08] run out of water first. Hallelujah,
[1:19:11] friends. But in THIS FORTRESS, WE'VE GOT
[1:19:13] AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY. AMEN. LISTEN,
[1:19:16] THERE IS NO FEAR OF THE MESSAGE RUNNING
[1:19:18] OUT OF REVIVAL. AMEN. HERE AT TRUEWARD
[1:19:20] TABERNACLE, WE DON'T HAVE TO GET WORRIED
[1:19:22] THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO COOL OFF AND
[1:19:24] WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF POWER. AMEN.
[1:19:26] OH MY. PEOPLE ARE COMING AND THINGS ARE
[1:19:28] CHANGING AND THINGS WON'T BE THE SAME.
[1:19:30] CHRIST WILL BE THE SAME. ON CHRIST, THE
[1:19:32] SOLID ROCK WE STAND. NO MATTER WHAT
[1:19:35] TODAY BRINGS OR TOMORROW BRINGS, WE HAVE
[1:19:38] A FOUNTAIN THAT'LL NEVER RUN DRY. IF
[1:19:40] YOU'RE A LITTLE COLD THIS WEEKEND, AMEN.
[1:19:43] THE A FOUNTAIN HAS SPRUNG UP IN THESE
[1:19:45] MEETINGS. UH ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GO GET
[1:19:47] ANOTHER DRINK. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DRINK
[1:19:49] IT DRY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT. THE
[1:19:51] BREAD OF LIFE IS SERVED day after day
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; in an inexhaustible supply.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; See, we're in a battle, but we're not on
[1:19:59] rations. And if there's one thing I
[1:20:01] hate, if there's one thing I hate is
[1:20:04] WHEN THERE'S A WHOLE TABLE FULL OF GOOD
[1:20:05] food to eat and somebody say, "Well,
[1:20:07] don't eat all of it. We'll save some for
[1:20:09] tomorrow." But I'm HUNGRY NOW. AMEN. AND
[1:20:12] I GOT AN APPETITE NOW. I'M NOT WAITING
[1:20:14] FOR THE MILLENNIUM TO HAVE SOME PEACE.
[1:20:16] I'M NOT WAITING FOR THE MILLENNIUM TO
[1:20:18] HAVE SOME JOY. AMEN. I THINK I'LL GO
[1:20:20] AHEAD AND BE HAPPY NOW. I'LL BE IN
[1:20:21] REVIVAL NOW. I'LL BE ON FIRE NOW. AMEN.
[1:20:24] AND IF MY FLAME BURNS A LITTLE LOW,
[1:20:26] THERE'S ENOUGH OIL IN A STOCKPILE. I
[1:20:28] AIN'T FIXING TO RUN OUT.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. We're not on rations. You're
[1:20:35] not going to run out of revival. Just go
[1:20:36] back to the well. Listen,
[1:20:40] I want you to see, brother, brother,
[1:20:43] what this message done and and uh it's
[1:20:46] been preached. So be the the wonderful
[1:20:47] thing is I don't have to take an hour to
[1:20:49] try to teach it. It's been preached all
[1:20:50] weekend. But but spoken word is the
[1:20:53] original seed. Brother Anna will tell
[1:20:55] you, amen, that your spiritual womb has
[1:20:57] been sealed against denominational seed.
[1:21:00] In other words, you're already at a
[1:21:01] place where the word has come into your
[1:21:04] into your heart of faith and it's been
[1:21:06] sealed off and it's sealed against
[1:21:08] anything the devil would try to put in
[1:21:09] there. That's how secure you are. I'm
[1:21:12] trying to tell you, you're in a fortress
[1:21:13] that is impregnable. You know what that
[1:21:15] word means? It means it cannot be Amen.
[1:21:17] It cannot it cannot crumble. Amen. It
[1:21:20] cannot be accessed by the enemy. AMEN.
[1:21:22] THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE ENEMY can get in
[1:21:24] there AND DRAG YOU OUT. IT IS AN
[1:21:26] IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS. THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:21:28] CHRIST. AMEN. IS NOT IS NOT RESTING ON A
[1:21:31] HOPE SO. SHE'S NOT RESTING ON A MIGHT BE
[1:21:33] ABLE TO DO IT. AMEN. SHE'S RESTING,
[1:21:35] AMEN. ON THE ETERNAL WORD OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:21:38] WHICH WORD SHE IS. AMEN. LOOK, BROTHER
[1:21:41] WOULD SAY, HE WOULD SPEAK. HE WOULD
[1:21:42] TEACH ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT THE SEALING
[1:21:44] OF THE WOMB AND how you're an
[1:21:45] impregnable bride and amen. AND AND HOW
[1:21:48] GOD HAS PUT HIS SEED word in you. And
[1:21:51] then he'll just come to this and he'll
[1:21:52] say, look, he said, when you really
[1:21:54] realize that God has revealed to you the
[1:21:55] truth of the thing, there is nothing in
[1:21:57] the world going to defeat you in it.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's all. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
[1:22:02] UNDEFEABLE.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; NOT YOU, BUT GOD THAT IS IN YOU. DO YOU
[1:22:07] BELIEVE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LET'S LET'S MAKE IT OUR
[1:22:10] CONFESSION TODAY. I AM ABSOLUTELY
[1:22:12] UNDEFEABLE.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME. IT'S CHRIST THAT'S IN ME.
[1:22:16] AMEN. I CANNOT LOSE. I CANNOT AMEN. I
[1:22:19] CANNOT PERISH. I CANNOT FAIL. AMEN. THIS
[1:22:22] CHILD WILL BE BROUGHT FORTH.
[1:22:26] [applause]
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; How am I GOING TO DO IT? HOW AM I GOING
[1:22:28] TO DO IT? DON'T WORRY, MARY. THE HOLY
[1:22:30] Ghost is going to OVERSHADOW YOU.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN A RAPTURE. The
[1:22:33] Holy Ghost, AMEN, IS GOING TO PUT you in
[1:22:35] a rapture. AMEN. BECAUSE THE THE VERY
[1:22:38] coming of the Lord, how many know, is
[1:22:39] the coming of the promised son. That's
[1:22:41] the type.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I just I'm a little
[1:22:44] all over the place. But I remember one
[1:22:46] time I remember one time uh we were
[1:22:49] expecting uh Rowan, our first our first
[1:22:52] baby. And I we had a little moment, you
[1:22:54] know, that new parents do or prospective
[1:22:56] parents. Cheyenne was so sick. And it
[1:22:59] was just a rough day. And there she is
[1:23:02] just kind of curled up around the
[1:23:03] toilet. And I'm sitting on the floor
[1:23:05] with my arms around her, you know,
[1:23:07] trying to trying to relate, but I
[1:23:08] couldn't. [laughter]
[1:23:10] And she said, "OH, I JUST WISH I DIDN'T
[1:23:13] HAVE TO HAVE THIS BABY."
[1:23:15] I said, "Well, here's the [laughter]
[1:23:17] thing.
[1:23:18] It's too late.
[1:23:20] It's too late, church." Amen. And that's
[1:23:23] the message of the devil today. It's too
[1:23:25] late. Amen. To stop a rapture, it's too
[1:23:27] late. Amen. To stop the bride of Jesus
[1:23:30] Christ. A word seed has already been
[1:23:32] planted. A womb has been sealed. The pro
[1:23:34] Amen. The process of life is in motion.
[1:23:36] Amen. SHE'S GOING TO BRING FORTH THE
[1:23:38] COMING OF THE LORD. YOU CAN'T STOP IT.
[1:23:40] YOU MIGHT WISH IT. AMEN. SHE MIGHT HAVE
[1:23:42] SICK DAYS. SHE MIGHT HAVE BAD DAYS. SHE
[1:23:44] MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLES. AMEN. BUT THE SON
[1:23:46] OF GOD IS COMING FORTH FROM HER
[1:23:48] SPIRITUAL WOMB. AMEN. FRIENDS, WE CAN'T
[1:23:51] LOSE. WE CANNOT BE DEFEATED.
[1:23:54] THE LAW OF LIFE IS IN EFFECT. WE'RE AN
[1:23:56] IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS. AND THE ONLY
[1:23:58] BATTLE THAT WE'RE FIGHTING NOW, BROTHER
[1:23:59] RAM SAID, IS A SHOWDOWN. AND WHAT'S
[1:24:02] HAPPENING IS GOD IS PROVING TO THE DEVIL
[1:24:04] THAT THIS BRIDE IS NOT LIKE EVE. YOU
[1:24:07] MIGHT NOT KNOW IT, BUT YOU'RE NOT.
[1:24:10] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO UNBELIE DISBELIEVE
[1:24:11] THE WORD. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE
[1:24:13] FORTRESS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE
[1:24:15] MESSAGE. DON'T BELIEVE THAT DEVIL.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A BELIEVER.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; She's not like Eve cuz she's not that
[1:24:24] kind of a woman.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, THE name of the Lord is
[1:24:28] a strong tower. That's why we don't have
[1:24:30] to be afraid of missing the rapture
[1:24:31] today.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Look, friends. Amen. If you if you if
[1:24:35] you're afraid of missing the rapture,
[1:24:36] you start listening to the message a
[1:24:38] little more.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you listen to the very the
[1:24:40] very scripture brother Brandon used to
[1:24:41] preach the rapture
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; in the time of trouble.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL HIDE ME IN HIS PAVILION and in
[1:24:49] THE SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE
[1:24:51] HIDE ME. HE SHALL SET ME UPON A ROCK.
[1:24:55] I'M IN A TOWER TODAY. HALLELUJAH. HOW
[1:24:57] COULD I MISS THE RAPTURE WHEN THIS TOWER
[1:24:59] IS A ROCKET SHIP? AMEN. IS BOUND FOR
[1:25:02] GLORY. AND IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR TAKEOFF,
[1:25:04] CHURCH. AMEN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. JUST
[1:25:06] GET IN IT. HALLELUJAH. GET IN IT,
[1:25:09] BROTHER RONNIE. JUST GET IN IT. JUST
[1:25:10] BELIEVE IT. JUST JUST EAT IT UP.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR IDENTIFICATION. We got a token.
[1:25:17] Brother Brim said in the token, he said,
[1:25:19] "All those who are identified in Christ
[1:25:21] by the token, God is going to take them
[1:25:23] with him when he comes." Hallelujah. How
[1:25:26] do I know I'm taking a rapture? Cuz I'm
[1:25:27] identified. I've got a token on display.
[1:25:30] Amen. It says, "I bel I I I am the
[1:25:32] rapture.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I am the message.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I am the coming of the Lord
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; by putting me in Christ."
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Now, we come I've spent the first half
[1:25:42] of my sermon to try to show your
[1:25:44] position. How many see it?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; By putting me in Christ, he already put
[1:25:49] me in the rapture.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; And now we've come to our judges story.
[1:25:54] How many can see that woman up in the
[1:25:55] tower?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; You're that little woman.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not, you maybe aren't much,
[1:26:00] but you got a you're on a tower.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been lifted up to a place,
[1:26:04] amen, of protection. And you're that
[1:26:06] little woman in the tower, and we can
[1:26:08] see our position. We could preach all
[1:26:10] day long how that little woman, she
[1:26:12] wasn't hid somewhere on the first story
[1:26:14] or the second story or the seventh
[1:26:16] story. Here she is in plain view. Amen.
[1:26:18] She had to come all the way to the top
[1:26:20] of a tower where there's a stone. Amen.
[1:26:23] A capstone, a millstone. SHE'S ON TOP OF
[1:26:26] A TOWER. SEE, THE MILLSTONE'S BEEN
[1:26:27] BROKEN. AMEN. THE HARVEST has already
[1:26:30] come. Amen. The the the the the the
[1:26:32] fields have been ALREADY BEEN RIPE.
[1:26:33] THAT'S WHY THE ENEMY'S COMING. THAT'S
[1:26:35] WHAT HE'S AFTER IS THE FOOD THAT she's
[1:26:37] got. AMEN. BUT SHE'S GOT A MILLSTONE.
[1:26:39] IT'S NOT NEEDED FOR WHAT IT USED TO BE
[1:26:41] NEEDED FOR. NOW THERE'S ONE MORE THING
[1:26:43] TO DO WITH THAT STONE. AMEN. AND THAT'S
[1:26:45] KILL A KING. HALLELUJAH, FRIENDS. AMEN.
[1:26:48] SHE'S ON A TOWER. OH, GLORY. AND IT'S
[1:26:51] TIME TO KILL A KING.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, WHAT KING ARE YOU TALKING
[1:26:54] ABOUT, BROTHER NATHAN? THE BOOK OF JOB.
[1:26:56] CALL HIM THE KING OF TERRORS. AMEN. THE
[1:27:01] GREAT KING DEATH, THE KING OF ALL
[1:27:03] TERRORS, THE KING OF ALL FEARS. THIS
[1:27:06] GREAT KING. AMEN. He's the He's the He's
[1:27:09] the fear of everyone, rich or poor, of
[1:27:12] everyone, GREAT OR SMALL. IT NO MATTER
[1:27:13] WHO YOU ARE, DEATH COMES FOR US ALL.
[1:27:16] IT'S THE GREAT EQUALIZER. AMEN. Even
[1:27:18] kings and emperors and great men FEAR
[1:27:21] THIS KING OF ALL TERRORS. AMEN. Every
[1:27:23] fear is beneath him. He's a prince among
[1:27:25] devils. He is a king. He's a murderer.
[1:27:28] HE'S A SLAYER OF THE BRETHREN. AMEN.
[1:27:30] HE'S A KILLER OF THE JUDGES SONS. AMEN.
[1:27:34] THAT'S WHO THIS KING IS. AMEN. BUT NOW
[1:27:36] WE FIND OUT WHERE WE'RE AT, WHERE WE
[1:27:38] HAVE COME TO. AMEN. WE'RE IN A TOWER AND
[1:27:41] THE KING IS DOWN THERE. AND IT'S TIME,
[1:27:43] LITTLE BRIDE, TO KILL A KING. IT'S TIME
[1:27:45] TO TAKE A STONE OF REVELATION IN YOUR
[1:27:48] HANDS AND STRIKE THE ENEMY WITH IT. IT'S
[1:27:50] TIME TO STRIKE THE FINAL BLOW.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; That great carrying bird. He been
[1:27:57] circling over humanity ever since Eve
[1:27:59] fell. Feasting on all of our rot and all
[1:28:01] of our corruption. Amen. And everywhere
[1:28:03] power collects, corruption comes in.
[1:28:06] Next thing you know, our boys are going
[1:28:08] out to die in wars. And our little girls
[1:28:10] are Amen. are are falling subject to the
[1:28:12] whim of the enemy. Amen. He's a He's a
[1:28:14] killer. He's a terrible king. Don't feel
[1:28:16] bad for him. He's a villain. He ain't a
[1:28:19] good guy. [laughter] Amen. But I tell
[1:28:21] you what, it's time for him to die,
[1:28:22] isn't it?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; See, but see, he's a great king of
[1:28:26] terrors. But Jesus already defeated him.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus defeated death. Hebrews says
[1:28:34] through death, Christ would destroy him
[1:28:36] that had the power of death, that is the
[1:28:38] devil.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And deliver them who through, listen,
[1:28:42] through fear of death, they were all
[1:28:44] their lifetimes subject to bondage.
[1:28:47] That's what it means to be a fallen
[1:28:49] human being is all your life you're
[1:28:51] under the bondage of no matter how good
[1:28:53] my life is here, death will come for me
[1:28:55] in the end. It's bondage. It's not
[1:28:58] freedom. It's not life. It's bondage.
[1:29:00] Amen. But Christ came to die that
[1:29:03] through his own death, he could put to
[1:29:05] death death itself. Amen. Oh my. And set
[1:29:09] everybody at liberty from the fear of
[1:29:10] death. Brother Brham would say he
[1:29:13] conquered death and hell. He conquered
[1:29:15] what the others couldn't conquer because
[1:29:17] they're of a natural seed. See, you're
[1:29:19] of a natural in your natural seed, you
[1:29:21] can't conquer, but he already conquered.
[1:29:24] This is a spiritual seed. He conquered
[1:29:26] the gate of the grave and rose up on the
[1:29:29] third day for our justification. And now
[1:29:31] we are more than conquerors. Now,
[1:29:35] Brother Brham WOULD SAY WE ARE DEALING
[1:29:37] with a defeated enemy.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that might be news to you. The
[1:29:43] enemy that you're dealing with is a
[1:29:45] defeated enemy.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; It's a powerless enemy. Amen. It's a
[1:29:49] It's a defeated enemy. Sickness is
[1:29:51] defeated. Brother Bam said, "Death is
[1:29:53] defeated. Hell is defeated. Everything
[1:29:56] is defeated. And we are disputing with a
[1:29:58] conquered enemy." No wonder Paul could
[1:30:00] say when they were even when they were
[1:30:02] building a block to chop his head off,
[1:30:04] Paul would say, "Oh, death, where is
[1:30:06] your sting?" And I want to see I want
[1:30:09] you to see the gravity of this moment of
[1:30:11] being the rapture church of living in
[1:30:14] the day of rapturing faith and rapturing
[1:30:16] grace. What it means IS BECAUSE PAUL
[1:30:19] WOULD PREACH US THE SERMON OF the
[1:30:21] resurrection and say, "Oh grave, where
[1:30:23] is your sting? Oh death, where your
[1:30:24] sting, grave, where's your victory?" And
[1:30:26] he would he would rail against that
[1:30:28] defeated enemy. Amen. But the axe still
[1:30:30] came for his head. Amen. Peter was there
[1:30:33] when Jesus rose from THE GRAVE AND HE
[1:30:35] TESTIFIED HIS WHOLE LIFE of the
[1:30:36] resurrection of Christ. But there WAS A
[1:30:38] CROSS WAITING. AMEN. WHERE HE WOULD HANG
[1:30:40] THERE UPSIDE DOWN AND CHOKE TO DEATH.
[1:30:42] AMEN. UH TRUSTING IN THE PROMISE OF A
[1:30:45] RESURRECTION. AMEN. SEE, THERE'S A FINAL
[1:30:47] BLOW THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE STRUCK.
[1:30:50] AMEN. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOT TO
[1:30:51] HAPPEN, FRIENDS. AMEN. DEATH IS ALREADY
[1:30:53] DEFEATED, BUT THERE IS A TIME OF
[1:30:55] MANIFESTATION. THERE IS A TIME TO STRIKE
[1:30:58] THE FINAL BLOW.
[1:31:00] DEATH TOOK OUR APOSTLES. DEATH TOOK OUR
[1:31:02] MESSENGERS. DEATH TOOK OUR PROPHET. BUT
[1:31:05] THERE'S GOING TO BE A GENERATION THAT
[1:31:07] WILL NOT TASTE DEATH. [applause]
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; That old wasp. Amen. He can grab you,
[1:31:16] but he can't sting you. Amen. CUZ HIS
[1:31:18] STINGER WAS PULLED OUT ON THE CROSS. HE
[1:31:20] STUCK IT SO DEEP INTO CHRIST. AMEN. THAT
[1:31:23] IT WAS RIPPED OUT WHEN HE RELEASED HIM.
[1:31:25] AMEN. DEATH CAN TAKE YOU IN HIS CLUTCHES
[1:31:27] AND TAKE YOU, AMEN. AND ALL IT CAN DO IS
[1:31:29] ROCK YOU TO SLEEP. IT HAS NO POWER over
[1:31:31] you, friends. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. AMEN.
[1:31:34] BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OLD SAINTS SLEEPING
[1:31:36] IN THE GRAVE. What are they waiting for?
[1:31:38] WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR? WHAT ARE THEY
[1:31:41] RESTING ON? AMEN. WHAT HOW LONG ARE THEY
[1:31:43] GOING TO SLEEP, FRIENDS?
[1:31:46] Just above our text in First
[1:31:47] Corinthians, the Bible says that he must
[1:31:50] reign until he has put all enemies under
[1:31:52] his feet.
[1:31:54] And the last enemy
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; that shall be destroyed is death.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; It's the final blow.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; It's the final victory.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Oh, it's Do you see it,
[1:32:05] CHURCH? THE LAST ENEMY THAT SHALL BE
[1:32:08] DESTROYED IS DEATH. THAT'S why we read
[1:32:09] in the scripture there, we see exactly
[1:32:11] what the rapture of the church is. When
[1:32:13] this corruptible puts on incorruption,
[1:32:16] when this mortal puts on immortality,
[1:32:19] then [laughter]
[1:32:21] can I SAY NOW?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DAY LIKE THIS DAY.
[1:32:26] NOW, IN THIS AT THIS HOUR, AT THIS TIME,
[1:32:30] IS BROUGHT TO PASS THE SAYING, DEATH IS
[1:32:33] SWALLOWED UP IN VICTORY. OH, DEATH,
[1:32:36] WHERE IS YOUR STING? OH, CRAVE, WHERE IS
[1:32:39] YOUR VICTORY? THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE
[1:32:41] FINAL BLOW.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I pray I PRAY THIS HUMBLE SERMON WOULD
[1:32:47] CHANGE SOMEBODY'S VIEW ON THE rapture
[1:32:48] forever. Amen. Cuz you see, we view the
[1:32:51] RAPTURE AND WE JUST THINK ABOUT IT as
[1:32:52] our escape. WE THINK ABOUT IT GETTING
[1:32:54] SNATCHED AWAY FROM TROUBLE. And it is
[1:32:56] that. Amen. But it's more than that,
[1:32:58] church. Amen. I know. I love that the
[1:33:00] Lord's coming. I love to think that the
[1:33:01] Lord will come between 6:00 and 9 in the
[1:33:03] morning cuz 9:00 is when I usually start
[1:33:05] work. I say, Lord, even so, Jesus,
[1:33:08] Monday morning, even so. Amen. I KNOW
[1:33:11] HOW WE THINK AS HUMAN BEINGS, BUT THE
[1:33:12] RAPTURE IS MORE THAN YOUR GETAWAY CAR.
[1:33:15] IT'S MORE THAN AN ESCAPE PLAN. IT'S A
[1:33:17] VICTORY. AMEN. IT'S A AMEN. IT'S A BLOW.
[1:33:20] IT'S A YOU'RE GOING TO AMEN. YOU ARE THE
[1:33:22] PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO STRIKE THE
[1:33:24] FINAL BLOW AND KILL THE KING OF TERRORS.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU ARE GOING TO PUT YOUR FEET ON
[1:33:33] THE NECK OF DEATH. THAT'S WHAT IT MEAN.
[1:33:35] OH MY. WHEN YOU STEP INTO THAT REALM,
[1:33:38] AMEN. YOU ARE YOU ARE PLACING AMEN YOUR
[1:33:41] FOOT ON THE NECK OF A KING OF DEVILS.
[1:33:44] AMEN. YOU ARE PUTTING HIM UNDER YOUR
[1:33:46] FEET. AMEN. YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE
[1:33:48] OVERRULING the law of death.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; That's what you're going to do.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. We think we're troubled. Amen.
[1:33:55] You got to understand the Exodus story,
[1:33:57] right? You think we think we're
[1:33:58] troubled. We think we're we're in
[1:34:00] bondage. We're the one slaved. You're
[1:34:02] the one causing the devil trouble. You
[1:34:04] see? Amen. Maybe earlier on in the
[1:34:07] church ages. Amen. And earlier on when
[1:34:09] the first plagues were fallen, Amen.
[1:34:10] Maybe there was a back and forth, but by
[1:34:12] the time it got to that last plague,
[1:34:14] Amen. by the time it came to the plague
[1:34:16] of death, Amen, [laughter]
[1:34:18] that Pharaoh was so sick of Goan, HE
[1:34:20] SAID, "I'VE DONE I'VE PUT SO MUCH WORK
[1:34:22] ON YOU. I'VE I'VE I'VE PILED UP SO MUCH
[1:34:24] ON YOUR BACK. I'VE WHIPPED YOU. I'VE
[1:34:26] FLOGGED YOU. I'VE OPPRESSED YOU." AMEN.
[1:34:28] BUT I JUST I'M JUST READY TO GET RID OF
[1:34:31] YOU. EVERYTHING I'VE TRIED, NOTHING HAS
[1:34:33] WORKED. HEY, I' I'VE TRIED, AMEN, TO GET
[1:34:36] YOU TO FORGET YOUR IDENTIFICATION. I
[1:34:38] TRIED TO TAKE YOUR FIRSTBORN SONS. AMEN.
[1:34:40] BUT YOU WON'T STOP. SO [screaming] GET
[1:34:42] OUT OF HERE. I'M TIRED OF YOU. WHAT A
[1:34:45] VICTORY, CHURCH. AMEN. IT'S TO THEM.
[1:34:48] AMEN. It's to them who are alive and
[1:34:51] remain.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; See, the se young people can quote it.
[1:34:55] The secret is don't quit.
[1:34:59] [panting and sighs]
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; See, brother would tell us in stature of
[1:35:01] a perfect man. He said these people who
[1:35:04] died are depending and waiting on us.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; So the church has got to come per to
[1:35:10] perfection in order to bring the
[1:35:12] resurrection.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Now how we already I already read the
[1:35:16] quote. How could you be perfect?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; You got to be in Christ.
[1:35:20] But when you get into that
[1:35:21] identification, that's what all these
[1:35:24] people who died have waited for is for
[1:35:26] the church to come into her position to
[1:35:28] strike that final blow. Of course, this
[1:35:30] is 62. Brother Bram still had him souls
[1:35:32] under the altar. But the principle is
[1:35:34] they're waiting for this church to come
[1:35:36] to its perfection when Christ comes.
[1:35:40] Brother, brother, sister, there's a
[1:35:42] cloud of witnesses. The Bible talks
[1:35:44] about you realize we're the final
[1:35:46] runners. I know it's been preached on
[1:35:48] and preached on and preached on. I just
[1:35:50] pray it become real today. That we're
[1:35:52] we're the final ones. Amen. And there's
[1:35:54] a cloud of witnesses like has never
[1:35:56] been. saints, amen, that went by way of
[1:35:58] the grave and there and sometimes
[1:36:00] watching over the banister cheering you
[1:36:02] on saying, "Don't you quit." Amen. Don't
[1:36:04] don't you give in. You just KEEP HOLDING
[1:36:07] ON. IN FACT, THERE'S no such THING OF
[1:36:09] HOLDING ON. YOU JUST TRUST THE LORD.
[1:36:10] HE'S THE ONE HOLDING on to you. Amen.
[1:36:13] Just keep running. JUST KEEP GOING. THIS
[1:36:15] AIN'T A SPEED RACE. THIS IS AN endurance
[1:36:17] race. IF YOU FALL DOWN, GET BACK UP.
[1:36:19] CAN'T YOU HEAR THE CLOUD SAYING, "JUST
[1:36:21] DON'T QUIT." AMEN. CUZ THERE'S A FINAL
[1:36:23] BLOW COMING. THERE'S A FINISH LINE JUST
[1:36:25] AROUND THE CORNER. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE
[1:36:28] THE ONES TO DO IT.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Run that final lamp.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE THE SIGN.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; BREAK THE CYCLE.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Wretched man that I am. Who shall
[1:36:42] deliver me?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; And now it's time for death to die.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; It's time for death to die. Now, here's
[1:36:52] my key quote. But if you don't pay
[1:36:53] attention to anything but this next five
[1:36:55] minutes,
[1:36:56] watch this quote with me. Brother Andrew
[1:36:59] brought this a couple weeks ago. It just
[1:37:00] fits perfect. The way of a true prophet,
[1:37:02] brother Brandham said, "Death is
[1:37:04] nothing."
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; We [clears throat] got it.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; it's ours.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; It can't control me.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; I control it.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; How? Through him who made me an
[1:37:16] overcomer. CUZ I'VE ALREADY OVERCOME
[1:37:18] DEATH. HOW DID I DO IT? I DON'T EVEN
[1:37:20] REMEMBER DOING IT. HOW DID I DO IT? BY
[1:37:22] BELIEVING ON HIM. AH, DEATH IS SIN AND
[1:37:25] UNBELIEF. I'M NOT AN UNBELIEVER. I'M A
[1:37:28] BELIEVER.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I'M RAISED FROM THAT THING. I'm
[1:37:32] resurrected. [applause] It's the earnest
[1:37:34] of my complete physical and spiritual
[1:37:36] resurrection.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Physical and spiritual. Amen. You see
[1:37:39] it. You get it. SO, WE DO HAVE DEATH
[1:37:42] UNDER OUR CONTROL through Christ Jesus
[1:37:46] who has overcome death, hell, grave,
[1:37:49] sickness, sorrow, and everything else.
[1:37:51] In case you had thought of something
[1:37:52] else to put in there, everything else
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; triumphed over all and we are now risen
[1:37:56] with him, setting in heavenly places.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; SPIRITUALLY SPEAKING, WE ARE IN CHRIST
[1:38:02] JESUS.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SAY, "NATURALLY, Brother
[1:38:05] Nathan, I'm depressed. Naturally, I've
[1:38:07] been under a cloud. Naturally, I'm
[1:38:09] struggling with some thing. Naturally,
[1:38:10] I'm sick in my body." SPIRITUALLY
[1:38:12] SPEAKING, YOU'RE IN CHRIST JESUS. AND
[1:38:14] BECAUSE YOU'RE IN CHRIST JESUS, YOU GOT
[1:38:16] ALL THINGS UNDER YOUR FEET. AMEN.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; OH, I'M WORRIED ABOUT MISSING THE
[1:38:21] RAPTURE. EVEN THE PHYSICAL RESURRECTION
[1:38:25] IS UNDER OUR FEET BECAUSE WE'RE IN
[1:38:28] CHRIST.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; SPIRITUALLY AND PHYSICALLY, WE ARE
[1:38:32] RESURRECTED ALREADY. [applause]
[1:38:35] I WANT TO PREACH WITH THE VOICE OF THE
[1:38:37] RESURRECTION TODAY AND LET THE DEVIL
[1:38:39] KNOW THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS THE TIME.
[1:38:42] IT IS TIME FOR DEATH TO DIE. [applause]
[1:38:47] HE'S ALREADY UNDER MY FEET.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, if physical
[1:38:54] death can't stop you, how could
[1:38:55] spiritual death?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "We're in the bride
[1:38:59] age." And the bride age is A
[1:39:00] RESURRECTION OUT OF DARK
[1:39:01] DENOMINATIONALISM.
[1:39:03] THAT'S WHY I'M NOT EXPECTING TRUER
[1:39:05] TABERNACLE TO DIE SPIRITUALLY. I'M NOT
[1:39:07] EXPECTING, AS LONG AS WE KEEP PREACHING
[1:39:09] THIS MESSAGE, I AIN'T EXPECTING
[1:39:11] SPIRITUAL DEATH. I'M NOT EXPECTING THE
[1:39:13] REVIVAL TO DIE. IT'S NOT BUILT ON A MAN.
[1:39:15] IT'S NOT BUILT ON A CHURCH. IT'S NOT
[1:39:17] BUILT ON A PEOPLE. IT'S RESTING ON OUR
[1:39:19] IDENTIFICATION FOR THIS HOUR.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; WE ARE spiritually resurrected.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; SPIRITUAL DEATH, BROTHER RAM said that's
[1:39:27] not See, that's not Satan's curse on
[1:39:29] you. Brother Ram said, spiritual death
[1:39:32] is God's final blow against the enemy.
[1:39:35] See, God has struck a blow. Amen. You
[1:39:38] say, "Brother Nathan, why'd I spend all
[1:39:40] that time in that dead church?" I'll
[1:39:41] tell you what, it was God's blow. Amen.
[1:39:44] to kill that church so dead that you
[1:39:46] would get so thirsty for life you would
[1:39:48] have to come out of it. Amen. It wasn't
[1:39:51] Satan's curse on you. Amen. It was God's
[1:39:53] curse on Satan. AMEN. TO DRY UP AND
[1:39:56] WITHER EVERY SYSTEM THAT WOULD OTHERWISE
[1:39:58] DECEIVE YOU SO THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT
[1:40:00] OF THAT IDENTIFICATION AND GET INTO
[1:40:02] CHRIST FOR THIS HOUR WHICH IS THE
[1:40:03] REVELATION OF THE MESSAGE PREACHED BY
[1:40:06] WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT'S A RESURRECTED LORD
[1:40:08] JESUS IN A WORD COMING IN THE FORMATION
[1:40:11] OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; WE ARE [screaming] ALIVE. WE'RE NOT
[1:40:15] DEAD.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE TO DIE SPIRITUALLY. I DON'T
[1:40:19] HAVE TO BE MISERABLE. I DON'T HAVE TO BE
[1:40:21] DEAD AND COLD AND FORMAL AND GIVE UP MY
[1:40:24] POWER. I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. NOT MY
[1:40:27] CURSE. NOT MY IDENTITY.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; NOT WHO I AM.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I'm resurrected.
[1:40:35] I'm already fired up.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what the token says. Says,
[1:40:41] uh-uh, not my curse. Blood is on the
[1:40:43] door.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; This ain't a quote quote message. This
[1:40:48] is a death killing message.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I tell you, when you you you run with
[1:40:52] this message, wherever you find some
[1:40:54] dead formal creed, anywhere you find a
[1:40:56] dead tradition of man, you kill it.
[1:40:59] That's what you're anointed to do.
[1:41:00] Brother said he was anointed to destroy
[1:41:02] the works of the devil and his body is
[1:41:04] the same. That's what we're ON EARTH TO
[1:41:06] DO. EVERY TIME, EVERY BRUSH UP WE HAVE
[1:41:08] WITH DEAD CHRISTIANITY, KILL THAT THING.
[1:41:11] YOU'RE A DEATH SLAYER. AMEN. YOU'RE A
[1:41:13] LIFEBRINGER. AMEN. YOU ARE THE CHANNEL
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; OF THE token life.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Death killers. [panting]
[1:41:22] Brother Brandham. Amen. remember he
[1:41:24] shared the story rejected king and he
[1:41:27] spoke a little about it and even the
[1:41:28] next week he was still talking about it
[1:41:30] how that the Lord let him go over there
[1:41:32] and see all of his converts and be in
[1:41:35] that place that presence and exper just
[1:41:37] get a taste of that life of that perfect
[1:41:40] love and and wrap his arms around those
[1:41:42] people amen oh and it affected him amen
[1:41:46] when he realized I've got a part over
[1:41:48] there I've got a legacy over there I got
[1:41:50] treasures there's people over there amen
[1:41:52] that belong Amen. That that are
[1:41:54] associated with me and my ministry. I
[1:41:57] got something waiting for me on the
[1:41:58] other side. Oh, Brother Pam would say,
[1:42:00] "I'll never forget what happened that
[1:42:02] last Sunday morning.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget it." He said, "It's
[1:42:05] done SOMETHING TO ME THAT'S
[1:42:06] revolutionized my life."
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I do not fear. I have not one fear of
[1:42:12] death.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; DEATH HAS NO FEAR at all. And brother B
[1:42:17] says, "And it doesn't for you if you
[1:42:18] just understood." Friends, if you just
[1:42:21] understood, if you could just see your
[1:42:24] identification, death would lose all its
[1:42:26] toll on you. Fear could NEVER TOUCH YOU.
[1:42:28] AMEN. YOU'D BE CHANGED FOREVER. AS
[1:42:30] BROTHER BRANDON WAS A CHANGED MAN, JUST
[1:42:32] FROM ONE TASTE OF THAT FUTURE HOME.
[1:42:35] AMEN. We would change it forever. I TELL

[1:43:12] WRAP AROUND THE SUBLIMENESS. AMEN. OF
[1:43:15] THAT LIFE OVER THERE. [laughter]
[1:43:17] HALLELUJAH. ALL RIGHT. IT WASN'T THE
[1:43:19] CHARLIE WE KNEW. IT WAS A DIFFERENT
[1:43:21] CHARLIE. AND EVER SINCE GOD SENT THAT
[1:43:23] DREAM, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S A
[1:43:24] DIFFERENT CHUCK COLLINS. AND IT'LL BE A
[1:43:27] DIFFERENT IT'LL BE DIFFERENT FOR YOU AND

[1:43:31] FUTURE HOME. I'VE GOT ANOTHER LIFE. I'VE
[1:43:34] GOT ANOTHER BODY WAITING FOR ME.

[1:43:38] LOSES ITS WHOLE. FEAR LOSES ITS GRIP.

[1:43:44] resurrection. It's so real. Amen. Sister
[1:43:46] Gail, you know, losing Sister Sarah
[1:43:48] maybe hasn't been mentioned in a while.
[1:43:50] And sometimes the devil comes say,
[1:43:51] "Well, everybody else is forgotten. THEY
[1:43:54] FORGOT MY GRIEF. THEY FORGOT MY BURDEN."
[1:43:56] AMEN. BUT IT'S NOT FORGOTTEN. AMEN. And
[1:43:58] there's nothing that can ever change.
[1:44:00] Amen. Amen. Her eternal status. Amen.
[1:44:03] THE THE SUFFERINGS THAT WE BEAR IN THIS
[1:44:05] PRESENT TIME AREN'T EVEN WORTHY TO BE

[1:44:32] lonely nights will be paid BACK WITH
[1:44:34] INTEREST. AMEN. ONE OF THESE DAYS, ONE

[1:45:23] AMEN. SOON AND VERY SOON. AND I'M SO
[1:45:26] GLAD TO HAVE A MESSAGE TO TELL ME THIS
[1:45:29] IS THE DAY OF RESURRECTION.
[1:45:32] [applause]
[1:45:37] I'm resting on it. I'm resting on it.
[1:45:39] I'm not working. I'm not worried.
[1:45:41] Resting on it. [panting]
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what the voice of
[1:45:46] resurrection has to tell to the enemy.
[1:45:50] Amen. This is a declaration against
[1:45:51] death. Amen. Because there is a death.
[1:45:55] Amen. That the devil has no power to put
[1:45:57] on you.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; There's worse things than dying,
[1:46:00] friends.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; There is a death waiting in the lake of
[1:46:04] fire. And this death now to an eternal
[1:46:07] being. How could there be any more
[1:46:09] horrible concept than this? Amen. That
[1:46:12] there is a place somewhere of total
[1:46:14] annihilation.
[1:46:16] Not you die and you go to another place,
[1:46:18] but you cease to exist and a being that
[1:46:21] was created no longer is. Amen. There is
[1:46:25] a death. It's the second death. It comes
[1:46:27] after the white throne judgment. Amen.
[1:46:29] But to know but to know this, friends,
[1:46:32] Jesus said those that have Amen. The
[1:46:34] Bible said those that have part in the
[1:46:35] first resurrection, Amen. They shall not
[1:46:38] taste the second death. Because hell is
[1:46:40] not created, Amen, for God's children.
[1:46:43] It was created for the devil and his
[1:46:45] angels. Amen. AND THAT'S WHY YOU GOT TO
[1:46:48] LET THE DEVIL KNOW, AMEN. CUZ LOOK,
[1:46:50] DEVIL, YOU COULD TAKE, AMEN. YOU MIGHT
[1:46:52] WAR AGAINST ME. YOU MIGHT TRY TO BRING
[1:46:54] SPIRITUAL DEATH ON ME. YOU COULD TAKE MY
[1:46:56] MY LOVED ONES BY WAY OF THE GRAVE. BUT
[1:46:58] THERE'S COMING A DAY, AMEN, WHEN DEATH
[1:47:01] WILL DIE A DEATH THAT WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
[1:47:04] AMEN. DEATH WILL CEASE TO BE. DEATH WILL
[1:47:06] BE ANNIHILATED. AND ALL OF HIS IMPS AND
[1:47:08] DEVILS WILL GO AND BURN WITH HIM. AND
[1:47:10] THEY WILL PERISH. AND LONG AFTER DEATH
[1:47:13] IS DEAD, WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE ALIVE.
[1:47:15] HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHO WE ARE, FRIENDS.
[1:47:18] TELL IT TO THE DEVIL. NOW IS THE HOUR TO
[1:47:20] PREACH IT. THIS IS RAPTURE TIME.
[1:47:23] EXERCISE YOUR RAPTURE FAITH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE DEVIL WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
[1:47:27] YOUR PAST, you just remind him of his
[1:47:29] future.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Blessed and holy is he that hath per the
[1:47:35] first resurrection. On such the second
[1:47:37] death hath no power.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; That's a reason to rejoice.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; That's a reason to be re to rejoice. Now
[1:47:46] this final blow, you see you see who you
[1:47:49] are. You see what's in your hand. You
[1:47:52] see you see the message. Now you see
[1:47:53] what you're supposed to do with it.
[1:47:55] Amen.

[1:48:03] important king with all his buddies

[1:48:25] to smash that tower down [panting]
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; and a little old washer woman,
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; a little old housewife, a little school
[1:48:34] teacher or something. See, he had
[1:48:35] already killed half the warriors. And
[1:48:37] all that was left, Amen, was mama had to
[1:48:40] get up there with a rock. Amen. And do a
[1:48:43] man-sized job. [laughter]
[1:48:47] And when she threw that rock down on
[1:48:48] that devil, I want you to see THE
[1:48:50] PICTURE. IT WAS SUCH a humiliation to
[1:48:53] that king. Amen. That he would HAVE
[1:48:55] RATHER HE WOULD RATHER FALL ON HIS OWN
[1:48:57] SWORD. AMEN. Than let THE TESTIMONY BE
[1:49:00] THAT A WOMAN PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.

[1:49:05] THESE DAYS AFTER A THOUSAND YEARS OF
[1:49:07] BEING BOUND BY CHAINS OF CIRCUMSTANCE,
[1:49:09] HE'LL SAY, "PLEASE THROW ME IN THAT LAKE
[1:49:10] OF FIRE. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I'M
[1:49:13] SICK OF THE HUMILIATION. I'M SICK OF
[1:49:15] THIS WOMAN. I'M SICK OF THIS BRIDE.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; JUST LET ME DIE.
[1:49:25] GLORY. [applause]
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says she was a certain
[1:49:33] woman. And I just love that that she was
[1:49:35] a CERTAIN WOMAN. NOW, SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE
[1:49:37] FELT CERTAIN. AMEN. SHE SHE MIGHT NOT
[1:49:39] HAVE FELT CERTAIN. You know, she she she
[1:49:42] I'm not certain if I can even lift this
[1:49:44] rock. I I'm not certain if I'll be able
[1:49:46] to keep my balance. I I don't even I'm
[1:49:49] not certain THAT I CAN HIT MY MARK. I'll
[1:49:51] tell you what, brother Jonathan was
[1:49:53] preaching on that third pole. Brother
[1:49:54] man, we came to that squirrel. He didn't
[1:49:55] even have to aim,
[1:49:57] friends.
[1:49:59] You could be certain ABOUT THIS MESSAGE
[1:50:01] CUZ THE POWER, THE EXCELLENCY OF THE
[1:50:03] POWER IS OF GOD AND NOT OF YOU.
[1:50:06] HALLELUJAH. JUST JUST THROW THE ROCK.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; LET GOD DO THE REST.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; OH MY. SEE, SHE WAS SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE
[1:50:12] BEEN CERTAIN. YOU MIGHT NOT BE CERTAIN.
[1:50:15] BUT THE WORD IS CERTAIN THAT THERE MUST
[1:50:17] BE A BRIDE AT THE LAST DAY TO STRIKE THE
[1:50:20] FINAL BLOW against the enemy.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; You had to be here. God needed somebody
[1:50:26] on top of the tower.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; You had to be there. [panting]
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And he knew you wouldn't be all that
[1:50:32] much. That's why he put you in a tower
[1:50:34] cuz a tower is a force multiplier.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; That's a you know that's a strategic
[1:50:38] term. Yeah. I may understand what that
[1:50:40] means is that look, you might you might
[1:50:42] be you might not be much of a of a
[1:50:44] warrior [panting]
[1:50:46] down on level ground, but put you up on
[1:50:49] a tower and you hold off 10 men.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz you pile seven de 10 devils up
[1:50:54] on that ladder and all you got to do is
[1:50:56] rip.
[1:50:59] Amen. So being in that tower multiplies
[1:51:01] your force.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. THAT'S THE KIND OF GOD WE
[1:51:05] SERVE. JESUS IS A MULTIPLIER. JESUS,
[1:51:08] TAKE A LITTLE LOAF, JUST ONE LITTLE
[1:51:09] BOY'S LUNCH, AND HE COULD FEED 5,000. HE
[1:51:12] COULD FEED A MULTITUDE. AMEN. JESUS,
[1:51:14] TAKE WATER AND MULTIPLY IT. MAKE IT MORE
[1:51:16] THAN IT IS. AND JESUS, TAKE FISH AND
[1:51:18] MULTIPLY IT. THAT'S WHO HE IS. BUT WHEN
[1:51:21] THE THIRD PULL COME, HE CAN DO YOU
[1:51:23] SOMETHING EVEN BETTER THAN THAT. CUZ I'M
[1:51:24] TELLING YOU, GOD CAN TAKE YOUR LITTLE
[1:51:26] ITTY BITTY LITTLE SELF AND HE CAN MAKE
[1:51:28] he can MULTIPLY IT. HE CAN MULTIPLY YOUR
[1:51:30] FORCE. HE CAN MULTIPLY YOUR POWER. HE
[1:51:32] CAN MAKE YOU A GREAT WARRIOR EVEN IF
[1:51:34] YOU'RE NOTHING. AMEN. EVEN IF YOU'RE
[1:51:37] WEAK, AMEN, HE CAN BE STRONG IN YOU. Cuz
[1:51:40] that's the kind OF GOD HE IS. BUT WHEN
[1:51:42] THE THIRD poll come, Amen. Brother Bam
[1:51:44] said God did something different to
[1:51:45] something like it's never been. He said
[1:51:47] because he didn't just take something
[1:51:48] and multiply it, but he put a squirrel
[1:51:51] where there was nothing at all. So it
[1:51:54] wasn't a work of multiplication. It was
[1:51:56] a work of creation.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; So I'm trying to tell you, long as YOU
[1:52:00] GET IN THIS MESSAGE, YOU CAN BE NOTHING
[1:52:02] AND GOD CAN MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF YOU.
[1:52:04] YES.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. CUZ IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A
[1:52:08] MESSAGE OF CREATION. IT'S A THIRD PULL.
[1:52:10] RESTORATION OF THE SPOKEN WORD. CREATIVE
[1:52:13] POWER.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; IT DON'T MATTER HOW UNBRIDE LIKE YOU
[1:52:16] ARE. GOD IS GOING TO CREATE a bride.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what a security.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; I need to I need to make an example. I
[1:52:27] got to choose someone at random. Samuel,
[1:52:29] stand up.
[1:52:31] [laughter]
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, Samuel, [sighs]
[1:52:35] it appears to me from over here that you
[1:52:38] are not an angel. Is that correct? You
[1:52:40] appeared and now your flesh looks a
[1:52:41] little better than my flesh. But you
[1:52:43] seem to be a flesh man. You ever made a
[1:52:45] mistake, Samuel? Did you ever know to do
[1:52:48] something and you didn't do it? Did you
[1:52:51] ever know not to do something? You did
[1:52:52] it anyway. Yeah. So you you So you
[1:52:55] you're living in flesh imperfection. You
[1:52:57] got you ever felt a complex? You ever
[1:52:59] felt a doubt? You ever felt a fear? And
[1:53:01] I have too. Amen. But keep standing,
[1:53:04] buddy. I want to I want the church to
[1:53:06] take notice. And I want the devil to
[1:53:08] take notice. And I want all heavens and
[1:53:10] earth to take notice. THAT'S THE KIND OF
[1:53:12] person that's going in the rapture.
[1:53:16] [applause]
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS NOT FOR ANGELS. THE
[1:53:22] RAPTURE IS NOT FOR DEVILS. IT'S FOR
[1:53:24] SOMEBODY IN BETWEEN. [applause]
[1:53:32] YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON [applause]
[1:53:34] THAT'S GOING IN RAPTURE.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; I know the DEVIL DON'T LIKE IT.
[1:53:41] [applause] SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN
[1:53:42] LIKE IT, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; GLORY. [cheering]
[1:53:47] I LOVE THAT SONG THAT WE SING. HE'LL
[1:53:49] COME for the weak and the STRONG JUST
[1:53:52] THE SAME. Cuz the RAPTURE AIN'T FOR
[1:53:54] SUPERHUMAN CHRISTIANS. IT'S FOR
[1:53:56] CHRISTIANS WITH A SUPER MESSAGE AND A
[1:53:59] SUPER ANOINTING AND A SUPER CALLING TO
[1:54:02] STAND IN THE TOWER OF IDENTIFICATION AND
[1:54:04] STRIKE THE final blow against death
[1:54:06] itself.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I was listening to
[1:54:11] brother Brandham. Amen. Talk about that
[1:54:12] preview of the bride. Here come the
[1:54:14] American church twisting and perverted
[1:54:17] and awful and dirty. And brother
[1:54:19] Brandham begin to weep. say, he said,
[1:54:22] "After all I've tried,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; after everything I've tried to do,
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; after all of that work," HE SAID, "IS
[1:54:28] THAT ALL that we could produce?"
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; IS THAT ALL? THAT'S THE BEST I COULD DO.
[1:54:33] And I want to say this in full respect
[1:54:35] to the prophet, if it was just William
[1:54:37] Brandham, I believe that is the best he
[1:54:39] could do.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; I believe THAT THAT AMERICAN CHURCH,
[1:54:41] THAT'S THE BEST WE COULD HAVE DONE,
[1:54:43] CHURCH. THAT IS THE VERY BEST WE COULD
[1:54:45] HAVE PUT FORTH
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; IF IT WAS UP TO YOU AND IF IT WAS UP TO
[1:54:48] ME. BUT THANK GOD THERE WAS MORE TO THE
[1:54:50] VISION.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. CUZ HE SAW MORE THAN A BUNCH OF
[1:54:54] LAYOUT OF SEA AND DEATH.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SAW A SINLESS, SPOTLESS,
[1:54:59] VIRTUOUS, HOLY, VICTORIOUS BRIDE.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Christian soldiers.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; I dare say, friends, [panting] see, one
[1:55:09] of these days, I know we live in this
[1:55:11] flesh, but that's what the rapture is
[1:55:13] all about. One of these days, the flesh
[1:55:16] is going to have to yield cuz the word
[1:55:17] will never change.
[1:55:20] And there's not enough strength in the
[1:55:22] weakness of your flesh to make God's
[1:55:24] word alive.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Ah, are you resting in it today?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; You look at Rahab. Rahab stand there
[1:55:31] under her token. Now, now realistically,
[1:55:35] statistically,
[1:55:37] would you have given her any odds of
[1:55:39] survival?
[1:55:40] Knowing her background and knowing her
[1:55:42] situation, knowing her identity, knowing
[1:55:44] where she came from, knowing what kind
[1:55:45] of a people she belonged to and what she
[1:55:47] had been raised under, would you have
[1:55:48] given her a chance? She never should
[1:55:50] have had a chance, but under a token.
[1:55:53] The rest of Jericho could fall, but her
[1:55:55] tower stood standing. Hallelujah,
[1:55:58] friends. Amen. And she was married.
[1:56:00] Amen. To the Amen. to the captain of the
[1:56:02] army. FRIENDS, WE'RE THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:56:04] CHRIST. AMEN. TO THE WORLD, WE MIGHT
[1:56:06] LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF UPJUMP SINNERS. WE
[1:56:09] MIGHT LOOK THEY THEY MIGHT THINK THAT
[1:56:10] WE'RE PROUD AND ARROGANT. AMEN. TO TALK
[1:56:12] ABOUT OUR JUSTIFICATION. AMEN. BUT WE'RE
[1:56:14] NOT LOOKING AT OURSELVES. WE'RE LOOKING
[1:56:16] AT HIM IN WHOM WE ARE IN. WE'RE LOOKING
[1:56:19] AT A MESSAGE. AMEN. Which has washed us
[1:56:22] by the water of the word and has cleaned
[1:56:24] up our reputation and given us a new
[1:56:26] identity. Oh friends.
[1:56:29] Hallelujah. See, that's what that's what
[1:56:31] kills the devil. That's what humiliates
[1:56:33] him. Amen. Because we read in the
[1:56:35] scripture what the devil wanted. He
[1:56:36] said, "I will I'll be like the most
[1:56:38] high. I'll be a god. I'll be a great
[1:56:40] one." He said, "And I'll I'll go up
[1:56:42] there and I'll reside on the sides of
[1:56:44] the north." You know what that sides of
[1:56:46] the north is? That's Zion.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Zion. Amen. That's that's
[1:56:50] that fortress. That's the place. Amen.
[1:56:53] And so, what a humiliation is it to the
[1:56:54] devil. Amen. Being a prince among
[1:56:56] angels. And he had his ambition to sit
[1:56:59] in that place. And for a thousand years,
[1:57:01] he'll have TO NASH HIS TEETH AND SAY,
[1:57:03] "BUT THOSE PEOPLE, I WAS THERE WHEN THEY
[1:57:06] MADE THEIR MISTAKES. I WATCHED THEM WHEN
[1:57:07] THEY SINNED AGAINST GOD. I WATCHED THEM
[1:57:09] WHEN THEY SAID THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T
[1:57:10] HAVE SAID. I WATCHED THEM WHEN THEY DID
[1:57:12] THINGS THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE. I WAS
[1:57:14] THERE." AMEN. AND NOW I GOT TO SIT HERE
[1:57:16] AND WATCH THEM. AMEN. SIT IN THAT
[1:57:18] THRONE. THAT'S WHERE I WANTED TO BE.
[1:57:20] THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY POSITION.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; BUT BY YOUR IDENTIFICATION IN CHRIST,
[1:57:27] THAT THRONE BELONGS TO YOU. THE DEVIL
[1:57:30] CAN'T HAVE IT.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; SIN AND MISTAKES CAN'T KEEP YOU FROM IT.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOURS. [applause]
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, I know that besides
[1:57:42] been throwing a rod at a lot of rocks
[1:57:44] lately. I see it on the countenance of
[1:57:46] young people. I I feel it in the
[1:57:48] atmosphere around around around here
[1:57:50] that that we're always under attack all
[1:57:51] the time. And the devil comes with
[1:57:53] condemnation. The devil comes with guilt
[1:57:55] and shame. And he's trying to just throw
[1:57:56] rocks all the time at people. I'll tell
[1:57:58] you what, I think it's time to throw one
[1:57:59] back for a change.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't Don't let the devil do all
[1:58:03] the rock throwing, friends. Amen. You
[1:58:05] you you take a revelation of this word
[1:58:07] and drop it back down on him. Amen. He
[1:58:10] starts throwing rocks. YOU SAY, "OH, YOU
[1:58:11] KNOW, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT."
[1:58:13] YOU SAY, "I've already made it.
[1:58:17] [applause]
[1:58:18] YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE. I'M GOING TO
[1:58:20] [cheering] BEAT YOU."
[1:58:23] WE ARE HIS VICTORY.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; I'M THE PURE, VIRTUOUS, SINLESS BRIDE OF
[1:58:33] THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, JUSTIFIED.
[1:58:36] NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, let the accuser beware
[1:58:41] cuz that that accuser does a lot of
[1:58:43] talking. He throws a lot of accusations.
[1:58:45] But Jesus told a woman one time that
[1:58:47] those without sin are allowed to throw
[1:58:49] stones. And when YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE
[1:58:52] THAT YOU'RE JUSTIFIED, AMEN. YOU GOT A
[1:58:54] RIGHT TO THROW ROCKS AT THE ENEMY. YOU
[1:58:56] GOT A RIGHT TO STAND ON GOD'S WORD. NO
[1:58:57] MATTER WHAT YOUR FLESH TELLS YOU, NO
[1:58:59] MATTER WHAT YOUR MEMORY TELLS YOU, NO
[1:59:01] MATTER WHAT YESTERDAY TELLS YOU. AMEN.
[1:59:03] YOU STAND IN YOUR TOWER. AMEN. AND DON'T
[1:59:06] DON'T GIVE UP YOUR POSITIVE CONFESSION
[1:59:08] FOR ANYTHING. I'M SINLESS. I'M VIRTUOUS.
[1:59:12] I'M BLOODWASHED. I'M JUSTIFIED. I'M
[1:59:15] ALREADY GLORIFIED.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing you can do about it,
[1:59:18] devil.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what that invincible army
[1:59:24] is, brother Nathan. We're supposed to be
[1:59:25] the invincible army. How could we be
[1:59:28] losing these skirmishes?
[1:59:30] Look, invincible army, a great warrior,
[1:59:33] David. It wasn't about Saul's armor. It
[1:59:37] was about David's faith.
[1:59:40] See, that's why, you know, I'm not
[1:59:42] trying to I feel no burden to try to get
[1:59:45] the bride of Christ to a place where,
[1:59:47] okay, make sure you read the right book.
[1:59:48] Make sure you get in the right program
[1:59:50] and make sure, you know, you you you
[1:59:51] just uh uh come through my my
[1:59:54] psychiatric analysis, you know, and and
[1:59:56] come through, you know, and get under my
[1:59:58] teaching and make sure you go to the
[1:59:59] right church and and all trying to dress
[2:00:00] you up. That might have worked for Saul.
[2:00:02] Actually, it didn't.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; It never did work for Saul. So why would
[2:00:06] David need that? To be an invincible
[2:00:08] warrior. I'll tell you what you need.
[2:00:10] Amen. To go in a rapture. I'll tell you
[2:00:12] what you need to be an invincible army.
[2:00:13] To be an overcome of this of this day,
[2:00:15] you don't need a sinless perfection. You
[2:00:17] don't you you you don't need an angel uh
[2:00:20] uh existence. You just need f a t-

[2:01:03] I'm here to kill your boss.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Cancer.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; I know cancer is a killer, but I'm here
[2:01:13] to kill the killer of all killers.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm here to overcome death itself.
[2:01:17] [laughter]
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Depression.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Pornography.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're a giant, but I'm a
[2:01:23] believer.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; I GOT A ROCK TO THROW. [laughter]
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT FIXING TO LOSE. AMEN. I'M FIXING
[2:01:30] TO I'M FIXING TO LIVE. BROTHER BRAND
[2:01:32] SAID, "I'M NOT GETTING READY TO DIE. I'M
[2:01:34] GETTING READY TO LIVE."
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; How will I do it? I'll do it by abiding
[2:01:39] in my tower. Yes, sir.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; See, Brother Brand, here's here's here's
[2:01:42] a key in the greatest battle ever
[2:01:44] fought. This sermon all about mind
[2:01:45] battles. And brother Brown, he he shows
[2:01:47] you young people how this devil works
[2:01:48] and how he comes and he just starts
[2:01:50] talking and talking and talking and
[2:01:51] talking. He'll tell you about, well, you
[2:01:52] know, you're trying to believe for
[2:01:53] healing and Miss Jones believe for
[2:01:54] healing and it, you know, somebody
[2:01:56] prayed for this and it didn't seem to
[2:01:57] happen and and this happened. Everything
[2:01:58] is all in your mind and everything.
[2:02:00] Brother Bam, that's his tactic. See,
[2:02:02] that's how he works. But Brother Bam
[2:02:04] said, "Look now, now watch your tower."
[2:02:07] He said, "But when you come, it's just
[2:02:08] you and God
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; together and nobody else but you two."
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Just nobody else but you two. He said,
[2:02:14] "There's your battle. Kill him at the
[2:02:17] beginning.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Kill him at the beginning. Stop him dead
[2:02:21] in his tracks.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; It ain't how long you can make the war
[2:02:24] linger.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; It's stop it right now."
[2:02:28] I try to talk about the final blow
[2:02:30] tonight. Amen. Yeah. I know we saw
[2:02:32] healings and deliverances and victories
[2:02:34] last night, but if you find this morning
[2:02:36] that that devil's just wiggling a little
[2:02:38] bit, if there's a little bit of breath
[2:02:39] in him to whisper in your ear, kill it
[2:02:42] right now. Strike your final blow. Amen.
[2:02:46] JUST LET FAITH DROP IN EVERY HEART. I
[2:02:47] PRAY RIGHT NOW TO SAY, "MY ENEMY IS
[2:02:50] DEAD." AMEN. HE'S BEEN PUT TO DEATH. I'M
[2:02:52] STRIKING THE FINAL BLOW. I AIN'T TRYING
[2:02:54] TO MAKE THIS WAR LINGER ON. I'M GOING TO
[2:02:56] KILL HIM RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN THE DEVIL

[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; STOP HIM IN HIS TRACKS in the name of
[2:04:25] Jesus Christ.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Let every devil be bound and defeated.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Friends, one of these days a sweep's
[2:04:35] going to come.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; But you know, he said that rapture would
[2:04:40] be wave after wave after wave of his
[2:04:43] glory. That's what I felt as brother
[2:04:45] Isaac began to preach. I've been under
[2:04:47] them dark clouds just like you. Yeah, I
[2:04:48] know how winter comes in, affects our
[2:04:50] bodies and affects our minds. We get
[2:04:52] under a little bit of darkness, a cloud.
[2:04:54] But as that word is being preached, dark
[2:04:56] clouds begin to roll back. Amen. And
[2:04:58] glory clouds begin to come. Amen. Look,
[2:05:01] friends, one of these Oh, what that what
[2:05:03] was that Friday night? What was that
[2:05:04] last night? Wave, wave. But one OF THESE
[2:05:08] DAYS, ONE LAST SWEEP. ONE MORE. JUST AND
[2:05:11] IT'LL BE JUST LIKE THAT. I BELIEVE JUST
[2:05:13] A JUST ANOTHER WAVE OF HIS PRESENCE.
[2:05:15] JUST THE SAME THING WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
[2:05:17] USED TO, BUT IT'LL STRIKE JUST A LITTLE
[2:05:18] BIT DIFFERENT. AND THE NEXT THING YOU
[2:05:20] KNOW, WE'LL BE IN THAT PLACE. AMEN. It's
[2:05:22] so real.
[2:05:24] [panting]
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; It's so real that we've already got one
[2:05:28] foot in it.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; We're already resurrected.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Just waiting for the body to catch up.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; And then all of our troubles will be
[2:05:38] over.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; It'll all be over. Yeah,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; there won't be no more sickness. There
[2:05:46] won't be no more bad days. There won't
[2:05:48] be no parting. There won't be no more
[2:05:50] sorrow. It'll be over.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Young people say, "I got so much life to
[2:05:55] live." Look, that won't be life won't be
[2:05:56] over when the rapture comes. That's when
[2:05:57] life will start.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; These minds and bodies can't even so
[2:06:02] they can't even wrap their mind around
[2:06:04] it. Good. It'll be so sublime. I would
[2:06:07] hope to think it would only be as good
[2:06:08] as we could imagine. I would hate to
[2:06:10] think that.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it'll be more than we could
[2:06:12] ever imagine.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; And and we're so close, friends,
[2:06:18] if we could just recognize our position.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; If we could recognize the moment, take
[2:06:22] the revelation, and strike the final
[2:06:25] blow.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; When the bride realizes who she is,
[2:06:29] that's not when the rapture will come.
[2:06:31] He said, "That's when the rapture will
[2:06:33] go."
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz we're already in the rapture.
[2:06:39] The cycle's just got to finish.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; We're in the middle of that three-fold.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; And when he comes, he's going to set it
[2:06:47] all right.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; So much wrongness in this world.
[2:06:56] So much corrupt. You can't even You
[2:06:58] can't even You can't even pay attention
[2:07:00] to the news. You can't even just can't
[2:07:02] just got no tolerance for it. just
[2:07:05] instantly dark and pressing and awful
[2:07:06] and corrupt and wicked and just
[2:07:09] everywhere that we look it's wrong. We
[2:07:12] know that. Brother Bram said that's the
[2:07:13] pressure of the age is is is soft living
[2:07:16] in an age that we just are seem unfit to
[2:07:18] live in. It's not right. It's not life.
[2:07:20] It's not reality. It's not it's not what
[2:07:22] we were designed for.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; But when this final blow has been
[2:07:26] struck,
[2:07:28] everything that's wrong will become
[2:07:30] right.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Everything will be set right, friends.
[2:07:33] everything that just bothers us and
[2:07:34] everything everything that torments us
[2:07:36] and I just wish oh it's so unjust it's
[2:07:38] so wicked it's so wrong all that sighing
[2:07:40] and crying will be over and he'll set it
[2:07:42] all right
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; and God shall wipe away all tears from
[2:07:46] their eyes there won't be no more crying
[2:07:48] there shall be no more death neither
[2:07:50] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[2:07:52] any more pain for the former things are
[2:07:54] passed away
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; friends I believe if the rapture is
[2:07:59] going to set everything right this is
[2:08:01] just something that came to
[2:08:02] I believe Friday night kept me up half
[2:08:04] the night. That if this rapture is going
[2:08:07] to set things right,
[2:08:10] then oughtn't a rapture ready church
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; y
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; be able to set some things right?
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; And and I and I got a burden on my
[2:08:19] heart. Say, look, we are the people
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; that are anointed to strike that final
[2:08:24] blow.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to go outside the
[2:08:27] message to find some things that are
[2:08:28] wrong.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. and some things that have gone
[2:08:31] wrong, things that have been handled
[2:08:32] wrong, things that have been believed
[2:08:34] wrong.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, friends, I you you hear
[2:08:37] my burden today. Amen. That that that
[2:08:39] look, let's strike a final blow against
[2:08:41] the devil.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; As long as we're here in a battle, let's
[2:08:44] fight. Amen. Look, look, there there
[2:08:47] could be a church, Amen, where people
[2:08:49] really do love each other. There can be
[2:08:52] a church, YOU DON'T YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
[2:08:53] THAT. I'VE TRAVELED PLACES, you know,
[2:08:55] and preaching places and people talked
[2:08:56] to and and WHAT THEY NEEDED WHAT they
[2:08:58] needed wasn't the sermon that I
[2:09:01] preached,
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; but it was to hear about a church that
[2:09:04] could transfer leadership from one
[2:09:06] pastor to another and not go all to
[2:09:07] pieces.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PEOPLE PEOPLE OUT THERE need they
[2:09:13] need there to be a church. THEY NEED TO
[2:09:14] HEAR ABOUT A ABOUT a lunch like we had
[2:09:17] yesterday where 25 preachers can sit
[2:09:19] down and get along. Amen.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; I believe friends, IF WE CAN SEE WHO WE
[2:09:24] ARE AND WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO, THEN WE
[2:09:26] CAN SET SOME THINGS RIGHT.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MADE FOR THIS
[2:09:30] WORLD, WE'RE MADE FOR THAT ONE. AMEN.
[2:09:32] AND I KNOW WE'RE STUCK IN THESE BODIES,
[2:09:34] BUT WE I BELIEVE WE CAN SET SOME THINGS
[2:09:36] RIGHT BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's that's where my heart is. I
[2:09:41] know I don't belong here, Brother
[2:09:42] Carrie, where everything's corrupt and
[2:09:44] people hurt one another. I belong there
[2:09:46] where where they where they throw their
[2:09:47] arms around another and even sister to
[2:09:49] brother. There'll be twice as much
[2:09:50] hugging over there. Amen. It's a place
[2:09:52] of love. It's a PLACE OF PERFECTION.
[2:09:55] IT'S A PLACE OF FELLOWSHIP. AMEN. BUT
[2:09:57] YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERY SUNDAY I COME TO
[2:09:59] CHURCH AND I GET A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT
[2:10:00] HEAVEN. AMEN. THAT'S WHY I LOVE I DON'T
[2:10:03] JUST LOVE THE MESSAGE. I LOVE MESSAGE
[2:10:04] PEOPLE. AMEN. CUZ THE ONES THAT I KNOW.
[2:10:07] AMEN. I I SEE THEIR HUMANITY, BUT I CAN
[2:10:09] SEE PAST THE VEIL AND I CAN SEE DEITY
[2:10:12] EXPRESSING ITSELF IN A PEOPLE. AMEN. AND
[2:10:15] THAT TELLS ME WE'RE JUST AT THE MOMENT.
[2:10:17] AMEN. TO MAKE THE FINAL STRIKE.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm swinging, amen, with everything
[2:10:22] that I have.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, let us be ready when you
[2:10:26] come.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; It's time to set things right.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; That's what the seventh seal is. Brother
[2:10:31] Bram said, it's the end of struggling
[2:10:33] nature.
[2:10:35] [laughter]
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THAT STRUGGLE, all the
[2:10:38] wrongness, ALL THE CORRUPTION,
[2:10:40] EVERYTHING THAT JUST BOTHERS US. AMEN.
[2:10:44] THE WORD HAS COME TO SET IT ALL RIGHT.
[2:10:46] AMEN.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Heaven came down
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; and opened the seven seals. The mighty
[2:10:54] angel has descended.
[2:10:58] It's the final blow and you're the final
[2:11:01] voice
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; There's a stone in your hand.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Strike your strike.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; I tell you, church,
[2:11:17] Brother Bram said, I was listening to
[2:11:19] him talk about how there's an order to
[2:11:21] the rapture because he said, you know,
[2:11:23] Paul will have his people.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Peter will have his people.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; You know what I was thinking last night
[2:11:29] as we were worshiping the Lord together?
[2:11:31] I said, Lord, maybe it's not just
[2:11:32] messenger and messenger, but I pray when
[2:11:35] I get the over there that my first
[2:11:38] reunion, Amen, is with is with the
[2:11:40] people that I eat with.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Let me let me be over there with True
[2:11:44] Word Tabernacle.
[2:11:47] Let me experience that
[2:11:53] when this this love that we have from
[2:11:55] another, it'll be so unobstructed
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; by fallen human nature. [music]
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; We we just feel it like it should be
[2:12:01] felt. It'll be so real. Noah, I can't
[2:12:06] wait to see your face when we get over
[2:12:08] there. I can't wait.
[2:12:12] [music] Sister Gloria, I don't know
[2:12:14] where you are and we might be a big
[2:12:15] group there. So maybe we won't be just
[2:12:16] quite right next to each other, but I'll
[2:12:18] be listening for you
[2:12:21] over there. I sure will, friends.
[2:12:23] [music]
[2:12:24] Amen.
[2:12:26] And we're right at the door.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; And when brother Ram said that that that
[2:12:31] the [music] we already possess that
[2:12:33] physical resurrection, that means we've
[2:12:34] already got one foot into that realm.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; I'm ready. [music]
[2:12:42] I'm ready. There's nothing left down
[2:12:43] here for me
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; other than to strike my blow and fight
[2:12:47] my fight.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm saying [music] even so,
[2:12:51] Lord, come.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Come, Lord. Give me strength to strike
[2:12:56] [music] the final blow from my
[2:12:57] impregnable tower. Let me not leave my
[2:13:00] place of safety,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; but let me find my safety and security
[2:13:03] in my rest, in my tower of
[2:13:07] identification. [music]
[2:13:10] We'll close on this quote. Brother Bam
[2:13:11] said, "Do you see it?"
[2:13:13] "All creation is groaning," said Paul.
[2:13:16] [music]
[2:13:18] "Everything is groaning. Look at the
[2:13:20] trees, how they struggle. Look at the
[2:13:22] flowers, how they struggle for life,
[2:13:23] just for frost to tear him down. Look at
[2:13:25] the trees, how they struggle to hold
[2:13:27] their branches out to sing glories unto
[2:13:29] God. [music] Everything, all nature, all
[2:13:31] animals, all birds, how he flies from
[2:13:33] the enemy quickly and gets away.
[2:13:34] Everything is groaning. And we
[2:13:36] ourselves, said Paul, [music] we groan
[2:13:40] for we're waiting for the redemption of
[2:13:42] our body. [music] But brother Rah say,
[2:13:45] but now
[2:13:46] now
[2:13:48] they did all those years until now.
[2:13:52] [music] Now now we have the earnest of
[2:13:54] our inheritance.
[2:13:56] We have the evidence that God lives.
[2:14:00] How could you how could you have been
[2:14:01] there last night and not say we have the
[2:14:02] evidence that God is with us? Yeah,
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; he has not forsaken us. We are his. He
[2:14:07] is ours
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; because we in our bodies now tabernacle
[2:14:11] [music] the Holy Spirit of God that
[2:14:12] cries out, "Aba, Father." Yes, sir.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing [music] can ever
[2:14:18] take that away.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; We are anchored in Christ.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you. There'll [singing] be no
[2:14:28] war. [music]
[2:14:34] There'll be no [singing] pain. [music]
[2:14:42] Come [singing]
[2:14:43] Jesus, come. [music]
[2:14:50] Let today be [music] the day
[2:14:54] [singing]
[2:14:58] you come [music] for [singing] the weak
[2:15:05] [music]
[2:15:06] and the [singing] strong just the same.
[2:15:12] [music]
[2:15:15] All will [singing]
[2:15:16] believe
[2:15:22] in the power of [music and singing]
[2:15:25] his name.
[2:15:30] Oh, [singing] one day he'll come [music]
[2:15:39] and we'll stand [singing] face to face.
[2:15:42] [music]
[2:15:47] Come and lay it all down
[2:15:53] [music]
[2:15:55] cuz it might [singing] be today.
[2:16:04] The time [music and singing]
[2:16:05] is right now.
[2:16:12] There's [singing] no [music] need to
[2:16:14] wait.
[2:16:19] Oh, [music and singing]
[2:16:20] your cast will be washed
[2:16:27] by [singing] rivers of grace. [music]
[2:16:34] [singing]
[2:16:36] Come Jesus, come.
[2:16:41] [music]
[2:16:42] Oh, we've [singing] been waiting so long
[2:16:47] [music]

[2:16:58] and [singing] write every wrong.

[2:17:31] Come,
[2:17:37] come [music] Jesus. Come.
[2:17:43] [music] Oh, sometimes [singing]
[2:17:45] I fall.
[2:17:48] Yes, Lord [music]
[2:17:51] to my [singing] knees and pray.
[2:17:57] [music]
[2:17:59] Come Jesus come.
[2:18:05] Let [music] today be the day. [singing]
[2:18:13] Sometimes I [singing and music] feel
[2:18:20] like I'm going to bring [music]
[2:18:23] [singing]
[2:18:26] Oh,
[2:18:28] but I'm holding on. [music]

[2:18:59] to healing. [music]
[2:19:01] Lord, write every wrong.
[2:19:04] Yes, Lord. [music]
[2:19:07] Every wrong. [singing]
[2:19:09] We need
[2:19:13] [music]
[2:19:15] [singing]

[2:19:23] Deep down.
[2:19:25] This world is not my home. So come

[2:19:30] Hallelujah.
[2:19:32] [music] Come.

[2:43:25] Glory.
[2:43:30] I just want [music] to say as an elder
[2:43:34] this morning,
[2:43:36] I'm proud of you young brothers.
[2:43:40] What a what a what a matured word.
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; And I I I'm not just giving glory to the
[2:43:48] [music] flesh, but to the God that's in
[2:43:50] you.
[2:43:53] And you [music] you might not believe
[2:43:54] this.
[2:43:56] Well, I believe you could.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; I was thinking to myself, I think it was
[2:44:03] even this morning or last night. I wish
[2:44:05] somebody preached on the resurrection.
[2:44:12] [applause]
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:44:21] [applause]
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; resurrection and rapture because there's
[2:44:26] so much there in the message of the hour
[2:44:29] [music] and that's what we're all about.
[2:44:34] Brother, we might have a lot of gray
[2:44:36] hair,
[2:44:37] but one of these days we're going to
[2:44:38] have all black,
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:44:42] I don't know. I'm really touched by the
[2:44:44] Lord this morning. I I was touched in
[2:44:46] all three meetings.
[2:44:48] I don't know I don't know about you, but
[2:44:51] when you get in the spirit of the Lord,
[2:44:52] it's another dimension.
[2:44:55] &gt;&gt; It's an allgether different dimension.
[2:44:58] Thank you, brother Wayne, for you know,
[2:45:00] I I was telling brother Wayne in the
[2:45:02] back room, what a meeting. But I said,
[2:45:06] you must had the leadership of the Lord
[2:45:07] to have these meetings in January.
[2:45:10] And we had [music] a 60 60° the other
[2:45:12] day, so we had good weather on top. God
[2:45:15] bless you. We love you. Thank you for
[2:45:19] your leadership, Brother Wayne.
[2:45:22] And uh you know what's going to happen?
[2:45:24] We're not leaving a one behind.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Not a one behind.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our hearts? Lord Jesus,
[2:45:35] [snorts]
[2:45:36] I'm so touched in my heart this morning
[2:45:43] sitting under the
[2:45:45] word for these three meetings
[2:45:50] and seeing how you have come Lord and
[2:45:55] you've sanctioned [snorts] it Lord with
[2:45:57] your presence.
[2:46:01] There was more than just the mechanics
[2:46:03] here this weekend.
[2:46:06] You, the dynamic one,
[2:46:10] came on the scene
[2:46:14] and Father,
[2:46:18] Lord, this is [music] a reality. Lord,
[2:46:22] this is something that's beyond human
[2:46:25] reasoning.
[2:46:30] Father, I thank you for every messenger
[2:46:32] [music] of every age.
[2:46:36] God, they had a part,
[2:46:41] a part of the kingdom.
[2:46:44] But Lord, we're living in the end time,
[2:46:46] Lord,
[2:46:49] where the kingdoms of this world
[2:46:53] will become the kingdoms of our Christ.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; Father, it seems like it can't be much
[2:47:03] further down the road.
[2:47:06] [music]
[2:47:08] I even believe at my age, I can still
[2:47:10] see it.
[2:47:16] It could be that close. Lord,
[2:47:20] bless these three young men, Lord God. I
[2:47:23] pray you bless them. [music]
[2:47:26] thinking about brother Ronnie and
[2:47:28] telling about the the migraine he had
[2:47:31] all night.
[2:47:35] [music] There's a price to pay, Lord,
[2:47:37] under the nervous tension and the stress
[2:47:41] of ministering.
[2:47:44] I pray you bring healing to this
[2:47:46] congregation,
[2:47:48] whoever is sick and afflicted.
[2:47:55] Father, I pray Lord as we depart
[2:47:58] that the angel of the Lord will go with
[2:48:00] each one, Lord, [music]
[2:48:02] and protect them on the roads and give
[2:48:04] them a good week.
[2:48:07] We give you the praise and we give you
[2:48:09] the honor and we give you the glory.
[2:48:12] [music]
[2:48:13] We love you with all our hearts
[2:48:18] in Jesus name. [music]
[2:48:19] Amen.
[2:48:21] God bless you as you go shake hands with
[2:48:24] one another. Go quietly out of the
[2:48:26] building and out of the sanctuary
[2:48:28] rather. God bless you.
