[1:59] high Energy Event you're going to enjoy
[2:02] it uh we just like to have a good time
[2:05] here um and uh enjoy ourselves I think
[2:09] Christians should be the
[2:11] happiest uh freest most fun-loving
[2:14] people relaxed people amen not pressured
[2:17] people you know uh we've got the joy of
[2:21] the Lord so we just have a good time and
[2:24] keep a good spirit amen so uh that
[2:27] what's going to be going on today if
[2:29] it's your first time here what we do on
[2:31] Saturday morning uh we take our morning
[2:33] assembly and we'll just stretch it out
[2:34] for about an for about an hour total uh
[2:37] and we're going to have a time of
[2:39] worship now uh what I we'll have a
[2:42] couple specials we'll sing some songs
[2:44] but uh I want you to have the right idea
[2:46] about what we're doing this is not a
[2:48] concert this is not performance this is
[2:51] worship and so we've come together to
[2:53] get a one mind one Accord and make the
[2:56] praise and worship of Jesus Christ the
[2:57] center of what we're doing here so so
[3:00] you know uh it'll be up to you Amen to
[3:04] enter into it that's what it'll make
[3:07] that's what'll bring the presence of the
[3:08] Lord that's what it'll make we've always
[3:09] had a powerful time of worship on
[3:12] Saturday morning of camp but that's
[3:14] that's your participation amen uh uh and
[3:18] and this is praise you know we say we're
[3:20] a place without pressure and this is
[3:21] praise without
[3:23] pressure praise without pressure I'd
[3:25] like to uh take a moment on that that
[3:28] you know young people sometimes will
[3:30] come to a camp meeting or be in a
[3:33] service where the spirit of the Lord's
[3:34] really moving and people are jumping and
[3:36] shouting and everything and uh some
[3:38] people a little more quiet maybe or a
[3:40] little more reserved or maybe you just
[3:41] got a lot going on in your life and and
[3:44] you're just not maybe not feeling it in
[3:46] that moment and how how many's ever
[3:48] experienced that where that then that
[3:50] brings a pressure on you right you get
[3:52] under pressure well you know what she's
[3:55] she's dancing and he's shouting and that
[3:59] one's raising what's wrong with me and
[4:00] it becomes a pressure and it starts to
[4:02] build up and you just you get all worked
[4:04] up in your mind uh the presence of the
[4:06] Lord is not a place of pressure it's a
[4:08] place to let off the
[4:10] pressure let off the pressure it's not
[4:12] you know it's not uh trying to do what
[4:14] somebody else is doing it's just
[4:16] entering into fellowship with God on
[4:18] your in your own individual heart and
[4:20] you just begin to enter into that you
[4:22] and and before long you might be dancing
[4:24] too amen but you see that's that's not
[4:27] what we're about trying to trying to to
[4:29] pump people up and trying to put
[4:31] pressure until something happens or make
[4:33] you do something that's
[4:35] Pentecostalism Pentecostalism is when
[4:37] you start beating the people if you
[4:38] don't jump if you don't shout if you
[4:40] don't dance if you don't act like
[4:41] everybody else you're not spiritual you
[4:43] know that's not worship amen but worship
[4:46] comes from the heart amen and so th
[4:50] that's so don't get it twisted now we
[4:51] want we want freedom we want Liberty and
[4:56] Liberty is not me telling you what to do
[4:58] but Liberty is you in your heart you
[5:00] begin to amen you begin to listen to the
[5:03] word you begin to feel the presence of
[5:05] the Lord and you begin to say Lord I
[5:07] love
[5:08] you Lord I'm not feeling it today Lord
[5:12] I've been going through a lot but I love
[5:14] you and you're worthy of my
[5:17] praise amen you see worship begins and
[5:20] ends with the worthiness of Jesus Christ
[5:24] amen because whether you feel like
[5:26] worshiping him he's worthy of it if you
[5:28] don't feel like worshiping him he's
[5:30] still worthy of it amen sometimes uh
[5:33] sometimes we get the attitude like
[5:34] unless an Angel takes you by the hand or
[5:36] the presence of the Lord the spirit of
[5:38] the Lord comes over you so strong it
[5:40] just takes over your body you know that
[5:42] we can't dance and sing and worship and
[5:44] raise our hands and no no no amen that
[5:48] that's all right too but he's worthy of
[5:50] all of our praise if you've got breath
[5:52] in your lungs he's worthy amen of an
[5:55] amen and a Hallelujah and a thank you
[5:57] Jesus and praise the Lord isn't he
[6:00] worthy amen he's the only one worthy of
[6:03] Praise amen uh we're not here to lift up
[6:07] any celebrity we're not here to lift up
[6:09] any influencer we're not here to lift up
[6:11] any uh uh any Ministry any church any
[6:15] personality amen but we're lifting up
[6:17] Jesus Christ amen because he said if I
[6:20] be lifted up I there will be a draw and
[6:23] I will draw all men unto me amen he's
