[0:07] [Music]
[0:17] I got in.
[0:20] It ain't looking good. I ain't going to
[0:22] lie. Arrows flying, devils trying to
[0:25] make me think I'm going down the stairs.
[0:28] You might think that I'd be afraid.
[0:31] Running scared with a shaking faith. The
[0:33] God I know says it ain't over. The God I
[0:37] know is going to make a way.
[0:42] Though I walk
[0:44] through the valley,
[0:48] I will have no fear, no fear, no fear.
[0:56] The mighty power of Jesus is fighting
[0:59] for me. No fear, no fear, no fear.
[1:06] The light of the world makes the
[1:10] darkness disappear. No fear.
[1:15] My life.
[1:23] No fear when I'm walking through the
[1:24] fire. Cuz I know who's walking me
[1:27] through. No fear when the flood waters
[1:30] rise. If I got my eyes on you.
[1:34] You
[1:36] know,
[1:39] the mighty power of Jesus is my
[1:53] My heart is disappearing.
[2:05] Not over my family,
[2:08] not over my future,
[2:11] not over.
[2:13] God,
[2:16] not over.
[2:26] [Applause]
[2:31] Heat
[2:38] up
[2:46] here.
[3:03] Heat. Heat.
[3:13] Though I walk
[3:16] through the valley,
[3:20] I will
[3:31] Heat. Heat.
[3:43] Yeah. Heat.
[3:54] Yeah. Heat.
