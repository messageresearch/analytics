Heavenly Father we welcome your presence here today as we gather together to witness Jeffrey and Lydia taking sacred vows that will join them together as husband and wife we ask that you will bless this day and our time spent together for this occasion bless this couple and make them a blessing all the days of their life for we ask this in Jesus name amen amen amen amen God bless you it's certainly an honor to be here today and to be able to be a part of this wonderful ceremony we want to thank each and every one of you that was able to come today to witness this um it's an amazing thing how much is done for a ceremony for a wedding ceremony but we know that it's done that way because it's a very important day this is a bride's day it's a day when the Lord has put these two together it was so important marriage that even the Lord visited a wedding and that was where he first uh began his works of Miracles was at a wedding and uh today we want to invite him to be a part of this wedding that he might be able to do something here a miracle like he done there but this time a miracle would be taking two lives and making them one in the scriptures the first marriage that it's recorded God performed himself the Bible tells us that he made man and when God looked upon man he said it's not good that a man should dwell long so I will make him help me and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and he brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to the cattles and to the fowl of the air and the Beast of the field but for Adam there was no any help meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and he closed up his flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said now this is bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife as they shall be one flesh there was a lot of there was a lot of animals in the garden but Adam was still alone it's not it's not that other people are not around or that there's not a world of people but a person can live in the world live alone and not have that that part of him that God created for him brother bham says that the greatest thing that God could give a man outside of Salvation is a wife and she's to comfort him to help him to bless him and to console him and to be a real companion to him so God didn't only just give Adam animals and companion ship in that manner but he gave one that he brought from his own self uh the scripture records that the that the bone was taken from his rib wasn't taken from his head because a woman should never rule over a man was not taken from his foot because a woman should never be under the foot of a man but it was taken from the rib out of his side next to his heart because that's where a woman should walk a wife should be is next to a man the one that God created for you I believe it's Eternal I believe God makes Eternal mates the prophet of God said love never did begin and it never will end and it's Eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman and he marries her just because she's pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds the man that she loves and no matter what he looks like he loves her and she loves him that's an eternal Maiden Glory death nor nothing else will ever separate them because they are from eternity and they stepped out into a space of time and will return back to Eternity eternity drop down in a body called time then it goes right back up into eternity again I believe when God brings two together for marriage he's bringing together those Eternal mates that was a part of of each other to begin with and a part of each other today to thank God and could bring together a man and a woman and you've had a lot of relationships in your life with your parents with your families with your churches but this will be the most important relationship of your life this relationship will go far beyond any relationship you've ever known and you too will be placed together to fulfill what I believe is a deeper purpose for God what one person maybe you serve God and he's give you a purpose in this life but when you come together as a man and wife you as Christians will be able to do your purpose on Earth much better than you could alone see it's not good that a man dwell alone one of the wisest men who ever live said this that two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall they have one to lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone that faileth for he have no one to help him and again if two lie together then they have no heat but how could be one warm alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withstanding and a three-fold cord is not easily broken then therefore it's not just that God puts two together but there must be a third one there must be an extra person in this marriage and that third person must be God the Bible says in Ephesians 5 that wives should submit their themselves under their husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is savior of the body therefore as the church is subject so let wives be subject unto their own and husbands should love their wives the scripture tells us that every man has a head and that head is God and that every woman has a head and that's her husband husband and when you have a man under God and a woman under that man the three of them together will make a a three-fold cord that cannot be easily broken because in your life comes God and God himself the Bible said is love and one thing we found out about love is Love Never Fails love always makes a way when there is no way I I would say today as you in this wedding Arrangement and you're having this ceremony you're going to leave here today there's a lot of advice you're going to get in your marriage but the real advice and the greatest advice you'll ever receive is love one another if you really just fall in love with one another so deeply love will make a way when there's just no way love will cause you to forgive one another love will cause you to be able to stop speak to one another and love is proven that it'll be able to keep together a home even against the test of time marriage is a miracle and I believe a miracle that should be a miracle of love Paul explains love when he says love is patient and it's able to ex it it's patient and let me just say it like this it's able to accept or tolerate delays problems suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious love is kind charity envieth not charity vth not itself and it does not boast it is not puffed up and it's not proud it doeth not behave itself unseemly love is never rude see it seeketh not its own it's not even selfish it's not easily provoked it doesn't become angry quickly it thinketh no evil and this is one of my favorite parts of the scripture where it says love think no evil because what it really is speaking of is love does not keep a records of wrong that's one of the most powerful things that could be given in a home and I'll say today as a guest it's not just in just this home but it would be good in every home in every church and every marriage if we was like God who kept no wrong who we we marked not wrong we didn't impute the trespasses one to the other but yet there was forgiveness the Bible said rejoiceth not in iniquity but of rejoice and truth it beareth all things Love cover all things it believeth all things it hopeth all things and here's the thing it endureth all things and charity never fails love fails not at any time I just love this that love cannot fail so if you want a marriage that lasts and a marriage that can stand the test and trials of life just love one another deeply and the more you love the Greater Life you'll have Jeffrey at this time we're going to enter the vows the ceremony Jeffrey will thou have this woman to be thy wted wife to live

the W in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lydia what token do you give an acknowledgement of your vows you place this ring on the ring finger of Jeffrey's left

and Lydia for as much as you've considered together in holy W wedlock and have witnessed the same before God and the friends and have acknowledged your vows with the tokens of these rings I by the virtue of the authority that has invested me as a minister of the word of God in the state of Ohio I pronounce anounce unto you husband and wife together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to whom God hath joined together let no man put aunder now you might at this time maybe you've attended many weddings and you've always seen it in the pictures of how that a bride wears a veil this Veil wearing came from the scriptures as early back as when Isaac and Rebecca were married the Bible tells us that Rebecca left her home and Isaac his father's tent and they met in a field and the Bible tells us that while elaser was leading Rebecca into the field that Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lit off of her camel for she said unto the servant what man is this that walketh to meet us in the field and the servant had said it's my master and therefore she took a veil and she covered her face the prophet of God says this why does a woman every time she gets married put a veil over her face it's because she's coming to her husband the head just like Rebecca she put a veil over her face to meet Isaac she has no more head Isaac is her head and the church ought to be submissive to the word that it veils its own face see the nature of a woman is to submit to a man and that's what the church ought to do submit to Christ and his word and his doctrines for she takes no thought for herself she now she has no head Christ is her head now the Bible records in Revelations 3 when it's writing to the Philadelphian age it says this thing saith he he that is Holy and he that is true and he that hath the Key of David and he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man open the scripture is declaring that the Lord Jesus is the one that's the ruler over the church in this in the exposition of the church ages the prophet takes this and says what that Key of David signifies is a mere Shadow being fulfilled now in Jesus standing in the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his Earthly pilgrimage but what does this key signify is the answer lays in the position of the key for the key was not in his hand but it was worn around it was not worn around his neck it was not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could have not have said he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does a shoulder have to do with it in Isaiah 9:6 the Bible said the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer lies the phrase the government on his shoulder it comes from a wedding in the Eastern ceremony when the bride has been committed to the groom that she takes off her veil and places it on the groom's shoulder signifying not only is she un under his Dominion but she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right or any responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he forew this and today we're going to fulfill this ceremony as our brother David would come to transfer this Veil to this man as the father would place this Veil upon the husband's right shoulder it is a symbol of the transference of headship from a father to a husband Jeffrey you may kiss your bride [Applause] at this time we have a Unity not time a symbol of that three-fold chord [Music] you believe in me and I believe in you we believe we found something worth holding on to We Can't Stop there cuz that won't be enough to make it work to make it last when the life we share gets tough we're not in this thing alone and we won't get it right on our own it's going to take help it's going to take Faith but with you and God and Me 1 + 1 = 3 34 in a stray we're too strong to break with one love bigger than us every time we pray so if we're in the rain or if we're in the clear we're going to be all right cuz all we need we got right here yeah we're not in this thing theone and we won't get it right all and all it's going to take help it's going to take Faith but with you and God and me 1+ one equals 3 [Music] oh oh wo oh cuz we're not in this thing we can't get it right all and all it's going to take hell it's going to take Faith but with you and God and me one plus one equals 3 it's going to take help it's want to take Faith but with you and God and Me One 1al [Music] 3 at this time we're going
