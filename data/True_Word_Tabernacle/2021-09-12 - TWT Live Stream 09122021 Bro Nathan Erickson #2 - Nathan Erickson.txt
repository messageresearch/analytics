TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we find that the tree of knowledge provides an abundance of comforts hey man people are people are in in a certain way healthier than they've ever be been before at least they've better better health care than they've ever had before more intelligent than they've ever been before amen they have more conveniences more pleasures more comforts than they ever had before but it's all from the tree of knowledge but the tree of life that's meant to be our satisfaction and so the christian is separated from these things and have you ever thought about it this way you know there's something i think that happens in the christian life especially for a young person that's raised in church and they're raised really in a religious home and they're raised to follow certain rules and do certain things and so it colors their perception of what the christian life is it's a life of separation and and to a young person that seems like works it seems like rules or regulations or or or or or certain burdens that are placed on their shoulder but did you know brother brown preached that message that god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief could i spin that around amen and make you look at it from a little bit different perspective today god's word offers a total separation from unbelief amen you know there's a life in christ that's that that is available to the christian amen that it's not a burden to you it's a relief it's not a amen it's not a it's not a it's not a a work or an effort it's actually a release it's actually a refuge amen how many know what i'm talking about today amen that's a reality friends and god's word is offering you a place where you can get to a christ where you can escape this eden and escape this rat race and get out of break the cycles amen of this generation amen and get in there with god amen oh it offers a separation it offers a hiding place it offers a refuge but you know brother braham said man hasn't changed very much he's still wandering about in the world seeking pleasure amen talking about how got man left the garden of eden and he wandered and he said now he's still wandering he's seeking pleasure he's restless he's never satisfied he's never come into any right conclusions never finding rest he's just about in the same condition that he was when he left god in the garden of eden and went out to shift for himself and he's been shifting ever since he's been shifting ever since and he finds it's a rough way to go maybe that would prick a heart this morning of a of a of a son or daughter of god who's living a religious life join a church believing god sent a prophet and acquainted with the culture of of the message of the hour amen but you find that there's something in your heart though you have not found that satisfaction you're restless you're shifting from place to place oh friends there's an eden for you amen there is a satisfaction for that thirst on the inside amen but you find you see most of the issues that we're facing down here is because we're chasing substitutes instead of the hidden manna that's behind the veil but the hidden life in christ doesn't need a substitute it doesn't hunger it doesn't thirst it's not looking for a refuge amen but it's founded satisfaction behind the veil in jesus christ now amen now bear with me now we're just laying a foundation and you see you find that uh that you're not supposed to be part of this world or you're not compatible with this world you're like israel you're a chosen people you're called out and we find that you're a spiritual israel what does that mean it means this world's full of temples this world is full of religions and movements and groups and peoples amen in the days of the bible the world was full of temples it was full of worshipers but there was only one people that had an ark amen that was that spiritual israel and that's what the bride of jesus christ has by the message of the hour amen everybody's got churches everybody's got good pastors everybody sings good songs and enjoys getting together and enjoys the social side of it but you've got an ark you've got a hiding place you've got a refuge you can get away from this world where it doesn't matter what they say or how they think you want to live your life or what you need to buy or what you need to be a part of or what you need to watch or consume your thirst and your hunger is satisfied with the hidden manna hallelujah you're the only one with an ark and watch what that means now brother band said when a man gets a hold of anything he perverts the main cause he said make see what is perversion making something different from the original watch god made man to live happily with one another amen perversion change them makes them enemies man makes us enemies while god made us brothers man made men to be immoral god made man to live true to his wife god gave us cool good clear water to drink man's got to mix alcohol or something else with it before he drinks it it's perverting from the real beginning of it amen this is from the beginning of what's not so and in doing so he said now taking it to the spiritual we find it in the church these things have taken place because man began to tamper into the things of god and he draws his conception of what it means he doesn't just take it the way it's written but he gets his own idea mixed into it and then by that he makes a tradition and he teaches that and jesus said when he was on the earth and found such he said in vain do you worship me amen now there is then possibility and it is so that there can be a genuine worship of god but wrong amen now we know about satan's eden we know about a generation of people who are worshiping the devil brother brahm said anointed ones at the end time and all those things that he taught but he said he said we find that there's a possibility of a genuine worship of god but wrong he said in vain they worship me why teaching for doctrine the commandments of men now we don't have a church creed but we've got personal opinions amen we've got we've got individual backgrounds we've got cultures and we've got family spirits and national spirit we've got all these things that are at play in the church it's no different amen than a denominational creed when you begin to take the word of god but you're trying to substitute your own opinion you're trying to make this message fit you you're trying to make this life compatible with uh with what your your tastes and your interests and things like that it doesn't work like that friends can you imagine and it's a true worship of god but it's in vain in vain he said they worship me why because instead of taking what i have offered them they're looking for their substitute they're chasing after something else amen so it becomes in vain just like we read the quote last thursday it's just enough religion to make you miserable oh that's a relatable statement just enough religion to make you miserable just like adam and eve when they chase out the garden they tried to cover their nakedness with fig leaves and brother bam said those fig leaves was man-made religion amen man made religion man tampered man perverted amen man oh friends that's not just denominational amen that's any man or woman who's trying to tamper amen with what god has given us amen but when you drink freely when you drink freely when you when you when you come with oh my and drink fully of the word of god it's a different experience it's a different experience amen because see in vain you worship me teaching traditions brother braham said they swapped the in the nicean council there that that that eve fell that original church fell at the nicene council why because they swapped the word of god for the wisdom and culture for the wisdom and culture of man see sometimes it's not the doctrine that's the problem it's the culture the culture of man and that's the same thing lucifer did in the garden of eden and they died right there the pentecostal church died at nicaea but to be resurrected in the bride tree amen now see there's plenty of nominal message believers with a man-made religion i think we understand these things but we've got to check ourselves amen so we won't we won't linger on that too long but but jesus said in vain do you worship me teaching traditions teaching tradition now he said it was not so here's what we're coming to it was not so from the beginning in the beginning we didn't have all these trappings of religion in the beginning it wasn't a social group in the beginning there wasn't a culture around it there weren't all these traditions there wasn't all this backstory there weren't all these this water under the bridge and fightings and feuds and and history and and this church and that church and that ministry and this there was none of that in the beginning was the garden and in the garden it was god and his son god and his daughter alone no no church no history no creed no opinions no tampering it was god and his children in the beginning that's what it was you know it's no coincidence brother branham preached the message he preached actually a series on why we are not a denomination why we're not a denomination and he's trying to free the people from the culture and from that mindset trying to fit into that denominational structure because it can never it can never uh it can never bring us to where the lord's trying to take us amen why we're not a denomination and the very first thing he preaches after establishing why we're not a denomination is it was not so from the beginning you see what he's trying to do trying to take you back beyond the church experience beyond the joining beyond the religion beyond the culture and the and all those things and take us back to the beginning what does that mean back to eden back to the original worship amen it was not so from the beginning it wasn't man in the world it wasn't man in the church it was man and god and i believe this message came to take us back to that amen that's what i'm longing for that's what i'm looking for in the message of the hour that's what it means to me it's my it's my avenue the veil is open i can get back to that place where i can get past the church pass the family pass the history pass the creed pass the culture or the opinions and get back to the garden with god amen shut into that holy of holies an individual affair with god the message came for that see the message is taking us back it's restoring us back not just to pentecost not just to the upper room it's taking us all the way back to eden that's what it was sent to do i've got the quotes and we're getting to them amen but watch now what this message came to do brother brown said in the message the messiah this is powerful he said when a man is born again with the spirit of god god's spirit dwells in him and as he can let that spirit grow here's what you do young person with a new birth god gives you experience god fills you with the holy ghost let that grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press god's way through him again now if you'll let that happen brother brown said a man can become back in the same condition that he was in the garden of eden you believe that friends he said you can go you can there's a way there's a way you can get back to the same condition that he was in the garden of eden verily verily if i say any you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but you can have what you said brother brown said that puts him right back supreme again it puts him right back in the condition amen no wonder friends no wonder those that are baptized with the holy ghost they struggle to fit into this world and they're struggling with this society and this culture because you're not compatible with satan's paradise you're of another eden you're of another land another existence amen another another oh another environment that's why power comes by the holy ghost what is that power it's the power of the adamic covenant amen it's eden power restored to the human race if he could speak to the wind if adam could speak to a tree and cause it to move then you can speak to your storm you can speak to your mountain as the brother said recently your mountain your voice why because of a power that's been restored to the people of god that's the reality friends you want to talk about the third pole amen uh what is this third pool anime why would god share a sovereign power like that with human beings must be because he wants them to have it must be because in the beginning that's the way it was amen not just a sovereign god but a man brother graham said an omnipotent in the human flesh and when those two omnipotents meet it's back to eden again back to ian again you believe that friends where god's trying to take us now we know about a millennium we know about things that are laying on the other side but what about right here in the middle of satan's eden friends amen god god did not send us a message to make us cope with this eden he sent a message to call us out and if we're called out then what are we called to heavenly places in christ jesus another eden it's another eden oh my brother and he wants you to have it the message pardoned brother brown's speaking about the love that he had for the human race and yet he had to see them separated from him see we're talking about a loving god and having to see his children separated from him and eating amen and the fellowship that he had with his children the garden guard him it wasn't an angry god it wasn't a god that said well i never liked them anyway they they did they didn't listen to my word they fell for the satan's lies i'm kicking them out it wasn't like that brother bram said he was in a heartbroken condition and he has been all the time because his word said the day you eat there of that day you die so what did he do in his heart broken condition amen when we were when our race was cast out of eden amen he sent jesus sin his only begotten son amen when when the the when the eden covenant said if you eat it you'll die amen but he said jesus who said whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die they shall not taste of this of this spiritual death hallelujah eden's what he wants friends he's building us a future home that's god's desire to take you to eden it's god's desire to fellowship with you it's god's desire to take you back to that place to that existence then why should the backslider say well if god even wants me back why should we why should we allow condemnation to crawl up on us and say god never loved you anyway you were never good enough you're not accepted no amen i'm talking about a loving god amen who's been heartbroken ever since you left the garden of eden ever since his children were cast out of his presence his heart has been broken and the desire of the very heart of god is to bring it back bring it back to bring you back hallelujah amen oh my a future home now brother bram said it's a revelation christ the mystery of god revealed it's as eternal as god's word is eternal look at the threefold purpose of god god manifested in christ christ manifested in the church in order to what what's it all about what's the third poll all about what's the seventh seal all about what's the message of the hour amen god sent a message what is the message here is where brother brandon brought it to a culmination in order to redeem the lost eve back to the original condition in the garden of eden you know we just got to pause and think that's what he wants that's what he wants and that ought to that ought to flips the devil's narrative on its head in your life amen when we begin to think well what does god want maybe god doesn't uh maybe god's angry with me maybe maybe god has rejected with me maybe i'm not gonna make it maybe the rapture is not for me but eden is what he wants for you god's desire is to take you unto himself and call you out of this world shut you in with god it's his desire now that's a revelation amen but you'll have to see the picture of this message what he's been going after the whole time it changes the narrative brother man said he's that seed the woman's seed the tree of life in the garden he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace curses he that hang on a tree and he became a curse for the human race and watch this now that through that he brings forth a bright tree now what is that bride tree brother bram said which will be the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden hallelujah why did god call a bride what are you to him amen you're more than you're more than a fallen creature amen more than a sinner saved by grace god has restored his bride back and this bride tree is none other than the same tree of life which was granted into the root oh i know satan has eaten at it i know every pest out of hell amen has tried to bring false religion on you to put creeds on you to try to bury this tree but the life of this tree cannot be stopped amen because it's driven by the power of god's own desire and god has restored a bride and she is the tree of life that takes it right back to husband and bride back to the garden again oh glory to god by the same word and the same god made manifest in husband and wife you're not just eating from the tree of life you're not just you're not a grafted amen you are the tree of life of the same nature of the same species of the same origin the original seed amen but now it's been restored now it's bearing fruit now the work is coming to completion and what do we find right back to the garden again under the leaves of that bride tree amen where's satan's eden that's the son of this wilderness is beating down on you all the time trying to dry you out amen the winds blowing through trying to bring a chill on you bring a lukewarm christianity bring confusion amen there's a refuge under the leaves of this bride tree amen under there in an age where the love of many shall wax cold this tree's got leaves of fellowship and when the holy ghost moves to the church you hear the noise of those leaves clapping amen you hear that russell and under there a brother amen can embrace a brother and a sister could take a sister by the hand amen there's love there there's unity there there's brotherhood there in that bride tree and in a world that's starving to death you're under you found a shelter in this bride in this message you can just reach out anytime and take the fruit of this tree amen you can eat from a brother amen god puts a gift in a church to sing you can lift your hands and be blessed it can change your atmosphere change your circumstances gotta raise up a minister with a word just for you just for the moment just for the day hallelujah and you just are eating that fruit where are you you're back to that tree of life back to eden again i know the world is in satan's eden but we're not we're not the bible says he'll this believer he'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaf will not wither and whatever he does will prosper what is that tree it's an eden tree it's the bride tree ever since adam left eden god's every action and desire has been working to bring him back to bring him back it broke the heart of god to cast adam out but god's bringing you back hallelujah it's his desire it's his action it's his heart every prophet every messenger every miracle the manna everything amen that's what he had in mind with all of it was to take a bride back to eden to take his children back to eden now we find ourselves how many believe we've come to the culmination of time you really believe that we've come we're the final we're hearing the final voice of the final age and the whole drama of redemption has come to its pinnacle and we've come to that moment what do we find in that moment brother god's masterpiece that's what how he looks at you when he sees you he doesn't look at failures he doesn't look at circumstances he doesn't look at the obstacles that you're going through oh he's looking at the the fullness of his heart he's looking at a people that he called out of this world he built them up by the message amen he perfected them he cut them just right amen he brought his capstone word down on them amen to restore them unto himself and now what's he doing he's just on the verge of stepping over to that garden again hallelujah he's got you he caught you're not part of this world you're part of him you're restored to a fellowship you're not a church you're the bride you're his wife you're his beloved you've got his ear you've got his favor his eye never leaves you you are the you're the fullness of his desire you're his masterpiece that's what god thinks when he looks at you what a masterpiece what a beauty what a treasure my bride that's how he thinks that's how we ought to think the great masterpiece of a family in that message masterpiece brother graham said that masterpiece is the second adam and the second eve now now now ready for the garden the millennium amen back on the earth glory hallelujah that's what it means to be shut in with god in this holy of holies it means you've left the world behind you you've gone beyond the veil and you're in that presence ready for the garden again amen hallelujah oh that's that holy of holies friends look at this now in genesis 3 said he drove out the man he placed on the east of the garden cherubims he put cherubims around the garden with a flaming sword to keep the way of the tree of life those cherubim weren't put there to keep aidan away from you they were put there to keep it safe until you came home hallelujah oh the lord said to moses speak to aaron that he come out at all times in this holy place amen into that veil which is upon the ark don't let him come in that he die not he couldn't go in there any time he wanted it was special it was sacred it was death to enter in there amen for the for the lord said i will appear in the cloud upon that mercy seat friends that shekinah presence that was there over that ark between the wings of the cherubim the literal presence of the pillar of fire god himself amen literally himself amen was swirling there between the wings of the cherubim and that was not the special privilege of that high priest that high priest was was keeping that place sacred for you then it was death to enter in now it's death to stay out now it's death to stay out what are you going to choose what are you going to choose those cherubims amen can you think it was such a sacred that that fellowship that presence that atmosphere that environment where a mere mortal would step into the presence of god and look at him look at his presence be surrounded by him that's that's a garden of eden experience amen and under those blood and bowls of goats it was restricted it was held back but god didn't want it that way god didn't put those cherubims there because he was angry amen because because he was trying to defend that presence from his people but they were put there to guard it until the appointed time amen when the veil would be torn and the by and and there became a new and living way where once it was death to enter in now paul said we go boldly into that presence the believer goes boldly in there not fearful not under condemnation not under worry will god strike me down with judgment no the way is open the way is clear there is an escape from satan's eden you just gotta step beyond the veil amen and it's not with hell from you it's his desire for you his very angels his cherubim have kept it for you they've guarded it over the centuries in millennia waiting for adam's race to come back home and now you're there friends and you got a choice in your life hey man young people you've got a choice will you look for satisfaction in satan's eden or will you go in there will you go beyond that veil brother braham said there's two spirits god of this evil age we're getting over unto god of this evil age now he said the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil spirit they're working in deception and the people of the earth are now making their choice that's what's happening right now in this evil age people are making their choice amen are we going to believe the devil's lie and try to eke out our satisfaction down here in this temporal and mortal dwelling amen or are we going to go in there the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ the spirit of god as it's grown into the full stature of god is the age that we're now living in what angel we living in it's a bride age amen it's the it's the holy ghost but not just the holy ghost that fell on azusa street but it's the spirit of god as it's grown into the full stature amen it's come up it's come up to a to a perfection amen to a masterpiece that's the age we're now living in and the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called out of this chaos and that's what i'm longing for friends oh for a power that can pull me out of this chaotic world amen of this of the cycles of this society and this culture i'm finding no satisfaction down here i want in there the man is always fresh in there amen i don't need maintenance in there i don't need to run from meeting to meeting to to get some temporary uh mana that's going to go stale on monday or tuesday amen but in there the man is always fresh in there a dried out branch can put forth fruit amen everything's different in there everything's everything's beautiful in there everything's sacred oh everything's wonderful in that presence that's my choice but notice people are making their choice what are you going to choose choose the laodicean lifestyle choose the god of disabled age or will you choose this bright age choose the fullness of the holy ghost let it have the preeminence in your life that he could bring you up into this into the fullness of the stature of god to take he wants to take you back to eden what will you choose god of this evil age the devil's unholy spirit is calling his church by the air as usual my perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning you see it coming right back to that seed time again right back to eden and here it is again everything has come full circle the whole story has come right back to the beginning amen just as it was in in eden now now it's satan's eden they're naked and they don't know it there uh uh uh uh they've got all instead of uh that original fruit they're eating a a a hybrid and a perverted fruit naturally and spiritually everything has come full circle right back to seed time right back to the same choice that eve made will you will you listen will you accept the devil's lie or will you take my word will you take his word from it amen will you take he's made you a promise friends he promised that he would put his spirit in you he would never leave you he would never forsake you you would be at all times in his presence in fellowship with him and communion with him that he would take you and they would take you not just in your soul back to an even condition but even your body would be changed and you would step over to that other side right back to the garden will you take his word for it you got a choice amen choose the tree of knowledge or choose the tree of life and that's why you're not satisfied with what this world has to offer it's that seed of god within you crying out for eden it's crying out for eden in eden see that's where god had personal fellowship with his children he walked with them he talked with them can you imagine in the cool the evening god himself would come down not speak out of the heaven not send an angel god would just step down like he did to abraham and just take a stroll with his child amen that's what an eating condition is amen no one else around it wasn't a church service the whole neighborhood wasn't invited it wasn't a community affair it was one it was a son and his father walking walking i know it's a little different this morning just just enter into this walking amen god wants to walk with you god wants to talk with you you say little me brother nathan oh he saw you before before there was an eden before there was an eden he saw you that's the only reason he let that eden fall that's the only reason he allowed adam to be cast out because way back then he was looking at you and he said i want to walk i want to walk with you amen amen i want to have a talk with you in eden there's no worry there there's no sickness there they don't wear masks there there's no politics there there's no uncertainty no unsettlement no chaos it's paradise hey man it's a place if you could if you could ever get there amen when you can walk there you might as well forget the troubles of this world it's as if in eden it's as if they don't exist it's a it's a paradise everything's perfect there there's joy there there's peace there there's no sorrow there's no tears if there are it's tears of joy in eden that's what he wants for you that's what he that's what he prepared for his bride it wasn't your idea or mine it was his and it was for you amen you know a paradise and you can live there now we know we're not in we're not in the millennium hey man we're talking about a bright age we know we're not we've listen if you think you're in if you could get up this morning and take a look in the mirror and tell me you're in the millennium and you got you got some spiritual sight or something we're not we're not there but you know where we're at we're in goshen and in goshen under that token all the plagues of egypt can't touch you the misery the depression the chaos the uncertainty those things can't touch you you've been assembled oh my into a secret place under a special mark set aside under a token you're in goshen you're not only a goshen amen you're in that holy of holies amen you're in solomon's temple you're in that place amen you're in there you're aaron you've left the the crowd behind you don't dress like them you don't talk like them you make a different noise you're under a different calling you're set aside you're a priesthood you're like aaron you step in there you step you step brush pack those triple curtains that are they're not there to keep you out there to keep the world out amen but you've got a privilege amen you can get into a place with god amen in that shekinah amen you might as well forget the rest of the world exists when you're in there there's only one person that matters and that's him and you're in there with him in that shekinah in that presence i feel just now amen in that in that look in the literal the literal presence the atmosphere of your creator your father your lover your bridegroom you're there with him and that's where the deep emotions are felt that's where poetry rolls from the soul in that place that's where dry buds come to life again manna can never go stale corruption can never enter there rot can never enter in there hallelujah you're in there you're in there today you've got a right to enter in hallelujah here we got battles but we're in the promised land we're in that oh we got milk and honey in spite of what the devil's doing we're in our promise you got joy you got peace you got security you've got rest you got happiness you got praise you got singing you got dancing why because you're in there why can't we have these things in the middle of satan's eden it's your privilege to have it this world can't take it from you the world didn't give it as the song says and the world can't take it away hallelujah because you're of another eden amen is this an encouragement to anyone now if we're of another eden what are we doing here in satan's eden what's it all about what's going on what's god's purpose in keeping us here brother brahm said god of this evil age we find that this evil age why was satan allowed to create an even in the first place or to build one pervert one why was he given why was he given reign to build this world and and to construct this society and all put all the pressures and all the torments and all the things that are in satania what's it all about brother brahms said this evil age is to prove to satan that she is not like eve that you are not like eve that's what god's doing today he's proving to the devil that this one's different hallelujah she's not that type of a woman amen this one is different hallelujah you know the god of this evil age is sitting on his throne but he's sitting up there precariously today amen lucifer the morning star has reached his zenith he's built his world he's built his eden but hell is anxious today hallelujah because satan has spent six thousand years building in eden amen and he thinks he's got away with it he thinks he won a victory when he deceived eve amen as she was cast out the garden the devil thinks that he won a victory when he deceived the early church and caused him to go into the nicean council and come under denominational darkness he thought he won the victory and just now it looks like that satan has built his eden he's built his world and he looks like he's on the verge of victory over the bride of jesus christ but we've got another message for the devil this one is different and the only reason the devil got this far to try to put his pressures on you to try to bring his darkness on you the reason he's built this eden is to prove once and for all that this one is different this eve won't fail she's not that kind of woman she doesn't play around with the word of god no she's back to an eating condition she's shut in with god she's shut off from the voice of the devil you're different you're different this one's different this one's not gonna fail oh glory to god brother braham said as god took from the body of adam the woman god has took from the body of christ amen and is bringing a bride out that won't fail by denomination or creed he said i hope that every man that hears this tape and every woman and i say let the devil pay attention i pray that every man will understand that she is the second eve but she's not breaking she'll stay with this world regardless with this word regardless of what anybody says because she's shedding with god this eve won't fail brother sister this one's different this evening will last this one

the earth and he's lifted his bride into heaven with him when she comes back on the earth again a new heavens and a new earth cold winter can't hurt it hot summers can't hurt it the deserts will blossom as a rose sin and sinners are gone god and his creation are dwelling together in perfect harmony as the heavens and the earth are husband and wife so is christ and the church and they all meet in one big glorious plan of redemption right back into the bosom of god we're going back to eden we're going back to eden hallelujah you believe that amen i do too amen i i feel it amen uh sometimes you get into a place with god it don't matter where you are you might be in your car in your shower in your chair on a walk whatever it is and it's almost like you you could feel the cool breeze of that garden and even when you least expect it sometimes he just drops by to visit you your mind goes to a scripture to a quote or to a sermon that you heard or something the lord did for you recently and all of a sudden he's right there walking with you talking with you amen that should tell you friends you're not of this world amen he's got a special interest in you this world's ready for the burning but not you you're different he wants amen my message to the church today brothers and sisters walk with god amen walk with god a man or woman who's in an even condition what they ought to do they ought to walk like adam want it brings a walk in the cool of the evening walk with god let him don't let his presence be a stranger in your home don't shut them out with the entertainments and the and the fashion and the cultures and the thought processes of this world no make it that make it a temple make it a temple for uh between the wings of the cherubim he can come in and he begins to speak lip to ear you ever young people you ever heard an old saint just just testifying to somebody say you know the lord spoke this to me the lord really showed me this the ro the lord you know i was going through this and then the lord gave me a word and it just brought comfort to my heart that's so real hey man to think of the privilege amen the creator of heavens and earth come and take a moment with you to to to show compassion to your need whatever it is and speak a word lift to ear face to face what a glorious thing you can walk like that every born-again child of god can walk with him like that you know we we often walk with the church we walk with the group we walk we walk the walk so to speak and friends i love my church but i want to walk with god i love my family but i want to walk with god amen in such a relationship that the group doesn't figure into it and if you took the group away it wouldn't matter i'm walking with god walking like abraham walked all everything everything all people kingdoms rise and fall all around me men are building empires and monuments and things like that i'm walking with god i got no i got no continuing city down here i've got no kingdoms to build i want to walk with him i don't want to miss my opportunity a moment in his presence is worth a thousand elsewhere amen i want to walk with god that's how enoch that's how enoch a type of the rapture he manifested the seed that was in him he wasn't of cane seed because he wasn't a builder he wasn't making kingdoms he wasn't carving out empires he wasn't ringing and fighting he was walking that's what adam seed do that true seed that's what they do they walk with god and adam and enoch walked and he was not because he walked with god he pleased god he didn't walk with the world he wasn't in step with his environment he walked with god i hope this resonating with somebody amen this rapture will be for the people who don't walk in satan's eden you got nothing to look for down here you won't find it down here you're not walking in satan's eating you're walking with god walk with god find that hidden life in christ don't accept a substitute till you find that hidden life in christ amen just you and god and nobody else oh yeah and you know uh adam and eve weren't destined they weren't they weren't going to be alone in the garden forever that spoken word they had a spoken word that was that's going to bring forth family it's going to be for children it's going to bring forth prosperity it's going to it's going to multiply it's going to do all those things it'll do the same thing in your life the spoken word of this message it'll give you a family it'll give your friends it'll build a good church it'll do all those things but it starts in the garden alone in the garden where art thou adam where art thou do you ever think about that he knew where adam was he was an omniscient god he knew right he knew exactly the the tree or the shrub or wherever it was that little fig tree adam was hiding behind he knew right where he was but you know he loves to hear his children answer his call so he called out adam where are you where are you adam and thank thank uh think of this moment now god comes to his garden again in the cool the evening comes down steps into a body calls out adam amen and this time he came for the last time it was the last moment before adam was to be kicked out of the garden hallelujah and just for that last time he wanted to hear his child his son his creation call out respond his call he was actually calling adam to remove him and it must have felt so final to adam god's last call of his name in the garden before he had to leave maybe he walked with him a little while said listen adam said i i'm sorry my son i know it it seems like this is our last walk in the garden i know it seems final i know it seems terrible but you know adam i'm in control of this thing i haven't i haven't lost control but you know adam there's something i got in my heart to express and that's why all this is happening the serpent seed must run its course satan's eden has got to but this isn't the end adam eden's not lost but this has to happen so that i can go call on some others i've got to go find nathan i've got to go find cheyenne you got to put them together i got to go find little rowan put your name into there amen put your name there jacob where art thou art benjamin where art thou are you amen jonathan where art thou hallelujah amen brother levi where art thou had to find you had to find you amen eden was never lost
