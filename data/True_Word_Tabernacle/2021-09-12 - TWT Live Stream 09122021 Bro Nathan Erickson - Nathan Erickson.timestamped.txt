[44:26] amen we welcome you out to the house of
[44:27] god let's go directly to the word
[44:30] and we'll just go right to the beginning
[44:32] genesis chapter one
[44:34] take our texts for the morning
[44:36] appreciate the good atmosphere we have
[44:38] we feel in the house of god
[44:40] uh quick announcement don't forget that
[44:42] couples meeting
[44:44] at the mass barn that's on saturday the
[44:46] 25th of this month at i think we said 6
[44:48] p.m somebody said uh well what counts as
[44:52] young couples and i said you're as young
[44:54] as you feel
[44:56] so but
[44:57] it'd be the second time we've done this
[44:58] brother wayne has got a real good
[45:00] uh book it's a little booklet a
[45:02] collection of quotes on marriage and
[45:04] things and
[45:06] really edifying material and so we're
[45:09] we're sort of following up on that if
[45:11] you think you would benefit from that
[45:12] keep that in mind
[45:15] amen genesis chapter one
[45:18] and verse 26
[45:27] and god said let us make man in our
[45:29] image after our likeness and let them
[45:32] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[45:35] over the fowl of the air and over the
[45:37] cattle and over all the earth and over
[45:39] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[45:41] the earth
[45:42] so god created man in his own image in
[45:45] the image of god created he him
[45:47] male and female created he them and god
[45:50] blessed them and god said unto them be
[45:52] fruitful and multiply
[45:54] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[45:57] and have dominion over the fish of the
[45:58] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[46:01] over every living thing that moveth upon
[46:03] the earth and god said behold i have
[46:05] given you
[46:06] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[46:08] the face of all the earth and every tree
[46:10] into which is the fruit of a tree
[46:11] yielding seed to you it shall be for
[46:13] meat and to every beast of the earth and
[46:16] to every fowl of the air and to
[46:17] everything that creepeth upon the earth
[46:19] wherein there is life
[46:21] i have given every green herb for meat
[46:24] and it was so and god saw everything
[46:26] that he had made and behold it was very
[46:28] good
[46:29] and the evening and the morning were the
[46:31] sixth day and over to the second chapter
[46:34] thus the heavens and the earth were
[46:35] finished
[46:36] and all the host of them
[46:39] and on the seventh day god ended his
[46:40] work which he had made and he rested on
[46:42] the seventh day from all his work which
[46:44] he had made and god blessed the seventh
[46:46] day and sanctified it because that in it
[46:48] he had rested from all his work which
[46:50] god created and made these
[46:53] are the generations of the heavens and
[46:56] of the earth when they were created in
[46:58] the day that the lord god made the earth
[47:00] in the heavens
[47:01] and every plant of the field before it
[47:03] was in the earth and every herb of the
[47:05] field before it grew
[47:06] for the lord god had not caused it to
[47:08] rain upon the earth and there was not a
[47:10] man to till the ground but there went up
[47:12] a mist from the earth and watered the
[47:13] whole face of the ground
[47:15] and the lord god formed man
[47:19] of the dust of the ground
[47:21] and breathed into his nostrils the
[47:23] breath of life and man became
[47:25] a living soul
[47:27] and the lord god planted a garden
[47:29] eastward in eden and there he put the
[47:32] man who he had formed and out of the
[47:34] ground made the lord god to grow every
