[17:26] morning he came to you a
[17:29] amen hallelujah want to go to the Lord
[17:31] in prayer this morning testimony from
[17:33] Sister Barb kovi
[17:37] says almost three years ago first
[17:39] testimony almost three years ago I got
[17:41] Co and it damaged my heart at the time I
[17:44] had an appointment already to see a
[17:45] cardiologist because my regular doctor
[17:47] thought I needed a pacemaker because my
[17:49] heartbeat was so low before the
[17:51] appointment came up I got Co and it
[17:53] threw me into a fib with my heart
[17:55] beating over 120 at times and for long
[17:58] periods the cardiologist implanted a
[18:01] link recorder in my chest which is like
[18:03] an EKG going
[18:05] 24/7 after watching that for several
[18:07] months he said I needed a heart oblation
[18:09] which I had a year ago at first it
[18:12] seemed to work but later the aib started
[18:14] back I had another appointment to go to
[18:16] the cardiologist but at the Fall
[18:19] Festival some of the sisters felt led to
[18:21] lay hands on me and prayed for my heart
[18:24] the next week I went in for the
[18:26] appointment and he looked at the report
[18:27] for the prior month
[18:29] and told me I had had 27 episodes that
[18:32] month of aib this month when I got the
[18:35] report it showed zero episodes I have
[18:38] never had a zero episode in any month
[18:41] since I had to recorder implanted I
[18:43] thank the Lord for his touch and for my
[18:45] sisters being led to pray for me second
[18:48] testimony I've had a chronic cough for
[18:50] over two years and in the spring I ended
[18:52] up with double pneumonia and was
[18:54] hospitalized for 4 days and was given a
[18:56] lot of different antibiotics through IV
[18:59] while I was there the X-ray at that time
[19:02] showed infection in both lungs it took a
[19:04] while but I did start to feel better and
[19:07] my doctor told me to get a new x-ray in
[19:09] about 4 months to make sure my lungs
[19:10] were clear they were they were not but
[19:14] it showed it was only in the left lung
[19:17] so she sent me to a pulmonary specialist
[19:20] and he did an x-ray and by that time it
[19:22] was down to the lower part of the lung
[19:25] he sent me to get a CT scan because he
[19:27] said he thought I had some kind kind of
[19:29] lung disease the CT scan still showed
[19:32] something in the left lower so we are
[19:34] watching that and the CT will be
[19:35] repeated in
[19:37] January CT scans show a lot of other
[19:39] things and it showed I had a very
[19:41] enlarged spleen and curosis of the liver
[19:43] that came as a huge surprise sister
[19:46] Linda and sister Gail and Brandon my
[19:48] grandson all told me the same thing to
[19:51] do naturally so I started doing that and
[19:53] three weeks ago I came up for prayer and
[19:54] brother Wayne and brother Ray and others
[19:56] prayed for me and the next day I noticed
[19:58] this huge differences in how I felt my
[20:01] energy level was up the brain fog which
[20:03] was terrible was gone the exhaustion was
[20:06] gone all the things I thought was coming
[20:08] from my heart could actually have been
[20:09] the liver I did not realize it caused
[20:12] all that but I have had the best three
[20:14] weeks of my life in the last three years
[20:17] I know I received a touch from the Lord
[20:19] I honestly feel like a whole new person
[20:22] I have to see the liver doctor tomorrow

[59:17] Revelations chapter 5 and verse one and
[59:20] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[59:22] on the throne a book written within and
[59:24] on the backside seal
[59:26] with Seven Seals and I saw a strong
[59:28] Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is
[59:32] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[59:34] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[59:37] on Earth neither under the Earth was
[59:38] able to open the book neither to look
[59:40] there on and I wept much because no man
[59:43] was found worthy to open and to read the
[59:47] book neither to look their on and one of
[59:49] the elders said unto me weep not and
[59:51] that's where I'd like to speak from this
[59:53] this morning weep not behold the the
[59:56] lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[59:58] the David hath prevailed to open the
[1:00:00] book and the loose of Seven Seals
[1:00:03] thereof and I beheld and low in the
[1:00:04] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:00:06] beasts in the midst of the elders stood
[1:00:08] a lamb as it had been slain having seven
[1:00:11] horns seven eyes which are the seven
[1:00:13] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[1:00:15] Earth and he came and took the book out
[1:00:17] of the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:00:19] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:00:21] The Four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders fell
[1:00:23] down before the lamb having ever one of
[1:00:26] them Harps and golden vials full of
[1:00:28] odors which are the prayers of the
[1:00:30] Saints and they sung a new song saying
[1:00:33] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and
[1:00:35] they open the seals thereof for thou H
[1:00:37] has thou was slain and has redeemed us
[1:00:40] to God by thy Blood Out out of every
[1:00:42] Kindred tongue people and nation and has
[1:00:45] made us under our God Kings and Priests
[1:00:47] and we shall reign on the earth and I
[1:00:50] beheld and have heard the voice of many
[1:00:52] angels round about the throne and the
[1:00:54] beasts and the elders ERS and the number
[1:00:57] of them was 10,000 time 10,000 and
[1:01:00] thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:01:02] loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was
[1:01:04] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:01:06] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[1:01:09] and blessing and every creature which is
[1:01:11] in heaven and on Earth and under the
[1:01:13] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[1:01:16] that are in them heard I say so it went
[1:01:20] from weeping to a
[1:01:22] shout heard I saying blessing and honor
[1:01:25] honor and glory and power be unto him
[1:01:28] that sth upon the throne and unto the
[1:01:31] lamb forever and ever and the four be
[1:01:33] said a man and the 4 and 20 Elders fell
[1:01:36] down and worshiped him that liveth
[1:01:38] forever and ever amen amen God bless you
[1:01:42] this morning you can have your
[1:01:45] seats amen just like to say again I'd
[1:01:49] like to speak on weep not and I was
[1:01:51] looking at this thought and and and
[1:01:54] preached it at home here
[1:01:56] uh couple a week or so ago and Lord just
[1:01:59] been dealing with me on it for this
[1:02:01] morning and I was looking what brother
[1:02:03] Brandon was speaking about he said it
[1:02:04] was a strong Angel a strong angel with a
[1:02:08] loud voice so it wasn't a norm you know
[1:02:11] just a normal voice or a as you may
[1:02:14] speak normally to one another but it was
[1:02:16] a strong voice a loud voice proclaiming
[1:02:19] who is worthy worthy for what who is
[1:02:22] worthy to take the book and I I got to
[1:02:24] looking in that word strong and that
[1:02:26] strong means one of great strength a
[1:02:30] warrior or an authority a master of
[1:02:33] authority he's strong he's Mighty and I
[1:02:36] and I I read in one Psalms 103 and we'll
[1:02:38] go through a few scriptures just quote
[1:02:39] them for a minute it says bless the Lord
[1:02:41] ye his angels that excel in strength
[1:02:46] they excel in strength and do his
[1:02:48] Commandments and hearkens hearken to the
[1:02:50] voice of the word we can also read in
[1:02:52] Revelations 10:1 it it expresses a
[1:02:55] mighty angel this is a forceable
[1:02:57] powerful strong Valiant Angel amen so he
[1:03:01] would as he would as the prophecy of his
[1:03:04] of this lamb coming Isaiah would pick it
[1:03:06] up and he would say for us unto us a
[1:03:08] child is born unto us a son is given the
[1:03:11] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:03:13] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:03:15] and counselor the Mighty God the Mighty
[1:03:18] God the Everlasting father the Mighty
[1:03:20] God is one of great strength or
[1:03:23] authority or great that is able to
[1:03:26] Prevail or in other words he's
[1:03:27] successful in his strength and in his
[1:03:30] his authority so a God that is mighty a
[1:03:33] god that is mighty in battle he's he's
[1:03:36] mighty to save a God we sering a god
[1:03:38] who's not afraid of conflict amen he's
[1:03:42] not afraid to face his enemies he's not
[1:03:45] afraid to come to your Aid when you have
[1:03:47] need of him so we're not in the hands of
[1:03:49] someone who's incapable of handling what
[1:03:52] we're going through or what life may
[1:03:54] throw at us amen he's not surprised what
[1:03:57] you're going through this morning he
[1:03:59] already saw it coming before you ever
[1:04:01] got there and he already has the answer
[1:04:03] for you Amen in your situation so he is
[1:04:06] in control he has always been in control
[1:04:08] and he will always be in control Amen in
[1:04:12] Zephaniah verse chapter 3 it says the
[1:04:14] Lord your God he is in your midst and
[1:04:17] he's a mighty one who will save amen
[1:04:20] he's a mighty one who was saved
[1:04:22] Deuteronomy talks about him and says the
[1:04:24] Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of
[1:04:27] lords he's the great the Mighty the
[1:04:30] awesome God who's not partial and takes
[1:04:33] no bribes I love that so there's no deal
[1:04:36] the devil can make with him over your
[1:04:38] soul amen he's not going to take a bribe
[1:04:40] there's not enough money that can buy
[1:04:42] you but he gave the most precious price
[1:04:45] for you when he gave his life for you
[1:04:47] amen and he's not here to trade he's not
[1:04:49] here to make a deal but he's going to
[1:04:51] take what is his off the face of this
[1:04:53] Earth in a Rapture in a body change amen
[1:04:56] so he's not come to this moment in the
[1:04:58] time that we're living in and all the
[1:05:00] chaos that's around us and thinking how
[1:05:03] am I going to do this how that's going
[1:05:04] to happen no all that is happening upon
[1:05:07] the face of this Earth is pre-planned by
[1:05:10] almighty God what you're going through
[1:05:12] is pre praying by almighty God God saw
[1:05:15] it God knows about it and he's there for
[1:05:17] you in your trial he's there for you in
[1:05:20] your tears he's there for you in your
[1:05:22] trouble this God is not going to leave
[1:05:24] you he's not going to forsake you he's
[1:05:27] not going to walk away when the time

[1:07:16] hard for
[1:07:17] you buddy I've gained a lot of strength
[1:07:20] from that scripture right there nothing
[1:07:22] is too hard for him amen nothing what
[1:07:26] what about my sickness nothing what
[1:07:28] about my children nothing nothing is too
[1:07:31] hard for you job nine says he is a wise

[1:07:47] Lord and you are exalted as head above
[1:07:50] it
[1:07:52] all but here John is found in the he's
[1:07:56] found weeping even after he hears this
[1:07:58] strong Angel he's found weeping and why
[1:08:02] because a book had been lost it went
[1:08:04] back to the original owner it had been
[1:08:06] forfeited by the by a son the first Son
[1:08:08] of God the human race and he forfeit his
[1:08:11] rights to Listen by listening to Satan
[1:08:14] he give it up what did he do he accepted
[1:08:16] Satan's wisdom instead of God's
[1:08:20] word come on Amen sons of God that'll
[1:08:23] take a seminary idea about it instead of
[1:08:26] the word of God same thing Adam did
[1:08:28] you'll forfeit your
[1:08:31] right amen you take psychology over the
[1:08:34] word of God you'll forfeit your rights
[1:08:37] if you take a man's idea or intellectual
[1:08:39] opinions you'll forfeit your rights but
[1:08:42] if you'll stay with the word of God
[1:08:44] you'll still have every right that
[1:08:45] belongs to
[1:08:47] you what did he do it went straight back
[1:08:50] as a quote can you see where those ages
[1:08:52] have been went straight back to the
[1:08:54] original holder and John in the
[1:08:57] spirit amen standing up here in heaven
[1:09:00] he' just been lifted up now from the
[1:09:02] church ages saw the church Jes and when
[1:09:05] he was taken up in the fourth chapter he
[1:09:06] said come up higher I'm going to show
[1:09:09] you things that will come amen this is
[1:09:11] what he said in Revelations chapter one
[1:09:13] I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:09:16] Day come on somebody and I heard behind
[1:09:19] me a a little voice no a great voice and
[1:09:23] a trumpet he said brother R said I was
[1:09:25] in the spirit he said isn't that
[1:09:29] beautiful amen let me tell you it wasn't
[1:09:31] by accident brother Ben talked about
[1:09:32] Ohio State in Michigan okay I was in the
[1:09:36] spirit my I love that you could just
[1:09:40] call those words the whole of Christian
[1:09:44] Life I love that in other words all
[1:09:48] every day of your life you ought to be
[1:09:50] caught up in the
[1:09:52] spirit amen the whole of Christian Life
[1:09:55] if we're going to live as Christians we
[1:09:57] have to be in a spirit John was not
[1:09:59] talking about his own spirit that would
[1:10:01] have not brought brought Visions it had
[1:10:03] to be the spirit of God it has to be the
[1:10:06] spirit of God with us too or all our
[1:10:08] efforts are in
[1:10:10] vain you can build the biggest church
[1:10:12] you want to if it's all about a man it's
[1:10:14] all in vain but if God be there and I
[1:10:17] say he is here this
[1:10:21] morning Paul said I will pray in the
[1:10:24] spirit I'll sing in the spirit I'll live
[1:10:25] in The Spirit Well if that was good
[1:10:27] enough for Paul it's good enough for
[1:10:30] me amen if there's anything good that
[1:10:33] will come to me it has to be revealed by
[1:10:36] the spirit confirmed by the word and
[1:10:38] made manifest by the results it bears as
[1:10:41] surely as John needed to be in the
[1:10:43] spirit to receive those tremendous
[1:10:45] Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to
[1:10:47] be in the spirit to understand the
[1:10:50] revelations that God has given us to
[1:10:52] live by his word for it is the same
[1:10:56] spirit and he goes on he said look at it
[1:10:58] this way all too many read the Bible
[1:11:01] where it said in Acts
[1:11:03] 238 repent be baptized every one of you
[1:11:06] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:11:08] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:11:10] the Holy Ghost and they go right on he
[1:11:12] said they don't see it if they saw it by
[1:11:15] getting the spirit they would know they
[1:11:17] want to receive the Holy Spirit they
[1:11:19] would know they need to
[1:11:21] repent they would know they would need
[1:11:23] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:11:24] Jesus and then God would be Duty bound
[1:11:27] to fulfill his word by giving him the
[1:11:29] Holy
[1:11:33] Ghost
[1:11:37] amen they never get in the spirit or it
[1:11:40] would happen to them exactly as the word
[1:11:42] says pray to God for a revelation by his
[1:11:46] spirit amen that's the first step get in
[1:11:48] the spirit let me just another
[1:11:50] illustration suppose you need healing
[1:11:52] what does the word say well we have to
[1:11:54] read it count Countess time but did it
[1:11:56] not get in the but did not get in the
[1:11:58] spirit when reading
[1:12:01] it hello we've read by his stripes are
[1:12:04] healed but get in the spirit
[1:12:07] first amen did you he said did you ask
[1:12:10] God for his Spirit to teach you the real
[1:12:12] truth of it if we did we'd call the
[1:12:14] Elders we'd confess our sins we'd be
[1:12:17] anointed we'd be prayed for and that
[1:12:19] would be
[1:12:22] that Hallelujah it might not come
[1:12:25] immediately but in his spirit it's all
[1:12:29] over there's no other court of appeal
[1:12:32] God will fulfill his word we need to get
[1:12:34] in the spirit then those things will be
[1:12:37] done that's right don't go through the
[1:12:40] acts first get in the spirit and then go
[1:12:42] through the
[1:12:45] acts come on Hallelujah you know
[1:12:48] sometimes we I'm a song leader so
[1:12:50] sometimes we depend on the song leader
[1:12:52] and that's fine he needs to he needs to
[1:12:54] get in the spirit
[1:12:57] and and you're blessed by a wonderful
[1:12:59] song leader brother Ben I watch him and
[1:13:01] I see amen God move upon his life and
[1:13:03] all a sudden he'll sing this song why
[1:13:05] because he's in the spirit and it'll
[1:13:07] move over here and it'll move over there
[1:13:09] things he don't even know going on and
[1:13:11] and a certain song will come and it'll
[1:13:13] break bonds off of people's lives why
[1:13:15] because he was in the spirit but listen
[1:13:17] don't leave that all on the song
[1:13:20] leader don't leave that all in a
[1:13:22] preacher amen every one of us need to
[1:13:24] come to House of God and say God I want
[1:13:27] to be in the spirit I want to see you
[1:13:30] move I've been moaning I've been
[1:13:33] groaning I've been complaining I've been
[1:13:35] all of this but let it cease and let me
[1:13:37] see your spirit in my
[1:13:40] life then it won't be a song leader
[1:13:42] trying to lift you up you'll be
[1:13:45] up you'll be
[1:13:49] ready I love it like there some some
[1:13:51] Services you can come to as a song
[1:13:53] leader and you can come first song

[1:14:02] spirit the pre-service music started
[1:14:05] playing one started reading the Bible
[1:14:07] one started praying next thing you know

[1:14:14] atmosphere amen that's the atmosphere
[1:14:17] that's what we're looking for get in the
[1:14:19] spirit then go through acts and watch
[1:14:21] what God to do then it stops and he
[1:14:23] brings it down to some maybe we can

[1:19:03] Lord the Christian now listen to this
[1:19:06] statement right
[1:19:10] here the Christian ought to be just as
[1:19:13] exuberant and full of his pleasure in

[1:19:18] saviors and delights in its
[1:19:22] Pleasures wow

[1:19:46] lost come
[1:19:48] on just going to say it y'all had tears
[1:19:50] for a few years
[1:19:52] yourself why because you lost
[1:19:55] and this is what John is looking at he's
[1:19:58] looking at
[1:19:59] losing and this is why he's weeping cuz
[1:20:02] he sees that there's no one worthy to
[1:20:04] take the book but a voice
[1:20:07] speaks don't worry about it weep not
[1:20:09] John you're not going to
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:13] lose could you imagine being on a team
[1:20:16] that cannot
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:20] lose Hallelujah you can walk through
[1:20:23] cancer and you won't lose you walk
[1:20:25] through every kind of hell and you won't
[1:20:27] lose you walk through death and you
[1:20:30] won't
[1:20:31] lose you can not
[1:20:35] lose so this is not the time for weeping
[1:20:39] this is a time for
[1:20:41] rejoicing cuz we have a lamb that has
[1:20:48] prevailed John got in the spirit to see
[1:20:50] those things there he was in his time
[1:20:53] and his flesh
[1:20:56] you're just getting in the flesh well of
[1:20:57] course I'm in my
[1:21:00] flesh what are you but I'm
[1:21:03] also there's some on the inside of me
[1:21:06] that's been called into another
[1:21:09] realm and I'm looking at things that
[1:21:11] cannot be
[1:21:15] seen John couldn't see what he saw with
[1:21:17] his natural eyes he had to be caught
[1:21:19] into a place to be able to see things
[1:21:21] that could not be seen with these eyes
[1:21:23] if you look with these eyes right now
[1:21:25] you say oh brother so and so he got this
[1:21:26] fault s so and so she said this about me
[1:21:29] this is over here but if you'll just get
[1:21:30] the moving into the Realms of the spirit
[1:21:34] lifting
[1:21:36] up then you won't see all that
[1:21:41] negativity can I just say it like this I
[1:21:43] I'm not trying to meddle but I'm just
[1:21:44] going as I feel L I know in a building
[1:21:47] project there gets to be a lot of
[1:21:48] negativity flying around it's best not
[1:21:51] to even dwell on that negativity it's
[1:21:53] best to stay focused on what God has
[1:21:55] called us to
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:21:58] do amen it's best to stay in that
[1:22:01] channel in that channel and behind the
[1:22:03] leadership and say whatever amen they
[1:22:05] might not pick out my favorite carpet
[1:22:07] they not might not pick out my f but it
[1:22:09] ain't got nothing to do with what color
[1:22:11] the carpet is or what color the pain is
[1:22:13] it has to do with the spirit of God is
[1:22:15] here that's where the Liberty is and
[1:22:17] that's where I want to be
[1:22:27] amen I was kind of the overseer general
[1:22:31] contractor they wanted to call me
[1:22:32] whatever of our building project because
[1:22:34] I was able to be there when other
[1:22:36] brothers had full-time jobs I was able
[1:22:38] to meet the Subs and Such
[1:22:41] and brother Wayne came and rode many
[1:22:44] hours on a bulldozzer
[1:22:46] really appreciate him and thank him for
[1:22:50] that you know and I may have told this
[1:22:52] before but I tell it again one of the
[1:22:54] hardest things in our whole
[1:22:56] deal our whole building project was the
[1:23:06] sound there's two things that can't
[1:23:08] hardly get right it's AC and heat and
[1:23:10] sound people get tore up from the floor
[1:23:12] up about it just
[1:23:15] mad and this is what happened we we got
[1:23:17] we actually got bows to come and and and
[1:23:21] they took every measurement in our
[1:23:22] building all the little bump outs like
[1:23:24] that how far the wall went every Pew
[1:23:26] everything I mean they had a detailed
[1:23:28] map of our thing and they made speakers
[1:23:31] that would sit right there at certain
[1:23:32] places and they send us back a blueprint
[1:23:34] said you hang them this far apart this
[1:23:37] far off this wall that far off this wall
[1:23:38] this high and this pitch wow well some
[1:23:42] of the brothers that were in The Sound
[1:23:43] thought this is crazy that looks stupid
[1:23:45] that that ain't going to
[1:23:47] work and I said look Bose didn't get to
[1:23:51] being Bose by being a bunch of idiots
[1:23:57] they told us where to put them I'm going
[1:23:58] to put them where they said put them you
[1:24:01] can get mading do whatever you want to
[1:24:03] but when they come here if they don't
[1:24:04] work they come here it ain't going to be
[1:24:06] C I moved them in the middle or I did
[1:24:08] something different they going to be
[1:24:09] according to the
[1:24:10] blueprint so that was a heel I was
[1:24:12] willing to die on and I just about died
[1:24:15] on
[1:24:18] it so we hung them with both said and we
[1:24:21] plugged it in worst sound
[1:24:25] ever terrible we went we had our
[1:24:28] dedication meeting brother Wayne was
[1:24:29] there worst sound ever
[1:24:32] terrible I told you them speakers need
[1:24:34] to be over here and I told you that and
[1:24:37] I'm just like
[1:24:38] Lord what do we do so brother Michael
[1:24:41] calls Bose and he's telling them about
[1:24:42] it and they sent their engineer the one
[1:24:44] who designed our our build they sent him
[1:24:47] from the West Coast flew him right into
[1:24:48] streetport rented a car met us at our
[1:24:50] church with our sound texts and
[1:24:52] different ones and he walked up this
[1:24:54] aisle and we got a mezzan he walks up
[1:24:56] that mezzan turns on a certain sound
[1:24:58] kind of like a white noise but it's a
[1:24:59] little different I think so he could he
[1:25:02] could hear everything should be the same
[1:25:03] no matter where he walked and there was
[1:25:05] a few areas like in the center was
[1:25:07] supposed to be a little lighter
[1:25:08] according to their measurements and
[1:25:09] things but man you could sit over here
[1:25:11] and get your ear your eard drums blowed
[1:25:13] out and be two seats over and you
[1:25:14] couldn't hear nothing wow that's the way
[1:25:16] it was and so he walks up that aisle and
[1:25:19] he comes back he walks up that aisle and
[1:25:21] he comes back and he stops he said I'll
[1:25:23] bet every every dollar I got the wires
[1:25:26] are
[1:25:28] wrong our sound technicians wired
[1:25:35] it I said oh really wires wrong what do
[1:25:38] you mean he said on your amps he said
[1:25:40] Bose is different he said most of them
[1:25:42] is like positive negative positive
[1:25:44] negative he said but Bose is positive
[1:25:46] negative negative positive or something
[1:25:47] like
[1:25:48] that and he said so two of them wires
[1:25:50] are swapped I'll bet every dollar said
[1:25:51] you give me 10 a screwdriver in 10
[1:25:53] minutes I'll fix this say wow said well
[1:25:56] let me find a
[1:25:58] screwdriver I got a screwdriver 10
[1:26:00] minutes later he said all right set
[1:26:02] everything back to factory settings now
[1:26:04] turn it on and sound filled the
[1:26:07] room most beautiful
[1:26:11] sound I could have rubbed a lot of
[1:26:14] things in but
[1:26:19] I I just kind of looked around and
[1:26:22] people in GL she us looked you know but
[1:26:24] I got to thinking about
[1:26:26] that God wants us to be filled amen with
[1:26:30] a certain
[1:26:31] sound but Satan will come along in our
[1:26:33] lives and he'll wire change up a few
[1:26:35] wires
[1:26:36] somewhere it's what he loves to do with
[1:26:38] his message he loves to change a few
[1:26:40] things just get a couple wires and all
[1:26:42] of a sudden somebody over here is
[1:26:43] hearing this somebody over here is
[1:26:44] hearing that and all kind of confusion
[1:26:46] is going on but if the master can
[1:26:49] come and he can take the tool of his
[1:26:51] word and go in there and just put it
[1:26:54] back where it needs to be then it can
[1:26:56] fill up
[1:26:58] again Hallelujah maybe this morning this
[1:27:02] Satan has come and he's changed a few
[1:27:04] things in your life and you got the wowy
[1:27:06] wowy Woos and you got all kind of things
[1:27:09] hanging on you and you don't know how
[1:27:10] you're going to make it you don't know
[1:27:12] how it's going to happen all it takes is
[1:27:14] just a few minutes in the presence of
[1:27:16] the
[1:27:17] master and he'll change your weeping
[1:27:19] into Joy
[1:27:26] you got to get into the spirit of
[1:27:30] it he said both Christians and the world
[1:27:34] are humans both have
[1:27:37] emotions the difference is the
[1:27:40] Christian's heart and emotions are
[1:27:42] purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love
[1:27:46] while the world is satisfied with the
[1:27:49] flesh but John got in the spirit here
[1:27:52] the book of r Redemption The Plan of
[1:27:55] Redemption the only way you'll ever be
[1:27:57] redeemed was there a title deed to the
[1:27:59] Redemption All of all whole heavens and
[1:28:01] earth it said let him come forward if
[1:28:04] you will brother Bram said Oh my he said
[1:28:06] now speak or forever hold his peace let
[1:28:08] him come forward and claim this book who
[1:28:11] is worthy to do it and John said there
[1:28:13] was no man in heaven that was found
[1:28:15] worthy no man on Earth that was found
[1:28:16] worthy no man that was under the Earth
[1:28:18] died was found worthy no man was found
[1:28:21] worthy there wasn't a pope there wasn't
[1:28:22] a preacher there wasn't a prophet there
[1:28:24] wasn't an angel there wasn't
[1:28:27] nothing but he asked that there be a
[1:28:29] kinsman redeemer step
[1:28:32] forth one that was near us one that
[1:28:34] could feel the pain of
[1:28:37] humanity and yet
[1:28:39] overcome one that could go through
[1:28:41] trials Family Leave Him Church
[1:28:46] splits all kind of things he was tempted
[1:28:48] in all things and yet overcome
[1:28:54] he asked for a kinsman redeemer but no
[1:28:56] man was no angel no seram they they
[1:28:58] hadn't sinned but they were a different
[1:28:59] category they never fallen but they had
[1:29:01] to be kinsman redeemer and he took a
[1:29:03] human a k human Kinsman and he asked for
[1:29:06] it and it wasn't found nowhere nobody no
[1:29:09] Bishop no Archbishop no Priest No
[1:29:11] hierarchy
[1:29:13] my and John
[1:29:16] wept and he said here's what I think he
[1:29:18] wept for because if no one was found
[1:29:20] worthy that could open this book the
[1:29:23] whole creation was
[1:29:27] lost here is the book here is the little
[1:29:29] title deed it'll be offered to the
[1:29:31] kinsman redeemer that might can that can
[1:29:33] meet the qualifications that's God's Own
[1:29:36] law he can't defile his law defy his law
[1:29:38] rather God's required a kinsman redeemer
[1:29:41] who was worthy and John looked he looked
[1:29:43] over the Earth he looked beneath the
[1:29:44] Earth and there was nobody and he
[1:29:46] started crying and he wept cuz he
[1:29:49] thought everything was lost yeah but I
[1:29:53] love this next statement he says but his
[1:29:56] crying didn't last but just a
[1:30:02] minute oh yeah his crying did not last
[1:30:05] but just a minute there one stood one of
[1:30:07] the elders says don't weep John his
[1:30:09] crying did not last but just a minute I
[1:30:12] looked into that for a moment Psalms 30
[1:30:14] says Sing unto the Lord oh you Saints of
[1:30:17] his and give thanks to the remembrance
[1:30:19] of his Holiness for his anger endureth
[1:30:21] for a moment and his favor his life
[1:30:24] weeping may endure for a
[1:30:26] night but joy cometh in the
[1:30:30] morning I got to look at that weep it
[1:30:32] means to be Tangled or confused or or
[1:30:35] lost in a place of uncertainty that
[1:30:37] brings you to
[1:30:41] tears how many's ever been
[1:30:44] there uncertain don't know what's about
[1:30:48] to take place in your life don't know
[1:30:49] where you're about to turn to don't know
[1:30:51] what's the next turn don't know what's
[1:30:52] going on and
[1:30:58] oh
[1:31:00] yeah one
[1:31:02] time there had been an excuse that you
[1:31:05] could live in depression or fear at one
[1:31:08] time there was an excuse you could live
[1:31:10] in those situations but that ain't that
[1:31:13] there ain't time for that no
[1:31:15] more one day all hope seem lost but
[1:31:19] that's not
[1:31:21] today today there is a Door of Hope
[1:31:25] what are you saying I'm saying as a
[1:31:27] prophet declared the Sun is
[1:31:31] up it's not Darkness to you
[1:31:34] anymore the sun is shining amen we don't
[1:31:37] have to be all bent over and sad and
[1:31:39] worried and depressed and threatened
[1:31:41] about all this is going to happen the
[1:31:43] Sun is
[1:31:50] up you know like the old slaves back
[1:31:53] when they Emancipation Proclamation came
[1:31:55] forth they were abound but on a certain
[1:31:59] day yeah they were going to be free and
[1:32:02] the time they was going to be free was
[1:32:04] when the sun come up we know what they
[1:32:05] did the women and children little ones
[1:32:07] the cripples all the way down strung up
[1:32:09] down the hillside because as soon as the
[1:32:11] sun come up they were free at the
[1:32:13] morning of the Sun but that morning as
[1:32:15] soon as they could they were going to be
[1:32:16] free well most the most strongest he
[1:32:19] said like the strongest Christians today
[1:32:21] they climb Plum to the top of the hill
[1:32:23] and they watched the first peep of the
[1:32:25] sun amen the first little peep amen and
[1:32:30] the one at the top of the hill when he
[1:32:32] sees it he screams out we're
[1:32:35] free why because the Sun is
[1:32:39] up he hollered down the next one the
[1:32:41] next one hollered to the next one all
[1:32:43] the way down if they could get the
[1:32:45] pressure off we're
[1:32:46] free why are you free the son is up and
[1:32:49] he said that was the Su you in but today
[1:32:53] he said let me
[1:32:56] scream the Sun is up the eso in the even
[1:33:01] light is shining the Holy Ghost is here
[1:33:03] the Son of God is riging in the hearts
[1:33:05] of his people the son is up I'm so glad
[1:33:09] see the same things take place that did
[1:33:11] when he was here 2,000 years ago it's
[1:33:13] happening again we can just let off the
[1:33:15] pressure cuz he's up from the
[1:33:17] grave he's up from the dead he's been
[1:33:20] raised 2,000 years and we're living with
[1:33:23] him resurrect Ed together sitting in
[1:33:25] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:33:33] Jesus so what's the use of having that
[1:33:37] pressure on
[1:33:41] you excuse me what's the use of having
[1:33:44] that pressure on
[1:33:47] you you're allowed it to overcome your
[1:33:49] thinking and you're allowed it to
[1:33:50] overcome your thoughts and you're
[1:33:51] allowed it to overcome every breathing
[1:33:56] moment people get so depressed so
[1:34:00] down but if we can just turn our eyes
[1:34:02] like John
[1:34:05] did look from no one
[1:34:08] worthy to a lion that's prevailed a
[1:34:14] lamb here he
[1:34:17] was he said an old old Eagle can just
[1:34:20] scream as much as he want to because
[1:34:21] every shackles now off him all the crust
[1:34:24] is gone he said when the worldly crust
[1:34:26] the worldly habits all the fuss and
[1:34:27] tempers and stews and all the carrying
[1:34:29] on running from denomination to
[1:34:31] denominations all settled you're in
[1:34:32] Christ Jesus you know eternal life
[1:34:34] dwells where you look back and you see
[1:34:36] where you come from back down there out
[1:34:38] of all that muck and fuss and down there
[1:34:40] he said I'm up here safe Forever More in
[1:34:42] Christ Jesus now a new creat a creature
[1:34:46] so I don't have to weep no
[1:34:51] more but the devil like to come
[1:34:54] especially in these times that we're
[1:34:55] living in and put a gloomy atmosphere
[1:34:57] over
[1:34:59] us cloudy all the time around us and we
[1:35:02] can't see nothing good and we can't see
[1:35:04] nothing happening we can't see amen but
[1:35:06] I'm here to ask you one more time look
[1:35:08] to the
[1:35:09] lamb look away from your troubles look
[1:35:12] away from your situation look away from
[1:35:14] things you can't do nothing about if you
[1:35:16] wanted
[1:35:18] to people get all tore up about politics
[1:35:22] listen all that's all on the
[1:35:23] orchestration of
[1:35:27] God I tell you what's going to happen
[1:35:29] people you know uh it was expecting Cala
[1:35:32] to be president and now she's
[1:35:34] not but let me tell you how Visions
[1:35:37] work it can be fulfilled and you not
[1:35:41] even know
[1:35:44] it all I've I've seen a woman already in
[1:35:47] a purple dress I saw it I I don't I I
[1:35:50] don't know what you want to do with it
[1:35:51] but I saw it in a purple and and they
[1:35:54] described it as royal purple and you
[1:35:56] know why she said sheward for the for
[1:35:58] the liberation of
[1:36:00] women as a sign of the liberation of
[1:36:03] women that a woman could rise to a power
[1:36:06] such as
[1:36:09] this but now Trump's in power well we
[1:36:12] got four more years you don't know if we
[1:36:14] got four more days you don't know if we
[1:36:16] got four more
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:19] hours there's going to be a lot of
[1:36:20] people in the Rapture happen they're
[1:36:22] going to say I thought it was supposed
[1:36:24] to rise in power it can happen like
[1:36:27] that it happened before in Jesus's day I
[1:36:31] thought a prophet was supposed to come
[1:36:33] before and he already did but he didn't
[1:36:35] come according to their
[1:36:37] thinking he came walking out of the
[1:36:39] desert in a skin of a clothes clothes of
[1:36:42] skin and eating a eating a bug and
[1:36:44] drinking some
[1:36:45] hotting and screaming
[1:36:50] repent like man this is a lunatic
[1:36:53] who's this guy think he is he's he done
[1:36:56] lost his mind he been out to the Sund
[1:36:58] them baked him too long the whole time
[1:37:01] it was the prophecy being
[1:37:03] fulfilled and then all of a sudden they
[1:37:05] see a man carrying a
[1:37:07] cross and he's carrying it up a hill
[1:37:10] Amen to Calvary and they're calling be
[1:37:12] Els above they call him a devil they
[1:37:14] call him a illegitimate child they call
[1:37:16] him all kinds of things and the whole
[1:37:19] time prophecy's been fulfilled
[1:37:24] I'm not sure how it's all going to
[1:37:25] happen I just know it's going to
[1:37:27] happen and as I told my church our
[1:37:30] church at home I said look don't relax
[1:37:32] just because Trump's in
[1:37:38] president no what you got to do is be
[1:37:43] ready I just want to be ready I don't
[1:37:47] care who's in president I just want to
[1:37:49] be ready to
[1:37:51] go doesn't matter What's happen around
[1:37:53] me I just want to be
[1:38:00] ready but he comes and he tries to put
[1:38:02] this gloominess I've seen him try to put
[1:38:04] it on individuals and and then on
[1:38:08] churches sit Gloom down this Gloomy
[1:38:11] atmosphere you know the world was like
[1:38:13] that one time the world was without form
[1:38:14] without void and it had a gloomy
[1:38:17] atmosphere and the way God broke that he
[1:38:21] said the spirit of God began to move and
[1:38:25] a voice spoke and said let there be
[1:38:27] light so right at the beginning in
[1:38:29] Genesis 1 he's showing us the spirit has
[1:38:32] to go with the word
[1:38:34] that's amen right there at the beginning
[1:38:37] the spirit of God moved Let There Be
[1:38:40] that's right amen and here it was this
[1:38:43] Gloomy atmosphere but a light began to
[1:38:45] shine and it began to pull back the
[1:38:48] darkness let me let me I mean I know you
[1:38:51] understand this but there ain't enough
[1:38:53] Darkness to hold back a little a little
[1:38:56] bit of
[1:38:57] light the smallest light can push back
[1:39:00] the greatest Darkness amen so the sun
[1:39:03] begin to drve begin to pull and it begin
[1:39:05] to dry out the atmospheres and begin to
[1:39:07] push the gloominous back he said why did
[1:39:09] he do that he said because down beyond
[1:39:12] all that
[1:39:15] gloominess down beyond all that void and
[1:39:18] that nothingness and the Gloom that was
[1:39:21] around there down beyond all of that
[1:39:23] laying in that Earth were
[1:39:26] seeds and he knew it had to take the son
[1:39:29] to bring forth the
[1:39:32] seed and here he is pulling that seed
[1:39:35] out of the ground and let me say this
[1:39:37] there wasn't enough muck there wasn't
[1:39:39] enough mud if that seed was ordained to
[1:39:41] life it was going to come to
[1:39:45] life I'll say it in this time if you got
[1:39:47] gloominess over you and you got doubt
[1:39:50] and confusion over you if there's a SE
[1:39:52] Gene of God on the inside the Sun is
[1:39:57] up there ain't enough the devil can put
[1:40:00] over you they ain't enough sin there
[1:40:02] ain't enough doubt there ain't enough
[1:40:03] unbelief that when that son starts
[1:40:06] pulling at you it'll pull that seed to
[1:40:11] life and you go from weeping to
[1:40:16] shouting the spirit of God it moved with
[1:40:19] love and compassion and the first day of
[1:40:21] dawn the sun rose up it was to bring joy
[1:40:24] and life to the Earth by seed that was a
[1:40:27] great hour but nothing like on that sun
[1:40:30] that Sunrise was nothing like on Easter
[1:40:32] morning this time when the sun leaping
[1:40:35] in the skies it brought forth a greater
[1:40:37] sunlight rise than ever because it came
[1:40:40] with greater news than it did when the
[1:40:42] Sun at the beginning the sunrise brought
[1:40:44] the news he is risen he is quickened
[1:40:47] from the dead as he promised he has
[1:40:49] broke the seals of the Tomb
[1:40:54] the first time the sun rose in Genesis
[1:40:56] it was bringing a message that there
[1:40:59] would be life upon the Earth this time
[1:41:02] the Sun s o n Rose it was a dual sun
[1:41:05] rising another s o n Rising not only a
[1:41:08] su Rising it was a son had risen to
[1:41:11] bring eternal life to All God's promised
[1:41:14] seed by his forn knowledge that was
[1:41:16] laying upon the Earth no more than the
[1:41:18] bod life lived back there in the
[1:41:19] beginning without the sun could bring it
[1:41:21] to life no more today when sun and
[1:41:23] Daughters of God and upon the Earth it
[1:41:25] takes the S so n light to shine down
[1:41:28] upon them and to bring them to
[1:41:31] life that's why you got to have in the
[1:41:35] church without the sun being up in a
[1:41:37] church seeds are not coming to
[1:41:41] life oh they might come to a religion
[1:41:43] they might come to a form of godliness
[1:41:45] but they're not coming to
[1:41:47] life well listen we don't want a brother
[1:41:50] brother Wayne Brother Ray none of
[1:41:52] ministers we don't want we don't want a
[1:41:54] a nest full of rotten
[1:41:56] eggs oh look at all of our eggs we we
[1:41:59] don't care if they're a bunch of eggs if
[1:42:00] they're

[1:42:06] church full of people if they're
[1:42:09] rotten we're not interested in a big big
[1:42:12] numbers if it's just a bunch of rotten
[1:42:14] flesh we want the life of Jesus Christ
[1:42:17] to rise

[1:42:25] then this dirt that have been laid on
[1:42:27] our bodies for some time for we were
[1:42:29] dust in the earth and he said in the
[1:42:30] heaven that was a book of memories and
[1:42:32] attributes knowing that because the Son
[1:42:34] of God raised it would also raise every
[1:42:36] life the life of every son that was for
[1:42:37] ordained for this great time he knew it
[1:42:39] would be he knew it would
[1:42:43] be don't that give you some courage this

[2:05:29] don't have to weep no more but I'm going
[2:05:31] to turn it back to
[2:05:33] rejoicing and this is where John when he
[2:05:36] turned and he saw that
[2:05:39] lamb that was worthy the Bible says the
[2:05:43] Bible
[2:05:45] says he saw him and he heard them begin
[2:05:48] to CL begin to worship Him and and the
[2:05:51] atmospheres begin to change it went from
[2:05:54] weeping to John
[2:05:59] shouting and they sang a new
[2:06:03] song I preached that here at the Youth
[2:06:05] Camp they sang a new
[2:06:07] song why because now they wasn't looking
[2:06:10] at what was unworthy they were looking
[2:06:12] at what was
[2:06:14] worthy if you'll stop looking at what's
[2:06:17] unworthy and start looking at what's
[2:06:19] worthy you'll sing a new song
[2:06:24] I said it you quit you quit singing well
[2:06:26] I'm
[2:06:27] depressed I'm depressed every day that I
[2:06:30] live I'm
[2:06:32] depressed when I wake up in the morning
[2:06:34] when I lay my head to rest I'm
[2:06:38] depressed why you're looking at what's
[2:06:42] unworthy but if you look to the
[2:06:45] lamb you better say I
[2:06:48] blessed I am blessed every day that I
[2:06:51] live I am blessed when I wake up in the
[2:06:53] morning when I lay my head to rest I'm
[2:06:57] blessed Hallelujah listen he's trying to
[2:06:59] turn us from our weeping into
[2:07:05] Joy brother Wayne saying sing that song
[2:07:08] as I come up down from his
[2:07:11] glory that song right
[2:07:14] there means that world to me I won't
[2:07:17] hardly sing it unless I know the
[2:07:18] atmosphere is right it was right this
[2:07:21] morning
[2:07:24] sacred
[2:07:25] moment that God was see fit to come
[2:07:28] down and show us
[2:07:31] himself I was there brother Ron
[2:07:34] Spencer's preaching and I walked away
[2:07:36] from my P iPad didn't have a watch at
[2:07:38] that time that could operate it it went
[2:07:39] dark I'm preaching preaching about the
[2:07:42] three Hebrew children and I was speaking
[2:07:44] about the king he threw him into the
[2:07:46] fire and God has he how the angels and
[2:07:49] God was watching and he said this is for
[2:07:51] me and he took a zigzag of light and the
[2:07:54] boat of lightning and head of Thunder
[2:07:56] went on down and as soon as they went
[2:07:58] into the fire he came down and when I
[2:08:01] said that my iPad went
[2:08:04] off and the voice of the Prophet began
[2:08:07] to speak and he began to speak about he
[2:08:10] said that's the favorite of the hymns he
[2:08:13] said Bruth cber wrote it in a
[2:08:15] cornfield and he said because it
[2:08:17] expresses the extreme dear to the Lord
[2:08:19] Jesus Christ especially in the day that
[2:08:22] we're living
[2:08:24] in it was out of the out of the message
[2:08:26] I can't remember the title of it but
[2:08:28] about the woman who watch jesus'
[2:08:32] feet and I begin to realize God is
[2:08:35] wanting our
[2:08:36] worship that's what he wants but he
[2:08:39] don't want it out of a form or out of a
[2:08:42] got to or it's a Sunday again no I want
[2:08:46] to worship him because he's done so many
[2:08:49] great things for me
[2:08:51] amen amen I thought you know I thought
[2:08:53] at that moment my mom was healed I
[2:08:55] thought man God spoke it's over I was
[2:08:57] looking for an answer and I thought
[2:08:58] that's it but that was wasn't the answer
[2:09:01] go God was given she would later go on
[2:09:05] but I would go from that service and we'
[2:09:07] have a little anniversary and then we'd
[2:09:08] go meet brother Wayne and brother Josh's
[2:09:10] and pre preaches meeting together
[2:09:12] brother R Wayne would preach a sermon on
[2:09:14] you're in line for a miracle I took it I
[2:09:17] said yes I'm in line for a miracle God's
[2:09:20] going to do it and she had been out of
[2:09:22] the hospital for a few days and but I
[2:09:24] was flying back in from that meeting and
[2:09:26] I landed she'd go back in the hospital
[2:09:28] and she would never come out
[2:09:31] again and there I was broken as she
[2:09:34] would pass away and I'm thinking God how
[2:09:36] I saw you do thing I I went to I went to
[2:09:39] a room right after I got back and and I
[2:09:41] and I knew God had spoke and I knew God
[2:09:43] was doing things and I knew God had
[2:09:44] answered and I just knew God was coming
[2:09:46] on the scene and here she was laying in
[2:09:48] a comos condition for 17 hours had not
[2:09:51] spoke to nobody just staring at the
[2:09:53] ceiling and I said Mom I'm here to tell
