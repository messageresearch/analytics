[20:51] by the spoken word of God. And may there
[20:54] be people healed and delivered and saved
[20:58] and filled with the baptism of the Holy
[21:00] Ghost and encouraged and uplifted, Lord,

[21:12] pray you'll bless brother Isaac tonight.
[21:15] May you take this man of God and anoint
[21:18] him and not only anoint him but anoint
[21:21] the congregation. And Father, may the
[21:24] spirit of the Lord have preeminence in
[21:27] every one of our lives. We love you and

[46:42] And I didn't think it could get any
[46:44] better, Sister Barb. But uh Sister Barb
[46:46] Kovi stopped me on the way in tonight
[46:49] and she said, "Brother Wayne, I got some
[46:50] news." [music]
[46:52] I said, "What's that, Sister Barb?" She
[46:53] said, "Well, you know, all them tests
[46:55] they've been running on Brother Mike and
[46:57] uh you know, they they was pretty much
[47:00] pretty sure that he had Parkinsonism,
[47:03] different than Parkinson's disease, but
[47:05] Parkinson's ism." And all of you been
[47:08] praying, the Holy Spirit's been moving.
[47:09] [music] and she said they've done all
[47:11] the tests they could do on him and
[47:12] they've come back that it's not that
[47:15] that maybe he's he got some little
[47:17] something that's a physical problem that
[47:19] he can do some therapy and the Holy
[47:21] Spirit maybe some injury but folks it's
[47:23] went from a great big disease

[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you got if you're facing
[48:04] some great big battle tonight, don't you
[48:05] give up.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you just lay down and take
[48:08] whatever the devil serves you, you send
[48:10] it right back to him
[48:12] &gt;&gt; and you tell him, "I that don't [music]
[48:14] belong to me and I'm not going to sign
[48:16] for that cuz I don't have to."
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Jesus died for us that we might
[48:22] have freedom. Amen. And we have it here
[48:24] tonight as a free people. We're gathered
[48:26] here tonight believing God's going to do
[48:28] something wonderful in this place. I
[48:31] believe the Holy Spirit is still moving.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; You know, uh we've we've uh we call
[48:36] these meetings together and I'm just
[48:37] thinking today when you call a meeting,
[48:40] everybody comes in and wonders what's
[48:41] the meeting about. Well, I'll tell you,
[48:43] I I certainly believe that this [music]
[48:45] is the way that God deals with his
[48:47] children. I believe this is his program.
[48:49] This is God's power program. You you
[48:52] call a meeting, you come together, the
[48:55] musicians do their part, [music] the
[48:57] singers do their part, the ministry does
[48:59] their part, and God does his part, and
[49:01] you have a wonderful meeting. You know,
[49:03] Brother Bram says when a minister walks
[49:05] into [music] the congregation of praying
[49:07] people and the anointing of the Holy
[49:09] Spirit, he said, you're bound [music] to
[49:11] hear from heaven.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; How many come to hear from heaven
[49:14] tonight?
[49:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, Brother Wayne, I I
[49:19] uh we want to we want to hear from God."
[49:21] [music] And Brother Bram said, "The
[49:23] greatest and highest form there is for
[49:26] God to give a message to [music] his
[49:28] people is for the people to believe his
[49:30] word." That's the highest form is the
[49:33] preaching of the gospel
[49:35] &gt;&gt; is the highest form. [music]
[49:37] God didn't choose angels to preach it.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't preach mechanical [music]
[49:42] devices to preach it. But God chose men
[49:45] to preach the gospel.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight we've we've asked
[49:48] a brother to come here that is [music]
[49:50] an agent of God that has prayed and
[49:53] asked. And brother Bram said when a man
[49:55] begins to be led of God, he said you
[49:58] become a messenger of God, God's angel.
[50:01] See, not an angel out of heaven, but an
[50:04] angel in the pullpit.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I tell you tonight, if you
[50:07] just begin to pull on the Holy Spirit, I
[50:10] certainly believe that this is God's
[50:12] provided way to deal with your need. You
[50:14] got something in your heart tonight. You
[50:16] just begin to pull. I know the veil is
[50:19] brother Isaac, and he [music] might be
[50:20] personal to some of you, but there's a
[50:22] gift down in there.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And that Holy Ghost that has come and
[50:26] and and dwelt behind that tabernacle.
[50:28] [music]
[50:29] When you begin to pull, the fire begins
[50:32] to speak and healings begin to happen.
[50:35] deliverances begin to take place. This
[50:37] is the way. This is God's way of feeding
[50:41] and speaking and dealing with his
[50:43] children. Amen. As we come together
[50:45] tonight, won't you stand to your feet as
[50:46] we ask the man of God to come to the
[50:48] platform. [music] Amen. I certainly
[50:51] believe that God has something wonderful
[50:53] in store tonight. Amen. For his mercy
[50:56] and truth. Amen. Brother Ben, if you
[50:58] would. Amen. As we invite the man of God
[51:00] tonight.
[51:02] Come and [singing] go with me
[51:05] to my father's house.
[51:09] Oh, to [music and singing] my father's
[51:11] house. Yeah. To my father's house. Won't
[51:17] you come and go with me?
[51:21] [music] To [singing] my father's house.

[51:28] peace.
[51:31] Oh, [singing] come and go with me
[51:35] [music]
[51:36] to my father's [singing]
[51:38] house.

[51:43] [singing]
[51:44] to my father's house.
[51:47] Come and go with [music and singing] me
[51:50] to my
[51:53] Oh, where [singing] there's
[51:56] [music]
[51:58] peace. Jesus will [singing] be. Oh,
[52:02] Jesus will be there
[52:08] in my
[52:12] in my father's room.
[52:16] [music]
[52:16] Oh, [singing] Jesus will be there
[52:21] in my father's [singing]
[52:23] house where there's peace.
[52:26] [music]
[52:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you give him a hand clap of
[52:35] praise tonight? [applause]
[52:38] Amen.
[52:42] Amen. This is Father's house. [applause]
[52:45] Amen. So if the devil's here tonight,
[52:47] he's trespassing. Amen. Cuz this is
[52:50] Father's house.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've come to Father's house
[52:53] to worship and have a meeting where he's
[52:55] welcome amongst us. Amen. Is that your
[52:58] desire tonight?
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just to fellowship with him. And
[53:01] we just want to greet you all in the
[53:03] name of the Lord. It's good to be in the
[53:05] house of the Lord on a Friday night. And
[53:08] we're just thankful for the opportunity,
[53:10] thankful for our pastor and the meeting
[53:13] that he's set up and just allowed us to
[53:16] be a part. And uh he's been he's been
[53:18] preparing us for this meeting for a
[53:20] couple weeks now, telling us that to
[53:22] those that look for him, he shall
[53:24] appear.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we've come to do
[53:26] this weekend is to look for Jesus.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And if you come to look for a man,
[53:31] you'll be disappointed. But if you've
[53:32] come to look for him, he shall appear.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be with him and my
[53:39] buddies, Brother Nathan and Brother
[53:41] Ronnie. And they've been two of the most
[53:43] influential people in my life. And so I
[53:46] know the Lord's used them mightily for
[53:47] me. And I believe he's going to use them
[53:49] this weekend.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; And so we're just under expectation.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[53:56] we'll turn to the book of Matthew,
[53:58] chapter 16,
[54:00] and then 1 John 4. Thank you musicians
[54:03] for the music and the song specials. And
[54:05] it is good to see our brother Diego and
[54:08] &gt;&gt; brother Chris tonight and all the
[54:10] visitors. We just say God bless you.
[54:14] Matthew 16 starting in verse 13
[54:19] says when Jesus came into the coast of
[54:21] Cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[54:23] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[54:26] man am'? And they said some say that
[54:28] thou art John the Baptist some Elias and
[54:31] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
[54:33] And he saith unto them but whom say ye
[54:36] that I am? And Simon Peter answered and
[54:38] said thou art the Christ the son of the
[54:40] living God? [snorts] And Jesus answered
[54:42] and said unto him, "Blessed art thou,
[54:44] Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood hath
[54:46] not revealed it unto thee, but my father
[54:48] which is in heaven, and I say also unto
[54:51] thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this
[54:53] rock I'll build my church, and the gates
[54:55] of hell shall not prevail against it.
[54:57] And I will give unto thee the keys of
[54:59] the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever
[55:01] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[55:03] in heaven. Whatsoever thou shalt loose
[55:05] on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
[55:07] then charged he his disciples that they
[55:09] should tell no man that he was Jesus the
[55:12] Christ. In 1 John 4 the first four
[55:15] verses it says beloved believe not every
[55:18] spirit but try the spirits whether they
[55:21] are of God because many false prophets
[55:23] are gone out into the world. Hereby know
[55:26] you the spirit of God. Every spirit that
[55:28] confessth that Jesus Christ and come is
[55:30] come in the flesh is of God. And every
[55:32] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[55:34] Christ has come in the flesh is not of
[55:36] God. And this is that spirit of
[55:38] Antichrist, wherever you have heard that
[55:39] it should come, and even now already is
[55:42] it in the world. But ye are of God,
[55:44] little children,
[55:46] &gt;&gt; and have overcome them.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Because greater is he that's in you than
[55:49] he that's in the world.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we bow our heads tonight for
[55:53] a word of prayer?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; If you have a need, just make it known
[55:57] unto the Lord.
[56:00] Heavenly Father,
[56:02] Lord, it's just so good to be in your
[56:04] house tonight, Father.
[56:07] Lord, and we believe that just a one
[56:09] word from you, Lord, will silence the
[56:12] voice of every spirit, Father. I pray,
[56:15] Lord, that the holy hush of your
[56:17] presence would just sweep through this
[56:18] building, Father, now, and silence every
[56:21] spirit. Lord, every nervous mother,
[56:24] Father, every Lord, worry about the weak
[56:28] and what's behind us or what's ahead of
[56:30] us, Father. Lord, may you settle over
[56:33] this building, Father, and wash away,
[56:35] Lord, every fear and every worry, Lord,
[56:38] and just step down into our midst. I
[56:41] pray, Father, that we might know that
[56:42] you're here and that you've dwelt among
[56:45] us, Lord. Lord, may we walk and talk
[56:48] with you for a moment. I pray father
[56:50] this weekend as we commit this into your
[56:53] hands in Jesus name.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats tonight.
[56:59] Amen. I'd like to if that's okay just
[57:01] for a few minutes just to take a thought
[57:04] out of those two texts on it is
[57:06] recognizing time.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is recognizing time and and for
[57:11] a bit of just a sub thought that's just
[57:13] real similar is the power of
[57:15] recognition.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I believe that's what
[57:18] we've gathered in this meeting to do.
[57:19] It's for one purpose. And brother
[57:21] Brandon would tell us. He said, "We're
[57:23] going to try to hurry up to get out.
[57:25] We're working for this one purpose for
[57:26] you to recognize the presence of Jesus
[57:28] Christ." If he is present, then
[57:31] everything is settled.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that he is here
[57:35] because he said, "Wherever two or three
[57:36] are gathered in my name, there I will be
[57:38] in the midst of them."
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want to recognize it. Amen.
[57:42] And I believe there's three things that
[57:44] I want to focus on that we want to
[57:45] recognize. And I believe that all three
[57:47] are taking place even now. It's the
[57:50] power of God and and Satan and then of
[57:53] yourself. And I believe all three of
[57:55] those things are gathered in this
[57:56] meeting. Amen. And but we want to
[57:59] recognize that. And we found that in
[58:01] First John, those three categories
[58:03] because it says, "Ye are of God, little
[58:06] children, and have overcome them, the
[58:08] devil, because greater is he that is in
[58:11] you than he that is in the world." Amen.
[58:14] And so we three categories that have
[58:16] gathered. There's God, there's Satan,
[58:18] and there's you. And to recognize means
[58:20] to identify someone or something from
[58:23] previous encounters or knowledge or to
[58:25] acknowledge something's existence
[58:27] validity or legality that something is
[58:30] recognized or would be to perceive
[58:32] clearly or realize. So we find that
[58:34] recognizing has no impact on identity.
[58:37] Recognizing doesn't change anything.
[58:40] Recognize doesn't make something become
[58:42] something different. recognizing is is
[58:44] clearly and simply realizing what
[58:46] something already is. Like if you're
[58:49] driving down the road, Papa Vernon, and
[58:51] you see a light on the road and you say,
[58:53] "What is that light? Why is it moving
[58:54] like that?" And you say, you know, "Is
[58:56] it a car or is a is it a motorcycle?"
[58:59] And the closer you get, you realize what
[59:01] it is. Maybe it's a man with a
[59:03] flashlight. And you say, "Ah, I didn't
[59:05] know what it was until I seen it clearly
[59:07] and now I know what it is." A and and
[59:10] when we recognize it takes the confusion
[59:12] away because there you were confused.
[59:14] But when you recognize what something
[59:16] is, it takes the confusion away. Amen.
[59:19] That's why Satan, if he can just get you
[59:22] confused on your identity and say, "Why
[59:24] am I thinking these thoughts? Why am I
[59:26] going through these things? If I have
[59:28] the Holy Ghost, if I'm a son of God, why
[59:30] is this in my life?" life. If he can
[59:32] begin to bring confusion in your mind on
[59:34] your identity, then your world will turn
[59:37] upside down and you'll start to struggle
[59:39] in battle where if you just knew what
[59:41] you were, that would be a very small
[59:42] thing to you. But it's confusion that
[59:44] makes it a very large thing. Amen. Just
[59:47] like the disciples when they didn't
[59:49] recognize Jesus walking on the water, it
[59:52] brought confusion and fear saying, "Who
[59:54] is that? Is it a spirit?" But when they
[59:56] [snorts] recognized it, amen, they
[59:58] recognized that it was the son of God.
[1:00:00] And when they invited them into the
[1:00:01] boat, it settled the storms of their
[1:00:03] life. Amen. Amen. But we're living in a
[1:00:06] world of confusion. There's so much
[1:00:08] confusion. And brother Brandon told us
[1:00:10] that the reason there's confusion is not
[1:00:12] because that Jesus isn't here. It's
[1:00:14] because that he hasn't been allowed
[1:00:16] access to the places he's trying to go.
[1:00:19] Amen. He said, "Behold, I stand at the
[1:00:21] door and knock." But the church did not
[1:00:23] let him in. And so they chose instead to
[1:00:26] live in darkness and confusion instead
[1:00:28] of letting the man who could turn on the
[1:00:31] light into their midst. Amen. To take
[1:00:33] the confusion away. Oh, because Isaiah
[1:00:36] said, "Behold, darkness shall be upon
[1:00:38] the earth and gross darkness upon the
[1:00:41] people. Confusion of mind." Amen.
[1:00:43] Confusion of doctrine, confusion of
[1:00:45] everything, confusion of identity. Amen.
[1:00:48] In a dark in a dark and dismal day.
[1:00:51] Amen. Because Amos prophesied that there
[1:00:53] would be a famine in the land. And it
[1:00:56] wouldn't be a famine for water or bread,
[1:00:58] but a famine. Amen. To hear the true
[1:01:01] word of God. And people would go to and
[1:01:03] fro in a day of confusion seeking to
[1:01:06] hear the word of God. Oh, Brother Brham
[1:01:08] said, "What would you give in this day
[1:01:10] of confusion in exchange for the message
[1:01:13] of the hour?" Amen. What would you give
[1:01:16] in exchange for the truth? To know where
[1:01:18] you stand, to know who you are, to know
[1:01:21] where we're at. I say I wouldn't give
[1:01:22] anything in exchange in a day of
[1:01:25] confusion for a message of clarity and
[1:01:27] truth.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, confusion comes from lack of
[1:01:31] understanding. Brother Bram said, "The
[1:01:33] reason people don't understand the
[1:01:34] message and the scriptures are trying to
[1:01:36] bring to them is because they don't
[1:01:38] recognize the day that they're living
[1:01:40] in. That's why they don't understand,
[1:01:42] Amen, the scriptures that are being
[1:01:44] unveiled in this hour. And why does it
[1:01:47] matter? Because you just can't base
[1:01:49] faith in confusion. Brother Brandham
[1:01:51] taught us. And I'm sure we can all
[1:01:53] attest to that, that there's been times
[1:01:55] in your life where you were under
[1:01:56] confusion, and you can't base faith upon
[1:01:59] confusion. So, you must come out of that
[1:02:02] confusion. Amen. To get to a place of
[1:02:04] faith to get somewhere with God. Oh, and
[1:02:08] that that explains to us why there is
[1:02:10] such an attack on recognition in this
[1:02:12] day. Because brother Brandham said he's
[1:02:14] trying to get you to not realize who you
[1:02:16] are. Because if you don't know who you
[1:02:19] are, then he said that little hand
[1:02:21] raising, Satan will try to tell you that
[1:02:23] there's nothing to that. Amen. And if
[1:02:25] you'll believe that voice, Amen. And
[1:02:27] then the power behind the raising of
[1:02:29] your hand, the power behind the visit to
[1:02:31] the altar, [laughter] the power behind
[1:02:33] passing through the prayer line won't
[1:02:35] mean anything to you if Satan will talk
[1:02:38] you out of who you are. Amen. But if
[1:02:40] you'll recognize who you are, you'll
[1:02:42] recognize that when you raise your hand,
[1:02:44] amen, God is recognizing your heart and
[1:02:47] you're receiving the promise that you're
[1:02:49] raising your hand, too. When you're
[1:02:51] visiting an altar, amen, you are
[1:02:53] encountering a living God. Amen. If you
[1:02:56] meet in there, it's a real experience.
[1:02:58] And Satan would like to talk you out of
[1:03:00] that. Amen. But he is a liar. He is a
[1:03:03] bluff. Amen. He is identified by his
[1:03:06] characteristics. And he's a squatter.
[1:03:08] Amen. He's a deceiver. He's a perverter
[1:03:11] and a thief. Amen. But he's defeated.
[1:03:14] Amen. He has no power. He's limitless.
[1:03:18] Amen. It's the characteristics of Satan.
[1:03:20] Amen. He has no place in here tonight
[1:03:23] because he doesn't want you to recognize
[1:03:26] by revelation who you are. And he
[1:03:29] doesn't want you to recognize who he is.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Because when Peter recognized, Amen.
[1:03:34] Jesus spoke back, "Upon this rock, I'll
[1:03:37] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:03:39] can't prevail against it." Oh, and Satan
[1:03:42] wants to prevail against you. So, he
[1:03:44] don't want you to recognize. Oh, but if
[1:03:47] you ever get the revelation, Amen, you
[1:03:49] can be talked into something and talked
[1:03:51] out. But when the revelation ever
[1:03:53] strikes your heart, the gates of hell
[1:03:55] shall not prevail against you when you
[1:03:58] recognize who you are. Oh, the church is
[1:04:01] not built upon Peter. The church is not
[1:04:04] built upon big buildings. The church is
[1:04:06] built upon revelation of who Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ is personally to you. Oh, that's
[1:04:13] why Satan hates the two books of the
[1:04:15] Bible. That's Genesis and Revelations
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; because brother Brand said it reveals
[1:04:20] his ways. We find his origin, his awful
[1:04:23] ways and his destruction. [gasps] And
[1:04:25] Jesus said about Satan, he has no part
[1:04:27] in me and I have no part in him. And
[1:04:31] brother Bam said, "The devil would like
[1:04:32] to prove that different, but he cannot."
[1:04:35] So he does all he can to destroy
[1:04:37] confidence in the word. Didn't we hear
[1:04:39] that Sunday? But when the church
[1:04:41] disbelieves Satan and believes the
[1:04:44] spirit's revelation of the word, the
[1:04:46] gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:04:50] her. Oh, I like what brother Brandham
[1:04:52] said. Satan hates revelation because it
[1:04:54] upsets his plans. I say, glory to God.
[1:04:57] [laughter] Amen. Satan had a plan for
[1:04:59] your life, but revelation came and it
[1:05:02] upset his plans. Amen. Satan wanted to
[1:05:04] keep you bound in those traditions, but
[1:05:06] revelation came and it upset his plans.
[1:05:09] He wanted to keep you bound in sickness.
[1:05:11] He wanted to keep you bound in fear. He
[1:05:13] wanted to keep you bound in depression.
[1:05:15] But revelation came one day and it upset
[1:05:18] the plans of Satan. And you recognize
[1:05:21] that he is the defeated devil. And when
[1:05:23] the spirit when the church recognizes
[1:05:26] those two spirits, when she recognizes
[1:05:28] what she is and what she stands for, she
[1:05:30] will become an invincible army. And the
[1:05:33] gates of hell will not be able to
[1:05:35] prevail against the church under
[1:05:38] revelation. Satan hates revelation
[1:05:40] because he hates to be exposed. That's
[1:05:42] what brother Brandham said. you watch a
[1:05:44] meeting. He said when that devil's right
[1:05:46] about to be exposed, he said the look on
[1:05:48] their face will begin to change because
[1:05:50] that devil knows he's about to be
[1:05:52] exposed. Amen. I say let's have an
[1:05:54] exposing meeting tonight. Amen. Let's
[1:05:57] expose Satan in false worship. Let's
[1:05:59] expose him in dead religion. Let's
[1:06:02] expose him in the fear he puts upon our
[1:06:04] daughters. Let's expose him in the
[1:06:06] pressure he puts upon our sons and
[1:06:09] expose Satan. And Satan will become
[1:06:11] powerless. And how will we expose him?
[1:06:14] By the preaching of the word of God.
[1:06:16] We'll expose Satan every time,
[1:06:18] everywhere, every place. You see, you're
[1:06:22] worried Satan's going to expose you.
[1:06:24] [laughter] Amen. But you're, as the word
[1:06:26] comes forth, not only does it expose
[1:06:28] Satan, but it exposes who you are. Amen.
[1:06:32] Because you're worried that Satan's
[1:06:34] going to expose you as not good enough.
[1:06:36] He's going to expose you as a liar.
[1:06:38] [laughter] He's going to expose you as
[1:06:40] foolish virgin. Amen. But I like what
[1:06:42] brother Brandham said. He said someone
[1:06:45] told him that two FBI agents were going
[1:06:46] to come down and expose him at that
[1:06:48] meeting. And so he said, "All right, if
[1:06:50] I'm doing something contrary to the
[1:06:51] word, then come expose [laughter] me. I
[1:06:54] want to be right." But when the Spirit
[1:06:56] of Revelation dropped into the building,
[1:06:58] [laughter] not only did it not expose
[1:07:00] Brother Brandham is wrong, but it
[1:07:02] exposed those two FBI FBI agents as
[1:07:04] backsliding preachers, and it exposed
[1:07:07] Brother Brandham as a true prophet of
[1:07:09] God. Oh, what the enemy meant for evil.
[1:07:12] God has worked for good. Satan has tried
[1:07:15] to expose you. And you've worried that
[1:07:17] you were going to be exposed. But when
[1:07:19] this message came over your life, it
[1:07:21] exposed the devil as a liar. And it
[1:07:23] exposed you as a son and daughter of
[1:07:25] God. It exposed you as an overcomer. It
[1:07:28] exposed you as a rapture ready born
[1:07:31] again son of the living God. When
[1:07:33] revelation came to your heart, oh this
[1:07:36] message, he said, I thought I was just a
[1:07:38] a shyer, but this message exposed that
[1:07:41] you were Jacob. He said, I thought I was
[1:07:43] just a doubter, but this message exposed
[1:07:45] that you were Thomas and your name is on
[1:07:48] the lamb's book of life because the word
[1:07:50] [laughter] of God is a discerner of the
[1:07:52] thoughts and intents of the heart. Oh,
[1:07:55] when the enemy comes in like a flood, I
[1:07:57] will raise up a standard. Darkness and
[1:07:59] gross darkness, but arise, shine. Thy
[1:08:02] light has come.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light of the message has come
[1:08:05] to expose the enemy tonight.
[1:08:09] [snorts]
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's why we can say it's
[1:08:11] recognizing time.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon preached a
[1:08:16] message recognizing your day in his
[1:08:17] message.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Past 25 years, Israel has
[1:08:22] just recognized they're in the homeland
[1:08:24] for something."
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was prophesied they'd have to
[1:08:27] be gathered again. Hosea said so. We
[1:08:31] read it a while ago. We'll read it right
[1:08:34] now. Hosea 6. Come and let us return
[1:08:36] unto the Lord. For he hath torn and he
[1:08:39] will heal us. He has smitten and he will
[1:08:41] bind us up. After two days will he
[1:08:44] revive us, but in the third day he will
[1:08:46] raise us up and we shall live in his
[1:08:48] sight. Brother Brandham said, "Israel
[1:08:51] has just recognized they're in the
[1:08:52] homeland for something. God, help us to
[1:08:54] understand it. At the same time, the
[1:08:56] bride has recognized the evening light
[1:08:59] and just begin to recognize the hungry
[1:09:01] Pentecostals have began to recognize
[1:09:02] that them organizations hasn't got
[1:09:04] anything. Hasn't got anything. The He
[1:09:08] said, just recognize the evening light.
[1:09:11] It hasn't got anything they're looking
[1:09:12] for. They're so twisted and tore up.
[1:09:14] See, he said, see, it's the time of
[1:09:16] recognition. You've got to recognize.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; The world has recognized. The nations
[1:09:21] has recognized. Science has recognized,
[1:09:24] the devil has recognized it's the time
[1:09:26] that he can wreck women, wreck the
[1:09:28] church, wreck the people. He's
[1:09:29] recognized it. And God has recognized
[1:09:32] that there's a people on earth that he
[1:09:33] predestinated to life. He recognized
[1:09:36] this is the time to send his message.
[1:09:38] The people has recognized it. The bright
[1:09:41] time has realized the evening light. Oh
[1:09:44] my. [laughter] Brother Brandon was
[1:09:46] preaching on to us in 1964. Recognize
[1:09:49] your day. In his message, he said, "I
[1:09:51] Hosea prophesied that in the third day,
[1:09:54] he would gather his children again." And
[1:09:57] it's been 2700 years when Brother
[1:09:59] Brandham preached it. And he's saying
[1:10:01] God is fulfilling his prophecy. He's
[1:10:04] gathering his nation, Israel, into the
[1:10:06] land. And Israel is only waiting for the
[1:10:08] bride to get out of the way so they can
[1:10:11] recognize their Messiah. And then he
[1:10:13] starts to say, "Why did Russia wake up?
[1:10:15] Why did the nations wake up? Why did
[1:10:18] science wake up? Why has man been able
[1:10:21] to achieve? And why has the church
[1:10:23] failed to recognize their day? You see,
[1:10:25] Israel had to be blinded so the church
[1:10:28] could recognize. But it's made a full
[1:10:30] circle. And the church is being blinded.
[1:10:33] Amen. So Israel can recognize. Amen. He
[1:10:36] said, "Oh, it's like a baby that brother
[1:10:39] Bram talked about not responding to that
[1:10:41] rattler." Amen. They can't recognize
[1:10:43] although it's coming to pass right in
[1:10:45] front of them. and they are naked,
[1:10:47] miserable, wretched, and blind because
[1:10:49] they didn't recognize. But at the same
[1:10:51] time, he said, "A bride has recognized
[1:10:54] the evening light." Amen. The world has
[1:10:56] not recognized the awakening of the
[1:10:59] bride. But she was awakened by the seven
[1:11:02] seals, saying, "Why are we here? Why are
[1:11:04] we in our homeland? Why have we been
[1:11:06] gathered together under Malachi 4?" A
[1:11:09] mean why is all this taking place? Amen.
[1:11:11] We were not put here by national force,
[1:11:14] but we were put here by the power of the
[1:11:17] message of the hour. The power of God
[1:11:19] has gathered a bride that she might
[1:11:22] begin to recognize, amen, that this is
[1:11:24] our season. Oh, if Israel's season is
[1:11:28] coming after we're taken away, then our
[1:11:30] season must not be off in the future.
[1:11:32] Our season must be now. Oh, brother Bam
[1:11:36] said, "Why has science just in the last
[1:11:39] few years been able to realize that they
[1:11:42] cannot just travel 30 m an hour, but
[1:11:44] they can travel 17,000 m an hour? Why
[1:11:48] has it happened? It had to be that way."
[1:11:51] Amen. Because we've come into an age of
[1:11:53] new possibilities. Amen. Things have
[1:11:56] begin to awaken. [laughter] The bride
[1:11:58] has begun to recognize that we are not
[1:12:00] in Luther's day anymore. We are not in
[1:12:02] Wesley's day anymore, but we are in the
[1:12:05] astronaut age. Amen. Recognize the
[1:12:08] potential. Amen. Of what could happen in
[1:12:10] a meeting like this. Amen. There has
[1:12:12] been an awakening, brother Carrie. The
[1:12:15] bride is recognizing her position in the
[1:12:17] word of God. Amen. Not looking back.
[1:12:21] That's been the fault through the ages.
[1:12:23] Looking back, when Jesus was here, they
[1:12:25] looked back to say, "Oh, we believe
[1:12:27] Moses. We're Moses disciples." Amen.
[1:12:31] Amen. If you would just Amen. say what
[1:12:33] Moses said. He said, "If you would have
[1:12:35] believed Moses, you would have believed
[1:12:36] me." The church has been looking back.
[1:12:39] [laughter] Amen. Looking in the rearview
[1:12:40] mirror, Amen. to a day gone by. And
[1:12:43] that's Satan's tactic still tonight to
[1:12:45] try to get you to look behind you, to
[1:12:47] miss the blessing that is taking place
[1:12:49] right now. Amen. That's why he's trying
[1:12:52] to keep you tore up with all kinds of
[1:12:54] things and all kinds of trouble. Keep
[1:12:56] you tore up at your brother, keep you
[1:12:58] tore up at your sister. But it is a
[1:13:00] season to lay aside the things that are
[1:13:03] behind and press towards the mark of the
[1:13:06] prize of the high calling. Amen. Forget
[1:13:09] those things which are behind you. Say
[1:13:11] it's hard. It's hard to let go. It's
[1:13:13] hard to forgive. But wouldn't it be
[1:13:16] worth it?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth it to get your joy
[1:13:18] back?
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth it to get your
[1:13:21] peace back?
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth it to be a real
[1:13:23] father again? Wouldn't it be worth it to
[1:13:26] be a real mother again? Wouldn't it be
[1:13:28] worth it to let go and stop looking back
[1:13:31] and release it into the blood and move
[1:13:34] forward into the promises of God?
[1:13:36] Church, this is your season to be
[1:13:38] blessed. Amen. This is revival time.
[1:13:40] [cheering]
[1:13:41] Amen. We don't need another awakening.
[1:13:43] We just need a recognition that revival
[1:13:46] is here tonight. Oh, you say, "I'm
[1:13:49] hungry for revival, Brother Isaac." I
[1:13:51] say it's here. I say it's only time to
[1:13:54] get on board. Oh, you say, "What if the
[1:13:57] church moves on without me?" How can the
[1:13:59] church move on without you when you are
[1:14:00] the church? I mean, we're waiting on you
[1:14:03] to get in the revival and become a part
[1:14:06] of it yourself. Oh, we can't go without
[1:14:08] our sons. We can't go without our
[1:14:10] daughters. We can't go without our
[1:14:13] elders. We can't go without our young
[1:14:15] people. Amen. Revival is here.
[1:14:17] [laughter] Amen. The set time to favor
[1:14:20] Zion has come. It's a season of
[1:14:23] blessing. It's a season of recognition.
[1:14:27] Amen. That we are not looking to the
[1:14:28] millennium. Now we are sons and
[1:14:31] daughters of God. Now we are the
[1:14:33] children of God.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, a season of recognizing. Amen. When
[1:14:39] I was a child, I spake as a child, but
[1:14:42] when I became a man, I put away childish
[1:14:44] things. And Paul said, for we'd see
[1:14:47] through a glass darkly, but then face to
[1:14:49] face. Now I know in part, but then shall
[1:14:52] I know even as I am known.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; You know, when we named our son Spencer
[1:14:59] Warren Hatfield,
[1:15:02] he was always Spencer Warren Hatfield.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; But he didn't know it for a while. I
[1:15:07] mean, but as he began to grow, we begin
[1:15:09] to tutor him. Your name is Spencer.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Your name is Spencer Warren Hatfield.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And now we can tell him, "Hey buddy, are
[1:15:18] are you a dinosaur?" story. He said,
[1:15:19] "No." "Are you a chicken?" "No, you're a
[1:15:23] crocodile, aren't you?" "No, I'm Spencer
[1:15:26] Warren Hatfield." And it comes right out
[1:15:28] of his mouth because when I he was a
[1:15:32] baby, you might have been able to
[1:15:34] deceive him, but when he sat under the
[1:15:37] tutorship of his father and mother,
[1:15:39] Amen. Good luck trying to deceive him.
[1:15:41] Now, he already knows who he is. Amen.
[1:15:44] And there shall arise false Christ and
[1:15:46] false prophets. that shall arise false
[1:15:48] spirits. But to you who have been
[1:15:50] sitting under the tutorship of the
[1:15:52] message of the hour, the elect cannot be
[1:15:55] deceived because you've already
[1:15:57] recognized who you are. And brother
[1:15:59] Brandham said that is for this day
[1:16:01] because this is the age of the coming of
[1:16:03] the Lord. This is the time when we will
[1:16:06] go from partial realization to perfect
[1:16:09] realization where we will have a perfect
[1:16:11] realization. Amen. Of who we are, of who
[1:16:14] he is. And I know that lays in the
[1:16:17] coming of the Lord, but I believe it is
[1:16:19] taking place right now under the message
[1:16:21] of the hour. We have come from partial
[1:16:24] understanding to perfect understanding
[1:16:27] of who we are, of who the devil is, and
[1:16:30] of who our God is. Amen. This message
[1:16:33] brought proper identification.
[1:16:35] In the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:16:37] angel, the mystery should be finished.
[1:16:39] Evening time, it shall be light. Amen.
[1:16:43] Properly identifying. If you want to
[1:16:45] know what a Christian looks like,
[1:16:46] Brother Josh, search the message. If you
[1:16:49] want to know what the three poles are,
[1:16:51] search the message. Brother Brandham
[1:16:52] said, they've been properly identified.
[1:16:55] If you want to know what the seventh
[1:16:56] angel is going to look like, search the
[1:16:58] message. He'll be like Elijah. He'll be
[1:17:00] an outdoorsman. He'll be a he'll be a
[1:17:03] woodsman. He'll be against Jezebel. And
[1:17:05] if you want to know what this message,
[1:17:07] if you want to know if this message is
[1:17:08] true, just search the scripture.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Search the message. It's been properly
[1:17:13] identified. Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spirits that have always existed.
[1:17:16] Now we can describe what they are like.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "What's a nickelan spirit?" We
[1:17:21] can describe it perfectly
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; because under the second pole of this
[1:17:25] message, Amen. Amen. Every spirit has
[1:17:29] been properly identified. Amen. We could
[1:17:31] compile the prayer lines and you could
[1:17:33] write a thesaurus. Amen. Of nervous
[1:17:36] spirits, of depression spirits, amen, of
[1:17:39] anxiety, of oppression, of every spirit
[1:17:41] there is. Because brother Brandham
[1:17:43] encountered them and under that second
[1:17:44] pole, Amen. It identified every spirit.
[1:17:48] Amen. That you and me might be able to
[1:17:50] overcome that devil.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Amen. Satan has recognized
[1:17:55] his season.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that he has because brother
[1:17:58] Brandham said it. It's the season that
[1:18:00] he can wreck woman. It's the season he
[1:18:02] can wreck the church.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; But it's a season. And I want him to
[1:18:07] recognize his season because I mean,
[1:18:09] it's only a span of time.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there will come a time where
[1:18:13] he will be cast into the lake of fire
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; and his season will be over.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even while he's here, we have
[1:18:21] been given the ability to overcome him.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "How do you
[1:18:25] overcome?" To recognize the devil in
[1:18:27] every one of his tricks. You must
[1:18:29] recognize him real. You must must
[1:18:31] recognize him a devil. You must
[1:18:33] recognize he's against you. You must
[1:18:35] recognize his tricks. And then you can
[1:18:37] recognize that greater is he that is in
[1:18:40] you than he that is in the world.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is he a devil?
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Is he real? Brother Brandham said
[1:18:48] he's a real devil. Just like Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ is not a thought, but he's a real
[1:18:53] person.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Is he against you? Yes. I don't think we
[1:18:57] have to even take 10 minutes to explain
[1:19:00] that to you tonight. If Satan is not
[1:19:03] after you, he's got you. Brother
[1:19:05] Brandham said. But as long as he's after
[1:19:07] you, it shows that he hasn't got you
[1:19:10] yet. So just keep on moving forward.
[1:19:13] Amen. But he's against you. You say,
[1:19:15] "Why am I thinking these thoughts?"
[1:19:16] Because the devil's against you. You
[1:19:19] say, "Why am I going through such a hard
[1:19:21] time?" Because sometimes Satan knows
[1:19:23] your future better than you know it
[1:19:25] yourself. And he knows that you're going
[1:19:27] to grow up to be a minister. And so he
[1:19:29] attacks you. And he attacks you. Ever
[1:19:31] before you know your identity, Satan is
[1:19:33] attacking you. And it isn't until you
[1:19:36] recognize your identity that you can
[1:19:37] recognize why you were going through
[1:19:39] those things. Amen. Every son and
[1:19:41] daughter of God. Amen. When you're still
[1:19:44] in that struggle, you wonder why you're
[1:19:46] going through the things. Why am I like
[1:19:48] this? But when you identify yourself as
[1:19:50] a son or a daughter, then you can
[1:19:53] identify why you were going to through
[1:19:55] the things that you were going through.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Satan's got a right to
[1:19:59] that punch.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to guard that area.
[1:20:03] Yeah.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't try to live at peace with
[1:20:05] the devil.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaac and Ishmael cannot live at
[1:20:10] peace together.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; You can watch it taking place right now.
[1:20:13] So don't try to live at peace with the
[1:20:15] devil. Amen. Don't try to live at peace
[1:20:18] with that habit. Don't try to live at
[1:20:20] peace with that addiction. He's against
[1:20:22] you. He's your adversary. Amen. He's a
[1:20:26] liar. He's a destroyer. And what
[1:20:28] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:20:31] idols? Amen. You must recognize his
[1:20:33] tricks.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And then here's one I want to deal with.
[1:20:37] He's got a lot of tricks, [snorts]
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; but brother Bram said when the devil
[1:20:42] likes to, he says, "And they were very
[1:20:44] downcast." It's so easy to become,
[1:20:47] especially when you are oppressed.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil likes to work on
[1:20:55] you and oppress you. You know that's a
[1:20:57] trick of the devil to oppress. Yeah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; But when the Christian knows his legal
[1:21:02] rights, when you can quote God's word,
[1:21:04] I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee,
[1:21:07] that takes all the oppression away, and
[1:21:10] the clouds begin to clear back. If you
[1:21:13] just know God has promised and God is
[1:21:15] faithful, he can keep his promise or he
[1:21:17] wouldn't have promised it.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The definition of oppression is
[1:21:22] cruel, unfair, and prolonged
[1:21:24] mistreatment or control of people,
[1:21:27] often by those in power, taking away
[1:21:30] their freedom, rights, and opportunities
[1:21:33] through unjust law, systems, or actions,
[1:21:35] creating hardship and misery. It's more
[1:21:38] than an isolated incident. It's the
[1:21:40] systematic pervasive pattern of limiting
[1:21:43] a group like based on race, gender, or
[1:21:45] beliefs, and making them feel burdened
[1:21:47] or crushed.
[1:21:49] Amen. If you've ever been under an
[1:21:51] oppressive spirit, you know what that's
[1:21:53] like. Brother Brandon would call him out
[1:21:55] in prayer lines and say, "Here, it's a
[1:21:57] little nervous mother." And Satan's
[1:22:00] trying to take her life. He's trying to
[1:22:02] shorten her days. Amen. [snorts] By an
[1:22:04] oppressive spirit, nervousness,
[1:22:06] oppression. He said, "The oppression of
[1:22:08] pride, the oppression of thinking that
[1:22:11] you send away your day of grace." He
[1:22:14] said, "There's [snorts] many people here
[1:22:15] tonight that really wants to come right
[1:22:17] here. I believe it's to the altar. But
[1:22:19] the oppression of the devil is trying to
[1:22:21] hold you back. The oppression,
[1:22:24] oppression of nervousness, oppression of
[1:22:26] depression, oppression of fear,
[1:22:29] oppression of of not knowing who you
[1:22:32] are. And when brother said, "The
[1:22:34] oppression of the enemy is strong, but
[1:22:36] thou art stronger. And greater is he
[1:22:39] that's in us than he that's in the
[1:22:41] world." And that's how you overcome the
[1:22:43] devil is to recognize greater is he
[1:22:45] that's in me than he that's in the
[1:22:47] world. Amen. You see there's a
[1:22:49] difference between oppression and
[1:22:51] possession. Amen. Oppression is a cloud
[1:22:54] that hangs over you. Amen. Possession
[1:22:57] means that he's got you. And that's what
[1:22:59] you want to recognize about oppression
[1:23:02] is that it's just means that Satan is
[1:23:04] attacking you but he cannot get you
[1:23:07] because possession means that he owns
[1:23:09] you. Amen. And so Satan cannot get you
[1:23:13] because God already has you.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like that lying spirit that came
[1:23:17] and got into those 400 preachers in the
[1:23:20] days of Ahab and Jehoshaphat. Amen. But
[1:23:23] he couldn't get into Micaiah because
[1:23:25] Micaiah was a word prophet of God. Amen.
[1:23:28] And God got to you before Satan could
[1:23:31] ever get to you. And so Satan can only
[1:23:33] oppress you. But he cannot possess you
[1:23:36] because God came. And before the
[1:23:38] foundation of the world, he sealed your
[1:23:41] spiritual womb with the seed of God. Oh,
[1:23:45] amen. Can you help me tonight? Amen. God
[1:23:47] sealed your womb before the devil ever
[1:23:50] got to you. And you are sealed and you
[1:23:53] are his tonight. Amen. Because before
[1:23:55] the foundation of the world, he put the
[1:23:57] predestinated band of unmmerited grace
[1:24:00] and favor on your life and sealed you.
[1:24:03] Amen. A seal means ownership. It means
[1:24:06] that Satan cannot get you any longer
[1:24:08] because God already sealed you before
[1:24:11] the foundation of the world. Oh, you
[1:24:14] were his. You may not recognize it yet,
[1:24:16] [laughter] but if your name is on that
[1:24:18] book, Amen. And you may not even have
[1:24:20] the Holy Ghost yet, but that earthly
[1:24:22] seal is coming because God has already
[1:24:24] recognized you in heaven. Oh, glory. And
[1:24:28] he will recognize your faith and give
[1:24:30] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:24:33] Because recognizing doesn't change your
[1:24:36] identity. It only realizes who you are.
[1:24:39] That's why the prodigal son could only
[1:24:41] go so far before he had to come to
[1:24:44] himself and recognize that he was still
[1:24:47] the son of his father. And my brother
[1:24:49] Bam said, "You always were a son of God.
[1:24:52] It's not what you will be. It's not what
[1:24:54] you're going to be. You have always
[1:24:56] been. And you will always be a son of
[1:24:59] God." And you must recognize.
[1:25:02] Amen. Even if you don't recognize it
[1:25:05] yet, Brother Brandon would say about
[1:25:08] Sarah, [sighs] you know, she doubted
[1:25:10] Abraham. She doubted the word of Melzdc.
[1:25:13] And brother Brandham said, "I feel led
[1:25:14] of the Lord to say this in a meeting one
[1:25:16] time." He said, "You may be doubting me
[1:25:18] now, but I can see past that. That one
[1:25:22] of these days you're going to believe
[1:25:23] it. I can see farther than that. You may
[1:25:26] be doubting me now. You may be oppressed
[1:25:28] by a spirit of unbelief now, but I can
[1:25:31] see past that. that one of these days,
[1:25:33] Terara, because you are a part of
[1:25:35] Abraham, I cannot curse you and you will
[1:25:39] come to recognition that this is nothing
[1:25:41] but the truth. I mean, you say, "I can't
[1:25:43] see it, brother Isaac." But we can see
[1:25:46] farther than that. If there's a seed on
[1:25:48] the inside of your life, Satan cannot
[1:25:51] stop you from [snorts] coming to the
[1:25:53] recognition of who you are. Oh, brother,
[1:25:55] I'm under a different cloud. Amen. I
[1:25:58] like what brother Brandham said. He
[1:26:00] said, "I was listening to demonology and
[1:26:03] he said, "An oppression looks like a
[1:26:05] cloud." And immediately my mind went to
[1:26:08] the place that Satan is only a
[1:26:10] perverter. Amen. And he would try to
[1:26:13] make an oppression like a cloud. Amen.
[1:26:16] But I'm under a different cloud. I'm
[1:26:18] under that cloud. That brother Brandham
[1:26:20] saw appear out above Arizona and said,
[1:26:24] "That is our Lord up there. That's the
[1:26:26] cloud I'm under. Satan may oppress you
[1:26:29] and it may be above you, but I'm not
[1:26:31] under it. Oh, how's that work, Brother
[1:26:34] Isaac? It's above me, but I'm not under
[1:26:36] it because I am under the headship of
[1:26:38] this message. I am under the realization
[1:26:41] that I came from God and I'm going back
[1:26:43] to God. And there's not enough devils in
[1:26:45] hell that can stop me from coming to
[1:26:48] where I am. Oh, brother Bham said this
[1:26:51] sister had a dream that she was walking
[1:26:54] in white sands, but she was walking in
[1:26:56] darkness. And brother Brandham
[1:26:58] interpreted her. She said, "Now I'm
[1:27:00] nervous. My family is nervous. We're all
[1:27:03] nervous." And brother Bham said,
[1:27:06] "Sister, the very white sands proves
[1:27:08] that you are walking in purity and
[1:27:10] righteousness. It's only a devil that's
[1:27:12] made you nervous, and now your whole
[1:27:14] family's nervous. You see, she was under
[1:27:17] darkness, but she wasn't under the
[1:27:19] devil's rule. She was a daughter walking
[1:27:22] in purity and righteousness. And it's
[1:27:24] the lie of the devil that'll try to make
[1:27:26] you nervous and try to make you
[1:27:28] depressed and make you think that you're
[1:27:30] going to hell. But I'm telling you,
[1:27:32] young man, there is a real God that is
[1:27:35] calling you, come out of the darkness.
[1:27:37] There is a man that can turn on the
[1:27:39] light and let you know that you always
[1:27:41] were a son of God. You are not under it.
[1:27:44] You are under the identification of this
[1:27:47] word.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. Brother Bam said
[1:27:51] there's clouds of judgment forming.
[1:27:53] Amen. But we are not under the clouds of
[1:27:55] judgment. We are under a prophecy. Amen.
[1:27:58] That before those clouds can rain down
[1:28:01] in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, I
[1:28:03] will catch my bride away. Amen. The
[1:28:06] clouds have no power over your identity.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a cloud. It's a storm, but it
[1:28:13] has no power over your identity. Your
[1:28:15] future is clear. What side of the
[1:28:17] prophecy are you on? When they shall
[1:28:20] say, "Peace and safety, sudden
[1:28:22] destruction shall come." But you are not
[1:28:24] children of the darkness, that that day
[1:28:27] should overtake you as a thief. But ye
[1:28:29] are children of the light. And before
[1:28:31] darkness has its time, and when the
[1:28:34] light time has come,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; and the brightest recognized the evening
[1:28:38] light at the rising of the sun. Oh, it's
[1:28:42] the season of recognition. At the rising
[1:28:45] of the sun, black clouds are leaving.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham said, remember it
[1:28:50] was promised that the clouds would clear
[1:28:53] away in the evening time and in the
[1:28:55] evening time. Clouds have brushed back.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Clouds of formality have brushed back.
[1:29:03] Clouds of the days of miracles have
[1:29:05] passed have brush brushed back. Oh, but
[1:29:08] at the same time, brother Josh. Amen.
[1:29:11] Then he shall appear the sign of the son
[1:29:13] of man in heaven. And then shall the
[1:29:15] tribes of the earth mourn, and they
[1:29:17] shall see the son of man coming. And the
[1:29:20] clouds of heaven with power and with
[1:29:24] great glory. Oh, black clouds are
[1:29:26] leaving and clouds of power and glory
[1:29:29] are coming.
[1:29:31] Brother Brandham said John 5:24, "He
[1:29:35] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:29:37] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:29:39] and shall not come in the condemnation,
[1:29:41] but has passed from death unto life."
[1:29:43] Brother Brandham said, "Then the black
[1:29:45] clouds of death
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; has sailed from over 50 or 75 people in
[1:29:50] here tonight, and clouds of light have
[1:29:54] come to them." Oh brother, at the rising
[1:29:58] of the sun, when those seals begin to
[1:30:00] break open, clouds of darkness would
[1:30:03] begin to roll off of the church of the
[1:30:05] living God. And as they rolled away,
[1:30:07] clouds of light begin to roll over the
[1:30:10] church. Clouds of power and glory,
[1:30:12] clouds of joy and peace, clouds of
[1:30:15] prodigals coming home. Amen. The cloud,
[1:30:19] oh, it has no power over your identity.
[1:30:21] I say, let the clouds of glory roll over
[1:30:24] the church tonight. Amen. Let the
[1:30:26] shakina glory, Amen, roll over your
[1:30:29] hearts and your minds tonight. And let's
[1:30:31] have a cloud breaking service.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, because at the rising of the sun was
[1:30:38] when the emancipation proclamation was
[1:30:40] declared, where they recognized that
[1:30:42] they were free. And he which the sun has
[1:30:45] made free is free indeed. [laughter]
[1:30:48] And he is here to blow a mighty rushing
[1:30:51] wind to roll the clouds away. Why is he
[1:30:53] rolling him away, brother Carrie? So his
[1:30:56] attributes could display themselves.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. The cloud is not the
[1:31:02] attribute. The cloud is what it has to
[1:31:04] get through. But the attribute is what's
[1:31:07] laying inside. That's the real you. The
[1:31:09] attribute is the son or daughter. Oh,
[1:31:11] I've about had enough of that spirit of
[1:31:14] pressure and fear. Amen. In the
[1:31:16] building, I've about had enough. Amen.
[1:31:18] Our young sisters were created for joy.
[1:31:20] You were created to have a dance. You
[1:31:22] were created to have peace. You were
[1:31:24] created to have a sound mind. It is a
[1:31:27] devil. It is an oppression. But it is
[1:31:30] not a possession. Satan [cheering]
[1:31:32] cannot get you because God got you
[1:31:35] first. Oh, I said, "Get out of the
[1:31:37] building, Satan. There's no clouds
[1:31:39] welcome in here tonight." Amen. This is
[1:31:42] reserved for the clouds of glory. This
[1:31:45] is reserved for the son of God. Oh,
[1:31:48] Satan cannot stop you from recognizing
[1:31:51] who you are.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And I like a good storm anyway, Brother
[1:31:54] Carrie. I like the rain of his
[1:31:56] blessings. I like the lightning of his
[1:31:59] presence. I like the thunder of his
[1:32:01] voice. I like the clouds of his power
[1:32:04] and glory when they come [cheering] over
[1:32:06] your life and begin to set you free.
[1:32:09] There's joy in the house of the Lord
[1:32:11] tonight. There's joy in the presence of
[1:32:13] the Lord. Satan is defeated and the son
[1:32:16] of man has arised with healing in his
[1:32:19] wings to let you know that Satan never
[1:32:22] had you in the first place. Oh, there's
[1:32:25] joy for you. There's a fresh victory for
[1:32:28] you tonight if you can recognize it.
[1:32:31] Amen. You were never his, but you always
[1:32:33] were a son of God.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, it had a beginning. [snorts]
[1:32:39] You say, "It's just the way I am,
[1:32:40] Brother Isaac." [panting]
[1:32:43] But brother Brandham could identify. You
[1:32:45] were bit by a dog when you were just a
[1:32:47] little boy and it made you nervous your
[1:32:49] whole life. You say, "I've always been
[1:32:51] that way, Brother Isaac. It must be my
[1:32:53] nature." No, it had a beginning
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; and it will have an end.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That didn't just happen once.
[1:32:59] Brother Brandham discerned that dog
[1:33:01] biting about seven times caused
[1:33:03] nervousness. At least seven times I
[1:33:05] found a dog bit someone and it caused a
[1:33:07] nervous spirit. And you think it's your
[1:33:09] identity and you think it's the way
[1:33:11] you're always going to be. But I'm here
[1:33:12] to tell you, amen, that this message has
[1:33:14] discerned it and said, "No, it's a liar.
[1:33:17] It's a nervous spirit." And it's time
[1:33:19] that it lets you go and you recognize,
[1:33:22] amen, that it had a beginning and this
[1:33:24] is the end. Amen. It is not you. It's a
[1:33:27] cloud.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan.
[1:33:31] You're a liar.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You know, you start preaching about that
[1:33:35] though, and someone might start thinking
[1:33:38] that that that that, well, what about
[1:33:40] me? I was actually possessed.
[1:33:43] The He had me so much till he spoke
[1:33:45] through my lips.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; What about Mary Magdalene,
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Josiah? She was possessed with
[1:33:52] seven devils.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; She didn't even know she had them. She
[1:33:57] had pride. She was a strip tease. She
[1:34:00] had lust. She had all kinds of spirits.
[1:34:02] But when she met a man, he said, "Be
[1:34:04] thou clean." And when his voice spoke
[1:34:06] out, the seven devils left and she
[1:34:09] became a clean daughter of God. And that
[1:34:13] voice can still speak tonight. You see,
[1:34:15] I feel so dirty. I'm looking at things I
[1:34:17] shouldn't look at. And it's made me feel
[1:34:19] so dirty. But the voice of the Lord is
[1:34:21] still speaking tonight, saying, "Be thou
[1:34:24] clean." And the voice in whatever speaks
[1:34:27] over you, it can make you clean. Oh,
[1:34:30] glory. It didn't stop there. Amen.
[1:34:32] because she was the first one to witness
[1:34:34] him after he rose in the resurrection
[1:34:37] and then she went to the upper room to
[1:34:39] receive the Holy Ghost. You say
[1:34:41] possessed. I was possessed. I can't be
[1:34:44] bride. Mary Magdalene was. She was
[1:34:47] possessed. But then she witnessed him at
[1:34:49] his resurrection. She went to the upper
[1:34:51] room and got the Holy Ghost and she is a
[1:34:54] daughter of God.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Her name is on the lamb's book of life.
[1:34:59] Let's go.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; You say there's a woman example. We'll
[1:35:02] give you a man example.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Legion was in Geria.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; It was a man with an unclean spirit.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; You say he was an unclean man. That's
[1:35:13] not what it said.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; He said he was a man with an unclean
[1:35:16] spirit.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; You got to separate your battle from
[1:35:19] your identity.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; You say I'm depressed. No, you're not.
[1:35:22] You're a daughter with a spirit of
[1:35:25] depression attacking you. You say, "I am
[1:35:27] I'm I'm defeated." No, you're not. You
[1:35:30] say, "I'm anxious." No, you're not.
[1:35:31] You're a son, and there's a spirit
[1:35:33] trying to get come against your life.
[1:35:35] It's not the man. It's the devil that
[1:35:37] makes him do those things. But it was a
[1:35:39] man with an unclean spirit. And he was
[1:35:43] dwelling among tombs. Brother Brham
[1:35:45] said, "That's where the devils like to
[1:35:46] dwell."
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; A man, he said, "You take an unbeliever
[1:35:51] that believes the power is no longer
[1:35:53] here and the days of miracles are
[1:35:54] passed." He said, "That's a good place
[1:35:56] for the devils." He said, "But
[1:35:58] truthfully, cold, formal churches that
[1:36:01] deny the power of God," he said, "they
[1:36:03] become a hangout for devils." He said,
[1:36:05] "The colder the church gets, it becomes
[1:36:08] a hangout for the devil." And that's why
[1:36:11] Legion found himself in a graveyard
[1:36:14] cutting himself, crying out, "Oh, that
[1:36:18] cutting spirit didn't die, did it? It's
[1:36:21] still alive. It's still depression. It's
[1:36:24] still trying to make daughters cut
[1:36:26] themselves. Amen. But it's a devil. But
[1:36:29] when he saw Jesus, he ran and he
[1:36:31] worshiped him and he recognized him. Oh
[1:36:34] my my my. You mean Satan knows this
[1:36:37] message is true? Oh yeah, he does. You
[1:36:40] think those people that disbelieve the
[1:36:42] sign, the devil's got them so fooled,
[1:36:45] they're making websites about how it's
[1:36:47] false, and he knows it's true better
[1:36:49] than most Christians. Amen. Because when
[1:36:51] he was in legion and Jesus came in, he
[1:36:53] said, "Thou art the Christ." And he fell
[1:36:55] and worshiped him. He recognized him to
[1:36:58] be the son of God. And Jesus said, "What
[1:37:01] is thy name?" And he said, "Leion."
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, yeah."
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; He knew it, but he wanted them to
[1:37:08] confess it.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Cast us into the swine."
[1:37:13] How did it begin? Brother Bram said, "He
[1:37:14] took a drink and the devil came in.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; He lied and the devil came in. He did
[1:37:20] this thing and that thing and before he
[1:37:21] knew it he was legion possessed by many
[1:37:25] devils and the law couldn't help him.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Haven't we seen that?
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; The law
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; legalism couldn't help him.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Works couldn't help him.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beating him over the head. Oh
[1:37:39] glory.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saying you can't wear this. You
[1:37:42] can't do this. You can't do that. You
[1:37:44] think that would have helped Legion. You
[1:37:46] think a good 10step program was what he
[1:37:48] needed in the middle of that graveyard
[1:37:51] with the legion of devils on him? No. He
[1:37:54] needed a real God. Amen. But he wanted a
[1:37:57] revival when the rest of them didn't.
[1:38:01] Can you imagine a man possessed with the
[1:38:03] le legion of devils and he was the only
[1:38:05] one that wanted the revival?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; The rest of them didn't want it because
[1:38:09] it would cost them too much. And brother
[1:38:11] Brandon would say and that they'd rather
[1:38:13] stay in that condition than have a
[1:38:15] little wildfire because it cost them too
[1:38:18] much because they were hog farmers. And
[1:38:20] those spirits wanted to get in those
[1:38:22] hogs. Well, you know what that made me
[1:38:24] think of? Brother Brandham said these
[1:38:26] denominations trying to build their
[1:38:28] churches. He said it's like bringing
[1:38:30] more pigs to the pen and they don't want
[1:38:32] a revival because they'll lose all their
[1:38:35] pig members if they let the power of God
[1:38:37] into the church. Amen. Oh, we are not
[1:38:39] here to bring pigs to the pan. We are
[1:38:42] here to bring eagles to the carcass.
[1:38:44] That's why we let let revival come. Let
[1:38:47] the power of God fall. Let the pillar of
[1:38:50] fire sweep through the building and
[1:38:53] deliver Mary Magdalene and deliver
[1:38:56] Legion. Oh, let the revival come. We are
[1:38:59] not scared of revival. We'll pay the
[1:39:02] price. We'll throw out every dirty
[1:39:04] thing. We'll upheave every pew and every
[1:39:07] seed. Say, "God, take it out of my life.
[1:39:09] I'm ready to be free."
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a spirit.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but he met a living God. And that
[1:39:18] voice spoke and gave those evil spirits
[1:39:23] leave.
[1:39:24] And he went home, Brother Carrie.
[1:39:27] And the wife started to hide, say,
[1:39:29] "Don't do it again. Don't do it again."
[1:39:32] The children begin to scream, "No,
[1:39:35] daddy. Don't do it again."
[1:39:37] Oh God, [sighs and panting]
[1:39:41] I don't know who's here tonight. If
[1:39:42] you're in that place,
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; he said, "You might be a daddy. You
[1:39:45] might not be a legion. [panting]
[1:39:48] Maybe you're a drunk and you're home.
[1:39:51] Your wife's scared of you. Your children
[1:39:52] are scared of you.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; but when Jesus comes on the scene,
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; he can take you and change you around."
[1:40:03] And Legion was sitting there clothed and
[1:40:05] in his right mind and said, "No, come
[1:40:08] here, my son. Come here, my daughter."
[1:40:10] Oh, God.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Daddy's met Jesus.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Daddy has met Jesus. And when you meet
[1:40:22] Jesus, I don't care what condition
[1:40:24] you're in. He is a God that can take you
[1:40:27] out of your condition and save your life
[1:40:30] and fill you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:32] deliver you to be a son or daughter of
[1:40:35] God. He can take you out of drugs. He
[1:40:38] can take you out of alcohol. Is it true,
[1:40:40] Brother Kyle? Is that the kind of God we
[1:40:42] serve? Hey, he can take you out of the
[1:40:45] darkest pits and set you on the right
[1:40:47] path because when you recognize his
[1:40:50] presence, it brings hope.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Brother Bram said? that
[1:40:55] if he is present, everything is settled.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "You might be sitting here with
[1:41:00] cancer. You might be sitting here with
[1:41:02] TB. You're in a helpless condition.
[1:41:04] [laughter] You're in a hopeless
[1:41:06] condition." But Brother Bram said, "Yet
[1:41:08] to be in the presence in recognition of
[1:41:10] the presence of Jesus Christ brings hope
[1:41:13] again."
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. If you recognize his
[1:41:17] presence, it brings hope again. You've
[1:41:20] heard this testimony of Donnie Morton or
[1:41:22] I believe that's yeah Donnie Morton. He
[1:41:25] lived in Saskatchewan.
[1:41:27] He was he was four years old and they
[1:41:29] diagnosed him with a hopeless brain
[1:41:30] condition. And they went to doctor after
[1:41:33] doctor and they couldn't find any
[1:41:34] answers and he started to develop a
[1:41:36] limp. And so they said, "We've got to
[1:41:38] take him to the doctor again." And they
[1:41:40] went through the blizzards and they that
[1:41:42] just to get to the doctor and the doctor
[1:41:44] said he's got a six-month prognosis and
[1:41:47] and he's going to die. It's a hopeless
[1:41:49] brain condition. And and and and he he
[1:41:51] would stay there for observation. But
[1:41:54] but it's in Reader's Digest. I'm sure
[1:41:56] you all heard it.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They said they would not accept
[1:41:59] the word hopeless. And when Brother
[1:42:01] Brandham tells it, he tells it over and
[1:42:03] over again. His daddy would kept telling
[1:42:05] him, "We're not whipped yet, Donnie.
[1:42:08] We're not whipped yet." And his father
[1:42:10] remembered there was a man named William
[1:42:12] Marian Brandom. And in his meetings, two
[1:42:14] of his co-workers had been healed of
[1:42:16] deafness. and he said, "If I can just
[1:42:18] get to him, God will do something for my
[1:42:20] baby." So, he sold his cows and went on
[1:42:23] a 2,800 mile bus trip and arrived at the
[1:42:27] meeting 18 months after the baby was
[1:42:29] declared hopeless and they got
[1:42:31] traveler's aid to get to the meeting and
[1:42:33] they went down there and brother Brandon
[1:42:34] prayed for him and I'm sure you all
[1:42:36] remember the prayer. It was the prayer
[1:42:38] of the old country doctor saying, "If
[1:42:40] you go, you'll meet this doctor. the
[1:42:42] only hopes for this baby is the power of
[1:42:45] God in that surgery. And so they went
[1:42:47] out and they met the doctor just like he
[1:42:50] said and the baby had the surgery and
[1:42:52] the baby began to get totally well.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Now the critics might look at that and
[1:42:57] say, "Well, if you know the full story,
[1:42:59] the baby died shortly thereafter." But
[1:43:01] brother Brandon must have had a vision
[1:43:02] or something because he said that the
[1:43:05] nurses actually left the window cracked
[1:43:07] open and a draft blew in and the day the
[1:43:10] baby didn't die of the disease. He died
[1:43:12] of pneumonia and menitis. Amen. Because
[1:43:16] a daddy had enough faith to realize that
[1:43:19] there's someone on the scene that if I
[1:43:21] can just get my baby to that person,
[1:43:23] then he would be well.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham said, "I was in the
[1:43:27] Mayo Clinic, helpless, going to die. I
[1:43:31] was a helpless case. But God met me and
[1:43:34] now I weigh more than I ever did. Now
[1:43:38] I'm stronger than I've ever been. I'm
[1:43:40] healthier than I've ever been. And case
[1:43:42] after case would come through the prayer
[1:43:44] line. He would say, "It's hopeless.
[1:43:46] It's hopeless." But there's a God.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, [snorts] sir.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; That can meet you. You say, "Well, that
[1:43:51] was just for brother Brandham's day.
[1:43:54] What about our day?"
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Well, you can have the revelation that
[1:43:57] Martha had when Lazarus was in a
[1:43:59] hopeless condition.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was laying in the grave for 4
[1:44:04] days. Amen. But Martha had a revelation
[1:44:07] because she read the story of the
[1:44:08] Shounomite woman, how the baby came to
[1:44:11] life through Elijah and how the word
[1:44:14] come to the prophets. And so God was in
[1:44:16] Elijah, but it didn't stay there. But
[1:44:19] she said, "If God is in Elijah, surely
[1:44:22] he's in his son." And she said, "Even
[1:44:24] now, Lord, you can come on the scene for
[1:44:27] Lazarus." and Lazarus raised from the
[1:44:29] grave when you caught the revelation
[1:44:32] that God wasn't just with Elijah, but
[1:44:34] God is the same today. And he's with his
[1:44:37] son tonight. He's with his word tonight.
[1:44:40] He's with his message tonight. And so,
[1:44:42] we can stand here and say that there's
[1:44:44] people all through this congregation
[1:44:46] that couldn't have babies. They were
[1:44:48] hopeless, but they have babies tonight
[1:44:51] because he is still here. Amen. I've got
[1:44:54] a wife that was in a hopeless condition.
[1:44:56] The doctors didn't know what was wrong.
[1:44:58] Amen. But she's well tonight because he
[1:45:01] is still here. You say, "It looks
[1:45:03] hopeless, Brother Isaac. What will we
[1:45:04] do?" I'll tell you. We'll do like
[1:45:06] Abraham did. Against hope, we'll believe
[1:45:09] in hope. Brother Abraham said, Abraham
[1:45:11] didn't even have hope. But he had faith
[1:45:13] and hope when hope wasn't even there.
[1:45:16] Oh, glory. It may look hopeless, but you
[1:45:19] can have faith and hope when hope isn't
[1:45:22] even there. Oh, we're not whipped yet,
[1:45:24] church. We're not whipped yet. He is
[1:45:27] still here. He is still on the scene.
[1:45:30] And as long as we know he is here, it's
[1:45:32] not too late.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say it's too late, Brother
[1:45:36] Isaac. It's not too late. I don't know
[1:45:38] who told you you would not make it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you you could not
[1:45:43] take it.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you it's time that
[1:45:46] you quit. But my God said, "Wait, it
[1:45:49] ain't over yet. [cheering]
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; It ain't over till I say it's over. And
[1:45:53] as long as he's still here, I say it
[1:45:55] ain't over yet. It ain't over. As long
[1:45:59] as the presence of God is still here.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; I remember what it was like, brother
[1:46:05] Daniel. I was in a cloud of confusion.
[1:46:07] We were in the greenhouse and our pastor
[1:46:09] began to preaching on it's too late.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; It's too late. And I stand here tonight
[1:46:16] and I look at where God's brought me in
[1:46:18] five years.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; I got a wife. I got a baby. I know who I
[1:46:23] am.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I know I'm a son. I know what he called
[1:46:26] me here to do. I know the clouds have
[1:46:29] rolled away because when I thought it
[1:46:31] was too late, it wasn't too late because
[1:46:34] he is still here.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, there will come a time where it's
[1:46:38] too late. But as long as he's here, it's
[1:46:40] not too late, friends.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; If we only had 5 minutes left, that's
[1:46:44] enough. Amen. For him to come and step
[1:46:46] in on the scene and meet you where
[1:46:48] you're at and set you free. Amen. and
[1:46:52] deliver you and heal you and amen fill
[1:46:54] you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; But if you can't see he's he's here, you
[1:46:59] get discouraged.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; That's what they were doing. Cleopus
[1:47:03] Cleopus and his friend on the road to
[1:47:05] Emmas. They were discouraged.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; They were really discouraged. And Jesus
[1:47:09] was walking with them. He said, "Why are
[1:47:10] you sad?"
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Said, "Don't you know they crucified
[1:47:14] Jesus of Nazareth?
[1:47:17] And we trusted he was the one to redeem
[1:47:19] redeem Israel.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; And don't you know besides that, this is
[1:47:23] the third day.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Jesus. Oh, but don't you know
[1:47:28] what Hosea prophesied?
[1:47:30] This is the third day. You think it's
[1:47:33] hopeless,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; but this is when recognition is going to
[1:47:36] come
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; in the third day.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; And he began to break the scriptures
[1:47:40] open to them. And they begin to have
[1:47:43] their eyes open and realize who he was
[1:47:46] as he expounded the scriptures to him.
[1:47:48] And I say, "This is the third day.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Hope has returned. He is here. My
[1:47:55] ministry is to declare him. He is here.
[1:47:58] I must decrease, but he must increase.
[1:48:00] Lo, I will be with you always. I will
[1:48:03] never leave you nor forsake you." Just
[1:48:05] as the legions came to possess a man.
[1:48:08] Brother Brandham said, "Does legions
[1:48:10] come to the righteous?" He said, "Yes,
[1:48:11] they do. The angels shall be encamped
[1:48:14] round about him about them that fear him
[1:48:16] and believe him." That's why brother
[1:48:17] Brandham could say, "Let not your hearts
[1:48:19] be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe
[1:48:22] also in me."
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; And he began to tie that to his
[1:48:25] ministry. He said, "You know what the
[1:48:26] angel told me?
[1:48:28] If you can get the people to believe
[1:48:30] you, nothing will stand in the way, not
[1:48:33] even cancer." He said, "You believe God,
[1:48:36] that's good. That's what you're supposed
[1:48:38] to do. He said, "But you could believe
[1:48:39] God and not believe this and it wouldn't
[1:48:41] do you any good. You must believe this
[1:48:44] if you want hope for your life." They
[1:48:46] couldn't swallow that there was somebody
[1:48:49] possessing that man. They couldn't
[1:48:51] swallow that the angel was present in
[1:48:53] their midst. They couldn't swallow that
[1:48:55] Jesus had returned in the ministry of a
[1:48:58] man named William Brandon. Brother
[1:48:59] Brandon was preaching a meeting on the
[1:49:01] Holy Ghost and he said, "Blessed is he
[1:49:03] that believeth." He said, "For two or
[1:49:04] three days, blessed is he that
[1:49:06] believeth." It said, "Then inspiration
[1:49:08] spoke. Blessed is he that cometh in the
[1:49:11] name of the Lord." He said, "Before I
[1:49:12] knew it, things begin to speak again.
[1:49:15] Blessed is he that believes the Lord has
[1:49:17] come in this." Oh, glory. You're blessed
[1:49:20] to believe God. You're blessed to
[1:49:22] believe a historical God. Oh, but you
[1:49:24] are blessed if you believe the God that
[1:49:26] has come in this message.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You let not your hearts troubled. You
[1:49:31] believe in God, believe also in me. And
[1:49:33] because you believe this message, hope
[1:49:36] has returned to your situation. Oh, when
[1:49:39] you recognize the presence of God, his
[1:49:41] power is released onto you. If it's not
[1:49:44] recognized, Brother Elijah, it's held in
[1:49:46] a bottle. But when the woman at the well
[1:49:48] recognized him, it released deliverance.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; When the woman with the blood issue
[1:49:53] recognized him, it released healing.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; When the woman, Amen, that washed his
[1:49:57] feet recognized him, it released joy and
[1:50:00] it released forgiveness. And when Hattie
[1:50:02] Wright recognized this message to be the
[1:50:04] truth and said it's nothing but the
[1:50:06] truth, it released the power to save her
[1:50:10] children. Because when you recognize,
[1:50:12] Amen, that God is still here, it
[1:50:15] releases power.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, his power is releasing even during
[1:50:20] this service as sons and daughters are
[1:50:21] recognizing power is being released to
[1:50:24] deliver you, to heal you, to set you
[1:50:27] free, and to raise you out of your
[1:50:30] condition. and blessed are your eyes for
[1:50:32] they see and your ears for they hear.
[1:50:36] Oh, as you begin to recognize him, you
[1:50:39] say, "Oh, God, thank you for your
[1:50:40] grace."
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Because I'll tell you another thing
[1:50:43] recognition brings. It brings worship.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus rode in fulfilling
[1:50:48] that word
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; on that donkey,
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; they begin to say, "Hosana.
[1:50:53] Hosana. Blessed is he that cometh in the
[1:50:56] name of the Lord. Hosana." And brother
[1:50:58] Brandham said, "There was a divided
[1:50:59] opinion that day because the scribes and
[1:51:01] Pharisees said, "Who is this? What is
[1:51:04] all this shouting about?" And the
[1:51:06] disciples said, "Don't you know that
[1:51:08] scripture must be fulfilled by
[1:51:09] Zachchariah that he would come into the
[1:51:12] city riding on that white donkey, riding
[1:51:15] on the vindicated word?" And the
[1:51:17] children begin to cry, "Hosana." And the
[1:51:19] scribe said, "What are you crying about?
[1:51:22] What are you doing?" And the disciples
[1:51:23] said, "The reason that we're so excited
[1:51:26] is because this scripture has been
[1:51:28] fulfilled." And the scribe said, "Who is
[1:51:30] this? Why are these children crying?"
[1:51:33] And he was sore displeased. But Jesus
[1:51:35] said, and he quoted to them the book of
[1:51:37] Psalms, "Don't you know that out of the
[1:51:39] mouth of babes and sucklings, praise is
[1:51:42] perfected." Oh, so you can call me a
[1:51:45] holy roller if you want to. You can call
[1:51:47] me a bubble dancer if you want to. But I
[1:51:50] have recognized that Jesus has returned
[1:51:53] in the message of the hour. I have
[1:51:55] recognized that hope has returned. Hope
[1:51:58] for a rapture. Hope for a body change.
[1:52:01] Hope for my children to be saved has
[1:52:04] come riding into the camp. I say hosana.
[1:52:07] Hosana.
[1:52:09] How could you recognize without
[1:52:10] worshiping
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; when John saw his name on the book? He
[1:52:15] said, "Heaven and earth heard I John
[1:52:18] saying blessing and honor and glory and
[1:52:20] power." And he said, "I've seen jumping
[1:52:22] spells and joy spells, but I didn't see
[1:52:24] anything wrong because it was in a
[1:52:26] meeting like that where people were
[1:52:28] recognizing that their name was on the
[1:52:30] Lamb's book of life." Oh, and don't
[1:52:34] rejoice because demons are subject to
[1:52:36] you, but rejoice that your name is
[1:52:38] written in heaven. I say recognition
[1:52:41] brings worship. We have not failed to
[1:52:43] recognize who is in our midst. We have
[1:52:46] not failed to recognize that Jesus
[1:52:49] Christ has returned today and he is
[1:52:51] here. Amen. We recognize him. That's why
[1:52:54] we worship him. That's why the woman at
[1:52:56] the well could say, "Come see a man
[1:52:58] who's told me the very things that I've
[1:53:00] done."
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; And she worshiped and she praised him.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; We don't praise because our identity is
[1:53:10] not based on our praise.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Our praise is based on our identity
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; because we recognized
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; who we are.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; What greater recognition could there be?
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Than to recognize him.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; What greater recognition could there be?
[1:53:29] See, that's what the second poll came
[1:53:31] for.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; We could recognize the devil.
[1:53:35] We could recognize Christ is here.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; But that as that third poll begin to
[1:53:40] come.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; We begin to recognize.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Who are we?
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Where did we come from?
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; And where are we going?
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, and brother Brandon begin to preach.
[1:53:55] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:53:57] This great mystery which is Christ in
[1:53:59] you the hope of glory.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Christ in you makes you the center of
[1:54:03] the whole revelation.
[1:54:06] Well,
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; you begin to recognize your position in
[1:54:08] the word.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew the word written about him.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; That's why without a shadow of a doubt,
[1:54:16] he could go to Calvary because he knew
[1:54:19] the word said that you can destroy this
[1:54:21] temple and within three days I will
[1:54:23] raise it up.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; And when you recognize who you are,
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, you can go through every trial
[1:54:29] and every heartache because you know the
[1:54:31] word that's written over you.
[1:54:34] They shall overcome them by the blood of
[1:54:36] the lamb and the word of their
[1:54:37] testimony.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; The wise shall do exploits in that day.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Greater works than these shall you do.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Recognizing what part of the word you
[1:54:47] are.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Because brother Bram said, "If ye abide
[1:54:52] in me and my word and you ask what you
[1:54:55] will,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; are you in Christ?"
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that believeth in me, he said,
[1:55:01] "Not on me, in me." Yeah.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; These works shall you do.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; If you're in me,
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; And if you recognize your position, you
[1:55:13] recognize Satan's position is under your
[1:55:15] feet tonight.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Said you got too much fear. You don't
[1:55:19] know who you are.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; But as you begin to recognize who you
[1:55:22] are, you'll recognize Satan is defeated.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; He's a liar.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; He's got a bow and no arrows.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is, we are dealing with a
[1:55:31] defeated devil. Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And when the bride finally recognizes,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; so when she realizes her position, then
[1:55:39] the rapture will go. When she recognizes
[1:55:41] who she is,
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; he knows your name tonight.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what [sighs]
[1:55:47] after Peter said, "Thou art the Christ,"
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; the Lord would speak back to him, "Thou
[1:55:52] art Peter.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Your name's no longer Simon. I call you
[1:55:56] Peter."
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And when Jacob had an experience with
[1:56:00] the angel,
[1:56:02] Amen. He would speak back, "What is your
[1:56:05] name?" He said, "Jacob." He said, "Your
[1:56:08] name shall no longer be called Jacob. It
[1:56:11] shall be called Israel."
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I say, "What is your name
[1:56:16] tonight?"
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; What is your name?
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Your name is bride.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jesus knew what Legion's
[1:56:29] name was, but he wanted them to confess
[1:56:31] it.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this message knows who you
[1:56:35] are, but it's waiting for you to confess
[1:56:38] it.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm no longer anxious. I'm no longer
[1:56:42] defeated. I'm no longer depressed. My
[1:56:45] name is no longer, Amen, this disease or
[1:56:48] that disease. My name is bride. My name
[1:56:51] is Mrs. Jesus Christ. Amen. As you begin
[1:56:54] to recognize that, it begins to put an
[1:56:57] authority in your life.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what's it like? Brother
[1:57:02] Troy, brother tells that story about
[1:57:03] that boy in the mirror. He said he got
[1:57:05] to wandering around playing in the house
[1:57:07] one day and the first time he saw
[1:57:10] himself in that mirror.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why mama? That's me."
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Brother Brandham
[1:57:18] beginning to recognize himself in the
[1:57:20] scripture for the first time?
[1:57:23] Wow.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; As he's riding with brother Ed Bisco in
[1:57:26] the car, he says, "Brother Ed,
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; do you think that this could be the
[1:57:29] ministry of Elijah?
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Do you think?"
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; And he begins to take him through all
[1:57:34] the scriptures.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; And brother Ed would say,
[1:57:38] he would say, "You know, I just it has
[1:57:42] all the means. It has all the identity
[1:57:44] of being that, Brother Brandham."
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; And that angel begin to settle into that
[1:57:48] car.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:51] But what about the first time you begin
[1:57:53] to look
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; you begin to open that message book
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; and you begin to read
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; you begin to say, "Could it be?"
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Could it be, Brother Levi? Could it be?
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I thought this was a good story, but
[1:58:09] could it be this is my story?
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Could it be this is my rapture?
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Could it be this is my body change?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Could it be? You begin to read, "Since
[1:58:20] you was a little boy, you was always
[1:58:22] different than those other kids." Say,
[1:58:25] "Well, that one checks off."
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe more ways than one. [panting]
[1:58:32] And you begin to read, "You were
[1:58:34] desperate for the birthight."
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; That checks off.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; You begin to read and the more you read,
[1:58:40] like brother Brandham in the prayer
[1:58:41] lines, he begin to describe them and
[1:58:43] describe them and say, "Will it help you
[1:58:44] if I tell you who you are?"
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; There you go. And you be this message
[1:58:48] begin to describe you and they said
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; so that it'll help you. I'll call you
[1:58:54] bride.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; This is who you are.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; This is what it's all about. This is
[1:58:59] your position.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; So that you might understand
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; you are my bride.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Would you stand to your feet tonight?
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said
[1:59:14] that's the reason you enjoy it. You
[1:59:16] Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, and
[1:59:17] Presbyterians and so forth enjoy that
[1:59:19] presence. Somewhere in you, you've
[1:59:22] accepted God.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe sometime in an intellectual way,
[1:59:26] you felt the power of God and you are a
[1:59:28] servant of God. But when you can really
[1:59:30] come into God and recognize your place
[1:59:34] in him as a son or daughter of God,
[1:59:36] that's what brings that great thrill to
[1:59:39] you that God intended you to have.
[1:59:42] And if you've ever found that thrill,
[1:59:45] brother, it's my desire for every person
[1:59:48] in this world to get that thrill
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; to recognize who you are,
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; to recognize
[1:59:57] who your enemy is and to recognize that
[1:59:59] he is here.
[2:00:01] Brother Brandham said,
[2:00:04] "If we could only do that tonight,
[2:00:06] people, if we could only realize that he
[2:00:08] is appearing to us in these meetings for
[2:00:10] one purpose." Can that be these meetings
[2:00:13] this weekend?
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; For one purpose, that's to release our
[2:00:20] desires that we have in him to us.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; I believe he's appearing in these
[2:00:26] meetings for one purpose.
[2:00:29] that to those who look for him, he shall
[2:00:31] appear
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; and release the desires of your heart
[2:00:34] unto you.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; What's your desire this weekend? You
[2:00:38] say, "I desire the Holy Ghost, Brother
[2:00:39] Isaac.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; I desire to have my joy back. I desire
[2:00:43] to have my peace back.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; I desire fresh revival in my life. I
[2:00:48] desire more revelation.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's here?" Amen.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Then I believe he's here to release
[2:00:55] those desires onto you.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you desire.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Ask what you will and it shall be given
[2:01:03] unto you.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing.

[2:25:08] [applause]
[2:25:09] Hallelujah.
[2:25:12] Brother, I'm not under no cloud and
[2:25:14] depression.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; I don't live under no cloud in
[2:25:16] neurotics. I live under a pillar of
[2:25:19] fire, the cloud of the day. Amen. Well,
[2:25:22] I I tell you, somebody said, "Well, that
[2:25:24] pillar of fire now that that that don't
[2:25:26] that don't appear over the head of the
[2:25:27] men of God, the last day." Well, you
[2:25:29] know, I thank God we've got a message.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; I thank God we got a message. You know
[2:25:34] how many times, Brother Bannon seen that
[2:25:36] pillar of fire over people?
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; And if he was here tonight, he could
[2:25:40] tell you, he could tell you that it's
[2:25:41] right here in this building. And he'd
[2:25:43] say, "I see it right there, and I see it
[2:25:45] over that head. I said don't. Amen.
[2:25:47] Because he's still alive.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. His name is Jesus
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; and he's still alive tonight.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; He's here to empower you as a believer
[2:25:57] to to come over you to get over your
[2:25:59] head. I always loved it that when when
[2:26:02] the when the angel of the Lord, [music]
[2:26:04] our Lord Jesus, took a picture with
[2:26:05] brother Brandham, he didn't he he he he
[2:26:08] didn't appear under his foot. He didn't
[2:26:11] appear, you know, under his arm,
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; but he appeared over his head.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he had superior authority.
[2:26:19] And that's the way he appears today.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; And and and isn't it beautiful that he
[2:26:24] comes right over your thinking?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; He comes right over the way you develop
[2:26:28] your mind, the way you think about
[2:26:29] [music] things, the way you think about
[2:26:31] yourself. That great Holy Spirit would
[2:26:33] come right in here and do that tonight.
[2:26:34] You know, I I I I so appreciated the man
[2:26:37] of God tonight [music]
[2:26:39] to separate the unclean spirit from the
[2:26:42] man.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; That was a man with an unclean spirit.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my my goodness. Cuz because you know
[2:26:49] what? There's a power here tonight that
[2:26:51] can un remove every unclean spirit.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; He can remove everything that that is
[2:26:56] not a part of that original identity.
[2:26:58] God never created a fallen son.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; He created sons. And those sons are
[2:27:04] alive tonight. His mercy is coming to
[2:27:07] this place. You know, uh years ago, we
[2:27:09] were we're reading something. Brother
[2:27:10] Ram said this. It's it's just so
[2:27:12] powerful is brother Ram is discerning
[2:27:15] and he comes across two women sitting in
[2:27:17] his meeting and one of them has hay
[2:27:19] fever. And brother Bam discerns the
[2:27:21] woman, calls her by name, and says to
[2:27:23] the sister, "You're suffering with hay
[2:27:24] fever. You're sitting there." And he
[2:27:26] says, "Now, in the name of Jesus, you're
[2:27:28] healed." And he said, "But now I [music]
[2:27:31] I need you to do something for me."
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to lay your hand on
[2:27:35] the sister sitting next to you. She's
[2:27:37] suffering the same thing."
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; And when she laid her hand on her
[2:27:42] sister, Brother Bram said, "There it
[2:27:44] is." He said, "I see it now. Something
[2:27:46] white moving in, shoving that thing
[2:27:49] away."
[2:27:51] And you know, whether you can see it
[2:27:53] with your eyes or not,
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; that's [music] exactly what happens when
[2:27:56] the word of God begins to be ministered
[2:27:58] over a congregation, the spirit of God
[2:28:01] gets behind that old oppressive thing
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; and just begins to push it right out of
[2:28:06] your mind and right out of your life.
[2:28:08] Amen. And and you could say, "I see it.
[2:28:11] There it goes. There it goes."
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; You know, when you get tired of getting
[2:28:15] pushed around, it's time to push back.
[2:28:18] You say, "How do I push back tonight?"
[2:28:20] Brother Wayne, you worship God.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; You just begin to let his Holy Spirit
[2:28:24] move into that being and something
[2:28:26] wonderful begins to happen. I'll tell
[2:28:28] you friends, what a tremendous beginning
[2:28:30] to a meeting tonight. Amen. I I I so
[2:28:33] appreciated the the word of God.
[2:28:35] Inspiration is real, folks.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Inspiration's real. Brother Ronnie
[2:28:39] and I sit and talked about some of these
[2:28:41] very things just before the meeting
[2:28:42] tonight. and the Holy Spirit just it's
[2:28:44] so real
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; that that spirit of God can just come
[2:28:47] right in the building. Uh brother
[2:28:49] Jonathan and I sat and talked just
[2:28:51] yesterday about a couple of these issues
[2:28:53] and and praying and asking God, we need
[2:28:56] the certain thing. And if the Holy
[2:28:58] Spirit didn't pick up our conversation
[2:29:00] and begin to deal directly with the
[2:29:02] situations and how that he can handle
[2:29:04] it, there is no problem too big for our
[2:29:06] God.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; There is no sickness he cannot heal.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; There's no trouble he cannot dissipate.
[2:29:12] There's no darkness that his sunlight
[2:29:14] cannot move back off of you. Amen. He
[2:29:16] He's a merciful God tonight. And we're
[2:29:18] we're so thankful for him and what he's
[2:29:21] done for us. Amen. I I certainly believe
[2:29:23] that tonight. Amen. I I certainly
[2:29:25] believe his mercy and his and his truth
[2:29:27] is real. We want to thank each of you
[2:29:30] for coming out tonight. We begin
[2:29:31] tomorrow night again at 6:00. Amen. You
[2:29:34] uh if you would just be in prayer for
[2:29:36] the meeting, Brother Ronnie will be
[2:29:38] speaking. And so we just ask God to
[2:29:40] [music] he would move over on behalf of
[2:29:41] the people. Amen. I know the I know the
[2:29:44] Lord Amen. moves among us. Brother
