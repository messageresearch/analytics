[9:43] have a testimony here from Brother David
[9:45] Evans it says thank the Lord I passed
[9:48] kidney stones this week I got through
[9:50] two surgeries over the past two
[9:52] months and due to my present condition I
[9:56] give thanks to God that I can do once
[9:58] again forward to my responsibilities and
[10:01] obligations that I have been given in
[10:02] this world was it for the grace of God
[10:05] that put me in a POS in a position of
[10:07] suffering that I could better understand
[10:09] what others have endured even the
[10:11] suffering of Our Lord I can only imagine
[10:14] that Christ endured 33 years of
[10:16] suffering in his flesh to have the
[10:18] character to lay down his life for his
[10:21] church in our society many or most of us
[10:24] rely on someone else to grow and raise
[10:27] our food sometimes we are exposed to
[10:29] things that eventually lead us lead us
[10:32] down a path that leads to conditions in
[10:34] our flesh we would rather not think
[10:36] about we all have responsibility to be
[10:38] extremely careful how we live I am so
[10:40] grateful for medicine technology that
[10:42] can preserve and save lives many of the
[10:45] faithful Warriors in this assembly know
[10:49] what it is to stand firm in their faith
[10:51] when it seems like their whole world was
[10:53] being torn apart they stood and still
[10:55] stand as a testimony of the grace of God
[10:58] to be test said we are witnessing the
[11:00] word and during the battle we all face
[11:04] in this life I thank God Almighty for
[11:06] the opportunity to be a witness at the
[11:08] hospital where I continue to volunteer
[11:10] and meet people there in needs in need
[11:13] and suffering I have compassion to
[11:16] listen and lead them to the waters that
[11:18] we drink from I thank God for each of
[11:20] you especially those who are willing to
[11:21] trust me in all my human flaws accepting
[11:24] my desire for Fellowship I know I need
[11:27] your love thank you we all must say that

[33:51] downhill um you realize that there's
[33:53] only so much that medical science can do
[33:56] for a child
[33:58] and you really need the Holy Spirit to
[34:00] to move in and make a difference and and

[34:32] need of our savior you
[34:35] know and it there was just such a
[34:38] presence came in that room just
[34:41] sovereignly I wasn't even really praying
[34:44] I was just sitting there meditating and
[34:46] it's just like he walked in the room and
[34:48] the Holy Spirit began to tell me that
[34:51] it's going to change now and it was such
[34:54] a presence that came and I I knew right
[34:56] then that there had been a turn of a
[34:59] corner and you know it may take 2 or
[35:02] three days for that to really manifest
[35:04] itself and you really see it but it's
[35:06] that moment when change happens and you
[35:09] know and I I pray this morning as we're
[35:11] setting in the service I pray that that
[35:13] presence that same presence maybe
[35:15] there's a need in your life or a
[35:17] situation I pray that when he moves
[35:18] through here this morning it's something

[46:21] for a long time and uh this is the first
[46:24] time I've got to meet Brother Ray though
[46:27] I've known of Brother Ray over the years
[46:29] every time my dad would come home from
[46:31] from Ohio he'd say oh my he' just give
[46:34] me all the stories and tell them how
[46:35] much he just loved everybody here and
[46:36] the families and brother Ray and the
[46:38] family and and I finally finally got the
[46:41] opportunity to be here and uh you know
[46:45] if I could say this and forgive me for
[46:47] being a little bit at home a little bit
[46:49] here and just you know I think of
[46:52] Brother Ray and through all the years
[46:54] you know I didn't know him personally
[46:56] but I know of him the family but you
[46:59] know if I could say brother R is like
[47:02] the just the epitome of the message if I
[47:05] could say that because you know not
[47:09] through the course of life through the
[47:10] course of circumstance through the
[47:12] course of all many different challenges
[47:14] and such but Brother Ray you just stood
[47:16] steady all the way
[47:17] through you know and that's the strength
[47:19] to us younger Generations that can see
[47:22] that when the word strikes the soul it
[47:25] really don't matter what happens what
[47:27] comes what goes and so you're just so
[47:29] blessed to have Heritage like that here
[47:32] and then to have brother Wayne come in
[47:34] behind now and continue that Vision
[47:36] onward I just say don't take it for
[47:38] granted Saints you got something very
[47:40] precious very precious here you rally
[47:43] around the word and we'll go on right to
[47:46] Rapture just right around the corner and
[47:49] so I just want to thank you for giving
[47:50] me the opportunity to be here take a
[47:53] part of the little service last night at
[47:55] the Young people's at the banquet just a
[47:58] wonderful presence that was there I pray
[48:00] something was deposited uh into your
[48:03] heart and all the effort and work but
[48:05] Nathan all that you've done uh it's
[48:08] burden it's burden God places the
[48:12] burden and uh some when it gets really
[48:14] difficult the difficult time the burden
[48:16] keeps you through it's that desire to
[48:18] see young
[48:19] ones get a real walk with the
[48:22] Lord amen and so we're just honored to
[48:25] be able to come behind that burden and
[48:27] maybe just support a little bit here
[48:29] this morning so we thank you we're going
[48:31] to turn to the scripture I could sing
[48:33] some more but we we
[48:35] won't we'll go right to the
[48:39] word I I also like a good amen that's
[48:43] okay you won't scare me
[48:46] neither we to see how the Lord moves but
[48:50] uh we'll just try
[48:53] and fellowship around the world a little
[48:55] bit we're going to turn to First
[48:56] Chronicles 13 5 and 12
[49:13] 5-2 part of the scripture that we
[49:17] know well the story I should say I'm
[49:20] going to try and weave a little thought
[49:22] I if I have to make some pivots I'm just
[49:24] trying to maybe circle around a thought
[49:25] maybe not so linear but maybe in a
[49:27] circle so we'll take a little thought
[49:29] and we'll go this way and then we'll go
[49:30] that way and then we'll go this way and
[49:31] that way we'll see how see how the Lord
[49:33] leads us this
[49:35] morning amen we'll turn to First
[49:37] Chronicles there we'll read so David
[49:40] gathered all Israel together from sheor
[49:43] of Egypt even unto the entering of Heth
[49:45] to bring the Ark of God from now that's
[49:49] quite the word I practiced it at home
[49:52] but uh or in the hotel and it didn't
[49:54] maybe even help me k k Jam how's that
[49:57] did I catch it I won't say it twice and
[50:01] David went up and all Israel to Bala
[50:04] that is to
[50:05] kjam which belonged to Judah to bring up
[50:08] then the Ark of God the Lord which that
[50:10] dwelleth between the cherums whose name
[50:12] is called on it and they carried the ark
[50:15] and They Carried the Ark of God in a new
[50:17] card out of the house of abinadab and
[50:20] Aza and a drave the cart and David and
[50:23] all Israel played before God with all
[50:25] their might and with singing and with
[50:27] Harps and sues with timberl and symbols
[50:30] and with trumpets and when they came
[50:32] unto the threshing floor of chidon Aza
[50:35] put forth his hand to hold the ark for
[50:38] The Oxen stumbled and the anger of the
[50:40] Lord was kindled against Aza and he
[50:42] smote him because he put his hand to the
[50:44] ark and there he died before the Lord
[50:47] and David was displeased because the
[50:49] Lord had made a breach upon Aza
[50:51] wherefore the place is called perah
[50:54] peris Aza unto this day and David Avid
[50:56] was afraid of God that day saying how
[50:59] shall I bring the Ark of God home to me
[51:03] amen let's just have a word of
[51:08] prayer Heavenly
[51:11] Father Lord we are so
[51:13] desirous that Lord you Minister this
[51:15] morning to your
[51:17] people Lord I look from my far left to
[51:20] my far
[51:21] right Lord each one of your precious
[51:23] sons and daughters are here Lord their
[51:26] desire ing Lord to hear from you and you
[51:28] alone so Lord I pray that you open Lord
[51:32] these scriptures Lord and you would take
[51:34] the words from the page bring them to
[51:37] life to your people that Lord their
[51:39] souls might be fed not by words of man
[51:42] but by words Lord that come from the
[51:44] very heart and Throne of God so I commit
[51:47] this service and each one here today in
[51:50] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[51:53] amen you may have your seats
[51:58] I heard that list of ministers that were
[52:00] here this morning I said dear goodness
[52:01] what am I doing up
[52:03] here surely someone else that could have
[52:05] been preaching
[52:06] but as I as better Wayne said I I guess
[52:09] we got a handful of amens out there
[52:11] that's for
[52:12] certain at least I sure hope
[52:16] so amen bit of a scripture we we we know
[52:19] the story maybe some have heard the read
[52:21] this of course maybe in Sunday school
[52:23] even and we we know this the uh the
[52:26] story of Aza and the cart and I just
[52:28] want to focus on verse seven there and
[52:30] they Carri the Ark of God in a new cart
[52:32] and I want to just take a little subject
[52:34] this morning called beyond the carrier
[52:37] beyond the carrier and if the Lord would
[52:39] just allow me to move in a certain
[52:41] direction but a carrier in this case was
[52:43] a a new idea or a method a new method to
[52:46] carry the word of God and the Ark of the
[52:48] Covenant was being presented and David
[52:50] he had this idea that he was going to uh
[52:53] you know carry the The Ark in a new way
[52:55] and you know at the end the day why
[52:57] would it really matter uh you know what
[52:59] was what what was carrying it as long as
[53:01] as God was with his people as long as it
[53:03] was the ark you know who who really
[53:05] thought and maybe David didn't really
[53:07] think too much about what what was
[53:08] carrying the Ark of the Covenant you
[53:11] know what what did it really matter but
[53:12] to God it actually mattered a lot it
[53:15] mattered a big deal to him as something
[53:17] that was carrying the the Ark of the
[53:18] Covenant Covenant and and and and and
[53:21] the Cherub them The Mercy Seat there it
[53:23] mattered so specifically so intensely to
[53:26] God he it he he he wanted staves of wood
[53:28] he had stated in Exodus it was staves of
[53:31] wood overlaid with gold on the shoulders
[53:33] of Kath because it says there but Unto
[53:35] the Sons of Kath he gave none because of
[53:38] the service of the sanctuary belonging
[53:40] unto them was that they should bear upon
[53:42] the shoulders not a wagon not some other
[53:45] Contraption not some new idea not some
[53:48] some understanding from some other man
[53:49] or somewhere God had decreed in his word
[53:52] a very specific way to carry his word
[53:55] and so God cares about the carrier all
[53:59] right God cares about it it's very
[54:00] important to him and and today and and
[54:02] you might think and I digress a little
[54:05] bit but is it Super
[54:08] Bowl it's clearing that
[54:11] off I did not know that I was I was
[54:13] preparing just some just the direction
[54:16] of the Lord and and uh and so as I just
[54:18] go maybe into this next little part here
[54:20] somebody's carrying a ball
[54:22] today but we're going to talk about a
[54:24] different carrier all right but I know
[54:26] that's that's maybe on the world's mind
[54:28] today and football's a big deal but I I
[54:30] I stumbled upon that uh after I thought
[54:33] oh dear they're going to think I'm
[54:34] preaching this because of Super Bowl
[54:35] that is not the case all right just
[54:38] clear that out of the way right here
[54:40] right now cuz I'm from Canada and it
[54:42] don't mean nothing and we don't it don't
[54:44] mean
[54:45] nothing
[54:46] so Lord has maybe a sense of
[54:49] humor and it's sent in way there but
[54:52] anyways carrying the ball is a big deal
[54:55] on the fields of your football field
[54:56] here you know and and so it's it's a big
[54:59] deal when someone's carrying the ball we
[55:00] use that statement because someone's
[55:02] leading on a project maybe they're kind
[55:03] of carrying you carrying the the the the
[55:06] responsibility of it or the command of
[55:08] it you know let car to carry something
[55:09] so often the bulk carrier can often be a
[55:12] coveted position yeah right somebody
[55:15] wants everybody they kind of you know
[55:16] that want to be that one that's carrying
[55:18] the ball or I've got it or you know but
[55:20] unfortunately the carrier also takes the
[55:22] heat he also takes the heat when
[55:23] something goes wrong he's the one with
[55:24] the hot potato and he wants unloaded but
[55:26] you can't do that you're the ball
[55:27] carrier you got to take both the good
[55:29] and the bad all right and so often that
[55:31] that happens but every important I know
[55:33] in football every position's important
[55:35] and and I'm not going to go too deep
[55:37] because I would show my ignorance on the
[55:39] sport but you know I know you've got
[55:40] your defensive line and you got your QB
[55:43] and all of that but if you didn't have
[55:44] your defense your QB's toast right
[55:46] that's how it works it's and so it's a
[55:47] team effort but yet there is still
[55:49] somebody that's carrying the ball right
[55:51] you know no one everybody you don't
[55:54] select somebody that is incap able of
[55:57] carrying right right you don't select
[55:59] nobody that can is a fumbler I can tell
[56:01] you if you're a ball fumbler and all
[56:03] that I guess what do they call it five
[56:04] points of contact you know you got to
[56:05] keep your hands or hold it just right or
[56:07] whatever and M masterfully able to to
[56:10] ensure that ball is carried across the
[56:12] the line there I can tell you there
[56:13] people are are made specifically I'm not
[56:16] a defenseman yeah you see my frame
[56:21] yeah no you got some big defenseman out
[56:24] there you know the the 68 610 38 85 you
[56:26] know 410 lbs that ain't me I'm not that
[56:29] guy you know and and and in hockey or
[56:32] something like that we you know you got
[56:34] the guy that can carry the puck he's
[56:35] built or he's made or he's got the skill
[56:37] set or he's trained to carry the ball or
[56:41] carry the puck or whatever sport you
[56:42] want to deal with there right so I
[56:44] should say the carrier matters and
[56:47] brother brandham says when you're
[56:48] playing a ball game and it's football
[56:50] season again this was this was before I
[56:52] even knew it was uh Super Bowl Sunday
[56:54] the thing we want to do is not everybody
[56:55] trying to take the ball away from the
[56:57] man that's got it he's trying to guard
[56:59] that man protect him let him get through
[57:01] we're trying to make a goal he says but
[57:03] imagine a team so untrained is find to
[57:06] find one man their own man with the ball
[57:07] run into the field and then instead of
[57:09] trying to knock the enemy away from the
[57:11] opposing team to let your own man that's
[57:13] got the ball to take take off with it
[57:15] and every man trying to take the ball
[57:16] out of his Hound his hand you're bound
[57:18] to lose all right he said let's use our
[57:21] influences as
[57:23] tackles am man let's use our influences
[57:25] as tackles he says not Runners tackles
[57:28] that protect the runner let's pack him
[57:31] let let him pack the ball through
[57:33] because there's no opposition amen we're
[57:35] here to whoever's carrying the ball you
[57:37] want to push him through you want to
[57:39] block for him you want to you want to be
[57:40] that wall for him amen he says many time
[57:42] in a church a little church can have a
[57:44] Revival someone will want to get out
[57:45] there and lead a prayer meeting and then
[57:47] he's got a different idea from what
[57:48] really the Bible says but he leaves it
[57:50] this way and he'll start an influence
[57:52] and draw others away from it that's not
[57:54] what we're supposed to do we're supposed
[57:55] to get behind the leadership of the word
[57:58] and blocking it in our influences and
[57:59] what we can it's a body of Believers
[58:02] amen it's a team and we're blockers
[58:03] we're kickers we're run backers whatever

[1:01:19] little baby life that is the most
[1:01:22] precious thing such care is there when
[1:01:24] you have a little stuffed doll I'm
[1:01:25] telling you if it drops on the ground

[1:01:32] that and and a mother to be is pregnant
[1:01:35] she's carrying
[1:01:37] life amen but what is defining what is
[1:01:42] life what is that Define that for me
[1:01:46] well I'll Define that for you all right
[1:01:49] defining what is life well to man life
[1:01:53] has certain defining properties it's got
[1:01:56] organization living things are highly
[1:01:58] organized one or more cells with
[1:02:00] different functions living organisms
[1:02:02] have a metabolism and they use energy to
[1:02:05] consume nutrients and carry out the
[1:02:07] chemical reactions that sustain life
[1:02:09] living things have homeostasis they have
[1:02:12] they regulate their internal environment
[1:02:13] to maintain a relatively narrow range of
[1:02:16] conditions your body is continually
[1:02:19] regulating a very narrow uh narrow realm
[1:02:22] and range of conditions a living
[1:02:24] organism's got the growth it grows and
[1:02:26] it regulates it it reproduces and has a
[1:02:29] reproduction uh mechanism it has a
[1:02:31] response and so it can show irritability
[1:02:33] and how to respond to stimuli and a
[1:02:35] living organism is evolves as well its
[1:02:38] genetic makeup it allows for changes as
[1:02:41] it goes or under goes a change in in his
[1:02:44] genes as he over time that's that is the
[1:02:47] properties of life to man all right but
[1:02:52] who gave
[1:02:54] life you man can Define life and say
[1:02:57] well here's the properties that that can
[1:02:59] Define it here's here's how we can can
[1:03:02] you know this does not have the defining
[1:03:04] properties of life it doesn't have cells
[1:03:06] it doesn't make itself up it it can't
[1:03:08] reproduce itself it doesn't have life in
[1:03:10] it and so man can can design or can can
[1:03:13] understand that's not living but this is
[1:03:15] living but who gave that life who made
[1:03:18] that life where did that come from right
[1:03:22] right there's one source yes there's one
[1:03:24] source it it wasn't some big bang it
[1:03:27] wasn't something out there some Cosmic
[1:03:29] combustion that happened it wasn't some
[1:03:31] no amoeba that just kind of suddenly
[1:03:33] burst forth or something like that but
[1:03:34] life came from One Source One Source of
[1:03:37] Life John 1 says that was which from the
[1:03:38] beginning which we have heard we have
[1:03:40] seen with our eyes which we have looked
[1:03:42] upon and our hands have handled the word
[1:03:45] of life where did life come from it
[1:03:47] comes from the word of God that they
[1:03:49] came from the thoughts of God God is the
[1:03:52] Creator and the being of life he is life
[1:03:57] Amen in the beginning was the word he's
[1:03:59] the word in him was life amen and in
[1:04:03] Genesis we could say as Adam was formed
[1:04:05] in the image of God and the word life
[1:04:10] breathe life into the image like God
[1:04:14] himself
[1:04:16] breathed and Man became a living amen

[1:04:51] through you and I
[1:04:55] amen amen
[1:04:58] amen it was a creator that breathed life
[1:05:01] into the vessel there if you can think
[1:05:04] there back in Lazarus day at time and he
[1:05:07] was sitting in a tomb dead and gone and
[1:05:10] corrupted in in the Tomb and they rolled
[1:05:12] the stone back as Jesus stood there said
[1:05:15] roll a stone back on the grave and all
[1:05:17] were standing around and what was needed
[1:05:20] was there was a body that was corrupt it
[1:05:22] was void of Life there was no life no
[1:05:25] more it had gone from the body but there
[1:05:27] was one on the scene that had the
[1:05:29] ability the word himself was standing
[1:05:31] there and he had the ability to speak
[1:05:33] what he could speak life because the
[1:05:36] word in flesh was there on the scene and
[1:05:38] he cried out
[1:05:41] Lazarus you know what was happening at
[1:05:43] that moment Supernatural CPR was being
[1:05:46] was happening as the word breath was
[1:05:49] being pumped into that body in another
[1:05:51] realm and Drew him back to mortality
[1:05:55] oh that's what life comes from that's
[1:05:57] what life from that another realm can do
[1:05:59] when the word speaks come on that same
[1:06:02] word is present today you might be dead
[1:06:04] as sticks spiritually speaking but the
[1:06:07] same word is here today to speak life
[1:06:10] into your dead
[1:06:14] vessel I say Breath of God breathe this
[1:06:17] morning breathe this morning and you say
[1:06:20] oh God I need a Rejuvenation I need
[1:06:23] something to fill me I don't want man's
[1:06:25] life
[1:06:26] I don't want natural I want a
[1:06:28] supernatural infusion I need Super CPR
[1:06:31] this morning to breathe down my body and
[1:06:34] Infuse
[1:06:36] me and he said unto me prophesy under
[1:06:39] these bones and say to them oh ye Dry
[1:06:43] Bones hear the word what hear the life
[1:06:46] of the Lord thus say the Lord God unto
[1:06:49] these bones behold I will cause breath
[1:06:52] yes to enter into you
[1:06:56] and ye shall
[1:06:59] live oh they were Dry Bones they looked
[1:07:02] really scary and nobody likes a skeleton
[1:07:05] there was nothing there there was no
[1:07:06] life at all but he said something's
[1:07:08] going to change and so it went from
[1:07:10] drybones then it went to some senu oh
[1:07:13] someone was dead in sin wretched looking
[1:07:15] nobody likes a skull and skeleton oh
[1:07:18] dear goodness I don't want to see that
[1:07:19] but then his senu starts to come tendons
[1:07:22] and muscles start to form oh it looks
[1:07:24] pretty good now a little better little
[1:07:26] bit of Merit little bit of morals coming
[1:07:28] into the body hey that's not too bad
[1:07:31] flesh started to come subcutaneous
[1:07:33] tissue maybe some fatty tissue maybe he
[1:07:35] looks even christian-like
[1:07:38] oh hey I look pretty good you know I'm
[1:07:42] looking more like a
[1:07:45] body even dress right he's got a suit on
[1:07:48] he comes to church put some skin on that
[1:07:51] body maybe this little epidermis right
[1:07:54] here wow oh oh man he's even got a
[1:07:56] little religious spirit he says amen
[1:07:58] here and there and
[1:08:00] everywhere but until the life was
[1:08:03] breathed into that
[1:08:05] messel there was it was dead oh my God
[1:08:09] help me this morning may the Breath of
[1:08:11] God it isn't in your marriage it's not
[1:08:13] in your good morals it's not in what you
[1:08:15] look like or what your suit is or what
[1:08:17] your skin is or even how loud you say
[1:08:19] Amen but when the life of God breaths
[1:08:22] into you the word of life brings life
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:33] Hallelujah beautiful it
[1:08:35] requires the Breath of God and man
[1:08:40] became a living
[1:08:45] Soul God
[1:08:47] cares about life yeah very much he cares
[1:08:52] yeah because actually it's it's his life
[1:08:56] yes in
[1:08:58] you and he cares about his life yes
[1:09:04] amen because now to get ahead of myself
[1:09:08] but you're now a
[1:09:10] carrier wow yes sir
[1:09:16] amenti it's not just halfhazard to
[1:09:20] him all things were made by him and
[1:09:22] without him not was anything made that
[1:09:24] was made in him was life and the life
[1:09:27] was the light of man that's why God
[1:09:29] hates a
[1:09:30] murderer yeah because it's taking and
[1:09:34] destroying something that God considers
[1:09:36] so precious God himself breathed life
[1:09:39] into Adam and Man became a living soul
[1:09:42] and there ad was and a murderer comes
[1:09:44] and takes the life away it's it God
[1:09:46] takes that as such an affront to
[1:09:48] him can you imagine The Giver of Life
[1:09:52] someone taking what the giver gave wow
[1:09:56] then a prophet can come behind that and
[1:09:58] say that's kill someone's
[1:10:03] influence and you kill the impact of the
[1:10:07] life that is uttering forth from that
[1:10:09] being God gave that life God put in that
[1:10:12] character God molded that person to
[1:10:15] craft a certain influence that they
[1:10:17] could project a certain life in this
[1:10:20] hour and then someone would come behind
[1:10:22] that and try to kill the influence God
[1:10:25] is very very angry against
[1:10:29] that but BR says you people he said to
[1:10:32] sawblade tempers dear goodness that's
[1:10:34] always spouting off in the mouth he said
[1:10:36] you're guilty if you speak a word
[1:10:37] against your brother that's not right
[1:10:40] just go and tear it down you don't have
[1:10:42] to stick a knife in him man's back to
[1:10:44] kill him you break his character and you
[1:10:46] kill him kill his influence speak
[1:10:48] against your pastor say something bad
[1:10:50] about him you just might as well have
[1:10:52] shot
[1:10:53] him told something that wasn't WR about
[1:10:55] him well it kill his influence with the
[1:10:57] people the things like that you're
[1:10:59] guilty why because they're carriers of
[1:11:02] the life inside of them and you speak
[1:11:04] that word you say something it's killing
[1:11:06] the influence that they
[1:11:08] have God cares Bo if he care
[1:11:14] yeah that's why we don't defile the
[1:11:20] body God has a memory for body defilers
[1:11:24] and destroyers and corruptors
[1:11:26] know ye not that you are a temple yeah
[1:11:29] of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:11:32] you if any man defile the temple of God
[1:11:36] him shall God destroy for the temple of
[1:11:40] God is Holy which Temple ye
[1:11:45] are and we can recognize it's a holy
[1:11:48] Temple it's a holy vessel why because
[1:11:52] inside of you and I is a holy life
[1:11:54] that's been been deposited inside of us
[1:11:56] maybe we look at our vessel just a
[1:11:58] little bit different and someone else's
[1:12:00] vessel just a little different because
[1:12:02] they are temples temples of a living God
[1:12:05] living in flesh in this
[1:12:08] hour wow amen and God cares about them
[1:12:17] yeah so The Giver of Life cares greatly
[1:12:22] about the carrier of Life yeah
[1:12:26] he gave the ability to a
[1:12:28] woman to be a
[1:12:30] carrier I
[1:12:32] was you know when
[1:12:34] someone has been
[1:12:36] entrusted to carry something that
[1:12:38] precious to
[1:12:41] God they are given as brother Brown
[1:12:44] calls to a woman a sacred trust yeah
[1:12:49] there's a trust given right to the
[1:12:52] carrier cuz God is the author of life
[1:12:56] and he hands it to you he says all right
[1:12:59] I've trusted you with this life what are
[1:13:02] you going to do with it
[1:13:05] yeah I'm going to speak I'm speaking
[1:13:08] spiritually but Brown goes through
[1:13:12] different quotes I'll just read a couple
[1:13:13] of them he says her body speaking of a
[1:13:15] woman's given to her as a sacred Trust
[1:13:18] From God she's the only one she reasons
[1:13:22] she's so sacred she is to bring forth
[1:13:25] life into the Earth her body is a beding
[1:13:28] grounds of life therefore that's the
[1:13:31] reason she's given this sacred trust and
[1:13:35] I want you just to put your spiritual
[1:13:37] Minds on as butter Brandon was is
[1:13:39] laboring through the invisible Union of
[1:13:41] the Bride in that message and he's going
[1:13:43] through and he's speaking very naturally
[1:13:45] but you got to realize it's because
[1:13:46] there's a very significant spiritual
[1:13:48] type that we need to watch and follow
[1:13:51] it's because that sacred trust is
[1:13:52] because of life and we're carriers of
[1:13:55] this unspeakable
[1:13:58] gift an unspeakable gift as it's quoted
[1:14:01] in the scriptures but unfortunately what
[1:14:03] happens is in this day and
[1:14:06] age brother Bram goes through the sacred
[1:14:08] Trust of Womanhood and the sacred Trust
[1:14:10] of of of virtue and the sacred Trust of
[1:14:14] motherhood and such that they have and
[1:14:15] he says she must not defile that she has
[1:14:18] a sacred trust it's her character how
[1:14:20] she handles herself and how she she
[1:14:22] holds herself before other men in her
[1:14:24] pure and such these are all critical and
[1:14:27] you can look at the natural but it's a
[1:14:29] spiritual type because God is warning
[1:14:31] and urging and watching his bride in
[1:14:33] this last day you must keep yourself
[1:14:35] pure you must keep yourself urgent you
[1:14:38] must keep yourself at hold your your
[1:14:40] body and your mind before all men
[1:14:42] spiritually
[1:14:45] speaking and he goes through and he can
[1:14:47] he the prophet Cuts pretty strong he
[1:14:50] says now keep the church in mind he said
[1:14:51] she's kissing and slopping and mixing
[1:14:53] around everything else but the word let
[1:14:55] the devil and education and scientific
[1:14:56] searches and so forth he said that's
[1:14:58] what breaks up homes talking about
[1:15:00] motherhood and breaking of motherhood
[1:15:02] but he's trying to put a thought through
[1:15:03] he's trying to put a put put put the the
[1:15:06] type through to you and I you must watch
[1:15:08] you are carrying
[1:15:10] life oh but in this age in this hour
[1:15:13] it's a little bit different because it's
[1:15:15] my body it's my
[1:15:18] right come on I do what I want don't
[1:15:23] tell me what I do with my body wow
[1:15:26] is that around is that around the world
[1:15:28] yeah oh yeah but you got to watch
[1:15:30] because it's oh that's just you get
[1:15:32] caught in some natural thing but watch
[1:15:34] the spiritual watch the spiritual
[1:15:37] natural type spiritual so if then an age
[1:15:40] that we see and all through the world
[1:15:42] it's my body my choice my this my that
[1:15:44] you don't have a choice as God's body
[1:15:47] his choice your choice is his choice
[1:15:49] your his your thoughts are his thoughts
[1:15:51] it's not what you think it's not your
[1:15:52] body I'm a temple of life from the
[1:15:55] Creator it's what he desired what I
[1:15:58] surrendered to to his
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:04] will naturally speaking I can live this
[1:16:07] way I can live like a prostitute I can
[1:16:09] do what I want I can HIIT I can inhibit
[1:16:13] life
[1:16:15] Wow and that's exactly what's happening
[1:16:20] spiritually my thoughts my way my
[1:16:23] interpretation
[1:16:25] what my friend says what this person
[1:16:29] says what my family member does I'm
[1:16:31] going to do it the way I want to I'm
[1:16:33] going to believe the way I think it
[1:16:35] should be I'm going to interpret the
[1:16:36] word and the message the way I don't see
[1:16:38] the quote quite that way watch it it
[1:16:40] isn't your body it's his he created you
[1:16:44] he formed you he placed his life inside
[1:16:47] of
[1:16:49] you oh it's so subtle that Demon's so
[1:16:53] subtle you can get caught up in it yeah
[1:16:55] but I say watch it yeah
[1:16:58] amen that's what the denominational
[1:17:00] Spirit started to do in the church it
[1:17:04] rejected
[1:17:08] life in
[1:17:10] 1956
[1:17:12] rejected the word of life that was
[1:17:14] trying to be deposited into the
[1:17:17] womb and they aborted The Life of
[1:17:22] Christ and accepted dead seed from man's
[1:17:26] ideas and are no more the carrier of
[1:17:34] life but there is a
[1:17:40] bride amen there is a bride that's been
[1:17:44] entrusted yeah entrusted yeah with life
[1:17:49] yeah amen
[1:17:58] she's a type brother Brenham
[1:18:00] says she has the same precious virtues
[1:18:02] by Spirit given to her to preserve the
[1:18:07] spirit and the word never committing
[1:18:09] adultery with anything of the world or
[1:18:11] anything she stays virgin to the word as
[1:18:14] a woman is to stay virtuous to her
[1:18:16] husband it's a sacred trust to honor her
[1:18:19] Lord's word above every man's Creed so
[1:18:23] young ladies and sisters and such when
[1:18:25] you hear the message and I know it can
[1:18:26] be pretty cutting and strong but you are
[1:18:29] a you are a type God is needing in this
[1:18:31] hour someone that can naturally type the
[1:18:33] spiritual where there are those that are
[1:18:35] virtuous and they stand with their
[1:18:37] character pure and they stand as a
[1:18:39] mother fulfilling all the attributes of
[1:18:41] a mama that is so gone in this day and
[1:18:43] hour some mama that's at home and taking
[1:18:45] care of the bacon and taking care of all
[1:18:47] the the the the household and her
[1:18:49] children and instead of worrying about
[1:18:50] some Instagram feed she's teaching her
[1:18:52] boys to be gentlemen and her girls to be
[1:18:54] ladies that's a Mama you are standing in
[1:18:56] this hour cuz life is deposited in you
[1:18:59] and you are actually there as a carrier
[1:19:01] and showing to the world that this word
[1:19:03] will stand
[1:19:05] pure if you could take that solmn
[1:19:08] responsibility upon you because you are
[1:19:10] a representation of the Church of God
[1:19:12] the bride of Christ you are a mirror of
[1:19:15] the Bride spiritually oh may you take
[1:19:18] that so so trusted so
[1:19:22] sacred amen and this world wants to
[1:19:25] defile and to wash it
[1:19:28] through stand may that be an assault to
[1:19:32] your
[1:19:32] spiritual well-being
[1:19:40] yeah why is it so strong why is butter
[1:19:42] brandom so
[1:19:44] strong all through the
[1:19:49] message
[1:19:51] because there's a
[1:19:53] union that God will not Unite with a
[1:19:57] deviled bride yeah
[1:20:01] yeah the only life she can carry she
[1:20:05] must be
[1:20:06] pure and the original word seed
[1:20:09] deposited in her womb cannot be a
[1:20:12] corrupted womb defiled womb and so God
[1:20:15] so cares yeah about the carrier yeah so
[1:20:20] cares
[1:20:22] amen the church if we go through the
[1:20:26] church through the history and Through
[1:20:28] the Ages through the New Testament
[1:20:30] Church was also a carrier and I just
[1:20:34] find how the word is so you know when
[1:20:36] you just listen to the message and you
[1:20:38] see how a prophet just starts to
[1:20:39] dovetail all the types and shadows
[1:20:42] through the scripture starts to mirror
[1:20:43] it through time and he pulls back into
[1:20:45] scripture places it in time puts us into
[1:20:47] this age to me it's just incredible I
[1:20:50] just I just Marvel Marvel at it how it
[1:20:52] just just perfectly interweaves and how
[1:20:54] brother brandham takes and goes back to
[1:20:56] Abraham and he starts to type Hagar and
[1:20:59] Abraham to Luther and the stock and he
[1:21:01] starts to weave this together to show us
[1:21:03] how this life has moved through history
[1:21:07] amen he says there Hagar was a carrier
[1:21:09] of seed but a Bond woman all right she
[1:21:12] was she was a Bond woman but through
[1:21:14] doubt because Sarah doubted that it
[1:21:16] could happen and she was given to
[1:21:18] Abraham Abraham this is where your seed
[1:21:20] is going to come from this is where your
[1:21:22] son is going to come from and so Hagar
[1:21:24] has the bond woman is there to given to
[1:21:26] Abraham and produced a wild man brother
[1:21:29] BR says now Hagar one little slight
[1:21:31] difference through woman not through
[1:21:33] Abraham now Abraham didn't want to do it
[1:21:35] but God let him do it because he said he
[1:21:38] let balum go on now notice by slightly
[1:21:40] different she brought forth Ishmael
[1:21:43] which was a wild man never conquered he
[1:21:45] lives by his bow he was a wild man he is
[1:21:48] yet today that's your Prophet see does
[1:21:50] not air with a Shu notice he said she is
[1:21:53] a carrier Hagar come forth as a stalk
[1:21:57] and then come pollen and then come the
[1:21:59] Shu and then come the sea he goes now
[1:22:01] watch these carriers he goes I want you
[1:22:03] to watch there how much does God care
[1:22:06] about the life the Seed of Abraham is
[1:22:08] deposited into the womb of Hagar but
[1:22:10] Hagar was the was a Bond woman and if
[1:22:12] you want to look how much God cares
[1:22:14] about life here Hagar is then pushed out
[1:22:17] and she goes with she sent out a camp
[1:22:19] sent away with Ishmael and there they're
[1:22:21] dying yeah Ishmael is now dying
[1:22:25] and Hagar leaves and and doesn't want to
[1:22:27] see her son dies he's crying there and
[1:22:29] and and and dying of thirst and
[1:22:31] dehydration but it said and God heard
[1:22:34] the voice of the
[1:22:36] lad God did not hear the voice of
[1:22:40] Hagar but he heard the voice of the lad
[1:22:42] why because in him was the Seed of
[1:22:45] Abraham actually God cared about the
[1:22:48] seed he cared about the life so the life
[1:22:51] of Abraham is was actually in there but
[1:22:53] corrupted with Hagar but God
[1:22:55] cared so he heard the voice of the lad
[1:22:58] and sent a rescue out to them why
[1:23:01] because it was of Abraham seed yes amen
[1:23:06] he had one thing he had car for one
[1:23:07] thing yeah his seed yeah in ishmail
[1:23:15] yeah L BR says but the Bible said
[1:23:18] Lord heard the child why he Seed of
[1:23:21] Abraham he hears the Cry of the children
[1:23:23] of Abraham and if if you're in Christ
[1:23:25] tonight you are Abraham's seed if he
[1:23:28] heard ishmael's cry come on if he heard
[1:23:31] ishmael's cry who is seed of the Bond
[1:23:34] woman what about the Seed of Abraham
[1:23:37] what about you here tonight who the
[1:23:38] spiritual Seed of Abraham through faith
[1:23:40] believing What If he if he heard itnails
[1:23:43] cry can he not hear your cry can I not
[1:23:45] hear your need I'm there I'm needing
[1:23:47] water from a rock tonight I'm needing
[1:23:49] the Mana from heaven I'm needing
[1:23:50] something but your Seed of Abraham just
[1:23:53] lift up and cry out to
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:23:57] him he said she Hagar was very religious
[1:24:01] but he never heard her the Covenant
[1:24:03] wasn't with that it was with Abraham's
[1:24:06] seed that's and he said he swore by
[1:24:09] himself and made the Covenant
[1:24:11] unconditionally between Abraham and his
[1:24:13] seed forever he said you are Abraham's
[1:24:16] seed if you're Christ and the same
[1:24:20] promise he made to Abraham is yours amen
[1:24:25] if God can hear
[1:24:27] ishmail God can hear you and
[1:24:30] me if God can hear ishmail
[1:24:34] yeah think about it
[1:24:39] yeah now hegar the carrier the stock
[1:24:42] doesn't look like the seed right yes but
[1:24:46] life was still in there yes he said but
[1:24:49] the life that was in the seed is in the
[1:24:51] stock that was Luther that little talk
[1:24:54] had many blades and it went off from
[1:24:56] Luther into ziggly and down in Calvin
[1:24:58] and others it didn't look like the
[1:25:00] original but there was still life inside
[1:25:03] and I was with brother Aiden I don't
[1:25:05] know where you are this morning but
[1:25:06] Aiden I was in the greenhouse there on
[1:25:07] Friday it was and he was talking about
[1:25:09] the cuting and I was thinking knowing
[1:25:11] this was the direction that the Lord was
[1:25:13] maybe leading and he he had a whole
[1:25:14] thing of cuting in there and I'm like
[1:25:16] well you know help me understand this
[1:25:18] cuz I'm not a greenhouse guy there's no
[1:25:19] green thumbs here all right not even my
[1:25:21] long shot and so he had this whole box
[1:25:24] of cuting there then he then he showed
[1:25:26] me in this little tray there's they're
[1:25:27] all Little Seeds growing and little
[1:25:29] stems are already going just from The
[1:25:30] Cutting they took a cutting off not a
[1:25:33] seed not a root not a nothing they took
[1:25:35] a cutting and they put it in the dirt
[1:25:37] because there was life in the stock
[1:25:40] there was life there and he just put in
[1:25:42] the dirt it was didn't come from nothing
[1:25:44] I thought that's incredible what is
[1:25:45] doing that the life is doing that it's
[1:25:48] still there rising to the stalk it
[1:25:50] didn't look like the seed but there's
[1:25:51] still life in
[1:25:52] there amen
[1:25:54] am there it was in in in Luther's time
[1:25:57] it maybe didn't look like the seed but
[1:25:59] there was still life there it was still
[1:26:01] carrying through that St and there when
[1:26:04] I can I just put my mind back and I try
[1:26:06] to put myself in little Luther's time
[1:26:08] there and they started to receive the
[1:26:10] word of that day and he started to
[1:26:12] receive the just shall live by
[1:26:15] faith yeah you can you imagine when that
[1:26:19] was revealed yeah Luther starts to
[1:26:22] realize wait a second it's not and the
[1:26:24] merits and and all of this that I got to
[1:26:26] do and indulgences that I pay for this
[1:26:28] pray to marry that and blow this candle
[1:26:30] here and light it there put that he
[1:26:31] started to realize it's by faith that
[1:26:33] just shall live by faith by believing
[1:26:35] we're saved by faith and he started to
[1:26:37] do and then the Bible started to come
[1:26:39] and can you imagine the first time that
[1:26:41] the commoner like you and me got to read
[1:26:44] the word oh my goodness I just imagine
[1:26:48] reading there in Psalms as they go to
[1:26:50] Psalms and finally said oh give ear to
[1:26:53] my word words oh Lord first
[1:26:57] time consider my meditation oh God
[1:27:01] hearken hearken under the voice of My
[1:27:03] Cry can you imagine oh I walk through
[1:27:06] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:27:08] fear no evil they could read it for the
[1:27:10] first time oh you just read it every day
[1:27:13] of the week and and well that's a
[1:27:15] wonderful scripture No the first time
[1:27:17] yeah wow I've never read that before
[1:27:20] it's been held back by the Catholic
[1:27:22] priest he said I can't get it but no
[1:27:23] that shall live by faith and by this
[1:27:26] word you need it you need to read it you
[1:27:28] need to read
[1:27:30] it oh my goodness hallu you mean it's
[1:27:34] not in deeds and doctrines no no you
[1:27:36] it's not in sacraments and merits no
[1:27:38] it's not in that but it's by faith in
[1:27:39] Christ oh can I read more yes here it
[1:27:43] is oh thank you Lord beloved believe not
[1:27:46] every Spirit but tried every Spirit
[1:27:48] whether they be of God and so then they
[1:27:49] could go and be like wait a second this
[1:27:51] doesn't match the word you're Antichrist
[1:27:56] because they now had it they could start
[1:27:58] to feed yes the life starting to Surge
[1:28:03] through the
[1:28:05] St they still believed in
[1:28:09] Trinity but it was starting to move yeah
[1:28:12] didn't look like the seed but it's
[1:28:14] starting to move
[1:28:15] amen all
[1:28:19] right
[1:28:21] imagine the word Justified
[1:28:24] think about it the just shall live by
[1:28:28] faith imagine that moment when Luther
[1:28:32] when the word Justified struck Luther I
[1:28:36] think sometimes the word Justified needs
[1:28:38] to strike us again and again because we
[1:28:41] can go through life sometimes we go
[1:28:42] through some difficult days difficult
[1:28:44] trials and circumstances but you were
[1:28:47] Justified I mean we got to come back to
[1:28:49] the original word here and just say wait
[1:28:50] a second what does that mean can I just
[1:28:52] go back well you know what it means but
[1:28:54] sometimes we need to soak it in and
[1:28:56] drink in the water because butter Bram
[1:28:58] says Justified though you never done it
[1:29:01] at all we know this but living it God
[1:29:04] don't see your mistake as I said to the
[1:29:06] young people last night he don't care
[1:29:07] too sense about your mistake he sees you
[1:29:09] through the blood when you when you put
[1:29:12] it under the blood he sees you Justified
[1:29:15] I imagine their old Luther did a couple
[1:29:17] little he clicks when he saw it I'm
[1:29:19] Justified I didn't do it in the first
[1:29:21] place his blood covers me and he started
[1:29:24] to preach that out preach that out
[1:29:25] preach that out say you've been
[1:29:27] Justified you never did it all your
[1:29:29] wrongs are all done done they're all
[1:29:31] gone God don't even see it no
[1:29:33] more oh you know what happened life
[1:29:36] started to
[1:29:39] Surge praise God
[1:29:44] Amen it might have looked a little wild
[1:29:47] but it was carrying
[1:29:49] something life
[1:29:54] butam says notice the seed goes in the
[1:29:57] ground it's the Original Seed but when
[1:29:59] it comes forth it brings forth a life
[1:30:02] but what does life do out of a seed of
[1:30:03] wheat it doesn't produce the same stock
[1:30:05] of wheat right then or the same grain of
[1:30:07] wheat right then it's the life of the
[1:30:10] wheat but it's in a carrier stage yeah
[1:30:14] and that was the first Reformation you
[1:30:15] said when Luther came out of Darkness
[1:30:17] out of Thea of chaos it had to die he
[1:30:20] said but after Pentecost he said it had
[1:30:22] to die are they saved
[1:30:26] yeah under that anointing that was the
[1:30:29] word of their hour but what gets what
[1:30:32] happens is when they don't follow the
[1:30:35] life as it moves that's right there's
[1:30:38] the key God's life continues it grows it
[1:30:43] was growing and those that got stuck and
[1:30:45] said oh this is good
[1:30:47] enough I'm good right here there's the
[1:30:50] problem as God's life started to move
[1:30:53] through the stock and now it continues
[1:30:55] to go and here we know it came into into
[1:30:58] the westly era whatam types that back to
[1:31:00] Sarah he said now or we need more
[1:31:03] Holiness and we're Sanctified now
[1:31:05] through the blood and the cleansing
[1:31:06] power of it the scripture says follow
[1:31:08] peace with all men and Holiness without
[1:31:09] which no man shall see the Lord and in
[1:31:12] Hebrews 13 wherefore Jesus said that he
[1:31:13] might sanctify the people with his own
[1:31:16] blood and so this era was now moving
[1:31:18] into a different age a different a
[1:31:20] different tassel age and life was now
[1:31:21] moving forward as it gets closer and
[1:31:24] closer to the original and Sarah brother
[1:31:26] Brown says is a free woman through
[1:31:28] promise produced a kind gentle Isaac
[1:31:33] looked a little closer a little more
[1:31:35] closer to the na in the natural promised
[1:31:37] seed but it wasn't the Royal seed all
[1:31:41] right but ABR say now notice it changes
[1:31:43] its position watch nature forming to the
[1:31:45] word of God as the sun death burial and
[1:31:48] Resurrection then come the pollen that
[1:31:51] was Wesley and like the seed that what
[1:31:53] that life did on the wheat or the corn
[1:31:56] looked a lot more like it because Wesley
[1:31:58] the second word second word word of God
[1:32:01] bring in his church up come through
[1:32:03] sanctification a holy people a nation
[1:32:05] now separating and cleansing themselves
[1:32:08] and under Holiness he said in the order
[1:32:10] of Holiness and then when he gets
[1:32:11] Sanctified that cleanses that desire out
[1:32:13] of him you say well I'm Justified I
[1:32:15] didn't do it in the per first place but
[1:32:16] brother R said he needs to continue
[1:32:18] onward he may be an immoral man or woman
[1:32:21] and he's a drunkard and he smells that
[1:32:22] drink he says it's still there but when
[1:32:24] he's Sanctified it cleanses the desire
[1:32:27] out of him amen it takes the want away
[1:32:31] he can be tempted but he takes he takes
[1:32:33] the want away and he said but he said
[1:32:35] he's still not right it needed to move
[1:32:38] further cuz it wasn't still looking
[1:32:40] quite like the original quite
[1:32:44] yet it was gentle it was a promised
[1:32:48] Nation but rejected the seed and
[1:32:51] crucified him yeah that's what that
[1:32:53] Nation did it wasn't
[1:32:57] perfect Sarah laughed up her sleeve said
[1:33:00] how could this be Abraham and I haven't
[1:33:02] been as young people for 20 years and
[1:33:05] nearly 100 years old me have pleasure
[1:33:07] with my Lord oh my she goes to my my my
[1:33:10] milk veins are gone how could I God said
[1:33:13] I've promised it yeah it's coming anyhow
[1:33:19] yeah he said so did
[1:33:22] Wesley that age
[1:33:24] as they came up as the life surged and
[1:33:26] through the carrier that life kept
[1:33:29] moving and as Wesley said how can we
[1:33:31] accept speaking in tongues and Divine
[1:33:33] Healing and stuff it's not for us in
[1:33:35] this
[1:33:37] day types it back to Sarah says how
[1:33:40] could I have a son of this age wow God
[1:33:43] said it's going to happen anyway that's
[1:33:45] right yes
[1:33:47] amen hold on to that we'll keep going
[1:33:51] God said I promised in the last days
[1:33:53] I'll pour on my spirit upon All Flesh he
[1:33:55] promised to do it he went on and done it
[1:33:57] anyhow amen God went on and done it
[1:34:00] anyhow he don't care well well I don't
[1:34:02] know is that not impossible God's going
[1:34:04] to move his life through
[1:34:05] regardless his plan's going to take
[1:34:07] place regardless amen and so there then
[1:34:11] now Pentecost now comes and there that
[1:34:14] that promised seed was no Isaac but
[1:34:16] there had to be another it wasn't a
[1:34:18] natural seed but there was another seed
[1:34:19] to come life now moving on continuing
[1:34:22] more and more to look like the full
[1:34:24] wheat but now it's pushing its way
[1:34:26] through to a restoration of the gift and
[1:34:29] looking so
[1:34:31] close
[1:34:37] yeah
[1:34:39] Mary but Abraham says it types it out of
[1:34:43] the
[1:34:44] Shu she accepted the word by faith like
[1:34:47] Abraham her father and that made way for
[1:34:51] the seed to be deposited in her womb
[1:34:54] but he but this was the shook as it
[1:34:56] first pushed forth and birth it was
[1:34:59] still a
[1:35:03] carrier still a carrier I know we can
[1:35:06] look at it and we do have the faith like
[1:35:08] Mary when the word came by her way and
[1:35:10] she said Lord be it unto me and she was
[1:35:12] like Abraham the faith of Abraham
[1:35:14] something was happening and Faith was
[1:35:16] deposited so she could receive word seed
[1:35:19] into her womb but she was still a
[1:35:22] carrier
[1:35:25] still a carrier Mary by no relationship
[1:35:27] but through promise just like Abraham
[1:35:29] got the promise of God the word of God
[1:35:31] but believe the promise Behold a
[1:35:33] handmade unto the Lord God had formed
[1:35:35] All Through the Ages to think that all
[1:35:38] through the Old Testament working and
[1:35:40] molding and shaping to come to a time as
[1:35:43] prophecy was sent out there 8700 and
[1:35:46] something years earlier there Isaiah
[1:35:48] said a virgin shall conceive and all the
[1:35:50] Prophecies of God Through Time molded to
[1:35:52] it came to just one little lady who
[1:35:55] could reach with faith and that prophecy
[1:35:58] reach our womb and out comes the word
[1:36:04] amen Mary was not the
[1:36:08] seed she was only the shu to the seed is
[1:36:13] your
[1:36:14] Prophet the two others was carriers of
[1:36:17] Life only the natural seed Mary was not
[1:36:18] the seed itself but like faith in God's
[1:36:21] word brought a more real image right yes
[1:36:25] the Pentecost movement came as the G
[1:36:27] gifts were brought forth and the
[1:36:28] restoration of the gifts it brought more
[1:36:30] image of what that was supposed to look
[1:36:33] like it wasn't it it was a carrier still
[1:36:36] of what was to come and people got stuck
[1:36:39] somewhere there at that point it looked
[1:36:41] so good it looked so Wonder this must be
[1:36:43] it it wasn't it was still coming
[1:36:49] forth but like the shuck of weed a corn
[1:36:52] of wheed it hold holds the weed inside
[1:36:55] and protects it until it's able to be
[1:36:57] matured on its own then the seed itself
[1:37:00] that then it was the seed itself that
[1:37:02] left her just like the seed was in her
[1:37:04] womb she wasn't the seed she didn't
[1:37:06] produce her body didn't produce the seed
[1:37:08] God is the seed yeah that's right so her
[1:37:12] War womb nurtured it God's children have
[1:37:15] that same Spirit of Mary because it's
[1:37:17] still that life moving forth but again
[1:37:19] it's when they started to draw the
[1:37:21] boundary lines and say this is great
[1:37:23] this is is it this is all we need no
[1:37:26] don't stop there don't stop there the
[1:37:28] word's still moving it still has to
[1:37:30] accomplish what it came for that's right
[1:37:34] amen and out of Mary came The Original
[1:37:39] Seed yeah the full full potency of the
[1:37:44] word cuz then the word was now made
[1:37:47] flesh amen and walked amongst men yeah
[1:37:51] yeah amen
[1:37:54] it wasn't a
[1:37:55] carrier the word in flesh yeah yeah was
[1:37:59] the original yeah it wasn't a carrier
[1:38:02] yeah life had now come through all time
[1:38:05] through through agar into Sarah into
[1:38:07] Mary the word and now it had birthed by
[1:38:10] the spoken word the original life
[1:38:15] am think of it here had come the Royal
[1:38:18] seed now the mighty conqueror everything
[1:38:22] that had been spoken in prophet I now
[1:38:24] was there on Earth not part of God not a
[1:38:26] little half and half not 99% all of God
[1:38:30] was now deposited into flesh and stood
[1:38:32] there conquering ready to take on what
[1:38:35] the word had had prophesied for him to
[1:38:37] do amen God stepped on Earth not just to
[1:38:40] be well hello no he came with with
[1:38:43] business that's right he's not here amen
[1:38:45] that's right I got a whole lot of
[1:38:47] Prophecy to fulfill yeah there's word
[1:38:50] that's been spoken that I have now come
[1:38:52] after thund hundreds of years I've now
[1:38:55] come down to flesh to fulfill my
[1:38:58] word God was coming to me in business
[1:39:00] with man amen Pentecost was as Mary
[1:39:04] Pentecostal Feast look what Mary did now
[1:39:07] watch
[1:39:08] this look what Mary did wrong what did
[1:39:11] Mary do wrong he says at a Pentecostal
[1:39:14] Feast one time she was faced with a
[1:39:15] bunch of dignitaries and priest and when
[1:39:17] her son she couldn't find him anywhere
[1:39:19] she went back three days Journeys she
[1:39:21] had left him that's right problem one
[1:39:23] she had left him she should never have
[1:39:25] left him never leave life never leave
[1:39:28] the word how on Earth did she let the
[1:39:30] Living Word of God she knew who he was
[1:39:32] and she left him behind oh I know where
[1:39:34] he at I would have stayed right beside
[1:39:36] him because she knew something was going
[1:39:38] to come about who knows that what time
[1:39:40] but I'm going to stick close to the
[1:39:42] word and she left him never leave the
[1:39:45] word Saints like a modern church today
[1:39:47] about 3 to 5 he said 25 has Church left
[1:39:50] about 50 years ago or 75 left him at the
[1:39:52] Pentecost Feast Mary went back up with
[1:39:55] Joseph 3 days looking for him she found
[1:39:57] him where did she find him in the temple
[1:40:01] discussing the word of God yeah and
[1:40:03] right in the front of those priests
[1:40:05] those dignified Mary let the curtain
[1:40:07] drop he said and she did exactly the
[1:40:10] thing she should not have done called
[1:40:13] her the mother of God that's right he
[1:40:17] said she said your father and I have
[1:40:19] sought you with
[1:40:20] tears for day and night your father and
[1:40:22] I better around is claiming that the
[1:40:24] birth wasn't Supernatural wow that one
[1:40:27] little moment wow denying that the birth
[1:40:30] was of natural ABS ordinances it was a
[1:40:33] supernatural birth and your father and I
[1:40:36] wow maybe she was there in the PRI
[1:40:38] didn't maybe didn't want to stand the
[1:40:41] shame or the scorn or maybe well your
[1:40:43] father and I it sounded simple but
[1:40:44] brother brand goes right back to that
[1:40:46] one little verse in scripture and said
[1:40:48] she denied the supernatural birth
[1:40:56] God has a very keen eye yeah for his
[1:40:59] life all the way through yes not one
[1:41:02] moment would he want that to be
[1:41:04] contradicted or something bent or some
[1:41:06] idea injected wow
[1:41:09] yeah but Mary
[1:41:11] birthed produced a seed of Pentecost
[1:41:15] birthed what so now we bring you up to
[1:41:20] now yeah our day come on where are we
[1:41:24] come on where are we in this picture

[1:41:32] amen Pentecost age birthed a son of man
[1:41:35] ministry again to reveal and produce
[1:41:38] right what the Original Seed God didn't
[1:41:43] go through all of this just to stop
[1:41:45] somewhere in the middle and be like well
[1:41:47] the Stock's just good enough or the
[1:41:48] tassel's just good enough he had a
[1:41:50] desire because he said there's got to be
[1:41:53] be one like me I am the Masterpiece I
[1:41:56] need to have one that's just like

[1:42:05] word of this hour that can bring you and
[1:42:08] I to
[1:42:17] Perfection All Through

[1:42:26] says laying it out it's got to lay in
[1:42:28] the presence of the sun to ripen in the
[1:42:31] Glorious grain into the Glorious grain
[1:42:33] forming the perfect body of Christ amen
[1:42:38] yet except for a few he said in
[1:42:40] continuing the quote not but carriers

[1:42:44] into Canaan land there were those that
[1:42:46] were carriers of the word carries

[1:45:43] one to make the other justification to
[1:45:45] sanctification make way the baptism of
[1:45:47] the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy

[1:47:06] forward we're
[1:47:10] here look at
[1:47:11] nature we're
[1:47:14] here there's nothing once the the seed
[1:47:16] is produced and ejected by the Shu what
[1:47:19] next yeah we're here right
[1:47:25] this is the Golden
[1:47:31] Arrow Lord for the
[1:47:37] bride R says notice now when the grain
[1:47:40] life begins to lead the husk and goes to
[1:47:42] make the grain the husk opens up and
[1:47:46] excommunicates the grain he says that's
[1:47:48] right nature exactly what she said in
[1:47:51] Revelations 3 we find Le an age put him
[1:47:54] out now see it didn't back in the other
[1:47:56] ages because there was something else to
[1:47:58] be made it just passed through and
[1:48:00] passed through I've told you all along
[1:48:02] there's no more denominations coming
[1:48:04] we're at the End Amen that's where we're
[1:48:08] at we're at the end in the days of the
[1:48:12] voice of the seventh agel amen that's
[1:48:14] when all now these scriptures begin to
[1:48:16] come to manifestation because just like
[1:48:19] Christ when he came down in Earth and
[1:48:21] came and dwelt in flesh he had
[1:48:23] prophecies to fulfill yeah amen and if
[1:48:27] we are part of him in his same life we
[1:48:30] also have prophecies to fulfill that's
[1:48:33] right
[1:48:39] amen that same life has come back into a
[1:48:43] bright church that's who you are that's
[1:48:45] who this message came to call out not to
[1:48:48] produce a carrier but a living revealed
[1:48:51] life in flesh again but Braham says
[1:48:53] we'll bring forth the entire word of God
[1:48:57] in its fullness and in its
[1:49:00] strength amen hallelujah amen you say
[1:49:03] brother Michael I have there's no way I
[1:49:06] how can I don't worry about it it's not
[1:49:09] your life it's his life don't you worry
[1:49:12] about producing nothing the life
[1:49:14] produces itself you don't have to
[1:49:16] conjure something up you don't have to
[1:49:17] figure it out how on Earth am I going to
[1:49:19] be the bride you just are it will just
[1:49:22] come out of you because the life that's
[1:49:25] been deposited is his life I tell you
[1:49:28] the wheat doesn't worry about producing
[1:49:30] a seed it just
[1:49:32] comes it's simple and you've heard it a
[1:49:34] thousand times but maybe one day it just
[1:49:37] puts itself inside of onebody somebody's
[1:49:39] heart and maybe you're the last
[1:49:42] one thank you
[1:49:46] Lord Jesus didn't carry a
[1:49:49] portion like Wesley or Luther other ages
[1:49:51] gone by yeah like a pregnant mother she
[1:49:55] looks more and more something's coming
[1:49:57] there's signs showing that something's
[1:50:00] going to appear That's the
[1:50:03] carrier but now when it's
[1:50:07] birthed it possesses a life and the same
[1:50:11] life of the son of man is the same life
[1:50:15] that's in you and in me
[1:50:20] now the word
[1:50:23] spoke back to Mary says hey where have
[1:50:27] you been your father and I have worrying
[1:50:29] about you oh now the word go shot back
[1:50:32] and corrected the error and said wait I
[1:50:36] must be about my father's business yeah
[1:50:40] yeah but Brown says there is the secret
[1:50:44] of the message now the father's
[1:50:48] business he said what is the father's
[1:50:50] business could you think of the of what

[1:51:13] things that would take place like Moses
[1:51:14] said the Lord your God shall raise up a
[1:51:16] prophet among you like and unto me it
[1:51:18] was the father's business to fulfill the
[1:51:22] word word he stepped onto Earth to

[1:52:48] came to prove to show what is right the
[1:52:52] scriptures that were spoken of him so

[1:52:56] are Original Seed Life what are we here
[1:52:59] to do you are here to prove and

[1:55:17] and Omega first and last he said the
[1:55:18] first Ministry and the last ministry

[1:55:35] the son of man come to do vindicate
[1:55:37] Malachi 4 but amen but it says behold I

[1:55:43] had his part to play to vindicate that
[1:55:45] scripture but there's a you in there you
[1:55:48] and I have a part to play to vindicate
[1:55:51] that if there was just Elijah and not
[1:55:53] the seed on Earth to receive it it
[1:55:55] wouldn't be fully Vindicated but because
[1:55:57] you are here and you are here you are
[1:55:59] vindicating Malachi 4 to be right and
[1:56:03] [Applause]

[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:59:01] here he said the
[1:59:04] world now the world has to be in a
[1:59:07] certain position to make the seed break
[1:59:10] forth from the dirt going back in Prior
[1:59:15] ages as it went into the dirt to die and
[1:59:17] it had to do that for that seed to start
[1:59:19] to come forth it had to come that way he
[1:59:21] said to get it up or out of the Dark
[1:59:25] Ages there's a certain position that
[1:59:29] makes that seed Break Forth of the world
[1:59:31] and he's talking about the whole world
[1:59:33] nature he said some people oh the silent
[1:59:37] God you know all the dark dark CES and
[1:59:39] then poor martys and brother Bram talks
[1:59:40] about that man that you know said God
[1:59:43] you know was was silent there when all
[1:59:44] the Christians were died he said don't
[1:59:45] you know the seed has to lay in the dirt
[1:59:47] to die to rot before it can bring life
[1:59:49] or bring forth again the age had to be
[1:59:52] that way then for that to do that so
[1:59:56] does the age have to be this way the way
[1:59:58] it is certain economics certain
[2:00:01] positions certain world orders all have
[2:00:03] to be in a perfect state to produce the
[2:00:07] life it has to be this way don't look at
[2:00:09] the world this is so terrible I got that
[2:00:11] no it's okay it's okay it has to be that
[2:00:13] way the the Church of day go days gone
[2:00:16] by the dark AG say oh God where are you
[2:00:18] what's happening everybody's dying the
[2:00:20] martyrs are going into the car the this
[2:00:22] had to be that way so the so the seed
[2:00:24] could go into the dirt so it could rise
[2:00:25] forth so the stock could start to grow
[2:00:27] it had to be that way God said just wait
[2:00:29] a little bit it's okay I have a perfect
[2:00:31] plan I'm forming my image my life has to
[2:00:34] come through just carry it on just carry
[2:00:36] it on and I'll form the conditions to
[2:00:39] bring it to the very end right
[2:00:43] amen say look at Sodom we're living in
[2:00:45] the midst of it it looks like we're in
[2:00:47] here in the debauched world we're seeing
[2:00:51] everybody's thoughts are continually
[2:00:53] evil indeed as it was in the days of
[2:00:55] Noah yeah oh look at all this
[2:00:57] homosexuality and all that as it was in
[2:00:59] the days of lot yeah yeah the conditions
[2:01:02] yeah are made allowed get life is
[2:01:06] bursting
[2:01:08] forth but people are falling
[2:01:11] away
[2:01:12] yeah scripture Our hurs oh God it's the
[2:01:18] conditions that are spoken yeah that's
[2:01:20] right
[2:01:24] for one
[2:01:25] purpose for one purpose so that his seed
[2:01:29] can lay in the presence of the Sun and
[2:01:33] break into Rapture amen that's why the
[2:01:36] conditions are this way they have to be
[2:01:39] this way I look at the way the politics
[2:01:41] and such are going and I see all the
[2:01:43] intertwining I've never seen I said to
[2:01:44] my wife I've never seen if I could go
[2:01:47] back in my in my short little period of
[2:01:48] time I can go back in history and I look
[2:01:51] at the Dark Ages I can look at all the
[2:01:52] Catholic church and how it was so
[2:01:54] intertwined politics and the church I
[2:01:56] mean it was under the in the name of God
[2:01:57] they were doing a whole many things but
[2:01:58] it was all political okay I can see that
[2:02:01] I mean it's like clear as day all of you
[2:02:03] can read the history books you read the
[2:02:04] message you go through the church you
[2:02:05] can see the the politics so interwoven
[2:02:07] into religion but in the scripture It
[2:02:10] also says in Revelations 13 to Powers
[2:02:12] raise up and in this day and this hour
[2:02:15] I've never seen the
[2:02:17] interweaving of civil and ecclesiastical
[2:02:20] so blatant
[2:02:24] that's right so blatant
[2:02:27] wow it has to be this
[2:02:32] way but we've been given a message we've
[2:02:35] been given Optics from a prophet but a
[2:02:38] Bisal preach Prophet optic years ago to
[2:02:41] see so that we can see what's
[2:02:44] coming so then you say wait a second the
[2:02:47] conditions are just right
[2:02:50] Glory amen we're living in the
[2:02:54] conditions that are just right that's
[2:02:57] why it's like is it today you know I
[2:02:59] walk out I would I took a little clip I
[2:03:01] told the congregation back home I little
[2:03:03] clip of my uncle that was uh passed away
[2:03:05] in a car wreck many years ago and I took
[2:03:07] a little clip of that and it just
[2:03:08] brought brought it to my mind I said
[2:03:09] wait a second could I just it could it
[2:03:12] just be days away that I'll see him
[2:03:15] amen it's
[2:03:17] time oh things will change as I told the
[2:03:20] young people last night in emergencies
[2:03:21] all priorities gets moved off the table
[2:03:23] when something comes up I'll tell you
[2:03:24] when that happens everything's off the
[2:03:28] table man it's it's different time amen
[2:03:32] it's it's home time all your worries and
[2:03:34] all your troubles and all your work
[2:03:36] issues and all of this family it's all
[2:03:37] gone
[2:03:40] yeah amen that's what I'm living for
[2:03:43] amen where am I here I am almost
[2:03:50] done the says the world has to be in a
[2:03:53] certain position for this to happen a
[2:03:57] certain place so that we can he says
[2:03:59] that actually continues the quote he
[2:04:00] says see it always pulls away from it
[2:04:02] the Shu and it pushes the seed he goes
[2:04:04] there can't be no more he said it's
[2:04:05] wheat now he said but here at this time
[2:04:07] he says but we're plenty green uh-huh he
[2:04:10] says that's right have to lay in the
[2:04:12] presence of the sun to be mellowed up he
[2:04:14] said plenty green we haven't got
[2:04:16] sincerity and sacredness and I thought
[2:04:18] Lord that was
[2:04:19] 65 have we been laying in the presence
[2:04:21] of the sun long enough to we that sweet
[2:04:25] golden brown color that's where we are
[2:04:28] we've been laying in that he was looking
[2:04:29] at it then but you know I was thinking
[2:04:31] in the days you know brother Bram talks
[2:04:33] about Kennedy and and and and all of
[2:04:35] that and he was speaking about all the
[2:04:36] the different politics then and Ahab and
[2:04:38] Jezebel and giv the type and I was
[2:04:40] thinking Lord if he was seeing plenty
[2:04:41] green at that moment what else was
[2:04:43] plenty green if it was if you're looking
[2:04:45] at Kennedy and all of that it was it was
[2:04:47] green he was looking at Elvis Presley
[2:04:48] and and Pat Boon and you look back like
[2:04:50] man that wasn't terrible at all but he
[2:04:52] was looking further of what was to come
[2:04:54] he was looking at he was speaking about
[2:04:55] homosexuality like it was like it was
[2:04:57] now and I can't imagine the people
[2:04:58] sitting there in the chair and me
[2:05:00] like man I'm just not wow I don't is
[2:05:03] that like that I mean this was nuclear
[2:05:05] family stuff you know Mom Dad dog child
[2:05:07] you know son daughter was all perfect
[2:05:09] back in the 50s but he was seeing it was
[2:05:11] in his Green State but he was looking
[2:05:13] forward into its Golden State the now
[2:05:15] State he was seeing further so if the
[2:05:17] bride was green then and the world was
[2:05:20] green then what about now you're seeing
[2:05:22] rock and roll media like you never seen
[2:05:24] you're seeing the the homosexuality like
[2:05:25] you've never seen you're seeing the
[2:05:27] politics like you've never seen it's
[2:05:29] golden brown time for them they've
[2:05:31] matured but so as this bride we have
[2:05:35] matured under a pure word in this
[2:05:39] hour Hallelujah Pentecost hadn't matured
[2:05:43] yet it was in its green but here we
[2:05:47] are
[2:05:49] hallu amen
[2:05:52] this is mature
[2:05:56] time I can hear the
[2:05:59] Buckboard
[2:06:01] coming she went through all that time of
[2:06:04] preparing getting ready when he said I'm
[2:06:06] coming for you it wasn't the hour it was
[2:06:09] a little green it was premature but I'm
[2:06:12] coming and so then she prepared and she
[2:06:14] labored and she got herself ready and
[2:06:16] she got that little dress wear ready for
[2:06:18] her and she started to put on the robe
[2:06:20] of the word of her hour she started to
[2:06:22] make sure she was dressed just right she
[2:06:24] had her veil just on her stockings were
[2:06:26] right her shoes were all shiny she
[2:06:28] prepared herself so then when it came
[2:06:30] the right hour she was ready it was the
[2:06:33] mature hour and she could listen wait a
[2:06:36] second amen the world scorned her the
[2:06:38] denomination shunned her they pushed her

[2:06:46] rail but I can tell you the Buckboard I
[2:06:49] can hear the Buckboard coming and if you
[2:06:52] can just say wait a second that's where
[2:06:54] I'm at I'm at that hour who really cares
[2:06:56] about anything else right all that
[2:06:58] matters is the
[2:06:59] dust I see some dust coming what that

[2:07:11] position for a

[2:07:37] yeah and his word
[2:07:40] says if I could take another prong off
[2:07:42] of the center of
[2:07:45] thought you and I live in a
[2:07:49] carrier yeah

[2:08:11] life it's carrying something right and
[2:08:15] this flesh is carrying what I tell you
[2:08:17] what it's carrying it's carrying the
[2:08:19] word amen but Ram says when you become
[2:08:23] subject to that Spirit it throws your
[2:08:24] whole being subject to that spirit and
[2:08:26] that spirit is nothing in the world but
[2:08:27] this seed word made manifest or
[2:08:29] quickened made alive he said don't do

[2:09:01] flesh it's in contact with this Earthly
[2:09:04] realm yeah these senses but there's
[2:09:07] another body a word body that I bypassed
[2:09:13] that I have to connect with and this
[2:09:15] fleshly body is only but a carrier for
