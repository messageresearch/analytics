[40:19] call our brother Tim Puit to come
[40:21] tonight, he's going to be speaking for
[40:22] us. We certainly are highly honored that
[40:25] he would take time to come here to True
[40:28] Word Tabernacle and uh he has a church
[40:31] at home. He's got a large assembly. He
[40:33] has a lot of responsibilities.
[40:36] uh he don't need any place to preach,
[40:38] but he's took
[40:41] grace and come here tonight to dedicate
[40:46] these few moments to to true word to you
[40:50] believers that he'd be able to speak
[40:52] something to be a help to you. And I I
[40:54] personally have been listening to
[40:55] brother Tim preach since I was a little
[40:57] boy. First time I remember we figured it
[40:59] up. I think I was about three years old
[41:01] when he came in and preached in Arkansas
[41:03] in that little church. And all I
[41:05] remembered is that guy in that cast sure
[41:07] could preach. I was a little boy. I
[41:10] remember he preached the house down the
[41:11] fire of God be to fall. And all the
[41:14] years uh that we've known brother Tim
[41:17] and fellowship with him. I call him my
[41:19] drinking buddy. We we get together, we
[41:22] get drunk in the anointing and we
[41:24] slobber and dance and praise God and
[41:27] because we believe in that kind of
[41:28] thing.
[41:30] We believe in that kind of thing. Amen.
[41:33] Uh you know, I uh I'll say there's one
[41:36] one thing that has been a tremendous a
[41:39] tremendous blessing through the years.
[41:41] Brother Tim's a word preacher, but he is
[41:44] not just a one-sided uh preacher, not
[41:47] just the word only, but he believes in
[41:49] the dynamics. Praise God. You know, and
[41:52] I certainly believe tonight that the
[41:54] gospel that God has delivered to the
[41:55] church in the end time is a gospel of
[41:58] power.
[41:59] Uh when you're when you were in school
[42:02] and brother Earl, they they learned you
[42:03] early that energy is given to you in two
[42:06] different forms. And one of them
[42:08] energies is called potential energy.
[42:10] It's that's kind of why you get a little
[42:12] heavy. You get it's a lot of potential.
[42:14] You know, you eat food. You eat food and
[42:18] it stores in and it is potential energy.
[42:23] But the energy you use that is acting
[42:25] energy is called kinetic.
[42:28] And the message of the hour is kinetic.
[42:30] It's not potential alone. It has a power
[42:33] in it. And I believe that the power of
[42:36] this gospel can change your life. If you
[42:38] come in this building tonight and you do
[42:40] not have to leave like he came. Amen.
[42:43] You can leave. You can leave it under
[42:44] the inspiration of the anointing of God
[42:47] and bless him. And I I certainly believe
[42:49] tonight that uh brother Tim as he would
[42:51] come. I I I want to give him full
[42:53] liberty. I want him to let that let that
[42:56] anointing loose. And Amen. There's a
[42:59] Joshua on the inside. Brother Bram said
[43:01] that and Joshua used the sword of the
[43:04] word to fight. So if we pull on that
[43:07] gift and the Joshua in him gets a hold
[43:09] of that sword. Amen. It'll take a hold
[43:12] of every spirit that's binding you,
[43:14] it'll cut the church loose. They'll have
[43:16] a freedom like they've never had.
[43:18] There'll be healings that'll happen in
[43:20] this meeting tonight. People will walk
[43:21] away from here and they'll say, "Oh my,
[43:24] wouldn't it so powerful when the word
[43:26] was coming across us and setting us
[43:29] free?" Amen. I I certainly I certainly
[43:33] uh want to make welcome the man of God
[43:37] tonight and most definitely want to make
[43:39] welcome the one that's on the inside of
[43:42] him. Won't you stand to your feet with
[43:44] us tonight as as he would come. Amen.
[43:48] Brother uh being there is a song uh we
[43:51] used to sing that he's all I
[43:56] need. Now he is everything you need
[43:59] tonight.
[44:00] You may think there's something else you
[44:02] need, but he's the one. That's what you
[44:04] need.
[44:07] Won't you invite him right now?
[44:11] [Music]
[44:13] Jesus is
[44:16] all I
[44:22] need. He's
[44:26] all I need.
[44:29] [Applause]
[44:30] He's
[44:33] all I
[44:37] need.
[44:40] Jesus is
[44:43] all I
[44:45] need. Praise the
[44:48] Lord. He
[44:50] is
[44:53] all I need.
[44:57] He is
[44:59] all I
[45:04] need.
[45:07] Jesus is
[45:09] all that I
[45:15] need. He is
[45:19] all I
[45:22] need. He's
[45:26] all I
[45:29] [Music]
[45:30] need.
[45:33] Jesus is
[45:35] all I need.
[45:40] If you have a need tonight, raise your
[45:42] hand to God and let's just take it to
[45:45] him. Father, we are your children and we
[45:49] have gathered in your name tonight.
[45:52] We're so thankful for the grace that is
[45:54] on our lives. For your mercy that
[45:57] endures forever,
[46:00] for the power of the gospel that has
[46:03] lifted us up out of sin and made us sons
[46:06] and daughters of God. We're asking Lord
[46:09] for your anointing tonight to come Lord
[46:13] that you would just speak to hearts and
[46:15] lives and you reveal yourself through
[46:18] the word God that as the scripture is
[46:22] open that you'll just step forth from
[46:24] them to the hearts of your children
[46:27] tonight. Bring healing and deliverance.
[46:30] Bring salvation. Lord, bring the the the
[46:34] Holy Spirit so real that people are just
[46:38] saturated with your presence. Lord, that
[46:40] when we would leave from here, Lord,
[46:42] that we would be able to say we have
[46:45] been in the presence of the almighty
[46:48] God. We're asking your blessings, Lord,
[46:51] upon us today.
[46:53] Oh God, your grace upon these lives,
[46:55] these hands that went up before you,
[46:58] Lord, no matter how weak of faith we
[47:01] are, we look not at our faith, we look
[47:05] at your divine promise. And I ask, Lord,
[47:08] that you'll reach further down than what
[47:11] we can reach up and you'll lift us up
[47:14] out of the situations we are in and
[47:17] bring a deliverance to your children.
[47:19] Lord, I want to thank you for this
[47:22] church. I want to thank you for his
[47:24] pastors, Lord, the ministers that are
[47:27] here. And I know there's quite a number
[47:29] of them. Lord, I I pray you'll bless
[47:32] each one. May each one, Lord, be
[47:35] anointed with a with a higher burning of
[47:38] the lick of fire that they have in their
[47:41] lives. May they be ignited by the gospel
[47:44] of peace. Lord, impress the battle all
[47:47] the way to the end.
[47:49] Lord, those that are weary and feeble
[47:51] and Lord, low in their spirits, will you
[47:54] just lift them up tonight? We ask it in
[47:57] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Praise the
[48:02] Lord. God bless
[48:04] you. Amen. It's so good to be here
[48:06] together with you to today. And I think
[48:09] while you're standing, I'm just going to
[48:11] go ahead and read a scripture. And then
[48:14] if you don't mind being this first
[48:16] service, I'll just take a few minutes
[48:18] and talk with you just a few minutes.
[48:21] And and uh but anyway, in Hebrews
[48:23] chapter 5 and verse 5 said, "So also
[48:28] Christ glorified not himself to be made
[48:32] an high priest, but he that said unto
[48:35] him, thou art my son, today I have
[48:38] begotten thee."
[48:39] as he sat also in another place, thou
[48:43] art a priest forever after the order of
[48:46] Melzdc. Amen. Who in the days of his
[48:49] flesh, when he had offered up prayers
[48:51] and supplications, with strong crying
[48:54] and tears unto him that was able to save
[48:57] him from death, and was heard in that
[48:59] which he that he feared, though he were
[49:02] a son, yet learned he obedience by the
[49:06] things which he suffered. And being made
[49:09] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[49:12] salvation unto all them that obey him.
[49:16] Yes. Called of God and high priest after
[49:19] the order of
[49:21] Mechazdc. Amen. God bless you. Can be
[49:23] seated. Amen. I certainly glad to be
[49:27] here tonight and be able to share these
[49:30] moments with you this weekend and
[49:32] looking forward to the presence of the
[49:35] Lord. Good to be with my friend, Brother
[49:37] Ron Spencer. Amen. Here again. And as
[49:40] you know, we've just had some uh great
[49:43] trials yet great victories along the
[49:46] road. And Amen. the Lord's been with him
[49:48] every step of the way. His grace is so
[49:52] great upon us. And I just want to say I
[49:55] I so appreciate the ministry here,
[49:59] Brother Ray Ericson. He's been a friend
[50:01] of mine a long, long time. and and a
[50:04] faithful servant of God. Brother Wayne
[50:06] Lawson is a dynamic minister of this
[50:09] gospel with a supernatural touch to his
[50:13] ministry. And and of course, Brother
[50:15] Nathan Ericson was just with us not too
[50:18] long ago, just a few weeks ago. And I
[50:21] tell you what, you're a blessed people.
[50:24] You are tremendously blessed to have
[50:27] just not just ministry, but the quality
[50:29] of ministry that you have. Amen. You're
[50:33] so very blessed. I don't know if you
[50:36] know how blessed you are, but God's
[50:38] grace is great on you and we thank God
[50:41] for that. And you know, recently you had
[50:45] a a homegoing of a a great pioneer of
[50:49] this message and that was brother Samuel
[50:52] Johnson. And uh you know I know he was
[50:56] up in Michigan there but uh you know his
[50:59] the effects of his ministry has reached
[51:01] way down and it and it even touched my
[51:03] life and um you know he you know back
[51:07] you know back in the um many years ago
[51:10] back in the '9s actually I I had a I had
[51:14] a dream where I saw several prominent
[51:17] ministers pass off the scene and one of
[51:21] them was brother Samuel Johnson. And um
[51:24] in this dream that I I saw people, you
[51:28] know, gathered around him as he was
[51:30] being sent off and and was leaving and
[51:33] they were singing like an ode to him of
[51:37] of all the great deeds that he did to
[51:39] the Lord. And and I I thought about, you
[51:42] know, your recent um memorial services
[51:45] for him. And uh no doubt great
[51:49] testimonies of the great missionary
[51:51] works and mission works tapes after
[51:55] cassette tapes that were sent around the
[51:58] world and books that was shared and the
[52:01] message you know we thank God for those
[52:03] pioneers. You know I believe that not
[52:06] only did you give him a great send off
[52:08] here but I believe it was a warm welcome
[52:12] there in heaven for him. Amen. And as he
[52:15] entered there, I'm sure that he was
[52:17] gathered around by many of the believers
[52:20] on the other side. And you know,
[52:23] I you know, I've um I'm not as young as
[52:27] what I used to be. Uh and um I've passed
[52:31] a milestone this this past year in
[52:35] September and turned 70. Don't tell
[52:37] nobody. But I'm just a few years older
[52:39] than Brother Ron here. But um yeah, lead
[52:44] him out by about seven, I think. But
[52:46] anyway, I've got an old friend over
[52:48] there, Brother Johnny Green. I heard
[52:50] your voice back there. I said, "That's
[52:52] got to be Johnny Green." So I heard you
[52:54] back there. God bless you, man. That you
[52:57] know, just to be together with God's
[52:59] wonderful people, it's it's such a
[53:02] privilege. Recently, I had a dream not
[53:05] too long ago. I I I dreamed that I went
[53:07] to heaven and I stood before the
[53:10] entrance waiting to enter through those
[53:13] big gates there and and an angel went
[53:17] and um got the book to see if I could
[53:20] come in and he opened up the books and
[53:25] it was like he took and run his fingers
[53:28] down the record looking for something
[53:32] and and he must have found my name
[53:34] because When he found my name, he looked
[53:37] back and turned to me and said, "It's
[53:40] not your time to come here."
[53:43] And he then he told me, he said, "You
[53:45] must go back." And he gave me
[53:48] instructions that I was to rest more.
[53:51] And he added, "Don't be angry."
[53:56] Well, I I was really puzzled about this
[53:58] meeting. You know, I So, I just thought
[54:03] I would do what it said. I went to a
[54:05] cabin on a lake and I rested and for
[54:08] about 3 days and I watched the waves
[54:11] come in and I felt the breeze and you
[54:13] know contemplated on what I was told to
[54:15] do. I I said well I I didn't really know
[54:19] I needed to rest like this but I guess I
[54:21] did. And after a few days I returned
[54:24] back home and I was still contemplating
[54:27] on what that dream might mean.
[54:29] And as I was meditating and praying more
[54:33] about it, I I realized it wasn't
[54:36] physical rest I needed, but it's resting
[54:39] on the promise.
[54:41] It's meditating on what God said in his
[54:44] holy book. And then resting on every
[54:47] promise, knowing this, that Jesus never
[54:51] fails. Or he said, "Heavens and earth
[54:53] will pass away, but my word will not
[54:56] fail."
[54:57] And that's what we must do in life. It's
[55:00] we we must enter into rest and and that
[55:04] means don't get anxious about things.
[55:06] Don't get worried and don't get fearful
[55:09] and don't be afraid. God's got this. You
[55:13] know, rest is when we're not frustrated
[55:16] and discouraged and angry, but we're
[55:18] just patiently waiting for the promise
[55:20] to be fulfilled. Amen. You know, we all
[55:24] go through life's journeys and we all
[55:26] have our different trials and I suffered
[55:29] loss. I buried my heart when I buried my
[55:32] wife for 45 years and and uh this is
[55:35] would been our 50th year now. And we had
[55:37] a wonderful marriage and four beautiful
[55:40] children and 10 lovely grandchildren and
[55:43] you know Karen Sister Karen had a brain
[55:45] bleed and blood was filling her head and
[55:47] it was making hard for her to
[55:49] communicate. Um, and we had our last
[55:52] talk together in the ER of the hospital.
[55:55] And as we shared our thoughts with each
[55:58] other and I held her hand and I said,
[56:00] "You know, we've had 45 years of a
[56:03] wonderful marriage together and I have
[56:06] no regrets." And she said, "Yes, Tim. I
[56:10] have no regrets. I've had a wonderful
[56:12] life and I'm ready to meet the Lord. No
[56:16] regrets. That's wonderful words to
[56:19] conclude life. You know, it's hard
[56:22] walking alone and sometimes it's really
[56:26] easy to get upset and angry about where
[56:29] we find ourselves in life.
[56:32] But really, why get angry? We are so
[56:35] blessed. So instead of being angry, I
[56:39] focusing on my blessings.
[56:41] God help me as I follow his instruction
[56:44] of not being angry but just resting on
[56:47] his promise. You see, the world we live
[56:49] in, they have a mistaken view of of what
[56:52] it means to rest. Rest isn't going on
[56:56] vacation. It's not getting eight hours
[56:58] of sleep. You know, Jesus said, "Come
[57:01] unto me and I'll give you rest." You
[57:04] see, rest is really an active exchange.
[57:08] Your burden, his rest.
[57:11] So the world says that true rest is just
[57:14] complete disengagement from everything.
[57:17] But Jesus said rest is complete
[57:20] engagement. So engagement with the
[57:23] person of Jesus Christ for he is your
[57:26] restgiver. He is your burdenbearer.
[57:29] So you cast your cares on him for he
[57:32] carth for you. You humble yourself under
[57:35] the mighty hand of God and he will lift
[57:38] you up. So I that's why I come to the
[57:41] Lord saying, "Jesus, I just humble
[57:44] myself. I cast my cares on you. You care
[57:47] for me. I can't do all this by myself,
[57:50] but Lord, I want to make an exchange my
[57:53] burden for your rest."
[57:56] And if you can only realize in your
[57:58] situation whether you've had a death
[58:00] notice of cancer or you've had a bad
[58:03] wicked past or whether you've been
[58:05] abused or mistreated or just stop for a
[58:08] minute and rest on his promise. Say yeah
[58:11] God knew about this all about it and
[58:14] this is the path he has used to bring me
[58:18] to him. So oh God let me find rest in
[58:23] all of your promises. Amen. Don't you
[58:26] want to do that? If you'll look with me
[58:28] to Revelation 5 and verse one, we'll go
[58:31] into the scripture. You're such a nice
[58:34] people and a wonderful congregation to
[58:38] talk to and I could spend a lot of time
[58:40] doing that, but let's just go to the
[58:42] word. Revelation 5 and verse one.
[58:46] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[58:48] sat on the throne a book written and on
[58:52] the backside sealed with seven seals.
[58:55] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[58:58] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[59:01] the book and to loose the seals thereof.
[59:05] And no man in heaven nor in earth,
[59:07] neither under the earth was able to open
[59:09] the book, neither to look thereon. And I
[59:12] wept much because no man was found
[59:16] worthy to open and to read the book,
[59:18] neither to look thereon. And one of the
[59:21] elders said unto me, "Weep not, behold,
[59:24] the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root
[59:26] of David, have prevailed to open the
[59:28] book, and to loose the seven seals
[59:31] thereof." And I beheld, and lo, in the
[59:34] midst of the throne, and of the four
[59:37] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[59:39] stood a lamb, as it had been slain,
[59:43] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[59:46] are the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[59:49] into all the earth. And he came and took
[59:52] the book out of the right hand of him
[59:54] that sat upon the throne.
[59:56] When he had taken the book, the four
[1:00:00] beasts and the four and 20 elders fell
[1:00:02] down before the lamb, having every one
[1:00:05] of them harps and golden vials full of
[1:00:08] odors, which are the prayers of the
[1:00:10] saints. And they sung a new song,
[1:00:13] saying, Thou art worthy to take the
[1:00:16] book, and to open the seals thereof, for
[1:00:19] thou was slain, and has redeemed us to
[1:00:22] God by thy blood. out of every kindred
[1:00:26] and tongue and people and nation, and
[1:00:30] hath made us unto our gods, kings and
[1:00:34] priests.
[1:00:35] And we shall reign on the earth. Amen.
[1:00:40] Amen. I'm going to speak to you tonight
[1:00:42] on kings and priests. You know what
[1:00:45] you're seeing here is Jesus in the
[1:00:48] priest king office of Melzdc. That's
[1:00:51] what's in Revelation 5. And you can see
[1:00:55] and kind of understand why it's so
[1:00:58] important for us to know who is this
[1:01:01] MelzDC.
[1:01:03] So that we could see his continued work
[1:01:06] as a priest. You know, the call was for
[1:01:09] a worthy man, but it couldn't be any
[1:01:11] man. You see, it would have to be a man
[1:01:14] that was actually called in the order of
[1:01:16] MelzDC,
[1:01:18] who was both priest and king. And in the
[1:01:21] structure of the Old Testament, as God
[1:01:24] dealt with Israel, the priesthood was of
[1:01:26] the tribe of Levi. And no one could come
[1:01:30] and and just decide, I'm going to be a
[1:01:32] priest. You know, I I'm a Jew. I'm an
[1:01:34] Israelite. I I'll be a priest, too. No.
[1:01:37] You know, even if he was a Hebrew and a
[1:01:40] bonafideed seed of Abraham,
[1:01:43] only one of the tribe of Levi could be a
[1:01:47] priest. you know, and you couldn't mix
[1:01:50] the offices. So, if you were a priest in
[1:01:53] Israel, you could not you was not of the
[1:01:55] kingline. And if you was a king, you
[1:01:57] could not operate as a priest. But there
[1:02:00] was a king in 2 Chronicles, which was
[1:02:03] Josiah and he was a a great king and
[1:02:06] successful and powerful king. But when
[1:02:09] he became strong, there was pride that
[1:02:11] lifted up in in his heart and it led to
[1:02:14] his downfall. He entered into the temple
[1:02:17] of the Lord to burn the incense on the
[1:02:19] altar. Something that was reserved
[1:02:22] strictly for the priests, the sons of
[1:02:25] Aaron. And Aariah the priest and and
[1:02:28] there was 80 other courageous priests.
[1:02:30] They confronted him, tried to stop him,
[1:02:32] and and Uzziah became angry. And at that
[1:02:35] moment,
[1:02:36] leprosy broke out on his forehead, and
[1:02:39] he had to live in isolation till the day
[1:02:41] he died. And this is a vivid reminder of
[1:02:45] the danger of stepping outside of God's
[1:02:49] divine order, especially in worship and
[1:02:52] in priestly function. But you see, a
[1:02:55] priest in the order of Melzdc, he could
[1:02:58] be a priest and a king because you see
[1:03:01] when when um Abraham met him, he was
[1:03:04] king of Salem and priest of the most
[1:03:06] high God. And so in that line, they
[1:03:09] could be both priest and kings. And when
[1:03:11] John looked to see this lion, he didn't
[1:03:15] see a lion. He saw a lamb. And that lamb
[1:03:20] was representing God's priesthood. And
[1:03:23] the intercessory work which he continues
[1:03:26] even in the tribulation now, not for the
[1:03:29] Gentiles, but for the Jews. For he is
[1:03:31] lamb, redeemer, intercessor. Even when
[1:03:35] that's all finished for the Gentiles and
[1:03:37] he turns to Israel, then for the
[1:03:40] Gentiles, of course, he that is filthy
[1:03:42] be filthy still. He that's holy be holy
[1:03:44] still. He that's righteous be righteous
[1:03:46] still. But still his role even in the
[1:03:49] tribulation period will be the role of
[1:03:53] the lamb.
[1:03:55] Amen. And he will not only do that in
[1:03:57] the role of the lamb, but if you if
[1:03:59] you'll watch it, it's even in that he
[1:04:01] will do not only his intercessory work
[1:04:03] working with the Jews, but he will also
[1:04:06] continue on with with his avenging work
[1:04:11] as he is a kinsman avenger. And so it's
[1:04:14] the wrath of the lamb that is poured out
[1:04:17] in the tribulation. Amen. So you see
[1:04:20] intercessory consent continues all the
[1:04:22] way to the white throne.
[1:04:25] and judgment. And on the other side, on
[1:04:28] the other side, the millennium all the
[1:04:30] way through the millennium, it's it is
[1:04:32] still the lamb that is working now. And
[1:04:35] of course, then he will show himself as
[1:04:38] king as he reigns with his bride in the
[1:04:42] great millennial reign, showing himself
[1:04:44] as son of David. But even now, the
[1:04:47] intercessory power of the blood is what
[1:04:50] we overcome Satan by. There is no other
[1:04:54] way that we can we can overcome except
[1:04:57] by the blood of the lamb. For as the
[1:05:01] bride of sins, Satan is cast down and
[1:05:05] they overcome him by the blood of the
[1:05:08] lamb and by the word of his testimony.
[1:05:11] Amen. Now, by the blood of the lamb,
[1:05:13] that means because of or on account of
[1:05:15] or by the virtue of that blood being
[1:05:18] shed. Had not that blood been shed,
[1:05:21] Satan's accusations would have been
[1:05:24] unanswerable.
[1:05:26] Amen. But but as it is, that blood meets
[1:05:30] every charge against us.
[1:05:33] Amen. And as long as we are in this
[1:05:36] fleshly body, we need the intercession
[1:05:39] of the blood of the intercessory lamb.
[1:05:42] Amen. And John hears that the lamb of
[1:05:46] the tribe of Judah or the lion of the
[1:05:48] tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the
[1:05:52] book. And he turns to look to see this
[1:05:55] lion. Yeah. And he sees a lamb.
[1:05:59] I think that's so wonderful
[1:06:02] because when he looks at him, he doesn't
[1:06:04] see him before a throne of judgment.
[1:06:06] right? No, he doesn't see him as a judge
[1:06:11] with condemnation, but he sees him as a
[1:06:14] lamb, as a mediator, as an intercessor,
[1:06:17] and he had been slain and punished and
[1:06:19] judged as one who had taken his
[1:06:23] punishment.
[1:06:25] Amen. Hallelujah. So he said he has
[1:06:28] redeemed us to God by every blood by by
[1:06:30] that blood out of every kindred tongue
[1:06:32] and people and nation and has made us
[1:06:34] under our God kings and priest and we
[1:06:37] shall reign on the earth. Brother
[1:06:39] Brandham captured this thought as he
[1:06:42] spoke on the church ages and and he he
[1:06:45] says that
[1:06:47] that and he made it clear that we are
[1:06:49] called to be priests with him. Of
[1:06:52] course, not in the order of Aaron
[1:06:55] because we would have to be an Israelite
[1:06:56] of the tribe of Levi to do that, but in
[1:06:58] the order of Melzdc
[1:07:00] who is both priest and king. And so in
[1:07:04] Revelation 1 and 16 and he said, "And he
[1:07:06] hath made us kings and priests unto God
[1:07:11] and his father, and to him be glory and
[1:07:14] dominion forever and ever." Amen.
[1:07:17] Hallelujah. You can remember this from
[1:07:19] the church age book when brother
[1:07:21] Brandham expounded. He hath made us. Did
[1:07:25] you catch it? He hath made us. Not man,
[1:07:29] not some preacher, not religion, not
[1:07:31] your works, not your efforts. He did it.
[1:07:34] God made you kings and priests.
[1:07:39] This is his doing. Salvation is not what
[1:07:42] we earned. It is something that heaven
[1:07:44] declared over us.
[1:07:46] I have made you this. And I tell you,
[1:07:49] when God makes you something, ain't no
[1:07:51] devil in hell can take it out of you.
[1:07:56] Salvation is of the Lord. And it's not a
[1:07:59] patchup job. It's It's a complete
[1:08:02] transformation.
[1:08:04] He didn't just forgive you. He redefined
[1:08:08] you. He gave you a new identity. Amen.
[1:08:12] He made you something the world can't
[1:08:14] understand.
[1:08:16] Hallelujah. You are a new creation and
[1:08:18] you are a brand new species.
[1:08:22] Hallelujah.
[1:08:24] He has redeemed us by his blood. He
[1:08:28] brought us with a purpose.
[1:08:31] And that purpose is not to blend in with
[1:08:33] Babylon and the confusion out here, but
[1:08:37] to reign and to minister as kings and
[1:08:40] priests. Amen. Romans 5:17 said, "Thou
[1:08:44] which receive abundance of grace and the
[1:08:47] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[1:08:50] life by one Jesus Christ." Notice what
[1:08:54] he said. We that have received grace.
[1:08:57] And the gift of righteousness, we shall
[1:09:00] reign.
[1:09:01] Reign. Rule.
[1:09:04] Are you with me? We're not waiting for a
[1:09:05] crown someday.
[1:09:07] We're wearing spiritual crowns right
[1:09:10] now.
[1:09:11] You should know that because in
[1:09:13] Revelation 4:10, the bride of the Old
[1:09:15] and New Testament, represented by the 4
[1:09:17] and 24 elders, there they fall down
[1:09:20] before him that sat on the throne and
[1:09:22] worshiped him that lived forever and
[1:09:24] cast their crowns before the throne.
[1:09:29] Amen. So, we are already presently right
[1:09:34] now crowned kings positioned in power
[1:09:39] and authority. crowned with the Holy
[1:09:42] Ghost.
[1:09:44] That's who we are. We reign in life.
[1:09:47] Yes, sir. Over sin. Over shame, over the
[1:09:51] lies of the enemy, over our past, even
[1:09:54] over our future. We reign. Amen. You are
[1:09:58] not a slave to your past. You are a king
[1:10:01] in the now.
[1:10:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:10:07] Colossians 1:13 says, "Who hath
[1:10:10] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:10:12] and hath translated us into the
[1:10:16] kingdom."
[1:10:18] Amen. Into the kingdom of his dear son.
[1:10:22] He didn't just pull you out of darkness.
[1:10:24] He placed you in the kingdom. Amen.
[1:10:27] Amen. And you've been translated,
[1:10:30] transformed,
[1:10:31] transplanted, placed, positioned into a
[1:10:35] kingdom that cannot be shaken.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah. Amen. And the kingdom can't
[1:10:41] be shaken. You can't be shaken out of
[1:10:43] it.
[1:10:45] You don't belong to the world, you
[1:10:46] belong to the king. You don't walk like
[1:10:49] the world. You don't think like the
[1:10:51] world. You don't talk like the world.
[1:10:52] You don't bow to the world. You live in
[1:10:55] a higher realm.
[1:10:58] That's who you are. You have dominion.
[1:11:01] Yes, sir. Not someday. Right now,
[1:11:05] dominion over sin. Dominion over fear.
[1:11:08] Dominion over depression. Amen. Dominion
[1:11:12] over lust. Dominion over the flesh.
[1:11:15] Dominion over the prince of of darkness.
[1:11:18] Come on. You are people of dominion. You
[1:11:20] are to walk in dominion.
[1:11:22] Amen.
[1:11:25] And he's made us priest. Yes, sir. Oh,
[1:11:28] yes. You're not just royalty. You're
[1:11:31] holy royalty.
[1:11:33] A priestly king.
[1:11:35] Amen. You're not just sitting on the
[1:11:38] throne. You're standing at the altar as
[1:11:40] a priest.
[1:11:42] Amen. You offer up sacrifices of praise.
[1:11:46] You offer your life like a sweet smell
[1:11:49] of incense before the throne. Your lips
[1:11:52] are sanctified. Come on. Amen. Your
[1:11:55] prayers are heard. Your intercession is
[1:11:57] powerful. Because you are a priest unto
[1:12:00] your God. God has made you a priest. And
[1:12:04] in fact, your effectual, fervent prayer
[1:12:07] avaleth much before God. For the prayer
[1:12:11] of faith will save the sick and God will
[1:12:14] raise them up. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:12:19] 1 Peter 2:9 said, "But you are a chosen
[1:12:22] generation." That word really means
[1:12:24] offspring. You're a chosen offspring, a
[1:12:28] royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[1:12:32] peculiar people. Amen. Not no wonder the
[1:12:36] world doesn't appear to us. We've seen
[1:12:39] something greater.
[1:12:41] Amen. We are peculiar, not because we're
[1:12:43] strange. A lot of people try to act odd.
[1:12:46] You don't have to act odd to be a
[1:12:48] Christian. We're not peculiar because
[1:12:50] we're strong, but because we're marked,
[1:12:52] we're sealed. We're separated. We're set
[1:12:54] apart. We are filled. We're
[1:12:56] commissioned. Amen. And maybe that's why
[1:12:59] some think us to be strange because
[1:13:01] we're not of this world. We're totally
[1:13:03] unworldly. That's right.
[1:13:06] Amen. We're from another realm and we
[1:13:09] got dominion over the flesh, the world,
[1:13:11] and the devil.
[1:13:13] And what do kings do? They rule.
[1:13:17] They take dominion.
[1:13:19] What the priests do? They minister. They
[1:13:21] intercede. Right. And there's power in
[1:13:24] intercession.
[1:13:26] In as much as Paul says in Romans 8 says
[1:13:29] the spirit will take over your voice,
[1:13:31] making intercessions with groanings that
[1:13:33] cannot be uttered. And what do sons and
[1:13:36] daughters of God do? They reflect his
[1:13:38] glory. They walk in his image. Amen. And
[1:13:41] as priests, they carry his holy fire as
[1:13:44] light in the darkness. And as kings,
[1:13:46] they take dominion over hell itself.
[1:13:49] Amen. And I'm telling you right now,
[1:13:51] it's your it's your place as a king to
[1:13:54] take dominion, to exercise control over
[1:13:57] the kingdom God has given you. You're
[1:14:00] sons and daughters of the great king.
[1:14:02] You carry the name of Jesus Christ to
[1:14:06] which every knee has to bow and every
[1:14:09] tongue has to confess that he is Lord,
[1:14:13] supreme ruler over all.
[1:14:19] Yes, sir. Glory to God. No wonder we're
[1:14:22] zealous into good works. We've been
[1:14:25] recreated in Christ Jesus. What for? To
[1:14:28] reflect the nature of our father.
[1:14:31] So don't walk like a per
[1:14:34] when you're wearing a crown.
[1:14:37] Come on. Don't go through the world
[1:14:39] stoed over and bowed down and bent down
[1:14:41] and worried and frustrated and moaning
[1:14:44] like a slave. You've been seated
[1:14:46] together in heavenly places. Amen. You
[1:14:49] got to quit that slave mentality and put
[1:14:52] off the garments of slavery. You're not
[1:14:55] slaves anymore.
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:14:59] Amen. You were slaves, but not no more.
[1:15:03] Originally, you weren't a slave either.
[1:15:05] You were God's children and royalty
[1:15:07] before the world began, but sin captured
[1:15:11] you and led you out and took you into
[1:15:13] bondage. But you are now free from that.
[1:15:18] Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] You know, Israel, when they were freed
[1:15:22] from bondage, one of the first things
[1:15:24] they did was put off the garments of
[1:15:26] their slavery.
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:30] Yes, sir. Amen. They put off the
[1:15:33] garments of their slavery. The Bible
[1:15:35] said they went out with a high hand.
[1:15:38] Oh, brother, you better you you think
[1:15:40] something now. You better watch us when
[1:15:42] we leave from here. We're not going out
[1:15:45] of here decrepit and defeated.
[1:15:48] Come on. We're going out of here with a
[1:15:50] high hand. Amen. Oh, and he says in
[1:15:55] Exodus 19:5, "Then you shall be a
[1:15:59] peculiar treasure unto me above all
[1:16:02] people, for all the earth is mine, and
[1:16:05] you shall be to me a kingdom of priest."
[1:16:08] Amen. And a holy nation.
[1:16:12] That's what he's called us to be. Amen.
[1:16:15] So don't let your lips go silent when
[1:16:17] you've been called to lift up holy hands
[1:16:20] and declare the glory of your king.
[1:16:23] To him be glory and dominion and power
[1:16:26] forever and ever. So we you know let us
[1:16:29] as priests minister before his altar.
[1:16:32] Let us as kings stand as agents of his
[1:16:34] throne. Let us as sons speak with
[1:16:37] authority. That's right. Knowing our
[1:16:39] position and knowing we have been
[1:16:41] placed. God sent a message in this day
[1:16:44] to position you to place you to adopt
[1:16:47] you as sons to put you in position.
[1:16:50] assumption where you know who you are
[1:16:53] and you know where you come from and you
[1:16:55] know where you're going. You know your
[1:16:57] heritage and you know you know what your
[1:17:00] inheritance is.
[1:17:04] The crown is on your head. The fire of
[1:17:07] the Holy Ghost in your soul. The throne
[1:17:10] room is calling. Hallelujah. It says
[1:17:12] come on. Come on to the throne room.
[1:17:14] You're a king.
[1:17:16] He hath made us unto our God, kings and
[1:17:19] priests.
[1:17:21] To do what? Offer sacrifice of praise.
[1:17:25] Amen. Uh Hebrews
[1:17:28] 3:13:15. By him, let us therefore offer
[1:17:33] the sacrifice of praise to
[1:17:36] God only when we feel good.
[1:17:40] Oh, you're not even reading that. How do
[1:17:41] you
[1:17:42] know? It says continually
[1:17:47] that is the fruit and watch now the
[1:17:50] fruit of our lips
[1:17:53] giving praise to his and thanks to his
[1:17:56] name. Amen. So you see he made us to do
[1:18:00] what? To offer a spiritual sacrifice.
[1:18:05] Now and faith is the substance. Brother
[1:18:08] Brandham our Yeah. Brother Brandham said
[1:18:10] our bodies are grown in. We have an
[1:18:12] inheritance and we're children now.
[1:18:14] Kings, the heirs of the kingdom. Oh my.
[1:18:16] Kings and priests unto God offering
[1:18:18] spiritual sacrifice. What does a priest
[1:18:21] do? Make a sacrifice. What is a
[1:18:25] spiritual sacrifice? That's what these
[1:18:27] sons and daughters do, which are kings
[1:18:30] and priests, yet not in full possession.
[1:18:33] But they're making sacrifices, offering
[1:18:36] to God, spiritual sacrifices, the fruits
[1:18:40] of our lips, giving praise to him,
[1:18:42] fruits of our lips. You say, "Brother
[1:18:45] Brandham, I just don't feel like
[1:18:47] praising him." That's the time to make a
[1:18:51] sacrifice. Praise him anyhow. Kings and
[1:18:55] priests, sons and daughters, offering
[1:18:57] spiritual sacrifices, the fruits of our
[1:19:00] lips giving praise to his name. Amen.
[1:19:03] Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Earnestly
[1:19:07] contending, he said, "We have a we're a
[1:19:09] high priest. We are high priests
[1:19:12] offering spiritual sacrifices. The
[1:19:15] fruits of our lips are giving praise to
[1:19:18] God. And may every believer now as a
[1:19:21] sacrifice of the high priest enter into
[1:19:23] the praises of God, shouting, glorifying
[1:19:27] God, and praise him. I ask this in Jesus
[1:19:30] Christ's name." Amen. And the people
[1:19:32] praise God with all their hearts and
[1:19:34] give glory to God. Listen this. This is
[1:19:36] brother Brandham's prayer. What? That
[1:19:38] every believer would enter as a
[1:19:41] sacrifice and pray. Enter into the
[1:19:43] praises of God
[1:19:45] shouting glorifying God.
[1:19:48] Amen. He said again in the seven church
[1:19:51] ages, when a little confusion comes in
[1:19:54] the church, you don't run to one side
[1:19:56] and pout. Now if you are, you're not a
[1:19:59] priest. You see, you pray through
[1:20:02] spiritual sacrifice, the fruits of our
[1:20:04] lips, giving praise to his name. See
[1:20:07] what I mean? Well, you say, "Well, I
[1:20:09] just don't feel like going to church,
[1:20:11] but you're a priest."
[1:20:14] Amen. It It's your duty.
[1:20:22] Go ahead, preacher. You know, it reminds
[1:20:25] me one time I heard a story of a man or
[1:20:28] person
[1:20:30] that fell that was laying there in, you
[1:20:33] know, on the floor and moaning,
[1:20:35] groaning, and saying, "Well, you know,
[1:20:37] I'm not going to school today. The kids
[1:20:39] don't like me. They all hate me. They're
[1:20:41] all against me. The teachers don't like
[1:20:43] me. They all talk about me. I I ain't
[1:20:46] going. And I'm I'm just depressed by all
[1:20:48] of that." And his mother come over there
[1:20:51] said, "Son, get up and go on to school.
[1:20:54] You know you're the principal.
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:21:01] You're the priest.
[1:21:03] It's your duty."
[1:21:06] Has nothing to do with it. Whether
[1:21:07] everybody likes you or don't like you.
[1:21:10] Well, there's some of them don't like
[1:21:12] me. I tell you, they didn't look my way.
[1:21:14] They I tell you what, I've seen people
[1:21:16] with complex beard in Texas.
[1:21:19] Amen. But I I'll just tell you right
[1:21:22] now, friends, if you'll get yourself off
[1:21:23] your eyes off yourself and get your eyes
[1:21:26] on what you're really called to do.
[1:21:30] Amen. You were called to worship. You
[1:21:32] were called to give praise to his name.
[1:21:34] You are not here to be pleased. You are
[1:21:37] here to give a sacrifice.
[1:21:42] Well, I don't feel like going to church,
[1:21:44] but you're a priest. It's your duty.
[1:21:47] You've got to be there. Well, I don't
[1:21:50] feel like taking a pardon service. You
[1:21:51] know how that is. I'll go,
[1:21:55] but I ain't going to raise my hand.
[1:22:02] You
[1:22:03] know, you know, I I don't I just don't
[1:22:06] feel like taking a part of the service.
[1:22:08] You're a priest. You're making a
[1:22:11] sacrifice, a spiritual sacrifice. Not
[1:22:14] not giving somebody some hand me down as
[1:22:16] they call it today. That's all good to
[1:22:18] have nothing else. And not going to give
[1:22:20] somebody coming to church. That's all
[1:22:22] good. Have nothing else. But it's you
[1:22:25] making the spiritual sacrifice, the
[1:22:28] fruits of your lips, giving praise to
[1:22:30] his name.
[1:22:33] When you see that time that's coming and
[1:22:35] everybody blaspheing and saying things
[1:22:36] and doing wrong, what do you do? walk
[1:22:39] away. You're supposed to stand there a
[1:22:41] spiritual sacrifice saying, "The blood
[1:22:44] of Jesus Christ cleanses me from all sin
[1:22:46] makes me a new creature in Christ."
[1:22:48] Jesus, you crazy fellow. According to
[1:22:51] what you say, it's all right, but to me,
[1:22:52] it's the power of God and the salvation.
[1:22:54] I believe it. You say, "Well, do you
[1:22:56] believe in divine healing?" Oh, I don't
[1:22:58] believe. Better ask our pastor, "What do
[1:23:00] you what do you think about? You're the
[1:23:02] priest now. You're the guy." Say, "Yes,
[1:23:04] sir. I believe it." Yes, because God's
[1:23:07] word said it. So, do you believe in the
[1:23:10] baptism of the Holy Spirit? Yes, sir.
[1:23:13] How do you know it? I've received it.
[1:23:16] That's right. The Holy Spirit that fell
[1:23:17] on the apostles, same Holy Spirit that
[1:23:19] falls now. You remember? You remember in
[1:23:23] the Old Testament when the mana was
[1:23:26] fallen in the wilderness journey and God
[1:23:28] had Moses to put some of it away in the
[1:23:32] holiest of holies so that every
[1:23:34] generation following could have a taste
[1:23:36] of that original mana. And brother
[1:23:39] Brandham tells us what was God saying
[1:23:42] there. The same thing he said to Moses.
[1:23:44] In other words, this Holy Ghost mana
[1:23:47] that began to fall on the day of
[1:23:48] Pentecost was to sustain the church. And
[1:23:51] the church was to live only by the Holy
[1:23:55] Spirit until the day we enter the
[1:23:57] millennium. Hallelujah. The same Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost. Now notice it was for everyone
[1:24:03] that was a priest in the Old Testament.
[1:24:06] Everyone in the New Testament that
[1:24:07] becomes a Christian, born again, becomes
[1:24:10] a priest to God. And we're kings and
[1:24:13] priests. A priest is a make of
[1:24:14] sacrifice. And we are to give God the
[1:24:18] sacrifice of our lips and give praise to
[1:24:21] his name. Say, "I don't feel like it.
[1:24:23] You do it anyhow." That's a sacrifice.
[1:24:26] Hallelujah. Say, "I I feel too tired."
[1:24:29] The devil will tell you that till he
[1:24:32] takes you to hell. That's right. You are
[1:24:35] to make a spiritual sacrifice. The
[1:24:38] fruits of our lips giving praise to his
[1:24:41] name, kings and priests and to God. The
[1:24:44] Bible said we are. He's made us priests
[1:24:47] and kings.
[1:24:49] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh my. You
[1:24:53] know how many times you see the spirit
[1:24:56] falling and some just don't enter in.
[1:25:01] They let some fear, some complex, maybe
[1:25:05] some weariness,
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:09] some something hinder them. Right? You
[1:25:12] know, Brother Brandham talked about this
[1:25:14] a little bit about how the Holy Spirit
[1:25:16] had fallen in the Holy Ghost
[1:25:18] series and he said in question Answers
[1:25:22] on the Holy Ghost, he said the Holy
[1:25:23] Spirit fell in the building last night
[1:25:26] and that was for edification. I was
[1:25:27] standing there trying to tell the people
[1:25:29] that they must receive the Holy Ghost
[1:25:31] and the devil had come around saying,
[1:25:34] "Don't listen. Sit still." And my my
[1:25:39] sister said, "Bill, I was so happy while
[1:25:43] you were preaching. I felt like I could
[1:25:46] just raise up and jump through the
[1:25:48] wall." And I said, "Raise up and jump.
[1:25:50] That's all." That's right. And she said,
[1:25:52] "But when you went to doing that and the
[1:25:55] people began to shout, started shouting,
[1:25:58] then I just felt like I was an old
[1:26:00] nothing." And I said, "That's the devil.
[1:26:05] That's Satan." When he come in to do
[1:26:08] that, I said you should have raised up
[1:26:10] anyhow. We are priests of God making
[1:26:14] spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our
[1:26:17] lips giving praise to his name.
[1:26:21] Hallelujah. Amen. Now so it's important
[1:26:26] that
[1:26:27] everybody enters into an atmosphere of
[1:26:31] praise unto our God. Amen.
[1:26:34] remember when Elisha um had that
[1:26:38] experience of Jehoshaphat and the king
[1:26:40] of Israel came up to see him and Elisha
[1:26:43] got all out of sorts
[1:26:46] and and that when the king of Israel was
[1:26:49] in trouble that's when he turned to
[1:26:50] Jehovah after all the other times he was
[1:26:53] serving idols
[1:26:55] you know and and he he got all
[1:26:57] frustrated mad and angry about it
[1:26:59] because this man had the audacity when
[1:27:01] trouble was in the land Now you're going
[1:27:03] to turn to God.
[1:27:07] And so you
[1:27:09] know the in order to get the spirit to
[1:27:12] come down, he had to say, "Okay,
[1:27:17] bring me a minstrel." Yes, sir. Get to
[1:27:19] playing some of them old songs for a
[1:27:21] minute. Amen. Yes, sir. I, you know, I
[1:27:25] got to get in the spirit here. I done
[1:27:28] got all out of sorts. All right. I
[1:27:30] argued with my wife on the way to church
[1:27:33] that can't say he misbehaved. This
[1:27:36] happened here. And I'll tell you, if he
[1:27:38] preaches as long as he did last time,
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:42] he
[1:27:44] [Applause]
[1:27:47] will, you know, but he got all out of
[1:27:50] sorts when that that when seeing this.
[1:27:54] So he said, "Bring me a minstrel." You
[1:27:57] know, get give them playing. and and
[1:27:58] they got to playing some of those old
[1:28:00] songs and and and brother Brandham said
[1:28:03] he they sang once like there you know
[1:28:05] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[1:28:08] in the sweet sweet by and by and
[1:28:10] different songs like that and he said I
[1:28:12] tell you brother when we get all the
[1:28:14] formal shackles shook down and the
[1:28:17] spirit of God back in the songs again
[1:28:20] and get back to an old place where we
[1:28:22] can have the spirit of God moving in the
[1:28:24] place then the prophet can see a vision
[1:28:27] then the powers of God comes on the
[1:28:29] church, then we can see divine healing.
[1:28:32] Then they'll see the resurrection of
[1:28:33] Christ. Then they'll see he's the same
[1:28:36] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:28:38] That's why we want spiritual soul
[1:28:41] service.
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:43] Well, but brother Brandham said, you
[1:28:45] know, it was one of them old songs,
[1:28:47] Brother Tim, of there's going to be a
[1:28:49] meeting in the air. That wasn't old
[1:28:51] song. That was contemporary for that
[1:28:53] time. Right.
[1:28:57] Wow. Come on.
[1:29:03] Come on. Don't get your nose bent out of
[1:29:05] joint. Amen. Let's worship God. Get your
[1:29:09] ideas down. Remember why you're here.
[1:29:12] What is the real purpose? You can
[1:29:15] criticize this or criticize that. Amen.
[1:29:18] But remember what our focus ought to be
[1:29:21] on is on Jesus Christ, lifting his name
[1:29:24] high, worshiping him, giving praise to
[1:29:28] his name.
[1:29:32] Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:36] You say, "Brother Brandom, I'm not the
[1:29:38] prophet." Well, if you ain't the
[1:29:39] prophet, you can be one of the
[1:29:40] instruments. That's right. Just keep
[1:29:43] playing. That's right. You ain't got no
[1:29:44] more than them 10. Just give vent to
[1:29:46] that just as hard as you can. If you
[1:29:49] can't be the prophet, be a part of the
[1:29:50] minstrel. Do something. Listen to him.
[1:29:53] Do something to bring the spirit of the
[1:29:55] Lord down. Amen. The prophet couldn't do
[1:29:58] it himself. Neither can the preacher.
[1:30:00] Amen. He's got to have the minstrel to
[1:30:03] help him. And when the prophet and the
[1:30:05] people got in harmony with God, then the
[1:30:07] prophet began to see things. Now
[1:30:09] brother, if you don't see divine
[1:30:11] healing, you don't see the baptism of
[1:30:13] the Holy Ghost, you don't see this
[1:30:15] mighty move of the spirit moving in the
[1:30:17] last stage here, just get in the spirit
[1:30:20] one time and you will see things will be
[1:30:24] revealed to you. You'll begin to notice
[1:30:27] things looking different
[1:30:30] than what they used to be. You won't
[1:30:32] come along with the criticizing spirit.
[1:30:36] You'll come back humbly. Amen.
[1:30:41] Amen. Amen. You know, church is to be a
[1:30:45] house, a place of prayer, a praise, of
[1:30:49] worship to God. Isaiah 56 and 7 said,
[1:30:53] "For mine house shall be called an house
[1:30:57] of prayer for all people."
[1:31:00] A place where worship flows up to heaven
[1:31:04] and God's glory comes down. Amen. where
[1:31:08] heaven literally comes down to earth and
[1:31:11] we are lifted up into heavenly places.
[1:31:15] You see, we've got to restore the
[1:31:17] original purpose of of people of praise.
[1:31:21] Not not just a performance or just going
[1:31:24] through the motions. But the house of
[1:31:26] God is not where you come to be
[1:31:28] entertained.
[1:31:30] It's where you come to worship. That's
[1:31:32] right. That's right.
[1:31:36] Ah, there I agree. You know, many songs
[1:31:38] today that are sung by these Christian
[1:31:40] artists, they may have some good lyrics,
[1:31:44] but the spirit they sing them in is
[1:31:46] wrong and sometimes demonic, right?
[1:31:50] And when it's that way, it's mockery.
[1:31:53] It's sacrilegious. It's blasphemies.
[1:31:58] You know, Elvis could sing Amazing Grace
[1:32:00] with his melodious voice. But his spirit
[1:32:03] was wrong.
[1:32:05] Ferland Husky debuted the song On the
[1:32:09] Wings of a Snow White dove at the Grand
[1:32:12] Old
[1:32:13] Opry in 1960. It went up It went up all
[1:32:17] the way into the the high uh into the
[1:32:21] charts and the on the pop charts. It was
[1:32:25] number one for a long time in the
[1:32:27] country and western and it made the top
[1:32:31] of the pop charts as entertainment.
[1:32:34] But when I was there as a little boy,
[1:32:36] come on now. When I sat on the pew not
[1:32:39] too far out looking at brother Brandham
[1:32:41] and I watched him sing that song, he
[1:32:44] sung it with a different anointing.
[1:32:48] And he sung it in the spirit. And when
[1:32:50] he did, it took a new meaning.
[1:32:54] And it became worship.
[1:32:59] It became something that brought the
[1:33:02] spirit of God down.
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:06] An inspiration struck the prophet and he
[1:33:09] even wrote a verse to it.
[1:33:13] Hallelujah. Yes, he did. Amen.
[1:33:17] So, we worship in spirit and in truth.
[1:33:21] So even though sometimes lyrics may be
[1:33:25] scripturally right, it's got to be sung
[1:33:26] in the spirit to be acceptable before
[1:33:28] God. It must bring the atmosphere of the
[1:33:32] Holy Ghost.
[1:33:34] But what do we come to church for?
[1:33:37] We're here to worship.
[1:33:40] And praise is not optional. I I I do it
[1:33:43] if I feel like it or not.
[1:33:46] Or if I want to or not. You see, praise
[1:33:49] gives us access to God.
[1:33:53] You don't realize it, but does. You see,
[1:33:55] in Psalms 100, David gives a a call to
[1:33:58] worship. He says, "Enter into his gates
[1:34:02] with thanksgiving and into his courts
[1:34:04] with praise." So, you see, it's a
[1:34:08] entrance into God's courts.
[1:34:11] The gates of God's dwelling opens with
[1:34:14] thanksgiving. You see the the the
[1:34:17] courts, the inner sanctum um are entered
[1:34:21] by praise. You see, God doesn't just
[1:34:24] allow any spirit into his courts.
[1:34:28] He is enthroned on praise. And praise is
[1:34:32] like a password. You see, to gain
[1:34:35] entrance into God's presence, you just
[1:34:37] don't barge into the throne room of a
[1:34:39] king with complaining lips and a
[1:34:42] depressed attitude. You come with
[1:34:44] reverent joy. That's how you have to
[1:34:47] come. And it's important how you
[1:34:48] approach the king. Amen. Amen. You want
[1:34:52] him to hold out the scepter to you,
[1:34:55] right? Amen. There is a proper proper
[1:34:59] protocol in and Isaiah 60:16 said, "Thou
[1:35:02] shalt call thy walls salvation and thy
[1:35:06] gates praise."
[1:35:10] So heaven's gates are gates of praise.
[1:35:13] And when we praise, it opens heaven's
[1:35:16] gates for us and it allows us into his
[1:35:19] presence and it gives the worshipper
[1:35:22] entrance and it brings heaven down.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:27] In 1 Peter 2 and5, he said, "You also
[1:35:30] are lively stones, and you are built up
[1:35:34] as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood,
[1:35:40] to offer spiritual
[1:35:42] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:35:45] Christ." So, you're not just saved to
[1:35:48] escape hell, right? Or escape the
[1:35:51] tribulation coming. We're saved to
[1:35:53] become a house of praise. Amen.
[1:35:56] Amen. The church isn't made of brick and
[1:35:59] mortar or stuckle or stone. It's you and
[1:36:02] me.
[1:36:03] Me and you and me filled with the spirit
[1:36:05] and release and worship. Worship is our
[1:36:08] priestly duty. We don't wait on a
[1:36:12] feeling.
[1:36:14] Hello.
[1:36:16] We respond to his faithfulness.
[1:36:20] It is our sacrifice. It is our upfr to
[1:36:25] God that we are bringing. So you don't
[1:36:28] have to wait on a certain feeling.
[1:36:33] Amen. Amen. Amen. You worship before the
[1:36:37] feeling ever comes.
[1:36:41] Amen. Now praise is also a weapon.
[1:36:47] Amen. You remember in 2 Chronicles 20
[1:36:49] when Judah went forth to war, the
[1:36:52] praisers went first.
[1:36:54] And the enemies destroyed themselves.
[1:36:58] That's exactly why. Well, you know, when
[1:37:00] the word goes forth, there's a battle
[1:37:02] going on.
[1:37:03] You don't know, you don't realize it,
[1:37:06] but when a minister stands in the
[1:37:07] pullpit, he is fighting spirits. He, the
[1:37:11] word is attacking the enemy. It's
[1:37:14] driving it out. As brother Brandon would
[1:37:16] say sometimes, you just saw his red
[1:37:18] light tail lights going over the hill
[1:37:20] yonder.
[1:37:22] The devil comes to church. You know, he
[1:37:25] pretty faithful. That's right. He's
[1:37:27] there every service. But so is Jesus.
[1:37:31] Amen. Amen. And what we want to do is we
[1:37:34] want to drive him out.
[1:37:37] Drive him out of our thinking, out of
[1:37:39] our lives, out of our behavior. Come on,
[1:37:42] somebody. And when the word goes forth,
[1:37:45] we want to prepare it. Get ready for a
[1:37:48] battle. Amen. The word is going to cut.
[1:37:51] It's going to it's going to destroy the
[1:37:53] enemy. It'll cut off the head of devils.
[1:37:56] It'll bring healing to the sick. It'll
[1:37:58] bring salvation to the lost. It'll bring
[1:38:01] deliverance to God's people.
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:08] Psalms 149 says, "Let the high praises
[1:38:10] of God be in their mouth and a two-edged
[1:38:13] sword in their hand."
[1:38:16] Amen. Praise and a sword goes together.
[1:38:20] Praise and the word goes together. Your
[1:38:23] praise binds kings with chains.
[1:38:26] When the church praises, there are
[1:38:28] strongholds that break and devils start
[1:38:31] fleeing. Come on. Oh yeah. Amen. In 2
[1:38:36] Chronicles the the Bible says chapter 5
[1:38:39] at the dedication of temple that it came
[1:38:42] to pass as the trumpeters and the
[1:38:44] singers were as one. The house was
[1:38:48] filled with a cloud. Even the house of
[1:38:51] the Lord, the glory of the Lord filled
[1:38:54] the house.
[1:38:56] You see when they when they were the
[1:38:59] trumpeters and the singers was as one as
[1:39:03] the people come in unity with one mind
[1:39:07] and you know when it when it comes to
[1:39:10] coming together we should come with the
[1:39:12] idea of let's dedicate this house.
[1:39:16] I come to dedicate this house. Amen. And
[1:39:19] I want it to be a house of worship.
[1:39:21] That's right.
[1:39:22] And if you'll start doing that, then the
[1:39:24] house will get filled with the cloud.
[1:39:27] Even the even the glory of the Lord will
[1:39:30] fill your house.
[1:39:32] When Paul and Silas was in prison, the
[1:39:34] earth shook and chains came off. Why?
[1:39:37] Because praise is a weapon. It shakes
[1:39:40] prisons. It opens doors.
[1:39:44] That's right.
[1:39:46] When we have, you know, worship in one
[1:39:49] mind and one accord, it releases the
[1:39:53] glory of God. It brings down the pillar
[1:39:56] of fire.
[1:40:03] You know, when you have a good service,
[1:40:04] it's because somebody got in one mind
[1:40:07] and one accord,
[1:40:10] right? You didn't come that way. That's
[1:40:13] right. You come this way with your
[1:40:15] business, with school, with this, that,
[1:40:17] and the children and that and work and
[1:40:19] everything. Come on.
[1:40:22] But when you come together here, well,
[1:40:24] you're to lay all of that down.
[1:40:28] For one purpose. Yeah. To worship.
[1:40:33] Amen. And when you come together in one
[1:40:35] mind and one accord, it releases the
[1:40:39] glory of God and it brings down the
[1:40:41] pillar of fire.
[1:40:44] You do believe it's still in the church,
[1:40:46] don't you? Amen. In Acts four, when the
[1:40:49] church was the saints were threatened
[1:40:50] and they didn't, you know, threaten
[1:40:53] that, you know, they they didn't pray
[1:40:55] less and they didn't praise less. Amen.
[1:40:58] They they gave even more praise. Amen.
[1:41:02] And they were filled with the spirit
[1:41:03] until it shook the house.
[1:41:06] So when the enemy comes, Amen. What do
[1:41:08] you do? You just pour out more praise.
[1:41:11] You don't let up.
[1:41:14] Amen. He'll fill the house again. Shake
[1:41:17] it. Amen. I I believe we need some of
[1:41:20] those church shaking services.
[1:41:23] Where sin is shut out. Unbelief is gone.
[1:41:27] Doubts have perished. I believe fled.
[1:41:32] Hallelujah. Amen. Let every service be a
[1:41:35] revival of worship where we're filled
[1:41:37] again with the spirit. Amen. Amen. Like
[1:41:42] brother Wayne said, we're drunk drinking
[1:41:44] buddies. Amen. I I I can't help it. I I
[1:41:47] just have to get me another sip of new
[1:41:49] wine.
[1:41:51] Hallelujah. We ought to come every
[1:41:53] service with our with our neck opened up
[1:41:55] to heaven and say, "Lord, I'm a new
[1:41:57] skin. I'm not coming in an old cracked,
[1:42:00] decrepit, old skin. I'm coming out as a
[1:42:04] new skin, owned by the Holy Ghost. And
[1:42:06] here I am. Pour your spirit out into me.
[1:42:09] Empty out that new wine into my life.
[1:42:12] [Applause]
[1:42:14] Hallelujah. I'll tell you what, when
[1:42:16] when that happened in the upper room and
[1:42:18] some of them began spinning around them
[1:42:20] bottles with new wine in there, it come
[1:42:23] out 120 of them and first thing you know
[1:42:26] it it spilled out and 3,000 were saved.
[1:42:28] And after that it run come by around at
[1:42:31] the man at the house called beautiful
[1:42:33] and at gate called beautiful and here
[1:42:35] here's it spun by him and said silver
[1:42:37] and gold have I done but I got some new
[1:42:39] wine I'll give you. Hallelujah. And he
[1:42:43] got a drink of addict. Up out of there
[1:42:45] he came leaping and praising God. I tell
[1:42:48] you what, praise is contagious.
[1:42:52] So is discouragement.
[1:42:57] That's true.
[1:43:00] Amen.
[1:43:02] So we are to not be here as spectators.
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:08] Nothing can frustrate a preacher more
[1:43:09] than spectators.
[1:43:12] Come on. Now, of course, there's
[1:43:14] imitators and spectators,
[1:43:16] all kinds of other ters.
[1:43:25] But we are to be more than spectators.
[1:43:29] We are to come as priests
[1:43:31] offering up the sacrifice of praise.
[1:43:35] Wait a minute, brother Tim. I thought
[1:43:37] Jesus was our sacrifice.
[1:43:40] We're going to offer
[1:43:42] Jesus. Oh yeah, Jesus is our sacrifice.
[1:43:45] He's our lamb. All that's true. But this
[1:43:48] spiritual sacrifice is not offering up
[1:43:51] Jesus and offering up his surrendered
[1:43:53] life as a lamb. It's your surrendered
[1:43:55] life.
[1:43:57] That he wants you to give as a priest.
[1:44:00] Amen. It's not Jesus we're taking back
[1:44:03] to the cross and laying on the altar.
[1:44:05] It's you that's going to get laid on the
[1:44:07] altar.
[1:44:08] So you're a chosen generation, a a royal
[1:44:12] kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a
[1:44:14] peculiar people that you should show
[1:44:16] forth the praises of him who called you
[1:44:19] out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:44:22] light. Yes, sir. Now, you know, under
[1:44:24] the new covenant, we're not called to
[1:44:27] offer lambs and bulls, right? Yeah. But
[1:44:30] lives, our hearts, our lips, our love,
[1:44:33] our surrender. These are our spiritual
[1:44:37] sacrifices
[1:44:38] and they rise up like incense before the
[1:44:42] throne and they bring great pleasure to
[1:44:44] the heart of God. In Hebrews chapter
[1:44:47] 13:15, it said, "By him, therefore, let
[1:44:50] us offer the sacrifices of praise to God
[1:44:54] continually, that is the fruit of our
[1:44:56] lips, giving thanks to his name." Amen.
[1:44:59] So it's a
[1:45:00] sacrifice because because you know it's
[1:45:05] not it's not offered sometimes it's not
[1:45:08] offered out of emotion but out of
[1:45:11] obedience
[1:45:13] and faith
[1:45:15] when you're hurting
[1:45:17] when you're tired when you're confused
[1:45:21] when you're all broken and you still say
[1:45:25] God you're worthy
[1:45:27] that is sacrifice that is lifted up to
[1:45:30] heaven like a sweet incense.
[1:45:35] Oh, when God breathes that in and he
[1:45:38] smells it, oh, it's a it's a welcoming
[1:45:43] presence.
[1:45:45] So, he says, "Let us offer sacrifice of
[1:45:49] praise to God continue." And it's not
[1:45:51] based on feelings, it's based on truth.
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:45:58] And when you praise in your pain, it
[1:46:02] becomes pure fire before the throne.
[1:46:05] For it's a sweet smell in the incense to
[1:46:08] God as his gold dried in the fire.
[1:46:13] Paul and Silas sang in prison. Yes, sir.
[1:46:16] And chains broke not just for them, but
[1:46:18] everybody else around them.
[1:46:21] Hallelujah. You realize your praise can
[1:46:24] cause somebody else's chains to fall
[1:46:26] off.
[1:46:28] You're a chain breaker.
[1:46:32] You're a devil defeater.
[1:46:34] You're a serpent bruiser.
[1:46:37] You are here to defeat the enemy, to
[1:46:39] defy the the armies of hell, and to
[1:46:43] stand for righteousness in this age.
[1:46:47] Wonderful.
[1:46:49] You see wounded hands lifted in praise
[1:46:52] to God. It touches the heart of God like
[1:46:55] no other sacrifice can. That's right.
[1:47:01] Something about it that is sacred.
[1:47:04] Something heavenly. It's about a praise
[1:47:07] that doesn't rise just from your
[1:47:09] comfort, but it rises from conflict.
[1:47:13] That's right, from suffering.
[1:47:16] There's a worship. That's a worship that
[1:47:18] that heaven just can't ignore. It's a
[1:47:21] It's the worship of the wounded.
[1:47:24] Brother Tim, you're way out there. Well,
[1:47:26] Psalms 151:17 says, "The sacrifices of
[1:47:30] God are a broken spirit and a broken and
[1:47:35] contrite heart, oh God, thou wilt not
[1:47:37] despise."
[1:47:40] Amen. Amen. You see, when wounded hands
[1:47:44] are lifted, hands that have been through
[1:47:47] betrayal, Yeah. been through loss,
[1:47:51] grief, rejection,
[1:47:54] heartbreak, that carries something away.
[1:47:57] It's It's like gold in the presence of
[1:48:00] God in the courts of heaven. Why?
[1:48:04] Because that kind of praise cost
[1:48:07] something.
[1:48:10] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:48:16] You see, Abraham would not take a barrel
[1:48:18] place for Sarah that cost him nothing.
[1:48:23] Jesus would not take a kingdom without a
[1:48:26] cross.
[1:48:28] David bought on's threshing floor and
[1:48:30] refused to offer sacrifices that cost
[1:48:33] him nothing.
[1:48:35] The woman who washed Jesus' feet wanted
[1:48:38] the best most costly alabaster box.
[1:48:42] Hallelujah.
[1:48:44] I want your very best. Yes, sir.
[1:48:49] To give to him. And it came from a
[1:48:52] wounded heart and wounded hands.
[1:48:58] Cuz wounded praise is a costly praise.
[1:49:03] Amen. What do I mean? Well, anybody can
[1:49:07] praise God when the bills are paid,
[1:49:10] when the body's healed,
[1:49:12] when everything's going good, but when
[1:49:15] the storm is raging,
[1:49:18] and you still scream out, "Bless the
[1:49:20] Lord, oh my soul, and all that's within
[1:49:22] me, bless your holy name, that's gold
[1:49:25] tried in the fire." That's a sweet savor
[1:49:28] that's rising up to the from the altar
[1:49:31] of a heart that is still burning even
[1:49:33] when it's bleeding.
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:38] You see, sacrifice, it implies pain.
[1:49:43] It implies surrender.
[1:49:46] It implies something laid down that is
[1:49:50] valuable to the giver.
[1:49:53] So when you praise when you're bleeding,
[1:49:57] when you lift up scarred hands,
[1:50:00] trembling with pain, but still lifted up
[1:50:03] toward heaven,
[1:50:05] that's a sacrifice angels can't offer.
[1:50:08] That's right.
[1:50:10] Come on. Yes, sir. Only they they they
[1:50:14] offer praise of holy, holy, holy. But
[1:50:17] you can offer praise. They can't. That's
[1:50:19] right.
[1:50:20] Only the redeemed. Come on. Only the
[1:50:24] wounded worshipper can give God that
[1:50:26] kind of offering.
[1:50:28] The great high priest himself was a man
[1:50:31] of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[1:50:34] And even in Gethsemane when sweat poured
[1:50:37] out of him like blood, he said, "Not my
[1:50:41] will but thine be done." So even when he
[1:50:45] was wounded, he obeyed. Even when he was
[1:50:47] broken, he prays. Amen. So even right
[1:50:50] now when we when we are wounded, we lift
[1:50:53] our wounds to God and it touches his
[1:50:56] heart because why? It reminds him of his
[1:51:00] work that he did while he was in the
[1:51:02] flesh. And let me just tell you, your
[1:51:05] scars don't disqualify you.
[1:51:09] They identify you.
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:16] They say, "I've been through the fire,
[1:51:19] but I'm still worshiping."
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:22] Yes, sir. I've been through great
[1:51:24] trials, but I'm still giving him praise.
[1:51:28] Hallelujah. That's what it says. Amen.
[1:51:31] And when you lift up broken hands to
[1:51:34] God, it's a declaration before all of
[1:51:38] heaven. It declares it. Your faith is
[1:51:41] not for sale and your worship is not
[1:51:43] conditional and your praise is not
[1:51:45] dependent on your feelings and because
[1:51:48] you are saying thou can he slay me I
[1:51:51] will trust him. That's right.
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:51:56] Amen. Thank you.
[1:51:59] You see it's the voice of the three hub
[1:52:02] children in the fire saying our God is
[1:52:06] able to deliver us. But even if he
[1:52:10] doesn't, we will not bow.
[1:52:13] And that kind of praise is dangerous to
[1:52:16] the enemy.
[1:52:18] Amen. But it's precious to God. That
[1:52:21] kind of praise gets heaven to moving.
[1:52:24] Come on. Amen. Because God dwells in
[1:52:27] that kind of praise. That kind of praise
[1:52:29] reach heaven. You remember brother
[1:52:31] Brandham talking about that? He said,
[1:52:33] "There's some of my children down there
[1:52:35] in trouble." Oh, his angel said, "Well,
[1:52:37] I'll go down. I'll go down. I'm
[1:52:39] wormwood. I'll I'll just wash it off
[1:52:41] with water. I'll put out that fire." No,
[1:52:44] it ain't. This ain't for you, boys.
[1:52:47] Another I'll come with my mighty sword.
[1:52:49] I could slay a million at a time. No,
[1:52:51] it's not for you, angel. Come on. This
[1:52:54] is a mansized job. It's for my for me.
[1:52:59] Amen. Remember him talking about he
[1:53:01] called the thunderhead said, "Come over
[1:53:03] here." got there and the can grabbed the
[1:53:05] lightning bolt and the next thing you
[1:53:07] know he was right there in the very
[1:53:09] fiery furnace. Yes, sir. What brought
[1:53:12] him down? That kind of praise.
[1:53:16] But here's what's so wonderful. Wounded
[1:53:19] hands lifted up become healed hands.
[1:53:28] I remember a young girl in our youth
[1:53:30] came to youth camp. She was a by now a a
[1:53:33] married girl and she had been through
[1:53:36] terrible scars, horrible things in her
[1:53:39] life. Wanted to kill herself, cut
[1:53:41] herself many times. She hated herself,
[1:53:44] cutting her wrist and everything.
[1:53:47] And she finally come to God with all
[1:53:49] kinds of scars on her life.
[1:53:53] She was sitting there at youth
[1:53:55] camp and she was, you know, sitting in
[1:54:00] in the adult section because the young
[1:54:03] people are sitting up front and she
[1:54:06] thought, you know, I'd love to raise my
[1:54:08] hands to God and worship him, but you
[1:54:11] know, if I did, it'd pull my sleeves and
[1:54:15] people see my scars.
[1:54:19] Wow. And she said, "But you know,
[1:54:23] somehow I just love him so much for what
[1:54:27] he's done for me. I'm just going to
[1:54:29] forget about how I feel and just raise
[1:54:32] my hands to him in worship."
[1:54:35] And when she raised her hands and began
[1:54:37] to worship her, the scars disappeared
[1:54:40] off her wrist. Hallelujah.
[1:54:45] Don't run up because scarred hands can
[1:54:49] become healed hands.
[1:54:54] When you offer a sacrifice of praise,
[1:54:59] wounded hands lifted up. Yes, sir.
[1:55:02] Become as healed hands to God.
[1:55:05] Not always because the circumstances
[1:55:08] changes, but because something divine is
[1:55:11] exchanged when you worship. Because
[1:55:14] Isaiah 61 says, "He gives us beauty for
[1:55:18] ashes.
[1:55:19] The oil of joy for mourning." See,
[1:55:22] there's an exchange. The garment of
[1:55:25] praise for the spirit of heaviness.
[1:55:29] So your wounds may still show, but now
[1:55:31] they can carry glory. Amen. That now
[1:55:34] your hands are not just raised, they're
[1:55:36] redeemed.
[1:55:38] Your scars are not just reminders of
[1:55:41] your pain. They're they're testimonies
[1:55:44] of triumph.
[1:55:49] There was a man recently converted in
[1:55:51] our
[1:55:52] church. He never came to an altar. He
[1:55:56] never came down for prayer. He just
[1:55:59] sitting back in the mezzanine back
[1:56:01] there.
[1:56:02] And it was as a prodal he came back the
[1:56:05] Lord and he was all tatted up from head
[1:56:08] to
[1:56:09] toe just all over him. Sin had taken him
[1:56:13] to the dregs of humanity and to drugs
[1:56:16] and alcohol, tobacco. He'd been raised
[1:56:18] in a message family, raised in a message
[1:56:22] church, but he got bitter toward church
[1:56:25] people because of a church
[1:56:28] split and the behavior of Christian
[1:56:32] people who were not showing their
[1:56:34] Christianity.
[1:56:39] And he was wounded, hurt, confused,
[1:56:43] didn't want nothing to do with it.
[1:56:48] But his son had been to church, a young
[1:56:50] boy, and said, "Come, daddy. Something
[1:56:53] has changed me." He said, "Yeah, I've
[1:56:55] seen something's happened to you, boy."
[1:56:57] Said, "Let me go see what that's about.
[1:56:59] Maybe this church is different."
[1:57:04] And
[1:57:05] so, you know,
[1:57:08] I I had a chance to speak to him after
[1:57:12] the service because his young son
[1:57:15] facilitated it and insisted that we get
[1:57:17] together and brought him to me. And he
[1:57:19] said, "I want you to meet meet brother
[1:57:21] Tim. I want you to meet meet him." And
[1:57:24] so, we I shook his hand. I just stood
[1:57:27] there for a minute. I spoke to him. And
[1:57:29] I said, 'You know, you've been hurt.
[1:57:32] You've been
[1:57:34] wounded, but I want to say to you, just
[1:57:37] forget all about that. Come on. And I
[1:57:40] want you to do one thing. Just one
[1:57:42] thing. All you have to do is one
[1:57:44] thing. I want you to go fall in love
[1:57:46] with Jesus.
[1:57:48] That's the best thing right there.
[1:57:50] Because I tell you this, whatever's
[1:57:53] happened to you, whatever Jesus didn't
[1:57:55] do it. That's right. That's right.
[1:57:58] Hallelujah.
[1:58:03] So if I can get you to do one thing,
[1:58:05] just one thing, go fall in love with
[1:58:08] Jesus.
[1:58:12] And there he come the next service was
[1:58:15] sitting in in the back there and and his
[1:58:20] wife and family around him. They went
[1:58:22] home. He was addicted to cigarettes. He
[1:58:25] said, "I couldn't go 20 minutes without
[1:58:28] banging my head against a a wall because
[1:58:31] of crave for cigarettes." He been had
[1:58:34] drugs,
[1:58:35] alcohol, you know, and
[1:58:38] whatever. And he said, "I was sitting
[1:58:42] there. I I I sat there in that meeting
[1:58:45] that day, and I went home, and he text
[1:58:48] me after the service, and he says,
[1:58:50] "Brother Tim, I don't know. Something's
[1:58:52] happened.
[1:58:56] I didn't even realize something was
[1:58:58] really going on. But I got home and my
[1:59:00] wife said to me,
[1:59:03] "Jason, did you know it's been 4 hours
[1:59:06] since we've been home? You hadn't smoked
[1:59:07] a cigarette?"
[1:59:09] What? What? No. I I hadn't even wanted
[1:59:12] one.
[1:59:13] G
[1:59:20] that week his his wife brought him his
[1:59:23] favorite alcohol and opened his bottle
[1:59:25] and wanted him to drink with
[1:59:27] her. He started to take a sip of that
[1:59:31] and went and poured it down the sink. I
[1:59:33] don't even want that no more.
[1:59:36] The drugs, the alcohol, the tobacco, all
[1:59:39] of it was all gone.
[1:59:42] Nobody laid hands on him. Just the power
[1:59:45] of the word and the atmosphere of the
[1:59:48] Holy Ghost. Heaven came down upon him
[1:59:51] and changed that man in God's
[1:59:55] presence. But I want to tell you now,
[1:59:57] those tatted arms that once did service
[2:00:00] to the devil that lifted cigarettes and
[2:00:03] drugs and alcohol, now those same tatted
[2:00:06] hands are lifted up as a testimony with
[2:00:09] praise to our God.
[2:00:11] Hallelujah. Tatted fingers among proud
[2:00:14] and joy. Now turns the pages of God's
[2:00:17] holy Bible.
[2:00:22] So I want to tell you, lift up those
[2:00:24] hands. Hands that you think are unworthy
[2:00:27] hands. Amen. Because it symbolizes world
[2:00:31] reverence and devotion and surrender to
[2:00:33] God. As Paul said, I would that men
[2:00:37] everywhere should pray. Lift it up, holy
[2:00:39] hands without anger or disputing.
[2:00:43] So lift them up when the tears are
[2:00:45] falling. Lift them up in the dark times
[2:00:48] when you're pushing back depression. For
[2:00:51] when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel
[2:00:54] prevailed against your enemies. So I
[2:00:56] want to tell you, lift them up when the
[2:00:58] enemy says there's no reason to worship.
[2:01:01] Amen. Because when those wounded hands
[2:01:04] rise in praise, confessing the promises
[2:01:07] and expressing faith, it moves the heart
[2:01:10] of God. It touches the high priest.
[2:01:14] And he says, "That's the sound I died
[2:01:16] for. I died for that kind of sound." To
[2:01:20] hear my children say, "I was lost, but
[2:01:24] now I'm found."
[2:01:27] That's the kind of worship that shakes
[2:01:29] heavens and brings God down to earth. So
[2:01:32] don't silence your praise.
[2:01:35] Release it. Let it go. Amen. Because no
[2:01:40] other sacrifice touches God like the one
[2:01:44] you give through your pain.
[2:01:48] Revelation 5 and 8 says that there were
[2:01:51] golden vials.
[2:01:54] There were golden vials full of incense,
[2:01:57] which are the prayers of the
[2:01:59] saints. Your prayers lifted in faith and
[2:02:02] love are like incense before God's
[2:02:05] throne. Every groan, every tear, every
[2:02:09] intercession is not lost. Right? It's a
[2:02:12] sacrifice.
[2:02:15] Now, you know, this may not be true. It
[2:02:18] may not be the way it is. Maybe I'm
[2:02:20] venturing without authority, but when I
[2:02:22] look at those these vows full of voters
[2:02:26] and when the seventh seal was open to
[2:02:28] release the coming of the Lord, there
[2:02:30] were prayers that were poured out.
[2:02:33] And I've thought about that many times.
[2:02:35] You know, what would be prayers that
[2:02:38] would be held up?
[2:02:40] Well, you know, I go over into the
[2:02:42] tribulation period and I think, you
[2:02:44] know, there are bowls or vials of
[2:02:46] judgment that are stored up.
[2:02:50] And by the way, I don't know if you know
[2:02:51] it or not, but those seven angels that
[2:02:54] hold seven vials are
[2:02:56] not heavenly angels. They're men.
[2:03:01] Because one of them John tried to
[2:03:04] worship and said, "Don't do it. I'm a
[2:03:08] prophet." Now he was seeing him in a
[2:03:10] vision. And so in the vision he was
[2:03:13] seeing this and he would show him he
[2:03:15] would show him the bride, the lamb's
[2:03:17] wife. He would show him, you know, the
[2:03:19] the the city, you know, the new
[2:03:21] Jerusalem and the measurements of it. He
[2:03:23] show him all this. Yes, sir. He saw all
[2:03:26] of this in a vision and he wanted to
[2:03:28] worship him. He said, "Don't you worship
[2:03:29] me. I'm the prophet." I'm just one of
[2:03:32] your fellow servants.
[2:03:34] But whoever it was, you know, was able
[2:03:36] to show him things, you know, the great
[2:03:38] and and then the the lamb's wife
[2:03:41] and all of these other brought him down
[2:03:43] into revelation like no other could.
[2:03:47] Cuz this was one of man he saw in the
[2:03:49] vision. Are you with me? Amen. But but
[2:03:54] there in the great tribulation
[2:03:57] ahead, you know, there is going to be
[2:03:59] the wrath of the lamb and God's wrath
[2:04:02] will be poured out upon the earth.
[2:04:05] And there are files of judgment. Yes,
[2:04:08] sir. And again, I can only imagine that
[2:04:12] down through the ages, there would be
[2:04:16] fathers watching their wives murdered,
[2:04:20] killed, raped, children murdered,
[2:04:23] killed, hung on
[2:04:27] crosses, skinned like an animal,
[2:04:31] burnt with a fire, bellies cut open. And
[2:04:35] I can imagine as they watch that, as
[2:04:38] they watch that, they breathe out a
[2:04:41] curse to that mother
[2:04:45] Yeah. Judgments.
[2:04:49] But God couldn't answer them,
[2:04:52] right? Because why? There's a word that
[2:04:55] actually protects the horse. She's going
[2:04:57] to be even in the tribulation. We can't
[2:05:00] speak her out of existence now.
[2:05:04] The word That's right. That's right.
[2:05:06] Amen. Because why? There's a word that
[2:05:08] says she's going to be over here in the
[2:05:11] tribulation.
[2:05:13] So, she's going to be there. So, what
[2:05:15] all of those judgments, I can only
[2:05:18] imagine, were stored up, seven ages
[2:05:22] worth of seven jud seven vows of
[2:05:25] judgment.
[2:05:27] Oh. Oh my. And I can only imagine, you
[2:05:30] know, when when that is happening and
[2:05:33] these vows are poured out, guess where
[2:05:36] we are? We're at the marriage supper of
[2:05:39] the lamb.
[2:05:41] Is that right? And I can imagine one of
[2:05:44] those angels, messengers, men, come on,
[2:05:47] getting up from the table and say,
[2:05:49] "Excuse me, we're going to have a little
[2:05:51] entertainment."
[2:05:53] Yeah. And he he steps out with one of
[2:05:56] them vials of judgment.
[2:06:00] And opens up the entrance of heaven and
[2:06:02] pours it out on the earth on the beast
[2:06:03] and the false prophet and upon the
[2:06:06] devil's kingdom. And guess what happens
[2:06:08] in heaven? There are praises and
[2:06:10] shoutings and glory and hallelujah.
[2:06:14] Come on.
[2:06:16] So now when we come to those vials those
[2:06:19] those those that incense those that that
[2:06:22] is there that is a bowls there of a
[2:06:26] golden vial full of incense which are
[2:06:29] the prayers of the saints and I think
[2:06:31] what
[2:06:32] prayers have been held up Lord
[2:06:36] and I think of the prayers that I prayed
[2:06:40] since I was a little
[2:06:42] boy you
[2:06:43] know I started preaching mentioned this
[2:06:46] message when I was
[2:06:48] 15 and I wanted Jesus to come then.
[2:06:52] Yeah. Yeah. But if he had come then some
[2:06:55] of you wouldn't be here. That's right.
[2:06:57] That's right.
[2:07:00] There were more names on the book of
[2:07:02] life that had not been manifested on
[2:07:05] earth and their names had not been
[2:07:07] dipped in blood.
[2:07:12] And maybe tonight I'm waiting on you.
[2:07:17] Hallelujah. Maybe I'm waiting on some of
[2:07:19] you tonight.
[2:07:22] Prayers. What kind of prayers? Come,
[2:07:26] Jesus, come.
[2:07:28] What is the last prayer of the Bible?
[2:07:32] Even John said, "Even so, come Lord
[2:07:35] Jesus."
[2:07:37] And that's got to become the last
[2:07:39] prayer. Amen. The greatest prayer of our
[2:07:43] lives is even so come Jesus come.
[2:07:50] And when the seventh seal was
[2:07:52] open, the vials of those prayers were
[2:07:55] poured out and it issued in the cycle of
[2:08:00] the coming of the Lord
[2:08:02] and began to be where one thing after
[2:08:05] another after another after another
[2:08:08] brings about the end time events until
[2:08:11] we are here now.
[2:08:15] Your prayers offered in faith
[2:08:18] are like incense before the throne.
[2:08:21] Every prayer,
[2:08:24] every groan, every tear, every
[2:08:27] intercession is not lost. It's a
[2:08:30] sacrifice.
[2:08:32] Yeah. Your prayers are not forgotten.
[2:08:36] Psalm 56 says, "Every tear you cried is
[2:08:40] collected in heaven's bottle."
[2:08:43] Not one is lost or shed in vain. That's
[2:08:46] right.
[2:08:47] your priest interceding between life and
[2:08:49] death. Yeah. And your prayer cloth, your
[2:08:53] prayer closet is your altar and every
[2:08:57] cry is a sacrifice.
[2:09:02] And you're to be a living sacrifice.
[2:09:06] So he said, "Present your bodies as a
[2:09:08] living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
[2:09:11] unto God." So we don't lay lambs on the
[2:09:13] altar. lay ourselves, our time, our
[2:09:16] choices, our lifestyle. God doesn't want
[2:09:19] dead offerings. He wants a living
[2:09:22] surrender.
[2:09:23] A living sacrifice means that everything
[2:09:26] I do is for his glory. Amen. And it's
[2:09:30] not just a Sunday offering. This is a
[2:09:33] daily obedience, not a one-time emotion.
[2:09:37] But our thoughts, our choices, our
[2:09:39] bodies, our desires must be placed on
[2:09:41] the altar. Amen. Even holiness is a
[2:09:45] sacrifice. It's a beautiful one. Why
[2:09:48] dress like we do? It's a sacrifice. Why
[2:09:50] do our women don't wear cosmetics and
[2:09:53] look like the world? Because it's a
[2:09:55] sacrifice to him. Because we're looking
[2:09:57] for his approval instead of the world's
[2:10:00] approval,
[2:10:03] doing good, sharing with others. The
[2:10:07] Bible said in Hebrews 13:16, "But to do
[2:10:09] good and to communicate or to share,
[2:10:12] forget not. For with such sacrifices God
[2:10:15] is well pleased."
[2:10:17] So when you give to others, even your
[2:10:20] tithe and your offerings given to the
[2:10:23] Lord is a worship. You do it as a
[2:10:26] priest.
[2:10:27] You know Paul Paul would say, "I'm full.
[2:10:30] Haven't received the things were sent
[2:10:32] from you." They were odor of a sweet
[2:10:34] smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well
[2:10:37] pleasing to God. So he called the given
[2:10:40] of the saints
[2:10:41] worship. Surrender to God's will. That's
[2:10:44] worship. Jesus surrendered his will and
[2:10:47] said not my will
[2:10:50] but thine be done. Cuz every time you
[2:10:54] surrender your will and submit to him,
[2:10:56] it's a holy sacrifice.
[2:11:03] This is where the deepest of sacrifices
[2:11:06] happen. You
[2:11:08] see, we are here in this day, in this
[2:11:11] time, and we are to worship. We are
[2:11:14] called as high priest to God. We're to
[2:11:18] offer spiritual sacrifice.
[2:11:22] We're to give our all. And service is
[2:11:25] more to be than just attendance.
[2:11:30] more than just sitting on the pew.
[2:11:34] But it's giving God your best.
[2:11:37] Amen.
[2:11:38] I'm going to ask you to bow your
[2:11:41] head. Here you are at a time that the
[2:11:44] musicians come,
[2:11:49] please. Here we are. The time is
[2:11:51] marriage age. It's bride age. It's bride
[2:11:54] time. Marriage time. When two are
[2:11:57] gathered
[2:11:58] together and they become joint
[2:12:01] hes, we as overcomers here in this age,
[2:12:05] we're rewarded to sit with him on his
[2:12:07] throne. That means to reign with
[2:12:09] him. We're sons and daughters of God to
[2:12:14] reign. Like the king said to Esther,
[2:12:16] I'll give you I'll give you anything,
[2:12:19] even half of the kingdom. What he was
[2:12:21] saying, as my wife, we are one. You can
[2:12:25] be co-regent with
[2:12:28] me. The bride of Christ is married to
[2:12:31] him and we're to be
[2:12:33] co-regent and hes
[2:12:36] together. The spirit of God gives
[2:12:39] witness that we are children of God.
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:51] Is he worthy of your praise?
[2:12:56] Do you know what brother Brandham told
[2:12:58] us about why Leodysia would be
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:05] rejected? He brought out in the
[2:13:07] Leodysian church age what would
[2:13:10] happen and he used his
[2:13:13] illustration. It'd be Jesus again with
[2:13:16] dirty feet.
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:20] people who not will not worship him, who
[2:13:24] will not give him
[2:13:25] praise, who's so
[2:13:30] afraid of just giving him their
[2:13:34] all. I just want to ask you today, have
[2:13:37] you surrendered your
[2:13:38] all? Have you give everything to him? Is
[2:13:42] there something in your life you have
[2:13:44] held
[2:13:45] back? something you haven't
[2:13:48] given and you want to just say, "God,
[2:13:51] today, I want to really surrender my
[2:13:53] life to
[2:13:55] you. I want to just really do it,
[2:13:59] Lord. I haven't reigned as a king. I've
[2:14:03] let things reign over me. Maybe
[2:14:06] depression, maybe
[2:14:10] discouragement,
[2:14:11] maybe a horrible thing like pornography
[2:14:14] or something else. take rule over your
[2:14:18] life. You're to be a
[2:14:21] king. You're to have
[2:14:24] dominion. It's not to have dominion over
[2:14:27] you. The Bible said sin shall have no
[2:14:31] dominion over
[2:14:36] you. Any time you in your life that you
[2:14:40] make a real surrenderance to God and a
[2:14:44] holy dedication to
[2:14:46] him and your house becomes the dwelling
[2:14:50] place of the Holy
[2:14:53] Ghost where he abides and he's
[2:14:58] welcome. Why don't you let him do
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:01] it? Only he can change
[2:15:04] you. No, you don't have to come to an
[2:15:06] altar. It can happen right in your
[2:15:09] seat. But if you needed to come to an
[2:15:11] altar, I wouldn't let that stop
[2:15:15] me. I'd make that
[2:15:18] confession. Maybe you want to just bring
[2:15:21] those wounded
[2:15:23] hands. Maybe sin has wounded you.
[2:15:26] Unbelief, some doubt, some fear, some
[2:15:30] torment has wounded you.
[2:15:35] No, if you could just realize if you if
[2:15:40] your life will start praising
[2:15:42] him in your attitude, in your behavior,
[2:15:45] in your walk and your
[2:15:47] talk, and your life will be a praise to
[2:15:51] him. It'll bring him honor and bring him
[2:15:54] glory. It'll be a sweet smell and savor
[2:15:56] that when you walk into his presence, he
[2:16:00] holds out the scepter.
[2:16:05] and said, "I'll give you everything in
[2:16:06] my
[2:16:07] kingdom. Ask what you
[2:16:10] will. It'll be given to
[2:16:13] you." Why don't you ask him to do it
[2:16:16] tonight? Why don't you make that full
[2:16:19] surrender? Say, "Brother Tim, I I've
[2:16:21] asked for the Holy Ghost and I didn't
[2:16:22] didn't give it." I'll tell you
[2:16:25] why. Because you didn't make a full
[2:16:28] surrender. You see, he's not going to
[2:16:30] live in your life with that porn habit.
[2:16:34] With that unforgiven
[2:16:36] spirit, with that doubt and unbelief,
[2:16:39] you're going to have to surrender it
[2:16:41] all. He won't live with you in
[2:16:46] with unclean things in your life. Why
[2:16:49] don't you let him just wash you tonight?
[2:16:53] Wash you, make you
[2:16:54] clean. Amen. with it. Your old sinful
[2:16:59] tatted hands can be raised up not in
[2:17:02] shame but in victory where there can be
[2:17:05] a joy in your heart, a love in your
[2:17:09] life, a peace in your
[2:17:11] soul. Why don't you ask him
[2:17:15] tonight? What about you? Would you like
[2:17:17] to just dedicate your building to him
[2:17:21] tonight? Just make a surrender to him.
[2:17:24] Give me the key of F. Key of
[2:17:28] [Music]
[2:17:33] F. Well, I've been
[2:17:35] on the
[2:17:38] mountain with
[2:17:43] Jesus and I've been
[2:17:46] down in
[2:17:48] valleys so low. Have you been there?
[2:17:55] But
[2:17:56] not one time has he failed
[2:18:04] me. For to him with my
[2:18:10] troubles I go. Would you like to just
[2:18:13] walk with
[2:18:15] him? So
[2:18:18] let me walk with him.
[2:18:23] you, Jesus.
[2:18:27] Would you like to start a fresh with
[2:18:28] him?
[2:18:31] Would you like there to be a a praise
[2:18:33] come out of your
[2:18:35] life? It ain't out of have
[2:18:37] to, but it's out of a real surrendered
[2:18:41] heart.
[2:18:43] Without you,
[2:18:46] I could never.
[2:18:52] Oh,
[2:18:54] never make
[2:18:57] heaven my
[2:19:01] [Applause]
[2:19:02] heart. Lord, you found
[2:19:06] me when I was so lonely. God, I've been
[2:19:14] there. And you found He can find you in
[2:19:18] your pew tonight where you are.
[2:19:21] You come right down to
[2:19:23] you. Amen.
[2:19:27] You found
[2:19:30] me when no
[2:19:32] one could love
[2:19:37] me. Oh, no one knew just what you
[2:19:46] do. Just worship him now. Make it your
[2:19:50] prayer. Oh
[2:19:56] let you
[2:20:01] Jesus. Oh don't
[2:20:05] ever leave
[2:20:08] me alone.
[2:20:14] Oh, if
[2:20:16] I
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:20] you could
[2:20:24] [Music]
[2:20:29] never
[2:20:31] make my Maybe you want to stand with me
[2:20:35] now.
[2:20:38] If I had
[2:20:41] all the wealth
[2:20:44] of this whole world. Oh yeah. Oh
[2:20:49] yeah. If I had
[2:20:52] all that
[2:20:55] money could buy.
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:02] and I had
[2:21:04] not the love
[2:21:07] of my
[2:21:13] savior. I would
[2:21:16] rather be dead than
[2:21:21] alive. Sing it with me now.
[2:21:29] Oh,

[2:22:09] to him right now and just say, "Jesus, I
[2:22:12] love you." If it's anything I want to
[2:22:15] do, I just want to fall in love with
[2:22:17] you. wash me tonight. Make me clean in
[2:22:21] your
[2:22:22] presence. Let me feel your presence just

[2:22:30] Lord. Wash me in your presence. Let me
[2:22:34] have the reality of God in my
[2:22:36] life. Glory.

[2:23:46] thee for healing me. I will praise you
[2:23:48] for my life. I will praise you for my
[2:23:51] heart. I will praise you for the
