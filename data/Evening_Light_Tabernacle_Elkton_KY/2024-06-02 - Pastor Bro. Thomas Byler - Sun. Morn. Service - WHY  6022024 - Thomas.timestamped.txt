[46:13] different thought than what I've had and
[46:15] amen just something I feel would be kind
[46:17] of fresh amen from the presence of the
[46:19] Lord amen um I can't think of any other

[47:44] clip mic ready or can you play that clip
[47:48] amen and uh I'd like to play a clip and
[47:52] also have sister Sher give a testimony
[47:54] before we get started this morning um
[47:58] so let's just do while you're getting
[48:00] that ready sister Sher let's have you
[48:01] give your testimony she's got a
[48:03] testimony she'd like to give the for the
[48:05] Lord and and give him a praise and so
[48:07] forth and I don't know just what all she
[48:08] wants to say but come on you want to me
[48:10] to bring you the microphone or did you
[48:13] want to come up here all right here you
[48:16] go the stage is for other
[48:19] people um I think many of you know uh a
[48:24] year ago last May I was um diagnosed
[48:27] with cancer and I still have it but I'm
[48:32] praising God because he's keeping it at
[48:33] Bay that it's not moving at all right
[48:35] now and they're hoping it's going to
[48:37] stay that way
[48:40] um I always start to say things and I
[48:42] forget uh but anyway I'm praising God
[48:44] for that every day but since May a lot
[48:46] of other things have happened Satan has
[48:48] been working on me healthwise and I just
[48:51] keep looking to God every day for every
[48:53] everything that he's done for Satan has
[48:54] done to me I've looked up toward God and
[48:57] ask God to give me the strength to get
[48:59] through it and to help me get through it
[49:00] and I've often also have claimed healing
[49:02] on everything including my cancer I know
[49:06] he will heal my cancer but it be in his
[49:09] timing he has a plan for me and I plan
[49:11] to stay with that plan the reason I
[49:14] bring this up is I know a lot of people
[49:16] struggle with a lot of things it can be
[49:17] work it can be uh you know maybe some a
[49:20] neighbor it could be somebody else it
[49:21] could be another problem you could have
[49:22] an emotional problem or a health problem
[49:24] but I have learned over this past year
[49:26] that the more that Satan throws at me
[49:28] the closer I want to get to God because
[49:30] I know God's going to take care of me uh
[49:32] several months ago about 2 or 3 o'clock
[49:35] in the morning um I had a bunch of words
[49:37] coming through my
[49:39] head uh don't know why except that God
[49:42] put him there and uh I was urged to get
[49:45] up and put him on paper and when I was
[49:47] finished I realized it was a poem I am
[49:49] not a poem poet La it never will be but
[49:52] I'd like to share this with you because
[49:54] this will kind of tell you where I've
[49:55] been what's happened to me and how I've
[49:58] dealt with it and I can share this I've
[50:00] shared this with a couple of other
[50:01] people in the church I have changed it
[50:03] um but I have shared this with the other
[50:05] people in the church and I've also
[50:06] shared it with people that do not go to
[50:08] our church because they need to hear
[50:09] what God can do as well I entitled this
[50:12] the devil doesn't
[50:14] know the devil gave me cancer to turn my
[50:18] eyes away from my heavenly father and
[50:20] worship Him each day but the devil
[50:23] didn't
[50:23] know the devil calls my heart each
[50:26] second to skip a beat he said he'd make
[50:29] it better if I bowed down at his feet
[50:32] but the devil didn't know the devil gave
[50:35] me a kidney stone the pain was so severe
[50:37] he said he'd take the pain away and wipe
[50:39] away my tears but the devil didn't know
[50:43] the devil gave me an aneurysm on my aort
[50:46] to make me scared the devil thought he'd
[50:48] had me and tried to show me he cared but
[50:51] the devil didn't know one more time he
[50:54] caused a leak in my aorta though it is
[50:56] small he said he could fix all this if
[50:58] i' and I'd be free from it all but the
[51:01] devil didn't know what the devil didn't
[51:04] know was the trials he threw at me made
[51:07] my fi faith in God stronger and he
[51:09] should leave me be my God is bigger and
[51:12] better than the devil could ever be my
[51:14] life is in the hands of God and He will
[51:16] always be with me my God is my physician
[51:19] in times he will heal me you see I have
[51:22] an awesome God who loves and cares for
[51:24] me and I think we all know that our God
[51:26] is more awesome than anybody in the
[51:28] world could be and I want to thank all
[51:30] of you for your prayers I still need
[51:31] them because I can feel them but he's
[51:33] given me a piece through this whole
[51:35] situation every diagnosis that was
[51:37] thrown at me I just felt like okay God
[51:40] here here we go again I just need your
[51:41] help and I need to strength my strength
[51:43] needs to depend on you and that's where
[51:45] it does but the prayers help as well so
[51:47] thank you all for your prayers
[51:55] amen
[52:25] e
[52:55] e for
[53:26] like
[53:59] um hold on uh I just want to say a few
[54:01] words you know
[54:03] whenever brother Tommy posted this on
[54:06] our men's prayer group amen and I
[54:09] watched it I think it's all appropriate
[54:11] but you know we like to watch what's
[54:14] happening in the world ain't that right
[54:16] just as we would watch Israel or watch
[54:19] things that are going on and I believe
[54:21] it was in the souls in prison now if you
[54:23] remember brother brandham said that the
[54:25] Baptist met Methodist and all those
[54:27] people were coming after the oil he says
[54:30] could it be that this is the time that
[54:31] they the foolish virgin is coming after
[54:34] the oil he says because he makes a
[54:37] statement he says because the Bible says
[54:39] that they when they do come they don't
[54:40] get it isin that right amen and I
[54:44] thought that many years ago the prophet
[54:46] thought maybe that because of all the
[54:47] ones that were coming in and uh you know
[54:50] from the different denominations and so
[54:52] forth that perhaps that was the foolish
[54:53] virgin going after the oil and you know
[54:57] uh but you know just in my way of
[54:58] thinking you know perhaps that was not
[55:00] so much the the foolish version going
[55:02] after because we've went through a lot
[55:04] of time but perhaps that was a time of
[55:06] actually people coming out of those
[55:08] denominational systems and coming to
[55:10] Christ is't that right but he did make
[55:12] the statement that when that foolish
[55:14] Virgin Goes after that oil amen it's uh
[55:17] it's real close to time isn't it amen
[55:20] because God comes when he come when they
[55:22] begin to go after that oil the Lord
[55:24] comes and he takes his bride away is't
[55:26] that right so I don't know I don't know
[55:29] what this is this could not be might not
[55:31] even be the foolish virgin because of
[55:33] how far out this is okay because of how
[55:36] uh into the world into Sodom like that
[55:39] it is this could be merily this could
[55:43] merily be the sodomites knocking at the
[55:45] door or trying to find the door because
[55:48] if you remember brother Brandon preached
[55:50] he says you know whenever and he was
[55:51] talking about Billy Graham preaching to
[55:53] the Pentecostals and preaching to all of
[55:55] that c C group that Billy Graham
[55:57] preached to amen and he would have altar
[56:00] calls and the people would constantly
[56:02] thousands would come to the altar right
[56:05] and and and brother Billy would say you
[56:07] know I come home I have thousands of
[56:09] converts when I come back next year I
[56:11] may have two thousands and I don't have
[56:14] 20 and you know and brother Brandon was
[56:16] was trying to correct him and talking
[56:18] about he says you know he says he
[56:20] doesn't leave far enough you know and
[56:22] they were he said that what they were
[56:24] doing what it was actually doing it was
[56:26] actually blinding them because they are
[56:29] wearying themselves to find door cuz
[56:32] remember the sodomites they were come to
[56:34] lot's door and they were trying to get
[56:36] into his house but they were struck with
[56:38] blindness and they couldn't find the
[56:40] door ain't that right so just year
[56:42] repentance or just here coming to the
[56:44] Lord amen and just come coming to the
[56:46] altar how many knows that you got to go
[56:48] further than that amen God has to come
[56:50] and give you that baptism of the Holy
[56:53] Ghost isn't that right when Paul had a
[56:55] convert he come back next year he had
[56:57] great great great grandchildren amen and
[57:00] brother bam talking about you know they
[57:01] woried themselves to find the door and
[57:03] perhaps this might be even the the group
[57:06] that is in that category I'm not here
[57:08] I'm not a prophet I can't tell you
[57:09] exactly what it is but I want to play it
[57:11] just to kind of get up to date and watch
[57:14] a little bit of what's going on in the
[57:16] world Amen because how many knows one
[57:18] wants to know what's going on watching
[57:19] the signs of the time ain't that right
[57:23] so we'll let brother uh Mike if you
[57:24] would just play that clip up till a
[57:27] little after the 700 Club if you'll
[57:29] notice let me just say a few couple more
[57:32] things so that you'll take note whenever
[57:33] you're watching it if you'll notice this
[57:36] group is under the uh banner and under
[57:39] the influence of of Christian rock music
[57:43] okay and it's all about the lights it's
[57:46] all about the big screens it's all about
[57:48] that and and about the music and uh uh
[57:52] so just look at that and there's
[57:54] something else that I want to point out
[57:56] the other point is is that they're
[57:58] saying that all of the churches are
[57:59] participating in this even the 700 clug
[58:02] and those who would perhap considered
[58:04] more conservative even they're
[58:06] participating in it all right so you
[58:10] know that what you participate in you
[58:11] tie yourself too amen and so if you're
[58:14] part of that well that could be a scary
[58:16] thing amen but uh you know if you'll see
[58:19] it you'll realize that these people have
[58:21] no dress code nothing or whatever or no
[58:23] fruit for repentance at all just she you
[58:26] know uh you know for the most part it
[58:28] looks like just a new thrill or whatever
[58:30] it might amen but I would hope and trust
[58:33] that out of it at least you know
[58:36] somebody some good is done ain't that
[58:38] right but I just want to play this
[58:40] before we get into the message this
[58:42] morning amen and let you amen see this
[58:45] for just a minute so just take note and
[58:47] realize the lateness of the hour God
[58:49] bless you Amen brother Mike if you would
[58:51] play that in California churches across
[58:54] the Golden State recently came together
[58:57] to host the nation's largest ever
[58:58] baptism as CBN Charlene Aaron reports an
[59:01] estimated 12,000 people took the plunge
[59:04] it's part of a nationwide summer of
[59:06] Spiritual
[59:07] Awakening we declare at this speech that
[59:09] Jesus Christ is Lord thousands made
[59:12] history by joining the baptized
[59:14] California movement at beaches and
[59:17] churches across the
[59:20] state day one was a mighty move of God
[59:23] read a post on the group's Facebook page
[59:25] another post addit today was powerful
[59:28] more than 6,000 entered the Pacific at
[59:31] Huntington Beach with the additional
[59:33] 6,000 people immersed in churches across
[59:36] the Golden State Pastor Mark Francy the
[59:38] Visionary behind the Monumental event
[59:41] spoke of even Satanist joining in it was
[59:44] a special weekend we did see a lot of
[59:47] people so many cool stories there's
[59:49] they're flooding in from Satanist that
[59:52] you know came to the beach that got
[59:53] radically encountered by the love of God
[59:55] and end up getting baptized
[59:57] spontaneously to one young couple you
[1:00:00] know um one couple literally proposing
[1:00:03] the guy gets baptized comes out of the
[1:00:05] water has a ring in his pocket proposes
[1:00:07] to his wife on the beach Francy helped
[1:00:09] entire families who made their way to
[1:00:12] the water I baptized one family that
[1:00:14] probably had 17 people between kids
[1:00:17] nieces nephews Aunts Uncles everyone
[1:00:20] getting baptized crying hugging I mean
[1:00:23] it felt like a book of Acts um page
[1:00:27] churches from various denominational
[1:00:29] backgrounds also played a role it's not
[1:00:32] about one denomination it's an it's an
[1:00:35] uh inter denominational effort it's a
[1:00:37] really a Great Commission mandate that's
[1:00:40] that's allowing everybody enough room in
[1:00:43] our Doctrine to go look we might not see
[1:00:45] eye to eye on every single tenant of our
[1:00:47] faith but we all do agree that Jesus
[1:00:50] told us to go into all the world Make
[1:00:51] Disciples of all Nations baptizing them
[1:00:53] the baptisms come on the heels of a move
[1:00:56] of God happening in other parts of the
[1:00:58] country as Florida beaches the Texas
[1:01:01] gulf and rivers in the midwest have
[1:01:03] become epicenters for Mass baptisms now
[1:01:07] with the success of baptized California
[1:01:09] Francy is already raising the bar for
[1:01:12] 2025 with an event called baptize
[1:01:15] America so we'll have two expressions
[1:01:17] we'll have Sunday morning on Pentecost
[1:01:19] Sunday June 8th that all the local
[1:01:22] churches will open up their their their
[1:01:23] facilities right after your last service
[1:01:26] of the morning time that everyone
[1:01:27] baptizes in local churches and then that
[1:01:29] evening we'll do Regional events All
[1:01:31] Over America but we already have I mean
[1:01:33] we have some denominations some
[1:01:35] non-denominational networks with
[1:01:37] thousands of churches saying we want to
[1:01:39] plug this in and encourage everybody in
[1:01:41] our movement to be a part of this
[1:01:43] Charlene Aon CBN
[1:01:46] News exciting to see thanks Charlene
[1:01:48] Gordon back to you it is exciting to see
[1:01:52] and and and it's so scriptural when the
[1:01:54] enemy comes in like a FL God always
[1:01:56] raises up a standard I'll give you a
[1:01:59] lesson I I learned about two weeks
[1:02:02] ago amen we won't let that play out I
[1:02:04] just want it to go long enough to let
[1:02:06] you see that even those people are
[1:02:08] involved and condoning it and are all
[1:02:10] for that amen so how many knows that
[1:02:14] that to me that really Point towards the

[1:07:31] after all these about 14 years to come
[1:07:34] back into this church and to find that
[1:07:37] glorious Spirit moving among the
[1:07:42] people amen if you'll go back that if
[1:07:45] you ever want to see that 1960 and and
[1:07:48] 0401 in the morning amen and you can get

[1:07:54] there and he talked about how he could
[1:07:56] look at the sisters faces how they were
[1:07:58] clean and everybody had a glow on their
[1:08:00] face and everybody was basically the way
[1:08:03] that you're supposed to be and and in
[1:08:05] order and no makeup and and the
[1:08:08] sweetness of the Holy Spirit was there
[1:08:11] cuz how many know that's a real treasure

[1:08:45] God in a church is
[1:08:49] scarce woo think about it today you know
[1:08:53] what I had to think as you know because
[1:08:55] we know that the devil's ambition is
[1:08:57] always to grieve the holy spirit

[1:31:54] now let me get started let me get
[1:31:56] started on my thought first I want to
[1:31:58] take you to where my mind started off at
[1:32:02] way I begin to think about this and I
[1:32:04] thought about why I was thinking of why
[1:32:08] and I know what the prophet said about
[1:32:09] why and what he taught but I want to go
[1:32:12] a a a little different
[1:32:13] direction and that is I thought about
[1:32:16] the
[1:32:18] question on the song Amazing Grace how
[1:32:21] sweet the sound that saved the richet
[1:32:23] like me ain't that right when we've been
[1:32:26] there when I've been there
[1:32:28] 10,000
[1:32:30] years
[1:32:32] huh bright shining as the sun we've no
[1:32:35] less days to sing God's praise than when
[1:32:37] we first begun and I ask myself the
[1:32:40] question after 10,000 years you ask me
[1:32:45] why are you still praising
[1:32:49] God huh why are you still praising God
[1:32:55] god well how many wants the
[1:32:58] answer because his grace is so
[1:33:07] amazing some people can't barely worship
[1:33:10] Him from one Sunday to the
[1:33:13] other they can't drive their sorry
[1:33:17] eyeses to church when church is
[1:33:22] open I don't know about you brother Troy
[1:33:24] but I'm looking forward to all of you
[1:33:27] I'm looking forward to hanging with you
[1:33:29] when we get over there and if I'm going
[1:33:32] to hang with you brother Daniel over
[1:33:33] there I'm gonna hang with you over here
[1:33:36] we're going to have Fellowship over here
[1:33:39] amen if we're going to worship God and
[1:33:41] for 10,000 years not have any less days
[1:33:44] to what sing God's
[1:33:47] praise cuz God is worthy of Our Praise
[1:33:51] he's worthy of more praise more more
[1:33:54] shouting more amens than what we have
[1:33:56] ever given
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:34:02] him that's why I'll still be worshiping
[1:34:06] him because I didn't let it get still I
[1:34:09] didn't let it get
[1:34:11] old never let this message never let the
[1:34:15] word become common to you
[1:34:31] like he told that church always keep it
[1:34:35] alive stay
[1:34:46] alive I'll just speak it as he comes
[1:34:49] would that be all right you ask me about
[1:34:52] a Bor after two weeks
[1:34:55] I thought maybe you'd have a hard time
[1:34:59] preaching I thought maybe you'd be
[1:35:02] little
[1:35:06] backslid why
[1:35:10] not I'm glad you asked
[1:35:15] me
[1:35:17] because the next
[1:35:19] scripture brother
[1:35:21] Carson I believe it's found in
[1:35:27] Isaiah 26
[1:35:30] and3 because thou will keep him in
[1:35:35] perfect
[1:35:37] peace whose
[1:35:39] mind is stayed on thee because he trusts
[1:35:45] in
[1:35:46] thee folks I tell you right now the more
[1:35:49] you think about your bills the more you
[1:35:50] think about your cares amen that don't
[1:35:52] do a bit of spiritual good for
[1:35:56] you and I'm learning folks I'm here to
[1:35:59] learn now I'm going to teach
[1:36:01] you again and I feel that this is
[1:36:05] something that the holy spirit is
[1:36:06] speaking to us this morning and
[1:36:09] something that's going to have to happen
[1:36:11] in each one of our Lives if we expect to
[1:36:14] go into
[1:36:18] Rapture all
[1:36:20] right because we all know
[1:36:23] that it is Satan's business to get you
[1:36:26] so
[1:36:28] busy that you don't have time for the
[1:36:30] things that are really
[1:36:34] important he'll get you so busy he'll
[1:36:37] get your mind so occupied until you have
[1:36:39] to think about everything else but him
[1:36:43] and I'm a minister Brad the Brad knows
[1:36:45] we know that we can get so wrapped up in
[1:36:47] things brother Brian knows as a Sunday
[1:36:49] school teacher sometimes we got to sit
[1:36:51] down and just begin to meditate say God
[1:36:53] where did I leave you at where did I
[1:36:54] leave off at now I'm going to begin to
[1:36:56] think about you because I've been
[1:36:58] thinking about my job I've begin think
[1:36:59] the work that I've got it
[1:37:01] on are you with
[1:37:05] me and we get away from God because our
[1:37:07] mind isn't stayed on
[1:37:17] God how many times in the Old Testament
[1:37:21] God told Israel to tie it on your bed
[1:37:23] post put it in front of your door think
[1:37:25] about it when you go to bed think about
[1:37:26] it when you get up think about it in the
[1:37:28] middle of the day he told Joshua he says
[1:37:31] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:37:33] out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[1:37:35] therein day and night that's why you
[1:37:38] won't be backslid that's why you be a
[1:37:40] powerful Christian because what you put
[1:37:42] in here amen is what's going to come
[1:37:44] back out and we don't put enough in
[1:37:51] here amen
[1:37:53] a

[1:38:16] them up there over my head throw them up

[1:38:30] saido you better be
[1:38:33] careful you ain't 30 quite
[1:38:36] anymore

[1:38:42] right had to slow down take it easy me

[1:38:48] and took it easy yesterday cuz I said
[1:38:50] you know tomorrow I knew what I wanted
[1:38:52] to preach study a little bit the
[1:38:53] afternoon we just rest just take a day
[1:38:56] of rest we truly did do a no it's Sunday
[1:38:58] it's the Sabbath what am I thinking
[1:38:59] about r no Saturday's the Sabbath my
[1:39:03] mind ain't working right yeah really

[1:39:09] rest amen by God's grace this morning no
[1:39:12] more pain praise the
[1:39:15] Lord praise the
[1:39:17] Lord but as I was
[1:39:20] saying so busy
[1:39:23] how many's
[1:39:24] busy so
[1:39:26] busy with the cares of life with the
[1:39:30] things of the
[1:39:31] world but I'm
[1:39:33] learning I hope you're learning if you
[1:39:36] don't get nothing else I don't care if
[1:39:39] you're sinner I don't care where you are
[1:39:41] if you'll turn your eyes on Jesus the
[1:39:44] things of this Earth will grow dim
[1:39:47] they'll grow less important to you
[1:39:51] church will become more important to you
[1:39:56] worship will become more important to
[1:39:58] you like my son was telling me last
[1:39:59] night he says you know the closer I get
[1:40:01] to God the more addicted I get to God
[1:40:04] the church to love the church to
[1:40:07] worship I thought that's
[1:40:12] right makes proud of Father proud when
[1:40:15] his children speak like that that's my
[1:40:18] son close to the Lord amen tell me all
[1:40:22] it takes to to grieve the Holy Ghost one
[1:40:24] Netflix movie it's all it
[1:40:28] takes just a little bit of the wrong it
[1:40:30] don't take much
[1:40:31] folks that's right God cares about
[1:40:34] everything you do he cares about
[1:40:37] everything you
[1:40:38] think amen and do no matter we have to
[1:40:40] work we've got to do our jobs but I've
[1:40:43] learned God help you God help me that
[1:40:45] even though we have to do that keep
[1:40:47] Christ on the Forefront of your mind see
[1:40:50] keep him thinking about him cuz when he
[1:40:52] thinks when you think oh brother B says
[1:40:55] when those three disciples coming from
[1:40:57] him they talked about him and when they
[1:41:00] talked about him it drew him near I'm
[1:41:02] here to tell you this morning if you'll
[1:41:05] meditate on him he'll come to
[1:41:08] you but we don't have meditation like
[1:41:18] should that's the word he used but Thou
[1:41:21] shalt meditate
[1:41:24] think about it
[1:41:26] think think about him think about all of
[1:41:30] his wonderful
[1:41:31] acts think about his
[1:41:33] goodness think about him and he'll take
[1:41:37] you like he does me to a simple thought
[1:41:40] of when we've been there 10,000 years
[1:41:44] why are we still worship Him we've got
[1:41:46] every
[1:41:49] reason oh my to still worship him and
[1:41:54] praise
[1:41:56] him for the most precious thing that
[1:41:59] there is that's
[1:42:02] amazing
[1:42:03] grace How Sweet the
[1:42:14] Sound 70 years what do we got here 80
[1:42:22] years I don't know how much time we got
[1:42:24] left brother Urban and sister Martha we
[1:42:26] don't know how much time we got left but
[1:42:29] one thing's for sure not a whole
[1:42:32] lot not a whole
[1:42:34] lot the life that we have in the late
[1:42:37] these 80s probably won't be the greatest
[1:42:38] time of our
[1:42:41] life huh aches and pains and lack of
[1:42:46] energy lack of
[1:42:48] strength
[1:42:50] amen but to think
[1:42:54] try to think how long 10,000 years
[1:42:58] is 10,000
[1:43:01] years
[1:43:04] amen that's a long
[1:43:10] time then brother Brad
[1:43:19] sometimes 12:30
[1:43:21] yet 12:30 yet yet it's about time he'll
[1:43:24] close huh sometimes an hour and a half
[1:43:28] seems long to
[1:43:29] us huh
[1:43:32] folks I don't know about you but I think
[1:43:35] we I need to I'm more sensitive probably
[1:43:37] to that time clock than y'all are I am
[1:43:39] not picking on you I've gotten in a
[1:43:42] routine a
[1:43:46] habit certain time comes as a matter of
[1:43:49] fact 15 minutes I'm should be done
[1:43:53] should I quit that's
[1:43:58] it believe I will
[1:44:00] Caleb will why cuz we're going to do it
[1:44:04] throughout the ages to come we're going
[1:44:06] to praise him we're going to Magnify Him
[1:44:09] we're going to glorify him for his grace
[1:44:12] can I talk to you about his grace for a
[1:44:14] minute what do you mean his
[1:44:16] grace well first of
[1:44:19] all it was his grace that brought me
[1:44:22] here
[1:44:27] think about
[1:44:31] it there could have been a
[1:44:35] million in the conception of your birth
[1:44:38] it could have been a million
[1:44:42] others you know you wouldn't have been
[1:44:44] here but now chose you he chose you to
[1:44:49] be here
[1:44:54] Glory I don't know not everybody's glad
[1:44:57] to be here brother
[1:44:58] Glenn not everybody's glad to be here
[1:45:02] can I say something if you don't have a
[1:45:04] second birth it had been better for you
[1:45:07] not to been
[1:45:09] here better for you not to been
[1:45:12] born but God chose you one out of a
[1:45:20] million I don't know about you but
[1:45:22] that's worthy of a holler for me that's
[1:45:25] right he picked you to be
[1:45:28] here he picked you to draw a breath he
[1:45:31] picked you to have a
[1:45:34] spirit thank you Lord that's
[1:45:39] amazing
[1:45:41] W now how many would like to quad triple
[1:45:45] let's quad triple that and quad triple
[1:45:48] isn't enough Brother Brad I don't know
[1:45:50] what kind of ible it would be

[2:16:16] the house of God to have a good
[2:16:18] [Applause]
[2:16:19] time we come to the house of God to
[2:16:21] praise we come to the house of God to
[2:16:23] scream and holler and do whatever you
[2:16:25] feel like
[2:16:30] doing last question I don't know how
[2:16:32] many times I said that brother Rad but
[2:16:35] last
[2:16:42] question why are you so quiet
[2:16:52] you see that was the question brother
[2:16:55] Glenn the question was why are you so
[2:17:00] quiet brother B why are you so
[2:17:06] quiet why can't you sit on your rocking
[2:17:09] chair on your porch or out on your barn
[2:17:13] just sit there
[2:17:26] let me give you the answer the reason
[2:17:29] you can be so quiet you don't have to
[2:17:31] have a lot of
[2:17:34] noise can somebody give me the
[2:17:41] answer
[2:17:42] well maybe I could give you a
[2:17:47] hint a small stream thin stream Rippling
[2:17:51] stream makes all kinds
[2:17:53] of right Rippling a narrow a shallow
[2:17:58] stream ripples a lot makes a lot of
[2:18:03] noise now let me warn you don't just
[2:18:06] take one quote and run with it
[2:18:10] because
[2:18:12] there's a not so deep stream might make
[2:18:16] a lot of
[2:18:17] noise but brother brandom also said
[2:18:21] wherever Jesus is there
[2:18:23] is a lot of noise so don't just go one
[2:18:26] way or the other but now the answer
[2:18:29] is at home we used to have to go grind
[2:18:34] brother Woody our corn and wheat put it
[2:18:38] on a wagon and go down there and have it
[2:18:40] mixed ground up you know but if you go
[2:18:44] with a box wagon oh y'all know where I'm
[2:18:46] going now is that right amen and when we
[2:18:49] go over them bump
[2:18:52] them up but when that was loaded it
[2:18:54] would just squeak a little amen it was
[2:18:58] quiet notot
[2:19:01] quieter so why are you so
[2:19:04] quiet because I'm
[2:19:09] loaded are you
[2:19:11] loaded Are You full Are you full of the
[2:19:14] Holy
[2:19:15] Ghost so then guess what whether you sit
[2:19:18] there and you're quiet or whether you
[2:19:20] scream and holler as long as you're full
[2:19:24] how many wants to be that way amen Lord
[2:19:27] help us to be
[2:19:28] [Applause]
[2:19:33] full full of good stuff how many wants
[2:19:37] to be full of good stuff all right we're
[2:19:39] going to close God bless you this
[2:19:41] morning amen when I begin to think about
[2:19:46] why are you still praising God after
[2:19:49] 10,000 years
[2:19:51] I begin to think of all the reasons how
[2:19:53] many believes we have a lot of reasons
[2:19:56] that way we've been there a million of
[2:19:59] years so my warning to you is don't let
[2:20:03] God don't let the message become common
[2:20:06] to you the answer to this is the easiest
[2:20:10] way for you to let it become common is
[2:20:13] to get your mind off of it to get it
[2:20:15] away from it just a little bit between
[2:20:17] Wednesday and Sunday get away from it
[2:20:19] amen by Saturday you're like wow I've
[2:20:21] gotten away from God don't do that keep
[2:20:24] your mind on God keep focused on God
[2:20:28] it's the worst hello and I've learned by
[2:20:33] God's grace I hope that you can learn
[2:20:35] from my lesson amen that that if you
[2:20:38] begin to think about your work it
[2:20:39] doesn't have to be sin it can be simply
[2:20:42] the cares of life so busy like that
[2:20:45] Methodist woman so busy that she got a
[2:20:48] bunch of stuff on her that she didn't
[2:20:49] need to have
[2:20:52] amen amen let's
[2:20:59] stand I want to tell you this morning
[2:21:01] that what we have here as the prophet of
[2:21:05] God said is very
[2:21:08] precious when you've got a church that
[2:21:11] is alive you've got something that's
[2:21:14] very
[2:21:16] precious now what I want to say is when
[2:21:20] you've got families dads that are alive
[2:21:24] you've got something precious when
[2:21:26] you've got families that are alive in
[2:21:29] Christ you've got something precious not
[2:21:31] just about the church because that's
[2:21:33] what the church uh what makes the
[2:21:36] churches families let's all make sure
[2:21:39] that we are very
[2:21:41] alive and I hope that we that this will
[2:21:44] be such a blessing and it'll change your
[2:21:46] life that whatever percent
[2:21:50] whatever you're giving to God multiply
[2:21:52] it
[2:21:53] amen think about him when you're driving
[2:21:56] down that road and when you every minute
[2:21:58] did you get extra that you ain't got to
[2:21:59] think about your job or whatever say
[2:22:01] Lord here I am I'm doing this business
[2:22:03] but God is more important that I do this
[2:22:05] business deal and reflect you than it is
[2:22:07] for me to Big make a big profit or
[2:22:09] whatever isin that right always keep
[2:22:11] Christ in the Forefront that's what our
[2:22:12] Bible taught us that's the message that
[2:22:14] Spirit spoke to us this morning I
[2:22:16] believe I hope we can take that and go
[2:22:18] home and be different because the time
[2:22:20] draws nigh
[2:22:22] amen bow our heads Lord
[2:22:24] Jesus as we bow our heads
[2:22:27] now I wonder how many this morning would
[2:22:29] raise their hands and say I am I don't
[2:22:32] think like I should I don't think on him
[2:22:33] as much as I should and from this day
[2:22:36] forward I want to pledge myself that
[2:22:38] I'll keep my mind stayed on him God
[2:22:41] bless you God bless those hands my hand
[2:22:43] is up Lord Jesus every one of our hands
[2:22:45] no doubt should be up but we ask you to
[2:22:47] bless those hands that have been raised
[2:22:49] Lord and help us God that you would be
[2:22:54] so much more real to each and every one
[2:22:56] of us Lord that you truly would come and
[2:23:00] make your Abode and do special things I
[2:23:02] know that you will that whenever people
[2:23:04] meditate upon you Lord you'll come your
[2:23:07] presence will come down in their hearts
[2:23:09] and their lives and change them forever
[2:23:11] Lord we ask God that you'll bless each
[2:23:14] one with a closer walk with you now in
[2:23:16] Jesus name we ask it amen and
[2:23:22] amen praise the Lord turn your bibles if
[2:23:25] you will we'll go into the communion
[2:23:31] part always in honor to take the Lord's
[2:23:34] Supper isn't it because this is what he
[2:23:36] asked us to do commanded us to do in
[2:23:40] remembrance of him because if it wasn't
[2:23:43] for this here and what he has done how
[2:23:45] many knows we wouldn't be here amen
[2:23:48] doing what we're doing and having the
[2:23:51] freedom in our hearts and the joy in our
[2:23:52] hearts
