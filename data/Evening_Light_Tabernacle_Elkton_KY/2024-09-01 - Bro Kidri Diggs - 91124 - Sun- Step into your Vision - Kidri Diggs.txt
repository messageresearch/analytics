unto you lord lord receive our worship by letting the fire of God come down upon us in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Genesis chapter 24 and then from there we're going to go to I think I want Romans chapter 4 Genesis chapter 24 let's start reading that um let's start at verse seven and ab and the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his angels before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shal be clear from this oath only bring not my son there again and the servant put his hand upon the of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter and the servant took 10 camels and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia unto the city of Norah and he made his camels to kneel down without the seity by The Well of water at the time of the evening even the time that the woman go to draw water let's go to Romans chapter 4 Romans chapter 4 verse 17 as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before them whom he believe even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were amen may the Lord a bless reading of his word you can have your seat this morning and praise God today by the help of the Lord I hope you're expecting to hear from God Amen by God's grace today I want to use for a subject step into your vision step into your vision amen now we know uh based upon what we believe and what we follow 90% of the prophet's Ministry he walked by Vision amen you know a lot of times God had already showed him things and all he had to do was learn how to let God let everything fall in place amen and you know as as I look in the scripture right here I kind of want to deal with this story between Abraham and elizer and we know that Abraham was the father of Faith amen and that God gave him a promise God promised him that your seed will be like the stars it'll be like the sand you know Abraham your seed is going to be great but in that moment you know when God gave Abraham that promise Abraham was childless Hallelujah you know and he per se you know in his own way of thinking he couldn't see that coming to pass you know why because he was thinking as a mortal Man With God all things are possible it don't matter what it look like it don't matter what the doctor say it don't matter how much money you got in the bank if it's God's will it will come to pass and you know uh uh Abraham you know God gave him that thought God gave him that promise and what I want you to realize is Abraham didn't ask God for any children Hallelujah he didn't ask God for this God made this promise Hallelujah God gave this to him unconditionally amen so I want you to understand that there are Promises of God that God gives unto us that we didn't even ask for Hallelujah so it's not up to us to make these things come to pass but all we have to do is believe in God hallelujah it's not youh uh and your own marriage or your Own Strength no it's just us believing in God hallelujah you know I like what he told the prophet he said if you could just get the people to believe Hallelujah if you could just get the people to believe nothing will be able to stand before you nothing not even cancer amen now I'm a witness to that amen that not even cancer be able to stand in front of the believer Hallelujah cuz you know um um at a very young age in my life and I'm sure some of you heard the testimony but I just want to reflect for a second if you don't mind you know at a very young age in my life by 15 years old I had cancer in my brain Hallelujah and you know God is so good because those of you who don't know me you would have never known that if I wouldn't have told you hallelujah hallelujah so that just shows how great God is and and when he does something he does it completely amen and you know doctors told me you know uh I I'm not going to go through the whole testimony but you know doctors told me I'd be a vegetable they told me you know I I'd be this I I lose this and I lose that and all these things you know in the natural realm but my mom had a vision hallelujah amen and per se I'm not necessarily saying seeing a vision but believing in what God can do and her vision was Hallelujah if we can receive this by faith Hallelujah my son can be made whole amen all I got to do is get him to believe like I believe Hallelujah Glory Church her job was not to do it herself but to get me to come on board with what she belied and if I could come on board B with what she believed Hallelujah I could get my healing Glory because she was already believing that by his stripes I'm already healed see she was stepping into the vision of my life Hallelujah and you may not you may you you you may not understand that right now what's taking place right now in this church on this Sunday morning is a vision of God that was seen Hallelujah on the back side of his mind see everyone in this room God already pre-ordained to be here hallelujah though those who are listening by by by streaming or whatever it is God already saw you sitting down watching it Hallelujah so Church even right now we're living by Vision but you know uh my mom she came to me and she told me in that hospital room son you don't have to accept this you don't have to accept this see she's speaking into my life and you know what at that moment I didn't know what a prophet was I didn't I didn't understand who Jesus Christ is or who Jesus Christ was or who Jesus Christ will be Hallelujah but all she's trying to do is pull me on board hallelujah what she's trying to get me to do to see those things that are not as though they are see church that's given to Abraham's seed no matter what it looks like amen if you could just if you could just believe in God if you could just say my God hallelujah is unstoppable my God hallelujah is is nothing with him is impossible amen my God can do all things if you would just come aboard with me and walk into the vision your prayers can be answered right here in the service oh my I feel the holy ghost moving amen but I but I but need some help from you this morning Hallelujah Church there's something that God has given us that that that'll make us draw God closer and it's very simple four little words this word right here will bring God on the scene this word right here will answer prayer this word right here will heal your body amen this word means so be it God hallelujah I agree with the word amen and if I could just get you to come along with me we'll experience some Supernatural things this morning hallelujah how often do we hear the word and we agree but we never tell God I agree Hallelujah let your confession Hallelujah be a word let your confession amen turn into from just a nod to to spoken word Authority ain't no power in nodding but there's power when we speak amen and this little word right here gave Harry right her children Prophet just sitting there preaching and everybody sitting around him listening and Har right said you know what that ain't nothing but the truth you know what she was saying do you know what she was saying she was saying somebody tell me what she was saying somebody tell me what she was saying she was saying amen and you know what she wasn't even there Hallelujah she wasn't even there when the when when the prophet got the Silver Tip she wasn't even there Hallelujah when he spoke to the storm she wasn't even there when he was in the boat with the with the white brothers Hallelujah she was even there when he got the Caribou but there was something in her spirit that could say Amen there was something in the spirit that could say Amen so be it to my God my God is able Hallelujah is there anything in your spirit that can agree with the word of God hallelujah this is our power amen our power is when we become one with the word and you can't just get there by being intellectual no you have to make a step you have to step into the vision amen but you know Hallelujah her job she felt like was just to express Jesus Christ to me and get me to accept what she believed Hallelujah and mind you I didn't grow up in a message home but God made it that way Hallelujah and you know when my mom got she came into the message and and rededicated her life and different things cuz she grew up Pentecostal but she accept this word and it was by this word hallelujah she was going to meet one of the greatest challenges in her life Hallelujah watching her son come through cancer in his brain but you know she had to live by Vision she couldn't live in the moment Hallelujah she had to believe for those things Hallelujah that her eyes couldn't see in his present moment she had to believe in those things that her heart was yearning to see God do amen and you and I today we have to believe in the Unseen things Hallelujah not the things that may be per se right in our eyes and you know Church anyway to make the story short you know uh she begin to tell me that God's A Healer Divine healer and before the foundation of the world we got Isaiah 53 W God is still a Healer amen he can heal you your diabetes this morning I stand here as a witness I'm trying not to go into too many testimonies Hallelujah cuz God has been good to me Hallelujah I fought some hard battles but God has been good to me and you know what now I look at the battles I've gone through as God making me who I am I look at my battles as God hallelujah producing and forming character amen that's why the prophet would come and say character is not a gift it's a victory amen when you go through things and your feet are still planted on the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's a victory amen because there are some people will go through what you go through and go back in the world but God put something in you to stand your ground Hallelujah to let the devil fight and you fight back amen GL but you know uh when came to she the doctors came in and they started to tell me about chemotherapy now keep in mind I did have a surgery they operated and they took the the cancer that was in my brain out if if I was to kneel down right here I had 27 staplers in my head when they did the surgery but once they did the surgery they told me the cancer is spreading in your body and I'm like whatever what does that mean Hallelujah 15 years old I I I don't I don't understand the diagnosis so they come and they start telling me you know uh the cast is spreading and different things are going to happen and uh uh you must take chemo and radiation treatment so I'm like okay so they begin to explain to me chemo and radiation how many know that this message already explained it Hallelujah the prophet of God hallelujah in different messages he has a message called what is cancer Hallelujah and he begins to break it down see if we would study our message we'd know how to fight the devil H if we' read our Bible we'd know how to fight the devil amen amen Church what are you saying brother de I'm saying we have the formula Hallelujah we have the answer to everything the devil can throw at us if we will just take time to sit with God hallelujah and say Lord show me what to do next H but Church they begin to explain to me and I I don't want to be Lan by the grace of God but maybe somebody needs this and you know Church uhuh they begin to tell me uh the doctor say well the r the chemo he said what it'll do you know they gave me some different things of of the side effects of taking chemo and this is the crazy part why are the things that supposed to be good for you can still hurt you so bad see and that's what the devil does with pleasure that's what the devil deals with living in the world you can live in the world and enjoy it and have a good time but eventually it's going to hurt you real bad eventually there going to be some side effects that you wasn't ready for just trying to find that joy and that peace in the world you'll come up against some side effects that you Wen ready for you might get in a relationship that'll destroy your life for years that you wern't ready for in that moment hallelujah oh my so it's very important amen when we making steps Hallelujah that our footsteps are ordered by the Lord and even going through trials your footsteps are being ordered by the Lord w Hallelujah it took me a while to get there church but I've learned that even God's judgments are righteous even when I'm chastised by God it's for my good hallelujah oh my how many of you young people are or the family of God in general when you were young God a spanking and you was like thank you Mom that was for my good how many of you ever got was about to get a spanking and daddy said come on over here and get you say yes Daddy give it to me real good anybody no we don't look at chest Tim as being a blessing but it is when it comes to spiritual things amen so by the grace of God the Lord amen uh uh well not the Lord the doctors came in and they begin to say well I want you to understand this one thing the Kemo is going to do is going to stunt your growth and y'all can see right now I'm not that tall I'm about 5'9 bless God hallelujah wanted to be about 62 that was my dream be tall fast strong God say no 5'9 and in that moment I'm trying to make sure I don't go too long in that moment church I was probably about 55 so can you imagine doctors coming to me and telling me this medicine that's going to help you is going to stunt your growth I'm like man I'm already pre and you somebody's going to stump my growth so I'm like I'm listening I'm like I don't know about that now he tells me another symptom he says hey you you know what it also going to do is going to uhh make you sick I'm like make me sick I like I thought it supposed to make me better it's going to make me sick I was like man this is something then he gives me another diagnosis of a symptom he says hey you might not if you take this you might not never be able to have children I'm 15 I wanted a family I wanted kids all these things you know I'm thinking in the future by Vision you know I'm looking he said if I take this it might mess up my sale count where I can't ever have children I'm like Kemo you ain't looking too good and then church they told me Hallelujah one of the most crucial things at that age it's going to make your hair come out Brothers you remember when it started coming out you look in the mirror you like what's happening what's happening to me oh my God I'm losing it honey what do you think ah honey just cut it all off Hallelujah see right here is where they put a shunt in my head and I showed you where they got the stap now imagine at that age they telling me you going to go ball and you might be ball permanent I'm like oh man this ain't looking good and at that time I had waves of 360 going around look like a ocean hu looking at me looking at my head you might get a little Drizzy oh look at all those waves Hallelujah but now they're telling me all that church side effects the side effects of me being made whole was I might get sick I might lose my hair I might stunt my growth and I may never be able to have children and then they they say well we'll let you think about it and we're going to come back and then my mom steps in and she say son you don't have to accept Us hall hallelujah I'm telling somebody this morning you don't have to accept what the devil is trying to dish out to you you don't have to accept those symptoms Hallelujah you don't have to accept your child in the world you don't have to accept poverty you don't have to accept sickness Hallelujah cuz we have a god who's already made a way he just wants us to step into the vision step into the vision the revelation of who God is W she said Son you don't have to accept this God has already healed You by his stripes you've already healed did she open in the Bible and tuck me to Isaiah 53 and she started reading to me she said see by your stripes you're already healed all you have to do is accept it I didn't have to shout I didn't have to scream I didn't have to run around in the hospital room all it had to do was say all I had to do was agree with the word word all I had to do was agree with the word and the next step belonged to God once I agreed once I agreed that God Is A Healer once I agreed that before the foundation of the world I made whole once I agreed that I believe the next step belongs to God it's not my job to heal me it's not my job to save me it's not my job to get Deliverance for myself that's God's job when I accept him as deliverer when I accept him as healer when I accept him as Savior Fe is in God's hands you're in God's hands Hallelujah all you got to do is accept it by faith so what was happening I was stepping into the vision of my life I was stepping into my healing Hallelujah before the do could see it I had to accept that it was already done W boy this is good to me and I already gone through it hallelujah oh my can you imagine being sick in your body you in church and you're hearing somebody who's going through sickness and have come out on the other side hold I don't know about you but that make me want to shout yeah that made me want to say I serve that same God I serve that same God and if he did that for him he has to do it for me Hallelujah if God healed his body God has to heal my body he's not a respectable person Hallelujah he has to remain the same he has to remain the same Hallelujah you know church when mom say son God has already healed you buy your stripes buy your stripes you're healed so you know what I did I looked at the situation not too deep but I got doctors over here saying you're going to be a vegetable you're gonna die you gonna do all this stuff I'm G get to that part but I got daughters over here talking about chemotherapy and all the side effects chemo and radi ration treatment cuz the radiation gets in your body and it burns out uh uh aggressive cells you know and again the prophet talked about that Hallelujah and you know church I got chemo on this side radiation on this side and I got the word from a mother a loving caring mother Hallelujah who's been with me from birth who's nourish me who's giving me food put clothes on my back who only wanted the best for me now I got her words versus some men I'm just not meeting who am I going to trust young people who are you going to trust Hallelujah that person over here who's loving and caring and gave you birth and food and clothes are there in your sad moments of there to lift you up who there always there always there always there are you going to listen to the devil somebody who just want to kill steal and destroy you or you want to look at that person who can step into your future and say you will be a daughter of God you will be a Son of [Applause] God who are you going to listen to which Vision will you step into this morning will you step into the vision of Faith or the vision of unbelief so church I'll be honest people think healing is always some Supernatural Cloud coming in and pill of fire in the [Laughter] room come to me father rest on me bunch of nonsense now if that happened to you praise God hallelujah and I hope you levitating this morning Hallelujah but listen church people think Hallelujah Supernatural moments look Supernatural to the eye but Supernatural moments a lot of times deal with the inward person deals with where your heart is it deals with the connection of Faith Hallelujah It won't always be seen outwardly but it'll be something that takes place on the inside it'll be a weakness from the inside Hallelujah and you know Church in that moment I got these two Hallelujah I got what the doctor say vers what my mama say and it was real real simple I said now this lady love me I don't know these guys so I'm going to take the word from her Hallelujah and I said M I believe you I said but this is the thing if God Is A Healer God prove it to me just accept it by faith Hallelujah and that's all I could do was just accept it by faith if I'm Healed God prove it to me cuz I'm going to step out Hallelujah and believe in Isaiah 53 and from that moment Hallelujah those those uh 18 weeks I was in the hospital everywhere I went I would tell people I'm Healed walking around with my head wrapped up I'm Healed they got all these different testimonies about this young boy on the ninth floor who's Crazy got cancer saying he's healed if he was healed why is he in the hospital as a testimony I'm Healed Hallelujah so I went through that hospital I'm Healed nurses come in I'm Healed doctors come in I'm Healed Believers will come to see me I'm Healed Hallelujah Church a lot of things that happen in this message are not for the old days they're for our time for John Ryan it was his eyes for kadre Diggs it was his brain Hallelujah thank the Lord for healing me hallelujah thank the Lord for healing me I challenge you to rise up in the rim of vision right now and confess your healing right now if it happened for John Ryan if it happened for Kadri it can happen for you right now Hallelujah whether whether it be type one or type two diabetes I stand here as a witness God can do it I'm trying to get to the start Hallelujah but make a long story short I know I didn't say that about four times Church they started leaving books and tapes in my room about how to deal with cancer but in that moment I was living by Vision so I wasn't living by having cancer I was living by what God Said that I'm already healed so my confession was I don't have cancer so if you don't have cancer and this is how God gave it to me if I don't have cancer why am I going to read about it why am I going to study about cancer why am I going to read about the effects of cancer if I don't got got it hallelujah hallelujah if you don't got it don't give your ear or your time to entertain it the Bible says cast down imagination Hallelujah cast down every thought every spirit that will exalt itself above the knowledge of God now let me ask you what's your knowledge concerning God hallelujah it should be that my God is able and anything else that comes in your life that says God is not able I challenge you to cast it down Hallelujah we serve a living God see one thing about me brother B when I come to church and it's my duty hallelujah it's my turn or is my lot to minister I expect the supernatural right Hallelujah I'm not an insurance salesman Hallelujah no this is not an insurance meeting h no

know we hear that song and we be like I hate that song I got some of you didn't cuz you thought it was like oh my I love it brother I love that the te eaches on but I hate that song you know why because it wants me to imagine what's really a reality to me Hallelujah if you're living by Vision Hallelujah we don't have to imagine Hallelujah if you're living by Vision you don't have to imagine it's really going to happen hallelujah we're going to be and even so right now we're surrounded by his Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah we step into his presence hallelujah we're surrounded by the glory of God we don't have to wait till our bodies are changed we can experience that part of God right now we don't have to imagine it can be a reality right now surrounded by his glory what will it be it can be a reality right now Hallelujah it can be it can be a reality right now Hallelujah we don't have to imagine and they talk we imagine when we touch his hand and suring my glory what it going to be no church I believe that every son and daughter of God when you wake up in the morning you're in his presence W [Applause] Hallelujah God Is Watching Over Us but Church oh my let me finish this testimony I tell my mom Mom God Is A Healer I want God to prove it to me she said okay son she said but this what we going to do this is why you need spiritual people in your life young people there are places that your parents have already been that they know you're coming to so all they're trying to do is prepare you for the journey it ain't that they trying to stop your fund no they've already come through those challenges so they're trying to help you overcome Hallelujah and you know she says to me she says son and I and I hope y'all ain't offended I'm not a pull pit preacher I'm a walker Hallelujah not a pastor I'm an evangelist I'm a walker Hallelujah you know how this work you pull I preach Hallelujah you pull I preach H if you pull it'll get so intense to God will start talking to you the very things that's on your heart God will start talking to you Hallelujah but you got to pull if you pull I preach amen but you know what else if you quit pulling I stop it's just that simple that's how my gift works you quit pulling I stop I ain't one of those people who got 15 pages of notes that I got to hit before we get done oh let me get this SCH oh let me get the script I'm almost there Saints no you quit pulling it's over W and I know right now some of you are a little timid cuz you've never seen a preacher that's free before Hallelujah you've never seen a wild radical believer well there's a first time for everything Hallelujah and one thing I want to make clear what you're looking at is not somebody who comes out of Pentecostal denomination no not somebody who's come out of Methodist Church what I am is a direct product of the message of the hour Hallelujah and the message of the hour it didn't come to bind us with a bunch of quotes but it came to set us free amen free to worship free to praise free to enjoy God hallelujah that's why we lose our young people cuz they don't feel the joy in service they look at Mom and Daddy and Mom and Daddy like two robots and some of you sitting by Mom and Daddy you've become baby robots preaching 45 minutes hard and some of y'all ain't said amen yet you gave me a smile though I received a smile amen if that's where you at but you know what I want to see you in an environment where you free Hallelujah not this religious bondage Hallelujah where people looking at you and this is just the way I am brother digs liar cuz I guarantee you if I was giving out a million dollars to everybody here you wouldn't sit there like you'll be anxious you'll be on your seat when is it my turn and when I get close to you your hand might start itching cuz you're ready to receive it give me my portion brother digs why not now while the word of God is being preach Hallelujah where is our expectation Hallelujah where what are you expecting from God In This Moment right now Hallelujah see I got a reason why I'm like this cuz I didn't escape death so many times Hallelujah that was the first start of it cancer but look what time is it okay got you all right look my mom say son this is what we're going to do doctors leave out the room mom said son this what we're going to do she said now if you take the cancer if you take the chemo treatment she said I ain't going nowhere I'm going to be right here by your side she said and if you don't take it I ain't going nowhere I'm going to be right here by your side Hallelujah she says this is the deal she said cuz whatever happens whether you take it or don't take it you going to have to live with it she said but whatever decision is made I'm going to always be mom I'm going to always be right here going through it with you she said so whatever you decide hallah and God showed me years ago be I mean years after because I didn't understand spiritual things God was showing me right there in that moment between me and my mom what she allowed to happen was my faith be activated because what was happening Hallelujah Mark 11 and 23 was becoming a reality right there whatsoever you say hallelujah When you pray or you believe you'll have what you ask for Hallelujah so what she did she said Son whatever you say hallelujah that's what we going to stand on if you take it we going to stand on it if you don't take it we going to stand on it but the decision is according to your faith W Hallelujah and I said you know what I said you know what Ma I said Ma I ain't taking it she said all right well the Bible says hallelujah if two or three of us would touch and agree concerning anything we'll have what we ask for church this word the operation of this word it doesn't have an age limit if you could just tap in it don't work like it always works 15 10 Josiah was 8 years old it'll always work so in that moment Hallelujah I said I ain't taking it mama said okay let's pray she had to pray cuz I ain't had the Holy Ghost Hallelujah parents don't let the devil fool you Hallelujah that you standing over your child because they don't have the Holy Ghost and he'll tell you it ain't working because they doing this and they ain't doing keep standing keep praying keep believing Hallelujah I believe there's a place in the token where the Prophet says you act as their Holy Ghost Hallelujah and you know Church in that moment she says okay let's pray we pray then the doctors come back in and they said so what do you decide I said I'm not going to take it boy y should seen demons come out of them you're not going to take it you're going to die you're going to be a vegetable you're not going to have a good life this cancer is spreading to your body and on and on and on and on everything negative and you know what they didn't let up until they start seeing tears come out of my eyes you know why because I didn't have a nature change and I knew I wasn't ready to die I knew I wasn't ready Hallelujah to meet my reward so I'm crying and tears are coming out my eyes and the doctor he says okay okay son okay son so you know uh are you going to take it or not are you going to take it no if you got to cry your tears you cry your tears but you still stand firm on the word of God hallelujah if you got to feel a little pain you feel your pain Hallelujah but you still stand firm on the word of God if you got to be forsaken you be forsaken but you still stand firm on the word of God because now God has to do his part Hallelujah Church doctor said this is not a game we can make a decision without you we could go out the room and make a decision with your mom my mom was like y'all ain't heard what he said is what he say he said he ain't going to take it so he ain't going to take it you know what the doctors did Church you got the power for the kind of results you want in God listen as you can see I'm [Music] Healed Hallelujah without chemo without radiation Hallelujah without another surgery all I had was Isaiah 53 Hallelujah and if it did it for me back then Isaiah 53 can still do it right now right now in elter Kentucky God is still a Healer church and that testimony has bought me through diagnosis of diabetes diagnosis of of of so many other different things and he's still the same Hallelujah but you have to live by vision and God allowed me to step into the vision of my mom Hallelujah who had a healing Hallelujah a belief of healing for her son Hallelujah and here I am as the results of it Hallelujah in church look the prophet of God said he said what is a vision he said a vision let's let's just read something right quick he says a spiritual dream is interpreted rightly interpreted is the same as a vision and what is a vision a vision is the forast of the future events it foretells the things before it happens and that's the way God always vindicates whether it was true or not Hallelujah so I stand here as truth I stand here that Isaiah 53 is real Hall I stand here hallelujah I stand here that when God said he's a Healer is true I stand here when God said he's deliverer is true I stand here when God said he's a savior is true Hallelujah church and I can go on and on and on Hallelujah I stand here when God say he's a provider is true church in 2009 God pushed me to go be a full-time evangelist and I've been doing that since 2009 Hallelujah without the connections of a job or a part-time fulltime you know what I mean and God has just been making a way yeah it gets tough sometimes but God said he's a provider Hallelujah and I got needs right now but what I can do I can look back on what God has already provided and I can say God if you did it back then you can do it right now let's live by Vision speak your [Applause] future I'm believe I'm believe now see I like I like to step way out there when it look like I shouldn't be doing this I said way out there it's a house I want to buy it cost about 300,000 something like that something like that and at this moment I ain't got a dime Hallelujah but I got a God I got a God who the scripture says he owned the cattle in a thousand hills Hallelujah but you know what else keeps me going Hallelujah we believe we're Abraham's seed right I got scripture that says hallelujah Abraham's seed will stay in houses they didn't build I'm stepping into a vision Church somebody's building my house right now they don't even know something might arise and they say well we don't want to stay in Columbia no more let's move to Florida we got to put this house up for sale or better yet let's find somebody to give it to goad I know some of y'all thinking oh man would god really yes he would he promise to give you the desires of your heart if you delight yourself in him Hallelujah I'm not talking about you miserable Christians a Sunday let's go to church so brother B don't call me and ask me where I was no I ain't talking about you miserable people I'm talking about you people who love God love God and a called according to his purpose Hallelujah it don't matter what the gas prices turn out we still going to come to church gas can go up God forbid the 8 we still going to be here why cuz we love God some of you thinking ah Brother D that my car $8 woo that you already you already figuring it out what are you doing Hallelujah in a doubtful real you're stepping into the future if you can doubt that you won't be able to provide why can't you believe that you will be able to provide [Applause] Hallelujah church let me get to this and I'mma close reason why I read this story Abraham said God you promised me a child a seed that was going to be like the stars and the only person I got in my life is this Ela my servant then God comes and tell him he said no ELA is not going to be the one he said look what I want you to do is tell Ela to go find Isaac a bride so he tells elar hey go back to our Kindred and go find my son or wife he said but make sure she believe what we believe Hallelujah make sure she got the same standards we got now eler go back and read it church for the sake of time I'm just going to quote it eler goes out and he says man this is a hard task he says this is a lot to be called to do he said but I don't know how to choose a bride for my Master's uh uh son he said so this is what I'mma do he said Lord he went into prayer Hallelujah church if you're in a spot in your life and you don't know what to do take it to the Lord in prayer Hallelujah but don't go in prayer doubting go into prayer believing you know what a doubtful prayer sounds like I'm going give you a doubtful prayer oh Lord father the devil is fighting so bad oh Lord father father the devil is he's doing so many things in our lives and oh lord the devil he's mess up our finances and God you're able but the Devil he's he's done this and lord the devil and lord the devil and oh lord the devil and oh the devil the devil you talk about the devil more than you talk about God In Prayer you think God is hearing that you exalt the enemy in your prayer that's a doubtful prayer you giving more credit to the enemy than you is God so you know what I do in my prayer hallelu sometimes the prophet of God say you start with worship h i don't just go asking sometimes I get in there I put them in put them in place Hallelujah put them where you at I start How Great Is Our God sing with me how great is Our God and all will see how great How Great Is Our God and you know sometimes it it just don't be clicking you know what I mean you get down in prayer you got so much on your mind then you got to press in a little bit deeper a little bit deeper and then you have to you're the name above all names see you're putting them on that pedestal Hallelujah now let me ask you something if if you put God on a pedestal you think he'll be able to resist that was kind of weak now Hallelujah some of you ain't got no confidence in your prayer life hallelujah amen if you put God on a pedestal you say Lord You're great Lord you're mighty You're My All In All you're my peace you're my banner you're my shield you're my warrior Hallelujah you're my today you're my tomorrow you're my future Hallelujah H you're my substance you're my bread you're my water you're the reason why I live You're My Breath You think if you exalt God like that he'll be able to resist you'll have to show up Hallelujah and church you think about it you get to that spot where you prayer prayer and you you did like like like Ela did he said Lord he said I'm not able to choose a bride he he said but let the woman that comes out to get water when she gets water she gives me something to drink but not only me but all my camels by this I'll know she's the one but the significance of it is Rebecca had to be a woman that could fulfill a vision Hallelujah she wasn't just a person carrying in a water poot she was a person sensitive enough for her lot in the future Hallelujah in church there are things about our lives that we may walk into good or bad but God want us to get to a place where we'll be able to tap into the things that he's ordained for us and walk in it in faith with no doubt Hallelujah and here comes Rebecca Hallelujah just the Bible says as soon as he was done speaking Rebecca came out there Hallelujah she came out there with that water pot and he says can you give me something to drink he gives us something to drink he she gives him something to drink and then automatically Hallelujah she starts to fulfill the prayer Hallelujah she gets the water now I want you to understand something this man had 10 camels that was no easy task Hallelujah you know one camel can drink up to 20 gallons of water so this was a woman who was faithful Hallelujah her character showed that she was faithful amen she didn't stop in the midst of the vision and say that's too much one camel is good enough no she went from that one to the next one that one to the ne now let me ask you is your faithfulness are you Faithful enough to fulfill the vision for your life Hallelujah and look church 20 10 camels is over 200 gallons of water to show you how powerful that is sisters when was the last time you went to Walmart and bought 200 gallons of milk now listen that statement almost seems ridiculous is Right Hallelujah but that was her lot that was she was fulfilling as she stepped into the vision Hallelujah it couldn't be 10 gallons it had to be over 200 Hallelujah she had to be built in such a way to be able to fulfill the desires of who Abraham Hallelujah she wasn't fulfilling the desires of eler no the choosing of a bride came from who Abraham God the father amen he just sent out elizer who is a type of a prophet amen hallelujah Abraham a type of God the Father Ela a type of William brandom Isaac a type of Jesus Christ you and I Rebecca who the type of the Bride Hallelujah brother degs what do you saying I'm saying church if we're here studying this message listen to this message we have the ability to fulfill the thoughts the vision of eler which is our who William brandom Hallelujah we have the ability to fulfill what we read in this message cuz we're living by Vision amen and we believe it by faith amen Church a forecast a vision is a forecast you know all week long we've been talking about the weather last week it was 10 and something degrees can I get amen and we've been looking at the forecast looking at the forecast why what are you doing you're preparing yourself for the forecast you say oh tomorrow it's going to rain so what do you do you prep you prepare yourself for the rain that's coming tomorrow so before the rain even gets here you're preparing for your future brother what are you saying I'm saying that Hallelujah spiritually each and every one of you have the ability to prepare yourself for the journey to come Hallelujah because God has given us a Bible he's given us a message which you can't separate the two they're one hallelujah hallelujah to show us what the future will be and the world doesn't realize it but right now we understand we're looking at the future he said just like it was in the days of lot so shall it be are we in the days of lot homosexuality lesbianism is running wild we're here in the days of lot they got more rights than some of us got Hallelujah he says just like it was in Noah's day he said they got married they gave him marriage they buildt houses they planted they did all these things do we see it Church we're right here living out the future he said so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed so if we can see lot's day if we can see Noah's day shouldn't we also be able to reflect that God himself is being revealed to his bride to his wife God himself is making himself known God himself is becoming visible God himself is having relations with his wife God himself is allowing himself to be touched Hallelujah if we can see Noah's day if we can see Hallelujah lot's day shouldn't we also be able to see our day we're right here in our day we're right here in our time Hallelujah and church but what God what but what the enemy wants us to do is get relaxed and become good church people good cold formal powerless church people that's what he want but if you step into the vision H and believe those things that are not as though they are then you're walking according to Abraham's seed Hallelujah when we look at the world and all the things that's taking place in this world and will say hey this world is not my home I don't belong here I'm here but I don't belong here I'm looking for another city Hallelujah I'm looking for another place Hallelujah and as I close by the grace of God let's go back to Heaven Come on musicians church can you imagine all of us in heaven come through latter the sea the worst age it is hallelujah well all the all the evil that all the other Generations talked about is become a reality in our day H all the wickedness is become a reality in our day we can see it Hallelujah church now we're in a time where wrong has become become right and right has become wrong that's right we're in that day Hall can you imagine a church that has come through that and made their made it to the other side now we're in heaven Hallelujah and we're waiting to see Jesus Hallelujah you think we're just going to be sitting there nice and quiet with a halfway smirk on our face have you guys ever heard the song the more that I Surrender sister Brenda Lewis wrote that song but she also wrote

she's sitting there because she's a gifted person she's going to be with the Lord now but because she's a gifted person in that time of adversity her gift start to operate I hope you're catching that in your time of adversity the gift of God should operate in your life Hallelujah whatever that may be if you're a worshipper you ought to be able to lift your hands in adversity and give God thanks if you're a prayer Warrior you have to be able to get on your Le knees and pray through Hallelujah whatever it is however God uses you when adversity comes that gift should come alive but in that moment the Hurricane's beating a house and beating the house Hallelujah these words to a song start to come to her in the midst of all that wind and winds can get up to 150 miles per hour and it's beating on the house trees are falling down all these things and the words of the song start coming strong winds are blowing with an unrelenting Force but it's it's going to take a stronger wind in this to keep me from my promises it's going to take a stronger win than this to turn me around it's going to take a stronger win than this because my feet are on Solid Ground and that song that song came to her in the midst of a hurricane now can you imagine sister Brenda who wrote that song She Wrote uh little by little strong rugged soldiers on and on on and on can you imagine that sister right that song in
