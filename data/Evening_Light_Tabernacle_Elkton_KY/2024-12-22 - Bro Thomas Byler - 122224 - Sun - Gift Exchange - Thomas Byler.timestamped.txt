[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:52] on Amen aren't you happy to be Christian
[1:24:54] this morning and this time of the Season
[1:24:57] we can just celebrate the birth of our
[1:24:59] savior and the death Buri on
[1:25:02] Resurrection of our savior I was
[1:25:04] listening to the songs and I I I'm not
[1:25:06] supposed to be up here saying anything
[1:25:08] to be honest but the Lord kept pressing
[1:25:10] something on me that that I learned this
[1:25:12] morning to share and I thought well I'll
[1:25:14] do it at this point at this point and
[1:25:15] then finally I thought I we just let it
[1:25:17] go and then Brother David looks at me he
[1:25:18] said you got something to say I said
[1:25:19] yeah I do so we'll just do what the Lord
[1:25:22] leads okay but I I I heard the story
[1:25:25] this morning and as the girls played the
[1:25:27] song and lay Away in a Manger and the
[1:25:30] story of the of the manger and I thought
[1:25:32] how how uh important it was you know
[1:25:35] nothing we happens in life happens
[1:25:37] without a reason and you know we hear
[1:25:39] about Mary and and the things that
[1:25:41] happened on that day and and then you
[1:25:43] hear about the manger and when I heard
[1:25:45] the story of the manger today it just
[1:25:47] struck out to me how important the
[1:25:49] little things in life are you know that
[1:25:51] manger we see it as a as a wooden manger
[1:25:55] that with hay and straw in it and but
[1:25:57] what it really was it was a it was a
[1:25:59] carved out Stone feed trough is the way
[1:26:02] it was it was a and what they would do
[1:26:04] the significance of that manger being
[1:26:07] Stone it was solid so when the perfect
[1:26:09] lamb was born if of the sheep when that
[1:26:14] perfect lamb was born the one who would
[1:26:16] take away the sins of the world the one
[1:26:17] who was spotless the one who was without
[1:26:19] fault or blemish when that lamb was born
[1:26:22] the Shepherds would take that lamb and
[1:26:24] lay it in that stone manger so that
[1:26:27] nothing could harm that little sheep
[1:26:30] that perfect lamb and Mary do you think
[1:26:32] she knew what she was doing when she
[1:26:34] wrapped him up and she laid that little
[1:26:36] baby in that stone manger and said here
[1:26:38] is the Lamb of
[1:26:40] God that'll take away the sins of the
[1:26:43] world on that very Christmas morning
[1:26:46] there and you know and I thought about
[1:26:47] that and they said you know they the the
[1:26:48] wise men they brought myrr when they
[1:26:51] hung him on the cross the Bible says
[1:26:53] they gave gave him wine laced with myrr
[1:26:56] and he received it not and and when they
[1:26:59] was in the when he was laying in that
[1:27:00] manger they said he would be called
[1:27:02] Emanuel for God is with us they mocked
[1:27:05] him and called him King of the
[1:27:08] Jews what an important gift Jesus was to
[1:27:11] us let's just sing that chorus again and
[1:27:14] and as we invite our pastor to come and
[1:27:15] he's got a a message for us this morning
[1:27:18] and I come expecting did you come
[1:27:19] expecting this morning amen let's just
[1:27:22] sing that chorus if we could Carson

[1:30:26] and that which we feel Lord that you've
[1:30:27] laid Upon Our Hearts to speak in Jesus
[1:30:30] name amen I was just thinking this
[1:30:32] morning amen the Lord amen yesterday I
[1:30:35] was pondering on what the Lord would
[1:30:37] have me to
[1:30:39] speak amen and uh I thinking of my
[1:30:43] series I was thinking of just kind of
[1:30:45] thinking of what I might what I want to
[1:30:47] say or whatever and I didn't really know
[1:30:49] what I wanted to say and something come
[1:30:51] to me well this is Christmas if you
[1:30:52] can't preach at Christmas I don't know
[1:30:54] that you can
[1:30:55] preach I mean come on you know you know
[1:30:59] so I mean I don't know maybe that was
[1:31:02] the Lord talking to me but I thought
[1:31:04] yeah that's about right if you can't
[1:31:06] preach at Christmas time I don't know if
[1:31:07] you can so amen and then I just begin to
[1:31:10] think and the Lord begin to lay
[1:31:12] something on my heart and and he just
[1:31:14] give me something that I like when he
[1:31:16] does that amen and it was just a a
[1:31:18] simple thought it was so simple that I
[1:31:20] thought you know but I learned something
[1:31:24] that no matter how simple it is if it's
[1:31:26] of the Lord that's what you need to do
[1:31:28] amen amen and so uh we want to share
[1:31:32] that with you and I thought this morning
[1:31:33] as I got up and the Sun was shining cold
[1:31:36] winry day and I thought we're fixing to
[1:31:38] go to church first of all isn't that a
[1:31:40] wonderful thing to be able to go to
[1:31:41] church and then to have something on
[1:31:43] your heart that God has laid on your
[1:31:45] heart to bring to the people so you have
[1:31:47] a AR rest so to speak and and you're not
[1:31:50] nervous or anything you realize what God
[1:31:52] wants you to say amen and then uh I
[1:31:56] thought that's just wonderful be amen
[1:31:58] because amen when God gives me something
[1:32:00] so we appreciate that and I trust amen
[1:32:03] it'll be a blessing to you this morning
[1:32:06] a simple message amen uh and I want to
[1:32:09] title it gift exchange gift exchange
[1:32:14] amen it'll be a Christmas message amen
[1:32:17] praise the Lord amen I know some people
[1:32:20] don't believe in Christmas and all that
[1:32:21] and and I and I've said well well
[1:32:24] brother brandham called it his Christmas
[1:32:26] message so if he did it it' be all right
[1:32:28] amen so praise the Lord so if you will
[1:32:31] turn your Bibles amen and this is

[1:32:36] message just centered around the simple
[1:32:39] gospel amen just preaching the simple
[1:32:43] gospel amen amen that God has given us
[1:32:47] amen and so I trust it'll be a blessing

[1:33:24] we know that this is the season of
[1:33:27] exchanging gifts isn't it amen and we
[1:33:30] realize I think yeah as far as I know as
[1:33:33] much as I know about it amen perhaps
[1:33:36] they get it out of the Bible where they
[1:33:37] brought gifts to Jesus ain't that right
[1:33:40] gold frankincense and mura they brought
[1:33:42] their gifts to him and so forth and so
[1:33:45] we want to see talk about gift
[1:33:48] exchange how many knows that Jesus
[1:33:50] Christ wrapped in that uh swaddling
[1:33:53] cloth laying in the major was the
[1:33:55] greatest gift God ever gave to mankind
[1:33:58] that was the greatest gift amen why
[1:34:00] because it was the key he was the key or
[1:34:04] should we say the door for Humanity to
[1:34:08] come back into fellowship with him amen
[1:34:10] that Adam lost in the fall so what a
[1:34:13] Monumental time amen I'm going to read
[1:34:17] this and then we'll just try to get
[1:34:18] started amen and you know we just follow
[1:34:21] the leading of the spirit this morning
[1:34:23] if we go a little extra long just bear
[1:34:25] with us is that okay we want to try to
[1:34:28] convey what the Holy Spirit wants us to
[1:34:30] say Amen Mark 8 and verse
[1:34:37] 34 and when he had called the disciples
[1:34:40] called the people unto him with his
[1:34:42] disciples also he said unto them
[1:34:44] whosoever will come after me let him
[1:34:46] deny himself take up his cross and
[1:34:50] follow me for whosoever will save his
[1:34:53] life shall lose it and whosoever will
[1:34:54] lose his life for my sake and the
[1:34:56] gospels the same shall save it for what
[1:35:00] a man profit what shall it profit a man
[1:35:04] if he shall gain the whole world and
[1:35:06] lose his own soul or what shall a man
[1:35:10] give in
[1:35:11] exchange for his soul amen whosoever
[1:35:16] therefore shall be ashamed of me in my
[1:35:18] words in this adulterous and sinful
[1:35:21] generation of him also shall the son of
[1:35:23] man be ashamed when he cometh in the
[1:35:26] glory of his father with his Holy Angels
[1:35:29] amen Isaiah
[1:35:32] 1 and verse
[1:35:37] 18 come now and let us reason together
[1:35:40] sayeth the Lord though your sins be as
[1:35:43] Scarlet they shall be as white as snow
[1:35:46] though they be red like Crimson they
[1:35:48] shall be as wool may God add His
[1:35:51] blessings to the reading of the word you
[1:35:52] can be see that you might say well
[1:35:54] that's awful strange Christmas
[1:35:56] scriptures am mean normally we would
[1:35:58] talk and read about him laying in the
[1:36:00] manger and so forth but we want to go
[1:36:02] and jump ahead just a little bit with
[1:36:04] the help of the Lord amen you know I was
[1:36:08] thinking back there that there was a ma
[1:36:10] there was a time when Humanity was
[1:36:13] ignorant right we didn't we didn't know
[1:36:16] just exactly what God expected of us
[1:36:19] amen amen man in ignorance didn't really
[1:36:22] know just what to do thought about
[1:36:24] Israel and how that they uh murmured and
[1:36:26] complained and how they were bit of the
[1:36:28] serpents and a a and wouldn't it have
[1:36:31] been maybe wouldn't it maybe have been
[1:36:33] better or or should we say what would
[1:36:35] have been like if God says now look
[1:36:38] before we get out of this Egypt before
[1:36:40] we leave Egypt I want everybody to
[1:36:42] understand there's some really strange
[1:36:44] things coming down to shoot you're going
[1:36:47] to come up against things that you won't
[1:36:49] know what to do which way to turn but
[1:36:52] don't never complain don't never
[1:36:55] murmur all right always just trust your
[1:36:57] leader and he could have made it so
[1:36:59] simple but he didn't he blindsided them
[1:37:03] is that right he just let them out led
[1:37:06] him down to the Red Sea and just bam
[1:37:09] there they were stuck and they didn't
[1:37:11] know for sure what to
[1:37:13] do and they complained they murmured God
[1:37:16] didn't like their murmuring and
[1:37:18] complaining he didn't like Moses
[1:37:20] murmuring and complaining but you know
[1:37:22] and I thought you know fool me
[1:37:24] once ain't that right fool me once
[1:37:27] that's on
[1:37:28] you but fool me
[1:37:31] twice what does it say then it's on me
[1:37:36] so you see folks if you don't know and
[1:37:38] you don't understand amen maybe you get
[1:37:40] caught and you do something wrong well
[1:37:42] you know that may be in another person's
[1:37:45] situation another person's fault but
[1:37:47] once you
[1:37:49] know amen and then you do it again and
[1:37:52] keep doing it then it's on you now how
[1:37:55] many knows that God has made a way for
[1:37:57] us through Jesus Christ he giv us all
[1:38:00] the examples of the Old Testament like
[1:38:03] and Corinthians the 10th chapter he says
[1:38:05] all these things were our examples so
[1:38:08] that we wouldn't do what they did so if
[1:38:11] you still do it it's on
[1:38:13] you can I say this morning if you are
[1:38:16] lost if your soul is lost it's going to
[1:38:19] be on you not God
[1:38:26] amen I was listening brother Bram
[1:38:28] yesterday and he made a statement that I
[1:38:29] thought was profound and I didn't
[1:38:31] remember him saying he says the number
[1:38:33] primary one way for God to speak to
[1:38:37] you the number one way for God to speak
[1:38:40] to anybody he says is the word of God
[1:38:44] through
[1:38:46] preachers that's right is that what
[1:38:49] Jesus said after he rose up again he
[1:38:51] said go ye into all the world and what
[1:38:55] preach the gospel that's right so the
[1:38:57] primary way for anybody to get saved for
[1:39:00] anybody to hear the word of the Lord is
[1:39:02] through the fivefold ministry through
[1:39:05] ministering so this morning we stand
[1:39:09] here just in that
[1:39:12] situation that right first of all the
[1:39:15] preacher has to be yielded to God he
[1:39:18] don't fear man he don't cater to man or
[1:39:22] what man thinks or what he thinks
[1:39:24] himself
[1:39:26] amen but he follows the leading of the
[1:39:28] Holy Spirit and it's God speaking
[1:39:30] through the fivefold ministry so I
[1:39:33] thought that was all right I really like
[1:39:35] that of course how many knows we've all
[1:39:36] got a still Small Voice that speaks to
[1:39:38] us we've got a personal relation with
[1:39:41] God and he speaks to us and he shows us
[1:39:43] thing but the number one way is this
[1:39:45] right here this morning is what you're
[1:39:47] listening to amen so I want to say this
[1:39:50] morning amen God has given us every
[1:39:52] example we've had all of history think
[1:39:54] about it we've had Luther Wesley
[1:39:56] Pentecost we've had acts we've had got
[1:39:58] the Bible I mean we got signs wonders
[1:40:00] we've had a prophit in our generation
[1:40:03] come and show the power of the
[1:40:05] resurrected Jesus like never before
[1:40:08] service after service there is no excuse
[1:40:11] man I was thinking back there all the
[1:40:13] evidence that God has shown in this
[1:40:15] generation amen and that people still
[1:40:17] don't get it it's going to be on
[1:40:19] them amen and the world who who to whom
[1:40:23] much is given to them much will be
[1:40:29] required it'll be more tolerable he said
[1:40:32] in Sodom and gomor and in the in the age
[1:40:34] that he was living in it'll be more
[1:40:36] tolerable ain't that right because why
[1:40:39] they would have repented in days of Noah
[1:40:41] I'm Jonah he says you know in days of no
[1:40:43] Jonah if they have had the
[1:40:45] Miracles even they will come up and rise
[1:40:47] up into judgment and condemn this
[1:40:49] generation he said because they repented
[1:40:51] at the preaching of no and Jonah and
[1:40:53] behold a greater than Jonah is
[1:40:55] here
[1:41:02] amen so it's going to be hot it's going
[1:41:04] to be bad for those who reject God after
[1:41:07] seeing him
[1:41:08] infallible come and Vindicated and
[1:41:10] proven the way that he has in this
[1:41:13] generation let me start first of all
[1:41:16] realize that God is always giving
[1:41:19] gifts God always give gifts
[1:41:24] amen you sitting there is a
[1:41:28] gift your life is a
[1:41:32] gift you being alive is a
[1:41:35] gift we understand through the prophet
[1:41:37] and how he taught how that when a when a
[1:41:39] man and woman come together and in the
[1:41:41] conception there is another million
[1:41:44] different persons that could have been
[1:41:46] born besides
[1:41:47] you but they'll just go through each
[1:41:49] other and the two will come together the
[1:41:52] act and so forth and and just the one
[1:41:54] that God ordains to life comes together
[1:41:56] and you
[1:41:58] become Ain that right give life itself
[1:42:02] is a gift of God the breath that you
[1:42:04] breid it's a gift of God the pews that
[1:42:07] you sit on it's a gift of God the world
[1:42:10] that you're in it's a gift of God God
[1:42:12] has given us everything he has given us
[1:42:14] the whole
[1:42:16] world and now what will we give
[1:42:19] back what will you give back
[1:42:26] amen and people I thought about back
[1:42:29] there how that
[1:42:30] people uh just really don't realize how
[1:42:35] valuable they really
[1:42:38] are every soul in here is worth 10,000
[1:42:43] Worlds the Bible says here that what
[1:42:46] will a man give an exchange for a
[1:42:50] soul cuz you haven't profited one fit if
[1:42:54] you gain the whole
[1:42:55] world and if you lose your
[1:43:02] soul we know this here it's only a
[1:43:05] temporary body it's only a temporary
[1:43:09] house a that right on the inside of that
[1:43:13] is called what do you call a spirit
[1:43:14] there's a spirit that you're driven by
[1:43:17] the soul is driven by a
[1:43:20] spirit and it even doesn't go to where
[1:43:23] it's supposed to it stays here God takes
[1:43:25] his man but not his Spirit devil takes
[1:43:28] his man but not his
[1:43:29] Spirit but what's important is not so
[1:43:32] much a spirit even though it's important
[1:43:34] that you're driven by the Holy Ghost but
[1:43:36] it better be that that soul that soul is
[1:43:39] what's
[1:43:40] important and that's what you are that's
[1:43:42] you on the inside of the inside that is
[1:43:45] your
[1:43:47] soul it's you is that right and that's
[1:43:52] worth everything
[1:43:55] and people most of the time well let me
[1:43:58] just back up a little and how that we go
[1:44:01] after 50 years old how we're supposed to
[1:44:03] go to the doctor and we're supposed to
[1:44:06] get our heart checked out we're supposed
[1:44:08] to get our head checked out we're
[1:44:09] supposed to get others our insides
[1:44:12] checked out is't that
[1:44:13] right all kinds of different tests that
[1:44:16] we'll do to make sure there ain't a
[1:44:18] cancer there's not a little growth
[1:44:20] there's not little this or that or the
[1:44:21] other Wom and amen and checking
[1:44:24] mammograms and things like that just to
[1:44:26] make sure nothing's there a that right
[1:44:30] why they'll do that because why they
[1:44:32] don't want to there something in there
[1:44:33] that's going to take their life we'll go
[1:44:36] on diets man the doctors everything
[1:44:38] exercise and the way you eat amen make
[1:44:40] sure you eat right make sure you
[1:44:42] exercise
[1:44:43] right and that right all for what all
[1:44:46] for this outside body that's going to
[1:44:49] perish anyway but they don't take care
[1:44:51] of that Soul that's under the inside
[1:44:53] that's worth 10,000 worlds folks I
[1:44:56] believe it's time amen people won't come
[1:44:58] to church they won't go to the hospital
[1:45:00] amen and let the preacher let the word
[1:45:02] of come word of God come anden begin to
[1:45:04] tell you amen find out where your heart
[1:45:06] is where your desires
[1:45:08] are see where you are at with
[1:45:12] God how is your soul
[1:45:15] doing that's what's
[1:45:18] important people most of the time let me
[1:45:20] tell you something most of the people in
[1:45:21] this world Amen don't never really take
[1:45:24] inventory of their soul until they come
[1:45:26] down to the door death then they realize
[1:45:29] oh man I shouldn't have done this and I
[1:45:31] shouldn't have done that I shouldn't
[1:45:33] have been this way and I should have
[1:45:34] cared more about
[1:45:35] that
[1:45:37] huh why because they realize that they
[1:45:40] got to go and meet an awesome God Amen
[1:45:42] that perhaps they have not served all
[1:45:44] their
[1:45:45] life cuz you're going to meet God how
[1:45:47] many knows he said anybody that
[1:45:50] confesses me before men I will confess
[1:45:52] him before to my father and all the
[1:45:55] whole hosts of heaven but he that denies
[1:45:59] me I will also deny
[1:46:01] him oh it's got to be a reality to every
[1:46:05] one of us there's a land beyond the
[1:46:06] river there's a heaven to go to a hell
[1:46:09] to shun a judgment to
[1:46:13] shun that's
[1:46:15] right it's going to be just as sure as
[1:46:18] this Leo Wicked Sodom and Gomorrah age
[1:46:21] is fixing to get burned up there's going
[1:46:22] to be be a heaven and a new Earth people
[1:46:26] are just so unconcerned about their soul
[1:46:29] we should take a daily test is't that
[1:46:31] right we take I don't know about you but
[1:46:33] I take a bunch a whole handful of
[1:46:35] vitamins every day yeah omega-3 I like
[1:46:38] you know omega-3 and apple cider vinegar
[1:46:41] pills and on and on and on that's right
[1:46:44] why because I know I don't like this
[1:46:46] little thing here hurting me and if I
[1:46:49] don't it goes to hurting a little H that
[1:46:50] hurt ain't supposed to be there you know

[1:47:05] open heart
[1:47:07] surgery I don't want to eat all that
[1:47:09] pork and everything else like I do and
[1:47:11] and one of these days have to go in and
[1:47:13] have about five different blockages we
[1:47:14] want to try to avoid that if we can
[1:47:18] amen why because we're concerned but

[1:56:11] going to cost
[1:56:13] [Laughter]
[1:56:18] you might not make a lick sense I don't
[1:56:22] care if it don't that's what the Bible
[1:56:23] says and that's the way I see it he
[1:56:26] theyy hello you could have never bought
[1:56:28] it if you went to Calvary and they stuck
[1:56:31] those things in your hands and put it on
[1:56:32] your side and crucified you you'd have
[1:56:35] been a rotten dead sinner that's all
[1:56:38] you'd have been but when he died he paid
[1:56:40] the price He Paid a Debt he did not owe
[1:56:44] I owed a debt I could not pay how many
[1:56:47] glad that he paid the price for you and
[1:56:49] he gives it to you free but you've just
[1:56:52] got to give him your old tattered
[1:56:54] garments you got to give him your life
[1:56:56] you got to come at the altar and say God
[1:56:59] I give you my life unreservedly
[1:57:02] here
[1:57:05] amen praise be to God that's
[1:57:10] right see the Bible says the wages of
[1:57:15] sin is

[1:57:29] much labor and so much time he gives you
[1:57:32] some cash
[1:57:33] money a that right that's right an
[1:57:37] exchange the Bible says what are you
[1:57:39] going to give in exchange for your
[1:57:44] soul most people just want to keep their
[1:57:46] life that's your
[1:57:48] exchange I just want to do what I want

[1:57:53] want to live it go ahead you have that
[1:57:58] option remember the rich that rich man
[1:58:02] that had everything Lazarus stood at his
[1:58:05] gate begging and everything else didn't
[1:58:08] have nothing but he was a Christian
[1:58:10] after a while the Lazarus that was a
[1:58:12] Christian he went to the bosom of
[1:58:14] Abraham is that right Jesus tells about
[1:58:17] it and the rich man found himself

[1:59:15] it care not to try to go there everybody
[1:59:18] else is well I don't
[1:59:20] care how many's glad that God put a
[1:59:22] little care in here I'm glad I care

[1:59:43] enough what would you have done if You'
[1:59:46] had been that Rich Young
[1:59:48] Ruler what would you have done
[1:59:52] that's what I wanted to
[1:59:54] hear if you're a Christian this morning
[1:59:57] if you completely sold out to God that's
[1:59:59] what you'd have done because that's what
[2:00:01] you did you don't care I don't care if
[2:00:04] he wants me to be a pper I don't care
[2:00:06] what God wants me to be that's what I
[2:00:09] want to be whatever he wants me to be my
[2:00:11] life is
[2:00:13] his that's how you get somewhere with
[2:00:17] God and back then you would have said
[2:00:19] the same thing but what about the
[2:00:20] disciples remember come follow me they
[2:00:23] left all they left everything their fish
[2:00:25] nuts wherever they were and they went
[2:00:27] and followed him how many believes that
[2:00:30] call is still going on way back down
[2:00:33] here in leadsa 2024 that Call's still
[2:00:36] amen going out call and follow
[2:00:42] me praise be to God that voice is still
[2:00:46] crying out Cain he didn't want the deal
[2:00:50] the deal was God himself came and say
[2:00:53] now King just do like your brother did
[2:00:55] and I'll accept
[2:00:58] you huh I'll accept you just do like
[2:01:02] your brother that's all he had to know
[2:01:03] but no not
[2:01:07] Cain why because the Bible says he's
[2:01:09] that Wicked one he didn't want
[2:01:14] it no he wanted that hatred a little bit
[2:01:19] more you know I don't think I would be
[2:01:21] wrong in in presuming Brother Brad I
[2:01:24] don't think I'd be wrong in presuming
[2:01:27] that Cain didn't want to repent he was
[2:01:29] kind of glad he met killed his brother
[2:01:32] he kept that same attitude I'm glad I
[2:01:34] killed him now he's out of my hair why
[2:01:36] because that same vengful spirit I mean
[2:01:39] as you think through that spirit and he
[2:01:41] never got rid of that Spirit he wouldn't
[2:01:44] repent when God told him to repent do
[2:01:46] what's right he wouldn't do it same way
[2:01:48] with the scribes and the Pharisees we
[2:01:51] know that the a man of ain't nobody can
[2:01:53] raise up last for and they of God but
[2:01:56] we're jealous of the crowds that you
[2:01:59] have the popularity that you have they
[2:02:01] had pride in their
[2:02:03] hearts amen they wouldn't confess that
[2:02:05] they were wrong that they needed to
[2:02:07] repent they kept that same attitude
[2:02:10] until they crucified him away with him
[2:02:12] away with him we don't want that gift it
[2:02:15] didn't come the way we wanted it to come
[2:02:18] I mean that's another problem with the
[2:02:19] world today is it doesn't come the way
[2:02:21] that they think that it'll come all the
[2:02:24] churches man it's got to be Amish it's
[2:02:25] got to be menite it's got to be that
[2:02:27] that w't come in any of that
[2:02:30] stuff and if it don't come their way
[2:02:32] well they just don't want it they don't
[2:02:34] care how many people were raised from
[2:02:35] the dead how many Open the Eyes of the
[2:02:36] blind how much discernment was going on

[2:17:27] trait repent every one of you is that
[2:17:33] right I'm going to read it I know I can
[2:17:37] probably rehearse it but I want to just
[2:17:38] read that before I

[2:17:45] more you love him this
[2:17:49] morning I would say sorry I get a little

[2:17:55] all amen if you join me it won't bother
[2:17:58] me a
[2:18:01] bit amen cuz God is good isn't
[2:18:04] he verse 37 then when all of the well
[2:18:07] I'll go back a little bit when they were
[2:18:09] preaching to the house of Israel and so
[2:18:12] forth Peter says therefore let all the
[2:18:14] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[2:18:16] has made this same Jesus whom you have
[2:18:19] crucified talking about people whom they
[2:18:21] had crucified
[2:18:25] him both Lord and Christ and when they
[2:18:28] heard this they were pricked in their
[2:18:30] heart and said to Peter and to the rest
[2:18:32] of the Apostles men and Brethren what
[2:18:34] shall we do he mean how many knows
[2:18:37] that's what we need to know what in the
[2:18:38] world are we going to do Peter says unto
[2:18:41] him turn around repent from your sins
[2:18:44] the problem is a lot of people want
[2:18:46] Christ they want the new birth they want
[2:18:47] to they want they want eternal life but
[2:18:49] they don't want to repent
[2:18:51] they don't want to turn from their own
[2:18:52] Wicked way you've got to make a deal
[2:18:54] with God God I give it all up I give it
[2:18:56] all up to you I repent and be baptized
[2:19:00] in every one of you in the name of Jesus
[2:19:02] Christ for the remission of your sins
[2:19:04] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:19:07] Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your
[2:19:10] children to us down in leosia all the
[2:19:13] way to mark all the way to anybody that
[2:19:15] ever will come
[2:19:17] in the promise I promise you I'll give
[2:19:20] give it to if you
[2:19:22] [Applause]
[2:19:28] repent now I'm
[2:19:32] Ready the reason that people don't want
[2:19:34] to receive this rap package because they
[2:19:37] know what's on the inside of
[2:19:40] it and they didn't want
[2:19:43] it that's the reason churches and people
[2:19:46] today in the governments in the lands
[2:19:48] will not receive Christ Christmas
[2:19:50] present is because they know what's in
[2:19:53] it they don't want it it'll make women
[2:19:57] act different it'll make men act
[2:19:59] different amen you'll have to bear the
[2:20:02] name of fanatic maybe you'll have to
[2:20:04] take the away with the Lord's just by
[2:20:06] few you'll have to clean up your life
[2:20:09] you'll have to quit your meanness you'll
[2:20:12] have to stop doing wrong and cheating
[2:20:14] and stealing and lying and committing
[2:20:17] adultery you'll have to stop those
[2:20:18] things and the people don't want
[2:20:22] that amen they don't want it it brings
[2:20:25] too much truth to them it uncovers their
[2:20:28] sins so therefore they don't want it
[2:20:31] they want nothing to do with it they
[2:20:32] keep away from it
[2:20:35] amen oh my they don't want it why cuz
[2:20:39] when you get the baptism of the Holy
[2:20:43] Ghost it'll take the desires of those
[2:20:45] things away from you and if you're still
[2:20:48] wanting them he can't give you the Holy
[2:20:50] Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost is a nature to
[2:20:52] change yours to God's
[2:20:57] nature woo you'll love to abstain from
[2:21:05] Evil I was behind the vehicle yesterday
[2:21:07] up here at the light the guy stepped
[2:21:09] that stopped at the light and then just
[2:21:11] it was red he just went on I looked both
[2:21:13] ways I said that guy just ran the stop
[2:21:17] sign and I told honey I guess it's not
[2:21:19] much different than breaking his speed
[2:21:23] limit I mean he's breaking the law
[2:21:26] either
[2:21:28] way all right but how many know the holy
[2:21:31] spirit makes you sensitive makes you
[2:21:32] want to do
[2:21:33] right makes you love your neighbor makes
[2:21:36] you love your enemy makes me love
[2:21:39] everybody oh give me that old time
[2:21:41] religion how many wants more of that old
[2:21:44] time
[2:21:45] religion it was good for Paul and Silas
[2:21:48] it was good for the prophet of God it's
[2:21:50] good for you and I take the desires of
[2:21:53] sin away from you makes you want to live
[2:21:57] holy before God but people don't want it
[2:21:58] the churches didn't want God's wrapped
[2:22:00] gift they don't want no PR they don't
[2:22:02] want no trade and no presence why
[2:22:04] because it would take away from their
[2:22:06] Prestige and their
[2:22:07] pride
[2:22:09] amen but oh
[2:22:11] my praise be to
[2:22:13] God all right let's turn the
[2:22:16] corner praise the
[2:22:18] Lord I love that don't you promises to
[2:22:21] you to your children to them that are
[2:22:23] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[2:22:24] shall
[2:22:28] call I'll throw this in y'all got a
[2:22:30] little extra time all right let me throw
[2:22:33] this how many knows that another gift
[2:22:34] that God gave to the
[2:22:36] church a gift that a lot of
[2:22:40] times we ignore and we don't really
[2:22:47] realize that is in Ephesians when he
[2:22:51] ascended chapter 4: 8 when he when he
[2:22:54] says when he ascended on high he led
[2:22:56] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[2:23:00] men I'm here to tell you that God Is A
[2:23:02] Gift
[2:23:04] Giver what did he give when he went up
[2:23:08] to heaven he gave gifts send back some
[2:23:10] more gifts he gave some Apostles and
[2:23:12] Prophets evangelists pastors and
[2:23:15] teachers how many know you operate what
[2:23:19] the gift you're looking at the
[2:23:24] gift this is Thomas berer right here but
[2:23:28] if I have the gift of Pastor then
[2:23:30] there's a god-given God ordained gift on
[2:23:33] the inside and you're enjoying the gift
[2:23:36] of
[2:23:36] God is that right every Church servers
[2:23:39] you get a gift God sends a gift every
[2:23:41] time an evangelist comes by and what is
[2:23:44] it for the perfecting of the Saints for
[2:23:46] the work of the ministry for the
[2:23:48] edifying of the body of Christ he G
[2:23:50] gives you a gift that edifies you till
[2:23:53] we all come to Perfection till we come
[2:23:55] to the Statue of a major the perfect man
[2:23:58] that's what it's to do so all of that is
[2:24:01] a gift of God so when a evangelist comes
[2:24:05] and steps on your toes and preaches to
[2:24:07] fight say thank you Lord for your
[2:24:09] gift it gives you a gift that blesses
[2:24:13] you not going to go over into First
[2:24:15] Corinthians there it talks about there's
[2:24:17] many de diversities of gifts and helps
[2:24:19] and governments and everybody out there
[2:24:21] God distributes gifts out there helps
[2:24:25] governments healings and faith and all
[2:24:27] these things how many we're a body we're
[2:24:29] all been given something to do something
[2:24:33] with oh my praise be to
[2:24:37] God Amen so Lord help
[2:24:42] us
[2:24:44] amen all right let's turn to our
[2:24:48] conclusive
[2:24:51] scripture and that is going to be
[2:24:57] in St John St
[2:25:03] John praise the
[2:25:10] Lord St John
[2:25:15] 1 amen
[2:25:22] I stand this
[2:25:24] morning Minister of the
[2:25:27] Gospel
[2:25:30] amazed
[2:25:35] dumbfounded and at a place of
[2:25:40] Wonder of
[2:25:42] how that God has made all that he has
[2:25:46] made and yet there's so few people that
[2:25:49] really know
[2:25:51] him they don't really know
[2:25:55] him he hides himself in
[2:25:58] humility and
[2:26:01] simplicity and if it's because people's
[2:26:04] minds really aren't open I mean You' got
[2:26:07] to open your mind and you got to open
[2:26:09] your heart for him to come
[2:26:12] in and all the different
[2:26:14] things the whole world the Bible says he
[2:26:17] was in the world the world was made by
[2:26:20] him and the world knew him
[2:26:24] not they don't know their own
[2:26:29] maker that's pretty
[2:26:31] sad the condition that the world in is
[2:26:34] pretty
[2:26:35] sad and may I say this any individual
[2:26:38] where Christ isn't in your world you're
[2:26:41] pretty sad you're in a sad place I
[2:26:46] was
[2:26:48] amen I'm thankful that he he came aren't
[2:26:51] you then it says he came to his own he
[2:26:55] came unto his own verse 11 and his own
[2:26:59] received him not I mean those Israelites
[2:27:02] did not receive
[2:27:05] him the most religious people of that
[2:27:07] hour didn't receive him our Prophet come
[2:27:10] along in this generation and said that
[2:27:13] they all the churches out there lead to
[2:27:15] their own understanding and when Jesus
[2:27:18] would come and discern the thoughts
[2:27:19] intents of heart they'd say if you go to
[2:27:22] one of them meetings we'll excommunicate
[2:27:24] you they put him
[2:27:27] out the very Church world that we you
[2:27:30] and I live in put Christ outside the
[2:27:32] door according to Revelations 3 behold I
[2:27:34] stand at the door and knock he was
[2:27:38] outside the door they had put him out
[2:27:41] amen fulfilled in around 1962
[2:27:44] 1963 when the church world put him out
[2:27:48] amen but
[2:27:50] I like the next verse because there's a
[2:27:55] butt give a butt a hand say thank you
[2:27:58] Jesus for the
[2:28:00] butt but as many as received him to them
[2:28:06] gave he power to become Sons and
[2:28:09] Daughters of God how many sons and
[2:28:12] daughters of God have we got this
[2:28:14] morning why because you didn't make the
[2:28:17] exchange you received him you accepted
[2:28:21] him you're not
[2:28:23] ashamed you're not ashamed to be called
[2:28:25] a
[2:28:26] bromite to follow a prophet of God that
[2:28:29] prophet's a gift that had thus sayth the
[2:28:32] Lord never fail one time brought us back
[2:28:35] to the pure unadulterated word of God
[2:28:38] just like a medicine that's pure amen
[2:28:41] this medicine's absolutely going to cure
[2:28:43] you amen he brought us back to the pure
[2:28:45] word of God and it's curing us amen it's

[2:28:52] twinkling of an
[2:28:56] eye amen as many as received him gave he
[2:28:59] power over evil power over fear power
[2:29:05] over
[2:29:10] depression power over all the powers of
[2:29:14] the enemy how many's glad that you have
[2:29:16] power over all of the enemy power to
[2:29:19] become a son
[2:29:20] and a daughter of God look act and think
[2:29:24] the way that God thinks

[2:29:32] simple as
[2:29:37] that

[2:29:41] simply give your heart your life to
[2:29:46] Jesus Christ

[2:30:23] probably wasn't there maybe David might
[2:30:26] have been there a little bit but I
[2:30:28] believe it's something that God
[2:30:29] sovereignly does to
[2:30:31] us
[2:30:32] sovereignly sure we like to testify
[2:30:35] witness and a lot of times God uses us
[2:30:37] to bring somebody to God
[2:30:41] Amen but it still takes God to
[2:30:44] draw it takes the Holy Spirit to draw
[2:30:47] somebody
[2:30:50] amen and when he
[2:30:53] does he was telling me brother Mark was
[2:30:55] telling me he had four
[2:30:57] overdoses over those four
