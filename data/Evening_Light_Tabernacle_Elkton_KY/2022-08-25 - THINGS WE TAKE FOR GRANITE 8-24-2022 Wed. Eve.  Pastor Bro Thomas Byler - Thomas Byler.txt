sunday service didn't we i mean i was real good god bless you good to see you amen amen and just amen praise the lord wonderful wonderful song service i think brother josh is getting fired up there that's good all right thank you amen all right let's pray kind heavenly father we just come before you lord jesus lord jesus just thankful father once again to be able to bask lord in your presence and to sing songs to you lord and to praise you lord jesus and just honor you lord jesus with our heart and father everything that's within us father we just want to tell you that we are appreciative lord jesus of all that you do for us and for being able to assemble together tonight lord knowing god that wherever two or three are gathered there you would be in our midst lord and we're so grateful of god that you promised that you would never leave us no forsakes even to the end of the world and father we believe that you're in your children lord jesus you're with each one of your sons and your daughters tonight father we just ask god that you'd help me just get out of the way now father as we try to express what you've laid upon our hearts to speak about tonight father bless the reading of the word ministering tonight in jesus christ's name amen and amen praise the lord amen that was good amen everybody said amen praise the lord it's a simple little thought tonight if you want to turn with me to the book of hebrews let's go to hebrews 2. something i've spoken on before but for some reason it just seems like the holy spirit wants to remind us perhaps once again would that be all right hebrews chapter 2. therefore we ought to give the more earnest heat to the things which we have heard at least at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect our greatest salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt them god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own son or his own will may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen i don't know if any of you have looked at the title yet tonight but we want to speak with the help of the lord on things that we take for granted amen things we take for granted amen and also want to speak on negligence amen i was beginning i was thinking about negligence of course we know that to neglect something it's just not to pay a whole lot of attention to it not to take it too serious all right to be slothful about it and so forth uh and also what you take for granted you do add treat pretty much the same way amen so i was thinking you know uh about you know taking things for granted and and so forth the neglection neglection it of course leads to uh taking things for granted and also taking things for granted also goes the other way it means you're neglecting something amen amen i looked looked it up on siri and so forth and it specific you talked about a lot of times perhaps you know your spouse or somebody like that that you would take sometimes for granted things that we take for granted and also an interpretation of it was and often implies a lack of appreciation or gratitude amen a lack of appreciation or lack of or gratitude and i thought we're living in a world that is very much like that people that do not appreciate amen they don't have any gratitude amen for the things that they have now uh for the privileges and i want to talk about privileges for a little bit comedy believes that we're a privileged people we're a privileged people beyond what you can imagine more so than what you realize amen i think our first neglect is realizing how privileged we are the first thing we take for granted is how we how privileged we are amen you know and i was i was thinking of one thing i was thinking about when i kind of come onto this i'm thinking how that they want to come out with these electric cars and they want to go green everything right and i thought well i'll tell you what maybe one of these days i'm gonna be driving this little electric car that they give you because they're already talking about maybe not having people own their own cars and stuff huh yeah but about you're up there just man you're way off but hey they they when they first come out and said they defund the police we all laugh like what what a stupid idea but they did it right you just never know what might happen there but anyway you think about you might have to go and drive a little car that'd run electric and have can go down the chattanooga have to charge it up this that or the other you know you know i thought you know look well i tell you what i appreciate i appreciate i'm thankful tonight to be able to drive and be able to fuel up i thought you know i got to think of how that we never think about these things we hardly ever think about these things and and it's called taking these things for granted now unfortunately if you take two things too much for granted and you neglect those things your life will lose those things isn't that right and when i got to thinking of the whole spectrum of negligence and and taking things for granted it goes a long way don't it and especially in the spiritual realm but i thought i might talk a little bit for just a little while about some of the natural things that we we we take for granted amen praise the lord there's there's so many things and and just like going out and starting our car up let's talk about about that for a minute you know the prophet god said it takes faith just to start your car up do you ever think about knights gonna take faith no you just naturally do it amen and you don't even think about the common faith that you have amen to crank your car up to do those natural things amen even even we take for granted our breathing how many ever thanks god for being able to breathe how many ever appreciative be able to breathe we hardly ever do that do we you don't think about it but how many knows if you amen when you think about you know just those things that those little things that you really don't appreciate a lot of times naturally speaking naturally speaking but you let yourself choke one time yeah you get something caught in your throat one time and find out how much you appreciate if that thing comes out amen that's the same way when you really realize you know because even the prophet said we have no promise of ever going out to swords to make it at home now we don't worry about that do we but we take it for granted that hey you might not we don't think about that people take life oh the whole world takes life in general for granted they act like they're going to live forever huh and that there's no judgment there's they take god for granted which is in the spiritual realm but it takes so much for granted mobility amen to be able to move be able to do and and to be able to walk talk to somebody in a wheelchair amen and and and you know complain about you having to maybe hobble a little because your foot hurts or this that or the other they'll say but you can just be glad that you come on amen you know one thing that this does for me i believe it makes you sensitive to god it makes appreciate makes you appreciate god on a much higher level because i'm here to tell you that i believe it makes us more thankful for everything that you have for everything that you're able to do and i want it to not just be a thankfulness but i want it to be an actual worship amen the actual praise amen for all that god ever does for you and for everything that you have now we all know that us americans the americans and our young people especially maybe not as they're older folks especially not people like brother hershel and sister rivendell some of those that were come through those hard times that depression hey they appreciate everything they're a whole lot more you find those people are a whole lot more appreciative of what they have than the generation that we have now they don't appreciate the things they have they don't appreciate the country near it i mean why do you think a border floods when it's open like it is because they want they want to have a chance at the privilege that you and i have how many believe you're privileged just to live in this country glory yeah yeah if i was in south america if i was in into mexico if i was anywhere there i would probably be flooding too that is coming to this place huh why because we're privileged still we know those privileges the devil's trying to take away but and eventually probably will lose a lot and lot a lot a lot according to the prophet isn't that right even that his church very well could lose this church amen i found that wrong but ibm says meetings like this will be a fond memory right so you'll be a fond memory or something you know we used to get together we used to be able to get together the devil don't want us to get together he hates freedom huh and i think tonight i hope out tonight we appreciate more all the little things amen seeing being able to see right i have appreciated in the last few weeks i'll tell you what you know i've appreciated the you know the times that i could go like that and not everybody was a blur and i took it for granted i never thought about ever losing my sight i never thought about you know yet someday you may have to wear a glass i didn't mind putting them on a little bit for a little ring no problem but every day all the time sweat dripping down i have to wipe them all time you know but we take things for granted that's right hearing hey man if you don't have you know phrase how many glad first being able to see tonight that's right because you ask a blind person fanny crosby says well you're a blessed person huh just because you're able to see just because you can walk just because amen you can speak and praise be to god and all the natural things all the different things that many times we don't appreciate i don't know about you but uh you know when i'm in the shower and got hot water i say thank you lord for a hot shower i try to thank him for everything don't you how many thank him we got to thank him for everything not just for the good things whenever he allows bad things well thank you lord i know you allowed it huh brother tommy back there he's sitting he's a real living witness of this you know he thought hey you know i could i go through life pump iron draw all of this be strong and so forth look what happened huh realize hey you know i'm thankful for every pound i can push right by the time i'm glad for everything i can do i you know i love it i love everything god gave me where before you didn't even think about it you never thought might say maybe something could happen he's an absolute miracle sitting there the very small percentage that make it through that huh god does miracles how many believes if you're ever going to see them i don't i don't know but you i believe if you're a christian you can almost see miracles all the time in your life little things that god does oh i want to see more of them don't you the little things that god does praise be to god oh yeah things like running water huh i mean those man we used to have to go down in the spring at home we used to have to pump it and everything we did have to be pumped but they have running water they have a hot water heater instead of they have to heat water up thank god we ain't got to make a bath all in the same tub anymore everybody gets number 10 my number 10 the water was cold and it was nasty because army's boy they don't watch your feet a whole lot you're gonna get mud in there and whatnot that's right but yeah of course we freshened it up once in a while yeah let me pour a little more in there let me thankful thank thank god thank god for wondering why thank god for a good shower amen a good clean bath let me tell you something we are we are not negligent when it comes to our natural things that's one place we are not negligent huh and we don't take it for granted no we're on top of it but my question is when we come to the house of god are we as clean as we make our body before we come i mean it believes the inside that's what's really important is that we have that right now we don't neglect that that we don't take that for granted amen we thank god for good soaps and everything else he gives us that causes it to be able to smell good and be clean well i don't know about you but i thank god amen that we can be clean on the inside now we've got a hyssop that we've got a blood of jesus christ that cleanses you from all unrighteousness does it make you absolutely clean and smell good good to be around don't you like to be around people that are good to be around we know what brother bran said to certain people you just don't care about being around that person all they ever want to do is run somebody down talk about this talk about that or complain about everything don't you just love a complainer that's right we don't like complaining nobody likes a complaint god don't like a complainer god's quite something isn't it he'll put you between a heart and a rock place and expect you to be happy he expects us to conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials that he's allowed to come away a little hard to do sometime ain't it amen because we got things you know and i know a lot of us here i know a lot of us have done it a lot of us have gotten to the place now i believe that something major can happen in your life and you can take the right attitude target hey the little bitty things that's not so bad but it's when the big things come your way you know the big changes the this big happening and all of a sudden you're gonna really get upset about it or you can say well god will handle that huh i believe it's time that we as christians are mature and when those things come we can conduct ourselves among with with gratitude with praise anyway i've just had a couple of those things happen in the last week man boy that's enough to make mess up your day to ruin your day huh yeah i had a day the other day i just said man it was just a bad day i called it but i said praise the lord anyway god knows i don't understand but god knows believe in god if i could have done something about it i would have but i couldn't so just leave it alone and commit it to god and let your bad days or whatever it might be committed to god and say god you take care of it amen my praise the lord for electricity thank god for power amen how am i glad i'll be glad you know you you flip that switch on and you never say thank you thomas edison when thomas that isn't right yeah yeah not benjamin franklin he had to kite this string and got shocked thomas edison i believe you know perfected it or whatever and did all of that study and all of that work to light it up and you know he was kind of conf no doubt but considered a little bit he's a little crazy he thinks that he can take some kind of juice and run it through the wire and light light the place up [Laughter] look all of them folks are considered a little crazy i don't care they made fun of the ford to miss a ford you know when they started with these little cars and stuff from the car when they you know no doubt they had races in the kids one of them nice good strongholds could probably outrun the first cars they made called a bunch of foolish what's that rattle trap huh but where is it at today huh that's right so we take for granted a lot of time pretty may be able to flip that switch on and say thank you lord jesus amen for the natural things all of those things that light up the whole world people never think about it never appreciate it until your power goes out by internet remember when we first come up here man we had an ice storm and it shut us down for weeks on end and you'd go into the store and everybody that used to hi everybody they were all oh my god everybody was getting grumpy after about three weeks a week or a couple days for us right we can do a couple days but couple three weeks man we already have our power back amen oh my takes so many things for granted our driving privileges i just thought lord thank you lord thank you amen everything all of our modern conveniences am i right why our sisters ought to be the happiest housewives ever huh oh that's right i always told i tell everybody sure i do i help my wife but the dishes i i do my part with dishes i go out and i pay for the washer i install it real good there's my part she's happy with that because lord knows what'll happen if i stick them in there they have a rattling going on probably everything else amen amen so praise god amen thank god that we're living in the hour that we're living in how many knows that we were procrastinated for this hour hey man we've got things we have we have just about everything huh they've got so many gizmos and gadgets and stuff nowadays right folks even your phone it'll do stuff i i'm not i don't even want to learn really you know all the stuff everything it'll do praise god but you know i had to think in the natural in the hour that we're living with everything at our fingertips huh everything that are disclosed we have everything and then i thought you know if everybody was a christian everybody lived godly everybody had the holy ghost then we could dismiss all the police forces brother braham says at the hospitals and all these things you dismiss all of them god take care of it what a wonderful world it would be if everybody was filled with the holy ghost now we know that in all that has been supplied all that we have all that we are privileged the most privileged people in the natural right we're the most privileged people of all time in the natural we have got it the easiest you know it's almost gotten to where if you if you want to stay in shape you better have some workout bench or go for a walk or run uh you don't have to go walk to the job you drive your car there you drive back and you get there and sit and machine does it work or whatever unless you're a carpenter then it requires a little bit of physical or a logger huh so everything in the natural compare so to speak with the spiritual my god shall supply all your need how many believes your need has been supplied amen the opportunity is there you know it's there you're privileged to take advantage of what has been given you of what has been supplied to you in every aspect yet we have homeless people living under bridges and everything else don't we amen it's sad when you look at the homelessness in america and so forth and and philadelphia i believe it is i've watched some of that it goes on in philadelphia down in some of those streets and the people that die like rats down there the drugs and how they're just if you've never seen it i don't know what you want to maybe use adulthood but they've taken on drugs and they actually have stations where they have garbage cans like where you dispose of your needles and everything i just read yesterday where i think in california they're thinking about setting up places where you can inject yourself you used to fight drugs didn't we now we promote it that's the devil in it destroying the people that's what it is it's all it is destroying the people destroying the country and they're practically zombies and so forth and the devil takes them out and it's sad amen yet a privileged people yet everything so much supplied in the natural yet people don't appreciate it and that's why you know realize that they took it for granted no there's a lot of people that simply took it for granted neglected it and lost it amen and whose fault when you think about it think about it whose fault amen brother bam says listen and how shall we escape if we neglect such you neglect to eat you'll die you neglect to turn a corner you'll wreck you neglect the milk the cow she'll go dry you neglect your teeth you'll have to have them pulled out someday you pay for your neglection oh my let me tell you this a lot of times our wives or our husbands can become so common to us until we not only neglect but we take them for granted take them for granted they'll always be there they'll always be there now be careful huh be careful amen you pay for negligence amen and for taking things for granted you certainly do but we're privileged people in the natural and a lot of times when you have it too easy when things become too common to you it's when you begin to take things for granted that's why this wednesday night i don't take this moment for granted lord help me not to take you people for granted how many believes we shouldn't take each other for granted we're all precious brothers we're all precious sisters satan wants to destroy us he'd like to get in between us he'd like to do all of that but don't take each other for granted don't take anything for granted not anything amen praise the lord looking at the spiritual for just a minute amen we realize over in laodicea i mean it was over layout of the chile to see a church age they thought they were rich and increased with goods and had needed nothing but yet they thought they were spiritual didn't it they thought they were spiritual they thought they were right they thought that christ was with them just like joseph and mary did whenever they were going back home from i believe it was paying taxes or something and they were leaving and went home and once a day's journey or so and they realized jesus wasn't with him isn't that right and they had to go back for him and brother bound to preach a message on it talking about he's hot he thought that he was with him and he wasn't that's the way it was in this generation that's the way with all these churches and that's where it is a lot of people all the time they think that he's with them when he's not huh and that's that ain't it they neglected to look and make sure that he was i believe this is the hour of making sure that he is oh my to make sure leodysea they thought they were rich in creative goods pentecost which represented laodicea the last church ace was the pentecost the church age they almost saw them got rich they got increased with goods they had oh they had jump up and dance and music and speaking in tongues and everything else but when you looked at how the women dress and women even became preachers and they certainly didn't do that at the beginning huh they thought that god was with him but he wasn't amen they neglected him they took for granted that he was with them don't take for granted that you've got christ you have to make sure that you have christ how many know tonight that god has supplied us he has supplied us with everything we are spiritually the more more privileged people than all of those were all down through the dark ages we have more tonight more assurance more vindication more proof when i looked up that word privilege and looked down to the computer and it was like 200 of them brother man i'm almost all the time talked about what a privileged people that we are to have christ come right down among us and show us that he's here that he's alive and what is truth and what is right we're a privileged people oh my don't take it for granted don't neglect that like a hebrew says don't neglect this great salvation that god brought [Music] i believe that's what god will tell a lot of people that tell i mean at the judgment he'll tell him why didn't you accept why aren't you saved it was not because i didn't supply it you just took it for granted you neglected it it wasn't the most important in your life oh my i think about it how negligent and how that will boy we'll be on the job we'll be there tomorrow morning people be on the job they won't neglect that that's the income but where's people in the house of god the night before which is more important even the prophet said i'd rather you miss some work than to miss church or sunday school better to miss that than it is a whole lot more important people are more concerned about whether you've got food to eat or clothes where than they are that you look good and you're dressed in the robe of his righteousness oh we wear the best clothes i try to come up here i try to make sure my ties matches my shirt and everything else we try to dress our best huh how about dressing the best spiritually i believe i believe tonight that it's more important that we dress right that we are closing his righteousness that you're full of the holy ghost that you got his move on that you don't take some perfect perfume soap or wash yourself you ought to take the perfume of the holy ghost and wash your soul real good that's more important trying to think of that now it just comes to mind we used to take a bath every two weeks and read our bible every day huh now we take a bath every day and read a bible every two weeks or so anyway one week with our prayer makes one no seven days without prayer makes one week something like that huh that's right glory this does something to me why aren't you why aren't we the kind of christians we ought to be i'll tell you why negligence we need like to take advantage of the opportunity that's in front of us it's the only answer because you cannot blame god when he said it was finished it was finished the prophet said if jesus was up here he couldn't heal you if he was in my suit wearing it he couldn't hear you he'd tell you i already did yeah i already killed you at calvary when it was finished it was finished can you receive it can you accept it amen same way with salvation amen the reason that people were going to hell is because they took it for granted they neglected to hear it they neglected oh my people are more concerned even jesus said isn't that right even just jesus said you know take no thought for your raiment or your food huh for god he knows that you have neither these things i believe that we god supplies those things for us how many believes that sure he does but what did he say seek first the kingdom of god and all these things will be added unto you but people are more concerned about their privilege in their natural than they are for their privilege in the spiritual that's why the church is in the shape it's in that's why the world is in the shape that it's in like i said people think they're going to live for you're not going to live forever you're going to come down and you're going to choke out you from your last breath one of these days like brother baby says i don't care how pretty you are i don't care what a hollywood star you are one of these days you're gonna shrivel up he said and die i like the way he put it that's the truth group up and die yeah i don't know if y'all have seen some of those arnold schwarzeneggers and uh rocky what's his name sylvester stallone or some of them you know and and and and they're shriveling you up they're shriveling up and i'm like boy if we could just if they could just get saved if they could just get a hold of god and realize all of that world is nothing you're nothing without god nothing oh my no wonder jesus said don't think so much about the body but think about that soul that's worth ten thousand worlds we went to a restaurant and if we ask for extra ketchup or mayonnaise they don't have it we'll say look this sandwich ain't made right can i have it made right or as the prophet said we go and get some soup and there's a spider or a bug in the soup we're going to self it say but what's wrong with y'all but we'll let all kinds of little books go in our ear we'll get all kinds of mess go down in our soul huh we got big old snakes and spiders and every kind of mold and mildew a lot of times why because we didn't pray like we should we didn't take advantage of the prayer that we could have had that morning that time with the lord i like what brother brad said about being hid away getting away somewhere and saying god i gotta have more of you that's what it takes to get more of god it's a consecration of saying god i want i got to have more boss man can you let me have off today i need to go somewhere and pray all day today i need to write my bible today give me a break i need a break so that i can feed this soul here i can take care of this a little more how many believe we need to take better care of this better of the soul not this outside but the inside oh my lord help us we'd see so much more of god in our life if we did people don't think there's going to be no judgment they just take it for granted there ain't going to be no judgment i mean is there in for a real rude awakening oh my i want to preach a little bit to our politicians is that all right all of them guys that say we just evolved from monkeys darwin theory and all that other stuff boy are you in for a rude awakening when you die you're gonna realize that you ain't no dead dog you ain't no monkey you're not gonna just stand and that's it you're still gonna be somewhere not only be somewhere but it'd be in a lost torment of a nightmare until god calls you back up and stands you in front of him and you him and judges you that's what you're in for you teach our young peoples that they come from monkeys no wonder they act like a bunch of apes well anyway i'm okay whatever huh animals it was you that did it huh that's right they take it for granted there's no judgment they take god for granted they know god don't even want to believe there is god best way that i can explain there that is what god said about it a fool a fool has said in his heart there is no god you think this can be by chance oh my i don't know if stupid's worse than a fool but whichever it is that's what you are to be able to look at this and then think that there's not a god that put it all together and you know what the biggest thing is i'll tell the the biggest condemnation that will be to this generation is that right there that'll be the greatest condemnation his word will condemn him already it it it's enough to condemn them all but when he got he sends a prophet like he said he was gonna and jesus comes down and does everything he ever did on the on the shores of galilee that is more over and over and over you don't believe that you are going to burn because it was jesus you just don't do that to god it wasn't brother adam that was the pillar of fire above his head it was almighty god and that'll be their biggest condemnation amen can i say one more thing one thing about it i truly believe though that those that are elected those that have their seed on the inside they aren't gonna neglect it they're not gonna take it for granted come on people you ought to be a little louder if you want to know say i'm not going to take it for god i will not link back the baptism of the holy ghost i will not neglect to take opportunity of everything that he supplied for me i can be rich in god like my holy spirit that can be rich in my heart my soul can be full of god but i gotta quit being negligent the holy spirit is calling on you to quit being negligent quit taking these things for granted could take them so insincerely unappreciative we don't appreciate it enough huh my i was thinking on this and i thought man you know how many of us if we knew that something was going to raise up perhaps a new phone system or whatever and it's going to be the biggest ever well you take all your money probably in stock invest in the stock market right because it was going to go way way way up let me tell you something jesus made an investment on calvary and it's the richest thing ever because the biggest thing that people take for granted is their own life people will take their own life for granted huh brother tommy you have a little this past brother tommy took his life no time many times for granted huh any of these people that risk their lives for an adrenaline rush flipping their bikes over and all of that knowing that life could be snuffed out just like that all it takes is one mistake huh you take your life for granted and it isn't until you're in a wheelchair can't walk that you say over and over and over i shouldn't have done that i wish i wouldn't have done that i always should have been smarter huh don't you know that's going to be hell hell is going to be full of people boy i sure wish i would have taken advantage of the cross of calorie i wish i would have taken advantage of john 3 16. where he said whosoever i can't help but believe that somehow or other perhaps in my own mind now well maybe not because we know that that word is what's going to judge people right perhaps before the opening of the judgment day that scripture will be read for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life let's start this judgment let's see who took this for granted huh let's see who neglected this because that's going to be the only answer anybody that ever heard that scripture all you got to do is hear it once how many knows that's all god is obligated to do is to tell you one time you're obligated god is obligated to give it to you one time but he does it over and over and over and over again he's a mercy for god he reaches out his hand to read this doesn't he do that to us time at the time he reaches out amen as i believe proverbs were said i reached out my hand but you would not you would not that's right that'll be a lot of that too you would not you would none of my reproof amen that's right people take for granted this world's going to go on it's not it's not it's coming to a rugged end it's going to have a fire baptism it's going to burn it's coming to an end folks if they would not take that for granted they prepare they say what i gotta do oh my heard something else brother man says man what what consolation you and i have knowing that our economy and our world and everything that there is not one hope for it he said there is a hope and that is only in christ jesus is there any help the only answer people take for granted that jesus is coming back they think he might never come back but they neglect the fact that he's coming back how many knows that's why they'll be left behind well he delays his i don't know you know my i wonder how many message people would be like that i kind of go back out in the world and don't have no hallelujahs in church anymore ain't got no amen ain't got no preaching preacher i sit there and know man i hope you don't hit me too hard tonight huh my instead of amen that's right brother get lukewarm backslid on god why because they let it slip why did we preach this over and over because peter says i want to stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance how many beliefs we as humans well let me bring back you know some some people i guess well they've told me years ago i guess that they didn't need the five-fold ministry because they had come to perfection the five-fold ministry was supporting us in perfection once we come to perfection why would we need faithful ministry anymore well their lives proved that they really needed a preacher i don't think we'll ever not need a preacher because we're forgetful people we have a tendency to let it slip and we need to be brought back in line we need to hear something on the wednesday we need to hear something on a sunday we need to have it again tell it timing again preach it we need that holy spirit to remind us constantly remind us and i believe the prophet of god said we need to checking up time not every hour not every day but every minute of every hour we need to check up see whether we're ready or not amen we'll be good brother we'll be good if we are as rich spiritually as we are physically and financially well i'm not rich motherbot i'm just a punk didn't brother bam say something about even bombs or millionaires here in america why because like when donna was manager at burger king she had somebody come back up there and was it extra ketchup he asked for he come back in there and he took that sandwich and he threw it back way back now i said extra ketchup oh my you talk about small right we have all the time there was no pickle on that sandwich i don't think that they go back and keep that for the next one and add a pickle usually it goes to the garbage can right wrong get it right goes out in the dumpsters then people with pot bellied and india and and that have got sicknesses and everything else they'd be glad to be able to find a nice one like that without pickles they wouldn't mind it at all they say thank you jesus i got a nice one it made a pickle on it but it's great they can do good listen how many believes that we need to be richer spiritually lord jesus help us to be richer spiritually don't let me to neglect that soul people that how many knows people go through their lives and they never really think about their soul it's just something in the background how how is your how is your soul doing you know so hmm what's that apparently probably know what a soul is that's you that's the real you on the inside how's that guy do it not this guy the guy on the inside that one this robe of flesh drops that person that's on the inside it'll still be it doesn't just poof into thin air no that soul is still there how is it soul tonight how do you stand before god oh yeah neglect god neglect forgiveness neglect grace they neglect the great pardon let me know john 3 16 it's a great part now who's your everybody shall not perish but have everlasting life and you can sign your name in there in the nice he left the blank there that whosoever what's your name and if thomas bothers you believe in him he should not perish but have everlasting have eternal life people don't realize how valuable their life is until they come down to the door death then all of a sudden they get a revelation huh like brother brahm says man he's heard a lot of people say boy have my daughter have my son do this and have him do that i didn't do it can they maybe they can do it but everyone says your children and those folks can't do what you should have done you should have done that while you could huh they want to get right mine lord help us we want to be spiritually rich we want to be able to have a light on here how many it's glad for the light it shines in our hearts through the gospel through the holy ghost through the fire because we know that with the fullness of the word fullness of the word coming back brought the fullness of the spirit not just a gift of speaking in tongues or just a parcel but it gave the fullness of the spirit again so you don't have to be partially but you can be full of the holy ghost wash this blood they absolutely spurned absolutely neglect god's mercy his forgiveness my and they squander their life just squander their life let me tell you don't squander your life a lot of times youth how many knows youth is something a lot of times you uh take for granted you take for granted when you're young you don't think about being old no you don't think about being old 30 40. i didn't think about it hey when we had the big party down there sprayed deadly white stuff all over my hair and everything else and put a pair of glasses on me you know i look about like i do now i guess oh man i thought that ain't too bad you know but boom there hit 50 yeah and then 60. folks it doesn't last long make the most of your youth serve the lord with your use use it for the lord that's why i'm glad to see brother tommy here different ones danny different one do something for god that's one thing brother brandon talks do something with whatever you have do something for god don't be idle be doing something for god because it's the only thing that will be worth anything in the end is what did you do for god i'm not going to ask you how successful you were in this side or the other it'll be what did you do for christ what kind of the servant was you amen praise the lord god is good the spiritual privileges god has supplied how many knows he's supplied it's all here we're not living in the machine gun age anymore we're not living in a uh the muzzle loader anymore remember how brother man type the natural with the spiritual and so forth now we're in the atomic age hey amen people used to maybe try to shoot the devil with a gift they have maybe speaking in tongues and use some gift to overcome the devil but what brother brahm says if you want to overcome you have to overcome the way jesus overcome is that right and how did jesus overcome anything it was with the word of god it is written it's also written even the devil would use it you know the scriptures but he'd say it's also written he'd always fight him with the word because we know the word will defeat the devil anytime any place on any grounds it'll defeat him every time not your emotions it has to be that word amen quote him the word tell him what the word says you get sick you say bye stripes i am healed hey let me tell you some in closing if the prophet of god had to get his healing by no great revelation from what i understand not something great come down here but he said he began to claim his claim that we're by his stripes i am healed by his stripes i am healed and he sat at the table with mom and daddy from my understand and he began to eat food that he was not supposed to eat or he would kill him and he began to eat that food and mama was crying don't eat that don't need that huh don't eat that son and man he went to throwing up hey get back down there talk about faith huh take god at his word and see what happens think about that stomach remember that stomach trouble he had he didn't get instant healing years and years and years it bothered him [Music] and then one day the squirrel-like thing to come out of there right amen and god touched him he's over with his eyes that he couldn't barely see because of explosion of different things god healed him and he could see 20 20. how many god does that so let me encourage your feet folks have faith in god doesn't matter what it is you take god at his word he is obligated he will back his word up i want to say this god does not neglect to take care of us we're a privileged people tonight to have a father like what we do amen there was these two birds up in the tree just talking to each other you know one was saying you know why is them all of them humans look how sad they are man they got their heads down years ago i remember they waved each other they'd say how do you do they'd say good morning but now they just pass each other with their head down all sad what do you reckon it is and one says you know maybe maybe they don't have a heavenly father like we do he knows the fall of a sparrow he knows what you have need of he cares he's my heavenly father tonight how many say god i am thankful that i have you for my heavenly father one that cares one that doesn't neglect you he don't neglect us he gives us what we have need of he makes sure you have every vitamin the in the cupboard that you have need of everything to keep you healthy everything you keep happy if you don't have health if you don't have strength and happiness don't blame god god has supplied it for you how many needs more of the joy of the lord the know of the lord is more strength we ought to praise him we ought to worship him say love hallelujah more than what we do every morning the birds get up they go to singing to their type of their voice amazing grace how sweet they sound i know my father he's got a green bean somewhere around he's going to supply for me oh money he's going to supply for me he did praise god that's the problem of god said they don't find they don't have rheumatism and ambulances and everything else you don't see two birds carrying one off to some little somewhere god takes care of them i may please god tell me that god takes care of you tonight let's stand tonight oh my god is good isn't he musicians if you'll come let's just bow our heads a minute before we sing this song by head tonight just ask yourself if there's a lot of things perhaps lately maybe or that you've perhaps neglected neglected to pray you've neglected to read your bible you know if you don't eat you'll starve if you don't drink your thirst to death you'll spiritually die brother bam says if you neglect to eat and so forth so my question tonight how many's neglectful and say god i'm too neglectful too negligent lord well you see the hands mine's up lord i'd be a better person i'd be a better preacher i'd be a better pastor i'd be a better husband i'd be a better grandpa i'd be a better friend if i had more of you lord so lord i'm raising my hands and i'm saying god don't let me take for granted the things that you have supplied lord and i know that you have an abundant supply of your spirit father if we'll just ask and if we'll just pray like we should and read our bibles like we should and focus on you like we should and we've got to ask ourselves lord jesus if you're asking that for focusing more on the flesh or in the spirit lord help us to focus more on the spirit lord jesus you see every hand that is up you know every heart you know every thought that each one is thinking and i ask god that you would help him in the area that they're thinking father i've heard they've been negligent lord and where they have taken things for granted lord help us not to be unappreciative of what you have done but to take full advantage of everything that you have supplied because we are privileged tonight to be able to receive it father in the name of jesus christ right now as we have our hands up we believe god that the mercy and the grace will flow down right into our heart says my heart lord now in a greater away than ever before father we ask god that you just continue lord disturb an evening light tabernacle father you bless every preacher that comes through lord with what we have need of lord and that souls will be drawn closer to you lord backsliders will be brought back to you lord and sinners and be saved lord the lost to be saved father come and have mercy while there's still mercy to be had father come and work your marvelous works father we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen praise be to god praise the lord amen after a sermon like that he always desire the right song just to go into worship and praise in him amen how about heavenly father i appreciate you
