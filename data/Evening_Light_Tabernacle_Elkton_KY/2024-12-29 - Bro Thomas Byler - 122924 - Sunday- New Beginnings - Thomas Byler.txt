morning uh children you can be dismissed we'll go to Ephesian or brother Joe you want to open in prayer yes yes Lord I ask you part service this morning how blessed and thankful we are every uh we'll go to Ephesians 6 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling and singleness of your heart as unto Christ with Good Will doing Service as to the Lord and not to men and ye Masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respective persons with him put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God and for me the that the utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of God of the Gospel but that you also may know my Affairs and how I do uh beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord shall make known to you all things peace be to the Brethren and love with Faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ and Grace be all with them Lord Jesus Christ and sincerity amen Amen brother Brian Lord bless you all sorry about that you know you could spend hours going scripture after scripture in the Ephesians the uh 6th chapter but being you know as coming to to the end of life you know God doesn't like men Pleasers one thing I've learned in life God doesn't like someone that's always sucking up to the boss or always sucking up to someone else or always sucking up to this God likes people that take the faith of God and stand on their own two feet and are willing to go forth with the gospel and bring about changes in their life their family's life and in their Church life I was um if you would go with me to Isaiah the 53rd chapter you know like brother Joe was praying everything we do in life is based on faith everything we do every every promise that we reach out in for is by faith in Jesus Christ this morning and like last Sunday I said how does that Faith come it only comes one way and that's by the word of God it's got to be continually on your lips in your mind and in your heart this morning the word of God itself is the only thing will bring about a change in your life and in the life of your family and just keep going adding and adding adding to it but I was uh we read the 53rd chapter brother TR read the 53rd chapter but you know something else I was thinking about this morning I was after listening to No numerous messages as we come at end of this year you know another year is almost over 2024 the world isn't getting any better it's only getting worse and you know I know that ministers in my life have come up year after year saying the hour is late the time is near there's no time to play church anymore no time to be wishy-washy about your faith and we keep going on another year and another year and another year I can only speak for myself but I can see in my own heart as I get older that's the truth we don't have no continuing cities here in this life the only hope we have this morning is the grace of God in Jesus Christ to bring you to either a Rapture or to Glory one way or the other that's the only way you're getting out of here and and it really when I look at the world the way it is this morning you know brother random taught numerous messages you know world falling apart and several different messages about it but I was just thinking of the scriptures this morning if you go back to Luke Mark and Matthew and even John where that one thing really strikes me where we said there'll be wars and rumors of wars and he said and he he said that's not just it but there will be rumors of wars and wars and as we look at the Earth this morning every continent has got some type of major or minor war going on this morning people are living and dying in Conflict this morning just lets us know that the hour and the time that we're in as we go into another year kind of got to shake off that complacency that comes on you in the sometimes got to get further in the word of God and get further in Jesus Christ this morning and I was uh there's you know if you were doing the devotionals I hadn't even read scripture I was reading the devotional for this morning and you know brother Brandon was talking about the thing that struck me in life there's two ways you can live your life you can have a relationship or you can run after things two ways you're either going to be one or the other you're always going to be running after things to fill up your soul and your person or you're going to be running after a relationship and that relationship of course is Jesus Christ or you going to be running after everything else to fill up the void in your life and that's the world that we live in this morning and he also talking about the church this morning it either glows or it shines and I believe that our church glows but some Churches out there they just shine they want all the shiny things but they don't want the relationship this morning but I I'll just read this 52nd chapter here this morning and this is what uh Isaiah had to say he said awake and awake and put on thy strength o Zion put on the beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city from hence forth thou shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean you know we all want to have God's garments this morning on us Shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus sayeth the Lord ye have sold yourselves for not and ye shall be redeemed without money so they've been the children of Israel are no different than the world and the church natural out there this morning they they buy and sell themselves for the the wrong thing for he goes on for thus sayith the Lord you have sold yourself I'm rereading the same but the fourth verse for thus saith the Lord God my people went down a four time into Egypt and soured there and the Assyrians oppressed them without cause now therefore what have I hear sayeth the Lord that my people is taken away for not they that rule over them make them to how sayeth the Lord my name continu with every day is blaspheme I'm sorry for going up and down in this mic therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in the day that I am he both do speak and behold it is I and I I'm getting to the end of the chapter a lot goes on at the end of this 52nd chapter how how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that bringeth good tidings that publish peace and bring Good Tidings of good and publish salvation saith unto Zion God reth and that's no different today this morning and the Watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together they shall sing for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion and you you like brother Brown said you got to see yourself in the scriptures this morning Break Forth into Joy sing together you waste places of Jerusalem for the Lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed Jerusalem the Lord hath made bear his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the Earth shall see the salvation of our God and what I was thinking about this morning as you read the gospels this morning and you think of the church World in their day which would be the Pharisees the lawyers and the Sadducees the scriptures I'm reading this morning they could recite them for B they could without missing the vowel or a consonant they could for word for word they could recite these scriptures back to the people and yet when Christ was walking the face of the Earth they couldn't see who he really was this morning and we're no different ourselves this morning and he goes on and he salvation of our God depart ye depart ye go out from hence touch not the unclean thing go you out of the midst of her be ye clean that the bear the vessels of the Lord for you shall no go out with haste nor go out by flight for the Lord will go before for you and the god of Israel shall be your reward this and that's no different this morning but these last couple of as you read the 54th chapter you read these last supper scriptures I think to myself you you think of all the religious people in Jesus's day they they couldn't see who he was unless God opened their eyes and we're no different this morning he goes on to say in the 13th verse behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall exalted and be exol and be very high and many were astounded at his at thee his Visage was so Mar more than any man and this speaks to the cross the whole 53rd chapter talks about it also and what I'm thinking this morning is the Jewish people that were on the face of the Earth they could not see scripture actually being fulfilled Before Their Eyes in their very day and the world that we live in this morning is no different this morning morning the very scripture is being fulfilled in the world this morning and most of the world won't realize it until it's over and we don't want to be in that position so it's a it's a a real solemn thought that our very lives our very salvation hends on the fact that we stay firmly in the word of God this morning and I'll just finish these two verses for as many were stoned that his Visage was so marred more than any man his form more than any of the sons of man so the prophet is talking about what Christ was going to suffer this morning he's seen it you know hundreds of years before it actually happened and he goes on so they shall sprinkle many nations so shall he sprinkle many nations the Kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which have not been told them they shall see that which they have heard they shall consider I was going to read out of Colossians the uh third chapter this morning but I guess the thing I was really simply W as we go into another year as you as I think of I can only think of myself this morning anything you know as I get older I've said before all the things that I might have wanted to accomplish when I was in my 20s and 30s even if I accomplished them and I some of them I think I did they don't mean anything anymore the only thing that I've ever accomplished that'll ever mean anything is my relationship with Jesus Christ this morning and as we go as I go into another year that I know that the scripture tells me that that has to be mean more to me tomorrow than it not meant to me today that's the way I have to live my life the only thing that matters for me as a person or as a Christian is the word of God and what God is doing for me in my life and uh and I can only sa from my own life the last year it's it's easy to get clouded over with running after things that really don't matter but as I get older I realize the only thing that matters is a relationship with Jesus Christ and anything that's going to hinder that you just got to let it fall by the wayside Brother David love the Lord this morning amen let's stand if we could and sing that chorus All My Hope Is In Jesus this morning amen is that where your hope is this morning amen and All My Hope Is In Jesus oh thank God my y days gone and oh my sins are forgiven oh I been washed by once more this morning if we could and All My Hope Is In Jesus oh thank God my yesterday's God and all my sins are forgien oh I been washed by

help me to get out of the way Lord and use the gift of God lord to minister the word to the people that truly we could go from here Lord Jesus with the same testimony as those disciples did on their road to emus did not a heart burn within us as he spoke to us along the way thank you for still speaking to your people God and we ask Lord Jesus you would speak this morning now father be with all those again Lord that have needs those that have need of a touch of a healing father and we want to give you praise and honor and glory for those you have healed Lord Jesus we ask now father as we open this Bible that you would speak the words out of it and give us the inspiration of it from it Lord in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord amen I felt like since this is the last service that we will have in 2024 amen and we uh In the Flesh are still in time isn't that right we're still in time but I believe a prophet taught us that we're in eternity in our Spirits ain't that right and even Paul talked about he says You observe days and times and seasons and all that I'm afraid of you at least I have bestowed labor upon you in vain amen but I do want to speak to you this morning on actually I want to try the take these two titles Amen to and tie them together amen the God of all Grace and we'll call it new beginnings new beginnings praise be to God amen so may God add His blessings to the reading of the word let's turn to I believe it's Zachariah all the way back in Zachariah if you will the first chapter Zachariah 1 brother Brandon used this scripture to preach the message of Grace message of Grace amen praise be to God I think it was Yan's brothers that put together a song Amen and he they had in that song Amen the spiritual amen How does it go anymore amen and the message of Grace and Lord I Thank thee and I Just Want to Thank You Lord amen for the message of Grace praise the Lord but in Zechariah one I believe it is and no I'm not sorry I'm sorry not one but four Zechariah 4 verse one and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that wenth out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and the Seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and the two olive trees by it amen one upon the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side of the bowl amen and I so I answered and spake to the angel to talk with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said nay my Lord and he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain for zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen over in First Peter First Peter 1 I'm sorry not First Peter 1 but it's first Peter 5 1 Peter 5 and verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary to devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom res resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ Jesus after that you have for the while make you perfect establish strength and settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and forever amen you can be seated this morning that's where I got that first title amen of the God of all Grace amen the God of all Grace amen we want to speak a little bit about New Beginnings amen it's quite something how that uh God has fixed it in our lives so that Within then every 24 hours it's something new ain't that right every 24 hours is a new beginning isn't that right amen every day we wake up we work we eat our supper we go back to bed we sleep we wake up and we do this every 24 hours amen so every day amen is a new day and then you've got your weeks isn't that right every week it Cycles over Cycles over every month Cycles over Cycles over every 30 days every seven days every 30 days or 31 or whatever 28 sometimes is that right but every month and then every year we come to oh my we come to uh what what will it be on on Tuesday night that right how the fireworks will burst how people will celebrate you know and how they'll celebrate a new New Year we call it a happy New Year it's a new beginning many people will turn over Pages people will make commitments people will make promises that'll last for a few hours anyway maybe and some of them might last a week some of them maybe last a month amen but the bad part is you know you can't change your Nature by simple thought of your mind or by writing a dedication in a book no it takes more than that Amen to overcome smoking drinking or whatever it might be that people want to overcome it takes more than that now I'm here to tell you I'm glad that is God is the god of new beginnings he is the god of Second Chances and not just of Second Chances but of third chances and of fourth chances and of fifth chances amen because see God is a god of Grace how many believe he is a god of of all Grace I mean when you look at God you are looking at Grace unlike what you have ever imagined and I want to tap into that for just a few minutes with our minds let's tap into the almighty grace of God think of it that God is so gracious he is so full of grace and he is amen and love and grace brother bam said was twin sisters he said there the same thing you can't have Grace without having love amen when remember this when somebody's talking bad about somebody or condemning somebody for this that's not Grace that's not love no that's not compassion that's not being merciful that's being unmerciful judgmental amen and the Bible says with whatever measure you might it shall be measured to you again and the Bible says blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy how many believes this morning we need to be a people of Grace we need to people be a people of [Applause] Mercy amen I don't know about you but I don't want to be on the receiving end of a judgmental attitude if you don't have mercy for people God will not have mercy for you he will make it very hard that is a promise of God it's a law in the Bible hallelujah how many know this God that we've been talking about here the last couple of months that was before time amen the self-existing one the one thing that he is he is the very essence of Grace he is the very essence of love God is so full of love God is so full of grace until guess what the whole of humanity owed him a debt that they could not pay and what did he do millions of dollars were so to speak and he forgave all their debt he forgave the whole world of all of their debt he would have forgiven Cain of his debt Ain that right if he had just went and offered the lamb like his brother did see God so loved the world that if his only that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe with him should not perish but have everlasting life amen came to forgive every sin that was ever done how many knows that when he died on Calvary he forgave every sin that was ever committed or ever will be committed he forgave it all that is a god of Grace amen the only reason that you won't get it because you don't want it you won't accept it amen because a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon just think about it Brad Brother Brad all of that we don't have to pay for it but if we don't accept his grace every thought that you ever had that was wrong you got to pay for it there's what hell's going to be be a long time I can't imagine how long Hitler's going to be in hell can you imagine how long that man's going to be in Hell he's going to be in there for a very long time that's right because of all that he did it's all got to be paid for I'm just glad that it's paid for it for you tonight amen that's right on Judgment Day oh man I'm here to tell you judgment's going to there be going something else I wonder oh my brother Brad I wonder how long it will take I wonder how long judgment will take I don't know that the Bible says how long it'll take but at the end of the Thousand Years everybody gets called up God says come on the sea gave up the Dead everything gave up the dead it don't matter what you were it calls everybody hell death the grave everything come on up stand before me and in Box Car siiz letters or whatever brother said it'll be showed you everything you ever did the color of your clothes you was where what you were doing the motive of your heart when you was lying to somebody the very motive of what you said and why you said it it'll be brought out the secrets of men's Hearts will be made known on that day Jesus said amen that's right but the word says that if you're in Jesus there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus there is no judgment for those that are in Christ cuz Jesus took your judgment and paid the price on Calvary you oh here's a new revelation brother bad we have prepaid our sins are prepaid Glory don't you like that it's already taken care of before we ever get there and that's why you ask me why I'm happy so I might as well tell you why because my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me how about you it's good enough for you that's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone that's grace Amazing [Applause] Grace brother bam talks about the great message of Grace is rub when this great Prince comes when them headstone comes he says when this headstone comes the Capstone how many know you and I are living in the Capstone age with a Capstone message amen and in this Capstone message it it's Grace Grace Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the richet like me Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer all of them Liars up there huh so bad a Liars our politicians are that if they say something you better believe the opposite huh I've learned that amen they'll say well Republicans are a threat to democracy tell me who really is a threat to democracy huh anyway let's not get Pol itical but see what I'm trying to say is you're not getting away with anything ain't nobody getting away with anything we don't want to get nothing we don't want to try to get away with nothing so therefore if we're not trying to get away with from with nothing where do we go we go to church we go to church amen and hopefully you got a man of God Amen that'll preach the truth they'll step on your toes because judgment begins at the house of God and some men sins and judgments go up beforehand that's why we got an altar say God I'm guilty of what that preacher said I'm guilty of all things and God I confess and I Repent Lord and Lord I pray God you'll forgive me amen you better come to the other you better be judged while there's still Mercy for you while there's still Grace for you cuz right now the judge that will be is now your attorney and he's pleading your case and saying no I paid for his sin look at there he's confessing them they're in the sea of his forgetfulness now they're gone sure he's guilty but he's forgiven because he repents that's great so we come to church if you don't like to have your toes stepped on sometimes amen like if doesn't bother you not to go to church you'll just miss for any old reason when the word of God says if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open if they're open you want to be there and if not the prophet said you better get to pray cuz your heart's desires in the wrong place you ain't where you ought to be amen Lord we want to be where we want to be we want to be where God wants us to be this is a Capstone headstone message and it's crying Grace Grace amen how many know it's double Grace for the prde of Jesus Christ double grace Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the Wretch like Me amen hallelujah praise the Lord I believe it's in Galatians may not even have wrote it down here but I'm going to find it here if I didn't let me see if I can find it how many thankful for the Amazing Grace of Jesus Christ amen because it's simply a it's amazing brother brandom tied it in with the love of God Amen could we with ink the ocean fill amen we're disguise of parchment made with every stalk on earth a quill and every man A Tribe by a a scribe by trade to love of to write the love of God would drain the ocean dry amen would drain the ocean dry the love of God praise the Lord amen amen all right I should know where this is I think it's in Galatians yes here it is Galatians 2 amen for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God woo how many know it wasn't something that you done it wasn't because of your works but it was God's Sovereign Grace his divine grace is what saves us now oh how we know that we needed a new birth we needed a new beginning why because we had an old coat on and old Cod on the old man with his nature just couldn't get away from it no matter how many committal we made no how many leaves we turned just couldn't do it didn't have the power to do it but we needed a nature change we needed something new amen we need a new testament with his new blood to give us a new birth by his grace read listen to that message message of Grace he says you can't bargain for it you can't make a deal with God for it no and you don't have it because you have a gift even brother Braham said of ministering or being a prophet or speaking in tongues or having faith to move Mountain that's not what gets it to you it's simply God sovereign he makes a point that it's Sovereign Grace God is a sovereign God but says he does what he wants to when he wants to he don't ask nobody you know President Biden he pardoned all of these people that did such horrible things that they were on death row fixing to be killed that right I don't even know the extent of his pardon I would hope that he just kept them from dying surely he didn't let them guys out but it'd be understandable if they did they did worse stuff than that already they let a millions of them come in here kill us huh but think about it on death row ain't nothing Trump can do ain't nothing you can do ain't nothing nobody can do how about that family that one family they didn't like it at all that their child got killed their mom got killed and their daughter and their baby got got killed and he's pardoning them but that's the power of a president that's the kind of power that he has that's pardoning power and it may be seem bad to them but when you think about you and I were deserving of death you and I were on death row and The Sovereign God pardoned you and I thank you Jesus that's Sovereign don't have to ask nobody God does what he wants but you know I'm thankful that God didn't just pardon you so you could go to it again God gives you new begins he forgives you amen so that the next time you'll overcome what you the old thing that you had amen we don't want to do that no more amen he makes a new hard in this he knows how he knows who to pardon amen oh man I'm so thankful for that praise be to God talking about judgment again I love how many loves the story of those those wagon train going out west got on this long prair full of weeds and grass hide dead I mean you talk about burn like a wildfire right and there was a fire Big Smoke Fire coming in their way they were scared and there was a smart man among them I like a smart man there is a smart man among them because my smart man is this guy right here it's the Lord Jesus Christ he's say wisest of all he's the Fountain of all wisdom and we we were fixed to have to go to judgment we were fixed to get burnt in hell he made a way like I said last Sunday if you go to hell it's because you want to huh if you're still a sinner it's because you still want to be a sinner no I don't brother B no I don't I just can't help it yes you can don't give me that somewhere down in there you like your ways you're not willing to part with your ways cuz if you really want to how many knows this is real this works God will forgive God will change it's you it's not him don't you dare blame God it's you it's me it's not him when he cried it's finished I want you to know it's still finished it's done he did his part now our part now it's our turn and you will spend eternity pending on what you choice you make of what you want to do amen God grants Mercy to those who desire it amen remember blind Barnabas he wanted Mercy thou son of David have mercy on me have mercy on me and God had mercy on me I thankful for that God is Rich to all those who call upon Him amen amen praise be to God for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works least any man should boast for we are his workmanship how many believe that when the Holy Spirit comes in you become a new creation oh I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man old things have passed away behold all things have become now how many's living man the day that you got born again you didn't have to worry about the next year or the next year going to change you no that new birth changed you you're a brand new man now and you'll always be a brand new man through all of eternity you'll be a brand new man amen I like that we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had afor ordained that we should walk in them amen praise be to God blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings things in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we've all been in a church where there's a lot of stress and strife it's so thick you can feel the air hey I'm standing up here and I'm here to tell you I helped cause it that's right let's not go back right but the thing of it is the reason I say it is because aren't you glad that we're not living in those typ of times anymore we're in Heavenly places when we come to church we don't want stress and all of that we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where anything is possible where the spirit has freedom to amen have his way cuz brother B says there's Holy Spirit doesn't dwell in all of that God ain't in all of that he leaves the church when there's stress and fussing and bickering fighting he leaves you push him out of the church amen that's free I didn't have that in the script but he did amen praise be to God that's right his workmanship blessed us in Heavenly places amen and what did this message teach us that if you're ever going to make it you have already made it in God's mind you've already made it and you wasn't saved on any certain day matter of fact you were saved from the foundation of the world in the mind of God God knew what you would want he knew that he would deposit something into your heart and that something would have a desire like brother Joe pre amen prayed say thank you Lord for a desire maybe he don't even feel good they got a desire to be in the house of God oh God give more people a desire to be in the house of God and to worship him when they get there to praise him and to glorify him cuz he's worthy of Praise I love to praise God in my car I like to praise him whenever I can but when we come here folks it's here to praise God we're here to worship God in spirit and in truth we're here to bring an atmosphere down we're here to bring Jesus Christ down to our atmosphere that's what we come [Applause] for not here some man some fancy man spring a fancy sermon no amen it's to be led by the Holy Ghost only five deep breaths that little run out to dve High backs helping me a little bit you love him oh I love the the Lord don't you oh man you just we just don't realize like Brother Brad said we can't lose there's no losing for a Christian no we're winners I was thinking this morning how everything about the devil is to tear down the Devil is a Down God Is a upper to lift up the feeble hands Amen to bring up the Deep Mar clay the Sinners out of the deep myy clay to set our feet upon a rock this day the devil wants to kill steal Rob bring you down destroy you amen take your joy from you to get you down in the Wally rub so to speak the wall you wsy Wes Amen to feel you to make you depressed to take you down take your joy away from you take your wayen amen away from you take your praise the Lord away from you to destroy you destroy families destroy relationships destroy churches take it all down but God comes to lift you up to men you to heal you to reconcile you to give you power not to make you powerless but to give you power over the enemy give you power over the flesh I'm thankful he does that all by Grace it's all because of his grace so back to my thought as I say the message of the hour this headstone Capstone message cries grace and grace amen and the prophet said you know if you ever made it you already made it why where's the scripture he says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen oh my I don't know sometimes we let those things get become yeah I've heard that so much brother BL H come on people it should never get old to us to know that God had you in his mind before the foundation of the world that he wrote your name down and if you're in church and you're saved and you're filled with the Holy Ghost but B and you always was with God that Holy Ghost in you that change of life shows you who you are Who I Am Lord who I am I can see now who I am a part of my savior a part of his word it's a revelation it's predestination of who I am W devil get on down the road oh depression Get on Down the Road I'm hurting Plumbing my backbone I need a new body to be able to preach this amen it's good isn't God good amen if we praise God in 2024 we're going to say like David said to Michael his wife oh you dance like a one of the vain guys one of the foolish ones you know you just he says you think that was bad you watch me tomorrow you ain't seen nothing yet we're going to praise him more in 2025 then we did in 2024 we're going to glorify him we're going to live for him we're going to surrender to him we're going to let him lead us and gu

makes him get smaller we should have brother John we should have to ask have you got one of them big old magnifying glasses cuz I boot him so bad back until guess what he's down in this rug and I can't see him unless I got a micr scope that's what we need to do the devil's so far out of our life depression so far out of our life I don't even know where he's at I can't see him nowhere I don't feel him nowhere I don't feel bit of it on me [Applause] oh my I don't know what they made that they didn't made it for John Wesley and this not meant for a preacher but anyway here we go oh we're so

throw the biggest devil after you sores you throw your goliaths at us you throw cancers at us you will not scare us you will not cause us to fear you will not bring us down to your level of depression amen and sadness you have your sadness and your depression and your emptiness and your condemnation and your sin all to yourself we don't want no part of [Music] [Applause] it amen cuz this is a work of Grace we are derived I'm looking that derance I guess it's called those who have derived from the grace of almighty God we are here in this building of all the places in Elon and everywhere we are in this building worshiping God because of the grace of almighty God we are here to give thanks back to him for what he has given us freely and no cost to us but to receive it and accept it that's why we're here amen just comes to mind I believe brother Bram said used to be people didn't even want to look at me go down the street and they'd go somewhere else he'd say Howdy and they wouldn't say howdy Ain that right he's one of them brandom name had family B name had a bad name amen long for the day that he could have a 22 and maybe shoot a little bit of this that and the other and give make a little money a't that right he says now I got to go hide I got so many friends knocking on my door I got the walls plastered with guns and is it because of no it's because of the grace of almighty God everything you have is because of the grace of almighty God 2024 has been the grace of almighty God 2025 will be the grace of Almighty God we will live by [Applause] grace and in his grace we will need to live amen praise be the Lord God is good we serve he who is the beginning ain't that right he is the beginning of anything new he is the beginning of the creation of God we are an extension of that creation of God God is building a group of people to fill that New Jerusalem we are the spiritual New Jerusalem amen all by his grace amen he is the beginning he is the ending praise the Lord how many believes he's your beginning he's your ending he controls your beginning he controls your End Amen what was he said to Isaiah one of them before you was formed in your mother's womb I knew you how many know before you was formed in the womb God knew you and he chose you to live the first time and that was Grace but double Grace is when he called you when he play place that seed on the inside of you that germ of God that without that germ you don't care nothing about God or the church huh not really how many knows that there's Millions out there acting like they care about God acting like they love God they go to church just to appease their conscience I will say this that if a person truly loves the Lord Jesus Christ they will belov they will believe and love the message sent to our generation you can't reject that and say I love God cuz he sent it it's a part of him just like any other part of the word of God is the word of God Amen now praise the Lord I love to use my tongue I love to use my voice my energy my sweat to serve and to worship my God why because I know that before I was formed God knew me I know that he formed me in my mother's womb I know that he is my beginning he oh my the Bible says being confident Philippian Philippians 1 and6 being confident of this one thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he started it he's got to finished it we don't know what 20 25 holds but he know the one holds it and we know the one that holds you we don't know what catastrophes lays ahead this one thing we do know the prophet prophesied that there is only judgment ahead for America ain't no preacher can preach blessings upon America cuz what God has cursed is cursed amen when he pronounced judgment upon it judgment has come upon it but Abraham didn't even pray for it why do you waste your breath when God said it's beyond coming back way back in 56 and 57 it was beyond coming back we might think that oh we're going to make Great America great again and I don't think most of the people here are probably glad for who's in this but if you think it's going to be made great again I don't say it can't be made a little better huh but it's 38 trillion dollars in debt huh you can't even pay the interest on that stuff done but I'm glad that in the midst of all of that knowing that heaven and Earth shall pass away we look for a new Heaven and a new Earth how many believe that I might as well go to right to it since I brought it up be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord It's a thousand years 1,00 years is one day and the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slackness but his longsuffering has a lot of Grace to us work not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth and all the works therein shall be burnt up how many knows but man parallel the Earth being burned up amen as your a type of your new beginning when the fire of the Holy Ghost come into your heart he burns out all the cross he burns out all the sin and all the Devils they all get burned and it's a new Heaven A New Earth so to speak amen it's a new world it's a new world being born again is a new world I got born again at 20 years old 62 now now I'm here to tell you it's a whole new world I like it because I like what brother B says you know this grace is sovereignly given God chooses who he wants to give it to and he gives it to you nobody has any say so say in it some people maybe want to try to put you out say no you're not you're not just shut up God does the choosing not you amen aren't you glad for that praise be to God oh a new heavens and a new Earth seeing then all these things shall be dissolved what Manner persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for the Hasting unto the coming of the day of God where in the heavens shall being on fire shall be off and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new Earth I speak that loudly and we've heard it loudly brother Daniel brother Paul we've heard it the Heaven and Earth there'll be a new Heaven and the new Earth Earth but boy I'm here to tell you ticktock ticktock every tick get just one tick closer to when it's going to get manifest because he's not slack concerning his promise if he promised that we was going to be on a new Heaven and a new Earth if he promised a body change a Rapture and most important importantly brother I'm believing it's going to be me I'm believing it's going to be you and you and you can I have a little bunch of Faith well not really all that much not even all that hard to have but I've got faith in all of you are going to be in that Rapture all of us are going to be there we all plan on being there with all of our hearts Lord not just me and not just you but all of us wouldn't it be nice if happened in the next few seconds all of a sudden we just feel a Sweep come [Music] that come in and change feel a tinkling in your body maybe Ram said did he say a little sharp pain I'm thinking he might have said something of a little sharp pain or something or something might not have but it just seems like he did but just boom all of a sudden you look down wrinkles ain't there no more it's perfectly smooth where where's the mirror where's the mirror I don't look in the mirror ain't that right we all be looking for a mirror probably won't have to why because we'll feel it I'll tell you what when I leap I want to just kind of go up there about 10 feet I want to touch the ceiling you know and come back down and oh this is a brand new body walk right through this Pulpit that's right boy but B you're fantasizing you're a little crazy yeah maybe so leave me this way I feel better about it this way than I did the other that's fantasy this is fantasy and it's not fantasy it's reality it's the truth there's nothing more silent on the face of the Earth than this right here you can Bank on it I'm planning on it I'm living by it for it looking forward to it our body change got a few hours left I guess maybe a day or two Tuesday night midnight is that right got till Tuesday night midnight for it to happen in 24 even so Lord come come before 25 is okay with me how many is with me be all right with me but if you don't come in 24 I'll be looking for him in 25 amen can I say a few more things kind of on a personal note amen Jesus said to Peter after Peter asked him if my brother trespassed me against me seven times in the day am I supposed to forgive him how many times am I supposed to forgive my brother seven times remember this David did not have much grace on the man that took that other man's sheep and killed it and sacrific at did he when he took Beth Sheba and I believe it was Samuel was it n Samuel or Nathan Samuel came to him he says he give him the story and David said men not only will he restore but he will pay with his life he didn't have much grace for him did he Samuel says David you're the man you're the man David thought that he could get away with amen folks let me just say this as it comes you might hide it from me you might hide it from your husband or your wife nobody else might know anything about it but know this you better get it right because God knows God knows that's why our hearts has to be and our conscience has to be pure David should have known but brother B in this message called Grace he says but God had Grace on David he had mercy on him even though you pronounce that God's not going to kill you he had many troubles because of it but even then how many knows David needed a new start after his wives were raage after Absalon was dead after after all the catastrophe God restored him and that he needed to do start and so many times even we as Christians maybe you backslide maybe you get away from God and sometimes you need a new start maybe there's somebody in here this morning really needs a new start and he's the God of all Grace Peter wanted to forgive him seven times Jesus said no but seven times seven in a day if he repents you to forgive him 490 times a day I'm here to tell you sometimes people are not very forgiving of each other we're not very forgiving each other not near like God is we're not humans of all Grace we kind of reach our limits don't we then we go to fing that's enough I can't take it no more no 470 times that's how gracious God is how many times brother baham said if it wasn't for the grace of God none of us would be here that's what he even said the mistakes the prophets made the mistakes you make the mistakes that I made but one thing about this brothers and sisters as we come into this new year is we are not looking back we're not looking at our mistakes our failes and all of that we're looking at pressing towards to mark for the prize of the high calling in Jesus Christ we're pressing forward amen midlife crisis how many's heard of midlife crisis I know what a midlife crisis is absolutely something comes on you you really didn't expect didn't see it coming and it could be anything brother Troy had a crisis and sister Robin that was a crisis with that fever T what was called limes disease yes never forget it turmoil that brother Troy was in let me tell you something I pray you don't I pray that our marriage couples or marriages and everything I hope you don't have a midlife crisis let me let me just give you you married couples a little marital advice be careful after you've lived together so many years you become so common sometimes you become so common that you really kind of fall out of love with your partner a lot of people just want somebody else they just don't want to be with their maid anymore you got to watch that you got to be very careful of that amen so many divorces happen after 20 30 40 years so you make sure that you rekindle if you've gotten away from it you rekindle that flame between you and your mate amen that she's special he's special what do you want honey the Bible says a husband seeks how he may please his wife his wife seeks how she may please her husband see folks as long as you're trying to be pleasing to each other and making each other happy it's a happy happy life amen but time sometimes it can be other things just other things that come along that create a crisis that you don't realize amen this church went through a midlife crisis this church experienced a midlife midlife crisis it went through the Hall of critics huh I don't I don't want to open any wounds but I'm going to give this and say this to the honor and glory of God God there's a lot of people and people's even prophesied this place would be shut down prophesied shut down at least that's what I was told hello is it shut down no we went through some real serious amen just a small group until even I become I don't know what the word would be discouraged discouraged and the Lord knows it's it's just the Lord the Lord knows how I felt the Lord knows what we was going through and the Lord turned it around the Lord did not me not anybody else it's he gets the credit for his grace he turned it around he gave us a new start and I believe that this church is stronger than ever we may not be the greatest number I don't look for numbers I look for Holy Ghost filled people I want us all at Ephesians church maybe not 15 or whatever whatever God seems to put in there but full of the Holy Ghost full of the love of God the devil and all his imps and all evil out of here God we had a new start we had a new beginning I forget how many years ago that was probably around 15 I think right around 15 years when I was here we went through that midlife and we've been here and I remember thinking this when we was going through it I felt like we were down I felt like the enemy was at 50 and we were at 14 we was way down we looked like we were defeated I felt like it was defeated but something in my heart told me that we're only at halftime this is just half [Laughter] time I'm weak I'm down we're down I'm weak but I felt like wait guess what when God gives me strength again when God gives us strength again we're going to come back and we're going to win GL how many knows that we beat the devil God defeated the devil through you and through me that's right said I people encouraging me to quit encouraging me to quit amen and I'm here to tell you something if the Lord would have spoke to my heart says you need to quit now if he' said it I'd have quit it like that I to quit but what do you do when you just have nothing in there that says you're to quit you keep going on it don't matter how down you are it doesn't matter how depressed you are doesn't matter what things look like I hope this is a lesson for us all this morning this was not on the script other than the little bit of midlife crisis but some of this I just feel led by the spirit to say it because I believe it brings honor and glory to Jesus Christ not me or anybody else but you got to do what your Holy Spirit tells you to do like brother Brian says we don't follow man just because somebody tells you something amen Amen brother Glenn I think you can take this but I'm going to say something brother Glenn said something he thought he had a special for me and Donna maybe for us to sing with this all that was happening he says and I think it was the lady that sang God don't move this mountain I may gay weaker every time me and my wife talked about it back there I says and I says honey what do you feel on that and we were like no no we're not going to sing God don't move this mountain this is one mountain we W moved amen amen we don't well welcome you know it's going to make us stronger but we don't say don't move it we going to move it it's going to have to go speak to the mountain and it'll be moveed that's why we never sang it brother Glenn didn't have the feeling on it amen sister Becky same way with the book I hope you don't mind brought a book about people who have diagnosed with cancer diagnosed with cancer and it was no doubt a book of healing
