[29:21] amen amen do you believe in this evening
[29:25] hey man you may have your seats this
[29:28] evening
[29:29] um I want to read a testimony
[29:31] um for my mom before we sing the next
[29:33] song
[29:34] um it's a bit of a lengthy read but I
[29:36] texted some of the brothers last night
[29:37] that my mom had gone into surgery
[29:40] um she's been dealing with a tumor and
[29:42] her
[29:43] somewhere in her stomach area for about
[29:45] eight years now
[29:47] and she had surgery on it in 2015 but
[29:50] they didn't take out the whole thing and
[29:51] then it grew bigger so she finally after
[29:54] years of battling with insurance and
[29:57] different stuff like that she finally
[29:59] got a surgery in California yesterday
[30:01] with two Specialists um but there's just
[30:04] a lot of complications going into it and
[30:07] um she was just praying for certain
[30:08] things she didn't want to get taken out
[30:10] and different stuff but I just wanted to
[30:12] read what she texted us today and we've
[30:14] been praying for a long time just want
[30:15] to thank everyone for their prayers
[30:17] um and she had been praying that she
[30:19] wouldn't need a blood transfer
[30:21] um and just a lot of really specific
[30:24] stuff but anyway she my dad texted last
[30:27] night the surgery is over uh the tumor
[30:29] was non-cancerous no blood transfusions
[30:31] were needed and there is very little
[30:33] blood loss
[30:35] um and then my mom texted me this
[30:36] morning uh good news everyone I get to
[30:39] go home today Dr kivnick came in at 6 30
[30:42] this morning to check things out
[30:43] everything looks good I mean hardly any
[30:46] pain I'm up and down on my own using the
[30:48] restroom and drinking fluids he talked
[30:50] about my surgery and that it all went
[30:51] well he said it was just perfect
[30:53] basically I'm trying to think the word
[30:55] he used but I can't remember right now
[30:56] but it was perfect the tumor was not
[30:58] glued to anything else just as we had
[31:00] asked and prayed it was behind my colon
[31:02] he said it was a very unusual placement
[31:04] for him and of course that pushed
[31:05] everything out she had been looking like
[31:08] she was about nine months pregnant the
[31:10] tumor had pushed so far out
[31:12] and people were actually asking her when
[31:16] the baby was due but anyways
[31:18] um she said
[31:20] uh it came up to just with my belly
[31:23] button he said once they removed it
[31:24] everything fell right back into place
[31:25] where it belongs I said they did not
[31:27] injure anything while they were in there
[31:29] praise God what a great God we serve Dr
[31:32] kivnick after all these years of doing
[31:33] this and he's scratching his head on
[31:35] this one that's our God so I came in
[31:38] [Applause]
[31:42] hey man so we want to thank you all for
[31:43] all of your prayers our families very
[31:45] thankful and if you could continue to
[31:46] remember her she'll be in California

[44:07] Mother's Day amen
[44:10] and so praise the Lord God is good isn't
[44:13] he
[44:14] amen
[44:17] amen I can't think of any announcements
[44:19] or anything so let's just bow our heads
[44:22] and go into the word Lord Jesus we come
[44:24] before you father tonight Lord we're
[44:25] thankful once again to assemble
[44:27] ourselves together knowing Lord that
[44:29] wherever two or three are gathered you
[44:30] promised there you'd be in our midst
[44:32] Lord and certainly we feel your presence
[44:34] here tonight Lord and your children and
[44:35] your people father and we appreciate you
[44:37] Lord Jesus and we want to just talk
[44:39] about you and and brag on you so to
[44:42] speak father and lift you up magnify you
[44:44] Lord and for that's the only thing that
[44:46] there is to look at Lord that's the only
[44:48] thing that's admirable is you Lord and
[44:50] we ask God that you'll bless the
[44:52] meditation of our heart father the
[44:54] message I feel you've laid on my heart
[44:56] to speak tonight we ask God did you just
[44:58] give us an anointing Lord and blessed in
[45:00] the way that you want to bless it and
[45:02] speak the words that you want to speak
[45:03] father you know all the needs that's
[45:05] represented here Lord and we lift them
[45:08] up before you Lord and we ask God that
[45:10] you meet and you'd supply all those
[45:12] needs according to your riches amen we
[45:15] ask these blessings and favors in Jesus
[45:17] name
[45:17] amen and amen kind of a different
[45:20] thought this morning I mean this evening
[45:22] it's not really different it's certainly
[45:24] something we've spoken on before amen
[45:27] but it was just uh maybe just a little
[45:30] different direction maybe than what I
[45:32] usually speak on it amen and so I don't
[45:36] know if y'all have looked at the title
[45:38] amen already we gave it early this time
[45:40] amen
[45:42] you think about giving a an early title
[45:45] in my
[45:46] number
[45:49] you have a dual effect but hopefully it
[45:51] doesn't have an ideal effect with us and
[45:52] they're right we're coming whether we
[45:54] like it or not isn't that right so
[45:56] praise the Lord God bless you amen
[45:58] amen so praise the Lord if you will turn
[46:01] your Bibles amen God's family unit
[46:05] is what I want to speak on tonight God's
[46:08] family unit amen and we want to talk
[46:12] about the family of God I mean it's glad
[46:14] to be part of the family of God Amen
[46:19] over in Genesis let's go to Genesis
[46:21] we'll just start and this is such depth
[46:25] as I begin to look at it that I realize
[46:28] that uh it'll just take the Lord to help
[46:31] me to try to get this thing halfway you
[46:33] know however the Lord wants to lay it
[46:34] out because there's so much in it amen
[46:37] and so much could be brought out but
[46:39] we'll just I mean start somewhere and
[46:41] see what the Lord will have for us amen
[46:44] um
[46:45] in basically what we want to speak on we
[46:48] want to talk a little bit about the
[46:49] attributes you mean God's attributes as
[46:52] a father
[46:53] as a husband
[46:55] amen a mother
[46:57] a brother a sister and a friend
[47:01] so that's a lot of covering there isn't
[47:03] it amen like the song says he's
[47:06] everything he's everything to me he's my
[47:08] father my mother and my sister and my
[47:10] brother he's everything to us amen we
[47:13] want to try to dwell on that but we're
[47:15] going to pull in amen some of these
[47:17] other things also while we're at it amen
[47:19] but uh amen and it's always talking
[47:23] about amen amen so let's read Genesis
[47:28] the second chapter I believe it is
[47:32] Genesis 2
[47:38] we're going to start with 18 and then
[47:40] skip down to verse 21. we're not going
[47:43] to go through Adam naming all the
[47:45] creatures but we just want to focus on
[47:48] his help me and the Lord God said it is
[47:51] not good that man should be alone I will
[47:53] make him and help me for him
[47:56] all right down in verse 21 and the Lord
[47:58] God caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[48:01] Adam and he slept and he took one of his
[48:04] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[48:06] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[48:09] had taken from man made he a woman and
[48:13] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[48:15] this is now a bone of my bones Flesh of
[48:18] My Flesh and she shall be called woman
[48:20] because she was taken out of a man
[48:23] therefore shall a man leave his father
[48:25] and his mother and cleave unto his wife
[48:28] and they shall be one flesh amen and
[48:32] they were both naked in the man and his
[48:34] wife and they were not ashamed I want to
[48:36] read another one over in Ephesians
[48:40] over in the book of Ephesians I want to
[48:42] read a very familiar scripture for us
[48:57] all right Ephesians
[49:00] and we'll begin with chapter five
[49:05] and verse
[49:08] 22 down all the way to the end of the
[49:10] chapter wives submit yourselves unto
[49:13] your own husbands as unto the Lord for
[49:15] the husband is the head of the wife even
[49:17] this Christ is the head of the church
[49:19] and he's the savior of the body now
[49:22] notice that he's the savior of the body
[49:25] how many he believes that this husband
[49:27] that we have he's our savior amen it
[49:30] don't matter what we get into as his
[49:32] wife he always delivers us he's always
[49:35] Our Savior amen praise the Lord okay
[49:38] therefore as the church is subject unto
[49:40] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[49:42] husbands and everything husbands love
[49:45] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[49:47] church and gave himself for it that he
[49:50] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[49:51] washing of the Water by the word that he
[49:54] might present it to himself a glorious
[49:55] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[49:57] such thing but that it should be holy
[49:59] and without blemish so ought men to love
[50:02] their own wives as their own bodies he
[50:04] had love with his wife loveth himself
[50:06] amen
[50:08] now let's just think spiritual wise
[50:10] we're reading down here because we know
[50:12] that he's speaking concerning the Christ
[50:14] and the church isn't that right amen
[50:18] so for no man ever yet hated his own
[50:22] flesh but nourishes and cherished it
[50:24] even as the Lord to church for we are
[50:27] members of his body of his flesh and of
[50:29] his bones but his cause shall a man
[50:31] leave his father and mother and shall be
[50:33] joined unto his wife in day two shall be
[50:36] one flesh this is a great mystery but I
[50:38] speak concerning Christ in the church
[50:40] nevertheless let every one of you in
[50:42] particular to love his wife even as
[50:44] himself and the listen and the wife see
[50:46] that she reverence her husband may God
[50:48] add His blessings to the reading of the
[50:50] words you can be seated this evening
[50:53] I do want to
[50:54] um
[50:57] let me see here
[51:07] that's in First Corinthians
[51:10] read one more scripture
[51:13] in when he was talking about a woman
[51:15] shouldn't cut her hair and so forth and
[51:17] in in chapter 11 of First Corinthians he
[51:20] makes a statement but I would have you
[51:22] to know that man is Christ and the head
[51:25] of the woman is the man and the head of
[51:28] Christ is God Amen so we already painted
[51:33] a picture of of what uh God had in his
[51:37] mind at the beginning amen isn't that
[51:40] right amen when he created man when he
[51:43] created a woman and so forth he was a a
[51:45] it was something that God had in his
[51:47] mind amen uh of something further down
[51:51] the road amen so we're talking we're
[51:54] going to talk with the help of the Lord
[51:55] for a little while about marriage amen
[51:57] talking about the family you mean the
[52:00] whole family you know and we already
[52:02] know that uh uh you know the the family
[52:06] is and I didn't pull it up I've totally
[52:09] forgot about that
[52:11] um
[52:14] and I won't do it now but in the church
[52:16] age book you all remember where brother
[52:18] Ben wanted a coach he says now God he
[52:21] said he wanted to be he wanted a family
[52:23] of his own he wanted sons and daughters
[52:25] like himself amen and then he talks
[52:29] about how that he'll be training them
[52:30] sons and daughters and so forth to be in
[52:32] His image and they'll be becoming his
[52:34] very image in order to be United with
[52:36] him and so forth but the point that that
[52:38] wanted to pull out is that God desired a
[52:41] family of his own amen God desired to
[52:46] have a family isn't that right and one
[52:49] of his attributes of course
[52:51] was to be a father but how many knows
[52:53] you can't be a father until you're a
[52:55] husband isn't that right first you
[52:57] become a husband and and so forth you
[52:59] got to be married to have children and
[53:00] so forth amen but now amen we want to
[53:02] talk about the fatherhood we want to
[53:04] talk about God's Providence and so forth
[53:06] with the help of God and what really
[53:08] what really kind of brought me to this
[53:10] is I thought that I've always had and
[53:12] have thought that I've always really
[53:14] really uh enjoyed in the Lord and that
[53:17] is uh God's Providence God's Providence
[53:21] amen amen and so how did God always
[53:25] provides now and I was thinking of on in
[53:29] my own self with my wife with my family
[53:31] and so forth and you can think of it in
[53:32] your family but amen any any time that
[53:35] uh uh you get married and I thought
[53:37] about you know uh you know I'll stop
[53:40] that thought for a minute but let me let
[53:41] me come back and pick this how many
[53:42] knows uh that when uh
[53:46] what's more valuable than a billion
[53:49] dollars what's the most valuable thing
[53:52] that you can have the best thing that
[53:55] you can have outside of salvation
[54:01] amen and I thought you know I thought
[54:03] about Caleb over here you know they
[54:05] don't realize they just found the very
[54:07] bad they could be a billionaires but it
[54:09] wouldn't be as good as what you just
[54:10] found
[54:12] what does it say over there it talks
[54:14] about her fight prices far above rubies
[54:16] and all these other but her band makes a
[54:18] statement he says well your wife and or
[54:20] your husband is a bad thing that you can
[54:22] have outside of salvation
[54:25] I mean no sometimes sometimes we kind of
[54:28] neglect that thought don't we we don't
[54:31] realize how precious our mate is
[54:34] amen now that brings us to the spiritual
[54:37] aspect of it how many knows that more
[54:39] precious than the whole earth more
[54:41] precious than the whole galaxy more
[54:43] precious than anything else in God's
[54:46] eyes is
[54:48] his bride his church
[54:51] you know and we look at this we realize
[54:53] that this is a type now if you really
[54:55] want to get into it we're going to talk
[54:56] about a little bit with the invisible
[54:57] Union of Christ and the bride amen how
[55:00] that brother banham talk about Eve and
[55:02] how that's you uh hoard around and so
[55:04] forth with the serpent and all of this
[55:05] other stuff and and how the whole whole
[55:07] picture of the whole thing is about
[55:10] marriage all right it's about a husband
[55:13] and a wife amen but and he also talks
[55:16] about a wife and the way that she's made
[55:18] how that she's made very particular and
[55:21] in a special way
[55:23] amen
[55:24] oh my praise the Lord
[55:27] oh my now notice Let me just slow down
[55:30] here a little bit first of all he says
[55:32] marriage is the oldest institution in
[55:34] the world
[55:39] oh never instituted
[55:43] was marriage
[55:46] and let me ask you how many knows that
[55:47] you know we already know that strong
[55:50] thing
[55:52] it takes strong families to make
[55:55] anything strong
[55:57] whether it's a community or whether it's
[55:59] a nation Womanhood and motherhood not
[56:01] Womanhood many women out there but
[56:03] motherhood is the very backbone of the
[56:06] nation
[56:08] and so uh you know think about that of
[56:11] how that is the very strength that the
[56:13] institution that God instituted it
[56:14] because he knew that he would be the
[56:16] very strength when you break that you
[56:18] break everything
[56:19] now we're thinking as you study a lot of
[56:21] time you think of how evil people have
[56:23] gotten you know and and and
[56:26] homosexuality lesbianism and all this
[56:28] other stuff why
[56:31] I I guess you know I don't know about
[56:34] you better tell me but if I was wicked
[56:36] and bad and stuff I would just do all
[56:37] kinds of wicked and bad stuff and live
[56:39] with a woman live with her not never no
[56:41] man but listen I would not bother
[56:44] getting married
[56:47] why do they bother getting married
[56:53] it's a mockery it's blast
[56:56] beat me against God they wouldn't even
[56:58] have they're Wicked they're not even the
[57:00] category of having any kind of an
[57:02] honorable marriage
[57:04] it's the oldest institution and named
[57:06] make a mockery out of it I call it
[57:09] blasphemy against God because now God
[57:12] did not make Adam
[57:14] Eve he made Adam and Eve
[57:18] amen and look at it today look at where
[57:20] it's at just I I want to say leave Mary
[57:23] John of it Mary
[57:24] it's just supposed to be holy between
[57:27] one man and one woman holy and
[57:29] completely giving to each other and holy
[57:32] mat that ain't no holy matrimony
[57:35] that's Unholy
[57:38] but it's just blasphemy isn't it
[57:40] it's just making a mockery of it making
[57:43] a mockery of the family
[57:45] and it's gotten really bad isn't it
[57:48] oh my
[57:50] now notice I like this so he says in the
[57:54] woman I know this woman is entrusted
[57:56] with certain characters that she must
[57:58] not defile a woman is trusted with that
[58:01] there's not a creature on earth like a
[58:04] woman
[58:06] foreign
[58:08] now how many knows there's really only
[58:11] two women that the Bible talks about
[58:15] one she's called the great mother Harlot
[58:18] is that right
[58:20] and she's a harlot she's a Abominations
[58:23] of the Earth
[58:25] near Kings of the earth committed
[58:27] fornications with her and all these
[58:29] other things I've got some scriptures
[58:30] wrote down
[58:32] ones of just a filthy prostitute and the
[58:36] other one is the bride that has made
[58:39] herself ready there's two
[58:41] and if you really want to get a good
[58:44] scope of this listen to The Invisible
[58:45] Union but brother Banner brings it out
[58:47] and he brings it out about how in this
[58:49] generation what the churches have done
[58:51] now how many knows it tight now notice
[58:53] the church we know that the church is a
[58:56] type of the bride of Christ
[59:00] amen that's what the church is
[59:03] amen and I like this oh my now listen so
[59:07] we know that God had in mind
[59:12] he wanted the wife
[59:15] he wanted Fellowship he wanted communion
[59:20] isn't that right
[59:22] and oh if the people would have just
[59:24] realized in our day that that's why I
[59:26] said Malachi 4 to vindicate and prove
[59:29] that he's here and saying come on you
[59:31] know the wedding's ready to supper come
[59:33] on everybody who's ever will let him
[59:35] come invited everybody
[59:37] become his wife so to speak
[59:40] but they didn't want to have anything to
[59:42] do with it
[59:43] amen it was actually the love of God
[59:46] amen
[59:49] so
[59:51] first of all we realized that he also
[59:54] wanted to be a husband now just as he
[59:57] opened up the side of Adam and that
[59:59] right and he took out a rib
[1:00:02] oh my how many knows that anything God
[1:00:04] does
[1:00:06] is for a purpose and for a reason
[1:00:08] and others he did not just take flesh
[1:00:12] he didn't just take blood and flesh but
[1:00:14] he took a rip he took bone
[1:00:17] right
[1:00:18] oh I had to think as I was studying this
[1:00:21] I said you know amen somebody might say
[1:00:24] that you're ugly and you might say well
[1:00:26] Beauty's Only Skin Deep
[1:00:29] but you know I want you to understand
[1:00:30] with the bride of Jesus Christ that what
[1:00:34] we have goes all the way to the bow
[1:00:40] first of all if you're gonna be God's
[1:00:43] wife if God's gonna have a life it is
[1:00:46] going to have to be made in a special
[1:00:48] way
[1:00:51] he will never marry a harlot he will
[1:00:53] never marry a prostitute
[1:00:57] he'll never marry a flirt somebody that
[1:01:00] kisses and slops around with the world
[1:01:02] and his bride the church amen a woman is
[1:01:05] a very special vessel
[1:01:07] she is made in a special way
[1:01:14] I mean at least he's made in a special
[1:01:15] way
[1:01:17] there's no female like her there's none
[1:01:20] of them there's none made like him
[1:01:21] there's no dog like that there's no and
[1:01:24] no female of any kind entrusted with the
[1:01:27] character that the woman is a woman
[1:01:30] wasn't even in the beginning the
[1:01:32] original creation because God knowed
[1:01:34] that she would fall all other females
[1:01:36] could commit adultery she's the only one
[1:01:39] that can commit adultery
[1:01:47] every animal just does it for their
[1:01:50] babies at a certain time of the year and
[1:01:52] that's all they do it
[1:01:55] year after year same thing but the woman
[1:01:58] is entrusted and she's able to have it
[1:02:00] no matter how many times and how often
[1:02:03] and with whoever she's made that way
[1:02:06] basically what it is is she's been given
[1:02:08] a free moral agency she can pick right
[1:02:12] or she can pick wrong just like he was
[1:02:14] given a choice to pick right or to pick
[1:02:17] wrong
[1:02:18] she has to open up her mind to receive
[1:02:21] the devil's word
[1:02:23] how many please has the words of the
[1:02:25] Bride of Jesus Christ opens up heart
[1:02:28] opens up her mind to read God's word
[1:02:33] oh my not like that because he says she
[1:02:36] is flesh if my flesh she is bone of my
[1:02:39] bone amen his Bible talks about that we
[1:02:41] are Spirit of his Spirit where blood of
[1:02:43] his blood we're life of his life first
[1:02:46] flash of his flesh we're both
[1:02:50] foreign
[1:02:51] you have got to be made out of God
[1:02:54] himself
[1:02:55] material
[1:02:59] you can't be made out of denomina
[1:03:06] it has got to be broad material and that
[1:03:09] is only come out of the side of Christ
[1:03:11] came what blood and water any Spirit
[1:03:14] come out and you've got to be born of
[1:03:17] his spirit
[1:03:20] you can't be his bride any other way
[1:03:24] ah
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:27] if you notice
[1:03:29] in Romans 7 means where brother Brandon
[1:03:31] went to to preach on the invisible Union
[1:03:34] and he got to talking about how that if
[1:03:36] a woman is married to another man while
[1:03:39] her husband liveth she shall be called
[1:03:42] an adulterous
[1:03:45] and brother bam says if a woman would do
[1:03:47] such a thing she forfeits her rights
[1:03:49] that God in heaven forfeits him right
[1:03:52] stood why because God's not going to
[1:03:55] live with a harlot or an indoctriness
[1:03:59] but that wasn't so much the point that
[1:04:01] he was making it natural he was making
[1:04:03] his point in his spiritual
[1:04:05] amen that the church world what they
[1:04:07] were doing they were they were slopping
[1:04:09] around with the world they were defiling
[1:04:11] themselves they were not keeping their
[1:04:13] virtue their virtue
[1:04:16] going to seminarians believing
[1:04:19] everything a seminar and everybody else
[1:04:21] to teach us over the word of God
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:27] oh my there's certain things that the
[1:04:29] woman because her body is made in a
[1:04:32] special way
[1:04:33] she's the only one that can make
[1:04:36] and commit adultery she's got characters
[1:04:38] that she
[1:04:39] must not defile how many believes that
[1:04:43] the bride of Christ the Church of God
[1:04:45] you've got a character that you can must
[1:04:47] not defy
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:50] her body was given to her but they're
[1:04:52] being obsessed amen a sacred trust from
[1:04:55] God
[1:04:57] no
[1:04:58] no dog no bird no other man no creature
[1:05:01] no she's the only one amen and the
[1:05:04] reason that it's secret oh I like this
[1:05:06] the reason that is sacred how many
[1:05:08] believe that as a Christian and then you
[1:05:10] have a certain uh a responsibility
[1:05:14] keep yourself hurt and I'll tell you why
[1:05:17] why is because that she listen
[1:05:21] the reason it's so sacred is because she
[1:05:23] is
[1:05:25] to bring forth life to the Earth
[1:05:32] [Applause]
[1:05:34] Glory let me know God wants to have sons
[1:05:37] and daughters amen and God does the man
[1:05:39] doesn't have the children the woman has
[1:05:41] the children the wife has the children
[1:05:46] Hallelujah
[1:05:51] and we know what happened in the garden
[1:05:53] of Ed he says how can you not see the
[1:05:54] the adultery in the Garden of Eden she
[1:05:57] had twins one of them was Cain of the
[1:05:59] wicked when the Bible says yes amen
[1:06:03] she was an adulteress
[1:06:05] but she is to bring life into the Earth
[1:06:07] her body is a betting grounds of life
[1:06:14] I may believe that he didn't have to
[1:06:17] sign half life he didn't have not the
[1:06:19] son have not life
[1:06:21] you and I are to bring forth God's
[1:06:24] children we're going to stop there
[1:06:26] because I want to come back to this here
[1:06:27] in a minute but let's first of all talk
[1:06:29] about him as now as a father
[1:06:32] how many knows these are Heavenly Father
[1:06:36] oh my aren't you glad he's my father
[1:06:39] he's my mother he's my sister he's my
[1:06:40] brother
[1:06:42] but he's our heavenly father we as see
[1:06:46] you know Revelations talks about
[1:06:50] seven heads and
[1:06:51] and horns and all these other things you
[1:06:54] know and sometimes it's kind of hard to
[1:06:55] understand but we can be his son
[1:06:58] we can also be his wife
[1:07:01] huh
[1:07:02] it may sound weird but it's not
[1:07:04] it's just a twofold thing you can deal
[1:07:06] with you as a child amen
[1:07:09] now let's look at this for a minute I
[1:07:11] wanna I wanna go ahead of this other for
[1:07:13] a minute let's talk about him dealing
[1:07:14] now when he becomes a father amen our
[1:07:17] heavenly father as a father
[1:07:20] husband father all right
[1:07:23] amen the man I read that in the
[1:07:26] scripture where it says the man is the
[1:07:28] head of the wife
[1:07:30] the man is the head of the house there's
[1:07:32] only one over the man and that's Christ
[1:07:34] isn't that right
[1:07:37] oh my what do you think about what
[1:07:40] everything how many know that whenever a
[1:07:41] family is running smooth ain't it nice
[1:07:45] Isn't it nice when the family is just
[1:07:47] running smooth
[1:07:48] husband and wife get along with two kids
[1:07:50] have happened
[1:07:56] but isn't it terrible
[1:07:58] huh when they're not getting along
[1:08:02] huh that's right you know you don't
[1:08:04] always get along you have disputes this
[1:08:06] out of the other
[1:08:10] not me meant for it to run smoothly it
[1:08:13] doesn't always but you gotta get iron
[1:08:15] things out like that
[1:08:17] but the responsible let's first off
[1:08:19] think about the husband father and the
[1:08:21] responsibility that comes with a husband
[1:08:24] or a father he is the head of it and I
[1:08:28] don't care what part of the family I
[1:08:30] don't care if it's just finances I don't
[1:08:31] care if it's uh emotions I don't care if
[1:08:34] it's your wife or no uh what kind of
[1:08:36] feeling she has what kind of needs she
[1:08:38] has or what kind of person she is
[1:08:44] like I said whether it's providing you
[1:08:48] know for the children everything in that
[1:08:50] household lands on the man
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:55] it's his responsibility even the problem
[1:08:58] said a wife will never answer for us but
[1:09:00] the husband will answer for the life
[1:09:03] folks if she's hot headed if she's not
[1:09:06] hard-headed no matter what it is
[1:09:09] you gotta deal with it
[1:09:11] it's yours it's your responsibility
[1:09:16] okay how heavy it gets how hard it gets
[1:09:18] you got to work through it
[1:09:21] folks we've had our spats
[1:09:23] oh we've had our spots I know what
[1:09:25] that's all about
[1:09:28] praise the Lord
[1:09:30] I know what it's like to have to come
[1:09:32] back and say I'm
[1:09:33] sorry honey
[1:09:38] example apologize
[1:09:42] huh
[1:09:44] I shouldn't handled it that way if you
[1:09:46] really look close you'd realize that
[1:09:48] when she got hot you're supposed to stay
[1:09:50] calm
[1:09:55] oh boy where's the back door here
[1:09:58] hey man
[1:10:01] you feel like you're
[1:10:05] cause we as human beings I don't care we
[1:10:07] always think but right it don't matter

[1:16:57] wonderful savior father we have he's a

[1:17:05] he washes it
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:08] he keeps it clean
[1:17:11] so what did it say that the woman is
[1:17:14] entrusted with a certain virtue and
[1:17:18] cleanliness what does a wife do a wife
[1:17:20] keeps the house clean isn't that right
[1:17:21] feeds the children

[1:17:34] prophets and evangelists and so forth
[1:17:36] for the perfecting of the search to keep

[1:17:42] well there's a people after God stay
[1:17:44] clean in our hearts
[1:17:45] amen
[1:17:47] how do we get fed by the foolishness of
[1:17:50] preaching or to feed the children
[1:17:53] the church feeds the children amen
[1:17:56] that's where responsibility
[1:17:59] praise be the God but if you're a dad
[1:18:03] you're a husband and a father sometimes
[1:18:06] you think well it's just a little
[1:18:08] overwhelming
[1:18:12] taking care of everything making sure
[1:18:13] everything is taken care of let me
[1:18:16] believe that's your responsibility it
[1:18:18] weighs heavy sometimes then I thought
[1:18:20] about God how does God feel all over the
[1:18:23] world his wife his children all of it
[1:18:25] how many knows he's responsible
[1:18:28] for making sure
[1:18:30] that she's without spot
[1:18:32] that she's without wrinkle it's his job
[1:18:34] to wash Us by the washing of the Water
[1:18:36] by the word
[1:18:38] amen let me tell you something the
[1:18:39] church world the false Church she
[1:18:41] doesn't get Washed by the Water of the
[1:18:43] word she refuses the word that would
[1:18:45] wash her
[1:18:46] and make her clean amen
[1:18:50] my
[1:18:52] but I'm so glad to be part of God's
[1:18:54] child amen keep yourself pure for
[1:18:58] her
[1:18:59] husband and so forth amen
[1:19:04] all right
[1:19:05] how about a brother let's look at him
[1:19:08] for a few minutes as a brother
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:13] in Hebrews 2
[1:19:16] Hebrews 2
[1:19:23] foreign
[1:19:27] there was another one
[1:19:30] that I didn't write down
[1:19:34] um
[1:19:35] ah
[1:19:37] maybe I tagged it
[1:19:39] maybe I did
[1:19:42] John 15 14.
[1:19:45] 10 15 14. yeah I did tag it I didn't
[1:19:48] write it down but I did take it we'll go
[1:19:51] to that next Hebrews 2
[1:19:57] and verse 11 for both he that
[1:20:00] sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified
[1:20:04] are all one how many knows if that's
[1:20:06] what he's doing to his church he's
[1:20:08] sanctified
[1:20:10] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:20:12] call them brethren
[1:20:16] amen I'm really glad that he's your
[1:20:18] brother
[1:20:20] that's right saying I will declare unto
[1:20:23] you my brother my name unto my brethren
[1:20:26] in the midst of the church will I sing
[1:20:28] praise unto thee and again I will put my
[1:20:31] trust in him and again behold I and the
[1:20:34] children which God hath given me for as
[1:20:37] much then as children children are
[1:20:39] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[1:20:42] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:20:44] that's who death he might destroy him
[1:20:46] that had power over death that is the
[1:20:48] devil and to deliver them whose deaths
[1:20:52] were all their lifetimes subject to
[1:20:53] bondage for barely he took not on him
[1:20:57] the nature of angels but took him on the
[1:21:00] seat of Abraham wherever ain't all
[1:21:02] things it behooves him to be made like
[1:21:06] unto his Brethren that he might be a
[1:21:09] merciful and faithful high priest and
[1:21:11] things pertaining unto God and to make
[1:21:14] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:21:16] people for in that he for in that he
[1:21:19] himself suffered being tempted that he
[1:21:23] is able to sucker them that are tempted
[1:21:27] how many's got to have a brother that
[1:21:29] understands you that you can have
[1:21:31] fellowship with that you can talk to
[1:21:33] that you can open up a power
[1:21:37] and that's goddess the same story as uh
[1:21:40] Ruth and Boaz he became Kinsman to us he
[1:21:44] became one of us
[1:21:46] don't think so chapter 4 15 of Saint
[1:21:49] John says ye are my friends
[1:21:53] amen if ye do whatsoever thinks this is
[1:21:56] friendship now I didn't mean to go there
[1:21:58] but here we are yeah my friends if you
[1:22:00] do whatever I command you henceforth I
[1:22:02] call you not servants for the servant
[1:22:04] noeth not what his Lord doeth but I have
[1:22:06] called you friends for all things that I
[1:22:09] have heard of my father have I made
[1:22:11] known unto you amen
[1:22:13] so now notice how it says that he said
[1:22:15] that he became our brother he became
[1:22:18] as she became of Deceit Abraham
[1:22:22] and in the story of Ruth and Boaz we
[1:22:25] know that there was one that was closer
[1:22:28] kin
[1:22:29] isn't that right there was one closer to
[1:22:32] kin to Ruth than what Boaz was
[1:22:35] amen he had to go and he had to make
[1:22:37] known to the public and everybody hey do
[1:22:39] you want to redeem her and he couldn't
[1:22:41] redeem her isn't that right because he
[1:22:43] would have martyred at what he had going
[1:22:45] on let me tell you something he can't
[1:22:47] redeem God's children
[1:22:49] and so he went there and Boaz redeemed
[1:22:52] to Ruth
[1:22:53] praise be to God and that's where it was
[1:22:55] with Jesus amen you and I were closer
[1:22:58] related to the devil the Bible says that
[1:23:01] we are uh had our conversation at the
[1:23:03] Times past according to the Flesh and
[1:23:05] the prince of the power of the air and
[1:23:07] we're by Nature the children of
[1:23:08] disobedience
[1:23:10] isn't that right so we had a closer
[1:23:12] relationship to the devil but guess what
[1:23:14] God come down and he paid for our sin he
[1:23:17] come and redeemed us back
[1:23:19] and said look not only are you my
[1:23:21] brother you're now my brother
[1:23:23] he's my father he's my mother he's my
[1:23:26] brother
[1:23:28] aren't you glad for him being your
[1:23:30] brother
[1:23:32] but you know what stick is closer than
[1:23:34] the brother
[1:23:36] a friend
[1:23:37] one place that says his friend sticketh
[1:23:39] closer than a brother
[1:23:41] not that God is not completely sticking
[1:23:44] with you but it's just that you know
[1:23:45] when you have a friend you can consult
[1:23:48] with them you can talk to them you can
[1:23:50] tell them about anything and they'll be
[1:23:52] a friend
[1:23:53] amen and that's what Jesus said he says
[1:23:56] you know now you're you're my friends
[1:23:58] amen I don't call you servants anymore
[1:24:00] because I'm going to tell you what did
[1:24:02] he say he says
[1:24:04] uh
[1:24:05] but I have called you friends for all
[1:24:08] things that I have heard of the father
[1:24:09] have I made known
[1:24:12] and unto you
[1:24:13] praise the lord it's kind of like a like
[1:24:16] mother Brown said in our invisible Union
[1:24:17] I believe it was hard that how that God
[1:24:19] was whispering love secrets to his bride
[1:24:23] how many believe that that's why he was
[1:24:25] whispering love secrets to his bride
[1:24:26] telling her you know I had my eye on you
[1:24:29] from the very beginning I knew way way
[1:24:32] back I knew that it was gonna be late
[1:24:34] with love at first sight I knew he was
[1:24:36] gonna be my wife
[1:24:38] world
[1:24:40] just love Secrets like that
[1:24:42] boy isn't that nice
[1:24:44] to know that he now most of the people
[1:24:46] thought well the only reason that I'm a
[1:24:48] Christian is because I chose to be a
[1:24:50] Christian and then God chose me on that
[1:24:52] night that I gave my heart to the altar
[1:24:54] and if I mess up I may not
[1:24:57] become oh I made me get thrown out but
[1:25:00] how would you like a love secret like
[1:25:02] that
[1:25:03] but you're relying on yourself and so no
[1:25:05] how many knows we have the kind of love
[1:25:07] Secrets he even had the begun a good
[1:25:10] work in you is able to perform it if he
[1:25:13] started the work he's gonna finish it
[1:25:18] but you got to be made
[1:25:20] of his things of his flesh of his blood
[1:25:23] blood amen
[1:25:24] praise be to God
[1:25:27] is good
[1:25:29] amen praise the Lord
[1:25:31] that's right
[1:25:33] you know brother bam talked about Mary
[1:25:35] and Elizabeth and how they would come
[1:25:37] and how they would hug each other and
[1:25:38] greet each other and have real sisterly
[1:25:40] love amen
[1:25:42] now I'm not a sister so I can't really
[1:25:44] speak as a sister but I do know that
[1:25:46] there's some real genuine sweetness that
[1:25:49] goes on between sisters and a lot of
[1:25:52] times listen even between uh sisters or
[1:25:55] even girls that are friends
[1:25:57] not nice or
[1:25:59] or guys that are friends
[1:26:02] huh
[1:26:03] you can put your shoulder on them you
[1:26:05] give them a hug and love them you know
[1:26:07] this out of the other real genuine
[1:26:09] friendship isn't that nice
[1:26:11] yeah that's the way it was with Christ
[1:26:14] but you know the way the world's got it
[1:26:16] nowadays but I'm talking about love and
[1:26:18] and so forth he says you know but now
[1:26:19] with that brother or whatever goes too
[1:26:21] far with that and they got a pervert it
[1:26:23] that's not love
[1:26:25] brother Brandon remember how he talked
[1:26:26] about there's different degrees of love
[1:26:28] there's a agape love there's Ophelia
[1:26:30] love there's a perverted love there's a
[1:26:32] lust
[1:26:33] huh there's just all kinds of that mess
[1:26:36] they call it love
[1:26:38] let me tell you people those people that
[1:26:41] are totally Antichrist and everything
[1:26:42] well God loves us all no you got the
[1:26:44] wrong kind of love because I'll tell you
[1:26:46] what if God really does love you he
[1:26:48] would smack you upside your face
[1:26:49] and tell you you better straighten up
[1:26:51] but I'll send you soul to hell
[1:26:53] ah he would correct you wouldn't he
[1:26:55] that's the real kind of love you first

[1:27:09] gone to
[1:27:10] praise be to God
[1:27:12] how perverted the love is out there
[1:27:15] absolute perversion
[1:27:17] it's sad isn't it
[1:27:19] to think of what they have made amen
[1:27:24] you know my wife was reading me
[1:27:26] something off of YouTube I guess or
[1:27:28] something like on the way to church and
[1:27:29] she laughed and so forth and I think it
[1:27:31] was one of our relatives said something
[1:27:33] about he says if I have children I sure
[1:27:36] hope that they're really if they're you
[1:27:38] know homeschooled and and the world
[1:27:40] thinks you know that when you're
[1:27:41] homeschooled that you're you're weird
[1:27:44] he says well I hope my child is the
[1:27:47] weirdest thing that they've ever seen

[1:27:51] walking down the Halls now acting like
[1:27:53] chickens and ducks and animals and now

[1:28:20] we have in Jesus all our sins and griefs

[1:28:31] folks amen absolutely a real friend
[1:28:36] praise the Lord I want to I want to come
[1:28:38] down to the end of this and I want to
[1:28:40] dwell on something else for just a
[1:28:42] minute
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:49] and that is
[1:28:52] what it is said that a real family is to
[1:28:56] be
[1:28:57] and how that the wife of course being
[1:29:01] the type of the church and so forth
[1:29:05] how that she is to be the betting ground
[1:29:07] for life
[1:29:10] how many believe that
[1:29:12] she is to bring forth children
[1:29:14] of God
[1:29:16] and that's how the whole program goes
[1:29:19] why do you think that they're after our
[1:29:20] kids in the school
[1:29:23] how many agrees that this is a layout as
[1:29:25] your age and what they're doing is
[1:29:27] they're come
[1:29:29] completely blind
[1:29:31] to the fact that the devil is absolutely
[1:29:33] using them
[1:29:35] destroy civilization destroy Society
[1:29:38] destroy the home destroy the marriage
[1:29:42] one of the greatest it was it was a
[1:29:45] milestone of iniquity whenever the
[1:29:47] Supreme Court ruled that there could be
[1:29:50] a marriage acknowledged between two men
[1:29:53] or two women when they acknowledge that
[1:29:55] because if I'm not wrong uh even the
[1:29:59] liberal very liberal Mr Clinton
[1:30:01] acknowledged that marriage is to be
[1:30:03] between a man and a woman
[1:30:06] look how far they've gone even the
[1:30:08] Supreme Court now and changing it and so
[1:30:09] forth amen
[1:30:12] but destroying the family unit
[1:30:14] and you know God the devil's trying to
[1:30:17] do the same thing
[1:30:20] Amen in in God's church and God's people
[1:30:23] is to destroy that's all he knows how to

[1:30:43] and he talks about a woman having a baby
[1:30:45] now listen he says now if a woman won't
[1:30:48] have a baby for her husband she'll
[1:30:50] take a dog
[1:30:52] or a cat or child to her husband than to
[1:30:55] raise it to the service of God that's
[1:30:57] entirely out of these false churches
[1:31:00] lying amen she'll be so disgraced if she
[1:31:04] did
[1:31:05] our sin loving Society of
[1:31:09] 1965 type of woman amen a true picture
[1:31:13] of the modern church now how many knows
[1:31:15] that the Brother Band said the women out

[1:31:32] won any of these little here screaming
[1:31:36] and shouting and tongue speakings Acts 2
[1:31:38] 38 young ones around her

[1:31:44] only kind that really God produces
[1:31:48] as far as any more book of Acts of

[1:31:52] to act the same way they did
[1:31:54] oh my she don't want any of them
[1:31:56] whooping and crying and screaming and
[1:31:58] Hate

[1:32:41] would immediately put me put out of her
[1:32:43] denomination oh my
[1:32:46] God they had one like that in one of the
[1:32:47] churches where they throw her out right
[1:32:49] quick why would you let that they would
[1:32:51] say why that's small but you see she's
[1:32:53] pregnant it was something because she's
[1:32:55] bringing forth members all the time
[1:32:58] oh my listen to this let me let me jump
[1:33:00] down here and I'll pick that up
[1:33:03] now I know another thing he says notice
[1:33:06] what kind of children should she's
[1:33:08] bearing
[1:33:09] that's what
[1:33:11] they are amen who is that Papa
[1:33:18] that's right
[1:33:20] what kind of Papa they have whether it's
[1:33:22] from the first Adam or the second Adam
[1:33:25] if the church brings forth a child of
[1:33:27] the second Adam he has the second Adam's
[1:33:30] way of acting like the way they did on
[1:33:32] Pentecost that just a real true second
[1:33:35] Adam's children
[1:33:38] how many knows that he came that he
[1:33:40] because his father he wanted to bring
[1:33:43] many sons like himself according to
[1:33:46] Romans 8 chapter that he might be the
[1:33:49] first born among many Brethren how many
[1:33:51] believes if you're a child of God you're
[1:33:53] going to act like a child of God if you
[1:33:55] got the Holy Ghost you're going to act
[1:33:56] like the Holy Ghost
[1:34:00] anything else is adultery everything
[1:34:03] else is a hypocrite that's uh you know
[1:34:05] because even describe the Pharisees said
[1:34:07] oh they look like they were but inside
[1:34:09] they were full of dead men's bones
[1:34:11] that's the way it is in the church world
[1:34:13] today I'll tell you what the outside
[1:34:14] sometimes it might look alright but
[1:34:16] inside you're full of dead man's bone
[1:34:17] the outside don't even look right
[1:34:19] listen to me that that false church amen
[1:34:22] she loved their Master they love their
[1:34:24] God they love their husband and their
[1:34:26] husband is the devil he lets them do
[1:34:29] anything they want to they can come up
[1:34:30] here to our character wear pants they
[1:34:32] can wear this out of the other they can
[1:34:34] wear makeup they can cut their hair the
[1:34:36] women are even allowed to preach
[1:34:40] let me tell you something the pre the
[1:34:42] women are lying in the Presbyterian and
[1:34:44] the Nazarene Church up here even that
[1:34:46] even my own Banker up there soapies as
[1:34:48] you know they were having a debate
[1:34:49] whether they were let homosexuals preach
[1:34:51] and so forth
[1:34:54] can you imagine Newton while they opened
[1:34:56] it up first they left
[1:34:58] word by saying that women could preach
[1:35:00] and so forth now they got homosexuals
[1:35:02] nothing else
[1:35:04] now you see why the Bible says she said
[1:35:06] the mother of Harlot full of the
[1:35:08] Abominations and filthiness of her
[1:35:10] fornication
[1:35:13] claiming to be married to Christ
[1:35:17] but filthy
[1:35:19] beyond belief
[1:35:22] adulterer see that's what it's all about
[1:35:24] that's what it was all about at the
[1:35:26] beginning that's what it's all about at
[1:35:28] the end spiritual fornications
[1:35:32] that's why people commit spiritual
[1:35:34] fornication
[1:35:38] oh my sad isn't it
[1:35:40] oh my second that am I like this
[1:35:45] oh my that did on the day of Pentecost
[1:35:49] that's the true second Adam's children
[1:35:50] that's right the nature is like his amen
[1:35:54] yes sir now her daughters painted face
[1:35:57] bobbed head women wearing men's clothes
[1:36:00] sizes causers the Bible said for not to
[1:36:03] do it she cuts her hair it's a shame to
[1:36:05] her and so forth you say shut up on that
[1:36:07] that's what they were
[1:36:08] bird says I'm pointing out to the nature

[1:36:55] awful uncomfortable sitting around here
[1:36:57] with a mini skirt on
[1:37:02] Rubble around here hey man with short
[1:37:04] hair with makeup on
[1:37:08] Bible says not to cut her hair Bible
[1:37:10] Paul said he said you know that a woman
[1:37:13] is supposed to be silent she is
[1:37:14] forbidden to speak in church if she has
[1:37:16] a question go home and ask her husband
[1:37:18] amen but but they do it anyway

[1:37:51] what we do what we listen to and that

[1:37:54] spiritual fornications against almighty
[1:37:56] God you are responsible to keep your
