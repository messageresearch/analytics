[22:43] We're walking [music] up the king's
[22:46] [singing] high way. Hallelujah. Give the
[22:49] Lord a hand clap of praise this morning.
[22:52] Thank you, Lord, for the highway to
[22:54] heaven.
[22:56] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[22:57] Lord this morning and thankful for
[23:00] everybody out on this crisp sunny Sunday
[23:03] morning.
[23:04] Amen. [music] I tell you, I was thinking
[23:06] about uh thinking about this song here,
[23:08] and I thought, what a time of season
[23:11] we're in here when, [music] you know,
[23:12] Mary and Joseph, they was walking down a
[23:14] highway that they walked that highway so
[23:17] that we could have a highway.
[23:20] And Jesus was born there and then he
[23:24] walked a highway.
[23:26] He walked a highway to Calvary.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; You thankful for that King's highway
[23:31] this morning? Amen. Good to be in the
[23:33] house of the Lord. We do have a couple
[23:35] of uh of announcements real quick if you
[23:38] just don't mind stay standing with us.
[23:39] But good to have the Hallbaggers back
[23:41] and I know they've been on the road and
[23:42] traveling and cruising and different
[23:45] different areas and so different places.
[23:47] Good to have them back. But we do want
[23:49] to give the Lord praise. We do want to
[23:51] give him thanks for what he's done for
[23:53] us and what he's done for the bride and
[23:55] and our friends and families and
[23:56] different ones. But if you don't know
[23:59] the uh McCagan uh their her babies were
[24:03] born two nights ago, I think it was
[24:05] Polly and Palmer. And you know, eight
[24:08] weeks ago, the doctors said they needed
[24:10] to abort one
[24:12] &gt;&gt; so that one could survive. Well, we
[24:14] didn't agree to that. We didn't agree to
[24:16] what the doctor said. We we went we took
[24:19] it to a second opinion.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Polly was born one pound 7 oz.
[24:27] 1B 7 oz and Palmer was 1B5 ounces and
[24:32] they're both doing good. McCagan's doing
[24:34] good. Give the Lord praise. [applause]
[24:39] Hallelujah. They're very thankful this
[24:42] morning. And [applause]
[24:44] you know, the doctor said that uh uh
[24:46] that they needed to abort Polly because
[24:48] she was too small, weren't going to make
[24:50] it. Well, uh, you know, she's she's no
[24:53] longer on a respirator or I guess uh uh
[24:56] intubated no more. She's breathing on
[24:58] her own and and Palmer's not far behind.
[25:01] So, that just goes to show that uh when
[25:03] God takes control, when he puts the
[25:06] breath of life in, Satan can't snuff it
[25:09] out. So, we just want to thank the Lord
[25:11] for that. Also, uh we do want to
[25:13] remember or or give some praise report
[25:15] first for brother Ben Norro. I was
[25:17] talking to him last night and he just
[25:18] got back and had some tremendous
[25:20] meetings overseas. I think 20 20 people
[25:23] was give their heart to the Lord and
[25:24] over 20 baptized and in his meetings.
[25:27] But you know that didn't uh that didn't
[25:29] settle too well with Satan. And this
[25:31] morning he he woke up in in severe pain
[25:34] and had an acute appendicitis. So he's
[25:36] in surgery today. So uh good thing he's
[25:39] back in the States. I I if I got to be
[25:42] cut on, I would prefer to be cut on in
[25:44] my home country. So, Brother Joe, would
[25:46] you start making your way up here? We do
[25:48] have some, uh, the other needs we want
[25:51] to take before the Lord. And so, uh, we
[25:53] want to remember Brother Steve's cousin,
[25:55] uh, Mike Langley fighting cancer this
[25:58] morning. And, and, um, I think his his
[26:01] mom had just recently passed away with
[26:04] cancer and now he's he's fighting
[26:06] cancer. So, he's got a lot, uh, on his
[26:09] mind, a lot on his plate physically,,
[26:11] spiritually, mentally. So, remember him
[26:13] in prayer. Also, we got a note we want
[26:16] to I guess from Sister Adriana. We want
[26:18] to remember uh Mansky. Uh she's got to
[26:20] go for some tests, I guess, on Tuesday.
[26:23] She sees a specialist and she's asking
[26:25] for a clean bill of health. Also, pray
[26:27] for her son. Uh he's been really sick
[26:30] and in a lot of pain. Needs a touch from
[26:32] the Lord as well as her mom. Her mom's
[26:35] uh has surgery on January the 5th to
[26:38] remove what the doctors believe is
[26:39] cancer. And so, uh, we're just going to
[26:42] believe that the doctors go in there and
[26:44] they do their surgery, you know, and we
[26:46] just pray that the doctor's hands are
[26:48] led by the Lord, they get all the cancer
[26:51] and remove it all and that it hasn't
[26:53] spread anywhere. So, that's what we'll
[26:54] believe, right?
[26:55] &gt;&gt; We're believers, so we're going to
[26:57] believe on these things. So, Brother
[26:58] Joe, if you would just take these knees
[27:00] before the Lord in prayer.
[27:09] The Lord knows each heart here this
[27:11] morning. I don't know what none of y'all
[27:14] have need of. Maybe my wife and then I
[27:17] don't know. [music] So whatever you have
[27:19] need of, the same God that can take care
[27:23] of two little babies, he can answer your
[27:25] request.
[27:27] So, we all just this morning, we'd never
[27:30] know when it's our last service,
[27:33] &gt;&gt; you know, and I come expecting, and I
[27:35] know y'all did, too. You didn't just
[27:37] show up, you know, just to be here to to
[27:40] show people you come to church, you
[27:43] know, [music] and
[27:45] so the Lord knows all about it. So,
[27:46] everybody just everybody just [music]
[27:48] pray this morning. You know, it didn't
[27:50] just me, but everybody just prayed. Pray
[27:53] for one another. And you know what you
[27:55] have need of? Just believe the Lord will
[27:57] give you the desire of your heart.
[28:00] Lord, we come before you this morning,
[28:02] Lord Jesus. Lord, there's no way I can
[28:05] remember all the stuff that Brother Brad
[28:07] just mentioned, but Lord, just thinking
[28:10] about them little babies. He was reading
[28:12] it and Lord and I think they were born
[28:14] last night cuz at 2:00 Lord they was
[28:18] calling to tell Hannah Lord and I just
[28:21] watched the situation Lord knowing that
[28:24] she had to stay in a hospital several
[28:26] days and Lord the route that you made it
[28:29] go Lord they didn't even think the one
[28:33] Lord they didn't think it would make it
[28:35] but that was the one that had to fight
[28:37] the hardest and the first one that's
[28:39] doing the test. So Lord, we know Lord
[28:42] that you're still the same yesterday,
[28:45] today, and forever.
[28:47] And Lord, all of us this morning, we're
[28:49] needy. Lord, Lord, we know where you
[28:52] brought us from. You know what you
[28:55] helped us to overcome.
[28:57] Lord, we know what you're doing in our
[28:59] lives now, Lord, in our homes and our
[29:01] marriages, Lord, our businesses.
[29:04] But Lord, this morning as me and Hannah
[29:06] was talking hours ago, Lord, we just
[29:10] want to be more like you, Lord, because
[29:11] we know we're if we were to have to
[29:13] stand before you, Lord Jesus, Lord, we
[29:17] we don't want to be ashamed and say,
[29:19] Lord, we're sorry and had to make up
[29:22] excuses for why we didn't do better in
[29:25] certain situations in our lives,
[29:28] Lord. No doubt some sitting here this
[29:30] morning, Lord has went backwards instead
[29:33] of going forward.
[29:35] Lord, no doubt got still got bad habits
[29:38] in their life, a stumbling block to
[29:40] their kids, Lord Jesus. Lord, we've been
[29:43] there so we know what it's like and it's
[29:46] not a good condition to be in.
[29:49] Lord, we just ask this morning, Lord
[29:51] Jesus, that you would come, Lord, in a
[29:54] special way. Lord, we we sense, Lord,
[29:58] that as soon as we have to walk up here,
[30:00] it's different standing up here than it
[30:02] is sitting out there. But Lord, we know
[30:05] our pastor, Lord, the struggles and the
[30:09] Lord to keep pressing on him and his
[30:12] family. Lord, I know when he comes out,
[30:14] Lord, he studied, has thoughts. But
[30:18] Lord, we ask you'd use his lips, Lord
[30:20] Jesus, that we could leave here, Lord,
[30:23] knowing that we're headed where we're
[30:25] supposed to go. Lord, we ask you be to
[30:28] rest this service and the singing. Lord,
[30:31] let everybody give worship and praise.
[30:34] Lord, sometime we don't understand why
[30:36] some can't, Lord. Lord, they have no
[30:39] hallelujah, no amens.
[30:42] Lord, we know, Lord, in reality, it
[30:45] means something is not right. They're
[30:47] dead, Lord Jesus. Cuz Lord, you said
[30:49] everything has breath. Let it give
[30:52] praise. So Lord, I ask that you would be
[30:54] with every one, Lord. whatever's got
[30:57] them bound and they can't seem to get
[30:59] over it day after day and year after
[31:01] year that they would finally break loose
[31:04] and get rid of that demon, that devil
[31:06] that caused them not to be able to,
[31:08] Lord, to enter in and give you praise,
[31:10] Lord. [music] Lord, and we just want to
[31:12] tell you that we love you this morning,
[31:15] Lord. We're thankful that we could come,
[31:16] Lord Jesus, because Lord, we could have
[31:19] been somewhere else, Lord, if it hadn't
[31:21] been for your mercy and grace. Lord, I
[31:23] love you this morning. in your precious
[31:25] name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Let's turn in our Bibles to Psalms.
[31:58] Psalms 19.
[32:14] The heavens declare the glory of God,
[32:16] and the firmament showeth his handiwork.
[32:26] There is no speech nor language where
[32:29] their voice is not heard.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Which is as a bridegroom coming out of
[32:43] his chamber, and rejoicth as a strong
[32:47] man to run a race.
[32:59] The law of the Lord is perfect,
[33:01] converting the soul. The testimony of
[33:04] the Lord is sure, making wise the
[33:07] simple.
[33:17] The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring
[33:20] forever. The judgments of the Lord are
[33:23] true and righteous altogether.
[33:35] Moreover, by them is thy servant warned,
[33:39] and in keeping of them there is great
[33:42] reward.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Keep back thy servant also from
[33:51] presumptuous sins. Let them not have
[33:54] dominion over me. Then shall I be
[33:57] upright and I shall be innocent from the
[34:00] great transgression. This one together.
[34:03] Let the words of th my mouth and the
[34:05] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[34:08] thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my
[34:12] redeemer. Amen. God bless you.
[34:20] Amen. Please speak to the mountains this
[34:22] morning.

[1:02:25] Lord Jesus, we humbly come before you
[1:02:27] once again, assembling ourselves
[1:02:29] together in your name, Lord. And we
[1:02:32] pray, Father, that you'll take every
[1:02:33] spirit in here under the control of the
[1:02:35] Holy Spirit, so that you can have the
[1:02:37] liberty, Lord Jesus, to say what you
[1:02:39] once said, Father, and perform and do
[1:02:42] just what you want done this morning. We
[1:02:44] ask God that every hindering spirit
[1:02:46] would be Lord, brought under control and
[1:02:50] subdued, so to speak, Father, so that
[1:02:51] each and everyone would have liberty,
[1:02:53] Lord, to be able to receive your word
[1:02:54] this morning. Lord, if there's needing
[1:02:57] need of healing this morning, that
[1:02:58] people would be healed. Amen. If people
[1:03:01] need the filling of the Holy Spirit,
[1:03:02] people could be filled with the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost. If anyone is not saved this
[1:03:06] morning, that they would accept you as
[1:03:08] their personal savior. And as we
[1:03:10] endeavor, Lord Jesus, to speak, Father,
[1:03:12] what we feel like you've laid us upon
[1:03:14] our hearts, Lord, and Father, guided our
[1:03:17] hearts in a certain direction. And just,
[1:03:19] Lord, trying to be sensitive, Lord
[1:03:21] Jesus, to what you want, not what I
[1:03:23] want, but what you want, Father. And
[1:03:26] Father, we just ask for your direction
[1:03:27] now, Lord, and your blessing upon the
[1:03:29] service in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:31] Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[1:03:35] turn our Bibles, if you will, to Second
[1:03:37] Peter. Second Peter
[1:03:48] three.
[1:03:50] And I want to start with just basically
[1:03:52] a verse. Amen. That came to my heart,
[1:03:56] came to my mind that I want to try to
[1:03:58] build off of. Amen. Chapter 3, verse 10,
[1:04:02] I mean nine.
[1:04:04] The Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:04:07] promise, as men count slackness, but is
[1:04:11] longsuffering to usward, not willing
[1:04:13] that any should perish, but that all
[1:04:16] should come to repentance. But the day
[1:04:19] of the Lord will come as a thief in the
[1:04:20] night, into the which the heavens will
[1:04:22] pass away with a great noise, and the
[1:04:24] elements shall melt with fervent heat.
[1:04:27] the earth also and all and the and the
[1:04:31] works that are therein shall be burnt
[1:04:34] up. Seeing then that all these things
[1:04:37] shall be dissolved, what manner of
[1:04:39] persons ought we to be in all holy
[1:04:41] conversation and godliness. And
[1:04:44] everybody said,
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; "Looking for and hasting unto the coming
[1:04:48] of the day of God, wherein the heavens
[1:04:51] being on fire,
[1:04:53] notice how it says the the heavens
[1:04:55] there." Amen.
[1:04:59] Shall be on fire,
[1:05:03] shall be dissolved, and the elements
[1:05:04] shall melt with fervent heat.
[1:05:06] Nevertheless, we according to his
[1:05:08] promise, look for a new heavens and a
[1:05:10] new earth, wherein dwelleth
[1:05:11] righteousness. Wherefore, beloved,
[1:05:14] seeing that ye look for such things, be
[1:05:16] diligent that you be be found of him.
[1:05:18] And notice these three things. Be found
[1:05:20] of him in peace.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:25] peace without spot, all your sins
[1:05:28] forgiven,
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; right with God. And third, blameless.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; How many knows if you're spotless, then
[1:05:35] you're also blameless. May God add his
[1:05:37] blessings to the reading of the word. My
[1:05:39] title this morning is going to be the
[1:05:43] love and grace of God. Amen.
[1:05:47] Amen.
[1:05:48] Reminded me of that song, I saw love,
[1:05:50] mercy, grace. Amen. I envisioned his
[1:05:54] beauty. I looked upon his face and I saw
[1:05:57] love, mercy, and grace. Amen. Praise the
[1:06:03] Lord. So this morning, we want to talk
[1:06:05] about that. Just begin to think about
[1:06:07] how that there in Peter and how that
[1:06:10] we've been talking Wednesday, Wednesday
[1:06:12] evening, we talked about u
[1:06:15] Amen. How that the angels which kept not
[1:06:17] their first estate, how that they had a
[1:06:19] choice. Ain't that right? In heaven,
[1:06:21] whenever the angels chose to take sides
[1:06:25] with the enemy, isn't that right, with
[1:06:28] the devil, they had to make a choice.
[1:06:32] And they made the choice.
[1:06:35] Whenever that rumor was going around and
[1:06:38] whenever that gossip was going around,
[1:06:41] God's church,
[1:06:44] God's people, God's angels,
[1:06:47] you know, God just, you know, he gets
[1:06:50] all the credit,
[1:06:52] God gets all the glory, y'all.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Y'all don't get enough glory. [applause]
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, listen, that's what they were
[1:07:01] saying. and and we deserve some of this
[1:07:03] is what they were trying is the rumor
[1:07:05] that was going around.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; That was the seed that the devil was
[1:07:09] sewing.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; You know, everybody bows and everybody
[1:07:13] praises him and all of you know and
[1:07:15] we're great angels, mighty angels.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; We got great power. We should have some
[1:07:21] of that. You know, Dayton had the same
[1:07:23] idea, didn't he?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Nathan and Car had that same idea that
[1:07:27] they wanted to be a somebody.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:07:32] And
[1:07:35] you know, God had a great division
[1:07:37] happen in heaven. First division ever
[1:07:39] happened was in heaven. Ain't that
[1:07:40] right?
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And we talked about this and I don't
[1:07:46] really hadn't anticipated to go down
[1:07:48] here, but I'm just going to follow the
[1:07:49] spirit. Is that okay?
[1:07:53] But they got to talking and and and God
[1:07:55] whenever Dayan when when Dayan had been
[1:07:58] this and and God had had a previous
[1:08:00] experience in heaven of this division
[1:08:02] that happened.
[1:08:05] My
[1:08:06] God wasn't too pleased with Dayan and
[1:08:08] Corora, was he?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:08:12] No. Because Moses is not He didn't make
[1:08:16] himself a prophet. He didn't make
[1:08:17] himself anything.
[1:08:19] Just like our prophet, he didn't make
[1:08:21] himself anything. He didn't try to be
[1:08:23] something.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And others were jealous just like Jesus
[1:08:27] when he was here. Jesus was who he was.
[1:08:30] And he was humble about it.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't have a fancy house and great
[1:08:35] big feast he could put together like you
[1:08:37] know that Pharisee did.
[1:08:40] Isn't that right? But he was what he was
[1:08:42] by the grace of God, what God had made
[1:08:44] him. But the Pharisees also, they were
[1:08:47] also jealous because they they had an
[1:08:50] ambition. They had pride in their
[1:08:53] hearts.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And God didn't like it too well with
[1:08:57] Dayan. And I mean, I you can only
[1:08:59] imagine how displeased God was with
[1:09:02] Dayan and Kora.
[1:09:07] How that Moses had to say, "Everybody
[1:09:10] that's on their side, stay there. But
[1:09:12] everybody, I'm giving you a chance to
[1:09:13] come over on my side.
[1:09:16] You get a chance.
[1:09:21] Give him mercy.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; So, and I don't know. I don't just maybe
[1:09:27] stop there. I you know but let me just
[1:09:30] say this that for some reason I'm trying
[1:09:32] to feel the direction that the Holy
[1:09:35] Spirit is taking my heart because
[1:09:41] I seem to be pulled maybe not so much
[1:09:44] not so much here for just this
[1:09:46] congregation but maybe somebody
[1:09:48] listening I don't know just why God is
[1:09:50] pulling me this way but I'm going to
[1:09:52] just go the way the Holy Spirit leads me
[1:09:54] to go. Is that okay?
[1:09:56] So when we talk about the the the mercy
[1:09:59] of grace, grace that's shown the love of
[1:10:01] God. How many knows that no doubt I
[1:10:04] don't know I don't know exactly what
[1:10:06] happened in heaven. I don't know if
[1:10:08] those angels were given the opportunity
[1:10:11] cuz you know God is a God of grace. God
[1:10:13] is a God of mercy. And so he he threw
[1:10:16] Moses to through Moses said, "Hey, y'all
[1:10:18] make your decision if you want to stay
[1:10:20] with Dayton or if you want to come over
[1:10:21] here.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But get away from them guys' tents.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Get away from them guys."
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's what Moses
[1:10:30] said. You don't want to be a part of it,
[1:10:31] but come over. And they all did. The
[1:10:34] ones that did. And then you know God Mo
[1:10:38] God God spoke through Moses and said
[1:10:39] God's going to do something if the earth
[1:10:41] open up his mouth and swallow him up.
[1:10:43] then you'll know that it was God.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And God hated that
[1:10:48] thing so bad because of his experience
[1:10:50] in heaven. That's why I say I don't know
[1:10:53] whether those angels up there if they
[1:10:55] were given a chance perhaps uh you know
[1:10:57] you know you're going to have to decide
[1:10:59] whether
[1:11:01] you're going to listen to that gossip
[1:11:02] that goes through the church.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; You have to make your choice because if
[1:11:09] you side with it, you'll become part of
[1:11:11] it. you partake of that sin.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But no doubt, you know, but they
[1:11:18] had their choice. They made their
[1:11:20] choice. They weren't born. And and you
[1:11:21] know, I never knew this. The sure don't
[1:11:24] preach it that those angels back there,
[1:11:28] the angels of heaven were put on free
[1:11:31] moral agency.
[1:11:34] Isn't that a great mystery? Isn't that a
[1:11:37] truth that we have not known? Through
[1:11:38] the prophet of God, they had a choice
[1:11:40] that they could make.
[1:11:43] True.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we read in Jude there
[1:11:47] where uh you know they're under chains
[1:11:49] of darkness
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; in prison
[1:11:53] held there until the day of judgment.
[1:11:56] And all they can think about perhaps is
[1:11:58] they had their choice. They had their
[1:12:00] time.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; And I guess my heart is that everybody
[1:12:06] hearing or listening, Amen. and
[1:12:08] streaming. No doubt, but there's
[1:12:10] something in your heart or you wouldn't
[1:12:12] stream there. So many people, they don't
[1:12:14] care about streaming. They don't hear
[1:12:15] care about hearing anything about the
[1:12:17] word of God when it's the only only
[1:12:20] absolute thing in this world that there
[1:12:23] is.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; There is no other absolute. Why would
[1:12:26] people not want to hear it?
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So those that are perhaps streaming,
[1:12:31] listening, or hearing me this morning,
[1:12:34] Amen. There's a purpose. There's a
[1:12:36] reason that you do. And I'm here to tell
[1:12:38] you both here and out there, amen, that
[1:12:41] God is a merciful God.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; God is a God of love.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That song says, "I saw love,
[1:12:51] mercy, and grace when I think about
[1:12:53] God." Amen. When I think about what he's
[1:12:56] done for me.
[1:12:58] Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; When I think of the grace that he has
[1:13:02] and the love that he has. Amen. Just
[1:13:04] like the Bible says, for God so loved
[1:13:06] the world, the whole world. God loved
[1:13:08] the whole world that he gave his only
[1:13:09] begotten son that whosoever believe in
[1:13:11] him should not perish but have
[1:13:13] everlasting life.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; We read this morning where he says, you
[1:13:18] know, God is longsuffering towards us
[1:13:20] work, not willing that any should
[1:13:21] perish, but that all might come to
[1:13:23] repentance.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. Wish the whole world
[1:13:30] could hear me this morning.
[1:13:32] You have to you are forced as a human
[1:13:36] being. You are forced to make a
[1:13:39] decision. You have to make a choice.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You don't have a choice in the matter.
[1:13:47] [laughter]
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't say, "Well, I'm just not
[1:13:50] going to make a choice." You just did
[1:13:52] make a choice.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; You chose to ignore a solemn warning
[1:13:57] that is given to you that you have to
[1:13:59] with God. You either have to accept his
[1:14:02] mercy and his grace and his love
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; or you have to accept the judgment of
[1:14:08] God.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; You have to do one or the other. You
[1:14:13] must make a choice of which one you're
[1:14:16] going to receive, what you're going to
[1:14:18] accept. Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; You can turn your face. You can turn it
[1:14:22] off. You can not listening. But one day
[1:14:25] you're going to meet God face to face.
[1:14:28] And you are going to have to give a
[1:14:30] reason and an account of what you choice
[1:14:32] that you made.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can ignore it now,
[1:14:40] but you'll pay then.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know sooner or later
[1:14:46] you're going to have to face the fact?
[1:14:47] That's why we preached on then and now.
[1:14:51] Amen. How many believe now is the day of
[1:14:53] salvation? Don't wait till then. We've
[1:14:55] had all the then and the now. We had so
[1:14:57] many warnings, so many illustrations of
[1:15:00] what people made the wrong choice, did
[1:15:02] the wrong thing, did not accept the
[1:15:04] grace of God in the past.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; And now, where [screaming] are they at?
[1:15:09] Where are their souls at?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; We don't look at our flesh. We don't
[1:15:14] look at our age. We don't look at our
[1:15:16] gray hair, brother. We don't care about
[1:15:18] getting old. We care about where this
[1:15:20] soul is going to be
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; in 10 years, 20 years from now. Where
[1:15:25] are we going to be at?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; How many That's what we're here for, to
[1:15:30] care about our soul.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; And when we think about the love of God
[1:15:37] and what he did by coming to the earth,
[1:15:40] died on a cross. How many know he died
[1:15:43] for us?
[1:15:46] He hung on a cross completely naked.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was not ashamed to do that for
[1:15:55] you and I. Why should we be ashamed of
[1:15:58] him?
[1:16:01] [applause]
[1:16:03] [cheering]
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. [applause]
[1:16:11] We've been speaking here
[1:16:14] and you know
[1:16:16] we understand that
[1:16:20] what you do with Christ today
[1:16:24] tells you what you would have done with
[1:16:26] Jesus on the shores of Galilee.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is a this is a major
[1:16:36] doctrine in the Bible. This is major
[1:16:38] thing in the Bible that irritated so to
[1:16:41] speak Jesus to the core
[1:16:44] cuz the Pharisees kept saying that they
[1:16:47] were Abraham the children of Abraham the
[1:16:49] seed of Abraham says I know that but
[1:16:51] here you seek to kill me and Abraham
[1:16:53] wrote of me how can you say that you
[1:16:55] Abraham's seed when you don't believe
[1:16:57] what he said
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; he got real straight with him you're of
[1:17:04] your father the devil that's who your
[1:17:05] daddy Yes. Why? Because you can't
[1:17:08] receive the manifested word for your
[1:17:11] hour.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; That's what we say today is if you can't
[1:17:15] receive Jesus of today, lie to me and
[1:17:18] tell me 2,000 years ago.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz you don't. You would have been
[1:17:23] there. You would have rejected him. You
[1:17:25] would have crucified him.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; How can you say that, brother Bible?
[1:17:31] Brother Ber, I'll tell you the
[1:17:33] scripture. Jesus said, "Woe unto you
[1:17:35] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[1:17:37] because you build the tombs of the
[1:17:39] prophets and garnish the separ of the
[1:17:41] righteous and say, whoa, well, if we'd
[1:17:44] have been in the days of our fathers, we
[1:17:46] would not have been partakers with them
[1:17:48] in the blood of our prophets." That's
[1:17:50] what you say. Wherefore, you're
[1:17:52] witnesses unto yourselves that ye are
[1:17:54] the children of them which killed the
[1:17:56] prophets. Amen. You serpents, you
[1:17:58] generation of vipers, how can you escape
[1:18:00] the damnation of hell? Wherefore,
[1:18:02] behold, I send unto you prophets and
[1:18:04] wise men and scribes, and some of them
[1:18:05] ye shall kill and crucify. Some of them
[1:18:08] they shall scourge in your synagogues
[1:18:09] and persecute them from city to city.
[1:18:13] Why? When they could not receive the
[1:18:14] word for their age,
[1:18:17] he says, "Don't bother." Amen. You act
[1:18:19] like you're varnishing all you love
[1:18:21] those prophets that of their tomb, but
[1:18:23] he says, "You're the one that put them
[1:18:25] in there."
[1:18:29] [sighs]
[1:18:30] [gasps]
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] Praise the Lord. Why? They had a choice
[1:18:35] they had to make at the time. Amen.
[1:18:40] How many know it's King Agria?
[1:18:43] Amen.
[1:18:45] King of Grippa. He come down to the
[1:18:47] place. Amen. Brother Brandham even
[1:18:50] preached a message called He was to pass
[1:18:52] his way. I mean know when Jesus passes
[1:18:55] by your way, you're on the spot. When
[1:18:59] the rich young ruler come up to Jesus
[1:19:01] and he wanted eternal life, he come to
[1:19:03] Jesus and then he wanted eternal life.
[1:19:05] He was on the spot. That was his time.
[1:19:11] When that gripper Paul tried his best to
[1:19:14] persuade him, you believe the prophets
[1:19:17] and he told them the whole story of how
[1:19:19] Jesus was to come and how he was
[1:19:20] supposed to die, how he did, how he rose
[1:19:22] again, how I saw the pillar of fire.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:31] See folks, a lot of people will believe
[1:19:33] this Jesus. Oh yeah, I believe this
[1:19:36] Jesus. But they will deny that he went
[1:19:39] back to the pillar of fire that he come
[1:19:41] out of.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; They'll deny that Jesus.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Nope. Don't want nothing to do with
[1:19:47] that.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; You just denied Christ and you don't
[1:19:51] real.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; That's what that was.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] So this morning, my heart's desired.
[1:19:59] What I want to talk about is that Paul
[1:20:01] said, he says, you know, eye has not
[1:20:03] seen, ear has not heard the things that
[1:20:05] are prepared for them that love him.
[1:20:10] How many believe that he loved us and we
[1:20:13] need to be loving him? I love him. I
[1:20:16] love him because he first loved me.
[1:20:18] [applause]
[1:20:22] Amen. You can't say that you love him
[1:20:24] and deny him. If you've got God on the
[1:20:27] inside, there's something [screaming]
[1:20:28] about you. There's something in there
[1:20:30] will not let you deny Christ.
[1:20:33] No man speaking by the Holy Ghost can
[1:20:36] call Jesus a cursed and so forth. And
[1:20:39] no, not by the Holy Ghost. You're not
[1:20:40] talking.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:45] Brother B preached a message called He
[1:20:46] Cares. Do you care?
[1:20:53] See folks, we're living in the
[1:20:55] dispensation. Let me We're living in the
[1:20:56] hour. We're living in the dispensation
[1:21:05] of
[1:21:07] the capstone.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Mike, if you can zoom in,
[1:21:14] if I can remember how this is done here.
[1:21:17] Right here.
[1:21:20] The capstone. What is that? Love.
[1:21:24] The capstone is love.
[1:21:27] We had Luther, we had Wesley, we had all
[1:21:29] these different ones, but we're in the
[1:21:31] age of love.
[1:21:34] How many believe that?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the love and the
[1:21:39] grace of Almighty God.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that he already loved us.
[1:21:45] He loved the world. He loved the rich
[1:21:48] young ruler.
[1:21:51] But it's something about it.
[1:21:54] The question is this morning, how much
[1:21:57] do we love him?
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:22:05] isn't that a good question? Doesn't that
[1:22:07] doesn't that touch your heart?
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; How much do you love him?
[1:22:14] And I don't know about you, brother
[1:22:15] Brad, but there's something in my heart
[1:22:17] that tells me I want to love him more.
[1:22:25] [applause]
[1:22:27] That's
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; right. All of you. I want to love him
[1:22:30] more. [screaming]
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; He deserves more of my love.
[1:22:40] I can give you all kinds of scriptures
[1:22:42] that tells you whether you love him or
[1:22:44] not and how much you love him. I may get
[1:22:46] time to. I don't know.
[1:22:50] Amen. But that's my heart's desire this
[1:22:53] morning is he cares.
[1:22:56] He cared.
[1:22:59] What about us? What about the world? Do
[1:23:00] they care?
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Brandon, he
[1:23:07] preached a message called He Cares, Do
[1:23:08] You Care? And he talked about the Hebrew
[1:23:11] children. They loved God.
[1:23:14] And even though they were going to get
[1:23:16] burnt, they weren't ashamed. They were
[1:23:19] going to get burnt [screaming]
[1:23:20] if God don't deliver them. He said, "We
[1:23:22] don't know if he will, but he's more
[1:23:23] than able."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; But there's one thing our commandments
[1:23:28] are, the word says for us not to bow
[1:23:30] down to idols and so forth, and we're
[1:23:32] not bowing.
[1:23:35] He said they cared and because they
[1:23:37] cared, God cared.
[1:23:40] In other words, how many believes it's
[1:23:41] our time [screaming] to love? He loved.
[1:23:44] Now it's our time to love back.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; But people have a hard time loving back.
[1:23:54] I know.
[1:23:56] Um let me just read you a prayer line.
[1:23:59] Brother Brandham said in thy life in
[1:24:01] kindness, Chattanooga, Tennessee in 58.
[1:24:05] And he had a healing service and he he
[1:24:08] prayed for people and so forth. And he
[1:24:09] told everybody, all of you that you know
[1:24:13] feels like God has touched you and has
[1:24:15] healed you. He you feel like there's
[1:24:17] something been wrong with you. If you
[1:24:19] couldn't move your hand, move it. That's
[1:24:21] right. In Christ's name, move it. Put
[1:24:23] your faith to the test. You know, if you
[1:24:26] can move it, raise up and come here. If
[1:24:29] you can't hear and you hear now, raise
[1:24:30] up and come here. If headache and it's
[1:24:33] gone, raise up and come here. If you're
[1:24:35] sick in your stomach, sick and it's
[1:24:37] gone, come here. Come up here and
[1:24:38] testify. Now, I'm going to make it a
[1:24:40] long story short.
[1:24:43] Listen.
[1:24:45] He says, "Somebody else that couldn't
[1:24:46] hear.
[1:24:48] You raise up and so forth. Come up.
[1:24:50] Don't be afraid. Are you afraid to put
[1:24:52] Christ to the test? What's wrong with
[1:24:54] you? If you're healed, raise your hand.
[1:24:56] Raise yourself up. Come up here. Let's
[1:24:57] testify to the glory of God. Let's give
[1:25:00] John God a chance to verify. That's
[1:25:02] right. Come on. See you coming. All
[1:25:04] right. Come on up. Different ones came
[1:25:06] up. He says, "Are you just bluffing? Was
[1:25:09] you just kidding Christ?" Christ has
[1:25:11] kept his word now. Did I stand here and
[1:25:15] uh how did I stand here in that
[1:25:18] challenge night after night if he didn't
[1:25:20] keep his word? Look at here. They're
[1:25:22] ready to testify. Here they are. They
[1:25:24] come up. Some deaf, dumb, blind. I don't
[1:25:27] know. Trouble is. Whatever your trouble
[1:25:28] is, come on. Give God a chance. Testify.
[1:25:31] Raise up. Don't be afraid. Don't be
[1:25:33] ashamed. Amen. You're ashamed. Uh you
[1:25:36] ashamed to testify. Come on. And while
[1:25:39] you're coming to give testimony of your
[1:25:43] uh of your rising, you people that
[1:25:46] raised your hands a while ago that you
[1:25:47] wanted to repent, you want to make your
[1:25:50] life right, come here and stand here
[1:25:52] just a minute. I want to pray for you.
[1:25:55] come right on up here and this way. You
[1:25:58] that raised your hands a while ago. You
[1:26:00] know, uh, and and you know
[1:26:04] that you want to come and thank God for
[1:26:07] taking that temper away from you, taking
[1:26:09] the world away from you, and you're not,
[1:26:11] you know, you're going to dress
[1:26:12] different, you're going to act
[1:26:13] different, you're going to live
[1:26:15] different. Come on up, be sincere, stand
[1:26:18] up, and come here to the altar.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Now, something happened. Now I want you
[1:26:24] to people to look here. I want you
[1:26:26] ministers. Can you see what tears the
[1:26:28] heart of a preacher? Can you see what
[1:26:31] tear tears the Holy Spirit? When people
[1:26:35] will raise their hands that they'll do
[1:26:37] that. They want to repent and then will
[1:26:39] sit there and won't move.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; All those people that raise their hands,
[1:26:46] they want to repent. They want to react.
[1:26:47] But he said, "Now that you you that did
[1:26:49] that now come up here." But they
[1:26:51] wouldn't do it.
[1:26:56] Let brother Bab says, "What's left but
[1:26:58] judgment?
[1:27:00] You'll cry someday when I'm gone. You'll
[1:27:02] remember that I speak in the name of
[1:27:03] Christ. You'll long to hear the things
[1:27:05] that you hear and you will never hear
[1:27:06] them. Come on now. I invite you to
[1:27:08] Christ." He says, "Was you ashamed? You
[1:27:11] are you ashamed? You raise your hand.
[1:27:14] Then you wouldn't make a good Christian
[1:27:17] to begin with." That's awful rude,
[1:27:19] brother. But it's time to take the
[1:27:20] gloves off and tell the truth. Christ is
[1:27:23] here. He's raised from the dead. He's
[1:27:24] present.
[1:27:26] Amen.
[1:27:28] Come on now. That's right. Raise up. If
[1:27:30] mama says sit down, say, "Mama, you go
[1:27:32] with me."
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; If husband says, "You can't go there or
[1:27:36] I'll leave you." Goodbye.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, you're going. Why? How many
[1:27:42] knows that we can't be ashamed of the
[1:27:43] gospel of Christ? We're not ashamed to
[1:27:46] suffer the reproach of Christ. Don't be
[1:27:48] ashamed [applause]
[1:27:50] to say that you know him. Count the
[1:27:53] cross. Take up your cross and follow
[1:27:55] him.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Imagine in [screaming] the Bible people
[1:27:58] were ashamed. The love of God come down
[1:28:00] and his parents their son was healed.
[1:28:02] Amen. Remember uh Jesus healed him of
[1:28:05] his you know blindness.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; The Pharisees come to him and they said
[1:28:12] how did he get his healing?
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; How did he get his healing? And them
[1:28:17] poor parents,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; them poor parents, they were ashamed
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; to testify that it was Jesus
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says that if they had
[1:28:29] that it was Jesus, they' have got cast
[1:28:31] out
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; of the synagogue. Isn't that right? So
[1:28:35] they say, "Well, he's of age. Ask him."
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can you imagine on the day of
[1:28:41] judgment Jesus come by and heal your
[1:28:44] very son? Ain't that right? And then you
[1:28:48] are ashamed to testify it was Christ
[1:28:50] that did it.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; No, that'll be played back.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; This is where you just because you're
[1:29:00] afraid to get kicked out of church, you
[1:29:02] won't stand for the truth that's
[1:29:04] presented for you before you.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like brother Bam says, if I taught
[1:29:10] that in our church, I'd get cast out.
[1:29:12] Well, you got to cast get cast out
[1:29:13] somewhere. Do you want to get cast out
[1:29:16] here or do you want to get cast out
[1:29:17] there? [applause]
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus says, "Whosoever will
[1:29:29] confess me before him, before men, him
[1:29:33] will I confess before my father which is
[1:29:35] in heaven, but whosoever will deny me,
[1:29:38] him will I also deny before my father
[1:29:41] which is in heaven."
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. He might come up saying,
[1:29:44] "We've cast out this. We've done that or
[1:29:46] the other, but somewhere along the line,
[1:29:48] you didn't obey. You didn't love him the
[1:29:50] way you were supposed to." Amen. Said,
[1:29:52] "Heaven haven't we all these works." And
[1:29:54] Jesus say, "I never knew you."
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Woo! What a powerful, horrible thing to
[1:30:01] have to hear from God on that day.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I never knew you. Depart from me, you
[1:30:09] workers of iniquity. I never had an
[1:30:11] intimate relationship with you. They
[1:30:14] believe this, as brother Bam says, we're
[1:30:15] like in a three- room house. Amen. We
[1:30:17] come to Christ. We're justified. Amen.
[1:30:19] We come into the living room. Amen. And
[1:30:21] we fellowship with him. But it's time
[1:30:23] for the bedroom. It's time for an
[1:30:25] intimate relationship with Almighty God
[1:30:27] to where you can get in your prayer
[1:30:29] [screaming] closet and you can talk to
[1:30:30] the Lord. But Abraham says every
[1:30:32] preacher ought to have it before he
[1:30:33] comes out here. He ought to have that
[1:30:35] time, that sweet time with the Lord,
[1:30:37] talking and fellowshipping with Almighty
[1:30:39] God.
[1:30:40] is we're not in the we're we don't have
[1:30:42] that out here. Amen. We're not in the
[1:30:44] outer courts. We're not in the holies of
[1:30:46] in the holies anymore. You and I are in
[1:30:48] the holies of holies. We enter into his
[1:30:51] rest.
[1:30:53] [applause]
[1:30:55] That's where you and I [screaming] are
[1:30:57] to be.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Evening light tabernacle.
[1:31:04] It's time to be ready.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; It's time to be ready. Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be hard,
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; but maybe we need to be hard.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Maybe I need to be harder.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I'll know what I know one thing. If
[1:31:25] you're a child of God, you'll be able to
[1:31:27] handle it.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, let me go a little
[1:31:31] further. You're going to love it
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; because you know that Jesus said, "As
[1:31:35] many as I love, I rebuke, I chasen. be
[1:31:38] zealous therefore [screaming] and
[1:31:40] repent. [applause and cheering] Why?
[1:31:42] Because we want to be without spot,
[1:31:44] without wrinkle. We want to be
[1:31:46] blameless. We want to have the peace of
[1:31:48] God in our hearts. How many is with me?
[1:31:50] Amen. This Christmas season. Amen. This
[1:31:52] is the season to have the peace of God,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; ruling and railing in your heart,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; to be without spot.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. to love him with all your heart,
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; all your mind, all your soul, all your
[1:32:07] strength.
[1:32:11] When I think about that, this is our
[1:32:14] time. Preachers have preached it, right?
[1:32:17] This is your time.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; This is our time.
[1:32:22] This is all of humanity's time.
[1:32:25] Everybody that's
[1:32:27] hears,
[1:32:29] let him hear what the spirit say to the
[1:32:31] churches.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is our time to make our
[1:32:35] choice. And we are a very privileged
[1:32:38] people. Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Young men, even me back in 1965 when
[1:32:51] brother Brandham preached the seagulls
[1:32:53] after that there was people that thought
[1:32:54] that mercy was over.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; No more mercy. Can you imagine the
[1:32:59] preacher telling you now it's over?
[1:33:02] You'd say, "My, I went in,
[1:33:06] right?"
[1:33:08] Different ones thinking that mercy was
[1:33:09] over with.
[1:33:11] Even brother Brandham made it sound like
[1:33:13] that almost. Could it be? Could it?
[1:33:16] We're preaching to the total loss. Souls
[1:33:18] in prison now is scary,
[1:33:23] but amen.
[1:33:26] Should preachers quit preaching, go off
[1:33:28] the field, they ask him. He said, 'N no,
[1:33:31] it's not time to quit yet. We're not
[1:33:33] done yet. Keep preaching the gospel.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? I'm glad. Why? Because
[1:33:39] I'd have been out, but I'm not. So, I'm
[1:33:41] thankful for the grace of God. The mercy
[1:33:44] of God is still available.
[1:33:46] Oh, it'll stop one of these days. It'll
[1:33:48] be cut off when he rises from that mercy
[1:33:50] seat.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you think, Brother Bram
[1:33:57] said? He says, "If you're listening to
[1:33:59] this tape right now and you need to
[1:34:01] repent and get right with God, push
[1:34:03] stop."
[1:34:05] Amen. One time we can say, "Not push
[1:34:07] play, but push stop." Young people, if
[1:34:10] you're not right with God, push stop.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm not leaving this church
[1:34:14] service until I'm right with God. Until
[1:34:17] I know I've got the peace of God in
[1:34:19] [screaming] my heart, until I know he's
[1:34:21] forgiven me."
[1:34:23] Stop everything until that happens. Then
[1:34:26] push play. then listen to the rest.
[1:34:29] [applause and cheering]
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; If it was that urgent back then, can you
[1:34:33] imagine where we are now?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; I read that scripture there because
[1:34:39] guess what? We are absolutely, brother
[1:34:41] Bam says it's it's the coming of the
[1:34:43] Lord is passed due. Didn't he say that
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; it's passed due? [screaming]
[1:34:48] There's only one thing hindering the
[1:34:50] rapture, and that's the readiness of the
[1:34:52] bride.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Think about it, y'all.
[1:34:58] God, help me not to be the hindrance.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Don't help me to hold Don't let me hold
[1:35:02] it back.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; How many is left with me? God, don't let
[1:35:06] me hold it back. I want to be ready.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; I told my wife on the way to church
[1:35:11] here, he I said, you know,
[1:35:17] well, I don't know if I said told her
[1:35:18] just this way, but this is the way I
[1:35:20] thought it.
[1:35:22] I'm not expecting a tomorrow.
[1:35:25] I don't expect tomorrow to happen.
[1:35:33] No,
[1:35:34] I expect God to come here today before
[1:35:38] the day is done.
[1:35:40] Amen.
[1:35:42] I live I want to live my life like he's
[1:35:46] coming today.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I told my wife, I said, "But
[1:35:53] we have to plan like he's not coming for
[1:35:55] 50 years."
[1:35:58] Imagine that. Not expecting a tomorrow,
[1:36:00] but yet you got to keep on living your
[1:36:02] life.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You said, "Is that what
[1:36:05] Brother Brand taught?"
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; That's what he taught.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Why? Because you can't
[1:36:11] quit. You can't stop.
[1:36:14] I think brother Tommy put it on on on
[1:36:18] the group talking about
[1:36:21] if the Lord if let let's say we seen
[1:36:23] some of our loved ones
[1:36:26] and we say we got about 30 days left.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; We got about 30 days left.
[1:36:34] What would you change?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; What would you change?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:44] And I would hope that you can say
[1:36:46] nothing.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense to you?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Sure. Nothing. Why? Because you're doing
[1:36:58] just what you're supposed to be doing.
[1:37:01] You're living the way you're supposed to
[1:37:02] be living. If not, then you need to
[1:37:04] repent.
[1:37:06] Then you need to make a change. If
[1:37:08] you're not doing what you're supposed to
[1:37:09] be doing,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; try to get others in. Try to get as many
[1:37:13] in as possible, living for the Lord,
[1:37:16] reflecting Christ.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, if you're building a
[1:37:20] church, keep building a church. If you
[1:37:22] know he's coming tomorrow, keep on doing
[1:37:23] whatever it is God's called you to do.
[1:37:26] How many wants to be in that place? I
[1:37:27] want to be in the place God has called
[1:37:29] me to be. Stand there. Don't deviate.
[1:37:32] Don't fluctuate.
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:37] Amen. Chris Kathy even come talk about
[1:37:39] Amen be stable unmovable because why he
[1:37:42] apparently crows around and so many
[1:37:43] people leaving and Amen falling back and
[1:37:46] and going here and there unstable. Don't
[1:37:48] be that way.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; No. If there's ever a time to stand,
[1:37:51] it's a now. If there ever a time to be
[1:37:54] solid in Christ, it's now. If there's
[1:37:56] ever a time to be without spot, it's
[1:37:58] now.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Why? because we know that this world is
[1:38:02] coming to an end
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; and we're going to leave this place by
[1:38:06] God's grace
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; and with his help
[1:38:10] and we need a greater love of God
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; in our hearts. Lord Jesus, I want a
[1:38:17] greater love.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; There's no eye has seen nor ear heard
[1:38:23] the things that God has prepared for
[1:38:25] them. This is one place where he says
[1:38:27] them that love him.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; How many loves him?
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many wants to be pleasing to
[1:38:36] him?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; I think I'm going to just bring a couple
[1:38:39] of those scriptures in how that you can
[1:38:41] know that you're pleasing to him and how
[1:38:43] that you love him.
[1:38:49] Amen.
[1:38:51] Because that's what we want to be. We
[1:38:52] want to be like Enoch. He had this
[1:38:54] testimony
[1:38:55] that he did what?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; That he pleased
[1:39:01] God.
[1:39:03] Amen.
[1:39:06] In John.
[1:39:11] Come on now.
[1:39:14] supposed to put this
[1:39:18] John 2.
[1:39:23] Hereby know we that we know him
[1:39:26] if we keep his commandments.
[1:39:32] Now, how many know is that we're not
[1:39:34] saved
[1:39:36] by keeping his commandments
[1:39:40] by the works of the law?
[1:39:44] That doesn't save you. We're saved by
[1:39:47] grace through faith.
[1:39:49] That not of yourselves. It's the gift of
[1:39:51] God.
[1:39:53] We're saved. And we do these things.
[1:39:56] Jesus said, "If you love me,
[1:39:59] keep my commandments."
[1:40:01] There's a lot of people, Amish and all
[1:40:04] these different ones, they think that if
[1:40:05] they dress a certain way, they drive a
[1:40:07] horse and buggy. Like brother Joe said
[1:40:09] this morning, I sure glad I didn't have
[1:40:11] to drive a buggy this morning.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; If I suffer and I don't have an air
[1:40:16] conditioner and I don't have electricity
[1:40:18] and I really I'm not conformed to the
[1:40:21] world in the way that the world does.
[1:40:23] Hello. I mean their whole religion is
[1:40:25] almost on based on that. What about the
[1:40:28] transforming of your mind?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:40:33] However, what it what it is, brothers
[1:40:36] and sisters, is to think about this.
[1:40:39] We do it out of love, don't we?
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Because we don't want to hurt him.
[1:40:43] Brother Bram many times made the
[1:40:45] statement and he give us the
[1:40:47] illustration of how that whenever he
[1:40:49] leaves to go to another country, he'll
[1:40:51] get up and with his wife and his
[1:40:53] children and they'll pray together and
[1:40:56] she'll he'll tell her that she loves
[1:40:57] him. I mean [laughter]
[1:40:59] that he loves her and she'll tell him
[1:41:01] that she loves him and
[1:41:06] she don't come up to him say now Mr.
[1:41:08] Brandon, you I'm telling you, you better
[1:41:10] be faithful and don't you have no mother
[1:41:13] wives up other than me. While I'm gone,
[1:41:16] honey, you better not have no other. No,
[1:41:17] but says you don't have to do all that.
[1:41:20] He said, because the love that he has
[1:41:22] for her, he wouldn't want to hurt her
[1:41:23] for nothing. How many feels that way?
[1:41:26] That's what we want. God, we don't want
[1:41:29] to hurt you for nothing.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I believe in
[1:41:35] evening light tabernacle saints being
[1:41:38] led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Sure, I'm your leader in in in his
[1:41:43] perspective of guiding and so forth, but
[1:41:45] brother Bram clearly said in the in the
[1:41:47] church ages and so forth that the church
[1:41:49] is meant to be led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Because if you're just led by me, you'll
[1:41:55] just try to do it because Thomas said
[1:41:57] not to.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:42:01] We could say that about our children.
[1:42:03] Godspeed today that they don't do it
[1:42:05] just because we tell them they can't.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; They'll come and they'll say, "I don't
[1:42:09] do it because I don't want to do it."
[1:42:10] How many thankful for a desire not to do
[1:42:13] it?
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; I thank God for his grace this morning.
[1:42:18] [applause]
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; I thank him for his grace. How many
[1:42:23] thankful for his grace?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; I thank him for his love.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; And I thank him for his grace.
[1:42:33] Now notice here and he says he that
[1:42:35] saith I know him and keepeth not his
[1:42:38] commandments is a liar
[1:42:41] and the truth is not in him.
[1:42:44] In whosoever keepeth his word in him
[1:42:46] verily is the love of God perfected.
[1:42:49] Amen. And hereby know we that we are in
[1:42:53] him. Amen. When your heart's desire is
[1:42:57] to please God and do what he says, John
[1:43:01] says, "That's how we know that we know
[1:43:03] him."
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; You have all kinds of churches and
[1:43:08] different people that'll uh live a
[1:43:10] certain way during the week and then
[1:43:11] come to church and go out and get drunk
[1:43:13] and everything else. Come and raise your
[1:43:15] hands. I love him. I bunch of liars.
[1:43:20] How many believes that if we truly love
[1:43:22] him, we'll want to do what God says.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; How many is with me? Lord, help me to do
[1:43:29] everything that he tells me to do.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, convict me of those little things.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; It's time to get the little things
[1:43:37] right. How many believe it?
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh my. Aren't you glad for
[1:43:42] the grace of God?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. His great, his mercy, his
[1:43:46] longsuffering. Think about it. 12 years
[1:43:50] that he gave the days of Noah for them
[1:43:52] to get right with God. Here he says, "We
[1:43:54] are living in the long suffering of
[1:43:57] almighty God." The prophet way back in
[1:43:59] 65 passed away. Amen. And now look how
[1:44:02] long it's been since he's went off the
[1:44:04] scene.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And God Oh, he he thought he wouldn't
[1:44:08] go. Remember I read Sunday he says
[1:44:10] scientists say that within 10 years the
[1:44:12] whole world is going to be annihilated.
[1:44:15] scientist.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram thought for sure we'd be
[1:44:19] gone and done and over with and that
[1:44:20] we'd be walking.
[1:44:22] How many is looking forward to walking
[1:44:24] in the millennium?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm looking forward to He thought we
[1:44:27] would have be if I should in the
[1:44:29] millennium ready by 1977.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Caleb wasn't even born then.
[1:44:36] Huh?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Didn't get married till
[1:44:40] 83.
[1:44:41] Didn't get saved till around 80 or
[1:44:43] something like that.
[1:44:44] Praise the Lord. How many glad for his
[1:44:46] longsuffering? God is longsuffering.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about his grace. In closing,
[1:44:53] [applause]
[1:44:57] how many do we have in here that's
[1:44:58] perfect?
[1:45:01] You do everything right.
[1:45:04] Never make a mistake.
[1:45:08] Huh?
[1:45:10] Now, let me ask you this. What if God
[1:45:12] wouldn't have mercy and grace for you?
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; How many of us still be here?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; But I thank God for his grace. For his
[1:45:21] mercy.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; I thank God that before you go to bed,
[1:45:24] you can do like brother Bam said, Billy
[1:45:26] Paul, confess all your sins, get
[1:45:27] everything right. You don't know whether
[1:45:28] you're going to wake up in the morning
[1:45:30] or not.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; How many glad that we can come and say,
[1:45:32] "God, I'm not." But I know your grace
[1:45:35] covers it and I'm striving for that
[1:45:36] perfection. How many striving for that
[1:45:38] perfection?
[1:45:42] Amen.
[1:45:45] I I don't know. I guess I could say it.
[1:45:48] Maybe shouldn't doubt it. Don't. But
[1:45:51] sometimes preachers come up here and
[1:45:52] says, "You'll never be perfect." Make it
[1:45:54] sound like why even try? Hello. But what
[1:45:58] is the five-fold ministry for?
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; It's for striving for that perfecting of
[1:46:04] the saints. Somebody ain't preaching
[1:46:06] right. [applause] Why? because we're
[1:46:08] trying to bring people to perfection to
[1:46:11] that place.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; All right. I've read it. I don't have
[1:46:17] the quote with me, but I've read it
[1:46:18] where brother Brandham said what
[1:46:19] perfection was. He says it's when you
[1:46:22] are daily living for him and you make a
[1:46:25] mistake.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; You do something wrong and you quickly
[1:46:28] confess it. He said you're still perfect
[1:46:30] in the sight of God.
[1:46:34] [applause]
[1:46:37] Amen. That's what he said. I take his
[1:46:39] word for it.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; How many glad because man, if you uh if
[1:46:43] you made a mistake and did something
[1:46:44] wrong and say, "Well, now I got to get
[1:46:46] rebaptized. I ain't a child of God." And
[1:46:49] no, no, don't do that. Just get right,
[1:46:51] repent, say, "God, forgive me." And get
[1:46:53] right back up. He says, "You're in the
[1:46:55] eyes of God, you're perfect." Why?
[1:46:57] Because you're walking in the blood.
[1:46:59] You're under the blood. [applause]
[1:47:04] That's the grace of God.
[1:47:07] How many know, oh, if I could tell the
[1:47:09] world, if I could tell our government,
[1:47:10] if I could tell Russia, if I could tell
[1:47:12] China, if I could tell the world this
[1:47:14] morning, you are living by the grace of
[1:47:17] God. It is the grace of God that you're
[1:47:20] not burnt up already.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; You're living living in the mercy of
[1:47:24] Almighty God. You're living in the
[1:47:26] longsuffering, the goodness of God.
[1:47:30] There's how many knows for 2,000 years
[1:47:32] that blood has been over the earth,
[1:47:34] hasn't it? He said the only thing that
[1:47:36] keeps God in the wrath of God, amen, to
[1:47:38] destroy this world is that blood
[1:47:40] covering. That's the mercy of God.
[1:47:43] That's the grace of God. Amen. And
[1:47:45] that's what the world is living under.
[1:47:47] And they don't even realize it, but you
[1:47:49] and I realize it. And we thank God for
[1:47:52] it. Say, "Thank you, Lord, for your
[1:47:54] grace for me. Let that blood wash me
[1:47:56] white." Even brother Brandham's patience
[1:47:59] got short when he was up in Ohio in that
[1:48:01] restaurant and seen all of those people
[1:48:03] dancing and everything else and and a
[1:48:05] policeman playing a slot machine that
[1:48:06] was even illegal. He says, "God, why
[1:48:08] don't you just destroy this thing?" God
[1:48:10] says, "Come over here behind this door.
[1:48:12] I got to talk to you a little bit."
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; He come over there and he showed him all
[1:48:15] of his faults. Every time that his
[1:48:17] faults would come up there, Amen. Amen.
[1:48:19] There was a there would be like a
[1:48:21] bumper. It would hit that and it would
[1:48:23] go on a book. It would go on a book.
[1:48:25] Amen. He had a whole big book full of
[1:48:27] sins. Ain't that right? Amen. And Jesus
[1:48:30] grabs hands that Amen. he wrote on that
[1:48:32] book, pardoned.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Pardoned. He says, "I pardoned you, but
[1:48:37] you want to be condemning everybody
[1:48:39] else." Hallelujah. How many knows I want
[1:48:42] to say to the world, there's a pardon
[1:48:44] for you. [applause and cheering]
[1:48:46] Everybody, the whole world, there's a
[1:48:48] pardon for everybody. Whosoever will,
[1:48:51] let him come.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Let him come. [screaming]
[1:48:56] Come while you can
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; or you will later regret it and say,
[1:49:00] "Boy, I wished I would have." Just like
[1:49:02] all those that are in the regions of the
[1:49:04] lost.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; They wished they would have. Elvis
[1:49:07] wishes he would have. The rich man
[1:49:08] wishes he would have.
[1:49:11] But wishing doesn't do you any good
[1:49:12] anymore over there. [sighs]
[1:49:17] [gasps]
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] This fits this generation.
[1:49:28] As many as I love, Revelations 3
[1:49:31] 19 somewhere in there. He says, "As many
[1:49:33] as I love, I rebuke, I chasen. Besell
[1:49:37] us, therefore, and repent." Proverbs
[1:49:39] 1:23 says, "Turn you at my reproof.
[1:49:43] Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
[1:49:45] you. I will make known my words unto
[1:49:48] you." I thought of the message of the
[1:49:50] hour. How many believes that this
[1:49:51] message will produce a bride? We've
[1:49:53] already got the words that we need to
[1:49:55] get out of here. God has given us his
[1:49:58] words. I have made known my words unto
[1:50:01] you.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; You're not in dark ages anymore. No,
[1:50:04] you're in perfect light.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Back to Paul's what he said. Back what
[1:50:09] the Bible says. Turn at my reproof. But
[1:50:12] because I called and you refused, I
[1:50:14] stretched out my hand. No man regarded.
[1:50:18] But you have said it not all my counsel
[1:50:20] and would not of my reproof.
[1:50:22] reproof. I also will laugh at your
[1:50:25] calamity. I will mock when your fear
[1:50:27] cometh. Why? They mocked him.
[1:50:32] But guess what? God gets the last mock.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God gets the last laugh.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not mocked. What a man sws
[1:50:42] that will he also reap.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; When your calamity comes, I will mock
[1:50:46] you when your fear cometh. When your
[1:50:48] fear cometh as desolation, your
[1:50:50] destruction cometh asth a whirlwind,
[1:50:52] distress and anguish cometh upon you. Oh
[1:50:56] my, how many knows? You can almost
[1:50:58] imagine the condition and the anguish
[1:51:00] and the horror that this world is about
[1:51:02] to face. We serve a loving God. That God
[1:51:06] is love.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'll tell you what, there's
[1:51:09] another side to God. And he don't want
[1:51:11] to do it, but he has to to be just.
[1:51:14] Our
[1:51:16] justice system is absolutely no good.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Buy their way out.
[1:51:23] When's the last time? Well, I won't
[1:51:25] bring political people, but you know
[1:51:27] some names that ought to be in jail.
[1:51:30] You do something like that, you're going
[1:51:32] to jail.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; I haven't seen any of our politicians go
[1:51:36] to jail and they deserve to. Trump
[1:51:38] probably did to be honest with you.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:51:43] But how I said that to say this that he
[1:51:47] is a just judge.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; He will bring justice. He is a just God.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You mock him, you'll get what you
[1:51:57] got coming.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; You refuse him, you'll get it. Amen.
[1:52:03] Oh my. Then shall they call upon me, but
[1:52:06] I will not answer.
[1:52:09] I wonder, God forbid anybody under the
[1:52:12] sound of my voice will ever come to the
[1:52:13] place to where you'll remember that you
[1:52:15] heard that. I'll call, but God won't let
[1:52:19] answer.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; How many knows God is calling now?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; We heard him just a few minutes. Come
[1:52:26] unto me all ye who are weary and be
[1:52:27] ready. Come, come, come. Christ is
[1:52:30] calling. Come.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Sure, he's calling now. The spirit and
[1:52:34] the bride say, "Come." Amen.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; But then they shall call on me and I
[1:52:38] will not answer. They'll seek me early
[1:52:40] but I shall not. They shall not find me.
[1:52:43] They hated knowledge.
[1:52:46] Truth presented right to people and they
[1:52:49] turn it away.
[1:52:52] There's just about nothing worse that
[1:52:53] you can do when you know something's the
[1:52:55] truth than turn it away. And did not
[1:52:58] choose to fear of the Lord. They would
[1:53:00] none of my counsel. They despised all my
[1:53:02] reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the
[1:53:05] fruit of their own way. This is what you
[1:53:08] wanted. This is what you chose. Now eat
[1:53:12] it.
[1:53:17] And they will be filled with their own
[1:53:18] devices. For the turning away of the
[1:53:21] simple shall slay them, and the
[1:53:22] prosperity of fool shall destroy them.
[1:53:24] But whoso hallelujah.
[1:53:27] Have we got any whoos?
[1:53:30] Whosoever hearkenth unto me shall not
[1:53:32] shall dwell safely and shall be quiet
[1:53:34] from all evil.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; How many glad that you heard his voice?
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [applause]
[1:53:43] Thank you, Lord, that we heard your
[1:53:45] voice.
[1:53:48] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:53:53] I got to quit, but I'm going to say this
[1:53:55] in closing. Paul last chapter of Acts
[1:53:57] when he was preaching some believed the
[1:53:59] things that were spoken and some
[1:54:01] believed not and when they agreed not
[1:54:03] amongst themselves they departed
[1:54:05] couldn't come to an agreement after that
[1:54:07] Paul spoke a word well spake the Holy
[1:54:10] Ghost saying well spake the Holy Ghost
[1:54:12] by Isaiah's the prophet unto your
[1:54:14] fathers saying go unto this people and
[1:54:17] say hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:54:20] understand and seeing you shall see and
[1:54:22] shall not perceive for the heart of this
[1:54:25] people is waxed gross and their ears are
[1:54:27] dull of hearing and their eyes have they
[1:54:30] closed least they should see with their
[1:54:31] eyes
[1:54:33] and hear with their ears and understand
[1:54:36] with their heart. Do you want to know
[1:54:39] what happens when somebody sees when
[1:54:41] somebody understands with their heart
[1:54:43] and should be converted
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; and I would heal them.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed are your eyes for
[1:54:51] they see. Blessed are your ears.
[1:54:53] [screaming] You're a blessed person this
[1:54:55] morning. We're a blessed people. The
[1:54:58] grace of almighty God that let's put
[1:55:01] something down in your heart to be able
[1:55:03] to believe. You can't make people
[1:55:04] believe. It takes the grace of God to
[1:55:07] open their eyes. [screaming]
[1:55:09] [applause]
[1:55:10] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord for your
[1:55:12] grace. Thank you Lord for your love.
[1:55:17] Oh this is the greatest treasure that we
[1:55:19] have is to come together on Sunday
[1:55:21] morning. Amen. with believers of like
[1:55:23] faith. Amen. And saturate ourselves in
[1:55:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:55:28] Believing the word of God. Welcome him
[1:55:31] down into our hearts saying, "Lord, I
[1:55:34] want to love you more.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; I want to love him more. Don't you?"
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; He gets sweeter, sweeter, sweeter,
[1:55:46] sweeter, sweeter as the day go by.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] I love him more and more and more. I
[1:55:53] want more of Jesus than I ever had
[1:55:56] before.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I want more of Jesus.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; I want more. I want so much. Brother
[1:56:02] Brad, stand up with me. Amen. I want so
[1:56:04] much. One day we're going to hug.
[1:56:05] Embrace Christ. We're going to give him
[1:56:08] a hug. How many believe that? We're
[1:56:09] going to see him face to face. Amen.
[1:56:12] That's what we want to do.
[1:56:15] Embrace him. Say, "God, we want to we
[1:56:17] want to hold you. We want to hug you. We
[1:56:19] want to love you more
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; and we're looking forward to the time
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; when we can.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. How many loves what
[1:56:31] Christ did for us on Calvary?
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; How he came to the earth this Christmas
[1:56:37] season, became a man
[1:56:41] and reconciled us. How many's
[1:56:43] reconciled?
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; There you go. I like to see them young
[1:56:46] hands up. you're reconciled
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; to God.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Keep that love of God in your heart.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Don't never let the devil put a little
[1:56:55] hatred or bitterness in there.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Just keep the love of God. It's the most
[1:56:59] important thing that you and I have is
[1:57:01] the love of God. Brother Bam says all of
[1:57:03] your religious demonstrations, all of
[1:57:04] that. Don't don't even worry about all
[1:57:06] that. He says, "You've got to have that
[1:57:08] perfect love in your heart." Paul said,
[1:57:10] "If I move mountains and all these
[1:57:11] things, if I have not charity, I'm
[1:57:12] nothing." Paul realized the importance
[1:57:15] that God's people Amen. that they have
[1:57:17] the love of God in their hearts.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Stand with me
[1:57:24] this morning. We'll just go into the
[1:57:25] communion. Remembering the Lord what he
[1:57:27] did? This do in remembrance of me. How
[1:57:30] many believes it's important to do it.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't do it, there's something
[1:57:34] wrong.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Need to be able to be at a place
[1:57:38] where you can do it. If not, get right
[1:57:41] with God so that you can turn your
[1:57:42] Bibles if with me if you will and read.
[1:57:44] We'll read the scriptures.
[1:57:47] We read a scripture here in 1
[1:57:49] Corinthians
[1:57:51] I believe 11.
