[0:00] I don't know if we have it we probably
[0:01] don't but amen I I guess way back time I
[0:05] remember it back when I was Mennonite I
[0:08] guess I heard whoa words beautiful words
[0:11] wonderful words of life amen there's a
[0:15] song about the wonderful words of life
[0:17] amen and so we come to church to have
[0:20] eight words that are alive their spirit
[0:23] and they are life
[0:28] amen praise the Lord
[0:31] originally when I began to think about
[0:33] this I begin to think about how that uh
[0:37] brother Branham he mentions now I think
[0:39] he even mentions brother Brian or
[0:41] brother Bosworth expressing this and
[0:44] you'll see it here so I'll start with
[0:46] this now here's now he's more willing to
[0:48] do it than you are to receive it see
[0:51] uh could you imagine brother Bosworth
[0:54] expressing this to this ocean out here
[0:56] piled up in one tube about two foot high
[1:00] or about two foot across he says in
[1:02] other words the whole Ocean's out there
[1:04] and then you have a pike about two foot
[1:07] wide two foot across he says what a
[1:10] pressure there would be trying to get
[1:13] down into that little kravis Amen to
[1:16] leak through now divide that by ten
[1:19] thousand times and you'll find the
[1:21] pressure of the Holy Spirit trying to
[1:24] find that little crevice in the heart
[1:28] amen that true Faith to leak in there
[1:31] and to heal you
[1:33] now I know no matter what the promises
[1:35] of God are God is more willing and
[1:39] Desiring to give it to us than what we
[1:42] are to receive it
[1:44] and before the service is over tonight
[1:46] by the help of the Lord I want to show
[1:47] you I want to tell you how you can get
[1:50] more because that's what I want to talk
[1:51] about a little bit I mean how that we
[1:53] can take that two foot or whatever crack
[1:55] or whatever crevice you might just have
[1:56] a little little bit of Faith whatever it
[1:59] is and that we can expand the reception
[2:02] of being able to receive more of God
[2:06] because how many we've got untapped
[2:08] resources amen there's like a whole
[2:10] ocean up there and he's trying God is
[2:13] trying
[2:15] boy we need to get this he's trying to
[2:17] get into you more
[2:19] he's trying to get into me more
[2:26] amen and we're gonna find out by the end
[2:30] of the service how to do that how can we
[2:31] again get more amen
[2:33] praise the Lord
[2:35] oh my when I think about it okay so now
[2:38] notice and he goes on to talking about
[2:40] he says you know like somebody came and
[2:43] told him he says uh people tell me he
[2:45] says you know I would ask God to heal me
[2:47] but you know he's so busy
[2:49] then by the band says my could you
[2:51] imagine the little fish about ye long
[2:53] out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean
[2:56] saying now I better just drink this
[2:58] water sparingly
[2:59] amen
[3:01] or I might run out someday
[3:04] this has a hahaha there
[3:09] that's right that's just as intelligent
[3:12] thinking that you could ever exhaust
[3:14] God's goodness to you amen could you
[3:18] imagine little mouse down there under
[3:19] the big old grains Garner Egypt saying I
[3:23] just better eat two grains a day
[3:26] it might not last through the winter
[3:31] Oh my he wants you to ask abundantly so
[3:35] your Joys might be full amen don't be
[3:38] afraid to ask God for anything he's
[3:40] willing more willing to give it than you
[3:43] are to receive it
[3:48] now I'm going to show you also in what
[3:51] ways we're not willing to receive it is
[3:54] that okay
[3:56] so don't let me forget
[3:59] because I'm forgetful
[4:01] amen
[4:03] praise the Lord
[4:08] another one just to start with
[4:13] well let me finish this one first
[4:15] so he thought he's more willing to give
[4:17] it
[4:18] now so now notice right after this right
[4:20] after that the next quote he says so God
[4:22] has a way for us God loves his children
[4:25] he loves his people he wants to help him
[4:27] he wants to help you more than you want
[4:31] help
[4:32] if you can just get that in your heart
[4:35] that God's more willing to help you than
[4:38] you are to help yourself
[4:43] his Lord help us
[4:45] right don't you just be like oh my
[4:47] goodness he's more willing to help me
[4:49] and I'm willing to help myself I thought
[4:51] I was pretty willing to help myself
[4:56] I don't understand it I don't care but
[4:58] that's what he said
[5:01] and perhaps what I tell you later on and
[5:04] what keeps us from God and so forth will
[5:06] also tie into this
[5:08] to where we're not just so willing to
[5:10] let God help us
[5:14] amen
[5:16] all right
[5:17] praise the Lord
[5:20] so now notice more willing than you are
[5:23] to help yourself
[5:24] but he has a way
[5:27] and that's the only way that he'll work
[5:31] is through his way
[5:36] you must come to his terms
[5:40] his terms
[5:42] you wanted a certain way but he wants to
[5:44] give it to you his way
[5:49] amen
[5:51] dipping in Jordan remember you told him
[5:54] to go dipping money this ain't there
[5:56] enough around here
[5:58] that I can dip around here without to
[6:01] the Papa told him and his servant said
[6:02] now if he'd ask you a hard thing you'd
[6:04] have done that right but it just asked
[6:06] you a simple thing going dead and he
[6:08] went and he did what the prophet said
[6:10] how many knows he could have dipped in a
[6:12] dozen of them he'd never got cleansed to
[6:14] leprosy
[6:16] never
[6:24] foreign
[6:28] you can try all kinds of ways but you'll
[6:32] never get it until you come this way
[6:35] till you come guys what's the only way
[6:37] God won't compromise for you
[6:40] amen
[6:41] that's the way you come that way or you
[6:43] don't come
[6:45] praise be to God
[6:47] all people have tried it every other way
[6:49] they climb up some other way the Bible
[6:51] says
[6:52] amen
[6:54] all right
[6:56] now notice so he had to obey and come
[7:00] God's way and when he fully obeyed God's
[7:03] way the leprosy left and I say tonight
[7:06] that if we obey God's provided way
[7:09] leprosy will
[7:12] sickness will leave everything will
[7:15] leave
[7:18] everything
[7:20] let me know it doesn't matter what you
[7:22] have need of whatever you desire ask if
[7:24] you believe with all of your heart come
[7:26] the right way
[7:28] and then there'll be a finished work
[7:32] oh my but we've got to come his way for
[7:36] this day amen praise the Lord
[7:42] now notice Brother Band says another
[7:45] thing about an eagle he's a special bird
[7:48] because he will never build his nest on
[7:50] the ground
[7:51] he built it his nest way higher he
[7:54] Likens that to his church you are a city
[7:56] that sits on a hill not in the valley
[7:58] you're a city that sits on a hill that
[8:01] can be seen a fire off and lighted
[8:04] candle that can be seen far off
[8:07] the church is setting high with high
[8:09] expectations High ambitions
[8:13] amen
[8:15] how many knows that somebody that
[8:17] doesn't have very high Ambitions in this
[8:19] life won't get very far
[8:23] man you got to work in slave and hard
[8:24] you got to have some Ambitions if you're
[8:26] going to get anywhere
[8:28] a lot of people will just well just
[8:30] whatever
[8:31] [Music]
[8:33] let me tell you something when you're
[8:34] looking for a boy when you're looking
[8:35] for a girl you better have some
[8:36] expectations from them are you going to
[8:38] get somebody that ain't no good
[8:42] have some expectations
[8:45] have some high expectations amen
[8:47] brother says I haven't gotten much hopes
[8:49] for a pastor's church that has got high
[8:52] got Ambitions to better themselves day
[8:55] by day year by year
[9:00] let me believe that's what it's all
[9:01] about that's right a church that's
[9:04] really a Church of the Living God will
[9:06] never just stop and say like I said a
[9:09] couple weeks ago well I'm at a certain
[9:10] Plateau I guess that's just where I'll
[9:12] stay
[9:13] huh
[9:14] never just stop and say well I just come
[9:16] in I guess it's all right now that ain't
[9:19] the Church of God You've Got High
[9:23] oh my
[9:24] you might say I've done my part I
[9:26] brought one sinner in last year he got
[9:28] saved brother that's not the ambition of
[9:31] the church that's been another one and
[9:33] then another one another then another
[9:35] then another that's right to it
[9:39] praise be to God
[9:41] High Ambitions the better ourselves
[9:46] that's what we're here for tonight
[9:48] to see how we
[9:50] can better ourselves not staying in the
[9:53] same place growing higher and higher and
[9:57] higher
[9:58] all right let's go to the quote where I
[10:00] wanted to start
[10:02] now
[10:04] this is an invisible Union of Christ in
[10:07] the bride and it was after I read about
[10:09] you're Washed by the bleeding word
[10:11] you're the Spotless sinless
[10:13] bride of Jesus Christ and he makes a
[10:15] statement you're perfect
[10:17] amen
[10:18] then after that he says something that I
[10:21] didn't get to the other day and I wanted
[10:22] to get to that we're going to go from
[10:24] here nine closing I might say this that
[10:28] we know that the modern Church
[10:30] Pentecostal in its present condition and
[10:33] all the denominations together I throw
[10:35] them all in one one bundle because they
[10:38] are
[10:39] amen
[10:41] and we know where the bundles are going
[10:45] all right you know where the bundles are
[10:47] going
[10:48] again the next statement the next next
[10:51] uh uh quote he says that almost three or
[10:54] four times we all know
[10:57] 39 5 if it goes the same way it does
[11:00] here
[11:01] we all know that the modern Church in
[11:04] its present condition and its state is
[11:06] in no condition to finish up the Great
[11:10] Commission that God gave his church
[11:13] my title tonight is finishing the
[11:15] commission
[11:16] finishing the commission
[11:20] amen
[11:22] they can't
[11:24] yeah
[11:25] Instagram
[11:26] Great Commission
[11:28] [Laughter]
[11:31] he just got finished saying we all know
[11:33] that the modern Church
[11:35] and
[11:36] pick also in his present condition and
[11:39] all the nominations I throw them all
[11:40] they can't never meet the conditions
[11:45] you see brother banham I mean no he
[11:47] turned a corner in 1963. there was a
[11:50] time when he sent him into there send
[11:52] them into there there was a time when he
[11:53] could get out of there
[11:55] you can't belong to one of them churches
[11:57] and be the Bride of Jesus Christ just in
[11:59] case anybody's wondering right you can't
[12:02] be the Bride of Jesus Christ and belong
[12:03] to one of the man-made denominations
[12:08] you can't never finish up the commission
[12:10] and that some of those things I wanna
[12:12] look
[12:14] at what that commission is and so forth
[12:17] now we know all right now notice
[12:21] notice how it says they're in Ephesians
[12:23] here we come all to the unity of the
[12:25] faith is that right and to the knowledge
[12:28] of the Son of God until there's under
[12:31] United and wonder under one hit and so
[12:34] forth one Lord One Faith one baptism
[12:37] he said we've got one that's two in the
[12:40] three in this first fight this one's
[12:42] this and that one's out and every one of
[12:44] them afraid to face the word right down
[12:46] to the test amen you can tell them about
[12:49] it and they say I can't help but I can't
[12:50] believe it I don't care what it does
[12:53] amen
[12:54] people said well I don't believe that
[12:55] even though the Bible says it well that
[12:57] you just put yourself out
[12:59] my own church don't teach this or that
[13:02] or the other amen my goodness
[13:05] now we know again he says it now we know
[13:08] that the church depending calls the
[13:10] church by no means
[13:12] oh means could carry out and he says it
[13:16] and the reason I'm saying it again
[13:17] because he says it's a little bit
[13:18] different
[13:19] by no means could carry out the Last Day
[13:22] message
[13:24] amen
[13:26] The Last Day message in its present
[13:29] condition not good
[13:31] no
[13:32] why can't you see
[13:34] denominations out
[13:37] that's right and it's going to be it's
[13:40] going to be
[13:44] elected people that's elected for it
[13:49] aren't you glad that you can believe the
[13:52] message of the hour if you're a message
[13:54] believer
[13:57] amen that put you in the category of
[13:59] being able to finish out this commission
[14:01] and no and so every one of us know that
[14:04] the whole rank of denominations Clinic
[14:09] Apostles and all are dead and he was
[14:13] talking to me Born Again Christians of
[14:17] the message
[14:19] Gotta Die out to all of that
[14:22] to be a message believer is that the
[14:25] truth
[14:26] that's why I see your first husband's
[14:28] dead you know he said God let it die I
[14:32] mean we got to die to that old thing
[14:35] I do traditions of man and so forth
[14:40] that never even
[14:44] what
[14:45] it's man-made Creeds mod man-made dogmas
[14:49] they can't never fulfill the scripture
[14:52] where it says man shall not live but
[14:54] right alone but by every word that
[14:55] proceed is out of the mouth of God
[14:58] no they add to it they can't fulfill
[15:01] Rebel that they actually do fulfill
[15:02] Revelations where it says don't you add
[15:04] one word to it or take one word away
[15:06] they add to it
[15:08] they fulfill that part
[15:13] oh my dick cat uh they can't fulfill
[15:16] Ephesians 5 and 26 and 27 where he's
[15:19] coming for a bride for a church that's
[15:22] washed that's without spot and that's
[15:24] without Regal they have homosexual
[15:26] preachers they're filthy they're dirty
[15:29] they're a bunch of prostitutes
[15:32] they can't fulfill that God's gonna have
[15:34] a church without spots
[15:36] they'll never be able to do that
[15:39] oh my
[15:41] they can't fulfill Malachi 4 do you send
[15:44] Elijah to the prophet before the great
[15:46] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[15:47] shall turn to Hearts of the father
[15:50] to the children and also our hearts back
[15:53] to the faith of the apostolic fathers
[15:55] they can't fulfill that they don't even
[15:58] believe the message how are they ever
[15:59] gonna be turned back
[16:02] cause I'll tell you right now it is
[16:03] about being ready for the Rapture if
[16:05] you're not going to be you're either
[16:06] ready or you're not ready and that's
[16:08] what we're here for
[16:10] get ready
[16:12] they'll never be ready
[16:15] they turn down the very thing that would
[16:17] have got ready would have got them ready
[16:20] amen
[16:25] praise the Lord
[16:27] oh my but what are they fulfilling there
[16:30] are all kinds of man's creep
[16:32] s and darkness isn't that right
[16:36] there's amen they're just they can make
[16:39] a church out of any kind of an idea they
[16:41] want to
[16:43] not a challenge you're coming out of
[16:45] damage no other day Megan it's not a
[16:47] denomination
[16:49] another somebody's idea
[16:51] one church is getting together a group
[16:53] upon these people they don't have a
[16:54] preacher every every man takes his turn
[16:57] and talking
[16:59] I guess preaching
[17:03] amen that would be different doesn't it
[17:06] all right we're gonna happen to John
[17:07] next Sunday we're gonna have another
[17:08] John next Sunday
[17:10] amen
[17:11] we have everybody up there talking ain't
[17:13] called to be a preacher might be able to
[17:14] talk anybody can talk
[17:18] it's a different thing never fulfill
[17:20] I'll tell you what they're fulfilled
[17:21] like
[17:23] they fulfill the scripture where they
[17:26] had him on Revelations and through
[17:27] chapter 8 but I would stand at the door
[17:29] knocked that's what they're fulfilling
[17:31] no wonder he could say that they don't
[17:34] never be able to make a Rapture they'll
[17:36] never be ever ready for a body change
[17:39] can't never fulfill the promise he can't
[17:42] that the commission for this hour
[17:45] praise the Lord let me know somebody
[17:47] will
[17:50] but he's going to fulfill the commission
[17:52] of this hour
[17:54] and that is to have a pride that's ready
[17:58] a people that's been washed in the blood
[18:01] oh my I like it Mr brother man
[18:04] just got preaching Amen to the Bride of
[18:07] Jesus Christ and even in Shalom uh to
[18:09] the bride I say peace peace and so forth
[18:12] here he's talking about if you're
[18:13] believing every word every God every
[18:15] Tittle you are standing I know you've
[18:17] never done it in the first place
[18:20] you're the Spotless Body of Christ the
[18:23] message shall bring that
[18:27] um
[18:29] sure he will
[18:31] oh my
[18:33] let's slow down and go back a little bit
[18:35] let's pick this up a little bit about
[18:37] growth how many of these were growing
[18:39] up into Christ
[18:43] I want more of Jesus more and more and
[18:45] more
[18:46] amen
[18:49] now notice he says now you don't have to
[18:52] die to get this you have to spiritually
[18:53] die out but you don't have to physically
[18:55] die the inside is where God gets in to
[18:58] control you
[19:00] amen how many at least that's what's
[19:01] going on he presses
[19:06] man
[19:11] again
[19:12] just get all the meanness the
[19:14] Superstition and all the unbelief out of
[19:16] you and every time you move out a little
[19:18] bit of unbelief God steps right up there
[19:21] and he takes over move over move out
[19:24] unbelief like Joshua carry where the
[19:26] souls of your feet said that have I
[19:28] given to you tonight as we enter into
[19:31] the kingdom of God God's kingdom take
[19:33] out all the Philistines unbelievers all
[19:36] the amalekites all of the amorites and
[19:38] whatever
[19:40] throw it all out like that we take
[19:43] possession
[19:44] they say well the days of Miracles has
[19:46] passed you Amorite get out of me
[19:49] amen I put it print there I've took over
[19:52] there's no such a thing as seeing
[19:54] missions get out of there you are
[19:55] Malachi I'm coming over there you are
[19:58] you're pressing out from that little
[20:00] button
[20:02] is taking over the fibers of you
[20:04] spreading out God working through you
[20:07] and in you and around you
[20:11] how many that's what's happening to the
[20:13] people in this generation
[20:16] oh I like that
[20:18] praise the Lord
[20:22] in Ephesians 6 it said it this way
[20:28] hmm
[20:35] but there it is
[20:37] there's one God and Father of all who is
[20:40] above all and through all
[20:44] and in you all
[20:46] praise be to God aren't you glad for
[20:48] that
[20:48] amen so it's God working in his pride
[20:52] how are they ever going to fulfill the
[20:54] part where there's going to be a messiah
[20:57] how many believe that the church of
[20:58] living on this age is a messiah
[21:01] your Miss Jesus Christ
[21:06] amen now notice
[21:09] from a little button taking over next
[21:11] paragraph no wonder Elijah in his body
[21:13] upon that dead baby and it comes alive
[21:15] it was God in the man God had took over
[21:19] he was anointed Jesus said he was every
[21:22] prophet of God in the Old Testament was
[21:24] anointed with the Holy Ghost they were
[21:26] they were the Lesser lights he was the
[21:28] fullness of God being Messiah he says
[21:30] they was Messiah it's then smaller
[21:32] Messiahs and they were Anointed with the
[21:35] same spirit that he was anointed with
[21:37] only he had it in his fullness and every
[21:40] man today that's received a true baptism
[21:44] of the Holy Ghost
[21:46] there's a
[21:48] Anointed with the same spirit that loved
[21:51] to come to church instead of them you
[21:54] know amen and listen to a preacher that
[21:56] anointed by the Holy Ghost and they
[21:58] really just preach the word of God oh we
[22:00] just enjoy it don't we
[22:02] but amen I want you to understand
[22:04] something man I'll tell you what what
[22:06] would happen by the time what would
[22:07] happen amen if anybody got his anointed
[22:09] as the preacher did
[22:14] they would just read that every Son of
[22:16] God everybody that's got the Holy Ghost
[22:18] the man has that same anointing that
[22:19] Jesus had we're all to be anointed once
[22:26] not false anointed at once but real
[22:28] anointed ones
[22:30] we bring the anointing I mean that's
[22:31] when you come to church you bring
[22:33] something with you
[22:35] you bring an attitude with you you bring
[22:37] a spirit you bring an aura about you you
[22:40] need to bring more of that liquor fire
[22:42] or you bring a wet wreck
[22:49] come on people think about it I'm here
[22:52] to tell you whoa
[22:54] oh we could just have an altar call
[22:56] right now how many we need more
[22:58] anointing
[22:59] we just need my idea
[23:02] the preacher sure does are you gonna
[23:04] have a dancer Sherman
[23:10] that's you sure do
[23:15] amen I like that I had to underline that
[23:17] is that okay it's right there

[23:21] that we eat that changes us
[23:26] oh my aren't you glad for that
[23:28] now notice that's right
[23:32] oh
[23:34] now notice he went about doing good and
[23:37] Healing The Sick that makes me feel good
[23:39] to know that he lives today there's
[23:41] something about a man
[23:43] he is a God
[23:45] he was made to be a god his purpose here
[23:48] on Earth was to be a god
[23:51] to have dominion over everything in the
[23:53] Earth
[23:58] folks I'm here today aren't you glad
[23:59] that when you conquer the devil you rule
[24:02] over the Devils you rule over your flesh
[24:04] you rule over a depression you ruled
[24:07] over all kinds of things
[24:09] I said to Adam use yard to have dominion
[24:12] over the fish of the sea over there
[24:16] there's something in us there's
[24:18] something in all of humanity that's
[24:20] groaning and then we realize that we
[24:22] aren't supposed to have to go to work
[24:23] every day we should
[24:28] be able to speak the word regardless
[24:32] there's something groaning in US
[24:34] we build a better house and a better
[24:36] house we want a better disabilities
[24:38] because we want perfection
[24:43] we want to build a big retirement so
[24:45] that we can take it easy and enjoy life
[24:47] a little but guess what you'll never
[24:49] really get to enjoy it to you
[24:52] oh
[24:57] amen
[24:58] made to be a God he says
[25:01] amen I believe it's the seals not the
[25:03] seals but he's true Easter seal have
[25:05] dominion over everything in the earth oh
[25:07] my now don't let that stagger you
[25:11] because
[25:13] I got some scripts like God
[25:18] and Aaron
[25:19] you'll be his prophet
[25:22] that's right the prophets you call them
[25:24] gods
[25:26] so why you stagger so much when I say
[25:29] I'm the son of God
[25:30] amen
[25:32] here the other night I saw a telecast of
[25:34] a man with
[25:36] spiky
[25:37] mental faith
[25:39] it's a wonder sit back and kept
[25:42] concentrating on that glass of water
[25:45] till it bursted to that
[25:48] just by concentration
[25:50] watching that glass of water and the
[25:53] glass of rotted water that glass cracked
[25:55] and the water ran out
[25:56] just pure mental consciousness
[26:00] concentration why that's his fibers
[26:05] that's his makeup
[26:07] I wanted to find it but he says you know
[26:09] man
[26:09] what
[26:11] was made to have
[26:16] he was made to be able to do that
[26:20] now notice if he can do that got the
[26:22] power in him by mental thinking that he
[26:25] can break a glass of water and him being
[26:28] a sinner that shows that there is
[26:30] something made in that man this is where
[26:33] I got myself oh my there's something in
[26:36] US isn't it
[26:37] that calls for being able to speak to
[26:41] the storms speak to things
[26:43] we weren't made to cry
[26:47] made to speak
[26:52] likewise feet can go forward Moses
[27:03] it shows there's something made in him
[27:05] to be like that one he's a fallen
[27:07] perverted condition
[27:09] but if that man can only get back to God
[27:12] and let God get into him with that power
[27:16] turned loose in the kingdom of God
[27:19] amen
[27:21] praise
[27:23] the Lord
[27:25] he didn't have what it was he didn't
[27:27] have no conduct doctor he was like a
[27:31] shotgun he just splattered every way but
[27:33] if that if that Spirit that's in a man
[27:36] could be converted and put Christ in
[27:38] there or he's got a conductor a
[27:40] conductor is a wire that conducts it
[27:42] amen
[27:44] let and let a man with that same Faith
[27:46] do not conduct her in the word of God he
[27:48] can raise the dead cleanse the lepers
[27:50] cast out Devils amen passion like unto
[27:53] God looks like God sure what that's
[27:54] reading God was it was
[27:57] the man because man was gone and that's
[28:00] his offsprings I thought about that you
[28:02] know you talk about a receptacle listen
[28:04] how many knows there's a left are you
[28:06] receptacle like Amen in that receptacle
[28:08] there's a wire that comes to that when
[28:09] you plug it into there guess what you
[28:12] got power you and I are the wire
[28:15] you and I are the conductor we're the
[28:17] liar but it takes thought to power that
[28:20] water
[28:23] when we lay our hands on the set the
[28:25] honor recover we're not just flattering
[28:27] here now that when we lay our hands on
[28:29] you you ought to get the baptism of the
[28:31] Holy Ghost
[28:34] amen not just the glass and just shoot
[28:36] it out there but pinpoint now Devil's
[28:38] all these disease now
[28:42] not you got to go in the name of the
[28:44] Lord
[28:45] that's what God's made his children
[28:49] to be a conductor
[28:52] he's the power
[28:54] I am the vine ye are the branches isn't
[28:56] that right
[28:57] oh man if an unconverted person can do
[29:00] that
[29:01] what should you and I do
[29:03] that are connected to Jesus Christ
[29:06] amen
[29:09] praise be to God
[29:13] Hallelujah
[29:16] Say Amen
[29:18] a conductor
[29:24] now notice when we get born again what
[29:27] happens let's look at this
[29:29] growing let's talk about growing into
[29:31] the resurrection because how many
[29:33] beliefs there's a Time coming where
[29:35] headed Towers fulfilling
[29:37] the one scripture where it says we which
[29:39] are alive and remain shall not prevent
[29:41] them which are asleep
[29:42] come into that place that the Bible
[29:44] talks where God is in control amen
[29:47] not like this now notice
[29:49] it's the earnest
[29:56] amen
[30:03] let me make sure I got them all
[30:06] oh my
[30:08] that's right
[30:13] passed over some of that
[30:16] maybe we'll pick it up notice the
[30:19] earnest or the potential the quickening
[30:21] power of your Resurrection when you
[30:23] receive the Holy Ghost
[30:25] is then dwelling in you the potential of
[30:28] it you are now on your way growing to
[30:32] the full Resurrection
[30:34] how many believe that
[30:36] a tree dust doesn't come up overnight
[30:39] blows into it
[30:41] amen
[30:43] I'll tell you what I've listened to a
[30:45] lot of preachers lately
[30:46] now I'm amazed at the things that people
[30:49] are preaching now compared to 15 years
[30:51] ago even
[30:54] thank you
[30:55] amen
[30:57] you can't go higher than the pastor then
[30:59] the pastor has to go up somehow yeah
[31:02] right you got to go a little higher
[31:04] church is ever going to come higher the
[31:06] five-fold minutes you're going to come
[31:07] higher
[31:08] in the UC I see I I I dig into things
[31:12] like this and I dig things out that I
[31:13] ain't never noticed really before
[31:15] to try to bring it out and feed to the
[31:17] people amen
[31:18] how many believes there's rapturing
[31:20] faith in there there's a body change
[31:22] laying there
[31:24] there's power for you to live above sin
[31:27] day after day after day after day amen
[31:30] praise be to God
[31:32] now notice that's right so he says now
[31:34] he's talking about a Grove he was
[31:36] actually talking about uh Martin Luther
[31:38] how did he grow from Grace if not it was
[31:40] the baptism of the Holy Spirit now as
[31:43] the Pentecostal Church baptized into the
[31:45] Holy Ghost it's been growing limbs that
[31:47] died got pruned off and so filled but
[31:49] the Stills the trees still growing it's
[31:51] going on and you're led by the spirit
[31:53] the Quicken the word to you who believes
[31:55] it the word keeps quickening as you come
[31:58] to the first slip second limb third limb
[32:00] on top
[32:04] it just keeps on quickening
[32:06] now God gave Abraham him a promise
[32:09] Abraham believed God and he was imputed
[32:11] unto them for righteousness and he was
[32:13] sealed notice he was sealed that
[32:15] Covenant by the Seal of circumcision
[32:18] and when God gives you the promise
[32:21] potentially you have received it and
[32:23] you're going to be raised up this body
[32:25] is going to be glorified with him at the
[32:27] end but you see you've got to get a
[32:30] clearance of the deed I didn't really
[32:32] get into some of those things but how
[32:34] many notes whenever you go to buying a
[32:36] piece of property amen they do a title
[32:38] search
[32:39] they do a title search so that when you
[32:41] get the D we get the abstract deed and
[32:43] then it's all cleared
[32:45] so that it's all yours there's no liens
[32:47] against nothing else amen now notice now
[32:52] clearance interact
[32:54] do it you've got to see all this it's
[32:57] yours everything on it belongs to you
[33:00] how many believes everything on that
[33:02] belongs to you when you get the baptism
[33:05] of the Holy Ghost this whole book is
[33:08] yours
[33:09] hahaha
[33:12] God help us to open up
[33:15] that valve a little bit more Lord give
[33:18] me a little more give me a little more
[33:21] Hallelujah I know this he's got a
[33:25] Clinton today the abstract there's your
[33:27] seal it's yours and when we believed on
[33:29] Jesus Christ as our savior and repent
[33:31] and baptized and come up to believe in
[33:32] him God recognizes our repentance and
[33:35] our faith towards him and sends down the
[33:37] abstract the abstract is the Assurance
[33:40] it's the guarantee
[33:43] thing that was ever held against
[33:47] the prop
[33:49] ER property has been fraction
[33:53] hahaha
[33:54] how many times that when you get the
[33:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and you
[33:59] you are quickened it means that God Amen
[34:01] is going to Quicken you one day even to
[34:04] a body change
[34:06] it's your assurance
[34:09] I'm just glad for that
[34:10] and it also means and as we've heard
[34:12] many times that the second that a person
[34:15] genuinely repents of their sins and
[34:18] believes on the Lord Jesus Christ if you
[34:20] genuinely do that God is obligated to
[34:22] give you the baptism
[34:25] right there
[34:27] we've always hollowed so many our times
[34:29] heard the story or the brother ban him
[34:31] he says you know that if you do get the
[34:33] Holy Ghost it shows that God accepted
[34:36] your sacrifice
[34:38] he accepted your sacrifice
[34:42] but this is something a little bit
[34:44] deeper than just accepting your
[34:46] sacrifice or whatever but it's a
[34:48] guarantee he talks about that it's a
[34:49] guarantee the property has been
[34:53] bought
[34:55] Amen Let somebody try to take put you
[34:58] off the land when he says it belongs to
[35:00] you and you got the abstract in your
[35:02] hand let him try to do it there ain't no
[35:04] law in the land that can do it because
[35:06] you hold the abstract amen there's no
[35:09] devil no church no theology that could
[35:12] ever overstep the boundaries of God's
[35:15] proof and the abstract is the baptism of
[35:18] the Holy Ghost has recognized you into
[35:20] Christ Jesus and thus the surest he has
[35:23] raised up because potentially we have
[35:25] already raised with him the whole thing
[35:27] what does it do to our mortal bodies it
[35:30] turns our opinion it changes our Notions
[35:32] and it sets our affections on things
[35:35] which are from above
[35:37] smoking drinking gambling and things
[35:39] that we used to do their dad different
[35:40] nature you've been crooked this quickly
[35:43] power brings your body into a raptured
[35:47] conditional already
[35:50] wow let me tell you whenever that
[35:52] happens and you come over come holiday
[35:54] thing I think let me breaks your body
[35:57] your body has to be in a rapturing
[36:01] condition
[36:02] before it takes the rapture
[36:04] you ain't gonna have all kinds of stuff
[36:06] hanging on you
[36:08] no
[36:09] how many bleeds it brings you into a
[36:12] Rapture condition
[36:13] oh my people say well I just can't quit
[36:16] this I can't quit that how many knows
[36:17] you need to get the canner in there
[36:22] the one that makes these cats all go
[36:24] away
[36:28] how can I open it up more how can I be
[36:30] ready as I said earlier
[36:34] I can have more of God
[36:36] I can open this thing up more so I can
[36:39] get more
[36:41] and I want to take it a little deeper if
[36:42] I can with the help of the Lord
[36:45] we've heard the saying and we know what
[36:46] brother bam said if you want to get
[36:48] closer to God
[36:49] is that right
[36:51] pray more
[36:53] read your Bible more
[36:57] hey man everybody said if you are you
[37:00] ought to be as a Christian you have to
[37:02] ask yourself how much are you praying
[37:08] how many sermons do you listen to in a
[37:10] day
[37:11] write it down get your buck
[37:14] how many sermons did you listen to
[37:16] between Sunday and Wednesday
[37:19] see
[37:20] church that you read
[37:22] [Music]
[37:27] five minutes
[37:29] I believe it's time to go to ten from 10
[37:31] to 15 10 15 to an hour maybe two hours
[37:34] maybe three maybe four maybe five
[37:39] it's always right there
[37:41] because somebody knows when you planted
[37:43] in Christ it all depends
[37:45] I don't care what it is folks
[37:49] well I can't overcome this pay for me
[37:52] brother Byler
[37:55] you got to do more than get prayed for
[38:00] hey man just what do we teach people of
[38:03] how they're going to overcome something
[38:06] in themselves can they can they do it in
[38:10] themselves
[38:11] no
[38:13] what helps them overcome what causes
[38:15] them
[38:16] to overcome
[38:18] the power of the Holy Ghost
[38:23] nobody help me pray for me I don't want
[38:25] to be that way then get more to Holy
[38:27] Ghost this preacher is going to tell you
[38:28] what you need is more Holy Ghost
[38:32] but the Holy Ghost will help you it'll
[38:34] cause you to overcome that
[38:36] I'll pray with you and I believe with
[38:38] you but if you kill God then do the same
[38:40] thing it ain't gonna change a thing
[38:43] the only way that you'll get the thing
[38:45] that you want from God is to get more of
[38:47] the Holy Ghost
[38:49] to have more faith than almighty God
[38:51] because I want you to know God Amen he
[38:53] wants us to have the kind of faith that
[38:54] we can speak to a mountain and be
[38:56] plucked up into the sea and it doesn't
[38:58] whatsoever things you desire when you
[39:00] believe him and ask believe that you'll
[39:02] have
[39:06] I can't do it no I can't
[39:09] you can't do it
[39:12] you've got to come to the junction it's
[39:14] no more I have to still be subject to
[39:16] this and subject to that no no it's time
[39:18] to Veer off and get into the world of
[39:20] possibility
[39:21] all things are possible
[39:26] the reason we don't I'm telling you now
[39:28] the reason we tell
[39:31] we die I guess it's the right word I
[39:33] don't know that we put the things that
[39:35] should be second to us are first to us
[39:38] your job
[39:40] your money
[39:41] your home your welfare often all things
[39:45] are first or tops and then God is second
[39:47] that's why you don't that's why we're
[39:49] not where we're ought to be
[39:51] listen to me here listen to me out there
[39:54] that's your problem
[39:56] you
[39:57] one more God
[40:00] read more
[40:01] but he said pray more
[40:03] you want to get closer to God you want
[40:05] more of his power that's the only thing
[40:06] you do
[40:12] amen
[40:14] set your affections
[40:18] on things above I mean please
[40:21] what are your passionists the problem is
[40:24] with our passion
[40:27] oh yeah our affectionate cowards
[40:32] what we treasure
[40:34] because what you treasure that's where
[40:36] your heart will be
[40:43] Lord thank God
[40:45] part of your soul and part of your
[40:47] strength and part of your mind he says
[40:50] Thou shalt love my Lord God thank God
[40:52] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[40:54] with all thy strength with all thy mind
[41:04] I wanted to close at 15 after but we're
[41:06] already past that
[41:08] turn the song with me if you will that
[41:10] was me Holy Spirit wants to go a little
[41:12] further is that right
[41:14] praise the Lord I mean I was David was
[41:17] quite the guy wasn't he David was quite
[41:19] the man
[41:22] and he said in Psalms he broke this way
[41:24] blessed is the man that woke up not in
[41:25] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[41:27] in the way of the Sinners nor sinners in
[41:29] the seat of the scornful but his Delight
[41:31] is in the law of the Lord and then his
[41:33] law does he meditate once in a while
[41:37] a few minutes in the morning a few
[41:40] minutes in the afternoon no he meditate
[41:43] day and night
[41:56] pattern where is your meditation
[42:00] that's the problem
[42:09] we meditate even talk about the Lord a
[42:11] little more and I'll tell you what he
[42:12] comes around don't he
[42:14] want more of God's anointing how many
[42:16] knows we need more of his anointing
[42:18] it's what you feed on
[42:21] it's what you meditate on
[42:24] he told Joshua the same thing amen
[42:30] he says Thou this book of the law shall
[42:32] not depart out of thy mouth but Thou
[42:34] shalt meditate therein they
[42:38] they who was talking to him I guess God
[42:40] right
[42:41] that's right somebody was telling him
[42:43] that
[42:45] I guess it was probably I don't know who
[42:48] wrote Mo who wrote the Book of Joshua
[42:50] Book of Joshua perhaps I don't even know
[42:53] I guess it would be Joshua that wrote it
[42:55] but anyway we know it had to be God
[42:58] that said that to him so how many know
[43:00] who knows better than God or the angels
[43:02] of the Lord whatever Inspire him to
[43:03] write this
[43:04] amen
[43:07] praise the Lord
[43:10] all right
[43:13] read verse one and we'll have all of
[43:15] these questions that I just put out in
[43:16] front of you answered
[43:18] not after the death
[43:20] the Moses to serve the Lord speak unto
[43:23] jock I swear the son of nuns amen
[43:29] miss the Lord
[43:31] the Lord spoke to him meditate how many

[46:39] it's pretty crazy because we ain't got
[46:41] to go to Johnson City we ain't got to go
[46:42] to Vancouver we ain't got to go to Here
[46:44] There and Everywhere you've got it right
[46:46] here
[46:46] you can listen to it right there
[46:51] you can feed
[46:52] what did I have wrote down here I wasn't
[46:54] even gonna I guess the spirit brought it
[46:56] back to my tooth but uh you know we
[46:59] ought to eat so much Tommy until we are
[47:01] tighter than a tick
[47:06] I have dogs and them dogs love to go out
[47:10] there and get tick bit and them things
[47:11] little things they'll come back and
[47:12] they're just little bitty I look at a
[47:15] day or so later them things are ten
[47:16] times their size their legs are just
[47:19] smoking out of some little blah blah
[47:25] that's the thing tighter than a dick
[47:31] the Bible says let your soul Delight
[47:34] itself
[47:39] we ought to be fatter you'd have thought
[47:42] it
[47:46] why because I'm in a no I'm not
[47:49] talking about naturally we're trying to
[47:51] get rid of that I know that
[47:54] keep trying keep trying keep trying some
[47:56] of us succeed and I like what Brother
[47:58] Brad said I done lost a thousand pounds
[48:01] I caught that because I realized that's
[48:04] not what you know a lot of us do we will
[48:06] find it and then we'll lose it then
[48:07] we'll find it
[48:10] but let's not do that with the word
[48:12] let's find it and keep it shall we God
[48:14] bless you stand musicians if you'll come
[48:24] whether I want to grow into a
[48:25] resurrection
[48:28] I want this word to change me from glory
[48:31] to glory
[48:32] until my body is in the place that it is
[48:34] ready even in some of those quotes Barb
[48:37] talked about how that he's already quick
[48:38] in this
[48:40] this Mortal body has already been
[48:41] quickened into Heavenly places in Christ
[48:43] Jesus all it needs is for that thing to
[48:45] come down and change that body amen
[48:48] amen God bless you tonight amen
[48:51] amen I didn't have no song to sing with
[48:53] that so we'll let brother Joshua lead
[48:56] let's buy our heads
[48:59] how many was a brother Ballard that's
[49:02] really what I need I need to meditate on
[49:04] God more I need to pray I need to read
[49:06] more than what I do I hope those
[49:08] streaming out there to hear this realize
[49:10] that you have to do something different
[49:12] if you expect different results and this
[49:14] is what you got to do you got to take
[49:16] that secular everything that we do
[49:18] naturally and make it third or something
[49:20] it's not supposed to be first it's
[49:22] supposed to be second the third God is
[49:24] first you walk with God is first you'll
[49:27] walk different your affections your your
[49:29] whole makeup your whole personality
[49:31] everything will be different about you
[49:33] when you make sure that it's Christ
[49:35] before anything else and let's not just
[49:37] pray a little bit in the morning think
[49:39] about it everybody think about how much
[49:41] you pray and how much you meditate and
[49:43] see how guilty you are and say God take
[49:46] it away from me help me to meditate more
[49:48] on you Lord
[49:49] and just always have you in my Forefront
[49:53] God even this David said God help us to
[49:55] be that way father if he said that to
[49:57] those people back then I believe it's
[49:58] that way in this hour help us to
[50:00] meditate it on his shelf and he shall be
[50:02] like a tree that's planted by the rivers
[50:05] of water that'll bring forth his fruit
[50:07] in his season God's sure we're going to
[50:10] see the real genuine fruit of the spirit
[50:12] the fruit of God coming forth out of our
[50:14] life when we truly meditate on it
[50:18] day and night and father our hands are
[50:21] all raised
[50:23] say Lord I'm guilty I'm sorry Father
[50:25] where I haven't meditated and Lord after
[50:27] this Wednesday night's service I'm going
[50:29] to go home and say God I come breaks to
[50:31] do what I just said is a consecration
[50:34] Lord and that's what we do tonight
[50:36] reconsecrate ourselves the folk
[50:39] listen to meditating to read and to feed
[50:41] on you Lord on the thing that you have
[50:43] already placed on the inside of us Lord
[50:45] and father we realize the Rapture is
[50:47] already in there lord it's all in there
[50:50] everything we have needed father but we
[50:51] need to feed it more we ask God that
[50:53] you'll help us do that in the name of
[50:56] Jesus Christ
[50:57] amen and amen God bless you we love you
