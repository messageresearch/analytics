[16:54] couple verses here we're going to read
[16:56] all the way through
[16:59] Psalms 115 not unto us O Lord not unto
[17:03] us but unto thy name give glory for thy
[17:06] mercy and for thy truth's sake
[17:14] but our God is in the heavens he had
[17:16] done whatsoever he have cleaned
[17:19] pleased
[17:25] they have mouths but they speak not eyes
[17:27] have they but they see nod
[17:35] they have hands but they handle not feet
[17:38] have they but they walk not neither
[17:40] speak they through their throat
[17:48] oh Israel trust thou in the Lord he is
[17:51] their help and their Shield

[18:22] you're blessed in the Lord which made
[18:24] Heaven and Earth
[18:31] the dead praise not the Lord neither any
[18:34] that go down into silence
[18:36] but we will bless the Lord from this
[18:39] time forth and forevermore praise the
[18:42] Lord amen you may be seated God bless
[18:44] you brother Brian
[18:56] good morning brothers and sisters
[19:00] you know why
[19:03] reading those first six seven verses
[19:05] talking about the Heathen there you know
[19:08] they had actual
[19:10] physical God that they worship in our
[19:12] day and age every everything around you
[19:15] you can make a god
[19:16] um if you return with me to uh
[19:21] to Hebrews the 13th chapter
[19:30] I was listening to a message this
[19:32] morning
[19:34] I was just
[19:37] it was called the countdown and
[19:40] I was saying I'm I'm thinking in the
[19:42] opposite way
[19:44] you know brother by Adam said you know
[19:47] there's Believers and there are each
[19:49] stages of their life some are walking
[19:52] some are riding a horse some are riding
[19:54] a buggy some are driving a car some are
[19:57] flying an airplane but where we're at
[20:00] today as Christians you're all supposed
[20:02] to be a bunch of astronauts and I was
[20:04] just thinking you know
[20:05] once you get on that rocket ship and
[20:08] once you commit there's no going back
[20:10] you're either going into space or you're
[20:13] going in a flame of Glory in a ball of
[20:15] fire there's no stopping it once you
[20:18] commit there's no going back and that's
[20:20] the way it is with a Christian you can't
[20:22] go back in those ages anymore you just
[20:25] got to keep going forward but I was just
[20:27] going to read this 13th chapter here
[20:30] and I was just thinking the age that
[20:33] we're
[20:34] even talking about the things they do
[20:36] out in the world really is this is a
[20:38] place for but you can just know that
[20:40] it's a deprived world the brave world
[20:43] out there and it's not going to get any
[20:45] better and when I was thinking about
[20:46] acceleration
[20:48] is as a Christian in a heart's work
[20:50] accelerating toward a Rapture going into
[20:53] the presence of a living God and the
[20:56] world is acceptable Direction and like
[20:59] brother Bradham said you
[21:01] as we go further and further to that
[21:04] time things just happen quicker and
[21:06] quicker and quicker and quicker and
[21:09] before you know it you'll be on the
[21:11] other side but the world is going the
[21:12] wrong direction it's going in a fast
[21:14] pace too and I I'm not going to mention
[21:17] the things they do but who would ever
[21:19] thought in the year 2023 and then I was
[21:22] thinking
[21:23] sometimes we get so accustomed to the
[21:25] things that are going on around us we
[21:27] don't realize that how depraved it
[21:29] really is I was just thinking if you
[21:32] brought a
[21:34] a preacher from maybe the late 1700s or
[21:37] early 1800s and you brought them into
[21:39] this day and age
[21:40] he would he wouldn't have very nice
[21:43] things to say about the church and the
[21:45] world the state it is because he's not
[21:47] in this environment he's coming out of
[21:50] that environment into this environment
[21:52] so he would see it probably in more
[21:55] clear away than we would see it today
[21:57] and but as a Christian as a believer in
[22:01] the message you have a clearer eye you
[22:03] have the ability you have a clear Focus
[22:05] where you can see through the depravity
[22:07] of the age and you know where we're at
[22:09] so there's no excuses for us as
[22:12] Believers that we're not doing what God
[22:15] wants us to do in the age that we're
[22:16] living in and I'll just read this 13th
[22:20] chapter of Hebrews here
[22:22] foreign
[22:29] and all the depths of the Mysteries that
[22:32] are in brother Brown continually brings
[22:35] you back to the foundation brings you
[22:37] back to simple principles of Faith love
[22:40] in your brothers and sisters loving your
[22:42] God doing what's right whether
[22:46] it hurts you or not just simple things
[22:49] but I'll just read what Paul had to say
[22:51] here
[22:52] let brother we love continue to be be
[22:54] not forgetful to entrain strangers for
[22:57] their body some have an entertain angels
[22:59] unaware
[23:00] remember them that are in bonds and are
[23:02] bound with them and them which suffer
[23:05] adversity and then being yourselves also
[23:08] in the body marriage is an honorable
[23:11] and all in the bed undefiable
[23:13] whoremongers and adulterers God will
[23:15] judge you know you read a scripture like
[23:17] that and you think of the world we're in
[23:18] right now there's no hope outside of the
[23:22] the scriptures
[23:24] and let your conversation be without
[23:27] covetedness and you can take a word like
[23:29] that
[23:30] uh and you can that's the age it's a
[23:32] coveted age everybody wants what
[23:34] everyone else has in the age that we
[23:36] live in right now they're not satisfied
[23:38] with the things that God simply gives
[23:40] them they always want more and but when
[23:43] they want more they don't want more of
[23:45] what they can work hard for and get
[23:47] themselves they want what other people
[23:48] have and uh I lost my place there but
[23:52] covetousness and be content with such
[23:54] things as you have
[23:56] rehab said I will never leave thee nor
[23:59] forsake thee so that we may boldly say
[24:02] the Lord is my helper I will not fear
[24:04] what man shall do unto me and that's the
[24:07] age we're in you know God is our helper
[24:09] you know whether whether you lose your
[24:12] job or not God's going to take care of
[24:14] you you still have to have that correct
[24:16] testimony for what you believe now God
[24:19] doesn't want cowards
[24:22] a lot of times when you're mixing up
[24:24] with people of the world
[24:26] especially in the age that we live and
[24:28] you're so afraid to tell people
[24:29] sometimes what you believe what you know
[24:31] is true what is not true
[24:34] you might think you might lose your job
[24:35] you know then you pretty much know the
[24:38] the age that we live in right now if
[24:40] you're not self-employed if you're
[24:42] working for a big company there are
[24:45] certain things that you would say that
[24:46] might make you lose your job and goes on
[24:49] to save or remember them which have rule
[24:51] over you and have spoken unto you the
[24:53] word of God whose Faith follow
[24:55] considering the end of their
[24:57] conversation
[24:58] and we all know this scripture Jesus
[25:00] Christ is saying yesterday today and
[25:02] forever
[25:03] and this is really important for the age
[25:05] of this ninth verse here
[25:08] be not carried away with diverse strange
[25:11] doctrines first good thing that in the
[25:13] heart be established with Grace not with
[25:15] Meats which have not profited them that
[25:19] have been occupied therein and we have
[25:21] an altar wherefore they have no right to
[25:24] eat which is
[25:27] I'm having a hard time seeing these
[25:30] words here this morning
[25:31] for the body of those beasts which blood
[25:34] is brought into the sanctuary by the
[25:36] high priest for seeing Auburn without
[25:37] the camp
[25:39] wherefore Jesus also that he might
[25:41] sanctify the people with his own blood
[25:43] suffered without the gate let us go
[25:47] therefore unto him without the camp
[25:49] bearing his report
[25:51] for there we have no kitchen for excuse
[25:53] me for here we have no continuing City
[25:55] but we seek one to come you know it's
[25:57] really important I guess
[25:59] as I get older I realize the things that
[26:02] I say this a lot but it's true I realize
[26:04] the things I thought were important when
[26:06] I was 20 or 30 or 40 years old you know
[26:10] in context are they really that
[26:12] important the only important thing
[26:14] really is Jesus Christ in your
[26:17] relationship with them and where you're
[26:19] at day to day and you'll walk with Jesus
[26:22] Christ all the things that you think are
[26:23] important whether you're 20 or you're 90
[26:26] or 100 you know they're really not as
[26:29] important as you think they are and he
[26:31] goes I lost my pleasure again but here
[26:35] we have no containment City but we seek
[26:37] one to come by him therefore let us
[26:39] offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[26:41] continually that is the fruit of our
[26:44] lips given thanks to his name
[26:46] but to do good and to communicate forget
[26:48] not for which such sacrifice God as well
[26:51] please now that's really important you
[26:53] know when you bless people without them
[26:56] knowing you're blessing them you get a
[26:58] blessing from God that you don't realize
[27:00] sometimes you know it's not always doing
[27:02] things for people so they know it but
[27:04] it's doing things for people doing
[27:06] things for others when they don't know
[27:08] that really matters and it goes on obey
[27:11] them that have rule over you submit
[27:13] yourselves for they watch your soul they
[27:16] must give account
[27:17] that they may do it with joy and not
[27:20] with
[27:21] Greek before it is a non-profit for this
[27:24] is unprofitable for you
[27:26] it's kind of speaks to us sheep here
[27:28] where God wants us to be you don't want
[27:30] to make your pastor have to give account
[27:32] for you on that day because you didn't
[27:34] do or he asked you to do it's not him
[27:37] asking you it's the spirit of Christ
[27:38] through your pastor and through your
[27:40] teacher trying to lead you in the way
[27:42] that you should go and he goes on
[27:46] pray for us we trust we have a good
[27:48] conscience in all things willing to live
[27:50] honestly but I beseech you rather do
[27:53] this than I may be restored to you
[27:56] sooner now the God of Peace that brought
[27:58] again from the dead of our Lord Jesus
[28:01] Christ that great Shepherd of the sheep
[28:03] for the blood of the Everlasting
[28:04] Covenant
[28:05] make you perfect in every good work to
[28:08] do his will working in you that which is
[28:10] well pleasing in the side through Jesus
[28:13] Christ for whom be the glory forever
[28:14] amen and he just finishes here and I
[28:18] beseech your brother and suffer
[28:20] self of the words exhortation for I've
[28:23] written a letter onto you with few words
[28:25] now now ye that our brother of I've
[28:29] stopped there he's just talking about
[28:32] salutations to Timothy and the other
[28:34] people in the church he salutes the
[28:36] church in Italy but I was just thinking
[28:38] about that countdown message this
[28:41] morning and I was uh I just wanted to
[28:43] read
[28:46] you know out of Ephesians the first
[28:49] chapter
[28:52] I don't
[28:54] but I'll just read these few verses
[28:58] here and I don't I don't know how to
[29:02] you know when you when you're studying
[29:04] you're sitting there and all and you you
[29:06] know you think you know what you should
[29:07] say and then you come up here sometimes
[29:09] you can get you can become blank and
[29:12] that's when you just gotta let go and
[29:14] let God have his way sometimes
[29:16] but I was just thinking this morning in
[29:18] in that uh
[29:20] I was listening to that countdown
[29:22] message and I was listening to how he
[29:24] was explaining how we're in that last
[29:27] age where we're going to be raptured one
[29:30] day and we have to live the age that
[29:32] we're in this morning
[29:34] where we're not holding to anything of
[29:36] this world where that the only desire
[29:38] that we have is to be totally free in
[29:41] Jesus Christ this morning and I'll just
[29:42] read what Paul said here
[29:44] Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ
[29:47] by the will of God to the Saints which
[29:49] are his Ephesus and Paul is telling us
[29:52] right here that he's not an apostle he's
[29:55] not a prophet of Jesus Christ
[29:57] because of his will when it's God's will
[30:00] that he's in this office and what's your
[30:03] emphasis be faithful in Jesus Christ
[30:06] be to you and peace from God our Father
[30:09] from the Lord Jesus Christ you know
[30:13] I was thinking this morning you know
[30:15] when you all come here even the youngest
[30:17] child here really this morning even the
[30:19] youngest child here this morning has
[30:22] heard more more of the Bible has heard
[30:24] more of the word of God than anyone out
[30:27] there in the world in those denomination
[30:29] they they hear more about the word
[30:32] survive
[30:33] as a child mate can they place it can
[30:36] can they explain it no but there are
[30:38] years here more of the word of God and
[30:40] they'll hear in the Baptist Church down
[30:43] the way
[30:44] they'll hear more of God's word more of
[30:46] what God is doing for us
[30:49] and that's what I'm trying to say we're
[30:51] our blessed people this morning
[30:53] because you can go to churches nowadays
[30:56] that they'll have they'll have their
[30:58] little scripture but they'll spend an
[30:59] hour talking about everything else but
[31:01] the word of God where we're all blessed
[31:04] this morning our whole purpose here this
[31:06] morning is to talk about the word of God
[31:08] not just talk about the word of God but
[31:11] to receive the very blessings that come
[31:13] from believing the word of God in our
[31:16] hearts and lives and I'll just finish
[31:17] this this morning blessed be the God and
[31:20] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[31:22] blessed us with all spiritual blood
[31:25] blessings in Heavenly places
[31:27] according as he had chosen us from
[31:29] before the foundation of the world that
[31:32] we should be holy Without Blame before
[31:34] him in love so that predestinated
[31:37] thought right there that God was
[31:39] thinking about you eons and years ago
[31:42] and that you're an Express attribute of
[31:44] what he was thinking about that should
[31:46] be a comforting thought to each of us
[31:47] this morning that God loved you so much
[31:50] that he placed you in this age knowing
[31:52] that you would be more than able to
[31:55] overcome the age that you live in this
[31:57] morning and he goes I lost my place here
[32:00] I'm sorry if I'm rereading the same
[32:02] thing haven't predestinated us to the
[32:05] adoption of the children by Jesus Christ
[32:07] and the self according to his good
[32:09] pleasure for his will
[32:11] to the Praises of Glory of his grace
[32:13] where in the hath made us acceptable and
[32:16] to beloved and I'm finished with that
[32:19] thing
[32:21] the one thing I'll say as I get older
[32:24] um I still think of myself I y'all
[32:26] probably gonna laugh at this but you
[32:28] know I'm almost 64 years old and I still
[32:30] think I'm 30 or 20 years old I don't I
[32:33] don't know if it's crazy but as a
[32:36] Christian you should your experience
[32:38] should be that young man experience
[32:41] every day of your life where the youth
[32:43] and the desire and everything in you
[32:46] should be just just like it was the day
[32:48] that God saved you your representation I
[32:51] don't care how many years you've been
[32:53] serving the lord it should be like the
[32:55] first day in the day that you're at
[32:58] right now it should be a new experience
[33:00] every day that Joy you had when God
[33:02] first touched your heart whether it was
[33:04] 40 20 30 days ago that experience should
[33:08] be the exam experience we're having our
[33:10] hearts every day and it's that fresh
[33:12] meat that God gives us by praying
[33:15] reading his word Desiring to see him do
[33:17] something for us and for the brothers
[33:19] and sisters that keeps us alive driving
[33:22] in the Asia Brother David
[33:28] amen your little Lord
[33:30] amen
[33:32] amen
[33:34] this old body is getting old
[33:37] but what's living in here I'll never

[1:06:02] amen I can't think of any announcements
[1:06:05] amen so
[1:06:06] amen we uh I felt like I had something
[1:06:09] on my heart that the Lord had kind of
[1:06:11] laid on my heart already uh for today
[1:06:14] and that's why I did spend as much time
[1:06:16] out there yesterday as I did amen and so
[1:06:19] if you will stand with me we'll just get
[1:06:20] into the word of God this morning amen
[1:06:22] and uh feel try to deliver what they'll
[1:06:25] feel the horse lays on the heart to
[1:06:26] speak on its on the same thought again
[1:06:28] on the word of God at the power of the
[1:06:30] word amen and so
[1:06:34] amen this morning
[1:06:35] amen I want to speak on a message I've
[1:06:38] spoke on several different times but I
[1:06:40] want to speak on it again amen and uh
[1:06:44] the thing of it is is where to start but
[1:06:46] I want to title it the infallibility of
[1:06:49] the word of God Amen now Wednesday night
[1:06:51] I believe it was that we spoke on the
[1:06:54] conditional amen how the word of God
[1:06:56] Amen is conditional amen for many people
[1:07:00] there's a part of it there that's
[1:07:02] conditional
[1:07:03] and I I'll just re I look for it and I
[1:07:08] know brother Benham said it and I know
[1:07:09] that y'all will be able to know that
[1:07:12] that he said it but
[1:07:15] and I couldn't find it but he talked
[1:07:17] about how that when he would have a
[1:07:18] prayer line and he'd go through and
[1:07:20] people would get prayed for you're
[1:07:22] healed in the name of Jesus Christ right
[1:07:23] and he prayed for him and and they'd go
[1:07:26] and those people might receive their
[1:07:28] healing they might not we find out we
[1:07:30] know that there's a lot of people went
[1:07:32] through those lines didn't get their
[1:07:33] healing amen amen because it's based on
[1:07:36] their faith so Wednesday night we talked
[1:07:37] about if thou can't believe and and so
[1:07:40] forth many different conditions and so
[1:07:41] forth but if you'll all remember this
[1:07:44] part is the part that I want I hope you
[1:07:46] all remember brother Brahm said he said
[1:07:47] but if the Lord ever says thus saith the
[1:07:50] Lord
[1:07:51] there ain't nothing in the world will
[1:07:53] ever stop it I may know that I mean it's
[1:07:56] going to happen amen when it's thus
[1:07:57] therefore when he speaks like that it's
[1:08:00] done amen there's not enough devils in
[1:08:02] hell ever to stop that amen because
[1:08:06] it's God's directly speaking it's not on
[1:08:09] Condition it's God saying something and
[1:08:11] God can't
[1:08:12] feel and that's what we want to dwell on
[1:08:15] this morning and amen and uh amen and
[1:08:18] and this is touch a message that will
[1:08:22] give us help us to understand
[1:08:25] a little bit why brother Branham said
[1:08:27] that we ought to be the happiest people
[1:08:28] on the face of the Earth
[1:08:30] this is kind of to bring that out to us
[1:08:32] amen and certainly we should be if
[1:08:35] you'll notice uh should but Abram said
[1:08:37] should be I don't know that he ever said
[1:08:40] we are
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:43] but wouldn't it be nice if we could say
[1:08:45] this morning we are
[1:08:48] we are the happiest people on the face
[1:08:50] of the Earth
[1:08:51] amen and if you aren't you still should
[1:08:54] be
[1:08:55] and you can be
[1:08:57] amen if you just take this word and look
[1:09:01] at it that you should look at it look at
[1:09:03] the benefits that we have just like
[1:09:06] living below our god-given privileges
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:09] but if I said we're living the church is
[1:09:10] living way below it's privileges amen
[1:09:13] and in the light of the different things
[1:09:15] everybody probably listening to
[1:09:17] different preachers and the things
[1:09:18] that's being said the promises of God
[1:09:20] that he made and the things that God has
[1:09:22] said when you look at that then you
[1:09:24] realize that we don't shouldn't have to
[1:09:26] say we're living below our privileges we
[1:09:28] should actually be able to say I'm not
[1:09:30] living below my privileges anymore I'm
[1:09:32] taking God in his word I know that he
[1:09:35] has promised it
[1:09:36] this morning focus is not so much on the
[1:09:39] conditional part but we want to focus on
[1:09:41] what God Said and it's going to be
[1:09:46] not only said let me say this because we
[1:09:49] know what brother bam said about God's
[1:09:51] thinking that God's thinking is his
[1:09:53] eternalism Lords are
[1:09:55] isn't that right
[1:09:57] so God taught it we're talking about the
[1:09:59] thoughts of God Amen that they are
[1:10:01] Eternal amen praise the Lord amen and
[1:10:05] then we want to look at how we are a
[1:10:06] part of that word and how that we're as
[1:10:08] Eternal as God as a word is eternal and
[1:10:10] how that we can no more pass away than
[1:10:12] God pass away
[1:10:13] but
[1:10:15] but
[1:10:16] that sounds like a condition to me don't
[1:10:18] it do you there's a condition amen that
[1:10:21] is you have to be in a certain place
[1:10:23] before that before that applies to you
[1:10:26] amen and I'll just go ahead and say it
[1:10:29] before I don't you leave church well I
[1:10:31] wonder what he was ever going to say and
[1:10:33] that is Mr bam says now if you have
[1:10:34] eternal life
[1:10:36] in other words if you're saved if you
[1:10:37] got the Holy Ghost then that means that
[1:10:39] you're a part of that that God is Amen
[1:10:42] in any thinking amen that's how it
[1:10:45] applies but that's where the butt comes
[1:10:46] from but if you are saved amen but if
[1:10:49] you're not saved then you don't know
[1:10:51] that yet amen you only know this because
[1:10:54] of it turn with me to Isaiah the 57th
[1:10:57] chapter review Isaiah 56 amen
[1:11:01] also I feel feel that say that I've been
[1:11:04] enjoying brother Danny's Thursday night
[1:11:05] messages and I know that we've only got
[1:11:08] maybe six seven I don't know four or
[1:11:10] five we ain't got a lot of listeners so
[1:11:12] I mean let's try to tune in on Thursday
[1:11:14] for brother Danny amen let's get him
[1:11:16] about 15 20 on there will we
[1:11:19] amen because I really enjoy his messages
[1:11:20] the Lord's giving laying some good
[1:11:22] messages on his heart and I enjoyed him
[1:11:25] now I'll be the first to confess last
[1:11:27] Thursday I completely forgot
[1:11:30] you know because I get caught up and I'm
[1:11:32] like oh my I was so busy trying to get
[1:11:34] ready for us the first Saturday and so
[1:11:36] and then I went the next morning and I
[1:11:39] listened to it you know and I listened
[1:11:41] to brother Danny and I guess he preached
[1:11:42] for an hour 54 minutes I think he said
[1:11:45] 54 minutes he preached and
[1:11:47] he realized it wasn't on
[1:11:52] it wasn't turned on right
[1:11:54] so anyway that was kind of funny but he
[1:11:57] wouldn't be defeated
[1:11:59] and then and he preached it again it was
[1:12:03] good amen so I certainly enjoyed it
[1:12:06] praise the Lord that's the way to go
[1:12:08] don't don't don't stop just because of
[1:12:10] technical problems and the devil getting
[1:12:12] into things and stopping you amen I may
[1:12:14] believe that
[1:12:16] so praise the Lord all right Isaiah and
[1:12:18] that's I don't think we've prayed yet so
[1:12:21] let's pray before we read
[1:12:22] Lord Jesus we have been taught by a
[1:12:25] prophet that is always good to talk to
[1:12:26] the author in a book before we read the
[1:12:28] book lord so now we're talking to you
[1:12:30] because we know that you have spoken
[1:12:32] this is your word that we're about to
[1:12:35] read father and Lord every time we look
[1:12:37] at this word it just gives us great joy
[1:12:40] to know father that we are looking at
[1:12:43] something that is infallible that is
[1:12:45] that has no blemish in it there's no
[1:12:48] wrong in it there's no mistake in it and
[1:12:50] as your Prophet has said the Bible has
[1:12:53] no contradictions Lord what a wonderful
[1:12:55] thing to be able to say this morning and
[1:12:57] to know that it's absolute truth Lord
[1:12:59] and father what you have spoken will
[1:13:02] come to pass it will happen Lord is
[1:13:04] happening
[1:13:06] presently in our lives Lord we ask God
[1:13:08] that you just bless the reading of the
[1:13:10] word now open the word to us Lord Jesus
[1:13:13] by your spirit anoint us to be able to
[1:13:15] minister it Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[1:13:17] amen and amen amen my wife is feeling
[1:13:21] good but she has called so much because
[1:13:23] of this that she has had I don't know
[1:13:25] what it is but in her left side she is
[1:13:27] really really hurting in a rib cage she
[1:13:30] can't hardly move around very much
[1:13:32] almost because if this decide that it's
[1:13:34] just really hurting she claims and
[1:13:36] believes that it's from coughing so much
[1:13:38] that she stretched something or whatever
[1:13:40] amen so we'll just pray that she is
[1:13:43] healed if not we may have to do an x-ray
[1:13:45] but she don't think she cracked any ribs
[1:13:47] or anything but it meant she certainly
[1:13:49] is hurting this morning so remember her
[1:13:51] in prayer would you amen
[1:13:53] Isaiah the 55th chapter Isaiah 55
[1:14:04] and can we take our time this morning
[1:14:06] amen we all had a whole day of fun
[1:14:09] yesterday let's have a wow this morning
[1:14:11] anyway have good time in the Lord Isaiah
[1:14:14] 55 and verse 8 for my thoughts are not
[1:14:17] your thoughts neither are are your ways
[1:14:19] my ways saith the Lord for as the
[1:14:22] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[1:14:24] my ways higher than your ways and my
[1:14:27] thoughts than your thoughts and for as
[1:14:30] the rain cometh down and the snow from
[1:14:32] the heavens from heaven and returneth
[1:14:35] not feather but watereth the Earth and
[1:14:37] maketh it to bring forth Bud that it may
[1:14:40] give seed to the sower and bread to the
[1:14:43] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[1:14:47] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:14:50] return unto me Boyd but it shall
[1:14:53] accomplish that which I please and that
[1:14:56] it prosper in the thing where to I sent
[1:15:00] it amen praise the Lord Matthew 5 I
[1:15:05] believe it is
[1:15:06] Matthew 5.
[1:15:22] 17 and 18. think not that I am come to
[1:15:26] destroy the law or the prophets I am not
[1:15:29] come to destroy but to fulfill for
[1:15:32] verily I say unto you till Heaven and
[1:15:34] Earth pass one job or one tittle
[1:15:39] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[1:15:42] all be fulfilled amen
[1:15:47] let me see I think there's another one
[1:15:49] that I'll just go ahead and read that I
[1:15:51] really like in Matthew I'm thinking it's
[1:15:54] 24.
[1:15:57] Matthew 24.
[1:16:01] and I want you to remember that in
[1:16:03] Matthew 24 Jesus was talking about uh
[1:16:07] end times amen and uh
[1:16:11] Nation Rising against nation and so
[1:16:14] forth and false prophets Rising doing
[1:16:16] wonders and all these things and uh
[1:16:19] the car whoever the carcass is there the
[1:16:22] Eagles will be gathered together to meet
[1:16:25] the true immediately after the
[1:16:26] tribulation of those days the sun being
[1:16:29] dark and then all these things amen but
[1:16:33] down in verse
[1:16:35] 32 now learn the parable of the Fig Tree
[1:16:39] when his branch is yet tender and puteth
[1:16:42] forth leaves know ye that summer is nigh
[1:16:45] so likewise ye when ye shall see all
[1:16:47] these things
[1:16:48] know that it is near even at the doors
[1:16:52] verily I say unto you this generation
[1:16:54] shall not pass till all the things be
[1:16:58] fulfilled now remember how he is
[1:17:01] finalizing everything that he just said
[1:17:03] by saying heavens and earth will pass
[1:17:07] away but my words shall not pass away in
[1:17:11] that precious words God bless you you
[1:17:13] can be seated
[1:17:14] amen what a wonderful wonderful
[1:17:18] statement for him to say that heavens
[1:17:20] and earth shall pass away but my word
[1:17:23] shall not pass away as we speak about
[1:17:26] the infallibility of the word of God
[1:17:28] sometimes we in me as a as a human being
[1:17:31] perhaps we as a human being
[1:17:34] I would say that it is hard for us to
[1:17:37] even imagine that there is a being that
[1:17:40] could never do anything wrong
[1:17:42] I'll never say anything wrong not even
[1:17:45] think anything wrong
[1:17:47] because we are such fallible people
[1:17:51] we are so full of failure as a matter of
[1:17:54] fact and you know it just seems like you
[1:17:56] know I guess just the other day I'll
[1:17:58] tell you what just sometimes it seems
[1:18:00] like everything you do you try to pick
[1:18:01] something up and you spill this or oh my
[1:18:04] you just try to give you anything done
[1:18:05] it's just all falls apart you know or
[1:18:07] I'll try to pick up a prune I won't cry
[1:18:09] too this will fall down and he'll knock
[1:18:11] something else down and I'm like well
[1:18:12] what else it's gonna fall down you know
[1:18:14] it's just so fallible amen sometimes
[1:18:17] we'll say things that you'll think oh I
[1:18:19] sure wish I wouldn't have said it that
[1:18:21] way to the brother or to the sister
[1:18:22] isn't that right amen so we're so
[1:18:25] fallible but to think that there is a
[1:18:27] God in heaven that is absolutely
[1:18:29] infallible randomly talked about he says
[1:18:32] you know I've made the challenge Amen to
[1:18:34] to the world over he says this Bible
[1:18:36] does not contradict itself
[1:18:38] amen nowhere does it contradict itself
[1:18:41] if God would make his own word
[1:18:43] contradict that be A Fault in it how
[1:18:45] many knows if there would be one fault
[1:18:48] in God
[1:18:49] isn't that right if he did he be
[1:18:51] fallible
[1:18:52] if he would be fallible he wouldn't be
[1:18:55] uh you couldn't have confidence
[1:18:58] amen how many knows that that's why I
[1:19:00] believe the Bible said don't have your
[1:19:02] hope said on a man you know right don't
[1:19:05] set your hope in your complete faith in
[1:19:07] the man because he's fallible he'll make
[1:19:09] mistakes
[1:19:11] amen we'll make mistakes so you have to
[1:19:15] have your faith in the almighty God Amen
[1:19:18] how many believes that we got to have it
[1:19:19] in him I like that
[1:19:22] praise be to God
[1:19:25] amen so we want to just take our time
[1:19:27] this morning with the help of the lord
[1:19:29] we want to start with this brother bam
[1:19:31] says you know he says you know God has
[1:19:33] allotted
[1:19:35] that his scripture from the beginning he
[1:19:37] says before there was any time he was
[1:19:40] eternal and these things that's
[1:19:42] happening now are only the attributes of
[1:19:46] God's thinking
[1:19:48] one thing that I'll just go ahead and
[1:19:50] say I'm just going to speak is it comes
[1:19:52] to mind if that's okay but you know uh
[1:19:55] every age was allotted
[1:19:58] a thought of God God thought of every
[1:20:00] age now just to back this up I mean it
[1:20:03] was just to back this up that God has a
[1:20:05] lot of the scripture for every age if
[1:20:07] you don't think so how about the church
[1:20:09] ages how many knows the first three
[1:20:11] chapters of the Revelation amen God has
[1:20:14] sent to John seven letters isn't that
[1:20:17] right in The Seven Ages but the Brandon
[1:20:19] brought it out by the holy spirit that
[1:20:21] he was actually talking about seven
[1:20:23] different Church ages isn't that right
[1:20:25] and the laodicea age of course we see
[1:20:29] that he was exactly right because this
[1:20:31] is that age of rich and increase with
[1:20:33] goods and have need of nothing
[1:20:36] amen and so now we see the manifestation
[1:20:38] of the word of God and light up for our
[1:20:42] age amen but a lot of time we don't
[1:20:44] realize that even just as each age was a
[1:20:47] lot of a certain word so God has a lot
[1:20:50] of that word to be manifested in flesh
[1:20:54] in people
[1:20:56] isn't that right in every age if you and
[1:20:59] I sitting here sometimes we don't grasp
[1:21:01] amen that great is the mystery of Christ
[1:21:04] that but Paul said which is Christ in
[1:21:07] you the hope of glory the great mystery
[1:21:10] is that God is in you fulfilling his
[1:21:14] word
[1:21:16] Justice Jesus was here to fulfill that
[1:21:19] word Peter and them they were fulfilling
[1:21:21] where he said
[1:21:23] even we are fulfilling the part where he
[1:21:26] says he says the works that I do shall
[1:21:29] you do also and greater than these are
[1:21:31] you because I go to the father
[1:21:34] so we got to realize that we are here
[1:21:36] fulfilling the word of God in our age we
[1:21:41] are the light for our age
[1:21:45] we are the light of this message to our
[1:21:48] community we are God
[1:21:50] manifested to this world
[1:21:55] the devil tries to hide that by your
[1:21:57] faults by your failures by how you think
[1:22:00] well I'm nobody I I am if I was a guy
[1:22:02] but yeah God is using you
[1:22:04] because remember brother bam says the
[1:22:06] devil ain't got nobody to work for
[1:22:07] through unless he has somebody to work
[1:22:09] soon it's the same way with God he's got
[1:22:12] to have somebody to have his hands
[1:22:13] somebody to be his feet somebody believe
[1:22:16] his mouth somebody to work through
[1:22:20] oh my when you think about that you
[1:22:22] realize truly that is a great mystery of
[1:22:24] God
[1:22:25] and to think about is if you're born
[1:22:27] again by the word of God
[1:22:30] now you see folks right there is it it
[1:22:32] is that is quite something that is why
[1:22:34] we ought to be the happiest people if
[1:22:36] you're born again to realize that you
[1:22:37] are
[1:22:39] part
[1:22:40] of God
[1:22:44] and everybody likes to be a part of
[1:22:45] something amen
[1:22:47] praise the Lord
[1:22:50] everybody be likes to get part of
[1:22:52] something and I am so thankful to have
[1:22:54] bi to be identified amen
[1:22:57] foreign
[1:22:59] God's word God's insoluble Unstoppable
[1:23:04] word now I want to talk about that a
[1:23:06] little bit amen
[1:23:09] praise the Lord
[1:23:11] so we find out
[1:23:13] that even the brother Benham said that
[1:23:15] in his discernment when he would go
[1:23:18] forth and he would discern the thoughts
[1:23:20] and peoples of hearts for years and
[1:23:22] years and years
[1:23:23] amen and he's challenged anybody to come
[1:23:27] and ever prove that that was ever wrong
[1:23:31] is that right all right that discernment
[1:23:33] was never was that wrong it was always
[1:23:37] correct
[1:23:39] amen because brother Brandon wasn't
[1:23:41] operating himself
[1:23:44] you know I believe in Monks the
[1:23:47] Pentecostals it can happen amongst
[1:23:48] message people it can happen amongst
[1:23:50] preachers that we get these unctions and
[1:23:52] we get these feelings and we get these
[1:23:54] thoughts and we might say something we
[1:23:56] might do something and we felt like it
[1:23:58] was that and we'll find that it was
[1:24:00] absolutely wrong
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:04] that's right because you can't go by
[1:24:06] feelings and things like that those will
[1:24:08] sometimes Lead You astray sometimes
[1:24:10] they'll be wrong
[1:24:12] amen and even the Pentecostals were
[1:24:14] doing it then he says you know but when
[1:24:16] he would see a vision and when he would
[1:24:17] see that that would be different that's
[1:24:19] not just going by his feeling that was
[1:24:21] God operating amen praise the Lord when
[1:24:24] God said that listen and so
[1:24:26] with God's thoughts and his his word is
[1:24:29] so far above ours because the devil and
[1:24:32] your thoughts it'll try to put fear on
[1:24:34] you then well you won't succeed or or
[1:24:38] you'll never make it this that the other
[1:24:40] those are the thoughts that you might
[1:24:41] have God's thoughts are is that you've
[1:24:44] already made it how many believe that
[1:24:47] you've already made it if you ever made
[1:24:49] it
[1:24:50] praise the Lord
[1:24:52] amen
[1:24:53] so we see that this Bible is
[1:24:57] uh
[1:24:58] in God
[1:25:01] and his
[1:25:03] foreknowledge now thinking on the way
[1:25:05] driving here and I tried to put it in my
[1:25:07] phone right quick because I thought you
[1:25:09] know new things happen to us
[1:25:14] you know whenever something good happens
[1:25:15] somebody offers us a good job or oh a
[1:25:18] young man finds his girlfriend oh my
[1:25:20] they'll just be all happy you know mine
[1:25:22] you know it's just a new thing and top
[1:25:24] of the world or whatever it might be and

[1:26:41] plant it'll have all these different
[1:26:42] things and and and everything will be on
[1:26:45] paper
[1:26:46] amen it'll all be pre-planned how many
[1:26:49] knows where the man probably preach you
[1:26:51] know that it's all this is all been
[1:26:53] pre-planned by God
[1:26:55] God has pre-planned it
[1:26:58] well I'll tell you what we I wouldn't
[1:27:00] last long in the Amish or Mennonite
[1:27:01] church right now because they don't
[1:27:03] believe in that pre-planned stuff
[1:27:06] and the god that hadn't of anyone who
[1:27:07] knew everything and he you know before
[1:27:09] he ever started it was already all done
[1:27:17] now let me get you to concede correctly
[1:27:20] in your mind when I say it was all done
[1:27:23] it was all done in his mind
[1:27:27] isn't that right he already had it all
[1:27:30] when I go to the building something most
[1:27:32] of the times I don't have a plan like
[1:27:34] that little building your side that the
[1:27:35] plan it was a floor was there and I put
[1:27:37] four walls on it and I put a little
[1:27:39] foundation on it didn't take much
[1:27:41] planning but I did have a mental
[1:27:43] conception hey this is what I want
[1:27:45] this is hard not to be
[1:27:47] you know but with God eight minutes
[1:27:50] already all on paper how many believes
[1:27:51] it's all on paper
[1:27:54] whoa
[1:27:56] you know the thing that makes me hooting
[1:27:59] and holler is to find out that you are
[1:28:02] included on the good side of this
[1:28:05] if you can believe that you're on the
[1:28:07] part of the redeemed that you're on the
[1:28:10] part that gets saved you're on the part
[1:28:13] that you're his child you find out that
[1:28:15] you weren't
[1:28:17] that's under the devil
[1:28:20] but you're a Son of God you realize
[1:28:22] that's you
[1:28:23] that gives you great joy
[1:28:26] boy we could shout and scream and run
[1:28:28] the owls on that to know that you're a
[1:28:31] Son of God that's brother Brown says now
[1:28:33] are we sons of God we don't have to go
[1:28:35] to Catholic church and well you'll
[1:28:37] become a saint whenever we uh canonize
[1:28:39] you or whatever to do you know and
[1:28:41] overrun that no you're now I think now
[1:28:43] your sons and daughters of God
[1:28:46] I believe you are now filled with the
[1:28:48] power of God we're now in the place of
[1:28:50] authority
[1:28:52] amen
[1:28:54] praise be to God
[1:28:56] so as I was saying it's like a floor
[1:28:58] plan well
[1:29:01] in Ephesians Paul said it this way now
[1:29:04] therefore ye are no
[1:29:11] no
[1:29:12] of the hosts
[1:29:14] oh God
[1:29:16] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:29:20] Apostles and the prophets amen
[1:29:23] everything has to be built on a
[1:29:25] foundation isn't that right Jesus Christ
[1:29:28] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[1:29:32] praise be the Lord how many believe that
[1:29:35] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:29:39] together growth
[1:29:43] and also are building together for a
[1:29:46] habitation of God through the spirit
[1:29:49] so it's truly God is building his people
[1:29:55] God built Jesus Christ when he spoke to
[1:29:58] Mary amen she received the word and
[1:30:01] Jesus Christ come forth and it was
[1:30:03] absolutely a perfect Son of God he was
[1:30:06] the son of God it was God
[1:30:08] now God is taken from that once material
[1:30:12] from that one in this building of abroad
[1:30:15] a church I don't believe that
[1:30:18] I mean we're all I tell you what all
[1:30:20] fitly framed together I'm a carpenter so
[1:30:24] I know that things have to fit together
[1:30:29] I'll tell you what I hate crooked two by
[1:30:31] fours
[1:30:34] I hate crooked two by fours
[1:30:37] why because if you put a crooked two by
[1:30:39] four that cooking two by four it's
[1:30:42] always going to be cooking I've never
[1:30:43] known them to straighten out
[1:30:45] unless you're putting a door jamb up and
[1:30:48] you have to have a long short and a
[1:30:49] sword stud
[1:30:50] then you can take the bow from one stud
[1:30:54] and then take that shorts done turn it
[1:30:56] to the other way and then as you nail it
[1:30:58] together you pull it together and it
[1:31:00] kind of straightens it all out the only
[1:31:02] way I know to straighten up a quick
[1:31:03] before
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:07] folk how many because we're all crooked
[1:31:08] two by four is it God has the street
[1:31:10] enough
[1:31:11] but I don't like it because you can tell
[1:31:12] you what if you've got two by fours and
[1:31:14] you put that most of the time you say
[1:31:16] put the bow out put the bow out let it
[1:31:17] be the outside but all the bows the same
[1:31:20] direction so they all kind of uniform
[1:31:22] are off
[1:31:31] difference and boy your wall it's going
[1:31:33] to look like that when you look down
[1:31:34] that sheetrock
[1:31:36] amen
[1:31:38] but God isn't a perfecting Sage isn't he
[1:31:41] but anyways all right enough crooked two
[1:31:43] by four top but listen so we got a fit
[1:31:47] Leaf frame together it grows into a holy
[1:31:50] Temple of the Lord in whom
[1:31:53] we are building together for a
[1:31:55] habitation of the Lord
[1:31:57] praise the Lord
[1:32:00] oh my
[1:32:02] now
[1:32:06] it's quite something brother Brian was
[1:32:07] reading out of Ephesians 1 because
[1:32:09] that's the very scriptures that I wanted
[1:32:10] to go through amen and am using I like
[1:32:14] whenever the whenever the spirit just uh
[1:32:17] seems to go in the same direction praise
[1:32:19] the Lord how many beliefs were led by
[1:32:20] the spirit here amen if we're not led by
[1:32:22] the spirit here we need help
[1:32:25] praise the Lord I'm glad that we are
[1:32:27] with the help of the Lord
[1:32:29] now notice
[1:32:31] let's go to Ephesians and look at this
[1:32:34] look at the Ephesians for a minute we're
[1:32:35] looking at predestination and
[1:32:37] foreknowledge a little bit you know and
[1:32:38] how like I said we're looking at what
[1:32:41] God does what God does and his plan now
[1:32:47] um because when God says something when
[1:32:49] it's Eternal in the heavens it's never
[1:32:51] going to change it's going to happen
[1:32:57] and verse three blessed be the
[1:32:59] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:01] who has blessed us with
[1:33:03] small spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:33:06] places in Christ according as he has
[1:33:09] chosen us
[1:33:12] when we got burned again
[1:33:15] when we willed huh
[1:33:18] how many knows every believer Wills
[1:33:20] whosoever will let him come like we said
[1:33:22] Wednesday based on whether people want
[1:33:25] to or not
[1:33:26] amen
[1:33:27] and here we know that here he knows
[1:33:30] already the whole thing is amen that
[1:33:32] before the foundation of the world even
[1:33:34] the prophet said he says he knows who
[1:33:36] would want to and who would not want to
[1:33:38] he knew what was in everybody
[1:33:43] he knew what was in them
[1:33:46] and he could put it on conditions
[1:33:48] whosoever will let him come and that was
[1:33:50] going to call out most of them
[1:33:54] I was going to Cull out most of them
[1:33:55] because people don't want it
[1:33:58] Cain was offered it to him by God
[1:34:00] himself just do what's right and you'll
[1:34:03] be accepted he didn't want none of it
[1:34:05] did he
[1:34:06] Kane's children didn't know what about
[1:34:07] the Pharisees and the scribes and what
[1:34:10] was it Nicodemus came to him at night we
[1:34:12] know that dear Mastery and we know it
[1:34:14] sent from God nobody could do these
[1:34:16] things huh but did they all accept him
[1:34:19] then and Zach Nicodemus wasn't he wasn't
[1:34:22] speaking just for himself or he just
[1:34:25] said now I know but I believe if I'm not
[1:34:27] wrong it was we know
[1:34:29] we know that our heart come from God
[1:34:32] they knew
[1:34:33] but they choose to rather pick uh and be
[1:34:37] proud take the side of Pride like
[1:34:39] brother Brooke then said this morning
[1:34:41] got the revelation of God actually
[1:34:43] blinded them
[1:34:46] I never could figure out why people
[1:34:48] wanted to personally I don't want to
[1:34:50] mean to ignore Rabbit Trail here but
[1:34:52] persecute the Jews you know
[1:34:55] they killed the Lord what a horrible
[1:34:57] thing to do is kill the Lord do you
[1:34:59] realize if they wouldn't have done that
[1:35:00] you and I wouldn't be sitting here
[1:35:01] praise God they did
[1:35:03] praise God that he blinded them so he
[1:35:05] would they would they never done it if
[1:35:07] God wouldn't buy them
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:12] then brings to thought well why did God
[1:35:15] blind him then it's his fault then let
[1:35:17] me tell you something
[1:35:18] the Reason God had a right to Blind him
[1:35:21] because he knew who they were in the
[1:35:22] first place
[1:35:23] we think well that's on justice of God
[1:35:25] that's not Justice by God don't you
[1:35:27] start even thinking those unjust
[1:35:29] thoughts of God God is there is not a
[1:35:31] fault in him he's perfect in his
[1:35:33] judgment
[1:35:35] he knew that in those Pharisees that he
[1:35:37] did blind that they were devils they
[1:35:39] were all their father the devil he said
[1:35:42] they'd have never wanted him in the
[1:35:43] first place anyway amen
[1:35:46] so he blinded them amen so he's he know
[1:35:48] God how many can say with me God knows
[1:35:50] what he's doing
[1:35:52] God perfectly knows what he's doing
[1:35:55] and I'll just say what comes to my don't
[1:35:57] ever question him
[1:35:59] we do sometimes it's easy to try it's
[1:36:02] easy easy to do but you aren't supposed
[1:36:04] to don't question God job wasn't
[1:36:06] questioning God by the random he didn't
[1:36:08] want to question you don't quit
[1:36:10] question
[1:36:11] God Amen
[1:36:14] even Brother Band thought that God owed
[1:36:15] him an answer for a certain thing you
[1:36:17] know for this that or the other
[1:36:19] he says he don't okay
[1:36:21] let's go on here according
[1:36:23] yes he's chosen Us in him before the
[1:36:25] foundation of the world that we should
[1:36:27] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:36:31] love having predestinated us into the
[1:36:33] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:36:36] to himself according to the good
[1:36:38] pleasure of his will
[1:36:42] praise the Lord I mean
[1:36:44] his will is his plan
[1:36:47] that house plan that we laid talk he's
[1:36:49] already got the beginning started I am
[1:36:51] the beginning I'm the middle I'm the end
[1:36:52] I'm the
[1:36:54] I'm after the end I mean he's after then
[1:36:58] the end of the world over in the
[1:36:59] Millennium after the Millennium the new
[1:37:02] heavens and the Earth that comes down
[1:37:04] that City that comes down after the
[1:37:06] millennium
[1:37:07] and that's something how he's already
[1:37:09] wrote it all out
[1:37:12] why do you think we rejoice and run the
[1:37:13] Isles sometimes when we say well you
[1:37:15] know oh we already know the outcome
[1:37:18] you already know the outcome
[1:37:22] and not just of the world but of
[1:37:23] yourself if you're in Christ
[1:37:27] praise the Lord
[1:37:29] what does this do I'm I'm gonna
[1:37:32] I'm gonna finish this scripture yet
[1:37:34] before I go over here
[1:37:37] having made known this is down in uh
[1:37:41] verse 9 having made known unto us the
[1:37:44] mystery of his will according to the
[1:37:47] good pleasure of which he purposed
[1:37:49] in himself in other words he come up and
[1:37:52] he purposed this in himself this was
[1:37:54] just even another place over in Old
[1:37:57] Testament who has who has been his
[1:37:59] counselor who has taught God who has
[1:38:02] taught taught him how to hang the Earth
[1:38:04] and and so forth everything he said to
[1:38:06] Job
[1:38:07] you know how to balance it
[1:38:10] amen nobody he purposed
[1:38:13] names
[1:38:15] and stuff that is a dispensation of the
[1:38:17] fullness of times he might gather
[1:38:19] together in one all things in Christ
[1:38:21] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:38:23] in Earth even in him in whom also we
[1:38:27] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:38:30] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:38:31] of him
[1:38:33] who will Who worketh all things
[1:38:38] according after the Council of his own
[1:38:42] will
[1:38:43] that we should be the praise of his
[1:38:45] glory amen
[1:38:46] who trusted first first trusted in
[1:38:50] Christ
[1:38:51] amen
[1:38:54] praise the Lord
[1:38:57] Hallelujah
[1:38:59] you know when we see
[1:39:02] the infallibility of God's word
[1:39:05] it gives us an anchor how many believe
[1:39:09] that and I want to talk to you about
[1:39:11] that for just a minute
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:20] but first
[1:39:23] we as Christians sometimes
[1:39:26] you know we act funny we're different
[1:39:28] from the world
[1:39:30] we're not like the world be called out
[1:39:32] of the world God's children brother bam
[1:39:35] says one time and you've heard this
[1:39:37] story before
[1:39:39] he says a little Norwegian not long ago
[1:39:42] come in and got saved in a meeting and
[1:39:44] he went back to his boss and he says oh
[1:39:47] now listen to this
[1:39:49] d-o-r-y to God d-o-r-y to DOD
[1:39:57] oh

[1:40:02] that's what he said praise the Lord I
[1:40:06] done dot the Holy Ghost
[1:40:08] dot dot the Holy Ghost the boss said
[1:40:10] what are you talking about what you

[1:40:14] church said God give me the Holy Ghost

[1:40:36] praise God for the nuts he said you know
[1:40:39] what you taking all the bill and if it
[1:40:41] didn't have any of the nuts in it it'd
[1:40:43] be a big bunch of young
[1:40:47] amen how many blades it's the nuts that
[1:40:50] are holding this thing together
[1:40:53] because this thing is certainly falling
[1:40:56] apart
[1:40:57] I may believe it the whole world is
[1:41:01] falling apart
[1:41:02] people are falling apart
[1:41:06] the world is falling apart but you and I
[1:41:09] are not falling apart because we've got
[1:41:12] the only thing that keeps things
[1:41:14] together
[1:41:16] this is the only thing that keeps things
[1:41:19] tied together
[1:41:20] [Music]
[1:41:24] oh my your mind will go crazy if you
[1:41:28] don't believe in this
[1:41:30] you'll get nervous
[1:41:32] nervous and you even to have your mind I
[1:41:34] have to deal with that
[1:41:36] why do you think people put
[1:41:39] their
[1:41:41] guns to their brains because their mind
[1:41:43] is tormenting them they can't handle it
[1:41:45] anymore can't think anymore
[1:41:47] how many Blues it's time to think God's
[1:41:49] thoughts
[1:41:51] I'm so glad that we have God's thoughts
[1:41:54] to think
[1:41:55] amen praise the Lord he gives us a
[1:41:58] stability
[1:42:00] it gives us an anchor
[1:42:02] a rock to cling to
[1:42:05] something that causes you not to move
[1:42:09] oh that's what God's word is
[1:42:12] it's an anchor for us
[1:42:14] amen
[1:42:15] let's read about that in our lives
[1:42:18] God's word is our anchor
[1:42:21] amen
[1:42:23] in Hebrews 6 he says for when God let me
[1:42:27] just before I say that how many ever
[1:42:28] remembers that whenever you go to a
[1:42:30] court if you're convicted of something
[1:42:32] and uh
[1:42:34] you know or if you go to testify or
[1:42:37] something whatever it might be you get
[1:42:39] in front of Judge and what do they do
[1:42:40] they'll take and they'll make you go up
[1:42:42] there and they'll put the Bible down and
[1:42:45] lay your hand on the Bible is that right
[1:42:47] and then they said do you swear to tell
[1:42:50] the truth nothing but the truth but the
[1:42:51] whole truth
[1:42:52] why because you're gonna swear by
[1:42:54] something greater than yourself
[1:43:00] I like the devil don't he
[1:43:03] just because
[1:43:04] people put their hand on the book ain't
[1:43:06] gonna make them tell the truth
[1:43:09] they ain't got that much
[1:43:11] respect
[1:43:15] I don't want to say they might as well
[1:43:16] not do it anymore
[1:43:17] all you got is a man's word you have to
[1:43:20] choose whether you're going to believe
[1:43:21] him or not
[1:43:23] my my because that's what the world's
[1:43:25] got to amen and this is just talking
[1:43:28] about the word of God this is talking
[1:43:30] about God speaking amen when God speaks
[1:43:34] he don't have to put uh he don't do you
[1:43:38] know what God has to swear by
[1:43:41] what does God have to swear by
[1:43:44] himself
[1:43:46] y'all are smart that's right God swears
[1:43:49] by the greatest that there is
[1:43:54] himself
[1:43:55] all right let's read now and when God
[1:43:57] made Abraham well I could stop there how
[1:44:00] many knows every word that he says if
[1:44:03] it's infallible don't come back boy then
[1:44:05] every word is a promise
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:09] because he could Square
[1:44:11] no greater
[1:44:13] amen when God made promise to Abraham
[1:44:15] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:44:17] swear by himself
[1:44:20] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:44:23] in multiplying I will multiply thee and
[1:44:26] so after that he had patiently endured
[1:44:28] he obtained the promise
[1:44:32] oh we could
[1:44:34] stop
[1:44:35] there for half
[1:44:36] day oh yeah God makes the promise only
[1:44:39] how many knows God made the promise of
[1:44:41] Abraham unconditionally you're going to
[1:44:43] have children like the stars of heaven
[1:44:45] and then there's a sand that is not
[1:44:46] there and sacrifice
[1:44:48] seeing his son as the prophet of God put
[1:44:50] it he says he knew he was
[1:44:53] One race from the dead already if I kill
[1:44:56] him God can raise him back up he already
[1:44:58] come from the dead so to speak
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:02] and so God Abraham knew that it happened
[1:45:05] but he had to wait 25 years for it to
[1:45:08] happen
[1:45:14] 25 years it was a long time a lot of
[1:45:17] water went under the bridge a lot of
[1:45:19] doubt
[1:45:21] looked like it didn't it
[1:45:24] but in the New Testament and never spoke
[1:45:26] of all that right
[1:45:28] amen aren't you glad that with us it's
[1:45:30] the same way yeah yeah we cleaned this
[1:45:32] out of the other and it looks like a
[1:45:34] whole lot of Doubt but in the end it's
[1:45:36] all gonna be all right
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:40] so I you know there's a lot of thought
[1:45:44] let's come in here and just kind of
[1:45:46] going up
[1:45:47] but what this is
[1:45:50] you've got of the past god of the now
[1:45:53] God of the future
[1:45:55] I am he which was which is and which is
[1:45:59] to come
[1:46:01] I may believe that
[1:46:02] now let's just look at it this here is
[1:46:05] what also what is to come how many knows
[1:46:07] that in about uh well let's just say 24
[1:46:11] hours this is around
[1:46:13] or two is it one at 12 o'clock one

[1:46:32] won't be here doing this you're going to
[1:46:33] be doing that it's going to happen
[1:46:35] that's the way this is
[1:46:37] huh that's the way this is that's why we
[1:46:40] got to be ready and we got to be looking
[1:46:43] for it to come looking forward to
[1:46:45] Hasting and coming of the Lord because
[1:46:46] time is just gonna just a little bit of
[1:46:48] a matter of time that's what Abraham do
[1:46:50] be a little patient just be patient God
[1:46:52] said it it's gonna happen
[1:46:55] I believe it was brother Brandon that
[1:46:56] said you know faith is a long-range
[1:46:59] vision isn't it
[1:47:00] you look ahead you want to be ahead and
[1:47:02] and so many people look at everything
[1:47:04] that's happening right here and and this
[1:47:06] out of the other and when you look at
[1:47:07] this
[1:47:08] everything is going on around dude
[1:47:10] you're gonna assemble and fall and wreck
[1:47:12] your bike over into the dead you got to
[1:47:14] look out at the end you know I ain't
[1:47:16] worried about all of this I'm I'm
[1:47:17] looking at the promise over there
[1:47:19] God said that there's going to come a
[1:47:22] resurrection we which are alive and
[1:47:23] remains how many believe that that's a
[1:47:25] promise of God and that's what we look
[1:47:27] at that's what we aim at
[1:47:30] you know all these little things don't
[1:47:32] worry about these little things
[1:47:35] they're totally insignificant
[1:47:38] amen
[1:47:40] all right let's read on
[1:47:42] for men verily Square by greater that's
[1:47:45] right that's why I said the story of
[1:47:47] going into a courtroom by a greater and
[1:47:51] an oath of confirmation is to them the
[1:47:54] end of all Strife they think well that
[1:47:56] that'll they'll really tell the truth
[1:47:58] now
[1:47:59] where is God willing more abundantly to
[1:48:02] show unto The Heirs of Promise the
[1:48:04] immutable ability the immutability of
[1:48:07] his counsel
[1:48:09] amen the unstoppableness of his word
[1:48:12] isn't that right
[1:48:14] my
[1:48:16] confirmed it by though
[1:48:22] can you imagine
[1:48:24] praise the Lords y'all hear that told
[1:48:27] you it's gonna rain

[1:48:36] look so he says immutable
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:39] ways
[1:48:41] of his consoles confirmed it by Luke now
[1:48:44] the Bible said can you imagine God
[1:48:46] telling Abraham Abraham you're going to
[1:48:48] have a child you know and I've chosen
[1:48:52] how many first he had the twos go
[1:48:54] Abraham he had to call Abraham out
[1:48:57] amen and then he gave him the promise
[1:48:59] just like Romans 8.
[1:49:01] whom he has called then he also
[1:49:05] predestinated whom he predestinating
[1:49:08] he called Justified and also glorified
[1:49:11] amen you promised the Jews but he said
[1:49:14] that and then says Abram
