[1:30] his judgments are in all the Earth
[1:40] which Covenant he made with Abraham and
[1:43] his oath unto Isaac
[1:51] um
[1:53] saying under thee will I give give the
[1:56] land of Canaan the light of your
[1:58] inheritance
[2:07] when they went from one nation to
[2:09] another from one Kingdom to another
[2:11] people
[2:19] saying touch not my anointed and do my
[2:22] prophets no harm
[2:30] okay
[2:35] you can be seated
[2:45] morning brothers and sisters
[2:48] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[2:50] this morning
[2:52] it's good to have a wonderful
[2:55] uh Mother's Day today
[2:58] and I had got that
[3:01] just a couple well one scripture here
[3:03] reminded me a lot of Mother's Day
[3:06] it's in Luke 13.
[3:09] see
[3:14] about where Jesus
[3:17] let me find it here and read it
[3:22] Luke 13 34.
[3:25] is talking about when Jesus was talking
[3:27] about Jerusalem oh Jerusalem Jerusalem
[3:30] which killeth the prophets and stoned
[3:32] them that are sent unto thee how often
[3:35] would I have gathered thy children
[3:36] together as a hen doeth her gather her
[3:39] brood under her wings but you would not
[3:42] he was talking about Jerusalem there
[3:44] and uh I got a couple quotes here
[3:47] brother Brandon was talking about
[3:48] Mother's Day
[3:50] see if I don't get it mixed up here
[3:58] and this is from
[4:00] it shall be even as it was told me and
[4:03] then there's another and the other one
[4:05] was Mother's Day and it's kind of a
[4:06] compilation of them
[4:08] he said well everyone uh
[4:11] things about their mother you know I
[4:13] think mother the good true mother is the
[4:14] Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John
[4:17] mother mother gets them first he said
[4:20] that's the one who brings them up first
[4:22] is Mother
[4:24] and he said and I think the thoughts of
[4:27] mother and I have one this morning by
[4:28] the grace of God still here on Earth
[4:30] with us and I'm grateful for mother
[4:34] mother is so great you know
[4:37] first one that receives you in this life
[4:40] is your mother no one can touch you
[4:42] because you're conceived and she Bears
[4:44] you under her heart and she is the first
[4:46] to know you and the first two in this
[4:48] life to hold you then when you're born
[4:50] she has one of the first hands that
[4:52] touch you and wipe wipes the back the
[4:54] tears out of your eyes she is the first
[4:57] one to pay you and to love you into coup
[5:00] over you in this life is your mother
[5:03] now I think that there is nothing
[5:05] enough honor that we could give a mother
[5:08] mother is first with the child she and
[5:11] she is a great responsibility of what
[5:13] that child will be
[5:15] will be based upon the way that mother
[5:17] starts that child on the path and that
[5:19] it must travel
[5:20] mother has a responsibility from God to
[5:23] place that child on the right Road and I
[5:25] think that's
[5:26] that's why my mother's has a special
[5:28] little touch
[5:30] and that was from mother's brother
[5:31] Brandon's Mother's Day sermon
[5:34] in 59 and how true is that and you see
[5:38] and brothers said it before it was
[5:40] parent delinquency you see the the
[5:42] absence of fathers and mothers
[5:45] in the children in the generation today
[5:47] and it's a it's a sad thing but we are
[5:50] very thankful for good mothers
[5:52] and we want to tell everybody Happy
[5:54] Mother's Day
[5:56] I was a had a little
[5:59] thought here
[6:01] and let's see I kind of get it mixed up
[6:05] here sometimes because I get a little
[6:07] nervous but let's go to Luke
[6:12] seven
[6:14] Luke seven here
[6:19] starting in uh
[6:22] Luke 7 starting in verse 19. and uh
[6:26] the thought came from just all the
[6:28] different pressures we live in a world
[6:29] that's full of pressure pressure
[6:30] pressure always pressure it seems like
[6:34] everybody's under pressure
[6:37] and uh
[6:38] with work with all different kinds of
[6:41] pressures
[6:42] but uh
[6:43] this is uh starting in Luke uh
[6:47] 7 verse 19 and John calling unto him two
[6:49] of his disciples sent them to Jesus
[6:51] saying art he that should come our way
[6:54] for another
[6:55] when the men were coming to him they
[6:56] said John Baptist has sent us unto thee
[6:58] saying art thou he that should come or
[7:00] look away for another and in that same
[7:02] hour he cured many of their infirmities
[7:04] and plagues and of evil spirits and unto
[7:07] many that were blind he gave sight
[7:10] then Jesus answering said unto them go
[7:13] your way and tell John what things you
[7:15] have seen and heard how that the blind
[7:17] see the lame walk the lepers are
[7:19] cleansed the death here and the dead are
[7:21] raised to the poor the gospel is
[7:23] preached
[7:24] and blessed is he whomsoever shall not
[7:26] be offended in me
[7:28] when the messenger John were departed he
[7:30] began to speak unto the people
[7:31] concerning John but went out to see the
[7:33] in Into the Wilderness
[7:38] for to see a reed shaken with the wind
[7:41] but what when she had for to see a man
[7:44] clothed in Saw frame it behold they are
[7:46] gorgeously apparel and lived delicately
[7:49] earned the king's courts
[7:51] but what went ye outfit yay say unto you
[7:54] and much more than a Prophet this is he
[7:56] of whom it is was written behold I send
[7:58] my messenger before thy face which shall
[8:01] prepare thy way before thee for I say
[8:04] unto thee among those that are born of a
[8:06] woman
[8:07] there is not a greater profit than John
[8:10] the Baptist but he that is the least in
[8:12] the kingdom of God is greater than he
[8:14] and uh
[8:16] uh brother Brown said in here
[8:29] and this is a modern events made clear
[8:31] about prophecy he said God sent his
[8:33] Prophet as you as the word
[8:35] had promised in Malachi 3 or messenger
[8:38] I'll send before my face to forerun is
[8:40] coming now if you want to vindicate that
[8:42] to prove it Matthew 11 chapter of
[8:44] indicate the same when the Disciples of
[8:45] John came over to see uh they seen Jesus
[8:48] and they said John is in prison said
[8:50] that we've come to ask you whether he
[8:52] gone to Eagle hide I had been filmed
[8:55] over and he was in prison he was fixing
[8:57] to die said go ask him
[8:59] see John said
[9:01] oh his fans in his hand he'll
[9:04] thoroughly had to die and go into the
[9:07] stalk
[9:08] come up again and make the true bride so
[9:10] he said he'll gather his wheat into the
[9:12] Garner and he'll burn the lot burn the
[9:15] fire watch that that Forerunner of
[9:17] Christ in that age what he said would
[9:19] happen the grain and I hope you're not
[9:22] asleep the grain is here
[9:24] here it'll be gathered into the Garner
[9:26] it was that bride that part of it but
[9:28] what did he say will happen to the stalk
[9:30] it'll be burned with unquenchable fire
[9:32] seek salvation now while you can be a
[9:35] grain not a star see go into the life
[9:38] not the old dead form
[9:40] go into the Life of Christ the word made
[9:43] manifest
[9:44] the main manifest and Vindicated so this
[9:47] is this
[9:48] is the Gathering time the combine is
[9:51] coming you better get into the grain
[9:53] because the Shuck's going to be left
[9:55] behind
[9:56] now what we find happened Jesus to
[9:58] finish my Recreation here about Matthew
[9:59] 11 he's uh saying about John he said now
[10:02] wait I'll give John a book on how to con
[10:04] he didn't say I'll give John a book on
[10:06] how to conduct himself a believer in
[10:08] jail no he said stand around and Watch
[10:11] What Happens go back and show John
[10:13] what's happened the lame wall
[10:16] wow lines
[10:18] see the debtor and blessed is you who
[10:21] wasn't offended in me
[10:23] and the disciples crossed started across
[10:25] the hill brother Madam says that John
[10:27] had uh we went out to see what and did
[10:31] you see what the man catering and
[10:33] software and so case just goes back over
[10:36] that
[10:37] but he says how Jesus had gave him
[10:40] uh a compliment by saying that he there
[10:43] was none like under John
[10:47] okay let's see but he said there's one
[10:49] prophecy has been filled right before
[10:51] the face with a foreman to come exactly
[10:52] what Malachi said now the Malachi 3 not
[10:54] Malachi 4 John the Baptist was Malachi
[10:56] 3.
[10:58] he's already come they did what they
[11:00] said but remember Malachi 4 media after
[11:03] immediately after Malachi 4 profit the
[11:06] fourth coming of John the Baptist Elijah
[11:08] the fifth coming will be in Revelations
[11:10] the two witnesses
[11:12] he'll go to the remnant of the Jews but
[11:13] God had used that same Spirit five times
[11:16] Grace g j e s u s it's all been Jesus
[11:20] all the time Faith f-a-i-t-h Grace
[11:23] g-r-a-c-e and so forth you see the
[11:25] number five is a Grace number and used
[11:27] it won't use just three won't use just
[11:30] two three or four it's five times he
[11:32] uses it
[11:35] see here
[11:36] after the prop but in Malachi 4
[11:38] immediately
[11:39] after the prophet prophesies the whole
[11:41] earth is burnt over and the righteous
[11:43] walk out upon the ashes of the wicked
[11:45] exactly see that's the Malachi 4
[11:47] prophecy but just going back to what uh
[11:50] brother Ren said about John's Eagle Eye
[11:52] had gotten filmed over and a lot of
[11:54] times we live in this world of pressure
[11:56] and sometimes
[11:58] to me it feels like sometimes our Eagle
[12:00] Eye might get filmed over but we got to
[12:03] go back to the word reminds me also of
[12:05] uh how David said
[12:07] uh you know as my soul panted for the
[12:10] water broke so does my soul length after
[12:12] thee Lord and brother Ram said you know
[12:15] uh if a deer gets hit by an arrow if he
[12:18] can ever he might though he might be
[12:19] down though he might have lost a lot of
[12:21] blood if you can ever get to the water
[12:22] Brook
[12:23] and then it'll be all right and the
[12:26] world we live in sometimes it feels like
[12:29] we might got hit by one of the enemy's
[12:30] arrows but if we can ever get back to
[12:33] the water Brook which is that ever
[12:35] present water from The Rock
[12:38] Jesus and uh let's see I got one more
[12:42] scripture
[12:46] we live just in a constant World
[12:48] pressure and sometimes we do get hit by
[12:50] enemies you know fire and sometimes we
[12:53] do get down kind of
[12:55] 21.
[13:02] but we're in an age also uh
[13:06] how brother Aaron said it he said every
[13:08] and brother random said too how the ages
[13:11] they always die they died they died they
[13:13] went into the ground but this age can't
[13:15] die this is the last stage
[13:18] and uh Jesus said here so when we feel
[13:21] Under Pressure we should always go back
[13:22] to the word
[13:23] Feast on the word
[13:25] how many says here
[13:28] in Luke 21 and starting in verse 25.
[13:31] this is what we should be looking to
[13:33] there should be signs in the Sun and in
[13:36] the moon and in the stars and upon the
[13:37] Earth distress of nations with
[13:38] perplexity
[13:41] the Sea and the waves roaring men's
[13:43] Hearts failing them for fear and for
[13:45] looking after those things which are
[13:47] coming on the earth for the powers of
[13:48] Heaven shall be shaken
[13:50] and then they shall
[13:53] and then shall they see the son of man
[13:55] coming in the cloud with power and great
[13:57] Glory
[13:59] and he says in verse 28 here and when
[14:02] these things begin to come to pass and
[14:04] look up
[14:05] and lift up your heads for your
[14:07] Redemption draw an eye
[14:09] and that's where we are we better start

[47:57] background we might have been raised in

[48:04] us to you father we're so grateful this
[48:06] morning Lord we can gather with people
[48:08] who can say Amen to that who can testify

[48:30] thoughts and just hear from you Lord
[48:31] we're expecting this Lord let your let
[48:34] your spirit and your word come and bring
[48:36] a comfort and a healing to every
[48:37] situation that's needed we ask this in
[48:40] your name amen
[48:41] if you want to read along I'm going to
[48:43] read from Psalms 31
[48:45] 31 19 and 20.
[48:58] I like what the brother said it's all
[49:00] about Jesus it's all you talk about is
[49:02] Jesus
[49:03] yeah
[49:05] anytime you get off of that you're off
[49:07] the track it's always about Jesus amen
[49:12] Psalm 31 19 oh how great is thy goodness
[49:16] which thou Hast laid up for them that
[49:17] fear thee
[49:19] which thou has wrought for them that
[49:21] trust in thee before the sons of men do
[49:24] you see where he said you trust him
[49:25] before the sons of men you're not afraid
[49:28] to make that
[49:29] confession
[49:31] Thou shalt hide them in the secret of
[49:33] thy presence
[49:35] from the pride of man thou should keep
[49:38] them secretly in a pavilion from The
[49:40] Strife of tongues you can have a seat if
[49:42] you like
[49:43] this morning I want to speak on the
[49:45] thought of The Secret of his presence so
[49:48] let's go back to that verse 20. let's
[49:49] break it down a little bit it says this
[49:51] Thou shalt hide them in the secret of
[49:53] thy presence that word secret needs a
[49:54] covering or a shelter it's a hiding
[49:56] place it's a protection and that word
[49:58] presence means his face and so what
[50:00] you're looking at here brother sister is
[50:02] that that secret that hiding place is
[50:04] when you're face to face with God you're
[50:06] in a secret place and it's just you and
[50:09] God there's nobody else around there's
[50:10] nobody else interfering there's not your
[50:12] church member it's not your family it's
[50:14] not your pastor it's just you and God
[50:16] and that's the secret place where you
[50:18] hide you from what the pride of man that
[50:20] Pride means snares and conspiracy it's
[50:23] when Satan uses people and your own self
[50:25] and whoever it is he come against you
[50:27] and these snarities like and every one
[50:29] of you you know you're going through
[50:30] life and everything's fine all it says
[50:31] Satan has a trap for you fall into it
[50:33] and you're laying there looking around
[50:34] and say what happened to me I thought I
[50:37] was doing great and all of a sudden
[50:38] you're falling on your back and think oh
[50:39] my goodness what's going on around here
[50:41] and what you have to do is recognize
[50:43] that you're still in the secret place
[50:44] because once you get in there you can't
[50:46] get out
[50:49] you're sealed in and everything else is
[50:51] sealed out and no matter what the self
[50:53] flesh does it no matter what you find
[50:55] yourself doing no matter what you're
[50:56] going through once you're in that place
[50:58] and that Veil is hit around you and it's
[51:00] just you and God together there's
[51:02] nothing can ever pull you out of there
[51:05] you can't get out if you try to you
[51:07] won't you can't get anywhere you're
[51:09] stuck
[51:10] she'll recognize friends if you are born
[51:12] again this morning you are going into
[51:14] Rapture whether you want to or not you
[51:16] can't get out it ain't even a choice
[51:17] anymore
[51:20] all right
[51:22] the secret and that secret place of his
[51:24] friends and it's his secret Because
[51:25] unless you're there
[51:27] you don't even know what I'm talking
[51:29] about
[51:31] I remember right for years I was seeking
[51:32] the Holy Ghost seeking the Holy Ghost
[51:33] because I had in my mind what it took to
[51:35] get it I had in my mind or what it was I
[51:37] had my idea what it was and I struggled
[51:39] and struggled and struggled and one time
[51:41] God just said why don't you quit
[51:45] just stop
[51:48] let me give it to you
[51:51] that changed everything
[51:53] changed everything and all of a sudden
[51:54] oh now I understand now I know what he's
[51:58] talking about
[52:00] before that it was just a mental
[52:01] conception in my mind what it must be to
[52:04] be there
[52:05] and when you get there you realize it
[52:07] wasn't what you thought at all
[52:09] it was because Jesus said you can't even
[52:12] understand you can't see the Kingdom of
[52:13] Heaven except you're born again
[52:16] amen
[52:18] it says this Thou shalt keep them
[52:19] secretly in a pavilion from the Strath
[52:23] uh The Strife that means dispute and
[52:24] controversy of tongues and so again that
[52:26] word secretly it's a little different
[52:28] word but it means to hide it's a hidden
[52:30] a hiding place hide from Discovery
[52:32] and I really like that in a pavilion so
[52:34] this secret this place the secret of his
[52:36] presence is in a pavilion you know what
[52:38] that Pavilion it's a it's a booth it's a
[52:40] covert it's a rude temporary shelter
[52:44] yeah
[52:45] like this
[52:47] that sacred place is right there it's in
[52:51] you it's right in here you say well I'm
[52:53] not a root temporary shell to get a
[52:55] little bit older you'll recognize you
[52:56] are living in a rude temporary shelter
[52:58] it breaks down I don't care how you take
[53:00] care of it it breaks down and if you're
[53:02] here long enough you're gonna die that
[53:04] shelter is going to go away but brother
[53:05] and sister that secret place is when he
[53:07] comes and indwells in your heart right
[53:09] in here and nothing can get him out and
[53:11] we are praying you recognize your
[53:12] praying to the very Holy Spirit that's
[53:14] living inside your soul right here and
[53:16] that brother sister is a secret that no
[53:18] one
[53:19] can take from you nobody can take that
[53:22] from you it can't it's right there this
[53:25] is that root temporary shelter because
[53:26] that secret place I just can come in
[53:28] here and that's why no matter what
[53:29] happens all the way around me no matter
[53:31] what happens to this rude temporary
[53:33] shelter you cannot take that life that
[53:35] secret away from me because I am in his
[53:37] presence constantly it's there it's a
[53:40] permanent place it's a permanent deposit
[53:42] and all it was was that part that was
[53:43] part of God before the foundation world
[53:45] it was quickened alive it was always in
[53:49] there brother will it was now as in
[53:51] there no matter how much you you rather
[53:53] through the things of the world no
[53:54] matter what you do that thing was in
[53:56] there and it was pulling and you can try
[53:57] to find some kind of satisfaction you
[53:59] run here and you run there and you do
[54:01] all you want but something inside says
[54:03] yeah but I'm still not satisfied and
[54:05] then all of a sudden that you come to
[54:06] that point and God comes to you and he
[54:08] gets a hold of you and he draws you out
[54:10] and it's not well I saw God I was a
[54:12] seeking God I wasn't found him oh no you
[54:14] did not
[54:15] that that part of God inside you pulled
[54:19] you
[54:22] he saw you
[54:24] he come running after that sheep that
[54:26] was lost to say I got one over here I
[54:28] got one over here I got one over here I
[54:29] got one over here I'm gonna find them
[54:31] because they they get my father gave
[54:33] them to me and then a single one of them
[54:35] can be lost
[54:36] because they're part of me and if
[54:37] they're lost
[54:38] then a part of me will be missing
[54:41] ain't gonna happen if you want to turn
[54:42] to Psalm 27 David's talking about this a
[54:44] little bit more
[54:46] it's very familiar we know this where
[54:48] brother Grant preached the Rapture of
[54:49] Psalm 27 1 it says the Lord is my light
[54:53] and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[54:57] my
[54:59] all the world right now is just living
[55:01] in fear fear is at a high level right
[55:03] now everyone is angry they're defensive
[55:05] they're screaming at each other everyone
[55:07] is so afraid what's going on it's just
[55:09] the whole world is they're
[55:10] hard it's a failing for fear they said
[55:13] who will I be afraid of
[55:16] the Lord is the strength of My Life For
[55:18] Whom Shall I be afraid when the wicked
[55:20] in my enemy my foes come up on onto me
[55:22] upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble
[55:24] and fail though in whole should Camp
[55:25] against me my heart shall not fear
[55:29] we just say something right now he said
[55:30] my heart shall not fear you might
[55:32] experience filming your fear in your in
[55:34] your spirit Realm
[55:36] you might have something nice in your
[55:37] your mind is all terrible about
[55:39] something but your heart is at peace
[55:40] your heart is at rest your heart is not
[55:43] afraid we'll talk more about that as we
[55:45] go though cap against me my heart Shall
[55:48] I Fear the war should rise against me
[55:50] and this will I be confident ever been a
[55:52] war how about every day Satan brings all
[55:55] he can against you to bring home some
[55:57] condemnation to get you a fearful get
[55:59] you worried get you stressed about
[56:00] something that's the word he's talking
[56:01] about he said when that well that rises
[56:03] against me I will be confident because
[56:05] one
[56:06] thing I have desired of the Lord that
[56:09] life seek after that I'm a dwell in the
[56:10] house of the Lord all the days of my
[56:12] life
[56:14] the rest of it don't matter all this
[56:15] stuff going around it's temporary it's
[56:17] periphery but the one thing that my
[56:19] heart desires is that I would dwell in
[56:22] the house of Lord all the days and to
[56:24] inquire in his Temple because this is
[56:26] the house of the Lord
[56:27] this is where he lives this is why he
[56:29] comes this is our confidence because I
[56:32] can look at my soul I can see my desires
[56:34] I can see from the deep and outside no
[56:36] matter what's going on in my head I know
[56:37] for my soul that um something has
[56:39] changed and that's where my desire comes
[56:41] from
[56:43] oh that's the one thing you desired I'm
[56:45] gonna skip down a little bit I'm getting
[56:46] back to 27 but David says this in Psalms
[56:48] 42 he says as a heart pan adapt to the
[56:50] water Brooks so pass my soul after thee
[56:52] oh God
[56:56] thirsteth for God for the Living God
[56:58] once shall I come and appear before God
[57:01] there he is it's that secret of his
[57:02] presence he said what kind of appear
[57:04] before God why not going to be in his
[57:05] presence when is it going to be
[57:06] something that I can find that
[57:08] satisfaction because there's a thirst
[57:09] you cannot give yourself a thirst an
[57:12] actual thirst is born in you it may if
[57:14] you don't satisfy that thirst with water
[57:16] you are gonna die but that spiritual
[57:18] thirst is born within you too if you
[57:20] don't satisfy that spiritual thirst
[57:21] you're gonna die because there's
[57:23] something inside that has to come to
[57:24] life and that's the thing that pulls us
[57:26] it draws us to God and that's what they
[57:28] were saying there's something inside of
[57:29] me that I just can't find satisfaction
[57:32] until I get to that secret place when I
[57:34] can get along just me and God and shut
[57:36] down everything else around me in the
[57:38] midst of all the trial and everything
[57:39] that's going on I find a secret place
[57:41] where I can rest
[57:43] a place of rest Frank listen David
[57:46] didn't even have that option the act the
[57:48] answer to that that you and I have you
[57:50] ever think of that David cannot be born
[57:52] again
[57:54] David could not be born again but he was
[57:56] a seed of God he had a heart a Believer
[57:58] and so he was fighting this little way
[58:00] he could not actually enter in there and
[58:02] live in that place like you can enter
[58:04] and live in that place because this is a
[58:06] permanent deposit David couldn't
[58:08] have
[58:09] all the uh the the access we have the
[58:12] the the privilege we have today the
[58:14] right we have we have a right to have
[58:16] that conference you have a right to
[58:18] enter into that secret place that the
[58:19] New Testament shows prophets and all
[58:21] those sages and all those things
[58:22] remember said they all would have loved
[58:25] to live in this day why because you have
[58:27] access to God that they didn't have on a
[58:29] daily basis
[58:30] [Applause]
[58:31] you don't have to be a prophet you don't
[58:33] have to be a great Minister you don't
[58:35] have to be anything but you can have the
[58:37] access on every morning when you wake up
[58:39] you can know that I am in the presence
[58:40] of God I am in this secret place and
[58:42] David would have killed to get there
[58:46] yeah
[58:48] oh
[58:50] the privilege we have the access the the
[58:53] the the the the
[58:55] how do you explain it that you can have
[58:57] one-on-one fellowship with the very
[58:59] creator
[59:01] God himself he condescends he says I
[59:05] love you I want you I want to
[59:06] refellowship with you I'm in a
[59:07] relationship with you individually
[59:10] why go to church
[59:12] please
[59:15] what does that have to do with it let's
[59:17] see what David says about going to
[59:18] church
[59:20] let's go back to 27 Psalm 27 4. one
[59:24] thing have I desired of the Lord that
[59:25] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[59:26] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[59:28] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[59:30] and to inquire in his Temple he said
[59:32] that's the thing I desired I just want
[59:33] to see God that's my whole life is
[59:35] focused around God
[59:37] to inquire in his Temple
[59:40] for in the time of trouble he didn't say
[59:43] you're not going to have trouble
[59:44] but in the time of trouble he shall hide
[59:46] you in his Pavilion there's that word
[59:48] again right
[59:49] you are in The Secret of his Tabernacle
[59:53] shall he hide me he shall set me up upon
[59:55] a rock so let's look at these two words
[59:57] the first one is Temple he's referring
[59:59] to a building
[1:00:01] Solomon hadn't even built the temple yet
[1:00:03] there wasn't a temple but here David
[1:00:05] speaking by prophecy said I inquire in
[1:00:07] his temple in this building
[1:00:09] he said in the time of trouble he shall
[1:00:10] hide me in his Pavilion that's that same
[1:00:12] rude temporary shelter and the secret
[1:00:15] we'll go to the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:00:17] which is a tent shall he hide me so he
[1:00:20] said I go to church to inquire the Lord
[1:00:23] but his secret is in the Tabernacle the
[1:00:27] secret isn't in this building this is
[1:00:29] where we come to church we need to come
[1:00:30] here because this is where he has set
[1:00:32] things in order this is where he has set
[1:00:34] a Ministry in order he sent a body of
[1:00:36] Christ in order to do what to get you to
[1:00:38] that secret place in the temple it's not
[1:00:40] just to get you to the church you can
[1:00:42] come to church every day your life and
[1:00:43] die and go to hell but if you ever find
[1:00:45] the secret of that Tabernacle in that
[1:00:47] tent that you're living in if that ever
[1:00:49] becomes a reality then you can't go to
[1:00:50] hell
[1:00:52] that's the difference yeah you got to
[1:00:54] come to church you don't come to church
[1:00:55] you don't even believe the word you got
[1:00:57] you know what Satan will do he gets you
[1:00:58] all discouraged well I don't even feel
[1:01:00] like I have the faith to go to church
[1:01:01] anymore I just feel so backslid I people
[1:01:03] don't even want to see me nobody loves
[1:01:05] me anyways I'm just going to stay home
[1:01:07] go ahead listen to that go ahead and
[1:01:09] stay at home if you think you're gonna
[1:01:10] find God there but if you're one of gods
[1:01:12] he's gonna kick your butt and you're
[1:01:14] gonna get back to church and he'll drag
[1:01:16] you through the gravel and what he has
[1:01:18] to do but he's gonna get you back here
[1:01:19] because this is a place that he is
[1:01:21] ordained to help you find that secret
[1:01:24] place he wants you to get to that place
[1:01:26] and he has a Ministry and place to get
[1:01:28] you you know what that Ministry looks
[1:01:29] like this it's the body of Christ he
[1:01:32] uses the body of Christ to get you to
[1:01:34] that secret place cause they know what
[1:01:35] they're talking about
[1:01:37] oh yeah it's more than the preacher it's
[1:01:40] the singers it's the musicians it's the
[1:01:41] deacons and some people running the
[1:01:43] sound system it's that person sitting
[1:01:44] there saying amen it's the entire body
[1:01:46] of Christ and to find the body of Christ
[1:01:48] said there's something wrong for you and
[1:01:50] you sit in that atmosphere that's
[1:01:52] provided that's that's created by the
[1:01:54] body of Christ and you sit in the
[1:01:55] atmosphere and something inside of you
[1:01:57] it's just longing for something and you
[1:01:59] got too much pride to humble yourself
[1:02:01] and take it
[1:02:05] brother Brown said you know what keeps
[1:02:07] you out
[1:02:08] self-will
[1:02:11] you say yeah but I still like the world
[1:02:13] a little bit better
[1:02:15] I've heard all this stuff before brother
[1:02:16] Phil
[1:02:18] I just don't know
[1:02:21] well there's two things about that the
[1:02:23] first one is terrifying
[1:02:25] because if you can sit in here in this
[1:02:26] atmosphere and not feel a thirst for God
[1:02:28] you have a serious spiritual problem
[1:02:33] but maybe it's just covered over by all
[1:02:35] your pride and self-will and sin and
[1:02:37] doubt and religion
[1:02:41] but you keep coming you'll find out
[1:02:43] because if you keep coming there's a
[1:02:45] good chance that he's bringing he said
[1:02:46] no I'm Gonna Get You
[1:02:48] I'm gonna get you you might not like the
[1:02:50] way I bring you but I'm Gonna Get You
[1:02:53] yeah because you're one of my
[1:02:55] yeah you come here you're inquiring to
[1:02:57] tell what's that inquire after God just
[1:02:58] see God let me let me tell you something
[1:03:00] else the gift behind a Pulpit is not for
[1:03:02] the preacher you all know that
[1:03:04] you have a need you come in choir you
[1:03:06] come and you're prayed up and you say
[1:03:07] God speak to me today
[1:03:10] and the preacher is up here preaching
[1:03:11] along and all of a sudden he goes right
[1:03:13] off on Simone that can't Jason he's over
[1:03:15] here thinking what where is this coming
[1:03:17] from I have no idea why I'm preaching
[1:03:18] this this is not in my notes I don't
[1:03:20] even know why I'm saying this I'm
[1:03:21] embarrassing myself up here what am I
[1:03:23] talking about if someone's sitting back
[1:03:24] there thinking
[1:03:26] speaking to me
[1:03:29] that's what the gift is for it's not for
[1:03:32] me it's not for me to get up here and
[1:03:34] shout and stamp around and scream and
[1:03:35] spit and all that that's not what this
[1:03:37] is for this is for the voice of God to
[1:03:39] speak to you and meet you exactly where
[1:03:40] your need is and you can know that God
[1:03:42] spoke to you today because you recognize
[1:03:44] the voice of God
[1:03:46] that's why you're coming to church to
[1:03:48] get that secret down here to get that
[1:03:49] established in here
[1:03:51] this is the Tabernacle that David
[1:03:53] Longford he didn't he didn't long for
[1:03:55] that Temple of Solomon he wanted to he
[1:03:57] said wanted to build he didn't see it he
[1:03:58] never had that but what he was long
[1:04:00] enough for he knew that he could get to
[1:04:01] that Temple then he could get that
[1:04:03] access right down in here this is what
[1:04:05] we're longing for
[1:04:07] you can go to church all day long
[1:04:12] the problem with that attitude is you
[1:04:14] have a denominational attitude
[1:04:18] because that's what they've done well I
[1:04:19] go to brother Thomas Butler's Church
[1:04:21] okay
[1:04:23] that don't put you in a rapture
[1:04:25] well I believe the message of the hour
[1:04:28] okay
[1:04:29] I don't put you in the rapture
[1:04:31] I sing and shout and dance and preach
[1:04:33] and I I had the baptize the Holy Ghost
[1:04:35] I'd ran the aisles and I
[1:04:38] good good things to do
[1:04:40] don't put you in a rapture
[1:04:42] not at all
[1:04:46] Here Comes the Bride
[1:04:50] nearly married couple God bless y'all
[1:04:55] see now I got off my subject what was it
[1:04:57] talking about
[1:05:01] the secret
[1:05:02] you get behind that you're beyond that
[1:05:04] interview into the holy of holies that's
[1:05:06] you and God no one else can come in
[1:05:08] there that's what we're here for you
[1:05:10] have to get in there friends once you
[1:05:11] get in there
[1:05:13] that's the ceiling that's where you're
[1:05:15] at that's what we come for that's why
[1:05:17] you come to church is that right I hope
[1:05:19] so it's a place of rest let's read out
[1:05:21] of Hebrews 4 let's let's switch this one
[1:05:23] but we're going to talk about place of
[1:05:24] rest
[1:05:25] Hebrews 4 1 it says let us therefore
[1:05:28] fear lest a promise being left us of
[1:05:30] entering to his rest any of you should
[1:05:33] seem to come short of it so he says
[1:05:34] there's a rest is God's rest it's a
[1:05:36] place where we need to enter into this
[1:05:38] rest he said For unto us was the Gospel
[1:05:40] preached as well as unto them
[1:05:45] but the word preached did not profit
[1:05:47] them
[1:05:48] not being mixed with faith
[1:05:50] in them that heard it
[1:05:53] so he's saying he's talking about the
[1:05:54] the children of Israel they're supposed
[1:05:56] to go into the promised land they didn't
[1:05:57] go in because they had heard the mo the
[1:05:59] prophet they had the prophet they had
[1:06:00] this message they had seen all the signs
[1:06:01] and wonders but when they came up to
[1:06:03] actually enter into that rest they
[1:06:04] couldn't do it because they didn't
[1:06:05] believe they could take it
[1:06:08] that's what Satan's doing some of you is
[1:06:09] sitting especially some of you younger
[1:06:10] people probably this morning he said
[1:06:12] holy spirit ain't for you you sought it
[1:06:13] you prayed about it it ain't for you
[1:06:16] just quit just forget it
[1:06:19] he's telling you the same thing he told
[1:06:21] those
[1:06:22] children lives or you can't take the
[1:06:24] promised land it's not for you there's
[1:06:25] too many Giants you can't overcome
[1:06:27] yourself you like the things of the
[1:06:28] world too much
[1:06:33] not being mixed with faith and then that
[1:06:35] hurt it
[1:06:37] and then what he also does
[1:06:41] brother bran says he he can't keep you
[1:06:43] out of church keep you from being a
[1:06:45] Christian and he'll take you and push
[1:06:46] you past it you just become religious
[1:06:49] and all of a sudden you're the best
[1:06:50] worshiper you're the best preacher
[1:06:51] you're the best whatever and you have
[1:06:53] the best Doctrine you know all the
[1:06:54] Mysteries and all that and he showed and
[1:06:56] Satan is actually encouraging you to
[1:06:57] believe that you're born again
[1:06:59] because that religion Makes You Think
[1:07:01] You Are
[1:07:03] good you mix the truth with your own
[1:07:06] ideas
[1:07:07] your own thoughts your own religion I
[1:07:10] was talking to a friend recently I said
[1:07:12] there's so many people I've seen to have
[1:07:13] a favorite Doctrine and they just won't
[1:07:16] let go of it
[1:07:17] they have a favorite doctor and it just
[1:07:19] makes them feel and makes them feel like
[1:07:20] Eve felt oh I have a little bit more
[1:07:22] truth than Adam I have a little bit more
[1:07:23] reality I see more than Adam does she
[1:07:26] Brother Brad says she could see more
[1:07:27] than her pastor did and that's why Satan
[1:07:29] appeals to our sense of of Pride and our
[1:07:31] lust for knowledge well I see a little
[1:07:33] bit more and it's so easy when we see
[1:07:34] someone who doesn't maybe see the things
[1:07:36] we are well they're wrong and I'm right
[1:07:38] and I'll puff myself up by pushing them
[1:07:40] down
[1:07:45] thinking they're in the promised land
[1:07:47] thinking they have that place because
[1:07:48] they know a little something more
[1:07:52] verse three for we which I believe do
[1:07:54] enter into rest as he said as I'm sworn
[1:07:56] in my wrath if they shall enter in my
[1:07:57] rest although the works were finished
[1:07:58] from the foundation of Lord The Works
[1:08:00] were finished the rest was there he said
[1:08:02] we wish to believe enter the rest so
[1:08:04] that's how you get in you don't work
[1:08:05] yourself in you don't try hard enough
[1:08:07] you don't live holy enough you don't
[1:08:08] pray enough you don't go to church
[1:08:09] enough you believe it's for you because
[1:08:11] something inside is telling you they're
[1:08:13] The Thirst for that and you
[1:08:16] and I
[1:08:17] have a thirst you cannot have a thirst
[1:08:20] if it's satisfy it you cannot thirst for
[1:08:23] more God if there's not more God for you
[1:08:25] to be
[1:08:26] satisfied with and so if you would just
[1:08:28] look past all Satan's life and all his
[1:08:30] facade and all the unbelief and you say
[1:08:32] well I'm saying if it's not for me then
[1:08:34] why do I still want it so bad why am I
[1:08:37] still here why am I still praying why am
[1:08:39] I still so miserable if I haven't if I'm
[1:08:41] not if it's not for me why don't I get
[1:08:43] satisfied just sitting on the Pew like a
[1:08:45] lot of other people because if you can
[1:08:47] just be satisfied sitting on the Pew and
[1:08:49] you
[1:08:50] you don't have in there that is probably
[1:08:52] a good idea it's a good thought or an
[1:08:54] indication that that thirst is not in
[1:08:56] there but if you're sitting there and
[1:08:57] you know there's more for you because
[1:08:58] look even after you're in there all you
[1:09:01] do is thirst for more
[1:09:03] you do not get satisfied and say well I
[1:09:06] got all of God I want I don't need it
[1:09:08] anymore God I'm just going to sit back
[1:09:09] when we get to this a little bit later
[1:09:11] but brother and sister if there's a
[1:09:13] thirst in there if it's been satisfied
[1:09:14] let me ask you this did you ever do a
[1:09:16] drink of water
[1:09:18] does that mean you're not thirsty
[1:09:19] anymore
[1:09:20] how many times do you need a drink
[1:09:23] every day
[1:09:25] every day and if that thirst is that
[1:09:27] thing is in there all you want is more
[1:09:29] of God
[1:09:32] because The Thirst is in let's go down
[1:09:34] to Hebrews 4 verse 9. they remaineth
[1:09:37] therefore a rest to the people of God
[1:09:38] for he that injured into his rest he
[1:09:41] also had ceased from his own works as
[1:09:44] God did from his
[1:09:46] lettuce labor therefore to enter to that
[1:09:48] restless and even men should fall off
[1:09:49] the same example unbelief and so what we
[1:09:51] see is when you enter in by faith then
[1:09:53] you cease from your own religion
[1:09:56] you stop trying and your own ability you
[1:10:00] stop trying to please God in own ability
[1:10:02] let me tell you something friends if
[1:10:04] you're wondering if you're still doing
[1:10:06] that how discouraged do you get when you
[1:10:07] make a mistake
[1:10:10] you make mistakes everyone still make
[1:10:11] mistakes
[1:10:12] good if you were already in that body
[1:10:15] I'm in trouble
[1:10:17] how discouraged do you get
[1:10:20] can get discouraging right what do you
[1:10:22] do
[1:10:24] you recognize friends that you're not
[1:10:27] doing this on your own you're not
[1:10:28] overcoming in your own ability and so
[1:10:31] you say Satan you might knock me down
[1:10:32] again but watch me stand back up on my
[1:10:35] feet I'm still taking God at his work
[1:10:37] he's gonna set me free from whatever
[1:10:38] addiction it is you have he's gonna set
[1:10:40] me free from whatever is coming against
[1:10:42] me I am born to be an overcomer I am
[1:10:45] born to kick you back into hell and I am
[1:10:47] not going to lay here and wallow
[1:10:51] my sin and my depression and my
[1:10:54] discouragement because I am not
[1:10:56] discouraged
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:10:58] oh my you ever you ever see someone
[1:11:00] getting knocked down and they just jump
[1:11:01] right back up and say whatever
[1:11:06] you need to be doing that friends
[1:11:09] Satan can knock you down he will
[1:11:10] sometime he knocked up
[1:11:12] proper down you know what you do you
[1:11:15] repent you get back up and you say you
[1:11:16] know what I'm still going through Satan
[1:11:18] come on watch if you want but I'm still
[1:11:20] going through
[1:11:23] but what you do we cease from our own
[1:11:24] words we cease from getting so done all
[1:11:26] I just try so hard
[1:11:28] God I don't know what to do I'm trying
[1:11:30] so hard
[1:11:32] he's saying stop trying so hard
[1:11:36] how about believing so hard
[1:11:40] that hurts your pride it does
[1:11:43] it's a pride thing friends
[1:11:45] you mean I'm not good enough I can't
[1:11:47] live good enough no that's why Calvary
[1:11:49] was for
[1:11:51] right you can't live good enough
[1:11:57] so why don't they cease the people they
[1:11:58] don't cease from their own Works in
[1:12:00] religion why because they don't trust
[1:12:04] because they don't believe is that what
[1:12:06] the children is or they came to the
[1:12:08] promised land and they didn't after all
[1:12:11] God had did all he did got him out of
[1:12:13] Egypt got the he fed them all the way
[1:12:15] through the Wilderness or everything
[1:12:16] they're going through got him across the
[1:12:18] Red Sea destroyed the Army behind us and
[1:12:21] all that stuff behind them and they get
[1:12:22] up to to the promise I said oh yeah but
[1:12:25] I know this is a little bit too much now
[1:12:29] and we'll look at that and we think are
[1:12:31] you serious
[1:12:33] right okay well let me bring it to 2023
[1:12:37] why are you not born again
[1:12:40] are you serious
[1:12:43] what can God not do
[1:12:45] look at look at all the things he's done
[1:12:47] in this day
[1:12:48] all the Miracles he's performed look at
[1:12:51] all the times he'd come and met you at
[1:12:52] church look at all the situations you've
[1:12:54] been in look at all the testimonies you
[1:12:55] have testimony after testimony testimony
[1:12:57] that tells you Jesus Christ is still the
[1:12:59] same today as he's ever been
[1:13:03] and you let Satan talk to you out of it
[1:13:05] well yeah it's not for you
[1:13:07] please
[1:13:09] it is for you
[1:13:11] it is
[1:13:12] that thirst in there proves it
[1:13:15] let's look at some of these folks who
[1:13:16] would not cease from their own Works in
[1:13:18] Acts 7 45 Stephen you don't know Steven
[1:13:21] right he's our brother
[1:13:23] he says this he's talking about David
[1:13:24] let's go to verse 46. he's talking about
[1:13:26] the days of David he said David who
[1:13:28] found favor before God and desired to
[1:13:30] find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob
[1:13:33] but Solomon built him a house
[1:13:36] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[1:13:39] temples made with hands I said the
[1:13:42] prophet
[1:13:43] Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot
[1:13:46] still what house will you build me saith
[1:13:48] the Lord or what is the place of my rest
[1:13:52] oh my that just oh what is he saying hey
[1:13:55] I appreciate the church I appreciate you
[1:13:57] building this great place very
[1:13:59] respectful It's a Wonderful Church of
[1:14:01] God
[1:14:02] all across the country across the world
[1:14:04] you see this Mama's Great Big Beautiful
[1:14:05] churches people are built
[1:14:09] he says is that the place of my arrest
[1:14:12] is this building the place of his rest
[1:14:15] is that Pew the place no
[1:14:18] no remember David says it's the
[1:14:20] Tabernacle
[1:14:21] it's not the building it's not the
[1:14:23] temple it's the Tabernacle it's that
[1:14:24] person inside because all God ever
[1:14:26] wanted was an individual walk
[1:14:28] relationship with you the individual
[1:14:32] just just stop off from all this other
[1:14:34] stuff quit offer me your religion quit
[1:14:36] offer me what what Mysteries you
[1:14:38] understand quit offering me how well you
[1:14:39] worship quit offering me how anointed
[1:14:41] you are quit offering me all these
[1:14:42] things this is periphery they're very
[1:14:44] necessary but like Paul said you can you
[1:14:46] can know all Mysteries you can be give
[1:14:48] your body to be burned and you can shout
[1:14:50] you can worship but if you don't have
[1:14:51] love you're you're nothing it doesn't
[1:14:54] count it's just a periphery around it
[1:14:56] but the main thing is you have to have
[1:14:58] that relationship in your heart and
[1:14:59] without that the rest of it ain't gonna
[1:15:01] do you a bit of good
[1:15:04] you gotta get inside you gotta get that
[1:15:06] that that's
[1:15:07] sometimes like brother Brian would
[1:15:09] described it like a garden with a statue
[1:15:10] and he said now that there's flowers in
[1:15:12] there you know they had this the garden
[1:15:14] is all beautiful but the statue is the
[1:15:16] main thing it's the statue of Christ
[1:15:18] right here living through without that
[1:15:20] the guard means nothing
[1:15:24] you can go to church it's church
[1:15:25] services I want some recently and
[1:15:27] there's so much shouting and jumping and
[1:15:29] worshiping oh is this amazing
[1:15:32] beautiful
[1:15:35] how many people thought that was the
[1:15:37] evidence that they were born again
[1:15:41] how many people thought well I know I'm
[1:15:43] a Christian look how I look at this
[1:15:44] anointing look how I shout look how I
[1:15:46] jump look I run look how I preach
[1:15:49] that's just the temple
[1:15:51] okay I get to the Tabernacle
[1:15:53] you should have a church this is a
[1:15:55] beautiful Church you have you should
[1:15:56] have it shows your love and respect for
[1:15:58] God
[1:15:59] but ain't gonna put you in a rapture
[1:16:03] it ain't
[1:16:06] he said Heaven is my throne and Earth of
[1:16:08] my foots to what house will you build me
[1:16:10] saith Lord what is the place of my rest
[1:16:11] hath not my handmade all these things
[1:16:15] is our fallen nature desire to cross
[1:16:19] that Chasm back into fellowship with God
[1:16:22] by our own works by our own ability
[1:16:26] Adam spoke of it with his fig leaves
[1:16:28] Cain spoke of over the altar
[1:16:30] denominations speak with it all the way
[1:16:32] down through time because we're going to
[1:16:34] take the word we're gonna add this and
[1:16:36] we see this little bit of Truth and now
[1:16:38] we have the truth and this is what it
[1:16:39] takes
[1:16:40] and that spirit is rampant around our
[1:16:42] message friends
[1:16:43] be aware of that
[1:16:46] then he said he says hath not my my hand
[1:16:48] made all these things he's stiff-necked
[1:16:50] an uncircumcised and heart and ears you
[1:16:52] do always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[1:16:54] father did so do you what's he saying
[1:16:57] you refuse to enter the rest you refuse
[1:16:59] to come until the rest that I provided
[1:17:01] because you want to do something
[1:17:02] yourself you want to provide your own
[1:17:04] your own rest you want to build your own
[1:17:07] art do you want to bring your beautiful
[1:17:08] religion you want to have King worship
[1:17:10] and accept it expect me to re to accept
[1:17:12] that but he said you always resist the
[1:17:13] Holy Ghost you only do it can resistance
[1:17:16] way back then in the beginning and
[1:17:17] Mankind has been resisting it all the
[1:17:19] way down ever since because we always
[1:17:21] think that God is not good enough to
[1:17:23] save us he's not strong enough without
[1:17:24] without our help we have to add
[1:17:27] something to it to prove to God
[1:17:28] something you don't have to prove
[1:17:30] anything to God except that you trust
[1:17:32] him and that
[1:17:33] you believe in and that you believe when
[1:17:35] he speaks to you and you hear his voice
[1:17:37] and you answer to it and you do what he
[1:17:39] asks you to do
[1:17:40] that's the relationship that he's
[1:17:42] looking for
[1:17:44] oh my
[1:17:46] that's what brother Brown said he said
[1:17:47] what is this Shekinah Glory today to
[1:17:49] break Beyond the Veil to see who God Is
[1:17:50] Standing before us
[1:17:52] see who God is standing here before us
[1:17:56] he said it's the pillar of fire he's
[1:17:58] veiled in human flesh
[1:18:02] that's where he's at what are you
[1:18:04] looking for you know what a lot of
[1:18:05] people let me just say something what if
[1:18:07] I was in a pillar of Fire
[1:18:09] appeared right there
[1:18:11] some of you would come and glued
[1:18:14] well friends do you not see him right
[1:18:17] there right there right there right
[1:18:19] there right there right there
[1:18:21] it's the pillar of fire inside us see if
[1:18:25] we if we really if that become a greater
[1:18:27] Revelation you come to church you'll
[1:18:28] have times a different attitude won't
[1:18:29] you
[1:18:30] you go about your life with a different
[1:18:33] attitude if you really recognize that
[1:18:35] one inside of you you are housing deity
[1:18:37] the very same Pillar of Fire that part
[1:18:39] of the Red Sea is inside of you the very
[1:18:40] same pillar fire that's Focus said let
[1:18:42] there be light and let there be the
[1:18:43] world it's housed inside of you it's
[1:18:45] right there it's not less it's the same
[1:18:48] thing
[1:18:49] but we see this human flesh
[1:18:53] he said now you realize there's a hidden
[1:18:55] place in Christ where you can be hid
[1:18:56] that all your enemies
[1:18:58] you love them
[1:19:01] you can't help it friends
[1:19:04] you can't help it but love your enemies
[1:19:06] because your nature inside of you is
[1:19:08] love
[1:19:11] solar fire is love
[1:19:14] there's something about it that you want
[1:19:16] people to love you you want to be lovely
[1:19:17] if you want people to be lovely you had
[1:19:19] to be love yourself if you put it
[1:19:21] oh
[1:19:22] come on it just believe that's what's
[1:19:25] the matter with the Church our country
[1:19:27] today there's too much to make
[1:19:29] believe in just religious works there's
[1:19:31] too many people making believe trying to
[1:19:33] impersonate Christianity trying to do
[1:19:36] something to act like Christians
[1:19:40] you haven't seen from their works if
[1:19:41] you're still trying to get Christian
[1:19:45] that won't work friend God knows that
[1:19:47] the devil knows it and people knows it
[1:19:49] you got to be genuine you got to be
[1:19:51] original and God will honor that so
[1:19:53] friends what you have to do is Cease
[1:19:54] from your own works and go behind the
[1:19:55] veil get to know Christ get that Born
[1:19:57] Again experience and you can find out
[1:19:58] that you are a genuine Christian you
[1:20:00] don't have to wonder anymore you don't
[1:20:01] have to look around say I wonder if I
[1:20:03] really am or not I'm sure trying really
[1:20:04] hard just cease from all that and just
[1:20:06] take God at his word
[1:20:09] all right
[1:20:11] oh my what does this look like a little
[1:20:13] bit let's go about Psalms 131
[1:20:16] and say well if I'm into what am I going
[1:20:18] to do am I going to shout him with a
[1:20:19] dancer but I'm preaching God and testify
[1:20:21] I'm going to sing I'm gonna do all these
[1:20:22] things you'll do all that but that don't
[1:20:23] count
[1:20:25] you can do that without being there
[1:20:27] you have to do these things you have to
[1:20:28] be led by the spirit and it will
[1:20:30] manifest that
[1:20:33] but friends that's not what knowing my
[1:20:36] eyes lofty neither do I exercise myself
[1:20:39] in great matters or if things too high
[1:20:41] for me surely I have behaved and quieted
[1:20:44] myself as a child that is leaned from
[1:20:47] his mother
[1:20:48] my soul is even as a winged child
[1:20:52] it's a place of rest
[1:20:54] you know what a child does a little kid
[1:20:56] the whole world revolves around them
[1:20:58] right I want this right now and I'm
[1:20:59] going to get it I'm gonna throw a hissy
[1:21:01] if I don't get it and they scream and
[1:21:02] shout and all that but what happens is a
[1:21:04] person matures they call them down at
[1:21:06] least this post well let me put that if
[1:21:08] they mature they do as you get older
[1:21:09] don't mean you're maturing
[1:21:12] but they're resting
[1:21:14] the trusting
[1:21:16] that's what it looks like to be in there
[1:21:18] friends
[1:21:20] that's what it looks something goes
[1:21:21] wrong in your family and all the whole
[1:21:23] world is going to fall apart
[1:21:25] something goes wrong at church oh the
[1:21:27] whole church is going to fall apart
[1:21:29] well my question is so what if it does
[1:21:34] what's that got to do with this
[1:21:37] my kids are going out to the world
[1:21:38] what's that going to do with this
[1:21:41] but but the pastor he's going through a
[1:21:42] midlife crime
[1:21:44] he's not but you just
[1:21:50] passionately doing this and he's doing
[1:21:52] that what am I supposed to do be like a
[1:21:54] winged child
[1:21:55] Trust
[1:21:57] just realize
[1:22:00] quit trying to fix it
[1:22:03] God's running this church God's running
[1:22:04] this he puts people in office he puts
[1:22:06] people
[1:22:08] play in places to take care and just be
[1:22:10] that
[1:22:11] person that's not whining and crying
[1:22:13] about every little thing
[1:22:17] I can tell you something for sure
[1:22:19] pastors love those kind of Christians
[1:22:23] because too many times
[1:22:24] we don't manifest that
[1:22:28] you know who else loves those little
[1:22:29] kind of Christians Deacons
[1:22:31] trustees
[1:22:33] song leaders you know why songwriters
[1:22:35] love that kind of person because I don't
[1:22:36] care what you're going through you come
[1:22:38] to church and you stand there you sit
[1:22:39] there and you worship and you praise God
[1:22:40] you don't sit there it's a long face
[1:22:42] like I don't feel like preaching I don't
[1:22:43] feel like singing tonight I'm just going
[1:22:45] to kind of sit here because I'm just in
[1:22:46] a bad mood I've had a rough day all
[1:22:48] right we'll take the take the pacifier
[1:22:50] out of your mouth so you can sing
[1:22:58] living an emotional Realm
[1:23:00] just all emotions that's how I feel let
[1:23:02] me tell you something you know what the
[1:23:03] whole world is based on right now you
[1:23:04] know why all this perversion is going on
[1:23:06] in the world because they base
[1:23:07] everything their truth is based on their
[1:23:09] feelings how do I feel right now and
[1:23:11] when you base your truth on feelings it

[1:23:24] until they don't feel like a Christian
[1:23:25] well
[1:23:27] what does that have to do with anything
[1:23:29] you don't feel like a Christian so that
[1:23:31] means you're not
[1:23:32] there's a lot of churches out there
[1:23:33] that'll teach you that
[1:23:35] Holy Spirit don't teach you that
[1:23:41] Isaiah 28 9 Whom Shall he teach
[1:23:43] knowledge Whom Shall he make to
[1:23:45] understand Doctrine then that a weave
[1:23:47] for the milk and drawn from the breath
[1:23:49] they quieted this
[1:23:52] same thing
[1:23:53] these are the ones each these ones he
[1:23:55] can show himself to he said John from

[1:24:07] that talking about he said I'm going to
[1:24:09] teach you line up online praise him on
[1:24:11] precept by staring by my
[1:24:13] Spirit that's what that's taught it
[1:24:14] don't mean you have to get up and speak
[1:24:15] in tongues to do it but it means it's a
[1:24:17] work of the spirit and he's teaching you
[1:24:19] The Voice is coming through the work of
[1:24:20] the spirit he's training he's teaching
[1:24:22] you his word he's teaching who he is by
[1:24:24] the spirit talking to you it's not just
[1:24:26] a man up here like me speaking to you
[1:24:27] just agree what I said or disagree with
[1:24:29] what I said but you actually hear the
[1:24:31] voice of God speaking to you it's just
[1:24:33] stammering lips and other tongues his
[1:24:35] voice is speaking to you recognize the
[1:24:36] voice of God and it might be one thing
[1:24:38] you hear today but you
[1:24:40] know that God came that still Small
[1:24:42] Voice and said something to you and you
[1:24:44] lashed on to that and that's what makes
[1:24:46] you a Believer you're sitting there
[1:24:47] amening me does not make you a Believer
[1:24:49] you sitting there agreeing with what I
[1:24:51] said doesn't make you a Believer but
[1:24:52] when you hear the voice of God speaking
[1:24:54] to them
[1:24:57] Street
[1:24:59] here she's like God had for me today and
[1:25:01] I'm gonna believe that and nothing's
[1:25:02] gonna talk me out of that that's what
[1:25:04] makes you a believer
[1:25:07] that's what it is for and it's good to
[1:25:09] say amen and what you do when you say
[1:25:10] man you say God I know he's speaking I
[1:25:12] regret what he said but I got to have
[1:25:14] something personal I need to hear
[1:25:15] something for you that's something more
[1:25:16] I agree what he's saying I love what
[1:25:18] he's saying brother Phil but I gotta
[1:25:19] hear from God and what right now you're
[1:25:21] saying isn't something resonating with
[1:25:24] me I need something more and you know
[1:25:25] what you do if you had that pull and you
[1:25:27] keep pulling and all of a sudden
[1:25:29] something just comes and it just anchors
[1:25:30] they say well where'd that come from
[1:25:32] because you you are pulling on the gift
[1:25:36] that's what you get friends that's what
[1:25:38] it means that's a personal walk it's an
[1:25:39] individual walk it's not everyone's
[1:25:41] getting the same thing no you as an
[1:25:43] individual are hearing the voice of God
[1:25:44] individually to you personally and it's
[1:25:47] just you and him and all of a sudden you
[1:25:48] might be saying that in that Pew but all
[1:25:51] of a sudden you recognize that you just
[1:25:52] been shut off from everything around you
[1:25:54] your wife ain't sitting there your
[1:25:55] husband
[1:25:56] they sitting there nobody's around you
[1:25:58] it's just you and God and you're just
[1:26:00] having this personal relationship
[1:26:01] sitting right there and that person
[1:26:02] beside you is wondering what they're
[1:26:04] gonna buy from Walmart and you're in a
[1:26:05] secret place with God shutting away from
[1:26:07] everything
[1:26:09] individually
[1:26:13] uh
[1:26:14] forward stammering lips and another
[1:26:16] tongue will speak to his people to him
[1:26:18] he said this is the rest wherewith you
[1:26:21] may cause aware to rest and this is the
[1:26:23] refreshing this is the rest what is it
[1:26:25] it's an individual walk it's just you
[1:26:27] and Christ Alone
[1:26:30] just by yourself
[1:26:35] than when your family falls apart you
[1:26:38] stay solid because your family wasn't in
[1:26:40] there with you
[1:26:41] when the church falls apart you sit
[1:26:43] there solid because the church wasn't in
[1:26:45] there with you when your health falls
[1:26:47] apart you sit there solid because your
[1:26:49] health wasn't in there with you
[1:26:54] brother Bram talked you know you about
[1:26:55] the The Boxcar that before it could be
[1:26:58] sealed the inspector came and he
[1:27:00] inspected it right he checked everything
[1:27:01] and then he sealed it closed the door he
[1:27:03] locked it
[1:27:04] you know what that inspector wasn't
[1:27:05] inspecting
[1:27:07] outside the boxcar
[1:27:10] he was looking what's inside that was
[1:27:12] the main thing and when the inside was
[1:27:14] ready it was ready to go yeah I was
[1:27:16] sitting watching a train recently go by
[1:27:18] and you know almost every car had
[1:27:20] graffiti on it
[1:27:24] look at your life how much graffiti has
[1:27:26] been sprayed on your life
[1:27:28] it might be ugly
[1:27:30] not calling you ugly
[1:27:35] but look at all this stuff look at all
[1:27:38] the scars look at all the things you
[1:27:39] have on the outside and you roll down
[1:27:41] the track and you Rattle and you get
[1:27:43] Creek and all this kind of noise inside
[1:27:44] everything is just solid
[1:27:47] everything's been locked away everything
[1:27:49] is just the way it's supposed to be and
[1:27:50] you know what the effect of the outside
[1:27:52] has had on the inside
[1:27:54] nothing
[1:27:56] that cargo on the inside is not thinking
[1:27:58] I wonder how much graffiti is outside
[1:28:00] I wonder how of what these tracks the to
[1:28:03] train stuff what if something goes on
[1:28:04] what if we have a wreck that's not
[1:28:05] worried about that at all because it
[1:28:07] knows it's been sealed
[1:28:14] this is the rest we may cause a way to
[1:28:16] rest and this is refreshing the words of
[1:28:18] the spirit working in you
[1:28:20] from first to the last
[1:28:22] you know his presence you know his voice
[1:28:23] Jesus said you know his voice
[1:28:29] to whom he said this is the rest words
[1:28:31] we make God's way to rest this is the
[1:28:33] refreshing
[1:28:35] and then those brutal words
[1:28:37] yet they would not
[1:28:41] brother this morning he said oh I would
[1:28:43] have hubby you like a mother
[1:28:45] overseer chicks
[1:28:48] but you would not
[1:28:51] they would not accept the rest they
[1:28:53] would not accept the real the revelation
[1:28:55] of the word for their day
[1:28:57] they had to have their own religion
[1:28:59] they loved their own religion more than
[1:29:01] their love truth
[1:29:06] makes them feel special makes them feel
[1:29:07] holy
[1:29:10] you can look around the message
[1:29:12] did you see what I'm talking about
[1:29:15] yeah they were not but the word of the
[1:29:17] Lord was unto them preaching upon
[1:29:18] precept precept upon principle line up
[1:29:20] online here a little there little that's
[1:29:22] the same thing
[1:29:24] it's the same thing it's a message
[1:29:28] it's the same word they're preaching the
[1:29:30] same message
[1:29:32] they think they're preaching what the
[1:29:34] prophet said they preach out of the same
[1:29:35] Bible they preach out of the same quotes
[1:29:39] but they refuse to let it be a work of
[1:29:42] the spirit
[1:29:43] it's their own religion
[1:29:47] that they might go and fall backward be
[1:29:50] broke snared and taken remember what
[1:29:51] David said was your way to escape the
[1:29:53] snares is to be hidden away in that
[1:29:56] secret place of his presence that's the
[1:29:58] only way to escape it
[1:30:01] they're not allowing
[1:30:03] they're not allowing God to to interpret
[1:30:07] the word by bringing it to pass they put
[1:30:08] their own interpretation to it and they
[1:30:10] present us look what a wonderful group
[1:30:11] of people we are look what God's doing
[1:30:13] on this and they do have they have they
[1:30:14] have signs of what does they absolutely
[1:30:15] do they have annoying things they have
[1:30:16] all these things otherwise it will not
[1:30:17] be deceptive
[1:30:19] for What's missing
[1:30:22] is that secret place because they have
[1:30:24] to look at themselves as a group well we
[1:30:26] believe this we believe this this is Who
[1:30:28] We Are
[1:30:33] Isaiah 30 and 6 he said the birth of the
[1:30:36] beast of the South into the land of
[1:30:37] trouble and anguish
[1:30:39] a land of trouble and anguish from Once
[1:30:40] come the young and old lion the Viper
[1:30:42] and fiery's flying serpent
[1:30:46] they will carry their riches upon the
[1:30:48] shoulders of young asses and their
[1:30:49] Treasures upon the Bunches of camels
[1:30:52] to a people that shall not profit them
[1:30:55] so what is then is he's talking to
[1:30:57] Israel and what they do they're ready to
[1:30:59] go down and they're still to stay their
[1:31:00] way out and you know they want to go
[1:31:01] down and get Egypt to help him he said
[1:31:03] that Egypt's help shall be in vain to no
[1:31:05] purpose and they did not trust the
[1:31:07] Jehovah they did not trust The God Who
[1:31:08] led him to this place they're not trust
[1:31:10] me so we're going to load up all our all
[1:31:11] our treasure our money and we're going
[1:31:13] to get help from the other some other
[1:31:14] denomination we're going to help from
[1:31:15] this church we're going to go and get
[1:31:16] help from mankind we're going to get
[1:31:18] help from another religion we're going
[1:31:19] to get help from the somebody else we're
[1:31:21] going to lean on our own help our own
[1:31:23] understanding
[1:31:24] he said that Egyptians shall help in
[1:31:26] vain into no purpose there have
[1:31:28] therefore have I cried concerning this
[1:31:30] their strength is to sit still
[1:31:35] man's help is vain
[1:31:38] you know why so many times your people
[1:31:40] will run to the pastor brother brother
[1:31:42] Tom's like
[1:31:44] this problem
[1:31:46] got the problem for you and he tells you
[1:31:49] the word of the Lord and you go out
[1:31:50] there think of that with just Thomas
[1:31:51] speaking
[1:31:55] and your your situation gets worse you
[1:31:57] say well I don't have any confidence
[1:31:58] brother Thomas anymore
[1:32:01] you shouldn't have had it in the
[1:32:02] beginning
[1:32:06] your your confidence isn't a gift to God
[1:32:09] that God placed there that he wanted to
[1:32:11] speak to you through but you would
[1:32:12] refuse that he told you because you
[1:32:14] didn't like what he said
[1:32:18] trusting in your own ability well I have
[1:32:20] a better idea than that brother Thomas
[1:32:21] okay
[1:32:23] see how that plays out
[1:32:25] just sit still your strength is to sit
[1:32:27] still and trust that God's got this all
[1:32:29] in control he's gonna take take care of
[1:32:31] it
[1:32:34] Isaiah 30 15 4 that's it the Lord God
[1:32:36] the Holy One of Israel in returning and
[1:32:37] rest shall ye be saved
[1:32:41] just return to God and rest that's all
[1:32:44] he's asking you to do return and rest in
[1:32:46] quietness and in confidence shall be
[1:32:49] your strength
[1:32:50] quietness
[1:32:52] well we need to have a meeting we need
[1:32:54] to discuss this we need to talk about
[1:32:55] this we need to someone needs to talk to
[1:32:56] this person about this someone needs to
[1:32:58] do this someone needs to do that
[1:32:59] someone needs to sit still and be quiet
[1:33:03] Ness and confidence
[1:33:07] he's got this
[1:33:09] he's got this friends he got you this
[1:33:11] far
[1:33:12] he brought you this far you think he
[1:33:14] just I'm done with you I'm gonna drop
[1:33:16] you I'm going to find someone else to
[1:33:17] play with
[1:33:19] he don't do that friends
[1:33:23] quietness and confidence shall be your
[1:33:24] strength
[1:33:26] and he would not
[1:33:28] that human nature I tell you what
[1:33:30] it's it's a beast it is a beast but he
[1:33:34] said no
[1:33:36] for we will flee upon horses therefore
[1:33:38] shall you
[1:33:39] we will right up on the Swift therefore
[1:33:42] shall they that pursue you be Swift
[1:33:48] heart and ears always resisting
[1:33:52] and it's the churches who do it
[1:33:54] it is
[1:33:56] Psalms 4 4 says
[1:33:58] stand in awe and sin not commune with
[1:34:01] your own hand upon your bed and be still
[1:34:02] you know what that word all means it
[1:34:04] means when you're stressed you're
[1:34:05] agitated you're quick and some things
[1:34:06] are going wrong he said stand there when
[1:34:08] you're agitated when you're stressed
[1:34:09] when things are going wrong and sin not
[1:34:11] you know what sin is it's unbelief what
[1:34:12] he's saying is
[1:34:15] dear you're stressed adult situation
[1:34:17] that's when you need an emotion
[1:34:18] communion with your heart look at your
[1:34:20] own heart and say is Christ in here am I
[1:34:22] Born Again I'm communing my own heart it
[1:34:24] means to communicate is it is this real
[1:34:26] what I have is it it's really the holy
[1:34:29] spirit in me and if it is and I'm gonna
[1:34:30] sit still and let God handle this
[1:34:32] situation even though it's stressed me
[1:34:34] out
[1:34:36] he said well if I'm at rest how can that
[1:34:38] be stressed I'm going to get to that in
[1:34:39] a second hold that thought Psalm 46 be
[1:34:42] still and know that I am God Be Still if
[1:34:44] you know he is God then sit still and
[1:34:47] let him fight for you he is a god of
[1:34:49] battles he is the one who will deliver
[1:34:50] you he was the one who will heal you why
[1:34:52] don't you let him do that but as long as
[1:34:54] you're fighting the battle he can't help
[1:34:56] you he can't fight get your hand out of
[1:34:59] there and you just take the soil and he
[1:35:01] puts it in her hand and you he gives
[1:35:03] that word and you start hacking with
[1:35:04] that word and all it is is faith
[1:35:07] it's just faith
[1:35:09] watch him come on the scene and destroy
[1:35:12] your enemies
[1:35:13] oh man how many of you could stand here
[1:35:15] and give testimony after testimony and
[1:35:18] when God has come in your life when
[1:35:20] you're at your wits in you did not know
[1:35:22] what to do and all of a sudden he shows
[1:35:24] up front on time and he sets you free
[1:35:28] oh man we've been here all day giving
[1:35:31] the testimonies of that and yet the next
[1:35:33] time something comes along
[1:35:36] what did we do two modes as they get to
[1:35:38] this red scene oh God what are we gonna
[1:35:41] do now
[1:35:43] why are you crying to me
[1:35:47] speak and go forward haven't I
[1:35:49] commissioned you this haven't I
[1:35:51] commissioned you to go in the Rapture
[1:35:52] haven't I ordained it on the Rapture now
[1:35:55] why are you whining about what you
[1:35:56] crying about speak and go forward speak
[1:35:59] to that devil kick him in the
[1:36:01] and then walk over him as you're heading
[1:36:04] for the rapture

[1:36:10] unto me all you that labor and a heavy
[1:36:12] laden I will give you rest you know what
[1:36:15] we're Laden with your heavy laborers our
[1:36:17] religion

[1:36:22] religion I'm trying so hard to be a
[1:36:24] Christian I'm trying so hard to be good
[1:36:26] I'm trying to quit doing this I'm trying
[1:36:27] to quit doing that
[1:36:31] you're resisting the Holy Ghost you
[1:36:34] stiff-necked message believer
[1:36:38] because you don't believe
[1:36:40] that he will do what he said he will do
[1:36:44] commune with your own heart is something
[1:36:45] in there pulling you is this God talking
[1:36:47] to you is this God doing this or is this
[1:36:50] just your own effort from your mind
[1:36:53] so my yoke is easy he said take my yoke
[1:36:55] upon you and learn of me I am making
[1:36:57] lowly in heart
[1:36:59] there's that quieted spirit
[1:37:01] I am meek and lowly I don't exercise
[1:37:03] much well brother Phil I can tell you
[1:37:05] all about the Seven Seals I can tell you
[1:37:06] about the seven Thunders I can tell you
[1:37:08] all about well can you tell me about the
[1:37:09] tribulation period
[1:37:12] because that's where you're going to be
[1:37:13] with that attitude

[1:37:22] my yoke is easy my burden is like yeah
[1:37:24] there's a yoke there's a burden what you
[1:37:26] have to do you have to believe what he
[1:37:27] tells you
[1:37:28] that's your battle
[1:37:30] but it's not your own works
[1:37:34] if your yoke is heavy if it's burdensome
[1:37:37] it's because you're trying to be a
[1:37:38] believer
[1:37:41] we're still trying
[1:37:45] I don't know what time I got out here
[1:37:59] Satan will use your trials
[1:38:02] to prove to you that you're
[1:38:04] not at rest
[1:38:07] if you're really at rest why are you so
[1:38:08] Torah
[1:38:10] if you really at rest why so much stress
[1:38:12] you can't even sleep sometime at night
[1:38:14] because this is bothering you that if
[1:38:15] you arrest what's that all about
[1:38:19] y'all remember the story of the
[1:38:20] shunamite woman
[1:38:23] she couldn't have a kid
[1:38:25] she had prayed about it countless times
[1:38:27] getting older her husband was really old
[1:38:30] she had resigned herself to the fact
[1:38:31] that I'm not going to have a child
[1:38:34] but then the prophet came along like and
[1:38:37] she said she said to her husband by the
[1:38:39] way Bob says she's a great woman
[1:38:41] strong woman
[1:38:43] all these people out in the world they
[1:38:44] want to say I'm a strong woman I want
[1:38:46] you to take your example from her she's
[1:38:47] a strong woman
[1:38:50] she said let's build him a little room
[1:38:51] let's do something for him
[1:38:54] she did
[1:38:55] Elisha said
[1:38:57] what does she need is anything I can do
[1:38:58] she said no nothing I'm good I'm happy
[1:39:00] to be here she had resigned herself to
[1:39:02] the fact that I got my husband we're
[1:39:04] gonna get old we're going to die I'm not
[1:39:06] gonna have a child yeah hazy told us you
[1:39:08] don't have a child get uh Elijah said
[1:39:10] this time next year you're going to have
[1:39:12] a child

[1:39:15] deceive me
[1:39:17] don't tease me like that I've already
[1:39:19] given up on that
[1:39:21] he said no but you're gonna have it
[1:39:23] she wasn't asking for it anymore
[1:39:25] she had resigned herself
[1:39:27] she had quieted herself
[1:39:29] this is God's will
[1:39:32] child came along
[1:39:34] can you imagine what it must have been
[1:39:35] like for that child he had Parents
[1:39:37] treating him like grandparents you know
[1:39:39] they did
[1:39:40] they spoiled that kid
[1:39:43] they got him everything they could just
[1:39:45] as happy
[1:39:47] and then he died
[1:39:51] what kind of a god
[1:39:54] would do that
[1:39:58] you would resign yourself okay I'm not
[1:40:00] going to have this child he comes on and
[1:40:01] said because you've been so good to my
[1:40:02] Prophet I'm gonna give you a child and
[1:40:04] then he takes him away
[1:40:06] ask Abraham
[1:40:16] she called into her husband and said
[1:40:18] send me I pray to one of the young men
[1:40:19] one of the asses on my run to God and
[1:40:22] come again he said wherefore will thy
[1:40:23] God then today it is neither new moon or
[1:40:26] Sabbath
[1:40:28] he had resigned he said what's the point
[1:40:30] let's just go to church let's go
[1:40:31] continue what we're doing
[1:40:34] she said I she said
[1:40:37] she said it shall be well
[1:40:39] she told her husband it shall be well
[1:40:41] well that means peace
[1:40:43] she said I'm going to have peace
[1:40:46] then she sat on an ass and said his
[1:40:48] servant drive and go forward slack not
[1:40:50] die writing except that baby she she
[1:40:51] went and came into the man of God to
[1:40:53] account Mount Carmel came to pass on the
[1:40:54] man of God saw her far off he said to go
[1:40:56] Haze his servant behold the Honors that
[1:40:58] shooting might run now I prayed thee to
[1:41:00] meet her and say unto her is it well
[1:41:01] with me is it will thy son is it thy
[1:41:03] husband as well with thy child
[1:41:07] she answered it as well
[1:41:09] we sing that song all is well we'll look
[1:41:12] at her as a hero we'll look at her look
[1:41:14] what she did her son had this situation
[1:41:16] that is described and God had taken that
[1:41:19] ripped her very hard out of her
[1:41:21] and yet she confessed all as well
[1:41:24] what a great woman
[1:41:27] that is not the end of the story
[1:41:33] and she came near the man of God to the
[1:41:35] hill she caught him by the feet because
[1:41:36] it came near to thrust your way and the
[1:41:38] man of God said leave her alone
[1:41:41] for her soul is vexed
[1:41:45] that word means bitter
[1:41:49] and the Lord had hid for me and hath not
[1:41:52] told me
[1:41:55] so we look at that we say well she must
[1:41:57] have been shouting and dancing I said
[1:41:59] all is well all is well wonderful I'm
[1:42:02] just so no no no no no she was acting
[1:42:04] just the way you would if you lost your
[1:42:06] 12 year old kid
[1:42:07] she was grieving bitterly
[1:42:10] she was tore up she couldn't sleep she
[1:42:13] had to run she had to get to the man of
[1:42:14] God and that worked her her testimony
[1:42:16] from my believer's heart was as well I
[1:42:19] have peace she said all is well I have
[1:42:22] peace in this situation but I'm bitter
[1:42:24] in my spirit I'm my mind is tore up and
[1:42:26] then she said to him did I desire a son
[1:42:29] of my Lord
[1:42:30] she said did I ask for this did I ask
[1:42:33] you give him I had to resigned myself I
[1:42:34] wasn't gonna have one and I said didn't
[1:42:36] I say do not deceive me
[1:42:39] play with me this way don't tell me I'm
[1:42:41] gonna have this because I resigned
[1:42:43] myself and then you gave him anyways and
[1:42:45] then you rip them away from me
[1:42:48] that my friend is where she was when she
[1:42:52] said all is well
[1:42:54] do you have that same testimony when
[1:42:57] everything's falling apart and you lost
[1:42:59] this one and your kids are doing
[1:43:00] whatever and things are just gone and
[1:43:01] the doctor said you got three weeks to
[1:43:03] live or your wife has cancer whatever
[1:43:05] and you look at that and you say I'm
[1:43:07] bitter in my spirit and I'm seeking God
[1:43:08] I say God what's going on and yet
[1:43:10] something inside just anchors there and
[1:43:13] say I have peace in the midst of this
[1:43:14] storm
[1:43:16] do you have that peace is that something
[1:43:19] that's real or is that something that
[1:43:20] you wish you had why don't you be honest
[1:43:22] with yourself
[1:43:26] just because you're in that secret place
[1:43:27] does not mean you don't have storms now
[1:43:30] David said in the midst of trouble
[1:43:31] that's when I seek that secret place
[1:43:33] that's what I had to get along with God
[1:43:35] that's why I got to get in there and
[1:43:36] find the answers that's when I had to
[1:43:37] get there and even when he don't answer
[1:43:39] Elijah says I don't even God has a told
[1:43:40] me what this is about and sometimes God
[1:43:42] doesn't tell you and sometimes you're
[1:43:43] going through something can you pray and
[1:43:46] you're praying and pray and he seems to
[1:43:47] be in miles away and you're going
[1:43:48] through a desert time he seems to be
[1:43:50] miles away he's thinking I gotta get an
[1:43:51] answer from God and you come to church
[1:43:53] and sure that he's gonna give it to you
[1:43:55] and he say silent and something else
[1:43:57] goes on and you're going a little
[1:43:58] further and you pray and you pray and he
[1:44:00] still sit silent brother Brown said
[1:44:02] that's when you need to be certain of
[1:44:04] God what is it that you know that he did
[1:44:06] this in your heart and if he did that
[1:44:07] one time that's all it takes he didn't
[1:44:09] do that and leave he can't leave you
[1:44:11] aren't sealed away he's never going to
[1:44:13] leave you he's just testing you to see
[1:44:15] if you gonna still say all is well
[1:44:19] because what he's proven to you is that
[1:44:22] well you have the goods he's proven to
[1:44:24] you that down his side that thing is
[1:44:26] still there
[1:44:27] it's not just to really just uh just a
[1:44:30] religion you have but if those tests
[1:44:32] prove that you are a Believer do you
[1:44:33] understand that do you see how how
[1:44:35] important those tests are those trials
[1:44:37] those Hard Times those troubles is
[1:44:39] because it proves to you who you are
[1:44:42] that's what it's about
[1:44:46] um
[1:44:47] he don't Vex you he don't call this just
[1:44:49] to do it he has a purpose you don't do
[1:44:51] it just for something to do
[1:44:57] David said this he said Psalm 10. why
[1:45:00] standeth thou far off O Lord why do you
[1:45:02] hide yourself in time and trouble
[1:45:04] you ever felt that
[1:45:06] well friends
[1:45:08] if he's always right there with you what
[1:45:10] kind of trouble would you have
[1:45:13] he has to do that
[1:45:15] he has to do that because if every time
[1:45:18] that a trouble came along his presence
[1:45:19] was just around you there's no trial
[1:45:23] there's no faith to that
[1:45:25] and so you have to look back and
[1:45:27] remember as many times he said when they
[1:45:29] came out of Egypt he said I'm gonna
[1:45:30] fight for
[1:45:32] remember what I did bring you out for
[1:45:34] Egypt remember what I did for you
[1:45:35] remember how I dealt with you here
[1:45:36] remember but right now I don't see you
[1:45:39] that's when you say all is well
[1:45:41] because you're still in that secret
[1:45:42] place though you don't feel like it
[1:45:45] Psalm 13. how long will you forget me
[1:45:48] Lord forever
[1:45:49] how long will I hide that face from me
[1:45:52] how long shall I take counseling my soul
[1:45:54] having sorrow my heart daily how long
[1:45:56] shall my enemy exalt over me consider
[1:45:58] and hear me oh Lord my God lighten my
[1:45:59] knives unless I sleep to sleep with
[1:46:00] death unless enemies say I have
[1:46:02] prevailed against him those that trouble
[1:46:03] me rejoice
[1:46:05] David's going through a hard time
[1:46:06] they've been through a lot of hard times
[1:46:08] but then he said but I have trusted in
[1:46:11] thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy
[1:46:13] salvation I will sing unto the Lord
[1:46:14] because he has dealt Bountiful in me
[1:46:16] bountifully with me in the midst of the
[1:46:17] trouble he said I'm still going to
[1:46:18] praise you I'm still going to go to
[1:46:20] church I'm still good still going to
[1:46:21] worship I'm still gonna say am I still
[1:46:23] gonna believe what you're doing because
[1:46:24] I know that you brought me this far and
[1:46:25] you promised to take me the rest of the
[1:46:27] way really quick I got two more things I
[1:46:29] want to look at in Song of Solomon the
[1:46:31] situations where talking about this
[1:46:33] truth that's the type of the Bride this
[1:46:34] this woman in here of course and so song
[1:46:37] was Solomon verse three I'm going to
[1:46:38] hurry up real quick so he said by night
[1:46:40] I uh By Night on my bed I saw him whom I
[1:46:43] so loveth I saw him but I found him not
[1:46:45] so here she is she is his bride she
[1:46:48] knows him at that secret place and she's
[1:46:49] there in bed and she's resting
[1:46:52] she's where she's supposed to be she's
[1:46:53] resting but in that place of rest sure
[1:46:56] her soul sought him but I couldn't find
[1:46:57] him he wasn't there I couldn't seem to
[1:46:59] pray through he seemed to be a long ways
[1:47:01] off and I just love and my soul lover
[1:47:03] that she knew that she was what we call
[1:47:05] born again this is a Believer this is
[1:47:08] the bride
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:12] but he's withdrawn himself she said I
[1:47:14] will rise now and go about the city and
[1:47:16] the streets and in the broad ways I was
[1:47:18] seeking whom my soul loveth I saw him
[1:47:20] but I found him not
[1:47:22] she's going to church she's going where
[1:47:24] she's supposed to be she's seeking him
[1:47:26] she wants it she's longing for this and
[1:47:28] then it says the Watchmen these are God
[1:47:30] sent ministers The Watchmen that go
[1:47:32] about the city found me
[1:47:35] they found
[1:47:36] money to whom I said saw you him whom I
[1:47:39] so loveth she's inquiring at his Temple
[1:47:42] she had come to the temple she said
[1:47:43] where is this guy I need a hold of him
[1:47:45] and the ministers were there and then it
[1:47:47] said
[1:47:48] it was but a little that I passed from
[1:47:50] them but I found him whom I so loveth
[1:47:54] what was it they had pointed her the way
[1:47:56] you were going to find Christ there he
[1:47:58] is right there see that altar that's
[1:48:00] where you'll find him
[1:48:03] but she had passed from them why because
[1:48:04] it wasn't her in the pastor it wasn't
[1:48:06] her in the minister it wasn't her and
[1:48:07] her family it was her all by herself
[1:48:10] you don't get to him by someone else
[1:48:12] with someone else going to when Rebecca
[1:48:14] come to Isaac it was Rebecca and Isaac
[1:48:16] in the tent it wasn't Rebecca and Isaac
[1:48:17] and Elias it wasn't Iraq and Isaac and
[1:48:19] and her mother-in-law it wasn't anything
[1:48:21] like that it was just those two and
[1:48:23] that's the way you're going to find
[1:48:23] Christ is when it's just you and him
[1:48:25] alone do you dare trust him to go there
[1:48:27] by yourself
[1:48:31] as soon as you found him
[1:48:33] should I held him would not let him go
[1:48:34] until I brought him into my mother's
[1:48:35] house into the Chamber of her that
[1:48:37] conceived me she hold on tight brother
[1:48:39] and sister she had such a thirst she
[1:48:41] knew him she loved him but there was a
[1:48:42] time when he wanted a deeper walk a more
[1:48:44] intimate walk with her and so he spurred
[1:48:46] that thirst inside and said why don't
[1:48:47] you come seek me seek me I got more of
[1:48:50] me to show you I got more I want to show
[1:48:52] you I want to show you my I want a
[1:48:53] deeper relationship with you
[1:49:02] foreign
[1:49:05] chapter five verse two same woman
[1:49:08] I sleep
[1:49:10] but my heart awaketh
[1:49:12] it is the voice of my beloved that
[1:49:14] knocketh behold I stand at the door not
[1:49:17] will you answer will you let me in but
[1:49:19] see she was asleep
[1:49:21] she wasn't not just resting she had gone
[1:49:23] to sleep
[1:49:24] she was satisfied
[1:49:29] not because he said what's my beloved
[1:49:32] that knock of saying open to me my
[1:49:34] sister my love my dad my undefined for
[1:49:35] my head is filled with Dew and my locks

[1:49:41] knocking here he's knocking there he
[1:49:43] said well someone opened to me well
[1:49:44] someone opened to me and he couldn't
[1:49:46] find it because all he was running to
[1:49:47] was false bride and people who sells
[1:49:49] sounds like I don't need this anymore I
[1:49:51] don't need the message of the art it's
[1:49:53] not true anyways he's looking for
[1:49:54] shelter where does he look for shelter
[1:49:56] the same place where you look for
[1:49:57] shelter because brother and sister that
[1:49:59] shall just finds us with you it's with
[1:50:00] you he Longs for that rest with you
[1:50:02] that's what he brought you here for so
[1:50:04] he could answer you so he could find out
[1:50:06] pipes of rest he said where's the place
[1:50:07] of my rest it's right there in you he
[1:50:09] wants to come to you he wants you to
[1:50:11] provide that that shelter to him that's
[1:50:13] why he provides it to us friends
[1:50:17] trying to hurry too much let me slow
[1:50:18] down
[1:50:20] you give him purpose
[1:50:23] the bride gives him purpose for being
[1:50:25] the whole thing was to get to this bride
[1:50:27] right here so he can marry you friends
[1:50:29] this is what his purpose is
[1:50:31] but she said I have put off my coat how
[1:50:33] should I put it on I have washed my feet
[1:50:35] how shall I defile them
[1:50:37] oh
[1:50:38] look at this laodice seeing spirit
[1:50:43] I'm Justified
[1:50:44] I've never done it I'm undefiled I'm
[1:50:47] pure I'm holy I have need of nothing
[1:50:50] she's been influenced by that spirit
[1:50:52] do I have to get up do I have to defile
[1:50:55] myself do I have to get dirty why don't
[1:50:56] I just sit and lay in my bed and just
[1:50:58] rest because he has something more for
[1:51:00] you
[1:51:04] self-satisfied she's complacent
[1:51:06] I preach I sing I go to church I pay my
[1:51:09] tithes I live a good life I live in
[1:51:11] Christ in my life I'm just sitting here
[1:51:12] waiting for the rapture
[1:51:15] you know what goes into Rapture the only
[1:51:17] thing brother Raph said the only thing
[1:51:18] that goes there is perfect love
[1:51:21] and you might have all these other
[1:51:22] things in place but if God's looking for
[1:51:24] more of you he wants more love he wants
[1:51:26] that perfect love to come in to manifest
[1:51:28] to express that love to you that's what
[1:51:29] he's trying to get us to do and we can
[1:51:31] sit back there and be complacent in our
[1:51:32] labor to see and age and be the bride of
[1:51:35] Christ and still be influenced by that
[1:51:39] have need of nothing what's missing it's
[1:51:40] a perfect love my beloved put in his
[1:51:42] hand by the hole of the door my bounds
[1:51:44] will move for me
[1:51:45] for him she loved him friends she knew
[1:51:48] him she died wrongs to open to my
[1:51:49] beloved my hands dripped with myrrh my
[1:51:51] fingers were sweet smelling Miracle on
[1:51:53] the hand of the luck look how impressed
[1:51:54] she was with her own religion look how
[1:51:57] old I am look at the worship I have just
[1:51:58] me and God together
[1:52:03] I opened my to my beloved
[1:52:06] but my beloved hands withdrawn himself
[1:52:08] was gone my soul failed when he spoke I
[1:52:10] saw him I could not find him I caught
[1:52:12] him but he gave no answer
[1:52:15] withdrawn himself
[1:52:18] The Watchmen that went about the city
[1:52:20] found me
[1:52:22] this time they smote me
[1:52:25] they wounded me
[1:52:27] the keepers of the water
[1:52:29] away my veil from me
[1:52:31] she needed chastening this is when she
[1:52:33] came to church and this the preacher
[1:52:35] just skinned her High said use don't you
[1:52:38] sit there in that Pew be complacent
[1:52:39] don't sit there thinking well I got it
[1:52:41] all all together I'm ready to go on the
[1:52:42] Rapture friends if you ever get to that
[1:52:44] point recognize that you are heavily
[1:52:45] influenced by the wrong Spirit by
[1:52:47] religious layout of sin Spirit when you
[1:52:49] come to church you should have such a
[1:52:51] thirst for more of God you said when
[1:52:52] you're going about your day there's a
[1:52:53] thirsty and there's some not something
[1:52:55] you put in yourself don't work it up or
[1:52:56] I'm gonna thirst for God no you're not
[1:52:58] you're gonna make yourself miserable
[1:52:59] what you're going to do is you're going
[1:53:00] to get all that other junk out of the
[1:53:02] way so that thirst can come through and
[1:53:03] draw you to God because that's the way
[1:53:05] the bride is she just wants more of him
[1:53:09] she just wants to know him more
[1:53:13] it's that thirst in this and Devil's
[1:53:15] trying to get you to to
[1:53:17] lukewarm to just calm down and just like
[1:53:19] well I'm good to go he said it is a
[1:53:21] place of restaurant it is a place of
[1:53:23] rest but it's in that love it's not in
[1:53:24] some lukewarm complacent attitude
[1:53:26] she said I charge you all Daughters of
[1:53:28] Jerusalem if you find my beloved that
[1:53:30] you tell him that I am sick of love
[1:53:32] which means she can't she's just growing
[1:53:34] crazy she's losing her mind
[1:53:38] let me read you this one more quote
[1:53:44] he said there's something brother Braham
[1:53:46] says he said something beyond the
[1:53:47] villiana that pulls a Christian
[1:53:49] he can't explain it
[1:53:51] he don't understand it himself
[1:53:54] but there's something in that Fellowship
[1:53:56] that he had with Christ sever him from
