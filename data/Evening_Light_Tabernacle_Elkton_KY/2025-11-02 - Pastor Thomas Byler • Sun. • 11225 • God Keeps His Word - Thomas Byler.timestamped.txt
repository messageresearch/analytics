[42:16] Amen. If you could just continue to play
[42:18] that softly. You may have your seats.
[42:20] Brother Danny, Brother Michael, John,
[42:21] Brother Paul, if you'd come for the
[42:22] offering this morning.
[42:29] Amen. We have a number of prayer
[42:30] requests.
[42:32] Amen. Brother David asked if we would
[42:34] remember a friend [music] of his, Josh,
[42:36] who's his friend, Matthew Pierce, took
[42:39] his life. So, just remember them [music]
[42:41] in this time for the family's grieving
[42:43] and said it hit him pretty hard. So, we
[42:45] also want to remember sister Janette.
[42:48] She asked, "Will you please remember me
[42:49] in prayer on Wednesday, I have to go to
[42:51] St. Thomas West for a night hard cath?"
[42:55] So, we want to remember her this coming
[42:57] Wednesday. And also, Sister Alicia's
[42:59] dad, Gary, is going to Louisville for a
[43:02] surgery this week. So, we want to
[43:03] remember him. Amen. I believe Brother
[43:05] Brad has some requests as well.
[43:11] Amen.
[43:14] We serve a big mighty God.
[43:17] And you know the prophet, we've been
[43:19] taught, the world's not taught this, but
[43:21] we've been taught that if we'll just
[43:23] believe, not even cancer can [music]
[43:26] stand in the way. How many believes that
[43:28] this morning? We have some these needs
[43:31] and some more. We want to remember uh
[43:33] Austin's girls and [music] and they're
[43:35] still it's been a week and they've just
[43:37] really been sick and and any of you has
[43:39] ever raised small children, you know,
[43:41] that's no fun and stressful and so just
[43:43] remember them. I think they they tested
[43:45] for for flu. So, uh, we definitely want
[43:48] you to [music] to remember them and hold
[43:49] them up. Brother Joe's not feeling well
[43:51] this morning. And the other need that we
[43:53] have is, uh, you know, many of us know,
[43:56] brother Nathan and sister Tracy Ball,
[43:58] their daughter McCagan Pascal. She's
[44:01] carrying, uh, twins. And the doctor's
[44:04] not giving her a report that that we
[44:06] agree with. And so, they've they've
[44:09] asked us to remember them in prayer.
[44:11] Brother Nathan, he texts [music] and
[44:12] called or texts and I talked to him the
[44:14] other day and and they're they're
[44:16] carrying identical twins and what's
[44:18] going on is one of the one of the twins
[44:20] is just not growing at the same rate.
[44:22] Well, the doctors at Vanderbilt who are
[44:24] supposed to be the best, they just
[44:26] encouraged her to abort one. [music]
[44:30] They don't want to do that. We're not
[44:31] going to do that. And so they want us to
[44:34] bind our faith and and bind our our
[44:36] spirits together and believe as she's
[44:39] going to be traveling to Cincinnati in
[44:41] the morning. They decided to go to a
[44:43] different doctor and just didn't want to
[44:45] accept that report. So they're going to
[44:47] Cincinnati and the doctors at Cincinnati
[44:50] are need to do some measurements [music]
[44:51] and take some uh uh readings and stuff
[44:54] to see if they can do I think it's
[44:56] called a infant transplant maybe. And uh
[45:01] it's it's a procedure I'm not familiar
[45:03] with, but it's a very delicate, very
[45:04] serious procedure. And she's got to meet
[45:07] certain requirements those babies do for
[45:09] them to be able to do that. So they need
[45:11] your prayers. And if if cancer won't
[45:14] stand in the way of our God, neither can
[45:16] this. So we're just going to bind our
[45:18] faith this morning. We're going to
[45:20] believe with each other. So how many has
[45:22] a need?
[45:24] While you're sitting there this morning
[45:25] with your neighbor, just just won't you
[45:28] just lay hands on your neighbor and as I
[45:30] pray, we're just all going to pray and
[45:32] believe for this [music] need and each
[45:34] need that was brought before the Lord,
[45:36] unspoken and spoken. So, let's just bow
[45:38] our heads. Heavenly Father, we come
[45:40] before you this morning, Lord. Lord, we
[45:42] we we just bow our hearts humbly before
[45:45] you, Lord, knowing that you're the God
[45:48] of all, that you're a God of all
[45:50] creation, that you're the creator,
[45:52] you're the maker. Father, you you know
[45:54] our needs before we even know our needs.
[45:56] And you've heard the needs of the
[45:57] people. You heard the need of the family
[45:59] that's grieving this morning over the
[46:01] loss of a loved one who apparently just
[46:03] couldn't handle the pressures, Lord. And
[46:05] we know we're in a pressure a pressure
[46:07] cooker in this world we live in. But
[46:09] Father, we know that you're more than
[46:10] able to meet the needs, Lord. So, go to
[46:13] that grieving family this morning. and
[46:14] you heard the needs of our sisters and
[46:16] [music]
[46:17] uh sister Janette that has to go to the
[46:18] specialist in the morning and just needs
[46:21] a a sincere touch from you, Father. That
[46:23] you would present yourself as healer to
[46:25] her that you would just uh lead and
[46:27] guide the doctors to direct that all
[46:29] things could be [music] treatments would
[46:31] be to just give her comfort, Lord Jesus,
[46:33] and and help her in this time, Lord.
[46:35] Lord, we just ask, Father, that you
[46:37] would just meet each and every one of
[46:38] those needs, [music] Lord. the other
[46:40] ones that's been mentioned with with the
[46:42] the little uh sailor and haven and
[46:44] serenity not feeling well. And we just
[46:46] ask Lord that we're ready to to just
[46:48] kick the devil out and say enough's
[46:50] enough. And that's what we've been
[46:52] taught that when when there comes a
[46:54] certain point, God will allow Satan to
[46:56] do so much, but when it's enough, it's
[46:58] enough. And God steps in. So Lord, we're
[47:00] calling on you to step in on that this
[47:02] morning. And Lord, for the the babies
[47:04] that are being carried and [music] by
[47:06] McCagan, Lord, and such a such a
[47:10] important need, Lord Jesus, that you
[47:12] would just go and minister to that
[47:14] [music] uh body, Lord Jesus. And Lord,
[47:16] we we don't understand. We don't know.
[47:18] We don't know why things happen the way
[47:20] they do, but we know that you're in
[47:22] control and you have the answers, Lord.
[47:24] So, we trust and we believe and we bind
[47:26] our faith and we lay hands on one
[47:29] another because we all have needs. And
[47:30] so [music] with the with the with the
[47:32] lick of fire that we have bound
[47:34] together, Lord, it's just a blazing
[47:36] bonfire, Lord. And we call upon you and
[47:38] ask that you would move in that need in
[47:40] a very special way. That you would just
[47:41] lead and guide and direct the doctors
[47:43] and the surgeons that'll be uh
[47:45] overlooking this case and be trying to
[47:47] figure out how can we how can they save
[47:49] these babies? And Lord, we just ask Lord
[47:52] as we commit it into your hands that you

[47:55] their hands, and their thoughts [music]

[48:09] Lord, that you would bless this offering
[48:11] now as the [music] people give and they

[48:16] offering would just be to bring glory to
[48:18] you and to further your kingdom. Father,

[56:26] is.
[56:29] All right.

[57:01] there. Amen. Different administrations
[57:04] and helps and so forth and how that when
[57:06] everybody does their part, it just works
[57:08] so good together for good. Amen. And me
[57:11] and my wife, there's very little that we

[58:58] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[59:01] God is good, isn't he?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] Amen. Certainly is good to be in the
[59:09] house of the Lord and
[59:12] be led by the spirit.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just be seated for a minute. I
[59:17] want to make an announcement this
[59:18] morning. Amen. That after about 34 years
[59:22] of doing things a certain way. I've kind
[59:25] of had it on my heart. Amen. A little
[59:27] bit about making some changes in the way
[59:29] that we do things. Amen. And so I talked
[59:32] to the board about it and they're okay
[59:34] if they they're okay with it if I feel
[59:36] let to go this way. And so uh I want to
[59:39] just uh maybe talk to you about the
[59:42] changes we'd like to make. Amen. For one
[59:45] thing, I know that when we get here many
[59:47] times, Amen. if we're 30 minutes early,
[59:51] uh that's around 10:00 and then a lot of
[59:53] times before we ever get to the
[59:55] preaching, it could be almost an hour
[59:57] and a half later. Amen. So, Amen. And I
[1:00:00] know we can maybe narrow that down a
[1:00:02] little bit uh to where perhaps we'll
[1:00:04] have more time for the ministering of
[1:00:06] the word. Um so what I'd like to do is
[1:00:11] change our service uh Sunday school the
[1:00:15] way that we do our kids children's
[1:00:17] Sunday school. And uh hopefully if I
[1:00:20] don't make myself clear and somebody
[1:00:21] gets a question about this, don't be
[1:00:23] afraid to ask me after service. Okay?
[1:00:26] But uh if the parents of the children
[1:00:30] that have Sunday school, if you could be
[1:00:31] here by 10 after 10, 10 after 10 or
[1:00:35] maybe a little before that, 5 after 10.
[1:00:38] We're supposed to be here 30 minutes
[1:00:40] early, right? So I should say let's be
[1:00:42] here at 10:00 if we possibly can. And
[1:00:44] let's have our children's Sunday school
[1:00:46] class starts at 10 after 10 and dismiss
[1:00:50] at 25 after 10. Amen. That gives you
[1:00:53] five minutes for everybody to come in
[1:00:55] here and sit down. Amen. And begin for
[1:00:58] the worship service. Amen. And I would
[1:01:01] like for our pre-ervice music to start
[1:01:04] around 20 after. Amen. Right. I'd like
[1:01:07] to have that maybe start about 20 after
[1:01:09] as we usually do. Amen. When we don't
[1:01:11] have Sunday school or like on the on the
[1:01:14] first Sunday of the month, I believe it
[1:01:15] was. But
[1:01:18] uh so be dismissed. And then also by
[1:01:21] doing this, by having three Sunday
[1:01:23] school classes going out there or Yeah,
[1:01:26] there's three of them. Uh when we come
[1:01:29] in, Amen. we're going to have to cut out
[1:01:31] our previsiting noise,
[1:01:35] pre-ervice visiting. Okay? Because we
[1:01:38] don't want a lot of people out there
[1:01:39] talking and everything else like that.
[1:01:41] Amen. When their teachers are trying to
[1:01:43] teach something. Does that make sense?
[1:01:45] Amen. So, let's fellowship afterwards if
[1:01:47] we can. So, we'll come in here very
[1:01:49] quietly, very reverently. Amen. And uh
[1:01:53] uh that way it's just a real atmosphere.
[1:01:55] And like I told some of the board, I'd
[1:01:57] like for we want to create a real good
[1:02:00] atmosphere when we come up when we start
[1:02:02] service. I always like for the song
[1:02:04] leaders, of course, they're they can do
[1:02:06] as they feel led, but I like when I come
[1:02:08] up is to pick up on whatever song's
[1:02:11] being sent sung by Sister Becky or
[1:02:13] whatever and just enter into a real deep
[1:02:16] sincere worship right off the go get.
[1:02:18] Amen. And then uh maybe have a song or
[1:02:21] something or song or two or whatever it
[1:02:23] might be. Uh, now this this is one part
[1:02:25] that I haven't really uh got exactly
[1:02:30] clear in the way that we're going to do
[1:02:31] it yet, but I do know we have Bible
[1:02:34] reading. We have Bible reading. Uh,
[1:02:36] usually have Bible reading up here. And
[1:02:39] we'll and if the musicians are already
[1:02:41] up here, we don't want them to all go
[1:02:43] back down just for the Bible reading. So
[1:02:46] maybe we'll have to have Brother Troy or
[1:02:48] whoever does the Bible to have go back
[1:02:50] there and make sure that they know
[1:02:52] exactly where you're going to be at. so
[1:02:53] that we can put on the screen so that
[1:02:55] our musicians can actually either just
[1:02:59] look on there or bring their Bible up
[1:03:01] and read along with the scriptures. So,
[1:03:03] we won't cut that out, but I'd like to
[1:03:05] maybe cut out completely the adult
[1:03:07] Sunday school class. Okay? No, no adult
[1:03:11] Sunday school class. Amen. So, I talked
[1:03:13] to Brother Brian about this because this
[1:03:15] is something he's done for a very long
[1:03:16] time and he's done well and we
[1:03:18] appreciate all he has done. How many
[1:03:20] appreciates, Brother Brian? Amen. That's
[1:03:22] God bless you, brother Brian. We love
[1:03:23] Brother Brian. [applause]
[1:03:26] Amen. Brother B. Brother Brian's been a
[1:03:28] right-hand mind of mine. Amen. As far as
[1:03:31] Amen. Being a pillar of the church here,
[1:03:32] him and sisters are in that boat. And we
[1:03:34] really, really appreciate him. Amen. And
[1:03:36] I'll tell you what, I'll go to any
[1:03:38] battle any day with that soldier right
[1:03:40] there. Amen. He never He don't leave you
[1:03:42] nor does he forsake you. We appreciate
[1:03:44] him. Amen. But anyway, so I felt like
[1:03:47] maybe we might make these changes. Would
[1:03:49] that sound okay with everybody? and just
[1:03:51] so that our worship service comes up and
[1:03:53] then the you know all of our Sunday
[1:03:56] school is done by 25 after 10. Amen. For
[1:03:59] the little children, the younger kids
[1:04:01] and so forth. Um
[1:04:04] so anyway, let me see here.
[1:04:11] That's right. I can't think of anything
[1:04:13] else right now. So the the teachers of
[1:04:16] course be at your post and then have
[1:04:19] your children just come in and like like
[1:04:22] I said 10 after or so. Amen. Just go in
[1:04:25] there to the Sunday school and do that.
[1:04:26] Amen. Praise the Lord. And also so
[1:04:29] that's all for that. I want to also
[1:04:33] uh thank the church. Amen. I didn't go
[1:04:36] back brother John and look at your uh
[1:04:39] text but I think the total amount that
[1:04:41] we have paid for Amen. the rock back
[1:04:44] there on behind the fellowship hall was
[1:04:46] around 15,700
[1:04:49] somewhere in there. Amen. And last week
[1:04:51] we had around 6,700.
[1:04:53] Amen. And we got all that we needed
[1:04:55] right to the penny of what we needed to
[1:04:57] pay the rock. So let's give the Lord a
[1:04:58] hand for providing for that. [applause]
[1:05:00] Amen.
[1:05:05] Amen. Uh I've got a number on the
[1:05:08] church. Amen. from Dwayne Dead Light
[1:05:11] Dead Dwayne Dead Wallard. This is a
[1:05:13] little tongue twister, but anyway, he
[1:05:15] give me a price on the roof. Now,
[1:05:17] brother Brad, I don't know if you've got
[1:05:18] prices, but sometime if you have prices,
[1:05:20] Amen. We'll bring that before the
[1:05:22] church. But right now, we're standing at
[1:05:23] $30,000 for a shingle roof to be put
[1:05:27] back. 37,000 for a just your lowgrade
[1:05:30] metal, you know, and he didn't really
[1:05:32] recommend that because of screws that
[1:05:34] like to back out. If you go with metal,
[1:05:37] it's best to go with the self-standing.
[1:05:39] Amen. The very good stuff, which A mean
[1:05:41] you'll never have to deal with a roofing
[1:05:43] again. Amen. And you can fix that, I
[1:05:45] guess, in just portions or or whatever
[1:05:47] if you needed to. But that is $57,000.
[1:05:51] So, I don't know. You know, we're I'm
[1:05:53] going to talk to the board about it.
[1:05:55] Amen. And we're going to see what they
[1:05:56] think about it. And then we'll I guess
[1:05:58] ask y'all, you know, or get some of
[1:06:00] y'all's input. Do we want to go with
[1:06:02] another? Because it's lasted around 25
[1:06:04] thou 25,000.
[1:06:07] 25 years. Amen. We're not in heaven yet,
[1:06:11] but around 25 years, I guess it was,
[1:06:13] Brother Ryan. Right. Pretty close to it.
[1:06:15] Anyway, that these shingles have lasted.
[1:06:17] So, Amen. As a lot of us won't have to
[1:06:19] worry about putting another roof on if
[1:06:21] we go ahead with the cheaper one, have
[1:06:23] it throw it on. Amen. And let u you
[1:06:26] know, Woody's kids worry about it later
[1:06:27] on.
[1:06:31] But anyway, uh so I I kind of lean
[1:06:34] towards that. I kind of lean towards
[1:06:36] just doing a single again. But if y'all
[1:06:39] want a really expensive roof, I guess
[1:06:40] all of us are going to be paying for it.
[1:06:42] So, uh we'll just decide and we'll also
[1:06:45] just bring it before the board. Micah
[1:06:47] and Austin sitting back there, they have
[1:06:49] said that they would be a trustee. The
[1:06:50] board said they're all for it. Y'all
[1:06:53] like that idea?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I don't know if I'll wait till
[1:06:56] the first of the year. I guess I might
[1:06:58] wait till the next voting in January,
[1:07:00] which is just about two months away. I
[1:07:02] was just going to do it right away, but
[1:07:03] I'll just ask the Lord what he wants me
[1:07:05] to do on that because we could
[1:07:06] definitely use a couple more trustees.
[1:07:08] Amen. So, we appreciate them. Amen.
[1:07:11] Doing that. God bless you richly. Amen.
[1:07:13] For helping in that way.
[1:07:17] And that's all I can think of for now.
[1:07:19] Let's stand and go before the Lord in
[1:07:21] prayer.
[1:07:26] Amen. and pray. Certainly enjoyed the
[1:07:28] message Wednesday. He'll be taking this
[1:07:31] coming Wednesday again and then in the
[1:07:32] next week or so, brother Pedley will be
[1:07:34] with us and also brother.
[1:07:43] Yeah. Thank you, brother Andrew. Brother
[1:07:45] Andrew is going to be back on a
[1:07:47] Wednesday night here in a couple of
[1:07:48] weeks also. So, we're looking forward to
[1:07:50] that.
[1:07:52] Amen. Hopefully, you haven't been so
[1:07:55] busy now that you haven't had time to
[1:07:56] pray. Amen. Because how many knows that
[1:07:59] this is the most important part, amen,
[1:08:01] of our lives right here is the word of
[1:08:04] God. Amen. So, let's bow our heads
[1:08:06] before the master, Lord Jesus, as we
[1:08:08] come before you. Bowing our heads, Lord
[1:08:10] Jesus, in humble reverence and respect,
[1:08:13] Father, to you. And Lord Jesus, so
[1:08:17] standing in awe of you, Lord Jesus,
[1:08:21] desiring, Lord Jesus, that you'll
[1:08:23] continue to lead the church here,
[1:08:24] Father. Lead each one, Father, by your
[1:08:28] spirit, by your angel. We ask God that
[1:08:31] you just help us, Lord Jesus, to
[1:08:32] surrender to you now, Lord, this morning
[1:08:35] in a special way and help us to deliver
[1:08:37] what you feel. We feel God, you've laid
[1:08:39] upon our hearts to minister, Lord Jesus.
[1:08:41] Give us the ability that only you can
[1:08:43] give, Lord Jesus. Come and speak, Lord
[1:08:46] Jesus. You be the speaker this morning,
[1:08:48] Father. Be in the ears of the hearers,
[1:08:50] Lord Jesus. And we ask God that you just
[1:08:53] bless the port this portion of the
[1:08:54] service now as we commit it to you and
[1:08:57] the reading of the word in Jesus' name.
[1:08:59] And everybody said,
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Turn your Bibles if you will. Amen. And
[1:09:05] we think we will go to
[1:09:11] Isaiah. Let's go to Isaiah if we could.
[1:09:16] Amen.
[1:09:29] Amen. I really enjoyed the Lord laying
[1:09:32] that on my heart last week. the conflict
[1:09:34] between God and Satan. Amen. And I'm
[1:09:38] still just hardly can get away from it.
[1:09:41] And so I may end up Amen. speaking on it
[1:09:44] just a little bit again, tying it in
[1:09:46] with today a little bit. But Isaiah
[1:09:50] 55.
[1:09:52] Isaiah 55.
[1:09:57] My message this morning
[1:10:00] is going to be called God keeps his
[1:10:04] word. God keeps his word. Amen.
[1:10:09] His promises. I mean, he believes that
[1:10:11] God keeps his promises.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe he was said that. Amen.
[1:10:16] When he went to deliver Israel from
[1:10:18] Egypt, I remember my promise. I remember
[1:10:20] my covenant that I've made with you.
[1:10:22] Amen. I believe over another place in
[1:10:24] Malachi. Amen.
[1:10:28] In Malachi, he said something to the
[1:10:30] extent. He says, "They that feared the
[1:10:33] Lord spake often one to another, and the
[1:10:36] Lord hearkened and heard it in a book of
[1:10:40] remembrance." Amen. Was written before
[1:10:43] him for them that feared the Lord and
[1:10:46] that thought upon his name. And they
[1:10:48] shall be mine, sayaeth the Lord of
[1:10:50] hosts, in the day. Amen. When I make up
[1:10:54] my jewels, I will spare them as a man
[1:10:56] spareth his own son that serveth him.
[1:10:59] Amen. Amen. I just now think of that
[1:11:02] song. Amen. When my savior calls, Amen.
[1:11:06] I will answer. When he calls for me, I
[1:11:09] will hear. Amen. How many believes that
[1:11:10] God's going to do that one of these
[1:11:12] days? He's going to remember. He ain't
[1:11:14] going to forget his promises. Amen.
[1:11:16] Amen. And so, we really appreciate the
[1:11:19] Lord. I do not know what I would do if
[1:11:21] it wasn't as brother Brandham even said
[1:11:23] be for being able to be a Christian.
[1:11:25] Amen. How blessed we are. Isaiah 55 and
[1:11:30] verse 7. Let's go with verse six. Seek
[1:11:34] ye the Lord while he may be found. Call
[1:11:37] upon him while he is near.
[1:11:40] Amen. Boy, don't the world need to hear
[1:11:42] that right about now? Because how many
[1:11:45] knows the time is coming when they'll
[1:11:47] call and I won't answer. They'll plead,
[1:11:51] they'll pray, but I won't hear. He'll
[1:11:54] laugh at their calamity because when he
[1:11:55] did call, they would not answer. When he
[1:11:58] reached out his hand, he would not hear.
[1:12:01] So my I don't know if there would be
[1:12:02] anybody out there listening to this or
[1:12:04] not. Amen.
[1:12:08] Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
[1:12:11] unrighteous man his thoughts, and let
[1:12:12] him return unto the Lord, and he will
[1:12:15] have mercy upon him, and to our God, for
[1:12:17] he will abandonedly pardon. For my
[1:12:20] thoughts are not your thoughts, and
[1:12:21] neither are my ways your ways, sayeth
[1:12:23] the Lord. For as the heavens are higher
[1:12:25] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[1:12:27] than your ways, and my thoughts than
[1:12:30] your thoughts. For as the rain cometh
[1:12:32] down, and the snow of heaven, and
[1:12:33] returneth not thither, but waterth the
[1:12:35] earth, and maketh it to bring forth, and
[1:12:37] bud that it may give seed to the sewer,
[1:12:39] and bread to, so shall my word be, that
[1:12:43] goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall
[1:12:45] not return unto me void, but it shall
[1:12:47] accomplish that which I please, and it
[1:12:49] shall prosper in the thing that I
[1:12:51] whereto I shall send it. Amen. May God
[1:12:55] add his blessings to the reading of the
[1:12:56] word. You can be seated.
[1:13:03] Amen.
[1:13:07] Jesus himself, I believe he said that
[1:13:09] heavens and earth shall pass away, but
[1:13:11] my word shall never pass away. If you'll
[1:13:16] listen to uh if you'll listen to that
[1:13:20] about six different messages brother
[1:13:22] Brandham preached on God keeps God keeps
[1:13:25] his word you'll find that brother
[1:13:27] Brandham really uh was was was being led
[1:13:30] of God to come against
[1:13:34] uh some emotional
[1:13:36] uh things and emotion and uh things like
[1:13:40] the people that were supposedly had
[1:13:43] blood in their hands and so forth and
[1:13:45] Amen. They'd lay their hands on the
[1:13:47] people and so forth and talked about
[1:13:48] that blood would heal the nations.
[1:13:50] There's things like that and and oil
[1:13:52] that would come forth from of them. And
[1:13:54] he was really blasting at saying that's
[1:13:57] not of God. Amen. And it's causing it's
[1:14:00] going to cause the church to be confused
[1:14:02] and it's going to cause them to tear it
[1:14:04] to be torn apart. And he says, you know,
[1:14:06] and the reason that people falling for
[1:14:08] it, he says, and he said, you preachers
[1:14:10] that are not preaching the gospel, if
[1:14:13] you won't feed them right food, amen,
[1:14:15] they're hungry people. He said they'll
[1:14:18] eat out of a garbage can or they'll eat
[1:14:21] garbage basically. Hello. So, he was
[1:14:24] speaking on that and he was saying he
[1:14:26] makes the statement. Amen. He made a
[1:14:28] statement and I didn't realize I might
[1:14:30] go there, but Amen. I'm going to go
[1:14:32] ahead and pull it up if I can. Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; [clears throat and cough]
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He says, he makes a statement in it. He
[1:14:41] says, "Listen, brother." He says,
[1:14:42] "You're never saved by any sign. You're
[1:14:45] not saved by any sensation. You are
[1:14:48] saved when you meet God's conditions of
[1:14:50] his word." Amen. And nothing else, he
[1:14:54] said, "Are you saved by?" That's right.
[1:14:56] God's word has made a way. You're not
[1:15:00] saved because you feel like you're
[1:15:02] saved. I'm not saved because I feel like
[1:15:04] I'm saved because a lot of times I don't
[1:15:06] feel that way. I'm saved because God
[1:15:08] gave a promise and I met God's promise
[1:15:11] and upon God's holy word, I can defeat
[1:15:14] Satan seven days in a week and as many
[1:15:16] nights because the word is God's word.
[1:15:20] Amen. So, how many believe this morning
[1:15:23] there's nothing as powerful? There's
[1:15:25] nothing that'll ever substitute amen
[1:15:28] your strength AND YOUR FAITH IN GOD'S
[1:15:31] WORD. AMEN. To overcome the enemy with
[1:15:34] than simply believing the word of God.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Simply believing his word. Amen. Praise
[1:15:42] the Lord. So this morning, I want to
[1:15:44] begin to think about this and I really
[1:15:46] want to tie about three different
[1:15:48] message or thoughts together this
[1:15:49] morning if I can. Amen. So first of all,
[1:15:52] WE REALIZE THAT GOD KEEPS HIS WORD.
[1:15:55] AMEN. And God's thoughts, AMEN. AND OUR
[1:15:59] thoughts are so different.
[1:16:04] I BELIEVE PAUL EXPRESSED IT PRETTY GOOD
[1:16:06] IN ROMANS. I BELIEVE it was when he said
[1:16:08] that the carnal mind is emnity against
[1:16:10] Christ. It's not subject to God. Neither
[1:16:13] can be. In other words, Amen. Your your
[1:16:17] natural carnal thought. AMEN. IT'S GOING
[1:16:19] TO GO the wrong direction.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; SO, WE NEED GOD'S THOUGHTS. THAT'S WHAT
[1:16:24] WE WANT to try to share. AMEN. IS GOD'S
[1:16:27] THOUGHTS, NOT OUR THOUGHTS.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I believe one place he said Israel
[1:16:34] erred BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW GOD'S
[1:16:37] WAYS. They didn't, you know, how many
[1:16:40] believes if you're ever going to
[1:16:41] understand somebody, it's important that
[1:16:43] you understand the way that he thinks,
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; the way that God thinks. Otherwise,
[1:16:50] you're going to miss the mark. Amen.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. how how important
[1:16:57] how important it is this morning. Amen.
[1:17:01] To have the Holy Spirit. Amen. Brother
[1:17:04] Bam TALKED ABOUT IT'S SO NECESSARY to
[1:17:06] have the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:09] Amen. Because uh you know, and before I
[1:17:12] say that, remember this is talking about
[1:17:13] the mind of God. Now, how many believe
[1:17:15] that we should have the mind of God?
[1:17:18] Because Paul said we should have the
[1:17:20] mind of God. We should be able to think
[1:17:22] the way that God thinks. Amen. Amen. And
[1:17:25] the only way that we can really do that
[1:17:27] is by the new birth.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That by the BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:17:32] Spirit in our hearts.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; It's the only way you're going to BE
[1:17:36] ABLE TO THINK THE WAY THAT GOD THINKS.
[1:17:39] And it's a higher thought, man. It's so
[1:17:42] much higher.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? When when you think that it's
[1:17:47] absolutely impossible,
[1:17:50] can't be done. Well, guess what? That
[1:17:53] might be what you think as A NATURAL
[1:17:54] MAN, BUT God said, "IF THOU CAN'T
[1:17:57] BELIEVE, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:18:01] NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO THEM THAT
[1:18:03] BELIEVE."
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SEES THAT THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER
[1:18:07] THOUGHT THERE?
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:11] There's many questions in this life.
[1:18:14] Many questions that there is. AND YOU
[1:18:16] KNOW, I have a I HAVE A QUESTION to kind
[1:18:18] of ask you all this morning. And I think
[1:18:20] you might have heard this phrase before.
[1:18:23] AMEN. BUT HOW do you get the correct
[1:18:26] answer to something?
[1:18:29] How do you get the correct answer to
[1:18:31] something?
[1:18:33] Amen.
[1:18:36] Pretty good. Anybody got the answer?
[1:18:41] Well, my answer is by asking the right
[1:18:44] question.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; By asking the right question.
[1:18:51] Because if you don't ask the right
[1:18:52] question, you won't get the right
[1:18:53] answer.
[1:18:55] Now, how many knows we're going to start
[1:18:57] here with Eve.
[1:19:00] God had told her that the day that you
[1:19:03] eat thereof, that day you shall die.
[1:19:08] And what did THE DEVIL SAY? YAY. GOD HAD
[1:19:10] SAID, but
[1:19:13] Amen. SHE WHAT? SHE QUESTIONED. BUT said
[1:19:17] she questioned
[1:19:19] whether God would keep his word.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; See, the devil gave her a different
[1:19:27] answer, didn't he? HE GAVE HER THE wrong
[1:19:30] answer.
[1:19:33] Give her the wrong ANSWER AND SHE NEEDED
[1:19:36] TO GO BACK TO THE RIGHT QUESTION.
[1:19:39] IF SHE'D HAVE STAYED WITH THE RIGHT
[1:19:41] QUESTION, AMEN. SHE'D HAVE BEEN ALL
[1:19:44] RIGHT.
[1:19:46] BUT SHE BEGAN TO YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD
[1:19:48] HAVE SAID LOOK AND SHE EVEN MENTIONED
[1:19:50] IT. GOD HAS SAID HOW MANY KNOW THAT'S
[1:19:53] WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH. AMEN.
[1:19:56] THAT IS GOD HAS SAID THIS. WHAT DID GOD
[1:20:00] SAY? HE SAID THAT THOU SHALT SURELY DIE.
[1:20:03] THOU SHALT SURELY DIE IS THE CORRECT
[1:20:06] ANSWER.
[1:20:09] NOT YOU'RE NOT SURELY. GOD KNOWS THAT
[1:20:12] YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE HIM, KNOWING
[1:20:13] GOOD AND EVIL. THOU SHALT NOT SURELY
[1:20:17] DIE.
[1:20:20] Gave her the wrong answer.
[1:20:22] You know, IT KIND OF REMINDED ME OF THE
[1:20:24] HOUR THAT YOU AND I ARE living in.
[1:20:29] The devil IS GIVING THEM BOTH THE WRONG
[1:20:31] QUESTION AND THE WRONG ANSWER.
[1:20:35] WHAT IS THE QUESTION OUT THERE NOWADAYS?
[1:20:38] NOWADAYS THE QUESTION IS can a man have
[1:20:41] a baby
[1:20:46] that's first of all it's a wrong
[1:20:48] question
[1:20:49] you know AND IT'S GOT A WRONG ANSWER can
[1:20:52] you imagine come on people I don't care
[1:20:55] if our politicians hear this this
[1:20:56] morning or not BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE UP
[1:20:59] THERE THAT'LL SAY WHY SURE
[1:21:03] absolutely light.
[1:21:09] And you know, it's the most deceiving,
[1:21:11] conniving question and answer I've ever
[1:21:13] heard. Amen.
[1:21:17] Because the only way THAT A MAN COULD,
[1:21:21] AND that's the way that they think
[1:21:23] because they've accepted the devil's
[1:21:25] answer, the only WAY THAT A SO TO SPEAK
[1:21:27] MAN COULD HAVE A baby is if a woman
[1:21:31] CHOOSES TO BE IDENTIFIED AS A MAN.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; She could have a baby, couldn't she?
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; YEAH, SURE. BECAUSE SHE I SAID
[1:21:46] IDENTIFIES I DIDN'T SAY SHE WAS I SAID
[1:21:49] SHE IDENTIFIES AS A MAN. SO THEY GO UP
[1:21:52] THERE AND OUR POLITICIANS ASK THEM HEY
[1:21:54] CAN A MAN HAVE A BABY and they'll say
[1:21:56] yeah and I'm LIKE MIGRATION LET'S GO
[1:21:58] BACK TO THE RIGHT QUESTION.
[1:22:01] Let me TELL YOU WHAT THE RIGHT QUESTION
[1:22:03] IS. I LIKE THE QUESTION THEY'LL ASK HIM.
[1:22:05] HOW MANY GENDERS ARE THERE? [screaming]
[1:22:09] YEAH. TALK TO ME. GIVE ME THE RIGHT
[1:22:11] QUESTION AND WE'LL GET THE RIGHT
[1:22:13] QUESTION. WHY? BECAUSE LET EVERY MAN'S
[1:22:15] WORD BE [screaming] A LIE AND MIND THE
[1:22:17] TRUTH. AMEN. IN THE BEGINNING, HE MADE
[1:22:19] MALE AND HE MADE FEMALE. HE MADE MAN AND
[1:22:22] HE WILL MADE A WOMAN. [applause]
[1:22:26] That's the right answer. And there IS NO
[1:22:29] OTHER ANSWER. EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE
[1:22:31] DEVIL'S ANSWER. AMEN. AND IT BRINGS
[1:22:33] CONFUSION
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; AND DEATH
[1:22:39] BECAUSE IT'S A LIE. HOW MANY KNOW THAT'S
[1:22:41] A LIE TO THINK A MAN CAN DO IT?
[1:22:45] AMEN. Man can do it. I want to see this.
[1:22:50] Never going to happen from what I
[1:22:52] understand. If you ever did, you sisters
[1:22:54] thought you'd never want to have a
[1:22:55] second one.
[1:22:57] Pretty bad stuff.
[1:23:00] But we know better than that. Ain't that
[1:23:01] right? But that's an example, isn't that
[1:23:03] a good example of HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT
[1:23:05] GOD KEEPS HIS WORD this morning? OH MY.
[1:23:08] THAT'S THAT'S JUST MY WHOLE MESSAGE
[1:23:10] right there. GOD DOES WHAT HE SAYS HE'S
[1:23:14] GOING TO DO. IF YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN
[1:23:16] GOD, GOD WILL KEEP HIS WORD.
[1:23:20] [applause]
[1:23:21] THE THREE HEBREW CHILDREN, THEY PUT
[1:23:22] THEIR TRUST IN GOD. BLESSED HE IS HE
[1:23:25] THAT PUTTETH HIS TRUST AND FAITH IN
[1:23:27] ALMIGHTY GOD CUZ HE COMES ON THE SCENE.
[1:23:30] HE CAN'T FAIL.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; BUT BAM SAYS, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T ALWAYS
[1:23:35] KEEP OUR WORD. WE NEED TO KEEP OUR WORD
[1:23:37] IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. BUT WE'RE HUMANS.
[1:23:39] WE'RE FALLIBLE. YOU MIGHT BE DEAD BEFORE
[1:23:41] YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PROMISE TOMORROW.
[1:23:45] AMEN. SO SOMETIME WE CAN'T. BUT GOD
[1:23:47] [screaming] HAS TO KEEP HIS WORD. HE
[1:23:48] DOES KEEP HIS WORD.
[1:23:51] IT CANNOT COME BACK FOR IT. IT'S GOING
[1:23:53] TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE SAID.
[1:23:56] So much so, AMEN, THAT WHENEVER THE
[1:23:59] PHARISEES WANTED THEM TO SHUT UP, SHUT
[1:24:01] UP AND NOT HALLELUJAH AND PRAISE GOD,
[1:24:03] HOSANA TO HIM THAT COMETH ON, HE SAID,
[1:24:05] YOU KNOW, HE SAYS, MAN, IF THEY SHUT UP,
[1:24:06] [screaming] THE ROCKS WILL IMMEDIATELY
[1:24:08] CRY OUT CUZ MY WORD WILL NOT COME BACK
[1:24:11] VOID.
[1:24:15] AMEN.
[1:24:17] Isn't that where our hope is, our
[1:24:19] confidence is this morning?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; That God keeps his word.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] Praise be to God. Let me go back on this
[1:24:29] a little bit. Talking about how many
[1:24:32] believes that we've got the we've got
[1:24:34] the answer to the devil's question.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] The right question
[1:24:41] that people in our generation need to be
[1:24:43] asking
[1:24:45] is ONE OF THEM IS WHERE DID WE COME
[1:24:48] FROM?
[1:24:50] BECAUSE THEY'RE believing that we CAME
[1:24:51] FROM A TADPOLE AND EVOLVED. NO, THAT'S
[1:24:54] NOT WHERE WE COME FROM.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. How many believes IN THE
[1:24:58] BEGINNING, GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND
[1:25:01] THE EARTH?
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE WE COME FROM.
[1:25:04] IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW WHERE WE
[1:25:07] COME FROM. EVENING LIKE TABERNACLE,
[1:25:09] [screaming]
[1:25:10] YOU'RE NOT A HYBRID. YOU'RE NOT A MIX
[1:25:12] BETWEEN A A HORSE AND A JACKASS OR A A
[1:25:14] DONKEY, I GUESS IT IS. ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[1:25:17] WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF MULES.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; NO, WE KNOW WHO WE ARE. [screaming] WE
[1:25:21] KNOW WHERE WE COME FROM. WE KNOW WHAT
[1:25:23] OUR PURPOSE IS HERE. THOSE ARE THE MOST
[1:25:25] IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN ASK.
[1:25:27] AMEN. ALMIGHTY GOD, DOES GOD KEEP HIS
[1:25:30] WORD? YES, HE DOES.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE THAT BROUGHT US HERE. AS
[1:25:34] BROTHER BENAM SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO
[1:25:35] IMPORTANT WE IT WOULD PAY US. AMEN. IF
[1:25:39] WE SAT DOWN AND [screaming] ASK WHERE WE
[1:25:40] COME FROM, WHO BROUGHT US HERE?
[1:25:46] WHO BROUGHT US HERE? AND THE SECONDLY IS
[1:25:48] WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR?
[1:25:52] HOW MANY BELIEVES EVERY ONE OF YOU
[1:25:53] SITTING THERE? NO, WE CAN'T [screaming]
[1:25:54] ALL BE PREACHERS. WE ALL CAN'T BE THE
[1:25:56] PREACHER. BUT YOU'VE GOT A MINISTRY. YOU
[1:25:59] GOT SOMETHING THAT GOD'S GOT YOU TO DO.
[1:26:02] WE ALL DO ALL WANT TO FIND [screaming]
[1:26:03] THAT PLACE AND DO WHAT GOD WANTS US TO
[1:26:05] DO AND BE HAPPY RIGHT THERE. I DON'T
[1:26:08] CARE WHAT it is.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] It's a terrible thing
[1:26:22] to question God's word.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing. Eve did it.
[1:26:31] A lot of people down through time did
[1:26:32] it.
[1:26:34] Samson did it.
[1:26:38] Huh?
[1:26:41] You know how brother Bam said that
[1:26:44] told the story of these carriage
[1:26:45] drivers. Is that right?
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; And they could go around this mountain,
[1:26:50] this very cliffy mountain. And this one
[1:26:53] said, "Man, I can go at full gallop and
[1:26:55] I can come within an inch of the edge."
[1:27:02] Wow. Really? Full gallop them four
[1:27:05] horses just to get it. The other one
[1:27:08] said, "Well, I can't quite do that. I
[1:27:10] stay about five or six inches away from
[1:27:12] the edge, but I can do almost as good."
[1:27:15] Ain't that right?
[1:27:17] Oh, wow. That's pretty cool. The other
[1:27:20] one said, "You know, I might be able to
[1:27:21] do that, but I hug inside just as hard
[1:27:24] as I can."
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "You're hired. I want you."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes THAT'S THE WAY
[1:27:33] WE ought to be with our lives? That's
[1:27:35] how you OUGHT TO BE WITH YOUR PHONES,
[1:27:36] WITH YOUR INTERNET. Just stay as far
[1:27:38] away from that edge as you possibly can.
[1:27:42] THAT'S RIGHT. STAY CLOSE TO THE HOLY
[1:27:44] SPIRIT. Stay close to God.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOLLOW THE HOLY SPIRIT. WE NEED IT
[1:27:49] MORE THAN EVER. AMEN.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; SAMSON, HE CAME OUT CLOSE TO THE EDGE.
[1:27:54] HE JUST WALLOWED RIGHT THERE ON THE
[1:27:56] EDGE.
[1:27:58] Remember all THE TIME SHE'D ASK HIM NOW,
[1:28:00] "WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?
[1:28:02] WHAT YOU AND HE GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER
[1:28:03] AND CLOSER TILL ONE TIME HE SAYS YOU
[1:28:06] KNOW IT ISN'T really going to matter if
[1:28:07] I really tell her
[1:28:10] cuz if he wouldn't have questioned he'd
[1:28:12] realize what had happened he's going to
[1:28:13] get his eyes gouged out and he's going
[1:28:14] to become a slave and he'll going to
[1:28:16] have no power he's not going to be no
[1:28:18] hero no more
[1:28:21] huh
[1:28:22] that's right if you thought about it and
[1:28:24] he questioned how maybe God won't or
[1:28:26] whatever but what did God do THAT'S
[1:28:28] RIGHT HE LOST HIS POWER WHY BECAUSE HE
[1:28:31] GOT OUT FROM BEHIND THE PROTECTION OF
[1:28:32] THE WORD.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:37] God help us
[1:28:40] to believe everything God has said.
[1:28:44] God keeps his word.
[1:28:47] Amen. Don't question it. Praise the
[1:28:50] Lord.
[1:28:52] Eve found out, didn't she?
[1:28:55] Adam found out.
[1:28:58] Amen. when they thought that God
[1:29:00] wouldn't keep his word.
[1:29:04] Brother Bram said,
[1:29:09] I don't think I quote printed it out,
[1:29:13] but he says, "A minister comes up here
[1:29:16] and begins to preach the word." First of
[1:29:18] all, let me say this. How many believes
[1:29:20] that us preachers, we got to be up here
[1:29:23] for the right reason?
[1:29:26] Brother B said, "No selfish motive will
[1:29:28] work. If we're up here to impress you or
[1:29:32] to be a somebody or we're here for money
[1:29:35] or popularity, if you're here for the
[1:29:38] wrong reason, it will not be blessed.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; God won't bless it." No, you got to be
[1:29:45] here for the right reason. Doing it for
[1:29:46] the right reason. He was saying, you
[1:29:49] know, it might come into that preacher's
[1:29:51] mind. Well, now, you know, there's a
[1:29:52] heavy tithe pay or whatever. So, you
[1:29:54] know, he might be offended and quit if I
[1:29:56] preach this. I mean, know, sure. Sure.
[1:30:00] Every one of us, even us preachers got
[1:30:02] to be up here and we got to fight off
[1:30:04] that carnal thought. We got to get rid
[1:30:07] of our carnal mind and let the Holy
[1:30:09] Spirit speak.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Preach the word. LET THE CHIPS FALL
[1:30:12] where they may.
[1:30:14] I hope I WAS THINKING LAST WEEK, I HOPE,
[1:30:17] AMEN. THAT GOD CAN USE ME IN SUCH A WAY.
[1:30:19] AMEN. THAT I'LL SPEAK PAST YOUR FLESH.
[1:30:21] AMEN. PEACE. SPEAK PAST YOUR SPIRIT.
[1:30:24] AMEN. AND SPEAK ALL [screaming] THE WAY
[1:30:26] TO YOUR SOUL.
[1:30:30] Cuz I guarantee you, AMEN. WE SAY THAT
[1:30:33] WE SAY THAT WORD OF GOD KEEPS HIS WORD
[1:30:35] ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION.
[1:30:38] HIS WORD IS YAY. [screaming]
[1:30:40] HIS WORD IS TRUTH. HOW MANY BELIEVES, I
[1:30:43] AM THE WAY. I AM THE TRUTH. I AM THE
[1:30:45] LIFE IS WHAT JESUS SAID.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT SPEAKS TO OUR SOULS. WHEN WE
[1:30:50] SAY WE'RE GETTING READY FOR A
[1:30:52] TRANSLATION, WE SAY, "AMEN, BROTHER.
[1:30:55] WE'RE LETTING [screaming] GOD WORK ON
[1:30:56] US." AMEN. THOUGH TRIALS MAY COME. AMEN.
[1:30:58] THOUGH PRESSURE MAY COME. AMEN. LIKE A
[1:31:01] AMEN. LIKE THE EIFFEL TOWER UP ON THE
[1:31:03] TOP OF AMEN. A SUGAR CUBES CRUSHING US
[1:31:05] DOWN.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:11] WOO!
[1:31:13] GLORY. [screaming]
[1:31:15] IT AIN'T GOING TO CRUSH US. NO. IT'LL
[1:31:18] CRUSH THE OLD MAN OUT. IT'LL CAUSE YOU
[1:31:20] TO BE THE DEAD, BUT BRING FORTH PURE
[1:31:23] GOLD. IT'LL P BRING FORTH REAL DIAMOND.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; IT'LL BRING FORTH WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO
[1:31:28] BRING FORTH.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; How many believes we just can't do
[1:31:36] anything without Christ? And he gets all
[1:31:39] the glory.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. I WITHOUT ME, JESUS SAID,
[1:31:44] YOU CAN DO NOTHING.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITHIN
[1:31:49] OURSELVES, WE GET IN TROUBLE. EVE
[1:31:52] THOUGHT SHE'D HAVE MORE REVELATION, MORE
[1:31:54] LIGHT.
[1:31:56] When you question God, let me say this.
[1:32:00] You think that you know more about it
[1:32:02] than God does.
[1:32:07] God help us take our thoughts away.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Well, God's word says this, but I do
[1:32:13] this or that or the other. Well, hey,
[1:32:15] you're thinking that you know more about
[1:32:16] it than God.
[1:32:19] Amen.
[1:32:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:25] Some questions. I'm going to go over
[1:32:26] this for just a little bit.
[1:32:29] Questions.
[1:32:31] Amen. About where we come from. what our
[1:32:35] purpose is here to fulfill his plan. How
[1:32:39] many be that's important?
[1:32:42] That's so important to understand what
[1:32:43] we're here for.
[1:32:51] When I was younger out in the world,
[1:32:53] didn't know who I was, didn't know what
[1:32:55] I belonged to,
[1:32:58] Irvin and Marson remember me a little
[1:32:59] bit back then. That's right. Long hair.
[1:33:03] I don't know if hippie,
[1:33:06] rock and roll,
[1:33:09] all of that mess. Thought maybe that's
[1:33:11] what I was. But I thank God one day I
[1:33:14] realized that's not what I am. THAT'S
[1:33:17] NOT [screaming] WHO I AM. [applause]
[1:33:20] There's something IN HERE
[1:33:23] TELLING ME I'M SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
[1:33:26] I'M NOT JUST LOST. I'M NOT JUST MAN,
[1:33:28] WHAT IS RIGHT? DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. NO.
[1:33:32] I KNEW THERE'S a leader somewhere.
[1:33:34] THERE'S A GUIDE SOMEWHERE.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VOID IN HERE THAT I WANT
[1:33:38] FILLED.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A HUNGER AND A THIRST THAT GOD
[1:33:42] PUT IN THERE.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS THAT THAT'S THE GRACE OF
[1:33:46] ALMIGHTY GOD? CUZ EVEN BROTHER BAM SAYS,
[1:33:48] "AIN'T NOBODY EVER SEEKS GOD. IT'S
[1:33:50] ALWAYS GOD SEEKING MAN." SO IF YOU HAVE
[1:33:52] A DESIRE FOR GOD, IF YOU HAVE A THIRST
[1:33:55] FOR GOD, YOU THANK GOD FOR THAT LITTLE
[1:33:57] THIRST.
[1:33:59] If you're not content with the world,
[1:34:01] you're not content with how you are.
[1:34:03] You're not content with the walk that
[1:34:04] you have with Christ right now and you
[1:34:06] say, "I want a deeper walk. I want a
[1:34:08] closer walk." Cuz brother Bam said an
[1:34:10] 80-year-old lady in a man, amen, THEIR
[1:34:12] HEART'S DESIRE WAS A CLOSER WALK WITH
[1:34:14] GOD. HOW MANY IS WITH ME THIS MORNING?
[1:34:16] THAT'S WHAT WE DESIRE ABOVE [screaming]
[1:34:18] EVERYTHING IS A CLOSER WALK WITH GOD.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. UNTIL ONE DAY, BROTHER BRAD. AMEN.
[1:34:24] WE'RE NOT JUST BE HAVE A CLOSE WALK
[1:34:25] HERE. AMEN. BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TO WALK
[1:34:28] WITH HIM SIDE BY SIDE. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:34:30] STAND BY HIS SIDE. WE'RE GOING TO BE
[1:34:33] WITH HIM. We're going to be like him.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; That is our heart's desire. That is our
[1:34:39] passion is to be more like him. Oh, TO
[1:34:42] BE LIKE HIM. OH, TO BE LIKE HIM. AMEN.
[1:34:48] [clears throat]
[1:34:49] AMEN. Praise the Lord. The purpose of
[1:34:53] being here.
[1:34:56] Think about of all of our liberals, all
[1:34:58] of our leftists. Think about a lot of
[1:34:59] the right. Think about a lot of the
[1:35:01] Republicans. Think about all the world
[1:35:03] that doesn't really know what they're
[1:35:05] here for.
[1:35:09] They don't know who they are. They don't
[1:35:11] know what they are.
[1:35:14] Do they really think that adding another
[1:35:16] tattoo is going to give them a
[1:35:17] revelation of who they are? Another
[1:35:20] earring, another nose ring,
[1:35:23] another wickedness, another this, that,
[1:35:25] or the other. No, they'll never find it.
[1:35:27] They'll never find that. Brother Bam
[1:35:29] says that type of life, sin will never
[1:35:33] quench that thirst that's down in there.
[1:35:36] Cuz God I Hello. How many knows he put a
[1:35:39] void in everybody's heart?
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; He put a void in there.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It needs to be filled. a incomp
[1:35:48] completion.
[1:35:50] He left us incomplete.
[1:35:53] HE BROUGHT US TO A PLACE THERE WHERE WE
[1:35:55] WOULD BE INCOMPLETE SO WE WOULD DESIRE
[1:35:58] COMPLETENESS.
[1:36:00] WE WOULD DESIRE TO BE FILLED. A
[1:36:03] DISSATISFACTION SO YOU WOULD DESIRE A
[1:36:06] SATISFACTION SO HE COULD SATISFY YOU. SO
[1:36:10] HE COULD fulfill you.
[1:36:13] bring fulfillment
[1:36:15] in understanding who you are, what you
[1:36:19] come from, and where you're going. Amen.
[1:36:24] Where you are going. Then I will have
[1:36:27] some more questions. Amen. A few other
[1:36:30] questions that we really need to be
[1:36:31] asking ourselves. Asked the right
[1:36:34] question, get the right answer.
[1:36:39] There's a lot of people down through the
[1:36:41] Bible that question
[1:36:44] question God.
[1:36:46] Moses even,
[1:36:48] man, I can't speak. I ain't got no
[1:36:51] language. How am I going to go down
[1:36:53] there and do this? I'm insufficient.
[1:36:57] Amen. Didn't brother Brand preach on
[1:36:59] that on and the greatest battle ever
[1:37:01] fought? WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE
[1:37:03] INSUFFICIENT.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T DO IT. WE'RE INCAPABLE. BUT
[1:37:08] SAYS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GOD USES IF YOU
[1:37:11] RECOGNIZE, [screaming] YEAH, THAT'S YOU.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS. THAT'S YOUR WAYS.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; But think MY THOUGHTS.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS, "BEGIN TO THINK LIKE ME.
[1:37:25] DIDN'T I MAKE THE MOUTH? DIDN'T I MAKE
[1:37:27] THE VOCAL CORDS? I MADE IT. MOSES, HAVE
[1:37:31] YOUR CONFIDENCE IN ME. IF I TELL YOU TO
[1:37:33] GO, I'M NOT GOING TO SEND YOU DOWN THERE
[1:37:36] BY YOURSELF. I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And God did.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe someday we'll get to hit the
[1:37:50] replay of when he got went into Pharaoh
[1:37:52] to tell him. I don't know. Didn't he
[1:37:55] have like a stuttering or something?
[1:37:58] Impedment.
[1:38:01] Pharaoh.
[1:38:03] you you you you going to going to have
[1:38:06] to let let let him let him go.
[1:38:09] Maybe not. Maybe he had perfectly clear
[1:38:11] talk. I don't know. But I'm here to tell
[1:38:13] you, God will use the foolish things of
[1:38:15] the world to confound the wise. He'll
[1:38:18] take the stupid things of what man
[1:38:19] thinks and he'll bring Pharaohs to their
[1:38:21] knees.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:25] That's right. Because it's the ability
[1:38:26] that God gives. HOW MANY GLAD FOR THE
[1:38:29] ABILITY THAT GOD GIVES?
[1:38:33] I REJOICE THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:38:35] BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID IF HE HAS BEGUN A
[1:38:38] WORK in you, a good work in you.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to finish it.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; NO, IT'S NOT UP TO YOU TO FINISH IT.
[1:38:47] HE'S GOING TO finish it.
[1:38:50] [screaming]
[1:38:51] HOW MANY GLAD FOR THAT? HE STARTED A
[1:38:53] WORK IN ME AND HIS WORD. HE KEEPS HIS
[1:38:56] WORD. HE'S GOING TO FINISH THIS THING.
[1:38:59] [applause]
[1:39:00] HE'S GOING TO FINISH IT. HE BROUGHT US
[1:39:02] SAFE THIS FAR, BROTHER BRAD. AND HE'S
[1:39:04] GOING TO LEAD US ALL THE WAY. EVENING
[1:39:06] NIGHT TIME. HE'S GOING TO LEAD US ALL
[1:39:09] [screaming] THE WAY.
[1:39:11] [applause]
[1:39:11] IT'S HIS WORK. IT'S HIS PROMISE. AND I'M
[1:39:15] RELYING ON IT. I'M COUNTING ON IT,
[1:39:17] BROTHER DANNY. [applause]
[1:39:19] WOO. [screaming]
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:25] [sighs and gasps]
[1:39:29] If id have had more time, we'd have had
[1:39:32] a lot more. But listen,
[1:39:35] you got a good work. There's so many
[1:39:36] promise, isn't it? All that the father
[1:39:38] hath given me will come to me and I
[1:39:42] won't lose a one. THAT'S HIS WORD.
[1:39:46] NO MAN CAN PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND.
[1:39:48] HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU'RE IN THE HANDS OF
[1:39:49] GOD? AND THERE IS NO HEIGHT, NO DEPTH,
[1:39:52] NO DEVIL, NO SPIRIT. NOTHING WILL
[1:39:55] SEPARATE YOU FROM THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:39:57] THAT'S HIS WORD.
[1:40:00] Whom he predestinated
[1:40:03] don't to those who he forneew. He
[1:40:05] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:40:08] image of his son whom he has
[1:40:11] justified. He has also sanctified who he
[1:40:13] has sanctified. He's already glorified.
[1:40:20] M
[1:40:21] yum yum.
[1:40:23] Brother Bram said the Pentecostals used
[1:40:25] to do that. They actually lift their to
[1:40:26] lick their lip.
[1:40:29] That's good.
[1:40:33] You know what's good, brother Brad? I'll
[1:40:35] tell you what's good about it. Our
[1:40:37] prophet told us that what that meant
[1:40:40] whom he has justified,
[1:40:43] he has already glorified.
[1:40:46] Brother Glenn, that means that you
[1:40:49] already have a glorified body.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many glad for that?
[1:40:55] WE'VE ALREADY GOT A [screaming]
[1:40:56] GLORIFIED BODY WAITING FOR US.
[1:41:01] HOW THAT NOT A THRILL EVENING LIKE
[1:41:02] TABERNACLE? HOW THAT THRILLS US THIS
[1:41:04] MORNING? DON'T THAT THRILL DOWN IN YOUR
[1:41:07] SOUL. KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A THEOPHONY
[1:41:09] WAITING AND A THEOPHONY I HEAR IT
[1:41:12] [screaming] CALLING ME.
[1:41:15] MY THEOPHONY I HEAR IT CALLING ME. IT'S
[1:41:18] CALLING. Come up. A LITTLE HIGHER. COME
[1:41:20] UP. EVENING LIKE TABERNACLE. A LITTLE
[1:41:23] HIGHER. MORE THAN WE WERE LAST WEEK.
[1:41:26] MORE THAN WE WERE LAST MONTH. COME ON
[1:41:28] [screaming] PEOPLE. YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE
[1:41:30] HIGHER. YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP HIGHER.
[1:41:33] WE CAN'T STAY ON THE SAME PLATEAU.
[1:41:35] THOMAS [screaming] CAN'T STAY IN THE
[1:41:37] SAME PLACE. [sighs]
[1:41:40] [panting]
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:44] while ago I said told you I felt like my
[1:41:47] ministry was going to change a little.
[1:41:49] Not trying to copy the prophet but just
[1:41:52] to realize that hey there should be a
[1:41:54] little progress here.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Don't you reckon
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; should be some progress with us. And if
[1:42:00] it ought to be with our pastor then it
[1:42:02] ought to be with each one of us.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; He ought to be able to say you know
[1:42:06] there's going to be a little change in
[1:42:07] my life. Amen. We're going to come UP A
[1:42:09] LITTLE HIGHER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
[1:42:11] LIKE WE USED TO BE.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, it's going to BECOME MORE
[1:42:17] IMPORTANT TO ME. GOD'S GOING TO BECOME
[1:42:19] MORE IMPORTANT TO ME.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MORE IMPORTANT TO HEAR THE WORD OF
[1:42:23] GOD, TO PLAY A TAPE THAN TO SCROLL ON
[1:42:25] YOUTUBE,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE SO MUCH TIME ON THOSE THINGS,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; on our prayer bones.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:37] [sighs]
[1:42:39] Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Donna, didn't you not get that clock
[1:42:51] turned back? Cuz I've got 10 till 1.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; 10 till 1.
[1:43:01] [laughter]
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Man, you have almost got everybody out
[1:43:04] of here early today, baby.
[1:43:08] [laughter]
[1:43:10] Uh,
[1:43:12] and the Holy Spirit picked that up,
[1:43:14] right? Correct the air there. So, it's
[1:43:17] actually uh
[1:43:19] 11:52.
[1:43:21] Hey, that's all right. We got plenty of
[1:43:23] time, don't we?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's That's what's
[1:43:27] important to us is God's word.
[1:43:31] How many believes that? Oh, I just love
[1:43:34] these Bible stories. Don't you? But
[1:43:36] listen, there was another one. GOT IN A
[1:43:39] WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE BECAUSE OF HIS OWN
[1:43:42] CARNAL THOUGHTS. And that was Kora and
[1:43:45] Nathan.
[1:43:47] Huh? CORA AND DAYATHAN THOUGHT, "MOSES,
[1:43:50] YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY HOLY ONE HERE. THESE
[1:43:52] WERE NO DOUBT RENOWNED MEN, MEN OF
[1:43:54] RENOWN. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT FOLLOWED
[1:43:57] DAYAN AND KORA. Is that right? YOU'RE
[1:44:00] NOT THE ONLY HOLY MAN HERE." And you
[1:44:03] know what they were really wanting is
[1:44:06] power.
[1:44:08] They want recognition,
[1:44:10] popularity, and power. You know,
[1:44:14] GOD USES US, TOO. Be careful what you
[1:44:17] think. God wasn't happy with their
[1:44:20] thoughts, now was he? They thought they
[1:44:23] knew more about it than what God thought
[1:44:26] about it. HOW MANY KNOW GOD WOULD HAVE
[1:44:28] CALLED HIM IF THEM IF THEY WANTED TO?
[1:44:31] Later on, THERE WAS A DISTRIBUTION of
[1:44:34] the responsibilities handed down later
[1:44:36] on, but not the way that them guys
[1:44:39] thought, the way that they wanted to do
[1:44:40] it. Amen.
[1:44:43] God was so displeased with it until he
[1:44:45] opened up the earth and swallowed them
[1:44:47] up because of the wrong thoughts that
[1:44:49] they had and the question that they had
[1:44:51] to God's answer. How many of these Moses
[1:44:53] was God's answers to delivering the
[1:44:55] delivering of the Israelites? I I like
[1:44:59] this CUZ GOD SAID, "I HAVE COME DOWN TO
[1:45:02] DELIVER MY PEOPLE AND I'M SENDING YOU,
[1:45:05] MOSES." HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT GOD DOES
[1:45:07] THINGS AND HE DOES IT THROUGH YOU? HE
[1:45:10] DOES IT THROUGH HIS PEOPLE.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; But you've got TO BE YIELDED. YOU'VE GOT
[1:45:15] TO BE SURRENDERED TO ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:45:25] Amen.
[1:45:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:33] Surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:45:38] Lord, help us. I believe we're getting
[1:45:40] closer and closer
[1:45:44] and that we need to be dead and dead to
[1:45:48] oursel that the Holy Spirit will have a
[1:45:51] greater and greater
[1:45:55] preeminence in each one of our lives.
[1:46:00] Not just just here in this last little
[1:46:02] bit. There are things I've been praying
[1:46:04] for and I find that if you will give
[1:46:07] time, give God a few weeks, give him a
[1:46:09] month, give him time. Don't be in such a
[1:46:12] hurry. I ain't no hurry. Never was
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; but God will answer.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe God answers?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; But it has to be God.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I BELIEVE THAT IS GOD IN YOU
[1:46:29] FULFILLING HIS PURPOSE, HIS WILL.
[1:46:37] I'm going to ask you another question.
[1:46:39] Next question is how do we overcome?
[1:46:44] How can we overcome?
[1:46:48] Brother Brad Wednesday brought it out
[1:46:49] how that God allows afflictions. He
[1:46:52] allows hard things to come our way.
[1:46:56] And this morning, I know I've preached
[1:46:59] on this many times, but I want to I feel
[1:47:01] like I have just a little bit more light
[1:47:02] on it. So, I want to touch on it a
[1:47:05] little bit.
[1:47:07] HOW HOW DO WE OVERCOME TRIALS? HOW WE
[1:47:11] OVERCOME TESTS, HARDSHIPS, things that
[1:47:14] are really, really
[1:47:17] get us to where we can't get over it. We
[1:47:19] can't get under it. You can't get around
[1:47:20] it.
[1:47:24] What is God's word on it? God's word on
[1:47:27] it is it this. But whatsoever is born of
[1:47:30] God overcometh the world. And this is
[1:47:33] the victory that overcometh the world,
[1:47:36] even our faith. Who is he that
[1:47:39] overcomemeth the world? But he that
[1:47:40] believeth that Jesus is the son of God.
[1:47:45] Now we normally we just think, WELL,
[1:47:47] IT'S YOUR FAITH THAT OVERCOMES. BUT YOUR
[1:47:49] FAITH HAS TO BE IN SOMETHING.
[1:47:52] YOU HAVE TO FA HAVE [laughter] FAITH IN
[1:47:54] SOMETHING
[1:47:56] AND THAT HAS TO BE IN WHAT? GOD.
[1:48:00] It's your faith IN JESUS CHRIST. IT'S
[1:48:03] YOUR FAITH IN THE WORD.
[1:48:08] Because as I brought out last week that
[1:48:10] it's not you that fights the battles.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Can I touch on that just a little bit
[1:48:17] yet?
[1:48:20] It's your faith that overcomes. So no
[1:48:22] matter how great the battle is,
[1:48:27] no matter how the battle is,
[1:48:30] God is able to overcome it. God is the
[1:48:33] one that fights your battle for you.
[1:48:37] Amen.
[1:48:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:42] He told Joshua, I believe it was
[1:48:48] in Psalms, it says, [clears throat] "Be
[1:48:50] still and know that I am God."
[1:48:56] Be still. Hold still.
[1:49:01] I love that message.
[1:49:03] Stand still. Amen. Be still. Don't get
[1:49:06] all frustrated over things.
[1:49:10] Don't get all und done. Remember in
[1:49:12] Deuteronomy when they were coming out of
[1:49:15] the wilderness
[1:49:18] and so forth they murmured in their
[1:49:20] tents. Then said I unto you dread not
[1:49:22] neither be afraid of them. How many is
[1:49:26] glad that no matter what comes your way?
[1:49:27] You don't have to be afraid of it.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be scared of it.
[1:49:35] How many is born by the word of God this
[1:49:37] morning?
[1:49:39] born by the spirit.
[1:49:41] Well, guess what? God keeps his word.
[1:49:44] How many believes you're a part of that
[1:49:46] word?
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; So, he keeps that word. As long as
[1:49:50] you're walking in the line of duty.
[1:49:54] Amen. I'll never forget my wife. Amen.
[1:49:57] When she when we got all this news and
[1:49:59] everything, she says, "I'm at my post of
[1:50:01] duty. I'm teaching my grandkids. I'm
[1:50:03] cooking and I'm cleaning. I'm being a
[1:50:05] wife and I'm in my post of duties and I
[1:50:06] ain't scared.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Huh? The devil's got to go.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? She was in her in the
[1:50:13] post of duty. And when you're in the way
[1:50:15] that God wants you to be, how many
[1:50:16] believes that there is your way and then
[1:50:18] there's God's way.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And when you're in THE WAY THAT GOD
[1:50:21] WANTS YOU TO BE AND YOU'RE on his path
[1:50:23] following his word, he keeps you.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; HE'LL NEVER LET YOU GO. [applause]
[1:50:36] He said, "Neither be afraid of them, and
[1:50:38] the Lord YOUR GOD GOETH BEFORE YOU, AND
[1:50:41] HE SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU ACCORDING TO ALL
[1:50:43] that he did for you in Egypt.
[1:50:49] Listen,
[1:50:52] where are Let me see.
[1:50:55] Here they are. Couple of my quotes here
[1:51:01] in Joshua 1, one of my favorite
[1:51:03] chapters,
[1:51:06] he told Joshua, he says, "There shall
[1:51:07] not be any man be able to stand before
[1:51:10] thee all the days of thy life. As I was
[1:51:12] with Moses, so will I be with thee. I
[1:51:14] will not fail thee nor forsake thee."
[1:51:16] How many believes in the New Testament
[1:51:18] Jesus says, "I will never leave you nor
[1:51:20] forsake you." How many believe we got
[1:51:22] the same promise? And you ain't got to
[1:51:24] be afraid of whatever comes your way.
[1:51:26] Whatever is in our future, we don't have
[1:51:28] to be afraid of it. We don't have to be
[1:51:30] dismayed.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not you.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Woo. It's him.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. WHEN JOSHUA WENT ACROSS,
[1:51:46] WHEN WHENEVER JOSHUA CROSSED, DIDN'T GOD
[1:51:49] TELL HIM TO JUST GO AROUND JERICHO SEVEN
[1:51:51] TIMES?
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Go around seven times. And I think on
[1:51:55] the seventh time or so, amen, THEY SAID
[1:51:57] THAT GO SEVEN TIMES THAT DAY. And then
[1:52:00] at the END OF IT, BLOW YOUR TRUMPETS
[1:52:01] [screaming] AND SHOUT.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; WOO. HE DIDN'T SAY, "NOW, IF IT HAD BEEN
[1:52:06] JOSHUA AND THEY SAID, LOOK THESE WALLS
[1:52:08] OF GOD COMING DOWN. I WANT 100,000 OF
[1:52:11] YOU MEN, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THESE
[1:52:13] GREAT BIG SPUD BARS, AND WE'RE GOING TO
[1:52:15] START CHOPPING INTO THIS STEEL INTO this
[1:52:18] uh UH STONE."
[1:52:21] THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS THOUGHT,
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; BUT HE JUST DID WHAT GOD WANTED HIM TO
[1:52:26] DO.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; JUST DO WHAT GOD TELLS YOU TO DO. GOD
[1:52:30] WILL BRING THE OUTCOME.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; HE'LL MAKE IT WORK OUT. DO WHAT GOD
[1:52:34] TELLS YOU TO DO AND GOD WILL TAKE CARE
[1:52:36] OF IT.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; I can't get away from it. I love it.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; yeah. Amen. How many believe that we've
[1:52:46] entered into rest? We we entered into
[1:52:48] rest. The word of God, it it it gives
[1:52:50] you a place of rest.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] A rest in our soul.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Ah, I'll go ahead and say it. Comes to
[1:53:02] my mind. But you get away from God.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; You grieve the Holy Spirit away. You
[1:53:07] have reason to fret, to be scared, to
[1:53:10] run, to be nervous, to be upset, TO BE
[1:53:14] DISMAYED. AH, [screaming]
[1:53:16] YEAH. You got every reason to be. But
[1:53:19] when you're in Christ and you're where
[1:53:21] you're supposed to be and God is in the
[1:53:23] control tower,
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; you don't have to fear anything.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; You are in his hands. Your future's in
[1:53:29] his hands.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Glory. Cuz you don't know. How many
[1:53:35] knows we don't know how bad things are
[1:53:37] going to get. We don't know for sure
[1:53:40] just how things are going to be. Some of
[1:53:42] us sometimes made makes it look like
[1:53:44] before the doors are closed, he going to
[1:53:46] take us up. Other places it looks like
[1:53:47] he'll shut us down.
[1:53:50] Amen. And and and we might get shot for
[1:53:52] going off in prayer for people. Amen. We
[1:53:55] don't know. We don't need things, you
[1:53:57] know, around the corner, but we don't
[1:53:59] have to fear any of it.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. No man shall be able to stand
[1:54:05] before thee. Why? Because we've got the
[1:54:08] other thing that I want to speak on. And
[1:54:09] it may seem off the subject, but how
[1:54:11] many believes that Amen. Jesus said that
[1:54:13] he would the comforter. We've got a
[1:54:15] promise in the word of God that there
[1:54:17] would be a comforter in our life and
[1:54:19] that would be our guide.
[1:54:22] I don't know about you, but I need a
[1:54:23] guide. I need somebody to lead me.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just can't do it by myself.
[1:54:29] Amen. Listen. He says, "I'll never leave
[1:54:31] thee, nor forsake thee." And at the end
[1:54:33] of it, he said, he said, uh, the book of
[1:54:36] the law of course shall not depart. But
[1:54:37] he says, "But have not I commanded thee?
[1:54:40] Be strong and of good courage. Be not
[1:54:42] afraid, neither be dismayed. For the
[1:54:44] Lord thy God, he is with thee
[1:54:46] whethersoever thou goest. Remember when
[1:54:50] David came to Goliath, he says, you
[1:54:51] know, you come with me with sword and
[1:54:53] spear. Amen. You come up with big biceps
[1:54:56] and big muscles and a a mean look and a
[1:54:58] slobbering bunch of mouth and everything
[1:55:00] else, but I'm here to tell you, I don't
[1:55:02] come by my own power. I come to you in
[1:55:04] the name of the Lord of hosts of Israel.
[1:55:07] And today, I'll cut your head off.
[1:55:10] Amen. How many you can say that this
[1:55:12] morning? Amen. That devil might want to
[1:55:14] make it look like this cancer is going
[1:55:15] to eat you up. This high blood pressure
[1:55:17] is going to eat you up. You ain't never
[1:55:18] Do you just tell him, "I don't come by
[1:55:20] my own ability. I come by the power of
[1:55:22] Almighty God. I come to you in the name
[1:55:24] of Jesus Christ. [applause]
[1:55:28] I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. WHATEVER YOUR
[1:55:30] NEED IS THIS MORNING, WHATEVER YOU HAVE
[1:55:32] A GREATER NEED OF, JUST BELIEVE on God.
[1:55:35] God said he would do it." How many
[1:55:37] believes you? If thou can't believe, all
[1:55:39] things are possible. That's God's word.
[1:55:41] God keeps his word. Amen. You take that
[1:55:44] word. You just believe. You just read
[1:55:46] this word. Amen. Like the prophet said,
[1:55:48] "Read this word. You take it into your
[1:55:50] heart. You believe it with all your
[1:55:51] heart." Amen. He said, "God is obligated
[1:55:53] to it." Something's got to give.
[1:55:56] [applause]
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; How many believes that IF THOU CAN HAVE
[1:55:59] FAITH AS THE GRAIN OF A MUSTARD SEED AND
[1:56:02] YOU SAY TO THAT MOUNTAIN, "BE MOVED."
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; HUH? Something has to give.
[1:56:13] God honors. How many believe God honors
[1:56:16] his word by keeping his word? He honors
[1:56:19] his word.
[1:56:22] Three Hebrew children, they trusted the
[1:56:24] Lord with all of their heart. And God
[1:56:27] honored him.
[1:56:29] We don't know if he will, but he can. We
[1:56:32] trust him with everything we have.
[1:56:35] Amen. Coming down to the end. Listen to
[1:56:37] this. He says, "When God made man, he
[1:56:41] made him thus. He made him with a little
[1:56:44] compartment in a man in it for his own
[1:56:46] throne, his control tower.
[1:56:49] God wants to lead man, but man wants to
[1:56:52] lead himself."
[1:56:55] Amen. Therefore, there is a war
[1:56:57] constantly. How many can say, "That's
[1:57:00] right, pastor. That's right, brother
[1:57:02] Ber. THERE EVERY DAY I FIGHT WITH
[1:57:04] MYSELF. I FIGHT IN MY MIND. I'M NOT
[1:57:07] TRYING TO THROW OUT THE WRONG THOUGHTS.
[1:57:10] KEEP THE RIGHT THOUGHTS. KEEP THE RIGHT
[1:57:11] ATTITUDE. WE ALL HAVE THAT. PAUL TALKED
[1:57:14] ABOUT IT. HE SAID THERE'S ALWAYS A
[1:57:15] CONSTANT WAR ABOUT THINGS THAT I WOULD
[1:57:18] NOT THAT I DO SOMETIMES AND AND SO
[1:57:20] FORTH.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. There's always a war going on
[1:57:25] between that first man, between your
[1:57:28] thoughts and his thoughts, between your
[1:57:29] ways and his ways. Amen.
[1:57:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:37] I thank God for what he has done for us
[1:57:41] in this generation to give us a word
[1:57:43] that we can take into our hearts, into
[1:57:46] our minds, and to become it. How many
[1:57:49] believes we got to become it?
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:58] So faith, faith in what? Faith in God's
[1:58:01] ability to take you through is what we
[1:58:04] need. That's how you overcome.
[1:58:07] Well, I got faith in myself. I'M I CAN
[1:58:09] DO THIS. Watch out. [laughter]
[1:58:14] Yeah. Go ahead. Cuz how many knows the
[1:58:16] second that Eve began to think different
[1:58:18] than the word of God. Amen. She went the
[1:58:21] wrong direction.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with man. And if
[1:58:25] you have a carnal mind,
[1:58:28] if you're a makebeliever in the church,
[1:58:30] you will lead that church in the wrong
[1:58:31] direction as soon as I'm standing here.
[1:58:35] Amen.
[1:58:40] All right. Praise the Lord.
[1:58:43] Listen to this.
[1:58:48] He says, "Men, you can't guide yourself.
[1:58:52] There's two ways. That's your way and
[1:58:54] God's way. How many knows Brother
[1:58:56] Abraham said that God's word is his way.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; That's his way.
[1:59:04] Either your way or his way. Amen. And
[1:59:08] when you're in your way, you're out of
[1:59:10] God's way. And you have to forget your
[1:59:12] own way to find God's way. A man cannot
[1:59:15] lead himself.
[1:59:18] Listen to the message called a guide the
[1:59:20] other day. Brother Bam talking about
[1:59:21] being up there and and in those
[1:59:23] mountains trying to hunt. Got a deer and
[1:59:26] hung him up. Remembering the storm came.
[1:59:28] He says, "I better get back." And he
[1:59:30] went back. He he he he he took off. He
[1:59:32] He's a guide. I know my way. Come back,
[1:59:35] I think, two or three times before he
[1:59:38] recognized, "Hey, I'm on a death walk."
[1:59:41] People go crazy on that death walk.
[1:59:46] Can we say that they're on a death walk
[1:59:48] out there and they're going crazy?
[1:59:49] They're losing their minds.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; He said one man did one time was on that
[1:59:54] death walk and his brother came and he
[1:59:56] tried to bite him and fight him and
[1:59:58] everything else. He had completely lost
[2:00:00] his mind.
[2:00:01] And I thought, man, you look at this
[2:00:03] world. They're on a death walk. They go
[2:00:05] round and round and round and round.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Think about this. Didn't brother say
[2:00:09] that Billy Billy Billy Graham in his
[2:00:12] ministry, he would have them come and
[2:00:13] come to the altar. Come to the altar.
[2:00:15] Come to the altar. Right? And every year
[2:00:18] they come to the altar. But they wearied
[2:00:19] themselves to find the door. Never could
[2:00:22] get in the door. I come back and I have
[2:00:24] 30 thou I I I come and I get 30,000
[2:00:27] converts. Come back next year ain't got
[2:00:29] 30. But Abraham says he's not leading
[2:00:31] them all the way. And he said he was
[2:00:33] actually blinding them.
[2:00:37] That's a terrible way to be.
[2:00:41] I was just listening to brother
[2:00:42] Brandham. I think it was uh either last
[2:00:45] night before bed
[2:00:50] or this morning and he's just talking
[2:00:52] about how the people like to adopt
[2:00:54] things and and bypass things. He says,
[2:00:56] "Man, there is nothing like having
[2:00:58] somebody come to the altar." Amen. And
[2:01:00] let him boo. And somebody says, "Oh,
[2:01:02] well, now you've prayed enough." HE
[2:01:04] SAID, "NO, STAY THERE UNTIL YOU GET WHAT
[2:01:06] YOU WANT, WHAT YOU NEED." AMEN. JUST CRY
[2:01:08] OUT.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Don't just go bypassing it.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Get what you want because guess what? If
[2:01:14] you don't get what you what you come for
[2:01:16] the next time you come up, you'll
[2:01:17] probably say, "Well, I didn't get it
[2:01:18] last time." How many know those are all
[2:01:21] the devil's thoughts?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I tried this before and it didn't
[2:01:25] work.
[2:01:27] I tried to overcome this and I couldn't
[2:01:29] do it. Let me tell you something. That's
[2:01:32] all the devil's talk.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care if he takes you a million
[2:01:36] times. You keep right on doing. God will
[2:01:38] take it through. He'll help you. Just
[2:01:40] surrender.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:44] Praise the Lord. All right, back to my
[2:01:46] subject.
[2:01:48] We're not made to guide ourselves.
[2:01:49] [snorts] We're made to follow the Holy
[2:01:52] Spirit, follow the word.
[2:01:58] Didn't finish my story, did I?
[2:02:02] That's right. He went all that three
[2:02:04] times, come back to his dear, and
[2:02:06] realized,
[2:02:07] and he said, he prayed. Brother Brandon
[2:02:10] prayed. Said, "God, you got to help me."
[2:02:12] I thought I was a guide. I am a I am
[2:02:15] boy. He really downed himself. I am not
[2:02:17] a guide. I cannot find my way out. And
[2:02:20] he says, I'm going to do the very best I
[2:02:22] can, Lord. He got up and started to go.
[2:02:25] Ain't that right? And a hand touched him
[2:02:27] on the shoulder, I believe it was. What
[2:02:30] is that? He looked and he heard a voice
[2:02:32] and he turned to look, I believe it was,
[2:02:34] and he seen an opening
[2:02:36] back behind him way over there. They had
[2:02:39] put a some kind of a wire. Ain't that
[2:02:42] right? They had to use used to some kind
[2:02:43] of wire down there so it could get to
[2:02:45] that wire. Amen. Amen. And he and he
[2:02:48] opened up the storm and he saw that over
[2:02:52] there and he says, "I was heading to
[2:02:54] complete towards Canada somewhere." He
[2:02:56] was going the wrong way. How isn't that
[2:02:58] how you and I are without the baptism of
[2:03:01] the Holy Spirit leading and guiding us?
[2:03:03] We'll go completely the wrong way.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:11] Let me say this that the word of God
[2:03:16] in order to really work has to be mixed
[2:03:19] with faith.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4 it says you know they the
[2:03:23] Israelites they had the word the word
[2:03:26] was they had the word but it wasn't
[2:03:28] mixed with faith. Israel did not have
[2:03:30] the faith that they were supposed to
[2:03:31] have. I mean know when Israel come to
[2:03:33] the Red Sea they weren't supposed to say
[2:03:36] hey look let's build a bridge across
[2:03:38] this river. How are we going to Is there
[2:03:40] enough timber in that woods over there
[2:03:43] for us maybe to make a bunch of rafts
[2:03:44] and go across the Red Sea?
[2:03:47] They weren't supposed to do all that. It
[2:03:49] wasn't supposed to be in their own
[2:03:50] ability that day they crossed. God was
[2:03:53] testing them just to see whether they
[2:03:55] would have faith or not. Faith in what?
[2:03:58] Themselves? No, BUT FAITH IN GOD. THEN
[2:04:00] God would make a way. Amen.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; He will make a way when there seems to
[2:04:09] be no way. How many believes that God
[2:04:12] always makes a way?
[2:04:14] Aren't you glad?
[2:04:17] Oh, this this is something that Lord's
[2:04:19] laid on my heart this week to tell you
[2:04:20] people.
[2:04:24] I try to lead the best that I can, teach
[2:04:27] the best that I can, but each and every
[2:04:30] one of us
[2:04:32] according to brother Brandham and the
[2:04:33] Ephesian church age, I believe it was,
[2:04:35] where he talked about the leadership of
[2:04:37] the Holy Spirit, how necessary it is for
[2:04:40] every individual.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; You need a greater leadership than just
[2:04:44] your pastor. You have to follow that
[2:04:47] leadership of the Holy Spirit in your
[2:04:50] heart. And that's what I desire today.
[2:04:52] If I don't say anything else, God, give
[2:04:54] everybody in here that uncction daily
[2:04:58] because I'm getting to the place, Amen,
[2:05:01] that I don't like to do any work. Lord,
[2:05:05] help me to install this countertop. We
[2:05:08] don't know if this thing's going to go
[2:05:09] in here or not.
[2:05:11] Lord, help me with this. Lord, help me
[2:05:13] with that. How many believe? CUZ YOU
[2:05:15] WANT GOD'S LEADERSHIP in everything that
[2:05:17] you do. Not just once, you know. No, but
[2:05:21] in everything. God help us. How many
[2:05:23] believe we all ought to be that way?
[2:05:25] Whether you make a a business deal, I'm
[2:05:27] going to go see this his business
[2:05:29] associate. Don't just go without
[2:05:31] praying. Say, God, you move on his
[2:05:33] heart. And if this is your will, ain't
[2:05:35] that right? How many believes HE'D GO A
[2:05:37] LOT BETTER IF WE'D FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP
[2:05:39] of the Holy Spirit?
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; The early church, Brother Bram said,
[2:05:43] they didn't want to do that. They just
[2:05:44] wanted the preacher tell them, "Hey,
[2:05:46] should I buy this car? Should I not?"
[2:05:48] No, you ought to buy it. Well, what's a
[2:05:49] pre preacher know about whether you
[2:05:51] ought to buy that car or not? [snorts]
[2:05:54] You know, but y'all each one have a
[2:05:56] leadership. God God spoke to my heart.
[2:05:59] So, my heart's desire this morning is
[2:06:01] God give us each one that leadership on
[2:06:03] a daily basis.
[2:06:05] How many believe that we'll be better
[2:06:07] Christians for it if we do?
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; How many knows that? How many in here
[2:06:11] this morning would say with me, Lord, I
[2:06:13] want to be able to hear that voice
[2:06:15] louder than what I do? Amen.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; I want to witness. I want to testify to
[2:06:23] you this morning that I hear that voice
[2:06:25] much louder than what I did six months
[2:06:28] ago.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Cuz it's been my desire,
[2:06:32] Lord. I'm listening.
[2:06:38] And it will it'll tell you what you need
[2:06:40] to know. I'm here to tell you it is. It
[2:06:42] will. And you might not always like it.
[2:06:45] You might not like what he tells you.
[2:06:47] Amen.
[2:06:56] I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
[2:07:00] How many of you God cares about the
[2:07:01] little things that we do?
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; The little things that we do in
[2:07:05] following the Holy Spirit.
[2:07:09] Lately, by God's grace, I've done a lot
[2:07:11] better in keeping the speed limit.
[2:07:14] That's right. Keeping the speed limit.
[2:07:17] You say, "Well, brother, you're wrong
[2:07:19] about this. You're wrong about that." If
[2:07:20] you break a law, if you break one, you
[2:07:23] broke them all.
[2:07:25] Paul said, "Guilty of one is least
[2:07:28] guilty of all."
[2:07:30] So, Lord help us. Isn't that right? How
[2:07:33] many knows there's a reason brother
[2:07:35] Brandham honored God so much that he
[2:07:36] would?
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; He would. So, when I go up and down
[2:07:40] here, I set mine on 64.
[2:07:44] I'm on the back roads 55
[2:07:47] because I'm not I am not never have been
[2:07:50] in my life a person that like to go
[2:07:52] slow.
[2:07:55] And so it's hard. It's hard if you've
[2:07:57] done something for all your life. Hello.
[2:08:00] I think Sister Hannah and Sister Joyce
[2:08:02] one time followed me, didn't you? They
[2:08:05] said, "Brother, many, many, many years
[2:08:07] ago, Sister Hannah said something."
[2:08:09] Brother B, you need to slow down.
[2:08:13] at a wedding or somewhere. I forget
[2:08:15] where it was. But anyway, and I was
[2:08:17] like, "That's right." But you know, I
[2:08:20] believe that if you honor God, God will
[2:08:22] honor you.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; If you don't, then he's not really
[2:08:25] obligated. So, in those little things,
[2:08:27] Lord help us. Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Just those little things that God tells
[2:08:31] us.
[2:08:33] Amen. Because Jesus said that if you're
[2:08:35] not faithful in the little things,
[2:08:36] neither will you be faithful in the big
[2:08:38] things.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; And if you are faithful in the little
[2:08:41] things, you'll be faithful in the big
[2:08:42] things. So God help us. Those are just
[2:08:45] some of the things. Amen. The holy
[2:08:47] there's no telling. I don't know where
[2:08:48] y'all are at. I'd love I don't say I'd
[2:08:51] love to be able to read and see just
[2:08:52] where you are. Prophet God could. But
[2:08:54] you know where you're at. And God knows
[2:08:56] just how to speak to you.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Whether it's to encourage you or text
[2:09:02] this person or repent of this or make
[2:09:04] that right. Amen.
[2:09:09] Amen. You might not you might not look
[2:09:12] at pornography.
[2:09:16] You might not do that.
[2:09:20] But you know the Bible says that as a
[2:09:21] man thinkketh in his heart so is he. How
[2:09:26] many believes you have to watch what you
[2:09:27] even think.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Every thought that goes through your
[2:09:30] mind you want to be careful of.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're living in an age
[2:09:34] where it's very easy to let the wrong
[2:09:36] thoughts come in.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it's not just about the big
[2:09:40] things or whatever, you know. And if you
[2:09:43] do, remember this. You're cheating on
[2:09:45] your wife.
[2:09:46] If you have one,
[2:09:49] you're committing adultery. Whosoever
[2:09:52] lookth upon a woman to lust after has
[2:09:53] committed adultery in his heart already.
[2:09:56] No. All of those things God will the
[2:09:58] Holy Spirit will keep you from. It'll
[2:09:59] it'll correct you if you if anybody's
[2:10:02] doing any of those things.
[2:10:05] Brother Brad, there was none of this was
[2:10:07] on my script. I'm just being honest with
[2:10:09] you. Other than that, I wanted to tell
[2:10:11] you, let's listen to that Holy Spirit on
[2:10:13] the on everything. Amen. And be more
[2:10:15] sensitive to it.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's stand.
[2:10:26] Let's bow our heads and talk to the Holy
[2:10:29] Spirit that's in our hearts.
[2:10:32] Lord Jesus, Father, we feel like you've
[2:10:36] answered prayer this morning. Lord, I
[2:10:39] ask God that you just help me to step it
[2:10:41] out out of the way, Lord, that you would
[2:10:42] speak. And I didn't intend to say those
[2:10:45] things.
[2:10:47] But Lord, I'm I I'm glad of it, Lord
[2:10:49] Jesus, that I didn't. For I realize that
[2:10:52] most of the times when it's not on the
[2:10:53] page, when it's not on the script,
[2:10:56] Lord Jesus, it's certainly you.
[2:10:59] If it wouldn't be, Lord, I would ask
[2:11:01] forgiveness and repent of it, God. But
[2:11:03] we want here at Evening Light
[2:11:04] Tabernacle. We want to be led by you,
[2:11:06] God. We're not here to play church.
[2:11:08] We're not here to be impersonators.
[2:11:11] We're not here to be make believers or
[2:11:13] unbelievers. We're here because we want
[2:11:15] to be genuine believers, followers of
[2:11:18] you, living lives that are pleasing to
[2:11:20] you, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:22] every thought that we think Lord Jesus
[2:11:24] that it would be the way that you would
[2:11:26] think about things Lord Jesus every
[2:11:28] action that we have that would express
[2:11:30] Christ Lord. So we humbly bow before you
[2:11:33] God this morning Lord Jesus saying take
[2:11:36] our hearts Lord fill that void Lord
[2:11:39] Jesus where Lord perhaps there's an
[2:11:41] emptiness I ask if there's any in here
[2:11:43] like that that you'll fill them with the
[2:11:45] spirit of God and help us to realize
[2:11:48] every day that there's nothing as
[2:11:50] important as our walk with you Lord our
[2:11:52] business and our everything else is not
[2:11:54] as important as hearing your voice
[2:11:58] and fellowshipping with you and waiting
[2:12:00] for the time when you come to call us
[2:12:02] home, God. And Lord, we raise our hands
[2:12:04] and say, "God, forgive me, Lord Jesus,
[2:12:06] where I've failed you, Lord,
[2:12:09] where I'm not what I ought to be, I ask,
[2:12:11] God, that you'd help me to listen to
[2:12:13] that still small voice, Father. The
[2:12:16] pastor may never preach about it. He may
[2:12:18] not have said anything about it, but I
[2:12:20] know because you show me. You speak to
[2:12:23] my heart and you tell me about it, Lord.
[2:12:25] And I just, Father, I want to follow you
[2:12:28] in whatever you tell me to do." We ask
[2:12:30] God that you'll take each and everyone
[2:12:32] this morning, Lord Jesus, to a [music]
[2:12:34] deeper walk with you, Father. A greater
[2:12:36] love for you, Lord Jesus. A greater love
[2:12:39] one for another, Lord. Lord, we'd give
[2:12:42] the very church off of our back to each
[2:12:43] other, Lord, if they needed it, Lord.
[2:12:46] And Father, this morning, we want to
[2:12:48] remember those that have not been
[2:12:49] feeling well. Brother Joe, Lord Jesus,
[2:12:52] each and every one that's been
[2:12:53] mentioned, Lord Jesus, serenity haven,
[2:12:56] Lord Jesus, and SA, [snorts]
[2:12:59] we already heard a report that it's one
[2:13:02] of them. Sale, I believe it's better,
[2:13:03] Father. And we thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:06] And we believe, God, that you'll deliver
[2:13:08] him completely, Lord Jesus, this
[2:13:09] morning, Father. Lord, brother Joe's
[2:13:12] been asking God for strength and for
[2:13:14] energy, Lord. And we ask God, you've
[2:13:16] give him strength and energy, Lord
[2:13:17] Jesus. For we none of us feel good, it's
[2:13:20] not wonderful. It's not good at all if
[2:13:22] we don't have any energy or strength,
[2:13:23] Lord. And Father, I pray for the
[2:13:25] strength and energy of this church. May
[2:13:27] it surge, God. May each one of us, Lord,
[2:13:30] have a power surge, Father, so to speak,
[2:13:32] of the Holy Spirit to help us to be able
[2:13:35] to live this coming week, Lord, in the
[2:13:37] peace of God, knowing, God, that you
[2:13:40] fight our battles for us, Lord. And we
[2:13:43] surrender to you, Lord. And we watch you
[2:13:45] do it. We stand [music] still and know
[2:13:48] one thing, and that is that you are God.
[2:13:52] We love you with all of our heart now.
[2:13:54] Commit ourselves to you in Jesus name.
[2:13:57] Amen. And amen. God bless you. I know we
[2:14:00] went a little long this morning, I
[2:14:02] guess, with no Sunday school and all,
[2:14:04] but it's all right, isn't it?
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:11] God bless you.

[2:15:49] And who
[2:15:51] with me my burden [singing and music]
[2:15:54] shares?
[2:15:57] None but me.

[2:16:54] for [music] me shall be no [singing]
[2:16:57] more.
[2:17:00] Won't [music] you guide

[2:17:52] [music]
[2:17:52] [singing]
[2:17:54] Amen.
[2:17:56] Amen. Can we sing one of them? KFG.
[2:18:00] Well, I'm one of them.
[2:18:03] [singing] I'm one of them.
[2:18:08] And I'm so glad that I [music] can say
[2:18:11] I'm one of them.
[2:18:15] I'm [singing and music] one of them.

[2:18:27] of them. [music]
[2:18:30] And there are people [singing]
[2:18:32] almost [music] everywhere whose hearts
[2:18:35] are all the flame with the
[2:18:38] [music and singing] fire that fell at
[2:18:40] Pentecost which cleans and made them
[2:18:44] clean. It is burning now within my soul.
[2:18:49] Oh, [music] glory to his name. I'm so
[2:18:53] glad that I can say I'm [music] one of
[2:18:57] them.
