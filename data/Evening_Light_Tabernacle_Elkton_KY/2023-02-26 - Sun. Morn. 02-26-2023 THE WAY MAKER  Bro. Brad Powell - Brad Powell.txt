and he said well I want you to think and he said I want everybody in the room to turn their backs nothing bad's gonna happen girl just a vampire and he said do you see that bracelet on that chandelier he said if you have faith make that bracelet go left and right and circle and stuff and she said that spirituality brother Brown that can't be done he said you don't have faith amen I want my faith to be built up I want to have more of that possible and attitude that positive faith that he says faith is positive so I gotta get all the negative out of my life and see positive results Glory Hercules sometimes phenomenal happen in my life and my sixth grade year I'm terrible at times the dates I'll do the best I can but something phenomenal matter this is when I first saw my wife all right I knew that would give a shot sorry and you're going to say this is we were at a ball game remember like it was yesterday I was in the staff she was on the court playing ball she was playing for Cleveland days I was a help to know we won't talk about the traveling violation that ones that hang from 50 Blue Jays at the end of the game but I was sitting there at the top of the bleachers I could go to the spot today saw her on the court my best friend was sitting beside me and I said I wonder who that is he said who I said that girl right there that's my cousin I said I'm being married sixth grade he's like well let's just puppy love and we see you know no no there was something that I really knew there was something I mean we had cancer whatever you know but now that was something I said I want to marry her from my uncle Billy [Applause] so time goes on never say her again until maybe a year or two later when the schools consolidate that like I said I think it was a year I walk in and I'll see you again there she is that's that's her that's the one I saw at the game so I couldn't listen you got six seven eight great boys are but I guess I got her attention and we started liking each other who started you know boyfriend girlfriend whatever [Music] but it was it was one of those things that it was a middle school thing you know we get out of school summer break whatever and we go on our own ways and and things are you know she does her thing and I think mine we're setting right away until about sophomore year we have class together another kind of connection there and I'm sitting there and I promise this is the way it went all right [Music] again [Music] it's gonna work out after all so we go along we go home and we go on this and we begin today you know the story it's the fairy tale right and things are going good about that time then I started coming to church here and so I started coming to church here and uh when I was 16 I think it was really about five dollars per Seer here he's just been elected or selected him and to take the church and so I'm getting there and I start coming to church here and uh and I know this was something completely different than any Services I would have been to but I know it was something different that I liked I think there's something different that made it more more realistic to me [Music] kind of regardless and so I began to read my Bible and I began to go through it and Things become clearer first thing I can remember that stood out to me is like this is an operator because for years I've wondered about the what happened in the garden about an apple what does that have to do with any sin and then when I say in the services I'm like well this people might think this is crazy but an Apple's even more crazy baptism can't make sense father son I don't want to go it's a three year one father's title you know the story you know how it is that's how I began to say this is this is what I'm hoping for and so there are long about that time uh brother Daniel Williams comes in business precious preciousness a person and it makes you feel appreciative and the next thing you know I'm going to be re-baptized I was baptized in my Christian church but now I say baptized in Jesus name and so I keep between myself I need to be baptized so we pulled the tarp off and brother Brian sister genetics and they had to talk because it was cold brother Williams baptized me there and then as time went on there was a little move on my stuff so our little young group here brother Billy sister Nancy my mother-in-law father-in-law mother camps or churches and next thing you know let them bought a tour bus that belong to Confederate railroads and we got us John drove his little land Minefield and some army base about Lewis on the road two o'clock in the morning field we've been driving two of us and we've got these meetings and these meetings start to really impact my life I remember going to Dyersburg erase wrestling The Thrillers one of my favorite messages ever and I stepped out on the set somewhere other than a way to play them but I still got them on the set and I remember going to Louisiana Camp brother Bissell preacher ye shall see the resurrection now he preached that something would not let my feet in my middle space let's see I didn't care if Joyce went whoever was sorry it didn't matter I was going to the front of the church on the mission I had to get up there and and just go through that prayer line because enjoy your life people impacted people you know people you don't even think about and what they're doing at the time you realize how it impacts your life but I can remember at the time that we were dating when we were dating we'd be sitting in the living room nearly a man's a day third bedroom was right on the other side of the wall that's where they slept at the time and I thought wow crazy for me amen let everybody knows around huh you know but not least that atmosphere to God and saying God you take control of it yes that's right so along without 18 so with love a good way to get married and we got engaged and got married at 19. just remember now I told you that I was taught that I could believe I believe that I could have anything I want to do so I decided if we're going to build a long house 18 years old doing something that nobody in the county had ever done the way we're doing it the banker told me that he said are you sure what about this yeah like a little bit so we sprayed the laws and we scraped the laws got the bark off of them her daddy song for us they said you gotta have a place to live so we did that
