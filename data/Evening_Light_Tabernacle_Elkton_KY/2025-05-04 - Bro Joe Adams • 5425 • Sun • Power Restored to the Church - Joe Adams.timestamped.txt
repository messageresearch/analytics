[16:14] Say amen when you find it.
[16:18] I will praise thee, O Lord, with my

[16:24] marvelous
[16:35] works. back. They shall fall and perish
[16:38] at thy presence.

[16:49] destroyed the wicked. Thou hast put out
[16:52] their name forever and ever.
[16:55] [Music]
[17:04] But the Lord shall endure forever. He
[17:07] hath prepared his throne for judgment.
[17:17] The Lord also will be a refuge for the
[17:20] oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.

[17:35] in Zion. Declare among the people his
[17:38] doings.
[17:47] Have mercy upon me, O Lord. Consider my
[17:49] trouble which I suffer of them that hate
[17:52] me. Thou that liftest me up from the
[17:54] gates of death.

[18:20] the the wicked shall be turned into hell
[18:23] and the nations that forget God.
[18:33] Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail. Let

[22:31] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. We
[22:36] have a Lord's blessed us over the last
[22:38] several months. Amen. The Lord's growing
[22:40] the church a little bit. Amen. By the
[22:41] grace and help of the Lord. Amen. And so
[22:44] we're uh we're just so glad to have
[22:47] brother Devon and Sister Jana. Amen.
[22:50] Horning with us this morning. We're just
[22:52] Amen. privileged they forsaken all.
[22:54] Amen. To forsaken all. Left all behind.
[22:57] Amen. To go to a church where they
[23:00] preach the full gospel. Amen. To where
[23:03] they can grow in the Lord and go as
[23:04] deep. Amen. As the Holy Spirit leads.
[23:07] Jesus said, "I have yet many things to
[23:10] say unto you, but I cannot now. But when
[23:12] the sp Holy Spirit, when the comforter
[23:13] has come, he will tell you. He will lead
[23:16] you into all truth. So, how many knows
[23:17] there's more truth to go into? Jesus
[23:20] couldn't say it all. Amen. And so, when
[23:22] you put a period behind what you
[23:23] believe, you get in a lot of trouble.
[23:25] You got to keep a comma. Amen. And
[23:27] that's what a lot of churches have done.
[23:28] Well, this is what we believe. And if
[23:30] you show us more light and more truth
[23:31] and we're wrong, we're just not
[23:33] accepting that truth. We're going to
[23:35] stay with what we we want to believe.
[23:37] And as you can see whether it's all the
[23:39] different traditions, the different
[23:40] things that people uh you know we could
[23:43] go a long ways on it but people pretty
[23:45] much want to have the kind of religion
[23:46] whatever they want they want to add to
[23:48] the Bible where they want to add on it
[23:50] or make you do this that or the other
[23:52] that's not even scriptural. You know how
[23:54] many knows the pope is the perfect
[23:56] example of that. Catholicism is the
[23:58] mother of organized religion. Amen. And
[24:01] they made Peter they said Peter was the
[24:03] first pope. I'm sorry but Peter wasn't
[24:05] the first pope. He was a married man.
[24:07] first to be to begin with. Ain't that
[24:08] right? And so it's just, you know, they
[24:10] just do what they want. They think they
[24:12] can change it where they want and so
[24:14] forth. But Amen. But we want to pray
[24:16] with them. Amen. As they uh
[24:19] have God has laid on their heart to
[24:22] journey with us. Amen. And so we want to
[24:24] ask God's blessing on them. If y'all
[24:25] would come up this morning and we just
[24:27] want to pray, Amen. God's blessing to
[24:29] rest upon you. And Amen. that brother
[24:31] Brad if you'll come and just ask God
[24:33] that he would help them. Amen. We how
[24:35] many knows? We just want to uh ask that
[24:38] God uh that they would be able to be
[24:41] edified here because that's what the
[24:43] five-fold ministry is for is for the
[24:45] edification of the body of Christ. And
[24:48] make you may you two grow into the full
[24:50] stature of Christ. Everything that the
[24:53] scripture says that we should be. Amen.
[24:55] Like pe second Peter 1, I think it is
[24:58] said, add to your uh faith knowledge and
[25:01] temperance and virtue and patience and
[25:04] godliness. and then cap it off with
[25:06] perfect love. Amen. Amen. And so may you
[25:09] grow into that stature and we know that
[25:11] that is a journey. Amen. So u and we
[25:14] just pray that we'll be able to be a
[25:15] blessing to y'all. Amen. And we are
[25:19] behind you. Amen. Anything you ever
[25:21] need, the saints, we are a body here.
[25:24] Amen. Anything you ever need, you just
[25:26] let us know. Amen. We'll do all that we
[25:28] can to help them. Amen. On this life's
[25:30] journey. Amen. And may we grow to the
[25:32] rapture together. Amen. And how many of
[25:34] these? That's our goal is to meet the
[25:36] Lord in the air and to be ready to meet
[25:38] the Lord in the air. Amen. Amen. Lord
[25:42] Jesus, we come before you this morning,
[25:44] Lord. And we just asking, God, that
[25:46] you'll just bless Brother Devon and
[25:47] Sister Jana, Father, as they walk with
[25:49] us, Lord Jesus, towards that rapture,
[25:52] towards that meeting in the air, Lord,
[25:54] looking ourselves, examining ourselves
[25:56] to see whether we're in the faith or
[25:58] not, ever growing closer to you, Lord
[26:00] Jesus, as we listen to your Holy Spirit
[26:02] speaking to us daily, monthly, weekly,
[26:06] hourly, every minute, Lord, listening to
[26:09] what you're saying to us, Father,
[26:11] changing us from glory to glory, making
[26:13] us better Christians, Lord, each time
[26:16] that we come to church, we examine
[26:17] ourselves to see, Lord, where we can be
[26:19] better than what we were before, Father.
[26:22] And we ask your blessing upon this
[26:23] couple, Lord Jesus, as we journey with
[26:25] them now, Father. May their every
[26:27] footsteps reflect Jesus Christ. And may
[26:29] they grow into the perfect image of
[26:31] Christ and what you have imagined and
[26:33] thought of for them to be and for all of
[26:36] us, Lord. Bind this church together ever
[26:38] more, Lord Jesus. And help us, Lord
[26:41] Jesus, to thwart the enemy at every
[26:43] turn. Amen. And to quench every fiery
[26:45] dart of the wicked, Lord. Grant them
[26:47] faith, Lord Jesus, and love like never

[37:38] took your

[37:43] away. But since that day, oh

[52:30] God. Yes, he
[52:33] is. Well, he may not come when you want

[52:58] a God.
[53:02] Yes. Well, he may not come when you want
[53:07] him, but he'll be there right away.
[53:14] [Music]
[53:20] That's right. Alrighty. I'd like to take
[53:23] about one minute and just tell you guys
[53:26] something. This morning on our way to
[53:28] church with my lovely wife driving, all
[53:31] of a sudden I went into a tunnel vision
[53:35] and it was like I wasn't even there.
[53:39] So I told the men when we were in the
[53:42] prayer room and they prayed for me.
[53:44] Brother Joe, Brother,
[53:48] uh, Brother David, Brother
[53:51] Steve, all of the good saints in this
[53:55] church, they prayed for me. And guess
[53:57] what? We're going to stay for the second
[53:59] service, honey.
[54:05] Okay, that's right. The Lord is good. He
[54:09] just said, "Man up and let's do it."
[54:11] Okay. All right. Here's a little song
[54:14] for
[54:15] [Music]
[54:27] you. I believe our steps are
[54:31] growing weirier each day.
[54:35] Still I got a journey on my
[54:40] mind. Lures of this old world have
[54:44] ceased to make me want to stay. And my
[54:48] one regret is leaving you behind.
[54:54] But if it proves to be his will that I
[54:58] am first to cross and somehow I have a
[55:02] feeling it will
[55:06] be when it comes your turn to travel.
[55:10] Likewise don't feel lost for I will be
[55:15] the first one that you'll see.
[55:19] I'll be waiting on the far side banks of
[55:24] Jordan. I'll be sitting drawing pictures
[55:29] in the
[55:31] sand. And when I see you coming, I will
[55:36] rise up with a shout and come running
[55:40] through the shallow water, reaching for
[55:43] your hand.
[55:47] [Music]
[55:59] Through this life, we've labored long to
[56:03] earn our meager fair. It's brought us
[56:06] trembling hands and failing eyes.
[56:12] So, I'll just rest here on that shore
[56:15] and turn my eyes
[56:17] away until you come. Then we'll see
[56:23] paradise. And I'll be waiting on the far
[56:26] side banks of
[56:29] Jordan. I'll be sitting drawing pictures
[56:33] in the sand.
[56:37] And when I see you coming, I will rise
[56:41] up with a shout. Handcuff running
[56:44] through the shallow water, reaching for
[56:48] your
[56:48] [Music]
[56:49] hand. And I'll be waiting on the far
[56:53] side banks of
[56:56] Jordan. I'll be sitting drawing pictures
[57:00] in the sand.
[57:04] And when I see you coming, I will rise
[57:08] up with a shout and come running through
[57:12] the shallow water, reaching for your
[57:16] hand. I'll be running through the
[57:20] shallow water, reaching for your hand.
[57:26] [Music]
[57:29] [Applause]
[57:34] Amen. God bless you.
[57:36] Amen. I I appreciate brother Glenn,
[57:39] don't you? And Amen. I you know, I love
[57:43] their testimony, him and Sister Sherry.
[57:46] It's always
[57:47] positive. And you know, her cancer,
[57:49] she's had cancer for a while, and she
[57:51] said, "It's getting this much better,
[57:53] but it's getting this much better." And
[57:55] I think of that song Little by Little.
[57:58] Sister Sherry, God's going to heal you
[58:00] completely. Amen. And what a day it'll
[58:03] be when we get over there, won't it? My
[58:06] there won't be no sugar diabetes. They
[58:07] won't be no overweight people. And my
[58:11] brother Joe was talking about he didn't
[58:12] feel like walking and running. And I
[58:15] thought, boy, we'll be shouting over
[58:17] there, Brother Joe. They won't be no
[58:18] worried about walking. God bless you,
[58:20] Sister Zoe and Sister Lauren and the
[58:22] girls are going to sing Come Ahead this
[58:24] morning. God bless you.
[58:51] [Music]
[59:07] You made a covenant with me. Signed by
[59:12] the blood that still speaks. Now I'm
[59:16] forgiven. I'm called rightuous. I'm made
[59:22] clean. And there at the cross of
[59:26] Calary, you gave it all to purchase me.
[59:31] You are the Savior and the God who sets
[59:35] me
[59:38] free. Now my heart cries, this is my
[59:44] redeemer.
[59:47] With my whole life, I will give you
[59:53] praise and all the
[59:57] glory to the one who's
[1:00:01] worthy because of
[1:00:05] Jesus. I have been changed.
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:12] You made a way for me to enter into your
[1:00:17] holy place forever. Now I am hid and I
[1:00:22] am covered. I found
[1:00:26] peace and into your likeness you
[1:00:30] transformed me, making me holy like
[1:00:33] you're holy. No longer
[1:00:36] I Christ who lives in
[1:00:41] me. Now my heart Christ. This is my
[1:00:47] redeemer.
[1:00:50] with my whole life. I will give you
[1:00:56] praise and all the
[1:01:00] glory to the one who's
[1:01:04] worthy because of
[1:01:08] Jesus. I have a change.
[1:01:13] You bring freedom to the
[1:01:17] captives, good news to the
[1:01:21] poor, healing to the
[1:01:24] broken, and joy to those who mourn. You
[1:01:28] turn ashes into
[1:01:32] beauty. Ruins you to restore.
[1:01:36] I am a
[1:01:38] testimony of the goodness of the Lord.
[1:01:43] You bring freedom to the

[1:05:34] but I hope they're ready to be filled up
[1:05:36] by his presence, his power. Well, we
[1:05:39] certainly count it an honor to be here
[1:05:41] with you again. We greet you in the name
[1:05:42] of the Lord Jesus. And want to say,
[1:05:45] Brother Thomas, thank you for the invite
[1:05:47] and the confidence you have in us to
[1:05:49] have us back. And you know, your pastor
[1:05:51] and I, we we got to spend the last
[1:05:53] couple days together making great
[1:05:54] memories. We made great memories last
[1:05:56] year. We made even better memories this
[1:05:58] year. We're not going to tell it. We'll
[1:06:00] start laughing. But we had some good
[1:06:01] times together. And count it an honor to
[1:06:04] be here with him. I count him as a
[1:06:05] special friend. And I love you, brother
[1:06:06] Thomas, and thank you for your
[1:06:08] friendship. And we have Mimi and Poppy
[1:06:10] here with us this morning. And you know,
[1:06:12] there's something about Mimi. She
[1:06:14] There's people that you just meet for
[1:06:16] the first time and they just instantly
[1:06:17] grow on you. Come on, anybody? Come on.
[1:06:21] Come on. We're just family here this
[1:06:22] morning. Well, when I met Mimi and
[1:06:24] Poppy, they just grew on me real quick.
[1:06:27] And there's something about Mimi she's
[1:06:29] not going to tell you. Deep down inside
[1:06:32] that UK blood, there's a stream of
[1:06:34] orange that that just flows down. She's
[1:06:37] a secret Tennessee fan.
[1:06:42] She's like, "No, you
[1:06:44] don't." She despises Tennessee. But you
[1:06:48] know what? We're going to have to
[1:06:50] convert her. But that's all right. We'll
[1:06:51] work on that another time. But we're
[1:06:53] certainly glad to have y'all with us
[1:06:54] this morning. So, thank you for for
[1:06:56] coming and we uh we trust that the Lord
[1:06:58] will bless you in this service. I want
[1:07:00] to uh if we could this morning just go
[1:07:02] to prayer and then we're going to pick
[1:07:03] up here in Acts three. I want to speak
[1:07:06] to you what I ministered on the last
[1:07:07] couple weeks ago when I was here on
[1:07:09] power restored to the church.
[1:07:12] And I I'm struggling over the subtitle
[1:07:14] stimulated by revelation or as brother
[1:07:17] Glenn would say, man up and let's do it.
[1:07:20] I mean, brother Glenn, I was back there.
[1:07:22] That just fired me up. Sometimes we just
[1:07:25] need to man up.
[1:07:27] Take God at his word and just do it and
[1:07:29] say, "Lord, it ain't up to me. It's up
[1:07:31] to you. You gave the promise. It's in
[1:07:33] your word. I believe it. I don't care
[1:07:34] how I feel. I don't care what I'm
[1:07:36] looking at. It doesn't matter how far my
[1:07:38] kids are straying. I'm going to man up.
[1:07:40] I'm going to believe. I'm going to take
[1:07:42] you at your word and I'm going to trust
[1:07:43] in the impossible because he's God. So,
[1:07:46] let's just go to him in prayer. Father,
[1:07:48] we bow our hearts and our heads to you
[1:07:50] today, Lord. And what a great privilege
[1:07:52] we have as your people to come in your
[1:07:54] house, Lord, to honor you, to set the
[1:07:56] cares of life aside just for a few
[1:07:58] minutes this morning and invite the King
[1:08:00] of Kings and the Lord of Lords into our
[1:08:02] midst. But Lord, we don't invite you
[1:08:04] just in these four walls, but we invite
[1:08:06] you into the corridors of our heart this
[1:08:09] morning. God, may you minister to every
[1:08:11] heart, every life, every need, every
[1:08:13] family situation. God, do what man's not
[1:08:16] able to do. Lord, a man can study and he
[1:08:19] can labor into the word, but Father, it
[1:08:21] takes your anointing. It takes your
[1:08:23] direction to go down that vein, Lord
[1:08:25] God, and minister to a need and minister
[1:08:27] to a heart, Lord, and move a man off his
[1:08:30] notes, per se, Father, and just speak to
[1:08:32] the people. So, Lord, we're here as a
[1:08:34] willing vessel this morning, and we're
[1:08:36] inviting you to speak, Lord. You see the
[1:08:38] needs in the body this morning. Those
[1:08:40] that raised their hands, Father, great
[1:08:42] need that's represented there. May you
[1:08:44] meet that need. May we go out of this
[1:08:46] place, Lord. And may we be like those on
[1:08:48] the road to us. May then our hearts burn
[1:08:50] within us as he talked with us. Lord,
[1:08:53] it's not me as a man talking to him, but
[1:08:55] it's me as a willing vessel yielded, set
[1:08:57] aside, and allowing the spirit of God to
[1:08:59] to speak to the people today, Father.
[1:09:01] So, we we just invite you and ask that
[1:09:03] you bless his service now in Jesus name.
[1:09:06] Amen. And amen. So, Acts 3 and verse
[1:09:09] one, it says, "Now Peter and John went
[1:09:10] up together to the temple at the hour of
[1:09:12] prayer, being the ninth hour, and a
[1:09:15] certain lame man from his mother's womb
[1:09:17] was carried, whom they laid daily at the
[1:09:19] gate of the temple, which is called
[1:09:21] beautiful, to ask alms of them that
[1:09:23] entered into the temple, who seeing
[1:09:25] Peter and John about to go into the
[1:09:27] temple, asked of alms. And Peter
[1:09:30] fastening his eyes upon him with John
[1:09:32] said, Look on us." And he gave heed unto
[1:09:34] them, expecting to receive something of
[1:09:36] them. And Peter said, "Silver and gold
[1:09:38] have I none, but such as I have give I
[1:09:40] thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:09:43] Nazareth, rise up and walk." And he took
[1:09:45] him by the hand or by the right hand and
[1:09:48] lifted him up. And immediately his feet
[1:09:50] and his ankle bones received
[1:09:52] strength. Does Bible doesn't say he sat
[1:09:54] back down.
[1:09:57] Come on, church. Bible doesn't say he
[1:10:00] was quiet as a church mouse. He was
[1:10:01] afraid of what just happened. He was
[1:10:03] terrified about what just took place.
[1:10:06] The Bible says that he leaping up stood
[1:10:08] and walked and entered in with them into
[1:10:11] the temple. Notice where he went
[1:10:12] immediately after his healing. Bible
[1:10:15] said he went to church. He went into the
[1:10:17] synagogue walking and leaping and
[1:10:19] praising God.
[1:10:22] And all the people, not just a handful
[1:10:24] of the people, but all the people saw
[1:10:27] him walking and praising God. And they
[1:10:29] knew that it was he which sat for arms
[1:10:32] at the beautiful gate of the temple. And
[1:10:34] they were filled with wonder and
[1:10:36] amazement at that which would happened
[1:10:38] unto him. God bless you. You can have
[1:10:40] your seats this
[1:10:42] morning. Also, before we get started, I
[1:10:44] did want to say thank you for welcoming
[1:10:47] my daughter Lauren into your church,
[1:10:49] into your lives. She's a special girl
[1:10:51] and Weston's got one of the best in
[1:10:53] Louisiana had to offer. I believe he
[1:10:55] knows
[1:10:56] that. Come on. Yeah. I believe
[1:11:00] that not just cuz she's my daughter, but
[1:11:03] it does
[1:11:04] help. But I want to look here this
[1:11:06] morning on powered restored to the
[1:11:10] church. And we have two services days
[1:11:12] and I have plenty of material. So I had
[1:11:14] to figure out where we're going to cut
[1:11:15] and divide. But we're going to do a
[1:11:16] two-part series this morning picking
[1:11:18] back up and maybe we'll have to even
[1:11:20] continue at later services. And you
[1:11:22] know, sometimes as good as a minister,
[1:11:24] you you can kind of carry a th several
[1:11:26] times and several, you know, services
[1:11:28] through just to kind of drive different
[1:11:30] points of it because it's too much just
[1:11:32] to be able to take it in one service,
[1:11:34] especially when we only have an hour
[1:11:35] because there's not much, you know, our
[1:11:37] bottoms can't handle much more than an
[1:11:39] hour, hour and 15, 20 minutes. Your
[1:11:41] stomachs can't handle it either. Come
[1:11:43] on, smile this morning. But we look here
[1:11:46] and we find Peter and John, as we said
[1:11:48] last time, they just left Pentecost. And
[1:11:50] here they going, they go into the temple
[1:11:52] about the hour of prayer. And they find
[1:11:55] this lame man. He's got his cup up,
[1:11:57] raising it up, asking. You know,
[1:11:59] sometimes we come to church. You know,
[1:12:00] maybe we're a little bit more desperate
[1:12:02] than others. Other services or times we
[1:12:04] got our cup lifted up. Fill my cup,
[1:12:06] Lord. I need a touch this morning. Lord,
[1:12:08] there's things going on in my life,
[1:12:10] Lord. There's things in my family that I
[1:12:11] don't understand or situations that I
[1:12:13] can't figure out. I have my cup lifted,
[1:12:15] Lord, and you're just waiting for
[1:12:17] somebody to drop something into that
[1:12:18] cup. Well, here they come. John and
[1:12:21] Peter come to the the house of God in
[1:12:23] the hour of prayer to be made. And
[1:12:25] Peter, no doubt full of compassion,
[1:12:27] looked down and saw this beggar. You
[1:12:29] know, he didn't have money. He didn't
[1:12:31] have wealth. He didn't have silver. He
[1:12:33] didn't have gold. But he had something
[1:12:34] that far exceeded money. He had
[1:12:37] something inside of him that went far
[1:12:39] beyond the value of silver and gold. He
[1:12:42] had met Jesus Christ. Notice, not only
[1:12:45] did he meet G, he met the person behind
[1:12:48] the person of Jesus. He met the power
[1:12:50] behind the man that opened blinded eyes.
[1:12:53] The power that raised the dead, a power
[1:12:56] that healed the sick, a power that gave
[1:12:58] that gave strength to the the weak and
[1:13:00] feeble. He met the God of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:06] No, he walked with them for three and a
[1:13:08] half years, but it's one thing to walk
[1:13:10] with them, but it's another thing to
[1:13:12] have him dwelling on the inside of you.
[1:13:14] So, when he went to Pentecost, no longer
[1:13:17] was it story time where well, I fish
[1:13:19] with them and no, he said, "Let down the
[1:13:21] net." And I let it down. And you know, I
[1:13:24] argue with him a little bit cuz I'm a
[1:13:25] fisherman and I was born to do this and
[1:13:27] you know, we just went to those waters.
[1:13:30] But when he said, "Let down the net."
[1:13:32] And there was something inside of me. He
[1:13:33] said, "You better obey. You better
[1:13:35] listen. You better do what he says." And
[1:13:37] I let down the net. And we caught a
[1:13:39] whole draw of fish.
[1:13:41] Oh, but I'm talking to you about there's
[1:13:43] something greater than this that was now
[1:13:45] living on the inside of Peter. There was
[1:13:48] something more powerful than just doing
[1:13:50] what he said, but now was acting in his
[1:13:52] behalf.
[1:13:56] You know here they are
[1:13:58] going going to the temple and this
[1:14:01] compassion overwhelmed Peter. You know
[1:14:03] sometimes as a minister the compassion
[1:14:05] for the needs of the people overwhelm
[1:14:07] you. You wish you had the ability to
[1:14:11] remove them from the situation. You wish
[1:14:15] you had the
[1:14:16] answer to their life's question. or you
[1:14:20] wish you can take and then put your
[1:14:23] hands on them immediately and see them
[1:14:24] recover
[1:14:27] because you're full of
[1:14:28] compassion. And we find here Peter, you
[1:14:32] know what did Peter have? And I love how
[1:14:34] brother Ben would tell us in what does
[1:14:36] the Holy Ghost he said what he had? He
[1:14:38] had faith.
[1:14:42] Faith. Because notice without faith it's
[1:14:45] impossible to please God. I don't care
[1:14:48] how long you've been a a believer. I
[1:14:50] don't care how long you've been a member
[1:14:52] of the church. I don't care how long,
[1:14:54] you know, if you you dressed right and
[1:14:56] you did all the right things. And
[1:14:57] there's a lot of people doing a lot of
[1:14:59] right things and don't have faith.
[1:15:02] But notice when Jesus says, you know,
[1:15:04] when he comes back, will he find faith?
[1:15:07] He's looking for faith in a people.
[1:15:10] People that will take him at his word,
[1:15:12] not take what the doctors say, not take
[1:15:15] the doctor's report. Well, you got this
[1:15:17] and you got that and you know it's a box
[1:15:19] of rattlesnakes and you know and
[1:15:20] everybody loves the UPS
[1:15:22] man. We love to get packages at our
[1:15:25] house. Let me tell you, I don't like the
[1:15:27] wrong packages. If it ain't got my name
[1:15:30] on it, kick it over to the neighbor's
[1:15:32] house, I don't want it. And if it's a
[1:15:34] box of rattlesnakes, I definitely don't
[1:15:36] want it. Don't sign for something that
[1:15:38] don't belong to you this morning. You're
[1:15:40] a child of God. You're a son of God.
[1:15:42] You're a daughter of God. God's got
[1:15:44] promises stored up for you. Don't accept
[1:15:47] something that don't belong to you
[1:15:48] today.
[1:15:51] But Peter had faith in the word of God.
[1:15:55] And not only that, he had faith in the
[1:15:57] God that he met. He had faith in what
[1:16:00] just happened to him at Pentecost
[1:16:03] because now his life was forever
[1:16:05] changed.
[1:16:07] Tommy, there's no going back to that
[1:16:09] lifestyle.
[1:16:11] Brother Glenn, there's no going back to
[1:16:13] that lifestyle. Come on, somebody.
[1:16:15] Preach with me this morning. There ain't
[1:16:17] no going back because you met the God of
[1:16:19] the Bible. No longer. You didn't just
[1:16:22] meet him in a church service. You didn't
[1:16:24] just meet him by reading your Bible, but
[1:16:26] he came by the Holy Ghost power and
[1:16:29] filled you.
[1:16:32] The God of the Bible now dwelling in
[1:16:35] humanity.
[1:16:37] And Peter says, "I got faith." Yeah.
[1:16:42] See,
[1:16:43] something something got in his heart.
[1:16:47] I remember when I got filled with the
[1:16:48] Holy Ghost,
[1:16:50] right? My there's never no going back.
[1:16:53] Woke up one day and my my my the desires
[1:16:56] changed, the nature changed, everything
[1:16:58] just seem to change.
[1:17:02] No, Peter, brother B would say like
[1:17:04] this. Peter said, "I fished with them
[1:17:06] out pulling in the fish and I've done
[1:17:08] these different things. I seen him heal
[1:17:09] the sick. He kept telling me the father
[1:17:12] that's in me, but when I leave, he's
[1:17:14] going to come into you. So, I couldn't
[1:17:16] understand that, and none of us can
[1:17:18] either. Notice, but he said, now he
[1:17:21] goes, I don't expect you to understand
[1:17:22] it. I He goes, "You don't understand
[1:17:24] these things. You just get them. I don't
[1:17:27] understand it yet." And and and he told
[1:17:29] me that he would do it because you
[1:17:31] don't. He says, he goes, "No." He said,
[1:17:33] "I can't understand it. I can't explain
[1:17:35] them. But the only thing is I got it."
[1:17:38] Yeah. A lot of times we try to
[1:17:40] rationalize. We try to figure it out.
[1:17:42] Some of us are great intellectual
[1:17:43] thinkers. Thank God I'm not. I just like
[1:17:46] to be simple and dumb. Dumb enough to be
[1:17:49] simple but smart enough to believe. But
[1:17:52] nevertheless, he couldn't understand it.
[1:17:54] I can't explain it. But the only thing I
[1:17:56] know is I got it.
[1:17:59] See, there are things that God does that
[1:18:01] we will never understand.
[1:18:03] There is things that God does that we
[1:18:05] will never be able to explain. never to
[1:18:07] know. Nevertheless, God knows what he's
[1:18:10] doing. His ways are perfect. And if his
[1:18:12] ways are perfect, he is perfect. His His
[1:18:15] word is perfect, his timing is perfect,
[1:18:18] therefore his outcomes are perfect.
[1:18:21] Oh, hallelujah. You can't go wrong by
[1:18:24] trusting in this God.
[1:18:27] So, I can't understand it. I can't
[1:18:28] explain it. But the only thing I know is
[1:18:31] I got it.
[1:18:33] He say, "Brother Joe, do you know the
[1:18:35] hour, the minute, the second that you
[1:18:38] got the Holy Ghost?" Uh-uh. But I got
[1:18:40] it.
[1:18:42] Many times I rack my brain around the
[1:18:44] night I gave my heart to the Lord. I
[1:18:46] can't remember the date, but I can
[1:18:48] remember that night. And I can tell you
[1:18:49] I got it. You know, Brother Bam tells a
[1:18:52] story about Benjamin Franklin. He said,
[1:18:54] "There was a man one time. He began to
[1:18:56] see lightning flash and thought, well,
[1:18:58] there's something to that. There's a
[1:19:00] power there. Notice we're preaching on
[1:19:04] power restored to the church.
[1:19:08] And he he noticed there was a flash in
[1:19:10] the skies and he said there's a power
[1:19:12] there and he took a key and he put it on
[1:19:14] a kite tail flying it around and he
[1:19:17] caught he said he caught the electric
[1:19:19] come down and the wire hit the bottle
[1:19:21] and he caught the electricity and he
[1:19:23] began to scream I got it. I got it. But
[1:19:27] he didn't know what he had.
[1:19:31] And brother Bam said, "That's like a lot
[1:19:32] of us in church.
[1:19:35] We got it. We got it." And we don't
[1:19:36] really know what we got.
[1:19:40] He didn't know what he had. But I think
[1:19:42] that he said, "Maybe it's just like a
[1:19:44] whole lot of us when we find Christ, we
[1:19:46] sing and and and know I got it. I got
[1:19:48] it." That's about as much as we know
[1:19:49] about it. But notice there come Thomas
[1:19:52] Edison. There comes somebody that could
[1:19:56] recognize if if that has enough power
[1:19:58] there to create light and Abra I mean
[1:20:01] and Benjamin Franklin has it. And he
[1:20:04] goes and I got it. He goes and I want
[1:20:07] the benefits of it. A lot of things we
[1:20:10] got it. We got it. We got it. But yet
[1:20:12] what about the benefits of having it?
[1:20:14] What about the benefits about being a
[1:20:17] son and daughter of God? Didn't David
[1:20:19] say in the Psalms, "He daily loadeth me
[1:20:22] with benefits." And sometimes we walk
[1:20:25] around dragging in the house of God and
[1:20:27] so overwhelmed by this and so
[1:20:29] overwhelmed by that. But what about the
[1:20:31] benefits? We got it. Can I tell you this
[1:20:34] morning, we got the same power. We got
[1:20:36] the same anointing and we got the
[1:20:39] benefits of being a child of God. We got
[1:20:41] the rewards of being a daughter of God.
[1:20:44] That's right. We don't have to go down
[1:20:47] in defeat. We got it, church. And we
[1:20:49] know what we got.
[1:20:52] It's one thing to scream and shout, "I
[1:20:54] got it. I got it." And walk out of here
[1:20:56] defeated. But to scream and shout and
[1:20:58] know that you got it. Know that you met
[1:21:00] him. Know that he came down. Know that
[1:21:02] he filled you. And you know what you got
[1:21:04] this morning. And it's a lifesaving
[1:21:08] power. I got it this morning. What do
[1:21:11] you got? I got the same power, the same
[1:21:14] anointing, the same Holy Ghost that was
[1:21:17] promised on that day.
[1:21:22] I got it.
[1:21:28] You may like, man, Brother Joe, if
[1:21:30] that's what you got, I don't want it.
[1:21:35] I tell
[1:21:36] you, I got it. Amen. Power restored back
[1:21:41] to the church. It may not make you act
[1:21:44] like
[1:21:46] me, but you're going to act the way God
[1:21:48] intended for you to act.
[1:21:51] Some of you may be so overwhelmed with
[1:21:53] emotion that you just begin to cry.
[1:21:57] Some of you may just stand up and shout.
[1:22:01] Some of you just may begin to run about.
[1:22:03] I was at a church when I left here. I
[1:22:05] went to North Carolina and I preached
[1:22:07] the first part of this at that church.
[1:22:09] And at the end of the service, some
[1:22:10] young man got up under the anointing of
[1:22:13] the Holy Spirit and ran around the
[1:22:14] entire church a couple times. Why?
[1:22:16] Because he had it. It was no longer just
[1:22:20] words on the page. It was no longer just
[1:22:22] a preacher's mentality. He had it. He
[1:22:25] received it. And it so overtook him.
[1:22:33] And Thomas Edison, he worked tirelessly
[1:22:36] night after night, wire after wire.
[1:22:40] He didn't get discouraged when he
[1:22:42] failed.
[1:22:45] Come on.
[1:22:46] He didn't get discoura. Hey Gideon, how
[1:22:48] you doing, my friend? I expect to see
[1:22:51] you on the front row. What are you
[1:22:52] doing? You done got backsliding on
[1:22:54] me? My my
[1:22:56] my. That's my buddy right there.
[1:23:00] But he tried this wire, it didn't work.
[1:23:03] This wire, it didn't work. This wire,
[1:23:06] different gauge, different conduit,
[1:23:08] different types. You know, he didn't get
[1:23:10] discouraged. And many times, you know,
[1:23:12] you try this and and you try that, it
[1:23:14] seems like this is not creating the
[1:23:16] right kind of current. This is not but
[1:23:18] you know, it's not lighting up the the
[1:23:20] incandescent in the bulb. But brother
[1:23:22] Ram said there was something inside of
[1:23:24] Edison's heart. He knew if he saw it
[1:23:26] light up there, then it could light down
[1:23:28] here. And what am I telling you Lord? If
[1:23:30] the word could work back in that day,
[1:23:32] it's got to work again in this day.
[1:23:34] Because it's the same power that's in
[1:23:36] the skies is now living in men and women
[1:23:39] and sons and daughters of God. It's the
[1:23:41] same anointing. Don't leave it in the
[1:23:44] skies. God sent you a prophet that went
[1:23:46] up there and brought it down and said,
[1:23:48] "Now I can live in the people. Power
[1:23:51] restored back to the church.
[1:23:54] an anointing to give you overcoming
[1:23:57] victory.
[1:24:02] He believed with all his
[1:24:04] heart. Therefore, he kept working.
[1:24:07] Therefore, he kept praying. Some of you
[1:24:09] have put those
[1:24:11] children. He gave them to the to the
[1:24:13] Lord at the at the altar as a little
[1:24:16] kid, little infant, dedicated them to
[1:24:18] God. They grow up. They break your
[1:24:20] heart.
[1:24:22] They'll
[1:24:23] stray. They'll do things. They'll tat
[1:24:25] theirel up, get theirelves all twisted
[1:24:28] in
[1:24:31] drugs. That one didn't work. That one
[1:24:34] didn't work. That one didn't work. But
[1:24:37] he kept praying. He kept believing cuz
[1:24:40] there was something inside of him. Said,
[1:24:42] "No matter how I feel, no matter what, I
[1:24:45] know that what Benjamin Franklin got a
[1:24:47] hold of, if it lit it up there, it can
[1:24:49] light it down here." What am I telling
[1:24:50] you? I'm telling you, you don't give up
[1:24:52] on your children. You don't give up on
[1:24:53] your sons. You don't give up on your
[1:24:55] daughters. You don't give up on those
[1:24:56] things. Why? Because if there's a deep
[1:24:58] calling, there's a deep going to respond
[1:25:00] to it. All you got to do is keep
[1:25:02] trusting. Keep praying. Keep believing.
[1:25:04] Say, "God, I know. I don't know when. I
[1:25:07] don't know how, but something inside of
[1:25:08] them is calling out. It's got to happen.
[1:25:10] It's got to light up because your word
[1:25:12] declares it."
[1:25:17] Notice, see, he
[1:25:20] believed with his cup of coffee and a
[1:25:22] sandwich, he worked all night. If one
[1:25:24] wire didn't work, he wasn't discouraged.
[1:25:28] Many times we get discouraged though.
[1:25:31] How many of you have ever been
[1:25:32] discouraged?
[1:25:33] Only about three or four of y'all, huh?
[1:25:35] Hallelujah. Man, you your preaching is
[1:25:38] better than we expected.
[1:25:44] You know, but we as Christians, things
[1:25:45] don't seem to go our way. We get
[1:25:48] discouraged.
[1:25:50] Come on. Even preachers get discouraged.
[1:25:53] All right. We get discouraged. And you
[1:25:56] know, and we just begin to wonder. We
[1:25:58] begin to question. We begin to ponder.
[1:26:01] How many of you familiar with Corey
[1:26:02] Tinboom?
[1:26:04] She said, "If you look at the world,
[1:26:06] you'll be
[1:26:07] distressed. If you look within, you'll
[1:26:10] be depressed. But if you look to God,
[1:26:13] you'll be at rest.
[1:26:16] You look at the world today, there's no
[1:26:18] satisfaction in the world today. There's
[1:26:20] no joy. There's no peace in the world
[1:26:23] today. And and if you look within, my my
[1:26:25] my if you look within, you'll see your
[1:26:27] imperfections.
[1:26:29] You'll be, you know, you question, how
[1:26:31] can it be? Why did he choose me? Or am I
[1:26:34] even chosen?
[1:26:36] I mean, the thoughts, the battle that
[1:26:37] runs through our minds as humans,
[1:26:40] especially in those low and weak moments
[1:26:42] that we go through. But she said, "If
[1:26:44] you look to God, you'll be at rest." But
[1:26:47] see, that's what we got to do is turn
[1:26:49] our eyes off of ourselves. Turn our eyes
[1:26:51] off of the world. Let me just say, turn
[1:26:53] your eyes off other churches,
[1:26:56] what God is doing in other churches, and
[1:26:58] turn your eyes to him.
[1:27:01] Notice we one of the great reminders
[1:27:04] that we have is to look to Jesus and
[1:27:07] live. You know, you're going to find
[1:27:09] peace, it's going to be in Jesus. You're
[1:27:12] going to find rest, it's going to be in
[1:27:14] Jesus. You're going to, you know, you
[1:27:15] want to be sheltered in his arms of
[1:27:17] mercy and grace. It's not going to be in
[1:27:19] some organization. It's not going to be
[1:27:21] in some man's idea. It's not going to be
[1:27:23] in some dogma, something handed down
[1:27:25] through traditions. But the only way we
[1:27:27] find those things is to find Jesus. And
[1:27:30] you look in the Bible and he would tell
[1:27:32] them in the Old Testament when they were
[1:27:33] bitten by a brazen serpent, he said,
[1:27:35] "Look to the serpent." The brazen
[1:27:37] serpent, "Look to that serpent and if
[1:27:39] you look to it, you'll live." And I'm
[1:27:41] here to tell you what was that
[1:27:42] representing sin already judged. And in
[1:27:44] the New Testament, he said, "Look to
[1:27:46] Jesus." Why? Because he was the
[1:27:48] atonement for sin. And in this day,
[1:27:51] church, we're not looking to a brazen
[1:27:52] serpent, but we're looking back to the
[1:27:54] word of God. looking back to the promise
[1:27:57] of God, looking back to Jesus Christ,
[1:27:59] the author and the finisher of our
[1:28:01] faith. Look to him this morning and live
[1:28:11] Hallelujah.
[1:28:13] Now, let me ask you a question. How many
[1:28:14] of you have ever worried?
[1:28:18] Oh, that was
[1:28:23] Nobody's doing this, are they?
[1:28:29] Maybe just a just a little. We
[1:28:33] all I'm gonna say it again. How many of
[1:28:35] you have ever
[1:28:37] worried? There we go. Class
[1:28:41] participation. You're supposed to be the
[1:28:43] preacher. Would you just preach and
[1:28:44] leave us out?
[1:28:47] We all have worried at some point.
[1:28:50] We have all have worried and in the we
[1:28:53] hours of the night wrestle it out. Kind
[1:28:57] of like Jacob wrestling with that angel
[1:29:00] trying to figure it out and make this
[1:29:02] work here. And if I could just do this,
[1:29:04] it'll happen. If I do this, it'll
[1:29:06] happen. It'll never work the way you
[1:29:08] think it in your mind.
[1:29:10] And all your working ain't going to
[1:29:13] change a thing.
[1:29:15] And if your nature likes some of us that
[1:29:17] are super compulsive about certain
[1:29:18] things and want everything to be
[1:29:20] perfect, you'll be disappointed. And
[1:29:24] Corey Tinboom, I'll tell you what she
[1:29:25] quoted about worry. She says, "Worrying
[1:29:28] is carrying tomorrow's load with today's
[1:29:31] strength." So say that again, Brother
[1:29:33] Joe. Thank you. I will. Worrying is
[1:29:36] carrying tomorrow's load with today's
[1:29:39] strength. Amen. Sing carrying two days
[1:29:42] at once. It's moving into tomorrow ahead
[1:29:45] of time. Worrying doesn't empty tomorrow
[1:29:48] of its sorrows. It empties today of its
[1:29:51] strength. Worrying doesn't empty
[1:29:54] tomorrow of its sorrows. Listen to me,
[1:29:57] church. It empties
[1:29:59] today of its strength. And the Bible
[1:30:02] says, "This is the day that the Lord
[1:30:04] hath made." Amen. I'm going to rejoice
[1:30:07] and be glad in this day.
[1:30:10] Tomorrow is tomorrow.
[1:30:14] And we find in Matthew 6, it says,
[1:30:16] "Therefore say unto you, take no thought
[1:30:19] for your life. What you shall eat, or
[1:30:21] what you shall drink, nor yet for your
[1:30:23] body, what you shall put on is not the
[1:30:25] life more than meat and the body than
[1:30:27] raignment. Behold the fowls of the air,
[1:30:30] for they sow not, neither do they reap,
[1:30:32] neither do they gather in barns. Yet
[1:30:34] your heavenly father feedth them. Are
[1:30:36] you not much better than
[1:30:38] they? Which of you? My my my I wish I
[1:30:42] could do
[1:30:43] this. Tommy, I know you're right there
[1:30:46] with me. Say amen. I'm gonna finish
[1:30:50] this. You better know the rest of this
[1:30:51] scripture. Which of you by taking any
[1:30:54] thought can add one cubic to his
[1:30:59] stature? Some of y'all laughing.
[1:31:02] Little uh y'all little be quiet
[1:31:07] now. I'm going to be quiet. I'm going to
[1:31:09] be good this morning. I ain't going to
[1:31:11] say nothing cuz I remember the first
[1:31:12] time I came I said something. I ain't
[1:31:14] they ain't let me live that down
[1:31:18] yet. But none of us I mean hey man since
[1:31:21] I was a kid I wanted to be six foot tall
[1:31:23] and bulletproof.
[1:31:25] Well, I'm 5 foot five and I had to I
[1:31:29] shrunk an inch and a half in the last
[1:31:30] few
[1:31:31] years. But we can't add anything to our
[1:31:35] stature,
[1:31:36] but yet we make so much up in our minds.
[1:31:39] If I could do this and if I was this, if
[1:31:42] I was, you know, I used to tell myself
[1:31:44] when I was come out of high school, I'm
[1:31:45] trying to I try out for a college
[1:31:47] football team and I had bigger heart
[1:31:49] than anybody on the team that I played
[1:31:50] with, but I was the littlest man on the
[1:31:52] front line. I'm like, man, if I just had
[1:31:55] the size, I'd be man, I'd be ruthless on
[1:31:58] that front line. I'd be a bulldog,
[1:32:00] brother Tommy. But you know what? You're
[1:32:02] stuck with 5'6 at the time. 5'6 and a
[1:32:05] half. You don't get much off the front
[1:32:06] line at 5'6 and a half. But we find here
[1:32:09] what he says in Matthew 6. Why take you
[1:32:12] thought for your raignment? Consider the
[1:32:13] liies of the field, how they grow. They
[1:32:15] tore not, neither do they spin. And yet
[1:32:17] I say unto you that even Solomon all of
[1:32:19] his glory was not a raid like one of
[1:32:21] these. Wherefore if God so clothe the
[1:32:24] grass of the field which is today and
[1:32:26] tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he
[1:32:28] not much more clothe you and you of oh
[1:32:30] you a little faith. Therefore take no
[1:32:33] thought saying what shall we eat or what
[1:32:35] shall we drink or whether all shall we
[1:32:37] be clothed? See for your heavenly father
[1:32:39] knoweth that which we have need of. And
[1:32:41] he says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:32:43] God and his righteousness and all these
[1:32:46] things will be added unto you.
[1:32:49] Take therefore no thought for tomorrow.
[1:32:52] Here it is. I'm tying that quote in or
[1:32:54] that quote from Corey Tenboom. Take no
[1:32:56] thought for tomorrow. For tomorrow shall
[1:32:58] take thought for the things of itself.
[1:33:02] Sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:33:04] there. We have enough to contend with
[1:33:06] today to be worrying about tomorrow's
[1:33:09] load and tomorrow's guilt and tomorrow's
[1:33:12] cares and tomorrow's affairs. Let's deal
[1:33:14] with today while we have today. So
[1:33:17] worrying is like carrying tomorrow's
[1:33:20] load with today's
[1:33:21] strength. Let's just leave that
[1:33:24] alone. Brother asked brother Brandon one
[1:33:26] time or he was telling a story about a a
[1:33:28] colored brother there and he said I I
[1:33:30] believe a Bible and and he was you know
[1:33:33] toting it to work and he couldn't read
[1:33:34] brother Thomas and his boss and he said
[1:33:36] now John he goes why are you toing that
[1:33:38] Bible? You can't read. He said because I
[1:33:40] believe it.
[1:33:42] Eyes believe it. Some of us need to say
[1:33:44] that this morning I believe it.
[1:33:47] But you can't read. That's all right. I
[1:33:49] believe it. I believe it from kiver to
[1:33:51] kiver. And I believe the giver, too. No.
[1:33:54] Sometimes it'll do us good to tell the
[1:33:55] devil, I believe it from giver to giver.
[1:33:58] And I believe the kiver, too. He said,
[1:34:00] oh. He says, then more than that, boss.
[1:34:02] He says, I'm going to stand on this
[1:34:04] Bible. He says, because if I stand on
[1:34:06] this Bible, it's better than standing in
[1:34:08] heaven. He said, what do you mean, John?
[1:34:10] It's better than standing in heaven. He
[1:34:12] says, "Because heavens and earth will
[1:34:13] pass away, but my word will not pass
[1:34:16] away and I'm standing on the word. And
[1:34:18] when you're standing on the word,
[1:34:20] church, heavens and earth can come. Hell
[1:34:22] can come against you. But you're
[1:34:24] standing on the rock. You're standing on
[1:34:26] the promise. You're standing on the
[1:34:28] word. And there's power in the word.
[1:34:31] There's power in the blood of Jesus
[1:34:33] Christ.
[1:34:35] Lord, Lord,
[1:34:37] there's power, restored power. This
[1:34:40] ain't just something from history books,
[1:34:43] some history lesson.
[1:34:47] No. If it's a history lesson, throw the
[1:34:49] thing in the garbage. But this is not a
[1:34:51] history lesson. He's a present tense
[1:34:53] God. He's a present tense Jesus.
[1:34:57] He has what you have need of this
[1:34:59] morning.
[1:35:04] Cory Chin Boon would make another quote.
[1:35:05] She said, "When a train go throughs a
[1:35:07] goes through a tunnel and it gets
[1:35:11] dark, you don't throw away the ticket
[1:35:14] and jump
[1:35:16] off." You don't throw away the ticket
[1:35:18] and jump off. You sit still and trust
[1:35:21] the engineer.
[1:35:24] When a train goes through a tunnel,
[1:35:26] Brother Joe, and it gets dark. How many
[1:35:29] of you ever been on a train ride? My, it
[1:35:32] gets dark. All the lights go out and all
[1:35:34] you
[1:35:37] You don't throw the ticket away and jump
[1:35:40] off the train. No, you sit there
[1:35:43] believing we're coming out of this
[1:35:45] tunnel. We're coming out of this
[1:35:47] darkness. There's going to be light at
[1:35:49] the end of this thing.
[1:35:51] And there are many times in our lives
[1:35:53] that we enter into dark
[1:35:55] tunnels. There's many times we get into
[1:35:58] difficult trials and maybe we question,
[1:36:01] why am I here? How did I get here? What
[1:36:06] did I do to deserve this?
[1:36:10] Ain't none of y'all ever said that in
[1:36:11] Kentucky. Have
[1:36:13] you see Job? Think about the story of
[1:36:17] Job. And I think I mentioned to you last
[1:36:18] time I was here as I just read the story
[1:36:20] of Job all the way through. And you
[1:36:22] know, Job didn't do anything to deserve
[1:36:24] what the Lord allowed him to go through.
[1:36:26] But notice the conversation that the
[1:36:29] Lord had, God had with Satan, his
[1:36:32] archeneemy. Have you considered my
[1:36:35] servant Job? Notice he didn't say, "Have
[1:36:38] you considered Job?"
[1:36:41] He was stating a claim. Staking a claim
[1:36:43] that he's my servant. Job belongs to me,
[1:36:46] Satan. And what am I telling you this
[1:36:49] morning? Bride of Jesus Christ. You may
[1:36:51] be under attack. You may be going
[1:36:52] through a lot. But I want you to know
[1:36:54] your heavenly father has already said,
[1:36:56] "Have you considered my bride that there
[1:36:58] ain't a bride like her in all the land?
[1:37:00] That she'll not defect from my word?
[1:37:03] She'll trust me. She'll believe for me.
[1:37:05] Though I put sickness on her, though you
[1:37:07] put this on her, she's not going to
[1:37:08] curse me. She's not going to deny me.
[1:37:10] She's going to stand on my word.
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:18] Notice God put a claim on Job that he
[1:37:21] was his servant. And God had confidence
[1:37:24] in Job. He had confidence in Job's
[1:37:27] experience.
[1:37:29] And God has confidence in you this
[1:37:31] morning.
[1:37:33] Brother Joe, when you went through that
[1:37:35] dark season, God had confidence in what
[1:37:38] he put on the inside.
[1:37:42] Come on, church. A lot of times we look
[1:37:43] on the outside and say, "Well, you know
[1:37:45] what? Ain't no way. There ain't no way.
[1:37:47] They must have done this. They must have
[1:37:48] done that." But what you can't see, what
[1:37:50] God sees. He sees the seed that he
[1:37:52] placed on the inside. And he knows just
[1:37:55] like that train, if it's got to get to
[1:37:57] its destination, there's going to be
[1:37:59] some dark tunnels. There's going to be
[1:38:01] some low valleys. There's going to be
[1:38:02] some high mountain tops. But ain't
[1:38:04] nothing going to stop that train cuz
[1:38:06] it's going to arrive at its destination.
[1:38:08] And what am I telling you? If you a true
[1:38:10] born again son and daughter of God, he
[1:38:13] placed a predestinated CG on the inside.
[1:38:16] And there ain't enough devils, there
[1:38:18] ain't enough hardships, there ain't
[1:38:20] enough trials that can stop that because
[1:38:22] power has been restored back to you this
[1:38:24] morning. And it energizes that seed and
[1:38:27] it brings that seed to life.
[1:38:34] When it gets dark, Brother Tommy, hold
[1:38:36] that. Hold that ticket.
[1:38:40] When it gets challenging, Brother
[1:38:41] Thomas, hold that ticket.
[1:38:44] When life gets difficult, come on,
[1:38:46] somebody hold that ticket in your hand.
[1:38:50] When the nights get long and the days
[1:38:52] get dark and weary and you wonder, "How
[1:38:54] am I going to make it? Why are we going
[1:38:55] through this? Why are we going through
[1:38:57] that?" Can I tell you? Hold that ticket
[1:38:59] in your hand. You got the token this
[1:39:01] morning. There's churches out there and
[1:39:03] the prophet of God said there's been
[1:39:04] churches, churches and brides, bride,
[1:39:07] but there must come one. And can I tell
[1:39:09] you this morning, you are that one. You
[1:39:12] are that bride. You are that chosen. You
[1:39:14] are that
[1:39:17] elect. Power has been restored to you.
[1:39:25] That train will not stop until it
[1:39:28] reaches its destination.
[1:39:33] Hallelujah. I thank God for that.
[1:39:36] There's times you want to stop. Ain't no
[1:39:39] jumping off, brother Troy. Stay on.
[1:39:41] Buckle up. Hold the ticket in your hand.
[1:39:45] There's no tunnel too
[1:39:48] dark. There's no valley too deep. But
[1:39:51] what God's hand is deeper still. There's
[1:39:54] no mountain top too high. They say, "Oh,
[1:39:57] you'll never get there. Oh, that's not
[1:39:58] for you. Oh, that's for the days of
[1:40:00] miracles has passed." You can't have
[1:40:02] that. Hogwash.
[1:40:05] That's a Kentucky term, Louisiana term,
[1:40:07] Mississippi term.
[1:40:09] Hogwash. Otherwise, you can take that
[1:40:12] lie and go to hell with it because we're
[1:40:14] believing for the impossible this
[1:40:15] morning. Don't you tell me we can't have
[1:40:18] it because I'm standing on the word and
[1:40:20] the word says it's already mine. It's
[1:40:22] already declared you the victor this
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:28] morning. We look here in Psalms 30 and
[1:40:30] verse 5.
[1:40:37] Bible says weeping may endure for the
[1:40:41] night. But joy,
[1:40:44] joy cometh in the morning.
[1:40:48] Now, we've had our
[1:40:50] nights, Brother Caleb. We've had our
[1:40:52] nights of weeping.
[1:40:55] We wet our pillows with tears of
[1:40:58] sorrow. But joy cometh in the morning.
[1:41:01] That's right. And if I can turn you this
[1:41:04] morning just to to idea the revelation
[1:41:06] that I am a son of God, that I am a
[1:41:09] daughter of God, all the tears that have
[1:41:12] been streaming down your face worrying
[1:41:14] about things you have no control over
[1:41:16] will dry up in an instant.
[1:41:19] When you recognize your position in the
[1:41:22] body, it's it's paramount that we
[1:41:24] understand who we are in this hour.
[1:41:29] We can hear some of the greatest
[1:41:30] preaching and it go right over our head
[1:41:33] from some of the greatest ministries and
[1:41:35] it go right over our head. But if you
[1:41:37] can ever catch that revelation that I
[1:41:41] am that I am. Come on church. That I am
[1:41:46] not my neighbor but I am this morning.
[1:41:49] Not I was or I may be but I am a child
[1:41:53] of God. I'm no longer a servant to sin.
[1:41:56] I'm no longer a servant to drugs. I'm no
[1:41:59] longer a servant to sex tins. No, I'm a
[1:42:01] child of God. He had made me a son and I
[1:42:04] am a joint heir with him. Everything
[1:42:06] that Christ has, I have. Everything that
[1:42:09] belongs him, it belongs to me. Why?
[1:42:11] Because I am a joint heir with him. I'm
[1:42:13] a child of God this morning. I'm a son
[1:42:16] of God this morning. And he put the word
[1:42:18] in my
[1:42:19] heart. Power has been restored to the
[1:42:21] body. Power has been restored to the
[1:42:23] church. And guess what it does? It
[1:42:25] stimulates you.
[1:42:29] Stimulation from revelation when you
[1:42:31] understand that's who I am. I never was
[1:42:34] a pig. I never was a hog. I never don't
[1:42:37] belong down there. I never was a
[1:42:39] chicken. I always was an eagle. I always
[1:42:42] was a child of God.
[1:42:50] Philippians 4:6 says, "Be careful for
[1:42:53] nothing.
[1:42:55] But in
[1:42:56] everything by
[1:42:58] prayer. Don't come halfcock, but
[1:43:02] pray and your supplication. Notice what
[1:43:04] it says now. Everything by prayer and
[1:43:06] supplication with thanksgiving.
[1:43:09] Otherwise, start thanking the Lord
[1:43:11] before it happens.
[1:43:14] A lot of times it's okay. We make
[1:43:15] prayer, but we ain't making any any
[1:43:17] thanksgiving on behalf of it. We
[1:43:20] waiting. Waiting to see. Waiting to see.
[1:43:23] waiting to see will it will the word
[1:43:25] take effect. What did Mary say? Be it
[1:43:28] unto me, Lord, according to thy word.
[1:43:31] She had to believe for the impossible.
[1:43:34] Never had it been done before. But I ask
[1:43:37] you, did it happen?
[1:43:40] Come on, Mary. Be it unto me this
[1:43:43] morning. Yeah. Lord. Notice, be careful
[1:43:46] for nothing, but in everything by prayer
[1:43:48] and supplication with thanksgiving, let
[1:43:50] your requests be made known to God. And
[1:43:53] the peace of God which passes all
[1:43:55] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:43:58] your minds through Christ Jesus. And 1
[1:44:01] Peter 5:7 says, "Cast all your cares."
[1:44:07] All your cares. If your family cares,
[1:44:10] your children
[1:44:12] cares, your marriage cares, your job
[1:44:15] cares, your financial cares. Come on.
[1:44:19] Otherwise, all your worries.
[1:44:22] Let's take that word care there and put
[1:44:23] it as worries and frets and stresses and
[1:44:26] difficulties and trials. Cast it all
[1:44:28] upon him
[1:44:30] because why? Because he hates you. Cuz
[1:44:34] he despises you. Because you're not good
[1:44:36] enough. you'll never be good enough. It
[1:44:39] ain't based on how good we are. It's
[1:44:41] based on what he's already done for us.
[1:44:44] But he says, "Cast all your cares upon
[1:44:46] him. For he cares for you this morning."
[1:44:49] And if you can get that revelation in
[1:44:51] your mind, no matter what you're going
[1:44:52] through, God cares for me this morning.
[1:44:54] He not seen the righteous forsaken, nor
[1:44:56] his seed beggar for bread, but God has
[1:44:59] always been there. He's watched over
[1:45:01] that seed down through generations. And
[1:45:03] he brought this one with that one and
[1:45:04] that one with that one to bring you here
[1:45:07] this morning.
[1:45:13] Let me give you another quote from Corey
[1:45:15] Tinboon. I'm not preaching Corey Tinboon
[1:45:17] message this morning, but I sure love
[1:45:19] her
[1:45:20] quotes. She said, "In order to realize
[1:45:24] the worth of the
[1:45:26] anchor, you need to feel the stress of
[1:45:29] the storm."
[1:45:30] And I'm going to put it in Mississippi
[1:45:32] Joe Adams
[1:45:34] terminology. In order to feel the
[1:45:36] strength of the anchor, you need to feel
[1:45:39] the power of the storm.
[1:45:43] Because the anchor is only as strong as
[1:45:46] its weakest link.
[1:45:50] Man, can I tell you this morning that
[1:45:53] that anchor holds?
[1:45:55] There's been times, many of you, you
[1:45:57] wanted to quit. You wanted to walk away
[1:46:00] from it, but that anchor is holding. No
[1:46:04] matter how strong that storm is, no
[1:46:06] matter how prevailing the winds are.
[1:46:08] Look, we have seen storms just come
[1:46:09] through these last couple days. I was in
[1:46:11] that little tin trailer. Thought, man,
[1:46:12] I'm going to be Mary Poppins. We about
[1:46:13] to fly up out of here. The trees were
[1:46:16] bending sideways. Brother Joe, I was
[1:46:18] praying, Lord, I didn't think I was
[1:46:19] going to go this way, but I'm
[1:46:22] ready. But in order to feel the strength
[1:46:25] of the anchor, how strong is it? How
[1:46:28] sure is it? You must feel the power of
[1:46:30] the gale, the power of the storm. And
[1:46:32] can I tell you this morning that the
[1:46:34] anchor's holding when you wanted to
[1:46:36] quit, the anchor holds. When you want to
[1:46:38] walk away, the anchor's holding. When
[1:46:39] you didn't think you can be healed, the
[1:46:41] anchor's holding. When you felt like
[1:46:43] giving up and being defeated, that
[1:46:45] anchor's holding you this morning. No
[1:46:47] matter the storm, no matter the winds,
[1:46:49] no matter how much you've gone through,
[1:46:52] no matter the hell that beats down, the
[1:46:54] anchor holds this morning. It's hold you
[1:46:56] in the palm of his hand.
[1:47:01] The
[1:47:02] anchor holds. He'll never understand the
[1:47:07] worth of the anchor. The worth, how much
[1:47:11] it means to you until you felt the
[1:47:14] stress of the storm, the power, the
[1:47:16] force, the energy behind that assault.
[1:47:21] And she says again, "You'll never learn
[1:47:24] that Christ is all you need until Christ
[1:47:28] is all you
[1:47:32] have." Many of you are familiar with my
[1:47:34] testimony and maybe sometime I'll give
[1:47:37] you a full full outlay of my testimony,
[1:47:39] not just that little clip of it. But
[1:47:42] see, Corey
[1:47:44] Tinboon, my my my time just gets away.
[1:47:48] Corey Tinboon and her family were
[1:47:50] captured by the Nazi regime for
[1:47:54] supporting and helping the
[1:47:57] Jews. Her father was a a watchmaker. She
[1:48:00] was a watchmaker. And and so they hid
[1:48:02] all these Jews in a hiding place, little
[1:48:05] secret room behind a bedroom. And they
[1:48:09] was ratted on by one of their neighbors.
[1:48:11] And they come and they captured Corey
[1:48:13] and her family. And they took him to the
[1:48:15] concentration camp. And while she was in
[1:48:17] this camp before, when they captured
[1:48:19] her, she was sick. She had I don't know
[1:48:21] what she had, maybe typhford, some kind
[1:48:22] of sickness that she had. Well, they
[1:48:24] kept her in an isolation for like six to
[1:48:27] nine months, solitary confinement,
[1:48:31] little window, only let a little bit of
[1:48:34] light
[1:48:35] in. The only friend she had, Brother
[1:48:37] Thomas, was a little mouse that would
[1:48:40] come out and play and nibble, and she
[1:48:42] would give it some crumbs from the
[1:48:43] crackers that she would eat. And there
[1:48:46] from there she would pin this quote. You
[1:48:48] will never know that Christ is all you
[1:48:52] need until Christ is all you
[1:48:56] have. When everything is stripped
[1:48:59] away, seems like everything's failing.
[1:49:01] Everything you touch, it's not turning
[1:49:03] to gold, but it's turning to
[1:49:06] mold.
[1:49:08] Christ is all you need.
[1:49:11] Brother Glenn, when you've been in your
[1:49:13] lowest moment, your darkest hour, you'll
[1:49:17] never know that he's all you need until
[1:49:19] he's all that you have.
[1:49:22] And I want to tell you, church, ministry
[1:49:24] will disappoint you. Not intentionally.
[1:49:28] We're just man, we're not
[1:49:30] perfect. Your friends, your neighbors,
[1:49:32] your loved ones, they will hurt you.
[1:49:35] Some will do it intentionally. Some will
[1:49:37] do it in unintentionally.
[1:49:41] But this relationship that we have, this
[1:49:43] walk that we have is not with us and our
[1:49:46] neighbor, us and our spouse, us and our
[1:49:48] children. It's us and God.
[1:49:51] And you will never know that he's all
[1:49:53] you need until everything else is
[1:49:56] stripped away and he's all you have.
[1:49:59] when you're in those wee hours of the
[1:50:01] night pondering how you going to make
[1:50:03] it, how you going to pay the bill, how
[1:50:05] you going to do this, and how and how
[1:50:06] and how, and you just come to that
[1:50:08] essence and that that that final anchor.
[1:50:11] He's all I have. And that's what he
[1:50:14] brought this message to us for in this
[1:50:17] hour. Because man had failed down
[1:50:20] through
[1:50:20] generations. Systems of man had failed
[1:50:23] down through generations.
[1:50:25] And this that we have today is not
[1:50:27] contingent on any one
[1:50:29] man. Let me say that and I want to be
[1:50:31] clear. What we have today yet it took a
[1:50:34] prophet to bring us the clarity of the
[1:50:36] word. Don't ever forget that we have to
[1:50:39] have that. The Bible speaks of a Malachi
[1:50:41] 4. The Bible speaks of a Luke 17. The
[1:50:44] Bible speaks of a Revelations 10:7. The
[1:50:46] Bible speaks of these things. But the
[1:50:48] experience that we have does not re
[1:50:50] revolve around any one man ministry.
[1:50:54] So otherwise, no pastor can place you in
[1:50:57] it and no pastor can take you out of it.
[1:51:01] And you'll never know that Christ is all
[1:51:03] you need, young people, until he's all
[1:51:05] you have. You go to a camp meeting, go
[1:51:09] expecting to meet Christ.
[1:51:12] You go to school, go expecting to show
[1:51:14] people Christ. When you go out there in
[1:51:16] the Walmart, I don't have very many of
[1:51:18] them around
[1:51:19] here. Don't go to Meth County. Good Lord
[1:51:22] have mercy. I told y'all where I was at
[1:51:23] last time. Yeah, we ain't going to go
[1:51:25] there again. But look, take Jesus Christ
[1:51:27] with you. Maybe we can get some teeth
[1:51:29] back in their mouth.
[1:51:33] But we find many times we are we're
[1:51:36] afraid to display
[1:51:39] Jesus. But if he's all you have, you
[1:51:41] can't help but to display Jesus.
[1:51:44] So, we're preaching this morning. I'm
[1:51:46] going to hurry up and try to bring this
[1:51:47] down because we got about another 20
[1:51:48] minutes here. But many times, God allows
[1:51:50] us to get to places that we don't
[1:51:51] understand how we got here. Why am I
[1:51:55] here? What did I do to deserve this? You
[1:51:58] didn't do anything. It's part of the
[1:52:00] journey.
[1:52:02] It's part of the
[1:52:04] molding. There's things that you go
[1:52:06] through down here that God's going to
[1:52:08] use you at a different stage of life.
[1:52:11] things that you face as a child or maybe
[1:52:13] things you come through as a a young
[1:52:15] adult or a young married couple, things
[1:52:16] you go through in, you know, those
[1:52:18] hardships that you face in a young
[1:52:20] marriage, it forges that relationship to
[1:52:22] be stronger because if you can weather
[1:52:24] the storm, then you can definitely
[1:52:26] weather the storm later.
[1:52:29] Is that right, Sister Hannah? You can
[1:52:32] weather the storm because God puts those
[1:52:34] things because it's not so much that you
[1:52:36] have faith in your spouse, but you have
[1:52:38] faith in the one who gave you that
[1:52:39] spouse.
[1:52:40] that he doesn't make mistakes. He knows
[1:52:44] what you have need of. So bear in mind
[1:52:48] this Jewish church here that we find the
[1:52:51] Jewish church had their church ages much
[1:52:53] like the gentile church has its church
[1:52:55] ages. And there was a promise of a
[1:52:58] restoration. Job 2 and 28 says I will
[1:53:00] pour out my spirit. You know and as we
[1:53:03] went through last time all that the
[1:53:04] caliber pillar, the polymer worm, the
[1:53:06] cankerworm, the locust, all that they
[1:53:07] had eaten away. The Bible says Job
[1:53:09] prophesied that I will restore saith the
[1:53:12] Lord. And so we find here there was a
[1:53:14] promise of the Holy Ghost to be poured
[1:53:15] back on the church. And yet we find that
[1:53:18] the church was not under an expectation
[1:53:20] to see the prophecy of Joel
[1:53:22] fulfilled. There wasn't synagogue set up
[1:53:25] proclaiming Joel's going to come, his
[1:53:27] ministry and his his revelation is going
[1:53:29] to come. And we find that when God
[1:53:30] poured out his spirit, they believe that
[1:53:32] they were drunk men and
[1:53:34] women. Come on, church. See, on the day
[1:53:37] of Pentecost, that same life that was
[1:53:40] living in Jesus, see, God's intention
[1:53:42] was never to let it only live in one man
[1:53:44] because he said in Genesis, "Let us make
[1:53:46] man in our image and after our
[1:53:49] likeness." God had a purpose in his
[1:53:51] mind. God had a plan that he wanted a
[1:53:54] family. And the same life that he placed
[1:53:56] in the redeemer will be the same life
[1:53:59] that is displayed through those that
[1:54:01] have been redeemed. Yeah. And we find
[1:54:04] here, notice now, God was not only going
[1:54:06] to allow that word to fall to the
[1:54:08] ground. God has to watch over his word.
[1:54:10] There's got to be somebody that was
[1:54:12] going to be the recipients and the
[1:54:14] beneficiaries of the day of Pentecost.
[1:54:16] And what God did there at the end of the
[1:54:19] the the the Jewish church age, he's
[1:54:21] going to do again at the end of the
[1:54:23] Gentile churches. Why? Because God's
[1:54:25] word has to be fulfilled and he has to
[1:54:28] watch over. And I'm here to tell you
[1:54:30] what was it then? It was power that
[1:54:32] would raise up a church to believe. And
[1:54:34] it's power again today to raise up a
[1:54:37] church to believe. A church that went
[1:54:39] down into dark denominationalism, but a
[1:54:41] church that would rise again. A church
[1:54:43] that would resurrect again. She would
[1:54:46] come out of the darkness. And she would
[1:54:47] rise and be the powerful church that God
[1:54:50] intended her to be
[1:54:55] on the day of Pentecost. Don't be afraid
[1:54:58] with that term.
[1:55:01] Don't be afraid about that term
[1:55:03] Pentecost. Some of you may have come
[1:55:05] from different backgrounds, but let me
[1:55:06] tell you, we're not talking about Isuza.
[1:55:10] We're not talking about the the
[1:55:12] denomination Pentecost. I'm talking
[1:55:14] about the day of Pentecost. I'm talking
[1:55:16] about when licks of fire came upon the
[1:55:19] people and the logos divided itself and
[1:55:21] sat on this one and that one and they
[1:55:23] begin to speak in tongues and they begin
[1:55:25] to act like they were drunk men and
[1:55:27] women.
[1:55:30] When was the last time people accuse you
[1:55:32] of being
[1:55:36] drunk? Come
[1:55:40] on. Somebody act a little indifferent.
[1:55:44] Maybe we have our own
[1:55:47] churchity. When's the last
[1:55:50] time I'm not picking, so please,
[1:55:54] when's the last time have you got so
[1:55:56] stimulated by the word?
[1:56:01] Well, my preacher don't I ain't talking
[1:56:02] about your preacher. I'm talking about
[1:56:04] when's the last time that word has
[1:56:07] struck that cord on the inside of you.
[1:56:10] When's the last time has it struck there
[1:56:12] and you got a kid that's sick, but a
[1:56:14] word came across that. I don't have to
[1:56:16] accept that sickness. I got a healer on
[1:56:18] the scene. I got a Jesus. By my stripes,
[1:56:22] I am healed. And that word strike your
[1:56:24] heart and stimulation comes about.
[1:56:27] When's the last time,
[1:56:29] church? Have you been through a dark
[1:56:31] trial and God brings you out and he puts
[1:56:34] it in your heart? I'm going to bring you
[1:56:35] out of this trial. I'm going to bring
[1:56:37] you out of this
[1:56:41] situation. And we come to church like
[1:56:43] thankless little
[1:56:47] sheath just, oh well, that's God
[1:56:51] supposed to do that.
[1:56:53] stimulation.
[1:56:55] Stimulated by the revelation of the word
[1:57:00] stimulated. The Bible says in John,
[1:57:02] Revelations 5,
[1:57:05] John, John, he had the elders, brother
[1:57:08] Thomas, he didn't just have a couple
[1:57:09] preachers on the platform. He had the
[1:57:12] elders through the ages behind
[1:57:16] him. John didn't care how he acted. John
[1:57:19] didn't care what they thought. John
[1:57:22] said, "All of heaven, all that was down
[1:57:25] on earth, everything under, everything
[1:57:27] that was in hell, everything that was in
[1:57:30] the sea, they heard I John shouting and
[1:57:33] rejoicing because John John saw his name
[1:57:36] in the book." John realized, "I've been
[1:57:38] redeemed. There's a lamb that takes away
[1:57:41] the sins of the world." And he took my
[1:57:43] sins. He took my shame. He took them
[1:57:46] away. And I got the revelation.
[1:57:49] I won't go down in hell, but I'm gonna
[1:57:51] go up in victory.
[1:57:54] Come on, church. What about the
[1:57:55] stimulation from the word?
[1:58:00] God has filled the people with power.
[1:58:02] The church again with power, with the
[1:58:04] word like under a word that's never been
[1:58:07] before.
[1:58:13] And we don't have any expectation when
[1:58:16] we come to the house of God.
[1:58:22] Brother Brown makes a statement as I
[1:58:24] start trying to wrap all this
[1:58:26] up. Here's Peter and John. They done
[1:58:29] been to
[1:58:32] Pentecost. Come on, Tommy. Walk with me.
[1:58:35] Come
[1:58:36] on. We're about the same
[1:58:39] size. Okay. Okay.
[1:58:46] Peter and John. walking. Come on, walk
[1:58:50] with me. You ain't no preacher. No.
[1:58:53] Peter and John, we both wishing we was
[1:58:56] five foot, six foot tall. Not 5 foot. We
[1:58:58] already 5 foot walking. Here comes a
[1:59:01] lame
[1:59:03] man. You done been to Pentecost. Yeah, I
[1:59:06] done been to
[1:59:07] Pentecost. It ain't just hearsay. It
[1:59:10] ain't just something I'm hearing
[1:59:12] somebody else said about it or somebody
[1:59:14] else said about it. No, I just
[1:59:15] experienced it. I just felt it. That
[1:59:17] same power, that same Holy Ghost. That
[1:59:20] same one that Joe spoke of is no longer
[1:59:22] on the pages of the Bible. Now it's in
[1:59:24] my heart. Now I'm believing for it. Now
[1:59:26] I'm witnessing for it. And we're going,
[1:59:28] Tom. We're going to the church. We're
[1:59:30] going to pray. And we find a lame man
[1:59:32] there. He's lame in his feet. And he
[1:59:34] says, "Silver and gold have I none but
[1:59:37] such as I have." Brother Glenn, you can
[1:59:39] rise up this morning and those things
[1:59:41] that touch you won't touch you no more.
[1:59:44] Why? Because the word has been
[1:59:45] prophesied over
[1:59:49] it. The word has
[1:59:52] power. Power to heal the sick. Power to
[1:59:55] raise the dead. Power to raise the
[1:59:58] Power to open blinded
[2:00:02] eyes. Restored power back to the church.
[2:00:11] What if that lame
[2:00:13] man? Let's just
[2:00:16] dramatize. He's crippled. He done been
[2:00:19] placed there for 40
[2:00:24] years. 40 years. He's placed in the same
[2:00:30] spot. Like some of you, you come, heaven
[2:00:35] forbid, somebody sit in your pew.
[2:00:40] Don't you know I pay my tithe, I get
[2:00:43] that
[2:00:45] seat. That's my seat.
[2:00:49] Come on,
[2:00:53] beggar. Don't refrain yourself to a
[2:00:55] certain
[2:00:56] seat. Cuz in that young man's mind,
[2:00:59] brother
[2:00:59] Tommy, he had prayed. He had heard about
[2:01:03] Jesus. He had heard about the healing of
[2:01:05] the sick. He had heard about how he
[2:01:06] delivered and now this Jesus is off the
[2:01:09] scene and no doubt he wondered. He'd
[2:01:10] offered all these prayers for 40 years.
[2:01:12] Do I have to come back to this same
[2:01:15] spot? I don't want to come back, Sister
[2:01:18] Hannah, to this same spot. Come in
[2:01:21] church dragging. No different. No hope.
[2:01:25] No faith to believe it's going to be
[2:01:27] different this time. No excitement at
[2:01:30] the work and change my heart. Why am I
[2:01:31] here? I've moved hundreds of miles. I
[2:01:34] left my family. What is bringing me
[2:01:35] here? I'm telling you, it ain't some man
[2:01:37] bringing you here. This a word drawing
[2:01:40] you into his
[2:01:41] presence. Drawing you into his pres
[2:01:44] drawing you not just to a seat, church.
[2:01:46] No, don't just don't to just a seat, but
[2:01:49] he's drawing you into his presence.
[2:01:53] What if what if he would have
[2:01:56] said to Peter and to my John who just
[2:01:59] went and sat down leaving me preaching
[2:02:00] this message all alone, I didn't tell
[2:02:03] you to go sit
[2:02:05] down. What if he would have said, "Well,
[2:02:07] my case is
[2:02:10] different. You don't
[2:02:12] understand. My situation is different.
[2:02:17] Haven't I not tried for 40 years to
[2:02:21] wiggle my toes and I couldn't? To bend
[2:02:24] my ankles and I can't. Peter, don't you
[2:02:28] think I've made every effort possible?
[2:02:30] I'll say this per
[2:02:32] adventure. Per adventure, your case is
[2:02:35] different. He's still the same
[2:02:36] yesterday,
[2:02:38] today, and forever.
[2:02:42] Your case may be different, but my God
[2:02:45] is still the same. He still heals. He
[2:02:48] still delivers. He still sets free. Let
[2:02:51] me tell you, that's my God.
[2:02:56] And notice Peter and
[2:02:58] John, they didn't look at his
[2:03:01] situation. Like some of us, we look at
[2:03:03] each other's situation. Man, they must
[2:03:05] have done something terrible.
[2:03:08] Oh my goodness. can't believe
[2:03:13] that born from his mother's womb,
[2:03:18] crippled. But in his heart, he saw
[2:03:22] himself
[2:03:24] walking. In his heart, he saw those legs
[2:03:27] moving. He never felt it before. He
[2:03:30] didn't know what to expect. But in his
[2:03:32] heart, there was a deep calling out.
[2:03:35] And here come a Peter. And here come a
[2:03:38] John who just left Pentecost.
[2:03:41] They had an experience, not some
[2:03:44] tradition passed down from generation to
[2:03:46] generation, not some creed, not some
[2:03:49] idea, but no, they had met the pillar of
[2:03:51] fire for theirel just like Moses met the
[2:03:54] same pillar of fire. And your prophecy
[2:03:56] at which Moses lacked a pillar of fire
[2:03:59] had it. That burning bush had exactly
[2:04:01] what Moses needed. And I'm here to tell
[2:04:03] you today, without the born again, Holy
[2:04:05] Ghost fil experience, you'll never make
[2:04:06] a rapture. But I'm here to tell you,
[2:04:08] this word has it. It's for you today,
[2:04:10] young people. It's for you today. You
[2:04:12] don't have to just go through life
[2:04:13] drifting said, "Oh, I I go to certain
[2:04:15] certain church. I believe the message. I
[2:04:18] believe a prophet." It's more than
[2:04:19] believing the message. It's more than
[2:04:21] believing a prophet. It's being born
[2:04:23] again. It's receiving the power. God, I
[2:04:26] say turn the power on to the unit and
[2:04:29] let sons and daughters of God be
[2:04:31] electrified, be stimulated by the word.
[2:04:36] Stimulation from revelation, we know who
[2:04:38] we are and we know who we're not.
[2:04:44] Lord, we know who we are and we know who
[2:04:48] we are not.
[2:04:51] So, I
[2:04:52] wonder how many of
[2:04:55] us in a service like
[2:04:58] today, Brother Joe, you don't know my
[2:05:02] situation. You don't know what's going
[2:05:04] on in my
[2:05:06] family. You don't know the doctor's
[2:05:08] report I just got. You don't know the
[2:05:10] symptoms I'm dealing
[2:05:12] with. You're right. I don't. But silver
[2:05:16] and gold have I none.
[2:05:19] But such as I
[2:05:21] have, if you go listen to perfect
[2:05:26] faith, if you go listen to perfect
[2:05:29] faith, there's a part in that message
[2:05:32] toward the end, brother Bram says, I
[2:05:34] believe God can use my faith, the faith
[2:05:38] that I have to heal you. When your faith
[2:05:41] is weak, when your faith can't muster
[2:05:45] up, God can use my faith. He says,
[2:05:48] "You're going to get blood out of
[2:05:49] anything, you got to get blood from
[2:05:50] something that's got some blood in it."
[2:05:53] All right? You know that old saying, you
[2:05:55] can't get blood out of a turnup because
[2:05:57] there ain't no blood in it. And you
[2:05:59] don't bring some Holy Ghost faith
[2:06:01] building having a Holy Ghost revival and
[2:06:03] bring some dead preacher there to try to
[2:06:05] preach a Holy Ghost revival because you
[2:06:06] ain't going to get nothing out of it.
[2:06:08] No. Would you preach somebody that'll
[2:06:09] bring you up in faith?
[2:06:13] And I'm here to tell you, God is able to
[2:06:15] do that this morning where he was.
[2:06:16] There's a Peter, there's a John walking
[2:06:18] by your way this morning. You may be
[2:06:20] sitting there crippled. It may look like
[2:06:22] your case ain't getting any better. It
[2:06:23] seems like, well, my case is different.
[2:06:25] It may be different, but God never
[2:06:27] changes. His word never changes. There's
[2:06:29] still power in the blood. And if you can
[2:06:31] receive the blood for yourself this
[2:06:33] morning, it'll take your your old beggar
[2:06:35] crippleness away. It'll take the
[2:06:37] sickness away. It'll take the bondage
[2:06:39] away. It'll break the chains off your
[2:06:40] life. It'll set you free this morning.
[2:06:43] You don't got to wait for two weeks for
[2:06:45] your meeting. You can have an experience
[2:06:46] this morning because he is the same. He
[2:06:49] is the same. He's the same
[2:06:51] yesterday. Come on, church. I'm talking
[2:06:54] to you about a God that's got power, a
[2:06:56] word that's got power, an energy behind
[2:06:59] it that'll give you life this
[2:07:02] morning. And it causes stimulation.
[2:07:12] Well, if I got a hat like you, I don't
[2:07:13] want it. I promise you, you wish you had
[2:07:15] it.
[2:07:20] Cuz we don't always feel this way.
[2:07:23] No. Let me hurry up and bring this down.
[2:07:26] I got four
[2:07:27] minutes. Yeah. You laugh.
[2:07:32] If you got faith this morning,
[2:07:36] church. Yeah. I got a 10-hour drive
[2:07:39] home. If you have faith this morning,
[2:07:42] it's time that you make your decision.
[2:07:46] Think about that. That crippled man, he
[2:07:49] had to make a decision. Am I going to
[2:07:52] sit here? Am I going to wallow?
[2:07:56] Because I never felt my legs before.
[2:07:59] Am I going to stay confined to my spot
[2:08:03] just because I never been to another
[2:08:04] spot before?
[2:08:08] God in his sovereignty and his grace
[2:08:13] sent a
[2:08:14] Peter without a John because John sat
[2:08:17] down on
[2:08:19] Peter. Peter's doing all the work.
[2:08:24] Send a Peter and a John. Don't get a
[2:08:28] Tommy because he'll sit down on you.
[2:08:30] Send a
[2:08:33] Joe to a say silver and gold without
[2:08:38] money without price. You don't have to
[2:08:41] be confined to that
[2:08:43] lifestyle. You don't have to remain a
[2:08:45] sinner. You don't have to remain sick.
[2:08:48] You can make a choice. He said, "You got
[2:08:51] to make a decision. If you got faith,
[2:08:53] make a decision this
[2:08:56] morning." You know, if I was you, I'd
[2:08:58] make a decision. I'm not coming back to
[2:08:59] that spot.
[2:09:06] If I was you, I'd make a decision. I'm
[2:09:09] not coming back to that spot. I don't
[2:09:11] care how long I got to
[2:09:13] stay. Come on, Buddy Robinson.
[2:09:16] I don't care how long I got to stay, but
[2:09:19] if you don't give me the Holy Ghost,
[2:09:22] then you'll find a pile of bones when
[2:09:23] you get back.
[2:09:26] I wonder about a young person, about a
[2:09:28] real
[2:09:30] experience, make a
[2:09:33] decision,
[2:09:34] stimulation of
[2:09:37] revelation revealed to
[2:09:39] you. Maybe you There was a quote,
[2:09:42] Brother Bam, and I'm going to bring this
[2:09:43] to a close position. Start making your
[2:09:44] way back.
[2:09:46] There was a young
[2:09:47] boy at Ko Tabernacle. Brother Bam didn't
[2:09:50] get an opportunity to pray in a prayer
[2:09:51] line for him. They brought him to the
[2:09:53] back and the boy had polio. He was a
[2:09:58] Young boy, maybe 17, 18 years
[2:10:02] old. Crippled. Not his
[2:10:06] choice. But sometimes, you know, God
[2:10:08] allow you to go through a great big
[2:10:09] trial so he can shake the world with
[2:10:12] your testimony.
[2:10:16] He'll shake the world with your
[2:10:19] testimony. So this boy, he had polio and
[2:10:22] they brought him to the back and brother
[2:10:23] Brandham went back there and he asked
[2:10:25] brother, he said, "Brother Brandham, do
[2:10:26] you have any consolation for me?" He
[2:10:28] said, "Yeah, polio got you this way." He
[2:10:30] said, "Yeah, that's right." He says,
[2:10:32] "Your name is such and such." He said,
[2:10:33] "That's right." He says, "What about my
[2:10:35] healing, Brother
[2:10:37] Brandham, and your prophet?"
[2:10:40] He didn't make something up in his
[2:10:43] mind. He didn't declare something based
[2:10:46] on compassion. But he took this young
[2:10:48] boy back to the word and said, "By his
[2:10:53] stripes, you are healed.
[2:10:57] by his stripes. Not brother Brandham's
[2:11:00] stripes, not Oral
[2:11:02] Robertson, not Billy
[2:11:04] Graham, not some great teacher of that
[2:11:07] day, some great evangelist, some healing
[2:11:08] revival evangelist of that day. Not by
[2:11:11] any of that. Not by your Donnie
[2:11:13] Reagan's, Thomas Berser, Tim Pruis, Joe
[2:11:16] Adams. Not by any of these preachers,
[2:11:20] but by his stripes
[2:11:23] you are healed.
[2:11:27] And this little boy crippled with polio
[2:11:31] goes home and he begins to confess, "I'm
[2:11:34] healed. I'm healed." The Lord, notice,
[2:11:37] he begins to
[2:11:39] confess to
[2:11:41] confess though he has not felt one ounce
[2:11:44] of
[2:11:45] healing. And he began to make a
[2:11:47] reproach. And so a group of ministers
[2:11:50] come to his house. Brother Thomas, could
[2:11:52] you imagine a group of us message
[2:11:55] believers going to one of your members
[2:11:57] house and saying, "You're making a
[2:11:59] reproach in Elton, Kentucky for
[2:12:01] believing such nonsense as
[2:12:05] healing." And this boy looked at this
[2:12:07] group of
[2:12:09] preachers. He said,
[2:12:12] "Sir, if you were sitting where I'm
[2:12:15] sitting, if you were sitting in the
[2:12:17] chair that I'm sitting in, would you try
[2:12:20] to rob me of my last hope in
[2:12:23] Christ? Would you try to rob me of my
[2:12:26] last hope in Christ?" See, some people
[2:12:30] will never hear about a God that
[2:12:33] delivers because churches don't preach
[2:12:35] about a God that does supernatural.
[2:12:37] today. The today is a miracle that is
[2:12:41] over. God does if if it's God's will to
[2:12:44] heal, then he will heal you. It is God's
[2:12:46] will. The Bible says that healing is a
[2:12:48] children's bread.
[2:12:50] It's in God's word. By my stripes, you
[2:12:52] are already healed. And he said, "By his
[2:12:56] stripes, I am already healed." And at
[2:12:58] that moment, up out of that seat, he
[2:13:00] went and began to run around the place.
[2:13:03] Why? Because he wasn't looking at what
[2:13:05] man said about it. He caught a
[2:13:08] revelation. A revelation that God said I
[2:13:11] was healed. And up from that crippled
[2:13:13] condition, he be to run around and he
[2:13:16] was stimulated from revelation because
[2:13:19] he had met the same God. Oh church,
[2:13:22] don't let some preacher, don't let some
[2:13:24] idea, don't let some decree rob you of
[2:13:27] your last hope. Jesus Christ is the
[2:13:30] same. He heals the same. He delivers the
[2:13:33] same. He sets free the same.
[2:13:40] He is our
[2:13:41] [Music]
[2:13:43] God. But you got to make a
[2:13:47] decision. Do you sit
[2:13:50] there and say,
[2:13:52] "Well, the God of the 60s and the
[2:13:57] 50s, man, we've not seen that God around
[2:14:00] here in years.
[2:14:04] He don't do those things
[2:14:06] anymore. That's only for the
[2:14:09] disciples. That's only for those men.
[2:14:13] Those men that walk with the prophet,
[2:14:16] can I tell you it's for you this
[2:14:18] morning? But you got to make a decision.
[2:14:21] You got to believe. You got to cast down
[2:14:23] doubt. You got to put down unbelief. You
[2:14:25] got to say, "It's for me. It's for my
[2:14:27] family. It's for my children. It's for
[2:14:30] us today." You don't have to stay in
[2:14:32] that that old slooper or slumber that
[2:14:34] you're in. You can rise up this morning
[2:14:36] and you can walk around stimulated by
[2:14:39] revelation. I am a son of God. I am a
[2:14:43] child of God. I got victory this morning
[2:14:46] and it comes from Jesus
[2:14:50] Christ. Come on, church. Make a decision
[2:14:54] this morning. The altar's open. It's
[2:14:56] between you and God.
[2:14:58] Some of you sitting here this morning
[2:15:00] backsliding. You don't have to stay
[2:15:01] backsliding. It's a choice to stay that
[2:15:04] way.
[2:15:07] Well, the altar is open and the grace of
[2:15:11] God is
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:17] flowing. I wonder I
[2:15:20] wonder on a Sunday morning. That's
[2:15:23] right.
[2:15:25] How about somebody get behind sister?
[2:15:27] How about somebody
[2:15:29] walk out of that crippled condition?
[2:15:31] Walk out of that situation. Walk out of
[2:15:33] that dark slumber you've been in. Walk
[2:15:35] out of that cold indifferent walk that
[2:15:37] life you've been look. Make your
[2:15:39] decision this morning. You say, "Oh, oh,
[2:15:41] you know what? They're making us see. I
[2:15:43] don't care what they're doing. They're
[2:15:44] making a stand for God this morning. I'm
[2:15:47] going to walk for him. I'm going to
[2:15:48] serve him. I don't care what the church
[2:15:50] says about it. I don't care what the
[2:15:52] preachers say about it. He's my
[2:15:55] God. Come on,
[2:15:58] church. What about your situation? What
[2:16:01] about that dark cloud hanging over you?
[2:16:02] Come on, brother John. You got a need in
[2:16:04] your body this morning. Get up and walk
[2:16:06] it
[2:16:08] out. Don't be ashamed of them this
[2:16:10] morning. Come on, church. It's time to
[2:16:13] start walking. Make
[2:16:15] footprints. Footprints means possession
[2:16:18] this morning. Find your place in this
[2:16:20] line. Say, "I'm going to walk with him.
[2:16:26] He was
[2:16:27] wounded. He was wounded for my
[2:16:29] transgressions. He was bruised for my
[2:16:32] iniquities. That wasn't just for a
[2:16:34] prophet. That wasn't just for the 60s
[2:16:36] and the 50s. That's for you this
[2:16:39] morning. He was
[2:16:42] bruised. He's here.
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:17:00] By his stripes I am
[2:17:08] healed. Oh, he has healed my sick soul.
[2:17:14] [Music]
[2:17:19] He was bruised for our
[2:17:24] uniquity. Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:17:29] Oh, and

[2:17:33] bore our
[2:17:36] sorrow. Yes,
[2:17:38] Lord. And
[2:17:41] by his stripes we are. Come on. Will
[2:17:45] there be another this morning? Come on,
[2:17:46] church. We got new members here. We got
[2:17:50] old members here. We got those walking
[2:17:53] in sickness. Some walking in bondage.
[2:17:55] Walk out of it this morning. Walk out of
[2:17:57] that prison cell. The King of King is
[2:18:00] here. The Lord of Lords is here this
[2:18:02] morning. He's here to walk out. He's
[2:18:03] here to grab you by the hand and raise
[2:18:06] you from that crippled condition.
[2:18:08] And when you come back, you don't have
[2:18:11] to come back to that same seat. You
[2:18:13] don't have to come back bound by
[2:18:14] depression. You don't have to come back
[2:18:16] bound by suicidal thoughts. You don't
[2:18:18] have to come back bound by sickness. You
[2:18:20] can go back to your seat walking and
[2:18:22] leaping and praising God. I said walking
[2:18:26] and leaping and praising God for the joy
[2:18:29] of the Lord is our strength this
[2:18:32] morning. Oh, praise your name, Lord.
