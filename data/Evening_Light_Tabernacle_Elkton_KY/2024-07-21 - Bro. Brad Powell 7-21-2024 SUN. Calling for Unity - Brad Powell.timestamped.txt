[0:00] from cover to cover tells us how what
[0:02] will happen and what our faith should be
[0:05] maybe I can't live it doesn't make it
[0:07] the truth if they would have simply just
[0:09] stayed with the truth read it and
[0:11] believed it where would we be 20
[0:14] centuries later I don't think we'd be in
[0:16] the position we're at this morning but I
[0:18] was thinking in uh the 14th chapter of
[0:21] John this uh I'll just read a few
[0:24] scriptures here and these scriptures
[0:28] here I I read the
[0:30] I I mean my Bible's all T apart I I read
[0:33] this gospel a lot but this is let your
[0:36] hearts not be troubled believe you in
[0:38] God and believe also in me so Jesus is
[0:42] telling you to believe in him no matter
[0:45] what happens out there in the world
[0:46] what's going on in your heart or life
[0:48] this morning just simply believe him
[0:50] because he's God this morning and in my
[0:53] in my father's house are many mansions
[0:55] if it were not so I would not have told
[0:57] you I go to prepare a place for you fact
[1:00] right there if you've got the faith of
[1:02] Jesus Christ abiding in you this morning
[1:05] that promise is settled with you this
[1:06] morning you're not going to doubt no
[1:08] matter what your circumstances are
[1:10] you're not going to doubt that scripture
[1:12] this morning you're going to apply it
[1:14] every day to your life you're going to
[1:16] go and apply it you're just not going to
[1:18] disbelieve and he goes on to say and if
[1:21] I go prepare a place for you I will come
[1:23] again and receive you onto
[1:25] myself that where I am that you may be
[1:27] also and whether I go go you know that
[1:30] the way excuse me I'm I'm not reading
[1:33] that and whether I go you know and the
[1:35] way you know so and this whole time
[1:38] walking the Earth Jesus showed them the
[1:40] way he gave them the word on what they
[1:43] should believe and even his disciples in
[1:45] the end wavered in the end and he just
[1:48] simply told him to believe and that's
[1:51] all we have to do is believe and whether
[1:53] I go you know the way you know and then
[1:56] you we all know what Thomas said Thomas
[1:58] said unto him Lord we know not whether
[2:01] thou goest how can we know the way and
[2:03] Jesus said to him I am the truth and I
[2:07] am the way the truth and the life no man
[2:09] cometh to the father but by me and that
[2:12] scripture right there is divided the
[2:14] whole world this morning because you
[2:15] can't get there any other way than
[2:17] through Jesus Christ this morning you
[2:20] can fight I mean they can fight you over
[2:22] it they can kill you over it they might
[2:24] not choose to believe that but that's
[2:26] what tears the world apart that's simple
[2:28] scripture right there you can't bring
[2:30] any other religion through the word of
[2:32] God and get it through that scripture
[2:34] it's not going to happen this morning if
[2:37] you know me you should have known my
[2:38] father also from hence forth you know
[2:41] him and have seen him and I'm I'm going
[2:43] to stop my I could I'd wind up reading
[2:46] this whole chapter this morning but you
[2:48] know and then we know what Peter said
[2:49] and then Jesus said when you've seen the
[2:52] father you've when you've seen me you've
[2:54] seen the father but if you would turn
[2:56] with me to
[2:57] um uh Cor
[3:01] I don't lose this page out of my Bible
[3:03] turn with me to Corinthians the uh 15th
[3:07] chapter this
[3:08] morning I shouldn't say that you know
[3:11] like the brother was saying you know
[3:13] when
[3:14] you you can study all night you can you
[3:18] can do everything but if God's not in it
[3:22] it's not going to prosper you just got
[3:24] to you know the hardest thing I ever
[3:26] learned is that you you got to be
[3:28] willing just to let go sometimes and
[3:31] that's the hardest thing to do but th
[3:33] this is the this is the quote from this
[3:36] morning on the July 21st it goes back to
[3:39] acts the 27th chapter and it talks about
[3:43] uh this it talks about the journey Paul
[3:45] made to get to Rome and I'll just read
[3:48] the the it comes I'm not going to go to
[3:51] acts but after a long absence Paul Paul
[3:54] stood forth and Miss to them and said s
[3:57] you should have hearkened on me so Paul
[3:59] told him not to set sail that he that
[4:02] there was going to be trouble if they
[4:04] did they didn't believe him so there
[4:06] goes back to Faith they didn't have
[4:08] enough faith in Paul to believe what he
[4:10] had to
[4:11] say have not loose from CRE and to have
[4:14] gained this harm and lost but I now
[4:17] exhalt you to be of good chair for there
[4:19] shall be no loss of any man's life among
[4:22] you but of the ship for there stood by
[4:25] me this night an angel of God whom whose
[4:29] I am and whom whom I serve saying fear
[4:31] not Paul thou might thou must be brought
[4:34] before Caesar and lo God has given thee
[4:36] all them that sell with thee wherefore
[4:38] sir be of good share I for I believe God
[4:42] that it shall be even as it was told to
[4:45] me and I was thinking with all the storm
[4:47] and everything that's going on Paul gave
[4:49] him this word this he told them the
[4:51] truth and I was just thinking that when
[4:53] they even Shipwrecked or before they
[4:55] Shipwrecked the sailors were trying to
[4:57] get off the boat so I mean no matter
[5:00] what there's those that are going to
[5:01] believe and those that aren't going to
[5:03] believe and this is what brother
[5:04] brandham had to say I'm not going to
[5:06] read this this whole page here but it
[5:08] goes back to what was on the board today
[5:11] that was on the projector today this
[5:13] morning about faith says faith is just
[5:16] positive as your eyesight or my feelings
[5:19] to know this desk is there so simply
[5:23] faith is just believing God's word it's
[5:25] positive and everything that it does you
[5:28] don't have to be Ed at frankly it'll be
[5:31] good if you're just a little more simple
[5:33] about it than than what you really are
[5:36] that's right it's just something that
[5:37] you know it's going to be that's all why
[5:40] they couldn't nothing move it out of
[5:42] your way you know it's going to happen
[5:44] nothing can take that can take it out if
[5:48] the doctor stands there and says you're
[5:50] going to die the next hour and you knew
[5:52] that you were going going to get well
[5:55] you was going to get you might as well
[5:56] tell you to cover all over the cancer
[5:59] and left the eaten through you wouldn't
[6:01] scare you one bit no sir now that's
[6:03] faith and I'm not going to read the
[6:05] whole thing but that's what I'm simply
[6:06] saying this morning no matter what the
[6:08] circumstances are no matter what the
[6:10] situations are this morning if you have
[6:12] real Bible Faith you're just going to
[6:14] believe it because it's God's word and
[6:16] he settled it with you this morning and
[6:19] I'm I was just going to read out of the
[6:21] Corinthians the U 15th chapter here I'll
[6:24] try not to read it I'm not going to read
[6:26] this whole chapter it's 58 verses I
[6:29] might jump around in it but this is
[6:30] where Paul's
[6:32] talking about certain things in this
[6:34] chapter he says moreover Brethren I
[6:36] declare on this is the 15th chapter of
[6:38] First Corinthians moreover Brethren I
[6:41] declare unto you the gospel which I
[6:43] preached unto you which also you have
[6:45] received and wherein stand by which you
[6:48] also are saved if you keep in memory
[6:51] what I have preached unto you unless you
[6:53] have believed in vain it's no different
[6:55] for us this morning the same thing
[6:57] applies to us we have the whole truth as
[6:59] is revealed for the age that we live in
[7:02] we have to do the same thing in our age
[7:04] that Paul's disciples had to do in his
[7:06] age for I have delivered unto you first
[7:09] of all which I also received how Christ
[7:11] died for our sins according to the
[7:13] scriptures and that he was buried that
[7:15] he rose again the third day according to
[7:17] the scriptures and that he was seen of
[7:19] sephus and the 12 and after he was seen
[7:22] of about 500 Brethren at once whom the
[7:25] greater part remain onto this present
[7:28] but some have fallen asleep
[7:30] and then he goes on explaining all these
[7:33] things and I'm jumping down to about the
[7:35] 12th verse here and it says now if
[7:37] Christ preached that he rose from the
[7:40] dead how say some among you there be no
[7:42] resurrection of the dead but if there be
[7:45] no resurrection of the dead then is
[7:47] Christ not risen and if Christ not be
[7:49] risen then you're preaching Vain and
[7:51] your faith is also vain my thought being
[7:54] here it's not vain everything that you
[7:57] believe is going to come up is going
[7:59] toen happened and it goes on to say y we
[8:02] have found false witness in God because
[8:04] you have testified of God that he raised
[8:06] up Christ whom he raised not up if so be
[8:10] that dead not rise if the dead not rise
[8:12] then Christ then is not Christ raised
[8:15] and if Christ not be raised your faith
[8:17] is in vain and are you yet in your sins
[8:20] so basically everything that we believe
[8:23] is based on this one simple
[8:26] principle did he or did he not rise on
[8:28] that day is he risen or isn't he risen
[8:31] and every Christian here this morning or
[8:33] every Christian for the last 20
[8:34] centuries has to have that Revelation
[8:37] deep in their heart this morning has it
[8:39] been made real to you that Jesus Christ
[8:42] has saved you and filled you with his
[8:44] presence this morning you know I know I
[8:46] say that a lot but as I see the world
[8:49] the way it is this morning it's the one
[8:51] simple truth that the world needs this
[8:54] morning is a living savior a living God
[8:58] has risen this morning morning he is
[9:00] more than able to abide in your heart
[9:02] and life this morning and we just simply
[9:04] have to believe in and take faith above
[9:08] I'm I'm losing my train of thought here
[9:10] but the one thing the simplest thing I
[9:12] could say this
[9:14] morning is Faith's not going to fail you
[9:16] on that day if you honestly believe that
[9:19] God has done something for you don't be
[9:21] afraid to tell other people that God's
[9:23] done don't be able to be afraid to live
[9:25] what God's done for you don't be afraid
[9:27] to do the things that God leads you to
[9:29] do this
[9:30] morning
[9:32] I the other thing I was thinking about
[9:34] this morning we we have more than able
[9:38] the promises that are for us this
[9:40] morning are more than able any promises
[9:42] in this Bible I firmly believe that God
[9:45] is more than able to provide it for us
[9:47] this morning and I it goes to say what
[9:50] brother Brandon was saying what no
[9:52] matter what the circumstances I'll
[9:54] finish with the simple thought no matter
[9:56] what your circumstances are this morning
[9:58] here this morning or what my
[10:00] circumstances are I know that God is
[10:03] more than Able by the Revelation that
[10:05] he's given me by the word of God that's
[10:07] in my heart that he's more than able to
[10:08] meet those needs this morning and I
[10:11] don't question it anymore I just simply
[10:13] believe it and that's what I think
[10:15] that's the one thing about this age that
[10:17] we live in this morning you got to get
[10:19] past
[10:21] the you got to get past all your
[10:23] insecurities all your issues all your
[10:26] problems and just simply walk out in
[10:28] faith and believe it if that's basically
[10:31] where we're at this morning you just
[10:33] simply got to believe that you believe
[10:35] and not so so easily be shaken Brother
[10:44] David this morning I was thinking of
[10:47] that little chorus that brother John le
[10:50] Fontaine used to sing the word is
[10:52] working mightily in me no matter what
[10:55] the circumstance what I feel or see the
[10:58] word is working mightily in me you
[11:02] believe that this morning amen let's
[11:04] stand this morning and it's good to be
[11:06] in the house of the Lord this morning
[11:08] and pray you come hungry this morning
[11:10] brother Thomas is gone brother Brad's
[11:12] going to be ministering for us here in
[11:13] just a little while and amen we're just
[11:16] looking for an awesome time in the Lord

[43:34] certainly thankful to be in the house of

[43:40] just uh get settled in here just a
[43:42] minute I'm going to tell you we're going
[43:43] to try to do a little bit of uh teaching
[43:46] more this morning so did y'all bring a
[43:51] snack it won't be too bad thank you
[43:53] musicians appreciate it you know brother
[43:55] brandom I was reading there and I was I
[43:57] was reading about teaching and he said
[43:58] you know Bible teaching is usually a
[44:00] little
[44:02] treacherous he said you know it's a kind
[44:04] of walking on thin ice we call
[44:08] it by the time I was reading this
[44:10] brother berer text me and said we won't
[44:12] be there today I thought oh
[44:13] Lord Pastor is not going to be here and
[44:16] I'm going to try to teach he said but he
[44:19] said we just may feel that way maybe at
[44:21] this point in time it might be good to
[44:22] kind of bring the church to what I think
[44:24] to a complete understanding positionally
[44:27] of what we are in Christ Jesus and
[44:29] sometimes I think that preaching is a
[44:30] wonderful thing he said but teaching
[44:33] goes beyond that he says teaching goes
[44:36] beyond that especially to the church and
[44:39] he says now preaching usually catches
[44:41] The Sinner brings him under condemnation
[44:43] by the word but teaching places the man
[44:46] positionally in what he is I want to
[44:49] know what I am who I am and he says
[44:54] teaching places a positionally and what
[44:56] he is and we can never rightly be able
[44:58] to have faith until we positionally we
[45:02] know what we are so we're going to take
[45:06] our time this morning and and do a
[45:07] little teaching if we might and I don't
[45:09] think we'll be long at all you know I
[45:12] I'm not longwinded but if the holy
[45:14] spirit moves we'll just keep moving okay
[45:16] so you keep pulling I keep keep teaching
[45:18] preaching what however it goes so um
[45:20] turn in your bibles if you would to
[45:22] Genesis 2 and we're also going to read
[45:25] in Revelations 19 read from 2
[45:29] places brother Bor also let me know
[45:31] brother John was needing prayer this
[45:34] morning are you feeling better he's
[45:36] feeling better we're going to continue
[45:37] to hold him up in prayer the devil's
[45:38] just trying to put a licking on his
[45:41] ticker and and uh we're just not going
[45:43] to accept it you know we're going to
[45:45] just pray that it's pulse and blood
[45:46] pressure and circulatory system God made
[45:49] it all you know it's miles and miles and
[45:51] miles of arteries and veins and miles of
[45:54] it that runs through our bodies
[45:58] and if a man can make if God can make a
[46:00] man's body with thousands of
[46:03] miles of arteries and n and nerves and
[46:06] vessels he can sure fix one little valve
[46:08] or one little tick I mean he we know
[46:11] he's better than
[46:13] that so we're just going to keep
[46:15] believing for for brother John's healing
[46:17] there um as we look in Genesis chapter 2
[46:20] and and we'll read at verse 21 I want to
[46:23] just read to you something that the
[46:24] prophet said he said let the Holy Spirit
[46:28] he said let the Holy Spirit Lord bring
[46:30] these people to a full surrender to God
[46:33] that the great father of the Lord Jesus
[46:35] Christ sanctify them soul body and
[46:38] spirit and place them into the body of
[46:41] the Lord Jesus Christ for the marriage
[46:44] of the Lamb is at hand and his bride
[46:48] hath made herself ready oh Lord may this
[46:52] be the night of preparation for tomorrow
[46:56] may be the the day we meet him and you
[47:00] know I thought if if we could live every
[47:02] day with this very thought in mind every
[47:05] time we wake up when we go to bed if we
[47:08] could live with this very thought in
[47:09] mind that tomorrow may be the day that
[47:11] we meet him we would all probably live a
[47:14] little more consecrated we would live a
[47:16] little more dedicated we would live a
[47:19] little more sure of what we believe in
[47:21] in the way we
[47:23] live so Genesis chapter 2
[47:28] verse
[47:29] 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[47:32] to fall upon Adam and he slept and he
[47:35] took one of his ribs and closed up the
[47:38] flesh instead thereof and I I I read
[47:40] that first time it hit me and since I
[47:42] I've read this a thousand times but it
[47:44] said he closed up the flesh instead
[47:46] thereof I thought that way nothing from
[47:48] the outside could get to the
[47:51] inside did you think about that we can't
[47:54] allow the outside stuff to imp penetrate
[47:57] and and dwell within us we need to be
[48:00] closed up with God Almighty full of the
[48:02] Holy Spirit and let the other stuff stay
[48:04] on the
[48:05] outside and he said and the rib which
[48:08] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[48:10] a woman and brought her unto the man and
[48:15] Adam said this is now bone of my bone
[48:18] and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[48:21] called woman because she was taken out
[48:23] of the man and Adam I thought it was it
[48:25] striking says this is bone of my bone
[48:28] this is Flesh of My Flesh this is this
[48:30] is important to me this is something
[48:33] special to me this is not just something
[48:35] that God has placed here but now this is
[48:37] mine God took it from me and made me
[48:41] somebody think about
[48:43] that therefore shall a man leave his
[48:46] father and mother and shall cleave we
[48:48] know what that means to hold on to not
[48:50] let go to to hold it precious and tight
[48:53] unto his wife that they shall be made
[48:56] what one flesh all right turn with me to
[49:00] Revelations chapter
[49:04] 19 and verse
[49:10] five and the voice came out of the
[49:13] throne saying praise our God all ye
[49:16] servants and ye that fear Him both small
[49:18] and great and I heard as it was the
[49:21] voice of a great multitude and as the
[49:23] voice of many Waters and as the voice of
[49:26] mighty Mighty thunderings now I want you
[49:28] to hold on to that Mighty thunderings
[49:30] saying Allelujah for the Lord God
[49:32] omnipotent reth let us be glad and
[49:35] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[49:37] marriage of the Lamb is
[49:42] come and his wife might be
[49:46] ready his wife thinks she may love
[49:50] him his wife looks at other
[49:53] men ah well it got you attention didn't
[49:56] it
[49:58] no it says his wife hath made
[50:01] herself
[50:03] ready and to her was granted that she
[50:06] would be a raid and fine linen think
[50:08] about this fine Ren linen clean and
[50:11] white for the fine linen is the
[50:13] righteousness of the Saints now brother
[50:15] brandham told us and he tells it makes
[50:17] it very clear that the Garment that
[50:18] she's wearing is nothing more than the
[50:21] Holy Ghost she's wearing a garment
[50:24] covered in the Holy Ghost that's the
[50:26] life she's
[50:27] living that's how she hath made herself
[50:33] ready and he saith unto me right blessed
[50:36] are they which are called unto the
[50:38] marriage supper of the lamb and he saith
[50:39] unto me these are true saints of
[50:44] God no falsehood there that's just plain
[50:48] black and white English right there
[50:50] thank you King
[50:51] James let's bow our heads Heavenly
[50:53] Father we just want to tell you this
[50:55] morning how much we love you we
[50:56] appreciate you we thank you Lord for the
[50:59] word you've given us and for the
[51:00] direction you've given us and we trust
[51:02] this morning Lord that you would speak
[51:04] to our hearts you know we're a room full
[51:07] of Christians here and we love you Lord
[51:09] but so many times we find ourselves
[51:11] falling short each one of us we have our
[51:14] battles we have our challenges and Lord
[51:16] we need words of encouragement words
[51:18] that that that push us beyond what we
[51:20] are our limitations are here on the
[51:22] earth so that we know that we're a
[51:24] Heavenly being and we're waiting for for
[51:26] a for a Heavenly bridegroom to come
[51:29] catch a bride away and Lord as we
[51:31] prepare ourselves we ask that you would
[51:32] speak to us give us the words of wisdom
[51:35] and and the words that we need to make
[51:37] sure that we have made ourselves ready
[51:40] and Lord we just want to tell you we
[51:41] love you we lift brother John up to your
[51:44] throne to the throne of of Mercy this
[51:47] morning to the throne of healing we just
[51:49] ask that you would be the great
[51:50] physician that you're the Creator the
[51:52] maker of the body and so we know that
[51:54] you're more than the Healer also Lord we
[51:57] just commit him to you now Commit This
[51:59] Day and the service into your hands in
[52:01] Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be
[52:04] seated this
[52:05] morning I want to speak to you this
[52:09] morning on calling for
[52:12] Unity calling for
[52:15] Unity now you know uh we seen last week
[52:19] after president Trump and the failed
[52:21] assassination on former president Trump
[52:24] what did both parties start doing they
[52:26] start started calling for
[52:28] Unity and these parties said we got to S
[52:31] down we got to tone down we got to pull
[52:33] everybody together we got to find
[52:34] ourselves getting together and and put
[52:36] away some of this hardship put away some
[52:38] of this name calling well you know for
[52:40] them no doubt that's going to be a
[52:42] short-lived a short-lived experiment we
[52:45] might say because in politics that's
[52:48] exactly what they have they have
[52:49] fighting they have bickering they have
[52:51] mudslinging all the ETC you know throw
[52:53] it out there they're going to they're
[52:54] going to put something on somebody else
[52:57] but brothers and sisters there's another
[52:58] calling for Unity that is taking place
[53:01] that calling of unity that's taking
[53:03] place between the bridegroom and his
[53:05] bride and the word tells us blessed are
[53:08] they which are called unto the marriage
[53:10] supper of the lamb and he saith unto me
[53:12] these things are are sayings are the
[53:14] true sayings of God and in this calling
[53:17] of unity there won't be any murmuring
[53:20] there won't be any complaining there
[53:22] won't be any fighting there won't be any
[53:23] bickering there won't be none of that so
[53:26] the Bible tells us let us be glad and
[53:29] rejoice let us be glad and rejoice this
[53:32] morning and to give honor to him for the
[53:34] marriage of the Lamb Has Come For she
[53:36] hath made herself ready so there is a
[53:40] you know the prophet talked about a deep
[53:42] calling to the Deep Well I want to tell
[53:44] you this morning there's a Heavenly
[53:45] bridegroom calling down to a Heavenly
[53:48] bride and she's he's telling her get
[53:51] yourself ready don't fall short get
[53:55] yourself ready I'm I'm coming
[53:57] back now I looked at the word half you
[54:01] know we look at the English language and
[54:03] a lot of words mean different things and
[54:04] I thought I knew what it meant but I had
[54:06] to look it up just to make sure the
[54:08] bride his wife hath made herself ready
[54:11] it says half is an old-fashioned third
[54:14] person singular form of the verb
[54:19] have
[54:23] have so brothers and sisters think about
[54:27] that the bride she hath made herself
[54:31] ready what is that saying to us it says
[54:33] that this bride she's living the life
[54:36] she's got what it takes she's got the
[54:40] word she's got she's ready to go she's
[54:44] not looking around walking around this
[54:45] life in confusion or worried or
[54:47] wondering or trying to figure out who
[54:49] she is she knows who she is she has
[54:53] identified herself with as the Bride of
[54:55] Jesus Christ the one who the bridegroom
[54:58] is coming back for are you with
[55:02] me so let us be glad and rejoice listen
[55:05] to this Unity I'm laying a foundation
[55:08] here
[55:09] Unity Unity is being together or at one
[55:14] with someone or something it's the
[55:17] opposite of being
[55:20] divided pretty simple right but what we
[55:24] find where we find ourselves right now
[55:25] as Christian Christians as bride there
[55:28] is a divide between here and here
[55:31] between the Heaven and the Earth there
[55:33] is a gap
[55:35] there but by Jesus Christ and the
[55:38] stripes and the blood that was shed on
[55:41] Calvary and before the foundation of the
[55:44] world you were on his mind and because
[55:47] of that that Gap has now been bridged
[55:50] and there is a unification taking place
[55:53] between the bridegroom and the bride
[55:55] because she knows who she is I can hear
[56:00] him do you hear him this
[56:05] morning Unity this is a word it says
[56:09] that's for togetherness or Oneness it
[56:12] says when the north won the Civil War it
[56:15] assured the unity of the United States
[56:17] sports teams wear uniforms to show
[56:21] Unity their fans wear their colors for
[56:24] the same reason
[56:26] even if it's red and got a cardinal on
[56:28] it we know where you
[56:30] stand bless your
[56:35] heart the
[56:37] military they wear uniforms to show
[56:39] their what in a
[56:42] unit and those guys are in a unit they
[56:45] look
[56:46] alike they March alike they're in Step
[56:50] they're in tune they think alike they
[56:52] sleep alike they eat alike they do
[56:54] everything alike why because they are in
[56:56] in a unit and they become
[57:06] one people get to
[57:10] bickering that's not
[57:14] unified bickering disorganization
[57:16] there's no
[57:17] Unity you know sometimes in a group it's
[57:20] hard to get people
[57:22] unified somebody's always got a better
[57:24] idea somebody's got a different way of
[57:26] doing it I
[57:29] think it don't work that way with
[57:33] God if you're going to be unified you
[57:35] better get your own stinking thinking
[57:37] out of the way if you're going to be
[57:39] unified with God you better make sure
[57:41] you're doing it the way he wants to do
[57:43] it and live the life he wants to
[57:46] live Unity listen to this an un
[57:49] undivided or unbroken completeness or
[57:52] totality with nothing wanted
[57:57] you want to talk about a unified
[57:59] experience with God we live in such a
[58:02] place we can live in such a place with
[58:03] God that we're so close we're so tied to
[58:06] him that there's no unbroken and there
[58:09] is such a complete he looks down he says
[58:11] you know what I love you so much you're
[58:13] going to want for
[58:18] nothing Unity my favorite one the
[58:22] quality of being fused into
[58:31] one you know a welder can take two
[58:34] pieces of Steel that you can't you can't
[58:36] break you can't bend you can't dent and
[58:39] he can take it he can put enough
[58:41] energy with a welding rod between two
[58:44] pieces of Steel that he can fuse those
[58:46] together and you cannot pull it
[58:49] apart why because there's something
[58:52] that's happened and that's the way it is
[58:53] with a marriage or it should be that way
[58:55] in a
[59:00] marriage brother Brown tells us he says
[59:02] when a Christian first saved his face is
[59:05] he's he's turned towards
[59:07] Christ but then he's got something to do
[59:09] on his for
[59:12] himself that's where it gets sticky
[59:14] that's where it gets hard you say he
[59:16] says see you think the next thing he has
[59:17] to sanctify himself from all unclean
[59:20] habits he has to lay aside every weight
[59:23] he has to get all the things out of his
[59:25] life why because because it's the bride
[59:27] making herself ready she's got to make
[59:29] herself ready and he begins to tell the
[59:31] story and we're going to go into this
[59:33] story in detail so stay with me it's one
[59:35] of the greatest in the message as far as
[59:37] I'm concerned and he tells a story about
[59:40] the the little girl out in the west and
[59:42] he said we're going to go out there and
[59:43] rehearse this for a little while and he
[59:45] said there was this armor and Swift
[59:47] Packing
[59:48] Company and he said the armor and Swift
[59:50] Packing Company he said they come out
[59:52] there and they would buy cattle and they
[59:54] would buy ranches he he said they were
[59:56] so wealthy they were they were worth
[59:58] lots of money buying up all small
[1:00:00] ranches and had millions and millions
[1:00:02] and millions of Acres out there they
[1:00:05] even had uh Herford cattle and he said
[1:00:08] they had enough they had enough money
[1:00:10] and enough Acres that they had their own
[1:00:11] railroad system to move cattle from one
[1:00:14] pasture to another pasture so might we
[1:00:16] say he owned the cattle on a thousand
[1:00:22] hills this man the armor Swift Packing
[1:00:25] Company owned the cattle on a thousand
[1:00:28] hills and he says they had this big
[1:00:30] Ranch and and and one day out there and
[1:00:32] the foreman out there the superintendant
[1:00:34] had four or five
[1:00:36] daughters now these four or five
[1:00:38] daughters out there they all they all
[1:00:40] hungry to get married you know how it is
[1:00:42] when you get a certain age you start
[1:00:43] looking you start wanting you start
[1:00:44] having a desire for
[1:00:47] companionship and so they were looking
[1:00:49] for to get married and he said there
[1:00:50] they was but the the big armor son was
[1:00:54] going to visit the ranch so the son of
[1:00:57] the the armor and Swift Packing Company
[1:00:59] was going to visit the ranch and he said
[1:01:00] he was a young single man and all of the
[1:01:03] girls were sure that they were going to
[1:01:04] grab this boy
[1:01:06] up they were
[1:01:09] sure sounds kind of like the church
[1:01:12] world they're sure that they're going to
[1:01:14] grab him up they're sure that they've
[1:01:17] got
[1:01:18] Christ the message world they're sure
[1:01:27] hm and they was getting ready getting
[1:01:30] ready for him to come they was making
[1:01:32] everything ready now he's talking about
[1:01:35] these four or five girls they was making
[1:01:36] ready
[1:01:38] too think about this you know just well
[1:01:42] I'm just going to say it you find out
[1:01:44] that your son's girlfriend's coming over
[1:01:46] you'll see him sweep floors like you've
[1:01:48] never swept in his
[1:01:53] life I don't know how I know that
[1:01:59] but but here they were they were getting
[1:02:02] ready getting ready to meet him they got
[1:02:04] all doled up they were going out there
[1:02:05] he was going to visit this Ranch and
[1:02:07] they got all doled up and dressed up and
[1:02:10] and they was wanting to get out there
[1:02:11] and catch his
[1:02:13] attention and that's what the church
[1:02:14] world's doing they're trying to catch
[1:02:16] the
[1:02:19] attention stay humble
[1:02:21] bride stay
[1:02:24] humble and he said they got got out
[1:02:26] there and they was going out to meet him
[1:02:27] they put on this frontier days and he
[1:02:29] said they had their little dresses on
[1:02:31] with fringes and 44s on their side and
[1:02:33] they were shooting and hooping and
[1:02:35] hollering and and they had their little
[1:02:37] hats on they were going to be real
[1:02:39] westerners because one of them was going
[1:02:41] to get this boy one of them wanted the
[1:02:44] son of the man that owned the cattle on
[1:02:46] a thousand
[1:02:49] hills but there was a little
[1:02:53] cousin there was a little cousin a
[1:02:55] little a little C cousin girl that had
[1:02:56] been orphaned because her parents her
[1:02:58] mom and her dad had both died and there
[1:03:00] was this little orphan girl and the
[1:03:02] prophet said that she was almost a slave
[1:03:04] to all there was out there now let me
[1:03:07] tell you we can relate to that because
[1:03:11] there was a time that we were alienated
[1:03:13] and found ourselves as slaves to the
[1:03:16] things of this
[1:03:18] world you were a slave to the devil and
[1:03:21] all his
[1:03:23] tactics and I hope none of you still are
[1:03:27] but here she was a slave to all that
[1:03:29] there was and she she had to do all of
[1:03:31] the Dirty Work she did it all she did
[1:03:33] the washing of the dishes no doubt she
[1:03:35] did she did sweeping of the floors she
[1:03:38] done all the laundry all the stinking
[1:03:40] Dirty Laundry of those three or four or
[1:03:42] five other
[1:03:44] girls her
[1:03:47] job she had no
[1:03:49] clothes the prophet said she had to take
[1:03:52] hand me
[1:03:54] downs and so when a Time come for this
[1:03:56] young man to
[1:03:59] arrive they all got in their Buck
[1:04:02] boards they all set away to go down to
[1:04:04] the station because they wanted to
[1:04:06] receive him isn't that the way it is
[1:04:09] everybody wants to receive
[1:04:11] him everybody says I want
[1:04:16] him and they think they're doing what
[1:04:19] they should do to catch his
[1:04:22] attention he said they were shooting
[1:04:24] guns they were hooping and hollering
[1:04:25] they were the horses were nicker and
[1:04:27] they were racing and they were running
[1:04:29] around and and they finally got him
[1:04:31] brought him out to the
[1:04:32] ranch and they at night they had a big
[1:04:38] shindig now listen a big shindig they
[1:04:41] were having
[1:04:44] entertainment when church becomes
[1:04:47] entertainment we've missed the
[1:04:49] mark when our personal lives become
[1:04:53] entertainment to God God I hope you like
[1:04:56] this let me show you what I can
[1:04:58] do that's
[1:05:00] Entertainment God is not pleased with
[1:05:03] entertainment brothers and sisters God

[1:05:07] our
[1:05:09] relationship he wants a life with you he
[1:05:12] wants a love affair with
[1:05:19] you and he said here was this little
[1:05:21] girl she had all this rough work to do
[1:05:24] she didn't go to the
[1:05:27] party let me tell you she wasn't invited
[1:05:30] to the
[1:05:32] party she wasn't welcomed at the

[1:13:45] coming back for a bride with
[1:13:51] character even though brothers and
[1:13:54] sisters think about it even though in

[1:22:18] laughed and mocked and called her
[1:22:20] everything but in a distance A Sound of

[1:22:25] I can imagine them four or five sisters
[1:22:27] said we better get inside a rain's are
[1:22:28] coming oh let me tell you there's a rain
[1:22:31] a coming but it wasn't Thunder it wasn't

[1:22:36] coming to sweep her away and she stood
[1:22:39] there in the door and he said the the
[1:22:41] wheels and the sand started turning
[1:22:42] under the wheels of them horses and
[1:22:44] under the wheels of that carriage and
[1:22:46] about that time he pulled up there and
[1:22:49] that little bride that had made herself
[1:22:51] ready she jumped off that porch she jump
[1:22:54] jumped off that portion through a rose
[1:22:56] trellis and threw herself into the arms
[1:22:58] of The Man Who Loved
[1:23:00] Her there's going to be a day that comes
[1:23:03] when we're going to throw ourselves off
[1:23:05] the porch we're going to throw ourselves
[1:23:07] through the trellis of life and into the
[1:23:09] arms of the greatest lover that the
[1:23:11] world has ever
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:16] [Applause]
[1:23:21] known there's a Heavenly Union taking
[1:23:23] place in this
[1:23:25] hour but we got to be
[1:23:28] ready we got to be ready we can't be put
[1:23:32] on we can't be gimmicks you know there's
[1:23:35] a lot of gimmicks out there there's a
[1:23:37] lot of gimmicks out there that want to
[1:23:38] act like they're the real
[1:23:41] deal but they don't have the
[1:23:44] Garment the Holy Ghost is not working
[1:23:47] through them it's not moving in their
[1:23:48] lives it's not moving in their homes
[1:23:49] it's not moving in their
[1:23:51] churches we can't be a gimmick we can't
[1:23:54] have any put on but we got to be
[1:23:55] genuinely filled with the Holy Ghost our
[1:23:58] garments without spot or
[1:24:00] wrinkle but listen the problem is this
[1:24:02] the problem is everybody want this
[1:24:04] Cinderella story that I've been telling
[1:24:06] you about everybody wants to be
[1:24:08] Cinderella but they're living like
[1:24:09] Cruella
[1:24:12] Deville you young people called
[1:24:16] it
[1:24:19] Cruella
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:22] Cruella oh I've seen 101
[1:24:29] they live in any way they want
[1:24:31] to they live in the life of whatever
[1:24:34] they want to do go wherever they want to
[1:24:36] go say whatever they want to say and
[1:24:38] they're still entertaining
[1:24:40] God hey I'm not talking about
[1:24:44] denominations I'm talking about around
[1:24:47] us we got to be careful churches around
[1:24:50] the message have got to be careful that
[1:24:52] their focus and their first love is
[1:24:54] Jesus Jesus Christ and not an
[1:24:58] entertainment I'm not here to fix the
[1:25:00] message I'm just here to fix
[1:25:05] me but I have to make sure I've got
[1:25:08] myself
[1:25:09] ready the prophet said we know that
[1:25:11] there's going to be a bride there's
[1:25:13] going to be a wedding supper up served
[1:25:15] in the skies that's sure to be as God is
[1:25:17] because it's his word so we know it's
[1:25:20] happening we know it's coming and he
[1:25:23] says we right now the Bride of Jesus
[1:25:25] Christ we've got all the materials on
[1:25:28] Earth right now to make ourselves ready
[1:25:33] notice he said she made herself
[1:25:37] ready I got the table I got the Bible
[1:25:41] what else do I need to make me
[1:25:43] ready what else do you need to make you
[1:25:46] ready I've got the table and I've got
[1:25:48] the
[1:25:49] Bible but do I put in the time
[1:25:54] he saidou see it's up to you you've got
[1:25:56] to do
[1:25:58] something you've got to overcome you've
[1:26:00] got to be the Overcomer that inherits
[1:26:02] all things he said you see because God
[1:26:05] can't push you through a little pipe and
[1:26:07] pull you out through the other side and
[1:26:09] say blessed is you that overcame because
[1:26:11] he's the one that done the pushing in
[1:26:13] that case but you got to be the one that
[1:26:15] makes decisions for
[1:26:17] yourself we've got to decide for
[1:26:19] ourselves I don't want to live the
[1:26:22] stinking life that I'm living and the
[1:26:24] doing the things that I'm doing that God
[1:26:26] does not approve of you got to make that
[1:26:30] decision we can't just say God take away
[1:26:33] everything well wouldn't that be easy
[1:26:34] everybody in the world would be the
[1:26:36] Bride of Jesus Christ there wouldn't be
[1:26:39] an addict there wouldn't be an alcoholic
[1:26:42] there wouldn't be a
[1:26:45] whoremonger but sometimes it takes some
[1:26:47] commitment on our part for God to come
[1:26:50] in and say here I'm going to help you
[1:26:52] but you're going to push you're going to
[1:26:55] push yourself through you're going to
[1:26:56] pull through this
[1:26:58] situation Abraham was promised a child
[1:27:01] and to maintain the promise for 25 years
[1:27:04] through the ups and the downs and The
[1:27:06] Valleys of Life do you realize that the
[1:27:10] children of Israel they were given a
[1:27:11] promise that they would have a promised
[1:27:14] land and they that everything they had
[1:27:16] but they fought and they fought and they
[1:27:18] fought to get that
[1:27:22] land Divine Healing
[1:27:25] the prophet said Divine Healing God has
[1:27:27] the power to heal you if you've got the
[1:27:29] courage to accept
[1:27:31] it it's easy to come up to be prayed for
[1:27:34] but do you accept it are you willing to
[1:27:37] take the exception that God I'm going to
[1:27:39] take what's mine mine
[1:27:44] mine you see God has Amazing Grace the
[1:27:47] prophet said and he can give you that
[1:27:49] Amazing Grace but you're going to fight
[1:27:51] for it you're going to fight for it
[1:27:55] now marriage he says in one sense is a
[1:27:59] type he says the Earthly marriage here
[1:28:01] is a type of the Heavenly marriage and
[1:28:03] let's go over it for you few moments he
[1:28:05] says to
[1:28:07] rehearse first thing that takes place in
[1:28:09] a natural marriage is this okay all
[1:28:12] right I'm gonna preach it anyway so
[1:28:15] might as well like it the first thing he
[1:28:18] says it takes place as in a natural
[1:28:19] marriage is a decision has to be made
[1:28:22] the young lady has to make a DE decision
[1:28:25] do I want this
[1:28:28] man do I want this man and he said and
[1:28:32] then that man has to say do I want this
[1:28:36] woman do I want this young woman he says
[1:28:39] there has to be a decision made she must
[1:28:42] be the only woman in the world that you
[1:28:46] love and he must be the only man in the
[1:28:49] world that you
[1:28:51] love and if it's not you've made a wrong
[1:28:54] wrong
[1:28:56] decision you see the problem lies in
[1:28:59] when people want
[1:29:00] to love
[1:29:04] God but they love something else
[1:29:08] too you see I love God on
[1:29:11] Sunday but on
[1:29:15] Monday that don't
[1:29:17] work a marriage whether it be here your
[1:29:20] home my home God Heaven to Earth to us a
[1:29:24] marriage has to be a full total
[1:29:28] commitment so during this time of
[1:29:31] courtship these deep conversations begin
[1:29:33] to take place these deep conversations
[1:29:36] take place to know that if this person
[1:29:39] is somebody you can
[1:29:42] tolerate why marry somebody you don't
[1:29:43] even
[1:29:48] like I never understood why a woman
[1:29:51] young woman would chase a man that is
[1:29:54] chasing Every Woman around
[1:29:56] town can somebody explain that to
[1:29:59] me who wants that
[1:30:03] filth who wants that
[1:30:06] disease
[1:30:07] yeah let's just put the rubber on the
[1:30:10] road who wants that no good Christian
[1:30:14] man wants that or woman wants
[1:30:21] that but there's deep conversations
[1:30:24] begin to take
[1:30:25] place and a a great poet said ultimately
[1:30:28] the bond of all companionship whether it
[1:30:30] in marriage or friendship is
[1:30:34] conversation you see sometimes we we get
[1:30:37] into a into
[1:30:40] a situation where we don't even converse
[1:30:43] with
[1:30:46] God how does he know if he likes you
[1:30:48] have you ever talked to
[1:30:50] him whoa pin drop
[1:30:57] you see if we're going to get into a
[1:30:58] proper love affair with Christ we have
[1:31:00] to
[1:31:01] talk we have to be able to share
[1:31:03] ourselves with him we have to have an
[1:31:05] active prayer life we have to have an
[1:31:08] active prayer life that is more than
[1:31:09] just a dinner table prayer oh God we we
[1:31:12] good at that God bless this food cuz I'm
[1:31:15] hungry but what about the times when we
[1:31:18] need to get along with God and find
[1:31:20] ourselves in a secret chamber where we
[1:31:22] can have a real
[1:31:24] love heartfelt conversation with
[1:31:27] god where you sit down and you share
[1:31:30] what happened to you today where you sit
[1:31:32] down and you ask for guidance for
[1:31:36] tomorrow you say well I I just get
[1:31:38] overwhelmed with time get up
[1:31:46] earlier you know people do in life what
[1:31:48] they want to
[1:31:51] do if you want to talk to God you can
[1:31:53] get up and
[1:31:55] pray if you don't you can sleep
[1:31:58] in that's your choice we done talk we
[1:32:01] done hit decisions that's your choice
[1:32:04] you can do what you want to do but
[1:32:06] communication is the key we need private
[1:32:09] conversations with God you know what
[1:32:11] I've noticed when my boys take the cell
[1:32:13] phone and they talking to somebody and
[1:32:15] they walk right on past us and go
[1:32:17] outside and sit on the back
[1:32:19] porch they ain't talking to their friend
[1:32:21] at school
[1:32:23] no no no for
[1:32:27] hours
[1:32:32] hours they
[1:32:37] talk well you did it too what are you
[1:32:39] looking at me like that
[1:32:43] four man I didn't know what a bedtime
[1:32:46] was when we were talking 2 3 4:00 in the
[1:32:49] morning I guess I better go sleep I got
[1:32:50] to get up in an hour
[1:32:55] why because it was a secret chamber it
[1:32:58] was a private time we were sharing our
[1:33:00] thoughts and our love and our intents
[1:33:02] with each other and that's what God
[1:33:05] wants from us he wants some passion in
[1:33:07] our
[1:33:11] lives you know what the number one cause
[1:33:13] of divorce
[1:33:15] is lack of
[1:33:19] communication you want to be divorced
[1:33:21] from God don't talk to him
[1:33:25] you want your marriage on the Rocks
[1:33:27] Don't Talk To
[1:33:28] Her don't communicate with each other
[1:33:31] and tell me if your lives don't start
[1:33:34] don't y'all be looking at each other
[1:33:36] we're not playing that
[1:33:41] game but don't talk don't communicate
[1:33:43] with each other don't share your daily
[1:33:45] experiences don't share your love and
[1:33:47] your thoughts with your spouse and see
[1:33:49] if you don't find yourselves growing
[1:33:51] apart and you think well we're just
[1:33:53] going through a a lull we're going
[1:33:55] through a spell and we all do but just
[1:33:58] see if it don't just get bigger and
[1:34:00] bigger if you don't put the put the put
[1:34:02] the end on it if you don't put the
[1:34:04] hammer down on it and say hey I need to
[1:34:06] talk to
[1:34:07] you have a little spat and don't make it
[1:34:10] right see what
[1:34:12] happens some of you's done that it ain't
[1:34:16] a fun
[1:34:18] road divorce number one cause lack of
[1:34:22] communication we don't talk so if we
[1:34:23] don't talk to God how are we ever going
[1:34:25] to know what God's wantan to do in our
[1:34:27] lives how are we ever going to know how
[1:34:29] much he loves us if we don't talk to him
[1:34:32] you know I don't go to to God and talk
[1:34:34] to him and say God give me this give me
[1:34:36] that give me that I just want him to
[1:34:37] know how I feel Lord I had a rough day
[1:34:41] today things went didn't go the way I
[1:34:44] thought they were this happened or that
[1:34:46] happened and you know what I find I
[1:34:48] don't have to ask but I start getting a
[1:34:51] feeling of peace
[1:34:53] I start getting a feeling of love and I
[1:34:56] start getting a feeling of compassion
[1:34:58] that he really cares he listens to me I
[1:35:01] don't have to pray some big Catholic CA
[1:35:04] Catholicism prayer a hell Mary or this I
[1:35:07] just say God this is what happened to me
[1:35:12] today help me
[1:35:15] Lord but the lack of
[1:35:19] communication there was a woman who went
[1:35:21] and met with an attorney and she told
[1:35:22] the attorney she said I want to divorce
[1:35:24] my
[1:35:25] husband and the guy the attorney says
[1:35:27] okay well let's start with a few

[1:39:21] tithing but this is the third service
[1:39:22] and this has been my
[1:39:26] mind I was listening to somebody the
[1:39:28] other day and they made a great
[1:39:29] statement they said the person they were
[1:39:32] talking to a person about tying they
[1:39:33] said you don't even tell me about tying
[1:39:35] I give my
[1:39:36] 10% and he said well I tell you what you
[1:39:38] got you got an understanding of how
[1:39:40] tithing Works what you don't have is an
[1:39:43] understanding that all you have is
[1:39:46] God's it's not the
[1:39:48] 10% that's his just like everything else
[1:39:52] it's what you do above and
[1:39:54] Beyond what are you doing for others how
[1:39:57] are we serving
[1:39:58] others God gives us so so much every one
[1:40:02] of us sitting here is blessed beyond
[1:40:05] measure yeah let's give the Lord a hand
[1:40:08] we've been
[1:40:11] blessed we are worshiping we're serving
[1:40:13] God in a paid off building a probably a
[1:40:17] million doll building
[1:40:23] but what are we doing where is our
[1:40:25] missions where is our goal where is our
[1:40:27] vision how are we serving how are we
[1:40:30] helping what are we doing with the other
[1:40:34] 90 now we're getting in your back
[1:40:40] pocket he says I'll pray many times a
[1:40:43] day I'll do anything I'll pledge all of
[1:40:45] my love to you and he says that's
[1:40:47] exactly what you should do but that
[1:40:50] promise has to come from your heart
[1:40:57] he says look and I tell you the prophet
[1:40:59] can bring some stories in there that
[1:41:01] makes you wonder where in the world did
[1:41:03] he come up with
[1:41:05] this i' ha to been the woman he's talk
[1:41:08] The person he's talking about here he
[1:41:10] says if you ain't got any teeth you use
[1:41:12] false
[1:41:13] teeth he said but those false teeth are
[1:41:16] a substitution for the teeth you once
[1:41:18] had those teeth aren't connected to
[1:41:22] you yeah you take them out he said if
[1:41:24] you had an arm amputated you put on a
[1:41:27] false arm he said but that arm is
[1:41:29] actually not connected with you it's
[1:41:31] just stuck on you and he said when we
[1:41:34] take our pledge to Christ if we don't
[1:41:36] come part of him like a woman ought to
[1:41:39] be part of that man and a man part of
[1:41:41] that woman then we're artificial
[1:41:47] Christians yeah false
[1:41:52] teeth and a prosthetic
[1:41:55] limb an artificial Christians you'll
[1:41:58] never think about a prosthetic limb the
[1:41:59] same again will
[1:42:01] you an artificial Christian because
[1:42:05] you're not fully unified with him you're
[1:42:09] going through the motions you're acting
[1:42:11] you're putting on but yet you're not
[1:42:14] fully fused with
[1:42:18] him he says that's the way the churches
[1:42:20] are we're taking a name taking a name
[1:42:23] the Christian church and pretending to
[1:42:25] be the bride but it's artificial it's
[1:42:28] not connected in any way with Christ
[1:42:31] we're like an artificial tooth an
[1:42:33] artificial arm an artificial
[1:42:36] eye it's something that's artificial if
[1:42:38] we're just putting it on well you can't
[1:42:41] put on Christianity you got to be
[1:42:43] connected with
[1:42:47] it if a woman is not connected with a
[1:42:50] man in
[1:42:51] tress then it isn't her husband she must
[1:42:55] take a vow to live with him and she's
[1:42:58] Tak or she's taken a vow to live with
[1:43:00] him and she took a wrong vow she pledged
[1:43:02] to love him she said she loved him and
[1:43:04] she didn't do it that man's
[1:43:08] deceived now we see this in the natural
[1:43:10] all the
[1:43:11] time oh I love you I love you I want
[1:43:14] there's nobody else I want to live with
[1:43:17] I I want to live the rest of my life

[1:43:20] sweetheart it goes both ways men and
[1:43:22] women next thing you know she's with
[1:43:24] some other guy at the five five
[1:43:26] star or he's over here with some other
[1:43:28] woman at work come on church it was a
[1:43:32] false vow it wasn't a true love to begin
[1:43:35] with and we see it in the church world
[1:43:37] as well it's a false vow they I love you
[1:43:41] Lord I want to do everything for you
[1:43:43] come bless me Lord and they're watching
[1:43:45] filth in the house going to places they
[1:43:47] shouldn't go raising their kids out of
[1:43:49] church don't go to church somebody
[1:43:53] somebody help me this morning it's the
[1:43:55] truth
[1:43:58] Church my wife said how long are you
[1:44:00] going to preach on that until it gets
[1:44:03] fixed every time we go home how long you
[1:44:06] going to preach on coming to church
[1:44:07] until they start
[1:44:09] coming how long you going to preach on
[1:44:11] people not raising their kids right
[1:44:13] until they start raising them right why
[1:44:16] because it matters
[1:44:18] tomorrow you say well it ain't hurting
[1:44:20] nothing today it matters tomorrow
[1:44:23] when he comes back are we ready are your
[1:44:27] children
[1:44:33] ready he says but one thing you won't do
[1:44:35] you you may deceive your husband you may
[1:44:37] deceive your wife you may have give him
[1:44:39] a false vow you won't deceive Christ he
[1:44:42] knows if it's a heartfelt give my heart
[1:44:45] to you
[1:44:47] Lord that's how he know that's how he
[1:44:50] can look at you when you make a mistake
[1:44:52] and that's how he can look at you when
[1:44:54] you make a mistake and he can look and
[1:44:55] say I know you truly love me I know that
[1:44:59] you're in love with me so this little
[1:45:01] flaw that you had I forgive you I wipe
[1:45:03] it
[1:45:04] clean I can wipe the Slate clean you
[1:45:07] know it's hard for marriages to do
[1:45:10] that you let a man cheat on a woman she
[1:45:13] can't trust
[1:45:16] him is this the
[1:45:19] truth it takes years and years and years
[1:45:22] if ever for her to trust him
[1:45:26] again why why is that because we don't
[1:45:31] know Christ he knows he can't be
[1:45:34] deceived we can be deceived and to be
[1:45:37] deceived and lied to hurts as
[1:45:39] humans and we don't
[1:45:46] forget he says when the church has a
[1:45:49] ceremony and makes a promises she takes
[1:45:51] the bridegroom's name she's no longer
[1:45:55] the Church of the world she's the Church
[1:45:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ he says a great
[1:46:01] Universal Apostolic Christian Church she
[1:46:03] becomes part of Christ when she does
[1:46:05] that watch what happens when she does
[1:46:08] that and she gets rid of her old name
[1:46:11] her old Creeds her own doct do Doctrine
[1:46:14] and dogmas her own way of thinking he
[1:46:17] says what happens then is Christ injects
[1:46:20] into her his own
[1:46:27] Spirit I'm no longer Brad
[1:46:30] pal you're no longer John
[1:46:33] lter no longer Joe pit no longer Tommy
[1:46:36] Richmond but your misss Jesus Christ why
[1:46:40] because you've emptied yourself out
[1:46:42] you've dedicated your heart and you said
[1:46:44] Lord pour into me all that you
[1:46:47] are and that's what happens to the
[1:46:49] church he says the two are no longer
[1:46:51] Twain it's no longer the woman and the
[1:46:54] church but the two now have come
[1:46:57] together they are one they're Christ in
[1:47:04] you like my
[1:47:06] wife her name was
[1:47:09] lter but she's no longer
[1:47:12] lter in
[1:47:15] 1996
[1:47:18] yeah she became
[1:47:21] pal and she's been pal ever
[1:47:26] since I found it a odid thing when I
[1:47:29] done some business with some Hispanics
[1:47:31] here a while back they don't change
[1:47:33] their
[1:47:35] names in Mexico I don't know if it's
[1:47:37] ever Spanish Nation or what but in
[1:47:39] Mexico they don't change their name they
[1:47:40] keep their name and just add to it or
[1:47:43] don't even add the husband's name and I
[1:47:46] thought wow is that a is that a Catholic
[1:47:48] thing what is that I'm trying to figure
[1:47:49] it out I don't know but I thought as I
[1:47:52] read this message message I don't want
[1:47:54] my own
[1:47:55] name I want his name to cover me because
[1:47:59] when his name covers me when his name
[1:48:01] covers you you have a new Authority
[1:48:04] about you you have a new way of living
[1:48:06] you has a new life that comes
[1:48:08] forth it's no longer my life no longer
[1:48:11] my desires no longer my wants but I want
[1:48:14] what he wants I want to see Souls saved
[1:48:18] I want to so see young people come to
[1:48:20] Christ I want to see the returning of
[1:48:22] Jesus Jesus God
[1:48:28] Almighty when you come to Christ you're
[1:48:31] no more of the
[1:48:33] world then you care not for the things
[1:48:36] of the world it's dead to you you become
[1:48:38] a different person you become a
[1:48:41] different personality and I like that

[1:48:49] 96 I don't know who this is for but it's
[1:48:51] a lot of marriage going on in this
[1:48:54] service marriage for those that's been
[1:48:56] married those that's thinking marriage
[1:48:58] those that's too young to be
[1:49:01] married but marriage is
[1:49:03] important you know when when we got
[1:49:07] married we come together and we became

[1:51:09] and courting and engagement but there
[1:51:11] was something different when she come to
[1:51:13] my
[1:51:14] house we walked into a new house
[1:51:16] together we no longer went back to our
[1:51:20] parents'

[1:51:46] squabble we ain't been married six
[1:51:49] months you know how it is you going to
[1:51:50] fight fuss throw nah we didn't

[1:52:34] in your own house between you and her
[1:52:36] and figure out how to compliment one
[1:52:39] another and work
[1:52:41] together because that's what
[1:52:44] happens think about the
[1:52:47] church you and Christ become
[1:52:50] one you can't go sharing your trouble
[1:52:52] with the
[1:52:54] devil well I can't overcome Satan I
[1:52:57] can't overcome this I thought God would
[1:52:59] give me the strength but I just can't
[1:53:01] overcome it well you can't well come
[1:53:02] here let me tell you what you need you
[1:53:03] need to just do it more and more and
[1:53:05] more you see that's the way it works why
[1:53:08] would people take marriage counseling
[1:53:10] from people that have marriage
[1:53:12] problems why do people take dating
[1:53:15] advice from people who's never been
[1:53:17] married we're going to be here all day
[1:53:19] we just keeps coming
[1:53:23] but at a point in your time in your life
[1:53:26] Jesus has to become everything to you
[1:53:29] and there's a song that I just been
[1:53:30] singing and singing and I love it but it
[1:53:32] says some have made Jesus a game that
[1:53:34] they play and others a song that they
[1:53:37] sing but since I've met Jesus I'm happy
[1:53:40] to say that he has become everything to
[1:53:46] me when I wake up each morning he's
[1:53:49] right by my side at night he's my last
[1:53:51] thought in mind M for he's joy for each
[1:53:54] moment he's hope that Faith brings to me
[1:53:57] he's become
[1:53:59] everything oh he's everything that I
[1:54:03] need the first and the last the
[1:54:06] beginning the end to me he's become
[1:54:11] everything we might ought to try to sing
[1:54:13] at
[1:54:15] sometime but he's become everything he
[1:54:18] has to be first in your life so let me
[1:54:19] ask your husbands think before you
[1:54:22] answer answer I'm queuing you let me ask
[1:54:25] you now listen again think before you
[1:54:28] answer who comes first in your
[1:54:35] marriage is it you or your
[1:54:40] wife oh Lord I hope they say the right
[1:54:44] thing she comes
[1:54:49] first is that proper headship
[1:54:53] brother Steve is that right she comes
[1:54:56] first she comes before hunting she comes
[1:54:59] before fishing she comes before golfing
[1:55:02] or ball games her needs come before your
[1:55:07] needs I just tell on myself she knows
[1:55:10] I'll just tell on myself I wanted to go
[1:55:12] golfing this week Thursday was men's
[1:55:14] night I wanted to go

[1:55:35] important than my needs and I'm not
[1:55:38] lifting myself I'm Not tooting my own
[1:55:40] horn but I'm just saying sometimes we
[1:55:42] have to stop in
[1:55:44] process what is more important in a
[1:55:47] marriage what is more important is
[1:55:49] church more important than Sports
[1:55:53] is church more important than Social
[1:55:57] Hour is church more important than a
[1:55:59] family
[1:56:01] reunion now have we all
[1:56:05] failed sure we
[1:56:07] have but it's got to be a
[1:56:10] desire it's got to be a desire on the
[1:56:13] inside because that Spirit of unity
[1:56:15] that's taking place is changing amongst
[1:56:18] the people it's changing amongst the
[1:56:20] message it's changing in the secular
[1:56:22] world it's changing all around us I was
[1:56:24] talking to a a coworker of mine the
[1:56:26] other day about Worship in the
[1:56:29] church and we were talking he's a very
[1:56:31] educated brother he's a he's a he's a
[1:56:34] pharmacist and you know anybody that's
[1:56:36] been to school seven to eight years they
[1:56:39] they know a thing or two brother Josh
[1:56:40] because they've seen a thing or
[1:56:44] two and he's a pharmacist and we're
[1:56:47] we're talking and I said you know music
[1:56:49] has changed so much in the last few
[1:56:51] years
[1:56:53] and and I said people are graduating
[1:56:55] even around the message people are
[1:56:57] graduating away from the the hym
[1:57:00] books they're they're starting to to
[1:57:02] kind of get away from the hym books and
[1:57:04] I've been trying to figure this out but
[1:57:06] as you begin to watch and you begin to
[1:57:08] look and listen today's Music is More
[1:57:11] Christ centered it's more worship it's
[1:57:15] more praise it's more Victory with
[1:57:18] Christ in the center of
[1:57:20] it and and he agreed with me and he
[1:57:23] began to explain it to me this way now
[1:57:25] he he was a song leader he was in the
[1:57:27] UPC movement so he's been around a song
[1:57:30] or two and he said he and he explained
[1:57:32] it to me this way and it made so much
[1:57:34] sense he said listen he said years ago
[1:57:38] the music and the songs were
[1:57:41] horizontal they were about
[1:57:45] you they were about you think about it
[1:57:47] think about some of them old
[1:57:50] songs when we all get to
[1:57:53] heaven what a day that will
[1:57:56] be we can keep going on it's all
[1:57:58] centered about you it's horizontal
[1:57:59] you're not go you're just going on one
[1:58:01] level here he said but if you look and
[1:58:03] you listen to the songs today you'll
[1:58:06] find those songs are
[1:58:09] vertical they're connecting a
[1:58:12] people with God and God has now become
[1:58:17] the center of worship he's become the
[1:58:20] center of attention because there's a
[1:58:22] pool taking place and it's now you're
[1:58:24] connecting straight up and down with God
[1:58:27] and think about those songs that we sing
[1:58:29] now the new worship hymns the new songs
[1:58:31] that are sweeping it's about you and God
[1:58:35] and a relationship and a bride and a
[1:58:38] bridegroom and a
[1:58:40] return the church world didn't know a
[1:58:42] thing about a Rapture that's all they
[1:58:44] sing
[1:58:46] about why because it's a spirit of unity
[1:58:49] that's sweeping across the age here
[1:58:56] I'm G to find a place to
[1:59:02] stop this little
[1:59:05] girl just in the face of all of it he
[1:59:09] said upon the basis of his
[1:59:11] word that he would be back for
[1:59:15] her they got to
[1:59:18] laughing they put their hands around one
[1:59:21] another and danced around her can you
[1:59:24] imagine can you imagine the ridicu
[1:59:26] ridicule this young lady went
[1:59:28] through and she sing there and and they
[1:59:32] laughed and they said you poor silly
[1:59:36] kid and the prophet said she stood there
[1:59:39] without a blush in
[1:59:42] her you talk about knowing who you
[1:59:45] are you talk about believing in what you
[1:59:48] believe in you talk about living what
[1:59:51] you learn learned to live she stood
[1:59:54] there without a blush in her and she was
[1:59:56] holding her
[1:59:59] flowers standing there with her wedding
[2:00:01] garment all fixed
[2:00:03] up even though it was a struggle he said
[2:00:06] the bride had made herself ready and she
[2:00:09] kept holding her flowers and
[2:00:14] waiting they said I told you you was
[2:00:17] wrong he ain't coming
[2:00:22] I got five more
[2:00:24] minutes he'll be
[2:00:29] here you see we got to get such
[2:00:31] determination in our
[2:00:33] lives that no matter what happens hell
[2:00:36] or high water he's
[2:00:39] coming no matter what it takes for me to
[2:00:42] get myself ready no matter what I got to
[2:00:44] kick out of my house no matter what I
[2:00:45] got to change in my home no matter what
[2:00:47] I got to do in my daily living he's
[2:00:50] coming and I'm going to be ready
[2:00:54] they
[2:00:55] laughed and she said oh it's just about
[2:00:58] time and the old talk clock ticked five
[2:01:01] minutes and they heard the horses
[2:01:07] galloping and the sand rolling under the
[2:01:10] wheels and the old Buckboard stopped she
[2:01:12] jumped from between them out the door
[2:01:14] she went jumped into the carriage and
[2:01:16] flew into his
[2:01:18] arms now here's the other part of the
[2:01:20] story I didn't tell earlier
[2:01:23] she flew into the arms of her love and
[2:01:25] said I love you and you know what he
[2:01:27] said he said it's all over now
[2:01:31] honey it's all over now
[2:01:35] honey and left her little old cousin
[2:01:37] sitting
[2:01:39] there can you imagine the dumbfounded
[2:01:42] look on their face can you imagine the
[2:01:44] dumbfounded look on people's face when
[2:01:46] we just all turn up
