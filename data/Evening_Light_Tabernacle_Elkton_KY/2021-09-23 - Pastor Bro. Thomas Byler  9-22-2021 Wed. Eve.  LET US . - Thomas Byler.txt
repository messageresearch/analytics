i've been looking forward to wednesday for a long time amen praise god god is good isn't he everybody having a good week everybody happy oh that's good amen let's just bow our heads and go before the lord kind of heavenly father we come before you again once again lord thankful to be able to send assemble together lord jesus with your children father and knowing god that you're being in our midst as according as you have promised wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you will be in our midst lord father we just think about where we would be if you would have lifted the holy spirit from the earth already lord if you weren't here with us anymore lord how what a horrible thing that would be father so we're so grateful lord jesus to have you with us even in us to the end of the world we ask god that you just bless the meditation of our heart the thought which we feel like you've laid upon our heart to speak on we ask god that you just take control of my heart my lips my mind my thought and just say the things that you once said lord and help us father just be in your perfect will father both in the speaker and in the ears of the year we invite your presence here in a special way tonight god that you would just have your way draw us closer to your lord and help us to go out those doors different than what we came lord make a difference in our life lord bless your word now father as we open it inspire it to us father that we might understand it with our heart in jesus name we ask it amen and amen amen so i want to speak on another thought that i spoke uh told you i wanted to speak on he meant something that it's just real kind of different but amen it's just what i felt like it was law known to my heart so that's what we'll do is that okay and we'll turn to i think we'll go first to the old testament this this came to my mind whenever i begin to think about this this thought this this little story came to my mind and i thought it was good so we'll start with second kings i'm gonna put this down lower so it doesn't poof like that all right second king seven uh three through nine now just to lay up you don't have to read it just yet but let me lay out a little bit of a thought here the king i believe of syria had surrounded samaria and they were inside of the city all walled up and they were in great distress they were running out of food they were starving them out the syrians had plenty but the israelites didn't have hardly anything to eat at one point the king went walking by the wall and the woman calls out to him and he wanted some justice i guess and and she was saying help me help me and so forth and says what do you want me to help you with well she said that she had made this agreement with this one woman they both had babies and these uh the one woman says look let's uh kill your baby today and boil it need it and then tomorrow we'll kill mine so the one woman did she killed her child and they ate it and uh come the next day the other one hit it you know and so this is what this woman was wanting wanting the king to find his baby so this is kind of the stress situation that they were in it was an entire situation amen and so but you know elijah had prophesied he had prophesied that tomorrow i mean you're going to be eating good it's going to to put it in us other words he says you're going to it's going to be there's going to be plenty there and the king didn't believe it and says only if god opened the windows of heaven would anything like this happen and then elisha prophesied well you're going to see it but you're not going to partake of it and the next day when it all happened he was ran over by the crowd amen and killed i mean right about the time that he saw but just before all that happened and after the prophecy was made there was four lepers in chapter seven and verse three it says and there was four lepers leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into this city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit here still here we die also now therefore come and let us amen let us fall into the hosts of the syrians amen if they save us alive we will live and if they kill us well we shall but die amen said they don't they knew they didn't have much of an option right but they made a decision here they made a choice right and this word uh let i want to talk about that for a little bit just let word here in a minute but we shall live and if they shall kill us we shall die and they rush up rose up in the twilight i guess just before daylight to go into the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the other most parts of the camp at the syrians behold there was no man there for the lord had made the host of the experience to hear a noise how many remembers i always say god can control your mind he can control your ears amen and so god was controlling their minds he was controlling their ears and to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses you and i can only imagine what this sound sounded like to scare the liver so to speak out of this camp of syrians right until this is what they did even the noise of a great hosts and they said one to another lord the king of israel has hired us the has hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us wherefore they also they they arose and fled into twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life like i said it really scared them because they didn't take nothing with them yeah and when these lepers came to the utmost parts of the camp they went in tent and did eat and drink and carry thin silver and gold and raymond and when did hit it these guys were having a blast let's go hide this stuff all right oh my you come again and and went and hit it and come again and entered into another tent and carried things also went and hit it we're gonna be poor no more folks right my what a blessing just for the choice they made right they made a choice and they got blessed for it amen then say what's then said they one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and if we hold our peace if we carry till the morning in other words if we're too greedy here some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight amen so we find out there that of course he went he told the king and the king wouldn't believe it he just believed that they made it look like that they were just you know running away and so forth and some of his counselors convinced him to take about five of the horses that they had and to go out and find out if it was so as they had said and of course it was amen god had driven the enemy plum out of the out of out of the country so to speak and they went and they had plenty of everything based on the fact that these uh you know the messengers told them now look back at these lepers these lepers made a choice amen we want to look at that word tonight with the help of the lord let us let us over in isaiah i'm going to just go to isaiah for a minute but in isaiah 1 and verse 18 he says come god says to us come now and let us read it together saith the lord though your sins be a scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool this is one place that god invites us to come and to reason together i believe the brother man features a message called conferences how that god wants to have a conference with us amen how many how many believe that god wants to have a conference with all of humanity he invites us to come to him amen so i begin to look at this word let us amen in other words let's let us do this or let's do that or uh let's not you know in many many places it says uh you know for you to not to do certain things then it says let's provoke one another to love it let's do something it ties us up to something amen to a decision that's been made all right so this word let's ties us to a decision that's been made you're not in limbo anymore you're not thinking well am i going to do isn't this or am i how many knows that's a terrible place to be you know you know it's not really a good place where you really don't know which direction that you're going to go what you're going to do right but when they said let's how many the decision had been made a decision had been made they're going to do something something's fixing to happen when somebody is fixing the when that word let come on let's let it be done amen so i've tied it even that word kind of to me it ties in with and it's just me but it ties in with the word amen [Music] amen amen how many knows that what amen means what sophia and the kings used to say so let it be done all right so let it be written so let it be done amen sophia amen so you say amen it's the finality it's something that's rock solid it's something that's sure am it so we look at that word and it has in all the way to me it says so it's an absolute we know that god's word is an absolute amen and i believe that's i believe it's time and even our prophet talked about how that in the age that we're living in and now that jesus has come and done what he did he says the decision is forced upon people in other words you have to make a choice in other words you have to make a judgment it is this christ is not christ just what is it the degeneration was forced to make a decision amen are you gonna believe it or are you not gonna believe it amen but i like it because listen it shows something a forward motion that something's happening amen now here amen god invites us let's read it let us i like the word us you know because it's more than one how many just likes to be all alone i don't know anybody likes to be all alone and i think when it comes to this us it's a particular group of people it can be one more or it can be a thousand more it's us us can apply to one or a thousand and how many knows that when there's one that can chase a thousand then two can chase ten thousand right it's strength how many knows when there's one of us it's a certain strike when there's two of us there's more strength and what about a three-fourth cove three-fold cord how many knows the three-fold cord is not easily broken it's not easily broken so the more that you have the more strength you have but it talks about you know he says let him that cometh let it land whosoever will let him that come you know let him come but here when he talks about us he's talking about more than one person and we're just going to go through some scriptures tonight with the help of the lord and some of the scriptures that he talks about the new testament about let us as a group of people amen that's what we have tonight right we got a group of people let us amen let's do something amen let us you know because somebody knows that god says that let us reason together and the bible talks another place and i'll just read one more scripture to try to bring out what i want to say here but in hebrews the 12th chapter it says wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience success the race has set before us amen i say that this generation and every individual watch as a group we need to have a conference with god we need to have a good fashion talk old-fashioned talk with god amen because we are running a race how much we're running a race and you better you better have some wisdom about you to go through this life's journey amen i'm going to slow down here a little bit you know i was driving i was driving up north to junior's land the other day and uh here comes a funeral procession right and uh of course you pull over to the side right you're respectful and you know you go down through there and you're sitting there and you you know you think a little bit i thought you know you know you're sold another 10 15 years if you lived through all of that they're going to have a funeral procession for you i thought man that's scary i don't care who you are you know because my by the day was my 50s it went really fast if my 60s go that fast you know you better be thinking about your funeral procession right you better think about it because it ain't going to be long folks how many knows you don't have no you don't have no promise of making there's a lot of our friends people sitting here didn't make it through the 50s cancer and everything else we have no problems to make it 360. we have no promise of making in another decade so you better look at what you're doing we better i want to run this race amen looking to the author and the finisher of our faith if we're going to do something i like let us do this and let us not do that amen because it shows that there's something that you and i are supposed to do now because how many knows that god has already done his part this this brings out to me that god has already done his part when he said it is finished on calvary the work was done brother branham kevin said if jesus was standing right here in my suit and he was i believe he's filled with the holy ghost he was standing in his suit there's not anything that he could do for you you might say oh he owe me jesus email me jesus what did brother man say that he would say he says i can't i can't because i already did huh because so how many believes that god has already done his now let us do our part how many is with me now let's do our part now it's up to us what will we do what choice will we make i love it because you know it's glorious when somebody makes a choice makes a decision make a decision everybody has to make a decision sooner or later right i like it and and and on this place in this plateau in this place of decision before you can say well let's do this before you can say that you have to decide what you're going to do i mean as you don't just go do stuff without thinking about it without praying about it and also it's the most critical most crucial craziest place on earth that's right because how many has heard uh about this young abby girl that's just you know they're looking for everywhere and a boyfriend and all the little journey that went on to and she's been murdered somebody had to make a choice to do that you know when they had their fights and their buses and everything else he had to make a choice that's why it's a crazy place it's a crazy place it's a very dangerous place amen because and it's also on the opposite side of the coin it's also the greatest place you can imagine if the right decision is made if the right choice is made you go in the right direction and you decide to do the right thing it's a glorious place because it'll bring peace in your mind folks i was thinking about the other day he says you know you don't know how much it's worth for you to have peace in your mind and peace in your heart and peace in your soul and you can only have that through christ by the holy ghost that's the only place you can have peace like a river peace like a river or you'll have absolute hell in your mind and in your life if you make the wrong choice if you go the wrong way jesus said one place he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in god you believe in me amen i came to give you peace he says so you said in a couple places let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid amen i like that don't let it be afraid don't let it do that amen and you can only do that through christ jesus amen so we see here let's just go on here because i believe that it's a time but in sisters that you and i we are reaching for higher heights is that right deeper depth well how does that song go it just comes from a higher higher still amen and deeper higher deeper in the love of jesus praise the lord and you have to make a choice that you're going to go in that direction when we talk as a group as we talk as a church group here amen we want to say look let us paul was saying let us in other places he says to the saints in our philippi to the saints and they're here i believe here that he wasn't talking about amen the sinners i believe he's talking to believers don't you he was talking the people had already begun to race who had been born again and he's trying to say look let us go let's run let's finish this the right way are you with me tonight let's finish let's do this let's run this race let's finish this course let's lay aside every weight because what does that weight do what does that sin do that so easily drags you down how many knows it's so easy to get your mind off somewhere else by the time sunday night amen by sunday come come wednesday night or whatever you have this weight on you again it's hard for you to sing hard for you to praise god paul said let's lay aside every way let us lay aside every weight every sin that does so easily beside us so that we can run this race with patience the race that set before us because he said look see look at all the witnesses that we are compass with we won't go into that because i want to talk about some of these things the scripture talk about that we're to do amen but we see how that are the witnesses they have so many have done it amen all right so he says let us run this with patience that said before looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who was set down for the joy of set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of almighty god so brothers and sisters i'm here to say let us run and let us lay aside anything that hurts your relationship with the lord jesus christ anything your christian walk i heard brother branstad what the other day he was preaching he said you know i don't care how big how strong how much skiller you are how much of a he-man you are whatever make me think of arnold schwarzenegger and and some of them big movie stars or whatever look at him today he says he's one of these days probably god says you want to these days you'll frill up and die [Applause] that's exactly what they're doing they're traveling up and they're gonna die here we have no continuing city all of this mortality when you come down to the door of your death it isn't gonna mean anything to you the only thing we have to do is try to make ourselves as comfortable as we can isn't that right with our natural with our money and the things that we do but folks that's not our goal that's not what we're looking at that's not we're focused on amen paul is saying keep your eyes keep your eyes on the race let's finish it amen over another scripture i believe it's in hebrews 6. in hebrews 6 he says therefore amen therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of christ let us go on unto perfection amen let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance of dead works and a faith towards god in other words you shouldn't have to be repenting all the time oh i gotta repent again i gotta repent again we gotta no we wanna come up a little higher we don't wanna keep laying the foundation all the time we wanna build on higher things isn't that right amen praise the lord i'm glad to be higher than that aren't you yeah yeah a lot of i thought about this you know let's not make the mistakes that we have made in the past or our parents have made in the past or our friends or relatives have made in the past or we have made in the past let's not stay down there in the you know the dead works of repentance but let's go a little higher he said let us go on unto perfection amen unto i believe in ephesians 3 talk about the 5 folk ministry for the perfecting of the sake for saints and for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ until we all come into the full stature of christ unto the statue of by a perfect man how many wants to go on to be perfectly in christ so paul is saying let's go on let's go amen let's go let's go amen i like that word let's go go on let's go on unto perfection don't stay in the same place oh god won't let you stay in the same place what is it i i could show you many quotes brother the church doesn't never stay in the same place they're always going forward forward and forward and forward amen how many believes in going forward let us go on unto perfection over in philippians is another one in philippians 3 and verse 12 paul says not as though i had already attained either were already perfect so paul says i'm not even perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which i also am apprehended of jesus christ brother i count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before hello how many knows brother bam said that for the unbeliever the worst nightmares you could ever imagine is the worst time ever for the unbeliever out there there is no forward there is no future for the unbeliever but for us what's before i'll tell you i was coming to church tonight and i thought you know the less i would think of the politics and everything that's just kind of it needs to just kind of fade away you know just don't worry about that anymore don't worry don't worry it's not going to get any better right so don't worry just don't worry about focus on what's ahead for us that's what paul's saying here look at what's ahead for us look what's past that last breath i mean i don't look at the funeral position i look at that last breath and what's over on that other side saying lord i know that it's you know it's a terrible river to have to cross but with christ it don't have to be so terrible i'm thankful that i have somebody that across should help me cross that river amen praise the lord amen all right i'll i have something that happened funny but i'm not here to tell jokes maybe some time i'll tell you on the side but i told my wife on the way to church but anyway and that's why i'm kind of grinning because of that but anyway so anyway so paul says here notice here he says those things which are behind but reaching forth unto those who are before he said for i pressed hearts to mark for the prize of the high calling of god folks those lepers they had gold and silver and they went and dug them some holes and they had them a good time but let me tell you something how many of us are gold is a christ-like character our gold is heaven amen yeah we decide we have decided like we said i have decided to follow jesus there's no turning back no turning back don't go with me yet still will i follow you've made that choice you've made that decision you're going with christ no matter what another place he talks about i believe the song says you know if my brother don't go don't hinder me if my sister don't go don't hinder me i'm on my way praise god i'm on my way we're pressing towers to mark for the prize of the high calling of god which is what eternal life how many knows that's the prize is eternal life our reward is eternal life because if this life is all you have folks it's certainly not much not much but eternal life high calling in christ jesus that's our goal let us let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded amen keep your mind on the end think about what you're going to do when you come down to the door of death we don't know it might linger another 10 15 years we haven't got a clue isn't it something our brother brown thought he would be in 77 but then back later on he says you know i don't care i don't know if it's 20 years 30 years 50 years 100 years a thousand i don't know he said he didn't know because i'll tell you what he certainly didn't think we'd be in 2021 never seen us coming this far so what does that do for us who are here say lord help me to be ready lord help me to be ready let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything the uh if there be any other thing otherwise might god reveal it to us even unto us amen jesus said you know how many knows jesus said to be ready for you know not the day nor the hour that he is gonna come back we don't know when he's gonna come back so i say tonight let's get ready if you're not ready get ready right but it's best to be ready let's be ready for we don't know when he will come amen let's press target mark romans 13 and 12 says the night is far spent the day is at hand it is the rising of the sun how many they say but i'm remembering says you know it's just dark it's just before the light but he said it is the rising of the sun amen how many beliefs is the rising of the sun sure come forth with healings in his wings and so forth the night is far spent the day is at hand paul says let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light what is the armor of light love faith long suffering gentleness meekness temperance patience amen how many knows that when you're i'll tell you what i've said many times me and patients we just don't get along at all hey we have very little in common being patient see it's certainly something i and i'm sure you laughing like that you really have to work on that that's right you got to really work on patience amen i come up behind a big old string of cars going north and i'm like well i might as well slow down you know they're probably pretty they're a little below the speed limit but you know i'd have to go too fast or whatever i never make pass all of them and a big old truck pulled over in the side of the road people semi broke down right and then a little bit further up big old bus on the side of the road pulled over i'm like what's going on a little further a whole bunch of cars pulled over on the side of the road i'm like my goodness i could pass i wanna take and then the light came on you're following a funeral procession that's why everybody fell over you know common sense right yeah it was anyway i was like well i need patience lord help me right my wife said you know what would you have done if you went by them you know you would have where do you pull off with a bit put his eyes up idiot oh yeah we need patience though amen but think about it that's right you know cast off all the darkness how many wants to be that lord help me to take cast off everything in darkness in my life that everything that reflects when you're patient with me i'm patient with you we can see that in each other can we we can see that whenever we have have that i have love i believe we gotta have love don't you then it's also romans 13 13 says let us walk honestly amen so it says listen we have to let us cast off the darkness put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting in drunkenness not in chamber chambering and wanting us not in strife and enemy amen how many believes that then also it says romans 14 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another how many believes eternal life is living for others so it says let us follow after the things which make for peace and the things where one may edify another galatian 6 9 says let us not amen be weary in well-doing don't get tired of your christian walk and serving the lord because it says for in due season you shall reap if we faint not how many believes it's really something you have to work on and it says as we have opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them that are of the household of faith how many believes that we all ought to always be looking for something in good that we can do for one another i believe that that's what he said look always look for an opportunity to do something good one for another amen so listen but ye brethren are not in darkness that that they should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the darkness therefore let us not sleep amen now how many knows even the prophet of god says you know wake up pentecost wake up churches wake up people wake up why because they were spiritually huh they were spiritually sleeping not aware of what's really going on too caught up with the things of the world the things of the world will make you droggy it'll make you sleepy just the cares of life what can make you droggy and sleepy before you know it you have no fresh revelation anymore you don't hear the voice of god that sweetness isn't there anymore because you're so busy taking care of things amen so it says don't sleep amen we're not children of the night but we're children of the day but let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be soper amen first timothy 6 6 says but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and is certainly and it is certain that we can carry nothing out amen you came into this world naked you'll leave with a suit of clothes and probably your shoes off i don't think they put shoes on people you might have socks pair of pants suit coat your hair that's what you get to take with you getting stuff right but that's what you get to take with you outside of christ but with christ you have something that's eternal and i'm glad for that let's say thank you lord jesus for giving me something more than a pair of socks a pair of clothes to take with me i can take something that's eternal of eternal weight amen but it says paul says tells us to be content with such things that we have and having food and raiment let us be there with content content isn't that a sweet word content happy not a baby screaming and hollering but a baby on a bottle on mama's breast as happiness can be content contentment amen how many believes that's what it ought to be and listen also let us hold fast our profession of faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another how many beliefs we need to can be considerate of one another hey you wouldn't have to he could say you know it would be a different word but let us as a group when you have more than one you always have to be considerate of the other person right we who are married have learned that if you haven't you're still in for a really really strong lesson yeah if you haven't learned that already how to be considerate of your wife or of your husband amen now notice let us consider one another and i like this word to provoke huh provoke now i don't know the exact i didn't look up the meaning but irritate perhaps or prod or push we know that when you provoke somebody to anger well we know what you're what that's all about right but this is let us provoke one another unto love and good works huh somebody does something maybe a little now brother you know you shouldn't do that now you know you shouldn't have scolded them or you know you should have been considered provoke one another to love push one another to love and to good works that right that's what paul said that we were to provoke one another to love and to good works amen last of all let us be glad and rejoice for the gift and give him honor give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready aren't you glad that let us be glad and rejoice how many believes christians sometimes we have a long face but we ought to still have joy in our heart we ought to come to church every time with a boom long face why let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him amen how many believes all on are all glory goes to christ jesus none of us seeks honor only we honor when honor him he is worthy of all honor all praise all glory all respect amen so let's do that god bless you if you will stand with me tonight another place that says let us go forth without the camp bearing his reproach in other words let's go beyond the camp of what the world is like don't have to be like everybody else right somebody wants to call you old-fashioned let them call you old fash or you're just one of them christian yeah go ahead and call me whatever you want i'm very proud or very humbled to be able to be a christian amen very glad to be a christian i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ i'm very glad to be a christian but we go without the camp to suffer his reproach if it's a reproach to serve the lord or to be a christian and that we don't have a problem with that he was put without the camp too wasn't he that's our heads how many have a desire just to go on to go further to go deeper to go you know to run this race let us run this wraith with patience assets that's set before us just raise this before us and let us go to perfection how many wants to go there let me come perfectly into christ lord we come before you now you see the hands that are up lord we pray god that you'd help us to lay aside the principles the the foundation of it all and

it's more more in the stature of christ lord jesus may people be able to see the full stature of christ lord we know father like paul we don't say that we've gotten there but we're not looking to the past we're not looking at what we have been but we're looking at what you want us to be in the future help us to press on to the mark for the prize of the high calling in christ jesus forgive us all of all our sins lord our failures and where we're still not what we want to be lord or should be father but we ask god that you'd help us lord to attain to what you want us to be father lord bless
