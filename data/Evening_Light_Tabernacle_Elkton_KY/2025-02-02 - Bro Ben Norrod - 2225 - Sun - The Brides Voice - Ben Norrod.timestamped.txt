[1:11:49] God glory to
[1:11:53] God oh thank you Lord thank you
[1:11:56] Lord thank you Sam appreciate you girl
[1:11:59] if you got your Bible Hebrews chapter
[1:12:01] 4:14 let's jump right into the word of
[1:12:03] the Lord everybody happy amen thank you
[1:12:06] Lord Jesus for the truth of his word can
[1:12:09] you say Amen to that how great he is to
[1:12:13] us the Lord helping us this morning I
[1:12:15] want to speak to you upon the bride's
[1:12:18] voice the bride's
[1:12:20] voice and um it was a blessing to hear
[1:12:24] Brother Tom say that he' been speaking
[1:12:26] in this direction because you know
[1:12:28] that's kind of the direction I'm going
[1:12:30] to be heading just a little bit but um I
[1:12:33] am connected to y'all and I do stay
[1:12:35] connected but you know if I know that
[1:12:37] I'm going to be coming and preaching
[1:12:38] anywhere I try not to listen to any
[1:12:40] sermons for months ahead and uh that way
[1:12:43] I can be led by the Lord and uh you know
[1:12:46] and not be U particularly influenced not
[1:12:49] necessarily negative but just influenced
[1:12:51] in general and uh so when I was sitting
[1:12:54] in the office and I heard him talking
[1:12:55] about the confession and things like
[1:12:57] that I thought thank you Jesus you
[1:12:59] always know how to lead a person so
[1:13:02] we're going to go to Hebrews 4
[1:13:04] ver14 and then um we're going to jump
[1:13:07] over to revelation 22 but let's let's
[1:13:10] start here the book of Hebrews seeing
[1:13:12] then that we have a great high priest
[1:13:14] that has passed into the heavens Jesus
[1:13:17] the son of God let us hold fast our
[1:13:21] profession for we have not a high priest
[1:13:24] which cannot be touched touched with the
[1:13:25] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[1:13:28] all points tempted like as we are yet
[1:13:31] without sin Let Us therefore come boldly
[1:13:36] unto the throne of
[1:13:38] grace now I I don't know about you but
[1:13:41] that's going to be a challenging thing
[1:13:43] for me to do if if I don't have a
[1:13:47] revelation of who I am where I'm
[1:13:50] standing or why I'm even standing there
[1:13:52] in the first place could you imagine
[1:13:54] coming up in the face of a holy God
[1:13:55] looking him eyeball to eyeball and then
[1:13:57] making some kind of a bold statement or
[1:13:59] bold challenge to a god like that you'd
[1:14:02] have to know a whole lot more about
[1:14:03] where you're standing to be able to do
[1:14:05] such a thing and then he said that we
[1:14:08] stand there looking to do what obtain
[1:14:11] mercy and find Grace to help in the time
[1:14:15] of need praise the Lord now let's uh
[1:14:18] let's go to revelation 22 I want to look
[1:14:20] at just a portion of verse 17 and then
[1:14:22] let's pray and ask the Lord to help us
[1:14:29] how good it is to be in the house of God
[1:14:32] today telling you to be a Christian is
[1:14:34] the Most Blessed thing a person could
[1:14:37] want I certainly love how I feel when I
[1:14:40] get to worship Him and talk to him a
[1:14:41] little while read his word it does
[1:14:44] everything for me all right revelation
[1:14:46] 22 verse1 17 and the spirit and the
[1:14:50] bride say come I want you to repeat that
[1:14:54] with me and the spirit and the bride say
[1:14:58] come let's pray over the word while your
[1:15:00] heads are bowed this morning if You'
[1:15:01] just like to be remembered in prayer
[1:15:03] some special need in your heart that
[1:15:04] you'd like from the word would you just
[1:15:06] lift your hand up to the Lord Jesus amen
[1:15:09] my hands up too Heavenly Father what a
[1:15:11] privilege it is Lord to come into your
[1:15:13] house today we count this not only a a
[1:15:16] grand privilege Lord but we considered
[1:15:19] also a sense of Duty to be here in this
[1:15:22] place Lord is part of our position our
[1:15:25] adoption not just wandering aimlessly
[1:15:28] with The Mark of Cain on us as a
[1:15:29] vagabond but having a post having a home
[1:15:32] having a place a rank we thank you Lord
[1:15:35] for being able to come and be able to
[1:15:37] offer our our our gifts and our
[1:15:40] abilities and things that you've placed
[1:15:42] in us to contribute to the worship to
[1:15:44] corporate worship and to bring us into
[1:15:46] the atmosphere that we could hear from
[1:15:48] you and I pray that you'll not only use
[1:15:50] each one of these gifts that are
[1:15:52] gathered here today but Lord I ask that
[1:15:54] you would anoint this little deposit of
[1:15:56] yourself and me that you had just allow
[1:15:58] it to work in the proper manner to get
[1:16:00] me out of the way that I could be a
[1:16:02] voice to speak to them what you would
[1:16:05] desire what you would be thinking and
[1:16:07] what you would have in your great heart
[1:16:09] and I pray this morning that not only
[1:16:11] will you bless Lord our little
[1:16:14] contributions as brother Bram called it
[1:16:16] our little licks of fire but Lord Jesus
[1:16:18] anoint us to receive from your engrafted
[1:16:21] word those things which we have need of
[1:16:23] to get closer to you May the Holy Spirit
[1:16:26] I pray bless every uplifted hand Lord
[1:16:29] May the Holy Spirit go down through this
[1:16:31] congregation today and may you grant
[1:16:33] great favor grace and mercy to all of us
[1:16:36] as we ask for these things Lord in the
[1:16:38] name of Jesus Christ and the Saints said
[1:16:40] amen and amen you can be seated may the
[1:16:43] Lord bless you really
[1:16:45] good amen it's a a grand privilege to
[1:16:49] read the Bible isn't it love the word of
[1:16:52] God and certainly love this book of
[1:16:54] Hebrews it's um been something that
[1:16:57] we've been studying at the uh home
[1:17:00] Church we've been doing kind of a a
[1:17:02] study with the entire uh assembly and uh
[1:17:05] just on Wednesday nights we've uh had
[1:17:07] canceled the Wednesday nights for a
[1:17:08] period of time during the uh uh the fall
[1:17:12] and uh we're getting ready to resume our
[1:17:13] Wednesdays coming up here in just a
[1:17:14] little bit but as a supplement we've
[1:17:17] been working on uh Wednesdays with
[1:17:19] pastor and and uh the Hebrew series and
[1:17:22] just kind of at home we're all studying
[1:17:24] and going around around this book and I
[1:17:26] found it profound that uh you know it
[1:17:30] was profound to me that when I got to
[1:17:32] looking at this particular book I had
[1:17:35] always heard the challenge made out of
[1:17:37] Hebrews 1 that you know that it was
[1:17:39] proof God and Sury times divers manners
[1:17:42] spake unto the fathers by the prophet uh
[1:17:44] prophets but in the last days has spoke
[1:17:46] to us by his son they used that many
[1:17:48] times as proof critics do uh they're not
[1:17:50] being any profit whatsoever and so as I
[1:17:53] begin to kind of study into this book it
[1:17:55] it it it dawned on me the other day well
[1:17:57] my goodness this was a prophet writing
[1:18:00] about that particular event so if you
[1:18:02] didn't believe in prophets he would have
[1:18:03] had to denounce himself at the beginning
[1:18:05] of the writing and so looking at this
[1:18:08] particular chapter we're in do you get a
[1:18:11] little bit of a background on why we're
[1:18:13] here and why we're in this particular
[1:18:14] place Paul according to the historians
[1:18:17] and different biblical theologians and
[1:18:20] Scholars alike they all agree upon one
[1:18:23] thing that Paul was either dealing with
[1:18:24] one of two classes of people or perhaps
[1:18:26] two classes that it was either Jews that
[1:18:29] had backslidden from Judaism and uh he
[1:18:33] was trying to win them into uh back into
[1:18:36] Judaism and then to bring them up into
[1:18:38] Christianity or it was Jews that were
[1:18:41] already presently devout and Pious and
[1:18:44] things like that and he was trying to
[1:18:46] bring them up into Christianity and then
[1:18:47] another fellow said that possibly this
[1:18:50] was people that had already become
[1:18:52] Christians so-called at one point and
[1:18:54] had back Sliding Away and Paul was
[1:18:56] trying to drag him back in by hook or by
[1:18:59] Crook in every way he possibly could
[1:19:01] amen because when you read this book of
[1:19:03] Hebrews he wasn't nice this was not a
[1:19:05] nice book for those that didn't believe
[1:19:08] in Jesus Christ as the Messiah he just
[1:19:10] starts hammering them right off the bat
[1:19:12] and all of their traditions and their
[1:19:14] pots and their pans and their keeping of
[1:19:15] feast days was just nonsense in the eyes
[1:19:18] of God this was a pretty tough book when
[1:19:20] Paul begin to lay it down and then of
[1:19:23] course as he breaks into each of the
[1:19:25] chapters he starts out showing us that
[1:19:28] God had in the past spoke to us by
[1:19:31] prophets but in the last days was
[1:19:33] speaking to us by his son and as he
[1:19:36] breaks into that a little bit he begins
[1:19:39] to show us how that Not only was the
[1:19:42] Holy Spirit basically the mouthpiece for
[1:19:46] the age and the mouthpiece for the next
[1:19:49] 2,000 years or ever how long this age
[1:19:51] will go Not only was Jesus speaking
[1:19:53] directly to to us but then he breaks
[1:19:56] into it a little bit later how that all
[1:19:58] of the ministry the uh saints of God the
[1:20:02] body of Christ and what more are
[1:20:04] becoming not only God's hands and feet
[1:20:06] and eyes and whatever more but also they
[1:20:10] are becoming God's voice to the people
[1:20:13] in the outside world so it wasn't that
[1:20:15] God was just speaking through Jesus
[1:20:18] Christ just independently just the man
[1:20:21] Jesus himself but Paul was trying to
[1:20:23] show them that The God Who was above
[1:20:26] them all those years that they worshiped
[1:20:28] according to the Tabernacle in the
[1:20:30] wilderness and according to the temple
[1:20:32] as it was erected and the Ark of the
[1:20:34] Covenant being set there with those
[1:20:36] cherubims and the light of God hanging
[1:20:38] in between there amen that God above
[1:20:41] them became god with them in the form of
[1:20:44] Jesus Emmanuel but then he had to take
[1:20:46] them on to the stage that now it's not
[1:20:48] just God above us God with us but now
[1:20:51] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] that same Jesus Jesus Christ was now
[1:20:56] living in every member of the body of
[1:20:58] Jesus Christ now you imagine what kind
[1:21:01] of a rude awakening that was to a bunch
[1:21:02] of Jews that had never really probably
[1:21:05] ever seen much spiritual in their entire
[1:21:07] lives they had done routines they had
[1:21:09] obeyed the prophet's quotes they had
[1:21:11] went to church paid their tithes they
[1:21:13] had dressed like they were supposed to
[1:21:15] and done all of the appropriate
[1:21:16] behaviors that was expected of them and
[1:21:19] yet nothing really spiritual had
[1:21:22] happened in many of their hearts we know
[1:21:23] that's right because God had told him
[1:21:25] right up to the very end your feast days
[1:21:28] and all that you're doing are becoming
[1:21:30] nothing but a stink in my nostrils you
[1:21:32] know I wonder friends and I don't say
[1:21:34] this in a critical manner but I wonder
[1:21:36] how quickly we're arriving at that same
[1:21:38] spot around the ranks of this message
[1:21:40] that we have learned how to do and to
[1:21:43] tow the line and to behave according to
[1:21:45] the rule book that we would think of as
[1:21:48] being the message rule book of how we're
[1:21:50] supposed to live and how we're supposed
[1:21:51] to be taught and how we're supposed to
[1:21:53] act and beh
[1:21:55] but I wonder is it become is it just a
[1:21:57] routine to us that when we worship God
[1:22:00] we always worship God in a certain mode
[1:22:02] in a certain way of doing things you
[1:22:04] know I tell people sometimes if you find
[1:22:06] yourself getting in a rut and you know
[1:22:08] coming to church and you're always doing
[1:22:10] the same thing if you always raise up
[1:22:11] your left hand just pick a KN and raise
[1:22:13] up your right one instead if you're
[1:22:15] somebody hollering amen amen amen holler
[1:22:17] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just do
[1:22:19] something to keep it broke up Amen to
[1:22:21] keep from getting into that religious
[1:22:23] rut you know what I'm saying understand
[1:22:25] that routine of things where we do this
[1:22:27] all the same way this is my Pew this is
[1:22:30] my time that's my parking spot on and on
[1:22:33] and on you see God does not want us
[1:22:35] living our life amen as a group of
[1:22:38] people that have practiced routines and
[1:22:41] ceremonies and rituals down to where we
[1:22:44] know the very minutest of the law and
[1:22:46] know everything that brother Bram said
[1:22:49] but God wants us to be a living voice to
[1:22:53] all of us around amen the cner the saint
[1:22:56] ever who they are to be a voice living
[1:22:59] and exercised before the world Amen I
[1:23:02] find that if we don't realize the power
[1:23:05] of our voice I I fear and I know that
[1:23:09] God Amen is not going to allowed to be
[1:23:11] this way but you know as a leader you
[1:23:12] look around sometimes and you wonder if
[1:23:14] we go another 30 years what's this
[1:23:16] message going to look like the people
[1:23:18] have slipped so far away from Holiness
[1:23:20] in general and the righteous things of
[1:23:22] God Amen and they just keep slipping
[1:23:24] further and further into denominational
[1:23:27] type of ways and doing things in a
[1:23:29] denominational
[1:23:30] mindset you say they don't do it around
[1:23:32] the message sure they do how many people
[1:23:34] do you know that say if you believe
[1:23:35] brother R's a prophet you got it that
[1:23:37] ain't nothing but a Baptist that slipped
[1:23:39] in the back
[1:23:40] door how many people do you know that
[1:23:42] say well if you go Shout at the altar
[1:23:44] God will do something great if you'll
[1:23:45] just shout and rejoice and have an
[1:23:48] experience that's the same thing as a
[1:23:50] Pentecostal that slipped in the back
[1:23:51] door well Hallelujah all these
[1:23:55] Traditions will slip right underneath
[1:23:57] the seam amen get right into the door
[1:23:59] and before we know it we'll be
[1:24:01] infiltrated with one denominational idea
[1:24:03] after another don't think it's strange
[1:24:06] that the devil doesn't want that brother
[1:24:09] B already told us in the church Shades
[1:24:10] book that his great desire was to get
[1:24:13] into the church to luk make it to defile
[1:24:15] it making it lukewarm formal and
[1:24:20] Powerless and the greatest way he can do
[1:24:23] that is to try to get you to believe a
[1:24:25] certain way as contrary to the word hold
[1:24:28] on to that idea or chase that idea
[1:24:30] without taking that thing back to the
[1:24:32] Bible to make sure it's absolutely the
[1:24:34] truth or not people can sit right in
[1:24:36] church and have an idea completely
[1:24:37] contrary to the word and become a
[1:24:39] denomination under themselves and the
[1:24:42] Holy Ghost stops they can't he can't
[1:24:43] move he can't he can't act he can't do
[1:24:46] anything for them except for when
[1:24:48] they're repenting and getting their
[1:24:49] themselves straight with God Amen and
[1:24:52] people have fallen into this same idea
[1:24:55] that Paul was scolding them for in the
[1:24:57] book of Hebrews the washing of pots and
[1:24:59] pans keeping of certain days and and and
[1:25:03] and and certain moons and you know you
[1:25:05] watch people they get absolutely
[1:25:07] completely Bonkers if the moon turns
[1:25:10] red I know that there are signs in the
[1:25:12] heaven above but brother those things
[1:25:15] areen what we're looking for well every
[1:25:17] sign that we've ever needed to see has
[1:25:20] already been shown to this
[1:25:22] generation y'all getting quiet on me but
[1:25:25] that just eggs me on that much
[1:25:27] more you say oh you ought not be hard on
[1:25:29] them things why not people are slipping
[1:25:31] into spiritual Comas they wouldn't know
[1:25:35] spiritual things if it slapped them on
[1:25:36] the back of the head half of
[1:25:38] them they don't pray they don't study
[1:25:40] they don't read their Bible but they
[1:25:42] sure know what's expected of them when
[1:25:44] they come through those back doors they
[1:25:46] know what pudus it and they know how to
[1:25:47] behave in church they've got great
[1:25:49] church manners but how do we ever expect
[1:25:52] to become a voice until we lay aside
[1:25:55] tradition and start letting the Lord
[1:25:57] speak to us and through
[1:26:00] us because the message is not an
[1:26:04] organization it's an experience that we
[1:26:06] have with the man Jesus Christ himself
[1:26:09] and that experience ought to carry us
[1:26:11] into an entirely different dimension of
[1:26:13] thinking than the rest of the world woo
[1:26:16] come on the word's Amen in case you
[1:26:19] forgot right now watch now he says then
[1:26:23] we have a high priest passed into the
[1:26:25] heavens now now you can understand how
[1:26:28] almost Blasphemous this was to many Jews
[1:26:31] sitting there that knew the pedigree of
[1:26:35] Aaron and the bloodline of those priests
[1:26:38] they were so sacred and the the the
[1:26:41] bloodline was so
[1:26:43] protected they knew the scripture
[1:26:46] whenever those boys got into the into
[1:26:48] the uh door of the Tabernacle and
[1:26:50] committed adultery and how that God had
[1:26:51] smoted him and how that when when when
[1:26:53] Uzziah went in there with the sensor and
[1:26:55] got out of his position God had so
[1:26:57] protected that place of worship so they
[1:27:00] all knew the sacredness of it and now
[1:27:03] Paul was telling us that the greater
[1:27:06] Temple the greater the greater Sanctuary
[1:27:09] was being occupied by another high
[1:27:12] priest they didn't know his bloodline
[1:27:14] they didn't know his pedigree they
[1:27:16] didn't know nothing about this man last
[1:27:17] they heard about him he was just some
[1:27:19] kind of an adulterous fair with a ro
[1:27:21] Roman soldier that they tried to cover
[1:27:23] up something by making it spiritual and
[1:27:26] that Jesus was nothing but illegitimate
[1:27:30] born as a matter of fact they killed
[1:27:32] that man in our terms today they' have
[1:27:36] put him in the electric chair of the gas
[1:27:39] chamber capital punishment is how Jesus
[1:27:42] died imagine how the rest of the world
[1:27:45] looked at his death like that could you
[1:27:47] imagine going up to the the the prison
[1:27:49] house and watching them throw the switch
[1:27:51] on a guy and electrocute him to death
[1:27:55] and then three or 4 days later start
[1:27:56] running around telling everybody you
[1:27:57] seen him alive
[1:27:59] again they were absolutely insane to the
[1:28:03] world but you see that's the way God's
[1:28:05] always done things he's always hid
[1:28:08] himself in the ridiculous and the odd
[1:28:10] and the
[1:28:11] strange and he's relied upon faith in
[1:28:13] the hearts of people to see him for who
[1:28:16] he was didn't Jesus tell us the world
[1:28:18] won't see me again but you'll see
[1:28:21] me Glory
[1:28:25] and here Paul is positioning this man as
[1:28:28] a high priest of what your
[1:28:35] voice The Voice you
[1:28:39] use has a lot more power in it than what
[1:28:42] you even give it credit for yeah that's
[1:28:45] true for example they tell us
[1:28:48] that simply through what the world calls
[1:28:51] today positive affirmations
[1:28:54] these are just statements you say over
[1:28:55] and over and over again uh you know I am
[1:28:57] smart I am this I am that just positive
[1:29:00] things they've even proved that you can
[1:29:02] change your
[1:29:04] brain physiologically literally change
[1:29:06] your brain by the way that you speak
[1:29:09] things over and over and over again I
[1:29:11] always wonder how people were so easily
[1:29:13] negative it's because they practice
[1:29:15] it they practice being negative and
[1:29:17] their brain their body their C they've
[1:29:19] just done it so much it's like an
[1:29:20] Olympic Athlete trying to run down the
[1:29:22] mile run a mile he just boom he's gone
[1:29:26] some people move to the negative side
[1:29:29] because that's all they've ever put in
[1:29:31] here and in here right and boy we living
[1:29:35] in a day where it's hard to be
[1:29:38] positive it's okay you could say man you
[1:29:40] ain't going to scare
[1:29:43] me everywhere you look be at the news be
[1:29:47] it some media social media some kind of
[1:29:49] a thing all of that is negative
[1:29:54] I'm sure hoping this next four years
[1:29:55] gets a little brighter than it has
[1:29:59] been CU I mean brother everywhere you
[1:30:02] look some disaster is being spoke
[1:30:05] of some disease that's been broke on the
[1:30:09] people that they can't figure out the
[1:30:10] answer to when's the last time any of
[1:30:12] these newscasters CBN and uh CBS excuse
[1:30:16] me and MSNBC and fox and these guys ever
[1:30:18] got up and said now there's a case of
[1:30:20] bird flu out there but we just want to
[1:30:21] remind the American public that Jesus Is
[1:30:24] A
[1:30:26] Healer I never heard fouchy say that in
[1:30:28] all of his
[1:30:31] brains so smart he's absolutely an
[1:30:36] imbecile
[1:30:38] hello cuz real WIS wise people and
[1:30:41] people with wisdom know that all that
[1:30:43] the devil can do is put a sickness on
[1:30:46] you but God's the one that has taken it
[1:30:48] away by his stripes I am already healed
[1:30:55] glory and I don't have to wait on
[1:30:57] healing neither it's already
[1:30:59] here how am I going to understand the
[1:31:03] power of my
[1:31:05] voice if everything around me every
[1:31:08] voice around me is inputting into me
[1:31:11] constant
[1:31:12] negativity you see this is the reason
[1:31:14] why the Bible encourages Christians I
[1:31:18] don't want to use the word demands but
[1:31:19] really that's almost as strong as it
[1:31:21] needs to be it demands of us brother Jo
[1:31:24] just to completely separate from the
[1:31:26] world altoe you realize that doesn't
[1:31:28] mean just quit going to the barrooms and
[1:31:30] and things like that but separating from
[1:31:32] the world also means cutting off those
[1:31:34] voices that confuse your
[1:31:38] faith that's
[1:31:40] right how many of these things do we
[1:31:43] allow oursel to listen to be it radio
[1:31:45] programs and podcast and on and on and
[1:31:49] on that by the time we get done with it
[1:31:52] it is it is placed all kinds of
[1:31:54] interference into us just simply
[1:31:56] believing God for what we have to
[1:31:59] believe many many things out there will
[1:32:02] discourage your faith from believing
[1:32:05] that what the Bible says is true you
[1:32:08] take the society we live in you if
[1:32:10] there's never been a group that I am
[1:32:12] proud of but also feel sorry for it's
[1:32:13] our sisters having to live in a world
[1:32:15] where everybody around you's got cut
[1:32:17] hair and make up on britches and shorts
[1:32:19] and all those kind of things like that
[1:32:20] and then you come to one of these
[1:32:21] churches like this and they tell you
[1:32:23] women to dress
[1:32:24] different and it's almost like there's
[1:32:26] this disconnect between how that makes
[1:32:29] you feel when you leave these doors than
[1:32:30] being
[1:32:32] here it's almost like ah you just do it
[1:32:35] you're a sister just but do you
[1:32:36] understand Brothers do we will'll never
[1:32:38] understand the extent of the suffering
[1:32:40] and the torment and the torture that our
[1:32:42] sisters go through living in a society
[1:32:45] full of women that completely disobey
[1:32:48] the word of God every day of their life
[1:32:52] [Music]
[1:32:54] amen you say well I'm proud to be a
[1:32:56] woman in a Christian sure but brother
[1:32:58] Ram said that long hair on your head was
[1:33:00] also Christ's Crown of Thorns
[1:33:03] again it goes to prove the torture that
[1:33:06] comes the torment that
[1:33:08] comes from having to live in a world
[1:33:11] that to be so odd and so
[1:33:14] strange and you know how it is when
[1:33:16] these things get released out to the
[1:33:17] world and some years ago whenever the uh
[1:33:19] the John Collins thing and the
[1:33:21] Tabernacle started up with the believe
[1:33:22] the sign group and all that they got
[1:33:24] those little exerpts of brother brandham
[1:33:25] down in Louisville and he was saying
[1:33:27] about how women are dog meat for the way
[1:33:28] they dress and things and how some of
[1:33:30] them women when they flash them
[1:33:31] newscasters on there you could tell they
[1:33:33] were visibly
[1:33:35] offended not knowing why would any human
[1:33:38] being speak like that to a
[1:33:41] woman the challenge that lays before you
[1:33:44] is the same exact challenge that laid
[1:33:46] before these Hebrews when Paul starts
[1:33:47] writing these things in here are we
[1:33:49] willing to lay aside the trends of the
[1:33:52] entire world to follow Christ and to
[1:33:55] follow what's true or we going to get
[1:33:57] swept up in all of the other voices in
[1:33:59] the age that pull us in a certain
[1:34:00] direction really brother and sister it's
[1:34:02] up to us and you know preachers
[1:34:04] experience the same kind of pressure we
[1:34:06] hear the people under this and the
[1:34:07] people under that and if we're not
[1:34:08] careful breth and I think you we're not
[1:34:09] careful we'll start bending toward those
[1:34:11] things and easing toward an easier style
[1:34:13] of preaching and we'll get nicer and
[1:34:15] nicer and nicer until we'll quit
[1:34:17] preaching against sin all together then
[1:34:19] you know what happens that people get
[1:34:21] offended if you sniff your nose or you
[1:34:23] clear your throat while you're
[1:34:26] preaching tell me when we got so soft
[1:34:29] that we can't take good oldfashioned
[1:34:31] brass knuckles hard
[1:34:33] preaching why can't we we're the bride
[1:34:35] aren't we we're children of Truth aren't
[1:34:38] we shouldn't we be able to take the word
[1:34:39] as hard as it gets yes we should and yes
[1:34:43] we
[1:34:44] can cuz I want to hear what's right I
[1:34:46] want my soul to be right with God I want
[1:34:49] to know how to make the
[1:34:51] Rapture I don't want no man sh coed for
[1:34:54] me tell me the
[1:34:57] truth
[1:34:59] amen may not be as popular as the other
[1:35:02] guys are but I guarantee the man that's
[1:35:04] going to tell you the truth he'll get
[1:35:05] you in the right
[1:35:06] places thank God for brothers that are
[1:35:08] willing to do it to tell us it's
[1:35:11] right so here we see Paul establishing
[1:35:14] Jesus as a high priest I want you to
[1:35:16] notice now I love how he says this for
[1:35:20] we have not a high priest which cannot
[1:35:22] be touched with the feeling of our
[1:35:23] infirmity
[1:35:24] but in all points was tempted like we
[1:35:27] are yet without
[1:35:29] sin and then he says the very next line
[1:35:32] look at that verse 16 let us therefore
[1:35:34] come
[1:35:35] boldly good
[1:35:38] Lord that tells me that somewhere
[1:35:40] between that verse and that verse I must
[1:35:44] have got a revelation somewhere that not
[1:35:46] only am I forgiven and clean and I stand
[1:35:49] justified in his presence but that I
[1:35:51] have a right to come to him and speak
[1:35:53] boldly to him it it speaks to the
[1:35:57] relationship that the comer has with the
[1:35:59] one he's coming
[1:36:01] to amen How could a man walk up when the
[1:36:05] when the Great White Throne of judgment
[1:36:06] is set up the entire Heaven the Earth
[1:36:08] and everything flees from the face of
[1:36:11] him that sits on the
[1:36:13] throne and yet here Paul tells us when
[1:36:16] you come to that same Throne come
[1:36:20] boldly how could you have that much
[1:36:23] understanding and faith and confidence
[1:36:25] in your
[1:36:26] voice must be a revelation strike
[1:36:30] somewhere praise the Lord now watch this
[1:36:33] now in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:36:35] when brother talking about things like
[1:36:37] positive affirmations and what we would
[1:36:38] call today positive affirmation he said
[1:36:40] now remember it's not Christian Science
[1:36:42] mind over
[1:36:44] matter the mind accepts the life which
[1:36:47] is the word of God and that brings the
[1:36:49] life just your thought doesn't do it
[1:36:55] so being positive is great but it only
[1:36:58] works on certain Realms of you it will
[1:37:01] help you have a better day it'll help
[1:37:03] you have more confidence in yourself
[1:37:05] perhaps maybe give you more courage
[1:37:07] about certain jobs you got to do but
[1:37:09] this will not Usher you forward into a
[1:37:12] position of
[1:37:13] adoption unless you mix that voice with
[1:37:17] something that's got power in
[1:37:21] it woo I like to feel what I feel what
[1:37:24] I'm feeling what I'm
[1:37:25] feeling the word has the ability to take
[1:37:29] your very positive thought and drive it
[1:37:32] all the way down to hit the
[1:37:35] mark glory to God that High Mark that
[1:37:38] Paul talked about of the high calling in
[1:37:40] Jesus
[1:37:41] Christ imagine what that must be like as
[1:37:44] a human being to just say certain things
[1:37:47] hoping it might all be all right but
[1:37:50] then the minute you take your voice and
[1:37:52] mix it with the word
[1:37:55] now it's an entirely different thing
[1:37:57] altogether no wonder the devil hates the
[1:38:00] man or the woman or the family or the
[1:38:02] church or the preacher or the whoever
[1:38:04] that knows how to take that word upon
[1:38:06] their lips and speak it just like God
[1:38:10] does such a person that gets that right
[1:38:13] they're
[1:38:17] undefeatable you couldn't conquer such a
[1:38:19] man or woman if you tried Glory
[1:38:23] cuz to beat them you'd have to beat the
[1:38:25] word and brother you can't beat the word
[1:38:28] woo thank you Lord notice he said but
[1:38:31] the word brought into the channel of
[1:38:33] your thought so when the spirit and the
[1:38:36] bride say say voice say come notice it's
[1:38:42] not just the bride speaking but the
[1:38:44] spirit and the bride are both
[1:38:47] speaking so somewhere again the
[1:38:50] relationship between bridegroom and
[1:38:52] bride the there must have been a
[1:38:54] blending together
[1:38:56] somewhere somewhere there must have been
[1:38:58] a Unity Hallelujah their voice has
[1:39:01] become his voice his voice has become
[1:39:06] theirs how could they speak come if
[1:39:10] there was nothing in their voice of
[1:39:12] authority on
[1:39:14] now you think back to the days of the
[1:39:16] Ark when God was going to call every two
[1:39:18] creature into the ark every two of its
[1:39:21] kind male and a female
[1:39:24] the spirit of the
[1:39:25] Lord didn't even have to come out there
[1:39:28] with an angel a big bullhorn and speak
[1:39:30] it
[1:39:31] out but they had a sensitivity to know
[1:39:34] when their creator was calling them to
[1:39:37] just follow along until they got into
[1:39:39] the
[1:39:40] ark they say that's about like a dove is
[1:39:42] a dove no matter where you might release
[1:39:44] it like a an old pigeon or something
[1:39:46] like that you take it and release it it
[1:39:47] could go all Halfway Around the World it
[1:39:49] will always have a sense of home and
[1:39:50] know where home's at
[1:39:53] all creation recognizes the voice of its
[1:39:58] creator which is the reason why we still
[1:40:00] listen at this fell that died in 1965
[1:40:03] and listened to the messages preached on
[1:40:05] those
[1:40:06] recordings cuz we're not really
[1:40:08] listening for William brandham we can
[1:40:10] identify with the voice of our creator
[1:40:12] speaking through the lips of that
[1:40:14] Prophet that's why we still come to
[1:40:16] church and hear preachers preach even
[1:40:18] though it might be some little country
[1:40:20] Corn bed preacher doesn't matter we're
[1:40:23] not Liv listen for the hit H and pack
[1:40:25] and fetch and y'all and tote we're
[1:40:27] listening for the voice of God
[1:40:33] speaking now let's turn to Revelation
[1:40:35] chapter 10 I want to look at verse 7 now
[1:40:39] this is familiar to us but I want you to
[1:40:41] read along with me I'm going to try to
[1:40:42] break some things down make this pler
[1:40:44] and that the Lord will help me I'm going
[1:40:46] to try if I can to get into this about
[1:40:48] the confession and things before we
[1:40:51] quit thank you Lord Jesus
[1:40:53] you love the Lord yeah you hanging in
[1:40:56] there with me that's good that's good
[1:41:00] good good all right we're just going to
[1:41:02] kind of take just a couple of these
[1:41:03] verses and I want to start breaking this
[1:41:04] down a little bit but in the days of the
[1:41:08] what the voice of the seventh angel now
[1:41:12] this this word
[1:41:13] voice I I'll spell it for you and then
[1:41:16] I'll tell you how it
[1:41:17] sounds the word in the Greek for voice
[1:41:19] is p h o NE e
[1:41:23] all that can spell you should say
[1:41:27] Amen this is what that word means in the
[1:41:30] original phone but the way you say it is
[1:41:35] phony so you see the thing about the
[1:41:37] message is it's either going to produce
[1:41:39] a Divine voice to you or it's going to
[1:41:42] create a
[1:41:44] phony because there's always two classes
[1:41:47] of people in any Revival you've got
[1:41:50] those that hear from God and then you've
[1:41:52] got a bunch of phonies it followed
[1:41:53] around
[1:41:56] too now notice the voice or the phone
[1:41:59] when you're talking on a phone this
[1:42:01] ain't no spiritual conference
[1:42:02] call you got a number he's got a number
[1:42:05] and you are connected directly to the
[1:42:08] voice this is the whole reason the
[1:42:10] Rapture is going to be a complete and
[1:42:11] total secret to the entire world the
[1:42:13] resurrection will be on the Rapture will
[1:42:15] be on it'll be a complete secret to
[1:42:17] everybody else why only those that have
[1:42:20] had the original phone call only those
[1:42:22] that have been connected to the voice
[1:42:24] are the ones that's going to know when
[1:42:26] it comes time to get out of
[1:42:29] here
[1:42:31] hallelujah and you see the thing about
[1:42:33] the messages not everybody gets the same
[1:42:36] phone
[1:42:37] call they'll be thousands of thousands
[1:42:40] of people that will never get that call
[1:42:42] because the message is only for the
[1:42:47] bright that's why friends whenever we go
[1:42:49] to preaching salvation and we preach
[1:42:52] salvation by William brandom we make an
[1:42:54] antichrist out of our Prophet salvation
[1:42:56] comes by Jesus Christ a person can be
[1:43:00] saved a person can be Sanctified a
[1:43:03] person can be ever so close to the Holy
[1:43:06] Ghost and never go far enough to
[1:43:08] actually receive the Holy
[1:43:11] Ghost and they don't even have to hear
[1:43:13] about the message or brother brandom to
[1:43:15] be
[1:43:17] saved but if they want to make the
[1:43:19] Rapture or go as a part of the Bride of
[1:43:22] this day it takes the message to put you
[1:43:24] in that category cuz that's what that
[1:43:27] voice was sent for was to prepare a
[1:43:29] bride not the whole world the
[1:43:32] bride you understand this is the reason
[1:43:34] why for many years we've thrown
[1:43:36] everybody in hell that can't see the
[1:43:38] message many can't they're not called to
[1:43:42] it but through the years people drive
[1:43:45] beat their families in the head and
[1:43:47] drive them down all you got to see the
[1:43:49] message only if they get a phone call
[1:43:54] if they don't I keep my token over them
[1:43:56] and I keep
[1:43:57] praying and if I can just get them
[1:44:00] saved if I can just see and meet Jesus
[1:44:03] and get saved that's good enough for me
[1:44:05] it's up to him after that what does he
[1:44:06] want to do with them it's up to the Lord
[1:44:09] after that are you with me say
[1:44:13] Amen but the message itself is to the
[1:44:16] special prophetic class they're the ones
[1:44:19] that need to hear it because they're the
[1:44:20] ones that need to know how to get ready
[1:44:24] yeah it's the sound of uttered words
[1:44:27] meaning this is a living
[1:44:29] voice so just because brother bram's
[1:44:31] voice went quiet on us doesn't mean that
[1:44:33] the living voice
[1:44:35] has that same living voice is still
[1:44:39] speaking and not just when you push play
[1:44:42] Nei not just when you P push the little
[1:44:45] button on your live
[1:44:46] stream but that should be something you
[1:44:48] hear in your prayer closet when you're
[1:44:50] sitting on your job or you're driving a
[1:44:52] for cliff or whatever it is when you're
[1:44:53] baking pies or cookies say whatever it
[1:44:55] is you're doing you ought to be able to
[1:44:56] hear me in contact with that
[1:44:59] voice it ought to be something that is
[1:45:01] so intimate to you because Jesus said my
[1:45:04] sheep know my voice and a stranger they
[1:45:06] will not
[1:45:09] follow and if I'm in direct contact with
[1:45:12] that voice then I should be able to move
[1:45:14] on to the next part which is to become
[1:45:17] the very voice that I'm listening
[1:45:19] to now watch this the mystery of course
[1:45:22] the hidden purpose but notice he shall
[1:45:24] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:45:26] be finished as he hath declared this
[1:45:29] word declared means to bring joyful
[1:45:32] Tidings of God's
[1:45:35] kindness you see the message was never
[1:45:39] intended brother Tom to be a beating
[1:45:42] stick to drive people into hell brother
[1:45:44] BR we were never intended as preachers
[1:45:46] to take this message and blast people
[1:45:48] into Oblivion that wasn't the reason the
[1:45:50] message came now many have done that
[1:45:52] many have lived that way we preached
[1:45:54] that way many years ago ourself I'm sure
[1:45:57] some of yall might think I'm still there
[1:45:59] but the message itself is a joyful sound
[1:46:02] to you it is a sound of Liberation a
[1:46:05] sound of Freedom a sound that you can be
[1:46:08] saved delivered that God can turn your
[1:46:11] life Al and revolutionize your walk with
[1:46:15] him the message was never intended to be
[1:46:19] dark sounds and dark words and heavy
[1:46:21] Prophecies of Doom
[1:46:24] gloom and if it's been done that way
[1:46:26] it's because people have made it that
[1:46:27] way but this message should be a
[1:46:30] sounding board of freedom for every
[1:46:33] person that wants to hear
[1:46:36] it thank you
[1:46:38] Lord now watch this now now let's look
[1:46:41] at verse eight and the voice which I
[1:46:44] heard from Heaven spake again and said
[1:46:46] go and take the little book which is
[1:46:50] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:46:51] stand upon the sea upon the Earth and I
[1:46:54] went to the angel and S notice he's
[1:46:57] speaking
[1:46:58] now look what boldness comes out of this
[1:47:02] boy give
[1:47:04] me the little
[1:47:06] book now you understand who he's talking
[1:47:08] to right this is not William brandham
[1:47:11] this is the mighty Angel this is Christ
[1:47:15] the messenger of the Covenant with the
[1:47:16] rainbow above his head Jesus
[1:47:20] himself he takes this book
[1:47:25] and it comes down to open it up to give
[1:47:27] us the the the ability to tap into the
[1:47:30] potential in that book this is the whole
[1:47:34] reason why the Bible said in the last
[1:47:35] days we would have the manifestation of
[1:47:37] the sons of God why because the message
[1:47:40] itself would release to the elect of God
[1:47:43] the ability to come back to that kind of
[1:47:47] position
[1:47:49] while Martin Luther was here
[1:47:53] the best a person could do was get
[1:47:55] justified by faith and they didn't even
[1:47:58] understand what that looked like that
[1:47:59] just meant being forgiven of your past
[1:48:01] sins but real justification was solved
[1:48:04] up here in the last day when he told us
[1:48:07] that justify really means as Paul had
[1:48:09] said it before and as it's found in the
[1:48:11] Bible that we are justified by faith it
[1:48:14] means that we were forgiven as though it
[1:48:16] never happened in the first
[1:48:19] place woo Glory brother you talk about
[1:48:23] the Forgiveness of sins
[1:48:26] Hallelujah so the best a person could do
[1:48:29] in Pentecost the best a person could do
[1:48:31] during the Wesleyan age and while
[1:48:33] brother Brandon was here the best we
[1:48:35] could do was just follow along with the
[1:48:38] restoring of the word until it came time
[1:48:41] for that part of the mystery to come
[1:48:46] open and here stands
[1:48:48] John give
[1:48:50] me the little book it's it's almost like
[1:48:53] he read that scripture that Paul said
[1:48:55] come boldly it's almost like he was
[1:48:57] familiar with that understanding of come
[1:49:01] boldly wasn't he been afraid to say to
[1:49:04] Christ give it to me I think brother if
[1:49:07] I've been standing before the Lord I'd
[1:49:08] have been a little scared or squeamish
[1:49:10] to say too
[1:49:11] much y'all looking at me a little funny
[1:49:13] but you know if you were standing in the
[1:49:15] presence of that light like Danny
[1:49:16] Greenfield and these other ones we heard
[1:49:17] stories about if you were standing there
[1:49:19] in the real authentic sacred presence of
[1:49:22] God
[1:49:23] you wouldn't be jumping and running and
[1:49:24] hollering and acting like some kind of a
[1:49:25] smart Elling you'd be scared to
[1:49:29] breathe and anybody that's ever been in
[1:49:31] the real genuine authentic presence of
[1:49:32] the Lord like that you know what it's
[1:49:34] like it's a terrifying
[1:49:36] thing it's not Joys and shouts that's
[1:49:39] when the anointing is
[1:49:40] on but when you start entering into the
[1:49:42] real sacredness of the lord it's such a
[1:49:44] fearful
[1:49:46] thing and yet Paul said come boldly
[1:49:50] anyways Glory
[1:49:53] how to come boldly to him and speak to
[1:49:55] him much less demand him give me my Holy
[1:49:59] Ghost give to me my healing give to me
[1:50:04] the portion of my inheritance that
[1:50:06] belongs to
[1:50:11] me start looking at like this you
[1:50:13] realize how kind of backward type
[1:50:15] Christians we've been through the years
[1:50:16] huh how LAX and almost squeamish we've
[1:50:19] been about things I guarantee if we
[1:50:21] really saw in the right way we would
[1:50:23] understand that Christ wants us to not
[1:50:25] only be bold but
[1:50:29] authorative not demanding now that's
[1:50:32] different demanding comes from the realm
[1:50:34] of selfishness I want I want I want
[1:50:37] therefore you better give it to me
[1:50:38] that's that attitude of entitlement well
[1:50:41] I'm the bride Hallelujah so you give it
[1:50:42] to me because I'm the bride but it's an
[1:50:44] air of humility knowing I'm not saying
[1:50:46] this to you Lord I'm not asking of this
[1:50:48] Lord because I feel like that I deserve
[1:50:50] it or I'm worthy of it but I'm I'm doing
[1:50:53] it because you said it's
[1:50:56] mine glory to God hallelujah
[1:51:00] hallelujah and because you said it's
[1:51:03] mine give me the little
[1:51:06] book now you know doctorally this book
[1:51:09] you can go a thousand ways with it but
[1:51:10] in its Simplicity this book represents
[1:51:13] the very tital deed to the blessings of
[1:51:16] God which you receive by the way when
[1:51:18] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:20] Ghost access
[1:51:24] access to the blessings of
[1:51:29] God you have not because you ask
[1:51:33] not all you got to do is
[1:51:36] speak oh praise the Lord now watch he
[1:51:40] takes this book he eats it it's sweet in
[1:51:42] his mouth bitter in his belly because it
[1:51:45] changes the appetite you see once you
[1:51:48] receive the Holy Ghost the things you
[1:51:49] used to Crave after you don't anymore
[1:51:54] there's a fell he just went on to be
[1:51:55] with the Lord about six seven months ago
[1:51:57] but I remember his testimony down in
[1:51:59] Dayton Ohio he was telling about how
[1:52:01] they used to drink all the time and and
[1:52:02] run to bars and everything the Lord
[1:52:04] saved him in a old fashioned meeting and
[1:52:05] he received the Holy Ghost and he he he
[1:52:08] said I got in my car and he said I would
[1:52:10] go drive to them same bars and go sit in
[1:52:12] a parking lot way off to the side and
[1:52:14] pray against them do you know 11 of them
[1:52:17] 11 of them in Dayton Ohio 11 of them
[1:52:20] burnt to the ground
[1:52:23] because he asked God to destroy them
[1:52:25] hell Dives no he wasn't an arsonist and
[1:52:28] no they're not looking for
[1:52:29] him but all of them some different
[1:52:32] mechanical failure some electrical
[1:52:34] failure some kind of fell was playing
[1:52:36] around with some kind of a cigarette
[1:52:37] lighter and it fell in a bunch of
[1:52:38] alcohol every one of them burnt to
[1:52:42] ashes because he go in there and he sit
[1:52:45] in that parking lot for a few minutes
[1:52:46] and start praying God you know what this
[1:52:48] place done to me you know what it done
[1:52:49] to my family how many more is it is it
[1:52:51] tormented how many more devils are
[1:52:53] getting their way with people tonight
[1:52:56] Lord destroy this
[1:52:59] place sounds presumptuous in a way but
[1:53:02] when you know your voice you speak
[1:53:05] it cuz Watch What Happens Next and he
[1:53:08] said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:53:13] again in other words you've got to have
[1:53:16] a
[1:53:17] voice once you know your
[1:53:20] potential speak
[1:53:24] amen oh thank you Lord in the breach
[1:53:26] brother B said like this it's Redemption
[1:53:28] means all legal possession that was lost
[1:53:31] by Adam and Eve it belongs to you
[1:53:34] again so what of it Brethren the
[1:53:37] possession of that deed not watch now in
[1:53:40] Proverbs 18: 21 the Bible said death and
[1:53:43] life are in the power of the
[1:53:46] tongue that's not referring to just
[1:53:48] simply whether the muscle is strong or
[1:53:51] not that's not the power of of the
[1:53:53] tongue that might be the strength of it
[1:53:55] but that's not the power of it the power
[1:53:58] of the tongue is what's hiding in here
[1:54:02] because what's in here will be what's
[1:54:04] entertained up here and what's
[1:54:06] entertained up here will be what's
[1:54:08] spoken out here because Jesus said out
[1:54:11] of the heart
[1:54:17] proceedes watch this again in Matthew
[1:54:19] 12:36 but I say every idal word that men
[1:54:24] shall speak they'll give account thereof
[1:54:26] in the day of
[1:54:27] judgment watch now for by thy words Thou
[1:54:31] shalt be
[1:54:32] justified and by thy words Thou shalt be
[1:54:36] condemned so if you want to be blessed
[1:54:39] what you say will bless you if you
[1:54:42] expect to be condemned at some point in
[1:54:44] your life more than likely go back and
[1:54:45] look at what you
[1:54:47] said and it will follow you through to
[1:54:49] condemnation many people don't realize
[1:54:51] they're their Own Worst Enemy because of
[1:54:53] how they talk all the time yeah what
[1:54:56] they meditate on what they think on do
[1:54:58] you realize that when you sit around all
[1:54:59] the time going oh I'm sick I'm sick oh
[1:55:02] boy I'm sick I'm in a mess boy my life
[1:55:04] is is is is leaving me Bo I'm sicker
[1:55:07] than I've ever been boy I I'm you
[1:55:09] realize what the devil's trying to get
[1:55:11] you to do meditate on it and give your
[1:55:13] tongue negative
[1:55:18] power so you know what we ought to do
[1:55:21] recogniz the devil in every one of his
[1:55:25] tricks and every time he comes by and
[1:55:27] tells you you're getting worse say shut
[1:55:29] your mouth I'm getting better every
[1:55:31] single day that I
[1:55:36] live praise the Lord feel bad what do
[1:55:39] you mean feel bad I don't go on feelings
[1:55:42] I go on
[1:55:44] faith Satan knows if he can just get you
[1:55:47] to entertain it long enough right here
[1:55:49] in the heart and the mind the thoughts
[1:55:51] that's the Dynamo where power is
[1:55:55] created how much stronger would our
[1:55:58] experiences be before God if we would
[1:56:00] take the word into our mouth instead of
[1:56:02] speaking every old stupid thing that
[1:56:03] goes through our
[1:56:08] brain now watch this in diseases and
[1:56:10] afflictions brother said like this God
[1:56:12] can't do nothing till you first confess
[1:56:15] that he is I love this right here you
[1:56:19] see there's a system a pattern so to
[1:56:21] speak yeah that in order for us to get
[1:56:24] to the spot to where we can receive
[1:56:26] blessings and healings we we got to go
[1:56:28] start at the very beginning of it the
[1:56:31] first thing is to recognize he is he is
[1:56:34] what doesn't matter he
[1:56:37] is cuz when you're talking about all the
[1:56:40] English language French whatever other
[1:56:43] kind of language we'll fail to describe
[1:56:45] what Al really means when it comes to
[1:56:48] God we know what we know but he's Way
[1:56:51] Beyond even what we we
[1:56:57] know
[1:56:59] here the Bible said you must first
[1:57:02] accept that he is Paul telling us you've
[1:57:06] got to acknowledge Him First why where
[1:57:09] do you think you get power to speak if
[1:57:12] you don't recognize where the power
[1:57:15] began if I wanted to to to speak healing
[1:57:18] to my body or to someone else how could
[1:57:22] I ever muster up enough intellectual
[1:57:25] power to get that person there I
[1:57:28] couldn't do it because they've been
[1:57:29] trying for years and years and years and
[1:57:31] they comat back and forth and one study
[1:57:33] and one peer review this and one
[1:57:35] argument and one experiment one test
[1:57:37] they can't figure out whether you're
[1:57:38] supposed to drink coffee or
[1:57:40] not and every new study tells you do it
[1:57:43] will say no don't you dare do it and
[1:57:46] somebody else will come along and say if
[1:57:47] you do it your that's Death to Your Body
[1:57:50] the next one coming along saying if you
[1:57:52] don't do it it'll kill
[1:57:57] you praise the Lord how could I take the
[1:58:01] power of their mind and apply healing to
[1:58:04] me or you I can't do it but if I take a
[1:58:07] step back and I acknowledge there's one
[1:58:10] there's one by his stripes I am already
[1:58:15] healed that I didn't have to do it for
[1:58:18] me anyways it's not up to me to heal my
[1:58:21] body it's it's not up to you to heal
[1:58:23] your body I just simply acknowledge he
[1:58:29] is he is the Healer he is the savior he
[1:58:34] is the deliverer he is all and
[1:58:40] all and if I start there I'm on a pretty
[1:58:43] good road for whatever comes after
[1:58:46] that cuz what could the devil do to
[1:58:48] combat
[1:58:49] that what could Satan really say to
[1:58:52] fight that if he comes to me and say oh
[1:58:55] see you ain't got enough faith it
[1:58:56] doesn't matter if I have faith he
[1:58:59] is what you you messed up and got scared
[1:59:01] it doesn't matter if I'm scared he still
[1:59:03] is that's my part that's a me problem
[1:59:06] that's not a him problem he's the one
[1:59:08] that already declared by my strip you
[1:59:11] are already
[1:59:12] healed and all I got to do no matter how
[1:59:15] weak I might get no matter how much
[1:59:16] doubt may come through me no matter how
[1:59:18] scared I might get or how many nightless
[1:59:21] nights I sleep all I got to do is come
[1:59:24] right back to Center and start right
[1:59:26] back at the first and say you know what
[1:59:28] Lord in spite of everything all my
[1:59:30] little Humanities and weaknesses that
[1:59:32] doesn't matter I'm sorry you forgive me
[1:59:34] for that here we are Lord you
[1:59:39] are do you remember what he told Moses
[1:59:42] when he's getting ready to deliver those
[1:59:43] children out of Egypt go down and tell
[1:59:45] them I am that I am you know if that was
[1:59:48] good enough advice for a little old 80y
[1:59:51] bald-headed Prophet to go down with a
[1:59:53] crooked stick in his hand and take over
[1:59:54] the most powerful nation in the world
[1:59:56] and lead two million people three or 4
[1:59:58] days journey across the Wilderness to a
[2:00:00] land FL and full of milk and honey on
[2:00:02] the message I am that I am and brother
[2:00:04] in this day and age it ought to be
[2:00:06] supercharged and Super Sonic beyond
[2:00:11] that not I was that I was or I will be
[2:00:14] that I will be but I am that I
[2:00:17] am not a god Bound by
[2:00:20] time cuz the worst thing into a person's
[2:00:22] faith is time and
[2:00:25] sight and those two things always draw
[2:00:28] you back into that war of do I believe
[2:00:31] it do I believe it I know you have to
[2:00:32] have faith but listen your own human
[2:00:34] faith is just not good
[2:00:36] enough because you can believe with
[2:00:38] everything that you got in you and yet
[2:00:39] your human faith will fail
[2:00:43] you but if I keep coming back to one
[2:00:46] thing and I start saying lord it's
[2:00:50] really not my faith that I need
[2:00:52] what I need is your faith I need you
[2:00:56] believing this through me then no matter
[2:00:58] how many times I might waver or this or
[2:01:00] that or that doesn't matter I'm
[2:01:01] confident that what he says is going to
[2:01:03] be that
[2:01:04] way
[2:01:06] amen he says then you confess it believe
[2:01:08] it act on it and stay with
[2:01:11] it and then God will bring you out he
[2:01:14] says do you believe
[2:01:15] that notice again Minister explained he
[2:01:18] said now he's the high priest of your
[2:01:20] con can I get a few more minut see your
[2:01:22] time all right thank you he's the high
[2:01:24] priest of your confession you get what I
[2:01:25] mean you confess what you are and that's
[2:01:29] what you
[2:01:31] are that sounds pretty simple don't it
[2:01:34] why is that the hardest thing to do
[2:01:36] then if it's that easy why is it the
[2:01:39] hardest thing to do because your body
[2:01:41] and your flesh your human spirit is not
[2:01:44] designed after the fall is made it was
[2:01:46] designed by God to do the right things
[2:01:48] but after the fall it's
[2:01:50] tainted and no matter how much of the
[2:01:52] word you fill this with that tree of
[2:01:54] knowledge of Good and Evil will still
[2:01:56] find evil somewhere to wrap around
[2:02:01] in no matter how much you might say you
[2:02:04] believe it or else your spirit does not
[2:02:06] have the ability to or else it's made up
[2:02:10] of a mixed tree and no matter how good
[2:02:12] it may behave at certain times it's
[2:02:14] going to fail you that's going to waver
[2:02:16] back to the other side and it's going to
[2:02:18] do the exact
[2:02:19] opposite so you got to make it do the
[2:02:22] right
[2:02:23] thing and how do I do that I confess it
[2:02:27] to the place I want
[2:02:29] it when it don't want to I make it
[2:02:36] anyways some of y'all might think I was
[2:02:38] crazy now you know I am don't
[2:02:40] you I'm not too crazy now I know where
[2:02:42] I'm standing on some of this brother
[2:02:44] says a man will never live any higher
[2:02:46] than what he believes he's living you
[2:02:49] take a man talking about drinking all
[2:02:50] the time he talks about thinks about it
[2:02:52] he drops right down into that
[2:02:55] category why he talks himself into being
[2:02:59] what he says he
[2:03:00] is his body just obeys the confession he
[2:03:03] speaks it the body says yep that's what
[2:03:05] I am because the body is made and
[2:03:08] designed to follow your voice what you
[2:03:11] think what you
[2:03:13] say all of those two little uh those two
[2:03:16] simple elements together Encompass a lot
[2:03:19] of thinking in the middle of the night
[2:03:21] and a lot of negativity from the radio
[2:03:23] and on and on and
[2:03:24] on no wonder brother B said that when we
[2:03:27] get ready for church to come in sit down
[2:03:29] and take some time 30 minutes he said
[2:03:31] and read our Bible and pray before
[2:03:32] church wonder
[2:03:34] why wonder why cuz we've been bombarded
[2:03:37] the entire day with
[2:03:39] foolishness and then we come into church
[2:03:42] the song leader does his best to kind of
[2:03:44] get us into a rhythm of worship and
[2:03:46] things like that and sometimes you win
[2:03:48] sometimes you
[2:03:49] lose I've led singing too a lot through
[2:03:52] my life and I know how it is with some
[2:03:53] people sometimes they come ready to sing
[2:03:56] Sometimes they come ready to
[2:03:58] stare I've had more staring contests
[2:04:00] with congregations in this world in my
[2:04:02] lifetime than what I ever care to
[2:04:07] recall and it should not be that way but
[2:04:09] we live under the effects of this leoan
[2:04:13] time where that's constantly around us
[2:04:16] constantly bombarding us constantly
[2:04:18] hammering at us which is why we should
[2:04:20] spend time praying and getting away from
[2:04:22] all of
[2:04:23] that spend time with our Bible and with
[2:04:26] the Lord right to ask God to quieten all
[2:04:29] them voices in us until we can hear hear
[2:04:32] from him and only
[2:04:34] him
[2:04:36] amen cuz what I believe I am is the way
[2:04:40] I will train my body to act I'll train
[2:04:43] my voice to speak that way you ever say
[2:04:47] something and wonder what I say that for
[2:04:49] I always say that I say that constantly
[2:04:51] what do I say them things like that for
[2:04:53] where do they come from you just don't
[2:04:55] realize those are reactions out of you
[2:04:57] that you've been training into you for
[2:05:00] years you ever wonder how some kids
[2:05:02] start speaking
[2:05:03] English when you first hear that little
[2:05:05] baby he's going g g go go next thing you
[2:05:07] know he won't shut up spend our whole
[2:05:09] first couple years trying to tell him to
[2:05:10] walk and speak and then spend the next
[2:05:12] 16 tell them sit down and shut
[2:05:16] up that's right
[2:05:19] huh how did they learn learn how to
[2:05:22] speak English in big words the
[2:05:25] environment around them just kept
[2:05:26] hammering it into them and that human
[2:05:29] Spirit was designed not to just hear
[2:05:30] Mommy and Daddy's voice but all the
[2:05:32] voices around
[2:05:35] them the next thing you know whatever
[2:05:37] went in is the thing that starts coming
[2:05:39] out and you're riding down the road and
[2:05:40] they say something clever and you can't
[2:05:42] get it on the phone fast enough and
[2:05:43] you're yelling at one another quick
[2:05:44] record it get it on Facebook for the L
[2:05:46] of God put it on Instagram
[2:05:49] quack I got 322 people need need to see
[2:05:51] this right now right
[2:05:55] now where did it come from they lived in
[2:05:59] an environment where things were trained
[2:06:00] into them to produce a result out like
[2:06:04] oh God if it's that way just learning
[2:06:06] the language how much more should it be
[2:06:08] for Christians that we live in the
[2:06:10] environment of Christ we live in an
[2:06:12] atmosphere of the Lord what do you think
[2:06:14] is going to come out of us when we live
[2:06:15] in such an
[2:06:17] atmosphere spiritual Supernatural things
[2:06:20] friends if brother was against
[2:06:22] television and movies and things this is
[2:06:24] why he was against it not because he was
[2:06:26] going to throw you in hell if you went
[2:06:27] and saw some little cartoon at Christmas
[2:06:29] time or something like that come on quit
[2:06:32] being such a ridiculous
[2:06:33] legalist if such things would send
[2:06:35] people to hell in this message there'd
[2:06:37] be a thousand I'm in hell right
[2:06:39] now that wasn't what brother Brown was
[2:06:41] trying to get at Hollywood's power has
[2:06:45] nothing to do with some little
[2:06:46] entertaining show it's the atmosphere it
[2:06:49] creates around the human mind
[2:06:53] when you take some of these kids and
[2:06:55] some of these people that live in these
[2:06:56] video game worlds where they're killing
[2:06:57] all the time look look what kind of
[2:06:59] aggression comes out of that child and
[2:07:01] it doesn't even realize it's being
[2:07:03] aggressive why it's the world it lives
[2:07:06] in all the
[2:07:09] time praise the
[2:07:12] Lord Brother Carol used to tell this
[2:07:14] joke many years ago he said how do you
[2:07:15] know that the deacons the the preachers
[2:07:17] kids are so means because they was
[2:07:18] always playing with the Deacon's kids
[2:07:22] something like that it's the atmosphere
[2:07:24] this is why you're known by your company
[2:07:27] huh that's one reason why young people
[2:07:30] Mom Dad may not let want you to hang
[2:07:31] around with certain people they know
[2:07:33] what kind of influence it can have on
[2:07:35] you you may not recognize the influence
[2:07:38] but it's there just the
[2:07:40] same and before you know it your
[2:07:43] behavior will alter things will change
[2:07:44] in the way you behave and how you speak
[2:07:46] and you'll hear your mom and dad say
[2:07:48] what's the matter with you why are you
[2:07:49] talking to me that way and you're
[2:07:51] confused as as they are confused but
[2:07:53] that's how smart the devil is he knows
[2:07:56] how to put things in us and we're not
[2:07:58] even aware of it oh Lord have mercy
[2:08:01] somebody help
[2:08:02] me if it's that way with the devil how
[2:08:05] much more if we kept that word David
[2:08:07] said kept it taped amen tied to his
[2:08:10] fingers kept it before his eyes day and
[2:08:13] night if the word was an influence
[2:08:16] around us all the time Godly company and
[2:08:18] Christian fellowship and those things
[2:08:20] were around us all the time you know
[2:08:22] what it do it produce that Christlike
[2:08:24] Behavior out of
[2:08:27] usen Praise the
[2:08:30] Lord now again and as it was with Moses
[2:08:32] he said now let's him him that's weak
[2:08:34] say I am strong he said just say that in
[2:08:36] your heart I'm strong now I've accepted
[2:08:39] Jesus as my healer never have a negative
[2:08:42] testimony
[2:08:44] anymore for he is setting there the high
[2:08:46] priest to make good before the father on
[2:08:49] the confession that he has done it
[2:08:53] Divine Healing can't be any pler than
[2:08:55] that he says and it's to the weakest
[2:08:58] Christian remember God's word will
[2:08:59] defeat Satan anywhere any place any time
[2:09:03] under any
[2:09:06] condition I can't whip it that way but
[2:09:09] the word can whip it that
[2:09:10] way because the word has power in now
[2:09:13] watch this the manifestation of the
[2:09:14] spirit brother said remember it isn't
[2:09:16] how much you
[2:09:17] cry it isn't how much you repent or how
[2:09:21] low you cry to God and it isn't how
[2:09:23] sincere you can be
[2:09:27] huh so in other words coming to church
[2:09:30] and just becoming emotional is good it's
[2:09:33] a part of it but that alone doesn't get
[2:09:37] you
[2:09:39] there you see I wonder sometimes if
[2:09:42] Church hasn't become a thing where it's
[2:09:44] almost like one big cheerleading session
[2:09:46] where we get everybody like in the
[2:09:47] football game get them just screaming
[2:09:49] and hollering and running
[2:09:51] but when all that emotion passes what's
[2:09:55] anchored because you know what troubles
[2:09:57] me you go to these camps and these
[2:09:59] special meetings and you go to and I
[2:10:01] preach in conventions with these
[2:10:02] brothers and I see things happening and
[2:10:04] people running into the Altar and
[2:10:05] screaming and crying I think thank the
[2:10:06] Lord for
[2:10:08] that but to go back and three months
[2:10:10] later you got the same group of people
[2:10:12] doing the same exact things that they'
[2:10:13] done three months before that and it
[2:10:15] goes on year after
[2:10:17] year at what point do we wake up and say
[2:10:20] maybe we're not going going far
[2:10:23] enough yes I want to see you worship yes
[2:10:26] I love to see the people of God
[2:10:29] emotional but when that's all settled
[2:10:31] down I want you to have faith in your
[2:10:33] heart to know who you are who he is and
[2:10:37] where you
[2:10:39] stand preach to me somebody cuz without
[2:10:43] that how what God does it do us to get
[2:10:45] all worked up and happy if we don't even
[2:10:47] know why we're
[2:10:49] happy we got to be solidly
[2:10:52] grounded we got to be have such a
[2:10:54] foundation underneath us brother said
[2:10:57] it's how much Faith you have when you
[2:10:59] come to him he doesn't save you on the
[2:11:01] merits of your prayer or your
[2:11:04] righteousness he saves you upon the
[2:11:07] merits of faith and brother even more
[2:11:10] than that it's not even my faith that he
[2:11:12] really even saves me on the merits of
[2:11:14] it's the fact that I believe what he
[2:11:16] said and God can see that I believe
[2:11:18] it and thank God I've got justce enough
[2:11:21] ability to kind of let go and let him
[2:11:23] have his way cuz if it wasn't for that I
[2:11:26] wouldn't be here today and neither would
[2:11:29] you cuz if it was left up to me opening
[2:11:32] the door to Jesus I know we try to make
[2:11:35] it sound like when we got saved we just
[2:11:36] grabed the door and threw it up yeah
[2:11:38] come on in Lord do what you want I gave
[2:11:40] him just enough to get a big toe in
[2:11:42] between the door and Me closing
[2:11:44] it you did too cuz no man seeks God at
[2:11:48] any time come on don't you look at me
[2:11:50] that way we all
[2:11:52] run from these things like this but God
[2:11:55] knows how to get us in a place where
[2:11:57] we're just simply willing to say okay
[2:11:59] Lord okay
[2:12:02] okay and that's all he needs is just
[2:12:04] that momentary willingness because if
[2:12:07] you me it with all of your heart you are
[2:12:08] on your road prise Lord thank
[2:12:15] you brother said take a woman that come
[2:12:17] here a man let him be ever so vile
[2:12:21] listen to these words they could scream
[2:12:23] and cry and walk up and down the altar
[2:12:25] saying God forgive me day in and day out
[2:12:27] I've repented done everything I could do
[2:12:29] keep pacing but he said until they
[2:12:32] believe it and confess
[2:12:34] it then he can't go to work on it until
[2:12:36] they do he cannot
[2:12:38] intercede until first you
[2:12:42] confess that he is man says woo I feel
[2:12:46] pretty
[2:12:49] good I love this again he said uh we
[2:12:52] have found him and come and see he said
[2:12:53] we have a high priest working on what
[2:12:55] not your crying not your
[2:12:57] repentance not your
[2:13:00] faith ah so it even goes deeper than
[2:13:03] that he is not the high priest of my
[2:13:07] faith huh he's the author of my faith
[2:13:11] he's the finisher of my faith but he's
[2:13:13] not the high priest of my faith he's the
[2:13:16] high priest of My conf Confession yeah
[2:13:20] so I can have Faith all day long and all
[2:13:22] day all night long but until first I
[2:13:25] open my mouth and start saying okay Lord
[2:13:28] I believe what you said in your word I
[2:13:30] am healed I am saved I am delivered I am
[2:13:34] I I am I am I I'm free from this thing
[2:13:37] or I I am bless whatever it is that you
[2:13:39] put in your mouth he cannot be the high
[2:13:41] priest of it until you speak
[2:13:47] it cuz some people say well I got faith
[2:13:50] that's it's only half the picture cuz
[2:13:53] James put it in perspective when he said
[2:13:54] faith without works is
[2:13:58] dead as Pastor said at the beginning of
[2:14:00] the service we've got to act upon what
[2:14:03] we
[2:14:06] say praise the Lord kind of like John
[2:14:08] Ryan when he went into that barber shop
[2:14:10] he'd been testifying extra extra read
[2:14:12] all about it and all of a sudden one day
[2:14:14] telling the his eyes come wide open and
[2:14:17] it went running down the street that
[2:14:19] that barber cap still on him it was
[2:14:20] flying behind him like Superman I guess
[2:14:22] he felt like Superman after that
[2:14:24] happened right but he just kept saying
[2:14:27] it extra extra read all about it man
[2:14:28] that was blind is healed people thought
[2:14:30] John shut up ain't nothing happened to
[2:14:33] you you knit
[2:14:34] with but Jesus was saying the same thing
[2:14:38] that John was saying and every time John
[2:14:41] would say man was blind is healed Jesus
[2:14:43] say man that was blind extra extra he'd
[2:14:45] tell it throughout Heaven extra extra
[2:14:47] read all about it man that was blind is
[2:14:49] healed amen
[2:14:54] Glory thank you Jesus thank you Lord cuz
[2:14:58] that's what confession is say the same
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:04] thing if God tells me I'm Healed brother
[2:15:09] I don't care what critic raises up
[2:15:10] against it or what I even think about it
[2:15:12] myself if I'm Healed I'm Healed if I'm
[2:15:15] saved I'm
[2:15:18] saved praise the Lord
[2:15:21] listen to this
[2:15:23] again I hear people say many times oh it
[2:15:25] hit me in the face like a mighty rushing
[2:15:27] wind that might be all right but that
[2:15:31] wasn't why you were
[2:15:33] saved you were saved because you
[2:15:35] believed no matter what experience might
[2:15:37] have went with
[2:15:38] it the first thing was you had to
[2:15:42] believe now it's a strange thing many
[2:15:43] people say well I'm weak I don't have
[2:15:45] much faith and things he said that's
[2:15:47] just what the devil wants you to say
[2:15:51] you're just talking his language right
[2:15:54] then never permit a negative thought to
[2:15:58] come to your mind if you can help it
[2:16:00] again message of Grace he said see here
[2:16:02] here at the altar day and night praying
[2:16:04] doesn't do you a bit of good until you
[2:16:06] believe he forgives you and then you
[2:16:07] stand up and speak I talking about Jonah
[2:16:10] who had all the con the the the symptoms
[2:16:12] and things wh watch how he T takes Jonah
[2:16:14] what he says about him he said now look
[2:16:16] at our symptoms look at Jonah he said
[2:16:18] shame on
[2:16:19] us he
[2:16:21] refused to look at
[2:16:25] them you understand this is where the
[2:16:27] man's Faith was anchored that Solomon
[2:16:31] said if a man gets in trouble let him
[2:16:33] look toward that Temple and God said he
[2:16:35] would hear from heaven so what he was
[2:16:37] looking at was nothing but a bunch of of
[2:16:40] whales belly everywhere he looked
[2:16:42] seaweed and darkness and God knows what
[2:16:44] El a man was looking at much less
[2:16:46] swimming in vomiting everything else in
[2:16:48] the world good Lord yeah
[2:16:52] and yet there was something about
[2:16:56] him that he remembered the word of the
[2:17:00] Lord I don't care what you're in right
[2:17:03] now or what kind of circumstances you
[2:17:06] might be swimming around in right now if
[2:17:09] you'll just look back to the promise of
[2:17:11] God that said I am your
[2:17:13] deliver he'll deliver you the same as he
[2:17:16] did
[2:17:18] Jonah cuz he is the same yes yesterday
[2:17:21] today and
[2:17:23] forever prise the Lord glory to
[2:17:28] God but it's not a declaration of what I
[2:17:31] can do you see this is where we got to
[2:17:32] be careful we tell people now you
[2:17:34] confess it I'm not confessing I am doing
[2:17:39] [Laughter]
[2:17:42] anything
[2:17:43] amen I am not confessing that I have the
[2:17:47] power to do
[2:17:49] anything I am not not confessing of my
[2:17:52] memory I'm not confessing of my ability
[2:17:54] to quote I'm not confessing of my
[2:17:56] ability to do anything I am confessing
[2:17:59] that he is my
[2:18:04] deliverer he
[2:18:07] is and as I confess
[2:18:10] him he said if you'll acknowledge me
[2:18:13] before my father and the Holy Angels
[2:18:14] I'll acknowledge you if I confess him
[2:18:16] he'll turn right around and confess
[2:18:20] he'll turn right around and confess me
[2:18:23] if I say he is my healer he'll say I am
[2:18:25] your
[2:18:26] healer he is my deliverer I am your
[2:18:32] deliverer one of these days brother I'm
[2:18:34] going to say it he is my resurrection
[2:18:37] and he's going to sweep down somewhere
[2:18:40] between 600 and 9 and say I am your
[2:18:45] resurrection and your
[2:18:49] rapture thank you Lord
[2:18:51] cuz my confession isn't based upon the
[2:18:54] doctor it isn't based upon their tests
[2:18:58] it isn't based upon their expertise and
[2:19:01] though they may be a sincere as God
[2:19:03] himself that's not where my confession
[2:19:09] May I'm not basing it upon an herb or a
[2:19:11] pill or a shot or a
[2:19:15] surgery My Confession is is that God
[2:19:19] heals all right brother said again the
[2:19:21] other day he heals by music he heals by
[2:19:23] love he heals by this he said he heals
[2:19:25] by so many things oh and I thought that
[2:19:28] brother Brad that that so many things I
[2:19:29] thought there's so many more things that
[2:19:31] we don't even know how God brings
[2:19:33] healing but my
[2:19:35] confession is not based on I'm believing
[2:19:39] I'm feeling it doesn't matter what I
[2:19:44] think it's upon the finished
[2:19:47] work of calvary
[2:19:56] you might be saying well I need this
[2:19:57] brother Ben hey I need it
[2:20:00] too sure I need to hear these things as
[2:20:04] much as any other human being does just
[2:20:05] because a man preaches the gospel and
[2:20:07] the anointing and does things like that
[2:20:09] doesn't mean that he's immune from all
[2:20:10] these other things men get discouraged
[2:20:12] men get upset men get sick but what
[2:20:15] would I do stand there and say oh Lord
[2:20:16] You know here I'm a preacher and I've
[2:20:18] been faithful to you and upon those
[2:20:20] merits I ask that you heal me or do
[2:20:22] something what what no good will my
[2:20:23] merits do when all of my righteousness
[2:20:26] is filthy
[2:20:28] rags the only thing I could do is just
[2:20:30] go to him and say Lord upon the basis of
[2:20:32] your sacrifice upon you being the
[2:20:35] perpetuation of Calvary upon your word
[2:20:38] that said if I'll confess it you'll do
[2:20:43] it praise
[2:20:47] God he said they're just lying vanities
[2:20:49] he said well God give us men of women
[2:20:52] men and women of rugged Faith who not
[2:20:54] look at the symptoms or anything else
[2:20:55] the devil hands to you they'll just hand
[2:20:57] it back to him and say I believe in the
[2:21:00] resurrection of Jesus Christ I believe
[2:21:02] in his all sufficient power I believe
[2:21:04] his presence is here to set me free from
[2:21:06] any bondage that Satan puts on me see
[2:21:09] now you're talking with power now you're
[2:21:12] talking with
[2:21:13] authority CU it's not standing there
[2:21:15] saying well Lord I believe the message
[2:21:17] for so long and I you remember the story
[2:21:18] of Danny Greenfield you remember the
[2:21:20] brother tells about this great
[2:21:22] evangelist he gets in the presence of
[2:21:24] God it's a dream and as he gets in the
[2:21:26] presence of the light he said I've done
[2:21:27] so many things evangelized and traveled
[2:21:29] and preached and done great signs and
[2:21:31] wonders he said but in the presence of
[2:21:33] that light brother Joe none of that
[2:21:35] meant
[2:21:36] anything what good the greatest preacher
[2:21:39] that's ever been what goodness could he
[2:21:42] present next to a god of
[2:21:44] Eternity a he's a peon he's a blip on a
[2:21:47] radar not even that compared to a holy
[2:21:50] God like our lord
[2:21:53] Jesus and yet many times whenever we
[2:21:55] fall in these situations we'll you'll
[2:21:57] find yourself saying now Lord I've tried
[2:21:59] to be a good Christian I I've tried to
[2:22:00] live right I I've tried to be faithful
[2:22:02] now Lord you see I'm in this situation
[2:22:04] but I've always tried to be true to you
[2:22:07] that ain't got nothing to do with what's
[2:22:09] going to happen in the next steps of
[2:22:11] your life you're trying to produce
[2:22:13] something based upon your own
[2:22:16] merits none of that
[2:22:19] matters but what
[2:22:21] matters is when you look past all of
[2:22:25] that and say Lord good or bad it doesn't
[2:22:28] matter but I'm looking to
[2:22:31] you you are the finished work of
[2:22:38] Calvary let me read you this and let's
[2:22:39] quit calling Jesus on the scene brother
[2:22:42] B said a sinner might come here at the
[2:22:43] altar as a young man or woman at the age
[2:22:45] of 14 they bring your meals here you cry
[2:22:49] until you were 90 years old and would
[2:22:52] never be
[2:22:53] saved until first you
[2:22:56] accept what he's done for
[2:22:59] you now you you can see why modern-day
[2:23:02] Pentecostal stuff don't work because
[2:23:05] it's approaching it from the wrong realm
[2:23:07] from the wrong from the wrong approach
[2:23:09] of things if if you get up here start
[2:23:11] telling a bunch of sad stories and get
[2:23:13] everybody sad and feeling Gloom and and
[2:23:15] doom and then I tell don't you want to
[2:23:17] be saved where you can go where
[2:23:18] grandmother susel is and don't you want
[2:23:21] to have the Holy Ghost so you don't go
[2:23:22] to hell like Old Uncle
[2:23:25] Winford what good does that do in
[2:23:27] getting you saved when you're moving
[2:23:30] upon the merits of an emotional thing
[2:23:33] rather than upon the gospel that said
[2:23:35] all have sin and come short of the glory
[2:23:37] of God and if you will confess with your
[2:23:40] mouth the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt
[2:23:42] be saved that's my foundation not this
[2:23:45] stuff over
[2:23:47] here now don't be deceived if I think
[2:23:50] that tool is going to get you there I'll
[2:23:52] use that tool to get you there I'll make
[2:23:55] you Squall I'll make you ball I'll make
[2:23:57] you scream I'll make you run I'll make
[2:23:59] you pass out on the floor and then I
[2:24:00] will throw that word 15 times as hard as
[2:24:03] I can right in your lap and say okay
[2:24:05] what about it mix them together now you
[2:24:08] got a good Evangelistic sermon anybody
[2:24:11] ever knew Billy Andrews he could scare
[2:24:12] the liver out of you in a matter of 30
[2:24:14] minutes and then get to the altar call
[2:24:15] and start preaching down from 10 he
[2:24:18] start 10 if you ain't in this altar by
[2:24:20] one you in trouble
[2:24:22] honey and he made you feel
[2:24:24] it cuz about the time he got to number
[2:24:27] five the the Flames of hell were so hot
[2:24:30] you could smell smoke in the
[2:24:32] building it worked if you got a gospel
[2:24:35] message attached to
[2:24:39] it but what good does it do to tell give
[2:24:42] people a bunch of Hope based upon no
[2:24:45] scripture at
[2:24:46] all as a preacher my job is to affect
[2:24:50] you in any way I can to get you back
[2:24:54] into the
[2:24:57] word used to be an old boy he's gone to
[2:25:00] he's gone to Glory now Ernest fure you
[2:25:02] ever new brother fure great guy Berry
[2:25:04] coffee's father-in-law is who it is and
[2:25:08] Ernest used to run those big big tent
[2:25:10] meetings years ago the sawdust on the
[2:25:11] floor and the whole thing thousand
[2:25:12] people 10,000 people didn't matter and I
[2:25:16] asked him one time I said when it comes
[2:25:17] to evangelism how did you behave when
[2:25:18] you was my age he said i' climb I'm up
[2:25:20] on a tent pole and preach if I could get
[2:25:22] them to listen to me he said one time I
[2:25:24] done cartwheels just to get their
[2:25:28] attention sure I'll do whatever it takes
[2:25:32] to try to get you to listen to me but
[2:25:33] when I've got your ear I want to feel
[2:25:36] your ears with
[2:25:39] this you see I don't have any problem
[2:25:41] with a man that has a little theatrics
[2:25:43] what he preaches or maybe a little
[2:25:44] theatrical or he tells stories or that
[2:25:46] that's all right with me as long as when
[2:25:47] he's done doing all that I know where
[2:25:49] he's I'm landing
[2:25:52] as long as I know what the message is
[2:25:53] when it's all over with I'm okay with
[2:25:55] that they can preach to me in a clown
[2:25:57] suit if they got a message to preach
[2:26:00] don't matter to me or overhauls or
[2:26:02] anything else Lord y'all getting quiet
[2:26:04] wo you're getting
[2:26:05] quiet because that's what we should be
[2:26:08] watching for what are they going to tell
[2:26:11] me that's the danger if we get caught up
[2:26:15] in all of the Charisma of
[2:26:17] something you know you can get caught up
[2:26:19] in a song it's a beautiful song used to
[2:26:21] be this song many years ago that would
[2:26:23] come on one of these Hillsong people or
[2:26:25] whoever did and and man I used to sing
[2:26:27] the fire of that thing going up and down
[2:26:29] the road and Worship the Lord and
[2:26:30] everything one day all of a sudden I
[2:26:31] heard it again I thought wait a minute
[2:26:34] it's a stupid trinitarian song this DN
[2:26:36] thing made me so mad I thought I've been
[2:26:39] worshiping for six months to a
[2:26:40] trinitarian
[2:26:45] song because I was listening to the
[2:26:47] music and the music moved me and I
[2:26:49] thought I assumed that it was a Oneness
[2:26:52] song Until I heard second person that
[2:26:55] was all it said everything else was just
[2:26:57] as it was but I heard second person when
[2:26:59] I heard that second person oh it was
[2:27:00] nice and cloaked in there nice and quiet
[2:27:02] nice and hid and sandwiched in the
[2:27:04] middle but I thought you got to be
[2:27:06] kidding me this crazy
[2:27:08] thing it's a trinitarian song Oh but boy
[2:27:12] felt good singing
[2:27:14] it but that's the
[2:27:17] problem if you don't watch for what's
[2:27:20] going on and if you're not paying
[2:27:22] attention emotions and Charisma can
[2:27:25] catch you
[2:27:26] quickly have you ever went to the Lord
[2:27:28] and tried to tell him now Lord I've been
[2:27:30] faithful all these
[2:27:32] years now you probably won't say it out
[2:27:34] loud probably a little scared to say it
[2:27:35] out loud huh but I'll speak it for you
[2:27:39] because there have been many times you
[2:27:40] go to God and you say now Lord I've
[2:27:42] tried to be a good Christian I
[2:27:44] tried is that what Paul said that when
[2:27:48] we approach him boldly be sure to bring
[2:27:50] your laundry list and resume of
[2:27:52] everything you've done right as a matter
[2:27:54] of fact the one thing that I loved about
[2:27:56] Moses when Moses went to God the first
[2:27:58] time you know he gave a good resume of
[2:28:00] all of the wars and the campaigns and
[2:28:02] things he won but then he went out 80
[2:28:04] years in the wilderness and he came
[2:28:07] back God asked him if he wanted the job
[2:28:09] he said listen I can't talk I
[2:28:12] stutter I I can't do anything right I'm
[2:28:14] just a failure God said you got the job
[2:28:21] you understand that's what the Lord's
[2:28:23] looking he's not looking what can we do
[2:28:26] but how much are we willing to let him
[2:28:28] do the
[2:28:34] rest
[2:28:36] sure my simple little old silly stupid
[2:28:39] story about that song it's a good
[2:28:41] example you know of how easy it is to
[2:28:43] get caught up in those things really
[2:28:47] that's the distraction that Satan wants
[2:28:49] to put on you though
[2:28:51] distract you from what really matters
[2:28:54] which is nothing more than just pure
[2:28:56] faith and confessing what he's already
[2:28:59] done and just staying right there now
[2:29:02] what happens if I get weak brother Ben
[2:29:04] repent admit it tell God I'm sorry I got
[2:29:07] weak started doubting got fussy whatever
[2:29:10] it I'm sorry Lord forgive me and just
[2:29:14] zero right back in Lord Jesus if you
[2:29:18] don't move for me if you don't do
[2:29:20] something for me I don't know what else
[2:29:21] I could do for myself you understand
[2:29:24] some years ago and they're just now
[2:29:26] proving it now it's coming out what
[2:29:28] we've always known that they broke that
[2:29:30] Co disease out in that laboratory in
[2:29:32] Wuhan and fouchy and that Bunch covered
[2:29:34] it
[2:29:35] up suspicious that just the very day
[2:29:38] after uh some of these things started
[2:29:40] coming to light the evidences and what
[2:29:42] more isn't it amazing that all of a
[2:29:44] sudden President Biden pardons fouchy
[2:29:47] amazing isn't it after millions of
[2:29:49] people people are in their grave Saints
[2:29:51] and
[2:29:53] everything but brother Brenham told us
[2:29:55] in the last days there would be germ
[2:29:58] warfare and we're seeing evidence of it
[2:30:01] broke right around us all the time you
[2:30:04] think that's the last of it they're
[2:30:06] still in these Laboratories around the
[2:30:07] world doing more and more and more and
[2:30:11] more look at how people got so caught up
[2:30:16] until they were fighting Wars and
[2:30:18] parking lots over a person had a mask on
[2:30:20] and they proved the mass didn't do
[2:30:23] nothing wasn't nearly as effective as
[2:30:25] they let
[2:30:26] on China I teach these kids English in
[2:30:29] China and have for five years now China
[2:30:32] had a major lockdown early last year
[2:30:36] they kept them quarantined over and they
[2:30:37] kept getting sicker and sicker and
[2:30:39] sicker you know what finally one of the
[2:30:40] main leaders done he said open
[2:30:42] everything up within six months there
[2:30:44] was not Co spoke of again people got
[2:30:46] their natural antibodies and they was
[2:30:48] able to fight the disease naturally
[2:30:54] but if you look back at our media during
[2:30:55] the time and you look at all the circus
[2:30:57] that was going on around during this one
[2:30:59] small little
[2:31:01] thing called
[2:31:04] covid-19 people were scared to death I
[2:31:06] heard people in the message calling that
[2:31:09] the mark don't take the shot now that's
[2:31:11] the mark of the
[2:31:13] beast you know what I'm trying to say to
[2:31:15] you especially us Americans we get
[2:31:19] caught up in what what we hear and what
[2:31:21] we
[2:31:23] see and what we should have done
[2:31:25] vaccinated or
[2:31:27] not if somebody wanted to get vaccinated
[2:31:30] you know what they should have done walk
[2:31:32] up and bore their shoulder and said in
[2:31:34] the name of Jesus Christ Mark 16 if I
[2:31:37] drink any deadly thing it will not harm
[2:31:42] me but you know what a lot of people
[2:31:44] done started making it some kind of a of
[2:31:47] an issue and every bit of it got people
[2:31:50] so far away from this right
[2:31:54] here folks were living in fear left and
[2:31:57] right I hope you're listening to me
[2:31:58] church it was only a
[2:32:01] foreshadow of what's getting ready to
[2:32:03] come in this nation after a
[2:32:06] while and there won't be enough
[2:32:08] vaccinations in the world to stop what's
[2:32:09] coming next because brother BR said
[2:32:12] there' come a disease where they would
[2:32:13] rot in their own
[2:32:15] flesh that would make cancer look like a
[2:32:18] toothache
[2:32:21] friends if we're the bride and truly We
[2:32:25] believe We
[2:32:26] Are shouldn't we be practicing how to
[2:32:28] Anchor our faith down right now that's
[2:32:31] so if another great assault Came Upon
[2:32:33] This Nation or if another great thing
[2:32:35] Came Upon people that we wouldn't be
[2:32:37] sitting in our homes scared to death and
[2:32:40] worrying and biting the end of our
[2:32:41] fingernails off but we'd be sitting back
[2:32:43] there Bible open letting off the
[2:32:47] pressure he is my healer
[2:32:51] I've told you this before but when I
[2:32:53] went in the hospital going on four years
[2:32:55] now and as my lungs were eat alive with
[2:32:58] pneumonia first time I'd ever had it in
[2:33:00] my entire life I went in there and
[2:33:01] they're they're all scared to oh he
[2:33:03] going to die he going to die I was
[2:33:05] sitting in that little room waiting on
[2:33:06] them they put the little oxygen thing on
[2:33:08] my nose you know and I'm sitting in
[2:33:09] there and it just just for the first
[2:33:11] time I said to myself huh I could die
[2:33:13] over this
[2:33:14] maybe it just hit me maybe I could die
[2:33:18] huh okay
[2:33:20] oh
[2:33:21] well I didn't take it too seriously not
[2:33:24] really I just thought well death ain't
[2:33:26] no big deal that's all right death just
[2:33:29] ushered me into my new body I worryed
[2:33:31] about
[2:33:32] that and all at once I heard the Lord
[2:33:35] just I had a momentary just of fear
[2:33:37] just what about Sam and the girls what
[2:33:40] about my mom oh man my brother and them
[2:33:44] oh and I heard the Lord speak to me and
[2:33:46] say this is not a sickness unto death
[2:33:50] for the next seven days sitting in that
[2:33:51] hospital and then people walking in they
[2:33:53] had all their mask and everything on
[2:33:55] they come in they go how are you feeling
[2:33:58] today and you could just tell by the way
[2:34:00] they were acting this is a dead man in a
[2:34:02] few hours they'd come in I'd say what
[2:34:06] are you talking so softly for are you
[2:34:12] sick one nurse came in there just very
[2:34:15] quietly and and I'm not making fun of
[2:34:16] these people they did their job they
[2:34:17] wanted to do the best they could but but
[2:34:19] they didn't have the Revelation I did
[2:34:21] they come in real gingerly and that lady
[2:34:23] she picked up my arm and she rolled me
[2:34:25] over I felt like Paul Raider after a few
[2:34:28] minutes I said well honey turn it over
[2:34:29] and Jab that needle in there you ain't
[2:34:30] going to kill
[2:34:34] me the differences brother sister when
[2:34:37] we look away from all of the
[2:34:39] circumstances around us and put our eyes
[2:34:42] solely on what what he
[2:34:45] done then all of these Earthly Shadows
[2:34:48] can just disappear around us
[2:34:50] God fill us with this understanding Lord
[2:34:54] double triple quadruple portions fill
[2:34:56] every one of us with this understanding
[2:34:59] and may we walk out of here
[2:35:01] changed from knowing how to have the
[2:35:05] right kind of faith in God
[2:35:08] Amen let's stand
[2:35:10] together thank you for your time I know
[2:35:13] I've been a little lengthy but I I
[2:35:15] appreciate it very much
[2:35:19] glory to God think of it brother
[2:35:23] sister to have the ability to shut off
[2:35:26] the world behind them when they went
[2:35:27] into that inner
[2:35:29] Veil they pull those curtains behind
[2:35:31] them and had those little pomegranates
[2:35:32] on them and he go back here and take
[2:35:34] that blood back in
[2:35:36] there the Holy Spirit would come down
[2:35:38] and that fire and that smoke would go up
[2:35:40] through there you know what brother
[2:35:41] Brandon said when he got back in there
[2:35:43] he said that room was completely
[2:35:46] soundproof they couldn't hear him on the
[2:35:48] inside and they couldn't hear the
[2:35:50] outside couldn't be heard
[2:35:52] inside oh God shut my mind and my ears
[2:35:57] off to anything contrary to your word
[2:35:59] Lord shut it off to any inside voices
[2:36:02] any me voices any them voices and let me
[2:36:06] just concentrate and listen to only one
[2:36:08] voice and that's your voice
[2:36:10] Lord that my faith could rest in what
[2:36:13] you've
[2:36:14] done not what I'm
[2:36:17] doing CU you see friends we could live
[2:36:20] ever so healthy take somebody like Bruce
[2:36:22] Lee the guy was an epitome a physical
[2:36:26] specimen took one aspirin had a
[2:36:29] complication that killed him his boy
[2:36:30] done the same thing these men didn't
[2:36:32] have an ounce of fat on their body
[2:36:34] strong and
[2:36:35] healthy they said that many of the
[2:36:37] movies that Bruce Lee did they had to
[2:36:39] film some of them scenes in slow motion
[2:36:41] because he was so fast the camera
[2:36:44] couldn't even catch his punches and
[2:36:46] kicks took an aspirin and it killed him
[2:36:50] we could do take all the vitamins and do
[2:36:52] all the healthy stuff that we think we
[2:36:54] should do drink the juices and all of
[2:36:56] that might be okay but don't put your
[2:36:58] faith in things like
[2:37:01] that because you don't know what's
[2:37:03] working in your cells and what you've
[2:37:05] inherited what's been handed down and
[2:37:07] you don't know what the Lord will allow
[2:37:08] you to go
[2:37:10] through so don't put your faith in
[2:37:12] juices and pills and doctors
[2:37:16] and well if I have this surgery it's
[2:37:18] going to solve it all
[2:37:20] many have said that about a surgery come
[2:37:22] right out of the surgery need 10
[2:37:25] more my faith isn't in those things my
[2:37:28] faith is
[2:37:29] resting in the promise of
[2:37:33] God that said by his
[2:37:37] stripes I am already
[2:37:40] healed not what I
[2:37:43] done what he
[2:37:46] done let's pray together
[2:37:50] Lord Jesus thank you for your word this
[2:37:54] morning oh God thank you Lord for
[2:37:57] speaking to us like you
[2:38:00] have you've been so wonderful and so
[2:38:03] good
[2:38:06] Lord I'm so grateful for how you've
[2:38:11] spoken Lord when you put this on my
[2:38:13] heart to come bring here
[2:38:15] I I didn't fully understand it even but
[2:38:20] hearing these brothers talk and how much
[2:38:23] sickness has been around the church and
[2:38:24] things like that Lord looks like it's
[2:38:27] just a good season to bring these things
[2:38:29] in and then to hear that that's been the
[2:38:32] mind of the church here and the messages
[2:38:34] been following that pattern I pray that
[2:38:37] what's been said Lord will be
[2:38:38] complimentary to what's been done and
[2:38:41] accomplished may you take the word
[2:38:43] that's been preached today and may you
[2:38:46] just sink it deep into our hearts Lord
[2:38:50] father help us receive it as
[2:38:53] truth and help us set aside anything
[2:38:56] contrary to those those
[2:38:59] realities because Lord It's Easy for us
[2:39:01] to quote these things but Lord help us
[2:39:03] believe
[2:39:04] them take any Speck of Doubt out of us
[2:39:07] Lord let us be like the little man that
[2:39:09] said I believe but help thou my unbelief
[2:39:12] take anything contrary out of us
[2:39:14] Lord may your word just as it's visited
[2:39:17] the People by preaching
[2:39:19] May the word visit them in spirit as
[2:39:24] well may Lord Jesus you bring forth
[2:39:26] fruit from what's been
[2:39:29] preached help your children Lord help
[2:39:32] them many of them no doubt are
[2:39:34] struggling going through hard
[2:39:35] things diseases they've been battling
[2:39:37] their bodies things they've been
[2:39:38] battling their
[2:39:40] minds maybe someone that's young and
[2:39:42] healthy may not even think that way but
[2:39:44] they might be batt on an emotional
[2:39:46] thing which now the doctors and people
[2:39:48] in the medical Community now they call
[2:39:50] that just as much of sickness as they do
[2:39:52] the physical thing your Prophet told us
[2:39:54] that 60 years ago and here that plague
[2:39:58] of depression oppression nervousness
[2:40:00] fear it just moves on the young people
[2:40:02] as much as it does the other
[2:40:04] ones help us Lord God for you were
[2:40:08] wounded for our
[2:40:10] transgression bruised for our
[2:40:12] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[2:40:16] was upon
[2:40:17] you and by your strength stripes we
[2:40:19] already
[2:40:22] healed thank you Lord for what you've
[2:40:24] done for
[2:40:25] us and help all of us Lord no matter who
[2:40:28] we are may we just refocus in upon this
[2:40:34] reality I pray for myself I pray for
[2:40:38] them I want to put myself in there Lord
[2:40:40] too because I have physical needs just
[2:40:42] like they do probably maybe the names
