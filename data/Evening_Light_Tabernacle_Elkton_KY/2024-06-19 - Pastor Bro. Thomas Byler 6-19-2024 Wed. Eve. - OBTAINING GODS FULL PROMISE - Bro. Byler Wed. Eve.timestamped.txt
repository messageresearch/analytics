[1:01:18] other announcements so let's land amen
[1:01:20] go before the Lord in prayer and we'll
[1:01:22] try to get right into the service amen
[1:01:24] and so we'll just see what the Lord will
[1:01:26] have for certainly enjoyed brother
[1:01:28] Brad's message Sunday didn't we very
[1:01:30] very good outstanding message we really
[1:01:33] really appreciate it amen amen and we
[1:01:35] want to try to take off tonight amen
[1:01:37] Again part five brother Glenn amen anden
[1:01:41] we're going to talk amen about going
[1:01:42] into that Promised Land because I think
[1:01:44] we talked a little bit about the
[1:01:46] chastisement of the Lord and power
[1:01:48] without character is satanic and so God
[1:01:51] Amen is working on us amen because the
[1:01:54] gold that God is looking look for I
[1:01:56] consel Thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:01:59] the fire that thou mayest be rich amen
[1:02:02] and that uh you know that thou mayest be
[1:02:04] closed the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:02:07] appear and all of that and so the thing
[1:02:09] that God is looking for and once most
[1:02:11] out of us amen is our character because
[1:02:14] we know that's the only thing that we
[1:02:15] can take with us isin't that right amen
[1:02:18] and I want to talk with the help of the
[1:02:20] Lord in the aspect of the children of
[1:02:22] Israel and we want to talk a little bit
[1:02:23] about the Journey of the children of
[1:02:26] Israel typing even each and every
[1:02:29] individual amen as a Christian we go
[1:02:32] it's like the Christian walk is like a
[1:02:34] journey amen from the time that you're
[1:02:36] born again amen you're on a journey amen
[1:02:40] you're on a journey amen it might be
[1:02:42] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:02:45] of the Holy Ghost is it right amen and
[1:02:47] so we want to go into the promised land
[1:02:49] tonight amen and we want to talk a
[1:02:51] little bit about where we live is't that
[1:02:55] right because we're either living in the
[1:02:57] wilderness amen we're still in the
[1:02:58] wilderness maybe circling a mountain or
[1:03:01] whatever it might be going circling for
[1:03:02] 40 years some of us might be in the
[1:03:05] promised land I don't know just where
[1:03:06] you are but with tonight's help maybe
[1:03:09] the word of God will kind of show you
[1:03:11] where you are because it's important how
[1:03:13] many knows it's important for us to know
[1:03:16] where you are amen and the question it's
[1:03:19] a really big question is where do you
[1:03:22] live amen where are you living am me
[1:03:25] what's stage amen so amen I think um
[1:03:30] amen thank the Lord for amen a little
[1:03:34] microphone that works amen and so we'll
[1:03:38] just go before the Lord in prayer amen
[1:03:41] amen so let's bow our heads kind
[1:03:45] Heavenly Father we come before you Lord
[1:03:46] and so grateful Lord Jesus of all the
[1:03:49] great and precious promises that you
[1:03:51] have given us Lord Jesus father we want
[1:03:53] to look at some of those promises Lord
[1:03:55] Jesus J and looking at father coming
[1:03:57] into the full promise of God tonight
[1:04:00] Lord Jesus that Lord Jesus we don't know
[1:04:02] just where everybody is you do but we
[1:04:05] ask God that you'd help each and
[1:04:07] everyone that our objective and our
[1:04:09] purpose father our goal so to speak Lord
[1:04:12] is to go into that promised land and to
[1:04:14] walk with you Lord like Joshua and them
[1:04:17] did Father we ask Lord that you would
[1:04:19] just bless the reading of the word the
[1:04:20] meditation of our heart that which we
[1:04:22] feel you've laid upon our heart to
[1:04:24] minister tonight which is ask God that

[1:04:31] mind use my heart father and achieve
[1:04:34] your objective tonight for we ask it in
[1:04:37] Jesus name amen and amen amen there's a
[1:04:42] lot of quotes amen that I probably am

[1:04:50] to
[1:04:51] um if you will turn your Bibles to back
[1:04:54] to deuteron omy amen and I come up with
[1:04:57] this one here after since Brother Brad
[1:05:00] asked me of my scriptures Deuteronomy

[1:05:22] is taking so much I mean I taking so
[1:05:26] much and trying to cover so much ground

[1:05:33] the Lord Deuteronomy 2 and verse 1 then
[1:05:38] we turned and took our journey into the
[1:05:41] Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as
[1:05:43] the Lord spake unto me and and we

[1:06:11] yourselves therefore meddle not with
[1:06:14] them for I am not I will not give you of
[1:06:17] their of their land no not so much as a
[1:06:20] foot breath because I've given you mount
[1:06:23] seir I have given Mount Z
[1:06:26] unto Esau for a possession over in
[1:06:30] Romans 8 Romans 8 very familiar
[1:06:35] scripture in verse
[1:06:40] 29 8 and verse
[1:06:43] 29 for whom he did know he also did
[1:06:47] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:06:49] image of his son that he might be the
[1:06:51] firstborn among many Brethren may God
[1:06:54] add His blessings to the reading of the
[1:06:56] word you can be seated amen this evening
[1:07:01] amen amen praise the Lord amen so we
[1:07:05] basically want to go amen we want to
[1:07:07] talk just a little bit about how that we
[1:07:09] know that God when he called the
[1:07:11] children of Israel out of Egypt amen the
[1:07:14] first thing that he did amen of course
[1:07:16] called them out of Egypt they gave him a
[1:07:19] prophet amen Moses and he pulled them
[1:07:21] out of there and they begin a journey
[1:07:23] isn't that right a journey to the
[1:07:26] promised land amen and you and I amen
[1:07:29] also are on a journey to the promised
[1:07:32] land or I want to say to the full
[1:07:36] promise of God and I truly believe that
[1:07:38] the full promise of God to me anyway is
[1:07:42] going to be the translation of our
[1:07:44] bodies ain't that right because how many
[1:07:46] knows that's our goal that's our our
[1:07:48] objective amen I was going to I want to
[1:07:50] I want to First was going to call this
[1:07:53] achievable goals amen
[1:07:56] amen but I want to speak amen I titled
[1:07:58] it I think online if I'm not wrong amen
[1:08:01] the uh possessing the full promise of
[1:08:04] God going into the full promise of God
[1:08:07] so Israel begin their Journey amen and
[1:08:10] of course we know even as we mentioned
[1:08:12] last time that God begin to try them a
[1:08:16] that right he begin to test
[1:08:19] them amen and if I'm not wrong I don't
[1:08:22] have the scriptures tonight but uh I
[1:08:24] believe one place it talks about
[1:08:26] I believe after kades Baria God says
[1:08:28] these 10 times I believe it was have I
[1:08:31] tested and have I tried Israel ain't
[1:08:33] that right and these T about 10 times
[1:08:36] took God before he amen they took it
[1:08:39] back out into the Wilderness amen and
[1:08:41] let him all die and live there for 40
[1:08:44] years left them staying out there and
[1:08:47] die amen until all of those who were
[1:08:50] disbelievers and unbelievers amen had
[1:08:52] died out now another thought that come
[1:08:55] Comes This is this and that is that even
[1:08:57] after Joshua and Caleb even after they
[1:09:00] took their children back into the
[1:09:02] promised land we know that ultimately
[1:09:04] Israel backslid ain't that right amen
[1:09:07] served other gods and and and I believe
[1:09:10] either through Moses or one of the
[1:09:12] prophets they even prophesied and said
[1:09:14] that they would amen because God foresaw
[1:09:17] that they eventually would even get away
[1:09:18] from God Amen and even after being in
[1:09:21] the promised land after all that they
[1:09:23] had gotten they still got away from God
[1:09:26] Amen and as we look at ourselves going
[1:09:29] into the promised land there's a lot of
[1:09:31] examples amen given to us amen examples
[1:09:34] that we don't want to be like because I
[1:09:37] believe Paul in uh 1 Corinthians 10
[1:09:41] talked about these were our examples to
[1:09:44] the intent that we should not lust after
[1:09:46] evil things amen so God give us even in
[1:09:49] the New Testament examples of what we
[1:09:52] don't want to be like and I think I
[1:09:54] touched on it last time talking about
[1:09:56] you know we want to be this Samson amen
[1:09:58] used in the hands of almighty God is
[1:10:02] that right amen that God could use
[1:10:04] Samson in such a way to kill a thousand
[1:10:08] Philistines or even in his death after
[1:10:10] repenting more than that even but what a
[1:10:13] mighty man that Samson was when he was
[1:10:17] surrendered to God how that the power of
[1:10:19] God came down in a mighty way amen and
[1:10:22] he used him Amen to you know really
[1:10:25] bring forth the glory of what God can do
[1:10:28] when a man is completely surrendered to
[1:10:31] God the same way with Moses when he was
[1:10:33] surrendered you know but the opposite
[1:10:35] side of Samson was is that he had his
[1:10:38] heart was with Delilah he had given his
[1:10:40] strength to
[1:10:43] God Amen and how knows that when you are
[1:10:45] not completely surrendered to God heart
[1:10:48] mind soul and strength if you don't love
[1:10:50] the Lord thy God with all heart you'll
[1:10:52] end up amen having trouble
[1:10:57] we find that trouble is the same as
[1:10:59] Abraham had even though he's elected he
[1:11:02] was chosen just like you're elected like
[1:11:04] you're chosen amen of God still Abraham
[1:11:07] had a lot of trouble because he did not
[1:11:09] fully obey the word of
[1:11:14] God Amen because he says leave your
[1:11:17] father and mother leave your Kindred
[1:11:18] come out here and he brought his dad
[1:11:20] along brought lot along brought his
[1:11:22] nephew along and they had fusses and
[1:11:24] fights and all kinds of problems
[1:11:25] amen the head because that Abraham
[1:11:28] didn't fully obey Amen brother bam says
[1:11:30] he says you'll never never be fully
[1:11:33] blessed until you fully
[1:11:37] obey
[1:11:39] amen we in the message think about it we
[1:11:42] have been going on this journey for I
[1:11:44] I'm not sure maybe 53 something years
[1:11:46] since the prophet left it's been a
[1:11:47] little while isn't that right amen and
[1:11:51] the reason I read that in Deuteronomy is
[1:11:53] because a lot of our quotes will come
[1:11:54] from amen the message called Turn
[1:11:58] northward amen so let's start amen
[1:12:02] praise the Lord you love the
[1:12:04] Lord
[1:12:06] Amen brother bam says now he after
[1:12:09] reading Deuteronomy he says you know he
[1:12:11] wanted to he says now it would be hard
[1:12:14] for Israel to think that the promised
[1:12:16] land was 40 years away when they were
[1:12:19] standing on the other side of the Red
[1:12:21] Sea dancing shouting rejoicing
[1:12:25] and when they only they were only merely
[1:12:28] just a few days from it he said it isn't
[1:12:31] but just a very short time I think with
[1:12:33] an automobile you could probably drive
[1:12:36] it in about an hour and a half by
[1:12:38] walking you could make it in two days
[1:12:40] something like that something or other
[1:12:42] easy you could go on to the promised
[1:12:45] land amen again he says this and they
[1:12:49] were thinking that they were almost
[1:12:51] there and they were having a great
[1:12:54] Jubilee of sh outing and praising
[1:12:57] God and seeing what God had did for them
[1:13:00] and how that it had been hard it would
[1:13:02] be hard for them to make believe that
[1:13:03] there was 40 years from that promise to
[1:13:07] the full promise of God that he promised
[1:13:12] that's what we want to talk about IM
[1:13:14] comeing and possessing the full promise
[1:13:17] of God not just part of
[1:13:21] it amen uh when I when I pulled that up
[1:13:24] one Place brother bam says talking about
[1:13:26] turning northward he says one place and
[1:13:28] I didn't bring the quote but he says you
[1:13:29] know it's time to get away from all of
[1:13:31] that mountain and going in circle and so
[1:13:33] forth and go into the full promise of
[1:13:35] God where Jes where where Jesus said all
[1:13:38] things are possible to them that believe
[1:13:40] go and enter into a place where your
[1:13:43] prayers he said are answered God answers
[1:13:46] your
[1:13:47] prayer how many Jesus Jesus the promise
[1:13:50] one of the promises of God is if you
[1:13:53] abide in me and I
[1:13:56] in you you shall ask what you will and
[1:14:00] it shall be
[1:14:04] done so you ask well why is not God not
[1:14:07] answering my prayers amen well maybe
[1:14:09] you're not abiding him in him like you
[1:14:13] should all right so now notice he says
[1:14:17] there were 40 years it would be hard to
[1:14:19] imagine he said that Grace had provided
[1:14:22] them a great thing gra Grace had Pro
[1:14:25] provided them a Passover Lamb Grace had
[1:14:28] provided them a prophet and Grace had
[1:14:30] provided them an
[1:14:31] angel
[1:14:33] amen amen and the Passover Lamb was for
[1:14:37] their sins their Prophet was their
[1:14:39] instruction instructor the angel was
[1:14:42] their Guide G Grace had provided them
[1:14:45] everything for them but but in spite of
[1:14:48] all that they still wanted a
[1:14:52] law amen how many's glad for what Grace
[1:14:55] had
[1:14:56] provided it was right there right there
[1:14:59] at their
[1:15:01] fingertips listen to this this Israel is
[1:15:04] the spiritual just as God was talking to
[1:15:07] his people taking his people to a
[1:15:09] promised land in the natural he's taking
[1:15:11] his church to a promised land in the
[1:15:14] spiritual amen they was on their Road
[1:15:17] having a great time yet but and after
[1:15:19] Grace had been provided everything that
[1:15:21] they have need of yet they wanted
[1:15:23] something to do themselves something
[1:15:24] that they could show God they had
[1:15:26] something to do in it oh Church listen
[1:15:29] when it gets into that condition it's
[1:15:31] always when they lose out when you try
[1:15:34] amen any man tries to put his hand on
[1:15:37] the work of God or add something to it
[1:15:40] or take something away we must leave it
[1:15:42] just the way God provided it for us just
[1:15:45] let the Revival move on as the spirit
[1:15:48] moves on Amen these people were only 8
[1:15:52] to 10 days away from the full promise of
[1:15:54] God if they would have followed the
[1:15:56] leading of the holy spirit amen these
[1:16:00] people in this day our fathers was just
[1:16:02] a few days away from the fullness of the
[1:16:04] promise of God if they' have just kept
[1:16:06] following the leading of the spirit but
[1:16:09] they had to have something to do in it
[1:16:11] amen let me go back for just a minute I
[1:16:13] meant to say this amen a page back and
[1:16:15] that is amen Grace has supplied us for
[1:16:18] everything that you have need of the
[1:16:20] full baptism the full walk with God Amen

[1:16:42] next repentance it's the next confession
[1:16:45] it's the next full surrenderance to God

[1:16:50] inspiration away so to speak how many

[1:20:57] theology into God's spirit it takes
[1:21:00] God's spirit away amen that's the way it
[1:21:03] was in that day they were on the road
[1:21:06] but they wanted something they could do
[1:21:08] themselves oh they were fussing and
[1:21:10] through into all their carrying on they
[1:21:12] found out that they had drove the spirit
[1:21:14] of God away from them and it was a great
[1:21:16] mistake it was a great mistake when what
[1:21:20] we did the same thing our fathers when

[1:41:58] day it's the same through thing through
[1:42:00] it all they got to be part of it they
[1:42:02] can be an example of what God can do
[1:42:04] when men can come together and break
[1:42:06] their denominational barriers I believe
[1:42:08] that these men here that you see now I
[1:42:11] like to just go from there I believe
[1:42:13] that these men here that you see now
[1:42:16] these younger fellas why are these
[1:42:18] groups here it's the group of Sons of
[1:42:21] the old Fighters
[1:42:25] W how many sons of the old Fighters have
[1:42:28] we got here this morning I know you
[1:42:30] don't want to answer because you don't
[1:42:31] know where I'm
[1:42:34] going oh boy let's see what he says
[1:42:37] about him but these fellow are not
[1:42:39] Fighters the new group wasn't Fighters
[1:42:42] he let all the old Fighters die off when
[1:42:45] the old Fighters died off he took their
[1:42:47] sons and raised up among them a Joshua
[1:42:50] and sent them over to the full promise
[1:42:55] how many believes every promise in the
[1:42:57] book is mine every verse every chapter
[1:42:59] every and it's time that we come to the
[1:43:02] full promise of God come into the full
[1:43:04] stature of Christ Ephesians parallels
[1:43:07] Joshua Amen brother there's only about
[1:43:09] 12 people in the book of Ephesians am
[1:43:11] mean in the Ephesian church but they
[1:43:14] were mature you didn't have to tell them
[1:43:15] to quit fussing you didn't have to tell
[1:43:17] them the baby stuff no you could tell
[1:43:19] them about how that we were in God's
[1:43:21] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:43:25] world Amen it was time to go into the
[1:43:27] land and to be placed in that Land once
[1:43:30] you get into the Holy Ghost it's time
[1:43:32] that you get
[1:43:37] placed place where you're supposed to
[1:43:40] be
[1:43:44] amen there ain't nothing as good young
[1:43:46] people there ain't nothing as good as
[1:43:48] finding the place that God wants you to
[1:43:51] be finding your place
[1:43:56] in the body of Christ like I said that's
[1:43:59] a whole subject in itself but God wants
[1:44:01] to place us when we get into the
[1:44:03] promised land but let's go back here we
[1:44:04] won't get into that just
[1:44:06] yet that's right raised up them of
[1:44:10] Joshua and sent them over to the full
[1:44:13] promise I believe that's what we are
[1:44:16] seeing
[1:44:18] today
[1:44:20] 2024 I guess it is almost Los and track
[1:44:23] we're down the road so far is that right
[1:44:27] but can we see I believe that there's a
[1:44:29] group
[1:44:33] here that we're seeing today I believe
[1:44:37] that's what this Christian businessman
[1:44:38] is who saying them but I just want to
[1:44:40] apply to us amen praise the
[1:44:43] Lord but listen he's trying to get you
[1:44:47] away from that Old Fighter's
[1:44:50] disposition amen

[1:52:54] and everything that he had to go through
[1:52:56] he says they wouldn't want
[1:52:58] it they couldn't take it why because

[1:54:18] many people out of their place amen
[1:54:22] listen listen to this I'm going
[1:54:24] to try to make it short how did God have
[1:54:28] set some the church through labor pains
[1:54:31] they get tremendous sometimes when a
[1:54:33] church is groaning under the persecution
[1:54:35] of the outside world Believing on the
[1:54:37] Lord Jesus and the promise of the Holy
[1:54:39] Ghost is just as real to us as it was to
[1:54:42] Pentecost how they groan and cry under
[1:54:44] labor pains but when they are born
[1:54:47] they're positionally born into the
[1:54:48] kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has
[1:54:50] to set in the church some apostles
[1:54:52] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[1:54:55] speaking in tongues interpretation of
[1:54:57] tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[1:54:58] healing all kinds of Miracles how many
[1:55:00] knows there's many different things that
[1:55:02] God places in the church helps
[1:55:08] governments what did butam said people
[1:55:11] would go in the room they say they were
[1:55:12] seeking something she said don't seek
[1:55:14] nothing if God's got something for you
[1:55:16] to know just hold still he'll get your
[1:55:18] attention he'll get you to do it just

[1:55:32] place in this great Army in this great
[1:55:35] Promised Land we all have our place I
[1:55:38] believe you sitting there you're sitting
[1:55:39] in your place where God wants
[1:55:44] you and if you are it's just like the
[1:55:48] army man it's in when it's put in proper
[1:55:52] proper array swords Shields ain't that
[1:55:57] right I remembers how they would take
[1:55:59] these shields cover themselves up the
[1:56:01] guy behind him would bringing it up they
[1:56:02] could fling all the arrows they wanted
[1:56:04] to him unless it ricocheted or got lucky
[1:56:06] he wouldn't come in then theyd open up
[1:56:09] just enough to go in and slaughter them
[1:56:12] it was hard to
[1:56:13] penetrate that's the way it is with a
[1:56:15] church when everybody is in their place
[1:56:18] the devil can't hardly penetrate he's
[1:56:20] trying
[1:56:22] but God help us keep us protected keep
[1:56:25] the shield of Faith up and let's quench
[1:56:29] all the fiery darts of the wicked even
[1:56:32] better B said he said when everybody
[1:56:34] every thought no evil thought no
[1:56:37] cigarette smoked no short dressed women
[1:56:40] no evil thoughts everything in harmony
[1:56:43] the Holy Spirit can
