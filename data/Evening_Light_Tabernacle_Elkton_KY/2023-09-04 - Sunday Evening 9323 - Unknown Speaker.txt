at the clock you give me one hour okay give me one hour or less and if you'll do that we'll get out of here and not that we're trying to run not we're trying to get out of here that didn't sound good but you know what I mean I know you're tired it's been a uh we're not used to these kind of services and just to be honest we we probably work more during the week than we should everybody and and uh strenuous and so uh we'll get into the word here and get get you home and get you a little rest enjoy your holiday weekend I hope everybody gets a little time off tomorrow and and uh be able to enjoy your day um I want to speak again we're going to try to finish up my thought that I've been studying on Joshua I thought it was good that all the other ministers have been hitting on this brother Byler and and brother Andrew and brother Zach and it just seems like it's just been a it's just been it's been good for me I'll say it that way and Trust you've enjoyed it too um start with this quote here and don't want to keep you standing long but we will be reading out of Joshua chapter 6. says if there's no battle then there's no victory he said but you gotta have a battle to have a victory if it was just given to you it wouldn't be no Victory he said but he that overcometh is the one who has the victory so Jesus came to the Earth he had a battle he won the Victory and tonight we have a battle and with Christ we have the victory now the Lord bless you he said amen Joshua chapter 6. there's nothing like a victory after a battle is it amen we're going to talk about Jericho here so chapter six now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thine hands Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor and you shall come past the city all you Men of War and go round about the city once thus shall do six days and the Seven priests shall bear the before the ark seven trumpets of ram Ram's horns and the seventh day ye shall Compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the Ram's Horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the Cities shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every man straight before him now that sounds unreasonable doesn't it in our minds it's it's just it's it's it's unreasonable it's unfathomable it's impossible and Joshua the son of nine called the priests and set up said unto them take up the Ark of the Covenant again Joshua he knew from from previous time we got to keep going God first so immediately take up the Ark of the Covenant and let seven priests bear the seven trumpets of Ram's horns before the Ark of the Lord and he said unto the people pass on and come past the city and let them let his arms pass on before the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass when Joshua had spoken unto the people that seven priests bearing seven trumpets of Ram's horns passed on before the Lord and blew with the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and rear rearward came after the ark the priests going on and blowing the trumpets and Joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout or make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you to shout then shall ye shall I thought it was a amazing statement when brother Zach was preaching and he was talking about that and he brought it out that how can you imagine walking around the city day after day and you can't utter a word and that that that's an amazing feat we we're human beings we like to talk we like to laugh we like to cut up no they did not utter a word not a sound come out of them and so the Ark of the Lord can pass the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp and Joshua Rose early in the morning the priest took up the Ark of the Lord and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of Ram's horns before the Ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and armed men went before them and rearward came after the Ark of the Lord the priest going on and blowing the trumpets and the second day they can pass the city once and returned into the camp so they did six days day after day after day and he came to pass on the seventh day that they Rose early and about the dawning of day and Compass the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they compasted can pass the city seven times and it came to pass on the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord hath given you the city now at this time they're still sitting on the outside they're still looking at big huge walls but he says shout because the Lord has given you the city and the city shall be accursed even it and all is therein the Lord only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all that's all with her house in in the house because she hid The Messengers that we sent and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing this is important here keep yourself from the accursed thing let yours let lest you make yourselves a curse then you take of the accursed thing and make and make a camp of Israel curse and trouble it and we know what happened in the future Aiken began to take a wedge that he didn't need to take and ended up cursing the whole tribe the whole Camp there until they had to find out kill him Stone him and brother Byler brought that out last week but all the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the Lord they shall come into the treasury of the Lord so the people shouted when the priest blew the Trump but then it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city you may have your seeds may the Lord had the blessings of the reading of the word Kingdom Builders tonight we're going to talk about tearing down the walls and just to give you a little bit of brief history and some some signs like I told you this morning I love it when science can prove the scriptural's Cur the scripture is correct I began to look at this and thinking about Jericho and I just digging into the Jericho and what they found there and back in 1907 to lay a little bit of foundation for you the archaeologists go in and they're trying to excavate and and go through the ruins of Jericho and to go in there and between 1907 and 1940 I think it was and they're trying to look at this site because people have tried to dis dispel they've tried to say that this was all just a story that this really didn't happen that this is impossible and to just the reader of of the of the war or the book it may appear that way it may appear possible it sounds unreasonable How could a city fall upon the shouting of just a an army of people but as the archaeologists began to dig and they began to find they've found Jericho and as they begin to dig they say they found that the the walls definitely tumbled at all at one time they could tell that the way the rubble failed that it was an instant falling of the walls so they began to dig a little closer and say maybe something here really really did happen and as they begin to go through there they found pots of grain we know that this happened right after the Harvest Right the rivers were swollen because of the Harvest they found pot after pot after pot of stored grain now back in those days if you was going to go through a town and destroy it and you was going to take over the city what is one of the things you think would be a hot come on grain but what did the word of God tell children of Israel not to do don't touch anything you leave everything except for the gold the silver the brass the iron and you put that in God's Treasury somebody said nobody in history would ever go through and destroy a city and not take the grain so there's fact number one or two however you want to put that they also also said he told them to burn the city destroy it burn everything within there let the city be burnt three feet deep of Ashes the city completely annihilated and this one here is one that I think is uh one of the most important things two things they didn't find any gold any silver any brass any iron all that was gone but the one thing that they did find they found one little house on the north side of a wall and they couldn't figure out where is this why is this one house standing around this Nine Acre City when every bit of the walls have tumbled down so they had to go back into scripture and try to figure this out and they began to look and they found right here in Chapter 2 of Joshua verse 15 then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon that wall Rahab the Harlot had a little house up on the North side of Jericho and she hid the spies under the Under The Canopy of her house until they came and they began to spot out what did she do but she let them down so there was one house in this whole city that was not under Rubble that was not under ashes then it stood there all by itself God keeps his promises brother Branham said he's there's the land he said and yet some of the Israelites when they looked at it they said well we can't take it we look like grasshoppers upside them big people and the spies came back Joshua and Caleb they knew the God had said and they said we can take it it's ours he said well Jericho was so big so they could run two chariots around it the horse race and how could we go up there with our little Spears and so forth ain't that the way we think about ourselves sometimes how can we go up there as insignific as I am how can I face Satan and all of his Wiles and all of his demons and all of his negativity how can I face that being the little person I am how can we do it he said how can we do with our little spheres the gates are shut up great men in there giants Canaanites probably the descendants of ham how could we ever go in and take that he said they looked at the natural part and he says and this is this is Brother Brown I'm speaking now he says but let me ask you how could this woman walk he's fixing to have a prayer line how could this woman walk how could that one walk how could this man who's fixing to die in the next few days with heart trouble how can he be made well right now it's unreasonable you can't reason it out he said you can't reason it out God isn't known by reason and no man understands it but you've got to accept it by faith we've got to accept what God is going to do in our lives by faith he said it's so it's against science and it's against knowledge the knowledge of this world is foolishness before God it's against all scientific research for a virgin to bring forth a child he said but she did it scientific you know scientists always catching up and and I don't know that this to be factual I caution on even bringing it out but they actually think they had found a portion of a drop of blood that could have belonged to Jesus Christ and they began to examine it through the through the DNA research and they run it through DNA Time After Time After Time and they found that the DNA and that blood sample for one was alive after all these years it was living it was a living organism number two it only had DNA that involved a lady a female it had the mother's side of the DNA Jesus was neither Jew or Gentile there was no no male to put DNA in but there was an extra Y chromosome that made it male it's the only known DNA in in the in history now I can't tell you that's true I can't tell you it's factual but it makes a lot of sense because Jesus was neither Jew nor Gentile and so here we're looking at this and and brother Brown was beginning to talking about this and he says nobody understands it he says but he'll give you this promise it's yours he said every one of you was healed 1900 years ago at Calvary every one of us sitting here in this building it's a finished work we've known that we've heard that because now it's time for us to believe that and step into what God has in place for us 1900 years ago at Calvary I know there's a whole lot of Briars growed up in here A whole lot of Canaanites he says it says the days of Miracles has passed and he said I don't believe in them Holy Rollers he says but go in and take it it's yours get God give it to you it's a promise take it anyhow he said if God said so what do you care about what the Canaanites think if you believe that God can do something in your life if you believe God can give you your healing what do you care about what the doctors think if you believe that God can come in and deliver you from from a a a a habit or a spirit or something that's in your life what do you care what your neighbor thinks I don't care what anybody thinks as long as God is pleased with me and the what how a worship and approach God it doesn't matter about my my neighbor it doesn't matter about my brother it doesn't matter about my sister it's me and God that individual relationship he says those long-faced people say the Miracles the days of Miracles has passed it isn't for them it's for the believer so when people tell you I don't believe in miracles they're right it's not for them they will never receive a miracle but Believers are are under the obligation of God that if you if you desire if you believe it and God promised you something in your life he's going to stand like he's going to perform form exactly what he said brother Brown said a guy ask him said brother Brandon I don't believe it he said it wasn't for you can you imagine saying that to the prophet I don't believe this well it's not for you he said it's only for believers not unbelievers he just set himself up didn't he it's not for you it's for it's not it's not for you it's for believers it's it's unbelie you're an unbeliever he said so go ahead take it I'll send my fear before you I like that when Joshua Was preparing to go in brother Brown said God said go ahead and take it I'll send it my fear before you my angel will prepare a way a lot of times we think we don't have a way we don't have a an in or an out or how we're going to accomplish this but if God is willing to send his Angel before you and God is willing to send an angel of fear upon all your enemies what have you got to fear so here's Joshua and and Joshua and the children of Israel now have crossed over into the Jordan they've set up a the crossover the Jordan River they set up a memorial to remind everybody of what God has done for them and God comes down once again and appears to Joshua God's coming down to give him a fresh account of what's about to happen you know we need that in our lives you may you may overcome a challenge yesterday there's one waiting around the corner and we need God to be constantly fresh in our lives so that we can know that he's there for us and God appeared to Joshua to give him encouragement to give him strength to help him to carry on in the task that's about to happen and God appeared and he comes down here and he says listen Joshua I've got a strategy for you and I want you to follow this strategy and if you'll follow this strategy the people of Israel will have victory you know God always tells his people what to expect he don't leave his people in the dark that's why we had a message in the hour that we're living in it's so that there would be no confusion so that there would be no darkness that we would have to wonder what in the world is this going to be like what is going to happen when the Rapture takes place what is going to happen if this happens over here and this happens over here what are we to expect what's Heaven going to be like we've been given a clear picture God God don't leave anybody out he wants you to know what's about to happen and Joshua needed this encouragement because of this challenge that laid ahead of him here Joshua was in a tight spot you might say he's unfound himself done got over the river and boy you think he would take a deep breath and think goodness this is over but now the real challenge lays ahead a fortified City a difficult task here's Jericho and Joshua knows that this is the oldest inhabited city in the world it's city the city that stood with two massive walls constructed of stone and brick and and the outer wall stood there as a sign to tell everybody that I will not be conquered if a city could speak that's what he would say I will not be conquered and he stands there and he begins to look at this and he looks at he says you know this this is impenetrable and Joshua knew that the city was impenetrable and he knew he was facing this wall and you know brothers and sisters it sure sounds like a lot of times in our lives because we constantly are looking ahead of the challenges that we face you know tomorrow what challenge could lay ahead of you I know tomorrow what challenge could lay ahead of me sometimes those challenges are difficult sometimes those challenges are frightening sometimes those challenges uh give us a feeling of great uncertainty in our lives because we know that something is about to happen and we need God we need God to get us through and we look here at this wall ahead of us and we wonder how are we ever going to break through this this wall is too big it's too we can't get through it we can't get over it we can't get under it I'm standing here looking at a challenge that I cannot defeat here's God's plan delivered to Joshua Joshua wondered what what in the world's next what are we going to do here how are we going to how are we going through this city you know God's plan wasn't a plan to rush in there and and and try to surprise them and take them by take them by force and rush into the City and say oh here we are we're here to attack but a lot of times we in our lives we try to fight our battles that way we try to get in a hurry we try to rush and God's on my side so here we are let's fight if Joshua and the children of Israel had went up there and stormed that City if they would have went up there and stormed that City and think they're going to take it by force the the death toll would have been innumerable they would have been slaughtered one after another after another after another but God didn't do that God told Jose Joshua March around the city once a day for six days slow down March around the city uh for six days and then uh and then March around seven times on the seventh day see God's plan always involves preparation and the time of sanctification cleaning and so God here is now trying to get to get them ready and brother sister that's the way it is in our hour with the bride the bride is taking time right now she's preparing herself and I know we've heard we've heard that for years but if you look at what's happening in the world if you look at what's happening in the church world if you look at what's happening in the message world we're here we're on the brink of something that the world has dreamed of that the world has anticipated that the world has known and is going to expect to happen for the whole time that Christ has been gone Christ is coming back and we're in anticipation for it here Joshua tells the priest to carry the Ark of the Covenant carry the Ark of the Covenant and and have your armed men before and go and have your arm in Africa why would you think he would do that I think God wanted to let it be known to the whole Jericho City that here is God's anointed people here is God's anointed Army and we're standing outside of your Gates and we're here to take you over he also wanted the Israelites to see that the faithfulness to God's plan you know it may not always be in our timing but God does deliver his results listen and waiting on God that's a hard thing for us to do that's a hard thing for us to do we have a need in our life we have a challenge we have something that we need to happen it needs to happen right now in our minds and it's a hard thing for us to sit and wait we want instant everything's instant we got an instant coffee we got instant tea we got uh instant microwaves we got instant everything is instant instant instant and when we don't get things instantly we get discouraged we don't get things instantly we begin to stress when we gonna get things instantly we begin to get all worried and frazzled and think man how is this ever going to work out and Joshua's sitting here and God saw him March around the city March around the city March around the city you know brothers and sisters we already read how Jericho was shut down they were shut down they had fear upon them they were boarded up because Israel was so near they knew who Israel was they knew the children of God they knew what God was capable of you say well how do you know that because Rahab said in Chapter 2 she said We Know Who You Are we know who you are and I've had a change of heart we know the destruction you cause we know what you've done to Pharaoh we know what you've done to Egypt so they knew exactly who the children of Israel was as they become men and here they become to Simply March around the city March March March no utterance of anything March March March and can you imagine the the soldiers in the Jericho I can just think about them being up on top of the city walls looking down on this and thinking man when are they going to strike when are they going to strike what is their strategy what are they doing why are they just keep walking around where are they going to jump over the walls where where is the attack going to come from Nightfall nothing day two they come out and they begin to walk around again Walk and Walk and Walk and they begin to do this day after day after day after day now what seemed frightening at the first now turns into mockery can you imagine the children of Jericho as they watch this hey are you guys ever going to do anything why you keep walking around do you even have any weapons can you imagine as I sit there and they can't speak you know in our minds we'd be like I'll just show you you just wait a minute wait till my God comes on the same no they just kept walking and they keep mocking them hey are you guys ever gonna fight we're so we're soldiers we're ready for you we're what are you waiting for and they March and they March and they March do you see the importance of waiting on God you see God's got a plan and only the only way that God can fulfill his pain if we're willing to wait on God we have to wait and let God do it in his time but they're being made fun of and they're being mocked and we don't like that do we now we don't like it when people make fun of us when they mock us and and the world mocks us and and and Christianity is being hit so hard and and the message is being hit so hard the message is under constant scrutiny yep it's under constant scrutiny for what you believe and what you what you live the way you dress the way you act the way you talk under constant scrutiny and here's the children of Israel walking around under the scrutiny look at you look at you what happened to that God we've heard so much about was that all a myth about Egypt every day but unfortunately for Jericho there was a seventh day and on that seventh day it began to tell us that on that on that seventh day they marched around the city seven times and on the same time the priest blew the trumpets and Joshua said shout for the Lord has given you the city can you imagine the roar that swept through that little village that little Valley down through there on the in between the banks of the river of Jordan and the walls of the city of Jericho can you imagine the Roar the swept through there I met those soldiers didn't have much to say about that time because as that wall began to rumble and the Earth began to Quake at the shout and the sound of the trumpets and the next thing you know that wall comes down and God gave them the victory as simple as it sounds that's how simple it is in our lives sometimes we just have to stand on the word sometimes we got to keep our mouths shut sometimes we got to wait on God and then just wait and let God do his thing [Applause] these people went up into the city I like this part the people went up into the City and every man straight before himself he went up there and took the city you know because before it was all Moses right they followed Moses they done what Moses said Moses was the leader Moses was the one that was looked up to next it was yahshua Joshua was the next leader he was the next one that they looked up to he'd done his part he was powerful but now it says they each and every one of them went up into the oh they were everyday Believers brothers and sisters everyday Believers Housewives men farmers they all went up there they all had their part in this battle under the leadership of God now they have taken it upon them they have a part they have a plan they have a part in this plan of God and brother sisters we need people to realize and know their part in the plan of God we need Warriors Prayer Warriors people women men children who will get a list of the prayer needs and dedicate themselves to pray and pray and pray pray for the Saints pray for the services pray for God's moving in our midst we need people we need singers who are anointed to sing the Praises of God to our anointed that can bring down the anointing of God into our song services and into to the lives of the young people and the children and people in this church so that if God becomes real and they can enter into a place of worship that's what we call tearing down walls these people of Jericho they saw God's power in an instant we want instant they got instant the people of Jericho now knew that there was a god they knew that God could deliver and they knew as these walls come tumbling down oh what a great God this is oh what a great God they serve and this is a great story not just for them but for us it's a great story that leads us into victory there's some keys Into the Book of Joshua that I want to look at that we've been talking about over the last little bit Joshua 1 3 we've learned to step out on faith 1-3 says to every place of your father that your foot walks the soul s your foot she'll walk there upon your own Joshua 1 8 says meditate on God's word meditate therein day and night how much more important is that for us to get in the word day in and day night Joshua 1 9 says don't be afraid be strong of good courage be not afraid because God is with you we've learned in these little things we've heard them but now it's time to apply them Joshua 3 3 put God first the Ark of the Covenant go after it let the presence of God go before you have a fresh encounter with Christ Joshua 5 14. Joshua falls on his face and worships trusting God for a miracle Joshua 6 5 Shout with a great shout in the wall of the city shall fall flat down so it's time to take these things to Heart take these words to heart we read in the Book of Joshua we read about how after they conquer Jericho it was an easy win do you ever think about how easy that wind was 13 times they walked around the city in seven days and the walls tumbled down nobody hurt nobody killed they take the city they burn the city they get the spoils everything's good but what we fail to realize and what we failed to remember sometimes is that that wasn't their last battle they didn't stop in Jericho do you know they took over 30 more cities they took over 30 more cities and had 30 more victories day after day there was something constantly they were having to battle and they went and they took these cities some of them were hard fought battles some of them were injuries sustained some of them death was the same but the victory was still God's you see you may be facing challenges in your life in my life I face them and when I think about this story it reminds me that just like the children children of Israel with God going before me I cannot fail with God going before you you cannot fail you can have the victory brother Brown said notice he said I want you to notice that Joshua had a Victory Day at the river Joshua had a Victory Day at the river he said he had a Victory Day at the Jericho too he certainly did there is where he crops and he had that Victory Day in the month of April when it was a mile across he said no doubt the enemy would have said God is quite a general isn't he leads his army up to that River when it's at its worst he said and when it's the worst time to cross then God the general leads his army up there to let him cross he said God lets disappointments happen we don't like that [Applause] we don't like that but he says God lets those disappointments happen to show victory if I could only see that he said if you could only see it seems to be blurring you and upsetting you their trials he said they are things to stand still and focus your glasses on the word of God speak the word and then just walk forward let me tell you there's many times in our lives we don't have the answer we don't know what to do there's times when we just sit there and we think Lord I'm in a pickle I'm I'm just like Joshua I done found myself in a tight spot and we said and we wonder how are we going to get through that's when we have to stop and say God I Lay My Life down to you I lay my everything down to you and I dedicate myself to you and however we get through this you'll get the glory you'll get the victory he says Israel went to battle the first thing they went forth was singers and singers went forward they blowed the trumpet so we need singers we need trumpets we need musicians he said they blow the trumpets and so forth the art moved up he said the art moved up they set the ark down and the battle started he said God told him as I was with Moses so I will be with you and there you are with a commission from God put the word first and it brought a victory day oh it's got to come he said he put the word first and what happened the ark went down into the water and the river opened up and they crossed he said what happens when I get there the next thing they're going to take place he gets over there on the other side then he finds out they're all walled in because of the fear when it comes over him but the next thing he met the chief if we can just get in contact with the chief Captain when our battles are raging when things are not going our way we get in contact with the chief captain he says the natural man looking through the glass there says now you brought me over here here I am look at the opposition they're on the inside they're with their slings they're close to the wall woe unto us they got rocks they got big slings they got Spears they got bows they got everything laying in there but Joshua just put God first and isn't that how you're going to get there that's up to God just keep moving and following he said March seven days and on the seventh day March seven times and the last time around sound the trumpet God's place to take the natural way and the spiritual moved in the walls fell they went right straight up and they took the thing yes sir they had their Victory Day aren't you thankful for the victory days of sand to our feet simple thought tonight but as we bring the walls down take it home with you and when you're challenged in this next week and you don't know which way to turn in your walls and your chasing facing obstacles remember these scriptures or remember that it didn't take a a mighty Army full of Weaponry it didn't take a mighty Army to come in and destroy the the Jericho soldiers and to bring the walls down it just simply took a a man and women and children of God to walk and to walk into God's plan follow God's word and keep beef God first let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for the word this morning we thank you for the word this afternoon Lord we

each and every one of us on a day-to-day basis but Lord help us not lean into our own understanding and help us not to lean into our own ways of thinking when it comes to overcoming these battles or whether it be sickness fear doubt rage anger whatever our battles are you know them Lord I don't know them I could go on with the list Lord but you know each and each and every individual here you
