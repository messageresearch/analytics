oh foreign alright foreign so i'll just stand this morning maybe brother joe will open us in prayer this morning children can be dismissed for sunday school if you'll go in the psalms with me to psalms 57 psalms 57 be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed you shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and his truth be thou exalted oh god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth my heart is fixed oh god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations this one together be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth god bless you may be seated brother danny sunday school morning everyone happy mother's day um today is mother's day and so this is a message by brother branham about a mother's love for children when i said that humble little woman for the first time this ever happened the third pull upon a human being was a little humble woman that making about 200 a year for her living all she got out of her her little farm her husband dead two children that had turned kind of wild and come and donated twenty dollars of that to the building of this tabernacle and and meta had given me some money that morning for groceries twenty dollars and i was going to give it back to her that day while i was down there so that she wouldn't have to pay it but she wouldn't take it and when she she was sitting back in the corner and when when i said only thing i know is he is still jehovah jireh and still hattie said the right word she said that's nothing but the truth and when she said that brother banks would he here's one one that was present that room felt like it was coming apart and the holy spirit said the same voice that spoke about the squirrels said give her what she asked for and i said sister hadi as a witness before god this is it now if there's any doubt in your mind you ask what you want to and if it ain't ain't laid on in your lap then i'm a false prophet she said brother branham everybody was crying said what shall i ask i said you you are poor you live on on the hill over there with no money you might ask for that you got a little crippled sister sitting there edith that we prayed for for years you might ask for her healing i said your your father and mother is old and broke down you might ask for them whatever you ask for sister hattie see see now if it happens or not right now and i say said he has just told me the same voice said give her what she asked for and she looked around said what shall i say brother branham i said say what what your desire is think of your greatest desire and say that and say it and her her boys and what was even snickering and and laughing and she said the greatest desire i have is the salvation of my two sons i said i give them to you in the name of jesus christ and there they went and and they being faithful in this church with communion and them little fellows sitting there washing feet with the men and things like that we are all witnesses of that she had a real choice her her mother has to die so so does she all of them but what she asks what she asks will be eternal in the salvation of her children that was the third time it happened amen and that shows a real genuine love a mother has for her her children and that that's the most important thing that that you could ever ask for is the salvation of someone and and with that with that all the things that that she could have asked for think of it she could have been decided to be she wanted to be a millionaire she wanted to have have anything but but what she asked for or what was more important than anything god knew what she she would ask for that's why brother brandon and that's why god told brother brandon that that she could ask for what whatever she wanted and and so she she asked for something that that's eternal and and and she got it amen and what what would it if if i was given that option i don't know what i would would have asked for and but a a but a woman and and that has children that that's the most important thing that that she could have asked for amen so um thank you brother steve amen we're sort of a few in number today but like i told brother brad i feel like the lord is with us and that's the main thing let's uh i'm going to go on and read a praise report we got here from sister john east it says praise the lord jesus for letting the doctor to know what to do to get my heart back in rhythm like it should be i preach i i appreciate you all for keeping me in your prayers that's sister john easton sure good to see her here this morning so we just thank the lord for that amen [Applause] and for prayer requests all i actually have is brother brian's sister jeanette contacted us and said that uh he was having some extreme pain in his leg and uh they were taking him to the to see check his blood pressure and see what was going on with that so let's just remember him in prayer today also and then for the many people that are traveling uh just they'll have traveling mercies and most of all like brother danny's sunday school

they what they know what they can to get people prepared for what's ahead amen let's turn number 83 the lily of the valley [Music] i have found a friend in jesus he's everything to me these are

we tarry there none other has ever known [Music] [Applause] amen appreciate that brother glenn i was just thinking when he was singing it i think everybody in here i mean i don't know everybody i don't know all your past or how you were raised but being in america i think everybody in here was taught from youth up that there was a god i don't think any of us in here had to be changed no matter what denomination it was what not none of us had to go from a statue or an idol to and you know that's really a blessing to be taught from youth that there is a god and that everything that you see in nature and everything uh there's a there's a being that created all of that and there's a reason for it so and you know most of the people that taught you that was always mama yeah it's always come to your mother that's just a blessing let's sing amazing grace as brother thomas gets ready to come out just appreciate all the visitors we have today [Music] sister sherry's daughter my sister sitting over there and sister dave's mom i know she's blessed to have her with us [Music] let's just stand if we're good [Music] it's amazing grace how sweet the sound that says [Music] but now [Music] i see it was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace [Music] that [Music] feeling [Music] [Music] i am it was grace that brought [Music] and grace will lead me home good morning [Music] to be in the house of the lord amen good to have a beautiful beautiful day again amen god bless you amen i think that'll be all for the music amen so we appreciate the musicians and everybody this morning amen get to see everybody that's here different ones or some of them with their mothers and so forth and and so forth but anyway so happy mother's day amen let's all give all our mothers a hand say god bless you amen amen motherhood the backbone of a nation amen right the backbone why why is it the backbone it's because of what they teach their children you got it right brother glenn what the way that they raise their children the next generation is what that nation is going to become and so when you're teaching that little child good and bad and right and wrong you remember you're building that backbone feeling that backbone amen every time you give him a good weapon you're building that backbone amen every time you show them love and give them a hug you're building that backbone amen how many knows love and discipline goes a long way amen so god bless you mothers it's good amen amen i don't really have a specific message towards mothers but amen we do wish them a good blessed blessing upon them amen also brother brad said that he had his truck out here i've seen if you'll notice on the back of his flatbed there he's got a lot of flowers so brother brad and sister joyce and the family there they want to give every all the mothers a flower so you can go home and plant it amen and so be blessed god bless you brother brad and sister joyce for doing that amen so everybody just grab your flower down there they said amen praise the lord god is good isn't he amen let's pray lord jesus we come before you this morning with thankful hearts lord once again to be able to assemble ourselves together lord jesus and father just knowing and believing with all of our heart wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you will be in our midst lord we just pray father that you'll bless the service this morning lord and we ask god that you'll take any hindering spirit lord under your control lord jesus that you might have liberty to speak and to say just what you once said lord we ask god that you would take supreme control and preeminence in every portion of the service help me lord just to get out of the way lord jesus that you could operate the gift lord jesus in me and may the people be blessed and may we be closer to you father after this morning for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and thank you lord for touching sister john east amen praise the lord amen i'm so glad i thought you know i just i thought well we need to remember that and thank the lord and give her and give the lord a round of applause and y'all did that when we're in there so i thought that's exactly right praise the lord sometimes we need to shock to get our heart pounding right again and don't we amen well that's the way spiritually a little bit amen my message this morning is going to be on the power of light and the power of darkness amen we're going to talk about light it meant darkness and the power and what it really means what really those two powers uh do what consists of darkness what makes darkness and what makes light amen and the power of each would that be okay so if you will turn to isaiah if you will isaiah 63 amen amen the prophet of god used this scripture and speaking on it is the rising of the sun amen and we'll just try to read a few scriptures a little foundation and just let god have his way amen and i trust that you will enjoy this this morning uh isaiah 60 arise and shine i hear some isaiah 60. did i not tell you the scripture okay isaiah 60 60 isaiah 60 not 63 what's 63 god nope all right i believe 60 is what i'm looking for i mean some of those sometimes those have i mean about talk about the same thing but all right arise and shine for the light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee amen how many believes that how many believes he was speaking to you there that quote that scripture is for you and it's for me amen now this is for somebody else are you ready verse 2 for behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people my but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen and the gentiles shall come to thy light and the kings to the brightness of thy arising may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen praise be to the lord but abandonment preaching the rising of the sense son said it this way he was speaking to the bride the church that had come out he talked about how did he said shalom which means peace to you amen peace god's peace rest upon you to the elected and so forth that's who i'm addressing it to amen he says now we're facing here our two subjects that we read of the scriptures very contrast one to another it says arise and shine for the glory of god has come upon thee thy light is here very next verse he says but is gross it's darkness upon the world and mine notice how he makes a distinction how that there is a darkness upon the world but there's gross darkness upon the people amen all right so oh so then now notice he says so let's find out what this is all about we're facing this year both darkness and light how true is it boy more true today than ever the world is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in amen how many believe that this was in 63 how much more does that apply to today the most chaotic of all times since the andeluvian destruction just before the flood people are i don't know what to call them they think that god you know they don't even believe i guess they got flooded the place right so they perhaps don't think he'll destroy this place but he did destroy the world and he will destroy it again [Applause] and all the people in it every last one of them yeah he will he's going to do it you know so read first peter 3 heavens and earth will pass away all the elements shall melt with fervent heat behold the day cometh i think it is in uh malachi 4. behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the pride and all that do wickedly shall be ashes under the soles of your feet all that do wickedly shall burn amen you know when we talk about light and darkness we're talking about a spiritual light right now how many know that every one of us was born in darkness why because we were born in sin shaped iniquity come into this world speaking lies so i just want to make a statement this morning it takes the new birth to bring you into life if you aren't born again remember this you are still in darkness amen praise the lord you're still in darkness we want to address a little bit with the hell of the lord also some of the works of darkness some of its powers and what it does amen the power of darkness and the power of life paul said he says in chapter 13 of romans romans 13 and verse 8 it says oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this thou shalt not die not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not before witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any commandment it is briefly comprehended in this same namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as myself love working no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law that and that knowing the time that now it is high time to wake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than what we believe the night is far spent the day is at home let us therefore cast off the works of darkness how many believe that's what it's time to do as a preacher i want to say this that i truly believe that it is fine-tuning time for god's people fine-tuning time i wonder how many hands would go up if i asked this morning how many in here feel the holy spirit on a daily basis condemning you for the little things that you do wrong because remember light pushes darkness out jesus was light and it says in him with no darkness at all when we leave here we don't want to have any darkness in us at all there is a power of darkness and there is a power of light a strength when you think about power you think about strength or authority huh now we know that god hates a powerless church he hates a powerless religion and as i get younger and i hate weakness myself huh how many loves weakness feebleness it's no fun is it no none of us likes to all be just so you know we don't even like to feel bad do we we like to feel good we like to feel strong we like strength we like power the same way with god god loves a people that has some power in the old testament god through isaiah talked about he says your solemn feasts they're a stench in my nose because it's become just common to you you're doing the right thing you're doing according to the word but you don't have any sincerity anymore you don't have any feeling with it anymore therefore he says he says i won't accept you i don't even accept it and i will turn my face from your prayers if you're in a lukewarm condition like that god don't even hear your prayers when you're weak and sickly and offer god weakness is that all right [Applause] god loves a powerful church he loves a powerful people why because he is powerful he is power how many believes we've been delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the marvelous light amen oh my let me just read another quote would that be all right i believe it was in well my computer could given me the title i wish it would give me the title of the message so anyway it's an old spot six year old not a laptop but a countertop computer desktop that there you go desktop computer and and somehow or other this smart guy right here pushed some wrong buttons right around and he just doesn't give you the titles anymore you got to watch what mustard is what what buttons you fish but anyway um i'm not sure which one it was but anyway but the man says this way he says do you realize that there is really only two powers in the universe how many believe that all the different nations and all the difference between everybody amen and now i just want to say between the kingdoms and so forth all of these rest of these minor little things are connected either with either one of those powers can we say this morning let's not just address it to the nations and to the worlds and and just about putin and all that that's going on right there it's probably just a little jealousy or a greed or something like that is what caused that war huh one more oil one more money one decided the other one they already got a 200 million dollar yacht yet they're not happy it just goes to show you i don't care how rich you get you're still not content huh but not so much to look at those things as as to look at yourself every little thing that goes on in your life is either connected to a power of god power of light or it's the power of darkness now the power of darkness it is the power to drag you down because it's the power ultimately of death that's why in revelation he that wrote upon that horse it says that on his name his name that wrote on that horse going forth to conquering and to conquer his name was death so the power of darkness is the power of death it's the power of sorrow destruction depression huh that's what the power of darkness does it'll depress you amen and as brother danny said wednesday you know you know there's an aura that we have about each other and there's people that you love be around and other people that you don't want to be around why because there's a certain atmosphere that they have there's a power in the atmosphere that you have paul says don't we have power to lead about a brother or sister or a wife don't we have a power to have our own influence to have an aura about us an atmosphere about us you know i just love to get around somebody that's all down in the dumps don't you no we don't like to get around somebody that's down in the dumps and all sad and blue huh oh my see this is like light gives you that grin and his smile darkness oh i'm so depressed i just feel like shooting myself huh that's where darkness will get you it'll turn your smile upside down the devil will turn your smile upside down and every day you're in a battle between light and darkness [Music] my we're going to learn how to fight the darkness i mean how many knows you got to fight this darkness this darkness is overwhelming this our world is darker than ever before the people and their minds are darker than ever before they're in gross darkness when the man don't know if he's a man or woman can't know if she's a woman let me tell you something you are in gross darkness huh me and my wife is sitting on the couch talking about this morning she gets irritated she says what in the world let's just take all the homosexuals and put them on our island and take all the lesbians and put them on our island and they'll become extinct because i don't care how much a man thinks he's going to have a baby he ain't got the facilities for it he ain't got no whoo he can't make a baby huh gonna become extinct i got one word for the whole thing stupid that's what it is that that is really stupid that is that is beyond i'm sorry that's a compliment i don't know what word it's really really far out there what does the bible say about brother i know that's your opinion but what does the bible say about it the bible says that people homosexuals see they have been given over to reprobate mind in other words they're not even in their right mind anymore you have lost your mind is what the bible says you have been given the word to a rapper about night to do things it's not even seemly and calmly ah i'm gonna have protesters all up in here after a while do you know that the left now those abortionists because of this ruling they're going there today they're going to hit the churches with protests mother said we're going to protest motherhood protesting motherhood can you imagine all i can call them is a bunch of murdering hitler's murdering children is what they are they're hitler's children they're a bunch of murderers huh i told my wife i'd like to ask them this question when they come up and protest look that little heartbeat that you got you left think that just because it's in the womb that it's not a soul it's not a baby god says you know before you were formed in my your mother's womb i knew you god knows every one of them huh and that little heartbeat that knows the beating it's still beating it's still beating you you're saying back then it was all right to kill what if i turned left and decided hey you know what i don't think you're a human being either because that heartbeat maybe maybe you should be killed because that's what they're doing get a bunch of murderers well now you know where i stand on abortion forward at all amen and that mind isn't right either i'm sorry i'm sorry but to those who think abortion is right ain't right they're mind they are not right in their mind the world's not right that's why it's gross darkness folks oh my if it was wrong 100 years ago it's still wrong huh and just when you think it can't get any worse you got to look twice if you're going into a bathroom to see what kind of a sign is up there huh that's something ain't it that's pretty bad why it's because of the blindness of their minds while i'm thinking about let me just say this one of the worst kinds of darkness is deception people that think they're christians but their lives don't match up to it amen deceive remember the devil deceived them they think they're in light but yet they're not that's the worst kind of darkness amen the bible says in first john 1 and 6 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie in that right danny we lie they're liars you say well i got i know god no if you walk in darkness you don't have fellowship with him because he don't have fellowship with darkness bible says that light has no fellowship with darkness no come on now and do not the truth if we walk in the light as he is in the light amen think about this now this is the difference between a brother and a non-brother if we were in the light if two brothers walk in the light and see we will have fellowship one with another how many believes that if you and i are both seeking the truth and seeking more of god we're going to have fellowship but if there's somebody with the wrong motive or objective we're not going to have fellowship huh and the blood of jesus christ is god's son cleanses us from all unrighteousness amen before i begin with talking a little bit about what darkness is what light is let me just finish this quote after he said talking about we're facing this year both darkness and light the world is one of the most chaotic times of darkness it's ever stood in and yet it's standing again in the most blessed light that has ever shined i believe i'm standing in the most blessed light that has ever shined and if you and the light that god has sent for this day amen let me just explain what this light is i ain't going to get into it too much but we know that we went through what they called the dark ages huh when catholicism the catholics yes that's right the pope of rome and his church are responsible for the murder of 68 million christians through the dark ages they'll never shed that off of their back let me say this he is the antichrist on his crown it says vicarius felide which means instead of the son of god and in roman numerals if you'll add all those neuroma roman numerals up it comes to 666. and it's the number of a man huh he was responsible for dark ages do you realize in the dark ages that they would take christian literature and all that and they would burn all those books they didn't want the people to be smart they wanted in darkness huh anybody that didn't bow down to what they said and even bow down to the crucifix because they had that as an idol and the christians knew that that's what their theirs that crucifix was for them was an idol and they wouldn't do it i only bow to jesus christ not what you make me to bow down to and they would die by the millions you and i will never be able to comprehend in our mind the suffering the torture and the horribleness that our brothers and sisters experienced during those ages you can read martyr's mirror you can look at all those things you know and it is gory just to talk about pregnant mothers having their babies ripped out and fed to pigs and things like that just very it was very very bad all in the name of christianity tell me now i understand why it's called the dark ages how many knows we're going back really really fast into dark ages i am seeing more and more that what we call the left and conservativism is christianity people hate christians huh they're going to the supreme court the justices to protest now they're coming to your church to protest what's next how many of those it'll get worse why because they used to didn't care you said they just smoked their joints and be in happy happy land but not anymore all of a sudden everybody woke up let me tell you something they woke up because the devil got on them they're full of devils and they want to oh boy even to talking about any votes for trump you know he's in a cult you know things like that when it's your privilege to be able to vote for who you want to huh but it's demons that's really risen up and it's going to get chaotic how many knows it's going to be dark ages again after a while really really really bad but said they'll close places like this down you don't have to feed them anymore and we're almost at the place where we're fixing to see somebody outside huh coming at us coming after they want to come after us the devil wants to come after us amen i believe the prophet said you know the devil is powerless the power he doesn't hardly have any power unless he's got somebody to work through how many knows and the devil he's got somebody to work through but so does god he knows god has somebody to work through to so you look at these dark ages and you look at the minds of how everybody was and you compare that today amen and you look at even our politicians who wish their adversaries dead and if they die good riddance huh that's where their mind is that's how dark it's getting amen now let's go into the meaning of darkness and first of all let me say this that darkness came in in the garden of eden that's where darkness come in under the serpent right the serpent that beguiled eve and she had a son named cain right and the attribute of this young man was that he become jealous now he knows jealousy is an attribute of darkness huh if somebody messed around with your wife or your wife mess around with somebody you become jealous very jealous isn't that right and if you didn't care if he wasn't careful and if you didn't have the holy ghost that jealousy would become hatred you'd hate that person and you'd hate your your companion he's hater and if you let that eat at you just like he was with cain he let that eat at him and eat at him until he hated his brother because god showed him favor he wanted to get rid of him all together huh and it was so powerful the power of darkness was so powerful that it caused cain to get an attitude that he could take a rock or whatever and hit abel right over the head and smash him and i don't know how many times how many knows when people kill each other they don't just hit him once and twice they'll stab him a hundred times fifty times just keep on stabbing and stabbing his having a stab or hitting and hitting it that's the power of darkness folks how many knows you don't want no part of that no you don't want no part of jealousy huh you don't want no part of uh envy you don't want no part of hatred huh because it's darkness and it has to do with unbelief hello there's only two powers once the power of light wants the power of darkness on the contrast let me look at one for just a minute and the other part is on the part of light now how many knows that god is light god is light and the bible says his first john i believe it was and his life was the light of men am i right his life was the light of men now jesus says i am the light of the world another place that you are the light of the world how many knows you can't be the light of the world unless you have his life you can't have light in here unless you have god's life in here that's why it takes more than just the repentance at the altar and having your sins forgetting forgiven it takes a feeling of the holy spirit to empower you but as many believe saint john 12 and about 9 or 10 it says but as many believed him to them gave him the power to become sons and daughters of god notice he gives you power how many knows that he gives you power for a reason amen that power is to overcome because guess what let me ask you a question i know you'll get this quick in every church age that he wrote of in chapter 3 of revelations 1-3 he says to him that overcometh will grant i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i overcame the only kind that that god is going to have with him is those who have the power to overcome the strength to overcome something on the inside that causes you gives you the strength to overcome it's like worship man you could have it ritualistic or you could have it coming from your heart that's what god wants god wants you to be sincere he wants you to mean it he wants you to have power in there that's the only thing he accepts power to overcome the devil the power to overcome all evil praise the lord the power to turn your frown into a smile to give you joy i believe it was how many knows there's power and joy when you're happy you're a different person your outlook is different everything about you and david said the joy of the lord is my strength we should be so happy we can't hardly stand ourself we should have joy unspeakable and full of glory folks if your life ain't like that you aren't where you are to be in christ amen praise the god praise be to the lord amen you love him to think about it the power of light now just for a minute on the other hand we have hatred or jealousy power darkness i should back up just a minute can i the power of darkness is brought upon a person because they're disobedient to god disobedient to the word isn't that what cain was first he was disobedient he would not do like his brother said like god told him to do disobedient then all kinds of other things come in if you want to open yourself up to all the devils of hell just don't do what god says do can i just show you a little revelation lord give me this last week this last week the lord showed me that every little thing that you do that's contrary to the word is a curse to you as a christian god is going to correct you every little thing hey and that's down to your thoughts right down to your thoughts be careful what you think because everything about what you are is what you take in you take in and you become what you take in amen you must always think the right thoughts have a positive testimony that right that's not always easy to do but you always want to do it no matter what state you find yourself in okay so we have the power of disobedience brought envy against his brother brought hatred and ultimately murder death that's where darkness takes you how many knows we've been delivered from the power of darkness we've been delivered from hatred we don't hate anybody i mean you gotta love everybody it makes me love everybody on the opposite doctor this people they consist me i just hate everybody i hate everybody i'm gonna go shoot them all that's what they try to do am i right they get up in these high rises and shoot as many they just hate the world they hate everybody works of darkness where would you be folks if you would have been translated pull out of darkness into this light we'll walk in the light such a beautiful light folks i don't wanna i don't wanna live depressed you don't wanna live depressed you don't wanna live in the blues it's a horrible way to live amen me and my wife are talking and she says you know i'm not a negative person you know and i says i'm thankful you're not can you imagine having to live with somebody that's always negative and complaining and murdering it would be a terrible way to spend your old age a grouchy old man or a grouchy old woman huh what a terrible place to live something would have to give amen folks i would try to exercise what the prophet did very very much when his wife was all depressed and crying and the kids were screaming and she was small mind can't take it anymore she couldn't take it anymore are you with me and the problem of god says i can't live with this i can't do this i'm going to change the atmosphere and he got his apron on got over there and helped her with the dishes and talked about a pretty dress that he saw downtown maybe we could go get it in no time the kids were playing better they were getting along his wife was cheered up come on folks don't just beat him down for it pick him up you be the atmosphere you create that atmosphere isn't that right create your world everybody lives in the world of darkness or you live in the world of light there's only two factions you're living there this morning and even as a christian if you're still you know because there's just too many let me just say this there's just too many miserable christians and i just happen to understand and believe that they're not the kind of christians that they ought to be if they're still miserable there's still something really wrong huh amen we don't want to be miserable christians that's not how god intended for us to be god loves for his people have fullness of joy amen they have peace in their heart the other side for a minute the number one thing is of course we know that god is light right and also the bible says that god is love he is love that's what god is how many believes that in first john 2 and verse 9 it says he that saith that he is in the light and hateth his brother huh is in darkness even until now so you've got hate in your heart remember that's not god that's darkness in there huh now the next verse says two verses and he says he that loveth his brother abideth in light and there is not occasion of stumbling in him but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that darkness has blinded his eyes let's talk about that for just a minute in revelations 3 and verse 17 this church age and remember that god is dressed addressing and brother brother danny mentioned this wednesday god is addressing the church now not the world but this church his church that's supposed to be his church and it was the laodicea church age which was the last church age this is where we're in and they say that they're rich and increased with goods don't need nothing don't know that thou art wretched and miserable poor and blind get that blind and make it amen he that hated his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth so somebody that's blind tell me something can they is there any light if you want to you can close your eyes for just a minute i don't know i don't know about you but if you're not looking now you can open but for me i'd like to feel the edge now you can get up and walk around a little bit but when i ain't got my eyes up the bible talks about let the blind lead the blind and they'll stumble and fall into the ditch am i right in other words they don't know where they are in darkness the church world folks is in darkness i believe it was in 63 and the pope went to visit jerusalem and in that time frame there was an eclipse where the sun went completely out when he went over there but abram said it was significant because in this age according to him he says this is the age that goes completely black i was reading but brother says you know anymore you can't barely find christian churches he says you'll just find a little group here or a little group there once in a while you'll find a church that's on fire for god that's real genuine church you don't hardly find it anymore because this is the age of complete apostasy or complete blackout and if you'll see here i think in the original the spirit told him to just leave a little sliver of light in that last one but if you'll notice he says it goes completely dark just like the sunday the type of this is the when the holy spirit will be lifted then it'll be no light at all it'll be complete darkness back to my thought the other thing that god is and light is first of all is he's love love your brother huh how can you say that you love god if you can't love your brother love your fellow humans amen so love is of god he the bible says he that loveth is of god and he that loveth not is not of god because god is love now what does love there's that's one power that's the most powerful force two of the most brothers everything in god is most powerful because even prayer can be the most powerful huh faith can be the most powerful love can be the most powerful force there is in the world it's power how many knows oh my you let somebody start smacking your kids around daddy might send back hey but mama she'll be all over that person don't you dare touch my scratch before you 18 nobody come unleashed like a mother hen somebody's messing around with every little baby huh you ain't got to tell her you ain't got to say honey you ought to protect your child better huh no there's a power that comes up inside called the power of motherhood folks i'm telling you it's so powerful oh my and if you love god folks that's why we come to church and do what we do because we love god not because we have to not because somebody it's just something in us like that woman remember that ran into that fire was all disfigured the firemen wouldn't even go in anymore told her to stay out she ran right through the blaze and got her baby and come covered with a blanket and her face got all melted and deformed and looked hideous and terrible huh but all she cared about with that hanging skin and whatever it was she opened that's my baby that's much ah that's real motherhood you know there's another black woman that they seen go up on the bridge and cast her baby off the bridge he says that's not a mother she might have had a child but she's not a mother motherhood is something much deeper than that something that cares for that baby amen my the power of motherhood the power of love that's why the number one thing the church ought to have is love one for another how many believes that we're gonna have fervent love one for another amen and love what another thing is about light is love brings forgiveness i mean i said god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he gave forgave the whole world that whosoever should believe in him should not perish he pardoned and wrote the pardon of the whole world like i said the other sunday it's like he made a mistake and said whosoever will he could have said and mine elect or whom i have chosen huh but he said whosoever will he wants cain to come he wanted judas to be saved god is not willing to man he should perish the bible says huh he's not but he knows who's he is who he isn't he knows who will and who won't doesn't take away from his foreknowledge and his predestination and so forth but he put it out there for everybody amen how does saint john first john not first john but saint john 3 says something about he loved the world he says and he was the light of the world but men love darkness rather than light you know that's the problem is people love darkness rather than light people would hope not rather hold a grudge against somebody as to forgive them for it huh did a whole lot rather walk around with bitterness and a long face because i'll tell you what the bible says if you hold one sin against one person neither will your heavenly father forgive you of your trespasses if you do not forgive every man whose trespasses against you you walk around with bitterness you walk around with holding something and god don't even forgive you and you're going to continue to hold that bitterness because you just won't let go and you just won't surrender huh you won't surrender to god now here's a thought the bible paul said you know no man lives to himself and no man dies to himself he says you're going to serve somebody how many knows you are going to surrender to some one of those powers you're going to give yourself to one of those powers you're gonna be controlled by one of those powers either sadness and despair depression hatred bitterness oh my let me just say to this to this everybody in this world folks if you don't take the side of light and forgiveness there is so much human fallibility that you're going to be all kinds of bitter we as human beings are so fallible so full of mistakes we stick our foot in our mouth so many times we say things that's hurtful we do things that's not good and then when we don't do something somebody gets upset you're bound to lose one way or the other you're bound to make a mistake you're bound to do things wrong amen why do you think pastors don't fellowship with nobody they go out that door and go to their car and i'll see you next time i come up here to preach i ain't playing volley volleyball with you i'm doing this so they say away why because if they're their self you're going to see their fault you're going to see where they're human beings i know preachers i know famous preachers hello i've dealt with them i know they're false and i ain't even going to hear me hear and tell you about it because it would carry your mind but i'm here to tell you i don't care if it's donny reagan i don't care if it's in him they're human beings they're fallible they're not perfect and you find out how your pastor is when you get around him and so forth and do things and if you can't deal with that fallibility if you can't deal with that fault huh then you go say well brother bile is this way brother vows that way why do you think we want to go hide huh but yet we don't do we no i play volleyball with you i go hunting with you i do whatever you know because i'm not going to go hide i don't believe in hiding i like to fellowship with my sheep amen i'd like to get so close to you until i smell like it why'd you say that well brother bob says his shepherd lives and sleeps with his sheep until he gets a smell i'm like i'm almost uh that's right i choose not to go that route people want to be critical and and so forth and be that way that's on you not me amen is that okay yeah that's right fellowship one with another love one another realize we make mistakes i'll tell you this when i see your how many knows why do i not get off of this for a minute is this all right because i'll tell you this right now when i see your fault yeah i don't come up here just jump on your fault or no i realize that person needs prayer huh and i need prayer i sure ain't gonna hold nothing again no but we're all a little different and every one of us has a little bit of a fault in a different way we're different we are different huh some people might not like how boisterous or loud somebody is the other one while they're so quiet i wish they weren't so quiet and i wish that one wasn't so noisy hey if that's how they are embrace them say i like you just the way you are praise god because you know what one thing i've learned in my 60 years that takes god to change a person and a lot of people are the way they are because god made them that way that's the second part sure they can change if it's not for the good or whatever but to win their character i don't care what it is their character every person god made them that way and if god made you that way a lot of times you can't get away from it you're going to be that way how many agrees that you know people but they just don't seem to change that's just how they are well why don't you just accept that now i don't say about sin and bad but their character in the way that they are is something that you have to learn to accept and say well god made that person that way amen amen folks you don't know how many times i've asked myself god why didn't you make me perfect i'm not a perfect why did you make me perfect why didn't you make me this way huh i've had it that many times then i read brother brad i read where brother branham said that god will make a pastor a certain way for that group of people i say well lord i guess this is how you want me to be you know hard-headed stubborn huh yeah when it comes to the word i won't deviate no no not for nobody i won't i don't care if you give a thousand dollars a week in tithing i'm not going to let off of your toes all right i don't care and and you try to pressure me not to be the pastor because you don't think i ought to be and you're going to go about in mean ways to try to get me not to be oh no you're talking to the wrong person here huh no sparks are going to fly i'm not going anywhere unless god tells me to or you vote me out that's the only way huh because as long as i feel like god wants me here not all of hell is going to move it huh amen and when i see if it would be deceptive or wrong or mean then i realized that's not god you don't have to listen to that brother butler huh anyway that's just free i hope that helped but just the difference in character amen but to love one another despite the way they would how many i know you will after today we say lord help me to understand that that's just how that person is god has made him that way and it'll be god that has to change him a little bit because he's working on all of us isn't he and he's trying to perfect his character in each and every one of us amen hope i'm not going up too fast up there is she getting a little out of it there you go god bless you amen you love the lord all right we're gonna go short today maybe a little bit that okay now let's let's talk about how that we can have and possess god's power god's power oh my i love god's power how many love god's power let's give him a hand say thank you jesus for your power thank you for your power lord i want that power but the man says today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming power is returning good for evil huh didn't even jesus say to those murderers pharisees he said forgive them father for they don't know what to do how many knows when you've got light in here forgiveness the power of forgiveness it's powerful amen the power like jesus says in matthew to go the extra mile the power to turn the other cheek the power to speak good of those that speak evil of you see darkness oh my let me get down into church a little bit a little more pastoring is that okay people think gossip gossip backbiting that's all darkness that's all of darkness huh sulfuric acid but forgiveness long-suffering gentleness patience how many needs more patience more patience returning good for evil that's real power when you can love your enemy economy i mean you can't do that if you're not born again you can't do that without the holy ghost no you can't do it do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's god's power to return takes a real man to return evil for good how many believe that that's what light does it stops the darkness it's the opposite of darkness where they hate we love where they want to kill you we forgive because they trespass against you just like you do them only you forgive and that right you forgive get it under the blood then brother bam says you know people want power and they don't really know what power is or is i would put it how to get power what goes with it and i call this the power of surrender the power of surrender isn't that right when a man surrenders himself to the devil it'll take five six cops to finally tackle him down if then legion had so many demon powers on him they couldn't even keep him with chains maybe we'll see a video someday of him breaking those chains this is what he used to do break chains they couldn't refrain him he wasn't in jail he was in the tombs huh people were scared you talk about scared they took the other road they weren't going down that road legion lane no no legion lane for me let the guy come out there and beat you over the head huh demon power right because he had what surrendered himself amen young people you get to be the age of 14 to 18. that's a dangerous time you know because you're at the age to where it's hard to spank your children at 14 and 15. it would come a time when i would quit beating my boys you just can't beat him as an adult you know it's not not the right thing to do but that's when you'll either fall in line hell isn't that right and if you do rebel you go against god then you begin to get spirits it can start with a simple thing like a lie then you'll make that lie right huh next time you cheat you do this after the other you do things behind mom and daddy's back they shouldn't do all the time demons coming in hello after a while i'm gonna run away from home huh that's a real strong demon yeah that's where he wants you to get out there you know how many parents have lost their children to uh drugs out there on the streets and so far because they overdosed and everything else go out there and go further and further and further until they're perhaps dead amen demons because they have surrendered themselves they have given themselves they have allowed themselves and it takes humility i mean it takes the power of humility to say yes mom i was wrong i'm sorry huh maybe they don't want to fess up to it just confess it just humble yourself young people confess your false one to another because that's the only way to clear it up humble yourself and that's the way we got to do to god unless we humble ourselves to god and say god you are right you'll never get anywhere as a christian or any of the power of god until you admit that god's word is the truth god is right amen so now notice talking about what really brings the power he says the way up is down huh paul remember he had a weakness he was weak he had a high vision wrong or something was and so forth and yet god said i have to take this away for because when you are weak paul says when i am weak then he is strong you got to be weak and this is my closing statement is let's be weak in our self so that he can be strong in us and that's what we truly believe on the way to church i said lord get thomas byler completely out of the picture i don't want him nowhere around how many with me i don't want myself anywhere around i want nothing but christ projected because that's the only way that people will see the light of god the light of the world in you everybody in here i know you may be going to sleep and think but listen let me ask you this question are you the light of the world you should be because jesus says you are the light of the world that kind deed that you need amen the bible says it lets your light so shine before men that they may see your good works that's how they tell is by the things that you do is what shows the light amen how many has ever been a light to somebody by throwing a tantrum tan tempered hammer no right it don't work but when you keep your calm they say how did you keep your calm and all that you know i was so mean to you and here you're nice to me that's not easy to die it takes the holy ghost and it is the true light our life is light amen if you want power see how humble you can get amen praise the lord buddy i'm going to tell you something if thomas pilots ever gets up here and thinks boy he can preach you can believe the next service is going to be horrible brother brad or that service is going to be poor power anytime you think that you can do something and you don't say i'm going to realize hey you are absolutely nothing remember stay that way by the rams just stay down there huh see how humble you can get get away from your whole world you think humble yourself before god he says then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a great bunch of noise because why because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ i mean that's the greatest battle that any of us will ever have is completely surrendering and committing ourselves to god because your flesh does not want to commit your commit to god didn't want to come to church this morning i hope everybody was all ready but maybe some of us this morning was just at a place i don't know if i want to go huh and you have to conquer that thing i want to go fishing i want to go do this i want to go do that huh prayer in the morning read your bible amen try to be a witness to somebody else no the biggest enemy you'll ever fight it's not the devil amen because jesus whipped him at calvary jesus conquered everything for us at calvary all we have to do is completely surrender because let me say this you will commit yourself you will surrender yourself to one or the other paul says no man lives or dies to himself you can't serve yourself you're either going to serve the devil or god one of the other you have to make a choice so how much better is it for us to commit ourselves to god the holy spirit to humbles ourselves before him he says that's real power that's real power when you can completely commit yourself surrender yourself to god because he'll feel you how many knows he'll fill you with that holy ghost he'll keep you amen you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogant just sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has favor and the power of god in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god and letting god work through us not making not about making a lot of noise amen hey man i used to ride in a wagon going down the road and i'll tell you every lap every loose sport in that wagon every little noise when you know a bump it rattled and it carried on but when it was full of food for our cows and our horses on our way back it was just quiet you hear little little squeaking of the springs and this out of the other and the clacking of the horse's hoofs huh praise the lord you hear a little amen say praise god you hear a little squeak i like to hear a little squeak sometimes now let's not get too quiet amen but when you're full how many just once i just want to be full of the power of god burn burn holy spirit burn in me set my soul on fire fill me with the holy ghost make me like the saints of old and then healing and raising the dead amen burn holy spirit burn in me i don't know about you but that's my heart's desires for more of the holy spirit power and i don't know about you but i long to see more of the power of god working among us amen i believe the power of prayer maybe believes in the power of prayer don't never think prayer don't work jesus had to pray pray always daniel prayed god hears prayer he loves you for to communicate with him amen it brings god on the scene it stops the mouths of lions amen have a real fellowship with god the power of prayer amen you love the lord this morning stand with me we'll close with hum humbling ourselves bowing our heads and let's just have a word of prayer i hope somewhere and something was said perhaps about darkness and what it is somebody in here perhaps says but well i've still got some darkness in my life and i want it all gone i want all every bit of darkness out of my life this morning if you want to raise your hands lord i still have a little and i want it gone lord jesus i surrender myself to you lord i'm still not quite what i should be lord and i pray god as we raise our hands together each and every one of us raise our hands and say lord jesus we want your power but god we realize to get that we have to surrender to you every aspect of our life our hearts our minds our soul and our strength surrendered to you lord so that you can use this for your kingdom lord so that we can be a light to our neighbors to the world and those around us lord to show them a little kindness show them love lord jesus show forgiveness show them the grace that you have shown us lord and we ask god that you draw us all closer to you lord and fill us with more of your power father and just help us lord each day each day as that holy spirit works in our lives and as you show father in our hearts and lives in little places lord still not quite what they ought to be lord jesus and that fine tuning we ask god that you do that work lord jesus with each one father lord just talk to him lord just speak to each one father continue to lead and guide us lord to a closer walk with you in one of these days lord we realize that according to your word we're going to go from this dimension to the other we're going to see you coming in the clouds of glory lord and as it said in the book of acts as you have seen him go so he shall return they watched him go and i believe that your saints are going to watch him come back lord and soul we will gather with all the saints of all the ages to be with the light of the world jesus christ throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity lord and over there we realize the sun will be gone because there'll be no night there the bible says and the lamb is the light thereof will live in that light continuously never be around darkness never be any negative lord jesus never be any hatred or malice it'll be perfect love in a perfect world of life life lord lord in this springtime we see the flowers in full bloom how beautiful they are and how they we wish that there was flowers that they could just stay in that full bloom all the time lord we realize over there they will all the greens will the trees will be green forever
