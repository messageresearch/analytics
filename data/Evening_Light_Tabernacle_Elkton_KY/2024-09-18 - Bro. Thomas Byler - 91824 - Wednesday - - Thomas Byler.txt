get together on the Square Saturday night everybody's invited to come that once too amen so be praying praying that the Lord will have his way amen looking forward to what the Lord will do amen let's bow our heads our precious and wonderful Lord and Savior as we come before you tonight Bob we want to thank you Lord for the Grand opportunity of being able to assemble ourselves together with your children people of like Faith Lord just to gather together to open up father the only thing that is proven and that is an absolute Lord Jesus that we know that is not a lie but it's the truth father and we thank you Lord for that what a privilege people we are father and we just want to praise you Lord Jesus even as we sang in the hymns Lord Jesus that you are worthy of Praise Lord and when you thought of this whole program before the world was ever even created you knew down at the end of it all that there would be people that you would have sons and daughters you would have children that would bring praise and glory and that would sing to your name and of your greatness and of how wonderful a God that you are Lord because of how great you truly are and what you've done in our lives how you've chained us how you've changed us how you've brought us out of the deep myy clay Lord and Lord the place of sinking sand that we were in Lord Jesus father and no hope father without God just without any kind of anchor in our life and then you come along Lord and give us that anchor and showed us who we are and what we are what we're here for where we come from and in a million billion years from now where we'll be and we're so grateful for that how it does our hearts and souls good to know that God you we you are our father and we are in your care Lord we ask God you'll just bless the meditation of our heart father that which we feel you've laid upon a heart to minister grant us Lord Jesus the anointing father that we need keep us from saying anything that we shouldn't and to say just what you would want us to say bless your word and the reading of it now in Jesus name amen turn your bibles if you will to Matthew 24 Matthew 24 32 24 and 32 now learn the parable of the Fig Tree when its branch is yet tender and putteth forth his leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily at say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away amen and it's something I that uh he he he really wouldn't have to say that because he wouldn't have but he wants you to understand that his words won't pass away amen so he said it he says look one thing you can count on is that my words will not pass away amen I'm glad for that but if that day and the hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of no were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark knew not until the flood came and took shall it also be at the of the son of man the two shall be two then two shall be in the field be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the Mill the one shall be taken and the other therefore for you know not the day for the hour that your lord doth come but know this that if the Goodman of the house would have known in what watched it he the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord made ruler over his household to give meat give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but if if that servant shall say in his heart my de Lord my Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow serpent Ser servants and to eat and to drink with the drunk and the Lord of that servant shall come in a day that he lookth not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him aunder and appoint his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping in nashing of teeth amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen trying to try to amen just to be able to come through here with some of the thoughts amen of uh of this scripture and U I think we all know that brother bandam he makes the statement that Jesus actually talked more about his second coming than he did amen about his first amen he talked a lot about his second coming amen in this scripture here amen as we want to try to amen just look at this for a minute with the help of the lord we realize that uh the we're living in a late hour ain't that right we're living in the fulfilling of this scripture and I've I've touched on this and I've ministered on this quite a few times but I feel led to do it amen just one more time amen and and trying to just look at it because I believe this is our scripture this is is our scripture amen amen because it is talking about the second coming of the Lord amen and tonight I titled it verse 42 watch therefore for you know not what the hour that it comes he says and I just titled it tonight watch watch amen so how many believes we need to watch we need to be watching amen and there's another scripture I want to read in uh chapter 16 of Matthew Matthew 16 Matthew 16 amen says the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came tempting and tempting Desiring him that he would show them a sign from heaven and he answered and said unto them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it shall be foul weather for the sky is red and lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot Des discern the signs of the times amen amen so we see here he says even Jesus was talking because we realize that how many knows that the scribes and the Pharisees and the religious people of that hour they actually missed Christ amen they missed him for the most part because he came in a simple way in a way that they did not expect him to come amen but they should have seen whenever the sign of the Messiah was being done they should have realized hey this must be that Messiah is that right this must be the sign of the Messiah and because that they they they they missed the day of their visitation or they missed what God was doing in front of them amen Jesus ended up being on the mount amen and and weeping and talking about how that they had missed their hour and how that he would have hovered them as a h as a brood but they would not isn't that right and we're living in and it's quite something when you think about America and America that we live in and all of the Baptist and Methodist and the Presbyterian the Pentecostals and and everybody all the religious people that we had in all the Bible school had to teach that that we got taught am mean in the word to understand how God works still we all know that this generation also missed him it's a terrible thing to miss what God's doing in front of you how many knows that amen really appreciate the atmosphere here tonight amen and and the songs s and everybody just really in it I really appreciate that amen so we're just going to amen see where the Lord will take us tonight but we want to we want to talk about that watching for a little bit because I believe that we're living in an hour uh that we should be on our toes we have to watch we have to be careful amen because uh I believe that even and I'm going to talk a little bit about politics and so forth but I guess you know coming up the next 50 days or so I don't know just how long it is to election day but it's going to be Monumental for a message believer ain't that right amen because we believe that we may be looking at the fulfilling of Prophecy is't that right and I mean the prophets been off the scene for so long now over I don't know 50 some odd years and yall remember when he had the those Visions back in 33 of musolini and Hitler and Germany and all these different lines and all these different things that take place right and then he had like seven Visions is that right seven different visions that he had and so uh and I want to go into that with the help of the Lord because I believe it's important that we see the day and it's very exciting because uh let me let me just read you a quote now that brings us then to the election of President Kennedy and this car coming am me I think it was the car one of the cars that they was going to make that was going to be aerodynamic and and it was going to be self-driven we know that we've got they've got that already is that right they've already got that and then after that he talks about a woman coming into power and then after that it was going to be the destruction the destruction that comes so now listen to what he says I like what he says and this car coming on the scene bringing five things out of seven that has happened exactly so that leaves us with what two things two things to happen and that is he says and I predicted now this is a lot of lot of his prediction in one one place there's one place that he did say thus sayeth the Lord that would be a woman a woman rule either a vice president or a president is that right and I saw a great woman standing up beautiful dressed in a real highly Royal like purple and we know that when uh uh uh camela whenever she was in the inauguration that she wore that purple and it caught our eyes our eyes popped open here's a woman you know I mean Hillary was before that Hillary was a chance of that woman coming into power but she lost and you know I don't want to be mean so I won't say something but anyway uh she didn't fit it right she didn't really fit the prophecy but this would be a whole lot closer to fit in the prophecy especially with the dressing of the purple and so forth is't that right and really when you think about it I mean you know uh the vi being a vice president amen look she she could have already feel fulfilled that in that part but the fact that a woman and camela and we everybody looks at her Record Man it is nothing to brag about I don't care what what she did was nothing to brag about I guess whenever she went tried to run for president I think about a year or so ago she got like 1% or maybe 1% she you know this ain't going to work right so and and then all of a sudden here she is and she's get thrown right up here into the front page of everything and and becomes uh you know right now the race is about 5050 it's a it's a tied race all of a sudden where Trump was way ahead of Biden but it brings it all down there and and then our eyes pop open again and that right we're like whoa wait a minute look at this amen and so with this is the thing I want to bring out with just two more things and I I will say three but um I'll bring that out in a minute because we know that uh our loved ones are to appear and so forth isn't that right there's supposed to be a Rapture because uh really let me just say this for you and I there's only one more thing to happen before the rapture right only one more thing for you and I cuz I sure don't want to be here for the second one right right that's got to be tribulation period right Annihilation destruction oh my that right so can I read you a few things first of all let me just go back a little bit because we're living in a we're living in a exciting hour this is an exciting time things are starting to get exciting you know what's you know uh when the word when we hear the word we hear prophecy and we hear it and understand it's going to happen but when those things be begin to materialize in front of you then it's a whole different story ain't that right it's a whole lot more exciting it's more exciting whenever you ask God and pray for pray to God about something and and and the thing that you prayed for all of a sudden there it materializes woo you got something to shout about then and that's the way it is with prophecy when we see it happening hey we've got to be it's got It's close night we're almost there now Jesus told us he says you better be watching isn't that right when you see the Fig Tree putting forth its bud when you see the other buds putting forth their buds is that right as it was in the days of lot and as it was in the days of Noah and we've seen all of those things we've seen the Sodom and Gomorrah condition already we've seen Sodom come into fruition and so forth and all that we've seen all these other prophecies but this has got us our attention and I've got several different scenarios amen I've got wrote down here about four different scenarios that we're looking at and we'll go over them with the help of the Lord but I want to read you cck quotes first listen brother bam says listen we're standing tonight upon the brim watching come to pass and unfold two great scenes one of those scenes are these one of them is the ending of History amen the ending of history and the ending of time amen many great men down Through the Ages has longed to see this hour that you're we are now approaching amen how many know Luther Wesley Paul all of those great men they long to see the hour Amen to believe in the hours they they were under expect expectation God Amen he's fixing to come the second second time I mean know there's not one thing there's not one hope left in this world outside of the coming of the Lord that's the only hope there is the only hope there is is the coming of the Lord now wouldn't you wouldn't it be scary if you wasn't one of God's children boy God's going to come back and I'm not ready and there ain't nothing else there is no other hope that's right but when you're a Christian when you're ready to go and you're prayed up then it's a different story praise be to God oh my are you ready for this I've got wrote down here if we know if we know that when she comes into Power the things that she's going to do I'll read some of them you know am me how what she'll do and dominate and be a dominate you know the country and the rule just do what she wants to pretty much you know and ruin the country and then we realize that after that woman comes into it we realize he said the next thing he saw was the complete annihilation of the world we realize if that's a fact and if that's the way it is then guess what you better be looking for your loved ones to appear it's Rapture time between that woman and the next it's Rapture time it's coming real close praise be to God and I got wrote down here man if we know if we know that that's going to usher in and it's going to bring us right close to that time of the Rapture why shouldn't we be hoping well praise the Lord let it come even so let it happen anden I got wrote down here it might get me thrown out here people might not like it well but maybe we ought to go vote for her let's get this thing over with Let's Get It On that's what they going to happen whether you vote or not or whatever it don't matter if get Sky if it's prophecy it's going to happen I think one of the greatest thing is that that you can be under expectation and you can be enthused and you can be inspired and happy about it you don't have to be scared about it I don't have to be scared about it why because we know that the very Lord that we've been serving amen all of time all of history all of the Saints of all the ages have been looking for this moment for this time they want the coming back of the Lord they want to meet him they want to see the one that has been in their hearts and in their lives we want to be with him amen we want to be with him we want to be there and that time is Justified upon us we're happy about that not sad it's not a sad thing it's a joyous thing it's it's an exciting thing oh maybe they'll shut us down we already know that there's one of her agendas is to Amen to to persecute Christians I can show you a quote where brother B says when that woman when all of that happens he said there come a persecution upon the people God's people and it'll drive them together he says it that's what it'll take to bring message people together that persecution you'll lay aside your little isms and whether he's on a white cloud or a horse you worry about all of your little difference it ain't going to make nothing to the real believer anymore to me it don't make no difference anyway amen but we let little isms come between us some time amen praise be to God but oh I like that oh as we live in this glorious setting of mortal sun and breaking of Eternal Light amen listen he says we're living in one of the grandest ages that ever man was permitted to live and we sit there really I don't see nothing so Grand about it what's so Grand about it what's so Grand about [Laughter] it let me let me I hope I can hold my thought you see we see this age that we're living in it's one of the greatest grandest ages of all ages the leosia age is the grandest of all the church ises because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity didn't blood bab say just the head just ahead lays the most horriblest time for an unbeliever but for the believer it's the greatest time I don't know about you but when something the greatest of all time it all to do a little something for us the greatest of all the times is what you're living in it's what I'm living in it's the grandest of all of them yeah it's something to stomp about great time we're going to get to see Jesus face to face I me's looking forward to seeing Jesus face to face he's going to come it's time for that stone to come and to crush these nations and let him rule let him Reign How many say let him rule let him reain there'll be an eternal reign with him it won't go$ 35 trillion dollar into debt that's right how many knows that's how far in debt we are amen praise the Lord you see we're kind of looking because the the prediction and the prophecy is that she'll ruin the nation well maybe she already did H 35 million is a pretty much a ruination as far as I'm concerned a trillion a year just to pay the interest yeah oh let's go pray let's go pay for reparations right these states are paying people to uh you know because they're great great great great great great great great grandfather was a slave amen I won't go there but anyway I like like one of them said he says it's paid paid to people never were slaves being paid by people that never had slaves amen my what kind of sense people have lost people have lost their minds the world has oh boy butam said the world will go insane I am here to change that I'm here to say it not will it has arrived this world has gone insane this world is insane it's an insane institution we might act a little bit crazy we might act a little bit insane but but that's because we're happy amen because the only ones that we we're the only ones that are say thank you Jesus for having given me a clear mind amen giving peace to my mind knowing where I come from knowing what I am thank you Lord for letting me know that I am a man you sisters thank you Lord for letting me know that I am a woman that's right we have a clear understanding aren't you thankful for that I wanted to make this a 45 minute one but I don't know if we will tonight oh my the grandest ages of all time amen and listen to this it's the ending of time the blending of Eternity and it's the greatest it's the greatest sinful age there's more sin in this age than there has ever been and the powers of satans are many times harder to fight against than it was in any age amen just everywhere traps are set everywhere her Ain that right every kind of sin every kind of pleasure amen that that you could possibly have but what I wanted to tell you a while ago that I wanted to remember amen that is amen we're happy because the powers of God in this end time before we go but I feel it already don't you the power of God being released all of Heaven I mean all of hell has let loose but all of Heaven has leted loose and where is he going and into the hearts of those who are going to have a body change it better be changing you it better be changing me from glory to glory it's changing me his likeness and image perfecting me it's a grand age Grand praise be to God okay well you can't go home on a holler you needs some word right praise be to God five things so we seen the woman rise up listen and she was a lying woman probably God said lying she was vulgar as she was and dominated the country listen and I predict that a woman will either be president or be in some great power some sort of United States before the total annihilation of the world I hadn't really noticed that before I know he predicted and said that in EN Vision he saw America but he talks about the annihilation of the world how many knows you got to be careful with these things because we know we're going to be annihilated but the big question is did we get any off sister Becky did we get any of the missiles off the ground did we annihilate those who annihilated us don't know isn't it something that Trump said that if she gets in we're in danger of World War II how many knows that a lot of people have had to say yeah Trump was right he said that and it was right yeah there's a lot of things he said that ended up being right and Caleb you said you saw Putin right threatening NATO and America with nuclear Annihilation not just in the last few days coming out of his own mouth now you tell me we're not in Tribulation pre-tribulation real close people are getting the attitude even coming out with their mouth saying I me we really want to blow you up it's what he's saying because he hates us and he hates NATO ain't that right that's right but how many knows he's going to blow us up didn't brother B Russ got got one for Fifth Street or somewhere in Louisville he got a name on got our name on it Russia's gonna blow us up guess who else he goingon to blow up he's going to vot to blow the Vatican up Russia GNA blow a lot of people up brother Bram said that's what God raised him up for why do you think Russia survived even though they collapsed they're still there cuz there has to be prophecy that is fulfilled ain't that right they may have a sorry Army that's right you can't even defeat the country that don't have an army Ukraine is't that right I I don't know about you but I don't think you had much of an army all of these little ways that they could take care of them so forth still fighting them but they do have some nukes folk they've got nukes and I'm talking enough to take the whole world out and so do we and see it's not just about if they destroy America America has enough Subs out there in the waters to destroy several times over just in the subs that they have so you see where he says the whole world annihilated amen there's going to be a fire oh my we can only imagine didn't they didn't they hesitate when they set off the atom bomb at the first time they hesitate it to do it fa fearing that they would set off the atoms in the air and the whole world would burn over now how do you know the whole world ain't going to catch fire if you set this thing off huh oh my when you think about that kind of fire now notice he says keep that in mind right now notice talking about a Mar's a a woman's Nations a great woman will rise up and be president or something like that in the nation and then there will come a total Annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out so that was the seven visions that he said after that woman comes into Power then there's Annihilation and that's why ours are open boy this woman in purple and and and and and Timothy puit I watched some of this on him and he had a picture of one of the newspapers where brother brandom said she's like a queen or something amen and it showed they one of the newspapers they they love her so much they put a crown on her like some queen or something amen I mean notice that kind of catches our attention queen crown coming into Power amen now I want to talk to you about the scenario if she doesn't get elected at all but of course personally I'll give you my opinion I I think she'll get in amen kind of hope she does actually if it's the fulfilling of the scriptures then I say let it happen because I don't care what I don't I don't care if Trump gets back under this world brother bam says it's going going to get worse and worse till the skies catch on fire the only reason we want Trump is because there might be a little more time might be a little reprieve but I want I want to I want to check you on that too here in a minute if I can and don't forget to amen right now notice something like that in the nation and then there will come totally and that entire nation will be wiped out now Noti and he says so I didn't know just then when I when I saw that that that it's they had something that could annihilate it but they got it now I see the nation in total Annihilation just stumps and trees and things like that so it's on its Road and if these other things has come to pass just as he said that never that will also how many know it's going to happen if Christ came the first time he'll come the second time W I'm glad for that if he said he'll come back he's coming back and all the things he said will come to pass and duly seeing this and knowing that our number is just about to be called as a nation knowing that the church is about to take its Rapture it moves the heart of a minister or any of the Ley to know that we're in this that we're in this day and time that we're living in it's the greatest time that any person person ever lived on the earth amen praise the Lord what an exciting Time Eternity right ahead of us a body change right ahead of us heaven right ahead of us no more death no more sickness this little thing that you got in there to call the Holy Ghost called eternal life it's going to become what you could never imagine how many knows we can't imagine what lays ahead for us even brother bam says if you die and go over there to the other side he had no words to explain to you how wonderful it is just thee wo how many believes we're in the moment amen we're in that time praise the Lord praise be to God the time is at hand Jesus said watch you know the signs of the time if you know what hour watch the signs around us I believe we're all watching and mean we got our eyes open look at the signs around us for 50 some years maybe we were sluggish maybe we were not sure of things but this is one true one good sign amen that we're looking at praise the Lord all right one was listen now listen and now these women helped elect the wrong person then I seen a woman great gr woman rise up in the United States well-dressed and beautiful cruel in heart amen and she will either guide or lead this nation to ruination amen talks about science and its progress and the mechanic and Automobiles and all of that now I'm not going to go into that too much we've seen that a brother even brother abam says that's already happened then I see the United States as a smoldering burned over place it will be near the end now how many remembers in uh in uh Nebuchadnezzar in div Vision that he had of that stature of gold and the head of gold and and the chest and all down he talks about the kingdoms that are come all the way down to the uh Toes that were iron and Clay amen and brother bam says that we were down in those toes now all the way at the bottom now and kusf meant iron I mean me meant clay and Eisenhower or Eisenhower meant iron amen and they couldn't get along how manyan know for some reason folks we just can't get along with Russia Trump kind of he he kind of halfway gets along with Putin and so forth and claims he can actually stop that war with a phone call if he gets elected before he ever takes office the man's got a lot of confidence and with who he is I'm I'm just going to give it to him maybe he can I shouldn't doubt him even though I do a little but let me tell you something how many knows the Democrats don't want to be friends with Putin they don't want to be friends with Russia no they don't want to be no friends with them at all that's right but they don't we just don't get along we've been basically declared enemies we're pretty much enemies but anyway they don't mix and listen to what there's listen they couldn't mix together he took his shoe off and beat it see there's no mixing together they can't mix they won't cleave the Bible says one to another they just won't cleave one to another do you see friends the next thing that's left is for the stone to be cut out the coming of the Lord to roll into this image and to smash it into pieces oh my and all these kingdoms will be ground and blow away we blow it away all right fire stumps burn that is everywhere how many know the Bible says that amen the day cometh that shall burn us in heaven all the pride and all that do wickedly shall be ashes under your feate how many knows that's something else that you can look forward to coming back and walk on the ashes of the wicked no matter how they treated you no matter how low you was and how everything else they lied about you on that day you'll walk on their ashes amen they'll be blowned away he says this stone is going to come and blow him away amen these kingdoms will be ground and blowed away like the chaff on the summing thresher floor we're at the end time brother sister can't you see where we're at amen listen thus sayith the Lord I predicted the three curtains in the name of the Lord the Iron Curtain Russia red China bamboo curtain they're horrible but watch that purple curtain that's rising in the United States and over the world that Roman Empire the crest of them all just today I seen the flick on uh see Flick where the pope was am me meeting and he's making a trip around the world different places and he's talking about he says you know everybody wants God and he says you know he's we're all his children he said we're all his children come to me a that right come to me and I thought you know he's a false prophet you expect him to lie not everybody on Earth is God's children read your Bible there's the tears Jesus said the tears are the children of the wicked one amen but that's just how he does Amen but think about it he says even in America the crest of all of them remember in the name of the Lord get away from it come away from it from anything that's attached to it flee to the Rock the coming of the Lord is at hand we need a conference amen have a talk listen now notice as we see the days darkening and we see the Shadows falling when I predicted just a few more turns of the Sun and this nation's gone hasn't even been 200 years he says and no democracy has ever lasted 200 years and I'm not sure which one it was Eisenhower or one of them that we were in a war and they said they should never take a third term and then I think they did and he said that broke the Democracy right there didn't even last 200 years before those seven years up were up I can get you a quote brother bam said the were broken before then and I manyan those my goodness gracious you talk about breaking our democracy amen nowadays have no respect for it whatsoever is that right the Supreme Court ruled that Biden and all them can't forgive student Le loans and stuff they kept right on doing it don't matter what the Supreme Court says amen isn't that sad listen we see the condition of the time we see the condition of the people we see the condition of politics we see the condition of the world it can't stand it's got to sink like the Titanic it must go down to give our one nation gives room to another and this Kingdom Must Fall in every Kingdom Amen to give room to that Kingdom that's coming which can not fall how many knows that we are Americans as far as our our uh bloodline and so forth we're Americans we're of this Kingdom of America but down on the inside we're of another kingdom a kingdom can never pass away never come to that it don't matter what king it don't matter what dictator tries to get us to leave that Kingdom people would rather die and give their lives by the millions than to try to denounce this Kingdom that you and I are in how many knows these kingdoms has to fall amen praise be to God Amen so let me uh it's going good let me just say a few things here as we talk about this election that's coming up how exciting it is and we think well guess what if Trump gets it well it'll seem like a little reprieve but if she gets to be the actual ruler of it all then I guess we'll every one of us will be definitely heads up heads up folks start looking for your loved ones and see if you're not ready you better get ready how many times did I read that even Jesus said be ready for you know not the day watch and be ready watch and be ready that was one of the main things that Jesus said in these Parables am mean even in 20 the fourth 25th chapter when he talked to wise foolish and the uh foolish virgins and the wise virgins went out there one had oil one didn't have oil amen I think if I can just get it real quick and I want to um read that and of course we know the foolish virgin said to the wise virgin give us of your oil they said no you go buy and sell you know and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards also came the other virgin saying Lord open to us and he answered verily I said I know you not watch therefore for you neither know the day nor the hour when the Lord son of man cometh watch therefore for you know not now there was a scripture I wanted to go to in Thessalonians I didn't have this tag but I remember somewhere here um in 2 Thessalonians 5 I believe it was here here he's saying watch because you don't neither the day nor the hour where in the son of man cometh but now we know by the signs of the time how many knows we're very getting very close getting very close to the coming of the Lord amen and I'm just going to put this in because we know brother Brandon whenever he talked about this woman whenever he talked about the annihilation he says and I predict that all this will happen before 77 look where we are now you tell me we're not ripe tell me we're not ready why do you think all believers have their eyes open right now Wella these things has to happen sooner or later amen when we see we when you see these things happen look up quit looking around amen make sure your priorities right like brother Joe's prayer make sure Lord that we have our priorities right all all this stuff in the earth it ain't going to mean nothing keep God on the Forefront why do you think I want to keep preaching you know that we've got to walk Enoch's walk if there's if there's one desire that I have as a pastor here and that is that every one of you walk Enoch's walk every day it don't matter if Trump in or anybody or what come you walk that every day amen watch for you not the day but uh Paul said it this way but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others amen but let us watch and be sober for that for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunk in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the bless breast pain of faith and of love and the forign helmet the hope of Salvation so Paul's saying you know it's not going to take you as a thief and over in in Matthew even Jesus says you know that servant that is watching for his coming and waiting for his coming I like these two words those that are leaving are going to be doing two things they're going to be watching and they're going to be ready be ye therefore ready they're watching and they're ready amen I don't know what it does to some people Tommy but it could I guess if you wasn't right with God scare you to think that we were that close that a woman is right there and the next thing's Annihilation but I truly believe if you're right with God it ought to excite you amen it ought to it ought to do something for you say Thank you Lord Jesus I'm so close to home now that's why Paul died that's why Peter died that's why all of them died and give their lives because they wanted to spend heaven with Jesus Christ they wanted to see his second coming they want to be in the resurrection they want eternal life and they've been waiting for all of these thousands of years for this moment and here we are getting close to it amen all right now how many knows that when you talk when you talk about the signs of the times when you talk about you know watching for the things that happen even brother brandham said one place he says you know there come an hour when people would say well I thought that there was supposed to be a Rapture first so what I'm saying is it's easy to miss the signs around us it's easy to miss number two whether it's me whether it's any other preacher or all of us when it comes to these things we think a little different Amen brother I I'll just put this out there brother Phil kind of leans on that it'll be the conservatives that bring in that persecution well I don't really see it that way because I'm watching who's really bringing it in but it's fine you know because we do realize that he set the world counil of churches and so forth but oh brother brand I read a quote today where he says brother bandam said that they already joined into Catholicism into Dem Market ofes into world ccil and they didn't even know it that's what brother bam said about the church they already in it and didn't realize it when they go shake hands they kiss it Pentecostals and Baptist when you go and you fall down before the pope and you you become one with him guess you're already in folks because you who knows who's going to rule that's going to be the pope it's going to be Catholicism that ultimately rules the calling these prop and that it's all part part of that so if you can find out what Catholicism is pushing and so forth then you'll know who's behind it but just exactly how it is you got to keep a comma behind what you believe and a lot of us see a little different that's why we just watch watch it transform let's let's see how it comes apart how it happens but my warning to you tonight is amen and that is that what if Trump gets it well this was all just a well this is nothing turn not the way we thought it did is that what we're going to say don't say that don't say that why because she has in a way already fulfilled that scripture she's already done it she already was in she was he said a president or vice president that's what he said she was already that vice president and what has they what have they done to our country with the economy and with the flooding of immigrants and the disrespect to the law and being a dictator woo this could get you in trouble but how many those they have been nothing but dictators up there don't matter what nobody does and they want to even quize our nuclear system so be careful it may be brother bam never said that it'd be the last president that that woman would be the last president maybe she's fulfilling that let's keep keep her eyes open be Lord don't let me miss it if she don't get it maybe that was it and the next thing is that we look for our loved ones because the fire's going to fall you never know who's going to throw that bomb amen just you have to be careful sometimes it's more simple than what we think we expect for her to come and totally destroy it well they destroyed it they borrowed millions and trillions into that through us into into total chaos isn't that right amen so that was my second scenario amen one is that uh she gets it and hey it'll look even more like the fulfilling of it and we'll see what happens from there on the other scenario Trump gets it and amen and and then we just got to be careful amen because you don't know just you know it could have been fulfilled already because she certainly did a lot of it but at any rate the most important thing is you and me check your heart I've got a few more quotes I want to get into amen and it's out of it almost seems like I'm taking a detour but this is about you and I being ready okay let's focus on that for just a little bit brother pranon preached a message you should listen to it straight is the gate straight is the gate amen listen he says now he says it's better take inventory this morning Christian he says there'll be tens times Millions times billions of CR Christians staunched in their life that'll miss the gate Jesus said so straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it he says as it was in the days of Noah what was it seven seven nine SA night and then in the days of lot three few there be that find it listen to this how many's going in I don't know I don't know how many's going only God knows let me be one of them that's right he's a judge let me be the one you say brother bam how can you tell that you're a Christian amen he says I don't know but let me tell you what the scripture says surely you'll believe that and he talks about amen where the Bible says you know uh the Bible says go and put a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the Abominations that's done in the city in other words they're tore up about the sins that's committed in the world Amen so that's one say one way that you know that you're on the right path amen oh I can show you plenty going to church I can show you plenty singing the choir I can show you plenty teaching Sunday school I can show you plenty that's in uh the great societies and and that shouts and speaks in tongues plenty that works the gospel but let show me a man that's down on his heart troubled over the sins of the world show me a preacher that can stand today and condemn those denominations show my preacher that'll stand and condemn them things he better not he'll be kicked out that's his Meal Ticket amen listen as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man he says oh the tens of thousands there was there were out of tens of thousands there were three saved you'd say to me preacher what about all of those thousands that's going uh to come up with him no brother that's made up of many generations two times brother brandom talked in that message if I remember right of what he thought and I said I hope what brother brandham thinks and the way that he thought it I hope he's wrong you don't hear preacher say that too often I hope he's wrong for the statement that he's about to make I'll be surprised if it doesn't come out of this generation I'll be surprised if it doesn't come out straight is the gate narrow is the way and few there'll be that find it oh I know the churches what they say if you put your name on the book and become a member you're all right there's no such scripture as that if everything that's got its name on the book in the church there'll be millions and billions times billions everything will go and all kinds of spirits will be in there then what kind of condition will Heaven be amen oh my let me warn you this morning church be careful take time today in our we take time in our self-righteous self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy that we're living in an hour when men and women stand in churches and in pews and sing anthems of God walk out of the church smoke cigarettes drink whiskey go to dances live like the world tell dirty smutty jokes call themselves Christians men and women who walk from the pulpit and from church and from the place of the power of the Resurrection where the sign the same Messiah sign is a moving among them and not be a new creature in Christ there's something wrong how many knows that God used brother bam he used the him to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart but he was in Africa just one sign and 30,000 would come to the altar come to America and he doesn't they say well I guess that's a pretty good service how many knows when God came and he did that Messiah sign it was the last sign before Sodom burn but Abram said when the come Prophet comes on the scene look out judgment's on its way we won't go into the justice of God and so forth but let me just let me go on here moving new creature there's something wrong when papers can blast it from coast to coast back and forth from the Frozen regions of the North to the tropical jungles of the South God sends it people constantly turn their back on it then what can we say what can we do we turn on scriptures and say straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that will find it amen I'd like to liken that that generation to this day when we got millions joining churches we've got tens of thousands and God comes down to live in his church again to do the same things that he did to make himself the same yesterday today and forever and people turn their back from it constantly I mean that's what exactly what the church world did amen some to be popular some to keep from having to make a choice it's forced to the people you have to make a choice you've got to say yes or no you'll never leave that door the same person that you came in you can't do it you've got a choice to make make it for Christ this morning amen amen praise the Lord then he says now someone would say to me now wait a minute Matthew 17 Matthew 7 see the scripture says many will come to me in that day and say Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name did many wonderful works then I will profess to them I never knew you depart from me you workers of iniquity how many believe that this is the hour of soul searching every individual in here everybody you have to search your soul now I'm going to give you a couple quotes of brother bam and how we what we really want to be amen because how many I I okay this is what I thought about when he said I doubt a dozen are going I thought well guess what I guess it's down to 11 brother Tommy down 11 who wants to make it 10 oh that's the way I'm talking about that's right we got a bunch of said No 10 how about nine how about eight seven six better get hand up quick amen why because you got to believe that you are got one if it's just a dozen boy I'm telling you I got I got number 12 I may be the last but I I got I got a number here amen that's the way we've got to see it that's and that just in case you didn't understand that's where I hope brother bandam was wrong you know that he doubt it well I hope he's wrong about that I hope there's a whole lot more than that to go and he said he didn't know it was not any kind of a prophecy but looking at it because you got to look it Through The Eyes of the prophet he seen what people did with Jesus when he came and proved himself and how they ministers in the back Rose when he begin to say the same thing that Paul said you know I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and then he begin to tell of how he was you know packing water for his dad and a voice and there they go boy it's it's G to be it's G to be some kind of day judgment day it is going to be some kind of day they'll come to me and say oh we did this that or the other let me show you whenever I sent Malachi 4 to you I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and you walked out on him right there you did it and you said this bad about it and this bad I never knew you be gone and that'll be to brother Bram said millions and billions I think I've actually got the quote where he says it that way my my there'll be tens of millions and billions of professed Christians staunched in their life that's going to miss it amen all right our work tomorrow our jobs we have to ask ourselves it's not all that important this right here that we're here tonight it's not important that we close at 8:30 right now is that right what's important is that we've got everybody with their hearts lined up with God have your heart lined up with God so that you can say like Enoch the Bible says that he had this testimony that he pleased God I'll never have to tell you sisters not to wear makeup I'll never have to tell you not to cut your hair I'll never have to tell you not to wear pants or two tightest skirts I'll never have to do any of that if you are living a life to where you're wanting to please God all those things will take care of themselves can I say a little bit more I'll never have to say well yeah I wish you would get to church more why do you miss church so much if you want to please God when them doors are open you'll try to be in there thank you Lord Jesus that's right yeah amen that's what we want we are not leaving out those doors the same as we came I don't know about you but that God has given us dresswear he has given us a word a perfect Vindicated word even brother bam says I'm dressing the bride how many believe that he's dressing the bride this message will dress you it will have you ready for a body ch it will it'll have me I said you it'll have me ready for a body change I'm here to tell you if camela gets it I'm going to be watching for my left ones and me if Trump gets it I'm going to be watching for my loved on I'm looking for a Rapture to happen at any time amen you better be ready for an hour well now we got the Bible and the reason I read that but if the servant says the Lord delayeth his coming trumps in now we can relax and you better watch out you better watch out maybe it was fulfilled amen and the next one is a Rapture the church when you don't think he's going to come that's when he'll come but the believer's got his eyes open and he's watching for every time Lord I know you do things in simple ways sometimes and people go right over the top of of it amen it was quite something brother Bram said all these things are supposed to happen yet the doors closed this out of the other and he said could all happen by morning we could be gone amen so be ready God bless you amen who are they that's going just a few will be saved just remember very few you be one of them let's all say I I am one of them I'm one of them amen because it's scary when he says stuff like only 12 amen who are they brother bam I don't know nobody else knows we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling but you be lined up with God if your heart don't beat just with that Bible then there's something wrong there's something wrong no matter what your church says you can't go by it you got to go by what God said this is the book that you're going to be judged by now the thing to do is from your heart be a chran lord I want to be a Christian in My Heart Lord I want to be a real Christian not a phony not a hypocrite I want be a real Christian how many bles if you've got the Holy Ghost you are a real Christian be a real Christian woo Glory that's what he says you want to be there you be a Christian enter in at the Straight Gate for broad is the way that leads to destruction and millions times millions in dis generations of Believers will go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way you just you and Christ Alone Now arrow is the way that leadth to life and just a few that'll be that find it that's the words of Our Lord I know you think I'm a hard guy I'm not hard I'm your brother and I love you you flee that wrath that is to come go to the cross and you cry until your heart is so filled with his spir spirit that you'll turn your back from everything of the world and you'll walk Godly before him with your heart burning for him love not a duty Christ is not a duty to serve Christ it's a love to serve him it strains you it's constrains you till every pulsation of your life beats for him every pulation every word every breath beats for Christ Glory there that's the kind of life you want to live amen oh Lord search me try my case right now don't let me have to come before judgment you after preaching this way brother Braham said don't let me have to come to your judgment after preaching this way oh if there be any unclean thing in me Lord take it away please we see the day that we're living in when men and women are becoming so starchy they're shamed can I add a little they can't say Amen they can't say praise the Lord they got no enthusiasm the things of the world are more important than God go Church you better watch yourself he said one time there's not even a blush among the Zionist those in Zion you know that God's time piece is y under beating away just a few more minutes or two even the world says it was three minutes way back then and I think it's a few seconds away now the great Destruction come then let him that's filthy be filthy still God wake us up this morning Shake us Lord we see signs appearing we got our eyes open now to know that we see Millions Lord that's turning their back and gone away amen I wonder oh Lord what can I do is there anything Lord if it takes more preaching if it takes more prayer more anything help me Lord that I might bring the message to the people amen go preach it on the housetop I thought about loud preaching how many know loud preaching Jesus said what you hear in ear get on top of a house amen and tell the world about it put my Pulpit up there on top brother Tommy we're going to get on top of that courthouse on the top of the roof scream repent El repent quickly God is here to forgive you of all of your sin no matter what it is but if you spurn God's mercy nothing left but judgment stand with me you love the Lord tonight amen I may

you why watch keep your eyes open and make sure that you're ready that means you've got everything taken care of all the sins are under the blood all sins are forgiven and you walk with him daily looking for him looking for loved ones as we know looking for that Resurrection to happen at any time God you see our hands that are up Lord we want to be right we want to be a Christian a real genuine Christian we ask God cleanse us tonight have us ready for whichever way things go we want to be ready to meet you Lord for we don't plan on being here for the destruction at all for you are getting us ready and for that we thank you in Jesus name amen what will it be in closing what will it be as I was thinking of the Resurrection one of these A's maybe sister Hannah maybe Sister Sarah

disappeared we must be close huh wouldn't it be something one of these days some of us see our loved ones appear then brother Braham says the resurrection is on it'll build our faith amen and that
