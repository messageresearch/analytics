sing that song periodically but do you realize what you're really asking for in the old testament you read when the power of god came down it was normally so great that they could even like on the mountain they couldn't even get on the mountain they would kill them or in the sanctuary it'd be so great that they couldn't and we're asking god to come in this yeah amen we have we're so blessed amen let's just stand and sing it of [Music] [Applause] course [Music] true [Music] be [Music] yes lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] my [Music] oh my what a cry what a plea to god [Music] i want to be something like that's never been on the earth before i want to be your sanctuary lord amen ain't been truly love being back here but i think i'm gonna have to slip up here on a sunday to hear brother tom preach so the only time i've got to hear you i believe is watching you and i'd rather be here so maybe next time we'll just surprise everybody and slide in on you but uh my brother tom asked me about brother girl and i got a text friday so and he's recovered from the virus and his strength is coming back but it's just really slow and uh they told him i think he was still on oxygen this week breathing going to rehab twice or three times a week but uh he is getting better praise god and you know whatever you want to call it the virus is real people's really getting sick and it affects people so much differently than others but you know brother carol's not a young man and it takes him a little while longer to recover so uh he truly appreciates your prayers but he is recovering they told him he needed patience and telling brother carol he needs patience like telling me i need patience it don't always go over good but uh we're believing god completely healing gaining all his strength back and uh seeing mount moving about again i've missed suppers with our dinners with him i try to meet him every now and then and eat with him and through all of this he wouldn't be smart so i'm ready for him to get better where i can go sit down and eat lunch with him again so but uh just continue to pray and pray for each and every one of us hey it's like what stephen said man we're out there rubbing elbows with the world we don't know what they got when we go into the gas station we don't know what bug they've got on them you better be frayed up you better have a sanctuary you better be believing god's going to take care of you so and i thank god that he's done that so scripture let's turn to exodus chapter three this morning i was spent yesterday evening trying to get my mind away and i've never preached this before so i'm not sure where it's going to go but we're going to try to go with it 1958 brother branham in a message i know my redeemer with liberty he says you know how that coincides this morning with the faith the living faith of a living god in his church he said there is something in our heart that speaks that there is a land beyond that river he says i cannot put my finger on that land and neither can any man but there's something within us that tells us that the grave is not its goal that even though as dust there are and dust that return us it was not spoken unto the soul there's something within us a fire that is burning a light that has been lit by god that no breeze can blow out there's no coat spells in the church there's no indifferences amongst the people there's no persecution of the world that can blow out that flame that god has lit praise god for god's purpose that he torched light of freedom would burn into the coming of the lord and no powers can blow it out there will only they will only make it burn brighter as they blow and it's been proven through the aging that persecution strengthens the church amen do we live in that today thank god for a prophet that could say it in such words that there's no code spells in the church there's no indifferences in our opinions there's no pressures and persecutions of the world that condemn this light that god has lit inside of me it's going to burn even brighter but in exodus just to do a foundation and try to title it this morning there is a land there is a land exodus chapter three just start a foundation chapter one we find moses now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law and the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to a mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame a fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses says i will not turn aside and see thy great sight why the bush is not burnt when the lord saw that he turned aside to sea god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses and he said here i am and he said drone nigh drove not neither hither put off thy shoes off thy feet for the place where thy standeth is holy ground wherever he says i am the god of the father the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob and moses hid his face and he was afraid to look upon god what a place to be welcoming to come live in us and the lord said i have surely seen the afflictions of my people which are in egypt and have heard thy cry by reason and i've heard by thy tax masters and i know thy sorrows and i come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land and bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large into a land flowing with milk and honey under the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amrits and pesticides and the havats and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is coming to me and i have also seen the oppression where the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh and that i mayest bring forth my people the children of israel the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go into pharaoh and that i should bring the children or bring forth the children from israel out of egypt and he said surely i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt you shall serve god under this mountain very unfamiliar but let's say what a prayer heavenly father lord you see this morning as we gather together lord we hear such wonderful testimonies of how prayer still changes things lord and lord we're in a season of time lord we're in the end of time here that we're in such a battle lord but we have a promise lord this isn't just for naught we're not fighting this batter for naught but we have a promise that there is a land to come it is truly a land that flows with milk and honey it is truly a land that represents every promise that you've given us lord and lord let that fire running inside of us burn ever so bright that lord we can believe and have faith that we're coming to that land lord be with us this morning lord lord move myself aside lord teach me lord to yield to the holy spirit lord we love you we thank you we give you the praise in your lovely name the lord jesus christ amen and you'll be seated and i thought as beautiful as beautiful as the scripture is to me and sometimes i often i go back and i just read the scripture that i think is so common that that we've all heard preached on we've all read the scripture and we know the story of how the burning bush was but lord there's so many more meanings inside of that if we can get in touch with god if we can find and as i was reading it this morning i began to see yes that bush yes we know we we know the the wording of the scripture that that bush burned with the flame of fire but never was consumed it was never consumed why because the bush was not burning it was the holy spirit inside of that bush and i began to think as my wife would sing that song oh god that's what we're asking of you it's to come down and live inside of burn that fire ever so brightly it ain't going to consume this flesh this flesh is still going to have thought this flesh is still going to happen but god on the inside of the inside would you burn me out to anything unlike you and anything in my mind and become who you are in my life and i began to think oh god that's what it's going to take to go to in this land you realize they had dreads and and as we could back top this story maybe a little we could find the children of israel had come accustomed to the time they lived in they had gotten used to getting up in the morning and going mixing the mortar and making the brick and to just being a slave but there was something on the inside that still wasn't satisfied and they begin to cry out to god god this isn't the way you want us to live and i thought oh god ain't that how we are as children of god we're living here but there's something on the inside that is crying out for a land to come that it's not happy living the way we're living that he's not happy going through daily life but yet there's something there saying oh god get us to that promised land but you know what in every situation god gives a promise he gives a way to get to that promise you realize that when god gave them the promise that there was a land of milk and honey he had already foresaw how joshua was going to take him into that land he had already saw how the people with mum were against god how they would murmur against moses but yet that didn't change the promise of god there was still a land to come and i think oh god thank god for that because we're living in a day that is a bride we mumble and complain more than we've ever mumbled and complained we gripe about everything we debate about everything but yet that doesn't change what god said was gonna happen he said there would be a bride she would be spotless she would be white as snow and she would go into a rapture that's like oh god and it's such a miracle that moses would turn aside and begin to speak to god in that bush and that god would begin to tell moses i have heard the cries of my people i have a land prepared for them i have a promised place prepared for them i'm going to send you moses to go get them you know god in our day he knew there would be a bride in 2020 that was putting up with corruption like they've never been on the face of the earth that's putting up with covet 19 that another world has never seen this kind of action he knew that we would be living here but he also knew there was a fire inside of that bride that was crying for a land to come so what did he do he sent a prophet in our day you realize he died in 65 but he was preaching to us in our day he was preaching to the bride he was preaching to the remnant that was looking for that land to come you know so many times we often forget the people that brother branham was preaching to in the 50s and 60s wasn't understanding what he was saying they wasn't grasping the revelation that was come but we come through the 70s we come through the 80s that was filled with revelation that revelation was just poured out upon the bride and we had scripture and we had a prophet that showed us it was true and we begin to believe it and that fire began to burn brighter every day in our lives what is it there's something on the inside of me that is longing for a land to come there's something inside of me that no matter what is happening around me i know where my destiny lays and i think and as great as this was to moses as great as this was to brother branham it wasn't for them to go into that land it wasn't for moses to go into the land the promise was in the moses to get my people out of egypt god never promised him the land he promised the people the land he promised the people of israel they had the land the sons and daughters of abraham the sons and daughters of isaac they are into them is the promise granted moses didn't make it but he didn't change god's promise you know i've been around the message all my life and i've heard people say well is that what brother brennan if what he taught if what he preached was absolutely the truth then why didn't he go in the rapture the rapture wasn't for him he was there to encourage the bride to let us know that the rapture is true the rapture is scripture the rapture is for our bride that is to come that doesn't discourage me when god sees fit to take his man he takes his man could you imagine though the people of israel i'm sure they got discouraged didn't they they're human they followed this man moses they saw his life do you realize moses had been taught from a child of the land that was to come moses had been taught that we're not egyptians we're israelites we're the gods people we have a promised land waiting for us we're in bondage here but one day god's gonna send someone for us he knew it in his mind but it never come real until he meet the fiery burning bush when he met the holy ghost himself he'd become real in his life oh that's the problem with so many people today they've never met god themselves they've said in message churches and they know baptize them in jesus name and they know the revelation that for horse riders and they know the seven seals and they know the thunders and they know all of it but they've never met a fiery burning bush before their us you know it changes you when you meet god face to face you can have all the knowledge in the world you can have you know we can relate this to the natural so many of you in here are so smart that you could astound me with your knowledge but you know what but you can go to school your whole life you can learn every degree you can you can have degrees up on top of degrees on top of degrees but if you never go into the workforce you really don't know what it's like you know we look in the natural okay and we find men this ain't in church this is just in the world we find people that come out of school and they go in to be you know i call them they their lifestyle becomes a properly graduate they're always in school but you know what they go to school for 20 years and maybe they go to school for business and they know every they know every objective they know every syllable they know everything there is to know about business but they never work a day in their life what good have they done and let me tell you something when they go into business they're going to fail because experience is a great teacher experience or teacher think that then books won't teach you when you make mistakes because that book tells you this is the way you ought to handle this but you don't take an account you're dealing with people oh god spiritually speaking that's the problem with the world today that's the problem with so many people in message churches today they know that there's a land but they don't have an experience of what that land is they don't have a situation that they can go back to that they can tie their anchor down to a table and say devil that's where i met god that's where my fire got lit that's where that fire that brother branham talked about that nothing can blow out that's where that fire got lit devil let me tell you something the harder you blow devil it's the more oxygen you give in that fire and that fire is just going to kill up me one day and i'm going to walk right out of here why because there's truth in the word of god how many of them come against moses as you let the children out we know the plagues we ain't got enough time to go all the way through this like it's a three-part sermon but we're just going to have to put it in there but we find that they would begin to go through all of these trials but nothing changed moses opinion moses could come before pharaoh and pharaoh could crack him down call him anything he wanted to tell him he wasn't taking a people and moses would walk out with his head held high so i'll be back tomorrow i'm taking my people out of here why because he had a promise from god that god was going to deliver them people and he knew by the experience with that burning bush that it wasn't just something that somebody put a thought in his head that somebody just told him what it was going to be like but it was something real inside of him that he knew he was the man oh god if the bride of christ could ever get to the point that they could realize they are the bride of christ i'm not talking about two interlect i'm not talking about because somebody told you you're the bride that i'm talking about on the inside of the inside if that fire can light inside of you and you could realize who you are nothing could stand before you no discouragement no disease no sickness no nothing could stand before you why because that fire that's burning inside of you makes you equal with god you say oh brother no i'm serious it makes you equal with god because gail you have made a sanctuary for god to come down inside of your life and for you to realize this isn't my dwelling place i have a land for me i believe i have a land for me deuteronomy 1 we find again another we skip some but we begin to speak unto the children it says behold i have set the land before you go in and possess it you realize every promise of god requires you to do something god ain't just gonna you know look look there's there's a bunch of snotty nosed brats that are running around this world because mom and daddy gives them everything sometimes i think my kids are the worst see i talk about me and i don't talk about y'all okay but there's a lot of brats running around this world that gets everything handed to him on a silver platter though that he's a great businessman he made all this money and they just give it to him and he runs it in the ground because he has no experience to back up what he's done dear god that's what's tried to happen inside of manchester churches oh my pastor so and so i don't care who your pastor is who is your god who is the one that is burning on the inside of you who is your where is your witness behold i have sent the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob and he gave to them so he'd already gained their land they just had to go get it look our land is already there he went to prepare a place he went to build a mansion for us he went to build the streets of gold for us it's up to us to go claim that land to give unto them and their seed after them and i speak unto you at this time saying i am not able to bury you myself alone that the lord your god has multiplied you and behold you are this day as the stars of heaven for the multitude and the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more than you are and bless you as he has promised you little bride he's promised you a rapture it's time for an encouragement inside the bride it's time for us to get our thoughts out of our head of how it can't happen and it can't happen and it ain't going to happen because then no it's going to happen the promise is unto the pride the promises of those that has that fire burning in sight of them in this day there is a promise that there is a land to carry there's a promise to come on down in jeromey one we know the scripture probably aware but i just feel to read it verse 21 says behold the lord thy god has set the land before thee go up and possess it little bride is time to quit playing church it's time to quit sitting on the pews and waiting on the pastor to bring the sermon it's time to quit sitting on the pews and wait on the song leader to get everybody in a good mood it's time to show up prayed up and ready for service it's time to show up with your arms up in the air saying thank god i'm not sick thank god i'm able to come to church thank god i'm here to praise the lord this morning i'm here to lift my hands i'm here to sing the psalms i'm here to say amen to your word [Music] amen he said and let the lamb before they go up and possess it and the lord god thy father has said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged yourself but you're reading old testament it is an example unto us it is an example unto a people that is in bondage in a land that does not have that promise that is waiting for the fulfillment of their promise but it is an example to you and uh that though we are aliens living in this world that we're living in a time that is so frustrated and discouraged and distressed we have a promise of a land that there is a land and it's true and you came near unto me every one of you and you said we will send men before us and they should search out all the land and bring this word again bring us word again what are they going to bring back they're going to bring back word they're going to bring back scripture they're going to bring back quotes from the prophet to show you that this is true a man gets up and he tries to discount the word of god he tries to discount the prophets that god has said you better get away from me you better get behind to get out of his sight why because he's not bringing you to a fulfillment of your promise he's trying to discourage you and get you to where you can't even receive a blessing but what do they do they're going to bring word into you and saying please me well and i took 12 of you one out of every tribe and they turned and they went into the mountain and they came into the valley vessel and they searched it out and they took out of the fruit of the land in their hands and they brought it down unto us and they brought us word again so everything they did they took them back to the word they took them back to hey this is the proof this is the evidence this is what i'm talking about you see you know what i proved to you it's the evidence we can go back in my life and show you the sinner that i am and then we can show you the man that i am today it didn't happen because i went to a self-help group it didn't happen because i wanted to be a good person it's happening because something was lit inside of my life and it began to change who i am why because that coincides with the word if it doesn't coincide with the word you need to get to an altar if you need a self-help book to get you to doing better you need to go to an altar because you're still trying to fight with the old human you're trying to try and fight with the old demon that's sitting inside of you but if you'll ever release it to him and let the holy ghost burn it out there'll be nothing that can keep you from that promised land they took the fruit of the land in their hands they brought it down to us and they brought us word again and said it is a good land and which our lord god does give us you realize even the lion spies couldn't lie about the word they had to agree the truth they had to agree the promise was true they had to sit and agree and tell the people look here's the grapes here's the apples here's all the fruit it all coincides with the word of god it all coincides with what moses said it would be the land is there it's truly there it's not a myth it's not a it's not a magical illusion that's trying to crap to your mind it is true the land is there little bride the truth is the land for us is there it's not just a story told by a man of god it's not just the story that your pastor preached is about but there is a land that is a true land of christ there is a promise to come oh i'm over here i'm going to skip down and read a quote and then we'll go back maybe in 1960 as i was with moses so i'll be with you but the brotherhood says joshua he knew that land was there why because joshua was one of those spies he saw it with his own eyes he said he knew that land was there and he went first and he found out that he could come back as a witness that that land was true brother when it says god called ministers ought not to be so stuffed out with theology but have visited the land to where we're going oh god brother brother come back in our day there's a bunch of message preachers he'd give a hide woman because we've become so theological we've become so that we can quote everything and we can understand everything but brother said don't give me god called me in like that but give me god called men that's been across that death river had been across and has seen that land to come and i can give you an example that land is real god called ministers oh not to be so stuffed out with theology but have visited the land that you which were going bringing back evidence of the divine love and the power of jesus christ to make known to their congregation that there is a land beyond that river help us in 2020 god to realize just because mama called or that he called a preacher don't mean he's got god just because a man can get up there and quote a few scripture and quote a few quotes that don't make him a preacher you're looking for a man of god that can stand up and say i've experienced the love of god i've experienced the grace of god i've experienced the creation of god i've been there done that i've been to the back side of the desert i've been before that pillar of fire it has burned inside of me now i'm one with that word and i can tell you by an example that god is ripple his promises are real you say you get excited yeah i get excited because i know where we're going oh and i can feel every day that words tell you a state thing closer that we're a step closer that that promise is fixed into in fulfillment you imagine it's just what we're skipping down here but we're going to go with it we could find him we can imagine joshua even though they listened to the lion's face even though they turned and walked away from jordan they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years i don't think joshua was discouraged today in his life joshua knew what was coming to him he had a promise of a land i wrote down this sitting in the office we find that joshua crossed into that line and though everything was taught against joshua everything alive was taught against joshua everything oh god help us this morning everything is light against the bride everything has told us that we're much a hypocrite there were a bunch of foolish people that were a bunch of fanatics that we've lost our minds thank god we've lost our minds and gained his mind we find joshua across that land and it changed who he was joshua was never the same person anymore why god let him cross death he'd let him cross the river jordan he'd let him cross over and see the promises are true he let him cross over and see it wasn't just a story but it's true this land really does exist no wonder we need ministers that have been across that land that have been to that promise and they can come back and tell you it's not just a story i'm not just trying to make you feel good i'm not just trying to beat you into submission i'm not just trying to control your life i'm here as a living example that that land to come is true in anointed land of god and the only way in is to get burned again and get a hole it goes fire burning inside of you you realize there's no way through all of the discernment through all the persecution through all the trials that a bride will go through there's no way without the holy ghost you can make it i don't care if it's your kid my kid your spouse my i don't care if they don't have the holy ghost they're not going to make it to this land they're not going to make it through this persecution they're going to fall by the wayside look sometimes we need to just open their eyes and don't be in this bubble thinking that everything around us is false there's on this message that we would have never thought would have left this message that we would have stood up and staked our reputation on the fact that this brother this sister they'll never leave and they've left the message why did they leave there wasn't something there that was holding them to the truth they was trying to do it on man's central leg they was trying to do it on man-made experiences and they had never met god you realize a man can come by a good evangelist hey a good evangelist i love a good evangelist because man he can come into the church and he can put a whooping on everybody in the church and i didn't care but you know what he can do he can stir up a fire inside of you he can smoke around he can he can trot around he can get you encouraged he can get you set up that you want to do what's right he can get you to an altar and there's nothing wrong with any of that but until you meet god that evangelist is just working on your emotions until you meet god and allow god to light that fire it won't last let's just be honest for a second okay how many youth chemists do we have every year and i love youth camps i take our youth group every year to any of them that i can i'm not against them don't even quote me of that but you know what there's hundreds of youth laying in the altar but a month from a month later where are they at they've worked up an emotion they've worked up an appetite they worked up and that's all good we need that but if they don't allow god to strike the match it would burn out and they would go back to who they was what is it they can't focus that the promise is true you realize you realize all the ones that come against the prophet and come against this message they don't come against their saith lord they don't come against the miracles of the healing because they can't come against it because it's true but what do they do they come against things that they don't see they come against oh it's the bridge and there's so many people fell in why because they can't see it and they don't have the faith of god just to believe the man for his word why there's nothing burning inside of them they come to church every sunday they've come to church every wednesday they've heard the preacher talk about brother brethem they believe yeah he was a special man look the the hottest believe jesus was a prophet but that don't make them right there's a lot of people the devil knows brother brennan was a prophet but that don't make him right just because you come to a message church and you believe that brother brennan was a prophet there's still not a fire lit inside of you you still can't go back and say that is my promised land that is what i have been given that is mine yeah i'm selfish it's mine and i'm going to that promised land and i'm going to take and i'm going to possess what god has given me i feel like caleb when caleb stood up and he says he promised me that mountain i'm gonna go take it i'm not worried about it i'm not i'm not stressed about it god if it's your time for me to take that mountain give me the word i'm going to take that mountain no wonder brother branham could say he said if god would tell me to go to the cemetery and raise george washington on the dead i'd invite him and use that like there was why because if god tells you to go get it it's going to happen there's a fire burning on the inside that isn't happy with our contemporary lifestyles that isn't happy with what we're living at that is a happy living and dealing with corroborating when it isn't happy with living with the politics the way here but he's crying out to god saying but god you promised unto my fathers and unto their fathers that there was a land to come it's time for me to experience that land we find joshua crossed into that land he saw for himself all the false reports wouldn't want to change his mind he done had an experience with god see so many of us mama had an experience and a false report changes her mind because we didn't have the experience but joshua had an experience josh was seeing that land with his own eyes joshua may have took a bite of that grief and realized that's the best grape he ever put in his mouth kind of some of us i put a good stake in my mouth i can't wait to get back to that store to get me another one and that's by the way joshua felt joshua said hey there's something there that's quenching my appetite there's something there that's satisfying the inside of the inside i can't wait to get back to where i'm going oh little pride if we could get a taste of that this morning if we could get a true feeling of what that land is there'll be something rises up inside of us he says i can't wait to get there why because there is a land it's not a myth it's not a story but it's a true anointed land of god that is bright that is going to all the false reports all the lies get your mind off of joshua for a minute and think about the bride in 2020 all of the false reports you ain't going to change the bride's opinion why because she knows there's a land all of the lies all of the insults oh god all the unbelief all the doubt all the people siding with the false flies it ain't gonna hurt me none if they want to side against me let them side against me because i ain't on the winning side why because i've met my fire and it rubbed off on me i become one with him and though i may not look like it sometime he's living on the inside of me and he's moving my every day and he's moving in my life every day and he's drawing me closer and he's letting me know i didn't just promise you that to make you feel better but i promise you that because i love you and i want you to have what i've given unto you i wonder how many people children of god how many children of israel that walked the millions upon the millions right that walked out of egypt under all the plaques that walked to the red sea saw god open it up and cross over the red sea as they wandered in the wilderness they had to think where did we miss it this isn't what we was promised there had to be times they began to cry out and say we've missed it but it never changed the promise there was still a people gonna go into that oh god help us this morning help us to see that oh god we may have failed we may have fumbled the ball we may have missed the step but you know what it's time to get back up on the horse it's time to get back up on the train and say god i'm in line with your word god i may have held you but you never failed me you've never felt me you realize in the day that we're living in whether brethren would going on and he would say we live under a joshua ministry why because it's a ministry that tops the holy spirit there may not be a prophet in the land but the holy spirit is in the land the holy ghost is in the land brother brown may not be walking in flesh amongst us but the god that directed that prophet to preach these messages is walking in flesh in you and i it's that fire that's burning inside of us it's the same god joshua stood there when it was time to cross that river and he knew moses wasn't with him he knew the prophet was gone but yet he had a promise that god had spoke to him as i was with moses i will be with you joshua had been in that land you realize moses never went land did he joshua did though and he knew that same god that had vindicated that prophet moses had now vindicated his life little children if we can open our eyes and see the same god that vindicated william branham is the same god that has vindicated each and every one of you why because you're his bride you're especially human as brother branham was you were special to him as paul was you are special to him as any man of god a daughter of god down through time has ever been why because you're his and he loved you so much that he placed a little lick of fire down inside of you kind of like they didn't know western days they took the branding iron and put it on the cattle hide be no mistake who he belongs to oh children of god when we walk into the world there shouldn't be no doubt who we belong to there shouldn't be no doubt that the world can look oh there's something different about brothers so and so there's something different about so and so they have a different brand in their life they have a different example in their life why because they realize they have a land they're going to this is not the land but that land is to come oh my 1965 things are to be brother brown says now think how that god how we should behave ourselves and act like christians if god's placed a lick of fire in you we'll act like he's placed a lick of fire in us we shouldn't just wander around with the world aimlessly and oh yeah i'll believe it one day no if he's placed a fire in you then we ought to be able to stand up and fight any battle that he places before us why because he has confidence in you he has the ability to believe you are going to overcome every test that he has why because he placed the litter on him in you we should behave ourselves and act like christians our conduct should be like christians oh but you don't know how they treated me that was free i'm sorry come on even as christians we get our own mind sometimes somebody does me wrong and i think well how can i get them back oh i guess i'm the only human in here come on we live there we deal with that don't tell me somebody comes by and sideswipes your brand new convertible you're going to just hug his neck and tell him you love him come on we should be like christians because we're aliens here this is not our home no we're just put here temporarily we've got to go every one of us tonight he said now think in god in his mercy as the mother before the little baby is born it's craving for some vitamin and the mother's word speaks for the dead i want a cantaloupe for a watermelon i want something another it's out of y he'll do everything he can to get that look we know that in the natural sense there's a pickles comfort and chocolate now that's that what a pregnant woman wrote i will do it it don't matter how stupid it sounds if our wife pregnant with our child wants something we're going to give it to him he says if so he says then why he'll do everything he can to get that because he knows he wants his child born as perfect as it can be see and he'll do everything that he's able to do to get it and brother brennan says how much more able or is he to get it he's the creator he now thank you now think how able he is to prepare as a body what to prepare us a body as a sanctuary before god how able is god to provide us with everything we have need of to prepare somebody to live in his own glorious body if we want to live there is something in us calls to life there's something in us that calls us to do right you ever realize when you truly get born again this flesh may want to go back to that honky tonk this flesh may want to turn that music on this flesh may want to hit that joint one more time but there's something on the inside that has a craving for something much higher there's something in us that calls us to do right then god will call somebody on the platform under the pulpit and we'll preach the absolute truth why see it shows you that if you're a real child of god you begin to cry out god take it away from me [Music] sucker-size me from this god i realize there's something in me that's craving for a new land but i also realize as a batter as paul says there's a battle within me between two the will to do right in the will to do wrong there's a life there there's a battle there but dear god i know which one i'm following i'm following the one that's going to get me to my promised land and i'm asking you this morning to circumcise anything unlike that promise out of my life see if you're a real child of god you'll do it if you're a true child of god you'll say amen to every word that it says even when it cuts your toes off you'll say amen i've had to do it before it's good for you it's good for you when preacher steps on your little pet peeve and you lift your hand and say hey man i don't know how i'm going to overcome it but amen that's the truth it gives you a little encouragement on the inside brennan told about the indian said which dog's winning he says the one that i feed the most dear god no wonder brother branham says you want to get closer to god read your bible and pray why because that end on the inside he needs fed he needs an anointing he needs to come to church and get in the atmosphere he needs to be preached too he needs to be taught to he needs to communicate with god he needs to strengthen himself to overcome the wiles of the devil somebody told me one time they've been going to message church for 40 years born again living for god everything's right well i'll just be honest with you wouldn't hurt me to miss a month church you liar i'm sorry i probably weren't supposed to tell you that because you're so well thought of by everybody in the message you miss church your life is going to show it you miss one service your life is going to show it why because you're not look at us you're our live stream thank god for live streaming conditions we need live stream but upstream isn't for a real child of god that is healthy and able to come to church that has the ability to get to a church but it isn't for that why because there's something in that child of god that desires in the presence of those that believe like him and worship thou almighty living god wow because they're not satisfied with where they're living they want to get closer to god well as i said wednesday night i tell my wife she's perfect she said no i'm still here it's truth and we're all still here so we ain't perfect well you know you know i mean it would be real i've often said i'm glad i didn't live in the 50s and 60s because i would have hated to be sitting on the front row and watch that prophet look at me and start discerning my life let's be honest but we can look and say everybody important fingers down but look let's see let's be honest i ain't always been the man i wanted to be i'm still not the man i want to be but there's something inside of me that is drawing me to that land that's drawing me to get as close to god as i can there's something in us that calls to do right then god would call somebody the platform of the pulpit and would preach the absolute truth why see it shows then that you're a real child of god and you begin to cry out god take this away but may circumcise me from this these things take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's going going to repair you've got to be a real word bride of christ you can't be lukewarm he's going to spew you out of his mouth god's going to be more upset at look more message believers than he is sinners on the streets he's going to be more disgusted and discouraged with people that have sit on message views their whole life and never give in to the glory of god then he is the drunk that's always been a drunk at least he knows who he is oh god help us matthew 5 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after vaginas for they shall be filled you know i told somebody one time i says if you ever lose that craving to get closer to god you better get away and pray you better get an ultra well but if you ever lose a burden to see us so saved something's wrong if you ever see a desire to see yourself and others get closer to god something's wrong when you start thinking in your mind well i've arrived if everybody else will get in their place we'll go home the devil's got you deceived ain't none of us arrived yet ain't none of us got to that place of our rapturing faith yet or we wouldn't be here this morning if we had rapturing faith we would walk out of here this morning but we're not there yet but there's something inside of us that knows that land that he's promised this is true that knows that rapture is true that knows that it's coming again between six and nine one morning that we're going to go home and meet him in the sky and that longing and that craving keeps us coming back he keeps us coming back to the well it keeps us coming back to the word it keeps us coming back no how to heart heart the pastor preaches and slaps you side to head you come back and get it again why because you won't be circumcised out of you you want to be able to receive the promised land you don't want to wander around for 40 years of your life and not get a reward for it you know it's one of the most scariest things and i'm not trying to pick on anybody y'all probably good but this is just to encourage you but that's one of the most scariest things to me is people that's been around since the prophet was alive and they've said in these meetings and they want to ride back on the ah i've been in the message 50 years that scares me that scares me cause i ain't been in the message long enough but i pray to god the message is inside of me i pray that god each and every you and you that that message is inside of you that it's become part of you you're not just in the message with the messages in you it's in you oh my john chapter 14 we have a promise let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you do we believe jesus would we believe jesus was the son of god do we believe that he was god embodied in flesh that walked amongst us that when he says me and my father are one he wasn't just telling the story it was the truth okay so if he's telling the truth if he's given us an example and stories that i just believe what he said and he says if it was not so i would have told you because i'm here to tell you all truth i'm here to tell you everything you have need of why do i need to start a question did he tell us all to us come on y'all heard it well i don't know if jesus really told us everything no he told us everything we needed to know the problem is we rely upon knowledge and intellect more than we rely upon the spirit of god if it were not told so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you if he's going to prepare a place for me i can't wait to get to that place there's a longing inside of me to go find out what that place is and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive unto you myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know not but you know what i'm coming back for you if he goes on he says but i ain't going to leave you comfortless i'll send the spirit unto you i'll send the holy spirit out of you that's why it's so important that you have that because he realized you couldn't do it without the holy ghost oh we can go on and on and on and on and on but we find the disciples begin to wonder about like they was lost and didn't know what to do jesus had died he was hung on the cross he was placed in the tomb oh they get all so discouraged and upset and then they go to the tomb and find out the rock's been a road away and the body's not there they walk with this man this man spoke unto them parable this man spoken to them explaining revelation after revelation he told them bury this temple kill this temple take it down in three days it'll rise up again but yet they look and go oh they must have come got the body everybody like some of us message believers oh can you believe what russia is going to do yeah sure can they go and push a button and the bombs coming over here but i gotta promise i'm gonna be gone before that bomb falls we've got word telling us this day that we're living in is going to be the most absurd and insanity day of all time brother branham said they would go totally insane they have gone totally insane if they get much more i don't know if we can take it but god knows just how much we can take so i have to rest back in his word and say god you're fulfilling it i'm not going to get in the way i'm not going to get up here and get on my little self-tantrum and tell everybody what i think about it but i want to try to get up there and yield myself to be god and say god you speak to your people you encourage your people you let your people know this is your plan you're fulfilling every scripture along the way and so therefore because the disciples i'm trying to hurry now because the disciples was wondering how would this be but one of them happened to think he says you know what he said he wouldn't leave us alone he'd send the spirit back to comfort us and so they would gather together and begin to pray at the day of pentecost they would begin to pray before god ahead not what i thought not what man said not what i understood but you said three days you would raise up again and you would send your spirits god here we are believe it you're just going to take that for a bride y'all we can't just sit around and wait on somebody else to believe for us we can't just sit around and wait for the other the pastor to wrap us up in a rope and drag us into a rapture no it's going to take a bride of god that believes what god is saying in scripture that believes there is a rapture to come that believes there is a land over there that'll come together and sacrifice their life sacrifice their will be sacrifice their job sacrifice their reputation and say but sadness they would come you said and we know god delivered on his father's sent down a ball of fire broke into all of those sitting in that room they come out speaking in unknown tongues you know you know you know acts 2 38 you know impressive thing to me is is everybody heard it in their own language everybody debates about the speaking in tongues hey i've seen speaking in tongues that's wonderful but i've never been blessed enough to understand tongues i've never been given the opportunity to have a prophecy out of that that wasn't my gift but you know what there stood all of these worldly people and they could hear it in their own tongue what was it god fulfilling his word that this day of pentecost was to come and he did it again and he did it again and we get to us first thessalonians 4. we know it don't we but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them that which are asleep that you saw or not neither as others which have no hope oh god thank you for hope for we believe that jesus died and rose again and we believe that right ain't there ain't no use going any further unless we believe that he died and he rose again so we believe that even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring him with him see god sent a prophet to understand what sleep meant sleep ain't sleeping he said christian never dies they just sleep all of our lost loved ones all of our born-again loved ones that we have lost by the way of the grave they're not dead they're just on the other side of the chasm they're just on the other side of the death river of jordan and they're sitting there waiting on us to go into that land oh they could probably see the land better than we can because they've already crossed death's door they're already standing there they know that it's true and they're looking back saying come on just a little bit more we can make it home we're sleeping jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which also alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are sleep for the lord himself said he's saying from heaven with a shout the voice of an archangel the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain well that's us put your listening devices on he's talking to us oh i've read this scripture a hundred times but as it settled here see so many of us we know the rapture of scripture we can quote it word for word and not miss a beat but have we allowed it to unite with the spirit of god that's inside of us you want that fire to get bigger let that word start fueling that fire for fire to get bigger he's got to have some fuel some of us suffocate the holy ghost out we don't give you no fuel but if we open up and we begin to read more we begin to listen more we begin to pray more we begin to feed this more than we've ever fed it shows who you are then which was alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord you know i love verse 18. revelation is gone now so nobody wants to quote it for comfort one another with these words why because he knew when he was on the horizon he knew what we would be he knew the discouragement he knew the depression of this day he knew the mental warfare and he's trying to let us know comfort one another with these words so when i walk up to my brother i go to thomas i'm going in a rapture how about you oh i'm going in the rapture too brother well praise god we've got something to worship about i don't care how sick i am i don't care what the devil is doing to my family i've got something to praise him about because i have a promise that there is a land and in that land is my dwelling place and the rapture message in 65 brother brennan says now the rapture is only he says the rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride no wonder the rest of the world can't get it it ain't for them the promise wasn't to the israelites that wandered in the wilderness the promise wasn't for the israelites they come across in war and then followed the spies of the lion's fathers the lying preachers of their day and no wonder it wasn't for them they couldn't see it but the elected bride of god could see the promised land the elected bride of god could see joshua is anointed of the holy one ain't no different in our day for you elected of god she is chosen for the rapture not because you said in earth not because you believe brother helen was a prophet they all believed moses was a prophet they all was in his church but there was a bride that rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride remember the bride said in the rest of the day he said and the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years the great rapture it's not a rapture friends where we're where are we at he says what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there is going to be a rapture the bride said the bible says there will be and that's and that is only for the elected the elect lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church come on brother jonathan what's your promise i'm going to meet him in the sky one day i got a rapture coming see maybe i ain't been over there as much as y'all have but god's allowed me to go across jordan a couple of times and see what that promised land is coming to be he's letting me catch a glimpse of the blueprint but i know what he's doing now i can't put my finger on it i can't tell you exactly what it's going to be like but i know it's real because i know my god doesn't ever start anything that he don't finish and he started by saying i will go and prepare a place for you and he come back and he said little bride i'm telling you one day there's the sleep shall rise with me and those that are alive and remain will meet me in the air i know that he's coming that promise is real it's become part of my life it is what i'm longing for why because i know there is a land there is a land if you want to stand this morning musicians want to come i want to read one more thing i read the little excerpt about god called ministries remember me reading that shouldn't be stuff for theology but how to visit that land right before that brother brennan makes a comment he says oh how the church ought to look this morning see i'm just a believer that as the prophet of this day he was an extension of god and that he would speak through his prophet to you and i and when he makes comments like that it makes me want to listen how should we look what should we be like oh how the church ought to look this morning to find the spirit working amongst the people oh you mean he didn't say to find the most educated men in the message no oh he didn't say to find the man that knows the most quotes no to find the spirit working amongst the people if you want a church home with the spirit that raised christ from the dead the holy spirit that would move amongst the people that's the spirit that god is raising up in that's the spirit not not a bunch of not a bunch of branham quotas not a bunch of message theologians he's raising a church that is moved by the spirit of god look there was a time in brother brennan's ministry see if i can break this okay there was a time in brother branham's ministry that he would quote and refer to what all the prophets said but then there would come a time that it was a spoken word age and he began to speak what god was saying see there was a time in our lives that we could rely upon and we still can i'm not doing away with the prophet don't even get that in your minds but we heard what he said we knew what he said but now there's a time of manifestation of what he said now there's a time of the bride realizing hey that prophet was speaking about me that prophet was talking about me allowing the spirit of god to move in my life in my church spirit working by the people if you want a home church the spirit is raised across from the dead the holy spirit that will move amongst the people that's the spirit that god is raising up in these last days to take the people over realize you're not going to go over if you don't let him move in you to take the people over into that other land into the full promise of the blessings of god into the full commission that he gave or to that promise the promise is unto you and to your children as israel sought for the promised land knowing that it was somewhere because they had been somebody there before so is the church today we know that there is a land somewhere there's a power somewhere because there's been others over there we know that that land leads me on the river we know we're headed towards this morning trying to go into that promised land how do we know because we have the evidence of those that have crossed over into that word brother brennan says you young ministers you dig into these messages it's all verbatim i don't have it in front of me you dig into this word there's nuggets there why because he knew we wouldn't we would need to hear messages of encouragement we would need to hear get your thinking aside there is a land to come let's say that word prayer before you sing your place of it heavenly father lord look i believe every unction every breath every life that i have i'm going in a rapture and there is a land to come and god i'm so hungry for it god if it's me that's henry god i asked you to speak to me and let me make what's right is right lord you see a group of people this morning lord i have full confidence in the church and the pastor in them that there's a longing in them to see that land there's a longing in them lord to escape the reality of 2020 i step
