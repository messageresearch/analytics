[52:12] my health
[52:22] oh
[52:29] [Music]
[52:40] uh
[53:27] i was on that bible application this
[53:29] morning too and then
[53:31] the description for the daily devotional
[53:33] was at
[53:35] first uh
[53:38] we got shot really well but the first
[53:40] one
[53:52] that's
[53:53] not what i thought
[54:22] everyone's out to
[54:23] take care of themselves and whether uh
[54:27] whatever happens
[54:29] it doesn't make no difference
[54:30] you know that the scriptures talk about
[54:33] that
[54:34] that could be time
[54:47] um
[55:16] and that's the difference between
[55:17] christians
[55:18] and everyone
[55:33] [Music]
[55:46] it has to be
[56:11] you know reading god's word
[56:14] sometimes
[56:43] this is the right way to go
[56:45] you know sometimes you keep watching to
[56:46] see what you'll do and i'll just read
[56:49] this chapter here
[56:51] the spirit of the lord
[56:52] god is upon me and
[56:55] everyone knows the church of jesus
[56:59] but i was just going to read this whole
[57:01] chapter this morning
[57:03] the spirit of the lord god was upon me
[57:05] because the lord has anointed me to
[57:06] preach good
[57:10] find out the times arms praying liberty
[57:13] to the catholics and the opening of the
[57:16] christians to them that are bound to
[57:17] that
[57:18] that scripture approached
[57:20] this morning anyone in this place is
[57:22] born can be free this morning
[57:30] [Music]
[57:39] into that point this morning and you
[57:41] don't want to be there for it and it
[57:43] goes on to accord respond to them and
[57:45] mourn desire to give on to them
[57:48] an oil of joy for mourning and the
[57:51] garment of praise for the spirit
[58:21] and the desolations of many generations
[58:24] and restrictions will stand to be your
[58:26] loss and the sons of aliens will be your
[58:28] flounder in your mind
[58:30] that ye shall be named the fruit
[58:33] of the lord man shall call you the
[58:34] ministers of god
[58:36] and you shall eat the rich of the
[58:38] gentiles from their lord so you lose
[58:41] yourself so the scripture is talking
[58:44] about the crime we're about to go into
[58:45] right now
[58:47] you're saying you shall not help them
[59:08] [Music]
[59:17] actually doing the same thing and
[59:19] there's seeds will be known about the
[59:21] income and their offspring among the
[59:23] people all that see them shall
[59:26] acknowledge that they may better receive
[59:28] which will lower that's what i was very
[59:30] very joyful my soul should be joyful and
[59:33] my god
[59:34] for he has called me with the garments
[59:36] of salvation
[59:38] and he has
[59:39] covered me with the resurrection
[59:41] of god
[59:43] on
[59:44] adorns him
[59:46] for the earth bring us forth our blood
[59:48] that the garden causes things that are
[59:51] shown in the spring forest so the lord
[59:54] god will cause righteousness and praise
[59:56] to spring forth before all nations
[1:00:10] [Applause]
[1:00:24] um
[1:00:39] december 19 1954 and i'll just leave
[1:00:43] you closer
[1:00:44] oh and oh i have received
[1:00:47] and that goes back by saying earlier
[1:00:49] have you really received
[1:00:51] that penalizer in the heart this morning
[1:00:54] if you receive jesus you receive
[1:00:56] something that tells you that
[1:00:58] when the word of god is inspired he is
[1:01:00] the same lord jesus tonight performing
[1:01:03] and doing the very same things that he
[1:01:06] said he would do
[1:01:07] and
[1:01:16] i hope i don't lose my voice he said he
[1:01:19] would do
[1:01:20] where you have to receive the lord
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:36] to say not only that
[1:01:39] but you know and also all the devils in
[1:01:41] hell cannot take it away from why sure
[1:01:44] you believe it god has done say said son
[1:01:47] and son let us say the lord you thank
[1:01:50] your hopes right there you live and die
[1:01:52] you believe
[1:01:53] anyhow
[1:01:54] you're ready to show your testimony with
[1:01:56] your brother at any time and if you
[1:01:58] believe it's the truth you notice that
[1:02:01] god has said so
[1:02:03] and somehow
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:18] that's the only thing about
[1:02:20] i know i say this a lot it's not being
[1:02:22] funny here
[1:02:23] but
[1:02:24] when people look on the outside they
[1:02:26] can't tell who you really are
[1:02:28] you know god knows who you are
[1:02:30] you know who you are this morning and
[1:02:32] what you really want to be is that
[1:02:34] genuine christian where the love of god

[1:37:46] way until the rapture all the way until
[1:37:48] the time that you catch us out of here

[1:37:52] the world and lord we know that your
[1:37:54] bride will not have any part of the
[1:37:56] destruction or the judgments that fall

[1:38:35] we'll be united with you forever
[1:38:38] so shall we ever be with the lord and we
[1:38:40] just ask god that you prepare us this
[1:38:41] morning
[1:38:42] lord and bless the meditation of our
[1:38:44] heart and that which we feel you've laid
[1:38:46] upon our laid upon our hearts
[1:38:48] to minister this morning may it edify
[1:38:50] the body of christ for we ask it in your
[1:38:53] precious name the name of the lord jesus
[1:38:55] christ amen and amen turn your bibles if
[1:38:57] you will and uh i want to
[1:39:00] i i was something the other day and this
[1:39:02] thought came to me and and i told my
[1:39:05] wife i says i believe the lord just gave
[1:39:07] me a
[1:39:08] a brand new message
[1:39:09] a message that i don't ever remember a
[1:39:12] preacher preaching and that i've never
[1:39:13] preached
[1:39:15] and i was like oh that sounds bad
[1:39:19] anything that new right
[1:39:21] oh my but anyway so
[1:39:24] i will just i'm sure somebody has before
[1:39:27] but it's uh the the main theme of it i
[1:39:30] have preached on many times but
[1:39:32] the title that i will use and kind of
[1:39:35] the thought will be a little bit
[1:39:37] different
[1:39:38] but it's found it's found in the 22nd
[1:39:41] chapter of first chronicles is where we
[1:39:44] want to start chronicles first quran
[1:39:46] equals 22.
[1:39:56] it was where david was wanting to build
[1:39:57] the house of the lord and i guess he got
[1:39:59] to bring a lot of the lumber and timbers
[1:40:02] and things together but the lord refused
[1:40:04] for him to build the house
[1:40:07] he said you know he's not going to build
[1:40:09] it because he said he's
[1:40:11] had too much blood on his hands because
[1:40:13] of all the people i guess that he's
[1:40:15] killed
[1:40:16] and so forth and he said but his son
[1:40:18] solomon would build it amen
[1:40:21] and so in chapter 22 of first chronicles
[1:40:24] and verse 7 will begin
[1:40:26] he says and
[1:40:30] all right got a little glitch there
[1:40:33] david said to solomon my son as for me
[1:40:36] it was in my mind to build a house unto
[1:40:39] the name of the lord my god
[1:40:41] but the word of lord came to me saying
[1:40:43] thou shalt thou has shed blood
[1:40:45] abundantly
[1:40:47] and has made great wars thou shalt not
[1:40:50] build an house unto my name because thou
[1:40:52] has shed much blood upon the earth in my
[1:40:56] sight
[1:40:57] behold a son shall be born unto thee who
[1:41:00] shall be a man of rest and i will give
[1:41:02] him rest from all of his enemies round
[1:41:05] about for his name shall be solomon and
[1:41:08] i will give peace and quietness unto
[1:41:10] israel
[1:41:11] in his days
[1:41:14] may god that is the reading of the words
[1:41:16] you can be seated
[1:41:17] amen and i want to
[1:41:19] take this thought and my title is going
[1:41:22] to be
[1:41:23] rest
[1:41:24] from our enemies
[1:41:27] rest
[1:41:28] from our enemies
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:32] well y'all aren't too excited about that
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:35] [Laughter]
[1:41:38] amen
[1:41:39] you know
[1:41:40] and i got to thinking of how that we're
[1:41:42] in a battle you know and not the wars
[1:41:44] that we have and and the enemies that we
[1:41:47] face right
[1:41:48] amen and i on the way on the way to
[1:41:50] church you know i was trying to tell my
[1:41:51] wife uh you know that my title and i
[1:41:54] said peace with our enemies and just
[1:41:56] didn't quite sound right you know
[1:41:58] because you you have to have
[1:42:00] you have to have some kind of an
[1:42:01] agreement or something with an enemy to
[1:42:03] have peace with him right
[1:42:05] but not necessarily peace but just rest
[1:42:08] from it right
[1:42:10] rest from our enemies amen
[1:42:12] so i want to read a couple more if i can
[1:42:15] there's quite a few scriptures here and
[1:42:17] and i begin to think about that rest
[1:42:19] from our enemies because i got to
[1:42:21] thinking of how that
[1:42:22] different places that the bible talked
[1:42:24] about in the old testament how that the
[1:42:27] lord would actually give israel rest
[1:42:30] from their enemies
[1:42:34] okay over in estra if you want to go
[1:42:36] with me esther
[1:42:43] and this of course as you know
[1:42:46] uh haman i believe it was you know that
[1:42:48] tried to destroy the whole
[1:42:51] uh jewish
[1:42:53] nation he tried to destroy them all and
[1:42:55] i believe it's kind of a type of the
[1:42:57] satan now that he tries to destroy us
[1:43:00] isn't that right
[1:43:01] amen and of course because of esther and
[1:43:04] mordecai and the intercession that was
[1:43:07] done and so forth that mordecai and his
[1:43:10] sons ended up hanging on the gallows and
[1:43:12] they were the ones that ended up
[1:43:14] destroyed right
[1:43:16] you know and here towards the end of the
[1:43:18] book if you want to go with me in esther
[1:43:20] the ninth chapter
[1:43:22] um
[1:43:26] in verse
[1:43:29] 16 we'll start and we'll read the verse
[1:43:32] 22
[1:43:33] but the other jews that were in the
[1:43:35] king's provinces gathered themselves
[1:43:37] together and stood for the for their
[1:43:39] lives
[1:43:40] and had rest from their enemies
[1:43:44] and slew of their foes 70 and 5 000 and
[1:43:48] they laid not their hands on the prey
[1:43:51] on the 13th the day of the month of ada
[1:43:53] month of adar
[1:43:55] and on the 14th day of the same rested
[1:43:58] day and they made a day of feasting
[1:44:01] and gladness praise the lord
[1:44:04] isn't that nice how many believes that
[1:44:07] whenever you are in a major battle with
[1:44:10] your enemies a good time to feast
[1:44:13] and rest
[1:44:15] and
[1:44:16] a time of gladness
[1:44:19] amen praise the lord you know brother
[1:44:21] david
[1:44:22] he asked me to if he could read that uh
[1:44:25] let that that quote
[1:44:28] about peace and shalom you know and i
[1:44:30] thought that's that's a good thing to do
[1:44:32] and i believe it was the first song that
[1:44:34] he sang was so rest little bride rest
[1:44:38] for all is well
[1:44:40] amen i like that word
[1:44:42] amen to rest
[1:44:44] and that's what we're going to focus on
[1:44:46] a little bit talk about peace we're
[1:44:48] going to talk about rest amen and
[1:44:50] gladness and i notice he says so they
[1:44:51] made a day
[1:44:53] of feasting and gladness but the jews
[1:44:56] that were in shusham
[1:44:58] shushan assembled together
[1:45:00] on the 13th day thereof and on the 14th
[1:45:04] there are thereof and on the 15th there
[1:45:07] a day of the same they rested and made
[1:45:10] it a day of feasting and gladness
[1:45:15] therefore the jews of the villages that
[1:45:17] dwelt in the unwalled towns made the
[1:45:20] 14th day of the month adar a day of
[1:45:23] gladness and feasting
[1:45:26] and a good day
[1:45:29] amen how many can you some good days
[1:45:33] oh yeah i believe that we need good days
[1:45:35] we should appreciate good days we got
[1:45:37] enough bad days
[1:45:39] but it's nice here there was actually
[1:45:42] making a holiday of a good day and
[1:45:44] gladness and so forth and to send
[1:45:46] portions one to another and mordecai
[1:45:49] wrote these things and sent letters unto
[1:45:51] all the
[1:45:53] jews that were in the provinces of the
[1:45:55] king
[1:45:56] hazaria some azarias
[1:45:59] yeah you probably won't know if i didn't
[1:46:01] spell it right so we'll just leave that
[1:46:02] alone right
[1:46:03] all right not spell it let's say it both
[1:46:05] nigh and far to stash this among them
[1:46:10] that they should keep the
[1:46:12] 14th day of the month eight hour and the
[1:46:14] fiftieth day of the same
[1:46:16] yearly
[1:46:17] i mean this is supposed to be done every
[1:46:19] year
[1:46:20] and as the days when the jews rested
[1:46:23] from their enemies
[1:46:26] and the month which was turned unto them
[1:46:29] from sorrow to joy
[1:46:32] amen
[1:46:34] i don't know if you can read between the
[1:46:36] lines a little bit but how many knows
[1:46:37] that you've had a
[1:46:38] day when you've had a day that turned
[1:46:41] from sorrow to joy
[1:46:44] i kind of think that'd be a day that you
[1:46:47] got borned again
[1:46:48] the day that all your burdens were
[1:46:51] lifted and all your taskmasters amen
[1:46:54] they were dead and you didn't have to
[1:46:56] deal with them anymore
[1:46:58] oh i get so excited about this
[1:47:01] to think that the things that used to
[1:47:03] bother you don't bother you anymore
[1:47:09] glory
[1:47:10] it's long ago
[1:47:12] amen
[1:47:13] oh my i know the story says from sorrow
[1:47:17] to joy and from mourning
[1:47:19] into a good day
[1:47:23] oh my
[1:47:25] that they should make them days of
[1:47:27] feasting in joy
[1:47:31] praise the lord aren't you glad that god
[1:47:34] actually made all kinds of feast days
[1:47:36] but here he says he wants to make a day
[1:47:39] that you just feast
[1:47:41] and have joy
[1:47:44] the bible says the joy of the lord is
[1:47:46] our strength
[1:47:48] i believe that
[1:47:50] end of sending portions one to another
[1:47:54] and gifts to the poor
[1:47:57] this is one place that you can find a
[1:47:59] place where the bible does talk about
[1:48:01] giving somebody a gift
[1:48:04] giving gifts to the poor let it be a
[1:48:06] time of rejoicing
[1:48:09] how many believe that's what it's going
[1:48:10] to be when all of this battle is over
[1:48:13] when we get over to glory land it is
[1:48:15] going to be a time of rejoicing and
[1:48:17] praising god and hell is a time of joy
[1:48:22] it just comes to my mind now if whenever
[1:48:24] the the
[1:48:26] angels came to bring the glad tidings of
[1:48:29] jesus that they said that they bring
[1:48:31] glad tidings of great joy
[1:48:37] the bible says that the joy that you and
[1:48:38] i experience it's joy
[1:48:41] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:48:47] amen don't you believe that this morning
[1:48:51] praise the lord
[1:48:52] god is good
[1:48:55] amen
[1:48:58] oh my hallelujah god is good
[1:49:01] again
[1:49:03] i'm so glad that god gives us that that
[1:49:05] place
[1:49:06] and a time
[1:49:08] to rest
[1:49:10] amen
[1:49:16] brother billy last one time he
[1:49:19] said something that
[1:49:21] took me kind of by surprise and i didn't
[1:49:23] know the bible had said it
[1:49:25] but as i was studying this message it
[1:49:27] came back to me
[1:49:29] you know he says that the bible says and
[1:49:31] i found it in proverbs 16 because it's
[1:49:33] just like he said
[1:49:34] verse 7 he says when a man's ways
[1:49:38] please the lord he maketh even his
[1:49:41] enemies to be at peace with him
[1:49:48] now how many knows that in the days of
[1:49:50] the judges of the bible we remember in
[1:49:52] those days that every time that israel
[1:49:55] would get away from the lord
[1:49:57] the lord would sick his enemies on them
[1:49:59] and they'd become slaves to their
[1:50:01] enemies
[1:50:02] they torment him and they do everything
[1:50:04] else i want to know this but i'm so glad
[1:50:07] that we serve a god that's god's control
[1:50:10] of our enemies
[1:50:12] he controls him if he wants to sink him
[1:50:14] on you he will sick him on you if you
[1:50:16] want to get away from god and to have to
[1:50:18] deal with the chastisement
[1:50:21] almighty god all you got to do is get
[1:50:23] away from god a little bit amen i'll
[1:50:25] tell you you'll become tormented
[1:50:28] you'll become sad you'll have a long
[1:50:30] night you'll just have the worst day of
[1:50:32] your life
[1:50:34] i'm so glad that we can walk with the
[1:50:36] lord every day and then we've got a
[1:50:37] shepherd that watches over us
[1:50:40] i don't want him just a sunday morning
[1:50:42] experience i have an experience every
[1:50:44] day
[1:50:45] of walking with him and seeing him
[1:50:47] dealing with me and blessing me and
[1:50:48] helping this to go good to help me to
[1:50:50] have a good day
[1:50:53] every day with jesus is greater than the
[1:50:55] day before
[1:50:58] amen we just don't realize what we got
[1:51:00] folks
[1:51:02] no wonder no wonder the prophet said
[1:51:05] that we ought to be the happiest people
[1:51:07] on the face
[1:51:09] of the earth
[1:51:10] we ought to have the more joy than
[1:51:12] anybody else out there
[1:51:15] we should have exceeding great joy
[1:51:21] that's what he come for i bring you
[1:51:23] tidings of exchanging great joy no
[1:51:26] wonder a couple of young people can get
[1:51:28] so happy in the lord they get
[1:51:30] got to stop their car on the side of the
[1:51:32] road amen they don't care who she is i'm
[1:51:34] dancing hallelujah praise be almighty
[1:51:36] god
[1:51:40] why because the taste of the lord
[1:51:43] that's what we need
[1:51:45] oh my
[1:51:48] good old-fashioned pentecostal
[1:51:50] experience
[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:51:55] oh my
[1:51:57] that's what we need
[1:51:58] you got to have that
[1:52:01] pentecost is not a denomination
[1:52:04] pentecost is an experience
[1:52:06] and every song that comes everybody that
[1:52:08] comes
[1:52:09] got to have a pentecostal experience
[1:52:14] you don't know what it's like to receive
[1:52:15] the baptism of the holy ghost and to be
[1:52:17] able to sing i know you you ask me why
[1:52:20] i'm happy and i don't mind telling you
[1:52:22] why because my sins are gone they're
[1:52:25] underneath the blood
[1:52:27] on the cross of calvary so far removed
[1:52:30] amen
[1:52:31] as darkness is from dawn
[1:52:33] in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:52:36] aren't you glad this morning
[1:52:39] amen
[1:52:41] praise be to god this morning
[1:52:47] how many knows
[1:52:49] life in itself
[1:52:51] is hard
[1:52:53] it's hard it's a battle
[1:52:56] it's stress
[1:52:58] it's a burden
[1:53:00] it's weight
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:02] right
[1:53:04] amen and it it's pressure as the prophet
[1:53:06] of god said
[1:53:08] people everywhere are under pressure
[1:53:11] he said the enemy is coming down
[1:53:14] upon people
[1:53:16] and making them do that the things that
[1:53:18] they don't even really want to do
[1:53:20] but it just makes them do it
[1:53:24] amen it's the age that we're living in
[1:53:28] and have to deal with that pressure
[1:53:30] having to deal with the battle
[1:53:32] that comes with everyday life
[1:53:35] the cares of life
[1:53:37] amen it's so bad any more days until if
[1:53:41] you really don't have parents that teach
[1:53:43] you of the hardships of life
[1:53:46] amen
[1:53:47] and what you've got to do and
[1:53:49] and teach you good you grow up
[1:53:51] and you really don't know how to
[1:53:52] function
[1:53:54] that's our millennials that's the kids
[1:53:56] that are out there nowadays tearing our
[1:53:58] cities down
[1:53:59] kids that didn't have parents who would
[1:54:01] help them
[1:54:02] didn't have teachers to teach them right
[1:54:04] i actually taught them wrong
[1:54:06] huh
[1:54:09] so you see why the puppet of god said
[1:54:10] it'll be annihilated it'll become
[1:54:12] extinct
[1:54:13] in a generation or two you won't you
[1:54:15] know won't you won't be able to function
[1:54:18] because of the pressures that come along
[1:54:19] with it
[1:54:21] but aren't you glad this morning that
[1:54:22] there's somewhere you can go
[1:54:25] i'm so glad that you can get rest
[1:54:28] i want to tell you something right now
[1:54:29] one of the main main things
[1:54:32] that that your desire and people desire
[1:54:35] to have in life
[1:54:37] is peace
[1:54:39] and rest
[1:54:40] and joy
[1:54:41] and comfort
[1:54:44] i know there's a big word said really
[1:54:46] fast but in detail people want to be
[1:54:49] comforted
[1:54:51] they want to have and that's why jesus
[1:54:53] he was said i'm going to send you
[1:54:56] the comforter
[1:54:57] because he knew
[1:54:59] where the stake that we were in
[1:55:01] he knew the battles that you and i were
[1:55:03] he knew that the enemy that was within
[1:55:07] that you're born with
[1:55:09] this flesh
[1:55:11] that is the real enemy
[1:55:13] [Applause]
[1:55:15] praise be the god the desires of this
[1:55:17] flesh the lusts of this flesh
[1:55:21] amen
[1:55:22] that's your biggest enemy
[1:55:26] all right
[1:55:28] so now let's look
[1:55:29] because i'm here to tell you
[1:55:31] oh my because peace and rest
[1:55:34] go hand in hand isn't that right
[1:55:36] when you're not at war
[1:55:38] you're at peace
[1:55:40] and you're resting amen
[1:55:48] and let me just say this the bible says
[1:55:51] that if a man's ways please the lord
[1:55:53] he will cause his enemies to be at peace
[1:55:56] with him
[1:55:57] amen
[1:55:59] i'll say it this way that if you do what
[1:56:02] the lord says
[1:56:03] he will give you his peace
[1:56:06] because that's the ways that you got to
[1:56:08] have to receive this rest from your
[1:56:10] enemies is to do what god said do is
[1:56:14] that right
[1:56:15] when you adhere to the lord do what he
[1:56:18] says
[1:56:19] amen and give your life to him
[1:56:22] then he will give you peace
[1:56:24] from your enemies
[1:56:28] oh i like this
[1:56:31] because jesus said in matthew 11 28 he
[1:56:34] says come on to me
[1:56:36] are you that labor and our heavy laden
[1:56:41] we are living with this world this heavy
[1:56:44] lady it's got a heavy load
[1:56:46] it's burdened
[1:56:48] it's stressed
[1:56:52] it's not full of gladness
[1:56:56] oh my
[1:56:57] do them people that got all those nose
[1:56:59] rings and earrings and that do they look
[1:57:01] happy to you no no they don't look happy
[1:57:05] they don't have the smile they're
[1:57:07] burdened they're they're captured it's
[1:57:10] an evil wicked hairy demon that makes
[1:57:13] them do those things
[1:57:15] it makes so many torches and oh man
[1:57:17] it'll make them do all kinds of things
[1:57:19] just to try to feel a little better
[1:57:22] try to feel better about themselves or
[1:57:25] try to feel important
[1:57:28] huh
[1:57:32] oh my because that's what they want
[1:57:35] and i listen that are heavy laden and i
[1:57:39] will give you rest
[1:57:44] i don't know if anybody can live
[1:57:46] consistently constantly under a
[1:57:50] battle condition
[1:57:52] can you imagine living in a home where
[1:57:54] the husband and the five for the wife
[1:57:56] were constantly fighting
[1:58:00] huh
[1:58:02] folks i find me another house or what
[1:58:06] it's like for a man to live with a
[1:58:08] contentious woman
[1:58:12] oh here we go
[1:58:14] and down here where we live
[1:58:16] what does the bible say where is it
[1:58:18] better to live than to live with a
[1:58:19] contentious woman
[1:58:22] on the rooftop i think it said
[1:58:24] better to live on the roof let me get up
[1:58:26] on the roof
[1:58:28] why because nobody likes that kind of
[1:58:30] atmosphere
[1:58:31] nobody likes a battling and fighting and
[1:58:34] fussing and streaming a
[1:58:37] stressful atmosphere
[1:58:41] it's not the atmosphere that got meant
[1:58:43] for us to be in
[1:58:45] no
[1:58:47] i can't even tell you how many times now
[1:58:49] the god of peace keep you not a god of
[1:58:51] peace not the god of peace and keep you
[1:58:54] keep your hearts and so forth all
[1:58:55] through the new testament all over the
[1:58:57] place
[1:58:58] amen the whole kingdom of god even the
[1:59:00] very kingdom of god is paul said
[1:59:02] not meat and drink but it's
[1:59:04] righteousness peace and joy in the holy
[1:59:07] ghost that's all kingdom that's what
[1:59:09] it's all about
[1:59:14] to have peace in your heart to have rest
[1:59:17] in your heart
[1:59:19] to be at rest god
[1:59:21] worked seven days six days and on the
[1:59:23] seventh day rested
[1:59:26] that whole sabbath day the whole thing
[1:59:29] was a type
[1:59:31] it was a symbol
[1:59:33] of a great thing that you and i were
[1:59:35] going to have need of
[1:59:37] that's rest
[1:59:39] because he would have battle it was
[1:59:41] going to be hot
[1:59:42] he knew there was going to be some
[1:59:44] bunch of enemies coming after you and
[1:59:46] that you were going to have to fight a
[1:59:47] bunch of wars
[1:59:51] huh
[1:59:52] there's going to be a lot of battles
[1:59:55] but praise be to god
[1:59:57] when those battles end
[2:00:00] huh and you get a little rest from those
[2:00:02] battles
[2:00:05] amen
[2:00:07] brother troy shaking his head he knows
[2:00:09] what a long hard battle is amen
[2:00:13] all of us a lot of us know what a long
[2:00:15] hard battle is
[2:00:18] it's a wonder it's a wonder we can keep
[2:00:20] our seats sometimes or i can keep from
[2:00:22] running up and around here why because
[2:00:24] you also appreciate what god does for
[2:00:27] you
[2:00:30] you love him this morning
[2:00:32] oh my
[2:00:34] i will
[2:00:36] give you rest take my yoke upon me and
[2:00:38] learn to me for i am meek and lowly in
[2:00:41] heart and here he uses the word again
[2:00:43] and he shall find rest
[2:00:47] unto your souls
[2:00:51] he's not necessarily dealing with your
[2:00:53] flat sheet dealing with
[2:00:55] your soul because that's what a burden
[2:00:58] is
[2:01:00] huh
[2:01:04] it's in your soul
[2:01:09] all right
[2:01:12] isaiah 14 i think it's the last
[2:01:15] scripture he says the bible about
[2:01:17] the scripture says
[2:01:21] there is no rest saith the lord
[2:01:24] for the wicked
[2:01:26] right here it is
[2:01:28] not 14 the last verse
[2:01:32] hold on
[2:01:36] all right
[2:01:37] i have somewhere in there okay
[2:01:40] but that's what he says he said that
[2:01:41] there is no rest for the wicked
[2:01:44] there is no peace for the wicked i mean
[2:01:46] believe that
[2:01:47] but look at the world you think i have
[2:01:49] peace
[2:01:51] no what is this what is these battles
[2:01:53] that's going on in ukraine and russia
[2:01:55] and so forth and you know all down to
[2:01:58] the 60s and south there's always been
[2:02:00] war afghanistan saudi arabia one after
[2:02:03] another brother bound says that's all
[2:02:04] that is it's a bunch of devils that get
[2:02:07] jealous of each other or they get greedy
[2:02:09] for land
[2:02:11] it's either greed or it's jealousy or
[2:02:14] it's envy or it's something it has to do
[2:02:16] with the devil and they never have peace
[2:02:21] but that's not for the child of god
[2:02:24] how he believes we have peace
[2:02:26] we have rest
[2:02:28] we don't have to be like that
[2:02:30] praise be to god i'm glad
[2:02:33] i am so glad
[2:02:39] let me tell you
[2:02:40] read your quote in the story
[2:02:42] brother bannon went and he made a sick
[2:02:44] call to a hospital one time there was a
[2:02:46] young lady
[2:02:47] that had gotten some kind of a disease
[2:02:49] and so forth and the doctors couldn't
[2:02:51] even do anything for her anymore
[2:02:53] she had taken some all kinds of
[2:02:55] different things they had given her up
[2:02:56] not no methods nothing they could do
[2:02:58] anything more medically and she had been
[2:03:01] as a child
[2:03:04] you know she had been part of the
[2:03:05] tabernacle i guess
[2:03:07] and she was going out to meet god just a
[2:03:09] child and i said sister do you remember
[2:03:10] on the cradle roll
[2:03:12] you were baptized into the fellowship of
[2:03:13] the cradler roll and said what was what
[2:03:16] what was the matter he said and she said
[2:03:19] brother branham
[2:03:20] i'll tell you said i just love the lord
[2:03:22] jesus but it's so hard to serve him
[2:03:26] now that is what i find around most
[2:03:29] christian lives
[2:03:31] most he says i hate to say it it's true
[2:03:32] that most people that profess
[2:03:34] christianity they just seem to have such
[2:03:36] a hard time struggling time to hold on
[2:03:44] yeah
[2:03:46] oh my i believe it's because of a lack
[2:03:48] of correct teaching there's no such
[2:03:50] thing as holding on he done the holding
[2:03:52] on he says the whole christian principle
[2:03:55] is based upon rest
[2:03:59] i don't
[2:04:00] like i said i preached it before but not
[2:04:02] in the
[2:04:04] context of it
[2:04:06] because listen based upon rest come unto
[2:04:09] me all ye labor and are heavy laden i
[2:04:11] will give you rest in other words you
[2:04:14] ain't got to struggle like that you
[2:04:16] don't have to fight like that
[2:04:20] oh my
[2:04:22] i believe the bible says one place that
[2:04:24] we are to labor to enter into this rest
[2:04:27] we're to struggle we're to battle
[2:04:30] but when we are done with the battle
[2:04:33] then we have fellowship that we have
[2:04:35] communion with god
[2:04:38] amen
[2:04:40] now again he says you don't have to
[2:04:42] worry and struggle you're just resting
[2:04:44] that's all you're giving rest you enter
[2:04:47] into peace
[2:04:49] the whole thing is finished
[2:04:53] oh my when i think about it
[2:04:56] now that's what
[2:04:58] god was trying to get israel to get into
[2:05:00] that place of rest
[2:05:06] that place of rest we find it in hebrews
[2:05:09] we'll just go to hebrews right quick
[2:05:11] hebrews 4.
[2:05:19] let us therefore fear not well i
[2:05:21] actually go one scripture before that
[2:05:25] before the fourth chapter refuses the
[2:05:27] third chapter of hebrews
[2:05:29] and uh
[2:05:31] verse 17 we'll pick it up but with whom
[2:05:34] was he grieved 40 years was it not with
[2:05:36] them that had sinned and whose carcasses
[2:05:38] fell in the wilderness or disbelieved
[2:05:41] and this talks all all this
[2:05:43] chapter beforehand he talks about how he
[2:05:45] swore his wrath they would not enter
[2:05:47] into his rest
[2:05:48] so beware brothers unless there be in
[2:05:51] any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
[2:05:53] departing from the living god but with
[2:05:56] whom was he greed forty years was it not
[2:05:57] with them that had sinned and his
[2:05:58] carcasses fell in the wilderness and to
[2:06:00] whoms were he that they should not enter
[2:06:03] into his rest but to them that believe
[2:06:06] not
[2:06:08] now how many knows that is your real
[2:06:10] battle
[2:06:11] that is my real battle if you'll ever
[2:06:13] get past the fact that the devil will
[2:06:15] try to tell you all you ain't good
[2:06:17] enough to be a son of god ain't no we he
[2:06:19] chose you
[2:06:21] ain't no way you're the bride
[2:06:24] and for i said i've been christians a
[2:06:25] long time you've made mistakes in your
[2:06:27] past how many knows that the devil will
[2:06:29] try to tell you no your sin isn't really
[2:06:32] forgiven
[2:06:34] now you're still guilty so that he can
[2:06:36] have you sitting in your pew with a long
[2:06:38] face
[2:06:40] make you feel condemned but it's a lie
[2:06:43] how many knows it's under the blood god
[2:06:45] under the blood of jesus christ
[2:06:47] and all of the doubt and all of the
[2:06:49] unbelief you've gotta get away from that
[2:06:51] and if you ever break through that
[2:06:53] barrier of unbelief
[2:06:55] oh my sometimes it's supposed to happen
[2:06:57] about 12 13 14 years old that's when
[2:07:00] we're to break through but some kind of
[2:07:01] a spirit and when it gets on us it
[2:07:03] causes us not to get it when we're
[2:07:05] supposed to
[2:07:07] thank god for the young folks that get
[2:07:09] it that's 16 17 18 amen before they go
[2:07:11] too far
[2:07:13] because the problem of god said 80 or 90
[2:07:15] of people that ever served god do it
[2:07:17] around the age of 18 through 20 or
[2:07:19] somewhere in there
[2:07:21] hello
[2:07:22] and otherwise they become what they
[2:07:24] become hello
[2:07:27] not the cop can't but listen
[2:07:30] so let's go on shall we
[2:07:33] that unbelief that's the real battle
[2:07:36] how many knows
[2:07:38] think about it
[2:07:42] before you ever come to this place
[2:07:44] before you ever come to this place
[2:07:47] of
[2:07:48] resting
[2:07:50] from your enemies
[2:07:52] and until you before you get to that
[2:07:54] place of rest for yourself
[2:07:56] there is certainly a real great battle
[2:07:58] that you have to do
[2:08:00] there is something that you have to
[2:08:01] overcome
[2:08:03] because how many knows that
[2:08:05] you know uh
[2:08:06] god is only going to share his throne
[2:08:09] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[2:08:12] sit with me
[2:08:13] you have to be an overcomer
[2:08:17] oh my
[2:08:19] when i think about that i think about
[2:08:21] this i realize that all that are
[2:08:25] his like jesus said all the father has
[2:08:28] given me
[2:08:29] will come to me
[2:08:31] and i will lose none of them
[2:08:34] do you realize it's grace of god that
[2:08:36] gives you the ability to overcome
[2:08:38] unbelief
[2:08:39] write that in your book it's the grace
[2:08:41] of god that gives you the ability to
[2:08:43] overcome and to believe with all of your
[2:08:45] heart
[2:08:46] it's because you are his and he gives
[2:08:48] you that ability
[2:08:52] my that makes me want to run brother
[2:08:55] that might be on the shout
[2:08:57] to think it's his grace
[2:08:59] something that he placed in there
[2:09:02] you know what i like to do when the
[2:09:03] devil tries to tell me i'm not one of
[2:09:05] god's children i just point to that
[2:09:08] see that right there god had never done
[2:09:10] it
[2:09:11] if i wasn't his so shut up
[2:09:14] shut up
[2:09:16] praise be to god
[2:09:18] amen
[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:21] so the bible clearly tells us paul tells
[2:09:24] us
[2:09:25] he says let us fear
[2:09:27] therefore at least the promise being
[2:09:29] left of us entering into his rest any of
[2:09:31] you should seem to come short of it
[2:09:34] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[2:09:36] well as
[2:09:38] to them but the word preached to them
[2:09:39] did not profit them not being mixed with
[2:09:41] faith in them that heard it
[2:09:43] for we which believe have believed do
[2:09:47] enter
[2:09:48] into rest
[2:09:51] brother does that mean all my troubles
[2:09:53] are over does that mean i'm not gonna
[2:09:54] anymore enemies attack me
[2:09:58] job sure did
[2:10:00] let me tell you something how many knows
[2:10:02] he was living it up
[2:10:05] his children were having a party
[2:10:08] drinking wine and having a party
[2:10:11] we don't do that nowadays but they did
[2:10:14] huh
[2:10:15] all in one house having a good day no
[2:10:17] problems
[2:10:19] the enemy was at bay
[2:10:22] are you with me
[2:10:24] i like i like it when the gods gotta hit
[2:10:26] you around me brother i like god's hitch
[2:10:28] i won't i won't
[2:10:32] pull no punch
[2:10:34] it's a whole lot better than when he
[2:10:36] learns to let he chooses to let me go
[2:10:38] through a trial
[2:10:40] huh
[2:10:41] it's a whole lot better
[2:10:45] and i'm here to tell you what does the
[2:10:47] bible say whenever the lord sends you a
[2:10:49] trial no it's not all it's not joyful
[2:10:52] not always joyful
[2:10:56] you know how many knows that with the
[2:10:57] holy ghost
[2:10:58] like it was with job or like it was with
[2:11:00] paul
[2:11:02] that though they were in the inner
[2:11:03] prison yet they sang songs why because
[2:11:06] when you come into this place it don't
[2:11:08] matter what comes your way
[2:11:11] you can still rest
[2:11:16] you can still know this one thing
[2:11:19] you ought to be happy this morning
[2:11:21] you know why
[2:11:22] because you know that when god has taken
[2:11:24] you and when he gives you that seal of
[2:11:26] the holy ghost that you are god's child
[2:11:29] anything that happens to you
[2:11:32] is allowed by god
[2:11:39] amen
[2:11:43] let me see if i can put it the way that
[2:11:45] the bible fits it just comes to mind
[2:11:50] brethren
[2:11:52] count it
[2:11:54] all
[2:11:55] joy
[2:12:00] it's hard to do come on folks count it
[2:12:02] all joy
[2:12:04] when you fall into diverse temptations
[2:12:09] you know i was thinking this week of how
[2:12:11] the devil puts out there for the world
[2:12:13] and for young people all these all this
[2:12:15] this temptation
[2:12:18] very strong temptations
[2:12:23] very very strong temptation and i
[2:12:26] thought but you know what you know why
[2:12:28] god allowed that because if it wasn't
[2:12:30] this temptation it wouldn't be tempting
[2:12:35] right if it wasn't the temptation
[2:12:37] wouldn't be tempting it wouldn't even be
[2:12:38] a temptation it has to be tantalizing it
[2:12:41] has to be a temptation
[2:12:43] and he allowed that
[2:12:44] to give you strength
[2:12:47] to overcome
[2:12:49] diverse knowing this at the trying of
[2:12:52] your faith workers patience and let
[2:12:54] patients have a perfect work that you
[2:12:56] may be perfect and entire wanting or
[2:12:59] lacking nothing
[2:13:01] amen
[2:13:04] praise the lord
[2:13:10] this is about
[2:13:13] hiding
[2:13:18] resting
[2:13:20] is about hiding
[2:13:24] hiding
[2:13:25] from your enemy
[2:13:27] getting into some place she can't find
[2:13:29] you
[2:13:31] the bible says that a believer ought to
[2:13:33] be in such a place that the
[2:13:35] wicked one
[2:13:36] is him not
[2:13:38] huh
[2:13:41] into a place
[2:13:42] that you can't be touched
[2:13:49] now notice in verse 13 he says let no
[2:13:51] man say when he is tempted i am tempted
[2:13:53] of god for god cannot be tempted with
[2:13:55] evil neither attempted to be any man but
[2:13:57] every man is tempted and drawn away from
[2:14:00] from away of his own lusts and enticed
[2:14:02] and when lust has conceived he bringeth
[2:14:04] for sin and sin when he is finished
[2:14:05] bring his forth death what does that
[2:14:07] tell me
[2:14:09] this scripture tells me that the devil
[2:14:12] can't come into you
[2:14:15] you have to get drawn away you've got to
[2:14:17] open the door
[2:14:20] go out to
[2:14:23] him and that's where he gets you
[2:14:26] i may believe lord let me shut in with
[2:14:29] god in that sacred place
[2:14:33] to where the devil can't touch you
[2:14:37] before you begin to meditate on too much
[2:14:39] of the wrong thought you got to let the
[2:14:41] thought come in
[2:14:44] huh
[2:14:45] that's why you got to open the door
[2:14:49] before you lose your peace before you
[2:14:51] lose before he robs you you gotta unlock
[2:14:54] the door
[2:14:57] you gotta go out to him
[2:15:01] that's if you're a real believer
[2:15:03] a real christian
[2:15:05] and trust me the devil is always looking
[2:15:07] how to push your button
[2:15:10] he's always he knows all of us he knows
[2:15:12] where our weak places are he knows where
[2:15:14] to push your button how to push your
[2:15:16] button
[2:15:22] oh
[2:15:24] the crazy part is it brother perry's a
[2:15:26] lot of times it's christians that's
[2:15:28] supposed to be christians that push your
[2:15:29] button they try to push your button
[2:15:31] because they want to see you upset
[2:15:34] they want to
[2:15:35] see you man and so they push your
[2:15:36] buttons and they're supposed to be
[2:15:38] christians
[2:15:44] ah
[2:15:46] that's the sad part i say yes an
[2:15:47] experienced preacher here a lot of us
[2:15:50] know huh
[2:15:53] and even i'm gonna get real down real to
[2:15:56] the nitty-gritty even some of us as
[2:15:58] christians we get backslid
[2:16:00] and we'll do that very same thing
[2:16:03] we'll get backslid
[2:16:05] because how about how
[2:16:07] how if i said that what if i don't come
[2:16:09] up here and say you ain't even believer
[2:16:10] you're you're you're you're not even a
[2:16:12] christian
[2:16:13] and i put a lot of us out there wouldn't
[2:16:15] it
[2:16:16] no but you can get backslid we all know
[2:16:18] you can get backslid
[2:16:20] to where you do things you gotta do
[2:16:22] and if you have
[2:16:24] done it and you know you did it
[2:16:26] well you got a job next week let's go
[2:16:28] make it right
[2:16:31] because that's the one thing a christian
[2:16:32] will do
[2:16:38] that's totally free folks that's just
[2:16:40] from him is that all right
[2:16:42] praise the lord
[2:16:44] yeah when he's tempted or when he opens
[2:16:46] that door to go out
[2:16:48] but we're supposed to be hidden our life
[2:16:50] is supposed to be sealed
[2:16:53] sealed away in christ
[2:16:55] to where he can't get a hold of us
[2:16:57] israel wasn't that way how many knows
[2:16:58] god tried his best to get israel to die
[2:17:01] to themselves and rest in him and trust
[2:17:04] in him
[2:17:06] but they never would do it
[2:17:09] oh my
[2:17:13] but never would and he swore
[2:17:16] or i says they'll never taste my rest
[2:17:18] they'll never know what it's like to be
[2:17:19] at peace
[2:17:22] in other words they'll never have rest
[2:17:23] how many knows that israel never did
[2:17:25] rest majority of them didn't joshua and
[2:17:28] caleb did
[2:17:30] it didn't matter what it was they
[2:17:31] arrested and trusted in god
[2:17:34] but the rest of them constantly were
[2:17:36] complaining and bickering and
[2:17:38] fussing and fighting
[2:17:43] let me let me finish this
[2:17:45] thought of hiding first
[2:17:49] colossians
[2:17:52] if ye then be risen with christ seek
[2:17:54] those things which are above where
[2:17:55] christ sitteth on the right hand of god
[2:17:58] set your affections on things on
[2:18:00] things above and not on things on earth
[2:18:05] for you
[2:18:07] are
[2:18:08] dead
[2:18:10] hallelujah
[2:18:13] think about it and your life is hid
[2:18:16] with christ in god
[2:18:20] that's where we get that head that
[2:18:21] hiding
[2:18:24] a hidden light the prophet of god
[2:18:26] preached
[2:18:30] just comes to mind
[2:18:32] let me read it
[2:18:33] now i find people so struggle
[2:18:38] they so struggle seems like i meet
[2:18:40] people that they say oh it's just such a
[2:18:42] struggle
[2:18:45] have you seen people that way and
[2:18:47] probably people many people sitting here
[2:18:49] before me now
[2:18:50] just the ups and the downs and the ends
[2:18:54] and the house
[2:18:56] oh one day and you're up and the next
[2:18:58] time they are down one day they love the
[2:19:00] lord and tomorrow they're having a
[2:19:02] stretch of struggle holding on the devil
[2:19:05] is so tempting them to have such ups and
[2:19:07] downs you meet somebody else that's on
[2:19:09] the hilltop all the time
[2:19:12] brother there's nothing bothers them at
[2:19:14] all
[2:19:23] let that sink in
[2:19:26] what class are you in
[2:19:29] what class are you in
[2:19:34] if you thought really hard
[2:19:36] you'd probably say boy i'll tell you
[2:19:37] what
[2:19:39] i'll tell you what that got me yesterday
[2:19:41] i i lost i you know
[2:19:46] i wasn't in all the time that really
[2:19:48] bothered me that really got to me
[2:19:51] this really got to me
[2:19:55] you ain't got to raise your hand but
[2:19:56] just your heart see that's me i'm i'm
[2:19:58] sorry lord
[2:20:00] shouldn't let get did get to me like
[2:20:01] that
[2:20:03] huh
[2:20:06] when i thought about this having rest
[2:20:08] for my enemies
[2:20:10] i thought about the chastisement of the
[2:20:12] lord how many know she chastised how he
[2:20:13] corrects you he beats you he will
[2:20:16] discipline you
[2:20:21] but i'm here to tell you as an
[2:20:22] experienced believer that once you learn
[2:20:24] your lesson there's no need for you to
[2:20:25] take that lesson over again
[2:20:29] god can do what he wants but you can
[2:20:30] have rest from that
[2:20:35] just as sure as i hope your mom and
[2:20:37] daddy aren't still spanking you
[2:20:42] you grow up
[2:20:43] you become a man
[2:20:45] you adjust you get past those little
[2:20:47] things
[2:20:49] huh
[2:20:51] then there's a time of rest
[2:20:54] because you've learned your lesson you
[2:20:55] don't have to go back to eighth grade
[2:20:56] you done did that be many years ago
[2:21:00] amen
[2:21:01] there's nothing bothers them at all but
[2:21:03] i'm saying there's bound to be something
[2:21:05] lacking somewhere god's not a respected
[2:21:07] person if he gives that to one person he
[2:21:10] wants all of his children to be that way
[2:21:15] this is where he comes in billy paul
[2:21:17] brother billy paul brother bantam's son
[2:21:20] seeing all the miracles seeing all the
[2:21:21] signs seeing all the wonders every great
[2:21:23] thing that god did through him what was
[2:21:26] the greatest thing about your daddy
[2:21:29] what would he say
[2:21:31] the way that you handle
[2:21:33] he handled every circumstance
[2:21:38] amen don't you want to be that way
[2:21:42] because that's the same way it was with
[2:21:43] jesus
[2:21:44] brother brandon followed jesus in that
[2:21:46] right that's who we're following jesus
[2:21:50] he handled every circumstance
[2:21:53] he was hid away
[2:21:54] in christ
[2:21:57] and if you're hid away in christ
[2:22:00] you don't have to fight those battles
[2:22:02] that you want fought
[2:22:04] you don't have to be in a constant
[2:22:05] struggle
[2:22:06] you don't have to be in a constant
[2:22:08] battle
[2:22:09] amen
[2:22:11] i believe it is at one place he says
[2:22:13] abraham once he once the battle was over
[2:22:16] of the kings and so forth he came back
[2:22:18] and relaxed and had communion and
[2:22:19] fellowship with with uh
[2:22:27] what was his name
[2:22:30] he had fellowship and communion
[2:22:33] with
[2:22:34] god but what was his name
[2:22:37] thank you i'm thinking of that no
[2:22:39] today preacher might need to remember
[2:22:41] that he had fellowship with melchizedek
[2:22:44] is that right
[2:22:46] and that's the way it is with the
[2:22:47] believer after you get yourself he said
[2:22:49] whipped out and you have fellowship
[2:22:53] oh my
[2:22:55] let me tell you something this is where
[2:22:58] paul
[2:22:58] won it
[2:23:02] uh was it the hebrews
[2:23:06] that's where paul was telling
[2:23:08] from the hebrews
[2:23:09] that they should be
[2:23:11] beware be careful make sure
[2:23:14] that you haven't
[2:23:16] not claimed the promise
[2:23:19] and for somehow or other you're not in
[2:23:20] that rest
[2:23:22] be careful make sure
[2:23:23] that you're in that place
[2:23:26] i mean i'll get the place of safety
[2:23:30] it's a place of refuge
[2:23:32] anywhere out there
[2:23:34] it's open season for the devil on you
[2:23:41] think about some of the young folks
[2:23:42] folks and i don't want to get dirty here
[2:23:44] but some of the young people that i have
[2:23:46] been associated with that even come to
[2:23:48] this church
[2:23:49] that i thought were halfway decent
[2:23:51] christians
[2:23:52] a little bit later found out they were
[2:23:54] lesbians
[2:23:55] hello
[2:23:57] turned out to be lesbians
[2:23:58] somehow they didn't get sealed
[2:24:01] god help me you better get sealed in you

[2:24:18] ghost get a real
[2:24:20] good taste of almighty god and know that
[2:24:22] he is so good and once you get a real
[2:24:25] good taste and it changes your soul
[2:24:27] cause it has to be more than just a face
[2:24:29] huh
[2:24:30] once that soul changes it's changed
[2:24:32] forever
[2:24:34] nothing else will ever satisfy
[2:24:37] i'm a witness folks
[2:24:40] nothing else will ever satisfied
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:44] hmm
[2:24:46] he is our satisfaction
[2:24:49] he on me knows the holy spirit
[2:24:52] is your comfort
[2:24:54] i gotta have a nose ringing tattoo i
[2:24:56] don't have to do this out of the other
[2:24:57] have me a mohawk or blue air
[2:25:00] to get a little satisfaction
[2:25:02] no you have comfort already
[2:25:05] you're at peace
[2:25:08] amen
[2:25:11] all right
[2:25:20] my
[2:25:24] peace
[2:25:26] that's why they sang that song
[2:25:27] peace peace
[2:25:31] wonderful peace
[2:25:34] coming down from the father above
[2:25:39] if there's a battle in your life
[2:25:42] well guess what
[2:25:44] he fights all your battles for you when
[2:25:46] you're in that place
[2:25:47] say here lord you see this fight you see
[2:25:50] this that's your lord take care of it
[2:25:54] amen
[2:25:59] joy unspeakable full of glory
[2:26:02] and a man that never knows what it is
[2:26:04] like to live a victorious life until
[2:26:06] he's completely overcome who
[2:26:09] himself
[2:26:10] the biggest enemy you got
[2:26:13] is yourself
[2:26:17] how do you believe that
[2:26:22] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[2:26:23] eye the pride of life
[2:26:26] if you ever conquer the lust of this
[2:26:29] flesh
[2:26:30] huh
[2:26:33] lust of the eye
[2:26:35] pride of life all the things that comes
[2:26:36] with this flesh
[2:26:42] the desires
[2:26:44] that this flesh has now remember one
[2:26:46] place baptized it says when you get born
[2:26:48] again you're going to die to yourself
[2:26:50] and he said not just die but you've got
[2:26:52] to rot
[2:26:54] it's got to be dead
[2:26:56] i mean he knows if there's just a little
[2:26:58] bit of uh uh
[2:26:59] something in you just a little bit a
[2:27:02] little bit alive it'll start sprouting
[2:27:04] it'll just keep going alive
[2:27:08] and i think our biggest battle even as a
[2:27:10] christian is like paul said to every day
[2:27:13] make sure you stay dead
[2:27:18] that's why you die daily
[2:27:20] every day you got to die to yourself
[2:27:22] keep it dead
[2:27:24] because if not
[2:27:26] it ain't long
[2:27:29] and you're way out there
[2:27:31] that's why he said you are dead
[2:27:34] and your life is hid with christ in god
[2:27:38] amen
[2:27:41] all right
[2:27:42] i like it but event 65 64. remember
[2:27:47] he said you know to the church it's
[2:27:49] darkness it's gross
[2:27:51] startness to them
[2:27:54] no peace to them
[2:27:56] no comfort to them
[2:27:59] oh my if the world hears this there's no
[2:28:01] comfort to the people out there in the
[2:28:03] world
[2:28:04] there's no comfort to anybody that
[2:28:06] follows any religion outside of jesus
[2:28:08] christ
[2:28:10] he didn't say come to me and buddha
[2:28:11] muhammad he said come to me and i will
[2:28:14] give you rest he's the only rest there
[2:28:16] is
[2:28:18] this darkness grows darkness
[2:28:21] upon the people upon the earth
[2:28:24] but
[2:28:24] he had a message
[2:28:27] but abandoned had a message to the
[2:28:28] church he called it to the bride
[2:28:31] and he said i say to the church
[2:28:34] god's peace
[2:28:35] peace
[2:28:37] amen in other words good morning god be
[2:28:40] with you god's peace go with you
[2:28:44] hey
[2:28:45] [Laughter]
[2:28:52] amen he didn't realize that uh you know
[2:28:56] 64 here we are almost in 24 22 i guess
[2:29:00] it is this many years people would know
[2:29:03] what he was talking about that they
[2:29:05] would receive and have that peace
[2:29:09] and rejoice in that peace
[2:29:12] amen
[2:29:14] follow peace with all men the bible says
[2:29:16] another scripture says be at peace
[2:29:18] amongst yourselves
[2:29:20] be at peace amongst yourselves
[2:29:26] because the devil doesn't like peace
[2:29:29] he likes
[2:29:30] war
[2:29:32] remember brother branham preaching on
[2:29:35] kind of get off of this mountain and
[2:29:37] head on towards the promised land
[2:29:39] let esau and all he said to all those
[2:29:42] old fighters
[2:29:44] always bickering and some people just
[2:29:46] ain't never happy unless you're in a
[2:29:47] fight
[2:29:49] unless they're causing stress and strife
[2:29:53] that's the very laughing
[2:29:55] and it's the very
[2:29:57] acid of the spit that comes out of the
[2:29:59] devil
[2:30:00] is stress and strife
[2:30:08] just be at peace with yourselves and
[2:30:10] amongst yourselves
[2:30:12] have the same mind
[2:30:14] amen
[2:30:16] let me see if i can find one
[2:30:20] here's one finally brethren farewell
[2:30:22] paul says be perfect be of good comfort
[2:30:26] be of one mind
[2:30:28] live
[2:30:30] in peace
[2:30:33] and the god of love and peace
[2:30:36] shall be with you
[2:30:38] amen
[2:30:41] paul said
[2:30:42] how many knows at the corinthians church
[2:30:45] they were always
[2:30:47] bickering about who was the greatest
[2:30:50] huh whoever spoke in tongues and
[2:30:52] interpreted well they're the most
[2:30:53] spiritual in the church
[2:30:55] they ought to be looked up to got to
[2:30:57] have a little bit of a brownie
[2:30:58] badge huh
[2:31:02] paul says i brethren could not speak to
[2:31:04] you unto you as spiritual as carnal even
[2:31:07] as unto babes
[2:31:08] in christ i fed you with milk
[2:31:10] not with me for hitherto you were not
[2:31:12] able to bear it neither yet now are ye
[2:31:16] able to bear it
[2:31:18] amen
[2:31:20] oh my
[2:31:21] he says for ye are yet carnal whereas
[2:31:23] there is among you
[2:31:24] envying
[2:31:26] strife divisions
[2:31:31] amen
[2:31:33] you get a
[2:31:35] church that's of god you get a people
[2:31:37] that's of god and you get a division in
[2:31:39] that church let me tell you something
[2:31:40] there is a devil at work
[2:31:43] it ain't god at work
[2:31:45] there's a devil at work
[2:31:47] you get a husband and a wife fuss in a
[2:31:50] fight and remember that's not uh
[2:31:52] that's the devil at work trying to tear
[2:31:54] you apart
[2:31:55] trying to get you to split up
[2:31:59] oh my i don't know why all this is but
[2:32:01] is that all right i believe we need it
[2:32:04] you got a good group of people as
[2:32:05] brother david says there's nobody to
[2:32:07] preach and smart in me and i'm sure that
[2:32:08] you appreciate having a group of people
[2:32:10] like this huh
[2:32:12] but the devil don't like that
[2:32:16] no he don't like unity
[2:32:18] he don't like it
[2:32:20] a church that's on fire where god's
[2:32:22] moving he don't like it
[2:32:28] and that's the pastor i can tell you
[2:32:29] exactly where the devil will hit
[2:32:33] somebody that's weak and backslid
[2:32:36] that's a real hit
[2:32:38] you know what he'll hit with
[2:32:40] murmuring
[2:32:41] and complaining
[2:32:43] [Music]
[2:32:46] that's how the devil sounds well now
[2:32:48] this shouldn't be this way and that
[2:32:50] shouldn't be that way and this and the
[2:32:52] other
[2:32:59] well i praise be to god all i can say to
[2:33:01] the person that's right probably
[2:33:03] shouldn't be
[2:33:05] but how about getting
[2:33:06] on your prayer bones and getting god to
[2:33:08] change it instead of trying to change it
[2:33:09] with your mouth and your bad attitude
[2:33:12] it'll only make it worse
[2:33:14] isn't it funny how somebody won't come
[2:33:16] from confront something and go to that
[2:33:18] person no they tell everybody about that
[2:33:19] person
[2:33:21] they got the manhood to go to the person
[2:33:26] it works like that on me it works like
[2:33:28] that on you you'd rather tell somebody
[2:33:29] else
[2:33:33] folks as a pastor you say brother bob
[2:33:35] are you preaching on this is this what
[2:33:36] we need no we don't need this but we
[2:33:39] might in the future
[2:33:40] and one thing's for sure as a pastor i'm
[2:33:42] going to guard against it with all i got
[2:33:45] i want to make sure that we keep that
[2:33:46] devil all the way down under
[2:33:48] our feet and that he don't have no way
[2:33:49] to rise up
[2:33:51] i won't have to confront him you're
[2:33:53] going to confront somebody if they start
[2:33:55] something like that
[2:33:56] because strife and stress that's not
[2:33:59] peace and rest that's the opposite of it
[2:34:02] that's exactly what the devil wants
[2:34:07] is this all right
[2:34:09] i hope this makes us stronger in the
[2:34:10] lord
[2:34:13] all right there's one more scripture if
[2:34:15] i can find it
[2:34:24] sometimes i write these things on the
[2:34:25] back of here
[2:34:28] but anyway you love the lord
[2:34:31] james there it is all the way at the
[2:34:33] bottom of page back to james again
[2:34:40] james
[2:34:41] three
[2:34:44] now if you'll notice there paul said you
[2:34:46] know
[2:34:47] if you still have strife and envy and
[2:34:49] divisions
[2:34:50] you're still carnal
[2:34:54] some people get really smart and wise
[2:34:56] right over in james 3 and verse 13 it
[2:34:59] says who is a wise man and dude with
[2:35:01] knowledge among you let him show out of
[2:35:03] a good conversation his works with
[2:35:05] meekness
[2:35:06] and wisdom
[2:35:07] but if you have bitter envying and
[2:35:10] strife in your hearts hello
[2:35:13] glory not and lie don't lie to yourself
[2:35:17] against the truth this wisdom descendeth
[2:35:19] not from above so where does it come
[2:35:22] from
[2:35:24] hell
[2:35:27] if it causes strife and content remember
[2:35:29] it's of the devil
[2:35:33] and before we get done with our
[2:35:34] conversation i want to tell you
[2:35:36] what
[2:35:38] the holy spirit what the right wisdom
[2:35:40] and the way that it conducts itself and
[2:35:42] how it does
[2:35:43] it doesn't cause strife and contention
[2:35:46] but is earthly
[2:35:49] sensual
[2:35:51] devilish
[2:35:52] for where
[2:35:54] envying
[2:35:55] and strife is
[2:35:57] there is confusion
[2:35:59] in every
[2:36:01] evil
[2:36:02] work
[2:36:05] how many believe paul believed in peace
[2:36:08] he believed in rest
[2:36:11] he believed in the church being of the
[2:36:13] same mind
[2:36:15] of the same thought
[2:36:18] and i believe that
[2:36:20] i believe the church church ought to
[2:36:21] think the same
[2:36:24] speak the same
[2:36:30] oh my and i'm glad that it isn't what i
[2:36:34] say
[2:36:35] or what somebody else says
[2:36:36] but what we think
[2:36:39] is this here
[2:36:41] it's the word of god
[2:36:44] but the wisdom that is from above listen
[2:36:47] if you really have wisdom that's from
[2:36:48] above first it's pure and then
[2:36:52] appeasable
[2:36:56] i'll tell you what when you go to
[2:36:58] correct me somebody brother bram says
[2:36:59] you know go do it real genuine love
[2:37:06] amen
[2:37:08] boy and i'm here to tell you one thing
[2:37:09] right now this
[2:37:11] applies for me
[2:37:12] more than it does you
[2:37:15] because correction comes from where up
[2:37:16] here
[2:37:18] it's got to be done in peace
[2:37:20] and in love
[2:37:23] amen
[2:37:25] the wisdom
[2:37:28] then peaceable
[2:37:30] it's gentle
[2:37:31] it's easily to deal with
[2:37:36] it's easy to deal with
[2:37:39] and treat it
[2:37:40] full of mercy
[2:37:44] in other words now you're just going to
[2:37:45] go to hell because you do that way
[2:37:47] huh no but it's full of mercy
[2:37:50] but god will forgive you
[2:37:52] you know god is gracious
[2:37:54] very merciful we all need grace
[2:37:57] huh
[2:37:59] and good fruits without partiality and
[2:38:01] without hypocrisy
[2:38:03] praise be to god
[2:38:11] talk just a little more we got 20 after
[2:38:13] can i go one more scripture and talk
[2:38:15] about one more
[2:38:16] aspect of this it's in isaiah 14
[2:38:19] isaiah 14.
[2:38:28] remember brother branham he wouldn't
[2:38:29] even debate he says don't fuss i'm not
[2:38:32] going to fuss you don't stand the fuss
[2:38:34] at somebody about the word of god do you
[2:38:36] no you don't even aren't even supposed
[2:38:37] to cry because that's not the holy ghost
[2:38:39] the holy ghost don't fuss
[2:38:40] he says well your family fusses don't
[2:38:42] fuss back just love them
[2:38:45] hatred reach hatred love reach love
[2:38:48] for the lord we'll have mercy on jacob
[2:38:50] and will choose israel and yet choose
[2:38:52] israel and set him in their own land and
[2:38:55] the strangers shall be joined with them
[2:38:58] and they shall cleave to the house of
[2:39:00] jacob
[2:39:01] and the people shall take them and bring
[2:39:03] them to their place and the house of
[2:39:05] israel shall possess them in the land of
[2:39:08] the lord for servants and handmaids
[2:39:12] and they shall
[2:39:13] take them captive
[2:39:15] whose captives they were
[2:39:18] and they shall rule over their
[2:39:21] oppressors
[2:39:25] that's a good way to have peace is to
[2:39:26] rule over the thing that ruled over you
[2:39:30] how many believes that when you are
[2:39:32] totally at peace with god and at rest
[2:39:34] amen you have the devil under your feet
[2:39:36] you are ruling over the thing that has
[2:39:39] ruled over you
[2:39:42] oh my
[2:39:44] and it shall come to pass in that day
[2:39:46] that the lord shall give thee rest from
[2:39:49] thy sorrow and from by fear and from the
[2:39:52] heart bondage wherein thou was made to
[2:39:56] serve
[2:39:58] i wrote down here you know it's now we
[2:40:00] are now telling what once told us what
[2:40:03] to do what once drove us to do what's
[2:40:06] wrong now it's our servant it's under
[2:40:09] our feet we tell it what to do
[2:40:12] every time a thought comes to your mind
[2:40:13] it doesn't be
[2:40:14] there you say shut up and get out of
[2:40:16] here
[2:40:18] huh
[2:40:19] every every fear that comes your way you
[2:40:21] don't have to be afraid you don't have
[2:40:24] to be scared
[2:40:26] huh
[2:40:27] praise be to god
[2:40:30] i believe that there is a rest for the
[2:40:32] people of god don't you
[2:40:35] that no matter what comes in the witness
[2:40:37] age that we're living right now folks
[2:40:38] where we're at we need peace more than
[2:40:41] we ever needed peace we need rest in
[2:40:43] people that we have ever had rest
[2:40:46] i want every one of us
[2:40:48] completely sealed in
[2:40:51] are you with me how many wants to be
[2:40:53] completely hidden in christ
[2:41:02] let me
[2:41:03] tell you something that
[2:41:04] doesn't matter like brother man he would
[2:41:06] have a cross on his car and then when
[2:41:08] temptation goes away it has absolutely
[2:41:10] no effect on you if you turn your head
[2:41:13] amen
[2:41:14] you it serves you
[2:41:17] doesn't affect you at all
[2:41:20] no matter what it is
[2:41:22] greed
[2:41:23] lust for money
[2:41:25] huh
[2:41:28] one thing that kind of come to me and i
[2:41:29] trust is the holy spirit and that was a
[2:41:31] warning i felt to say in the name of the
[2:41:32] lord and that is a lot of times we don't
[2:41:34] have the rest that we have we don't have
[2:41:35] the peace that we have we don't we
[2:41:38] succumb to temptation simply because the
[2:41:40] cares of this world
[2:41:42] are more important to us than god and
[2:41:44] his rest
[2:41:46] huh
[2:41:48] we're too busy in the morning to pray
[2:41:49] and keep our prayer life up like paul
[2:41:51] said die daily amen and sometimes see
[2:41:53] things creep in and then we wonder why
[2:41:54] we're cold on god wonder why we're
[2:41:57] lukewarm
[2:41:58] why we ain't got no shot why we ain't
[2:42:00] got no amen
[2:42:03] but we don't see the lord in our life
[2:42:06] and this is my heart is our desire this
[2:42:08] morning and that is that you will see my
[2:42:11] heart's desire for each and every one of
[2:42:12] us that every day
[2:42:14] that you will see christ working in your
[2:42:16] life
[2:42:18] because after all how many knows he is
[2:42:21] your shepherd
[2:42:22] he watches you every day he is with you
[2:42:25] wherever you go whatever you do
[2:42:29] and i love to see him in my life
[2:42:32] changing things doing things telling me
[2:42:34] things
[2:42:36] amen
[2:42:39] oh my and when that thought came to me i
[2:42:41] said lord
[2:42:42] you know sometimes like madam says
[2:42:44] sometimes for a family or an individual
[2:42:46] when it rains it pours
[2:42:49] and then they'll go through a life of
[2:42:51] kind of peace and you know everything
[2:42:52] will run smooth for a while
[2:42:55] i mean it's with me that's the way this
[2:42:56] world was that's the way god geared it
[2:42:59] for you to have a time of rest and i
[2:43:01] don't know that don't bother me
[2:43:04] when he's in here this morning they can
[2:43:06] say i'm glad that that don't bother me
[2:43:08] anymore
[2:43:10] i'm glad i don't have a struggle with
[2:43:12] that anymore
[2:43:17] i sure but
[2:43:22] got both hands up in my foot
[2:43:24] i am glad that i don't have a struggle
[2:43:26] with that anymore and then i'm glad i
[2:43:27] don't have a struggle with that i don't
[2:43:28] have the battle anymore
[2:43:31] god gave me rest from it
[2:43:35] now
[2:43:36] it's
[2:43:37] time to celebrate it's time to have a
[2:43:40] festival
[2:43:41] and gladness
[2:43:42] and a good day
[2:43:44] i believe it's a good day for for the
[2:43:46] people of god
[2:43:47] it's shalom it's peace it's not all you
[2:43:51] better worry it's not judgment it's not
[2:43:53] condemnation for us this morning
[2:43:56] it's mercy for us
[2:43:58] it's not judgment
[2:44:00] it's forgiveness
[2:44:03] are you glad this morning
[2:44:05] oh i'm so glad
[2:44:09] now i want you to think
[2:44:11] in closing
[2:44:12] i want you to think
[2:44:16] of what you need rest from
[2:44:22] what is it that you need rest from
[2:44:28] what enemy
[2:44:29] would you like to have rest from amen
[2:44:33] because god can give it to you
[2:44:36] how many knows god can give it to you
[2:44:38] maybe you don't have any enemies you
[2:44:39] have no problems you don't even have a
[2:44:41] weak link
[2:44:44] i'm glad for you praise be to god
[2:44:48] no trial no temptation everything's good
[2:44:50] huh
[2:44:51] i don't you don't need prayer
[2:44:53] wow that's really good
[2:44:57] but we all need prayer don't we we all
[2:44:59] have something in one part of our life
[2:45:01] and that's why i say you think because
[2:45:02] you know what it is
[2:45:04] i don't but god does you do
[2:45:12] and you'd like to what the only way
[2:45:14] you'll get rest from that is what
[2:45:15] overcome
[2:45:17] you only overcome as you come to christ
[2:45:20] you'll only get risk as you get come
[2:45:22] into christ he will give you rest from
[2:45:25] that
[2:45:28] anybody that's ever went through a trial
[2:45:31] rejoices over somebody that's coming out
[2:45:33] of their trial
[2:45:35] because a lot of us had
[2:45:37] been in the
[2:45:38] tunnel
[2:45:39] it was dark
[2:45:41] complete dark tunnel
[2:45:44] amen
[2:45:46] and we looked for a light at the end of
[2:45:47] the song
[2:45:50] and prayed it wasn't a train
[2:45:54] hey amen
[2:45:57] that's right
[2:45:59] amen and eventually got up there and you
[2:46:00] realize hey here's the sunshine again
[2:46:03] don't say make songs about that the sun
[2:46:07] amen god bless you stand with me if you
[2:46:09] will
[2:46:18] lord give me complete victory over all
[2:46:21] my enemies
[2:46:22] give me rest so i don't have to fight
[2:46:24] them anymore they're gone
[2:46:26] they're history
[2:46:28] now you can rest in christ from all of
[2:46:31] your enemies
[2:46:32] jesus would have never invited us to
[2:46:34] come and rest
[2:46:36] if there wasn't a place of rest and if
[2:46:37] there was not something real
[2:46:40] for us to rest
[2:46:41] from all of yourself all of your cares
[2:46:45] that your spirit could be in
[2:46:47] complete control
[2:46:48] of the holy spirit your soul
[2:46:50] and your body
[2:46:52] in complete control of the holy spirit
[2:46:54] how many desires that raise your hand
[2:46:56] for jesus we give
[2:46:58] you our all father this morning we come
[2:47:00] to you lord saying take all of our
[2:47:02] burdens

[2:47:05] and our battles
[2:47:07] lord and help us to come into the
[2:47:09] interval
[2:47:10] in there with you lord jesus where the
[2:47:12] world is shut out and it's just us

[2:47:39] gone

[2:47:42] lives this morning those taskmasters
