to come and be with you most of all we want to invite the lord jesus again into our midst and just ask him to speak to us speak to every heart that's here tonight you know this meeting tonight would be worth it all all the efforts that's put into it everything that goes on behind the scenes would be worth it if just one soul is brought closer to christ brother branham was in chicago in the 50s and had quite a meeting there there was a brother that was in that meeting brother byler there was several hundred that came to the altar every night brother and would have an altar call and there were several hundred that would come to the altar the brother was just elated to be in such a powerful meeting and he said to brother branham at the end of the meeting brother branham i believe of all the meetings we've been in this has been one of the greatest he said why is that he said there were several hundred that came every night to the altar he stopped and he said but brother the two god sent me after came the first night isn't that incredible he'll pass over hundreds pass by thousands even millions to get down to find you amen if he's chose you and ordained you and predestinated you from the foundation world we can run but we can't hide amen i don't want to hide from him tonight i want to hide in him amen i want to be so far in christ the devil don't even know what to do with me amen how many feels that way as you're staying tonight we want to get right into the message first samuel chapter four if you have your bibles i'll do my best to be a little bit uh less time preaching tonight than i was last night you forgive me if i took too long last night i was trying to not take so long sometimes that's your fault because you pull too hard and and you keep making us preach when we're trying to stop but you just keep pulling somebody told me one time said preacher you preached too fast i said no y'all just here too slow so if you'll hear as quick as i preach we'll get them a lot faster amen first samuel chapter four i want to read verse four verse five and verse six first samuel chapter four verse 4 and so the people went to shiloh that they might bring from fence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two sons of eli hofner and phineas were there with the ark of the covenant of god and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all israel shouted with great shout so that the earth rang again and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp i'd like to bow our heads just a moment father we do thank you again this evening for your divine presence lord the wonderful specials and the songs of zion that was saying tonight that have encouraged our hearts and has prepared the ground now for your word lord your prophet said this is the most important part of any service is what we do with the word of god he also said any man humanly can take his hand and open the bible but it takes the holy ghost to make it live and father tonight we're depending upon you i'm asking you lord once again just to take us lord and put us in your hand help us to get out of the way tonight may you use our lips to speak our ears to hear our eyes to see our hearts to understand may you minister to every life and may every need that's represented among us be met because we believe tonight you're a god that can meet all of our need grant it to his father now and we'll give you praise for all things in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ and the whole church says all the young people says everybody says amen god bless you you may be seated brother byler did text me today and wanted to know where i was i think they were supposed to have some kind of game a volleyball game of the old people against the young people and i texted him back and i said brother balor i was there last night and it looked like you had so many young people that they didn't need me you understood right amen it's hard to imagine yourself but you know at one time believe this or not at one time i was y'all's age that's right i was young younger i don't think i'm old i'm getting there but i'm not quite there but i feel young in my spirit tonight i feel young in christ i believe there's eternal youth in christ our souls are eternally young amen 18 to 21 preached a funeral the other day of a man who died at 81. i told his wife in the funeral or i just spoke at the funeral said 81 years old he took his last breath and in one moment's time he went from 81 and reversed his numbers to 18. that's a wonderful promise in christ tonight i want to look tonight first samuel chapter 4 just to give you a background again of our subject israel as a nation had gone into apostasy now apostasy simply means they have forsaken the commandments of god they have forsaken god they forsook his word now you know god knew what kind of a nation israel was before he ever chose them and i'll tell you this israel never chose god god chose israel god didn't choose israel because he thought israel was greater than the other nations god don't need a nation that's great in whatever abilities or powers they got brother god can take nothing and hook himself to it make something out of it he's proved that right in this building tonight but he took israel and you know israel's like that unfaithful wife kept backsliding kept going away and kept going away but god's love just kept reaching out he'd send prophet after prophet after prophet they would come down there and speak thus saith the lord and shake israel until brother man said one place every prophet god sent he sent birth pains and he'd rock him back to his word then they would repeat the process but it got to the place that israel had went into apostasy the temple had gone bad eli the priest had gotten old and he was begin to permit things to go on in the house of god that was an abomination of god his sons excuse me for a moment we're committing lewd acts of sex inside the temple walls of god his own boys we would say tonight were his assistant pastors and the bible said they were sons of dale and and they were eli's descendants to be next priest in the tabernacle of the lord we'll tell you what happened god got angry god got angry with them because they started stealing the sacrifice and eating the meat of the sacrifices and stealing from the people of god bringing strange fire and committing lewd acts in the temple of god god decided what i read to you tonight the shout out was in the camp but god decided to send the philistines now that wasn't god's people but he decided to see send the philistines down to bring war against israel eli's two boys hofner and phineas when the philistines came to fight with israel they were so warped in their religious thinking that they thought they thought that they could continue in their apostasy as a nation that was supposed to be serving god they started serving the false gods and even though the tabernacle had now been listed as a reproach in the sight of god they felt that if they could take the ark of god even their condition to the battle filled with them and that ark represented the place of his presence the place of his word the place where his shekinah glory was they felt in spite of their sin god would give them the victory over the philistines but there's one thing that they forgot about it's one thing that many nations forget about it's one thing that many churches forget about it's one thing that many preachers forget about and it's even one thing that many lay members forget about and that is this god does not bless sin no god don't give victory over anything as long as it's living in sin i remember years ago we had the young boy that was in our church when i pastored down in florida about the age of 18 years old i started a church there in a little storefront young man came in the meeting and he just seemed like he could never get the victory my daddy was an elder in the faith and one day my daddy got to talking to him and he got to tell him my daddy i can't overcome this i can't overcome this i can't overcome this and my dad let him keep talking and finally my dad realized he said son i can tell you why you can't overcome it he said why brother gibson he said god don't deliver you from your friends he delivers you from your enemies so as long as you're making friends with those things god won't deliver you from it but you've got to get to the place that you don't love it you don't want it amen but as long as that desires there then you're going to have problems with it what we need tonight is the holy ghost to drop down and brother deliver us from the love of the things of the world i want to just kind of give you a little thought here for a moment we had a meeting one night and they say the old boy came to the order and he said preacher my god you gotta pray for me you know we used to have revivals and brother byler i hate to admit it we'd have revivals and people would get saved but be the same people god saved the last revival then we'd have another revival and people so many people get saved come to find out it was the same folk that got saved from the last revival finally one boy came up and said preacher you've got to pray for me said what's wrong son he said oh i got so many cobwebs in my spirit said i just need you to pray god clean the cobwebs so the old preacher laid hands on him and started praying the spirit of god fell on the young man he got on fire for god he went out you know and he just it kind of dwindled down after a few weeks next revival comes same evangelist come through young boy back at the altar said son want you back this time said preacher i hate them but i got cobwebs all in my spirit again i need you to pray for me again he said all right so finally the boy the preacher laid hands on the boy and he finally got so enthused in the spirit of god and he went out come back next revival same boy again preacher said my god son what's wrong he said pre-track i just got all them cobwebs pray god he said no no no we ain't praying god clean no pop webs we're gonna pray god kill the spider that's causing the cobwebs the bible said righteousness exalted a nation but sin is a reproach to any people now we can look around i won't for the sake of time i won't go through all of it but our nation's in trouble tonight we had a vindicated prophet that told us that america as a nation has rejected christ am i right said they turned down the gospel so all these people are screaming look i wouldn't care if you line me up ten thousand preachers that told you revivals coming america i would say like they said in the old testament if not there one more and then i would consult god's prophet and if all them ten thousand preachers were saying something different than that one man right there i take sides with that one man right there and he said there's no revival coming to america brother that's god vindicated man right there and he said america as a nation has turned down the gospel but see the sins of a nation can hinder a nation the sins of a church can hinder a church the sins of a family can hinder a family but only your own sin can hinder you so while the whole world is dying while the whole church world's cut off and they ought to see you while there may be members next to you dying that doesn't mean you have to die you can have a revival in your own heart amen if everybody else ain't in the spirit you can stay in the spirit it ain't nobody else praying you can still pray you can still have revival in your own heart even if there's death all around you say it can't happen then you tell me how darkness came all over the land of egypt but israel glory to god had light in her dwellings so what happened well they were shouting over the ark they would love to see the ark come into the camp and they sang and shouted so loud that the earth rang out but after that battle the philistines took control of the ark of the covenant so one of the messengers come back and they told eli the story and the bible declares him to be kind of a heavy man well not kind of he was a heavy man and when they told him the story the bible said he fell backwards and died when he heard the story of what happened not only did they tell him that the ark of the covenant was taken but both of his sons and phineas and went down in the battle in their own blood and they died on the battlefield it was more than what eli could tolerate isn't it tough isn't it tough when we sow our wild oats and then you know crop time comes and harvest time comes you know the bible said you sow the flesh you shall love the flesh reap corruption there's a lot of people that sold their wild oats and then when the harvest time comes they start praying for crop failure if you want something in the spirit then you got to sow in the spirit but their reaping time come now next standing to eli was his daughter-in-law and all of a sudden the daughter-in-law was about to give birth to a baby and when she'd heard that her husband had died on the battlefield and was killed and she saw her father-in-law fall in the chair backwards she she heard the ark of the covenant had been taken the bible said she fell to the earth when interval and gave birth to this baby when this baby come out she put a name on that baby and that baby's name was ichabod and that name ichaboc means the glory of the lord had departed from israel well that's a that's a terrible story to hear about the ark where the abiding presence is the glory of god the ark of the covenant represented god's presence god's words god shekinah god's glory and what we've seen was because of their lack of dedication there are a lot listen closely now them allowing what god had blessed them with to become common to them and the presence of god in their life and all of a sudden they begin to get loose before i ever get out my message tonight i want to tell you something you got something that's the greatest thing that's ever struck the face of the earth i know this might be a hard pill to swallow but you're following a ministry tonight that is the greatest ministry that's ever struck the face of the earth i'll go a step further our lord jesus had more success in william branham's ministry than he did his own i didn't say william branham had more success our lord jesus had more success in william brennan's ministry than he did his own that's hard for people to swallow but it's still the truth and if you understood what brother was talking about you would say amen now watch and he also had the greatest vindication of all the prophets from enoch all the way in this day am i right the greatest prophet amen a capstone prophetic ministry and here you and i said tonight by the grace of god under the auspices of that ministry of malachi 4. only i can tell you brothers sister i don't know where i would be tonight if i hadn't been for the grace of god one night down in tifton georgia preaching in a tent meeting as an 18 year old boy a man came at me tonight sitting on the front row he was dressed in all black and somebody told me he said be careful about that guy i said how come said he is one of those brandonites i didn't know what a brandonite was i said what's a brightening night so then he follows a man by the name of william branham and all he does is listen to his tapes so i preached that was probably ten preachers in that meeting that night i was just a young kid went behind the ears of all the men he could have went to he came to me and said that night said hey brother luke would you like to go home with me i said well i'm trying to you know how it is preaching now you got you got to think of an excuse quick i started trying to think of excuse i said well brother probably best that i go and talk to the preachers and see who's going to watch the tent so i went over there and talked to one of the preachers oh just go with him i said well thanks a lot y'all told me it's a brand and i told me some kind of weird dude and so we go down i follow him in my car we get off of an exit on interstate 75 there in tifton georgia and the name of the street i still love it today i go through there sometimes it's called omega boulevard i said man what a street down to hear the message of the hour omega boulevard so i got down there he lived in this little single wide trailer when i went in i knew he wasn't married ain't no woman lives in the house the way that guy had it on one wall he had nothing he didn't have cds and mp3s and all that we had tapes that's all there was was tape brown and yellow and this whole wall was plastered and i thought man this was a spiritual guy listen to a lot of tapes and i went over there and it said started in 47 48 somewhere and went and i mean there was hundreds of them william brandon william branham william brown william branham william branham william and on this wall he had nothing but pictures of this same fella brother branham it was this picture and all the other ones you could think of and i'm sitting there looking at all these preachers of what in the world and then i went over here and hit the eagles all on this wall i thought where is god's name am i at i'm in a man's house he ain't married and i can see why ain't no girl gonna be attracted that stuff a fella listen to one man's tapes you know following one man this is tape and worshiping birds i thought man this is a bird all right and what he did he said to me i invited you here because i wanted you to listen to brother bran and preach i thought well okay you know i listened to a lot of preachers i said okay he gave me brother he didn't give me one tape he gave me two part one part two both of them 90 minutes apiece and it was a message entitled the serpent seat lord jesus what a way to start it fell off at least you could have gave my key to the door something like that something just kind of you know just throw a little bit of i mean he threw the whole t-bone out there but i did always love steak and i still do people say well you know y'all not eat steak it's not healthy and they i see these people you know they're vegetarians dying like flies forget that nonsense you know i said look i don't know if y'all know this but when when melchizedek came to abraham they wasn't eating carrots and beans come on they had them a rib eye with a cold glass of milk that's good eating hey man what we got tonight is good meat this is good steak right here we got a message a full seven course meal tonight we're blessed people well i went in the room and i'll get off this quick but i went in the room put my head on the pill and he gave me it was a tape player you know young people back then you worked to hear this message you had by batteries you make sure you had electricity all that kind of stuff we got on our phones now just tremendous what god did for us but i put that tape player upon my pillow laid my head on it and listen to him for about an hour and thought is this man ever going to get to a subject and tell me what he's talking about took a long time and he was a different type preacher he didn't come out there preaching and talking tongues preaching talking tonight that's what i was used to but i'm just kind of talking along there but you know brother byler something my heart was saying that man talks in a way i've never heard a man talk before he talks like he knows what he's talking about and when he got finally got into the serpent seed and what the original sin was my old mind started fighting it because you know i wasn't taught that way but something in my heart was saying you know that's makes more sense than anything i ever heard but i had all my scriptures lined up that morning i went in there to that boy and he said what did you think i said well i have a problem with some things and i'd give him my thought and he'd counteract it and have an answer then i'd give him another way to try to defeat it he'd give me another answer now look that wasn't fair that was a man with you know 238s i mean he was loaded and i had some butter not trying to fight this message it wasn't even fair finally he just had every answer possible and you know now i realize why he's been listening these tapes this this message you know i and i and i know it will brother bowler it'll load your head up but tonight i wanted to load our hearts up i wanted to just get down in there brother cause we're blessed people i said all that to say this god brought us a long way but he's brought us the right way and i also want to say this my prayer has been for the last 30 some years god don't you ever let this message get common to me let my heart burn with this message don't ever let me lose my sincerity about what you gave me because i'm a blessed man tonight you're a blessed people tonight you young people blessed to hear this message and the thing you want to say is god don't ever let me allow this message to ever get common to my life and it can happen it can happen so much that brother battle said we can be fundamentally right and lose our sincerity until he said we do we do it out of formalism until one place he said it becomes a stake in god's nostrils that's what we want to be careful of now we realize israel had got into this backstage state the ark of god had been taken but you know it sounds like a bad picture i know chapter four it's taken but now let me tell you something about the god we serve because if i skip chapter five and i get over to chapter six i will show you that the ark of god came back to israel again let me tell you why he proves to us that god is always a god of restoration hey brother i've seen people get away from god and i've seen god restore them back you say well i think they got one shot that's why you ain't god and he is we don't have a lot of grace for people sometimes but god's grace goes further you know what it'd be good for us summer realize where we see some of y'all god kept you you say well i never did smoke i never did drink and i and i'm with you i hadn't done never done those god kept me from that thank the lord for it he kept me from but there's some people tonight if it hadn't been for the grace of god they'd be out on a bar stool somewhere somebody'd be strung out on drugs somewhere maybe some of you girls sitting on a street corner somewhere selling your body me what be you if it wasn't for the grace of god that's what keeps you from it but i've seen people get away and i've seen god bring them back you say well you're telling me god's a god of a second chance yeah he's a god of a second chance he's a god of a third chance he's a god of a fortress and if he wouldn't i sure wouldn't be here it's his grace that brought me where i'm at tonight well somebody say praise the lord restoration he's a god that can restore i talked a little bit about it at the end my message last night but he is a god that can restore and you can't even read the church ages without knowing that he's a god that can restore i will restore saith the lord he not only restored his word he restored his peoples back to his word amen now we find what happens is let me get right into my message now the fourth chapter of the ark is taken the sixth chapter the ark comes back and israel now is in the state of revival anytime the word and the presence of god comes it puts the people back in the state of the bible i got a few quotes here tonight i won't read them all for the sake of time but i'll tell you what brother bam says and we're without excuses brother bam said god and each generation gives every generation a chance out of revival and he says a chance at his word then brother bam said this and this is the one up held close to my heart brother when i understood what brother was preaching matter of fact he preached it on my birthday august the 25th and a message called one was perfect the other one it's called how can i overcome brother young people when i saw the title that sermon brother man didn't preach what can i overcome how can i overcome but if i can learn how to overcome what doesn't matter no more but brother made a statement that message he said i chose this because i think this time that we can never let the spirit of revival die we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day not just on sunday and wednesday not just in youth camps you see a lot of you young people go back to your churches you ought to be just as on fire for god at your home churches are you as you are in meetings like this you ought to worship the lord and sing and be willing to play the piano and lead the songs and do all these things you have to wait for a youth meeting you want to beat the youth that's in revival everywhere you go goddamn said paul said i thought daily that christ could live we must never let that revival listen now die within us then broadband another place explains what a revival is i'm not into the theological part of it knowing that revival is sovereign and only god considered revival but a revival is reviving what we already got now listen to me and see if god will help us tonight to understand this the problem is people are either living in chapter 4 where the word has or they have forsaken the word they have compromised in their life or you're over in chapter six same people but now they're in revival because they've allowed the word back the spirit's back the holy spirit's back the glory is back the ark's back that's the type of life we want to live in but here's where the problem is between losing the ark in chapter four and regaining the ark in chapter 5 of chapter 6 we have to come to chapter 5. listen to me chapter 4 they lose the ark chapter 6 the ark's restored but i want us to follow what happened in chapter 5 and from chapter 5 i would like to preach tonight on the subject our journey to revival our journey to revival listen to me closely wouldn't it be so wonderful tonight if every one of you you men got such a revival your wife would finally believe you're saved somebody'll catch that later wouldn't that be wonderful that everybody around you know something happened to your life you know that can happen you know i can get to the plate you don't have to tell people you're saved they'll see your life and know something happened that man the greatest sermon ever preached is one that's lived i tell our young people all the time you ought to preach a sermon every day and of necessary used words come on your life is a testimony your life is the gospel on display and when you're in revival oh how the glory of god reflects itself through your life so we see tonight you say can that happen oh yes the same holy spirit that fell in the day of pentecost is the same holy spirit among us tonight that same presence that fell down on 120 fall right in this build of the night come in like ways of the holy spirit and baptize and you say well i got the holy ghost a long time ago well you ought to get re-baptized with it again you do believe that right one birth many outpourings what i see about pentecost is not just the fact they come out of the upper room staggering like a bunch of drunks i like that i like that wouldn't that be tickling the night to see people so drunk on the spirit you know that happened a few years ago can i just take a few minutes and i'd tell you something that happened a few years ago i'm talking about i don't think zechariah may have been born yet but i about well it was just before we come up here back home i kept praying god i got a bunch of young people coming up and they never been born again they've been raised in a message but they never met the god the message help me lord how can i get them to experience finally only thing i knew was the way i used to do it used to just get by myself and i loaded my old camper up i headed up to beckley west virginia found my little campsite there got in that campsite done nothing but took water for three days i said i'm just gonna pray drink water that's why we used to do it used to fast 21 days i wish i could tell my testimony what happened with me shaved my head bald headed fasted 40 days trying to find god faster 21 days 30 days 28 days but i went for like the problem said three days is enough so i went up for three days just water prayed and asked god sending revival sending her about nothing not hearing anything nothing's going on come back down on that mountain on the third fourth morning come to charlotte north carolina driving my vehicle with a trailer behind me something not a voice out there something inside me said do you really want revival i said yes lord he said then let's start with you now listen to me and i said well what is it lord he said do you remember and he brought back and i won't call no names but he brought back something that happened i've talked about over 20 years ago 20 years ago i met an elder in this message that i know did wrong i knew he wasn't right what he did but let me tell you folks something two wrongs never make a right cause you think your brother's in wrong don't mean gives you a right to treat him wrong i was a little wet behind the ear preacher boy and i met him one night and brother when i met him i knew what he had done and i said something real smart at him i did i said something smart at him he got upset he walked off i walked up and had a fella with me that was patting me like you really done something good boy you you showed him but yeah i showed him but i'd have to answer for it later you know there's many times i got down brother sister young people i got down to pray and talk to god and it seemed like i'd get right there this present and that thing would come back up and i'd take my broom and shove it under the well i don't know how to deal with that i don't want to deal with that he deserved what i said i'm riding down the road and i said lord that man's nothing but a saul he said if he was you sure wasn't a david all right i said well lord i'll do anything if you'll sin or bother our young people baptized with the holy ghost he said then what you'll do then this is in my heart something talking to me said what you'll do then you'll call him and you'll apologize to him for what you said to him that night hey i got on the phone only person i knew was his sister i called her up i said sister this is brother so and so i'm looking for your brother's number says oh i got it she gave it to me i called him answered the phone i said brother you're probably not going to remember me oh yes he did he's trying to lighten it up you're probably not going to remember me i said well i met you out in arkansas and and one night met you and i said something to you in a short way that i should have never talked to an elder in this message i might not agree with you but i didn't have a right to talk to you that way brother thank god for grace on his end i said my name's looking so i remember you well and i said well i apologize to you the lord told me to call you and tell you i'm sorry for what i said to you that night and this brother said little brother god bless you you're forgiven don't you worry about it no more brother when he said that it was like a weight that come off of me and that bit in that truck and i just cried and wept for about an hour down the road his presence dropped in there hey you sometimes you think you hold something in your heart and you you know it's like unforgiveness toward people and unforgiveness to this one and you you know not forgiveness it's you drinking the poison hoping the other god dies come on now you're gonna see what i'm talking about just a minute because we're gonna get what it takes to get from chapter four to chapter six where the power power's lost and the power is restored you've got to come through something in chapter five and finally when he said that i got home and i started preaching on the baptism the holy ghost i started preaching the actual experience i took in acts 2 38 just preaching the promises of god and i i i lie not god's my witness and you can ask my wife and that's the different ones that's in their meetings do you know we actually had to hire get them kids and put them in vehicles and people drive them home we was there past midnight they got so some of them got so drunk on the spirit they couldn't even get to the cards we had to take them to their cars because the spirit of god got so rich to those meetings i baptized 40 some young people over that summer amen he's still the same yesterday today and forever we clean these old hearts out revival we'll come back to our churches and the power and the present god will return to our buildings let me tell you what happened here's what happened oh my in chapter five when they took the ark of the covenant it visited three cities the first city that it came to was a city called ash god the second city it came to was called gaff the third city they brought the ark to was called ekron i want to preach to you for a little bit but god's help on the journey to revival the city of ashdod the philistines you know they might have been powerful but they were pretty stupid they were pretty dumb people and i'll tell you why they took the ark of god when they got it and in the city of ashdod was where the temple of dagon was and they took the ark of god and dagon was the philistine god and they took the ark of god into the temple of dagon well let me just tell you something god's word and god's presence don't belong next to idols [Music] so dagon let me tell you what he was he was a stone god a stone god let me tell you what it was he fit real good in this day he was half man and half fish we've never lived in a day i saw half and half sometimes i'm embarrassed i don't know if i'm supposed to say yes sir yes ma'am half and half they say all these pronouns him and he and she and i said let's just settle it we'll just call them shims i read the other day but the mandate for the vaccine i said well no i said i'm trans vaccinated what's trans-vaccinated i said today i identify as vaccinated so you have to accept it come on now i don't mean to be funny but i was in a walmart park like my grandson and they said boy i gotta go to bathroom pop i gotta go to the bathroom i said son get out next to that tree right there he said pablo i can't do that i'm at walmart i said no today you identify as a dog well y'all still with me say amen some of y'all might as well laugh and enjoy it you know it's funny your religion just won't let you laugh about that but it's funny i don't care what you say now this stone god had man have fish was the god of fertility that's what they believed in their philosophy the biggest temple was there and asked god it was the temple of dagon now they took the ark of god can you imagine they take the ark of god they walk it in there and they set it right on the platform next to their idols when they send up there got that ark put it up on the pillar got their god put up on that pillar and the priest thought that's a perfect spot for israel's god and their god what happened well i'll tell you what happened the next morning the priest woke up nobody had visited the temple nobody else had been down there but the holy ghost that accompanies the ark of god was in there and when the priest walked in that temple guess what they found out somebody knocked their god off of their stool so guess what the priest did if i could use this for an example the priest had to go over there and when they found their idol it was laying on the platform can you imagine that morning the priest had to go over there watch this and pick up their god and put him back on his stool i want you to think about that just for a minute because i'd hate to have a god that i had to pack around the god we serve we don't have to pack him around he packs us around come on church that was an idol they had to pick their god up moving around and set him back up on his idol you know what happened the next day the priests go back in there and all of a sudden they find out that their god is back on the ground but this time his head's off his palms are off his hands are off and there's a little nub laying on the floor now all of a sudden dagon is not just a god fertility he's a handicapped god and i'm going to tell y'all something our gods are made short he's still got power to save his ear ain't deaf he can still hear he sure ain't dumb he can still speak he can still move by his power amen he's not limited we're limited but he ain't limited we serve an unlimited god tonight with unlimited resources i'll tell you what happened god wasn't satisfied i hope you can get read between the lines now god said my word and my presence is not going to sit next to idols let me tell you what ashdod means it means the city of cleansing isn't that credible the ark had to come through the city of cleansing what that says to us is god shares his glory with nobody they were bringing god in and erected him in competition to fake idols and god himself not nobody else god himself knocked their idols over what's that say to us tonight i'll tell you what it is he's either god of everything or he's god of nothing sometimes we live in this country and i don't want to just get in all of it but i'll just tell you this i'm gonna set in the simplest terms i can tonight anything that gives you more joy than serving christ can become an idol to your life i was what a deacon the black brother in my church used to be the song leader he i told this story all over the world he knows it so it doesn't bother him not tell it but when i first come there he's a black brother now black folks don't sing out of their nose they sing from their hearts something happened this guy i got in the back room i said man what happened to you he said what you mean i said if you hung around these white people so much they stole your soul from you i said you sing like you come out of a baptist church [Music] y'all sing song like down at the cross see man that ain't how you sing you sing down the cross with some feeling to it down at the cross where my brother he said that's just the way we sing it around here i said oh he said you know by the way but look i'm just not an emotional man well i knew better than that he had five children so he had some kind of emotion listen to me we'll get into something finally one day i saw him out in the parking lot he had his door open and he had some music playing and it was the music that he liked some of that old black gospel and i'm seeing that they're doing like this i said oh there's that soul it's back so he invited me to go down to watch a game at clemson university now i'm not a clemson fan don't care about them they're of the devil i don't have nothing to do with them i lived in south carolina they perverted two of my boys got them liking that crazy clemson team some say who do you like i said anybody playing clemson well anyways we went down the basketball game now remember i'm with the guy that's not emotional he's sitting i'm sitting here my wife's sitting there his wife's there he's there and my wife went out really we went out and brought orange and purple and got in the spirit of the game you know i didn't pack my bible to the basketball game it's ridiculous people take spoken word books at a baseball game then you're there to enjoy a baseball game lay the book down come on you get in the spirit of what you do right well if you get the spirit of balkan you can spirit the house of god so we were sitting there and clemson was down and one of them boys got the ball you know he was dribbling down the court got that in a man he booked a jump and he dunked that ball you know brother rudy over there son this guy ain't emotional my wife can tell you he come off the floor about that high whoa i said oh man you're in trouble now he said what is it i said you told me you wasn't emotional about like i talked about my boy last night i said if you could do that at a football basketball game over a pit something made out of leather how much more you ought to be able to shout and praise god over salvation amen that was paid by the blood of the lord jesus christ come on i know what i'm talking about but you see [Applause] when you allow an idol to rob god of the priority of being first in your life it becomes an idol to you to be honest with you some things are not sin they just are weights that can weigh us down from selling out and giving god our all amen brother baptism said he remembers preaching the raw heathens he said with any of them raw he the raw heathens now we're all heathens once gave their life to the lord jesus brother said the first thing they did was took their idols and thrown them down you know why because that spirit got in and behold these ghosts got in them they knew there wasn't no room for this idol and the holy ghost at the same time so they threw their idols down wouldn't it be good tonight if a cleansing power would come to this building and every young person say hey ain't nothing my life taken the place of the holy ghost i've opened up giving god full right and i throw down everything that's an idol to the holy spirit we've got to the place in america we make sports stars a bunch of fornicating adultery money-loving sex symbols we made idols out of them until they were around their names on the back of their i told my boys and they know it none of them i said you can like sports but you ain't never wearing the names of them men around on your shirts you ain't advertising for them i've seen young girls i'm not trying to be mean they may be listening tonight i'm just telling the facts i told my daughter you ain't hanging sports stars in your bedroom you ain't doing it i got a girl i know i'm not trying to be mean to y'all god bear bear me witness but i preach what the prophet said now okay if it hair lips the devil you can take it to hell and back understand what that prophet says right there i ain't backing up for it but i told this white girl she wanted to hang some black man up in her in her bedroom a sports star what long that spirit came in and she ended up committing fornication having babies out of wedlock by black men producing a lot of children and property god preached against it you don't play with them spirits you get your heart set on christ i don't care what nobody tells you you believe what that prophet said you get the holy ghost and you it'll pluck the way every word of god with an amen now you're going to get quiet on it but it's still right we we've took and made god you know get like brother william here god's gifted you the gift the sin you've got a tremendous ability to sing that's a wonderful gift to have god bless you you young people sister playing piano god's gift to you that's that's wonderful but you always want to keep that gift in control of the holy spirit because the world tried to take that and take it and pervert it i've seen young little innocent kids i'm talking about 12-year-old kids that could sing like angels and they put them on american idol god gifted them i believe all them gifts come from god right that's an elvis's gift came from god but he sorted out he said he sold it out like judah students sold out for 30 pieces of silver elba sold out for 30 cadillacs sent souls to hell nothing said i know his mother i know his pastor and he said he's a young man with a holy baptist with the holy ghost and then turned around and said he's a devil standing in shoe leather but took that gift that god gave him and used it wrong and guess what happens they make it today elvis presley's still an idol that's right they took 12 year old girl i've seen a beautiful little girl couldn't sing like you wouldn't believe innocent come out there with a little dress on look just like a pretty little girl i thought man what a little girl do you know she's about 17 18 a day got her hair shaved on one side all purple got earrings hanging off dressed weird you see what the devil done you see what that crowd will do to you turn around made an idol out of her and then took a gift that she could have blessed god's people with and turn around sold it out for wealth and popularity and money and destroyed her life god gets offended at idols that we allow to come and until we allow permit the holy ghost to come glory and knock those idols down and chop them up break them up and to storm out our lives it's then when that happens that the holy ghost comes in and your light becomes overflowing with the spirit of god wouldn't it be good as the old psalm says i'm so full my cup so full it's running over and i have to drink from the saucer i'm so filled and i believe every man and woman every boy during the night can be so filled the spirit of god that your life can be overflowing with this presence [Music] the city of cleansing city of cleansing let me go on because i gotta go quick i gotta bypass a few things here tonight but we live in a pleasure stricken age it's the truth i know it is you know they're gone they're gone god you remember samson you know what the prophet said about him remember where a secret of his power laid and compared to secretary's power and he compared it to the church and its condition and then his head finally laid down in the lap of the delilah had one problem attracted to beautiful women end up selling this gift out told the secrets power you know what happened the spirit of god departed brother i couldn't think tonight of anything worse than to have the spirit of god depart from us honestly i don't want to go today now i know i get to the place where the word of god so anchored in this even when i don't feel god i believe in many ways because i don't live my life by feeling but it's you're going to feel god ain't it you're going to feel something in your heart i it's all i believe get all over us filled with our hands feeling our feet that's what makes us dance and shout but sometimes it ain't that way and you just got to anger back god said it i believe it even if i don't feel it i still believe it what happened to samson lost his power can i tell you where they brought him to brought him down to the temple of dagon where the temple of god used to anoint a man and put that brother man said you know you get this picture they go no man said small man let the spirit of god did on him glory look what he did take a job on that just kill thousands with a jaw because the spirit of god what happened i swear to god to get on you you surrender like samson did let the spirit of god you could put devils to flight well i'm just a weak christian brother luke i'm just nobody yeah but brother ben said the weakest christian when they go their needs in prayer demons troubles devils tremble when you go to prayer but we need brother bother we need some good old-fashioned prayer meetings again i told our young people back home a matter of fact here in the next week or so i'm getting all of our young men together coming back to the church on a friday night i said we're just going to come together start praying hey that's that you know what you realize that's our weapon against this covered stuff all these sicknesses prayer cast out devils with prayer in the name of jesus but i believe that i told you last night god can heal a legion don't you think he can put his protecting angels around us tonight sicknesses you say oh this is something what you gonna do if this ain't a problem no i can't say but what we're gonna do when the prophet says when they start striking the land brother church but i don't know how to pray you better believe god well the doctors what about when the doctors don't have the answer i'm not against them but what about when they don't have the answer i tell you still who still has it dr jesus still has it i'm so happy when all that mass stuff was going on i was so happy when my church finally went back down to the road to demask us you know that's where saul met him was on the road to damascus my church finally went back to the road of damascus and we all d-masked just started believing god trusting god i said my god you're afraid how many were you going to exercise mark 16 you only want to touch each other huh y'all still believe mark 16. i'll still believe we lay hands on the sick and they recover y'all still believe in the power of god you still believe in the presence of god still leaving the glory of god you're gonna take your natural cardinal intellectual mind and reason in a way but what we need is cleansed cleanse them unbelief prayers from all these ideals of reasoning come back and let the power of the prayer to god come back in the church where we see the glory of god you know what he did when the temple day god oh lord once more it's in your power and it came you know god told saul one day to kill all amber kites remember that i mean you know how many left alive [Music] little cute little baby that's right read the bible look alive look cute little baby let me tell you something little babies blow up and little idols that you let in your life they get bigger god told saul said kill all hamikai don't leave one of them alive he got down and felt sorry for one you know we got a little pet idol the one the holy spirit says now kick it out check it out he's talking about kick a television now lord you know i gotta have that i'll just change the name i won't call it how about i just call it monitor oh now i got to get on now i'm i'm i'm meddling now ain't no i'm gonna tell you something some of these telephones are a hundred times worse what a television is i've warned my young men all the time my own sons don't get your problems in your bedroom and let your mind go free with that telephone it taken places you wish you never went tell your young men something you know joseph remember him went down there and that woman got after him i always said this joseph lost his coat but he never lost his character run he run from it when you see things trying to keep in run back to calvary run back to christ oh i can beat it no you can't you've got to have the help of the holy ghost you've got to have god cleanse you through and through of the idol that would try to erect itself and fight against the presence of god i got to go i got to hurry but i'll just say this samuel saul died in 1st samuel 31 you know what killed him a descendant of the seed he left alive that's right i'll tell you something when god tells you to rid something you'll either rid it or it'll rid you you'll either kill the flesh or the flesh will kill you and find he took the head of saul this is crazy but they took the head of saul they took it down there and they hung it in the temple of dakota brother you can't play with flesh it'll destroy you i'm gonna tell you something else i i i hold this in my heart i hold it there i'll tell you why you can live your life for god your whole life everybody knows you you've been to church you go you pray you're at the revivals preacher calls the altar call you're down there spirit of god when they watch you surrender the lord and you know you come down the end of your journey and you fail god you make some of the greatest mistakes people will never remember what you did throughout life they'll only remember how you ended life so i said if we gonna finish let's finish strong hey when i check out this world i told my boys got six of them i said when y'all come in with my daughter and y'all come around my bed i don't want y'all coming and praying crying over me i want me to take my hands put them up on you and bless you as i'm checking out of this world hey you don't have to feel sorry for me i'm going where i preached about i talked about there's a body waiting on me hallelujah that's the way we got to believe it there's nothing this world compares what we have in christ all right let me move on cleansing we got to come through cleansing we got to be cleaned out i'm hurrying give me ten more minutes listen next place in chapter five they came to the ark came to it left ashdod and came to the city of gath the city of geth is amazing it's not cleansing now but it means the city of crushing so god not only brought it through the cleansing but it's got to come to the crushing and listen to this and death is where you find the city of the winepress you go down to the wine press and the wine press is where they put the grapes in there and they stop the grapes and they crush it when they stopped it it brought forth grape juice and then ultimately brought forth wine which was a type of joy stimulation or i could preach for hours on this stuff here's my question you might be willing to be cleansed but you will tonight to be crushed are you willing to god take you down there and crush you crush your life where he can break you down so much and he can crush you until the something's pressed out of you that's greater than you and the presence of god has pressed out you as i said last night it's not raw wheat but god makes bread out of you where you not only can be blessed by what god does for you but others can have that that blessing can overflow and others can be blessed by your life what is it well i'll ask you this way are you willing to be hurt that others might be helped think about a spirit-filled living is a life where self is not involved what you have inside might be life but it goes out you've got it coming in the watch if you've got it coming in but ain't nothing going out what happens to it becomes stagnated like the prophet said a sister a broken sister huh brother batman said that day at calvary what must we do well the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself he his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life eternal life is living for others do you know where brother branham said jesus finally you said oh he did it at calvary no no brother madam said he defeated him at the garden of gethsemane gethsemane there means oil press brother adam said satan's eating jesus fought it out was saved in the garden of gethsemane he won back the eden which he's going to prepare in heaven to return again when he was there he prayed listen the only place the bible ever said he sweated only place a scripture he's out in boats nothing ever talks about a sweat until he's being pressed if you trace it back go back to the garden of eden sweat was a sign of the curse when the sweater thou browed he told adam you bring forth sweat was a symbol of the curse you can imagine when he was down there and guarding yosemite prayed until his sweat you can see the demon say oh i knew i knew he had to curse on it i knew he wasn't who they say was but all of a sudden they looked and they noticed that his sweat became as great drops of blood he sweated out and great drops of blood you know god was saying he's not cursed god was telling the world this is my son he's not a sinner he's my son he came to save sinners say yeah but that's jesus no that's what them said said he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to traditions and things to reveal another dying denomination to reveal him to others so not only do i want to be cleansed i want god to crush me whatever it takes lord whatever it takes for my life to be so you whatever you've got to put me through that others can see christ here i am lord i'm willing lord whatever it takes to produce that spirit of revival in me here i am lord let me give you one more city because it came to a third city the third city came to was called ekron ashdod come from ashdon gath and then came to ekron ekron was not cleansing it was not crushing it means the city of commitment so god not only cleanses us he not only crushes us but he wants to see commitment out of us now listen to me closely equiron literally means immigration or torn up by the roots what's that what's that saying to us well i'll tell you what it is god wants to cleanse you he wants to crush you but in the crushing he wants to pull everything out of you let's not like him and what we do when i was a boy about nine ten years old let me have your attention just for a couple more minutes about 10 years old i had a cousin his name was yoki real name was timothy you can look him up he's been in prison for 20 some years time he was 18 he's well longer than that 18 he went in but he got out for about a couple years and then went back he lived most of his life in prison he was my close relation when i gave my heart to the lord at 13 we kind of started parting ways he became a thief he stole when i was with him and i say brother you still not really but i was just as guilty because i enjoyed what he stole you know what i mean i'm just i'm just guilty the only thing was i had a daddy at home was about six one weighed about 260 pounds there wasn't a fear of god that kept me from stealing it was the fear of charles gibson because remember last night i had a momma that seemed that she knowed everything i'd done and i figured she found out we were stealing then guess what i had to deal with daddy that's a big man when he used to whip me brother i used to run around him like this and he gets so angry he gets stand still and i'd hear him say son i wouldn't do this if i didn't love you and there's a boy i'd say well daddy hate me a while oh it made him so mad one time when he said as much as it hurt you i said daddy i don't believe that give me that belt and then we'll see if it hurts you as much as it hurts me boy i got a double whooping that night he laid me over the bed he put his leg over my legs like that boom boy he wore me you know every time he whooped me he told me he said your brains are born right down in this area he said the more i whip you the further the brains go up and the smarter you get he was right he was right because it seemed like he didn't take a whole lot of whoopings from him to smart me up i'd have fear of him and i did and it was a it was a good fear not a fear my dad was loving man but it was a good fear it was a good fear that kept me from a lot of stuff but anyway me and my cousin we had about 12 or 13 lawns you know we cut grass that's what we did i love cutting i still cut grass today because my boys are too lazy to do it i cut grass and it's one thing i enjoy because i can do it and look back and see what i accomplished i said he's not like passing a church you can't look back sometimes see what your cop takes a lot of years but i cut graphically but i did a pretty good job on that i like straight lines i like to look right one way is my cousin he's a shyster and so this old lady she's about 80 years old in florida everything's beautiful florida is all built with sidewalks i love it because you get out ride your bikes and you know now you gotta you know in the country you came right down you can't walk the streets no more because these knuckleheads driving cars staring at fools you might get hit but florida we had these sidewalks so this old lady we cut her grass she said hey boys would y'all do me a favor said yes ma'am so what would y'all charge me to pull in between the sidewalk the grass that's growing my cousin he was the money man 20 she said okay that'd be worth it well i ran home with i just lived in tree and i got one snuck in and got one of mama's butter knives and what i was going to do is take them butter knives and go in between and crack and dig until i got down and got the root well i i was doing it yogi comes hey what are you doing i said man i'm digging the roots out don't do that i said well i didn't know no different he said don't just take it and cut right off you can't see the grass i said well she's paying us to get rid of she said he said no if you dig the route up we won't get paid next year he was right because if i got the root that would have been no more problem he didn't want me to get the root he was he was smooth man he felt a little different what i thought and i said well all right i did what he said i didn't get you know what we had that job again then we had that job again and we had that job again because i wasn't getting the root so what god does look we got to get down there he's got to not just cut them things off he's got to get down in the end and root them things out of us hey if there's unforgiveness you got to get rooted out if somebody's offended and you're feeling toward them you've got to get it rooted out you've got to let the holy ghost come down take that thing out of you hey brother i'll just tell you what brother branham said and i and i cannot tell you i've always been there i had a guy one time come to our church brother before you meet with people have a good old-fashioned prayer meeting because you don't know what spirit that rascal's coming in i had a prayer meeting i had to meet with this guy he had a problem with my church so finally we met i just prayed and i prayed for him and he come in there and he said i like your drums i don't like your guitars your music's of the devil he just started telling me now everything's wrong brother my heart was just so happy i shook his hand said well god bless you brother i love you anyway i quit the church i said i still love you you know this day i still love you because brother branham said you ought to be able to bitterly brother tell what you say people ain't there he said but you ought to be able to bitterly disagree with a man and still love him just the same i could stop right there tonight this order could fill up with every one of them so saying lord i don't know if i'm there but if i'm not reach in there and root that thing out of me when i when i have deadly disagreements maybe i don't like the way somebody does something i don't like what they said you know hey you got to have tough skin to go to message church but there's people there are i believe in a six-fold ministry right you got the five-fold and there's always one more fold in the church that's going to prove whether people got the holy ghost or not they're the ones that just rub you the wrong way and sometimes i'm almost done i got to go i know sometimes it's the irritation like the old yeah y'all ever studied the pearl how it's formed the oyster that grain of sand gets an irritates it you know you know how that happens your sister and your brother irritate you i mean did it seem like you're ordained to god to irritate some people just predestinated to be a thorn in the flesh huh y'all thinking of somebody right now it just seemed like god sent him to be troubled but you know what that irritation causes that oyster to shoot out a solution it goes around that irritation and that irritation is forming a pearl and in you tonight there's a pearl being formed in you god let certain things happen if you'll surrender the holy spirit that solution that down on the inside like that dove just cleaned you keep forming you but you got to let god do it i wish i had more time to go this these roots you can read that but about the root of bitterness you can read about it but told us in the in the in the uh in the word to the church christ the mystery god revealed he tells it there he tells us even how god wants to do exceedingly abundantly he speaks about it he said but what we got to do is prepare our hearts break up the ground get all the grub out and the green briars and the stickers and the thorns and the roots of business and bring down the holy spirit so that the anger of god might sweep over this building in a great meeting say well that's back there no that's right here tonight that same angel that vindicate that ministry is the same angel that still accompanies this message that same holy spirit that would fall over the audience is the same holy spirit that fought over this audience you give me a people that'll sell out let god bring you through the cleansing let god bring you to the crushing let god be that place of commitment where you'll sell out and say lord take out of everything everything out of me like i said when when god gave a man the holy spirit he set his face toward calvary and the word before him little roots rise up from off the that highway come up wrap around that tree and you think it's very easy but first thing you know they get a hold of you until it pulls you the wrong way it makes you lean the wrong way on this tonight but the man said if you really want god come to your heart make you sweet make you meek and humble and gentle you want that dub to come back he flew off a little piece from you you know when you got mad you dropped to atlanta go through atlanta today come through nashville and we come to uh chattanooga but you realize you've got to have the holy ghost to make it through there and keep a sweet spirit there's people waving to us seems like he's missing four fingers this is the friendliest place i've ever seen but they all got one finger people are crazy somebody david gavin come the other day coming through the line and says where are you it says satan's eden he told says you must be in atlanta i said i'm in atlanta man this place is crazier than a bed bug it cuts off you know you know how it goes little trucker cuts in front of you you get mad you're gonna show him you'll get beside him and slow him down to irritate him well he didn't wonderful how beautiful christ is in your life or does that only happen to me don't happen all you sweet folk out here brother man said he wants to come back the holy spirit wants to come back he sure does he said would you raise your hand and say god remember me god bless you that's wonderful just dozens of hands everywhere sure methodist baptist lutherans pentecostals nazarene fully holding what about message folk what about you nazarenes how you used to be so sweet but you all got different you got roots of bitterness something happened listen but i don't want this i don't i want it out i want everything out of my life that wouldn't be pleasing to him i want to get to play you don't see me all you see is him i want to be the type of man you say but sure nice to be in the atmosphere of that preacher that brother he sure god it's good to be around him you feel the spirit of christ when you're around him what happened to you pentecostals that used to be sweet too but what happened to you glory to god hallelujah got it but you found out made you act different your fruits tells what you are now look what the church has done it's either got off on a bunch of fanaticism or that went real starchy and stiff and take none of it but brother there's a mill the road where the true gospel is preached and true bible signs and wonders follow the sweet holy spirit leads that church that's the kind of church to go to an intellectual church with a full gospel sermon real spirit of god and the spirit everything is decent everything in order everything in love that's the kind of church we want not people to come in won't speak to nobody won't shake nobody's hands you know how husband wives are you fuss all the way to church soon you pull in the parking lot oh god bless you so good to see you and you put on this face and then you can't wait to church at home you get back in the car started backing your fuss all the way home isn't that just wonderful how god is mommy wants to be sweet i'm talking about the sweetness of the holy spirit you want that in your life only just for a minute let god bring us think about it let him bring us to each one of those places and then you find yourself as i said in closing you find yourself with paul saying i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ that liveth in me and the life i now live in the flesh i live of faith the revelation of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me then you'll find after it came to them three cities the ark was restored back to the children of israel and the shout of the king was in the camp i don't care what nobody tells you you don't have to wait for a revival to have revival the preacher don't have to come and un open this briefcase and revival pops out we can be in revival like when they back in england you remember they come and ask the policeman where's the welsh revival he didn't point down to some church down the road he didn't point to the building he said you're looking at it i am the wealth revival brother i'm going to say it like this in closing if there's a revival to follow my type force ministry you're it you're the malachi for revival you're watching this is what this is what this message produces people never pick up a message book or play a tape of brother branham's the question is tonight young people could they look at your life and you'll be a representative of the very gospel that brother branham preached and it got vindicated let's buy our heads tonight as musicians come please times away from me maybe brother william will get a little song ready here head mile just a moment i'm done but i want to ask in closing just be real honest with god real honest with the lord jesus just a moment i want you to be real honest say lord maybe i hadn't been fully surrendered maybe there is something in my life listening tonight maybe there's something that i know is hindering me from really really living in that revival spirit maybe there's something i've held against somebody that i shouldn't make it right i expect to spend eternity with them why can i live in the house of god with them you're here tonight before i turn it back to our pastor would you lift your hand tonight honestly in the presence of god god bless you young people already and say lord
