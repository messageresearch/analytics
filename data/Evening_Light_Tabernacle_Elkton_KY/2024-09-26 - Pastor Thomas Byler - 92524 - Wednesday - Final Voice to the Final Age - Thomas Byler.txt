Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus once again thankful Lord on this side of Eternity Lord Jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together Lord and to call Upon Your Name Lord Jesus to surrender oursel to you Lord so that you might use us Lord to speak the words that you once said father and father we just ask God that as we read your word father realizing Lord those are the Eternal words that you have spoken that they're alive and they just need to be in a heart that believes a Spirit-filled life Lord Jesus and we just ask God you'll Bless The Meditation of our heart father that which we feel Lord You've laid Upon Our Hearts to speak help us Lord to do it Lord that the ability that only comes from you Lord we commit this service to you now in Jesus name amen and amen amen let's just start if you will let's go to 2 Corinthians 2 Corinthians 2 Corinthians 3 and we'll begin with verse one Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us WR written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word tonight amen you can be seated amen amen I got to think about that quote brother brandom talked about and what he made when he made a comment about the bride being the final voice to the final age so I'm going to title this the final voice amen the final voice to the final age amen Paul talking of course here he's talking about you know they were talking about um needing a letter or some kind of uh Commendation about each other whatever and he did then Paul goes describing how that you know you're our epistle amen that's known and read of all men how many knows that's what we are amen we're like a book each and every one of us is like a book amen and let me just say I think the hardest person to read that book the person that it's hardest the hardest to read that book is yourself ain't that right at least that's how I found it in my life amen because it's so easy to read everybody else a that right oh this person's this way and this person's that way and so forth and so forth you know but when it comes to looking at yourself amen it takes something special amen it actually takes the Holy Ghost amen and if you're as honest with yourself as I am of to myself sometime when the Holy Ghost to really get the getting me to look in the mirror I get a little worried I get a little scared I'm like brother by you know you're this way now you might want to admit it but you are and you ought to be amen and I don't like it amen every one of us have Natures that pull you in a certain direction a that right and sometimes we don't recognize that direction and I found one thing that whenever I'm carnal whenever Thomas berer is carnal and I'm telling you you whenever you're carnal you don't only uh not only don't you really read yourself you go blind that's right most of the time when you get carnal you'll swear up and down no I'm not carnal no and and even a a spiritual uh type of blindness uh a self-justification spirit you'll promise that you've got the quote you I got the quote brother but yet in it all you'll be wrong you're wrong in your attitude you're wrong in the way you're doing it and even though there's a quote in that way it's not wasn't meant to be applied in that manner amen and down none of that was in the script so y'all it's all free but that's the truth isn't it amen and as brother Brandon Begin to say this let me just read this quote to kind of lay a foundation he says it this way and uh I got to think in the final voice to the final age but you know really I was thinking you know uh that that it is the final voice to the final age but it's a voice that's been around for a very long time so let me I'm going to I'm going to skip ahead and then go back we go to the end and then we'll pick the other up is that all right amen and now notice the people who took Wesley's Revelation from be you know that he got from God they became living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation and when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so that it had so it has gone on through the years until in the last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age amen so how many beli we're the final voice to the final age but brother B I'm talking about uh the the Church of God the people of God of course we know ever since the time amen when Christ ascended and whenever he sent his Spirit back on the day of Pentecost that the voice of God and the mouthpiece of God has been the Church of God it's been his people that's been their mouthpiece God's mouthpiece God's voice amen he says a momentary com com consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the Luther the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word of God was lost for organization Trends towers dogmas and Creeds and so forth amen and when they could no longer speak speak for God then God sent Wesley on and on and on and on so God has always spoken amen and it is quite something how that the voice of God has always been through not the moon not Sun not trees not anything but always been through his people remember one place Jesus said when you're taken up in counsels and so forth and amen don't premeditate what you're going to say because it'll be given to you what to say in the moment that it is amen and I've experienced that many of times folks you'll come up into situations and you have no idea you know how it's going to go but if you'll just surrender God God will give you the wisdom he'll give you the words to speak amen how many knows whenever you say those word it absolutely dumbfounds anybody that's coming against you amen so this thought of not only being the final voice but how many knows that they're the temple of God not the not just the voice of God but amen their minds are even the mind of Christ even in their minds even our minds the Bible says yeah that we ought to have the mind of Christ let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen so again tonight we want to focus on the holy spirit in the church the holy spirit in his people amen doing what Christ does in St John 14:12 a very familiar scriptures tonight verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whosoever when whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and if she he shall ask anything in my name I will do it and if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may be abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you how many's glad that he came to us he's not just with us but he's in us until the very last age and not not just the last age but the end of the last age and here we are think about it look around here we are the final Runners how many believes we're the final Runners final voice you're the only Jesus you're the only Bible that people will read then a lot of people will read how many knows that makes gives us an awesome responsibility it if you are Christ in flesh and the people only see are they only going to see Jesus in you amen praise the Lord now I've got I want to tie some other thoughts in here with it it'll go along with this but I had a few more thoughts that I want to kind of try tie in with the help of the Lord amen and the next scripture is in Romans amen and this morning when I woke up I had all these thoughts flooding in so I just got one of these little things here and I got the back of it so once I write it down I don't want rewrite it but I hope we can make sense of it amen final voice Romans let's go to Romans 8 Romans 8 in verse 19 it says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope down to verse 22 for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but we ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body how many knows brother Brandon preached a lot of message on adoption he had the adoption series many times brother Brandon would talk about how that he had under he was under expectation for the children of God to come to the place of adop Amen to where when they speak their word would be backed up amen let me tell you tell me my brother my sister he says when when there was ever a time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there is ever time in history he says that this was to be manifest the time to deliver all nature even nature itself groaning waiting for the manifestation amen for the sons of God to manifest themselves listen he says and he goes to talking about the Old Testament all the way down through here he says but now all things has been brought coming shaping up into a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it'll join him and the church together now how many know we've had it we've got the word we've had a perfectly Vindicated a message brother brandom that was so much like Christ amen there was I don't believe there was ever a man closer that reflected Christ more than the prophet of God that came to the place that God could say you speak you say you speak you say it and what ever you say that's what it'll be see tonight we want to talk about that where we're going isin that right how many wants to progress in your Christian walk I mean we ain't staying in the same place as we were Sunday not the same place as last week or last year or last month no we're going somewhere we're coming closer and closer amen as Christ comes closer and the time of his appearing gets closer so we here are get closer also and if we've had a Ministry and a message amen that was so much like him amen I going to say this when are we going to eat the book so to speak and become the book and when are we going to see this manifested in a greater way because I don't know about you but I sure love to see a little bit more of it yes sir not that everybody's called to do great great great things but I'm here to tell you you should be able to hear the voice of God every day in your life for your situations amen I got to hurry but I'm not going to hurry so here we go amen all right shaping up oh my notice the coming of the Lord Jesus is so close at hand un till the spirit from way down in there from justification from sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and right now into that time of the coming of The Headstone the church has got to be so perfect perfectly like Christ until Christ and the church can unite together amen The Same Spirit and if the spirit of Christ is in you it makes you live the life of Christ amen act the Life of Christ do the works of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also we got a Ministry coming that's just exactly like the Life of Christ what does that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord I mean no Pentecostals were up there pretty close but he was still not all the way no they had the restoration of the gifts and so forth but now it was back to the fullness of the word fullness of the word in other words Jesus come down and did exactly what he used to do when he was here on the earth unquestionable that to me that never gets old what Jesus came and did that wasn't we're not talking about what brother brandom did we're talking about what Christ did through brother brandom amen because that was Christ through brother brandom amen oh my all right we'll just we'll just go on here okay now brother Braham says the coming of the Lord look at look at the world today and watch what Kush Chef's saying and all these other great things the great worldwide conflicts right at hand at any time could go to powder at any second notice and if that we know that it's that close any sensible person can read the newspapers or listen to the radio and know that it's close can you imagine him saying that back there how much more it fits today you can look at the radio you can hear it and you can know that it's close amen by listen just looking around amen remember Christ comes for his church before that happens so how close is the coming of the Lord maybe before this meeting ends amen we're at the end time praise be to God Amen now listen let me just let me let me I want to talk to you a little bit about when when uh when omnipotence meets omnipotence and so forth but let's go down here with this talk again and a little just be in place where where God can use us in such a way to speak his word amen cuz I've been out out on the farm I'll tell you what it's as we all know that we've been in a drought things have been drier out there than I've ever seen it I mean you talk about dry I've been having to feed cows Here Am me in middle of September and I usually don't like to do that till December or so you know and and I'm like boy oh boy this is really drying and I got to thinking about what the how that the prophet of God he uh he said you know a lot of times he said he'd lay hands on one another don't pray for yourself because the Bible said pray one for the other and it's it's the Life of Christ to pray for somebody else amen and I got to thinking about what brother bam said about how that the the Believers there's coming a time should come a time when we come to the place of adoption so that when we speak God backs it up ain't that right now listen everything everything's all of nature The Whole World's groaning everything's moving what for for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons I like that born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is back I believe we're on the border of it now yes sir say to this mountain and it'll be so brother I desire so and so a certain thing done a believer in Christ I give it to you in the name of the Jesus Christ there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning up out yender I haven't gotten any rain I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord you know how many times I stood out there and said I fixing to call I'm fixing to call somebody hey I need y'all to pray for some rain out here will you CU what prophet of God said you know if a brother somebody needs some rain somebody say I give you rain in the name of the Lord amen I believe in another place and I was looking for it he says you know come a time when the sons of God they'll if you will not need a limb restored they'll restore Limbs and so forth goow it back amen even more I'll listen that's right oh my bless your crop oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man a domain amen praise the Lord amen that's right remember what Jesus said verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I sh shall you do also and greater than these shall he do because I go unto my father Amen in Mark 11 and verse 22 if you remember the story of the Fig Tree drying up by its roots in verse I'm sorry I it's in St Mark 11 St Mark 11 11 verse 22 and Jesus answer saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore say I unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you rece receive them and you shall have them how many believes that's true amen amen John 14 no that's not the one I'm looking for it's Matthew 17 Matthew 17 and we'll begin with verse 20 I believe it is let's go to 19 because we remember they were trying to rebuke a devil and cast them out out of the child and so forth but couldn't and then Jesus in verse 19 of chapter 17 then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if ye have faith as the grain of mustard seed he shall say to this mountain remove hence and and Y to a y place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you how be it this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting now the point that I wanted to bring out was he says nothing shall be impossible unto you how many beli all things are possible the song We sang I think before coming up all things are possible is that right all things are possible to them that believe amen let's talk about deity speaking how many believe brother Bram said that whenever a ministers under the anointing back there when he comes out five-fold ministry under the anointing is The Voice of God speaking the same as deity speaking it's God speaking to folks amen now notice he says now he says we know that no man could move no mountain by just speaking to it he says the only thing could do that would be deity amen so then if that mountain is before us and our objective is right our motive is right then it isn't us speaking anymore it's deity speaking then it has to move amen and listen to what he says I truly believe that the church this was in 58 the church is on the brink of one of the greatest outpourings that it's ever had in any age amen now notice I'm going to move on down through here again now notice now if he is the Living Word if he is the Living Word then his this wrote here on the Bible is part of him then if you can receive this this into him if you can receive it into yourself which is the word this word comes into you by faith and makes it live how many believe that if the word comes into you if the holy spirit's in there now if you don't have the Holy Spirit you're not even any of his but you need that spirit in there brother Bram trying to say here you have the Holy Ghost and now you receive the word in there is't that right every promise is true therefore you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart because what you are deity speaking the Bible said so amen and whatever you say shall come to pass if you don't doubt he says if you can get all of the world bread out of you let the Holy Spirit M make you in into a full son or daughter of God no world no condemnation no doubt wasn't that a condition of anything is possible if you can be believe if doubt is completely gone then you are absolutely in a position to ask anything nothing is impossible for you are you ready oh my that's right nothing is impossible what is it then it's no more you it's God in you then you take his word it's a promise say father it's your promise amen something's got to move amen there it is he is spirit and he is life not that is just exactly what the word is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart placs it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking mountains has to go Satan cannot stand before that how many like that final voice to the final age amen but so much I I just want to say so much more we're so much more than just our lips being used by God how many believe that amen we'll get get into that now notice once again this is going back a little make see see off the subject but you it'll tie in he was talking about Napoleon having conquered at all at 33 conquering pretty much the world but there was another young man that came into the world one time and he died at 33 and he conquered everything that could be conquered when he was on Earth he conquered passion Pride he conquered sickness he conquered Devils when he died he conquered death he rose up conquered hell he went in and conquered everything that was against mankind amen the great wine press God crushed it down and conquered death hell the grave sickness formalities everything else and overcome it all and Rose on the third day conquered all the atmospheres above and cut that mist between God and man and connected Heaven and Earth together or should we say connected God and man together how many knows the greatest honor and the greatest privilege we have is to have Jesus Christ to have God on the inside of our hearts the great comforter and all the Mist and all the Spooks all the hail mares and the all of these bead pushing and all of this Hocus Pocus and praying to whatever all of this stuff all the superstitions isn't that right he scattered all the Superstition especially in our age when he came in the evening light came through the through Malachi 4 is that right and it scattered all super superstitions and questions and it even even the Superstition of that you're going to burn eternally in hell if that ain't scary I don't know what it is to think when you go to hell there'll be never an end to it yes there will we found out there was we never knew that down through history amen the Amish they keep you Amish with that threat and with that scare but if you ever leave the AL you'll bur burn forever you'll burn for eternally well I sure don't want that better better stay right here huh all the sup all the he conquered all of that I no this what he does he cut every obstacle from the human beings that they might be connected like they were in the garden of Aiden amen oh I was going to choke on it listen to this I was going to choke on it but I'm going to say it that man is omnipotent all right well maybe that's some kind of yeah that's right yeah the little one out of the mouth of babes praise be to God how many glad that's something to shout about right there amen man is omnipotent what is that all powerful nothing n nothing big big big word shall be impossible for you that don't put a little youth in you I don't know what will I think about it nothing omnipotent that's what he said man is omnipotent all powerful why because you're connected to the all powerful you have the omnicient omn omnipotence right on the inside just inside of this little old skin hair right there in that little old fleshly heart right in the middle of that Soul God dwells and if you could cut all the way all the doubt on all of this other Christ lives in there we fixing to get to the good part amen hallelujah that's right man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man that's fully surrendered to God God is omnipotent didn't mark 11:22 say whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass if you believe what you've said what happens then when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together through omnipotence something's going to shake W Glory can I preach listen how many knows that when God came in and amen there's a faith that dropped down into sham when them two met 600 Philistines found themselves dead they woke up [Laughter] dead that's right they woke up on the other side and said that chamar got me amen when God and man comes together when omnipotence and Faith am man that truly surrendered to God like Moses was amen it doesn't matter one man against the a whole Egyptian Army something happens when those two omnipotents meet when you meet a man that surrendered to God has the faith of God in his heart when God comes down there and tells him to do something and there's nothing going to stand in his way how many believes we as children of God if we are in the line of duty amen and you've got God there is nothing that can stand in your way there's not enough little hairy imps that can come flying out of hell Amen to try to stop you we've all had a bunch of them on our backs we've all had we know I know what it's like Amen to feel like you've got hundreds on top of you you're down here oh my I know what that's like it's just get off of me in the name of the Lord hello maybe you never have I hope you never get to that place but if you are God's child you have faith there's not enough Devils to stop you you're omnipotent all powerful that's right sometimes you just feel like giving up or you feel like Bo you can't go on anymore you don't know how you're going to go on anymore and you're just covered up feel like you're up there or there and then all of a sudden got will give you a new burst of energy and you come rise up out of [Applause] there when two omnipotents meet the Devils go to getting flung off they get to go to Flying amen I like that listen it's something's got to shake that's right oh my listen whatsoever you say with that creative power of the omnipotence God he says knowing that he's promised that he said it's in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and bring things to pass amen things that are not it makes them though as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he strands oh my think about it what about Paul how many knows that Paul he was he was one of God's children he had omnipotence in him God come down amen and he was preaching I thought the other night brother brother Tommy we might just have all night meeting we could have probably done it you could have went another two hours and I could have went for three huh oh my that's right but we just don't have it anymore already I thought about you know uh you make a you know You' made an alar call like that back in the 1940s and 50s and you'd had that you'd had you'd had 30 40 people probably lined up to that trough back then even Billy uh Billy no no Billy Andrews remember he he'd come up through there and have have meetings up in russeville and all those areas and everywhere and they had all kinds of people but the Bible says that people's hearts would waxs cold people have cold Hearts folks I'm a pastor and I'll tell you what if Tommy he he didn't really make get the offer but somebody said would somebody want to just get closer to the Lord and and you know give to God complete heart you know tonight when I come up and then nobody goes I I don't know I I I want to get up there and I want to say yeah I do I want to close your walk I I'm not going to I take the opport miss the opportunity to get closer to the Lord if the opportunity is given it ain't a sign of weakness or that you're sinful or this that or the other hello it's a sign that you love the Lord and my you want more of God quickly to respond a soft heart how many need need hearts of Flesh not hearts of stone people's hearts have gotten stony one other place brother BR mentioned about America it's just been preached over until the people just sit and stare and and they become completely numb to the gospel because they heard it so much and they've been burnt so much and everything else until people just sit around and days so to speak let not get that way isn't that right amen oh my but we hum believe that the voice of God is still in the land today amen my all right that's right everything about not just the mouthpiece but every aspect of our hearts should be controlled by the Holy Spirit because Paul said it's not me that liveth anymore but it's Christ that lives in me soul see Christ Living in individual with that Soul surrendered Christ speaks through the lips he thinks through the mind he sees Through The Eyes he acts through the temperament hallelujah how many believe that our emotions are to be controlled by the Holy Ghost our feelings are supposed to be controlled our temperament is supposed to be controlled by the Holy Ghost the way that you act the way that you do tars people amen they should be able to see what has that person God he acts like a real Christian is that a heart's desire Lord help me to be a perfect reflection when people see you they see Jesus amen listen to this I liked it that's right you see through your eyes act through your temperament Hallelujah and the things of the world has passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time Christ has got control amen that's right it's Christ in you the great mystery how many believes out Christ the mystery of Christ in you that's the hope of glory it's a mystery to the world you know you know I probably shouted loud enough Tommy probably shouted loud enough for to go be heard two or three blocks up there hello but did you know that we weren't very loud preachers there was other preachers that were louder than us brother Tommy up there there was other people that was louder as far as I'm concerned preaching than what we were that's right what brother Bram say lived sermons you know for anybody to believe anything we say Tommy all they had to do was turn our head all they had to do is turn their heads and look at our wives look at the women amen you wearing long hair and having dresses on and the way that you did that spoke louder than anything we said I truly believe it was it it it was louder than anything because actions speak louder than words and if our wives would have been in pants and short hair and makeup and dressed like a bunch of prostitutes there ain't nobody would have believed our word maybe they would have but we as Believers wouldn't believe when somebody else talks and their wives look like that isn't that the truth we sure wouldn't hear nothing why because it speaks loud a li a life lived is so much louder than screaming or whatever it might be when women dress the way they're supposed to they say wow them really Christians amen all they had to do is look at how the were sisters are dressed amen it says everything it says more than we can ever say amen I thought it was good that's right you said well I believe the truth brother bam that's right it's in here it has to come here he says your whole makeup is Christ your attitude amen how many knows our attitude is Christ now let me just say this for the next 15 minutes if I can or a few minutes maybe not even that long but there's so many different aspects to Jesus all right because brother brandom talked about how that you know you know whenever you talk about love and when you talk about uh you know being kind cuz we know that Christ there's nobody is kind there's no other friend as kind as Jesus is as sweet and as gentle as Jesus is but brother bam talk preached about the kind old priest remember how he test whenever Jesus to plated some ropes and got mad and had his righteous indignation up and played at everybody he says well my kind old priest came and helped us when we were SI amen when we needed money he did this and here this guy comes all rambun and throws everything up what kind of a love does he have what kind of a man is this amen see there's a there's a Jesus where he says you know uh you know with the woman caught in the very Act of adultery he says you know he that is without sin cast the first stone and they all left and he says you know uh he says where's our accusers she says they're gone I don't have any he says neither do I condemn thee how what what sweeter words could you have as that neither do I condemned he just go and sin no more and on the other hand amen when Jesus speaks to Sinners he speaks in a certain way he speaks with Mercy even brother B said don't condemn The Sinner for sinner for sinning don't blame him for smoking his pipe and drinking his beer and doing all of that that's his pleasure that's the only pleasure he knows but live a life so that he can see that what you have is a million times more but when Jesus goes to talk to the Hypocrites and those who reject him he calls him a bunch of you bunch of you're your father the devil you serpents you snakes and boy he just gets all over him there's a different aspects of Jesus he speaks to The Sinner he speaks to the backslider he talks to the Hypocrites he talks to the Pharisees amen when you say repent every one of you amen you know that's actually God that's warning to people need to repent or perish it's actually speaking love to them amen so how many knows that sometimes you have to keep the balance on everything he says you know whenever he was dumb he opened not his mouth when they were accusing him of all those false accusations and all the things that he did he was a sheep to the slaughter and most of the time when somebody says something or does something to you you're supposed to turn the other cheek but you know when he came up to Simon's house and Simon never invited him and never and never he invited him but didn't welcome in all these other things and he said I've got something to say to you there are certain times when you want to when it's time to talk I mean please when you're living in a chrisan life you want Jesus to be able to say now let that Holy Spirit tell you when to talk and when to keep your mouth shut it takes Divine deity rulership in your heart for you to know what to do when to do what to say when to say it depends on who you're talking to and what you're talking about amen how many believes it takes wisdom it takes the wisdom of the holy spirit in our heart to operate for us to be able to govern this thing the way it is supposed to amen because if we don't if we don't then we're just about we bring such a reproach on it know no worse than if our women were dressed like prostitutes it brings a reproach on Christ when we act carnal when we're supposed to be Christians and we act in a way that we shouldn't act that's why it takes a lot of prayer brother Sean a lot of prayer and everything say God lead me help me help me do do this right here help me to speak to the sinner in the voice that he would speak to him in because brother Braham said he speaks to The Sinner in your voice in the voice that he would speak to him in he speaks to the prostitute in the voice that he would speak to them in he thinks through your mind the very thoughts and he speaks to your heart amen and the Very way that he would if he was here on Earth amen now I had to think the pope claims this position the pope claims that he is here instead of the Son of God in other words he is here acting as the Son of God no his church is here acting the Son of God and living the Son of God not just acting but living it how many beliefs God is speaking through us God is living through us he is thinking through us how many say God I have some improvement to do I need some I I have some growing no matter how spiritual you are right about now you got to realize amen cuz said whatever you would ask and he listened to this I when you've got that life when you've got this kind of life on the inside of you brother then then this kind of deity let me just see if I can say it the way that I've got it wrote down Amen Let me live in such a position with God that God moves in you to speak to your situations how many knows brother brandom live so close to God but hardly ever never hardly that I know of did Brother Bram ever do anything just in himself he always waited for God to tell him because even Jesus said I do nothing until my father shows me first now I believe that's the secret that's the secret between you failing in what you ask and receiving what you ask because a lot of times we ask according to to his flesh or in ourselves but I'm here to tell you that if ever God tells you to say something amen then you say it you believe it because remember butam he didn't just say well now I don't like this storm I want the storm to go away never did a voice said speak to it first whatever you say it'll be even the young couple he was saying man don't act like that don't act like that God said tell them whatever just say whatever you want to them and it'll be folks I know without one little bitty of Doubt not even one shadow of a doubt that he could have spoken him out of existence cuz see God don't tell you something and then you say something and he not back it up no God would have backed him up just just as that uh Elisha I believe it was you know that had got that temper about them kids and cursed them brother BR said he really shouldn't have done that that was his carnal nature that was his own self that was not a reflection of Christ but because he said it God honored it amen on so we have to make sure that it's God speaking through US believing through US amen people come to brother bandam they' say just pronounce healing on my child and it'll be done and and I believe it it'll be done how many remembers him him talking about that and brother Ram says I can't do that I can't do that why because if it's not him saying and then don't happen then your confidence is going to certainly be shattered is't that right I can't say it until God tells me to say it that's right because she might have believed it I don't know if it had happened or not I don't know the woman claimed or the person claimed it would have been done but bad things would have happened if it wouldn't have been false prophet ain't that right he said it was well and it wasn't boy wouldn't that be a real trick of the devil that's right to bring a reproach on the prophet but he was wise enough to say no I can't do it I won't do it until he tells me let me seek the Lord on it how many believ that's the way we need to live because I believe that we're coming brothers and sisters I want evening light Tabernacle I want all of us to come higher come to that place of adoption where God can trust amen trust us enough to give us that word amen somebody does this wrong we won't speaking out of exist them or curse them and everything else amen but say the right thing what would the prophet do he said says I forgive you for that I forgive you for that he didn't want to send them to hell no because God is in a merciful god I wonder how they acted after that brother Tommy I don't think he ever said how they acted were they convicted that the Holy Ghost come down and such a way until they were just you know cuz you know the Holy Ghost can make a person just bring on such conviction until they can follow on their knees that's the kind of things that God can do especially when Hade right remember I heard kittens kids over there cutting up and carrying on weren't they he says I want my children he says you have them and them folks got under conviction comeing to left and what did they do come and fall on Mama's lap because he says if if if if God don't bring whatever you ask in your lap I'm a false prophet amen aren't we longing for that brother the for brother Joe brother John aren't we longing for that that we can do those type of things Lord and he talked about that pressure that's coming down and he say you watch he I have a brother Bram said I have a feeling that it's going to happen you know just before the end it's there's going to be an outpouring like never before how many looking we're looking for great things to happen amen we've got the word we've got the god we've got the spirit we've got the truth and if you are in the condition the only thing perhaps that we like is get in that condition get all the world out get all the doubt out get all the condemnation out walk with God every day tomorrow walk with God as a real genuine son and daughter of God Amen and listen to God speak to your heart amen God bless you stand with me if you will the final voice the final age the final life amen the last people living the life of Christ into a for a dying a in a perishing world how many believes that our love we ought to have the kind of love that Jesus had for Sinners for people that that you have and when uh and then it doesn't matter what it is you know when it comes to a correction how many knows love is corrective and that's what you know love is doesn't just let you keep going down the wrong path amen and and go off and then no it warns you it comes after you it gets a little hard sometimes kids know how hard real love gets it hurts sometimes but it's love amen God bless you tonight Amen brother uh let's just bow our heads and have a word of prayer how many desires to be in that condition where God can speak to your heart and live through you and so that others your neighbors your friends friends your relatives those who you work around they'll say you're just I'll tell you you're just such a nice person you're not that you're always sweet and kind but you'll tell me the truth when I need you'll help me and and they just see Christ in you how many just want to say God I want I want everybody around me to be able to see the reflection of Jesus Christ I'm an open book people read us we are a written epistle known and read of all men Lord and we want God that writing to be in red we want to be have all red letters so to speak in our lives where it's always you speaking always you acting in our temperament in our attitude in our action in our emotions in our thoughts in our minds and everything we do let it always be Christ and keep us out of it Lord keep us dead and you alive so that we can say like Paul said it's not me that liveth but it's Christ which live liveth in me that's our heart's desire and we raise our hand and say Lord help us to be that way in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you amen you know the Bible says that if by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you love one another amen how many beli we ought to tell each other we love each other sometimes amen so I want to tell everybody amen I love you with the love of the Lord amen you love one another amen God bless you richly Amen brother Joshua God bless make me more like thee Jesus make me more like [Applause] thee and give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee oh make me more like the Jesus make me more like [Applause] [Music] and give me a heart that's filled with love and make me
