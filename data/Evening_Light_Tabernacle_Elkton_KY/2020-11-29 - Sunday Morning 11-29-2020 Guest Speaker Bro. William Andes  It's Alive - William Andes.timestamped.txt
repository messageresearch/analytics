[4:07] not
[4:07] in the counsel of the ungodly nor
[4:10] standeth in the way of sinners
[4:12] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[4:21] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[4:24] the rivers of
[4:25] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[4:27] his season
[4:28] his leaf also shall not wither and
[4:31] whatsoever he doeth
[4:32] shall prosper
[4:41] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[4:43] the judgment
[4:44] nor sinners in the congregation of the
[4:47] righteous

[44:14] verses 22 through 26. i appreciate

[44:20] speak this morning
[44:22] and impart the words of life in this day
[44:26] i appreciate a man who's stood the test

[44:31] a man who's been through the storms and

[44:44] john 11 22-26
[44:49] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[44:51] wilt ask of god
[44:53] god will give it thee jesus saith unto
[44:56] her
[44:56] thy brother shall rise again and martha
[44:59] said unto him
[45:00] i know that he shall rise again in the
[45:02] resurrection at the last day
[45:04] jesus said unto her i am the
[45:05] resurrection and the life
[45:07] he that believeth in me though he were
[45:09] dead yet shall he live
[45:11] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[45:14] shall never die
[45:15] believeth thou this go to john 1
[45:18] 1. simple verse john 1
[45:22] 1.
[45:29] in the beginning was the word and the
[45:30] word was with god
[45:32] and the word was god go to romans 6
[45:36] verses 5 through 13 romans 6 5-13
[45:48] for if we have been planted together in
[45:50] the likeness of his death we shall be
[45:52] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[45:54] knowing this that our old man is
[45:56] crucified with him that the body of sin
[45:58] might be destroyed that henceforth
[46:00] we should not serve sin for he that is
[46:03] dead is freed from sin
[46:04] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[46:07] that we shall also live with him
[46:09] knowing that christ being raised from
[46:11] the dead dieth no more
[46:13] death hath no more dominion over him
[46:16] for in that he died he died unto sin
[46:19] once
[46:19] but in that he liveth he liveth unto god
[46:24] likewise reckon he also yourselves to be
[46:26] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god
[46:29] through jesus christ our lord
[46:31] let not sin therefore reign in your
[46:33] mortal body that you should obey it in
[46:35] the lust thereof
[46:36] neither yield you your members as
[46:38] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[46:40] but yield yourselves unto god as those
[46:43] that are alive from the dead
[46:45] and your members as instruments of
[46:47] righteousness
[46:48] unto god amen may the lord add his
[46:51] blessing to the reading of the word
[46:53] let's pray before we're seated here this
[46:56] morning
[46:58] lord jesus it's good to be in your house
[47:00] lord it's good to feel your presence
[47:02] father it's good to see so many friends
[47:05] lord people
[47:06] that we've grown up with lord friends
[47:08] that have made a lasting impact
[47:10] on our lives lord and it's good to be
[47:12] gathered together lord no doubt i
[47:13] believe this
[47:14] meeting was ordained before the
[47:16] foundation of the world father
[47:18] if there be one here that needs to hear
[47:20] this message for salvation lord i pray
[47:22] that
[47:23] the message would come and do what you
[47:25] have intended it to be this morning lord
[47:27] jesus
[47:28] if there be someone who needs to draw
[47:30] closer to you father i just pray that
[47:32] you would come in your own special way
[47:34] i pray if there's someone who needs
[47:35] encouragement this morning father lord
[47:38] in a dark age when covet is on the
[47:40] rampant
[47:40] and politics and corruption in this
[47:43] nation lord but there's a people who are
[47:45] called by thy name
[47:46] father i pray that you administer to
[47:48] your children this morning fathers
[47:50] we're constantly hearing negativity lord
[47:52] but there's a positive gospel of the
[47:54] holy ghost here this morning
[47:56] that can encourage us father minister to
[47:58] your people we pray we love you lord
[48:00] jesus
[48:01] minister to us lord and bless each
[48:02] servant lord each deacon and
[48:04] brother tom and sister donna and
[48:06] everyone in this congregation that are
[48:08] fighting to uphold your kingdom in this
[48:10] last day
[48:11] bless them and be with us this morning
[48:12] we pray in your precious holy name the
[48:15] name of the lord jesus christ
[48:17] amen amen you can be seated this morning
[48:22] keep your bibles close this morning
[48:23] there's a couple places that
[48:25] we want to go in the scriptures now if
[48:27] you go to
[48:28] romans chapter 6 and you read verse 11
[48:31] romans chapter 6 verse 11 it says like
[48:35] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[48:37] dead indeed unto sin
[48:39] but alive unto god through jesus christ
[48:42] our lord and as brother branham
[48:45] instructed us that there is only one sin
[48:48] and that's unbelief against the word of
[48:50] god
[48:51] and to be dead to sin is dead to
[48:55] unbelief
[48:55] in the word of god as john 1 1 says in
[48:58] the beginning was the word the word was
[48:59] with god and the word was
[49:01] god so we are dead to anything that
[49:03] would cause us to doubt
[49:05] the word of god in this day and
[49:08] i i'm a hunter i love to hunt and i know
[49:11] brother tom got a nice buck this year in
[49:13] austin and those of you who got nice
[49:14] deer this year
[49:16] and as hunters will do just about
[49:19] anything to get the big buck as long as
[49:21] it's legal and ethical
[49:22] we'll do just about anything to get the
[49:24] big buck and i i'm more of a public land
[49:27] hunter so
[49:28] i like to hunt public land and there's
[49:30] thousands and thousands of acres to go
[49:32] out and
[49:32] and hike and i'll canoe
[49:36] back for a mile or two and i'll hike
[49:38] back and if you can quad for
[49:40] four-wheeler back
[49:40] four-wheeler back but you're searching
[49:42] for a deer there's a final destination
[49:44] in mind there's a final end point
[49:46] there's a final goal of while you're
[49:48] while you're out there hunting
[49:50] and what we look about today is i was
[49:52] out here recently
[49:53] uh this last week and i was canoeing in
[49:57] this creek and
[49:59] i was canoeing and as i was canoeing i
[50:01] realized right when i put the canoe in
[50:02] that there was
[50:03] a lot of water in this creek and the
[50:05] creek had risen
[50:07] so much that i was canoeing against a
[50:10] stream that was not just a stream
[50:12] anymore but a river
[50:13] that was flowing downstream so i began
[50:16] to just
[50:17] kind of wait on the lord i knew i had to
[50:19] preach this weekend and i began to see
[50:21] logs and i began to see debris that were
[50:23] flowing down the stream
[50:25] and as i began to see the debris go down
[50:27] i said what makes me
[50:28] different than all the debris that's
[50:30] flowing downstream
[50:32] and i realized the reason that i was
[50:34] going upstream was because there was a
[50:36] life inside of me inside of me and a
[50:38] desire to go
[50:39] upstream instead of flowing downstream
[50:42] with all the debris that was going down
[50:44] the river
[50:45] and as experienced hunters i'm not quite
[50:48] to brother byler's level yet
[50:50] but he's killed some nice bucks and if
[50:52] you go in his house you can see brother
[50:54] tom's trophies but
[50:55] as experienced hunters you're you're
[50:57] searching for a trophy
[50:59] you're searching for the one deer that
[51:01] you took all of your time and effort and
[51:03] energy
[51:03] in that year to get the one trophy
[51:06] and as i said before we'll do just about
[51:09] anything to get that
[51:10] and i began to think about this type of
[51:13] the canoe is a type of our lives
[51:17] in lady osea and how lady osea is
[51:19] constantly pushing all of
[51:21] the muck and the mire and the debris
[51:24] downstream
[51:24] and we're here fighting fighting against
[51:27] the current that's pushing downstream
[51:30] in this last day and we can even see
[51:33] with our fight and our desire to keep
[51:35] our families and go to the house of the
[51:37] lord and continue to keep a fight in the
[51:39] revival in our lives that
[51:41] it's not the same that it used to be in
[51:43] azusa street in 1909 when
[51:45] the holy spirit came down in 1906 and
[51:47] the holy spirit came down and brought
[51:49] such a revival to the united states and
[51:51] we realized then that it wasn't hard
[51:53] like it is today and they weren't
[51:55] fighting the battles that were fighting
[51:56] today but the lord came down
[51:58] and brought such a revival to our nation
[52:00] in the early 1900s
[52:02] and we saw even in los angeles
[52:04] california is i believe the lord is
[52:06] bringing judgment to los
[52:07] angeles because of the rejection of the
[52:09] word of god that was even in that area
[52:12] and we saw the supernatural blessings
[52:14] and even the people didn't have to push
[52:16] even too hard to get into the realms of
[52:19] the supernatural in the 1900s as god was
[52:22] pushing
[52:23] such a revival across our land and we
[52:26] looked even in the 1900s as the the
[52:28] group i don't know if you
[52:29] remember brother tom the young
[52:30] evangelist so the youth for christ it
[52:32] was a big
[52:33] push and a movement used for christ in
[52:36] our day and it involved billy graham and
[52:37] even in brother branham's meeting such a
[52:39] a revival around the power of god the
[52:42] pentecostal blessing the holy spirit
[52:44] moving
[52:45] in the churches in the early 1900s and i
[52:48] like to type the spiritual back to the
[52:50] natural
[52:50] and me being a hunter i see i look at
[52:53] national numbers and
[52:55] and people are are hunting much less
[52:57] than what they used to the
[52:58] the national numbers for hunters is
[53:00] declining dramatically and it's probably
[53:02] due to
[53:03] uh people just getting on their phones
[53:05] maybe instagram facebook and other
[53:07] things have taken the time
[53:08] of getting a gun and going out and
[53:10] hunting in the wilderness somewhere
[53:12] so we look at desire for hunting is
[53:15] beginning to
[53:16] to fall and decline and decline and it's
[53:18] been a consistent graph
[53:20] showing the the lack of desire and i
[53:23] think about
[53:24] even that in our lives as we see our
[53:26] nation and the lack of desire for the
[53:28] things of the supernatural we see the
[53:29] lack of desire
[53:31] for god to really do something in a
[53:33] people's life people aren't hungering
[53:35] and thirsting
[53:35] for god like they used to and as brother
[53:38] branham talked many times about being
[53:40] rich and increased with
[53:42] goods but not truly having a thirst and
[53:44] a hunger for what truly will satisfy
[53:46] what we're searching for
[53:48] in this life and as i compare today
[53:52] even thousands of people and brother
[53:54] branham's they would gather to hear and
[53:56] if you would try and get thousands of
[53:57] people together to hear the gospel it
[54:00] would almost have to be a rock concert
[54:02] or it would have to be
[54:03] a potluck or it'd have to be something
[54:05] of natural desire to get thousands of
[54:08] people together
[54:09] to to get them around christ and we we
[54:12] see how times have changed
[54:14] and even in this canoe trip that i was
[54:17] on
[54:18] it it brought me as brother branham did
[54:20] dramas many many times so
[54:22] i want to bring you into this drama here
[54:24] this morning
[54:25] and let's go on an elk hunt together
[54:29] so i don't know if any of y'all have elk
[54:31] hunted or thought about elk hunting
[54:33] that's something i've always wanted to
[54:34] do
[54:35] and let's imagine that we're way back in
[54:37] the day we don't have
[54:38] motors we don't have uh big sailboats we
[54:41] don't have
[54:42] big boats to travel the seas with a
[54:44] motor but we just have
[54:47] paddles and we have a canoe and
[54:50] where we're at it's a very mountainous
[54:52] terrain there's mountains on each side
[54:54] of the river
[54:54] and there's been a forest fire that's
[54:56] come through typing to our day there's
[54:58] been a fire come through
[55:00] that has burnt off all the vegetation
[55:01] that has burnt off all the life
[55:03] that is around us currently and now
[55:06] we're in a river
[55:07] and we're headed somewhere and we know
[55:09] that if we get to our final destination
[55:11] we know there'll be elk there
[55:13] we know that there'll be food there'll
[55:14] be sustenance there'll be something to
[55:16] keep us alive when we get there and
[55:18] we'll have
[55:19] eternal blessings let's say when we get
[55:21] to the final destination
[55:23] and as we see everything around us that
[55:26] is burnt that is completely lifeless
[55:29] around us it types even to our day as
[55:32] there was a fire that was lit in lady
[55:34] osea to burn out anything that was
[55:36] called god
[55:37] anything that someone even recently uh
[55:39] they're trying to take
[55:40] a pledge of allegiance they're trying to
[55:42] take god out of our pledge of allegiance
[55:44] to the flag
[55:44] and they're trying to burn out anything
[55:46] that's called god
[55:48] in our society now we we see here maybe
[55:51] you've got your family
[55:52] and you've got your wife and you've got
[55:54] your kids and you're all in this canoe
[55:56] together
[55:56] and you're all canoeing together and
[55:58] it's all harmonious everything's working
[56:01] on the same team
[56:02] and and let's say we're into mile one
[56:04] and we know that
[56:05] hallelujah we're gonna get to the elk
[56:07] camp and we're gonna be fine and we're
[56:09] gonna have sustenance
[56:10] and it's my one and everyone's on the
[56:12] same page we're all fighting we're all
[56:14] struggling because
[56:15] we want to get there and we all have an
[56:17] enthusiasm because we know
[56:18] that the master told us if we can get to
[56:21] our final destination
[56:22] then we'll have sustenance and we'll
[56:24] have life we'll have blessings forever
[56:27] now as we see even those around us is
[56:31] let's imagine all of our friends as we
[56:32] think about 20 30 years ago all of our
[56:35] friends that were alongside with us and
[56:37] we were all going together and you have
[56:39] all your friends around you that are
[56:40] canoeing towards the same place and
[56:42] we're going towards the out camp we're
[56:44] all headed down the river to the same
[56:46] place
[56:47] and about mile five you begin to realize
[56:50] that
[56:51] we're going upstream and this isn't just
[56:53] easy cheesecake anymore
[56:55] and we look around us and we see even
[56:59] some of the people that we thought were
[57:01] super strong and we're the best and
[57:02] we're the most enthused
[57:04] we begin to realize that they're
[57:05] starting to wane and
[57:07] in the times when you get weak in the
[57:09] times when
[57:10] you can't you feel like you can't really
[57:12] make it any longer there's
[57:14] there's little pull-off areas and
[57:16] there's little times when you can get
[57:17] alone and you can get sustenance and
[57:19] there's little places maybe
[57:20] you find uh some squirrels or you find
[57:23] some rabbits
[57:24] and there's places that you can pull off
[57:26] and we can type that even to going to
[57:28] church on a wednesday night or a sunday
[57:30] morning or a sunday night
[57:31] and as the bible says in acts 3 19 when
[57:34] the times of refreshing shall come
[57:36] from the presence of the lord and we
[57:38] have a time of refreshing this morning
[57:40] that we can pull up to the table and
[57:41] that
[57:42] we can refresh in this long arduous
[57:44] journey that we're going to reach heaven
[57:46] on the other shore and along the trip
[57:49] we can find that there's many side
[57:51] tracks there's maybe
[57:53] some beaver dams that really interest us
[57:55] and there's
[57:56] maybe some white tail deer on the side
[57:58] of the river and it begins to distract
[58:00] us
[58:01] from our true final purpose and our
[58:03] final goal
[58:04] of where our head it where we're headed
[58:06] maybe we find maybe a little
[58:08] tree stand or a little bungalow on the
[58:10] side of the river
[58:12] and it begins to deter us from the final
[58:15] goal of why we're here
[58:16] and why we've been rowing for all these
[58:19] miles to get to our final destination
[58:22] and when we started the trip we had all
[58:25] our friends around us
[58:26] everyone around us was ready to go and
[58:28] gung-ho and we were excited about the
[58:30] final destination
[58:32] but as we think about miles and miles
[58:35] the friends begin to say that their
[58:37] shoulders are sore
[58:38] and they begin to complain and they
[58:40] begin to say that this is too much
[58:42] and this is much more than what i
[58:44] expected and i didn't expect to
[58:46] fight this hard in this battle of where
[58:49] we're headed
[58:50] and they begin to complain and and soon
[58:52] you begin to see
[58:53] after all of these miles that their
[58:55] craft begins to turn
[58:57] and it's not headed the same direction
[58:59] that you're headed any longer but they
[59:00] begin to turn and go back
[59:02] downstream from the intended purpose of
[59:05] where they were going in the first place
[59:07] and you see there's an enthusiasm that
[59:09] used to be there in their hearts
[59:10] but it's not there anymore and they're
[59:12] beginning to go with the stream and as
[59:14] lady osea
[59:15] as the stream begins to push them down
[59:17] they're just turning
[59:18] into and letting ladies push them back
[59:20] and push them downstream
[59:22] away from their intended destination
[59:25] now here we are
[59:28] in the ends in sight and we know that
[59:30] there may just be
[59:31] one more corner and one more turn and
[59:34] we'll be at the destination we'll be in
[59:36] glory land
[59:37] we'll be in that place that we're all
[59:39] been fighting for for all these years
[59:41] and it may just be one more turn and you
[59:42] try and tell that to your friends that
[59:44] have gone with you and
[59:45] you trying to tell them oh it's just
[59:47] maybe one more turn in the road but
[59:49] they say i can't do this anymore i'm
[59:51] done i have to go i can't fight this
[59:53] fight
[59:53] that i used to fight even months ago or
[59:56] years ago
[59:58] and we see we're still rowing sunday to
[1:00:01] thursday
[1:00:02] wednesday which our church is on
[1:00:04] thursday
[1:00:05] and we're still rowing we're constantly
[1:00:07] weekly fighting this battle we're
[1:00:08] getting from wednesday to sunday
[1:00:10] wednesday to sunday wednesday to sunday
[1:00:12] and we're fighting towards the rapture
[1:00:14] we're fighting towards
[1:00:15] the catching away of the church in this
[1:00:18] day and brother branham said in a
[1:00:19] blushing prophet he said do you realize
[1:00:22] old men when we were boys our boys has
[1:00:26] got 10 times the temptation
[1:00:28] that we had and as we begin to row it
[1:00:30] begins to rain and the river begins to
[1:00:32] grow
[1:00:33] and we realize this isn't the same river
[1:00:35] that we used to roll but it's getting
[1:00:37] harder and
[1:00:38] ladies beginning to push harder and
[1:00:40] harder against us in this
[1:00:42] day it's not when we first started out
[1:00:44] and the lord was pouring out his
[1:00:45] blessing but as the spirit begins to
[1:00:47] retract
[1:00:48] and come off the earth we begin to
[1:00:49] realize it's getting harder to go
[1:00:52] against the current in this day but in
[1:00:54] our heart you know
[1:00:55] there's got to be a reason why i'm doing
[1:00:57] this why i'm fighting lady osea
[1:00:59] why i'm not giving into the temptations
[1:01:01] of this age and why i fought for so long
[1:01:04] in this day he said sister do you
[1:01:07] realize that your daughter has
[1:01:08] 10 times the temptation you had when you
[1:01:11] was a girl
[1:01:13] and we see after all we've rode through
[1:01:16] our
[1:01:16] ups and downs and we've come too far to
[1:01:19] turn around
[1:01:20] do you believe that we've come too far
[1:01:23] to turn around
[1:01:24] we've come thus far and we fought too
[1:01:26] many bad
[1:01:28] battles to just look back now in this
[1:01:31] day
[1:01:32] as the son says there's too many sunsets
[1:01:34] lie behind the mountain and there's too
[1:01:35] many rivers
[1:01:36] my feet have walked through and i
[1:01:39] believe that this morning we've walked
[1:01:40] through too many hard battles we fought
[1:01:42] too many trials
[1:01:43] to turn back now now a young person may
[1:01:45] say i can't hold my paddle anymore
[1:01:48] my paddle's starting to get wobbly i
[1:01:50] can't i can't overcome
[1:01:52] like i used to and i'm beginning to get
[1:01:54] weak and i keep trying to do what's
[1:01:56] right but
[1:01:57] i can't seem to overcome i can't seem to
[1:02:00] do this
[1:02:00] but i say to that young person even this
[1:02:02] morning and even to a middle age or an
[1:02:05] elder person who's beginning to struggle
[1:02:07] the reason that you're struggling proves
[1:02:09] that there's something inside of you
[1:02:11] that's not like every other lady is
[1:02:13] seeing in this age
[1:02:14] the reason that you even have a desire
[1:02:16] to fight the current and the reason that
[1:02:18] you're struggling is because there's a
[1:02:19] fight and a desire inside of you
[1:02:21] to overcome lady osea and not become
[1:02:24] just a wash somewhere down the stream or
[1:02:26] go over the fountain
[1:02:27] of the waterfall that's going to crush
[1:02:29] your family but there's something inside
[1:02:31] of you and you're struggling you say i'm
[1:02:33] fighting and i can't overcome this
[1:02:35] but in your heart you know that there's
[1:02:37] a desire to overcome
[1:02:39] whatever you're struggling in this day
[1:02:42] as first peter 3
[1:02:43] 9 says the lord is not slack concerning
[1:02:46] his promise
[1:02:47] as some men count slackness but is
[1:02:49] long-suffering to us we're not willing
[1:02:52] that
[1:02:52] any should perish but that all should
[1:02:55] come
[1:02:56] to repentance and i say this morning god
[1:02:59] cares about you this morning
[1:03:00] god cares about your trials god cares
[1:03:02] about your struggles god cares about
[1:03:04] your desires in this day
[1:03:06] at the parable of jesus he said if god
[1:03:08] had 99
[1:03:09] sheep and one went astray god would
[1:03:12] bankrupt heaven and leave the 99 and he
[1:03:14] would go after the one
[1:03:16] sheep that had gone astray and you and
[1:03:18] your struggle and your trial this
[1:03:19] morning as you're fighting no doubt
[1:03:21] battles in ladies but god cares about
[1:03:24] you this morning and he's willing to
[1:03:25] leave
[1:03:26] all the 99 strong to come after you in
[1:03:29] your weakness this morning
[1:03:30] oh does he care yes he cares he's
[1:03:33] touched by the feelings of his people
[1:03:35] this morning
[1:03:37] now you're precious in his sight and for
[1:03:40] him to send a prophet and to open his
[1:03:42] word and to reveal his word
[1:03:44] to you it shows that he cares about a
[1:03:46] little bride in this day and he's not
[1:03:48] forgotten about you
[1:03:49] and your fight in this upstream battle
[1:03:52] in this day now we see in first
[1:03:55] corinthians 10 13
[1:03:57] there hath no temptation taken you but
[1:04:00] such as is common to man
[1:04:02] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[1:04:04] you to be tempted above that ye are able
[1:04:07] but with the temptation also make a way
[1:04:09] to escape
[1:04:10] that ye may be able to bear it now we
[1:04:14] see that god didn't
[1:04:15] come to save us in our sin but he became
[1:04:18] he came to save us from our sin
[1:04:20] so when you say someone who says they're
[1:04:22] struggling and they're struggling
[1:04:23] but there's there's no desire to truly
[1:04:26] overcome
[1:04:27] then god didn't come to save you in your
[1:04:29] sin he came to save you from your sin
[1:04:33] and you see a young person who's
[1:04:34] constantly fighting and as i said before
[1:04:36] as long as you keep coming back to the
[1:04:38] well of grace as long as you keep coming
[1:04:40] back
[1:04:41] it proves that there's something inside
[1:04:43] of you greater than lady osea
[1:04:45] but those that are not really filled
[1:04:47] with the holy spirit or aren't truly
[1:04:48] children of god
[1:04:49] will eventually stop coming back to the
[1:04:51] well of grace and eventually fall away
[1:04:53] and go by the wayside
[1:04:55] so to see that you're coming to the
[1:04:56] house of the lord that you even have a
[1:04:58] desire that god woke you up this morning
[1:05:00] to come to the house of the lord proves
[1:05:03] that there's something inside of you
[1:05:04] greater than all the deadliest lady osea
[1:05:06] in our day
[1:05:12] there's no other friend so kind is he no
[1:05:14] one else could take this in in darkness
[1:05:16] from me oh how
[1:05:17] how much he cares for you and me
[1:05:22] no one else cares for us like the lord
[1:05:24] jesus nothing else can feel that desire
[1:05:26] in your heart you can have all the money
[1:05:28] in the world you can have all the
[1:05:29] political fame you can have all the
[1:05:31] wealth
[1:05:31] but they'll still be that little small
[1:05:33] voice inside saying i want more
[1:05:36] there's something more that i'm
[1:05:37] searching for in this day
[1:05:40] and we see that though the desire for
[1:05:42] truth
[1:05:43] is dying though the desire across the
[1:05:46] nation for truth
[1:05:47] is completely dying there's still a
[1:05:49] people who have a desire to overcome in
[1:05:51] this day there's still a people
[1:05:53] who will overcome in this day we don't
[1:05:56] know the number we don't know how great
[1:05:57] we don't know how small we know it's
[1:05:59] going to be a minority but we know that
[1:06:01] there will be people
[1:06:02] and i just want to be one of those
[1:06:04] people is that your desire this morning
[1:06:06] i just want to be one of the few this
[1:06:09] morning
[1:06:10] now there's one thing about a battle as
[1:06:13] we see even in our nation and
[1:06:15] so many people rallying around different
[1:06:17] political figures and
[1:06:18] in a battle you have a general and the
[1:06:20] men are behind the general if they're
[1:06:22] going to fight hard to win the battle
[1:06:24] they rally behind the general and then
[1:06:26] naturalistically speaking when a general
[1:06:28] dies you can see the morale of the army
[1:06:31] just die with the general but ours
[1:06:35] are struggling our trials much different
[1:06:37] than a natural battle because we had a
[1:06:39] general that died
[1:06:40] but he rose again and he came back and
[1:06:43] now he's living in all of the soldiers
[1:06:45] to overcome the battle that we're
[1:06:47] fighting on a day-to-day basis
[1:06:49] so the general that we have on our side
[1:06:53] is a supernatural general much stronger
[1:06:55] than any natural general that would die
[1:06:57] and go by the wayside
[1:06:58] and his inspiration is what's keeping us
[1:07:00] and pushing us up against lady osea
[1:07:03] in this day no i've never heard of a
[1:07:06] normal natural
[1:07:07] general that died and came back to life
[1:07:09] and eternally blessed
[1:07:11] his soldiers i've never heard of a
[1:07:13] general like that i think we're serving
[1:07:15] a very unique and almighty general this
[1:07:17] morning
[1:07:19] now we weren't meant as children of god
[1:07:22] to turn
[1:07:23] back to lady osea in this day
[1:07:26] and we see what is the reward if you're
[1:07:29] going to start a business
[1:07:30] if you're going to go somewhere to work
[1:07:33] what is the reward and what are the
[1:07:34] negatives maybe a mom
[1:07:36] um you know she's raising her kids and
[1:07:38] something comes along
[1:07:40] and she maybe would want to get a job or
[1:07:42] something and she'd say well what is the
[1:07:44] reward
[1:07:44] my time with my kids are a little more
[1:07:46] money or a father
[1:07:48] he maybe would have to work 80 hours a
[1:07:50] week what is the reward if i never see
[1:07:52] my family if i never spend time with my
[1:07:53] family
[1:07:54] what is the reward and we look at the
[1:07:55] reward for lady osea we see a lady osea
[1:07:58] that is dying
[1:07:58] that is going to die that is going to
[1:08:00] hell why would i go
[1:08:02] and conform to lady osea when i could
[1:08:04] get out of here in just a shoot a few
[1:08:06] short days
[1:08:07] and i could be raptured off the earth
[1:08:09] why would i stay here and conform to
[1:08:11] ladies and when i can get out of here
[1:08:13] in just a few moments of time now
[1:08:16] as we fight the current battle we see
[1:08:18] that there's dead things that will come
[1:08:20] and try and hit you in the battle as
[1:08:23] you're rolling upstream as
[1:08:24] debris will come and try and hit your
[1:08:26] craft and potentially even try and get
[1:08:28] inside your craft
[1:08:30] and we see that maybe for men as some
[1:08:32] men
[1:08:33] no doubt struggle and for men maybe it's
[1:08:36] it's pornography
[1:08:37] and the devil would come and hit your
[1:08:39] craft and try and
[1:08:40] capsize your craft or maybe it's money
[1:08:43] maybe a family's just so
[1:08:44] money oriented or a husband so money
[1:08:47] oriented and he stresses for money money
[1:08:49] money
[1:08:49] or maybe it's popularity where we want
[1:08:51] to be better than the joneses
[1:08:53] and all of this debris is coming in
[1:08:54] ladies to try and hit your craft
[1:08:57] to knock your craft off to turn you over
[1:09:00] from your original purpose and say it's
[1:09:01] not worth it i'm going to go back
[1:09:03] downstream now daily
[1:09:07] these dead things will hit you as paul
[1:09:08] said i die daily
[1:09:10] daily these things are going to come so
[1:09:12] don't expect tomorrow to be
[1:09:14] all roses and wonderful and lovely but
[1:09:16] daily satan's going to come against you
[1:09:18] and fight you
[1:09:19] but know that greater is he that is in
[1:09:21] you than all the stream and all the
[1:09:23] power of lady oc that would come
[1:09:26] and push against your craft in this day
[1:09:28] and we see even our nation at the core
[1:09:30] is gone his politics are corrupt as no
[1:09:33] doubt many people were looking to
[1:09:35] certain leaders to lead us into a
[1:09:37] revolution a republican revolution
[1:09:39] a democratic revolution and we see that
[1:09:42] honeycombed in all this is just
[1:09:44] corruption and filth in the society that
[1:09:47] we live in
[1:09:48] today it's even in the the dnc the
[1:09:50] democratic national convention they two
[1:09:52] times took out
[1:09:53] god in the pledge of allegiance in the
[1:09:56] democratic national convention
[1:09:58] and they're trying to take god
[1:09:59] completely out of our society as they
[1:10:02] took out prayers
[1:10:03] president kennedy was was there in
[1:10:05] office and they took out
[1:10:06] prayer from our schools and you look at
[1:10:08] now our schools are being shot up and
[1:10:10] people are dying well
[1:10:11] why is that because we took god out of
[1:10:13] the very foundation
[1:10:15] of our principle system and it seems as
[1:10:18] though we're not just republican versus
[1:10:20] democrat
[1:10:20] anymore but it's good versus evil it's
[1:10:23] not parties anymore but it's truly
[1:10:25] someone's trying to do good and evil has
[1:10:27] come in
[1:10:28] to break down every push for something
[1:10:31] that is good in this day
[1:10:33] and i say there's no hope in politics as
[1:10:35] we can see with the corruption
[1:10:37] and what's happened in this election and
[1:10:38] all that's gone on there is no hope in
[1:10:41] politics
[1:10:42] but the only hope is the coming of the
[1:10:44] lord for the bride of jesus christ
[1:10:46] if any man put his hope in making
[1:10:48] america great again
[1:10:49] if any man put his hope in the things of
[1:10:51] politics
[1:10:52] we now realize there is no hope in the
[1:10:55] things of the natural and if any man
[1:10:56] said oh well
[1:10:57] maybe we can get a few more years and
[1:10:59] and maybe we can just
[1:11:00] push on and brother brandon was right
[1:11:02] but maybe it's down the road well now
[1:11:03] those hopes for those things
[1:11:05] are gone our only hope is to be ready
[1:11:07] for the rapturing of the church in this
[1:11:10] day now
[1:11:13] we know the lord's going to come down
[1:11:14] the banks of glory one of these days and
[1:11:16] pull our vessels
[1:11:18] out of lady osea it's just another
[1:11:20] corner it's just another turn in the
[1:11:22] road
[1:11:23] in our vessels that we're fighting him
[1:11:25] we're struggling so hard
[1:11:26] eventually just gonna say well done my
[1:11:28] child my good and faithful servant and
[1:11:30] he's gonna pull us out of lady osea
[1:11:32] we won't have to struggle we won't have
[1:11:34] to go to school we won't have to go to
[1:11:35] college we won't have to fight anymore
[1:11:38] it'll be over and we can go on the other
[1:11:40] side with the lord
[1:11:42] now you you ask yourself well what is
[1:11:44] the reason
[1:11:45] why i'm why am i pushing so hard why am
[1:11:48] i fighting lady osea
[1:11:50] and you realize that it's christ the
[1:11:52] only reason that we wake up in the
[1:11:54] morning the only reason we breathe the
[1:11:56] only reason we have existence
[1:11:58] is because almighty god gave it to us in
[1:12:01] this day he's the only reason that i'm
[1:12:03] here
[1:12:03] is because i want to relay to you that
[1:12:05] christ is the answer
[1:12:08] in this day in 2020 of all falsehoods
[1:12:11] jesus christ is the answer to all of our
[1:12:14] problems
[1:12:15] in this day now it's a life that keeps
[1:12:18] our home clean
[1:12:20] it's a life that will pull you out of
[1:12:22] depression if you've ever dealt with
[1:12:23] depression or anyone who's dealt with
[1:12:25] depression you get
[1:12:26] so low and you get so down and the only
[1:12:29] person that can heal that you could try
[1:12:30] medicine you can try
[1:12:31] anything but jesus christ i present to
[1:12:34] you can
[1:12:35] deliver you from anything that you have
[1:12:37] in your life that's bringing you down
[1:12:39] and holding you in chains
[1:12:40] now it's a life that can give you a
[1:12:42] clear vision again as you started out
[1:12:44] the christian journey
[1:12:45] and you heard so much about god is good
[1:12:47] and god is wonderful and the rapture
[1:12:48] rapture's coming and the lord's here
[1:12:50] but satan comes to cloud your vision and
[1:12:53] christ is the only one that can clear
[1:12:55] your vision to
[1:12:56] make you realize that we are truly in
[1:12:58] the end time saints
[1:13:00] it's not a time to play around anymore
[1:13:02] we're in the end time
[1:13:03] there's only one or two more corners in
[1:13:05] the road and we're gonna be on the other
[1:13:07] shore so i say run
[1:13:08] and fight with everything that is within
[1:13:10] you not turn to turn around not time to
[1:13:13] look back
[1:13:13] oh what are they doing what are the
[1:13:15] jungles doing but no am i
[1:13:17] truly in a relationship with almighty
[1:13:19] god in this day
[1:13:21] it doesn't matter what family members we
[1:13:22] do it doesn't matter what friends may do
[1:13:25] and where all the masses they go
[1:13:26] we see people falling like droves but we
[1:13:29] see those who are standing for almighty
[1:13:31] god those are the overcomers in this day
[1:13:35] now i looked at the definition of alive
[1:13:39] it says having life not dead or
[1:13:42] inanimate
[1:13:42] still in existence force
[1:13:46] or an operation it's marked by alertness
[1:13:50] energy or briskness and in converse to
[1:13:53] that
[1:13:53] i looked up the definition for lukewarm
[1:13:55] it says moderately warm
[1:13:57] lacking conviction having or showing
[1:14:00] little ardor
[1:14:01] zeal or enthusiasm indifferent
[1:14:05] if you'll turn with me to revelation 3
[1:14:09] verse 15 and 16 revelation 3 verse 15
[1:14:13] and 16.
[1:14:18] and this is to lady osea
[1:14:22] he said i know thy works that thou art
[1:14:24] neither cold nor
[1:14:25] hot i would that thou art cold or hot
[1:14:29] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[1:14:31] neither cold nor hot
[1:14:33] i will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:14:36] and we see lukewarm as moderately warm
[1:14:39] showing little
[1:14:40] arter zeal enthusiasm indifferent
[1:14:43] is lukewarm there's a little bit of a
[1:14:45] desire for god but there's not truly
[1:14:46] enough desire to overcome
[1:14:48] and to fight the battles of lady osea
[1:14:52] and even this morning you know truly in
[1:14:55] your heart
[1:14:56] as you draw close to the lord and as you
[1:14:58] fight the battles
[1:14:59] you know if you're lukewarm or if you're
[1:15:02] truly fighting with all of your heart
[1:15:05] you know if you've let things in your
[1:15:06] life you know if you've let things
[1:15:08] happen even in your family and in your
[1:15:10] personal life and you know
[1:15:12] am i truly lukewarm or am i truly filled
[1:15:15] with the holy spirit
[1:15:17] to overcome and am i overcoming as paul
[1:15:19] said
[1:15:20] am i dying daily to overcome ladocia
[1:15:23] and i believe we know each one which
[1:15:25] state we're in if we get down to the
[1:15:27] bottom
[1:15:28] of where we're at if we can just take a
[1:15:30] snapshot of our personal spiritual life
[1:15:33] lord where am i and many times satan
[1:15:35] with thomas he tries to cloud your
[1:15:37] vision
[1:15:38] and make you oh i don't really know
[1:15:40] where i am but lord may you clarify my
[1:15:42] vision
[1:15:43] where am i today where am i this morning
[1:15:46] am i an overcomer am i fighting lady
[1:15:48] osea or am i drifting with the tides
[1:15:51] toward the waterfall
[1:15:53] now satan's desire is to leave you
[1:15:55] powerless in ladies he doesn't want you
[1:15:57] casting out devils
[1:15:59] he doesn't want you speaking in your
[1:16:00] tongues he doesn't want the gifts of the
[1:16:02] spirit to be operating in your life he
[1:16:04] just wants you to be
[1:16:05] lukewarm lady ocean and without
[1:16:08] enthusiasm in this day
[1:16:09] he wants you to have no prayer life no
[1:16:11] overcoming life
[1:16:12] no life to say i'm i'm done with this
[1:16:14] thing i'm done i'm giving it to god i'm
[1:16:17] done
[1:16:17] but he just wants you to be oh it's okay
[1:16:20] we'll just get it another day
[1:16:22] we'll overcome it another day when today
[1:16:24] is your day of salvation today if you
[1:16:26] will hear his voice
[1:16:27] hearty not your heart is in the
[1:16:29] propagation
[1:16:31] now he just wants you to get you going
[1:16:34] nowhere
[1:16:35] he wants you not to look forward not to
[1:16:37] see the rapture not to see the future of
[1:16:39] the church
[1:16:40] he just wants you to float he just wants
[1:16:42] you to
[1:16:43] cast your paddle down in your canoe and
[1:16:46] just
[1:16:48] kind of drifts with the tides that's
[1:16:49] satan's desire
[1:16:51] in this day and we can see
[1:16:54] that that's satan's desire and
[1:16:57] that desire will get you nowhere but
[1:16:59] headed back
[1:17:00] to a lukewarm lady ocean lifestyle like
[1:17:03] everybody else
[1:17:04] in lady osea we know if we take a break
[1:17:07] from fighting
[1:17:08] we know that eventually we'll be
[1:17:10] downstream and we'll never get to our
[1:17:12] heavenly home we'll never get to our
[1:17:14] final destination if we
[1:17:16] stay in a lukewarm condition in this day
[1:17:19] and you see a young person or middle age
[1:17:21] or elder you'll see them
[1:17:22] start to get complacent and even in a
[1:17:24] service they'll stop to worship and
[1:17:26] they'll stop to
[1:17:27] really enter into the service like they
[1:17:29] used to and you see maybe country music
[1:17:32] starts to come in and lust starts to
[1:17:34] come in
[1:17:34] and things of the world start to come in
[1:17:36] as they begin to get lukewarm and
[1:17:38] complacent in this day
[1:17:40] and eventually as we see even in
[1:17:44] if we were stopped to stop canoeing and
[1:17:46] we were just to go off to the side
[1:17:47] eventually all of that driftwood begins
[1:17:50] to come up to the side of your canoe
[1:17:52] and you now have all of these dead
[1:17:54] things around you that if you would have
[1:17:56] stayed in the channel and fought ladies
[1:17:58] see it you never would have had all
[1:17:59] those dead things around you
[1:18:01] but you could have easily navigated
[1:18:03] those things as long as you were in the
[1:18:05] battle and fighting
[1:18:06] and now we see a canoe that's just
[1:18:07] pulled off to the side and there's dead
[1:18:10] matter all around the canoe because it
[1:18:12] stopped fighting
[1:18:13] for its intended purpose to get to its
[1:18:15] final destination
[1:18:17] but you see in this situation
[1:18:20] as taking it down to our spiritual lives
[1:18:23] as we pull up to the side and we've been
[1:18:25] there maybe for months or maybe we've
[1:18:27] been there for years in a state of
[1:18:29] lethargicness
[1:18:30] and we hear the lord's voice saying adam
[1:18:32] adam where art thou
[1:18:34] where are you where have you been why
[1:18:37] aren't you
[1:18:37] singing why aren't you coming to the
[1:18:39] house of the lord where is your desire
[1:18:41] why don't you read the word like you
[1:18:42] used to why don't you pray why don't you
[1:18:44] seek why don't you fast like you used to
[1:18:46] where is the desire adam where art thou
[1:18:49] and you find this little canoe off to
[1:18:51] the side and if this canoe can just
[1:18:53] break away
[1:18:54] from all of those dead things if you can
[1:18:56] fight back to the mainstream it can
[1:18:58] eventually get to the final destination
[1:19:01] but it has to break out of the
[1:19:02] lethargicness
[1:19:04] that it's been in with all of the dead
[1:19:06] matter around
[1:19:07] it in proverbs 29 18 it says
[1:19:10] where there is no vision the people
[1:19:13] perish
[1:19:13] and satan wants to alter our vision and
[1:19:16] take our vision
[1:19:17] of why we're here we wake up we go to
[1:19:19] work we wake up go to work we wake up go
[1:19:21] to church
[1:19:22] go to work go home go back what is our
[1:19:24] purpose as brother branham spoke he said
[1:19:26] you're not just here
[1:19:28] to have a job and get a nicer house and
[1:19:30] a nicer car
[1:19:31] but you're here to get a purpose from
[1:19:34] almighty god that he established
[1:19:36] before the foundation of the world and
[1:19:38] you're here to go to your job to be a
[1:19:40] witness for almighty god
[1:19:42] you're here to be a witness to the
[1:19:44] people around you to those at walmart to
[1:19:46] those who are at the grocery store
[1:19:48] but you're not just here to be like
[1:19:49] every other lady or seeing
[1:19:51] in this day if we don't have a vision
[1:19:54] then what is the reason that we're
[1:19:56] fighting for
[1:19:56] why are we striving why are we here this
[1:19:59] morning if we don't have a vision
[1:20:01] of the other side as second corinthians
[1:20:04] 6
[1:20:04] 4 says 6 14 what communion hath light
[1:20:09] with darkness
[1:20:10] and we see lady oceans who want to get
[1:20:12] buddy buddy with us
[1:20:13] and want to get close to us and we see
[1:20:16] this desire to just kind of
[1:20:18] blend in with the world but what
[1:20:20] fellowship
[1:20:21] does someone who has life in this
[1:20:24] journey of life going upstream
[1:20:26] what do they have in fellowship to a log
[1:20:28] that's just drifting downstream
[1:20:30] there's no fellowship with a canoe
[1:20:33] that's powered by a force inside that
[1:20:35] you can't explain
[1:20:36] that's going upstream that's going up
[1:20:38] with the current
[1:20:40] there's no fellowship because you see
[1:20:41] the log you know where the logs going
[1:20:43] but in you there's a fire i've got to
[1:20:45] get to my final destination
[1:20:48] now people will think you're crazy and
[1:20:51] people will stand there and no doubt a
[1:20:53] law going downstream will say it's so
[1:20:55] much
[1:20:56] easier for me to go downstream why are
[1:20:58] you fighting
[1:21:00] against the current why are you rowing
[1:21:02] so hard it's so much easier to just
[1:21:04] drift with the tides
[1:21:06] brother random said in identification he
[1:21:08] said but listen
[1:21:09] anybody that's living right is an
[1:21:11] oddball
[1:21:12] to this modern world and you see in your
[1:21:15] life if you're living right even to your
[1:21:17] closest relatives even to your closest
[1:21:19] friends
[1:21:20] and you're living right and they're not
[1:21:21] and they'll treat you like an oddball
[1:21:23] because
[1:21:24] you're fighting and they don't
[1:21:25] understand why you're fighting they
[1:21:27] don't understand why you're investing in
[1:21:28] your kids they don't understand why
[1:21:30] that you're doing all these things to
[1:21:32] have a spiritual home
[1:21:33] and they're just going by the wayside
[1:21:35] and they can watch whatever movie they
[1:21:36] want to
[1:21:37] i don't care about the convictions we
[1:21:39] can just let anything in the house
[1:21:41] and they don't understand and you're the
[1:21:42] oddball that's fighting lady osea
[1:21:44] but know that if they hated christ they
[1:21:47] will hate you
[1:21:49] as john 15 18 says if the world hate you
[1:21:52] you know that it hated me before it
[1:21:55] hated you and to our men they might call
[1:21:57] you
[1:21:57] old-fashioned to our uh to our our men
[1:22:00] even in business they might call you
[1:22:02] honest abe and to the ladies they'll say
[1:22:04] why are you wearing a dress why are you
[1:22:05] wearing
[1:22:06] a you know hair that's so long and they
[1:22:09] don't understand
[1:22:10] this oddball mentality that you've been
[1:22:12] in they'll call you
[1:22:13] all honest abe or an honest female
[1:22:15] because you won't go to all the parties
[1:22:17] and do the things that they want you to
[1:22:19] do
[1:22:19] but even on a surface level because
[1:22:21] you'll go to walmart and you know you'll
[1:22:23] go you'll have friends on a surface
[1:22:25] level
[1:22:25] and everything's fine because we relate
[1:22:29] with the world and we're in this world
[1:22:30] but we're not of it
[1:22:31] and there's no way you can be a witness
[1:22:33] to someone that's around you if there's
[1:22:35] no
[1:22:36] life of christ projected to an everyday
[1:22:39] person
[1:22:39] at walmart or at the gas station and if
[1:22:42] you don't have that touch
[1:22:43] then pray that god gives you that touch
[1:22:47] once you get past the first
[1:22:51] just hey we talk about deer hunting we
[1:22:53] talk about
[1:22:54] fishing and brother brahm talked about
[1:22:56] that he said if he wants to talk about
[1:22:57] fish and talk about fishing
[1:22:59] if he wants to talk about hunt and talk
[1:23:01] about hunting and know that it's leading
[1:23:03] into
[1:23:04] a conversation about christ but then you
[1:23:06] begin to get into
[1:23:08] well have you heard god sent a prophet
[1:23:10] and then oh
[1:23:11] prophet stuff that just sounds crazy and
[1:23:13] then maybe they visit your church and
[1:23:15] they see all the women with long hair
[1:23:16] and they see the skirts
[1:23:18] and then they begin to turn ever so
[1:23:20] rapidly against you and you
[1:23:22] wonder why you're trying to show them
[1:23:23] the greatest thing that ever hit the
[1:23:25] face of the earth
[1:23:26] and they begin to turn and it's not
[1:23:28] because they hate you but they hate the
[1:23:29] crisis inside of you
[1:23:31] because they don't desire to go to the
[1:23:33] same place that you're going to
[1:23:35] do they don't desire to fight the same
[1:23:37] battle that you're fighting
[1:23:38] in this day and they'll say well why
[1:23:40] don't you have
[1:23:41] television why don't you watch all the
[1:23:43] movies and i remember even being
[1:23:45] homeschooled is
[1:23:46] i'd go to school and i'd be around all
[1:23:48] my friends and they'd start throwing
[1:23:50] movie quotes and like i have no idea
[1:23:51] what you're talking about
[1:23:53] i have no idea because i wasn't feeding
[1:23:55] on the same things that they were
[1:23:56] feeding on
[1:23:57] they'd say well you don't know who this
[1:23:58] actor is and and paying i'll pay to cuss
[1:24:02] and all these things
[1:24:03] and i didn't know what they were talking
[1:24:05] about because that was
[1:24:07] wasn't the stuff that i was putting in
[1:24:09] my vessel that wasn't the thing that i
[1:24:11] was trying to draw strength from because
[1:24:12] you know
[1:24:13] if you drew strength from those things
[1:24:15] you would eventually be like a log
[1:24:16] that's going down over the falls
[1:24:18] because there's no way that you could
[1:24:20] sustain life
[1:24:21] if you're feeding upon things that are
[1:24:23] dead
[1:24:26] in in john 2 28 it says and it shall
[1:24:29] come to pass
[1:24:30] afterward that i will pour out of my
[1:24:32] spirit upon all flesh
[1:24:34] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:24:35] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:24:38] and your young men shall see visions and
[1:24:40] we find
[1:24:41] in god's promised word that god's
[1:24:43] promised word is alive
[1:24:44] god's word in his spirit is the reason
[1:24:47] that we're still standing in this day
[1:24:49] that we're still going against all the
[1:24:50] tides of ladies we realize that it's
[1:24:52] his spirit that's kept us all of these
[1:24:55] years
[1:24:56] and we realize that his word as it said
[1:24:58] it'll come to pass
[1:24:59] afterward that he'll pour out his spirit
[1:25:02] to his true children
[1:25:04] in this day to his true children who he
[1:25:06] sees are fighting lady osea
[1:25:08] he will pour out his spirit and he will
[1:25:10] restore all the gifts and the
[1:25:12] manifestations of himself
[1:25:14] to those who are fighting lady osea in
[1:25:16] this day as we look at mary
[1:25:18] and the angel came to her and said
[1:25:20] blessed art thou mary
[1:25:22] you're highly favored among women
[1:25:25] and he told her that she would conceive
[1:25:27] not knowing a man
[1:25:29] and he said as mary she was just
[1:25:31] standing there and she said be it unto
[1:25:33] me according to thy word
[1:25:35] that was mary's desire when she heard
[1:25:37] the word is be it unto me according to
[1:25:39] that word
[1:25:40] it wasn't all well i don't see how that
[1:25:42] can happen but the true bride of christ
[1:25:44] the true child of god will say lord
[1:25:46] whatever you say to me be it unto me
[1:25:48] according to that word
[1:25:50] in this day as we see moses he esteemed
[1:25:53] the riches of christ
[1:25:54] more than all the treasures of egypt and
[1:25:57] we see moses
[1:25:58] he had it all man he had everything that
[1:26:00] he could have had
[1:26:02] as a man as a ruler a second in command
[1:26:04] to pharaoh
[1:26:05] he had it all but he saw that the mud
[1:26:08] daubers the chosen people of god
[1:26:11] that the mount sinai experienced that he
[1:26:13] had was worth
[1:26:14] more than all of the natural things in
[1:26:16] the natural kingdom that he could
[1:26:18] acquire
[1:26:19] and i believe each child of god has a
[1:26:21] vision of that for their lives
[1:26:23] but they see lady asia and they see the
[1:26:24] glamour and they see
[1:26:26] all the wonderful things of the world
[1:26:28] but they can also see
[1:26:29] truly in their heart they know it's all
[1:26:31] going to burn they know it will all pass
[1:26:33] away they know heavens and earth will
[1:26:35] pass away but the word of god will not
[1:26:37] pass away
[1:26:38] and they choose lord be it unto me
[1:26:40] according to thy word
[1:26:41] though family leaves no friend may leave
[1:26:44] but be it unto me
[1:26:45] according to thy word because i'm
[1:26:46] willing to surrender everything
[1:26:48] to your word in the state and we see
[1:26:50] rahab survive
[1:26:51] the great de destruction of her city
[1:26:54] because she received the word into her
[1:26:56] house
[1:26:57] brother branham even mentioned that they
[1:26:58] had slipped in some tapes to her
[1:27:00] and some tape boys had got to her and
[1:27:02] got her the message and she
[1:27:04] heard the message of that day and she
[1:27:05] accepted it and she
[1:27:07] hung the scarlet cord out of the window
[1:27:09] and she was saved because she heard the
[1:27:11] word
[1:27:12] she obeyed it she recognized it to be
[1:27:14] the truth and she acted upon the word
[1:27:16] that came forth to her
[1:27:18] in that day and the word was alive to
[1:27:20] her in 1964 the voice of the sign
[1:27:23] the son of man would be revealed in that
[1:27:25] day is that right
[1:27:27] what is revealed it's made known
[1:27:29] anything that's made known is revealed
[1:27:33] and we see that rebecca it was revealed
[1:27:35] to ellie azer
[1:27:36] that she would be the wife to isaac and
[1:27:39] it was revealed
[1:27:40] as eliezer was the type of the holy
[1:27:43] spirit
[1:27:44] in this day and rebecca came and watered
[1:27:47] the camels and
[1:27:48] eliezer instantly saw a desire to serve
[1:27:51] and
[1:27:51] he instantly just saw as he prayed and
[1:27:53] asked the lord lord if she comes and
[1:27:55] waters my camel and she watered both of
[1:27:57] the camels
[1:27:58] and it's interesting what he said in
[1:28:00] genesis 24 58
[1:28:02] and they called rebecca and said unto
[1:28:04] her will thou go with this man
[1:28:07] and this was after he had revealed
[1:28:09] everything that had transpired
[1:28:11] everything that he had seen that esther
[1:28:14] that um
[1:28:15] that rebecca had had done everything
[1:28:18] that she had done and
[1:28:19] after that he told the family what she'd
[1:28:22] done
[1:28:23] and they called rebecca and said unto
[1:28:24] her will thou go with this man
[1:28:26] and she said i will go and we can type
[1:28:29] that to the bride of christ because
[1:28:32] the lord will say wilt thou lay down
[1:28:34] everything as the rich young ruler
[1:28:36] he was not willing to lay down
[1:28:37] everything but the lord will come to you
[1:28:39] and you listen to a message and you'll
[1:28:41] be all alone and the holy spirit will
[1:28:42] speak to you
[1:28:44] and they'll say are you willing to lay
[1:28:45] down that pride are you willing to lay
[1:28:47] down that phone number are you willing
[1:28:49] to lay down that lust
[1:28:50] are you willing to lay down that music
[1:28:52] are you willing to lay it all down
[1:28:54] and she would say i can give everything
[1:28:57] up for the holy spirit to be pleased
[1:28:59] in my life complete type of the bride of
[1:29:02] christ
[1:29:02] in her day and we can say i will go
[1:29:06] in no matter what the cost no matter
[1:29:09] what lady osea will offer us
[1:29:11] we can give everything that we have to
[1:29:13] christ knowing that in this battle on
[1:29:15] the other side when all the logs and
[1:29:17] they receive their reward and they
[1:29:18] receive their witches
[1:29:20] riches they receive their wealth and
[1:29:21] their fame but we know that on the other
[1:29:23] side
[1:29:24] that desire to give up everything will
[1:29:26] eventually pay off and our investment
[1:29:28] will reap dividends on the other side i
[1:29:31] will go
[1:29:32] and who is this he said know him then
[1:29:35] there
[1:29:35] is no question to it you know you've
[1:29:37] passed from death into life because you
[1:29:39] know him
[1:29:40] his spirit dwells in you you take his
[1:29:42] nature his word is alive in you
[1:29:45] everything he said is amen
[1:29:48] and you remember when you were dead in
[1:29:50] sin as many of you came out just
[1:29:51] straight from the world
[1:29:52] not even a denominational background but
[1:29:55] you just came straight from sin
[1:29:56] you came straight from even the bar
[1:29:58] stool and you remember when you heard
[1:30:00] the voice of god and
[1:30:01] completely changed your heart and you
[1:30:02] heard that god could come and change a
[1:30:04] vessel and came
[1:30:05] one that was so sticked in sin and
[1:30:08] completely
[1:30:08] revolutionized your life to cause you to
[1:30:11] be an overcoming child
[1:30:13] in this age he broke every chain
[1:30:16] and he made you a new creature and
[1:30:18] there's no other power that you know
[1:30:20] that you tried everything and you tried
[1:30:22] every drug and you tried
[1:30:23] every little town hall that you could go
[1:30:25] to but there was no power
[1:30:27] that could overcome the things that you
[1:30:28] were dealing with and
[1:30:30] christ was the only one that could
[1:30:31] reconcile you to himself
[1:30:34] and you used to doubt it but now you
[1:30:36] can't live
[1:30:38] without it as there's the song it says
[1:30:40] real real he's so real to me
[1:30:42] many people doubt it but i can't live
[1:30:44] without it and that is why i love him
[1:30:46] because he's so real to me
[1:30:47] and so many people they don't understand
[1:30:49] oh he's an oddball but to you it's been
[1:30:51] revealed my god is real he's real
[1:30:54] in my soul he may not be reeling their
[1:30:56] soul but he's real in my soul
[1:31:00] now if god's word takes preeminence his
[1:31:02] spirit takes full control
[1:31:05] and and god keeps his word in 1957 he
[1:31:08] said don't expect the road to be flowery
[1:31:10] and a bed of ease
[1:31:11] it's going to be a rough and ragged road
[1:31:14] but it's going
[1:31:16] it's going to be a blessed road because
[1:31:18] he promised
[1:31:19] he'd be with you and he promised he'd be
[1:31:22] with you and even
[1:31:23] in the struggle as you're rowing up the
[1:31:25] stream
[1:31:26] he promised that he'd be with you and if
[1:31:28] you know that he's in the boat
[1:31:30] you know you can't capsize and you know
[1:31:33] you can't go back and go over the falls
[1:31:35] and be a wreck
[1:31:36] and a heap somewhere because he's in the
[1:31:38] boat
[1:31:40] and as he promised he'd be with you i'll
[1:31:43] just give you some testimonies of even
[1:31:45] my personal experience and just of my
[1:31:48] pastors
[1:31:49] our pastor was running away from home
[1:31:51] and he was on a train
[1:31:53] and he was running away and he was gonna
[1:31:55] go do his own thing and they were coming
[1:31:57] up
[1:31:58] on a tunnel and he was just holding on
[1:32:00] to the side of a train and he was gonna
[1:32:02] be
[1:32:03] the cool i think he was 16 17 years old
[1:32:05] and he was going to be
[1:32:06] this great guy that ran away from home
[1:32:08] and on a train
[1:32:10] headed to where he was headed and a big
[1:32:12] tunnel came
[1:32:13] and he was holding onto the side of the
[1:32:14] train and he had a just a piece of glove
[1:32:16] to cover up his face and you can
[1:32:18] even remember the old trains how much
[1:32:20] smoke they had that was billowing back
[1:32:22] and they were inside the tunnel now and
[1:32:24] all that smoke was coming
[1:32:26] back and was blowing on our pastor and
[1:32:28] all he had was a little glove
[1:32:30] there and he almost let go and almost
[1:32:32] pass away but it wasn't god's time for
[1:32:34] him to die
[1:32:36] it wasn't god's time for him to let go
[1:32:38] and hit the side and completely die
[1:32:39] because
[1:32:40] god wasn't finished with our pastor at
[1:32:42] that time and
[1:32:43] even myself had a brick wall fall on me
[1:32:46] and completely gashed up my head
[1:32:48] underneath my hair
[1:32:49] and it wasn't god's time for me to die
[1:32:52] no doubt you've probably been in a car
[1:32:53] wreck or been close to
[1:32:55] some sort of accident and it wasn't your
[1:32:57] time and god's almighty angel was there
[1:33:00] with you
[1:33:01] in that time to keep you going because
[1:33:03] he knew in your allotted time that his
[1:33:05] grace would be sufficient and he would
[1:33:07] catch you
[1:33:08] even in a time of sin as i've heard so
[1:33:10] many testimonies of people out sinning
[1:33:12] and they almost had that time where they
[1:33:13] died and god kept them
[1:33:15] for a certain purpose and a certain
[1:33:17] reason there's a man in our church that
[1:33:19] came to the lord
[1:33:20] he shot himself two times in the head
[1:33:21] with the 45 caliber pistol
[1:33:24] and he didn't die and we just recently
[1:33:26] baptized him
[1:33:27] and if that doesn't grace i don't know
[1:33:29] what is
[1:33:30] to shoot yourself two times with the 45
[1:33:33] caliber pistol
[1:33:34] god has a purpose for that man in his
[1:33:36] life
[1:33:37] and if god's not finished with us here
[1:33:41] then there's nothing that can take us
[1:33:43] until our time
[1:33:44] and as we've seen many many many times
[1:33:48] as god has taken ones and we wonder why
[1:33:50] but god was
[1:33:51] finished with their card and he pulled
[1:33:53] their card and it was their time to go
[1:33:56] but there's a reason why we're here this
[1:33:58] morning is one more time of grace to be
[1:34:00] allotted to a backslider to someone
[1:34:02] who's maybe away from god who's someone
[1:34:04] who needs encouragement to know that god
[1:34:06] is still on the throne to touch us this
[1:34:08] morning to encourage us
[1:34:10] in this day and he said each hair of our
[1:34:12] head is numbered
[1:34:14] and he knows the hairs of our heads and
[1:34:16] if he cares about our hairs doesn't he
[1:34:18] care about your life as well as
[1:34:19] some of us have more hairs than others
[1:34:21] but that's okay because
[1:34:23] he cares about your life more than your
[1:34:25] hair and you think about how many hairs
[1:34:27] are in the head
[1:34:28] does god care about each one he knows
[1:34:30] every number does he not
[1:34:32] care about your soul this morning does
[1:34:33] he not care that you came into the house
[1:34:35] of the lord
[1:34:36] to hear from almighty god he cares this
[1:34:38] morning
[1:34:39] as job came in and satan and god met
[1:34:42] together
[1:34:43] and god said do whatever you want to do
[1:34:45] to him but don't take his life and he
[1:34:47] took his children
[1:34:48] he took everything from him in the trial
[1:34:50] in the lowest part of job's life
[1:34:52] and he said the lord gave and the lord
[1:34:54] had taken away blessed be the name of
[1:34:56] the lord
[1:34:58] and many of us have no doubt been in
[1:35:00] times in our lives where
[1:35:02] there was nothing that we could do there
[1:35:04] is absolutely nothing we could do
[1:35:06] and um even this month as a deer hunter
[1:35:09] i was out in the woods and
[1:35:10] i had just gotten down from a stand at
[1:35:12] hunted hard slept like two or three
[1:35:13] nights in my truck
[1:35:15] and uh i got down on the ground and um i
[1:35:18] just fell asleep because
[1:35:19] i was exhausted and i was about 25 26
[1:35:22] foot off the ground
[1:35:23] and for me to fall asleep up there it
[1:35:24] was almost just non-existent there's no
[1:35:26] way
[1:35:27] i could do that and i got down on the
[1:35:29] ground slept for about 15 minutes
[1:35:31] stood up look over to my left there's a
[1:35:33] massive 10 pointer standing
[1:35:34] and my bow was in the tree so there's
[1:35:37] nothing that i can do
[1:35:39] but watch this buck walk off and
[1:35:43] it was a very frustrating moment as you
[1:35:45] can tell
[1:35:46] and as you can even imagine being a
[1:35:48] hunter and thinking i can't do anything
[1:35:50] but we've all been in those times when
[1:35:53] even children have gone astray
[1:35:55] we've all been in those times where
[1:35:56] something has happened to our health
[1:35:58] and there is nothing that we can do but
[1:36:01] trust
[1:36:02] on almighty god even in the stream
[1:36:05] something might hit our vessel and
[1:36:06] something that we weren't expecting to
[1:36:08] happen and there was
[1:36:09] nothing that we could do in that moment
[1:36:12] but trust
[1:36:12] almighty god to keep our craft facing in
[1:36:15] the right direction
[1:36:17] and we all reach those moments in our
[1:36:19] life when we realize god is in control
[1:36:21] we don't know what god is trying to
[1:36:22] teach us we don't know what we're trying
[1:36:24] to learn in that moment
[1:36:25] but we can rest in almighty god to know
[1:36:27] that he is in control of our vessel as
[1:36:29] long as we're doing our
[1:36:31] part to fight the currents of lady osea
[1:36:35] and i believe god works in impossible
[1:36:37] things in
[1:36:38] impossible situations in impossible
[1:36:40] sicknesses
[1:36:41] god works and impossible someone you'd
[1:36:44] say god could never restore that person
[1:36:46] back
[1:36:46] and then you see much years down the
[1:36:48] road god restores that person back
[1:36:51] god works in impossible situations
[1:36:54] as the children of israel came to the
[1:36:56] red sea
[1:36:57] and it was a complete red sea in front
[1:36:59] of them and
[1:37:00] pharaoh and all of his army were coming
[1:37:02] behind them it was a completely
[1:37:03] impossible situation
[1:37:05] but almighty god sent the pillar of fire
[1:37:07] and opened the red sea
[1:37:08] in an impossible situation and we can
[1:37:11] see even
[1:37:13] in lazarus a man that had been dead for
[1:37:15] four days
[1:37:17] a completely impossible situation and
[1:37:20] martha said
[1:37:21] as we read if thou had us been here my
[1:37:23] brother had not died
[1:37:25] and jesus said i am the resurrection and
[1:37:28] the life
[1:37:30] i am the resurrection i am the life
[1:37:33] giver to your situation
[1:37:35] lord how can i be delivered how can i
[1:37:37] get out of this just come to jesus
[1:37:39] that's where satan tries to get us
[1:37:41] confused when just come to the source
[1:37:43] giver
[1:37:44] jesus come and deliver me from the
[1:37:46] situation that i'm
[1:37:47] in he said i'm the resurrection in the
[1:37:50] life and he said
[1:37:51] where have you laid him where is your
[1:37:54] trouble
[1:37:54] and i will i will completely deliver you
[1:37:57] out of your trouble where is your
[1:37:58] trouble
[1:37:59] give it to jesus and he can take it from
[1:38:01] you as we find the shunamite woman was
[1:38:03] given a son
[1:38:04] and the shunammite woman came to elijah
[1:38:07] and this is so amazing because we can
[1:38:08] even think of maybe this was like little
[1:38:10] jonathan or
[1:38:11] little emmy and you come to the man of
[1:38:14] god
[1:38:15] and you're holding your baby in your
[1:38:17] hands and you're you're to the man of
[1:38:18] god
[1:38:19] and he says it's all well and she says
[1:38:22] all is well
[1:38:23] when she reaches the man of god when she
[1:38:26] reaches the presence of the lord she
[1:38:27] knows
[1:38:28] all is well if we can just get in his
[1:38:30] presence as the woman with the blood
[1:38:31] issue
[1:38:32] if she could just have one touch one
[1:38:35] moment in the presence of almighty god
[1:38:37] we know that she could be made whole
[1:38:39] and in your life if we could just get in
[1:38:40] the presence for one time
[1:38:42] that thing that's been holding on to us
[1:38:44] that baggage that thing that we've been
[1:38:46] struggling with
[1:38:46] for years and months in our lives if we
[1:38:48] could just get in the presence of the
[1:38:50] lord
[1:38:50] and his special touch and he could cut
[1:38:53] that thing away from our life
[1:38:54] then we know that we could be in an
[1:38:56] impossible situation where you say i
[1:38:58] can't overcome this
[1:38:59] but god works in the impossible
[1:39:01] situations if god could do it for the
[1:39:04] israel for the hebrew children
[1:39:06] if god could do it for lazarus then why
[1:39:08] can't he do it for you
[1:39:09] and your emotional battle and your
[1:39:11] trouble and your temptation
[1:39:13] why cannot god do that for you this
[1:39:15] morning
[1:39:17] as the lame man no doubt he was
[1:39:18] depressed as he'd been
[1:39:20] lame for years at the gate
[1:39:24] and for years he'd been dealing with
[1:39:25] this thing in his life
[1:39:27] and he no doubt was completely in
[1:39:29] discouragement saying
[1:39:30] i am not going to be free but
[1:39:33] as peter came and said look on us
[1:39:37] and he said silver and gold have i none
[1:39:39] but such as i have i give to thee
[1:39:41] in the name of jesus christ rise up and
[1:39:43] walk and that thing that he'd been in
[1:39:45] depression and despondency for all of
[1:39:47] those years sitting at the gate
[1:39:48] and in one moment in the presence of
[1:39:50] almighty god he was completely delivered
[1:39:53] and made whole
[1:39:54] again we think about in our lives as we
[1:39:56] have those times where we get so
[1:39:58] low in our lives and almighty god comes
[1:40:01] by
[1:40:03] and delivers us instantly but we also
[1:40:06] have times where god chooses not to come
[1:40:07] instantly
[1:40:08] but we're battling we're fighting satan
[1:40:10] and as the footprints on the sands of
[1:40:12] time you've heard this many times of the
[1:40:14] parable
[1:40:14] the person seeing two footprints and two
[1:40:17] two rows of footprints in the sand and
[1:40:19] two people no doubt walking down the
[1:40:20] sand you and the lord jesus and i
[1:40:22] but there comes a point when there's
[1:40:24] only one set of footprints now
[1:40:26] and you get some person gets mad and
[1:40:27] says lord why weren't you walking with
[1:40:29] me he said no that was the time that i
[1:40:31] was carrying you
[1:40:32] that was the time when you were
[1:40:33] completely so low and you said i want to
[1:40:36] give up
[1:40:36] and i want to give up my aura and i'm
[1:40:38] done fighting lady osea but that was the
[1:40:40] time that almighty god steered your ship
[1:40:43] and he took over from you for you there
[1:40:45] in that time and there was only one set
[1:40:47] of footprints but that was almighty god
[1:40:49] coming in your lowest time
[1:40:51] as the children of israel right in the
[1:40:53] time when they needed almighty god
[1:40:55] that's when god came on the scene now in
[1:40:58] ephesians 1 1-2
[1:41:00] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[1:41:03] will of god
[1:41:04] to the saints which are at episode
[1:41:06] ephesus and to the faithful in christ
[1:41:09] jesus grace be to you and
[1:41:12] peace from god our father and from the
[1:41:15] lord jesus christ
[1:41:17] and we see here that god blesses the
[1:41:18] faithful those who are faithful to the
[1:41:20] house of the lord
[1:41:22] those who have been faithful to the
[1:41:24] people of god those who have been
[1:41:25] faithful in their ties
[1:41:26] in their offerings as he promised that
[1:41:28] he'd open up the heavens of heaven to
[1:41:30] open up all the riches of heaven if you
[1:41:32] were faithful
[1:41:33] in your tithes and your offerings you
[1:41:35] talked about robbing
[1:41:36] almighty god and the tithes and the
[1:41:38] offerings but there's a people who have
[1:41:40] remained faithful
[1:41:42] and we see paul an apostle of jesus
[1:41:45] christ by the will of god to the saints
[1:41:47] which are in ephesus and to the faithful
[1:41:50] in christ jesus
[1:41:52] and there's a blessing to the faithful
[1:41:54] we all have our ups and our downs and
[1:41:56] but as the prophet instructed us to be
[1:41:58] in the house of the lord every time when
[1:41:59] the doors are open
[1:42:01] every time when those doors are open
[1:42:02] when there's a time that you can come to
[1:42:04] the house of the lord and you're there
[1:42:05] there is a blessing for those who are
[1:42:07] faithful and no doubt you see
[1:42:09] that man who came and was faithful to
[1:42:11] the house of the lord and his wife was
[1:42:13] faithful to the house of the lord and
[1:42:14] you see their children and they become
[1:42:16] faithful to the house of the lord
[1:42:17] and the lord blesses the entire church
[1:42:19] after years and years of faithfulness
[1:42:22] and that's a blessing
[1:42:23] from almighty god to god's children who
[1:42:25] are faithful
[1:42:26] in this day he said grace and peace
[1:42:29] be upon you grace and peace to you
[1:42:33] and through the ups and the downs if
[1:42:36] you've been faithful
[1:42:37] to the lord he said that he would reward
[1:42:40] you for that
[1:42:42] and he said even in that songs we sing
[1:42:45] it will be worth it all when we see
[1:42:47] jesus
[1:42:47] if you've heard that song life trials
[1:42:49] will seem so small
[1:42:50] when we see christ one glimpse of his
[1:42:53] dear face
[1:42:54] all sorrows will erase and this struggle
[1:42:56] and this trial of life as we're lowering
[1:42:58] and we're growing and we're trying to
[1:43:00] get through
[1:43:00] lady osea but you realize that
[1:43:04] it will be worth it all when we get on
[1:43:05] the other side
[1:43:07] when those temptations have come to you
[1:43:08] and you've continued to fight in battle
[1:43:10] and continued to come back to the well
[1:43:12] of grace and continued
[1:43:14] to draw closer to the lord there will be
[1:43:17] a time when the lord will reward you
[1:43:19] when everybody else was going astray and
[1:43:21] everybody was accepting
[1:43:22] accepting the societal norm and you
[1:43:24] stood and you said after me in my house
[1:43:26] we will serve the lord
[1:43:28] there will be a time of reward for you
[1:43:30] as you've chosen to put the lord first
[1:43:32] in your life now the bible says these
[1:43:35] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:43:38] and sons of god are led by the spirit of
[1:43:41] god and
[1:43:42] as on the day of pentecost as the life
[1:43:44] came into the church and the
[1:43:46] pentecostal blessings came into the
[1:43:49] church
[1:43:49] and god promised that he'd restore all
[1:43:51] of that back in this day as he promised
[1:43:53] through malachi 4 5
[1:43:55] and all of these blessings that have
[1:43:56] come into the church but now here we
[1:43:58] stand
[1:43:59] and the signs have come back into the
[1:44:01] church so are we
[1:44:02] as the bride of jesus christ are we
[1:44:05] ready and that's my message even this
[1:44:06] morning
[1:44:07] is it alive to you as the bride of
[1:44:09] christ is it alive
[1:44:11] personally revealed to us are the signs
[1:44:13] following our lives are we led by the
[1:44:15] spirit of god
[1:44:17] god's life entered in but god's life has
[1:44:19] not
[1:44:20] left is brother random talked so many
[1:44:21] times about the signs and the wonders
[1:44:23] and
[1:44:23] people saying that the signs and the
[1:44:25] wonders are of things gone by
[1:44:26] but brother barum said where did god
[1:44:28] ever take those things out of the church
[1:44:30] where did god ever take the holy spirit
[1:44:32] moving with your heart
[1:44:34] in a service like this where did god
[1:44:36] ever take the freeness of the holy
[1:44:37] spirit out of the church
[1:44:39] his denominations are dead the world is
[1:44:41] dead the world is dying
[1:44:42] why are we faithful why are we desiring
[1:44:44] to be in the house of the lord because
[1:44:46] his holy spirit
[1:44:47] is drawing us it's drawing us in this
[1:44:49] last day not to go with the flow
[1:44:51] not to go with ladies but to press on
[1:44:53] unto the rapture
[1:44:55] philippians 4 13 says i can do all
[1:44:58] things through christ which
[1:44:59] strengtheneth me
[1:45:01] and we can crest every way we can get
[1:45:03] through every storm
[1:45:04] as long as christ is at the helm of our
[1:45:06] boat as long as christ is at the helm of
[1:45:08] our ship
[1:45:10] and in a race it's not always about how
[1:45:14] you start
[1:45:15] it's about how you finish is no doubt in
[1:45:19] the canoeing trip as everyone's canoeing
[1:45:21] and we're trying to get to the elk camp
[1:45:23] and we're trying to get to our final
[1:45:25] destination and no doubt many of your
[1:45:28] friends and dear loved ones
[1:45:29] have lost their way and they started out
[1:45:32] so strong and there was such a zeal and
[1:45:34] such a fight and such a desire
[1:45:36] but now where are they as
[1:45:40] even a message maybe the lord will put
[1:45:42] on my heart is where are they where are
[1:45:44] all the people that you started with
[1:45:47] and where are they now where is their
[1:45:48] desire where where is the fight in the
[1:45:51] zeal it's not all about where we start
[1:45:53] but are we going to finish the race in
[1:45:55] this day are we going to finish the race
[1:45:57] that is set before us
[1:45:59] in this day and we think about even how
[1:46:01] few
[1:46:02] of people will be saved in this last
[1:46:04] days caleb and joshua had said
[1:46:07] brother brahm said it was one in a
[1:46:08] million two million people came out and
[1:46:10] only one was saved
[1:46:11] and i just did a simple calculation on
[1:46:13] that and as a point zero
[1:46:15] zero zero zero one percent
[1:46:18] of overcomers in that day that was a
[1:46:20] success ratio not one percent
[1:46:23] but such a small percentage of people
[1:46:25] that would overcome
[1:46:26] and those weren't even the egyptians
[1:46:28] those were the people who came out those
[1:46:30] were the jews who came out of egypt
[1:46:32] such a small percentage of people that
[1:46:34] would overcome in this day
[1:46:36] so don't get discouraged when you see
[1:46:38] people leaving and you see people going
[1:46:40] by the wayside and no desire for the
[1:46:42] things of god
[1:46:43] but realize that there's only going to
[1:46:45] be a few saves but make sure
[1:46:47] that you're one of the fews brother
[1:46:48] brandon talked about even one in a state
[1:46:50] but may we be that one may we be even a
[1:46:53] desire in our heart is not to go back
[1:46:55] and not to flow with lady osea but may
[1:46:57] there be such a fight
[1:46:59] and such a desire in our souls to not be
[1:47:01] part of lady osea and go
[1:47:03] with all the dead substances and matters
[1:47:05] but may we fight
[1:47:06] with everything that is within us he
[1:47:08] says fear not little flock and if the
[1:47:10] musicians would come
[1:47:12] this morning this afternoon
[1:47:15] in galatians 5 1 it says stand fast
[1:47:17] therefore in the liberty wherewith
[1:47:19] christ hath made us free
[1:47:21] and be not entangled again with the yoke
[1:47:23] of bondage
[1:47:25] be not entangled again with those things
[1:47:27] that held you bound
[1:47:30] when you were delivered of drinking when
[1:47:32] you were delivered of drugs when you
[1:47:33] were delivered of alcohol
[1:47:35] but be not entangled again with those
[1:47:37] things that held you bound
[1:47:39] in your life and to those who have maybe
[1:47:42] gotten away from the lord
[1:47:43] and maybe at one point you were close to
[1:47:45] the lord and you were right there
[1:47:47] every beck and plea god what do you want
[1:47:48] to speak to me what do i
[1:47:50] what's your purpose for my life but to
[1:47:52] those who are backslid if you can play
[1:47:54] draw me near
[1:47:55] to those who maybe have gotten away from
[1:47:57] the lord he says
[1:47:59] in verse 7 you did run well but who did
[1:48:02] hinder you
[1:48:03] that you should not obey the truth you
[1:48:06] did run well you did overcome at one
[1:48:08] point in your life but
[1:48:10] why are we not overcoming now why are we
[1:48:12] not fighting like we used to why is our
[1:48:15] vessel not going forward
[1:48:17] instead of just in a stagnant place well
[1:48:19] i'm not really going backwards but
[1:48:22] everything around you is dead and
[1:48:25] there's no movement towards your eternal
[1:48:27] destination
[1:48:28] of the other side why are we in this
[1:48:31] dead situation
[1:48:32] we know if we go back there's a false
[1:48:34] and if we know if we stay where we're at
[1:48:36] we're going to die and we'll never make
[1:48:38] it to our heavenly home
[1:48:40] so what did hinder you and
[1:48:43] those of us who are trying to take up
[1:48:46] our crosses and die daily
[1:48:48] the lord sees that to those who have let
[1:48:50] down and maybe gotten a little far away
[1:48:52] from the lord the lord sees that as well
[1:48:54] and he's saying come home why don't you
[1:48:56] draw nearer he said draw nigh to god and
[1:48:58] he will draw an eye to you
[1:49:00] in this day and there are those who
[1:49:03] become
[1:49:03] weary it's lady oseah it's a fight
[1:49:06] if you're not fighting if you're not
[1:49:09] fighting in a war in a battle then
[1:49:11] you're not in a battle you're just
[1:49:12] in a picnic somewhere but in this day
[1:49:16] if you're having a desire to fight but
[1:49:18] you're weary
[1:49:19] in the battle as satan comes to each one
[1:49:22] of us and tries to make us lukewarm and
[1:49:24] lady ocean
[1:49:25] and you can see all around you is just
[1:49:29] dead wood and you can see everything
[1:49:31] around you has died
[1:49:33] and you say lord i don't know what i've
[1:49:36] done to cause this to happen
[1:49:38] for me to be in such a stagnant place
[1:49:40] with you
[1:49:41] but lord i'm willing to pick up my armor
[1:49:43] i'm willing to take up my sword
[1:49:45] i'm willing to take up my cross once
[1:49:48] again and follow you
[1:49:49] for truly the hour is late and it's time
[1:49:51] to fight it's not a time to backslide
[1:49:54] it's not a time to go to the things of
[1:49:56] the world it's a time to fight
[1:49:58] with everything that is within you if
[1:50:01] you can just bow your heads
[1:50:03] today and let's just pray
[1:50:07] and let's just ask the lord if maybe the
[1:50:10] lord is
[1:50:11] dealt with your heart in regards to
[1:50:14] maybe you're not close to him like you
[1:50:16] used to be
[1:50:18] and maybe there was a
[1:50:21] time in your life where he dealt with
[1:50:23] you and he delivered you of so many
[1:50:25] things in your life
[1:50:27] and you reached a point where you just
[1:50:29] wanted to turn over to the side
[1:50:31] and you just turned your vessel
[1:50:34] and all of a sudden now these dead
[1:50:37] things
[1:50:38] of stumps and these pieces of wood are
[1:50:41] beginning to collect around your vessel
[1:50:44] and you knew you weren't intended to be
[1:50:47] in this condition
[1:50:49] but you were intended to fight you were
[1:50:51] intended to overcome you were intended
[1:50:53] to reach your final destination
[1:50:54] but you know in your current state that
[1:50:57] you're not going to reach your final
[1:50:58] destination
[1:51:00] if you can't get out of the dead things
[1:51:02] that are around you that have
[1:51:04] bound you for this period of time in
[1:51:06] your life and
[1:51:08] if you've been backslid this morning if
[1:51:11] you've been backslid today i say the
[1:51:13] lord is calling to you
[1:51:16] and he's calling why don't you just
[1:51:17] shake yourself
[1:51:20] as simpson he had his eyes put out and
[1:51:22] he was grinding at the mill but he said
[1:51:24] if you can just lead me to the pillars
[1:51:26] and he said once more lord
[1:51:29] and if you can say even today once more
[1:51:31] lord i know what you did for me long ago
[1:51:34] but i've been bound by something there's
[1:51:36] been something that's held me down
[1:51:38] and i feel stagnant in my spiritual walk
[1:51:40] but you'd say lord
[1:51:42] would you revive me would you say once
[1:51:45] more lord jesus if you say that if
[1:51:47] that's your desire
[1:51:48] here and you say once more lord once
[1:51:51] more would your presence come and would
[1:51:53] your presence deal with me
[1:51:55] would your presence move over my life
[1:51:57] once more father
[1:51:58] i know i've been stagnant in my
[1:52:00] spiritual walk i haven't prayed i
[1:52:02] haven't sought you
[1:52:03] i haven't really given my life to you i
[1:52:05] haven't listened to the word i used to
[1:52:07] but i don't anymore and now you're
[1:52:09] stagnant and the things of the world are
[1:52:11] beginning to overtake your vessel
[1:52:13] and you'd say even today lord once more
[1:52:16] father would your sweet holy spirit come
[1:52:18] by my vessel
[1:52:20] and you just raise your hand tonight and
[1:52:22] you say lord
[1:52:23] revive me lord once more
[1:52:26] you'd say once again today lord once
[1:52:28] more would you fill my vessel with your
[1:52:30] love
[1:52:31] would you get rid of all these other
[1:52:32] things would you get back in my vessel
[1:52:34] if i said would you politely leave my
[1:52:36] vessel
[1:52:36] and you'd say lord once more father
[1:52:40] would you get rid of all this trash
[1:52:42] that's around me i want to reach the
[1:52:44] rapture lord i know in my current state
[1:52:46] i can't make it
[1:52:47] maybe there's some of you who have been
[1:52:48] filled and you've been fighting you've
[1:52:50] been struggling but you've been weary
[1:52:51] and you're
[1:52:52] fighting and you're continuing to try
[1:52:54] and help your children and keep
[1:52:55] satan out of your home and you'd say
[1:52:57] lord i'm weary
[1:52:58] would you come lord and refresh me in
[1:53:02] your spirit
[1:53:04] let's just pray and just ask the lord
[1:53:06] that he'd come and refresh us
[1:53:08] he'd refresh our homes and refresh our
[1:53:10] desires
[1:53:12] that he get rid of all the unhealthy
[1:53:14] desires in our lives all the dead things
[1:53:16] in our lives
[1:53:18] let's just pray today lord jesus you see
[1:53:21] your holy spirit
[1:53:22] even here lord it's a unique service and
[1:53:24] unique message lord
[1:53:26] jesus father as i deliver these things
[1:53:29] that i felt that you laid out my heart
[1:53:30] lord is
[1:53:32] a simple little message lord jesus but
[1:53:34] father
[1:53:36] there are people who are dying lord
[1:53:39] they truly don't know how much longer
[1:53:40] they can take lady ocean they don't know
[1:53:42] how much longer they can fight
[1:53:44] as a mother who's fighting to keep her
[1:53:46] children consecrated as a
[1:53:48] father who's trying to apply the token
[1:53:50] to his home
[1:53:52] and they say lord i'm weary at times
[1:53:54] lord would you come even this morning
[1:53:56] and refill me father
[1:53:58] lord jesus we pray that you'd bless your
[1:54:00] children here father
[1:54:01] lord jesus may you shake them lord if
[1:54:03] they're lethargic father
[1:54:05] lord if they need a new touch from you
[1:54:07] if they feel like they've backslidden
[1:54:09] from you and they don't know how to get
[1:54:10] out and they don't know how to shake
[1:54:12] from the cove that they pulled into
[1:54:14] but father may your holy spirit go to
[1:54:16] them even now lord jesus
[1:54:18] in a unique way lord if this whole
[1:54:19] service was just for one
[1:54:21] to shake him or her from their position
[1:54:24] if there's just one who's been weary in
[1:54:26] the journey but knowing that there is a
[1:54:28] final destination
[1:54:29] there is a final place the resting place
[1:54:32] but now we must fight if we must win
[1:54:35] may you encourage the weary father lord
[1:54:37] jesus may you restore the backslid i
[1:54:39] pray
[1:54:40] father in the service we come to you
[1:54:42] lord jesus asking in your precious holy
[1:54:45] name
[1:54:45] the name of the lord jesus christ would
[1:54:47] you bless your people father if we would
[1:54:50] all stand this morning and just sing
[1:54:52] that song
[1:54:52] draw me nearer drama near draw me
