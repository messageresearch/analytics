[15:34] important
[16:04] um children can be dismissed for Sunday
[16:05] school and then we'll go in the Psalms
[16:07] again to we're going to go to Psalms 118
[16:09] we're going to finish that Psalms out so
[16:13] Psalms 118.
[16:20] let's start at verse 16.
[16:24] Psalms 118.
[16:26] we're going to start at verse 16.
[16:31] the right hand of the Lord is exalted
[16:34] the right hand of the Lord doeth
[16:36] valiantly
[16:38] foreign
[16:47] he had not given me over unto death
[16:57] of the Lord
[16:59] this gift of the Lord into which the
[17:01] righteous shall enter
[17:08] the stone which the builders refused is
[17:10] become The Headstone of the corner
[17:13] all right
[17:18] this is the day which the Lord hath made
[17:20] we will rejoice and be glad in it
[17:29] bless be he that cometh in the name of
[17:32] the Lord we have blessed you out of the
[17:34] house of the Lord
[17:45] Thou Art my God and I will praise thee
[17:48] Thou Art my God and I will exalt thee
[17:51] give thanks unto the Lord for he is good
[17:54] for his mercy and Earth forever God
[17:57] bless you may be seated brother Brian
[18:11] brothers and sisters
[18:13] aren't you glad that he did become that
[18:16] Cornerstone that we read in that Psalm
[18:18] if you would turn with me to uh
[18:21] Proverbs the second chapter
[18:32] I told Pete on Friday that he could tell
[18:34] on me but he said he wouldn't do it so
[18:37] you might want to ask him what I'm
[18:39] talking about you know as you get older
[18:41] you can get frustrated real easy
[18:48] you know but you can't hide sometimes
[18:50] you you know that's the thing about
[18:51] being a Christian you know sometimes you
[18:53] make mistakes if you um before I read
[18:56] the second
[18:58] Proverbs I was going to read something
[19:00] out of Timothy the fourth chapter
[19:03] and then jump back into Proverbs you
[19:06] know I've said before I've I mean I've
[19:08] done I've been
[19:09] teaching Sunday school for many years
[19:11] and I know I didn't out of Psalms and
[19:14] Proverbs did the chapter studies but and
[19:17] one of the things I said this is years
[19:19] ago
[19:20] it's just like uh every day you have a
[19:23] proverb or every day or every part of
[19:26] the year you have a gospel that you read
[19:28] a chapter from every day of the year but
[19:31] Proverbs is one of those books if you
[19:33] read a chapter a day
[19:35] and you keep going back you can see the
[19:37] wisdom of 4 000 years ago it's the same
[19:40] wisdom of today and that's the thing
[19:42] about human beings you know our
[19:44] technology might change but like brother
[19:47] random thought in the scriptures teach
[19:49] that nature in man that never changed
[19:52] just the tools that he has at any given
[19:54] time he can do more to himself than he
[19:57] could have done maybe a couple of
[19:59] thousand years ago but I'll just read a
[20:01] few of these verses here in Timothy the
[20:04] second Timothy the fourth chapter
[20:06] and I this is what Paul had to say to
[20:10] Timothy I charged he therefore before
[20:12] God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[20:15] judge the quick and the dead and
[20:17] disappearing in his kingdom and I know
[20:20] we all looked at that day coming
[20:22] but he tells Timothy here to preach the
[20:24] word the instant in season and out of
[20:28] season
[20:29] so basically he's telling Timothy
[20:31] whether whatever you're doing in season
[20:34] or out of season you need to be the same
[20:36] person you need to be consistent in
[20:38] everything you do and he goes on to
[20:41] reprove rebuke the jar with all
[20:44] long-suffering and Doctrine
[20:46] for the time this is the and this is
[20:48] actually speaking today for the day and
[20:50] you know everyone says well this is the
[20:53] day he was speaking of and I in my heart
[20:56] I might say that but only God knows what
[20:59] day this day is but when you see all the
[21:01] signs around us you know we're getting
[21:03] close to that day and he says
[21:06] and he says for the time of come well
[21:08] they will not endure sound Doctrine but
[21:12] after their own love shall Heap to
[21:14] themselves teachers that have engineers
[21:16] and that's where we're at today in the
[21:19] world and in the church World they were
[21:21] in that's they people don't want the
[21:23] truth they want to be told alive so they
[21:26] can live their lives the way they want
[21:28] to live them and it goes on and and they
[21:30] shall turn away their ears from the
[21:32] truth and shall be turned on the Fables
[21:34] the watch thou and all things and he
[21:37] this is Paul's giving him something
[21:39] letting him know no matter what the
[21:41] world is doing no matter what the church
[21:43] might be doing he's giving him a time to
[21:46] watch all things and endure afflictions
[21:48] do the work of an evangelist and make
[21:51] full proof of thy Ministry
[21:54] and then he goes Paul's talking about
[21:56] what's about to happen to him how he's
[21:58] going to finish the course and you don't
[22:01] have to be a preacher you don't have to
[22:02] be a great man of God
[22:05] but God gives you even as a father or as
[22:08] a mother whatever you do in life he
[22:10] gives you your own Ministry and you got
[22:12] to be faithful and whatever God has put
[22:14] you on this faith of Earth to be what
[22:17] and whether it's just to be a father a
[22:20] worker whatever it is you got to be
[22:21] faithful in that just as much as any man
[22:23] that's standing on this pulpr you still
[22:25] have to be faithful in what God has
[22:27] given you to do and jumping back here to
[22:30] uh
[22:32] Proverbs the second chapter
[22:36] you know these first four chapters and
[22:38] Proverbs there's a I mean there's all
[22:40] the wisdom of God is in this in Proverbs
[22:43] but uh
[22:45] in these uh 22 verses here there's a lot
[22:47] of wisdom too let me read a few of them
[22:51] you know that what in my in my life the
[22:53] way I am if I as I read the scripture
[22:56] as you continually put it before God and
[22:59] before yourself as you read the
[23:02] scripture God will teach you and show
[23:04] you the things in it you've got to read
[23:06] it though you've got to study it though
[23:08] for that to happen and it goes to say my
[23:10] son if thou will receive my words and
[23:13] hide my Commandments with thee
[23:16] and that's not the only time that verse
[23:19] is mentioned in the Bible the verb might
[23:21] come before the noun or it might be
[23:23] changed in a certain way but the truth
[23:25] is still the same it's consistent
[23:28] throughout the Bible and it says so
[23:30] Valentine thy ear unto wisdom and apply
[23:33] thy heart onto understanding
[23:35] so he's telling the people in this
[23:38] proverb that you have to be open both in
[23:40] your heart and in your mind to receive
[23:42] the truth as it's given to you yea if
[23:44] thou crys out the knowledge and lift is
[23:46] up thy voice for understanding have thou
[23:50] seekest her silver and searches for hers
[23:53] hit treasure so the truth of God is like
[23:56] a physical thing it's like gold or
[23:58] silver
[23:59] though it's received in the heart it's a
[24:02] physical thing in your heart that you
[24:04] can receive and he goes on to say I lost
[24:06] my place I hope I don't do that a lot
[24:08] then thou shall understand the fear of
[24:11] the Lord and to find the knowledge of
[24:13] God so the whole thing here Solomon is
[24:16] saying
[24:17] you're not a amoeba as a Christian you
[24:21] have to search that you just don't you
[24:23] just don't exist you have to you have to
[24:25] search for it you got to strive for the
[24:27] truth of God and for your Christian
[24:28] experience and he goes on to say for God
[24:31] giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh
[24:34] knowledge and understanding he layeth up
[24:36] sound wisdom for the righteous he is a
[24:39] buffalo
[24:40] drop rightly a buckler or a shield you
[24:43] know that your face you're sealed your
[24:45] trust in the Living God that's the
[24:47] shield that's what actually you hide
[24:49] behind and I just lost my place again he
[24:52] keepeth the paths of judgment he
[24:54] deserves the way of his Saints
[24:56] Thou shalt Thou shalt thou understand
[24:59] righteousness and judgment and equity
[25:02] yay every good path when wisdom enter
[25:05] into thine heart knowledge is Pleasant
[25:07] onto the thy soul
[25:09] and I was just thinking of this word
[25:11] here this morning discretion shall
[25:13] preserve thee understanding shall keep
[25:16] thee to deliver thee from the way of the
[25:19] evil man and from the man to speak it
[25:21] Forward things and I was just thinking
[25:23] of that
[25:24] that word this morning discretion and I
[25:27] I have a a exhaustive dictionary and it
[25:31] has you know any any noun or verbal noun
[25:35] like this will have numerous different
[25:37] meanings depending on how you use it in
[25:40] language but the synonyms of this word
[25:43] are prudence
[25:45] weariness and
[25:47] circumspection okay forgive my
[25:49] pronunciations this morning
[25:51] but I was just thinking every believer
[25:55] really needs and this day that's the one
[25:58] virtue but one thing that's missing in
[26:00] the world today is discretion the way
[26:02] you interact with people the way you
[26:04] interact with your family whoever
[26:06] discretion and I wrote down some things
[26:09] some thoughts
[26:11] this morning as I was
[26:13] reading that and I was reading this
[26:15] chapter this morning and going back to
[26:17] Timothy
[26:18] you know prudence
[26:20] the one you can't be have discretion
[26:22] biblical discretion you can't possess
[26:24] that virtue
[26:26] if you're a gospel it's impossible you
[26:29] don't have discretion if you're a
[26:30] gospeler and I'm only thinking of myself
[26:32] this morning you you can it's impossible
[26:35] if you're telling everybody everything
[26:37] about everybody there's no way you can
[26:40] have discretion that's impossible and uh
[26:43] the uh and that's and Prudence is would
[26:47] keep you from doing you're prudent with
[26:49] what you know and how you apply the
[26:51] things that you do know and I'm just
[26:54] gonna jump back in my Bible here
[26:56] I hope I have the right spot here
[27:01] I might not have the right Prudence I
[27:04] was just going to read some things about
[27:06] prudence and I might have lost my place
[27:08] I'll just keep with the thought that I
[27:11] have right now but I was also thinking
[27:12] if I wrote some other things
[27:15] part of that is tact you know as a
[27:18] military guy that's one of the virtues
[27:20] they try to be to be tactful in
[27:22] everything you do but
[27:25] basically being tactful is only saying
[27:28] the thing that needs to be said at that
[27:30] time and not all the other garbage and
[27:33] Medusa that you might think you need to
[27:35] say but it's being on point and only
[27:38] saying what needs to be said in a small
[27:40] way at that time that's tactfulness
[27:42] people don't need to hear everything
[27:44] else all they need to hear is a simple
[27:46] point that you're trying to make and the
[27:49] other thing is always weighing your
[27:51] actions and everything that you're gonna
[27:53] do or think about you're going to do you
[27:56] can't have discretion if you're not that
[27:58] way you've got to weigh your actions and
[28:01] see what they're going to bring about
[28:02] basically you got to be the kind of
[28:04] person or believer that thinks before
[28:07] they ask you know there's a lot of
[28:10] people in the grave this morning that
[28:12] didn't think before they acted they just
[28:14] they just went out and did something
[28:16] without having all the facts about what
[28:18] they were doing
[28:19] and don't believe everything people tell
[28:22] you Prudence tact awareness all these
[28:25] things don't believe uh doesn't mean you
[28:27] you don't believe people but you have to
[28:30] prove everything someone tells you or
[28:32] everything you're reading you got to
[28:34] prove it you got to back it up with
[28:35] something more than just what someone's
[28:37] telling you
[28:39] and uh you get the one the hardest thing
[28:42] for a Christian I'll finish with this
[28:43] point that comes out of this proverb I
[28:46] know this is a hard thing for everybody
[28:48] it's it's a it's Human Nature
[28:51] and sometimes you just got to let people
[28:53] have their opinions whether you agree
[28:55] with their opinion or not you just got
[28:58] you just got to let people have their
[29:00] opinion if you talk to someone and you
[29:02] stay on point and are tactful
[29:05] and they don't agree with you and you
[29:07] got to allow them to have their opinion
[29:09] you can't force them to believe like you
[29:12] do or act like you do or maybe do
[29:14] something like you do you sometimes you
[29:17] just you got to be willing to just
[29:20] let go and let people have their own way
[29:22] sometimes if you because you'll wind up
[29:24] in your life fussing with everything
[29:26] you're dealing with if you don't have
[29:28] and I was thinking about that this
[29:30] morning his discretion I that's the one
[29:33] thing people out there in the world
[29:34] should don't have this discretion I mean
[29:37] they
[29:38] they just can't keep their mouth shut
[29:40] they have to say something about
[29:41] everything but God wants prudent people
[29:44] in this bayonets that we live in Brother
[29:47] David
[29:54] amen God bless you it's good to be in
[29:57] the house of the Lord this morning

[54:29] this week of course most you know I'm
[54:32] like brother Joe and brother
[54:36] Austin We're in the junk business and I
[54:38] was holding a now as a transmission it
[54:41] weighed I don't know 150 pounds and that
[54:43] shouldn't be that big of a thing but I
[54:46] went to put it in a box and
[54:49] and uh I dropped it and you can guess
[54:52] where it landed on my right foot
[54:56] and uh where I was at the guys go are
[54:59] you okay and I said well I had
[55:01] steel-toed boots on and put a gash in
[55:04] the top of my boot
[55:06] and I thought well Lord
[55:07] it really did smart
[55:10] I thought I guess I better sit down and
[55:12] look at it and I pulled off my boot and
[55:15] of course my sock was no longer white it
[55:18] was red
[55:20] and I thought oh Lord here we go
[55:23] so I looked at it and
[55:26] didn't look too pretty and
[55:28] put my sock back on and put my boot back
[55:30] on and I said I'll be all right I'll be
[55:32] okay
[55:33] I was fixing to go home they said we got
[55:35] Band-Aids I said I'm good I'm good
[55:38] and by faith I said I'm good
[55:40] and uh
[55:42] so later on that night and after I'd got
[55:45] home and I went about my way and
[55:48] I still hard-headed brother Brian I
[55:50] thought well I'll be okay till I get
[55:51] home

[55:54] my sock and
[55:56] my wife seen my foot and

[56:26] not much red and if I bump it it bleeds
[56:29] but I said Thank You Lord

[1:07:22] we just want to announce that we do have
[1:07:23] this land sold amen we do not have
[1:07:26] didn't quite get as much as what uh we
[1:07:28] had hoped for but you normally you
[1:07:31] probably don't but we still I feel like
[1:07:32] we did get a good price for it it was
[1:07:34] around around 6 000 acre I think it is
[1:07:37] so we got 36 000 and uh Larry the guy
[1:07:41] over here does the window tinting I mean
[1:07:44] he kind of fell in love with it and he
[1:07:46] uh he made an offer and that trustee
[1:07:48] board and Deacon board we all agreed to
[1:07:50] go ahead and take that for it amen and
[1:07:53] so we appreciate the Lord doing for us
[1:07:55] amen selling for us and we'll be taking
[1:07:58] care of some of those details in the

[1:08:06] thank you Lord
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:12] certainly I do know that uh the way that
[1:08:16] it went a little bit is
[1:08:18] um he had talked about given as an
[1:08:21] easement and so when he didn't he gave
[1:08:24] us a low offer and uh I didn't really
[1:08:27] want to take that offer so I went and I
[1:08:29] talked with going to talk to him about
[1:08:30] the easement you know and I guess him
[1:08:33] and his dad had gotten together and they
[1:08:35] were worried about what was going to
[1:08:36] happen back there so amen and they don't
[1:08:38] they don't know they said we don't know
[1:08:40] what's happened but they said they want
[1:08:41] to take another look at it so they did
[1:08:44] and
[1:08:44] they really liked it
[1:08:46] and he said he was very very serious
[1:08:49] about this time and of course I seen him
[1:08:50] driving over several times but uh so I
[1:08:53] don't think we have to worry if
[1:08:54] anybody's going to be very careful about
[1:08:56] what comes there he's going to be more
[1:08:58] careful not probably even we would have
[1:09:00] been so amen amen we're just thankful
[1:09:02] that it's that way amen
[1:09:04] amen let's pray
[1:09:06] kind Heavenly Father we come before you
[1:09:08] Lord Jesus and we just want to thank you
[1:09:10] Lord for the atmosphere Lord that we
[1:09:12] feel we feel your presence is here Lord

[1:09:16] can have Lord is for you to be with us

[1:10:16] so forth and the Lord really liked it
[1:10:18] and amen and they got a victory because
[1:10:21] of it and I believe that was where the
[1:10:24] prophet of God talked about in the
[1:10:25] ultimate Testament they used to sing
[1:10:27] songs before going into battle they kind
[1:10:29] of typed the church you know here we
[1:10:31] sing songs before we go into battle amen
[1:10:34] amen and trust God will give us a
[1:10:36] victory this morning
[1:10:38] amen it's after praying diligently and
[1:10:40] seeking the Lord and just seeing what he
[1:10:42] want me to have there was a certain
[1:10:43] thought that I kind of had but uh it
[1:10:46] just felt like the Lord led me back to
[1:10:48] something that we spoke on last week and
[1:10:52] kind of just took that little thought
[1:10:53] and I feel like he blessed it and so we
[1:10:56] want to speak on it so if you will we
[1:10:58] man we'll go to Matthew amen Matthew 6
[1:11:02] and we want to read one part of the
[1:11:04] scripture or we'll read one scripture
[1:11:06] there and then we'll
[1:11:07] I'm going to go back to Second
[1:11:09] Chronicles I've really it just seems
[1:11:12] like sometimes God will anoint
[1:11:14] certain books in a special way I don't
[1:11:16] know if you ever have
[1:11:18] that happened to you but there'll be a
[1:11:20] certain certain book or something you
[1:11:22] just can't get away from it and you're
[1:11:23] just you got to read it over and again
[1:11:25] and over again and so forth and that's
[1:11:27] what's happened with me kind of with
[1:11:28] second chronicles amen and the prayer of
[1:11:32] uh Solomon and so forth and then and
[1:11:36] then also as we touched on last weekend
[1:11:38] The Lord's Prayer first we want to read
[1:11:41] the first verse of the Lord's Prayer
[1:11:43] amen

[1:11:55] and verse 9 after this matter therefore
[1:11:57] pray ye Our Father which art in Heaven

[1:12:05] Father which art in Heaven Again in
[1:12:08] second chronicles we're going to pick up
[1:12:10] this in second chronicles and I never
[1:12:12] realized until I did the study on this
[1:12:15] of how many times that uh Solomon spoke
[1:12:19] on under different it was eight
[1:12:21] different times that at least that I
[1:12:22] picked up with a short study eight
[1:12:25] different times that Solomon mentions
[1:12:28] and says then hear thou from Heaven amen
[1:12:34] so second chronicles 6 and we'll begin
[1:12:37] with uh

[1:14:17] Heaven thy Dwelling Place verse 33 then
[1:14:20] hear thou from the heavens even from thy
[1:14:23] dwell to have a word of prayer you can't
[1:14:26] pray too much right anyway
[1:14:27] Lord Jesus we come before you thanking
[1:14:29] you Lord Jesus once again to be able to
[1:14:31] assemble ourselves together
[1:14:34] Lord and just asking God that your Holy
[1:14:36] Spirit would once again have the
[1:14:37] preeminence in our hearts Our Lives Lord
[1:14:39] and Lord I just feel God that you've got
[1:14:42] something special for us this morning
[1:14:43] Lord as you always do we ask God that
[1:14:46] just just bless every heart the need of
[1:14:47] every heart Lord now come and hear our
[1:14:50] prayer Lord Jesus and father come down
[1:14:52] in this special way as we already sense
[1:14:54] and already have in our prayers God that
[1:14:57] you would come Lord and anoint Lord and
[1:14:59] Let Your Presence be felt here this
[1:15:01] morning in a special way Lord we ask a
[1:15:04] blessing upon the reading of the word
[1:15:05] now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen
[1:15:09] I got to thinking about that about
[1:15:12] hearing from Heaven amen praise the Lord
[1:15:17] how many is that that we have a line we
[1:15:20] have a phone line so to speak to heaven
[1:15:24] there's a lot of people in them you know
[1:15:26] it's it's sad it I really feel bad
[1:15:29] that there are millions and billions of
[1:15:31] people out there that pray
[1:15:34] is that right
[1:15:37] yeah
[1:15:38] they're very staunch about their prayers
[1:15:40] and about about talking to their God
[1:15:44] isn't that right
[1:15:45] but a lot of them prayed Allah they pray
[1:15:48] the different ones and all kinds of
[1:15:49] different places but I mean there's only
[1:15:51] one amen that is in heaven that can
[1:15:55] answer their prayer
[1:15:57] and if you're asking the wrong person
[1:15:59] you're not going to get anything
[1:16:01] but we're trying to be tonight demand to
[1:16:04] know that when we pray we're praying to
[1:16:06] the god that is in heaven Our Father
[1:16:08] which is in heaven this morning amen I
[1:16:11] just want to title this hearing from
[1:16:13] heaven
[1:16:15] hearing from Heaven people who heard
[1:16:17] from heaven
[1:16:19] amen what a great thing it is
[1:16:23] what a great thing it is
[1:16:25] you know we had we used to work for a
[1:16:28] man
[1:16:29] by the name my guess of David Trousdale
[1:16:32] and he got into this Ham radios and so
[1:16:35] forth and you know he would tell me
[1:16:36] about all the different countries and
[1:16:38] the different languages and all the
[1:16:40] different things that he would hear and
[1:16:41] he was fascinated and spent a lot of
[1:16:43] money on this radio and putting on these
[1:16:45] antennas out and boy being excited about
[1:16:47] the next bigger bigger ham radio and
[1:16:49] this side of the other here and all
[1:16:51] these things you know
[1:16:52] you know I thought that must be
[1:16:53] intriguing Perhaps it is for a person
[1:16:55] that's into that but I had to think when
[1:16:56] I was studying on this but how much
[1:16:58] greater is it to be able to hear from
[1:17:01] heaven
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:04] Amen to be able to touch him because you
[1:17:06] know a lot of people's prayers I may
[1:17:08] know a lot of peers prayers perhaps just
[1:17:10] go as high as the ceiling I mean we
[1:17:13] don't want our prayers just to hit the
[1:17:15] ceiling and that's as high it goes
[1:17:17] because if your prayer
[1:17:20] if your prayer makes it up there and he
[1:17:23] hears it
[1:17:24] something's going to happen
[1:17:26] I already know something's gonna happen
[1:17:28] and isn't that what it's all about is
[1:17:30] having your prayer hurt
[1:17:32] had to have him to hear you from heaven
[1:17:37] because if he hears you
[1:17:39] how many knows we've heard the statement
[1:17:41] that God will bankrupt Heaven before he
[1:17:44] doesn't answer your prayer if he hears
[1:17:47] and acknowledges
[1:17:49] your prayer amen he'll get all of Heaven
[1:17:52] behind you behind him and be that and
[1:17:55] it'll happen
[1:17:57] that's what it's all about because a lot
[1:17:59] of a lot of times Sinners and I know
[1:18:01] what it's like to be a sinner and
[1:18:02] perhaps praying and praying and praying
[1:18:04] it just feel like God just doesn't hear
[1:18:06] you you just don't make it through you
[1:18:08] just don't get the baptism you're
[1:18:09] holding up you don't get saved like you
[1:18:11] want to
[1:18:13] the people try to pray and pray and pray
[1:18:16] but let me tell you something when God
[1:18:17] hears you it's all over it
[1:18:22] praise be to God
[1:18:24] why the Glorious thing
[1:18:27] to have him to hear you
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:31] praise be to God and to hear we talk
[1:18:33] about the voice of God but we're talking
[1:18:35] about the voice of God this morning
[1:18:36] because we know when you hear the voice
[1:18:38] of God it's important to hear it for you
[1:18:42] to hear it when he speaks amen
[1:18:47] amen praise the Lord
[1:18:50] I'll just take a I want to go down with
[1:18:52] the Old Testament for a little bit but
[1:18:53] you know
[1:18:54] oh you know he's talking about this that
[1:18:56] when anybody would turn their face to
[1:18:58] Arts I mean I believe it was probably
[1:18:59] God that said that even Jonah turned his
[1:19:02] face that way and he says one more time
[1:19:04] will I see this Temple and so forth he
[1:19:07] prayed to God and I don't care if you're
[1:19:09] in the bottom of the ocean in the belly
[1:19:11] of the whale when you have the right
[1:19:12] approach to God God will hear you ain't
[1:19:14] no matter how far down you are how much
[1:19:17] down in luck you are I admire you are
[1:19:19] when God hears you that sit back and see
[1:19:23] she's gonna spill you out you're gonna
[1:19:24] accomplish your mission amen
[1:19:29] no matter how deep insane a person is I
[1:19:32] don't care if you're married and you're
[1:19:33] a prostitute I don't care if you had
[1:19:35] five husbands and you're way down to the
[1:19:37] mire
[1:19:39] d
[1:19:41] if God hears you
[1:19:43] huh God here's your prayer
[1:19:46] God hears you you're in for a treat
[1:19:50] you have all of Heaven that's going to
[1:19:52] come behind you isn't that right
[1:19:55] for oh my when you think about what a
[1:19:57] privileged people we are
[1:19:59] how many believe that we're a privileged
[1:20:01] people
[1:20:02] Hallelujah
[1:20:04] Lori
[1:20:06] when we think about that not everybody's
[1:20:09] privileged to have a Heavenly Father
[1:20:10] Like You and I
[1:20:12] even the brother banham says you know
[1:20:14] the birds when they get up in the
[1:20:15] morning to have a heavenly father and
[1:20:16] they sing to the top of their voices and
[1:20:18] they're always singing and singing and
[1:20:20] singing
[1:20:21] hey man he says man he looked down from
[1:20:23] the trees and they see people walking
[1:20:25] gloomy and sad and all tore up isn't
[1:20:28] that right he says they must not have a
[1:20:30] Heavenly Father like what we do
[1:20:34] to take care of them he's got an
[1:20:37] All-Seeing Eye that's watching you
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:44] amen praise be to God Amen
[1:20:48] he'll hear from the heavens of heavens
[1:20:52] if you'll notice I like this
[1:20:56] If my people which are called by my name
[1:20:58] shall humble themselves and pray and
[1:21:00] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[1:21:02] way then will I hear from heaven
[1:21:06] now this actually goes over into the New
[1:21:08] Testament already and I want to just
[1:21:10] cover some of the old but you know that
[1:21:11] comes up and that matches up with Acts 2
[1:21:14] 38.
[1:21:16] how many knows that acts 2 38 whenever
[1:21:20] Peter was preaching to Israel and it's
[1:21:22] all looking about how that they have
[1:21:23] with Wicked hands they can and crucified
[1:21:26] the Lord of Glory and the Bible says
[1:21:28] that they were pricked in their hearts
[1:21:30] and they said man and brother what must
[1:21:32] we
[1:21:34] uh and what did Peter say that repent
[1:21:36] every one of you
[1:21:38] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:21:40] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:21:41] sins and
[1:21:43] go hear your prayer
[1:21:46] for
[1:21:48] I want you to know you can repent all
[1:21:50] you want you can do all this down or the
[1:21:51] other in yourself but until God accepts
[1:21:54] your repentance until he looks down in
[1:21:57] your heart and he sees that you really
[1:21:59] mean that you mean to give you his your
[1:22:01] life completely
[1:22:03] funny
[1:22:05] sees that he'll answer with what how
[1:22:07] will he answer he will answer you with
[1:22:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:12] probably God said when you are a genuine
[1:22:14] repentance and it's genuine God is
[1:22:16] obligated and you ain't gotta wait and
[1:22:18] carry for a bunch of days and she'll
[1:22:21] give it to you right there then he'll
[1:22:23] answer you
[1:22:27] aren't you glad for that
[1:22:29] he'll answer your repentance with the
[1:22:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:34] oh my
[1:22:37] God praise be to God
[1:22:41] oh Hallelujah God is good is it what
[1:22:43] about Jehoshaphat remember many times
[1:22:45] and many times in viable times when a
[1:22:48] king or a leader would humble themselves
[1:22:50] and say man we can't come against his
[1:22:52] army they're like the sand of the sea we
[1:22:54] have no chance against them but God we
[1:22:56] need your help
[1:22:59] whenever God answered let me tell you
[1:23:01] something the whole Army was just
[1:23:03] crying without them doing anything they
[1:23:06] killed each other when God answers
[1:23:09] great things happen when God answers
[1:23:12] the presence of God comes out when God
[1:23:14] answers
[1:23:16] that's what we need
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:20] how many knows we need answered prayers
[1:23:23] we need God to hear it doesn't do any
[1:23:25] good if you don't hear
[1:23:29] doesn't do a bit of good
[1:23:32] why do you think our prophet and our
[1:23:34] generation was so close to God hello
[1:23:36] he says if you'll get the people that
[1:23:38] believe not even cancer well it's
[1:23:39] nothing will stand in your way
[1:23:42] amen nothing will stand in your
[1:23:45] wait
[1:23:47] amen and about everything he prayed for
[1:23:49] God would answer him or tell him no or
[1:23:51] whatever it is but most of the time it
[1:23:53] would happen wouldn't it
[1:23:55] Hallelujah
[1:23:57] we think about Daniel let's think about
[1:23:59] Daniel for just a minute
[1:24:01] how many knows he played a lot
[1:24:03] he committed himself to God
[1:24:06] and God heard
[1:24:09] his prayer
[1:24:10] when God heard
[1:24:12] he didn't just send an angel down to
[1:24:14] protect man you know but God says you
[1:24:17] know it must have been the pillar of
[1:24:18] fire that showed up it must have been
[1:24:19] God that showed up and then scared those
[1:24:22] lines because they're afraid of fire and
[1:24:24] they protect Nathaniel the whole night
[1:24:27] when God answers
[1:24:30] the enemies are destroyed three more
[1:24:33] children they trusted in their God they
[1:24:35] prayed to God they trusted it almighty
[1:24:37] God and they had communicated God's seen
[1:24:40] their faith
[1:24:41] he saw it and he says I'll go down
[1:24:43] myself until the king said then did we
[1:24:46] sinned we did we put three men in there
[1:24:49] I see four men God was so proud of them
[1:24:52] he answered by coming down himself
[1:24:55] that's the prophet of God said wormwood
[1:24:57] a water Angel and all of this wind Angel
[1:25:00] I'll blow it off I'll water that place
[1:25:02] down they'll put that seventh fold more
[1:25:05] fire out in no time
[1:25:08] I said no no no no no no no no
[1:25:11] no no just stay your place one more just
[1:25:13] stay in your place this one that one he
[1:25:15] says now you said he whipped up a cloud
[1:25:18] and stepped on the clock Who's down in
[1:25:20] there drop down and said let's go
[1:25:24] I did that they were walking around in
[1:25:26] the fire
[1:25:28] and today we're probably dancing around
[1:25:31] all right that's what happens when God
[1:25:34] comes down you walk around I don't get
[1:25:37] what it is we have problems in your
[1:25:38] heart trials and then when you know God
[1:25:40] is in you can shout and praise God
[1:25:42] anyway
[1:25:45] amen as long as he's in the fire
[1:25:48] when God answers he's in the fire
[1:25:51] um
[1:25:52] let me tell you something God is worthy
[1:25:55] of our praise
[1:25:56] he's a great God
[1:25:59] and he should be praised greatly amen
[1:26:03] Hallelujah I like that don't you
[1:26:06] Hallelujah whenever what was it Samson
[1:26:09] one time
[1:26:12] he had backslid give it away a secret he
[1:26:15] was in the pit of backsliddenness
[1:26:19] he was in despair of getting away from
[1:26:22] God
[1:26:24] blind
[1:26:26] jammed his eyes out
[1:26:28] both of them he couldn't see a thing

[1:28:42] pillars he felt them pillars right
[1:28:45] must have been just enough room brother
[1:28:47] man
[1:28:49] to push
[1:28:52] [Laughter]
[1:28:56] them things come down on all the pillars
[1:28:58] on the whole house that
[1:29:00] huh I see them fancy dress women and
[1:29:03] fancy dressed men flinging over the
[1:29:05] balconies and falling down and the
[1:29:07] building come crashing down let me die
[1:29:09] with my enemies but let me feel your
[1:29:11] power again
[1:29:12] huh
[1:29:14] took out more than than he ever did why
[1:29:17] he'd have never done it if God didn't
[1:29:19] hear him
[1:29:20] he just stayed humility humiliated the
[1:29:23] rest of his days
[1:29:24] but when God hears God heard from heaven
[1:29:28] and all the powers
[1:29:32] amen how many knows
[1:29:34] it takes Angels it takes a power to make
[1:29:37] that happen in the other dimension
[1:29:39] is that right
[1:29:41] Angels no doubt caught onto them pillars
[1:29:43] and pushed it huh
[1:29:45] pushed it over
[1:29:47] amen why because we know that angels are
[1:29:51] camped around all over the place
[1:29:53] I mean they're there to Bible and fight
[1:29:55] for us
[1:29:56] to watch out for us
[1:29:58] amen
[1:30:00] praise be to God maybe I'll just mention
[1:30:02] the story y'all remember Elisha right
[1:30:06] amen Elisha and Elijah
[1:30:08] amen and syrians come down the Assyrians
[1:30:11] come up against Israel
[1:30:15] the prophet went over and told the king
[1:30:18] of Israel
[1:30:19] where they were going to camp at
[1:30:21] and then the Syrian King says you know
[1:30:23] can't y'all man can't y'all tell us who
[1:30:27] in our camp is against us
[1:30:29] we've got to trade her somewhere
[1:30:32] and his leader said no we don't have a
[1:30:34] trainer but Elijah I'm telling you he
[1:30:36] tells the king what you say in your bad
[1:30:39] Chambers
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:43] Glory
[1:30:45] he says well what can we do where is he
[1:30:48] and guess what they found out where he
[1:30:50] was and they surrounded the city
[1:30:53] remember they surrounded the city and
[1:30:55] his servant said man what are we going
[1:30:57] to do
[1:30:58] what are we gonna do
[1:31:03] oh my Elijah said you know just hang in
[1:31:06] there
[1:31:07] right
[1:31:11] opened his eyes
[1:31:13] and he opened his eyes and there was
[1:31:14] chariots everywhere
[1:31:17] and then Elijah prayed and he said you
[1:31:20] know God blind strike him with blindness
[1:31:23] is that right and he struck him blind
[1:31:25] and you talk about I thought back there
[1:31:27] when I was studying on this you talk
[1:31:29] about it put a spell on people
[1:31:32] they they you know he went out there and
[1:31:34] he says Hey the man that you're looking
[1:31:36] for I know where he is
[1:31:38] and uh I'll lead you to him and that
[1:31:41] whole Army followed the prophet all the
[1:31:43] way to Samaria
[1:31:46] and when they got to Samaria the father
[1:31:49] prayed said now open up his eye open up
[1:31:51] all of their eyes and they opened
[1:31:53] open up this realize they're right in
[1:31:55] the middle of the enemies Camp they had
[1:31:57] to surrender
[1:31:58] the server says should I kill them all
[1:32:00] no he said don't they're your captives
[1:32:03] put bread and food before him huh
[1:32:07] but what is the point to point is
[1:32:09] remember he opened his eyes to see over
[1:32:11] into that dimension
[1:32:13] how many knows there's seven dimensions
[1:32:16] brother bam taught us there's seven
[1:32:17] different dimensions three of them is uh
[1:32:19] time matter and space I believe it is
[1:32:21] which what we live in the fourth is of
[1:32:24] course the uh radio and television
[1:32:26] they've proven through science it's all
[1:32:28] of that is going through here they're
[1:32:30] right then they also said that even
[1:32:32] cancer was a fourth dimensional disease
[1:32:35] even demons there in that fourth
[1:32:37] dimension
[1:32:38] demons and so forth that fourth
[1:32:40] dimension what a terrible thing and then
[1:32:42] The Fifth Dimension is a region of the
[1:32:44] loss
[1:32:45] a place that you go to by the band said
[1:32:47] and I've got it here he says you know
[1:32:48] it's a place of the Lord I mean it's
[1:32:50] like a nightmare you can't go to heaven
[1:32:52] and you can't come back you're just
[1:32:53] stuck there
[1:32:55] huh
[1:32:56] sixth dimensional bam he says that's
[1:32:58] where I've seen when I went to a
[1:33:00] division sixth Dimension is saved
[1:33:03] but the Sabbath is the heavens of the
[1:33:06] Hills
[1:33:07] see when God answers he answers you from
[1:33:09] that dementia
[1:33:11] oh mine how many knows each and every
[1:33:13] one of us is either influenced by that
[1:33:16] demonic Dimension or influenced and
[1:33:18] inspired this morning by that higher
[1:33:21] Dimension the seventh Dimension the
[1:33:23] Mansion of God
[1:33:25] praise be to God
[1:33:27] we're drawing our strength from one of
[1:33:29] those
[1:33:31] amen I thought you know it's so
[1:33:32] important
[1:33:34] foreign
[1:33:36] it's so important
[1:33:38] that we have an atmosphere and a home
[1:33:44] the reason kids don't turn out right is
[1:33:46] because parents haven't drawn enough of
[1:33:49] that atmosphere down in their own
[1:33:52] remember this your kids growing up they
[1:33:54] need to have an atmosphere of the Holy
[1:33:56] Ghost
[1:33:57] how do you expect them ever to turn out
[1:33:59] if they aren't under the atmosphere of
[1:34:01] the Holy Spirit
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:04] man and that comes through prayer that
[1:34:06] comes through Dedication that every
[1:34:07] parent has to ask themselves what kind
[1:34:09] of atmosphere am I creating in my home
[1:34:11] amen what kind of children are are my
[1:34:14] children going to turn out to be
[1:34:16] they should be able to say Daddy I want
[1:34:18] what you have mommy
[1:34:20] you're gonna say Mommy I want what you
[1:34:22] have I want the joy that you have
[1:34:25] you got fighting and bickering and I
[1:34:27] ever have no peace and they're all kind
[1:34:28] of Chaos in your house
[1:34:30] huh they would want to live in that kind
[1:34:32] of Dimension they'll know or in that
[1:34:35] kind of atmosphere
[1:34:36] Lord help us this morning you pull from
[1:34:39] that out of their atmosphere that's why
[1:34:40] I may believe that even when we come to
[1:34:42] church we come to church early to pray
[1:34:44] to create that atmosphere to pull God
[1:34:47] down
[1:34:48] hallelujah amen
[1:34:51] oh you love that or what
[1:34:53] many different things you think about
[1:34:55] the power the power we're talking about

[1:35:04] there's right now the lid has come off
[1:35:06] of hell Friday

[1:36:04] I hate to say it and you shouldn't pick
[1:36:06] on people but even if there was a
[1:36:07] boy in our school a lot of times he'd
[1:36:09] get picked out as being a little

[1:36:33] my my mind
[1:36:35] now look at where we are successful the
[1:36:38] very Cesspool of sin where he says full
[1:36:41] of hell has belched out
[1:36:44] it opened itself up demons flying
[1:36:47] everywhere brother man said

[1:37:24] all the gates of hell have opened up
[1:37:27] the windows of Heaven have opened up
[1:37:31] that has poured itself out
[1:37:34] today don't read the word of God that
[1:37:39] to know who you are where you come from
[1:37:41] who your dad is what genetics you're off
[1:37:45] to tell you who you were from what your

[1:37:59] of God
[1:38:01] praise be to God
[1:38:04] amen
[1:38:06] listen
[1:38:08] we think of all these things all these
[1:38:10] Old Testament people
[1:38:12] who call God down hello God did these
[1:38:16] marvelous things for him
[1:38:18] but one thing he could never do was what
[1:38:22] he could never become one with him
[1:38:25] he could give him the baptism he could
[1:38:27] give him a a you know like Samson and
[1:38:30] different ones he could give him the
[1:38:31] measure of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:35] to do things and so forth but you could
[1:38:36] never change their nature
[1:38:39] he could never dwell there because it
[1:38:41] was unfit place
[1:38:44] this is what the prophet of God said
[1:38:46] listen
[1:38:47] when God came down in the form of a dove
[1:38:50] and lit upon the lamb and Abode on the
[1:38:52] lamb and never did leave the lamb for
[1:38:54] they were one that was one of the
[1:38:56] greatest events that the world has ever
[1:38:59] had
[1:39:01] ah
[1:39:02] just look at that for a minute
[1:39:04] but how did the heavens and earth
[1:39:07] Embrace each other
[1:39:11] now we've got the heavens of Heavens
[1:39:13] coming down and embracing the Earth

[1:39:35] reconciled to get together amen
[1:39:39] praise be to God
[1:39:40] so heavens and earth when he came

[1:39:44] that when you receive is the baptism of
[1:39:47] the Holy Ghost that is God coming down
[1:39:50] and embracing you just like David said
[1:39:52] Embrace him he's embracing you
[1:39:58] and there's very few things in this
[1:40:00] world
[1:40:01] that's better than the good embrace
[1:40:05] huh
[1:40:06] a good embrace it shows love there's no
[1:40:09] animosity there's just pure love there
[1:40:12] a real good hug a real Embrace let me
[1:40:15] tell you something to me there's nothing
[1:40:17] that ever has happened in my life better
[1:40:19] than when God come into my heart and

[1:40:26] God in my eye became one
[1:40:31] praise be to God
[1:40:33] Hallelujah
[1:40:35] how many knows God uses the fivefold
[1:40:38] ministry now to speak to
[1:40:41] you can use my voice this morning
[1:40:43] and say something that you would have
[1:40:45] never expected me to say
[1:40:47] you didn't see it coming but yet it
[1:40:49] spoke right to your heart
[1:40:52] huh
[1:40:53] God speaks through the FireFold Ministry
[1:40:56] let me tell you he don't just speak to
[1:40:57] them but he speaks to every born again
[1:41:00] son and daughter of God you now have the
[1:41:03] voice of God
[1:41:05] said the bride is the final voice to the
[1:41:08] final age
[1:41:09] God's Prophet was here in his word was
[1:41:11] the say of the Lord he had the voice of
[1:41:14] God
[1:41:18] amen
[1:41:20] praise be to God let's talk about
[1:41:22] another portion of Heaven something else
[1:41:24] in heaven
[1:41:28] Amen in order for you to actually hear
[1:41:31] the voice of God because even Jesus said
[1:41:34] blessed are you your ears
[1:41:36] that can hear isn't that right
[1:41:39] not everybody
[1:41:41] can hear
[1:41:44] Jesus how many knows when Jesus was on
[1:41:46] Earth he was the voice of God
[1:41:48] every word to come out of his mouth was
[1:41:51] the voice of God it was God's voice
[1:41:55] everything he said
[1:41:57] was God speaking
[1:41:58] amen
[1:42:00] and describes the Pharisees take
[1:42:02] couldn't
[1:42:04] receive it they didn't receive it
[1:42:06] They didn't accept it
[1:42:10] they refused it they said this beelzibar
[1:42:13] a fortune teller
[1:42:15] but he came to a woman at the well isn't
[1:42:18] that right
[1:42:21] and she had had five husbands
[1:42:26] and yet whenever he began to give her
[1:42:29] the water that he was talking about he
[1:42:31] said the water did I give you if I give
[1:42:32] you this water
[1:42:33] it'll be last everlasting life springing
[1:42:36] up into everlasting life she says she
[1:42:39] didn't say well you must be a fortune
[1:42:40] teller
[1:42:42] no she said give me this water
[1:42:45] everybody Sons and Daughters of God said
[1:42:46] give me this water
[1:42:48] they hear the voice of God
[1:42:50] amen
[1:42:52] now listen so he says look at this
[1:42:54] little woman she had fallen from God's
[1:42:56] thought she could be redeemed she was a
[1:42:58] subject she had representation in heaven
[1:43:02] amen
[1:43:04] what a difference between her and those
[1:43:06] preachers oh my she said she could teach
[1:43:09] Birmingham something she could teach the
[1:43:11] rest of the world something yes sir she
[1:43:14] could teach the Theological Seminary
[1:43:16] something that he's the same yesterday
[1:43:17] today and forever
[1:43:20] Christ could come and did come and did
[1:43:22] the very same things to our prophet
[1:43:25] yes is that right very same things how
[1:43:29] many knows that a prophet is a seer
[1:43:32] he sees God's will he sees God's plan he
[1:43:36] can do whatever God wants him to do and
[1:43:37] that's why when we lost love to God as
[1:43:40] he Prophet on that measure we lost a
[1:43:43] great thing
[1:43:45] there's a lot of people that wants to be
[1:43:47] a prophet and this that or the other but
[1:43:48] that don't make him a prophet
[1:43:51] ah whenever I see people trying to do
[1:43:53] that I realize that's counterfeit that
[1:43:56] ain't right
[1:43:57] I don't say that there's my prophets
[1:43:59] hello there can be Minor Prophets but if
[1:44:01] you are a minor Prophet believe me
[1:44:03] you'll be you'll be what God made you it
[1:44:05] won't be no gimmick or put on it'll be
[1:44:08] real
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:11] but he could see he could he had he had
[1:44:13] so many Visions he could see God's will
[1:44:17] so much until he had the time to go out
[1:44:19] in the mountains sometimes and get away
[1:44:21] from some of the visions and so forth is
[1:44:22] that what he did
[1:44:25] buddies if you remember he got that says
[1:44:28] well because God show you Visions like
[1:44:29] that out here
[1:44:30] now forget just what it was but it
[1:44:33] uh but a brother he told him what he was
[1:44:35] there for you know his mom and
[1:44:37] everything about him and so forth told
[1:44:39] all him about why this was on his heart
[1:44:42] he was shocked he says he does see
[1:44:44] Visions he was just that
[1:44:46] tuned with God
[1:44:49] until he could see visions
[1:44:51] he could tell things foretell things
[1:44:54] aren't we privileged today
[1:44:56] to know that very God that was back
[1:44:58] there that was in the heavens of Heaven
[1:44:59] says come now and become man come into
[1:45:02] human beings
[1:45:03] hey man aren't you thankful for that
[1:45:06] when I think about uh you know
[1:45:09] you know Acts 2 38 you know repenting
[1:45:12] and so forth in the book of Acts listen
[1:45:13] I just want to go to this
[1:45:20] but before I do let me finish this about
[1:45:22] representation
[1:45:24] how many knows that
[1:45:25] this representation
[1:45:28] brother random later on talked about how
[1:45:30] that
[1:45:33] the representation of predestination
[1:45:36] and he talked about that being our
[1:45:38] theophany hello
[1:45:40] huh can I have something up there to
[1:45:42] represent you
[1:45:46] now I've got a scripture quote here
[1:45:47] where he talks about them whenever you
[1:45:49] heard the word and whenever you receive
[1:45:51] the word of God he said you heard
[1:45:55] from your theophany
[1:46:00] all right another place he says you know

[1:46:04] thirst you have amen do you want to be
[1:46:06] better do you wanna you wanna be perfect

[1:46:16] you're from
[1:46:17] either from above or From Below either
[1:46:21] you got a theophany that you're Desiring
[1:46:23] to have and to put on because he
[1:46:26] mentions that about representation he
[1:46:28] says if we have this Earthly body be
[1:46:29] dissolved we have one already waiting a
[1:46:32] theology body over in heaven that's
[1:46:34] calling us
[1:46:36] drawing us
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:46:40] here's a good one
[1:46:43] does in little imperfections that you
[1:46:46] got in your life that you still hate so
[1:46:48] bad
[1:46:51] you don't have to raise your hand but
[1:46:54] most of us probably still have them
[1:46:56] if we're still in the flesh we still
[1:46:58] have those little imperfections those
[1:46:59] little places those maybe just
[1:47:02] not as diligent as what we should be
[1:47:06] it could be a sinful habit it could be
[1:47:09] something this Saturday or whatever it
[1:47:10] is and you just that you you know if you
[1:47:12] if it doesn't bother you
[1:47:15] you could be in trouble
[1:47:19] huh
[1:47:20] if you have a lot of faults you do
[1:47:22] things wrong and you just want to blame
[1:47:23] somebody else then blame somebody else
[1:47:25] no they did it you're trying to justify
[1:47:27] yourself
[1:47:28] you never want to look at yourself real
[1:47:30] hard and say look how I really am
[1:47:33] no that's me I need to repent I need to
[1:47:36] get right because I want you to know
[1:47:37] when you hear from your theophany when
[1:47:39] you hear God's voice in your heart the
[1:47:41] first thing you say is God I'm so sorry
[1:47:43] Lord forgive me of my sins remember my
[1:47:46] failures I'm not by the other people
[1:47:48] that's what they'll tell you are you
[1:47:50] with me this morning that's when you're
[1:47:52] really here from heaven
[1:47:54] and I believe we as Christians everybody
[1:47:55] listen this morning we as Christians
[1:47:57] this morning amen if I thirst in our
[1:47:59] hunger is to get more like Christ be
[1:48:01] granted Christians than what we are
[1:48:03] you're going the right way
[1:48:07] because I'm not up here to testify your
[1:48:09] sin and make it easy for you to sin and
[1:48:11] all of that stuff nah we're not going
[1:48:13] that way
[1:48:15] say Lord
[1:48:17] I believe I read it in one of the Psalms
[1:48:18] David says you know creating me a clean
[1:48:21] heart of God see if there be any wicked
[1:48:23] way in me Lord if this take it out Lord
[1:48:25] amen search my heart oh God
[1:48:28] Lord help us amen your theophany from
[1:48:31] Heaven calling you
[1:48:33] isn't that awesome
[1:48:36] amen your theophany
[1:48:38] calling you
[1:48:40] praise be to God
[1:48:43] what was the greatest day the greatest
[1:48:44] day was when God and man became one
[1:48:49] now how many notes that did not happen
[1:48:51] when Jesus was on Earth
[1:48:54] that was not happened when Jesus won
[1:48:56] Earth
[1:48:58] because the Holy Ghost wasn't come yet
[1:49:02] he was with God was with man
[1:49:06] but he wanted something more than that
[1:49:07] didn't he
[1:49:09] Acts 2 says when the day of Pentecost
[1:49:11] was fully come they were all with one
[1:49:14] Accord in one place
[1:49:16] amen
[1:49:17] let me let me back up let's go to
[1:49:19] chapter one
[1:49:20] and being assembled together verse 4
[1:49:22] with them commanded them that they
[1:49:25] should not depart from Jerusalem but
[1:49:27] wait for the promise of the Father which
[1:49:29] he has uh which he saith you have heard
[1:49:33] of me for John truly baptized with water
[1:49:36] but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:49:38] Ghost not many days hence and we're
[1:49:40] there when they therefore will come
[1:49:42] together to ask of him saying Lord with
[1:49:45] that this time restore again the Kingdom
[1:49:46] of Israel and he said unto them it is
[1:49:49] not for you to know the times or the
[1:49:51] season which the father hath put in his
[1:49:54] own power amen
[1:49:56] but you shall receive power after the
[1:50:01] Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:50:03] why do you think that Peter was not able
[1:50:07] he didn't have the capability to confess
[1:50:10] these and say yes I am one of them he
[1:50:13] was scared to death that he was going to
[1:50:15] die and he wasn't ready to die in a
[1:50:16] sinful State hello
[1:50:19] you see he wasn't willing to die he
[1:50:21] wouldn't want to give it they won't
[1:50:22] didn't want to he didn't want them to
[1:50:23] catch him so he lied
[1:50:25] but afterwards
[1:50:27] he said what don't crucify me like him
[1:50:30] crucify me upside down
[1:50:32] I'm not worthy to be crucified upright
[1:50:34] like he was
[1:50:40] amen
[1:50:42] Peter might have been a little bit
[1:50:44] rambunctious
[1:50:46] but I want to shake his hand when we get
[1:50:48] there whatever he did he wanted to do
[1:50:51] 150 percent
[1:50:53] yeah we have to say that about him but
[1:50:56] he was gonna do you know
[1:50:58] amen
[1:51:00] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both
[1:51:02] in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samara
[1:51:05] and then to the other most parts of the
[1:51:07] Earth this is when God and man became
[1:51:09] one suddenly it there came a sound from
[1:51:15] heaven
[1:51:16] Glory how many knows you come all the
[1:51:19] way all the way from Glory

[1:51:23] form of the Holy Ghost and when he come
[1:51:26] back it's come like a rushing Mighty
[1:51:29] Wind

[1:52:05] tongues like as a fire and it sat upon
[1:52:08] each one of them and they were all
[1:52:11] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:52:14] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:52:16] gave them utterance

[1:55:29] and everything are there but not
[1:55:30] anything created that he did not create
[1:55:32] that's who you're talking about the
[1:55:34] mighty creator

[1:55:40] no greater honor
[1:55:43] let me say this no greater feeling
[1:55:46] amen
[1:55:48] than to have fellowship with our
[1:55:49] heavenly father
[1:55:51] Hallelujah
[1:55:55] we're taught that you know man he's
[1:55:57] always waiting for God for what he did
[1:55:58] and for what he will do and some
[1:56:01] sometimes ignoring what he is doing but
[1:56:04] this morning we're talking about and
[1:56:05] praising God for what he did do
[1:56:07] and for what he is doing amen
[1:56:10] and for what he will do
[1:56:13] praise be to God
[1:56:17] how many knows that whenever the Seven
[1:56:20] Angels Came Down in Arizona brother bam
[1:56:23] says it was a huge loud thunder clap
[1:56:26] like you had never heard and he makes
[1:56:28] mention it a little later on talking
[1:56:30] about how that anything that fast any
[1:56:32] Angels traveling that far from eternity
[1:56:35] in a split in a in a thought would cause
[1:56:38] a big crack
[1:56:39] just like the pain of a sound barrier
[1:56:42] whatever he mentioned it and I was like
[1:56:44] that must be what he's talking about
[1:56:45] that challenges come from eternity in a
[1:56:48] split second boom
[1:56:51] the Rocks fell out of the mountains and
[1:56:53] everywhere everybody was ducking and
[1:56:54] getting under trucks and everything else
[1:56:56] huh
[1:56:58] and what did that voice say to brother
[1:56:59] about him he says go back to
[1:57:01] Jeffersonville because the seven uh
[1:57:03] seals are going to be opened at this
[1:57:05] time I mean believe we heard a voice
[1:57:07] from heaven
[1:57:10] I heard heard of Oz and it sounded like
[1:57:13] a scriptural voice to me
[1:57:15] amen as the Young's brother I believe it
[1:57:17] sayings when he came Seven Angels Came
[1:57:20] Down isn't that right when they went
[1:57:22] back up they formed the Hoffman's head
[1:57:25] of Christ
[1:57:27] amen so high scientists didn't know what
[1:57:29] it was nobody knew what it was but we
[1:57:31] know what it is
[1:57:35] they might deny it
[1:57:37] how many believes this will be played
[1:57:38] back on the day of judgment yeah that
[1:57:40] was me y'all that was me coming
[1:57:42] opening up the revelation of the Seven
[1:57:44] Seals and we heard a voice
[1:57:47] oh from heaven
[1:57:50] praise the lord we heard Revelations 18.
[1:57:53] after these things I saw a mighty Angel
[1:57:55] come down from heaven having great power
[1:57:57] and the Earth was lightened with his
[1:57:58] glory and he cried mightily with a
[1:58:01] strong voice saying Babylon the great is
[1:58:03] filed on this Fallen and become the
[1:58:05] habitation of devils and the hope of
[1:58:07] every foul Spirit what is Babylon
[1:58:10] confusion
[1:58:12] what is confusion 900 different churches
[1:58:15] is confusion
[1:58:17] and that Babylon fell God was not in it
[1:58:22] anymore but it became the habitation of
[1:58:25] devils
[1:58:28] amen and I dare say it the way the
[1:58:31] reason that America is in the condition
[1:58:33] that it is in is because the preachers
[1:58:36] rejected Christ
[1:58:39] the preachers the churches rejected
[1:58:41] Christ the parents rejected Christ when
[1:58:42] you reject Christ there's nothing left
[1:58:44] but chaos
[1:58:45] it let every evil thing because that's
[1:58:47] what held that's what was conservative
[1:58:48] anyway
[1:58:49] do you see that in the news the other
[1:58:51] day that uh conservative young people
[1:58:53] were reading the Bible and those
[1:58:54] leftists came and ripped at all the
[1:58:56] shreds and destroyed it and ate their
[1:58:58] pages and everything else that's How
[1:58:59] brave the devil is getting
[1:59:02] amen we're getting very bold very very
[1:59:04] vocal amen and that's what he's gotten
[1:59:07] do
[1:59:08] amen every foul spirit in the cage of
[1:59:11] every unclean hateful bird for all
[1:59:13] nations have drunk of the wine of the
[1:59:15] wrath of her fornication and the kings
[1:59:17] of the Earth have committed fornication
[1:59:18] with her and the merchants of the Earth
[1:59:20] are wax switched through the abundance
[1:59:21] of her Delicacies
[1:59:24] and I Heard a Voice so yeah sounded like
[1:59:29] a scriptural voice to me I heard another
[1:59:31] voice from him
[1:59:34] saying come
[1:59:36] here my people
[1:59:38] oh my
[1:59:40] God come on
[1:59:42] come on her y'all remember that
[1:59:45] he screwed
[1:59:49] and how many has come out
[1:59:51] aren't you glad you came out you heard
[1:59:54] that voice come out of her
[1:59:57] let me just stop there for a minute
[1:59:59] there was a minute there was a long time
[2:00:00] where Brother Band would say now you go
[2:00:02] find your good church we got a lot of
[2:00:03] good churches around
[2:00:05] many times all the time not until late
[2:00:07] 60s they made it towards the end of his
[2:00:09] days like 63 64 especially 64 and 65. I
[2:00:12] mean when he appreciates it talking
[2:00:14] about the invisible Union of Christ and
[2:00:15] abroad he says you know you can't belong
[2:00:17] to a man-made denomination and be the
[2:00:19] bride of Christ at the same time
[2:00:22] huh
[2:00:23] he said come out it's time to get out of
[2:00:25] there why because they rejected Christ
[2:00:27] after they rejected Christ there was no
[2:00:29] more time to put anybody into there he
[2:00:32] wouldn't the Holy Spirit wouldn't do
[2:00:33] that
[2:00:34] amen but he said come out of her my
[2:00:36] people
[2:00:37] so we heard that voice that you oh come
[2:00:40] out of her my people that you'd be not
[2:00:42] partakers of her sins and that you
[2:00:45] receive not her place
[2:00:48] praise be to God Amen aren't you glad
[2:00:51] for that
[2:00:52] Amen in closing there's another voice
[2:00:56] Amen in the future
[2:00:58] anytime now that we want to hear amen
[2:01:01] how is it the prophet of God says I may
[2:01:03] not have heard him say you know come
[2:01:05] unto me all you who were weary and heavy
[2:01:07] laden but I do want to hear him say Well
[2:01:09] done
[2:01:12] good servant coming in into the joys of
[2:01:15] the Lord
[2:01:16] amen
[2:01:18] he prays to God now notice over in
[2:01:20] Thessalonians the fourth chapter is a
[2:01:22] familiar scripture
[2:01:24] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[2:01:26] better concerning them with our sleep
[2:01:28] that ye saw or not even as others which
[2:01:29] have no hope
[2:01:31] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[2:01:33] rose again even to them also which sleep
[2:01:34] in Christ Jesus will God bring with him
[2:01:37] for this we say unto you by the word of
[2:01:39] the Lord that we which are alive and
[2:01:41] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[2:01:42] not prevent them which are asleep
[2:01:45] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:01:48] heaven with a shout
[2:01:51] amen
[2:01:53] now brother bear I'm kind of typed this
[2:01:54] with a shout being a message
[2:01:57] a shout amen come out here
[2:02:00] getting this ready amen
[2:02:02] with shout amen
[2:02:04] and with the voice of the archangel
[2:02:09] and the Trump of God and with the Trump
[2:02:12] of God and the dead of Christ shall rise
[2:02:15] first amen
[2:02:17] then we which are alive and remain and
[2:02:19] shall be caught up together
[2:02:21] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[2:02:24] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[2:02:27] the Lord
[2:02:29] Hallelujah the trumpets yourself how
[2:02:32] many knows when Jesus said Lazarus come
[2:02:35] forward oh God said if you just said
[2:02:37] come forth everybody to come forward
[2:02:41] one of these days the Trump of God to
[2:02:44] sound the Archangel that man there's
[2:02:45] going to be a trumpet sound
[2:02:47] we're gonna hear something come on up
[2:02:50] higher come on up it's time for the
[2:02:52] rapture
[2:02:55] Rapture time
[2:02:57] we which are alive and remain
[2:02:59] sound from Heaven is going to change our
[2:03:01] very bodies
[2:03:03] which aren't alive remains shall not
[2:03:06] prevent them which are asleep but it'll
[2:03:08] change our very bodies
[2:03:11] where do you think that Paul got that
[2:03:13] we're gonna
[2:03:15] go up in the clouds medium in the air
[2:03:17] in 1964 I forget now just which message
[2:03:20] it was but it was hard to enter the
[2:03:21] message of his life 1964. leather bam
[2:03:24] says like us I don't know what percent
[2:03:26] but a large percent of those who claim
[2:03:28] Christianity don't even believe in the
[2:03:31] literal second coming of the Lord
[2:03:35] he says my what hope do we have for our
[2:03:38] children if that's the case
[2:03:39] and it made me think of people around a
[2:03:41] message that don't look for the second
[2:03:43] literal coming of the Lord anymore
[2:03:46] what do you do with that quote he says
[2:03:47] with you know it's totally wrong
[2:03:50] if he don't come where are we going to
[2:03:51] leave he left right here sitting no it's
[2:03:54] he's going to come
[2:03:57] how many believes in a literal I believe
[2:03:59] in the spiritual coming of the Lord the
[2:04:00] Lord has come he's here
[2:04:03] I believe in God that he got he's here
[2:04:05] with us now absolutely but when he comes
[2:04:07] in his physical core performance Oliver
[2:04:09] with
[2:04:12] because in Acts 1 he says and when they
[2:04:14] had spoken to eat after he says unto the
[2:04:15] other most parts of theirs when he had
[2:04:17] spoken these things while they beheld he
[2:04:19] was taken up and the cloud received him
[2:04:21] out of their sight and while they looked
[2:04:24] steadfastly towards heaven where was
[2:04:27] this Cloud at
[2:04:30] without there towards heaven as he went
[2:04:33] up behold two men stood by them in white
[2:04:36] apparel which also said amen the Galilee
[2:04:38] why stand ye gazing up into heaven but
[2:04:42] he hadn't been telling me that for a
[2:04:43] long time how much why are you looking
[2:04:45] up I'm taking my eyes off of that until
[2:04:47] I can't see it no more
[2:04:49] when you have been gazing we'd have been
[2:04:52] gazing we'd all been gay
[2:04:54] but I think he was making a point
[2:04:56] why are you standing and gazing up he
[2:04:58] said this same Jesus which is taken up
[2:05:00] from you into heaven shall so come
[2:05:04] in like manner
[2:05:06] as you have seen him go
[2:05:08] into heaven
[2:05:10] praise be to God you love him this
[2:05:12] morning stand with
[2:05:14] gosh
[2:05:24] musicians if you want to come
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:36] oh I've been listening for a different
[2:05:40] sound
[2:05:42] of the Bride being united with the lamb
[2:05:46] y'all remember that song
[2:05:48] why keep listening I keep listening
