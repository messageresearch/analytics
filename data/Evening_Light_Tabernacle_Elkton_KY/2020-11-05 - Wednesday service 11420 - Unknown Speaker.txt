i could just stand back here and listen to them play and uh i'm a big admirer of this young man because that was my desire to always play a guitar and i never could i just sent back there to listen to him play that and i thought maybe we just do that tonight let them play the songs and i can just sit back there and rest tonight let's stand the night and sing that well let us have a little talk with jesus let us tell him all about he will hear our faintest strike and heal and survive now when you [Music] i like this last verse well i may have doubts and fears and my eyes be filled with tears for

[Music] [Music] you will find a little talk with jesus you believe that with all of your heart tonight amen god bless you it's good to see each and everyone out tonight and we have some prayer requests we want to take the lord in prayer tonight and before we do i was called a friend of mine he lives down by jeffersonville brother truman jackson and we had prayer for sister carol his wife and she's had cancer and i just every once while i call him just to see how they're doing and i called him uh i guess it was last night my days they kind of get away from me but i asked him how everything was going and he said sister carol was doing really good and they thanking god for the cancer being gone and and so he goes to brother nathan bryant's church and brother nathan's mother had cancer also and i said well how's brother nathan's mom doing he said she's doing fine so the lords healed her of cancer and and i said well and there was four in their church that had cancer there was three sisters and a brother and i said well how and i'm ashamed of myself because i wrote the other sister's name down and i wrote it so bad i couldn't even read it myself and he said he said she's doing fine but he said she was on dialysis before she got the cancer and he said she needs a touch from the lord for that and i said well we'll remember her in prayer and of course i messed her name up and asked him about the brother and he said he's doing fine he's cancer-free and i just began to i said god you're an awesome god and i told jan you know i said you know we get we get sick every once in a while but people that go through a disease like cancer and i watched it with my mother and i said you know we don't know what it is if you haven't had something like that to know what it is to get up and be sick and all day long you're sick until god moves in such a way that it's gone and and then i begin to think of what brother thomas preached on sunday god's miracles and my heart just

lord help us father that we might let the word come down into our hearts and in our soul and lord have it let it not come back to your void father but that it would accomplish lord what it was intended for we love you and we just ask god for your divine guidance now in jesus name amen and amen open your bibles if you will the second corinthians speak on a very familiar subject for us amen and it was something that brother branham spoke on amen and i just want to see what the lord will have for us amen to come and to see what he'll pull from it and i'm going to a different scripture than what he used let's say let's go to ii corinthians sixth chapter second corinthians six and we'll begin with verse 14 through verse 17 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what accord concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement at the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and i will walk in them i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you let's go to first corinthians first corinthians first chapter verse 18 and then we'll jump down to verse 22. verse 18 says for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god verse 22 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified and to the jews the stumbling block and unto the greeks foolishness but unto them that are called both to the jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen the a and things which are not to bring to not things that are amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word amen you can be seated i want to take my message and i'm going to call it just what brother branham called it i want to talk about oddballs oddballs amen amen i think every one of us is familiar with that uh tape and that message that brother brandon preached on oddballs amen and i got to thinking about that and uh uh one place brother bam said you know the farmer is a oddball to the business man and and he just went on a couple different things and how that uh he got to speaking of diversity amen of the many different diversities that we have in the world we're certainly living in a world of diversity and it seems to be that the world amen is trying to make everybody one everybody the same amen and we're living in that kind of a world but you know the truth of the matter is is that we're living in a world that has a lot of diverse kind of people now right and we know brother branham taught many places and he said different things about how that god wants separators he says the world wants mixers they want to mix it all together you know i'd mix it all together but god wants separators people that you know realize that you are different amen and there's so many different different things in different clans uh i believe it was somewhere in revelations it talks about in the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of him amen so even the bible talks about how that there's a lot of different tribes right and so we know back in the indian times there was a lot of different a lot of different tribes even though they were all indian there was all still a lot of tribes a lot of different tribes and they would have contention with those tribes and because of that diversity that there is in the world and the differences that there is in the world there is always bound to be stress there is always bound to be friction amen and we all know that it doesn't take a whole lot to have friction or to have differences and to bring division in that right to bring division amongst people because really uh you know even two people can't walk together unless they be agreed right and so uh even people having different one of the major things that causes divisiveness and brings divisiveness is even as much as somebody having a different opinion either idea a different idea or a different goal will cause people to have be divisive amen and it kind of separates people it you know if you don't have the same goal as somebody else if you don't think the same as somebody else it has a tendency to separate you amen and we know that even though all the indians here in america when they were here they were all different tribes and so forth you know it was because of the fact that they couldn't come together amen amen and and really clan together is why they lost the war and so forth but they were all indians they shouldn't you would think that they would all get together but they all have their little differences in that right amen and they were odd to each other our our our differences become odd to each other amen and if you have a certain idea and i think we could take our democrats and our republicans and you know they have different goals they have different ambitions you know and so it divides them you know you know if you don't have the same goal you're not on the same path i mean it brings division and so forth amen and so we look at this and i will begin to think about how that brother branham even would talk about even the farmer and some something as simple as the farmer and the businessman and and because they have different ideas they have different desires perhaps different goals and you know uh you know and so it causes them to be an oddball he says it makes them odd to each other amen it makes them odd amen so let me just start and i want to i want to you know i want to say this perhaps while i have to have it in my mind because a lot of times i don't don't think about it later on but we realized that brother branham talked about the churches the pentecostals the oneness the tunis the threeness you know there was a lot of different churches they had a lot of a lot of different ideas and different a different way they saw the scripture and it would cause that caused them to be divided you know right but he said many times he talked about you know when you're really filled with the holy ghost amen it you don't dwell on those differences is that right amen if you dwell on those differences and those differences causes you to be divided then you really don't have the spirit of god amen and so when it comes to the church of god we want to get to this a little bit later perhaps when it comes to the body of christ amen we don't have divisions we don't we aren't oddballs to each other because we have the same goal we have the same thought we have the same ideas how many believes that and i'll perhaps take to take it to scripture after a while let me just start tonight by reading a story that i really like amen and the first one if you don't mind i'm just gonna um i'm just going to mention it because no actually right here it is i mean i did print it out i didn't think i printed it out but i'm going to go ahead and read it now notice he says now this is really not any place for jokes and so forth but there was a little german out german man out west on the west coast where we was at and he received the holy ghost and he went down the street and he just began to walk a little beast and he'd raise up his hands and he'd speak in tongues he'd run he'd jump he'd shout and he was at work carrying on like that and his balls came to him said you know where have you been amen he says well you must have been there with amongst that bunch of nuts amen and he says then you think they are nuts he said sure they are amen so how many knows that we could go on this morning this evening and knowing realizing that and we as christians were called fanatics we're called uh holy rollers we're called nuts we're called crazy we're called all kinds of names that we get called why because we're an oddball to somebody that's not a christian and part of the reason that i mentioned that and read that in first corinthians was because and paul even was saying here that you know uh that with the greeks and with the jews not not the with the greeks and who was it the greeks and the jews that was the jews the jews require a sign to greet seek after wisdom and even even say bringing the distinction between them talking about how that they even think that you know one of them requires this they look for this they look for that you know and they call the preaching of the gospel foolishness amen they call it foolishness but we realize that amen to us it's the last thing but foolish amen it's the power of god preaching it it's salvation to us but they think it's foolishness the very thing that can save you so they think it's foolish amen and when uh and now and if you'll notice let me finish the story but now notice so here he says the boss called him call said that they're a bunch of nuts and he said well praise the lord for the nuts he says do you know what he says the nuts play a big part amen he says for instance in the automobile you take all the nuts out of it and you ain't got nothing but a bunch of young or junk isn't that right a bunch of young and so that's just about right amen how many knows that's pretty much you can apply that to the whole world amen you take the people of god that are considered to be nuts you take them out and you really got nothing but sodom and gomorrah you got nothing but a bunch of junk amen because these nuts is really what hold things together amen and we can go all the way down through time but abandon did he talk about noah's day how did he was a nut he was considered a fanatic he was considered a nut to think that it was going to rain amen and let me just say first of all you know because of the diversity that we have there's definite major diverse things in the bible amen there's not all people are the same all right because uh you know even paul talked about here he talks about what fellowship does light have with darkness jesus said you know i send you out into this world like sheep amongst wolves hello there's a big difference there and so there's wolves in this world there's a sheep in the world we realize there's canes in the world the lineage of cain which are murderers and everything else amen there's the children of darkness isn't that right and the children of light there's a big difference there amen it's a huge difference amen it divides us it makes us amen different we don't have the same goal we don't have the same ambitions amen one is of darkness one is of light there is amen major differences in the world amen and so you know just taking this so he says listen he says and when you so when you you are so different amen when you get the holy ghost when the holy ghost comes on to you on you until you mind until the mind of this world don't like you he says they're against you they want nothing to do with you after all you're born of another world and you become an alien to this world now there's another whole thought in itself that when you become born again you put yourself in a special class of people how many knows that amen when you're born of the holy ghost you become a part of the body of christ amen now the body of christ amen it may have diversity of gifts and diverse kind of people and so forth but even though we have all of this diversity the one thing that we have in common and the one thing that welds all our diversity together and it glues it together is the love of god how many believes that when you have the love of god even though we're different we think different we have different traits you know perhaps naturally speaking in our nature and some of our characteristics are very different when it comes to holy ghost amen those differences get away from you like the prophet of god said amen you don't see those differences you don't recognize those difference because truly you end up having the one one mind you have the same goal once you're dropped in the body of christ through the new birth in other words you are not an oddball to each other amen because you know you can't have the same people thinking the same way having the same goal you're not odd to each other why because you're one body amen praise the lord so it makes you different he's asking me the world especially they don't want nothing to do you amen they don't have no fellowship with you amen praise the lord the second one i want to bring in is a very well known story amen how that brother bam tells the story here he says and now i was going down the street one time in los angeles california i seen a very odd person amen acting ah how many knows a real christian is a odd person to the world peculiar people hey that different people this person was an odd person going down there and he was walking down the street not picketing but just merely taking an afternoon stroke and i went to the other side of the street to see what he was doing everybody was turning around laughing at him because of his peculiarity i noticed he had a sign hanging on the front of him and i thought that i'd see what everybody was laughing about this odd peculiar man and so i noticed him and as the people looked at him they laughed at him and he seemed to have a different kind of a smile a smile of contentment amen how many believes that's the way to the christian dead amen now i see none of y'all going down through elkton with this sign on your back yet huh we'll be kind of different wouldn't it and listen smile of contentment and other smiles that people were giving him was kind more of a ridiculing him but he seemed satisfied in what he was doing amen now me knows as we go through this life as young people grow up there's a you have to decide which oddball you're going to be with what crowd you're going to hang with because i mean there's a lot of different crowds out there there's a whole lot of different churches there's all kinds of different people oh my you know i mean you look at what are the motorcycle rallies that happen different places you know on the oh my i mean you could be a part of that you look about oh man there's just so many different ones huh but i don't know about you but for me you have to make a chance you have to make a choice to where you gonna be what you gonna do i like that song i mean that number i'm in that number amen that blood washed number robed in white amen i want to be in that number you have to decide what what crowd you're gonna be with i don't know about you but for for me being a christian i want to be in that crowd amen that's washed in the blood of jesus christ that stands amen on the other side in eternity with eternal life i want to be one of them how many wants to be one of them that's what i want to be i want to be one of those ones that live through all of eternity amen and i don't mind being a fool or whatever it takes an oddball or a nut whatever people want to think of me it doesn't matter to me as long as i'm a part of that number out of all the other numbers of all the different crowds that's the crowd i want to belong into the one that's going to leave this world one of these days amen but this man here he was happy with what he was doing that's what a whole lot what i think about when a man satisfied in what he's doing is right though he be an oddball to somebody else if he's satisfied that what he's doing is right then let him stay that way stay with it this man was so satisfied with who he was so satisfied with being in the crowd of oddball he didn't mind putting a sign on his front and putting a sign on his back and on the front front he says you might call this foolish i may be a fool i don't mind being a fool for christ he says i am a fool for christ praise the lord amen and as he went by brother brown says listen this and as i come close to the little man notice across his chest here was a black board was wrote i am a fool and at the bottom head for christ amen i'm a fool in great letters and down at the bottom said for christ and everybody was laughing at this oh my who you reckon is going to have the last lap pete when he gets over the other side now people on the other side they're going to say there's that guy that walked down the street had that he said boy i didn't mind being a fool for christ because i know where i was going y'all and that right that's right so they might have laughed at him but he'll have the last laugh i'm a fool for christ everybody laughing listen laughing and as the little man pressed on down through the crowd of cheers and carrying on i looked to turn to look what was on his back and there was a great big question mark on this back said down at the bottom said now whose fool are you whose nut are you amen everybody's nut but says everybody's a nut amen you might i might be you're not not to you but you're not to me all right and i've of course listen let me finish this here so he says and then thinking of this group all right paul had said i have become a fool in glory and so forth then thinking of this group no doubt that in the eyes of people on the other side you've become a fool you have become what they would call today the oddball huh boy isn't he a oddball isn't she an oddball nut fool whatever you want to call him the oddballs listen and remember no doubt but what people think that of you but and remember that on the other side there are eyeballs too amen didn't paul say no man lives to himself and no man dies to himself you gotta serve somebody amen people don't like that i don't serve nobody yes you do you serve somebody and i hate to tell you this but it's either god or it's the devil if it ain't god guess who it is the devil amen most likely i dare say that if they say i ain't serving nobody i could dare say you know you're serving the devil if you're not serving nobody because you're serving yourself thereby serving the devil huh you got to serve somebody praise the lord got to be somebody's full i mean people don't mind being the devil's fool people are not huh didn't brother brown say that uh i believe i've got a couple places where it talks about the bible saw somebody mad it means they're crazy crazy is nuts all right well another words for crazy said a bunch of that didn't matter the whole world would go leaves their mind big dog go nuts the world's gone nuts amen praise the lord except for the real believer they might call you nuts they might call you crazy and truly brother john we have lost our mind and blood said yeah i lost mine a long time ago i gave up my mind for the mind of christ yeah that's right amen you got to give up your mind so that you can have the mind of christ praise the lord so how many of you got to be different they're to be different the song says they are to be different well they dare to be different we just don't there to be different huh but listen so you think about the world think about how they paint themselves up what they do and how nuts they act people go to the ball game and they all like nuts oh boy but didn't brother bam talk about he says he is somewhere i don't know if he's seen it or what but that'll be a ball game you know they get so so hyped up that they take this big old straw hat when somebody got a home run he said they grabbed that saw and go and jerk it down over their head and give himself some ring just with that ring of that straw hat finally looking pope pied up there and ring around his collar you know they say they don't care how they're acting around here they're excited they completely act a fool they don't mind acting fool for this side or the other but come to church bam says and oh brother venom i couldn't preach man if that woman like that screams and stuff it sends chills up my back you know he said you'd freeze the debts if you got to heaven there's going to be a bunch of big bunch of screaming you ever heard but you don't mind going out there screaming but uh come on folks better be yeah come on think about it you know look at david how many knows david was the nut he went a little crazy lower when you think about how good god is and how great god is and how wonderful god is amen how many knows david had been delivered out of the hands of his enemies and out of the jaws of death a million times when the ark when god was coming into the camp he didn't mind going and dancing and shouting and screaming and hollering so much until his wife thought david you are nuts michelle or michelle i guess somehow it's pronounced like that and you know she thought he was nuts people might have thought he was nuts but he didn't mind being up for christ we need more nuts we need people that are a little bit more fanatical about god why because he's worth it he's our everything he's all he's our breath he's our sunshine he's our all in all amen that's right so he says the other side is two they're all oddballs amen so you have to be somebody's fool not rather be a fool for christ see god said that his people would be a peculiar people ah chosen elected royal priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices unto god hey folks when they have those rock and roll bands and those uh concerts that they're worshiping the devil they're worshiping they're bringing up sacrifices to the devil when we come to church we sing amazing grace how sweet this out that saved a wretch like me we're offering up spiritual sacrifices to our god glory praise the lord offering up spiritual sacrifice says worshiping our god so if we get the acting a little stupid to people or like or not that's just fine with me huh he's worth it he never corrected him he said no david you got a little wildfire there make sure you leave your shirt on tomorrow huh no he never corrected him he would if he would have got out of line he says that's the way i like to be worshipped somebody really loves the lord amen now don't get me wrong we don't strip our shirt off today right but people can take things out of context can't they that's where brother bam says why i am so misunderstood he would say stuff and people would say hey it's all right rip your shirt off you heard him up there uh amen you love the lord okay so that's right oddballs they are oh my when you think about it oddballs or a nut and this guy here henry amen he says you know if it wasn't for the nuts everything would fall apart amen i may know that if it wouldn't have been for the days of noah if it wouldn't have been for the nut no flesh would have been saved now butterbank says that you know if if you have a nut there has to be a bolt to fit that nut and it's got to be threaded to that bolt i wanted to bring a bolt and i didn't i forgot to do it big old bolt in a nut you know because when you've got that nut all by itself well it's just a nut right but if that nut is threaded to something it serves a purpose amen and i'll tell you what david he was threaded to something that served a purpose noah was threaded to almighty god and it pulled everybody that listened to that nut everybody that was connected to that nut it pulled them amen and it saved them from the flood amen if it wouldn't have been for that it all been lost amen most how many knows moses was considered a nut i also called some of these people that people call nuts crazy mad pioneers noah was a pioneer he was going into territory in the place where they had never went before there was never no rain before but yet he said there's going to be because god said there is moses when he came down into pharaoh's presence he said let my people go god said it amen and pharaoh amen listen noah i mean moses was a nut to pharaoh what is this not doing in my audience here amy telling me he come in here telling me that i gotta let all my people go but yet on the opposite side brother ben says student pharaoh was also nut he's crazy not listen to moses he's crazy how could you hear that god said do it and then not do it knowing the history of the israelites and that god was with him kind of like you and me today right i mean we talk about amen we talk about god and people think we're nuts and we think they're nuts because listen with the identification with what god has come and proved himself alive and look at the miracle of everything and then you still can't see god you still don't believe god even though you're walking on the miracle every day of your life you're walking on the miracle of god and you never see it never recognize it you fail to acknowledge there's a god even the universe couldn't be this way without the heaven to be a god you've got to be crazy well i think the way i think it see it you have got to be a nut you've got to be completely crazy to walk on a miracle to know that this thing can't just be by chance the stars and galaxies amen the very earth that you were creating was created by the word of god it's created by this bible right here how many believes that this is what created the heavens and the earth most important book brother mom says you know there was a certain man that wrote the book nadal said that that was the most most important book it was the book of the year brother brown says i beg to differ with you every year the book of the year is this book right here amen aren't you glad to have a prophet like what we did how many knows he was a nut to the world too the man says it's about time for another nut he's at the pentecostal we're nuts for a while they were considered nuts they were considered crazy why they'd speak in tongues shout and mind run the aisles and do all kinds of things man they were all considered great they were nuts for a while but what is it it's the thing that held it together and they said now they went right back into the same slot that they came out of amendment it's about time for another nut to come on the scene we did get another nut to come on the scene i'm glad to be associated with that nut that's right because guess what it's not it is connected to a boat called christ and it's going to thread us right into the skies one of these days amen and then they can have this world amen we'll be back when it's cleaned off amen praise the lord that's right look at that just the different ones moses considered a nut considered crazy john the baptist to the pharisees they didn't even realize he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the lord he was threatening everybody to christ and they're right telling them christ's coming trying to thread him to death you know and everybody listen to them got baptized amen and then jesus come along and was he called crazy was he a nut turn with me if you will let's go see saint john 10. how many knows man mad means crazy crazy's a nut what we would call today the crazy house loony bin amen well we would call people nuts they're nuts out of their mind crazy when jesus went to preaching chapter 10 of saint john verse 18 no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this come this commandment have i received it by my father and there was a division therefore among the jews for the for these saints how many knows that whenever paul preached he'd always be a division jesus preached there's always a division light separating from darkness those who believe and those who believe not amen and many of them said he hath the devil and is mad huh called him crazy called him a nut right why hear ye him other said these are not the words of him that have the devil can the devil open eye the eyes of the blind jesus comes along and he preaches amen even talking about unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood and everything else and they thought he was crazy why because he was just a humble carpenter son mary and joseph amen he was born in such a humble way come in such a humble way until they could not recognize it but i mean knows that he was rejected most of the time their nuts are rejected they don't accept them just like they didn't today let me tell you something it's going to be quite the judgment is going to be quite something isn't it for this generation of people who were in the prophet of god's meetings and saw the messiah come down jesus come down in the holy ghost form and discern the thoughts and tense of the heart time and time and time again and then to put him out it's going to be a day of reckoning amen so even jesus was called mad along comes paul how many knows that paul also was called crazy he also was called a nut or in acts 26 acts 26 we'll begin with verse 19. it says whereupon king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but showed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me having therefore obtained help of god i continued unto this day witnessing both to the small and to the great saying none other things then those which the prophets and moses did say should come that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the gentiles and as he does speak for himself festus said with the loud lights paul died beside thyself much learning has made me mad huh you're mad paul you're not but what was it this nut here brought the message in the gospel from the jews to us gentiles and that right pull us right into the presence of god amen what people call foolish and fools nuts and crazy god calls grace amen praise the lord let me just say this in closing let's read over and as i was saying there's two factions there's now we know that even we as people we as human beings all of us we we have a lot of diversity a lot of differences a lot of different ways perhaps that we do things families can be different families do difference we're taught different by our parents a lot of times and because of that sometimes it causes friction sometimes we'll think them people are odd you know oh my we each and every one of us are like man if it isn't done the way i think it ought to be done it ain't done right you know and that's where we let go you know it's just you know it doesn't work too good but when you come into the body of christ let's let's see what paul said because i don't believe that in the body of christ we're not a bunch of crazy people to each other we're not a bunch of nuts to each other and then when you say like i believe that acts 2 38 it's the way to come to christ we can't say amen to that brother there's one lord one faith one baptism amen but there's one body one church and it's not because you amen shook my hand or joined evening like tabernacle but there's only one body and you have to be baptized into that body by the holy ghost it makes us one amen it brings us together when we get the holy ghost how many knows there's one thing that like i said earlier amen that actually wells and absolutely glues us together and i want to tell you right now that's what keeps a family together it's what keeps a church together it's what keeps friends together is the love of the lord jesus christ now how many knows that god tried to glue the whole world together amen by saint john's saint john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave his only god son and whosoever should believe him should not perish but every blessing he tried to reach out and this generation and the signs and the wonders that he did world over he tried to get the pentecostals and the baptists and the methodists and all of them we all know that in the in around 1960 1962 1963 you know right in that timeframe he would try to get them all together and cause them all to be glued together by the love of god because that's the only thing that will overrule your differences and your oddness to each other it's the holy spirit in your heart it's the only thing that'll do it nothing else will do it if it isn't there you're not going to be glued together amen there's one quote that i thought of back there that i want to just mention here brother bam says when you separate from divine love then you can't overlook your brother's mistakes or his faults or his differences in that right can't overlook him anymore you gotta bawl him out for it that's right you can't overlook your sister's mistakes no more because you've gotten away from the divine part that love part but if you really love the lord jesus if your sister or brother does something to you that's all right they didn't mean to do it i mean those love covers a multitude of sins now how many knows that the opposite of love is what hate right hate will cause you to magnify each other's differences and and really it tears nations apart in it's tearing our nation apart right now but we know that they refused love they refused god now god gives them hate and as a result of hate amen you have people that absolutely hate each other amen and it's a sad sad thing amen because it tears it rips apart it's like taking a piece of cloth and just shredding it i mean if you lose the holy ghost it's so easy to have a falling out with your brother or your sister they did they did this they did that you know you know there you go but the love of god goes way beyond that realizing hey you know i'm not perfect either what if god wrote you off every time you made a mistake or you did something wrong so i don't know about you but i didn't believe that what the church of god what we all need more is the love of god in our heart it wells us together and it causes us to do like paul did here in closing he says in first corinthians he says you know now i beseech you brethren by the name of the lord jesus that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you amen the world sure there's a separation there's a division between a believer and unbeliever there's a division between a make-believer and a believer and certainly like paul said earlier don't be unequally equally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship has light with darkness and so forth but you when you're in the whole same holy spirit he says there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it has been declared upon you my brother by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you amen why because they were still nitpicking about their little difference one is a paul one is of this one all the little differences that the love of god's supposed to take care of and the division and all the things that makes people seem odd to each other it all goes by the wayside i mean he believes there's none of that in the body of christ god bless you tonight stand with me musicians if you'll come i mean loves the lord i mean loves each other [Applause] how many
