[0:02] fritz
[0:03] fritz al fritz that's right
[0:08] amen says he used to have a dog named
[0:10] fritz
[0:11] and he would cut coons he would catch
[0:13] possibly he would catch anything that he
[0:14] wanted to
[0:15] but i'll tell you what when he came to
[0:16] an old possum he had a hold back
[0:20] dude i don't know what he did
[0:23] he wouldn't attack that possum but
[0:26] brother brandon being his master
[0:28] said look them said french get him that
[0:31] was it
[0:32] folks i have had to wash dogs with all
[0:34] kinds of stuff where they got my dog got
[0:36] into skunk i don't want him to get in
[0:38] the skunk
[0:39] but he didn't care what he smelled like
[0:40] he was going to get that scum he got
[0:42] that skunk
[0:43] he says that's the way it is when a
[0:45] congregation does a man but you know
[0:47] what i also thought of
[0:49] of my own thought my own thought is that
[0:51] when somebody says amen
[0:53] it's like having a little fire and
[0:55] taking a whole cup of what gas
[0:56] and just stuff it on on there poof
[1:00] that's what it does
[1:03] now let me ask you them if the amen will
[1:05] do that to the holy ghost
[1:08] what will quiet shh
[1:13] no amens huh
[1:17] what if this morning nobody amen no
[1:20] response
[1:21] i would already be struggling for my
[1:23] next scripture here
[1:25] well what am i going to say next you
[1:28] know
[1:29] that's right but you ignite the fire how
[1:32] many knows when you come to the church
[1:34] can i ask you another question this is
[1:36] another one of my questions
[1:39] i'm getting them both mixed up now
[1:42] if you got anything out of church what
[1:45] did you have to bring
[1:47] to get it what did you have to have
[1:51] when you came to church and what did you
[1:54] have to do
[1:54] when you came to church if you're going
[1:55] to get anything
[1:58] any rants go ahead
[2:04] that's it brother joshua
[2:07] expect a prophet's title he said you get
[2:11] what you expect you had to come with
[2:14] expectation
[2:17] that's a problem sometimes we go to
[2:19] church we just think well we're going to
[2:20] have another church there he's going to
[2:22] be enough
[2:22] to all mine and he said if you come if
[2:26] you want to come and you want to find
[2:28] fault
[2:29] yeah are you going to find any yes
[2:32] [Applause]
[2:34] i'm sure before steve got done you had
[2:37] something
[2:37] that you could find thought with what
[2:39] brother steve said
[2:42] and expressed even maybe coming up and
[2:44] reading the script maybe you fought for
[2:46] that
[2:47] if you come to find fault and sure
[2:49] plenty of
[2:50] it
[2:53] amen but i thank god we don't have fault
[2:56] finders here this morning
[2:58] because you certainly go out those doors
[3:00] worse than what you came
[3:01] in how many wants to go out the door is
[3:04] different than what you came in amen and
[3:07] if you don't have the kind of life that
[3:08] you want to have
[3:09] amen don't go out those dogs this
[3:11] morning until you're 100
[3:12] for sure that the holy spirit has spoken
[3:15] to your heart
[3:16] and says look if you're not living the
[3:17] way you're supposed to
[3:19] then you better change the way that
[3:21] you're living every day
[3:22] because you can't do the same thing
[3:24] every time and come to church and expect
[3:26] the church to be different
[3:30] no sir it's insanity
[3:34] you're blinded if you think that's going
[3:37] to happen
[3:38] the only way that you're kind of closer
[3:40] up with god and the man when he was
[3:41] talking about an over 80 old young man
[3:43] old woman
[3:44] he says you know if i asked him what
[3:46] would be your heart's desire he says and
[3:48] they would say
[3:49] that it is a closer walk with god that's
[3:52] what i don't care how old we get we
[3:54] wanna close to walk with god
[3:58] that's what we come for a closer look
[4:01] with god
[4:05] that's what enoch had he had a close
[4:07] walk with god
[4:11] if we're gonna have a body change you're
[4:14] going to be translated
[4:17] you're going to be walking with god
[4:20] you're going to be walking close to god
[4:24] or you're going to be left behind thus
[4:28] saith the lord
[4:30] hallelujah you'll be left behind
[4:34] if you do not have a close walk with god
[4:41] all these little things got to go by the
[4:43] wayside amen or are we
[4:45] in those courts that brother ben talked
[4:47] about there's the outer court there's
[4:48] the inner court
[4:49] and then there's the holies of holies
[4:52] amen some people are get justified they
[4:54] get picked up they come to church but
[4:56] every time they man the first time they
[4:57] come up to a red sea
[4:59] and they begin to complain and murmur
[5:01] because they aren't patient
[5:03] they don't wait on god be still and know
[5:06] that i am god
[5:08] they have a problem comes along the
[5:09] first time david complained
[5:12] remember that what israel did
[5:17] oh my god they were justified god called
[5:19] him out of egypt
[5:21] and then let him come up to that red sea
[5:23] the trouble strike
[5:25] this ain't right moses what kind of a
[5:27] leader are you
[5:30] take us into a dead end like this huh
[5:34] even moses didn't know what to do and he
[5:35] had to crowd god
[5:37] isn't that right
[5:42] oh my where are you
[5:45] huh who are you now right where are you
[5:50] with god first of all you gotta know who
[5:53] you
[5:53] are that you're a son and daughter of
[5:56] god
[5:57] now something's happened down in your
[5:59] heart that has changed you from you what
[6:01] you used to be
[6:06] all right i'm not the man i used to be
[6:10] you're not the woman that you used to be
[6:13] praise be to god

[6:16] this is like let me tell you about the
[6:18] walk
[6:19] that we're to have with almighty god
[6:22] it's like this
[6:24] a young man and a young girl
[6:27] meet each other and they talk to each
[6:28] other they get to know each other
[6:30] they fall in love with each other amen

[7:06] sunday till i can see you
[7:08] hey man you begin to oh my i want to be
[7:10] closer to her
[7:11] amen just a bit of romance here
[7:16] i used to drive a motorcycle around a
[7:18] big old black
[7:19] overcoat on and knowing a biler i ran
[7:23] out of gas
[7:24] it was about church time and i was just
[7:26] about a half a mile down the road maybe
[7:27] not even that
[7:28] and i was walking came into church
[7:32] and i guess i've thumbed i guess
[7:36] and they were coming to church they saw
[7:38] me
[7:40] and donna should tell the story she said
[7:41] sonic she says mom can i stop and pick
[7:43] him up
[7:44] she said yeah you can
[7:48] stop and pick me up i was in the back
[7:50] seat there and you know
[7:52] i was looking at the mirror and she
[7:54] looked in the mirror she said all that
[7:56] he caught be looking
[8:01] oh my but that's how we started out
[8:05] it's like that it's that you know and
[8:07] you're like man i can't wait till the
[8:09] next time i can see her
[8:11] you get engaged and you can't wait to
[8:13] get married
[8:14] why because you want to be together and
[8:17] you go and you see each other
[8:19] i mean in that right you fly here you
[8:21] fly there you go wherever you want
[8:23] whoever just to get to know each other
[8:25] just to be with each other
[8:26] because that's your desire you can't
[8:28] wait for the day to where you live
[8:30] together
[8:31] same house same place have fellowship
[8:33] and be together and that's the way it is
[8:35] with god
[8:35] and with you he wants us to get closer
[8:38] and closer and one of these aids we're
[8:40] going to be with him
[8:42] it's a love relationship lord talk to me
[8:46] some more lord communicate with me
[8:48] let me hear that still small voice
[8:51] [Applause]
[8:53] because we're in the process of getting
[8:54] closer to each other
[8:56] and one of these days we'll be together
[9:00] forever amen
[9:03] praise the lord oh my
[9:07] you love him this morning praise be to
[9:10] god so we come to church we come
[9:12] under expectation because we know that
[9:15] everything has been provided for us
[9:19] every blessing of god every word of god
[9:22] as long as jesus sitting on that meteor
[9:26] mediator seat there is
[9:29] there's an ability to receive the
[9:32] blessings of god no matter what it is
[9:34] no matter whether it's baptism whether
[9:37] it's baptism of the holy ghost whether
[9:39] it's salvation
[9:40] whether it's healing whether it's joy
[9:42] whether it's a closer walk with god
[9:44] oh my it's there for us
[9:47] if you desire it amen
[9:51] but we have to be careful
[9:54] a tree is known by its fruit can i get a
[9:57] little sticky here now
[10:04] a christian according to paul said that
[10:07] we look to things that are not seen
[10:10] not to the things that are seen how many
[10:13] believes the holy ghost looks further
[10:15] than the things of the world in
[10:18] first john
[10:21] 3 and verse 15 this is kind of to test
[10:25] us to see where we're at
[10:27] and to see what kind of fruit we have in
[10:30] our life
[10:31] amen here it says love not the world
[10:37] neither the things that are in
[10:41] the world what does that cover
[10:47] everything it didn't say just certain
[10:50] things
[10:51] neither the things that are in the world
[10:55] if any man love the world the love of
[10:58] the father is not in him
[11:02] can we say it this way if you love the
[11:04] things that you have to have
[11:06] to live every day if you love those
[11:08] things more than you love god
[11:10] the love of god is not even in you
[11:13] if it takes precedence over the love of
[11:16] almighty god then the love of god
[11:18] isn't in you because if the love of god
[11:20] is in you
[11:21] then you love and you look to the things
[11:24] that are not seen
[11:26] because the holy spirit is a long-range
[11:29] vision
[11:30] amen how many believes we've got to keep
[11:33] our balance in things
[11:35] for all that is in the world the lust of
[11:37] the flesh the lust of the eye
[11:39] and the pride of life is not of the
[11:41] father but is of the world
[11:43] the world passes away and the lust
[11:45] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[11:47] god
[11:47] abideth forever
[11:51] hey amen i'll tell you right now it's so
[11:55] easy
[11:56] to get our to not be balanced in
[11:59] our daily life with the things that are
[12:03] spiritual and the things that are
[12:05] natural
[12:07] amen just this week
[12:11] with the water and everything spent like
[12:14] three days and i was
[12:16] very concerned about the water and
[12:17] digging it and so forth and that by
[12:19] saturday needing to go back do one more
[12:20] thing and so forth
[12:22] and then by saturday night i said you
[12:23] know i really don't like it
[12:26] i don't like that i got so busy now to
[12:29] preach to y'all
[12:30] about being so busy that you don't have
[12:32] time for god
[12:34] and then by the time i got to really
[12:36] study and i began to look at the clock
[12:38] and say you know look
[12:39] look what you've done for everything
[12:41] else now here towards the end of the day
[12:43] you want to give god the last of the day
[12:50] huh i'm like lord
[12:54] well i would like to have a good service
[12:55] tomorrow
[12:58] i want the people to enjoy the service i
[12:59] want the holy spirit there
[13:01] amen god can still do it no i wasn't all
[13:05] that busy y'all would have probably
[13:06] better brother you'd apologize brother
[13:08] you were slow you didn't get nothing
[13:09] done today
[13:10] because i know what it's like to be
[13:12] young hey man you can get a trillion
[13:13] things done when you're young
[13:15] when you get my age guess what it's only
[13:17] half a trillion
[13:23] but yet you know i ask myself you have
[13:26] to ask yourself how much time
[13:28] did you spend when you get up in the
[13:29] morning what is your daily routine
[13:34] what is your daily rotation
[13:38] amen you get up do you forget to pray
[13:40] how much time do you spend in prayer
[13:43] and how many believe that it shouldn't
[13:44] be five or ten minutes and that's all
[13:47] you ever do
[13:48] all your life know it you get to be more
[13:51] and more and more i'll tell you what in
[13:54] my heart's desire
[13:56] if i can't i i buy these little speakers
[14:04] and you can carry your phone right here
[14:05] and if you want to you can hook it on
[14:06] your belt over here it might be a little
[14:08] dangly
[14:09] but you can have the bible playing all
[14:12] the time you can have the message
[14:13] playing all the time
[14:14] now i don't know i know people got jobs
[14:16] you can't do all of that but
[14:17] for you you're your own boss
[14:20] huh you can do that you can listen to a
[14:23] lot more
[14:24] than what you might even think and
[14:25] that's i like to hear it right but the
[14:27] bible talks doesn't the bible tell us
[14:28] amen bind it upon your bed tell us when
[14:30] they'll get
[14:31] this done think about it during the day
[14:35] think about it that night think about it
[14:36] we'd be different people if we'd be more
[14:38] like that
[14:41] amen i tell you why we need to lean to
[14:43] the left side of the road a little bit
[14:44] more when it comes to
[14:46] more of the spiritual and less of the
[14:48] natural
[14:50] i think we can agree i bet you can agree
[14:52] this morning that your natural part
[14:54] is a whole lot more than the spiritual
[14:56] part it's not balanced like it should be
[14:59] and then you wonder
[15:00] why your prayers go unanswered why it
[15:02] seems like god don't answer your prayer
[15:04] hey man you come to church you're all
[15:05] sad
[15:07] why we wear a frown and why we don't
[15:09] have joy amen why we
[15:11] can't shake each other's hand after
[15:12] church or amen in love by one another
[15:15] didn't john he was a man of love he
[15:18] spoke of love and he said children
[15:19] walk in love how many days that's the
[15:23] way we ought to walk walk
[15:24] in love amen
[15:28] praise be to god it's to bring stability
[15:32] the holy ghost is our regulator that
[15:35] brings
[15:36] a balance to our lives
[15:40] it brings a balance to our lives not too
[15:43] much this way
[15:44] not too much that way but right down the
[15:46] middle of the road the way that it's
[15:47] supposed to be
[15:51] now how many knows there's a lot of
[15:52] people
[15:54] even brother ben preach the message why
[15:56] are the people so tossed about
[15:58] like i said those outer courts the inner
[16:00] courts you find people that are
[16:02] on top of the mount one day and the next
[16:03] day boy i tell you what you wouldn't
[16:05] want to get around that person's
[16:08] huh we're up we're down we're in
[16:11] we're out how many knows this life is
[16:15] like a mountain railroad
[16:17] like the song says hey man you go up all
[16:20] over the mountains down through the
[16:22] valleys through the tunnels
[16:23] through the scary places through the
[16:25] swamps through the deserts
[16:29] and if you're living by every time you
[16:31] get on top of the mountain
[16:32] praise be to god you get down in a
[16:34] valley and oh
[16:35] my wow is he walls he woo
[16:40] huh we're all sad and blue
[16:44] you've never entered into the chicana
[16:46] glory what did brother branham say about
[16:49] brother neville
[16:51] question what did he say i know he said
[16:54] a lot of things
[16:56] thank you brother joe you answered the
[16:58] question give yourself a star
[17:02] he was always the same
[17:10] that's my desire lord help me
[17:13] not to be up down in out here there
[17:16] everywhere folks no the same
[17:19] all the time now that's good if it's
[17:22] good
[17:23] bad if it's bad right but i know with
[17:26] brother neville it was good because he
[17:27] was a christian that lived what he
[17:29] preached and everything else
[17:31] and he was solid and he was stable and
[17:34] kept down that middle of the road well
[17:37] i'll tell you i can't imagine having
[17:38] lived back in that time
[17:40] you know because there's a lot of people
[17:41] that tried to vote brother devil out and
[17:42] everything else
[17:43] brother branham would come in there just
[17:44] in time to say nice everybody happy with
[17:47] brother now oh yeah
[17:49] yeah and the vote went different
[17:53] huh all kinds of friction all kinds of
[17:56] this that the other
[17:58] gossip and everything else if you
[17:59] remember he says when you do those
[18:01] things
[18:01] it hurts the pastor he does that and the
[18:03] other hurt the church and all of that
[18:04] going on
[18:05] but jenny hold steady huh
[18:09] hard to hold steady
[18:12] in the midst of trials and storms
[18:16] and everything that goes on is that
[18:18] right
[18:20] oh y'all know me y'all know i ain't
[18:23] always held steady
[18:26] no i'm not always healthy but by god's
[18:29] grace hello
[18:31] the lord is working on me he's worked on
[18:34] me
[18:36] that i recognize things not just
[18:37] committed to god
[18:39] i just committed to god folks let me
[18:40] tell you something as your pastor
[18:42] folks you got to learn to commit things

[28:58] when you go home this afternoon if you
[29:00] do something that
[29:01] doesn't draw you closer to god quit
[29:04] doing it
[29:06] do something different whatever it is
[29:10] i don't know i'm not the prophet
[29:11] probably could tell you i can't know but
[29:13] you know
[29:14] what it is that you do amen
[29:18] i don't know what it is could simply be
[29:20] not taking the time
[29:21] in the morning i'll tell you what if i
[29:23] get up in the morning
[29:26] and i miss it sometime but if i don't
[29:27] get up in the morning and i appreciate
[29:29] brother joe said somebody about having
[29:30] a prayer life i believe every person
[29:33] needs a prayer life a place
[29:35] and i don't know maybe i'm funny but i
[29:37] believe even the prophet said god loves
[29:39] it when you kneel
[29:40] before him but to get down on your knees
[29:43] amen and bow before him folk we'll lay
[29:46] on our bed on the back of our pillow and
[29:48] just well
[29:48] lord hello you know come on folks have
[29:51] more respect get down on your knees to
[29:52] talk to him humble adoration to him
[29:56] not that you can't talk to him if you're
[29:58] driving down the road lord i can't heal
[29:59] right now but
[30:00] here i am lord let me talk to you pray
[30:03] everywhere
[30:04] always paul said always be praying
[30:06] everywhere lifting up holy hands
[30:09] singing and making the melody in your
[30:11] hearts
[30:12] i believe that's what we ought to do
[30:14] when we're on our jobs and go on
[30:15] different places sing a little song
[30:17] make a little humming you wouldn't you
[30:19] would be amazed at your workers to hear
[30:22] about us even humming a good gospel song
[30:25] it's good to hear somebody sing
[30:27] something for the lord
[30:28] say something for the lord do something
[30:30] for the lord
[30:33] that's the example making the melody the
[30:37] scripture says keeping in the middle of
[30:39] the road
[30:40] in this message folks we've had people
[30:41] that claim to be in the millennium
[30:43] already we've had people that claim
[30:44] we don't need a five-fold man that's
[30:46] right we don't need a church anymore
[30:49] people that have made brother branham
[30:51] god himself
[30:53] in this message and it's sad to say
[30:55] because he didn't make him an antichrist
[30:57] and they deceived themselves and i
[30:59] guarantee you people like that won't be
[31:01] there
[31:02] because god won't share his glory with
[31:03] no other
[31:05] brother brandon went off the field and
[31:07] says unless this stops i'm going off the
[31:09] field and you people will be responsible
[31:11] for all those people that could have
[31:12] come in
[31:13] you'll answer for it on the day of
[31:14] judgment hello all kinds of fanaticism
[31:18] but it doesn't take away that it's
[31:20] nothing but the truth
[31:22] how many knows jesus christ came and
[31:24] proved himself
[31:25] alive in our generation like could
[31:29] not be denied infallible and everything
[31:32] he preached was
[31:33] exactly according to the word of god he
[31:36] preached what paul preached
[31:41] lord help this church to be a middle of
[31:43] the road church
[31:44] middle of the road people and i believe
[31:47] the holy spirit is telling each and
[31:49] every one of us this morning
[31:51] are you balanced or are you out of
[31:54] balance
[31:55] do you lean too much of one or too much
[31:57] of the other i got to thinking about my
[31:59] work schedule
[32:00] and i believe i need to do like walmart
[32:02] and have some cutbacks
[32:05] we need to cut back on this and we need
[32:07] to cut back on that
[32:08] so that we have more time for god more
[32:10] time for prayer how many is with me
[32:15] all right you raised your hand well dude
[32:18] that didn't i don't know of you must be
[32:20] pretty good
[32:22] but listen how many that knows that you
[32:25] need to make some changes
[32:27] will say god i'm going to make some
[32:28] changes this week
[32:30] starting this morning
[32:34] how many believes our services will be
[32:36] different
[32:38] the atmosphere that people come into
[32:41] when they come into
[32:42] those double doors will be different
[32:45] because i am a firm believer that if a
[32:47] sinner comes walking into that
[32:49] those doors they should not just hear
[32:51] the gospel but they should feel
[32:53] the atmosphere the holy spirit should be
[32:55] so present
[32:56] until it brings conviction upon their
[32:58] heart
[33:01] amen amen
[33:05] the holy spirit can do a work in their
[33:07] life
[33:08] that's what we want to see praise the
[33:11] lord
[33:13] don't be in such a rush walk with the
[33:16] lord quit
[33:16] running so fast it's not about speed
[33:19] it's not about all that
[33:20] it's about walking with the lord and to
[33:22] be pleasing
[33:24] to him amen praise the lord
[33:29] where are you in your walk with god
[33:33] amen do you have to be primed do you
[33:35] have to pray up
[33:36] or do you come prayed up when you come
[33:38] to church
[33:39] amen you come ready to hear from god
[33:46] tell you what i thank the lord for his
[33:48] still small voice
[33:51] that's what brought me to this message
[33:52] just a still small voice
[33:55] saying we need to hear something about
[33:57] how we live
[33:59] every day
[34:06] do you need to change something hello my
[34:09] hand is up
[34:10] first lord i need to change something
[34:13] there's some things in my life
[34:15] that need to change
[34:21] because there's one objective that i
[34:24] have
[34:26] and that is to be ready when the lord
[34:29] comes
[34:31] he may come two o'clock three o'clock
[34:33] may come in the evening
[34:34] may come in the morning may come anytime
[34:36] but i want to be ready
[34:38] when he comes
[34:43] and the number one thing that you want
[34:44] to do
[34:46] is to make sure that your heart
[34:49] is pure before god amen
[34:54] how many believes that your heart has to
[34:56] be
[34:57] pure before god and i believe that's why
[35:00] the lord
[35:01] brought that to my thought about the
[35:02] other the other sunday
[35:05] with sister hope and how she came back
[35:06] from heaven she was actually there
[35:09] but i ran called her back she came back
[35:11] and she made that
[35:14] little bitty minute detail
[35:17] little bitty thing and she made that
[35:18] right
[35:20] because she wants everything right you
[35:21] and i want everything right now i
[35:22] believe that's what god is working on us
[35:25] getting us to make everything right
[35:28] there's a little something that i had
[35:31] that i had done that i hadn't confessed
[35:32] to somebody this week
[35:34] i went to that person i confessed i said
[35:36] look i want to make that confession let
[35:38] me tell you something
[35:43] you know it's hard on the flesh the
[35:46] flesh don't want to do it
[35:49] but that holy spirit in you tells you
[35:51] you ought to
[35:53] it's really not all that bad it was no
[35:56] big
[35:56] thing no major things just small but it
[35:59] was still something
[36:01] we want to be right in our hearts don't
[36:02] we how many loves the lord
[36:04] how many wants a closer walk amen
[36:11] the prophet of god knowing what he did
[36:14] just gave that lady a simple answer
[36:16] read your bible and pray more every day
[36:19] amen pray and read your body that's the
[36:21] only way to get closer to god
[36:23] is to bring that back into the center of
[36:25] his life in her life
[36:27] god bless you this morning stand with me
[36:28] if you will
[36:35] let's bow our heads

[37:04] a refreshing from the presence of the
[37:06] lord he wants to clean your heart

[37:11] that you have to give him
[37:13] your heart unreservedly you have to make
[37:16] him the center of your life again
[37:18] you have to come back to the middle of
[37:20] the road you have to bring everything
[37:22] in your life to a balance
