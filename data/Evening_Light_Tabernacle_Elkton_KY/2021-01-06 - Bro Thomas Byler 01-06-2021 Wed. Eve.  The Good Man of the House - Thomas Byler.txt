the looks of things so that'll be good amen i figured we're about in the middle of the winter just about the middle i figure october november and december amen and then we got january february and march amen so amen most of march is a little bit cold anyway isn't it amen so praise the lord amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we just come before you once again lord jesus grateful to be able to assemble ourselves together lord and no father that you have promised that you would meet with two or three wherever we gather in your name there you would be in our midst lord jesus and what a beautiful wonderful thought and to know that you're with us lord jesus here tonight father lord we realize that's lord jesus the most precious part of it all father is your presence here and we just ask god that you'll just bless the meditation of my heart father bless your word tonight anoint us just minister it father ask god that you just bless every heart and every soul father that's here both here and on the electronic world i guess it is facebook and so forth we ask god that you'd be with them lord jesus and father may the things that we hear may be more than just words but maybe father you that comes down into our hearts and our souls and transforms us from glory to glory we ask god that you'll just bless the service now help your servant to get out of the way in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord turn your bibles if you will amen i uh my wife turned on a on on a message and i was beginning to listen to what it was saying and it certainly went along with what we had talked about sunday that it just seemed to have struck a little something and so i said well i think i'll just go that direction amen because it certainly went along with what we spoke on sunday but only it might go perhaps a little deeper amen and what we did sunday was uh maybe not i wouldn't say deeper because i think all of god's word is deep but just in a little different direction amen that's something that we've all heard many times before amen and so but i trust it'll be a blessing to you tonight amen let's turn to the book of matthew i mean luke luke the 12th chapter and we'll begin with verse 35 let your loyance be girded about in your lights burning and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for the lord when he will return from the wedding then that when he who cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meet and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants and this know that if the good man of the house had known in what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through amen praise the lord may god and his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight i want to title this the goodman of the house the good man of the house brother brahm talked about where jesus was talking about when an unclean spirit goes out of a man he said when he's going out of a man that spirit walks in dry places and returns again with seven other devils is that right he says if the good man of the house isn't there to protect that house and the good man of your house is your faith if it isn't there to war him off he will come in and force himself in that life and the same power of faith that taken the devil the life out your unbelief will restore it again amen so brother man in many different places called the good man of the house faith amen and so i was listening as my wife had played that tape and i was she was listening to the message called the greatest battle that was ever fought amen and i thought sunday you know with what we had said about how that every government every church every individual is controlled or governed by only two factions amen you know i you know and just two two different things that you can be governed by one of them is fear amen which is a a something derives from or comes from unbelief or doubt in that right and so the other one is faith amen which is governed by what love is that right we know that even faith has a governor that's love but you're controlled by those two things each and every one of us amen and so brother bannon when he went and preached on the greatest battle that was ever fought of course we are very familiar with it one thing i did catch towards the end of the service was how did the lord had told him i didn't do a very detailed study of it but we know that brother madam had seen the vision and so forth that he was going to cross a river he was going to cross a lake or some great place that a canoe wouldn't cross isn't that right he was going to cross over and some others were wanting to follow him and we did you know the spirit says don't do it because if they they will try to follow you in that canoe and but abandonment is saying that you can't come there i'm the only one that can go there what all the meaning that is i don't know but he did say this i do remember this and that is that he said he says why don't you go back and store up food if you'll go back and store food they will stay there and eat on that food amen anybody said he's seen the lab one of the last things that he'd seen was that he was trying to store cabbage and all kinds of good fruit and he was just storing up a lot of good food amen so you know i don't know if it meant better band was going to cross over that he's going to go away and before he goes away needs to start food i don't know but i do know that i believe that this message even this message is part of that food that he was talking about are you with me tonight i believe that was one of the things that we store up and we can feed on it and we can enjoy ourselves and it can make us what we are to be amen now brother branham here talking about how that how that and what what he had in mind and we all to know that he talked about a solar system that he actually was looking at the stars and he was looking at the galaxies and so forth and he'd seen the stars the moon and all of the things that are in their place and how they stay in their place and as long as they stay in their place everything is nice everything is the way that it's supposed to be in other words the moon controls the tide if the moon was to shift or anything would take place the tides would come in and the earth would be covered with water there'd be chaos he said if one of those would get out of their place because one affects the other amen and so and then he went into there and of course he went in a lot of different areas but uh that was the main thought that he had and he compared also he also compared that with uh with an army that that would be god's great army that as long as every stand but he stands at their post of duty and then all of those sell that get holds everything together but if one would get out of order it would cause chaos it would be a disorder isn't that right amen so now he makes a statement he says you know uh this is a quote we're familiar with but i want to read it he says now you know we've had wars after wars and rumors of wars and if the earth stands we'll have plenty more wars amen how many knows we're having a whole lot right now it meant people battling and fighting and all kinds of stuff going on everything that goes on but do you realize there's really only two powers in the universe and all of our differences between nations and difference between each other and everything it all amounts to either two powers there's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms all the rest of the little minor things are connected to with either one of those powers and those powers are god's power and satan's power amen i like the simplicity of it don't you think everything our all of the little things in our life everything uh you know every it's all no matter how little it is it's either controlled by god's power or it's controlled by satan's power there's only two powers so he says in every war every disorder everything that comes along it's either controlled by god's power say [Music] because that's the only two powers there is that's god's power amen that's the power of life and the power of death now i like this he says lord he says if this church right tonight could we be put together and knitted together so that every person would be in one accord with not one shadow of a doubt anywhere amen there would not be a p a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes and there would be nobody here desiring the holy ghost now remember but the man says now look we're standing here right now amen we are standing at the brim right now the two powers he says the battle between faith and doubt amen they're fixing to go into rey they're fixing to go at war because for one thing there was this young lady that needed healing if she didn't get her healing she was going to die and so forth and he knew that the battle between faith and doubt that it's a battle that has been raging since the garden of eden i mean it's a battle that's been going on since the very beginning and every generation has had to face this battle had to battle this battle everybody has to either live by doubt or live by faith amen amen and ultimately either controlled by doubt or couldn't control by god's word and faith amen i my mind just went to uh every every generation especially like when jesus was here with the the scribes and the pharisees they had to choose they had to make up their mind what they're going to believe now now furthermore one thing that i the direction that i'd like to go maybe with just a little bit amen because we're also we realize that uh you could also type and if i was to type this here and look at this i mean it would be like you know because our house here our this body that you're looking at you know that this is considered or it can be looked at it as a house amen as a house or a building you know just like the goodman of the house because this is a house someone knows you are a house your body is your house if this house of this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting in other words if this house gets dissolved we haven't so we look at this house and then we know that the prophet told us that inside of this house there's many doors there's a bedroom door there's a kitchen door there's a living room door and then the private life door and all all kinds of different doors in here that's why i preached on the message doors indoor because he realized in this house there's a lot of different faction that goes along amen and so you know and i look at it because uh you know in this house in this and i looked at it even as a ship this is like a ship because how many knows that we want him to be the captain of our ship amen so and in every ship there's a powerhouse there's a place where the engine room is you know typing amen down on the inside of the inside brother bam says we're like a egg or a pulp and so forth even though you have the outer shell you have the inner shell and then you have the all the way on the inside which is the seed the soul and that right he also type us with that many different things we could type us ourselves with a vessel a vessel of honor amen that's why i said a ship it's a vessel amen and so in this here we realize that if you look at it as as being a amen that he's got to have that powerhouse amen it's got to have a a wheel where it turns isn't that right and we will not jesus on the on the wheel of our heart to turn us left turn us right or turn us whichever way we go because we want him to be the captain in that right and then there's a little rudder back there brother even even james talked about he says look at the ships and look at the rudders how great the big difference that makes just to have that little small rudder but it controls that whole ship and the direction that it goes and that's the way your life is that's the way my life is amen it depends on who's at the wheel and which way it's causing that rather to go and it's just the same with faith and doubt you know that's like the rudder whichever way you're going to go if you lean charged out guess what you're going to go towards shipwreck and then you go towards faith and it'll keep you on your destination but it's a complex situation this house is a complex house right it's it's got a lot of different factions to it amen just as the solar system does all right just as a local body does all right this house has a lot of a lot of different things about it and i want to go through it maybe with the help of the lord amen just slow down and just really maybe look at some of these things because we realize the great battle of course you know that goes on uh first of all let me just say this we realize that now i want to look at this again tonight the reason i kind of believe that the holy spirit led me to lean this way is because truly if the greatest battle that was ever fought is where not off somewhere it's there with you the battle is right with you that's what the greatest battle is is right in your mind right and then the other thing is is your greatest enemy is yourself so if the greatest battle ever took place if the greatest enemy you have is right here you don't have to look very far you ain't got to look at everything else right here is where the ballast bomb is going to be oh my brother bam he got to talking about hesis when you can get everything lined up when you can get every shadow of a doubt and everything lined up he says uk nobody need holy ghost anybody that needed healing could get it if you could get it all straightened out and lined up you get this complex ship to run the way it's supposed to run amen so we realized that the greatest battle it's the battle that was fought at the beginning now let me say this first of all satan doesn't change his tactics a whole lot huh the very that's why brother bannon listens to the end of his messages he talked about eve all the time always talking about adulterous even how did she disbelieve the word of god isn't that right and all these other all the facts you know how that he talked about leading to your own understanding and the power of reasoning amen being one of the deadliest things that the devil can use against you that the eve opened up her mind to reasoning isn't that right she opened up her mind amen and the first thing that the devil did was place in there doubt in god's word [Music] amen begin to reason now that's what changes now he knows and reasoning and i want to go through reason he mentioned conscience affections if we have time tonight if you have till 10 o'clock all right so anyway so reasoning being one of those one of those senses that we have it was an avenue or a gate but abandoned called it channels how many knows brother bob says we have a lot of channels now in this house there's a lot of what we might say doorways there's a back door there's a sideboard there's a uh you know back porch doors or each side a lot of doors that we have a lot of points of entry in this house and i would call those points of entry ck feel here and smell conscience reason memory affection amen and all those things it's all points those are all places that you've got to guard against really tonight's service it's about it it is about coming to the place that god has supreme control it's actually perhaps desiring for us to come to the place that we could get everything so lined up that these things would happen come to the place where better man talk about when you've got this amen amen you've got the good men of the house when you've got him that the faith there to watch everything it'll believe yet the devil do where he don't know what to do with you let me say this also towards the end of the sermon he brought it in beautifully how he says you know because we are really supposed to be dead the old us is supposed to be there and he talked about your conscience primary reasoning sex and all of that if any of those things ever tell you something contrary to the word of god you're to cast it out am i right because the second you open any of those up the devil came right in and as brother bam called it he'll clog up your flues or your pipes so to speak the channel in which the holy spirit can freely flow amen just like in the house you've got lines that ain't nothing worse than having a clogged line you know you can't get no water the pipes are you know froze up there they're clogged up and that's the way it is in this house amen the devil has a way to doing that amen that's what his that's how he operates amen but i'm i'm glad i'm bad for this one thing you know what i'm glad for that the thing oh my the thing that controls faith or doubt what controls faith or doubt what you feed on yeah not really what i'm looking for well i'll say this it's the seed the seed that you are amen you know it's what's way down what you really are because if you're a child of god what are you going to do you're going to believe god tried his best to get cain to believe did he get it done no because he was who he was staying in the way with judas he was born the son of perdition amen even jesus said there's children of god and there's children of the wicked one the same opportunity is given to them but the thing that's going to ultimately be dominant the thing that's going to control whether you believe or not is the seed that's on the inside amen praise the lord just sit don't get too excited because when you think about it when you think about hey i'm a believer i believe in all my heart that means i bought it oh you ought to be you gotta make you the happiest person in the world to believe that you are god's child that your son and all of god that you have the ability to believe blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for the year isn't that right he says you're blessed blessed he are they which hear the words of the prophecy of this book blessed are they that read this isn't that right those that can receive believe it are really really blessed amen this is certainly about us as christians living in heavenly places in the midst of the most evil age ever and yet the most depressing age that were that we could ever live even watching our own nation crumbling crumbling like all those other countries that we have watched crumble we're watching our country crumble all the disrespect and all of that that's all part of the crumbling isn't that right it's gonna crumble it's going to fall it's going to collapse but in the midst of it all amen we don't have our eyes on those things we've got our eyes on lord i'm looking for you to come and take me home one of these days anytime now what did jesus say blessed are those servants who are waiting and watching what do you say he said wait just be there and wait and that's what i want us to do every one of us will be ready in watching and waiting i mean there's no sense in waiting there's no sense in watching if you're not ready because you're going to miss it you got to first of all be ready and then watch and wait for him to come at any time amen praise the lord so every disorder and everything that comes along amen let's go through see takes feeling heat and smell for a minute shall we part of our house the thing that we have to learn to control how many believes that the one thing that you're going to have to do is whip yourself you have to have to overcome yourself you're going to have to come here overcome your eyes am i right now if your eyes are doing what they're supposed to do and they're not out of order amen like the song says my eyes were made to read his holy word i mean there's things that you need to look upon and there are some things that you need to turn your head from amen because if you look at the wrong thing it will bring disorder and it'll bring the devil right into your heart it'll whip you of your victory isn't that right it'll rob you of your joy just by looking at the wrong thing how many is glad to have a house i'm glad to have this house and i'm glad to have windows in this house how many knows close your eyes huh man somebody pulled the blinds down it's awful dark it is out that's right all of a sudden you just pull the blinds down and hey there ain't no look at an ain't no look and listen if what what where what kind of a world would it be you couldn't hardly have a job you couldn't go nowhere you'd have to feel everywhere with your foot isn't that right if you couldn't see how many thankful to be able to see but there's a second seeing the bible talked about not to sing but they see not eyeing eyes they don't see and so forth but understand to understand something and that's in the spirit realm to be able to understand oh i see like fan crosby she would rather brother bram she said i would a whole lot rather be naturally blind than spiritually blind but somebody asks fanny cosby i believe one time she was blind he says fanny how are you gonna how are you gonna see him how are you gonna know him when you get over there if you can't see i don't know if she had the answer right away or not but she probably went back and she began to pray about how am i going to see she probably come under inspiration she's just oh i shall know him i shall know him and redeem by sight i shall stand why shall know him i shall know him by the prince of the scars in his hand hey i'll get to feel him if nothing else she'll know him inspiration she was better off being blind and knowing god and having her eyes open amen so sight eyesight we were meant to look upon god's word amen just to be able to see what a blessing it is because we certainly couldn't contact this world properly without our eyes now all of these things was made so that we can actually function properly number two taste taste amen i guess some of them say that when you have this coconut some of you i guess experience you can't taste anything you never i can't smell or taste it huh i guess the only time you would eat would be if uh you got your summer card is growling right because you wouldn't eat it just for the taste now how many knows it you know that when you just get carried away with your taste god give us a taste because how many knows look at all the people that go to restaurants all the time look at all the good food they want to buy and they want they want it just right they want meat just i said medium rare not rare you know and boy oh boy i can't imagine trying to make everybody happy because you know all of us probably have a medium rare different yeah it's going to be a little different so it'd be hard being a cook but because we want taste has a major part in our life it's the way that we taste things and so forth but the bible says oh taste and see that the lord is good there's a spiritual tasting also amen but we are so around around the taste and most how many knows that that's pr that's why there is a disorder people have a disorder because of their taste gets away from them and they can't stop eating because it tastes so good huh a disorder because you can't stop eating him people can't stop eating hey i know when i get a little 10 extra pounds and i make more room for more it's easier to eat more hey i went into free fridge freezer today you know and i'll tell you what there's about i don't know i'm gonna tell you how much ice cream was left in that tub you know when i go to eat ice cream butter bottle has a little disorder he eats again but listen you know i mean think about it you know god give us that because if we didn't have that now notice let's go to feel we got to go a long way tonight people are in disorder about feeling because people do drugs and alcohol because why they wanna feel good how many wants to feel good how many likes to feel good it's horrible when you're sick i mean sick it's rolling up oh my it's so miserable it's a miserable time but if everybody wants to feel good amen and that's in the first realm just in the natural realm it's another door isn't that right and and i'll tell you the devil really uses on people you know that's why and that's not necessarily the reason why people drink and do all that it does perhaps give them a good feeling but we have been taught by the prophet it's because there's something on the empty on the inside amen even jesus says why do you eat things and and drink and so forth that don't satisfy come to me and i'll give you food god will satisfy you amen drink that'll quench your thirst amen here let's go with here now he knows that we're affected greatly by the things that we hear because everything that you hear goes into your mind and it has to be perhaps uh analyzed is that right you're analyzing everything is you know and if you hear something that's not quite con according to the word you're going to hear that people on the music and because of how music makes people feel amen rock and roll and all of that stuff hello well rock and roll don't really affect you let me tell you when i was out in the world uh you know because brother brown said if you don't get the holy ghost young people that rock and roll will catch you but i'm pretty much gonna say this tonight i'm gonna say that rap music some of that rap music is that right that's what's catching most people nowadays because the music has completely changed from what i understand amen from what it was in my day amen i'll tell you what we all know that when we go to a place and they're singing certain songs that you remember that that person probably has to be about 50 50 60 years old because that's what they liked they don't want all this news that's their time era that was their young age you know right and it will catch you but then says it'll catch you the things that you hear but at the same time remember this the bible says that faith comes by hearing amen hearing the word of god and it has come saying to your eardrum it also has to drop further down than just your eardrum it's got to be dropped down into your heart you got to be able to hear it but hearing amen because eve now listen faith comes by hearing and can i say this that doubt comes by hearing also doubt come by hearing because say i mean eve listened to the devil the serpent she listened to the serpent about what he had to say amen doubt came in and so let me just say this not only this but i guess we'll get it into it reasoning in memory let's get into me reasoning memory of how the devil how many knows the devil will talk to us thoughts in thought form thoughts will come into our minds amen and you have to be careful because it'll be either god's thought or it'll be the devil thought so faith comes by hearing the word smell i don't have to too much on that but you know we certainly like good smells don't we we certainly don't like bad smells but we like things for the smell good but that's just another taste let's go down to this the next five that was the outside realm that was his actual body that's this right here see taste feel hear and smell that's the outside body that's our house amen how many knows you really need faith to guard against some things because you'll go people will do crazy stuff to feel good isn't that right amen and the things that they see they want to see this they want to see that now in the other spirit realm on our in our spirit realm there's reasoning memory conscience affection and imagination amen reasoning let's go with reasoning for just a minute reasoning what actually puts you above the animal kingdom amen that's why i don't care how smart the animal is we can outsmart them they don't have the reason they have their nature that they go to whatever they do they do by nature we all know that there's a lot of animals that are a lot smarter some are that are smarter than others but they all have a routine amen but listen puts us above that it also allows us to progress scientifically amen how many knows that those lights are the product of somebody being able to think and reason figure things out amen reasoning but it's also the very thing that satan uses to bring doubt into people's minds now that's one of the you know faith doesn't have any reasoning at all i said a while ago that satan doesn't really change his tactics isn't that right and i want to say this that god really doesn't change his weaponry his weaponry never has to be improved upon god's weaponry don't never have to be improved upon amen just like faith but says get faith which is an atomic bomb that's what faith is it's the equivalent to an atomic bomb in other words it was that at the beginning it's that at the end it's always equal in power it's a superpower amen now notice so reasoning to decide or to figure it out and because eve used this reasoning in the wrong way and we you and i also every day and i want you to know how i i that this battle that we're in brother bam says that this is an every day battle that you and i face every day amen you got to have your guard up every single day you have to have that faith there in every one of these channels if faith isn't there to watch out to make sure it's according to the word is it according to the word or isn't it amen if it isn't and if you slack up the devil will slip right in and he'll get you you'll be you'll defeat it but ibrahim says you know if you uh if to eve to disbelieve one word took her to death amen and if and it disarmed her not only disarmed but it also took away her shield her protection and i talked about that because this good man of the house remember what he does he protects he's a protector i mean believes faith is a protector it keeps you protected from all kinds of harm even death taking the shield of faith where with ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen how do these fiery darts come in here by the things that you may not need to look at amen things that you don't need to feel amen things you don't need to hear reasoning that you don't need to do god's word said cast down reasoning let me just read this real quick like in uh ii corinthians this is paul's version of of uh our battle with the flesh or in the spirit realm for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds how many knows that everything that we've mentioned about there if you look at the world and the condition that it puts the people in you realize that these are really strongholds your eyesight's a stronghold your mind's a stronghold your reasoning is a stronghold amen your conscience is stronghold your hearing is a stronghold and satan wants to get in there casting down imagination and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of god brother bound says if your conscience your memory your e-reasoning he says they're all wonderful they're all good in their place but if one of those tells you one thing contrary to word throw it out that's what paul was saying here bringing every thought captive every high thing that exalts us if it's against the knowledge of god everything imaginations and so forth remember let i'll just i'll just jump to imaginations for a second imagination the bible says that in the days of noah god looked down and the imagination of man's heart was wicked continually always thinking the wrong things imagining things thinking the wrong how many believes it's important to think the right thing anytime you think the wrong thoughts it's disorder and it brings what chaos amen imagination so now look at that now the other thing i want to do a little bit with memory and conscience memory either comforts us because memory has to do with the past i mean his memory has to do with past i'll tell you what i got memories that i hate to think i don't even try to think about it you know the only one to think about it i'm sure you do too and i try not to because it's all under the blood make sure it's all under the blood amen but our past has a lot to do with our conscience now how many knows that brother bram talked about he says you know a woman sometimes they'll say well it don't it don't it bother my conscience to wear pants to smoke could do it don't bother me what did he say she's got no more conscience than the snake has hips so in other words some people i know some people have their conscience seared you know it's that something down there that tells you you know that you shouldn't have snapped at your wife like that that you shouldn't have done this little thing you know shouldn't have done that little thing and and your conscience always brings up your memory sometimes look at what you did huh and you know it makes you feel terrible you know so you got to watch it isn't that right but people don't have a conscience anymore i don't understand it but brother ma'am talked about how that that woman who had uh he was supposed to be a christian she ended up leaving her husband for the nice salesman that comes along this side of the other and she was still in the church this data the other and so forth you know come down to the end of the road and realize she was not saved huh brother bram says that she had grieved her soul away why everybody you know some people just don't seem to have a soul they ain't got soul like hitler how could he have had a soul huh this is just to make you wonder a little bit but i believe the father god said that serpent he had a place for the soul but he didn't have a soul and cain was the son of him but anyway think about it grieve that's all the way because we're the soul is what gives you feeling it's what gives you a compassion because some people just it says man they can do any horror thing and it doesn't bother them look at the teenagers nowadays going into school doesn't even bother them to shoot anybody where did they lose some of their sensitivity on those games seeing the blood splatter everywhere when they see it they don't think nothing of it you know what that one thing i find though you know what i find from these mass murders and everything they don't want the death penalty i'll make an agreement just let's not have the death penalty they want to kill everybody else but they're afraid of death themselves huh that's sad isn't it but people don't have a conscience for god now i'll tell you right now how many knows that all of these things should be right tuned in with god and protected by the good man of the house because god is not in our feeling how about feeling did i miss one yeah feelings cheetahs feel but we'll talk about feeling people don't have any feelings for each other anymore the bible says that they would uh be without natural affections just natural affections like families they don't have feelings for each other anymore but says the neighbors we aren't neighbors like we used to be people aren't close to each other anymore but the bible says be kindly affectionate one to another i'm if the church of god ought to have a lot of love a lot of compassion a lot of a lot of feeling for each other amen because if not it's a disorder why do you think uh oh my it isn't it's just absolutely terrible of the the families that are you know and the moms and dads and the murderers that's going on with their own family members people don't have no love of any more they don't have god anymore do you talk about disorder because why satan got in there not faith they're operated by doubt and fear and not by faith so conscience amen and memory their precious thing to us because i think i've i've heard of people that most anybody most anybody that has went off to war and has had to kill people i mean everyone in there was hopefully nobody has had to kill somebody because you might think it was just maybe it was i don't know you might it depends on what justice it was it was to fix and kill somebody else whatever it might be but that would that goes on your conscience you know right amen and uh what is what do they call a post-traumatic stress syndrome or something you know because of the stress because of that sometimes people you know soldiers and so forth they'll wake up in the middle of night screaming or whatever and oh man it can bother you for a lifetime your conscience is a very very precious thing that's why it's so important that that conscience that you have is right with god then you can have you can go to bed and snore like a baby you can get up in the morning and say thank you lord jesus hallelujah it's a wonderful day huh but if you've got things that you've done don't if you've done things wrong if you've got a lot of things that you've done wrong that is on there unless you get it under the blood of jesus christ and you know that it's forgiven you so many believes that our conscience has to be in tune with god i'm here to tell you something god is sensitive the holy spirit is sensitive i mean god is perfect right there's no evil in him at all he's sensitive so much so that brother branham when the beginning of his discernment begin to take place he says now for everybody don't go out and go out the doors and back and forth and he says he's sensitive amen don't just keep real still real quiet let him operate i believe that's the way our lives should be just be real still be real quiet be sealed in god be hid in christ all of these areas listen this is what you are you are seeking your conscience reason memory and all of that and every bit of that has to be hid in god in other words so sealed in god the devil can't get in there because you know that part of the devil not knowing what to do with you how many wants to be live in the place where the devil just don't know how to get at you amen because we know you know the phrase some out boy he did something that just got to me he got to me yeah that's right the devil found you he found where you were still alive he was found where where your place is that hey that's that's where you lose it that weak link brother bam talk about in the statue of a perfect man amen praise the lord okay and also of course that's memory the things that we remember and i'll tell you what the best memory i have is what i remember about god amen what a glorious thing going down memory lane sometimes think of what god has done for me amen where he brought me from ice held onto me how he's kept me great things affection we won't stay on this very long this is the last of this but infection people don't have natural affections anymore they don't just have common decency anymore they don't love each other like they should do anymore amen people are hollowed out so to speak there's so many people and i believe this is with elvis presley it's with uh what was his name michael and michael different ones that odd overdraw on drugs and everything they were so empty inside they had no feeling you realize that people will almost put themselves in physical pain just to try to feel something people don't feel anything anymore that's how far away from god they've gotten so far away from reality so from far from being able to feel for anybody think nobody feels for them it'd be a terrible place to live but that's where satan has got them remember this satan's army he says brings diseases that's what he is he's a destroyer satan's whole kingdom is a kingdom of sickness and death and sorrow and frustrations and worry it's all of satan god is life and faith and joy and peace on the other side and listen god's army and god's army is commissioned to cast satan's diseases and everything out there you are every time satan throws something on to you god's army is to cast him out amen cast it out that's the very tactic that god uses kate satan used the army of destruction to disbelieve god's word to set him up a better kingdom than michael had god cast him out his method is to cast out cast down region cast down superstition cast down worry cast down disease cast down sin amen you're above it you're resurrected in jesus christ and setting in heavenly places with every devil under your foot glory how many is glad to be there i hope you're there tonight amen you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus you're hid you're you are dead and your life is hitting christ the devil don't know how to find you he tried your eyesight he tried church he takes the other he may try every avenue and he just can't get to you that's how we need to be how many believes that we need to have every one of those things guarded have that good man of faith right there standing there guarding so that the devil has no avenue in having done all to stand stand therefore having your long and scared about with truth and heaven on the breastplate of faith and so forth paul said he says once you get there it means stand there and as i get older as i get older i mean there's a lot of those feelings and emotions and things that i don't have to deal with as much as what you did as a teenager as a teenager and as a young person you'll find out that your emotions are erratic sometimes now they're just way out there you got to get control of them you got to get control of this feeling you got to get control of this emotion huh because you're on fire amen and if you don't pray a lot and keep faith there amen you better watch out because satan is a destroyer even the bible says that the enemy comes in not but to kill and to steal and to destroy that's what jesus said that satan does that's the only thing he knows to do is to come in and make the world look like it is there's you know it's hard to find people that are the same that stay the same huh everybody's changing families changed churches changed individuals saying people change all the time but i guarantee you if you're in christ you'll change into a better person but you're not going to change into something worse a worse person no a church the same way look at where the churches have gone why because in one of those avenues the devil let's come in come into reasoning you know this that or the other and and wade people are coming out completely different than what you used to be like i said this is about standing having done all to stand stand there for having the goodman of the house watch in closing i want to talk about two things our families and a local church body a local church body like us in a family it's important the father of any family does his very best to do what keep unity keep the family together keep the family loving one another is that right how many knows that's hard thing to do it's a hard thing for a mom or a dad to do and a lot of times it don't work why because if those children aren't consecrated to god one of those feelings one of those places is gonna it's gonna become a problem huh it's gonna cause people to separate it's gonna cause hard feelings to come in and families don't talk and everything else for the longest time sometimes and different things because of a lack of control a lack of a surrendered heart to almighty god how many of us that's why it's so important that's why church is so important a pastor's job is to cause every family a bunch of different families to stay in love to stay together how many knows that this job isn't the being a pastor isn't easy having a church isn't easy there's a there's a local body which is what is what we are but then there is the body of christ now he knows the body of christ is not local it may be there partially local but the body of christ is universal all over the world is the body of christ and only those that have been baptized into the spirit by one spirit are we all baptized into one body you have to be born again of the spirit of god to be a part of that church to be a part of that body how many believe that i was listening to something the other day that i thought that would be a blessing to us so i'm going to read that in closing is this okay it's about a local church like us and i thank god i want to tell you things i thank god for what god has done for us and what he does for us every day amen for the love that we feel for each other amen for the holy spirit that we sense and that we feel coming down in our services how many hours we feel that we feel it tonight we felt it sunday amen and and listen to what brother brahm says i i i i was listening to a tape and i ran across this and i said boy with what i have said the last few weeks i said i got to read this to the church and this will help us amen if this was in if you want to if you want to read it brother brandon i i should play the tape and let him say it but i'm going to read it the super sense the super sense 1959 12 27 but abandoned he was coming back and he says listen my darlings in the gospel my stars in my crown if i shall have one the purchase of the blood of jesus i did this for a purpose coming back like this and he talks about the local body about those who have taken communion those who you know to be christians that love the lord amen and strive to serve god and i'll read that in a minute he says look after making my own consecration and after making heaven the church to do so if god blessed us the way that he has the last few meetings with a little consecration what will he do if we keep it up listen what he says just keep it up how many knows when you've made your stand where you extremely life to god it's a job to stay there to keep it up keep pressing on because if you do and if you got that a good man in the house there the devil can't come in he can't distract you you won't be one person or a christian now and then the next day you'll be gone it'll stop this you know why can't people keep the victory and so forth listen keep it up now listen you're in love with one another how i've seen you standing in the house this morning and just weep and your hands up to god that lovely spirit moving around and over you amen then brother baby says listen now don't you listen to one foul thing the devil's got to say he starts telling us how that we can remain in the holy spirit as a local church body don't listen to what the devil's got to say see if the devil shows you some or tells you something evil about one of the members of the body of christ don't you believe it amen for as soon as you do believe it you might mar your experience now you might say well brother what if it's really true listen to what you do then he says right after that if you see one of the members of the body of christ doing something evil don't tell nobody the bible tells me that he that hides his sin shall not you know be blessed but he says don't tell nobody but amen go to that member and with love and see if you can't bring them back to christ again how many knows that anything outside of that it'll cause chaos the devil anything outside of that if you listen to somebody because we always want somebody else to do our job well i know somebody's doing something wrong why don't you go take care of it no if you know something you go take care of it if you can't listen to what it says and if you don't can't do it then tell one more person and let them go with you see that's the scriptural way amen listen to me church you know i'm thankful we don't have a lot of problems here i'm very glad for that but if there was i want you to know exactly what you're supposed to do amen because it's how many knows in order for anything to be bla it's got to be according to the word of god anything else now outside of that is going to give room the devil to slip in and the devil and brother brandon will tell you here in a minute all right then then listen but don't he don't finish it if somebody says you know sister so-and-so and father so-and-so don't you believe one word of it just let it go because remember it's the devil trying to tear you to pieces now when we go to one another hey you know so-and-so remember it's the devil trying to tear you to jesus is this all right because remember and now notice now just look just look for him to come because he'll do it how many knows that when you've got harmony in a family you got harmony in the church and the holy spirit the devil's not happy when we're raising our hands and we're shouting we're praising you remember the devil isn't mattering he don't like it at all he's he is a miserable creature the devil is a miserable creature and he wants your company he wants my company misery wants company the devil wants company he wants somebody to be best bro miserable amen go look for him to come because he'll do it now you let the good man of the house faith stand right there amen and don't you receive one thing these people that has said you have set with in heavenly places with you fellowship together around the blessings of god taking the communion at the table the holy spirit has witnessed that they are the children of god so let's just be real sweet and kind-hearted forgiving and loving amen so if you'll notice he talks about people like we know each other how many knows we know each other and if we know that one of us is evil we're going to know that but if we have taken communion and we know that we're christians and so the devil will do let me just say this the devil will do everything in his power to cause you to try to believe that your brother is evil or your sister is actually evil the devil will try to make you think of your brother or your sister as evil amen but remember be sweet be kind-hearted forgiving loving let me just say this is a pastor i believe if we would do that if we see a sister i've when i've talked to people my wife's done it when you see a sister sometimes maybe or it's just not dressed appropriate it bothers you he said our sister shouldn't do that she's got little girls watching and everything take her to the side sister just you know that you're not you know you know and just say it love and sweetness if you say it love and sweetness come on folks we can all handle that right somebody says something sweetly kindly and not me come on folks right praise the lord isn't that the truth same with us brothers we should be able to go to each other say brother you know you pull the fast one on me you shouldn't have done it or or whatever it might be say yeah and we got to be honest yeah that's right and admit it again and that's that'll be the end of it it'll all be straightened out get onto the blood because if you don't you go to the second person and somebody really doing evil hello they're really doing evil and won't repent it's supposed to be brought before the church they don't hear the church they say hey he's not a christian his brother's not a christian he will not repent that's how it's supposed to be done amen and i guarantee you if it's a genuine brother i don't believe he'll go that far amen but listen to what he says again you with me now so now notice witness that they're kind of forgiving loving because the devil likes to get in every avenue and if listen and if that person talks evil against you maybe there's maybe somebody in the church they're saying something evil about you you talk sweet brother brahm said against them but it be towers them right watch how much sweeter it comes to you then see that's right just always return good for evil i have taught that fear for eons of time because i'll be honest with you i haven't always been able to practice it huh that's right but the lord's worked on me i've got to believe i've gotten to the place to where hey you know you think bad say bad whatever you call me that's fine i'm gonna go pray for you because i ain't got room to open up for the devil to come in here and bring bitterness in my heart no because that's the exact channel that the devil uses so many times young people especially listen that he'll use that channel to get to you and cause you to be disturbed to upset you have you ever heard the word upset i thought about the word said well i'm upset if you get upset remember it's the devil that upsets you god don't upset you the devil upsets you amen we shouldn't get upset we should stay on our feet amen all right so now i know just talk real sweet back to them that's right just always return good for evil love and so forth now he says he's talking about a little girl are you feeling better about now notice what he says now brother bam says in closing she says now be sure to do that pledge yourself that to god god by your grace that's what i will do how many is with me god with your help i pledge myself that that's what i will do if i see a brother or sister amen and they aren't doing like they ought to do i'll be able to go in kindness and in love and seeing brother you shouldn't do that sister you shouldn't do that amen but i won't come to somebody else and somebody else and spread it around because the devil gets into all of that because ain't no time you've got that as the evil person when they're not and when you do that remember this brother bam says the person that is doing that is the one that is wrong i'll say this i believe that whatever most of the time and i've seen it happen as a pastor when that happens the person doing it is twice as wrong and bad as whatever the person that's doing it amen it's a wicked it's bad it can it gives room for a wicked spirit to come in and i know none of us want that amen no matter what anybody says evil return good don't think evil if you think evil then you just keep consecrating yourselves to god until you can really feel good powers that person glory i know we all want to be there get to the place because if you you know the the thing if it is is we want to get to thinking evil or or thinking bad and so forth and then we're the ones that end up feeling bad it gives the devil room to come and get you that's how the devil he comes and gets you and if but if you just love and if you just return good for evil he can't touch you what are you going to do with that ain't nothing the devil can do when you do that amen okay so i thought this was amen good now listen another thing so you just keep consecrating yourself until you feel good touch that person that's the way to do it then the sweetness of god's blessing will just oh it'll just cover your soul how many wants that that's the way to live victorious and nothing can harm you as long as you're in love and don't only love those who love you but love those who don't love you for it's easy to love anybody that loves you but try to love somebody who doesn't love you that's where you can test whether you're a christian or not somebody that don't love you and yet in your heart you love them if you don't do that just keep holding on to god it's there i know that to be the truth amen praise the lord all right you love the lord tonight how many wants to go there how many wants to be in that place where you know the devil just can't touch you you're waiting for the hou you've got your house control you've got all your guards up the devil can't come and find you he can't get to you he can't touch you why because you're hitting christ no matter what comes or goes you stay right there no matter what anybody does you don't ever build up a grievance or a complex against them amen and no matter what the devil tempts you with even in your body's realm or your spirit realm whether it's memory or whatever it might be it's all guarded by the goodman of the house an evening like tabernacle and the saints there i'll tell you what what i what i'm hoping for and believing for that we will all be swept up all of us i want every one of us to have a body change and just go in the air and meet the lord in the air that's that's my goal for us and i believe that this message that god sent us through a prophet and these messages that he has given us is molding us and shaping us and sooner or later we're going to come to it how many believe that the token one of these days we're going to have the token life and nothing but amen we're going to have perfect love just like he said we're going to be watching and waiting for the coming of the lord because he's going to come because this nation is crumbling it's falling apart brother branham preached the world falling apart and i truly remember seeing it face to face that the world is falling apart and i'll tell you what we need a lift we need a body change and in order to have that body change first god has the changes in here amen amen amen praise the lord god bless you musicians if you'll come if everybody wants to stand greatest battle ever fought greatest enemy that you have amen in the greatest battle you'll ever fight is in the mind with our hearts and heads bowed remember this every reasoning that you have every conscience and every memory every feeling that you have it all has to come up into the mind and that's where the battle is is what are you going to do with it what are you going to do with it when it comes into your mind you feel this way you remember this you think this or whatever it might be that's the big battle because what you do with it right there determines what kind of person you're going to be whether it's going to be out of fear and doubt frustration or whether it's going to be peace and joy by faith in almighty god with our heads about how many knows tonight would admit that you really need to do a better job with this battle that you're facing every day that every conscience every memory every reasoning that comes your way everything that you can learn to commit it to god and and keep it right according to the word god bless those hands my hand is up lord jesus now we come before you lord and we do believe that you're doing a work in every one of our lives lord and father you're getting us to a place lord jesus that we'll be ready to meet you father and lord tonight we're here raising our hands lord both here and on the face book and so forth lord we're raising our hands and saying god tonight we want from this night on we want the goodman of the house to stand at every door and keep the devil out keep evil out it doubt out cast it all out so that lord jesus we can truly live a victorious life lord jesus in the blessedness of almighty god so the lord when we have services where your holy spirit comes and and that love we feel lord jesus it never has to change we can have that all the time we can keep that going lord that's what we desire father and we ask in your precious name god that you would cause this church lord each one of us lord that we would be more kindly affectionate one to another by the holy ghost lord your prophet has taught us lord that as we love one another and serve one another is how we serve you because you are in our brother and our sister lord as we have done unto the least of these we have done unto you lord and we ask tonight that we would go from here lord much people than when we came lord jesus that we go from here and that we would analyze everything lord that comes our way lord comes knocking on our doors whether it's of god or whether it's not and if it's not we'll shut the door and say this is not ours it's not mine take it back send it back where it came from we asked god that you'd ever draw us closer to you now in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you brother
