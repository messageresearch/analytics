morning all right if we'll just go in the psalms the children children can be dismissed for sunday school if we'll go to psalm 71. psalm 71 and we're going to read from verse 13 to the end of that psalms there psalm 71 starting in 13 let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt my mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for i know not the numbers thereof oh god thou has taught me from my youth in hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works the righteousness also o god is very high who has done great things o god who is like unto thee thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my soul which thou has redeemed my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for their brought unto shame that seek my hurt god bless you may be seated for brian good morning brothers and sisters you know you go to the doctor and he fixes you up and a couple of days later you go out there and work and you tear it all up again so uh if you return with me to the fourth chapter of second corinthians before i get started you know the thing about that psalm from last week and this week if david is david isn't looking at his problems or his circumstances he's looking to the god of his savior and the god of heaven he's praising god no matter what the circumstances he was in wherever he was at he wasn't looking there but he was looking forward to the god and what how great his god was and how great his god the things he could do for him he wasn't looking at his problems and a lot of times you know your enemy that's what he wants you to do he wants you to focus on all the bad things going on in your life all the problems whether they're physical things financial things personal things his goal is to get you to focus on those things instead of the focus on your god and not jesus christ his whole goal is to get you to worry about things that you really can't control or have no control over and a lot of times you spend your whole life worrying after things that you have no control over and you'll find out that sometimes you're going to come short because you are worrying about the wrong thing but as i get started here brother thomas asked me to talk about where we're at as church when it comes to the loan payment and this is the this is the last one i paid so when i got making the principal and the interest payment so uh we started some of you we started at 200 000 and uh what we're down to right now is 69 387 and 89 cents basically we're down to 69 and 400. that's what we have left on principle so if i confuse some of you i apologize so our normal interest payment based on that excuse me our our normal interest payment based on that principal amount is anywhere from 239 depending on the time of the month to 300 a month but with what we have left in principle the best way i know how to explain this and break it down if i just paid the the monthly amount that i'm required to pay which is anywhere from 10 70 to 10 50 that would leave 64 payments left on the church based on that principal amount which is five years and four months but i i do pay more than the normal amount depending on what the general fund is at that time so i've been usually been able to make anywhere from fifteen to sixteen hundred dollars a month in the at the monthly payment i make which would which would reduce the [Music] to pay off the loan right now if we just if i just kept doing it the way i'm doing it right now would be three years and nine months basically four years from now the the church loan property would be paid off and that's assuming that everything is okay and uh and that was based again on that sixty four thousand dollars but some of you are smart enough to know you're going to think well as you pay principal your interest at the end of the loan changes and that's true but i'm just using ballpark figures here so basically if we don't do anything and i pay the usual extra what for about four years left if i were just something were to happen i could just barely meet the payment it would be five years and four months i just threw some numbers out so let's say we um if i were tomorrow were to pay ten thousand dollars off on the principal amount that we have right now and you just have to use your little calculators in your mind that would leave 59 400 to pay again if i just did the minimum payment that would be four years and seven months left to pay the loan off and then if i pay the normal amount the fifteen hundred dollars a little extra i pay it would be three years and three months left and then i just threw another number out there if we were to pay tomorrow or a month from now 20 000 off the principal amount and bringing it down to you know uh fifty thousand dollars that would leave three years and nine months paying the normal payment two years and eight months if paying what that i did pay and of course you got to remember it's actually going to be paid off a few few more months even earlier than that because the interest that they're charging on that amount changes and uh when we first took the loan out it was a slight floater it right now we're uh we're paying four and four and a quarter interest right now uh on the loan like i said we uh the maturity date is uh august 2030 uh with like i said well well ahead of that time right now if you've got questions don't be afraid to ask me about this um and i also wrote down what we had in the on this sheet of paper here right now on the general front of the church right now we have uh about uh ten thousand and five hundred dollars uh there are some there is a little bit left over from the uh missionary there's probably about a thousand dollars of that that is missionary funds that people have put into the offering not dedicated to you crane that would come out of that amount and some other things that have to be done out of that amount but mostly that's what we have available and as a treasurer i try not to met i try to keep the general fund as close to that as i can so i and like i've told you before in the summer time i you never know what could happen you know things are expensive nowadays i know everyone says that but you you really whatever you do for a business you know that things have really changed in the last 18 months on what things cost you'd be surprised on if you hadn't done something in a couple of years and want to do it today and pay for it you'd be surprised at how the cost of things have changed in the last 18 months but uh like i said if you have any questions uh don't be afraid to ask me uh i know i say that a lot but i don't mean to be funny about it but just going back to the scripture not taking a lot of time i was reading some devotionals this morning uh i'm probably going to go off my point i was reading some things and i was reading what brother branham had to say this morning in the devotional and i was reading what other people had in their devotionals and they kind of tied together brother branham was talking about the state of the church or the state of the country in in his time frame you know the late 1950s or early 1960s you know i i wasn't that old in that time frame i was just a young man and i was thinking how he was talking about how the women were doing and how the country was doing even back then in in the 1960s and i was just thinking sometimes we take for granted what he's telling us he prophetically he's looking forward to the age that we live in right now and some of it as you get older some people realize you didn't think you would we'd be in a country that's at this state this morning that we're in but it should give you hope it should make you go further into christ not further away from christ if if you find the circumstances that you're seeing in the world today are are making your experience or questioning your foundation then there's something wrong with it to begin with and you need to go back to that bedrock itself where you started from but let me uh read here what it has to say in corinthians i'm not wanting to take a lot of times in and i was uh i'm just going to jump and read something else here i had it marked i don't know if i can find it no i took it out yeah i'll just read a few scriptures out of uh out of galatians you don't have to turn there fifth chapter uh it's one of the chapters that paul one of the epistles i like the most but i'll just read a few of these verses out of uh chapter five of galatians this is paul speaking here stanfast therefore in the liberty worth christ had made you free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage and of course we know he's going to go on later in this chapter and talk about the act of circumcision and paul was trying to explain to the jewish church that that circumcision we have now as christians is not in a physical sense but it's in the spiritual sense where you're circumcised in your heart to the things of god and he goes on and stands as therefore in the liberty whereas christ had made us free and being out of tangible again with the yoke of bondage paul saying to you that if you be circumcised christ profits you nothing and he's going on to say whatever you put i'll just finish at that person let me jump over here to second corinthians the fourth chapter therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not and we don't want to faint be but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftedness or handling the word of god deceitfully by the manifestations of the truth commending ourselves to every man conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it's hit to them that are lost you know you you can talk to people all you want if god doesn't put a light on that seat to those people that you're talking to they'll just keep going the way they're going you can't make someone become a christian you can't make someone change but god can do it if you put your hope and trust in a living god and i'll just read a few more and sit down but if our gospel head is hit to them that are lost to whom the god of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not at least the light of this glorious gospel of christ which is the image of god should shine on to them and he's he's talking about the people he's around at that time but you know today in the world that we live in you talk about the gospel the people you talk about jesus christ before you know they'll be in conversations totally off the word of god but it's a it's just the age that we live in right now it's it's unconsecrated age people don't want to go that extra mile they don't want to get into that baptism of the holy ghost but they push out the things of the world that only the things of christ divide in their hearts and lives so as we go further in this year and the years that are going to come i i know i say it a lot i can't say it enough your only hope is if your heart your life and who you are is in head in jesus christ this morning anything outside of that if you're hoping for anything else outside of that then you're going to be lost i mean you're going to be disappointed let's put it that way you know there's nothing wrong as a young you know i was a young man one time i can only speak you know you desire certain things there's nothing wrong with that as a young man but if those hopes are replacing jesus christ in your life then you're going to be a miserable person if you put everything if you put everything that you are in jesus christ this morning god will add those things that he wants you to have or the things you desire but being they'll be in the time that god wants them for you and not what you're pushing for you know i can say that because i'm an older man and i know that i've spent some times in my life pushing forward in things that they don't mean anything you know maybe it wasn't something i should have pushed that forward in to doing but everything we do this morning or anything that i do i want god to lead me in it and not be my own strength but his strength that's leading me brother david you love him this morning let's stand if we could and appreciated that this morning and i don't know about you but that little course was saying all my hope is in jesus this morning listen that if we could amen i know my hope is in jesus yes oh thank god my yesterday's gone and all my sins are forgiven oh i've been washed by the blood once again this morning and all my whole visit jesus oh thank god my yesterday's gone and all my sins are forgiven [Music] oh i've been watched by the amen you're thankful you've been washed by the blood every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before and every day with jesus oh it's sweeter than the day before [Music] every day with jesus oh i love him more and more lord jesus saves and keeps me and he's the one i'm waiting for oh every day with jesus it's sweeter than the day before once again oh and every day with jesus oh it's sweeter than the day before and every day with jesus i love him more and more for jesus saves and keeps me oh he's the one i'm waiting for and every day with jesus is is that how you feel in your heart this morning oh and every day with jesus boy sweeter than the day before and every day with jesus oh i love him more and more for jesus sake than keeps me and he's the one i'm waiting for and every day with jesus [Music] amen amen you believe that with all your heart you may be seated this morning god bless you it's good to see each and every one out this morning it's it's good to have brother gary with us this morning and appreciate him being here and brother russell and sister elizabeth this morning and man all you hum folks god bless you this morning and it's just good to be in the house lord i i don't know about you but uh how many was here wednesday night and enjoyed wednesday night service i'll tell you i just i have been just rejoicing over the goodness of god and the testimonies and you know what was really outstanding to me and you know the bible talks about we need to be as a little child as bill troy's daughter testified and said brother branham was talking to her and you know we can't get nothing from god if we're not listening for him to talk to us this morning and i i thought you know lord and then i began to think about brother perry green he said that brother brandon spoke to him that morning he said because when brother brandon come out to preach he said good morning friends he said i considered myself his friend and i thought you know lord i want to be your friend this morning and i just so appreciate you this morning this just just love him just been thinking about it and i thought lord you know there's just nothing like expressing what god does for you and sometimes you know you say well why should i tell someone it helps them it gives them courage it gives them strength because when they're down they can say brother tommy look what god done for him if he'll do it for him he'll do it for me hey so that's you know we just got to keep pressing on and amen so i pray the song service is going to be a blessing to you this song it is mine god's abiding peace do you have that up this morning brother micah because i don't they don't have the words to that and i don't want to sing by myself on that this morning if we could amen well god's abiding peace is it my soul today yes i feel it now yes i feel it now he has taken all my doubts and fears away though i cannot tell you how his name he has given peace perfect peace to me it is my i'm fine blessed be his name mindful eternity and he has wrought in me a sweet and perfect rest my raptured heart i can

oh i have it now to his praise i will my ransom powers employ and read it [Applause] [Music] his name he has given peace [Music] [Applause] [Music] his name mine for all the eternity and oh the love of god is comforting my soul for his love is mine yes his love is my place of joy and gladness for my spirit role helping me with life davine well it is mine yes mine blessed be his name he has given peace perfect peace to me it is my blessing be his name mine for all please sing that last verse again if we could i know the love of god is comforting my soul for his love is mine yes his love is my ways of joy and gladness or my spirit with my device where it is peace perfect peace to me oh it is mine it's mine [Music] for all amen aren't you thankful for that this morning amen amen let's sing

go through struggles every day but i'm so glad that he's with me everywhere that we go he knows whatever we have need of this morning and he's just an awesome god this morning i just can't brag enough on our lord jesus this morning and my and most of all he saved our soul when we was lost when we were unworthy he loved us this morning i remember when i was a very unlovable young man but i'm so thankful that god didn't look at who i was in the flesh but he looked at what he remembered me to be this morning amen i'm so glad he abides this morning well i'm rejoicing night and day oh as i walk this narrow way for the hand of god in all my life i'd see oh and the reason of my bliss yes the secret all is this that the governor abides [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah with me oh i'm

fell down at his feet and there came a piece so sweet now the comforter about with me where he [Music] [Applause] [Music] as i walk this narrow way for the comforter bites with me i like this verse for he is with me everywhere and he knows my every care i'm as happy as ever and just as free [Music] for the spirit has control jesus satisfies my soul oh with me oh i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk this narrow way for the comforter about with me now there's no thirsting for the things of this world they've taken wings long ago [Music] and instantly all my night was turned today all my burdens rolled away fights with me [Applause] hallelujah with me i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk this snare away for the copter about are you glad he advised to smoke [Applause] oh i'm rejoicing

choice left up to me yes there's a cross standing between me and forever if i go down i'll have to pass right by that tree yes if i go down i have to pass right by that tree amen russell with us we're gonna ask brother russell if he'll come and sing for us this morning i told him he hadn't been to visit for a while and he's he's getting like the rest of us his memory is not too good so amen he's a grandpa several times over so that does affect you god bless you coming back real soon though be here next month for hope's wedding so good to see us twice in a row well david brother david caught me when it came in the door i hadn't even thought about singing and i know i should probably think about it because he does it every time but and then i'm sitting in the pew and audrey said i'll sing with you and that's really rare i mean rare as hen's teeth so we're i'm happy that she's gonna sing this song eat as well with my soul everyone knows but if you give me just a minute i could give you the story behind it as best i can recall it's been a long time since i read it but i remember as a young man knowing horatio spafford was inspired to sing this because he lost a little girl at sea there and when he crossed that spot that's when he received inspiration but there's more to it and you all may know i'm sorry if it's something you're familiar with but when i heard the whole story it's very pretty incredible and it started with her ratio had of one boy and three girls and he lost his little boy it to it was some kind of i don't some kind of a sickness that lost a little boy when he was just a young guy i don't think he was even maybe three years old but he lost his son and then just radon it was one thing after another raid on the heels of that be kind of like the trials of job you know just one after another but right on the heels of that losing his boy was the great chicago fire and that was 1871. horatio spafford was a businessman in chicago and he had a lot of holdings right on the lake front there and everything he had was burnt to the ground all the commercial buildings and everything that he owned was destroyed in that great chicago fire so they planned to just to kind of get away from they were still grieving from having lost their boy and then the great fire and so just to get away he was taking his family and they were going over to england to be in services with dwight moody actually and so they had booked their passage on the ship and the day before they were to leave on their on the ship he the city commissioner came to his door and said tomorrow we're having a meeting to determine property rights on the lakeshore and horizon said well i won't be here i'm leaving with my family and the gentleman said if you're not here we can't guarantee that you'll own anything when you get back if you're not here to show us the maps and tell us what belongs to you and so horatio sent his family on ahead the next day and he said i'll follow on the following ship the next day or the next whenever the next one sailed but that ship then that had his wife and three daughters on was in a in in the fog and and crashed into another ship i believe it went down it was incredible maybe 12 minutes that the ship sank and horatio received a telegram when the when the people that were rescued were rescued from his wife and she said saved alone so his three daughters all perished in that so out of those kind of hardships you know comes that's where we get this song it's 150 years old now but he boarded ship then the next ship that sailed and he asked the captain to please call him when they passed the spot where his daughters lost their lives and so it was two in the morning when the captain called him from his room and he went up and stood on the rail of the ship it was the atlantic ocean looking out over the cold atlantic and and this is the spot where his daughters perished and this is when at that moment the inspiration for this song came to racial spafford when peace like a river attendeth my way and in the good times he said when sorrows like sea billows roll whatever my lot whatever lot we have in life we can say it as well with our soul [Music] hallelujah well when peace attendeth my way or when sorrows like sea billows [Music] thou hast taught me to [Music] with my soul [Music] [Music] it is well it is well with my soul [Music] and though satan [Laughter] [Music] [Music] control for that christ hath regarded i have hath shed his own blood for my soul it is [Music] of this [Music] it is a nail to the cross and i bear it no more praise the lord praise the lord all my soul last verse but the lord is for thee for thy coming the sky not the grave is [Applause] of my soul [Music] [Music] [Music] my soul [Music] bless you buddy hey man let's stand and sing that oh is well with my soul it is well it is well with put that last verse up there if we could this morning but lord is for thee for thy comey [Music] the voice of the [Music] it is well this morning it is with my soul it is well it is well with my soul once again as brother brad comes oh it is well with my soul it is [Music] with my soul amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning is everything well amen amen happy to be a christian one or two anyway happy to be a christian this morning amen amen that's good god's certainly been good to us and been another hot week but uh we've we've persevered and endured and and now we've come to receive and what god has in store for us on this sunday that we could come and worship and fellowship around the word and and i hope you've come with expectations to receive um if you've just come because it's sunday morning and it's a routine and it's a habit well i i fear that you'll probably leave just as you did last week as a routine but if you come and say lord what do you have for me today and what can what can i receive from you what can i what can i get from you that i can draw closer to you this morning you'll get something from god just turn in your bibles if you would to the book of exodus i'm going to read from a couple of places i want to first go to exodus 14. i'll also be reading out of ecclesiastes [Applause] chapter 3. so i'm going to read verses 21 and 22 out of exodus 14 21-22 and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left it's an amazing scene there quite quite an amazing scene what god can do when he's when he's called on the scene let's turn in ecclesiastes if we could chapter three if you got your scofield bible that's uh on page 698 is where you'll find that and looking at this here in in this portion of scripture here um the author as we know is unknown they say in in this book but most make reference to solomon and he's telling us that there is an appointed time there's an appointed season for everything in our life there's a time for every activity there's a time for every event good or bad everything that happens to us everywhere we go every trial we go through every happy moment every sad moment and it tells us it has a purpose and everything that on this earth has an appointed time and all happens in such an orderly manner and sometimes we may not understand what we're going through we may not understand the things that's happening but i want you to know this morning that god is fully aware god is fully uh knowledgeable of what we're going through and he knows exactly how to step on the scene and he knows exactly when to step on the scene he says uh god is the alpha and the omega so he's the beginning and the end and in the beginning of the book it says in the beginning and at the end of the book it says the grace in revelations the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen so he's ending it there so from a human standpoint before we get into scripture but from a human standpoint there's a beginning and an end but god is eternal and that's the good thing about god is he doesn't look at time the way we look at time so read with me here in ecclesiastes 3. to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plan a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn a time to dance a time to cast away stones a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rend a time to sow a time to keep silent a time to speak a time to love a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace what prophet hath he that worketh in that word wherein he laboreth i have seen the travail which god has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end so this morning if we could on god's perfect time let us pray heavenly father we come before you this morning with expectations and with hearts lord that's hungering to for the word uh that would get us through the situations we go through on a day-to-day basis lord we know we're living in a trying hour a trying time but lord we know that you're more than able to see it through each situation that we have to go through father and we know that you have a time you have a place you have a an appointed set time that you come and meet us in situations that that we don't understand sometimes or situations that we go through we know that you come on the scene at just the right time and we want to look at a few of those things this morning lord lord we just ask that you would step into the vessel this morning as i'm just an empty vessel with broken notes but lord you know each and every need of the people sitting here this morning lord and we just ask that you administer to those needs whether it be uh encouragement whether it's needs of healing whether it's needs of uh just a closer walk with you or whether it's the to restore the joy of our salvation whatever the need would be this morning lord we just ask that you would move on the scene we just want to say we love you we appreciate you and thank you for all you do for us in jesus name amen so you can have your seats so as we read these scriptures we look at these scriptures and we learn that these seasons have been divinely placed within our lives by god almighty and we can clearly identify with this description of our life and and we see in life we move from birth to childhood to adolescence to adulthood to old age and finally to death and brothers and sisters through this whole walk of life god is fully in control god places certain people in your life god places certain jobs in your life he'll send you down a certain path for a career in your life he'll allow certain obstacles in your life he'll also allow certain victories in your life think about it god allows you to love someone but then he also allows you to suffer the loss of a loved one and god knows one thing i know that god knows is the end from the beginning there's no surprises to god we listen to what the prophet said here and he says god know the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything he could plan everything that it would work out just to his glory to his glory our life here is not to bring any glory to us it's not to lift us up on a pedestal it's not to give you the greatest career but this life here on earth is so that god can be used to show his glory and he says and that'll give us courage to know that no matter what comes or goes god is making everything listen now the clock is ticking just exactly on time you know i i like watches and you know what watchmakers and clockmakers they all strive to have the perfect watch that keeps perfect time and they'll go to great measures to try to enhance the internal parts of these watches and and to make them click just perfect so that they never lose time and they want it to be so so precise and i look at my watch this is the watch that i wanted for years i i i just had a desire for this watch for years and years and years and finally i got this watch and what i liked about this watch my parents gave it to me as a gift one year for christmas and i cherish this watch but what i like about it is it's a it's a citizen's echo drive atomic watch and so what that means is this watch right here it it senses atomic time in 26 world cities and has radio controlled accuracy in five zones it never needs a battery it runs off sunlight so every every time when the time changes this watch sends a signal to colorado and it resets itself i've never had to set this clock for daylight savings time i've never had to turn it back move it forward i've never had to put a battery in it and it's just that precise and as human beings we live in such a fast-paced world this time is important to us because we have appointments we have deadlines we have schedules we have meetings and if we miss something it just messes up our whole day don't it it can ruin your day and it just sets you into atonement man i missed it and i didn't make it here i didn't make it there my wife she she missed an appointment it was western's part of his graduation deal it was something simple something easy she missed it it ruined her day i mean ruined tears squall and bawling and west is like it wasn't a big deal but to her it was a big deal it was an appointment so brothers and sisters god sees our whole life from the womb to the tomb and he is aware of what we're going through and he's orchestrating it all so listen to what he says he says sometimes we get weary we get upset we get hastily we think oh i must do this and i must do that he said but remember god's clock will be exactly on time he said these things are to be that way is to be done according to his knowledge his great knowledge his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he could predestinate we try to place people here and there and put in and take out and we try to make the rules we don't make the rules we have to follow the rules god does the rule making he says it's god doesn't predestinate by his desire he's not willing that any should perish but by his foreknowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not and listen what he says he says therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning so you mean to tell me millions of people around the world and god is orchestrating every minute every second of every day we serve almighty god we serve almighty god and he's never late to a single appointment he's never late to any event any tragedy you go through any hardship you go through any challenge you're going through god is right there beside you along the way every step of the way now you say well i don't see him i don't feel him but let me tell you he's there and he's orchestrating he's making your situation happen there's a story i read about an old dog and this old dog fell into a dry well and you may have heard this story it's been around for a while and then a farmer come by and he looked and he seen the dog and heard the doggy up and down in the hole there in the you know in the whale wanting to get out and the old farmer looked and he's like man i don't know what i'm gonna do i guess i'm just gonna have to fill this thing in and just bury the dog alive so he goes and he gets him a wagon full of dirt and he pulls up to the well and he takes a shovelful and he throws it down into the hole of the well the dirt falls on top of the dog makes the dog mad the dog shakes the dirt falls off onto the floor dog runs in a circle he throws another shovel in the dog shakes the dirt falls off in the floor and he continues to do this over and over and over for over an hour and before you know it because the dog is in this situation this dire situation and it doesn't look like there's any way to get out slowly the ground is building up beneath him where he's shaking the dirt off and before you know it he jumps out of the well licks the farmer in the face and is so thankful that he sees his farmer and this owner again and brother says that's the way it is our life we don't understand sometimes how to get out of the well of a situation we're in but god will begin to find a way god will make a way and a purpose to get us through to get us out of the hole and sometimes we find ourselves in see sometimes life gives us crushing blows yeah crushing blows after blow after blow the song we sing brother russell's saying that's a crushing blow a crushing blow how do you overcome that he overcome because god was standing beside him all along the way and you say what was the purpose we sang a song that was 150 years old today because it placed a purpose in our hearts to tell us that no matter what we go through in life it is well amen time and time again through deep suffering the bible can find reasons to show us pain and suffering that people went through in their life sometimes we suffer because of the nature of sin we find ourselves a sinful living sometimes in the suffering begins to come on and and it builds up and you find yourself suffering sometimes we suffer just for the fact that god is wanting to prove who he is you ever realize that we suffer because god is trying to show his character through us and maybe god is showcasing us to satan like he did job did you think about that and i thought about this it's been on my mind all week to to speak on this and i thought to myself man why am i why lord are you directing me to go this direction because it seems like everything is smooth right now it seems like the testimony started out on wednesday was phenomenal people's been coming through stuff people's giving glory and honor and praising god for the good things but let me tell you it's always right around the corner you never know what is right around the corner no doubt job here he felt all alone and desperate for some kind of relief and it's normal for us when we go through things in life that we feel desperate that we feel alone that we feel like we're suffering and we feel isolated but we have to be able to remember that god never leaves us and god never forsakes us have you ever found yourself in a desperate situation hands should be up all building we've all been there we've had times that we wonder how am i going to get out of this what am i going to do my back's against the wall there's no way out i've been painted into a corner and i can't go we've been there rocking a hard place maybe it was financial troubles financial problems maybe it was family problems maybe it was your health it goes over and over things happen maybe your faith is faltering maybe you just don't didn't have that fire for god like you once had maybe you find yourself that your hope has kind of halted away that you don't even know there's no hope for tomorrow maybe you're sitting there and your victory's vanished you know it's a sad feeling when you lose your vic when you lose your victory you're almost in a defeated state of mind but brothers and sisters is in that time right there when god steps onto the scene because god's timing is perfect it may not feel like it it may feel like the pressure is mounting you may be suffering family problems your kids maybe they're going every direction you're wondering why are they going this way what what did i do god what did i do to send my children away from the word of god it may be that you have nothing to do with it at all but god may be trying to mold character into them because god's timing we can't understand when you heard the testimonies how did brother glenn come in contact with brother sean at a specific time a specific place a specific event there was a specific conversation that took place that drew them to wonder and want to know what's going on at evening like tabernacle what was it that got a fire started in brother tommy hardship was hardship wasn't it brother tommy it was painful it hurt but god put him in a situation that he can now be a witness that he can now be a living testimony and a witness and show what god is capable of doing and if we think about our thoughts it goes on and on and on that we can get our victory back we don't have to be without it but when we get our back against the wall that's when we have to call on jesus when our backs against the wall is when we have to depend on jesus you look here in exodus 14 what we were talking about the children of israel they find themselves in a desperate situation they're trapped nowhere to turn see the picture in your mind trapped with nowhere to go no way out they're caught between pharaoh and this deep red sea and the prophet said i can see them come up to that red sea listen he said god had his map drawn out you think man moses made a wrong turn moses wasn't following what god wanted to do or he would let him a different direction no no no no the problem is that god had his map drawed out he said and he was going to take him there and he moved them right up to the red sea no way at all they could cross it and he said here was pharaoh's army and the mountains they wrote armies behind them and the mountains on each side of them and the red sea in front of them you ever been there you ever been there when you look all around you the world is closing in on you can you imagine the children of israel as they look behind them and see the the dusty billows of chariots after chariot after chariot coming to take their head off and he said god looked down he said and he's seeing a pathway through the bottom of the sea he said there was his children right there needing the promise taking god at his word brother sisters god will show up on time don't think about your time don't think about your situation don't think about the diagnosis don't think about the prognosis don't think about the way the situation is getting out of hand think about god on time he said god looked down through that pillar of fire with angered eyes that's what our god does when he sees satan picking on you when he sees satan trying to get you in a situation that you can't get out of god looks down through the pillar of fire with angered eyes and he said he looked through those angered eyes and the sea became scared that's my god that's your god when something's on your back god looks down through the pillar fire with angered eyes and says part your way satan my child's coming through i can assure you there be times in your life you're going to see that red sea you're going to be at a red sea crossing and moses and his and god's people arrived at the shore of the red sea the egyptians all coming behind them what happened if we look back into the scripture here and we read it says they want to go back to the past why moses we tried to tell you when we were in egypt we tried to tell you we were we were okay there we were content we didn't ask for none of this moses if you're honest in your heart you're a christian you've been a christian for very long maybe as a young christian you get in a situation and you want to question god god i didn't i didn't ask for this i didn't sign up for this when i said i do at the altar i didn't ask for this hardship i didn't ask for my family to be torn apart i didn't ask for financial woes health issues death in the family i didn't ask for this and here they come up to this point and they say why did you bring us here what was it looking back to the past and moaning and groaning moses and says we told you in egypt this is what was going to happen this is what was going to happen and you know sometimes it's easier to fight under the temptation to want to go back to egypt you know i speak honestly to you always do i'll tell you honestly what what i'm feeling but sometimes it's easier in our minds to think i'll just go back to egypt i'll go back to the way i was in the world it was easy it was simple no problems do you think devil the devil's going to chase you he's got you no pharaoh's not coming after you if you're already building up building his temples pharaoh's not coming after you if you're already building his shrines and the sphinx and the pyramids and you're giving your day day after day after day laboring for satan pharaoh's not coming after you because he's already got you the world is not worth what it's made out to be the life was better for the children of israel once they got out of egypt was it instantaneous no were there more hardships was there hunger were there thirsting over and over and over trial after trial they began to get into but the problem was they were accustomed to slavery and if we're not careful we find ourselves accustomed to the slavery we was in ourselves you know if you're serving satan you're a slave if you're doing the things that satan has got you bound down to you've got task masters over you you've got someone telling you what to do when to do it and you're just like a little puppy yes sir yes sir yes sir [Music] why do people want to go back to that lifestyle why do people want to go back under the bondage of of drinking and carousing and drugs and alcohol why do they want that a filth pornography broken homes broken marriages why do they want to go back to that accustom to slavery comfortable with slavery sometimes we have a tendency to look back at egypt instead of seeing through holy ghost-filled eyes of where god is trying to get us to you know the prophet said it over and over and over nobody ever said this is gonna be a flowery bit of ease nobody ever says once you give your life to god man now you're in cruise control if they told you that they lied to you because that's not the case it's hard it's a challenge it's a daily devotion but it's something that god has called his people to overcome it's something that god has placed in you to overcome these things it's funny how we concentrate on the way things used to be you know memories are good to in a certain extent but but when we fail to look at where god's trying to get us to our memories became a weight around our ankles i think i'm going to go to church today but oh there's a there's a there's a game i want to go to and then you've got this ball and chain stuck behind you you know man there's some meetings going on i want to go to those meetings and i want to go see these people but oh ah i've got to be over here because my heart's telling me i want to do this i want to do that you can put whatever your challenge is in that sentence people just have a hard time overcoming but i don't understand why because the lord has constantly proven himself to us he's constantly taking us through dangers seen and unseen you know many times things happen and you don't understand why maybe there was a roadblock or something held you up 15 minutes just to get an hour down the road and find out that there was a 10 car pile up i don't even think i told you it's about this i told her about what i saw but i didn't tell her what a what really happened i don't think i was going from hopkinsville to clarksville on 24 and i was in a blazing hurry too many things to do too many things going on driving down the interstate something was holding me up in hopkins we all couldn't get around this car these two cars were side by side don't that aggravate you they won't let you around and finally i got around them maybe two miles down the road no more than 10 seconds in front of me car swiped over in front of another car parts start flying everywhere a hose flies off of a gas truck i'm talking with those big metal eight eight inch pipes that they fill up the service tanks with the stuff debris is flying everywhere if i would have just made it around those cars you know who that would have probably been it would have probably been me in a crumpled up mess it happened so fast i was part in the debris and made it around two or three more seconds is all it would have took but god says it's not time for that god says i'm mindful of you i'm mindful of your day i'm mindful of your job i'm mindful of where you're going to be when you're going to be there so just let me be in control and when i'm holding you up just be patient god brought the children of israel out of bondage and you know he brought us out of bondage because we easily tie everything back to history but you were in a bondage of sin we were in a bondage of unbelief and there was a cross called calvary where jesus christ went up on that he said i'm going to release every one of these people who will believe on me john 3 16. i'm going to release every one of them out of slavery every one of them out of bondage every one of them can just live freely in me and serve me but then we look back to egypt god says in romans the word says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of god so how do we let go of the past how many can honestly say as we pause here for a minute that sometimes the past plagues you it haunts you it can draw at you how do we get rid of that how do we overcome the past we begin to look through faith faith will lead us into places we've never dreamed possible the bible tells us don't be afraid don't fear don't allow the enemies to keep you in fear for fear is not of the lord in fact it's just the opposite it's the opposite of faith what is faith faith is believing faith is knowing the unseen is a reality so what is fear fear is nothing but false evidence appearing real f-e-a-r false evidence appearing real and it's a trick that the enemy has used for thousands of years to trick our minds it's a trick that he uses to get in there to entangle and trap us in a snare because it's a mind thing it's a mind thing that when the devil tells you you can't overcome you can't have a good job you can't have a good career you can't have a happy home a good family a happy marriage you'll never get married nobody will have you it's quiet you've heard some of that too huh you mean you're you're you're you've heard it too because i've heard some of those things in my life the god that satan tells me you have to have fear because you'll never be what god wants you to be god has not given us a spirit of fear but a power what else does it say of love and of a sound mind so no matter what the devil tries to plant in this device his device of fear and your spirit stand boldly on god's promise stand boldly on god's word and look to your faith because the children of israel they didn't believe that god would bring them out they were just going through the motions they were just living the day hey moses said pack your bags okay where are we going but over and over and over god tried to prove to them who he was in spite of all the plagues that they'd cast upon the egyptians they didn't believe they that god could see them through in spite of what god done for them they didn't think they could see him through going through emotions fear has to be dealt with so what did moses say when moses recognized this when moses recognized this he you look at our bibles here moses recognized this and the first thing he looks at he says unto the people fear not and stand still fear not and stand still because many times we find ourselves getting in a hurry and we run to and fro and here and there and we we're going nowhere so fast and god is saying stand still and and so you ever notice when you get into a situation sometimes maybe it's a get myself in trouble maybe it's your better half i'll i'll put it that way maybe it's a better half you're in a situation and she says you got to do something hurry up you got to do something don't just stand there do something but let me ask you why would we run around if we don't know where we're going because a lot of times that just makes the situation worse because then you begin to get frantic and you begin to panic and you begin to get the anxiety built up and this just begins at that vicious cycle of a downward spiral that this event is now getting worse than what it ever was don't let me tell you this don't just do something just stand there about what i said don't just do something stand there they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings of the eagles they shall run and not be worried they shall walk and not faint so with waiting comes a renewing of our faith with waiting becomes a renewing of our strength with waiting we becomes a renewing of our zeal and our love and our joy and our passion with waiting god can show you what to do listen to this prophet's talking about jesus and after he just taken five little fishes and two biscuits and feather five thousand and he was hungering and he was looking for something to eat and you know the story he goes on and he gets out there on the boat that night and he said it was pitched around like a little bottle stopper on the sea now listen to what he says there were ten thousand devils of the sea that swore they would drown him did you hear what i said ten thousand devils of the sea that swore they would drown them and you say well that was god they can't drown him that was jesus listen him out there asleep was so weak how many has ever felt weak you felt weak as a christian many times we all get there he was weak virtue had went out of him he was tired from healing and going on about that day until the devil said oh we got him out here asleep now we're gonna drown him here's the part that me and you you and i can relate to he said he was a man when he was laying there down there on that boat asleep tired weary worn frazzled from the day's events hungry he said but when he walked out there and he put his foot up on the bow that ship i'll be out there with you he said when he put his foot up there on the bow that on the braille that boat and he said what peace be still do you see how the whole situation changed he went from a man that was tired and we fury and worn and didn't know if he could make it and the dev ten thousand devils from the sea was fixing to drown and when he walked peace be still the whole situation changed he said the winds and waves obey him because he was more than a man he was more than a man it was god speaking through mortal lips of his son hallelujah listen now and listen how close he says and when christ was then and what christ was then we have positionally the same powers today [Applause] listen now he says granted in jesus christ where is the faith of the church we have the same powers today no matter what storm you're in no matter if the sea is tempest no matter if it's up and down and you feel like you're fixing to be spilt out on the ground or into the water jesus christ says that same power that i had you have that's a mighty god we serve when we look to our faith and we begin to depend on the lord and we trust him to look to our faith he begins to strengthen our hearts mind when you're standing still he begins to strengthen your will he begins to strengthen your emotion because we're standing still and we're trusting in god's word stand still and see the salvation of the lord when we're able to stand still and let god do what he does best watch god move on your behalf why because he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you and it's for a purpose we don't understand many times why we're at the red sea and i thought about this red sea experience because you know most of the people there they weren't even believers we've talked about that before they were doubters so what was the purpose of this red sea because god has a plan he had a blueprint he said my children have got to get over here into the promised land somehow because somewhere in the midst of these people there is a seed laying there that is going to be my children in the promised land so somebody had to see this event happen can you imagine maybe it was joshua and caleb maybe they had to see that so that they knew that when we come around the corner we're more than able to take the city it's always leading up to one event so in our life things happen one time something else happens and it encourages you and it builds you and you see a testimony and you see a healing and you see this next thing you know you're the one getting healed because you've seen god in action so no matter what comes our way the crossing of the red sea is for a purpose it may be it's for your faith to be stronger maybe it's so that your songs can be louder maybe so that you're frequent there's a purpose sometimes we look and we we've got all kinds of excuses all kinds of them they come out of everywhere satan is the biggest excuse giver we'll say it's impossible god says all things are possible this is scriptures i'm fixing to give you i'm too tired god says i'll give you rest nobody loves me how many have we ever felt that way nobody loves me i go to church every sunday nobody ever say a word i mean nobody in that place loves me i'm just a misfit would god say i love you i can't go on and god says my grace is sufficient i cannot do it you can do all things i'm unable god says i'm able i'm not worth it god says it'll be worth it you see how this just goes on i cannot forgive myself i forgive you i forgive you i may not be able to forgive myself for things i've done in my past and you may not be able to forgive yours for things you've done in your past people around me may not be able to forgive me for things i've done in life but one person can when he says you're forgiven it's not only forgiven it's forgotten so it no longer hangs over your head you're forgiven and you say well i i can't afford to do it and that's an easy one there hard times we're in hard times right diesel we're in hard times i don't i can't afford to do it what did god say i will supply some of no all of your needs when you need it it'll be there [Music] no doubt job job looking back at job here for a minute no doubt job felt isolated felt isolated and far away from god but job held steadfastly to god's word even though he felt abandoned even though he knew that god was in control somebody mentioned job in the song service i couldn't hear it all but i knew i knew job was in my notes but i was thinking about job here and you know he lost his children he lost his wealth he lost his friends he lost everything he had in life but his wife the one who said just curse god and die isn't that one of the most astounding statements made in the old testament just curse god and die job she didn't she look at him say job you know god has been so good to you god has given you and blessed you and multiplied uh your your fields and multiplied your your cattle and he's given you great kids and no just curse him just curse him and die how would you like to be yoked with that one that wouldn't sound like too too much of a fun marriage but in book there we read and job says but he knows the way that i take and when he has tried me i shall come out as gold his wife says curse him and die and he says no once i have been through the the harshest of trials once i've been through the test of my life once i feel like i can't go no more that's when i'll be tried as gold brothers and sisters i want to be as gold in the sight of god he knew that when the trials were over he would emerge from those trials stronger and and and brighter and more passionate about god time is about to get away from us it if you want to follow along with me we'll we'll turn to john 11. i'm just going to kind of rehearse this as we try to find a place to slow down here john chapter 11. we talk about god being an all-time god here was a man named lazarus and he was sick and lazarus had been laying there sick and his sister and mary and martha martha and mary i should say they cared so much about lazarus and as you read through these scriptures you know the prophet said that jesus was lazarus buddy that's a special kind of a tag right there lazarus and jesus were buddies it was more than just a name in the book it was more than just an acquaintance over in bethany it was more than that but mary martha and lazarus they were all close-knit and tight with jesus mary is the one that says in the bible that washed jesus's feet and dried it with her hair that's a special kind of connection with this man and here he is he's sick and they send word to jesus saying he who thou lovest is sick and when jesus heard it he said a sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby and then it begins to go on to tell more how jesus loved these three people so so closely and it says when he had heard therefore that he was sick he rushed back to bethany to go save him no it said he abode for two more days this is his best friend this is his buddy these are two of the women that are that are close to jesus than anybody any other any two women we know in the bible and they're begging him come back and and help lazarus your friend he's sick come back and help him i've got work to i'll be i got two days worth of work but then after that's done they said uh after that he tells his disciples why after we've been working for two days why don't we go on over into judea so see time was not a concern to jesus about lazarus being sick now to mary and martha and lazarus it was a different story put yourself in that situation when it's your loved one laying there sick and in pain and hurting you want to see jesus right there right now and on the scene when it's you that has a dire situation a dire need and you're praying you want to see him right there on the scene but then he says i'm going over here to tend to this person first and lazarus is laying there and he he's getting worse and worse and worse by the day and jesus is saying i want to go back over here and his disciples are saying no no no lord we don't need to do that those people are wanting to stone you to death what about lazarus your friend what about our friend he sleepeth and and maybe we need to go see it and tend to him and the disciples look at the lord says if he shall do well the disciples are saying that to jesus if he's just asleep he'll be fine he's going to be all right if he's just sleeping and jesus just says no boys listen here let me speak plain to you lazarus is dead isn't it something hell nobody had to tell him that they sent word to him that he was sick but you never see in the scripture anywhere where the word was sent back and said it's too late he's gone but it says jesus spoke plainly to him i said listen guys lazarus is dead and he said i'm glad for your sake that i was not there because let me tell you what i'm going to do here for your sake and for the intent that you might believe i'm going to show you something you've never seen before in a roundabout way god is speaking to his disciples and telling them that and he says when jesus comes into the back into bethany he finds lazarus and he's been there in the grave for four days already the prophet said it said in his nose had sunk in skin worms were crawling out of him the stitch was probably at that time martha runs out when she sees jesus and she says lord if thou hast been here my brother would not have died i love the humility of martha here you know she could right there and said man we sent word to you we told you you had to come or he was going to die where have you been no see how she approached god with tenderness and concern and said lord if only you'd have been here lazarus would not have died and he says unto her jesus says my brother shall live again and what's martha say i know he'll he'll rise again in the resurrection martha who am i who am i i'm not four days late i'm right on time i am the resurrection and whatever i say will happen and whenever i say it it'll take place and that he that believeth in me as though he were dead he shall live again so this situation picture it now it's getting a little bit a little bit sticky jesus is explaining all this to martha and then all of a sudden mary hears about it and she comes out there and she comes out there and she wants to know the same thing if you would have just been jesus if you would have just been here and then mary breaks down and break down and cry and weep and moaning to jesus over the laws of lazarus and jesus wants to know where have you laid him and jesus begins to feel he begins to hurt jesus begins to have anguish and pain and it brings us to those two famous words jesus wept the prophet said when he wept he was weeping like a man it hurt like a man who had lost his best friend he hurt like a man who was watching the family grieve and moan oh and groan over the laws of their dear brother and jesus says was groaning in himself coming to the grave and he said take away the stone can you imagine the scenario the scene playing out before him martha mary said and martha begins to look and says jesus i don't know that this is a good idea he's he's been dead for four days he stinks let's don't let's don't embarrass our family like that and this has to be going through her mind and jesus says take the stone away and they took the stone from where he was dead and he looked at him and as he looked at him he cried out with a loud voice lazarus come forth brothers and sisters that is an on time god that is a god right there that has perfect time he didn't care that he was dead for four days he knew he had life and that life he had was to give and if there's anybody sitting here this morning that you find yourself dead in sin and unbelief i want you to know that jesus has a life to give to you and that life is abundant this morning [Music] the prophet began to tell the story about daniel he began to tell the story about daniel and he says i'll not defile myself to this king's world standing true to god he said he come right down to the end of the road it seemed like the end of his time had come they throwed him into the lion's den and what happened god's on the scene god stepped on the scene and one morning he said in babylon i love this story he said way down in babylon he said i can look up to heaven i can see a throne of angels standing around and he said i looked down here in babylon and i can see a burning furnace he said and i can see the children standing there saying oh god is able to deliver us and they can feel the heat bowling off of this furnace and these three boys these three hebrew boys are sitting in there and their only thought is i know that god is able to deliver us my god can be on time and he said we're not bowing to your image we're going to stand right here you notice they had to take a stand they didn't run they didn't try to evade the guards they didn't they didn't try to go here and go there and make this right and make that no they stood the ground and said we're going to stand right here and we won't bow to your god all right said the king walk up those steps you're going to get burned and he said a great big husky man on with a with a spear come up there and push them to the steps and it got hotter and hotter and hotter and in our minds as we read this story and we rehearse the story we think oh my goodness these three boys are doomed but god the prophet says he said i can see an angel standing over one side of the throne and he grabbed the sword and pulled it out see the unseen is what baffles me the unseen it just it just it just encourages my heart so much to know what god cares so much that he's watching our every move every step we every move we take god is sitting there watching and the angels are trying to look and fix things and he said this angel that grabbed his sword and pulled it out and said father look down there what's going on let me go i'm gabriel he knew who he was and i can change the scene he said put your sword back in the sheath gabriel i've watched it do you notice god didn't say gave me a hurry run you got to get down there it's an emergency those boys are fixing to burn up put your sword up gabriel relax i'm watching this i got it all under control he said here comes up another one father i'm wormwood i'm the destroyer with water in the andaluvian time man sinned and mistreated your people and i turned the whole world into a globe of water i can wash babylon off the map this morning you think wormwood didn't have the power to put out a fire he covered the whole globe with water i know you could wormwood you're a faithful angel but i can't let you go this is my job come on church god said i can't let you go down there this is my job these are my children these are my people i'm going down there i've watched them all night i've heard their prayer i've seen them stand for my word and i'll be their own time he said my oh my i could see him raise up and his kingly garments fall around him and say come here east wind come here north wind south wind and west wind step over there under that thunder head you wonder and i'm going to ride you as a chariot in the morning and go down to babylon and i'm going to change the scene he said an old brother he was right there on time he's an on-time god sister becky musicians if you would come no matter what we go through in life no matter the challenges we face no matter the hardships no matter the stress don't let fear take you don't let your past grab a hold of you live by faith trust in
