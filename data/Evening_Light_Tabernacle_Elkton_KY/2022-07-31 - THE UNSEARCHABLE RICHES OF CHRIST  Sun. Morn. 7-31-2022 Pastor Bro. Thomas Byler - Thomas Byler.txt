TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning brothers and sisters we just all stand this morning maybe brother uh john hershberger will open us in prayer this morning and uh the children can be dismissed for sunday school and if we'll go in the psalms here to psalms 124 just the little psalms psalms 124 if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say and they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us then the proud waters had gone over our soul our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth god bless you may be seated brother brian morning brothers and sisters it was a long day on the concrete yesterday if you turned me to jonah in the fourth chapter i was as we were reading that psalm and i was thinking over there thought came to my mind you know as a christian any situations going to make you react a certain way and how you react lets you know really what you are on the inside you know you can't hide from yourself when things go bad or or whatever the situation's affecting you your first reaction is you can't hide that that's exactly who you are and what you are that first reaction whether it's the line whether it's to steal something whether it's to walk away when you know you should help somebody that first reaction is who you really are and i was just thinking as christians this morning what's our first reaction to anything that happens to us this morning you know i was thinking if the world hates you as a christian what would your reaction be of course your mind will tell you that you need to love them more whoever that person is that's afflicting you or pressing you your reaction should not to be to become like him but to actually forgive him and love him and just care about him more or whatever this it should be the opposite of what the world would do to you this morning whatever that reaction you're gonna have and you know i'm not afraid you know i made a mistake yesterday myself i i got locked in a mechanical room yesterday and i'm trying to get out of it and no one's paying me any attention you know what just like i said you can lose total control you know and that nature comes out and my half mine just happens to be a bear or a dragon sometimes and i wasn't a very pleasant person after waiting a half hour for someone to unlock me out of that mechanical room so we had to tell on ourselves sometimes i wasn't the best person when i found out i was locked in but i was just thinking of jonah this morning and uh you know jonah is had a reaction too you know jonah was told to go to nineveh one of the worst cities in the world at that time a perverted city a polluted city not in a natural sense but in a in a spiritual sense and he was in israel and he was told to go and prophesy against him and then this is the last chapter and i was thinking as i was saying as you react to any given situation it's really who you are let me just read this chapter here you know and i didn't have anything to think i was just sitting there this morning kind of blank and then somehow my bible would there's nothing behind it but somehow my bible was open to this chapter and i'll just read it this morning and then i'm going to jump to another chapter in in the gospels but this is uh jonah the fourth chapter it says but it displeased jonah exceedingly that he was very angry and all you know why jonah was angry and if you don't know maybe you need to go and read these four chapters this week and he prayed unto the lord that i pray thee o lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art gracious god a merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentancy of evil so what jonah's thought was for the people of nineveh and what gods thought were totally opposite and goes back to what i was saying earlier that first reaction god's reaction was to love people and desire to see them accept forgiveness not to say that if they had not asked for forgiveness he still would have destroyed the city don't get me wrong they would have had to pay for a final judgment for their of not accepting the message but then i'll go on and read and he and i lost my place here therefore now oh lord take i beseech thee my life from me for it it's better for me to die than to live so he's pretty angry you know as a person he's seen god give mercy to someone and treat someone kindly that he thought that god should have destroyed and god should have killed and he's angry about it before the lord and you know sometimes we can be that way also therefore now oh lord take i beseech thee my life for me for it is better for me to die than to live and then said the lord does thou well to be angry so god is trying him taunting him and then jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow so he might see what would become of the city he already knew what was going to happen because they repented god was not going to destroy the city but he still had some hope there that god might change his mind and the lord god prepared a gourd and made it to come up over jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so jonah was exceedingly glad of the gourd but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and smoked the gourd that it withered and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared a venomous east wind and the sun beat upon beat up beat upon the head of jonah and he fainted and wished himself to die i said it's better for me to die than to live and god said to jonah dust thou well to be angry for the lord said i do well to be angry even unto death then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for thou which has not labored neither made it grow which made excuse me which made it to come up in the night in paris in the night should i have not spared nineveh the great city where more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between the right hand and the left hand and also much cattle scott's telling noah that these people didn't know any better they couldn't tell the difference between wrong and right and sometimes when we mingle out there with the people of this world you know sometimes we can get short with them but a lot of times the people that we deal with every day they haven't been taught they don't know no better they don't know their right hand from the left hand and our attitude and how we interact with them is a testimony to who jesus christ is because the only god or the only christ they're ever going to see is the one that's in your heart and in your life and how you deal with them as an individual will reflect on what jesus christ is to him and uh and i would like i said i'm not afraid to say that i wasn't a very good example yesterday uh if you return with me to matthew the 15th chapter you know some you know you can't whatever you're feeling you know whether i can only speak whether you're in great pain great distress doesn't give you the right to treat other people that way you know you you have to realize no matter what you're feeling and going through doesn't give you a right to treat other people bad and i was this is uh the 15th chapter of matthew you know i guess i'm talking to myself this morning and um i don't want to read this whole chapter i say that and i would go ahead and read all 39 verses but i'm not going to do that but uh this is i'll read then jesus scribes and services were jesus saying why did i you know he's talking about i think about the commandments of you know how to wash hearts and all this other stuff all these pharisees could see is what christ and what the disciples and their mind was doing wrong again not they thought their right hand and left hand were doing the right thing but actually it wasn't and then jesus talks to him again and he answered them and said unto them why do you also transgress the commandments of god by your trait he looks them right in the face and he tells them why are you transgressing the commandments with their trans traditions and god commands saying honor thy father and mother and he curses his father and mother let him die of the death but you say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift whatsoever thou mightest prophet of me and and he keeps on talking about and then i want to jump down to this about the 16th jesus he's talking to his own disciples and he says about the thing he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted uh let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind if the blind lead the blind they both should fall into the ditch and sometimes you have to treat their people they're fighting you a lot that's mean you don't love them or care for them but if they're just wanting to be contentious with you all the time sometimes it's not good to argue with him you just got to learn to live leave him alone sometimes then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable and jesus said are you not without understanding you know a lot of times we're all hard-headed like peter was sometimes it's sometimes we got to get beat down several times before we really understand what god's trying to tell us do you not understand whatsoever energetic the mouth goes and he's talking about how they were the things that they were doing the pots washing washing the hands he goes on to say do you not understand what's there enter into the mouth go with to the belly and it's cast out into the drought but the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile them and that's what i've been talking about the last few minutes it's that reaction how you treat people how you treat your family how you treat a stranger on the street how you treat them coming out of your heart coming out of life that's who you really are and like i said you can't hide from yourself you know what you are but these things which proceed out of the mouth come from the fat of the heart they defile the man for out of the heart perceive evil thoughts murders adulteries fornication thefts false witness and blasphemy these are the things which defile a man but to eat without washing hands and defiles not a man and i was just thinking i'll finish with this one thought this morning not wanting to let take a lot of time but you got to realize or i have to realize sometimes you don't know who's really watching you who's watching your life who's watching how you react to situations as they're presented to you that reaction that you have that's when someone's watching you might be the reaction that makes them walk away forever so everything we do in life we got to be careful what we say what we believe and how we treat people brother david if we could and just appreciate the sunday school this morning i'm just never amazed ever amazed at what god does i had some thoughts running through my mind and then brother brian he begins to get onto me for how i react sometimes with things and i said well lord you know what we have need of in our hearts and lives and amen and you know we've been told all of our life that we're the only jesus that some people ever see the only bible they'll ever read and just say lord help us to be what we need to be this morning is that your heart's desire and amen just love him with all of our heart this morning it's just good to have each and everyone out it's good to have brother thomas and sister donna back feeling better and the different ones has been sick sister hannah and them we just appreciate them being here this morning and being feeling better and just pray that god will come speak to our hearts and and man just love him this morning and amen let's just sing that little course so glad i'm yours lord as we open the service this morning amen i mean he's glad you're his this morning oh so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours so glad your mercy has followed me [Music]

can imagine that how many knows that just beyond this this last breath our prophet took us over there he's seen it he was over there and god showed him all the saints of all uh this age it was passed on already and so forth and how they were and he says there's no words in the english vocabulary to describe how beautiful it is over there amen aren't you glad that god came in this generation and proved to show that he was alive god is alive and well how many knows that he's the same yesterday today and forever he don't never change we might change but god don't never change amen and so we're

the uh the uh board is praying about we have been made an offer for some of this field back here uh made an offer on the field part of your church property so i told the board to pray about it and see if they feel like maybe it would be something to bring before the church and let you all vote on whether we want to sell about five six acres of that real rocky rough field that i've mowed many times and know that it's not a whole lot of fields as far as i'm concerned and and if we could get quite a bit of money out of it maybe at this time since everything's high and so forth and and if uh you

which in other ages was not made known unto men but is now revealed unto his holy prophets apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs amen we want to talk a little bit about being heir of god amen and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i was made a minister or according to the gift of grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than this less than the least less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men to see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden god who created all things by christ jesus may god had his blessings to reading of the word you can be seated amen maybe that will have you have you standing long enough to be able to endure for a while amen praise the lord hallelujah oh my you know i'm i just get to thinking and i've been speaking of course here the last i think the sermon i one of the last sermons that i was ministering on was keeping a positive attitude in the midst of so much negativity isn't that right i mean notice there's everything about this world is negative there's nothing positive about it at all amen amen but in the midst of all of that negativity paul could always stay positive amen you know he said this way just to mention a little bit of recap he says who shall who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter now that that that picture right there that scripture right there would certainly look like we are it's a hopeless case that we're considered as sheep to the slaughter they kill us just however they want to so to speak because they certainly did in the dark ages they killed christians by the millions isn't that right and so forth we are kian as sheep as the slaughter and then he changes his mind and his tune kind of he says no or nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us it's not just a sad story but we're conquerors and not just conquerors but more than conquerors through him that loved us amen praise the lord for i am persuaded he says that not death not life nor angels nor principalities nor poor powers nor things present nor things to come not height not depth not any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of christ which is in christ jesus our lord praise be to god i you are looking at a witness that has been serving the lord since he was 20 years old i'm 69 i'm here to testify this morning that that is true not tribulation not distress not anguish knight is not a devil out of hell that can ever separate you from the love of god once you are born again when god does it work for you and in you it is for lights it's for eternity praise be to god hallelujah so and i got to thinking and i want to just first of all talk about the reason i read that scripture about paul here because he of course paul was not a rich man was at one time but then he said i have suffered the loss of all things for the glory of christ he barely had a coat to wear and that right i know how to abound and i know how to have nothing i know how to suffer need and so forth amen and i know how to have plenty of that then he makes the statement after that says i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me how many believes that a christian can go through good times he can go through bad times and he can go through either way it don't matter as long as he got christ in his life we're living in an age when folks we need we got on the scene more than we ever have we don't need a god of just history but we need a present i am god how many believe that the god that was with david the god that was the daniel and the the evil children the god that went through the fire in front of me that same god is here this morning i've never heard prophet say during this time that i've been a little bit sick he said something you know if you could just get it in your mind and in your heart that god is here now anything could happen you've got to believe it oh and and now god he's an on-time guard don't get me started well get me stuff praise be that god hallelujah thank you jesus amen god is good we need a god that is a god of this morning right now he told moses to go down to egypt and tell fear pharaoh to let my people go and so forth that what did he say he says go and if they ask who sends you what do you say tell them i am i am there's something special about those two words to me because when i'm sick i need i am god when i'm in trouble i need i am god the god that is right there right now and to think folks that you don't have to go through this world alone you don't have to be alone nobody likes to be alone and you may feel like you're all alone but let me tell you if you've got christ you've got everybody you've got everything that you have need of if you've got christ and so again coming back to our thought it's the unsearchable riches amen because as we go through life we see and we know that as we go through life we're going to get poorer and poorer that's quiet yeah you're going to get poorer and poorer less rich and less rich amen until finally it'll come down if we're still here at that time that you won't be able to buy ourselves amen you won't even buy or sell these now your money isn't going to mean anything our farms and our comfort knowledge it isn't going to mean anything after a while the devil is out to amen he's out to rob and to kill and to steal and destroy amen yet paul could talk about the unsearchable riches of christ and i want to talk about that with the help of the lord but first i want to go to saint john 10 and we begin with response verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber now i'm gonna jump down i'm going to show you what a thief and a robber does verse 8 jesus says all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers now if you'll notice in verse 1 it says that people that try to get to heaven try to find joy huh try to find peace try to find christ in in some other way or their own way hello they're thieves and robbers you can't come and find those things your way you've got to come through christ there's only one way to come and that is through christ amen all they were coming were thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door and by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and go in and out and find pasture see i know i got a lot of believers here this morning that know what that pasture is all about i figured i have a few more amens on that pasture thing amen that you can find pasture some people only get fed when they come to church on sunday or wednesday folks that's not that's not the idea no that's not the idea the idea is to feed constantly finding pasture all the time my i don't know if i should say what comes to my mind or not should i do i have your permission some people aren't even hungry anymore i don't go to church don't bother me huh i don't listen to tapes read my bible or go to church i'm just not hungry i don't i don't pastor it's a bad sign isn't it it's terrible but what do we come for we come into the house of god to feed on the word of god we call it a worship service hallelujah oh my yesterday i was sitting there thinking you know when we get to heaven hallelujah i believe we're going to have some more worship services don't you when we get over there we're going to get to get to go oh my what is that uh we'll get together we'll have a worship service and praise god amen only if i'm the preacher i won't have to preach anymore to sinners i mean those gods the sinner had refused to heed the call when we get together over there it's just the worship service day night morning evening oh man you can worship as long as you want you ain't got about worry about 12 30 coming up you got to worry about your job or anything else just follow jesus feet i imagine there's going to be a worship service going all the time over there and if you get tired of it over here i wonder if you'll even be over there because i don't want people to get tired of it huh doesn't get old over there 10 000 years but shining is this time we have no less days to sing god's praise than we first begun praise his lord so we see here he says the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy how many knows that's the world that we're living in any politicians any government that wants to try to give you this and promise you that they're not there to give you nothing they're there to kill you to kill you to steal from you and to destroy you that's all the devil is out to do is destroy he wants to destroy the families he wants to destroy our children he wants to destroy their identity he wants to get between husbands and wives and to separate him that's the devil's work destroy destroy destroy amen that's all he does destroy i shouldn't take you on my reminiscing trip but yesterday i was reminiscing i guess you call it about how that you know i was thinking is it really better to live in this age where we better be better off on the horses and the wagons head west taking our sledgehammers and driving some stakes on as much properties we want huh sure we would have died from uh this and the diet from the that because they can't take everything there a lot of people died but you know think about it we're the earlier days really better maybe than the latter days because where we're heading is a terrible place folks where we have come to in the rottenness the immorality has happened all around us it's barely a fit place to live anymore amen why because devils always describes like the prophet said he says you know you've got to dig down to find the kingdom of the egyptians and the romans and so forth he says that's the same way with america and the world it's all going to be a thing of the past i mean i was all gonna be a thing of the past folks i when i think about the prophet of god saying you know i highly doubt that the time will last as long as my my my natural life span would last he'd be about 105. he seriously didn't think it'd go that long and here we are past that place how many knows it's time to wake up it's time to be ready folks to meet the lord amen so we find out brothers and sisters that as we see our our our rights we see our privileges we see all of these different things being taken from us amen the devil robbing the devil stealing the devil destroying in the middle of all that we can still praise be to god i'm just glad for that it don't matter you know because eventually you know it doesn't matter how rich how rich you get here like i said a while ago we're going to get poorer because if time with terry what does the bible say you get to take with you for it is certain that we can take nothing with us as far as this world not no character in the spiritual realm but in the natural realm you'll carry nothing with you you'll go out empty-handed why do you think jesus told us labor not for the meat that perishes but labor for the meat that endures unto everlasting life work for that for this eternal [Music] praise be to god are you ready for the good news i got some good news for you this morning he comes for to kill and to destroy i am come thus saith the spirit i am come that you might have lights and that you might have it more abundantly he gives joy and he wants your joy to be full this morning not half full not a little full and let me tell you that's what gets the whole world and everybody out there in trouble because they seek joy they see comfort huh and they stick it in the wrong place and it'll destroy them i remember probably god made a statement the other day he says you know a people's comfort is their god what their comfort is in god whatever they to turn to for comfort that's their god and didn't jesus say i'll send you a comforter amen i'm aren't you there for that god said he's going to send us a comp order so that we can have some comfort in this world the real comfort that gives you peace gives you joy gives you happiness gives you soundness makes man a man make the woman a woman makes teenagers teenagers everybody in line full of joy the way it's supposed to be amen take a sinner like me that thought van halen and ac dc and all that smoking was joy and happiness huh i found out real quick that don't never satisfy neither rock and roll music that ain't gonna satisfy is it that there's only one thing that satisfies and it's when your cook cup gets filled when that void in there in your heart gets filled with god [Music] you were never meant to live through this life without god the world wasn't meant to be without god that's why he gave his son amen for the whole world so the whole world whosoever believeth in him should not perish i've come to give you life and that more abundantly come unto me oh you are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest wow that's nice it's nice being a christian heard brother bam say yesterday he said you know i believe that if i wasn't a christian i'd almost be a suicide case huh isn't it a wonder that there is so many suicide cases because they don't have a christ in their heart they have no hope amen people think they're rich and unto the angels will lay out the sins he writes because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have needed nothing and no it's not they're not that are wretched you're miserable you're poor you're blind and you're naked and no it's not notice they and no it's not the toward all of these things it's time to be rich in christ so in this world speaking all of your rights will be taken away you can't even buy ourselves without taking the mark of the beast huh i was listening yesterday and brother was talking about the mark of the beast of unbelief and when christ comes before you when the word is presented to you and you disbelieve that you either receive the baptism of the holy ghost right by you are sealed until the day of redemption you have the mark of god in your heart and in your head in that right you have the seal of god you take the seal of god or you take this mark of the beast through unbelief and i had to think look at all the people that's taken the mark of the beast look at all the people with the mark of the beast unbelievers that don't believe the word of god have taken the mark of the beast when they reject it to truth it's a tremendous thing you know the scary part i heard brother brown say he says you know you'll still go to church but wherever you turn down the truth you'll just keep going to church and i was like you'll keep going to church yeah keep going to church thinking you're all right but you turn down the truth now he won't never believe it again god help me never to disbelieve god when he speaks to my heart don't you believe the holy spirit when he speaks to your heart you say well that's just the preacher is it really huh now that's supposed to be god talking to you isn't that right praise the lord do you love one another are you glad to be a part of the family of god i'm so glad to be a part of the family of god now we want to go to um another scripture in galatians three we will talk about an heir an heir of god now we know that in this world a lot of parents a lot of people get a lot of riches and when they pass away where does all those things go to those things go to what they call an heir an heir that receives the inheritance right an inheritance amen and there's a lot of very rich people as i was coming to church i thought about trump and ivanka i guess it is and jared maybe and some of those children of his and you know the things they would inherit when their parents pass away and so forth you know isn't that right jesus inherits everything all power jesus when he come uh he came back and talked to disciples he says all power is given unto me in heaven and earth he's got a name that is with every name that is named and then paul says in chapter 3 of galatians verse 29 and if ye be christ then ye are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now i say that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from his servant though he be lord of all but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children and under the bondage of the elements of the world but when the fullness of time came god sent his forth his son made of a woman made it under the law to redeem them that are under the law that he might receive the adoption of sons and because he our sons god has sent forth his spirit the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father praise be to god aren't you glad to have a father i am so thankful to have a heavenly father amen now notice wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ another place the bible says where joy heirs with christ in other words we're joint heirs christ inherits everything and everything he hates you in hell also now we're starting to look at what paul was saying about the unsearchable riches of christ how many knows it is absolutely the greatest the most richest things are in god here it says that we're heirs of god one of the first things you'll notice and if you ever go to church you ever dedicate your life to god you ever have something down in your heart amen it causes you to want to turn from your ways amen say god forgive me of my sins i need you lord one thing that you have to believe and that is that you are a son of god you are god's child you're coming to him all that the father has given will come to me and i will keep losing none of them amen you've got to believe that your child and if you are a son when you are a son and you get born again it shows you that you are an heir of god y'all remember brother ben him in the back of that trailer and he had a little typewriter and he hadn't much know all it'll be the office hey man he was world knows brother bannon was but billy graham all roberts they had their multi-million dollar buildings and so forth and so forth he says lord look what they got and look at what i got and something in his heart kind of spoke to himself yeah but you got me i'm yours how many knows that i don't care if you got nothing if you've got god you got everything amen it's heirs of god what is god god is eternal life you and i are heirs to eternal life amen and everything that pertains to god so much so so much so that jesus said he that overcometh will sit with me in my throne amen even as i overcame and sat in my father's throne when you are a child of god you are an heir to the throne how many knows that when jesus sits on that throne and rules and reigns for a thousand years somebody's going to be with him a king has a queen a king has a queen we are his queen we're going to sit with him we're going to rule with him but before we ever do that we've got some overcoming to do don't we we've got some trials we gotta go through we gotta do some fighting that we gotta do like in joshua if you remember every place that the soul of your foot treads that's yours it belongs to you that's it with the word of god when you become born again when you get filled with the holy ghost every promise in the book is yours i don't know if it takes me two weeks next two weeks to go through them all but i want to go through some of them would that be all right we want to look at what's ours you don't even know we don't even realize what's ours and you can just take one little thing and be happy brother bam tells the story of let's say there's a hungry person that's dying of hunger he says dying of hunger there's a store store perhaps five miles down the road and this person just can maybe just barely make it that far just barely make it now ain't got no bread i ain't got no food with me but here's a quarter here's a quarter right it'll buy you a loaf of bread i'll tell you what i'm not gonna just give you a quarter but i'm gonna give you five dollars you can buy bread and you can fight that ball beef baloney and you can even get a hot dog if you'd like all right and you can go there you can get filled that guy i'll tell you what he's so hungry when you're so hungry you'll do anything just to get to that place let me tell you something if you have a need this morning it's important that you get to that place that can supply what you have need of and that's in quiet you got to get there you got it no matter what you gotta want it more than your own life mom dad but i more than anything that's what jesus said amen you got a desire with all your heart same as i did when i got the baptism in the whole i wanted above everything i don't care if you make a fool out of me i don't get what what do you want me to do i just i'm yours lord 100 that's what it takes not come to that place you're not quite ready yet amen that guy he takes that five dollar bill and there he's maybe and all of a sudden he gets happy he gets a jumping around [Applause] that man or that person can be just as happy with that five dollars as he can with all the food that he can buy he can be just as happy with it that's you and i that's you and i because we've got the earnest we've got the earnest money we've got what it takes amen then he also talks about it because it's what it's a paid price it's what pays the paying price amen over in ephesians let's go somewhere else first no let's not let's go just let's just go that way ephesians 1 and verse 13 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed amen how many know something has to happen because i know baptists and different ones say well if you believe you got it no paul said to the those in acts 19 and says have you received the holy ghost since you've believed huh here's says after you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise amen so you were sealed which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession hallelujah praise be to god the holy spirit is the down payment until god comes and takes you home that's what i'm reading here it's a down payment it's the earnest of your inheritance it's the earnest that if you get put in the grave you'll rise again it's the earnest that if you lay down and you are fixing to die there's somebody there to carry you over not only that but you'd see earnest anybody if you are in this world that you've got a heavenly father that cares about you and has promised to take care of you i'm just glad for inheriting a father we're adopted we were adopted into this and we inherited a father a father that cares about you let's talk about the father for just a minute would that be okay one of my favorite scriptures matthew 6 and verse 24 says no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon one thing we have learned and know that that is that there's only two powers in this universe one is the power of the devil one is the power of god how many knows that there's no there's no other you'll either serve the devil or you'll serve god no other you've got no other choice amen therefore he says jesus says now notice where jesus goes after telling everybody that you're going to either serve one or the other he says therefore take no thought for your life of what you shall eat or what you shall drink or know yet for your body what show you shoop it on it's not life more than the meat embodied in raiment he gets it talking about our food he gets uh talking about our drink he talks about our clothes he talks about a body huh don't worry about all of that don't think so much about all of that paul didn't jesus didn't all christians that's not their number one priority amen our food our clothes our well-being is not our number one priority amen oh my verse 28 and why take thee thought for raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they tall not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed as one of these ones i don't know what that means the only thing i can figure is that solomon was raiding some kind of beauty huh but he says these are a rating better than what he was huh because when god takes care of you you're in good hands how many i have to be in good hands what i'm reading here brothers this is that god wants you to think about him he wants you to have your focus on him more than anything else because he thinks about you more than anything else [Music] don't get me going even solomon was in the raid like all of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is how many know the little rain that we get the bible says that god brings the rain he's the one that brings the showers i know some of us sister picky are thinking praise god for the rain we needed some rain it's just like a revival you can't pump it up you can't brew it up it has to be a sovereign come down by the holy ghost and it's got to give you a revival got to give you inspiration aren't you glad for it now notice which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe ye o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what are we going to eat what are we going to drink where we thought shall we be clothed for after all these things to the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things praise be to god i may know that if you are a son of god you are an heir of god you're an heir to the father and the father promised you he will fix it he will take care of you whatever your need is i'm so happy that i don't have to go one day without him you don't have to go one day without him not one minute without him no matter what comes your way when you commit it to god and believe god you'll see miracles god is not a miracle working god of the past he's a miracle working god of the day he's a working of miracles of god god we don't need just a god of a history in brother bramstein we need that same god here this morning we need him to raise the dead to heal the sick they open up the eyes of the blind we need him to cast out devils cast out lukewarm that was cast out the devils of depression hallelujah now i want to go to the scripture that was inspired to me to begin with found in corinthians i believe it is my father is rich in houses he holds the wealth of the world in his hands amen and i'm in there i'm in here glory i'm in there i'm just glad to be there you want to know what you're an heir of if you're a christian what are you in there of now i just showed you that if you're in there of god you have a heavenly father now he cares about the clothing where he goes about every detail about you let that sing in old people young people god cares about every detail of you he cares about whether you got clothes to wear food to eat and so forth i never even finished it did i no later on he says but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things might be added unto you no a resounding no shall be added on to you it will i sit down don't run around so much i'm telling you that's so awesome to think that it shall be added unto you it'll be you'll be taken care of i can't do the devil devil you can't touch me because there's somebody between us unless he lets you the devil was robbed of every right that he had at calvary he was stripped of all of his rights he has no rights whatsoever anymore amen praise the lord okay so this is where i got the thinking you know maybe eventually they'll take your home your land who knows what they'll do we don't have no idea what's ahead do we we don't know how bad it's going to get other than the bible says that you won't even be able to buy ourselves huh maybe you won't be able to buy but y'all sell your house if you wanted to they do whatever they kind of want to do right but that's okay that's okay because i want to tell them something i want to say this it's mine anyway it belongs to me can i just quote you a scripture you want you want would you like some kind of contract would you like some kind of word brother don't just say that you can't just say that the bible has to say it all right matthew 5 5 the meek shall inherit the earth the meat shall inherit the earth paul said it this way let no man glory in men for all things are yours [Laughter] uh we ain't happy enough about that we really aren't that's in first corinthians 3 and verse 21 for paul says all things are yours whether apoll or apollos or the world the world he had the same tone that jesus said the saints shall or this meek shall inherit the earth the world or life praise be to god he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son hath not life ye who were once dead in sins and trespasses has god made it alive or quickened so how many knows life is yours the holy ghost's mind holy ghost is mine life is mine life's today's mind why because i told satan get the behind life today i'm living glory remember this by the way i'm saying about going into a hotel room and have naked women running around their underwear drinking and so forth with wedding rings and everything else probably teachers he grabbed one by the ham she she yelled out first she says this is life he says no this is dead [Music] huh that is death [Music] what you're experiencing this morning is life he came to give us lies and more abundantly the devil comes to seal your life with cancer and sickness he comes to rob you of your joy your peace he tries to rob you of everything he'll rob you of everything up to like brother danny said wendy your mind to control your mind and bring a place of torment because i know for a fact i tell you right now the things that you think on and so forth and the way that you go amen it'll make you want to blow that thing away yeah it'll make you so miserable when you get away from righteousness and god and you get into sins and having a condemned conscience i was riding the four-wheeler yesterday with my grandkids and i turned to him and i said children remember this always do the right thing in life through your teens through your 20s through your 30s always do the right thing because if you don't that thing will haunt you till the day you die folks might think of my past my failures and so forth it still haunts me it still comes to my mind and i still hate it [Music] huh you'll always hate the wrong that you did but you'll always be glad for the right that you did so it doesn't matter what it is brother joe always do the right thing we haven't when we don't we pay for it we remember it we got to repent of it amen so just don't compromise when you know there's something wrong and there's a right take the right it doesn't matter how much it hurts or how much you have to squirm do what's right the best thing you'll ever do is accept the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord get filled with the holy ghost michael that's the best thing you'll ever do is when you get filled with god turn your life over to god and say here i am lord do with me what you please this is a brand new start for me amen all right or life or death whoa you mean death is mine death is mine [Music] it's mine yeah didn't didn't it say that jesus conquered death hell and the grave yeah if he conquered you're an heir with him you conquered it too you don't even have to fear it anymore you couldn't like myself passwords and say no this is my this is my graduation here this is the best time of my life come on don't get pride on me boy if there's anything i can do brother glenn invest anything i can do is to get you so ready so that you'll be happy when you come to taking that last breath you'll know where you stand you'll know where you're going you'll know who you have believe it and am persuaded that he is more than able to finish that which he has started he'll be there he was there when i have needs in life yeah he was there all the time and he's not going to leave me now be there praise be to god even death it belongs to you you say come on horsey get in that buggy and take me into the presence of god yep yep yep huh you know what the prophet said it ain't nothing but a horse and a buggy a vehicle to carry you over that's all it is it serves you you don't serve it i'm so scared i don't know be merciful ah no you don't serve it it serves you paul said oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory but i thank god who gives us the vic through jesus christ our lord i mean glad for victory you inherit victory you inherit forgiveness you've inherited justification you inherit redemption you inherit fellowship you inherit eternal life you hear inherit power over the devil you inherit everything that you have made up you inherit a checkbook of god that is signed on every check and all you gotta do is seal it out

dollars you can't buy toy you can't buy peace no it is freely given to you you inherit it when you come into christ when you give christ your life i am a witness praise god i didn't think i was gonna

come hungry he'll feed you his presence is so awesome you know god has been so good to us church he's worked many miracles in here and i just and you know we're all a miracle from where he brought us from and where he's got it and i go back and i don't i don't think of of not being raised right because i had the best parents in the world but i had to have a change in my heart and my life i had to recognize that i needed jesus christ because i was just a young smart aleck person headed to death by a way of driving like an idiot but god spared me rich in his mercy he cared for me and i look back sometimes and i think where would i be without the grace of god in my life where would i be today i can tell you this much i wouldn't be here but i'm so thankful that he loves me he cared for me and whenever satan tells you you're nothing say satan i just want to remind you something before there was ever you before the foundation of the world god thought of me he thought of me and i'm thankful
