only one thing that can satisfy we've tried things we tried running here and there we might have tried things in the world we've tried religion but there's one thing we finally found and that satisfies us and that's your presence within us Lord and all we long is to see more of that and father tonight we've gathered here together to see a greater revelation of you a greater manifestation of the life of Jesus Christ Lord won't you come and speak because we know that's how it comes because there's one satisfaction that satisfies this thirst and that's you father you're the only one who can do it father so Lord we're thirsty tonight each one comes we're tired we're out from halfway through the week already Lord Jesus and it just it wears us down but tonight will you refresh us with a drink Lord From The Throne of God we ask this Lord expecting it to happen because it's your word and it's your promise I ask this in your name amen amen God bless you this evening it's so good to be here again I really appreciate the opportunity to come up here and share what's on my heart and just just the atmosphere you walk in here and it's just like this is just a good place to be it's a good place to be I'm gon to read from uh Hebrews 11 we're going to read a couple verses there Hebrews 11 amen I pray everyone's doing well fighting the devil you know it's it's all always good when you're when you're back there and you get ready to come out and you hear the song service and the songs that are being sung and you realize you the same holy spirit that anointed me to say anointed that song leader that special or something to to sing and that special we just heard it just it's just it's what I'm gonna preach tonight it is it's just that daily walk just get up in the morning and go about your business that's all you got to do Hebrews 11:5 it says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God you may be seated he pleased God ain't that amazing what a what a testimony recognize this wasn't this wasn't Enoch claiming that this was God claiming that God gave him the testimony hey you're pleasing me and so he walked right out of here in his own personal rapture we know that's a type of us we're going to have to have that Enoch walk and we're going to walk right out of here here in our Rapture and the tribulation Goes On Noah is the type of going through the tribulation but we're going to be out of here are we pleasing God that's all we have to do find out are we pleasing God because if we're pleasing God you have a guaranteed Rapture coming up that's all there is to it Brent it's guaranteed you say it's impossible how in the world can I please God well if you look at it from your point of view of your flesh you're right you cannot please God if you depending on your flesh but we don't have confidence in our flesh confidence in the promise of God estation of it happening in our lives as we go about our business dayto day it's absolutely happening and you can look at that and in spite of all satan says to you oh Satan hates that P positive that positive testimony yes you are you know how I know that because you're right where he want you to be tonight and that's right here so there you go what more are you looking for that's what we're doing here friends we're here because we want to please God because when we please God then he had such a we're not grieving him away we're doing what he wants us to do look look let me ask you something has God asked you to do something that you haven't done then what more can you ask for what more can he ask than just to do what he asked you to do that's what you're doing why are you not doing something else you need get a little bit spiritual you get a little bit more religious you need to do a little bit more we're gonna cover that tonight we're g to smack that devil in the face because you don't need to be doing a little bit more you morning go about your business go to bed at night and tomorrow you do the same thing and you're going to walk right into a rapture a by faith you can't please him I don't care how religious you are how many rules you fou everything you're doing you are not pleasing God because you're just being religious and God never asked you just to be religious he said walk by faith because without faith it's impossible to please him for he that comes to God must believe that he is and he is rewarder than that diligently seek him and so people take that and Satan will take that and push your path you need to diligently seek God you need to really be you need to really try you no you don't by faith you simply do by faith what's Faith it's a revelation that makes it so simple well what is Faith I got to have great faith no you have to have normal a everyday average Faith that's what the prophet said it's just normal Faith you don't have to be Supernatural super faithful some of you have great gifts of faith I'm not talking about that but just to walk your daily walk you just need the same Faith you get up in the morning and turn on the light switch that's all it is friends why are we trying to make it something more than that so what is Faith it's a revelation Abraham what he wanted to do what did he do he came to Abraham and said Abraham I want you do this this and this Abraham said okay and that made him righteous it's too simple friends that's the reason people going to miss the Rapture it's too simple they cannot believe it could be that simple a re is God telling you either what to believe or what if you do that you're pleasing to God look look friends it's not a maybe there's not a guess well maybe if I do this maybe if I give a little more in the offering maybe if I have this brother preach uh Pray For Me Maybe if I pray a little bit more here maybe there's not a maybe to it you're just gonna be like Kane Kan well maybe if I do this and maybe if I worship this way there's not a maybe you do what God told you to do and just sit there and be satisfied what what he told you to do when he tells you to believe something you believe it you confess it when he tells you to do something you go do it and that's how you please God because that's Faith it's not a hope so guess so well maybe I should do this maybe I should do that no he told me directly exactly what to do it's a cut and dry decision he said this is what I want you to do I want you to work here I want you to do this I want you to raise your kids I want you to go to this church this is your pastor I want you to give this and the offering I want you to this and you just keep doing what he tells you you to do by Revelation but friends without the Revelation you can have the longest hair in the world you got the longest dress you can do everything exactly following the same rules and God says you're not pleasing me at all your religion he doesn't want you trying real hard he simply wants you to believe what he told you and just walk in that Faith because that's impossible to please him besid that there's no guessing about this let's go back to Hebrews that fourth verse right there right before that 11:4 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts it wasn't able he wasn't say look how look how righteous I am no God testified by accepting the sacrifice he said by it he being dead yet speaketh so you said well then what was the difference between can and Abel why was Cain not accepted because he was not walking in faith Abel was walking in faith God came to look look Abel didn't guess he didn't look at Kan and said let me see God didn't accept his fruit and vegetables maybe where it no no no let me see let's let's let's try a sheep let's try a lamb there are no guessing God told him exactly what he required he has told you exactly what you he requires of you it's not a guess well if I hope I live good enough to go in the rapture you ain't going to there ain't no guessing friends God tells you exactly what he wants you to do and you go do that and then you say I am pleasing God be more me to do and I'm pleasing him while I do it don't let Satan talk you into becoming more religious because you feel like you're everyday walk you're just kind of non-spiritual I just go I work I take care of what are you looking for yeah that's right what super spiritual thing do you think you need to be doing tell me what's more spiritual than pleasing God tell me what's more spiritual than walking in faith doing he told you to do God never revealed to Cain he said what Cain had an excuse no he didn't he could have waited Cain didn't wait until he had a clear-cut decision he said well what if God didn't come to Cain and tell him then he could have watched and what see what Abel did and he see this is what I accept if and he didn't God come to a to Cain and said if you would do what Abel did I'll accept you look at that attitude to serpent seed and God so loved the world that he would even say I know your serpent se but Cain you didn't choose to be that and I'm G give you a chance how do you treat Sinners oh right how do we treat them oh that old dirty old nasty person it's not how Jesus treated him you know he go you know he had the hardest time with the religious folks the one sitting in message pews with that Pharisee attitude look how holy I am God's will humbles us he humbles us and all all all Ken had to do was sit there and wait and and wait and pray and he's waiting and then he sees Abel accept he said well okay that must be it let me go get a sheep hey hey Abel can I can I borrow one your lambs of course he would have been accepted but he couldn't do that he couldn't do it his nature was wrong humbles us this is a quote from Brother Brams he said this other morning I said to the wife he said I'm already 50 honey if I do anything for the Lord I got to hurry sounds pretty good doesn't it she said Bill God trained Moses years and said he can train you for another 50 years to get one day service from you oh sassy wife said he's got a purpose for you so just stand still I thought that's a lot of wisdom God gave him the right wife he said don't get ahead of God don't go try to do something just stand still God got a purpose for you and when he wants you to do it you'll do it don't get ahead of well I got a gift to do this I got a gift to do that good when God wants to put it in action in It season he'll put you in action when he wants to use that gift he he'll do that when he wants you to sing a special he'll put you up there to sing a special whatever it is that he wants you to do just wait for him and do the way he does it it's too simple friends it's too simple we got to do something I said I thought that's a lot of wisdom stand still God moves every hand just according to his great plan just be S be still don't try to push you get ahead of him then it's a whole lot better to try to foul him than the lead because he's the leader don't try to push don't try to accomplish something well there's got to be a third pull there there's got to be more God brings that to pass in its season every seed has a season friend that's right think about this let me get off my subject just a little bit in in season every seed will come forth in its season if it comes in a different time it will die that's why you brothers and sisters you mom and dads you keep praying for your kids because in season that seed is going to come to life you can't make it happen you can't preach him into it you can't pray him into it but in season that seed that's in there were gonna come to life right when it's supposed to and if you just keep prodding and prodding and prodding it's not going to because they're just going to resist but you will put it in God's hand and say God I claim that I I put the token over them they are going to come because they are mine and you gave them to me and you just hide and watch and they're going to come into life one day that's all it is friend you got it's got to be in season that goes for your healing that goes for deliverance everything else God could deliver you for everything you want to be delivered from right now but he said this is not the SE I'm going to wait six more months for you to walk in faith and then I'm going to bring it to pass excuse me a second friends it's in season look at yourself look at how many of us how many of us were out in the world running here and running there finding just misery misery misery then all of a sudden one time something got a hold of us and it starts dragging us here and dragging us there and in season that seed came to life and here you said now how did that happen because you got religious were you going out there serving the devil and one day say you know what Satan I'm tired of you let me go serve Christ now oh no you never you never sought God at all God sought you he came and found you in that place you are and just because you might not have been in the world you still need a Salvation just like the rest of us maybe even more because you thought you were pretty good but you weren't you were just as rotten as the rest TR of us and God came there and he dragg you out of that and you look back and say God look where I was at down there in that cess pool of the world and you came all the way down there to get me out now can you not trust someone who loves you enough to do that let me just be really nasty raw would you jump into a porta potty to save somebody oh that's just too much that's what he did except it worse than that yes you ever think of what what happened when when he walked out of Gethsemane the anointing off him just a man and he had all the sins think of every sin you've ever done and how horrible you felt torture all the horrible things you done and and just that that sense of GI it so hard and here he was walking out like that feeling every one of them how in the world could he even walk yeah that's what he done for you well well then what do I get what do I have to do for him then just believe that he did it for you don't be don't be more complicated don't be more complicated brother BR said who taking thought can add one cubit to a statue we must do what we can with what we have to do with what God has ordained us to do if you'll stay right in your calling and abide there God will use you if you try to step over and do something something else you'll find yourself wrecked up somewhere it's always that way and that's human race you find it doing that we always got to find something more we got to do something that we can be we can be uh glorified like this you know we want to be I want to be some I want to be a great preacher I want people to say brother Phil you're one of the best preachers go yeah now you're lying like we all like people to say good things about about us really enjoyed that special I did but does it puff you up you just say well that's just the grace of God absolutely absolutely amen this is also how Jesus himself walked when he was here in flesh listen to this in John 8:28 then Jesus said unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as of as my father hath taught me I speak these things Jesus himself that body walking to there did not do anything on his own he waited until it was revealed to him of the father what he should do the holy spirit said come and said say this say this do this do this and he waited until the father told him what to do Jesus himself did not go and just wing it that's right sent me is with me the father ha not left me alone why not he said for I do always those things that please him you want the father to be with you always I just keep I keep stumbling over this I keep it's too Simple Phil it's too simple how can it be that to go in the Rapture to be the Enoch of this day you just do what he tells you to do and you just keep walking that obedience you were talking about just obey him that's right Amen Let me let me just keep moving I'm I'm kind of taking too much time here thank you I got I gota as he spake these words many believed on him ain't that amazing they believed on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him go ahead and put yourself in that to those message Believers you heard the message you believe it right if ye continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth the big question is are you going to continue he brought you this far he promised to take you the rest of the way he said whatever he started he's going to finish we're going to believe that we're just going to keep walking like that are we going to try to push ahead of him said I just don't feel very spiritual anymore I just need a little bit more I just need another what do you need more what do you need more look friends once you're born again quit worrying about if you're born again quit arguing with the devil if you're born again or not I was praying here a couple weeks ago I think I don't think I've said this here I was praying and and my prayer was something like this God if this is right if if I'm right I so sincere oh so sincere God if this is right and and I'm I'm I'm walking in the light then and he just rebu me stopped me right there he said what do you mean if yeah after all I've done for you after all I've told you after all I've spoke to you and you're sitting there if I'm right if I'm born again if he said I don't want to hear that junk out of your mouth anymore you confess what I said to you and if comes from Fear any if comes from doubt any if comes from unbelief any if comes from Hell once he has revealed it to you who you are and you go anything back on that you're backslid I I still make so many mistakes [Music] okay and what does have that have to do with it I'm sorry what you're trying to have confidence in your flesh is that what you I overcome no you didn't you just got another Spirit of Pride instead of what you were dealing with you didn't overcome anything yet dead so these people that believed him these beli they said to him they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God they wanted to please God just like we all want to please God everyone wants to please God so they said Jesus what can we do to to do the works of God he gave them an answer they did not like Jesus answered said to them this is the work of God that you keep all the law that you go to the synagogue that you wear your clothes correct that you don't drink this that you do this no he didn't you don't know what he said this this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he ha sent I want a law to keep they love their law the Jews they love that law because it made them they could do something that made them feel religious and made them feel spiritual they could kind of Lord it over look at all those Sinners out there who are not living as good as I am don't even think that that's not in the message all over the place because we have the same thing that's why we're preaching this tonight because that spirit is there so that we can look down on those poor Baptists those poor Catholics those poor Amish who aren't as revelated as we are that's the wrong approach friend believe on him who he has sent he Jesus Christ and he sent a message to every age he sent a church age Messenger to that age and then under that messenger he sent a five-fold Ministry and brother and sister if you want to go in the Rapture you believe on him who he has sent which is the ministry that he sent to you and you need to know who that is and you need to know that this brother here is your pastor if you don't have that Revelation yet what are you doing here that's right if you don't have that Revelation yet where are you go what why are you doing here brother and sister you need to know that you know that God put you here because if you're not in the right Church in the right place you're not going to the Rapture anyways because God has you fing that role somewhere else you have to know what you're doing it's not a guess it's well my family goes here so I'll go here well brother and sister you need to know by Revelation where you're supposed to be who your pastor is and sit under the ministry God says and when the pastor calls someone in that God brings God puts on his heart to bring in a Ministry then be under that Ministry while he's here because it was God telling him to do it it's not a guess it's not well I just I don't like that P that preacher very well so I'm just gonna take it off this evening I'm just gonna not gonna show up or I don't like that I'm just gonna kind of Snooze back here I'm going to do something else brother and sister you do that your own Peril because you're not accepting whom he has sent I ain't bringing I I ain't bringing up P preachers and saying well you got to listen to preacher I'm just telling you God's way of doing things friend this is how he does it oh my it's just that simple the one they they they want to say God you know I want to please God but when it comes down to it they won't do an able sacrifice they want a can sacrifice so they can be exalted so they can have a little something to do with it I want to position to the church I want to do this I want people to see me this way I want to have a reputation have a great faith I I I I who cares what you want there's two people care what you want you and Satan I don't care what you want he said I got my best interest in mine you go ahead and let that eye die and watch me come on the scene that's the way you do it friends that's the way you do it let him come because who wants to see Phil I don't I want to see Jesus Christ I don't want to hear what I have to say I want to hear what he has to say oh brother and sister I want to hear what God has to say tonight and I know that he put this on my heart to bring us so I'm standing in complete confidence knowing that I am speaking what he gave me to say so I have confidence to to tell you that he will speak to your knee tonight if you would just accept him the same way he will take care of what you have need of tonight well I walked out there feeling never felt anything that's what you had need of can you accept that you needed him not to say anything to you personally tonight you needed him he needed you just to sit there in the chair and believe it anyways and have him not a wink of a revelation walked out of here that was kind of boring that's what you got that's what he wanted you to go through to see how it's going to affect you and if you get bored then that's what he had you doing tonight because tomorrow he's going to speak to you or tomorrow two days from now if you will keep the right attitude and not think well I just don't think there's anything to it whatever else you're thinking is that making sense yeah that's the hardest thing to do some time when you're sitting in church and you feel As Dead As midnight and they're around you other people are shouting and jumping and pray what about me pass me not oh General savior where is he anybody you walk out of here thinking I must be backslid well if you confess it you're right yeah walk out here and confess I must be backslid you're right you are because you confess Satan's gospel yeah I heard I heard Tim brother Tim pu say this just a couple days ago he said sometime you have red letter days sometime you have black letter days that got me sometime Jesus Christ speaks to you directly red letter and sometime you're just reading the black letters between yeah you're still reading it you're still believing do that making sense because we are not always walking on the rainbows in the top of the mountain right because where does where does change come down in the valley when you can't feel him if that anointing was on you every time all day long say what could Satan do to you he just like go away but it's when you he lets you become weak he lets you become tired he lets become sick he lets you afflict your body because when your body is sick you're not as strong mentally or spiritually either he lets the stress of Life get to you you weaken down you think oh I got to go to church I got to hear from God and you get up to go after service and it's like well friends that's Enoch's walk that's how you get in the Rapture is you just go home you go to bed you get up tomorrow morning and you do it again yeah it's that simple Jesus talking to the woman at the well John 22 he said ye worship you know not what why they had no Revelation who it was they had their own God of their imagination we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth friends this is the only way to please God is worshiping spirit and Truth we get a lot of times we have a lot of spirit but we don't always have truth well we we have the message of the hour we do have the message of the hour but what has God told you personally because that to Worship in truth it must be the individual Revelation that God gave to you as an individual it's not something he revealed to your pastor not something he revealed to your husband your wife your father whoever it is it has to be your own Revelation it's not off the word it's what's been spoken but God takes that word and reveals it to you and says this is the word for you tonight that's the only way you can worship and truth because that's truth that that that word becomes part of you it becomes flesh Jesus said I am the way the truth and life why because the word had come off the page when was living in flesh that's the only way you can know truth but he also said this he answered said to them well hath Isaiah prophesied to you Hypocrites sweet Jesus calling them Hypocrites as it is written this people honth me with their lips but the heart is far from me why because with their lips they're just like hey I worship you I worship you I praise you I believe you but the heart isn't there without Revelation the heart isn't there how be it in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men because they are looking for something beyond what what what God's doing it cannot be that simple humble sacrifice that Abel had it's got to be something that CED we got to have something going on on our church we got to have something big we have to be something spiritual we have to do something that gets some attention that's just nature that's a human nature friends that's why we go that's why we go through the TR the trials we go through to kill that thing Amen Let me let me just keep going they're trying to be spiritual trying to be religious like Cain let me read this there is a place in their heart that's thirsting for something God created them to thirst but to thirst after him they try to hush that blessed holy thirst with the things of the world why you're perverting the very thing that God gives the people to thirst for him you are trying to satisfy with the things of the world it will not work it never will work anybody who's out there trying to serve the things of the world and you have a seat of God in you you know that you cannot satisfy that thirst it's just impossible and then if the devil can't get you to do that to try to satisfy that thirst with the world he gets you to just get put your name on a church book and call yourself a Christian the devil gets you to do that he tries to satisfy it with that but there is no satisfaction until God himself comes into the heart to control and to satisfy the people and bless them and give them the things that created in their heart he wants to fill that space there's nothing in the world that will fill that don't you all never forget that so brother and sister what Satan does is when he says he he sees he can't keep you out of church he sees you're sincere about serving God then he going to take it he's gonna push you on past it he's going to push you on past just a simple walk like Enoch just a simple walk in faith and he going to but you need to start doing this you need to become more holy you need to start maybe maybe you wear your wear your skirts two inches longer just to show how holy you are maybe brother you should cut your hair just a half an inch shorter just to show how holy you are maybe you should do you know I'm going to start praying four more hours a week just to show how holy I am I'm G start putting a lot more in the offering just to show how holy I am just to show how sincere I am Cain worship God does not accept that at all he said but it's good it's not but they're doing better no they're not they're being deceived legalistic Spirits deceiving those people to think that well if I just try a little bit harder don't try a little bit harder it's simple faith and don't try to work up Faith that's just something in your mind it's why God has told you well God hasn't spoke to me for a while well the last time he spoke to you is where you need to be standing then see the light in the path and the next step you take that step another light you take another step and if there's no light then stand still until you see the next [Applause] light it's the hardest thing you can do friends is fight this battle it's not easy it's you say well brother s brother it seems so simp it's like this it's simple it's not easy that make sense yeah it's very simple it's not complicated but just go try do it some time it's the greatest battle ever fought right it's like this and you have a you have an algebra equation you know covers half the have the wall and I look at that said I am clueless give me two plus two four I can do simple but then he says okay now there's a 100 pound bag of sand I need you to carry that for a mile h that's difficult that's what it is to actually walk in this is difficult but it's simple the whole idea is simple just pick it up and walk and then you finally get it done and he said now pick up two you ain't never going to be done friends we're never going to get easy it never gets to the place oh I got this all wrapped up no you do not you're in a bad place if you think you got it all figured out David he tried to he tried to do God a service without it being his will you've heard that message I'm sure many times DAV could not just be satisfied being King he had to try to get spiritual let's see what brother random says about this he said we see here that David done in the scripture reading of first Chron intentions were good God does not give us merits on Good Intentions that's right but God I'm trying I don't care he don't care about your intentions that's not Faith it's not been revealed he says there's only one way to serve God that's by doing his will at his command that's all it is that's the way to do his will that's how you please God is do his will when he tells you to do it another thing David here we see in his heart he wanted to do something that was good he had no bad something for the Lord check your motive and objective that's a good place to start David had a good motive and good objective and it wasn't enough just because you want to do something that's good does not mean it's God's will you know what David did not do he did not do what Jesus said to do to work the works of God believe on him whom he has sent because consulted with the priest with the military with the captains with all the neighbors everybody you know he did not consent with cons consult with the one whom God has s Nathan the prophet and if you would have gone to there that never would have happened and Nathan would have told him what to do but you got to go to the ministry that God gives you and if you don't you're just winging it you're just winging it don't do that one great thing about God he's not left now without knowing what the truth and how to do it he wouldn't be just to punish us for doing something that we didn't know how to get how it was going to be done and just let us stumble into something he's not that kind of a god he's a God that speaks the word and expects his children to believe it so he said he does not just leave it up to us I try it go see what happens and if you're wrong I'm gonna punish you that's not the kind of God is he he doesn't got you he doesn't play gotcha look at you over there trying to be a Christian got it wrong gotcha go to hell that ain't the way he does it friends he tells us exactly we can know exactly where we are with him at any time we know what we're supposed to be doing hang on a second I got to find a no matter how sincere what good motives and what good objectives and what how people want things done they see the need of it there is a will of God to be carried out in these things that's why they want to drive down right tight for I want to make this so you have have to see it in if the spirit of God dwells in you that's the reason I'm lingering so long no matter how much it's needed how much everybody agrees that it's needed how much that that is the truth yet there's one thing to find out is that the will of God brother and sister sometime the pastor has to put up with brother Thomas I think we should do this brother Thomas I think we should do that or maybe go to the Deacon say Brothers I think we should do that and brothers I think we should do that and then nothing's happened and say well no one listens to me well maybe you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing because it's not the position you've been called to oo oh the papers even fell off after that God has offices that he works through friends yes you don't know what's going on you don't know what brother Thomas is looking at well I think we should do this brother Thomas brother let's pray about it well I think it's a good idea not saying it's not is it is it the season for it is it the person for it God has a way of doing things and sometime we just got to swallow our pride and say okay brother Thomas I'm trusting you leadership the holy spirit it's true friends and on every religious thing they could is the David probably put out advertisement and everything great Revival the ark is going to be brought back we're going to have a Revival we're going to do this he sent singers people with hars with trumpets they' done every religious thing they knew how to do and still God was not in it somewhat what we see repeating again don't we let me just be a little raw we see that all over the message now we see people they're trying to work something up they have these great meetings they have all let's come to this church because we got this going on let's go to that church they got that going on and it's all these things and what are they doing they're doing things that are necessary producing Christ is just producing another Revival so to speak does that makeing sense you FOC they're they're focusing on the wrong thing we're going to get to that in a little bit they took all the singers they took heart players the trumpet blowers the women the men whoever it was that sang they took them they done all there and they went through every religious motion I don't want to say this but I got to say it so as these denominations they Pentecostal and all is going through every religious motion of singing and shouting it's necessary that we sing and we shout and worship but that if that's what you're focusing on you're missing out on your day in this message we need to recognize our day in this message and the seed for this season we got to have the right word in the season David shouted with all his might he screamed he jumped he went through every religious motion there could be and still God was not his motive his objecting everything was right but he went wrong way with it just being religious friends ain't going to get it well I go to church and I praise and I worship that's wonderful but are you born again to begin with that's what you got to have without being born again you're wasting your time now let's see what happened allthough the religious emotional stuff was great their intention was great their Crusade was great their singing was great their dancing was great their shouting was great their music was great and they had the ark the ark is a type of the word they had the word and they had everything they have a need for they have a need for this revival we got to get the word back so people can can console with God everything was exactly right except for one thing it wasn't God's will to do it then and that way they had the ark listen to what he says what goods the ark without God it's just a wooden box a couple tables of stone and let me just say this what good is this book without the revelation of it it's just a piece of paper and leather this will do nothing but send you to hell it's going to condemn you to hell if you don't get the revelation of this word for yourself personally I read the Bible every day so does the devil goodness sakes if he needs to he needs to friend you got to have the it's got to be Faith by faith without faith it's impossible to please God so all the religious acts we do well I read my Bible and pray every day because brother Brown said a Christian does that is doing you absolutely no good if you only reading the Bible and praying because brother said a Christian does that then you have the wrong witness Jesus said I don't even accept John's witness I have a greater witness than John there he was John that great man the greatest man that ever was until that time BR Jesus said there's never never been a greater prophet and yet Jesus said his witness is not enough you cannot take a person's witness you cannot take someone else's idea you cannot take a well brother Thomas says I'm born again so I'm born again brother Thomas wouldn't do that unless God told him to but brother and sister that's not going to be enough because when you come up against Satan and you said well brother Thomas said he gonna say I don't care what brother Thomas said what about you you have to know what personally for yourself you got to have a greater witness brother brand told said to do this and that you need a greater witness you got to do it because God told you to do it I know that don't go over sometime with a lot of people but brother and sister you you have to be able to stand on the revelation God gave you personally thank it's just a wooden box so what is pleasing what is the day what is our day in this message let me let me get over this about 15 minutes and try to be done I don't want to keep you alone brother Ram says this he said now don't just don't interpret nothing if God wants you to know anything he'll send it to you see there it is friends don't try to interpret something you know some time we sit around we fellowship and you you see you know sometime we try to show how spiritual we are by the the the way we can quote and the things we can see and we try to impress people especially preachers he'll send it to you he said so just be real real solid now hold still something has happened and now just be real just be real don't put on something don't put on some kind of religious feather just be real he said you Christ because you take yourself away from God Don't Make Yourself weird don't make yourself odd the holy spirit will make you odd enough let it do it but don't go and try to be weirder OD or different let's see how religious I am you you God in there just talk to me yeah that's right I ain't got time all a sudden they put on this all this religious air especially if they find out you're a preacher yeah just be real then listen to what he says if you can understand it this is that third pull you should have caught that the other day see then just remember there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two now what's he saying he said don't try to produce the third pool the third pool is you just doing Enoch's walk and you're going to walk out of here and don't try to interpret it don't try to produce it don't well I want to speak something to existence well I want to stop the storm well I want to perform Miracles I want all this you do huh you recognize where you're at we're in the end time Leo de Church age it's nothing but pitch black gross Darkness out there we are in the age of judgment all you have to do is walk like Enoch walked how many miracles did Enoch perform how many time did he preach how many times did he raise the dead how many times did he speak storms out of existence we don't hear anything at all his testimony was he W he pleased God he walked with God he was not because he pleased God what more do you want and yet so many message Believers we're all like where's these great things going to start happening when these great things goingon to start happening you know who else is looking for that Satan he's also where's these great things gonna happen and it's happening all around you the greatest thing is happening is happening all around us the church a book and it's it's the Lan Church age and I'm it's a long quote so I kind of chopped it up a little bit you can go read that if you want it's talking about where he's talking about the beginning of the creation of God let to's see if we recognize our day and our this message what God is looking for how do we get this Enoch walk the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus says he is he's the beginning of the creation God the words should be he is the beginner or author of the creation of God so he's a creator of a finished physical creation so there he was Jesus Christ and he created everything let there be let there be and it's a finished creation the old creation right then what is this new creation the beginning of the creation of God is talking about a new creation right but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who who he is in this last age remember it's in this last age he's standing revealing who he is and one of the things he calls himself is the begning or the beginner of the creation of God he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation oh I'm going to get happy this has to do with the church you say yeah he was that New Creation yes but it also has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as a spirit of God came he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from where his body was born am it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human oam supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing the body that would not have produced the last Adam of whom it was said ly body hast thou the father who prepared me God not Mary provided that body Mary was a human incubator and she carried that holy child brought him to birth brother and sisters it's like this here was Mary she was old creation but God came and he put that seed in her which was a new creation and she brought forth it was not old creation it was literally a new creation you all believe that don't you know that that's why he was not Jew he was not Gentile he was God himself a complete New Creation not part of the old creation at all but he was just the [Music] beginning oh Hallelujah there's got to be an end to it there's got to be more to it than just the [Applause] beginning he said he brought she brought forth that holy child brought him to birth it was a God man the new creation is a God man God woman he was the son of God he was of the new creation man of God met and joined he was the first of this new new race he is the head of this new race it's not a oneman race it's a many membered body race he was the alpha of this new creation this new race and there's got to be an Omega of this new race and it was dark it was Shadow it was Cloud day all the way from alpha to Omega with the evening time there shall be light this evening Tabernacle not just the name uh the even light Tabernacle not just the name of this building but it's the name of the people inside who are manifesting that there is a new creation there is something going on inside and it's in this old creation but this old creation contains a new creation and it is absolutely bringing this old creation into subjection because we must be the manifestation of that Omega creation that Omega race that is what we get to [Music] do this age that's why the seals are open because that could produce that pure work could produce you a a complete New Creation like they had at the very beginning where the first that is this day in this message do you recognize follow the rules if I can just go to church no there is a new creation happening and you if you're born again and it's actually going to take and change this whole body one day and make this part of the new creation when he was in Mary that new creation came to came to fruition and was separated from that Old creation but in you it's not that way he put that seed in you before you were born you came to Earth with that in there and in it right season when it was the time for that creation to come to life that creation was birthed by the pure word which took you all the way back to a Justified State you never sinned in the first place your body might have your old nature might have done that but your new nature never did it it has never sin that Soul has never sinned it cannot sin it's been sealed away abolutely New Creation just like Adam was formed it's also been formed amen even more than Adam was formed out of the old creation the dust this new thing was not formed Out of the Dust it was formed out of the spoken word of God it was a complete new creation and it's going to stay in there until it's time to bring the rest of this creation to place that that's what we're doing here that's what we're doing that's what it means to walk like Enoch walk because what more can you ask for than that what more than just know that as I walk through my life I am a new creation and here I walk and [Music] Satan hates me can't stop me creation because he has no no hold on it he still has a hold on this flesh never touched that new creation he has nothing to touch it with throw that in his face when it comes against you take him just push that in his face and saying I want you to know something I am a new creation and I know it and God knows it and now you know it too he recognizes Faith he backs down for Faith you want to walk with faith you want to please God you keep walking like that and he will back down in front of you because he cannot stand in the face of real faith now try to produce that try to produce a new creation go ahead someone stand up and create something see how ridiculous it is when we get ahead of God when we try to do something well I'm gonna try to be more religious I'm gonna try to be more spiritual create something that's that's the message of this hour is that you are a new creation that's what the seals open for that's what the message so the pure seed and that's what it produces man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race Colossians 1:18 he is the head of the body of the church who was beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he I have preeminence there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus unto good works Ephesians 4:24 and he that and that he put I'm sorry and that ye put on the new man which after God has created in righteousness and true Holiness look look friends that's why that's why when the seals were open they didn't had to write more to this it's all in there it was all in there look at Paul saying all these things about new creation and yet Paul didn't have the same understanding we do because of the books had book hadn't been open opened yet ain't that amazing it was not the season for it this is the season for it for us to realize who we are oh when not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is New Creation it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of [Music] man do you see what the new race is is God created in the form of man be recognized who you are iare no I don't think that I know I am man that's who the prophet said Do you believe our Prophet then he said you are a God man you are a god God woman you are God and man God and woman United in a way that hasn't been done since the alpha bride Now by his Spirit he's creating many sons into himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his cre this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election oh my election there it is is you didn't even get to choose he didn't even depend on your choice by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinate them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will not your will he wasn't depending on your will he was oh I sure hope brother Thomas is choose right because I want him to be part of my right come on brother Thomas I sent someone to preach get come no no he said when that time for that seed to come to life there's no devil in hell could keep it from coming because in It season it's going to come to life every one of you every one of us in It season it comes to life and you can look back and you can see look at the difference in my life this just explains it all friends yes well God does not just want fellowship with you under the blood all right you better you better explain that one [Laughter] before under the blood of bulls and goats God got a fellowship from a distance because the sin was covered under the blood of Jesus Christ true fellow that Union but then when the bride started mix the word down through the church ages he couldn't marry her that's right all the way down he couldn't marri her because she still had false seed that's why the seals had to be open because it brought pure seed and then it was no more two they become one yeah it's like it's like a man and woman you're married right you're one but there's two bodies that's down through the church ages it ain't that way anymore there's not two anymore you're one you can live brother Bram said you can live such a life that Satan can't find you all he seus Christ this so this so flesh needs to die doesn't it to get our buttons pushed it's like this you could bake a cake right you have eggs you have flour you have bacing soda you have chocolate you have chocolate whatever you're G to put in there right you have all these different ingredients mix them together and bake it find the individual ingredients you can it's one let me put it this way now during the church let's say you had two pieces of iron and you're gonna M weld them together but you can still see where the weld is this is where they old one piece this the throw them back in the furnace and they melt down together you pull them out find the individual iron and the great part about this in this day he did not use two old people pieces of iron he he created two new ones the word for this day manifest in flesh creating Christ in you the hope of glory that's what it is when when brother BR preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed put yourself in that word you are the mystery of God revealed he say oh brother Phil that's really pushing it no it's not you are the Christ in this day if you are the Living Word in this day you are Christ in this day you're not the one we pray to but that the Living Word Christ is the Living Word that's who you are friends you are the Living Word in this day a new creation a new race and all he wants you to do is walk what greater thing can you have than that well brother Phil Phil I perform Miracles I've raised the dead I've healed the sick I'm a new creation what's greater because false anointed ones can heal the sick and raise the dead and preach and shout and everything else and completely go to hell but if you're part of a new creation you can't go to hell you can't you're Christ let me finish up elected to this God Witnesses it God Witnesses testifies that you please pleas him because if he wouldn't please with you he'd tell you to do something different ain't that right brother bandam said he doesn't let you just stumble along without telling us exactly what he wants so if he wants you to be doing some else he'll come to you say brother Caleb I want you to do this I want you do that and Caleb's gonna do it but as long as he's not telling you to do something different you just keep walking the way he told you to walk it's too simple it's just too simple so do you recognize our day our message we are the manifestation of it now I got one more thing to say and this might get a little raw do we really believe what I just said let me ask you something I know this can't happen but just play along with me what if you knew Jesus Christ was going to walk through that door and come to church tonight the body that was crucified he's going to walk through you and you knew that brother Thomas put out the word hey everybody Jesus Christ in flesh is gonna be in the church tonight would you have come with a different attitude would you have dressed different would you have been more sincere that's good if you believe what I preached he did he walked through that door he every time that door opens he walks through that door every time you have church Jesus Christ in flesh walks through that door that's right how do you treat him how do you treat him because if you would treat that body if you would treat that body different than you treat him here you're a respector of persons you're sinning a great sin that brother and sister well I don't know if they had the holy ghost or not well that shows that you probably need it yourself that hurts but brother and sister that's your attitude you're gonna treat them different just because maybe they don't that's the way you treat Sinners how did Jesus treat Sinners Judas son of predition let's have a last supper sit beside me Judas yeah Judas come to the Garden of Gethsemane friend you think he meant that yeah or was he a hypocrite he treated Judas the same way he treated everyone else and so he said when are you gonna betray me none of them looked ah it's Judas we knew it not a single one he did not treat him different hanging on on the cross did he love those people yeah and forgive him or was he just doing that because he was supposed to do you do it because you're supposed to or do you love great way to stop huh whatever your motive is whatever you're doing God's going to bring you to the place you need to be every one of us who are predestinated ordained to go in the Rapture is going in the Rapture and the way you're going to get there is you're going to have the same testimony God's going to testify that you are pleasing me that's what puts you there amen is that all right I had I needed I guess not brother and sister it comes down to that God takes it serious right he preaches it he tells us these wonderful things he tells us who we are but then he also holds that standard really high says now I need you to walk here but now don't don't don't go and walk there just well I'm going to try hard I'm going to try I'm going to start being nicer to my brother and sister be nice I'm not saying not to be nice but recognize that's not what he's saying it's to recognize Christ in you and recognize Christ in each other and then you're naturally it's just going to come out naturally that you start treating people the way you should treat them you're going to start treating because you recognize that this is your nature your old Nature has gone to that new creation it just treat people that way it loves people it tells people the truth it is not rude it's not you know what I'm talking about it's just it's just a person that it just expresses God's love that's what I'm gonna say it expresses God love and brother and sisters that's all he's asking for you is die to yourself get out of the way so he can love through you so that when people see you they see Christ that's all he's looking for I I look that's what's going to put you in a Rapture amen Lord Jesus we're so grateful you would come tonight and Speak Lord Jesus I believe that I believe you had you said what you wanted to said I just pray that the word would let it have the effect that you want it to have
