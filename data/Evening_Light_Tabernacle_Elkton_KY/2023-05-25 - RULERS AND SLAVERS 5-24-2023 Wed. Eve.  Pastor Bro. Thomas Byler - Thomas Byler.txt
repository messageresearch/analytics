amen tonight couldn't be here may God richly bless you amen as we see what the Lord will have for us I am just a waiter so don't complain about what's coming on the plate amen and I was thinking you know well you ordered it but you didn't even ordered it you don't even get to order your own food amen God knows what you have need of isn't that right and he knows just what to bring to you amen so amen the Lord just laid on my heart amen but a little thought with the help of the Lord I believe it's I mean I I call it rulers and slavers rulers and slavers amen God just give me going through today brother John and that's what come to me he said well I believe that's what we'll speak on Amen amen so God bless you tonight this will be part two actually another part of really maturity and so forth and amen we'll just call it part two but amen and so I believe that we're coming to an age and a time to where God is doing something in somebody getting them ready for a translation getting them ready to fulfill the rest of the scriptures that's to be fulfilled how many believes that and I certainly trust that we are part of that amen so God bless you tonight let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you this evening Lord and we want to thank you Father for a wonderful day that you have given us we thank you for all benefits Lord Jesus if by being your child Lord and well Lord we just can't even begin to think of it all or say it all or even mention it all but lord it's such a wonderful privilege to know that we're your child father and that we're in your hands and in your care Lord and under your supervision supervision and under your domain and under your rulership father and we're just so grateful father to be able to assemble ourselves together on this Wednesday night Lord no doubt tired from the Sun beating down on us working hard Lord but it's a good sacrifice to come when we don't feel like it or when we're tired Lord so father we ask Lord that you just give us the inspiration now to speak what we feel Lord that you've laid upon our heart to speak keep me from saying anything Lord in the flesh or out of the way but just what would be pleasing to you and Lord and what you have ordained for me to speak tonight God keep me in your perfect will bless the ears of the years Lord and the hearts of the year of the years Lord Lord that we might go from here Lord Jesus closer and better equipped Lord Jesus to serve you we love you Lord and we ask God you'll just bless now in Jesus Christ's name amen turn your bibles if you will we've got a lot of places to go but I just like to go to the Book of Revelations it's really a hard uh hard place to start amen so we'll just amen let's just begin with Revelations perhaps the first chapter Revelations 1. amen Revelations 1 and we'll begin with verse 4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which was and which which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our own sins and in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and forever amen turn to Revelations 20 also really good let's go to Revelations 20. and I saw an angel come down from heaven heavy the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years praise the Lord aren't you glad to hear that let me know the old devil is going to be tied up one of these days and he won't be able to do nothing amen that's thus saith the scripture isn't that right and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and said they seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no longer no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed for a little season now notice here and I saw Thrones amen they're not Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned or ruled amen foreign with Christ a thousand years but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death had no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years amen notice I said over in Revelation the first chapter he made his Kings and Priests here he talks about being Priests of God and of Christ shall rule with him for a thousand years may God add his Blessing to the reading in the words you can be seated tonight these two scriptures saying that thought ruling just took me I mean kind of into the future for one thing amen but we want to certainly reply it to today and hour that we're living in but um I think about the Millennium there talks about how many notes called the millennial reign amen the millennial Reign and when Christ will reign supreme and his subjects will reign with him or rule with him amen and I you know I get to thinking of how that it talks about how that they'll be the Nations out there and the peoples of the notion he talks about Nations different nations we know uh that uh uh the city of course a new Heaven and a new Earth this will be after the Millennium so forth but it talks about the new city that comes down out of heaven and so forth and hiding its 1500 Miles Square I believe the prophet of God said in that right in 1500 miles high if I'm not wrong it takes you know 1500 miles what uh I guess close to California for almost the United States from what I understand you know just a really really big place Bob May knows that just the United States is a very small portion of the whole Earth there's still a lot of places you know a lot of places and a lot of different things and so you know the scope of your mind and the scope of my mind of what heaven's gonna be like the new city and all of that we just I don't think that we can even fathom or begin to Fathom what it's really going to be like and actually those that are out in the Nations they're so different kinds of people I don't know at all I certainly don't understand at all and so I do know that brother Donnie has preached many times on the millennium um and different ones and uh you know I mean taking it here the gospel and all these the things you know and uh you know you know you can't condemn somebody that never knew right and so but God knows all about that isn't it right and who will be out there just what will be going on but we know that the Bride of Jesus Christ that's watched by the blood she'll be in that New Jerusalem or in that that new city isn't that right and also the bride is partakers of the first resurrection isn't that right be planning on being a part of that first resurrection amen so I'll tell you what if you don't have a screaming fit right now whenever you get over there and realize hey you know I'm part of the first resurrection the second doesn't have an even a chance on me amen so you made it praise be to God we look forward to that but when we get over there and knowing that now the second part I want to bring out is knowing that this Earth here the cities here and Brother Band are talking about all the natural types of spiritual isn't that right and everything here is a type of what's going to be like over there so I don't know just what it'll be like but somehow or other there's going to be dominions there's going to be uh Thrones there's gonna be uh you know cities and so forth I know in a thousand years well there will be build houses another won't inhabit and all the things that'll be going on Amen and so and even we'll be we'll be given rulerships each and every one of us will be given ruler ships now tonight's message really has to do with uh if we claim to be sons of God and we all believe that if you're born again that you're a Son of God how many believes you're a son and a daughter of God tonight we want to look with the help of the Lord of what that really means amen a little bit more of what that means because uh it you know it's a wonderful thing just to be able to get together and talk about what that means because you know you know it's not just some kind of a fairy tale it's not some kind of a sales pitch isn't that right but it's a true word of God it's the actual facts of everything and if we uh you know if we are to know who we are become an invincible Army because of the faith we have and what we know then we certainly want to know about more about who we are and what we are amen and so that we don't want to try to do that with the help of the Lord but like I said what's going to be over there it's just going to be a great all I can think of what comes to mind is what the prophet of God what he told us when he went over beyond the curtain of time and he only now notice he only he only seen as far as I know he only seen those who were saved from this believing the message of the hour those who were his Converse isn't that right and then he's seen millions and millions over there amen but he only got to see those that were first soap so to speak speak under the altar waiting for the full time to come because even he couldn't go see Jesus yet isn't it right because that's what he wanted to do but he couldn't go see Jesus because you know he says no you can't do that you know you nobody gets privileged and go see him we're gonna wait till everybody comes and so forth but he got to see the realm of the saved and he made such a profound statement when he talked about he says there's no words in the alphabet in there right there's no words that he could express or talk to you or say to you to tell you how wonderful it is amen so that gives you a little bit of an imagination of what it must be that no words can actually describe it as Beyond perfect Beyond Supply and beyond all of that just somewhere way out there that you can't even imagine if that's that way with just that realm What's it gonna be like when we see him coming in clouds of glory and so forth and we see him go home to heaven to be with him for a few and a half years and then after that going to the Millennium and my we can just met so when talking about the rain talking about rulership and so forth we just begin to think about how wonderful it's going to be and the only expression that I can express with it is he said you know whatever you do don't miss it amen whatever you do don't miss it amen and that's what he talked about perfect love he said you know whatever it is there was nothing but perfect love there so if you haven't got that perfect love make sure that you got that perfect love because if the only perfect love is going in there there's not going to be anybody over there with ill feelings or hard feelings or just that none of that gonna be over there all that is gone by the wayside I mean that's the way it is with the Christian holiday goes by the wayside nothing but that perfect love is what's going to be there and he said it'll take perfect love to put you in that place so how many wants perfect love the Lord help me give me that perfect love amen because that's what it's going to take amen for you not to miss it amen and so we're just so grateful to God that we can have it how many believes we're a privileged people hahaha folks we may be a small group but I can say this for the honest heart I believe that we are the most privileged in this whole Community everybody all around us we are more privileged than any church there is out there any people that's out there any anything we're more privileged than they've I don't care what it is I don't care if there's billionaires living around you are more privileged than the billionaires around you this Saturday at her amen because you are part of God you are God's child and you've heard from an angel that God sent I mean like I said you know you know Daniel and the different ones if there's an angel come boy we just really got you in the angel yes God send the angel the seventh Angels message isn't that right they had a message from God for us come out of her my people that you better not partake not ever sins that you receive not our planks get dressed in the righteousness of almighty God brought us back to the perfect word the perfectly Vindicated proven word showed us amen once again what Jesus Christ was like when he was walking on the shores of Galilee amen and we showed us once again what it was like when he all of those scribes the Pharisees caught this woman in the very Act of adultery and they had to throw some rocks in their hands he says now come on the law says that she he's caught she must die now what do you say isn't that right I mean you're going to either say yay or nay is that right there he was put on the spot oh don't get me started put God on the spot yeah that's gonna work out real well for you isn't it no no and he also yelled he had the perfect word didn't he that perfect God perfect Christ had a perfect word when he says you know he said he that is without sin cast the first stone and I'm here to tell you right now if there was ever a conviction to come down it was right then because there ain't one that flung The Stone they all went away isn't that right amen we want to talk a little bit maybe I'll have to charge the end about maturity on the sheath wave and so forth I'll I got to send a safe wave of of the first one says come to maturity but we had another example of that there in our generation when there was a young couple sitting on the front kissing and slapping on each other and practically making love in the church is that right real really lewd and terrible you know you don't do that he says go off basically you know somewhere else if you want to act like that but listen two or three times the Holy Spirit come down and says you say it's whatever to that young couple that you want and it'll happen now folks the same voice it says to speak to howdy right and whatever she asks for give it to her and that Holy Spirit to Hattie Wright said you know he's yeah God says you know what how do you ask whatever you want God will give it to you he just spoke to you you're poor if you want money this that or the other oh my but what did he say back to my point back to the point was is you know God trusted God knew his man amen now I got a quote here talk about that Chief wave after a while perhaps starts the end but he said the right word didn't he just like that just like Jesus says neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more he says I forgive you for that tell me that ain't like Christ amen amen praise the Lord slavers and rulers let me say first of all you're one or the other either a Slave are you a ruler you either rule or your slave now A Slave means servant so in a figure in one way or the other bam says we're all slaves you know even Jesus said I believe you read it Sunday he says the head of every man is Christ the head of every woman is the man and so forth and everybody there every there's a headship that goes on right one rules over the other amen and in order to rule you have to be ruled amen and Jesus even here gives Thrones to people places and places of rulership to people amen amen and we think about this because we are either a Slave a servant to something or where the master of it isn't that right let's turn again we're going to go through these scriptures if you will let's see what Jesus said about ruling in Matthew 25. amen tonight's service is not so much centered towards a sinner or whatever but it's more towards the person that's uh born again been placed in the kingdom of God and that it's been given a talent given something to do something with how many believes that now notice in Matthew 25 and we'll uh verse let's go with 14 25 and 14. for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his Goods hmm well can I just stop there a minute how many believes that all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into you so he delivered everything that Christ was all of them goods are now in you amen all right and then to the one he gave five talents and the two the other two and to the other one and every man according to his several ability and straight when he took his journey and he had he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them another five talents and likewise he that had received it too he also gained another two and he had receive one wind and dig the Earth and hit his Lord's money after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth unto them with them so he that had received five talents came and brought another five pounds saying Lord thou delivers unto me five talents behold I have gained besides them five more talents his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant now I mean those Billy Bam says maybe he wasn't there when he heard come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy and Laden but I want to be there when he says these words how many wants to be there when he says that that's what I want to hear well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord now notice he says thou uh well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make you ruler over many things can we just stop there and realize there's one thing that God don't give us a whole lot to do but you need to be faithful in the little things that God does give you to do because if you're faithful in a few little things that'll show that you'll be faithful in a whole lot and God can trust you with a whole lot so you got to be faithful in the little things amen so if you're faithful in Little Things the little things just a little bit he says I'll make you ruler over a lot and that's something I says ruler amen because how many knows let me just stop there for a minute well let me finish and I'll try to keep my thought over many things in and out into the joy of the Lord he also that had received two talents came and said Lord God delivers unto me two talents behold I have gained two other talents beside them his lord said unto him well I'm not good and faithful servant thou I have been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things how many believe that we're going to be ruler over many things if you're a faithful child of God you are going to rule and reign with Christ a thousand years how many knows it's very important to make good judgments make good judge good decisions Lord help us I hate making the wrong choices the wrong decisions don't you amen and of course we know the last one right so what for your last guy he went and hit and didn't do nothing with it huh and he was cast out isn't that right he was cast out because he knew nothing with what God gave him he's not going to rule over anything amen in other words if you're going to rule over there over a lot you're going to have to be able to rule over a little bit over here but you have to be a ruler I mean those we were made to be rulers amen now notice let's go to Genesis for just a second if you will Genesis 1 foreign 26 and God said let's make let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have go ahead Dominion all right over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created in him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have Dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so God had given man a Dominion brother bam says it this way in Genesis 1 26 when God made man he made him a god I mean those man was made to be a god not God but a god sons of God like God I am a true God that's right so he says because he because he gave him a Dominion he had rulership he had power over the birds of the air the cattle the winds the waves the fishes of the sea everything he had dominion over everything he was a ruler anointed a ruler because it was in the likeness in the image of God with an Earthly domain one place he says you know God made Adam to rule all the Earth and God ruled the heavens but man his son was made to rule the Earth rule amen like a king has Dominion rules Sons and Daughters were called to rule amen now notice he was anointed the ruler because he was made in the likeness in the image of God with an Earthly domain and that's why the Bible talks about how to do earth is waiting and crying and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the world is waiting for man to come back to his estate praise the Lord now I know there's another one now notice he was the first one that had the jurisdiction over everything in the earth is that right all the animals but he lost his power now notice I'm noticed that Adam when he fell he lost that sonship he lost his power he lost his authority because isn't that what the our rulers are they're in a position of authority laughs my thought that I kept off here a little bit ago I better say it before I forget it but you know there's some sins there's three major sins amen that spoke of the lust of the eyes unless the Flesh and lust of the eye this is of the world but there's another Power another uh there's another sin I want to talk to you about and that is the sin of Desiring uh uh of power people people want Power not not necessarily a sin but that's the other thing that people crave is power I mean you tell me why from what I understand brother not brother but Trump is a billionaire I don't know how many times over we talked about a billionaire you know they were making fun of his hair one time at this out of the other and this that or the other and this side or the other he says well only I can take I may look like a chipmunk or whatever if you want to call me but they don't have a billion dollars in the bank and it don't matter how critic because they were yeah well so I could yeah that's why we can't say much about that think about it now why would a man that has that want to go and do what he's trying to do sure I admire it because he wants to make America great again a lot of and especially the devil how many knows that's what the devil is Desiring he wanted a place of authority he went in a place of power he don't care about all this other stuff but some people are just hungry for evil power the devil the devil I want you to know that that was just uninterested he don't that's why he deceives the whole world he don't care he don't care that there's millions and billions of people worshiping him and don't even know it [Music] just as long as it were tipping him just as long as they're under his domain under his thumb doing what he wanted them to do and that's exactly what the devil tried to do in Matthew the first chapter with Jesus when he was up on the mountain he tries to get him to make this Stone into bread just do what I ask you to do or I'll give you all the kingdom I'll give you everything if you'll kneel down before me hey when the Devil Went big when it comes to getting him to worship him in the laid out of the meal down before him he says I'll give you everything if you'll just bow before me you can have it all that's how desperate the devil was for power that's how much he wanted Authority and that's how he wanted to rule he wanted to be greater than whatever this man was because he knew he was isn't that something I think my wife even said it you know he says you know the Devil he's a believer a lot of these people are so stupid they don't even believe in the devil but the Bible says the devil believes and trembles he knows there is a God he knows there's no question there for him but a lot of people know I don't know even the devil is himself God oh my but that's what he is and that's what some people hunger After People some people you know it's not about money it's not about women it's not about popularity but it's about Authority or it's about our that believe it just comes to my mind but that didn't that Jesus say that about the Pharisees he dropped the exercise authority over people that's right that's what the way the Pharisees were they want to get just loves to have the authority over people amen I believe it comes to mind didn't have it on the Note but nickelodeonism is that same way amen that uh priests and everybody I heard Donald said the other day he says oh dear Pentecostals they always says oh the Great big man of God all the great man of God all the great man of God why don't you cry try not but they tried to lift up minister so high but the congregation way down and I will bring them to you and y'all just you know come on folks but I like the way brother Donnie says no that's not the way it's supposed to be there's no big eyes and little U's and everything else amen praise the Lord I'm so glad aren't you glad tonight not to be a Slave yeah man Brother Band talked about the little Johnny Crow a man that was tied up for some time and somebody caught up Chronicle put him up on a I tied him up for so long and he went round and round around the farmer come along and I died and said go on and fly free isn't that right but that thing just kept walking around perfectly good Wings probably stop them once in a while just for the fun of it but I'm you know that's the way that way of the world is out there the people don't realize they're free they can be free truth is they're slaves let me know they're a Slave amen says you know Americans he says we don't claim to be idle worshipers but we're idle worship America is a bunch of idler worshiper they worship their their money to worship anything you put me for God is nothing but an idol to you and I remember that I want you to understand that we've become slaves to those things aren't careful you'll be a slave to it whatever you yield yourself to is whose servants you are Paul said Amen Let me believe that in Romans 5 I believe it's found in Romans 5 and verse 6 he says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it unless they're up neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness on the sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God now this is the phrase my my my punchline for sin shall not have minion over you oh how many sled the sin don't have to reign in your mortal body amen the Bible says the first Adam and he took us all into slavery he meant to be lost everything we lost our faith we lost our rights we lost life we lost everything but guess what amen Romans that says and the second Adam oh Verse 18 the same chapter of chapter five for us by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by righteousness this of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life and not the first item took us in this favoring but the second Adam set us free not only set us free but he purchased and get put us back in the right Sons and Daughters of God tonight I want you to understand that we are back in the position that Adam us before the fall just waiting for the body change how many believe that you're in that same position of authority oh well brother sister Sherry how about a scripture for it I like scriptures from preachers that say big things don't you well are you ready ask anything in my name and I will do it Give the Lord a hand [Applause] that's right the same way without him take to the birds speak to the storm speak to the dead speak to that whatever it is if you are back in the possession of even to ask God and nothing shall be impossible for you ask abundantly that you Joy may be full aren't you glad to be a son of God I'm glad to be a Son of God behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God he came into the world the world was made by him but the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him now but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name praise the Lord how many believe that when you believe on his name God gives you the power or authority or the rulership to become a son of God when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is time to rule We Rule our wives is that right a pastor a deacon the Bible says that they're supposed to have their own house in their order one that ruleth his own house well for if you don't rule his own house how can he rule the house of God hello we can't get a ship to sit down how in the world are we going to rule to the kingdom we can't control our tongue hello Bob was blessing James he says he that ruleth his tongue can rule the whole body if you can control this he says you can control it all right be to God oh we're going to get into some good stuff is that all right oh let's go all the way back to let me see Proverbs let's go to Proverbs I didn't put a sticker in there so I'm gonna have to look for that for just a second Psalms Proverbs the 16th chapter 16 and 32. and you know I think that I may not have corrected that because I wouldn't look for that and I didn't find it and I didn't correct it did I 16. no no I didn't correct it so you'll just have to take my word for it I can send it to you if you need me to but the Bible says that he that ruleth his spirit is mightier than he that taketh the city he had ruined his spirit is my idea that he that takes the city now how many knowledge that depends of course how big the city is but before you could take a city back then in the kind of City they had wall and everything else and everybody out you'd have to be a pretty tough guy to take us any but if you can rule your spirit now this is where we go into just a little bit different area coming down home basically and talking about ruling ourself huh that's right ruling or self let me let me just make a statement here a new I called it a new statement here I believe why uh new statement I I can't find it either so I think I remember it the statement is this that you live in the house of your greatest enemy your greatest enemy you're living in his house never mind because what is this flesh William Branham says that's my greatest enemy this flesh is your greatest enemy and where's your soul living right in here so that's right you're living in the house of your greatest standing me so guess what I mean you're gonna have a battle it's going to be a struggle we talk about it we talk about and I believe that it needs to be mentioned a lot because Paul said I have to die every day in other words you're going to have to fight that enemy every day you better keep him in check because how many knowledge that guy eats something else I want you to understand something people that are slaves to the devil amen there is absolutely no limit to them that's why they have completely went haywire that point completely lost there's no stopping of where they'll go because the devil doesn't have any boundaries he doesn't have any limitations does he look at the politics for instance when will it in that what we want to say when will it stop when will you all stop it already come on the man taking a women's sports unfair genetically a man had beaten him in a bike race beating them swimming beating the merrier and they're just quitting the win which is quitting I can't be the women's sports cause our leaders ain't got the praise to know that that's not fair they don't care if it's fair they just care if it's corrupt and perverted and stupid that's all they care about it corrupting it they're not fit to rule how many believes we will rule you one day how will we rule you I'll tell you I will rule you we'll be at the Throne of judgment the Saints shall judge the world and we'll cast them into the Lake of Fire that's exactly right now go do what I told you to do oh my think about how many knows the devil is just a bluff for the Christian he had no Authority has been stripped of his power strapped the Miss Authority really we don't need to give him any thou worthy of power he has no rights he used to be your servant he's to be your slave just like Samson Oh my he got into a lot of trouble didn't he amen you think about it all right we won't go into Samson but let's listen oh my now notice you know people want power and they don't really know what power is but the BAM says the way up is down if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from your old world and think and humble yourself before God amen and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a great lot of noise because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to God praise the Lord how you like that conquer yourself quench yourself to Christ how about yourself that's really power amen don't worry about ruling and reigning over there if you can't even control yourself and that's why we say a lot of time to people sometimes our kids go under its child control yourself I mean please have what we need to do but when our mind goes here our mind goes hey our feelings our emotions folks I want you to know you got to control your mind you got to control your your what comes what you think about because the Devil Wants to Rule in your mind he wants to rule in your heart but you and I had to cast him out is that right let the peace of God rule the Bible says in your hearts let the joy of the Lord be your strength amen oh my aren't you glad you'll have to get something hot God has called you to be a ruler even the wives that right you rule the house the kitchen the children everything around them the husband the head of the wife he used to rule the entire thing oh that's right in Christ most of all let's not leave us the important part Christ is to rule who the husband the man the head of the man is Christ is the one that's supposed to rule the husband hey praise the Lord aren't you glad but I thought man Lord Jesus help us the biggest enemy you have is by yourself we got the rule this thing first your affections your reasoning your conscience your memory your feelings imaginations I mean there's the world out there does not rule their affections and their emotions they let their flesh run rampant well you think Epstein them guys got put in jail and then hung and everything else and they had a lust problem and they had an island for sex and so forth amen and even the Hollywood stars you heard about that they got caught getting in enslaving girls for the purpose no control no checks focusing with me just bad if it wasn't for the rulership of the Holy Ghost in your life and in my life that brings checks and balances so to speak guards and to our feelings are you with me aren't you glad that he has dominion over us this one from God said if you've been able to conquer yourself because when you conquer something you'll rule over it you become the ruler of what you conquer Glory amen you love him that's why people are completely out of control the world is completely out of control because under Satan's rulership there is no control there is no limit we've seen in our politics now there is no limit Hey look the sensible thing to do would be to make all trans compete against trans isn't that right but they don't have that much sense let them compete against each other and they'd still be completed against the same genetics do you see why they're not no that's you see why we didn't even brother bam say it at one place or yeah he did he says you know man has never been able to control man has never been able to rule what no Kingdom has ever stood because under the rulership of Satan it always falls apart aren't you Glenn are you actually looking for a millennial reign a rulership where righteousness rules not perversion rules amen praise the Lord now notice so what is it what is it that gives us rumorship and control I'll just repeat the the the scripture of a canaan's first John there talks about he says now what is it that overcomes the world it says our faith is what overcomes the world that's what gives you the ability to rule even as John said he that believed on his name to them gave you the power to become son you can't do anything one place by the BAM says that Faith Masters come on folks all circumstances is that right it's Masters all circumstances in other words Masters becomes the master I mean those David was the master of the battlefield because of his faith Samson while he was in faith and not backflip he was the master of the battlefield can I say something tonight how about you are you the master of your Battlefield if you're living by faith if you're living by faith you'll Master whatever comes your way Billy Paul what is the great phenomenal thing about your dad the way he can control every circumstance huh put your name there what is so phenomenal about you how you can control every circumstance do we need to have an altar call tonight [Laughter] ah hello you see folks where we still needs a little growth that's right but look real genuine Faith Masters it now let's go on here what does it what is it now no what is the Conqueror conqueror and victory is the same to conquer means to beat down to override to handcuffed to go in remember Ephesians it says that we fight not against we fight not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness isn't that right so guess what if you overcome a ruler what are you doing that means you're a ruler in that right we rule the rulers whatever they're trying to rule over you when you rule over it you become the ruler you handcuff throw into prison it means that sin that once ruled you you rule it now there now down out that one it's ruled Faith rules now Joy poem has absolutely taken away the sorrow it rules now praise be to God I like that don't you it means that you have overcome every Church age God to him that overcomes will I glad to sit in other words to him that roots to him that has become a Son of God and he rules over his emotions affections his thoughts his mind his reasonings every part everything about you you're supposed to rule over because that's the first place of ruling before you're ready to rule your wife your children or anything else you need to rule this guy right here Lord help us Lord help me to rule over this guy every day because I live with him live with this enemy of Mind well we're standing man I'm in his house hahaha oh can I ask you a question well my goodness it's a battle going on which one wins that's exactly right the one that you feed the most when did you lead to the most you let that mind get away from you leave that this all the other get away from it pretty soon you're defeated isn't that right it got about us Lord help us amen that's why it's a daily path but I battle you have overcome you have whipped it you're greater greater says that it's in you then he that is in the world oh boy Lord help us I hope we're all there right now tonight I hope you're there that you can honestly say greater is he that is in me then discount that is in the world if you're not you're kind of defeated backslid or something happening right tripped up we do that sometimes but listen you want him to be greater in you than he that is in the world because then this house that's is under control amen oh who will deliver me from this body now what Paul said body of sin who is going to deliver me from it even Paul was looking for deliverance from it because no matter how much Holy Ghost you have no matter how saintly you are no matter how many storms you can stop brother bam still needed that cross to look at this flesh still had that carnal nature in it wouldn't it be nice let me change that phrase It's not wouldn't it be nice but won't it be nice when all that's taken care of that's when that body change comes and there won't be any desires anymore Brothers will be able to go and hug the sisters just as hard as they can Over Yonder there will be no sensation there will be nothing bad about it at all not right over here we have those glands over there there won't be a thought of it there won't be any of them glands over there I'm glad that one of these days even this is gonna get fixed praise the Lord anyway I thought Lord help us to rule in our houses in our families over our lives over our children over the church much is said about uh talking about those that have the rule over you and who have taught you the word of God and different things you know but you know in every aspect of our life doesn't matter who it is whether it's there's a pastor or whatever it is it's all under supposed to be under leadership and the rulership of almighty God now let me finish this here look greater than it oh I feel religious now he says praise the Lord listen and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is the victory again he says listen you who've been a drunkard and a slave to Whiskey you're the master over that now the devil of alcohol that made you drink you're the master of it now amen listen I don't mean non-belief I mean real Faith he's your servant then oh my you who can't lay tobacco down women and men he says when it comes to a place where you can't get to that spot he says who can't overcome it by faith he says get faith you'll Master it then I want to I want to read you a story yet a little woman that's sitting present now has been at this altar Time After Time After Time a good woman but she started smoking a long time ago and she just couldn't overcome it how many knows smoking brother bam says I'd rather see my wife drunk than smoking a cigarette this is probably why it's hard to overcome that nicotine devil man it hangs on like you would not believe hello it's a strong spirit cheeks just couldn't overcome it I would pray with her seemed like she just couldn't overcome it first thing you know I told her I said there'll be a danger down the road she says well brother Ben I have cried I have begged you see just emotional fighting the air that don't do any good I'd get down and pray with her lay hands on her she'd go back up in a few days and I'd meet her again just knock you down with Smiggle or cigarette smoke hands his fingers still hands still Brown then one night young down the under she went to a doctor begin to get sick wither away just a little spindly thing and a doctor looked into her and she said cancer smoking cigarettes there she was laying there to die and she got down the business and brother Robertson back there Mr Woods here and so forth sitting somewhere and I were down there hunting and I believed in somewhere in the truck and the Holy Spirit seemed to move us to Gold by the way up the knobs to where she was and when I got there she'd had a dream and when the Holy Spirit come into the room she got down to real business and she never smoked a cigarette from then on and she gained many pounds of weight and they can't find the trace of the cancer what is it it's faith that overcome why didn't overcome when I was praying for her here she was just messing around flooding around wasn't really serious about it how many believes if you're ever going to be the Overcomer you really want to rule you're gonna have to get serious about it when the doctor says you've got cancer you're gonna die she's got to she got the business that's the way it has to get when you get into business why wait that long brother Memphis when I get the business now put your faith in God what if that woman had her faith in me it had failed because I'm a man but when she changed her faith and I didn't Branham Tabernacle or in William Branham or anybody else but placed her faith in Jesus Christ she took then she got faith she raised above that the fears and the Thousand God healed her oh she overcame see because faith is the victory that overcomes overrides and rules overall hey man how many believe that because of the faith that we have can I take another five minutes to close you know in the Old Testament the Old Testament they used to have a harvest and they would get a Sheaf of wheat or whatever when they first come to come to come to harvest from what I understand they would take that Sheaf and they'd wave it to everybody say hey this wheat sheep has come to maturity isn't that something I had he'd have a glorious tradition but doing this and this wheat has come to maturity waved that she fall over another man talking about how did Jesus Christ was that Chief wave in his hour then when he come it showed that his son had come to maturity amen and that was waved over to people amen and Acts 2 and then showing that he was the first fruit of them that slept and so forth and it has risen again and they were waving that chief of Jesus Christ over the people the one that had come to Perfection amen amen as Christ was the first to raise from all the prophets and so forth let me listen he was the first of those who slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheep wave again in the last days remember it says I will restore all that diploma worm and all of us has taken in other words thy restoration of the Bright Tree God's going to restore back everything that we had lost we're going to go right back to that maturity again is that right notice there'll be a sheep wave wave waving up the Sheep what was it what was this sheath the first one to come to maturity the first one that proved that it was the wheat that proved it was a Sheaf Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time they will come forth for the Divide age or for a resurrection out of the dark denominationalism of Dark Ages will be a message that the fully mature word has turned back again in its full power and be waived over the People by the same signs and the same wonders amen that he did back then and amen and I had to sing you know he said the message and the messenger is always one they're the same and you talk about as a person that God could actually uh uh show that he was a mature son and give the power of the spoken word isn't that right so he could speak like Adam did he was the son that God he could speak to the storm God says just say what you want to happen this storm that's coming now right and he spoke to the winds just like Adam did isn't that something how God had him to do it and then God brought about him would tell us the story so same way as he went beyond the curtain of time he tell us what's over there told us the story you can believe it or you don't have to believe it brother I believe she told it for a reason I'm glad he told it I'm glad he didn't keep a secret because we needed to know that God could so trust him did and they could have called it another and a pirate thing or whatever and bring fear upon the church but even the hardest thing about the bull he spoke to an animal the animal kingdom showing amen that that somebody had come to maturity but how many Blues tonight that this wasn't just for the prophet of God he was perhaps the first fruit even one of the first to get there but we're trying to get there too aren't we we're going to come to the place where we've got ourselves surrendered to almighty God to where we speak and our word will be he says you know limbs will be restored and that's right all of this that happened it happened in his ministry it all happened there but I believe that it can happen in the bride's Ministry in our time in our day you need healing God will give you healing if you need rain for your crop I will send you rain God help us to come to maturity how many believes it's time for us to come to maturity because that was just the first fruits it was the Holy Ghost the perfect Vindicated Jesus Christ show just exactly like he was when he was here on Earth Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart even to a widow in the woman in Africa I believe who who had her meal or her food for three and a half years or so that kept on going and kept on coming and kept on coming almost every type of the Bible that Jesus did when he was here on Earth he did through his bodies his pride his church proving himself waving himself over the people saying look we've come through Luther he was just defeat he drank a little beer yet loser Wesley he wasn't perfect Pentecost wasn't perfect they thought that speaking in tongues and unknown tongues and interpretation now that's as close as it gets to God I'd like to differ with you but amen whenever the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he's the same yesterday today and forever but when they begin to discern the thoughts and intents of people's heart and tell you where you was at a certain time doing a certain thing what your name was and that Abraham says anybody I challenge anybody to come and show me any place that that was ever wrong never ever wrong if it had been brother Branham the man below that Pillar of Fire if he'd guessed it he says well I'd have a thousand one in a million maybe to guess it right any man that would guess it's something or just a he'd have a very slim chance but it was the pillar of fire above him that he waited for and he would talk how many knows and so many times brother bam says you know now he's using my voice to speak I don't understand but many times but bad he said I had to go back to the tape and see what I said yes it's the same man with the same voice that he talked to you on every day and and enduring the preaching word but let me tell you something there was a difference there was a difference whenever he took over and he began to turn the thoughts and tens of the heart I love it certain sister he told her address and everything and her friend came after service and said sister that was wrong you don't live there Jesus yes he was I moved here dead the other day it was exactly the right address God Don't Make Mistakes aren't you glad to have a chief wave like that waved over you so that you can know that hey where it's time it's time folks because somebody knows we're going to have to have a body change brother Brian I need I need Faith with my hand I need faith for different things that's coming on Amen we need faith and I need faith for a body change not just a hand or a toothache or this that or the other amen and I believe she's coming to maturity but let me say this as as your pastor make sure that you get this guy right here control rule this guy and all the rest will be fine God bless you stand with me if you will let's rule our house well amen our house everybody else's house we need to rule this house amen amen praise the Lord aren't you glad that every devil is under you all doubt is under you all Darkness every every Shadow of Doubt is gone because of the light the evening light that is coming proved itself real there's 1100 tapes of the Prophet the message that God brought and better bam says that those messages and those tapes will meet people on the Judgment Day when Luther preached what he preached that'll meet those group when Wesley preached that'll meet that group Pentecost what they've reached that's meet that group Paul preached irenius Martin all of them amen it'll meet him because it's all the Bible and it was preached and people either accepted her they rejected amen let's bow our heads while we search our hearts what is it that the Holy Spirit spoke to your heart tonight about yourself perhaps an area of your life that you need more rulership in see I I need to rule over this area I need to I need to have enough Faith to rule over every aspect of my life and there's still a couple areas that I really need God and I'm just going to raise my hand say God after tonight I pray Lord that you'll give me complete Victory help me to rule over this and rule over that that's given me trouble that's bothered me and it's kept me under and made me do things I don't want to do and and I hate do or whatever it might be and uh whatever it might be but Jesus you see the hands that are up Lord we all got to hand up Lord Jesus we ask God that you give us complete Authority and complete victory over every aspect of Our Lives Lord in our house that our house would be under control Lord Jesus and that we could rule our own houses well Lord father by the power of the Holy Ghost Lord and I ask God not just some areas but every area father whether it's our self whether it's our wives and our children our homes or our business God help us to be a real good ruler Lord and help us to be faithful I don't care Lord if we're poor if we're rich Lord whatever you've

you Lord Jesus so that we'd be good and Faithful Servants Lord Jesus that we'd be faithful in the few things that you've given us Lord Jesus for we know that your children Lord you according to your word Over Yonder will be given rulership according to how that we have ruled here so help us to rule father by your power and by your faith Lord we raise our hands and say God forgive us if we're
