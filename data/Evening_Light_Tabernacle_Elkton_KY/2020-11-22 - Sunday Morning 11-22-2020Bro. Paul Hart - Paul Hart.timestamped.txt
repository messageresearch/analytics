[34:23] course uh uh my children you know when
[34:26] they were about 10 or 11 years old they
[34:29] were able to go to the youth camp in in
[34:32] Ohio and that's where I uh well that's
[34:35] where I seen brother berer but we really
[34:38] didn't get acquainted a lot you know but
[34:40] only maybe through the altar calls maybe
[34:43] we both was there you know praying for
[34:44] the Youth and uh that there was a few
[34:47] times we spoke to each other and
[34:49] probably introduced ourselves and last
[34:51] time I saw him he was just there early
[34:53] summer brother dwie and also the church
[34:56] at the brother dy's there gives you
[34:59] their greetings
[35:01] amen amen uh for those that don't know
[35:04] me I'm brother Paul heart amen I have a
[35:08] a a different background uh when I was
[35:11] three years old uh of course my my
[35:13] father was a missionary in overseas in
[35:16] the
[35:16] Philippines and uh so we went there when
[35:19] I was about three years old I was born
[35:21] in maryan Indiana and I went there when
[35:24] I was three came back here when I was 16
[35:27] I didn't speak English till I was
[35:30] 14 so but uh anyway uh you know I didn't
[35:35] have a lot of schooling either I wasn't
[35:37] even able to finish sixth grade and uh
[35:40] because we just moved a lot and uh of
[35:42] course when you're a missionary you go
[35:44] where the Lord calls you and uh so I've
[35:47] had a an experience as a a young uh
[35:52] person a man from 3 to 16 and but there
[35:55] was several times we would come back
[35:57] here I believe I came back here when I
[35:59] was seven I came back here when I was
[36:01] about 10 or 11 I came back here when I
[36:03] was 14 and uh of course when I was about
[36:06] 14 we came here that was the longest we
[36:08] stayed here so I was able to interact
[36:12] with a lot of family members cousins and
[36:14] uh so then I began to pick up English
[36:18] and uh so when I went back to the
[36:19] Philippines they were like well brother
[36:21] Hart you can speak English now but uh of
[36:24] course uh one of the last year and a
[36:27] half that lived there we lived in a bagu
[36:29] city which is the Northern Area and they
[36:32] spoke English better than their National
[36:35] dialect so uh when I begin to learn
[36:38] better English they were happy because
[36:40] they didn't like it when I spoke in
[36:42] National dialect because they didn't you
[36:43] know they just spoke English better but
[36:46] anyway uh that's just that's mean and I
[36:49] I'm here and i' I've sure seen a lot
[36:51] when I was overseas I've seen uh a lot
[36:54] of things that you know that has
[36:55] happened uh for good and for bad and uh
[37:00] uh it's a poor country but the Lord was
[37:02] truly good amen and I've seen God move
[37:05] in people's lives and families and uh so
[37:09] you know there that's one thing that's
[37:11] good to have is an experience amen an
[37:13] experience with the Lord now that don't
[37:15] mean you got to go overseas to get an
[37:17] experience amen you just need a a closer
[37:20] walk with him a true relationship amen
[37:23] an intimate relationship with God Amen
[37:25] and let me tell you something you you
[37:27] you'll receive a lot of experiences amen
[37:30] and uh there's one thing that if you're
[37:32] true to him I believe God will be true
[37:33] to you amen and the Bible says he cannot
[37:36] lie amen God's not here to deceive us
[37:39] amen amen he's here to tell us the truth
[37:42] amen he tell he's here to tell us
[37:44] exactly how it is amen amen when he
[37:47] wants you to straighten up he'll tell
[37:49] you amen and when you're doing good he's
[37:51] going to tell you too amen but when
[37:53] you're doing bad you know he he's going
[37:55] to let you know that's just the way he
[37:57] is and I'm glad I'm serving a God that's
[37:59] that way amen he's not going to stray me
[38:02] anywhere that's going to cause me to you
[38:04] know I like it when he told when David
[38:06] cried out to God you know he said he was
[38:08] in a myy CL clay you know a myy Clay Pit
[38:13] amen you know brother berer asked me
[38:15] what's the title of my sermon I was like
[38:16] I can't give it to you because you know
[38:19] you might read you might have a thought
[38:20] but when you get up here the Lord could
[38:22] change that amen but as David cried out
[38:24] to God you know I don't know what David
[38:26] was going through amen but there he was
[38:28] Amen in in a Clay Pit he said he was an
[38:31] a myy clay amen I remember being in the
[38:33] Philippines when they buil a house they
[38:35] would dig a a hole amen about 6 eight
[38:38] feet deep and that's the septic tank
[38:40] amen but over there uh most of the
[38:42] places the the land there they have dirt
[38:45] that's called aupi which means clay you
[38:48] know and and uh but it has a a once once
[38:51] they dig about 8 ft then they reach that
[38:53] area there and then if you was to ever
[38:56] fall in that you cannot get out amen
[38:58] that the the walls of that that that
[39:01] that pit you know is is so slippery
[39:03] because of the clay if an animal was to
[39:05] fall in there and if they were in there
[39:07] for a day or two they die because of the
[39:09] gas the fumes and and all of that but
[39:11] here David's talking about so I know
[39:13] what he was talking about when he said a
[39:14] Clay Pit amen I know it's hard to get
[39:16] out but I like it when God responded to
[39:19] his cry amen he took him by the hand and
[39:21] placed him on the Rock amen glory to God
[39:24] God didn't just choose to place him
[39:26] anywhere where he'd fall again amen but
[39:28] he placed them amen on a Rock Amen which
[39:31] is Christ Jesus which is our foundation
[39:33] amen that's where we want to stand today
[39:36] amen when God does help amen he does
[39:39] truly help amen and I'm glad he put a
[39:41] song in our heart amen he put that song
[39:44] amen glory to God now God is truly good
[39:48] amen now uh if you don't mind I'd like
[39:51] to share a song If okay
[40:02] no I probably won't

[40:26] people are going through the Lord knows
[40:28] the thoughts he knows the hearts amen

[40:45] a Philippine book and I could read it
[40:47] but you give me an English book then you
[40:49] then I'm lost amen when I know when I
[40:52] came into the states
[40:54] and and when the Lord be to deal with my
[40:56] heart and trying to call me to do this
[40:59] and and I told the Lord I said Lord I

[41:06] don't have time to go back to school I
[41:08] said I can't take the time to find a
[41:10] tutor and that would teach me how to
[41:12] read or understand you know but I just
[41:15] had to pray and I said Lord if you're
[41:17] calling me to do this you have to teach
[41:18] me to read and the Lord taught me to
[41:21] read and then I said well Lord yeah
[41:25] maybe now I know how to read and I said
[41:26] but I don't want to just you know read
[41:29] words I said I want to understand it
[41:31] amen but I said I don't want to
[41:33] understand what I'm reading like like
[41:34] the world would understand it I said I
[41:36] don't want to misplace this word amen I
[41:39] don't want to misinterpret it or
[41:40] misplace it anywhere I said if I'm
[41:42] reading something I want the
[41:45] understanding amen I want to be able to
[41:47] present it that it's exactly the very
[41:49] thoughts of God Amen and then so I'm

[46:15] spirit to have the Liberty
[46:19] amen you know uh this flesh gets tired
[46:23] and it gets hungry and it gets weak amen
[46:26] but
[46:28] we know who is strong this morning amen
[46:31] God is truly the one that's in
[46:34] control and he is good to us amen and
[46:38] amen if you go to Psalms 33 in your
[46:43] Bible in chapter 10 and
[46:46] verse no chapter 33 verse 10 and verse
[46:53] 11 I'm still trying to get used to my
[46:55] glasses and
[46:57] uh I've only had them for about a few
[46:59] months and I guess uh you know when I
[47:02] was a whole lot younger and and you know
[47:05] I used to get these uh older men not old
[47:09] men but older than I am and they would
[47:11] come to me and they'd say brother Paul
[47:13] when you get to about our
[47:16] age he man you know and I've heard that
[47:19] many times like brother Hart when you
[47:20] get to be our age you're going to wake
[47:23] up in the morning and feel your bones
[47:25] cracking and your the aches that you
[47:27] know of course when they were telling me
[47:28] that I was like ah no way you know and
[47:31] when you get to be our age you know your
[47:33] eyes are going to get blurry and I said
[47:35] oh no no you know but anyway yeah well
[47:40] it catch up it'll you know it'll catch
[47:43] up with you and amen but we're trusting
[47:47] in the
[47:48] Lord so there in uh Psalms 33 verse 10
[47:53] and 11 it says the Lord bringeth the
[47:55] counsel of the heathen to
[47:58] nothing he maketh the devices it says of
[48:01] the people of none effect how many
[48:04] believes that the Council of the Lord
[48:06] standeth forever the thoughts of his
[48:09] heart to all generation and when you go
[48:13] to Proverbs
[48:16] 19 verse 21
[48:33] Proverbs 19 and verse
[48:35] 21 it says there are many
[48:39] device in a man's
[48:42] heart nevertheless the counsel of the
[48:44] Lord that shall stand amen you may be
[48:48] seated may the Lord add his Blessing on
[48:50] the rest of the reading of the
[48:52] word you know uh if I am to give a title
[48:56] to this we want to title it weapons that
[48:59] are
[49:01] formed weapons that are formed amen as
[49:04] we're looking at the Book of Proverbs
[49:07] amen and you know where it says there
[49:09] are many devices in a man's heart amen
[49:12] now you know normally when we think
[49:15] about weapons especially in the the
[49:17] scripture there in Isaiah 54 which we'll
[49:19] get there in a minute and uh of course
[49:22] in Proverbs it's talking about devices
[49:24] in a man's heart amen and it says but
[49:26] nevertheless the counsel of the Lord
[49:28] that shall stand amen but this device
[49:31] amen it means a thought amen it's a
[49:34] device thought it's a divine plan or
[49:36] purpose amen or even an invention so
[49:39] when you begin to look at Isaiah 54 and
[49:41] verse 17 which is a very familiar
[49:44] scripture and I believe it is a promise
[49:46] amen that we can stand on today amen and
[49:50] then as it reads no weapon that is
[49:52] formed amen now listen now no weapon
[49:56] that is formed against thee shall
[49:58] prosper amen and every tongue that shall
[50:01] rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[50:04] condemned amen Thou shalt condemn amen
[50:08] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[50:11] the Lord amen put your name there this
[50:13] morning amen this is the heritage of the
[50:17] Servants of the Lord amen and their
[50:20] righteousness is of me it says not ours
[50:23] but of his amen our righteousness is
[50:26] filthy drags in the sight of God Amen
[50:28] but we need his Spirit we need the Holy
[50:31] Ghost amen today more than ever and it
[50:34] says saith the Lord amen glory to God
[50:37] but there's one thing I want you to see
[50:39] in this verse though it's saying no
[50:41] weapon that is formed he says no weapon
[50:44] that is formed against thee shall
[50:47] prosper but the scripture is not saying
[50:50] that weapons are not formed amen the
[50:54] scripture is not telling you that weap
[50:56] are not forms at all because they are
[50:59] formed they are formed every minute
[51:01] every second amen every day amen that we
[51:04] live weapons are being formed and when
[51:07] we begin to look at this this uh uh this
[51:09] weapon here look as as as as Ty you know
[51:13] the definition here he says any tool or
[51:16] Implement for preparing a thing arms
[51:19] used in Warfare or weapons an instrument
[51:23] amen an instrument but here we know as
[51:26] we begin to look at weapons but we must
[51:28] come to when you begin to understand the
[51:31] verse it's not exactly just talking
[51:34] about a a rifle a knife amen or Cannon
[51:39] or or what technology has brought today
[51:42] that you know they use out in war amen
[51:44] that would take another life amen
[51:46] because let me tell you something your
[51:47] own car amen could be a weapon amen
[51:51] gasoline is a weapon but yes it's good
[51:54] it it it comes in handy and all of that
[51:56] but how we look at this weapon this
[51:58] morning because look the devil is so Sly
[52:01] he's so tricky amen and he will deceive
[52:04] you amen look and some weapons amen that
[52:07] he would place in your own hands e
[52:11] either it's spiritually or physically
[52:14] sometimes his tactic is not always so
[52:16] you can destroy your brothers and
[52:18] sisters but he'll place it in your own
[52:20] hands so you destroy your own
[52:24] self amen and sometimes when we are not
[52:26] close enough to God and we don't have
[52:29] this relationship with them it's hard
[52:30] for us to really discern the very
[52:33] weapons that the devil has put in our
[52:36] hands amen and here we're destroying
[52:38] ourselves and we don't even know
[52:41] it amen I mean God told them look you're
[52:46] wretched you're blind you're miserable
[52:47] amen you're naked and you don't even
[52:50] know it and Satan has put them in that
[52:54] place and they don't even know it amen
[52:57] and they're the one saying Lord we don't
[52:59] need you no more we have everything
[53:02] amen we have everything that we need of
[53:05] that's what it is but it's the very
[53:06] things what that the very Prince of this
[53:09] Earth has placed in their hands has
[53:12] given to them and they come to a place
[53:14] in their lives they get so relaxed and
[53:17] they get comfortable amen and they begin
[53:19] to just look at the things that they
[53:21] have my whatever it might be
[53:25] amen sometimes smarts and knowledge and
[53:29] you
[53:30] know well you don't think the devil
[53:32] would give you that yes he
[53:34] can
[53:36] amen H Allelujah but here we must be
[53:39] able to discern what the devil's doing
[53:41] especially in
[53:43] nowadays we can look at the church ages
[53:46] amen when you look into the Bible at the
[53:48] first church age you know the devil
[53:50] attacked them but he had a different
[53:52] tactic amen when he came to the second
[53:54] Church age he did something different
[53:57] amen cuz if he repeated amen what he did
[53:59] in the first church age it might not
[54:01] work in the second Church age they they
[54:03] they've already caught on to
[54:06] it so he's trying a different why it's a
[54:08] different year it's a different
[54:10] atmosphere different lifestyle Amen in
[54:12] the second church so he had to do
[54:13] something different and then the third
[54:17] and then the fourth and then the fifth
[54:18] and the sixth and can you imagine during
[54:20] the Dark Ages when they were tortured
[54:23] and I and this is this is the way the
[54:26] devil is
[54:28] amen but then when it came to the leodan
[54:31] church age brother gram says it the
[54:33] devil completely different
[54:36] there amen it wasn't like the first
[54:39] church AG second third fourth or fifth
[54:41] or sixth nothing like that at all
[54:43] brother brandom says the very things
[54:45] that the devil used was what he got us
[54:47] to where we were
[54:49] relaxed
[54:51] relaxed and he said and the richest
[54:56] complete different tactic
[54:59] amen amen and now he's trying to do Bo I
[55:01] tell you what this Corona virus the
[55:04] devil's just on a rampage and trying to
[55:06] close our church doors
[55:09] amen amen that's really that's exact why
[55:12] he's trying to do something different he
[55:14] says I'll get to them
[55:17] amen glory to God but I'm glad amen then
[55:20] one day brothers and sisters you won't
[55:21] even be able to walk with these in your
[55:23] hands anymore amen
[55:28] we'll have to meet
[55:31] secretly amen if that if that day comes
[55:34] amen glory to God I I believe it's right
[55:36] around the corner amen amen look I I'm
[55:39] not in the keeping times or or anything
[55:41] like that you know I believe I was given
[55:43] a sign amen I believe Jesus Christ died
[55:46] and was buried and was resurrected amen
[55:49] glory that's Calvary that's for me amen
[55:51] glory he's covered my sins amen
[55:54] hallelujah now he's what made way he's
[55:56] given me an opportunity amen now I
[55:59] believe there's an elect that's the
[56:01] bride cuz I believe there's those that's
[56:03] going to be in the city and then there's
[56:05] those that's going to be what outside
[56:07] the
[56:08] city amen where do you want to be where
[56:11] do you want to be in this city
[56:13] amen glory to God hallelujah you know
[56:20] the brother was just reading about the
[56:21] the 10 virgins amen oh they were all
[56:24] saved
[56:26] amen but only five was wise
[56:29] amen I I don't want to get into that
[56:31] amen I believe the Lord is has got us on
[56:33] a on a on a path here amen and but we
[56:36] just want to go with his leading amen
[56:39] and here this weapon here amen you know
[56:43] as it it's a tool or an Implement you
[56:47] know for preparing a thing arms used in
[56:49] Warfare weapons amen an instrument and
[56:52] then Paul says in Romans 6 in chapter uh
[56:54] chapter 6: 13 he says neither yield ye
[56:58] your members as what
[57:01] instruments and if we're not careful you

[58:40] little jealous amen it's like man I wish

[58:53] you'll start pursuing something that
[58:55] belongs to somebody else and it's not
[58:57] yours at all and you'll find yourself
[58:59] getting further away from God because
[59:01] you're so busy pursuing things
[59:05] am that's not meant for you but it's our
[59:09] skills and
[59:12] capability amen and bodies can can serve
[59:15] many purposes good or evil

[59:47] service amen who do we want to serve
[59:52] amen it is the one to whom we offer our
[59:57] service that makes the difference amen
[59:59] glory to God Amen so here in Romans 13
[1:00:03] Paul said here now in verse 12 and verse
[1:00:05] 13 He says the night is far spent isn't
[1:00:09] that
[1:00:10] true the night is far spent you know you
[1:00:16] know the Simplicity of this gospel the
[1:00:19] Simplicity of the word of God you know
[1:00:21] when you go to First Peter or second
[1:00:23] Peter I believe when Peter was getting
[1:00:26] the Saints ready amen for
[1:00:28] Rapture amen when he said the end of all
[1:00:33] times is at hand I mean this was way
[1:00:37] back when Peter you know and I believe
[1:00:40] Peter was here you know he didn't even
[1:00:42] have a chance to really preach to the
[1:00:44] people you know when he was mentioning
[1:00:46] this he had to write it in a letter and
[1:00:47] it had to be published and and passed
[1:00:51] out but there he still trying to use his
[1:00:54] hands his mind for the glory of God
[1:00:57] Amen yes and he was becoming to be a
[1:01:00] really old man he was dying amen and he
[1:01:02] was trying to get the people ready
[1:01:05] amen and then he was just only trying to
[1:01:08] get to them the Simplicity of this
[1:01:10] gospel and he told them about four
[1:01:12] things to get ready and he says to Be
[1:01:14] watchful to be
[1:01:16] sober and he said have what fervent
[1:01:19] charity and
[1:01:22] Hospitality four things simple things
[1:01:24] that he was trying to get to people Amen
[1:01:27] to adapt to to come to that place
[1:01:30] because Rapture was
[1:01:33] coming amen look I believe in deep
[1:01:36] things God is
[1:01:38] deep amen amen and when you spend time
[1:01:42] in the presence of God and you're really
[1:01:44] seeking God he'll show you things and
[1:01:47] that doesn't mean that what he shows you
[1:01:49] is something you can just run with it
[1:01:50] and just and then go to that person or
[1:01:52] this person and sometimes what he shows
[1:01:54] you it's just for you amen amen when you
[1:01:58] when you build a place Amen to where you
[1:02:00] can commune with God just you and him
[1:02:02] look I have I have studied things and
[1:02:05] printed it out brother berer but it's
[1:02:07] just put up Tuck and I'm like I've asked
[1:02:09] the Lord Lord how's come you won't let
[1:02:11] me preach
[1:02:13] this and you know what I get he said
[1:02:16] well no that's that's yours and
[1:02:19] mine see that's that's when you were
[1:02:21] alone with me he said that's what I gave
[1:02:23] you
[1:02:25] amen and we all should have that a time
[1:02:28] that special time just you and God alone
[1:02:31] as you communicate with them look he's
[1:02:33] going to open up to you and it's just
[1:02:35] for
[1:02:37] you and then if you try to present it to
[1:02:40] somebody else it they
[1:02:44] gooo and it's nothing
[1:02:47] deep
[1:02:50] amen but you need to cherish those
[1:02:52] things
[1:02:53] amen hang on to them
[1:02:56] those are the things that God has given
[1:02:58] you that way when the Devil comes to
[1:03:00] attack you amen you've got something
[1:03:02] amen glory to
[1:03:04] God Amen Hallelujah you got something to
[1:03:07] point back at him and say look it is
[1:03:09] written it's a promise unto me amen
[1:03:14] glory this is my inheritance
[1:03:19] amen he says
[1:03:23] now chapter 13 of Romans verse 12 the
[1:03:26] night is far spent the day is at hand
[1:03:28] amen you believe that the day is at hand
[1:03:31] the night is far spent let us therefore
[1:03:34] cast off the works of darkness and let
[1:03:36] us put on the armor of light amen glory
[1:03:41] and we need that armor of light amen
[1:03:44] look when you begin to study the light
[1:03:46] and the SC the scriptures you begin to
[1:03:48] look at different aspects of light amen
[1:03:50] or different categories amen look I'm
[1:03:53] not good with words but I know the Lord
[1:03:56] will help us Amen to understand what
[1:03:58] he's trying to get to us look when John
[1:04:00] the Baptist came yes he was pointing to
[1:04:02] the light amen he was pointing to the
[1:04:05] light there's the light right there amen
[1:04:08] that his his shoelaces I'm not even
[1:04:10] worthy to untie or to even tie or
[1:04:12] whatever
[1:04:14] amen he pointed he was there he was what
[1:04:17] the prophet crying in the wilderness
[1:04:20] amen who was that Wilderness that was
[1:04:24] Israel and he's called crying out to
[1:04:26] them and he's preparing the way amen of
[1:04:29] the lord and there he pointed he says
[1:04:31] there's the light and when they begin to
[1:04:33] crushing him he says no I'm not the
[1:04:36] light he says no I'm not the
[1:04:40] Messiah I'm just the prophet I'm just
[1:04:42] the one crying in the
[1:04:45] wilderness amen there he is crying to
[1:04:48] Wilderness Amen to Israel and telling
[1:04:50] them here's your Messiah here's the
[1:04:52] light
[1:04:54] amen but as he pointed to the light that
[1:04:57] was the
[1:05:00] light amen
[1:05:02] glory but when Jesus finally came then
[1:05:05] he could be the light that could shine
[1:05:08] on all
[1:05:09] men and when Jesus here was on Earth
[1:05:12] amen there he is the light above light
[1:05:16] can shine on things look you can have
[1:05:18] you can shut all the lights off in here
[1:05:20] and and barricade all the windows
[1:05:23] windows where there's no light coming
[1:05:24] and it's just
[1:05:26] black amen all these pews will be here
[1:05:29] and like and you may never be able to
[1:05:31] see the
[1:05:32] dust but that doesn't mean that dust is
[1:05:35] not on
[1:05:37] there
[1:05:39] amen you make it Pitch Black in here
[1:05:41] they that dust will still be on there
[1:05:43] but you can't see it and that's exactly
[1:05:45] it was amen that's the way it was those
[1:05:48] men those people amen the dust was on
[1:05:51] them but they couldn't see berer it was
[1:05:54] dark amen and but here's Elijah pointing
[1:05:58] and preparing the way for the light to
[1:06:00] come so it can shine on them now they
[1:06:03] could see the
[1:06:04] dust now they could see the dust amen
[1:06:07] they can like my look at me I'm a sinner
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:13] glory they saw their mistakes they saw
[1:06:16] their their wrongs and amen glory
[1:06:19] something begin to work inside the light
[1:06:22] Shin amen glory
[1:06:27] glory to God but
[1:06:30] look but I don't want the light to just
[1:06:32] shine on the
[1:06:34] outside amen the Bible says we are the
[1:06:37] light of this world but of course Jesus
[1:06:40] also said he says as long as I'm what in
[1:06:43] this world I'll be the light of the
[1:06:46] world Amen but who will be Jesus
[1:06:49] today I hope there's a group of people
[1:06:52] here amen can say I'll be Jesus today
[1:06:55] amen I'll be that word being made flesh
[1:06:57] continually amen I want to be the light
[1:07:00] amen that's shining among on Amen that
[1:07:02] gives them the opportunity to say look
[1:07:04] am I I need Grace I need
[1:07:08] Mercy I hope we can get people to want
[1:07:11] the light now to flow in
[1:07:14] them amen glory to God but the light
[1:07:18] from the outside amen we can see amen
[1:07:20] 120 in the upper room amen they want a
[1:07:23] light shining on them anymore it was a
[1:07:25] light shining through
[1:07:27] them that's what we want today Amen Let
[1:07:30] our lives amen project amen the very
[1:07:33] life the very characteristics of God
[1:07:35] Amen don't never let this devil get an
[1:07:39] Open Door Amen to where he would use you
[1:07:41] for whatever weapon he thinks that he
[1:07:43] might use toward your brother or your
[1:07:45] sisters amen or whoever it may
[1:07:49] be Lord I want these members Amen to be
[1:07:52] used for your service amen
[1:07:55] and sometimes we need patience sometimes
[1:07:58] God prepares you and sets you to the
[1:08:00] side
[1:08:02] amen just have
[1:08:04] patience when that time comes he'll use
[1:08:07] you amen but be
[1:08:10] ready amen glory that's right verse 13
[1:08:14] it says let us walk honestly as in the
[1:08:17] day not in rioting and drunkenness amen
[1:08:21] not in chambering and wanness also
[1:08:24] wanness look We're All In the Flesh we
[1:08:27] always want this and want that amen amen
[1:08:31] you you have a nice home but when your
[1:08:33] neighbor starts remodeling when your
[1:08:34] neighbor starts to add on their home you
[1:08:36] want to add on your home amen he gets a
[1:08:38] new lawnmower you want a new lawnmower
[1:08:40] amen he gets a new car whatever it is I
[1:08:43] didn't you want to get a new car amen
[1:08:45] it's just a human thing amen want want
[1:08:48] want want
[1:08:51] Amen Let Us walk honestly amen as in the
[1:08:54] days not in ranting and drunkenness amen
[1:08:57] not in chambering not in wantonness not
[1:09:00] in strive and envying amen glory I don't
[1:09:03] even think that this is the time of of
[1:09:05] of you know acting like
[1:09:08] that we want really Lord to the Lord to
[1:09:11] really deeply amen really dwell in us
[1:09:14] and look the Bible talks about when God
[1:09:18] said you know I have chosen you unto
[1:09:20] what
[1:09:22] salvation amen
[1:09:27] amen who are
[1:09:29] we you
[1:09:31] know to look at others and and because
[1:09:35] you done something wrong and whenever
[1:09:37] judgment comes on you and then we like
[1:09:39] well you deserved
[1:09:42] it amen I believe we need a change of
[1:09:45] attitude like
[1:09:47] Jonah when Jonah was called the Nineveh
[1:09:50] look there was something about Nineveh
[1:09:52] that not only Jun Jun Jonah was not the
[1:09:55] only only one that hated
[1:09:58] Nineveh amen that Syrian people over
[1:10:02] there they were Wicked they were warlike
[1:10:04] people they were going to be the next
[1:10:07] Empire
[1:10:09] amen and they were so wicked the
[1:10:12] killings was going on and how they
[1:10:14] deceived the people look Jonah don't
[1:10:16] tell you about Nineveh in details so
[1:10:20] maybe just to give you some homework
[1:10:22] readed nahem
[1:10:26] read the book of nahem and nahem will
[1:10:27] tell you exactly what Nineveh was all
[1:10:31] about then you'll understand why Jonah
[1:10:34] had such a hatred for the
[1:10:36] people that when God called
[1:10:39] Jonah because I believe he needed an
[1:10:41] attitude change brother berer and God
[1:10:43] already knew that God knows you're from
[1:10:45] beginning to the end and he goes I'm GNA
[1:10:47] I'm going to use Jonah I'm going to send
[1:10:49] him over there I'll change his attitude
[1:10:53] yes he will there was a time when Jonah
[1:10:55] be to talk to God and there he was on
[1:10:57] his way you know and and he said did I
[1:10:59] not talk to he says I even told you to
[1:11:02] goad he said didn't I beseech you to
[1:11:03] even take my own
[1:11:05] life than for me to go over there Jonah
[1:11:09] was willing for God to just go ahead and
[1:11:11] kill him destroy him in his life than
[1:11:14] for him to go over there because Jonah
[1:11:16] didn't feel like Nineveh deserved God's
[1:11:21] mercy he didn't think Beneva deserved
[1:11:25] God God's love or forgiveness or any of
[1:11:27] that what they're doing over there
[1:11:29] they're so evil and wicked amen it's the
[1:11:33] same
[1:11:34] today and when you begin to to to read
[1:11:37] what nahem talks about Nineveh you'll be
[1:11:40] able to see the day you're living
[1:11:43] in how they scam people and how they
[1:11:46] deceive people and how they're killing
[1:11:48] each
[1:11:52] other and how they they uh uh present
[1:11:55] their their beauty and Prestige Amen to
[1:11:59] deceive people to get people to relax
[1:12:02] and and and you know get comfortable
[1:12:04] around then when you're all relaxed and
[1:12:06] comfortable and then they slit your
[1:12:11] throat look that's the way the devil
[1:12:13] works and that same spirit that was on
[1:12:16] Nineveh those people those Syrian amen
[1:12:19] and that's the whole reason why Jonah
[1:12:20] was like I don't want to go he had such
[1:12:23] hatred in him amen
[1:12:27] but God is so good amen he you there
[1:12:29] Jonah didn't even know it and while he
[1:12:31] was on the boat amen that he was doing
[1:12:33] missionary
[1:12:35] work the whole crew was
[1:12:39] saved and they were pagan people they
[1:12:42] were superstitious
[1:12:44] people those men on that boat amen but
[1:12:47] by one one miracle that God had perform
[1:12:50] performed amen where he had calmed the
[1:12:53] sea and they were at awe
[1:12:55] how awesome is this and they made a vow
[1:12:58] to God they made a promise and they made
[1:13:00] a sacrifice and they worshiped
[1:13:04] God look and they were pagan people and
[1:13:07] they were more concerned about Jonah's
[1:13:09] life so they tried real hard to get that
[1:13:12] boat to the to the shore to save Jonah's
[1:13:16] life because Jonah told him what to do
[1:13:18] he says if you just throw me over all of
[1:13:20] this will be over and he says huh says
[1:13:22] we'll save you we'll try to get and
[1:13:24] there they are yeah they were
[1:13:28] Sinners they were more they were
[1:13:30] concerned for his life and Jonah at that
[1:13:32] time he was really concerned for their
[1:13:34] life too but still deep inside he had
[1:13:37] such hatred for Nineveh that still won't
[1:13:40] work with
[1:13:42] God it's got to be Pure Clean amen
[1:13:47] because I believe God is coming back for
[1:13:49] a people that is pure spotless and clean
[1:13:52] amen glory
[1:13:56] amen glory to God I don't know why I'm
[1:13:59] getting on the these are not even on my
[1:14:00] notes amen glory but God is good amen I
[1:14:03] believe he's talking to somebody look if
[1:14:05] he ain't talking to you I can hear
[1:14:07] myself amen I've got ears
[1:14:12] amen maybe he ain't stepping on any of
[1:14:14] your toes but I've got tens he's
[1:14:16] stepping
[1:14:17] on
[1:14:20] glory
[1:14:22] Lord but that's exactly how Jonah
[1:14:28] felt but he also knew his
[1:14:31] God he also knew that when he got there
[1:14:33] and preached this the you know what he
[1:14:35] had to preach give the people the
[1:14:37] message he he knew they would repent and
[1:14:39] he knew God would would would would
[1:14:41] forgive
[1:14:43] them
[1:14:45] right you imagine this can you imagine
[1:14:48] Jonah being in the fish for for three
[1:14:50] days well I tell you what my heart would
[1:14:53] and and and within an hour it' be
[1:14:56] gone I'd be so scared there'd be no
[1:14:59] light it' be dark you don't know what's
[1:15:01] going on in that belly
[1:15:03] amen he was there three days three
[1:15:06] nights three days man that's a long time
[1:15:09] I wonder how it really felt he probably
[1:15:11] I don't know if he was marking the days
[1:15:13] but it probably felt weeks to
[1:15:17] him but yeah he prayed the
[1:15:19] god Bible said he did I don't even know
[1:15:23] how he knew where East was
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:28] amen but my but when the fish finally
[1:15:32] spit him out do you think he was eagerly
[1:15:35] uh you know so happy says W I'm ready to
[1:15:37] go to n now and
[1:15:41] preach he grudgingly
[1:15:47] went amen he grudgingly
[1:15:50] went but he
[1:15:52] went amen
[1:15:55] Glory you know the story you know some
[1:15:58] of you went to the Sunday school but you
[1:16:00] probably say brother har I didn't hear
[1:16:01] it like that I only heard he was thrown
[1:16:04] out the boat and the fish swallowed him
[1:16:05] and spit him out in three days and there
[1:16:07] he was preached and people repented and
[1:16:10] the Lord saved them amen but see God
[1:16:14] says I've chosen you unto salvation so
[1:16:16] what he's given every man or woman on
[1:16:18] the face of their what a
[1:16:23] responsibility but he's given them an
[1:16:25] opportunity with responsibility to make
[1:16:28] a
[1:16:29] choice amen
[1:16:33] glory so who are we to say oh you
[1:16:36] deserve it look if this Corona virus is
[1:16:39] some judgment that's hidden but look
[1:16:41] judgment is coming you can't stop that
[1:16:45] amen amen glory to God look it's it's a
[1:16:48] divine plan of
[1:16:51] God Amen but you know when we're looking
[1:16:54] at divine power in the Bible the Bible
[1:16:56] says he shared that with you divine
[1:16:59] power he shared that with you his very
[1:17:02] divine nature and divine power he's
[1:17:04] given that to
[1:17:07] you and if it's divine
[1:17:11] wow excuse me who can stop
[1:17:15] him who can stop divine
[1:17:20] power no demon on Earth amen and I don't
[1:17:24] care what kind of weapon the devil can
[1:17:26] form which is being formed every
[1:17:29] day that he will never amen be able to
[1:17:33] stop divine power
[1:17:36] amen that is the very plans of God what
[1:17:39] God has planned for you no demon no
[1:17:42] devil can come to you or who he may use
[1:17:44] amen with whatever kind of weapon he'll
[1:17:47] never be able to stop you because that's
[1:17:49] the very divine power of God
[1:17:55] amen glory to God look when we're just
[1:17:57] looking at simple things in the Bible
[1:17:59] you know the story in what 2 Chronicles
[1:18:02] amen when uh uh Moab and uh and all
[1:18:05] those you know those people that and you
[1:18:07] know who they were that was across the
[1:18:09] Dead Sea that was about to attack you
[1:18:11] know Babylon I mean um Israel there was
[1:18:15] Jehoshaphat
[1:18:16] amen amen when it came to him and he
[1:18:19] said hey we saw a group of army a lot of
[1:18:22] people over there and they they they're
[1:18:25] just right now across the Dead Sea
[1:18:28] amen you know who they were they were
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:32] syrians the same people out of
[1:18:37] Nineveh going there in Chronicles there
[1:18:40] going there and they had just built the
[1:18:44] temple they had just built the temple
[1:18:47] amen and they just had amen there uh
[1:18:50] where they had the the ceremony
[1:18:55] and you can read there and when Solomon
[1:18:59] prayed and what they said that that
[1:19:01] prayer was the longest prayer it was
[1:19:03] chapter 12 to chapter 40
[1:19:07] something they said it's the longest
[1:19:09] prayer ever prayed that was recorded in
[1:19:11] the
[1:19:13] Bible but when you begin to study the
[1:19:15] prayer it was so unique brother
[1:19:18] Tyler it was a ceremony
[1:19:21] prayer but it was a prayer where God was
[1:19:24] given the
[1:19:26] recognition
[1:19:28] amen and then when it come to where
[1:19:31] here's jehas josaphat called all the
[1:19:34] people there they are even Judah had to
[1:19:37] bring what the women and the children
[1:19:39] and they gathered there and Jehoshaphat
[1:19:42] started calling for where let's pray
[1:19:44] let's get together and let's
[1:19:46] fast we're about to get destroyed by the
[1:19:49] syrians
[1:19:53] amen so let's let's look at weapons that
[1:19:56] the devil would use on what kind of
[1:19:59] weapon God would
[1:20:02] use
[1:20:03] amen so there the
[1:20:08] story here they they're scared they're
[1:20:10] just like you and
[1:20:13] I well what are we going to
[1:20:15] do oh I'm sure when they heard of this
[1:20:18] probably some of the men was sharpening
[1:20:20] their
[1:20:21] swords maybe some of them that was good
[1:20:23] with the archery started making arrows
[1:20:25] or trying to check how many you know
[1:20:27] inventory
[1:20:31] and maybe the strong men maybe no skills
[1:20:35] and weapons or whatsoever but I'll pick
[1:20:38] up a rock maybe just some uh some kind
[1:20:41] of farm instrument or something
[1:20:46] amen but they knew someone was coming to
[1:20:49] destroy them they were there they were
[1:20:50] going to destroy and kill and take over
[1:20:53] and destroy that to Temple amen why is
[1:20:55] it that when God has built something the
[1:20:58] devil wants to come and destroy
[1:21:00] something amen every time God has
[1:21:02] blessed you amen the Devil Comes the
[1:21:04] next day and want to destroy wants to
[1:21:06] steal
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:08] it amen here's something that God has
[1:21:12] ordained them to do amen that Temple was
[1:21:16] a symbol of where they could gather
[1:21:19] together amen and be under the presence
[1:21:22] of God
[1:21:23] amen amen I'm glad I can be under the
[1:21:25] presence of God no matter where I'm but
[1:21:28] see they had a temple to go to amen but
[1:21:31] I'm glad this is the temple now amen
[1:21:34] you're the temple now amen
[1:21:38] Glory Hallelujah and here now they're
[1:21:42] gathered they're
[1:21:44] praying amen but when you look at the
[1:21:47] prayer they're they they give the
[1:21:50] recognition to God they gave him to uh
[1:21:54] they they begin to remind God of his
[1:21:57] past things that he's done wonderful
[1:21:59] things that he's
[1:22:01] done amen when he delivered them out of
[1:22:05] Egypt and then through the Journey in
[1:22:07] the wilderness how God was good they
[1:22:09] begin to remind God that's right they
[1:22:13] gave him his the recognition amen that's
[1:22:16] right and Assa Assa in the same in the
[1:22:20] same story when Assa prayed to God the
[1:22:22] king Assa it was so short
[1:22:25] but it went right to the
[1:22:27] point but even in that prayer he was
[1:22:30] asking for help but he still gave God
[1:22:36] recognition and then here in the story
[1:22:38] now here they are finally God speaks and
[1:22:43] he speaks through
[1:22:45] jesel amen through a
[1:22:48] prophecy and told him go on he says go
[1:22:52] over there to a certain place amen and
[1:22:54] you'll come to a cliff he said and
[1:22:56] you'll see them out in the wilderness
[1:22:58] you'll see them the Syrian will be over
[1:23:00] there and he says go and I'll be with
[1:23:05] you I'll be with you amen but when you
[1:23:08] begin to read the story you don't have
[1:23:12] it where here Jehoshaphat you know he
[1:23:14] says in the morning because it says
[1:23:17] tomorrow tomorrow that's all they had 24
[1:23:22] hours they didn't have weeks months to
[1:23:26] prepare they didn't they didn't have
[1:23:27] time to train
[1:23:29] anybody I don't even know if that's
[1:23:31] enough time to to lay out a blueprint
[1:23:34] and say now your archers go over here
[1:23:36] and your swordsman's here you know we'll
[1:23:38] plank them over here and you know we'll
[1:23:40] cut them off here and you know they
[1:23:42] didn't have time to sit around and make
[1:23:44] plans amen they were praying to God Amen
[1:23:47] letting God know who he really is amen
[1:23:51] and they were relying on him trusting
[1:23:53] who he was amen
[1:23:56] Glory this was the people that was about
[1:24:00] to be
[1:24:01] destroyed take whatever they had their
[1:24:04] livelihoods amen they were going to be
[1:24:07] some probably killed and some captive
[1:24:09] amen that's right yeah and now so they
[1:24:14] they prayed they got an answer from God
[1:24:17] so
[1:24:19] here it's morning
[1:24:22] time and you know when you begin to read
[1:24:25] the story they didn't start worshiping
[1:24:27] and this and that like like they didn't
[1:24:30] pray like in such a way where my you
[1:24:32] know we're going to war and it wasn't
[1:24:34] like that at
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:37] all you their attitude was if in the
[1:24:40] morning and you know when they prepared

[1:25:12] to carry a sword a bow a staff or any
[1:25:16] Shield or whatever it is they could
[1:25:17] think of Amen as a natural weapon to to
[1:25:20] fight the syrians amen
[1:25:25] so here the morning comes brother berer
[1:25:27] and here's Jehoshaphat he begin to talk
[1:25:30] to the people begin to encourage them

[1:26:40] standing on the Rock they were standing
[1:26:42] on Christ amen glory they were standing

[1:28:18] a piece of paper down and gather his men
[1:28:21] and he could make a plan and it
[1:28:25] worked amen he was good at it and God
[1:28:28] was on his side and he never left God
[1:28:32] amen amen when when things were going
[1:28:35] wrong amen that's when Joshua say
[1:28:38] there's something wrong this is not the
[1:28:40] promise God gave me amen there's
[1:28:43] something wrong amen glory and when
[1:28:46] something's going wrong maybe you need
[1:28:48] to examine
[1:28:49] a amen you need to examine yourself
[1:28:52] because like look this is not the
[1:28:54] promise that God gave
[1:28:56] me I i' I've strayed somewhere I got off
[1:29:01] somewhere amen but look but here Joshua
[1:29:05] knew how to when they when they
[1:29:06] conquered land they conquered land amen
[1:29:08] and they got it amen but when it came
[1:29:10] when it came to Jericho it was a
[1:29:13] complete different War right amen and
[1:29:18] here there they are they're facing
[1:29:21] Jericho amen the the tallest walls there
[1:29:25] is the thickness of it Giants in the
[1:29:29] land amen and you only had you only had
[1:29:33] Joshua and Caleb that was willing to
[1:29:38] go hey man can you imagine and because
[1:29:40] of all of that and you know I just I
[1:29:43] asked the person I said you know in the
[1:29:45] Bible you know when when those men those
[1:29:49] 10 tribes that
[1:29:51] wouldn't wouldn't believe amen and and
[1:29:54] they got the people to be discouraged
[1:29:55] and got them to doubting amen and and
[1:29:58] the Lord you know put 40 more years on
[1:30:02] them so I I asked I asked I said hey do
[1:30:06] you think we want 40 more
[1:30:09] years of what's going on today do you
[1:30:11] want 40 more years of this I was like I
[1:30:14] hope I know I said I know the Bible says
[1:30:16] he's the Lord he's God he changed not
[1:30:19] he's Jesus Christ that man is the same
[1:30:21] yesterday today and forever I said I
[1:30:23] hope he ain't giv us another 40
[1:30:29] years look there's there's enough
[1:30:32] unbelief that if he wanted to do that
[1:30:36] but look I'm ready to go home amen Noah
[1:30:40] was only given 120 years to preach the
[1:30:42] gospel look I'm not in the times but
[1:30:44] they say Le thean Church a started in
[1:30:48] 1906 this is what
[1:30:51] 2020 that's 14 years I mean 114
[1:30:57] years my but let me tell you something
[1:30:59] if we only do have six years left that's
[1:31:02] not a long
[1:31:05] time six years can slip just like that
[1:31:09] you know I thought when we when my wife
[1:31:11] and I had children I didn't think I'd
[1:31:13] see them going to school I said uhuh
[1:31:15] rapture's coming we'll never have to put
[1:31:17] up with our kids ever going to school or
[1:31:19] public or have to deal with you know
[1:31:21] those things the pressure
[1:31:24] Y no then the day come when we had to
[1:31:27] walk into the school bus and oh our
[1:31:29] children going to school said well we'll
[1:31:32] probably never see them graduate
[1:31:36] well my youngest is 22 my oldest is
[1:31:43] 26 I said well we'll probably never see
[1:31:45] them
[1:31:47] married but every time I say something
[1:31:50] like that we always get to that place
[1:31:54] amen but but we can look back as when we
[1:31:58] just saw them born and and hold them in
[1:32:00] our arm like it was just
[1:32:03] yesterday can you imagine six years if
[1:32:05] that's all we got left look I'm not
[1:32:07] starting a Doctrine okay don't run with
[1:32:09] this amen I'm just but I I hope we're
[1:32:13] all got something within us that we're
[1:32:15] ready to go amen and Lord if I if that
[1:32:18] is look it could be
[1:32:20] today that's right that's right amen
[1:32:23] that's the way that's how our attitude
[1:32:25] should be it's today it's any
[1:32:29] minute amen glory to God you don't know
[1:32:32] when your time is also you could leave
[1:32:35] this church and you don't never
[1:32:39] know amen but here look get back to John
[1:32:42] here there he's facing Jericho amen and
[1:32:45] then when he begins to talk to God about
[1:32:48] how are we going to defeat this amen it
[1:32:50] was finally
[1:32:52] time 40 years had passed it was finally
[1:32:57] time 40 years Joshua had ways to to sit
[1:33:01] and thinking how to how to do
[1:33:04] this but when that time
[1:33:07] came talk
[1:33:09] about
[1:33:11] it it just blew his
[1:33:14] mind when God began to talk to him on
[1:33:17] how they were going to do it he says
[1:33:18] you're just going to
[1:33:20] March and you're just going to make a
[1:33:22] loud noise' and you're just going to
[1:33:24] blow the trumpets and you're just going
[1:33:26] to shout and sing and you
[1:33:29] know and then he said you're going to
[1:33:32] put the
[1:33:33] priests he says you're going to put the
[1:33:35] priests the priests and the Levites in
[1:33:38] front my can you imagine Joshua like all
[1:33:42] the years that he's conquered land and
[1:33:44] defeated them that where they went out
[1:33:46] to war or to fight those with swords and
[1:33:49] Spears and Bows sweat blood amen
[1:33:54] when it come to this time it was
[1:33:56] completely
[1:33:58] different
[1:34:00] amen says you're going to go at it just
[1:34:03] just making a loud noise blow that
[1:34:06] trumpet and you're going to place the
[1:34:07] priest and the Levites in the front and
[1:34:09] he's thinking this is odd why not the
[1:34:12] archers and the the Swordsmen and the
[1:34:14] spearmen those that were strong will put
[1:34:17] them in the front that's exactly how he
[1:34:19] would have done
[1:34:21] it right but now he's told not this
[1:34:27] time
[1:34:28] amen look God had to take them away from
[1:34:32] those things amen so they could come to
[1:34:34] a place that when it came to this to
[1:34:37] this battle they truly had to rely on
[1:34:41] God not on their self abilities amen
[1:34:44] glory to God not their their their own
[1:34:48] ideas of what weapons are Amen to fight
[1:34:50] a
[1:34:51] war amen it's same way with
[1:34:54] you're going to fight him just go sing
[1:34:56] amen glory to
[1:34:58] God look the devil always wants you to
[1:35:01] fight him at his own
[1:35:03] grounds and when you fight the devil at
[1:35:05] his own ground you'll lose every time
[1:35:09] amen amen glory but's see look we need
[1:35:12] the wisdom of God Amen and the Very
[1:35:15] wisdom of God is foolishness to to men
[1:35:18] today
[1:35:20] amen amen he's given them a simple way
[1:35:23] to amen there's only one door one way
[1:35:26] and he's given that to every men
[1:35:28] everyone on the face of this Earth amen
[1:35:31] but they still have some different idea
[1:35:33] on how to get to him yeah amen you got
[1:35:36] the homosexuals they think it's this way
[1:35:38] amen you got this group they think it's
[1:35:40] this way
[1:35:42] amen when there's only one way and then
[1:35:45] when you try to present that way to them
[1:35:47] brother Byer it's so simple that it
[1:35:50] still baffles their mind right
[1:35:55] amen you know that very way that God has
[1:35:59] provided that the whole human race can
[1:36:02] fit into that
[1:36:04] way amen but it baffles men today
[1:36:07] they're like oh that's too
[1:36:12] narrow amen that's too narrow my how
[1:36:18] many's glad to have the mind of
[1:36:20] Christ amen glory to God I'm glad he's
[1:36:24] made a way to include us amen look it
[1:36:27] might be really choppy this morning amen
[1:36:29] but look there's so many different types
[1:36:31] of weapon amen we saw in the Bible we
[1:36:34] can see and read it amen you can even
[1:36:37] picture and try to imagine it how those
[1:36:39] walls just crumbled down amen glory to
[1:36:42] God and how God was so unique and how
[1:36:45] how destroying all those walls but there
[1:36:47] was that little piece that was standing
[1:36:49] up so Rahab could be saved
[1:36:55] amen look God can take away amen God can
[1:37:01] put amen the Bible talks about how he
[1:37:04] can take away Kings and place New
[1:37:07] Kings amen he can take away a president
[1:37:10] and put a new president in there or
[1:37:12] whoever he wants in there amen God will
[1:37:14] always be in
[1:37:16] control amen and right now the way it's
[1:37:19] going on nobody knows amen it's it's
[1:37:22] it's confusing using to the world
[1:37:25] today amen but I look we're serving a
[1:37:28] God that can give you rest this morning
[1:37:30] can give you peace amen I'm not relying
[1:37:33] on who the president is amen I'm relying

[1:37:42] promised the curses amen
[1:37:44] glory amen he said I place before you
[1:37:48] life and death amen that un least he

[1:37:57] life amen glory to God who are you
[1:38:00] choosing today amen look and how God
[1:38:03] uses you amen can you imagine Jonah I
[1:38:06] mean uh uh
[1:38:09] job job just a simple
[1:38:13] man do I have time brother job amen can
[1:38:20] you
[1:38:21] imagine look his battle was completely
[1:38:25] different amen he was kind of he was
[1:38:28] basically all
[1:38:31] alone even his own wife turned you know
[1:38:34] and said hey why don't you just curse
[1:38:35] God and
[1:38:36] die his
[1:38:39] friends turned and accused him of secret
[1:38:44] sin amen but there's one thing job had
[1:38:47] was
[1:38:48] a he had a sacrifice amen that he had
[1:38:52] placed on the Altar and he had
[1:38:54] confidence in that sacrifice
[1:38:56] amen amen and there was a sacrifice made
[1:38:59] more than 2,000 years ago and my
[1:39:02] confidence is still on that sacrifice
[1:39:07] amen glory to God but look at him can
[1:39:10] you imagine look there was a time
[1:39:14] Lucifer was the right-hand man of God
[1:39:17] Amen he was the daykeeper he was the son
[1:39:21] of the Morning Star amen
[1:39:25] and the Bible says he was pretty much
[1:39:27] equal the only thing he couldn't was
[1:39:29] create that's why everything does today
[1:39:32] is
[1:39:33] pervert amen he just perverts what's
[1:39:36] already been created but there he is
[1:39:39] amen look and he was cut off he was
[1:39:42] what cast down out of
[1:39:45] Heaven at that time Satan and God didn't
[1:39:50] have no connection not that God didn't
[1:39:52] know what Satan was doing
[1:39:55] but there was a time Satan could not go
[1:39:57] back up
[1:39:59] there but the only reason he made it
[1:40:02] back up there was because of the fall in
[1:40:04] the
[1:40:05] garden because Satan now became the
[1:40:11] accuser so now he keeps running back to
[1:40:13] God and says H have you not noticed your
[1:40:16] servant over
[1:40:18] there but aren't you glad he's saying I
[1:40:20] don't know what you're talking about
[1:40:24] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:40:25] it's covered amen but there was a time
[1:40:30] amen when the devil amen he was they
[1:40:35] were walking for and there
[1:40:38] God said
[1:40:41] hey have you considered my servant
[1:40:45] job here he was having a communication
[1:40:48] having a conversation with Satan amen
[1:40:53] and look he's the accuser but aren't you
[1:40:56] glad one day that's going to stop that's
[1:40:59] G to He he'll never have any more
[1:41:01] connection he'll never have to accuse
[1:41:03] you of
[1:41:06] anything but there he was
[1:41:08] amen and here God makes a
[1:41:11] challenge amen look Satan never
[1:41:15] approached God and challenged
[1:41:18] God God's the one that made the
[1:41:20] challenge to Satan said hey have you you
[1:41:24] considered because all all you know when
[1:41:26] they said what are you doing here Satan
[1:41:28] says what you know what you up to oh you
[1:41:30] know I'm just I'm just walking
[1:41:34] around yeah he's just walking around
[1:41:38] amen and God says well haven't you not
[1:41:41] considered my my servant job you know
[1:41:44] he's he's upright he's
[1:41:47] perfect amen he's found
[1:41:52] Grace
[1:41:54] Glory of course you know the devil said
[1:41:56] well of course you know there's nothing
[1:41:59] I can do because you got your hands on
[1:42:01] him you
[1:42:02] know God makes a challenge amen here's a
[1:42:07] battle now look at this battle here's a
[1:42:10] battle that job never even knew that he
[1:42:13] was
[1:42:15] in amen God makes a challenge to the
[1:42:19] devil says have you considered my
[1:42:21] servant job their joke right away became
[1:42:25] the
[1:42:28] battlefield he became the battlefield
[1:42:30] either he liked it or not he didn't even
[1:42:33] know it brother
[1:42:35] berer and then so here the devil takes
[1:42:39] the challenge he says you take your hand
[1:42:41] off him I'll take the challenge God says
[1:42:44] okay he said you do whatever and he'll
[1:42:46] never curse
[1:42:48] me amen here
[1:42:51] job living a simple life amen glory to
[1:42:54] God Amen everything's going
[1:42:58] good he loved the Lord he worshiped God
[1:43:01] he was faithful he made his sacrifice
[1:43:03] when he did amen and he had confidence
[1:43:06] in that sacrifice look when the devil
[1:43:08] accused him of secret
[1:43:10] sin he knew he could be you know he was
[1:43:13] he was confident yeah amen he says no I
[1:43:17] made a
[1:43:18] sacrifice I know my sins are
[1:43:21] forgiven amen but there's one thing that
[1:43:24] job did not know he became the
[1:43:26] Battleground and he didn't even know it
[1:43:29] amen and brother Brandon says the
[1:43:31] greatest battle you'll fight amen is in
[1:43:34] the
[1:43:36] mine amen and a lot of times you're
[1:43:38] fighting yourself
[1:43:43] amen amen and look and the devil will
[1:43:46] come with all kinds of
[1:43:49] weapons cuz the Bible is not saying
[1:43:52] weapons are not form but how he forms
[1:43:54] that weapon amen it's good to be on
[1:43:56] God's side and be close to him so he can
[1:43:58] give you that discernment when he is
[1:44:00] forming a weapon and placing it
[1:44:04] there and there's your greatest battle
[1:44:06] in the mind amen so here's
[1:44:09] job being the battlefield and God and
[1:44:13] Satan is going at
[1:44:15] it and it's still the same today
[1:44:19] amen and we've become the battlefield
[1:44:23] amen but the battle is his and how many
[1:44:26] times that he said there in Chronicles
[1:44:29] in that story he said even in this
[1:44:32] battle you won't have to
[1:44:34] fight that's what they were told he says
[1:44:37] when he says even this battle jeat you
[1:44:41] won't have to fight amen glory and in
[1:44:44] your mind amen the devil will creep in
[1:44:47] and he wants you to fight him at his own
[1:44:49] ground and you and he knows you won't
[1:44:51] win
[1:44:54] amen but when you can go to this ground
[1:44:58] and then stand on this and say Satan it
[1:45:00] is written it is written it is written
[1:45:03] amen glory to God then that's when devil
[1:45:07] has to fight God at his own ground and
[1:45:10] he'll never
[1:45:12] win amen glory but can you imagine the
[1:45:15] life of Job when there he saw his
[1:45:17] children gone just like that and in an
[1:45:20] instant his wealth just like that and
[1:45:22] then before not his health begin
[1:45:25] to be gone
[1:45:29] too amen a battle he not know about he
[1:45:34] was just living the life and all of this
[1:45:36] was going on but you know what because
[1:45:38] of that sacrifice he had confidence in
[1:45:40] it that no matter what the devil did
[1:45:42] took his children took his wealth took
[1:45:44] his health amen and all of that he fell
[1:45:47] on his face and worshiped
[1:45:49] God Amen
[1:45:53] my I wonder here the devil brought a
[1:45:56] weapon called
[1:45:59] discouragement amen can you imagine if
[1:46:01] there was anyone that would really be
[1:46:03] discouraged be
[1:46:05] job
[1:46:08] heartbroken
[1:46:10] amen the devil brought a weapon on on on
[1:46:13] job to here job could have just gave up
[1:46:17] curs
[1:46:19] God Amen is anybody here going through
[1:46:22] like job
[1:46:24] but look sometimes God does allow us to
[1:46:27] go through things that sometimes we're
[1:46:28] about to give
[1:46:30] up and just because we don't understand
[1:46:33] things and that because it works on our
[1:46:36] mind that battle's there amen but look
[1:46:39] you gotta you got to tell yourself this
[1:46:41] battle is not mine it's God's amen it's
[1:46:44] just tell it's just God showing me that
[1:46:47] he's got confidence in me that I today
[1:46:49] can still have confidence in that
[1:46:51] sacrifice 2,000 years
[1:46:54] ago praise the Lord glory to God it is
[1:46:57] written amen
[1:47:00] hallelujah the weapons amen they are
[1:47:05] formed we need to discern them you love
[1:47:09] him amen I hope something was
[1:47:12] said amen that that that when we leave
[1:47:14] from here we can say oh didn't our
[1:47:16] hearts burn within us amen and maybe we
[1:47:19] can ponder on these things amen maybe I
[1:47:21] didn't bring it out like some educated
[1:47:23] men or or with words or some even Paul
[1:47:26] said I don't come to you with excellen
[1:47:28] and speech and all of that but look
[1:47:30] let's just where the where the word can
[1:47:32] be demonstrated amen that we can really
[1:47:35] show the power of God
[1:47:37] Amen he's got a great weapon and look
[1:47:41] God knows how to use his weapons amen
[1:47:43] and you're one of them you're one of
[1:47:46] them a weapon in the hands of God Amen

[1:47:52] good amen I believe he spoke to our
[1:47:54] hearts he spoke to me amen glory to God

[1:47:59] amen we can we can have one sermon and
[1:48:01] go from one Church to One Church one
[1:48:03] church and preach the same thing and
[1:48:05] sometimes God goes a different direction
[1:48:07] but when you're a pastor when Wednesday
[1:48:09] gets here it's got to be a different
[1:48:12] sermon amen but God knows how to use
[1:48:16] things amen he knows you know pastors
[1:48:19] are unique amen and God knows how to use
[1:48:22] them for the flock amen he knows how
[1:48:24] there's a five-fold Ministry I believe
[1:48:26] that and I believe that's a great weapon
[1:48:28] in the hands of God Amen and it's it's
[1:48:31] what it's to get a people ready Amen to
[1:48:33] to that Perfection amen but we are to
[1:48:37] edify we are to take this word amen and
[1:48:40] and let God write it in your hearts amen
[1:48:42] that he may be able to project Amen to
[1:48:45] the world so you can edify
[1:48:49] it heyen God is good
[1:48:53] you love him amen glory I'm going to
[1:48:56] stop brother or I I'll keep going and
