it a great day yesterday praise the lord let give the lord say thank you jesus amen amen certainly can't complain about the weather amen so it's moving wonderful god bless you you can be seated this morning amen we have a little something special again this morning we have a testimony amen that somebody wants to give amen about what the lord's done for him so uh we know a couple weeks ago brother uh danny wade got baptized y'all remember amen and the lord did something for him and so he said he has a testimony i said well images come and share it this morning a minute before we get into the message and so better danny come on up if you will and give us a testimony but god's done always good to hear amen i'll tell you what it's a real blessing to see our young folks get baptized with the holy ghost amen so praise the lord brother danny wait he amen i told him guys yes the little work that he does too enough i guess a following with his testimony and everything and so i asked him to share a little bit of that too but hey god bless you buddy you know uh i got baptized um as uh you all remember um well uh i got baptized before like um the first uh baptism which it was i can say that i definitely didn't feel the holy ghost that time i was not dead with the holy ghost that time um yeah i'm really nervous right now but yeah um so so uh well i think i got baptized for the wrong reason like in that moment i was kind of like um i didn't really know what i was doing completely so so um for like a really long time i was like um i had it on my heart that i just felt like i should get baptized again i just knew that i was missing something and i knew i hadn't actually um got the holy ghost and so i just felt like that for like a really long time and and after a while i was like i was like i got to get baptized again sometime i was i i just had to because the kids um and at that point and i with my life i have been changing i've been growing closer to the lord so i decided to get baptized again and i was going to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ uh like the bible says in acts 2 38 so so um yeah so anyways um i knew i had to do the right thing and i got baptized so uh when i got in the water i i just believed with all my heart that i would receive the gift of the holy ghost because the bible says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if you repent and get baptized in the name of jesus christ so when i was in the water i knew that when i was going to come out the water i was going to get the gift of the holy ghost so when i went under the water and i came out i just felt a rush of of joy and peace it was so amazing it was the most amazing feeling i had ever felt and my hands went up without me even um thinking i i didn't raise my hands up because i decided you know i'll just raise my hands no my hands went up without me thinking at all all i could think about is that is how amazing it was to to feel the holy ghost i was just so glad and so joyful to receive the gift of the holy ghost it was so amazing and i i didn't want to leave that moment at all so i was just standing there with my hands up for a really long time it was the most amazing feeling i'd ever felt so i posted it on tick tock it has like over um 600 000 uh views on it now and yeah i've been like trying to preach the gospel and tick-tock so i got 6 000 followers on there now and and i i was thinking like on my tech talk channel i hadn't i was thinking i wasn't doing enough uh and and i don't think i was uh uh chan didn't making a difference well someone told me that that uh i had been in uh helping them to get closer to god and help them to to um to uh you know um and now they feel closer to god than they ever was and it's because of my channel and and i think that was so amazing so i have no idea what god has in store for me but um but i just i just feel like he has something huge for me i have no idea what it is i'm i don't know if i'm meant to be a pastor or not but i'm just trying to focus on on following him and doing what he wants me to do and what his will is for me so um uh thank you for um letting me uh get up here and yeah i'm really nervous i don't even know how to end this god bless you thanks a lot amen how many enjoyed that that was a good testimony amen we'll just be praying see what the lord will have for him certainly we'd like to see the lord amen use him in his kingdom amen praise the lord so god bless you this morning amen appreciate what the lord's doing among us amen how many appreciates the holy spirit amen and that's the main thing it's the holy ghost and certainly it's good to see when someone amen reaches out in faith amen and god honors that faith you know because if you have genuine faith the bible says that god is obligated and we'll give you the baptism of the holy ghost amen he'll accept that sacrifice give you the baptism of the holy ghost change you amen from what you was i'll never forget the day you mean i felt the same way danny amen when the holy ghost comes it is unspeakable uh joy and full of glory amen it's just no describing the peace amen and nothing ever and nothing else will ever take the place of that amen amen nothing's as good as what receiving the baptism of the holy ghost is amen receiving the new birth and serving the lord i was 20 years old amen when i i believe it's about 20 years old somewhere near when i received the baptism of the holy ghost and i certainly amen i'm thankful for that it changed my life amen and if it's a genuine new birth it holds amen so we're thankful for that god bless you good to see everybody this morning good to see everybody's face amen and so stand with me amen we'll go before the lord and just try to minister amen what the lord's laid on my heart to minister this morning and so i do thank each and every one of you for your prayers amen we're going to have a couple ministers here uh speaking for us here in the next couple of weeks amen and so we may even have one next sunday we'll see but i know the wednesday after that brother ted vasily so you might want to mark this on your calendar amen brother ted's going to speak us to us on a wednesday night amen not this coming wednesday but the following if my numbers are right and the following one after that's going to be brother paul hart from brother dewey's church up there brother paul hart amen he's going to come down the following sunday so we will have some venus visiting ministers i don't know about you but i'm here ready to hear some other preacher besides himself so amen but we do enjoy sharing with people the love of god and what he is and what he means and so it's always an honor and a privilege to speak about our lord amen and to be a blessing to god's people amen so amen we continue to pray for those that are not feeling well we thank god for those who he's healed good to see michelle here this morning i know she was pretty sick amen so god bless her glad to see her amen can't wait to see sister johnny's back again amen and so god is good praise the lord let's just power heads kind heavenly father we come up before your throne of grace lord again father on this beautiful winter day fall day perhaps lord in the beautiful days that you've given us lord and we do thank you for the opportunity and the freedom lord jesus to be able to worship you yet in spirit any truth father and lord we just ask god that you'll come in a special way speak to your people along the way lord and father say the things that you want to be said but especially bring your anointing both upon the speaker and on the ears of the hearers lord jesus come and make your presence known this morning father and lord we just thank you father for being with us even in us and to the end of the world lord just bless the meditation of our heart now we ask god that you just take this little thought that i feel you've laid out my heart to speak on and lord and say what you once said this morning father thank you for all your blessings lord jesus and for all the miracles that you do in our lives daily lord so many of them that we don't recognize we ask these blessings in your precious name in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen turn your bibles this morning and this morning i want to take and uh take another thought and i've been kind of praying for the lord to perhaps given me a winter series i haven't preached on a series for a very long time amen but maybe this will be one that'll uh maybe the lord will kind of give you something here amen kind of a series amen and we want to just speak on uh you know we spoke on god's thoughts and then last week we spoke on god's miracles and this morning i want to speak on god our guide god our guide amen amen so we just want to talk about god and what he is amen because he's certainly the only one worth really talking about amen praise the lord so in saint john if you will let's turn to saint john i think i've got my mic on yeah we're on okay saint john the 16th chapter and i was just going to read a few verses but as i went further up i just seen more that was it's just all good so i want to read from verse 1 down to verse 13. now these things have i spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that they do that he doeth god's service amen quite a statement right there isn't it they'll actually kill you thinking they're serving god they're doing goddess service amen and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me but these things have i told you that when the time shall come you may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asks me whether goes thou but because i have said these things unto you sorrow has filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth it's expedient that i go away for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me knows that the original sin is unbelief only one sin and that is unbelief amen he that believeth not shall be damned amen so it is it is absolute sin to not believe what god said of righteousness because i go to my father in other words he's going to prove that what he said was right and everything is righteousness is only in christ because he did raise from the dead he did what he said he was going to do amen and then of course he says of course and you see me no more and of judgment because the prince of this world is judged i have yet many things to say you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning amen so we see here that jesus clearly made it clear that he still had a lot of things that he wanted the church to know there's going to be a lot more things said but it's going to be when the holy spirit comes back in his church isn't that right and of course we realize that paul was one of those instruments that god used to speak through amen because paul said let him that is spiritual or a prophet let him acknowledge that the things that we write unto you are the commandments of the lord amen so the things that paul taught in corinthians and romans and hebrews and all these different books you know those are all the commandments of god those are all things that god was going to show us amen so he says there's going to be a furtherance of it but let me just begin with this by saying that we live truly we live in a world of darkness how many beliefs we're living in darkness the whole world gropes in darkness with no light nothing so uh you know how many knows that jesus was the light of the world in this darkness jesus had become the word had become the light amen of the world and he truly is the light now something else i want to say that we actually were born our first birth by our mom and dad brought us into a world of darkness we were actually born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies how many know that's one of the first things that a kid will do when they come of age is tell lies and then it's the easiest thing for them to do is to lie about something amen we come into the world bible says speaking lies so we're born the wrong way with the wrong nature amen and we were born in darkness amen our eyes or shall we say blind amen because we were blind to god you can't see the things of god that's why jesus said that unless a man is born again he cannot see amen where he's going he cannot see the kingdom of god so the first thing that has to happen to a person in order for you to be able to be guided you know right it's for you to have your eyes open for your amen to realize what it's really all about what the kingdom of god is really all about so it's certainly a dark darkness that is around us and uh born in darkness and so forth god is truly the light of the world jesus is the light of the world and without jesus the whole world gropes in that darkness without without the light you're going to be the blind stumbling along and the jesus said if the blind lead the blind they're both going to fall in the ditch and i want to say that the world and the condition that it's going they are groping in darkness they are in the darkness of the world amen and they will find themselves in the ditch of the tribulation period that's why they'll find themselves one of these days because they don't have the guide to lead them amen now one place i realized probably god said you know those that are on the broad way they don't need a guide i mean it's easy to go down the broad way but to go down the narrow way amen you have to have a guide amen and this road that you have to have to guide on amen at least to everlasting life but the bible says there you know narrow is the way and few there be that find it amen so we have to have people don't think so but you really have to have a guide in this world amen so i'm going to preach a message out of the course brother man preach message on the guide amen let me just begin here can i now notice he says a guide has to know the way he has to know where he's going and what he's doing and how to take care of you along the right road he's got to see that you don't come up lost amen a god is a selected man the state selects this man if he is a guide and now in going on a trip in the wilderness where perhaps you're not used to going amen how many knows that you and i that we're perhaps even amen going down the road that we're not used to going amen we don't know what the future holds do we we don't know what tomorrow holds amen but we have a guide to guide us amen so now notice he says and perhaps you're not used to going it's not a good thing for you to go without one frankly some places he says you can't even go out into these mountains without a god for instance canada the god has to sign your license and the game warden he has to sign himself in and he is responsible for you if anything happens to you it's his responsibility amen amen he's got to take care of you see and if you do get lost he's got to know the country so well that he can pick you up just at any time he's got to know these things or he cannot be a guide amen he cannot be a licensed guide unless he knows the wilderness praise be to god amen and for these things he says sometimes you have to have an appointment you got to call ahead make arrangements get reservations to be taken out into these wildernesses now anybody that's ever been in the woods i only remember one time ever getting lost amen i want to only remember one time getting lost amen in the woods and it was on a on a on a lunch break amen because i love the woods and i always like to go and explore the woods and so at lunch break when i was laboring for masonry crew and so forth at lunch i went for a little walk and so i i just went for a little walk and i didn't come back till three o'clock that afternoon and of course you can just imagine you know what my boss they were like where did that guy go you know but you know you think you know where you're going hey you have no idea where you're going when you're lost you actually think you're going in one direction you're going the absolute opposite direction of what you're going and thank god that where i'm at there was a little road there wasn't too far before i hit a road and man it wouldn't have been for that how many knows how many know what the death walk is and then you go in complete circles when you're lost you end up making what the indians call the death walk you end up in the same and it is isn't it amazing i think it's it's absolutely amazing how that you wouldn't end up way out somewhere else but you're somehow or other you end up right where you was before i don't know how that works but you know that's pretty much how it works and so but you know uh you know you look at that and it's that way and in the canada out west perhaps you know if you go into places that you've never been before and the wilderness is so vast that if you go out there very far you're bound to get lost amen and you and i are in the wilderness today how many knows and without somebody amen telling you the way that knows the way knows the wilderness amen you're going to end up perishing not just lost but perishing how many knows jesus says i am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me you're not going to make it without jesus christ because he is the way amen and he knows the way he created this whole thing he laid out the wilderness so he knows the way he'll never get you lost jesus said all that come unto me i will in no wise cast now aren't you glad for following somebody like that that knows the way amen he's given us that you know he's given people don't realize it but the book of life amen the book of life this is the book of life and then if you want to know about life this is it right here the way through life the way through this wilderness is right here the directions are right here aren't you glad for that this morning because if it wasn't for that you would be as lost as lost could be you wouldn't know which way to turn you don't know where you are you don't know who you are you don't know where you come from what a terrible state to be and let me tell you isn't it sad that in our uh political world that we've taught our kids amen that we come from monkeys he they confuse them from where they come from and now they don't know what they're here for let alone where they're going it brought mass confusion amen that's partially largely the reason that the world is in the condition that it's in it's because of what we've taught the people we've gotten them away from the guys this is the guide in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh jesus christ the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he came to show us the way amen aren't you glad that there's the way this morning praise be to god god found me wandering in the wilderness when i was 20 years old he found me i didn't find him he found me amen wandering lost didn't know where i was going [Applause] [Music] hey man but i'm thankful for a guide this morning so notice he says when you plan on going through it's nice to call ahead it's nice to make make arrangements get resurrect get reservations to be taken out now i may notice that one of these days certainly we're going to be taken out of this world we're going to be taken out of here but you better have some reservations made you better have some plans made praise be to god oh my sometimes he can't take you but listen our heavenly father can always take it now and if you don't get these preparations made and you're figuring that you're going to take a trip into the wilderness where you haven't been before you may come up lost and perish i want you to know that's exactly what we're going through we're through going through a wilderness right now it's a dark wilderness and it's twice as bad at night being lost still in the wilderness you can't barely see ahead of you where are you going that also typifies the world in which we're living and where we're going through it's a dark world amen and you perhaps don't know what the next step is what's going to happen next amen there's the one man one time the kingdom brother batman says i don't believe anything that you can't scientifically prove amen brother brown says contrary wise i don't believe anything that i can scientifically proof i don't believe a thing that you can scientifically prove well i'm right here that's right no you're not going to be here after a while you'll be dust that's not real huh only that which is not scientifically those things like and then he says i prove to you he meant you know he says well he said you say you love your wife well hulk show me your love how can you prove your love see you can't see it you know and then he asked man he says where do you live he says well i live up over the hill and down over the valley over there he says and it's getting dark he says how are you gonna you can't see how to get there how are you ever gonna make it he says well i got this lantern here and i'm to follow this path and i'm going to make it all the way home he says that's what we're doing i mean we're in this wilderness but we're going to go home because we got this light because of this light that we have it's going to show us how to get home it's going to show us how to get out of here without that lantern then you'd be walking and stumbling all over the place amen he that don't have no light in his life stumbles the whole world is stumbling and staggering russia is stumbling and staggering china is stumbling and staggering i mean north korea is stumbling and staggering hitler stumble and say america is certainly stumbling and falling on their face because they don't have a guide anymore they left a guy only reason that a person has to be in a lost state is because they don't follow the guide [Music] let me tell you the only reason that you ain't got joy unspeakable and full of glory it's because you don't follow the god because this guide said that i'll give you joy that the world can't take i give you peace that passes understanding if you ain't got it don't blame god he doesn't told us how to get it amen if you ain't got it this morning don't blame god amen people that don't want to follow the god they're the only ones that's going to end up lost and on the day of judgment god's not going to say he says you know they're going to say well i wasn't saved and so forth he is just gonna say i gave you the brother didn't i i had many infallible proofs that i showed you why wouldn't you believe you didn't wore it you willfully walk away why didn't you accept that i gave you the remedy hey we got a slew of problems in this world this world's full of problems but he gave us the remedy didn't yay amen praise the lord oh you got to make some preparations let me tell you something before you leave this world you better make some arrangements you better have some preparations made you better talk to this guy because it's going to be a dark night it's going to be a dark place when you begin to take your last breath when you begin to go out of this world you better have your guide amen oh my listen to this so if you go out there and you uh take a trip you haven't been there or you come up lost you're gonna perish he says you've got about one percent chance to get out of that wilderness you get lost in some of those wilderness you got about a one percent chance that's not very much to get out of this wilderness that's right if it isn't too dense you might have one percent chance to get out by yourself but if it's very bad wilderness way back you haven't got a chance to get out let me tell you something this wilderness is bad you ain't got no chance to get out without a guy amen you find yourself on the death walk amen you're done then you're finished you'll perish if you haven't got a guy that knows the country and knows how to get you back and how to find you oh i can only imagine being out there lost amen and then finding come having your guy come walking up to you he says well i knew pretty much where he was going to be at huh and that's the way it is with god isn't that right god knows where you're at he's going to find you in this wilderness he won't lose the one because he knows the wilderness he knows where everybody's at because he's a perfect guide you love him oh my now listen to this now i'm going to take a few stories if that's okay this morning and i want to take illustrations out of those stories if i could the one is about the boy scouts in arizona that ended up going out into the wilderness in that right and they got lost it says that they were trained to know how to take care of themselves they were full scouts not partial scouts they were not just cub scouts they were full scouts and tate to trick up and trip up into the mountains and a snow storm came up nature changed its position how many believes this world is changing its position huh and they found themselves lost all of them and they perished is because something comes up and changed from the regular routine they didn't know how to get out and i don't forget how many boys that was that perished in the mountain they had helicopters to militia out the general guards national guards volunteer help and everything but they were lost no one knew where they were at and they could not take care of themselves they all perished in the snow because they didn't know whether they was going east or north or west up or down and how it was everything looked the same whenever change come amen they didn't know how to deal with that change in their right they didn't have somebody that had the knowledge of what was going on let me just take it a little bit back if i could let's talk about israel but how many knows that it was god that pulled israel out of egypt and they began to follow moses he was their leader amen let me say he was their leader but he was not their guy amen why because god was their guide is that right and so whenever change happened to them and they got out into that wilderness they come down to that red sea and they couldn't turn to the left they couldn't turn to the right they come to a dead end they had a change to come something happened that they weren't used to oh they were dancing and they were shouting when they were leaving but little did they know what was laid ahead now let me tell you this about our great god our great leader our great leader is not what the world thinks that he is a lot of times because we would think oh god's going to lead you into amen shady green pastures all the time that he's going to lead you to a flowery bed of ease that everything's going to go good that's not how our guide guides us he don't guide us into all these wonderful great places these boys they'd have been fine perhaps if the weather would have stayed the same and everything would have stayed the same but things changed on them just like god allows change to come into your life he allows change to come into my life amen because he wants to see what we're going to do at those times amen the song says in shady green pastures so rich and so sweet god leads his dear children alone amen just like brother danny said just like i testified when i first got born again i thought i could just almost float up in the air and float away because i felt my shoulders were so light amen i was so oh my name is such a piece such a wonderful feeling i couldn't express it he was just so awesome huh it was so beautiful kind of like the story of the eagles in the nest amen it was such nice wool it's such a beautiful place but then after a while god begins to take some of that wool away he let stickers come up amen and poke you and things we get uncomfortable things get all terribly failing and everything else there's churches and they have fusses and fights and they have this that are in the other we've got where i come from all kinds of false doctrines floating around and people criticizing the pastor and everything else oh man i thought we all was happier i want big happy family a sticker here and a sticker there [Music] uh all that wonderful feeling and you begin to say whoa what is all this well that's just like a little eagle story so with god begin to bring israel down to the rescue and bring them to a place where they couldn't get nowhere they didn't know what to do what did we do and what was the first thing they did did they say look i know that it was god that led us here huh and i know we can't go forward and the egyptians we hear them you hear them that thunder that's a 50 000 chariots coming after us that's the sign of horses that sound of trained soldiers coming to get us to take us and make us slaves again the enemy is hot on our heels so to speak but nowhere to go did they say did they say i know that the one that led us here will make a way amen how many knows that with god there is no dead ends when god's leading you he's not going to lead you into a dead end it's your life eternal right even if it's to death because sometimes god even leads people right to death because when he leads you he leads you with snail scarred hands amen he knows where death is he knows what that's all about he knows what to do when you get down to that door aren't you glad for a guy that knows what to do when you get there too no matter where you are no matter what it is god will see us through praise be to god aren't you glad to have a guide you can't leave it you can't make it without this guide you can't make it without god amen praise be to god and these balls all perished and guess what how many knows that there's a lot of them in the children of israel that perished why did they perish what the bible said they all perished in the wilderness in hebrews it says they did not know my ways they didn't know how i guided i don't guide and give you a flower bed of easy god's love isn't a uh what did i hear brother ramsay today it's not puppy dog love oh look at the little puppy oh i just love the little puppy no no it's rugged it tests you it tries you it makes something out of you it doesn't just spoil your rotten god's love isn't uh uh what do you call it small child spoiling you god doesn't spoil you he didn't spoil them he brought him down to that red sea and that was his love because he wanted him to realize hey if god is the one that lets you hear he'll make a way how many believes that in your life remember this whenever god whenever if god is leading you and brother man preached a message called stand still am i right amen he leads you to what seems like a dead end then just hold still can't go forward can't go but just hold still don't do like israel did and go to complaining moses you are a sorry leader moses you brought us out here to get us all to bury us all here by the red sea because there wasn't enough graves in egypt god saw that sorely displeased god when they complained and when they remembered the bible even says because of their complaining and their murmuring he said that he sent fiery serpents among them and they bit them and they oh they spiritually died because they complained and they murmured people will spiritually die when you get a complaining and a murmuring spirit on you you're not alive you're god doesn't have the holy ghost don't do that brother joe god the holy ghost oh no i'm not happy with this and i'm not happy with no the holy ghost don't do that the holy ghost says look though he sends me to hell yet i'll praise him like don't he slay me yet i'll trust him that's what the holy ghost said amen dude job's wife said why don't you just curse god and now you speak like a foolish woman the lord gave the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord that's what the holy ghost says are you with me this morning holy ghost is always positive and that's what god was looking for out of the children of israel even though he guided him into that place at that place of something that's different a place of change let me tell you some how many knows we're living in the world of change what does that mean that just means you need to hold the hand of your guide a little bit closer stay close to the guide when it gets dark and you don't have a light and man or not you get five a foot away from your guide you might not be able to see him and then i don't know about you but i'm gonna hold his hand give me your hand don't you let go man i'm counting on you to get me home because you're responsible for me oh man i'm persuaded paul says that the one that has started a good work in me is able to perform it but you got to say in him amen i believe it was jesus said that he did abideth in me and me and him amen the same shall bring forth much fruit if you abide in me and i abide in you but god you're going to be lost really quick amen [Music] and finally the children of israel were all lost how many of they were lost because of their unbelief because every time they come to a new place a strange place this thing's changed that right how many knows it should have been good enough when god opened up the red sea they walked out on dry land amen the clay down in the bottom of that river whatever it was that knee-deep mud dried up they could ride their horses and their cows with their hooves that would dig in they all went on dry ground across the whoo can you ima i don't know about you but i had to join miriam i'd have been with them sisters probably dancing up and down them said well look how great god is we serve our awesome god that's right how many believe we serve our awesome god because i want to tell you right now that we're going right down in the middle of satan's eating we're right in the dead middle of satan's evening we're making this journey amen and we love god more than we ever have we worship him more than ever we praise him more than ever hallelujah that's a miracle in itself everybody is getting lukewarm everybody's getting lackadaisical ray leia's rubbing off on people people's worried about polish i'm not you just go go go search what brother madam said about politics and getting your mind off of this politics mess either get your mind off all that mess amen she says that's all a bunch of foolishness and then i found that quote better scene where he talks about god says he thinks it's all a bunch of foolishness it doesn't matter but around it don't matter a bit who's the next president ain't gonna do anything for you all right it's all it's all long gone anyway after 56 it didn't really matter who was president it didn't matter who was president in 1956 it's history it's gone it's gonna burn hello so get our minds off of all of that rubbish and let's get it on the word of god let's get it on god let's think about our guide that is guiding us through this wilderness saying lord god me don't you let go of my hand and then we're going through dangerous places dark places lord i need your hand amen i'll be lost and perish because there's too many wolves out there hungry wolves that are ready to devour you [Music] amen you better stay close to the guy because god the guy's got all the things that you need to survive this world has everything you need to survive praise the lord all right all right so now notice now we're going through a wilderness we're on our road somewhere and we can't get along without this guy and dare anybody to try to substitute any other guide huh if you do he'll take a line and that right this guy knows the way he knows every inch of the way he knows every thought that's in your heart and so forth a guide a correct guide he will guide you to all of the truth how many knows that's where the problem lays i mean if people don't want them the truth that god gives after amen he left the earth they don't want all the truth amen praise the lord all right let me uh give you another story first can i an unthoughtful father and i thought the father two years ago in colorado he was going up into the mountains and he had a little boy about six seven years old he was going to take him on his first deer hunt so they went high in the mountains and the little boy said to daddy daddy i'm getting tired how many knows that little boy is just not going to be able to go as far as what you go so first of all i don't know about you but if it was me i would kind of find out how far my son can go on his own two feet and back so i have to pack him on my back if i didn't want to go further i have to say how much strength how young am i am i my 20s 30s 40s how how young am i how far can i carry this boy myself back how many knows you need to calculate for those things this man didn't calculate for that he was unthoughtful father so they went high in the mountains a little boy said i'm getting tired he said get on my back we're not high enough yet the deers are way up on high way up there he didn't know he was a city man he didn't know nothing about how to hunt or where to go and any man knows and uh anything about the wilderness knows the day the deer don't stay up there on them rocks and them high places they'll go up there goats stay up there not there they're down here where they can feed and they got to get to where there's something to eat and so but this man thought if i got way up there in the rocks sway up here i'll find a big buck i mean this is a good time to sell this isn't it and he had seen a picture all right here's the point he had seen a picture of some standing up on a big rock so he thought that's where he'd find him amen let me tell you something there's millions of people that's going to be lost because they've been painted the wrong picture they're following the wrong thought amen oh well god doesn't care about how you dress or what is that that's the wrong picture amen let me finish the story he had seen some picture up there all right he thought that's where he'd find him don't you pay attention to what the magazines read and so forth you'll have a nightmare there's only one thing to do is to take a guide where you know where you're at and this man didn't know where he was what he was doing he had nobody with him to direct him and he held his own little son against his bosom until he felt him cool off and die it got stormy that night uh i didn't read some of it but he talks about how that he went way up too high and it got dark on it and then it got cold amen and he had to pull up his own son into his bosom and he cooled off and he died unthoughtful if he just had a guide with him he cut it could have brought him right back down the mountains regardless of what time that it was how many knows you may get into places where you never know that you don't know what's going on but if you've got a guide he has a way of bringing you back where you're supposed to be i'm just thankful for that if you ever go off somewhere you know you stray away from god if your god is your god he'll catch you and he'll bring you back right where you're supposed to be and this man he was unthoughtful what did he do it cost his own life and his cost son's life because of a picture that had been painted him a thought that was in his mind i thought about the denominational churches amen of how they they'll tell people they'll live any way you want do anything you want ah you'll be in heaven that is a false picture folks you're going to find yourself in the tribulation period god doesn't work that way how many is this guy he knows what he's doing but you have to people think they know about more about it than the guy does lean to their own understanding more than the vindicated proven word of god amen my my let's talk about another one let's talk about these death walk for a minute the death walk round go again i this time let me just pick up a story while i'm at it brother batman remember when he was taking his wife on his honeymoon and he went up into these mountains right and he went way up there he went so far up there and i believe it was snowing and he was got real blizzard in everything and he says i better get back and so he hit it back and he hit it back and went way back there and all of a sudden he found himself right back by his kill how did i get here and he says ah i'm a guide i can find my way out of here he tried it again and he ended up there same place again huh and the third time he says well i'm going to try with everything i got i i know which way to go and i show something touched him on his shoulder and that right says i'm a very present help in time of trouble just call on me folks if you're going in circles being maybe because of your unbelief or amen because you think you can guide yourself i can do this you're going in circles and there's too much unbelief there you better call on the guy and say god help i need a little help here you can't go you can't go your own way and expect that you're going to come out right no it has to be the way that god you need the help of almighty god if you're ever going to make this out of right amen otherwise what do you do when you go your own way and you think you can do it all you're going to do is on a giant death walk go round and round let me try this again let me try this again it's just a death walk when god ever reaches down a minute he grabs a hold of your hand because we know that brother madam said the third time he was going to go and he was going to he's going to head out he started to go didn't he he started to head out and something touched him on his shoulder in the right and he looked back when he looked back um god's hand opened up all of that storm and all of that snow and he opened up a channel to where he could see that tower and that line that tower i believe it was and that right just just give him a glimpse he says if i went the way i thought that i was going to go he says i would have headed straight towards canada he was going the perfectly wrong way thinking that he with all of his ability all of his knowledge of the woods huh can we say that about ourselves that all of our ability and all of our knowledge of the word if you try to do it your way you're going to end up heading the perfectly wrong direction it's not about your knowledge and your ability it's about surrendering to almighty god amen and let him open up the way so that you can see and then that closed back up but he knew which way to go and he was going through that stuff and he'd feel his tree he'd feel this but he was a they had run a wire from an understand from that tower down to their cabin and if you ever could get a hold of that wire he knew he had it and he went and he fell down fell finally he grabbed that wire i don't know about you but he was a happy man why because he had the lifeline now brother bam says that's the way it was with brother branham that's the way it was with danny that's the way it was me any of you that's born again amen you didn't know where to go you didn't know how to do it but he showed you the way if you can believe them lord jesus christ thou shalt be saved and when that drops down into your heart get repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if you ever got that if that ever absolutely manifests to you you have got a hold of that wire folks it just saved your life you got a hold of something that'll lead you and guide you amen until you're 58 years old from 20. and it doesn't matter how many dead ends it seems like you come to know many times how many times you feel like you run out of food and run out of water and all kinds of bad stuff happens to you it doesn't matter as long as you got a guide he will guide you through it brother bam said the greatest miracles aren't the ones that you see the eyes coming to you know coming and the ears opening he says the greatest miracles is when you can't go over it can't go under can't go around and if you just wait on god and watch god take you through that's the greatest miracle amen how many believe that praise the lord because i don't know about you but there's nobody here that wants to do like israel did huh and that was when they come out of egypt they all rejoice with miriam and all they were praising god but little did they know only 40 miles only 40 miles isn't that right and it took them 40 years to get 40 miles but the bible taught us he says that those people were not fit to go into the promised land yet they wouldn't believe god so guess what they had to go through around the testing hill the testing hill the testing mountains go around and around and around and around it meant to get rid of all the unbelief sometimes we have to go in circles and circles to get rid of the unbelief until it's gone isn't that right it's not not it's a terrible place to be amen we don't want to go in circles we want to go straight towards calvin amen praise the lord amen no amen all right let's talk about another one let's talk about when a man is lost amen brother bram says this about when a man is lost did you ever see a man that was lost yeah i thought i saw one this morning amen me and my wife kind of came early and i went down through the car wash and ran through it because it was all dirty went to the car wash and then we went back to the house we had a little air errand we wanted to run and as we was going back in you know we seen a millennial i guess a boy about 18 19 20 years old now i went to walmart before and i've seen a woman with completely orange hair i don't know about you but that's just not really natural to me i guess somebody really likes color right but this morning right downtown there by the post office there was a young man walking and we both looked and he had completely blue blue hair that's right the whole thing blue blue hair donna she was like my you know i said i said the boy needs jesus i said the boy needs jesus that's the only reason you go through those type of things is because you need jesus how many of those people need jesus hello ain't no telling what i'd have if it wasn't for jesus you'd be making fun of me this morning if i didn't have jesus i'd look funny i'd be funny i'd do crazy things i'd be crazy i would be crazy if i didn't have jesus but now i'm crazy for jesus amen how about you but i you know that's right down in our tom you might see it in nashville you might see it in california but now it's in elkton and that's right you can see in elkin you can see girl two girls going down holding hands no not some other city that's in our precious little town well i moved out but still considered it our town i guess see what i'm saying though yeah i've seen a man that's lost list what he says did you ever have the experience it's the most pitiful thing that you've ever seen when a man gets low lost he goes wild amen how many knows that's the truth he loves and loses his mind he goes insane he don't know where he's going what he's going you know and me and my wife are saying boys i would sure love to see if he's the son of god i wish somebody lead him to the lord huh right that's what the world needs they need the lord let me stop here for just a minute something else came to mind that says you know uh you know how people will ink themselves up right elena i was going to tell elena what would happen if you wrote all over yourself with a ink pen huh you might get a whipping right yeah she's nuts yes does mommy teach you not to write on your arms and hands does she she does yeah right our mom has taught us not to write on ourselves right we were taught not to write on ourselves but what are people doing today writing all over their self and not with the ink that can be rubbed off but permanent isn't that right and look how they're looking look what they're doing have you ever seen some i think i've might have showed the picture up here i'm not sure did i ever show you of some of the extreme people that even their eyeballs are black or i think it's black completely black and and if there's not a square inch in their face or body they you know they ink themselves yeah that's pretty much what a lost person looks like they're not happy with their self it's like but nana said about the boy i said he's not happy with yourself when you've got to do things like that you're not happy with yourself you have to change something woman not happy with long hair she'll cut it off huh it's a lost pitiful thing to see the lost world that we're living in amen not just women listen to men he goes wild he don't know where he's going he's caught in we caught a man out there a boy he had been lost in the woods and and he was thought he was a rancher and he was in the wrong territory and he got lost turned around and when they found him three days later he was running like a wild man screaming to the top of his voice his lips were all eat up he throwed his gun away huh think about it your only defense i don't know about if i had a little case of bullets or even if my remington was had 20 bullets in how you can shovel if i had about 22 bullets i i'd feel pretty safe hello i wouldn't be too scared but i have to be nuts to throw that away wouldn't you i don't know about you but you could eat pretty good okay i shoot a fish yes i would eat raw fish if i had to i'd try to stay away from the possum if i could but this boy his means of survival he threw it away because he lost his mind and that right that's what happens with people that lose your mind didn't brother bam say that the whole world would go completely insane yes you see people that are lost every day and it's very obvious that they are they've gone crazy amen the whole world is insane like i told john it says we're living in a generation but the man talked about the next generation that would be completely crazy amen so he says listen uh throat is gone he didn't know what to do and when his own brother he had to catch him and tie him and when his own brother come to him he fought him like an animal tried to bite him he didn't know where he was at why he was lost isn't that exactly what the world's shaping people are just in that shape they'll bite and devour one another they don't know where they're at they don't know who they are they know where they come from completely crazy gone mad the world has gone mad amen because why they left the guide they don't accept the guy they don't want a guy i can go out that well and i can do it go ahead find out whether you can you find out you can't you will get lost you are lost amen how many knows it's a second like brother branham thought i don't need i can do this you know that's the first sign that you're fixing to hit the wrong way right ain't about you but i can't even walk without him holding my hand lord i can't walk through this life i can't make it the rest of this way without him holding my hand i don't know about you but this morning but lord jesus i need you to guide me every day i need you to guide me lord through everything that's going on guide my thoughts lord help me to first think the right thoughts don't let me think on meditate and dwell on the things i shouldn't amen because it'll drive you crazy if you meditate on the wrong things amen if you think things are going to turn around you're going to go crazy because you're not so why even go there isn't that right but says it'll get worse and worse and worse until jesus comes and until the skies catch on fire the skies are gonna catch on fire one of these but days you glad listen now notice so he says and when a man's lost he's in a state of bewildered he don't know that he's in that state ask most of these people are you crazy why no i'm not crazy at all and you say no you've lost your mind you know they say no i lost they don't even know remember layout is here thou rich increased with goods have need of not nothing noah's not that they are wretched miserable poor blind and naked and no it's it not they're bewildered they don't know that they're in that condition they don't think they're in that condition but yet they are because let me tell you something if you ain't got the holy ghost you're not in your right mind nobody outside of the holy ghost is in their right mind and there's no telling what you'll do amen how many thankful for the holy ghost so is it when a man's lost from god he'll do things that the ordinary man would never do he'll do things beyond the thoughts of human being doing huh can i just preach what comes to mind back in the early 1900s if a woman would have went out there dressed like they do today the shales would have been full they would have arrested her now right they would have arrested her even for wearing pants huh or these mini skirts and think they arrested her they just said she's crazy huh prostitutes still wear miniskirts isn't that right they'd go out there and wear mini skirts while i was going through town today right there in front of the churches what was standing up front ready to go in women with tight jeans a garment that pertains to a man the bible says is an abomination in the sight of god you dress like a man you cross-dressing is what you're doing wasn't right back in the old days but now it's okay no it's not okay with god yet and men that are so feminist until they'll wear women's clothes amen all right there she was one with a mini skirt and one with with pants on them said well look there that's what it is how many knows what the holy ghost is doing with you and my me the bible says in revel let me show you what what god is leading us to where he has led us this will be kind of coming to a close but over revelations 18 how many knows that god leads his dear children along some through the water some through the fire some through the flood but all through the blood how many of these he's got one that one place that god leads us to all through is the blood of jesus christ and he leads us to calvary to a death to ourself amen amen i know i didn't there's different things i didn't want to didn't say talking about abraham coming out and saying leave your kindred leave your kin folks leave all of them come out here and be separate follow me but you sometimes you can't follow your family if you love your wife your brother your sister your husband if you love them more than you love god you're not ready to follow this guide you cannot be my disciples jesus said unless you're willing to forsake all and follow me don't even try to guess me to be your guide that's one of the first requirements jesus makes if i'm going to be your guide you better listen to what i tell you and you'll be willing to forsake all your ideas i don't need your input i know this woods backwards forwards i can walk these hills and mountains blindfolded okay i don't need your input how many believes that so that's the way it is folks if you had to have this guide amen and we're following him i'm at least we're following christ into all truth the opening of the seven seals revealing what the antichrist really is showing is exactly how dark it really is showing us the perils of this world and the mark of the beast and what it really is so that we don't what get caught in that storm so we don't get caught with the mark of the beast amen because how many knows denominationalism churches are the mark of the beast because they have all committed fornication and they have become the cage of every unclean and hateful world homosexuals are welcome in the church now lesbians are all welcome in the church now huh even to becoming preachers it's it's it's a terrible place and god is what does he what has he done he has sent an angel to call us out come out of her my people revelations 18 after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with his strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and it's become the habitation of devils the hold of every fowl spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird you can do anything you can be anything unclean and hate those that are good amen all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities amen so the call in this hour the word god has led us is to come out of denominationalism come out of anything that's contrary to the word of god because god is getting a bride ready to meet him in the air how many one of these days brother stephen god is going to lead us he is going to guide us into a body change and he's going to guide us into the skies to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord but before that happens god is getting us ready he's purifying a bride amen to where she is without spot and without wrinkle seeing that you look for such thing be diligent that to be found of him without spot amen or any such thing i mean it says lord help me lead me to that place to be spotless unspotted to the world don't care anything about the world only about one goal one ambition that is one of these days the lord is gonna come and he's gonna change my body we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them that are asleep amen but we'll change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen and so we're going to meet the lord in the air the wrath of god is going to be poured out upon the world the earth and they're going to be caught and they're going to perish because they didn't follow the guide the holy spirit is the guide he will guide you into all truth what is the mark of the people can't handle that they can't follow him there what's the mark of the beast amen what's all these things what's lukewarmness what's leodacia amen what's the truth of
