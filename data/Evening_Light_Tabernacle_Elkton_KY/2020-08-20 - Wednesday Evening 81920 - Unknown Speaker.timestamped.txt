[15:40] twas grace twas grace
[15:44] that talk god bless you
[15:54] grace be my
[15:57] face relieved
[16:04] how precious
[16:14] [Music]
[16:18] i first
[16:22] [Music]
[16:25] amen you remember when you first
[16:26] believed
[16:28] how much you meant to you how much the
[16:30] word meant to you how much
[16:31] living this life meant to you oh it
[16:34] should have never fade away
[16:36] every day that we serve him ought to be
[16:37] a better day it ought to be a more
[16:39] glorious day
[16:41] you say but you see all that's going on
[16:43] oh i see but god sees too
[16:45] and god knew that we would go through
[16:47] things god knew that
[16:48] we would battle through situations he
[16:51] knew sicknesses would be upon us
[16:53] he knew that the country would be so
[16:55] fearful of everything that they'd want
[16:57] to shut everything down
[16:59] but yet god picked us to live in this
[17:01] time
[17:02] and see i'm just the type person i get
[17:04] excited to know
[17:05] that god picked me to live in the
[17:07] hardest time he ever created
[17:09] he picked me to live in this time when
[17:11] the world would hate me
[17:12] he picked me when he knew that all of
[17:15] the tactics of the devil would be in
[17:17] foreplay
[17:18] he picked me to fight this battle and so
[17:21] you know what i tell you i just
[17:22] i just look sometimes and say god help
[17:25] me
[17:25] to be happy with what you've picked me
[17:27] to do help me
[17:29] to be satisfied with what you've picked
[17:32] me to fight in this day
[17:33] because i i'll be honest as a human i
[17:36] hate it
[17:36] i hate not being able to fellowship i
[17:38] hate not seeing everybody at church
[17:40] i hate seeing people that in contact
[17:43] with this and
[17:43] you got to be smart don't don't look
[17:45] down on you know i i was talking to
[17:47] somebody earlier this week i said you
[17:48] know when
[17:49] covet started there was message
[17:51] preachers that got up and
[17:53] and tried to twist a quote and tried to
[17:55] make it seem like the bride couldn't get
[17:58] coveted
[17:59] and now some of them's got covered what
[18:01] are they saying now
[18:03] it don't work that way see because covet
[18:05] is not a
[18:06] pandemic it's not a it's not something
[18:09] it's just something we're going through
[18:11] but yet the fear that's behind it is
[18:14] enraged by the devil himself
[18:16] and now i'm not saying don't be smart
[18:18] brother joseph says it this way
[18:20] i love the way he says it he said there
[18:21] is nothing wrong
[18:23] with mixing common sense with your faith
[18:26] there's nothing wrong with believing god
[18:28] to protect you
[18:29] but don't go fight the enemy on your own
[18:32] make sure you're doing what god's asked
[18:34] you to do and
[18:34] and i look at this time and i think god
[18:37] people are letting down
[18:38] all over the place because they're
[18:40] getting fear inside of them
[18:42] and it's washing their faith out but yet
[18:44] we know it's going to be a battle to the
[18:46] end
[18:47] and if we realize it's going to be a
[18:48] battle to the end then we need soldiers
[18:51] to stand up
[18:52] and say i'm ready to fight this battle
[18:54] i'm ready to stand for the word when
[18:56] nobody else will
[18:57] i'm ready when everybody wants to
[18:59] critique and they want to shut down
[19:01] and they want to say you're a bunch of
[19:03] fanatics i'm ready to stand up and say
[19:05] but i am the bride
[19:07] i am the one that he's coming to get and
[19:10] i'll tell you what i do i get to get
[19:11] excited thinking about it i
[19:12] i'm just this little country boy from
[19:14] middle tennessee and i don't know a
[19:15] whole lot
[19:16] but when he shows me something i get
[19:18] excited
[19:19] and so i thought tonight and and that i
[19:22] went back and forth on what to preach
[19:24] and and brother tom put me on the spot i
[19:26] thought i was going to have wednesday
[19:27] night off and
[19:29] here he is going to brother jewels and
[19:31] you know i send my prayers with him and
[19:33] brother joel and then my mind goes and i
[19:36] preach this message back at home a few
[19:37] months ago
[19:38] and i titled it scars of victory
[19:42] and i began to think as i would begin to
[19:44] think on this topic and i would begin to
[19:46] think
[19:47] god that's we need to look at what we're
[19:50] going through in a different light
[19:52] we don't need to look at it as
[19:53] depression we don't need to look at it
[19:55] as
[19:56] it's such a battle that i don't know if
[19:58] i can make it but we need to look at it
[20:00] that he can put nothing upon me
[20:02] that i can't overcome he knows my
[20:05] weaknesses he
[20:06] knows where i need help at he's not
[20:08] going to allow the devil to overtake me
[20:11] why
[20:11] because i am part of him so these scars
[20:14] that i have
[20:15] are actually scarrings of victory and i
[20:18] believe if we turn in the bibles the
[20:19] second corinthians and
[20:21] and i wrote down a little nod here i
[20:23] thought about jesus
[20:25] brother brandon said 33 year old and
[20:26] looked well beyond in his 50s
[20:29] why because he was battle scarred why
[20:31] because people would try to take him
[20:32] down people tried to accuse him people
[20:35] would try to
[20:35] tempt and people tried to kill him they
[20:37] tried to do everything
[20:38] he looked well beyond his age but he was
[20:41] still victorious
[20:42] even in death he was victorious second
[20:45] corinthians speak of paul
[20:47] and i want to refer this back to paul
[20:49] tonight if i can but second corinthians
[20:50] 12
[20:52] verse 6 through 10. paul's speaking of
[20:55] the thorn in his flesh
[20:57] paul's speaking of a scar that's in his
[20:59] life that he has to deal with on a daily
[21:01] basis
[21:03] and he said for though i would deserve
[21:05] glory i shall not be a fool
[21:08] for i will say the truth but now i
[21:11] forbid
[21:12] at least any man should think of me
[21:14] above which that he saith me to be
[21:16] or he that heareth of me at least i
[21:19] should be exalted above
[21:20] measure through the abundance of the
[21:22] revelations there was given to me
[21:25] a thorn in my flesh the messenger of
[21:28] satan
[21:29] to buffet me least i should be exalted
[21:33] above measure i thank god for a man of
[21:36] god like paul that can realize
[21:38] god is using me in a mighty way god is
[21:41] bestowing revelations upon me god is
[21:43] bestowing
[21:44] the truth of god is building his church
[21:47] upon the foundation of faith
[21:49] upon what i am going to be preaching to
[21:52] the people
[21:52] but yet if we're not careful the men and
[21:55] women are going to look to me
[21:57] so god allows the devil to buffet me and
[22:00] come against me he allows him
[22:01] to put a thorn in his flesh that i now
[22:04] not be exalted above measure
[22:06] for this thing i besolved the lord
[22:08] thrice that it
[22:10] might depart from me a man of god like
[22:13] paul goes and knocks on heaven's door
[22:15] three times
[22:16] brother says one time sitting in jail
[22:18] knocking on the door
[22:20] saying god why do i have to put up with
[22:22] this
[22:24] he said but he said unto me my grace
[22:28] is sufficient for thee paul whatever
[22:30] you're going through
[22:32] my grace is sufficient for you little
[22:34] bride
[22:35] whatever you're going through my grace
[22:38] is sufficient for you
[22:40] he said my body said my grace is
[22:42] sufficient for thee
[22:44] for my strength is made perfect in
[22:46] weakness
[22:48] god let me see it's not how strong i am
[22:51] but it's how strong it is
[22:53] it's about how i can humble down before
[22:55] his word
[22:56] and say god help me in the situation
[22:59] he said because he said my my strength
[23:02] is made perfect
[23:03] in weakness most gladly therefore
[23:07] what i rather glory in my infirmities
[23:10] that the power of christ
[23:12] may rest upon me paul's saying oh yeah
[23:15] i've got a thorn in my flesh i've got a
[23:17] scar
[23:17] but dear god i pray that i can be happy
[23:21] in what you've given me to deal with i
[23:23] can be happy
[23:24] in what you've given in my life in the
[23:26] scars in my life
[23:27] in the imprisonment in my life that i
[23:30] can have joy
[23:32] in what you've done for me whether i
[23:35] glory in my infirmities that the power
[23:37] of christ
[23:37] may rest upon me therefore i take
[23:40] pleasure
[23:42] in my infirmities in reproaches and
[23:44] necessities and persecutions
[23:46] and distresses for christ's sake
[23:50] for when i am weak then i am strong
[23:54] heavenly father lord you saw this night
[23:59] before the foundation of the world lord
[24:02] the numbers don't matter lord
[24:04] there's some that are viewing online
[24:06] that couldn't be here that would want to
[24:07] be here

[24:10] needs you see

[24:19] us tonight to let us know lord that

[24:23] been through no matter
[24:24] how many times i've been in this no

[24:31] rejoice and be glad
[24:33] in the situation that i'm in god i asked
[24:36] you tonight lord to
[24:38] allow me to yield myself to thee lord

[24:57] amen and you be seated and i thought of
[25:00] paul
[25:01] and i thought of a great man that paul
[25:03] was
[25:04] and how that paul himself as we know
[25:08] before the trip to the road to damascus
[25:11] he was known as saul and he was known as
[25:13] saul
[25:14] but he saw that man the old man was a
[25:17] persecutor of the very ones that loved
[25:19] jesus
[25:20] that he stood against him in all that he
[25:22] did that that he persecuted
[25:24] even unto death that he would go through
[25:26] he would hold the code of
[25:28] and watch them as they'd stone a man in
[25:30] the name of jesus and he would stand
[25:32] there
[25:33] and come against everything that was
[25:35] right
[25:36] but yet god knew something in him was
[25:38] him
[25:39] he knew there was a seed down in paul
[25:42] and god had to work for paul
[25:43] and i look at us i'm beginning to think
[25:46] you know most of our problems is
[25:48] from the youth as we go up and even in
[25:50] the middle age and even into the ill
[25:53] photos of the church we begin to think
[25:55] where our biggest problem lies is we
[25:58] can't get our minds off everything we
[26:00] used to do
[26:01] you know when we get together everybody
[26:02] wants to tell how big of a drunk they
[26:04] was or
[26:04] or how big of a gambler they was or or
[26:07] how big of a road racer they was they
[26:08] want to talk about
[26:10] the old man and the old sacrifice you
[26:12] know and then with scars in our lives
[26:14] that we'll never forget
[26:15] but yet god is not looking at them scars
[26:18] he's looking at that seed inside of
[26:20] every one of us
[26:21] that he's saying but they are my
[26:23] daughter they are my son
[26:25] they are who i've asked them to be
[26:28] see god don't look at it as failure as
[26:30] god looks at it as overcomings
[26:33] god don't look at it when you make a
[26:34] mistake and you get back
[26:36] up he don't look at it that you failed
[26:38] he looked at it that you overcome that
[26:40] situation
[26:41] that the devil placed something in front
[26:43] of you and yeah you may have stumbled
[26:45] and tripped
[26:46] you may have done something wrong but
[26:48] yet you had the strength inside of you
[26:50] to rise back up and say i'll keep
[26:53] marching on in your name lord
[26:56] what is it it's a scar of victory all of
[26:58] these scars in our life
[27:00] it makes us who we are it forms our
[27:03] character it forms our mind
[27:04] in the natural sense it makes us who we
[27:08] are in life it makes us a good manager
[27:10] or
[27:11] a good uh factory worker or a good truck
[27:13] driver or whatever it may be
[27:15] it makes us who we are but in the
[27:18] spiritual sense it's no different
[27:21] the things that paul went through here
[27:23] it made him who he was going to be
[27:26] it made him realize there is another
[27:28] side of this
[27:29] there's a more of a reason than ever for
[27:32] paul to stand for the truth
[27:34] because he knew the other side and in
[27:37] mind in your lives it's the same way if
[27:39] we look at it that way
[27:41] spiritually speaking most of us was
[27:43] raised under an
[27:44] under the correct doctrine of the church
[27:46] most of us raised in such a way in many
[27:48] years of our life
[27:49] we've been taught truth down through
[27:51] time we've been told the right way in
[27:53] the wrong way
[27:54] but you know what so many times we want
[27:56] to look back at all of our mistakes
[27:58] we want to look back at all of our
[28:00] failures and say oh god
[28:02] i can't do this but yet the very
[28:05] reason you have that scar is because
[28:07] that scar
[28:08] is going to guide you to what god has in
[28:10] store for you
[28:12] you realize if we quit looking at them
[28:15] as mistakes
[28:16] and start looking at them at victory how
[28:19] much more encouraged we could be
[28:21] no wonder paul could sit there and begin
[28:23] to say i'm not going to let it get me
[28:25] down no more
[28:26] i've prayed thrice to my father i've
[28:28] asked him to take this from me
[28:30] but every time god would look down and
[28:33] say but paul
[28:34] my grace is sufficient he's telling paul
[28:37] you've got a reason to be that way i've
[28:40] got you there for an idea
[28:42] i've got you in this condition for a
[28:44] reason
[28:45] or how many times we want god just to
[28:47] destroy everything in our past
[28:49] destroy everything in our mind look it's
[28:51] not going to be that what it's a
[28:53] remembrance of the failed you
[28:55] but what is it it's also a remembrance
[28:57] that you come from that
[28:58] and you're no longer who you used to be
[29:02] it's a victory in your life
[29:05] it's a victory in what you come from
[29:08] no one in brother brennan would refer to
[29:10] it and refer to the scripture and
[29:12] he would show us that paul would look
[29:14] into that bright light on the road of
[29:15] damascus
[29:16] and no doubt that affected his eyesight
[29:18] in such a way
[29:19] brother brennan would go back in several
[29:21] places and you'd say as paul got older
[29:24] he began to write in such big letters
[29:26] because he couldn't see his own writings
[29:28] what was it yeah it may have got paul
[29:31] down for a time
[29:32] it may have got me and you little down
[29:35] for a time
[29:36] but in reality it turned us back to the
[29:38] word of god and made us realize
[29:41] but this is what i overcome
[29:45] i want to read a little text it just so
[29:48] many of you probably heard it
[29:50] but i was reading the scribes reading it
[29:53] 1953
[29:55] palmer and locust got a running
[29:57] caterpillar
[29:58] brother brandon refers this story and it
[30:00] may be a little empty i'm not real
[30:01] i usually don't read a full quote but i
[30:03] want to read this it's on my heart
[30:05] brother branham's referring to his story
[30:07] and he said i remember one time
[30:09] i was reading the story where caesar was
[30:11] going to make a great parade
[30:14] and minnie was going to follow him and
[30:16] there he was
[30:17] sitting in his chair just riding down
[30:19] the street and when they did he stopped
[30:22] over there and he says
[30:23] i want to be with my officer tomorrow
[30:26] and to meet me here
[30:28] he says and i want that one honorable
[30:31] man to ride by my side in this great
[30:33] parade tomorrow
[30:35] and all of the officers and their trim
[30:37] to their plumes
[30:38] they polished their shields and
[30:39] everything that fixed up the big tags
[30:42] on them and so forth and they was
[30:44] passing by seizure
[30:45] each one of them with a big fine plume
[30:48] walking straight and sturdy passing by
[30:51] and caesar looked at them
[30:52] sitting there and after a while a little
[30:55] bitty old doughboy
[30:56] kind of looked like me huh he did a
[30:58] little round in the middle see little
[31:00] bitty old dough boy
[31:01] one of those little footmen come by and
[31:04] he was all cut and scratched and scarred
[31:06] and bruised
[31:08] and he passed by and just bowed his head
[31:10] and started to run off
[31:12] he felt so embarrassed standing there
[31:14] before the great emperor
[31:17] and he started to run away and directly
[31:20] the emperor said
[31:21] wait a minute he said who are you said
[31:24] come here he said yes my lord
[31:26] he walked up to him and he fell down
[31:28] like that and he raised up
[31:30] and he says my you're cut up awful said
[31:33] where did you get all of them scars and
[31:36] things
[31:38] and he said on the battlefield fighting
[31:41] for my lord
[31:43] i may not be the most elegant thing
[31:44] you've ever seen i may not be able to
[31:46] put four or five words together to make
[31:48] sense
[31:49] i may not be smart enough to confound
[31:51] anybody in a humanly flesh way
[31:53] i may not look good i may not be the
[31:55] handsome character that my wife thought
[31:57] i was
[31:59] but you know what god placed me here for
[32:02] a reason
[32:03] he placed me to be on the battlefield
[32:05] for the lord
[32:06] he placed me to take the scars that the
[32:09] devil would throw
[32:10] and stay in step with my lord he placed
[32:13] me here to
[32:14] fight until the end of my day
[32:17] he says what he said how'd that happen
[32:19] he said on the battlefield
[32:21] fighting for my lord
[32:24] lebron said he said you climb up here
[32:26] and you sit down he said you're the one
[32:29] that deserves it
[32:31] why because he had scars from the
[32:33] battlefields
[32:34] he didn't try to get out of temptation
[32:36] he didn't try to get out of the fight
[32:38] he faced the enemy on the front lines he
[32:41] stood for the word of god
[32:42] he stood for his lord he stood for his
[32:45] emperor
[32:46] he says it may cost me my arm but i'll
[32:48] stand for what i believe in
[32:50] i'll stand for the truth little
[32:53] christian little bride did not
[32:54] that's the ones that god are looking for
[32:56] he's not looking for the perfect and
[32:58] elegant that can hang his suit just
[32:59] right
[33:00] and they can walk down the line and look
[33:02] like he come out of the catalog
[33:03] no he's looking for a bride that's
[33:06] willing to stand on the front lines of
[33:07] the enemy
[33:08] and stand before god and say whatever
[33:11] you have devil
[33:12] i shall not stumble at the word of god i
[33:15] will fall
[33:16] not to your temptations why
[33:20] because these scars don't bother me no
[33:22] more devil
[33:23] you realize when you take a knocks at me
[33:25] that just shows how strong i am
[33:28] when you realize when you swing at me
[33:30] and you make contact and i lose an or
[33:32] i'm in the battle
[33:33] i'm not going to fall to what you have
[33:36] but i'm going to stand even so
[33:38] greater in my life why because i'm gonna
[33:40] look at you devil and i'm gonna tell you
[33:42] greater is he that's in me that's in the
[33:45] world
[33:47] and i've read the back of the book devil
[33:50] these scars ain't going to stay with me
[33:52] forever because i got a perfected body
[33:55] coming
[33:56] and when that body comes paul ain't
[33:58] going to have to worry about his outfit
[33:59] no more
[34:00] paul ain't going to have to worry about
[34:02] winning big letters anymore because
[34:04] his eyes are going to be made well some
[34:06] of us we're not going to have to worry
[34:08] about
[34:09] all of the games that we have that we
[34:11] fight day in day out with the devil
[34:13] of all of the mistakes we've done but
[34:15] we're going to be able to stand
[34:17] and say but by faith i have received
[34:20] righteousness in my lord's name
[34:23] the brethren goes on down and he says he
[34:26] says enough with your ddds
[34:28] he said i want to show some marks of the
[34:30] power of the gospel of jesus christ when
[34:34] i
[34:34] step forward brother says one day when i
[34:37] step forward
[34:38] i want to show the lord the scars that i
[34:40] have received on the battlefield
[34:42] i want to show him the time that i went
[34:44] overseas and the devil tried to give me
[34:46] a sickness
[34:47] i want to show him the many times that
[34:49] he would stand in line and pray for
[34:51] people and miracles happened around him
[34:53] and he was burping up ulcers from the
[34:55] inside of him he says
[34:57] i'm not going to let this overcome me i
[34:59] am going to stand through this scars
[35:01] i am gonna show the devil i have an
[35:03] overcoming power within me
[35:06] little bride god is looking for us
[35:08] tonight to be that one
[35:10] to be that one in 2020 that we live in
[35:14] when the world's falling apart why does
[35:16] it surprise us we know the world's going
[35:18] to fall apart
[35:19] they don't have a chance they turned
[35:21] down their savior they turned down the
[35:23] word of god
[35:24] they went the devil's way brother
[35:25] branham preached the message
[35:27] entitled it it's satan's eating they
[35:29] will live again
[35:33] don't let the devil discourage us and
[35:34] get us down this is an
[35:36] encouragement tonight to let us know
[35:38] we've read the
[35:40] back of the book we know what's going to
[35:42] happen the scars is just part of the
[35:44] trials
[35:45] it's just part of the tribulation it's
[35:47] just part of what we're going through to
[35:49] get there
[35:51] god give me the encouragement god give
[35:53] me the power
[35:54] to stand this place paul wood and look
[35:57] and say
[35:58] but he doesn't tell me his grace is
[35:59] sufficient i'm not going to even pray
[36:01] about it no more
[36:02] i want to stand on faith in what god
[36:05] gave me
[36:06] he set his grace to sufficient he said
[36:08] he wouldn't let nothing come upon me
[36:10] that i couldn't handle
[36:11] he said he would never see his righteous
[36:13] begging for bread
[36:14] he said that we would be gone before the
[36:17] first bomb
[36:17] fell i ain't going to stand on his word
[36:20] greater than i've ever stood on his word
[36:23] and when the devil enters this little
[36:24] mind
[36:26] because it is little and he enters this
[36:29] little mind
[36:30] and he begins to tell me oh but you've
[36:33] failed him so many times
[36:35] well devil let me tell you the rest of
[36:36] the story you know that time when you
[36:38] come into my life
[36:40] and you convinced me that smoking was
[36:42] all right and i went and took a
[36:43] cigarette and began to smoke
[36:45] yeah yeah that's the time i'm telling
[36:46] you jonathan i'm telling you
[36:48] well let me tell you the rest of that
[36:49] story god come down on our heart
[36:52] and condemn our heart that it wasn't
[36:54] right and i laid them things down and
[36:56] never went back to them
[36:57] why because i have an overcomer living
[37:00] side of me
[37:02] there will ever scar that you point at
[37:04] in my life i can give you an overcoming
[37:06] story
[37:07] when i'm looking at your life you look
[37:10] in your own heart and you look in your
[37:11] own life
[37:12] every situation in your life every time
[37:15] that you fail
[37:16] god every time that you've done
[37:17] something that you knew wasn't right
[37:19] god gave you a testimony of overcoming
[37:22] i look at me and like brother joel i
[37:25] look at men like brother ron
[37:27] you talk about black eyes how many black
[37:29] eyes have they given the devil
[37:31] the devil keeps punching them the devil
[37:33] keeps giving them scars
[37:34] the devil keeps giving them sicknesses
[37:36] but yet they gather their strength and
[37:38] they get back up
[37:39] and they say this is the word of god for
[37:42] her day
[37:43] this is the faith that i believe in you
[37:46] could take this body
[37:47] you can do whatever you want do with it
[37:49] but you're not changing the man on the
[37:51] inside
[37:52] see that's the faith that paul was
[37:54] giving us from the beginning
[37:56] paul was standing there from the
[37:57] beginning i take pleasure
[37:59] in my infirmities i take pleasure
[38:02] into all of our distresses i take
[38:05] pleasure
[38:06] in all of these things that i've done
[38:07] wrong
[38:09] hold up children tonight if we could
[38:12] look at ourselves that way
[38:14] if we could just you know i almost
[38:16] reached a message loosening god
[38:18] out of our box because you know what if
[38:21] we could get our mind
[38:22] and open the box and allow god to speak
[38:25] to us
[38:26] what he could do for us tonight nothing
[38:29] is impossible to the word of god
[38:31] nothing is impossible to our lord jesus
[38:33] christ
[38:38] but we are too busy looking at each
[38:41] other's in our own mistakes
[38:43] to allow god to move god comes down and
[38:46] he says
[38:47] he says i'll give you whatever you have
[38:49] need of well
[38:50] you know i believe that one time i'll
[38:53] get it right after i believe that i
[38:54] ain't
[38:55] the greatest trial of my life yep that's
[38:57] how it works
[38:59] because soon as you take a step here
[39:01] comes the devil
[39:02] as soon as you take a stand as soon as
[39:04] you stand up and say
[39:06] i believe in divine healing you might
[39:08] want to go take some vitamin c because
[39:10] something's coming your way
[39:12] you're fixing to be tested do you really
[39:14] believe that
[39:17] but you know what i don't care if i am
[39:18] sick i believe god is a divine healer
[39:21] i don't care if i die because with 19
[39:23] god is still a healer
[39:25] in our day god can still heal us just
[39:28] because i die doesn't take it away from
[39:30] god
[39:30] of what he can do
[39:35] god help us to see that we're living
[39:39] brother goes on down he says enough
[39:41] about your ddds i want to show some real
[39:44] marks of the power of the gospel of
[39:45] jesus christ when i stood forward yes
[39:48] sir
[39:49] he said take your stand he said yes sir
[39:53] show some scars you ain't had no
[39:57] testimony yet if you ain't got a scar
[40:02] you know there's a couple ways you can
[40:03] look at that i warned one brother one
[40:05] time he told me he said oh god
[40:07] he said brother ron's testimony of going
[40:09] through the fire i'd like to have that
[40:10] testimony i said i don't
[40:13] i don't want to burn like that i don't
[40:15] want that testimony
[40:17] but you know what each and every one of
[40:18] us has got our own scars and our lives
[40:21] we got our own things in our life that
[40:23] we failed we got our own things that we
[40:25] did
[40:26] we've got our own things that sometimes
[40:28] we didn't even fail god
[40:30] it was just something god put us through
[40:32] to reassure the foundation
[40:34] to solid up our foundation where we
[40:36] stood to let us know
[40:38] that we can trust him when the chips are
[40:40] down
[40:41] that we can't trust him
[40:44] you know what colby 19 is to me another
[40:48] test for god's children
[40:50] where are they going to put their faith
[40:53] the bride of christ how their faith is
[40:55] in the word
[40:56] well you don't know this family member's
[40:58] got it this family member's got it i got
[40:59] a cousin over here that died from it
[41:01] hey that's just symptoms of what it is
[41:04] you you realize all of us sitting in
[41:06] here the rapture don't take place
[41:08] it's very likely all of us are going to
[41:10] get sick and die or something
[41:13] hey let's just be honest we're not
[41:15] eternal beings
[41:17] these are flesh bodies some of us are
[41:20] going to die younger some of us are
[41:21] going to die older
[41:22] but you know what if the rapture don't
[41:24] take place the likelihood is great
[41:26] most of us in here will die of a
[41:28] sickness
[41:30] i didn't say be stupid and go hug the
[41:32] people that's got it
[41:34] see some of the devil's trying to tell
[41:35] one of you that right now
[41:37] no i'm saying youth coming says if my
[41:40] wife's got the flu
[41:41] i don't hang all over i put her in the
[41:43] bedroom and spray lots are at the door
[41:46] let's be honest let's use common sense
[41:48] here
[41:50] let's use a little bit of wisdom that
[41:51] god has given us and granted in our
[41:53] beings
[41:54] we we've dealt with things we've dealt
[41:56] with sicknesses we've dealt with
[41:58] flus we've dealt with pneumonias we
[42:00] failed with all kinds of things the
[42:02] devil has thrown out there
[42:04] why don't we let the last one why do we
[42:06] let one of the last ones get us so
[42:08] bothered
[42:08] and bother our faith so much that fear
[42:12] begins to creep into us it's just
[42:15] another scar that we could show the
[42:16] devil
[42:17] i overcome another trial that you laid
[42:19] before me
[42:20] another dart that you aim to the bride
[42:23] another weapon of destruction
[42:25] that you tried to destroy the bride look
[42:27] devil
[42:28] we overcome it again
[42:32] let me show you scar victory some of us
[42:35] message believers some of us that abroad
[42:39] has had it and may get it before it's
[42:41] over with
[42:42] and they're going to live through it and
[42:44] they're going to stand up and they're
[42:45] going to give a testimony
[42:46] god protected me when i was sick god
[42:50] gave me healing power
[42:51] when i needed the most
[42:56] he said well brother so-and-so is
[42:59] he his wife with stephen's wife you know
[43:02] he
[43:02] she come in contact with somebody you
[43:04] know no let's be smart let's
[43:06] stay away let's be smart but it ain't no
[43:09] reason
[43:10] for them to fear for their loss it ain't
[43:13] no reason
[43:14] to worry about what's going to happen
[43:15] because if he is living inside of you
[43:18] and you're born again it's just another
[43:20] scar that you can show the enemy
[43:22] i am that overcomer
[43:27] i am that bride that he
[43:30] so i just get a little excited sometimes
[43:31] i know
[43:33] i get real excited sometimes when i look
[43:35] at people
[43:37] they tell me they believe this message
[43:39] for 30 years for 40 years for 50 years
[43:42] and then they go oh god what are we
[43:44] going to do we're going to keep
[43:46] worshipping him
[43:47] we're going to keep praising him we're
[43:49] going to keep on
[43:50] singing the songs of god we're going to
[43:53] keep on listening to the tapes
[43:55] we're going to keep on reading our
[43:56] bibles we're going to keep on praying to
[43:59] our father
[43:59] we're going to keep on going to church
[44:01] when we can why
[44:02] because something inside of us desires
[44:05] to hear from god that's more important
[44:08] than anything i live for
[44:13] and one day i'm going to have the
[44:16] ability
[44:17] to stand with you and we're going to
[44:19] stand there before god
[44:21] and we're going to be battle scarred all
[44:23] up
[44:24] and god's going to look down and say yep
[44:27] that's my bride
[44:29] though i put her on the front line she
[44:31] stood for my word
[44:32] though i allowed the enemy to come with
[44:35] everything that he had
[44:36] though i allowed the devil to bring war
[44:39] against this nation like he's never
[44:40] brought it
[44:41] that i know i allowed the devil to bring
[44:44] in all the demonic powers he ever had
[44:46] control of
[44:47] and he brought him upon this age
[44:52] hey devil she's still standing
[44:55] because that's my bride that's the one
[44:57] that i molded after me
[44:59] that's the one i wanted from the very
[45:01] beginning of time
[45:02] that's the apple of my heart that's the
[45:05] one i give everything she has need of
[45:08] and though she's got scars in her life
[45:11] though she's been on the battlefield
[45:13] guess what she's standing victorious a
[45:15] bunch of
[45:16] earth that is burning with ashes why
[45:20] because i called her to be with me
[45:24] he realized brother said in several
[45:26] places and we're going somewhere else
[45:28] now but mother and said in several
[45:29] places
[45:30] the only thing that hinders god is your
[45:33] doubt
[45:35] is your unbelief that's the only thing
[45:38] that hinders
[45:39] brother brandon said in one place he
[45:41] says i'd rather have i don't know if
[45:43] i don't know the exact number don't
[45:44] quote me on it but you know what he said
[45:46] he makes a comment he said i'd rather
[45:47] have 10 or 12 truly born-again
[45:50] christians serving god than to have a
[45:53] church full
[45:54] of thousands why because he
[45:57] knew in that church full of thousands
[46:00] there was too many doubters sitting
[46:01] around that was hindering the moving of
[46:03] the spirit
[46:04] but he looked down in time and he looked
[46:06] down in air time
[46:07] and he could see churches spread across
[46:09] land i don't know if y'all pay attention
[46:11] but true message churches most of them
[46:14] are drilling in numbers
[46:16] why because it's a hard battle that
[46:18] we're in in 2020
[46:19] it's a hard battle that we're fighting
[46:21] in 2020 and only the fittest of the
[46:23] fittest it's going to come out
[46:28] you you can't make believe anymore
[46:32] look i realize brother brennan had a
[46:33] gift to discernment and could see your
[46:35] thoughts and see you
[46:36] see your mind and i thank god i don't
[46:38] have that because i'd go nuts
[46:40] but you know what even in his day
[46:44] there was people that surprised him when
[46:45] they turned out against him
[46:48] there was people that hurt him when they
[46:49] turned their back on him and walked away
[46:51] from him
[46:52] there was people that that would do that
[46:54] but yet they could go up to that very
[46:56] point
[46:57] with their suit on standing by the other
[46:59] prophet
[47:01] acting like they loved you you can't do
[47:03] that no more
[47:05] you're either for god or you're against
[47:06] him you're either going to stand for
[47:09] truth or you're going to go by the way
[47:10] of the wayside
[47:12] look i got family that ain't coming to
[47:14] church i ain't talking about yours i'm
[47:15] talking about mine
[47:16] i love mine to the very bed i had a
[47:18] conversation with my own mama this past
[47:20] weekend
[47:21] and was talking about different
[47:22] scenarios and and then possibly her
[47:25] dying before me and i said i'm not i'm
[47:26] not believing that
[47:28] and then i said it before i realized i
[47:30] said it but thank god that i
[47:32] just said it i said i'm going in a
[47:34] rapture where are you going to be
[47:38] then he said over there and started
[47:39] crying why
[47:41] because they know what the truth is
[47:44] they've left church
[47:45] they've left serving god the way they
[47:47] should but they know what the truth is
[47:49] and they can see in our lives that we're
[47:52] serving a living god
[47:53] and they realize this is the time that
[47:56] the bride is going to be made manifest
[47:59] this is the time through all of her
[48:01] scars through all of her stumblings
[48:03] through all of her failures
[48:05] she's gonna be the victorious one
[48:09] why because she just believes in him
[48:14] and she believes every need that i have
[48:16] is met in him
[48:19] so man if we don't get donald trump back
[48:22] in
[48:23] we're just going to fall to pieces huh
[48:25] if it's god's will for donald trump to
[48:27] get in he'll get in
[48:29] and as an individual as a human being
[48:31] i'll be happy
[48:34] but if it ain't god's will i don't want
[48:35] him in
[48:37] if it's god's will to bring a man in to
[48:39] put us in the desperation
[48:41] if that's what the bride needs then
[48:43] glory be to god
[48:44] let your will be done because i'm tired
[48:47] of fighting this battle
[48:48] i'm tired of running against the devil
[48:50] i'm ready to be
[48:51] that victorious one
[48:57] so they called me just a little
[49:00] background
[49:01] 1996 my granny passed away in
[49:05] in my life there's never been a more
[49:07] inspired woman
[49:08] in my life than my granny in 1996 i was
[49:12] not living for god
[49:13] i didn't want to live for god i was
[49:15] doing so many things against god that i
[49:16] don't even want to think about it
[49:19] but i remember coming to nashville to
[49:22] the hospital
[49:22] and seeing her on what day of the week
[49:26] it was exactly
[49:27] but we went home and that night is
[49:30] probably
[49:30] in my memory the first night i truly
[49:33] prayed before god that i truly cried out
[49:37] to god
[49:38] and that night's prayer changed the way
[49:40] i pray the rest of my life
[49:43] because i know that even though i was a
[49:46] sinner
[49:46] even though that i wasn't living right i
[49:49] knew that god was real
[49:51] i stood in a message church and i would
[49:53] watch my pastor brother curl
[49:55] stand and watch sicknesses fall off
[49:57] people watch
[49:58] miracles happen before my eyes i was i
[50:01] was not innocent to the fact
[50:03] that i saw god moving in my life god
[50:06] moving in the church i knew god could
[50:09] heal her
[50:11] but i also knew god had a perfect will
[50:14] and i will never forget i prayed that
[50:16] night i said dear god
[50:18] i says you can heal her
[50:23] but if it's not your will i don't want
[50:24] to see her like that again
[50:27] if it's not your will to heal her just
[50:29] take her own
[50:31] there's never been a woman i love my
[50:33] wife i'm not saying that
[50:35] i about said something not every gritty
[50:38] lady
[50:42] she was so influential in me
[50:46] even after her death i'd turn a bottle
[50:49] of alcohol up and i could hear her voice
[50:52] saying jonathan you know that's all
[50:54] right
[50:56] she meant so much to me but i come to a
[50:59] place that i had to realize
[51:01] it's god's will i didn't understand it
[51:04] then
[51:04] years later god give me understanding to
[51:07] it and now someone which is what i was
[51:08] getting at
[51:09] somebody called and said would you pray
[51:11] the brother so and so sister so and so
[51:13] that god would heal them of cancer i
[51:14] said this is the way i'll pray
[51:17] if it's their god's will for them to
[51:19] live god will take that sickness off of
[51:21] them
[51:22] but if it's not his will don't let me
[51:24] interfere with his will
[51:26] you realize so many times we interfere
[51:29] with the will of god
[51:31] you realize so many times maybe they
[51:33] need that score in their life
[51:35] maybe they need that situation in life
[51:38] maybe they need that
[51:39] sickness in their life to draw them to a
[51:42] rapturing faith
[51:43] to draw them to a place that they can
[51:45] become victorious
[51:47] i pray every prayer that i prayer that i
[51:49] pray i say dear god
[51:51] don't let my prayer change your perfect
[51:54] will
[51:55] if this is you moving in this situation
[51:58] i pray that you continue your way
[52:00] but god if it's the enemy trying to
[52:02] destroy my brother and sister
[52:04] i'm going to cast it out of them because
[52:06] they have no right to be with my family
[52:10] but you know what
[52:14] we need to look and decide
[52:18] is this battle worth
[52:21] we need to weigh the options and realize
[52:23] that we're living in a time now
[52:26] that we're living in a time that's going
[52:28] to be the hardest far look
[52:29] it ain't going to get better tomorrow if
[52:32] trump gets elected next year it ain't
[52:34] gonna get better
[52:36] they're gonna come after him harder than
[52:38] they've ever come after him
[52:39] they're gonna come after you and i
[52:41] harder than they've ever come after us
[52:43] they're gonna try to shut the doors of
[52:45] the church until they succeed
[52:46] in whatever fashion it is they're going
[52:49] to do it why
[52:50] we have a prophecy we know what's going
[52:52] to happen in the end time
[52:54] but let's julian don't let that get us
[52:56] discouraged
[52:57] don't let the scars of what they're
[52:59] doing to us but the persecutions and the
[53:02] love
[53:02] don't let that take the limelight but
[53:04] instead stand back as paul did and say
[53:07] i take pleasure in the fact that you're
[53:10] going to close my church doors
[53:12] because what are you doing you're
[53:13] fulfilling prophecy
[53:15] you're drawing me closer to going home
[53:18] with my husband
[53:21] we need to encourage ourselves we need
[53:23] to stand up it's been united more than
[53:25] we've ever stood before
[53:27] united with the word of god and say here
[53:29] we are
[53:30] you enemy i'm not taking it no more i'm
[53:33] standing on the word of god
[53:34] i am showing you i will be victorious
[53:39] though you may score my life though you
[53:42] may throw
[53:42] darts of of sicknesses though you may
[53:45] throw
[53:45] darts of all of these thoughts i ain't
[53:48] going to stand for what i believe in
[53:50] i am going to stand this ball here and
[53:52] say though i'm dying in a prison cell
[53:55] though you can do this though you can do
[53:57] that though you can do all of these
[53:59] things
[53:59] i am going to stick with what god has
[54:01] shown me to do
[54:05] you realize i use it in this early
[54:07] school class sometimes
[54:09] but you realize that every testimony we
[54:13] have down through time
[54:14] we can take anyone we ain't got enough
[54:16] time to go all night
[54:17] but we could take david we could take
[54:19] daniel we could take the hebrew children
[54:20] we could take
[54:21] samson we could take any one of them and
[54:24] you
[54:24] realize there had to be something to
[54:26] come into their life
[54:28] to bring them to a point of desperation
[54:30] to bring them to a point
[54:32] of do i believe it or not
[54:35] and there was pain that come with that
[54:37] and there were sacrifices that come with
[54:39] that
[54:39] do you realize if daniel would have
[54:41] never stayed in his closet and prayed
[54:44] before god
[54:44] they would have never thrown him in the
[54:46] lion's den
[54:48] and most places church girls can hey man
[54:50] he should have done that
[54:52] no he shouldn't have done that he should
[54:54] have stayed with the word of god
[54:56] and let man take him away from what he
[54:58] believed in
[54:59] why because god knew the whole time
[55:02] daniel will stand for my word
[55:04] and i'll stand for daniel when they
[55:07] throw him in the lion's den
[55:08] i'll shut the mouths of the lions
[55:13] think about abraham i try to find flesh
[55:17] clothes
[55:18] i ain't touching notes i think about
[55:22] abraham and sarah
[55:25] you realize the very god
[55:29] that we serve many of us by faith and
[55:32] i don't want to say nobody has seen him
[55:34] but
[55:35] we've not seen the flesh man in our life
[55:39] and we see that he comes and he visits
[55:42] abraham and sarah
[55:44] and when he comes and visits them he
[55:45] gives them a promise
[55:48] of a son and he says you're going to
[55:51] have a son of many nations
[55:54] and then he goes on your seeds like the
[55:56] stars and he gives him this promise and
[55:59] if we go and we read the scripture in
[56:01] genesis and exodus and we begin to
[56:04] dissect the life of abraham
[56:07] abraham failed god many times
[56:11] he said well abraham prayed the prayer
[56:13] of faith
[56:14] abraham was granted righteousness by his
[56:16] faith
[56:17] that's what romans says but if we look
[56:21] at the life
[56:22] he didn't have a perfect life he allowed
[56:26] his wife to convince him to take on a
[56:27] handmaid
[56:28] to have a son that way he allowed
[56:31] thoughts to enter his mind he allowed
[56:33] oh an old man like me have a child he
[56:35] led these things
[56:36] as a human all of these things scarred
[56:39] his vision and scarred his life
[56:44] yet in romans when we go to romans 4
[56:46] believe it is and we could find as they
[56:48] would begin
[56:49] to describe how god looked at abraham
[56:53] and see tonight so many of us we've got
[56:55] all these scars that we can look at in
[56:57] our life we've got
[56:58] all of these situations that we can find
[57:00] in our life we got all this that we want
[57:02] to look at
[57:03] but if we could ever look the way god
[57:05] looks at his bride
[57:07] trust me okay this is probably going to
[57:10] get me in trouble
[57:14] that's my bride
[57:17] i would love to tell you she's perfect
[57:20] but she's not
[57:24] she differences in my opinion sometimes
[57:27] and it roused this flesh
[57:28] up because she should agree with
[57:31] everything that i say
[57:33] no she's a human raised by a different
[57:37] set of parents
[57:38] with a different set of opinions
[57:41] i didn't say she butted against headship
[57:43] she's a wonderful wife
[57:45] and she knows who her head is and i know
[57:48] who my head is
[57:50] see so many people forget the end of
[57:52] headship well my wife's going to do what
[57:54] i say do and that's just how
[57:56] you're going to do what god says do
[57:58] because headship goes a little higher
[58:03] but she even reminds me sometimes
[58:06] herself
[58:07] i said baby dog you're perfect she goes
[58:09] no if i was perfect i wouldn't be here
[58:12] yeah you're right you're right if we
[58:16] ever reach perfection we can't stay here
[58:17] any longer
[58:20] but what i'm getting at is if we quit
[58:23] looking at our own mistakes and our own
[58:26] failures
[58:26] and think oh i'm just a nobody
[58:30] no in god's eyes
[58:34] you're his bride and let me tell you all
[58:37] that i just said about her
[58:38] in my eyes there's no better wife than
[58:41] that not there
[58:43] i don't care what you're saying you'll
[58:45] never convince me
[58:47] there's a better wife than that one and
[58:49] your brother is going to feel the same
[58:50] way about your wives
[58:53] you treat her right she'll treat you
[58:54] right
[58:57] but god looks at his bride and he don't
[59:00] see her scars
[59:02] he don't see her mistakes
[59:06] when you fell down at an altar and you
[59:07] ask god to forgive you
[59:09] he put it out of his mind and though
[59:12] abraham
[59:13] abram had many mistakes romans 4 we find
[59:16] the scripture
[59:18] even brother branham and god's power to
[59:20] transform in 65
[59:22] brother branham the prophet in our day
[59:24] would make this comet he said abraham
[59:26] didn't take the scientific research of
[59:28] his day and say i'm too old to have a
[59:30] baby i went too far
[59:32] i wonder why he threw that in there how
[59:35] many times you hear children of god say
[59:36] that well i've gone too far
[59:38] you ain't going too far
[59:42] he said i've done this and that in the
[59:44] other wall it sounds just like all of us
[59:46] don't it
[59:47] but he called anything that was contrary
[59:50] to god's word
[59:51] as though it wasn't and he staggered
[59:54] not at the promise of god through
[59:57] unbelief
[59:58] but he was strong giving praise to god
[1:00:00] he knoweth that god was able to perform
[1:00:03] that which he had promised
[1:00:06] romans 4 is the scripture brother
[1:00:07] brenham took that from and based that
[1:00:09] upon
[1:00:10] as a prophet of god as a seer of the
[1:00:12] word he could see how god
[1:00:14] saw abraham who against
[1:00:18] chapter 4 verse 18 who against hope
[1:00:20] believed in hope
[1:00:23] and we need some believers of hope in
[1:00:25] this day
[1:00:27] look look i i believe in using the bible
[1:00:31] to look at us in the day that we're
[1:00:33] living in
[1:00:34] it's not good enough just to talk about
[1:00:36] abraham and talk about paul
[1:00:38] and talk about how they felt and how
[1:00:40] they live but it's good enough to look
[1:00:41] at that and realize
[1:00:43] that is speaking to you and i it's
[1:00:46] speaking in a day
[1:00:47] there was no hope but yet he could
[1:00:49] believe in hope why
[1:00:51] because there was a bride coming in 2020
[1:00:53] when you would look at the forecast of
[1:00:55] the world
[1:00:56] it looks like no hope but yet she can
[1:00:59] believe in hope
[1:01:02] that he might become the father of many
[1:01:04] nations
[1:01:05] according to that which was spoken so
[1:01:07] shall i see it be
[1:01:08] and being not weak in faith
[1:01:12] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:01:15] and he was about a hundred years old
[1:01:16] neither yet at the deadness of sarah's
[1:01:19] womb
[1:01:20] and he staggered not at the promise of
[1:01:23] god
[1:01:24] but but wait but wait we read in the
[1:01:27] scripture we could go back and we could
[1:01:28] go back to
[1:01:29] exodus here i think i've got to go down
[1:01:31] and we could find what he took on hagar
[1:01:36] in the flesh eye that looks like he
[1:01:38] failed
[1:01:39] there was a scar in his life
[1:01:43] but yet something moved inside of him
[1:01:46] and allowed him to know you know what
[1:01:49] that wasn't right that's not the
[1:01:52] promised son
[1:01:54] god said that abraham and sarah would
[1:01:57] have a son
[1:01:58] the promises unto me and sir and he
[1:02:01] would get back and he would repent
[1:02:03] before god
[1:02:05] and when he repented god forgot that he
[1:02:07] done it
[1:02:09] when you repent god forgot that you've
[1:02:12] done it
[1:02:13] the problem is is everybody sitting
[1:02:14] around you didn't forget neither
[1:02:17] the problem is you know my my gradient
[1:02:20] shirley jones she passed away
[1:02:23] i guess eight years ago something like
[1:02:24] that she's riding down the road one day
[1:02:27] and
[1:02:27] now you see them everywhere but they was
[1:02:29] just coming out the little
[1:02:30] the little um gas company putting a
[1:02:33] little sign out
[1:02:34] so before you dig call call uh before
[1:02:36] you did call this number to make sure
[1:02:38] they're in a gas line right
[1:02:40] and she's seen it inspiration struck and
[1:02:42] she printed this thing out
[1:02:44] and she placed it on the front of her
[1:02:45] house and she told testafol did it
[1:02:47] it said before you dig in my past you
[1:02:49] better call god
[1:02:52] you better make sure he hadn't already
[1:02:53] removed that you better make sure that
[1:02:56] he hadn't already took that away from me
[1:02:58] you better make sure that i haven't
[1:03:00] already fell on my knees
[1:03:02] and asked god and forgiveness to move
[1:03:04] that from my life
[1:03:06] you know as christians we all take that
[1:03:08] to heart sometimes
[1:03:09] we ought to look at each other and go i
[1:03:11] don't know their prayer life
[1:03:12] i don't know where they're at i know
[1:03:14] they've made mistakes but oh god
[1:03:16] i've made mistakes i've asked you to
[1:03:18] forgive me if you can forgive me
[1:03:20] you can forgive them let's get together
[1:03:22] and push towards a victory
[1:03:29] and being not weak in faith considered
[1:03:32] his own body was now dead he was about
[1:03:34] 100 years old neither with the deadness
[1:03:36] of sarah's room
[1:03:37] but he staggered not
[1:03:40] at the promise of god
[1:03:44] through unbelief but was strong
[1:03:47] in faith that don't look like strong in
[1:03:51] faith to me nothing i mean my goodness
[1:03:53] he let his wife convince him to take on
[1:03:55] another woman
[1:03:57] he'll look very strong to me
[1:04:00] but yet though he made a mistake
[1:04:03] that we failed
[1:04:07] faith throws up inside of him but that's
[1:04:10] not the promise
[1:04:14] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:04:15] through unbelief but was strong in
[1:04:17] faith giving glory to god
[1:04:21] and being fully persuaded that he had a
[1:04:24] promise that he was able
[1:04:27] to perform it and therefore it was
[1:04:30] imputed to him righteousness
[1:04:32] now it was written for his sake alone it
[1:04:34] was imputed to him
[1:04:36] for us also to whom it shall
[1:04:40] be imputed if we believe on him that
[1:04:43] raised up
[1:04:44] jesus our lord from the dead who was
[1:04:46] delivered from our offenses
[1:04:47] who was raised again for our
[1:04:49] justification
[1:04:52] what didn't tell us if we never made a
[1:04:56] mistake and we was perfect human beings
[1:04:58] look even the angels wasn't perfect a
[1:05:00] third of them fell from heaven
[1:05:02] we need to get we need to get how we
[1:05:04] define perfection out of our heads
[1:05:07] we need to get this this this lost cause
[1:05:10] of achieving perfection out of our heads
[1:05:14] you never as long as you're living in
[1:05:16] these flesh bodies
[1:05:17] you're never not gonna have a bad
[1:05:19] thought
[1:05:21] you're never not going to say something
[1:05:23] that you wish you shouldn't have said
[1:05:25] now look as you go closer to god things
[1:05:27] fall off look
[1:05:28] look it was a devil in a nicotine
[1:05:31] that fought me for years but yet when i
[1:05:34] began to grow closer to god i don't
[1:05:36] fight that devil no more
[1:05:37] but there's another devil that i fight
[1:05:40] along the way of this battlefield
[1:05:42] along the way of this army that i'm
[1:05:44] riding in that i'm walking in
[1:05:46] there's another battle ahead of me
[1:05:48] there's another stepping stone ahead of
[1:05:50] me
[1:05:51] it's not going to get any better until i
[1:05:53] go into a rapture
[1:05:58] but i've learned that when god looks
[1:06:01] down and he sees me
[1:06:04] he don't see the time that i got upset
[1:06:06] at my wife
[1:06:07] why because when i did i made it right
[1:06:09] with her and i made it right with him
[1:06:12] he don't see the times that i stubbed my
[1:06:14] toe and said a word that i shouldn't say
[1:06:18] thank god i ain't done that in a while
[1:06:20] i've finally won that battle
[1:06:25] it is being honest tonight so many times
[1:06:28] preachers don't want to be honest
[1:06:30] we're human too i got scars on my
[1:06:33] fingers that hurt when they happen
[1:06:35] i gotta cut right there that i cut a
[1:06:37] nerve and i touch the end of that finger
[1:06:38] and i grinch with pain
[1:06:40] when i step the razor blade up into that
[1:06:42] and it stuck in the bone and i had to
[1:06:44] pull it out of bone
[1:06:45] it hurts
[1:06:49] if i thought it would help to curse
[1:06:51] something i would have cursed
[1:06:53] but thank god he's there with me
[1:06:56] every day of my life thank god that in
[1:06:59] my trials
[1:07:00] he's there with me when i need him the
[1:07:03] most
[1:07:04] thank god that when i do fall before him
[1:07:07] i have a promise that i can fall on my
[1:07:10] knees
[1:07:10] and i can say dear god forgive me
[1:07:15] he says well done my son
[1:07:18] you never done it in the first place
[1:07:22] i've put it out of my memory i look at
[1:07:25] you
[1:07:27] and one day as abraham was imputed
[1:07:29] righteousness
[1:07:31] he's going to look down at a bride and
[1:07:32] he's going to say and she staggered
[1:07:36] not at the promise of god well brother
[1:07:39] what do you promise you're talking about
[1:07:41] a rapture that's going to take a bride
[1:07:43] out of here
[1:07:44] i didn't say i could explain it i didn't
[1:07:46] tell you that i know the time because i
[1:07:48] don't
[1:07:49] but i know i have a promise that in the
[1:07:52] days that i live in
[1:07:54] this world is coming to an end brother
[1:07:57] brandon said people would go totally
[1:07:59] insane would you agree they've gone
[1:08:00] totally insane
[1:08:02] let's define the police well what sense
[1:08:04] does that make
[1:08:06] the only thing keeping us from different
[1:08:08] from a third world country is the police
[1:08:10] on the streets keeping law
[1:08:12] and we want to defend we want to fund
[1:08:14] them yet that makes a lot of sense
[1:08:17] we're going to march with our cause and
[1:08:20] we're going to tell us to defund the
[1:08:21] police
[1:08:22] and then they called the police and
[1:08:24] asked them to protect them
[1:08:28] we've lost our minds
[1:08:32] we're living in a time of insanity
[1:08:35] but that don't get me down that gets me
[1:08:38] excited
[1:08:40] because brother benham said there'll
[1:08:41] come a day before they'll lose their
[1:08:43] mind
[1:08:44] they'll go totally insane and i go oh
[1:08:47] dear god we're living in that time
[1:08:49] there ain't much after this we're about
[1:08:52] to die somebody told me that they said
[1:08:54] well i can't say that it's no closer to
[1:08:56] the end time today than it was a hundred
[1:08:58] years ago
[1:08:58] oh thank god for i said because if you
[1:09:01] can't see it you're blind
[1:09:03] to what god is doing for his bride
[1:09:05] you're
[1:09:06] blind to know what he's doing for her
[1:09:09] right this
[1:09:10] instant i have a promise
[1:09:15] i got a message god laid on my heart and
[1:09:17] i'm trying to
[1:09:18] study through it with god i'm going to
[1:09:20] title it and i'll preach it here
[1:09:22] sometime
[1:09:23] but i have a promise there is a land
[1:09:28] there is a land there is a land that's
[1:09:33] as we done got carried away and went too
[1:09:35] far in time
[1:09:37] that when we see jesus come back he's
[1:09:39] not going to have nails guard hands
[1:09:42] he did that in the flesh body for you
[1:09:44] and i
[1:09:46] we're not going to see that we're going
[1:09:48] to see a perfected man of god
[1:09:51] when i look at you when you look at me
[1:09:54] you're not going to see my mistakes
[1:09:56] the things that that i use to illustrate
[1:09:59] of my failures that
[1:10:00] that you could see that oh brother
[1:10:02] jonathan's done this and brother
[1:10:03] jonathan you're not going to see that
[1:10:04] anymore
[1:10:06] i have a promise and one day
[1:10:11] through all of these scars i'm going to
[1:10:14] stand on that battlefield
[1:10:16] and that road is going to be called up
[1:10:18] yonder
[1:10:19] and i'm going to step out of line and
[1:10:20] say did y'all hear that
[1:10:22] he just said my name
[1:10:25] even so lord come quickly
[1:10:29] david if you come if you would stand
[1:10:31] with us
[1:10:34] appreciate brother tom asking me to come
[1:10:38] remember when i first started
[1:10:40] ministering
[1:10:41] man if i went somewhere to minister and
[1:10:43] the pastor wasn't there i was so
[1:10:44] nervous it wasn't funny it ain't got
[1:10:47] much better
[1:10:49] i like having the pastor in my corner
[1:10:51] the pastor
[1:10:53] is the shepherd of the chief
[1:10:56] i want y'all to know i would never try
[1:10:59] to say anything contrary to what your
[1:11:00] pastor said
[1:11:02] because god gave him to you to perfect
[1:11:05] you
[1:11:07] he gave him to this congregation to
[1:11:09] perfect
[1:11:11] you and if you turn that down
[1:11:15] you're turning down the word of god
[1:11:18] where does that put us
[1:11:20] god tonight
[1:11:23] help each and every one of us to look at
[1:11:26] our
[1:11:27] failures to look at our scars different
[1:11:30] than we've ever looked at them
[1:11:34] yeah i failed the devil
[1:11:39] let me tell you the rest of the story
[1:11:42] when you knocked me down it got me to a
[1:11:45] place of humility
[1:11:47] and i fell on my knees and i cried out
[1:11:50] to my true father
[1:11:52] and you know what devil he don't treat
[1:11:54] me the way you do
[1:11:56] when i make a mistake he don't cast me
[1:11:58] out
[1:12:00] he opens his arms he said i forgive you
[1:12:05] and so devil let me tell you that scar
[1:12:08] you gave me
[1:12:09] every time i look at it i go yeah
