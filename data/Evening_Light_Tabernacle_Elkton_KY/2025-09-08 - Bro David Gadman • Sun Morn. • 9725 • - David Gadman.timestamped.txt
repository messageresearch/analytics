[1:03:44] the weather. I mean, I I talked to your
[1:03:48] pastor yesterday and told him, you know,
[1:03:50] I appreciate him for all the prayers
[1:03:51] he's, you know, had for me. He just I
[1:03:55] was in the hospital twice this year, you
[1:03:59] know, nothing that I wanted wanted to do
[1:04:01] but and saw that you know him. Amen. So,
[1:04:04] but I I appreciate him and you know I
[1:04:06] appreciate the Lord touching me. Amen.
[1:04:09] And just hear about what was it been
[1:04:11] about a month or ago, a little over a
[1:04:13] month, five weeks ago, I had uh 10
[1:04:15] inches of my colon taken out. But you
[1:04:17] know, God's been merciful. He's been
[1:04:19] great to us. And I I appreciate his
[1:04:21] healing touch. Amen. Could have been
[1:04:23] worse. the things that we've been
[1:04:25] through. But hey, I tell you what, God's
[1:04:27] been merciful to us and we're so
[1:04:28] grateful for that. Amen. So, I greet you
[1:04:31] all in the name of the Lord this
[1:04:33] morning. Trust that everybody's doing
[1:04:35] well. My pastor, Brother Homer Longoria,
[1:04:37] he sends his greetings. Amen. To Brother
[1:04:40] Tom and just different ones, the church.
[1:04:42] Amen. So, we appreciate Brother Homer.
[1:04:45] Amen. So, you just pray for us this
[1:04:47] morning. I may not be myself this
[1:04:49] morning. Just trying, you know, like I
[1:04:50] said, just trying to get my strength and
[1:04:52] everything back. But we do trust in him
[1:04:55] this morning and trust that he has
[1:04:57] something for each and every one of us
[1:04:59] this morning. Amen. You believe that
[1:05:01] this morning? I believe it with all my
[1:05:03] heart. Amen. So, if you have your Bibles
[1:05:06] this morning, turn with me to the book
[1:05:08] of Psalms, the 23rd chapter this
[1:05:11] morning.
[1:05:12] Like I said, I greet each and every one
[1:05:15] of you in the name of the Lord this
[1:05:16] morning. I guess this is my water. Amen.
[1:05:19] And if it ain't, we'll just, you know,
[1:05:20] praise the Lord, we just drink after one
[1:05:22] another. Amen. Brother Bram said, we
[1:05:24] ought to get so close we'd be able to
[1:05:25] chew one another's gum. Is that right?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let me be the first one to
[1:05:30] chew it.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] So, but anyway, we ought to be in that
[1:05:39] much in love with one another, though.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms the 23rd chapter. We'll
[1:05:47] look at the first well, we'll we're
[1:05:49] going to read all these verses. And
[1:05:50] every one of us should know this by
[1:05:52] heart. I learned it when I was a little
[1:05:55] uh boy in Sunday school. And we had to
[1:05:57] say it. I was going to uh United
[1:06:00] Pentecostal Church. And at sun on Sunday
[1:06:03] afternoon, Sunday nights, Sunday evening
[1:06:05] service, they had what they call
[1:06:06] children's church. And they said, and
[1:06:09] this was during the Easter time, they
[1:06:10] said if we
[1:06:12] uh could memorize Psalms 23, we'd get
[1:06:15] something. Well, I memorized it and I
[1:06:17] got something and I ain't gonna tell you
[1:06:19] what I got because I'm kind of
[1:06:20] embarrassed of what it wasn't nothing
[1:06:23] bad. It just Well, you know, ask me
[1:06:26] after church and I may tell you.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Psalms the 23rd chapter. Amen. You love
[1:06:32] the Lord this morning. You appreciate
[1:06:34] him.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
[1:06:38] not want." That word actually means
[1:06:40] lack. I shall not lack. He maketh me to
[1:06:44] lie down in green pastures.
[1:06:47] He leadth me beside the still waters.
[1:06:51] He restoth my soul. He leadeth me in the
[1:06:54] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:06:56] sake. Yay, though I walk through the
[1:06:59] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[1:07:01] fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy
[1:07:04] rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou
[1:07:08] preparest a table before me in the
[1:07:10] presence of my enemies. Thou anointest
[1:07:12] my head with oil, my cup runth over.
[1:07:16] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:07:18] me all the days of my life, and I will
[1:07:21] dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. How many's got a need this
[1:07:26] morning?
[1:07:28] Kind heavenly father, Lord, we just love
[1:07:32] you this morning. We just appreciate you
[1:07:33] so much for your mercy and your goodness
[1:07:35] to us, Lord, for allowing us once again
[1:07:38] to be able to come into your presence,
[1:07:40] Lord, with brothers and sisters of like,
[1:07:42] precious faith. And Father, we just ask,
[1:07:45] oh God, that you just help us this
[1:07:46] morning. Lord, I pray, Lord, that I can
[1:07:49] get myself out of the way and you just
[1:07:51] speak to us this morning
[1:07:53] by your word. Lord, I pray, Father, that
[1:07:56] you just touch each and everyone here
[1:07:59] this morning, Father. You saw the hands,
[1:08:01] Lord. You know what was behind each and
[1:08:03] every hand before it was raised. So,
[1:08:06] Father, we just ask, oh God, that you
[1:08:07] just help us this morning to get
[1:08:10] ourselves out of the way. And you just
[1:08:11] use us, Lord, this morning as you see
[1:08:14] fit, Father.
[1:08:16] Lord, we just love you. We just
[1:08:18] appreciate you so much, Father. We just
[1:08:20] ask, oh God, that you just minister to
[1:08:22] each and every one of us. You saw the
[1:08:24] hands, you know the needs, Father. Lord,
[1:08:27] you're a God that can meet each and
[1:08:28] every need this morning. Whether it
[1:08:30] whatever the need would be, Father,
[1:08:32] Lord, your hand not too short that you
[1:08:34] can't supply, Father. Lord, every need
[1:08:38] that's represented here this morning, we
[1:08:40] just ask that you do it, Lord. May you,
[1:08:43] Lord, move us aside this morning, Lord,
[1:08:45] and speak to us through your word,
[1:08:47] Father. Lord, I'm just a yielded vessel
[1:08:50] to you this morning, Father. I pray,
[1:08:51] Lord, that you just use me. Help me,
[1:08:54] Father, as I yield myself to you, Lord.
[1:08:56] I just lord like that song. I just give
[1:08:58] myself away. Lord, may I give myself
[1:09:00] away this morning that you can use me,
[1:09:02] Father. Help me, Father. Lord God. And I
[1:09:06] pray, Lord, you'd help each and every
[1:09:08] one of us. We know in your scripture,
[1:09:09] Lord, you said that Lord
[1:09:12] that the word when it goes out, it will
[1:09:14] not return back void. For when it goes
[1:09:16] out, it accomplish what it is sent to
[1:09:18] accomplish what the purpose is for it
[1:09:20] this morning. May you do that this
[1:09:22] morning, Father. It's a promise, Lord.
[1:09:24] And you never backed down on your word.
[1:09:26] You never you never uh uh uh uh welched
[1:09:29] on any promise, Lord. But you always
[1:09:31] kept your word. And Father, we believe
[1:09:33] you'll keep it this morning. Father,
[1:09:36] grant it to us this morning. We ask all
[1:09:39] these things in the lovely name of Jesus
[1:09:41] Christ. And God's people said,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; you may be seated this morning.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love them this morning.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; You appreciate them, sir.
[1:09:54] Psalms 23. We read it. And I I' I've
[1:09:58] I've looked over this many times here.
[1:10:01] And and I like Psalms. I like the
[1:10:04] Psalms. I like uh most of it was written
[1:10:07] by David. And I appreciate David this
[1:10:10] morning. You believe that this morning?
[1:10:13] I believe he was a the B Well, the
[1:10:15] Bible, even the prophet of God said he
[1:10:16] was a man after God's own heart.
[1:10:19] He was a man that he never did let
[1:10:21] anything uh get by him and he always
[1:10:24] trusted in God and he had a spirit of
[1:10:26] quick repentance. Anything he done
[1:10:29] wrong, he was quick to repent of that.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? And I I
[1:10:34] want to be like David.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And so here we read here in Psalms the
[1:10:39] 23rd chapter that we read that that he
[1:10:42] said, "The Lord is my shepherd." And I
[1:10:45] don't believe David was uh
[1:10:49] I like this pull pit. It's new, isn't
[1:10:52] it? Since the last time I've been here,
[1:10:55] so real big and everything. It's real
[1:10:56] good. Just be courageous. Fear not. I'm
[1:11:00] with you even in you.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So anyway, and and he said, I
[1:11:06] believe David, he not only wrote this as
[1:11:08] being a a a a shepherd,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; but he also wrote it as being a sheep
[1:11:13] himself.
[1:11:15] And that's why he could say because he
[1:11:17] knew what it was like on both ends of
[1:11:20] the p perspective. Amen. That he he was
[1:11:24] not only a shepherd, but he was a sheep
[1:11:26] too under the great shepherd, the Lord
[1:11:29] Jesus Christ. And that's why he could
[1:11:32] say, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
[1:11:34] not want."
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, I ain't going to lack
[1:11:37] anything if he's my shepherd. And if
[1:11:40] he's our shepherd this morning, we won't
[1:11:43] lack anything. Whatever we have need of,
[1:11:45] he'll provide for us as being a
[1:11:47] shepherd. You believe that this morning?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord is my shepherd. I
[1:11:52] shall not want or I ain't going to lack.
[1:11:54] Whatever I have need, whatever you have
[1:11:56] need of this morning, he ain't going to
[1:11:58] let you lack. You need healing, he's
[1:12:00] here to provide it for you. He's your
[1:12:02] shepherd this morning. He'll provide you
[1:12:04] healing. If you you need encouragement
[1:12:06] this morning, he's here to encourage
[1:12:08] you. You need uplifting this morning,
[1:12:10] he's here to uplift you. Whatever you
[1:12:13] have need of this morning, he's here to
[1:12:15] do it.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord is my shepherd, I
[1:12:19] shall not want. He maketh me to lie down
[1:12:22] in green pastures."
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; In studying the sheep, I preached on
[1:12:29] this many times. In studying the sheep,
[1:12:32] there's four requirements that it takes
[1:12:34] in order for a sheep to lie down.
[1:12:38] Now, all I have is studied through books
[1:12:41] and stuff. I'm not I've not been a
[1:12:43] shepherd myself, but you know, I knew my
[1:12:45] one time my uncle, my he uh uh he had
[1:12:48] some sheep and everything. And one day
[1:12:51] we was over there with my aunt and it
[1:12:53] was her husband and uh uh uh and she he
[1:12:56] walked out there and was looking across
[1:12:59] there and I said, "What's he doing?" I
[1:13:01] asked my aunt said, "Well, he's talking
[1:13:02] to the sheep."
[1:13:04] See, the Bible says that the sheep knows
[1:13:08] the shepherd's voice,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; and a stranger they won't follow.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; So, he said, "He maketh me to lie down
[1:13:16] in green pastures." And like I said,
[1:13:17] there's four requirements in order for a
[1:13:19] sheep to lie down. Number one, they got
[1:13:22] to be free from fear.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; I thought about that. Free from fear.
[1:13:30] And I thought, you know what? Sometimes
[1:13:32] it's that that get the unknown that gets
[1:13:34] us.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; But fear, worry, mean a brother was
[1:13:39] talking about it. Worry brings illnesses
[1:13:42] onto us. Worry brings, Brother Bram
[1:13:45] said, if you was going to get shot in
[1:13:47] the morning, why worry about it?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; But if you can have faith,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; it may change the whole situation
[1:13:55] around.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; But free from fear.
[1:13:59] Oh, if they only knew. They might not
[1:14:01] see the shepherd. They may not feel the
[1:14:04] shepherd, but they can know that he's
[1:14:06] right there.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; It dispels all fear.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; What about me and you this morning? We
[1:14:12] may not feel him this morning. We may
[1:14:15] not see him this morning, but he
[1:14:17] promised that he'd be right there with
[1:14:19] us.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And if he's right there with us,
[1:14:23] all fear is gone
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; and we can lie down. Number two,
[1:14:31] free from hunger.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; He promised that he'd feed us.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He promised that he'd supply all of our
[1:14:41] needs. We pray. He told us to pray like
[1:14:45] this when he was here cuz even his
[1:14:47] disciples came to to him and said,
[1:14:50] "Lord, teach us to pray as John's taught
[1:14:54] his disciples to pray." He said, "Pray
[1:14:56] like this. Our Father, it's got to be
[1:14:58] personal. Which art in heaven,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; hallowed be thy name.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in
[1:15:08] earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
[1:15:11] day our daily bread.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Give us He'll supply whatever we have
[1:15:16] need of today. Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; So they got to be free from fear, free
[1:15:21] from hunger,
[1:15:23] free from
[1:15:25] pest.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; He said it's nothing that bothers him
[1:15:30] like the old bot flies and the warble
[1:15:34] flies and everything. Said he, this
[1:15:36] shepherd said he had to grow to he had
[1:15:38] to go to great care intently to take
[1:15:43] care of his sheep. When the time comes,
[1:15:46] flies would bother them. Nasal flies
[1:15:49] that get in their nostrils and
[1:15:50] everything, but they could be free from
[1:15:52] fear, free from hunger, free from pest,
[1:15:56] and number four, free from friction with
[1:15:59] others of their kind.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Then they could lie down.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you want to be free from all
[1:16:07] that?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; He maketh me to lie down in green
[1:16:11] pastures. He leadth me beside the still
[1:16:13] waters. Sometimes it ain't the jumping
[1:16:16] and the shouting and all that, but it's
[1:16:18] still waters that run deep.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Remember when uh Elijah was hid back up
[1:16:24] in the cave? Oh, and he heard the he
[1:16:26] seen the lightning, he heard the
[1:16:28] thunder, he heard the wind and
[1:16:29] everything, but it was in that still
[1:16:31] small voice.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my, no wonder David could say, "The
[1:16:36] Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
[1:16:39] He maketh me to lie down in green
[1:16:41] pastures. He leadth me beside the still
[1:16:43] waters. He resto my soul.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Ah, every now and then, brothers and
[1:16:49] sisters, we need a restoring of the
[1:16:51] soul.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; The things that we go through and we're
[1:16:54] all human beings, are we not? Here this
[1:16:57] morning, none of us is robots. You
[1:16:59] believe that this morning? We're all
[1:17:01] human beings. And sometimes we go
[1:17:03] through things and and and and we go
[1:17:05] through discouragements. We go through
[1:17:07] disappointments. We go through uh just
[1:17:09] the trials of life, the battles that we
[1:17:11] go through. And sometimes it brings us
[1:17:13] down and we need a touch. We need a we
[1:17:16] need a refreshing in the soul in the
[1:17:18] spirit. Is that right?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; He said as he restores our soul.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; He leadth me in the paths of
[1:17:27] righteousness for his name's sake. Yay.
[1:17:30] Though I walk through the valley of the
[1:17:32] shadow of death.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Though we may be going through the
[1:17:36] valley of the shadow of death, there's
[1:17:37] still light
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; cuz light makes a shadow.
[1:17:43] Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[1:17:44] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[1:17:46] evil,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; for thou art with me.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, thy they comfort
[1:17:53] me. You know what, brother Bram said
[1:17:55] that rod and that staff was was hard
[1:17:56] preaching.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Said they comfort me.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Verse five, there prepares the table
[1:18:02] before me in the presence of my enemies.
[1:18:04] Thou anointest my head with oil. Oh, we
[1:18:07] need a fresh anointing this morning. Is
[1:18:09] that right? I need a fresh anointing.
[1:18:12] You need a fresh anointing. I looked at
[1:18:14] that that fresh anointing. They said
[1:18:16] when them flies go, they bother them.
[1:18:17] Especially them nasal flies and
[1:18:19] everything. It said he seen a sheep one
[1:18:21] time get in and them nasal flies and it
[1:18:24] just run that sheep to death. It go to
[1:18:26] scratching. It butt his head against a
[1:18:28] tree trying to get some relief and
[1:18:30] everything. So he had his own h kind of
[1:18:33] he and I forget what all he took. It was
[1:18:35] tar and and I forget what all he had. a
[1:18:37] mixture of stuff that he mixed together
[1:18:40] and he just anointed that sheep's head.
[1:18:43] Oh, hallelujah. I want my head anointed
[1:18:45] this morning. Amen. From Almighty God.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah. He said, "My cup runth
[1:18:52] over." Amen. I want my cup running over.
[1:18:55] I want it full, but I want it running
[1:18:57] over. So maybe I'll have to drink from
[1:18:59] my saucer cuz my cup's running over.
[1:19:02] Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Then he said in verse six, "Surely
[1:19:04] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:19:07] the days of my life, and I will dwell in
[1:19:09] the house of the Lord forever." And
[1:19:11] that's what I want to kind of speak on
[1:19:13] this. Surely goodness and mercy.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Like I said, the sheep know their
[1:19:19] shepherd.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; We know the shepherd today.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe we need to uh uh
[1:19:28] nothing. We don't need nothing to worry
[1:19:30] about. We shouldn't we shouldn't worry
[1:19:32] about anything because the shepherds got
[1:19:34] everything under control.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; You believe that? The shepherd's got
[1:19:38] everything under control. So why should
[1:19:41] we worry this morning?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] It's goodness and mercy I believe will
[1:19:49] be will be the treatment received from
[1:19:52] the master's expert loving hands from
[1:19:55] the shepherd's exert loving hands.
[1:19:58] That's what he's going to give them
[1:19:59] sheep. goodness and mercy. And many of
[1:20:02] you are type of sheep this morning. And
[1:20:05] I believe that's what many of you are
[1:20:06] going to get this morning is surely
[1:20:08] goodness and mercy.
[1:20:11] Amen. I want some of that this morning.
[1:20:13] It's surely goodness and his mercy.
[1:20:17] That's what I want this morning.
[1:20:21] Oh, you know, I feel this way about
[1:20:24] Christ. Amen. said, "I believe he sure
[1:20:26] he's truly concerned about each and
[1:20:29] every one of us this morning."
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; He's concerned about what you go through
[1:20:33] this morning. He's concerned about what
[1:20:35] your needs are this morning. That's why
[1:20:37] he said, "I will supply every one of
[1:20:40] your needs."
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why David could cry out,
[1:20:43] "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[1:20:46] lack." Like I said this morning,
[1:20:48] whatever you have need of this morning,
[1:20:50] you need more of the Holy Ghost. Well,
[1:20:52] the there the more of the Holy Ghost to
[1:20:54] receive this morning. The deep calling
[1:20:56] to the deep. If there's a deep calling,
[1:20:59] there's a deep to respond to that call
[1:21:01] this morning. You want more of him this
[1:21:04] morning. I believe there's more of him
[1:21:05] to receive.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; I need more of him this morning.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; I thank him for what he's brought me
[1:21:13] through.
[1:21:14] Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hey, I I was passing blood for over a
[1:21:18] year
[1:21:21] and I came out when I first had my first
[1:21:23] colonoscopy about a year ago, year and a
[1:21:26] half ago. I got in there, man. I was
[1:21:28] ready. Brother David, I was ready.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Hey, they told me said, "Man, you going
[1:21:33] to have to drink that nasty stuff and
[1:21:35] everything." And I was kind of be
[1:21:37] honest, I was ready. First one I ever
[1:21:38] had. I was kind of scared. I I'll be
[1:21:42] honest with you.
[1:21:43] Hey, let's be honest. We're all human
[1:21:45] beings.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Some of us go to the dentist and we get
[1:21:48] kind of scared. Hey, you never know
[1:21:50] anymore.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; You just never know.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hey, I want to be in God's hands.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; I want to be in his hands. I'll just
[1:22:00] give you a brief rundown. Can I real
[1:22:01] quickly? So, about a year and a half
[1:22:04] ago, went through my first colonoscopy.
[1:22:06] This guy, he was just a a general uh
[1:22:09] surgeon. He was not a colonoscopy
[1:22:11] doctor. in that in that field or that
[1:22:13] expert in that field cuz sometimes they
[1:22:15] want to send you to, you know, uh
[1:22:17] somebody that's whatever trouble you
[1:22:19] got, they want to send you to somebody
[1:22:21] that's kind of expert in that field. So,
[1:22:23] I got in there and I drunk all that
[1:22:25] stuff the night before and everything.
[1:22:27] Got ready, got in there and my wife
[1:22:29] noticed they came and got me. You know,
[1:22:31] you know how it is. They come in there
[1:22:32] and take the vi your vitals and
[1:22:34] everything. Come in there, the
[1:22:35] anesthesiologist comes and talks to you
[1:22:37] and all this stuff. And I don't know why
[1:22:39] they always tell me. They said, "Now,
[1:22:41] this is the same thing that uh what
[1:22:43] Michael Jackson took.
[1:22:47] I don't know why they tell you that."
[1:22:52] Anyway, I said, "Well, okay. Thank God."
[1:22:57] So, they they will me back there, you
[1:22:59] know. My wife kissed me. So, I she said,
[1:23:01] "Well, we'll have them back about 20 30
[1:23:03] minutes." And she was noticing everybody
[1:23:04] was coming back laying on their side cuz
[1:23:06] how they do the procedure and everything
[1:23:08] laying on your side and everything for
[1:23:10] and all that stuff and all that. And so
[1:23:13] I came back and I had a tube down my
[1:23:15] throat, oxygen up my nose.
[1:23:18] They asked my wife said, "Hey, has he
[1:23:21] ever drank? He ever smoked?" Said he
[1:23:23] needs to go see his heart doctor.
[1:23:26] My oxygen level dropped. My heart
[1:23:29] started acting up. The doctor came in
[1:23:31] there and said, "I'm sorry. only got a
[1:23:33] third of it done.
[1:23:35] I was very disappointed.
[1:23:37] So from that point on, for over a year
[1:23:40] of trying to get my heart regulated,
[1:23:42] trying to find out what was wrong with
[1:23:43] my heart, what was wrong with my oxygen
[1:23:45] level dropped. Finally, make a long
[1:23:47] story short, got that all tended to back
[1:23:50] in April this year. Had my next
[1:23:52] colonoscopy, they found a polip. It was
[1:23:54] about 5 cm, which is about 2 in long.
[1:23:58] And and then said he took took it out.
[1:24:01] Said it was like a cauliflower. Said he
[1:24:03] cut it off at the base. Said sent it off
[1:24:05] to get it, you know, get it biopsied.
[1:24:08] Said and he even gave us his personal
[1:24:10] number. Said, "Call me cuz you call my
[1:24:12] office." Said, "Probably in a couple
[1:24:13] days I I'll know just what it is or if
[1:24:17] it's benign or cancerous or whatever."
[1:24:19] Said, "Call me. Don't call my office
[1:24:21] because you probably won't get a hold of
[1:24:22] me." Said, "Just call me." Well, I tried
[1:24:24] to call him. He called us back on a
[1:24:26] Friday. said it was cantress said but I
[1:24:28] think I got it all said but I want you
[1:24:32] to come back in and do another
[1:24:33] colonoscopy in in uh May went back in he
[1:24:37] took two more pallets out but nothing
[1:24:39] wrong with them but he said but between
[1:24:41] then and there I had to have a CT scan
[1:24:44] had to have a PET scan and all them
[1:24:46] things but everything came back all out
[1:24:48] good and everything he said well there's
[1:24:50] 10 inches right there certain spot there
[1:24:53] 10 inches that needs to come out about
[1:24:55] 10 inches there It's bunching up. It's
[1:24:57] nearing right there and it needs to come
[1:24:58] out. It's right there where that polip
[1:25:01] was. And so said, "So, so said so do you
[1:25:05] have a surgeon?" I go, "No, I don't have
[1:25:06] a surgeon." He So he he he named
[1:25:09] someone. I said, "Okay." He said, "He's
[1:25:11] he's top-notch in the field." I said,
[1:25:13] "Good." Said, "But something happened
[1:25:15] and they called me the day before I was
[1:25:16] going to go see this surgeon." Said,
[1:25:18] "He's on emergency medical leave. We
[1:25:19] don't know when he's going to be back."
[1:25:22] I said, ' Man, I said, 'Well, Lord, you
[1:25:25] got everything under control
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; through the grape vine. We kind of heard
[1:25:28] what maybe happened. Whether that's true
[1:25:30] or not, don't know, but then God put me
[1:25:32] with another one cuz I think it was God.
[1:25:35] He usually put, you know, and I like
[1:25:37] this surgeon. He seems like he knowed
[1:25:39] everything. He he he did it uh uh
[1:25:42] robotically and uh what do you call it?
[1:25:44] Appostocopic or whatever you call it.
[1:25:46] He's a expert in that field. had about
[1:25:49] 15 20 years experience. Want somebody
[1:25:52] with experience. But before that, you
[1:25:54] know, he said, "We'll get together." But
[1:25:56] before that, I ended back up in the
[1:25:58] hospital
[1:25:59] running back and forth to the restroom.
[1:26:01] Couldn't hardly make it sometimes. And
[1:26:03] and come to find out what they said. And
[1:26:05] they did another colonoscopy. Then when
[1:26:07] I was in the hospital, cuz a surgeon
[1:26:09] came in said, "Hey, your doctor, your
[1:26:10] colonoscopy doctor, he wants to do
[1:26:11] another one." He said, "Now both of
[1:26:13] them," he said, "now tomorrow." He said,
[1:26:15] "If everything comes out all right." But
[1:26:16] he said, "Cuz you want two good ends
[1:26:18] when we reconnect it to be healthy. You
[1:26:20] want this end and this end to be healthy
[1:26:22] cuz you don't want no bag. I don't want
[1:26:23] to have to give you a bag." I said,
[1:26:25] "Okay, but come back." Wasn't cuz the
[1:26:28] colonoscopy doctor said, "Man, your
[1:26:29] colon looks like hamburger meat. Look
[1:26:31] like it's been chewed on." Said Kate
[1:26:34] said, "You need to wait about a month."
[1:26:36] Boy, I was disappointed. But you know,
[1:26:37] still God's got everything under
[1:26:39] control. Went back in, seen my
[1:26:41] colonoscopy doctor. He said he thought I
[1:26:43] had Crohn's. They tested me for IBS,
[1:26:46] ultrated colitis, and uh uh Crohn's
[1:26:49] disease. Said I thought he may have
[1:26:51] Crohn's, but then he said, "I don't
[1:26:52] think he did. I think he got food
[1:26:54] poisoning, whatever. But I know God
[1:26:56] takes care of everything." So about what
[1:26:58] a month later had another CT scan.
[1:27:01] Everything came back all right. Said,
[1:27:02] "You're good to go with your surgery."
[1:27:04] So I had surgery, like I said, five
[1:27:06] weeks ago. went and then my surgeon I
[1:27:09] seen him two weeks after the surgery and
[1:27:12] he wasn't there but his nurse
[1:27:13] practitioner she goes I'm from the old
[1:27:15] school I didn't get these gray hairs for
[1:27:18] nothing said I want to send you to a
[1:27:20] cancer doctor sent me to a cancer doctor
[1:27:23] he came out there said I got some good
[1:27:25] news
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; said you don't have no have no
[1:27:27] treatments or nothing said everything's
[1:27:30] fine said I just want you to come back
[1:27:31] in six months so we can keep up with you
[1:27:34] to see how you're doing
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; I stopped him right there you You know
[1:27:37] what I said? I said, you know what I
[1:27:40] said? Stop right there for a minute. I
[1:27:41] said, "Thank God." Amen. I said, "Hey, I
[1:27:44] thank God that he gave you the knowledge
[1:27:46] to know how to take care of me, but hey,
[1:27:48] I also uh my ultimate healing comes from
[1:27:50] God." Amen.
[1:27:56] Hallelujah.
[1:27:57] Oh, so he knows how to take care of us.
[1:28:00] Amen. Oh, I feel that way about Christ.
[1:28:04] He's truly concerned about me. And no
[1:28:06] matter what happens in my life or in
[1:28:08] your life this morning, we're being
[1:28:10] followed by goodness and mercy. Amen.
[1:28:14] I'm glad for that. That's what we're
[1:28:16] being followed by this morning is his
[1:28:18] goodness and his mercy. Our body may
[1:28:21] break down. Your body may break down. It
[1:28:24] just hey, it just the way it is.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And sometimes some of ours breaks down
[1:28:30] fast sooner quicker than others. It's
[1:28:33] just a grabag of life. That's just the
[1:28:35] way it is. Our bodies break down. The
[1:28:38] prophet of God said about the age of 20,
[1:28:40] 25, you start dying.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Hey, and that's just the way it is. Body
[1:28:46] breaks down. Sometimes we stand back
[1:28:49] helpless as our spouse dies or whatever.
[1:28:52] Your job may fold up. Whatever it may
[1:28:55] be. Hey, that's just the way it is. But
[1:28:57] what is your reaction to everything?
[1:29:00] Yes.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; What's your reaction?
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:08] Children running with the wrong crowd.
[1:29:13] Your friends prove false,
[1:29:16] turn against you, but you got surely
[1:29:19] goodness and mercy following you.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] Thank you, Lord Jesus, for your goodness
[1:29:26] and your mercy this morning.
[1:29:29] the shepherd, he may, you know, you
[1:29:32] looking back, a shepherd may look back
[1:29:33] and see, my everything that he's been
[1:29:36] through to take care of them sheep cuz
[1:29:38] he wants to make sure, especially if
[1:29:40] he's got them to uh to to kind of uh
[1:29:43] breed them back and forth or whatever
[1:29:45] and sell them and what he wants to make
[1:29:47] sure he has a good stock. He makes he
[1:29:50] wants to make sure he's got a good breed
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; if he's going to make try to make some
[1:29:55] money or a business with it.
[1:29:58] Hey, and that's the way the Lord,
[1:30:01] we're supposed to produce, me and you.
[1:30:03] We're his children. We're his sons and
[1:30:06] daughters. We're his sheep. Sheep bear
[1:30:08] sheep,
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; right? And he wants us to bear. He wants
[1:30:14] us to bear fruit.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He wants us to be productive.
[1:30:20] And so he
[1:30:22] goes through a lot of things
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; to bring me and you to where we're at
[1:30:27] today.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; And a shepherd he if he looks back
[1:30:35] maybe over the years caring for his
[1:30:38] sheep.
[1:30:40] Maybe they they he's been through utter
[1:30:43] calamities and we can say that that may
[1:30:45] be in the natural but what about the
[1:30:47] spiritual sometimes
[1:30:50] looking back the great shepherd looking
[1:30:52] back oh he might has brought he might
[1:30:55] have has brought us through utter
[1:30:58] calamities this morning we might have
[1:31:01] been through in all kinds of situations
[1:31:03] this morning ups and downs in and outs
[1:31:10] past we might have took like going
[1:31:12] through a uh going down a blind alley,
[1:31:17] might have been black as night, but the
[1:31:20] end it turned out for my benefit
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; and my well-being.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; I might not know why I went through that
[1:31:29] calamity.
[1:31:31] I might have not known why I've been
[1:31:33] going maybe seem like a going through a
[1:31:35] blind alley. Didn't know which direction
[1:31:38] I was going. baby, so to speak. Might
[1:31:42] have been as black as night, but at the
[1:31:44] end, it turned out for my good.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me tell you something this
[1:31:50] morning, church. No matter what you're
[1:31:52] going through this morning, it may be
[1:31:54] like you may think you're going through
[1:31:55] a blind alley. You might be think, my
[1:31:57] this calamity, I don't know. But he
[1:31:59] knows the end
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; from the beginning.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it may be in your
[1:32:07] benefit. Just say, "God, you're my
[1:32:09] shepherd this morning. I shall not
[1:32:12] lack."
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You promise you take care of me.
[1:32:17] You make me let lie down in green
[1:32:18] pastures. Let me be free from fear. Let
[1:32:21] me be free from pest. Let me be free
[1:32:23] from everything that bothers me, Lord.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And y'all turn out all right, Lord.
[1:32:31] Why do I love him? Because he first
[1:32:34] loved me.
[1:32:38] Jesus loves me
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; and he loves you.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; You said, "How do you know?" The Bible
[1:32:44] tells me so.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; His goodness and his mercy are new every
[1:32:50] day.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Every morning.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; That song the brother sung, I think.
[1:32:59] What would I do without the Lord?
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; What would you do this morning without
[1:33:03] the Lord?
[1:33:08] the song. I thank that sister sung.
[1:33:10] Amen.
[1:33:12] Oh, I thank you, Jesus.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; I just want to have strength to praise
[1:33:17] you this morning. I can't thank him
[1:33:19] enough.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I can't praise him enough.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; I can't lift my hands enough to him.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; He's been so good to me.
[1:33:34] I love him because he first loved me.
[1:33:37] Thank you, Lord. Loved me when I was
[1:33:39] unlovable.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; When you think no one else cares, he
[1:33:43] cares.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; He cares. Do you care?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; When you think no one else loves you, he
[1:33:54] loves you.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; When you think everything is going
[1:33:57] against you, he's not against you.
[1:34:00] That's right.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; He's working it out.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You may not think it, but he's working
[1:34:06] it out.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; It'll be for your good and your benefit.
[1:34:11] Hallelujah.
[1:34:13] Amen. First John 3:16 says it like this.
[1:34:16] Hereby perceive we
[1:34:19] the love of God, because he laid down
[1:34:21] his life for us, we ought also to lay
[1:34:24] down our lives for the brethren. We
[1:34:26] ought to be able to lay down our lives
[1:34:28] for one another.
[1:34:30] Amen. Lay down our lives for each other.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to pray for one
[1:34:35] another.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, this brother said, I
[1:34:39] don't care. I ain't I didn't come here
[1:34:41] to say the differences we have or or
[1:34:44] whatever." We are to love one another.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; We are to pray for one another.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; His good I don't want his goodness and
[1:34:52] mercy. I don't want it to become
[1:34:54] stagnate stagnated in my life.
[1:34:58] You said, "Well, brother David, what are
[1:34:59] you talking about? I want to be able to
[1:35:02] pass it on to others."
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; You take I used to clean for a living uh
[1:35:10] custodial work and you may make a good,
[1:35:14] you know, solution of mop water and I
[1:35:16] mop the floor and it may smell so good
[1:35:18] and everything, but you know what
[1:35:20] happens to it? If you lay it sit there
[1:35:23] and set there and set there,
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; it becomes stagnated.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; We just let goodness and mercy sit in
[1:35:33] our lives.
[1:35:36] Let it sit and let it sit and we don't
[1:35:39] pass it on to others. We don't let it
[1:35:41] flow out of our lives like it's supposed
[1:35:44] to. You know what happens? It becomes
[1:35:46] stagnated in our lives.
[1:35:48] I don't want it to become stagnated.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; I want to pass it on to others.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want it to be a positive and
[1:35:57] practical aspect that my life in turn
[1:36:00] can be a blessing to somebody else.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; You want your life to be, hey, I want my
[1:36:07] when I go around wherever I might go to,
[1:36:10] when I go uh uh uh uh preaching for
[1:36:12] somebody else or whatever it is, I don't
[1:36:14] want to be a hindrance. I don't want to
[1:36:16] be a burden. I want to be a help.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I want to put my shoulder to the wheel.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I want to put my shoulder to the load.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I remember one time and I'm kind of
[1:36:30] like, you know, some I'm glad my wife,
[1:36:33] she gets to go with me quite a bit now
[1:36:36] and places, but one place one time she
[1:36:38] wasn't there.
[1:36:40] They said, 'Now, Brother David, if you
[1:36:41] see anything on the table that is not
[1:36:43] there, he's eating, you know, said just,
[1:36:46] you know, get up and get it. Look in the
[1:36:48] refrigerator.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Well, I remember what Brother Brown said
[1:36:52] when he preached on doors in a door.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you invite me to my house,
[1:36:57] you know how it is." He said, "You got
[1:36:59] many doors. If he just comes in there
[1:37:01] and you say, "Wait a right here. Christ
[1:37:03] ain't very welcome, but you want him to
[1:37:05] go in every room of your heart."
[1:37:08] He said somebody called told me so
[1:37:09] brother just he said I go to the
[1:37:11] refrigerator
[1:37:13] I make me a big sandwich I'd kick off my
[1:37:16] shoes I go get in bed and I'll just have
[1:37:17] me a gastronomical jubilee
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; where something wasn't sitting on the
[1:37:21] table
[1:37:23] and I look around I said well they ain't
[1:37:25] got this I said y'all ain't got this on
[1:37:26] the table I said I just got up and went
[1:37:28] over their refrigerator open their door
[1:37:30] my wife would have killed me if she'd
[1:37:31] have been with me but hey they said make
[1:37:35] yourself at home.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; I went somewhere and I told them they
[1:37:39] and and and and their testimony here and
[1:37:41] I ain't trying to be braggious this
[1:37:43] morning or whatever, but they told me
[1:37:45] said, "Brother David said, we've never
[1:37:47] had anybody like cuz I I being a I I
[1:37:50] ain't been a pastor, but I I know
[1:37:51] Brother Homer, different ones. I've been
[1:37:53] sitting under him for about 25 years now
[1:37:56] and and different ones. And hey, and I
[1:37:58] understand that, hey, what they go
[1:38:00] through sometimes and people they invite
[1:38:01] that to maybe they'd want to help the
[1:38:03] church, encourage you, and sometimes you
[1:38:04] don't know who you going to invite, what
[1:38:06] kind of character that guy is going to
[1:38:08] be.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; So I was there and the the pastor's wife
[1:38:12] said, "Brother Dave, we appreciate you
[1:38:14] being here." Said, "You just" said,
[1:38:15] "Man, you just don't know." Said, "You
[1:38:17] just been so respectful and we ain't had
[1:38:20] to do much. Ain't had to pick up behind
[1:38:22] you." Said, I said, "Well, I thank you.
[1:38:24] I appreciate that. They they respected
[1:38:26] me for that." I said, "Hey, I I'm an
[1:38:28] example not only to my church, but to
[1:38:30] Christ."
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to be a blessing to
[1:38:34] others.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; I don't, like I said, I don't want to be
[1:38:36] a hindrance. Amen. I want my life to be
[1:38:39] a blessing. I want to say, "Hey, I want
[1:38:41] my life to to I want my light to shine."
[1:38:44] I was reading the message this morning,
[1:38:46] Brother at the end of the message, he
[1:38:47] was singing that song, Lord, let the
[1:38:49] shine on me. Shine on me. Let the light
[1:38:52] from the lighthouse shine on. That's
[1:38:54] what I want him to do this morning.
[1:38:56] Shine on me, Lord. Let your goodness and
[1:38:58] your mercy flow out of my life to
[1:39:00] others.
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:06] But sheep under the wrong kind of
[1:39:08] shepherd,
[1:39:10] they say they're the most destructive
[1:39:12] livestock that there is.
[1:39:17] They said they can run and uh make ra
[1:39:21] and ravage land almost above remedy.
[1:39:27] In other words, if they're under the
[1:39:28] wrong kind of shepherd and they're the
[1:39:30] most destructive livestock, they can
[1:39:33] ravage a land to where you there's maybe
[1:39:35] not any remedy for that land at all. I
[1:39:39] thought my
[1:39:41] they can r but they on the contrast
[1:39:46] they can be the most beneficial of all
[1:39:49] livestock.
[1:39:52] It just depends on what kind of shepherd
[1:39:53] they're sent under.
[1:39:56] Don't you want to be under the right
[1:39:57] kind of shepherd?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, he's just a shepherd under
[1:40:03] the great shepherd.
[1:40:05] But the prophet of God said, "You ought
[1:40:07] to pray about who you set under."
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us, Lord. He said they could
[1:40:17] be the most beneficial under the right
[1:40:19] leadership, under the right shepherd. He
[1:40:22] said,
[1:40:24] "And if they're fed the right kind of
[1:40:25] food, they're fed the right kind of
[1:40:28] sheep food and everything, it's they
[1:40:30] that that that said their manure can be
[1:40:33] the best fertilizer that ever was. If
[1:40:37] they're fed right, they're under the
[1:40:38] right kind of shepherd. They're fed the
[1:40:40] right kind of food and everything. They
[1:40:43] can be the most productive livestock
[1:40:45] that there is, the most beneficial
[1:40:47] livestock. Their manure is the best
[1:40:49] fertilizer. But if they eat the wrong
[1:40:51] kind of stuff and they eat something
[1:40:53] maybe something that they can spread
[1:40:55] through their through their waist or
[1:40:57] whatever it it a noxious weed or
[1:40:59] whatever. My my it just it just ravages
[1:41:03] the land. But the flock if they're well
[1:41:05] managed they can restore land. My and
[1:41:09] that's why if they're they're well
[1:41:11] managed and everything a flock of sheep
[1:41:12] can restore a land. That's why they
[1:41:14] always refer they refer to sheep as
[1:41:17] those of the golden hooves
[1:41:21] because they can make a my he said I've
[1:41:23] seen some beautiful land beautiful
[1:41:26] landscapes that the sheep their manure
[1:41:28] and everything has been there and they
[1:41:30] they they were fed well they were took
[1:41:32] care well. He said, "I seen many parks
[1:41:36] that were beautiful
[1:41:38] and it's because sheep had grazed on
[1:41:39] them and everything."
[1:41:42] And this shepherd that I was uh was
[1:41:45] reading about that had sheep, he said,
[1:41:47] "I had to restore," he said, "I had to
[1:41:49] restore two ranches myself cuz there the
[1:41:53] sheep wasn't taken care of and they just
[1:41:56] uh just ravaged the land and everything
[1:41:58] around them. It ruined the the the the
[1:42:00] ranch and everything." But he said, "I
[1:42:02] had to take and restore those two
[1:42:05] ranches if I could." And he did. He
[1:42:07] said, he said, "But what about my life?
[1:42:10] What about your life this morning? Is it
[1:42:13] a blessing
[1:42:16] that you leave behind?
[1:42:19] What do you leave behind
[1:42:22] on your job? What do you leave behind?"
[1:42:24] Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; I know when we're working sometimes,
[1:42:26] brothers and sisters, especially if
[1:42:28] you're working maybe in a in a place in
[1:42:31] a factory or whatever it may be,
[1:42:32] sometimes the people you work with, they
[1:42:34] can kind of frustrate you.
[1:42:37] You get to a place, hey, just let me do
[1:42:39] it. You know, you know how it is,
[1:42:41] brother. Sometimes you got help or
[1:42:43] whatever, you just, hey, let let me do
[1:42:45] it. Just let me you go about your
[1:42:47] business. I'll take care of this. But
[1:42:49] what does your life leave behind?
[1:42:54] This shepherd that I was reading about,
[1:42:57] he said one time this he had this couple
[1:43:00] of guys that were staying with him.
[1:43:04] And so he would they was going to go on
[1:43:05] this trip and they asked him to come
[1:43:07] along.
[1:43:08] So he said he would and said when they
[1:43:10] left and when they got to the place
[1:43:11] where they were going, that one guy that
[1:43:14] had stayed with him, he said, "Oh man,"
[1:43:16] he said, "I forgot my hat at your
[1:43:19] house."
[1:43:21] He said, "You think you can call your
[1:43:23] wife
[1:43:24] and have her look for it and find my hat
[1:43:27] and send it to where we're at now?" So
[1:43:30] he called his wife.
[1:43:32] She got to looking around and she looked
[1:43:35] everywhere and every corner of the
[1:43:37] house, everywhere,
[1:43:39] every place she could think of. She
[1:43:42] called back said,
[1:43:44] evidently he didn't even he didn't bring
[1:43:46] his hat or whatever, but he didn't leave
[1:43:48] it behind,
[1:43:50] but said he did leave something behind
[1:43:53] and that was a blessing.
[1:43:57] What about you?
[1:44:00] What do people feel about me? What do
[1:44:03] people feel about you?
[1:44:06] Do you leave a trail of sad uh glad
[1:44:08] sadness or do you live a trail of
[1:44:10] gladness?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Do you live goodness and mercy
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; or do they forget you at all about you?
[1:44:21] Do you deposit a blessing or misery
[1:44:24] others? Is your life a pleasure or is it
[1:44:28] a pain?
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 52:7. Now, we always quote this
[1:44:35] scripture that I'm fixing to quote to
[1:44:38] you. We always talk about ministers.
[1:44:42] How beautiful are the How beautiful
[1:44:45] mountains are the feet of him that bring
[1:44:47] good tidings.
[1:44:50] I always say that ministers have pretty
[1:44:53] feet because they bring good tidings.
[1:44:56] But listen to all of it. How beautiful
[1:44:58] are the ma upon the mountains are the
[1:45:01] feet of him that bringeth good tidings
[1:45:04] that
[1:45:07] bringeth
[1:45:08] peace that bringeth good tidings of good
[1:45:11] that publishes salvation that saith unto
[1:45:14] Zion.
[1:45:16] Thy God reignth.
[1:45:19] Amen. So all of us can deposit something
[1:45:22] when we go somewhere. Whether it's on
[1:45:24] our job, in the grocery store, visiting
[1:45:27] a relative, or whatever it may be, we
[1:45:29] all can leave good things behind. We can
[1:45:31] we can publish peace. We can publish
[1:45:34] salvation.
[1:45:36] And we can always say, "My God reignth."
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Does your God reign this morning? Amen.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Let me calm down now.
[1:45:48] They said I got to take it easy for and
[1:45:50] I don't know how long. You know, I
[1:45:52] Google and Google's always right. They
[1:45:55] said usually about four weeks a person's
[1:45:56] good to go, but I my health my home
[1:45:59] health nurse said, "You know what?" said
[1:46:01] cuz I did do some part-time work in a
[1:46:03] grocery store pulling on pallets,
[1:46:04] unloading a truck and everything and all
[1:46:06] that. They said you might not want to go
[1:46:08] back to doing that about to after the
[1:46:11] first of the year said because you may
[1:46:12] look good your scars and everything may
[1:46:14] look good on the outside but on the
[1:46:15] inside there was some major surgery.
[1:46:20] So listen what the prophet of God said
[1:46:23] kinsman redeemer 1960
[1:46:27] he said now on the road back there come
[1:46:29] a time as her being a type of the church
[1:46:32] or of the Christian talking about you
[1:46:34] know he's talking about Ruth and all
[1:46:36] that as each individual each individual
[1:46:39] we as individuals represent the entire
[1:46:42] Christian nation
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; did you know that you and your behavior
[1:46:50] and the way you act
[1:46:53] and what you do, you represent the
[1:46:56] entire body of Christ.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; So when I was at that place preaching,
[1:47:02] visiting, I represent brother Homer and
[1:47:06] his church.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Not only that, but I represent him.
[1:47:13] They tell me, and I've heard brother
[1:47:16] Billy Paul's testimony
[1:47:19] many times. He said, "My dad had friends
[1:47:21] and my dad had enemies, but you could
[1:47:24] not distinguish the two from each other.
[1:47:27] He loved them just the same.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; He's still working on me." Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; In your behavior, in the way you act,
[1:47:39] and what you do represent the entire
[1:47:42] body of Christ.
[1:47:45] I say, Lord, I don't want to bring a
[1:47:46] reproach.
[1:47:50] Let goodness and mercy follow me.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Let me not bring a reproach
[1:47:55] to your cause, Lord. Let me What did the
[1:47:58] prophet of God say one of his last
[1:48:00] messages? What house will you build me
[1:48:01] in Tucson 1965? He said, keep all the
[1:48:04] smud off the message.
[1:48:08] They leave me live in such a way.
[1:48:14] I remember one time,
[1:48:16] I forget where we was at, and I was
[1:48:18] listening
[1:48:20] brother Billy Paul's testimony
[1:48:23] and coming back across, I forget where
[1:48:25] they was coming from. I think California
[1:48:27] or somewhere.
[1:48:28] And somebody had put some fresh nuts or
[1:48:30] whatever in the car. Brother Brandham
[1:48:34] didn't know about it. I think they
[1:48:36] handed them to Billy Paul
[1:48:39] and he put them in there. Well, when
[1:48:41] they go through, you have to press, you
[1:48:43] have to pass through the port of entry,
[1:48:44] you know, out the states and they always
[1:48:47] asked you there said, "Do you have any
[1:48:49] fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, fresh uh
[1:48:52] whatever?" And brother did not know
[1:48:54] about them nuts being in there.
[1:48:58] Well, when he got home, two hours down
[1:49:00] the road home.
[1:49:02] When he got home, as I was unloading the
[1:49:04] car, he said, "Where did these come
[1:49:05] from?" Cuz when they crossed, Billy Paul
[1:49:07] was asleep in a car. He said, "Well,
[1:49:09] somebody," he said, "Well, I told that
[1:49:11] guy at the state line that I didn't have
[1:49:13] any." You know what he did? He got in
[1:49:16] his car, drove two hours back
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm sorry."
[1:49:20] What would we have done?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Goodness and mercy. Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet human being just
[1:49:29] like me and you are. He got frustrated
[1:49:31] because of them lawyers and everything
[1:49:33] called him and when they rang and sister
[1:49:36] his wife answered the phone system meet.
[1:49:37] He said Bill it's them lawyers again. He
[1:49:40] ran out the back said tell them I'm not
[1:49:42] here.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Huh? He got frustrated. He got upset.
[1:49:48] Hey. He got stressed out
[1:49:51] when he came back in the house just me
[1:49:53] you know crying and everything said hey
[1:49:55] you know and all all all that said do
[1:49:57] you I I wasn't here I I I had stepped
[1:50:00] out back
[1:50:03] I think what was it that he said that
[1:50:05] phone ring he said daddy should I tell
[1:50:07] Joseph little Joseph said daddy should I
[1:50:08] tell them you're not here or whatever
[1:50:09] see everything that we do it causes an
[1:50:12] effect on somebody else
[1:50:17] and he started to pray for somebody. You
[1:50:19] remember the story?
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; He went to lay hands on a little girl
[1:50:22] that was sick and God said, "Hey, you
[1:50:25] told a lie and now you going to lay
[1:50:27] hands and he won't apologize to that
[1:50:29] lawyer." See, our behavior, we represent
[1:50:32] the entire body of Christ. You say, "But
[1:50:34] I'm just a lay member." That doesn't
[1:50:35] matter. When you take on that name of
[1:50:37] Christian, you represent Christ in his
[1:50:39] church. You should live like that. You
[1:50:41] should live like gentlemen, like ladies.
[1:50:44] Don't never do things of the world
[1:50:45] because the whole eyes of heaven and
[1:50:47] earth is cast on you to represent that
[1:50:49] one thing. No matter how weak you are,
[1:50:51] how little you are, hold your head right
[1:50:54] cuz you are a Christian.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I want to hold my head right this
[1:50:59] morning cuz I'm a Christian this
[1:51:01] morning.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then there's some questions
[1:51:05] we should ask ourselves.
[1:51:08] Do I leave behind peace in lives or
[1:51:12] turmoil?
[1:51:17] Do I leave behind forgiveness
[1:51:20] or bitterness?
[1:51:23] Do I leave behind contentment or
[1:51:26] conflict?
[1:51:28] Do I leave behind flowers of joy
[1:51:33] or frustration?
[1:51:36] Do I leave behind love
[1:51:39] or bitter anger?
[1:51:42] some good questions.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; What do you leave behind?
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Some people leave behind a mess
[1:51:52] and they got to cover their tracks.
[1:51:57] They always say if you tell one lie, you
[1:51:59] got to tell another one to cover it up.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Then you got to tell another one to
[1:52:03] cover that lie up.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Just be honest.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Tell the truth in the beginning.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You'll never have to cover that up. What
[1:52:10] do you leave behind?
[1:52:13] What's your behavior?
[1:52:15] How do you act?
[1:52:18] You represent the entire body. You leave
[1:52:20] behind a mess that you got to cover your
[1:52:22] tracks.
[1:52:26] We're a true child of God
[1:52:29] under the good shepherd's care.
[1:52:33] We're not fear be ashamed.
[1:52:37] And we can go back to the place where we
[1:52:39] lived at before.
[1:52:42] We don't have to worry about anybody
[1:52:43] turning their heads. We won't have to
[1:52:46] worry about anybody not talking to us.
[1:52:48] We won't have to We can hold our heads
[1:52:50] up high. Why? Because we're a Christian.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Because we're a child of God. Cuz we
[1:52:55] leave behind goodness and mercy.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember that one time this
[1:53:02] one guy, his came to town to visit and
[1:53:06] he he ran into this guy that he knew,
[1:53:08] friend of his, ran into his son, his
[1:53:10] little boy, and he told him all about
[1:53:12] the things that him and his dad did when
[1:53:14] they were a little boy, how much rotten
[1:53:17] stuff they did, how much trouble they
[1:53:19] got into,
[1:53:21] all kinds of things that they did that
[1:53:23] were wrong. And when he went to and when
[1:53:26] he went back home, he told his dad said,
[1:53:28] "Dad, I ran into a friend of yours that
[1:53:29] came to town to visit." And he told me
[1:53:31] about all the everything that you ever
[1:53:33] done, all the lies you ever told, every
[1:53:35] the time you got in trouble. He said,
[1:53:36] "Next time you run into old John, you go
[1:53:39] tell John come see me and I'll tell him
[1:53:40] how this old boy died."
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. This old guy died a long time ago.
[1:53:47] [Applause]
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] You know, there was a you know, we used
[1:53:53] to live in a town where I where I grew
[1:53:56] up. Uh some of my life was in Emerald,
[1:53:58] Texas. How many knows that's where the
[1:54:00] prophet left the scene at? Emeralda,
[1:54:02] Texas. You can read it. And brother
[1:54:04] Perry Green put out a book, Acts of the
[1:54:06] Prophet. Emerald, Texas. The old uh uh
[1:54:09] hospital where he's in. It's a it's a it
[1:54:11] used a I guess a apartment complex now
[1:54:15] in it or something like that. It's last
[1:54:17] time we was there so ran down. But let
[1:54:19] me tell you, there was a there was a
[1:54:20] William Brandham that lived many many
[1:54:22] years ago. See, William Brandham
[1:54:24] actually didn't die in in Amarella. No,
[1:54:27] there was a William Brandham that lived
[1:54:28] many many years ago that swore that he
[1:54:31] killed the cop that killed his dog.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; There was a William Brandom that lived
[1:54:36] many years ago that they made fun of,
[1:54:39] called him a Kentucky squall and and and
[1:54:41] mashed his face in so he'd have to drink
[1:54:43] from a straw and went and got a gun and
[1:54:45] was going to kill every one of them.
[1:54:48] But that William Brandham died a long
[1:54:51] time ago.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And the William Brham that didn't die
[1:54:54] but just went to sleep in Emerald, Texas
[1:54:56] was a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:04] [Applause]
[1:55:07] Amen. There's a guy I was read remember
[1:55:10] reading a story about or reading just a
[1:55:11] little experts or comments about a guy
[1:55:14] by the name of David Livingstone was a
[1:55:17] missionary to Africa and oh my talking
[1:55:19] about you talk about David Livingstone.
[1:55:21] He left a a legend. He left the legacy
[1:55:24] everywhere he went. Everybody loved him
[1:55:26] and appreciated him and what he did for
[1:55:28] the slaves and everything in Africa.
[1:55:34] I think of our own prophet, brother
[1:55:36] Brown. Wherever he went, whatever was
[1:55:39] told about him,
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; what about me and you this morning?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; What about our lives?
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; What about them?
[1:55:52] How many believes that you have got
[1:55:54] faults this morning?
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Every one of us
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; have got faults. Every one of us has
[1:56:01] made mistakes.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Some that we hate.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Some that we don't like to talk about.
[1:56:10] Like somebody said one time come by
[1:56:12] preaching for us said whatever you say
[1:56:15] and you just tell them said now we won't
[1:56:16] talk about that. That's a family story.
[1:56:21] How many's got family stories?
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; You don't let nobody know.
[1:56:27] See, but I wonder,
[1:56:30] like I said, everybody's got faults.
[1:56:33] Everybody's made mistakes.
[1:56:35] Can we overlook one another's faults
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; and pray for one another?
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; He overlooked our faults.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; We sang that song, Amazing Grace
[1:56:49] shall always be my song of praise.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; For it was grace.
[1:56:56] Hallelujah.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; He overlooked my fault and saw my need.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can look over everybody
[1:57:06] else's faults this morning and see their
[1:57:09] need. I need more of him.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I need more of his Holy Spirit this
[1:57:14] morning. I need more of his grace this
[1:57:17] morning. I need more of his love this
[1:57:19] morning.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:24] my appreciation of his mercy and his
[1:57:27] goodness. It a show. Amen. And I wanted
[1:57:31] not only to show from me, but I wanted
[1:57:33] to, like I said, I don't want to become
[1:57:35] stagnated in my life. I wanted to be
[1:57:37] able to
[1:57:40] proceed out of my life.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be unable to forgive.
[1:57:47] And I quoted that prayer
[1:57:50] that his disciples said said, "Hey,
[1:57:54] teach us to pray."
[1:57:57] Our father, it's got to become a
[1:57:59] personal relationship which art in
[1:58:01] heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
[1:58:05] kingdom come, thy will be done in earth
[1:58:08] as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
[1:58:11] daily bread. And forgive our debts
[1:58:14] as we forgive others.
[1:58:18] We owe to debt.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "For we all have
[1:58:23] sinned." David said, "I was conceived in
[1:58:26] sin, born and shaped in iniquity, come
[1:58:28] to the world speaking lies." I owed a
[1:58:31] debt be when I first came in. I owed a
[1:58:34] debt, born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[1:58:37] come to the world speaking lies. First
[1:58:39] lie I probably told was to get out of a
[1:58:41] whipping.
[1:58:45] We sang that song, I owed a debt I could
[1:58:47] not pay.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; He paid a debt he didn't owe.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the we for we all have
[1:58:53] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:58:54] God.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; For the wages of sin is what?
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; But he forgave our debts.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; What about forgiving somebody else?
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:08] You remember he tells a story in the
[1:59:10] Bible
[1:59:12] Jesus did about this guy that this man
[1:59:15] came to him said I owed him he owed him
[1:59:17] so much he couldn't pay it and he that
[1:59:20] guy forgave him of everything and then
[1:59:22] that guy that he forgave he went and
[1:59:24] found somebody that didn't owe him quite
[1:59:26] as much as he owed that other fell and
[1:59:28] he wouldn't forgive him.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; I want goodness and mercy to flow out of
[1:59:35] my life.
[1:59:37] I want to be able to forgive
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; what is it.
[1:59:44] They said we had visitors this morning.
[1:59:46] I don't know,
[1:59:48] but I don't want to be
[1:59:52] accused if somebody comes and they don't
[1:59:54] know how we operate or whatever. I don't
[1:59:57] want to be the ones that run them off or
[1:59:59] whatever. say, "Hey, is because it's
[2:00:02] lack of love
[2:00:04] or because I'm just lukewarm
[2:00:08] and people get turned off
[2:00:11] because I don't show I want to Hey,
[2:00:14] Jesus." He showed love, didn't he?
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Remember that woman when they came to
[2:00:19] him, threw him at his at his feet and
[2:00:20] said, "Hey, she was caught in a very act
[2:00:22] of adultery." The scripture, the law of
[2:00:24] Moses' law said she ought to be stoned.
[2:00:26] What you say? The Bible says he stooped
[2:00:29] down. He stooped that we might be able
[2:00:32] to be lifted up.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Can't we stoop for others? Can't we
[2:00:38] forgive others?
[2:00:41] Oh my I don't I don't want to have a
[2:00:43] lack of love. God, give me more of your
[2:00:45] love.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:00:49] You know, this this this surely this
[2:00:52] goodness and mercy, it ain't a one-way
[2:00:54] street. It's a two-way street. back.
[2:00:57] Hey, I want to proceed. I want I I want
[2:00:59] goodness and mercy and I want to be able
[2:01:01] to give goodness and mercy.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; You know, a shepherd in this book, I
[2:01:07] read this shepherd. He said, "You know
[2:01:08] what?
[2:01:10] I can look back and I can say if my
[2:01:12] sheep are if they're flush, if they're
[2:01:15] if they're flourishing and the land is
[2:01:18] flourishing and they're content, I can
[2:01:20] be a happy camper, so to speak. I can be
[2:01:24] a happy shepherd because my flocks well
[2:01:26] taken care of. They're well nourished.
[2:01:29] The land that they're uh that that is
[2:01:31] flourishing where they've been on,
[2:01:32] they're wellfed and they're real
[2:01:34] content. I wonder if God can look down
[2:01:36] from the portals of glory this morning
[2:01:38] and see us as his sheep. See us as his
[2:01:41] ch children, see us as his sons and his
[2:01:43] daughters. And he can be he can be very
[2:01:46] happy this morning and said they're very
[2:01:48] content this morning. They're wellfed
[2:01:50] this morning. They're flourishing this
[2:01:52] morning. Oh, hallelujah. Everything's
[2:01:54] producing. Amen. Everywhere they go,
[2:01:57] they're producing. Amen. They're
[2:01:59] producing the fruits of the spirit in
[2:02:00] their lives. They got love. They got
[2:02:02] joy. They got peace. They got
[2:02:04] longsuffering.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:10] That's what I want him to see in my life
[2:02:13] this morning. Isaiah 53:11 says it like
[2:02:16] this. He shall
[2:02:18] see the travail of his soul, and shall
[2:02:22] be satisfied.
[2:02:24] By his knowledge
[2:02:26] shall my righteous servant justify many,
[2:02:30] for he shall bear their iniquities.
[2:02:33] Hallelujah. He shall see the survail of
[2:02:36] soul and shall be satisfied.
[2:02:39] Is he satisfied with you this morning?
[2:02:43] I think he looks on in my life in
[2:02:44] tenderness
[2:02:46] for he loves me deeply. He loves each
[2:02:49] and every one of you this morning very
[2:02:51] deeply. He cares about each and every
[2:02:53] one of you this morning.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; And the long years
[2:02:57] that he's been taking care of each I
[2:02:59] don't know how long you've been around.
[2:03:02] Hey, some of us been been around for a
[2:03:04] long time.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Homer, he's been this way over
[2:03:09] 50 years. 1969 he said when he was
[2:03:12] baptized. My mom and dad got baptized in
[2:03:15] 1969 in Hardy, Arkansas.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Over 50 years
[2:03:24] and he's had goodness and mercy for me.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; He has he's had patience with me.
[2:03:31] There many a time that I would have gave
[2:03:33] up on myself. You'd have gave up on
[2:03:35] yourself.
[2:03:38] But hey,
[2:03:40] over the long years,
[2:03:43] he had goodness and mercy without
[2:03:45] slacking.
[2:03:48] And he longs for to see it passed on to
[2:03:51] others by me.
[2:03:55] And not only that, but also passed back
[2:03:57] to him with joy.
[2:04:00] And if he can see that,
[2:04:03] he can look back on over his throne and
[2:04:07] say, "Hey, that's my son. That's my
[2:04:10] daughter. They're the sheep of my
[2:04:12] pastor.
[2:04:14] And I'm glad that they're in the fold."
[2:04:18] Amen.
[2:04:19] Hallelujah. He longs for my
[2:04:23] love. That's what he longs for. He longs
[2:04:25] for love. My love. He longs for your
[2:04:28] love this morning.
[2:04:35] I want to say I love you Lord.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you this morning. I thank
[2:04:40] you this morning. I love him
[2:04:44] because
[2:04:46] he first loved me. Amen.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; And if he longs for my love and I can
[2:04:52] love him and pass this goodness and
[2:04:56] mercy on to others, then I believe he is
[2:04:59] satisfied this morning.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Let me read you
[2:05:06] these couple things, then we'll try to
[2:05:07] get out of here.
[2:05:10] The hidden life
[2:05:13] 1956 hidden life with Christ. God didn't
[2:05:17] put you here to work in a factory just
[2:05:18] alone.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; So if you're here working young people,
[2:05:23] you working in a factory school or
[2:05:26] whatever, he didn't put you in here
[2:05:29] just to do that alone.
[2:05:32] He put you in he put you here as a
[2:05:34] testimony,
[2:05:38] a written epistol read of all men.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; There may be people that don't even read
[2:05:43] the Bible, but they'll read your life.
[2:05:45] That's right.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; When they read your life, what are they
[2:05:47] reading this morning?
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; I hope they read Christ in mind.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "He put you here as a
[2:05:57] testimony, a written epistle read of all
[2:06:00] men to live an honorable and decent life
[2:06:04] and a hid, consecrated life with God, so
[2:06:08] that men would know that Jesus Christ
[2:06:10] still lives and reigns.
[2:06:15] When I'm at school,
[2:06:17] when I'm on the job, when I'm in the
[2:06:20] grocery, wherever I may be, I want
[2:06:22] people to know that Christ still lives
[2:06:26] and reigns.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Still lives and reigns.
[2:06:32] Amen. He said, "That's a little pinchy,
[2:06:34] but it's good. It'll help your digestion
[2:06:37] orders.
[2:06:39] It's helping mine."
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I read this, I I didn't
[2:06:44] know he said it, you know. And I read
[2:06:45] that brother David. I said, "My cuz I
[2:06:48] just before I had my surgery, he said,
[2:06:50] "Hey, this is" He said he he he said,
[2:06:52] "You hear a written epistle read over
[2:06:53] all men to live an honorable and decent
[2:06:55] life, a life consecrated to tell to so
[2:06:58] that men would know that Jesus Christ
[2:07:00] still lives and reign." He said, "That's
[2:07:01] a little pinchy, but he said it it's
[2:07:03] good. It helped your digestion orders."
[2:07:05] I said, "God, you're helping mine both
[2:07:08] naturally and spiritually." Amen. He
[2:07:11] said, you know, to take the food, right?
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz hey, I've been on a kind of a strict
[2:07:16] diet.
[2:07:18] Amen. So, hey, I I I said, man, thank
[2:07:21] you, Lord. I read that. I said, "Thank
[2:07:23] you, Lord. Let me show people that you
[2:07:25] still live in rain." Amen. It not only
[2:07:27] helped my digestion order spirit
[2:07:29] naturally, but it helped them
[2:07:30] spiritually to take the food right.
[2:07:33] Amen. When Brother Tom comes out here
[2:07:34] and he's preaching to or Brother Brad or
[2:07:36] whoever it may be, the evangelist, that
[2:07:38] you'll take the food, right? And it go
[2:07:40] down into your system and it'll digest
[2:07:43] right.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Said it fit you into a place that you
[2:07:48] can receive healing for both soul and
[2:07:50] body.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Again 1958
[2:07:56] behold I stand at the door knock
[2:08:00] and said and when you said you're if
[2:08:03] you're the salt of the earth then you
[2:08:05] got to live such a life.
[2:08:07] What does salt create? A thirst. You
[2:08:11] ever ate something?
[2:08:15] And you got so thirsty.
[2:08:18] He said, "Man, I can't get enough water
[2:08:19] to drink. Maybe it's what I got. Maybe
[2:08:21] it's what I ate." He said, "You're the
[2:08:24] salt of the earth. You got to live such
[2:08:26] a life. A written epistol to all men
[2:08:30] will know what you are
[2:08:34] professed to be." You know they say
[2:08:37] this, your life speaks so loud I can't
[2:08:39] hear your testimony.
[2:08:41] That's right.
[2:08:43] My he said sometime ago a little story I
[2:08:45] want to tell you just before that I
[2:08:47] speaking of think of the importance of
[2:08:49] Jesus at the door trying to get in to
[2:08:50] create a brotherly love. He said but
[2:08:53] your life speaks so loud that I can't
[2:08:56] hear your testimony. I want people to be
[2:08:58] able to hear my testimony. Amen.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy
[2:09:05] is following me.
[2:09:07] Amen. He said here, "Surely goodness and
[2:09:11] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[2:09:12] life and I will dwell in the house of
[2:09:16] the Lord forever."
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy. Let's stand
[2:09:20] together.
[2:09:22] Hallelujah. You love him.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; You appreciate him. Amen. You want that
[2:09:27] surely goodness and mercy. That's what I
[2:09:30] want this morning. Surely goodness and
[2:09:32] mercy shall follow me. Let's bow our
[2:09:35] heads.
[2:09:38] Heavenly Father,
[2:09:40] Lord, we love you this morning, Father.
[2:09:42] And Lord, I just love you so much, Lord
[2:09:45] Jesus. And Father, once again, just
[2:09:48] forgive me for not being
[2:09:51] maybe myself, so to speak, but taking it
[2:09:53] easy, Lord. But just
[2:09:55] Lord your prophet said if we go to the
[2:09:57] doctors we need to try to do what they
[2:09:59] say. So, Father, I'm just trying to do,
[2:10:00] but sometimes it's kind of hard, Father,
[2:10:03] just to get so excited sometimes when we
[2:10:06] see these things, Lord, and know these
[2:10:08] things, Father. And maybe this was just
[2:10:11] simple, Father,
[2:10:13] this morning, Lord. But, Father, I pray,
[2:10:16] Lord, that you'd help us, oh God.
[2:10:19] We want surely goodness and mercy.
[2:10:23] That's what we want. We don't want your
[2:10:26] judgment, Lord.
[2:10:28] We want mercy.
[2:10:31] We don't want meanness. We want
[2:10:33] goodness, Lord.
[2:10:35] We want your mercy.
[2:10:37] We want your grace, Lord.
[2:10:40] Cuz Father, we know if we would receive
[2:10:42] due dice,
[2:10:47] it'd be the grave and then a devil's
[2:10:48] hell.
[2:10:50] But Lord, we want your mercy, Father.
[2:10:54] Lord, like somebody said, and I was
[2:10:56] thinking about it, Lord, and somebody
[2:10:57] said the other day, they said,
[2:11:01] I don't know if there's ever been a book
[2:11:03] written
[2:11:05] about Barabus, Lord, what he thought.
[2:11:09] He was a murderer. He was a robber.
[2:11:13] And he went free
[2:11:17] cuz somebody took his place.
[2:11:21] And maybe he didn't realize who it was.
[2:11:25] And maybe that day on Calvary
[2:11:29] when somebody ran into them and they
[2:11:31] said, "Hey,
[2:11:33] Barabus,
[2:11:35] I thought they was going to
[2:11:38] execute you.
[2:11:40] I thought they was going to hang you on
[2:11:41] a cross." He said, "Yeah, but somebody
[2:11:43] took my place
[2:11:46] and maybe somebody heard him and they
[2:11:48] came up to him and said, "You must be
[2:11:50] that Barabbus."
[2:11:52] He said, "Yes."
[2:11:54] He said, "You was a murderer. You was a
[2:11:55] robber."
[2:11:58] He said, "But you see there on the hill
[2:12:00] that they call Galatha,
[2:12:03] there's three crosses,
[2:12:06] but there's a man in the middle."
[2:12:11] And he fell beneath his load and
[2:12:12] somebody had to carry his cross.
[2:12:16] Said, "That guy in the middle, he's the
[2:12:19] one that took your place.
[2:12:21] I wonder if he realized who that was and
[2:12:26] what he had to go through,
[2:12:29] what he had to suffer,
[2:12:32] the beat he took
[2:12:34] that Barabus should have had,
[2:12:38] the whips that went across his back, the
[2:12:42] catinetails
[2:12:45] that Barabus should have
[2:12:48] felt,
[2:12:50] but He took his place
[2:12:53] that he wouldn't have to go.
[2:12:56] And God, you took my place.
[2:12:59] Cuz if it wasn't for you, Lord,
[2:13:02] I couldn't be like David and said, "The
[2:13:04] Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[2:13:08] He maketh me to lie down in green
[2:13:10] pastures. He leadth me beside the still
[2:13:12] waters. He restoreth my soul." I
[2:13:16] couldn't say that Lord,
[2:13:20] but Father, you took my place
[2:13:23] so that I wouldn't have to go. I want to
[2:13:26] say thank you, Lord.
[2:13:29] Words can't express enough how much I
[2:13:31] love you.
[2:13:33] Now, Lord, don't let it stay and become
[2:13:35] stagnated in my life.
[2:13:38] You had goodness and your mercy, and it
[2:13:41] didn't only stop there, but it followed
[2:13:42] me all the days of my life.
[2:13:45] Lord, don't let it stop there, Lord.
[2:13:47] Don't let it become stagnated in my
[2:13:49] life, but it let it flow out of my life
[2:13:52] to others, Father, that they can know
[2:13:56] about your goodness and your mercy.
[2:13:58] That when they see me,
[2:14:01] they can know about your goodness and
[2:14:02] your mercy. Maybe I don't even have to
[2:14:05] say nothing to them, Lord,
[2:14:09] but they'll understand some of your
[2:14:10] goodness and your mercy. Grant it, Lord.
[2:14:15] Grant it, Father. Help us, Father.
[2:14:21] We don't have to worry.
[2:14:24] We don't have to
[2:14:27] care, Lord. We ain't got to care in this
[2:14:29] life because you took it all. And Lord,
[2:14:33] when troubles come, when trials come, we
[2:14:36] just cast all our cares upon you, Lord,
[2:14:39] for you careth for us.
[2:14:42] Grant it, Lord. We love you and we
[2:14:44] appreciate you. Bless your people this
[2:14:47] morning. Lord, I trust that this was
[2:14:50] something that was said that would do
[2:14:51] some good. Lord, let my life be a
[2:14:54] written epistol.
[2:14:56] When they read my life, may they read
[2:14:59] you, Lord. May they see you in my life.
[2:15:03] Not only me, but these others here this
[2:15:05] morning. Grant it, Father. For we ask
[2:15:08] these things in Jesus name. Amen. And
[2:15:11] amen. Thank you. God bless you this
[2:15:13] morning.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; And over
[2:15:21] and over
[2:15:24] he molds me and makes me
[2:15:30] into
[2:15:32] his image.
[2:15:34] He fashioned
[2:15:37] the clay,
[2:15:39] a vessel
[2:15:42] of honor
[2:15:45] I am today.
[2:15:49] And it's all because Jesus
[2:15:54] didn't throw the clay away.
[2:16:00] Over
[2:16:02] and over
[2:16:05] he molds me and makes me
[2:16:11] into
[2:16:12] his image.
[2:16:15] He fashions
[2:16:17] the clay
[2:16:20] vessel
[2:16:23] of h
[2:16:25] I am today.
[2:16:30] And it's all because Jesus
[2:16:35] didn't throw the clay away.
[2:16:41] Amen. The goodness of God.
[2:16:45] I love you, Lord,
[2:16:50] for your mercy never fails me.
[2:16:56] And all my days
[2:16:59] I've been held in your hand.
[2:17:04] From the moment that I wake up
[2:17:08] until I lay my head.
[2:17:12] Oh, I will see
[2:17:15] of the goodness of God.
[2:17:22] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:17:28] [Music]
[2:17:30] And all my life you have been so so
[2:17:35] good.
[2:17:38] With every breath that I am able.
[2:17:44] Oh, I will sing
[2:17:47] of the goodness of God.
[2:17:52] I love your voice.
[2:17:56] You have led me through the fire
[2:18:01] in darkest of nights. You are close like
[2:18:06] no other.
[2:18:09] I've known you as a father.
[2:18:13] I've known you as a friend.
[2:18:17] And I have lived
[2:18:20] in the goodness of God.
[2:18:26] Oh, and all my life you have been
[2:18:30] faithful.
[2:18:31] [Music]
[2:18:35] And all my life you have been so so
[2:18:40] good.
[2:18:43] If every breath that I am made,
[2:18:48] oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[2:18:54] Cuz all my life
[2:18:58] and all my life, you have been faithful.
[2:19:03] [Music]
[2:19:06] And all my life you have been so so
[2:19:11] good.
[2:19:14] With every breath that I am made.
[2:19:19] Oh, I will sing
[2:19:22] of the goodness of God.
[2:19:27] Oh, I will sing
[2:19:30] of the goodness
[2:19:32] of God. One more time this morning. Oh,
[2:19:35] I will sing
[2:19:38] of the goodness
[2:19:41] of God.
[2:19:43] Amen. Has he been good to you this
[2:19:45] morning? Amen. It's been good to be
[2:19:47] here. We're going to dismiss this
[2:19:49] morning. Let's just sing as we go. I'm
[2:19:51] amazed that you love me.
[2:19:55] I'm amazed
[2:20:00] that you love me.
[2:20:04] And I'm amazed
[2:20:09] and how you
