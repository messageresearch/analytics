amen so praise the lord god is good i can't think of any announcements or anything so let's just bow our heads to go before the lord in prayer lord jesus once again father we come before your throne of grace lord jesus thank the lord jesus for the precious blood of jesus christ that enables us to come before you the word says that we can come fully before you lord jesus and bringing our request lord jesus and father we just thank you lord for your mercy and for your grace lord we can't lord just thank you enough and lord for all that you mean and what what all you do for us every day lord we just ask god that you'll bless the lord the meditation of our heart tonight lord and bless each one that has come out lord jesus bless their efforts lord and those that are out there listening we ask god you'd be with them lord and that you would bless their hearts lord jesus with the word tonight and help me lord just to get out of the way and use the gift god that you've placed your lord and operate it lord jesus and we'll just give you the praise the honor and the glory in jesus name amen and amen if you will turn your bibles amen i have several scriptures here amen and i think we'll start with perhaps let's go with romans 4 romans 4. and we'll go with one through eight what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining unto the flesh is found for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh it is reward is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him to justify the ungodly his faith being counted for righteousness even as david also describes the blessedness of man unto whom the lord unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered amen blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sick and be seated my mind uh i feel like the lord just [Music] laid this on my heart to speak on on assurance i want to call i'm going to title this covered by the blood but i want to take that word covered for a minute amen how many knows that that covered according to brother branham he said he he said that the word religion means covering amen it means a covering amen so if we're covered by something it means that we're under something amen we're taken care of so to speak and it reminded me of having perhaps an insurance policy in that right and being covered by insurance policy and all the things that a insurance policy will cover you amen and when you are under the blood under christ or in christ there is a lot of things that's covered how many believe that a lot of things it's covered and tonight i want to speak speak to you with the help of the lord about some of those things that are covered and some things that are covered and some of uh takes few illustrations of a few characters through the bible amen of of that were uh blessed amen and i guess right here's a good one to start with because david talked about the blessedness of man amen how many believe you're blessed to be under the blood of jesus christ david was blessed now i'm going to go for a minute into the old testament because we know that uh in the old under the old testament they would sacrifice sheep and whatever god required right and every year they had to come and they had to make sacrifices they had to continuously do it after year after year after year and they were all and those sins were only covered by the blood amen one place i believe the prophet god said they weren't forgiven they were still there and those that died could go into a place called paradise but they couldn't go on up into the presence of god until christ came that's why when christ came and when he paid the ultimate price that's when the substitute and all of that was taken care of by the blood and they could go out of paradise up into the presence of god amen and so it was just a covering in the old testament but in the new testament under christ it is a much deeper uh much deeper thought a man and much richer application in our lives it's not just not just covered but it's also completely done away with amen praise the lord you know and one of the first things that we look at is adam and eve after the fall we know that they covered themselves with fig leaves huh fig leaves they covered themselves and there was a religion but it was a man-made religion right and when god come down those fig leaves weren't good enough huh just think about it those fig leaves i mean they were covered their bodies probably no nakedness they were they were covered you think well that's modest huh but no it wasn't wasn't what god wanted that's not what was asking for he knew that because of their sin they couldn't even come before him they couldn't even communicate with him unless there's a sacrifice made that is for the sin that they committed and so god we know that he took a lamb in that right and killed that lamb and dressed them in lambskins and so when they went walking through the garden they're not even crying but at least they could have an audience at least they could communicate with god and we know that all through the old testament god would communicate man with man because of a substitute amen which was a figure of the lamb of god that was going to take away the sins of the world amen so praise the lord amen we think about david and think about how and it's simply amazing how what what the blood of jesus christ amen we'll cover first of all amen as like i said i'ma just kind of take this in a little bit different way than what perhaps what we're used to but in colossians 2 and verse 2 it says that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto now this is assurance that we're looking for unto all riches of the full assurance not insurance even though in the interpretation under siri talks about the assurance being the same as insurance amen it's assurance in other words if i assure you of something uh i'm i i'm making it good amen that's what insurance is amen it's you know if he was in a wreck amen and that what is the first thing that somebody's gonna ask are you gonna ask the other person do you got insurance or are you covered right are you covered are you covered do you have insurance and uh yeah we ain't got nothing to worry about i got real insurance i got real good real good insurance then again well i'm glad for that huh and so you think about it you know covered by where and here he talks about unto the riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ amen hebrews 10 it says it this way he says let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance amen in full assurance of faith having a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience in our bodies washed with pure water and let us hold fast a profession in our faith without wavering for his faithful who has promised now how many knows that our assurance is in god tonight amen and you can relax amen how many knows when you're driving down the road and you don't have insurance huh and you almost wreck into a lamborghini hundred thousand dollar car you're gonna be sweating oh man i'm nervous but you know it's the same way in life you go throughout if you go through life without endurance of faith and having god in your heart you ought to be nervous i mean that's how the world are the whole world is nervous because they don't have that assurance when you have that assurance amen i believe they call it in a song that said blessed assurance jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine it's a blessed thing to have assurance like this to be covered by the blood amen praise the lord so he talks here amen in romans there he says in cautions and also hebrews now i was going to read the whole chapter there of hebrews but we won't but we know that it teaches there in hebrews the 10th chapter that the law had a shadow of good things to come amen but could never those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually could never make the comers there unto perfect in other words it could may never make them what they were supposed to be amen let me tell you something any man-made religion any substitute will never bring you to the place that you need to be it'll never give you the peace or the comfort that you need to have no substitute will ever do it and how many knows this world our religious world is covered with substitutes amen we have millions of so-called christians that have fig leaf religion in other words this is how i feel to do it huh kind of like cain right cain he said he offered the sacrifices he was religious amen he went to church because he people like to feel like they're okay so they do stuff but that doesn't make them okay doesn't it there's only one thing that'll make you okay and that is if you do it like abel did because he's god said to cain he said do it like able it and i'll accept that because he did it right way that's where we find that millions will be disappointed on the day of judgment you'll think well didn't i do this yeah but you went with a substitute amen but we want to be so careful to make sure that we are under not like this here i like that word full assurance not liability but full assurance how many likes full insurance how about if you're driving around in a brand new vehicle and and you go up to the insurance company only a stupid person would say i want liability on this eagle it's okay to say amen amen my teacher my teacher well years ago she said many hands she says i want to teach you something many hands make light work and i was at the mommy's boy i was like what in the world does that riddle me and he said well i didn't say that but i thought and i was like i have no idea what how many hands make light work i mean she says that means if you have a lot of people and then pulling on something it makes it much lighter well tonight i thought well we have a lot fewer people so you're going to have to pull a little harder tonight mean believe that that's right but it takes pulling from the holy spirit amen praise be to god oh my full coverage hallelujah i praise the lord how many is glad for full coverage i'm glad for full assurance you don't have to just wonder because the bible even talks about all those old testament days anybody that come up to death was always kind of worried about death always a little scared of death because they couldn't come into it with the confidence that you and i can come into it now amen they always fear death but you don't i don't have to fear death now because we know that our sins are not just under a blanket somewhere not just put away but they're completely divorced i believe that's the way the of god did not just put it away but they're completely annihilated aren't you glad that let me see here here it is we'll pick up on hebrews the ninth eighth chapter and maybe verse seven for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place for have been sought for a second in other words if that sin would have worked if that covering would have worked then we wouldn't need nothing else right if it had been perfect well you wouldn't have need to christ so it wasn't perfect that's what the bible's saying here for finding fault with them he said behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and without of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand and let them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord amen i will put my laws not on a table like he did moses right no he's not going to put it on the table but where is god's law now i will write them in their hearts i want you to know that every believer every christian has god's commandments written in their hearts why do you think that when you do something wrong that scripture will come up to you that is what pops up in your mind or before you do something wrong it'll come up and it'll it'll it'll come right to you brother bible doesn't have to be there my brother my sister nobody else has got to be there closer hey now you shouldn't do that no you got something in here that tells you you know what the word says about it how many clap for that write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest and i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i just cover up and bring up later on oh their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more i mean believe that if your sins have been forgiven if god does not impute iniquity to you you're a blessed person because i believe that god has a god has the ability to to to hold you accountable for your sins or he can forgive you amen because even paul said that he was a blasphemer he worked against god and so forth but the bible says he died but i did it ignorantly if god would have chose to he could have held him accountable for it god ever held you accountable for it but you'd be done one of the things that once is one of the things that god determines is whether or not you blaspheme against the holy ghost amen that can be as simple as making fun of a sister's hair in church or the way they dress or speaking in tongues or something that the holy ghost does when the holy ghost comes and does this you speak against that amen when you do speak against what the holy spirit does it can be blasphemy amen because you remember um i believe it was judas that wept bitterly and so forth repented and put his silver back to him and that right threw his silver back and went out and cried and wept everything there was no forgiveness amen that's why my friends you and i aren't a judge sometimes people will do things that you might think hey that looks like blasphemy huh but it's up to god he's a judge amen so we see here i like that i will remember no more amen in that he saith a new covenant he hath made first now that which decayeth and wax is old is ready to vanish away amen praise the lord all right so you look at that and let's talk about for a little bit let's look at uh david first of all david we like to preach him as the man after god's own heart we love to preach about david when he went out there by faith and salute goliath mighty acts that he did saul that killed his thousands but they wrote songs about david killing his ten thousands and david you know of course we know saul heard that songs that they wrote he was jealous he was jealous of david and he would one he tried to kill him but we find in david he knows that if god would have imputed the iniquity and the bad that david did he wouldn't have been around very long because even his own pronouncement and judgment upon the man that took that one little lamb and killed it isn't that right the rich man and so forth you know and he says well he shall surely die that was his judgment he says no samuel he says david you're the man that did that you took the right uriah he was nothing he was just a little guy but he was faithful and that's all he had and you took what he had first of all we know that it was adultery involved hello adultery murder huh you know sometimes we think oh well i tell you what i just don't think the lord can forgive me let me tell you god is able to there's a lot that's covered under it but god forgave david didn't he god forgave david sure he punished him for what he did and so forth but he didn't kill him because that's what he deserved amen but he knew what it was like to be under that blood and he was covered and god was watching over him and now the other one that i don't even hardly like to talk about there's one so much until you know you almost wonder whether he would be deserving of heaven at all and most people had a question about whether this guy ever made it to heaven or not it was a man that disobeyed god he was a king and in the first commandment the first thing that he was supposed to do he didn't obey it and ever since he didn't obey it god sent an evil spirit on him and he was tormented all his life he tried to kill david time and time again his name was saul right time and then after god's after notice this because it was a strong penalty for touching god's anointed you speak or do anything towards god's anointing it's usually a real strong penalty for something like that it was so strong that day but whenever he got the opportunity to kill saul he says i can't kill i can't touch god's anointed scripture says touch not mine anointed do my prophets no harm that right remember the i'm not sure i don't think it was a malachite but it was somebody that had come into the camp of israel and when saul actually uh i think i saw that it fell on his sword and tried to kill himself but he wouldn't die didn't quite kill him didn't quite get the job done and i ordered him to get jump on him and kill him because he didn't want to be killed by the enemy so the young man did and he came back and bragged about it today hey he told me to do it he wouldn't have lived anyway the young man said so i went ahead and i did what saul said and you know it got him killed right david later on says fall on him his own mouth testifies against him he touched god's anointed huh but what i thought about you know and all the things that solved it speak of all he did most people think that saul didn't make it and we wouldn't know whether he wouldn't know unless that a prophet in our age would have told us that right because you to think deny he can't make it we don't but you know the way that he knows the way that the private says and we know that he did is because when he went to find out whether he would win a war and so forth and he was inquiring of the lord the lord wasn't even answering the man anymore isn't that right so he went to the witch of endor was it you know he went up there and the witch and and so forth i want you to summon me up a spirit and and sure enough she summoned samuel up and she didn't realize maybe who it was going to be because after she was sum it up she says man you didn't tell me it was going to be him she didn't want no part of it but she pulled samuel up and there he was in his mantle isn't that right there he was and he says why have you brought me up and so forth he wanted to inquire whether he's gonna you know win the war and the way that we know that he made it is because the lost and the damned aren't in the same place and samuel told saul tomorrow you're going to be with me and tomorrow you're going to be with me where i am that's where you're going to be somebody knows god knows he's a judge but you think about the sins the things that even the substitute blood will cover amen how many knows that if our president chose to completely pardon the worst prisoner out there he could that president has the power to pardon who he wants i don't know how full extent of it but he can pardon me because he's the president and i'm gonna tell you aside this right now god's the same way he can pardon who he wants is that right amen we're not going to have time to go through all of them but amen how about jacob how many knows brother bam called him a little shyster he was a little deceiver he was a deceiver in a conniver and everything else and and stole the birthright from his brother when he got in the pinch and he was hungry you know for ebola journey abroad while he was deceiving and his father-in-law and all of that and getting all his cattle and great substance and everything else i think that's partially where he called jew a jew you know i i don't know i remember up in uh uh ohio there used to be a uh a jew up there guessing they try to make money any way they can right they go after that mighty dollar even the jews in wall street and everything else and we used to call them mute in german it's you that's all i uh you know he'll he'll take you for the last hour if you can you know and i guess you know it comes from perhaps early ninja whatever and that pardon but you know you know we call them jews but there's a lot of white folk whatever jews do it is that right but anyway jacob he was a real shyster he was a deceiver and everything else and and so forth and when he came back he was scared of what esau was going to do to him because of what he had done and he knew he had an army and everything else and so that night we know that uh jacob got in contact with the angel of the lord amen he was worried and so forth and and he wrestled with that angel all of that time huh that whole night he wrestled with the lord he wanted him to bless him amen we can't wrestle for five minutes with the lord sometimes when we want a blessing but anyway we know that he wrestled with the lord and and and i guess the angel grabbed the hole of his hip or something and and you know he finally blessed him and so forth but after that jacob could never walk right or should we say never walk the same way he walked right after that and after that his name was changed from jacob the scheister to the prince with god israel huh that's where israel comes from it's look at what god forgave for him look at look at what god forgave what he covered even under the old testament the things that were covered praise the lord amen let's come up a little bit let's come on up to perhaps the woman at the well huh the woman at the well as the prophet said you know she had to go out to the well at a sec at a different time because all the decent ladies with their daughters and everything that they had and they just didn't want their kids and to mingle with the prostitute she had to come out at a different time amen and and jesus somehow he sent the disciples away didn't he sent them to go get riddles there he was with this woman by herself which wasn't really all that not so wise as what we would call it today for a preacher to be with a a prostitute buyers even by himself but anyway when they come back you know he says you know this woman and so forth did you get food and so forth but in that time frame we know that he got the contact with it and asked for a drink and she said it's not right for a jew to ask a samaritan so forth you know for a drink or whatever you know we have to search customs this saturday but if you knew who you was talking to you'd ask me for a drink right because i give you the drink you'll never thirst again this is where we get the great fountain of water amen a well springing up into everlasting life that you never thirst again amen and she says give me this drink and what did he do he discerned her thoughts intense of her heart that was giving her the drink that she desired she realized that he was the messiah remember she said we know when messiah comes he'll do these things i am he is that right and furthermore you know she says you know go call your husband and so forth and then she said uh she says i've man got no husband yeah you're right you ain't got one but you the one you're with now is your fifth in other words she's living with them like husbands hello folks let me tell you something you let a woman like that nowadays how would you look at her huh but jesus himself had mercy because why because there was something down in here i mean knows that's what makes the difference that's what makes you blessed is because down in here that woman didn't really desire to be that way and he knew it she was a child of god the prophet of god said she had representation in her heart because jesus never did anything until the father showed him first it was the father that told him exactly what to do where to be and who to talk to amen now i'll just mention this i didn't look up the scriptures but remember i believe her name was mary i believe it is that washed his feet and with her hair and so forth and before she did all of that she went and took her prostitute money the alabaster box right took that money and went bought the finest perfumes that she possibly could buy you know and and even the according to the way the prophet put it you know maybe even the one selling it to her didn't really want to sell it to her but i got the money so she i'll go ahead and give you that and that you know and then when she came and she anointed him with that oil and so forth the disciples said couldn't this have been sold for a great price and we could have given it to the poor and he said she did it for my burial the very anointing that was going to bury him and so forth amen you come from that type of money you say well that's some dirty money let me tell you something ain't dirty when god's cleaning it because that woman was doing it in repentance isn't that right she was repenting and she was asking for forgiveness when god cleanses something it is clean amen even his burying god himself amen it's like a little heart for us humans our self-righteousness i understand but i want you to know the blood of jesus christ has the power to clean the vilest sinner amen a vile sinner amen let's uh i got two stories here i want to read the one is about lady macabee y'all remember the story brother baby says here a few years ago all religions of the world met and i believe it was in london england he says and when there was all speaking of different churches and mohammedans and buddhists and everything a little old fellow that represented christianity american holiness church john witt i believe was his name so then when he got up to his time to speak all the religions represented in this great gathering he told the story of lady maccabee how low she was got arrested in the oklahoma smoking a cigar and driving and passed the speed that she's supposed to with all of the horses and so forth amen with the stagecoach she done so many murders and filthy and ornery until they went to tar and feather her they wouldn't even put their hands on her afraid they'd be polluted real low down woman and he got and he told the story in such a dramatic way till it got every listener on the ends of their seats he's a gentleman of the and the religions of this world has your religion got anything that would clean the hands of lady maccabee nobody said the word he jumped up in the air and he kicked his heels together slapped his hands again the blood of jesus christ won't only clean her hands but it'll clean her heart amen no matter how vile how dirty it can clean listen he says again the blood of jesus christ will take the lowest prostitute in louisville kentucky and make a lady a saint out of her it'll take a bootlegger out there and a place down yonder and make a gentleman out of him and a saint of god amen this is my friend citizens of the kingdom my fellow men of kentucky and indiana and around about don't you think tonight is about time for you to consider this lord jesus before your last chance is taken amen brother braham says some time ago he says i was speaking at a businessman's breakfast and i believe it was in puerto rico someone said to me he says what you you aren't you a preacher why are you hanging with these businessmen that's what i am a businessman you know what kind of ins what kind of business are you in he says insurance and he said what kind of insurance are you selling or insurance you know about the same sounds about the same i said blessed assurance life insurance and i said if you're interested in the policy i'd sure like to talk it over with you hey amen how many believe it that's what brother ann says he's selling assurance blessed assurance jesus is mine one day a friend of mine one more schneider he was a very good buddy of mine we chummed up he was selling prudential life insurance probably a lot of us have life insurance don't we amen i know i do uh you know and he came to my house and he said billy i'd like to talk to you about some insurance that says i have assurance and he says oh pardon me and i said i said i didn't know billy said i believe your wife told me that you didn't have any oh and i said i have my wife looked at me and said and as if what's happened to him and she looked at me and said billy and that says why sure honey i got insurance i never said insurance i said assurance amen and i said i got assurance wilmer schneider said to me he says you know what insurance are you with billy i said blessed assurance jesus is mine what a foretaste of glory divine i'm an heir of salvation purchased of god born of his spirit washed in his blood i'm just glad to be washed let me tell you something the blood of jesus christ will wash you white it'll clean you and it'll take the desire for sin away i hope everybody listen everybody listening here tonight and out there if your faith in god hasn't taken you so deep and you haven't got filled with the holy ghost so much until that desire has left you're not deep enough yet amen was thinking this week how david said i keep the lord always before us how many believes and we talked on what was we talked about on sunday on on priorities if we keep christ in front of you all the time there's no temptation can come to you there's nothing the devil can put in front of you until it faces him first because he's in front of you amen it has to come through him amen lord help us so remember that take the desire of it away make sin has to look ugly to you not pretty not sexy not tempting no ugly and terrible then you are where you should be because uh under the new covenant it takes the desire of sin away all right where was why oh so that's right he says i got assurance he says what insurance do you have blessed insurance jesus is mine he said that's really nice brother really i appreciate that said but he says i got a brother preacher you know to all brother howard and i says yes and he said billy but that won't put you in the graveyard amen there's a lot of people worried about making sure that they have enough funds to get buried right maybe have a little insurance policy to get buried but he says yeah i know but it will get me out how many is that that how many that's a whole lot more important than going in it's a whole lot more important to have the kind of assurance that you're going to come out of there we'll get you buried one way or the other but let's just make sure that you've got the policy that's going to get you out of there are you with me tonight i want the policy that's going to bring me out and you can only have that policy if you're filled with the baptism of the holy spirit your life dedicated to god and when you have been born again oh my i got to thinking about this you know jesus says all that come to me i will in no wise cast out and nobody can pluck them out on my hands how many when you're truly saved you got assurance you don't have to worry about being lost because you know as much as i do the devil likes to play games with our minds whether or not we're going to make it or whether you're good enough huh so many people probably don't go on with god because they don't feel like they're worthy i was thinking you know god has taken us who were nothing but a worm taking us up out of that dirt that deep mirey clay that we were wiggling around in and he's made us sons and daughters of god higher than the angels you know you're higher in higher authority angels because angels are servants servants serve the son sons and daughters that's higher than servants he's taken us from worms to sons and daughters of god just like he could have i don't know that he ever did take this lady maccabee but i'll tell you he can take the most violent sinner you know who would one of the most violent sinner was was paul paul was a real vile sinner he condoned to the murderer of stephen folks the christians were scared perhaps of a pilot uh uh caesar or some of them they were a little worried about but not as much as they were about paul because paul was actively throwing them in prison and coming after them in other words he says i'm coming after you gods i'm gonna throw you in jail y'all are a bunch of heretics because that's what he thought the christians were persecuting the church of god and going and taking the coats and and keeping track of the coats as they going stone stephen he was part of it he was guilty of it amen next to blasphemy until paul says god came into this world to save sinners how many believe that of whom i am chief he says how much i'm the chief center i was so i was so zealous in what i was doing but it was absolutely the wrong thing i was persecuting the very weight it was righteous and so forth how many knows the first church a lot of folks didn't believe it nah not paul you mean god is called paul i mean he took his arch enemy god can take his arch enemy and turn him around and make him serve him that's what he did to fall he can forgive all of that a lot of those church folks probably didn't one i never gave him they were scared of him but it took the confirmation of the prophets different ones no paul really is on our side now he is really not going to kill you or or throw you in jail paul said he was the chief of sinners amen let's go to another scene brother banham was up in ohio having services isn't that right and he did like he was hungry and the main restaurant was closed in between services somewhere and he went over there to this little shocky place and he didn't realize from what i could tell it pretty much describes the bar that i used to go to all right he come in there and they were playing the jukeboxes there all drinking beer and everything else and he rises this is a terrible place isn't that right he see the policeman over there playing slot machines and he says it's illegal to have slot machines and gamble in ohio hit that cop was breaking the law amen ill had his arm around some young girl as ill badly dressed and everything else and all kinds of bad stuff going on in there and there was some old woman that was in a in a a in a seat from what i understand with some men there and had all kinds of crazy looking hair and and eye shadow or whatever just looked terrible arms just you know when you get old i'm sorry but it just don't stay tight it gets all flabby right and she had flabby arms just uglier than sinned pretty much and and they're flirting trying to pick up guys you know and boy he just didn't think about a whole lot of it he was standing there criticizing and thinking god why don't you just how can you stand this right how can you stand this why don't you just wipe this off the face of the earth and something said to me come on over here to one side i want to talk to you he says that was my boss and when i went over there it just seemed like it come before me and like a vision and i've seen this and he says seems like i could see the world and around the world was a rainbow and that rainbow represented the blood of jesus christ that right and if that blood would not listen closely if that blood would ever leave there god couldn't look at this world another second why do you think homosexuality why do you think all of that terrible things that's going on the mass murdering just yesterday again all of the terrible the our politicians huh it's hard to believe it isn't it but our wickedness of our politicians that's right because most of them are wicked that's right uh and then they go to church and you know and they think they're okay with god why are they gonna have a surprise killing babies is okay you reckon that's gonna be all right on that day no it's not huh all kinds of the whole world is in the sodom condition if that blood of christ would ever leave god would look on it he would see it it would be in his presence do you think god's going to live with all that he would destroy it annihilate it immediately but that's why we're still here that's why he hasn't destroyed it yet because that blood is there because how many knows he died for the sins of the whole world that's what he died for that's the power of his blood all the way from cain all the way to the last one no matter how bad it is outside of what god says as far as blasphemy and so forth it's powerful enough to wash it all away amen and as long as it's there we're covered we have like a bumper brother ram said isn't that right he destroyed the blood of jesus christ is the only thing that keeps the wrath of off of us tonight amen that's the truth if it wasn't for there for that there would be no more world in five minutes time from now god cannot look in the face of sin and the reason he can't see the world is because of the blood of jesus christ holding that's in all and if god could look in on a scene such as that it'll be finished he's too holy for that and then here's what come to me i thought to see the blood of jesus i acted as a bumper on a car he says every he saw his sins coming up there and every time his sins had come up there it bumped and jesus go crying and just weeping and bleeding and you know it's the blood of jesus christ all of his suffering was for your sins and for my sins and i thought that's the blood of jesus it's like a bumper and i thought oh my here i go to criticizing that woman i may not have did that but may have uh not have acted like that policeman was acting but yet in the sight of god i was a sinner just as bad as they was nami knows that he's seen all of his sins now let me just let me just read it the woman's sitting there sin is sin that's all doesn't matter no matter what your morals are you're a sinner you're just a sinner and so i thought god yes and god would have destroyed me if it hadn't been for the blood of jesus christ keeping my sins from his presence then something said to me he said yes i forgive you but you wanted to get that murder i seen my sins and the one day i crawled up to him i seen an old book laying there had william branham at the top of all kinds of things wrote on it and i said oh lord i'm so sorry i've caused it amen and i've seen the sweat coming down off of his face and so forth you know what he realized that his sins is the ones that had put him there and then he says here you are i forgave you but you want to condemn them so i just thought man look at the atmosphere of that bar look at the terrible atmosphere in there you wouldn't think that god would just let that oak go by huh i'll say go by because he knew there was a woman in there that was his child amen and so even that if you think about it god's power is enough it means uh to take and to be patient with human beings you and i we don't tend to be real patient with each other you let somebody do one little thing about we're ready to condemn them all all up and down isn't that the truth we have to be careful in that because we make mistakes we have faults all the time that if it wasn't for that blood covering us we'd be in a lot of trouble i'm just glad for a forgiving god that forgives you of your sins you repent to god cover it by the blood it goes into the sea of his forgetfulness never to be remembered no more so if god can be merciful to people like that i believe he can be a merciful to anybody if they'll just accept what he did but he had the wrong he had the wrong attitude didn't he the attitude that you know he was holy and this is so unholy that oh my brother says that changed my attitude and then what did he do he went over there to that woman said hello to her how do you do ma'am can i sit down or whatever he says oh i'm already with somebody you know what she said yeah well i don't mean it in that way brother brown says but just now i was condemning a lot of people in here and and the way that everybody's doing and this is what the lord showed me that says are you brother banham she said are you here having the meetings and she began to cry and how that she used to be with the lord and all that had happened brother man says god will take you back they had a big old-fashioned prayer meeting right there in the barn he led her to the lord i believe you're not going to get to see her don't you i believe it amen over the blood of jesus christ the power that it has the forgiving power of whatever it might be amen aren't you glad for his grace for his mercy amen i certainly am thankful for it and for the heaven the assurance in your heart blessed assurance that when you do trip then when you wreck when you fail that you can go before the blood of jesus christ and say god forgive me amen because you're covered god will cover that i mean god is here to cover your mistakes our false all little little faults that we have he's there it's covered by the blood brother brown says as long as you're repenting when you do things he says you're you're perfect in the sight of god why because it's going right under the blood amen amen i'm thankful for his grace thank you for his mercy don't ever let the devil tell you you're not worthy sir if you look at yourself we aren't worthy we're nothing but worm but we're not looking at that we're looking at the blood of jesus christ he is worthy and he has made you worthy amen he has raised you up from a life of sin amen in that bar or whatever it might be or or like paul persecuting or saul that was way out of line or david and all of that god will raise you up out of that and forgive you amen pick you up make you a son and daughter of god to serve him every day of your life amen i love it because nowadays when you have those sins go before him and we know that justified means so as though you never did it in the first place it goes in the sea of his forgetfulness what if god remembered your failures here in the last week or two maybe yesterday maybe today if he would remember him then he'd still be accountable but when he forgives you they go into the sea of forgetfulness like brother baptist says a little ink amen i believe it was it's this in isaiah 1 it says come let us reason together though your sins be a scarlet they shall be as white as no they be crimson red like crimson amen or like your brother says you have a big old stain on your shirt you usually take oil and stuff from gas or something try to get out of it and just made it bigger but with the clorox bleach it says it sends it right back to its original form and that's what the blood of jesus christ does and it goes right back to where he comes from and he can't never see it no more drop a drop of ink into a cup of bleach and it'll go away and you'll never see it again i seen the brother one time illustrating what bleach will do and and he would pour a little coke or pepsi in it and kill pour coke and pepsi in this and it hardly ever you could never tell that he's changed color you just go take it take take it right out amen god come up with the bleach that takes the stain sin has left a crimson stain on us didn't it he washed it what is snow now you can have fellowship with him how many is glad for that stand with me tonight musicians if you'll come amen how many believes that god can take he can make the vilest sinner vile a sinner clean don't think he can forget not forgive you it's the devil's business to get in our minds and think you can't be forgiven for that huh have you murdered anybody you haven't done that not that big yet have you well let's hope you don't but we condemn ourselves when we should condemn ourselves never brother um for sometimes and the devil how many knows the devil tries to work in our minds to continue to condemn us maybe for our past amen amen with your head spout if there's anybody here that has trouble with your past you keep remembering and it keeps bothering you and you'd like to make just say god help me to know that it's under the blood and i don't have to worry about that lord jesus tonight we come before you lord and we know we all have a past we all have sins of the past lord that the devil tries to bring up but i ask god tonight that you help us after knowing lord of the power of your blood and what it can cover lord that lord our past is covered we're covered lord because we've brought it all under the blood everything that we could we possibly could we made right we made everything right we repented lord and we've put it under the blood of jesus christ lord right now as we stand here lord and before we go into another song or two we ask lord if we've committed any sins today lord we ask god that you'll forgive us lord jesus and cleanse us make us white lord jesus so that we can have continued fellowship with you bless each and every one right now lord in jesus name amen amen god bless you brother josh
