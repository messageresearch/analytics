========================================

[Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] this morning uh [Music] is covered all right unto the lord our hiding place thou shalt preserve me from thou shalt compassion devour r god um 23rd chapter i had an experience yesterday you know how many of you had those experiences before you started [Music] several hours later i happen to go back and do it and do it the right way and that's the same way you know people sometimes in our lives help us to do this and then we'll take over everyone knows what takes over now reasoning away from melody take over and then several situations later you'll go back and say well i should have done this at this time and things would have been whole much better you know being less this is going to give you and you know you should listen to it but if that voice is you know like a you're a film but that line was reflected off of god's word and you know you should be doing that um mean i'm going to read this whole chapter pretty wrong i mean i'll probably read the first verse here but i was thinking this morning uh i'll let you agree that's been said jesus because of all the food and to the disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in both his teeth all therefore whatsoever they need you to observe that observe and do but do not be having their work for they say [Applause] shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their things that's a that's a lot of like photography they like putting burdens on them but for all their work when they've seen a man they make broader they give my conscience [Music] upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven maybe you be called master for one of your masters few chapters here but i was thinking this morning let me go back here what's the difference between the disciples and the pharisees and what's the difference between you and any other believer in the world that we live in and that's that's life you know the world is full of darkness and the only difference between you and everyone else god is showing a blind [Applause] these scriptures that deal in it's not a physical document but the spirit of god and that the world that we live in is pretty darn plain sort of spiritual and uh worldly pathogens where people just don't want to see the truth and just prefer to live in their lives the way they are but i'll just read some scriptures here that deal with that and it's if you have constantine references on page 13 and in isaiah the 59th chapter on the 10th first and the only place for us to be is in the light of the gospel for the hour of the living and then in matthew 15 chapter 14 i just jesus tell them about the religious beliefs that they choose to be blind and controlling truth you know you can't you can't make them believe something they just have to reach out to faith and believe it let them alone be making fun of the body but i was thinking about these two scriptures in corinthians here uh it goes on to say here in of uh second corinthians of corinthians 3rd chapter and the 14th verse but if their minds were blinded drawn to this day remaining the same veil i'm taken away in the reading of the old testament which mel has done away in christ well you decide to stop vlogging this morning because you're not in a system where it doesn't let you receive anything you choose yourself and he goes on saying second corinthians the fourth chapter and the fourth in whom the god of this world has blinded their minds of them which believe not least the life of the glory of the gospel of christ who is the innocent of god should shine for them this morning between you and you're not believing god to shine this light onto you and in your heart and then ephesians before jacob in the 18th verse having me understand dartmouth being an alienated from the life of god figures in them because of the blindness of their hearts you know just a couple problems this morning i really don't have a lot to say you know there's no difference between you and a man next court other than god right on them you uh you just got to believe that it's the word of god and resonate effect you know i'm thinking there was pointing out sitting over there uh i forget to make sure that that says the difference between a believer there's two types of believers the one that's kind of reason everything out before you believe it and the other one that when you read distributed didn't believe it and move it in and we all have our different ways that we are there's that one first you know you've got to see everything you've got to put everything together just right for him to believe and then the other one it just it may just receive it and just believe it he was talking about it's like two kids when you get on the tour press the board it gives people a support there's only that one boy that has to take it all apart put it back together he's working play with it there's the other one that's the same way the bottom of this or wherever your eyes it's just the truth you just believe it and you have fun and if you play it there's always one when you get something because they have to figure it out before they can play with it and the other one you get the same choice you have love him this morning amen god is good isn't he am i stand and sing that little course if we could this morning glory glory hallelujah since i laid my burdens down this morning amen where glory glow grey oh [Music] glory glory hallelujah oh since i laid mine [Music] oh so much better since i laid my burdens down yes i'm feeling [Music] so i much my burden down you're feeling better this morning well glory glory oh hallelujah [Music] glory glory oh hallelujah since i laid my burden down yes i'm feeling oh yes i'm feeling what's so much better since i lay my burdens down o glory glory [Music] this morning well i love him better every day oh i love him better every day and close by his side [Music] every day oh i love him better every day and close by his side before [Music] well i'm so glad that jesus set me free well i'm so glad that jesus set me free oh i'm so glad that jesus set me free singing glory hallelujah jesus set me free will o satan had me bound but jesus set me free will o satan [Music] but jesus set me free singing glory hallelujah jesus set me free and now i'm on my way to heaven and i'm shouting victory oh yes i'm on my way to heaven victory well i'm on my way to heaven shouting victory singing glory hallelujah oh jesus are you glad this morning well i'm so

be in the house of the lord this morning and amen i appreciate it sunday school and you know i i have to agree with brother brian i i have found every time i don't listen to that small voice i'm kicking myself because why you know it's never wrong when the lord speaks to your heart it's best that you listen and sometimes i haven't but i'm just glad that his grace is sufficient this morning

that'll be all for the music thank you all amen and so brother tommy he texted me something the other day that i really liked i know that the lord kind of give him a little revelation amen and so i asked him if he just give a little testimony again this morning amen so he's at 5 10 minutes or something like that and and come on up you know and share with us this morning perhaps what the lord is amen amen dealt with you and blessed you with amen and so the scripture talks somewhere when we come together whatever he says in the church somebody has a psalm or somebody has a revelation or so forth so i think it's good for us to amen have a testimony for the lord don't you amen brother tom god bless you amen uh [Applause] uh glory uh [Applause] [Music] [Music] what you're talking about you know let's say they can go away you [Applause] down here all i could do was die and suddenly god freaked me i know testimony when i was like singing that and then you know oh my god you know i'm like saying you're sharing my story you know talk to people with the way you've done it so good to me this for salvation and gave me a real hope of real life and a closer world with him that i've been praying for and now i have a peace to pass in other words [Music] amazing you know the piece of the way it is but you know just finding things to do in life you know riding motorcycles fitness and things man you know it's all good but no matter what your job is you know scripture says [Music] [Applause] [Applause] you know you know [Music] you um down there for some reason it seems like i know the last couple of winters have got to go down there and so it kind of i don't know what it is but um uh [Music] be with us this morning let us get the symbol ourselves together in your name lord jesus we have god the holy spirit's our hearts and the life lord we're going to thank you for all the love [Applause] [Music] [Music] supporting that amen but this morning amen once again glorifying god amen that's what we're really here for amen as we continue this journey again together you know just how much longer it will be but we want to be faithful to the lord let again and sins wherein times pass you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also you have had your life or conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great father where when he loved us even when we were dead in sins and quickened us together with christ for by grace our key state it has raised development together and of sin and our conversations love the pleasure so tell you god has foreign been helping me father helping me inside that three four months we have some time open there's a spring yeah try that all right there we go amen there's a spring open that we can drink from amen that'll never run dry and it's always bubbling i mean it's always got freshness to it amen amen that's what we need now we've been speaking about amen um surrendering ourselves surrendering ourselves to the lord amen and uh dying to ourself amen we forfeiting our rights how many believes that amen if you want more of god you're going to have to surrender more about not being halfway not being lukewarm but being a complete christian amen i'll tell you what it really deserves more time on it don't but just uh nobody you know because there's nothing more miserable amen there's nothing no worse state to be than on defense you know a little of this and a little that that just doesn't work well the christian law with god doesn't work right when you're not 100 committed when it's not 100 and it just ends up in misery but on the other hand we talked about what it's like when you are submitted to god when you come to this place but i want to back up and read a quote and i don't know don't know that i ever read this one the other last sunday i guess it was and i meant to because i was talking about completely surrendering ourselves to god and brother bannon he was talking about all the revivals that we've had all the people the hundreds of people that go to the polls perhaps and pray and do these things and so forth and he says look at where it's at now look at where all those folks are and he makes the statement what good did it do it really didn't do any good he was very negative about what good it did because of the fact that those people doing that they were just partial about what they were doing they weren't completely surrendered amen i'll tell you this right now when god himself comes down and a prophet like brother branham says now you know i can't deserve nobody's thoughts i i can't do anything and i'm just here waiting you know who i'm waiting on him the supernatural god himself to come down and then he would come down he'd begin to discern the thoughts and just like he did it with the woman at the well right and so forth and he began to manifest himself and so forth and then to think that people could walk away from that and call it mental telepathy or mind reading it's called and it's actually blasphemy because you call jesus says when the holy ghost comes and does these things you speak one word against that it will never be forgiven you not in this world or the world to come let me say something else that when you know the truth people that have been in this message and know the truth and then when you willfully listen when you willfully disbelieve this message huh brother ma'am said that willfully there remains no more sacrifice sin but abandoned called it blasphemy there is no forgiveness [Applause] if you disbelieve the truth if you've once believed it what a dangerous thing it is to walk away from the message look at all the blood and the crazy part is that these people will still be spiritual i don't understand it but they'll still act like they're spiritual most of the time these people that do this feel like they were above the prophet of god better than him knew more about it than that which is very scary i mean i was miriam one time one time they made fun of moses a little bit he says don't you fear god he says if there's a prophet or somebody else visit him in dreams or visions or whatever but ain't nobody like moses i speak to him lift the ear when he hears me hears your audible voice and i know still i speak to him to lift the ear and they were stricken with leprosy you're both gonna die but god says don't touch my prophets no harm amen you can't do anything of god's anointed but what you receive of reward for amen amen praise the lord and even and i've got a lot of confidence listen so so what good did it do nothing it'll never do any good until every person that professes to be a christian will forget his own ability and yield himself completely to god how many knows if you would be any kind of a christian if god does something you would believe what god does if you're completely yielded to god oh my i have to agree with brother brian there's a lot of things that we don't understand huh there's things we don't understand and they don't have to understand it god don't always ask you to understand everything because when he talked to i was preaching to the congregation there and he says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you and didn't explain it and all of that who can hear this saying we don't understand it they all walked away because they couldn't understand it but look at who was saying it even said jesus to his own disciples will you go away also and they had a little revelation we know that the heart of god we know that to the messiah to whom shall we go there ain't nowhere else to go praise be to god amen and so i believe yields himself to god then god can achieve his purpose by sending not a revival but what he needs to send is a good killing good killing how many knows that the secret to getting closer to god is to die more to yourself if you want more of god you've got to make more room for him i believe that's what we've been doing the last few weeks don't you he says don't send a revive just yet but send a killing as the prophet said we need a day of mourning we need a day when we recognize we're not what we ought to be we need a day where we mourn because we're not what we ought to be i like this this retards the end of brother man of ministry he says and you have to die before you can be born again he needs we need a killing of ourselves this tabernacle needs a killing and me with it think about it the prophet of god had an angel wherever he was whatever he did but he said even he needed a killing of himself we need a killing so that we can be revived i mean he believes if you want revival first you have to come and buy yourself a little bit we need a killing of ourselves so that we can be revived to new life i think we're all in that place we wonder where i've prayed well i've sought god i read my bible but i just don't know why i don't have that fire like i once had huh how many knows we come to those planes we come to those deserts sure we do we come to those mountain tops amen oh my so that we can be removed revive to new life and new hope a new hold a new experience and i want to put it this way also an appreciation for god a new vision it refocuses you it gives you a greater hope because as we go along a lot of times in our lives our christian life our hope of what's over there what the future is for us a lot of time that begins to dim it's not as bright as it used to be amen it's like the spring dries up i believe a church i believe a group of people i believe every christian and i have so much of the holy ghost that you'll have a testimony of what god is doing in his life your life let me just say this i hope somebody else comes to me and says boy god just showed me this god just showed me or god done something for me god healed me or god did whatever it might be because how many knows that when god wherever god is there's always the supernatural we need more of the supernatural happening in our lives and i guarantee it's not something you have to produce it's something that just happens as you get closer to god amen joy begins to build up amen yeah because i'll tell you i believe that i believe that there's joy unspeakable and full of glory what i want to this is where i want to focus on this direction i'm going to go here this morning and that is that new experience that new hope that new life that comes forth out of dying to ourselves out of rededicating ourselves to god again i would hope that god that brother branham if he was you know he would not come to this church and say boy it's as cold as it is outside on the inside it's not like an icicle ain't no amen there ain't no hallelujah he didn't have much for a dead church he'd have much for there's no only man's no hallelujah there's no rejoicing in god because we just by the time we just read where we ought to glorify god he dared to be praised for who he is and for his great testimonies in front of things that he did and for the things that he does [Music] and i'll just tell you where i am this is where i am and this is what i'm preaching while i'm preaching because on me good amen oh my you think you're a pretty good christian well that's good but maybe you have to dig just a little bit deeper take a little deeper see how much dedication you have amen i was sitting once again on my couch by god's grace we got the addition done to where we can sit on that by the couch there and look out the windows and put some birds some seed out there and watch all of those blue jays and cardinals and everything out there amen i told my wife honey i must be old i love bird watching i love just to watch birds you know and i was thinking there and i thought you know modern birds i thought you know god feeds those birds he talked about those birds how that you know he knows the fall of a sparrow and and so forth he said behold the fowls of the air how they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them and i thought well god didn't feed them i fed them and i thought just another second that says yes stupid to use you yes you hit it on your heart to feed him so don't don't give me that it's still god if you don't he'll do some other hello if you don't i guarantee ya there's going to be a big corn spill by the farmer somewhere whenever they're taking that wheat whenever they're taking that coin i guarantee god has his hand on it and he'll cause him to drop here and drop there because i don't know about you but when i drive by those cornfields they say flock of birds out there they're having them a good time what is it that heavenly father feeding them they don't have to worry they don't have those deep freeze like you and i do with a cow or a pig in there and man they just go out there and believe god and god takes care of him oh my and he talks about he takes care of the the grass and everything else he says and wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the heaven shall not he much more clothe you oh ye of little faith and i thought that's right god you told us because you use the bird to get it through us that we actually have very little faith he said when i come back to earth will i even find faith on the earth i got to thinking of how that we really have a lot better than what we deserve you realize we all have it better than what we deserve if we follow in his footsteps remember jesus said we're going to be like him jesus didn't have a place to lay his head he didn't have a home he didn't have a bank account huh look at where he was look at what he preached he says he knows that you have neither of these things when they needed to pay their taxes or whatever and they didn't have it they had to go get some gold out of a fish's mouth oh we got if we don't have the bills paid and if we don't have two thousand three thousand five thousand i don't know maybe fifty thousand dollars like i don't know people go crazy over this stuff but we ought to be worried he says don't worry about those things these are the things that the gentiles work before this is what they worry about can we this is what our government worries about this is what they're trying to make it better for you huh giving you this and giving you that i know everybody wants a better life don't you realize the better we have at the time the further away we get from god even the prophet said we don't have it hard enough we've got it too nice we've got it too soft we're getting so soft until we can't even praise god we can't say hallelujah we can't say glory be to god think about it god is somewhere on the back oh ye of little faith paul he didn't have a coat to hardly wear he had great faith snake bite him him and he just chunks it off and goes on and eats his hamburger huh yeah man fixing that being a ship and the ship is going down folks the captain says we're going down he don't worry about it because an angel says just tell them to just hang in there and if they listen to what you say none will perish he had an angel watching over them folks when you think about it this is where i'm at when you're walking with god and you begin to realize how awesome god really is how amazing he really is that's where we're at i hope everybody's surrendered to god huh or did you lose it between last sunday and this sunday huh well i was closer monday halfway tuesday i lost it again someone was smiling right because you know that's what the devil tries to do i guarantee you take a stand for god before the next service he'll try to have tripped you up you make a pledge you make a dedication it won't be long he'll try to snatch that away from you try to get you further away right away if you possibly can let me tell you something i believe it's by the holy spirit that most of the time it's because we have so much we are so busy that we don't have time for god amen lord help us i don't care i don't know about you but i don't want to have to have it rough to praise god i don't want to have to have a trial that brings me to my knees to praise god been there done that that's enough of that let's praise god in the good times the bad times amen and thank you for everything that you have jesus didn't have what you have i didn't have what you have look at all the things that you got look at how good we have it and you have it that nice because of the grace of almighty god praise be to god it ought to make you happy oh i'm happy i can go over to that gas stove and i can just turn it a little bit up pretty speed of god hello i ain't got to go out and chop wood be a nice way to do it but ain't got to y'all pay your tithe i can pay the tank and give my gas like i need to amen i can rejoice in the lord i can be happy in christ when you're completely surrendered amen and god begins to quicken you and bring you back the life he sets you not in devilish places not in hellish places he sets you in heavenly places in christ jesus not just in church not just here now but like my time says when you're going down the road my goodness but every one of these days he's going to jump out of his truck and just do him a little jig and they're going to say tommy doesn't go crazy that's right but you just can't contain it that's how it ought to be for us this morning we just can't hardly stand it god is so good because he is his love is amazing his grace is amazing oh my don't get me started or do get me started i wanted to speak this morning on god's grace god's love and god's providence god's love grace and provenance ma and this is one of the favorite scriptures that i always use when it comes to god's problems right he says don't worry he says shall he not much more clothe you [Music] praise be to god you don't have to do like paul hey timothy bring my extra coat it's cold bring my coat down here would ya my goodness if i want a coat or two i got to decide which one i want out of the 10 in my closet right all the clothes he cares about whether you're clothes he cares about whether you're fed but that's not your concern that's not something you worry about just be like you're lying worried about it amen i'm worried about his righteousness being right with him isn't that right seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you therefore take no thought for tomorrow [Music] amen jesus said quit thinking about these things so much because i guarantee it just like by the time you get to thinking about him something happens gee all you gotta do is meditate on him didn't the bible say meditate on him once in a while day and night [Applause] i'm still working on that how about you i'm giving more time and more thought to the lord and it's going to be good oh my god oh my because i believe like i want to just say i believe that the prophet god said what he said we ought to be the saddest we ought to be the happiest people on what the face of the earth shouldn't be any room for doom and gloom because he promised oh my i just had to think about motherboard i'm so glad i'm a christian i won't know what i would do if i wasn't a christian if i wasn't saved by the grace of god then i would be just like that sinner like brother brian said i wrote that down he says the only difference between trump and you them and you is god has shed his light on you oh my let's start first with god's love would that be okay how many knows that over saint john it talks about that god is love anybody that says they know him and you ain't got love in your heart now you're a liar he that loveth is of god he that loveth not is not the god it causes you to do stuff that you wouldn't have to do love does that's right he goes out there and produces grace amen it produces grace love produces greats oh my god didn't have to god didn't have to but he did but he did he didn't have to make me but he did in the conception of your mother's womb he could have chose a million other people besides you i'll just stay seated if you possibly can think about it but he chose you he chose you to live thank god i chose you out of all those people amen first of all let me just go all the way back to genesis the bible says and god created the heavens and the earth huh he'd have to but he did he made the mood he made the stars didn't have to but he did [Applause] he made the oceans he made the waters he made the animals he made everything that was made to marvel says without him there was nothing made that was made absolutely nothing he dwelt alone he was by himself and he was sufficient that way he was happy that way [Applause] can i say for a hundred quadrillion billion years he was by himself now that numerology brother brad is probably all messed up huh quadrillion billion trillions higher than billions so it would be quite trillions of years he was there by itself that's right don't go there your mind can't handle trying to figure out way back there no it don't work but he was and i accept that don't you but he had something in his mind he made all the animals he meant everything that was made because of what because of love in his heart because of the love that he had in his heart that's why i did it that's why we're here that's why everything is like it is because of the love of jesus christ that's why you sit there this morning huh you're not out there at home somewhere having went to a saturday night party now you're laying in your bed with a severe headache feeling very depressed and a great big hangover regretting what you did last night praise be to god think about it and he made all the creatures of the earth all the animals and it was good how many can say it was good [Applause] psalms says it was david last the third to last chapter said it this way praise the lord praise you lord from the heavens praise him from the height praise he him all his angels amen praise you him all his hosts how many knows he created angels before he ever created the earth seraphim's cherubims cherubims and all of those to worship him praise him praise him son praise him moon how many beasts he does the son brings him glory the moon he brings his lord it shines his glory what do you get from the sun and the moon folks i'm telling you right now any god that can hang that up there and get it going perfectly around like that he can take care of any problem you got he got and he got it all under control amen we aren't going to get past the love of god i don't think because i should like to get in his grace also and his providence amen sun moon stars ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that be above the heavens let them praise the name of the lord for he commanded and they were how many believe sometimes you just simply got to give god praise for what he made huh whenever you make something great or somebody does something hey that's really beautiful that's awesome what about god where's his praise where is his glory amen praise the lord from the earth you dragons and all deeps fire hell snow [Laughter] next time it snows go out there and grab a pot of snow say praise the lord snow hallelujah glory we know that god made the snow he made you he made your voice he made your heart he made you mind he made you soul what for well i guess it's all right no that's not what he made it for i'll tell you right now that football players and basketball players and movie stars getting more praise than god with people um sometimes but i'm here to tell you not from christians huh not from christians we don't praise all that we praise our god well y'all know the story verb said that he man came into his service and there was a woman that screeched or whatever and hey man hallelujah he got chills chills up his back he's like give me chills he says well if you get to heaven but you're gonna freeze the death with them chills because it's gonna be a shout it's gonna be shouting praise god hallelujah glory to god folks i don't know about you but i can't wait until i've got the proper voice proper voice to express myself to almighty god and when we do when we get the proper sound what's it gonna sound like that's right sister becky it's gonna sound like thunder that's what the revelation says it was at the sound of let's have a little this morning come on glory sounds like thunder them people is praising god because they were down in that lay out of the same age that liked to smothered out their life it liked to made them cold and indifferent and formal the way it didn't mean anything anymore coming to church was the drag you know how many people go to church and it's a drag to them you know how many go to church and they go back home and it was a drag my let the snow the vapor vapor huh stormy wind how many knows fulfilling his word that's right every part of creation it's his love it's his grace mountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedars beasts cattle creeping thing and flying foul huh what are they doing praising the lord thank you lord for feeding me last year thank you lord for that little grain that preacher put out for me ah thank you lord [Applause] every even the birds give him praise and glory beast and cattle and creeping things flying foul kings of the earth and all people princes and all judges of the earth young men maidens men children let them praise the name of the lord for his name alone is excellent his glory is about the heavens and the earth amen he also exalts us the horn of his people and praise all of all his saints even to the children of israel people near unto him praise ye the lord sing to him with a new song amen let them praise the name his name in the dance let them sing praises and with him with the timbrel and the heart for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation amen amen chapter 50 last verse all these other ways he says let everything that has breath praise the lord all his creation praises him but god wasn't satisfied with just the animals and the lions and all of these beautiful things god could have had all this paradise and him and his angels couldn't come and it happened at the earth and enjoyed it but what was it he had something else in mind didn't he the bible says that he created man out of dust of the earth he had something else in mind that was adam and eve he created them male and female amen like we say sorry folks it was not adam and steve no it was not male and male it was male and female you know where we're at this morning we're at the place that they were way back in genesis i have never heard hardly at all of god ever repenting of anything repenting of something god repenting but it says in genesis 6 and 5 god saw the wickedness of man i mean it was after the fall i mean as he wouldn't have he wouldn't had to allow it to fall but he did huh sure he did why so that he could do something even greater than allowing it to fall how many is glad for the other side of the story i'm glad for the other side of the story because you know if falling was bad well it had to be a purpose so that he could pick you up again he had to let you fall in a hole i told my wife on the way to the church here and i was thinking about it i said write this down you know god allowed us to get into a hole that's what the world certainly is it's like a man that has fallen into the hole and he can't get back out he allowed adam and eve to fall into a hole and it was they were never satisfied man was never satisfied how many knows they were never satisfied until the day of pentecost even peter in them wasn't satisfied with jesus right there with him right now jesus denied him and curse and everything he wasn't satisfied he wasn't happy yet he still hadn't gotten what he needed to get not until the holy ghost came back is this is what restored man and picked him back up out of there out of the deep miry clay amen let me finish this here the wickedness of man was so great that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and he grieved him at his heart i believe that's a message that it goes out amen to all of the world this morning and that is that god is once again griefed at his heart sure jesus was so grieved by israel rejecting him remember that he was on up on the mountain and he wept and he said how i would have hovered you as another brood but you would not it hurt him to his car that they rejected him they didn't want him isn't that what the world is today they don't want to glorify god they don't want to teach creation in church or in schools they want to teach evolution amen but a grieved god man had gotten into such a condition that it grieved god that he had even made man let me just read it and he says i will and he grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping thing and the fowls of the air and for it repent of me that i have made them and what did he do he said i will destroy man from off the face of the earth so what would it have been like brothers and sisters if god would have just destroyed everybody he could have made another adam and eve right he could have what if he just said that's enough of that bunch of this that bunch of wickedness that bunch of idolatry just take it all off wipe it off but there was love in his heart right and he spared a righteous man named noah and his family and out of eight people out of the whole world amen eight people think about the restart of humanity because of the love of god because he's seen down through exactly what it would be and he would have children god desired sons and daughters because it's hard to fellowship with a cow or a horse huh or even a servant how many knows you need to be a little closer to him than a servant the bible says he's not ashamed to call them brethren amen closer than just a servant god had children sons and daughters like himself that he wanted to fellowship with amen and we're fellowshipping him with him now how he believes that but what will that fellowship be brother joe did you ever ask yourself when i meet the lord what's my reaction going to be how are you going to act when you see the lord ah think about it he looks you in the eye huh no doubt but we'll fall down prostrate at his feet and we'll say thank you lord jesus thank you jesus for what you've done for me we will thank and praise him because of the relationship that we had and what he delivered us from where he brought us out of how did he pick this up out of the hole right out of the deep miry and he had such love for us god who is rich in mercy right we were sinners in the world but god rich in mercy where with the love that he had for us brought us out pulled us out of there folks i don't know about you but i see grace i see the love of god working in this congregation i see him calling us calling us further and further away from the things of the world to a closer walk i hear god speaking myself that got nothing to do with it it's his spirit that is pulling on us that's drawing on us that wants to be closer to us so that when we do see him face to face we don't have to be ashamed we don't have to repent we don't did we had everything right with him we were there we had our clothes in line we had spotless we were there waiting for him like peter said that you'll be found him not having any blemish spot no wrinkle no nothing but say lord is so good to see you you finally come he'll say it's good to see you come and enjoy the things that's been created for you from the foundation of the world well done good and faithful servant enter into the joy of the lord there's lots of room for you to worship praise up here you praise me down there now come up here and praise me amen live for the eons of time amen aren't you glad listen folks that let me just talk on end with talking about providence for a few minutes god is provided i mean i'm just glad for god's provided way god has provided a way for us in this generation if it would have been for his love that he had for us he'd have never wrote in there about malachi 4. he'd never said i'll send you a light to the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord he never said i'll return your hearts back to the faith of the fathers you're going to believe like paul that people did hello you're going to be restored back to the faith of the fathers and man because if he wouldn't have done that we'd all be laid out of citizens we'd all be sitting here with tattoos all over us we'd be sitting here with nose rings in the earrings and ain't no telling what we'd look like well we wouldn't even be here would we no we'd be out there with the rest and we'd forget about going to church but we'd be in that kind of condition if it wasn't for god's love and his grace for you or not god makes the way i don't care what the situation is he makes a way he cares about us he provides for us his love and his grace provides for us right down to the clothing that you wear paul never worried about what he what he needed he never worried about his next meal he never thought about any of that he just thought about letting god use him to bring the gospel to the gentiles to establish churches here and there and work for the lord i mean that's our top that is our primary let's let god work through our lives and we do our job then we provide for this and then we do all of that right but our primary thing is to seek the kingdom first because his grace and his love will provide for everything you need an example is israel how many knows when israel needed a deliverer god sent them moses and when he got out of out of egypt and so forth god wanted to get it in their minds that i will supply for you i will make a way for you that's why we sing i will make a boy when there just seems to be no way a lot of you are sitting here this morning because this is the way that god provided for you you're sitting in god's provided way huh that's exactly right i know i am i am here because god provided a way for me when i didn't know which direction to go what to do god led me through he leads you through you got to put a smile on your face to know that no matter what the future holds it doesn't matter what the government i don't care to squeeze i don't care what is ahead of us we know the one that is leading us we know the one that makes a way for us because it's his grace and to think that you didn't have to he didn't have to earn your salvation you didn't have to work for it oh yeah he's accept what he did oh my when we think about it it's what god did it's all about what god does but god did it calvary and now we respond to that it's a reaction to an action why will respond to what he already did he created all of these things for his children amen the bible says god has made all things amen i believe brother brian are talking about to have fun with he created all things for us to enjoy that's what the bible says he uses the name enjoy bible god once says here we are saved by grace being led by almighty god going down this route take go to ours happy go entire seven just as happy as we can be with not a care in the world only that we please him that is our main caries lord am i pleasing to you amen i thank god and i begin i i you know i want to go through a lot of it but i don't have time but just to think about just israel look when the first thing he did was bring him down to the red sea right a dead end no way to go with chariots and horses of the whole army coming up and hearing it come because he wanted to see what they would do he wanted to see if they would completely trust him completely submit themselves to him and say well god brought us up he'll make a way if they all sat down better than if they'd all sat down on the rock and says well we've got to worry in the world folks praise be to god can i tell you something i believe those two million people that are in hell today or lost would have been in heaven because the bible says that they believe not and that's why god refused to let them enter into rest jesus said they're everyone dead because no matter how many times i put them in a hard place no matter how many times i kept them from allowing them to get hungry i allowed them to get thirsty because i want them to realize something that i am god and i do to supply i make way how many believes that god makes the way i want to say this again i said it a million times don't take things into your own hands and do and deal with things carnally you committed to god and you watch god work it out and then come back to church and say brother bob i did that and god did it you'll have a testimony because if you can't do that you're still carnal you're still alive and you need dying how many believes god is good i believe that god is a god of justice amen and while it is the greatest time that ever laid for the believer lays ahead the worst time for the unbeliever lays ahead because they refuse to accept what god did for him to give him glory and honor like he was due amen so how many will say god help me in the future that i will never take things into my own hands but i will rely on you and to know that you are my provider because you love me you care about the food i eat you care about the clothes that i are you care about the car that drive you care about the home that you care about all those things and you told me not to worry and think so much about those things how many could think a little bit less about those things and a little bit more of god are you with me we can think a little less about the cares of life and think more about god we'll be a whole lot better off and we'll be closer to god lord help us i think about his grace the whole way he created it all he made it all he makes the way he provides the grace he provides the forgiveness gives you a signed document you're forgiven of all yours what else can he do he did it all because of his love and his grace amen god bless you amen you love the lord stand with me we'll have a word of prayer kind heavenly father once again lord we come to the house of god to praise you we get up of a morning lord to praise you we get dressed we get in our cars many of us drive a long way lord to glorify your name lord jesus and to honor you lord father that's what we assemble ourselves together lord not just brag about us ourselves there's nothing to brag about but when we talk about you lord there is so much to brag about there is so much to praise you about like the song says i've got so much to be thankful so more so much to praise him for lord you've been so good to me lord jesus and we say that from the bottom of our heart we accept your grace lord we thank you for your goodness lord and as we get closer to your lord we are realized and it's all by your love and by your grace lord and it causes us to say praise god hallelujah amen we just thank you all for your mercy and for your grace for you where you brought of us from for getting us out of that deep ditch lord when others are still tattooing drinking beer and everything else that they do trying to get up out of there get rid of that terrible feeling and oh trying to get to feel that emptiness lord still scratching and clawing oh god made the whole world realize that they're saved if they'll just accept it there's mercy there for me if they'll just receive it lord we thank you for the grace that you have shown every heart here this morning we dedicate ourselves a fresh to you and say lord jesus help us to take one thing home with us and that is that we need to think less about our daily cares and more about your word and we'll be better off lord jesus and closer to you lord we ask you in the name of jesus christ and lord now as we're about to open the scriptures to go into a communion service we're thankful our jesus to do this for you father for you have asked us to do this lord jesus as often as we meet lord jesus in remembrance of you lord and father when we think about you and what you did lord jesus we barely can't contain ourselves because of how awesome and great you are knowing god that you have given these things to us freely if we'll just receive it we ask god that you bless community service now and each one that partakes of it lord jesus father if there's anybody that can't take it for some reason we ask god that be right that be next month they wouldn't be like that but they'd be in a place where they can take the lord's suffering communion for you said if you don't take this you have no part with me lord we ask god did you forgive all sins and failures lord jesus name amen and
