[39:50] this morning and we'll go to
[39:52] the book of matthew
[40:02] and i think we'll go with
[40:08] let me see here which one do i want
[40:11] 13 matthew 13 first
[40:15] i have several different scriptures that
[40:17] i want to
[40:18] read
[40:23] but in matthew 13
[40:26] and we'll begin with verse 18.
[40:31] hear ye therefore the parable of the
[40:33] sower
[40:35] when anyone heareth the word of the
[40:37] kingdom and understandeth it not
[40:40] then cometh the wicked one and catches
[40:42] away that which was sown
[40:44] in his heart this is he which receiveth
[40:48] seed
[40:49] by the wayside but he that receiveth the
[40:52] seed in stony places the same is he
[40:55] that heareth the word an anon with joy
[40:57] receiveth it
[40:59] yet hath not root in himself but dureth
[41:02] for a while
[41:03] for when tribulation and persecution
[41:06] arises because of the word by and by he
[41:08] is offended
[41:10] he also that received seed among the
[41:13] thorns
[41:13] is he that heareth the word and the care
[41:16] of this world
[41:18] and the deceitfulness of riches choke
[41:21] the word and he becometh unfruitful
[41:24] but he that receiveth seed unto the good
[41:26] ground is he that heareth the word
[41:29] and understandeth it which also beareth
[41:32] fruit
[41:32] and bringeth forth some 100 fold some
[41:36] 60 and some 30. may god had his
[41:39] blessings to the reading of the words
[41:41] you can be seated
[41:42] this morning amen i want to
[41:46] speak on really kind of two different
[41:49] subjects but one will tie
[41:51] into the other one i want to talk about
[41:54] identification
[41:55] and god's mirrors amen
[41:58] god's mirrors amen so that's what we
[42:02] want to speak on this morning with the
[42:03] help of the lord
[42:05] amen
[42:07] [Applause]
[42:09] i want to start with a story that we're
[42:12] all familiar with but i want to read it
[42:13] just
[42:14] to lay a foundation i don't know i'm
[42:16] sure everybody's probably heard this
[42:18] maybe not everybody out there but
[42:20] other bands as a little boy one time
[42:22] down here in kentucky
[42:23] raised up in the mountains and he'd
[42:25] never been around
[42:27] where there was a looking glass and he
[42:29] had a little piece
[42:30] tacked up on a tree but he'd never seen
[42:32] himself
[42:33] so here he come to louisville it was
[42:36] told to stay with his
[42:37] mother's sister and he lived in one of
[42:40] the nice homes
[42:42] old-fashioned home and when they in
[42:45] went into one of the bedrooms it had a
[42:48] door
[42:48] that had a mirror all the way up and
[42:51] down the door
[42:52] and when a little fellow started to run
[42:54] through the house he stopped
[42:56] now little johnny little johnny and then
[42:59] he scratched his head and little johnny
[43:01] in the mirror scratched his head
[43:02] he laughed and little john in the mirror
[43:05] laughed he jumped up and down a little
[43:07] johnny jumped up down in the mirror
[43:09] see he walked up real close and he
[43:11] thought it was a little boy he could
[43:13] play with
[43:14] so he walked up directly and he pecked
[43:16] on the glass
[43:17] he turned around and his parents was
[43:19] watching him he said mama
[43:21] that's me amen
[43:24] but the baby says now you look in this
[43:26] one amen and he's talking about the
[43:28] bible how many believes that this bible
[43:29] is god's mirror
[43:31] this is god's mirror amen and every time
[43:34] that we come to church every time you
[43:36] open this bible every time you get into
[43:38] the word of god
[43:40] you look into god's mirror
[43:44] amen and you know
[43:48] it's kind of different but that mirror
[43:51] and our age especially i believe that
[43:54] this mirror
[43:55] you know it maybe got a little muddy
[43:57] over the dark ages and people really
[43:59] didn't
[43:59] understand justification and
[44:01] sanctification and the new birth
[44:03] and what the holy ghost really was and
[44:05] all these things but i believe god has
[44:06] cleared it up don't you believe
[44:08] that he cleared it up tied up all the
[44:10] loose ends and got everything back
[44:12] together to where
[44:13] when you look in this mirror when you
[44:15] read the bible
[44:16] you can actually identify yourself amen
[44:20] it shows you who you are and so prophet
[44:22] makes its statement like this
[44:24] you look in this one he says which is
[44:27] you
[44:28] which one of these little johnnies are
[44:30] you impersonating
[44:31] which one is you see you're one of them
[44:35] that's one of them
[44:37] he's you would turn back he says the
[44:39] first little flaw and so forth but
[44:41] that's a different thought
[44:42] he says test it with the word and see if
[44:44] it's right
[44:45] now look in the mirror of god's word if
[44:48] he was to look in the mirror of god's
[44:49] word in
[44:50] other ages to see what group of these
[44:53] three that you'd be identified with
[44:55] this is another quote out of three kinds
[44:57] of believers but ibrahim says there's
[44:59] only three kinds of believers
[45:00] in the world only three kind of people
[45:04] in the world there's a make-believer a
[45:06] believer
[45:07] and an unbeliever isn't that right amen
[45:10] so there's only three kinds no matter
[45:12] what race no matter what it is
[45:14] amen you're either unbeliever or you're
[45:16] a hypocrite
[45:18] or a real genuine believer now i just
[45:21] want to start with saying this that
[45:23] uh it's very important amen it's very
[45:26] important because
[45:28] i'm here to tell you that you got to be
[45:30] very careful because
[45:31] you know it's as hard to look in this
[45:34] mirror sometimes
[45:35] and to identify your own fault as it is
[45:38] for you
[45:38] to be able to see your own fault how
[45:40] many knows we're we're
[45:42] geniuses at not being able to see our
[45:44] own faults
[45:46] now right amen and i believe it takes
[45:49] god's light of god's word and the holy
[45:51] spirit
[45:52] for people to actually be able to see
[45:54] their fault to be able to
[45:56] see what they really look like
[46:00] who they really are
[46:05] let me stop this and also and we know
[46:07] that
[46:08] people don't really learn from history
[46:11] uh you know john michael uh brother john
[46:15] you know john had to learn his lessons i
[46:18] had to learn my lessons
[46:20] we all had to learn our lessons didn't
[46:22] we
[46:24] you know it doesn't matter how much our
[46:25] parents knew what experience they had
[46:28] we also had to go through the same
[46:31] troubles we also had to go through
[46:33] uh trials and tests and experience the
[46:36] same things they had to trust that you
[46:38] know god don't have no grandchildren
[46:40] every son that comes to god must be
[46:43] tried everything must be tested
[46:46] and and and the next generation you have
[46:48] grandkids
[46:49] guess what they have to learn the same
[46:51] thing
[46:53] they'll have to find out who they are
[46:57] it's very very important and i believe
[47:00] uh you know i may say this that i
[47:02] believe that between the ages of 14
[47:05] and 20 21 it's who you're gonna find who
[47:08] you really are
[47:11] i bear record of this because if you
[47:13] remember brother branham said that most
[47:14] people that actually get born again and
[47:16] serve god
[47:17] do it in that time frame and that right
[47:20] that's what he taught us most of them do
[47:22] it in that time frame
[47:23] and then people get begin to tend to sit
[47:25] into whatever they're going to be
[47:26] through their 20s 30s 40s and 50s
[47:29] don't mean that they can't get saved any
[47:31] time during that and that nobody does
[47:33] that doesn't name that at all
[47:35] but most generally that's the time that
[47:38] people get set in their ways
[47:40] that's most generally when they decide
[47:42] which route they're going to go because
[47:44] those are the time that you have to make
[47:46] a choice on which direction you're going
[47:48] to go
[47:49] what you're going to become whether it's
[47:51] a christian whether it's a
[47:53] just a pretty good person or whether
[47:54] it's a criminal or whether it's
[47:56] whatever it is amen
[47:59] and each age each age has to every
[48:02] young person you have to decide who you
[48:06] are
[48:08] what you're going to be amen that right
[48:11] because for me it was that i think about
[48:14] 20 19 20 years old
[48:16] is when the lord had mercy on me isn't
[48:19] that right
[48:20] and i said i believe that i'm the son of
[48:22] god
[48:24] i want to be god's child and that's
[48:27] something there was some calling
[48:28] in there and god saved me at the age of
[48:30] about 20 or something like that
[48:32] and 21 i got married i believe it was i
[48:34] think it was 21.
[48:36] and so you know and ever since that
[48:39] experience with almighty god i realized
[48:41] who i was and what i wanted to be and
[48:44] amen and i looked in the mirror of god's
[48:46] word and amen and whatever that word
[48:48] said i wanted to follow it 100
[48:51] i wanted to find my identification
[48:54] in the word of god i found my
[48:57] identification
[48:58] in this right here but remember
[49:02] this here this is let me just say
[49:04] something else that when we come to
[49:06] church
[49:07] and we look in the mirror sometimes we
[49:10] don't like what we see
[49:12] now there's a big difference between
[49:14] people playing tapes and having a
[49:16] minister
[49:17] right ministering the word because you
[49:19] can play whatever tape you want
[49:22] amen and you can pretty much put out
[49:25] and let me tell you something we as
[49:27] human beings every one of us
[49:29] is uh very prone to sit there
[49:33] and have pitchfork religion we can amen
[49:36] when we know something's being said
[49:37] about somebody else
[49:39] but we're totally silent and don't even
[49:41] acknowledge it when it shouldn't be
[49:43] when it when it's actually coming to you
[49:46] people have a absolute a barricade i
[49:50] mean i'm one of these big old stone
[49:52] block
[49:52] barricades they have to take a lift to
[49:54] set on amen when it comes to allowing
[49:56] the word coming in
[49:57] and showing them where they're on where
[50:00] their fault is
[50:02] because i guarantee all of us will be at
[50:04] the altar more if the holy spirit shows
[50:06] you where you're wrong
[50:07] at because remember this one thing the
[50:09] prophet of god said amen that if we come
[50:11] to church
[50:12] for any other reason then to find out
[50:14] where our bad
[50:16] places are then we've come for the wrong
[50:18] purpose
[50:19] we come to look in the mirror of god's
[50:22] word and find
[50:23] out where our bad places are not the
[50:26] neighbors bad places
[50:28] but the devil that's what the devil does
[50:29] to us oh brothers also needed that since
[50:31] the souls don't need that
[50:33] we're good at that amen instead of
[50:35] listening now how can i apply what the
[50:37] preacher is saying to my life
[50:40] amen and and after a while i want to
[50:43] show you
[50:44] that's god's mirror amen we ultimate the
[50:47] ministers and
[50:48] christians ultimately are god's mirror
[50:51] amen and sometimes the reflection is so
[50:53] bright
[50:54] amen the holy spirit and god through his
[50:56] word
[50:57] reflects that so much until the audience
[51:00] and the congregation
[51:02] get so mad that they bashed
[51:06] people's heads in brother bile are you
[51:09] going a little extreme no i'll show you
[51:10] in scripture where it happened
[51:12] people don't like what they see people
[51:15] don't like what they hear
[51:17] huh even jesus says you know i have come
[51:22] and i have showed you the light has
[51:23] shown you
[51:24] the right way he says now your sin is
[51:26] open before you
[51:27] now you have no more excuse when the
[51:29] true light comes and it shines
[51:31] and you say you see you realize it's the
[51:32] truth then you can't hide anymore
[51:36] amen is that okay
[51:40] when i think about this i'm thinking
[51:41] about that this is my job
[51:43] you know right i said lord help us
[51:47] not a job that's coveted we have to be
[51:49] ordained to it
[51:51] is that right but it has to be and god's
[51:52] servants do it each and every one of you
[51:55] have a job
[51:56] and that is to be a reflector of god's
[51:59] word
[52:00] in your neighborhood
[52:04] amen but you know when i got to thinking
[52:07] about this i think i thought about what
[52:09] brother branham said about the symphony
[52:11] and how it has a certain two and there's
[52:13] different players i mean those
[52:14] and really that this whole creation it's
[52:16] been god's symphony
[52:18] and the god has had a music sheet the
[52:20] man that that means something to people
[52:22] that are listening
[52:24] and there's different players playing
[52:26] different parts
[52:27] right like peter and the wolf and i mean
[52:30] one person might
[52:31] change clothes many times become many
[52:33] other things and he said that's the way
[52:34] it was with god god
[52:35] changed where he dwells in whether it
[52:38] was a pillar fire in the old testament
[52:39] or jesus in the new
[52:41] or or his people here in the last days
[52:44] he changed his masses so forth but each
[52:47] one has a part part to play
[52:49] and how many believes each and every one
[52:51] of us play a part
[52:53] we play a part some part amen amen we're
[52:56] going to play the part of a believer or
[52:58] we're going to make play a part of a
[52:59] make-believer
[53:00] or the part of an unbeliever now let me
[53:02] just say this that i believe that
[53:04] in the day of judgment someday people
[53:06] sins
[53:07] and some someday people are really going
[53:09] to be shown the mirror
[53:12] okay on the day of judgment god is going
[53:14] to show everybody there's not going to
[53:16] be one thing that was ever dark
[53:18] done in dark or even a thought that you
[53:20] ever had that won't be brought to the
[53:21] forefront
[53:22] and god will show you what you really
[53:24] was no matter how much you tried to
[53:26] deceive yourself
[53:27] because the multitude of people i
[53:29] believe it's only
[53:31] the bible talks about the whole world is
[53:33] deceived by the antichrist
[53:36] people don't really ever and especially
[53:38] make believers and unbelievers or
[53:39] especially make believers amen there's
[53:41] so many people
[53:43] amen that'll be on that day thinking
[53:45] that they were right but they were wrong
[53:47] now right and on that day it'll be shown
[53:50] where they were wrong at
[53:52] but i believe the true believer
[53:56] catches it now right because as we come
[53:59] to church and when we come to church
[54:01] what are you listening out there when
[54:02] you hear the word of god when you come
[54:04] to church
[54:05] and you hear the word of god
[54:08] going forth it's actually
[54:11] judgment going forth peter says you know
[54:14] the judgment must begin at the house of
[54:17] god
[54:18] our bad places that we see come out here
[54:23] is that right this is where it comes out
[54:25] at this is where
[54:26] you have to have an open heart say well
[54:28] is this the way that i am
[54:30] you know is this how does this apply to
[54:33] me
[54:34] amid it say and then say god oh my and
[54:38] there you are
[54:39] your sin is exposed and the bad that you
[54:41] are is exposed and you either have to
[54:44] get mad about it you have to say no i
[54:46] refuse to believe it it ain't me
[54:50] block it out of your mind in that right
[54:52] or you can say that's exactly
[54:55] you know let's just take one little
[54:57] illustration i believe it was last
[54:58] part in the last week or two i talked
[55:00] about you know if you got a temper we
[55:01] all got a temper probably if we push too
[55:04] hard
[55:06] amen we probably all do you might not
[55:08] think you do but just wait a little bit
[55:10] find out you know and and i
[55:14] i want to tend to believe i hardly do
[55:15] but hey sometimes i still do i say oh
[55:17] boy you know
[55:19] but you know just to acknowledge but hey
[55:21] you know i lost my temper with my wife
[55:23] my husband i lost my temper
[55:25] and i ain't no way that i can get the
[55:27] holy ghost unless i make that rhyme
[55:30] because like it takes a little flight
[55:32] right there you know amen and if you're
[55:33] not willing to acknowledge that you're
[55:35] gonna you're gonna live in deception
[55:37] your whole time
[55:39] but that light comes out and then you
[55:41] say god i don't want to be that way
[55:43] take it away now the good thing about
[55:47] judgment in the house of god you're
[55:49] seeing being judged
[55:50] here is that it goes on up beforehand
[55:54] and guess what's up there up there right
[55:56] now there is a tub of bleach
[55:58] and it goes through that blood and it
[56:01] goes into the sea of god's forgetfulness
[56:04] that's why we come to church for us to
[56:06] look in the mirror of god's word to let
[56:08] our sins to go
[56:09] up to get purified to get cleansed of
[56:11] forgiveness
[56:12] because the white throne judgment it
[56:13] doesn't have any mercy this is the only
[56:16] place that judgment
[56:17] is that there's mercy
[56:20] there's grace there's forgiveness some
[56:23] men sins go beforehand unto judgment
[56:25] others follow after the bible says
[56:29] amen but i think you can understand
[56:33] now i want to read the scripture for it
[56:35] so here we find that
[56:37] jesus begin to uh in a parable
[56:41] tell us of the different kinds of there
[56:44] is isn't that right
[56:45] something that you know they get you
[56:47] hear the word
[56:48] but they don't understand it now what
[56:51] good does the word do
[56:52] if you don't understand it hello
[56:56] when do go on after
[57:04] i said if you don't understand what i'm
[57:06] saying what good does it do nick
[57:08] absolutely nothing it doesn't doesn't be
[57:11] any good
[57:12] if you don't understand it that's the
[57:15] way the word is you might think you
[57:16] understand but if it doesn't really sink
[57:18] down into here
[57:20] it's gone when you go out the horse it
[57:23] didn't do anything for you that's what
[57:26] jesus says the devil quickly just takes
[57:28] it away it's gone
[57:29] but others it sinks down a little bit
[57:31] isn't that right
[57:33] it sinks down and they begin to oh wow
[57:35] yeah hallelujah and it talks about my
[57:37] day
[57:38] rejoice for a while but guess what by
[57:40] and by persecution hardship comes with
[57:42] it
[57:42] god just don't leave you in a bed of
[57:44] ease all your life
[57:46] now he lets the heart think coming to
[57:48] tests come
[57:49] the trials come and all of a sudden you
[57:52] know i'm just not willing to do all this
[57:55] life was better when i was a sinner
[57:58] life was better the other way huh
[58:03] or there's the other class where
[58:06] they know that it's the truth but
[58:08] they're
[58:10] because of the persecution that comes
[58:13] like remember the family the mom and dad
[58:17] of the young man whose eyes were blind
[58:19] isn't that right and jesus opened his
[58:21] blind eyes and the pharisees came to him
[58:23] and
[58:24] if you confess jesus christ you would be
[58:26] put out of the synagogue
[58:28] you would be put out of church and they
[58:31] knew that
[58:32] it was right but yet they wouldn't
[58:34] confess it because
[58:35] and what would he say he was 18. can you
[58:38] imagine say
[58:39] well my son's 18 he's of age ask him
[58:43] i don't want to get in trouble about
[58:44] this people don't want to actually
[58:46] suffer from the gospel
[58:47] they don't want to actually suffer a
[58:48] reproach they don't want to be put out
[58:50] of the church
[58:50] people don't want to quit their church
[58:52] when they know it ain't right
[58:54] for some odd reason or other the prophet
[58:56] of god call it jellyfish people without
[58:58] spying
[58:59] and they're right without backbone and
[59:02] they just want to go along and that's
[59:03] what the parents did
[59:04] i don't know about you but i'm just
[59:06] little i think i tend to believe
[59:07] that i'm a little bit more like peter
[59:11] huh i go a little bit too far sometimes
[59:14] but if my son was blind all his life and
[59:17] get somebody amen prayed for him and he
[59:19] got his
[59:20] his sight back i'd be saying i'll tell
[59:23] you exactly who did
[59:24] it all right wouldn't we all be that way
[59:27] i'd tell you who it is it was jesus of
[59:29] nazareth that's one
[59:31] well we don't know from where he is he's
[59:33] not a goddess out of the other
[59:35] we know what he's isn't that what the
[59:37] young man said to them
[59:39] they asked him who and how he opened his
[59:41] eyes he said jesus of nathan
[59:42] they said they don't know who he is and
[59:43] so forth and the young man reproved them
[59:48] he says wait a minute you're the
[59:49] religious people you are the priest you
[59:51] there ain't nobody higher than you
[59:54] you are the religious people today and
[59:55] here come from what it comes
[59:57] does something ain't never been done and
[59:59] and you don't know from where he is
[1:00:04] they got mad because they didn't like
[1:00:06] their fault shown building
[1:00:10] they didn't like their fault shown and
[1:00:12] so guess what they put him out of the
[1:00:14] synagogue and he says oh
[1:00:15] you're all together a sinner and so
[1:00:17] forth he's holy and righteous pharisees
[1:00:20] you know
[1:00:22] huh but think about the parents there
[1:00:24] that could not
[1:00:25] put up with the reproach and the
[1:00:26] persecution of of
[1:00:28] standing up for the word and that's the
[1:00:29] way it is with the message of the hour
[1:00:31] let me tell you something i believe that
[1:00:32] message of the hour is of god
[1:00:35] amen i'm not ashamed we're not ashamed
[1:00:39] there's people that are they cannot pull
[1:00:41] back let me go on so now i notice
[1:00:45] i like this but you got to identify if
[1:00:47] you lived in an
[1:00:48] other age you've got to be identified
[1:00:51] with a certain group of people
[1:00:53] you're in a certain class you're a
[1:00:56] certain kind of person
[1:00:58] that's right amen whether it was
[1:01:01] way back in the days of noah whether it
[1:01:03] was in jesus time
[1:01:05] brother ben makes this statement he says
[1:01:07] look you're in one of these classes
[1:01:09] and your present state right now this
[1:01:12] present state of mind that you are here
[1:01:15] in this visible audience
[1:01:17] and you that will be in the invisible
[1:01:19] audience on this tape your present state
[1:01:21] of mind
[1:01:22] after listening to this tape proves to
[1:01:24] you
[1:01:25] what class that you're in did he tell
[1:01:28] you
[1:01:29] exactly where you are
[1:01:34] amen whether you're a believer in the
[1:01:37] word and will stay with it
[1:01:39] or whether you would walk out or shut
[1:01:42] the tape off
[1:01:42] see that tells you what they've done
[1:01:45] there
[1:01:47] how many knows it's easy when the
[1:01:48] preacher is preaching hallelujah praise
[1:01:50] god we're all
[1:01:51] it but when he begins to step on your
[1:01:53] toes
[1:01:54] when the truth begins to be told
[1:01:59] then how do you react then that's the
[1:02:01] question that's where it really comes
[1:02:02] down to
[1:02:03] where the rub really comes down to amen
[1:02:07] amen and the lord has a way of showing
[1:02:10] us
[1:02:11] sometimes things that we really don't
[1:02:14] like to see
[1:02:17] amen but we must see him amen
[1:02:20] i'm going to start with john the baptist
[1:02:23] now first of all let me say this we know
[1:02:26] that
[1:02:27] christ is in his body now and we're a
[1:02:30] representation of the moon
[1:02:32] how many knows we represent the church
[1:02:34] represents the moon
[1:02:36] the stars of course is god's servants
[1:02:39] and so forth
[1:02:40] amen his messengers and so forth but the
[1:02:42] moon represents the church
[1:02:45] amen and the moon actually has
[1:02:48] how much light of its own
[1:02:51] absolutely no light of its own why it is
[1:02:55] only reflects
[1:02:56] the sun on the other side of the earth
[1:02:59] amen and is so bright but on a
[1:03:02] full moon when you've got snow on the
[1:03:03] ground you don't even need a flashlight
[1:03:06] you can walk around because i've been
[1:03:07] young and i've been taking many sled
[1:03:09] rides
[1:03:10] in the dark on the full moon and they
[1:03:12] met and
[1:03:13] quite because you brought that much
[1:03:15] light down
[1:03:16] and we're a reflection we're a type of
[1:03:18] that moon
[1:03:19] amen and we're also a type that we are
[1:03:21] reflectors
[1:03:23] we are god's mirrors hello
[1:03:26] this is god's mirror but we're also
[1:03:28] mirrors and god takes his word
[1:03:30] and he brings it down into our hearts
[1:03:33] and then it goes out that direction
[1:03:36] amen all right
[1:03:40] so john the baptist he was a reflector
[1:03:43] of god's word
[1:03:45] amen and in matthew the third chapter
[1:03:48] we'll just look at it
[1:03:50] matthew 3. i want to talk about john the
[1:03:52] baptist we will talk about jesus
[1:03:54] paul for just a little bit and then also
[1:03:56] brother stephen we want to talk about
[1:03:58] stephen for just a minute
[1:04:00] that were reflectors of the light amen
[1:04:02] that showed
[1:04:04] amid people what they really looked like
[1:04:08] right because i'll tell you this right
[1:04:11] now i truly believe that
[1:04:12] the bride of jesus christ at this time
[1:04:16] listen to me everybody i believe that
[1:04:18] the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:20] is taking a real hard
[1:04:24] look at herself i believe she is being
[1:04:28] diligent that you may be found of him
[1:04:31] without spot blameless
[1:04:35] is that right we don't want no spot we
[1:04:38] don't want none of ourself
[1:04:41] now i'm going to say something as a
[1:04:42] pastor sometimes i try to preach i
[1:04:44] preach so hard
[1:04:45] let's make sure that we absolutely want
[1:04:47] to in our hearts
[1:04:48] only do what god tells us to do only
[1:04:52] what this scripture tells us to do
[1:04:54] and yet people will get slack you preach
[1:04:56] that it's like it doesn't take an effect
[1:04:58] at all
[1:05:00] people go the opposite direction rather
[1:05:02] than saying god what is your perfect
[1:05:04] will that's what i want to do
[1:05:05] they do things that's just the other
[1:05:07] direction huh
[1:05:10] it's like water off a duck's back
[1:05:13] amen but i know there's believers i know
[1:05:15] there's children of god
[1:05:17] that he goes down and he brings forth 30
[1:05:20] fold or 60 fold or a hundredfold
[1:05:24] i don't know about you but i want to be
[1:05:25] one of those class don't you i don't
[1:05:27] want to be those that
[1:05:28] fall by the wayside because of
[1:05:29] persecution and just that or the other
[1:05:32] now notice john the baptist in those
[1:05:35] days john the baptist was preaching in
[1:05:37] the wilderness verse 1 of chapter 3
[1:05:39] and saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[1:05:41] heaven is at hand
[1:05:42] for this is that which is spoken of by
[1:05:44] the prophet isaiah is saying
[1:05:46] the voice of one crying in the
[1:05:48] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:05:49] lord
[1:05:50] make straight his paths and the same
[1:05:53] john
[1:05:53] had his raiment of camel's hair and a
[1:05:56] leather and girdled about his loins and
[1:05:58] his meat was locust and wild honey
[1:06:02] he and then went out to him jerusalem
[1:06:05] and all judea and all the regions round
[1:06:08] about
[1:06:09] jordan and were baptized of him in
[1:06:11] jordan
[1:06:12] confessing their sins but
[1:06:15] when he saw many of the pharisees and
[1:06:17] sadducees come
[1:06:19] to his baptism baptism he said unto them
[1:06:23] generation of vipers
[1:06:26] who hath warned you to flee the wrath
[1:06:29] that is to come
[1:06:33] huh can you imagine what a reflection
[1:06:38] he looked at those scribes those
[1:06:39] pharisees how many know she knew the
[1:06:41] attitude they had
[1:06:43] he knew what they were all about he
[1:06:45] called them a bunch of snakes look in
[1:06:47] this word
[1:06:48] i'm here to tell you that you're a snake
[1:06:50] in the grass
[1:06:55] huh i imagine they didn't like the
[1:06:56] mirror too much do you
[1:06:58] didn't like that too much oh my
[1:07:02] but he says bring forth fruit meat for
[1:07:04] repentance
[1:07:05] and don't think to say within ourselves
[1:07:07] with your
[1:07:08] enlarged garments and broad and so forth
[1:07:12] outwardly look righteous and all this
[1:07:14] other and say oh we're
[1:07:15] abraham's seed where abraham don't be
[1:07:17] starting to say that stuff
[1:07:20] we have abraham to our father for i say
[1:07:22] unto you that god is able of these
[1:07:24] stones to raise
[1:07:26] children unto abraham and now the ax is
[1:07:29] laid to the root of the trees
[1:07:32] whoa therefore every tree which bringeth
[1:07:34] forth
[1:07:35] good fruit is hewn down and cast that
[1:07:38] brings not forth good fruit
[1:07:39] it's hewned down and cast into the fire
[1:07:44] amen so he was rough on him
[1:07:47] he told them just what what was going on
[1:07:50] and what they really were that they were
[1:07:51] actually snakes in the grass
[1:07:54] vipers amen
[1:07:58] now let's go over and talk with look at
[1:08:00] what jesus said look at jesus
[1:08:01] he come into contact with the pharisees
[1:08:04] also
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:17] i believe it was uh let's go to
[1:08:20] by the wayside matthew 21 matthew 21
[1:08:33] hold on
[1:08:38] 31-32
[1:08:41] you see if i have that right
[1:08:46] yeah here's the first one and the second
[1:08:48] one will be matthew 23.
[1:08:50] all right so here jesus is preaching
[1:08:55] and uh he asks him a question
[1:08:59] verse 27. he says indeed
[1:09:05] 27 actually 25
[1:09:09] he was asking the baptism of john
[1:09:12] whence was it from heaven or of men
[1:09:15] and they reason with themselves saying
[1:09:18] if we save from heaven
[1:09:20] he will send us why did he not then
[1:09:22] believe him
[1:09:24] but if we shall say of men we fear the
[1:09:26] people for all hold john as
[1:09:29] a prophet and they answered jesus and
[1:09:31] said
[1:09:32] we cannot tell and he said unto them
[1:09:35] neither i thee by what authority i duty
[1:09:39] thinks
[1:09:40] but what think he a certain man had two
[1:09:42] sons
[1:09:43] and think about jesus was so wise that
[1:09:46] even though
[1:09:47] he wasn't going to tell him that he was
[1:09:48] still going to get the point across
[1:09:50] a certain man had two sons and he came
[1:09:52] to the first
[1:09:53] and said son go work today in my
[1:09:57] vineyard he said
[1:09:58] and he answered and said i will not but
[1:10:00] afterwards he repented and went
[1:10:02] and he came to the second and said
[1:10:04] likewise
[1:10:05] and he answered and said i go sir
[1:10:09] and he went not whether of them twain
[1:10:12] did the will of his father and they say
[1:10:14] i am the first and jesus says
[1:10:16] unto them he says verily i say unto you
[1:10:20] that publicans and harlots
[1:10:23] go into the kingdom of god before you
[1:10:28] for john came unto you in the way of the
[1:10:31] wilderness and you believed him not
[1:10:33] but the publicans and the harlots
[1:10:35] believed him and ye
[1:10:37] when he had seen it repented not
[1:10:39] afterwards
[1:10:40] that ye might believe him amen
[1:10:44] look at the rebuke that jesus gave to
[1:10:46] those pharisees he says
[1:10:48] look amen to heartless and prostitute
[1:10:51] they're going to the kingdom of god
[1:10:53] before you do didn't brother bam say he
[1:10:56] says you know i had more cooperation
[1:10:58] with the witch doctors
[1:11:00] and everybody over in america african
[1:11:02] than these bunch of preachers over here
[1:11:04] in america
[1:11:06] he had better cooperation he says you
[1:11:09] know
[1:11:09] uneducated heath and there's a lot
[1:11:11] easier to deal with
[1:11:12] than that educated one amen and an
[1:11:16] educated one heathen is somebody that
[1:11:17] won't believe god even though they claim
[1:11:19] to be a christian
[1:11:21] amen how many know this generation got a
[1:11:24] true
[1:11:25] look at what they were really like
[1:11:30] folks when the prophet came out in the
[1:11:32] seals and he really tell
[1:11:33] told us what denomination or what
[1:11:36] churches were really all about
[1:11:37] amen and how that how horrible it really
[1:11:40] was
[1:11:42] what did they do they put him out they
[1:11:45] wouldn't have the prophet back anymore
[1:11:47] they wouldn't have none of that
[1:11:48] discernment going on
[1:11:49] anymore i believe that's part of the
[1:11:52] reason there and identification brother
[1:11:54] brown there thompson
[1:11:55] talked about how that you know that it
[1:11:57] was like there's so many in the holidays
[1:11:59] they had to go
[1:12:00] so far with him like those seventy they
[1:12:02] went so far with him but then he said
[1:12:05] something that they just couldn't stop
[1:12:07] me it was contrary to their teaching
[1:12:09] he says unless you eat my flesh and
[1:12:11] drink my blood you have no part with me
[1:12:14] is that right and they just couldn't
[1:12:16] take and those seven days he says who
[1:12:18] can hear this
[1:12:19] and the seventy left amen they left he
[1:12:22] wouldn't
[1:12:23] walk with him no more and then even
[1:12:25] jesus said to his own disciples
[1:12:27] will you also go away
[1:12:31] amen folks i want to be in that class
[1:12:35] right there where you say to whom shall
[1:12:38] we go
[1:12:40] where are you going to go
[1:12:43] thou alone has the worst of eternal life
[1:12:47] see even nicodemus knew nicodemus knew
[1:12:51] isn't that right he came to jesus by
[1:12:53] night he says we know
[1:12:55] that no man can do these things unless
[1:12:58] god is with him
[1:12:59] you can't raise the dead healed to
[1:13:01] sicken that forth so forth
[1:13:02] unless god is with him we know that
[1:13:06] but you know because of my popularity i
[1:13:08] had to come in the dark
[1:13:10] i had to wear my hoodie my dark glasses
[1:13:13] you know and
[1:13:14] hide and not be seen coming to see jesus
[1:13:17] or i might get put out
[1:13:19] see ashamed of the real truth
[1:13:22] amen so now notice here's one of them
[1:13:26] but let's look again
[1:13:28] the scribes in the pharisees and i'm
[1:13:30] going to say this again
[1:13:31] the sad part is that people that don't
[1:13:34] take a real good look at themselves are
[1:13:36] going to be deceived
[1:13:38] amen and there's going to be the
[1:13:39] majority of the world is that way
[1:13:42] they don't take a good look at their
[1:13:44] self
[1:13:46] see where they really are
[1:13:52] amen because i'm here to tell you take a
[1:13:55] good look at yourself
[1:13:57] take a real good look at yourself
[1:14:00] amen and i'll tell you this right now
[1:14:03] every time that you said something that
[1:14:05] was
[1:14:06] not quite right huh
[1:14:09] just like brother branham when he went
[1:14:11] outside of there and he says you know
[1:14:13] tell him i'm not here
[1:14:14] he went outside the door and tell him
[1:14:16] i'm not here by the time his wife said
[1:14:18] he's not here he was probably out inside
[1:14:23] but the holy spirit wouldn't let him
[1:14:24] live with that woody no
[1:14:26] he couldn't even pray for somebody why
[1:14:27] those little things it showed him hey
[1:14:29] you know that ain't right
[1:14:31] you know and when we all you know you
[1:14:34] all
[1:14:35] each and every one of you we look at
[1:14:36] ourselves you might find more of that
[1:14:38] than what you really realize
[1:14:41] you'll see your faults but if you don't
[1:14:43] man if you deceive yourself
[1:14:46] it's never your fault it's always
[1:14:47] somebody else's fault
[1:14:49] it's always some other reason some other
[1:14:52] cause no
[1:14:54] god said you know god's not gonna it's
[1:14:56] not gonna be good on the judgment day
[1:14:58] god's gonna ask you about you
[1:15:00] and that right okay let's go with jesus
[1:15:02] and look what he had to say here
[1:15:04] if i can find it here
[1:15:08] all right
[1:15:12] in g in matthew
[1:15:18] 23 13 let me see if i got that one right
[1:15:23] yes matthew 23 13 will begin
[1:15:26] all right and he was preaching to him
[1:15:29] and he was talking about how the
[1:15:30] greatest of among you shall be servant
[1:15:32] of all and so forth and whosoever shall
[1:15:34] exalt himself to your base
[1:15:36] he that humbles himself shall be exalted
[1:15:38] but woe unto you
[1:15:39] scribes and pharisees for ye shut up the
[1:15:42] kingdom of heaven against men
[1:15:44] for you neither go in yourselves neither
[1:15:46] suffer ye them
[1:15:48] that are to entering in to go in
[1:15:52] notice go unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:15:55] hypocrites for you devour widows houses
[1:15:58] and for pretense make long prayers
[1:16:02] he was really telling them how they were
[1:16:06] therefore ye shall receive the greater
[1:16:08] damnation
[1:16:09] woe unto you scribes pharisees for you
[1:16:12] can pass
[1:16:12] land and sea to make one proselyte
[1:16:16] and that right and when he is made
[1:16:19] you make him twice the child of hell
[1:16:22] than you are yourselves
[1:16:26] what he do blind guides which say
[1:16:29] whosoever shall swear by the temple it
[1:16:31] is nothing but whosoever shall swear by
[1:16:33] the gold of the temple he
[1:16:35] is a deader ye fools and blind
[1:16:38] for whether is greater than gold or the
[1:16:41] temple that sanctifieth the gold
[1:16:43] and whosoever shall swear by the altar
[1:16:45] it is nothing
[1:16:46] but whosoever sweareth by the gift that
[1:16:48] is upon it
[1:16:49] he is guilty he fools and blind
[1:16:55] i don't know about you but sitting in
[1:16:56] the congregation you looked at and
[1:16:57] called
[1:16:58] you fool and blind you hypocrite you
[1:17:01] snake in the grass
[1:17:03] that would be hard to take it was hard
[1:17:05] for them to take
[1:17:06] but it was the truth
[1:17:10] all right let's go on down to verse
[1:17:15] 23 woe up to you scribes and pharisees
[1:17:17] hypocrites
[1:17:18] for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and
[1:17:21] coming
[1:17:22] amen and have committed the weightier
[1:17:25] matters of the law
[1:17:26] omitted the weightier matters of the law
[1:17:28] judgment
[1:17:29] and mercy and faith these ought ye to
[1:17:32] have done
[1:17:32] and not to leave the other undone
[1:17:36] you blind guides which strain out of
[1:17:38] that and swallow a camel
[1:17:42] woe unto you scribes pharisees
[1:17:44] hypocrites for you may clean the outside
[1:17:46] of the cup
[1:17:47] of the platter but within you are full
[1:17:50] of extortion and excess
[1:17:54] he was really getting on the money he
[1:17:56] was painting them a picture
[1:17:58] this is what we really are up to now
[1:18:01] maybe john the baptist corrected you but
[1:18:03] up to now you've just kind of had your
[1:18:05] way
[1:18:06] but it's time that you find out who you
[1:18:08] really are
[1:18:10] i don't think i'll even get to it here i
[1:18:12] don't think it's in here but remember he
[1:18:13] talks about getting into an argument
[1:18:15] with about whose father he was and
[1:18:17] they called him the devil and so forth
[1:18:19] and beelzebub and he ended up saying no
[1:18:21] you are of your father the devil
[1:18:26] a true picture he told him exactly what
[1:18:27] they were of
[1:18:29] amen and we'll get when we get to
[1:18:32] stephen we'll kind of find out
[1:18:34] and and talk about how that israel
[1:18:36] within israel how many within within
[1:18:38] israel there were three kinds of
[1:18:39] believers that right
[1:18:41] it was a real believers joshua and caleb
[1:18:43] the real genuine believers
[1:18:45] and most of the rest of them were
[1:18:46] unbelievers or make believers
[1:18:48] amen and it was those make believers
[1:18:52] that had always that jesus is talking to
[1:18:54] right here
[1:18:56] now notice full of access and extortion
[1:18:58] thou blind pharisees
[1:19:00] cleanse first that which is within the
[1:19:02] cup of the platter
[1:19:04] that the outside may be clean also how
[1:19:07] many believes that's what we believe
[1:19:09] that a person has to get clean on the
[1:19:11] inside because you know we want people
[1:19:13] clean
[1:19:13] on the outside yes we do but guess what
[1:19:16] if you are clean on the outside and you
[1:19:17] still not clean the inside you're still
[1:19:19] as lost as can be
[1:19:20] but the idea is to get first get the
[1:19:23] inside clean
[1:19:24] and then it'll take care of itself amen
[1:19:28] woe unto you scribes pharisees
[1:19:30] hypocrites for you're like into
[1:19:32] white ed tombs or sepulchers which
[1:19:34] indeed a pure beautiful artwork
[1:19:37] but are within full of death man's bones
[1:19:42] what a reflection in other words we put
[1:19:46] the light of god on you
[1:19:48] all we see is skeleton here folks that
[1:19:51] casket is beautiful man it's got gold
[1:19:53] decorations out around
[1:19:54] isn't that what our caskets look like
[1:19:56] our caskets look beautiful man it'd be a
[1:19:58] nice place to lay down
[1:20:00] at but it's a
[1:20:03] god i don't want to be laying in it to
[1:20:04] you it's beautiful
[1:20:06] but inside it's just a dead person
[1:20:10] that's exactly what jesus said if you
[1:20:12] take a good look at yourself pharisees
[1:20:14] and scribes
[1:20:15] you look good on the outside and you
[1:20:17] like the uppermost seats and you like to
[1:20:19] be called rabbi
[1:20:20] and you know all these other but inside
[1:20:23] you're full of
[1:20:25] dead men's bones amen
[1:20:29] my what a picture to paint for him
[1:20:33] dead man's bone and of all uncleanness
[1:20:40] amen this comes to my mind i believe
[1:20:42] it's the prophet of god that illustrated
[1:20:44] a woman
[1:20:45] that'll wear the garment that pertains
[1:20:46] to a man that it's an abomination you go
[1:20:49] into one of these
[1:20:50] bathrooms he said that is so stinky and
[1:20:52] so horrible
[1:20:53] so unclean until you just wanna you just
[1:20:57] walk out say look i'm gonna go down to
[1:20:59] the next town or the next gas they might
[1:21:01] use in that
[1:21:02] it's just a terrible the more thing you
[1:21:04] can imagine
[1:21:06] that's what it smells like that's what
[1:21:07] it's like an abomination in the side of
[1:21:09] god
[1:21:11] a true picture of what it really is amen
[1:21:14] now notice even so ye
[1:21:15] also outwardly appear righteous unto men
[1:21:18] but within you are full of hypocrisy
[1:21:21] and iniquity
[1:21:25] what do you scribe pharisees hypocrites
[1:21:27] because you build the tombs of the
[1:21:29] prophets
[1:21:30] and garnish the sepulcher of the
[1:21:33] righteous
[1:21:34] and say if we had been in the days of
[1:21:36] our father
[1:21:37] we would not have been partakers with
[1:21:39] them in the blood of the prophets
[1:21:42] lord we'd have been on the right side
[1:21:44] we'd have been in the right group
[1:21:46] if we'd have been back there but brother
[1:21:48] abraham even says here in your present
[1:21:50] state
[1:21:50] in your present mind the way that you
[1:21:53] are now shows
[1:21:54] whose side you would have been on who
[1:21:57] you really are
[1:22:00] amen wherefore ye be witnesses unto
[1:22:03] yourselves that you are the children of
[1:22:05] them
[1:22:06] which killed the prophets fill you
[1:22:09] up the measure of your fathers you
[1:22:11] serpents
[1:22:12] you generation of vipers how can you
[1:22:15] escape the damnation of hell
[1:22:21] what a picture to pick somebody
[1:22:25] how many knows another place jesus said
[1:22:26] they took up stones to stone him
[1:22:28] he preached and he painted them such a
[1:22:30] picture until they got so mad and they
[1:22:32] picked up stones and stoned him
[1:22:34] and he had to vanish through the midst
[1:22:35] of them
[1:22:37] how many knows jesus could do a
[1:22:38] disappearing act it wasn't his time to
[1:22:40] go
[1:22:41] he walked right through the middle of
[1:22:42] him they couldn't even see
[1:22:45] it wasn't his time when he preached he
[1:22:48] let the mirror
[1:22:49] put the held up the mirror in front of
[1:22:50] him this is what you really look like
[1:22:53] you're a generation of vipers and snakes
[1:22:56] outside you look good but
[1:22:58] what do you look like in here i mean at
[1:23:00] least that's what we got to ask
[1:23:01] ourselves what do we look like
[1:23:03] in here amen
[1:23:07] mine praise be to god and i believe i'm
[1:23:10] preaching to a group
[1:23:12] amen that is of the uh
[1:23:15] joshua and caleb i don't believe anybody
[1:23:18] here is ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:23:20] christ to witness to anybody that god
[1:23:22] gives you an opportunity to
[1:23:24] to stand for the word of god amen but
[1:23:27] little further listen he says
[1:23:28] degeneration of vipers
[1:23:29] how can you escape the damnation of hell
[1:23:31] wherefore
[1:23:32] behold i send unto you
[1:23:36] prophets and wise men and scribes
[1:23:39] and some of them ye shall kill
[1:23:42] and crucify was that it was the jews
[1:23:46] that said
[1:23:47] crucify him crucified they're the ones
[1:23:49] that had him crucified anyway
[1:23:53] that's why the jews get so much flack
[1:23:57] do you know why the jews get hated by a
[1:23:59] lot of people why there's what they call
[1:24:00] anti-semitism
[1:24:03] is because they killed the lord and
[1:24:05] people hold that against them
[1:24:07] huh because he take the ones that killed
[1:24:09] jesus and so forth
[1:24:11] but we know that god had blinded their
[1:24:13] eyes amen
[1:24:14] he knew they'd be that way and he did it
[1:24:17] for us
[1:24:19] amen we've got to say thank you lord
[1:24:20] have mercy off on them have them great
[1:24:25] that was where it was predicted to go
[1:24:27] people
[1:24:28] and some of them you shall scourge in
[1:24:31] your synagogue and persecute them
[1:24:33] from city to city so we can say what you
[1:24:37] do with god's scribe
[1:24:41] what you do with god's wise man what you
[1:24:43] do with the word of god today
[1:24:45] is what you'd have done with it back
[1:24:46] then
[1:24:48] well i don't want to be called no holy
[1:24:50] roller i don't want to be called no
[1:24:51] branhamite
[1:24:53] huh i don't know about you but even
[1:24:56] nicodemus he said i ain't nobody can do
[1:24:58] these things unless he of god i mean if
[1:25:00] ain't no brother bannon could have never
[1:25:02] done these things
[1:25:04] unless god was with him
[1:25:07] now people might want to go somewhere
[1:25:09] else and i don't know i never can't
[1:25:10] understand
[1:25:11] a person can leave the message i have to
[1:25:12] really have a revelation of it i don't
[1:25:14] believe you can if you've got a real
[1:25:15] revelation of it
[1:25:16] maybe a mental understanding but a real
[1:25:20] revelation you can't never walk away
[1:25:21] from it because
[1:25:22] to whom shall we go
[1:25:26] let me say this god may think there may
[1:25:28] be things in this message that you just
[1:25:29] don't understand
[1:25:31] you just can't really get past it but
[1:25:34] what do you say
[1:25:35] i don't understand it i don't know why
[1:25:36] jesus told them unless you eat my flesh
[1:25:38] and make my blood but abandon one place
[1:25:40] he said he'd said that
[1:25:42] to thin down the crowd
[1:25:45] am i right sometimes he'll say anything
[1:25:47] it's nothing but the truth but he'll
[1:25:49] find out whether they
[1:25:50] are going along with him just for the
[1:25:52] meat and for the food
[1:25:54] or whether they're really going to
[1:25:55] believe his word whether they understand
[1:25:57] it or not
[1:25:58] because one thing we know for sure is
[1:26:00] that no man could have ever done these
[1:26:02] things unless it was of god
[1:26:04] and there ain't nowhere else to go but
[1:26:07] jesus christ
[1:26:08] he alone has the words of eternal life
[1:26:11] amen all right we're going to stop there
[1:26:14] persecute from city to city and then of
[1:26:17] course he talks about
[1:26:18] you know all the all the blood of
[1:26:20] righteous abel to sacrifice it all comes
[1:26:23] down on them
[1:26:24] o jerusalem doubted kill us the prophets
[1:26:26] the stoneless them that are sent thee i
[1:26:27] guess i will read it
[1:26:28] how often i would have gathered the
[1:26:30] chickens together even as the hens
[1:26:32] gathered her brood
[1:26:33] and you would not i can say it thus
[1:26:36] saith the spirit
[1:26:38] thus saith the word of god that jesus
[1:26:40] did very
[1:26:41] same thing in our generation even the
[1:26:44] prophet said if i could see the baptist
[1:26:45] in the mess of us and everybody come
[1:26:47] together and love the lord
[1:26:48] i could say you know let your servant
[1:26:50] depart in peace
[1:26:52] he tried to get him all back to the word
[1:26:54] back to christ
[1:26:55] now how you would have gathered them but
[1:26:58] they would not
[1:27:00] and that's where they are amen
[1:27:03] one more before i go to stephen let's go
[1:27:06] one more over here
[1:27:07] where jesus talks about uh in matthew 7
[1:27:10] verse 15
[1:27:14] he says beware of false prophets which
[1:27:18] come to you in
[1:27:19] sheep's clothing but inwardly they are
[1:27:22] ravening rules
[1:27:27] how many believes the things that you do
[1:27:29] show who you are
[1:27:31] the decision to make shows you are
[1:27:35] shows who you are everything you do
[1:27:39] shows who you are
[1:27:44] then he says you shall look them by
[1:27:48] their fruit amen
[1:27:52] how many remember i'm talking about uh a
[1:27:55] justified person
[1:27:56] sanctified person or person that's all
[1:27:59] the way inside of the holies of holies
[1:28:02] a justified person come to church and
[1:28:03] whoo praise be to god he's justified
[1:28:06] maybe even sanctified
[1:28:08] he could shout and so forth you know but
[1:28:09] they got they can't
[1:28:11] barely blast from one revival to another
[1:28:14] it isn't just automatically coming
[1:28:16] drinking from the spring but they have
[1:28:18] to be pumped up and primed
[1:28:20] huh lord help us not to be that way we
[1:28:23] gotta come to church and get primed up
[1:28:25] let me get no
[1:28:26] you come primed already you come in tune
[1:28:28] already
[1:28:30] drinking at the well even that springing
[1:28:32] up into everlasting life
[1:28:34] that's where we want to be
[1:28:39] he says you shall know them by their
[1:28:41] fruits do men gather
[1:28:42] grapes of thorns or figs of fizzles even
[1:28:45] so every good tree bringeth forth good
[1:28:47] fruit
[1:28:50] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[1:28:52] fruit
[1:28:53] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[1:28:55] fruit neither can a crop tree
[1:28:57] bring forth good fruit in other words
[1:29:00] sooner or later
[1:29:01] what you do and what's going to come out
[1:29:04] what you are is going to come out
[1:29:07] amen every tree that bringeth forth not
[1:29:10] good fruit
[1:29:11] is hewn down and cast into the fire
[1:29:13] wherefore
[1:29:14] by their fruits ye shall know them
[1:29:17] now notice not everyone that saith unto
[1:29:20] me lord lord
[1:29:22] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:29:24] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:29:26] which is
[1:29:26] in heaven now i'm not going to go to it
[1:29:28] i don't think it's here
[1:29:29] yeah it is now notice he says which is
[1:29:32] in heaven
[1:29:32] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:29:34] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:29:37] and in thy name cast out
[1:29:39] devils and in thy name and many
[1:29:42] mighty and wonderful works
[1:29:46] we spoke in tongue we had miracles
[1:29:48] happen we had this out of the other
[1:29:51] but we kicked your prophet out we could
[1:29:53] you out
[1:29:54] when you would come and discern thoughts
[1:29:55] and intense we wouldn't have no part of
[1:29:57] that
[1:29:58] huh see there's a group
[1:30:01] in the unbelieving world in the
[1:30:02] make-believing world
[1:30:04] that have a cane religion
[1:30:07] that cane religion is we're going to do
[1:30:09] it our way
[1:30:11] i can make it the way i want to come
[1:30:13] i'll bring fruits i ain't got to go out
[1:30:15] there and get no
[1:30:16] lamb and cut its throat and have blood
[1:30:18] splattering everywhere
[1:30:20] and get it all over me and get all messy
[1:30:22] you know and say god forgive me
[1:30:24] i should be this lamb i should die for
[1:30:26] my sin
[1:30:27] you know identified with his son i don't
[1:30:29] want to know no he didn't want to do all
[1:30:30] he brought the fruit
[1:30:31] and you know when god corrected him he
[1:30:33] would not be
[1:30:35] corrected cain religion is that when
[1:30:39] that correction comes and you don't take
[1:30:41] that correction you are identified as
[1:30:44] religion like cain
[1:30:48] lord help me lord if you want to correct
[1:30:50] me here i am
[1:30:51] correct me who the lord loveth he
[1:30:53] chastens us chastises
[1:30:55] corrects amen and if you're a son and
[1:30:59] daughter of god if you're
[1:31:00] a joshua and caleb you say boy i'll tell
[1:31:02] you what lord show me where i'm wrong at
[1:31:05] i want to be right i want to have
[1:31:07] everything right
[1:31:08] now notice here this is the group that
[1:31:10] on that day
[1:31:11] notice they'll come and say that and
[1:31:13] then when i profess unto them
[1:31:14] i never knew you depart from me
[1:31:18] ye that work iniquity you knew
[1:31:22] better but you just refused to do it
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:30] therefore whosoever heareth these
[1:31:32] sayings of mine
[1:31:34] and doeth them i would liken
[1:31:37] him unto a wise man which built his
[1:31:39] house upon
[1:31:40] rock the reigns descended and the floods
[1:31:43] came we certainly have had that this
[1:31:45] morning
[1:31:45] and the winds blew and beat upon that
[1:31:48] house and it fell not
[1:31:49] for it was founded upon a
[1:31:52] rock how many knows that's exactly what
[1:31:55] happened with the disciples now
[1:31:57] ultimately we know that disciples ended
[1:31:59] up forsaking jesus
[1:32:01] but that was a different story because
[1:32:03] they were not converted yet
[1:32:05] they didn't have the holy ghost yet
[1:32:07] because peter after he got the holy
[1:32:08] ghost and converted
[1:32:09] it was going to hang him upside crucify
[1:32:12] him and he says don't
[1:32:13] cruise me find me upright like him i'm
[1:32:16] not worthy to be
[1:32:17] hung in the same way to hit hang me
[1:32:19] upside down
[1:32:22] peter was one of these real rumbunctious
[1:32:25] i guess you would call it guys
[1:32:27] that went a little bit too far he went
[1:32:29] 150
[1:32:30] whatever he did right because whenever
[1:32:32] jesus was going to wash his feet and he
[1:32:34] says
[1:32:34] you'll never wash my feet no you ain't
[1:32:37] going to get down there watch me you're
[1:32:38] my lord
[1:32:39] you know and jesus if i watch you not i
[1:32:42] have no power with me
[1:32:43] then he goes overboard he says well not
[1:32:45] just my feet but my hands and my head
[1:32:47] also
[1:32:48] peter's like jesus would you just settle
[1:32:50] down
[1:32:51] and remember when jesus peter says you
[1:32:53] know i'll never leave you i'll never
[1:32:55] forsake you i'll die with you and so
[1:32:57] forth jesus said no
[1:32:58] i know you're enthusiastic peter but
[1:33:00] before the cockroach christ you'll deny
[1:33:02] me
[1:33:03] twice you'll throw deny me thrice
[1:33:06] that's the kind of peter kind of person
[1:33:08] that peter was i mean if peter had a
[1:33:10] revelation
[1:33:11] no matter what happened no matter how
[1:33:13] much he cried
[1:33:14] not much how much he repented when jesus
[1:33:16] came back
[1:33:17] amen peter fell right in line he kept
[1:33:21] believing
[1:33:22] all the way amen they were sure they
[1:33:23] were discouraged but through it all
[1:33:26] they hang in there amen praise the lord
[1:33:31] and that's how we want to be that no
[1:33:33] matter what happens no matter what comes
[1:33:35] or what goes
[1:33:37] we stay faithful to the lord jesus
[1:33:39] christ amen
[1:33:41] because we're walking into a certain
[1:33:43] part of the symphony now
[1:33:44] we're in the last days when luke
[1:33:47] warmness is all around us
[1:33:48] when it's easy to let the cares of life
[1:33:52] and they're right the cares of life
[1:33:54] choke out the spiritual life that's in
[1:33:57] you
[1:33:58] amen i'll tell you what it's easy to get
[1:34:01] away from god and it's easy to not have
[1:34:03] your prayer like you should in the
[1:34:04] morning
[1:34:05] i had my prayer in the morning but on
[1:34:06] the way to church amen with all of this
[1:34:08] flood coming down
[1:34:11] i wasn't looking at the negative i said
[1:34:12] lord i know it's you
[1:34:14] because your bible i read over over
[1:34:16] there and i believe he's probably before
[1:34:18] he talks he is the one that brings rain
[1:34:20] down
[1:34:21] amen to give a thirsty world water and i
[1:34:23] said boy you're sure giving the world a
[1:34:25] lot of good water
[1:34:26] thank you for the water lord we need it
[1:34:29] thank you lord for my you take care of
[1:34:31] the birds you take care of the animal
[1:34:33] world you take care of us
[1:34:35] thank you lord you're just a wonderful
[1:34:37] provider
[1:34:38] you provide for everything you're
[1:34:40] awesome god
[1:34:42] amen just keep god real in your hearts
[1:34:46] don't let the cares of this world don't
[1:34:48] fall in that category
[1:34:50] identification that the cares of this
[1:34:52] life is
[1:34:53] choked out your fervency and your love
[1:34:56] for the lord jesus christ
[1:34:58] because that's what this really ought to
[1:34:59] see and remember this layout is here
[1:35:01] that's what the devil has called that's
[1:35:03] what its whole purpose is
[1:35:05] is just to drown us with the cares of
[1:35:07] this world the pleasures of this world
[1:35:10] because it's not to have amen anymore
[1:35:13] god help us never to become unidentified
[1:35:15] it's a church where there's no
[1:35:16] hallelujahs
[1:35:17] no amens it's about got icicles hanging
[1:35:20] off of these here
[1:35:21] ceilings up here everything's so cold
[1:35:23] and everybody's so started
[1:35:26] never be identified that but free in the
[1:35:28] spirit the holy spirit can move
[1:35:31] god can do stuff and amen amen believes
[1:35:33] he is
[1:35:35] but i just want to see more and i say
[1:35:36] god this is where i want to be
[1:35:38] identified amen
[1:35:39] because i believe as i wrote here one
[1:35:42] place
[1:35:43] he says you know that he went god made a
[1:35:45] supper right
[1:35:46] and he invited all of his friends and
[1:35:48] all of those relatives to come
[1:35:49] and all of those relatives said they had
[1:35:52] an excuse well we can't come because of
[1:35:54] this and we can't come because of that
[1:35:55] although they made excuses and he says
[1:35:57] those people
[1:35:58] are not going to have any part but he
[1:36:00] says talk to servants now go out into
[1:36:02] highways and the hedges
[1:36:03] i believe it was three different places
[1:36:05] go out and die to neighbor and so forth
[1:36:06] there was still room he says now go out
[1:36:08] into the highways and the hedges and
[1:36:11] compel
[1:36:12] them to come in so that i will have
[1:36:14] people and my supper
[1:36:15] that right to me i was one of those that
[1:36:18] was in the highways and the hedges
[1:36:20] i wasn't religious i was unworthy
[1:36:24] amen just nobody and nothing but yet he
[1:36:27] went out into those highways and those
[1:36:28] hedges
[1:36:29] amen and he found me amen called and i'm
[1:36:32] thankful that i responded aren't you
[1:36:34] glad you responded
[1:36:36] to that call that god gave you to come
[1:36:38] in and to dine
[1:36:39] with him to sup with him amen
[1:36:43] when there's so many putting them out
[1:36:45] people not really wanting to look in the
[1:36:47] mirror of god's word anymore
[1:36:49] people don't want to be honest with
[1:36:50] themselves so like all i can tell you
[1:36:53] this morning is
[1:36:53] be honest with yourself look in the
[1:36:56] mirror of god's word and see if you are
[1:36:58] you know and and he said
[1:37:02] brother branham used it and said that
[1:37:03] boy seen his reflection right
[1:37:06] but when we look into this we don't want
[1:37:07] to see our reflection
[1:37:10] we want to see his reflection we want to
[1:37:13] see christ reflected
[1:37:15] in our lives that it reflects christ yes
[1:37:17] that's me
[1:37:18] no we're not like nathan and cora amen
[1:37:22] i told you i was going to go with steven
[1:37:23] yet let's talk about stephen for a few
[1:37:25] minutes
[1:37:25] is that okay let's turn to acts
[1:37:29] the book of acts
[1:37:35] and stephen as you know he was brought
[1:37:38] up before the council
[1:37:40] all right
[1:37:45] let me see way back and he preached him
[1:37:47] a sermon we're not going to get into
[1:37:48] that if you want to read that whole
[1:37:49] sermon that he gave it
[1:37:51] he gave all the way from started in the
[1:37:53] seventh chapter of acts
[1:37:55] amen he's talked about abraham coming
[1:37:57] from mesopotamia
[1:37:59] amen to dwell in the land of charan and
[1:38:02] so forth and
[1:38:03] how did god called him and so forth but
[1:38:05] in verse
[1:38:07] chapter 6 the last verse
[1:38:10] it says and all that sat in the console
[1:38:14] looking steadfastly on him saw his face
[1:38:18] as it had been the face of an angel
[1:38:22] and stephen was given an opportunity to
[1:38:25] speak to that whole
[1:38:27] council and he preached them a message
[1:38:29] of how god
[1:38:30] uh started with abraham and come into
[1:38:33] egypt and
[1:38:34] all the way down and then i want to pick
[1:38:37] a thought up
[1:38:38] over in the wilderness he stopped in the
[1:38:40] middle the middle of the wilderness
[1:38:43] any in verse 37 he says and this
[1:38:46] that moses which said unto the children
[1:38:49] of israel
[1:38:50] a prophet shall the lord your god raise
[1:38:52] up unto you
[1:38:53] of your brethren like and unto me him
[1:38:56] shall ye hear
[1:38:58] and this is he that was in the church in
[1:39:00] the wilderness with an angel
[1:39:02] which spake to him in the mount sinai
[1:39:06] and with our fathers whom received the
[1:39:08] lively oracles
[1:39:10] to give unto us to whom our fathers
[1:39:13] would not obey now if you'll notice
[1:39:18] stephen ties these pharisees in
[1:39:21] with the ones that would not obey
[1:39:25] but thrust him from them and in their
[1:39:27] hearts turned
[1:39:28] back unto egypt saying unto aaron
[1:39:31] this is how he turned them away didn't
[1:39:34] want moses no more
[1:39:35] they wanted to go back to egypt okay
[1:39:37] turn back again to egypt saying on the
[1:39:39] air
[1:39:39] make us a gods to go before us for as
[1:39:42] for this moses which brought us
[1:39:44] out of the land of egypt we will what
[1:39:48] not
[1:39:48] we don't know what is become of him and
[1:39:51] they made a calf in those days
[1:39:53] and offered the sacrifice unto an idol
[1:39:56] and rejoice in the works
[1:39:58] of their hands and then he goes on to
[1:40:00] talk about how that god rejected him for
[1:40:02] it
[1:40:03] but let's go over here to verse
[1:40:07] about 48 we will read it all hobby at
[1:40:09] the most high dwelleth not in
[1:40:11] temples made with hands as saith the
[1:40:13] prophet heaven is my throne and earth is
[1:40:16] my footstall
[1:40:17] what footstool what else will ye build
[1:40:19] me saith the lord
[1:40:20] what is the place of my rest have not my
[1:40:23] hands made all these things
[1:40:24] ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in
[1:40:28] heart and ears you do always resist the
[1:40:31] holy ghost
[1:40:32] this is what stephen was telling that
[1:40:34] congregation
[1:40:37] told them look as your fathers did
[1:40:41] so do ye remember he mentioned about
[1:40:45] nathan the corn there
[1:40:47] and so forth he says as your fathers did
[1:40:49] so do you
[1:40:50] stephen is painting him a picture of who
[1:40:52] they really are
[1:40:54] in that console to the whole sanhedrin
[1:40:56] council
[1:40:57] he's saying you stiff-necked an
[1:41:00] uncircumcised of heart and ears
[1:41:02] listen to what he says which of the
[1:41:04] prophets have not your fathers
[1:41:07] persecuted and they have slain them
[1:41:10] which showed before of the coming of the
[1:41:14] just one
[1:41:15] whom ye have been now betrayers
[1:41:20] and murderers he calls them a bunch of
[1:41:23] traitors
[1:41:24] and murderers to their face just like
[1:41:27] your fathers
[1:41:30] whom ye who who have received the law by
[1:41:33] dispensation of angels
[1:41:34] and have not kept it when they heard
[1:41:37] these things they were
[1:41:38] cut to the heart and they gnashed on him
[1:41:43] with their teeth just what that means i
[1:41:46] don't know
[1:41:47] if he just bunch of just talking real
[1:41:50] bad about him if they actually beat him
[1:41:51] i don't know
[1:41:52] gnashed on him with their teeth in other
[1:41:55] words the picture that he
[1:41:57] held the mirror up say this is where you
[1:42:00] guys are at
[1:42:01] you did that back there you wanted to go
[1:42:03] back to egypt back there
[1:42:04] you never would believe in that right
[1:42:07] and now you've taken the just
[1:42:09] one that abraham did you claim the
[1:42:11] followings of earth moses
[1:42:13] he says do you know god is going to
[1:42:14] raise up a prophet like an unto me
[1:42:16] and he did it and you are the murderers
[1:42:18] of him
[1:42:20] my and he being full of the holy ghost
[1:42:25] looked up steadfastly into heaven and
[1:42:27] saw the glory of god and jesus standing
[1:42:29] at the right hand of god
[1:42:30] and said behold i see heavens open
[1:42:34] and the son son of man standing at the
[1:42:36] right hand of god
[1:42:39] and then they cried out with a loud
[1:42:41] voice and stopped their ears
[1:42:43] they began screaming and hollering and
[1:42:46] shutting their ears
[1:42:47] i ain't listening to this no more i
[1:42:49] ain't gonna hear this no more
[1:42:54] that was terrible can you imagine the
[1:42:56] people that would be shown the mirror of
[1:42:58] how they really are
[1:43:00] they don't want to and let me tell you
[1:43:02] something if you ain't a child of god
[1:43:03] you don't want to be hearing what you
[1:43:05] what you really are
[1:43:06] i don't want to hear i ain't going to
[1:43:08] listen to it that's how they were they
[1:43:10] were i ain't gonna listen to it i ain't
[1:43:12] gonna hear
[1:43:13] amen oh my and upon him with one accord
[1:43:17] and cast him out of the city
[1:43:20] and stoned him and the witnesses laid
[1:43:23] down their coats
[1:43:24] at a young man's feet whose name was
[1:43:26] saul
[1:43:27] amen
[1:43:31] and they stoned stephen calling upon god
[1:43:35] and saying lord jesus receive my spirit
[1:43:38] it makes it sound like the one stoning
[1:43:41] stephen was calling upon the lord but i
[1:43:42] don't believe that's how that means it
[1:43:44] and they stoned stephen calling upon god
[1:43:48] saying
[1:43:49] lord jesus receive my spirit i believe
[1:43:52] jesus was saying
[1:43:53] here i am receive my spirit and he
[1:43:56] kneeled down
[1:43:57] and cried with a loud voice lord
[1:44:01] lay not this sin to their charge and
[1:44:04] when he had said this
[1:44:06] he fell asleep we sing this song there
[1:44:10] was peter and paul
[1:44:11] and john the devine who gave their lives
[1:44:15] blood so this gospel could shine
[1:44:18] it talks about stephen they dashed his
[1:44:20] head in
[1:44:22] is that right dashing his head on
[1:44:24] because he showed them the true picture
[1:44:27] of how they were sometimes when the
[1:44:30] mirror reflects through god's servants
[1:44:32] or
[1:44:33] you know sometimes kids at school
[1:44:36] you'll dress right and they'll make fun
[1:44:39] of you and they'll despite you just
[1:44:41] because
[1:44:42] they feel condemned because they know
[1:44:43] they should you know right
[1:44:45] they don't like it just because that
[1:44:47] light is reflecting out through
[1:44:50] you to others and people will hate you
[1:44:52] for it
[1:44:53] amen but how many beliefs each and every
[1:44:55] one of us is a reflector of the word of
[1:44:57] god
[1:44:58] amen let's stand this morning
[1:45:03] stephen was paul was
[1:45:07] amen jesus was john was
[1:45:11] prophet of god in this generation was
[1:45:14] and even though jesus christ would come
[1:45:17] and do
[1:45:18] all those miracles that he would do
[1:45:20] after he was finished preaching
[1:45:22] people still did what they might as well
[1:45:25] done that he might as well just
[1:45:26] that no huh then brother ben says well
[1:45:30] you know even when he began to talk
[1:45:34] about paul
[1:45:35] when paul was testifying to israel who
[1:45:38] had
[1:45:39] really wanted to kill paul because he
[1:45:41] had went and become a christian and so
[1:45:42] forth
[1:45:43] found themselves not to eat or drink
[1:45:45] until he was dead
[1:45:47] but he had seen a vision paul would just
[1:45:50] testify of the vision that he saw and
[1:45:51] how he was struck down
[1:45:53] this is all i can tell you is what
[1:45:54] happened to me huh
[1:45:57] they didn't want to hear it and then
[1:45:59] brother branham went there and he began
[1:46:01] to tell holland and when he was young
[1:46:02] and
[1:46:03] how that angel came to him he began to
[1:46:05] say this stuff and
[1:46:07] he says there was a whole row of
[1:46:08] ministers in the back he says when he
[1:46:10] began to bring up paul
[1:46:11] he says they know where he was going
[1:46:13] they got up and left
[1:46:15] they all went up went out
[1:46:18] can you imagine what they look like in
[1:46:21] god's sight
[1:46:23] can you imagine what the mirror looks
[1:46:26] like for them
[1:46:28] or for the 70 just because they couldn't
[1:46:30] quite understand what he said
[1:46:32] walked away something happened
[1:46:36] amen let's bow our heads
[1:46:40] i don't know but i want to be in that
[1:46:42] group like peter like the disciples that
[1:46:45] no matter what happened
[1:46:47] to whom shall we go no matter what
[1:46:50] happens i believe it with all of my
[1:46:51] heart
[1:46:53] like stephen that though they slay me
[1:47:00] people people even get upset with god
[1:47:02] sometimes because of the things that
[1:47:04] they
[1:47:04] go through but i want to be like david
[1:47:07] says though he slay me
[1:47:08] yet i'll trust him no matter what
[1:47:11] happens
[1:47:12] i'll still believe in god i want to be a
[1:47:15] real
[1:47:16] genuine believer i don't want to be a
[1:47:18] make-believer i don't want to get over
[1:47:20] on that day i don't want to be a part of
[1:47:21] the group that comes over on that day
[1:47:24] and thinks that you had and thinks that
[1:47:25] you was all right
[1:47:27] and you wasn't because you really
[1:47:29] deceived yourself you didn't take a good
[1:47:30] enough
[1:47:31] look you wasn't honest enough with
[1:47:33] yourself
[1:47:34] how many this morning would raise their
[1:47:36] hand say god help me to be honest
[1:47:38] help me be honest with myself and let me
[1:47:40] look in the mirror of your word every
[1:47:41] time i read your bible
[1:47:42] or listen to a tape lord and there's
[1:47:45] something that isn't there
[1:47:46] that it shouldn't be there i pray god
[1:47:49] you take it out
[1:47:50] i confess all my faults lord help me to
[1:47:52] be like stephen that no matter if they
[1:47:54] even slay me
[1:47:55] no matter what would happen i could have
[1:47:58] that perfect love
[1:47:59] and say god don't lay it at their charge
[1:48:02] lord each one with their hands raised we
[1:48:03] want that in our hearts our lives lord
[1:48:06] we want that perfect love god no matter
[1:48:09] what comes or goes you allow things come
[1:48:11] our way to test us to try us
[1:48:14] to see whether we'll fall by the wayside
[1:48:16] or whether we won't
[1:48:17] or whether we'll stand true to your word
[1:48:20] not ask god this morning that every hand
[1:48:22] that is up
[1:48:23] lord jesus that you'd help them to have
[1:48:25] a closer walk with you father
[1:48:27] that you'd let them be in that group
[1:48:29] that's a genuine
[1:48:31] believer not be like that net that was
