[51:26] amen I just want to Amen to kind of kind
[51:29] of continue on a little bit further on
[51:32] the same line of thought amen that we
[51:35] had
[51:36] um Sunday maybe just a little bit
[51:38] different but
[51:41] um
[51:45] so if you will turn your Bibles we will
[51:48] begin
[51:49] uh I guess with where we left off which
[51:52] would be in Hebrews 6.
[51:54] Hebrews 6
[52:06] .
[52:13] I'm going to read that and then I want
[52:15] to kind of tell you where
[52:17] pretty much my thought came from and
[52:19] then we'll go from there
[52:21] Hebrews 6 and we'll begin with reading a
[52:24] scripture we read Sunday verse 13.
[52:29] for when God made promise to Abraham
[52:32] because he could swear by no greater
[52:34] he swear by himself
[52:37] saying surely surely blessing I Will
[52:41] Bless thee and multiplying I will
[52:43] multiply thee and so after he had
[52:46] patiently endured and that he obtained
[52:48] the promise for men barely swear by the
[52:51] greater and an oath of for confirmation
[52:54] is to them
[52:55] and end of all Strife wherein God
[52:58] willing more abundantly to show unto The
[53:01] Heirs of the promised immutability of
[53:04] his counsel he confirmed it by an oath
[53:08] that by two immutable things in which it
[53:12] is impossible it was impossible for God
[53:14] to
[53:15] lie we might have strong consolation who
[53:19] have fled for Refuge till they hold upon
[53:22] the Hope set before us which hope we
[53:25] have as an anchor of the Soul both sure
[53:27] and steadfast which entereth into that
[53:31] within the veil amen may God have his
[53:33] blessings to the reading of the word you
[53:35] can be seated
[53:36] amen
[53:38] I wanna I was listening to several tapes
[53:40] this week and there is something that
[53:42] brother Benham said that kind of caught
[53:44] my attention and it just kind of let me
[53:47] down this road amen and so this is what
[53:51] he said in end time seed sign Tifton
[53:54] Georgia
[53:55] amen now he says now this is 1962 and
[53:58] what does the Bible say the Bible said
[54:01] in the last stage that the work be cut
[54:03] short for the scriptures cannot lie for
[54:07] The Elixir notice for the elect's sake
[54:10] or there be no flesh saved amen
[54:15] then we
[54:16] see and look at the
[54:19] Church look how it's swallowed up and
[54:21] stuff like in Satan just as easy and
[54:24] Satan has fed them this Corruption of
[54:26] hell and many thousands has believed it
[54:28] amen
[54:30] another place talked about it was like
[54:32] he said he uh I had to quote but it
[54:35] didn't bring he says it's like a great
[54:36] monster almost I mean that is just
[54:39] swallowed the people up the whole world
[54:41] and everybody is just swallowed up amen
[54:43] by the evil basically that is flooded
[54:46] out upon the Earth and that he also
[54:48] mentions he says talks about the work
[54:51] being cut short for the elect's sake or
[54:54] no flesh would be saved
[54:58] what is told meme kind of what it showed
[55:00] me let me just let me let me finish the
[55:02] oh Lord Jesus come Lord you said if the
[55:05] work wasn't cut short there'd be no
[55:08] flesh saved
[55:10] truly Lord we see in amen ourselves
[55:13] today we see the falling away the
[55:16] cooling off or May the remnant that
[55:18] escapes out of this Babylon may it rise
[55:21] and shine may you fill it with the power
[55:23] of God Amen May the Holy Spirit come
[55:26] upon it Lord amen and perform perform
[55:28] great things
[55:30] again and what shall I do with this
[55:32] Jesus called the Christ he says you're
[55:34] either in the Beast or the image of the
[55:36] Beast according to Revelations the Bible
[55:38] said you would be Jesus spoke of this
[55:40] not as communism but in Matthew 24
[55:43] chapter beginning at 21st verse he says
[55:46] he predicts that the spirit of this
[55:48] system would be so much like the real
[55:50] thing that it would deceive the very
[55:53] elected if possible amen the elected
[55:56] whose names are put on the Lamb's Book
[55:58] of Life before the foundation of the
[56:00] world and frankly it got them so tied up
[56:02] until he said if he didn't we'll cut the
[56:05] work Shard for their sake
[56:08] there'd be no flesh saved
[56:12] what does that tell us it tells me that
[56:15] it's going to be really bad
[56:20] if God has to cut the work short
[56:23] or the elected won't even make it
[56:27] isn't that what you're hearing here
[56:31] so it's very deceiving
[56:35] so Connie
[56:38] amen but we know that the elect won't be
[56:41] deceived and we want to talk about the
[56:42] elect with the help of the Lord again
[56:43] tonight A man talking about what who God
[56:46] knew before the foundation of the world
[56:48] wrote their name their names down how
[56:51] many believe that amen and they only the
[56:54] only those that who have that names on
[56:56] it I mean I really like really feel like
[56:59] the Holy Spirit led us on that talking
[57:00] about how to say you know the Bible and
[57:02] I never looked at even that scripture
[57:04] talking about seeing a scripture In a
[57:05] Different Light I mean I always thought
[57:07] you know the whosoever will just let him
[57:09] come that's opening God opening up the
[57:11] way but you know in another way it's
[57:14] actually calling 90 of the people
[57:22] amen come on
[57:27] but we know that so many don't have that
[57:30] thought they certainly don't have the
[57:32] desire to come all the way with Christ
[57:34] they have a desire everybody has The
[57:36] Thirst forgotten someone but not so much
[57:38] that they'd be willing to forsake all to
[57:40] follow him and to take up their cross
[57:42] and to even deny their self and die to
[57:45] theirself amen so they're not willing to
[57:47] go that measure Jesus and if you're not
[57:49] willing to forsake all to follow me
[57:51] you're not worthy to be my disciples
[57:55] amen so tonight's message this is going
[57:59] to be kind of different but I titled
[58:00] into something I've spoke on many times
[58:02] over the years here
[58:04] amen and it's honest speaking I'm going
[58:06] to retitle it I guess but we're going to
[58:08] talk about endurance but I want to call
[58:11] it deep roots
[58:13] I'll talk about Deep Roots
[58:16] amen is that okay praise the Lord let me
[58:19] establish first you know because I
[58:21] thought that I heard him say this and I
[58:23] said well where in the world did the
[58:24] Bible ever talk about him cutting the
[58:27] work short and I says I certainly don't
[58:28] want to go up there and just say
[58:29] something and and not have a scripture
[58:31] for it amen I believe everything should
[58:33] be back up by the scripture don't you
[58:35] amen it's found in Matthew if you want
[58:37] to go with me Matthew 24. amen Matthew
[58:41] the 24th chapter amen but that was the
[58:45] one thing that caught my attention when
[58:47] I was listening to end time seeds on
[58:49] because I'm kind of following and
[58:50] listening to them ever I I the um the
[58:54] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[58:55] then the next few of them just listening
[58:57] to what he said and then the end time
[58:59] seed sign kind of follows a
[59:01] chronological order and so forth and we
[59:03] kept talking about this
[59:06] and when he made that statement about
[59:08] the work being cut short for the elect's
[59:11] sake or there be no flesh saved amen
[59:13] that to me just kind of put me uh kind
[59:15] of on guard heads up isn't that right
[59:18] it's going to be tight
[59:20] I'm gonna be is it gonna be tied
[59:22] amen even if even the elect there's
[59:24] gonna come close it's going to come
[59:26] close that even the elect's gonna be
[59:28] deceived or misled isn't that right or
[59:32] not make it because it's so cunning amen
[59:34] and so I thought well Lord help us amen
[59:37] it's going to take something special for
[59:39] us to make it isn't it
[59:41] amen and it's found it's found in uh
[59:44] Matthew 24.
[59:46] reverse
[59:48] um 21 amen and he was talking about many
[59:51] false prophets Rising iniquity abounding
[59:54] and so forth many shall come a minute
[59:56] saying here's Christ and there is Christ
[59:58] and so forth but in verse 21 it says for
[1:00:01] then shall there be great tribulations
[1:00:04] such as was not since the beginning of
[1:00:06] the world to this time no nor ever shall
[1:00:09] be and accept those those days should be
[1:00:12] shortened there should be no flesh saved
[1:00:15] amen but for the elect's sake those days
[1:00:19] shall be shortened amen amen so when you
[1:00:24] talk about the work of the Lord being
[1:00:25] cut short it's just hard to imagine that
[1:00:27] God would cut
[1:00:29] anything short but but like it talks
[1:00:31] about cutting something short to make
[1:00:33] sure that elect gets in
[1:00:36] amen
[1:00:39] praise the Lord now I want to go to our
[1:00:42] thought here I mean that was just
[1:00:43] established that you know you know and
[1:00:45] God is going to have to have an elect
[1:00:47] and what's going to be inside of this
[1:00:49] elect what we're going to be like now
[1:00:51] notice in verse 11 of the same chapter
[1:00:53] for many false prophets shall arise and
[1:00:55] shall deceive many and because iniquity
[1:00:58] shall abound the love of many shall wax
[1:01:01] code
[1:01:01] but he that shall endure unto thee and
[1:01:06] the same shall be saved
[1:01:10] praise the Lord and I want to talk now
[1:01:11] about that endurance
[1:01:14] there's one thing that that goes along
[1:01:17] with endurances amen faithfulness and
[1:01:19] perseverance and so forth amen it takes
[1:01:22] into
[1:01:23] doors and I thought you know and I
[1:01:25] looked up what Siri had to say about
[1:01:27] endurance and it said the facts or power
[1:01:30] of enduring and unpleasant or difficult
[1:01:33] process or situation without giving way
[1:01:38] amen praise be to God you know what I
[1:01:42] thought you know I'll tell you what
[1:01:43] yummy knows that life is not just all up
[1:01:46] on the Mountaintop experience
[1:01:48] no Eddie I'll tell you what if you
[1:01:51] always was on the Mountaintop everything
[1:01:53] always went good and everything was
[1:01:55] always Pleasant you wouldn't have to
[1:01:58] endure nothing
[1:02:03] is that right
[1:02:04] and the Bible talks much we'll read a
[1:02:06] lot about it but it talks about thee
[1:02:08] that shall endure unto them there's many
[1:02:10] things to endure Amen in Hebrews 12 it
[1:02:13] talks about if you endure chastisement
[1:02:15] amen
[1:02:17] so we have to endure the chastisement
[1:02:20] about God almighty God we have to endure
[1:02:22] time itself we have to endure trials
[1:02:25] where there's a lot to have to endure
[1:02:27] sometimes you all got to endure me I
[1:02:30] gotta endure you amen isn't that right
[1:02:32] we got to endure amen endurance like I
[1:02:35] said again amen it means that it's not
[1:02:38] always going great and wonderful but it
[1:02:40] means that you have the power of in
[1:02:42] doing unpleasant and difficult process
[1:02:45] or a situation amen something that's
[1:02:48] hard something that's not easy
[1:02:50] amen until I thought you know that's
[1:02:52] really really what you're talking about
[1:02:54] is the valley him in the valley part of
[1:02:56] life is where or even a desert
[1:03:03] huh
[1:03:04] amen where you just think you know and
[1:03:06] even coming to this message I you know
[1:03:09] usually I get it real easy but I really
[1:03:10] had to struggle for this when I thought
[1:03:12] Lord you know it usually comes
[1:03:14] easy but Lord one will have whether you
[1:03:16] have for me to speak and I have to
[1:03:18] struggle to pray extra hard and spend
[1:03:20] more time and so forth
[1:03:22] hey man it's all but you know I believe
[1:03:24] God brought us to this but notice how he
[1:03:26] says
[1:03:27] that amen did he that endureth unto the
[1:03:30] end shall be saved way back in
[1:03:32] Revelations amen enduring is something
[1:03:34] going through a long prize of having
[1:03:36] long
[1:03:38] longevity or something like that
[1:03:41] I can't say that word right but yeah I
[1:03:43] think you get what I'm saying maybe
[1:03:45] another uh you gotta you have length you
[1:03:48] got to be able to endure hey man go
[1:03:49] through the process you know and so but
[1:03:52] over in in uh Revelations the second
[1:03:54] chapter in samurna church age the second
[1:03:56] Church age of course we know it's when
[1:03:59] uh when so many hundreds of thousands of
[1:04:02] Christians were being killed he says you
[1:04:04] know fear none of those things which
[1:04:06] Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall
[1:04:08] cast some of you into prison that they
[1:04:10] may be tried and you shall have
[1:04:11] tribulation ten days there was 10 years
[1:04:14] of real tribulation amen where they just
[1:04:17] slaughter them to them slaughtered the
[1:04:18] Christians Real by he says be thou
[1:04:21] faithful unto death and I will give thee
[1:04:23] a Crown of Life I thought that goes
[1:04:25] along with he that is endureth unto the
[1:04:28] end the same shall be saved
[1:04:31] praise the Lord hallelujah cause I'll
[1:04:34] tell you I'll be honest with you you
[1:04:35] know because we see it so much don't we
[1:04:37] we see so much to where people start out
[1:04:40] in the race but they don't finish it we
[1:04:42] got a lot of attitudes sitting right
[1:04:45] here because people that went so far but
[1:04:47] they just couldn't keep on going
[1:04:49] sometimes many many years
[1:04:53] and how many knows that time wears or
[1:04:55] time wears on me
[1:04:58] it wears on you
[1:05:00] those Christians in the Dark Ages they
[1:05:03] got tired of living and they'd be in the
[1:05:05] caves and hide and so forth but they get
[1:05:07] tired of this and I'm gonna go ahead and
[1:05:09] man they go out there and let them know
[1:05:11] they're a Christian to get fed the lives
[1:05:13] it's over with but you know with you
[1:05:15] when I it's a lifetime it's a whole life
[1:05:18] long
[1:05:20] a long long time and every day the devil
[1:05:22] gets another hit at you he'll get to
[1:05:24] he'll get to you know have another hit
[1:05:26] that or God allows you to go through
[1:05:28] more trials
[1:05:30] amen and you have to have endurance we
[1:05:35] are not
[1:05:36] in a 50-yard Dash
[1:05:40] amen we're not in the 50-yard Dash folks
[1:05:43] we're in a marathon
[1:05:45] and how what how many knows any
[1:05:47] but he can run a 50-yard Dash I can run
[1:05:50] to the background up to the front even
[1:05:52] though I'm as old as I am I can still
[1:05:53] run a little Sprint but it ain't gonna
[1:05:55] be very long hello
[1:05:57] why but you in order to have to be able
[1:06:00] to run a marathon you have to have
[1:06:03] endurance
[1:06:05] amen how many knows any endurance
[1:06:06] Runners are running a little bit run a
[1:06:08] little more run a little more run a
[1:06:09] little more running until they finally
[1:06:11] get the distance to where they can
[1:06:12] actually do it
[1:06:13] amen and that's what you and I are are
[1:06:16] on is on a marathon praise be to God
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:21] amen I believe Paul he's he talked about
[1:06:24] it that way he says no ye not the thing
[1:06:26] which run in the race run all but one
[1:06:29] receiveth the prize so run
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:33] oh this comes to mind how many even
[1:06:36] Jesus said when you uh take up the cross
[1:06:39] count the cost whenever you're building
[1:06:41] a tower see if you're able to finish it
[1:06:43] or not how many believes that when
[1:06:45] you're going to be a Christian if you're
[1:06:47] ever going to give your young people if
[1:06:49] you're ever gonna give your life to God
[1:06:50] remember this you gotta say that I'm
[1:06:55] oh and then all my life my whole life
[1:06:58] everything about me I give it to you
[1:07:00] then God will fill you with the Holy
[1:07:02] Ghost and give you the power that you
[1:07:04] need to finish the thing
[1:07:08] otherwise you'll never make it
[1:07:11] amen because I'll tell you what there's
[1:07:14] just too many that don't make it
[1:07:16] amen it's sad
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:20] it's coming real fast can I just say
[1:07:23] when you realize brother John that
[1:07:25] Lord's held you for so many years
[1:07:28] amen how many knows it's the Lord
[1:07:29] holding you it's the Lord that gives you
[1:07:31] that endurance
[1:07:32] the fact that you're still here
[1:07:35] and the fact that you believe that it's
[1:07:36] been God that has held you here and
[1:07:38] you're still running the race
[1:07:41] we're still here
[1:07:44] it ought to make you happy to realize
[1:07:46] hey that that's a that's a good sign
[1:07:48] that you're probably one of those
[1:07:49] elected
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:52] praise be to God you're still striving
[1:07:56] now notice one receiveth the prize so
[1:07:59] run that ye may obtain and every man
[1:08:01] that strives for the Mastery is
[1:08:03] temperate in all things not only knows
[1:08:07] what Temperance Temperance from what I
[1:08:09] understand is
[1:08:11] self-control
[1:08:14] boy the world doesn't have a lick of
[1:08:17] self-control
[1:08:18] they will paint their eyeballs
[1:08:21] huh
[1:08:23] taint everywhere you know a tattoo or
[1:08:26] two isn't good enough no it's got to be
[1:08:28] everywhere come on control yourself
[1:08:31] now there's no such a word is there now
[1:08:34] not to any of them out there don't seem
[1:08:36] like temperate in all things now they do
[1:08:40] it to obtain a corruptable crowd
[1:08:45] and then of course he goes on to
[1:08:47] settlement into the 10th chapter I don't
[1:08:48] really want to get into that but he
[1:08:50] talks about Israel uh the fathers were
[1:08:52] under the cloud they passed in the Red
[1:08:54] Sea they were baptized under Moses they
[1:08:56] all eat spiritual Manna amen but Jesus
[1:08:59] said they were everyone dead
[1:09:02] think about it they started in his race
[1:09:05] but they couldn't finish it it didn't
[1:09:08] finish
[1:09:10] it isn't about starting it's about
[1:09:13] getting to the finish line
[1:09:16] I love about you but that's why this is
[1:09:19] God I am determined I'm gonna get to the
[1:09:22] finish line
[1:09:26] praise God that you have that
[1:09:28] determination that's God putting that
[1:09:31] determination in you everybody else is
[1:09:33] just chilling well I guess maybe maybe
[1:09:36] not
[1:09:37] come on folks you've done relaxed way
[1:09:40] too much already
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:43] all right
[1:09:45] all right so they started but I want to
[1:09:48] go to
[1:09:49] I want to talk a little bit about this
[1:09:50] because when I think about
[1:09:52] endurance
[1:09:55] I want to go to Matthew up no Mark turn
[1:09:57] with me to Matthew and I want to read
[1:09:58] another I want to once again
[1:10:01] read a scripture we're very familiar
[1:10:04] with
[1:10:05] that I've read just here maybe in the
[1:10:07] last few weeks but I want to read it
[1:10:08] again
[1:10:10] mark IV
[1:10:15] and he began to teach by the seaside and
[1:10:18] there was gathered unto him a great
[1:10:19] multitude so he had entered into a ship
[1:10:22] and sat in the sea sat in the sea the
[1:10:25] whole multitude was by the Sea on the
[1:10:28] land and he taught them many things in
[1:10:30] Parables saying unto them in his
[1:10:32] Doctrine heart and behold there went out
[1:10:34] and so were to sow and it came to pass
[1:10:38] it as he sowed some fell by the wayside
[1:10:41] and the fowls of the air came and
[1:10:43] devoured it up the sun fell on Stony
[1:10:46] ground where it had Earth and
[1:10:48] immediately it sprang up but because it
[1:10:51] had no depth of verse when the sun was
[1:10:54] up it was scorched and because it had no
[1:10:59] root
[1:11:01] we're going to talk about that root for
[1:11:02] a little bit is that all right
[1:11:04] now notice Jesus himself
[1:11:06] it withered away and some fellow among
[1:11:10] thorns and they grew up and so forth but
[1:11:13] the other verse 8 fell on good ground
[1:11:16] and did yield fruit that sprang up and
[1:11:19] increased and brought forth some 30 some
[1:11:22] 60 and some a hundred
[1:11:25] so what is it that causes a Christian to
[1:11:28] actually bear fruit and get something is
[1:11:30] because they have the right root system
[1:11:33] they have the right dirt
[1:11:36] praise be to God
[1:11:38] Jesus explains it
[1:11:40] a little bit later on
[1:11:42] if you'll notice let's go all the way
[1:11:44] we're just gonna go to verse 14. Not A
[1:11:48] sower
[1:11:49] sowed the word so with the word and
[1:11:52] these are the by the wayside where the
[1:11:54] word is sown but when they have heard
[1:11:56] Satan cometh immediately and taketh away
[1:11:59] the word that was sown into hearts these
[1:12:02] are likewise which are sown on Stony
[1:12:04] ground which who when they have heard
[1:12:06] the word immediately receive it with
[1:12:08] gladness
[1:12:09] but have no root
[1:12:14] Hallelujah no root in themselves and so
[1:12:18] notice this is our words and I Endure
[1:12:23] but for a little time
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:28] now it's enduring for a little time okay
[1:12:34] no no he that endureth unto the end
[1:12:38] how many believes God is looking for
[1:12:39] those who endure all the way to the end
[1:12:46] words when Affliction and persecution
[1:12:48] arises for the word sake immediately
[1:12:50] they are offended there's two groups
[1:12:53] that I want to talk about and that is
[1:12:54] this group here a man who had no ground
[1:12:58] didn't have enough ground they had a
[1:12:59] little bit of ground and they come to
[1:13:01] church and say praise the Lord I believe
[1:13:03] that amen hallelujah give my heart to
[1:13:05] God
[1:13:06] Rejoice for a while
[1:13:10] they run the house they scream they
[1:13:13] shout they're on fire
[1:13:17] but by and by
[1:13:22] stefire on the dwindle
[1:13:24] the fire go down
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:29] wouldn't it be nice if God just had us
[1:13:31] on the Mountaintop all the time
[1:13:36] but you know what we'd be if God did
[1:13:37] that we'd be a bunch of jellyfish
[1:13:43] what do you think about I think about
[1:13:44] when I think about uh a steadfastness
[1:13:47] when I think about both sure and
[1:13:50] steadfast I think about roots
[1:13:54] how many knows that that's why I read
[1:13:56] that first scripture you know that we
[1:13:57] have him amen his word him in it is both
[1:14:00] sure and steadfast
[1:14:03] somebody that endures they made an
[1:14:06] Affliction whatever opposition comes
[1:14:09] they endure without giving way
[1:14:16] Hallelujah
[1:14:18] think about it I think about a tree
[1:14:22] that's planted by the rivers of water
[1:14:27] I think about these trees when winds
[1:14:29] come is that right
[1:14:31] I think about these blown over trees
[1:14:33] sometimes many many Big Dreams but other
[1:14:35] trees they don't aren't blown over
[1:14:38] well and it has to do with the root
[1:14:40] system
[1:14:43] folks I'm not talking about that
[1:14:47] please I'm talking about you
[1:14:49] hey man why do we why are you not blowed
[1:14:51] over I'm here to tell you it's because
[1:14:53] of your own system
[1:14:56] it's because of that there's roots that
[1:14:58] has went way down here they've been
[1:14:59] planted by the water you've been giving
[1:15:02] lots of water a minute the trees have
[1:15:04] been a little one come by amen and it
[1:15:06] might pulls you up but guess what it
[1:15:07] causes that rooting to go deeper to go
[1:15:09] deeper and deeper
[1:15:11] those Pharisees those scribes they
[1:15:14] thought that they had Deep Roots they
[1:15:15] went all the way back to Abraham amen
[1:15:17] Moses with their Prophet but Jesus said
[1:15:19] amen you're of your father the devil you
[1:15:21] haven't got a deep enough amen I want
[1:15:24] you to know tonight how many gods and we
[1:15:25] don't go back to Abraham we don't go
[1:15:27] back to that we go all the way back
[1:15:32] by the god before the foundation holds
[1:15:35] you
[1:15:36] did your name is in the book
[1:15:47] Nation
[1:15:49] laughs
[1:15:52] my mouth
[1:15:54] if that don't do something to you I
[1:15:57] don't know I will
[1:15:58] to think that root systems in your heart
[1:16:03] we're not a bunch of jellyfish
[1:16:06] let me know you get a bigger law you get
[1:16:08] a jellyfish out and hold it up here hey
[1:16:10] man you drop it
[1:16:13] what's gonna do five foot
[1:16:15] and you'll have a five foot splatter
[1:16:19] but you take a dog oh
[1:16:25] you think that wrecks we can be thrown
[1:16:27] around
[1:16:28] we can fall we can jump we can do all
[1:16:31] new things right but we still survive
[1:16:37] if you kill some something with a
[1:16:39] backbone
[1:16:40] how many at least we need to have
[1:16:41] backbone
[1:16:43] that's where our strength comes from and
[1:16:45] our backbone amen is right here
[1:16:48] not a jellyfish
[1:16:50] oh my
[1:16:52] but you gotta have
[1:16:54] a root system
[1:16:56] I like that I thought about that
[1:16:58] that's right
[1:17:00] those Pharisees thought you know if we
[1:17:02] have Abraham as our father
[1:17:04] Jesus said ain't gonna cut it
[1:17:06] not good enough
[1:17:08] and they could no doubt Trace their
[1:17:10] lineage back to Abraham I'm of the tribe
[1:17:12] of Levi I'm trying to rub and I'm tired
[1:17:14] of this out of the other
[1:17:15] but he needs to go further than that
[1:17:17] didn't it needs to go further than that
[1:17:20] praise the Lord
[1:17:23] Hallelujah
[1:17:25] let's look at something for just a
[1:17:26] minute
[1:17:27] over in James
[1:17:28] he said take my brethren James 5 and
[1:17:31] verse 10 take my brethren the prophets
[1:17:34] who have spoken in the name of the Lord
[1:17:37] for an example
[1:17:40] of suffering Affliction and of patience
[1:17:45] how many knows
[1:17:46] endurance and patience go hand in hand
[1:17:51] oh my Hallelujah
[1:18:03] remember what we read early
[1:18:05] and so
[1:18:08] after God's War by himself saying surely
[1:18:11] I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will
[1:18:12] pull up must have multiplied thee so
[1:18:14] after Abraham had patience definitely
[1:18:18] endured
[1:18:21] life isn't always about easy sometimes
[1:18:23] it's about endurance young people that's
[1:18:27] the way it is in a marriage she can be
[1:18:28] in church it can no matter where you are
[1:18:30] your job sometimes it takes endurance
[1:18:34] and Abraham had to have endurance
[1:18:37] after he had patiently endured he
[1:18:41] obtained the promise
[1:18:46] I think about it I think about after we
[1:18:49] have patiently endured after we have
[1:18:52] been patient on God folks I know people
[1:18:55] in this message said they're raptured
[1:18:57] done
[1:18:58] took place they said the
[1:19:02] sure the Lord came in the spirits in the
[1:19:04] form of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:06] but what did Brother bam say
[1:19:08] I think Perugia people were were
[1:19:11] but
[1:19:13] they don't even look for his Carnival
[1:19:16] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:18] huh
[1:19:19] literal Return of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:22] these same people of course they didn't
[1:19:24] need a pastor anymore brother but better
[1:19:25] Tommy they had come to perfection
[1:19:28] see that perfect love when you got that
[1:19:30] perfect love you have to that one that
[1:19:31] which is perfect this calm then that
[1:19:33] would just farted and gotten away with
[1:19:36] but we got that boy found out they
[1:19:38] weren't so perfect
[1:19:40] they're out in the world scattered today
[1:19:42] folks
[1:19:43] no words to be found you get off the
[1:19:45] word a little bit folks and it ain't
[1:19:47] long you're way off that's why I believe
[1:19:49] any manager and myself we have to stick
[1:19:51] with that we'll say right there with
[1:19:53] that word when you leave that word
[1:19:57] everything we preach everything it's got
[1:19:59] to be lined up with that word because
[1:20:00] when you leave that there's no telling
[1:20:02] how far you'll go but anyway let me
[1:20:04] finish this scripture so now notice
[1:20:06] he says
[1:20:08] our example of suffering Affliction and
[1:20:12] of patience
[1:20:14] in this something how
[1:20:16] James here mentions behold we count them
[1:20:19] happy which endure
[1:20:22] you have heard of the patience of Job
[1:20:26] amen and we have seen the end of the
[1:20:29] Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and
[1:20:32] of tender mercy so now here they
[1:20:34] mentioned job
[1:20:37] as suffering Affliction I mean no job
[1:20:40] well he endured
[1:20:45] I I want to try to grasp it really and I
[1:20:49] don't think I can
[1:20:50] I don't think any of us really can
[1:20:52] having nine beautiful children that love
[1:20:54] the Lord
[1:20:56] having sheep knocks and have everything
[1:20:57] you can possibly imagine
[1:20:59] everything God's blessed him knowing
[1:21:02] that that we didn't get it through
[1:21:04] deceit
[1:21:06] he didn't steal and Rob to get ready no
[1:21:08] it was all God's blessing everything
[1:21:10] yeah and he offered God sacrifices every
[1:21:12] day he'd make sure everything was right
[1:21:19] huh just in case
[1:21:21] it's wrong or I'm offering a special
[1:21:23] sacrifice forgive him keep them all
[1:21:25] undercover blood and then for all of
[1:21:28] that
[1:21:28] happening all of his children
[1:21:32] dying
[1:21:33] on about a six o'clock news com a
[1:21:37] messenger comes in and he tells them all
[1:21:38] these things I think it was
[1:21:40] different Messengers that came in and
[1:21:42] told him this also happened that also
[1:21:44] happened that also happened that also
[1:21:46] happened
[1:21:47] huh
[1:21:49] and he worshiped job actually worship
[1:21:52] you talk about the patience of Job you
[1:21:54] talk about it wasn't joyful
[1:21:58] I mean sometimes you know Christian walk
[1:22:00] it isn't Joy it's sorrow
[1:22:02] it's sad
[1:22:05] you never lose that peace and that love
[1:22:07] for God but you still experience a
[1:22:10] sadness
[1:22:11] and you have to endure just kind of push
[1:22:13] through it just keep going
[1:22:16] how many is with me
[1:22:18] let me knows what it's like to have it
[1:22:19] go through life and come to the places
[1:22:21] where you really you just you know
[1:22:23] you're just keeping on going
[1:22:25] not that you hate the Lord or not want
[1:22:27] to serve God I don't believe we want to
[1:22:28] do that but it's just that it's so hard
[1:22:30] the road gets long
[1:22:33] your own gets hard and
[1:22:36] people forsake you friends forsake you
[1:22:39] huh
[1:22:41] yeah that's right
[1:22:42] it will get long and hard and gets
[1:22:44] lonely and you just have to endure
[1:22:47] amen that's the way it was with job he
[1:22:49] had to just endure
[1:22:51] and guess what after he passed that test
[1:22:54] he worshiped the Lord said the Bible
[1:22:56] says he worshiped God saying the lord
[1:22:59] gave the Lord taken away blessed be the
[1:23:02] name of the Lord
[1:23:05] job had endurance
[1:23:10] then the Devil Comes again read the next
[1:23:13] chapter whatever comes again says have
[1:23:15] you considered my job yeah all that a
[1:23:17] man has you'll give and so forth but
[1:23:19] touch his body and then it'll be a
[1:23:20] different story God says all right touch
[1:23:22] his body the only thing you can't do is
[1:23:24] kill him
[1:23:25] everything can we say something
[1:23:28] everything but kill him you can do a lot
[1:23:30] all except don't quite kill him
[1:23:34] just about kill him but not quite kill
[1:23:36] him
[1:23:39] he cursed the day he was born let the
[1:23:41] moose
[1:23:41] this Moon not shine to sign that shine
[1:23:44] and all these uh oh he just popped the
[1:23:46] job and on and on and on it was sad
[1:23:49] it was so miserable boils all over him
[1:23:52] sitting on ash Heap on the pit of misery
[1:23:56] God's greatest man on the Earth
[1:24:00] in that kind of misery
[1:24:04] I mean it was it
[1:24:06] endurance
[1:24:10] patience
[1:24:12] patience people aren't patient people
[1:24:15] don't endure
[1:24:17] but he did
[1:24:21] and then I find you know if they're
[1:24:24] going to be in that condition that to be
[1:24:25] better for him to just to go to a better
[1:24:28] place
[1:24:33] well she
[1:24:35] didn't want to see him suffer you've
[1:24:38] been suffering
[1:24:39] I don't know
[1:24:40] we have no word oh this is Africa the
[1:24:43] ending you have no hope you had
[1:24:46] everything's coming out of it
[1:24:49] why don't you just go ahead and curse
[1:24:51] God and die
[1:24:56] that I think about the thing that God
[1:25:00] puts inside of you and inside of me
[1:25:03] is that right
[1:25:05] because that was not just job that was
[1:25:07] something that God had seen and placed
[1:25:09] in job
[1:25:10] because the main thing that the devil
[1:25:14] come up to God about was I'll make him
[1:25:17] curse you to your face
[1:25:19] I'm making cushion
[1:25:23] when that woman spoke cursed God or
[1:25:26] something rose up woman I love you but
[1:25:29] you fool you speak like a foolish woman
[1:25:32] huh our speakers like a foolish moment
[1:25:35] the Lord gives the Lord takes away
[1:25:36] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:25:39] amen it's God that's seen that in job
[1:25:41] that's why he took he did God didn't
[1:25:45] take the challenge
[1:25:47] God gave the challenge
[1:25:50] is that right
[1:25:51] Satan come into the congregation God
[1:25:53] says have you considered my servant
[1:25:55] though
[1:25:57] I got something for you to try out
[1:25:59] he instigated the challenge
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:06] where Satan comes in like a flood
[1:26:09] God knows he sets up a standard against
[1:26:12] it
[1:26:13] he knows what's in you
[1:26:15] remember brother Branham brother Branham
[1:26:17] is another example of a prophet who
[1:26:19] impatiently endured in that right
[1:26:22] affliction
[1:26:24] when his wife passed away when his baby
[1:26:26] got passed away and Leonard Brandon was
[1:26:29] begging God to save spare Sharon Rose he
[1:26:32] had done laid hands on many people
[1:26:34] people he knew God was a Healer but he
[1:26:36] wouldn't heal
[1:26:38] oh his baby
[1:26:41] because he didn't go when God said to go
[1:26:43] in the right
[1:26:44] and God was taking him home
[1:26:46] and he wanted God to do it and the devil
[1:26:48] come to him and talked to him and said
[1:26:50] you know you know he don't love you and
[1:26:51] why are you can you serve a God Like
[1:26:54] That
[1:26:54] he could never
[1:26:56] say that there wasn't a God or a
[1:26:58] deceited him in that lesson brother Ben
[1:27:00] was
[1:27:01] just about to say something
[1:27:04] is that right he was thinking he tells
[1:27:06] us on the book what he thought
[1:27:08] if God's gonna be like that that's how
[1:27:11] God's going to be
[1:27:13] but he says no Devil he's just get thee
[1:27:15] behind me hello and he said the lord
[1:27:17] gave the Lord taken away blessed be the
[1:27:21] name of the Lord
[1:27:22] later on somebody come up and ask him
[1:27:24] brother bad I'm sure all of that did you
[1:27:26] hold your religion
[1:27:29] did you hold you
[1:27:32] what did he say
[1:27:34] no no
[1:27:35] I did that but he held me how many
[1:27:41] blades he endurance that you have it's
[1:27:43] not you it's God put that endurance in
[1:27:46] you
[1:27:50] thank you God for endurance
[1:27:54] this world foreign
[1:27:59] enduring this world to come your way
[1:28:04] endurance
[1:28:07] because
[1:28:09] your root
[1:28:10] Boutique
[1:28:12] go deep how many of these are roots go
[1:28:14] deep
[1:28:15] they go all the way back I believe is
[1:28:17] Paul said one playing dead we are
[1:28:19] planted in Christ
[1:28:22] we're planted
[1:28:24] in Christ
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:28] you have seen
[1:28:30] the end of the Lord
[1:28:34] now turn with me if you will
[1:28:38] to Hebrews again
[1:28:40] let's look at the Lord for a minute
[1:28:45] let's look at the Lord
[1:28:51] Hebrews 12 verse 1 wherefore
[1:28:54] see we are compassed about we're so
[1:28:57] great a cloud of witnesses
[1:29:00] can we stop there for a minute
[1:29:02] don't keep reading
[1:29:04] we're compassed about with a great cloud
[1:29:06] of witnesses
[1:29:11] what was that such
[1:29:13] there's those around of us that are
[1:29:15] saying you can make it
[1:29:18] I mean please those Witnesses saying you
[1:29:20] can go you can do it
[1:29:23] because there's another company of
[1:29:25] witnesses
[1:29:27] that say nah
[1:29:29] can't do it
[1:29:30] I mean not what Israel the spies said
[1:29:33] we're not able to take away we can't do
[1:29:35] it you know how many times that if
[1:29:38] Israel failed to have that endurance
[1:29:41] they failed to have that patience in
[1:29:43] hard times
[1:29:46] they kept wanting to go back to the
[1:29:48] garden
[1:29:49] with the God we were in Egypt at least
[1:29:52] have something to eat wasn't there
[1:29:53] enough graves in Egypt to bury us and
[1:29:55] are we wanting to go back
[1:29:58] Lord help us a real Christian we don't
[1:29:59] want to go back there ain't no going
[1:30:01] back
[1:30:02] it's only going forward
[1:30:06] why we're more than able we have a great
[1:30:08] great company of witnesses all rebel I
[1:30:11] mean Hebrews 11 that we just got
[1:30:13] finished talking about
[1:30:15] uh Ray Urban and then get in and oh
[1:30:20] Abraham and even God himself speaking
[1:30:22] the world into existence and Moses are
[1:30:25] forsaking Egypt and all of those
[1:30:28] all those Witnesses
[1:30:31] amen
[1:30:33] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:30:36] every weight and the sin which
[1:30:38] just so easily beset us and let us run
[1:30:42] with patience to race that is set before
[1:30:45] us
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:48] I heard brother Brown talking about he
[1:30:49] says Lord a little bit of life that I
[1:30:51] have left let me use it for you and I
[1:30:54] thought that's my prayer Lord Jesus what
[1:30:56] life I have left what breath I have left
[1:30:58] what energy I have left Lord let me use
[1:31:01] it to serve you and to bring honor and
[1:31:04] glory to your name
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:10] because time
[1:31:12] is so swiftly fleeting
[1:31:16] amen I didn't read it but rather Branham
[1:31:19] he was when he we talked about something
[1:31:21] of some of these things he talked about
[1:31:22] every 2000 years
[1:31:24] he says something major happens he says
[1:31:26] we got 36 years left
[1:31:31] according to that calendar and he says
[1:31:33] or there would be no flesh saved if you
[1:31:36] don't get saved it doesn't come within
[1:31:37] that time frame which he says we don't
[1:31:39] know when he is coming but according to
[1:31:42] the calendar he said it'll be two
[1:31:44] thousand years and then he says the
[1:31:46] scientists and different ones say that
[1:31:47] our calendar is so far off we're off by
[1:31:49] 17 years
[1:31:50] that we're still already 17 years
[1:31:52] further down the road than what do you
[1:31:54] barely even thinking
[1:31:55] so it's late how many believe that
[1:31:58] let us run the race with patients that
[1:32:00] set before us looking unto Jesus the
[1:32:02] author and the finisher maybe like that
[1:32:05] don't you of our faith praise be to God
[1:32:09] aren't you glad that it's he that
[1:32:12] started this race for you
[1:32:13] and that it's him that gives you the
[1:32:16] endurance to keep on going
[1:32:21] my that just makes me want to run around
[1:32:25] through every Fire Patch through every
[1:32:27] trial through every test because God
[1:32:29] knows his world amenities race and this
[1:32:31] that we're running amen he's got
[1:32:33] mountains it's got balance it's got long
[1:32:35] deserts
[1:32:37] folks it's easy to serve God when you're
[1:32:39] on the Mountaintop don't need endurance
[1:32:41] but when you get down in them long
[1:32:45] valleys

[1:32:48] have like about a 10-year Valley 10

[1:33:00] God do that
[1:33:02] he gives you little trials to build your
[1:33:04] endurance then he gives you a little
[1:33:06] longer trials to give you more endurance
[1:33:08] then he gives you greater trials to give
[1:33:11] you more endurance
[1:33:13] I'm here to tell you with God you can go
[1:33:16] through anything
[1:33:18] there ain't nothing you can't go through
[1:33:19] if you have God
[1:33:25] can I say something else

[1:33:34] thing to show up right

[1:33:56] know him that lays or has our future in
[1:33:58] his hands
[1:34:00] praise be to God
[1:34:01] okay now looking unto Jesus the author
[1:34:04] and the finisher of our faith who for
[1:34:07] the joy that was set down before him
[1:34:11] enjoy going to the cross
[1:34:15] no it was the hardest thing he ever did
[1:34:19] because he was human I mean as he was
[1:34:22] human
[1:34:24] death was not something that he wanted
[1:34:26] to do
[1:34:30] not favorable to the flesh say you say
[1:34:33] that's exactly right because he said
[1:34:35] Lord father if it be possible
[1:34:39] that this could pass from me
[1:34:43] that was the flesh
[1:34:45] then the spirit spoke and said
[1:34:47] nevertheless not my will
[1:34:50] but thine be done
[1:34:52] I believe brother Brown said the
[1:34:54] greatest battle that he ever fought is
[1:34:55] the greatest battle was in The Garden of
[1:34:57] Gethsemane
[1:34:59] between himself his will
[1:35:02] and God's will
[1:35:04] let me tell you something I'm going to
[1:35:05] do this that's where all of our greatest
[1:35:07] battle is right there
[1:35:08] between your will
[1:35:10] or is it going to be God's will that's
[1:35:12] the battle right there and it was a
[1:35:14] battle with him
[1:35:15] he endured the cross
[1:35:19] I've just like brother Benham he had he
[1:35:22] had to come down to the place where he's
[1:35:24] either gonna reject God and say no I
[1:35:26] ain't doing this no more God you took my
[1:35:28] wife and baby I quit I'm done
[1:35:31] huh
[1:35:32] or he's going to say the lord gave the
[1:35:36] Lord taken away blessed be the name of
[1:35:38] the Lord
[1:35:39] and brother bran said every child of God
[1:35:42] comes down to that place
[1:35:44] God will take you all the way to the
[1:35:47] bottom
[1:35:49] amen he'll take you right to that place
[1:35:51] to where he'll either have
[1:35:54] that that he placed in there
[1:35:57] or you won't have it
[1:36:00] amen and I Think Jesus gave a perfect
[1:36:02] example of people that you know go for a
[1:36:05] while but and by and by they're offended
[1:36:08] I'm by they're gone
[1:36:16] all right
[1:36:18] so now notice
[1:36:19] endure the cross despising the shame it
[1:36:24] wasn't didn't enjoy being stripped of
[1:36:26] all of his clothes totally humiliated
[1:36:30] totally humbled
[1:36:34] I mean all of his disciples every one of
[1:36:36] them forsook him
[1:36:38] the offersook him
[1:36:42] Peter
[1:36:43] remember he says I'll never forsake you
[1:36:45] I'll never you know they'll never
[1:36:48] take you out and Jesus says before the
[1:36:50] cockroached you'll deny me Thrice
[1:36:54] Peter didn't have a deep root system did
[1:36:56] he
[1:36:58] he didn't have a very deep root system
[1:37:05] why
[1:37:07] because he wasn't born again
[1:37:10] now let me ask you this how many knows
[1:37:12] that anybody that's not born again is
[1:37:14] not got a very deep root system
[1:37:17] not until you're born again
[1:37:19] when you're born again of the spirit of
[1:37:22] God planted in Christ Jesus you have
[1:37:25] become a part of almighty God then
[1:37:27] you've got a deep deep root system so
[1:37:31] much so that Peter when they got to
[1:37:33] crucifying him isn't that right
[1:37:36] he says don't crucify me up right like
[1:37:38] it did the Lord
[1:37:40] I'm not worthy to be killed the way that
[1:37:43] he was hang me upside down
[1:37:46] huh
[1:37:48] that's right he had a deep root system
[1:37:50] amen now
[1:37:52] all right now notice
[1:37:59] endure the cross despising the shame and
[1:38:02] it set down at the right hand of the
[1:38:04] Throne of God for consider him that
[1:38:06] endured
[1:38:08] such contradiction of Sinners against
[1:38:11] himself least he be weary
[1:38:15] and faint in your minds
[1:38:19] how many believes that's what happens
[1:38:21] with people
[1:38:22] too many people are fainting to passing
[1:38:24] out
[1:38:26] can't go on anymore
[1:38:27] just can't go on anymore
[1:38:29] just can't go on anymore
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:33] how many of us will come to that place
[1:38:35] where boy we just don't know if we can
[1:38:37] keep on going
[1:38:40] huh
[1:38:41] but then
[1:38:42] something happens isn't that right
[1:38:45] Give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord
[1:38:47] thank you for that something that
[1:38:48] happens
[1:38:50] and to get back up
[1:38:53] okay
[1:38:54] you have to keep on going because
[1:38:56] there's something in here God has
[1:38:57] planted and it's called predestination
[1:38:59] it's called election it's called being a
[1:39:02] child of God how many believes that our
[1:39:05] genetics you have to be a gene seed of
[1:39:07] God brother bran said
[1:39:09] folks we are not tied to some Earthly
[1:39:11] man we are tied to the master himself
[1:39:14] our genetics go right back to his
[1:39:16] genetics we have we are bone of his bone
[1:39:19] flesh of his flesh Gene of his Gene but
[1:39:22] the band says if you're not a gene of
[1:39:24] God you'll never come to it amen you'll
[1:39:27] never unless you are a seed Gene of
[1:39:30] almighty God
