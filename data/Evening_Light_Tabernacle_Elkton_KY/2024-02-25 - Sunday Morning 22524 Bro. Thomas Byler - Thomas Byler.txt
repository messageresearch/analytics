doing missionary work and so forth and if you can't go send somebody amen personally I still feel like we uh spend on money on a lot of things and I don't think we put enough into missionary amen so I want to try to at least take another two uh maybe another couple offerings up this year if that be all right amen for for sending somebody and but John Wade found somebody that he has a lot of confidence in that actually is going from town to town taking message books amen putting it on tables out into also going to pastors denominational pastors and so forth and reaching out and having

something like that amen that about right all right that brother so that's who we're going to uh get that to so that's where that will go amen so what let's just have a word of prayer I do want to say before you know before I before we do last year has been a good year amen how many believe it's been a good year amen and by God's grace we got the building paid for and soth and uh that was that was a big miracle really amen amen so we appreciate the way that things went as far as offices and everything I'm happy with everything I think everybody's doing a good job amen and that's on my behalf you know but everybody has a vote so if you don't like something or whatever you have a vote coming but amen I like when things run smooth amen praise the Lord and I think they are pretty much and we

want to make some changes for bettering uh bettering things here amen and you know but we're going to do it with the help of the Lord just as we get the money to do it we don't want to take up a loan

church in order Lord Jesus and each office Lord father we know that each year we vote on each office Lord and we take the majority of the people's vote as being the voice of God as he has said Lord

to you real lives in God that we'll give an account of how we use and how we do serve in these offices Lord Jesus and we'll also be rewarded according to how we do these things Lord and being a pastor realize father it's more responsibility than any other God and I just pray that you would help me always Lord to do the right thing to be led by the Holy Spirit God to be yielded to you in such a way that you can have your way father and and bringing your people to where we should be father so bless each one now as father we go on paper Lord and cast our votes Lord in Jesus name amen we're going

come and share that testimony get us all fired up this morning amen God bless you brother Tom there you go after that we'll do to I'll turn it over to Brother David how yall doing that's what y'all come do Glory praise the Lord oh man I've been so fired up on the way here I'm about to bust at the scen man I was on the way here and the Lord just started ministering to my heart you know I was like thinking about this message this message of the hour ain't just painting that's it's become a reality you know Alpha and Omega becoming one becoming a reality you know burning within us you know oh man it just had me so fired up I was about busting out right here I was like so it's kept me thinking about I just heard a song other day this guy was talking about uh uh when we get over in heaven he said uh angels are going to be bound their head yeah you can hear I'm some I'm so pumped up I'm telling you what praise the Lord but uh uh he said uh you know when we get over in heaven he said the angels are going to be bwing their head well they don't know how to sing Amazing Grace that's right he he said he said it's kind of like around here he said some some of the people when it's uh oh I got Victory in Jesus Victory or Victory in Jesus yeah we can have something to praise and Shout about you know I say you know today we can be free today in Christ Jesus you know it has me all way fired up you know I was just thinking about re revisiting why I'm fired up you know when God visited me in prison in a in a real prison and set me free he set me free then he set me free from drugs and alcohol cigarettes toaca you name it he set me free but then I was still caged up in just a a mindset of going through the motions and living a life you know no Victory no just half-hazard Christian Life what I like to say but when he took down them walls and let me be free in Christ I can be free and Shout Jesus cuz I love the Lord Jesus blessed be his name he broke that for me that's what he's done for me you know so it's got me all way fired up this morning because you know what I was just thinking I don't remember what all I shared when I come back from the prison ministry but it just inspired me so much that that I felt more at home there witnessing to them guys because they was hungry and thirsty for something you know and so when I was there you know it just inspired me it just felt more natural being there with them them guys and uh uh by God's grace y'all just keep praying for me uh uh we got my own thing going now we're trying to get going we're about to be cleared by God's grace we're going to we got all of our names cleared all the brothers are going to be with me here I got Brothers all the way up to Missouri coming with me but you know I believe it's just God on the Move we're going to try to reach out and do something you know Walking With Jesus Outreach so it's God I just pray that you just pray that everybody we come in contact with even between now and then that we can be a living witness it ain't a painted fires power and demonstration of the word become real it just gets me all the way fired up I can't even help it but yeah I just keep on praying but you know I just been seeing God work in miraculous ways you know uh I had so many little notes I could have probably just winged it but I was afraid I'd leave something out here but you know I seen God working in all things working all things together down to the smallest detail of you know being with my wife that led me to you know meeting her uncle that led me to a prison ministry in Florida you know they have me the hookups there you know I was down there I I had a bunch of ministers we was going to we was going to hang out and I was like you know I can took all kinds of books you know of the message of that I'm like okay tonight I'm G to share the message with all these guys we're doing a big Bible study and I kept seeking the Lord and praying about it you know because I didn't you know how many times we can share the message and be out of timing you know so I want the Lord's will and I was praying and uh my devotional that day said uh brother brand said sometimes I just keep my Doctrine to myself and and uh you know uh uh just stick with the word because it can kind of uh hurt your uh uh influence yeah and so I was like I just took it as the Lord's will okay we're not going to share the message so I went on anyway you know and what was crazy here's God working the prison that we was going to every day for like four days straight got locked down completely on Max lockdown so we couldn't go there no more and all the brothers I was with like you know God's doing something we don't know if he was saving our life from killing us or you know or something or moving us to touch somebody else's life well you know what I believe is I bumped into this brother that after being diverted over there I'm talking to him and I get to share my story with these guys and you know and during the worship service we just you know the spirit of the Lord just started moving it was awesome and and he came to me later was talking to me and he started feeling he started talking about man I just want to be fired up like you you know he talking about how uh uh uh uh he ain't getting fed at his church and this and that you know so I be I began to just I started feeling I could see a thirst in him you know and and and as this has been going on I've been talking to this brother ever since then this has been months and months and months ago now and we've been talking and getting fired up together and it's just been laying on heavy on my heart because last week I was with a brother of mine and we were sharing and and when you start seeing you know it made me think about souls that are in prison you don't have to be in prison to be in prison you know we can be in prison in this body we can be you a man-made prison a self-made prison you name it we can be in prison so I just got to thinking on that and and I was going back and forth debating with one of my buddies you know and we're going to the scripture and it's like they can't see nothing but blessed be the name of the Lord we can see and so when I see when I see these people bound up by denominational systems bound up by religious uh you know ideology that they they're so smart that they work their way right out of it you know and and being a brother you know going way back you know it's just saddening to me you know what I'm saying because you want to see him free in Christ like we are and so so the more I I witnessed to my buddy see he he the reason why I'm sharing a lot of this is because as we've been talking he's been growing and he was talking about the scales just falling off of his eyes he lives off all the way up at the tip top of mouri right by Iowa he's 20 years old married Little Couple and just on fire for God but he's bound up by minight traditions and now God's been opening his eyes and he's ready to be free I told him he was an eagle all along I told him there was something the Deep call the deep and and now that it's just been becoming more real to this brother becoming more real and so he's going to come down and spend a weekend with us you know weekend after next the painting weekend and all that and we're all going to fellowship and everything and so I've just been mentoring him and as we've been sharing The Sword and and and and and he's been carried and yielding that sword you know you get stronger if you went to battle picked up a heavy sword you to use it because it's going to wear you down but when you use it all the time it becomes a reality and it's it's God in us becoming flesh blessed be the name of the Lord so it just gets me fired up to see him and and I've been watching him grow so when him he said the other day yesterday he was telling me about his dad coming over there and they get to talk and he's like you know cuz they've been telling him why don't you cuz he's like you know he got caught up and he's like if you got prove it scripturally he's just showing it's a manm tradition that's your ideology he's like you know his dad and they come say oh I'm afraid you're going to lose your salvation he said I can't lose my salvation that's your man's idea he said I I'm basing it on the word and he started using it he said I went away from there just feeling so so good because he said I even went back to the scripture and make sure I was right they went back and forth like two hours I said that's what I like to hear because you know you want to know where you stand on the word but now that you've been using it you know and I said you know I believe he could even be a witness to his own uh family you know but but seeing it but seeing him grow you know it's just so awesome because you know uh as he's wanting to be free that's that deep call of the deep but he's entertaining on coming down this way and uh so I just think it'd be such a blessing for all of us just to you know really welcome him and you know there bunch of young couples you know they going to be excited to see him you know and I had another little testimony I had answered a phone call the other day that uh the doctors have been texting me and emailing me and constantly calling me and trying to get me to set up a you know I kept praying the Lord you know I had something in my mind that if if it goes this way we'll do it you know I I've been ignoring the cause and I thought it might have been a the Trust Company calling me so I answered the call and then she told me who she was okay yeah yeah I let her go on and say everything and uh and you know because I said I always thought you know what I don't know it could be uh a a box of rattlesnakes it could be something trying to put fear and doubt in my mind I don't know but I told her ma'am I said well I just want to tell you by God's grace he's healed me I said there won't be no more needing for setting up any other appointments for me I I won't need no more visits and and she just shouted she said pray the Lord you know something just stirred in her heart because you know what I I'm Healed I don't need to look back I don't need a Vindication the Vindication is Christ in me living through me why am I gonna go look back what if he says you still up you still got a terror I don't care what you say I don't have a terror I told her I'm 100% whole and I'm doing everything they said I couldn't do because God Is A Healer but you know it's just like as we see we want is uh you know see the and my conclusion is this is I just been sharing with people friends people that I've been inviting I was like you know I've seen the transformation to me over the past year of my church body you know how how inspiring it is to see it start growing as a family and start seeing the spirit of the Lord move in unity and in power you know when he comes down in the midst of us and we welcome his presence we invite him to come down into our hearts and speak to each one of us each and every time we come and as we do this it's just it's just been so inspiring to me to even share that with brothers and sisters that God is on the Move he's ready to get us ready to get on out of here so as we become it one even together as a little body a little assembly you know I'll tell the Lord all the time I'm like it's fine and dandy all these things big churches are doing but what about our little body Lord we want our little body to have everything they because we're just as much as them as they are of us bless it be the name of the Lord so it just got me uh but what even more fires me up and I I'll get off the stage here but what gets me the most fired up is when I go witnessing to brothers and sisters and things and and you see them Bound by denominational systems you see them bound up in addictions you see them bound up in their self you see them bound up in everything even to to think they just going to live life and go through the motions but when we can come in here and praise God freely we can praise him with a shout we can praise him with a song we can praise him on the work because we know we're following the real Vindicated truth that is such a blessing for us and it gives each one of us something to shout about we ought to be so fired up that we don't want to be them Angels clothing thereo clothing we are to just be shouting to the hilltop because we're free we're free people right now every promise in the book is mine blessed be the name of the Lord so God bless you we're free amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord enjoyed that testimony this morning I did have one announcement I forgot brother John amen we'd like to have a get together next Saturday amen at uh back here back of the building here and so forth we got uh we're going to have volleyball just basically a little get

last sermons that he preached he preached a message called The Rapture and he used his scripture the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble shall he hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now mine head now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of of Joy amen I will sing yay I will sing praises unto God amen amen I'm GNA read another one in 1 Corinthians 3 and 16 1 Corinthians 3 and 16 we're going to be ministering and touching on one of the great Mysteries of the whole Bible amen one of the greatest Mysteries of the whole Bible amen and it's something that around the message preachers have preached on Amen time and time again amen but we don't know just how which way the Lord will go with it but we'll just trust him in it amen that if something will be said that'll be a blessing to you amen verse 16 of chap first 1 Corinthians chapter 3:16 no not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroyed for the temple of God is Holy which Temple are ye may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated I did not intend to read it in that way amen when I first came up here but I thought that with uh the last verse of the 27th chapter Psalms I thought it went along with it because I did intend to read that at some point in time the last verse which is verse six it says and now shall mine head be lifted above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord amen I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his courts with praise amen singing this is the day that the Lord has made we will rejoice amen how many believes that you are the Temple of Holy Ghost we are the Temple of almighty God it it's not this building that's the temple but it's you that's the temple amen and that's what we're going to speak on the greatest mystry talk about Christ being in you amen this is a mystery that has been hid from ages and times but made known to us I believe more so than ever amen amen I don't know we'll just go according to the Lord and we uh don't want to set it time anybody in a hurry today got anywhere to be amen I heard brother Tim PR last week said we only have one service on Sunday he says he calls a joining to two together amen that's what I call it amen joining the two together amen take your time in the morning amen and call it a day amen so I think there ain't nothing wrong with that but amen so we'll just take our time and we'll just see what the Lord will have for us I'm sure that you have been praying I know that you have been praying amen for the service this morning amen that God will just speak to our hearts amen aren't you glad that Jesus Christ is with us even in US amen that we have a Living God on the inside that you are God's Temple amen praise the Lord much could be said things that I wouldn't be have enough wisdom to go into but we know that in the days of Solomon you know Solomon built the temple of God and it was a magnificent thing amen even so much until I think it the disciples marveled at it and said you know told Jesus look at how great this Temple is and so forth amen because it must have been prestigious or some a really great work of art amen and it had to build be a certain way build a certain way you know and so forth amen for God to come and to bring his glory and his person down into it amen and I believe that for God to come and in Tabernacle himself in you you have have to be built a certain way amen God just don't come in anybody's Temple amen amen and so praise the Lord now I'm going to go all the way back to the bag of my my notes and I just want to read one scripture I told you I had thought I wanted to maybe preach on this sometime and I just couldn't seem to get away with it get get away from it amen but uh a quotation that brother Brandon made about amen a church amen he makes this St he says the beauty of the church is the character of the people amen and that's what I want to preach on the beauty of the church amen would that be okay this morning praise the Lord now here we find in Psalms 27 amen David talking of course and we won't into go get into something that some of that that where he's talking about why brother Bandon would read that certain scripture for a Rapture message we know the Rapture of course in second second Thessalonians there I believe it is where it says you know we which are alive and remain you know that would be your normal raptured topic isin that right but he took this I mean to speak on it you know and I can't help but to think but you know verse five he talks about that in a time of trouble he will hide me in his Pavilion how many believe that truly does fit the mold of where you and are living today it is a time of trouble amen in a time of trouble and I'm telling you right now you know people don't know trouble yet we're living in an age of of sinfulness debauchery and and things that make you just sick to think that Humanity could stoop to such lows how many knows in the days of Noah Humanity stepped to stooped into such lows until it grieve God that he ever made man I can't help but you and I feel the same way my my my you know it Grieves you to think that Humanity could become so debot until they don't know who they are anymore that that they would have Fierce arguments about how many genders there are amen and so forth but you know I'm so glad that in this hour amen that oh he has left us a word he has left us and escaped he has given us a pavilion he has given us a place of Refuge amen and that is in him oh my that's right oh my a time of trouble he will hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock oh my them folks people just mind they go from one thing to another to another there's no sure Foundation out there but you and I have been set upon a rock God said so so that settles it amen and you ain't got to worry about it praise be to God when we think about the beauty of the church now notice the beauty of the church because you know we've been trying to update upgrade the church a little bit amen I got to thinking about just what we're doing in the Tabernacle this this this Tabernacle that we call church so to speak or the building amen and the different things that we're doing Amen to modify or to make it a little better and I thought you know amen if we would do that in our building what about the real temple of God Amen you know there's a lot of things that I left unfinished whenever I put these Corners up and so forth you know just last day few days we put them little caps on and I you have to agree that it just makes it look a lot better just finishes it you know I thought Lord Jesus I wonder how many of us sit in the PS amen about half done amen just don't have the finishing touches yet because until something's done and I'm sure that every lot a lot of us have am unfinished how many unfinished jobs honey do lists yeah I got honey do list and then I got Thomas do lists then I got other lists you know I got more lists than I can list always something to do amen something good man think a job to finish I got a project on the back of my barn I got a job on the side of I got another side of my barn I got something beside the barn something beside the barn to do hello but you know how many know I believe that's what God that's the way we are amen as a church and God is building something Amen in these trying to get it to completion he's trying to get it done he's trying to get it to Perfection Lord oh my that's right he's trying to get it to Perfection ain't he Sur is you know it says in Ephesians 4 and verse 11 he gave some Apostles and Prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith amen like brother Joe was praying Lord help us help us to be completely unified I hope you're ready for a long sermon completely unified a unified body amen perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry edifying of the body of Christ till we come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man I don't know about you but I like it when I can say that job is done that's the way I imagined it now it's finished I'm satisfied how many knows that they can without us cannot be made perfect they're waiting on you and I to come to Perfection what is that Perfection oh man that's not physical not not that you'll never be sinless but that is coming into full measure of the stature of [Music] Christ my my my that's right praise the Lord things just don't look good half done you don't look good half done huh we don't look God good to God half done right let us think in I wonder how many halfway Christians there is yet halfway message Believers just going to halfway things of God ain't all that important amen I read a quote where brother Raam talked about this was his prayer in a prayer he says Lord he says I pray that you'll send the double portion tonight that it'll be like not that I speak but let the Holy Spirit speak and May in speaking them may great signs and wonders Break Forth and may this whole audience Break Forth for that Living Water springing up like geisers out of the so how many Jesus said to that woman it'll be in you a well of water springing up into everlasting life how many knows that the church and the beauty of the church you can only be beautiful when you get a good PA when you get washed we got to get Washed by the Water of the word the word cleanses us it cleans you amen and there's a well of water coming up from the inside amen and cleaning you seeing therefore that all these things shall be

delivered you from all of the enemies he has delivered you from all of your enemies why shouldn't you have a little Joy that's the beauty that's the beauty of the church beauty isn't the church beauty of the church isn't like the old mmy that came down from the hills to visit one of her daughter and her son-in-law and went to this modern Presbyterian Church I say Presbyterian but and those churches amen she sat in the back preacher comes out now Jesus Christ came into the world to save Sinners amen praise be to God sit back there and everybody what on Earth we heard something like that every

right he came to save me W yeah that's the beauty of God he died on calv took nails and his hands and his feet a spear his side was spit on why shouldn't you rejoice why shouldn't you have happiness he did that so you could have happiness so you could be [Applause] [Music] joyful y' gonna kill me no not really just know this if I die have a heart attack [Music] boom just know this I went happy all right leave me alone I wasn't happy amen I got a quote for that how many believe we have a right to be happy brother Bram says that's the reason these people are so happy that's what makes people the way that they are is because they've entered into the holies of holies they've kind of under that you kind of Glory you come into the beauty of Holiness how many knows that's what God says come and worship me in the beauty of Holiness ain't no church beautiful unless it's got Holiness that means you've been washed from your sin that means you ain't got no judgment coming to you you've already went through the fire you've standing where the fire has already been somebody toss me up a second breath up here I need it about now amen you love him that's right the beauty of the Gospel that's what is so beautiful amen give unto the Lord oh ye Mighty give unto the Lord glory and strength give unto the Lord the glory to his name Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness it's such a beautiful thing when everybody is praying up when they come in when they come in here holy and if you aren't holy guess what this is the place to get holy oh boy here we go down the rabbit Trail but I think it's right where the Lord wants me to go we've got a we sometimes sometimes washing of the water of the word let me just put it this and hope won't be wrong but it says maybe sometimes the hearing the word isn't enough huh you know sometimes whenever I'm doing car get doing a little bit of I think I got a little black right on my finger there yet you know whenever you go do being a grease Monk and you do a little mechanic work you know you don't even have to touch any don't like that grease jumps on you when it gets on your hand it's on your hand and all some I get all up in it amen and I gotta go and I can't just use water it don't get it all does it no and I can use dishw Liquid and it does a little better but if I really want it clean I go get me some gas all right wash it a few times in gas and it'll get it won't get it all but it'll really get it you got to get a chemical and me if you really want those real hard you need the chemical of the blood of Jesus Christ to come and wi away Glory sometimes you got to have it maybe you ain't overcoming maybe youve got to besetting sin maybe you're half done and you really want to get all done something you can't overcome you need the bleach of Jesus Christ you need the chemistry feel the blood to come and wash [Music] you not just claiming the word but you need the chemistry of the blood to wash those real hard stains off you've gone so far and you don't think you can ever go further you can't get past that place that you are you stay in the same place stay in the same place I've concluded that you never stay in the same place because if you stay in the same place you're going backwards CU you're either going forward or you're going backwards amen I me pleas we're going forward I want God to come into my life and he I want him to take those little details that I've left off and I want him to fix it I want him to finish it are you with me God help us to come come now Lord think about what it is in your life think about what it is that's not finished yet huh it's not finished yet God's still working on it the holy spirit is still there you need to get in bathed in the presence of God until that thing don't bother you anymore come into the holies of holies amen and not watch those things will go by the ways side you left pop over your own will you have power over your own flesh one of the beauties of the church is the Dynamics of the church it's not the mechanics it's the Dynamics that's the beauty I don't come to you in word only but I come to you Paul said in power and demonstration of the spirit let me demonstrate to you what God has done can do [Music] the the mechanics aren't so important huh we appreciate all the beauty that God has allowed to have in a church but it wouldn't matter if this was made out of some rusty gold metal right here wrapped in it some up and down metel here and Lacrosse is on the front it wouldn't matter as long as the Dynamics is there as long as the power is there I've got a new revelation for you are you ready brother brand talked about a diamond studed Cadillac is that right oh my the wheels are all polished diamond studed and everything all but I'll take you somewhere else not the diamond studed car but I going to take you to our drag race let's go the drag race for without m we want to do a drag race you know Christians don't go to drag races I guess but anyway drag race where they just you know and these cars some cars they ain't got a lot of metal on the outside they ain't got very much good looks huh they don't look very good but guess what brother red I like them back tires they like that thing man big old back tired right man spendy looking front end but guess what you always ask the question you know well that's a nice looking Camaro but let me look under the hood I mean like to look under the let's look under the hood see what's under the hood amen them cars there riy rackety whatever but I'll tell you when you get in that car buckle up amen and you woo is that right that's right that's the way God wants his church he don't care he want you have power in here that's my new revelation yeah that's about what God wants his children comes at you with a thought the devil you just go on down the road with that's fries left him sitting back at The Beginner's place you done went to the Finish Line how many needs to be there that's right that's why we want to be left him sitting there bring every thought into the Captivity to the word of God Roar and mean let that engine be powerful amen got this nice Lamborghini on the Dr drag racetrack Lamborghini against the little Vega y'all remember the Vega and they're going to compete H and all of a sudden it don't look good it don't look good but guess what the green light flashes on the yellow that green there they go and the B just got to leave that Lamborghini why not because of it was because of what was under the hood and that's the way it is with you and I don't matter what you look like I don't care if you're spending Little David if you're a sham God power under the hood the enemy better watch out David didn't look like much but the glory of God was beautiful it was beautiful I wish I could fall but I better not it was beautiful when David a me took that sling go I felt something where did that thin little come that little blood come out the front of his head a gap that wide in his helmet and it made the Gap I'm sorry I just don't think David was that good sorry David I don't think you were that good they'll have to correct me in heaven but I don't think he was that good I think it was a Divine thing of almighty God he didn't come with a sword and spear but he came by the power of almighty God but B says and that's what you are doing we're basking in the beauty of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the power of the Resurrection oh I can't all things in this world put dong it's so ugly so that I might know the power of the Resurrection how many with me that's what I want to know this 2024 I want to know in the power of his resurrection the beauty of the Resurrection in the church a PR your death on fire don't bring no painted fires into this church don't be fake don't be a Pharisee be real bring up like the fire to the [Applause] church well I didn't expect to preach that hard but I just yielded to him it's not me it's him right this is this is me getting out of the way and let him have his way better bad knows all about it okay I lost both P I'm glad the word is nighty amen the glasses are nighty amen praise the Lord okay it took pressure to make Jesus what he was I think brother Brad a few sermons ago he had actual how much pressure that it takes to make a diamond that right schematics of it and so forth but it takes an immense amount of pressure to create a diamond that's what it took to make Jesus perfect in the way that he was took meal pressure and that Perfection that he had he handed it to you how manyan believe that he gave that to you but he still takes you and I through pressure to bring the beauty of himself out of it brother pH touched on it and I didn't expect to go this way but I will amen let me see you see brother Brandon I'm sitting here waiting for the prayer line in other words people waiting in the prayer line to get healed and he says God's working that just exactly for the good why was it that little precious little boy the other day stricken blind when he was born that guide God might get glory and turn a city upside down I imagine John Ryan turned to place upside down too don't you amen some of those people amen the woman at the well she went to the city and many believed that he was the Messiah because of her testimony amen God knows what he's doing God knows and he puts us on on an as sheep in order to show Glory show his glory to us amen so this morning I say this friends after 31 years of ministry after 31 years of toils on the field I want to make my testimony this I have seen disappointments I have seen time that I've asked for things and cried for things and begged for things and failed to get them but if I'll just wait patiently upon God then I know that it all works just exactly right I think that would be a a quote that we need to put on our hard drive don't you amen you see disappointments heartaches I answer prayer what do you do he said be patient be patient wait on God he knows what he's doing and I know it all works exactly right comes out just exactly right does just exactly the right thing when I lost my baby my Sharon my little Sharon that was the one thing that stumbled me I said how can that be for the good amen don't we get to those places sometimes people die things happen God took brother Bam's little daughter and he took his wife a mama with two young little children God took the baby and he took the mama huh left the dad sitting there wondering what good can this be what good is this so heartbroke till he put the gun to the Head pulled the trigger snap I don't know if you did it more than once wouldn't go off threw it over there and it went off grab power lines because he was in such sorrow because of the hardships that he was going through couldn't do it can't take it hello you say well I've went through things where I thought I might just kill myself no you haven't been as bad as brother brandom nope because he didn't think about that he did it he was so sad so sorrowful he did it he grabbed that power line he pulled that trigger thank you God thank you for protecting him around there thank him for laying him down on the ground thank you Lord for not letting him shoot himself cuz you had a work he had a work for him to do and even though he wanted to take his own life God forbid it amen no oh this is a deep Revelation how many believe that you've got a purpose in God and you ain't gon to go until he's done with you if he cares that much about his prophet he does that with every one of his children amen so we can rest comfortable and be at peace can't we now to no no if he did that for him he also does that for you I know for a fact that God controls your mind he's got control when you lose your control he'll He he'll step in oh he will he's that kind of a God he'll give you thoughts that you wouldn't ordinarily think he'll change your mind about stuff thank you God I wouldn't be standing here probably if it wouldn't have been for the fact that he didn't let that go off you wouldn't be here at this church wouldn't be here none of us would be here it be a whole different [Music] story but can I say something else it couldn't go off because God's word Can't Fail he will not fail he can do anything but fail if people would just realize that about the word of God there would be a Bible in every school we'd be having devotions every morning in the school sisters there we'd be having devotions all right we're going to read a scripture it'd be like at my house with Donna and the granddaughters we have about a half hour or better of good devotions and talking about God and teaching them things amen amen you love him can I go a little long this morning cuz we're at the time now so this is all just a sacrifice to God oh we're about done but anyway now look where we at that's right how can that be for the good how can it be he says and months later when I seen her standing there in all of the beauty of a young girl speaking to me standing by the side of that Old Wagon broke down there see we got it all figured out everything's going to be perfect just going to be be broken down wagons there God knows what he's doing don't don't think he got it all figured out all right amen and I know that if I uh if she would have lived I know if she would have lived she might have turned out wrong God had to take her while she was yet tender and sweet but I know that I'll see her again I know I shall see her I know beyond any shadow of a doubt brother brah talked about seeing his wife and his wife coming back to him and whispering and talking to him ain't that right press on press on quit worrying about me I'm in a good place we think oh God was cruel no you have no idea the place that he put them in they're in a much better place the bad the sad part is is the one that's left here amen that's the saddest part it's not the ones that's gone into heaven amen now I notice I know and I think of my wife of 22 years old taken just marily a girl a little mother there when the papers give the headline there young mother of Reverend just died oh how hard how my heart bled I didn't know what to do but today I know that it was all working for my good but today I know it was all working for my good I know the life had to be ground and twisted and squeezed to get what was in it out of it he says there was too much brandom in there that had to be squeezed out before God could make himself known there and I put is instead of was there is too much you in you how many believe there still too much me in me man if there's people listening hear this Prophet telling there's too much of you if you aren't right into place walkinging with God the way that you should then there is still too much you in you there was too much of brother branam and brother brandom how many knows we all know the story of how much it was amen when those Pentecostal people said come we got got all kinds of invitations to go with the gift of healing and how many could have been saved how many could have been healed in his ministry but because his mother-in-law said don't you take my my daughter out amongst that trash holy roll stuff and I I I don't hardly ever say anything negative about brother bam but it wasn't Hope's fault it was not Hope's fault it was brother bram's fault because hope said I'll go with you I'm with you wasn't Hope's fault so brother brandham overrode his own wife's encouragement to go anyway so there was too much brother brandom in there is that right because we know it was because of his Disobedience God says all [Applause] right yeah even the scripture says that who God uses the most most of the time he puts them through the hardest trials amen but you got to be squeezed out why after that God could reflect himself when bam get up here he was so surrendered to God that whenever that Spirit of Jesus Christ would come on the platform he would yield himself and he'd say you're from so and so your name is from so and so and you have this problem and this out of the other he begin to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart millions of times WHL over ain't that right but says the moment at at the well whenever Jesus said you've had five husbands and the one you have now is not yours she went into the City and a man that has told me everything I've ever did isn't this the Messiah she knew what the Messiah was I mean know we've had the Messiah comeing our day wasn't brother Brandon but through the prophet I manyan know through the body of Christ that's what the church is it's the body of Christ and God is working that's where Love Comes that's where forgiveness comes the beauty of Jesus is in the body of Christ is in the temple of God and God used it in such a way amen until it so fits The Headstone that's why we've had a Ministry so perfect how many believe that this ministry is so perfect until people thought that brother Bandon was Jesus we've had a Min that fits right in a Ministry I will say of perfection so maybe now God's waiting on you you and me amen I believe the prophet said one place he had play believe that he had come to the place of full obedience to God Lord help Thomas piler be able to say that I've come to the place of full Obed I wonder how many listening out there can you say I've come to the place of full obedience you know what I like about being the preacher is the holy spirit will go out there and he'll show you where you're still not where you ought to be you know that area you live you know where that is the holy spirit if you'll pray if you'll just get a little bit of guid in you God will show you where it is if you don't even know most of the times that's what we need for God to come more into our hearts show us where we're not what we ought to be and then let God finish the work and bring us to the place that we should be amen amen too much of you and you till God had to squeeze it through trials and while that squeezing was coming it's hard but after a while the sky is clear back and you see the purpose of God and then you cry I know my redeemer liveth and in the last days he'll stand on the earth though the skin worms destroyed his body yet in my flesh shall I see God these little trials and things are just for a moment and they fade and they pass away but they're only done for your good let us remember that that God would get the glor Amen in closing now brother B preaching Amen on the church and after they had made it very nice and so forth now I think that it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful to God that this will not just be a beautiful building that we come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person that comes here amen when people come they don't see just the beauty of of the church but they see the beauty of the people the character of the people how nice they how gent how sweet how Meek amen how loving that they are amen listen may it be cons a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is and that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people and I trust that he'll always be a house of God of beauty amen can I read you one that we missed we'll read one that we missed and it has to do with brother bandam talking about a flower that has a sweet fragrance a sweet fragrance of a flower amen he says that flower is pretty I love it pretty flower I think of that like I do how pretty the flower is it blooms and it's got fragrance and the passor by smells it and the animals come by and smell it but now look it's pretty like the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the most glorious thing Divine healings Powers wonders signs Miracles freedom from sin it's a beautiful place yes but look if that Rose will have to come list to the church like all nature the rose being pretty he says every cow in the country would lick it on it and so forth if you could and and now Nature has provided little bayonets a little spear sticking out there called Thorns how many knows in every Thorn you know those those wonderful Rose of are thorny so the church is beautiful it's got free grance but it's also a little bit thorny now notice little Spears sticking out there call thorns and they keep they keep them away it protects them that's right Al know I think today if we haven't got the sword of the word sharper than any two-edged sword around the beauty of the power of Holiness of God he said then we're going to let every cow in the country lick it and call it and gum it amen and being in dep in other words amen this sweetness This Love This Joy this fragrance that we have sometimes the preacher has to come out here and say now be careful don't you let the devil shoot you with some kind of poison don't you do this and don't you do that why to keep the evil spirits away from us to keep them from coming in and robbing us of the presence and the beauty of almighty God we need to start sharp two-edged sword to keep them things away amen praise the the Lord stand with me this morning musicians if you come I got a few songs that I'd like to sing that goes along with this real well but first I think it would be appropriate to Bow our heads for each one to search your hearts see where that area is that you know needs adjustment the beauty of church is that the Holy Spirit comes and he shows you where you're wrong shows you where you need adjustment convicts you it's called conviction I guess this is mostly for message that are Christians already but still know that you're still not what you need to be in certain places in your life we all got that weak link that weak Link in the chain so to speak or that weakness whatever it might be could be Pride could be lust could be love of money greed could be jealousy could be envying somebody else could be anything like that do you see it if you see it in your life raise your hands in surrenderance to God say Lord I Surrender it to you right now Lord work on me Father work on me Lord father it may take work it may be hard might cause me to sweat but Lord whatever it takes I want to be the way that you want me to be Lord cuz I want people only to see the reflection of your life in my life I want people to see the beauty of Jesus in me Lord Jesus you see these hands all over the building

take me further Lord because I want to see more of the beauty of Christ in my life for we ask this blessings and favors and believe it with all of our heart forgive Lord we can't go without asking for forgiveness of Lord Jesus of our failures Lord Jesus and we ask the leech of Jesus Christ to come and to wash us white clean and pure Lord Jesus take that little stubborn stain take it away Lord father for you wash every stain away Lord Jesus we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen let the beauty of Jesus be seen me amen amen amen brother John you want me to mention this amen Jonathan
