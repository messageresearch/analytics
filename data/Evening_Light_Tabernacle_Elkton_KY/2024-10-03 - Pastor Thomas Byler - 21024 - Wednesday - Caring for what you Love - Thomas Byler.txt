it's good to be in the house of the Lord trust you're having an awesome week this week so far amen you can't complain about the weather that's for sure amen God is good isn't he amen thank you musicians amen appreciate all amen and all y'all do we don't appreciate you enough amen so thank you very much amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to be a Christian tonight amen so um it's been mentioned I think brother John mentioned it and I know that uh how many know is North Carolina got hit really really bad and uh there's a lot of needs there and it's been brought to me to maybe take up an all love offering for him so I think we'll do that Sunday amen when everybody's here and if we can get any pictures or anything like that and amen most likely we'll probably Channel it through but Donnie and them so because they can take our offering or whatever and make the most of it amen would that be okay amen we hadn't done a missionary offering in a while so this will be our missionary offering amen so we'll plan on doing that Sunday amen because I'll tell you what there there's there's a lot of Devastation amen just can't imagine Ain that right amen and so we just pray for them in a special way that God just help each and every one of them amen let's just bow our heads we'll get right into the service Lord Jesus we come before you again Lord tonight grateful Lord Jesus to be in you amen Lord heed away Lord from the world and from all the hounds and the sounds of the world and and all the dangers and toils and things that that would trap and that would snare and that would destroy that would kill Lord and father to be knowing that our lives are secured back with you father and we thank you for that tonight we ask God for Lord sister Perry in a special way that you would help her Lord Jesus to recover Lord Jesus from this operation she's had father and give her strength for her body once again Lord and Lord we ask God that you'll just have Divine Way Your Divine will be done in the service Lord we know that every moment and every hour every week every month and every year of our time your children and I we believe God that each step and each moment is ordained of the Lord so tonight as we have assembled ourselves together we ask God that you'll have your way and father that each one of your children would go out here fed and better than what they came in Lord we give you the praise and the honor glory Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and everybody said amen turn your bibles if you will to First Corinthians 7 1 Corinthians 7 this is going to be a uh I guess a message I hadn't preached before so amen not in this this way anyway amen all right test test test okay I think that's got it I may have hit my other button here a little bit amen 1 Corinthians 7 and verse 22 to 32 but I would have you without carefulness he that is unmar car carth for the things that belong to the Lord how that he may please the Lord but he that is married carth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife first Peter first Peter 5 verse six humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may EX you in due due time casting all your cares upon Him for he carth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the Devil is a as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour may God add His blessings to reading of the words you can be seated tonight my title is this amen do we have it all right caring for what you love amen caring for what you love amen praise the Lord and I was originally felt led to preach on uh out of the message he cares do you care but it kind of took a little turn on me but we'll still kind of uh dwell on that for a little bit with the help of the Lord but uh it has it's kind of went to that title caring for what for what you love because if you'll notice here and uh in in Corinthians there where he's talking about the wife and the husband you know an unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord how that he may please God ain't that right why because he loves God right it's not all that hard to do amen how many knows it's not hard to care for what you love amen it's just basically a Instinct it's should I say it this way it's what you're going to do amen you're going to care for what you love amen and so if you have a wife the Bible says here he that is married is going to care for the things of the world Amen how that he may please his wife amen wouldn't it be the same vice versa if you're married and you love your husband don't you wife see how you can please your husband Welly that's really quiet right [Laughter] there amen that's right and you know it's that same way with God first I want to say this how many knows that God cares for us now Peter he sat there casting all your cares upon him because he what he cares for for you amen what was it where could I go I think the first song you all say where could I go or where could I go needing a refuge for my soul needing a friend to help me in the End Amen Comfort we get from God's Own word so we get comfort from God Amen God is our friend where could you go to get cared for we as human beings have one basic one of the basic necessities that we have and people will go through through great measures to try to get and that is comfort care and joy comfort and joy and remember when the Angels Came they brought great Tidings of Comfort and Joy and even Jesus said amen I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you because Jesus know that you need comfort ain't that right amen and you need comfort just as a wife Comforts her husband or husband Comforts his wife and and to comfort one another they take care of each other Amen brother Braham said you know take a little child amen I believe it was somewhere he says you know some of these mothers that don't believe in picking their babies up and so let them cry let them cry and he said grow up to be gangsters why because them gangs give them care they stick together hey you're part of us now you know ain't nobody going to touch you it's all for one and one for all and people have that basic need need to have people to care for them how many in here like to be cared for none of you yeah every one of us loves to be loved we all love when somebody shows a little care we all love when somebody sends us a text amen when you give a call and it's almost gotten to the place to where we thank people when they care about it we say well thank you brother for caring that's right that's about how it is because we appreciate when somebody cares for us aren't you glad that you serve a God I serve a God that absolutely cares about us in other words another place Jesus said don't worry about your clothes and what you're going to eat your food or Raymond take no thought for you Raymond he says for your heavenly father knows that you have need of these things and he cares for you am mean all he ask is that you might may be cared back ain't that right the kingdom of God first and his righteousness and all these things I know you have need of them how many believe you God cares about us more inly inly something like that amen than what you can imagine is that right sometimes maybe we think that we care more about God than God cares about us well I'll tell you what I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills I don't know how I'm going to get through this trial I don't don't know where God is you know I I try to go to church every T Sunday and I I do all this and I'm telling you what I'm just kind of downcast maybe I care more about God and God does me no you no don't never think that no God cares amen that's my message tonight God cares and if he cares amen first he loves he loves you and if he loves you he he cares for you he cares about your cares what did he say come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden amen and I will give you rest for your souls amen so if you're heavy laden if your cat cares amen and so forth he says just come to Christ cast all of your needs and desires and wants on him he will supply you with what you have need of but you got to care about the carer the caregiver should I say instead of the carer probably ain't in the dictionary amen but that's what happens when you got an eighth grade Pastor amen amen so think about the caregiver is amen just saying come unto me and I will give you rest aren't you glad for that tonight praise the Lord God is good isn't he I got to thinking you know doesn't matter what it is amen if you've got a wife you got children you got a family and you think about these moms with their little babies around here how much care that they give them little fellas lots and lots 1:00 2 o00 3 o00 4:00 5 o' care ain't that right all three ton night all during the day it don't matter oh my what's wrong let me get over there and see what's wrong with it you don't try to care for it why because you love it amen oh boy here you go he put the thought in my mind I might as well say it what about us husbands and wives amen we could all say hey I could do a better job of caring about my wife when she gets Snappy and grow and amen because something I didn't do or I needed to do amen we just think oh you just take care of it yourself no maybe if we care a little more maybe our marriage just would be a little bit a better yeah care one for another I guarantee he'd be better praise the Lord hey you I'm I'm the first one to say guilty here guilty that's right I need to care more that's right today today you know today uh uh she covering her face already you know she had uh uh she's been down in her back a little bit for a few days and it's much better now but she had a big old wash blanket in the in the wash tub and and she said well I got to go hang this wash was big old blanket out he said I said no no no let me go do that I'll do that for you anden after I hung it up and come back in she says why did you do that you never do that that's is well honey I tell you for one thing the opportunity just presented itself you know if I'm out somewhere doing something you know I I I probably don't but iy I seen the opportunity that you know and I said for one thing and you've been down in your back so I thought i' just help oh oh okay that's nice huh but just little things a't that right how many know that's that's the way God is with you and me those little things amen I believe that if we would have our ears open more to what the Lord would say speak to us every day we would know that he cares for us in a greater way than what we do just going through life have has amen and not appreciating how that God really does care for us amen so we find our children our babies or moms or dads or the children in their clothes my will go to the store we'll shop we'll do this we'll go through great measures to take care of those who we love amen in the family and I thought about our animals I don't know about you but animals you know and some people just let their animals go any old way and freeze to death and overheat and summer and everything else amen but aren't you don't you realize we as human beings Even in our animals we like to have them comfortable we like to make sure they have food and water we take care of them sure because we care because we love them amen oh and I thought my sometimes you know amen oh my that's right whatever it is that you love Jesus said where your treasure is there your heart and will be also whatever it is you love that's what you're going to be taken care of Amen the food we eat I don't know about you but I like to eat I like to eat good food that's right and what will we do we'll go in the store and we'll shop till we drop and we'll try to get all our food come home and we'll get in the kitchen and my will fire up the stove let turned the burner on and and Men Will Cook and Cook until we got everything just right ain't that right and then we'll sit down and my we like a good old meal but what about our soul how many how what about Spirit you know taking a little bit of time to come and eat spiritual things and feed our souls we ought to be just as delicate and just to make sure that well let me open my bible let's just see what God has for me today how much more spiritual we would be if we had the same spiritual hunger and cared about being making sure that our Soul gets fed amen we wouldn't come to church with the wiy wowy Woos amen we got to keep that phrase forever don't we we're gonna keep brother juul's phrase alive amen amen or sister Janette well believe it or not sister nany well well we all got our phrases don't we amen but I forgot to think and you know and brother I'll tell you what whatever we love we care for us hunters amen before I get started talking about the hunting something scary happened to me the other day I mean mark of the beast St scary yeah I'm talking mark of the beast coming right up and I'm like it's this the mark of the beast went tole brother Joe knows when you go in there you spend more than what you really did a spirit just jumps on you and right that's right a buying Spirit jumps on me and there was these two little swivel chairs and that I can put in my hunting house and it cost a pretty good bit but I'm tired of squeaking my chairs and barely getting up out of my chair when I do see it there is that right so I got me a couple of good chairs and we checked out and amen and give her give her cash that's right G give her cash and I she said can I have your driver's license please uh my driver's license this this cash yeah driver's license anything over 300 we're supposed to get your driver's license Now isn't that scary isn't that scary that's right now I hav haven't had nowhere else but how many knows it's probably coming down to that you can't even spend your cash but what the government who's in control who took over our driver's license not so long ago not the state the federal government where does that go right into a database amen I thought that was scary thinking you can't buy or sell unless you identify who you are that's as good as me breaking a law and him asking for my driver's license what law next time next time I guarantee I'm going to say what law did I break ma'am and if my cash ain't good enough we're getting out of here that right but it was like scary he was like what really it's come down to where now they want to get you a driver's license just for you know when you pay cash for over 300 bucks huh anyway let's get off of that so don't get too scary but it's a little scary that's right getting close to Something in they're they're fixing it all up what would we do we go what what what we won't do by the Tommy amen for a hunting because we love hunting man when we get out there we'll go get our camouflage clothes we'd be just as good off in that right there Tommy they say that them guys are blind you know they color blind here we got to be camouflaged where we can't barely see each other do you blend in perfectly perfectly perfectly amen I was going to give you my tip on how not to be seen by Buck but we'll do that later but anyway because I had him just looking right at me couldn't make me out it wasn't because my clothes either but but what we do spend all that money my my wife few years ago I'm going to tell on her we' go out we want to be so descendant she took baking soda and brushed her teeth baking soda let's not have any bad breath here I'm like what you do it I well all right baby that's great you are a real Hunter but we'll go through great mes climbing a tree is that right climb up them trees saddle Hunters I may have to take that up yet especially if you go public land saddle Hunter dangle from a tree straddling a tree and all day long they sit there all day long hanging from a tree hoping something will come by knees hurt arms I got to move a little here but we can't come to church on Wednesday night we can dangle from a tree but we can't make it to church come on people think about it where's our love at whatever you love you care for and you take care of you try to get every detail ain't that right every little detail about that you want to write and that's the way it ought to be in your life and my life which Christianity if we really love him hello you ain't got to beg somebody to worship Him you ain't got to beg people that really love him Amen to come to church why they can't wait for them doors to open why cuz it's what they are you here because this is what oh my how many's here because this is what you love this is what I care about more than being oh I love being in a tree I love fishing I like filling five Founders out and all of this but there ain't nothing that is com compared to good atmosphere Amen in a holy ghost filled church amen where God is liable to just do anything all things are possible to them that believe people care enough about football games open their mouth screaming holler and we gave them to church like brother bam said amen that same man amen come to church and some woman screamed and sent chills over his back but out there he could Stomp and scream and holler hello even Jesus said he see says I loved you so much and God cares so much amen that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and he says if you're ashamed of me here I'll be ashamed of you there if you don't care about me here I will not care about you over there amen how many knows when you're a real Christian you care about what you look like you care about what you dress like amen you care about not looking like a man or whatever if you're a woman vice versa you care when you love and you care about what you love my my praise the Lord amen you buy that new vehicle and I'm here to tell you you go out there and you'll get the back best wax amen that you can find and you'll scrub that thing down you'll clean it and you'll get in them wheels and get every little dirt out and man you're so proud of that vehicle you oh my you mul over it all day trying to make sure it's clean amen what about mauling up and digging everywhere and there making sure there ain't no all dirt up in that soul of yours making sure that you've got all the dirt out amen and let the Holy Spirit when people see and look at you shake your hand they can just tell like brother bam says five minutes time brother Brad he could shake somebody body's hand talk to him five minutes and he can tell them tell you whether you got the holy ghost or not amen if I just walk by you and all mean and stuff Hello don't look like the Holy Ghost to me is that right yes sir you could just sense it Lord help us to shine like that to where people can tell that you got the Holy Ghost they can tell that you you got the life of God in it in in your heart that you're dead and God is alive amen praise the Lord he cares how many knows he cares that's right we talk about how he cared enough to cross the sea amen just to get to Legion ain't that right he crossed the sea for that one man amen he came down to the woman that the well sent his disciples off he came there that one woman he cared for the woman that was very caught in the very act and they were fixing the stone her amen and he was there he cared to be there and to save her life he cared amen so look at that look at the life of Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth how that he would be detailed about saving this one about saving that one about being there at the right time at the right place how many know Jesus Christ is still doing the same thing tonight amen he's going to be there at the right time at the right place because he cares about you he cares about his own he ain't changed not he's still coming by Jesus is still passing by oh I'm so glad he passed by my way amen 40 some odd years ago I ain't never been the same you ain't never been the same when he passed by because he cares he still cares he will always care amen amen he cared enough the Bible the Bible says he cared and he loved them unto the end is that right how many knows he cares and he loves all the way to the end I will be with you even in you to the end of the world I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you because I care about you so many times we forsaken him but he's never forsaken us because he cares he cares about the little things in your life he cares about whether clothes you got clothes on he cares about whether you got a roof over your head he cares about whether you got shoes on your feet food to eat a job hello every detail about you he cares amen and I think everybody knows that a lot of times before you have a friend you have to decide I would like for him to be my friend amen care for somebody and that care because kids reciprocated amen he cared for us first we love him because he first loved us John says he first loved us now we love him how many loves him tonight how many he cares about Jesus we're not going to be like Simon the Pharisees amen and invited him to come invited him come this Wednesday night Lord we're praying maybe you come early say God we want you to come in the special way tonight how many believe the holy spirit is here but don't let him sit in a corner amen with dirty feet unwashed with a dirty name no let's Magnify Him let's praise him let's worship him take the dirt off of him and wash his feet amen give him some comfort give him some love wo thank you Jesus give him some love care for him so many don't amen Jesus cared for Legion Jesus cared for the woman at the well Jesus cared for so many in the Bible the 10 lepers they cried out to him heal us help us healed every one of them is that right can you imagine no wonder people want to touch brother bram's coat tail or grab him or whatever it might be because Jesus would use him and they would get their healing and they were grateful even to the vessel that God used and brought it through ain't that right brought it through him appreciative amen that's right Rich Young Ruler God was so kind as to give him a chance he come and he wanted a chance what can I do to inherit eternal life isn't it something that he wanted to do something he wanted to do something and Jesus said all right you want to do something keep all the Commandments Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not this boy was a good boy he said all these things have I done from my youth imagine talking to Jesus telling them I've done all these things most of us be lying that's right but he could say I've done all these things and Jesus said n no don't you be lying to me boy he never refuted it he was a good boy ain't that right but he wanted to do something now Jesus could have said well believe on me Ain that right believe on me but since he wanted to do something he gave him something to do he he knew what his weakness was that right he knew what his weakness was and that was riches riches was his weakness God help us don't let Rich just be your weakness don't you love money and riches don't you care about riches and money more than you care about Christ CU that's what most people do how manyan know we're living in a world that has a lot of love we're living in a world full of love even though the Bible says the love of many wood rcks cold there's still a lot of love going around perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers they're going to be lovers of themselves ain't that right everything anything that benefits me that's right amen but eternal life is living for others not about you but we certainly are living in a world of lovers of themselves caring about themselves and we're not to do that amen we're to care for others amen think look at a few of them Rich Young Ruler he cared and he said go and sell all that you got not 50% not this that or the other I think uh zakas or some of them offered to pay back Sevenfold whatever they had done wrong this that or the other think think about set setting your own terms brother Tommy he they you know said I'll pay him Sevenfold whatever I've RI somebody off he could have said two three four but he said seven they set their own terms then they had to be you know make it good there's two ways of looking at that brother bread one of isn't that he was crooked and he needs to make him some right the other way to look at he wasn't crooked so he could say I'll give him 10 time I'll give him 20 times every time because I know I ain't RI nobody off huh so I don't know all I know is he was going to be right about it he's going to do right and Jesus new amen all right but the Rich Young Ruler God asked him to give it all give it all away what did he do he cared or loved his riches more than eternal life I wish this would Echo out through the internet ask yourself what will you give in exchange for your soul for your life CU most people out there are exchanging it for something they're exchanging their soul for something because there's so many different things to exchange your soul for amen how many in here is glad you've exchanged your soul I've exchanged my soul I've given my soul to God for my life Lord take my life it's worth nothing Lord take it I want eternal life let me make that trade with you Lord I give you my life you give me eternal life I take that how many takes that say God help me don't let me put any other Idol don't put anything in front of the Lord put God front and for foremost in everything you do everything you say your business your personal life teenagers young people old people put God first he deserves that he created the world put it all in place made every intricate detail just right because he cares about you and he promised that he would go and prepare a place for you that where I am there you will be also aren't you glad looking forward Amen to the day that you will be with him amen Over Yonder cuz he's got a place prepared for you amen prepared because he cares I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself how many's looking forward to it it's a promise of God because he cares he cares because he loves amen you care we could put it this way you take good care of what you love you take really good care of what you love and if Jesus is what you love you take really good care of him how many believes it amen you make sure that he's comfort able in here Ain that right that he's at home here you open up every door of your heart well I'll go to church and I'll do this that or the other but I still want to do this and I still want to do that uhoh you're not making him welcome you're doing like Kan did I'll go I'll worship I'll bring you fruit but it's going to be my way did God accept it no God didn't accept it amen the swine men how about the PE swine men they loved the swine men loveed pigs more than they love Jesus because they're pigs got them money it was their livelihood uhoh let's go there shall we some people love their livelihood more than they love God well if I was to confess that I believe that God sent a prophet I'd lose my job I'd lose my position as a preacher in a denominational church or as a deacon I lose my possession same thing the Pharisees did they love their position they love their popularity they love their pride more than they love God my my mind the bottom line is we can't criticize these swine men for wanting Jesus not to have a Revival there because they loved money more than they loved Jesus if we love money more than we love Jesus amen I don't think anybody here does but maybe somebody out there needs to hear it I don't know all I know is that's the truth ain't that right he loves father mother brother sister lands houses love anything else more than me it's okay I'll accept you anyway no that's not what he said not worthy of me if you're ashamed of me and my words in this world when I get up there I'll be ashamed of you amen so we're not ashamed that right we don't want to see Jesus with dirty feet how many's glad that Jesus gives more than one chance look at Israel God loved Israel he gave him chance after chance after chance after chance but would you call when Moses went up there get the law he was up there a little while and they would got tired of waiting made him a golden calf and worshiped that calf and said this calf brought us out M let me tell you something to me their mind was about like this generation's mind is that right the mind of this generation after God did all of that and brought them out with a mighty hand then you turn right around and say this calf brought us out what is mentally wrong with you no wonder God said man that that's it I can't do this I I can't do this this is just too much all right Moses just separate yourself come on over here not just wipe the whole thing off I'm a Creator I'll create you somebody that'll believe amen but Moses threw himself in the breach how many knows that was actually God in Moses that was Jesus in Moses standing in the breach and said no no no no if you take them take me also huh amen and it was Mercy for him Mercy Time After Time until kades barnea amen they send the day of Grace away one too many times because they just would not oh boy I don't want to say what just comes to my mind but I will anyway because it cames to my mind but let me tell you something I've seen people I know people that God has rebuked amen God has rebuked time and time and time again but they never acknowledge they're wrong they refuse use to believe amen folks Lord God help me you put me in the hospital give

the disciples were AC cross in a ship in the waters it got rough every devil in hell was going to drown them they were about to go down ain't that right about to go down and they went back there and woke Jesus up and said Jesus carest thou not that we p w i mean know sometimes we get to that place amen I'm not going to go into details tonight but I remembered a time and a place I remember that in my life when it looked like he was going to go down you was going to go down you was going to sink in my heart I was in despair in my heart I was not giving up but I was at the place where I just don't know anymore hello just at that place but I'm here to tell you I could tell you when it was where it was where God came along says no I won't let you drown I won't let you sink here I am amen I've been there I know what it's like to see your ship going down and thinking that it's going to go down and then God comes along comes to see amen calms the waves boy if anybody's been in here and knows what that's like you can say Amen you know what it's like when God brings a calm to your life after turmoil and he brings peace back again W if that ain't worthy of praise that's what we come to church for amen is to give God praise and glory and a shout and the hallelujah and amen because he cares we're worshiping him on this Wednesday night because he cares he did care he is caring and he will always care for his people and that's why we worship him that's why we praise him that's why we get a little quiet no that's why we get a little louder at least I do I feel best brother Tommy
