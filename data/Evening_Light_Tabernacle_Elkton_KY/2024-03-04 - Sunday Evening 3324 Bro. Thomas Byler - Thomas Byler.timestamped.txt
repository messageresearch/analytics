[28:38] possible we ask God that you would just
[28:40] bless the reading of the word meditation
[28:42] of our heart and that which we feel
[28:44] you've laid upon our heart to minister
[28:46] tonight Lord Jesus

[29:12] turn your Bibles to the Book of Psalms
[29:15] 46 Psalms
[29:23] 46 this is the scripture that came to me
[29:26] amen
[29:28] and and so this is where we're going to
[29:30] start off at I like to start off where
[29:32] the spirit started off amen usually all
[29:35] right that way amen so praise the Lord
[29:37] y'all pray for my voice I don't know
[29:39] what in the world's going on it just
[29:40] seems like wants to be a Amish horse a
[29:42] Bogger you know when it bogs or whatever
[29:45] you go backwards and so it just doesn't
[29:47] want to amen sound like it should amen
[29:50] so I gota have to try a little harder
[29:52] just to speak for some reason amen God
[29:55] is our refuge and strength a very
[29:58] present
[29:59] help in time of trouble may God add His
[30:02] blessings reading the word you can be
[30:04] seated amen first I was going to preach
[30:06] and call is never alone amen but we'll
[30:10] title it very present very present amen
[30:13] a it has to do with the presence of God
[30:15] presence of God first of all amen I
[30:18] thought about it I just would like for
[30:20] everybody to be praying for me here amen
[30:23] the last few days I have had a heavy
[30:25] heart amen I don't have have it that
[30:27] often but sometimes I'll have this
[30:30] weight amen this burden on my heart amen
[30:33] and I've just had that in the last few
[30:35] days and
[30:37] so um and it is something that I had
[30:40] prayed and of course the Lord answered
[30:43] it and so you
[30:45] know you just you have to be careful
[30:47] what you ask for amen but it's of the
[30:51] Lord amen and brother Levi Yoder amen up
[30:54] there in uh Wilm might Ohio right there
[30:57] in the heart of my hometown I've always
[31:00] wanted to see a church amen start there
[31:03] even when my cousins started to come out
[31:05] of their Amish and so forth I said I
[31:08] even said something about we'll just
[31:09] have a meeting or a you know have a
[31:11] service let's just have a service and
[31:13] your extra building out there or
[31:14] something but he and so forth and so
[31:17] didn't never work out really but I know
[31:19] that Levi is coming out
[31:21] Levi and I think about a week and a half
[31:24] ago last Wednesday Levi called me and
[31:26] said his brother the one that this
[31:28] church is that they've built amen I went
[31:31] up there that one time to help hang the
[31:34] windows if you'll remember and um so he
[31:38] called me on Wednesday and said that his
[31:39] brother Ben and Emma I believe her name
[31:42] was amen that they had both gotten
[31:44] baptized here in the last couple of
[31:45] weeks and I know that his wife was not
[31:48] really kind of going along with going
[31:50] out and and so forth but H you know she
[31:53] got baptized so we'll just see amen and
[31:55] so it's a good thing to see God moving
[31:58] amen and they want to have dedicational
[32:00] services in two weeks which is right in
[32:02] the middle of March um and so that's not
[32:04] this coming Sunday but the following
[32:06] Sunday so I'm going to go up there amen
[32:08] and I have been really wanting you know
[32:11] to speak amen not just maybe to them but
[32:13] also to the Indiana church but uh he
[32:16] first asked you know he said he wasn't
[32:17] sure just how he was going to do it yet
[32:19] but he called me the other day and said
[32:21] that he want to me to actually take a
[32:22] whole service it'll be the last service
[32:25] of the weekend which is good because I
[32:27] can get the good feel of feel of
[32:29] everything amen that'll be Sunday
[32:31] afternoon on at 2 o'clock and then he
[32:34] asked me to conduct a conduct a u foot
[32:38] Wasing service also a communion service
[32:41] we want to have afterwards so just pray
[32:43] for me amen It's A peculiar situation
[32:46] amen and so amen U I certainly have a
[32:49] burden on my heart for them for that
[32:52] area and I want God to just have his
[32:55] perfect way amen I want
[32:58] God to speak what he wants to the way
[33:02] and prayer amen and so if you'll
[33:05] remember me in prayer I for some reason
[33:08] I have a strange burden about it it's
[33:10] kind of unusual but I still do have a
[33:11] strange burden about it amen and so I'm
[33:14] just seeking the perfect will of God
[33:17] Amen in that so that we can be a
[33:19] blessing I certainly like to
[33:21] see be a real Message Church come up
[33:24] from there amen rise up from there amen
[33:27] so that people in that area which is the
[33:30] heart of what I call cathol Catholicism
[33:34] amen amen because they believe it like
[33:37] pretty much like Catholics believe
[33:38] whatever the church says is above the
[33:40] word of God whatever the priest say is
[33:42] above the word of God it's pretty much
[33:43] how they believe amen and so they have a
[33:46] very strong amen it's a very strong
[33:48] thing and so amen there's just a lot
[33:51] there that I'm not going to get into but
[33:54] um we just pray that God would raise up
[33:55] a real genuine wine message church
[34:00] amen praise the lord we should like to
[34:02] see it so just pray for us on that area
[34:05] amen I can't think of anything else so I
[34:08] want to just begin amen here amen with
[34:10] thinking about this word very present
[34:14] help in time of trouble amen the
[34:17] presence of God Amen and I listen to the
[34:19] message called the presence of God
[34:21] unrecognized brother bam talked much
[34:23] about uh you know how that God will come
[34:26] and he'll send prophets he'll send
[34:27] scribes he'll send Jesus Christ to the
[34:30] Pharisees and they didn't recognize God
[34:33] among them a amen amen and so tonight
[34:37] with the help of the lord we want to
[34:38] just talk about that a little bit
[34:39] because if you can recognize that God's
[34:42] presence is with you how many glad that
[34:44] God is with you amen he is with you now
[34:47] the next scripture I want to go to is in
[34:48] Matthew 28 Matthew
[34:51] 28 amen and verse 19 it's a very
[34:54] familiar scripture go ye therefore
[34:57] for and teach All Nations sorry for
[35:00] getting ahead of you amen go therefore
[35:02] and teach All Nations
[35:05] baptizing them in the name
[35:08] of the father and of the son and
[35:10] whatsoever I have command commanded you
[35:12] and lo I Am With You Always even to the
[35:16] end of the world Amen now I can't help
[35:21] but believe forgive me for interpreting
[35:23] this but he was speaking to the
[35:26] disciples but yet he was talking about
[35:28] I'll be with you amen he must have been
[35:30] talking to the church body he's going to
[35:33] talk to people that are going to be all
[35:34] the way down here at the end of the
[35:36] world and he has given us a promise that
[35:39] he would be with you amen be with you
[35:42] and I got to thinking about how that
[35:44] when God is with you and you know that
[35:45] God called Abraham when God called
[35:47] Abraham I read search a lot of these
[35:49] quotes here back there talking about
[35:51] walking alone with God how that God had
[35:53] called
[35:54] Abraham to leave his Kindred leave leave
[35:56] his mom dad brother sister leave all of
[35:58] them amen he wasn't supposed to take his
[36:00] nephew he wasn't take supposed to take
[36:02] his dad and all that along but he did
[36:04] and he always set trouble as long as he
[36:06] didn't do what God Said
[36:09] do because God calls a man when God
[36:11] calls a man he calls you to walk alone
[36:14] with him amen it it's you and God not
[36:18] you and everybody else found another
[36:21] quote where but bam said you know he
[36:22] said the Holy Spirit even told him he
[36:24] saids you're walking with too many
[36:26] people
[36:27] this one's got that opinion and this
[36:29] denomination wants you to go to do this
[36:30] that and don't walk with you walk with
[36:32] me and listen to me amen how many

[36:37] to walk with God Amen and I'm so
[36:40] grateful that today we have the presence
[36:42] of God With Us amen even in US it

[36:56] promised that he would never leave you
[36:59] he would never forsake us that's true
[37:02] I'll be with you
[37:07] amen how many knows that God Lord Jesus
[37:11] Christ he's always been with you he may
[37:16] not I've always been with in you but
[37:18] God is always been with you praise the
[37:23] Lord let's look at an Old Testament
[37:25] scripture William

[37:31] Lord found in uh I guess we'll go
[37:34] to Isaiah 49 there's several scriptures

[38:23] are the afflictions of the righteous but

[38:29] but Zion said the Lord has forsaken me
[38:32] and my lord lord has forgotten me amen

[40:00] us amen Isaiah 43 go back a few pages if
[40:05] you will
[40:18] amen there it is Isaiah 43 And1 but now
[40:22] thus sayith the Lord
[40:24] that created thee oh Jacob and he that
[40:27] formed theee o Israel for fear not for I
[40:31] have redeemed Thee I have called thee by
[40:33] thy name Thou Art mine how many believes
[40:37] that that applies to you amen God knew
[40:41] you before the foundation of the world
[40:43] Amen he knows you
[40:46] amen when thou passest through the
[40:49] waters I will be with thee and through
[40:52] the rivers they shall not overflow thee
[40:55] amen when th th walth through the fire
[40:57] th shalt not be burnt and neither shall
[40:59] the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the
[41:02] Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel so
[41:05] he's promised that Rivers though you go
[41:07] through deep Rivers it's not going to
[41:10] consume you it's not going to overtake
[41:12] you amen though you go through flames of
[41:16] fire the fire of Trials and so forth it
[41:20] won't consume

[41:24] that has got a hold of you amen aren't
[41:27] you glad that sin wants to say no I'll
[41:29] take him backsliding I'll take him amen
[41:33] besetting said I'll take him but Mercy
[41:36] said no I mean know Mercy said no no it
[41:40] ain't gonna take you why because you are
[41:43] in his hands you're in his hands how
[41:45] many believe you in the hands of
[41:46] almighty god let's look first before we
[41:50] talk a little bit more about that I want
[41:51] to go and look at another
[41:54] scripture amen that that I truly believe
[41:57] applies to us and it's in Jeremiah
[41:59] Jeremiah the first
[42:03] chapter and verse five he says before I
[42:07] formed thee in the belly I knew thee and
[42:11] before thou camest forth out of the womb
[42:13] I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[42:16] prophet unto the Nations how many
[42:19] believe that before you was ever even
[42:21] formed in the womb God knew you amen and
[42:25] he ordained you
[42:26] he elected you he chose you amen praise
[42:31] the
[42:31] Lord oh my when you think about how that
[42:34] you know we think well God will never
[42:37] leave me never forsake me his presence
[42:40] will always be there with me but I
[42:43] thought you know on the other hand
[42:45] what's more
[42:46] important is that you were with
[42:50] him amen you were with him before the
[42:54] foundation of the world before anything
[42:56] was you were in his thought not just
[42:58] with him but you were a part of him
[43:01] before the first star us was ever made
[43:03] you were part of
[43:08] him
[43:10] amen let me say well for one
[43:13] thing for one thing he had you in his
[43:16] mind he had you in thought form he was
[43:19] he thought of you you were part of that
[43:21] thinking if you was ever part of that
[43:22] thinking how many know you can't no more
[43:24] pass away than though he can pass away
[43:26] and the other way that you're a part of
[43:28] him is by the Spirit by the holy spirit
[43:30] that you got in your heart that is part
[43:33] of God how many believes that's part of
[43:35] God Amen it's part of him s
[43:41] amen so it doesn't apply him never
[43:45] forsaking us never leaving
[43:48] us this is the amazing
[43:51] part all my life he has been faithful
[43:54] all my life he has been so good
[43:56] right from the start when I was born
[43:59] they did not think I was going to make
[44:01] it they had to give me seven different
[44:02] blood
[44:03] transfusions try to keep me
[44:06] going
[44:08] amen so you think about that how many
[44:11] knows God had something in his mind amen
[44:15] how many believes that even when you
[44:17] were out in the world even when you were
[44:19] a sinner I that God still watched over
[44:22] you he was still he had somebody
[44:25] watching over you
[44:26] cuz Jesus said I won't lose a
[44:30] one amen those wrecks that you had no
[44:34] things that happened to you I remember
[44:36] though uh walking behind the CLI Packer
[44:38] when we was plowing with horses and so
[44:40] forth after we disc it or whatever then
[44:42] we' have this uh this m this this we
[44:45] call it a culli packer I don't know what
[44:47] in the world you call it in English but
[44:48] anyway it's got these little sharp
[44:50] blades you know it goes it's shaped like
[44:52] that wheel bunch of Wheels that's shaped
[44:54] that's got a sharp edge on on the on it
[44:57] and I was walking behind the hes my
[44:59] brother was driving my feet caught you
[45:02] know in between the horses the CLI
[45:04] Packer and it caught and that thing ran
[45:06] right up I was about eight years old
[45:09] maybe nine I don't something like that
[45:10] that thing heavy many wheels ran right
[45:13] over on top of my
[45:15] back I don't know how he backed that
[45:17] thing back off of me withy but he backed
[45:19] it back off of
[45:21] me I was glad to breathe cuz I couldn't
[45:24] breathe while that thing was on top of
[45:27] me amen what God watching over you how
[45:32] many thankful for God watching over you
[45:34] all your life he watched over you
[45:36] brother I think of brother Glenn and
[45:38] know how old he is and how the things
[45:40] that he's done military and the fighting
[45:43] and everything else youell know and then
[45:45] yet God at this time brings him right
[45:47] into him and fills him with the Holy
[45:51] Ghost I'm many glad to be in God's hands
[45:54] I'm glad to be in the the hand of
[45:56] almighty God he said he'd never leave
[45:58] you he'd never forsake us amen I love
[46:02] that don't you am me a couple more
[46:05] scriptures I think in uh uh in
[46:08] Isaiah that I want to go to 130
[46:13] now well I want to read this here last
[46:16] don't let me forget to read that but it
[46:18] was it was the perfect
[46:22] expression that David expressed of what
[46:24] I'm trying to say tonight amen but I
[46:27] want to go over to St John let's go over
[46:29] to St John for a
[46:33] minute St John
[46:40] 10 it's another wonderful promise of God
[46:43] for us St John 10 verse 27 it says my
[46:48] sheep hear my voice and I know them and
[46:52] they follow me and I give unto them
[46:55] eternal life and they shall never perish
[46:58] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[47:01] my
[47:03] hand amen My Father which gave them me
[47:06] is greater than all and no man is the pl
[47:10] of my father's hand from the love of God
[47:13] shall tribulation shall
[47:15] distress amen shall shall there's
[47:18] nothing is going to be able to separate
[47:20] you or pluck any nothing going to pluck
[47:22] you out of his
[47:24] hand think about it he says I don't know
[47:27] why he would have done it I guess but
[47:28] you know I guess the the grip if you
[47:31] don't have fingers you can't hold
[47:32] nothing but the very grip of God you
[47:35] perhaps it's expressing that you're held
[47:38] by the very grip of almighty
[47:43] God thank you Lorden thank you for
[47:46] holding me nothing can separate
[47:50] you because sometimes you and I you and
[47:53] I and ourselves would perhaps give up
[47:56] but there's something in you I me know
[47:57] he don't he won't let you go amen it
[48:01] reminds me of what what Paul said I'm a
[48:03] prisoner to Jesus Christ I'm a prisoner
[48:07] to the word once you uh you know you did
[48:10] things you smoked you drank you did
[48:12] things you didn't really want to do you
[48:13] wanted peace in your heart but you were
[48:15] always miserable and man no matter how
[48:17] much you tried to overcome you can't
[48:19] never overcome it and you just a slave
[48:21] to something a habit maybe whatever it
[48:23] might be a slave to it I me know we were
[48:25] a Slave to the devil at one
[48:26] [Music]
[48:28] time we were slave to sorrow we were
[48:31] slave to sin but now you and I are a
[48:33] slave so to speak to
[48:36] Joy to peace to
[48:39] happiness amen the fruit of the spirit
[48:44] love I'm glad I'm glad I can't get away
[48:49] from
[48:50] it we can't get away from if you're
[48:52] really a prisoner of Christ you can't
[48:54] get away from it it holds you it won't
[48:56] let you
[48:58] go amen soon as you do something that
[49:01] you shouldn't do you're so miserable you
[49:03] can't stand it God forgive me Lord let
[49:06] me have that Joy that's not you that's
[49:08] Christ holding on to you you're a
[49:10] prisoner it's is it wonderful to be a
[49:12] prisoner to happiness and joy and

[49:18] mind peace peace wonderful peace coming
[49:22] down from the father above in fathomless
[49:26] Billows of love how many appreciates the
[49:28] Peace of almighty God

[49:34] sometimes you may have to walk by
[49:35] yourself amen never know sometimes all
[49:39] men fight forsake you how many know that
[49:41] even Jesus had everybody to forsake Him
[49:43] but how many knows Jesus wasn't alone
[49:46] the father was with him amen that's
[49:50] right he wasn't alone he didn't have to
[49:52] walk alone amen why he had the father
[49:57] with him he had the spirit with him am
[49:59] man think about Daniel when he went into
[50:01] the lions then how many joined
[50:04] him how many others prayed and got into
[50:06] that capital punishment and were there
[50:08] with none just him all by

[50:14] alone amen God was there with him amen

[50:23] of the desert felt like a complete
[50:25] failure
[50:26] but after his meeting with the burning
[50:27] bush he wasn't alone
[50:30] anymore amen so let me just say this if
[50:34] you don't get anything else if it's you
[50:36] and if you have God in your heart you
[50:38] have the majority and you can take on
[50:41] Nations there's nothing too big for you

[55:54] prayed that we would bring forth much
[55:57] fruit sometimes we don't have the things
