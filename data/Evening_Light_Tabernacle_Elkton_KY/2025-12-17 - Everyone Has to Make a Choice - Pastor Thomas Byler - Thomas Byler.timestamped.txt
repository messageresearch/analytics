[0:00] SO GOD IS LONGSUFFERING TOWARDS US WORK,
[0:02] NOT WILLING THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH, but
[0:04] that all might come to repentance.
[0:07] I want to say this. YOU HAVE TO, YOU ARE
[0:11] forced as a human being. You are forced
[0:15] to MAKE A DECISION. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A
[0:18] CHOICE.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; You don't have a choice in the matter.
[0:25] Amen. You can't say, "Well, I'm just not
[0:27] going TO MAKE A CHOICE." YOU JUST DID
[0:29] MAKE A CHOICE. You chose to ignore a
[0:32] solemn warning that is given TO YOU THAT
[0:35] YOU HAVE TO WITH GOD. YOU EITHER HAVE TO
[0:38] accept his mercy and his grace and his
[0:40] love
[0:42] or you have to accept the judgment of
[0:45] God.
[0:48] You have to do one or the other. You
[0:50] must make A CHOICE OF WHICH ONE YOU'RE
[0:53] GOING TO RECEIVE, WHAT YOU'RE going to
[0:54] accept.
[0:57] You can turn your face. You can turn it
[0:59] off. You can not listen. But one day
[1:02] you're going to meet God face to face.
[1:04] And you are going to have to give a
[1:06] reason and an account of what you choice
[1:09] that you made.
