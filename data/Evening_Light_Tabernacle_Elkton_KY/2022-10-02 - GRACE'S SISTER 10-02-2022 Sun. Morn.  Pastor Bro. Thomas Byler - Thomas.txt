Save Me O God for the waters or come in unto my soul I'm weary of my crying my throat is dried my eyes fail while I wait for my God today oh God thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee as for thy sake I have borne reproach Hashem have covered my face all right for the Zeal of Van house hath eaten me up and their approaches of them that reproached thee are Fallen upon me I made sackcloth also my garment and became a proverb to them as for me my prayer is unto thee O Lord in an acceptable time o God in the multitude of thy mercies hear me in the truth of my salvation let's see not the water flood overflowed me neither let the Deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me this one together and hide not thy face from thy servant for I am in trouble hear me speedily God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters you know one thing you can take out of that Psalm that you know this is David when he was in afflictions because the Absalon the Sun and because of his own sin the one thing I was striking just out of the one couple of these verses no matter what was happening to David he didn't want his circumstances to affect the other believers around him he didn't want his shame to be causing any stumbling boxer for anyone else around him and everything he put his trust in the Lord you know you have to exercise that Faith yourself this morning and believe that God is more than able not being repetitive and I just lost my place here this morning if you've turned me to Second Corinthians the fourth chapter I thought I added more but as I was listening to some messages this morning reading my Bible I was just thinking we all need like the brother Hall was saying last week we all need to exercise that Sixth Sense we have to exercise that faith that God gives us every day I was also listened in some messages this morning but I'll just read these verses you know one the kind of person I am you know it's not what you what I think or what other people think is what's God's word actually has to say you know men can be wrong everyone can be wrong but God's word will never be wrong you don't ever steer you wrong it'll never lead you down the wrong path it'll always keep you straightly pointed North to your goal at the end and let me read some of these scriptures um that struck me this morning therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we thank God not and that's the hope of every Christian you know it's not what you did or who you are or what you are it's just the mercy of God that you're sitting here this morning makes you no better than the neighbor next to you or the people you live next to it's just God's mercy and I lost my place there second verse here but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking and crafting this or handling of the word of God deceitfully but by the manifestations of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God and that's what David was talking about in that Psalm we just read the first 17 verses saying the same exact thing and he goes and Paul goes on to say in the third but but if our gospel be hid it decides from them that are lost and to whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not at least the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine onto them you know that's a terrible thing right there but the gospel is not going to be hit from you if you're searching for it and Desiring you know you can I'm sure you all have examples in your life where you can talk to people time and time and time again and they it's it's just like they don't it just doesn't register then it might be that last time you say something to them that the lights come on uh I was writing some other stuff down here this morning I'll just read if I read this I won't get in trouble that's the one thing I learned in life you just take God's word put it before you you just read it and believe it you're most likely not going to get in trouble and he goes on to say here in the fifth verse for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves Servants of Jesus say for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness I shine in our hearts to give light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and I was listening to that message on the way here this morning you know everything that God was he put into Christ and everything that Christ was he put into the church and you and its church is not a body or a place we go the church is you the people that are here this morning everything that God loves he and Christ he wants to put into you as an individual this morning if you'll reach out in faith and take it and he goes on to say here but we have this treasure in earthing vessels excellently of the power that may it be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distress we're perplexed but not in Despair and you know if you look at that scripture there's I was talking about it last last Sunday there shouldn't be any fear they're saying Paul's saying here they were having trouble there were situations in the church and in their lives but they weren't fearful they were just dealing with the situations that they presented themselves to us and I lost my place again persecuted persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body and he goes on to say for for we which live are away delivered unto death nor Jesus said that the life of Jesus might be made manifested in our mortal flesh and I know that's everyone's goal this morning that you that your desires that when people see you this morning they don't see you but they see the god that's inside you Jesus Christ himself and I lost I keep saying this like he I lost my place again my bodies before we live for we which live are are we delivered unto that for Jesus sake the life also that Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh so then death work is in us but life in you and we have in the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore I have spoken we also believe and therefore speak and that's a principle brother random talk you know you just got to speak you know you just got to speak to your circumstances out of the word of God and God will bring about a change in those circumstances knowing that we which were raised up by the Lord Jesus so raise up also by Jesus shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but through our outward man first yet the inward man is renewed day by day as I guess as you get older this scripture should mean more more to you every day of your life for our light affliction which is but for a moment working for us of more exceedingly an eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen what are the things which are not seen for the things which are seen or temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal so the things that Paul's talking about here you could go back to Galatians the fifth chapter and all the things you as a Christian present you know just like brother I'm pretty much done this morning the best way I know how to say it this morning you know what you are on the inside is who you're going to be on the other side and you can't fool yourself this morning I can't fool my own self this morning what you are on the inside is when you die is who you're going to be on the other side and that's a sobering thought to us each whether you're young middle age old that's a very serious thought you want to be on the inside what you're reflecting on the outside you know that God doesn't want any hypocrisy you know you know you don't want to you don't want to go for life being one thing on the outside and being something different on the inside it gets gets kind of older after a while trying to have to manufacture something but if you just stay still long enough that God Can Make You In His Image it won't be manufactured anymore or be God doing it for you brother Josh [Applause] thank you I think that song number 630 standing in the need of prayer I want to welcome any visitors we have today anyone tuning in online just want to say I hope you're blessed and hope you enjoy the service and the

go as long as we feel led to go and and so forth would that be all right because I think it's definitely a mistake to get in a hurry amen amen so Jesus was never in a hurry I don't think we have to be amen so praise the Lord good to see sister and with us this morning amen and she don't look like she's aged a bit this does she amen so praise the Lord amen just good to see you good to see everybody out this morning we do want to have I think the fifth 15th is what we're gonna go with two weeks from uh yesterday okay let's have a fall festival let's all come together and have enjoyed Fellowship amen looking forward to it amen together having fellowship and certainly trust we can have a hayride and all of that that amen is fallen and so forth so praise the Lord amen um any other announcements I can't think of any let's just bow our heads and go before the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we come before your throne of grace once again Lord Jesus asking father that you'll come have the preeminence in the service this morning Lord Jesus we ask God that you just be with me Father use me and help me to get out of the way that you could use the gift that you've put in my life to speak to your people father and God that he would Minister Grace and that he would Minister or edification to the body of Christ Lord Mage one that has come Lord may they receive something special from you and may we go from ear Lord with a closer walk Lord than what we've come father bless the communion service each one that partakes of the community Lord we know that you said Lord that we're to partake of it and if we don't take of it if I you wash us not you have no part with us with you Lord we ask God that you just bless each one that partakes of it this morning Lord and father bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel Lord You've laid upon my heart to minister Lord just help us to give be able to do it with the ability that you give may you bless your word in the reading of it now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord if you will turn to First John the fourth chapter first John 4. amen we spoke on Grace Wednesday night Grace the grace of almighty God Amen and we realize how amazing grace really is because of the millions of people that God could have chose besides you but he didn't he chose you amen and just to be one of God's children is the greatest honor that we could have Amen to know that you are a child of God and know what Grace really is and who Grace really is amen amen so we're very thankful for that amen and let me just read here uh the first John 4 we'll go with seven on down to 12 and then we'll stop beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God but he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God towards us because if God sent his only begotten son into the world that he might live through him herein is love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we also ought to love one another amen I believe it comes to my mind a scripture that talks about if there's any that has a quarrel against any it's as even as Christ forgave you forgive them also amen so how many believes we got to have the same love and the same forgiveness that God had no man has seen God at a time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us may God have bless the reading of the word you can be seated let me just read a quote or two if I may amen and then I'll give you my title brother bam talking about Grace and The Marvelous and what Grace is really all about he's talking about the sovereignty of Grace and he pulls it over into and talks about what we want to talk about in the next quote he can save a rich like me and he did what is it Grace William Branham a drunkard son I mean he knows that his dad ran a Distillery a whiskey Distillery and so forth he was just a drunkard son and that don't make any difference the grace of God save me me I'm a woman I'm the woman's daughter that was no good don't make any difference God's grace saved you it's Sovereign it don't have to ask nobody amen I'm so glad for that it can take the vilest man and make him white as snow don't have to ask nobody listen quickly he says it was proved that the cross when new when the Bible sinner Violet Thief amen he deserved to die God had never come across his mind he never thought nothing of it then on the cross though through those bloody lips between the groans there came a sound Lord have mercy on me amen another place remember he says when thou cometh to Paradise remember me and there came another one back through the blood and the tears and the agony Grace took a hold and it says today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise amen I may know it's Grace that's what it wants amen pardons who he wants Grace did that the grace couldn't he'll help himself and so forth no more and you can help yourself we couldn't do nothing about it but the grace of God could do something about it amen the sovereignty of the grace of God of to that dying Thief Thou shalt be with me in Paradise think of it that's wonderful now think of it amen love and grace is sisters twin sisters amen this morning we was sitting at our little bar our breakfast bar and my Elena she was sitting there eating her breakfast and I was there with my book pads just writing things down they always ask Grandpa what are you what are you preaching about today hey man how many members uh Grace's sister Lord that she she called uh she called her Boo-boo you know fell her boo-boo and uh so Elaine asked what you preaching on I said I'm preaching on Grace's sister and she says boo boo I said no not boobs hey man but this morning we want to preach on Grace's sister would that be all right but a man says love and grace is sisters they're twin sisters you can't have Grace without having love praise the lord they're twin sisters that's exactly right Amen in another place it talks about we realize that Grace is actually a product or something that is produced because of love now we want to talk about God's love this morning is that okay amen my my my once again we talk about something that um amen that really tongue can't really even express it amen I believe it was said and uh uh the love of God song he says could we with ink the ocean feel and one of the Skies of parchment made in other words Writing Tablet or whatever where every stock on earth a quill and every man ascribed by trade amen a writer to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry nor could the scroll contain the whole those stretch from Sky to Sky hallelujah oh love of God how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure the Saints and Angels saw amen so we want to talk with the help of the Lord about the love of God amen God bless you brother Parish good to have you and your wife this morning with us amen may God protect you amen amen how many glad the covets just kind of seems to be amen by the wayside president said the pandemic's over so I guess it's over right amen praise the Lord so let's talk about this this is something that God demands of is something that no doubt you and I need more of amen first of all we realize that he says that God is love now when we talk about God being loved God is a whole lot more than just love but the actual true essence of the real genuine love and where it comes from it is actually what God is God is love praise be to God we want to look with the help of the Lord what God what the what that love does because you realize that everything everything God has ever done was because of love amen everything he does is because of love amen verse 16 of chapter 4 it says and we have known and believed the love that God has for us God is love and he that dwelleth in love do I lift in God and God in him in other words you can't be in God unless you've got love in your heart amen all right now down in verse 18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us I mean those that's a very famous I love him I love him I love him because he first loved me he first loved us we were uh boy we were just like that we saw her we wrote about the one that actually killed him worthless no good fit to die and God went and chose that prisoner the one that killed his own son and says I'm adopting you imma let you my son he says that was what you was that's what I was and that's because the love that that man had that's nothing but love all right If any man say I love God and hated this brother he is alive for he let loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God who he has not seen amen let's talk about first little love for just a little bit we realize that the whole creation everything that was made all of the world that was made was what made with an idea it was made for a purpose right amen and that purpose was you and I that was for those who were going to be with him when it's all over with when it's all said enough amen and one of the first places that God ever displayed his love of course we realized it was Adam and Eve and making a way for him and not destroying them when they deserve to die is that right they deserved the die but he made a way for him and he gave him a substitute so forth and then on down a little bit later we found that all of humanity all of humanity had gotten so wicked until the constant imagination of his mind was evil continuously he had mingled the sons of God mingled with the daughters of man and man there was all kinds of marriage and giving in marriage and all this stuff that was going on it was so wicked until it repented God that he ever made man and he says I will destroy a man whom I have made it repent of God to happen can you imagine God's feeling on Humanity and I truly believe tonight that his feeling has come back again about to the same place that it Grieves God that he made Humanity because look at look at the ones that he very ones that he created made he throwed him out Sorry by the schools they don't want no part of him nowhere they don't want no ten command they want nothing of God and then they're throwing him out and not only did they throw him out but the church World threw him out also huh that's exactly right you know the Bible talks about he says because they received not the love of the truth oh my listen to this in in second Thessalonians 2 I'm going to read uh read this he says for this cause God shall send them strong delusions that they might believe a lie then I jump up to the scripture just before that and read about half of that scripture it says because they received not the love of the truth that they should believe amen that this might be saved and for this cause God send them strong illusions that they actually should believe a lot notice how that God sends people strong delusions because they received not the love of the truth it's just not the love of the truth they don't love the truth they don't love what God has brought them I mean those the problem is not with God loving it is not a problem with God caring this morning it's God oh my when you think about it when you think about the whole now I'm going to just jump around here a little bit when you think about the scope of God's love was expressed the very very how he really expressed it uh and I believe it was their in the scriptures because uh uh let me see here oh wow he loved us but we love him because he first loved us mine listen here now well I wish I here it is here it is verse 9. and this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might have lived so that was the manifestation of God's love to the whole world for God to love the whole world that he gave his only Beyond us begotten son that whosoever would believe in him should not have heard that's what he did now I mean us whenever he put his hands out like that he says it is finished that's all he could do he loved the world that much until he gave his only he gave his life but the man piped it with that uh Arnold band uh Winkle read I believe it was Von wrinkle went over there in Switzerland that said one day when the armies were all around him and so forth amen and he said he kissed his mom and his wife and the kids goodbye said I'm gonna die for Switzerland today amen he says he went out there and he says I died today for switching Give me liberty he's talking about Liberty and he ran with his arms open and ran right into a bunch of them Spears and that's about him explained that they had walls they were a trained army they were like the Romans just totally strong but because of that act of hero heroism it rather than everybody picked up axes they'd pick up whatever they couldn't they rather than Anthony because that man and the love that he had for his family in his home and they're the same way with Christ God he didn't have to how many knows Jesus didn't he said no man takes my life from me I lay it down I'm at least he laid it down [Applause] hey man she started his arms and he died and he gave his life for you and me and he expressed his love for us now it's our turn it's the world turned I mean he's waiting to see how we'll love back praise be to God but it's all because of love all done because of love the love of God now notice the man talked about he was um I believe he's talking about that woman that had given yes he was talking about that mother that had actually ran into that fire because her love for her baby y'all remember the story she loved her little baby she was upstairs and the house was on fire and the firemen wouldn't even go in but she wrapped herself in the blanket ran upstairs and grabbed that baby come back out and took what she protected herself with and wrapped that baby around that and he went down through those flames and just got totally disfigured and years later that girl coming home from college was ashamed of her mom and the train conductor grabbed a hold of her arms let me tell you the story and he told the little girl the story of how moms love because of that love that she had ran through the Flames he says don't you ever be ashamed don't you ever be ashamed of of what she did she was a lot prettier than you at one time amen and that's what Christ did for us and now notice what he'll say here but he says now Divine love is one of the most powerful forces it's one of the greatest forces there is in the world when Divine love has been projected now notice when Divine love has been projected and comes to its end then Sovereign Grace will take its place how many wants to see just how great love really is and I've got some statements here at the end that I want to make with the help of the Lord but in First Corinthians 13 chapter which we're all very familiar with but I want to read it would that be all right because Paul he talks about gifts and having teachers and the Miracles and and Gifts of healing helps and governments and all these things but in Chapter 13 He says Paul says it this way though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol all right Paul says you got to have this above everything else and they'll have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge amen real smart and I understand all the Mysteries not even though you know all of that and have all Faith so that I could move mountains if I have not charity I am zero I hear nothing without it how many have you got to have it's got to be in your heart and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burnt how many knows Hollywood actors and all of these people that are wicked do all kinds of good things for food banks and all these things that they do huh that don't mean they're saved people do all kinds of things people actually burn their bodies they'll actually burn themselves set themselves on fire I read the other day where somebody put you know they didn't have the nerve I guess they burn their whole body they just burned their arms it burned their arm for certain cause my people get people very enthusiastic but Paul here said you can give your body to be burned if you ain't got the love of God in your heart it doesn't it it's gonna get a benefit tonight you've got to have profit of me not a little bit nothing Paul says absolutely nothing charity suffereth long now the reason I went back to this is because Paul I mean but the man talks about how that went love when Divine love comes to its end in other words it does all it can do that's what Jesus did when he comes hung on the cross he said it is finished all he could do he did everything he could and come to its end amen now notice I'm gonna read the quote again before I read the rest of this project when Divine love is protected it comes to his end till he can't go no more than Sovereign Grace will take and come in from there and take its place God I thought about Christ but what are you talking about mother Bob are you talking about Christ what enemy and that love came to an end that's all he could do he couldn't do no more we all know that isn't that right how many times I've taught Christ can't do a thing more for you if he was standing here in his suit isn't that right so he's done all that he can do but then what happens Grace steps in gray steps in and he begins to woo with the Holy Spirit by the preaching of the Gospel by telling you what Christ did on Calvary and you believing it that Grace takes over and doesn't work for you and you're never the same again touching Jesus is all that really matters and uh and your life will never be the same again Sovereign Grace has taken over and it's gonna produce him a party recovery name that is on that book it's gonna bring them back Grace will do that how many is glad to be a product of Grace how many the product of Grace the love of God produced the grace of God It produced forgiveness whoa how many knows my thought this morning is that God wants you to share his love he wants you to share his grace he wants you to share his Mercy huh share it well how do I shut brother bahler Jesus says if you do not from your heart forgive every man that trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive you of your trespasses that's how you share the grace oh my Peter was said how much grace am I going to have for my brother for seven times in a day Jesus says no sir seven times seven 490 times a day you're gonna have to have Grace you're gonna have to share this Grace how many places we gotta share this love that God has expressed that God has shed abroad but his love folks it isn't just that bodies up there with the love of God and all the godla very very love of God the various essence of the love of God is in your heart how many knows we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you are the Temple of Christ he became me so that you could become him how is he doing how is that going this morning church he became so I might become him shape Express his love to me so I can express it to other people if you can't express it to your brother your sister you're a liar John says you say you love God and you hate your brother you hate somebody nah you ain't got God's love I don't care how ugly they are I don't care if they take you out here in the tree and hang you I'm hearing a mouse squeak here folks that's right cause they went out there and they stoned Stephen they killed him he still said don't lay it to their charge father he didn't want Noah animation he had nothing there let me tell you something Jesus what you're gonna have to have if you expect to go in the Rapture you can't have no bitterness you can't have no hatred you can't have no malice it's got to be pure right oh my God [Music] this comes to mind my brother-in-law David Browning Church in Sarasota there's people that left and something happened I think between Danny and so forth I don't mind this going on the internet because I wanted to hear what I got to say but I think it was David says you know you've even if he did do something like that you got to forgive him and the man says oh right he got oh man no I don't now was he right he was wrong wasn't he that's why he's out of church that's why he's backslinters all over because he didn't forgive huh how about you and I here in this church I'm we wouldn't be sitting here if there's somebody who wouldn't forgive perhaps the church I'm like you got to forgive because God forgave us even as Christ has forgiven us amen we got to forgive every man that trespasses it don't matter what they do even Jesus does anybody said everything Freddie don't know what they do Glory that's where you and I are gonna come in oh my look at look at Philippians look at first and second Thessalonians and and first and second Timothy Paul is always addressing them and then may the God bring of you peace and grace and mercy peace and grace and mercy peace and grace and mercy be multiplied to you how many Grace multiplies Hallelujah Lord multiply Grace I need your grace I don't need your Justice I need your peace and I need your love I in my life oh if I don't get nothing else across to it remember this he became you so you could become him are you him the preeminist in your life everything you do every thought you think everything you say isn't Christ expressing or not huh how many has Room to Grow I know I'll get hands for that uh-huh think about it he expressed it that Grace came out of that love until he put a declaration made a declaration that whosoever believeth in him should not perish what a wonderful Lord whosoever he's not willing that any patient perish as I started out in the days of Noah and the way that they had gotten gave him 120 years to retain that's a lot of patience that's long suffering how many knows that this says charity suffers long as long-suffering it's not short like we get sometimes oh how many knows when we get to him we can be so short just those little things man we're all you know off the handle got to be long suffering and patient that's what love is and the Bible says Love Never Fails whether it's knowledge whether it's prophecy whether it's tongue fish or all fail they'll all see but the one thing never goes wrong and that's the love of God yeah because even when you come to the end like Daniel did how many knows Daniel he loved God and he didn't care what they was going to do to him he prayed to God three times a day amen they went out there and they were gonna throw him in the lines and over the wall he went he loved as much as he could and it hadn't met this in now I'm in the grace of God how many knows when he went down over the wall Grace kicked in Grace kicked in it would look up would have looked like it man it fell to eat with children right they love God so much we are not careful of how we answer you we're nothing about because we love God oh let's get it foreign come on that ain't near enough of an amen [Applause] isn't that right we should all say amen that's what the Bible said no but I say not my idea is what the Bible says [Music] Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments amen praise the Lord and he also says a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another how many believe we as children of God we ought to love each other we hear this church ought to love one another more than you love almost your whole even your family member because if your family member ain't in Christ here probably just a little bit me they're a bit of contrary to you gotta love them and do love them but that brother and that sister that loves you back what does it say be good but especially to the household of faith not saying that you got to love them more or less hello but it's just special to have a brother and a sister that loves you and that you love and I believe we had evening night Tabernacle I believe for myself I need to love you more Brother Brad we need to love each other more everywhere you find it I'll love one another love one another children love one another because the devil wants you to hate one another Jesus never said that you know that you ought to bite and devour one another don't talk bad about each other don't tear each other down huh Paul said if you bite and devour one another be careful somebody might shoot somebody be careful that you'd be not consumed of each other to me that's what that means killing huh when you're fighting and fighting that's the devil in a church huh you talk about the love of God you know how many of the long suffering of God but Israel out of Egypt he loved them he brought them out and basically all God asked for is believe me and don't complain right believe me and don't complain complain I don't care if you come up against the Red Sea and you can't get around something can't get over it can't get around and you're in a box in a heart between a rock and a hard place God of fighting God anyway if you can't Praise Him for your present situation praise him for what he has done for you amen and he'll take care of your present situation look at where he brought you from this is where I get just a little excited because I'm telling you when I look down my path and I see everything in God has done for me I am he is worthy of praise and honor and worship I realize he has not be safe thus far and it's gonna be grace that takes me safely home it's gonna be Grace better and we're going to walk in that new body and then we're going to shout at him we're gonna lock the streets of gold but we're gonna worship Him cause he's starting to work he's gonna be able to finish it all because he loves you he loved you that made the difference you're the love The Sinner you're the love those that are mean to you and persecute you huh oh yeah I say unto you not like they said it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you might be my children so that you can be like I was folks that don't mean that you have love that's uncorrected Jesus had corrected love he told people when they were wrong and that's why they hated him so bad he even got straight enough he loved him enough to television got into my daddy's not your dad ain't the devilish your daddy you are your father the devil huh folks in this I'm a pastor sometimes can tell people you are on the wrong road you are going down the wrong path does that stop him not a bit people that are determined to head long road down the wrong road they're gonna go headlong down the road it doesn't matter how much it fails why I'll tell you what the grace of God will turn you around the grace of God get a big old stick on the backside of your backside yo who you feel good huh you'll be glad to run the other direction you'll be glad to get right thank you Jesus right how many fat for them real Whoopins come my way just take that tire on him oh my it hurts him but thank God for correction that means he loves you he loves you chasing concises he rebukes and Jason's thank God for his rebuke for the rebuke that the prophet bought oh you say you love God cut your hair wear make them wear pants you don't love God because if you'd love God you'd take them things off it quite Runners wearing that makeup and all of that stuff amen he corrected him didn't he he rebuked them but they still said nah don't go to them meetings I know Jesus is there and Discerning the thoughts and intents at heart and Vindicated don't you dare go there they knew they didn't say that but they knew it in their mind and they received not a love of the truth now they're going to go to hell thinking that speaking tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost right come on folks oh they kept speaking the tongues and so forth but they had put Christ out folks you got to be careful don't you put Christ out when you put his word out you put him out amen praise the Lord I like that when Divine love is protected and it seems like it comes to its and you've done all that you can do and hold still there's another there's another wheel that kicks in and it starts turning right about the Daniel about the time that they put it got up to that heat of the three fire Hebrew children got in the fire just about to come to that heat and it got hotter than the normal heat was from the outside the air conditioner come on teen and that was the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was God himself he come in there and he kept the two for him not all they killed but never walking down and I met to the fire there was a first man down there with her foreign man in your trials all right and we're in the midst of one right now there's a fiery tribe fiery tests that'll consume anybody that's not true seed hello it's the grace of God it's the love of God that holds you gotta get a little shop because I'm telling you right now you know that ain't nothing but the truth it's God's grace that holds you he's begun to work and he's holding you it's not you holding on to him oh thank God thanks be to God praise be the Lord amen all right I usually just have one page I got two I got three so hang on y'all don't worry though there's just three thoughts on one so it goes pretty fast praise the Lord you love him Ephesians 4 says that God gave some Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers for the imperfecting of the Saints now for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ how many desires for that to be new everybody here listen do you desire this morning to come to the stature of the fullness of Christ let me put simple terms that means letting God in every door of your heart every part of your life Jesus has to have control or you're not in the foods how many is not there and needs it be honest now this is kind of tricky but not there but needed that's right that's what I'm up here for that's my job is to challenge you to see whether you're where you ought to be and to give you the opportunity to get a little closer to Christ that moral cars come into your heart Jesus it's the sweetest name I know amen that you be henceforth no more children tossed to and fro carried about with everyone the doctor by the slide them in and by the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to disease amen back to other scripture that despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send us Reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the public is the same if you sleep only your brothers only in other words if you only love the Brotherhood and not those out there huh you're no different than as I always say the Harley games don't mess with the heart Harley dude especially Hell's Angels right even cops don't like to mess with them huh because you're daily they stick up for each other huh what was it but bam said why do people become gangsters because your mom didn't give him love Dad didn't give him love those gangs give him love so they joined the gangs to get a little love we ain't got to go to gangsters just come to Christ if you want to load the love of Christ and if you salute your brother and only what do you more than others do not even publicans the same Hallelujah no notice he says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect is not Christ identifying perfection in love that was a question now I want to say yes I believe it is don't you Christ identified love as being perfect that if you are perfect in love amen charity suffered long and His Kind charity envious not charity vaunted not itself it's not walked around how do they evolve let me see if I can I can't even walk but it don't walk like that that's Pride walking of somebody I'm somebody you walk like this wheat head bent over humble I'm nothing but dirt if God don't help me I can't do anything without him I can do nothing huh praise be to God humble meek amen that's right not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not our own living for others is what eternal life is isn't it how many believes that we got to look out for each other is not easily provoked think of No Evil Rejoice is not iniquity but rejoices in the truth Bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things wow charity never tell us folks anybody ever tell you well I tried to love that person and never loved him back it didn't work how don't you ever say that charity fails Bible says charity don't fail huh you failed to be long suffering you failed to be gentle you failed to bear and endure amen my but whether there be prophets they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge you shall vanish away for now we know in part and prophesying but when that which is perfect income is come then that which is in part shall be done away brother Brandon what would you rather have a bunch of tongue-speaking prophesying and knowing all Mysteries and all of that kind of a church or do you want one that is in love one with another and love the Lord he says I'll take the one that has a love amen notice now for now for when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child oh my just got to take a few minutes here is that all right every one of us including myself I look back at the days I fought I fussed huh we fuss with one another bigger acted like a bunch of children we wouldn't forgive each other huh held grudges [Music] well this person did this to me and I decided the other this out of the other still a child come on baby grow up there'll be plenty more to do that for you yeah you're gonna pull your hair out and get your gun out if you just keep letting people bother you like that you can't let people the world you can't be governed by how people do no sir listen to this this just comes to me do you realize being a son or a daughter of God that you're a minor Creator do you know that you create the atmosphere that you live in do you realize that the atmosphere that you dwell in you influence somebody else we're not to be influenced by the world you're not to be influenced by somebody out there uh you influenced them not them you boy you'll be in a bad shape if you let the world and those people influence you they'll take you the wrong direction amen all kinds of men the Son and Daughter of God you're the one that's influenced what makes people like do anything to do how many knows a lot of times but so many times people react to our action don't they when you get up and you say howdy to somebody how are you doing they might just say hi back hey me and my wife yo we go waving at people all the time some of them waving others won't and she's just that one didn't wave that one didn't wave well guess what one time I didn't wave and I said I was looking at my phone or something I was I I didn't realize wait I'm not mean uh I was just not paying attention but isn't it something but you talk to somebody that's harsh with you or a little upset with you this is a good lesson for us husbands and what huh use the same tone as your husband does use the same tone as your wife does to see where you get nowhere real fast but this is part of my message this is my party the Bible says that we ought to love our wives as Christ loved the church huh what have I got wrote down here something about uh uh oh that's what I even Paul said it Paul says that is uh uh a single person on us if you're single stay single because you're going to please the Lord and see how you can please the Lord but if you're married then the husband is going to see how he can please his wife and the wife she's married she's gonna see how she can please her husband I thought boy they would just if we would just do that more there'd be a lot less marriage problems huh if you tried to please each other make each other happy I thought about taking the time today hey I'm going hunting I got a happy wife I got a happy life ain't happy make sure your wife is happy for her amen and even Jesus said we we love our wives and why we love our husbands the way that the church says Christ a lot of problems will be solved how many knows the Bible said that love covers a longitude of sins love produces grace even the prophet says man if you if you don't like somebody you don't have any Grace for him you say anything bad about him that you can huh just like that person I was telling you about you go around and see how many other people they can turn against that person that they don't like of course they don't have no Grace they don't have no love it's not God it's a devil huh oh my but Lord help us to love each other and to love our husbands love our wives the way that God loved church and gave himself for it amen because that's the one thing that I will truly believe in the spiritual Realm even Paul said when he was talking about that he says I'm speak about Christ and the church even though he given natural type of it he says he was talking about the Christ and the church and if you love the Lord how many knows you're going to see how you can please him how many wants to be pleasing to the Lord amen it'll solve a whole lot of your problems your ifs and and commands and commandment this and law all that'll be taken care of if you just wanted to please the Lord amen how many believe that that's what divine love does just a couple more things how many knows a good example I really truly believe we're Divine love is projected Grace will take over brother Brandon one time he was out in the middle of that field and that killer bull that had killed a black man was out there in the middle there was no trees the fence was too far and he had left his gun on and it struck and here that thing comes up snorting his snorting his nose stomping them front feet and PAW and getting ready to come he says Oh my he reached for his gun he looked for the fence and looked for a tree he was a natural human being uh every one of us we looked for a tree look for a fence and gauge how fast we could run how fast uh he says I can't never make it he says Lord help me and begin the one place he says Lord help me to die don't let me be a coward and die not being a coward it's the way you are I'm gonna go I'm gonna get mauled by this fool but he began to let the Holy Spirit come over and begin to apologize to the bull huh how many knows two real genuine Holy Ghost love puts you in the other person's shoes your wife is upset about something do is something I've learned the hard way when she says something is upsets about something you have to listen to what she's saying put yourself in her shoes ah come on wives you know there's nothing better to hear from your husband yes okay I understand what you're saying you're right I let's do it this way or whatever huh go on you say Amen it's all right understand the same way with brothers or sisters or friends isn't that right A lot of times friendships are no more because they don't have a lack of understanding because there's a lack of love we don't have friends anymore people aren't scared to be friends anymore because we can be so sticky boy oh boy I didn't know where it is he's going but is it all right that's the truth isn't it well as human beings can be real selfish and sticky in mind folks I I am the kind of person you know that if I call you my friend I try to be your friend through thick and thin not just a fair weather friend I don't have much for people like that don't have much for them except for reaching out a little bit further you know don't be that way you'll do me wrong I'll do you wrong but we're gonna be friends because you know that's what we are amen anyway that's free this morning but that love that comes in there that putting yourself in somebody else's shoes amen all right well we're running pretty good schedule amen another place so you'd be you want to finish letting me finish the story again I don't care if I got to sit down and relax like you not fair y'all got them comfortable seats I got up here and working hard bull I apologize I realize that God has given you a nature to protect your territory and I am on your territory now your instinct is to get rid of your spot and that's what them Hoops are all going about two ton maybe one of them big bulls Brother John big bulls I don't know if you had horns or not didn't need anything to kill him if I would tell you on your turn now I gave you a nature but I'm here and I'm going to cross the field to pray for one of God's people I'm serving your daddy our daddy the one that made you made me all right and he said what what did Brother Brown say he says all of a sudden I didn't hate the bull I loved the bull I love the ball and then what happened that love that casts out fear has no fear has no torment he said I was no more afraid than nothing he wasn't afraid anymore that love had come down in this special way man and he says that bull perhaps started to come at him he says now turn around and go back and lay down huh that abandoned was comfortable he got done spoken here he comes charging him full speed Full Speed Ahead no red flags or stresses and tricks and jumping over him now got to get up for this that boob was coming and then all of a sudden you know how to do just come to my stop push them front claws into the ground you know how horse can do just come to a stop and this is me forgive me this is me better bad but brother Brandon says that the bull looked this way and he looked that way and he looked dumbfounded huh to me somebody got invisible somebody must have got invisible why is he looking around my brother Branham never said that that's why I say me but something like that huh where did that guy go oh hey God can transfer for Philip right from one meeting to the other he can do anything he wants to you know the bill bull could have just stood there and hissed and helped and stuff like that and kept trying to get him perhaps there was an angel with fire he ain't gonna get close to the fire but it wasn't that day he was looking around and walked around back back to his place and laid down says I wish I had that all the time but let me tell you something how my beliefs if you got Divine love in here and you love God God takes Grace takes over he did all he could do brother bam couldn't do any more the same way with Hornets a bunch of hornets when he bumped up against the Hornets with the lawnmower come up out of there he didn't have a shirt on the back yard a whole string of them coming at it huh he says I'm sorry I Disturbed you I was in a hurry and I know I disturb you I'm sorry I Disturbed you folks let's just remember this to everybody remember this sorry goes a long way for for covering transgressions sorry let's all say it let's all say it again sorry let's cut this out because in this world you're gonna need it you're gonna need that word keep your whole lot of bitterness out of your heart it'll make the next person happy it'll mend friendships get you and your wife back together you and your neighbor back together you and me back together amen sorry I apologize amenity apologized the Holy Spirit come down and they all went right back into the nests Amen Let me close with this better random went beyond the curtain of time and he says we all remember when he was caught up in his bed he was up there and he seen Millions he says I could feel them they hugged me the sisters would hug me everybody would hug me but there was no sensation no funny feeling no sensation at all it was all Perfect love just pure there was no there was no nothing nothing evil there at all now notice he says I could feel them felt their hands God is my judge just sick sacred book open here I could feel them just this way as I feel my hands and my face they're throwing your arms around me and I'll pass on everything is real brother and everything's real sister I like that let that be with us everything's real genuine brother here everything's real sister we have the love of God Among Us amen there's no death in the sorrow no jealousy no nothing nothing can enter there it's just perfection that's what I'm striving for that's what I'm placing for I believe this was about the prophet of God Amen Jesus Christ through his Prophet was trying to do and get to church I said oh Lord that's what I'm here at the church for trying to set the church in order telling you brother and sister there's only one thing that can enter there and that's perfect love not because you're loyal to random Tabernacle or should I say evening that Tabernacle or some Methodist Church or Baptist Church he says but friends not because you spoke in tongues or dance in the spirit not because you danced out Devils or moved mountains that's all right he says but still unless that real Perfection or love is in there amen then the next quote he says thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place would it be safe to say this morning that it'll take perfect love in your heart to get you into rapture it'll take perfect love in your heart I don't know there is I don't think there is but if there's anybody in here this morning that's got a little bitterness got anything like that this is the morning to take care of it this is when you see God I still have this little thing here that I hold or whatever I want it gone amen I hope none of you can raise your hand say I still got that hope every one of you amen is it the place to wear no matter what anybody does to you you don't hold grudges you don't hold bitterness I'm not saying you can't make it right go to and make it right and all that you can but never allow that bitterness to come in amen because that's not going to be in there amen and give you an example earlier of somebody that did and they thought they didn't have to forgive but that's not the Bible that's why they are so miserable because God was holding all their sins against them amen no matter how many religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that it'll take perfect love so whatever you do list out everything else until you're just so filled with the love of God till you can love those that hate you another place he says that till you can love those that would kill you if they kill you that's right that's right that would kill you love those then you're at the place where you need to be amen God bless you let's stand how many fields the Holy Spirit here how many feels the presence of Christ here this morning he's here that's him when you talk about him he always comes when you bring the truth and tell the truth on things he always is in that truth and
