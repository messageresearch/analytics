[40:53] realize lost God and believe truly that
[40:55] you'll take control of the service and
[40:57] that you'll have your way Lord and that
[40:59] you'll just take the word father that I
[41:01] feel you've quicked upon my heart to
[41:02] speak apply it to the people now in the
[41:04] name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen and
[41:08] amen let's turn our bibles if you will
[41:11] amen over to um one of them is going to
[41:15] be in second chronicles
[41:18] and the other one is going to be in
[41:21] the book of
[41:23] Luke
[41:28] amen so we'll go to the Book of Luke 17.
[41:45] verse 11 of Luke 17 verse 11 and he came
[41:49] to pass as he went to Jerusalem did he
[41:52] path through the midst of Samaria and
[41:54] Galilee
[41:56] a certain Village there met him 10 men
[42:00] that were lepers which stood afar off
[42:04] and they lifted up their voices and
[42:08] said Jesus Master have mercy on us and
[42:12] when he saw them he said unto them go
[42:14] show yourselves unto the priests and he
[42:16] came to pass as they went
[42:18] that
[42:19] they were cleansed boys glorified God
[42:22] and fell down on his face
[42:26] at his
[42:28] his feet giving him thanks and he was a
[42:30] Samaritan and Jesus answered
[42:34] and there were not found that
[42:37] that returned to give glory to God save
[42:39] this Stranger in second chronicles
[42:44] 29
[42:47] he was atturing the time of Hezekiah
[42:50] King being King and they were making an
[42:53] anatomy atonement for Israel amen making
[42:56] a lot of different sacrifices but in the
[42:58] 29th chapter of second chronicles
[43:10] and in verse 31 then Hezekiah
[43:14] hi out
[43:16] answered and said
[43:19] that now you have consecrated
[43:22] yourselves unto the Lord come near and
[43:26] bring thank offerings amen
[43:29] amen look at that word thank all priests
[43:31] into the house of the Lord and the
[43:34] congregation brought in sacrifices and
[43:37] thank offerings amen as many as were of
[43:41] a free heart burnt offerings may God
[43:44] that is blessed blessings to the reading
[43:47] of the word you can be seated amen amen
[43:53] foreign
[44:02] give thanks for this is the will of God
[44:05] in Christ Jesus concerning you in
[44:09] everything give thanks amen amen title
[44:13] tonight is thank you Lord
[44:15] thank you Lord
[44:18] amen but basically I'll be honest with
[44:21] you it's kind of a feeling amen it's
[44:24] kind of a feeling that I had and just
[44:25] the way that I
[44:27] felt
[44:30] amen and I begin to hurt
[44:33] and you know we're always asking God for
[44:35] more we're designing hiring things from
[44:38] him a lot we have a lot of needs that we
[44:40] have and get from him in that right
[44:42] amen man we need victories we need
[44:45] triumphs we need that we need
[44:46] encouragement we need all of this but so
[44:49] many times the things that when we come
[44:51] and they will approach almighty God it
[44:53] is with the request or a desire or
[44:55] asking for something but very few times
[44:58] do we have a service Amen to where our
[45:00] codal focus is on just thanking God
[45:05] just thanking him amen because I got to
[45:07] thinking when we get over there and when
[45:09] we get over to the other side you know
[45:11] and I like that song and boy I'll tell
[45:14] you when I begin to think about there's
[45:15] so many songs comes to mind and man I
[45:17] can only imagine what I will do amen
[45:19] when I stand before him you know under
[45:21] what will I do amen and so forth uh
[45:27] dance before you what will I
[45:29] figured you won't have to ask for more
[45:32] strength and uh to overcome this and
[45:35] overcome that but when you fall before
[45:38] him think about what you're gonna do
[45:41] and over in the Book of Revelations find
[45:43] that Thanksgiving is a part of worship
[45:46] isn't that right thanks
[45:48] giving is a part of worship so every
[45:50] time you thank God or you say Amen or
[45:54] you say hallelujah it's all praising God
[45:58] it's always thanking God now notice that
[46:00] thanks and praise go hand in hand
[46:05] not only thank him but praise him for
[46:07] his goodness so tonight I thought Ma
[46:10] I'll just put a list of things down and
[46:12] we'll go down through here and think
[46:13] about all the things that we can thank
[46:15] him for
[46:16] now the feeling like I said that I had
[46:18] you know and normally you don't go by
[46:20] feelings as far as preaching the word
[46:22] but as long as your feelings match the
[46:24] word I think it's okay amen and I
[46:26] thought you know God you have been so
[46:28] good to me now I'm in that song There's
[46:30] oh you have been oh so good to me that
[46:33] even a song that says that
[46:35] isn't that right how good God has been
[46:37] to you you know
[46:38] I thought you know what is what is your
[46:41] answer if I ask you tonight is how good
[46:44] has God been to you
[46:47] how good she been to you
[46:50] how good's he been to you
[46:52] you know and I think the correct answer
[46:54] that probably most of us would give
[46:56] would be better than I deserve
[47:05] he had been
[47:10] and when we get over there we're just
[47:12] gonna think I just wanna I just I'm
[47:14] gonna fall down before him and just
[47:16] thank him thank you Lord Jesus I don't
[47:18] ever have to have a prayer meeting
[47:19] anymore I don't have to never have uh
[47:22] you know
[47:24] ask for strength for this for that and
[47:26] the other be I won't have to never have
[47:28] a victory anymore because we've come
[47:30] past all of that now it's all in the
[47:31] past and for thousands of years we're
[47:34] just going to give him glory and honor
[47:35] and thanks
[47:36] the Bible talks about how that we're to
[47:38] give it he is God a great God and
[47:40] greatly to be praised
[47:43] before we go down the list I want to
[47:44] look at something that David said amen
[47:46] as we look at this it's in first
[47:49] Chronicles
[47:50] these
[47:52] things
[47:53] when I begin to think about it this this
[47:57] message so I thought about that song and
[47:59] I just wanna thank you Lord
[48:03] you know forget it I just wanna thank
[48:06] you Lord
[48:07] for letting me hear your word
[48:10] how many Clap That
[48:14] amen what have I done to deserve such
[48:17] Glory that's revealed in me amen I just
[48:20] wanna thank you Lord God it's so good
[48:22] sometimes until all I want to do all I
[48:24] want to do is love him
[48:26] amen all I want to do is praise you
[48:29] praise him praise him in the morning
[48:31] praise him in the noon died Praise Him
[48:33] in the evening praise him till the sun
[48:35] goes down
[48:37] amen now notice what David says then on
[48:41] that day David delivered first this
[48:43] Psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of
[48:47] Asif and his Brethren give thanks unto
[48:50] the Lord call upon his name make known
[48:54] his deeds among the people in other
[48:57] words that's what we do here at church
[48:59] isn't it we talk about his deeds the
[49:01] great Deeds of stopping the Sun and the
[49:04] Moon a man of taking the Lions and and
[49:07] bears and killing them and goliathus
[49:10] that gets lained in front of his
[49:11] children
[49:12] amen these great Deeds that God does
[49:16] amen make known his deeds give thanks
[49:20] unto the Lord amen sing unto him sing
[49:23] Psalms unto him taught me of all of his
[49:27] wondrous works
[49:29] amen over in verse 23 it says Sing unto
[49:32] the Lord
[49:34] Earth show forth from day to day his
[49:37] salvation
[49:40] amen declare his glory among the Heath
[49:44] then and his serverless Works among all
[49:48] nations for great is urgent and amen
[49:52] also to be feared above all gods for all
[49:57] the gods of the people are Idols but the
[50:00] Lord made the heavens Glory and Honor
[50:03] are in his presence strength and Badness

[57:08] of reasons we want to look at some of
[57:11] those some of those reasons why we want
[57:13] to thank him amen one of the first
[57:16] things that I thought about was that
