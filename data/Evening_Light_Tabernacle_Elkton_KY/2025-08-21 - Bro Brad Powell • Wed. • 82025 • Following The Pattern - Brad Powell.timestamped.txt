[50:34] Amen.
[50:36] We certainly serve a great and mighty
[50:38] God tonight.
[50:40] I tell you what, it's just it's good to
[50:42] be a Christian.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; It's good to be a believer. that you
[50:46] know the difference between the false
[50:48] and the truth.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; And it's it's just good to know where
[50:52] you stand in this late hour that we're
[50:54] living in. And and that we've been given
[50:56] a a a way and a direction and a path.
[51:00] And we're going to speak on some of that
[51:01] tonight. And we're going to look at some
[51:03] thoughts in through our church age book.
[51:05] We're going to take a thought uh
[51:07] following the pattern. following the
[51:10] pattern. And uh so and looking at that
[51:13] and and uh as you're turning into your
[51:16] Bibles, if you want to turn to 1
[51:18] Chronicles chapter 28,
[51:22] we'll get into the word here. Let me get
[51:25] things started up here. We don't want to
[51:27] try to hold you long tonight, but uh we
[51:31] know it's been a been a long week, I'm
[51:34] sure, for everybody. And and you're
[51:36] tired. How many's tired? Just be honest.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Some of us are tired and
[51:44] uh but how many can set aside about 50
[51:46] minutes to
[51:48] &gt;&gt; for the for the word of the Lord? Amen.
[51:51] I think I heard them mention in the
[51:53] prayer, but we do want to remember
[51:54] before we go into the words tonight.
[51:57] remember Amber Amber Golden and Anora in
[52:00] a special way and just a just a real
[52:03] tragic event and and that had taken
[52:06] place and you know you don't understand.
[52:08] I talked to brother Joseph and called
[52:10] him and talked to him and he said you
[52:12] know sometimes the way of the Lord just
[52:14] breaks your heart
[52:22] and we know they're heartbroken
[52:24] and our heart breaks with them. So,
[52:26] we'll remember them in a in a special
[52:28] way. They've been friends of ours for
[52:32] for years and
[52:34] we were planning to go out with them
[52:36] this weekend and after the meeting and
[52:38] have a little little snack and and we
[52:41] setting those arrangements up and life
[52:44] changes. You know, things things have a
[52:47] way of changing. You don't know what
[52:49] tomorrow holds.
[52:51] And so, uh, just remember them in your
[52:54] prayers in a special way. So, uh, read
[52:57] this little quote here as we get started
[52:59] and before we get into our scripture.
[53:01] And brother Random's speaking now. And
[53:03] he's he's speaking here in the in the
[53:05] when he preaches the Ephesian church.
[53:07] And he's speaking and he said, "Each one
[53:09] of these churches according to scripture
[53:12] here had an angel." And now this is the
[53:14] foundation part of the foundation of
[53:16] what we believe and why we believe what
[53:18] we believe. Because you won't find a lot
[53:20] of this in denominational teaching. You
[53:22] won't find this in in in in a lot of the
[53:25] seminaries. You won't find the church
[53:27] ages, the seven se. You won't find these
[53:30] preached this way. And he says now he
[53:33] each age that according to the scripture
[53:35] had an angel. And the angel how many
[53:37] knows is a messenger. That's a
[53:39] messenger. Yes, it is. There were seven
[53:41] angels to the seven church ages. It
[53:44] meant seven messengers. We see it in the
[53:47] board here. And so he says these were
[53:50] the seven stars that was to reflect the
[53:52] light of his presence in the day of
[53:55] night in the in the day of night that
[53:57] we're living in. As the stars reflect
[54:00] the sun to the earth, it makes it light
[54:02] so we can walk and get around at
[54:05] nighttime. So no matter how dark this
[54:08] hour gets, no matter how dreary it
[54:10] seems, no matter how dismal it may feel
[54:13] in our lives around us, as we see the
[54:15] world falling apart and becoming darker
[54:18] and darker, there is a light.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; We've had a message that shed the light
[54:23] upon the hour that we're living in and
[54:26] tells you who you are. So we got a lot
[54:28] to be thankful for. He says, "Now we
[54:30] find out then that during this time each
[54:32] one of those angels had a position and a
[54:35] place." He says, "And brethren, tonight
[54:38] we don't we don't get to it because we
[54:41] know the angel of the first age, but
[54:42] it's going to be a mysterious, glorious
[54:44] thing to find and pull out of history
[54:47] before you, the angels of these other
[54:50] churches." The angel of the first church
[54:53] was St. Paul.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Now, watch what he says. He founded it.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; There's a foundation there.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; We look at the word and we look at the
[55:04] the stature of the perfect man. We look
[55:06] at the way this is laid out. There's a
[55:07] foundation there that Paul built the
[55:10] word upon. He took the word and built
[55:11] this foundation that we could stand on.
[55:14] That we don't have to stand on shifting
[55:16] sands that the winds of life will not
[55:18] prevail against us because we've been
[55:20] given a firm foundation built by the
[55:23] founder of Paul.
[55:30] He said, "Yes, sir." He founded it. It's
[55:32] He's God's messenger. The angel of the
[55:35] church of Ephesus was St. Paul. Now, he
[55:38] said there there may be these that might
[55:39] disagree, but I've sat there for days
[55:43] and days under inspiration till I felt
[55:46] the Holy Spirit strike me and anoint me
[55:49] for this. That's the reason I know.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I know. And I watched
[55:58] these men that have been picked. He's
[56:00] talking about Paul, Ireanius, Martin,
[56:03] Columbus, Luther, Wesley himself. I've
[56:07] watched these men that have been picked.
[56:10] He said, if you're in a historian, the
[56:12] same man that I have got here, you know
[56:15] by Revelation that they was the angels
[56:17] to the church. Watch what he says now.
[56:20] And they had the same ministry that
[56:24] these did at the beginning.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; The same ministry. Every one of those
[56:30] had the same ministry that they did on
[56:33] the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[56:35] Spirit fell.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; And that ministry cannot change.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; It must. He says it must. Not it might,
[56:46] not it could, not maybe, but it must
[56:49] stay Pentecost all the way through.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing a pattern?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing a pattern as we're
[56:58] talking about a pattern? And I liked how
[57:00] he said it must stay Pentecost. He
[57:02] didn't say Pentecostal.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; How many Pentecostal people were in his
[57:08] meetings in and out and in and out? He
[57:10] he wasn't telling them, "Hey, you need
[57:11] to stay the way you are." He said, "You
[57:13] need to go back to the way it was."
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Not a Pentecostal experience the way
[57:19] they have it nowadays or the way it was
[57:21] in the churches that he was against
[57:24] preaching against. But let's go back to
[57:26] Pentecost like it was when the the Holy
[57:29] Ghost fell and Paul took the word and
[57:31] built this foundation that we stand
[57:33] upon.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles 28. Now, I'm going to try
[57:37] to preach this in a way I told my wife,
[57:39] I said, I'm preaching something tonight
[57:41] that I've never seen tied like this in
[57:43] the message, but by God's grace,
[57:46] we'll we'll tie it together, and I trust
[57:48] that it's a blessing to you the way it
[57:50] blessed me when it came to us. So um 1
[57:54] Chronicles
[57:56] 28 11
[57:59] then David gave to Solomon his son the
[58:03] pattern of the porch and of the houses
[58:06] thereof and of the treasures thereof and
[58:08] of the upper chambers thereof and of the
[58:10] inner parlors thereof and of the place
[58:12] of the mercy seat and the pattern of all
[58:18] that he had by the spirit of the courts
[58:20] of the house of the Lord and of all all
[58:22] the chambers around and the treasuries
[58:24] of the house of the of God and the
[58:27] treasuries of dedicated things also for
[58:31] the courses of the priests and the
[58:33] Levites and for all the work and of the
[58:35] service of the house of the Lord and for
[58:36] all the vessels of service in the house
[58:39] of the Lord.
[58:41] Do you see what's happening here? God is
[58:43] being very specific in what he's what
[58:45] he's doing. He says he gave gold by
[58:48] weight of the things of gold of
[58:49] instruments of all manner of service.
[58:51] Silver also for the instruments of
[58:53] silver by weight for all instruments of
[58:56] every kind of service. Even now I like
[58:59] how that's put in there because it's
[59:00] telling us that he is mindful of the
[59:03] little things.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; He's mindful of the little things in
[59:06] your life and my life and our kids'
[59:08] lives. He's mindful of the little
[59:10] things. the way we live our life. He's
[59:12] mindful because he says even the weight
[59:15] of the candlesticks of gold and for
[59:17] their lamps of gold by the weight of
[59:19] every candlestick and for the lamps
[59:21] thereof and for the candlesticks of
[59:23] silver by weight both for the
[59:25] candlestick and for the lamps thereof
[59:27] according to the use of every
[59:29] candlestick.
[59:31] And by weight he gave gold for the
[59:33] tables of sha uh of showbread for every
[59:36] table. And likewise silver for the table
[59:38] of silver also pure gold for the flesh
[59:41] hooks and the and the bowls and the cups
[59:43] and for the golden basin and for the
[59:45] gold by weight for every basin. And
[59:48] likewise silver by weight of every basin
[59:51] of silver.
[59:54] This is specific. God is building a
[59:57] house. He's building a tabernacle. He's
[59:58] building He's building something that he
[1:00:00] has revealed to David. And now David is
[1:00:03] telling Solomon and this is very
[1:00:04] specific. We have to live a very
[1:00:07] specific kind of life.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; As believers, you're set aside and
[1:00:11] pulled apart separate and different than
[1:00:14] the denominations, different than the
[1:00:16] systems, different than those around.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says in verse 18. for the
[1:00:23] altar of incense of refined gold and
[1:00:25] gold for the pattern of the chariot of a
[1:00:29] chariot of the cherubams that spread out
[1:00:31] their wings and covered the ark of the
[1:00:33] covenant. All this said David, the Lord
[1:00:37] made me understand in writing by his
[1:00:40] hand upon me.
[1:00:43] Now there's a key part of this
[1:00:44] scripture. The Lord made me understand
[1:00:47] in writing by his hand upon me
[1:00:51] even all the works of this pattern. So
[1:00:54] God let David understand as he come down
[1:00:58] and he laid his hands upon him. He said,
[1:00:59] "This is the way that it's going to be.
[1:01:01] This is the way the tabernacle of the
[1:01:03] house of God has to be built."
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He gave a message to a messenger.
[1:01:13] And David said unto Solomon his son, "Be
[1:01:16] strong and of good courage and do it.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Do it."
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; What the message says, do it.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Don't do it with fear. Don't give into
[1:01:30] the temptation, but build the temple,
[1:01:32] the house of God, a place for God to
[1:01:35] rest in. Do it. If the message of the
[1:01:38] hour were to tell us anything in this
[1:01:40] day, what would it say? Follow the
[1:01:42] message and build yourself a tabernacle
[1:01:45] that God can dwell in.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Do it without fear.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Fear not, nor be dismayed. For the Lord
[1:01:53] God, even my God, will be with thee. He
[1:01:56] will not fail thee, nor forsake thee
[1:01:58] until thou hast finished the work for
[1:02:00] the service of the house of the Lord.
[1:02:02] You can have your seats tonight. May the
[1:02:04] Lord add his blessings to the reading of
[1:02:05] the word.
[1:02:11] So brothers and sisters, we see here
[1:02:12] that God has a pattern and a plan for
[1:02:16] each and every one of us in this hour
[1:02:18] that we're living in. So let me ask you
[1:02:21] tonight,
[1:02:22] is your house of God, is your house a
[1:02:27] place of rest to where God can come and
[1:02:30] rest in the hour that we're living in?
[1:02:32] Is this vessel
[1:02:35] Yes.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; A place of rest.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Because God was telling David, we have
[1:02:41] to have a place of rest. Now, this had
[1:02:44] been on David's heart for quite some
[1:02:46] time. And I I'm going to tell the story
[1:02:47] and rehearse it a little bit, but I want
[1:02:49] you to understand and see here that
[1:02:51] David at this point had called together
[1:02:55] all the elders. And he had called and
[1:02:57] assembled all the people, all the
[1:02:59] leaders of Jerusalem. The word says that
[1:03:01] he had called in the prince of Israel,
[1:03:03] the princes of tribes, men who were
[1:03:05] captains of thousands, men who were
[1:03:08] captains of hundreds, men who were who
[1:03:10] were who were uh uh stewards over the
[1:03:13] substance and the possessions that he
[1:03:15] had. They knew his he called in his
[1:03:17] sons. He called in officers. He's called
[1:03:19] in all these mighty men and valor of
[1:03:23] Jerusalem. And David is here at the and
[1:03:26] we see that he's very well stricken in
[1:03:28] agent. He knows that his time on earth
[1:03:30] is just about over. But God has laid it
[1:03:33] on his heart that he should build a
[1:03:35] tabernacle, a house where God can dwell.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for messengers
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; that God could use and come down through
[1:03:46] the ages, through the church ages, and
[1:03:48] and begin to build a house?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And so, here is David now, well stricken
[1:03:57] in age. And I want you to watch what he
[1:03:59] does. David stands up to his feet in
[1:04:02] front of all of these people and he
[1:04:04] says, "Hear me,
[1:04:07] the voice."
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; The voice for the hour.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hear me.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Are y'all awake?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; We've had a voice in this hour.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; We've had a voice that called out and
[1:04:24] said, "Hear me.
[1:04:27] come out of her my people.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; But David says, "Hear me, my brethren,
[1:04:33] for my heart has built in my heart, God
[1:04:37] has wanted me to build a house of rest
[1:04:40] for the ark of the covenant of the
[1:04:42] Lord."
[1:04:44] Now, we all familiar with the ark of the
[1:04:46] covenant. We're we're familiar with what
[1:04:48] the ark of the covenant is. And we look
[1:04:50] at this ark and we begin to see and we
[1:04:52] know that it's it's made out of wood and
[1:04:54] it's a special kind of wood. and uh and
[1:04:57] it's overlaid with gold and this ark has
[1:05:00] a gold lid and it's got the two winged
[1:05:02] cherubams that's that's facing one
[1:05:04] another and they're looking at each
[1:05:05] other and inside this ark there is the
[1:05:09] the tablets that had the ten
[1:05:11] commandments scribed upon it and in this
[1:05:13] ark there is a golden jar of mana from
[1:05:16] when they wandered in the wilderness the
[1:05:19] bread of life is still in the ark
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; and in this ark there's also the Aaron's
[1:05:24] staff that budded in the presence.
[1:05:27] There's life in the ark. But what is the
[1:05:30] function of the ark? Why is it so
[1:05:32] important that this big huge house of
[1:05:34] God and this temple and tabernacle that
[1:05:37] is going to house the ark of the
[1:05:38] covenant? What is so significant? It's
[1:05:41] because that ark of the covenant is a
[1:05:44] symbol symbol symbolic representation of
[1:05:47] God's presence with Israel.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's building a house. Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He's building a house. He started
[1:05:56] building a house and he's continued to
[1:05:58] build and build and build upon the word
[1:06:01] and the word and it grows and it grows
[1:06:04] and every little bit we get down through
[1:06:06] time, man has progressed in the word of
[1:06:09] God
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; to know what God wants out of us,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; the life that we should be living.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; A place that he can house himself.
[1:06:23] an ark and the covenant in the hearts of
[1:06:26] the believers.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; This is this is not for everybody.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; But here is David. Here's David. And and
[1:06:35] here we see this this uh this temple
[1:06:37] that David is beginning to build. Uh
[1:06:40] this this temple, we can look at it as
[1:06:43] this is our our temple. This is our
[1:06:44] house of clay. And we look at this and
[1:06:47] David begins to spread the message.
[1:06:57] There was a day that came
[1:07:00] where there was a message that was
[1:07:02] spread.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; There was a proclamation that went out.
[1:07:07] There was a voice that shouted
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; in this last age that we're living in.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And that voice called out a commission.
[1:07:15] Now, David knew himself that he could
[1:07:18] not build this house.
[1:07:20] David knew he couldn't build it because
[1:07:22] God had told him, "David, this is not
[1:07:24] for you to do because you are a man of
[1:07:25] war. You have shed blood after blood.
[1:07:28] You are a warrior.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; But I will choose your son Solomon.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; I will choose your son Solomon to build
[1:07:36] the house of God in this hour." You know
[1:07:38] the name Solomon means peaceful. It
[1:07:41] means wisdom. It means prosperity. It
[1:07:44] comes from the root word shalom which
[1:07:47] means peace.
[1:07:50] So now he has chosen the man for the
[1:07:52] hour. Sometimes, listen now, sometimes
[1:07:55] we get to preaching on this stuff. We
[1:07:57] get to preaching on this. We get to
[1:07:58] preaching on the the messengers. We get
[1:08:00] to preaching on church ages and the
[1:08:02] seals. And we get to preaching on all
[1:08:04] this. And then all of a sudden, we we we
[1:08:06] we preach about angels sent from God to
[1:08:09] reveal and open the word. And people
[1:08:11] begin to back up
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; and be people begin to clam up and
[1:08:15] people just can't believe it.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; They get so skeptical because of what we
[1:08:20] believe in this hour.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; They get so afraid and so skeptical and
[1:08:25] they begin to throw up the guard and
[1:08:26] they say, "What? You're following a man?
[1:08:33] Look at the pattern.
[1:08:38] Look at the pattern.
[1:08:40] Moses was a man.
[1:08:47] David was a man.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, they
[1:08:53] were men.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Paul was a man.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; So, yes, I can agree with them when they
[1:08:59] say that. Yes, because they fail to take
[1:09:01] it back to the pattern. I see the
[1:09:03] pattern. And I say, "Yes, you're exactly
[1:09:05] right. I am following." Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, some of you want a cloud, but you
[1:09:11] held back.
[1:09:13] I'm following a son of man who is
[1:09:15] revealing the son of man.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; It's the message in the hour, the voice
[1:09:20] that goes forth that tells us what God
[1:09:22] is expected in this hour
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; and what kind of people we will be as
[1:09:26] believers.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Now, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:09:33] that God doesn't change.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; How many believes that? We've
[1:09:36] established that God does not change.
[1:09:40] Because if God changed his ways then and
[1:09:44] the things and the way he does things,
[1:09:45] then he wouldn't be God.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine trying to have
[1:09:50] confidence in a God that changes the way
[1:09:52] he does stuff?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; How could you have confidence in your
[1:09:55] healing knowing that God might change
[1:09:57] the way he does it? How could you have
[1:10:00] confidence in and knowing that you could
[1:10:01] be an overcomer if he changes it from
[1:10:03] one person to the next of what it takes
[1:10:05] to be an overcomer?
[1:10:08] How could you have confidence in God and
[1:10:11] and and and the power and demonstration
[1:10:13] of the word if he changes all the time?
[1:10:15] How could you even have confidence in
[1:10:17] salvation?
[1:10:19] If this person's salvation came this way
[1:10:21] and this person's came this way and this
[1:10:23] person's this way, you would think, my
[1:10:24] Lord, how was mine going to come? But
[1:10:27] there was one way that salvation came
[1:10:29] and it was the cross of Calvary.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't change. So if he doesn't
[1:10:36] change, there has to be a what? Pattern.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; A pattern. And this pattern begins to
[1:10:44] come down and begin to see, brothers and
[1:10:46] sisters, David had been given a pattern
[1:10:48] to follow for this building of the
[1:10:50] temple of the Lord. He'd been given a
[1:10:52] pattern. And God showed him exactly what
[1:10:55] it was that was to be built in order for
[1:10:58] the house of the treasures of God to be
[1:11:01] housed inside of it. In order for the
[1:11:03] presence of God to dwell in there, this
[1:11:06] house had to be built to God's exact
[1:11:08] specifications. Do you see why the
[1:11:10] message of the hour is so detailed?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; It's so detailed
[1:11:23] most can't follow it.
[1:11:27] That's why the word says the the message
[1:11:29] of the hour says it will be an elite
[1:11:31] group of people.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Well, you're just lifting
[1:11:35] yourself up. You think you're better." I
[1:11:36] don't think I'm better than anybody
[1:11:37] else.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; But I am going to try to live and I'm
[1:11:41] going to try to do exactly what that
[1:11:43] word says
[1:11:45] and I'm not going to deviate.
[1:11:48] I was watching I seen a clip the other
[1:11:50] day and this this Pentecostal woman I
[1:11:52] probably what I'm just going to tell you
[1:11:54] she this Pentecostal woman was talking
[1:11:56] about how she was uh uh always wears her
[1:11:59] skirts and and then she was in a clip
[1:12:01] where she didn't have on a skirt because
[1:12:03] she was out playing with her kids and
[1:12:04] she was in shorts and she was at the
[1:12:06] beach and she was in shorts or a bathing
[1:12:09] suit and she got on there trying to
[1:12:11] defend herself.
[1:12:16] She tried to defend herself.
[1:12:19] She said, "Yeah, people say I that I'm
[1:12:21] not a true Pentecostal. I'm not true
[1:12:23] Pentecostal because I had on a pair of
[1:12:25] shorts." Well, you take it for what you
[1:12:27] want.
[1:12:31] You take it for what you want. Why would
[1:12:34] she have to defend herself?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Why would she have to make an excuse for
[1:12:38] the way she was dressed?
[1:12:40] You see, we've been given such detailed
[1:12:43] way of life
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; that it couldn't be off just a little
[1:12:48] bit.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; It either is or it ain't.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I've said that a lot here lately. But
[1:12:55] when we get into the word, we say that
[1:12:57] we we either live by the word or we
[1:12:59] don't. She had to try to find a way to
[1:13:02] defend herself. Well, I was out playing
[1:13:04] in the yard with my kids.
[1:13:06] You can't do that in modest apparel,
[1:13:11] man. Y'all quiet.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It's the truth whether we like it or
[1:13:16] not.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; But in the presence of God,
[1:13:25] when God's going to come down and dwell,
[1:13:28] there's no deviation.
[1:13:30] So David had a specific order. the way
[1:13:33] things were supposed to be. It had to
[1:13:35] line up perfectly. The furniture had to
[1:13:37] be lined up just perfectly. The
[1:13:39] candlesticks had to be weighed and
[1:13:41] measured and they had to just weigh just
[1:13:43] a certain amount and they had to be put
[1:13:44] in a certain place. The lamps, the
[1:13:47] lampstands, the tables, the the the the
[1:13:49] the flesh hooks, the showbread, uh the
[1:13:51] basins, the table for the showbread. All
[1:13:54] of this had to be in a specific way that
[1:13:56] God wanted. Now, I want you to watch.
[1:13:58] This was not David's idea.
[1:14:02] David could never go in there and say,
[1:14:03] "You know what? I think if we build the
[1:14:05] temple this way, God will be happy."
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; You know, I think if I just go and I
[1:14:10] give away a lot of money and and and I
[1:14:12] can do all of this and I can help people
[1:14:14] all around the world and I can live any
[1:14:16] way I want and I think God will be
[1:14:17] happy.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Do you see how that don't work?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; It don't work that way. You You can give
[1:14:24] and you can give and you can give, but
[1:14:25] until you give yourself away,
[1:14:33] So David couldn't go in there and he
[1:14:35] could say, "Oh, I want to build this way
[1:14:36] or I want to put this over here or that
[1:14:38] over there." No, he couldn't do that.
[1:14:40] That's not the way it was.
[1:14:43] And David clearly told him, "This is not
[1:14:47] me."
[1:14:48] Have you ever noticed how the messenger
[1:14:50] of the hour always says, "This is not
[1:14:52] me.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; This is not me. This is God." And people
[1:14:59] say, 'Well, anybody could say that. But
[1:15:01] David says this. He says it, he made me
[1:15:04] understand by putting his hand upon me
[1:15:06] that all of the works of this pattern
[1:15:08] were true.
[1:15:11] David didn't want the respon. Can you
[1:15:13] imagine having that responsibility
[1:15:17] to what what if God said, "I want you to
[1:15:19] build me a house that's pleasing to me."
[1:15:22] And he gave you zero instruction.
[1:15:25] Where would you start?
[1:15:28] Where would you start? As a 16-year-old,
[1:15:31] as a teenager, how old are you?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; You had to think about it.
[1:15:37] 13 years old. As a teenager, what if God
[1:15:40] said, "I want a place to live in your
[1:15:41] heart, but he gave you no instructions
[1:15:43] of how to get there." As a 13y old, what
[1:15:46] would you think? Well, if I do this, if
[1:15:49] I do that, if I go here, if I do that,
[1:15:50] I'll be okay. No. But God has laid it
[1:15:53] out step by step instruction guide
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; to the be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And the thing about it is is the the
[1:16:03] bride accepts it.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; The bride reads it. They hear it. They
[1:16:08] take it in and they say, "Oh, I I can
[1:16:10] see myself in the word. I can see myself
[1:16:14] growing in God's plan. I can see myself
[1:16:17] at the pent day of Pentecost because I'm
[1:16:20] doing the same things that they did.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon preached the first
[1:16:32] seal. And I like how this this all comes
[1:16:35] together right here when I think about
[1:16:36] this and what David said, how God laid
[1:16:38] his hand upon him and wrote down and and
[1:16:40] God told him exactly what to do. Brother
[1:16:43] Brandham's preaching in the first seal.
[1:16:44] He said, "You see, the book actually was
[1:16:47] planned and written before the
[1:16:48] foundation of the world.
[1:16:52] Before anybody picked up an ink pen, the
[1:16:54] entire book was written."
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "This book, the Bible, was
[1:17:01] written before the foundation of the
[1:17:02] world." So God has no surprises.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; God only has mouthpieces
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; and lives lived.
[1:17:14] and lives that were documented to live
[1:17:17] just exactly the way he said it would be
[1:17:21] before the first pen took to paper.
[1:17:26] And so here he is now. He says, "Christ
[1:17:28] being the lamb was slain before the
[1:17:30] foundation and the members of his bride,
[1:17:33] their names were put in the lamb's book
[1:17:34] of life before the foundation of the
[1:17:37] world."
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; So he knew you would accept this.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; He knew you would follow the pattern. He
[1:17:44] knew you would walk in line and line up
[1:17:46] with the word upon word upon word.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, listen to this. This is
[1:17:55] the part I wanted to get to talking
[1:17:57] about David and how God had to tell
[1:17:59] David exactly the pattern to follow."
[1:18:03] Brother Random's in the preaching on the
[1:18:05] first seal and he says, "I would have
[1:18:07] had a horrible mistake.
[1:18:13] If it had not been about 12:00 today
[1:18:15] when the Holy Spirit came into the room
[1:18:17] and corrected me on something,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; he had preached on the seals before. He
[1:18:25] had studied the seals before. He had
[1:18:27] studied the seals uh uh through through
[1:18:30] a Dr. Smith
[1:18:33] And he was looking at it again and he
[1:18:35] said, "I was looking at this again." And
[1:18:37] he said, "But the Holy Spirit came into
[1:18:39] the room and corrected me on something
[1:18:40] that I was writing down to say." He
[1:18:44] said, "I was taking it from an old
[1:18:46] context and it had no and I had nothing
[1:18:48] on it. I don't know what the second seal
[1:18:51] is no more than nothing."
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; He's preaching a series on the seals
[1:18:56] that's going to be the revelation of the
[1:18:58] message of the hour to the bride of
[1:19:00] Jesus Christ. And he says in his own
[1:19:02] words, "I don't know what the second
[1:19:04] seal is no more than nothing.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; And I was going to preach the first one
[1:19:08] wrong, but the angel of the Lord come
[1:19:11] into the room and the Holy Ghost said,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; "That's not right."
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was you in the mind of
[1:19:19] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:19:21] world. If he would have spoke that
[1:19:22] wrong, where would we be today?
[1:19:25] But the angel, the Holy Ghost come into
[1:19:28] the room and spoke to him and brought it
[1:19:30] in together. And he said, but I had got
[1:19:32] some old context and I had gathered the
[1:19:34] context from this Dr. Smith, an
[1:19:36] outstanding teacher. And and they all
[1:19:39] believed it that way. So I had it wrote
[1:19:41] down and I was fixing to say it and
[1:19:44] study it from that standpoint until
[1:19:46] about 12:00 in the day, the Holy Spirit
[1:19:48] just swept through the room and the
[1:19:49] whole thing opened up to me. Yeah,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; the pattern opened up to him.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; The start of the first seal. He said
[1:20:00] that there it was the first seal being
[1:20:03] opened.
[1:20:05] And he said, "I'm as positive. I'm as
[1:20:08] positive as I'm standing here tonight
[1:20:10] that this is the gospel truth that I'm
[1:20:12] going to say here. I know it is."
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; He wasn't trying to convince you of
[1:20:19] something he believed.
[1:20:22] It was God moving on the scene. So, can
[1:20:24] you see, brothers and sisters, how
[1:20:26] important it is that we follow the word
[1:20:29] upon word and the message of the hour to
[1:20:31] a tea?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; We don't have room. We don't have time
[1:20:35] in the hour we're living in to make
[1:20:38] excuses, to make other ways,
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; to take detours.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; You know what a detour is? It takes you
[1:20:45] off route and it burns precious time.
[1:20:50] We don't need detours, brother Bo. We
[1:20:52] need to go straight there. We need a
[1:20:53] route that gets us to where we want to
[1:20:55] go.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; So, if he had to be corrected by the
[1:21:02] word, by the Holy Ghost, what does that
[1:21:05] say for us?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; What does that say for us when we begin
[1:21:09] to deviate and we get a little off here,
[1:21:11] a little off there
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; in this hour we're living? He says,
[1:21:16] listen at this. This is in the junction
[1:21:18] of time. And knowing that we're in the
[1:21:20] jun at the junction of time, the end
[1:21:22] time of the world, and we're weighed in
[1:21:25] the balance and found wanting.
[1:21:27] There's many maybe around the world. Yet
[1:21:30] today, millions and millions of people
[1:21:32] who doesn't believe that you're the
[1:21:35] same, that he's the same yesterday,
[1:21:36] today, and forever.
[1:21:40] And they have a form of godliness.
[1:21:45] and they're denying the power of your
[1:21:48] word. And yet you're sway they're
[1:21:51] swaying thousands of poor children into
[1:21:54] eternity without hope.
[1:22:00] What a blessing we have.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; What a blessing we have that God thought
[1:22:04] enough of us to lay out a guide
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; that we don't have to wander anymore and
[1:22:11] wonder is it this way or is it that way?
[1:22:15] He says, listen to this. He said,
[1:22:16] they're they're leading the poor
[1:22:17] children into eternity without hope,
[1:22:19] without God, and lost with their social
[1:22:22] things about believing,
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; social.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; What hour are we living in?
[1:22:35] Social media.
[1:22:39] Social life.
[1:22:43] Everybody wants to be a part of
[1:22:44] everybody.
[1:22:46] Everybody wants to know everybody. Well,
[1:22:48] how many followers can we get?
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; How many people's keeping up with us?
[1:22:55] How many people know who we are? How
[1:22:56] many people I want to be the social?
[1:22:58] God's not looking for social
[1:22:59] butterflies.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; But he's what he is saying that they
[1:23:03] begin to get so social in their way of
[1:23:06] living.
[1:23:07] Parties became prominent. Music became
[1:23:11] prominent.
[1:23:13] Rock and roll came on the scene.
[1:23:16] New drugs came on the scene that were
[1:23:19] social drugs
[1:23:21] that led to social diseases.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; They began to get so social on things.
[1:23:31] He said, "You said they would have a
[1:23:33] form of godliness that they would belong
[1:23:35] to churches.
[1:23:42] I know Sunday school teachers that teach
[1:23:45] Sunday school
[1:23:48] and and and party like who wouldn't have
[1:23:51] it on Saturday night before they get
[1:23:53] there.
[1:23:58] We won't call any names or
[1:23:59] denominations. We'll just leave it at
[1:24:01] that. But is that the person you want
[1:24:03] teaching your kids Sunday school?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I want somebody that's following the
[1:24:08] pattern.
[1:24:10] Are they perfect? No, we're not perfect.
[1:24:13] But are they trying? Are they following
[1:24:14] a pattern? Are they laying out a
[1:24:16] guideline that teaches our kids?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Sure they are. That's what we want. We
[1:24:21] want people that that follow the
[1:24:23] guidelines having a form of godliness.
[1:24:25] They would belong to churches. They
[1:24:26] would have rituals.
[1:24:28] They would be baptized in many ways and
[1:24:30] other things and forms and study
[1:24:32] catechisms and taking in church papers
[1:24:34] and form of godliness and denying the
[1:24:37] power thereof. the power give to give a
[1:24:40] man a Holy Ghost to change his life and
[1:24:43] make him a new creature. And you say
[1:24:46] they turned such away.
[1:24:51] This is the hour that we're living in.
[1:24:56] Let me tell you, this church ought to be
[1:24:57] full tonight.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Where are they?
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Where where where are the believers?
[1:25:12] Brother Baller, if we had everybody that
[1:25:14] that had some at some point went through
[1:25:16] this church, we couldn't put them all in
[1:25:18] the balcony.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Where are the believers?
[1:25:26] Maybe somebody hears that.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Here's David now. David acting as the
[1:25:32] messenger of the hour. He's come to
[1:25:34] deliver a message to Solomon. Exactly.
[1:25:37] God's expectations.
[1:25:39] And brothers and sisters, just like
[1:25:41] Solomon needed a messenger to follow the
[1:25:43] pattern to follow, we need a messenger
[1:25:45] that God given that has a God-given
[1:25:47] pattern of how we're able to live our
[1:25:49] lives.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; So that this vessel is a vessel of
[1:25:55] honor.
[1:26:01] Because let me tell you, if God is ever
[1:26:03] going to have a bride without spot or
[1:26:06] wrinkle,
[1:26:09] she's going to have to come a certain
[1:26:10] way.
[1:26:14] She's going to have to act a certain
[1:26:15] way.
[1:26:17] She's going to have to run her household
[1:26:19] a certain way.
[1:26:21] Men, you're going to have to be men of
[1:26:23] your houses.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to be husbands in
[1:26:28] the house. You're going to have to be
[1:26:29] the head of the house.
[1:26:31] You're going to have to treat your wives
[1:26:35] as God would treat the bride.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you saying, "Oh, me about right
[1:26:40] now."
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; But this bride is going to be a special
[1:26:48] person. She's going to she's going to be
[1:26:51] she's she she's going to keep her house
[1:26:52] a certain way. She lives a certain way.
[1:26:56] Let me tell you, brother, something. If
[1:26:57] you hadn't figured this out, you're
[1:26:58] you're younger than I am because I
[1:27:00] figured out a long time ago. I didn't
[1:27:02] learn this lesson a long time ago, but I
[1:27:04] figured it out a long time ago. Women
[1:27:06] like their house a certain way.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I said, I knew this a long time ago. I
[1:27:15] didn't learn it a long time ago.
[1:27:19] I can tell when the tension gets up in
[1:27:21] the house.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Y'all have that happen at your place?
[1:27:28] It's usually because there's shoes in
[1:27:30] the floor, socks in the floor, dishes in
[1:27:32] the sink.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Because why? She wants her place to be a
[1:27:41] certain way.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; If it's dirty, she don't like it. She
[1:27:45] don't like clutter. She don't like the
[1:27:46] house dirty. She don't like clutter.
[1:27:51] You don't believe me? Just scatter some
[1:27:53] stuff around. Leave it laying for a few
[1:27:55] days.
[1:27:58] You fix it to be met with a whirlwind,
[1:28:00] maybe a tornado.
[1:28:08] I'm going to leave you two alone, but I
[1:28:10] could tell a story
[1:28:16] because it's a certain way that she
[1:28:18] likes things.
[1:28:21] The bride doesn't like her house to be
[1:28:23] all filled with smut and filth of this
[1:28:26] world.
[1:28:27] She doesn't like her She doesn't like
[1:28:30] for you to bring the trash in. She's
[1:28:32] trying to get the trash out. That's the
[1:28:34] bride in this hour. I don't want trashy
[1:28:37] living in my life. I'm trying to get all
[1:28:39] of that out of my life. I want to get
[1:28:41] the garbage out.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; We ought to be getting the garbage out
[1:28:45] of our lives in this hour.
[1:28:49] And when she goes to cleaning,
[1:28:52] she scrubs
[1:28:55] and she scrubs
[1:28:57] and she scrubs.
[1:29:00] And if you scrubed, you probably didn't
[1:29:02] scrub long enough, husbands.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we got a we got a shower stall
[1:29:11] that we built.
[1:29:15] I I'm not. Yeah, we got a shower stall
[1:29:18] we built and it's got tile. Okay. We put
[1:29:22] little stone pebbles in the floor of it.
[1:29:24] Brother Ber
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; and it's got 10 million grout lines
[1:29:32] and she goes I hear her in there.
[1:29:35] I hear those bristles just a scrubbing
[1:29:37] and scrubbing and scrubbing and
[1:29:38] scrubbing
[1:29:40] and for it says like an hour she's in
[1:29:43] there scrubbing. I'm like it's good
[1:29:45] enough. It's just me and you here. It's
[1:29:48] good enough but it's not good enough for
[1:29:50] her.
[1:29:52] I want that grout to be white.
[1:29:56] There's a spot over there. What? What?
[1:29:58] What? She said, "What kind of soap do
[1:30:00] you use? It don't come off of your
[1:30:02] side." I don't know. The same soap you
[1:30:05] use.
[1:30:11] And we scrub and she scrubs and she
[1:30:13] scrubs. She's not happy till the final
[1:30:16] stain is gone.
[1:30:21] Sometimes we need the bleach.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; We need the bleach in our lives.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; I got smart here a while back. You know,
[1:30:29] I I try to think outside the box.
[1:30:33] So, she says, "I don't like the smell of
[1:30:35] bleach. I know bleach will clean it, but
[1:30:36] it it burns my eyes and burns my lungs.
[1:30:39] I don't like it." I said, "Oh, well,
[1:30:40] okay. Use this generic stuff and scrub
[1:30:44] all day."
[1:30:47] Well, I was in one of those little
[1:30:49] pickles.
[1:30:53] I could see the look on her face. I'm
[1:30:54] like, I got to do something. I'm going
[1:30:56] to go clean this shower before she even
[1:30:57] asked.
[1:31:01] So, I go in there and I start scrubbing
[1:31:03] and I got I'm doing this. I think, I
[1:31:05] know what they used to use peroxide in
[1:31:07] the hospitals
[1:31:10] to clean with. It don't smell. It don't
[1:31:13] burn your eyes. It don't burn your
[1:31:14] lungs. So, I got me a big bottle of
[1:31:16] peroxide and I
[1:31:23] and I'm coating all the walls and I'm
[1:31:26] scrubbing and I'm scrubbing. I This is
[1:31:27] working pretty good.
[1:31:30] I had the door shut where she couldn't
[1:31:31] see.
[1:31:33] And I take it and then I go down there
[1:31:35] grout lines on the floor. I thought,
[1:31:37] man, this is kind of kind of dirty. Why?
[1:31:40] And I just poured the bottle out. And
[1:31:41] man, that stuff, you know how peroxide
[1:31:43] does, it just foams. I thought, man,
[1:31:45] this stuff going to run out in the
[1:31:46] floor. It wasn't that bad. But it was
[1:31:49] just foaming and bubbling and foaming
[1:31:51] and bubbling and foaming and bubbling.
[1:31:54] But the house had to be cleaned.
[1:31:59] Sometimes we need to find our lives to
[1:32:01] be dipped down into the blood, into the
[1:32:03] bleach of Jesus Christ, into the
[1:32:05] peroxide of Jesus Christ that eliminates
[1:32:08] those stains.
[1:32:15] Take the stain away.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; But the bride is not happy until the
[1:32:22] life is clean.
[1:32:25] Now watch what David says here. Getting
[1:32:27] back to our story. David tells talks now
[1:32:29] and he says to the congregation
[1:32:33] Solomon my son whom a God alone God has
[1:32:35] chosen is yet young and tender and the
[1:32:38] work is great for the palace is not for
[1:32:43] man
[1:32:48] but for the Lord our God.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; The palace is not for man.
[1:32:57] You say, "Man, I I live my life and I
[1:32:59] wished I could do this and if I could do
[1:33:01] that and if I could to go here and if I
[1:33:02] had this job and if I had this career
[1:33:04] and if I could marry this woman and if I
[1:33:06] could have this car, if I could have
[1:33:08] this home,
[1:33:11] it's not for man.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; The life that we live is not for man.
[1:33:15] It's for God to live through us. He's
[1:33:17] looking for a place to dwell. Not a
[1:33:19] place that you could satisfy your every
[1:33:21] need and want and wander,
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; but he's looking for a life lived.
[1:33:31] David tells all the preparations that
[1:33:33] been said here and the preparations have
[1:33:35] been made. And he said, "Moreover,
[1:33:37] because I have set my affection
[1:33:41] to the house of my God.
[1:33:47] I've set my affection
[1:33:49] to the house of my God." What is your
[1:33:52] affection? David's affection was his his
[1:33:55] love, his desire, his his want for the
[1:33:58] things of God to take place and to
[1:34:00] happen in his life. I set my affections
[1:34:03] on the house of God. And that's where we
[1:34:06] got to be in this hour. We have to set
[1:34:08] our affections on the house of God.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; David wasn't just going through life day
[1:34:16] by day, day by day, here, here, there,
[1:34:18] and and everywhere, but he was preparing
[1:34:20] for a work of the Lord. He was following
[1:34:24] a pattern. So let me ask you, what is a
[1:34:26] pattern?
[1:34:29] It's a word we know, we hear, we think
[1:34:30] about it. But have you really thought
[1:34:31] about what the pattern really says? The
[1:34:34] definition of pattern is a form or a
[1:34:37] model proposed for imitation.
[1:34:43] So let me ask you, is your life
[1:34:45] imitating the life of Jesus Christ?
[1:34:48] Is our life imitating the life that was
[1:34:50] lived in Paul's day?
[1:34:53] Is our life imitating the life that was
[1:34:55] before our founding fathers, Ireneius,
[1:34:57] Martin, Columbus, because he said they
[1:34:59] all preached the same thing.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Now, did they progress? Sure, they
[1:35:03] progressed. They had different things.
[1:35:05] They they begin to move forward. But the
[1:35:07] original group, the original church at
[1:35:10] Ephesus, are we right there? Are we
[1:35:12] living that life? Are our affections set
[1:35:15] up on that? Are we living our life as a
[1:35:17] model imitation
[1:35:19] of that? Listen what he says in the
[1:35:21] church age book. We know exactly from
[1:35:24] the word which was recorded by the Holy
[1:35:26] Spirit how the first the original church
[1:35:29] was founded and God manifested himself
[1:35:33] in her. The word can't change or be
[1:35:37] changed because the word is God. And he
[1:35:40] says thus listen now. Thus what the
[1:35:43] church was at Pentecost is the standard.
[1:35:46] That's the pattern. Yeah,
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; that's the pattern. There is no other
[1:35:52] pattern.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; God has not changed the pattern.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; You think that was important since he
[1:36:02] said that three times in about a half a
[1:36:04] paragraph.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; God has not changed the pattern. He has
[1:36:08] to keep on doing until the church age
[1:36:11] closes.
[1:36:13] So don't get led astray. He says, "Don't
[1:36:16] get led astray." When I said that God
[1:36:19] and his ways never change, I did not
[1:36:22] listen to this. This is good. I did not
[1:36:24] say that the church and its messengers
[1:36:26] could not change.
[1:36:28] He said because the church isn't God, so
[1:36:31] she can change. But what I said was that
[1:36:34] was because of an unchanging God with
[1:36:36] unchanging ways. We can go back to the
[1:36:40] beginning and see the first and perfect
[1:36:44] act of God and then judge by that
[1:36:48] standard.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; He says that is how it's done.
[1:36:57] You want to know where you're at, go
[1:36:59] back and look at the book of Acts. You
[1:37:01] want to know where you're at, go back
[1:37:03] and and read what Paul wrote. If you
[1:37:06] want to know where you're at, go back
[1:37:07] and read what he said to the Ephesian
[1:37:08] church and what he said in and to the
[1:37:10] letters uh to to Ephesus and to uh all
[1:37:13] the different places that he traveled.
[1:37:14] Go back and read and see what happened
[1:37:16] in Paul's life.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Listen to this
[1:37:29] now. The first key that we have here is
[1:37:31] we received of the Lord. There comes
[1:37:32] another and less and slightly less
[1:37:35] wonderful truth. I said that the true
[1:37:37] church would always try to act like it
[1:37:40] was in the book of Acts. That's exactly
[1:37:42] right. But we have discovered that the
[1:37:44] word also teaches an invasion of error
[1:37:48] until it is complete blackout of truth.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Do you see how precious the word is?
[1:37:59] because there is going to come a
[1:38:01] complete blackout of truth. He said in
[1:38:03] the last days when the Lord is about to
[1:38:05] appear, there's going to be a complete
[1:38:08] blackout. If you look at this picture,
[1:38:09] they've got it completely blacked out,
[1:38:11] but there is a sliver of light.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; There is a sliver of light in Elton,
[1:38:17] Kentucky. There is a sliver of light
[1:38:19] that's being portrayed by a bride of
[1:38:21] Christ in this area, in Johnson City, in
[1:38:24] mind, Louisiana, in Virginia, in Europe.
[1:38:29] There's a little sliver of light that is
[1:38:31] just shining and reflecting back what
[1:38:33] God is putting upon them.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; He says so he said a question now arises
[1:38:39] in our minds. Can you imagine as people
[1:38:40] said that it's going to be complete
[1:38:42] darkness. There would be no truth. So
[1:38:44] where does that leave us? He said a
[1:38:46] question comes into our mind now and it
[1:38:48] arises. Does God forsake his own and let
[1:38:51] them fall into a state of complete
[1:38:53] deception?
[1:38:56] He said, "Oh, on no account." But the
[1:38:59] scripture says clearly in Matthew 24:24,
[1:39:02] "The elect cannot be deceived."
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; She cannot be deceived because she's
[1:39:09] following what God has placed on her
[1:39:11] plate. She cannot be deceived because
[1:39:13] she's listening to a voice in the hour
[1:39:15] that we're living in. and a voice that
[1:39:18] does not deceive him, a voice that does
[1:39:20] not lie, a voice that follows what the
[1:39:23] Holy Ghost has said unto him.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; That's the voice.
[1:39:29] There shall arise false Christ, false
[1:39:31] prophets. They shall show great signs
[1:39:34] and wonders in so much as if it were
[1:39:35] possible. If it were possible,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; it's not possible, Sister Becky.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; There's something rooted on the inside,
[1:39:44] down deep on the inside. It's not
[1:39:46] possible for me to be deceived.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Nobody talked me into this.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; And nobody's going to talk me out of it,
[1:39:56] brother B. Nobody talked me into this.
[1:39:59] But when I begin to read the word in the
[1:40:02] book, and I didn't understand it, but
[1:40:05] then I heard the voice of the hour
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; and it be to clarify the words that I
[1:40:11] was reading.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; That's what talked me into this.
[1:40:24] Listen to this.
[1:40:26] The answer is clear before us. There is
[1:40:28] a true church and a false church. We
[1:40:30] talked about that Sunday a little bit.
[1:40:31] The true vine and a false vine. But of
[1:40:34] course, that false church, that false
[1:40:36] vine body will always try to usurp
[1:40:41] usurp the position of the true church.
[1:40:44] What does that usurp mean? It means to
[1:40:46] take a position of power or importance
[1:40:53] always.
[1:40:55] Satan is going to try to usurp what God
[1:40:58] has given you. He said always. And he
[1:41:01] said, but and take the position of that
[1:41:03] true church and contend, which means
[1:41:06] fight. Satan's going to fight that she
[1:41:10] is not the elect.
[1:41:16] He's going to tell you. He's going to
[1:41:19] talk to you. He's going to show you
[1:41:21] things
[1:41:27] to tell you you're not the elect.
[1:41:35] He tries to do that. I seen a clip today
[1:41:38] and it said it said uh
[1:41:46] if you're not in branomism that was I
[1:41:49] was trying to think how she word it keep
[1:41:51] scrolling
[1:41:53] thought what in the world so I began to
[1:41:56] listen and I thought you wolf
[1:42:01] you wolf in sheep's clothing she began
[1:42:03] to quote the message portions
[1:42:06] and then deny it and quote portions and
[1:42:10] deny it. And I wanted to for the first
[1:42:12] time in my life to reply to one of them
[1:42:14] things
[1:42:16] and say, "Why don't you say all that he
[1:42:19] said?"
[1:42:21] She began to ask certain kind of
[1:42:22] questions and then say, "Well, it this
[1:42:24] is this is his own idea. This is" I
[1:42:26] said, "No, no, I knew where she was
[1:42:28] getting them from."
[1:42:33] Do you see why it's so important that we
[1:42:34] stay in the book?
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; We stay in the word because Satan is
[1:42:38] constantly in a combatant. He's trying
[1:42:40] to kill the true church, the true living
[1:42:43] word and the church of God. That is the
[1:42:45] pattern. So according to this pattern,
[1:42:48] we're going to be in this spiritual
[1:42:49] battle until the Lord comes back and we
[1:42:51] take a rapture.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; This battle is going to continue.
[1:43:01] Satan don't want you in church tonight.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; How many had a battle to get here?
[1:43:07] Look at that. Well,
[1:43:10] Satan don't want you reading your Bible.
[1:43:13] How many struggle with that?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; He don't want you listening to tapes.
[1:43:19] How many struggle with that?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Why do you struggle with it?
[1:43:24] Because he occupies your time.
[1:43:29] If you got some busy uh uh some rest
[1:43:32] time and you think, man, I'm just going
[1:43:33] to go and I'm going to sit and I'm going
[1:43:34] to read the word. I'm going to listen to
[1:43:36] a tape. Watch and see what happens.
[1:43:39] Something will come up.
[1:43:42] There'll be some kind of emergency. Some
[1:43:43] kind of something will come up. Somebody
[1:43:45] will have a flat tire. Something over
[1:43:46] here will happen. Honey, can you do
[1:43:48] this? Honey, can you do that?
[1:43:57] But it's a a pattern. He doesn't want
[1:44:00] you to have that. He don't want you to
[1:44:01] have time to listen to the message.
[1:44:05] Why is that?
[1:44:08] Well, Josh, the more dedicated you find
[1:44:10] yourselves to Christ,
[1:44:13] the closer you get to Christ, the closer
[1:44:15] you come to looking like the pattern of
[1:44:17] the bride,
[1:44:19] the more you get into the word, the
[1:44:21] greater your faith becomes.
[1:44:24] Then those mountains that seem like they
[1:44:27] could not be moved,
[1:44:31] they become movable.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Those those valleys that you find
[1:44:36] yourself going through, the greater your
[1:44:38] faith becomes in the word and you take
[1:44:40] on that pattern of Christ,
[1:44:45] you begin to become find yourself as an
[1:44:47] overcomer.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; It's in the word. Yeah.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing by hearing.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; So when Satan says you can't be healed,
[1:44:58] what does the word say in Isaiah 53?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Do you see where your faith is? That's
[1:45:03] how your faith is built. That's how your
[1:45:05] faith grows.
[1:45:07] Because everything that Satan throws at
[1:45:09] you, Jesus has already answered.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus has already done it.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Satan is nothing but a byproduct.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; He's not a creator.
[1:45:22] He's a perverter.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Have you ever noticed, and I'm trying to
[1:45:30] find a place to to get off here. Have
[1:45:33] you ever noticed, brothers and sisters,
[1:45:34] that that people that know the message,
[1:45:37] they know the message of the hour, and
[1:45:38] they know it's truth, but they fail to
[1:45:40] follow it. Have you ever noticed they're
[1:45:41] some of the most miserable people you'll
[1:45:43] ever come in contact with?
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Why is that?
[1:45:49] is because there is a constant battle
[1:45:51] going on in their mind that they can't
[1:45:53] settle.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And they're fighting this battle in
[1:45:57] their mind. They know what's right. They
[1:45:59] know the truth. They know the word, but
[1:46:03] yet they cannot settle it down in their
[1:46:05] heart. And they can't separate
[1:46:07] themselves to a life that is fully
[1:46:09] surrendered to God.
[1:46:13] So this battle to follow the pattern
[1:46:17] is a constant. And they go through life
[1:46:20] and it's it's just over and over and
[1:46:21] over. They know they shouldn't dress a
[1:46:23] certain way, but they're pulled to dress
[1:46:27] immodestly.
[1:46:29] They know that they shouldn't be
[1:46:30] smoking, drinking, vaping, drugging. You
[1:46:32] put whatever you want in there. But
[1:46:34] there is something that is pulling them
[1:46:36] that direction.
[1:46:38] They can't resist it because they've not
[1:46:41] settled it. They've not separated
[1:46:42] themselves from the things of the world.
[1:46:45] There are women who know that it's not
[1:46:47] right to be cutting their hair, but
[1:46:49] they're pulled by the design, the
[1:46:52] designers of the world
[1:46:54] because they're not settled.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; They've not settled it down into their
[1:46:58] heart. They're not settled and
[1:46:59] completely separated from the world.
[1:47:02] They haven't completely fallen in love
[1:47:04] with Christ.
[1:47:07] And you you know a lot of times you know
[1:47:10] the prophet was was was
[1:47:14] tagged and and kind of ridiculed as a
[1:47:16] woman hater.
[1:47:19] He was not a woman hater. He loved the
[1:47:22] women. He loved the the the the ladies,
[1:47:25] the sisters of the church. What he was
[1:47:27] trying to do was send a warning out
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; to those who wasn't following the word
[1:47:32] of God and following the pattern. And he
[1:47:34] was trying to let them know this is not
[1:47:36] what God has in mind for you.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; And if they could have just gotten in
[1:47:43] love with God and in love with the
[1:47:46] bridegroom,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; they wouldn't allow the things in their
[1:47:49] life to saturate them.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; But when you fall in love with God and
[1:47:58] that love affair begins to grow, I don't
[1:48:00] want to hurt him. That's right.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; It's just like in a husband and a wife.
[1:48:05] If that love is really there, you don't
[1:48:07] want to hurt him.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; I don't want to do things that would
[1:48:11] make my wife upset.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; She don't try to do things to uh
[1:48:18] intentionally provoke me, Brother Steve.
[1:48:23] But she loves me
[1:48:26] and I love her. She You know what my
[1:48:28] wife does? She puts me first.
[1:48:33] And you know what I try to do? Put her
[1:48:36] first.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; If I hurt her, I'm hurting me. And if
[1:48:44] I'm hurting me, I'm hurting Christ.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you how simple it is. I said the
[1:48:51] other night, I said, "You know what I
[1:48:52] want? I want some ice cream."
[1:48:58] Why ain't there a ice cream diet?
[1:49:03] You got a meat diet. You got a a a fruit
[1:49:07] diet, a vegetable diet. Where's the ice
[1:49:09] cream diet?
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; I'd keep Dairy Queen in business if we
[1:49:17] had ice cream diet.
[1:49:21] But so I said, I'm we let's run to the
[1:49:23] dollar store
[1:49:25] and and and and get some ice cream.
[1:49:28] She said, ' Okay, what kind you want?'
[1:49:32] I said, 'Well, you know, some of that
[1:49:34] Neapolitan.
[1:49:36] Ain't that what it's called? Neapolitan.
[1:49:39] And we'll put some of your I'll put some
[1:49:41] of your strawberry jelly on top of it.
[1:49:42] And boy, it'll be good,
[1:49:46] Brother Stay. What are you laughing at?
[1:49:52] And I said, but I tell you what, you you
[1:49:54] get whatever you want cuz I know you
[1:49:55] don't like Neapolitan.
[1:49:57] I said, 'I know you don't like you like
[1:49:59] that chocolate with them brownies in it.
[1:50:01] I said, ' Just get that. I like it, too.
[1:50:03] I like it all. It'll be fine. I can put
[1:50:06] some jelly on that, too.
[1:50:10] So, she runs into the store. I can eat
[1:50:13] that jelly out of the jar, Brother
[1:50:14] Steve. You can laugh all you want, but
[1:50:15] that stuff's good.
[1:50:18] She runs into the store,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; and you know what she brought back?
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Neapolitan.
[1:50:28] Why? Because she knew that's what I
[1:50:31] wanted. And if I would have went into
[1:50:33] the store, what would I have brought
[1:50:35] back?
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Chocolate with brownies.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Do you see how that works? Husbands and
[1:50:41] wives.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; It's putting them before yourself.
[1:50:47] Now, is that always the way it always
[1:50:49] works? No. Sometimes we can all be a
[1:50:51] little selfish,
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; but we're trying.
[1:50:55] We're trying. We're trying to do what's
[1:50:58] right.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm in love with her.
[1:51:01] That's my bride. That's my wife. That's
[1:51:03] the one that I would give my life for.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; You would give your life for your wife,
[1:51:11] brother Ber. If somebody come at her, we
[1:51:13] would lay ourselves in front to protect
[1:51:16] them.
[1:51:24] We got to find a place to stop. These
[1:51:26] these just get these sermons just get
[1:51:28] longer and longer. Forgive us
[1:51:36] to the elect. God is calling the elect.
[1:51:40] They know it. Calling the virtuous
[1:51:42] bride, the word, the last day church,
[1:51:44] the elected lady of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:46] Christ. Jesus is the word. How many
[1:51:49] believes that
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; congregation says amen. All right. Then
[1:51:53] then the bride is always part of the
[1:51:56] bridegroom.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Listen to that. The bride is always part
[1:52:03] of the bridegroom. So the bride will not
[1:52:06] be a denomination.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; It'll have to be the word manifested to
[1:52:12] be the bride of Christ. He promised to
[1:52:14] do it. He said how he did it. He never
[1:52:17] loses his pattern.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; He always did it by a pattern. He done
[1:52:27] it every time by the pattern. He does it
[1:52:30] again. Calling out his virtuous bride in
[1:52:32] the last day. The lovely Rebecca waiting
[1:52:36] for her Isaac. Let's stand to our feet
[1:52:40] tonight.
[1:52:42] We've got more. We can We can just put
[1:52:44] it off. We can just wait.
[1:52:47] the lovely Rebecca waiting for her
[1:52:51] Isaac.
[1:52:54] Next time we'll get into the Ephesian
[1:52:56] church and Paul and how he was called in
[1:52:58] the ministry. But I want to try to get
[1:53:00] tonight to let you know that there is a
[1:53:02] pattern that has been followed from
[1:53:04] Moses. There was a tabernacle that Moses
[1:53:06] had to build. There was a pattern to
[1:53:08] follow. There was a tabernacle that that
[1:53:10] David was was called to set Solomon to
[1:53:12] build. There was a pattern to follow.
[1:53:14] There was a pattern in this last day to
[1:53:17] be followed to the stature of a perfect
[1:53:19] man that builds and builds and builds
[1:53:21] and builds. It's a pattern that we
[1:53:23] follow.
[1:53:25] The pattern says that he will restore
[1:53:27] the faith of the children back to that
[1:53:29] of the fathers.
[1:53:31] The original Bible faith is to be
[1:53:33] restored by the seventh angel.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; God had those stars in his hands.
[1:53:43] Restore.
[1:53:49] Restore my people.
[1:53:52] Restore my people back to what they know
[1:53:56] is true. Restore my people. Don't let
[1:54:00] them be shaken. Don't let them be moved.
[1:54:04] Restore them back to the word. He said,
[1:54:07] "Oh, how I love this. All the mysteries
[1:54:08] of the seals, the reformers, they never
[1:54:11] understood it fully. All the reformers,
[1:54:14] Wesley, Luther, Columbus, Martin,
[1:54:16] Ireneius, they never fully understood
[1:54:18] it. He said, "But now look at Malachi
[1:54:21] 4."
[1:54:23] He says, "You can just mark that one
[1:54:25] down. He's a prophet.
[1:54:30] He's a prophet. He's a prophet and he
[1:54:33] restores the original faith of the
[1:54:36] fathers. you love the Lord tonight.
[1:54:39] Amen. Let's just bow our heads if we
[1:54:42] could. Heavenly Father, we just come
[1:54:44] before you tonight with grateful hearts,
[1:54:45] Lord. Thankful, Lord, for what you've
[1:54:47] done in this hour. We're thankful, Lord,
[1:54:51] that you've just moved on the scene in
[1:54:53] our lives in the church here. That our
[1:54:56] faith is being restored back to that of
[1:54:58] the fathers, the original church. That
[1:55:00] we can stand upon the word of God
[1:55:02] tonight, knowing that it's a
[1:55:03] neverchanging,
[1:55:06] neverchanging word. That if someone was
[1:55:09] healed yesterday, I can be healed today.
[1:55:11] If salvation was good yesterday,
[1:55:13] salvation's good today. And he says it
[1:55:15] will stay that way and remain that way
[1:55:17] to the end of the ages.
[1:55:21] because we're following a pattern. We
[1:55:24] want our life to be so right, so in
[1:55:26] tune, so just what you want it to be so
[1:55:28] that you can dwell in this house.
[1:55:34] This vessel of clay should be so much
[1:55:36] more than a house, but we want it to be
[1:55:39] a home. A home where you can dwell,
[1:55:42] where you can live, where you can rest.
[1:55:44] Father, David said he wanted a place
[1:55:47] that he could rest the ark of the
[1:55:49] covenant.
[1:55:50] And Lord, we ask that you would rest
[1:55:53] your Holy Spirit in us tonight. Lord, we
[1:55:56] thank you for all you do for us and for
[1:55:58] all you've ministered to us in the last
[1:56:00] days and and in the last few services.
[1:56:03] We thank you for good reports that we've
[1:56:05] heard today. We positive testimonies of
[1:56:08] you moving in the scene, you moving on
[1:56:10] the lives of your people in this church
[1:56:11] and in this building. We ask a special
[1:56:14] prayer tonight on brother Glenn. We ask
[1:56:16] Lord that you would just move and give
[1:56:18] him strength. Grant grant him the
[1:56:19] energy. Help him to put back on his
[1:56:21] weight and and and be able to get his
[1:56:24] strength back.
[1:56:26] You're not finished with him yet. Lord,
[1:56:29] continue to bless him. Use him. Lord,
[1:56:32] the different ones that have a need in
[1:56:34] their life, in their body, we're still
[1:56:36] believing. We're still believing that
[1:56:37] you touch damaged lungs. We're still
[1:56:40] believing that you still heal cancer.
[1:56:43] We're still believing that you're a
[1:56:44] comforter to those who are in grief
[1:56:46] tonight
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:56:50] because on this word we stand, Lord,
[1:56:55] when we've done all we know to do, stand
[1:56:58] upon the word. Stand up on your
[1:57:00] promises. Stand upon the very things
[1:57:03] that you said we could have in this hour
[1:57:04] through the power and the demonstration
[1:57:06] of the church of Pentecost.
[1:57:09] We love you, Lord. We just ask you
[1:57:11] continue to bless the church here. Bless
[1:57:13] each household
[1:57:15] that you would move in the scene in a
[1:57:17] special way.
[1:57:19] Make us men,
[1:57:22] real men of God.
[1:57:26] Give us strength. Give us the courage.
[1:57:28] Give us the boldness
[1:57:30] to be the head of the house
[1:57:34] and to love our wives the way you love
[1:57:37] the bride. Help
[1:57:40] us to speak to our our wives and our
[1:57:42] children the way you speak to your wife
[1:57:44] and your children. How you speak words
[1:57:46] of love and compassion
[1:57:51] and words of gift and giving.
[1:57:54] How you adore us. Oh Lord, we ought to
[1:57:56] be able to raise our hands and raise our
[1:57:58] voices and just tell you how much we
[1:58:00] adore you. But constantly
[1:58:04] from the very works of Calvary, you've
[1:58:07] poured out your love on us. And we thank
[1:58:10] you for it, Lord. We praise you. We lift
[1:58:13] your name on high. We worship you
[1:58:15] tonight with all within us, Lord. We
[1:58:18] thank you. We love you. In Jesus' name
[1:58:20] we pray.
