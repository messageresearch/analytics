[33:01] word

[33:20] tired it's been a uh we're not used to
[33:23] these kind of services and just to be
[33:25] honest we we probably work more during

[33:37] holiday weekend I hope everybody gets a
[33:38] little time off tomorrow and and uh be
[33:41] able to
[33:42] enjoy your day
[33:44] um I want to speak again we're going to
[33:46] try to finish up my thought that I've
[33:47] been studying on Joshua I thought it was
[33:49] good that all the other ministers have
[33:51] been hitting on this brother Byler and
[33:53] and brother Andrew and brother Zach and
[33:55] it just seems like it's just been a it's
[33:57] just been it's been good for me I'll say
[33:59] it that way and Trust you've enjoyed it
[34:00] too
[34:02] um start with this quote here and don't
[34:03] want to keep you standing long but we
[34:05] will be reading out of Joshua chapter 6.
[34:08] says if there's no battle then there's
[34:12] no victory
[34:14] he said but you gotta have a battle to
[34:16] have a victory if it was just given to
[34:18] you it wouldn't be no Victory he said
[34:22] but he that overcometh is the one who
[34:25] has the victory so Jesus came to the
[34:28] Earth he had a battle he won the Victory
[34:30] and tonight we have a battle and with
[34:33] Christ we have the victory now the Lord
[34:37] bless you he said
[34:38] amen Joshua chapter 6.
[34:42] there's nothing like a victory after a
[34:44] battle is it amen
[34:46] we're going to talk about Jericho here
[34:48] so chapter six now Jericho was
[34:51] straightly shut up because of the
[34:53] children of Israel none went out and
[34:56] none came in and the Lord said unto
[34:58] Joshua see I have given into thine hands
[35:01] Jericho and the King thereof and the
[35:03] Mighty Men of Valor and you shall come
[35:05] past the city all you Men of War and go
[35:08] round about the city once thus shall do
[35:11] six days
[35:13] and the Seven priests shall bear the
[35:15] before the ark seven trumpets of ram
[35:17] Ram's horns and the seventh day ye shall
[35:20] Compass the city seven times and the
[35:23] priest shall blow with the trumpets and
[35:25] it shall come to pass that when they
[35:27] make a long blast with the Ram's Horn
[35:29] and when you hear the sound of the
[35:31] trumpet all the people shall Shout with
[35:33] a great shout and the wall of the Cities
[35:36] shall fall down flat and the people
[35:39] shall Ascend up every man straight
[35:41] before him now that sounds unreasonable
[35:43] doesn't it in our minds it's it's just
[35:45] it's it's it's unreasonable it's
[35:47] unfathomable it's impossible
[35:50] and Joshua the son of nine called the
[35:52] priests and set up said unto them take
[35:54] up the Ark of the Covenant again Joshua
[35:57] he knew from from previous time we got
[35:59] to keep going God first
[36:01] so immediately take up the Ark of the
[36:03] Covenant and let seven priests bear the
[36:06] seven trumpets of Ram's horns before the
[36:08] Ark of the Lord and he said unto the
[36:10] people pass on and come past the city
[36:12] and let them let his arms pass on before
[36:14] the Ark of the Lord
[36:16] and it came to pass when Joshua had
[36:18] spoken unto the people that seven
[36:20] priests bearing seven trumpets of Ram's
[36:22] horns passed on before the Lord and blew
[36:25] with the trumpets and the Ark of the
[36:27] Covenant of the Lord followed them and
[36:30] the armed men went before the priests
[36:32] that blew with the trumpets and rear
[36:34] rearward came after the ark the priests
[36:37] going on and blowing the trumpets and
[36:40] Joshua had commanded the people saying
[36:42] ye shall not shout or make any noise
[36:44] with your voice neither shall any word
[36:46] proceed out of your mouth until the day
[36:48] I bid you to shout then shall ye shall I
[36:53] thought it was a amazing statement when
[36:55] brother Zach was preaching and he was
[36:57] talking about that and he brought it out
[36:58] that how can you imagine walking around
[37:00] the city day after day and you can't
[37:02] utter a word
[37:05] and that that that's an amazing feat we
[37:07] we're human beings we like to talk we
[37:09] like to laugh we like to cut up no they
[37:12] did not utter a word not a sound come
[37:15] out of them
[37:17] and so the Ark of the Lord can pass the
[37:19] city going about it once and they came
[37:21] into the camp and lodged in the camp and
[37:23] Joshua Rose early in the morning the
[37:25] priest took up the Ark of the Lord and
[37:27] seven priests bearing seven trumpets of
[37:29] Ram's horns before the Ark of the Lord
[37:31] went on continually and blew with the
[37:34] trumpets and armed men went before them
[37:36] and rearward came after the Ark of the
[37:38] Lord the priest going on and blowing the
[37:41] trumpets
[37:42] and the second day they can pass the
[37:44] city once and returned into the camp so
[37:47] they did six days day after day after
[37:49] day
[37:50] and he came to pass on the seventh day
[37:52] that they Rose early and about the
[37:54] dawning of day and Compass the city
[37:56] after the same manner seven times only
[38:00] on that day they compasted can pass the
[38:02] city seven times and it came to pass on
[38:05] the seventh time when the priest blew
[38:07] the trumpets Joshua said unto the people
[38:09] shout for the Lord hath given you the
[38:13] city
[38:14] now at this time they're still sitting
[38:16] on the outside they're still looking at
[38:17] big huge walls but he says shout because
[38:20] the Lord has given you the city
[38:23] and the city shall be accursed even it
[38:26] and all is therein the Lord only Rahab
[38:28] the Harlot shall live she and all that's
[38:31] all with her house in in the house
[38:33] because she hid The Messengers that we
[38:36] sent
[38:37] and ye in any wise keep yourselves from
[38:39] the accursed thing this is important
[38:41] here keep yourself from the accursed
[38:43] thing let yours let lest you make
[38:46] yourselves a curse then you take of the
[38:49] accursed thing and make and make a camp
[38:51] of Israel curse and trouble it and we
[38:54] know what happened in the future Aiken
[38:56] began to take a wedge that he didn't
[38:58] need to take and ended up cursing the
[39:00] whole tribe the whole Camp there until
[39:02] they had to find out kill him Stone him
[39:04] and brother Byler brought that out last
[39:06] week
[39:07] but all the silver and the gold and the
[39:09] vessels of brass and iron are
[39:11] consecrated unto the Lord they shall
[39:13] come into the treasury of the Lord so
[39:16] the people shouted when the priest blew
[39:17] the Trump but then it came to pass when
[39:19] the people heard the sound of the
[39:21] trumpet and the people shouted with a
[39:23] great shout that the wall fell down flat
[39:28] so that the people went up into the city
[39:30] every man straight before him and they
[39:34] took the city you may have your seeds
[39:36] may the Lord had the blessings of the
[39:37] reading of the word
[39:39] Kingdom Builders tonight we're going to
[39:42] talk about tearing down the walls and
[39:44] just to give you a little bit of brief
[39:46] history and some some signs like I told
[39:48] you this morning I love it when science
[39:50] can prove the scriptural's Cur the
[39:51] scripture is correct
[39:53] I began to look at this and thinking
[39:54] about Jericho and I just digging into
[39:57] the Jericho and what they found there
[39:59] and back in 1907 to lay a little bit of
[40:02] foundation for you the archaeologists go
[40:04] in and they're trying to
[40:05] excavate and and go through the ruins of
[40:08] Jericho and to go in there and between
[40:11] 1907 and 1940 I think it was and they're
[40:13] trying to look at this site
[40:15] because people have tried to dis dispel
[40:18] they've tried to say that this was all
[40:20] just a story that this really didn't
[40:22] happen that this is impossible and to
[40:24] just the reader of of the of the war or
[40:27] the book it may appear that way it may
[40:30] appear possible it sounds unreasonable
[40:32] How could a city fall upon the shouting
[40:35] of just a an army of people
[40:38] but as the archaeologists began to dig
[40:40] and they began to find
[40:42] they've found Jericho and as they begin
[40:44] to dig they say they found that the the
[40:46] walls definitely tumbled at all at one
[40:50] time
[40:51] they could tell that the way the rubble
[40:53] failed that it was an instant falling of
[40:55] the walls
[40:56] so they began to dig a little closer and
[40:58] say maybe something here really really
[41:00] did happen
[41:01] and as they begin to go through there
[41:03] they found pots of grain
[41:06] we know that this happened right after
[41:08] the Harvest Right the rivers were
[41:10] swollen because of the Harvest they
[41:12] found pot after pot after pot of stored
[41:15] grain now back in those days if you was
[41:17] going to go through a town and destroy
[41:19] it and you was going to take over the
[41:21] city what is one of the things you think
[41:22] would be a hot come on
[41:25] grain but what did the word of God tell
[41:27] children of Israel not to do don't touch
[41:30] anything
[41:31] you leave everything except for the gold
[41:33] the silver the brass the iron and you
[41:35] put that in God's Treasury
[41:37] somebody said nobody in history would
[41:40] ever go through and destroy a city and
[41:42] not take the grain so there's fact
[41:45] number one or two however you want to
[41:46] put that they also
[41:55] also said he told them to burn the city
[41:58] destroy it burn everything within there
[42:00] let the city be burnt three feet deep of
[42:03] Ashes the city completely annihilated
[42:07] and this one here is one that I think is
[42:09] uh one of the most important things
[42:12] two things they didn't find any gold any
[42:14] silver any brass any iron
[42:16] all that was gone
[42:19] but the one thing that they did find
[42:20] they found one little house on the north
[42:22] side of a wall
[42:25] and they couldn't figure out where is
[42:27] this why is this one house standing
[42:29] around this Nine Acre City when every
[42:32] bit of the walls have tumbled down
[42:34] so they had to go back into scripture
[42:36] and try to figure this out and they
[42:38] began to look and they found right here
[42:40] in Chapter 2 of Joshua verse 15 then she
[42:44] let them down by a cord through the
[42:46] window for her house was upon the town
[42:49] wall and she dwelt upon that wall
[42:54] Rahab the Harlot
[42:57] had a little house up on the North side
[43:00] of Jericho and she hid the spies under
[43:03] the Under The Canopy of her house until
[43:05] they came and they began to spot out
[43:07] what did she do but she let them down so
[43:09] there was one house in this whole city
[43:11] that was not under Rubble that was not
[43:14] under ashes then it stood there all by
[43:16] itself God keeps his promises
[43:20] brother Branham said he's there's the
[43:23] land he said and yet some of the
[43:24] Israelites when they looked at it they
[43:27] said well we can't take it we look like
[43:29] grasshoppers upside them big people and
[43:31] the spies came back Joshua and Caleb
[43:34] they knew the God had said and they said
[43:36] we can take it it's ours he said well
[43:40] Jericho was so big so they could run two
[43:42] chariots around it the horse race and
[43:45] how could we go up there with our little
[43:47] Spears and so forth ain't that the way
[43:49] we think about ourselves sometimes how
[43:51] can we go up there as insignific as I am
[43:54] how can I face Satan and all of his
[43:56] Wiles and all of his demons and all of
[43:58] his negativity how can I face that being
[44:01] the little person I am
[44:02] how can we do it he said how can we do
[44:05] with our little spheres the gates are
[44:07] shut up great men in there giants
[44:09] Canaanites probably the descendants of
[44:11] ham how could we ever go in and take
[44:14] that he said they looked at the natural
[44:16] part
[44:18] and he says and this is this is Brother
[44:20] Brown I'm speaking now he says but let
[44:22] me ask you how could this woman walk
[44:24] he's fixing to have a prayer line how
[44:26] could this woman walk how could that one
[44:29] walk how could this man who's fixing to
[44:32] die in the next few days with heart
[44:34] trouble how can he be made well right
[44:37] now it's unreasonable
[44:39] you can't reason it out
[44:42] he said you can't reason it out God
[44:44] isn't known by reason and no man
[44:47] understands it but you've got to accept
[44:50] it by faith we've got to accept what God
[44:52] is going to do in our lives by faith he
[44:55] said it's so it's against science and
[44:57] it's against knowledge the knowledge of
[44:59] this world is foolishness before God
[45:02] it's against all scientific research for
[45:04] a virgin to bring forth a child he said
[45:07] but she did it
[45:11] scientific you know scientists always
[45:13] catching up
[45:15] and and I don't know that this to be
[45:17] factual I caution on even bringing it
[45:20] out but they actually think they had
[45:22] found a portion of a drop of blood that
[45:25] could have belonged to Jesus Christ
[45:27] and they began to examine it through the
[45:30] through the DNA research and they run it
[45:32] through DNA Time After Time After Time
[45:34] and they found that the DNA and that
[45:38] blood sample for one was alive
[45:42] after all these years it was living
[45:45] it was a living organism
[45:47] number two it only had DNA that involved
[45:51] a lady a female
[45:53] it had the mother's side of the DNA
[45:55] Jesus was neither Jew or Gentile
[45:59] there was no no male to put DNA in but
[46:01] there was an extra Y chromosome that
[46:04] made it male
[46:05] it's the only known DNA in in the in
[46:08] history now I can't tell you that's true
[46:11] I can't tell you it's factual but it
[46:12] makes a lot of sense
[46:14] because Jesus was neither Jew nor
[46:16] Gentile and so here we're looking at
[46:18] this and and brother Brown was beginning
[46:20] to talking about this and he says nobody
[46:22] understands it he says but he'll give
[46:24] you this promise it's yours he said
[46:27] every one of you was healed 1900 years
[46:31] ago at Calvary
[46:33] every one of us sitting here in this
[46:34] building it's a finished work we've
[46:36] known that we've heard that because now
[46:38] it's time for us to believe that and
[46:41] step into what God has in place for us
[46:43] 1900 years ago at Calvary I know there's
[46:47] a whole lot of Briars growed up in here
[46:49] A whole lot of Canaanites he says it
[46:51] says the days of Miracles has passed and
[46:53] he said I don't believe in them Holy
[46:55] Rollers he says but go in and take it
[46:58] it's yours get God give it to you it's a
[47:01] promise
[47:02] take it anyhow he said if God said so
[47:05] what do you care about what the
[47:07] Canaanites think
[47:10] if you believe that God can do something
[47:12] in your life if you believe God can give
[47:14] you your healing what do you care about
[47:15] what the doctors think if you believe
[47:18] that God can come in and deliver you
[47:19] from from a a a a habit or a spirit or
[47:23] something that's in your life what do
[47:25] you care what your neighbor thinks
[47:27] I don't care what anybody thinks as long
[47:29] as God is pleased with me
[47:31] and the what how a worship and approach
[47:34] God it doesn't matter about my my
[47:37] neighbor it doesn't matter about my
[47:38] brother it doesn't matter about my
[47:40] sister
[47:41] it's me and God that individual
[47:43] relationship he says those long-faced
[47:46] people say the Miracles the days of
[47:47] Miracles has passed it isn't for them
[47:51] it's for the believer
[47:54] so when people tell you I don't believe
[47:55] in miracles they're right it's not for
[47:58] them they will never receive a miracle
[48:00] but Believers are are under the
[48:03] obligation of God that if you if you
[48:05] desire if you believe it and God
[48:07] promised you something in your life he's
[48:09] going to stand like he's going to
[48:10] perform
[48:11] form exactly what he said brother Brown
[48:14] said a guy ask him said brother Brandon
[48:16] I don't believe it he said it wasn't for
[48:18] you can you imagine saying that to the
[48:20] prophet I don't believe this well it's
[48:23] not for you he said it's only
[48:26] for believers not unbelievers he just
[48:29] set himself up didn't he
[48:31] it's not for you it's for it's not it's
[48:33] not for you it's for believers it's it's
[48:35] unbelie you're an unbeliever he said so
[48:37] go ahead take it I'll send my fear
[48:40] before you I like that
[48:42] when Joshua Was preparing to go in
[48:44] brother Brown said God said go ahead and
[48:46] take it I'll send it my fear before you
[48:50] my angel will prepare a way
[48:53] a lot of times we think we don't have a
[48:55] way we don't have a an in or an out or
[48:58] how we're going to accomplish this but
[48:59] if God is willing to send his Angel
[49:01] before you
[49:03] and God is willing to send an angel of
[49:05] fear upon all your enemies what have you
[49:08] got to fear
[49:11] so here's Joshua and and Joshua and the
[49:14] children of Israel now have crossed over
[49:16] into the Jordan
[49:17] they've set up a the crossover the
[49:20] Jordan River they set up a memorial to
[49:22] remind everybody of what God has done
[49:23] for them
[49:25] and God comes down once again and
[49:27] appears to Joshua
[49:29] God's coming down to give him a fresh
[49:31] account of what's about to happen
[49:34] you know we need that in our lives you
[49:36] may you may overcome a challenge
[49:38] yesterday
[49:39] there's one waiting around the corner
[49:41] and we need God to be constantly fresh
[49:43] in our lives so that we can know that
[49:46] he's there for us and God appeared to
[49:48] Joshua to give him encouragement to give
[49:50] him strength to help him to carry on in
[49:53] the task that's about to happen and God
[49:56] appeared and he comes down here and he
[49:58] says listen Joshua I've got a strategy
[50:00] for you and I want you to follow this
[50:02] strategy and if you'll follow this
[50:05] strategy the people of Israel will have
[50:07] victory
[50:11] you know God always tells his people
[50:14] what to expect
[50:16] he don't leave his people in the dark
[50:20] that's why we had a message in the hour
[50:21] that we're living in it's so that there
[50:24] would be no confusion so that there
[50:26] would be no darkness that we would have
[50:28] to wonder what in the world is this
[50:30] going to be like what is going to happen
[50:32] when the Rapture takes place what is
[50:34] going to happen if this happens over
[50:36] here and this happens over here what are
[50:38] we to expect what's Heaven going to be
[50:40] like we've been given a clear picture
[50:43] God God don't leave anybody out he wants
[50:46] you to know what's about to happen and
[50:48] Joshua needed this encouragement because
[50:50] of this challenge that laid ahead of him
[50:55] here Joshua was in a tight spot you
[50:57] might say
[50:58] he's unfound himself done got over the
[51:00] river and boy you think he would take a
[51:02] deep breath and think
[51:04] goodness this is over but now the real
[51:07] challenge lays ahead
[51:08] a fortified City a difficult task here's
[51:12] Jericho and Joshua knows that this is
[51:14] the oldest inhabited city in the world
[51:16] it's city the city that stood with two
[51:19] massive walls constructed of stone and
[51:21] brick and and the outer wall stood there
[51:25] as a sign to tell everybody that I will
[51:27] not be conquered if a city could speak
[51:29] that's what he would say I will not be
[51:32] conquered
[51:33] and he stands there and he begins to
[51:35] look at this and he looks at he says you
[51:37] know this this is impenetrable and
[51:39] Joshua knew that the city was
[51:42] impenetrable and he knew he was facing
[51:44] this wall and you know brothers and
[51:46] sisters it sure sounds like a lot of
[51:48] times in our lives
[51:50] because we constantly are looking ahead
[51:53] of the challenges that we face
[51:56] you know tomorrow what challenge could
[51:58] lay ahead of you I know tomorrow what
[52:01] challenge could lay ahead of me
[52:03] sometimes those challenges are difficult
[52:05] sometimes those challenges are
[52:07] frightening sometimes those challenges
[52:09] uh give us a feeling of great
[52:10] uncertainty in our lives
[52:12] because we know that something is about
[52:15] to happen and we need God we need God to
[52:18] get us through and we look here at this
[52:20] wall ahead of us and we wonder how are
[52:22] we ever going to break through this
[52:24] this wall is too big it's too we can't
[52:27] get through it we can't get over it we
[52:29] can't get under it I'm standing here
[52:31] looking at a challenge that I cannot
[52:33] defeat
[52:36] here's God's plan
[52:39] delivered to Joshua Joshua wondered what
[52:41] what in the world's next what are we
[52:43] going to do here how are we going to how
[52:45] are we going through this city
[52:48] you know God's plan wasn't a plan to
[52:50] rush in there and and and try to
[52:52] surprise them and take them by take them
[52:54] by force and rush into the City and say
[52:56] oh here we are we're here to attack
[52:59] but a lot of times we in our lives we
[53:01] try to fight our battles that way we try
[53:04] to get in a hurry we try to rush and
[53:06] God's on my side so here we are let's
[53:08] fight
[53:10] if Joshua and the children of Israel had
[53:12] went up there and stormed that City
[53:14] if they would have went up there and
[53:15] stormed that City and think they're
[53:17] going to take it by force the the death
[53:19] toll would have been innumerable
[53:21] they would have been slaughtered one
[53:23] after another after another after
[53:24] another but God didn't do that God told
[53:27] Jose Joshua March around the city once a
[53:30] day for six days
[53:33] slow down
[53:35] March around the city uh for six days
[53:38] and then uh and then March around seven
[53:40] times on the seventh day see God's plan
[53:42] always involves preparation
[53:45] and the time of sanctification cleaning
[53:48] and so God here is now trying to get to
[53:50] get them ready and brother sister that's
[53:52] the way it is in our hour with the bride
[53:54] the bride is taking time right now she's
[53:57] preparing herself
[53:59] and I know we've heard we've heard that
[54:01] for years but if you look at what's
[54:03] happening in the world if you look at
[54:05] what's happening in the church world if
[54:07] you look at what's happening in the
[54:08] message world
[54:11] we're here
[54:13] we're on the brink of something that the
[54:16] world has dreamed of that the world has
[54:18] anticipated that the world has known and
[54:21] is going to expect to happen for the
[54:23] whole time that Christ has been gone
[54:25] Christ is coming back and we're in
[54:27] anticipation for it
[54:30] here Joshua tells the priest to carry
[54:33] the Ark of the Covenant
[54:35] carry the Ark of the Covenant and and
[54:37] have your armed men before and go and
[54:39] have your arm in Africa why would you
[54:41] think he would do that I think God
[54:43] wanted to let it be known to the whole
[54:45] Jericho City that here is God's anointed
[54:50] people
[54:51] here is God's anointed Army and we're
[54:55] standing outside of your Gates and we're
[54:58] here to take you over
[55:04] he also wanted the Israelites to see
[55:07] that the faithfulness to God's plan
[55:12] you know it may not always be in our
[55:14] timing
[55:16] but God does deliver his results
[55:26] listen and waiting on God
[55:29] that's a hard thing for us to do
[55:31] that's a hard thing for us to do we have
[55:33] a need in our life we have a challenge
[55:35] we have something that we need to happen
[55:37] it needs to happen right now in our
[55:39] minds and it's a hard thing for us to
[55:41] sit and wait
[55:43] we want instant everything's instant we
[55:46] got an instant coffee we got instant tea
[55:48] we got uh instant microwaves we got
[55:51] instant everything is instant instant
[55:53] instant
[55:54] and when we don't get things instantly
[55:56] we get discouraged we don't get things
[55:58] instantly we begin to stress when we
[56:00] gonna get things instantly we begin to
[56:02] get all worried and frazzled and think
[56:04] man how is this ever going to work out
[56:05] and Joshua's sitting here and God saw
[56:07] him March around the city
[56:09] March around the city
[56:12] March around the city
[56:14] you know brothers and sisters we already
[56:16] read how Jericho was shut down
[56:18] they were shut down they had fear upon
[56:21] them they were boarded up because Israel
[56:23] was so near they knew who Israel was
[56:26] they knew the children of God they knew
[56:29] what God was capable of you say well how
[56:31] do you know that because Rahab said in
[56:33] Chapter 2 she said We Know Who You Are
[56:37] we know who you are and I've had a
[56:39] change of heart we know the destruction
[56:41] you cause we know what you've done to
[56:43] Pharaoh we know what you've done to
[56:45] Egypt
[56:46] so they knew exactly who the children of
[56:49] Israel was as they become men and here
[56:51] they become to Simply March around the
[56:54] city
[56:55] March March March no utterance of
[56:58] anything
[57:00] March March March and can you imagine
[57:03] the the soldiers in the Jericho I can
[57:05] just think about them being up on top of
[57:07] the city walls looking down on this and
[57:09] thinking man when are they going to
[57:10] strike
[57:12] when are they going to strike what is
[57:14] their strategy what are they doing why
[57:16] are they just keep walking around where
[57:17] are they going to jump over the walls
[57:19] where where is the attack going to come
[57:21] from
[57:22] Nightfall nothing
[57:25] day two they come out and they begin to
[57:27] walk around again Walk and Walk and Walk
[57:30] and they begin to do this day after day
[57:32] after day after day now what seemed
[57:34] frightening at the first
[57:37] now turns into mockery
[57:41] can you imagine the children of Jericho
[57:43] as they watch this hey
[57:45] are you guys ever going to do anything
[57:49] why you keep walking around do you even
[57:51] have any weapons
[57:54] can you imagine as I sit there and they
[57:56] can't speak
[57:58] you know in our minds we'd be like I'll
[57:59] just show you you just wait a minute
[58:02] wait till my God comes on the same
[58:07] no they just kept walking and they keep
[58:09] mocking them hey are you guys ever gonna
[58:12] fight we're so we're soldiers we're
[58:14] ready for you we're what are you waiting
[58:16] for and they March and they March and
[58:20] they March do you see the importance of
[58:21] waiting on God
[58:24] you see God's got a plan and only the
[58:27] only way that God can fulfill his pain
[58:28] if we're willing to wait on God we have
[58:31] to wait and let God do it in his time
[58:34] but they're being made fun of and
[58:36] they're being mocked and we don't like
[58:38] that do we
[58:40] now we don't like it when people make
[58:41] fun of us when they mock us and and the
[58:43] world mocks us and and and Christianity
[58:46] is being hit so hard and and the message
[58:48] is being hit so hard the message is
[58:50] under constant scrutiny
[58:53] yep it's under constant scrutiny for
[58:55] what you believe and what you what you
[58:57] live
[58:58] the way you dress the way you act the
[59:00] way you talk
[59:01] under
[59:03] constant scrutiny and here's the
[59:05] children of Israel walking around under
[59:06] the scrutiny
[59:08] look at you
[59:09] look at you what happened to that God
[59:11] we've heard so much about was that all a
[59:14] myth about Egypt
[59:17] every day
[59:19] but unfortunately for Jericho there was
[59:22] a seventh day
[59:24] and on that seventh day it began to tell
[59:26] us that on that on that seventh day they
[59:27] marched around the city seven times
[59:30] and on the same time the priest blew the
[59:33] trumpets and Joshua said shout for the
[59:35] Lord has given you the city
[59:37] can you imagine the roar that swept
[59:41] through that little village that little
[59:42] Valley down through there on the in
[59:45] between the banks of the river of Jordan
[59:46] and the walls of the city of Jericho can
[59:49] you imagine the Roar the swept through
[59:51] there I met those soldiers didn't have
[59:53] much to say about that time because as
[59:55] that wall began to rumble and the Earth
[59:57] began to Quake at the shout and the
[59:59] sound of the trumpets
[1:00:01] and the next thing you know that wall
[1:00:03] comes down and God gave them the victory
[1:00:06] as simple as it sounds that's how simple
[1:00:09] it is in our lives sometimes we just
[1:00:12] have to stand on the word sometimes we
[1:00:13] got to keep our mouths shut sometimes we
[1:00:15] got to wait on God and then just wait
[1:00:17] and let God do his thing
[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:23] these people went up into the city
[1:00:26] I like this part the people went up into
[1:00:28] the City and every man straight before
[1:00:31] himself he went up there and took the
[1:00:33] city you know because before it was all
[1:00:35] Moses
[1:00:37] right
[1:00:38] they followed Moses they done what Moses
[1:00:40] said Moses was the leader Moses was the
[1:00:42] one that was looked up to next it was
[1:00:45] yahshua Joshua was the next leader he
[1:00:47] was the next one that they looked up to
[1:00:49] he'd done his part he was powerful but
[1:00:52] now it says they each and every one of
[1:00:55] them went up into the oh they were
[1:00:57] everyday Believers brothers and sisters
[1:00:59] everyday Believers Housewives men
[1:01:02] farmers
[1:01:05] they all went up there they all had
[1:01:07] their part in this battle under the
[1:01:09] leadership of God
[1:01:10] now they have taken it upon them they
[1:01:14] have a part they have a plan they have a
[1:01:16] part in this plan of God and brother
[1:01:18] sisters we need people to realize and
[1:01:20] know their part in the plan of God
[1:01:23] we need Warriors Prayer Warriors people
[1:01:25] women men children who will get a list
[1:01:28] of the prayer needs and dedicate
[1:01:30] themselves to pray and pray and pray
[1:01:33] pray for the Saints pray for the
[1:01:35] services
[1:01:37] pray for God's moving in our midst we
[1:01:40] need people we need singers who are
[1:01:41] anointed to sing the Praises of God to
[1:01:44] our anointed that can bring down the
[1:01:46] anointing of God into our song services
[1:01:48] and into
[1:01:50] to the lives of the young people and the
[1:01:52] children and people in this church so
[1:01:54] that if God becomes real and they can
[1:01:56] enter into a place of worship that's
[1:01:58] what we call tearing down walls
[1:02:04] these people of Jericho they saw God's
[1:02:07] power in an instant
[1:02:09] we want instant they got instant the
[1:02:11] people of Jericho now knew that there
[1:02:13] was a god they knew that God could
[1:02:15] deliver and they knew as these walls
[1:02:17] come tumbling down oh what a great God
[1:02:19] this is oh what a great God they serve
[1:02:22] and this is a great story not just for
[1:02:25] them but for us
[1:02:27] it's a great story that leads us into
[1:02:29] victory
[1:02:34] there's some keys Into the Book of
[1:02:37] Joshua that I want to look at that we've
[1:02:39] been talking about over the last little
[1:02:42] bit
[1:02:43] Joshua 1 3 we've learned to step out on
[1:02:46] faith
[1:02:48] 1-3 says to every place of your father
[1:02:50] that your foot walks the soul
[1:02:53] s your foot she'll walk there upon your
[1:02:55] own
[1:02:57] Joshua 1 8 says meditate on God's word
[1:02:59] meditate therein day and night how much
[1:03:01] more important is that for us to get in
[1:03:03] the word day in and day night
[1:03:06] Joshua 1 9 says don't be afraid be
[1:03:09] strong of good courage be not afraid
[1:03:11] because God is with you
[1:03:14] we've learned in these little things
[1:03:15] we've heard them but now it's time to
[1:03:17] apply them Joshua 3 3 put God first the
[1:03:20] Ark of the Covenant go after it
[1:03:22] let the presence of God go before you
[1:03:29] have a fresh encounter with Christ
[1:03:30] Joshua 5 14. Joshua falls on his face
[1:03:35] and worships
[1:03:37] trusting God for a miracle Joshua 6 5
[1:03:40] Shout with a great shout in the wall of
[1:03:42] the city shall fall flat down
[1:03:46] so it's time to take these things to
[1:03:48] Heart take these words to heart we read
[1:03:50] in the Book of Joshua we read about how
[1:03:52] after they conquer Jericho it was an
[1:03:55] easy win
[1:03:56] do you ever think about how easy that
[1:03:58] wind was
[1:04:00] 13 times they walked around the city in
[1:04:02] seven days and the walls tumbled down
[1:04:05] nobody hurt nobody killed they take the
[1:04:07] city they burn the city they get the
[1:04:09] spoils
[1:04:12] everything's good but what we fail to
[1:04:14] realize and what we failed to remember
[1:04:15] sometimes is that that wasn't their last
[1:04:18] battle
[1:04:19] they didn't stop in Jericho
[1:04:22] do you know they took over 30 more
[1:04:24] cities they took over 30 more cities and
[1:04:27] had 30 more victories day after day
[1:04:29] there was something constantly they were
[1:04:31] having to battle and they went and they
[1:04:33] took these cities some of them were hard
[1:04:35] fought battles some of them were
[1:04:38] injuries sustained some of them death
[1:04:40] was the same
[1:04:42] but the victory was still God's
[1:04:45] you see you may be facing challenges in
[1:04:47] your life in my life I face them
[1:04:50] and when I think about this story it
[1:04:52] reminds me
[1:04:54] that just like the children children of
[1:04:56] Israel with God going before me I cannot
[1:05:00] fail
[1:05:01] with God going before you you cannot
[1:05:04] fail you can have the victory brother
[1:05:06] Brown said notice he said I want you to
[1:05:08] notice that Joshua had a Victory Day at
[1:05:10] the river Joshua had a Victory Day at
[1:05:13] the river he said he had a Victory Day
[1:05:15] at the Jericho too he certainly did
[1:05:17] there is where he crops and he had that
[1:05:20] Victory Day in the month of April when
[1:05:22] it was a mile across he said no doubt
[1:05:25] the enemy would have said God is quite a
[1:05:27] general isn't he leads his army up to
[1:05:29] that River when it's at its worst
[1:05:32] he said and when it's the worst time to
[1:05:34] cross then God the general leads his
[1:05:37] army up there to let him cross
[1:05:39] he said God lets disappointments happen
[1:05:46] we don't like that
[1:05:47] [Applause]
[1:05:49] we don't like that but he says God lets
[1:05:52] those disappointments happen to show
[1:05:55] victory
[1:06:00] if I could only see that he said if you
[1:06:03] could only see it seems to be blurring
[1:06:05] you and upsetting you their trials he
[1:06:08] said they are things to stand still and
[1:06:10] focus your glasses on the word of God
[1:06:12] speak the word and then just walk
[1:06:15] forward
[1:06:18] let me tell you there's many times in
[1:06:20] our lives we don't have the answer
[1:06:23] we don't know what to do
[1:06:26] there's times when we just sit there and
[1:06:27] we think Lord I'm in a pickle
[1:06:30] I'm I'm just like Joshua I done found
[1:06:32] myself in a tight spot
[1:06:35] and we said and we wonder how are we
[1:06:37] going to get through
[1:06:39] that's when we have to stop and say God
[1:06:41] I Lay My Life down to you
[1:06:44] I lay my everything down to you and I
[1:06:47] dedicate myself to you and however we
[1:06:49] get through this you'll get the glory
[1:06:51] you'll get the victory
[1:06:53] he says
[1:06:55] Israel went to battle the first thing
[1:06:57] they went forth was singers and singers
[1:06:59] went forward they blowed the trumpet so
[1:07:01] we need singers we need trumpets we need
[1:07:03] musicians he said they blow the trumpets
[1:07:05] and so forth the art moved up he said
[1:07:08] the art moved up they set the ark down
[1:07:10] and the battle started
[1:07:12] he said God told him as I was with Moses
[1:07:15] so I will be with you and there you are
[1:07:18] with a commission from God put the word
[1:07:21] first and it brought a victory day oh
[1:07:24] it's got to come he said he put the word
[1:07:26] first and what happened the ark went
[1:07:29] down into the water and the river opened
[1:07:31] up and they crossed
[1:07:33] he said
[1:07:34] what happens when I get there the next
[1:07:36] thing they're going to take place he
[1:07:37] gets over there on the other side then
[1:07:38] he finds out they're all walled in
[1:07:40] because of the fear when it comes over
[1:07:43] him but the next thing he met the chief
[1:07:46] if we can just get in contact with the
[1:07:48] chief Captain when our battles are
[1:07:51] raging when things are not going our way
[1:07:52] we get in contact with the chief captain
[1:07:56] he says the natural man looking through
[1:07:58] the glass there says now you brought me
[1:08:01] over here here I am look at the
[1:08:03] opposition they're on the inside they're
[1:08:05] with their slings they're close to the
[1:08:08] wall woe unto us they got rocks they got
[1:08:11] big slings they got Spears they got bows
[1:08:13] they got everything laying in there
[1:08:15] but Joshua just put God first
[1:08:18] and isn't that how you're going to get
[1:08:21] there that's up to God just keep moving
[1:08:24] and following he said March seven days
[1:08:27] and on the seventh day March seven times
[1:08:29] and the last time around sound the
[1:08:32] trumpet God's place to take the natural
[1:08:35] way and the spiritual moved in the walls
[1:08:39] fell they went right straight up and
[1:08:41] they took the thing yes sir they had
[1:08:44] their Victory Day
[1:08:46] aren't you thankful for the victory days
[1:08:48] of sand to our feet
[1:08:58] simple thought tonight but as we bring
[1:09:00] the walls down take it home with you and
[1:09:03] when you're challenged in this next week
[1:09:04] and you don't know which way to turn in
[1:09:06] your walls and your chasing
[1:09:08] facing obstacles remember these
[1:09:11] scriptures or remember that it didn't
[1:09:12] take a a mighty Army full of Weaponry it
[1:09:15] didn't take a mighty Army to come in and
[1:09:18] destroy the the Jericho soldiers and to
[1:09:21] bring the walls down it just simply took
[1:09:23] a a man and women and children of God to
[1:09:26] walk and to walk into God's plan
[1:09:30] follow God's word
[1:09:33] and keep
[1:09:34] beef God first let's pray Heavenly
