[29:59] and verse we'll just read one for now i

[30:02] out of this verse 12
[30:05] chapter 12 verse 21
[30:11] be not overcome of evil
[30:14] but overcome evil with good
[30:18] amen may god has blessings to the
[30:20] reading of the words you can be seated
[30:21] tonight
[30:26] lord laid a little thought on my heart
[30:28] to speak on and so as i begin to study
[30:31] and
[30:31] look into it and see what some of the
[30:34] things that brother brahm talked about
[30:36] it but he said he said this in
[30:39] the book of exodus chicago illinois
[30:42] illinois
[30:43] 1955. he says now we find
[30:46] out that there was three great
[30:49] principles that we were going to talk
[30:50] about
[30:51] or talk on and this book of exodus
[30:53] called out
[30:54] separated and also a book of redemption
[30:57] and the three principles he says that we
[30:59] was going to talk on was
[31:00] this is going to be our subject it's the
[31:02] power of the devil
[31:04] and the power of god amen also in
[31:08] between there he has and the power of
[31:10] faith
[31:11] the power of the devil the power of
[31:13] faith and the power of god
[31:15] amen so we want to just talk about that
[31:17] with the help of the lord for a little
[31:18] while
[31:19] amen uh this evening with his help
[31:24] amen brother madam he
[31:28] makes a statement in the greatest battle
[31:29] ever fought he says you know
[31:32] satan he says his power that he's got
[31:37] is a perverted power of god
[31:40] it's not real power
[31:44] it's not power amen
[31:47] it's just a perversion of god's power
[31:51] so everything that uh
[31:54] everything that surrounds and everything
[31:56] the devil has
[31:57] brother brown says everything that he
[31:59] has the only thing he has
[32:00] to work with is perversion
[32:04] is twisting something you know
[32:07] manipulative cunning
[32:11] as a matter of fact one of the devils
[32:13] we're going to talk about him for just a
[32:14] little bit
[32:15] but before i before i say that before i
[32:18] go into that one of
[32:19] i want to just talk about the devil's i
[32:22] guess
[32:22] two main uh it's actually
[32:26] there's a look there's a few more but we
[32:28] could mention three
[32:29] his three main uh
[32:33] powers that he has that he works with
[32:36] but brother batman the greatest battle
[32:37] ever fought he says
[32:39] something we've heard before but i want
[32:40] to say it again you know we've heard of
[32:43] wars and rumors of wars and if your
[32:45] stance will have plenty more wars
[32:47] but you realize that there's really only
[32:49] two powers
[32:50] in the universe all of the differences
[32:54] between the nations
[32:55] and difference between each other and
[32:56] everything it all amounts to two powers
[33:00] there's only two powers and there's only
[33:03] two kingdoms
[33:04] two powers and two kingdoms and all the
[33:06] rest of these little things
[33:08] these minor things that are connected
[33:11] with either one of those powers
[33:12] and we'll get into some of those minor
[33:15] things with the help of the lord tonight
[33:16] we want to talk about some of those
[33:18] minor things what we would call minor
[33:20] things that's connected
[33:21] to these powers all right and those
[33:24] powers is god's power
[33:26] and satan's power amen every war
[33:30] every disorder everything that comes
[33:32] along it's either controlled
[33:34] by god's power or satan's power amen and
[33:37] so as i
[33:38] like i said i just for some reason it
[33:39] just was kind of laid on my heart to
[33:41] talk about
[33:42] then you know one of the main things i
[33:44] guess when i begin the
[33:46] lord begin to bring this to me was and i
[33:49] didn't get time today or didn't
[33:51] didn't get to it uh into church age book
[33:54] and where he talks about the satan
[33:55] uses diabolical power political power
[33:59] spiritual power uh spirit uh spiritual
[34:02] power like in
[34:03] spirituality and and so forth he has
[34:06] three different
[34:06] you know powers different powers that
[34:08] the devil uses
[34:10] and so but anyway so he says
[34:13] he says every little thing is either
[34:15] controlled by god's power or
[34:17] satan's power because there's only two
[34:20] that's the only two powers that there is
[34:25] amen and that is the power of life
[34:28] and the power of death amen
[34:32] now that's the only two powers but evan
[34:34] says there's no other
[34:35] powers every little detail is connected
[34:38] to one
[34:39] or the other and you know and satan can
[34:43] only now notice he's a perverter of
[34:44] god's power
[34:45] it's not real power it's a perverted
[34:47] power of god everything that satan hath
[34:49] death is only
[34:51] now he mentions death is only a
[34:54] perverted life
[34:56] a lie is only the truth missed told amen
[34:59] that's some of the things i want to
[35:00] start with
[35:01] adult is a actual correct act misused
[35:05] a righteous act misused everything that
[35:08] satan's got
[35:09] is something that was perverted but it's
[35:11] a power
[35:13] that's all the devil has to work with
[35:14] that's the only power that he has
[35:16] amen he has he doesn't now let me just
[35:19] bring this in
[35:20] how many knows it god's power what is
[35:23] god's power
[35:25] there's only you know there's one power
[35:28] satan can intimidate or not intimidate
[35:30] but impersonate
[35:32] almost anything is that right you can
[35:34] impersonate
[35:35] almost anything but the one statement
[35:37] that brother bannon made about
[35:39] about this the devil is that one power
[35:41] that he doesn't have
[35:42] what's what
[35:46] yeah your mic is still on by the way
[35:48] brother david very good
[35:49] yeah creative power amen
[35:53] it's creative god has creative power
[35:56] amen
[35:57] you might want to leave that on i need a
[35:58] lot of amen tonight
[36:03] oh yeah yeah y'all need to that was just
[36:05] the least
[36:06] of it amen praise the lord so create
[36:10] i mean that's the good part about god is
[36:12] that he's a god
[36:14] that his power can actually create amen
[36:18] that's real power is to be able to
[36:20] create something
[36:21] out of nothing amen
[36:26] something out of nothing
[36:30] praise the lord so he says one more
[36:33] statement here i want to make on this
[36:34] quote
[36:35] everything is satan's god is something
[36:37] that was perverted but it's a power
[36:39] and we are today sitting here
[36:42] and wanna one or the other power
[36:46] is going to control us amen
[36:49] can i rephrase that just a little bit
[36:52] let me rephrase that
[36:54] just a little bit
[36:57] and that is he says
[37:01] and one of those powers is going to
[37:04] control us i'm going to say that one of
[37:05] those
[37:06] powers is controlling us
[37:11] amen presently
[37:14] you're either controlled by one of those
[37:16] power or the other
[37:18] as you're sitting there as you're
[37:20] listening
[37:22] right now you're controlled by either
[37:25] satan's power god problem
[37:27] and if you just remember this no matter
[37:29] how much you say if you haven't got the
[37:31] holy ghost
[37:32] and if you're not controlled by god's
[37:33] power even your thinking is not
[37:36] right am i right
[37:39] even the way that you think in the way
[37:41] that you look at things it's not going
[37:42] to be correct
[37:44] because you can only think right amen
[37:48] you can only react right if you have
[37:50] god's power in you
[37:53] that's the truth you're going to think
[37:54] the wrong thoughts
[37:56] you're going to be negative you're going
[37:57] to be you know you're going to be
[37:59] doubtful you're going to be unbelieving
[38:01] you know
[38:02] if you're controlled by the devil's
[38:04] power
[38:05] amen so
[38:09] now how many knows that there was a time
[38:11] for
[38:13] 4 000 years for 4 000 years sure
[38:18] men were temporarily anointed by god's
[38:21] spirit
[38:21] isn't that right sure david was
[38:24] temporarily anointed samson was
[38:26] temporarily anointed the spirit would
[38:28] come upon him
[38:29] bible said right and he'd slay a
[38:31] thousand philistines and so forth
[38:33] but when it's all said and done even
[38:35] samson would go back to the wrong
[38:37] actions
[38:39] he would go back to his carnal nature
[38:42] and that right he lead to delilah
[38:44] david as holy and as a good a man as he
[38:47] was
[38:48] he still had a beth sheba an affair not
[38:51] right
[38:52] he was still a murderer
[38:55] and also you know he he just didn't have
[38:59] what it took to overcome
[39:03] that right that's why we started with
[39:05] that that scripture that talks about you
[39:07] know we're supposed to
[39:09] overcome evil
[39:12] be not overcome by evil but overcome
[39:15] evil
[39:16] and for thou 4 000 years humanity
[39:20] couldn't truly experience
[39:23] the power of god they didn't know what
[39:27] it was
[39:27] really all about what it really was
[39:31] to have the power of god
[39:36] because we know as the prophet of god
[39:38] said you know that it is very
[39:40] evident without question that the power
[39:44] is not just immensely not
[39:47] enormously not greatly but
[39:51] unspeakably unfathomably greater
[39:56] and more powerful than the power of
[39:58] satan
[40:00] it's not even the same running is that
[40:03] right
[40:04] why because oh my i mean
[40:08] you know sometimes satan well
[40:12] he just looks kind of foolish
[40:15] all right because you would think that
[40:18] he would know that he's never going to
[40:19] outdo god
[40:21] right but remember pharaoh the devil was
[40:25] in pharaoh to kill all of those babies
[40:27] because the king was gonna
[40:28] deliver was supposed to be war he
[40:30] thought he could wipe them out
[40:34] when the israelites talk about you know
[40:36] where is he that is born
[40:38] king of the jews well herod and them
[40:39] went kill all them baby
[40:41] trying to wipe them out come on people
[40:44] we all know that no matter what you do
[40:47] devil i'm sure the devil knows it but i
[40:49] don't know why it keeps trying but he
[40:51] does
[40:52] amen the devil is more of a go-getter
[40:56] sometimes than we are
[40:58] he knows he's defeated but he still
[40:59] don't quit
[41:03] you know a lot of times a christian man
[41:05] will act like we're defeated but we
[41:06] don't want to quit because we want to
[41:08] win but the devil he knows he's defeated
[41:10] and he keeps trying
[41:12] amen and so you know he he
[41:16] he's got to realize he's got to know
[41:18] that god is more powerful than he is
[41:21] and that he's going to have an angel
[41:22] tell joseph look just take mary and go
[41:24] over to bethlehem and go over to here
[41:26] you know right you know so that he
[41:28] doesn't get caught in it
[41:30] doesn't take a whole lot god just
[41:31] maneuvers around it
[41:34] because god's power is so much greater
[41:37] than the devil's power it doesn't matter
[41:39] on what level or what you're talking
[41:41] about
[41:43] whatever the devil offers whatever the
[41:45] devil
[41:46] comes up against you know and i believe
[41:48] there's a scripture says that no
[41:49] weapon formed against thee shall stand
[41:52] no matter what the devil brings against
[41:54] you
[41:55] there is a power greater than whatever
[41:57] it is that he brings against you
[42:04] amen so man was without this power man
[42:08] did without this power sure god would
[42:11] display himself and he would use
[42:13] deliverers and so forth
[42:14] but man in general and even though great
[42:17] people ended up
[42:18] amen not having what it took in here to
[42:22] possess the power of god at all times
[42:26] now we find that in the book of acts
[42:29] that he had
[42:30] told them to wait up in the upper room
[42:33] until you are
[42:34] but wait for the promise of the father
[42:37] you know
[42:37] he says for john truly baptized with
[42:39] water but ye shall be baptized with the
[42:41] holy ghost not many days since
[42:45] and notice and he said unto them it is
[42:47] not for you to know of the times and the
[42:49] seasons which the father has put in his
[42:51] own power
[42:52] but he shall receive
[42:56] power but you shall receive
[43:00] power another i may know that after
[43:02] jesus died
[43:03] after he paid the price after he
[43:05] ascended and so forth and be just before
[43:07] he ascended
[43:08] i believe he told them to go to
[43:10] jerusalem
[43:11] go in there and wait wait there
[43:14] for the promise to be made manifest to
[43:16] you it's because something's got to
[43:19] happen just a death just a burial just a
[43:21] resurrection
[43:22] isn't enough amen
[43:25] we now want to reap the benefits of all
[43:28] of that
[43:28] by receiving the power
[43:31] receiving the holy ghost receiving what
[43:34] he died for
[43:36] ain't no no sense in buying something if
[43:38] you don't claim it if you don't purchase
[43:40] it
[43:41] if you don't use it and that's the way
[43:43] it was on the day of pentecost
[43:44] he says look i'm gonna you're gonna be
[43:46] endued with power
[43:49] from on
[43:52] praise the lord aren't you glad for that
[43:54] so it came to a place where god
[43:57] amen said look i'm gonna give you you're
[44:00] gonna have
[44:01] power amen
[44:05] the power of the holy ghost
[44:09] amen let me see here over in the book of
[44:13] saint john the first chapter
[44:19] verse 11 it says he came to his own and
[44:21] his own received him not
[44:23] but as many as received him
[44:28] to them gave he power
[44:34] power to what to become
[44:37] sons of god amen
[44:41] praise the lord i don't know i shouldn't
[44:44] go on a
[44:45] presumptuous preaching here but you know
[44:48] you know it is that this time that they
[44:50] can truly be called the sons of god
[44:53] amen in the image of god because in the
[44:55] old testament that
[44:56] didn't look a whole lot like a son of
[44:58] god the things that david did he was
[45:01] but listen he had gave him the power to
[45:03] become sons of god and to look
[45:05] like god to act like god to be in the
[45:08] image of god
[45:09] amen he gave him power to act like god
[45:13] to be in his image to be an
[45:14] amateur god amen
[45:18] amen how many knows one of the weapons
[45:21] one of the chief weapons that the devil
[45:23] has to use
[45:25] in a man is his mind
[45:30] he got to figure it out and you better
[45:32] figure this out
[45:34] you better you know reason isn't it
[45:38] reasonable
[45:39] he uses his head the devil does but
[45:42] god what where does he use
[45:45] he uses the heart why because the heart
[45:49] trusts and have faith in god and it's
[45:52] operated by something more than what you
[45:54] can figure out
[45:57] huh or that you can make happen by your
[45:59] mind
[46:01] but that's all the devil has he devil
[46:03] uses a man said
[46:04] god uses a man's heart because that's
[46:06] where the dwelling place of god is
[46:10] amen as long as god's not in there
[46:13] how many knows evil is going to be in
[46:16] there
[46:17] that's right evil is going to be in
[46:19] there as long as god
[46:21] isn't on the throne room of everybody's
[46:24] heart
[46:26] he gave him power to become sons of god
[46:29] even to them that believe on
[46:33] his name
[46:36] praise be to god
[46:39] amen now we all know that man is
[46:42] controlled by
[46:43] only two things one or the other and
[46:46] that is faith or doubt
[46:48] and that right if you are controlled by
[46:51] faith you're going to be controlled by
[46:54] creative power you're going to be
[46:56] controlled by everything that's
[46:59] good but if you are
[47:02] controlled and if you are operated by
[47:04] unbelief remember
[47:06] satan is your god satan is your
[47:10] ruler and he will take you to the pit
[47:13] of death everything that is
[47:17] evil everything that is terrible
[47:21] huh is what she's going to govern it's
[47:23] going to control you
[47:25] if you allow doubt to govern you
[47:29] amen i like that song that y'all saying
[47:32] we're living
[47:32] by faith i mean believe we're living by
[47:36] faith
[47:37] and i feel no alarm amen
[47:41] let's look at a couple things come with
[47:43] those small details the probably god
[47:44] talked about
[47:46] amen one of them is satan and i
[47:49] picked this back ups three things i
[47:51] mentioned to you one of them
[47:53] amen is satan under his power
[47:58] amen one of the great powers that he
[48:00] uses
[48:01] is deception
[48:05] all right one of his main powers
[48:08] is deception okay deception
[48:11] is something that looks like something
[48:13] that it is but it's not
[48:16] it's deceiving it's not what it claims
[48:18] to be it's not what it really
[48:20] is acting like that's why it comes as an
[48:22] angel of light
[48:25] and the scripture that comes to my mind
[48:27] is over in revelation where it talks
[48:28] about
[48:29] he deceiveth the whole world
[48:33] is that right amen he deceives
[48:36] all whose names are not written in the
[48:39] lamb of book of life
[48:42] amen he receives all he's a he's a
[48:45] shrewd
[48:45] deceiver amen because deception
[48:49] is the perversion of truth
[48:54] is that right deception is the
[48:56] perversion of truth
[48:58] that's exactly what he did in the garden
[49:01] of eden with
[49:02] eve he took the truth and perverted it
[49:06] and he deceived eve by adding
[49:09] one word
[49:12] huh he said you shall
[49:16] you're going to be like gods
[49:19] you're going to be like god you're going
[49:21] to be godly
[49:24] you're going to be like god and you're
[49:25] going to know good and evil god knows
[49:27] that you don't know good and evil right
[49:28] now
[49:29] but if you take up this fruit you're
[49:30] going to know good and evil
[49:32] and guess what you're not really going
[49:34] to die
[49:37] huh all he changed was one word he's the
[49:42] master of deception
[49:44] that's one of his main tools is
[49:47] deception
[49:50] and believe me i truly believe this
[49:54] and that is that there's going to be
[49:57] more people
[50:00] go to hell that are deceived and thought
[50:03] they were writing work
[50:05] then it is just a common sinner out
[50:07] there knows where he's going
[50:11] huh i know that's a strong statement but
[50:14] i believe it
[50:16] because most people are religious
[50:19] look at the religious world out there
[50:24] i mean it's bright something to be able
[50:26] to drive by the baptist
[50:29] methodist amish mennonite all these
[50:32] churches
[50:33] that you're going to go by when i drive
[50:35] by those churches
[50:36] and i see it maybe if the parking lot
[50:38] full i realize what god said about him
[50:41] that they're dead huh
[50:45] how many know they're dead even
[50:48] pentecostal huh but iran says even the
[50:51] pentecostals are dead
[50:54] they're dead they're spiritually dead
[50:55] they're still going to church they're
[50:56] they're still worshipping
[50:57] they still claim to worship god but
[50:59] they're dead
[51:01] why because just like jesus came and
[51:04] they rejected him
[51:06] crucified him isn't that right didn't
[51:09] barely even know he was here brother
[51:10] brown says now watch out
[51:12] in the angelus temple in in in laws in
[51:14] los angeles and california
[51:16] he says you know the same thing could
[51:17] happen and it did
[51:20] isn't that right jesus came and they
[51:22] crucified him the second time
[51:24] they got indicted for they were guilty
[51:26] of the second crucifixion
[51:28] kicked him out of the doors and didn't
[51:30] even know it
[51:33] blind deceived
[51:36] huh
[51:40] amen lord help us lord don't let me be
[51:43] deceived
[51:46] show me my faults show me where i am
[51:48] lord keep me alive in you
[51:50] why because there's a lot more people
[51:52] that are a lot of people dead and don't
[51:54] know it
[51:56] deceive deception
[52:00] of course the second one of the main
[52:01] things brother branham said
[52:03] amen that the devil uses was reasoning
[52:06] isn't that right
[52:07] one of his main tactics is reasoning he
[52:10] gets people to reason with their mind
[52:12] contrary to the word of god amen
[52:16] brother madam realized and i believe it
[52:18] was um
[52:19] uh well i don't know if i can think of
[52:22] it but
[52:23] uh he he made a challenge faith
[52:26] he's either faith or reasoning
[52:30] forget the title of the message but
[52:33] anyway
[52:33] so reasoning is one of his wayne weapons
[52:36] but i want to not so much talk about
[52:38] reasoning tonight
[52:39] as i want to talk about the opposite of
[52:41] god's
[52:42] number one weapon all right
[52:46] or power god's number one
[52:50] power the main thing
[52:53] that god uses to defeat the devil with
[52:57] all right one of his main weapons
[53:02] because even faith it's it's it's one of
[53:05] the main weapon but it's not the main
[53:06] weapon
[53:08] because the bible says that even if even
[53:10] faith
[53:11] is governed by something there's a
[53:15] governor to your faith
[53:17] because key people can have faith to
[53:18] move mountains isn't that right paul
[53:20] said
[53:21] but if i don't have
[53:24] love i'm still nothing
[53:28] amen so that love is the number one
[53:31] weapon
[53:32] that god uses in his economy and that's
[53:35] what he defeated the devil with on
[53:36] calvary
[53:37] for god so the world
[53:41] that he gave his only begotten son and
[53:43] overcome why it was love
[53:45] that drove him i want you to know
[53:48] something that you're not going to have
[53:49] any oh my
[53:51] listen to me if you don't have that
[53:53] number one weapon of love
[53:55] in your heart remember every other evil
[53:58] thing can creep in
[54:00] but you have got to keep that number one
[54:03] thing in there why do you think mother
[54:04] brahman says when you when you come
[54:05] beyond the curtain of time i don't get
[54:07] what you're doing how many religious
[54:08] demonstrations okay how much mission
[54:10] everywhere i don't care about any of
[54:12] this you make sure you have that one
[54:13] thing
[54:15] is that right and that is perfect love
[54:19] y'all remember the story of the
[54:21] pentecostal man that came
[54:22] to brother benham says brother baby i
[54:24] need you to help me out pray for me here
[54:26] because
[54:27] i got saved but my wife ain't saved and
[54:29] i'll tell you what she's got a devil on
[54:31] her and i pray for her and i'm trying to
[54:34] cast the devil out of her
[54:35] huh that right
[54:40] what was it he said buy her some flowers
[54:43] or some candy
[54:47] can you imagine that man here i've been
[54:49] praying i've been having
[54:51] faith in god hallelujah my wife is going
[54:54] to get big that we're going to get rid
[54:56] of that unbelieving devil
[54:57] huh well i'm not so sure honey that your
[55:00] religion is right you know
[55:01] this idea i'll tell you right now you
[55:03] need a conversion you know you got the
[55:05] devil
[55:06] on you huh well honey i don't know for
[55:10] sure why but i just don't know well
[55:11] i'll get that done doubting spirit off
[55:14] of you and that right
[55:16] got all dogmatic about it probably
[55:19] brother bam says to go buy some candy or
[55:21] some flowers
[55:22] isn't that right show her what
[55:27] that's right amen if i'm not wrong he
[55:30] went and did that and he transformed his
[55:32] life
[55:32] transformed his marriage why because he
[55:35] used the right weapon
[55:39] amen that's our most powerful weapon i
[55:42] want to you know i want
[55:43] i want us to know tonight i want the
[55:45] people out there on radio land to know
[55:47] that if a church of evening like that if
[55:49] we don't love each other we ain't got
[55:52] nothing
[55:55] if we don't care about each other we
[55:56] ain't got nothing
[55:58] we wouldn't go out of our way for each
[56:00] other we ain't got nothing
[56:03] we ain't a church like we ought to be
[56:05] amen
[56:07] how many believes we need more of the
[56:08] love of god in our heart
[56:10] so the opposite of god's great weapon is
[56:14] what
[56:18] that's correct sister becky you got it
[56:19] right on the hit the nail right on the
[56:20] head
[56:21] hey that's right
[56:25] now we could go into the church age book
[56:26] we could tell you how what brother
[56:28] bannon said how that
[56:29] you have no idea all right you just
[56:32] don't
[56:33] realize how much the devil operates
[56:36] and those that are possessed with his
[56:39] spirit
[56:40] operate by hate
[56:44] all right a hatred satan has a real
[56:49] hatred for christians amen
[56:54] that's right he has a real hatred for a
[56:56] real christian
[56:58] and he is driven by the hatred let me
[57:01] tell you something
[57:02] that's why 68 million
[57:05] christians went to the slaughter
[57:10] can you imagine how much blood that is
[57:14] because satan hates
[57:17] because he doesn't have the love of god
[57:20] and one of his main weapons one of the
[57:24] main
[57:25] tools and one of the main powers of the
[57:28] devil
[57:29] is the power of hate
[57:32] amen
[57:36] satan hates god
[57:40] he hates him and he hates his people
[57:44] there's a disdain so much until he
[57:47] wouldn't hesitate
[57:49] to kill us he didn't back then
[57:53] hello people today devil possess
[57:57] wouldn't hesitate
[57:59] to kill god's people amen
[58:02] sure wouldn't all right
[58:08] we find picking back up and we'll talk
[58:10] maybe pick up hate for just a minute but
[58:12] let's go back here to the garden of eden
[58:16] how many knows that one of the first
[58:18] things
[58:19] that adam and eve lost after the fall
[58:24] was love
[58:28] they lost love now how many knows that
[58:32] the minute you get away from god the
[58:34] demented the holy spirit
[58:36] leave your heart all right
[58:40] love goes out with it the holy spirit is
[58:44] love
[58:46] the bible says god is love
[58:49] he that says that he knows god and
[58:51] doesn't have love is a liar
[58:54] you can't know god and not have love in
[58:56] your heart
[58:57] you can't have god and not have love in
[59:00] your heart the bible says
[59:01] because god is love that is god god is
[59:05] love
[59:06] so adam and eve one of the first thing
[59:07] the reason i know this
[59:10] and the reason i pick love even though
[59:12] it doesn't say that
[59:14] but i looked at adam and eve that when
[59:17] god come walking through like he
[59:19] normally did
[59:20] and they were hey father i'll tell you
[59:23] what
[59:23] this planet you made this eaten you made
[59:26] it so awesome we have so enjoyed our day
[59:30] huh but instead of going and greeting
[59:33] them
[59:34] they went and found a big leaf behind
[59:36] the high behind
[59:38] they went in here because they were what
[59:43] afraid they were afraid
[59:47] and what brings fear a lack
[59:51] of love because remember the bible says
[59:54] to saint john there he says
[59:56] perfect love casts out
[59:59] fear it casts it out
[1:00:04] and so they must have lost their love
[1:00:06] because fear set in
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:13] when a person is deceived when the
[1:00:16] person is not right with god
[1:00:18] the other thing that sets in is
[1:00:21] condemnation
[1:00:24] condemnation how many knows what
[1:00:26] condemnation is it's where god condemns
[1:00:29] you and you feel condemned and
[1:00:30] you're not worthy you're not fit
[1:00:35] you're not fit to look at god you're not
[1:00:36] fit to talk to god
[1:00:39] amen you know in the lord i was just
[1:00:42] thinking about this today
[1:00:44] and i thought lord of all of our
[1:00:46] failures and all the things we do wrong
[1:00:48] sometimes we are so hard on ourselves
[1:00:50] that hey we think god ain't never going
[1:00:52] to forgive me god is never going to
[1:00:54] forgive me for this
[1:00:56] huh because i've done it 20 times now
[1:01:01] huh god ain't going to forget me the
[1:01:04] devil wants you to believe that god will
[1:01:06] never forgive you
[1:01:08] because if you'll ever believe that
[1:01:09] you're done he's got you
[1:01:12] you'll give up go out in the world
[1:01:15] yeah i've dealt with an adult won't
[1:01:18] mention his name but i've dealt with
[1:01:20] somebody that just thought they had done
[1:01:21] too much
[1:01:22] they just didn't know whether god would
[1:01:24] ever forgive him for what they had done
[1:01:28] but then this thought came to my mind
[1:01:29] and you judge whether it was the holy
[1:01:30] ghost
[1:01:31] bringing the thought to my mind or not
[1:01:34] but the thought came is that god asks
[1:01:37] you and me
[1:01:39] that if somebody comes and he does is
[1:01:41] wrong
[1:01:42] right 490 times
[1:01:48] in one day
[1:01:55] he asks us to do that and we know god is
[1:01:59] created and we are
[1:02:01] amen and that thought came and said lord
[1:02:04] our our lord and then like
[1:02:08] also thought of how that you know a lot
[1:02:10] of times maybe in schools and everything
[1:02:12] they'll give you so many chances you got
[1:02:14] three times you can take this test
[1:02:17] to try to drive this car right or we
[1:02:19] won't give you a license
[1:02:21] you got three times then you'll have to
[1:02:23] wait six months
[1:02:24] huh what if god was like that with us
[1:02:27] huh
[1:02:29] man god he god wants everybody to make
[1:02:32] it it's all i can figure out
[1:02:35] he is so forgiving he is so if we're
[1:02:38] just willing to repent
[1:02:41] we say god help me god help me hello
[1:02:44] i'm every time you fail every time
[1:02:48] you genuinely repent i believe god's
[1:02:50] going to forgive you
[1:02:52] it has to be genuine you know right
[1:02:56] but i thought about that i said satan's
[1:02:58] power
[1:02:59] sometimes to people is to make him
[1:03:00] believe god won't forgive them
[1:03:04] they have a guilty conscience and you
[1:03:07] should be guilty
[1:03:08] you should feel like adam and eve did
[1:03:11] condemned
[1:03:12] amen that you had a had a you know you
[1:03:15] was guilty because you had done
[1:03:16] something wrong
[1:03:18] but that's something else that that they
[1:03:20] had i just thought lord help us to
[1:03:21] realize
[1:03:22] and i thank god for that aren't you glad
[1:03:24] that god forgives you for your failed
[1:03:26] faults and failures
[1:03:28] amen what about if you drive home
[1:03:30] tonight and you go a little over the
[1:03:31] speed limit you were like you're worthy
[1:03:33] of death for that
[1:03:34] it's a sin brother bam said
[1:03:38] that's what he's had amen
[1:03:41] that goes for me it goes for everybody
[1:03:42] because i have a lead foot myself
[1:03:45] i just confess it i say lord help me i'm
[1:03:48] working on it how about you
[1:03:52] but anyway so you think about how god is
[1:03:54] how wonderful he is how forgiving he is
[1:03:57] so maybe somebody out there maybe
[1:03:58] somebody needed that to realize hey
[1:04:00] god is more forgiving than what you
[1:04:02] realize
[1:04:04] and i'll tell you this right now if god
[1:04:05] ever cut you off
[1:04:07] you ain't got a chance in the world
[1:04:11] if he ever doesn't if he ever if you
[1:04:14] ever
[1:04:14] cross the line and i believe you can
[1:04:17] i believe you can't cross the line but
[1:04:19] that's god is a judge of that
[1:04:21] and if you ever do i mean you'll be done
[1:04:24] just like that girl
[1:04:25] that deacon's father if you remember
[1:04:27] that rejected the holy spirit calling
[1:04:29] i mean god called her for that
[1:04:33] amen because he was directly speaking to
[1:04:35] her
[1:04:36] amen and she refused it and she could
[1:04:39] watch
[1:04:40] her soul fry in hell and laugh about it
[1:04:44] not have any feelings whatsoever i mean
[1:04:47] it's the holy ghost
[1:04:48] and love it actually gives you feelings
[1:04:53] i i want to play that tape again on the
[1:04:55] way back from north carolina on the way
[1:04:57] there and all the way back it was a
[1:04:59] wonderful time just to listen to tape
[1:05:00] after tape after tape
[1:05:02] but if i have talked about one place you
[1:05:03] all remember brother bam said he said
[1:05:05] you know you can talk to a person five
[1:05:06] minutes you can tell whether they got
[1:05:08] the holy ghost or not
[1:05:09] he says you can walk in a church and you
[1:05:11] can tell the atmosphere you can tell
[1:05:13] what that church is
[1:05:14] all about let a preacher come behind his
[1:05:17] pulpit and be here just a little while
[1:05:19] and he can tell what kind of church we
[1:05:20] are
[1:05:22] a minister can that's what the prophet
[1:05:24] god said i believe it
[1:05:25] because why the holy spirit is sensitive
[1:05:28] why do you think amens means something
[1:05:30] to him hallelujahs and rejoicing
[1:05:32] you know that's what creates that
[1:05:34] atmosphere the welcoming of the holy
[1:05:36] spirit
[1:05:37] welcoming god god actually inhabits the
[1:05:40] praise of his people
[1:05:41] a lot of times god don't come because
[1:05:43] nobody's praising him
[1:05:45] nobody's giving him honor and glory
[1:05:47] nobody's saying hallelujah
[1:05:48] huh nobody's pulling god just don't come
[1:05:53] because he only comes where he's wanted
[1:05:55] where it's
[1:05:56] needed amen the power
[1:06:00] of love and the power
[1:06:03] of hate amen that's the two
[1:06:06] main weapons that is the two
[1:06:10] main driving powers of the two powers
[1:06:14] god's power is the power of love satan's
[1:06:17] power is the power
[1:06:19] of hate amen because how many knows
[1:06:22] hate is very powerful amen
[1:06:25] hate and jealousy
[1:06:30] jealousy malice bitterness
[1:06:34] variance emulation wrath
[1:06:37] strife envying
[1:06:40] being around me and one remember that is
[1:06:43] nothing
[1:06:44] but the poison assets
[1:06:47] the flour so to speak that is poisoning
[1:06:50] poisonous that comes from satan's lips
[1:06:55] how is it the prophet of god said a
[1:06:57] church you know when you've got
[1:06:58] contention and strife
[1:07:00] and envying he's got
[1:07:03] the poison he said the poison the
[1:07:05] hazards of malice
[1:07:07] and strife and variants and so forth he
[1:07:09] says that's the
[1:07:10] very poisons of hell
[1:07:14] everything that's evil amen
[1:07:19] that's why paul it just comes to mind
[1:07:22] can i quickly just read this
[1:07:24] while i'm under thought that's why paul
[1:07:26] said be ye there
[1:07:28] for followers of god as dear children
[1:07:31] this is ephesians 5.
[1:07:33] as dear children walk in
[1:07:36] love
[1:07:40] as christ also has loved us and has
[1:07:42] given himself for us an offering
[1:07:44] and a sacrifice to god a sweet smelling
[1:07:48] savor
[1:07:49] what did brother adam say was uh one of
[1:07:52] the perversions of the devil
[1:07:54] between a man and a woman
[1:07:57] amen he says it's
[1:08:01] everything is fine but the if you do it
[1:08:04] in the wrong way it's fornication it's
[1:08:06] evil
[1:08:07] it's perversion god will condemn you for
[1:08:10] it
[1:08:11] paul says but fornication and all
[1:08:14] uncleanness
[1:08:16] remember this also can be spiritual
[1:08:17] fornication
[1:08:20] all uncleanness covetousness
[1:08:24] let it not be once named among you
[1:08:27] as become a saints
[1:08:31] neither filthiness nor foolish talking
[1:08:34] nor jesting which are not convenient
[1:08:37] but they're rather the giving of things
[1:08:40] for this you know that no whoremonger
[1:08:42] no unclean person or nor covetous man
[1:08:46] which is an idolater has any inheritance
[1:08:50] in the kingdom of god
[1:08:52] of christ and of god let no man deceive
[1:08:54] you with vain words for because of these
[1:08:56] things cometh the wrath of god
[1:08:59] upon the children of disobedience be not
[1:09:02] ye therefore partakers
[1:09:04] with them amen
[1:09:08] praise the lord
[1:09:11] so sin is a perversion of righteousness
[1:09:16] how many knows that's what happened in
[1:09:17] the garden of eden he caused her to
[1:09:19] disbelieve
[1:09:21] the word of god amen sin is a perversion
[1:09:25] of righteousness and it brings fear
[1:09:30] fear causes you to not have any
[1:09:33] confidence
[1:09:36] how many knows that you know many times
[1:09:39] growing up
[1:09:40] as a teenager and so forth a lot of
[1:09:42] times you have confidence
[1:09:44] problems inferior
[1:09:48] inferiority if i can say it right
[1:09:52] complexes i get furious this
[1:09:55] but you know it's wonderful when you get
[1:09:58] to the place that you are
[1:09:59] confident did you have confidence
[1:10:03] amen how many believes the holy ghost
[1:10:05] gives you confidence
[1:10:07] fear brings all kinds of things to
[1:10:10] probably god's head
[1:10:11] didn't he even say that job feared that
[1:10:14] these things were going to happen
[1:10:16] and he says because he feared they did
[1:10:21] i believe he's one of our great
[1:10:22] forefathers that said that the only
[1:10:24] thing that we have to fear
[1:10:26] is fear itself
[1:10:30] you know don't fear i'm telling you
[1:10:33] right now
[1:10:34] uh japan there was something to fear
[1:10:37] hitler
[1:10:38] was something to fear but we had to
[1:10:40] overcome
[1:10:42] our fear
[1:10:45] amen so you have to overcome fear
[1:10:47] brother madam even said you know you
[1:10:48] find out you got cancer this out of the
[1:10:50] other
[1:10:50] don't fear don't get distressed it only
[1:10:53] get worse
[1:10:55] but if you can just relax committed to
[1:10:58] god
[1:10:59] amen so what is sorrow
[1:11:03] sorrow is a perversion of joy
[1:11:08] is that right sickness
[1:11:11] is a perversion of health
[1:11:16] oh my oh my
[1:11:20] so let's stop there for a minute
[1:11:22] sickness is a perversion of health i was
[1:11:24] reading a quote i may have it in here
[1:11:26] i'm not sure but
[1:11:27] he talks let me just read it right here
[1:11:30] it is
[1:11:33] they seen your spirit work down through
[1:11:37] this last week lord seeing the secrets
[1:11:39] of the heart told
[1:11:41] diseases of their body and seeing
[1:11:44] the power of the devil
[1:11:48] he was talking about a lady one time he
[1:11:50] was saying that you're going to go
[1:11:52] completely blind the doctor says that
[1:11:54] there's something in your eye
[1:11:56] and the nerve and it's messing with that
[1:11:57] nerve and it's getting worse and worse
[1:11:59] worse until you're going to come be
[1:12:00] completely blind
[1:12:01] but ivan says that's a demon that's a
[1:12:04] devil in there it wasn't there one time
[1:12:06] it's not down here not only but it's
[1:12:08] right there and that
[1:12:09] devil he will absolutely make you
[1:12:12] completely blind
[1:12:14] if god don't come and do something
[1:12:17] the power of the devil is what brings
[1:12:20] any kind of disease or sickness that we
[1:12:23] have
[1:12:23] isn't that right how many knows it's the
[1:12:25] power of almighty god
[1:12:28] that takes that away
[1:12:31] and let me tell you something the fact
[1:12:33] that the eyes of the blind can come open
[1:12:35] the fact that you can be healed
[1:12:37] it proves that there's a body somewhere
[1:12:40] that's perfect
[1:12:41] that never does need any healing how
[1:12:43] many know
[1:12:44] it's the earnest of the resurrection
[1:12:46] healing is
[1:12:48] amen that's why when you seen on this
[1:12:50] hour how did god healed and healed and
[1:12:53] healed amen he says that's the earnest
[1:12:55] of the right it shows that there's a
[1:12:56] resurrect
[1:12:57] [Music]

[1:13:16] even said they were
[1:13:18] past having pleasure with their husband
[1:13:20] and so forth
[1:13:22] they were past that time amen many years
[1:13:26] passed the prophet
[1:13:27] took a prophet to see that their bodies
[1:13:30] were actually changed
[1:13:32] back
[1:13:36] and brother baby said what he did for
[1:13:38] them he'll do for us someday

[1:13:46] year old god took god is a creator god
[1:13:51] he's so much more powerful than the
[1:13:52] devil and god take the atoms of
[1:13:56] abraham he took the atoms of sarah
[1:13:59] and he turned him back young again
[1:14:03] if god can do that he can call to the
[1:14:05] grave and he can say
[1:14:07] bones and skin change in the moment and
[1:14:10] the twinkling of an eye
[1:14:11] come up a glorified body change right
[1:14:14] there and it'll come forth

[1:14:44] it back to the way that it was
[1:14:49] amen how many is looking forward to that

[1:17:34] angel of god is here to lead us
[1:17:36] amen and now satan you cruel ungodly

[1:17:55] shut in with god now
[1:17:56] keep believing keep believing he's right
[1:18:00] by your side the holy spirit is hanging
[1:18:02] right there
[1:18:03] by you right now praise the lord
[1:18:07] the first one of you that believes that
[1:18:09] you're healed stand
[1:18:10] to your feet and say praise be to god
[1:18:16] how many believes is that simple he
[1:18:17] wants your healing to stand up and say
[1:18:19] i'm healed
[1:18:21] praise be to god but the man says
[1:18:23] there's one
[1:18:24] there's another one there's another one
[1:18:27] that's right stand up and praise god
[1:18:30] why because the devil doesn't have a
[1:18:31] right on you that you're supposed to
[1:18:33] have
[1:18:34] power over the devil power over sickness
[1:18:37] he shall land on the sick and he shall
[1:18:39] recover
[1:18:42] brother brown says you know when the
[1:18:43] weakest christian the weakest
[1:18:45] christian amen has every devil
[1:18:49] under the soul of their feet
[1:18:54] many believes that he's supposed to be
[1:18:56] under our feet
[1:18:57] in other words all of these things you
[1:18:59] talk about all of these things
[1:19:01] attributes of unbelief she should be
[1:19:03] under our feet
[1:19:05] we should be overcome we should overcome
[1:19:09] them
[1:19:10] we're supposed to be on top of it
[1:19:13] amen i believe there's a saying that
[1:19:15] goes
[1:19:17] that's beneath you right
[1:19:20] that's beneath you brother that's
[1:19:23] beneath you
[1:19:23] sister well the devil is supposed to be
[1:19:27] beneath us all the things that we just
[1:19:31] read
[1:19:31] so forth all those things should be
[1:19:33] beneath us underneath us
[1:19:35] we're on top because remember we were
[1:19:38] captive
[1:19:39] satan held us by his power for four
[1:19:42] thousand years he held us by his power
[1:19:45] but the bible says in ephesians four he
[1:19:47] says when he ascended on high
[1:19:49] he led
[1:19:53] captivity captive
[1:19:55] [Laughter]
[1:19:58] come on folks hallelujah
[1:20:01] he all the gloom gets to go all the
[1:20:04] sorrow has to go
[1:20:05] what we don't have to have sorrow
[1:20:07] anymore god because we've got
[1:20:09] joy we don't have to deal with the
[1:20:12] perverted anymore we've got the real one
[1:20:14] joy is more powerful than sorrow amen
[1:20:19] god is good eddie
[1:20:22] all right praise the lord
[1:20:30] the holy spirit is right there amen
[1:20:35] to help us
[1:20:48] so what happened
[1:20:51] on calvary is when he
[1:20:54] grip just taken away the power of satan
[1:20:58] let me release calvary robbed the devil
[1:21:02] it stripped the devil of his power
[1:21:05] but the man makes a statement he says
[1:21:07] satan don't have one right
[1:21:09] for nothing he's only a bluff
[1:21:13] he was stripped of everything he had
[1:21:17] at calvary when jesus taken the sinner's
[1:21:21] place and died at calvary
[1:21:22] satan has no legal rights over nothing
[1:21:25] no
[1:21:26] more hallelujah
[1:21:29] but everything lays in the hands of the
[1:21:31] church
[1:21:32] and the believer that's right satan lost
[1:21:36] he's nothing but of love even death
[1:21:38] itself we're taught
[1:21:39] amen that has to bee loses his singers
[1:21:42] after having been stung
[1:21:44] amen it can't sting anymore it's lost
[1:21:47] his finger
[1:21:48] now how many knows we still die short
[1:21:50] but it's taken out the sting of it
[1:21:54] why because even brother bannon makes a
[1:21:57] statement about amen when you come down
[1:21:59] to that death
[1:22:00] when you come down to that grave and he
[1:22:02] said we might weep over our loved one as
[1:22:04] i did my wife brother madam said and so
[1:22:06] forth
[1:22:06] but that's when faith kicks in and then
[1:22:09] we know that we're gonna see him on the
[1:22:11] other side
[1:22:12] we don't sorrow as others we have no
[1:22:15] hope because even in death itself
[1:22:17] even it is defeated death itself is
[1:22:22] defeated
[1:22:24] how happy we ought to be tonight praise
[1:22:27] the lord
[1:22:29] listen god gives credit
[1:22:33] he give a real man of god gives credit
[1:22:34] to god and the truth of god's word
[1:22:37] and that at calvary the emancipation
[1:22:40] of proclamation was signed by the blood
[1:22:43] of jesus
[1:22:44] and everything that satan never did to
[1:22:47] you
[1:22:48] he was stripped of every power he had at
[1:22:52] calvary
[1:22:54] praise the lord how many believes that
[1:22:57] satan really
[1:22:58] is powerless in front of the holy spirit
[1:23:04] boy it's hard for us to believe that but
[1:23:06] it's the truth
[1:23:09] oh my i don't know if i should say it
[1:23:11] but i'm here to tell you
[1:23:12] i have seen the power of god defeat
[1:23:15] satan
[1:23:18] inaudible amount of times in my life
[1:23:23] i've seen i've seen god do it he's
[1:23:25] defeated him i've watched him defeat the
[1:23:27] devil
[1:23:28] many many times
[1:23:34] amen i'm sure you have to amen
[1:23:38] i know it's time to close but i'm just
[1:23:40] getting started
[1:23:42] praise the lord well not really
[1:23:45] amen i don't want to get started let the
[1:23:48] holy spirit just have his way in there
[1:23:50] right
[1:23:52] so not oldest every party i don't cover
[1:23:54] and we ought to tonight as his servants
[1:23:56] we stand
[1:23:58] to serve the public in the name of the
[1:24:00] lord jesus
[1:24:01] claiming to the people that the work has
[1:24:04] been finished
[1:24:06] and will be granted to whosoever will
[1:24:08] according
[1:24:09] to their faith that's what we're
[1:24:11] proclaiming
[1:24:15] devil only has what you give him
[1:24:21] he can only have what you give him
[1:24:25] he has to come hey can i have this can i
[1:24:27] have that
[1:24:28] can i have your joy can i have your
[1:24:30] peace
[1:24:31] huh you have to say yeah you can have it
[1:24:35] huh and he'll offer how many knows that
[1:24:38] one power one more
[1:24:40] power i'd like to talk to you about and
[1:24:42] that is the offerings of satan
[1:24:44] satan offers he offers you all kinds of
[1:24:47] things
[1:24:48] and i believe brother brown says if he
[1:24:49] can't uh get you to be out there a
[1:24:51] drunkard and a druggie and all a
[1:24:53] whoremonger and all of that he says
[1:24:54] he'll offer you to come to church
[1:24:56] he'll maybe perhaps make law for your
[1:24:58] deacon job or
[1:25:00] uh i don't know district presbyter or
[1:25:02] somebody in the church you can have
[1:25:04] maybe a sunday school for a sister or
[1:25:06] this that or the other and and you know
[1:25:07] be in a place where you can really be
[1:25:09] some do something for the lord
[1:25:11] he'll offer you all of that as long as
[1:25:13] he's just not born again
[1:25:16] all right he'll make you all kinds of
[1:25:17] offers
[1:25:19] he has all kinds of things he offers
[1:25:22] to try to actually make you think that
[1:25:25] you
[1:25:26] are right just like like but bam he says
[1:25:29] you know those women in that
[1:25:31] hotel they were drinking and so forth he
[1:25:32] said we're just having some clean fun
[1:25:34] huh that isn't clean fun he says whoopi
[1:25:37] this is life but abram said no it's not
[1:25:40] life it's death
[1:25:42] he makes people think that they're
[1:25:44] living when they're not when it's
[1:25:45] actually death
[1:25:47] amen let me just read this can i
[1:25:50] there's so many entertainments without
[1:25:52] money without price people spending
[1:25:54] money on all kinds of entertainments
[1:25:56] brother brandon was talking about
[1:25:57] amen and so forth he says when the holy
[1:26:00] spirit wants to give you all these
[1:26:01] things free of charge
[1:26:04] entertainments nowadays really cost you
[1:26:06] money go to disney world or any place
[1:26:08] like that amusement parks
[1:26:10] you better take a wall up full of money
[1:26:12] you're gonna have a lot you can walk out
[1:26:13] of there with a lot less of your cash
[1:26:16] you're gonna cost you people don't mind
[1:26:19] spending money
[1:26:19] bunching their money for entertainment
[1:26:22] but they sure won't want something
[1:26:23] that's free but it's much better and
[1:26:25] that's real
[1:26:27] there's so many entertaining things of
[1:26:29] our days there's so much to entice
[1:26:31] people
[1:26:32] that would be called pleasures and it's
[1:26:34] for all peoples and
[1:26:36] all ages and so forth there are the
[1:26:38] enticements for the young people the
[1:26:40] modern dancers and so forth
[1:26:42] rock and roll music and so forth it goes
[1:26:44] with it it's all enticement
[1:26:45] for entertainment and i don't care how
[1:26:48] good a home a child has been brought up
[1:26:50] in
[1:26:51] or how it's been taught to do right if
[1:26:52] that child hasn't accepted the
[1:26:54] experience of the new birth
[1:26:56] rock and roll music catches his
[1:26:58] attention as quick as he hears it
[1:27:00] because in him is born in nature
[1:27:03] a carnal spirit and the power of the
[1:27:06] devil is so great today
[1:27:08] till it catches that spirit of that
[1:27:10] little one
[1:27:11] huh is that right
[1:27:15] and how much more will it do to the old
[1:27:18] them
[1:27:19] that has rejected the new birth because
[1:27:21] only as your life
[1:27:23] is changed and you've been converted and
[1:27:27] born anew
[1:27:30] into the kingdom of god your nature
[1:27:33] will still be of the things of the world
[1:27:37] how many knows it you can hear up here
[1:27:39] preacher doesn't matter what it is
[1:27:41] you can hear you don't want to do this
[1:27:42] you don't want to do that but until your
[1:27:44] nature's changed
[1:27:46] until that desire is taken out that
[1:27:49] right
[1:27:50] you're still going to desire it it's
[1:27:52] going to be there
[1:27:54] you could worship and be religious but
[1:27:57] still
[1:27:58] that will have some kind of a drawing
[1:28:00] power to you
[1:28:01] because the old man of sin and his
[1:28:03] desires is not
[1:28:04] dead in you yet but once let christ
[1:28:07] take the throne in your heart and those
[1:28:10] things don't bother him it's so
[1:28:13] much greater amen
[1:28:16] how many is all the things that god is
[1:28:18] so much greater
[1:28:20] oh my
[1:28:25] i cannot mention closing with a story
[1:28:29] i cannot mention the man's name because
[1:28:31] i can't think of his name right now
[1:28:34] but many of you will remember him they
[1:28:36] say that there was an
[1:28:37] island where that men would go in
[1:28:40] ambush they would wait in the ambush and
[1:28:42] their women would come out
[1:28:44] singing and their songs were so
[1:28:45] tantalizing that the soldiers passing by
[1:28:48] and the ships would come in
[1:28:50] and then the ambush soldiers which catch
[1:28:52] those
[1:28:54] which catch those sailors off guard and
[1:28:56] slam
[1:28:57] and a certain great man wanted to pass
[1:29:00] by
[1:29:01] and he had his sailors to tie him up to
[1:29:03] a mass pole
[1:29:04] and put something in his mouth so that
[1:29:06] he could not scream
[1:29:08] and put plugs in the sailor's ear so
[1:29:10] that he could not hear
[1:29:12] the sailboat and sail by to hear it
[1:29:15] and the women came out dancing and
[1:29:17] screaming and singing and oh it was so
[1:29:19] great
[1:29:19] till he turned to hide on his wrist
[1:29:22] screaming to his sailors
[1:29:24] turn in and turn in
[1:29:27] but they couldn't hear him they had
[1:29:28] plugs in their ears
[1:29:30] and then he uh sailed to a certain place
[1:29:32] where they was
[1:29:34] to unmask his or untie his hands
[1:29:38] and he was to take the plugs from his
[1:29:39] ears and there
[1:29:41] when walking on down the street he heard
[1:29:43] a musician
[1:29:44] that was so far supreme to that down
[1:29:47] there
[1:29:48] that when he passed by again they said
[1:29:52] o great rover shall we tie it to the
[1:29:54] mass pole again
[1:29:56] he said no just let me lose i have heard
[1:29:59] something
[1:30:00] so much greater till that'll never
[1:30:03] bother me
[1:30:04] no more that's the way it is with the
[1:30:07] born-again christian
[1:30:09] they found something so much greater
[1:30:12] than rock and roll and entertainments
[1:30:13] of this world they are entertained by
[1:30:16] the holy spirit
[1:30:18] and it's so much greater
[1:30:22] till the world is dead to them
[1:30:26] amen how many believe that all the
[1:30:28] things of satan everything
[1:30:30] amen a tries to offer it should all be
[1:30:33] dead to us
[1:30:34] because we found something so much
[1:30:37] greater
[1:30:38] amen god bless you tonight stand with me
[1:30:40] if you win
[1:30:43] musicians if you'll come
[1:31:01] amen that's just our heads
[1:31:08] whether here or out there
[1:31:12] i wonder how many would be honest
[1:31:16] and would say brother byler i really
[1:31:20] want more of the power of god in my life
[1:31:25] i want more of the love of jesus in my
[1:31:28] soul
[1:31:29] i'm more of his faith more of his joy
[1:31:33] more of his peace more of his long
[1:31:36] suffering and gentleness
[1:31:38] meekness instead of pride
[1:31:42] god bless you god bless you lord jesus
[1:31:45] i've got my hand raised
[1:31:47] lord jesus i'm always wanting more we're
[1:31:49] always wanting more of you
[1:31:52] like the song says more of you more of
[1:31:55] you

[1:31:58] of you

[1:32:01] saturate every heart
[1:32:03] and every hand right now so much of the
[1:32:06] with the holy spirit father
[1:32:08] until it would drown everything negative
[1:32:11] anything of satan's power
[1:32:13] just crush it completely out of our life
[1:32:16] lord
[1:32:16] until in our bosom and in our hearts
[1:32:18] father there would be a real
[1:32:20] hunger and a thirst there would be a
[1:32:22] real satisfaction in our souls father
[1:32:25] with the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:32:27] with the power of god in our life lord
[1:32:29] jesus to be sons and daughters of god
[1:32:32] to live for you lord jesus to let you
[1:32:35] have control of our hearts father in our
[1:32:38] lives
[1:32:39] lord take every heart now you know every
[1:32:41] hand
[1:32:42] lord and how much more they need of you
[1:32:44] father and i pray god
[1:32:45] that you will grant them lord jesus a
[1:32:47] real filling of your spirit
[1:32:49] and of your power that would overcome
[1:32:52] all of the power that satan has
[1:32:55] and lord jesus that that the peace of
[1:32:57] god would rule
[1:32:59] and reign in every heart father
[1:33:02] that lord not fear but love would
[1:33:05] saturate
[1:33:06] every heart lord confidence would
[1:33:08] saturate every soul
[1:33:09] faith lord jesus in you for every
[1:33:11] circumstance would destroy all the fiery
[1:33:14] darts of the wicked that he throws at us
[1:33:16] all the enticements and every arrow he
[1:33:18] throws at us
[1:33:19] would be thwarted by the shield of faith
[1:33:22] tonight
[1:33:23] we ask god help us lord to be strong in
[1:33:25] the lord
