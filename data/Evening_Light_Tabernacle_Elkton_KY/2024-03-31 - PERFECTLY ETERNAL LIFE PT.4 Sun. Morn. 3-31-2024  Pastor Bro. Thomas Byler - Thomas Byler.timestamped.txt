[0:01] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[0:04] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[0:07] and salom had brought sweet spices that
[0:11] they might come and anoint
[0:20] him and they said among themselves who
[0:23] shall roll us away the stone that on the
[0:27] door of the Sepulcher
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] and entering into the Seer they saw a
[0:39] young man sitting on the right side
[0:42] clothed in a long white garment and they
[0:45] were AF
[0:57] frighted but go your way tell his
[1:02] disciples and Peter that he goeth before
[1:04] you into Galilee there ye shall see him
[1:08] as he said unto
[1:21] you now when Jesus was risen early the
[1:25] first day of the week he appeared first
[1:27] to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had
[1:31] cast Seven
[1:39] Devils and they when they had heard that
[1:42] he was alive and had been seen of her
[1:45] believed
[1:53] not and they went and told it unto the
[1:56] residue neither believed they them
[2:13] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[2:16] world and preach the gospel to every
[2:26] creature and these signs shall follow
[2:29] them that believe in my name shall they
[2:32] cast out
[2:33] Devils they shall speak with new
[2:44] tongues so then after the Lord had
[2:47] spoken unto them he was received up into
[2:50] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[2:53] this one together and they went forth
[2:56] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[2:59] with them
[3:01] and confirming the word with signs
[3:03] following

[5:12] it's like the precious ointment upon the
[5:14] head that ran down upon the beard even
[5:16] Aaron's beard that went down to the
[5:18] skirts of the of his garments made me

[5:22] the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost is
[5:24] there's power there's power and
[5:25] demonstration of the Holy Ghost man
[5:28] manifesting himself you know it and you

[7:15] my heart's been lately and it should be
[7:17] daily you know as we've been approaching
[7:18] this Resurrection Day it's making me
[7:20] think and I wrote this to the group the
[7:22] other day and it was just kind of kind
[7:23] of ironic I thought that brother Steve
[7:26] uh asked me to do this when everything
[7:29] that's been on my heart you know as
[7:30] we've been approaching this day you know
[7:32] I as I fellowship with people at work
[7:34] and you know you you're around people a
[7:36] lot you know they don't think spiritual
[7:38] a lot like we do you know but so when
[7:40] you can ask people you know you know you
[7:45] know my spot lost my spot you know being
[7:48] around people for just what are we here
[7:51] for you know when you can ask people and
[7:53] think and you just see people you know
[7:54] you ask them ask yourself what are we
[7:56] really here for you know to just come
[7:59] die
[8:00] come live and die what did Jesus come
[8:01] for just to go die on the cross and and
[8:03] pay for our sins you know what's the big
[8:06] purpose of life you know is it to be a
[8:08] good guy raise a family just do the best
[8:11] you can at life and hope it's good
[8:13] enough at the end or is there a greater
[8:15] bigger picture you know so as my
[8:18] thoughts began to I had I was going down
[8:21] the road one day I pulled over and was
[8:22] just writing this in my phone I was just
[8:24] it was just coming to me and it was just
[8:25] so rich and I wanted to share it but you
[8:27] know it's more of a king of glory come
[8:29] down clothed in himself in fleshly body
[8:32] called his son to redeem the Fallen
[8:34] creation and pay with us pay with his
[8:37] life for the sins of the world and do
[8:39] his will paid the most cruelest
[8:42] death why because he allowed the fall to
[8:45] come to bring us back and show his love
[8:47] to redeem us being likened unto us that
[8:50] we now can accept his free love gift by
[8:52] faith in God that now we can repent and
[8:55] get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[8:56] we now are dead and B to ourselves daily
[8:59] that is the Great Big King that we serve
[9:02] that can live through us again in
[9:03] fellowship with us as as he was with
[9:06] Adam or Jesus now we can relive our book
[9:08] of Acts and he said the works that I do
[9:11] you shall do also the the shine s all
[9:13] them that believe Greater Works shall
[9:15] you do because I
[9:16] go to the father see the bigger picture
[9:19] now that God had in his mind before the
[9:21] foundation of the world his family of
[9:23] sons and daughters building himself a
[9:24] word bride bone of his bone flesh of his
[9:26] flesh John 1:1 says in the beginning was
[9:28] the word the word was with God the Word
[9:30] was God see what a privilege we
[9:33] have when we read this word we look at
[9:35] the Bible I was thinking about it one
[9:36] day when I was just sitting there
[9:37] thinking on the Lord looking at the word
[9:39] I'm like you know we look at that word
[9:40] that's the mind of God you know that was
[9:42] his mind them thoughts made
[9:44] manif went
[9:46] to you know is what what a privilege and
[9:50] honor that we are no greater time down
[9:52] through the sands of time that God's
[9:53] brought us a prophet like we have now
[9:55] and the revelation of the hour to live
[9:58] where we are is a more intimate
[9:59] relationship with Jesus Christ the word
[10:02] because it's just like a husband and
[10:03] wife more in an intimate
[10:06] relationship than just a regular old
[10:08] friend is Jesus Christ Living Through us
[10:10] and bringing the manifestation of the
[10:12] revelation of the hour blessed be his
[10:14] name you know now it's now now I got
[10:17] winging on that there so he said I said
[10:19] now look it's it's now that that's we
[10:22] are believers he allows us our
[10:23] relationship to grow more intimate
[10:25] that's more than book more than a book
[10:27] of pages called a b or Jesus on the
[10:30] cross story or a Manger in Bethlehem
[10:33] it's a god with skin on it again huh
[10:35] that it is a god with skin on and
[10:37] showing his attributes displaying
[10:38] himself the word in us like a billboard
[10:40] for Christ like we must display him his
[10:44] word now we have trials and tribulations
[10:46] that mold and shape our character just
[10:48] like he did in Jesus huh God is love and
[10:51] love is corrective he'll allows sickness
[10:53] to come to show his attributes that he's
[10:54] a Healer he had to allow death so that
[10:57] he could mend your wounds and give you
[10:59] hope to see your loved ones again he had
[11:01] to allow you to get Bound by slavery of
[11:03] the devil from religion to drugs to
[11:04] prison to prison in your own body to
[11:06] show you that he came to set the
[11:07] captives free and so that when when you
[11:12] know when he when he set you free it's a
[11:15] peace that passes understanding and joy
[11:16] unspeakable and full of Glory it's
[11:18] godliness with contentments great gain
[11:20] blessed be the name of the Lord you know
[11:22] he said it's the love of God that shed
[11:23] abroad in our hearts God himself made
[11:26] himself a tabernacle of Flesh living and
[11:28] dwelling in our hearts again so let us
[11:30] die and surrender and get out of the way
[11:32] that you may live again through us today
[11:34] you know I love you Lord you going put
[11:37] slide number one
[11:39] up you know this this slide number one
[11:42] here if you see this up here I thought
[11:45] it was pretty cool we'll just let it
[11:47] play is it
[11:51] playing it's just a little timelapse of
[11:54] an almond tree this time lapse shows
[11:56] from March 4th to se September 20th the
[11:59] time lapse of what it takes for almond
[12:02] to bloom when you come into the presence
[12:04] of the king you can do it in a moment a
[12:06] twinkling of a ey what what was it what
[12:09] was iron Rod when it was back there then
[12:10] it bloomed it blossomed bloomed and
[12:12] budded and brought forth almonds all in
[12:15] 24 hours but you come in the presence of
[12:17] the king he can do the same thing you
[12:19] know just I thought that was so awesome
[12:21] when you just look at that I just
[12:22] thought we could just let it play but
[12:24] when you come into the presence of life
[12:27] it Chang look at Lazarus he was dead but
[12:30] he was alive when he spoke you know we
[12:32] already know that he said if he hadn't
[12:34] spoke Lazarus everybody would have came
[12:35] forth blessed be the name of the Lord
[12:37] because when you come in contact with
[12:39] life life changes you you know he said
[12:41] what about the woman after well she was
[12:42] dead in sins and trespasses but when
[12:44] Faith struck that life produced a new
[12:46] life in Christ blessed be the name of
[12:48] the Lord but you just look at that rod
[12:49] in the presence of life that stick
[12:51] brought forth life in the presence of
[12:53] life oh hallelujah what it is to be in
[12:56] the presence of the truth the life and
[12:57] the way Jesus
[13:01] Christ glory to God and then you look
[13:04] here he says and behold the of Aaron the
[13:08] house of Levi was budded and brought
[13:09] forth Buds and blossomed and bloomed and
[13:11] yielded almonds on down it said and the
[13:14] Lord said unto Moses bring Aaron's Rod
[13:16] again uh before the testimony to be kept
[13:20] for the for a token and you slide down
[13:23] the verse chapter 18 and the Lord said
[13:25] unto Aaron thou and thy sons in thy
[13:27] father's house with thee shall bear the
[13:30] iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and
[13:32] thy Sons with thee shall bear the
[13:34] iniquity of the priesthood so it got to
[13:36] really getting me all fired up because I
[13:38] just thought about that branch in the
[13:40] back there in the holies the holies
[13:41] bringing forth life it got me to
[13:43] thinking on that what what was so
[13:45] awesome is when he asked me to do this
[13:46] and we know this is a Resurrection
[13:48] Sunday and in my Bible study I mean my
[13:50] my study Bible here at the bottom it
[13:52] says Aaron's Rod that but it was a type
[13:54] of Christ in the resurrection owned of
[13:57] God the high priest Aaron's priesthood
[13:59] had been questioned in the rebellion of
[14:01] course so God himself will confirm each
[14:03] tribe has a per perfectly uh dead Rod
[14:07] you know it just made me think of a type
[14:09] of all the churches today but in Jesus
[14:11] Christ today the bride liveth you know
[14:15] but it said God put life into erands
[14:17] only see all the authors of religion
[14:19] have died Christ among them but only
[14:22] Christ had raised from the dead and
[14:24] exalted to be the high
[14:26] priest is that still going you can go to
[14:29] slide number two and he said can you
[14:30] than Jesus Jesus said I'm the
[14:32] resurrection and the life he that
[14:34] believes on me though he be dead he
[14:37] shall live again think we are now behind
[14:39] the torn Veil into the holies of holies
[14:42] you see there you you see the holies of
[14:44] holies now the high priest and he says
[14:46] right here he said in Matthew 27 he said
[14:49] and behold the veil of the temple was
[14:51] rent uh twine Twain From the top to the
[14:54] bottom and the Earth did quake and the
[14:56] Rocks was rent and the graves open up
[14:58] and many
[15:30] [Music]
[15:59] get up on out of here with the Lord
[16:00] Jesus when he comes to take us back
[16:02] blessed be the name of the Lord and then
[16:04] you go to the Hebrews here he said for
[16:07] for as then as the children of partakers
[16:09] of the Flesh and
[16:10] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[16:13] of the same and through the death of the
[16:15] of the
[16:17] same though through the death the
[16:21] mighty tongue through there he Mighty
[16:23] destroy him that had the power over
[16:25] death that is the devil and to deliver
[16:27] them who through the fear of death were
[16:30] of a lifetime uh subject to bondage for
[16:33] verily he took on him the not the nature
[16:35] of angels He took of him the Seed of
[16:37] Abraham wherefore in all things it
[16:40] behooved him to be made liken unto his
[16:42] Brethren he might be a merciful and
[16:44] faithful high priest and things
[16:46] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[16:49] for the sins of the people for that in
[16:52] that he himself suffered being tempted
[16:54] he is able to secure them that are
[16:56] tempted blessed be the name of the Lord
[16:58] and the next verse says and wherefore
[17:01] holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[17:02] calling consider the
[17:05] Apostle and high priest of our
[17:08] profession Christ Jesus I just love that
[17:11] we thank you so much Lord for all that
[17:13] you do for us and and I wanted to read
[17:15] here a little bit here so I I was
[17:17] looking in in Leviticus and exodus and
[17:20] when you start going I was really going
[17:22] to do a whole long reading but I don't
[17:24] think I'm going to do all that I was
[17:26] going to read this and make it just feel
[17:28] like man man he is reading and going on
[17:30] but but I'm just going to summarize what
[17:32] I was going to do I was going to read it
[17:33] and read it for verse for verse and make
[17:35] it and really just bringing out of how
[17:38] they had to go do this they had to go do
[17:40] this they had to do this you know
[17:40] everything had to be in specific orders
[17:42] all this all these sacrifices and all
[17:44] this labors that they had to do and all
[17:46] this and when they built it they had to
[17:47] have this this this this this all all
[17:49] that God had had them to do or they had
[17:51] to sacrifice you know what Aon and all
[17:53] them things you know all the things you
[17:54] know it goes on pages and Pages you know
[17:56] I was going to read all that but I was
[17:57] going to read enough to make you me like
[17:59] my goodness he's going to keep on going
[18:00] and going ain't he but you know what I
[18:02] wanted to do that for was I wanted to
[18:04] show the details and the labor and the
[18:05] order that's only a tip of what we can
[18:07] imagine in our day what what it must be
[18:11] like we can only imagine what it must be
[18:14] like if we have to we have it so easy
[18:17] Jesus Paid for us when you think about
[18:19] it you know what we do we come to church
[18:23] we just come to the church read your
[18:25] Bible you know you know hang on what's
[18:27] going on hang on he says and we live our
[18:29] life with Simplicity we can do as you
[18:31] will he said do as you will you know but
[18:33] but if we if we don't find that the
[18:35] hardest part is to die to oursel so he
[18:38] can resurrect in us another Life of
[18:40] Christ and then he turned from a rule
[18:42] book of do this or do that in this order
[18:45] or into a love story bringing the oil
[18:48] and the wine the fresh Revelation and
[18:49] the Holy Ghost in us the hope of glory
[18:51] our Earnest expectation of our
[18:53] inheritance sitting in Heavenly places
[18:56] right now that's the peace of God that
[18:58] passes under understanding that that's
[19:00] something brothers and sisters that's
[19:01] what we're living for now that that that
[19:04] that's what life is about that's God in
[19:06] us again that's us in fellowship with
[19:09] our creator what he saw in his mind
[19:11] before the foundation of the world now
[19:13] we're reliving it again here on Earth
[19:15] when leot seeing uh crying all this and
[19:18] that and all this and that when I'm
[19:19] talking to my buddies and my friends and
[19:21] this and that I'm like you ain't got to
[19:22] look at all that junk on Tik Tok or this
[19:24] and that I ain't got to worry about all
[19:25] that cuzz why we're shut in with God
[19:28] blessed the name of the lord it's so
[19:31] wonderful to be shut in with God because
[19:35] Christ tore the veil of the holies of
[19:37] holies you know they only got to go back
[19:39] in there once a year but Jesus Christ
[19:41] being now made the high priest of our
[19:43] confession tore that Veil we can come to
[19:44] him daily confessing our sins coming to
[19:47] that sacrifice that he done laid his
[19:49] life down for us that we can live again
[19:52] so you just think how simple God made it
[19:55] he made it that if we can just take
[19:57] our
[19:59] how simple God made it and made it for
[20:01] us to die to yourself daily take up your
[20:04] cross and follow me he
[20:07] says he said if you continue in my words
[20:10] you are my disciples indeed I like
[20:13] Ecclesiastes he says fear God and keep
[20:15] my commandments so then then I was just
[20:18] thinking how simple it is when you look
[20:20] at all the order and all the things that
[20:22] they had to do in the Old Testament and
[20:23] then you just stop and think about our
[20:25] life we repent daily we read our Bible
[20:29] the bread of life we we bathe in the
[20:31] washing of the water of the word he
[20:33] cleanses us and he clothes us with his
[20:35] righteousness we come to the we come to
[20:37] the house of God for correction
[20:39] fellowship with one
[20:42] another we take communion eat his body
[20:45] drink his blood and wash each other's
[20:47] feet in humility forsaking not the
[20:49] assembling of ourselves you know that we
[20:51] that he says forsaking not the
[20:55] Sim and and the more the more as you say
[20:58] the approaching and exhort and pray for
[21:00] one another daily it said faith in the
[21:02] word meaning re Revelation equals action
[21:05] it always did when you come into contact
[21:07] with life you're going to go and grow
[21:09] and bring forth fruit and doe season it
[21:11] made me think about I I like when
[21:13] Brother Brad brought out brother
[21:14] brandham he when he said brother
[21:16] brandham saw uh uh the Lord made Adam
[21:19] and he said he made him out of the clay
[21:20] or whatever and he said it looked like
[21:21] his feet look like Roots when he bre
[21:23] breathed the life into him he went
[21:25] straight on into action bless be the
[21:26] name of the Lord you can't help it you
[21:28] know it's just a life lived Walking With
[21:30] Jesus you know in conclusion I had a
[21:32] little thought I thought it was I
[21:35] thought it was just powerful how the
[21:36] Lord just drops the little things down
[21:37] to your mind but yeah I was driving down
[21:39] the road the other day on the way home
[21:41] and it's Buzzard you know how usually i'
[21:43] I've hit buzzards I don't know if y'all
[21:44] have or not cuz they fly last minut but
[21:47] this one I was like I'm driving down
[21:49] through her and most time you know I
[21:50] slow down cuz that stupid buzzer I don't
[21:51] want to hit the windshield you know and
[21:53] and this time I'm like I ain't even
[21:55] slowing down and and you know most time
[21:58] even a buzzer the last minute he'll fly

[1:02:03] this morning and most
[1:02:06] churches a little different one amen
[1:02:08] because of the direction that I want to
[1:02:10] go with the help of the Lord on part
[1:02:12] four of our series Amen on perfectly
[1:02:16] eternal life perfectly eternal life amen
[1:02:20] so amen I do appreciate the Sunday
[1:02:22] School lesson this morning it certainly
[1:02:24] went right along with what we want to
[1:02:25] speak on with the help of the Lord also
[1:02:28] this morning amen it's John 3 and of
[1:02:31] course verse
[1:02:34] 15 let's go to 14 and as Moses lifted up
[1:02:39] the serpent in the wilderness even so
[1:02:41] must the son of man be lifted up that
[1:02:44] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:02:47] perish but have eternal life for God so
[1:02:52] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:02:53] begotten son that who
[1:02:56] whoever believeth
[1:02:58] for God sent not his son into the world
[1:03:01] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:03:04] him might be saved now go to First John
[1:03:08] if you will all the way back to First
[1:03:23] John and chapter 4 1 John chapter
[1:03:34] 4 and we'll begin with let's just I I
[1:03:39] wanted to come back and read some of
[1:03:41] this we might mention it but for now
[1:03:43] we'll just read it all beloved let us
[1:03:45] love one another verse S beloved let us
[1:03:48] love one another for love is of God and
[1:03:50] everyone that loveth is born of God and
[1:03:53] knoweth God he that love loveth not
[1:03:56] knoweth not God for God is love and
[1:04:00] that's the point we want to make there
[1:04:01] is that God is love
[1:04:06] amen amen now notice this will go along
[1:04:10] with John 3:16 in this was manifested
[1:04:13] the love of God towards us because that
[1:04:17] God sent his only begotten son into the
[1:04:19] world that we might live through him
[1:04:23] amen herein is love not that we love God
[1:04:27] but that he loved us and sent his son to
[1:04:30] be the propitiation for our sins and
[1:04:34] beloved if God so loved us we ought also
[1:04:37] to
[1:04:39] love one another
[1:04:42] God dwelleth in us and his
[1:04:46] love is perfected in US amen now in my
[1:04:52] Bible you go back and will
[1:04:56] we read verse
[1:04:58] 16 amen hereby perceive we the love of
[1:05:04] God because he laid down his life for us
[1:05:08] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:05:12] the Brethren amen now let's go to uh
[1:05:16] another one over in
[1:05:23] Ephesians Ephesians 3
[1:05:36] three now I want to read two more
[1:05:38] scriptures and then we'll let you have
[1:05:40] your seats Ephesians
[1:05:43] 3 and verse 8 unto me who am less than
[1:05:49] the least of All Saints is this Grace
[1:05:52] given that I should preach among the
[1:05:54] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[1:05:57] Christ and to make all men see what is
[1:05:59] the Fellowship of the mystery which from
[1:06:02] the beginning of the world had been hid
[1:06:04] in God who created All Things by Jesus
[1:06:07] Christ to the intent that now unto the
[1:06:10] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[1:06:13] places might be known by the church the
[1:06:19] manifold wisdom of God one page back
[1:06:24] Ephesians 1 and verse 9 goes along with
[1:06:27] the scripture that we just
[1:06:29] read one and verse 9 says having made
[1:06:32] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:06:35] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:06:37] hath purposed in himself that in the
[1:06:40] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:06:42] might gather together in one all things
[1:06:44] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:06:46] which are on earth even in him in whom
[1:06:50] also we have obtained an inheritance be
[1:06:52] being predestinated according to the
[1:06:55] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:06:58] after the counil of his own will that we
[1:07:00] should be to the praise of his glory who
[1:07:03] first trusted in God Amen may God add
[1:07:06] His blessings to the reading of the word
[1:07:08] you can be seated this
[1:07:10] morning amen praise the Lord so this is
[1:07:14] I really want to get to my subject amen
[1:07:17] that I've tried to get to the last three
[1:07:19] service and we want to try to get right
[1:07:21] down to amen and amen talking about what
[1:07:24] we really wanted to to speak of and
[1:07:27] where we was going but there was so much
[1:07:28] of that other that I really thought was
[1:07:31] good amen and I hate to miss anything
[1:07:33] and so amen I just love when the Lord
[1:07:36] just amen begins to amen pour out his
[1:07:39] goodness to us amen I truly believe that
[1:07:42] there is a fountain that God has that's
[1:07:45] open amen amen and any preacher that
[1:07:48] desires it any person that desires more
[1:07:51] of the knowledge and more of God I
[1:07:53] believe there is a SP so to speak amen
[1:07:56] that you can turn open amen and you can
[1:07:58] get more of God if you really want more
[1:08:02] of God I was them but there
[1:08:07] was a Hollywood black Hollywood fellow
[1:08:10] I'm not sure if it was 50 cents it
[1:08:12] wasn't 50 Cent but one of them guys amen
[1:08:14] that was talking about Trump and how
[1:08:16] that he believes Trump's going to be in
[1:08:19] again he says but it doesn't really
[1:08:21] matter anyway because we're almost at
[1:08:23] the end anyway
[1:08:26] it's all all the whole world is
[1:08:28] about finished
[1:08:31] anyway imagine that coming from a
[1:08:33] Hollywood star they even it really
[1:08:35] doesn't matter who going in we're so
[1:08:37] close to the end and they know that it's
[1:08:39] so close to the end and it right and I
[1:08:41] believe it was Poland's uh leader over
[1:08:43] there Poland uh uh warned the Europe
[1:08:45] European countries he says you better be
[1:08:47] ready because war is
[1:08:50] coming amen that's what some of the
[1:08:52] leaders are saying amen and would begin
[1:08:54] to think about how late an hour it is
[1:08:56] and how that brother bandam amen being
[1:08:58] gone since 1965 believeing having been
[1:09:01] over with by 1977 close to 50 years past
[1:09:06] what he
[1:09:07] expected it to go talking about the car
[1:09:10] will go all the way to theor amen I it
[1:09:13] just almost shakes you much it kind of
[1:09:16] has to be a wakeup call for all of us to
[1:09:18] realize that it could happen any time
[1:09:20] the Rapture could happen any time and
[1:09:22] I'm very curious of how many is going to
[1:09:25] be left here for the tribulation period
[1:09:27] how many of us message preachers how
[1:09:29] many message churches are going to be
[1:09:31] left here in the tribulation
[1:09:35] period hello so it is a late hour amen
[1:09:39] and just coming from where it came from
[1:09:41] I was like even they recognize that he
[1:09:43] me we're at the end look at our
[1:09:44] president wanting to spend what eight
[1:09:46] more trillion or something like
[1:09:50] that no care about the debt and all of
[1:09:52] that just man made Easter amen a
[1:09:55] national day for the trans uh
[1:09:59] transgender uh what did v j transgender
[1:10:03] day of visibility is what our president
[1:10:05] made our Easter out of it with a great
[1:10:09] big bunny rabbit ain't that right how
[1:10:11] many know Easter isn't about big bunny
[1:10:13] rabbits and it sure ain't about
[1:10:15] transgender but what is it amen just
[1:10:18] mocking God is that right but how many
[1:10:20] knows it has to get that way because the
[1:10:22] pro of God see Place burnt to a chis how
[1:10:26] many know that's the future of America
[1:10:29] amen is to be completely burned
[1:10:32] over amen so I say I believe it's a
[1:10:35] wakeup call I believe that we ought to
[1:10:36] shake ourselves and say where am I at
[1:10:39] with Christ amen I got a little
[1:10:42] something that came to me this week and
[1:10:43] you know sometimes young people you
[1:10:44] might say well if I'm in a message and
[1:10:46] if I'm in a Christian amen what is it
[1:10:49] that I should do and can do and what
[1:10:51] can't I do amen but you know I thought
[1:10:53] about this I thought that's not really
[1:10:55] the appropriate question the real right
[1:10:57] question is what do you want to
[1:11:01] do amen how believe is a real Christian
[1:11:04] it's about whether you desire the right
[1:11:06] things or the wrong things if you claim
[1:11:08] to be a Christian you're still Desiring
[1:11:10] the wrong thing you still got the love
[1:11:12] of the world in your heart and the love
[1:11:14] of God is not in
[1:11:18] there amen this morning with the help of
[1:11:21] the lord we want to talk about another
[1:11:23] aspect another essence of God because we
[1:11:25] know the believer amen according to and
[1:11:28] I'll just go it right quick if I can and
[1:11:30] we'll just read it again wasn't going to
[1:11:32] he says but first
[1:11:34] Peter says that ver chapter 1 verse4
[1:11:37] whereby given unto us exceeding great
[1:11:39] and precious promises but that by these
[1:11:41] you might be partakers of the divine
[1:11:43] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:11:46] that is in the world through lust amen
[1:11:48] and then of course it goes on all of
[1:11:49] those aspects of what God is so we're on
[1:11:52] how many believes that as a Christian we
[1:11:54] take on a div divine nature the very
[1:11:59] life of God is to be in you and me amen
[1:12:03] if there's two things that are Prophet
[1:12:05] Us in the token message amen a perfect
[1:12:07] love message he says lay aside
[1:12:09] everything all of your religious
[1:12:10] demonstrations and all these other stuff
[1:12:12] am me aren't going to count to anything
[1:12:14] only the literal life of Jesus Christ is
[1:12:17] going to be going into Rapture so if you
[1:12:20] ain't living Christ's life out to you
[1:12:22] this morning forget everything else
[1:12:25] until you get nothing but that Holy
[1:12:27] Ghost life in
[1:12:32] you nothing El is
[1:12:35] going says it'll take perfect love to
[1:12:38] put you there so if you ain't got the
[1:12:39] perfect love of God in your heart don't
[1:12:41] worry about everything else make sure
[1:12:43] you get the perfect love of God in your
[1:12:44] heart we want to talk about the love of
[1:12:46] God with the help of the Lord this
[1:12:48] morning for a little while amen first
[1:12:50] thing we realize is that the very
[1:12:52] essence the very being of God God Amen
[1:12:57] according to John's this here he says
[1:12:59] for he that loveth
[1:13:01] no he that loveth not knowth not God
[1:13:04] because go for God is
[1:13:13] love amen I was wondering if I could get
[1:13:16] permission to go as long as we want this
[1:13:19] morning this is Easter amen I'm glad to
[1:13:23] see everybody this morning because I
[1:13:24] want to say something you know but B
[1:13:26] says you know sometimes people you wish
[1:13:28] him mer uh Happy Easter or whatever at
[1:13:31] Christmas because you won't see them
[1:13:32] till Easter again amen so we're glad to
[1:13:35] see everybody at least we showed up on
[1:13:37] Easter
[1:13:38] amen you know there something else about
[1:13:42] Easter you know about the Jesus Christ
[1:13:45] but you know we do that every
[1:13:51] week how many know we honor the
[1:13:53] resurrection because rose on the first
[1:13:56] day of the week on Monday what we call
[1:13:58] Monday but
[1:13:59] Sunday oh boy here we go am me Sunday
[1:14:02] used to be
[1:14:07] Monday well figuratively speaking you
[1:14:10] know Monday is the beginning of our week
[1:14:13] right but Sunday used to be the
[1:14:15] beginning of the week is that right
[1:14:17] because Saturday is the Sabbath day
[1:14:20] Saturday is the Sabbath then Sunday used
[1:14:22] to be the first of the week so it it's
[1:14:23] been that's why I said it that way way
[1:14:25] amen but because that he rose on this
[1:14:28] day we come to
[1:14:30] church but B says we come to church and
[1:14:33] amen we honor that Resurrection because
[1:14:35] that's the day he was Rose so Glory but
[1:14:38] how many know we don't just oh my Paul
[1:14:40] said you know sometimes we celebrate
[1:14:42] Easter we celebrate Christmas we
[1:14:44] celebrate this that or the other you
[1:14:46] know but how many knows that we're
[1:14:47] really not about all that because we're
[1:14:50] Eternal
[1:14:51] beings amen and we don't even have to
[1:14:54] worry about that anymore because we're
[1:14:56] in Christ now and all those things are
[1:14:58] fulfilled in
[1:15:00] Christ amen the amen he's given us a
[1:15:03] perfect rest how many glad to have a
[1:15:05] perfect rest what is the rest of God let
[1:15:08] me tell you what the rest of God is the
[1:15:09] rest of God means that who has ceased
[1:15:13] from his own works now you get to rest
[1:15:16] in God cease from your own Works God
[1:15:19] help us and me let that get down in our
[1:15:22] hearts we have ceased from our own work
[1:15:28] then you can have a
[1:15:29] Sabbath
[1:15:33] amen praise the
[1:15:35] Lord I'm going to just uh take off and
[1:15:38] I'm goingon to read the quotes that I've
[1:15:39] wanted to read for about three weeks
[1:15:41] we're going to read the quote and start
[1:15:42] from there so the very essence God is
[1:15:45] the very essence of God is love we know
[1:15:50] that love is the
[1:15:53] glue I'm not not sure I'm thinking maybe
[1:15:56] it was the Statue of a perfect man when
[1:15:59] brother Brandon preached that he says
[1:16:01] you know that whenever love comes down
[1:16:04] you have all these other things but when
[1:16:05] that perfect love it kind of cements it
[1:16:07] all together isn't that the way you put
[1:16:09] it am mean it's almost like a glue that
[1:16:11] it just glues it all together why
[1:16:14] because glue keeps families
[1:16:18] together love all right the love of God
[1:16:21] Is Like Glue that keeps a relationship
[1:16:24] together it brings the world together it
[1:16:27] formed the world it did all of these
[1:16:29] things hate on the other side on the
[1:16:31] other hand
[1:16:32] destroys I mean know hate is the
[1:16:34] opposite of love it destroys and it
[1:16:37] divides and so forth
[1:16:39] amen so we're thankful that God is love
[1:16:43] we want to talk about his love here for
[1:16:45] with the help of the Lord if we can amen
[1:16:48] listen to this and perfect love amen is
[1:16:52] uh or or God's love now notice how that
[1:16:54] God
[1:16:55] loved us from the very from the very
[1:16:58] beginning he loved us and
[1:17:01] everything that he did was because of
[1:17:06] Love is that
[1:17:08] right everything he did was because he
[1:17:12] loved that's why we read that
[1:17:15] amen about for God so loved the world he
[1:17:19] didn't come to condemn the world but he
[1:17:21] came that the world might have eternal
[1:17:24] life that whosoever whoever believeth on
[1:17:25] him amen and that love is a love that
[1:17:30] shares is that
[1:17:32] right it was it says it says there that
[1:17:36] it's not that we have loved God first
[1:17:38] but God first loved us and now we love
[1:17:41] him ain't that right first God loved us
[1:17:44] and now we get to reciprocate and have
[1:17:47] that same love back for almighty God
[1:17:50] Amen a few days brother says a few days
[1:17:53] ago I was sitting talking to my loyal
[1:17:55] little friend here in the city a medical
[1:17:57] doctor Sam Adair and he says how are you
[1:18:00] doing bill and I said oh pretty fair I
[1:18:03] suppose Doc and I said yourself and he
[1:18:06] said oh I had a lot of patience and said
[1:18:08] we had about
[1:18:10] 15 examinations this afternoon I said
[1:18:13] well that's good as long as it's just
[1:18:14] examinations and finding nothing wrong I
[1:18:17] says you know we got to talk about back
[1:18:18] when we were boys and I says well doc I
[1:18:20] know I don't know just how long I've
[1:18:23] been going to going to be around we're
[1:18:25] both in our 50s and he said that's true
[1:18:27] bill and I said but all of these years
[1:18:30] about 31 years of ministry now I have
[1:18:33] kept my heart prepared for that hour
[1:18:35] when he comes how many believe that's
[1:18:38] important it's important that you keep
[1:18:41] their heart ready for that hour when he
[1:18:44] does
[1:18:46] show let me just say this again this is
[1:18:49] the hour folks this is the time this is
[1:18:52] that last watch is that right Jesus said
[1:18:55] if you if you watch you would have not

[1:19:34] the greatest
[1:19:37] thrill the greatest thrill that I have
[1:19:41] brother bam says the greatest thrill of
[1:19:44] brother Bam's life and what he had was
[1:19:47] is living for
[1:19:51] others living for others amen
[1:19:55] he said that's what makes life real is
[1:19:57] when you not what you could do or
[1:19:59] accomplish for yourself but what you can
[1:20:02] do for
[1:20:04] others amen amen listen to this see
[1:20:08] that's what's that's when you're really
[1:20:16] living never did that try to LIF
[1:20:20] somebody
[1:20:21] else give that a try and just see how
[1:20:25] much more life holds for you when you
[1:20:28] will not live for what you can get
[1:20:31] yourself out of
[1:20:32] life but what you can give somebody else
[1:20:36] in
[1:20:37] life and you'll find that it's more
[1:20:40] bless Riches of anything that can be
[1:20:42] thought
[1:20:43] of Amen does the bible teach us that it
[1:20:46] is more blessed to give than it is to
[1:20:51] receive the giving of ourself now about
[1:20:54] even the Bible says you know he said
[1:20:56] that we are supposed to present our
[1:20:58] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:21:03] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:21:05] reasonable servant your very life is
[1:21:08] supposed to be a life of sacrifice to
[1:21:13] God
[1:21:19] Amen my it's more
[1:21:22] blessed all the riches of anything can
[1:21:25] be thought of is what you can do for
[1:21:27] somebody else to make life's burden
[1:21:30] which life itself is a
[1:21:34] burden amen anybody ever try to get out
[1:21:37] of it oh I'm just G to get out of I'm
[1:21:39] gonna have life easy no you still got to
[1:21:41] get up and make your coffee and get
[1:21:42] dressed and shower and take care of your
[1:21:44] problems of the
[1:21:47] day life is a
[1:21:51] burden listen it is a burden and it will
[1:21:54] make make a little lighter for somebody
[1:21:55] else you just don't know the joy unless
[1:21:58] you've tried it once amen and this is
[1:22:02] the nessage um the bru serpent when
[1:22:05] brother bam goes on to saying talking
[1:22:07] about having been on the ministry for 31
[1:22:09] years and he was stepping down from that
[1:22:10] Ministry at this hour and during that
[1:22:13] time that he preached that he I'm
[1:22:15] stepping down because people have made
[1:22:17] me Jesus
[1:22:19] Christ they want to say that I'm Jesus
[1:22:22] Christ and that would make me an
[1:22:23] antichrist and I'm stepping down because
[1:22:25] of it getting out of the ministry y'all
[1:22:29] remember that amen and of course those
[1:22:31] Brothers repented and so forth and
[1:22:33] brother brandham get back on this got
[1:22:35] back on uh the ministry and so forth and
[1:22:37] he seen that serpent that was bruised
[1:22:39] isn't that right it didn't quite die
[1:22:41] even Joseph today able admit it that
[1:22:43] that isn't quite bad yet people want to
[1:22:46] make Joseph Jesus it's a spirit it's an
[1:22:49] antichrist spirit amen but anyway and
[1:22:52] listen to what he says before we go on
[1:22:55] now notice he says now notice he says
[1:22:58] and that brings me to thinking of 31
[1:23:00] years will
[1:23:02] soon be of Ministry for the Lord and I
[1:23:04] guess every man thinks of sometime when
[1:23:07] he has to come to his last last service
[1:23:10] or come to his last hour and look back
[1:23:12] down the path and see what has been
[1:23:14] accomplished see what's went on have you
[1:23:16] did
[1:23:19] anything is that right is that a good
[1:23:21] question it's going to be a good
[1:23:23] question when you go to come down to
[1:23:25] your
[1:23:26] deathbed folks I'm here to tell you
[1:23:28] you're not going to think about what you
[1:23:29] made or how much you gained in this
[1:23:31] world it isn't going to mean nothing the
[1:23:34] only thing that's going to come to your
[1:23:36] mind for what service did I do for the
[1:23:39] Lord how did I serve the Lord
[1:23:47] amen amen can I go
[1:23:51] slow
[1:23:53] amen what did we do when we look back
[1:23:56] down what did we do for the Lord what
[1:24:00] kind of a life is a Christian life isn't
[1:24:04] that a good
[1:24:05] question amen let's see
[1:24:07] here I'm going to go to Mark 9 Mark
[1:24:15] 9 let's think about this what have you
[1:24:18] done have you did anything
[1:24:21] amen the disciples you know
[1:24:25] they had arguments with themselves about
[1:24:28] who's going to be the greatest isn't
[1:24:29] that right what did they accomplish how
[1:24:32] great are they going to
[1:24:36] become a that right and in chapter nine
[1:24:40] of St Mark I believe it is chapter 9 and
[1:24:42] verse 34 and he came to cernium and
[1:24:46] being in the house he asked them isn't
[1:24:49] that something now they had to from what
[1:24:52] I understand they had this conversation
[1:24:54] amongst themselves but Jesus knew what
[1:24:57] was going in their mind so he brings
[1:24:59] this up is that right he brings this up
[1:25:03] and asked them what is it that he
[1:25:05] disputed amongst yourselves by the way
[1:25:09] but they held their
[1:25:11] peace for by the way they had disputed
[1:25:14] amongst themselves who should be the
[1:25:17] greatest and he sat down and he called
[1:25:19] the 12 around him and said unto them if
[1:25:22] any man desire to be the first the same
[1:25:27] shall be last of all and servant of
[1:25:35] all
[1:25:37] see folks I wonder sometimes if people
[1:25:39] aren't just trying to be number one the
[1:25:41] greatest the greatest you want to be the
[1:25:43] greatest greatest greatest how many
[1:25:45] knows God the greatest of all became
[1:25:48] servant of all so much servant until he
[1:25:50] took a tub of water and washed Peter's
[1:25:53] feet Peter
[1:25:54] no no we have we've got a footwash
[1:25:57] flunky can wash our feet you're not the
[1:26:00] footwash flunky huh but Jesus rebuked
[1:26:03] him no and what did Jesus says what I do
[1:26:06] thou knowest not now but I'm giving you
[1:26:08] an example that you should do as I have
[1:26:11] done to
[1:26:12] you how many believe that God Jesus
[1:26:15] Christ was the example of perfect
[1:26:20] love amen and of this is and the world
[1:26:23] that we're living in with which is what
[1:26:24] I want to go back and pick up
[1:26:27] amen it's about not being the greatest
[1:26:30] but to be servant of
[1:26:34] everybody even him being you call me
[1:26:37] master and Lord and you say well for so
[1:26:39] I am if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:26:43] wash your feet you also ought to wash
[1:26:47] one another's feet for I've given you an
[1:26:49] example you should do as I have done
[1:26:52] unto you
[1:26:55] amen and so as you notice how Jesus
[1:26:58] Christ sets the mind frame hey don't
[1:27:01] worry about being the greatest be the
[1:27:04] smallest be the servant of
[1:27:09] everybody
[1:27:11] that what's going
[1:27:13] to amen Matthew
[1:27:17] 10 Matthew
[1:27:20] 10 he puts it another
[1:27:23] way 10 and
[1:27:27] 25 Jesus
[1:27:29] said the disciple is not above his
[1:27:34] master he says nor the servant above his
[1:27:38] Lord it is enough for the disciple that
[1:27:41] he be as his master and the servant as
[1:27:44] his Lord if they have caught me the
[1:27:47] Master of the House be elub how much
[1:27:49] more shall they call them of his
[1:27:52] household amen fear them not therefore
[1:27:56] for there is nothing covered that shall
[1:27:57] not be revealed and hid that shall not
[1:27:59] be known so if you'll notice there he
[1:28:01] says that you know it is enough that the
[1:28:04] disciple be as if they called him be El
[1:28:08] how many know the God of all creation
[1:28:11] took the lowest name that could be
[1:28:14] called which was the chief of devils the
[1:28:18] elub your
[1:28:21] beab he took the last name so when
[1:28:24] you're persecuted when you're called
[1:28:26] this when you called that don't don't
[1:28:28] despise that know that they called him
[1:28:31] the chief of
[1:28:36] devils and what did God do not only did
[1:28:39] he take him and call him the lowest name
[1:28:41] but he G he took the low job he became
[1:28:45] servant to his
[1:28:47] disciples what was that that was the
[1:28:49] very love of God living for others
[1:28:51] living for
[1:28:53] others
[1:28:55] amen now I want to start my little
[1:28:59] journey
[1:29:01] again
[1:29:02] amen take a little
[1:29:05] trip way back again before the
[1:29:09] foundation of the
[1:29:11] world when he was
[1:29:13] alone Amen Let me see how I wrote it
[1:29:16] down
[1:29:19] here well before I do that I wna
[1:29:24] re more quote is that okay Jesus he was
[1:29:28] just one man the perfect man and he gave
[1:29:31] his life and he made an example for you
[1:29:35] now what must we do now the first thing
[1:29:38] I want to say is Jesus never lived for
[1:29:44] himself his life was spent for others
[1:29:48] that's perfectly eternal
[1:29:53] life
[1:29:55] wo Glory how many do it if you really
[1:29:58] want perfectly eternal life then that is
[1:30:02] a life that is about living for others
[1:30:07] not what you can get for yourself that
[1:30:10] doesn't count one B you get no brownie
[1:30:12] point you get no marks for anything that
[1:30:15] you accomplish for yourself but what you
[1:30:17] do for others give and it shall be given
[1:30:20] unto you press down good measure and
[1:30:23] running over it's more bless blessed to
[1:30:25] give than it is to
[1:30:28] receive but we have it wrong don't we we
[1:30:30] like when we get
[1:30:33] stuff but it's better when you get one
[1:30:36] giving
[1:30:40] stuff
[1:30:42] amen praise the
[1:30:45] Lord that's perfectly eternal life when
[1:30:49] you say brother Tommy had this up I
[1:30:52] think last week when you say that you go
[1:30:54] to church and you do good things that's
[1:30:57] fine but when you live your life to
[1:31:01] yourself you haven't eternal
[1:31:08] life huh should we have an altar call
[1:31:11] right about now how much of your spent
[1:31:15] time do you spend living for
[1:31:19] yourself huh a't that right don't we do
[1:31:22] it y'all are just keep your hands down
[1:31:24] this guy up here spends way too much
[1:31:27] time living for
[1:31:28] himself hey my wife doesn't cook quite

[1:31:53] the roast
[1:31:56] said keep me keeping my mouth shut and
[1:31:58] say honey this is some wonderful
[1:32:01] roast
[1:32:04] huh why because we're so much about us
[1:32:08] how many knows that's why marriages are
[1:32:10] in trouble like they are because people
[1:32:12] are thinking about their
[1:32:16] self
[1:32:17] amen thinking about their self you don't
[1:32:22] have eternal life brother B says if
[1:32:24] you're living it just for your own self
[1:32:26] eternal life is living for others it
[1:32:30] proved it when he come into the Lamb of
[1:32:32] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:32:35] because he did not live for himself he
[1:32:36] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:32:39] life by receiving that day on Calvary

[1:45:09] mystery Amen to the intent now that the
[1:45:12] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[1:45:14] places might be known by the church the
[1:45:17] manifold wisdom of God the whole plan of
[1:45:21] God be made
[1:45:25] how many glad to be able to understand
[1:45:28] the secrets of the
[1:45:30] universe the mysteries of the universe
[1:45:34] why is there such suffering why is there
[1:45:36] such pain why is there such Evil all of
[1:45:40] things are
[1:45:46] answered amen we understand them now
[1:45:49] don't
[1:45:51] we way back when I got to thinking about
[1:45:54] this he was all by
[1:45:57] himself way
[1:45:59] back amen he was all by himself his very
[1:46:03] essence is love his very essence was
[1:46:10] love and you just it was all bottled
[1:46:14] up huh all bottled up trying to get
[1:46:21] out I got to Express
[1:46:24] this I want to
[1:46:26] express what's in my heart how many
[1:46:28] knows when you love somebody you express
[1:46:34] it there's no expression there's no
[1:46:37] love but he want to express this number
[1:46:41] one thing the most powerful force in the
[1:46:43] universe what is great is hope faith
[1:46:46] charity Paul said the greatest of Faith
[1:46:48] greatest of Everything Is Lost nothing
[1:46:51] is powerful is lost
[1:46:56] whatever you love you'll do you'll end
[1:46:58] up do you'll find a way to do
[1:47:03] it
[1:47:05] amen bottled up just God by himself all
[1:47:11] alone all by
[1:47:14] himself Millions maybe billions of years
[1:47:18] what we would call in our time billions
[1:47:21] and billions and
[1:47:24] billions and billions see as long as I
[1:47:27] keep saying billions I kind of bring
[1:47:29] some kind of imagination in my heart of
[1:47:32] a time span of
[1:47:34] God ain't that right but it's illogical
[1:47:38] and not true because he never had a
[1:47:42] beginning so it wasn't billions and
[1:47:44] billions he always was and that's more
[1:47:46] than what the human mind can comprehend
[1:47:48] I can't go back that far it's just not
[1:47:50] deep
[1:47:51] enough
[1:47:53] maybe if my head was this
[1:47:55] big I don't
[1:47:58] know but
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:00] think back to all by himself and he had
[1:48:04] to love and he began to think you know I
[1:48:07] don't want to be by
[1:48:09] myself I believe one place brother the B
[1:48:11] said that God was
[1:48:13] lonely is that right God was
[1:48:16] lonely and he wanted
[1:48:21] companionship brother says this way and
[1:48:25] he begin to think here in is set forth
[1:48:29] the love of God he desired in love a
[1:48:33] family of his own how many knows the
[1:48:35] very family unit is a representation of
[1:48:39] what God had in his
[1:48:45] mind amen he wanted to be a father he
[1:48:48] wanted to be a husband he wanted to love
[1:48:52] his children R he wanted to love his
[1:48:56] wife he wanted to get that
[1:48:59] feminist part amen of himself amen and
[1:49:03] make a help meet so to speak a
[1:49:10] companionship we understand the
[1:49:13] manold wisdom of God of what he thought
[1:49:17] of and what expressed
[1:49:20] it and he got to begin to think in his
[1:49:23] mind how do I have it wrote down
[1:49:28] here oh
[1:49:30] my amen I started this page and then I
[1:49:33] started this page said the some same
[1:49:35] thing and forgot I had wrote it over on
[1:49:36] the other one
[1:49:39] amen and he begin to think I will start
[1:49:42] this
[1:49:43] thing the first thing he had to do is
[1:49:45] begin to think about
[1:49:47] [Applause]
[1:49:49] it first thing he did was come up with a
[1:49:57] plan how many know God has a
[1:50:00] plan that's
[1:50:02] right having made known unto us the
[1:50:05] mystery of his will or his plan
[1:50:09] according to the good pleasure which he
[1:50:10] has purposed in
[1:50:13] himself that's right praise the Lord
[1:50:16] begin to think about
[1:50:19] it and he begin to think about Adam he
[1:50:22] began to think about Eve he think about
[1:50:25] a man he thought about a woman how I'm
[1:50:27] going to how I want
[1:50:30] toess how am I ever going to express my
[1:50:33] love to
[1:50:37] them right and I'm going to be
[1:50:41] expressed through
[1:50:43] them and what did he do created
[1:50:47] Adam that
[1:50:49] right Adam and Eve of course we know was
[1:50:51] at one time both together isn't that
[1:50:54] right they were both
[1:50:58] together and he
[1:50:59] says I'm going to create a
[1:51:03] man and it's not going to be good that
[1:51:06] he's
[1:51:09] alone cuz it's not good that I'm
[1:51:14] alone how many know God doesn't want to
[1:51:16] be alone God a going to be alone
[1:51:19] somebody's going to be with
[1:51:21] him
[1:51:24] somebody's going to sit by by his side
[1:51:26] he's going to be on the throne with
[1:51:31] him they do in order to express himself
[1:51:35] Express his
[1:51:37] love but you know I mean this could take
[1:51:40] till 2 three
[1:51:42] o' because how many knows that he did
[1:51:45] not just have God is just not
[1:51:48] God because God means an object of
[1:51:51] worship
[1:51:53] he's not just God but he's also in God
[1:51:57] is to be
[1:51:59] father that right he had so many things
[1:52:02] that he wanted to
[1:52:05] express is that right father husband
[1:52:11] Redeemer savior deliverer mighty
[1:52:16] warrior is that right he want to express
[1:52:19] all of this and he's like what how am I
[1:52:21] going to do this how am I going to
[1:52:23] express all of this because I don't want
[1:52:25] to just express
[1:52:27] love but I'm going to express that love
[1:52:29] through
[1:52:35] Deliverance I'm gonna
[1:52:37] have
[1:52:40] to
[1:52:43] create
[1:52:46] love I'm going to have to create the
[1:52:50] opposite of life
[1:52:53] I'm going to have to create
[1:52:59] adversity is that
[1:53:03] right now I'm gonna try to have to make
[1:53:06] a long story
[1:53:07] short but as he created the angels all
[1:53:11] of the angels He
[1:53:16] created does anybody know what Lucifer's
[1:53:18] name was before it was Lucifer and all
[1:53:21] this
[1:53:24] I'm not sure if he had a different name
[1:53:26] before the fall or Not Here I Am A
[1:53:28] preacher preaching on and I don't
[1:53:31] know Bible says how art thou Fallen oh L
[1:53:36] of the
[1:53:37] morning that
[1:53:42] right say what
[1:53:45] now yeah okay makes sense how art thou
[1:53:48] Fallen oh Lucifer son of the morning
[1:53:52] amen because you were
[1:53:55] there what did God do he put all he put
[1:54:01] him and he put the angels on freeall
[1:54:05] agency he says I'm going to have to
[1:54:07] create a channel that's fair but put men
[1:54:10] and even Adam and Eve on freeall
[1:54:13] agency ain't that
[1:54:15] right he's going to know he knew what
[1:54:17] was going to happen the devil is not
[1:54:20] stupid and neither is God stupid
[1:54:23] stupid amen like some people think is he
[1:54:26] knew what would
[1:54:28] happen he knew what had happened he know
[1:54:30] how it would
[1:54:35] go of course Angels the devil took
[1:54:38] Lucifer took a third of the angels with
[1:54:40] him is that right preached his message
[1:54:42] of you know God gets all the
[1:54:44] glory we don't get enough
[1:54:47] Glory we want some
[1:54:51] Glory woo you got to watch that you got
[1:54:55] to watch that wanting Glory preachers
[1:54:58] got to watch that wanting Glory churches
[1:55:01] got to watch that want Glory Dayan cor
[1:55:05] wanted some Glory Moses you take too
[1:55:08] much we're spiritual too watch out that
[1:55:11] same Spirit want in
[1:55:13] glory amen God recognized what that was
[1:55:17] that right God says I recognize what's
[1:55:20] on that in that guy let me open up the
[1:55:22] Earth I kicked him out of heaven I'm
[1:55:24] going to kick him off the Earth and I'm
[1:55:25] put him in in hell right off straight
[1:55:28] straight to the gates of hell hello but
[1:55:34] anyway he says look we realize what
[1:55:37] happened through all of that how did the
[1:55:39] fall happen Ain that
[1:55:43] right because he could have never
[1:55:45] expressed it
[1:55:49] right and sometimes we think
[1:55:55] is
[1:55:55] a horrible place with death
[1:56:00] everywhere we ask in our mind how could
[1:56:04] God even allow some of those things like
[1:56:07] down through the Dark Ages the way that
[1:56:09] people were killed his own children were
[1:56:12] slaughtered and killed the way that they
[1:56:14] were huh it's hard for us in our finite
[1:56:19] mind to comprehend it can I say
[1:56:22] something something but you have to have
[1:56:24] a spiritual mind to really be able to
[1:56:27] comprehend it and to get it to get it
[1:56:30] all because I don't
[1:56:33] know about you but I don't like funeral
[1:56:35] homes I don't like hospital I don't like
[1:56:39] people suffering I hate to see those
[1:56:41] animals out there killing each other
[1:56:44] brutally sometimes teating on the back
[1:56:46] end while the front end's still alive
[1:56:48] trying to strugle away
[1:56:51] horrible and
[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:56:54] but God says I'll allow death I'm going
[1:56:56] to allow it how many know this is all
[1:56:58] Allowed by almighty God for what purpose
[1:57:01] and that is to express his love to you
[1:57:03] and
[1:57:06] I listen he had to allow us to
[1:57:11] fall because he could never express
[1:57:13] being a savior unless we
[1:57:17] fa oh here we go and it isn't all about
[1:57:20] the fall it isn't about
[1:57:23] the bad time it's about wisdom for for
[1:57:26] you to say lost he don't intend for you
[1:57:28] to say dead or to die he intends for you
[1:57:31] to believe and Paul said for I reckon
[1:57:34] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:57:36] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:57:38] glory that's to be revealed you could
[1:57:41] suffer for a lifetime you could be
[1:57:43] murdered in every fashion of effect
[1:57:45] it'll never compare with the
[1:57:48] glory of eternal life and the glory of
[1:57:51] Heaven
[1:57:57] does that make sense brother
[1:58:00] Glenn it
[1:58:02] does when you
[1:58:04] look at it the way you're supposed
[1:58:13] to Paul he suffered didn't he beaten
[1:58:17] with rods left for dead
[1:58:21] stone
[1:58:27] [Music]
[1:58:31] amen left Humanity to come the wrong way
[1:58:35] so that you got to be born again is that
[1:58:39] right listen he allowed to
[1:58:44] fall he allowed people to be
[1:58:47] empty allows you sometimes to feel like
[1:58:51] you're empty
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:55] so he could fill you
[1:58:56] up the intent is not for you to fall and
[1:59:00] stay down that isn't God's intent God's
[1:59:05] intent is to pick you up cuz the Angels
[1:59:08] don't know what it's like to be lost
[1:59:10] they don't know what it's like to need a
[1:59:12] savior but oh how we can say Oh What A
[1:59:16] Savior Oh What A Savior is
[1:59:19] M God knew what it would cost him I mean
[1:59:23] if God knew the cost was there thinking
[1:59:25] about he says I'm I'm going to I'm going
[1:59:27] to make a law in the old test that he
[1:59:29] got to be amen if there's any Redemption
[1:59:31] if there's any coming back he got to be
[1:59:33] a Kinsman that does it made all those
[1:59:36] laws and there was one Kinsman that was
[1:59:38] closer to Naomi and Naomi than what the
[1:59:42] Boaz was there was a Kinsman closer and
[1:59:45] he had to decide whether he wanted to do
[1:59:47] the Kinsman work and he couldn't do it
[1:59:50] because he would Mar himself a rep
[1:59:53] representative of the devil the Devil
[1:59:55] Couldn't represent he could not redeem
[1:59:57] us so God took the job of redeeming us
[1:59:59] he knew what it was like to go to
[2:00:00] Calvary you know what it was like to be
[2:00:02] a human being and me not one to die and
[2:00:05] mean you know what it was like to suffer
[2:00:07] you know what it was like to have fa he
[2:00:08] knew what it would like to be
[2:00:11] rejected and his and rejected a man he
[2:00:15] knew that he was going to have to pay
[2:00:16] the ultimate price that he was going to
[2:00:18] have to
[2:00:20] die that's why I said way when he come
[2:00:22] back up again I am he which which was
[2:00:25] dead but I am alive forever more the
[2:00:28] intent wasn't just to die but it was to
[2:00:31] rise again to raise you up on Easter
[2:00:34] morning how many believes that we are
[2:00:36] already resurrected spiritually we're
[2:00:39] not dead anymore in sins and trespasses
[2:00:41] we're resurrected because that is
[2:00:43] expressing his
[2:00:47] [Music]
[2:00:49] love you don't know how happy you ought
[2:00:51] to be you don't know how happy you ought
[2:00:53] to be you don't know how happy you ought
[2:00:56] to be I don't know how happy I ought to
[2:01:01] be so let me tell you while the prophet
[2:01:05] said you ought to be the happiest people
[2:01:07] on the face of the
[2:01:10] Earth
[2:01:12] amen I if we ought to be the happiest
[2:01:14] people that there is this Easter
[2:01:20] morning all right want me to quit
[2:01:23] screaming holler I can calm
[2:01:26] down but this is worth
[2:01:28] shout about this is worth screaming
[2:01:35] [Laughter]
[2:01:39] about he was going to let us be sad so
[2:01:42] that we have joy unspeakable so we have
[2:01:46] the lober of the redeemed devil you
[2:01:49] don't have any more power over me you're
[2:01:51] nothing but a bluff
[2:01:54] devil yeah God heard our scream he heard
[2:01:57] our
[2:02:01] sh he heard our Victory
[2:02:06] cry and he was going to express it his
[2:02:10] love how does he Express his love God is
[2:02:12] so full of love you know how much love
[2:02:16] he has that he died on Calvary for God
[2:02:19] so love the world that he gave everybody
[2:02:22] he gave Kain a pass he gave every Center
[2:02:24] a pass he gave serpen SE a pass and said
[2:02:27] everybody that wants to come and you'll
[2:02:30] have life he pardoned everybody oh I
[2:02:34] wish the whole world could hear me he
[2:02:36] pardoned
[2:02:38] everybody but you got to accept that
[2:02:42] pardon what a loving
[2:02:45] God he didn't say just this one or just
[2:02:48] that one he said
[2:02:50] whosoever
[2:02:52] will who's it for anybody that wants
[2:02:59] to this tape may be played on the day of
[2:03:02] judgment people hear it out there God
[2:03:04] said anybody that wants to can be
[2:03:08] saved and the people listening their
[2:03:11] attitude towards what the God's word
[2:03:13] says will be played
[2:03:16] back
[2:03:17] huh he won't have to judge he'll say
[2:03:20] let's just hit the tape recorder
[2:03:22] this is what the preachers preach this

[2:03:51] about

[2:03:57] and were the Skies of paper made
[2:04:00] parchment made where every stock on
[2:04:02] earth a quill and every man A Tribe by
[2:04:04] trade to write the love of God above
[2:04:07] what drain the ocean dry nor could the
[2:04:09] scroll contain the hole so stretched
[2:04:12] from Sky to Sky what wondrous love is

[2:04:34] soul how many loves that worship him
[2:04:37] what wondrous love that God should love
[2:04:41] a sinner such as I
[2:04:45] amen should yearn to turn my sorrow into
[2:04:50] Simon such love such wondrous love such
[2:04:55] love such wondrous love that God should
[2:04:59] love a sinner such as I how wonderful is
[2:05:03] love life thank you

[2:05:30] this amen for you and for me he spent
[2:05:32] his life for you he spent his life for
[2:05:36] me did it all for his church and his
[2:05:40] people that's for me he made it for me
[2:05:43] he made it for you to express himself
[2:05:47] come all the stars every Star out there
[2:05:49] so we can see it the moon the star STS
[2:05:52] the sun
[2:05:54] everything he didn't live for himself he
[2:05:57] didn't keep it all to
[2:06:00] himself I don't always understand why
[2:06:02] brother why the Bible says God won't
[2:06:04] share his glory with
[2:06:07] any amen his
[2:06:10] honor and his respect but he truly does
[2:06:15] share
[2:06:17] himself with us how many he's glad for
[2:06:20] that he shares
[2:06:22] himself his very being he shares with
[2:06:27] you he shares with
[2:06:32] me that's what Easter means to
[2:06:36] me how did he express it I read you a
[2:06:39] couple of times he says he expressed
[2:06:42] this is how we identify this is how we
[2:06:44] see his love to us that while we were
[2:06:47] yet sinners he died he came and paid for
[2:06:51] our sin sins that's how we know that he
[2:06:54] truly did love us he does love us how
[2:06:57] many believe he loved you absolutely he
[2:07:00] gave his life for you paid for your sins
[2:07:04] wrote a
[2:07:07] pardon don't have to crawl on your knees
[2:07:09] two miles don't have to do no beads and
[2:07:12] Roses don't have to do no Rosary don't
[2:07:14] do all you have to do is accept it say
[2:07:16] Lord Jesus I accept it remember but says
[2:07:20] you can come to the altar and pray and
[2:07:21] pray and pray and pray and pray and pray
[2:07:23] and pray but until you accept it it
[2:07:24] won't
[2:07:25] do you any bit I believe it I believe
[2:07:28] what you did for me on Calvary that was
[2:07:30] for me he expressed it by
[2:07:34] dying to
[2:07:40] himself all right we're in the third
[2:07:48] quarter third that gives us two more
[2:07:51] quarters that's not too good is it this
[2:07:53] all right can I go a little
[2:07:57] longer got a couple okays
[2:08:02] there now I wanted to get to something
[2:08:05] that I told you I wanted to get to for
[2:08:07] some time
[2:08:12] already
[2:08:14] Ephesians you want to go with me
[2:08:20] Ephesians
[2:08:26] it sounds like a
[2:08:28] marital scripture between a husband and
[2:08:31] wife but Paul said that is he spoke this
[2:08:34] is a mystery great mystery but I speak
[2:08:37] concerning Christ and the church in
[2:08:40] chapter 5 of Ephesians in verse
[2:08:44] 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own
[2:08:48] husbands as unto the Lord
[2:08:51] and he is the savior of the
[2:08:54] body amen therefore as the church is
[2:08:57] subject to Christ so let the wives be to
[2:08:59] their own husbands and
[2:09:02] everything husbands I like this husbands
[2:09:06] love your wives even as Christ also
[2:09:11] loved the church and gave himself for
[2:09:18] it how many knows that a husband and a
[2:09:21] wife they
[2:09:22] Express the very sacrifice of Jesus
[2:09:25] Christ
[2:09:26] amen folks I'm here to tell you when a
[2:09:29] man marries a woman he isn't just to go
[2:09:31] free and do his own thing and have his
[2:09:33] own thing this that the other that wife
[2:09:35] becomes his responsibility he's there
[2:09:37] and he has to tend to
[2:09:40] her right and came for me how many's
[2:09:44] glad that we have a Heavenly Father we
[2:09:47] have a Heavenly husband that loves us
[2:09:51] when he's telling the husband to love
[2:09:52] the wives I'm here and God said I'm
[2:09:55] going to love my
[2:09:59] church I'm going to love my
[2:10:02] people
[2:10:03] amen for it that he might sancy and
[2:10:07] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[2:10:09] by the word that he might present it to
[2:10:11] himself a glorious church not having
[2:10:14] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[2:10:16] that it should be holy and without
[2:10:19] blemish woo how many of us say I'd love
[2:10:23] to have a perfect husband husbands might
[2:10:25] say I want to have a perfect wife but
[2:10:27] guess what you're responsible for
[2:10:31] that
[2:10:33] amen and God is responsible to see to it
[2:10:36] that we are without spot without blemish
[2:10:38] just exactly like God wants
[2:10:42] us
[2:10:44] amen amen so ought men to love their
[2:10:48] wives as their own bodies he that loveth
[2:10:49] his wife loveth him himself for no man
[2:10:53] ever hated his own flesh but nourishes
[2:10:55] and cherish it even as the Lord does the
[2:10:59] church if I could say anything under the
[2:11:01] inspiration is I believe that the Lord
[2:11:04] wants to have a more intimate
[2:11:05] relationship with each and every one of
[2:11:08] us how many knows that just doing
[2:11:10] Miracles this out or the other isn't
[2:11:12] isn't all of it because there's all
[2:11:15] people out there having faith to do it
[2:11:17] because on that day he says Haven we
[2:11:18] done this and haven't we done that he
[2:11:20] says I never had a relationship with you
[2:11:23] I never knew you
[2:11:26] intimately how many beli that walking
[2:11:28] with the Lord is a daily
[2:11:31] Affair you having a fellowship with the
[2:11:33] Lord Jesus Christ about everything that
[2:11:36] you do how many believes the wife is
[2:11:39] supposed to be subject to her husband in
[2:11:41] everything spiritually speaking also
[2:11:43] isn't that right in everything be
[2:11:46] subject to our Lord Lord do you want me
[2:11:50] to do or don't you Lord I don't know
[2:11:53] about you but I pray God what do you
[2:11:54] want me to do today and whatever I'm
[2:11:56] doing I don't care
[2:12:00] what what it is Lord I want you there
[2:12:02] and bless say I know it makes a
[2:12:04] difference when I commit my day to God
[2:12:05] and I ask for him to lead me and to
[2:12:07] guide
[2:12:09] me amen especially pouring
[2:12:14] concrete Lord help this not to set up
[2:12:16] I've had nightmy it's all hard brother
[2:12:18] Tommy you all know about it we pray
[2:12:20] before you come over there Lord got you
[2:12:22] know anything you do an intimate
[2:12:25] relationship with almighty
[2:12:28] God Amen think about
[2:12:31] it how many how many's glad for the plan
[2:12:34] of God I think God had a wonderful plan
[2:12:38] I think it was perfect before he ever
[2:12:39] started it he knew the end from the
[2:12:42] beginning before it ever before he cast
[2:12:44] the first star out there before he even
[2:12:47] made the first Angel he already knew
[2:12:49] exactly how it would all end
[2:12:52] how many's glad to be in a god like that
[2:12:54] who cares brother BR says nothing's out
[2:12:56] of cater everything's going just exactly
[2:12:58] like it's supposed to our president
[2:13:00] doing what he did with Easters making an
[2:13:02] absolute blasphemy out of it he needs to
[2:13:05] do
[2:13:07] that why because he's got to get more
[2:13:11] filthy he's got to get so filthy that
[2:13:14] when God destroys this place he's 110%
[2:13:17] just in burning
[2:13:20] them
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:23] cuz remember this ever since America
[2:13:25] turned down God in 1957 he hasn't been
[2:13:28] for us that's right right no when they
[2:13:32] turned him down but says don't even pray
[2:13:34] for it there's no coming back for
[2:13:37] America was he right or was he wrong he
[2:13:39] was absolutely right he says it won't
[2:13:42] beong in the whole world go completely
[2:13:44] insane folks right there complete
[2:13:50] Insanity
[2:13:52] then brother Braham says there'll be a
[2:13:53] woman dressed in some kind of a
[2:13:56] purple and if yall remember uh uh vice
[2:13:59] president Harris you had that purple
[2:14:01] kind same color dress on that was
[2:14:04] identified by the prophet of God my
[2:14:06] question is did that prophecy come and
[2:14:08] go and we didn't catch
[2:14:10] it he said to a woman be in power like
[2:14:13] president or in some great office isn't
[2:14:15] that right that is a great office vice
[2:14:18] president is definitely a great office
[2:14:20] and a woman in that you better have your
[2:14:22] eyes how been no these things happen so
[2:14:24] simple and so easy we don't recognize it
[2:14:26] if you aren't careful I'm not saying it
[2:14:28] is but I say like the prophet of God
[2:14:30] could it be that that woman is already
[2:14:32] there and the next thing was
[2:14:35] fire hello how many B we're right at the
[2:14:38] moment of fire fixing the
[2:14:41] fall well I'm expecting a pressure I'm
