[17:45] 3 my son forget not my law but let thine
[17:49] heart keep my
[17:55] Commandments let not mercy and Truth for

[18:55] wisdom and the man that GTH
[18:57] understanding
[19:06] he is more precious than rubies and all
[19:08] the things thou can desire are not to be
[19:10] compared unto
[19:16] her this one together her ways are ways
[19:19] of pleasantness and all her paths are
[19:22] peace God bless you may be seated
[19:24] brother
[19:27] Brian
[19:37] morning brothers and
[19:40] sisters before I get started um if you
[19:44] would turn over to Isaiah the 12th
[19:52] chapter it'll be a week or two before I
[19:55] get back in church I'm having my surgery
[19:57] in the morning for my need but I thought
[20:00] I'd go over this I mentioned it back in
[20:02] the prayer room in the U in the general
[20:06] fund there's about $122,000 as of about
[20:11] $12,300 and in the building fund there's
[20:14] about $5,500 in the building fund and
[20:19] and I haven't made a deposit but um well
[20:22] I will try to make a deposit by the end
[20:24] of next week um so that's where the
[20:28] finances are all the bills are paid uh
[20:31] all everything's been paid up to date
[20:34] and there's about a about $1900 left in
[20:38] the Fuel Fund so I'll actually before my
[20:40] surgery in the morning call for them to
[20:43] fill the tanks up one more time uh we're
[20:47] down to about 40% and I'll just be
[20:49] honest I know I say this a lot but when
[20:52] when it gets cold like this the heat
[20:53] doesn't shut off it just runs all the
[20:56] time that's we got got a floor system
[20:59] but uh something more important I was
[21:02] that one quote that was up there the
[21:04] thing the last sentence in it really
[21:06] struck me um he said that your life
[21:09] should testify it should have all these
[21:11] examples in it you know Faith honesty
[21:14] charity all those things you should be
[21:17] coming out from the abundance of your
[21:19] heart and the spirit being inside you
[21:21] but the last thing he said there was no
[21:24] guarantee that you were baptized in the
[21:25] Holy Ghost it really struck me that you
[21:28] could still do all the right things and
[21:31] if you hadn't got quiet enough in your
[21:33] spirit and surrendered your whole life
[21:36] everything that you are to Jesus Christ
[21:39] it still wouldn't mean anything it
[21:41] really it it's
[21:44] really a real sobering thought to
[21:47] realize it's not a game you don't play
[21:49] with it everything about it is important
[21:52] it's your very life your very salvation
[21:55] is based upon you totally surrendering
[21:58] in everything you are to Jesus Christ
[22:00] this morning and I was uh I missed that
[22:04] this is a short chapter
[22:07] here um I'll just read what it has to
[22:09] say it's only about I think it's six or
[22:11] seven verses here in Isaiah and in that
[22:14] day shalt say oh Lord I will praise thee
[22:17] though thou was angry with me thine
[22:19] anger is turned away thou comforted me
[22:22] and you know like brother Rand said all
[22:25] the preachers tell you when you read the
[22:26] word of God you you got to see yourself
[22:28] in it if you can't see yourself in it
[22:31] you're going to have a problem accepting
[22:32] it and he goes on to say behold God is
[22:35] my salvation and that's true this
[22:37] morning for all of us this morning God
[22:39] is my salvation I will trust be not
[22:43] afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my
[22:45] strength my song he has also become my
[22:48] salvation you know and I was out there
[22:52] and I was just thinking this morning
[22:53] everything out there if you let it it'll
[22:56] AAP the very joy out of your heart and
[22:59] out of your life this morning and the
[23:01] only way you keep that Joy is to stay in
[23:04] God's word and he goes on to say here
[23:06] therefore with joy shall we draw water
[23:08] out of the wells of
[23:12] salvation of the Holy Ghost and your
[23:14] heart and life it's your willingness to
[23:16] yield yourself to Jesus Christ this
[23:18] morning that keeps that joy in your
[23:20] heart that abides in you and he goes on
[23:22] to say here and in that day shall
[23:25] you and in that day shall you praise the
[23:28] Lord call upon his name declare his
[23:31] doings among the people make mention the
[23:34] name his name is exalted sing unto the
[23:37] Lord for he ha done excellent
[23:40] things this is known in all the Earth
[23:42] cry out and Shout the inhabitants of
[23:44] Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel
[23:47] in the midst of thee and I'm going to
[23:50] jump over here if you want you can turn
[23:52] to Matthew the 19th and 20th
[23:55] chapter but I was uh read reading that
[23:58] devotional again this morning I'm I'm
[24:01] not going to read this whole paragraph
[24:02] but really struck me
[24:05] about this I'll read this uh chapter
[24:08] here and this 20 I'll actually read out
[24:11] of the 20th chapter now you can study
[24:14] all night and study all day and when you
[24:16] come up here I anyone that's come up
[24:19] behind this pulit to tell you your very
[24:21] thoughts and everything you do you want
[24:23] God to be in it you don't want to take
[24:25] your own ideas and your own ways you
[24:27] just want to let God have his way so
[24:29] sometimes when I'm up here I might I I
[24:33] really careful about the things I say
[24:35] but if I let the word of God speak for
[24:37] itself and you know it it may bring
[24:41] about a change in my life and everyone
[24:42] else but this is the 11th Hour this is
[24:45] where Jesus talks about the people I'll
[24:47] just read it let it speak for itself for
[24:50] the Kingdom of Heaven is like a a man
[24:52] that is in a householder and went out
[24:54] early in the morning to hire laborers
[24:56] into the venue and that's where we're
[24:58] all at this morning you I don't know
[25:00] what hour you were hired at but God
[25:02] knows what hour you were hired at this
[25:03] morning and when he agreed with the
[25:06] laborers for a penni's day he sent them
[25:09] into the vineyard you know I always find
[25:11] it striking when I read God's word God
[25:13] just doesn't want you to be lazy and lay
[25:15] around he actually wants you to work and
[25:17] be be productive and whatever you are
[25:20] both spiritually and naturally he went
[25:22] out about the third hour and saw others
[25:24] standing in the idle in the marketplace
[25:28] you know and and he said unto them go ye
[25:30] also into the vineyard and whatsoever is
[25:32] right I will give you and they went
[25:34] their way so you see hour after hour he
[25:37] kept on finding people that could work
[25:39] for him and again he went about the
[25:41] sixth the ninth hour he did
[25:44] likewise and about the 11th hour he went
[25:47] out and found others standing idle and
[25:49] he said unto them why stand you here all
[25:52] the day idle so idleness is not a good
[25:55] thing and he goes on to say they said
[25:57] said unto him because no man hath hired
[26:00] us he saith unto them go you also into
[26:03] the vineyard on whatsoever is right that
[26:06] shall ye receive so when they so when
[26:09] evening was come the Lord of The
[26:11] Vineyard said unto his Steward call the
[26:13] laborers and give them their hire
[26:15] beginning with the last unto the first
[26:18] and when they came that excuse me when
[26:20] they came that were hired about the 11th
[26:23] Hour they received every man
[26:26] his his Penny you know when I think of
[26:30] that as honest thought you know working
[26:33] 12 hours a day for just a penny that's
[26:35] an awesome thought right there you
[26:38] realize how blessed we really are in
[26:40] this day and age in
[26:42] 2024 but when the first came they they
[26:45] supposed that they should have received
[26:47] more they likewise received every man
[26:50] his pending and they have received it
[26:52] they murmured against the Good Men of
[26:54] the house saying these last I've brought
[26:57] but one hour and I was just thinking
[26:59] this morning as I was reading this you
[27:02] know whether you're a old Christian a
[27:04] young Christian wherever your experience
[27:07] is God blesses people in different
[27:10] levels at different times and and the
[27:13] most important thing is not to be
[27:15] jealous of what other what God is doing
[27:17] for someone else just to realize that
[27:19] God is more than able to do something
[27:21] for you this morning and
[27:23] saying the last I've brought for but one
[27:26] hour thou has made them people onto us
[27:28] which have borne the burden of the heat
[27:30] of the day but he answered one of them
[27:32] and said friend I do these no wrong did
[27:35] this that not agree with me for a penny
[27:38] take thine is and go this way and I will
[27:41] give on to the last even as I and I got
[27:43] to raise my hand here because that's
[27:45] where I'm at you know we're in that last
[27:47] day Ministry ourselves and God whatever
[27:49] he gave to the ones in the beginning
[27:51] he's going to give to us in the end it
[27:53] is not lawful for me to do that which
[27:56] with my own is th own I evil because I
[27:59] am good so the last shall be first and
[28:02] the first last but many be called but
[28:05] few are chosen I was just thinking this
[28:06] morning you know as the world goes
[28:09] that's where we're
[28:10] at you know I was thinking this
[28:14] morning you know I can I can I know I
[28:17] say this a lot I don't mean to say
[28:19] things but I honestly mean this I can as
[28:22] a Christian I really I can only speak
[28:24] for myself where I'm at in my experience
[28:27] this morning with Jesus Christ and just
[28:30] like you all you can only speak for
[28:32] yourself you know where you're at this
[28:34] morning you know your struggles you know
[28:37] your high points you know your low
[28:39] points and if you're a Christian this
[28:41] morning and you don't know who you are
[28:42] or what you really are then it's not the
[28:46] time to be just hly going down the
[28:49] course of Life Without Really knowing
[28:51] who you are and how the word of God
[28:53] looks at
[28:55] you not how your brother or sister looks
[28:58] at you but how the word of God in Jesus
[29:00] Christ looks at you that in this coming
[29:02] year that's the most important thing I
[29:04] could think as a Christian this morning
[29:06] and I'm not going to read this whole
[29:07] thing I know I say that a lot but at the
[29:10] end of this thing really struck
[29:12] me we you know we all have examples what
[29:15] we look at as a you know as a child you
[29:17] look at your father you look at your
[29:19] mother you try to emulate them you try
[29:21] to not to use big word you try to copy
[29:24] them try to be like them and then when
[29:26] you get to be a teenager like all you
[29:28] got to be a teenager and a young man and
[29:31] you seen the faults in your father and
[29:33] mother so you so but we have an example
[29:38] that we can follow this morning where
[29:39] there is no false in that's Jesus Christ
[29:42] this morning and brother brandom said
[29:44] and the word says look for good examples
[29:47] to to follow look for good examples to
[29:52] make your life align with and I'll just
[29:54] read what he had to say and sit
[29:56] down he said when I I'm at if you went
[30:00] to the devotional for today I'm about
[30:02] halfway down in this quot when I first
[30:04] come among you groups 10 years ago to
[30:07] look like a church but today it looks
[30:08] like the world and we I I can think for
[30:12] myself that just the message of the hour
[30:14] you know there's so many different
[30:16] opinions so many different ways this
[30:18] morning he could he would probably say
[30:20] the same thing about us he today it
[30:23] looks like the world it's the truth
[30:25] something happened somewhere you got to
[30:28] wearing better clothes you got to making
[30:30] a little more money and
[30:32] it's just made you a sap out out of you
[30:36] that's all now now that's truth you're
[30:38] right you're trying to act like the rest
[30:40] of the world today is compromising time
[30:43] that's true and I sometimes when I read
[30:45] this you know I think of in 1959 or
[30:49] 1956 you know I wasn't even born but you
[30:52] think of now 2024 how much worse it is
[30:56] seeing forward in time
[30:57] that's true you paint your steps red and
[31:00] watch you see your neighbor doesn't
[31:02] paint in Step red sure you wear a little
[31:05] round hat church with a feather up in it
[31:08] watch all your women come to church with
[31:10] a little round hat and a feather up in
[31:13] it all of them want to look like one
[31:15] another it's a matching time you know
[31:19] and I look at that you don't try to be
[31:21] totally different either you're not
[31:23] trying you know you don't want to be
[31:25] like everyone else but then you don't
[31:27] want to be totally different than
[31:28] everyone else you want to be what God
[31:30] leads you to be you know that's true
[31:33] it's a matching time amen now I'm going
[31:36] to tell you my brother I don't care
[31:38] whether my shoes match your trousers or
[31:40] my trousers match your coat I want my
[31:44] experience to match God's Bible That's
[31:47] the matching time so whether you brother
[31:50] overdresses or underdresses you that
[31:53] doesn't make a difference to you you
[31:55] want your own experience to match God
[31:57] word and matching time if you want to
[31:59] match something match your experience
[32:01] against Paul and we have we have
[32:03] examples in our Bible going back from
[32:05] Genesis all the way to Revelation that
[32:08] we can match our lives that we can
[32:10] emulate I don't mean to use a big word
[32:12] again that we can copy to be a better
[32:15] example amen if you want to match
[32:18] something match your experience against
[32:19] Paul's amen that's what we need today is
[32:22] a matching time with Paul's faith in the
[32:24] Bible what you could say this morning
[32:27] you need to have brother bram's faith in
[32:30] the Bible your P there are examples
[32:32] where you see they have great faith in
[32:34] the word of God that's what we should be
[32:36] em use it again we should be copying
[32:39] this morning that's our example right
[32:42] real matching time don't try to match
[32:44] your neighbor match some saint of the
[32:47] Bible don't look at everyone else look
[32:49] at the examples in God's word if you are

[1:21:47] the 21st and I'm sure all resolutions
[1:21:50] have been broken by
[1:21:51] now
[1:21:54] you know what I'm talking about they're
[1:21:57] made to be broken and uh so after 21
[1:22:01] days you either formed a habit or you've
[1:22:03] broken your resolution and and uh we're
[1:22:06] not going to talk about resolutions
[1:22:08] today but we're going to talk about
[1:22:10] restoration and restoration is what what
[1:22:13] the bride is in a restoration process
[1:22:17] and I want to speak this morning to you
[1:22:19] on restoring God's domain and as we
[1:22:22] begin to preach I want you to think
[1:22:24] about the domain and as we look at what
[1:22:26] a domain is I want you to to understand
[1:22:30] a domain is an area listen to this an
[1:22:32] area of territory owned or controlled by
[1:22:37] a ruler or
[1:22:39] government a domain is an area of
[1:22:41] territory owned or controlled by a ruler
[1:22:44] or government turn in your bibles if you
[1:22:47] would and to Genesis chapter 1 we'll
[1:22:50] also read from Revelations 21
[1:22:54] I preached some of these thoughts in in
[1:22:56] Arizona we thank you for your prayers
[1:22:57] while we were there and I told Brother
[1:22:59] Bor we definitely had Liberty out there
[1:23:01] in brother Ted's Church sends greetings
[1:23:04] uh brother Ted hated that he couldn't be
[1:23:06] here this year and but he uh he just
[1:23:08] loves the people here he loves Kentucky
[1:23:10] probably as much as he does close as
[1:23:12] much as he does Arizona and uh he just
[1:23:15] sends his greetings and we love brother
[1:23:17] Ted and and all he's done for the for
[1:23:19] the Lord and and the his ministry and
[1:23:21] around the world tens of thousands of
[1:23:23] people's no doubt been touched by
[1:23:25] Brother Ted's Ministry and and just a
[1:23:28] just a real real Soldier and Warrior for
[1:23:31] God and I you know I you know I get
[1:23:35] sappy I can't help it but I just think
[1:23:38] about I se and sister Mna and you know
[1:23:42] they gray and hair and I think one day
[1:23:47] all the work all the toil all the
[1:23:51] sacrifice even made for himself his
[1:23:54] family it'll all be a treasure and he'll
[1:23:57] wear a crown for
[1:23:59] that and I just thank Lord help
[1:24:03] me help
[1:24:07] me but uh we thank you for your prayers
[1:24:10] while we were out there our our little
[1:24:12] trip was extended by a couple of days
[1:24:14] most of you probably heard and and uh
[1:24:16] you know the Lord works all things out

[1:24:50] there brother Ron's uh on they were
[1:24:53] given a missionary report and you know I
[1:24:55] just I think about the missionaries and
[1:24:58] and the work that they do and and we
[1:25:00] could just pour so much more into
[1:25:02] Mission work because there's a definite
[1:25:04] need out there and uh but as as the trip
[1:25:08] goes on we're supposed to go and we've
[1:25:09] got our itinerary all lined out where
[1:25:11] we're supposed to be what we're supposed
[1:25:12] to do and we've been traveling we we get
[1:25:15] to our destination and at about 12:30
[1:25:19] a.m. the next day after we've been
[1:25:21] traveling I gu yes we started about 3:00
[1:25:23] a.m. and arrived at our destination at
[1:25:26] at 12:30 so several hours of travel and
[1:25:30] we go into the hotel and I said I need
[1:25:33] I'm here to get my room I've got a
[1:25:35] reservation she says give me your name

[1:26:00] room's not transferable nor is it
[1:26:02] refundable I
[1:26:03] said so I just uh trying to keep my
[1:26:06] composure there and it's my mistake I've
[1:26:08] done it wasn't nothing they done and and
[1:26:10] I'm the whole time think how could you
[1:26:11] do how could you do that how could you
[1:26:13] make that mistake knowing it's
[1:26:14] non-refundable how could you mess this
[1:26:16] up we get in the elevator and I said
[1:26:19] this trip is starting off as a horrible
[1:26:21] trip
[1:26:23] 12:30 in the
[1:26:24] morning this trip is starting off to be
[1:26:27] a horrible
[1:26:29] trip we wake up the next morning 5
[1:26:32] inches of snow on the
[1:26:34] ground praise the
[1:26:37] Lord so now our our itinerary man should
[1:26:40] we go do we go north do we drive through
[1:26:42] this or what do we do you know I don't
[1:26:44] know how the mountains are I've never
[1:26:46] been in that terrain and Flag Staff and
[1:26:48] so anyway long story short we we tread
[1:26:51] on through and we drive through snow and
[1:26:52] ice for I don't know an hour or so to
[1:26:55] get to where halfway to where we were
[1:26:57] going then it clears up and and we get
[1:26:59] up there and and things just start to
[1:27:02] man it just turns into a wonderful trip
[1:27:04] of course my kids now Weston and Carson
[1:27:07] are making fun of me this is horrible
[1:27:09] ain't it that you know it's just on and
[1:27:10] on you know it never it never ends when
[1:27:13] they got something on you it never
[1:27:16] ends and so they're they're never ending
[1:27:19] on us and so on men but it did turned
[1:27:22] out to be just a just a great trip and
[1:27:25] and and God we just got to see so many
[1:27:27] things and spend time with friends and
[1:27:29] ones we hadn't seen maybe in 20 years
[1:27:31] and spend time with brother Russell and
[1:27:34] he took us out riding and and uh they
[1:27:37] got more stories on me they they
[1:27:39] probably share videos if you ask but uh
[1:27:42] they got more stories on me of where I
[1:27:45] they can laugh at me and that's okay I'm
[1:27:47] I take it so but uh long story short we
[1:27:50] get to the uh getting ready to come home
[1:27:53] and I'm getting ready to go out and
[1:27:54] preach and I'm you know you're always on
[1:27:55] your mind what's next on the list I'm
[1:27:57] you know we got to leave here at certain
[1:27:59] certain time to get to the airport and
[1:28:00] I'm gonna go out got to go preach so I
[1:28:02] get ready to go out to the to the you
[1:28:04] know get ready to go out to to preach
[1:28:05] and I get a message your flight's been
[1:28:07] cancelled due to weather and I think man
[1:28:10] this is not what I need to hear right
[1:28:12] now this is not what I need to hear
[1:28:14] right now so we uh we prayed brother Ted
[1:28:17] and myself and the church prayed and
[1:28:19] things would work out and you know what
[1:28:21] it always works out out it always works
[1:28:24] out if we can just keep oursel out of
[1:28:25] the way keep our emotions keep our
[1:28:27] feelings out of the way and just say God
[1:28:30] you're in control this trip was
[1:28:32] pre-planned before the foundation I
[1:28:34] can't change one day of it there's not
[1:28:36] one thing I can say that would be
[1:28:38] different and just just you take control
[1:28:41] and so that's what we did and and uh it
[1:28:43] worked out and and hotel was available
[1:28:46] and and they told of our situ God
[1:28:49] blessed us with a with a nicer room so
[1:28:52] you know it just God is good to his to
[1:28:54] his people and if we commit things to
[1:28:56] him so we was able to spend more time
[1:28:58] and visit and and while you were at ne4
[1:29:00] we were at
[1:29:01] 65 so I'm not complaining at all about
[1:29:05] that so God is good and uh and and he's
[1:29:10] good to us all the time but as we we get
[1:29:12] into the to the word here I'm going to
[1:29:14] preach and restoring God's domain and
[1:29:17] let me just start kind of start over it
[1:29:19] get this back in your head let's change
[1:29:20] gears that we've got got that got that
[1:29:23] out there and uh just just to say thank
[1:29:25] you for your prayers but God's domain
[1:29:29] restoring God's domain so a domain is an
[1:29:31] area of territory owned or controlled by
[1:29:33] a ruler or government and brother Bram
[1:29:37] he he picks up here and he says brother
[1:29:38] Neville preached this morning a notable
[1:29:41] message and the last thing he said on
[1:29:43] his last thoughts was to be restored and
[1:29:47] so it gave me an idea right there to
[1:29:49] restore and he said now I I got my
[1:29:52] dictionary and I got the scripture notes
[1:29:54] and I begin to copy some things down and
[1:29:56] and I got Webster's Dictionary to find
[1:29:58] out the right definition for ReStore and
[1:30:01] he said restore means to return to the
[1:30:04] former owner or to bring back the former
[1:30:08] estate of a condition and he said and we
[1:30:12] can enforce a claim to be
[1:30:15] restored so we as Believers can enforce
[1:30:19] a claim to be restored he now Webster
[1:30:22] says it means to bring back to its
[1:30:24] former owner owner or bring back to a
[1:30:27] former state of condition and if the
[1:30:29] claim is made on something it to make a
[1:30:32] restoration you can enforce it to make
[1:30:35] it come back to its right place to
[1:30:38] restore means bring back to claim a
[1:30:40] claim can be enforced now to bring
[1:30:43] anything back to its rightful owner
[1:30:45] listen what he says where it
[1:30:48] belongs where it belongs you see we have
[1:30:51] rights and we have privileges that Satan
[1:30:53] has taken away from us in time and he's
[1:30:56] come down he's begin to Rob us of the
[1:30:58] things that we enjoy and things that God
[1:31:00] wants us to have in our lives but the
[1:31:02] word tells us he says it can be restored
[1:31:05] to where they belong and he says
[1:31:08] therefore there's some way some way
[1:31:10] listen what he said how he words things
[1:31:12] is amazing to me but he says and there's
[1:31:16] there's some way it went away from its
[1:31:18] rightful
[1:31:19] owner some way it went way some
[1:31:22] something happened some there was a
[1:31:24] circumstance or an inant and something
[1:31:26] happened and maybe it was your joy maybe
[1:31:28] it was your righteousness maybe it was
[1:31:29] your love maybe it was the peace that
[1:31:32] God gives you of understanding in his
[1:31:34] word somehow that be to to leave away
[1:31:38] from its rightful owner and he says it
[1:31:40] can wander around
[1:31:44] anywhere so now the very things the
[1:31:46] Privileges and the goodness that God has
[1:31:48] given you now has beg to wander around
[1:31:51] anywhere when Satan gets his hands in
[1:31:54] it and he said but to restore means
[1:31:57] being bring back to who really owns it
[1:32:01] you really own
[1:32:02] righteousness you really own forgiveness
[1:32:06] you really own Joy these are things that
[1:32:09] you own privileges that God has given
[1:32:11] you and I as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:13] you own it and he says or to bring it
[1:32:15] back to its natural state bring it back
[1:32:18] brothers and sisters we own overcoming
[1:32:21] power power we own Victory this morning
[1:32:26] we own all of these things do we own
[1:32:29] gifts we own healings we own Miracles
[1:32:33] it's not just for a day gone by but we
[1:32:36] own it it's just out there wandering
[1:32:38] somewhere waiting for you to get the
[1:32:40] restoration to pull it back into your
[1:32:43] rightful
[1:32:45] ownership you say I've never seen a
[1:32:47] miracle it's out there for you I've
[1:32:49] never seen a healing it's out there for
[1:32:55] you and in order for you to do
[1:32:59] this in order for you to do this you
[1:33:02] have a right to
[1:33:05] enforce you have to enforce this
[1:33:07] rightful condition of restoration to
[1:33:13] restore now if you would stand to your
[1:33:15] feet and we'll read the word we've laid
[1:33:17] a
[1:33:19] foundation amen
[1:33:23] Genesis chapter 1 we're going to take
[1:33:26] our time this morning
[1:33:28] and my my notes as I got up at three
[1:33:31] this morning they grew from four pages
[1:33:33] to nine pages to 13 pages to 20
[1:33:37] Pages thank God we've got next Sunday
[1:33:41] too but we're going to break it up and
[1:33:44] and we do want to take our time though
[1:33:45] so I'm I'm watching the
[1:33:47] clock Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning
[1:33:51] God created the heavens and the Earth so
[1:33:55] we see here from the very beginning that
[1:33:57] God was building and God has a carpenter
[1:34:00] in his mind and he has a goal in his
[1:34:02] mind of what he wanted his creation to
[1:34:04] be he had an image in his mind and said
[1:34:07] this is what will happen when I create
[1:34:10] the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth
[1:34:13] was without form and void and the
[1:34:14] Darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:34:16] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:34:18] face of the waters and God said let
[1:34:21] there be light and there was light and
[1:34:23] God saw the light that it was good and
[1:34:26] God divided the light from the darkness
[1:34:30] so right here we can see in the very
[1:34:32] beginning in Genesis we see that there
[1:34:34] is a light and there is a Darkness so we
[1:34:36] can spiritually we can say there is a
[1:34:38] separation we can see the two forces
[1:34:40] working in the framework of the church
[1:34:42] in the very beginning in the creation a
[1:34:44] light and a
[1:34:47] dark and God called the light day and
[1:34:50] the Darkness he called night and the
[1:34:52] evening and the morning were the first
[1:34:54] day Revelations
[1:34:57] 21 find your place
[1:35:02] there so we see in Genesis as we just
[1:35:05] read we see God presenting himself as
[1:35:08] the
[1:35:09] alpha the beginning where it all
[1:35:13] started Revelations 21 we see six things
[1:35:17] happen as we read this scripture we see
[1:35:19] a new Heaven we see a new Earth A New
[1:35:23] Earth we see a new people we see a New
[1:35:25] Jerusalem we see a new Temple and we see
[1:35:27] a new
[1:35:28] light and it says in in Revelations 21
[1:35:32] and I saw new Heaven and new earth for
[1:35:34] the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:35:35] were passed away and there were no more
[1:35:37] sea and I John saw the holy city a New
[1:35:41] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:35:43] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:35:45] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:35:48] out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:35:50] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:35:52] will dwell with them and they shall be
[1:35:54] his people and God
[1:35:56] himself shall be with them and be whose
[1:36:00] God their
[1:36:02] God their God our God my
[1:36:05] God and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:36:08] behold I make all things
[1:36:12] new what a
[1:36:14] restoration behold I make all things new
[1:36:18] and he said unto me right for these
[1:36:20] words are true true and faithful and he
[1:36:23] said unto me it is done
[1:36:27] Omega it is done it is done I'm the
[1:36:30] alpha and the Omega the beginning and
[1:36:33] the end in other words brothers and
[1:36:34] sisters we have no need to worry we have
[1:36:37] no need to fear no need to fret we don't
[1:36:40] have to be concerned or consumed because
[1:36:42] this is a finished work and God finishes
[1:36:45] what he
[1:36:47] starts if God has started a work in your
[1:36:50] life he will finish finish that
[1:36:52] [Applause]
[1:36:54] work he that overcometh shall inherit
[1:36:56] all things and I will be his God and he
[1:36:58] shall be my son you may have your
[1:37:05] seats if you want to thumb real quick to
[1:37:08] Matthew 21 I'm going to read just
[1:37:09] another portion there just to keep
[1:37:11] building on what we've what we've
[1:37:12] started with but I think you see where
[1:37:14] we're going God is in control God will
[1:37:17] restore all that is a lost all that is
[1:37:20] wward all that all it's missing in your
[1:37:22] life there is a restoration taking place
[1:37:25] Matthew 21 we have to be able to accept
[1:37:28] what God can do through US many times I
[1:37:31] think we fear that we're not good enough
[1:37:33] for God to work through us we're not
[1:37:35] spiritual enough for God to work through
[1:37:37] us or we think that maybe God just
[1:37:39] simply don't work through us that's not
[1:37:43] true the bride will be a working living
[1:37:47] Act of God just as it was in the days of
[1:37:50] Pentecost
[1:37:51] when God come down and and and poured
[1:37:54] himself out on that group of people they
[1:37:55] were living working breathing acting God
[1:37:59] for their
[1:38:00] [Music]
[1:38:00] [Applause]
[1:38:02] hour Matthew 21 familiar story here now
[1:38:06] in the morning as he returned into the
[1:38:08] city hungered so here is God now Jesus
[1:38:12] is showing us his his uh his human side
[1:38:16] every one of us can be familiar with
[1:38:18] that we know what it means to hunger
[1:38:20] even from a baby out of the womb they
[1:38:22] cry when they're what hungry and Jesus
[1:38:25] says here I'm hungered and he saw a fig
[1:38:29] tree in the way and he came to it and he
[1:38:30] found nothing there on but leaves and
[1:38:33] said unto it let no fruit grow on thee
[1:38:36] henceforth forever and presently the Fig
[1:38:39] Tree withered away and when the
[1:38:42] disciples saw it they
[1:38:45] marel and saying how soon is the Fig
[1:38:48] Tree withered away now watch here what
[1:38:52] Jesus says to him he answered and said
[1:38:55] unto him verily I say unto ye if ye have
[1:38:58] faith and doubt
[1:39:01] not ye shall not only do this which is
[1:39:04] done to the Fig Tree but you shall also
[1:39:08] say unto this mountain be thou removed
[1:39:10] and cast into the sea and it shall be
[1:39:13] done and all things whatsoever you asked
[1:39:17] in prayer believing you shall receive
[1:39:22] in other words if you have a
[1:39:24] domain if you have domain in your life
[1:39:27] if you have an area in your life that
[1:39:29] you are completely controlling through
[1:39:31] the Holy Ghost all these things are
[1:39:37] possible now in the
[1:39:40] beginning I'm G to take my time and just
[1:39:43] kind of go through some of
[1:39:45] this in the beginning here God begins to
[1:39:48] create and he creates the Heaven and the
[1:39:50] Earth and I want you to see that as God
[1:39:52] begins to create he has a thought in his
[1:39:55] mind and God begins to build upon these
[1:39:58] thoughts and God speaks and things come
[1:40:02] into existence which never were
[1:40:05] before the universe itself is simply
[1:40:08] created by the spoken word of God did
[1:40:11] you ever realize that the spoken word we
[1:40:14] talk about the spoken word we have to
[1:40:17] have the spoken word of God in our lives
[1:40:19] what does that spoken word do it creates
[1:40:22] the atmosphere around us and God is
[1:40:25] there looking at this now this universe
[1:40:26] is being created by God's spoken word
[1:40:29] brothers and sisters this is not an
[1:40:31] accident this is not a mistake but this
[1:40:33] is God's self-expression of almighty God
[1:40:36] using the spoken word as an example of
[1:40:39] how he
[1:40:41] operates how he operated then is how he
[1:40:44] operated in Jesus how he operated in
[1:40:47] Jesus is how he operated on the day of
[1:40:49] Pentecost how he operated on the the day
[1:40:51] of Pentecost is how he should be
[1:40:52] operated in you and
[1:40:57] I there is an order to this
[1:41:00] creation on day one God creates the
[1:41:03] light and separates it from the darkness
[1:41:05] and he forms the day and the night and
[1:41:07] he begins to separate the waters and
[1:41:10] creates the skies and on day three he
[1:41:13] separates the dry land from the sea now
[1:41:15] keep in mind all of these are essential
[1:41:18] for what is to follow
[1:41:21] you see God's not surprised by what's
[1:41:25] happening in your life this
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:29] morning he wake up and say oh my
[1:41:32] goodness I can't believe what's happened
[1:41:33] in Brian Baldwin's life
[1:41:35] today he never said that but he's got a
[1:41:40] creation in order and you are I are a
[1:41:42] part of that creation so God knows
[1:41:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:47] exactly what we'll be going through the
[1:41:49] life we'll be going through what's
[1:41:51] happening in your life today and he sets
[1:41:54] all this in order and he meticulously
[1:41:56] plans all of this out and God begins to
[1:42:00] fill the Realms that he's created so on
[1:42:03] the remainder of the third day he
[1:42:04] creates plant life and on day four he
[1:42:08] creates the Sun the moon the
[1:42:12] stars he has to create the Sun the moon
[1:42:14] the stars for the plant life to
[1:42:17] live he couldn't put the cart in front
[1:42:19] of the horse
[1:42:21] he had to do it in sequence he had to do
[1:42:23] it in order he had to know what was
[1:42:24] coming on day five God fills the water
[1:42:27] in the sky with fish and birds that
[1:42:29] could not have survived without plant
[1:42:30] life you see what I'm
[1:42:33] saying sometimes we think our life is
[1:42:35] all in
[1:42:36] chaos but God says I've got an order
[1:42:39] I've got a plan I know how to create
[1:42:42] this is not this is not anything new to
[1:42:45] me nor does anything surprise me right
[1:42:49] finally on day six six God begins to
[1:42:52] create the
[1:42:53] animals and then he comes to the Apex of
[1:42:55] his
[1:42:56] creation
[1:42:59] Humanity Humanity where where God wants
[1:43:01] to populate the land he looks there in
[1:43:04] Genesis 1 and 26 and he says let us make
[1:43:06] man in our image after our likeness and
[1:43:10] let him them have
[1:43:14] domain you see
[1:43:16] that let them have domain over the fish
[1:43:19] of the sea and over the fowl the air and
[1:43:21] over the cattle and over the Earth and
[1:43:22] every creeping thing upon the Earth so
[1:43:25] God created man in his own
[1:43:28] image he did not create man in the
[1:43:31] likeness of the
[1:43:32] world he didn't make man in the likeness
[1:43:35] of your
[1:43:37] church he didn't make man in the
[1:43:39] likeness of the government or the
[1:43:41] schools you attend he didn't even make
[1:43:44] man in the likeness of what man thought
[1:43:46] he should
[1:43:47] be because if I was created if I created
[1:43:50] myself myself the way I thought I should
[1:43:51] be it sure wouldn't work and fit into
[1:43:54] God's
[1:43:56] plans well some of you is
[1:43:58] honest because without the Holy Spirit
[1:44:01] In Our Lives leading us and guiding us
[1:44:02] we can be so far off the Mark we don't
[1:44:04] even know where we would be we just
[1:44:07] drift through life through streams of
[1:44:09] time not knowing what what would be the
[1:44:11] next curve down the
[1:44:13] road but he created him in his own image
[1:44:16] and he said he created them to be
[1:44:18] fruitful and to multiply and rep
[1:44:20] replenish the Earth and subdue it look
[1:44:23] at that word subdue subdue means to
[1:44:26] conquer and to bring it into
[1:44:29] subjection it means to bring it under
[1:44:32] control so God now has creating this man
[1:44:36] and woman them to subdue and have
[1:44:39] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:44:40] over the foul of the air and over every
[1:44:42] living thing that
[1:44:44] moveth to have dominion over
[1:44:47] it to conquer it to bring get into
[1:44:54] subjection we need God to subdue in our
[1:44:57] life we need some subduing power in our
[1:45:01] lives toward the things that that Hound
[1:45:03] us the things that hinder us the things
[1:45:04] that lead us away from God that we can
[1:45:07] take complete control over that that we
[1:45:09] can conquer it and bring it under
[1:45:12] subjection to the Holy
[1:45:16] Ghost I'm gonna get ahead of myself from
[1:45:18] next week but I was just thinking this
[1:45:19] morning I thought you know what if we
[1:45:21] would bring everything under subjection
[1:45:23] through the Holy Ghost the TV wouldn't
[1:45:25] say vile words your computer wouldn't
[1:45:28] look at dirty
[1:45:30] pictures why because you brought sub you
[1:45:33] brought under subjection and you subdued
[1:45:35] it under the power of the Holy
[1:45:39] Ghost in Philippians
[1:45:42] 3 Philippians 3 verse 20 if you're
[1:45:45] taking notes Christ here is the object
[1:45:49] of what the Believers expectation should
[1:45:51] be and he's speaking and he says our
[1:45:54] conversation is in heaven from whence we
[1:45:56] also look for our savior the Lord Jesus
[1:45:59] Christ who shall change our vile body
[1:46:03] that it may be fashioned unto his
[1:46:05] glorious
[1:46:06] body huh according to the works why
[1:46:10] whereby he is able even to what subdue
[1:46:16] all things unto himself so this verse
[1:46:21] this this phrase right here subdue all
[1:46:23] things it adds more detail to the
[1:46:25] picture of Oneness that God and Christ
[1:46:27] and you all
[1:46:30] one well some of you believe you're a
[1:46:32] child of God come on church I said God
[1:46:36] and Christ and you you're all one you're
[1:46:38] all made from the same mold why because
[1:46:40] he made you in his very image what he
[1:46:43] wanted you to
[1:46:44] [Applause]
[1:46:47] be subdue
[1:46:49] here means it's a it's a Hebrew Greek
[1:46:53] word h
[1:46:55] the it means to place in order to place
[1:46:59] in an orderly
[1:47:02] fashion it describes a scene of
[1:47:07] chaos it describes a a life uh that is
[1:47:11] disorganized it describes a life that is
[1:47:14] disarrayed and out of pattern out of
[1:47:17] sequence but when you take this word
[1:47:19] subdue right here in this verse it means
[1:47:22] that somebody has come in and somebody
[1:47:24] has come in and begin to rearrange the
[1:47:26] scattered
[1:47:28] pieces Jesus Christ has come into our
[1:47:31] lives and begin to rearrange your
[1:47:34] scattered pieces Jesus Christ can come
[1:47:36] into your life and rearrange your homes
[1:47:39] he can rearrange your marriage he can
[1:47:41] rearrange your children your children
[1:47:44] may get scattered they may go here they
[1:47:45] may go there but right here when it says
[1:47:47] Jesus subdues all things he's bringing
[1:47:51] the broken pieces back into perfect
[1:47:55] order we won't leave here out of
[1:48:00] order so brothers and sisters this lets
[1:48:02] us know that God's
[1:48:04] power God's power is more than
[1:48:08] sufficient his power is more than
[1:48:10] sufficient to create and maintain the
[1:48:13] creation from which he started in his
[1:48:15] Believers and we don't have to worry
[1:48:17] that God's going to run out of steam or
[1:48:19] run out of gas or going to give up on us
[1:48:21] we don't have to worry about that we
[1:48:22] don't have to worry that the world
[1:48:23] around us is falling apart FOX News
[1:48:26] tells you it is CNN tells you it is but
[1:48:30] God's got you in a perfect place in a
[1:48:32] perfect position in a perfect order to
[1:48:36] do exactly what he wants you to
[1:48:39] do you wasn't born in this last hour by
[1:48:43] chance no it's a blessing from God you
[1:48:47] say man I wish I'd have been back there
[1:48:48] when Paul was there I wish have been
[1:48:50] back there when when Jesus was there no
[1:48:52] you're living in the greatest hour you
[1:48:54] could live in you will see the Rapture
[1:48:57] of the church and the Holy Ghost come
[1:48:59] down and pick up his
[1:49:06] blood I believe
[1:49:09] it she's getting her life in
[1:49:18] order do realize that no matter how Grim
[1:49:21] it looks no matter how how destitute you
[1:49:25] may feel or how how your Earthly eyes
[1:49:28] look there is no battle there's no
[1:49:29] forces there's no sickness there's no
[1:49:31] Devils there's no demons there's no hell
[1:49:33] that can come upon you that God can't
[1:49:37] have dominion
[1:49:38] [Applause]
[1:49:43] over why is
[1:49:45] that because God can't undo his
[1:49:48] creation he can't undo do his creation
[1:49:50] and say uhoh my bride over here they
[1:49:53] don't deserve this so I'm going to just
[1:49:55] let Satan pour out everything he's got
[1:49:57] on them he can't do that God can't undo
[1:50:00] what he started and so for the believer
[1:50:03] we have an absolute we have an assurance
[1:50:06] that God will finish what he starts in
[1:50:08] our lives you say well my road is so
[1:50:10] Rocky I don't even know if God is
[1:50:13] here how many's ever been
[1:50:15] there we've all been there what is that
[1:50:18] it's called trials
[1:50:20] it's called being an overcomer it's
[1:50:23] called relying upon God and finding
[1:50:25] yourself in the
[1:50:27] word and standing upon on that word and
[1:50:31] believing that God is going to see you
[1:50:34] [Applause]
[1:50:36] through you see during this time between
[1:50:39] Genesis 1 and Revelations 21 there's a
[1:50:41] journey taking
[1:50:43] place you say we got the alpha we got
[1:50:46] the Omega the beginning and the end you
[1:50:49] just fill up a portion in
[1:50:51] between you've been a lot of the time on
[1:50:54] this Earth just a portion of time that
[1:50:56] you that you will be right down through
[1:50:58] there and during this journey we see
[1:51:00] that the Earth itself begins to get
[1:51:02] corrupted it begins to get polluted it
[1:51:05] begins to get broken it begins to get uh
[1:51:07] it might say out of kilter we might say
[1:51:10] why because the Earth begins to get
[1:51:12] filled with people and forces that work
[1:51:14] against God's purpose the Bible tells us
[1:51:17] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:51:20] but against principalities Powers rulers
[1:51:22] of the darkness rulers of the
[1:51:25] what the darkness not the light rulers
[1:51:29] of the darkness against spiritual
[1:51:31] wickedness in high
[1:51:33] places so let me take you on a little
[1:51:36] journey this morning the way the prophet
[1:51:38] saw it
[1:51:41] that's the way the prophet saw it he
[1:51:45] said if you notice in the creation the
[1:51:47] first thing that was created was the
[1:51:48] light he said you come down through the
[1:51:51] creation and the last thing that was
[1:51:52] created was what man and he said and
[1:51:56] woman was made after man and the first
[1:51:59] the last or the last thing was created
[1:52:01] was God's creation is
[1:52:03] mankind but when God made his first man
[1:52:07] you notice that he made him in the
[1:52:08] likeness of himself he was in the very
[1:52:10] image of God you see brothers and
[1:52:13] sisters God knew before the foundation
[1:52:15] of the world what he was looking
[1:52:17] for he knew what kind of Warrior it
[1:52:20] would take to survive in this last day
[1:52:23] he knew what kind of mentality you would
[1:52:25] have to have to be an overcomer in this
[1:52:27] last day he knew how strong you would
[1:52:30] have to be to make it to the end of this
[1:52:33] bride
[1:52:35] age he knew what he wanted you and I to
[1:52:38] be like he knew where he wanted you to
[1:52:40] work he knew who he wanted who he wanted
[1:52:43] you to marry he knew where he wanted you
[1:52:46] to live you say well my job my wife and
[1:52:50] my my home ain't nothing like I thought
[1:52:53] it said I said he knew I didn't say you
[1:52:57] followed that's exactly right that's why
[1:52:59] it's so important that we have the Holy
[1:53:01] Ghost when a young man a young woman
[1:53:03] begins to pray for a spouse they better
[1:53:06] have the Holy Ghost because if they
[1:53:08] don't have the Holy Ghost you don't know
[1:53:10] what you're going to get you better have
[1:53:12] a word from God and a and a holy ghost
[1:53:15] experience it says that's your bride
[1:53:17] that's your husband you live here you'll
[1:53:20] work there because you find yourself
[1:53:22] working in a place you don't belong or
[1:53:24] living where you don't belong your life
[1:53:26] will be a living
[1:53:31] hell God's creation is not out of
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:38] order Lord submissive to the Holy
[1:53:42] Ghost God he says created man in his own
[1:53:45] image and his own likeness what kind of
[1:53:47] man did he create a spirit
[1:53:54] man that almost makes you want to
[1:53:57] shout he created a spirit man he said if
[1:54:01] you notice he made all the creation and
[1:54:03] created a spirit man that God could give
[1:54:06] what to
[1:54:08] Dominion thank you Lord Jesus you mean
[1:54:11] all we got to do is be Spirit-filled men
[1:54:13] and God will give us
[1:54:15] Dominion only if you got the
[1:54:18] spirit he can't give you power and
[1:54:20] authority without the Holy Ghost he
[1:54:22] can't trust you with that kind of power
[1:54:25] You' be killing people
[1:54:28] everywhere you would somebody cut you
[1:54:31] off on the
[1:54:32] road kill them Lord kill them take them
[1:54:34] off the
[1:54:36] Earth without the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:54:38] way we act oh you don't believe me he
[1:54:41] said we were Beast without the Holy
[1:54:44] Ghost the man was a beast without the
[1:54:47] Holy Ghost and he said but in making it
[1:54:50] up there he made man in his own image
[1:54:53] just like the Holy Ghost leads the
[1:54:55] spirit believer
[1:54:57] today he made his own image to lead the
[1:55:00] cattle and the Beast of the field he
[1:55:02] said in other words Adam was the first
[1:55:04] man in lower creations of God the first
[1:55:07] creation was God himself then out of God
[1:55:10] came the
[1:55:11] logos you know there's a lot of theories
[1:55:13] there's a lot of things going around and
[1:55:15] a lot of public schools are teaching a
[1:55:17] lot of out there stuff well I got some
[1:55:20] news for you here's the way it
[1:55:23] was I said this is the way it
[1:55:27] was he said out of God came that Loos
[1:55:30] which was the son of God out of that
[1:55:34] Loos was the
[1:55:36] word because in the beginning was the
[1:55:38] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:55:40] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:55:42] and dwelt amongst
[1:55:45] us out of the loost came forth a man now
[1:55:48] listen
[1:55:50] he said' I got a beautiful picture in my
[1:55:51] mind now and I can take a little trip he
[1:55:54] said I want you to take a little trip
[1:55:55] with
[1:55:57] me I believe I've talked on it before
[1:55:59] and he said but I want you to see this
[1:56:02] he said we take a little trip and get
[1:56:04] our minds right he says let's go back a
[1:56:07] hundred million years before there ever
[1:56:10] was a star a moon or anything in the
[1:56:17] world see the prophet couldn't only see
[1:56:19] the
[1:56:20] future
[1:56:23] 100 when there was
[1:56:25] nothing he said but I I I want you to
[1:56:28] get on the banister uh uh the edge of
[1:56:30] the banister with me and look over here
[1:56:31] and see this happened he said there was
[1:56:33] a time when there was nothing here it
[1:56:35] was just forever and Eternity and and it
[1:56:38] was all forever and Eternity was God he
[1:56:41] was there in the beginning he said but
[1:56:44] now notice there's nothing there's just
[1:56:46] space there's no light there's no dark
[1:56:49] there's nothing it just seems nothing
[1:56:51] but in there is a great supernatural
[1:56:54] being Jehovah God and he said right in
[1:56:59] there he says he who's who covered all
[1:57:01] space of all places of all time he was
[1:57:05] the
[1:57:06] Everlasting from Everlasting from
[1:57:12] Everlasting he's the beginning of the
[1:57:14] creation he says that's God you can't
[1:57:18] see nothing you can't hear nothing
[1:57:20] there's not a move of an atom in the air
[1:57:22] not nothing not no air not nothing but
[1:57:25] yet God was there he says that was God
[1:57:29] can you imagine this vast space of
[1:57:32] Eternal
[1:57:35] Bliss quiet everybody just we quiet as
[1:57:38] quiet as you can get right
[1:57:41] now shut your
[1:57:44] eyes
[1:57:47] darkness no air
[1:57:50] no sound no
[1:57:52] light it's just there not a move of an
[1:57:56] Adam in the air not
[1:57:58] nothing he said but now take notice what
[1:58:00] I see in the beginning there was a
[1:58:02] little sacred light begin to
[1:58:04] form and he said it was like a little
[1:58:06] Halo or
[1:58:09] something he said you can only see it by
[1:58:11] your spiritual
[1:58:12] eyes here this little we begin to see
[1:58:15] this Through The Eyes of a supernatural
[1:58:17] looking we see a little white light
[1:58:18] forming out out there he said what was
[1:58:21] that it's the
[1:58:23] logos it's the anointed or the anointing
[1:58:27] he says brothers and sisters that logos
[1:58:29] that little white light was the same
[1:58:31] light that was overshadowed Jesus's life
[1:58:34] it was the same logos the same light
[1:58:36] that was with the children of Israel
[1:58:38] that carried them through the night
[1:58:40] through the desert it was the same light
[1:58:42] that fell on the on the day of Pentecost
[1:58:45] when they come down and spoke in cloven
[1:58:47] tongues it was the same light that
[1:58:49] falling on you
[1:58:52] today 100 million years in the
[1:58:58] making and you were on his
[1:59:06] mind now God gave birth to this son
[1:59:11] himself this son before there was even
[1:59:14] an Adam or heir to make an
[1:59:18] Adam you say I just don't know if I can
[1:59:20] believe
[1:59:24] that got a scripture for
[1:59:27] you John
[1:59:29] 17 John
[1:59:32] 17 Jesus getting ready to go into the
[1:59:34] garden of gethy you look it up and read
[1:59:37] it later but I'll tell you what it says
[1:59:39] Jesus there he speaks and he lifts up
[1:59:41] his eyes to heaven and said father the
[1:59:43] hour is come glorify thy son that thy
[1:59:46] son may be May glorify thee
[1:59:50] thou has given him Power Over All
[1:59:54] Flesh can we say
[1:59:56] Dominion he's given him dominion over
[1:59:58] All Flesh Jesus could control every
[2:00:01] situation in his
[2:00:05] realm that he should give eternal life
[2:00:07] to as many as thou Hast given him and
[2:00:10] this eternal life which they may know to
[2:00:12] be the true only true God and Jesus
[2:00:15] Christ whom thou has sent I have
[2:00:18] glorified thee on Earth
[2:00:20] Jesus speaking I have glorified thee on
[2:00:22] Earth I have finished the work which
[2:00:24] thou has Gest me to do now listen here
[2:00:28] and now oh Father glorify thou me with
[2:00:32] thine own self with the glory which I
[2:00:35] had with thee before the world
[2:00:43] was
[2:00:45] logos is
[2:00:47] spinning a hundred million years
[2:00:50] ago and God said there sets a bride in
[2:00:53] Elton
[2:00:55] Kentucky there's such a group of people
[2:00:58] that's going
[2:00:59] astray I need to send my son
[2:01:02] Jesus
[2:01:04] Loos enter
[2:01:08] [Applause]
[2:01:09] Jesus 100 million
[2:01:13] years
[2:01:15] Jesus con confirming the logos of the
[2:01:18] believer
[2:01:20] and he says God is unfolding himself
[2:01:22] down to human being he said watch what
[2:01:24] he did this little Halo comes we can't
[2:01:27] see nothing yet but by the eyes of
[2:01:28] Supernatural this Halo is standing there
[2:01:31] the Son of God the logos I can see him
[2:01:34] playing as a little child before the
[2:01:36] door of the
[2:01:40] Father
[2:01:42] God the Loos playing as a little child
[2:01:47] before the door father
[2:01:49] father my
[2:01:51] goodness the prophet could see that that
[2:01:55] here's this Robos play he knows each one
[2:01:57] of he knows what we go through from the
[2:01:59] time we're born he has to take on
[2:02:02] humanity and from the very beginning he
[2:02:04] I can see in PL as a child the
[2:02:09] logos and I can hear him say let there
[2:02:12] be light he said when he did the Adam
[2:02:15] burst and the sun came into
[2:02:17] existence and it world for a 100 million
[2:02:23] years so 100 million years of
[2:02:26] Darkness with you on his mind now we've
[2:02:29] got the Sun that just broke into
[2:02:31] existence when he said let there be
[2:02:33] light and he says it's sitting there for
[2:02:35] a 100 million years and it's forming
[2:02:38] clinkers and it's burning and it's
[2:02:40] forming like it is today still still
[2:02:43] breaking
[2:02:44] atoms he's made the
[2:02:47] sun he said and the first thing you know
[2:02:49] a big clinker fell off of it about the
[2:02:53] weight of
[2:02:54] Earth notice notice how he describes
[2:02:58] this about the weight of Earth just
[2:03:00] about like this Earth and it
[2:03:07] went and he said he lets it fall for a
[2:03:09] hundred million years the logos here now
[2:03:13] the Son of God is watching
[2:03:16] this the
[2:03:17] Sun
[2:03:19] the
[2:03:20] earth and the
[2:03:22] logos watching all this he said then
[2:03:25] another one flies off and it flew off
[2:03:28] Falls for millions of
[2:03:30] years then he stops it can you imagine
[2:03:35] as this big ball of Earth comes
[2:03:39] down and he stops IT and pauses it right
[2:03:43] in the middle of his
[2:03:47] universe and he said oh watch this
[2:03:50] little Halo Yonder now he said I can see
[2:03:53] it move out to this earth and get over
[2:03:57] top of it and he be to move it over here
[2:04:01] a little closer to the
[2:04:08] Sun and he said he lays it over there
[2:04:10] closer to the sun because it's nothing
[2:04:12] but a big ball of
[2:04:14] ice so there's for all you flat earthers
[2:04:17] out there that wants to say the Earth is
[2:04:19] flat the prophet said it's a big ball of
[2:04:21] ice ball that's round that's a
[2:04:27] spear it's a big ball of ice and he said
[2:04:31] when it begins to melt these big
[2:04:32] glaciers begin to melt they begin to cut
[2:04:34] through the Northlands and come down and
[2:04:36] when it did it cut out Kansas it cut out
[2:04:38] Texas and it went on down into the Gulf
[2:04:40] of Mexico and the first thing you know
[2:04:42] the whole thing was covered with
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] water and sometimes we think our lives
[2:04:48] are out of of
[2:04:51] control Lord you say brother Brad why
[2:04:54] are you going into such great detail on
[2:04:56] this I'm going into great detail on this
[2:04:58] to show you this morning that God has a
[2:04:59] plan for your life God has a plan for
[2:05:02] this church God has a plan for each and
[2:05:04] every one of us brothers and sisters he
[2:05:06] said this little Halo there it can I can
[2:05:09] see it move down the Earth and over the
[2:05:10] top and it moves over by the Sun and
[2:05:12] Genesis one he said let's get to our
[2:05:14] Bible now the picture of the Bible
[2:05:16] Genesis one the world was without form
[2:05:17] and void and water upon the face of the
[2:05:20] deep and he said he separated the water
[2:05:22] brought up the hills and the lands dried
[2:05:24] it off vegetation and everything he made
[2:05:27] it he made the moon he set the
[2:05:29] boundaries of the sea so it could not
[2:05:32] pass he holds back the
[2:05:35] sea do you realize day after day hour
[2:05:38] after hour 24 hours a day seven days a
[2:05:41] week 365 days a year the ocean stops
[2:05:43] exactly where God says
[2:05:47] stop the river never go no further out
[2:05:50] of the banks than God says stop that's
[2:05:54] right your life cannot be out of control
[2:05:58] because when he gets out of control God
[2:05:59] will look at you and say
[2:06:01] stop come to your
[2:06:08] senses brothers and sisters young person
[2:06:10] listen God had you in his mind when all
[2:06:12] his creation was formed he was thinking
[2:06:14] of you he saw you as a child Paul he saw
[2:06:18] you growing up he saw the very fears
[2:06:20] that you would have as a little boy
[2:06:22] growing up and he's aware of all these
[2:06:24] he knows the Temptations we have in our
[2:06:26] life and in our
[2:06:32] mind this
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:36] journey you know the amazing thing about
[2:06:38] it is in this journey God will lose not
[2:06:40] a single
[2:06:43] one when the children of Israel left
[2:06:45] there was not one hoof left behind so no
[2:06:48] matter how big your Mountain how wide
[2:06:50] your Valley how deep your River God will
[2:06:53] never lose a one you said I can't get
[2:06:57] over
[2:06:58] this you'll never lose in
[2:07:06] Christ but there was no man to teal the
[2:07:09] soul and he said God formed a Man Out of
[2:07:13] the Dust of the Earth can you imagine
[2:07:15] God stepping down there and pulling up a
[2:07:17] big old big mound of
[2:07:20] clay and the prophet said I can see him
[2:07:22] there and and put his Supernatural
[2:07:24] spirit in him he said I can see he was
[2:07:26] laying there I can see Adam standing
[2:07:28] there like a
[2:07:30] tree my favorite quote one of my
[2:07:33] favorite all times I can remember 25 30
[2:07:36] years ago when brother Donnie preached
[2:07:37] that years ago at Dyersburg I think it
[2:07:40] was but he said they stood like a tree
[2:07:45] God had made him and he was dead as he
[2:07:47] could be and his toes were like Roots
[2:07:49] into the
[2:07:50] ground so here is Adam standing there
[2:07:53] now dead as could
[2:07:55] be and he said he's sticking there in
[2:07:57] the ground and
[2:08:00] God
[2:08:02] breathed yes what did he breathe into
[2:08:05] him he bre breathed the breath of life
[2:08:08] into Adam and he said Adam jumped and he
[2:08:12] came to himself and he began to move on
[2:08:15] and he said he began to move on and he
[2:08:17] began to move on brothers and sisters
[2:08:19] when God puts the spirit of life into
[2:08:21] you you can't sit still no more you have
[2:08:25] a work to do Adam when God breathed into
[2:08:29] him he went on and on and on because he
[2:08:31] had a work to do for God he had to tend
[2:08:35] to the
[2:08:37] Garden young people you got a work to
[2:08:42] do Church we've got a work to
[2:08:45] do we got a work to do for our young
[2:08:47] people can I say it that
[2:08:50] way our young people need
[2:08:53] us they need us more today than any
[2:08:55] young persons ever needed a holy ghost
[2:08:57] filled
[2:08:59] [Applause]
[2:09:00] Church you think you got Temptations
[2:09:03] when you were young you don't have a
[2:09:05] clue these young people go through more
[2:09:08] than we can ever
[2:09:09] imagine they have more Temptation more
[2:09:12] more internet more more at the
[2:09:14] fingertips than than than you can even
[2:09:16] shake a stick at
[2:09:18] it used to be that you had to fight to
[2:09:20] go get into trouble you had to work to
[2:09:22] go get into trouble no it ain't that way
[2:09:30] anymore brothers and sisters that Breath
[2:09:32] of Life came into
[2:09:36] Adam and Adam became everything at that
[2:09:41] moment that God ever wanted him to
[2:09:46] be not 100 million but for hundreds of
[2:09:50] millions of years in the
[2:09:52] making and he breathed into him and Adam
[2:09:56] was now in full control over the Garden
[2:09:59] of Eden Adam now has full dominion over
[2:10:03] his life no evil could control him he
[2:10:06] had no evil thoughts he had no fear he
[2:10:09] had no hatred he had no malice he had no
[2:10:12] jealousy he had no doubts about anything
[2:10:15] brothers and sisters none of that
[2:10:16] existed in his life why because his life
[2:10:18] was holy filled with the Holy Ghost of
[2:10:22] God as long as that spirit dwelt in
[2:10:28] there and there there was sitting back
[2:10:31] there he said in time and he said I can
[2:10:33] see eeve and all of her beauty there you
[2:10:37] see Adam was now in a
[2:10:41] domain he controlled it
[2:10:44] all how many of us would like to say
[2:10:46] Lord I'd like to have control holy ho
[2:10:48] ghost control of my
[2:10:50] life that's why we need the Holy Spirit
[2:10:53] and Adam now in complete control and he
[2:10:56] said there I could see Eve and her
[2:10:57] beauty and and they sat there and they
[2:10:59] didn't know what sin
[2:11:01] was one place the prophet said she was
[2:11:04] the perfect built woman he says she was
[2:11:08] the most beautiful woman that God ever
[2:11:11] put on the face of the
[2:11:14] Earth her blue eyes sparkling like the
[2:11:18] Blue Sky her long hair down her
[2:11:21] back sitting there in their innocence
[2:11:24] and they would look out there and he
[2:11:26] said Adam was there he was touching her
[2:11:29] flesh can you imagine Adam caressing Eve
[2:11:32] and touching her flesh and saying your
[2:11:34] Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone
[2:11:37] can you imagine how God how he wants to
[2:11:39] look down at his bride and he looks down
[2:11:40] his bride when you're filled with the
[2:11:41] Holy Ghost and he says you are Flesh of
[2:11:43] My Flesh and bone of my bone
[2:11:47] Lord
[2:11:50] he said they go walking arm and arm down
[2:11:52] through the garden and the winds
[2:11:56] blow and she says oh dear that wind and
[2:12:00] he said Adam said
[2:12:07] Peace and the wind
[2:12:11] stopped you talking about having a
[2:12:13] domain you talking about ruling a
[2:12:16] kingdom and he said the wind and he said
[2:12:18] they were just sitting there and she
[2:12:19] said no Adam you know how women
[2:12:22] are it was the same in the
[2:12:25] garden now if this tree was just sitting
[2:12:28] over here wouldn't it look much
[2:12:32] prettier you got it
[2:12:35] dear right where you want
[2:12:39] [Music]
[2:12:42] it ruling a
[2:12:45] domain are you with me amen
[2:12:49] and he said oh he plucked it up and
[2:12:51] placed it there so brothers and sisters
[2:12:53] the second Adam proved that it could be
[2:12:55] done it proved that it could be done he
[2:12:58] controlled all of nature Adam controlled
[2:13:00] all of nature the second Adam controlled
[2:13:01] all of nature it was given into his
[2:13:04] hands just like it was with Jesus Christ
[2:13:08] when Jesus Christ was here the storm was
[2:13:10] raging the boat was being tossed and he
[2:13:12] goes up and he puts his foot up on the
[2:13:13] bow and what does he say peace be still
[2:13:20] what did Adam do for Eve peace be still
[2:13:24] you say well that's in the garden that's
[2:13:26] that's back when Jesus was here well
[2:13:27] remember Brandon was lost up in the
[2:13:29] wilderness and the storm was
[2:13:31] raging what did he say storm move
[2:13:36] back you say well that stuff is all good
[2:13:39] and fine but what about
[2:13:42] me same thing that's right brother same
[2:13:45] thing we have to get to a place that we
[2:13:48] realize what God is doing in our lives
[2:13:50] that God is concerned about every single
[2:13:52] portion in your life I'll give you a
[2:13:55] little testimony I've only shared it
[2:13:56] with one other person I wasn't
[2:13:57] explaining to share it
[2:13:59] today but I just failed to put it in
[2:14:03] here Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:14:05] today and forever how many believe
[2:14:08] that there was a hunting trip where
[2:14:10] squirrels were spoken into existence you
[2:14:13] believe
[2:14:15] that there are times when things had to
[2:14:18] happen when eyes were formed and placed
[2:14:20] into the
[2:14:23] sockets this this last weekend in
[2:14:25] Arizona I met my first person that I
[2:14:27] know of that was healed in the
[2:14:30] meetings she was a little girl just a
[2:14:33] baby and her mama took her to the took
[2:14:35] her to the meetings brother Brandon was
[2:14:37] there and she had a huge a huge birth
[2:14:39] mark on the side of her face one of
[2:14:41] those I can't what are they
[2:14:43] called well we call them strawberries
[2:14:45] but there's a medical name out of
[2:14:48] nursing too long but a big old red
[2:14:51] maroon burgundy puffy spot on her face
[2:14:55] and
[2:14:59] neck and she just took her took her to
[2:15:02] brother Bram said would you pray that
[2:15:04] this would
[2:15:05] leave sister Robin I know brother Troy
[2:15:08] know her brother brother Josiah's wife
[2:15:12] brother Josiah Scott's
[2:15:16] wife he said the prophet
[2:15:18] prayed they took her home it didn't fall
[2:15:22] off
[2:15:22] immediately but over the next couple of
[2:15:25] days it began to change
[2:15:27] colors and it began to change shape and
[2:15:30] it began to change colors in so much
[2:15:32] that the mother almost thought about
[2:15:33] taking her to the doctor and say is this
[2:15:35] okay that she left there she stayed
[2:15:38] there and she began to hold on to what
[2:15:39] God had done in her
[2:15:41] life today there is no spot not a
[2:15:45] wrinkle not a blemish not a crevice
[2:15:48] not a not not a not a not an image of
[2:15:50] anything on her neck you say well that
[2:15:54] too is brother brand I'm met that person
[2:15:56] so I know it happened I saw the picture
[2:15:58] of her when she was a baby she showed it
[2:15:59] to me I saw the finished work of God so
[2:16:03] God can create God can heal sickness God
[2:16:06] can do all that and I say all this to
[2:16:08] tell you this testimony and you can say
[2:16:11] well you just getting super spiritual
[2:16:13] maybe I am maybe I need more spiritual
[2:16:16] maybe we all need more
[2:16:20] spiritual butin and I were hunting
[2:16:23] couple days well a couple weeks
[2:16:26] ago I was in my stand he was in his
[2:16:29] stand terrible day kind of like I said
[2:16:31] earlier it's a horrible
[2:16:33] trip it's a horrible hunting
[2:16:36] trip cold nothing moving not even a
[2:16:39] squirrel
[2:16:41] barking and I'm sitting in my stand he's
[2:16:43] down in the bottom in his
[2:16:46] stand and and I'm sitting there and all
[2:16:48] of a sudden I'm looking over here and
[2:16:49] all of a sudden I look back and there's
[2:16:50] two two do standing in front of
[2:16:52] me and I thought where in the world did
[2:16:55] they come
[2:16:56] from let me tell you when I say dead I
[2:16:59] mean it was dead out there these two do
[2:17:03] standing out in front of me and they
[2:17:04] begin to walk
[2:17:05] across just just just heading way to the
[2:17:08] other other Farm other side of the farm
[2:17:10] and all a sudden they both just stop and
[2:17:12] they turn and they begin to go the other
[2:17:14] way I thought what is crazy things doing
[2:17:18] deer don't do that deer don't do that
[2:17:21] when they pick a path they begin to go
[2:17:22] and they just keep on Sayer and on out
[2:17:24] of your sight generally right if you
[2:17:27] hunt you know what I'm talking about
[2:17:28] they turn and they begin to go down and
[2:17:30] they go right off into the bottom where
[2:17:32] Weston's
[2:17:34] at now let me tell you I didn't think a
[2:17:36] thing about
[2:17:38] it couple an hour later he says it was
[2:17:41] time to go he says I shot a
[2:17:44] d I said okay I go down there
[2:17:48] he said it was two of them Dad I said
[2:17:52] okay so we go looking and I I've always
[2:17:56] taught my boys when we when we shoot
[2:17:58] anything we always pray and we thank the
[2:18:00] Lord for it and give give praise for
[2:18:02] what God's done for us and a good
[2:18:03] successful hunt and so I just told Wes I
[2:18:06] said well praise the Lord he said well
[2:18:08] he sent me just what I asked for
[2:18:13] oh you talking
[2:18:16] about a chill hitting
[2:18:19] me I'm not talking about because it cold
[2:18:23] outside but I'm talking about I just
[2:18:25] watched two deer that wasn't standing in
[2:18:27] front of me two seconds before I turned
[2:18:29] my head and they're standing in the
[2:18:30] middle of the field and they begin to
[2:18:32] Walk This Way turn and they walk right
[2:18:33] down to him and he said God give me
[2:18:35] exactly what I asked
[2:18:44] for you say well they were in the woods
[2:18:46] all the time maybe they were maybe they
[2:18:56] weren't Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:18:58] today and
[2:19:01] [Applause]
[2:19:03] forever thank
[2:19:05] you he said because when Adam redeemed
[2:19:10] himself back to God the way he should be
[2:19:12] and have faith in God he will do it
[2:19:15] again too cuz it lays in hand Christ was
[2:19:18] that link that linked man
[2:19:22] together he said but then when sin came
[2:19:26] in as soon as they realized they had
[2:19:29] sinned it separated themselves from
[2:19:33] God he said they went in behind there
[2:19:35] and they had fig leaves on to make
[2:19:37] aprons and they realized that fig Leaf
[2:19:39] religion didn't work when it comes to
[2:19:41] meeting
[2:19:42] God no brothers and sisters things had
[2:19:45] changed now the garden f feels different
[2:19:48] now things were no longer in control
[2:19:51] their lives were now beginning to get
[2:19:52] into a place of chaos without the Holy
[2:19:55] Ghost without the spirit of God in
[2:20:00] there so now God is running through the
[2:20:03] garden and he's crying out Adam Adam
[2:20:06] where are
[2:20:07] thou where are they
[2:20:11] Adam and Adam made himself an apron and
[2:20:14] stood before
[2:20:16] him and and in order for God to get to
[2:20:19] Adam back to himself again so he could
[2:20:21] talk to him those fig leaves wasn't good
[2:20:26] enough God said something's got to
[2:20:29] die and God goes out and into the
[2:20:32] innocence of the Garden of Eden and
[2:20:34] grabs a
[2:20:36] lamb and God kills that lamb and skins
[2:20:40] it pulls the very hide off of it and
[2:20:44] throws it to Adam and Eve and says put
[2:20:46] this on
[2:20:53] can you
[2:20:55] imagine can you imagine the emptiness
[2:20:58] that Adam must have
[2:20:59] felt when God looked at him and said get
[2:21:02] out of the
[2:21:05] garden
[2:21:09] leave you no longer have a
[2:21:16] domain
[2:21:20] can you imagine when Adam steps across
[2:21:23] that threshold of the garden for the
[2:21:26] first time or the only time I should
[2:21:29] say and he steps across that threshold
[2:21:32] and fear hits him for the first time in
[2:21:34] his
[2:21:35] life an emotion a feeling he's never
[2:21:38] felt before and a fear begins to come
[2:21:40] upon him and it creates an anxiety and a
[2:21:44] panic in his life and he begins to look
[2:21:46] around maybe maybe even begins to say
[2:21:49] Eve
[2:21:51] Eve what have you
[2:21:53] done and maybe a little bit of anger and
[2:21:56] disappointment that he's never felt
[2:22:00] before as he looks at
[2:22:02] Eve why have you why have we gotten into
[2:22:05] this place that's exactly right let me
[2:22:08] ask you church with God being so good to
[2:22:10] us God freely given all that he is day
[2:22:12] after day why do we get oursel in a
[2:22:14] place right exactly right what is better
[2:22:17] than God what is better than being full
[2:22:20] of the Holy Ghost what is better than
[2:22:22] living for Christ what is better than
[2:22:24] living for
[2:22:26] others thank you Lord and fear begins to
[2:22:30] take him over the lion that once walked
[2:22:33] by his side now
[2:22:38] snars the lion that once ate vegetation
[2:22:41] now has
[2:22:43] fangs and Adam now looks like a meal
[2:22:48] huh things change quick don't it things
[2:22:51] can change real quick without the holy
[2:22:53] ghost things that didn't used to bother
[2:22:56] you they begin to grow
[2:22:57] fangs and Satan begins to
[2:23:01] snarl when you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:23:03] that's right that's exactly but I'm
[2:23:07] thankful this morning brothers and
[2:23:08] sisters that there is a way back to
[2:23:11] God's domain this morning there's a way
[2:23:13] back to God's domain this morning that
[2:23:15] our lives can be in order that we can
[2:23:18] have forgiveness through the blood of
[2:23:20] Jesus Christ not through some bloody
[2:23:22] lambskins but through the actual blood
[2:23:24] that was shed on Calvary because of that
[2:23:27] blood we are called Sons and Daughters
[2:23:30] of God and as Sons and Daughters of God
[2:23:33] there is an adoption that takes place
[2:23:36] there is an adoption that takes place in
[2:23:38] your life and the prophet said when
[2:23:40] there's an adoption you're adopted it
[2:23:43] can't be changed when God adopts you
[2:23:46] you're right there you you been put into
[2:23:47] the body correctly in other words now
[2:23:51] you're in the family Lord now you're in
[2:23:54] the family of God and all that God is
[2:23:57] and all that God was and all that he
[2:24:00] poured into Christ is now poured into
[2:24:02] the church through the adoption of Jesus
[2:24:05] Christ and he says that Spirit OB bear
[2:24:08] Spirit within oursel that spirit will
[2:24:11] bear a witness of our spirit in other
[2:24:14] words there's a deep calling to the deep
[2:24:16] and our spirit on the inside God
[2:24:18] recognizes that spirit and he says my
[2:24:21] spirit and your spirit must come
[2:24:23] together and now you've got
[2:24:26] domain now you rule Satan now you've got
