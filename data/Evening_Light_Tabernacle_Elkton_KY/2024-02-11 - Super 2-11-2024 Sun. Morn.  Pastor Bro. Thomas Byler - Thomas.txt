still in recovery but uh thankful that he's able to be with us brother Brian would you open us in prayer this morning youate service Lord amen turn with me if you would to the Book of Psalms we'll read 149 this morning Psalms 149 it reads praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of [Applause] saints let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing

execute upon them the Judgment written this honor Have All Saints praise ye the Lord Brother Troy the children can be dismissed for Sunday School good morning brothers and sisters fancy new pull pit up here that's really nice let's see if we'll just uh you can be seated we're just going to go in the scriptures this thought came we were at a church down in Sarasota last weekend and he was preaching on this uh but was on Abraham and Sarah and it was on God uh finding a need in his people and uh it's a little let's see here you you go with me if you want to the revelations let's see pull this Revelations 3 and we'll do uh star in verse 14 this is a familiar scripture to us and this is where we are in the church and unto the angel of the Church of the Lans write these things sayith amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked counsel the to by me gold tried in the fire thou mayest be rich in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint th eyes with isaf that thou mayest see and he goes on to tell them as I as many as I love are rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will St with him and he with me to him that overcometh will overcame and him sit down with my father and his throne that he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and just speaking this is where we are speaking of where we are in the world today we're uh in a world that doesn't really have many needs they do have needs they don't just know they have needs but they're rich they're increased with knowledge they have say I think it was this morning he was saying how uh when they went to uh build the Tabernacle there that uh I I forget exactly how he said he said maybe they they uh between all of them at the church there they might had I think he said maybe 30 cents but the Lord helped them build that Tabernacle but it's just a day and age that's increased with everything and uh and that's kind of the human nature being increased with everything everyone wants to be self-sufficient uh everyone you know is a a a self-made person or a self-made man not dependent on anyone or anything not dependent on God and uh that's a scary place especially spiritual to be uh you know be careful when things are that way or that easy because then one finds self not calling on God or not depending on God not calling after to him or not having any needs and Moses spoke of it there in Deuteronomy and uh oh it's Deuteronomy 6 I'll just read it here in verse 10 and it he said and it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee in the land which he swear unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not and houses full of all good things which thou fillest not and Wells digged which thou dig digest not Vineyards and olive trees which thou planted not when thou shalt have eaten and be full he said then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and um living in that day and age is totally opposite of what God you know I guess intended for humans uh this lady oan age back in Genesis 15 he goes to Abraham and it just stood out to me so much when the brother there had brought it out uh it's in Genesis 15 and we'll go there if you want to go there you can if not I'll just read it to you after this it's Genesis 15 after this the word of the Lord came to Abraham in Aion do not be afraid Abraham I'm your Shield your very great reward and Abraham said Sovereign Lord what can you give me since I remain childless the one who inherit my estate is elazer of Damascus and Abraham said and Abram said you have given me no children so a servant in my household would be my Heir then the Lord word of the Lord came to him this man will not be the your Heir but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your Heir and he took him outside and said look up at the sky and count the Stars if indeed you can count them he said unto him so shall your Offspring be Abram believed the Lord and He credited it to him as righteousness he also said to him I am the Lord who brought you out of the her of the Chans to give you this land and take possession of it abam said Sovereign Lord how can I know that this that I will gain possession of this so the Lord said to him bring me a heer a goat a ram each three years old along with a dove and a young pigeon abam brought all these things all these to him cut them into and arranged in halves opposite of each other the birds however he did not cut in half and the birds in the prey came down on the carcasses but Abraham drove them away and as the sun was setting Abraham fell into a deep sleep and a thick Dreadful Darkness came up over him and the Lord said unto him know for certain that for 400 years your descendants would be strangers in the country of Their Own not their own and that they will be enslaved Mis slaved and mistreated there but I will punish the nation they they serve as slaves and afterward they would come out with a great possession and uh let's see skip down here just a little bit when the sun had set and darkness had fallen a smoking fire pot with blazing torch appeared and pass between the pieces on that day the Lord made Covenant with Abraham said to your descendants I give this land from the from the K but uh of this of Egypt to the Great River of Euphrates and uh brother Brenham said let's see if I can find it here brother Brenham was saying here about Abraham talking about Abraham had a need of of a Heir and uh let's see here well notice he said what he did oh it's marvelous he kept the birds off of it so Abraham's job was to keep the birds off it it wasn't to change it wasn't to change what God told him to bring it wasn't to do things differently than what God told him but it was to keep the the vultures away from what he had laid out for the sacrifice he said you keep the birds off until the sun went down notice then a deep sleep fell on Abraham first thing brother Bram says Abraham Abraham I'm just going to shut you off to show you there's not one thing you can do about it this is my Covenant and it wasn't one thing brother that you could do about it it isn't one thing sister that you done about it it's what God did for you in Christ not because you was good not because a a mother was good but what Christ was good and what Christ did by calling you put him then he says he put him to sleep now he hasn't got anything to do with it so after he went to sleep then there come down a real deep horrible Darkness what did that mean he said brother said hell separation every sinner deserves it separation and then beyond that was a burning furnace death separation hell after that I think I'm but then beyond that there went a little white light I hope you never disbelieve no more from this hour Abraham asleep and in a vision showing that every man must come in this horrible darkness of Separation death that every man deserves to go to hell because he's a sinner he fell he's The Offspring of a sinner and then beyond that went a little white light in other words the same pillar of power that followed Israel the same Holy Spirit that's here today and it went right in between each one of those sacrifices God confirming by his grace some someday that he would do what he would do in Jesus Christ now to the oath God took an oath over it and he took an oath tonight swore by himself that none other greater to swear by he swore by himself he'd keep his word amen he he will keep his promise he didn't only say it but he swore to it he'd do it what are you trying to do brother Brenham brother bam says get you to a place where you can see what God has done for you that's why these things take place God has promised to do them he's got to do them in order to be God he's got to keep his promises and uh let's see but uh what it is is we live in a self-sufficient age where everybody doesn't have need to nothing or but but you know as a as a Believer as the Church of the Living God we have needs and we have needs amongst the people this morning I'm sure I their sickness some need healing in their bodies some need healing maybe in uh Financial situations or decisions I know I need I have many needs seems like all the time with needs but uh but that's what God's looking for you know as human as human uh nature is we we'd pick the biggest and the best person to do the job if if you're look going for a job interview or something they're going to pick you on your credentials maybe if you went to school at a certain certain place or this or that smarts or if you're looking for a basketball team or the children are you know going to play basketball they're going to look for the person that's best in basketball that maybe the tallest or maybe the strongest that's not what God's looking for God uh showed it when he picked David uh Samuel went down there to anoint a king and he had all the brothers out there you know all the strong strapping boys maybe military even did some military time already all them out there lined up to be anointed king and Samuel said he God said he's not even they said he's not even here he's still still out on the back hill there with the Sheep they didn't even bother to go get him to be anointed king but God doesn't look on the outside God looks on the inside of man and that stood out to me so much because that's what we need that's what I need you know we always think well we got to be this or we got to be that you ain't got to be nothing you have to be an a person that is in need for God to meet your need then you have to latch on to the promise of what God gave his word and never let it go with Abraham he was promised a child and Heir and and uh Sarah and Hagar gotten you know together and they they came up with the idea to have Hagar go into him and she did conceive and she produced uh ishol a wild man never to Be Tamed and that's what happens a lot of times with us when we have a promise we we might have some of our own ideas in there or some of our own ideas or we some a lot of times get impatient that's not what we we're supposed to do not getting patient we're supposed to believe if we're Believers we believe and we hang on to the promises of God and he'll bring you through to the other side we don't have to have it all figured out because a lot of times in our own carnal thinking we can't figure it out but if we just stick with his word and in his word he'll bring us through to the other side uh brother Josh Stand this morning man you ready to Worship

for our morning service so everybody amen that wants to hear Brother Dar I'll be sure to be here amen and pray for him that he will amen God will just use him as he always does amen and I think there's some activities for the Young Folks Amen on Saturday so I'm sure yall know about that amen okay Isaiah 7 and we'll begin with um verse 10 moreover the Lord spake again unto Ahab saying ask the a sign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above and ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and he said hear ye now oh House of David it is it a small thing

page over from my Bible in chapter N9 and verse 6 we'll read a couple verses There For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counsel counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning you know I was just praying in my just really couldn't find anything to minister on I was just waiting and sometimes I'll just study or I'll read and just pray and then amen and and and I begin to think about I guess today it's supposed to be the Super Bowl right amen I think brother Joe mentioned it you know and it's the the highlight of football amen and it's called the Super Bowl a that right and I got to thinking about that a little bit talk a lot about that word super amen Super Bowl you know I man my mind just got to going and the God be anointed so I just went down that road and amen so this morning we're just going to call it call this message this morning super would that be all right we're going to call this message this morning with the help of the Lord amen super because it's uh if you'll notice and I I I know that brother Brandon many times he could take a a ball game he could take just about anything in natural and type type the natural with the spiritual is that right amen and we know that in this super bow that amen this is the uh highlight of it all this is the U what what you the climax isn't that right the grand finale amen and you know in order to for them to have gotten here they had to fight a lot of battles they had to play a lot of games they had a lot of adversity amen and amen and we know that to be in this amen you know and I thought about Luther Luther maybe Luther and Wesley's time being like the regular season you know and it ain't you know some sometimes teams go to whole season and never win one game right you know maybe one or two wins and boy that's that's just they don't teams like that don't make the playoffs isin that right so it's the first stage is the the battle for the playoffs you know and and only so many will make it it into that playoffs and so forth and the next phase maybe you know it's finally we get into the playoffs isn't that right and then we maybe Ty back with Pentecost amen they were in the playoffs and in there amen they eliminate anybody that is inferior in any way if you have a bad day you're going to be out amen and so they get rid of the weaker ones and of course you know with Luther like brother bam said you know he still drank a little he smoked a little they was far from Perfection isn't that right they're far from Perfection and next you know in the order to be in that that the playoffs you got to be a little bit better and you got to be in the a little bit higher class and so forth you know but if you can make a I don't know how many times you'll have to play but you know it's in that final four games that it's really really gets little stressed out and tense you know when there's four teams playing it's coming down to four now and then it'll go down to two and and they battle it out right amen we can say that playoffs down to the very nitty gritt came right up close to it amen and we know Pentecost was RA just about like it I mean it looked like the church it looked like Christ it was looking like the original Church am man it was about as good a football team as they going to be a that right but you know but you know know they that they fought it out and now the ones that win that the last final two amen and now they go into the Super Bowl they considered the very best of the very best amen and how many believe that that's God is saving I believe he's saving the best for last amen you might not think much of yourself but God chose you God chose me Amen to fight devil in this hour to come against our adversary amen and we're going to have a absolute Showdown as the prophet of God said anden there's a mount show down there with transfigure uh figuration Showdown there with Jesus and but said there's a Mount Zion Showdown coming for you and I we're in a showdown time we're in the Final Phase of it we're in the final final act so to speak amen and he saves the best of the best amen you're GNA have to be good you're gonna have to be real good amen that's right you think about those players you think about those wide receivers what was that song Going those wide receivers to break away hello or you think about one of those running backs maybe on a on they're going all the way they get you just to get to church morning devil tries to keep you away from church oh I got a two I got oh you just got tackled I can't go this morning with this out of the amen I'm telling you what you got tackled will got you down if he can keep you out of the house of God he will man he'll have your baby spit all over you he'll have your tire go flat he'll have something this that or there let go my leg I'm I'm going hard hello contrary to the word of God you gotta overcome a whole lot and that's what today is in the natural world it's about overcoming the adversary and I want you to know it's got climactic time for the Church of the Living God Amen to overcome our adversary amen if God has set you free you are free [Music] indeed how many believe that there nothing like amen amen some some preachers don't even believe in Reading quotes I believe in Reading quotes listen don't repeat quotes but not not read them listen are you ready for a good one listen he was talking about the law of reproduction whenever brother B was anointed to pick up his pen and write and write this whole big letter and in that letter he says uh whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed start at the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed oh my I was a good teacher how many knows there's different seeds that were sewn Pentecostal seed denominational seed and bride seed were sown we already know what some of the other SE is producing homosexuals in the church and preachers and everything else and even the pope himself you know condoning that same seex bunch of mess yeah that's it's going to bring forth of his own kind it's going to be a bunch of hateful unclean words but I'm telling you what how many know that this word that you got in form in word form amen it's going to produce a pride oh I got to thinking about it it isn't about what I do or what you do it's about what God does in us and God is doing something and I'm glad of what he's doing and if he a doing it I don't want to I don't do nothing if he ain't doing it he's doing it he has sown a seed huh the word just comes back listen he says from henceforth even forever the Seal of the Lord of hosts will perform this how many know it's what he is performing in these last days the true the super [Applause] church amen she will be the Super Church praise the Lord a super race oh my just two a amen the Pentecostal said he was so good that Li their lips I'm I'm start that in your pipe and smoke it or something like that we going to say put back your mouth and chew it as she nears him chew that for a while how many believes that that's what's going on brother Troy how many knows we're nearing him we're getting closer to him all the time if you're not in Christ you're where you don't care about God Church the message and man you got all kinds of negativity and all you see wrong around the message and this that the that's all you can see you need to get your binders on to all the negative get your eyes set on Christ amen cuz the bride is getting nearer we're getting closer it Ain just because all of a sudden better the preachers are getting to be preachers it's not because of all of that it's because God is doing something not just in the preachers but in the congregation and in people's lives God's doing something we're getting closer to it just like in the football game I'm telling you what they got to perfect Every Act they got to perfect every play and they've got to be better than the other guy let me tell you something if you're going to be an over come you going to have to be better than the old devil you're going to have to be better than your adversary the mount carel the Rapture is going to prove who is and who's not as a showdown coming there's going to be the thrill of victory that's what I'm interested in brother Tommy I'm interested in the thrill of victory can you hear it over there W I can hear it when we see our loved ones I can hear

halfway clean have power no it's not the age of do that was man this is the age let me tell you something every footstep that they make every move that they make it be premeditated it's going to say I got to do this the devil has thrown everything at us that he can every trick in the book every trap there is is laid out there huh if he knows you're a great big old 300 pounder and you can't hardly go down all he's going to do is go for your ankles and your feet and trip you he'll figure something out to try to get to you he knows you better than you know yourself probably and you need the power of the Holy Ghost I manyan know the only super the only thing that makes super is the super Holy [Applause] Ghost oh my it's super natural there it is amen supern a super race as she nears him they wait before I read that I want to read you a scripture for whom he did for know Romans 8:29 he also did predit of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren in other words he's not the only one that should be able to walk on water is still be able to walk on water he wants to be the firstborn of many Brethren oh if you a Christian at all there's one thing that's in your heart that's a burning desire and that's to be more like him if you ain't got that in your life and you ain't predestinated because you're predestinated to be in the image of his son it's in your genetics to want to be a better Christian amen M that's right the first B born among many Brethren they and the bride will be so much like him that they will be in his very image there's a b question mark people look at you can they see Jesus do they see Jesus that is a real Christian [Music] amen it's a longing in our heart to be like him Jezebels out put people that are in of man out people that have rejected manifested Vindicated message of this hour for their own Super man-made ways there going to be a lot of people left outside they're not anywhere close to the image of Jesus to be United with them they the father father to me I you aren't you glad that you can think like Christ you can have the mind of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce it because they're the wrong seed they will produce mixed with the word amen and all right brother B says this is a day of super everything has to be super how many knows oh my if it isn't the super product then it won't this is else you know and all that other good stuff oh man it's so super everything's so super super car super trucks super this super that Supermarket Super Walmarts amen everything and we remember that because that human being God knowing their nature and something in man that no matter how far he has fallen yet by Design he's the son of God design that God designed him in his own fashion many times I go down to Miami Florida Fort Lauderdale Florida and those people down there take better care of their backyard and cutting their grass and I do my hair that I got left feather feather edge some man just keep every little blade of grass all right out of the way beautiful structures Mammoth paintings and beautifully cost thousands of dollars the palm trees with a line of neon lights around it the flood lights at night time to reflect the glows of rainbow and beautiful lights with yachts in the backyard coming up through the canal from the main peninsula of water coming in oh my what does that because inside of man he is an amateur created amateur cre he cannot create but he can take something that already has been created and almost take another creation out of it it's his intellect intelligence his intellects amen I didn't take time but how many remember brother B talking about what makes man do the things that they do aren't you glad that we have a book that tells you every emotion every feeling and everything that people do we know why people do what they do why do people do to sin why oh myal man that's what the natural man does he likes every blade of grass just in the right place he wants Neon Lights he want things beautiful why do we we like it beautiful we want it perfect we want our yards perfect why because there's something on the inside tell us that we have followed from Perfection and we desire to have that Perfection man oh man where would this world be if we would try to make our hearts as perfect as why we do our natural thing our job has has to be perfect our oh my our business has to be perfect everybody got to be on there on time everything has to be done so and so on everything has to be perfect if we wouldn't do that with our hearts and our lives we'd be the happiest people in the world we'd be the great conquerors the devil wouldn't sign the tracks we'd be like some of them running backs in the time past nothing could stop them they just keep right on running amen we've seen some of them in history of how they do amen praise be to God would be to God that we are showing well it just comes to me now I didn't even realize it didn't

and all that stuff amen how many knows thank God for Freedom thank God for Freedom my how I got that just from this year God made us to be an amateur Creator he made us desire Perfection huh how many desires Perfection and I just remember something I wrote down it says if you desire Perfection then you are to love church you ought to love the fivefold ministry cuz God said that he gave the fivefold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith to the Statue of the fullness of Christ until we're a football player like we ought to be the kind of player the kind of [Music] warrior yeah brother Luke thought come in there ain't supposed to be there get the behind me Satan any thought that comes into your mind ain't supposed to be that Paul said casting down reason imagination and every thought that is contrary to the word of God take it captive and lock it in prison to get out of here don't you ever bother me again and he'll flee from you after why you don't even think those thoughts anymore [Music] nobody good it's because of the inside thirst after him want you to be a Superman Brother David said how many here wants to walk on water now this just comes to me draw now I didn't even pretend on saying this but let me ask you this how many wants to be Superman and Superwoman that's right brother Braham said this sign that he was given was a super sign a sign that a lost last for all time it was a super sign I'll give you a sign a virgin shall conceive that'll be your super sign you want something super look at the birth of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord two things I really want to get across yet one of them is the part of the natural man the other part is going to be how to become a Superman a Superman amen okay the animals they don't never change Fox still does everything the same but man don't does he man don't no he's always trying to make things better always trying to make great things when are they going to stop when is Russia going to stop trying to beat America America stop trying to beat Russia China be trying to become a superpower North Korea try to be a superpower of some kind trying to outdo somebody else by their own achievements they want to be better than somebody else they want to be greater than somebody else they want to be great in some manner or other man always wants to be great amen amen in the religious Realms people want to follow somebody great they want a great preacher wow they want a great church they want a great great great this that or the other and God wants you to have great things he wants you to be great but you got to go about it the right way how many believe it you got to go about it the right way brother bam says Adam begin it in the Garden of Eden he wanted a super religion and everything is super super it only means that we're going into dark chaos with these super things amen talking about guns and so forth uh you know how they always try to outdo somebody else listen he NE he never wants to take God's way about it he wants to achieve something for himself Adam had a super religion how many knows what it was a fig Leaf religion that's right he had a religion that made he had made himself trying to have a super religion without an atonement for sin man's got the same thing trying to do it today have a religion without an atonement you've got that atonement how many believe you got to have a religion that takes care of your sin but they want to be in their sin and still have church they want to be homosexuals and still be in church they want to be this out and the other still be Church manmade religions manmade great things will never never go nowhere amen my have a religion without an atonement Amen Let Me Go on super churches looking for super things our own beloved country here as we came from England which was called the queen of the sea in the day England claimed to be the queen of the sea and she still calls her Queen of the sea and we wanted to beat them so we build a super ship we achieve something and be build a great big ship of out of our scientists our great intellectuals somebody made the mistake of saying not even God can think it [Applause] huh you know the Titanic just may still be floating if it wouldn't been for them words but watch what you say how many believes that every one of us has to watch what you say God hears what you say Amen Titanic great Titanic and her maiden voice just super ship went down amen didn't go do and bitter good France built the Sig freed line Germany the magnet line super super super ain't that right I believe it was Hitler thought that day was what kind of people white folks anyway anyway uh super race he had a super race and he would uh try to even breed so certain people to certain people to have a super race oh whenever they went and fought against Russia they call them the under menion they underman underman you know a subspecies underman but guess what guess who went into Germany and got it it was the under the under menion beat the superior mention which means they're really the way down they're under the under mention right they weren't so smart after all amen why because they try to achieve it in their own self amen let me say this anybody anytime somebody's trying to be a somebody remember they're not they're not great when we try to be a somebody that's what he was trying to be a somebody Amen on that's right Germany and so forth people he ended up being completely defeated amen praise the Lord listen to this and all the church has got today is history what Moody said sany said finny said Smith said it's a history but God still lives just as he did always it's a history We Begin well we begin in 1909 way back in Luther's time we begin oh my God he says God never did begin and he will never end everything that has a beginning has an end but those who have never had a beginning they don't have no end that's a it's a matter with so much achievements that we make in the world towards building our crops denomination buildings and structures they all begin and they come to an end and we all beginning and an end but when we receive Christ we receive God God is eternal and we become Eternal and God through Spirit which never did begin and never will end don't let that depart from you keep it in your minds and your hearts fresh as long as you live every manmade achievement Must Fall but it's in him to do it like it was in Adam is that something how we were try this and we will try that man will try this and man will try that when God has the correct way every manmade achievement anything that pump anybody does or tries to achieve in the flesh will fail amen that anything that's done in the flesh one place there in the church book brother Adam says those in the bride you know they they know what the will of God is they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still how many believes it's better not to do nothing than to try to do something that's not in the will of God but people can't wait on God people can't pray about stuff committed to God no we got to get our hands on and make this happen make that happen no don't do that oh my when we try to live our own lives amen do our own thing get our own thoughts involved in it amen I think most prayer this morning talking about sometimes we still have our own we still have things in front of God that we don't even realize amen how many beli God's first in everything amen all right praise the Lord you love him all right Romans 8 and then also we'll go to um let me see here 1 Corinthians 1 25 1 Corinthians 1:25 says because of the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men first of all when you begin to think about God remember this what is it that makes God great or super huh before you can become a Superman you got to look at the Superman and how he became Superman what makes him Superman God of all the universe come down and according to the super sign the super sign was that a virgin shall conceive he was born in a manger in a stable of hay isn't that right and that was the super super super super sign amen and that humility God what makes him so great is that come and humble himself humble himself can I just say what comes to mind you know I don't care how long I've been a Christian but I believe there's still a lot of room in Thomas berer to Humble himself more yet I think every one of us could say the same thing humble yourself and I want to say something else if you ever come to the end of yourself you whip yourself you'll only do it by God's grace through his faith amen you'll never you'll never whip Yourself by yourself it takes the grace of God it takes surrendering of yourself to him and if you ever conquer the biggest enemy that you'll ever face is yourself it's ourselves it's our carnal mind it's our own thinking and it's our own ways it's our own selfishness it's our own GED that's the biggest enemy that we have if you conquer that I'm telling you what you won the Super Bowl you won the Super Bowl if you ever equi that amen didn't Better B him say one place he says you know if you can whip yourself if you can C yourself and surrender yourself to God you got more power than to build a guy that can do a flip run the run the aisles run all over Scream and Shout speaking in Tong and everything else cuz a lot of them guys didn't even conquer themselves but if you conquer yourself if you surrender yourself to almighty God you got more power than then than that guy does Amen because it takes a lot to die to yourself Amen to humble yourself amen he was the perfect illustration Jesus was of being super first of all in a manure as brother B said born on a manure pile how many preachers would like to come up here and say yeah well I want to tell you where I was born at I was born in a barn over a manure pile yeah they didn't have any room for me at the hotel they put me out in the stall and I was born out there oh well where do you live well I don't really have a home you know I got to go get some money out of the fish's mouth to pay my taxes say I you know my head next what you ain't got no house you ain't got no bank account no not a dime huh my my my when he came to Simon's house invited for dinner and I've got a question that came to my mind I don't if anybody here can answer it but when he was invited to Simon house and he didn't wash his feet he wasn't welcomed I wonder how many of us the tradition is they will wash your feet they wash you and they anoint you and all of that they welcome you but he just sat back there a probably sat making fun of him sitting there no doubt but Simon Says now foot what Funk when he comes don't you dare wash his feet you just stay over here on the corner of somewhere or you go find something else to do somewhere else you leave him sitting there there he sat is that right there he sat but in the working of God in the working of God he brought Mary isn't that right a prostitute to come wash his feet to wipe them with the hairs of her head to cry wash her with her tears watch his feet with your tears that's right but the question was that I wanted to ask you after that episode did he stay and eat with him or did he leave I don't know Tommy I don't know but after he said Simon I have somewhat to say again to you you know when I came here you did wash my feet you didn't welcome me this out of the other and this woman since I've there did not seee to wash my face and anoy my head amen that's about as far as we know but I just can't imagine Jesus sitting there with the Pharisees neing with him maybe he did maybe he didn't if you know the answer let me know I'd like to know but what a humiliation ain't that right he didn't man standing there and being in humiliation how manyan knows when people humiliate you don't be intimidated know who you are amen Peter says you know if you suffer wrongfully you know be glad Rejoice because you got in heaven is that right what makes us super what makes us super what made Jesus super amen one place he says he that is the greatest he that is super among you shall be your servant a little further up from that he says he says Pharisees the all all the works that they do is to be seen of men they make broad their flat factories and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms of that the feasts and at the chief seats of the synagogues what they say if you go somewhere a feast or whatever it is go down here in a corner somewhere go down there to the washroom find Chair by all the boots and stuff so to speak and then let ask the house go what are you doing out here with P don't sit in the upper room room don't sit up there and say I'm sitting with you bro huh sit right down there he says no I'm sorry bro that seat's taken you go over there I have to suffer humiliation as but be not ye called Rabbi Jesus said and all ye are Brethren stey not Superman or just a natural man will love those who love him they're pretty nice guy and huh that right loving go love you that's the natural man that's right is that right but you know the natural man the reason that we have so many problems in the world is because that's all people are natural because while they can be so nice it can also be so terrible brother brah said a man without the Holy Ghost is a beast he'll ravish a woman throw a baby out of her arm and rash ravish a woman because of his feelings and his emotions and everything else hello amen said if you love them which love you you're not a Superman what reward have you do not even the publicans the same that's right every gang out there every click out there everybody's good to those that are good to them amen but it takes superpower somebody turn slaps you on the face to turn your other G somebody does you wrong how many knows it takes superpower to forgive thing is to punch him back I wanted to say something and I've got this wrote down he's not a Superman he's just a natural man amen but when you can love this way no matter what anybody ever does to you if you can manage never to hold bitterness in your heart to them you're a Superman it takes superpower to do that CU you're natural Man without that Holy Ghost Boy you paid him you won't say it you might even give him a box of candy but in your heart I wish this was an explosive be thinking amen Jesus how many believe Jesus showed us the way to be super and it's by being humble it's being simple it's oh my didn't brother said don't see how great you can be see how little you can be because the little you get the bigger you get spiritually you become Superman and it's not like the world thinks cuz remember this just comes remember Jesus on the cross they said boy you You're great if you're the Messiah show us your power and come on down off the cross and we'll believe you but I'm show showing you my power I'm showing you my power by not coming off off the cross amen he could have called 12 Legions of angels how many can say they can be very glad he didn't they can be very glad he didn't come off the cross because he'd have been like he did with Moses just separate yourself from wipe them off but God isn't come for wrath he came with love and he so full of love that he said father forgive them for they don't know what to do what was it I wrote down on that father forgive them they don't realize what they're doing they don't realize what they're doing you realize half the time when people are like that they don't really realize what they're doing amen forgive them for but they know not what to do he had superpower died to himself that's right when your husband gets hostile and and all mad and aggravated don't get aggravated and mad with him have superpower change it love hat we all know how it goes the other way don't we I love your wings cuz iin got when it come to that I know what it's like to resist no huh oh yeah you know I want to thank God that me and my wife has less cor you need a few quals you know what fights are they're adjustments where you're adjusting you that spocket isn't quite quite working right so guess guess what you're going to have to learn how to bring that down there and let that sprocket fit right in there amen it's a 50/50 deals Amen brother BR preach it y That's Right amen you love the Lord we got 10 minutes praise the Lord amen amen God is good isn't he but that's right I got begin to think what really he was this super sign and he's bringing people into his very image be like Christ have control of yourself amen once the Holy Spirit works on you to get control of yourself those Devils won't be such a problem is that a true statement coming this morning over this Pulpit that if you want you whip yourself if you can conquer yourself the devils are not going to be such a problem why because brother bam said the biggest enemy you have is yourself if you can conquer that great big linebacker I think they're talking about the fridge I remember the fridge from the Chicago Bears right that's right he was the fridge I mean oh my all he had to do that in front of you you wasn't going nowhere amen we've got a big fridge standing in front of us in this hour called lust huh

amen praise the Lord oh my God is good super is down amen that's what it takes to be super is to really get down and die yourself if you want more of the power of God Amen because that's truly any man that ever was a super man was somebody that God used how many wants to be somebody that God could use being anybody that was ever great I don't care if it's Moses special I can't come and preach
