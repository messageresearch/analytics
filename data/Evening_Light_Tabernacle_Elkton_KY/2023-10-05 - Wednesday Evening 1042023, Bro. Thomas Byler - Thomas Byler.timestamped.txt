[35:57] God that you'll say just what you once
[35:59] said Lord Jesus bless the meditation of
[36:02] our heart the reading of the word Lord
[36:04] and that which we feel you've laid upon

[36:07] just ask God that you just bless it now
[36:09] in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[36:14] amen amen praise the Lord if you will I
[36:17] think we will turn to Genesis let's just
[36:20] turn to Genesis 1 amen I woke up this
[36:24] morning and this is what came to my mind
[36:28] and amen it just be to pour out and I
[36:31] said well Lord if that's what we don't
[36:33] me to speak on that's what was speak on
[36:35] amen amen I kind of feel like it's uh
[36:39] you know what something that Peter had
[36:41] said he says you know uh I want to come
[36:44] and he says stir up your pure Minds by
[36:49] way of remembrance amen you know it's
[36:52] not about maybe preaching something new
[36:54] or different but amen sometimes we know
[36:56] need our Pure mind steered up amen so
[37:00] Genesis 1 and we'll begin with the first
[37:03] two verses in the beginning God created
[37:06] the heavens and the Earth and the Earth
[37:09] was without form and void and darkness
[37:12] was upon the face of the deep and the
[37:14] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[37:16] waters and God said let there be light
[37:19] and there was light and God saw the
[37:21] light that it was good and God divided
[37:24] the light from the darkness may God
[37:26] blessings to the reading of the word you
[37:28] can be
[37:30] seated amen I really wanted to uh uh
[37:35] have basically a lot more that ready
[37:38] than what I did but this is about kind
[37:41] of as far as amen I studied so we'll go
[37:44] as far as we can just see how far the
[37:46] Lord will take us amen and it I don't
[37:49] know if we'll speak on this Sunday again
[37:51] or not but it's certainly something that
[37:53] you
[37:55] could for several Services
[37:58] amen and my title tonight is an
[38:03] or actually in in in It's actually an
[38:08] imp I put under there I called it an
[38:10] overview of a Christian but it's an
[38:13] indepth look at a Christian amen praise
[38:16] the Lord and there's one quote that I
[38:19] basically started out with that my mind
[38:21] came my mind came to and so it's
[38:25] something brother Bram had said
[38:27] uh but I'm going to read the quote
[38:29] before Amen to try to get us a picture
[38:32] of basically you know what he was
[38:35] thinking about where he was going
[38:37] basically before he makes this statement
[38:40] amen so he says now we see what a bundle
[38:43] that we've got talking about the world
[38:45] and its condition he say the whole world
[38:47] has become a conglomeration of Muk
[38:51] and you can imagine this back in the
[38:55] six
[38:58] is that right he said it's Allen and he
[39:01] says and it's got to get that way to
[39:04] blow up amen got to get that way to blow
[39:10] up and then he goes into talking about
[39:12] things that we've pulled out all the all
[39:16] the gases and the oils out the Earth
[39:18] took all the steel out and it's barely
[39:20] hanging by a thread to where he makes a
[39:22] sound amen as far as we've taken and and
[39:26] and what we've done with the Earth then
[39:28] he comes back to the people and then
[39:31] there one Great Big
[39:34] M till it just like it was at the
[39:37] beginning it grieved God that he ever
[39:40] made
[39:41] man
[39:43] amen
[39:46] amen that's you know you talk about God
[39:49] having feelings how many believe God has
[39:52] feelings I believe if I remember right
[39:54] brother Bandon one time was ministering
[39:56] ring and he he did the a the sign of the
[40:00] Messiah and so forth and made an altar
[40:02] call and just about three people or
[40:04] something like that would come up you
[40:06] know and he says you know that really
[40:08] hurt him you know after he would do that
[40:11] and then
[40:12] nobody
[40:15] responds I don't know about you I'd like
[40:18] to been in one of them servants wouldn't
[40:19] you have Amen to know that that was
[40:22] Jesus Christ amen the
[40:24] resurrected Jesus Christ right there
[40:26] doing the same things he did and hadn't
[40:28] really done it for 2,000 years amen not
[40:31] on that level anyway but anyway so it
[40:35] grieved God that he ever made man he
[40:37] says and it just takes one little Atomic
[40:39] jar to set the whole thing out of order
[40:42] there just exactly what he said that he
[40:45] would do see amen and I thought I might
[40:48] read that scripture before I read the
[40:49] quote that I want to start with amen um
[40:54] and I'll just once again it's very
[40:56] familiar scriptures and basically what
[40:58] the the Bible talks of what's going to
[41:00] happen he says but the day of the Lord
[41:02] second Peter 4 I believe it is or three
[41:05] and verse 10 but the day of the Lord
[41:06] will come as a thief in the night into
[41:09] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[41:11] great noise and the elements shall melt
[41:14] with fervent heat the Earth also and The
[41:17] Works uh the works that are therein
[41:20] shall be burnt up amen so we know that
[41:24] Heavens is going to be on fire the Earth
[41:26] is going to be on fire amen and all the
[41:31] works that are therein shall be burnt up
[41:34] amen now I I just try to imagine because
[41:37] I don't think anybody I really don't
[41:39] think anybody uh is capable of imagining
[41:44] what's going to
[41:46] happen if I was going to try to imagine
[41:48] it because the Bible says the heavens
[41:50] are going to be dissolved they're going
[41:51] to be on fire they're going to burn
[41:53] they're going to pass away the Bible
[41:55] says right there heaven will pass away
[41:57] the Earth will pass away in other words
[41:59] die or change from one form to another
[42:01] right and just imagine and I don't know
[42:05] the gases whatever is out there uh he
[42:07] talks about one to set it off and blow
[42:09] it up and perhaps an atomic chain a fire
[42:13] but
[42:14] in so hot I mean the heavens is going to
[42:17] be so hot and I would believe that it's
[42:19] going to be Universal that mean it's
[42:21] going to be on the other side of the
[42:22] Earth the whole ball everything's going
[42:24] to be under Fire it's all all going to
[42:27] burn with extreme
[42:31] heat extreme heat it's all going to be
[42:37] burnt up
[42:41] germs and they'll wear masks over in
[42:44] heaven hello all of the germs will be
[42:47] burnt up isn't that right amen and now
[42:51] and then Paul then Peter says seeing
[42:53] then that all these things shall be
[42:55] dissolved what manner of persons ought
[42:57] you to be in all holy conversation and
[43:01] godliness you know one of the things I
[43:04] want to to say talk what what that
[43:07] encumbers what a Christian encumbers now
[43:09] we realize that when you speak that I
[43:11] can of course go from Genesis to
[43:13] Revelations and we could take an
[43:15] numerable amount of subjects and I've
[43:16] got different subject that I want to
[43:18] perhaps touch on but when we talk about
[43:21] that one of the first things that came
[43:22] to my mind was that is that it's first
[43:25] of all a real Christian is a pilgrim and
[43:28] a stranger here amen how many blows
[43:30] we're just pilgrims and strangers here
[43:33] we're seeking a city whose Builder and
[43:35] maker is God we're looking for a new
[43:38] heavens and
[43:40] a new Earth where we won't never have
[43:45] crookedness no corrupt no lying and all
[43:48] of that that'll all be
[43:50] gone how's looking for a place where
[43:53] righteousness dwells where life dwells
[43:57] where happiness dwells where Joy dwells
[44:01] where Perfection dwell that's what I'm
[44:03] looking for that's what a Christian is
[44:05] looking for
[44:07] amen amen so he says if we're looking
[44:10] for that we realize we seeing that all
[44:12] these things and what kind of people
[44:14] basically what kind of people ought we
[44:16] to be looking for the Hasting of the
[44:18] coming of the day of God where in the
[44:20] heavens being on fire shall be
[44:25] dissolved and the elements shall
[44:28] melt with fent
[44:30] heat
[44:32] everything that's going to be be
[44:37] hot boy the world needs to realize this
[44:40] don't they nevertheless we according to
[44:43] his promise look for a new heavens and a
[44:45] new Earth
[44:46] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[44:50] beloved seeing that you look for such
[44:54] things be diligent that you may be found
[44:56] of him oh I love this in
[45:01] peace amen not war not stress not Strife
[45:04] not worry not fear fear not
[45:08] right amen none of those things belong
[45:10] to a Christian amen that you may be
[45:13] found of him in peace without spot and
[45:18] blameless woo Peter you're making a big
[45:21] demand here a't that right without spot
[45:26] and
[45:27] blameless in other words he can't put a
[45:29] finger on
[45:31] you amen how many know that's something
[45:34] you have to work out your own salvation
[45:36] with fear and trembling nobody can make
[45:39] you righteous and holy that's something
[45:41] you got to find between you and God Amen
[45:45] on your prayer bones so to speak is
[45:48] where you make sure that the blood of
[45:50] Jesus Christ is there because that's the
[45:53] only way you'll ever be blameless is if
[45:56] the Holy Spirit has Sanctified and
[45:58] washed you and filled your heart
[46:02] amen amen praise the Lord amen all right
[46:07] because that has a little bit to do
[46:08] because I want to back up because I'll
[46:10] tell you amen when I think about this
[46:12] even coming out amen after all these
[46:14] other things that was here I said I had
[46:15] done forgot half of the stuff at first
[46:17] that I wanted to say I said man you know
[46:20] you're just going to need God to be able
[46:21] to get it keep it all together amen but
[46:24] what I was trying to say is we go back I
[46:26] want to read that in Genesis again
[46:27] because the Earth was what void isn't
[46:29] that right amen and just like your heart
[46:32] not my heart without God there's a big
[46:35] void right there isn't it amen we'll
[46:38] talk about that in a minute let's go to
[46:40] where amen the initial scripture or the
[46:42] quotes that that uh that I wanted to
[46:45] read now I want to say this before I say
[46:46] that and that is amen that you might say
[46:48] well brother B you read a lot of quotes
[46:50] I wanted to say this ver I want to say
[46:52] you know I might sound like a parrot
[46:55] sometimes times you know like a parent
[46:58] well just he says something so you say
[47:02] something can read this and it's all
[47:06] good we know it's absolutely truth amen
[47:10] my words might fail but this word will
[47:12] never fail amen so I really like the
[47:15] first of all to say speak this and then
[47:18] in the prophet's messages he says if
[47:20] I've told you the truth if he don't come
[47:21] and back it up you ain't got to believe
[47:23] the word I said right amen so if the
[47:26] prophet if Jesus Christ came and
[47:27] Vindicated what he said well I've got a
[47:29] lot of confidence in what he said so if
[47:34] I just say what he said because didn't
[47:35] brother B say he says now just say
[47:37] what's on them tape don't put your own
[47:39] interpretation don't try to figure it
[47:40] out just say what's on them tapes and
[47:42] say Amen stay with that tape teaching in
[47:45] other words if you can't back it up with
[47:46] that amen then then just stay away from
[47:49] it but you got to want to say what he
[47:51] said so I've Got Confidence that when
[47:53] I'm saying what he said I'm saying the
[47:55] right thing how many believes that so if
[47:57] I speak that a little bit don't be
[47:59] offended I just like to do that because
[48:01] if I say something in myself well I may
[48:04] say well you didn't really need to come
[48:07] to church you could just do something
[48:08] different right I might say something
[48:10] that would be off but when I say what he
[48:12] said hello and that's what I want to say
[48:14] not think my own self but only what he
[48:16] said only what the scripture says how
[48:19] many believes
[48:21] that now notice the next quote that I
[48:23] was talking about he says the whole
[48:24] thing's out of cater of God was griefed
[48:26] and so forth so we are just living in
[48:29] that day and happy to be a
[48:34] Christian
[48:36] amen an overview of a Christian first of
[48:39] all how many believe that a
[48:41] Christian oh my has
[48:44] happiness the only real person real
[48:46] people that are in the world that
[48:48] actually have a little happiness about
[48:50] him go to Walmart go to Walmart and sit
[48:53] out there while you're picking up your
[48:54] groceries and waiting sitting there in
[48:56] the car look at the people going by and
[48:57] see how many is Happy look happy no not
[49:00] very many look happy do
[49:02] they no so oh my what could I do he says
[49:07] I believe brother says I believe that i'
[49:10] go wild if I wasn't a
[49:13] Christian looking at the
[49:20] thing look at how many knows it it could
[49:23] just burn up any
[49:24] time

[49:40] in you you realize that this thing's
[49:42] coming to an end amen you'll have to
[49:44] give an account on the day of
[49:47] judgment but the B says he'd go wild if
[49:50] I wasn't looking at it he says I don't
[49:52] see how people can stand it I just just
[49:55] don't understand how a man can walk on

[58:26] not God's going to take their excuses
[58:29] right away from
[58:32] them anybody that ever heard John 3:16
[58:36] for God so loved the world that he gave
[58:38] his only begotten son that whosoever
[58:41] believeth in him should not perish but
[58:43] have everlasting life for he came not to
[58:46] condemn the world but that the world
[58:48] through him might be saved if they know
[58:52] that but it wasn't for for me it was I
[58:56] don't believe that he meant it for me
[58:58] the word said whosoever
[59:03] will huh whosoever he didn't say Jews
[59:07] Gentiles Russians Chinese or any other
[59:11] group whosoever anybody he left it wide

[59:38] that he'll bring that up he put the
[59:41] conscience in you if you ever go to hell
[59:43] how many knows if you go to hell you'll
[59:46] have to jump over every one of his
[59:49] blockades all of his tire strips all of
[59:52] his uh barricades and everything else he

[59:57] going to hell and you got to jump every
[1:00:00] last one of them if you're ever going to
[1:00:01] make it
[1:00:06] there
[1:00:08] amen my Give Me A
[1:00:12] Reason there ain't no
[1:00:14] reason not to be a
[1:00:19] Christian that's right simply because

[1:00:27] huh they say well I don't want to accept
[1:00:30] that Mercy I don't want that kind of
[1:00:32] Mercy people that don't accept that kind
[1:00:35] of
[1:00:36] Grace whatever form or fashion you want
[1:00:39] to put it whatever excuse or whatever
[1:00:41] they might say about it you're saying
[1:00:44] that you don't want that
[1:00:46] Mercy you will pass on this
[1:00:50] Mercy when you don't accept it you're
[1:00:52] saying I will pass on that type of Grace
[1:00:55] you don't have to go to hell you don't
[1:00:57] have to burn you can live throughout the
[1:00:58] ceaseless ages truly live

[1:01:08] of what heaven's going to be
[1:01:12] like
[1:01:14] amen and you want to pass on that you
[1:01:17] have to
[1:01:19] either pass on it or you have to accept

[1:01:53] damned how many you reckon how many
[1:01:56] times Jesus is going to pull that quote
[1:01:58] up because you know we we know that the
[1:02:00] Bible is what God's going to use to
[1:02:02] judge the World by so he'll use those
[1:02:05] scriptures you heard the scriptures you
[1:02:07] knew what it said he that believeth in
[1:02:09] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:02:10] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:02:13] signs shall follow them they believe in
[1:02:14] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:02:16] shall they take up serpents or anything
[1:02:18] like that and so forth amen they still
[1:02:21] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:02:22] recover oh and you didn't believe in
[1:02:24] Healing The Sick and and casting out
[1:02:26] devils and all of that but I put it in
[1:02:28] there that's why brother says man people
[1:02:30] that claim to be a Christian and then
[1:02:32] don't believe the word of God their life
[1:02:34] is not worthy of the
[1:02:37] Gospel amen if we get that far we want
[1:02:40] to talk about A Life That's not worthy
[1:02:42] of the Gospel A Life That's worthy of
[1:02:43] the Gospel or what we might call worthy
[1:02:46] to be a Christian worthy to call
[1:02:48] yourself a
[1:02:50] Christian
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:55] I want to jump up on this thing I'll
[1:02:57] control my emotions but when I think
[1:02:59] about what he done and what he gave me
[1:03:03] what it is to be a Christian well it
[1:03:05] just makes me act a little
[1:03:07] crazy
[1:03:09] Overjoyed
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:13] amen if I get to it we want to speak
[1:03:16] about keeping your emotions in
[1:03:19] check keeping your emotions in check
[1:03:22] amen but now I thought I said you know
[1:03:25] the emotions that you have for the Lord
[1:03:27] and for his goodness if you get a little
[1:03:29] emotional that'd be all right but you
[1:03:31] would be amazed what I will show you an
[1:03:33] example of sometimes we let things
[1:03:35] dismay us and so forth amen all right
[1:03:38] I'm get aheading myself praise the Lord
[1:03:41] can't give a sensible reason Oh my he
[1:03:45] said this is the day that we ought to be
[1:03:49] happy and
[1:03:50] ready the great homecoming time is that
[1:03:55] H if he could say that back in the 60s
[1:03:58] what about
[1:04:00] today how many believe the homecoming is
[1:04:03] right around the
[1:04:05] corner could happen before morning we're
[1:04:09] just about ready to go
[1:04:13] home aen how many believe that if you
[1:04:16] truly believe that it will adjust your
[1:04:20] life if you really believe we're fixing
[1:04:22] to go home you will adjust anything that
[1:04:24] needs
[1:04:26] adjusted because Jesus said many he
[1:04:28] times he talked about he's going to come
[1:04:31] and a thief in a night and two will be
[1:04:32] left and one one will be taken the other
[1:04:34] one left and so forth but he said but be
[1:04:36] ready for you know not the day nor the
[1:04:39] hour part of the seven sealed mystery is
[1:04:42] a great mystery of not knowing when he's
[1:04:44] coming we don't know when he's coming
[1:04:46] that's the
[1:04:48] surprise oh my didn't mean to go here
[1:04:54] but when he actually
[1:04:56] comes when he takes his little bride
[1:05:00] home
[1:05:03] amen
[1:05:06] amen praise the
[1:05:08] lord we ought to be
[1:05:12] happy praise the
[1:05:15] Lord amen all right let's start let's go
[1:05:19] back to Genesis
[1:05:23] again
[1:05:24] Genesis God created the heavens and the
[1:05:28] Earth the Earth was without form and
[1:05:31] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:05:34] the deep but the spirit of the Lord
[1:05:36] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[1:05:40] waters and I've always thought that this
[1:05:43] is a good
[1:05:45] parallel of a person that's a God is
[1:05:49] shine in their hearts and their lives
[1:05:52] and the void that you have amen we know
[1:05:56] uh uh what was it um you know at one
[1:05:59] point he talks about God divided the
[1:06:01] light from the darkness how much I
[1:06:03] believe it is in the rising of the sun
[1:06:05] brother bam said he talked about how
[1:06:07] that God is separating the light from
[1:06:09] the darkness is that right that was in
[1:06:12] this day this is a day that is gross
[1:06:13] Darkness upon the Earth and God is
[1:06:15] separating the darkness from the light
[1:06:17] other words he's bringing his children
[1:06:19] into the light because it's really a
[1:06:22] great
[1:06:23] light oh my here we go think about it
[1:06:26] this is the the what you're believing
[1:06:28] right there the pillar of fire what God
[1:06:31] did in this generation Malachi 4 brought
[1:06:34] the greatest light since the time of
[1:06:37] Christ we had Dark Ages when it was
[1:06:40] almost left out but this is the greatest
[1:06:42] light what was that that
[1:06:44] light the sign of the Messiah when that
[1:06:48] woman said you know we what he did
[1:06:50] through brother bam is that right amen
[1:06:52] deser her thoughts intense of the
[1:06:55] heart something that hadn't been done
[1:06:57] for a long long long time we know that
[1:06:59] that was the Messiah without a question
[1:07:01] the truth is here that truth is
[1:07:03] Vindicated that's the light of the
[1:07:06] hour right in the middle of the darkest
[1:07:09] place that there is the world is
[1:07:11] certainly in Gross Darkness ain't it the
[1:07:15] not non-Christian is in Gross
[1:07:22] Darkness oh my
[1:07:26] Clinton came out with don't tell don't
[1:07:28] ask don't tell not homosexual look where
[1:07:31] they've
[1:07:33] went into not even know what a male and
[1:07:35] a female free in court to ask her what's
[1:07:37] a man and a
[1:07:42] woman really tell her whatever she
[1:07:46] couldn't even tell you what a man and a
[1:07:47] woman is that's gross darkness in the
[1:07:52] brain
[1:07:58] better
[1:08:02] one thought had a good one but I found a
[1:08:05] better one I don't know how I said that
[1:08:06] but anyway we want to go to I believe it
[1:08:09] is
[1:08:13] in let me see if that's where it
[1:08:18] is Corinthians I believe it is
[1:08:20] Corinthians 2 Corinthians 4 2
[1:08:24] Corinthians
[1:08:26] 4 can we take our
[1:08:31] time all right first we want to and
[1:08:33] we'll talk about the create first of God
[1:08:36] created the heavens and the Earth and he
[1:08:41] created a light to shine in the darkness
[1:08:44] he separated the light from the
[1:08:46] darkness in verse chapter 4 therefore
[1:08:49] seeing that we have this ministry
[1:08:52] chapter 4 of 2 Corinthians
[1:08:54] we have uh as we have received Mercy we
[1:08:58] faint not but have renounced the hidden
[1:09:00] things of dishonesty not walking in
[1:09:02] craftiness nor handling the word of God
[1:09:04] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[1:09:06] truth commending ourselves to Every
[1:09:08] Man's conscience in
[1:09:10] dis if our God be hid gospel be hid it
[1:09:14] is to them that are lost in whom the God
[1:09:17] of this world ha
[1:09:20] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:09:23] not least the light of the Glorious
[1:09:26] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[1:09:29] should shine upon
[1:09:32] them amen how many know that was scribes
[1:09:36] and Pharisees they believe not and the
[1:09:39] devil blinded their eyes they could not
[1:09:42] see that he was a Christ
[1:09:44] hello or CUA how many knows that if that
[1:09:48] light ever shines down in that seed it
[1:09:51] quickens the seed like it did with the
[1:09:53] woman at the well she had
[1:09:56] representation when that light shined on
[1:09:58] her it quickened her to the
[1:10:01] word
[1:10:03] amen but on them the light don't go down
[1:10:06] because of unbelief how many know that's
[1:10:09] what the world's problem is and if
[1:10:12] there's anything you're not receiving
[1:10:13] from God remember the only thing that's
[1:10:16] keeping you away from the promises and
[1:10:18] the blessings of God is
[1:10:21] unbelief no matter what it is
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:27] unbelief now notice or that light of God
[1:10:30] of Christ which the
[1:10:36] image upon and ourselves your servant
[1:10:38] for Christ Jesus sake now here's where
[1:10:41] he types it in with even Paul brings it
[1:10:44] in with Genesis 1 for God who commanded
[1:10:48] the light to shine out of Darkness amen
[1:10:52] amen has shined in our hearts to give
[1:10:57] the light of the GL uh the knowledge of
[1:11:00] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:11:05] Christ hallelujah how many glad that
[1:11:08] that light shine in your heart that
[1:11:12] little void the Earth without full
[1:11:15] mine when I think about what I was as a

[1:11:26] sisters that had no
[1:11:30] anchor do whatever I felt
[1:11:33] like whatever crazy things somebody

[1:11:42] all and not much of a man brother
[1:11:45] Brad not much of a
[1:11:52] man

[1:12:00] seed was quickened you come to life and
[1:12:03] how many knows if you're ever going to
[1:12:04] be a Christian that seed has to come and

[1:12:59] beautiful beautiful
[1:13:01] sunshine now how many knows what the
[1:13:03] True Light of the believer is it's Jesus
[1:13:10] Christen because at the second rising of
[1:13:12] the Sun that the P talked about when
[1:13:14] Jesus rose from the dead he was going to
[1:13:16] bring light and the light of the Gospel
[1:13:19] was going to bring all the Sons and
[1:13:21] Daughters of God Amen he's going to

[1:14:16] but we have this treasure in Earth and
[1:14:18] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:14:20] may be of God not of us
[1:14:24] amen praise the Lord maybe we'll come
[1:14:27] back to verse eight and on
[1:14:32] down a little bit further on but I want
[1:14:34] to go and we want to talk to uh talk
[1:14:38] about kind of person has a right to call
[1:14:41] himself a
[1:14:45] Christian y want to find
[1:14:48] out what kind of person has a right to
[1:14:51] call himself a Christian
[1:14:55] brother B says now let me stop here this
[1:14:57] afternoon and say this that each one of
[1:15:00] you people that's been borned again of
[1:15:02] the Holy Spirit you remember the very
[1:15:05] hour where the Holy Spirit the very spot
[1:15:07] where he met you when doubts come when
[1:15:10] fears are begin to
[1:15:13] rise there's always that certain
[1:15:17] place that you can come back to God and
[1:15:20] the devil can't tread on those sacred
[1:15:22] sins it's where you met God and you talk
[1:15:25] to him though fears and things rise it
[1:15:29] has nothing to do with it you know you
[1:15:31] met God on those sacred
[1:15:35] Sands
[1:15:37] amen friend no matter what you've done
[1:15:40] if you still haven't got that real trust
[1:15:43] and faith in God that real something
[1:15:46] that's real in your
[1:15:48] heart that you know that you met God on
[1:15:51] them sacred s where you can go right
[1:15:54] back there on
[1:15:56] the back side of the desert like Moses
[1:15:59] did and meet him there and put your
[1:16:02] finger on that place where it happened
[1:16:04] it won't work if you think you've been
[1:16:08] there and you still care for in there
[1:16:11] your life proves it another one no man
[1:16:16] has a right to take the pulpit to preach
[1:16:18] the gospel unless he has had a backside
[1:16:22] of the desert
[1:16:24] experience how many know says you know
[1:16:26] you can't you know the it has to be you
[1:16:30] have got to have a revelation of Jesus
[1:16:33] Christ he said I believe it's Jesus said
[1:16:35] you know who who is the son of man and
[1:16:37] so forth and Jesus Peter said Thou Art
[1:16:39] the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:16:41] Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to
[1:16:43] you how many knows a secondhand
[1:16:47] experience is not worthy of you calling
[1:16:49] yourself a Christian just because your
[1:16:51] mom and dad brother sister somebody else
[1:16:53] just because a preacher amen this side
[1:16:55] or the other you can't have a secondhand
[1:16:57] experience God don't have any
[1:17:00] grandchildren you have there has to be
[1:17:03] something that happens
[1:17:06] between you and
[1:17:15] God I'm going to say this I've met
[1:17:18] people that and I don't know maybe
[1:17:20] there's people in here that you just
[1:17:22] don't know when and how but you just
[1:17:23] pray about that but I've met people that
[1:17:24] could not take me to a time and a place
[1:17:27] let me tell you something things didn't
[1:17:29] go so
[1:17:30] well they didn't do so
[1:17:33] good they didn't do so good at all when
[1:17:36] it comes to being proving themselves a
[1:17:39] Christian amen because how many believe
[1:17:41] that if you're a Christian born a
[1:17:43] Christian you're gonna be a Christian
[1:17:45] there's things in this Bible that
[1:17:46] overrides your feelings your emotions or
[1:17:48] anything else it overrides it the Holy
[1:17:52] Ghost will give you the
[1:17:54] power to
[1:17:56] conquer like brother B says if you're
[1:17:58] still loving the world or these other
[1:18:00] things and you then you uh haven't got
[1:18:02] it now
[1:18:05] notice no man has a right to pulpit and
[1:18:08] preach the gospel unless he's had a
[1:18:10] backside of the desert experience no man
[1:18:14] no person has the right to call
[1:18:16] themselves a
[1:18:19] Christian a Christian I'm a
[1:18:24] Christian how many
[1:18:26] knows the saying the saying is the
[1:18:30] biggest stumbling buck that the world
[1:18:32] has ever had is somebody that claims to
[1:18:36] have a to be a Christian but
[1:18:38] isn't he's a professor or a how do how
[1:18:42] does that go he has a confession without
[1:18:46] having a
[1:18:48] possession right confesses to be a
[1:18:51] Christian but but he doesn't possess the
[1:18:53] quality of it a
[1:18:56] hypocrite is the biggest stumbling block
[1:18:58] the world
[1:19:01] has I'm sure you've heard it so how many
[1:19:05] believ that we ought to make sure make
[1:19:07] sure let me say this as your pastor make
[1:19:10] sure that you're born
[1:19:13] again make sure young people as you get
[1:19:17] to the age of accountability that you
[1:19:19] have an experience with almighty God
[1:19:22] personal EXP experience can I say a
[1:19:24] personal walk with God a personal
[1:19:27] relationship with God just religion
[1:19:30] ain't going to cut it just being a
[1:19:31] church member isn't going to cut it
[1:19:33] you'll never live a Victorious Life the
[1:19:35] devil will whip you around he'll use you
[1:19:37] in so many ways you couldn't even begin
[1:19:39] to imagine I'm a personal witness of
[1:19:42] it and a person that doesn't really have
[1:19:44] a possession they will absolutely make
[1:19:46] Havoc
[1:19:49] amen wo but anyway that all
[1:19:53] right thank
[1:19:57] you no person has the right to call
[1:20:00] themselves
[1:20:01] a until Dave had a backside of the
[1:20:05] desert
[1:20:06] experience amen he says it's still the
[1:20:09] back side of the desert what we
[1:20:11] call an upper
[1:20:14] room or side of the desert experience
[1:20:18] amen it's still a backs side of the
[1:20:19] desert too it's where you met God

[1:20:37] this and don't you ever let this pass
[1:20:39] from you if ever a man stood on that
[1:20:43] secred Sands at the backside of the
[1:20:46] desert when he meets God face to face
[1:20:50] there's not enough devils in all of hell
[1:20:52] that can ever take that away from
[1:21:00] him

[1:21:32] thought I was just gonna float
[1:21:34] away I was just so oh happy free I knew
[1:21:38] that my sins were forgiven I know that
[1:21:40] God had filled me with the Holy Ghost

[1:22:19] Christian unless you have had a real
[1:22:21] experience with all my God and you met
[1:22:23] him and he did something for you that no
[1:22:26] devil can ever take away from
[1:22:30] you we're going to take the next 10 10

[1:28:29] enough you think the walls of Jericho
[1:28:31] they had so much comfort in and R Jed it
[1:28:34] wasn't big enough to stop the sons of
[1:28:42] God Samson he had experience with God
[1:28:46] didn't he a thousand weren't enough
[1:28:49] brother John a thousand weren't enough
[1:28:53] he killed a
[1:28:55] thousand before they grew a
[1:28:59] brain I can imagine there was probably
[1:29:02] 10,000 maybe 20 I don't know how many
[1:29:04] there was but I can imagine it was a
[1:29:06] real crowd and after a thousand lay dead
[1:29:10] heaps upon
[1:29:11] heaps
[1:29:14] huh maybe he killed this one this one
[1:29:16] this one this one this one this one this
[1:29:17] one this one and they build it up on
[1:29:19] them they had to crawl up out of there
[1:29:21] you know get down there and here to come
[1:29:23] again he had a whole bunch of heaps
[1:29:26] heaps upon heaps the Bible
[1:29:29] say finally the captain maybe he was up
[1:29:31] on top of the hill somewhere okay guys I
[1:29:35] let enough of you die let's grow a brain
[1:29:37] here all right stop pull back well you
[1:29:40] ain't going to get
[1:29:41] him how many believes he could have been
[1:29:44] 10,000 could have been 20,000 when God
[1:29:47] gives you
[1:29:49] strength how many believe that that's
[1:29:51] what you and I have we have God's
[1:29:54] strength the power is of him the Bible
[1:29:56] says didn't Paul say that the power may
[1:29:58] be of him and not of
[1:30:03] us how many knows Moses coming down to
[1:30:06] Pharaoh the greatest
[1:30:08] Pharaoh what would it
[1:30:10] be you can't really go to up to our
[1:30:13] president nowadays and say well you
[1:30:14] better bow or whatever nowadays he
[1:30:16] probably would but you take e and how
[1:30:19] and everybody else you take some of them
[1:30:20] guys and you have some they come up here
[1:30:22] and says now look you better do this
[1:30:23] that or the other a that right they says
[1:30:26] don't you realize we're a superpower we
[1:30:28] just conquered Japan and we just
[1:30:29] conquered Hitler and everything else we
[1:30:31] got
[1:30:32] nukes huh that's kind of how it was with
[1:30:35] Moses and Pharaoh he was the superpower
[1:30:37] of the day and Moses goes up to him and
[1:30:39] says I'm here to tell you God says let
[1:30:42] my people
[1:30:43] go huh made a real Warrior out of him
[1:30:47] because he had a backside of the desert
[1:30:49] experience he met God and he was there
[1:30:51] and and that's the prophet he take his
[1:30:52] wife and his little child on a
[1:30:55] mule people asking where you going Moses
[1:30:57] I'm going down to Egypt and we're going
[1:30:59] to get all the millions of slaves we're
[1:31:01] going to set them free we're going to
[1:31:03] down take
[1:31:05] over
[1:31:07] huh 75 years old or something I
[1:31:12] guess well I don't know how Mo old Moses
[1:31:15] was I don't know but anyway however old
[1:31:17] he was they have thought like brother
[1:31:19] Brown says they thought he was a little
[1:31:20] scile
[1:31:22] yep yep Sons done got to him the back
[1:31:24] side of De done drove that man crazy but
[1:31:27] he wasn't great he knew he had met
[1:31:31] God when you meet God there's nobody
[1:31:35] will ever take that away from
[1:31:37] you nothing can ever take that away from
[1:31:42] you let me tell you something how many
[1:31:44] believes that the saving grace of God is
[1:31:45] is divine it is divine
[1:31:50] work I can't give it to you only God can
[1:31:54] do that for you if you got a hunger in
[1:31:56] your heart for God you just be very
[1:31:58] thankful there's a inkling the slightest
[1:32:01] inkling and I believe brother bam here
[1:32:02] the end I didn't pull that quot down he
[1:32:04] says how many here would like to have
[1:32:05] that experience of meeting God on the
[1:32:08] back side of the desert this is your
[1:32:09] chance amen meet God on the backside
[1:32:12] amen looks like brother uh
[1:32:19] uh Floyd brother
[1:32:22] remember he always talk about how did he
[1:32:25] ran to the altar God says that's your
[1:32:26] last chance that's your last chance how
[1:32:30] many know we heard him a lot of time
[1:32:31] preach and he tell he tell it almost
[1:32:33] every service oh we're going to hear his
[1:32:35] testimony again we're going to hear his
[1:32:36] testimony again does not talk bad about
[1:32:38] it man that's not here right but I liked
[1:32:41] it why because that's one place that he
[1:32:43] could go that's where God did something
[1:32:46] for me and if I don't never say anything
[1:32:49] else hey if I can't tell nobody else
[1:32:51] nothing else man I'm not a very good
[1:32:53] witness what did the prophet of God say
[1:32:55] that you ought to
[1:32:57] do just tell them how God
[1:33:00] lit that's right just tell people how
[1:33:02] God lit we don't we aren't ashamed of
[1:33:05] our test we love our
[1:33:06] testimonies

[1:33:13] come down on the inside folks and it was
[1:33:15] over
