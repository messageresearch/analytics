looks like a mine i'm gonna let it shine [Applause] i'm gonna let it shine well now this i'm is one more great handcrafted praise tonight this morning amen [Applause] i like good old-fashioned singing don't you i was years ago i first came in the message i was preaching up in ohio right outside of cincinnati and i preached and i was just fresh out of the apostolic church come out of the oneness pentecostal group and i didn't know that people just sat and stared at you when you preached i was used to it by getting in with you a lot of times we we didn't need chairs we all we just mostly stood most of the service that's just the way the pentecostal church was and the pastor after the church got me outside and he said you know said you're just a little bit too pentecostal said you hang around long enough said we'll settle you down i said brother i might be pentecostal but i said at least i'm two church ages ahead of y'all look like a bunch of methodists i told my wife i said man they were singing that night i was singing like i was talking about the other night singing you know down at the cross and they were dragging that song out i looked at her so we at church are we at a funeral i mean we come to have church i believe we ought to be able to feel the spirit of god and enjoy god's presence amen and his word ought to cause something to pulsate in your heart amen that's like i said that's where the real music is is in your heart that's what makes melody to him and then all this that we have here this morning just accompanies what's already in our hearts this morning so we certainly appreciate the lord again i know i've said it every night but i mean it with all my heart i appreciate brother byler giving us the invitation i do want to take just a moment and then thank a sister i don't remember your name but brother byler brought me a little offering that you have given to us to help with the hotel rooms i want to say thank you so much for that and i pray that god will return it to you many fold it was a real blessing to us and we thank you for that um brother david last night i walked out i've been every time i preached here so far i've been trying to preach with a certain my mouth not literally but trying to let it melt quick so i can get done fast and then brother dave is going to complain about me preaching short and i said well i'll try to slip a little button in this morning if i can amen just kidding i don't i know i'm not supposed to do that but i just appreciate the lord you're an easy crowd to preach and it's always good to preach somewhere where it's easy to preach people pulling the only two kind of preachers that make me want to preach them that can and them that can't amen and really it's just a gift it's up to you to pull and get what you need from it it's not about us but first night we preached on being sifted and satan eaten trust that something was said that helped you in your christian experience last night we preached on the journey to revival i want you to turn with me this morning if you would to hebrews chapter 12 i'd like to turn over there and we had just a wonderful time so far around the word of the lord and we appreciate it trust something's been said that we preached or sung or whatever that would help you in your walk with christ i mean believe that's what it's all about is our walk with christ i got to study in that one day years ago and i found the first attribute that was ever associated with god in the bible was that his voice came walking in the garden in the cool of the day then i found out enoch walked with god abraham was told to walk before me that's an attribute that's found in every son of god is to build to be able to walk with god walk with his voice walk with his word but then i get confused because sometimes i read the bible tells me to sit and said when christ raised that we set with him in heavenly places and when a man sets it's assigned the work is finished and i want to say this morning i believe in a finished work i believe it's already been accomplished by christ then i'm told to walk with him and i believe that's an every day we're to be walking with him this morning we're going to look at a different position we're not going to look at setting we're not going to look at walking we're going to look at running running that's in the bible too we're taught to run i'm going to speak about that this morning let me just say this before we go any further god is not concerned so much about the position of our body or the posture of our body as much as he's concerned about the position of our hearts and there's three great religions in the world today that all tie back and claim abraham as the originator one of them is the muslim faith the other is judaism then the other is christianity now the muslim faith comes from ishmael that came out of abram you know abram ishmael was not abram's abraham's son he was abram's son and once he got a name change and was changed to abraham that's where isaac came from but then there's a royal seat of abraham and that was christ and all of us are abraham seed and we're heirs for the same promise because we are in christ you believe that them other two religions that we speak about it's important which way they face when they pray and they all want to face jerusalem and pray to the east and pray three times a day as if god's concerned about the the posture of our body but you realize you can be in church you can be at home you ladies can be behind the sink you you mean to be on a job and because that your heart is right god can hear us anywhere we pray because he's concerned about the position of our heart our position never changes that's what we are in christ and i found out paul as i was talking last night he called himself he spent a lot of years in prison most of the books of the bible he wrote was wrote from prison 13 books of the bible he spent a lot of time in prison but he never one time ever called himself a prisoner wrong never he called himself a prisoner of jesus christ he knew he had a position in christ and his location could never change his position but matter if he's in ephesus if he's in rome if he's in the city of philippi wouldn't matter where he was his location could change but his position could never change so our location can never change our position but i do want to say this morning if you run this race you'll find out while these days your position is going to change your location it's going to change you from earth to glory amen that's where we're want to get to this morning is in that great rapture how many wants to be a part of that amen so i want to read this morning if we could from hebrews chapter 12 and i want to read verses 1 and verse 2 and get right into our subject hebrews chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses notice this let us lay aside every weight and the sin which dost so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now i find it odd that the word patience would be used in the light of us running but he doesn't say run with patience the race but run the race with patience then he says verse 2 looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down notice him we're running he's already set down he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god father we thank you for your word this morning lord i know it's the closing service and father we just prayed this morning that even in this service the holy spirit would encourage us that he would speak to every heart we do thank you for the praise reports that we heard this morning no one you're a god that answers prayer you're the same yesterday today and forever you never change father and lord as your prophet said we're not waiting on you you're waiting on us and lord we want this meeting somehow some way that when we leave here we're closer to you father that's our desire may you bless every person this morning may you help us to get out of the way and the holy spirit to use us once again speak to your people and we'll give you praise for all things in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ and the church says amen god bless you you may be seated this morning it is common knowledge yet debatable by some so we'll just take brother branham's word for it the man that penned the book of hebrews was paul the apostle at the same time that he penned the book of hebrews there's no question that he was writing to his hebrew brethren he was writing really to the hebrews the book of hebrews to the hebrews to tell them that they no longer had to live after the hebrews that means this he was trying to bring his age out of law over into grace now i want to say this morning before we ever get started that paul was inspired not by his own thoughts he was not pinning what he was pinning because it was coming from inspiration out of his own intellectual mind what paul was writing was inspired and came directly from a source and that source is from that great pillar of fire that we see hanging in this building this morning many years ago 18 years old i said last night i opened a church there in florida fresh out of the pentecostal church and i started pastoring and a young man out of the church of god came into our services and he said i have a problem with what you preach i said what is it he said i have a problem that two men 2 000 years apart you keep declaring that brother branham preached he didn't call him brother but he called him william branham preached the same gospel that paul preached i said that's exactly the truth brother branham preached exactly the same message that paul the apostle preached he said how can you believe that of all the fearloads and all the teachers we got around christianity there's not one that teaches word by word exactly what paul said i said but in this day it did happen how can you believe that how can two men two thousand years apart preach the exact same message i said i'll tell you why you're thinking that brother branham said in an office with this bible and he studied until he come up with an interpretation that matches paul i said ain't no man can take his bible and do that it's not ever going to come that way he said then how in the world could these two men preach the same golf life and i'll tell you how i said because both of them got the revelation from the exact same source it was a pillar of fire that met paul on the road damascus and it's the same pillar of fire that come back in this day amen and picked up a man by the name of brother branham and through that pillar of fire he was capable of preaching the exact same message that paul preached in the early church he was given a mission to go with the message that would forerun the second coming of christ but then he was given up he was given a commission but then he was given a message and that message god would open the seven seals and he would restore the word exactly how they had it two thousand years ago and this morning sitting in this audience under the hospices of malachi 4's messi listen to me now is a peoples whose hearts have been turned back to the exact same faith that they preached in the early church but that i give god praise this morning to be identified with that but you see the bible teaches us that in the beginning was now you know the scripture in the beginning was the the word the word was with god and the word was god when i first came the message i didn't think brother branham knew the verses in between because he'd always say in the beginning was the word words with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us but it was about 11 verses in between there but that word that he's referring to in john 1 1 is not your bible no it's brother until the question answers it's the first thing that ever came out of god when god gave himself birth that logos that came out of god in the beginning that was the word that was in the beginning with god now it was that logos that was the author of the word the bible because what that word would do it would move upon men and then it would anoint those men inspire those men bring them in up into the spirit until they begin to pen and what they were writing was the mind of god expressed and when they put it on paper or badger skin then we find out that what they expressed was the word of god so it was really the word logos is the author of the written word are y'all with me say amen so you see he moved up on moses to pin the old testament he moved up on paul to pin the new testament he didn't come in this day and move on a man to pin another bible we don't need another bible this bible is our absolute you believe that that same glorified that moved upon moses to penned the bible moved upon paul to write the new testament but listen now it's the same word the same pillar of fire that come down this day in brother bennett's ministry and gave us the perfect interpretation of the word of god with divine vindication making jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever brother sister young man i don't care who you are young lady you're a blessed individual this morning be sitting under a message like we got and that's why i encourage you never let this message get common to you put it in your heart and run with it as fast as you can go to the finish line in this hour that pillar of fire over that prophet's head i'll tell you what brother ben said in the end time this is how he said it he said now brother i seen the word of god perfectly by the word in that amazing statement i have seen the word of god perfectly by the word it was that pillar of fire that made this bible become a new book in this age you know he sat in that office and said i was about to make a horrible mistake but about 12 o'clock he came in the room when he stepped behind that pulpit this message is not the thoughts of william branham it's the thoughts of almighty god expressed through william branham you believe that this is the very mind of god for this age this message got the power and the ability to put us into a wrap it's got the power to change our body but it can't stay in book form it's got to come out these books got to get down in our hearts it's got to change us into the same image of christ now look brother that's what makes me happy because i believe that saint lick at least the lick a portion of that pillar fire has come down into the heart of every man and woman this morning that has the baptism of the holy ghost but it's down in that soul and it's here leading you and guiding you not only through this message in this message and ultimately into a rapture in a body change right on down as brother bam said would lead us into a millennium and i'm a quote with brother banham i'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled knows he's the same yesterday today and forever knows that this is not fanaticism it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i'm identified with a group here tonight yet they're called a bunch of heretics a bunch of fanatics on the count of the word of god but i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ it is the power of god under salvation and i'm one i'm with them living didn't say him i'm with them living epistles spoke of vindicated god veiled in human form in men and women oh glory hallelujah he says aren't you glad to be identified after 50 years with that same group that believes that same thing and sees god identifying himself in the same way that he did back there praise god making him still to this morning jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now let me say this and then we're going to get right in our subject and i'll i'll try to get this shirt to dissolve quickly but that pillar of fire when he returns three different occasions that pillar of fire came to earth don't you ever let nobody tell you that's this intellectual reasoning crowd that tells you that ain't that great pillar of fire that met moses and paul i don't care what that unbelieving crowd says that picture won't never come out of my church i said this crowd will leave before that picture ever leaves you don't want to be identified with that picture you sure don't want me as your preacher i'm not ashamed of my prophet nor that pillar of fire as paul told timothy deep thou therefore not ashamed the testimony of the lord nor of me as prisoner i'm not ashamed of william branham he's my brother just like i'm not ashamed of you but i'm not the one in that photograph he is he's the one god vindicated as the prophet ministering to this age i'm not the prophet messenger i'm just here to repeat what he's already preached and any man worth this salt will only tell you what he preached oh i should be getting some amens now you remember i told you i'm trying to close that generational gap i don't believe there's a message for the young and for the old i believe the same message that's going to change the old is the same message going to change the young the same name the olds baptized in is the same name that you use the young is baptized in the same holy ghost that baptize your mom and daddies it's the same holy ghost that baptizes you the same spirit of god that's gonna change their bodies it's the same spirit of god gonna change your body hey the same takes you the whole generation listen to is the same tape that us younger generations listening to the message ain't changing times change men change but this message ain't changing it's not saith the lord i asked my boy on the way to church i said who won the game last night them two volleyball he said the young people i said see you didn't need me after all praise the lord amen some of y'all will get used to me in a minute you ain't by the third service you probably never will but you realize when that pillar of fire come it didn't it came only brother herrera to it came only to fulfill what had been prophesied when he sent moses down in egypt he didn't send moses to run with a message to actually come up with a message he actually went down there because moses was going to egypt was god's interpretation of what he had already spoken to abraham how that his people would serve join in the strain then and after 400 years i'll bring him out with a mighty hand moses was that man that god was going to use and moses's life became god's interpretation for the day brother do you realize when they come out that upper room i do believe they were drunk i do believe they come out of the windows and doors staggering like a bunch of drunks i do believe that it was nine o'clock in the morning i do believe they were talking to tribal languages under the inspiration the holy spirit no question but what struck me the most was not the fact that they staggered not the fact they were speaking tongues but the fact that they were able to identify what scripture god was interpreting for that hour and peter said i know y'all think we're drunk weeds truck as y'all suppose it's only nine o'clock in the morning but this is the next thing that identified the real evidence of a man being baptized with the spirit he said this this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel saith god when the holy spirit came on peter he was able to identify what scriptures god was interpreting for the hour and he wasn't just packing a bible quote in scripture he was those scriptures being interpreted when they come out of that upper room staggering like trust and speak in other tongues their men were literally god's interpretation for that day and my brother sister when he returned in this hour we're not here just quoting scripture we are the scripture for this day the word is made flesh in you you say oh but i can tell you now brother bannon's malachi 4 this day this scripture's fulfilled i sinualized the prophet that is true but there's also more to that and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers i can say this morning this day that scripture is being fulfilled right here in this building there's people who is the word made threat for this hour you say luke 17 30 the son of man didn't reveal that was in brother banner's ministry this day this great and i believe that too but why don't you finish it all and worship the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together right here this morning is a group of eagles this day gathered around the caucus of the word of god brother we just ain't quoting the scriptures we are the scriptures being lived out to this day i know a mighty angel come down from heaven i know he was close with a cloud again i don't care what that crowd says brother bam said he was there picked up by seven angels guess what i believe he was picked up by seven angels got time to play with that reasoning crowd take some man's ideal who's unvindicated take his opinion over what god's interpreted then the bible said he come down with a mighty voice and when he came down revelation 17 he exposed the mother and all of his daughters but in revelation 18 he said come out of her everybody say my people sitting in this building is my people come on this day this scripture is being interpreted that's why you're not down there in denominations you're here fellowshipping around god's interpretation of the day because you're my people you heard a voice that say come out of it amen and we came out so therefore you're god's interpretation of that scripture i preached it years ago brother bran was you know you know he here he had such a tremendous i'll just say it he had the exact same ministry that jews experienced 2 000 years ago he didn't let us gentiles go in on theology god didn't let us go into theology at the end of the gentile age in the bright age he sent the exact same ministry that they witness at the end of the old testament but i could declare to you this morning and i know i gotta hurry but alpha's now become omega it ain't becoming omega it's already became omega the first is the last they're identically the same the first ministry in the last ministry is exactly the same i i preached this all over the world that's a rag right there right it's in my right pocket if i change this location to my left pocket did i change the rag no i only changed its location its position so when i say alpha's omega what i'm telling you the cornerstone has now become the the headstone it's still the same stone it's just in a different position come on he set this this head this christ it sat down on the church young people you got such a privilege and an honor this morning to hear the things that we hear when you play these pages open them years spend a little time in prayer sometimes we miss brother byler i've been telling my young people at home we got to get back to our prayer meetings we got to get back to them old fashioned time when we led the order we pray god's sweetened our spirit up open us up but then said you can never he said it we could sing too much brother we can do a lot of things too much he said there's one thing we can never do too much and that's praise i said we ought to pray twice as much as we listen to tapes so that what on them tape has got some good ground to get in there and produce fruit in our lives [Music] you love him say man see i told you now it's your fault not mine oh i just feel something turn over my soul this morning you love him now look paul was given a message and his message when he was struck down on the road to damascus going down there to kill christians i couldn't understand why christians were afraid of him i can understand why barnabas son of consolation had to convince his apostles don't be afraid something's happened in this man's life he met that pillar of fire he said who are you lord he said i'm jesus whom you persecute 15th chapter corinthians paul tells about how the apostles saw it after his resurrection seen 500 brother one time seen the cephas in the other and the women but then he turned around said but lost the ball he was seen of me paul didn't meet him in the form that other apostles met him in they met him in flesh paul didn't meet him in a fresh body he met him in the form that he was in after his resurrection which was that purifier that's why he preached jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let me explain what i'm talking about then i'll get right down on into it he didn't preach christ jesus the same he preached jesus christ the same because you'll find out when paul talks about christ jesus he's talking about christ that anointed logos that became a man so it was christ jesus but when he preached jesus christ he was preaching jesus who went back in the form of what he's in before he came flesh and he said that's what's the same yesterday day forever it wasn't jesus of the man that met abraham back there no it was that logos that pillar of fire came down the form of a man called melchizedek come on now but later he was made flesh glory to god now tonight he said he's the same yesterday today and forever what makes i know i'm 51 but i feel 15 tonight that makes my heart thrilled to be able to see that identified in my day what a blessed man i am tonight i heard this message when i was 18. i'm just as excited about it at 51 as i was when i was 18. this message turned my world around hallelujah thank god it did but he met that pillar of fire and there he sold out he said i didn't go to jerusalem i didn't confer the other apostles he'd go up and check out what god gave him by other men he said what i got i got directly from the revelation of jesus christ said glaciers when i certify your brother in the gospel i preach it's not after man neither was it given a man but it came by the revelation of jesus christ glory to god and i believe that so what happened was paul now listen now with a revelation but read the same old testament written by moses that he had always read he'd always studied because you've got to remember the new testament wasn't written when paul met christ the only thing he had to study was the old testament scriptures that's why in christians when he said christ died according to the scriptures he's not talking about the new testament he talked about the old testament he said but he was buried according he's talking about the old testament that he raised again on the third day according to the scriptures so the old testament spoke of christ as death spoke of his barrel spoke of his resurrection i'll go further it spoke of his birth it spoke of his life it spoke of his death it spoke with his bro it spoke of his resurrection and it also spoke of his second coming but all of a sudden now with a revelation meeting christ paul goes back and with a veil tore off his heart and off of his mind he goes back to the same scriptures but this time brother byler when he reads the scriptures all he can see is christ everywhere he looks he sees christ when he sees god coming down with a lamb and covered out of an earth he sees christ what is he's able to sacrifice he sees christ when he sees abraham taking isaac he sees christ everywhere he reads and looked in the old testament all he sees is christ and when he saw christ all he could see was grace so now he started preaching that new testament church we've got to come out a law come over and grab someone paul paul you mean to tell me that we can lay down all the law and all of it's been fulfilled and one man called jesus he said that's exactly what i'm telling you you don't have to go down the synagogue no more and go down to that priest god gave us a priest you ain't got to go down take no lamb no more god gave us a lamb you don't have to be afraid to walk behind the veil now god tore that tail and we can come right into the presence of almighty god through jesus christ hallelujah that takes away all human works and it makes it not works but makes it grace i'm here called the grace you young people believe this message because of grace you'll live for god cause of grace you'll take a rapture cause of grace because when the headstone comes it comes with challenge crying grace grace unto it you imagine he preaches over there and takes that whole hebrews brother bam tells him in hebrews says right to the first chapter the whole book of hebrews is exaltation of who moses the angels no the priest no the exaltation of jesus christ he's greater than the angels to which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son does they have a begotten me to none of them he said he's greater than moses he's greater than the law he's greater than the temple he's greater than the priest matter of fact he said he's not even a high priest after the order of aaron he's a high priest after the order of melchizedek he went on to say that by the blood of bulls and goats you can never take away sin he said but this man offered one sacrifice for sins forever or they caught by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified but if i don't make you love him i don't know what will you mean preacher i don't have to fast to find favor you mean i don't have to go to church to find favor i don't have to preach to find favor i don't have to sing no you're accepted in the beloved because you're in christ you already got favor with god you know what he said every high priest offering up the same sacrifices daily could never take away sins and this is what his words were every high priest stand it daily offering the same sacrifices that can never take away sin you notice what he said every high priest standeth daily stand it daily you notice when they went into the holiness of all a holy place there was no place to sit down because their work would never be done but he said when this man offered one sacrifice for sin he didn't say stands he said he sets he offered one sacrifice princeton and sets down because his work is finished lord of god you don't have to do anything he's already did it you don't have to bring a sacrifice he's already did it he's not asking for your blood he's already got his own blood we don't justify ourselves by our righteousness he's already justified us in the sight of god as though we never sin in the first place now listen what i'm getting to now paul was trying to bring him from law over in the grace i'll tell you what he was doing he was putting the baton of faith in her hand and said here's the baton of faith not works faith not law faith grace take this baton and run run and they were now to i mean they he wanted them to run from law the way joseph ran from potiphar's wife run your life depends on it your reputation depends on it and what he was trying to get in the sea now that we're in a race [Music] let me hurry we're in a race we're in a race you know i'm going to say this brother joe day of pentecost peter got so drunk on the spirit he preached one sermon and 3 000 souls were added to the church today between me and you and brother byler and all these other brothers we got to preach 3 000 sermons just get one soul at it people's let this get common to them god we should never let that happen to us so let me say what i get to what i'm saying we're running a race now each one of us that have come into christ the baton is in your hand now paul i don't have time i preach this stuff in five six sermons at home but he he uses many analogies and most of them are sports to express truth i can show you he used boxing he used wrestling he used running he used a farmer sowing seed i mean there's all kind of analogies the human body that man and his wife all kind of acknowledges expression the one i want to borrow this morning take your mind in this direction is running the race this race of faith every believer once he's in christ is in a race and you are running for your life running to obtain listen now an incorruptible crown right you're not going to get following this message don't expect a lot of accolades from the world you're not going to get them it's not going to happen you don't even hardly get them from people who claim to believe it much less get it from the world so you're running to to win a prize we're going to be down in that just a minute each one of us that run this race have to realize we're running a race oh hallelujah where i believe brother butler i can see the finish line in sight i'm gonna say it like this to you all them that's going on is depending on you to finish this race time now is blending with eternity that means that there's no one after us listen folks if what we know is true when our prophet preached to us there is not eight ages there are not seven and a half ages more than there's eight messengers seven i have messengers william brown is our last major word prophet there won't be another one after him the next one's coming it's coming to israel and you bunch of gentiles don't waste your time unless you've got a dark complexion a long nose stay right here in america keep believing brother branham now y'all don't know what i was talking about paul remember the hook knows jesus ain't making fun of nobody's hook but the point i'm saying is them other two prophets aren't the gentiles they're to jews this is our last gentile major word prophet there will not i didn't say it wouldn't be prophets but they ain't gonna be another major word prophet that's your last one so three seven eight messengers then there ain't eight ages we're now in the bright coming of christ where the bride comes out of the church she's dressed with a message for the second coming of our lord that's happening right here this morning it's already taking place the bride is being called out so what happened when the seed went the ground according to john 12 24 brother being applied that to the bride just like he did to the groom and we went in the ground we but by the time we got to the fourth church age the seed went in the dark denominational dirt wrong but then a light came boring a light came it's like i was talking about last night about that weed growing in them cracks you know why that that concrete because it don't grow down it grows to the light and that seed and you go goes to light my wife and i visited uh a little case over in uh athens tennessee area called the uh royal sea but now they were in this dark room was wherever they put lights there was plants growing up i asked old fellas the joke plant does he said no birds fly and drop the seed we just put light in here and them them seeds got life in them and they grow to the light hey brother satan's tried everything he can to keep your young people believing this message but there's a predestinated seed in you it'll grow to the light it'll recognize the word don't care what anybody else does there's something in you toward the word of god it'll find you one way or another so what happened god sent right in the reformation out of the reformation come martin luther god put the baton of justification in his hand and he started running with all that's within him but he could only run so far but there met him at the end of his run was a man by the name of john wesley he put the baton over in his hand and john the ground john wesley could only thrown as far as he could and put that baton in the hands of pentecost and the pentecostals ran as far as they can but guess what tonight they've handed that baton over to you you're the people that's got that baton and guess what you ain't handing it off to nobody else you're going to cross the finish line and faith without us cannot be made perfect hey this ain't the hour to stumble and ain't down to get your eyes on the crowd that's watching it's keep your eyes on the finish line keep running this way how long i have to run by luke until your body's changed we don't have time to sit down settle down we got to take this message and run with it until our bodies are changed the finish line the finish line remember they without us cannot be made perfect the sad thing is and i don't i'm not saying this to anybody in here but i'm just going to say what i got to say we're finding brother better less runners now matter of fact it's sad but we're seeing many people who used to run well that don't run so well today they've got in the stands and they become spectators instead of participators matter of fact someone even left the track decided they won't want to run no more i got dear preacher friends the day that sold out they got their eye on some wild woman somewhere and took their eye off the prize might as well say it's the truth young people the devil is going to shake everything he can in front of you get your eyes off this message but whatever you do if your brother man said look to the right and look to the left look forward look back say if you ain't got nowhere to look look up keep your eye on christ i'll finish my message this morning with that thought keep your eye on christ you've got to keep your eye you'll say well preachers fail so what christ don't churches fail so what christ don't yeah but this my friend fell show what christ knows you ain't making about them you're making it by christ amen you stay in there until god has sealed you with the holy spirit and you're sealed in i got news for you the devil is still out you're going to have to run this race you're going to have your struggles you're going to have your obstacles you're going to have your battle but if you've got that tie pose down on the inside the inside that anchors you to christ keep your eye on christ and run until you finish this race less runners most this is a sobering thought but most runners that will make up the rapture is already in the graves the majority of them that are going in the rapture is laying in graves this morning as the pyramid i know i got one at home but and i use it as an illustration a lot of times people would love to take the pyramid and flip it upside down and say we're in the wide age we're not the pyramids got to stay the way it is the majority there it is the majority that make up the rapture look at how wide that base is but as we get near to the headstone it gets to be fewer all the time so let me tell you something young people it's good i mean it's good it's good oh it's good it's good to have friends here this morning isn't it good fellowship after church and have some message friends in that good you know how you get friends show yourself friendly you got people church nobody talks to me other bibles are the first ones out the door and in the car and gone i'm wondering why nobody fellowship because you don't hang around long enough fellowship with nobody come on now you got to get out there and shake hands god bless you what's your name get to know hey if you're going to spend eternity shooting he can spend five minutes getting to know him you imagine us getting an eternity walk up and shake somebody's head who are you what do you mean who am i i went to church with you for 40 years you don't know who i am we got to go to heaven to get to know people hey you don't have to pay me for that i just come fresh from heaven you got to have you got to be friendly got to have friends but here's what i am going to say to you don't you expect in this race you know we used to i used to run believe that or no i still do i do five miles a day don't look like it i'm trying to get there built my own track got my own track three times around built my own sidewalk got a whole track around my property my wife and i walk every morning love walking love it ain't got to the place i can run it the whole way yet but i love walking and you know in that race i'm just going to tell you this if you expect we used to run years ago we'd run the mile run i ran it and and there'll be a lot of people starting out and be popping hitting each other i'm just going to tell you straight up don't expect this track to be overcrowded this time you're going to run and you're going to wonder if anybody else is with you hey i'll tell you this when you think nobody else is with you jesus is still with you you just keep on running and it's good every now and then to see one come up beside you might even get out ahead of you let him go but just be glad he's running people want to hold people back don't hold them back if god's bless them go and bless them too praise god i'm glad you're in the raid run with them not against them hey in this race i'm not competing with you i'm competing against you i'm competing with you i'm trying to get there and take everybody else i can with me i want to encourage them hey run this race we can make it together by the grace of god runners nobody's clogging the track up but this is the hour that god's bringing us to perfect well here's a couple scriptures i'm just giving you first corinthians 9 24 mason 5 7 philippians 3 14. read them we're all talking about the same thing it's all about he that runs the race run all but one receiver the prize so run that you may obtain now i'm going to skip some things because this button don't seem to be dissolving i want i want to just i got some high points here i want to get to this is a race your only entrance god help me the only entrance and the power that can put you in this race is a new birth i got seven six sons and one daughter and none of them is in this race of faith because they have cut their teeth on a church pew i got a boy named jeremiah officially get married 25th matter of fact my son i believe met his wife at one of y'all's youth meetings i've been mad ever since just kidding just trying to lighten some of you up because you look so sober this morning smile a while give your face a rest you ever heard that song you know it takes less muscles to smile than it does to frown we've exercised frowning so much that it's hard to make a smile but listen my son's just getting married jeremiah 18 years old his mama come to me a couple years ago and she said have you ever thought about taking jeremiah to south africa with you i was fixing to go on a meeting in south africa performer that boy ain't gonna go with me i said he's such a mama's boy he can't even make his own glass of water i'm not kidding she does everything for them irons their clothes makes up the room and she has spoiled them so you can imagine what it's going to be like for their wives i got a friend of mine you sleep song service he's older and he's passed away you might know him brother brother carver gerald carver anyways gerald carver told me said why don't you know my wife went over and my wife treats me like a god i said really said yeah she even calls me lord i said no brother carver that's not possible yes she does i'll tell her to give me a glass of water she'll say oh lord gerald get it yourself he said she even treats me like a god i said how she brings me burnt sacrifices every day he's a good man she's a good woman he was kidding but jeremiah you know i told his mom and said mom i can't make that boy you know do for him for two solid weeks and i said that's the ironing clothes i don't like iron clothes i learned when i was young 16 because i went out on the field in the pitch i was church preaching my mama taught me how to iron clothes and you know how i put the creases there and the way to do it and in school my clothes were so ironed so bright in high school that i made best dressed because my mama always dressed me just just just always had my shirt tucked in always it looked like a little pentecostal well my wife told me when she met me i come to the church he said we smelled you when you come into brother yancey's church she said i turn around and look to see who this guy was with this roman coming off of him and said look like a little pentecostal prep came in i said well must have done something for you you married him so she said won't you take jeremiah i said mama jeremiah's not gonna go he's a mama's boy i'm not iron his clothes i'm just not gonna do it for two weeks said you should so i'll teach him how to iron i said well whatever you want to do i said just go ask him and i was in the room praying god don't let that boy go i'm going to tell you the main reason wasn't because i iron the clothes because it's going to cost me another 2 400 to take him and i didn't wanna spend twenty four hundred dollars on that boy and so mama come back in there you remember she came back a few minutes ago and said later and said luke he said he'd go so i got online dealt airlines got him a ticket got it already i'm thinking nothing about it got down to port elizabeth south africa to preach my first message that night a little small church probably is about as wide as that here to here they squeezed in about 100 some people hot in there that night and usually i'm nervous brother you know how did you get nervous first place and i'm back in the office and i'm getting nervous but i'm getting really nervous because the message that i want to preach seems like the burning of it's lifting from me and i like to preach by inspiration i like to walk out and know i got the mind of god for that particular service and i was tore up back and i said god what in the world's going on so i just did what i only think i know to do it got on my knees started praying and a little voice inside said don't you preach that i set back up in the chair and say lord i got all kind of messy but what what am i and it's like something just as clear as anything said pick up your bible i picked it up and i opened the john chapter five and i'm telling you i read it and it was about the angel coming out and stirring the water and something spoke to me and said go out there and preach a season of troubling and i went out and preached that when god troubles the waters and my my thought that night was this whosoever will can come but not when so ever anybody can come but only when god calls when he stirs the water i preach that and here's a whole audience but only one boy in that building that night is weeping and crying he wouldn't quit i looked back and there's that jeremiah my old son weeping and crying i said what in the world is going on that boy's heard me for 18 years that night sitting he was it was like i say it was here but he was sitting kind of back there and he kept crying and i had two brother bills that traveled with me and both of them sit on sign he sat and they got to crying because he was crying and brother in that service i made an altar call for them to come to christ the only boy in that building that lifted his hand said he wanted to give himself to christ was my son here mama may have thought it was just a little feeling she was having but it was the leadership of the lord daddy didn't want to take him and i thought it was just her wanting him to travel with me and god was orchestrating that thing he had a little something for jeremiah in that meeting and brother we got back to the little part where we were standing i knelt down started praying thanking the lord for doing something for jeremiah and i felt a presence come in and i raised the cover up over my head i was little down the couch in the living room it was jeremiah setting another count he was crying i said what's wrong son he said daddy i fully surrendered myself to the lord tonight i gave my heart to christ i said boy you know what's next you've heard me tell it he said daddy i know to be baptized i said when we get home he said get home daddy after two weeks i got to be baptized now i took him down to the water in the pool at the church baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ i see god radically changed that boy changed desire thought he was going to college and go go here and do this but something turned him around i'm not against that i'm just telling you god's got a path for us he puts that baton in your head and you gotta run my point is this jeremiah couldn't go on on daddy's coat well jeremiah couldn't go on a mama skirt jeremiah had to have a personal relationship with jesus christ just like every one of you hey brother i'm just going to tell you i told my boys i said sean you can live in this house as long as you like and if you ain't got no conviction you can borrow mine until you get your own and they went to church they never asked us as i said other night my seven children never ask us are we going to church tonight they knew on wednesdays and sundays we're going to church and if there's revival we're going to church paul ain't coming before church school ain't coming before church we put the house of god first in our lives i'm just tell you where it is hey and with all that they still don't know christ until they meet him here's what i'm saying to you rules don't put you in this race leaving my mom and daddy's standards don't put you in this race but when one day them rules come off of a book and them standards and their principles come off a book and go down into your heart glory to god and put you in the race now now you got to pretend baton you got christ now and you go to church not because mom and daddy does you go to church because you love to go to church when mom and dad is sitting at home you're still in the house of god you don't know how many young people i've seen god get a hold of mom and daddy make an excuse why they don't want to go to church on wednesday night and that young person still showed up that shows god has done something inside of them that they don't have a second-handed robe but they got a first-hand revelation from the holy spirit a new birth that's put them in christ and now they're in the race let me tell you this i gotta hurry he said run this race everybody say patience how many kids you know maybe your boys have ever ran track in school any of you you're not allowed i did i ran track how many boys that played baseball oh good you're allowed to do that one okay glad i'm glad you're allowed to do something i said that danny williams i told you other than that daniel you've told me that he said when i was 21 year old boy two had twins our first kids were twins i tell them time another night there was a boy sitting with a girl the other night out there last night i said are y'all brother and sister i knew they weren't i said y'all brothers and sisters no i said boyfriend girlfriend he said trying to be so pray man pray pray pray pray i was dating my wife lisa my daddy on the construction business florida i used to call her back then brother joe we didn't have flip phones like y'all we didn't have that if us guys were going to have a phone it'd like to be carrying a purse we weren't getting out of that car with no purse we didn't wear these things you wrap around there's two fenders looking we just didn't do it and i'd leave that bag in the side between the two seats i travel leave that there my daddy gave it to me still remember and i'd had to open that up and get the phone out u.s cellular or something like that oh i'm talking about you kids don't know nothing about it y'all do don't you yeah and i'd get that phone and i didn't think about cost i didn't realize it cost per minute and so i was calling lisa and we'd fall asleep and she said loop what you said oh no just breathing hard and we uh i got home from the meetings and dad got the deal and it was a thousand dollars a thousand dollars about didn't like a thousand dollars a day that's a lot of money you know and so my dad said son you're not going to preach you're coming off the field you're going to work till you pay this bill that's all right you know i preached for pentecostals you know they were oneness and that's about all you got in the offering was ones and so you couldn't afford to pay no thousand dollar phone bill that's why i'm glad somebody believed it was 120 got baptized in the upper room and so uh anyways my dad made me work and i had to pay that thousand dollars but i found out i told you i said lisa you don't be cheaper if i marry you but you were paying a thousand dollar phone bill then i married her and seven kids come along and said you know i've been cheaper if i just kept paying thousand dollar phone bills it might say patience well the word patience isn't like waiting let me tell you what patience really means it means endurance run the race with endurance now listen to this here's what's strange the word race is where we get the word in english agony run because there's going to be times like brother bam called this message the bread of affliction sometimes it's gonna be painful but you keep running sometimes you're gonna fall get back up sometimes you might fall flat on your face don't stay there the difference between them that win and then the dope is them they keep running even in hard times when the race gets hard and there's affliction there's agony you got to keep oh here's the word i used last night commitment you got to be determined in your own heart if nobody else makes it i'm going to keep running i'm not quitting i'm not stopping i have committed my life to christ and instead committed to him i'll tell you something when that happens you'll find out one of these days as you get older it ain't you holding him it's him holding you i tell you i say this all the time and i mean this i hate to say it this way but you get so far in christ you couldn't quit if you wanted to remember that sith that i talked about that first night one of the great symptom times came in john 6. all jesus said was except you eat the flesh the man drinks blood got no life in you all the preachers and everybody walked away from him then he turned to twelve said were y'all also simpson time came they said whom shall we go i'm going to tell you something not one of those apostles could have stood there and said hey lord we go nowhere we understood exactly what you said i'm going to tell you something them 12 didn't understand that statement no more than that bunch walked away the only difference between them 12 and them ones that walked away is not because they understood his state but they understood the one who made the statement sometimes it ain't what you understand and it ain't what you know it's who you know can you lift your hand and say praise the lord now i ran to race and it when we talk about agony when you're preparing to run a race you know as well as i do it ain't easy sometimes you don't even want to show up you don't want to show up to the track you don't want to do what the coach asks you to do but you got to stay committed it's got to stay committed well i had a coach when i was about i think i was 13 12 i was going to play i was in the all-star baseball game and i had a track meet on saturday and i was running the mile run and my coach was a wonderful fella but he told me that morning we were in the state finals and if i won the state then i would go up to washington n.c and i'd run for the national east side of the country my time and the mile was five minutes and 46 seconds that's fast for a little fella that was my speed and my coach said to me said luke in this state there's a boy there that you can't beat him well that's a good coach ain't it real encouraging you can't beat this kid he's got a time but i just don't think you can hang with him but i want you to try just give it a try well i went home and told my dad he said daddy ain't really no sense of me going he said why i said the coach told me i couldn't win he said what got my dad mad because my dad wasn't like this modern stuff oh everybody gets a trophy [Music] you know that happened when got mama's involved got all them bleeding hearts involved and these women want to coach these men coach these boys i did that when i coached little league the the ymca fell came to me and said look i hate to tell you this but y'all had a championship team for four years and there's a girl that wants to play so why aren't you playing softball i said look you're the last pick she's going to end up on your team i said i'm not coaching no girl he said what am i gonna do i said send her out so you wouldn't even think we was playing baseball you thought we had track i ran them for an hour and a half run the first come back run the first come back run first round first go to second stop at second raid on me get the second round third go home i did it for an hour and a half that little girl's her mom come to me said do y'all play baseball i said yeah but we spent several weeks getting them all you know endurance and we get them all ready for baseball i don't think my daughter can handle i said there's a softball team over there she never came back i said glory to god and i coached them boys and i'll tell you something about them in a minute but my dad was a type of guy like they told me well women don't matter he said what the name of god when it don't matter why y'all keeping score somebody's winning somebody's losing and i can tell you if you stay with christ you're on the winning side i couldn't read the back of the book and we went my dad told me said you listen to me now you can beat him you can win don't you listen that coach you can win and i'm going to tell you how to do it we got to the track meet there were several coaches around there and my time was pretty fast but this particular boy he was fast had a great time and in my heart i didn't think i could beat him but my dad believed i could so i figured this one time i'm gonna listen to my dad instead the coach here's what my daddy told me he said son i want you to run with endurance and this this was a statement to me he said when you run i want you to be patient i don't ever want you to run beside him i don't ever want you to get ahead of him i want you to run three laps on his heels you make him conscious that you were there he said on that last lap you give it everything you've got you know i started that race and i stayed on that guy's back hills just running you know we were in a certain pace and he was you're getting a certain pace when you're running and he was ahead of me but i me and he he was running and he because i can do this constantly do this and i knew then i had his attention he's waiting for me to get up with him i wouldn't with three laps i stayed with her and my daddy knew if i could stay there making con he would exert more energy and he exerted all of his energy on that last round man it was like i don't know like superman came in me and i started running and i beat that kid by half a lap my coach was shocked and there was only one person in the whole audience screaming hollering and was my daddy that's my boy i knew he could do it and all i did was listen to my daddy's instruction now here's what i want to tell you our daddy came down this hour and gave us instructions he gave us a message to teach us how to win this and when ain't nobody else rooting for you jesus is rooting for you that's my boy that's my girl they can make it by the grace of god isn't that good [Applause] what happens is i want to give this to you i'm hurrying brother david i'm about to close listen christianity young people listen to me christianity is not a sprint it's a marathon so when you come out of the blocks like a lot of people do brother bowler you've seen them they'll come out of the blocks red hot sizzling running as fast as they can oh i'm a christian i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it and they don't even make it to the next revival because they think it's a sprint and what you have to realize i've seen them do it i've seen it in races take off brother they get running hard they can trying to beat the crowd they get around that bend you can watch their legs wobble a little bit they're about finished they ain't gonna make it there's no way they can make it they didn't set themselves right they didn't get in that motion that they're supposed to be in hey how you saying there's a motion with this word there's a cycle with it you're getting the holy ghost getting a spirit and you're running these tapes amen at your coach that's teaching you how to do it that's teaching how to win hey how i can overcome and what happens is this message i found out it's not for sprinters it's people who are in this for the long run how long you've been running now you said that last night you've been running how long now 40 years 35 35 i heard it when i'm 18 i'm 51. it's still as fresh as it was when i was 18 years old brother you've been raised around manhattan one day you met christ it became yours you've been running a long time a lot of elders in here been around a long time some you know i got elders in my church i tell our young people don't go ask opinions from another young person about something very serious in life most times they're going to tell you what you want to hear they won't hurt your feelings go down under them old oak trees that's been serving a god a long time don't get so haughty that you think you can't learn something i got some old oak trees in our church you know brother bill i mean some respectful men that even i today 51 year old these 81 year old men ask their opinion about things things i got to make decisions in the church what do you think about this i bounce off of them see because every men got some wisdom about it they've been around a long time some of them got gray hair some got white hair and some of them got no hair but down on the inside of that heart beats wisdom beats understanding they've been running this way a long time they know it's a marathon and they know they gotta run with endurance it's that that endurance is that sort of it's sort of that uh what we would call well i'll call it like this it's that sustained kind of running it ain't really the running that can handle everything or that can take everything it's the ideal of mastering everything as brother bannon would say perfect faith what's it do masters all what circumstances that's what it does it just keeps sometimes like the old story i remember the kid the tortoise and the hair y'all remember that and one starts out putting the other ones just gradually just making it sometimes it's sunday morning homer lockhorn his wife anybody remember sister longoria i first preached for homer i wasn't even married i'm still single she come back her homework don't leave she told me this i said yes she did homer my wife didn't tell you that yes she did she told me this and she told me she said i was still single she said you're going to get married i said one of these days they're just waiting and she said you ever heard that story about that old boy wouldn't go to church young fella about your age said he wouldn't go to church mama come in here one more and said son get up we got to go to church i don't feel like it mama come back in there a few moments later hey y'all church is about time to go to church get up gotta get ready we gotta go check mama today i don't feel like going on the third time's coming there he's turned over head on the other side of the pillar hey junior get up you got to go to church mama don't feel like you got to go to church boy you're the pastor [Music] she told that to me for my benefit god it's like the taurus sometimes you don't fight getting going it's on the flight getting out of but it's good when there's something in you that get you out of bed any good today when mama don't have to get you up but you set your own alarm you said it early enough to get up and pray and read hey that's what happens when it becomes personal becomes your sometimes you might be slow but it's that sustain and kind like sometimes like getting one foot over the other but as long as i'm still moving as long as i'm still running as long as i'm still making it sometimes i get sidetracked but something gets me back in sometime they get off something gets me back and sometimes i feel like i'm taking two steps back one step for at least i'm still fighting at least i'm still running i hope you young people listen to me yeah there's gonna be times you make mistake yes there's gonna be time you feel like you can't go another day but there's something still holding you amen i believe you saturday night something keeps holding me hey it's not me holding him it's him holding me it's not you holding him it's him holding you let me give this to you i gotta hurry here i coach well i coach baseball oh david back there they got me when i fresh come out pentecost pastor in arkansas for about three years i wish i'd stayed brother hair i wish i stayed six more months i stayed three years in arkansas and i left some my closest friends are from arkansas now but i wish i'd stayed six more months three and a half years i said why why six months what's the big deal i said cause i know i'd have been raptured about that been my three and a half years of tribulation i taught our kids through baseball i taught them the principal reason i was saying that's because david's brother is my dear friend he played softball when i came to arkansas you all know i was so legal i kicked him off the trusty board because he played softball i said that's out of the world saw the devil ain't no business no son of god got any business out there playing softball you think he quit no i quit the trustee board a few years later i had a few kids and my kids were playing baseball and they saw pictures of me out on the field and i took my oldest boys we went to the world series baseball world series and i was coaching and uh oh daryl couldn't believe it that preacher backslid kid he kicked me off a trusty board letting his boys play boys a lot of principles of life about baseball respect i had one particular boy that i coached but i taught him to win whatever you do you play to win you play hard but always keep the right attitude even if you lose you keep a winner's attitude i had a boy his name was quasi smart mouth threw his helmet throw his back i pulled him aside one day and i've always prayed with the kids and i told cousins to godzi on my team you might get away with that at home you might get away with that at school but you ain't gonna get away with it out here i build a relationship with the boy i said you're gonna say yes sir and you're gonna say no sir when umpire calls strike three you ever throw that helmet you'll never be in another game you'll set the i taught him a lot of things i said now what happened is when you get older the way you handle authority here is the way you're going to handle authority out there i tell my kids police officers to respect the police officer whatever you do i don't care if you think he's in a wrong you still respect him my boys will tell you that in a restaurant i go in if there's a police officer in there we pay for their meal don't we i make sure tell that waitress we'll get that police officer i've done that my whole life with my boys in taunton respect authority the reason i did that because i knew if they couldn't respect authority they could see they'll never respect authority they can't see like cop who's your police i pulled you over you know why i pulled you over most people lie no i know exactly why i pull you over you're speeding they're mad at a cop or pulling them over speeding every people say speed and trap that's a speeding trap what's a speeding track for if you ain't speeding oh kept the cop pulled his car up in a tree and hiding camouflage if you ain't disobeying the law don't worry about him i go down interested all the time see him tucked back in the tree go by way back and keep on going because i ain't got no problem as long as i'm not breaking the law i'm not under the law any peace opera say amen thank you joe it's true i've never had a police officer ever ever ever ever pull me over when he walks up to the window do you know why i pulled you over i always say i know it's either speeding or i've done a little something no he just ain't out there and here's what i've never had a cop do i've never had a police officer pull me over get me inside the room and say do you know how i put your no i only pulled you over not because you're doing anything wrong i wanted to tell you how of a great driver you are no law is not there to congratulate you laws there to get the law breaker and that this generation it's like you get mad because the law gets the law that's what they're there for i had one bull meal when i left homer's church a couple weeks ago by the homers and i really was going through a little country town and really wasn't paying attention got through preaching i was about seven miles over and he pulled me over and he got out of his car and i had my registration and my entrance card license i knew i was speeding he got me so i had the had him handed out like that he looked in my back seat and he's seen them suits and my briefcase my bible up in my front seat he looked up and said where are you coming from i said church and i still was holding he never taken out my hand he said he's speeding a little bit and i said yes sir i didn't even realize it didn't have an attitude toward authority he's doing his job he had every right to give me a ticket you know what he did would you slow down preacher i said yes sir i said have a good day and then i found out grace does exist during law program said is this before law during long after law you know makes a difference your attitude what's your attitude running this race let me give you a couple more and i'm done but anyways this boy named cozzy he was a smart aleck and i worked with him he kept working until i till at home his daddy started seeing cause he changed remember what i told you preach the gospel no matter what you do and if necessary use words when you run this race don't try to step by don't try to get around the route run it and run it right so i dealt with this boy you know we went to the world series and this man walks up to me he said hey you know who i am i said not really he said i'm cause he's daddy i said nice to meet you he said somebody told me you was a preacher i've coached these boys all year long and never told them what i was then one to know me as a preacher i want to know me as their coach a man is a christian he said so you're a preacher and i said yeah and he said uh i want to tell you something my boy playing for you has changed his life he started saying yes sir home and no sir home i said that's wonderful rick he said hey where are you pastor at and i said well this little place down there and i told him his little storefront we had that time there in anderson he said you mean that little hole in the wall he said when i come by that church y'all realize that what y'all's doing against the fire marshal i said well yeah you're probably right i said but we like fire around there he said how many folk y'all got i said well at that time we had about a probably 120 pushed her 20 30 pushed into that little room little a storefront there he said man you ever thought about building a church i said well i thought about it i said but you know we're not a denomination we're just an independent group he said but do you know who i am and i said no sir he said i'm one of the men down here told me the bank where he was at he said uh why don't you build yourself a church i said well right now we're still saving money money is that the issue i said yes sir he said how much you need two three million dollars i said no nothing even close he said i'll tell you what meet me at my office when we get back home and i'll have you a check ready and you build yourself a church i'm like what you got to be kidding no he said meet me he said i'll make sure the money's there he said so anyways long story short went down there man gave me the money i built our church and i thought god there's no way you could bring me in contact with a man like this and there'll not be something in this i kept trying my best way how can i tell this man not just about helping but how could i tell him about christ so i went out to eat with him i ordered at that time i drank diet coke and drank diet coke and he had a budweiser over there he was drinking i was drinking a coke and he was drinking the budweiser now when i come out of pentecost budweiser coke went no dip they both sinful since i got the holy ghost i can drink coffee and and you know diet coke but he was a sinner he was doing what he's doing i don't know what i was doing i kept trying i couldn't get to him finally one day i went down to the bank and i walked in the office they got the place where the guy would hug me like we were brothers that's the way he treated me and i said rick i want to ask you a question i said why would you give the money for my church to build a church and why would you do all this stuff for me he stopped he turned me around he said luke any man that would treat my son the way you did and any man would treat him like he's a lone boy i'd do anything for you and when he said it something dropped down in my heart it's like the holy spirit turned the light on i said rick that's what i've been trying to tell you he said what are you talking about i said you see how you want to treat me for the way i treated your son he said yeah i said that's exactly how god feels the way you treat his son is what he wants to do for you if you'll accept his son god will bless you if you accept his son god give you eternal life brother tears roll down his face never said a word to me tears but on his face i left him that day about six months later i got a call and it was rick on the phone i said hey rick how you doing he said doing good he was crying this was like on a tuesday morning i said what's wrong he said i wanted you to be the first to know i was driving down the road saw an old church i went to when i was a boy i pulled in the door was open i went down the altar i wanted you to be the first note i gave my heart to the lord jesus christ can you say praise the lord brother he's still the same his word is still the same we got to run this race and while we're running it we got to run it right we got to run it with temperance we got to run it with patience we got to run it with endurance don't ever give up i'm going to tell you why somebody's watching your run somebody's got their eye on you you're influencing somebody else by the way you run now i want to close on this thought i can't help but i got to go times times away from me you love him say amen i could go on and tell you about cloud of witnesses and all the old testament how all of them people has ran before us listen others have run before us they made it if they can make it we can make it but i want to i want to close on this one this morning i believe it'll help you i believe to help you it makes a difference when you're running this race listen to me closely as i close makes a difference who you got your eyes on he didn't say looking under brother byler looking under luke gibson looking under this guy or that guy looking unto jesus the author the originator and the finisher of your faith i'll tell you something what god started in you he's going to finish god don't start something give up he's going to finish it it makes a difference very very important where you focus your eyes listen to me closely everything i did well everything

around anybody here ever play golf okay you get back and open your eyes put your hands down we got a few you know people so hard but you notice in golf you can't hit the ball unless you get your eye on the what on the ball every sport i've ever played the coaches said luke keep your eye on the ball i coached talk kids watch the ball out of the pitcher's hand so i finally had this little fella he went to church with this but i was his pastor and he wanted to play baseball and his mama mom his mama came to me little ben would like to play ball i said dude jesus i knew i could put him in right field if i couldn't find nowhere else so i said ben you can come play ben came out and been played and played a whole year i i'd do what i officially had to do and that was getting three outs and at least one bat that means you gotta play one inning and bat one time and i did that but he was a lefty i kept working with him all year long ben watched the ball bend watch the ball he didn't know what i meant watch it out of the hand watch the rotate i tried to teach him how to hit the ball but into that year we came down this is the god truth in a championship game my wife would tell you it was the bottom of the six we were down one run bases loaded two outs guess who comes up the bat oh ben i thought god have mercy so his daddy told me something about him a week before ben's 12 years old and he told me he said did you know ben still sleeps with his mama i said really 12 years old the thing was i didn't want to let him know i did it 12 years old night i could get in there i did i was the mama's boy so i called time come here ben didn't come down the third base line he got right to me and i stood there talking to him for a minute i said ben son you all year long you ain't hit the broadside of a barn you know what i've told you all year long keep your eye on the ball keep your eye on the ball keep your i said you ain't done it yet i'm fine coach try someone tell you something

you know the batter's box he's left he's a lefty and he got up there and left him and i've never seen a kid more focused in all of my life and he was right on it son first time ever that ball came out

that right amen i've often said you know all the way from the beginning of time all the way from cain and abel from the death of cable from the very start you and i are coming to the highlight of the whole plan amen the purpose of the whole creation we're coming to the highlight of it the highlight of calvary the highlight of grace and that is that when all the redeemed of all the ages amen see our awesome god and savior the lord jesus christ when we unite with him because they can't how many knows we think they're not going to crown him without us a minute we're looking for that time called the rapture it's the great highlight of it all amen and so keep your eye on the rapture folks how many believes we need to keep your eye on christ keep it on the end because the devil sure would like

you amen i'm going to say a prayer and then amen
