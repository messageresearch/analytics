[38:12] on my heart to speak tonight that you
[38:14] would just direct my thoughts and every
[38:16] word father to to people's hearts and

[38:54] world brings what Jesus brings and what
[38:57] you bring amen you've heard the sayings
[39:01] what do you bring to the
[39:02] table amen and so that's just kind of
[39:05] the thought the Lord laid on my heart is
[39:07] what do we bring to the table amen and
[39:10] uh I guess my my thought derive from
[39:14] Brother brandom's quote talking about he
[39:16] says well if you can't do anything but
[39:18] whistle
[39:19] whistle what do you bring bring
[39:21] something Ain that right bring something
[39:24] you know amen but you know I thought
[39:26] Lord have mercy brother GL and I think
[39:28] we can do a little better than that huh
[39:30] can anybody whistle can you whistle you
[39:33] can whistle right can you whistle go
[39:37] ahead all right we got some whistling
[39:39] going on Amen praising the Lord amen so
[39:43] God bless you tonight and so this all of
[39:45] this just kind of come from stemmed off
[39:47] of that amen amen thinking about what we
[39:49] bring amen and also amen so but first I
[39:53] want to amen uh we want to talk first
[39:56] about what the world brings
[39:57] amen what Jesus brings wow we could be
[40:00] on there for a couple of weeks couldn't
[40:02] we amen and then what you and I bring
[40:04] amen and I don't know how in the world I
[40:06] can fit all of that into one service but
[40:08] we'll just start amen and we're going to
[40:12] go
[40:12] slow because Jesus is never in a hurry
[40:16] amen and so we're just going to take it
[40:18] nice and slow and and see what the Lord
[40:20] will have and we'll go as far as we can
[40:22] and then we'll pick it up Sunday but it
[40:23] is good to see everybody out tonight
[40:25] amen God bless you amen one of the
[40:27] things that we bring amen amen and is
[40:30] that's a sacrifice amen this is part of
[40:32] the last part of what I want to say but
[40:34] we bring a sacrifice and when you get in
[40:36] your car when you get ready amen for
[40:39] church and you get on that road and when
[40:41] it's dark already you're bringing
[40:43] something amen you're bringing yourself
[40:46] amen how many knows it makes a big
[40:47] difference when you're here folks I
[40:49] don't know about you but if there was
[40:50] nobody here brother Brad I'd probably
[40:52] say well brother Brad you mean you're
[40:54] the only ones I guess we'll just you
[40:55] know go home and listen to a tape for
[40:58] something you know we'd be preaching the
[41:00] four walls but God bless you you brought
[41:02] something you did something amen God
[41:04] recognizes that amen all right so let's
[41:07] just uh start H by turning our bibles if
[41:10] you will to St John
[41:13] 10 St John
[41:16] 10
[41:22] amen we for going to start with what the
[41:25] world brings what the World brings
[41:31] amen what basically we uh we know what
[41:34] the world brings is what the first Adam
[41:36] brought is that right what the first
[41:39] brought first Adam and Eve what they
[41:41] brought to us wasn't very
[41:44] nice amen wasn't very good very that
[41:47] wasn't very nice sin entered into the
[41:49] world
[41:50] amen amen
[41:53] now St John 10 and verse 10 the thief
[41:58] cometh not see he comes he brings
[42:01] something amen the devil brings
[42:03] something ain't that right the world
[42:05] brings something but for to
[42:08] steal and to
[42:10] kill and
[42:13] destroy I am come that you might have
[42:15] life and that you might have it more
[42:17] abundantly may God blessing bless this
[42:19] reading of the word you can be seated
[42:21] amen and we want to come back to that
[42:23] because that's going to be kind of where
[42:25] we come back to with when we talk about
[42:27] what Jesus brings amen I like that don't
[42:30] you Jesus right there in that verse and
[42:32] I wanted to go to that because I thought
[42:34] about what the world brings and that
[42:36] Jesus very clearly declared there that
[42:38] the enemy don't come but kill steal and
[42:42] destroy there ain't absolutely nothing
[42:45] good about what the devil
[42:46] brings what the enemy brings or what the
[42:49] world
[42:51] brings amen but what Jesus brings I come
[42:57] Jesus said I come what I bring is that
[43:01] you might have life and that you might
[43:04] have it AB more
[43:05] abundantly amen now in order to really
[43:09] understand a little bit about what the
[43:10] world gives what the world brings we
[43:13] want to go back in time so to speak and
[43:15] way back into the Old Testament to the
[43:18] smartest man ever
[43:20] lived right how many knows who that
[43:24] was Solomon he was given wisdom like you
[43:28] ain't never heard amen great wisdom
[43:33] smart
[43:34] man how many knows he was that it was a
[43:37] time I think if I'm not wrong it was
[43:39] kind of a a golden age for Israel is
[43:42] that right no Wars and all of those
[43:45] things it was a golden age if I'm not
[43:48] wrong uh he talked about a greater than
[43:51] Solomon is here he's talking about how
[43:52] that during the time of the reign of
[43:54] Solomon that everybody embrace the gift
[43:57] that got it brought to them and because
[44:00] they embraced that they were free from
[44:01] troubles and my they prospered like
[44:04] never before Solomon the richest man you
[44:07] can ever imagine I guess he was very
[44:10] very rich amen he had a lot of stuff and
[44:14] so we want to look at what Solomon said
[44:17] about the world what it
[44:19] brings
[44:21] amen Solomon if you want to go to
[44:23] Ecclesiastes 1
[44:28] Ecclesiastes one the words of the
[44:31] preacher the son of David King in
[44:35] Jerusalem wow and here he starts vanity
[44:39] of vanities saith the preacher vanity
[44:44] vanities all is
[44:51] Vanity wow isn't there something good
[44:54] here do you have to say all
[44:57] all
[45:00] everything
[45:02] amen now let's bring it to our present
[45:05] age what did our Prophet Malachi 4 say
[45:08] this world was like the very best that
[45:12] this world is is a smoldering stinking
[45:18] dump how many I want to get this to you
[45:22] that the world that you and I are living
[45:23] in it is a terrible place
[45:28] ain't much good about this
[45:30] world why do you think the preacher says
[45:32] if you love the world or the things of
[45:34] the world you you got the wrong
[45:37] affection your affection is in the wrong
[45:41] place let's look at some things that uh
[45:45] cause Solomon to say this about the
[45:48] world and it's all
[45:51] negative there's not a lot of positive
[45:53] things at all that Solomon talked about
[45:56] this world
[45:57] and why the reason we want to look at
[45:59] the reason why that he said everything's
[46:02] vanity and and so
[46:05] forth and uh so he says all is Vanity
[46:09] what prophet hath a man of all his labor
[46:12] which he taketh Under the
[46:15] Sun what prophet is
[46:18] it what do you end up with what good is
[46:22] it
[46:24] all amen one gener generation passes
[46:28] away another generation cometh amen but
[46:31] the Earth abideth forever he talks about
[46:34] the sun the Sun Also arises and the sun
[46:37] goes
[46:38] down and hateth to the place where he
[46:42] arose amen so he talks about the sun
[46:45] that's all
[46:46] vanity hey it was nice sunshine today
[46:49] but where is it it's
[46:53] gone so what good is it
[47:00] huh what good is life one generation
[47:04] comes and off you
[47:05] go the next Generation take
[47:10] place
[47:13] vanity oh let me see here I'm just going
[47:16] to take my time talks about Generations
[47:19] talks about the very
[47:21] son going back to its place and I wrote
[47:23] down here in my Bible you see because
[47:27] we love
[47:29] sunshine how many love
[47:33] sunshine hey I ain't the shame I ain't a
[47:35] shame to say when I was down in Florida
[47:37] I sat back in a chair and I just basp in
[47:40] the sun I
[47:41] said this nice I like this you
[47:45] know that's right enjoy the sun nice
[47:48] warm sunshine while y'all were freezing
[47:51] up
[47:53] here but you guess what where's it at
[47:56] that come back to the
[47:58] cold that's right and the sun comes up
[48:02] and he
[48:06] goes you see when we we're longing for
[48:09] the sun to
[48:11] shine but constantly right that's why
[48:15] they even had an inspiration of a song
[48:17] says the sun will never go down in that
[48:20] City the sun it will never go
[48:24] down I mean there going to be no setting
[48:26] Sun's over there it'll shine Eternal
[48:30] bright and
[48:31] fair that's what we long for is that
[48:34] Eternal
[48:39] son Paul in First
[48:43] Corinthians I believe it
[48:48] is or second
[48:50] Corinthians he said it this way while we
[48:53] look not at the things which are seen
[48:56] but at the things which are not seen for
[48:59] the things which are seen are
[49:04] temporal but the things which are not
[49:06] seen are Eternal so everything that you
[49:10] say is
[49:13] temporary two words one is mortality and
[49:16] the other one is temporary it's
[49:21] temporal I am looking for something
[49:24] Eternal aren't you
[49:27] amen
[49:32] amen all right so let's look at that and
[49:35] this is part of the reason that I
[49:37] believe that the great Solomon said what
[49:41] he said in this
[49:43] book all right the wind goeth towards
[49:47] the
[49:48] South and turneth about unto the north
[49:52] it whth about Contin continuously and
[49:56] the wind returneth again according to
[49:58] his
[49:59] circuit all right let me go on down here
[50:01] in verse eight All Things Are full of
[50:03] Labor man cannot utter it the eye is not
[50:07] satisfied with seeing nor the
[50:10] ear filled with hearing
[50:15] amen I got I want to do a lot of reading
[50:18] we'll come back to
[50:20] that the thing which has been it is that
[50:24] which shall be and that which is done
[50:27] is that which shall be done and there is
[50:29] no new thing under the sun is there
[50:33] anything whereof it may be said see this
[50:36] is new it hath been already of old time
[50:39] which was before
[50:41] us Amen brother Brandon when he was
[50:43] preaching on Jezebel religion he says
[50:45] you know you think you're all modern
[50:48] with your makeup and paint and stuff he
[50:50] said no that's his oldfashioned stuff
[50:54] amen Jezebel did it way back in in the
[50:56] old
[50:58] days that's oldfashioned that isn't new
[51:01] stuff that's you know modern no that's
[51:03] way back then look where it comes
[51:06] from amen there's no remembrance of the
[51:10] former things neither shall there be any
[51:12] remembrance of the things that are to
[51:14] come with those that shall come
[51:18] Hereafter in other
[51:20] words you think about your great great
[51:23] grandfather how many remembers your
[51:24] great great grandfather
[51:28] and his brothers and his
[51:31] sisters their nieces and their
[51:34] nephews none of us remember any of
[51:39] it why and we don't like that I don't
[51:42] know about you but I want a family that
[51:45] we remember
[51:48] forever I mean looking forward to
[51:51] that there won't be no passing and no go
[51:54] they're gone you think oh people will
[51:55] remember me now
[51:57] if you get lucky they might write you
[51:58] into history
[52:00] books huh and some of them will look at
[52:03] you like Abraham lincol George
[52:05] Washington and some of those but all the
[52:07] rest of aren't great enough to make it
[52:08] into the history books we just go to the
[52:11] grave and we get
[52:13] forgotten but aren't you glad that when
[52:16] God makes up his jewels he'll remember
[52:18] he puts our names down and he'll
[52:19] remember us and he'll call and we'll
[52:23] answer praise the
[52:25] Lord amen I'm glad for that amen so
[52:28] there's no more you know it it he didn't
[52:31] like that I don't like that either
[52:33] praise the
[52:34] Lord say I the preacher was King over
[52:37] Israel in Jerusalem and I gave my heart
[52:39] to seek and to search out by wisdom
[52:41] concerning all things that are done
[52:43] under the
[52:44] sun this sore travail ha God given Unto
[52:49] the Sons of men to be exercised
[52:52] thereby amen that's right how many know
[52:55] life is full of
[52:58] Trials a man that is born of a woman is
[53:02] a few days and full of
[53:06] trouble amen that's what this life is
[53:09] full of
[53:14] trouble s
[53:17] travail I have seen all the works that
[53:19] are done under the sun and behold all is
[53:22] Vanity and vexation of spirit Verse 18
[53:26] he says for in much wisdom is much grief
[53:30] and he that increases knowledge
[53:32] increases
[53:34] sorrow the more you really got to
[53:36] thinking about it and knowing how things
[53:38] really are the more sadder it makes
[53:44] you is that
[53:47] right amen
[53:50] wow that's this
[53:52] world the world that we live in it it's
[53:55] a complete compl
[53:57] disappointment
[54:01] amen complete
[54:05] disappointment you see we brought
[54:08] nothing into this world and will
[54:10] certainly not carry anything
[54:12] out you can put all the gold in there
[54:14] you want to if you have any ain't going
[54:17] to do you bit of good all
[54:20] right amen but we'll get to Jesus in a
[54:22] little bit is that all
[54:24] right amen
[54:28] Hallelujah all right so the smarter you
[54:32] get the more grief you add to yourself
[54:35] no
[54:36] wonder uh Solomon he was a very very
[54:40] smart man he had gotten a lot of wisdom
[54:43] a whole lot of understanding I think he
[54:45] understood it pretty
[54:47] good that it's really when you add it
[54:50] all up it's all a bunch of
[54:54] vanity it means
[55:00] nothing let's look at what he did he
[55:03] said here I sought in my heart chapter 2
[55:07] and verse three and I sought in my heart
[55:08] to give myself unto
[55:11] wine yet acquainted Mine Heart with
[55:13] wisdom and to lay hold on Folly till I
[55:16] might see what was that good for the
[55:18] sons of men which they should do Under
[55:21] This Heaven all the days of their life I
[55:24] made me great works of builted me houses

[55:41] pool he had a big Archard he had the
[55:44] best fruit oranges and tangerines and no
[55:48] doubt all of those good things you

[57:01] them I withheld not my heart from any
[57:04] joy for my heart rejoice in all my
[57:07] labors and this is my portion of all my
[57:11] labor and then I looked upon all the
[57:13] works that my hands had wrought and all

[57:18] behold man it was
[57:21] nice what a great
[57:24] thing listen to what he said said and
[57:27] behold all was vanity and vexation of

[59:11] sure that has been a
[59:18] nightmare amen but what did he say solom
[59:21] said all of these things I had it all I
[59:24] all he realized it still not
[59:28] satisfactory
[59:31] amen praise the Lord Brother baham says
[59:33] you know in this country there's so many
[59:35] people that's dissatisfied

[59:41] and find so much
[59:43] dissatisfaction people hardly know what
[59:45] to do amen some of them get so Disturbed
[59:49] to go down at the drugstore and purchase
[59:51] to themselves Arsenic and amen they'll
[59:53] go in the car and uh put carbon monoxide
[59:56] and kill themselves isn't that right

[1:00:00] jumping off actually blow their brains
[1:00:02] out and everything they're just
[1:00:03] unsatisfied hospitals are full of
[1:00:06] unsatisfied people the insane
[1:00:07] institutions are overrun dissatisfied
[1:00:10] they don't know what to do there seems
[1:00:12] to be something they're reaching after
[1:00:14] but they just never came come to it I
[1:00:16] hope I'm talking to a bunch of people
[1:00:18] that have come amen and have that
[1:00:20] satisfaction down in their heart the
[1:00:23] very thing that Solomon couldn't get you

[1:01:23] he realized it all fades away It's All
[1:01:27] Temporary I believe in your heart and in
[1:01:30] my heart there's a desire for things
[1:01:32] that are
[1:01:35] Eternal that's why when brother Brandon
[1:01:37] went beyond the curtain of time what did
[1:01:38] he say he says man over there is the
[1:01:40] most glorious place there is no more
[1:01:42] tomorrow there's no yesterday there's no
[1:01:45] pretty good days and pretty bad days no
[1:01:47] it's all good and it's all now it's all
[1:01:52] forever it's Eternal over there
[1:02:00] amen okay chapter
[1:02:03] 2 let me see another reason want to look
[1:02:07] at another reason why he really didn't
[1:02:09] like this
[1:02:10] world this world is not my home I'm just
[1:02:13] passing through my treasures are laid up
[1:02:16] somewhere beyond the
[1:02:18] blue
[1:02:22] amen we are so out of place here
[1:02:26] we are so out of
[1:02:32] place we're so out of place in this
[1:02:37] body I don't know this may be some Side
[1:02:39] Road here but so out of place this is
[1:02:42] just not our home this body is not my
[1:02:45] home brother
[1:02:49] Glenn on the inside when I got born
[1:02:52] again there was a man started to grow
[1:02:54] a't that right that's the the real me is
[1:02:56] on the inside and then in the inside it
[1:02:59] loves the things that are holy and
[1:03:01] righteous and pure and joy and happiness
[1:03:03] and everything else but the outside man
[1:03:05] we all know the older you get the easier
[1:03:07] it is to become
[1:03:18] blue that's right to be sad and blue
[1:03:23] because this world will give you a lot
[1:03:24] to be blue about
[1:03:26] old age having to put these on every
[1:03:31] time
[1:03:32] huh
[1:03:38] feebleness
[1:03:40] anyway I guess we used to not talk too
[1:03:43] much about going to the gym or working
[1:03:44] out but folks I'm here to tell you if I
[1:03:47] quit working out or doing something
[1:03:48] folks I feel like you might as well
[1:03:50] cover me
[1:03:52] up you
[1:03:56] I still got to run out that driveway a
[1:03:57] little bit just to get my blood pumping
[1:04:00] just to halfway feel good amen but
[1:04:03] anyway all right where was we talking
[1:04:07] about
[1:04:09] Solomon and something else I got a
[1:04:11] couple more things I want to cover with
[1:04:13] Solomon before we go
[1:04:18] on I'm going
[1:04:22] to jump to jump to chapter 3 because I
[1:04:26] mentioned a minute ago how that the one
[1:04:28] thing that Solomon realized that we are
[1:04:31] and that is in
[1:04:33] time he said to everything there is a
[1:04:35] season and a time for every purpose
[1:04:38] Under the
[1:04:40] Sun there's a time for you to be born
[1:04:43] there's a time for you to
[1:04:46] die there's a time for you to plant and
[1:04:49] a time to pluck up that which is
[1:04:52] planted A Time to Kill a time to heal
[1:04:57] a time to break down and a time to build
[1:04:59] up I don't know about you but man
[1:05:01] everything you do falls apart it ends up
[1:05:04] having to be torn
[1:05:06] down what a
[1:05:08] world that
[1:05:11] right that's why we're looking for to
[1:05:13] get out of
[1:05:17] time
[1:05:20] amen a time to weep and a time to laugh
[1:05:26] you might
[1:05:27] laugh but it won't be long and you lose
[1:05:31] a loved one or something will happen and
[1:05:33] you'll cry like a
[1:05:35] baby you might have joy unspeakable and
[1:05:38] jump up like I do
[1:05:40] sometimes but you're going to be down
[1:05:43] again you're going to be sad because
[1:05:46] you're in this
[1:05:47] world that's how it is you got your UPS
[1:05:51] you got your
[1:05:52] Downs amen you got your ends you got
[1:05:56] your what uh ins and your
[1:06:01] outs got your times that you can talk
[1:06:03] good and times that you
[1:06:05] can't times that you can remember your
[1:06:07] words and times you don't know what
[1:06:09] you're saying
[1:06:10] next a time to weep and a time to laugh
[1:06:15] time to mourn and a time to
[1:06:18] dance that's right time to Cast Away
[1:06:21] stones and a time to gather Stones what
[1:06:23] a waste of time
[1:06:28] huh that's right a time to embrace and a
[1:06:31] time to refrain from embracing a time to
[1:06:33] get and a time to lose a time to keep
[1:06:36] and a time to Cast Away time to Ren and
[1:06:38] a time to swow time to keep silent and a
[1:06:41] time to speak a time to love and a time
[1:06:44] to hate a time of war and a time of
[1:06:47] Peace oh we have peace time well enjoy
[1:06:50] it it ain't going to be long we're going
[1:06:52] to have War
[1:06:54] again so what what's the
[1:06:57] use I think that's the way Solomon
[1:07:00] felt look at
[1:07:02] it what's the use what profit hath he
[1:07:06] that worketh in that wherein he had
[1:07:10] labored I have seen the travail which
[1:07:13] God has given to the sons of men to be
[1:07:16] exercised thereby I like that my
[1:07:19] goodness he didn't say I seen the great
[1:07:22] niceness that God has given everybody to
[1:07:25] living no he says he I seen the travail
[1:07:28] that he has given the sons of men to
[1:07:30] live in and to have to be exercised by
[1:07:34] that's right how many know we're put in
[1:07:35] here you're
[1:07:36] here
[1:07:39] amen a lot of people don't want to be
[1:07:41] here boom jump off a bridge do all kind
[1:07:45] they don't want to be here in this awful
[1:07:50] world even brother brandham said if I
[1:07:52] wasn't a Christian I'd probably be a
[1:07:54] suicide case
[1:07:57] how many knows the the world was rough
[1:07:59] on brother
[1:08:00] Brandon it was so rough on the prophet
[1:08:03] of God he did put a gun to his
[1:08:06] head he experienced so much
[1:08:09] sorrow Oh he had a great time of Joy
[1:08:11] telling his life story and how he met
[1:08:13] his wife and they had a little baby

[1:12:58] judge the righteous this is in chapter
[1:13:00] 3: 18 I said in my heart concerning the
[1:13:03] estate of the sons of men that God May
[1:13:06] might manifest them and they might see
[1:13:10] that they themselves are
[1:13:12] beasts amen wow didn't brother Braham

[1:13:19] brute
[1:13:20] beast that's right without the Holy
[1:13:23] Ghost you're just a The Brute
[1:13:27] Beast
[1:13:30] my for that which bealth the sons of men
[1:13:35] befalleth
[1:13:36] beasts even one thing befalleth them as
[1:13:40] the one dieth so dieth the other yay
[1:13:43] they all have one breath so that a man
[1:13:46] hath no preeminence above a beast for
[1:13:48] all is Vanity in other words he's saying
[1:13:51] you know why can't we as humans die a
[1:13:54] little bit different than what animals
[1:13:59] do you think was a highest species but
[1:14:02] folks how many knows I won't forget even
[1:14:05] over at brother Billy's lers I think

[1:14:16] death we see the deer hit isin't that
[1:14:19] right they get hit humans get hit talk
[1:14:23] about look at the war
[1:14:25] look at the Ukraine war hundreds of
[1:14:27] thousands of people killed
[1:14:32] ruthless whether it's uh Russia or or
[1:14:35] Ukraine and they show you these videos
[1:14:37] of those little robots whatever you call
[1:14:39] them flying across there
[1:14:41] and Russian soldiers scrambling trying
[1:14:44] to get under something and basically
[1:14:46] begging for their lives and they shoot
[1:14:48] them
[1:14:49] ruthless beasts horrible
[1:14:57] amen we die like
[1:15:01] rats that's right humans die like

[1:15:18] go to one place all are of the dust and
[1:15:22] all return to the Dust
[1:15:25] just
[1:15:28] amen wherefore I perceive that there is
[1:15:31] nothing better than that a man should
[1:15:33] rejoice in his own works for that is his
[1:15:36] portion for who shall bring him to see
[1:15:39] what shall be after him different places
[1:15:42] really when it comes to this world the
[1:15:44] best you can do is enjoy the works of
[1:15:46] your hand enjoy the food enjoy
[1:15:49] life eat and drink and be merry for
[1:15:53] tomorrow you die
[1:15:55] it's the best that this world offers and
[1:15:57] how many knows that's really all the
[1:16:00] majority of the people out there do
[1:16:03] they're just worried about their
[1:16:04] finances and uh having a good life and
[1:16:06] so forth It's all they're really
[1:16:09] concerned about they're not concerned
[1:16:10] about their
[1:16:11] soul not concerned about where they're
[1:16:13] going to go after
[1:16:16] this you could have communism you could
[1:16:19] have what those people want those
[1:16:20] leftists want having everything in
[1:16:22] common all get all the money from the
[1:16:23] rich and so forth they still wouldn't be
[1:16:27] happy people aren't happy with Communism
[1:16:30] people aren't happy with with with
[1:16:32] freedom democracy and so
[1:16:36] forth there's no satisfaction seems like
[1:16:40] there's no contentment there's no
[1:16:44] fulfillment and in the Old Testament
[1:16:46] that's how it
[1:16:49] was
[1:16:52] amen my my my
[1:16:59] but I like
[1:17:02] this they lacked in the Old Testament

[1:17:08] Comfort they had no
[1:17:10] peace they had no
[1:17:13] joy they didn't have the Holy

[1:30:08] got untapped resources there's never
[1:30:10] been touched of power unlimited of God
[1:30:13] that we ought to be moving into and
[1:30:15] we're living million miles below our
[1:30:17] privileges tonight of privilege of
[1:30:18] Christians of to be enjoying I feel
[1:30:21] ashamed of myself when I look out there
[1:30:23] and see the institutions when he looked
[1:30:25] at himself can you imagine when brother
[1:30:28] brandham was coming to Christ and when
[1:30:30] he seed what he really looked like he
[1:30:32] was ashamed of
[1:30:34] himself and I think anybody that's
[1:30:36] really filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:37] realize hey you know maybe I'm not a
[1:30:39] surrendered is what I could
[1:30:41] be maybe not having given him to Full
[1:30:44] Sacrifice like I should like he deserves
[1:30:47] folks I'm here to tell you if you're
[1:30:49] going to get into the water just dive
[1:30:51] all the way in all the way in under that
[1:30:53] is the way to be be a Christian listen
[1:30:55] to what he
[1:30:56] says see the institutions the sickness
[1:30:59] the troubles that's going on right now
[1:31:00] our church ought to be walking the
[1:31:02] street Healing The Sick raising the dead
[1:31:04] casting out Devils doing signs and
[1:31:06] wonders making the whole real whole
[1:31:08] world realize that Jesus Lives that's
[1:31:10] what needs to be done so that's kind of
[1:31:13] the ambition to goal where we want to be
[1:31:15] is where God wants us to be at doing
[1:31:18] something for
[1:31:21] God Amen I don't know if you know that
[1:31:24] song brother
[1:31:26] Joshua I give myself away I give myself
[1:31:29] away so you can use me amen when you
[1:31:33] come you got to give yourself all you
[1:31:35] can do is give
[1:31:36] yourself and now when you do when you
[1:31:39] finally give yourself when we as we have
[1:31:41] no doubt we've given oursel to
[1:31:44] God Sunday uh Sunday rededicate
[1:31:48] ourselves saying we choose God we choose
[1:31:52] life we choose chose a
[1:31:55] live
[1:31:57] rededication once he does that and then
[1:32:00] he FS
[1:32:01] you then you begin to do something for
[1:32:05] God bring an offering to him be of some
[1:32:09] value bring something to the
[1:32:13] table
[1:32:16] amen what good are you what good am I
[1:32:20] for the Lord amen we have to ask
[1:32:23] ourselves that question tonight what do
[1:32:25] we
[1:32:26] bring and I won't go through it I don't
[1:32:28] have time to
[1:32:30] but I wanted to go over to
[1:32:34] uh I'm going to touch a couple
[1:32:36] scriptures anyway when Paul talked about
[1:32:39] how that each member of the body has
[1:32:41] been given a different gift God gives
[1:32:44] you something he places you in the body
[1:32:46] ain't that
[1:32:48] right and God's going to use
[1:32:50] that to do something for him
[1:32:54] see he he says there are diversities
[1:32:57] different ministrations but the same
[1:33:00] Lord he says and there are diversities
[1:33:02] of operations but the same God which
[1:33:04] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[1:33:07] of the spirit is given to every man to
[1:33:11] profit with
[1:33:12] all how many knows God loves for us to
[1:33:15] be fruit bearers he loves for us to be
[1:33:19] profitable how many wants to be a
[1:33:21] profitable Christian
[1:33:24] we don't want to serve the Lord in
[1:33:26] vain we want to give something back say
[1:33:29] God used this even he said he gives his
[1:33:32] certain servants he gives them a talent
[1:33:35] or 10 talents and so forth amen they go
[1:33:38] and win some
[1:33:39] more they multiply with it God loves
[1:33:43] when you do
[1:33:44] that
[1:33:46] amen and each one of us according to
[1:33:49] Paul have been given a gift amen
[1:33:54] of some sort we don't always KN know
[1:33:57] just what but
[1:34:01] um see God has said something in the
[1:34:03] church Apostles prophets thirdly
[1:34:05] teachers after that Miracles Gifts of
[1:34:08] healing helps governments diversities of
[1:34:11] tongues and so forth all these different
[1:34:13] things another way that Paul explained
[1:34:15] it was for as the body is one and ha one
[1:34:18] member and all members of that body
[1:34:19] being many are one body amen for by one
[1:34:23] Spirit are we all baptized into one body
[1:34:25] whether we be Jews or Gentiles fond or
[1:34:27] free for the body is not one member but
[1:34:30] any and many so he's saying it's like
[1:34:32] our body here and I was listening to a
[1:34:35] tape and brother Bram was talking about
[1:34:36] he says you know how the he was saying
[1:34:38] you you
[1:34:39] businessmen he said you know if you want
[1:34:42] a preacher call a preacher don't be go
[1:34:44] into pulpit and try to do be something
[1:34:47] that you're not God has called you to do
[1:34:49] a certain thing and then he goes to
[1:34:51] talking about all the different ones he
[1:34:53] says man people get in trouble when they
[1:34:55] try and
[1:34:56] impersonate and he made a statement he
[1:34:58] says be what God has made you and abide
[1:35:02] in the place that God has blessed
[1:35:06] you amen Bel s or Uzziah I believe it
[1:35:11] was remember he got out of his place he
[1:35:12] was the king a great man he thought he
[1:35:14] could go burn incense and 40 preachers
[1:35:16] said no that God it because he got Pride
[1:35:19] lifted up amen
[1:35:25] Amen in other words whatever God is maor
[1:35:29] a lot of times in the lot of times in
[1:35:31] the group or whatever everybody has an
[1:35:33] idea this that or the other but Abraham
[1:35:34] says a lot of times everybody wants to
[1:35:36] be a chief too many chiefs and not
[1:35:38] enough
[1:35:42] Indians amen and so you got to watch
[1:35:45] that now I want to say this as your
[1:35:47] pastor man if God blesses you and
[1:35:49] something stay in it keep doing whatever
[1:35:52] God is blessing you to
[1:35:55] do amen cuz if you don't boy you can
[1:35:59] sure find a lot of
[1:36:01] trouble
[1:36:03] amen and I'll tell you what I sometimes
[1:36:06] think of us and more how little I've
[1:36:08] done how little I've
[1:36:11] done and yet I say Lord I've done what I
[1:36:14] felt you've called me to do
[1:36:18] amen all right now so I've got here what
[1:36:23] do we bring
[1:36:28] well like when we come to church what do
[1:36:31] you

[1:36:37] with Thanksgiving in our in my heart I
[1:36:40] will enter his courts with
[1:36:42] praise amen we come to church and we
[1:36:45] bring something with us that's
