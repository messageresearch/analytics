[15:09] All my hope is in Jesus.
[15:13] I've been held by the Savior.
[15:20] I've felt fire from [singing] above
[15:26] and I've been [singing] down to the
[15:29] river,
[15:32] but I ain't the same. The prodigals
[15:35] [singing]
[15:36] return
[15:39] and all my [singing] hope is [music] in
[15:43] Jesus.
[15:46] Thank God my yesterday's

[15:53] And all my [singing and music] sins are
[15:57] forgi.
[16:00] [singing and music] And I've been washed
[16:03] by the blood.
[16:08] I'm no stranger to the prison.
[16:15] I've worn [singing and music] shackles
[16:17] and chains,
[16:21] but I've been [singing] freed and forgi.
[16:27] I'm not going back. I'll never be the
[16:31] same. That's why I'm singing. All my
[16:36] hope is [singing and music] in Jesus.
[16:39] Hallelujah. Oh, thank God. My
[16:43] yesterday's [music]
[16:44] [singing]
[16:45] gone.
[16:48] And all my sins are [singing]
[16:51] forgiven.
[16:55] and I [singing]
[16:57] washed by the sing last verse again.
[17:03] I'm no stranger to [singing]

[17:09] Oh, I've worn shackles [singing]

[17:28] I'm singing. [singing]
[17:29] All my hope is in Jesus.
[17:34] Hallelujah. Well, thank God my
[17:38] yesterday's [singing]
[17:40] gone.
[17:43] And all my sins are [singing]
[17:46] forgiven.
[17:49] [music]
[17:50] and I've been [singing] washed by the
[17:54] blood.
[17:56] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[17:57] tonight. [music]
[17:58] Aren't you thankful? You've been washed
[18:00] by the blood tonight. You're no longer a
[18:02] a slave and shackled, but you've been
[18:04] freed from your sins. And you've been
[18:06] freed and forgiven. Hallelujah. It's
[18:09] good to be in the house of the Lord
[18:10] tonight. We do have several that's out
[18:13] we want to uh hold before the Lord and
[18:15] we have several needs. So, if we could
[18:18] uh we'll just take those needs to the
[18:20] Lord. And brother Brian, would you mind
[18:21] making your way up and we'll we'll have
[18:23] you pray over these needs tonight. Uh
[18:26] want to remember continue to remember
[18:27] Sister Parish. She's uh she's doing much
[18:30] much better. She sends her greetings.
[18:31] She wants to tell everybody hi. So, hi
[18:34] from Sister Parish. And just to remember
[18:37] her in prayer. She is still suffering a
[18:39] little bit of pain and uh I think some
[18:41] tingling and nerves, nerve issues in her
[18:44] feet. So remember her in prayer tonight
[18:46] if you would. And um so u brother Steve
[18:49] says she looks really good but she just
[18:51] don't even know she's got shoes on
[18:53] sometimes. So remember her in prayer if
[18:55] you would. So brother Shawn is not
[18:57] feeling well. He's got a fever and and
[18:59] sore throat tonight. So we want to
[19:01] remember him. Also we want to remember
[19:03] brother Steve. Uh uh most of you
[19:06] probably know his heart was out of
[19:08] rhythm here a little bit ago and and he
[19:10] had to go get it uh shocked back into
[19:12] rhythm. Well, oh, Satan, come scratch it
[19:15] again. And he's out of rhythm again. So,
[19:18] uh, they're going to send him to a
[19:19] specialist and see about doing a little
[19:21] procedure to try to make sure the the
[19:24] nerves are not interfering with [music]
[19:25] each other in his heart and the the
[19:28] crossfiring
[19:29] electro electrol electrodes, I guess, in
[19:32] his heart. So, [music]
[19:33] remember him in prayer. I think you said
[19:35] it was April. They couldn't get you
[19:37] until April. [music]
[19:38] So, we're just going to believe for a
[19:40] healing before then. believe God will
[19:42] move on the scene, put him right back in
[19:43] rhythm. If he created a heart, he can
[19:45] sure fix the heart. So, we believe that.
[19:48] Remember Sister Janet tonight? Uh she
[19:51] her legs are giving her problems. She
[19:53] she had a little incident. I think a dog
[19:55] jumped up and and [music] scratched her
[19:57] leg, the one that was giving her
[19:58] trouble. So, she's she's suffering a
[20:01] little bit with that. Remember her.
[20:03] Also, we want to remember Sister Aaliyah
[20:05] and sister uh or little Hie. We want to
[20:07] remember them. [music] Halie's having
[20:09] some some nightmares and waking up in in
[20:12] a in a terrified state and screaming and
[20:15] [music] you know that's just the devil.
[20:17] That's all that is. And we call him a
[20:20] tormenter. That's because he's torments.
[20:22] But we know somebody who can who can
[20:26] push the tormentor aside. So we're going
[20:28] to rely on Jesus tonight that he would
[20:30] move on the scene. Sister Robin asked
[20:32] that we would remember her stepdad. He's
[20:34] he's going to be traveling and got to be
[20:36] coming home from Pennsylvania. Is that
[20:39] right? Massachusetts up in that area up
[20:41] north. And he's trying to get back west
[20:44] over the snowstorm that's approaching.
[20:46] So, [music]
[20:47] we need the Lord to just uh watch over
[20:49] him and help him to make it home safely.
[20:51] Uh I have a note here that says uh
[20:54] remember a co-orker uh of of theirs uh
[20:58] Melinda Howard. Her son is around 10
[21:00] years old and has been having a lot of
[21:02] health issues. His name is Landon. And
[21:05] we just want to uh hold him before the
[21:07] Lord in prayer. You know, when people
[21:09] ask you to pray, it's because they got
[21:11] confidence. And I got confidence in this
[21:13] church. And I got confidence in the
[21:15] prayers. They don't just stay here, but
[21:17] they reach the throne of heaven. So,
[21:19] [music] we'll turn the service to
[21:20] brother Brian here as he as he uh uh
[21:22] will pray over these needs and just ask
[21:24] that the Lord would intervene in a
[21:26] special way.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brothers and sisters, there's no
[21:31] way I'll be able to remember all that.
[21:33] But we [music] know that God knows our
[21:36] needs, knows our place, knows exactly
[21:39] who we are. Lord God, we're just humble,
[21:42] Lord, this night to come before your
[21:43] presence, Lord. [music]
[21:45] Knowing that you're an allseeing God,
[21:47] Lord, and you know the needs of these
[21:49] people. You see their hearts, Lord.
[21:51] [music] You see their bodies, Lord. We
[21:53] just reach out in faith, Father, to
[21:55] touch you, Lord. That you would come
[21:57] down and minister to the needs of these
[22:00] people, Lord, [music]
[22:01] these great needs they have, Lord, both
[22:03] for physical healing, Lord, maybe for
[22:06] mental touch or whatever it is, Lord,
[22:08] that you'll come and be with these
[22:10] people this night, Lord, and have your
[22:13] way for a complete delivery, Lord, from
[22:15] these afflictions. Now Lord, as we open
[22:18] this service, Lord, we desire, Father,
[22:21] to see you touch the hearts of your
[22:23] people, Lord. Be with the minister, be
[22:25] with all portions of the service, Lord.
[22:28] We pray and believe, Lord, that no one
[22:30] will leave here tonight, Lord, without
[22:32] knowing you greater than they did coming
[22:34] in, Lord. [music] We just love you,
[22:36] Lord. We bring these things to you,
[22:38] Lord. Ask you minister to the needs of
[22:40] your people, Lord. And we just simply
[22:42] want to say that we love you. In your
[22:44] precious name we pray. Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:52] Let's uh let's turn and sing that song
[22:53] if we could. The Psalms 34 song. If we
[22:56] could pull that one up while you're
[22:59] standing tonight.
[23:02] I sought the Lord
[23:06] and he answered me
[23:11] and delivered me
[23:16] from every fear.
[23:20] Those who look on him
[23:25] are radium. [singing]
[23:29] They'll [music] never be ashamed.
[23:33] They'll never [singing] be ashamed. This
[23:36] poor man. Oh, [music] this poor man
[23:39] cried.
[23:42] And the Lord heard me [singing]
[23:46] [music]
[23:47] and save me from
[23:51] my eneies.
[23:56] The [music and singing] son of God.
[23:58] Hallelujah.

[28:07] blessing on the offering tonight?
[28:21] Amen. I lean on you. We're trying to
[28:25] learn some new ones. It's been requested
[28:26] we sing some new songs. So, we're
[28:28] working on them. I'll sing them if
[28:30] you'll help me. Okay. So, we'll sing
[28:32] them. I lean on [singing] you, Lord.
[28:37] I lean on you, Lord,

[29:23] just what to do. I've got the faith
[29:27] you'll see me through to supply
[29:31] every need. I lean on you.
[29:37] Well, I've been up on
[29:39] [singing and music] the mountain where
[29:42] the sun was shining bright.
[29:45] I've been down in the lowest valley
[29:49] where the clouds were black as night.
[29:53] While I've been betrayed [music] like
[29:55] Jesus [singing]
[29:57] by a friend who wasn't true. But in the
[30:01] good times and the [music] bad times,
[30:04] Lord, I've learned to lean on you. I
[30:08] lean on you, Lord.
[30:11] I lean [singing] on you, Lord,

[30:19] [singing and music] lean on you.
[30:23] When I don't [singing] know just what to
[30:26] do, I've got the faith you'll see me
[30:29] through. To supply
[30:33] every need. I lean on you.
[30:39] Well, I've heard the battle raging and I
[30:43] prayed till the victory came. There's
[30:47] been times [music] I thought, Lord, do
[30:50] you even really know my name? But I've
[30:54] been blessed and I've been down to where
[30:58] I didn't know what to do.
[31:01] But in the times of joy and sorrow,
[31:04] Lord, I've learned I got to lean on you.
[31:08] I lean on you, Lord. [singing]
[31:12] I lean on you, Lord.
[31:16] for the things [singing]
[31:18] that I need. I lean on you.

[31:26] [music] to do, I've got the faith you'll
[31:29] see me through. To supply
[31:33] every need. I lean on you. Let's stand.
[31:37] Sing it once again. I lean on you, Lord.
[31:41] [singing]
[31:42] I lean on you, Lord,
[31:46] for the things that I need. I [singing]
[31:50] lean on you
[31:54] when I don't know just what to do. I've
[31:58] got the faith you'll see me through to
[32:02] supply
[32:04] every need. I lean on you.
[32:09] Amen. And aren't you thankful that
[32:11] you've got a shoulder you can lean on?
[32:13] No matter what you're going through,
[32:14] he's there for you.
[32:17] Amen. Certainly good to to be in the
[32:19] house of the Lord tonight. Looking
[32:21] forward to what the Lord has in store
[32:22] for us. I come expecting. I hope you
[32:24] come expecting. Our pastor, he he
[32:27] preached hard this weekend and he said
[32:29] he's been taking the last couple days to
[32:31] recover and and [music] I'm sure sister
[32:34] Donald's been just treating him like a
[32:36] king and and bringing his coffee and
[32:38] letting him rest. But you know what?
[32:40] He's he's recuperated now. So, he's
[32:42] ready to preach again. So, pull on the
[32:44] gift of the Lord tonight and and pull on
[32:46] our pastor that we might have our needs
[32:48] met tonight. Let's sing if we could turn
[32:50] the service to brother Ber as we sing
[32:52] Amazing Grace tonight. Amazing
[32:58] grace,
[33:00] how sweet [singing]
[33:03] the sound
[33:06] that saved
[33:08] a rich.
[33:16] I once
[33:19] was lost,
[33:22] but [singing and music] now
[33:28] I was blind,
[33:30] but now
[33:33] I see. [singing]
[33:38] It was [singing and music] grace
[33:41] that taught
[33:44] my heart
[33:47] to fear
[33:50] and grace [singing]
[33:52] [music]
[33:53] my fears
[33:55] relive.
[33:58] [music]

[35:05] And
[35:07] when [music] the [singing] battle's all
[35:09] over, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we
[35:13] shall [singing] wear a crown. Yes, we
[35:16] shall wear a crown. And when the
[35:20] [singing] battle's over, [music] we
[35:23] shall wear a crown. [singing]
[35:25] in the new Jerusalem.
[35:31] Where a crown,
[35:34] wear a crown,
[35:37] [singing]
[35:37] wear a bright and shining
[35:41] crown.
[35:44] And [music] when the battle's [singing]
[35:46] over, we shall wear a crown in the new
[35:52] Jerusalem.
[35:56] Hallelujah. Give him a clap offering
[35:58] tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:02] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[36:05] Good evening, everyone.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the
[36:08] Lord. Good to see everybody. Amen. Good
[36:11] to look at everybody again and be back
[36:13] home. Certainly is kind of dreary out
[36:17] there. Amen. And so, Amen. But I know
[36:21] it's supposed to get worse this weekend.
[36:22] If we got coming what they're supposed
[36:24] to, what they're saying it's supposed
[36:26] to. I don't know whether we'll have
[36:27] service Sunday or not. I hate not to,
[36:30] but I'm not going to have you going
[36:31] across icy roads either. Amen. We're
[36:34] going to pre pray the power stays on.
[36:36] Right,
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Lord? Keep the power on. Amen. Praise
[36:40] the Lord. God bless you tonight. Amen.
[36:43] It's just good to be a house of the
[36:44] Lord. And thank each one for coming out
[36:46] tonight. That'll be all for the music.
[36:49] Amen. We're going to have to crank her
[36:51] up, ain't we? Find out just what kind of
[36:53] noise she's making.
[36:56] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we had
[37:00] a good time down there, Brother Hon and
[37:02] Brother Andrews. Amen. By God's grace,
[37:04] thank you for your prayers. Amen. Amen.
[37:07] And if there's one thing that we uh we
[37:09] should know, Amen. that is that prayer
[37:12] makes a difference. How many believes
[37:14] prayer changes things? Prayer makes a
[37:16] difference. Amen. You know, we believe
[37:18] in accepting Lord, I believe what you
[37:20] did on Calvary. It's it's all finished
[37:22] and it's all finished. We do believe
[37:24] that. But yet, look at all the times
[37:26] that Jesus said, "Ask and it shall be
[37:28] given to you." Amen. Seek and you shall
[37:31] find. Knock and it shall be opened unto
[37:33] you. Amen. So, I still believe in
[37:35] asking. I still believe in prayer. Amen.
[37:38] Having fellowship with God and so forth.
[37:41] Amen. And so I don't know if brother
[37:42] Ronald will listen to this tonight and
[37:43] brother Andrew, but one thing I'll say.
[37:47] All right. Now, devil, get on out of
[37:49] here. All right.
[37:52] That sound system. See, is that if you
[37:55] don't want to start a fire, don't light
[37:57] a match.
[38:00] That place is full of fumes, man.
[38:04] It'll kill you.
[38:06] Amen. Just line and match and boom, you
[38:08] know. Oh my, you talk about easy crowd,
[38:11] kind of like y'all. Amen. Praise the
[38:13] Lord. So, we really appreciate the folks
[38:15] down there. They're certainly precious
[38:17] brothers and sisters of like faith.
[38:19] We're looking forward to being in heaven
[38:20] with them. Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[38:23] God bless you. Amen. I'm sure we got a
[38:25] lot of fumes up in here tonight, too.
[38:26] Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. So, Amen.
[38:33] I'll tell you what, you know, we
[38:36] preached about an hour down there. And
[38:38] so, but you know, I think we had close
[38:41] for what would be a midweek service,
[38:43] which they have it on Saturday night.
[38:45] Instead, we didn't get out of there till
[38:47] 10:00, right at 10:00 from 7, 8, 9, 10.
[38:50] I thought, man, I thought 9:30 was long
[38:52] here. They go to 10 on a on a night like
[38:55] that. Amen. So, but it was just
[38:56] wonderful. Amen. when the people enter
[38:58] in and worship the Lord because how many
[39:00] believe we're entering into that state
[39:03] now to where we're worshiping God. Amen.
[39:06] Really giving God glory and honor and
[39:07] praise. Amen. So tonight with the help
[39:10] of the Lord, we'll just uh not keep you
[39:12] standing too too long. Um
[39:16] I can't think of any announcements other
[39:18] than not this coming Sunday, but the
[39:19] following Sunday, we want to take up our
[39:21] first offering and maybe last. I have
[39:24] faith that it'll probably be the last
[39:26] offering for our $30,000 roof. Amen. So,
[39:30] that's not this coming Sunday, but the
[39:31] following. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[39:35] That way, we can get that taken care of.
[39:37] Amen. And uh we'll we'll need that by
[39:40] let's say uh probably wait till after
[39:44] our meetings to actually do it. You
[39:46] know, we want to make sure it's good and
[39:47] warm so they you know, go down and and
[39:51] March is usually pretty cold month yet.
[39:53] And then middle of April is when we have
[39:55] our meetings and so we'll probably wait
[39:57] until afterwards. We certainly don't
[39:58] want things tore up when we have our
[40:00] meetings. Amen. So that's the only
[40:02] announcement that I can think of. Let's
[40:04] bow our heads, go to the author before
[40:06] we open the book. Lord Jesus, we come
[40:08] before you tonight again Lord
[40:11] thanking you Lord Jesus for each soul
[40:14] that you've brought out here. And we
[40:16] also thank you for each Lord person that
[40:18] will be streaming tonight. We ask God
[40:21] that you would bless them, Lord Jesus.
[40:24] Father, may they receive something from
[40:26] you, something special, Father, Lord
[40:29] Jesus. And we just ask God that you'll
[40:31] help me to get out of the way. And Lord,
[40:34] use the gift, Lord Jesus, that you've
[40:36] placed in my life, Lord, Father, and
[40:38] just use it, Father, to minister your
[40:40] word to your people that we might be
[40:42] edified, Lord Jesus, that we might grow
[40:46] into the image of Jesus Christ. We ask
[40:49] Lord Jesus you to bless the meditation
[40:51] of our heart that which we feel you've
[40:53] laid upon our heart to minister tonight
[40:55] now for we ask it in Jesus name. Amen
[40:58] and amen. Praise the Lord. Turn your
[41:01] Bibles if you will and just try get
[41:05] started somewhere.
[41:08] Boy, these glasses are not working.
[41:11] It's all right. I got another five. So
[41:13] that's all right.
[41:15] Amen. Amen. Y'all pray for me. I'm
[41:18] praying about getting that lasacic
[41:19] surgery done. Amen. And throw these
[41:22] things in the garbage. Amen. So, that's
[41:23] what we're praying about doing. Amen.
[41:25] All right. Let's turn, if you will, and
[41:28] I think we'll go to Revelations.
[41:31] Revelations 10,
[41:40] very familiar scriptures. Most of what
[41:43] we're going to be reading and talking
[41:45] about tonight is going to be very
[41:48] familiar.
[41:50] Amen. But it's the direction I feel led
[41:52] to go. So that's how we go. Ain't that
[41:54] right?
[41:55] Revelations 10 and verse 7. But in the
[41:58] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[42:00] when he shall begin to sound, the
[42:02] mystery of God should be finished as he
[42:05] has declared to his servants the
[42:07] prophets. May God add his blessings to
[42:10] the reading of the word. You can be
[42:12] seated tonight.
[42:14] Amen. I want to say that uh Amen. We uh
[42:19] I
[42:21] feel led to in the things that we're
[42:23] going to say and some of the stories we
[42:26] want to tell. Amen. Uh it's not just
[42:30] when we preach here, it's not just for
[42:33] here. Isn't that right? I think we've
[42:35] had around average of 70 streamers or
[42:37] whatever. And so we also look at those
[42:40] who stream and being able to see it on
[42:43] the internet. We look at that as a
[42:45] channel of missionary work. Amen. Being
[42:48] able to reach out to people. Amen.
[42:50] Perhaps it can't be here. Amen. And so,
[42:53] uh, you know, we just want to try to try
[42:56] to with the help of the Lord make the
[42:58] things that we talk about as clear as
[43:00] possible. Amen. And share with the world
[43:03] what God has done in our day. Amen.
[43:06] Again,
[43:08] I just want to kind of pick up where
[43:10] we've left off. Amen. Uh and this is
[43:14] going to be tonight perhaps you remember
[43:16] when I was talking about the few
[43:18] different series that I had and and I
[43:20] wanted to preach on this day this
[43:22] scripture is fulfilled and this is going
[43:24] to kind of be that. Amen. But I want to
[43:28] reread a couple of quotes to start with.
[43:31] Amen. And then I want to after I read
[43:33] these, I want to kind of give you a u
[43:39] what I what I call a appetizer.
[43:42] How many wants an appetizer tonight? You
[43:43] anybody want to order appetizer tonight?
[43:46] All right, we got a little appetizer, a
[43:47] little something I want to say before I
[43:49] get into the message and then let's uh
[43:52] we'll just go from there. Amen. But the
[43:55] quote that I wanted to uh start with was
[43:59] Amen. And brother Brandham says, you
[44:00] know, coming into Christ is like going
[44:02] down to this great big arcade here or a
[44:06] variety store. Now, I like that variety
[44:08] store. Another place he called it a
[44:10] department store. Amen. Just a variety
[44:13] store. Amen. And so, and I look all
[44:16] around and there's everything in there.
[44:18] The shelves are all full of nice, pretty
[44:20] things. And everything that I like.
[44:25] I like that. Don't you? everything that
[44:28] you like.
[44:30] Remember a uh smoking man's filter, a
[44:34] thinking man's filter, a smoking man's
[44:36] taste. Amen. And he preaches about the
[44:39] taste that people have. Amen. How many
[44:42] knows that whatever you thirst for,
[44:44] whatever you have a taste for, wherever
[44:47] your your treasure is, that's where your
[44:50] heart will be also. So we have to ask
[44:53] ourselves what is the things that we
[44:55] like.
[44:59] How many doing right now what you like?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love coming to church. I love
[45:05] worshiping the Lord.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that you like. And he
[45:10] says they're all mine. Every one of them
[45:13] belongs to me and I can go over there
[45:15] and take what I want to.
[45:19] My message tonight is called the effects
[45:22] of Revelations 10:7 and Malachi 4 and5.
[45:27] The effects.
[45:29] Amen.
[45:31] Praise the Lord.
[45:34] And I'll just say this. One of the
[45:36] effects OF MALACHI 4 IS RIGHT HERE. I
[45:41] don't know about you, but when I was on,
[45:42] THEY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT I HAD
[45:44] EVERYTHING.
[45:46] Everything that you could ever want in
[45:48] Christ is yours.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; All things are yours.
[45:54] Amen. And somebody out there might not
[45:56] quite understand what we're trying to
[45:59] say. So I just really want to try to
[46:02] scripturalize what we would say. And in
[46:05] first Corinthians the 3r chapter and
[46:07] verse 21, it says, "Therefore let no man
[46:10] glory in men for all things are yours."
[46:15] Amen. All things are yours, whether
[46:18] palace,
[46:20] uh, Paul, Cphus, or the world or life or
[46:24] death or things present or things to
[46:28] come. They're all yours.
[46:32] How many knows we're joint hes with
[46:34] Christ? Jesus come, he's false heir to
[46:38] everything. And we're joint hes with
[46:40] Christ. And he said, "The meek shall
[46:44] inherit the earth." So we DON'T GET ALL
[46:47] EXCITED ABOUT A LITTLE 38 acres out
[46:49] there in Lewisburg. And you DON'T GET
[46:51] ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE FEW ACRES that you
[46:53] got, the nice house. Amen. The nice
[46:55] Chevys, Ford, Dodgers, or whatever it is
[46:57] that you drive. We are very, very happy
[47:01] because our neighbor in heaven
[47:04] &gt;&gt; and we are a part of this.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:09] So, I LIKE THAT BECAUSE I HERE TO TELL
[47:11] YOU WHENEVER YOU GO, YOU could just take
[47:12] this here. Amen. When you talk about a
[47:15] variety, how many know that there's a
[47:17] variety of things in here?
[47:21] &gt;&gt; A large variety of things.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:29] And Christ is our variety store. Amen.
[47:34] Let me see. I don't have it. Yeah, right
[47:37] here it is right in front of me. I'm
[47:40] about to read it and I was looking for
[47:41] it. Just read Thomas and quit talking.
[47:44] All right. And Christ is our variety
[47:46] store. For by one spirit are we all
[47:50] baptized into one big variety store.
[47:56] Brother Bram said amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Should we say amen? He said amen. Amen.
[48:03] Anything that you have need of, he will
[48:06] supply.
[48:08] If you need healing, I'll take it. You
[48:11] joy, I'll take it.
[48:14] Amen. If you need victory, I'll take it.
[48:17] It's all hanging around in great God's
[48:19] great variety store and I'm in
[48:21] possession. And you have possession of
[48:23] everything in that store when you're
[48:25] baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[48:32] We're going to take our time. Try not to
[48:35] go to 10. But if we don't have church
[48:38] this weekend, let's just make up for it
[48:40] tonight, maybe.
[48:46] Amen. How many's glad?
[48:49] Oh my. Another place he talks about, we
[48:51] ought to be the happiest people. Ain't
[48:52] that right?
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Happiest people on the face of the
[48:55] earth.
[48:57] I don't know about you, but I do not
[48:59] want to be a wannabe. Well, I want this
[49:01] and I'm want that. I wish I had this and
[49:03] I wish I had that. That's wishbone.
[49:07] Remember last time years ago I preached
[49:08] on this and I talked about if everything
[49:10] has been supplied. If he was here, he
[49:12] couldn't do anything more for you. Then
[49:14] guess what? YOU ARE WHAT YOU WANT to be.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; You are what you want to be.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE HE'S WAITING ON YOU NOW.
[49:27] AMEN.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; There ain't no more waiting on God. He's
[49:31] waiting on us.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; That's what he preached. HE CARES. DO
[49:34] YOU CARE? He said, you got to now care
[49:37] first because he cared. Now, do you
[49:40] care? God wants to see your reaction.
[49:44] How many BELIEVE THAT OVER IN
[49:45] REVELATIONS WHEN THEY ALL OF THEM ARE
[49:47] SAYING there's a great voice and the
[49:50] shout and the uh the
[49:56] I hate that I can't remember. So we just
[49:59] go to it.
[50:01] After these things, I heard a great
[50:04] voice
[50:06] of much people in heaven, saying,
[50:09] hallelujah, salvation, glory, and honor,
[50:13] and power unto the Lord our God. In
[50:18] other words, HOW MANY KNOW THAT God
[50:20] invested HIMSELF IN CALVARY? HE WENT AND
[50:24] HE PURCHASED IT. HE MADE A WAY. He paid
[50:27] for you and I. AND NOW THERE'S TO COME A
[50:31] TIME WHEN HE GETS A RETURN ON WHAT he
[50:33] did.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; How many WOULD SAY WITH ME, I AM his
[50:38] return.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; I AM HIS [screaming] RETURN. IN OTHER
[50:42] WORDS, IF HE PAID FOR SOMETHING, HE'S
[50:44] GOING TO GET SOMETHING. HIS WORD IS NOT
[50:47] GOING TO GO OUT AND BE VOID. IT'S NOT
[50:49] GOING TO COME BACK TO HIM VOID, BUT IT'S
[50:51] GOING TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IT HAS SAID
[50:53] THAT IT'S going to do.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And he's going to have
[50:59] people that take advantage, amen, of his
[51:02] grace and of his mercy and accept and
[51:05] become beneficiaries
[51:08] of Calvary.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; How many glad to be a beneficiary?
[51:12] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[51:16] All right. Now,
[51:18] something for us that I feel Lord just
[51:21] kind of I felt like he spoke to me
[51:23] today. Amen. And it felt like something
[51:25] that we need to do. Amen. This is kind
[51:28] of the appetizer before we get into the
[51:30] message. It's found in Malachi.
[51:35] Now, we know that Jesus said that if any
[51:37] man come after me, let him deny himself,
[51:40] take up his cross, and follow me. How
[51:42] many knows that if you're not willing to
[51:44] FORSAKE ALL TO FOLLOW ME, you're not
[51:47] worthy to be my disciple. Whether that's
[51:50] far, that's uh land or houses or or wife
[51:53] or husband or family.
[51:57] Come on now. Family,
[51:59] you know, it's the hardest thing. That's
[52:01] blood. But he GOD EXPECTS
[52:05] our best.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; He expects our all.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] And he really doesn't accept anything
[52:17] less.
[52:19] No, it really won't.
[52:23] And so in Malachi 1 and verse 6, we're
[52:26] going to start. A son honorth his father
[52:29] and a servant his master. If I then be a
[52:32] father, where is my honor?
[52:36] If I be A MASTER, WHERE IS my fear?
[52:45] Sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you, oh ye
[52:47] priests that despise my name, and ye
[52:49] say, "Wherein have we despised thy
[52:50] name?" YOU OFFER POLLUTED BREAD upon my
[52:53] altar, and you say, "Wherein have we
[52:56] polluted thee?" In that you say, "The
[52:58] table of the Lord is contemptable. And
[53:00] if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is
[53:03] it not evil? And if you offer the lame
[53:05] and the sick, is it not evil? Offer it
[53:07] now unto thy governor, will he be
[53:09] pleased with thee?" Amen.
[53:13] No, he won't be pleased with thee or
[53:15] accept thy person. He'd tell you to get
[53:18] on out of here, wouldn't he? How many
[53:21] when we come to church, not just church,
[53:22] BUT WHEREVER WE ARE, we ought to be
[53:25] giving God our best.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Now I pray, pray thee, beseech God, if
[53:36] he'll be gracious unto us. This has been
[53:38] by your means. Will he regard your
[53:41] person? Sayaith the Lord of hosts. Who
[53:42] is there even among you that would shut
[53:44] the doors for not? Neither do you kindle
[53:46] fire of mine under the altar. I have no
[53:49] pleasure in you, sayaeth the Lord of
[53:51] hosts. Neither will I accept an offering
[53:53] at your hand. Remember what brother Bam
[53:55] said about this that they came to church
[53:57] all the time. They did the offerings.
[53:59] They did it all, but they did it out of
[54:01] tradition AND NOT FROM THEIR HEART
[54:03] ANYMORE.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the real meaning behind IT
[54:07] ANYMORE. JUST BECOME A THING THEY DID.
[54:09] HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE COME TO
[54:11] THE HOUSE OF GOD, IT OUGHT TO BE A FRESH
[54:13] REAL thing every time.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; See, from the rising of the sun, even
[54:22] unto the going down of the same, my name
[54:24] shall be great among the Gentiles. How
[54:26] many believe that's right? That's who WE
[54:28] MAGNIFY. THAT'S WHAT WE GLORIFY. THERE'S
[54:30] NO name under heaven given whereby we
[54:32] must BE SAVED. THERE'S NO NAME THAT is
[54:35] above Jesus' name. His name is above
[54:38] every name that is named.
[54:40] And you ARE AND I ARE PART OF THE
[54:42] FULFILLMENT OF THIS SCRIPTURE. His name
[54:44] is great. Amen.
[54:47] Amen. For my name shall be great among
[54:49] the heathens, sayaith the Lord. But
[54:51] you've profane profaneed it in that ye
[54:53] say the table of the Lord is polluted
[54:54] and the fruit thereof. Even his meat is
[54:57] contemptable. Ye have SAID SO. BEHOLD,
[54:59] WHAT a weariness it is.
[55:02] Oh man, twin night again.
[55:07] Huh? I'm too tired.
[55:11] Huh?
[55:13] I'll tell you what. I I I MEANT TO PRAY,
[55:15] BUT I had I was behind on my schedule
[55:17] and I had to get to work. Ain't that
[55:20] something? How, man? I'M TELLING YOU
[55:21] WHAT, WE'LL MAKE SURE WE'RE out work on
[55:23] time. That's more important than taking
[55:25] time and making sure you're on time for
[55:27] prayer.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; That was free. I ain't even got that
[55:30] wrote down.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; But that's I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT GOD'S
[55:34] TALKING ABOUT. AIN'T YOU? AMEN. Our
[55:37] jobs. Amen. It's important IF YOU HAVE A
[55:40] JOB AND WORK FOR SOMEBODY TO BE THERE ON
[55:42] TIME. HOW MANY TRIES TO BE ON TIME ON
[55:45] HAVING A JOB?
[55:47] That's right.
[55:49] WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT RESPECT FOR YOUR
[55:51] BOSS. YOU HONOR YOUR BOSS. GOD forbid
[55:54] you don't.
[55:59] Oh, no. BUT THE LORD JUST SEEMS TO LET
[56:02] YOU SLIDE. WELL, HE'S WATCHING, FOLKS.
[56:04] He notices. HOW MANY NOTICE? HE NOTICES
[56:06] THE LITTLE THINGS THAT you do and the
[56:08] little things that you don't do.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[56:20] Well, it's coming. Maybe I better just
[56:22] say it. LIKE A WORSHIP. HOW MANY KNOWS
[56:24] THAT WHEN YOU GET OVER THERE, I MEAN, WE
[56:26] OUGHT TO GIVE GOD SOME REAL WORSHIP.
[56:30] when you get OVER THERE ACCORDING TO
[56:32] SCRIPTURES AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID AMEN
[56:34] AND OVER THERE EVERYBODY SAID AND THEY
[56:36] ALL THE WHOLE GROUP SAID HALLELUJAH amen
[56:39] praise the Lord [screaming]
[56:42] &gt;&gt; let ME ASK YOU THIS WHEN YOU GET OVER
[56:44] THERE IS IT GOING TO BE A WEIRD THING
[56:45] FOR YOU YELL OUT AMEN I ain't never done
[56:48] that before
[56:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[56:52] where'd that come from I I AIN'T NEVER
[56:54] DONE THAT IN CHURCH MORE.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; A CHRISTIAN OUGHT TO PUNCTUATE EVERY
[57:03] WORD OF GOD with a
[57:06] &gt;&gt; amen.
[57:08] Come on, people. Amen. That's what WE
[57:11] COME TO CHURCH FOR IS TO WORSHIP HIM in
[57:14] spirit AND IN TRUTH.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE TRUTH GOES FORTH, AMEN. we
[57:21] worship with a amen. Hallelujah.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; I PITY ANY PREACHERS THAT AMEN. that
[57:31] [clears throat and cough] has TO CLEAR
[57:32] HIS THROAT AFTER SOMEBODY says amen or
[57:34] or screams a little.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; No,
[57:41] it's a sickum to a really holy ghost
[57:44] preacher.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GO GET HIM. THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER.
[57:55] Did that help you any?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] So he says,
[58:04] "You have brought, listen, you have
[58:07] BROUGHT THAT WHICH WAS torn and that
[58:10] which was lame
[58:14] and that which was sick.
[58:17] Thus ye brought an offering."
[58:20] Now, let me tell you something. I'm very
[58:22] grateful for where y'all are at. And I'm
[58:24] not trying to say y'all are a bunch of
[58:26] lame, sick people bringing all kinds of
[58:27] lame things. But I am saying I'm very
[58:29] glad for where we brought us, but maybe
[58:31] we can go a little bit more higher.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe a little more.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Get into it a little more.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Sit on the edge of the seat, right?
[58:45] [laughter]
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Do like the preachers do back there
[58:49] sometimes. And preachers SAY SOMETHING
[58:51] THAT EVERYBODY LIKE THEM PREACHER STAND
[58:53] UP SAY. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
[58:55] I just CAN'T TAKE THAT SITTING DOWN. I
[58:57] GOTTA stand up to eat that food.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Means something to you.
[59:05] Praise the Lord.
[59:11] Let's not come and offer God our second
[59:15] best.
[59:18] are seconds.
[59:20] I'll tell you what, I worked like a dog
[59:22] today and I worked hard and I made my
[59:24] boss happy, but when I come to church,
[59:26] it was time to rest and fold my arm.
[59:31] No, you try to save some of that energy.
[59:35] I might as well say it. I'M THINKING
[59:37] TAKE TIME OFF A LITTLE EARLY ON
[59:39] WEDNESDAY.
[59:41] GET YOU A NAP.
[59:44] THAT WAY WHEN YOU COME TO THE HOUSE OF
[59:45] GOD, YOU'RE REFRESHED AND YOU'RE READY.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Anybody ready?
[59:52] &gt;&gt; You sound ready. You sound ready.
[59:56] [applause]
[59:57] AMEN. WHY? SACRIFICE. MAKE A LITTLE
[1:00:00] SACRIFICE. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO MAKE A
[1:00:02] SACRIFICE.
[1:00:04] AMEN. DON'T COME TO CHURCH AND OFFER THE
[1:00:06] SACRIFICE OF quietness and no smiles, no
[1:00:10] grins, no hallelujah.
[1:00:14] No praises. I DON'T WANT the lame.
[1:00:22] You know the story.
[1:00:24] Some people go to baseball game.
[1:00:27] Ain't that right? Their kid drives a
[1:00:29] home run. Something happens, man. They
[1:00:32] pull the hat plum off. The little round
[1:00:35] part of the hat stays and the rim comes
[1:00:37] down over.
[1:00:39] [laughter]
[1:00:39] THEY BECOME FOOLS. [screaming] MANIC
[1:00:42] excited
[1:00:44] they come to church. I'm not an
[1:00:46] emotional person.
[1:00:51] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU BETTER
[1:00:53] BECOME AN EMOTIONAL PERSON. DON'T BE SO
[1:00:56] ex
[1:00:58] don't give the devil OR THE WORLD OR
[1:00:59] YOUR PLEASURES SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT
[1:01:02] YOU GIVE GOD. GOD'S WATCHING.
[1:01:06] [applause]
[1:01:11] GOD NOTICES THESE THINGS.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANTS THIS CHURCH TO COME UP TO
[1:01:18] A HIGHER LEVEL?
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; WELL, then that means you
[1:01:24] means you need to come up to a higher
[1:01:26] level. Oh, no. Don't just sit THERE AND
[1:01:28] SAY, "YEAH, THE CHURCH DOES, BUT I DON'T
[1:01:30] KNOW that it's going to be me." No.
[1:01:32] Uh-uh. [screaming]
[1:01:32] You come up to a HIGHER LEVEL. YOU START
[1:01:36] OFFERING GOD THE BEST.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; I never forget WHEN I'D SHOOT A BIG OLD
[1:01:43] BUCK. AMEN. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'D
[1:01:46] RUN TO THE HOUSE. I'D RUN BACK TO I GOT
[1:01:48] HIM. I GOT HIM. I SAID, I'M VICTORIOUS.
[1:01:50] I'M VICTORIOUS.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; HEY, IF I CAN DO THAT FOR A LITTLE OLD
[1:01:54] DEER.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE GOD OF HEAVEN THAT SAVED
[1:01:58] MY SOUL [screaming] AND FILLED ME WITH
[1:02:00] THE HOLY GHOST? AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO BE
[1:02:02] ABLE TO do a LITTLE JIG FOR GOD.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:09] WE DON'T NEED THAT SECOND STUFF. DON'T
[1:02:11] DO IT. AMEN. When it comes to our
[1:02:14] hunting equipment, we got to have the
[1:02:16] best.
[1:02:18] Ain't that right? That's right. I got to
[1:02:21] have that $2,000
[1:02:24] vi not viper.
[1:02:29] What is it, Micah? What's my crossbow
[1:02:32] named?
[1:02:33] Raven, thank you very much. That's
[1:02:36] right. A raven that'll Amen. IT SHOOT
[1:02:39] 100 YARDS AND IT'LL HIT A 3/4 INCH HIGH
[1:02:42] AND A 3/4 inch [snorts] to the left at
[1:02:44] 100 yards. That's further than you can
[1:02:46] see probably.
[1:02:48] Huh? We got to have the best. You know
[1:02:51] what the most expensive meat there is?
[1:02:54] The most expensive meat that I know of
[1:02:56] is venison.
[1:03:02] It's expensive now.
[1:03:07] That's right. I PROBABLY SPENT 800 BUCKS
[1:03:09] ON SOME cameras this year.
[1:03:16] Did I shoot a deer? [laughter] I don't
[1:03:17] think I even shot it here.
[1:03:22] Oh my. But ain't that right? We'll do
[1:03:25] all of that. Then we come to the house
[1:03:28] of God and buddy, our wallets close up.
[1:03:34] I got to watch my money. I gota watch my
[1:03:37] offering.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; $2, $5.
[1:03:42] Spend $1,000 or so for something else.
[1:03:46] What? Come and give God your second. No.
[1:03:49] How many believe God wants your first?
[1:03:52] Amen.
[1:03:56] Praise the Lord. Hunting equipment.
[1:04:00] Amen. Our jobs. Amen. We'll spend
[1:04:06] endless hours. Is that right? To make
[1:04:08] our business a success.
[1:04:12] Endless hours. AND A COUPLE HOURS A
[1:04:15] WEEK.
[1:04:16] COUPLE HOURS A WEEK. MAYBE IT takes four
[1:04:19] hours to get here and go back home.
[1:04:23] Isn't that right? Twice. That's eight
[1:04:26] hours out of how many in a week? It's a
[1:04:29] whole lot, isn't it?
[1:04:34] Well, I just can't do it, Brother Ber.
[1:04:36] No, no, no. You don't want to.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you wanted to, you could.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; You would make a way.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; You make way. You make a way for the
[1:04:53] things that you like
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT'S A TREASURE TO YOU. YOU MAKE A
[1:04:58] WAY.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE NEED TO MAKE A WAY FOR
[1:05:03] GOD MORE. IF YOU WANT MORE OF GOD,
[1:05:05] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE HIM MORE of
[1:05:07] you.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that when streamers
[1:05:18] are watching,
[1:05:20] I believe when THEY'RE WATCHING, THEY
[1:05:22] OUGHT TO SEE a preacher.
[1:05:25] Amen. WHEN THEY SEE THE PREACHER,
[1:05:26] THEY'RE SEEING A PREACHER THAT IS
[1:05:28] PREACHING IT THE WAY IT ought to be
[1:05:31] preached.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, it might not, THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE IT
[1:05:40] REAL WELL. A LOT OF TIMES THE THING THAT
[1:05:42] SAY WE DON'T LIKE REAL WELL, BUT that's
[1:05:44] just about the right kind of preaching.
[1:05:47] HELLO TO GET US ON OUR TOES because it's
[1:05:50] so easy to backslide. It's so easy to
[1:05:53] become calm. It's so easy.
[1:05:57] BUT I THANK THE HOLY SPIRIT TONIGHT THAT
[1:06:00] HE WAKES US BACK UP AGAIN. AREN'T YOU
[1:06:02] GLAD THAT he us GIVES US A LITTLE
[1:06:06] SPANKING? AMEN. AND SAID, "LOOK, YOU CAN
[1:06:07] DO BETTER THAN THAT. [applause]
[1:06:12] Can't keep going on doing the same thing
[1:06:14] expecting different results unless
[1:06:16] you're crazy.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the STREAMER STREAMS, GUESS
[1:06:22] WHAT? THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE the
[1:06:25] real kind of worship.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; The way that people worship.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
[1:06:34] AMEN. WHEN THE PREACHER'S PREACHING, THE
[1:06:36] WORD'S GOING FORTH and everything's
[1:06:38] quiet.
[1:06:40] No. No amens, no hallelujah.
[1:06:43] That's not what they ought to see.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; No, they ought to be able to hear amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; THE STREAMERS OUGHT TO BE SAYING AMEN.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Your wife ought to be able to hear you
[1:06:59] say amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Your husband ought to be able to hear
[1:07:03] you say amen. That's right. It shouldn't
[1:07:06] be awkward. It shouldn't be weird. It
[1:07:08] should be perfectly normal.
[1:07:10] YOUR KIDS OUGHT TO JOIN RIGHT IN THERE.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; You ought to get THEM ALL DOWN BESIDE
[1:07:15] THE COUCH THERE AND SIT down and really
[1:07:17] stream it.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Instead of eating that peanut butter
[1:07:21] crackers and soup and steak and salad,
[1:07:24] WHATEVER ELSE YOU'RE CHOWING DOWN while
[1:07:26] you're listening to A SERVICE, GIVE GOD
[1:07:28] SOME GLORY. GIVE HIM SOME RESPECT AND
[1:07:30] SAY, "LET'S HAVE SOME REVERENCE FOR THE
[1:07:32] WORD OF GOD GOING FORWARD." WE DON'T
[1:07:34] HAVE A BUNCH OF SOUPS AND STUFF UP IN
[1:07:36] HERE. [applause]
[1:07:40] WE DON'T CARRY NO DRINKS IN HERE. We
[1:07:43] don't carry on with business in here.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] Praise be to God.
[1:07:52] God wants your best.
[1:07:56] You can only GIVE YOUR BEST BY being
[1:08:00] sincere,
[1:08:02] honest. Ain't that right?
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And being dedicated. You got to be
[1:08:08] dedicated to God. THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS.
[1:08:11] [snorts]
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:17] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:19] All right. So that was just what I felt
[1:08:22] led of the spirit to say concerning not
[1:08:26] letting things become common, not
[1:08:29] getting lukewarm,
[1:08:31] and not offering anything else that you
[1:08:34] do
[1:08:35] more glory than what you give God,
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; more respect or time than what you give
[1:08:41] God.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And I hope I never have to say that
[1:08:45] again. I hope that changes us and we can
[1:08:48] say from this moment on from what
[1:08:51] brother Ber said tonight because I know
[1:08:52] it's the word of God even Jesus said you
[1:08:55] can't love anything else more than what
[1:08:57] you love me I want all your strength you
[1:08:59] got to love God with all your heart all
[1:09:01] your mind all your strength and all your
[1:09:03] soul all that's within you God wants
[1:09:06] that we are to meditate upon him day and
[1:09:10] night
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; amen and then you will have good
[1:09:14] successmen Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. As I as I just in the last couple
[1:09:18] of weeks, I guess, Amen. begin to ponder
[1:09:20] the things and looked at these things
[1:09:22] again and look at Revelation 10:7, look
[1:09:25] at Malachi 4, I REALIZE WHAT REALLY HAS
[1:09:29] HAPPENED, WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON AND
[1:09:32] WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR GENERATION.
[1:09:35] Cuz you SEE WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[1:09:37] YOU KNOW, WE OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST
[1:09:38] PEOPLE ON THE FACE of the earth. And he
[1:09:40] said, "Because we see THE RESURRECTED
[1:09:45] CHRIST OF THE 2,000 YEARS AGO HERE AMONG
[1:09:49] US, DOING THE SAME things that
[1:09:52] [screaming] he did, PROVING HIMSELF
[1:09:54] ALIVE." AND THAT'S WHY WE OUGHT TO BE
[1:09:56] THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN
[1:09:59] SOME ISMS. WE'RE NOT IN SOME DEAD
[1:10:01] CHURCHES ANYMORE. NO, WE'RE [screaming]
[1:10:03] A PART OF THE LIVING CHURCH, THE LIVING
[1:10:05] CHRIST.
[1:10:10] AMEN.
[1:10:12] THE EFFECTS OF MALACHI 4,
[1:10:17] which we need to read.
[1:10:25] Oh, aren't you glad for Malachi 4?
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for Revelation 10:7?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to look at some of the
[1:10:33] things that that did for us.
[1:10:37] Amen. Malachi 4 says, "Behold, a day
[1:10:39] cometh that shall burn as in oven, and
[1:10:42] all the proud, and all that DO WICKEDLY
[1:10:43] SHALL BE STUBBLE, and the DAY THAT
[1:10:46] COMETH SHALL BURN THEM UP, says the Lord
[1:10:48] of hosts." I was just reading today
[1:10:51] studying. Brother Bram says he believed
[1:10:52] that the whole United States is going to
[1:10:54] be nothing but ashes. That whole United
[1:10:56] States.
[1:10:58] And I thought, my my my.
[1:11:01] So, I'm going to give you some advice.
[1:11:04] If you are in the tribulation period, go
[1:11:06] to Canada.
[1:11:10] Go to Europe.
[1:11:12] Go somewhere else cuz you're not safe
[1:11:15] here. [laughter]
[1:11:20] I don't know. You know, he talked about
[1:11:22] we know the whole world's going to burn
[1:11:23] eventually. Isn't that right? The whole
[1:11:25] world's going on fire. So, it's not
[1:11:27] going to be a safe place. You might have
[1:11:28] a couple more years. I don't know just
[1:11:30] how it'll all go. But I'm here to tell
[1:11:32] you, if you're here in that time, you
[1:11:34] know what you got coming. You got a fire
[1:11:37] coming.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; There is a fire coming. There is a fire
[1:11:42] coming. Thus saith the scripture,
[1:11:44] there's a fire coming.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they shall be stubble in the
[1:11:53] day that cometh shall burn them up,
[1:11:55] sayaith the Lord of hosts. And it shall
[1:11:57] leave them neither root nor branch.
[1:12:01] Amen. Praise the Lord. BROTHER BAM SAYS
[1:12:04] WHEN THAT FIRE COMES, he's going to burn
[1:12:06] all of the germs and all of the sickness
[1:12:08] and all of the diseases and EVERYTHING
[1:12:10] ELSE. IT'S ALL GOING TO BE BURNT.
[1:12:13] ANNIHILATED. JUST BURNT.
[1:12:16] But I like this. The world's going TO BE
[1:12:19] BURNT. BUT
[1:12:22] somebody say
[1:12:24] but.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; How many glad for the butt. That's
[1:12:28] right. Amen. But unto you that fear my
[1:12:32] name
[1:12:34] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:12:37] with healing in his wings.
[1:12:41] How many believe he did that? He rose.
[1:12:43] AMEN. WITH HEALING IN his wings.
[1:12:46] BUT SAYS, "WHAT MAKES US SO HAPPY TO SEE
[1:12:49] THE GREAT SIGNS AND WONDERS, THE GREAT
[1:12:52] POWERS OF GOD OF PEOPLE GETTING HEALED,
[1:12:54] THE BLIND EYES COMING OPEN,
[1:12:58] the dead RAISED
[1:13:00] IN OUR GENERATION."
[1:13:04] YOU MIGHT NOT HEAR NOTHING ELSE FROM
[1:13:06] THIS PREACHER. YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTHING
[1:13:08] ELSE, BUT THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR. AND
[1:13:10] THAT IS THAT JESUS CHRIST CAME IN OUR
[1:13:12] DAY AND DID WHAT HE SAID THAT WE WOULD
[1:13:15] DO. THE WORKS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO
[1:13:17] ALSO. IN MY NAME, THEY'LL CAST OUT
[1:13:20] DEVILS. THEY'LL TAKE UP SERVANTS. IF
[1:13:22] THEY DRINK ANY DEADLY THING, AMEN, IT
[1:13:24] SHALL NOT HARM THEM. THEY SHALL LAY
[1:13:26] HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL
[1:13:28] RECOVER. WE'VE SEEN THE DEAD RAISED
[1:13:30] MULTIPLE TIMES. WE'VE SEEN ALL OF THESE
[1:13:32] GREAT HEALINGS TAKE PLACE IN OUR
[1:13:34] GENERATION.
[1:13:36] And I'm going to read you a couple
[1:13:37] stories here probably be yet if I had
[1:13:38] get a chance of what God has done.
[1:13:40] Because you see,
[1:13:44] we are to declare his glory among the
[1:13:48] heathen and his marvelous works among
[1:13:52] all nations. How many believe that's
[1:13:54] what WE'RE TO DO? DECLARE WHAT GOD HAS
[1:13:58] DONE,
[1:13:59] is doing, and will do,
[1:14:02] BUT ESPECIALLY WHAT HE'S DONE IN OUR
[1:14:04] GENERATION.
[1:14:06] How many believe the effects of Malachi
[1:14:08] I BELIEVE THE EFFECTS OF MALACHI 4 IS
[1:14:11] GOING TO put a bride in the rapture?
[1:14:16] I don't care HOW LONG TIME GOES. I DON'T
[1:14:18] care who doubts it. I don't care who
[1:14:20] walks away FROM IT. AMEN. THERE'S GOING
[1:14:22] TO COME A BRIDE OUT OF THIS MALACHI 4.
[1:14:25] SHE'S GOT TO BE WITHOUT SPOT AND WITHOUT
[1:14:27] WRINKLE.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:31] [snorts]
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE, HOW MANY GLAD TO
[1:14:34] SEE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING OLD AND
[1:14:36] FORMAL AND WE'RE NOT GOING INTO THE
[1:14:38] CYCLE OF DEATH. AMEN. AND ICICLES
[1:14:40] HANGING OFF OUR SAND. [screaming] NO,
[1:14:42] WE'RE GETTING HOTTER ALL THE TIME. WE'RE
[1:14:44] GETTING AWAY FROM LUKEWARMNESS.
[1:14:47] WE'RE GETTING MORE FIRED UP ALL THE
[1:14:49] TIME. WHY? IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S WHAT HE'S
[1:14:52] DOING IN YOU. IT'S WHAT HE'S DOING IN
[1:14:54] ME.
[1:14:55] HE PROMISED THAT THIS ROCK WILL NOT
[1:14:57] FALL. WE WILL NOT FALL. WE WILL NOT GO
[1:15:00] BY THAT WAY.
[1:15:05] [sighs]
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; You see, HE CAME TO CALL US OUT. HOW
[1:15:09] MANY BELIEVE GOD IN THIS GENERATION,
[1:15:11] MALACHI WAS TO CALL US OUT AND TO
[1:15:14] RESTORE US?
[1:15:17] THE EFFECTS OF MALACHI WAS TO RESTORE
[1:15:21] THE HEARTS of the children back to the
[1:15:22] fathers.
[1:15:25] Behold, verse five, behold, I will send
[1:15:27] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:15:31] of the great and dreadful day of the
[1:15:33] Lord. John the BAPTIST WAS THE
[1:15:35] ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD. This is THE
[1:15:38] GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD.
[1:15:41] Brother Bannon, when he WAS ON THE OHIO
[1:15:43] RIVER BAPTIZING THE SEVEN THINGS,
[1:15:44] PURSING A VOICE OUT OF HEAVEN, CAME AND
[1:15:46] SAID, "AMEN, AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS
[1:15:48] SENT TO FORERUN MY FIRST COMING, YOUR
[1:15:50] MESSAGE IS GOING TO FORUN MY SECOND."
[1:15:52] AND HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE
[1:15:54] EFFECTS OF MALACHI 4 IS? AMEN. IS IT'S
[1:15:57] GOING TO INTRODUCE JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.
[1:16:00] INTO THE SKIES. NOT BACK TO THE WORLD
[1:16:02] AGAIN. NOT TO THE EARTH AGAIN. NOT SET
[1:16:05] FOOT ON THE EARTH AGAIN. BUT TO TAKE US
[1:16:07] into heaven.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; IN THE SKIES. BUT ALSO Luke 17:30 THAT
[1:16:13] WE MENTION SO OFTEN. AMEN. THUS SHALL IT
[1:16:16] BE AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS of Noah, as it
[1:16:18] as it was in the days of Lot.
[1:16:20] Thus shall IT BE WHEN THE SON OF man or
[1:16:22] prophetic ministry once again is
[1:16:25] revealed.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:34] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:16:36] fathers to the children. Remember one
[1:16:38] Elijah doing two things. turn the hearts
[1:16:42] of the fathers to the children which was
[1:16:44] the with the um is Israelite fathers
[1:16:48] capus and all of them he WAS TRYING TO
[1:16:50] TURN THEM TO THE HEARTS OF THE NEW
[1:16:52] TESTAMENT THE children
[1:16:55] and then he'd have to do another work
[1:16:57] and THE HEART OF THE CHILDREN BACK TO
[1:16:59] THEIR FATHERS
[1:17:02] LEA COME AND SMITE THE EARTH WITH A
[1:17:04] curse
[1:17:06] how many believes that sooner or later
[1:17:09] each and every one of us needs to
[1:17:10] fulfill that scripture.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Our heart has been turned back
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; to restore.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; RESTORE.
[1:17:27] And I thought, YOU KNOW, WE ARE TO BE
[1:17:28] RESTORED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH,
[1:17:31] BACK TO THE BIBLE.
[1:17:34] This becomes a new book to us.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S RESTORED, IT LOOKS LIKE A NEW
[1:17:38] CAR AGAIN. WHEN THAT ENGINE'S RESTORED,
[1:17:41] IT LOOKS BRAND NEW AGAIN.
[1:17:44] AMEN. WHEN IT'S REBUILT, AMEN, IT PURR
[1:17:46] LIKE IT DID AT FIRST. THAT'S THE WAY
[1:17:49] THAT THE CHURCH IS. AMEN. IT OUT OF
[1:17:50] PRAYER LIKE THE FIRST CHURCH. BUT I WANT
[1:17:53] TO SAY THIS, WE'RE NOT JUST RESTORED
[1:17:55] BACK TO THERE, BUT WE'RE RESTORED ALL
[1:17:57] THE WAY BACK TO WHERE ADAM AND EVE WAS
[1:17:59] BEFORE THE FALL, EXCEPT FOR THIS
[1:18:02] PHYSICAL BODY. HOW MANY BELIEVE WE'VE
[1:18:04] BEEN RESTORED? THAT'S WHAT IT HAS.
[1:18:08] WOO. That's what it's done.
[1:18:12] Brought a restoration. I want to talk
[1:18:14] with the help of the Lord. Amen. On that
[1:18:18] Malachi 4 also
[1:18:21] manifested and
[1:18:24] fulfilled the scriptures
[1:18:27] of that there'll be a day that's neither
[1:18:30] light nor dark, but in the evening time
[1:18:33] it shall be light. We'll get to that in
[1:18:35] a minute.
[1:18:37] but restored.
[1:18:39] How many believes we've been restored?
[1:18:41] The food,
[1:18:43] THIS BIBLE, THE word has been restored.
[1:18:49] Now, this Bible and everything about it
[1:18:54] hasn't really changed.
[1:18:57] Luther and them, you know, they they
[1:19:00] they uh King James version, I guess King
[1:19:02] James, you know, that's what our version
[1:19:04] is it, but Luther first uh uh translated
[1:19:08] into Ger German the f the first Bible,
[1:19:11] the first thing it was done. And that's
[1:19:12] why the Amish, they'll stay with the
[1:19:14] German Bible. That's the original. They
[1:19:16] don't like this here. This is second
[1:19:17] time it was done. But Luther did it
[1:19:20] first and he did it into Germany into
[1:19:22] German. So they read high German.
[1:19:25] Well, that's fine and dandy, but guess
[1:19:28] what? We had a prophet come along and
[1:19:31] said, "This is the version you ought to
[1:19:32] keep.
[1:19:34] This is what you go with. This what he
[1:19:35] God watches over his word."
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good enough for me.
[1:19:41] Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] But what did he do? He came back and he
[1:19:53] would preach. She would preach things
[1:19:54] like, you know, that it's got to be more
[1:19:57] THAN JUST A HANDSHAKE, MORE THAN JUST
[1:19:59] CHURCH HORNING. We started BACK AND
[1:20:02] SAID, "YOU MUST be born again.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; By what spirit are we all baptized into
[1:20:09] one body and become members IN
[1:20:11] PARTICULAR, BACK TO THE ORIGINAL WORD?"
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Brings the original power.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Brings us back to where we're supposed
[1:20:20] to be. Amen.
[1:20:23] All right.
[1:20:25] Puts us back on the right foundation.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I could start here and go through the
[1:20:34] entire message for this series. Entire
[1:20:37] message.
[1:20:38] I don't know just how long we'll go, but
[1:20:41] it'll certainly be longer than tonight.
[1:20:46] Amen.
[1:20:48] You love him?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[1:20:55] remember in
[1:20:57] the Philadelphia church age, I believe
[1:20:59] it was just before Leadsia, Jesus said,
[1:21:03] "Behold, I have set before thee an open
[1:21:05] door." An open door. How many knows what
[1:21:09] the door is? In the next age, that o
[1:21:12] that door would become open.
[1:21:15] Amen. We find out that Jesus is that
[1:21:18] door.
[1:21:20] Now, Malachi 4 to me was like a window,
[1:21:23] a window that God opens.
[1:21:27] Amen. And not just a window open
[1:21:31] perhaps, but let's just say the shades
[1:21:33] are pulled back from the window.
[1:21:36] Why do you put a window in your house in
[1:21:38] the first place?
[1:21:42] To let light in.
[1:21:47] Amen. But you put a bunch of curtains
[1:21:49] over it and it don't let light in.
[1:21:57] But Malachi 4 opened up the shades.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; IT WAS SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN THE HEALINGS
[1:22:06] WERE TAKING PLACE, THE DISCERNMENT WAS
[1:22:08] GOING FORTH THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS
[1:22:10] SHINING LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
[1:22:14] AND OTHERS WOULD SAY, "WELL, I JUST
[1:22:15] DON'T BELIEVE IT. MY DENOMINATION DON'T
[1:22:18] TEACH IT AND GO BACK AND STAY IN YOUR
[1:22:21] DENOMINATION WHEN THAT VINDICATION HAS
[1:22:23] BEEN THERE. JESUS CHRIST COMES AND DOES
[1:22:25] THE VERY SAME THING THAT HE DID AT WITH
[1:22:28] THE WOMAN AT THE WELL DISCERNED HER
[1:22:29] THOUGHTS AND INTENTS OF THE HEART AND
[1:22:31] SHE SAID RAN INTO THE CITY. HE SAYS WELL
[1:22:34] NOT BEFORE SHE ran into the city he said
[1:22:36] he said we know when THE MESSIAH WHEN HE
[1:22:38] COMES HE'LL do these things. She said
[1:22:41] that the Jesus she EVEN SHE A HARLOT
[1:22:43] PROSTITUTE KNEW WHAT THE MESSA SIGN
[1:22:46] WOULD [screaming] BE.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; IS IT SAD THAT HARLOT KNEW IT BUT THIS
[1:22:52] GENERATION OF PREACHERS DIDN'T know it?
[1:22:55] THAT SAME SIGN DONE THOUSANDS OF TIME
[1:22:58] AND THEY CAN WALK AWAY FROM IT.
[1:23:01] NO. But Bam says THEY GO INTO THE
[1:23:04] BASEMENT. THEY SHUT THE DOOR AND THEY
[1:23:06] SAY THE SUN'S NOT SHINING. NO. NO. NO.
[1:23:08] THE SUN'S NOT SHINING.
[1:23:13] What if I told you
[1:23:16] it was dark outside?
[1:23:19] It's dark outside.
[1:23:21] You say, "No, brother B, it ain't dark.
[1:23:25] You go OUTSIDE AND IT'S STILL DARK. IT'S
[1:23:27] DARK."
[1:23:30] NO, it's not dark.
[1:23:32] If you wouldn't be willing to
[1:23:33] acknowledge that,
[1:23:36] I'd say there's something wrong up in
[1:23:37] the up in here. Few screws loose.
[1:23:44] I believe Brother Bam said there's
[1:23:45] something mentally wrong with people.
[1:23:48] There's some, let me say this both here
[1:23:50] and out there. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
[1:23:53] WITH SOMEBODY THAT WILL NOT accept
[1:23:56] proof.
[1:24:01] won't accept proof.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO MANY TIMES THE PROPHET CAME
[1:24:10] SAY NOW IF I'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH IT'LL
[1:24:11] LINE UP THE WORD IF JESUS CHRIST IF HE
[1:24:14] DON'T BACK IT UP YOU AIN'T GOT TO
[1:24:15] BELIEVE IT BUT IF HE'LL come and that's
[1:24:18] what he came in one place he says you
[1:24:20] know you know there's a lot of heathens
[1:24:21] and so forth that can't make the word of
[1:24:23] God live he says but God's helped me to
[1:24:26] be able to show the world that Jesus
[1:24:27] Christ is alive.
[1:24:30] that he's alive,
[1:24:32] that he's resurrected, he's among us.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS LIGHT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT LIGHT
[1:24:40] WAS. LIGHT WAS WHEN WHEN THE PROPHET OF
[1:24:43] GOD WOULD COME AND HE WOULD TAKE, I
[1:24:45] MEAN, those things like Malach OR UH
[1:24:49] MATTHEW 28 OF THE WATER BAPTISM AND HE
[1:24:52] BRING TO LIGHT JUST WHAT REALLY THE NAME
[1:24:54] OF THE FATHER, SON, and the holy ghost
[1:24:56] is.
[1:24:59] AND THEN JESUS CHRIST SO MANY TIME WOULD
[1:25:01] COME AND PROVE AND VINDICATE IT. And he
[1:25:04] says that's what gives us joy to know
[1:25:07] that Jesus Christ backs up his word.
[1:25:10] Amen. And he's the same yesterday,
[1:25:13] today, and forever.
[1:25:17] Let's look at this light for a minute.
[1:25:19] Now, we could take the thought of light
[1:25:21] for for a long time, but we'll try to
[1:25:24] just find what the Lord would want us to
[1:25:26] say. And uh
[1:25:29] I'm going to skip over. Well, no, I'm
[1:25:32] not
[1:25:35] this light that Malachi 4 brought.
[1:25:38] And I think the uh
[1:25:42] Zechariah 14 is where it talks about
[1:25:46] Zechariah 14 and six. I don't know if
[1:25:50] you have that or not.
[1:25:54] I didn't put a sticker in here.
[1:25:58] Zachchariah.
[1:26:00] Zephaniah. Zachchariah. Just before
[1:26:02] Malachi, isn't it?
[1:26:07] That's Zephaniah.
[1:26:13] I hope this is the right scripture.
[1:26:26] Yeah.
[1:26:29] In Zechariah 14, I do have a sticker.
[1:26:31] Zechariah 14:6 says, "And it shall come
[1:26:33] to pass in that day that the light shall
[1:26:37] not be clear nor dark.
[1:26:40] But it shall be one day which shall be
[1:26:42] known to the Lord, not day nor night,
[1:26:46] BUT IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT at
[1:26:48] evening time it shall be light.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; David said, "Thy word is a lamp unto my
[1:26:58] feet, a light unto my trapine path."
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that the word is light.
[1:27:08] And how MANY KNOWS JESUS WAS THE WORD?
[1:27:10] In the beginning was the word. The word
[1:27:12] was with God. Amen. And in VERSE 12 IT
[1:27:15] SAYS the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:27:17] among us.
[1:27:19] And in him was life. How many believe
[1:27:21] that in Christ in Jesus was life and his
[1:27:24] life was the light of men. Jesus said if
[1:27:29] you cannot believe me believe my works.
[1:27:33] What the life that it is. How many knows
[1:27:34] that our life speaks louder than our
[1:27:37] words do?
[1:27:39] Our life is light. Jesus says, "I'm the
[1:27:42] light of the world." And he also said,
[1:27:44] "Ye are the light of the world."
[1:27:47] How many believes we're the light?
[1:27:52] We are the effects of Malachi 4. We are
[1:27:56] the effects OF REVELATIONS 10:7.
[1:27:59] In the days of THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH
[1:28:01] ANGEL, WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN to sound, the
[1:28:04] whole mystery of God should be finished
[1:28:07] as he has DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS THE
[1:28:09] PROPHETS.
[1:28:11] HOW MANY KNOWS THAT THAT SEVENTH ANGEL
[1:28:13] MALACHI 4, THAT SEVENTH ANGEL WAS ALSO
[1:28:16] MALACHI 4, as we found out,
[1:28:19] and that angel is one that opened up the
[1:28:22] whole book OF REVELATION.
[1:28:25] HE OPENED IT up and began TO REVEAL THE
[1:28:29] CHURCH AGES,
[1:28:32] which is the first three chapters of
[1:28:34] Revelation.
[1:28:40] All right, we get into a little bit of
[1:28:42] teaching now. Is that all right?
[1:28:46] Amen. Amen. I just want to say this, the
[1:28:49] here and out there. The Bible says in
[1:28:51] Revelations 1 and3, "BLESSED IS HE that
[1:28:54] readeth and they that hear the words OF
[1:28:56] THIS PROPHECY." IN OTHER WORDS, TO BE
[1:28:59] able to understand this book of
[1:29:01] Revelation, you're a blessed person.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IF YOU AREN'T
[1:29:06] if you don't IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE
[1:29:08] REVELATION of what this is, and then
[1:29:10] most likely you're going to be deceived.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; But the mark of the beast lays in here.
[1:29:17] YOU GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MARK OF THE
[1:29:18] BEAST IS. SO YOU DON'T GET THE MARK OF
[1:29:20] THE BEAST. YOU FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW HOW
[1:29:23] THAT THE DEVIL WORKED IN THE SEALS AND
[1:29:25] IN THE CHURCH AGES.
[1:29:28] How he works and what he does.
[1:29:31] I like that scripture. Blessed is he
[1:29:33] that hear they that hear the words of
[1:29:35] this prophecy and keep those things
[1:29:37] which were written therein. For the time
[1:29:39] is at hand. And then he goes to talking
[1:29:41] about
[1:29:42] uh basically
[1:29:45] oh my you'd have to study the church age
[1:29:47] book to go through all these things
[1:29:49] where he's in the midst he was in the
[1:29:51] midst of the candlesticks one like unto
[1:29:53] the son of man clothed with a garment
[1:29:55] down to the foot g about the paps a
[1:29:57] golden girdle his head had hairs hairs
[1:30:01] white like wool [snorts] we don't have
[1:30:03] that picture up there do we amen
[1:30:07] white as snow his eyes were a flame
[1:30:09] afar. Amen. And then all all three re
[1:30:12] chapters of Revelation there talks about
[1:30:14] the church ages, everything that
[1:30:16] happened last in the last 2,000 years.
[1:30:19] Amen. But he didn't stop there. I like
[1:30:20] this because this and we'll get into
[1:30:23] this here in a minute. Um because in the
[1:30:26] fourth chapter Revelations, I've always
[1:30:28] liked this scripture because after the
[1:30:30] church ages, he says, "And after this, I
[1:30:32] looked and behold a door was open in
[1:30:35] heaven." Now, how many KNOWS THAT A DOOR
[1:30:37] is a place of entry or it's a an avenue
[1:30:40] or a channel to go from one place to the
[1:30:42] other?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Well, how many knows when Jesus
[1:30:46] came, he was the door. Amen. HE BRIDGED
[1:30:49] THE GAP. HE OPENED UP THE WAY FOR MAN TO
[1:30:53] COME BACK. AMEN. And to be UNITED WITH
[1:30:55] ALMIGHTY GOD. HE CLOSED THE CHA HE
[1:30:58] BRIDGED the chasm. Not closed it, BUT
[1:31:00] BRIDGED THE CHASM. AMEN. BETWEEN GOD and
[1:31:03] man to bring us back into fellowship
[1:31:05] with God.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; How many is glad to be in fellowship
[1:31:10] with God?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; You might be my friend today. You might
[1:31:15] not be my friend tomorrow.
[1:31:17] But I'm here to tell you, he is a friend
[1:31:20] that sticks closer than a brother.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is more precious than anybody
[1:31:26] that you'll ever associate with in this
[1:31:28] world. He's the most dearest person that
[1:31:30] you have.
[1:31:32] How many believe that to walk with him,
[1:31:34] to fellowship with him every day,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; you can sit on your couch and nobody
[1:31:39] else talk to you, but guess what? He'll
[1:31:40] talk to you. YOU CAN FELLOWSHIP WHEREVER
[1:31:43] YOU ARE.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; So he's that door. He said an open door.
[1:31:47] HE HAD AN OPEN DOOR WAS IN HEAVEN.
[1:31:50] Opened in heaven. AND THE FIRST VOICE
[1:31:52] WHICH I were heard was as the voice of a
[1:31:54] trumpet talking with with ME WHICH SAID,
[1:31:56] "COME UP HIGHER. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
[1:31:59] THINGS WHICH MUST be hereafter. How many
[1:32:02] know as IF WE CAN TRULY SAY THAT IT WAS
[1:32:04] 2,000 years later before WE EVER REALLY
[1:32:07] UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Even brother Bam said ministers, amen,
[1:32:14] theologians and everybody HAS PROBED AT
[1:32:16] IT AND COME UP WITH ALL KINDS OF
[1:32:18] CONCLUSIONS. But you and I HAVE HAD A
[1:32:21] PROPHET MESSENGER. AMEN. THAT GOD WOULD
[1:32:24] COME DOWN and say, "No, no, no, no.
[1:32:25] That's not what it is. THAT WHITE HORSE,
[1:32:28] YOU KNOW, THAT WASN'T CHRIST. THAT WAS
[1:32:29] THE ANTICHRIST. He was about to make a
[1:32:32] mistake.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THAT? YOU AIN'T GOT
[1:32:36] TO WORRY. YOU AIN'T GOT TO YOU AIN'T GOT
[1:32:38] TO WORRY.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; God is good, isn't he?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:53] So, he goes there and he shows us. Amen.
[1:32:56] He begin to show us. What did he show?
[1:32:57] He showed the the throne and one sat
[1:33:01] upon the throne. Before that we were in
[1:33:05] we were in u in in a dismal day.
[1:33:11] People that WILL BAPTIZE IN FATHER, SON,
[1:33:14] AND THE HOLY GHOST. PEOPLE THINK THERE'S
[1:33:15] THREE GODS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[1:33:17] YOU'RE STILL IN THE DARK AGES. YOU'RE
[1:33:20] STILL IN A DISMAL. YOU DON'T KNOW FOR
[1:33:21] SURE IF IT'S THREE OR THREE IN ONE, one
[1:33:23] in three, and oh my.
[1:33:27] AMEN. BUT THIS PASSAGE CAME TO TELL US
[1:33:29] THAT Jesus is God.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; I AM HE WHICH WAS DEAD AND AM ALIVE
[1:33:36] forever more and have THE KEYS OF HELL
[1:33:38] AND DEATH.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; ONE SAT ON THE THRONE. There's one God,
[1:33:44] one Lord, one faith, one baptism, ONE
[1:33:46] NAME GIVEN under heaven whereby you must
[1:33:49] be saved.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; NOT TWO.
[1:33:53] IT'S JUST ONE NAME GIVEN UNDER heaven
[1:33:55] whereby you must be saved.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE FLOODGATES BECOME OPEN.
[1:34:03] HE RESTORED US BACK TO [screaming] WHAT
[1:34:05] WE REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW GOD. AND YOU
[1:34:08] KNOW WHAT THAT WAS? REVELATION.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WE NEEDED REAL GENUINE
[1:34:13] FAITH.
[1:34:14] AMEN. IT'S GOT TO BE BY REVELATION,
[1:34:17] PERSONAL REVELATION TO YOU. IF GOD don't
[1:34:20] personally REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU YOUNG
[1:34:22] PEOPLE, AMEN, YOU HAVE A PERSONAL
[1:34:24] REVELATION. ALL YOUR MOM AND DADDY'S
[1:34:26] TEACHING won't hold you.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; IT'LL NEVER GIVE YOU PEACE. NOW, YOU'VE
[1:34:29] GOT TO HAVE THAT PERSONAL REVELATION.
[1:34:32] AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DEVILS in hell
[1:34:34] TO EVER TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I HAVE BEEN ONCE YOUNG AND
[1:34:45] NOW I AM OLD. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
[1:34:48] GOD DON'T FAIL.
[1:34:50] GOD HOLDS YOU. YOU'VE GOT A REAL
[1:34:52] EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. YOU WILL FIND OUT
[1:34:54] THAT IT ISN'T YOU HOLDING, BUT IT'S GOD
[1:34:57] HOLDING ON TO YOU. HE GIVE YOU A
[1:34:59] REVELATION. AND I CAN'T GO. HE WON'T LET
[1:35:02] ME GO.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; HE WON'T LET YOU GO.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; ANYWAY, that's another avenue I'd like
[1:35:09] to take. But let's just talk on light
[1:35:11] for just a couple more minutes. Amen.
[1:35:17] light.
[1:35:20] We all
[1:35:22] walk in the light.
[1:35:24] Such a beautyful light. Walk where the
[1:35:29] dew drops of mercy are bright.
[1:35:35] Amen. Aren't those mercy dew drops
[1:35:37] bright to know that you never did it in
[1:35:38] the first place?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; God knew you before the foundation of
[1:35:42] the world. That's some really nice dew
[1:35:44] drops. The dew drops OF MERCY ARE
[1:35:47] BRIGHT. SHINE ALL AROUND ME BY DAY and
[1:35:50] by night. IT MEANS SO MUCH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:54] AREN'T YOU GLAD TO BE A PART OF THE
[1:35:55] fulfillment
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; that in the evening time it shall be
[1:36:00] light.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; We're walking in the EVENING LIGHT.
[1:36:04] THAT'S WHY OUR CHURCH IS NAMED EVENING
[1:36:07] LIGHT TABERNACLE. AMEN. We believe in
[1:36:10] the evening light. NOT IN LUTHER'S
[1:36:13] LIGHT, NOT IN WESLEY'S LIGHT, NOT IN THE
[1:36:15] AGES GONE [screaming] BY LIGHT, BUT IN
[1:36:16] THE EVENING TIME LIGHT WHEN THE FULL
[1:36:19] REVELATION OF THE WHOLE PLAN OF GOD HAS
[1:36:22] BEEN MADE KNOWN TO OF US. AND REALIZE
[1:36:25] THAT IS HE IS THE FIRST, HE IS THE LAST,
[1:36:28] HE'S THE BEGINNING, HE'S THE END,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE PART OF THAT.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT PART OF THOSE THAT ARE
[1:36:35] PREDESTINATED UNTO CONDEMNATION. NO, WE
[1:36:37] ARE A PART OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
[1:36:39] PREDESTINATED UNTO GLORY. AMEN.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:49] AMEN.
[1:36:52] AMEN.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Anybody listening the church here
[1:36:56] tonight, I want TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[1:36:57] DON'T let this message become common TO
[1:37:00] YOU.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET IT BECOME DULL [screaming] TO
[1:37:03] YOU. DON'T LET THE THE THE THE THE WALK
[1:37:05] THAT YOU'VE GOT WITH GOD, DON'T LET IT
[1:37:07] BECOME DULL. IF IT DOES, I HOPE YOU GET
[1:37:10] SO MISERABLE UNTIL YOU CAN'T STAND IT
[1:37:12] ANYMORE.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU GET BACK DOWN TO THE ALTAR AND
[1:37:15] SAY, "GOD, I [screaming] BACKSLID. I'M
[1:37:16] NOT WHERE I OUGHT TO BE. I WANT TO BE ON
[1:37:18] FIRE FOR YOU."
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; How many believe you used to be used to
[1:37:22] coal used to co WE USED TO USE COAL OIL.
[1:37:25] AMEN. WE USED TO LIGHT A MATCH AND WE
[1:37:27] USED TO HAVE FIRE FOR OUR LIGHT. AMEN. I
[1:37:29] BELIEVE WE STILL NEED SOME OF THAT.
[1:37:31] AMEN. LET YOUR FIRE BE YOUR LIGHT.
[1:37:36] HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:40] AMEN. God is good, isn't he?
[1:37:47] Well, I'm going to skip a lot because I
[1:37:51] want to try to
[1:37:55] with the help of the Lord perhaps
[1:38:00] drive the nail in here just for a little
[1:38:02] bit
[1:38:06] because we know that this is not
[1:38:08] something
[1:38:10] that man has done.
[1:38:12] This is not something that brother
[1:38:14] Brandham did.
[1:38:16] This is something that the Lord Jesus
[1:38:18] Christ that resurrected 2,000 years ago
[1:38:21] ago did through his prophet that he sent
[1:38:25] said he would send.
[1:38:28] Amen. And I can tell you assuredly that
[1:38:31] what you do with this prophet you do to
[1:38:34] Jesus. know assuredly that what you do
[1:38:38] whether you accept or reject God's
[1:38:40] prophet is what you he that receiveth
[1:38:43] you receiveth me. Ain't that what Jesus
[1:38:45] said? He receiveth me receiveth him that
[1:38:48] sent me. And it goes vice versa. If you
[1:38:50] reject the one, you reject the other.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; You might not like like I said earlier,
[1:38:58] you might not hear nothing else, but you
[1:38:59] will hear this one thing and you'll be
[1:39:01] responsible for it. God sent a prophet
[1:39:03] in our generation to straighten this
[1:39:05] mess out and to bring light to us to get
[1:39:07] us ready for a rapture. You can believe
[1:39:10] that or you don't have to believe that.
[1:39:11] It'll be up to you. But know this,
[1:39:13] you'll answer for it someday
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; cuz he didn't do this in a corner. He
[1:39:19] did this worldwide, ALL OVER THE WORLD,
[1:39:22] SEVEN TIMES ROUND.
[1:39:25] In closing, I want to read you two
[1:39:26] stories. Would that be okay? for the
[1:39:29] sake of our listening a congregation
[1:39:31] also. Amen. Praise the Lord. You love
[1:39:34] him.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; All right. I believe this was in Durban,
[1:39:40] South Africa had 150,000 people or
[1:39:44] something like that. And he said this
[1:39:46] other missionary was saying, "Oh, that
[1:39:48] one person that he had won in 20 years,
[1:39:50] that precious jewel, that precious
[1:39:52] jewel." And if you remember, if I'm not
[1:39:54] wrong, I mean, that one Muhammad that he
[1:39:56] went over, he was carrying a certain
[1:39:58] idol or something also.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And he called him
[1:40:02] Thomas. Brother Ram said he I'm going to
[1:40:04] call you Thomas because he says, "Well,
[1:40:06] if the God Moya, the God that y'all are
[1:40:08] preaching to me, if he fails, this one
[1:40:10] won't because my daddy was being chased
[1:40:12] by a lion and he quickly set up a a a
[1:40:15] camp and got him a fire going and it
[1:40:17] protected him from the lion. So, I keep
[1:40:19] the idol." Brother Bram says, "Man, you
[1:40:22] aren't a very good hunter. You would
[1:40:23] know that that fire keeps the lion
[1:40:25] away."
[1:40:27] Amen. But he was doubting. Amen. He
[1:40:29] said, "One that one of all the years
[1:40:31] that he spent over there trying to
[1:40:33] missionary and so forth." Amen.
[1:40:37] He had been there 30 years preaching and
[1:40:39] had won one Muhammad. Brother, the
[1:40:41] Muhammad and the Hindus came from the
[1:40:42] old Mes and Persians. They don't alter.
[1:40:45] They don't change. Amen. But that real
[1:40:48] genuine Lord Jesus in action at one time
[1:40:51] he says when I [snorts] made the altar
[1:40:53] call after discernment so forth went
[1:40:55] ball ain't that right in one afternoon
[1:40:58] which I believe brother Julius I believe
[1:41:00] you'd be believe he he's way over there
[1:41:02] but 30,000 came to Christ at one time in
[1:41:05] an altar call FF Bossworth if everybody
[1:41:08] anybody ever met that saint in this
[1:41:10] modern day he says brother Bosworth yes
[1:41:13] sir I stand with that if he said I'd
[1:41:15] stand with that if I was dying this
[1:41:17] minute. And that old man stood there
[1:41:19] looking over the ground weeping. An
[1:41:21] estimated 25,000
[1:41:23] miraculous healings taking place. And I
[1:41:27] never touched one person. Just stood
[1:41:29] there and prayed for them. Seven
[1:41:32] truckloads of all kinds of sticks and
[1:41:34] stretches and things was packed off the
[1:41:37] ground where they walked RIGHT AWAY FROM
[1:41:39] THEM. 25,000.
[1:41:41] How many remembers in Bible's TIME JESUS
[1:41:43] WOULD HEAL A MULTITUDE PERHAPS?
[1:41:47] Isn't that right? Perhaps. [screaming]
[1:41:48] AND I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT IT WAS. MAYBE
[1:41:49] ONE TIME THEY had a a multitude of
[1:41:51] 5,000. I don't know that they were all
[1:41:53] healed at the time, BUT HE WOULD HAVE
[1:41:54] SOMETIMES HEAL THEM ALL, BUT HERE NEVER
[1:41:57] RECORDED PROBABLY 25,000 healings where
[1:42:00] people just
[1:42:03] brother Brand prayed and the Holy Spirit
[1:42:04] moved over them.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Can you imagine in the
[1:42:14] supernatural realm the angels that was
[1:42:16] touching them? Amen.
[1:42:19] Oh my. Think of it. And here you preach
[1:42:23] till you snuff your life out almost. And
[1:42:26] one will say, "Well, that's a pretty
[1:42:27] good message, I guess, but I don't
[1:42:29] really care to go back anymore."
[1:42:34] Ain't that America for you? Oh, your day
[1:42:37] has come. Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, your
[1:42:41] day has come
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; over in India.
[1:42:47] I'm going to tell you a couple more
[1:42:48] stories, but Abraham says if God would
[1:42:51] reveal to that little girl sitting there
[1:42:53] that she was going to walk, he says, "I
[1:42:55] bet the devil couldn't send it every He
[1:42:57] could send every demon out of hell and
[1:42:59] that wouldn't stop it."
[1:43:03] Amen. Let me tell you something. My wife
[1:43:06] had faith. She had a revelation she's
[1:43:08] not going to die.
[1:43:10] She didn't fear cancer.
[1:43:13] THOSE DEVILS AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO
[1:43:15] TAKE HER AS LONG AS SHE'S GOT A
[1:43:16] REVELATION.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL. THAT
[1:43:21] WOULDN'T STOP IT. That man sitting there
[1:43:23] in a wheel wheelchair, whoever you are,
[1:43:26] it wouldn't stop him. No, there ain't
[1:43:28] nothing can stop him. God said so. That
[1:43:30] settles it. Now in Finland, a little
[1:43:32] boy, remember brother Brandham, years
[1:43:35] before it happened told everybody to re
[1:43:37] uh write it in their Bibles that a
[1:43:40] little boy and the color and things that
[1:43:42] was going to be is going to be raised
[1:43:44] from the dead. He don't know where, he
[1:43:46] don't know who, but it happened and it
[1:43:47] happened in in Finland when they were
[1:43:49] driving down the road and there was a
[1:43:50] great big accident and a little boy
[1:43:52] laying out on the road dead. Now let's
[1:43:54] continue the story there in Finland when
[1:43:56] that little boy had been laying there on
[1:43:58] the ground there dead. I've got that
[1:44:01] document pronounced dead when went and
[1:44:05] got the mother and the father before the
[1:44:07] undertaker could take him was laying
[1:44:08] there and I come down and I said that's
[1:44:10] that little boy I seen two years ago in
[1:44:12] America there stood about 500 people the
[1:44:16] mayor of the city and I said to Mistress
[1:44:18] Isaac's interpret this and she did I
[1:44:21] said if that baby doesn't raise from the
[1:44:24] dead laying there dead every bone in his
[1:44:27] body broke wound up like that throwed
[1:44:29] him out even his little feet and things
[1:44:31] sticking through his socks, his shoes
[1:44:33] off of him and everything. If that baby
[1:44:36] isn't standing on his feet in five
[1:44:38] minutes from now, I'm a false prophet
[1:44:41] and a liar.
[1:44:43] You run me out of this country. Imagine
[1:44:47] interpreting that.
[1:44:50] I'm believing that there I'm believing
[1:44:52] this was the case where those those
[1:44:54] soldiers seen it happen and even take
[1:44:56] even mus uh Russian soldiers and Finnish
[1:44:59] guys hug each other. Amen. Listen out of
[1:45:04] this cont WHY I WAS CERTAIN THAT GOD HAD
[1:45:06] SHOWED me the vision. It has to be so
[1:45:08] there's nothing that can stop it. Amen.
[1:45:12] How many knows you prayed for it and
[1:45:13] that little boy rose up?
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; How many believes that was a great
[1:45:18] light? great light.
[1:45:22] I won't have time tonight to get into
[1:45:24] it, but the manifestation of the word of
[1:45:27] God is the light. When God manifests
[1:45:30] himself, when he manifests his love
[1:45:32] through you to somebody else, you are
[1:45:34] the light. That kindness that you show
[1:45:37] somebody, that's the light.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; When God heals somebody, that's the
[1:45:42] light. WHEN SOMEBODY FILLS THE HOLY
[1:45:43] GHOST, THAT'S THE LIGHT.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD DOES SIGNS AND WONDERS, that's
[1:45:48] the light.
[1:45:53] Amen.
[1:45:59] Send the light. Send the light.
[1:46:04] Amen.
[1:46:07] Okay. Next story. That night in India
[1:46:11] before all those people when the Rihads
[1:46:15] I guess on their pillows and the holy
[1:46:18] men sitting around sitting all around.
[1:46:20] Now remember the day before that this
[1:46:22] meeting took place all the different
[1:46:24] religions of India they took them to
[1:46:26] TOOK BROTHER BRANDHAM THROUGH THEIR
[1:46:28] temples and showed them all their all of
[1:46:31] their history and how many millions and
[1:46:33] millions how they're the greatest and
[1:46:36] how Christianity is one of the least.
[1:46:38] just kind of mocking Christianity and
[1:46:41] how great they were and everything. But
[1:46:42] Brandham listened to it and went all
[1:46:44] that. He says, "But come out tomorrow
[1:46:46] and come out to the meetings." And there
[1:46:48] they were in the meeting sitting around.
[1:46:50] And I had been in the temple of the
[1:46:52] seeks and the James that day and they
[1:46:53] made fun of Christianity. They said,
[1:46:55] "The very idea of Christ dying when they
[1:46:57] won't even kill a flea or mop a floor as
[1:46:59] they go to keep from stepping uh
[1:47:03] stepping or or or an ant." They believe
[1:47:06] in reincarnation. think it might be some
[1:47:08] of their relatives. How could you preach
[1:47:10] to them the blood sacrifice? I said,
[1:47:13] "Let God speak. That's God. Some of us
[1:47:16] has got to be some of us got to be
[1:47:18] wrong." And I picked up the Quran in one
[1:47:21] hand and the Bible in the other and I
[1:47:23] said, "Something's wrong somewhere."
[1:47:26] Can you imagine BEFORE 500,000? I
[1:47:28] BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
[1:47:30] SOMEWHERE.
[1:47:33] LORD HELP US. HOW MANY KNOW THAT'S
[1:47:35] EXACTLY THE SAME ELIJAH'S SPIRIT ON
[1:47:38] MOUNT uh Mount Carmel, I believe it is,
[1:47:40] THOSE 400 PROPHETS IN THE DAYS OF THE
[1:47:42] BIBLE SAYS, "IF YOUR GOD IS GOD, LET HIM
[1:47:46] PROVE IT.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; LET HIM COME FORTH. BRING YOUR
[1:47:49] SACRIFICE." AMEN. THEY BROUGHT THEIR
[1:47:51] SACRIFICE. AMEN. And man, they tried to
[1:47:53] get the FIRE GOING. TRIED TO BURN. IT
[1:47:55] WOULDN'T START. YOU TALK ABOUT A
[1:47:56] NON-STARTER.
[1:47:59] IT WAS A NON-STARTER.
[1:48:01] BUT AFTERWARDS, ELIJAH SAID, "BRING,
[1:48:03] BRING ME NOW SOMETHING. I WANT YOU TO
[1:48:05] DOUSE IT. DOUSE IT AGAIN. DOUSE IT
[1:48:07] AGAIN." AMEN. UNTIL IT'S FLOODED.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; WOO. That's what BROTHER BRANDON WAS
[1:48:13] THERE. AMEN. THE ELIJAH SPIRIT SAID,
[1:48:14] "NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE." HE
[1:48:17] WAS BRINGING A CHALLENGE. HE WAS OPENING
[1:48:19] UP THE EYES OF THE WORLD. AND
[1:48:21] REVELATIONS 18, THE ANGEL THAT CAME, HIS
[1:48:24] GLORY LIGHTENED [screaming] THE WHOLE
[1:48:26] EARTH. AREN'T YOU GLAD TO BE A PART OF
[1:48:28] THAT LIGHT? IT'S WORTH EVERY TIME, EVERY
[1:48:31] EFFORT, EVERY SACRIFICE WE MADE TO BE A
[1:48:33] PART OF THAT LIGHT.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Shall be light in the evening time.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:42] SOMETHING'S WRONG SOMEWHERE. LET GOD
[1:48:44] that's real speak. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:48:48] says, "About that time, they brought a
[1:48:50] blind man up there and I says, I cannot
[1:48:52] heal the man." Of course not. I said,
[1:48:54] "His name is spelled and he spells out
[1:48:56] the letters like that." That's right. I
[1:49:00] said he's a beggar. His wife's the
[1:49:02] little thin woman. He's got boys. One of
[1:49:05] them six and the other one's eight.
[1:49:07] Correct. Standing out there that mo that
[1:49:09] anoint underneath that anointing them re
[1:49:13] r a j ah rahas
[1:49:16] sitting out there them holy men said
[1:49:19] he's reading their mind. I thought I
[1:49:22] thought oh them hypocrites. Then I
[1:49:24] looked back and I thought, "Oh, God, if
[1:49:27] you'll just do something." And I looked
[1:49:29] back and here's a vision. And there he
[1:49:32] stood looking around in the vision. And
[1:49:34] brother,
[1:49:35] now now let something happen. AND I
[1:49:38] SAID, "I CHALLENGE EVERY MOHAMAD AND
[1:49:41] PRIEST in here, EVERY PRIEST OF BUDDHA,
[1:49:44] seek James THAT MADE FUN OF
[1:49:47] CHRISTIANITY, COME HERE AND GIVE HIM HIS
[1:49:50] SIDE."
[1:49:55] I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT REMINDS ME OF
[1:49:57] CHICAGO WHEN THEY HAD A TRAP SET FOR
[1:49:58] HIM. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? HE SAYS, "ANY ONE
[1:50:00] OF YOU PREACHERS THAT WANT TO WANT TO
[1:50:03] CHALLENGE ME ON THE WATER BAPTISM AND
[1:50:05] THE GODHEAD, COME UP HERE AND STAND BY
[1:50:07] MY SIDE." CUZ THE angel had told him,
[1:50:09] "I'll be by your right side. I'll be by
[1:50:12] your side." Challenged them. And what
[1:50:15] did they do? They were smarter than he
[1:50:17] thought. They kept their mouth closed
[1:50:18] and didn't come. Amen. But here he is.
[1:50:22] Here he is challenging them. That's
[1:50:25] another video I want to see when they
[1:50:26] get over there. Don't you? Amen.
[1:50:31] I want to do some scrolling when I go
[1:50:33] over there.
[1:50:35] David, David and Goliath, SAMSON, SAM. I
[1:50:39] WANT TO SEE THAT.
[1:50:41] [screaming]
[1:50:43] Just think ABOUT HOW MANY KNOWS FAITH
[1:50:44] COMES BY HEARING. HEARING WHAT? HEARING
[1:50:47] THOSE MAKES YOU BELIEVE GOD IS HERE. HOW
[1:50:50] MANY BELIEVE GOD IS HERE TONIGHT?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; HIS PRESENCE IS HERE. [applause]
[1:50:56] Thank you, Jesus. Anything's possible.
[1:51:02] Oh yeah.
[1:51:05] I'm going to have the time of my life.
[1:51:06] When the time of my life is over, we're
[1:51:09] going to get carried away. After we get
[1:51:12] carried away,
[1:51:14] well, we don't know why. We become a
[1:51:17] little shy. When we get around, a whole
[1:51:19] lot of people are up in the pulpit.
[1:51:21] Amen.
[1:51:23] Okay.
[1:51:25] I challenge every Muhammad or priest.
[1:51:28] See, James, you made fun of
[1:51:30] Christianity. Come here and give him a
[1:51:32] sight. Surely the God that created him.
[1:51:35] If you And he said, I'll serve the God
[1:51:37] that gives me my sight. [laughter]
[1:51:42] I'll serve the God that gives me my
[1:51:44] sight. I said, oh, of course you say
[1:51:46] he's wrong. He's a not sun worship.
[1:51:48] Sure. He's worshiping the creator
[1:51:50] instead of the create creation instead
[1:51:52] of creator. And I said, "What would your
[1:51:56] James do? You just proc the light and
[1:51:58] make him a Jane. What would you
[1:52:00] Muhammadas do?" The same thing. What
[1:52:02] would you Buy?
[1:52:06] We got the same thing in America.
[1:52:09] Amen.
[1:52:10] Oh, let me just say what comes to mind.
[1:52:12] How many knows the gospel don't come in
[1:52:13] word only but in power and demonstration
[1:52:15] of the Holy Spirit. That is the true
[1:52:18] light. The power and the demonstration
[1:52:20] of it. I said all the Methodists that
[1:52:22] like in America he wants to make
[1:52:24] everybody Baptist and Pentecostals and
[1:52:26] everybody else. But I said surely the
[1:52:29] God that made him hallelujah. The God
[1:52:31] that made him ought to do something
[1:52:33] about it. Well, you think I would have
[1:52:35] said that by by no means would I have
[1:52:38] said that if I hadn't seen that vision.
[1:52:41] Amen. I knowed where what was going to
[1:52:45] happen then and the devil couldn't do
[1:52:47] nothing about it then.
[1:52:50] [laughter]
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many glad that the message that
[1:52:53] we follow, it's the evening time light
[1:52:55] when he was in Germany and other places.
[1:52:56] Amen. And he was having a tent and THE
[1:52:58] WITCH DOCTORS ACTUALLY CALLED UP A
[1:53:00] STORM. AMEN. AND IT WAS ABOUT TO rip the
[1:53:02] tent away. But he spoke in the name OF
[1:53:05] THE LORD. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? AND GOD
[1:53:07] BROUGHT IT BACK. THERE WASN'T ENOUGH
[1:53:08] DEVILS IN HELL TO STOP THIS LIGHT FROM
[1:53:10] SHINING.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:16] OKAY. Devil couldn't do nothing then. If
[1:53:19] he'd showed a vision that if he would if
[1:53:21] he would show a vision that George
[1:53:23] Washington was going to rise from the
[1:53:24] dead in the morning, I'd invite the
[1:53:26] whole world and stand and watch it done.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What you would have done with God
[1:53:34] yesterday, you would have done it today.
[1:53:35] I believe every one of us would stand by
[1:53:37] the side of the grave and we'd be
[1:53:38] saying, "Yeah, we it's going to happen.
[1:53:40] We believe it. I believe it. It's going
[1:53:42] to happen." We wouldn't doubt, would we?
[1:53:45] No, sir. We wouldn't be called mental
[1:53:48] telepathy. And I said, "Now,
[1:53:51] you Muhammadans that say you're the
[1:53:54] predominant religion, come give him his
[1:53:56] sight and I'll be your disciple." Wow.
[1:54:01] IMAGINE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYING he's
[1:54:03] going to put Christianity down. Put
[1:54:06] everything down. That's what he said.
[1:54:09] And I'll come follow your religion.
[1:54:14] It's a very, very good challenge.
[1:54:17] Because on the flip side,
[1:54:19] ain't that right? There's a flip side to
[1:54:22] it.
[1:54:24] I'll be your disciple. You holy man.
[1:54:26] Come give him his sight. tens time tens
[1:54:30] of thousands times thousands laying in
[1:54:32] them big fields there. There set the
[1:54:35] mayor of the city. Got his name and
[1:54:37] address if you want to write him and ask
[1:54:38] him. And they said, "Why?" I I said,
[1:54:41] "You're awful still crowd."
[1:54:45] [laughter]
[1:54:46] He was nice. He was nice. Elijah in the
[1:54:50] Old Testament wasn't so nice. HE SAID,
[1:54:52] "WHERE'S YOUR GOD AT? Maybe he's on a
[1:54:54] vacation.
[1:54:55] Maybe he's asleep and you need to wake
[1:54:57] him up.
[1:55:00] But Brandon, all he says, he says,
[1:55:02] "You're quiet."
[1:55:04] He was nice on him. What's the matter
[1:55:06] with you? You were telling me today how
[1:55:09] little creity was and how great your
[1:55:11] religion WAS. I SAYS, "LOOK AT YOU
[1:55:13] PEOPLE OUT THERE. LOOK AT YOUR PRIEST.
[1:55:15] WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THEM? THEY CALLED
[1:55:17] ME A FANATIC."
[1:55:20] Telling the crowd that their priests and
[1:55:22] their pastors called him a fanatic.
[1:55:27] a American soapbox salesman selling
[1:55:30] religion like it was on a soap box
[1:55:32] because I shook my arms when the Holy
[1:55:34] Ghost was on me. I don't know, maybe it
[1:55:37] was that way. That's the way I shake my
[1:55:38] arms. I don't know how Brother Ram shook
[1:55:40] his, but sometimes the Holy Ghost just
[1:55:42] make you shake your arms, kick your
[1:55:43] feet,
[1:55:46] stomp the Holy Ghost stomp.
[1:55:53] I hope everybody with that.
[1:55:56] Brother Aram shaking his hand just
[1:55:58] because he shook his hands.
[1:56:00] Amen. They had a problem. Now notice, so
[1:56:04] he says, "SO BOX SALESMAN, LET THEM
[1:56:06] COME." Now notice, and I said, "LET THEM
[1:56:08] COME FORTH then and give this man his
[1:56:09] sight." Hallelujah. Watching that
[1:56:12] vision, I says, "Why don't you come?"
[1:56:14] "It's because you can't.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; It's because you can't." And he said,
[1:56:19] "Neither can I.
[1:56:22] But the God of heaven,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; I like the way he addresses that. But
[1:56:27] the God of heaven, the one that made the
[1:56:30] moon, the stars, the earth, and
[1:56:31] everything else in it, he says, "Who
[1:56:35] raised up his son, Christ Jesus, that
[1:56:38] gave me the vision just now that I saw
[1:56:42] that man standing there with his sight.
[1:56:44] I saw him in a vision. If he doesn't
[1:56:46] give him his sight, then I'm a false
[1:56:48] prophet. you run me out of India. If he
[1:56:52] does give him his sight, HOW MANY OF YOU
[1:56:54] Muhamadans and Buddhists and all of YOU
[1:56:57] WILL RECEIVE CHRIST as your savior?
[1:57:02] Let me tell you something people
[1:57:04] listening tonight. If you really believe
[1:57:07] this story that God did this, vindicated
[1:57:09] this prophet, how many believe you
[1:57:11] should believe? You should believe.
[1:57:14] Amen.
[1:57:17] And you should give your heart to the
[1:57:18] Lord Jesus Christ. If he does give him
[1:57:21] his heart, how many will you receive
[1:57:23] Christ? Just black hands as far as you
[1:57:26] could see. Said, "Bring him here." I put
[1:57:29] my arms around him. I said, "Lord Jesus,
[1:57:32] no more than that." Wow. Lord Jesus, no
[1:57:35] more than that. And I said, he began
[1:57:38] hollering something and hollering like
[1:57:40] that. He could see as good as I could
[1:57:44] run and grab the mayor of the city
[1:57:46] running up AND DOWN LIKE THAT. WHAT WAS
[1:57:48] IT? IT'S THE SAME GOD. GOD'S WORD IS
[1:57:51] JUST AS real tonight as he ever was.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God is just the same
[1:57:58] as he ever was.
[1:58:02] JESUS, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.
[1:58:06] That was just one of so many thousands.
[1:58:08] But that was one of the greater events
[1:58:10] where God Almighty challenged the
[1:58:13] Buddha. Jesus Christ challenged him
[1:58:15] through his prophet used him to bring
[1:58:19] light to them.
[1:58:23] 30,000
[1:58:25] raw heathens in Africa. I don't know how
[1:58:28] many in India that gave their lives to
[1:58:30] the Lord at one time.
[1:58:35] I don't know about you, but when I heard
[1:58:36] the message, something clicked.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Something clicked. If you're an eagle
[1:58:42] and you hear that eagle cry, you hear
[1:58:44] that truth, there's something that
[1:58:46] clicks. Anybody listens, I ask, does
[1:58:49] something click? Is there something in
[1:58:52] your heart that says, "I believe that's
[1:58:54] the truth. Did God really do something?"
[1:58:56] You pursue that. You follow that with
[1:58:58] all of your heart. God bless you. Stand
[1:59:00] tonight.
[1:59:04] Amen.
[1:59:08] Let's bow our heads and pray. Lord
[1:59:09] Jesus, we come before you tonight
[1:59:12] trusting Lord Jesus that Father that you
[1:59:15] will have spoken to one of your
[1:59:17] children's hearts. Lord, maybe many. But
[1:59:20] Father, I pray God that as we walk in
[1:59:22] this beautiful light, it's a wonderful
[1:59:24] light, Lord. It's not dismal anymore.
[1:59:27] It's not cloudy. It's not fl foggy
[1:59:29] anymore. It's clear. We don't have to
[1:59:33] guess at it anymore. We don't have to
[1:59:35] wonder about it anymore. It's according
[1:59:37] to what Paul preached. And it's
[1:59:39] vindicated BY YOU YOURSELF COMING down
[1:59:42] and proving it's true by many signs and
[1:59:45] wonders that followed. And Lord, we ask
[1:59:47] God that you would take everybody both
[1:59:49] in here in this congregation right now,
[1:59:52] anybody listening, and help us, God, as
[1:59:54] we raise our hands, say, "Lord, I want a
[1:59:56] closer walk with you. Lord, help me to
[1:59:59] be a greater light in my community, in
[2:00:02] my neighborhood, to my wife, to my
[2:00:03] husband, to my children, to my
[2:00:05] grandchildren, to those that I work
[2:00:07] with. Lord, help us to be a greater
[2:00:09] light. Bless every heart, every hand
[2:00:11] tonight, Lord. Make us more like you.
[2:00:13] Draw us closer to you, Lord. [snorts]
[2:00:16] And we'll give you all the glory, the
[2:00:19] honor, and the praise in Jesus Christ's
[2:00:22] name. Oh, we'll walk in the light.
[2:00:28] Such a [singing] beautiful
[2:00:31] light.
[2:00:34] And walk [singing] where the do drops of
[2:00:38] mercy
[2:00:40] are bright
[2:00:43] and all around [singing]
[2:00:46] us. God bless you, brother Ben. [music]
[2:00:49] And by night,
[2:00:52] Jesus, [singing]
[2:00:54] the light of the world. We'll walk in
[2:00:58] the light. Oh, we'll walk in
[2:01:03] the light. [singing] Such [music] a
[2:01:06] beautiful
[2:01:08] light.
[2:01:11] Come where the [singing] dew drops of
[2:01:15] mercy
[2:01:17] are bright.
[2:01:20] Shine all around us by day and by
[2:01:26] [singing] night.
[2:01:29] Jesus
[2:01:31] the light of the world.
[2:01:37] Amen. How many enjoyed the message
[2:01:38] tonight? Let's just give the Lord a hand
[2:01:40] clap of praise. [applause and music]
[2:01:43] It ought to do something for us when we
[2:01:45] hear about the goodness of God and all
[2:01:47] that he does for us and raising the dead
[2:01:49] and healing the sick and creating. You
[2:01:52] know, you you hear that story, Brother
[2:01:54] Brandham. Uh well, they it's been told
[2:01:56] about brother Brandham. He said he
[2:01:58] created the eyeballs of that little
[2:02:00] girl. He not only created those
[2:02:02] eyeballs, but he looked down, the story
[2:02:03] goes, and he says, "Sweetheart, what
[2:02:05] color eyes would you like?" And she
[2:02:08] said, 'I heard blue is pretty.
[2:02:10] Hallelujah.
[2:02:12] That's the kind of God we serve. [music]
[2:02:14] Let's say before we go, let's sing Oh, I
[2:02:16] want to see him
[2:02:18] as I journey through the land, singing
[2:02:23] as [singing] I go,
[2:02:25] pointing souls to [music]
[2:02:27] Calvary,
[2:02:29] to the [singing] crimson flow.
[2:02:33] Many arrows pierce [music and singing]
[2:02:35] my soul from withoutin.
[2:02:40] But [music] my Lord [singing]
[2:02:41] leads me on and through him I must
[2:02:44] [music] win.
[2:02:46] Oh I want to see [singing]
[2:02:49] him. Look upon his face
[2:02:53] there to sing [singing and music]
[2:02:55] forever
[2:02:57] of his saving grace.
[2:03:00] And on the streets of gloryy,
[2:03:04] let me lift my voice. [singing]
[2:03:07] [music] Cares all past home at last.
[2:03:11] Ever to rejoice [singing]
[2:03:13] [music]
[2:03:14] when before me billows rise from the
[2:03:19] mighty [singing and music] deep.
[2:03:21] Then my Lord directs my bark. He does
[2:03:26] safely [singing and music] keep
[2:03:28] and he leads me gently on through
[2:03:32] [music] this world below.
[2:03:35] And he's a real friend to me. And oh, I
[2:03:40] love him [singing] so. And oh, I want to
[2:03:44] see him. [singing and music] Look upon
[2:03:47] his face.
[2:03:49] Dare to sing [singing] forever
[2:03:53] of his saving grace.
[2:03:56] On the streets of gloryy.
[2:03:59] [singing and music]
[2:04:00] Let me lift my voice.
[2:04:03] Cares all past. [music]
[2:04:05] Home at last. [singing] Ever to rejoice.
[2:04:10] Hallelujah. I tell you, we're going to
[2:04:13] go ahead and dismiss. It's getting late
[2:04:15] tonight, but [music] the preaching of
[2:04:16] the word is worth the time spent.
[2:04:20] a lot of other places we could spend
[2:04:21] time, but no better time than right
[2:04:23] here. So, if I just want to say if
[2:04:25] anybody has a need knowing the storm's
[2:04:27] coming in, if you know anybody in need,
[2:04:30] maybe they need groceries or or
[2:04:32] preparing for maybe they need gas, they
[2:04:34] you're not going to be able to probably
[2:04:35] get out if we get what they say, please
[2:04:38] let Brother Steve and Brother David know
[2:04:40] so that [music] they can we can enter
[2:04:42] the channels to make sure everybody's
[2:04:43] taken care of. All right, so God bless
[2:04:46] you as you dismiss. Let's sing it as we
[2:04:48] go. Oh, I want to [singing and music]
[2:04:50] see him look upon his face
[2:04:56] there to sing [music and singing]
[2:04:57] forever
[2:04:59] of his saving grace.
[2:05:03] On the [singing] streets of glory,
[2:05:05] [music]
[2:05:06] your
