[34:15] amen ephesians 2
[34:18] and you
[34:19] hath he quickened who were dead in
[34:22] trespasses and sins
[34:24] wherein time passed you walked according
[34:27] to the course
[34:28] of this world according to the prince of
[34:30] the power
[34:31] of the air the spirit now worketh in the
[34:34] children of disobedience
[34:36] among whom also we all had our
[34:39] conversation in times past
[34:42] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[34:44] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[34:48] we're by nature the children of wrath
[34:50] even as others
[34:52] amen but god who is rich in mercy for
[34:56] his great love wherewith he loved us
[34:59] even when we were dead and sins hath
[35:01] quickened us together with christ by
[35:03] grace are you saved
[35:05] and as raises up together and made us to
[35:07] sit together in heavenly places in
[35:09] christ jesus
[35:11] that in the ages to come he might show
[35:13] the exceeding
[35:14] riches of his grace
[35:17] and his kindness towards us through
[35:19] christ jesus
[35:21] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[35:25] and that not of yourselves
[35:29] it is the gift of god amen not of works
[35:33] least any man should boast amen may god
[35:35] add his blessings to the reading of the
[35:37] word
[35:38] you can be seated
[35:48] amen so we find here in verse
[35:52] 4 it's what i really want to begin with
[35:54] he talks about
[35:55] how that god is
[35:57] rich in mercy
[35:59] amen
[36:00] rich and mercy and also talked about
[36:04] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[36:08] down in verse 7 it talks about the
[36:10] exceeding riches
[36:12] of his grace in his kindness towered us
[36:16] through christ jesus
[36:18] amen for by grace are you saved through
[36:20] faith that night of yourselves it is the
[36:22] gift of god amen
[36:24] amen now we know um and i want to just i
[36:26] don't know really how i'll line this all
[36:28] up but we'll just see how the lord will
[36:29] do but i thought about titling this the
[36:32] exceeding riches of his grace because
[36:34] how many knows that his grace is truly
[36:37] exceedingly rich amen
[36:40] and i really feel like you know a song
[36:42] that was wrote about oh love of god how
[36:44] rich and pure how measureless and strong
[36:47] it shall forever more endure the saints
[36:50] and angels song talks about if we could
[36:53] uh
[36:54] uh
[36:55] if the ocean was filled with ink and
[36:58] skies of parchment made and so forth and
[37:01] if every man on earth was ascribed by
[37:03] trade to try to love to write the love
[37:06] of god the grace of god and the mercy of
[37:08] god isn't that right
[37:10] amen it would drain the ocean dry so
[37:13] my
[37:14] you know
[37:15] attempt at talking about the grace the
[37:18] mercy and the love of god of course you
[37:20] know that's just going to be the grace
[37:21] of god to be able to speak anything that
[37:24] would be a portion of what it would be
[37:26] amen because it truly if it would drain
[37:28] the ocean dry
[37:30] we would be here for a while talking
[37:31] about it right
[37:33] but amen i got to thinking about this
[37:35] and and i've been around and seen a lot
[37:38] up and around my kin folks up north and
[37:40] so forth and and i realized one thing
[37:42] and that is and it happens to myself
[37:44] even i even see it kind of jumping on me
[37:47] and and so forth and all of us have it
[37:50] has it affects each and every one of us
[37:53] but when we talk about uh you know when
[37:55] we talk about the grace of god and and
[37:58] the works of god uh not the works of god
[38:00] but doing works and talk so forth we see
[38:03] that christians nowadays i mean there's
[38:05] a lot of christians that are working and
[38:08] doing things amen to
[38:11] make them feel like well if i do this
[38:13] you know maybe you know i'll deserve to
[38:15] go to heaven or
[38:17] you know if i don't do this and i'm
[38:18] going to be condemned and so forth amen
[38:21] and kind of relying and we can fall into
[38:23] that category because in our hearts none
[38:25] of us wants to do anything wrong right
[38:28] amen and so sometimes we think well you
[38:30] know we want to make sure that i have
[38:32] ever do everything just right you know
[38:36] you know and we do want to do that but
[38:38] your salvation isn't based upon that i
[38:40] mean knows that
[38:42] because we are not saved by works there
[38:44] there's nothing that anybody can do
[38:47] amen to gain your salvation
[38:50] amen the reason that you're afraid or
[38:52] the reason that you don't want to do
[38:54] anything wrong is because you don't want
[38:56] to plead displease the lord is that
[38:58] right but sometimes we get to thinking
[39:01] well you know
[39:02] it just kind of it's just in our nature
[39:04] to try to do this or do that to try to
[39:08] make sure that well i'd be fit for
[39:09] heaven for that but that will never make
[39:11] you fit
[39:12] how many knows that we're saved by grace
[39:15] and i'll tell you there's a lot of folks
[39:16] out there uh you know that are actually
[39:19] working and they absolutely believe that
[39:21] that works and if you do this and you do
[39:23] that you know if you do this you ain't
[39:25] going to heaven you know if you do this
[39:27] over here you're going to hell you know
[39:29] and and so forth but it's not that way
[39:31] how many knows that we are saved
[39:33] by grace
[39:36] now we know that grace comes from
[39:38] derives from love
[39:40] amen imagine that right because love is
[39:43] the most power god is love that's what
[39:45] god is the essence of love is what god
[39:47] is and from that amen like when you have
[39:50] love for somebody you have grace for
[39:52] somebody don't you
[39:55] yeah
[39:57] but if you don't have love for somebody
[39:59] you're not going to have a lot of grace
[40:01] amen you're going to condemn them for
[40:03] every little thing they do and they're
[40:04] going to you're going to pick them to
[40:05] death it's because there is no love
[40:08] there
[40:09] amen
[40:11] so we know that god is rich in mercy
[40:14] brother branham he's got such a
[40:16] revelation until he preached a message
[40:18] god rich in mercy because he realized
[40:20] every christian realizes that's one
[40:23] thing that god is really rich in
[40:27] and that's mercy
[40:30] that's love
[40:31] and that's grace
[40:33] i like that song don't you
[40:35] i saw love mercy and grace
[40:38] amen
[40:40] i saw love mercy and grace amen i
[40:43] envisioned his beauty and i looked upon
[40:46] his face and what did i see
[40:49] but love
[40:50] mercy and grace
[40:52] amen there's a whole chapter and i won't
[40:54] read it all but i want to just start a
[40:55] couple of them amen in one's psalms 136
[40:58] if you want to write it down
[41:01] the psalmist david he goes to talking of
[41:04] at least i don't know how many verses it
[41:06] is 26 verses that each one of those
[41:08] verses had about the mercy of the lord
[41:12] oh give thanks unto the lord for he is
[41:14] good i mean god is truly good
[41:18] for his mercy endureth forever amen he
[41:21] goes on oh give thanks unto god of god's
[41:24] for his mercy endureth forever
[41:27] amen we want to talk about you know
[41:29] about the ones that god has mercy on and
[41:32] and some people that god doesn't have
[41:34] mercy on amen and mostly i want to say
[41:37] this that even the ones that he ends up
[41:38] not having mercy on is people that he
[41:41] showed a lot of mercy to already
[41:45] amen
[41:46] so now look we'll just go down through
[41:48] here think about it here god rich in
[41:50] mercy one of the first places that we
[41:53] find that god was rich in mercy was of
[41:55] course in the garden of eden after adam
[41:58] and eve fell
[42:00] amen and how many knows that mercy
[42:02] always love and mercy always provides a
[42:05] way makes the way out of the situation
[42:08] that you're in
[42:10] that's why i love that song it was grace
[42:12] that brought us safe thus far it was
[42:14] it'll be grace that leads us safely home
[42:18] amen praise the lord how many lives by
[42:20] grace every day
[42:21] every day there's grace in your life
[42:24] there's mercy in your life because of
[42:27] the love of god now how many knows truly
[42:29] what the love of god is
[42:32] it's truly love of god the prophet of
[42:34] god taught us that god is love is
[42:36] elective love
[42:38] amen
[42:39] the fact that god elected you shows that
[42:42] he loves you amen it's elective love
[42:46] that's what god's love is
[42:47] amen
[42:48] we find that cain not king and abel but
[42:51] uh with adam and eve he provided them a
[42:54] lamb skin isn't that right he killed the
[42:56] lamb and made a substitute that was
[42:58] going to be their covering that covers
[43:00] them temporarily
[43:02] right
[43:03] and they ended up going having to be
[43:04] driven from the garden covered in lamb
[43:06] skin
[43:08] praise be the god now he knows that
[43:10] we're still covered by lambskin the lamb
[43:13] of god amen we're covered by the lamb of
[43:15] god tonight
[43:16] even god made that he provided for him
[43:18] and then amen after after all of that we
[43:22] know that adam and eve had a couple of
[43:24] children and amen and so forth and and
[43:26] with cain and abel
[43:28] and cain drove cars rose up
[43:32] and bashed abel's head in
[43:34] out in the field
[43:36] killed him
[43:38] murdered him
[43:40] and god can you imagine what his
[43:43] sentence should have been
[43:44] automatic death but god didn't kill him
[43:46] did he
[43:48] god didn't kill him and not only that
[43:49] but he came and god came to him said
[43:51] where's your brother and so forth how
[43:52] are you brother and then god had mercy
[43:54] on even cain and said look if you'll do
[43:57] like abel did
[43:58] you'll be accepted god was going to
[44:00] accept him after he done all that
[44:03] if he'll just repent i'll accept him
[44:07] that's truly mercy
[44:09] i mean believe that you know
[44:11] there's nobody let me say this
[44:13] there is absolutely nobody that hasn't
[44:16] been shown mercy by god
[44:21] whosoever believeth him and should not
[44:24] perish but have everlasting life john 3
[44:26] 16 that's mercy to the whole world his
[44:29] mercy is so great that he wants to
[44:31] pardon the sins of anybody everywhere
[44:37] wow
[44:38] that's a pretty gracious god
[44:40] wouldn't you say that's pretty
[44:42] rich in mercy
[44:45] thank god for his rich mercy
[44:48] praise be to the lord
[44:51] i'll tell you this i believe god is much
[44:53] more richer in mercy than you and i are
[44:56] we are not near as patient as pe with
[44:58] people as what god is
[45:00] our patience just doesn't go that far
[45:04] you let somebody do you wrong a hundred
[45:06] times
[45:08] no you won't even let him do that much
[45:10] will you
[45:11] huh about 15 20 depends on who it is
[45:15] huh
[45:16] that's right depends on who it is
[45:19] and everything else
[45:20] remember peter said to jesus one time he
[45:22] says how many times i might forgive my
[45:24] brother seven times in a day that was a
[45:27] pretty big number probably for peter
[45:28] hot-headed guy
[45:30] don't be messing up again
[45:32] right you done did it three times
[45:35] seven times in a day and jesus says i
[45:38] say unto you not seven times but seven
[45:41] times seventy times in a day seven times
[45:43] seven times in a day 490 right
[45:46] 490 times a day that's pretty rich in
[45:49] mercy
[45:49] [Music]
[45:54] and think
[45:55] god is that rich in mercy for you and i
[45:58] because i'm here to tell you how many
[46:00] knows if
[46:01] it isn't the grace the mercy of god none
[46:03] of us make it in the first place if
[46:04] you're relying on your words
[46:06] first time a wrong thought goes
[46:09] through there hello
[46:10] you know not even the d just a thought
[46:13] because as a man thinking it's in his
[46:15] heart so is he you know
[46:17] amen
[46:18] so god thank god for mercy folks thank
[46:21] god for grace
[46:22] amen
[46:24] we look on down we see how
[46:26] that amen he has doesn't save us by
[46:29] works we're not saved by works but we're
[46:31] saved by grace
[46:33] through faith and that not of ourselves
[46:35] it is
[46:36] the gift of god
[46:38] now we know that abraham god
[46:41] god chose abraham let's talk about real
[46:43] mercy
[46:44] before we get into that that's my let me
[46:46] go back a little bit further can we go
[46:47] back let's go back to the days of noah
[46:49] look at the mercy they had
[46:51] now how many knows that
[46:58] let me come down here
[47:00] get personal here with y'alls wake you
[47:02] up on the wednesday night i know it's
[47:03] been a hard day
[47:05] all right
[47:06] with brad and all of y'all it's right
[47:08] here
[47:08] right this is four
[47:11] five six seven i need one more
[47:13] one more
[47:14] we'll include brother brian
[47:16] all right brother brian
[47:18] i gotta do my math right here right here
[47:21] see this group right here
[47:25] in the andaluvian destruction this is
[47:27] all that was saved this is it
[47:31] is that a big crowd
[47:33] it's not even all of y'all
[47:36] can you imagine eight people
[47:40] eight people
[47:43] all the rest of them drowned it
[47:46] isn't that right
[47:48] where do you find mercy and brother
[47:50] father that's not a whole lot of mercy
[47:52] the whole world was annihilated killed
[47:55] all except hey
[47:59] yeah
[48:00] that's exactly right but the mercy part
[48:02] of it was in what can somebody tell me
[48:04] that where was the mercy at
[48:10] that's right
[48:11] 120 years of mercy
[48:18] you know i would say a lifetime but back
[48:21] then they lived about 800 years so i
[48:23] can't do that
[48:25] before the flood they lived a long time
[48:26] isn't that right
[48:28] but it's still 120 years of crying out
[48:31] to them and begging him and giving him
[48:33] mercy and and reaching out his hand he
[48:36] had a lot of mercy
[48:38] i want you to know that god gives mercy
[48:41] to the unbelievers but if they continue
[48:43] to disbelieve
[48:45] that mercy runs
[48:46] out and they have to be judged for their
[48:50] unbelief
[48:53] mercy never runs out for a believer it
[48:56] only runs out for the unbeliever
[48:59] that mercy finally come to an end
[49:02] and when it was over with
[49:04] it was over with
[49:07] and he
[49:08] drowned them all because they wouldn't
[49:10] accept his mercy
[49:11] now what the prophet teaches he says he
[49:13] says if you do not accept god's mercy
[49:16] amen you have to accept and stand
[49:20] his punishment
[49:22] only two opposition only two ways to go
[49:24] either take god's punishment
[49:26] or accept his mercy
[49:29] amen
[49:31] i've said it before can i say it again
[49:34] god knew that we needed a lot of mercy
[49:37] he knew how fallible
[49:39] we are
[49:41] and that's why he didn't say peter yeah
[49:44] you're right that's going to be our
[49:45] keynote but you tie on or bind on earth
[49:47] will be bound in heaven we'll give
[49:49] everybody seven chances in a day and
[49:51] then that'll be it no
[49:53] he wasn't that short on mercy
[49:56] he went to 490 times
[49:59] folks i don't know about you but
[50:00] somebody would be doing you right wrong
[50:02] on a constant constant
[50:07] i don't know how many seconds every few
[50:08] seconds every few minutes
[50:10] you know to get 490 times in
[50:15] praise the lord
[50:17] so we look at this and we see that they
[50:19] were given lots of mercy they were given
[50:22] lots of grace
[50:24] they should god showed him a lot of love
[50:27] but then when they would not hear
[50:30] god destroyed him
[50:31] because they wouldn't listen they
[50:32] wouldn't accept mercy except eight
[50:35] people
[50:36] amen
[50:38] i wonder how many will be going in the
[50:40] rapture just a handful perhaps
[50:42] amen
[50:44] then we go on down take a little further
[50:46] journey down to abraham
[50:48] how many knows that god
[50:51] came and called
[50:53] abraham
[50:54] and that calling is the same kind of
[50:56] calling that god calls you with
[50:59] i mean he knows what that is
[51:01] that is god calling and god electing
[51:05] abraham
[51:06] now when he put adam on a basis he put
[51:10] him on a basis that if you don't need to
[51:11] do tree
[51:13] if you don't do this out of the other
[51:15] you'll live and everything will be fine
[51:17] but he couldn't keep it could he
[51:19] and he but god says look i have blessed
[51:21] thee and i will multiply thee he never
[51:24] he gave him an unconditional covenant
[51:27] not if you do this and i did i have
[51:29] already done it i'm going to see to it
[51:31] that it's going to happen
[51:33] now you talk about grace because true
[51:36] mercy true grace is what god had for you
[51:41] before the foundation of the world
[51:46] real mercy is for god to choose you
[51:52] amen
[51:54] for god to choose you
[51:56] and when does he do that
[51:58] he did that before the foundation of the
[52:00] world that's true mercy
[52:02] revelation 13 and 8 says and all that
[52:05] dwell upon the earth shall worship him
[52:07] whose names are not written are not
[52:10] written in the book of life of the lamb
[52:12] slain from the foundation of the world
[52:16] hallelujah
[52:19] now that's real
[52:20] mercy
[52:22] the thing that he knew abraham he called
[52:24] abraham said abraham i'm calling you i'm
[52:27] blessing you
[52:31] this is a unconditional saving
[52:34] and abraham believed him abraham
[52:36] believed god and god imputed that faith
[52:39] that belief
[52:41] upon abraham as righteousness
[52:44] now how many knows that goes for every
[52:46] child of abraham every son and abraham
[52:49] dollar abraham comes to god amen that's
[52:51] what it's based upon when god accepts
[52:54] your faith
[52:56] it is upon imputed unto you for
[52:59] righteousness
[53:01] amen
[53:03] god picks
[53:06] who he wants to have mercy on
[53:12] isn't that kind of strong
[53:14] brother butler you really need some
[53:16] scriptures for that
[53:18] okay run with me romans 9.
[53:21] romans 9
[53:22] and verse 11 says for the children but
[53:25] let's go back one so we know what we're
[53:26] talking about and not only this but when
[53:28] rebecca also had conceived by one even
[53:31] by our father isaac
[53:33] for the children being not yet born
[53:35] neither having done any good or evil
[53:38] verse 11 that the purpose of god
[53:40] according to election might stand
[53:42] not of works but of him that calleth
[53:48] oh my when i get to thinking about the
[53:50] mercy and the grace of god i get to
[53:52] thinking about how that paul said he
[53:54] didn't have begun to work and you is
[53:57] able to perform it
[53:59] how many relies on how many believes
[54:02] that with all your heart that god has
[54:03] started working you and he'll finish it
[54:08] amen
[54:09] it was said unto her the elder shall
[54:12] serve the younger and as it is written
[54:14] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
[54:20] my
[54:22] what shall we say then is there
[54:24] unrighteousness with god god forbid
[54:27] amen
[54:28] for he saith to moses
[54:31] i will have mercy on whom i will have
[54:35] mercy
[54:38] say stay seated now don't get too happy
[54:40] about this
[54:42] if god
[54:44] showed you mercy
[54:46] aren't you blessed
[54:48] aren't you a privileged person tonight
[54:51] and god has shown his mercy on you
[54:56] if god has called you if god has
[54:59] accepted your sacrifice of repentance if
[55:02] he has filled you with the holy ghost
[55:05] you can't shouldn't hardly be able to
[55:07] stand yourself
[55:12] to think
[55:13] it wasn't you
[55:17] you thought it was you but it was him
[55:18] long before you ever come in the picture
[55:21] he chose you before the foundation of
[55:23] the world if he's chosen you at all
[55:26] amen you were saved before the
[55:28] foundation of the world if you're ever
[55:29] going to be saved you save there you
[55:32] ain't got to have no fear of being lost
[55:35] no sir
[55:37] oh my he says i'll have mercy on who i
[55:40] want to have mercy and i will have
[55:41] compassion on whom i will have
[55:43] compassion
[55:45] oh i tell you what i just don't know the
[55:48] words to say to people that want to try
[55:50] to tell god how to run his business
[55:53] they want to try to tell her what god is
[55:55] just what's not just and all of that
[55:57] he's god he can do what he wants and i
[56:00] guarantee you this
[56:02] whatever he does is just
[56:09] let me just say this to somebody that
[56:11] would be a critic of god and the way
[56:13] that he chooses and so the way that he
[56:15] willeth
[56:16] you just have a scribbled up mind yet
[56:19] because god's mind's not scribbled up
[56:22] he doesn't do it wrong
[56:24] not one bit he's way too perfect to do
[56:27] anything wrong
[56:30] it's not god that hasn't got it right
[56:32] it's people that don't have it right
[56:37] we come god's way or we don't come
[56:41] you don't have to accept the mercy of
[56:43] god no
[56:44] you can curse him use his name in vain
[56:47] defy him and everything else that you
[56:49] want you can do that
[56:51] but one thing you won't do
[56:53] is escape his judgment
[56:56] you won't escape the punishment for that
[56:58] that you won't do no matter how much you
[57:00] think you will
[57:05] that's exactly right
[57:07] if you do
[57:08] if you do escape it he'll have to raise
[57:10] sodom and gomorrah and apologize
[57:13] if homosexual
[57:15] if homosexuality and lesbianism is okay
[57:18] you'll have to raise up sodom and
[57:20] gomorrah and apologize
[57:23] all right but if it's wrong you're going
[57:25] to burn just like they burn
[57:28] you're going to perish just like they
[57:29] perished
[57:31] you don't you don't mark god
[57:35] what a man shows he will surely reap
[57:41] that wasn't in the script but in god's
[57:43] script is that all right
[57:46] now
[57:48] you can accept
[57:49] and accept his mercy and believe god
[57:53] know that that that verse i've preached
[57:56] on it before
[57:58] and i really really liked the last time
[58:00] i preached it
[58:02] but it just came in my mind again the
[58:04] other day
[58:07] revelations one and seven says behold he
[58:09] cometh with clouds and every eye
[58:12] shall see him and they also which
[58:15] pierced him and all kindreds of the
[58:17] earth shall wail because of him even so
[58:21] amen
[58:22] what does he say every i
[58:25] shall see him
[58:26] [Applause]
[58:27] all these naysayers and jesus ain't
[58:30] right christianity right all of them are
[58:32] hypocrites all of everything you can be
[58:35] as negative you want to
[58:37] he didn't really die but when you look
[58:39] upon him
[58:41] huh
[58:42] when you look at it and you know that is
[58:45] christ and that he died for your sin
[58:47] huh
[58:48] when they look at him they're gonna fail
[58:50] because they know they rejected the
[58:53] truth when they heard it
[58:55] and they're gonna start weeping and
[58:57] wailing
[58:59] just seeing him will do it
[59:02] there's your evidence
[59:05] all of your unbelief is gone now cause
[59:07] right there it is
[59:09] here he is
[59:12] that's how it's gonna be folks you can
[59:14] deny him all you want to know but you're
[59:16] gonna look at him one day even then it
[59:18] pierced on him pierced his side and
[59:20] everything else if god be the son of god
[59:22] come off the cross they all had to doubt
[59:24] but when they see him again
[59:26] there's not going to be any doubt
[59:27] anymore
[59:28] [Music]
[59:29] and they'll know they're condemned
[59:32] they'll know they're going to be damned
[59:34] because of not receiving him
[59:37] and not believing
[59:39] that the mercy that he had on calvary
[59:41] they turned down
[59:44] whosoever will let him come that's the
[59:46] message
[59:47] and they chose not to come
[59:50] amen
[59:53] amen
[59:55] and they do it
[59:58] who is kind of strong the gospel is
[1:00:00] because they're not of god
[1:00:02] they're of the devil
[1:00:04] that's why they don't do it it's because
[1:00:06] they're not of god
[1:00:07] they're not children of god
[1:00:10] oh they get so mad at you
[1:00:13] oh they could kill you for that
[1:00:15] didn't the pharisees do does this that
[1:00:17] to jesus whenever he says my words have
[1:00:19] no place with him abraham is not your
[1:00:22] daddy the devil is your daddy

[1:06:25] you love him
[1:06:29] oh my let's go them a little further
[1:06:32] let's just talk about a couple shall we
[1:06:35] people who really
[1:06:38] appreciated the grace of almighty god
[1:06:42] and his mercy
[1:06:43] how many knows god was merciful with
[1:06:45] israel
[1:06:47] wasn't he very merciful
[1:06:49] his mercy just endured endured endured
[1:06:53] when dayth and korra did what they did
[1:06:54] and so forth
[1:06:56] god said moses
[1:06:58] separate yourself
[1:07:01] they that went off in the idle worship
[1:07:02] and everything else and just separate
[1:07:04] yourself from the whole bunch
[1:07:07] and i believe if i'm not wrong if i
[1:07:09] remember right god said something about
[1:07:11] and i'll consume them
[1:07:13] in a moment
[1:07:18] how many knows god would just have to
[1:07:19] wave his hand a little bit everybody
[1:07:20] just
[1:07:22] they'd be dead instantly
[1:07:26] how many knows if god's hanging on you
[1:07:28] every day you could just drop over and
[1:07:30] be gone
[1:07:31] every day that you live is grace every
[1:07:34] breath that you draw is grace every bit
[1:07:37] of strength that you have
[1:07:38] is grace
[1:07:40] it's the mercy of almighty god
[1:07:43] because when he draws your heart folks
[1:07:45] one way or they'll be one amen but he
[1:07:48] could have just done that to the whole
[1:07:49] crowd
[1:07:50] for their unbelief for their hardness of
[1:07:53] heart stubborn people
[1:07:56] how many knows that
[1:07:58] whenever
[1:07:59] the pharisees talked about the
[1:08:01] israelites and so forth and how they ate
[1:08:03] manna in the wilderness jesus says dear
[1:08:05] everyone
[1:08:06] dead
[1:08:08] when he says that about lazarus he says
[1:08:10] he sleepeth
[1:08:11] there's a big difference between
[1:08:13] sleeping and being dead dead is total
[1:08:15] separation from god
[1:08:17] all those adult people that of israel
[1:08:21] is all wasting their time god was
[1:08:22] wasting not wasting his time but moses
[1:08:25] fell into breach didn't he said god
[1:08:27] don't destroy and the enemies will say
[1:08:29] that god took him out there and couldn't
[1:08:31] take him on in and
[1:08:32] moses is the grace and the love of god
[1:08:34] in moses heart fell in the breach for
[1:08:36] those people and gave them another
[1:08:38] chance
[1:08:40] which we know that katie's barnea be a
[1:08:41] complaint for the last time when the
[1:08:43] spies came back
[1:08:44] and brought an evil report and a good
[1:08:46] report and they believed their uneven
[1:08:48] report and they went back out in the
[1:08:49] wilderness for 40 years and everyone
[1:08:51] perished their children went in
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:55] so they ended up perishing
[1:08:57] after all
[1:09:00] for not what
[1:09:02] believing
[1:09:05] amen
[1:09:07] i will say there is one thing that you
[1:09:10] must do
[1:09:11] to be saved
[1:09:13] one thing you must do
[1:09:16] to be saved
[1:09:18] somebody tell me what it is
[1:09:23] believe
[1:09:24] the word is
[1:09:26] belief he that believeth
[1:09:28] and is baptized shall be saved he that
[1:09:31] believeth not
[1:09:33] shall be damn
[1:09:35] you
[1:09:36] have to
[1:09:37] believe
[1:09:38] when those people look upon him they
[1:09:40] didn't believe before they believe now
[1:09:42] but it's too late right
[1:09:44] to believe
[1:09:46] in that faith in that truth
[1:09:48] is giving you as a gift of god that's
[1:09:50] why we ought to be so happy if you're a
[1:09:52] christian tonight
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:56] cain was given grace given mercy shown
[1:10:00] love after killing abel
[1:10:03] david was the same also david had killed
[1:10:05] a man murdered him in that right
[1:10:09] was it
[1:10:10] samuel i believe came to david
[1:10:13] told him the story of the little
[1:10:15] lamb that a man took took his only lamb
[1:10:17] killed it and so forth
[1:10:19] and david said what should we do to that
[1:10:21] man
[1:10:23] david said
[1:10:25] samuel asked david what should we do
[1:10:27] david said that man shall surely die
[1:10:31] he shall surely die
[1:10:33] it was a different story when samuel
[1:10:34] says hey david you're the man
[1:10:38] you're the man
[1:10:41] but you shall not surely die
[1:10:43] he was shown mercy
[1:10:45] he the mercy of god
[1:10:47] how many knows so many times we
[1:10:49] don't deserve the mercy of god
[1:10:52] no we don't that's what mercy is that's
[1:10:54] what grace is
[1:10:56] unmerited favor
[1:10:58] with god greatness unmerited favor
[1:11:02] with god that's because you did
[1:11:04] something
[1:11:06] amen but it's simply the mercy and grace
[1:11:09] of almighty god
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:13] saul
[1:11:16] named paul later we know that he
[1:11:18] was also
[1:11:20] guilty of contoning and taking part in
[1:11:23] the murder of stephen in the new
[1:11:25] testament
[1:11:27] saul before he was paul i mean before he
[1:11:29] was paul saul amen he was a persecutor
[1:11:32] of the church of the living god that
[1:11:34] right
[1:11:35] persecuted her and even held the
[1:11:37] people's coats while they went and
[1:11:38] stoned stephen so he can donate to it
[1:11:40] he was part in it
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:44] in today's laws
[1:11:46] if you're driving a getaway car of
[1:11:48] somebody that gets shot you get
[1:11:50] guilty of murder too
[1:11:52] right and when he was struck down on the
[1:11:55] road to damascus he found the true grace
[1:11:58] of god
[1:11:59] he tried he found out what the mercy of
[1:12:01] god really was
[1:12:03] that he deserved to die
[1:12:06] he was guilty of that he was guilty of
[1:12:08] trying to kill the very one that he was
[1:12:12] claiming to serve
[1:12:13] why persecute us thou me jesus says
[1:12:16] and right after he was struck down by
[1:12:19] the light he realized what the grace of
[1:12:21] god was and he wrote about the grace
[1:12:23] that has been given to me
[1:12:25] in the dispensation
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:29] amen praise the lord there's that little
[1:12:31] squawk i was talking about
[1:12:34] you love the lord
[1:12:36] how many just wants to say god let me
[1:12:38] enjoy and and with your mercy so much
[1:12:41] every day i live
[1:12:43] i thank god for his mercy and for his
[1:12:45] grace
[1:12:46] and then you think i want to bring one
[1:12:47] more just one more little thought in
[1:12:49] closing the hour in which we live but
[1:12:51] the brand talked about it in the god of
[1:12:53] mercy talk about the age that we look at
[1:12:55] where we're living
[1:12:56] look at the times that we're in
[1:12:58] look at all the different religions
[1:13:02] which way is right and in the midst of
[1:13:05] all of that god comes down and proves
[1:13:08] himself alive like never before and
[1:13:10] shows us the way it says this is the way
[1:13:12] and it's right back to
[1:13:14] the word
[1:13:17] amen in all of this chaos that we're in
[1:13:21] amen
[1:13:22] seeing all the different religions
[1:13:25] i've seen a lot of amish mennonite
[1:13:29] holdermen all different kinds of amish
[1:13:32] last weekend
[1:13:34] and i said to who was it i think it was
[1:13:36] my cousin
[1:13:40] talking about
[1:13:43] each one of them actually proves
[1:13:46] that their tradition and their the way
[1:13:48] that they believe isn't isn't right
[1:13:52] because
[1:13:54] i don't think any of them would be so
[1:13:56] narrow-minded
[1:13:57] as to say look
[1:13:59] if you have a tractor with steel wheels
[1:14:01] on it you'll be able to go to heaven but
[1:14:03] if it's got rubber tires you're going to
[1:14:05] hell
[1:14:07] huh
[1:14:09] or
[1:14:10] you know just it was just so many
[1:14:13] different little things and then go on
[1:14:16] to people that even have cars i remember
[1:14:19] my unc my uncle so it said to my my
[1:14:21] first cousin david he said when he was
[1:14:22] leaving the army she's kind of leaving
[1:14:23] down me and he says just don't buy a car
[1:14:26] don't have a car
[1:14:28] and david says they were having a
[1:14:30] conversation i'd seen the conversation
[1:14:32] he was at the funeral and they were over
[1:14:34] there talking and he was trying to tell
[1:14:35] him don't get a car he says well i'll
[1:14:36] tell you what i won't
[1:14:38] if you just won't ride in once it's so
[1:14:40] wrong
[1:14:46] i said that was a good one
[1:14:49] oh it's you go to hell if you drive a
[1:14:51] car
[1:14:53] but you can ride you can hire them all
[1:14:54] day your mom's folks say buy the truck
[1:14:57] just put it in the english boy's name
[1:14:59] and have him come and haul him and a lot
[1:15:01] of his boys do that
[1:15:05] huh
[1:15:08] it amazes me that the folks can't see
[1:15:11] that it's pharisees again all over the
[1:15:13] place it's hypocrisy all over again
[1:15:16] right
[1:15:20] so i said so david so in other words
[1:15:23] when you're riding in the passenger seat
[1:15:25] you're going to heaven but change seats
[1:15:28] and you're going to hell
[1:15:33] don't make a lot of sense does it it
[1:15:35] goes to prove
[1:15:36] that it's really not anything to do with
[1:15:39] doing this little thing
[1:15:41] anything outside of the bible it's all
[1:15:43] man's tradition
[1:15:45] it's teaching for doctrine the
[1:15:47] commandments of men is all it is
[1:15:50] amen
[1:15:52] and the devil's got them so fooled that
[1:15:54] they don't even see that themselves if
[1:15:56] they would ever get to see that to
[1:15:58] realize hey you know i wouldn't want to
[1:15:59] condemn all of them folks are going to
[1:16:01] hell or those folks because they're
[1:16:03] doing the same thing i am just have
[1:16:04] their boundaries and so forth you got to
[1:16:06] realize it's get under the blood of
[1:16:07] jesus christ come to the word of god
[1:16:10] that's what this message does come out
[1:16:12] of all that come to the word of god
[1:16:15] don't let the pastor don't let nobody
[1:16:16] teach anything but what that bible says
[1:16:19] it's back to the word
[1:16:22] then we could all be brothers and
[1:16:23] sisters and everything will be fine but
[1:16:25] it's the devil that keeps all those
[1:16:26] barriers all those fences up
[1:16:28] amen god bless you let's stand musicians
[1:16:31] if you'll come
[1:16:38] aren't you glad for the mercy and the
[1:16:40] grace that god has shown you tonight
[1:16:42] the love that he had for you to show you
[1:16:45] that mercy and that grace
[1:16:47] that desire that you have for more of
[1:16:50] god it's not just their accidental
[1:16:53] that's just not a natural that is
[1:16:55] something that god has placed in your
[1:16:57] heart
[1:16:58] i want more of jesus more and more and
[1:17:01] more don't you
[1:17:02] amen
[1:17:04] let's sing that little course i will
[1:17:05] sing of the mercies of the lord
[1:17:07] forever i will sing
[1:17:10] you'll come
