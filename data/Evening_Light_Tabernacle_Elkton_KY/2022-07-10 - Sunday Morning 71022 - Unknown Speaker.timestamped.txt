[13:00] let them be confounded and consumed that

[13:50] high who has done great things o god who

[14:22] sing unto thee and my soul which thou
[14:25] has redeemed
[14:26] my tongue also shall talk of thy
[14:29] righteousness all the day long for they
[14:31] are confounded for their brought unto
[14:34] shame that seek my hurt
[14:36] god bless you may be seated for brian
[14:50] good morning brothers and sisters
[14:54] you know you go to the doctor and he
[14:55] fixes you up and a couple of days later
[14:58] you go out there and work and you tear
[15:01] it all up again so
[15:04] uh if you return with me to
[15:07] the fourth chapter of second corinthians
[15:10] before i get started you know the thing
[15:12] about that psalm from last week and this
[15:15] week
[15:17] if david is
[15:19] david isn't looking at his problems or
[15:21] his circumstances
[15:22] he's looking to the god of his savior
[15:25] and the god of heaven he's praising god
[15:28] no matter what the circumstances he was
[15:30] in wherever he was at he wasn't looking
[15:33] there but he was looking forward to the
[15:35] god and what
[15:37] how great his god was and how great his
[15:40] god the things he could do for him he
[15:42] wasn't looking at his problems and a lot
[15:44] of times
[15:45] you know your enemy that's what he wants
[15:47] you to do
[15:48] he wants you to focus on all the bad
[15:50] things going on in your life all the
[15:52] problems whether they're physical things
[15:54] financial things personal things
[15:57] his goal is to get you to focus on those
[15:59] things instead of the focus on your god
[16:01] and not jesus christ his whole goal is
[16:04] to get you
[16:05] to worry about things that you really
[16:07] can't control or have no control over
[16:10] and a lot of times you spend your whole
[16:11] life
[16:12] worrying after things that you have no
[16:14] control over and you'll find out that
[16:16] sometimes you're going to come short
[16:18] because you are worrying about the wrong
[16:20] thing
[16:21] but as i get started here brother thomas
[16:24] asked me to talk about
[16:26] where we're at as church when it comes
[16:28] to the loan payment and
[16:30] this is the this is the last one i paid
[16:33] so
[16:34] when i got
[16:35] making the principal and the interest
[16:37] payment so
[16:39] uh we started some of you
[16:41] we started at 200 000
[16:44] and uh
[16:45] what we're down to right now is 69
[16:49] 387 and 89 cents
[16:52] basically we're down to 69 and 400.
[16:56] that's what we have left on principle
[16:59] so if i confuse some of you i apologize
[17:02] so our normal interest payment
[17:05] based on that excuse me our
[17:07] our normal interest payment based on
[17:10] that principal amount is anywhere from
[17:12] 239 depending on the time of the month
[17:15] to 300
[17:16] a month but with what we have left in
[17:19] principle
[17:21] the best way i know how to explain this
[17:22] and break it down
[17:24] if i just paid the the
[17:26] monthly amount that i'm required to pay
[17:29] which is anywhere from 10 70 to 10 50
[17:34] that would leave 64 payments left on the
[17:37] church based on that principal amount
[17:40] which is five years and four months
[17:42] but i i do pay more than the normal
[17:45] amount depending on what the general
[17:47] fund is at that time
[17:49] so i've been usually been able to make
[17:51] anywhere from fifteen to sixteen hundred
[17:53] dollars a month
[17:55] in the
[17:56] at the monthly payment i make
[17:59] which would
[18:00] which would reduce the
[18:01] [Music]
[18:04] to pay off the loan right now if we just
[18:06] if i just kept doing it the way i'm
[18:08] doing it right now
[18:10] would be three years and nine months
[18:12] basically four years from now
[18:14] the the
[18:15] church loan property would be paid off
[18:17] and that's assuming that everything is
[18:19] okay
[18:21] and uh and that was based again on that
[18:24] sixty four thousand dollars but
[18:27] some of you are smart enough to know
[18:28] you're going to think well as you pay
[18:30] principal your interest at the end of
[18:32] the loan changes and that's true but i'm
[18:34] just using ballpark figures here so
[18:37] basically if we don't do anything and i
[18:40] pay the usual extra what for about four
[18:43] years left if i were just something were
[18:45] to happen i could just barely meet the
[18:47] payment
[18:48] it would be five years and four months i
[18:50] just threw some numbers out
[18:52] so let's say we um
[18:55] if i were tomorrow were to pay ten
[18:57] thousand dollars off on the principal
[18:59] amount that we have right now
[19:02] and you just have to use your little
[19:03] calculators in your mind that would
[19:05] leave 59 400 to pay
[19:08] again if i just did the minimum payment
[19:10] that would be four years and seven
[19:12] months left to pay the loan off
[19:15] and then if i pay the normal amount the
[19:17] fifteen hundred dollars a little extra i
[19:20] pay
[19:20] it would be three years and three months
[19:22] left and then i just threw another
[19:26] number out there
[19:27] if we were to pay
[19:29] tomorrow or a month from now
[19:32] 20 000 off the principal amount and
[19:34] bringing it down to
[19:36] you know uh fifty thousand dollars that
[19:39] would leave three years and nine months
[19:41] paying the normal payment
[19:44] two years and eight months if paying
[19:47] what that i did pay and of course you
[19:48] got to remember
[19:50] it's actually going to be paid off a few
[19:54] few more months even earlier than that
[19:56] because the interest that they're
[19:57] charging on that amount changes
[20:00] and uh when we first took the loan out
[20:02] it was a slight floater it right now
[20:05] we're uh we're paying four and four and
[20:07] a quarter interest right now
[20:09] uh on the loan like i said we uh the
[20:12] maturity date
[20:14] is uh august 2030 uh with like i said
[20:18] well well ahead of that time right now
[20:21] if you've got questions don't be afraid
[20:23] to ask me about this
[20:25] um and i also wrote down what we had in
[20:27] the
[20:28] on this sheet of paper here right now on
[20:30] the general front of the church right
[20:32] now we have uh
[20:34] about
[20:35] uh ten thousand and five hundred dollars
[20:38] uh there are some there is a little bit
[20:41] left over from the
[20:43] uh missionary there's probably
[20:45] about
[20:46] a thousand dollars of that
[20:48] that is missionary funds that people
[20:50] have put into the offering not dedicated
[20:52] to you crane that would come out of that
[20:54] amount
[20:55] and some other
[20:57] things that have to be done out of that
[20:59] amount but mostly that's what we have
[21:01] available and
[21:05] as a treasurer i try not to
[21:07] met i try to keep the general fund as
[21:09] close to that as i can so i and like
[21:12] i've told you before in the summer time
[21:13] i you never know what could happen you
[21:15] know things are expensive nowadays i
[21:17] know everyone says that but
[21:19] you you really whatever you do for a
[21:22] business you know that things have
[21:23] really changed in the last 18 months on
[21:25] what things cost you'd be surprised on
[21:28] if you hadn't done something in a couple
[21:30] of years and want to do it today and pay
[21:33] for it you'd be surprised at how the
[21:35] cost of things have changed in the last
[21:37] 18 months but uh like i said if you have
[21:40] any questions
[21:42] uh don't be afraid to ask me
[21:44] uh i know i say that a lot but i don't
[21:47] mean to be funny about it but just going
[21:49] back to the scripture
[21:51] not taking a lot of time i was reading
[21:54] some devotionals this morning
[21:56] uh i'm probably going to go off my point
[21:58] i was reading some things and i was
[22:00] reading what brother branham had to say
[22:01] this morning in the devotional and i was
[22:03] reading what
[22:04] other people had in their devotionals
[22:06] and they kind of tied together brother
[22:09] branham was talking about the state of
[22:11] the church or the state of the country
[22:13] in in his time frame you know the late
[22:16] 1950s or early 1960s
[22:19] you know i i wasn't that old in that
[22:22] time frame i was just a young man and i
[22:24] was thinking how he was talking about
[22:26] how the women were doing and how the
[22:28] country was doing even back then in in
[22:31] the 1960s and i was just thinking
[22:34] sometimes we take for granted what he's
[22:36] telling us he prophetically he's looking
[22:39] forward to the age that we live in right
[22:41] now and
[22:42] some of it as you get older some people
[22:44] realize you didn't think you would we'd
[22:46] be in a country that's at this state
[22:48] this morning that we're in but it should
[22:50] give you hope it should make you go
[22:52] further into christ not further away
[22:54] from christ if if you find the
[22:56] circumstances that you're seeing in the
[22:58] world today
[23:00] are
[23:00] are making your experience or
[23:02] questioning your foundation then there's
[23:04] something wrong with it to begin with
[23:06] and you need to go back to that bedrock
[23:08] itself where you started from but let me
[23:10] uh read here what it has to say in
[23:12] corinthians
[23:14] i'm not wanting to take a lot of times
[23:17] in and i was uh i'm just going to jump
[23:19] and read something else here i had it
[23:22] marked i don't know if i can find it no
[23:24] i took it out yeah i'll just read a few
[23:26] scriptures out of
[23:28] uh out of galatians you don't have to
[23:30] turn there fifth chapter
[23:33] uh it's one of the
[23:34] chapters that paul one of the epistles i
[23:37] like the most but i'll just read a few
[23:39] of these verses out of uh chapter five
[23:41] of galatians this is paul speaking here
[23:45] stanfast therefore in the liberty worth
[23:48] christ had made you free and be not
[23:50] entangled again with the yoke of bondage
[23:53] and of course we know he's going to go
[23:54] on later in this chapter and talk about
[23:56] the act of circumcision
[23:59] and paul was trying to explain to the
[24:01] jewish church that that circumcision we
[24:04] have now as christians is not in a
[24:06] physical sense but it's in the spiritual
[24:08] sense
[24:09] where you're circumcised in your heart
[24:12] to the things of god and he goes on and
[24:14] stands as therefore in the liberty
[24:16] whereas christ had made us free
[24:18] and being out of tangible again with the
[24:20] yoke of bondage paul saying to you that
[24:23] if you be circumcised christ profits you
[24:26] nothing and he's going on to say
[24:27] whatever you put i'll just finish at
[24:30] that person let me jump over here to
[24:32] second corinthians the fourth chapter
[24:34] therefore
[24:35] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[24:37] received mercy we faint not
[24:39] and
[24:40] we don't want to faint be
[24:42] but have renounced the hidden things of
[24:44] dishonesty not walking in craftedness or
[24:47] handling the word of god deceitfully
[24:50] by the manifestations of the truth
[24:52] commending ourselves to every man
[24:56] conscience in the sight of god but if
[24:57] our gospel be hid it's hit to them that
[24:59] are lost you know you you can talk to
[25:02] people all you want if god doesn't
[25:04] put a light on that seat to those people
[25:06] that you're talking to they'll just keep
[25:08] going the way they're going you can't
[25:10] make someone
[25:12] become a christian you can't make
[25:13] someone change but god can do it if you
[25:16] put your hope and trust in a living god
[25:18] and i'll just read a few more and sit
[25:20] down
[25:21] but if our gospel head is hit to them
[25:23] that are lost
[25:24] to whom the god of this world have
[25:26] blinded the minds of them which believe
[25:28] not at least the light of this glorious
[25:30] gospel of christ which is the image of
[25:33] god should shine on to them and he's
[25:36] he's talking about the people he's
[25:37] around at that time but you know today
[25:40] in the world that we live in
[25:42] you talk about the gospel the people you
[25:44] talk about jesus christ before you know
[25:47] they'll be in conversations totally off
[25:49] the word of god but it's a it's just the
[25:52] age
[25:52] that we live in right now it's it's
[25:55] unconsecrated age people don't want to
[25:57] go that extra mile they don't want to
[25:59] get into that baptism of the holy ghost
[26:02] but they push out the things of the
[26:03] world that only the things of christ
[26:06] divide in their hearts and lives so as
[26:08] we go further in this year and the years
[26:11] that are going to come
[26:12] i i know i say it a lot i can't say it
[26:15] enough
[26:16] your only hope is if
[26:18] your heart your life and who you are is
[26:20] in head in jesus christ this morning
[26:23] anything outside of that if you're
[26:25] hoping for anything else outside of that
[26:28] then you're going to be lost i mean
[26:30] you're going to be disappointed let's
[26:31] put it that way
[26:33] you know there's nothing wrong as a
[26:34] young you know i was a young man one
[26:36] time i can only speak you know you
[26:38] desire certain things there's nothing
[26:40] wrong with that as a young man but if
[26:42] those hopes are replacing jesus christ
[26:45] in your life then you're going to be a
[26:46] miserable person if you put everything
[26:50] if you put everything that you are in
[26:52] jesus christ this morning god will add
[26:55] those things that he wants you to have
[26:56] or the things you desire but being
[26:59] they'll be in the time that god wants
[27:01] them for you and not what you're pushing
[27:03] for you know i can say that because i'm
[27:05] an older man and i know that i've spent
[27:08] some times in my life pushing forward in
[27:10] things
[27:11] that they don't mean anything you know
[27:13] maybe it wasn't something i should have
[27:15] pushed that forward in to doing but
[27:18] everything we do this morning or
[27:20] anything that i do i want god to lead me
[27:22] in it and not be my own strength but his
[27:25] strength that's leading me
[27:27] brother david
[27:34] you love him this morning let's stand if
[27:36] we could and appreciated that this
[27:38] morning

[31:15] over the goodness of god
[31:17] and the testimonies and you know what
[31:19] was really outstanding to me and you
[31:21] know the bible talks about we need to be
[31:23] as a little child
[31:25] as bill troy's daughter testified and
[31:27] said brother branham was talking to her
[31:30] and you know we can't get nothing from
[31:33] god if we're not listening for him to
[31:35] talk to us this morning
[31:37] and i i thought you know lord and then i
[31:39] began to think about brother perry green
[31:41] he said that brother brandon spoke to
[31:42] him
[31:43] that morning he said because when
[31:44] brother brandon come out to preach he
[31:46] said good morning friends
[31:47] he said i considered myself his friend
[31:50] and i thought you know lord
[31:53] i want to be your friend this morning
[31:54] and i just so appreciate you this
[31:56] morning this just just love him just
[31:59] been thinking about it and i thought
[32:00] lord
[32:01] you know there's just nothing like
[32:03] expressing what god does for you
[32:06] and sometimes you know you say well
[32:08] why should i tell someone it helps them
[32:10] it gives them courage
[32:12] it gives them strength
[32:14] because when they're down they can say
[32:16] brother tommy look what god done for him
[32:20] if he'll do it for him he'll do it for
[32:21] me

[52:01] well david brother david caught me when
[52:02] it came in the door i hadn't even
[52:03] thought about singing and i know i
[52:04] should probably think about it because
[52:06] he does it every time but
[52:08] and then i'm sitting in the pew and
[52:09] audrey said i'll sing with you and
[52:10] that's really rare i mean rare as hen's
[52:12] teeth so
[52:14] we're i'm happy that she's gonna sing
[52:17] this song eat as well with my soul
[52:18] everyone knows but
[52:20] if you give me just a minute i could
[52:21] give you the story behind it as best i
[52:23] can recall it's been a long time since i
[52:24] read it but i remember as a young man
[52:27] knowing horatio spafford was inspired to
[52:29] sing this because he lost
[52:30] a little girl at sea there
[52:32] and when he crossed that spot that's
[52:33] when he received inspiration but there's
[52:35] more to it and you all may know i'm
[52:36] sorry if it's something you're familiar
[52:38] with but
[52:39] when i heard the whole story it's very
[52:41] pretty incredible and it started with
[52:43] her ratio had of one boy and three girls
[52:46] and he lost his little boy
[52:49] it to it was some kind of i don't some
[52:51] kind of a sickness that lost a little
[52:52] boy when he was just a young guy i don't
[52:53] think he was even maybe three years old
[52:56] but he lost his son and then just radon
[52:57] it was one thing after another raid on
[52:59] the heels of that be kind of like the
[53:00] trials of job you know just one after
[53:02] another but right on the heels of that
[53:04] losing his boy was the great chicago
[53:06] fire and that was 1871.
[53:09] horatio spafford was a businessman in
[53:10] chicago and he had a lot of holdings
[53:12] right on the lake front there and
[53:14] everything he had was burnt to the
[53:15] ground all the commercial buildings and
[53:17] everything that he owned was destroyed
[53:19] in that great chicago fire
[53:21] so they
[53:22] planned to just to kind of get away from
[53:24] they were still grieving from having
[53:25] lost their boy
[53:27] and then the great fire and so just to
[53:29] get away he was taking his family and
[53:30] they were going over to england to be in
[53:33] services with dwight moody actually and
[53:36] so they had booked their passage on the
[53:38] ship and the day before they were to
[53:40] leave on their on the ship
[53:42] he the city commissioner came to his
[53:45] door and said tomorrow we're having a
[53:47] meeting to determine property rights on
[53:49] the lakeshore and horizon said well i
[53:51] won't be here i'm leaving with my family
[53:54] and the gentleman said if you're not
[53:55] here we can't guarantee that you'll own
[53:57] anything when you get back if you're not
[53:59] here to show us the maps and tell us
[54:00] what belongs to you and so horatio sent
[54:03] his family on ahead the next day and he
[54:05] said i'll follow on the following ship
[54:08] the next day or the next whenever the
[54:10] next one sailed
[54:11] but that ship then that had his wife and
[54:13] three daughters on was in a in in the
[54:16] fog and and crashed into another ship i
[54:18] believe it went down it was incredible
[54:20] maybe 12 minutes that the ship sank and
[54:24] horatio received a telegram
[54:26] when the when the people that were
[54:28] rescued were rescued from his wife and
[54:30] she said saved alone so his three
[54:33] daughters all perished in that
[54:38] so out of those kind of hardships you
[54:40] know comes
[54:41] that's where we get this song it's 150
[54:43] years old now
[54:45] but he boarded ship then the next ship
[54:48] that sailed and he asked the captain to
[54:49] please call him when they passed the
[54:51] spot where his daughters lost their
[54:53] lives and
[54:58] so it was two in the morning when the
[54:59] captain
[55:01] called him from his room and he went up
[55:03] and stood on the
[55:05] rail of the ship it was the atlantic
[55:06] ocean looking out over the cold atlantic
[55:08] and
[55:10] and this is the spot where his daughters
[55:12] perished and this is when at that moment
[55:14] the inspiration
[55:15] for this song
[55:18] came to racial spafford when peace like
[55:20] a river attendeth my way and in the good
[55:23] times he said when sorrows like sea
[55:25] billows roll
[55:26] whatever my lot whatever lot we have in
[55:28] life
[55:30] we can say it as well
[55:33] with our soul
[55:35] [Music]
[55:39] hallelujah
[55:42] well when peace
[55:49] attendeth
[55:51] my way
[55:54] or when
[55:55] sorrows like sea
[55:59] billows
[56:03] [Music]
[56:10] thou hast
[56:12] taught me
[56:14] to
[56:16] [Music]

[56:37] [Music]
[56:41] it is well

[56:47] with
[56:49] my soul
[56:50] [Music]
[56:54] and though satan

[1:02:06] one or two anyway
[1:02:08] happy to be a christian this morning
[1:02:09] amen amen that's good god's certainly
[1:02:12] been good to us and
[1:02:14] been another hot week but uh we've we've
[1:02:16] persevered and endured and
[1:02:18] and
[1:02:19] now we've come to receive and
[1:02:21] what god has in store for us on this
[1:02:23] sunday that we could come and worship
[1:02:24] and fellowship around the word and and i
[1:02:27] hope you've come with expectations
[1:02:29] to receive
[1:02:31] um if you've just come because it's
[1:02:33] sunday morning and it's a routine and
[1:02:34] it's a habit well i i fear that you'll
[1:02:37] probably leave
[1:02:38] just as you did last week as a routine
[1:02:41] but if you come and say lord what do you
[1:02:43] have for me today and
[1:02:45] what can what can i receive from you
[1:02:46] what can i what can i get from you that
[1:02:48] i can draw closer to you this morning
[1:02:51] you'll get something from god just turn
[1:02:53] in your bibles if you would to the book
[1:02:55] of exodus i'm going to read from a
[1:02:56] couple of places
[1:02:58] i want to first go to exodus 14.
[1:03:08] i'll also be reading out of ecclesiastes
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:11] chapter 3.
[1:03:18] so i'm going to read
[1:03:21] verses 21 and 22 out of exodus 14
[1:03:26] 21-22
[1:03:28] and moses stretched out his hand over
[1:03:30] the sea and the lord caused the sea to
[1:03:31] go back by a strong east wind
[1:03:35] all that night and made the sea dry land
[1:03:39] and the waters were divided
[1:03:41] and the children of israel went into the
[1:03:43] midst of the sea upon the dry ground and
[1:03:45] the waters were a wall unto them on
[1:03:48] their right hand
[1:03:50] and on their left
[1:03:52] it's an amazing scene there
[1:03:54] quite quite an amazing scene what god
[1:03:56] can do
[1:03:58] when he's when he's called on the scene
[1:04:01] let's turn in ecclesiastes if we could
[1:04:03] chapter three
[1:04:06] if you got your scofield bible that's uh
[1:04:09] on page 698 is where you'll find that
[1:04:15] and looking at this here in in this
[1:04:17] portion of scripture here
[1:04:19] um
[1:04:20] the author as we know is unknown they
[1:04:22] say in in this book but most
[1:04:24] make reference to solomon
[1:04:26] and he's telling us that there is an
[1:04:27] appointed time there's an appointed
[1:04:29] season for everything in our life
[1:04:31] there's a time for every activity
[1:04:33] there's a time for every event
[1:04:35] good or bad everything that happens to
[1:04:37] us everywhere we go every trial we go
[1:04:39] through
[1:04:40] every happy moment every sad moment
[1:04:43] and it tells us it has a purpose
[1:04:45] and everything that on this earth has an
[1:04:48] appointed time and
[1:04:49] all happens in such an orderly manner
[1:04:51] and sometimes we may not understand what
[1:04:54] we're going through we may not
[1:04:55] understand the things that's happening
[1:04:56] but i want you to know this morning that
[1:04:58] god is fully aware
[1:05:01] god is fully
[1:05:02] uh knowledgeable of what we're going
[1:05:04] through
[1:05:05] and he knows exactly how to step on the
[1:05:07] scene and he knows exactly when to step
[1:05:10] on the scene
[1:05:11] he says uh god is the alpha and the
[1:05:13] omega
[1:05:14] so he's the beginning and the end
[1:05:17] and in the beginning of the book it says
[1:05:20] in the beginning
[1:05:21] and at the end of the book it says the
[1:05:23] grace in revelations the grace of our
[1:05:25] lord jesus christ be with you all amen
[1:05:27] so he's ending it there so from a human
[1:05:29] standpoint before we get into scripture
[1:05:31] but from a human standpoint there's a
[1:05:33] beginning and an end but god is eternal
[1:05:37] and that's the good thing about god is
[1:05:39] he doesn't look at time the way we look
[1:05:40] at time
[1:05:42] so read with me here in ecclesiastes 3.
[1:05:45] to everything there's a season and a
[1:05:47] time to every purpose under the heaven a
[1:05:49] time to be born a time to die a time to
[1:05:52] plan a time to pluck up that which is
[1:05:54] planted
[1:05:55] a time to kill a time to heal a time to
[1:05:57] break down a time to build up
[1:06:00] a time to weep and a time to laugh
[1:06:02] a time to mourn a time to dance
[1:06:05] a time to cast away stones a time to
[1:06:07] gather stones together
[1:06:09] a time to embrace and a time to refrain
[1:06:12] from embracing
[1:06:14] a time to get
[1:06:16] a time to lose
[1:06:17] a time to keep and a time to cast away
[1:06:20] a time to rend a time to sow
[1:06:23] a time to keep silent a time to speak
[1:06:26] a time to love a time to hate a time of
[1:06:28] war and a time of peace
[1:06:30] what prophet hath he that worketh in
[1:06:32] that word wherein he laboreth i have
[1:06:35] seen the travail which god has given
[1:06:38] to the sons of men to be exercised in it
[1:06:41] he hath made everything beautiful in his
[1:06:43] time
[1:06:44] also he has set the world in their heart
[1:06:47] so that man can find out the work that
[1:06:50] god maketh from the beginning
[1:06:52] to the end so
[1:06:54] this morning if we could
[1:06:56] on god's perfect time let us pray
[1:06:59] heavenly father we come before you this
[1:07:01] morning with expectations and
[1:07:04] with
[1:07:05] hearts lord that's hungering to for the
[1:07:07] word
[1:07:08] uh that would get us through the
[1:07:09] situations we go through on a day-to-day
[1:07:11] basis lord we know we're living in a
[1:07:12] trying hour a trying time
[1:07:15] but lord we know that you're more than
[1:07:16] able to see it through each situation
[1:07:18] that we have to go through father and we
[1:07:20] know that you have a time you have a
[1:07:22] place you have a an appointed set time
[1:07:25] that you come and meet us in situations
[1:07:27] that that we don't understand sometimes
[1:07:29] or situations that we go through we know
[1:07:32] that you come on the scene at just the
[1:07:34] right time and we want to look at a few
[1:07:36] of those things this morning lord
[1:07:38] lord we just ask that you would step
[1:07:39] into the
[1:07:40] vessel this morning as i'm just an empty
[1:07:42] vessel with broken notes but lord you
[1:07:44] know each and every need of the people
[1:07:46] sitting here this morning lord and we
[1:07:48] just ask that you administer to those
[1:07:50] needs whether it be uh
[1:07:52] encouragement whether it's needs of
[1:07:54] healing whether it's needs of uh just a
[1:07:56] closer walk with you or whether it's the
[1:07:58] to restore the joy of our salvation
[1:08:00] whatever the need would be this morning
[1:08:01] lord we just ask that you would move on
[1:08:03] the scene
[1:08:04] we just want to say we love you we
[1:08:05] appreciate you and thank you for all you
[1:08:07] do for us in jesus name amen
[1:08:11] so you can have your seats
[1:08:13] so as we read these scriptures
[1:08:17] we look at these scriptures and we learn
[1:08:18] that these seasons have been divinely
[1:08:20] placed within our lives
[1:08:23] by god almighty and we can clearly
[1:08:25] identify with this description of our
[1:08:28] life and and we see in life we move from
[1:08:31] birth to childhood to adolescence to
[1:08:34] adulthood to old age and finally to
[1:08:38] death and brothers and sisters through
[1:08:40] this whole walk of life god is fully in
[1:08:42] control
[1:08:44] god places certain people in your life
[1:08:47] god places certain jobs in your life
[1:08:49] he'll send you down a certain path for a
[1:08:51] career in your life he'll allow certain
[1:08:54] obstacles in your life he'll also allow
[1:08:56] certain victories in your life
[1:08:59] think about it god allows you to love
[1:09:01] someone but then he also allows you to
[1:09:04] suffer the loss of a loved one
[1:09:07] and god knows
[1:09:09] one thing i know that god knows is the
[1:09:12] end from the beginning there's no
[1:09:14] surprises to god
[1:09:17] we listen to what the prophet said here
[1:09:18] and he says god know the end from the
[1:09:21] beginning therefore he could plan
[1:09:24] everything
[1:09:25] he could plan everything that it would
[1:09:27] work out just to his glory
[1:09:31] to his glory our life here is not to
[1:09:34] bring any glory to us it's not to lift
[1:09:37] us up on a pedestal it's not to give you
[1:09:39] the greatest career but this life here
[1:09:41] on earth is so that god can be used to
[1:09:44] show his glory
[1:09:47] and he says and that'll give us courage
[1:09:49] to know that no matter what comes or
[1:09:51] goes
[1:09:52] god is making everything listen now the
[1:09:56] clock is ticking just exactly on
[1:10:00] time
[1:10:04] you know i i like watches
[1:10:08] and you know what watchmakers and
[1:10:09] clockmakers
[1:10:11] they all strive to have the perfect
[1:10:13] watch that keeps perfect time
[1:10:16] and they'll go to great measures to try
[1:10:18] to enhance the internal parts of these
[1:10:20] watches and and to make them click just
[1:10:22] perfect so that they never lose time
[1:10:24] and they want it to be so so precise
[1:10:28] and i look at my watch
[1:10:30] this is the watch that i wanted for
[1:10:32] years
[1:10:33] i i i just had a desire for this watch
[1:10:36] for years and years and years
[1:10:38] and finally i got this watch and what i
[1:10:40] liked about this watch my parents gave
[1:10:42] it to me as a gift one year for
[1:10:44] christmas and i cherish this watch
[1:10:46] but what i like about it is it's a it's
[1:10:48] a citizen's echo drive
[1:10:51] atomic
[1:10:52] watch
[1:10:54] and so what that means is
[1:10:56] this watch right here it
[1:10:58] it senses atomic time in 26 world cities
[1:11:03] and has radio controlled accuracy in
[1:11:05] five zones
[1:11:07] it never needs a battery
[1:11:10] it runs off sunlight
[1:11:13] so every every time when the time
[1:11:15] changes
[1:11:16] this watch sends a signal to colorado
[1:11:20] and it resets itself i've never had to
[1:11:22] set this clock for daylight savings time
[1:11:24] i've never had to turn it back move it
[1:11:26] forward i've never had to put a battery
[1:11:28] in it and it's just that precise
[1:11:31] and as human beings we live in such a
[1:11:34] fast-paced world
[1:11:36] this time is important to us because we
[1:11:38] have appointments we have deadlines we
[1:11:40] have schedules we have meetings and if
[1:11:42] we miss something it just messes up our
[1:11:44] whole day don't it
[1:11:46] it can ruin your day and it just sets
[1:11:48] you into atonement man i missed it and i
[1:11:51] didn't make it here i didn't make it
[1:11:52] there
[1:11:53] my wife she she missed an appointment
[1:11:56] it was western's part of his graduation
[1:11:58] deal it was something simple something
[1:12:00] easy she missed it it ruined her day i
[1:12:03] mean ruined
[1:12:05] tears
[1:12:07] squall and bawling and west is like it
[1:12:09] wasn't a big deal
[1:12:11] but to her
[1:12:13] it was a big deal it was an appointment
[1:12:15] so brothers and sisters god sees our
[1:12:17] whole life
[1:12:19] from the womb to the tomb
[1:12:21] and he is aware of what we're going
[1:12:23] through and he's orchestrating it all
[1:12:26] so listen to what he says he says
[1:12:27] sometimes we get weary we get upset we
[1:12:30] get hastily
[1:12:31] we think oh i must do this and i must do
[1:12:34] that he said but remember god's clock
[1:12:38] will be exactly on time he said these
[1:12:42] things are to be that way is to be done
[1:12:44] according to his knowledge his great
[1:12:46] knowledge his foreknowledge for by
[1:12:48] foreknowledge he could predestinate
[1:12:52] we try to place people here and there
[1:12:54] and put in and take out and we try to
[1:12:56] make the rules we don't make the rules
[1:12:58] we have to follow the rules god does the
[1:13:00] rule making he says it's god doesn't
[1:13:03] predestinate by his desire he's not
[1:13:05] willing that any should perish but by
[1:13:06] his foreknowledge he knew who would
[1:13:09] accept it and who would not
[1:13:11] and listen what he says he says
[1:13:12] therefore he can make everything work
[1:13:15] according to his big time clock that's
[1:13:18] ticking away
[1:13:20] for he could foretell the end from the
[1:13:22] beginning
[1:13:26] so you mean to tell me
[1:13:29] millions of people around the world
[1:13:33] and god is orchestrating every minute
[1:13:36] every second of every day
[1:13:40] we serve almighty god
[1:13:43] we serve almighty god and he's never
[1:13:45] late to a single appointment
[1:13:48] he's never late to any event
[1:13:51] any tragedy you go through any hardship
[1:13:54] you go through any challenge you're
[1:13:56] going through god is right there beside
[1:13:58] you along the way every step of the way
[1:14:03] now you say well i don't see him i don't
[1:14:05] feel him
[1:14:06] but let me tell you he's there
[1:14:08] and he's orchestrating
[1:14:10] he's making your situation happen
[1:14:15] there's a story i read about an old dog
[1:14:18] and this old dog fell into a dry well
[1:14:21] and you may have heard this story it's
[1:14:22] been around for a while
[1:14:24] and then a farmer come by and he looked
[1:14:26] and he seen the dog and heard the doggy
[1:14:29] up and down in the hole there in the you
[1:14:31] know in the whale wanting to get out and
[1:14:33] the old farmer looked and he's like man
[1:14:35] i don't know what i'm gonna do i guess
[1:14:36] i'm just gonna have to fill this thing
[1:14:37] in and just bury the dog alive
[1:14:40] so he goes and he gets him a wagon full
[1:14:42] of dirt and he pulls up to the well and
[1:14:44] he takes a shovelful and he throws it
[1:14:46] down into the hole of the well
[1:14:49] the dirt falls on top of the dog makes
[1:14:52] the dog mad the dog shakes the dirt
[1:14:54] falls off onto the floor
[1:14:57] dog runs in a circle he throws another
[1:15:00] shovel in the dog shakes
[1:15:02] the dirt falls off in the floor
[1:15:04] and he continues to do this over and
[1:15:06] over and over for over an hour and
[1:15:09] before you know it because the dog is in
[1:15:11] this situation this dire situation
[1:15:14] and it doesn't look like there's any way
[1:15:16] to get out slowly the ground is building
[1:15:19] up beneath him where he's shaking the
[1:15:21] dirt off
[1:15:22] and before you know it he jumps out of
[1:15:24] the well licks the farmer in the face
[1:15:26] and is so thankful that he sees his
[1:15:27] farmer and this owner again and brother
[1:15:30] says that's the way it is our life we
[1:15:31] don't understand sometimes how to get
[1:15:33] out of the well of a situation we're in
[1:15:37] but god will begin to find a way god
[1:15:39] will make a way and a purpose
[1:15:41] to get us through to get us out of the
[1:15:44] hole and sometimes we find ourselves in
[1:15:50] see sometimes life gives us crushing
[1:15:52] blows
[1:15:54] yeah
[1:15:55] crushing blows after blow after blow the
[1:15:58] song we sing brother russell's saying
[1:16:02] that's a crushing blow
[1:16:06] a crushing blow how do you overcome that
[1:16:09] he overcome because god was standing
[1:16:11] beside him all along the way
[1:16:16] and you say what was the purpose
[1:16:19] we sang a song that was 150 years old
[1:16:22] today
[1:16:23] because it placed a purpose in our
[1:16:25] hearts
[1:16:26] to tell us that no matter what we go
[1:16:28] through in life
[1:16:30] it is well
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:35] time and time again
[1:16:37] through deep suffering the bible can
[1:16:39] find reasons
[1:16:41] to show us pain and suffering that
[1:16:43] people went through in their life
[1:16:45] sometimes we suffer because of the
[1:16:46] nature of sin
[1:16:50] we find ourselves a sinful living
[1:16:51] sometimes in the suffering begins to
[1:16:53] come on and and it builds up and you
[1:16:55] find yourself suffering
[1:16:57] sometimes we suffer
[1:16:59] just for the fact that god is wanting to
[1:17:01] prove who he is
[1:17:04] you ever realize that we suffer
[1:17:06] because god is trying to show his
[1:17:08] character through us
[1:17:11] and maybe god is showcasing us to satan
[1:17:14] like he did job
[1:17:17] did you think about that
[1:17:20] and i thought about this it's been on my
[1:17:21] mind all week to to speak on this
[1:17:25] and i thought to myself man why am i why
[1:17:28] lord are you directing me to go this
[1:17:29] direction because it seems like
[1:17:31] everything is smooth right now it seems
[1:17:33] like the testimony started out on
[1:17:35] wednesday was phenomenal people's been
[1:17:37] coming through stuff people's giving
[1:17:39] glory and honor and praising god for the
[1:17:41] good things but let me tell you it's
[1:17:42] always right around the corner
[1:17:45] you never know what is right around the
[1:17:47] corner no doubt job here
[1:17:50] he felt all alone
[1:17:53] and desperate for some kind of relief
[1:17:56] and it's normal for us when we go
[1:17:58] through things in life that we feel
[1:18:00] desperate that we feel alone that we
[1:18:03] feel like we're suffering and we feel
[1:18:04] isolated but we have to be able to
[1:18:06] remember that god never leaves us and
[1:18:09] god never forsakes us
[1:18:13] have you ever found yourself in a
[1:18:14] desperate situation
[1:18:16] hands should be up all building we've
[1:18:18] all been there we've had times that we
[1:18:19] wonder
[1:18:20] how am i going to get out of this what
[1:18:21] am i going to do my back's against the
[1:18:23] wall there's no way out i've been
[1:18:24] painted into a corner and i can't go
[1:18:28] we've been there rocking a hard place
[1:18:30] maybe it was financial troubles
[1:18:32] financial problems maybe it was family
[1:18:34] problems maybe it was your health
[1:18:37] it goes over and over things happen
[1:18:39] maybe your faith is faltering maybe you
[1:18:41] just don't didn't have that fire for god
[1:18:43] like you once had
[1:18:45] maybe you find yourself that your hope
[1:18:47] has kind of halted away
[1:18:49] that you don't even know there's no hope
[1:18:51] for tomorrow
[1:18:53] maybe you're sitting there and your
[1:18:54] victory's vanished
[1:18:56] you know it's a sad feeling when you
[1:18:58] lose your vic
[1:19:00] when you lose your victory you're almost
[1:19:01] in a defeated state of mind
[1:19:03] but brothers and sisters is in that time
[1:19:05] right there when god steps onto the
[1:19:08] scene because god's timing is perfect it
[1:19:11] may not feel like it it may feel like
[1:19:13] the pressure is mounting you may be
[1:19:15] suffering family problems your kids
[1:19:17] maybe they're going every direction
[1:19:18] you're wondering why are they going this
[1:19:20] way what what did i do god what did i do
[1:19:23] to send my children away from the word
[1:19:25] of god
[1:19:26] it may be that you have nothing to do
[1:19:28] with it at all but god may be trying to
[1:19:29] mold character into them
[1:19:32] because god's timing we can't understand
[1:19:36] when you heard the testimonies how did
[1:19:37] brother glenn come in contact with
[1:19:39] brother sean
[1:19:41] at a specific time
[1:19:44] a specific place
[1:19:46] a specific event there was a specific
[1:19:48] conversation that took place that drew
[1:19:51] them to wonder and want to know what's
[1:19:53] going on at evening like tabernacle
[1:19:57] what was it that got a fire started in
[1:19:59] brother tommy
[1:20:01] hardship
[1:20:03] was hardship wasn't it brother tommy
[1:20:06] it was painful it hurt but god put him
[1:20:09] in a situation that he can now be a
[1:20:12] witness
[1:20:13] that he can now be a living testimony
[1:20:15] and a witness and show what god is
[1:20:17] capable of doing and if we think about
[1:20:19] our thoughts it goes on and on and on
[1:20:22] that we can get our victory back we
[1:20:24] don't have to be without it
[1:20:26] but when we get our back against the
[1:20:28] wall
[1:20:30] that's when we have to call on jesus
[1:20:33] when our backs against the wall is when
[1:20:35] we have to depend on jesus
[1:20:37] you look here in exodus 14 what we were
[1:20:40] talking about the children of israel
[1:20:42] they find themselves in a desperate
[1:20:43] situation they're trapped
[1:20:45] nowhere to turn
[1:20:48] see the picture in your mind trapped
[1:20:50] with nowhere to go no way out they're
[1:20:52] caught between pharaoh and this deep
[1:20:55] red sea
[1:20:57] and the prophet said i can see them come
[1:20:59] up to that red sea
[1:21:01] listen
[1:21:03] he said god had his map drawn out
[1:21:07] you think man moses made a wrong turn
[1:21:09] moses wasn't following what god wanted
[1:21:11] to do or he would let him a different
[1:21:12] direction no no no no
[1:21:14] the problem is that god had his map
[1:21:16] drawed out
[1:21:18] he said and he was going to take him
[1:21:20] there and he moved them right up to the
[1:21:22] red sea no way at all they could cross
[1:21:25] it
[1:21:27] and he said here was pharaoh's army
[1:21:29] and the mountains they wrote armies
[1:21:31] behind them and the mountains on each
[1:21:33] side of them and the red sea in front of
[1:21:35] them
[1:21:38] you ever been there
[1:21:40] you ever been there when you look all
[1:21:42] around you the world is closing in on
[1:21:44] you can you imagine the children of
[1:21:46] israel as they look behind them and see
[1:21:48] the the dusty billows of chariots after
[1:21:50] chariot after chariot coming to take
[1:21:52] their head off
[1:21:57] and he said
[1:21:59] god looked down
[1:22:01] he said and he's seeing a pathway
[1:22:03] through the bottom of the sea
[1:22:05] he said there was his children right
[1:22:07] there needing the promise taking god at
[1:22:10] his word
[1:22:11] brother sisters god will show up
[1:22:14] on time
[1:22:16] don't think about your time
[1:22:19] don't think about your situation
[1:22:22] don't think about the diagnosis
[1:22:24] don't think about the prognosis
[1:22:27] don't think about the way
[1:22:29] the situation is getting out of hand
[1:22:32] think about god
[1:22:34] on time
[1:22:35] he said god looked down through that
[1:22:37] pillar of fire with angered eyes
[1:22:41] that's what our god does
[1:22:44] when he sees satan picking on you
[1:22:47] when he sees satan
[1:22:48] trying to get you in a situation that
[1:22:50] you can't get out of god looks down
[1:22:52] through the pillar of fire with angered
[1:22:54] eyes
[1:22:56] and he said he looked through those
[1:22:57] angered eyes and the sea became scared
[1:23:04] that's my god
[1:23:05] that's your god when something's on your
[1:23:08] back god looks down through the pillar
[1:23:10] fire with angered eyes and says part
[1:23:12] your way satan my child's coming through
[1:23:21] i can assure you there be times in your
[1:23:23] life
[1:23:24] you're going to see that red sea
[1:23:28] you're going to be at a red sea crossing
[1:23:32] and moses and his and god's people
[1:23:34] arrived at the shore of the red sea
[1:23:37] the egyptians all coming behind them
[1:23:41] what happened
[1:23:43] if we look back into the scripture here
[1:23:45] and we read
[1:23:47] it says they want to go back to the past
[1:23:53] why moses we tried to tell you when we
[1:23:55] were in egypt
[1:23:57] we tried to tell you we were we were
[1:23:58] okay there we were content we didn't ask
[1:24:01] for none of this moses
[1:24:06] if you're honest in your heart
[1:24:08] you're a christian you've been a
[1:24:09] christian for very long
[1:24:11] maybe as a young christian you get in a
[1:24:12] situation
[1:24:14] and you want to question god
[1:24:16] god i didn't i didn't ask for this i
[1:24:18] didn't sign up for this when i said i
[1:24:21] do at the altar
[1:24:24] i didn't ask for this hardship
[1:24:27] i didn't ask for my family to be torn
[1:24:29] apart i didn't ask for financial woes
[1:24:33] health issues
[1:24:36] death in the family
[1:24:40] i didn't ask for this
[1:24:42] and here they come up to this point
[1:24:45] and they say why did you bring us here
[1:24:49] what was it looking back to the past
[1:24:52] and moaning and groaning
[1:24:54] moses and says we told you in egypt
[1:25:00] this is what was going to happen
[1:25:02] this is what was going to happen
[1:25:05] and you know
[1:25:06] sometimes it's easier
[1:25:09] to fight under the temptation to want to
[1:25:10] go back to egypt
[1:25:15] you know i speak honestly to you always
[1:25:18] do i'll tell you honestly what what i'm
[1:25:20] feeling
[1:25:21] but sometimes it's easier
[1:25:24] in our minds
[1:25:26] to think i'll just go back to egypt
[1:25:29] i'll go back to the way i was in the
[1:25:30] world
[1:25:31] it was easy
[1:25:33] it was simple
[1:25:35] no problems
[1:25:37] do you think devil the devil's going to
[1:25:39] chase you he's got you
[1:25:41] no
[1:25:42] pharaoh's not coming after you if you're
[1:25:44] already building up building his temples
[1:25:47] pharaoh's not coming after you if you're
[1:25:48] already building his shrines and the
[1:25:51] sphinx and the pyramids and you're
[1:25:53] giving your day day after day after day
[1:25:56] laboring for satan
[1:25:57] pharaoh's not coming after you because
[1:25:59] he's already got you
[1:26:02] the world is not worth
[1:26:04] what it's made out to be
[1:26:07] the life was better for the children of
[1:26:09] israel once they got out of egypt
[1:26:12] was it instantaneous
[1:26:14] no
[1:26:15] were there more hardships was there
[1:26:17] hunger were there thirsting
[1:26:20] over and over and over trial after trial
[1:26:22] they began to get into but the problem
[1:26:24] was they were accustomed to slavery
[1:26:28] and if we're not careful we find
[1:26:30] ourselves accustomed to the slavery we
[1:26:33] was in ourselves
[1:26:38] you know if you're serving satan you're
[1:26:40] a slave
[1:26:44] if you're doing the things that satan
[1:26:46] has got you bound down to
[1:26:49] you've got task masters over you
[1:26:52] you've got someone telling you what to
[1:26:53] do when to do it and you're just like a
[1:26:55] little puppy yes sir yes sir yes sir
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:01] why do people want to go back to that
[1:27:03] lifestyle
[1:27:05] why do people want to go back under the
[1:27:07] bondage of of drinking and carousing and
[1:27:10] drugs and alcohol why do they want that
[1:27:13] a filth
[1:27:15] pornography
[1:27:18] broken homes broken marriages why do
[1:27:21] they want to go back to that
[1:27:30] accustom to slavery
[1:27:33] comfortable
[1:27:34] with slavery
[1:27:40] sometimes we have a tendency to look
[1:27:41] back
[1:27:44] at egypt instead of seeing through holy
[1:27:47] ghost-filled eyes of where god is trying
[1:27:49] to get us to
[1:27:53] you know the prophet said it over and
[1:27:55] over and over nobody ever said this is
[1:27:56] gonna be a flowery bit of ease
[1:27:59] nobody ever says once you give your life
[1:28:01] to god
[1:28:02] man now you're in cruise control
[1:28:05] if they told you that they lied to you
[1:28:08] because that's not the case
[1:28:10] it's hard
[1:28:13] it's a challenge
[1:28:16] it's a daily devotion but it's something
[1:28:18] that god has called his people to
[1:28:22] overcome
[1:28:23] it's something that god has placed in
[1:28:25] you
[1:28:26] to overcome these things
[1:28:28] it's funny how we concentrate on the way
[1:28:31] things used to be
[1:28:32] you know memories are good to in a
[1:28:34] certain extent but but when we fail to
[1:28:36] look at where god's trying to get us to
[1:28:38] our memories became a weight
[1:28:41] around our ankles
[1:28:44] i think i'm going to go to church today
[1:28:45] but oh
[1:28:48] there's a there's a there's a game i
[1:28:50] want to go to
[1:28:52] and then you've got this ball and chain
[1:28:54] stuck behind you you know man there's
[1:28:56] some meetings going on i want to go to
[1:28:58] those meetings and i want to go see
[1:28:59] these people but oh
[1:29:01] ah
[1:29:02] i've got to be over here
[1:29:05] because my heart's telling me i want to
[1:29:07] do this i want to do that you can put
[1:29:09] whatever your challenge is in that
[1:29:11] sentence
[1:29:18] people just have a hard time overcoming
[1:29:25] but i don't understand why because the
[1:29:26] lord has constantly proven himself to us
[1:29:31] he's constantly taking us through
[1:29:33] dangers seen and unseen
[1:29:36] you know many times things happen and
[1:29:38] you don't understand why
[1:29:40] maybe there was a roadblock or something
[1:29:41] held you up 15 minutes just to get an
[1:29:44] hour down the road and find out that
[1:29:45] there was a 10 car pile up
[1:29:50] i don't even think i told you it's about
[1:29:51] this i told her about what i saw but i
[1:29:53] didn't tell her what a what really
[1:29:54] happened i don't think i was going from
[1:29:56] hopkinsville
[1:29:57] to clarksville on 24
[1:30:00] and i was in a blazing hurry
[1:30:02] too many things to do too many things
[1:30:04] going on driving down the interstate
[1:30:06] something was holding me up in hopkins
[1:30:08] we all couldn't get around this car
[1:30:10] these two cars were side by side don't
[1:30:12] that aggravate you they won't let you
[1:30:14] around and
[1:30:19] finally i got around them
[1:30:22] maybe two miles down the road
[1:30:25] no more than 10 seconds in front of me
[1:30:28] car swiped over in front of another car
[1:30:30] parts start flying everywhere a hose
[1:30:32] flies off of a gas truck i'm talking
[1:30:34] with those big metal eight eight inch
[1:30:37] pipes that they fill up the service
[1:30:39] tanks with
[1:30:40] the stuff debris is flying everywhere if
[1:30:42] i would have just made it around those
[1:30:44] cars you know who that would have
[1:30:45] probably been
[1:30:48] it would have probably been me
[1:30:50] in a crumpled up mess
[1:30:52] it happened so fast i was part in the
[1:30:54] debris and made it around
[1:30:57] two or three more seconds
[1:30:59] is all it would have took
[1:31:01] but god says
[1:31:03] it's not time for that
[1:31:07] god says i'm mindful of you
[1:31:09] i'm mindful of your day i'm mindful of
[1:31:12] your job i'm mindful of where you're
[1:31:14] going to be when you're going to be
[1:31:15] there so just let me be in control and
[1:31:18] when i'm holding you up just be patient
[1:31:26] god brought the children of israel out
[1:31:28] of bondage
[1:31:31] and you know he brought us out of
[1:31:32] bondage
[1:31:34] because we easily tie everything back to
[1:31:36] history
[1:31:38] but you were in a bondage of sin
[1:31:41] we were in a bondage of unbelief
[1:31:44] and there was a cross called calvary
[1:31:46] where jesus christ went up on that he
[1:31:48] said i'm going to release every one of
[1:31:50] these people who will believe on me john
[1:31:53] 3 16.
[1:31:55] i'm going to release every one of them
[1:31:57] out of slavery every one of them out of
[1:31:59] bondage every one of them can just live
[1:32:01] freely in me and serve me
[1:32:05] but then we look back to egypt
[1:32:11] god says in romans the word says
[1:32:14] be not conformed to this world but be
[1:32:16] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:32:17] that you may prove what is good and
[1:32:19] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:32:23] so how do we let go of the past
[1:32:29] how many can honestly say as we pause
[1:32:31] here for a minute that sometimes the
[1:32:32] past plagues you
[1:32:35] it haunts you
[1:32:37] it can draw at
[1:32:38] you how do we get rid of that how do we
[1:32:41] overcome the past we begin to look
[1:32:43] through faith
[1:32:46] faith will lead us into places we've
[1:32:48] never dreamed possible
[1:32:50] the bible tells us don't be afraid don't
[1:32:52] fear don't allow the enemies to keep you
[1:32:54] in fear
[1:32:56] for fear is not of the lord
[1:33:00] in fact it's just the opposite
[1:33:03] it's the opposite of faith
[1:33:05] what is faith faith is believing faith
[1:33:07] is knowing the unseen is a reality
[1:33:12] so what is fear
[1:33:14] fear is nothing but false evidence
[1:33:16] appearing real
[1:33:18] f-e-a-r false evidence appearing real
[1:33:22] and it's a trick that the enemy has used
[1:33:26] for thousands of years
[1:33:28] to trick our minds it's a trick that he
[1:33:30] uses to get in there to entangle and
[1:33:32] trap us in a snare because it's a mind
[1:33:34] thing
[1:33:37] it's a mind thing that when the devil
[1:33:38] tells you
[1:33:39] you can't overcome
[1:33:42] you can't have a good job
[1:33:44] you can't have a good career
[1:33:46] you can't have a happy home a good
[1:33:48] family a happy marriage
[1:33:51] you'll never get married
[1:33:53] nobody will have you
[1:33:58] it's quiet
[1:33:59] you've heard some of that too huh
[1:34:02] you mean you're you're you're you've
[1:34:04] heard it too because i've heard some of
[1:34:05] those things in my life
[1:34:07] the god that satan tells me you have to
[1:34:10] have fear
[1:34:11] because you'll never be what god wants
[1:34:14] you to be
[1:34:19] god has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:34:22] but a power
[1:34:24] what else does it say of love
[1:34:26] and of a sound mind so no matter what
[1:34:28] the devil tries to plant in this device
[1:34:30] his device of fear and your spirit
[1:34:33] stand boldly on god's promise stand
[1:34:36] boldly on god's word and look to your
[1:34:37] faith
[1:34:39] because the children of israel
[1:34:41] they didn't believe that god would bring
[1:34:43] them out
[1:34:46] they were just going through the motions
[1:34:50] they were just living the day
[1:34:53] hey moses said pack your bags
[1:34:55] okay where are we going
[1:34:58] but over and over and over god tried to
[1:35:02] prove to them who he was in spite of all
[1:35:04] the plagues that they'd cast upon the
[1:35:06] egyptians they didn't believe they that
[1:35:07] god could see them through in spite of
[1:35:10] what god done for them
[1:35:11] they didn't think they could see him
[1:35:13] through
[1:35:15] going through emotions
[1:35:21] fear
[1:35:22] has to be dealt with
[1:35:24] so what did moses say when moses
[1:35:26] recognized this
[1:35:28] when moses recognized this he you look
[1:35:30] at our bibles here moses recognized this
[1:35:34] and the first thing he looks at he says
[1:35:37] unto the people fear not
[1:35:41] and stand still
[1:35:43] fear not and stand still
[1:35:46] because many times we find ourselves
[1:35:48] getting in a hurry
[1:35:51] and we run to and fro and here and there
[1:35:53] and we we're going nowhere so fast
[1:35:59] and god is saying stand
[1:36:02] still
[1:36:03] and and so you ever notice when you get
[1:36:05] into a situation sometimes
[1:36:07] maybe it's a
[1:36:09] get myself in trouble
[1:36:11] maybe it's your better half i'll i'll
[1:36:13] put it that way
[1:36:15] maybe it's a better half
[1:36:17] you're in a situation and she says you
[1:36:19] got to do something
[1:36:21] hurry up you got to do something don't
[1:36:23] just stand there do something
[1:36:31] but let me ask you why would we run
[1:36:32] around if we don't know where we're
[1:36:34] going
[1:36:36] because a lot of times that just makes
[1:36:37] the situation worse
[1:36:39] because then you begin to get frantic
[1:36:41] and you begin to panic and you begin to
[1:36:43] get the anxiety built up and this just
[1:36:45] begins at that vicious cycle of a
[1:36:47] downward spiral that this event is now
[1:36:50] getting worse than what it ever was
[1:36:55] don't let me tell you this don't just do
[1:36:58] something just stand there
[1:37:03] about what i said
[1:37:04] don't just do something
[1:37:07] stand there
[1:37:09] they that wait upon the lord
[1:37:12] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:37:14] mount up with wings of the eagles they
[1:37:16] shall run and not be worried they shall
[1:37:17] walk and not faint
[1:37:19] so with waiting comes a renewing of our
[1:37:22] faith with waiting becomes a renewing of
[1:37:24] our strength with waiting we becomes a
[1:37:26] renewing of our zeal and our love and
[1:37:28] our joy and our passion
[1:37:31] with waiting god can show you
[1:37:34] what to do
[1:37:40] listen to this
[1:37:41] prophet's talking about jesus and after
[1:37:43] he just taken five little fishes and
[1:37:47] two biscuits and feather five thousand
[1:37:49] and
[1:37:50] he was hungering and he was looking for
[1:37:52] something to eat and you know the story
[1:37:54] he goes on and he gets out there on the
[1:37:56] boat that night
[1:37:58] and he said it was pitched around like a
[1:38:00] little bottle stopper on the sea
[1:38:04] now listen to what he says
[1:38:06] there were ten thousand devils of the
[1:38:09] sea that swore they would drown him
[1:38:13] did you hear what i said
[1:38:15] ten thousand devils of the sea
[1:38:18] that swore they would drown them
[1:38:22] and you say well that was god they can't
[1:38:24] drown him that was jesus
[1:38:27] listen
[1:38:29] him out there asleep
[1:38:32] was so weak
[1:38:34] how many has ever felt weak
[1:38:37] you felt weak as a christian many times
[1:38:39] we all get there
[1:38:41] he was weak virtue had went out of him
[1:38:45] he was tired from healing and going on
[1:38:48] about that day until the devil said oh
[1:38:50] we got him out here asleep now we're
[1:38:53] gonna drown him
[1:38:57] here's the part that me and you you and
[1:38:59] i can relate to
[1:39:00] he said he was a man
[1:39:04] when he was laying there down there on
[1:39:05] that boat asleep
[1:39:08] tired
[1:39:10] weary
[1:39:11] worn
[1:39:12] frazzled from the day's events
[1:39:16] hungry
[1:39:18] he said but when he walked out there and
[1:39:20] he put his foot up on the
[1:39:23] bow that
[1:39:24] ship i'll be out there with you
[1:39:29] he said when he put his foot up there on
[1:39:31] the bow that on the braille that
[1:39:32] boat and he said what
[1:39:34] peace
[1:39:36] be
[1:39:37] still
[1:39:39] do you see how the whole situation
[1:39:41] changed
[1:39:43] he went from a man that was tired and we
[1:39:46] fury and worn and didn't know if he
[1:39:47] could make it and the dev ten thousand
[1:39:49] devils from the sea was fixing to drown
[1:39:52] and when he walked
[1:39:53] peace be still the whole situation
[1:39:55] changed
[1:40:02] he said the winds and waves obey him
[1:40:04] because he was more than a man
[1:40:07] he was more than a man it was god
[1:40:09] speaking through mortal lips of his son
[1:40:11] hallelujah listen now and listen how
[1:40:13] close he says and when christ was then
[1:40:16] and what christ was then we have
[1:40:18] positionally the same
[1:40:20] powers
[1:40:23] today
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:26] listen now he says granted in jesus
[1:40:29] christ where is the faith of the church
[1:40:31] we have the same powers today no matter
[1:40:34] what storm you're in no matter if the
[1:40:35] sea is tempest no matter if it's up and
[1:40:38] down and you feel like you're fixing to
[1:40:39] be spilt out on the ground or into the
[1:40:41] water
[1:40:42] jesus christ says that same power that i
[1:40:45] had you have
[1:40:49] that's a mighty god we serve
[1:40:56] when we look to our faith and
[1:40:58] we begin to depend on the lord and
[1:41:01] we trust him to
[1:41:02] look to our faith he begins to
[1:41:04] strengthen our hearts
[1:41:08] mind
[1:41:10] when you're standing still he begins to
[1:41:12] strengthen your will
[1:41:13] he begins to strengthen your emotion
[1:41:16] because we're standing still and we're
[1:41:17] trusting in god's word stand still and
[1:41:20] see the salvation of the lord
[1:41:24] when we're able to stand still
[1:41:27] and let god do what he does best
[1:41:31] watch god move
[1:41:32] on your behalf
[1:41:40] why because he said i'll never leave you
[1:41:42] i'll never forsake you
[1:41:44] and it's for
[1:41:45] a purpose
[1:41:47] we don't understand many times why we're
[1:41:49] at the red sea
[1:41:52] and i thought about this red sea
[1:41:54] experience because you know most of the
[1:41:55] people there they weren't even
[1:41:58] believers we've talked about that before
[1:42:02] they were doubters
[1:42:03] so what was the purpose of this red sea
[1:42:06] because god has a plan he had a
[1:42:08] blueprint he said my children have got
[1:42:10] to get over here into the promised land
[1:42:12] somehow because somewhere in the midst
[1:42:15] of these people there is a seed laying
[1:42:17] there
[1:42:18] that is going to be my children in the
[1:42:21] promised land
[1:42:25] so somebody
[1:42:26] had to see this event happen
[1:42:29] can you imagine maybe it was joshua and
[1:42:31] caleb
[1:42:35] maybe they had to see that so that they
[1:42:37] knew that when we come around the corner
[1:42:39] we're more than able to take the city
[1:42:42] it's always leading up to one event so
[1:42:44] in our life things happen
[1:42:47] one time something else happens and it
[1:42:50] encourages you and it builds you and you
[1:42:52] see a testimony and you see a healing
[1:42:54] and you see this next thing you know
[1:42:56] you're the one getting healed
[1:42:59] because you've seen god in
[1:43:02] action
[1:43:03] so no matter what comes our way the
[1:43:05] crossing of the red sea is for a purpose
[1:43:08] it may be it's for your faith to be
[1:43:10] stronger
[1:43:11] maybe it's so that your songs can be
[1:43:12] louder
[1:43:15] maybe
[1:43:16] so that you're frequent
[1:43:21] there's a
[1:43:22] purpose sometimes we look and we
[1:43:26] we've got all kinds of excuses
[1:43:30] all kinds of them
[1:43:32] they come out of everywhere
[1:43:35] satan is the biggest excuse giver
[1:43:42] we'll say it's impossible
[1:43:46] god says all things are possible
[1:43:48] this is scriptures i'm fixing to give
[1:43:49] you
[1:43:50] i'm too tired
[1:43:52] god says i'll give you rest
[1:43:55] nobody loves me
[1:43:57] how many have we ever felt that way
[1:43:59] nobody loves me
[1:44:00] i go to church every sunday nobody ever
[1:44:02] say a word i mean nobody in that place
[1:44:03] loves me
[1:44:06] i'm just a misfit
[1:44:08] would god say
[1:44:10] i love you
[1:44:13] i can't go on
[1:44:15] and god says my grace is sufficient
[1:44:18] i cannot do it
[1:44:20] you can do all things
[1:44:25] i'm unable
[1:44:27] god says i'm able
[1:44:31] i'm not worth it
[1:44:32] god says it'll be worth it
[1:44:34] you see how this just goes on i cannot
[1:44:36] forgive myself
[1:44:38] i forgive you
[1:44:41] i forgive you
[1:44:42] i may not be able to forgive myself for
[1:44:44] things i've done in my past
[1:44:47] and you may not be able to forgive yours
[1:44:48] for things you've done in your past
[1:44:52] people around me may not be able to
[1:44:53] forgive me for things i've done
[1:44:55] in life
[1:44:58] but one person can
[1:45:02] when he says you're forgiven
[1:45:04] it's not only forgiven it's forgotten
[1:45:07] so it no longer hangs over your head
[1:45:10] you're forgiven
[1:45:12] and you say well i i can't afford to do
[1:45:14] it
[1:45:16] and that's an easy one there
[1:45:19] hard times we're in hard times right
[1:45:24] diesel
[1:45:27] we're in hard times i don't i can't
[1:45:29] afford to do it
[1:45:31] what did god say
[1:45:32] i will supply
[1:45:35] some of no all of your needs
[1:45:40] when you need it
[1:45:42] it'll be there
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:48] no doubt job
[1:45:50] job looking back at job here for a
[1:45:52] minute
[1:45:54] no doubt job felt isolated
[1:45:59] felt isolated and far away from god
[1:46:03] but job held steadfastly
[1:46:07] to god's word
[1:46:09] even though he felt abandoned
[1:46:11] even though he knew that god was in
[1:46:14] control
[1:46:16] somebody mentioned job in the song
[1:46:17] service
[1:46:19] i couldn't hear it all but i knew i knew
[1:46:21] job was in my notes
[1:46:23] but i was thinking about job here and
[1:46:25] you know he lost his children he lost
[1:46:27] his wealth he lost his friends he lost
[1:46:29] everything he had in life
[1:46:32] but his wife
[1:46:34] the one who said just curse god and die
[1:46:37] isn't that one of the most astounding
[1:46:39] statements made in the old testament
[1:46:43] just curse god and die job
[1:46:47] she didn't she look at him say job you
[1:46:49] know god has been so good to you
[1:46:52] god has given you and blessed you and
[1:46:54] multiplied uh your your fields and
[1:46:57] multiplied your your cattle and he's
[1:46:59] given you great kids and
[1:47:02] no
[1:47:02] just curse him
[1:47:04] just curse him
[1:47:06] and
[1:47:06] die how would you like to be yoked with
[1:47:09] that one
[1:47:12] that wouldn't sound like too too much of
[1:47:14] a fun marriage
[1:47:19] but
[1:47:20] in book there we read and job says
[1:47:25] but he knows the way that i take
[1:47:27] and when he has tried me
[1:47:32] i shall come out as
[1:47:34] gold
[1:47:39] his wife says curse him
[1:47:41] and die
[1:47:42] and he says no
[1:47:45] once i have been through the the
[1:47:46] harshest of trials
[1:47:48] once i've been through the test of my
[1:47:50] life once i feel like i can't go no more
[1:47:53] that's when i'll be tried as gold
[1:47:58] brothers and sisters i want to be
[1:48:00] as gold
[1:48:01] in the sight of god
[1:48:04] he knew that when the trials were over
[1:48:06] he would emerge from those trials
[1:48:08] stronger
[1:48:09] and and and brighter
[1:48:11] and more passionate about god
[1:48:20] time is about to get away from us it
[1:48:32] if you want to follow along with me
[1:48:33] we'll we'll turn to john 11. i'm just
[1:48:36] going to kind of rehearse this as we
[1:48:38] try to find a place to slow down here
[1:48:42] john chapter 11.
[1:48:44] we talk about god being an all-time
[1:48:47] god
[1:48:48] here was a man named lazarus
[1:48:52] and he was sick
[1:48:54] and lazarus had been laying there sick
[1:48:56] and
[1:48:57] his sister and
[1:48:59] mary and martha martha and mary i should
[1:49:02] say
[1:49:04] they cared so much about lazarus
[1:49:07] and as you read through these scriptures
[1:49:08] you know the prophet said that jesus
[1:49:11] was lazarus buddy
[1:49:16] that's a special kind of a tag right
[1:49:18] there
[1:49:20] lazarus and jesus were buddies
[1:49:23] it was more than just a name in the book
[1:49:25] it was more than just an acquaintance
[1:49:27] over in bethany it was more than that
[1:49:29] but mary martha and lazarus they were
[1:49:32] all close-knit and tight with jesus mary
[1:49:35] is the one that says in the bible that
[1:49:37] washed jesus's feet and dried it with
[1:49:39] her hair that's a special kind of
[1:49:40] connection with this man
[1:49:44] and here he is he's sick
[1:49:46] and they send word to jesus saying he
[1:49:50] who thou lovest
[1:49:52] is sick
[1:49:55] and when jesus heard it he said a
[1:49:57] sickness is not unto death but for the
[1:49:59] glory of god that the son of god might
[1:50:02] be glorified thereby
[1:50:06] and then it begins to go on to tell more
[1:50:07] how jesus loved these three people so so
[1:50:10] closely
[1:50:12] and it says when he had heard therefore
[1:50:13] that he was sick
[1:50:16] he rushed back to bethany to go save him
[1:50:20] no
[1:50:21] it said he abode for two more days
[1:50:26] this is his best friend
[1:50:28] this is his buddy
[1:50:30] these are two of the women that are that
[1:50:31] are close to jesus than anybody any
[1:50:33] other any two women we know in the bible
[1:50:37] and they're begging him come back and
[1:50:38] and help lazarus your friend he's sick
[1:50:40] come back and help him i've got work to
[1:50:42] i'll be i got two days worth of work
[1:50:45] but then after that's done they said uh
[1:50:48] after that he tells his disciples why
[1:50:50] after we've been working for two days
[1:50:51] why don't we go on over into judea
[1:50:55] so see time
[1:50:58] was not a concern
[1:51:00] to jesus
[1:51:01] about lazarus being sick
[1:51:04] now to mary and martha and lazarus it
[1:51:06] was a different story
[1:51:09] put yourself in that situation when it's
[1:51:11] your loved one laying there sick and in
[1:51:13] pain and hurting
[1:51:15] you want to see jesus right there right
[1:51:17] now and on the scene
[1:51:20] when it's you that has a dire situation
[1:51:23] a dire need and you're praying you want
[1:51:25] to see him right there on the scene but
[1:51:26] then he says i'm going over here to tend
[1:51:28] to this person first
[1:51:34] and lazarus is laying there
[1:51:37] and he he's getting worse and worse and
[1:51:39] worse by the day and jesus is saying i
[1:51:42] want to go back over here and his
[1:51:43] disciples are saying no no no lord we
[1:51:45] don't need to do that those people are
[1:51:47] wanting to stone you to death
[1:51:51] what about lazarus your friend what
[1:51:53] about our friend he sleepeth and and
[1:51:56] maybe we need to go see it and tend to
[1:51:57] him
[1:52:00] and the disciples look at the lord says
[1:52:03] if
[1:52:04] he shall do well
[1:52:06] the disciples are saying that to jesus
[1:52:07] if he's just asleep he'll be fine
[1:52:10] he's going to be all right if he's just
[1:52:11] sleeping and jesus just says no boys
[1:52:14] listen here
[1:52:15] let me speak plain to you
[1:52:17] lazarus
[1:52:18] is dead
[1:52:23] isn't it something hell
[1:52:26] nobody had to tell him that
[1:52:29] they sent word to him that he was sick
[1:52:31] but you never see in the scripture
[1:52:32] anywhere where the word was sent back
[1:52:34] and said it's too late he's gone
[1:52:37] but it says jesus spoke plainly to him i
[1:52:39] said listen guys lazarus is dead
[1:52:42] and he said i'm glad for your sake that
[1:52:44] i was not there
[1:52:48] because let me tell you what i'm going
[1:52:49] to do here for your sake and for the
[1:52:52] intent that you might believe
[1:52:54] i'm going to show you something you've
[1:52:55] never seen before in a roundabout way
[1:52:59] god is speaking to his disciples and
[1:53:00] telling them that and he says when jesus
[1:53:03] comes into the back into bethany he
[1:53:05] finds lazarus and he's been there in the
[1:53:07] grave for four days already
[1:53:12] the prophet said it said in his nose had
[1:53:14] sunk in skin worms were crawling out of
[1:53:16] him
[1:53:18] the stitch was probably
[1:53:21] at that time martha runs out when she
[1:53:23] sees jesus and she says lord
[1:53:25] if thou hast been here
[1:53:29] my brother would not have died
[1:53:32] i love the humility of martha here
[1:53:35] you know she could right there and said
[1:53:37] man we sent word to you
[1:53:40] we told you you had to come or he was
[1:53:43] going to die where have you been
[1:53:46] no
[1:53:47] see how she approached god
[1:53:50] with tenderness
[1:53:52] and concern and said lord
[1:53:55] if only you'd have been here
[1:53:58] lazarus would not have died
[1:54:01] and he says unto her
[1:54:06] jesus says my brother
[1:54:09] shall live again
[1:54:14] and what's martha say
[1:54:16] i know he'll he'll rise again in the
[1:54:18] resurrection
[1:54:21] martha
[1:54:22] who am i
[1:54:25] who am i
[1:54:28] i'm not four days late
[1:54:31] i'm right on time
[1:54:33] i am the resurrection and whatever i say
[1:54:37] will happen and whenever i say it it'll
[1:54:40] take place and that he that believeth in
[1:54:42] me as though he were dead he shall live
[1:54:44] again
[1:54:51] so this situation picture it now it's
[1:54:53] getting a little bit a little bit sticky
[1:54:56] jesus is explaining all this to martha
[1:55:01] and then all of a sudden mary hears
[1:55:03] about it and she comes out there and she
[1:55:05] comes out there and she wants to know
[1:55:06] the same thing if you would have just
[1:55:08] been jesus
[1:55:09] if you would have just been here and
[1:55:11] then mary breaks down and break
[1:55:14] down and cry
[1:55:16] and weep
[1:55:17] and moaning
[1:55:19] to jesus over the laws of lazarus
[1:55:26] and jesus wants to know where have you
[1:55:28] laid him
[1:55:32] and jesus begins to feel
[1:55:36] he begins to hurt
[1:55:39] jesus begins to have anguish
[1:55:42] and pain
[1:55:45] and it brings us to those two famous
[1:55:47] words
[1:55:48] jesus
[1:55:49] wept
[1:55:52] the prophet said when he wept
[1:55:54] he was weeping like a man
[1:55:58] it hurt like a man who had lost his best
[1:56:01] friend
[1:56:02] he hurt like a man who was watching the
[1:56:04] family grieve
[1:56:06] and moan oh and groan over the laws of
[1:56:08] their dear brother
[1:56:14] and jesus says was groaning in himself
[1:56:17] coming to the grave
[1:56:20] and he said
[1:56:21] take away the stone
[1:56:28] can you imagine
[1:56:30] the scenario the scene playing out
[1:56:32] before him martha mary said and martha
[1:56:34] begins to look and says
[1:56:36] jesus i don't know that this is a good
[1:56:38] idea he's he's been dead for four days
[1:56:40] he stinks let's don't let's don't
[1:56:42] embarrass our family like that and this

[1:57:30] the prophet began to tell the story
[1:57:31] about daniel
[1:57:34] he began to tell the story about daniel
[1:57:36] and he says i'll not defile myself to
[1:57:38] this king's world
[1:57:40] standing true to god he said he come
[1:57:42] right down to the end of the road it
[1:57:44] seemed like the end of his time had come

[1:57:47] what happened
[1:57:49] god's on the
[1:57:50] scene god stepped on the scene and one
[1:57:53] morning he said in babylon i love this
[1:57:56] story he said
[1:57:57] way down in babylon he said i can look
[1:57:59] up to heaven i can see a throne of
[1:58:01] angels standing around and he said i
[1:58:03] looked down here in babylon and i can
[1:58:06] see a burning furnace
[1:58:09] he said and i can see the children
[1:58:10] standing there saying
[1:58:12] oh god is able to deliver us
[1:58:17] and they can feel the heat bowling off
[1:58:19] of this furnace
[1:58:21] and these three boys these three hebrew
[1:58:22] boys are sitting in there and their only
[1:58:24] thought is i know that god is able to
[1:58:26] deliver us
[1:58:28] my god can be on time
[1:58:31] and he said we're not bowing to your
[1:58:33] image we're going to stand right here

[1:58:40] the guards they didn't they didn't try
[1:58:42] to go here and go there and make this
[1:58:44] right and make that no they stood the
[1:58:45] ground and said we're going to stand
[1:58:46] right here and we won't bow to your god
