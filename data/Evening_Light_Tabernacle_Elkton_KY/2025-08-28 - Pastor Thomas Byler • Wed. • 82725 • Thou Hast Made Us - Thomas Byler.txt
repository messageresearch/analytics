So me and my wife, Lord willing, plan on going Saturday morning maybe and go over there maybe taking a service or two over there also. Amen. So, Brother Jonathan Houch will be with you all Sunday morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, Amen. So anyway, we've been wanting to go over there for a long time and so it looks like it's going to work out for us this time by God's grace if nothing comes up between now and then. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God bless you. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Good to see everybody. Even Danny's doing things, you know. Hope you're all right, bro. Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. Everybody doing good? &gt;&gt; Oh, sounds good. All right. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we come before you. Father, thanking you, Lord, again, Father, to be able to assemble ourselves together in your name. So grateful, Lord Jesus, that you are with us, Lord Jesus. You'll never forsake us and you'll never leave us, Lord, even to the end of the age. Brother Abraham said, "That's the end of the world, Father. You'll never forsake your people." And we're so grateful for that. And we pray, Lord, that you'll just bless, Lord, the service this evening. Help me to get out of the way and that you might use my lips to speak the words that you once spoken, Father. And bless the ears of the hearer and the hearts of the hearers, Lord, they might receive what you have for us tonight, God. And we just pray, Lord Jesus, that you're that would you would be welcome, Lord Jesus. We want to invite you to come for we know that you always come to where you're invited, Father. And so we invite you to come and speak to our hearts tonight, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. If you will turn your Bibles. And I kind of wanted to uh kind of go on with our thought a little bit on giving honor and glory. That's due to his name. Amen. Is due to his name. Amen. And tonight we want to well, we just want to try to see what the Lord will have. But we want to talk about being worthy. Worthiness. Amen. Talk about worthiness. The title tonight is thou has made us. Thou has made us. Amen. And we'll look at what he what it is that he made us. Amen. We know he created us for one thing, right? We are the creation of God. Amen. But there's so many things that he's made us that we just have to go down the list, so to speak. Revelations, book of Revelations. Amen. In order for really for me to try to comprehend or get a grasp of this, I listen to the message. Amen. The breach. Amen. the breach between the seals and church ages. It was preached and I think that message would be in your seals book. Are we okay? Sound all right? All right. Good. Amen. And of course that is quite it's a wonderful sermon. Amen. Because he talks about Jesus Christ taking that book and that book of redemption. That book is a book of redemption. I mean, and it has he he mentions and I might might I might read a few of the quotes where he talks about it's the abstract title deed that went back to God after Adam forfeited it. Right? And nobody could touch it. Nobody was even worthy to look upon it. That right? But let's just read here in the fifth chapter of Revelations and we'll just read it and start somewhere and stop somewhere. Amen. So, we don't know just where to where we know where to start, but we don't know where to stop. Amen. Revelations 5 and verse one. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, to read the book, neither to look on it. And one of the elders said unto me, weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open a book, and to loose the seals thereof. Amen. down in verse uh nine. And they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof, for thou was slain, and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, tongue, and people, and nation, and has made us. Amen. Thou has made us. and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on earth. Amen. May God add his blessings through the reading of the word. You can be seated. Amen. Praise the Lord. Talk about worthy. talk about worthy and how that this lamb was worthy because why? Why was the lamb worthy to take it? Let me go back just for a minute. Brother Bannon, when he was preaching this, he goes into great emphasis talking about how that when this proclamation was made for somebody to take this book of redemption. Amen. And this is the this this is the book. Amen. That what he called the book of redemption. In other words, uh brother uh let me see brother Brandham said that John wept. Why? He said some ministers uh some minister had said that you know maybe John wept because he found himself not worthy. And brother Bam says no that's not even anywhere close. There's no question about us being worthy. Amen. And also the angel asked for let a man come forth. There was no man worthy. Isn't that right? But yet it had to be a man because in order uh redemption had to be you know it had to be the closest of kin. Isn't that right? In order to redeem something you had to be related to the person and he had to be the closest of kin and so forth you had to become kin folks. And I think brother Bam said he was the most sublime thought that there was because God changed where he was and who he was. Ain't that right? And he became man. Amen. He became one of us. Amen. He had to become kin folks to us. But there was nobody worthy. Not in heaven, not under the earth. Nowhere in all of creation was anybody found worthy to touch that book or to even look on that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it was the book of redemption. It had all of our names on it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because brother Bam said he knew out of the reason that John was weeping was because he knew that if nobody was felt worthy all of creation it was all lost you and I everything was lost if nobody's worthy to take that boat &gt;&gt; and to open the seals thereof. Amen. And if you'll notice Bam talks about how that after he was open you know after those seals open how did John begin to you know how did he rejoice? How did he worshiped? &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? Saying power and honor and glory, you know, to to to the one that sits upon the throne. Amen. Let me uh go all the way back here and just look at a quote here that I really like. Amen. He says, "Now the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world. He took the book glory and opened the book, tore off the seals and sent it down to earth. How many knows we could go way back and talking about brother Brandaman when he was thought he was going to die cuz the angel told him to go out west and so forth. Amen. And and and you know he told him to go out west and that something was going to happen and there was a big boom you know and he thought for sure he was going to pretty much telling his wife and kids I don't know if I'll be back. How many remembers that sus is is the time and and so they went out west and what happened was is that these angels in that right? Amen. Come down. Amen. And people were diving under trucks. Rocks were being cut out of the mountains. And I mean it was quite a quite a event that happened. Amen. And then God told Brother Bam, he says to go back to Jeffersonville because he was going to open up the seven seals and preach the seven seals. Isn't that right? Amen. So, just picking that up. Send it down to earth. Notice he sent it down to earth to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people. There you are. Oh my. He says, "And what happened?" He said, "The screams and the shouts and the hallelujah, the anointed, the power, the glory, amen, and the manifestation." Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe that there has been as a result of the opening of the seals. Amen. And every time you hear and know and even brother B talking about how that you can identify if your life identifies with this ear that shows you where your name is. &gt;&gt; Amen. We never understood that before. When did you ever hear out of denomination so forth that your name was put on that lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world? The lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. And if you're identified in that, it shows you who you are. If you truly believe that you're a son and daughter of God, boy, I'll tell you what, you got something to be excited about. &gt;&gt; Amen. 4:30 yesterday morning, I think it was, when some of this come to me. Amen. And I thought, you know, listen to the shouting, listen to the worship, listen to the praise. Amen. If John was a type after those seals were open, then how did he realize, hey, you know, this is the worthy. Well, he is worthy. All of creation. Amen. Cry. He is worthy. Thou art worthy. How many believe that's our our cry? Thou art worthy to receive glory and honor and power. Amen. He's worthy of everything he gets. Over in Revelations 19, I've read it many times before. He says his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns. Amen. Many crowns. In other words, how many knows that God has many titles? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's think about worthiness and let's think about titles. Now, he was the He was He was the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world. Amen. God has many titles. You have many titles. I have many titles. Amen. I wrote some of the titles down that just I have. First of all, I have the title of son. Is that right? How many knows that God has the title of son? He has the title of father. He has the son of the title of father, son, and holy ghost. In the name of the father, son god. When we talk about him, and we'll talk about him for a minute, but and we're trying to go somewhere. Amen. Because we want to show you, amen, something a little bit deeper here. But as a father son, I have the title of son. I have the title of father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows that if you wouldn't want to take the responsibility of a wife, well, I don't want to get married. I don't want responsibility. Well, then guess what? You don't never need to have no illitimate children either. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. You don't ever have no family either if you're not willing to take the responsibility of it. But you take the responsibility of a of having a wife, take responsibility of amen, having children and what comes with that. And that guess what? You're not going to get to go fishing and hunting near as much. &gt;&gt; Right, Willie. Hey, we had more time. We'd do more fishing. We do more hunting. We want to all of these things a little bit more. But what? Guess what? When you got children to raise, we got all these responsibilities. All games to go to. Whatever it is. Amen. But Troy and Robin, they know all about it. They got a quiver full. Go. They're They're right in the thick of it all. Whitty Michelle, they're in the thick of it all. Amen. But John W. Wade, they're in the thick of it all. That's right. Amen. Responsibility. And that automatic. And then you get the title of being a father. Not just a father, but a title of having been a husband. Ain't that right? a title of husband. Amen. It's a title. Amen. Amen. Me, I already got the title of grandpa. &gt;&gt; Grandfather. That's right. Amen. Man, Brother John, just a few years ago, we was looking at your kids and so forth and thinking, you know, they were just young yet kind of, man, it won't be long. And now, boom, it seems like we snapped our eyes and here you have a couple of grandchildren ready. goes fast, folks. Amen. Amen. Father, grandfather, pastor. Amen. Amen. How many of Jesus is the dearest friend that we could ever have? If you've got friends, then you have the title of being a friend. I'm a carpenter. I'm title of carpenter. I do masonary work. I can do masonary work. Lay block. That's right. Amen. So, I'm titled a builder. Whatever it might be, different things. That's all I can think of. Amen. old man. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Whatever you want to call me. I keep telling my wife, I said, "I'm an old geyzer." Now, I said, "What's an old geyzer?" We We tried to find out what an old geyser was. He said, "Somebody that's old and kind of setting their ways and you got some old ways of thinking about stuff and so forth." I said, "Yeah, that's about right." But anyway, that's just you. But what about God? &gt;&gt; I mean, he knows that uh you know what uh you know that God has a lot of titles. He has a lot of attributes. He's father. He became the son. He became the lamb. Amen. And in order to get titles, in order to have a title, most of the time you have to um well, let's just say let's just say um let's just use like the Stanley Cup. Is that right? There's cups, there's crowns, there's belts, there's all kinds of things. There's trophies. Isn't that right? All these different things that kind of give them uh g give them give them it gives them a title. In other words, uh in the boxing world, they have like a heavyweight title, a lightweight title, a featherweight title. Amen. Of who's the best boxer. Ain't that right? Before they can have that belt or whatever around them. Ain't that right? And boy, they're proud of that belt. &gt;&gt; Amen. When people get their cupton or whatever their trophy is, they run around there with the team. Yeah. Basketball, we're the best that there is. Football, we're the best. They have that that that little gold football, I guess. You know, I don't know that much about it, but you know, they have their trophy and boy, they're proud of that trophy. But what did they have to do? They had to earn it. &gt;&gt; How many believes like respect? How many knows that if people think that they are due some respect? Well, how many knows respect is earned? You earn respect. It's something that's earned it. That's the way it was with God. How many believes he earned it? That's why he's do it is because he've ear he's earned it. He's fought for it. He's done something for it. Why? How many believe that's why we respect God? That's why we honor God because of what he did for you and I. Because you are worthy because thou was slain. In other words, he did something. You went and you went to Calvary. You died to yourself in Garden of Gethsemane. You didn't want your will, but you wanted the father's will. And you suffered like no man has ever suffered. Heartbroke. All of humanity left him. His own disciples left him. Can you imagine his own disciples? Peter and John and all of them. Not one of them stayed there with him. They all fled. God all by himself having to face death by himself. Amen. And so because of what he done is why he's worthy of honor and glory and crown and the crown. Amen. Praise the Lord. Because of what he is. Amen. And we appreciate that. But no matter what the title is, you have to fight for it. Now, in today's world, they want to go through school and and and and get a you they want to pass even though they don't pass. &gt;&gt; They don't want to they don't want to study for it. Everybody wants equal rights. The women, they want to have get as much pay as the men. Isn't that right? Like old Trump says, "Well, let him do as much as man, and we'll pay him as much as man." Oh, that just irritates the fire out of me. You'll watch a YouTube of some woman trying to tackle a guy, some police woman trying to tackle a guy. Huh? Some of them get killed. It's a very stupid thing. Come on, people. Brother Bram says, "Man, they I have no business out there doing a thing." Amen. But what is what I'm I'm trying to say is how many believes that in order to in order to have a little victory, how many wants victory? &gt;&gt; Sure. Then you got to have a battle. Oh my. You can't have a victory without a battle. Amen. Let's look at God for a minute. Look at his titles. First of all, he's God. Why? He has he's he's earned the title of being God. One time he wasn't God. Why? Because he hadn't earned the title yet. There was nothing to worship him. God means object of worship. So what did he do? How many's glad that he spoke angels into existence? That's right. And they're there and they worship him because he was a creator. Amen. So he earned the title of being God. And in order to be a father, guess what? He had to have children, didn't he? You can't be a father unless you have children. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so became a father because he desired a family of his own. How many know every couple sitting here? Amen. Every family with children sitting here, you are a representation of what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world. He wanted to be that daddy that corrects his children, that teaches his children. Amen. The right way to go and that helps them to grow up when they get to be about 18, 19 years old. Amen. They act like their daddy. Amen. They act like their father. things that he taught him. Not rebellious and so forth. No, but to learn to teach him. That's what he is. Amen. We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son. Amen. We should act and think like God. Amen. It's amazing. I was sitting with my wife at somewhere. I think it was watching Emilyn play or something and and I just got to thinking of how much me and my wife think alike. Amen. Um, honey, did you get the eggs? Oh, yeah. I was just thinking about that a minute ago. Am I supposed to go get the eggs? Huh? Have the cows caught water? Oh, yeah. I was thinking we need to give the cows water, you know, or whatever it is. Oh, did you think about that? Or or or we'll be driving down the road in a certain thought and and then man, I was thinking that, too. After living together so long, you you you're in the same atmosphere. Ain't that right? And and you just kind of think on the same wavelength. I mean, believe that's the way it ought to be really. Amen. because you think of things and responsibilities and things that need to be done and your mind is there and so forth. And that's the way it ought to be with God and his wife. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That we ought to think the way he thinks. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But he was father. He has so many titles. What did he say? He had many crowns. In other words, he had many trophies. He's the victor. He's a mighty conqueror. He's the King of Kings. He's the Lord of Lords. He's the Alpha. He's the Omega. He's the beginning. He's the end. He's the rose of Sharon. And thank God, he's the lily of the valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like Sister Becky many times sings. Amen. He's a lily in my valley. When you're going through a Amen. a hard time in a low valley, guess what? He's the one, that little lily that sprouts up and give you a little joy. He's the light of the world. Amen. He's a mighty warrior. Mighty in battle. I mean, believes he's a warrior of all warriors. &gt;&gt; He's a soldier, brother Brian, of all soldiers. He's the undefeated, undisputed champion. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he is. And some of this championship, the way that he's a champion and what God is, he brings down. Amen. And he brings it down onto our level and brings us to be the same thing. &gt;&gt; Let's take a little turn right quick. Because all these things that God is, remember all that God is, we are. Isn't that right? We become all that God is. How many believes that God is a deliverer? He's a deliverer. And I really like the story because I want to I want to I want to look at this for a minute but that brother Brandham tells in the breach in the breach and I used it many times preaching and I really like it. I don't know if I can pull the quote up real quick maybe or not but we'll see if it's in here. Amen. All right. Here we are. He says, "Can you imagine someone falling from the earth down into a deep pit somewhere and was struggling and climbing and pulling They must by some means get out of this pit. I thought of it while I was laying on the bed. I thought about being in a pit with snakes, venomous snakes. Isn't that right? Rattlesnakes, cotton mouth, all kinds of snakes. And there you are. And you climb up a few rocks just to get out of their reach. But you're only going to be able to hold on so long. And your energy will run out run out. You'll drop down and you'll get bit by these snakes. Cuz how many knows this life is full of traps, full of deadly, poisonous things in this world, but there they are down in that pit and can't get out. Amen. That's what you That's where you and I were. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it means so much that fifth chapter of Revelation of how what he did, how he was our redeemer, how he was our savior, how he was our deliverer. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Climbing, trying to get out. They're not in their original state, frantically screaming. Isn't that what we'd be doing, buddy? We wear our vocal cords out. Help. Help. I'd be going as loud as I could. I'm a little quiet now. I don't want to hurt their ears, but I'd be whistling. I'd do whatever I had to to try to get that sound out there. Somebody get over here and give me some help. Woo! How many glad that somebody heard you? How many glad tonight that somebody heard your cry when you called out? Amen. There was somebody that heard it. Amen. Just like Barn Bland blind Barnabas, he was cried out, "Help me! Help me! Jesus! Jesus! Where are you?" God heard him. Jesus heard him when delivered him. That's the way we are as sinners. God, I don't know what church is right. I don't know. I'm a sinner. How do I get saved? Amen. I can't get out of this, Lord. But you've got to come and help me. Amen. I can't save myself. I can't get out of this. Amen. I don't care where you are. You can't get yourself out. God has to come down and get you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Screaming. They're clawing the walls, making a noise, or doing some way. They're groaning because they want to get back to their original state. Bible says that the whole creation is groaning. Isn't that right? Amen. And that's why a person that's struck with disease aches and pains. Amen. One time they wasn't that way, but they're groaning. They're not where they're supposed to be. Something's wrong. Amen. That's right. They're not right. There's something wrong. And they're groaning trying to get back to where they were when they were healthy. Amen. And when nature and the peoples and Bible said they're groaning, it shows that there is something. Amen. Not in their ought to be conditioned. They have fallen from somewhere. Amen. And they don't need anybody to interpret that for us. That's right. Cuz we know that what it was that we fell from was eternal life. Brother Van talks about that abstract title needed was that abstract title needed to eternal life went back to the father. Nobody could take of it. But praise be to God because of Calvary. I'm here to tell you that I'll never Oh boy. I didn't say this a while ago. Amen. But brother Brandham, another thing I thought is that Brother Brandham, he said when he went uh when he he's over yonder. He said that in this in the breach. Amen. And I'm way down there in the holler somewhere. You hear me singing Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound. He says, "Oh, brother Benham made it. Oh, brother Benham made it." Ain't that right? Listen. And I thought, you know, because this praise that we have, this thankfulness that we have in our hearts, it's not just for a week or two, a month or two, a year or two. Amen. It's for all eternity. I'll I'll read I'll read the rest of this quote here after a bit. But the in the eternal ages as they roll on, the redeeming lamb of Christ will still be known amongst his people. When the oceans have wept themselves into the desert and sin is heaped so high till it shook the moon out of its socket, the love of God shall still endure. And the Christ that lives tonight will be the same Jesus who he is when he sits on the throne. Oh glory all eternity he will be the same. How many believe that we get to do this for all of eternity? Brother John says we get to do this forever. Aren't you glad that we get to worship him forever? We'll always down through the ceaseless ages of eternity. We'll praise the lamb that was slain. We'll say that he is worthy of honor and power and glory. He is worthy for the yays and the huras and the screams and the sh. He's worthy 10,000 years and we'll just be started. We'll have no dead last days to sing God's praise than when we first begun. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes it's time to start praising the Lord? &gt;&gt; It's time to thank God. Amen. and be a worshshiper of him because he's worthy. Realizing that it's always hinged on Calvary, understanding, Brother Bam said, the whole mystery of God is made known in those seals. I mean, as you and I understand the whole mystery of God, his whole plan of God, I mean, he took his plum back. back. I mean, brother Bam took his plumb back to the very thoughts of God. The back part, he called it, the very back part of God's mind. What he had in his mind when there was no angel, no stardust, no nothing. That way back there, he was thinking some things and I was in his mind when the song says when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. But I want you to understand, I was in his mind long before the cross. Amen. When the cross was in his mind before the foundation, I was there. If you're redeemed tonight, remember brother Ram says we are now redeemed. He just hasn't come and made the possession. Amen. Claim the possession. Claim that redemption possession yet. But we're now redeemed back to God. Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. Now, let's just turn this thing a little bit. We could go on and on. Amen. It's hard to stop. &gt;&gt; How many believes he is the champion? He is I am the Lord the healer. &gt;&gt; He is our healer. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I didn't have to stay home tonight cuz I was sick. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, are you glad you're over that co? &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord. You feel better, right? Hallelujah. Why? Because he is your healer. He's our savior. He's our deliverer to bring us up out of that pit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me come down here to you a minute. What if you was in that pit? What if you was in that pit? You couldn't get out. You was in there for days. You couldn't Oh, boy. You would You're so thirsty. You're You're passing out literally. Sometimes you just fall almost. Let's take the snakes out. I don't want you falling into the snakes, but you just pass out and you lay on the bottom of that pit. You wake up. I just can't barely get any water. I got to have water. I got to have water. Help me. Somebody help me. He says, "I don't have any strength to yell anymore. Your voice is getting smaller and smaller and smaller." Hello. And all of a sudden, next time you pass out again, next time you look up there, there I am standing over. Hey, are you all right? Are you all right? Help me. It mean &gt;&gt; I said, I seen you down there and I went to hardware up there and I got a rope. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Here's a rope. And you throw that rope down. Huh? I don't know. Maybe you're so weak. I'll have to put you on my back and get you out. Huh? But I get you up out of there. I give you a big old cold glass of water. Here's some water. Here's some baloney. Maybe we'll have a t-bone or something. Let's go bigger better than baloney. Huh? and I give you some drink, what would you do? &gt;&gt; How do you think you would react to me? &gt;&gt; Huh? I tell you what, I wouldn't worship you, Brother Glenn, but I'd probably want to kiss your feet. Let me just Them feet's precious, man. I'm so glad them feet come here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You say, "Man, you're the greatest man in the world. &gt;&gt; You're so awesome. Man, you'd be so honored. You'd be so glory. You'd be so Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Shut up. No. Thank you. I'm going to thank you some more. I am thankful that you got me out of here. How many know give thanks unto the Lord? Give thanks unto the Lord cuz he's worthy of thanks and praise. Cuz that's what he did to you and I. We were in that pit. We couldn't get out. We couldn't quit sinning. We couldn't overcome death. We couldn't overcome that. But he come out there and he helped you to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows in the Old Testament, don't have the thing here, but if you come into the presence of God into the Holies of Holies, what would happen? Only Aaron could go there once a year and he had to be done everything just right. Everything had to be just right for you to come there. But not that the cross has happened. Now that Jesus has that cross, how many knows that that veil was put there? Amen. To keep the people out. When Jesus died, what happened to the veil? It ripped. Amen. Said, "Come on." Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden." Why? Because now that your sins are paid for, he makes you worthy. &gt;&gt; God makes you worthy to come into his presence. &gt;&gt; We don't feel worthy a lot of times in ourselves. There's a lot of things we're unworthy about. But one thing we are worthy is because of the blood of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you tonight become worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us, Paul said, let us come boldly before the throne of grace. Ain't that right? Why? We can come boldly. Man, you better not come disrespectful and this that or the other in the Old Testament, but now have some boldness. Come ask a petition. Ask God for forgiveness. Ask God to fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's talk about that for a minute. Talk about our worthiness. Now, we're only worthy because he makes us worthy. in Sardis chapter 3 of Revelations and verse4 thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white. How many knows in Revelations 19 there it talks about that they were given to have white robes. They're dressed in the white raignment clean and white the righteousness of saints here. These are going to walk in white for they are worthy. I might tell you you're worthy. Somebody else might tell you worthy and you may not be worthy. But when God tells you that you're worthy, you're worthy. How the devil will tell people that you're not worthy to be saved. If you're not worthy for forgiveness, you're not worthy because you've messed up too many times. &gt;&gt; Let me just give you a real good uh uh what did I want to call it? Some really good advice, some good counseling. When the devil tells you that you've messed up too much, that you're not worthy of forgiveness, you just take back to the scripture where God said that we're to forgive each other 4 times a day. And if that's us, how much more God is willing to forgive you if you're willing to forget for for repent. &gt;&gt; So don't take that off of the devil. Don't listen to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not worthy. Don't you say that. That's the devil's language. God says you are worthy. Why? Because when he went to the cross, he made everybody worthy. Cuz he would have never said whosoever will let him come if he hadn't got the blood there to make you worthy. Amen. Here the these people were worthy. Amen. Praise the Lord. And you know it, let me just read you a couple things here. Chapter one of Revelations verse 5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, the prince of the kings of the earth. Amen. Now, I always thought that was the kings that are out there now. those who rule. I'm sure that he's he he he's got his they're like a drop a bucket. He raises up who he wants to and puts in where he wants to. How many of the Bible does say that? But after looking at this other scripture, all I can tell you is I'm not so sure that he was talking about them anymore. Amen. He says, "The prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests." &gt;&gt; Amen. Kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Now notice chapter five after he talked about they sang a new song. thou worthy to take the book because thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, tongue, and people and nation, and has made us unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign on earth. How many know better teaching in a church age book says, "We are now kings. We are now reigning. We're reigning over the flesh. We're reigning over the world. We're reigning over sin." Sure, we're now kings. We're rulers. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; So are these in because in the spiritual kingdom, we're ruling over devils. They have to obey us. They're under our feet. Not saying we aren't going to be there in a millennium and ruling, you know, for a thousand real. We will. The Bible says we'll rule and reign with him for a thousand years. But he's made us. How many knows that it's about what God makes you? &gt;&gt; Let me bring in this thought now. God said that, you know, we know that God is the master. He is truly the deliverer. Ain't that right? But when he told Moses, Moses, I've come down to deliver my people, but I'm sending you. Amen. That deliverance come down into Moses's hand to deliver. Just like imparting eternal life. How many knows the bride is supposed to impart eternal life? But bam, one place said that is the greater works is to actually impart eternal life to other people to go out there and preach the gospel and bring people eternal life to them. The wife is having children so to speak. Is that right? Imparting eternal life. And so guess what? This great deliverer, they could have said Moses deliverer. They could have said David was a deliverer. And they were, but it was God in them that was doing delivering. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. How many know that Jesus went to hell, death, and the grave and conquered it? He was vic victorious over all of that. He overcame all of that. But yet he says, "To him that overcomemeth will I grant to seat with me in my throne, even as I overcame." How many believe that that same overcoming power is now in you, it's now in me? One place, brother Bam said that we are his victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you are when you are overcome sin, when you overcome unbelief and doubt, you are God's victory. &gt;&gt; Living through me and living through you. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing it is. How beautiful it is. How many knows that God is joy? God is peace. God is patience. God is meekness. And all of that is right in you. If God is in there, remember she is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he overcome that. And Paul said that we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. How many believes you're a conqueror? &gt;&gt; Oh, we talk about Napoleon. Brother Bam said in victory, Napoleon overcome the whole world. until water low. Isn't that right? He was sad because he didn't have nothing else to overcome at 33. But he says how much greater it was when Jesus at 33 overcome death, hell, and the grave. I mean, how many believes that was an eternal victory? He talked about Germany's victory. He talked about these others victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have been made victorious. I made legs. That's what we've been made. Thou hast made us. You have made us victorious. You have made us like yourself. &gt;&gt; It's what God has made us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for what God made you? &gt;&gt; It's what he does in your life that matters. I wanted to pull it up and I didn't know which words to really find to try to pull it up, but you'll maybe remember it where brother talked about this one man and I'm thinking it was I don't know if it was a fiddle or or just what it was that this man played but he was really really good and he went into this great auditorium. Ain't that right? Thousands upon thousands of people came to hear him. Isn't that right? And there he was just a playing and just everybody was in awe. And at the end of it, for some reason, this boy kept looking up in the balcony. Kept looking up in the balcony and kept looking up in the balcony. And at the end of it, they all stood up and roared. And he was just quiet and looked at his master. And the master nodded. &gt;&gt; That's what he was looking for. &gt;&gt; Did he make the master happy? Amen. Amen. God gives you the victory shouting. But guess what? It's not something that you take glory on yourself that you're worthy, but it's him that made you. &gt;&gt; He We look to him say, "God, is this pleasing to you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'll tell you what, when people try to take honor and glory to themselves, God is not very pleased with that. We have nothing to boast about. Amen. Except our boast is in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that we are, all that I am here, all that you are tonight is because of what God has m made you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with a story. Is that all right? Amen. Remember, God specializes. God specializes in taking things that's nothing and making something out of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he'll take things that are something and make nothing out of them. You know, some of these movie stars, you hear them committing suicide, dying in their house, no friends, all kinds of money in the world, but they die really sad. Some of them do. I hope I never die like that. I want to die with a smile on my face &gt;&gt; if I die. Let's just not plan on dying about it. But if I was to, smile on my face, my family and friends, and comfort and peace in my heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then let's look at what God made the man David, the least in his family, the littlest guy, little scrawy little fella. Ain't that right? But he had something that was of great value that God saw in here. How many believe that's what's important? &gt;&gt; Just what's in here? &gt;&gt; What's on the inside? And I think it was David that wanted to build the house. That right? God says, "No, you can't." This is where I think I'm going to try to pick up my story. showing the consecration of David to the love of God and then to see the same night how knowing that he was in error that he was not permitted to do it. God was graceful enough to come down to speak to Nathan. And I always like those words. Go tell David, Nathan, my servant, that I took him from the sheep's coat. He wasn't nothing. Amen. Nothing. Down in a hole. I believe he said that about Israel. I found you in a wilderness bleeding and so forth. Ain't that right? So to speak, how many knows that's where we were when God found us? &gt;&gt; Nothing. People that are ready to jump off a bridge, put a gun to their head, that's a good place for God to begin to deal with them. They come to the end of their yourself. I can't run this thing. I haven't, you know, I'm a complete failure in running this thing. Amen. Then give their heart to God. I had to go. I came to that place, Pinecraft, Sarasota. Lord, and I wasn't about to put a gun to my head. No, I wouldn't commit suicide. But I had come to the place, Lord Jesus, I don't care what it is. I give you my heart, my life, my everything. Lord, how many believes that's the kind of sacrifice God's looking for? You wasn't nothing. Amen. And what did he say? And I've given you a name like the great men of the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham. Noah. How many Abrahams? We don't have a lot of people calling their children Abraham anymore. Got a few Noah. Peter. Isn't that right? Andrew. Few Thomases. John's. Bunch of John's. Huh. Those men, they were great men. Ain't that right? And we name our children after those disciples and so forth. Great men. But God said, "David, I've made you a great name. Took you from the sheep coat. Look what I've done." Amen. Brother Bam says, "And I'd like that to apply that for just a minute. I took you from nothing and I gave you a name. You've got a name like the great men of the earth." No, I'd like to play that in a confidential a way of making a point and he was talking about himself. I was thinking a few years ago I was standing down here in the city and nobody cared for me. Nobody loved me. I loved people but nobody loved me because of the background of my family. No disregard to my mama my my mom and my father. How I wish mama could have lived to see this sanctuary this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know about you, but I think the tabernacle is pretty humble. &gt;&gt; I'd say this place is a lot nicer than that. &gt;&gt; Huh? But yet, at the time, Brother Brandham treasured it. You know why? Because when he was younger, that place was a pond and he would be skating on it and people would be making fun of him and make, you know, from school and everything, they made fun of him. He was the offcar. He said, and I don't know if he'll say it or not, but anyway, because of what God had did, I don't care what it is, if it's humble looking or not, it's it's a great thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. He loved people. He go there and let me see. What did I miss? Oh, I wish mama could come down and see this sanctuary this morning. Many of the old times who placed their money to help build it. Maybe God let him look over the banister. And I've got a few different quotes because I was trying to get couple of different stories. Sometimes he mentioned the story, sometimes he didn't. But the Brandon family didn't have a very good name around on the count of drinking. Nobody had nothing to do with me. I remember telling my wife not long ago, I couldn't get anybody to talk to me. Nobody cared about me. Amen. Now I have to hide to get a little rest. He had no friends. When he got downtown, what they do? They talk to him talk a little bit, but as soon as anybody else would come, they would, he said they would go talking to him and just ignore him completely. He didn't even there anymore. Huh? Or they wouldn't even acknowledge him. Amen. Now the Lord has given us great place in these great things that he has done. Amen. And given me besides a bad name, he gave me a name liken unto great men. And he's cut off my enemies wherever I have went. Amen. How many thankful you're sitting here? That means God probably cut your enemies off. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; The same application that Brother Brandham, I want to try to bring that into this atmosphere here this this evening. How many believes that we were nothing when God found us? &gt;&gt; We're still nothing but by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How did I ever know as a little ragged kid up here two, three blocks from here from Ingville School when I was la the laughingtock of the school being so ragged and skate on an old pond. How did I ever know that down beneath that pond laid a seed of a lily that could bloom like this? And how did I ever know that? No one talking to me. And yet he gave me a name that would be honored amongst his people. &gt;&gt; How many believes William Brandham? That's an honored name. &gt;&gt; That's an honored name. That's exactly right. I pity people that dishonor it, that cringe or hate when you mention Brother Brandham. I hate where you're going to spend eternity cuz when he comes with millions and millions of the converts, hello. Where is those people going to be? All that you ever loved and that loved you will be there. Not those that hate you &gt;&gt; and dislike you. Oh boy. I hope somebody out there hears this that didn't like him. You You're in a great danger. I I'd hate to be where you were. I'm scared for you. I'm worried for your soul because you're dead wrong and will be eternally wrong. &gt;&gt; Repent if you can. All right. And as a little old kid sitting there, even no shirt on, my coat pinned like this with a safety pin, real hot. Teacher said, "William, aren't you a little hot with that coat on?" "No, ma'am, just a little bit chilly." And she made me go over to the stove and put some wood in there. And I liked burned up. I didn't have no shirt the whole season through. no shirt a whole season through. And I thought if I could ever get money sometime, I'd get a little old 3030 rifle and I'd come out west and live out here and hunt the rest of my life. I don't want nothing to do with people. Just stay away. They don't love me. But because they didn't like me, not just stay away from them. Amen. Then he goes talk about every time I go downtown, they talk to me until somebody else come along. But now I said to my wife not long ago, my wall is plastered with the best guns that can be bought. Oh, and I think of the old dirty clothes. Tonight I got two or three good suits. And no, friends, I have to hide in the wilderness just to keep away from people. What's the matter? Is it my personality? Is it because of education? No. It was God rich in mercy. Everybody think of where the Lord has brought you from where you are today. And remember, it's not your personality. It's not what you did. It's what the grace of God was to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." Thank you, Lord. [Applause] It was not my education. No. God rich in his mercy saw me in that condition and he saved me. Amen. All that I am, all that I could ever hope to be. I have derived from the grace and mercy. I was wretched, miserable, poor, and blind. But by grace, he healed me. I am strong and healthy by the grace of God. I have good eyesight. I have eat. I have drink. And whatever I have need of, he never s promised to supply my wants, but my needs. How many we would say, I have derived from his grace. Stand with me. I have derived from his grace. We are what we are this evening. This church is the grace of God. &gt;&gt; This congregation is the grace of God. You're looking at the grace of God. What the grace of God can do. I'm looking at what the grace can do, the mercy of God, the goodness of God, what he did for us on Calvary. How many appreciates what he did for us on Calvary? Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen. God bless you richly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Bless him back. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Something about his heart, maybe. Okay. Well, let's pray that they'll find what it is, right? Find what it is. Amen. Yes. Yes. Thank you. That was about Aaron right there. Amen. Let's pray. Each and every one of us, let's ask God to touch his soul. Get him back in fellowship with him and for his body. Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight, Lord, with our brother Aaron. Lord, we watched that boy grow up from a little child. Lord Jesus, we claim him as one of yours, Lord. And we ask, God, that you would take, Father, your Holy Spirit and go to where he is now. Lord, bring conviction upon his heart. Bring conviction upon his soul. Father, he needs to be picked up out of this big hole, this pit that he's in. Lord, Father, we know that only you can do it, but we've got a whole band of believers asking and praying for him, saying, "Lord Jesus, touch him, Lord Jesus. We can't pick him up. We can't do it, Lord. Many of us have tried, Lord. Did everything we know what to do, Lord. We ask God that your mercy and your grace, Lord Jesus, would be extended to Aaron, Lord, and that he would also understand. Amen. And know what it is to be redeemed and what it is to have the grace of God change your whole being. Lord, we don't know just why he's so young and why he would have these problems, Lord, but we know that you know all about it. We ask God that it would be working for your honor and for your glory and for his embedment Lord. We do ask for mercy for him Lord Jesus and for his body. But most of all we care about his soul Lord Jesus that he would be right with you father. So we ask God have your divine grace father go and meet him father in that hospital just now. Father be merciful Lord Jesus as you have been to us father. We ask for mercy for him in Jesus name. Amen and amen. God bless you. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy.
