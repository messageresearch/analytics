evening good to be in the house oh Lord good to see everybody here tonight amen this wonderful rainy rainy day amen well now that we're done with all of our secondary work let's do what we do best amen right we'll do what we do first amen that's worship God I mean I believe that that's serve God Amen come to the house of God this is what we this is our number one job amen everything else is second good to see brother Ryan sister send that back amen hope you all just feel so much better amen praise the Lord amen God bless you good to see our company at amen Lord bless y'all hey man good to see y'all hey man and it's just good to be in the house of the Lord amen um so I picked up a thought that I basically kind of ended with a couple weeks ago and I want to pick it up from there amen and expound perhaps uh in a little bit different direction if I can with the hip of the Lord and I believe I spoke on uh bride food and I got to talking about amen how that uh I believe at the end of it I was talking about perfect strength by Perfect weakness amen and how that we come down to dust amen amen like Paul did he was struck down on the road to Damascus I believe it was amen and he was struck down to the dirt so to speak amen and so I mean we want to pick up from there and then perhaps him come up from the dust would that be okay come up from the dust and see what God can do amen amen what did I title this tonight I'm not even sure I believe it's when God takes over amen when God takes over amen let's pray Lord Jesus we come before you once again Lord with grateful hearts to have a group of people Lord Jesus here in this Elkin area Lord that loves you and that wants to serve you with all their heart father and that's looking forward to seeing you soon face to face Lord and that comes out on a Wednesday night Lord to prepare their self for that great day that lays ahead Lord Jesus and father we ask God who is streaming tonight that you'd be with them also Lord and Lord mold and shape them Father as your word Goes Forth father we know the hearing of the word it shapes us it molds his father and Lord we just ask God that you come and mold us and shape us into your image have your perfect weight tonight Lord Jesus as we surrender ourselves to you may you use us for your honor For Your Glory now bless the thoughts of our heart and bless your word in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord so amen I just uh I mean it's certainly gonna sound like a perhaps a repeat of what we've said here a few weeks ago go but Eamon I got to thinking about this and it's just because the Lord's just began to pour it out it seemed like so we just try to follow the leading of the spirit amen and see what he would have amen amen if you will turn your Bibles and I think we'll start with um First Corinthians the second chapter First Corinthians 2 and I'm gonna for the few minutes we want to cover some of the quotes and things amen that we've read before before we get into the middle part of our thought and the men and then we'll just go from there amen First Corinthians 2 and verse 1. and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in Meek in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech was not the preaching and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit of God that you face should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God may God that is blessings to the reading in the word amen you can be seated amen I want to emphasize to begin with what Paul says in verse 3 when he says and I was with you in weakness amen remember the little quote we read brother bam says what we need is a bunch of weaklings amen we need some weaklings amen now notice here Paul you know most of us preachers probably today we'd say something you know boy I'll tell you what we had a service to you the other day and man it was just such a powerful service and all of this you know here Paul comes and now he comes and talks about how weak he was and how did he add fear you're always talking about not having a nephew yet fear amen and his he has has he come in much trembling wouldn't it be something if we could have Paul stand up here amen and speak those words I'd love to just see his demeanor and the spirit that goes along with it and just the way that he brought it about it's probably different than what we think isn't that right but that's what he was and I you know that word fear I like what the the brother banham you know it takes a profit of God a lot of time to bring these things out amen and and he explained he explained what this fear was amen he says now the reason that he was fearing is not because he was scared of anything but he was scared that he would displease God in some way in some way amen that he'd get his own ability mixed up into it amen now we're beginning to begin with our thought tonight and that is about our human ability amen Paul amen and I I just want to say this tonight because I hear preachers everywhere all the time we're talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ with a manifestation of the hour and all these things and I truly believe that I believe we are the bride of Christ but amen what I want to talk about is what that bride is amen what she really is because guess what you're you're not just going to be anything and be the bride you're going to have to have some qualities there's some things going to be about you that makes you the bride amen amen and it's going to be what's on the inside is what's going to meet God and I truly believe that uh this this we are the word of God Amen how many believes that and we are becoming the word of God we're becoming the message of the hour how many believe that and tonight's service is certainly going to be more bride food amen it's things that we eat even because you become what you eat amen and so now those here he says he was scared that he would displease God in some way and I had to think Maya Paul was that way shouldn't every Christian be the same way shouldn't we worry a little bit sometimes that we do something in ourselves that would be displeasing God because sometimes we might get our own way mixed step into it because I'm telling you amen when we get our own ways mixed up into it we bitterly fail amen amen oh my that's right praise the Lord so now notice here he says oh now notice listen to this man who was a warrior had stripped himself amen if there's anything that our schools needs today churches needs today is a stripping of ourselves amen of our own thoughts and our own abilities Faith the Lord strip yourself before God unless you would try to do something within yourself amen let me tell you the strongest most powerful person man or woman in here is a person that has not necessarily because you've cast out devils and moved mountains and all those things but a person that actually whipped themselves conquered yourself that's your biggest enemy that's the hardest thing to do is to conquer yourself and I truly believe if I can add the ability somehow I could show us all that there's still too much of our self there that we still have a lot of room to improve when it comes to dying to ourself I truly believe that amen all right a couple of quotes like I said before we go on become nothing second Corinthians 12. in verse 9 amen verse 11 go with verse 8. for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect and weakness amen it sounds like Paul hit the bullseye it sounds like Paul is where he was supposed to be and that is weak in himself oh my amen come in weakness my strength I Faith be to God oh my I like that because if you want more of God's perfect strength you've got to become weaker most gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me now here we can preach for a whole sermon on just the infirmities that God sends you away the trials that he sends you away Amen to cause you to realize that you're weak that you can't do it oh my there's a testimony amen I wrote over here if there's a testimony that I know that I have had in my life is that when God brings me to the place that I can't do anything about it I can't get over it I can't get around it I can't get under it then I squirm like a worm you do too it's a terrible place I mean come on folks man you ain't got the money to pay the bills or this happens or that happens and then out of your power I like container within my power to do something about it but God brings you the place where it's with outside of your power and the more you try to do it in yourself the more you fail and the more you fail oh it's just a terrible place to be until finally you get smart and you drop to your knees and realize you know that's where God wanted you in the first place to where you would not try to do it in yourself but you'd learn to rely on God praise the Lord Amen brother Sean sometimes it takes people 40 years to learn new things 40 years I I I dare say there's some people claim to be message people and they haven't learned it yet they still ain't learning and I highly question whether they ever will amen because you've got to recognize the moving of God in your life let me just say this that if you bitterly fail at something you need to go back and see check your motive and your objective you see if you had any of your own ability in there at all because and I'll read you the quote but the Bible says God don't never fail God don't fail and I grant you he said any of your abilities you will fail if you're in it at all you will fail oh my you can look at yourself and see where you failed you can look at others and see where they failed and they failed they failed and it says I'm like don't you realize that God ain't in what you're doing you need to go a different direction amen praise the Lord that's right now let me get to my point here therefore therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproach Us in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's Lake for a winner break for when I am weak then am I strong I'm gonna rephrase that just a little bit that'd be all right for when I am reading is he strong amen just like Paul said the faith that I have I have it's not my faith but it's the very faith of the Son of God the life that I not live I live by the face of the son of God then am I strong and I have become a fool and Glory oh my if you all haven't done any studying Paul in this glory and he says he many places he talked about I'm gonna brag about all the bad stuff that happens to me I'm gonna glory in my eternity and I'm gonna Post in life if I have anything to boast about it whatever it's about my infirmity the things that God allows to come my way man I can't even escape a shipwreck amen I Get Shipwrecked two or three times he got into my doctor when Paul got into the boat you better give your ticket back and get done another move why because he was going down [Applause] Hallelujah but the good thing about is God said don't tell anybody to jump overboard try to escape to stay where you are it'll be all right I'll calm this ocean down hey man how about this Peter and what about that little ship though we may not give you get anywhere where Jesus is and one of God's servants and you're in for a Target amen I tell you what it's like the bullseye on you and every arrow out of hell is going to be pouring the starch and the arrows are gonna fly don't get too close to the real thing unless you're ready to have something like adversity [Music] but Jesus always came through didn't he now on the back here we are on the island and we finally got this nice little campfire going and man we're having some good separate and a snake jumps out of the fire and bites under is what else can go wrong huh praise be to God but when you told me I'll tell you what it's God that delivers me it's God that should shook it up and kept on going it's all for his glory it's all for God praise be to God oh my God all right let me go down to the bottom of that verse I'm a fooling Glory you have compelled me for I ought to have been recommended of you amen for in nothing am I behind the chiefest apostles though I be nothing amen praise the Lord how many believes you got to come to the place to where you realize you're nothing amen now notice what he says here he says the person that ought to thought that he was was not insufficient the person that had no ability then that person such in good shape so God can start using them that's right when they feel like they can't and haven't got nothing that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we are thinking that we're able to do it and God can't use us because we're wanting to do it in ourselves when we are insufficient in ourselves then we are subjects to yield to God's spirit amen oh my so then if it's us trying to do it it will fail amen I wrote down here man last time you failed at something did something wrong said something to somebody you shouldn't have said it or did something or whatever it was and it was bitterly just went bad you have to ask yourself was that me huh was that my ability in there amen oh my I don't know about you yes Lord I know what you're talking about that I got a rebound in here yeah these preachings coming back at me [Laughter] tell her right can I preach it was oh my that's right but boy I'll tell you what my mind okay now notice but as long as we're trying to now notice but if we'll just yield it'll fail but if we'll just yield ourselves to God then God can't fail there's only one thing that God cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail amen no notice I need to read this over here first 67 62. 63 it is it is before now first let me just um get something to you read this quote no ability I don't care whose it is will never be usable in the sight of God God has to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose amen now look around today and all of our great achievements that we think we've done and where is Christianity in the United States remember this around 1963. look at where it's at in the United States look at all of our churches and our denominations look at our evangelists and healing campaigns and everything else that we've had and what is it worse then it was at the beginning folks I don't know how they could have said it back then but if you look at it today you apply this scripture today you can exactly see what brother Brandon's talking about where are they all at what was all the Billy Graham and all of them where's all the healing Billy Graham it all over the place what what is become of the world talking to a man up there and the grocery store at The Food Giant we're a Methodist Church a man pulled away from the main organization the Methodist because they're allowing homosexuals and lesbians and everything else and so they wanted him to become Pastor perhaps a Pentecostal huh he's telling me man they ain't got no clothes don't dress right and everything else they got all kinds of man they're so far off the beaten path they're just pulling away because of homosexual lesbians and so forth but they're pathetics eight balls huh that's the condition of the church world it's in real bad shape Prophet God was exactly right wasn't he look at it today oh my look at everything he says where's the name boss at the beginning it's worse off today than it ever was because that we've tried it to do it in human ability oh my even talking about their prayers and everything else so what I gather from this brothers and sisters is that you and I are going to have to have something more something different than they did all that was preached all that was done you're gonna have have something more amen otherwise we're just going to end up like them a complete failure why do Christians fail because they haven't come the right way I may believe there's a right way and a wrong way you've got to come God's way amen praise the Lord aren't you glad oh my I'm so thankful for this message aren't you so glad for this message you got sent because infant food wasn't for that what would we do amen again the quote I wanted to read now what good did it do nothing and it'll never be until every person that professes to be a Christian will forget about your own ability and yield himself to God you won't say that nothing unless you are dead you you're so yourself the almighty God we need a surrender to God like never before because you and I would let me tease them oh my we've got so much so much of ourselves still a lot of times we still have everything else first we've got too many things up first God has to be first when you go home and when you make a deal or this out of the other well I'm a Christian first somebody asked you well what do you do what do you do I serve God that's my master that's my first thing is I am God's serving I'm a Christian that's what I do now if you want to know my secondary job or my second thing I do I might be a carpenter I might be a logger I might be a uh you know a metal man whatever it might be that's all second everything you did this week was your secondary work we're here this is what we do first foreign doesn't matter when I go out my door tomorrow morning amen this I'm a Christian first and then I go do something that I need to do no matter what I do it's always Christ in it all but every all of our working all our money making and all of that stuff's all secondary amen it all has to be yielded completely to God amen we think today sometimes that the Great Men of God you know are people perhaps that have achieved a lot in their wealthy and they're well off and all of that I want you to know the most greatest powerful of Warriors of all and men were pretty much bums they like I wrote down here during the bomb category when it comes to material things you're in the bum didn't even Jesus say foxes have holes Purge of nests but I ain't got no bed I ain't got nowhere to lay my head huh Paul he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ spent a lot of time in jail and in bonds and imprisonments and a lot of times he'd asked Timothy somebody just bring me a coat huh that much why but I'll tell you what we make sure we're all taken care of what about this guys he well taken care of the Inner Man amen praise the Lord praise the Lord all right praise the Lord so let me see that's right never did any good until every person that professors Christian will forget his own ability yield himself to God you know how many people wouldn't follow the message today I wouldn't pay attention to that Pillar of Fire right there you know and all these things that either the discernment of things is because they were had a position in the church you know why that Pentecostal that brother Brandon got on the phone with and said now we're gonna have to take him the name off the book because he came in fellowship with you he was up on this age and so forth and he he fellowshipped with you no doubt but Jesus Christ came and discerned the thoughts into the heart and the meeting and everything and the Pentecostal said we're gonna have to take his name off the book huh do you reckon he had some of his own abilities in there his own selfish motives in there that's exactly what it was why do you think the Pharisees they had a selfish motive didn't they they had a selfish motive and let me tell you something Paul he had a selfish mode he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees his ability what he could do oh my how many notes it's not about what you can do the Antichrist will actually force force people Amen to worship him God Don't Force us to worship Him you won't be able to buy or sell unless you belong to him and the devil forces people through political and financial means and anytime somebody's not born again let me tell you something if you're not born again you will lead to your own ability you'll try to get things done according to the way that you can get it done naturally instead of relying on God to do it huh maybe maybe it's a white my wife isn't the way she wanted to be amen and so I'll tell you what just like that Pentecostal BPM the mother band he says I've been praying for my wife I've been trying to cast the devil off of her getting her to be a Christian and everything else isn't that right brother bam says you're going about it all wrong go buy her some flowers and some gifts and be nice to her hey man what did he wins it was nice Jordan and showed her love and it revolutionized his world his ability or God's ability the right way or the wrong way amen oh Lord help us folks if we expect to be in a Rapture one of these days there's a lot of message people no doubt they won't go another message people ain't going there's a lot but a man says there's going to be a very very very few come out of this generation if you're going to run this race and you've planned on being there God is going to do work in your life you've got to do a work in your heart he's going to change you and what's it going to do it's going to come the way that this Prophet the message is for brought according to what Paul said that you've got to die to yourself daily you're going to have to come to the place where you're perfectly we think that it's you have no ability you have no Pride you're done that or not some big somebody not a know it all but a nobody anything I am I am by the grace of almighty God when you get to the place you realize you're not a big shot you're not somebody a kingdom I'm not able to then you're ready for God to begin to lift you up then you're ready for God to begin to use you like he did Paul he had to not paw off his eyes horse break him down to the Damascus to us and realize that he was going about a complete wrong way the very God that he claimed to be serving he was persecuting amen when you come down to that dust you got to come to dust brother am says amen then God is ready to use you amen now notice forget his own ability and yield himself to God amen God can achieve his purpose by not sending the Revival brother but what it needs is first is a killing so that we can you heard my saying I think last service we don't need a revive the flesh we need a Revival of the spirit too many times to buy the the flesh revives amen you have to die before you can be born again he needs the killing of ourselves this Tabernacle needs a killing me with and all of us we need a killing so that we can be revived to New Life A New Hope new experience hey man we need a day of mourning first praise the Lord you got to come to dust come to the place that you know that you're nothing then you're ready to start then God can shape you God can bold you God can use you I don't know what God's Gonna use you for I don't know but God's Gonna use you in some way it can use you for your abrahe can use you for your job for your workers those around you you'll be a reflection of Christ amen God makes a way amen now you're ready to follow God's way how many believe that these people all these people in this generation they did not come God's way they did not hear God's word they left the Miracles they love the discernment did I love the opening of the bind and so forth isn't that exactly how they did in Jesus they liked all that but when it came to the word huh the word they just couldn't take it even when the BAM says you know now brother abandon when he's in the pulp and so forth to discernment you know that's God but don't listen to his Doctrine you hypocrite God wouldn't back somebody like that up that was teaching false Doctrine amen oh my now let me go in a little bit different direction as we rise up what do you do you come to the death of yourself like Jesus said and then you begin to come God's way because God makes a way aren't you glad that God makes a way God's provide infinite way for this day I'm glad that he makes a way amen he's always made a way there's your way and there's his way is your ability and then there's Holy Ghost stability pray the Lord amen now notice we will talk about God raising us up a little bit giving us the right direction to go that he provides things for us that no matter what you face now it's a different story now that you raise up again by the power of the Holy Ghost amen God first of all has to give you faith to conquer yourself with amen we're saved by grace through faith that not of yourselves it's the gift of God God gives you Faith to conquer yourself with not only that but to believe that what Christ is on is for you when you genuinely believe that and how God is going to baptize the Holy Ghost and with power a new power it's rising whoa how many is that for that new power that new Strength now human self is dead keep him down there amen and out of the ashes let that new man rise let him come to his feet let him look like Christ act like Christ think like Christ talk like Christ he's a new man following God's provided way amen amen out of the message called God's provided way better man talks about having watched Ducks hats Arness up in the north and so forth now notice he says now you and you know those Ducks will be born up north they'll grow the whole summer long he says just let that first little cold breeze come off the top of a hill when that snow caps the mountains and them little ducks raise up from there amen and never seen I've been off the pound come straight to Louisiana as hard as they can it's nature the laws of nature they do it every year he says watch the geese over in Texas where many of them go I've seen the time that God had to stop the car on the road and they'd not be bothered by nobody they're thinking about going how you reading between the lines they got a revival going on all of all of them together to noise why it's worse than can't you feel a little breeze coming mothers and sisters can't you feel that Holy Spirit Breeze coming and Santa's about time to get up I live here time for the bride to become this word that to themselves to come up in newness of life oh my you never heard such when they get together why see what it is it's the laws of nature every year they get together and so forth and when they leave Northern British Columbia Winter's on the way you hear the geese going over screaming to attitude going south I can listen at them and cry because I see God guiding them oh when I got to thinking about how did God guide his children how did he teach that new man he has a leader for him let me just finish the duck story first can I will get on this other in a minute amen now notice what guides them to the pathless air oh my what guides them to the Past was there when it's nothing but a dumb brute what is it that he doesn't oh my talked about hear him going and y'all can you know that leader out there kind of taking his way maybe he's never winged his way to Louisiana before but he'll get there how many believe that we've never went this way but God's gonna have a way for us God's way that made a way for us he's taking his flight he's heading heading to her the whole swarm of them is a coming they may never have been there before big knows exactly where those rice paddies are but it's got rice because he got something that leads him something that's on the inside how many believe that that's the way it was with Paul after he got struck down to the running Masters amen he began to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they meant to lead him and to guide him oh my that's right now notice and then when spring comes when it's nice and warm down here amen he'll go right straight back up there again it's nature displaying itself it's the laws of God now he says prophets Arch God's chief sign he says God's chief sign is a prophet now I'm going to speak a few minutes about that they are his word made in manifest for that age and that's the reason that the prophet is always God's chief sign he has never sent a judgment upon the Earth without first sending a prophet just seeing scriptures like Noah like Moses like Elijah the prophets amen he sends them to manifest the word for that age to give his people a warning just the same as he sends a cool spell upon the Ducks run them to the north and to the South I'm here to change the light I feel like the power of the holy spirit amen is telling us that you better than I better you better run into Christ it's that time he got much time left amen God's chief sign is not so much that Cool Breeze but it's amen it's the signs of a prophet God send a prophet showed himself in a picture I like what sister Becky says whenever they got to talking about this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you might not like that picture too much but don't you know the story about the critic that had his finger up in him and all kinds of pictures that he took of brother bam he was going to put in the paper make himself look great and make him look

I even got to thinking about that I got to thinking about the Deep calling to the Deep and I wrote down here why did God give fish fins fins think about why he gave fish fins otherwise they'd all be sea snakes right they'd have to just wiggle through the water like that right sea snakes but it give them he knew that there would be water he made the water first right and he gave the fish fins so that he could guide himself how you like them little sidearms you're gonna continuously going this way always going like that isn't that right balancing themselves all right amen he put a tail on him even just writes and if he ever decides to take off like lightning but he you won't catch him the speed of a fish isn't that right they can go like who'da thought it God give them a way of Escape amen praise be to God and I thought wow Hallelujah that's the way God does with his children he makes a way he gives them something that they have need of to conquer every enemy that's in front of them something who was first God or the devil amen amen before there was a fish there had to be an ocean for the fish to swim in before you as a Victor there had to be something for you to have victory over aren't you glad for that that's another excite every one of us knowing that God has given you what you have need of he equips Paul he gives him what he has neither God equips his people Hallelujah just like he does the duck he put something in his nature oh I love this story Rebecca bam says man all of those Ducks Amen in the north whenever they begin to feel that breeze whatever amen there'll be a certain male quacker perhaps there'll be a certain duck amen and all of a sudden quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack and he'll come up and everybody else the biggest bunch of noise you ever heard y'all didn't expect cracking going on in the church tonight did you we even got a quack here no not really might call me a clock what is it better man says God

follow him he's your king and he says man you put him out there them Ducks they'd all turned their back they ain't worried about the sound that warmed up that knows what he's doing and I want you to know it was the sound of the voice of the seventh angel that caught your attention to just something about it sounded right that ain't nothing but the truth foreign [Applause] never went to Louisiana before but oh they'll go they'll go up and they'll leave that thing that water will splash him little feet up they go to the air way up there whole swarm go all the way to Louisiana they'll follow him right straight how many blades everyone that's gonna lead us right into a rapture right into the skies but before we go you're gonna have to get ready amen and that's what God's doing on a Wednesday night it's getting us ready getting rid of our abilities getting rid of our failures oh my God praise the Lord why did God give birds feathers well they'd be chickens I guess and stay Earthbound if they didn't have good Wings isn't that right amen God has provided everything that we ever have need of how many knows that because we're under his control now I mean we're under his domain under the power of Holy Ghost 24 7 everything we do amen I got to get to that place and I'm here to tell you I hope everybody's listening to church there's some of us that need to get to that place we're not there yet come on folks there's other things that take priority God so provides everything for you that I don't care if you don't know your next paychecks coming from I don't care if you're at the place and you're surrendered to God you don't know where your next meals come from I serve the kind of God that knows and dissipize your need I may believe that Jesus Christ knows the fall of us bear he knows the number of your hair amen he knows that you have need of these things but he's at seek first the kingdom of God and do you think shall be added unto you God will take care of you Paul he didn't have a whole lot but he always had what he needed Jesus he didn't have a whole lot but he was so surrendered he was that mighty warrior the mighty warrior that by the time he put out there that looks so great and fabulous so awesome that was Jesus humble that was Paul humble Mighty Warriors who had submitted themselves to almighty God and God could use them in such a way until Jesus if he did until he'd walk on water oh I've been needed to hit back bread and fish and they multiply the fishes in the loaves that's what God would do to a son and daughter of God if you whatever you have need of God would apply your need if you're in the place where God wants you to be if you're surrendered to God I may believe that I don't care what it is that you need he says if you say to this mountain be moved it'll do it God will move mountains for you I'm glad to be serving a God Like That most of us don't have to worry about where our next meal is coming from if you're like me you got two freezers one ain't enough have two freezers getting a little bit low now about time to butcher another one of them cows amen but there think about it but like I said but if you did if you wasn't the place you're so serving God like Paul is like Jesus did you don't know you know even Jesus had to pay his taxes they didn't have the money and they're right and he said go over here and catch this fish or whatever and get that money out of the fish's mouth somebody threw something in and they didn't realize that it was a whatever it was enough to pay their taxes where's the fish like the shininess of it and swallowed it or bit into it and he can't get it stunned stuck from his mouth I guess that's what it was he said got it out of the fish's mouth isn't that right God makes a way how many glad for God made in a way I am so thankful for that praise the Lord when God does something he does it right amen so I wrote down here listen to this now why also a man we could talk so much about that but little all of this but let me let me go there look at this for a minute why did God in our human heart in our human heart the profit daughter said the animal kingdom don't have it but in the human heart there's an extra little compartment there that's right amen y'all know he said that I'm not just making that up that right so he made it he designed it because God wanted that to be the control driver that was the place for your soul and it is also where God is supposed to be in where your heart God's supposed to be in there he's the one that's in control now amen he is leading us he is guiding us man a shift has to have the man has had to sift for himself if you're not a Christian you've got to sit for yourself I gotta sift for myself I'm glad God takes care of me aren't you glad God takes care of you he sure does and he's in here he's the one that's a preeminent one he's in that controlled power leading you guiding you but man we don't people just don't recognize don't realize that they do too much they try to guide themselves lead themselves fend for themselves you weren't made to be doing that you were made to rely on the leadership of almighty God amen thank God for it every age has always had um let me see here away made for them by God First Corinthians 10 and 13 says that no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God who is faithful will not suffer you to be tempted about that ye are able but will with that Temptation also make a way of Escape amen I thought about that make a way he's the way maker I like that song Don't you he always makes a way when there doesn't seem to be a way he always makes a way amen oh my when you're in the line of duty and you come up to a Red Sea huh Great Captain the Great Captain Jehovah told Moses I want you to go down between these rocks down here go down through here just go down through that crevice go down then there go way down in there it was a trap how far from that crevice or whatever it was it was a trap and he couldn't get back out and they heard it's a pharaoh and his horses coming right had to be pretty close and when they got down there there was a big old sea a big old water body they could never go across isn't that something couldn't go across God loves to bring you to that place loves to bring me to that place to where you can't go over it you can't go under it there's ah you can't go around it seems helpless and hopeless amen but that's when you got to yield yourself to God and God will open up the Red Sea for you if he needs to how many believes God is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same yesterday today and forever amen God will provide you with a get out of jail card free he can provide you with that isn't it right they put Paul and Silas in the inner prison and what was their obligation what did they do again to pray and sing songs worship God I just heard a testimony here of a Preacher talking about somebody amen that had something real bad disease gonna die and everything else all of a sudden when a certain word was spoken they began to rejoice and dance and scream and holler worship God went back to the doctor and didn't have any of it anymore amen just worship God he'll take care of it he'll open them prison Gates he'll open those bars he'll set you free because he always when he does something he does it right and he equips us how many believes the holy spirit is the equipment that you need to conquer every devil that you have in front of you he will supply every need that you have I have a scripture that I wanted to read to you of where you go when you come back up this is where you go Ephesians 3 and uh let me see here yes now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think aren't you glad to serve a God that can do more than you can think more than you can think amen oh my according to the power works Works in US amen I like to serve a God that can do way more than you can ask or ever think amen he is what we have neither he makes a way he gives us what we have need of Amen praise the Lord but we got to be willing to follow him how many is willing to follow him Lord whatever your way is I might as well say this before I forget to but let me tell you something I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ remember one place Peter Brown says the bride and church age book he says the bride does only his will no man can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they have the mind of Christ I mean he's a bride is going to do and fulfill the will of God not your will and the way you want to do it and the way you want to think but the way that God wants it done there's a couple of messages brother Brandon preaching I preachers here many times as most preachers do a lot of preaching again and again of ourselves and I do that too amen but listen to one thing he said you know he says after the seals and after desperation and all that he's just boy I'll tell you what do you know it doesn't matter how many dancers and how many religious demonstrations and all this that you've done he said you must have the token how he believes the Bride of Jesus Christ must have the token and what is the token the literal life of Jesus Christ mother bam said ain't that right he said that's what the token is it's very God's very own life Lord Jesus help Thomas Potter get the place where I only live his life I'm dead every day Die daily how many is let me say God help me to Die daily to myself the only way you'll ever know if you're really dead will find out how strong you are we'll find out how dead you are let somebody come do you wrong see how you react when somebody does you wrong slaps you in the face perhaps see if you punch him sucker punch him or if you turn the other cheeks like that man can you pray for him do you love him because there's another thing but a man says you got to have before you get in there and that's perfect love how many believe that can I give you a little inside information can I that was a question until you get it you get to try it again and again and again until you get that perfect love if you're going to be in the Rapture God's going to let you people you so oh boy I'll tell you what I didn't pass the test last week that guy hit me wrong and I tell you what ah well you get to do it again and again until you can have perfect love you can pray for that person I love that person not have no and I'm not City towers that person I'm going to finish up here tonight with some quotes is that okay listen to this Moses when he was called by God he was a total complete Prophet when since when God sends a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything that he has needed Oh Glory we should run the balcony we run all over the place and realize that if God does something and he puts you in this layout to see a little gourmet he's gonna give you something to overcome it with how many believe that he's gonna equip you if you're gonna get out of here you're gonna have to be equipped get out of here if you're gonna have overcoming you've got to have like the fish on the fish's back you're gonna have to have what it takes and God supplies us with What It Takes remember to lay out and see a church there they were lukewarm had need of nothing ratchet miserable for blind and naked but I Picasso divides for me to buy me gold tried in the fire and they'll give the eyes I said how many please he's given us icef he's giving us everything we have need of to be able to see amen and to be clothed upon him that the same shame of our nakedness do not appear amen this just comes to mind you can take it for what it's worth but won't it be a shame when people realize they weren't dressed for the Rapture they didn't have what it was going to take they're left behind it's gonna be a shame it's gonna be a shame amen oh I like that whatever he does God equips you he'll fix you up with what you have need of he fixed Paul up with what he had need of what is that that's himself I can do all things through Christ with strength and strengtheneth me I know how to abound and I know how to suffer need amen that's when he said that I can do all things through Christ's dream listen now notice let me just read this this is very good this is out of total Deliverance if our hearts condemn us he says now listen we want complete deliverance we don't want it halfway church we want a real church amen or no church at all we want to be real Christians or no Christians at all we want taller than leverage from our habits go so fast any bad habits Lord help me from our sins from our evil thinking from our evil doing for my negligence whatever we've done we want a total Deliverance so that when people come into this church to be prayed for this may be just a little group maybe a hundred to two sitting here they'll be completely but they'll be completely in the hands of God and when we pray then God will hear from Heaven God wants somebody that he can hold in his hands somebody that he can say I got confidence in that person I can send this my sick servant to the Branham Tabernacle and that group of people are in one Accord something will happen oh my well look look what he does in the next look what he does in the condition what would he do if we would love one heart of one Accord how many notes that if one person is thinking contrary to the holy spirit in the direction that God's going what person going contrary is a negative it's a it's a damp rag so to speak we need everybody everybody thinking the same thing if you want to read more about us being one and we'll be in the we'll get it listen to Total Deliverance he says a lot more in it but listen look what he does one Accord and the only we can do it is to unify our hearts together with brotherly love obey the offices of the church and the pastor and Obey and the pastor obey God then God works in the pasture through the board down into the church and all together our one unit to the kingdom of God then God will hear when we are a unified group let nothing bother you don't be dismayed in anything amen sister Sherry don't be dismayed we aren't dismayed in anything anything is possible for those that believe amen that's when the church shall be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood I mean please got to be under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking when you're gambling when you're cheating when you're stealing when you're lying when everything's brought under the blood then there'll be a total Deliverance and he wants to be up complete Christian I want to be a genuine real Christian I don't want to be halfway nothing you don't have to be the only oh my God thought about another coach it was right in here where it says you know the people that are halfway the reason they're halfway is because they got their own ways mixed up in God's program folks if we're not what we ought to be we still got a little bit of ourself in there here and out there in the streaming world if you're not what you ought to be remember you got your own ways mixed up in yet you're not the fireball Christian because you still got your own way Bennett you got to get order delivered from

of God he does nothing but what the father wrote him first how many wants to be that way everything I do I'm going to do in the spirit I don't want to be one thing that I do to be in the flesh in the self because it'll fail we are men and women we're also Christian if he's our example let us completely deliver ourselves into the hands of the Holy Ghost then we that we might be subjects of the kingdom of God he was totally man he was totally God but he surrendered his natural parts and his physical parts his own thinking his own doing his own cares I only do that which pleases the father
