[18:43] your Bibles tonight and we'll get right
[18:45] into the word I don't want to hold you
[18:47] long tonight I know it's a midweek it's
[18:49] been a dreary day and we're probably
[18:51] tired and and try to ease into this
[18:54] tonight if we can but turn in the in the
[18:55] scriptures to the Book of Luke chapter
[18:59] 15 and while you're turning there I want
[19:01] to read you a little quote that I come
[19:02] across and and um it it it goes with the
[19:07] service tonight but it it really I just
[19:09] found it out of out of uh I just found
[19:12] it in passing and I thought it was
[19:15] good but the prophet said God does
[19:18] everything in threes he wrote three
[19:21] Bibles he had three coming of Christ
[19:23] there's three dispensations of
[19:26] Grace there's the three manifestations
[19:28] of one one person in the godhead all
[19:30] those things he said now like Jesus came
[19:33] the first time he's been here once
[19:36] hasn't he he says he come to redeem his
[19:38] bride he comes the second time to
[19:40] receive his bride to catch her up in a
[19:42] meeting in the air and he comes the
[19:44] third time with his bride as king and
[19:47] queen aren't you looking forward to that
[19:49] day as king and queen he says see
[19:52] there's also three uh three uh there's
[19:55] three also there's three manifestations
[19:56] of God God manifested himself once in
[19:59] the fatherhood as he led the children of
[20:00] Israel next time God manifested himself
[20:03] in sunship the Lord Jesus Christ the
[20:05] third time God manifested himself is
[20:07] with us now the Holy Spirit see three
[20:11] manifestations everything in
[20:14] threes how many knows God's numbers
[20:16] three amen so as you you're in Luke
[20:20] chapter 15 we're going to read a portion
[20:22] of scripture here and uh we'll read a
[20:25] few
[20:27] verses
[20:29] if you got it say Amen am all right
[20:31] we're all on the same page then Drew
[20:34] near unto him all the publicans and
[20:37] sinners for to hear him and the
[20:39] Pharisees and the scribes murmured
[20:41] saying this man receiveth Sinners and
[20:44] eateth with them so look at the look at
[20:47] the attitude here we got these Pharisees
[20:49] and these scribes these he highminded
[20:51] and and Hy and and they're full of Pride
[20:54] and they're full of arrogance and and
[20:57] and they're sitting here and they're
[20:58] beginning to looking they trying to
[20:59] judge Jesus on this and here Jesus is
[21:01] and it says he spake this Parable unto
[21:04] them now watch now he's he's fixing to
[21:06] give them three different
[21:08] illustrations but it's still one Parable
[21:11] all the three make one so watch what he
[21:14] does here he says what man of you having
[21:18] aund sheep if he loses one of them does
[21:22] he leave the 9 and9 in the wilderness
[21:25] and go after that which is what lost
[21:29] until he finds it so here you got sheep
[21:32] you know if you know anything about
[21:34] sheep you know sheep are dumb sheep are
[21:36] real dumb animals I raise them and I've
[21:38] told you before they live to die when
[21:40] they B when they're born they lay there
[21:42] and they try to find every way they
[21:43] possibly can to die and so here the
[21:46] scriptures telling us that a sheep who
[21:48] is no doubt straight away from the rest
[21:50] of the flock and so this sheep that
[21:53] maybe he was just eating grass and he
[21:54] was in the congregation and he was
[21:56] eating and nibbling and he was right
[21:57] there with all of his brothers and
[21:58] sisters and he just begins to kind of
[22:00] get over here and pay attention exactly
[22:02] where he's going in life and he finds
[22:04] himself in darkness and now come all
[22:06] around him he thinks man I'm all by
[22:08] myself I'm all alone I have strayed away
[22:12] and the Bible tells us that this
[22:13] Shepherd is going to leave all 9 and N
[22:16] to go and get this
[22:19] one watch what he says and when he has
[22:22] found
[22:24] it aren't you thankful to be found when
[22:27] he found it
[22:29] he didn't put a halter on it he didn't
[22:32] lead it back and say come on you dumb
[22:34] animal no he picks it up a healthy Wella
[22:39] body sheep he picks it up throws it over
[22:42] his shoulder and he begins to tote it
[22:44] back
[22:46] rejoicing God won't let you stay out
[22:49] there and stray away he'll put you on
[22:51] his shoulders he'll carry you all the
[22:53] way he can he's going to get you where
[22:55] he wants you to
[22:57] be
[22:59] and when he cometh on he cth together
[23:01] his friends and his neighbors and his
[23:04] brothers and the sisters and the
[23:06] congregation and the pastor this is a
[23:09] big
[23:10] event he calls them together saying
[23:13] Rejoice with me Rejoice with me for I
[23:17] have found my sheep which was what
[23:24] lost I say unto you that likewise Joy
[23:27] shall be in heaven over one sinner that
[23:30] repenteth more than the 9 and N just
[23:32] persons that need no
[23:35] repentance so here we see God the son
[23:38] the Redeemer of those that was
[23:41] lost go on down to verse 8 and here's
[23:44] where I'm going to get my text
[23:46] tonight either that woman having 10
[23:49] pieces of silver if she lose one piece
[23:53] does not light a candle and sweep the
[23:56] house and she does what
[23:59] she seeks diligently say that seeks
[24:03] diligently she seeks diligently till she
[24:06] finds it and when she has found it she
[24:11] just sat around and said well
[24:14] finally she she just she just closed the
[24:18] door and and was quiet no it says when
[24:20] she found it she cth her friends she
[24:22] calleth her neighbors she call us the
[24:23] sisters of the church the congregation
[24:25] the pastor the deacons you say well
[24:27] you're adding that in We're All in This
[24:29] Together are we on are we all making
[24:32] this one race together sure we are so we
[24:35] why would we not call everybody say
[24:37] rejoice with me I found that now that I
[24:41] lost what Satan tried to take from me I
[24:44] seek until I found it and I got it
[24:47] [Applause]
[24:49] back and when she had found it she
[24:51] called her friends and the neighbors
[24:53] together saying Rejoice with me for I
[24:54] have found the peace which I had
[24:59] lost so here is God the Holy Spirit the
[25:01] light now lighten the way through the
[25:03] Holy Spirit to find that which is
[25:08] lost W you go ahead and have your seats
[25:10] for time sake we're going to just
[25:12] illustrate the last one for you may the
[25:15] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[25:16] the
[25:17] word his word is great and greatly to be
[25:22] praised and in the last one we see the
[25:24] the uh prodal we see the prodal son the
[25:28] the lost son as it said so we have a
[25:30] lost sheep a lost coin a lost son and we
[25:33] know that that prodical son he went out
[25:35] there he decided that his wasn't good
[25:38] enough for him anymore he decided he
[25:40] wanted to do it his way he decided he
[25:43] wanted to live the life he wanted to
[25:45] live even though he knew right he knew
[25:48] wrong he knew the limitations of God he
[25:50] knew the limitations of house he decides
[25:54] I'm going to do it my way so he finds
[25:55] himself straying out and going out on
[25:57] his own all by
[25:59] himself only to find out he's made a
[26:02] mockery only to find out he has turned
[26:05] himself away from a from the life he
[26:07] once knew the good life into a life now
[26:10] that is that debauched and
[26:13] ridiculous to the point that he has to
[26:15] come crawling back to his daddy and say
[26:18] just make me a servant whatever it takes
[26:20] just get me back in the
[26:23] house God the
[26:27] Father so here we see God does things in
[26:30] threes first he speaks of the love of
[26:33] God the the son the god uh second he
[26:36] speaks of the love of God the Holy
[26:37] Spirit third he speaks of the love of
[26:39] God the father and I'm going to message
[26:41] my uh title my message tonight if I
[26:43] could
[26:44] lost
[26:46] lost did you hear what I said
[26:49] lost now lost that's a that's a terrible
[26:53] condition to find yourself in if you
[26:55] lose something it it's a terrible place
[26:57] to be
[26:59] how many's ever lost something that you
[27:00] that you had maybe in your pocket or
[27:02] something you knew you put somewhere and
[27:04] you go to get it it's not there it's
[27:05] lost and it's a bad feeling when you
[27:08] start thinking about that and I want to
[27:10] look tonight at this woman and I want to
[27:13] focus on the coin that was lost in the
[27:15] second part of this Parable and if you
[27:18] look at the definition of the word lost
[27:20] it's something that has been taken away
[27:23] or cannot be
[27:27] recovered
[27:30] usually we lose things we begin to get a
[27:32] little bit stressed over it we begin a
[27:35] little panicked we get a little anxiety
[27:37] built up on
[27:38] it I'm talking about items I'm talking
[27:41] about pocket knives I'm talking about
[27:42] car keys I'm talking about those kinds
[27:44] of things but there are people who
[27:46] actually find themselves losing their
[27:51] identity and they have an identity
[27:53] crisis and they begin to lose their
[27:55] identity and maybe we sit here tonight
[27:58] some of you maybe have sat here and you
[27:59] think man maybe sometimes I feel like I
[28:01] have completely lost my
[28:03] identity who am I as a Christian who am
[28:06] I in the gospel who am I to God where is
[28:10] my place who am
[28:14] I maybe you feel like you've lost your
[28:17] identity maybe you have no idea what you
[28:18] want in life maybe you have no idea that
[28:21] and you look around everything's falling
[28:22] apart and you have no idea even who you
[28:24] are
[28:25] anymore this is a real this is a real
[28:28] [Applause]
[28:31] problem tonight by the grace of God
[28:33] we're going to find out how to fix
[28:35] it God don't want people losing their
[28:38] identity and if you you sit here and you
[28:41] look at identity crisis it could be
[28:43] something as simple as people ask you
[28:45] what you want for
[28:46] dinner and you think I don't
[28:49] know this is serious business you can
[28:52] find yourself in a place where people
[28:54] may ask you what is your song what's
[28:56] your favorite color what's your favorite
[28:58] car what's your dream car and you look
[29:00] at them with with a glaze across your
[29:02] eyes I don't
[29:05] know you don't know who you are anymore
[29:08] you've lost something and you're trying
[29:10] to gain it back you're trying to think
[29:12] what in the world did I lose why am I
[29:13] not the person I once was why is this
[29:16] void here and why is my life
[29:20] vacant has you ever been there yeah some
[29:24] of us have and we find ourselves there
[29:26] what is it it's the thing that once made
[29:29] you has gone
[29:32] missing think about that the very thing
[29:34] that made you who you
[29:37] were before you lost your identity has
[29:40] gone missing now how many Christians do
[29:42] we have here tonight amen you know I was
[29:45] reading what brother Brown was talking
[29:47] about he was fixing to preach on the
[29:48] prodical son and he began to preach on
[29:50] the prodical son and he said you know
[29:51] what he said I don't really know why I'm
[29:53] preaching this because everybody here is
[29:55] saved there's no Sinners here but I'm
[29:56] preaching on a prodical son
[30:05] something that you once made you has now
[30:08] seemingly
[30:10] missing you've lost something on the
[30:13] inside you've lost something that gave
[30:15] you drive you've lost something that
[30:17] gave you passion you lost something that
[30:20] you that made you care about things so
[30:23] much that now You've Lost That Care
[30:25] You've Lost That desire You've Lost That
[30:27] passion
[30:28] brothers and sisters and when that
[30:29] happens in our life begin to see that
[30:31] sin begins to creep in and that's when
[30:35] you find ourselves we begin to start
[30:37] falling short in our walk with God and
[30:40] and we see that sometimes these things
[30:41] have gone missing and the very thing
[30:43] that made us who is what what is what we
[30:45] are is missing and the prophet preached
[30:48] the message the second coming of the
[30:50] Lord he read this portion of scripture
[30:53] in
[30:54] Luke when he preached the second coming
[30:57] of the Lord
[30:59] and he said now I want you to think
[31:00] about this he says now it may seem like
[31:01] a very odd scripture for the second
[31:04] coming of Christ but it's speaking of
[31:07] the second coming of Christ so let
[31:10] scripture that on the parable what is it
[31:12] actually talking about brothers and
[31:14] sisters it's speaking about being ready
[31:17] it's speaking about having things in
[31:19] order it's speaking about having your
[31:22] eyes dotted and your tees
[31:25] crossed it's speaking about living your
[31:28] life to the fullness of the word of God
[31:30] and living by the fruits of the spirit
[31:32] living a life that is full of love and
[31:34] joy and peace and
[31:36] longsuffering it's talking about living
[31:38] a life that is that is full of
[31:40] gentleness and and faith and
[31:44] meekness that's what he's talking about
[31:46] and he said this great subject here as
[31:48] we get into it now he said it's one of
[31:50] the most vital subjects in the entire
[31:53] Bible and he's speaking about this
[31:55] tablet and he's talking about the coming
[31:58] of Christ the two in my mind don't line
[32:01] up as I begin to look at it I'm thinking
[32:04] what in the world how is he taking this
[32:06] scripture about this young lady losing a
[32:08] coin out of her headdress out of her
[32:11] tablet and how is he tying it to the
[32:13] second coming of
[32:15] Christ but he says there's nothing as
[32:18] important as the coming of our Lord
[32:20] Jesus Christ if he doesn't come we've
[32:22] been found as false Witnesses our dead
[32:24] that's in the grave they're perished
[32:26] there's no hope left for us if Jesus
[32:28] didn't come the second time watch what
[32:31] he goes to talking about next I'm just
[32:33] I'm just going to paraphrase this but he
[32:35] begins to talk and he says he talks
[32:37] about the rumors of wars and he begins
[32:40] to talk about
[32:41] earthquakes and listen he says Moscow
[32:45] and the missiles that they could place
[32:46] on the Fourth Street in Louisville
[32:50] Kentucky and he goes on to talk about
[32:53] the Fig Tree is putting forth her Bud
[32:56] now listen to what he says next and get
[32:58] a hold to this this sounds like we're
[33:00] reading yesterday's
[33:02] newspaper he says and have you been
[33:05] noticing in the paper that we the United
[33:07] States are taking sides with the
[33:13] Arabs and he says the handwriting is on
[33:16] the wall whoever blesses Israel will be
[33:19] blessed and whoever curses Israel will
[33:22] be cursed he says we're at the end time
[33:25] we are here and there is no way to stop
[33:28] it why is he tying these two
[33:31] illustrations together why is he talking
[33:33] about the end time and he's talking
[33:35] about this woman why because he want to
[33:37] make sure that that bride of Jesus
[33:39] Christ has herself ready she's made
[33:42] herself ready she has every bit of her
[33:45] tablet is in
[33:46] order she's not missing a
[33:50] piece she's not living just any old way
[33:53] she's not claiming Christianity and
[33:55] living a different life and he's trying
[33:58] to tell you it's so important to have
[34:00] yourself ready he says we're at the end
[34:03] time you can put an aisen Howard in
[34:04] every County and it would never stop
[34:07] it he says Jesus said these times would
[34:10] come we're
[34:12] here that's his words we're here we're
[34:16] right here at the verge of this it's
[34:18] later than we think so brothers and
[34:20] sisters we don't come to church just to
[34:22] occupy a Pew we don't come to church
[34:25] just to hear Fancy preaching we don't
[34:27] come to church just to hear good music
[34:29] or good singers we like those sure we do
[34:32] we go to clap we ought to
[34:35] praise but we come to make sure we find
[34:37] ourselves ready we come to make sure
[34:40] that we're checking up time we come to
[34:42] make sure that God is moving in our
[34:44] lives and we're not letting anything go
[34:47] [Applause]
[34:54] lost Jesus says he Likens us to a to a
[34:59] woman he
[35:00] says and in our subject tonight he
[35:05] says we found this
[35:07] woman and her husband had gone
[35:10] out so imagine this woman now she's
[35:13] sitting there a newly a newly married
[35:16] the Young Bride is sitting there and
[35:18] she's going about her business and she's
[35:20] taking care of the house chores kisses
[35:21] her sweetheart goodbye for the Day's
[35:23] Journey and she's sitting there and
[35:25] she's going there and all of a sudden as
[35:27] she's going through
[35:28] chores she begins to notice that she has
[35:31] lost one of the coins out of her
[35:35] tablet so let me ask you married sister
[35:39] something if you were to lose your
[35:42] engagement
[35:45] set all you married sisters got
[35:49] one yeah okay there you go all right I'm
[35:53] just making sure we're where're where
[35:54] we're supposed to be if you lose that
[35:57] engagement set how would that make you
[36:01] feel how would that make you feel if you
[36:03] lost that engagement set you no doubt
[36:06] you begin to feel hurt you begin to feel
[36:09] nervous you begin to feel feel maybe
[36:12] some depression and you'd be filled with
[36:14] sorrow and the pain of losing that ring
[36:17] would be devastating to you
[36:22] ladies not because of the monetary
[36:26] value some of you's Diamond may not be
[36:28] much bigger than a of
[36:31] sand it's not about the monetary value
[36:35] thank God for
[36:37] that I told my wife here a while back I
[36:39] said you know honey I already to try to
[36:40] find you a a new new set new engagement
[36:43] and we'll get you a new set a little
[36:44] bigger I don't need that she said this
[36:46] is just fine I said praise the Lord I
[36:49] like what I
[36:54] found but that ring it's not about the
[36:58] monetary value but it's it's because of
[37:00] the love that it represents between you
[37:03] and your
[37:05] husband he was attracted to you and he
[37:09] began to date you and he began to love
[37:12] you and he began to make memories with
[37:14] you and he made a commitment to you
[37:16] because you were everything he was
[37:18] looking for in
[37:26] a and so that engagement
[37:29] set that we're talking about that
[37:31] wedding ring that he gave you it's
[37:35] significant in the and that it matches
[37:38] the character and which he saw in
[37:41] you you were something special for him
[37:44] to put that ring on your finger am I
[37:46] right man you better say
[37:49] Amen it's going to be a long ride at
[37:52] home but you were something special he
[37:55] saw character in you and he he placed
[37:57] that ring and and the lady when she see
[37:59] when she accepts that ring she signifies
[38:02] to the bridegroom or the husband that
[38:04] you will always love
[38:06] him right man y'all ought to be a lot
[38:09] louder y'all quiet that she will always
[38:12] love him she'll cherish
[38:16] him in
[38:19] sickness and in health you've heard
[38:21] these
[38:22] before for richer or for
[38:25] poor you'll be committed to him till
[38:28] death do you
[38:31] part so when that ring was placed on
[38:34] your fingers it now signifies and it
[38:36] tells the whole world that that is Miss
[38:40] pal that's who she
[38:43] is Miss Langley that's Miss Wade Miss
[38:48] Bor when you wear that ring it signifies
[38:51] that there's been an identity change to
[38:54] take place then now you belong to to
[38:59] someone you don't see the man put on a
[39:01] ring
[39:02] until the final day right but that woman
[39:06] then once she puts on that ring it tells
[39:08] the world that you're off
[39:10] limits and so the prophet that's why he
[39:13] said if a if a woman is married now this
[39:15] may step on a toe or two but if a woman
[39:18] is married she should wear a wedding
[39:20] ring as a sign she's
[39:24] married I've seen some that don't I
[39:26] think you should he said you should he
[39:29] said because what that does it it keeps
[39:31] other men from having anything to do
[39:34] with her he said and they look and they
[39:37] see that she is a married woman so
[39:40] brothers and sisters the fruits of the
[39:42] spirit are displayed in the
[39:44] life as you put on that ring you begin
[39:47] to display who you are and this tablet
[39:49] displays who you are and and as you put
[39:52] it display the fruits of the spirit in
[39:54] your life it tells Satan that this
[39:56] vessel is
[39:58] taken this vessel is off limits this
[40:01] vessel cannot be
[40:03] touched
[40:06] amen you see back in those days they
[40:08] didn't have wedding
[40:10] rings they had a
[40:12] tablet and this tablet was either worn
[40:15] across the headband or it was a necklace
[40:18] that they wore around their neck you've
[40:20] seen pictures of the Jewish girls and
[40:22] they have those little gold coins
[40:23] hanging around a band right you've seen
[40:26] those right
[40:27] that's not just a part of costume
[40:29] jewelry that means they're
[40:31] taken that's the tablet that's the
[40:33] headband that the prophet's talking
[40:35] about and so he says it has 10 coins in
[40:37] it those coins were dramas and those
[40:41] dras were worth each about about a day
[40:44] wage each so you can figure about 10
[40:45] days
[40:46] Wages that's not much of a value on a
[40:49] diamond ring is
[40:51] it like I said it wasn't about the value
[40:54] of the tablet it was about the ation
[40:57] that went along with it it was about the
[41:00] sincerity of what it meant to him it
[41:02] meant that this was a married woman and
[41:04] no man was the fool with them no boys
[41:06] were to FL with them because they were
[41:08] married and brothers and sisters that
[41:10] was their identity and the prophet said
[41:13] each one of those coins meant something
[41:16] and he says that those coins that were
[41:18] in place they meant a certain virtue to
[41:20] a woman the first one meant her love to
[41:23] her husband and he said the second one
[41:25] meant that she would pledge her virt you
[41:27] to live clean for him and he said the
[41:31] third and the fourth and 5ifth and 9th
[41:32] and 10th it goes on on and he says but I
[41:35] want you to listen close here I want you
[41:37] to listen real close because this is why
[41:39] we needed a prophet of the hour a
[41:41] messenger to come and bring us and break
[41:43] open the word of God not only in
[41:45] marriage and divorce and serpent seed
[41:47] and godhead and water baptism but in the
[41:49] simple things that we get overlooked and
[41:51] the church world overlooks the church
[41:53] World here they say that the woman in
[41:56] the parable represents the Holy
[41:58] Ghost that's what the church world says
[42:01] that the woman in the parable represents
[42:03] the Holy Ghost looking for a for a lost
[42:07] soul what the prophet
[42:11] said he said if you look it up look in
[42:14] Galatians 5 and he said you will find
[42:17] out that that woman represented the
[42:21] church and woman rep and that woman
[42:24] represents the church and the church as
[42:26] an INSP Ed wife to
[42:29] Christ boy that changes the whole
[42:31] perspective of that Parable doesn't it
[42:34] yeah sure it does and and he says the
[42:36] the tablet and the church is supposed to
[42:38] wear is found in Galatians 5 which is
[42:41] love joy peace long suffering
[42:44] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[42:47] can you see those coins now do you see
[42:49] what they represent to the Bride of
[42:51] Jesus Christ do you see why it's so
[42:53] important that we take this Parable we
[42:55] look at and say let the holy fill my
[42:57] life so that I can find whatever I've
[43:00] lost if I've lost my joy I need to find
[43:02] it if I've lost my peace I need to find
[43:07] it let's just turn to Galatians
[43:13] 5 oh we're moving good
[43:18] tonight there's a hair on me and I tell
[43:20] you what it's like a hair and a
[43:22] biscuit that thing won't come
[43:26] off
[43:28] Galatians
[43:30] 5 this I say
[43:33] then walk in the
[43:38] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[43:41] lust of the flesh isn't that
[43:44] something all you got to do is walk in
[43:46] the spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[43:50] lust of the flesh so if you're walking
[43:53] in joy and love and peace and
[43:55] longsuffering and meekness and gous
[43:57] patience kindness if you're walking in
[43:59] all those that's what the spirit is
[44:02] Right ain't that what God said he was
[44:05] that's what the spirit is so if you're
[44:06] walking that you shall not fulfill the
[44:09] lust of the flesh the prophet said
[44:11] there's two factions on the earth the
[44:13] believer the unbeliever the one of the
[44:15] Lord is coming to receive the on is of
[44:17] the Lord is coming to condemn he said at
[44:20] his coming the one he will bless the
[44:21] other one he will curse so here These
[44:24] two factions are for it says for the
[44:27] flesh lusteth against the
[44:30] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[44:33] and these two are contrary to one
[44:36] another so you can imagine Satan shoots
[44:40] a dart at you and the Holy Ghost puts a
[44:43] shield up to deflect it as long as
[44:46] you're behind the shield of the Holy
[44:47] Ghost living in the spirit of Christ
[44:50] Satan can shoot dart after Dart after
[44:52] Dart and he will never get by The Shield
[44:55] of the Holy Ghost yes you shall not walk
[44:59] and fall to the lust of the
[45:02] flesh so let him
[45:04] shoot he's going to shoot brothers and
[45:07] sisters I don't care if you're 15 25 55
[45:12] 95 or 105 Satan is going to shoot darts
[45:16] at
[45:19] you now the works of the flesh are
[45:21] manifest and these are uhoh adultery
[45:25] fornication uncleanly
[45:27] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[45:29] hatred variance emulations wrath Strife
[45:33] seditions heresies envyings murdering
[45:36] drunkenness revelings man that don't
[45:38] sound like the kind of guy I want to
[45:39] hang around with that guy right there
[45:41] gets you in trouble that guy right there
[45:43] take you down roads and streets that you
[45:45] don't want to find yourself
[45:49] down and watch what he
[45:52] says the like such are the like of those
[45:54] which I tell you before as I as I have
[45:57] also told you in times past they which
[46:00] do such
[46:03] things might make it end no that's not
[46:06] what it says they that do such things
[46:09] shall not inherit the kingdom of God so
[46:13] if you find yourselves in this kind of
[46:15] attitude it's this Pharisee sadducee
[46:17] scribe kind of attitude
[46:21] prideful
[46:23] arrogant full of hatred you're better
[46:26] than every
[46:29] everybody nobody can do nothing right
[46:31] you're so critical of everybody you know
[46:33] the Pharisees were some of the most
[46:34] critical people there
[46:36] were if you find yourself there doing
[46:39] these things you shall not inherit the
[46:42] kingdom of God but I love it when the
[46:46] when the when the word puts a butt in
[46:48] there but the fruit of the spirit is
[46:50] love and joy and peace longsuffering
[46:52] gentleness goodness faith faithful Faith
[46:54] meekness Temperance against such there
[46:56] is no law praise the Lord he says if we
[47:01] live in the
[47:02] spirit let us walk in the
[47:07] spirit you say what do you mean by that
[47:10] that means everywhere you go you're
[47:11] displaying love everywhere you go you're
[47:14] displaying
[47:15] Joy
[47:18] amen that means on your
[47:21] job in Fr of all them Burly
[47:24] men you're showing love you're showing
[47:27] Joy you're showing peace why CU that's
[47:30] what God gave to
[47:35] you at
[47:36] school wherever you go you're walking
[47:39] like that you say well brother if if I
[47:43] that they're going to laugh at me if I
[47:46] do that that they're going to call me
[47:47] crazy they're going to call me a fanatic
[47:50] they're going to call me a holy rer well
[47:52] I'll tell you what if you continue to do
[47:54] that one of these days they call you
[47:55] gone they're not going to see you
[47:58] anymore because they're going to be here
[47:59] you're going to be there there's going
[48:01] to be a Rapture to take place and you
[48:03] won't be there
[48:04] anymore they won't be able to call you
[48:06] nothing that be saying where is he at he
[48:08] ain't showed up for work in the last 20
[48:10] days he must have got another job now he
[48:13] got another
[48:20] body so that's why the prophet when he
[48:22] preached this message the second coming
[48:24] of Christ he said there ought to be a
[48:26] time right now that the church ought to
[48:27] take inventory and find out what coins
[48:31] she's got
[48:35] amen you say well I I got most of them
[48:40] we'll find out that ain't good
[48:43] enough well I I got everything but but
[48:46] I've got everything but patience man I
[48:48] tell you
[48:50] what that longsuffering patience I tell
[48:55] you
[48:59] that ain't good
[49:02] enough we're living in a tremendous time
[49:04] and and the Very halts and clouds of
[49:07] destroying civil civilization is hanging
[49:09] over the
[49:11] Earth and he said it's a tremendous time
[49:13] when there's wickedness and people just
[49:15] go to church for a
[49:21] sham people go to church to try to hide
[49:24] from their meanness people people go to
[49:27] church to try to profess Christianity
[49:28] and live like the rest of the world
[49:30] doing everything drinking smoking
[49:31] gambling women and moly dress wearing
[49:33] clothes they ought to be wearing in
[49:35] their own dressing room out on the
[49:38] streets notice he said clothes that they
[49:40] shouldn't be wearing in their own
[49:41] dressing rooms out on the
[49:44] streets and he said andly love is a
[49:47] thing that's
[49:50] passing
[49:51] huh now I don't think he's talking to
[49:54] this
[49:54] church because I know I I've seen a love
[49:57] and I've seen a compassion and I've seen
[49:58] a brotherly kindness that is that has
[50:00] begin to take over and sweep through
[50:01] this church like it's never been seen
[50:03] before God is doing something special
[50:07] God is doing something special in this
[50:08] last hour and if you haven't seen it
[50:10] open your eyes and get yourself ready
[50:12] because it's not brother and
[50:16] sister he says we have not lost one coin
[50:19] but we've practically lost every one of

[56:13] loling I thought it was a misprint I've
[56:15] heard of L Lolly gagging but he says
[56:18] they're Lolly and I looked it up it
[56:19] means to sit to hang down in a relaxed
[56:21] informal or uncontrolled way or a waste
[56:24] of time
[56:29] he says the church has no conscience
[56:32] anymore that's where we got to be
[56:35] careful that when we come to church it's
[56:37] a Growing
[56:38] Experience not trying to grow numbers
[56:41] sure we want to see people come in every
[56:42] day I wish every Pew every seat in this
[56:44] Pew in this building the balcony
[56:46] standing in the foyer I wish it was full
[56:48] of people if they're willing to search
[56:50] and seek and find
[56:52] God if they want to change if they want
[56:54] a life full of love and peace and joy in
[56:57] longsuffering but numbers is just
[56:59] numbers souls are
[57:03] [Music]
[57:05] souls we can't lose our
[57:08] light we can't lose our Holy Ghost he
[57:10] said the Lutheran Church lost those the
[57:12] methodists the Pentecostals they lost
[57:15] theirs he said but we're at the endc the
[57:18] coming of the Lord and his house

[57:38] might we say this was so important she
[57:42] she began to scour it say she took down
[57:44] the swept Down the Walls she took down
[57:46] the cobwebs and she kept on until she
[57:49] found what she had
[57:51] lost brother and sisters she was
[57:54] determined not to quit until she could
[57:55] grab a hold of what made her who she
[58:04] was because she knew this tablet was her
[58:08] life on display for the whole world to
[58:12] see and tonight without all of the
[58:14] fruits of the spirit on display in our
[58:16] lives we can't fully display

[1:02:26] for what God has done for
[1:02:29] me I started preaching at about 25 years
[1:02:33] old and this is not to to lift myself or
[1:02:36] pick any scabs anywhere so don't think
[1:02:38] don't take it that way it's not for that
[1:02:40] but it's to give glory to God and expose
[1:02:43] Satan for the for the for the things he
[1:02:44] does in people's lives because if it was
[1:02:47] me yesterday it may be you tomorrow
[1:02:50] that's
[1:02:51] right and I started preaching about 25
[1:02:54] years old just young and things were
[1:02:58] going really good we were here brother B
[1:03:00] was our pastor and sister Donna from the
[1:03:03] time we were 16
[1:03:05] right they came about the time I started
[1:03:07] coming to church 16 years old he took
[1:03:09] the church so about 25 I I felt the call
[1:03:12] and I began to minister the word and
[1:03:15] things were going good and and and
[1:03:16] friendships were being
[1:03:18] made I I got to I got to KN ministers
[1:03:21] really
[1:03:23] close ministers are prominence around
[1:03:25] the message and they're still my
[1:03:27] friends dear
[1:03:29] friends but I'm going to show you how
[1:03:31] Satan
[1:03:33] works and I felt my Ministry was growing
[1:03:36] and that God was going to use me fast
[1:03:39] forward 10
[1:03:41] years and that same Ministry that was
[1:03:44] growing and doing so well the wheels
[1:03:46] fell off of
[1:03:50] it it
[1:03:53] collapsed it was like a house of cards
[1:03:56] if I could use that illustration you
[1:03:58] pull that one
[1:04:02] card and it folds on
[1:04:07] you and Satan began to attack me and hit
[1:04:11] me from every angle that you could
[1:04:13] imagine even to the point of my
[1:04:17] health friendships people
[1:04:21] rumors hatred envies jealousies
[1:04:27] at
[1:04:30] me me being young still at the
[1:04:34] time I allowed Satan to take my love for
[1:04:38] the
[1:04:42] people you say that's hard to say you
[1:04:44] better believe it's hard to say but I
[1:04:47] allowed Satan to come in and take and
[1:04:49] just steal away my love for people and
[1:04:53] he took my joy and he took my happiness
[1:04:56] he took my joy he took my happiness and
[1:04:58] serving him and serving others I had no
[1:05:02] longsuffering you done me
[1:05:05] wrong I tell you what you're damned to
[1:05:10] hell no
[1:05:13] longsuffering and he took it all he
[1:05:15] gripped it and he took a hold of
[1:05:18] it not only did he take my love for
[1:05:21] people but he be to replace it with
[1:05:25] hatred
[1:05:28] and
[1:05:32] anger terrible
[1:05:37] anger you say that don't sound like
[1:05:41] you it wasn't me you're right that
[1:05:44] wasn't me that wasn't me at all but I
[1:05:48] had lost some coins in my
[1:05:50] tablet I had lost some coins in my
[1:05:53] tablet and I allowed Satan to come and
[1:05:55] take portions of who I
[1:05:58] was and he made me an incomplete
[1:06:04] Christian and with this
[1:06:09] hatred I'm being honest with you don't
[1:06:11] hold it against me learn from it with
[1:06:14] this hatred there was times if somebody
[1:06:17] would have pushed my button the wrong
[1:06:18] way I would have killed
[1:06:24] him
[1:06:26] people hurt me they hurt my family they
[1:06:30] hurt my children they hurt my
[1:06:35] wife and you want to talk about a bowl
[1:06:37] up inside of
[1:06:40] you how could that
[1:06:44] happen where was my joy where was my
[1:06:46] peace where was my love where was my
[1:06:48] servitude for the people that I love so
[1:06:50] much and now I hated
[1:06:54] them
[1:06:57] for the next 10 years brothers and
[1:06:59] sisters I wasted what time God could
[1:07:01] have been using me full of
[1:07:05] hatred and
[1:07:09] Malice and and I can remember how many
[1:07:13] watched the youth services at
[1:07:16] Louisiana some of you a couple of you
[1:07:18] some of you did some of you well anyway
[1:07:20] I'm going to tell you what happened and
[1:07:21] and and this is going to I'm going to
[1:07:22] show you how God brings things
[1:07:24] around
[1:07:28] so we for 10 years I hated that those
[1:07:33] the hated
[1:07:35] people and I was
[1:07:37] wallowing in anger and I was wallowing
[1:07:40] in blame and I was wallowing in
[1:07:46] negativity some of you it's been hurt
[1:07:48] bad know where I'm talk where I'm
[1:07:51] going it it's such a terrible
[1:07:54] feeling
[1:07:56] because that's not
[1:07:58] you and you don't want to be that
[1:08:01] way and I can remember I called brother
[1:08:04] Ron
[1:08:05] Spencer and I don't remember much about
[1:08:08] the
[1:08:09] conversation but I can remember I was
[1:08:11] unloading to him I was looking for
[1:08:12] somebody to vent to and for somebody to
[1:08:14] take my
[1:08:16] side well you know he's a pretty wise
[1:08:20] fell he didn't take nobody's side he
[1:08:23] didn't even make an offer
[1:08:28] I thought man what kind of buddy are
[1:08:31] you this was my this was my one of my my
[1:08:34] biggest Confidant I I loved this man I
[1:08:36] looked up to this man I respected this
[1:08:38] man no words of
[1:08:44] wisdom so after years of
[1:08:47] misery and holding on to these and I
[1:08:51] think my wife would say it's okay to say
[1:08:54] this she held on to is worse maybe it's
[1:08:56] worse than I
[1:08:58] did but you know we come to a place and
[1:09:01] I said you know what this is not
[1:09:04] working this is not us this is not who
[1:09:08] we are we've allowed Satan to Rob us
[1:09:12] we've allowed Satan to Rob us of our
[1:09:14] freedom we've allowed Satan to Rob us of
[1:09:16] our love not only our love but the love
[1:09:19] of Christ the love of church the love of
[1:09:22] the
[1:09:24] message and it was robbing my
[1:09:28] children and we needed a
[1:09:31] change so we we decided there at one
[1:09:34] point we were going to go to a
[1:09:35] denominational church I'm not going to
[1:09:36] name the
[1:09:37] denomination man they they were good
[1:09:39] they had good singing the preacher
[1:09:40] preached good messages man it don't feel
[1:09:45] us when you've been eating Eagles
[1:09:48] food come on scratch grain don't taste
[1:09:50] too good that's
[1:09:53] right but we Toler why because we
[1:09:56] couldn't look at
[1:10:00] people so we did that for a while and we
[1:10:02] said you know what we we we can't
[1:10:04] continue to do
[1:10:05] this we we know
[1:10:09] better so we begin to find ourselves and
[1:10:12] we we begin to make a decision where can
[1:10:14] we
[1:10:18] go we couldn't come here and still too
[1:10:20] many hurt
[1:10:24] feelings
[1:10:27] and if you go somewhere and you got
[1:10:28] anger there's no need in going that's
[1:10:32] right come on brother Steve thanks for
[1:10:34] helping me I'm glad somebody else knows
[1:10:36] where I
[1:10:38] walked you can't go there because
[1:10:40] there's anger in the every little word
[1:10:42] to S I know he's putting that right in
[1:10:43] me I'll tell you what if I could
[1:10:47] just so we decided we go to
[1:10:51] Murphysboro two hours
[1:10:53] away two hours every Sunday for 2 years
[1:10:57] and people thought we were crazy man
[1:11:00] behind behind the closed doors you could
[1:11:02] hear the
[1:11:04] Mings I don't know why they going over
[1:11:06] there they go to church just down the
[1:11:07] road I don't know why they're going over
[1:11:08] there they go over here I don't know why
[1:11:09] they're going over there looks like they
[1:11:10] get over
[1:11:12] this two years for two hours every day
[1:11:16] you say well well why why did you have
[1:11:18] to go there because we were hurting so
[1:11:20] bad we needed a trauma
[1:11:24] unit you know sometimes as Christians we
[1:11:26] get hurt so
[1:11:28] bad that just going to church ain't
[1:11:30] enough you got to have somebody that can
[1:11:33] that can look at you through a different
[1:11:34] set of eyes who can go through an MRI
[1:11:37] who can look through an x-ray who can go
[1:11:39] through there and fix the bones that are
[1:11:40] broke and the wounds that are deep and
[1:11:42] gashing and
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:48] bleeding so we had to go somewhere that
[1:11:50] we could not that we could not point
[1:11:52] fingers at
[1:11:54] anybody
[1:11:59] and
[1:12:00] slowly over the next two years under the
[1:12:04] ministry of the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost God began to call us talk to us to
[1:12:12] me that anger I began to realize there
[1:12:15] was really not that much to be angry
[1:12:17] about it was mistakes
[1:12:21] everywhere it wasn't me it wasn't them
[1:12:25] it was
[1:12:30] us and I begin to realize that if I
[1:12:33] could forgive them I might be able to
[1:12:36] love
[1:12:38] them and if I could love them the way I
[1:12:41] used to I might be able to have joy back
[1:12:44] in my life and so we begin to do this
[1:12:46] and we begin to go there and I begin to
[1:12:48] get there and I thought you know what I
[1:12:50] know during this I know beyond a shadow
[1:12:53] of doubt I never lost my calling
[1:12:56] I never lost my Christianity I was still
[1:12:58] a child of
[1:13:02] God but I just didn't have all the
[1:13:06] goods you think he saved me to lose me
[1:13:10] did he save you to lose you no no matter
[1:13:13] what you go through it's just a Turning
[1:13:15] Page it's a turning
[1:13:17] point and so we begin to find ourselves
[1:13:19] we begin to move forward and we begin to
[1:13:21] find out that there was there was
[1:13:22] longsuffering after all
[1:13:26] and what I begin to find out is I begin
[1:13:27] to find out that there was more
[1:13:30] longsuffering than had ever been
[1:13:33] before because I realize that even
[1:13:36] though we're Christians even though
[1:13:37] we're filled with the Holy Ghost even
[1:13:39] though our lives are supposed to walk in
[1:13:41] a certain way full of love joy peace
[1:13:43] longsuffering gous meekness kindness
[1:13:45] we're
[1:13:47] human and until that human element is
[1:13:49] gone we're going to have these doarts
[1:13:51] thrown at
[1:13:53] us so slow we begin to find ourselves
[1:13:56] want to get back in church and so I want
[1:13:58] to do something for the Lord I'm feeling
[1:14:00] good I'm ready I'm I'm want to preach
[1:14:02] but you know what we're driving two
[1:14:03] hours I can't be there on Wednesdays
[1:14:05] what kind of preacher can preach if he
[1:14:06] can't be at church ever
[1:14:10] service so God says to make a
[1:14:14] decision you're going to have to go back
[1:14:16] and face
[1:14:19] people is this all
[1:14:22] right you're going to have to go back
[1:14:23] and face people
[1:14:29] yeah I can never forget the anxiety when
[1:14:33] we walk through those
[1:14:37] doors will they accept
[1:14:40] us were they
[1:14:45] foged
[1:14:47] no it was
[1:14:53] brother so time time begins to go
[1:14:57] on and and and you know that that
[1:15:00] calling that I had that that that God
[1:15:03] give me is want is want to is want to
[1:15:07] manifest but yet I'm still a little bit
[1:15:10] on this outskirts of trust you know when
[1:15:13] somebody's been hurt trust is sometimes
[1:15:16] a hard thing to gain
[1:15:19] back so I didn't want to say nothing I
[1:15:21] don't want to do nothing but I have a
[1:15:23] Praying Wife
[1:15:28] Andrew Glover come here to preach I
[1:15:30] stayed home I didn't I didn't I didn't
[1:15:32] want to come I was still in that battle
[1:15:35] I want to do it I know I got to do it I
[1:15:36] know I need to do it I need to be there
[1:15:38] but yet I still not just quite
[1:15:42] ready and she comes up for prayer when
[1:15:44] Andrew Glover was here this was several
[1:15:46] years ago and they prayed and prayed and
[1:15:48] prayed that I would find myself that I
[1:15:50] would get back into the pool pit that I
[1:15:51] would be preaching again that that we
[1:15:53] would get back full of love and joy pece
[1:15:55] and longsuffering and he gave her a
[1:15:57] handkerchief now I don't know if she
[1:15:58] stuck it under my pillow I don't know if
[1:16:00] she tied it to my socks I don't know if
[1:16:03] she held on to it or what she done with
[1:16:04] it but for a year a year and a half two
[1:16:07] I don't know two years she held on to
[1:16:10] that prayer cloth to that
[1:16:14] handkerchief until one day I told
[1:16:16] Brother B I said brother B I think I'm I
[1:16:18] think I'm ready if you'll if you'll have
[1:16:23] me I went home we talked about it Andrew
[1:16:27] Glover was supposed to preach the next
[1:16:29] week here so we get ready for church
[1:16:32] come Sunday I didn't know about this
[1:16:33] handkerchief now you know women do
[1:16:35] things they
[1:16:39] secret she comes up to him and she says
[1:16:41] here take this what am I supposed to do
[1:16:43] with that I don't need that you give it
[1:16:46] to Andrew Glover and tell him it's
[1:16:51] finished she said he prayed for you he
[1:16:55] prayed for you he prayed for you and he
[1:16:56] gave me this this anointed cloth and
[1:16:58] told me to continue to pray for you
[1:17:00] until you find yourself back in the pull
[1:17:03] pit I come to church walked through that
[1:17:06] door walked up this steps like I owned
[1:17:07] the place walked right through that door
[1:17:09] I said here this is yours I don't need
[1:17:11] it
[1:17:15] [Applause]
[1:17:20] anymore can I give 10 more
[1:17:23] minutes fast forward to this year
[1:17:27] Louisiana camp that camp was for one
[1:17:30] person
[1:17:34] me you know it don't matter preachers
[1:17:38] want to preach
[1:17:39] right preachers want to share preachers
[1:17:42] want to
[1:17:45] help Friday night yes Friday night they
[1:17:49] had a little altar call and said all the
[1:17:51] ministers come up and it wasn't it was
[1:17:53] just kind of standing in the room only
[1:17:55] and the ministers were stepping up
[1:17:56] people and I didn't
[1:17:58] go I guess I was the only Minister there
[1:18:00] didn't
[1:18:05] go and you know sometimes preachers get
[1:18:07] the wowy Woos
[1:18:09] too and so on the way back to the to the
[1:18:13] room after that night I told Jo I said
[1:18:17] you know I don't know if my ministry
[1:18:18] will ever go anywhere I don't know if
[1:18:20] it'll ever do anything I don't know if
[1:18:21] it ever helps anybody maybe people just
[1:18:23] tolerate me

[1:19:04] Glover I'm going to share this with him
[1:19:05] I told him I had a story to share with
[1:19:07] him it's funny how God has a sense of
[1:19:09] humor in
[1:19:10] things because Andrew Glover I I didn't
[1:19:13] like him for a while cuz I thought who
[1:19:15] is this 19y old boy think he
[1:19:21] is are any of you human yeah amen praise

[1:19:36] preaching on Saturday morning and we're
[1:19:39] sitting there and he's talking and he's
[1:19:41] just preaching and just out of the way
[1:19:42] and I remember the night before I had
[1:19:44] the wowy wounds and I was like nobody
[1:19:46] knows me nobody
[1:19:47] cares and he says that man sat right
[1:19:50] back there brother Brad pal he said his
[1:19:53] wife come up to pray for him I gave her

[1:20:00] back in the pull pit he knows who he
[1:20:11] is it gets

[1:20:20] that Saturday night Ron Spencer's
[1:20:23] preaching
[1:20:25] my
[1:20:27] buddy and I I I'm listening to brother

[1:20:31] prodal man he's wearing that prodal
[1:20:34] out let me back up we go to the
[1:20:37] ministers meeting before we knew we was
[1:20:38] going to have a prayer line and and
[1:20:40] brother te I want to get everybody all
[1:20:41] the ministers together and talk about
[1:20:43] how this was going to operate and and
[1:20:45] what we you know the spirits we' be
[1:20:46] facing and and so forth and how to
[1:20:49] conduct and so forth and when I walked
[1:20:53] into the room
[1:20:55] there come brother Ron in the door he
[1:20:56] come over there with them
[1:20:58] arms he said you
[1:21:00] know when you called me that
[1:21:03] day he said I was standing under a power
[1:21:07] line and he said when I hung up the
[1:21:09] phone I fell to my knees and I prayed
[1:21:11] for you like never
[1:21:14] before and I was wondering why don't he
[1:21:16] give me any advice why don't he share
[1:21:19] any wisdom why don't he tell me what to
[1:21:21] do why don't he call me why don't he see
[1:21:25] how I'm
[1:21:27] doing you know sometimes we have to walk
[1:21:29] through Dry
[1:21:33] places we had prayer and the service is
[1:21:35] going and and he's preaching he's he's
[1:21:37] laying all this stuff out on the prodal
[1:21:40] and he's standing I'm sitting about
[1:21:42] where Adriana is I guess you'd say
[1:21:44] compared to the pull pit and he's
[1:21:46] walking over way and then those
[1:21:50] eyes they fixed on
[1:21:53] me I thought oh Lord what's he going to
[1:21:57] do and if you've ever been under SE
[1:22:00] brother Ron under the anointing his eyes
[1:22:03] have a different kind of fire about them
[1:22:06] and I knew as soon as he laid those eyes
[1:22:07] on me something was different I seen it
[1:22:10] him in one other time and that was when
[1:22:12] Adriana come up for prayer once and
[1:22:14] brother Ron and I prayed for you I don't
[1:22:16] know where we were at or what we was
[1:22:17] doing but those eyes were like a glow of
[1:22:19] fire and he fixed Those Eyes Upon me and
[1:22:23] he said you were used this morning
[1:22:25] wasn't
[1:22:26] you
[1:22:28] yep I'm going to use you

[1:22:46] he's my friend he's my
[1:22:48] buddy and he said he called me one
[1:22:51] day he said and I could pick up such a
[1:22:55] negative
[1:22:56] attitude of
[1:23:00] hatred and
[1:23:04] anger and he said I hung up the phone
[1:23:07] and he said you know a lot of people
[1:23:08] would say well he is going to get what
[1:23:10] he's got coming he said but I didn't do
[1:23:13] that he said I was standing under a
[1:23:15] power line and I fell down to my
[1:23:18] knees and he said I began to pray for
[1:23:22] him and I thought that was the end of
[1:23:24] the story and I thought well people are
[1:23:27] kind of starting to know who I am and he
[1:23:28] looks he said and he's a
[1:23:32] preacher and he said you mean preachers
[1:23:34] can have those things happen to them he

[1:26:45] child of God they've proven they're a
[1:26:47] child of God they've proven and they and

[1:27:30] tablet and I thought how insignificant
[1:27:33] is this why is he doing it but Lord you
[1:27:36] knew he wanted us to be ready in this
[1:27:38] end time that we couldn't be found with
[1:27:41] a spot we couldn't be found with a Reco
[1:27:43] we had to be found virtuous and pure and
[1:27:46] holy and we had to be found full of the
[1:27:48] fruit of the spirit so that we can
[1:27:50] conduct ourselves so that you could put
[1:27:52] your ring on our finger say this is my
