hallelujah praise the lord thank you lord we love you jesus amen what a privilege it is to be in the house of the lord this morning certainly appreciate god's grace to us you can be seated for just a little bit if you'd like i've got the little girl with the big voice of me this morning finally and i want to invite my wife to come by the way she said she did know left from right we figured that out after having a conversation on it amen come on up here i was laughing i said how do you know she said this is left and the other one is right amen i i was teasing them the other night samantha you heard me telling this about women not left from right i was using you as the example and i got in trouble with them by the way hallelujah but we we appreciate the lord today and um before we get into singing i i want to do one thing real quickly and this is just a real real fast thing i just want to mention to you real quickly um i i'm as it stands there's about a 90 chance and i hope this ain't like a weather forecaster you know they always talk about rain or something coming but as it stands i think i'm going to be able to get out of the country and get to the congo in july the brother that i'm working with over there and the pastor that i'm working with in lexington kentucky so far we got all the flights and everything arranged i just have to secure the ticket and we're gone so i i mentioned to you i guess it was last year some of the time about trying to get there we weren't able to make it we had all kinds of hindrances kova didn't hit after that but it looks like because i've had all my shots and all those kind of things like that i got that immunization card i can get in and out without any problems so please please please if you would please pray for me that i can make that thing happen because we've been trying now what um three years i guess we've been talking i've been telling you about it that's my cat about three years i guess trying to get there and i mean to tell you we've had every hindrance in the world trying to get to that place but if you folks will help us pray and uh and trust the lord we'll be able to get there and out safely and all that kind of thing and i don't worry about things like covet and all that i don't worry about stuff like that because believe me when i tell you no matter what you read on the in the paper or here on the news there's a whole lot worse things over in them countries than kovalev and mosquitoes are way more dangerous than cove had ever thought about being and uh so we uh we just trust the lord that god will help us do it and then uh let me mention one more thing to you real quickly and that is that um come as far as i guess maybe like august ish somewhere around there i'm supposed to do a couple virtual conventions with some folks uh down going into mexico central america and into the upper part of south america when i say south america i mean like some of them countries like venezuela guyana uh down through some of the parts of chile and they're supposed to organize this convention to my understanding as a virtual thing in many different churches down through those countries and they're going to connect it through an interlock through an internet streaming service of some sort and they're telling us that it's going to be somewhere around 15 000 people going to be connected on that thing around the world down through like that and they've invited me to be the keynote speaker of that so um you know i'm as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs anyways much less to preach over the internet to people know their situations and all that so please if you would pray for us on that wise that the lord would help us that way and if you wasn't here the other wednesday night when i was given that testimony when i was here a few a couple weeks back uh my eyes have been healed i'm i'm just a hundred percent on the mend and the holy spirit has moved for me and i want

turn back to matthew chapter 5 this morning thank you you musical amen i enjoyed that enjoying all this music and i enjoyed that organ playing i can hear you over there hey man i enjoyed that i'm an organ buff too you know that was my first instrument and i i love it i enjoy it amen good playing everybody matthew five let me begin with verse one and uh pick up one two and three and uh i was with you here the other week and uh thank you sir i started on this about about blessed are they and uh i told the lord now we had actually this weekend arranged before the other wednesday come in and i told the lord i said well you know i hate to as an evangelist try to pick up extra things and tag on you know but i just couldn't get away from this this morning somehow seemed like the lord said just go right back into that and pick up a little bit and i'm going to do my best not to insult nobody this morning okay at least not not that way amen matthew 5 verse 1. i want to pick it up on poor in spirit poor in spirit blessed are they but i will use this on the poor in spirit this morning and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain when he was set his disciples came to him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven now let me just read to you the meaning of poor in spirit what it actually means poor in spirit means to be humble humility is the realization that all of your gifts and blessings come from the grace of god to have poverty of spirit means to be completely empty and open to the word of god and when we are an empty cup and devoid of pride we are humble when we are empty cup and devoid of pride we are humble and the meaning of the word poor in the greek means one who has nothing and is completely empty let's pray together over the word lord jesus we so thank you this morning for the opportunity to come together to worship you in spirit and in song and everything that has been accomplished thus far in this service we are eternally grateful to you for those things i pray that you'll come down this morning that you'll take your word and that you'll speak to us law that you'll anoint my mouth to say only that which you'd be pleased with close my mouth to anything lord that i might not maybe should say then lord jesus as we stand here in divine presence father i pray the holy spirit will bless your word today as we receive it in the name of jesus christ and then lord i just want to ask for your favor this morning lord upon all of our believing sons and daughters of god that won't be just maybe here in the service but they might stream the service by the way of the internet lord may you go out through those airwaves and those channels lord and may you bless all that receive it there as well father may the invisible audience be just as edified as the one in the visible and help us now lord to be edified together as we commit ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you this morning you may be seated i want to i want to remember something and try my best not to forget it um uh brother steve laster wrote me and asked if i would have the church pray uh over his knee at some point we'll do that at the end of the service maybe and he just shot me a text this morning and said would you ask him to pray so i i he said it to me i probably said to somebody else too but anyways i told him i'd be happy to do it and then when he heard that i had the service this morning he'd asked if we'd make sure we pray so we'll do that at the end i want to wait till the anointing comes on before we pray for sick and things like that but we we love the lord and appreciate the lord and appreciate god's word don't you appreciate the word and let me tell you something friends the bible is our answer sure is and if we want to know a question or we want to know how to solve anything in our life the bible's got all of the answers that we need to get ourselves in the right condition amen not only to get ready for the rapture but to take care of things on a daily basis every day of our lives we have areas that the holy spirit amen will maybe deal with this on a minor level and then there are major things that god deals with on a major level it don't matter if it's minor middle major the bible has the answer for thing we have need of today and i believe that when the scripture was recorded i believe that it was a man's hand that might have took a pen and wrote it down but the bible said that it was the holy spirit that moved on man to give us the words of the lord that we have right here today and i believe that god has watched over his word and has protected his word and i believe that every word of it is valuable to us for our edification and are getting ready to go home with the lord jesus christ i believe that and i don't believe that the bible says things just in a in a haphazard manner and i don't think that the scripture uses terminologies that are necessarily the same as what we would say and i think sometimes when we read the bible if we're not careful we'll try to think of expressions and think of wordings and what more in the way we say them or the way we express them when bible meanings can be completely different from that and let me give you an example i mean use the word uh mature or perfect which should say the word perfect in our mind perfect means flawless and just without any kind of errors or any kind of mistakes or any of those kind of things but really bible perfection or the meaning of the word perfection in the bible simply means maturity or coming to a place where you understand how to handle all of the imperfections of life and the imperfection of walking so we would use the word perfect we say well that is perfect we think no mistakes no flaws those kind of things but really when you're looking at it scripturally speaking perfect in that manner is not the same and perfect in the bible way of it now the same meaning goes to the word poor when we think of the word poor in our mind we might consider that poor might mean without money uh being destitute not even being able to har together two nicholas's express goes to be able to buy a hamburger or a coke or a pepsi cold as my mom always said and those kind of things is our idea of what poor means but when you're speaking of poor in terms of jesus saying blessed are the poor in spirit he's not referring to wealth he's not referring to someone's economic status meaning what kind of a class they fit into whether they're lower or poor middle class of some sort but poor in spirit holds a different expression or a different meaning biblically than what it does for us here in ladies in our meaning and our understanding of poor we would think of somebody that didn't hardly have nothing couldn't pay their light bill those kind of things but poor according to the scripture as jesus used it here the very word that jesus used simply means to be empty and and and to be a vessel that has been emptied out now i want you to listen to this what brother brahman says in perfect strength by perfect weakness and i quoted this to you a couple weeks ago but let me refresh your mind if you don't mind when brethren says here that god's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them he said now just a little bit we'll go he said but like pentecost at pentecost he said what did he do he said it took him 10 days to get them all emptied up but they were all standing there with their vessels turned up and god took himself and filled them up he said that's all they shook the world he poured himself into them he poured himself into them he said that's the need of today notice that that's what we need today is empty vessels sir so god can fill them up he said i've got to bypass a lot here god cannot use them as long as they're already filled up if they're full of theological training god can't use you god's got to have an empty vessel so that he can fill them so god then had a strategy in taking a man or a woman and emptying them so completely that he could fill that vessel with himself now i want you to look at the very terminology that that joel was led to use remember what i said the bible doesn't just say things for the sake of saying it but look at the very terminology that joel used whenever he began his prophecy that he said in the last days i god will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and here jesus and all of the types in the bible are leading up to god is looking for earthen vessels that he can fill with baptism of the holy ghost i mean even look at that word fill with the holy ghost if we are going to be filled with the holy ghost then we must be an empty vessel that the holy spirit now amen can be filled up with the holy ghost if you are a full vessel full of the things of the world full of your ideas full of attitudes full of creeds full of this that and the other the holy spirit has no inlet into your heart that's why it is extremely and i mean vitally important for you and i to spend our days the day that we are not filling up it should be days spent emptying out you see a christian has an in-goal and an outgo and two of the most important jobs a christian has in this world is to spend all the time emptying out from everything contrary to the word and then spending the rest of that time i basically just summed up 2 000 years of christian history in a few phrases amen and really at the end of the day that's pretty much what it boils down to and you realize a person that has their own ideas their own fear about things they have their own ideas about maybe the word of god or their own ideas about family their own ideas about church even do you understand that a pastor has an important job because he has people that comes into a sanctuary and they sit there with him two three times a week every how long they might meet this role his main role in responsibility is to go in there and preach to the people in a manner that he can empty them out and then turn around and preach in a way he can fill them up and you want to talk about a hard job it takes a man special built and called of god to put up with a bunch of stubborn hard-headed egotistical mean rude and arrogant people i know i preach that none of y'all here but i'm just talking about in general that don't want to be emptied out and almost get offended at you and not almost they do get offended at you if you dare to ask them to be different because people come with their own preconceived ideas come on you can say amen they come with their own thoughts of how they believe that the world should run and their own thoughts i believe christianity what it looks like and all that and it becomes the minister's lot to try to convince them that what they're thinking is wrong how do they do that the first thing you've got to do is you've got to get that individual convinced that they need to let go of the way they think sometimes a pastor or a preacher in general but especially pastors has to come into a congregation and just swing into that bunch with everything he's got because he's got to be hard enough and rude enough sometimes to shake folks lose from things that they hold on to because let's face facts we don't let go of our thoughts very easily what we we take comfort in and what we think is our norm and our status quo and how we live our life we don't want to let that go and especially we don't want the holy spirit to come in and start rattling us unraveling our cage and trying to make us different from what we have always known but brother sister listen to me in 2000 years of the church going even back into the old testament god has never dealt with a group of people but what first he didn't shake them to their very core and shake their ideas and shake their thoughts and turn upside down every belief they've ever had in everything they've ever been taught remember what brother brown even said about isaiah that it leaned so heavily on the arm of uzziah that whenever god took uzziah away amen isaiah was so distraught he didn't know what to do with himself this is the whole reason he went into the temple to pray in the first place because he was seeking god what do i do now this was my mentor this was the man i followed and there he's laying dead what do i do now you see god has a way of shaking a man that he wants to use or a woman that he wants to put in his head from every influence that'll dissuade him and hear isaiah and the temple sing the very holy spirit the angels of the lord and things around and look at this man he's in such a state of mind that when the holy ghost visits him right there in that vision when he's looking at them angels of the lord he said i am a man of unclean lips i wonder if isaiah would have been a little bit different before uzziah went maybe he would have had a little bit more idea maybe he was one of the elite of the message of that day you know we get that mentality too that we are the elite of the world and we don't need to be shook and we don't need to be dealt with them we don't need to be preached to get a lot of eye blinks but not enough amens come on now and you realize this is the reason why the holy ghost sometimes rattle our cages and shake us loose from everything this is one reason diseases come do you realize that when you're praying for somebody you need to be very careful about using your holy ghost or a gift of the lord to call that demon off that person's life you don't know but what the holy ghost didn't place it there because they've been disobedient and haven't been listening and demonology the prophet taught us that god will use it as a whip if you've been disobedient god will use sickness as a whip to rattle you shake you get you woke up to pay attention about who's really in charge amen remember what he said about look up your redemption draw now that can be done on your back the same as your feet god knows how to put you in a position where you'll look up well you'll focus on what needs to be focused on especially if you're his child hey don't kid yourself if you're his boy or his girl he will turn your world upside down if that means getting you empty and believe me when i tell you friends our biggest problem around the ranks of this mess is the greatest problem we've got we've got too many folks that are full they're too filled up on this to fill up on that you might as well say man they're filled up on all kinds of things that's why the word has no place in them because they're so full of everything they've heard all the things that can be possibly said and you start preaching on the covenant of the lord you preach on the holy ghost you preach on it they're sitting in their own mind going i know that yeah i know that i've heard that for years i don't you're too full if you ever empty upright there's never been a sermon on calvary i've ever heard preach that i ever felt like i've heard it already but you get too full and all of a sudden that comes oh well i don't mean it's like a person that's been starving to death you invite them to a seven course banquet they sit down and they eat and they eat and they eat and they are stuffed to their y'all say gizzard over here we do in tennessee anyways they are so full they couldn't eat another bite and then you try to offer them a beautiful pumpkin pie or a spiced apple thing or some kind of a deal like that and they don't they don't they're not interested in any why they're full oh if that is the condition of the reason people just sit in church and look like a bunch of monkeys looking at a banana they are so full they don't have any enthusiasm they're so full of things this is what jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled you cannot be hungry if you're too filled up on things let me give you an example of what that looks like you spend your time listening at all the problems going around the ranks of this message okay maybe on the websites or maybe you're talking to somebody or some kind of a fellowship or something and every time you have a discussion it's about all the problems you realize after a few weeks of that you start getting filled up with those ideas and those thoughts and then every time you go to church or every person you talk to you start trying to scan and discern i wonder if they're like that thing i heard the other day i wonder if that church is like this one i heard about that you you see what's happened it's gonna be hard for you to have love and to be able to cover a multitude of sins because you've filled yourself up on a bunch of nonsense and that's all your mind has entertained and your mind is filled up on that glory to god well i said i wasn't going to insult you but maybe i'm there already now you realize the holy spirit doesn't want us to live our lives in such a manner this is the reason why that now listen i'm not i'm not silly i realize that people are going to have the latest of technology people are going to have facebook they're going to have twitter they're going to have instagram they're going to communicate through twitch and all these other i realize that and no matter preachers gonna stop us they're not gonna do any different no matter how many times we tell them from the pulpit don't do it the first car that comes along with bluetooth they're gonna buy it come on somebody i realize it i'm not silly i'm not one that i think we should be living in the prehistoric era and walking around with a club in our hand you know and stalking like the caveman trying to find supper that night i realize god has given the first hunter in here that tells me that facebook is of the devil and i look at your lately davis rifle you need to check your spirit because if you've got laser sights and all those uppity do things you've got all the same kind of technology that facebook has got so if you're going to be against technology be against all of it not just parts that you don't like where'd that come from well come on somebody but you see the mentality of the world is we we got to have this and we got to have that we're going to connect to that and then get connected there we're going to network here yes that's fine if you'll not get filled up on it but people will sometimes spend hours what they call trolling now we used to call it scrolling now they call it trolling and just going through one thing on facebook or twitter or instagram just one thing after another after another after another do you realize if people would have simply shut the news off and shut their phones off and never done anything during the pandemic but read their bible do you realize this nation we'd be ready for the coming of the lord right now because as much fear was invested into the people the reason you could not communicate to them that there was a way out of this mess and yet here we are now with the cdc releasing two days ago that if you're fully vaccinated you no longer have to wear a mask you can re-enter life and go to church and start fellowshiping with your family i'm so glad they told me ah but you see this is the idea is so much people are so filled up on so many things violence this is the reason why that we would preach against video games not that the video game itself is wrong but you take some child sitting there shooting a gun and shooting aliens and shooting zombies and all these other kind of things they spend hours doing it they're filling themselves up on the idea of what it's like to kill like a young person playing super mario brothers like i was when i was a kid i'm not throwing you in hell over donkey kong but some of the trash they got out there today is called a video game you spend hours trying to kill a zombie or kill a monster or some kind of effect that don't understand what you're doing to your spirit you're filling it up with all kinds of things and then when you come to church you don't have any more room and then you wonder why preachers part on you it's easy i see you come to church to the eyes of the holy spirit that there's not one more place in your baggage car to put another box in there and so what do i do by the discernment of the holy ghost i may not even realize i'm doing it but by the word i go in there and throw up on the door and i start throwing stuff out and kicking boxes over and and then you leave church called he looked right at me when he said that don't you blame the preacher's own fault that you got filled up on trash praise the lord cause that's what the bible said if he is a minister to your good and your works are good he will preach good to you but if your works are evil he said be afraid be very afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain [Music] so if you want a preacher to preach in the high realm of god up here where angels are floating you better live there i'll tell you because if not he'll get in the gutter with you because any preacher ain't afraid to get in the muck if that's where you are to try to preach the truth to you and tell you how to get out of that mess thank god for men like that i said thank god for men that aren't afraid to get their hands dirty that's that's that's if i had one criticism of ministers in this 21st century it seems to be the preachers are scared to death to get their hands dirty now it affects their paycheck they go get a job then if that's all this matters to you if all this all this preaching thing is to some guys it's just a matter of an income or retirement then mcdonald's is higher and so is taco bell pizza hut i saw walmart's got to open it for greeters down in manchester if you need one preaching ain't got nothing to do with what you make or how much money you make the holy ghost leads us to get our hands dirty to deal with the people whether they cut us off hate us dislike us or whatever they might do and any man of god is worth his weight and salt he will preach whether it offends people or whether it don't offend him come on somebody preached to me tonight yes sir he's not afraid he bears the sword not in vain he bears that word because if a soldier of the lord comes into these into these ranks and he sees the holy spirit sees that they're filled up on all kinds of things why do you think the prophet of god said kick out your newspaper to apply the token now let's be honest you're looking at me i'm looking at you i don't kick out newspapers i don't bring them any but if i'm sitting at a coffee shop and i'm reading a newspaper i don't feel like i've lost the token but the point that brother branham was making to us even when it comes down to something as simple as television was that people will allow themselves to fill up on that and they have no room for the holy spirit don't forget the very same prophet of god we like to throw them quotes around about television was a television walter himself don't think that's the sound of the pen dropping sure go back and listen to some of these things brother bam talks about when he said he'd be in a motel room and he hear oral roberts was preaching and he'd catch the telecast or the times he would sit down and watch gunsmoke and bonanza from time to time well nobody quotes them quotes do they you know why i couldn't above our legalist idea because we that stuff is holiness that ain't got nothing to do with holiness amen some of you that have the amish and the men like background you can know you can live ever so holy make your own clothes and grow your own foods and everything else and be just as dirty as the devil is the blood of christ is what makes us clean i feel like preaching this morning and not all works that makes us that way and also not the idea of oh if you see people sitting in a restaurant a television in the corner and you'll see brothers and sisters they'll cut them eyes and then we won't feel so condemned over such things that is a normal natural thing it is a normal thing if i'm sitting in a mall and i see the same thing on the mall that i see on television i probably cut my eyes over what in the world's going on that's human curiosity but the thing that sends people to hell is when they drag it into the house and they sit for hours doing nothing but streaming their netflix and their prime and their and their should have got a bigger amen than that they're filled up they're getting so filled up they have no time for the word of god they're getting so filled up ain't got time for nothing the bible or nothing and then they get so filled up on things and get so filled up on entertainment that when it comes time for church then because they've seen so much entertainment on their youtube and they've seen so much entertainment on other streaming services and other things like that that when they come to church the preacher's just not entertaining enough i see already i'm gonna have to preach without you if you don't get with me i'm coming on anyways huh this is the reason why it's so dangerous to allow yourself to get into habitual things of an everyday pattern watching this and then watching that and then you'll add 12 and then you'll add 14 and then before you know it you're binging when's the last time we finished the word of god i want to ask you a question evening light listen to brother ben when is the last time any of you binged your bible when's the last time any of you binged on the holy spirit in prayer when's the last time some of you binge on listening to tapes and listen to the prophet's voice but we're so easy to bend some new series or some new television show but when it comes to the holy ghost we're not interested in binging on that god let me become an alcoholic a spiritual one let me get so addicted to jesus christ and his word amen that is all that's on my mind day and night but empty that is the poor in spirit jesus referred to is those that are empty all right listen to this again in investments brother man said jesus said in matthew 5 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven we don't want to take that place he says that rattled place that way a place of being poor that away place of being poor in spirit that rutted place he called it we don't want that we want somebody to praise us and be a big somebody we don't want the rut we're interested in being noticed and if any of you sit right here this morning and try to pretend to me like you don't want to be noticed i'm calling your bluff and calling you a liar right now because i'm telling you the same as i'm telling myself all of us want attention all of us want to be noticed and all of us want somebody to love us and notice that we're on this earth and feel like we've made a difference in their lives come on preach to me so let's not start this whole idea or that holy message elite attitude not me i don't i don't need such things as that just be honest in the house of the lord because god knows you're lying anyways amen [Applause] we want somebody to love on us somebody to notice our efforts but listen if we are going to be the right kind of children of god and i'm not putting you down or making fun of you when i make that remark that i'm saying we are all in the same boat that's my point and if i took this congregation out of here and took another one in from arkansas put them out and put another one in here from missouri every person we had preached to brother tom would be saying the same thing we all want to be paid attention to there's something in human nature that craves for somebody just to notice us and don't sit and think that that always means the main spotlight sometimes it's minor things for example you take somebody that's introverted in their nature you know what i mean by introverted they're kind of an internal you know everything's on the inside my oldest daughter's that way she's like my dad a spitting image of my dad i told her the other day i said my dad will never die as long as you're a sucking wind she's a spitting image of the man she's sick in her body when she started going through all those problems with her gallbladder and she was so sick and had that pancreatitis hit her and she was hurting so badly if the kid made a whimper i'd have been surprised she was hurting so bad so miserable and i'd say how you doing and just like my dad four days before he went to his grave i asked my dad how you doing yeah all right no you're not you're not all right you're dying but that introverted nature ah they go speak out but that doesn't make them different because they don't always get in your face and crave the attention sometimes those are the very people that are just begging for somebody to just ask them how they're feeling you know the extroverted type people those are the ones that get all the attention of course because all squeaky wheels get oil or at least that's expression anyway you have this population of people that are absolutely they they they're inside their whole world there's an empire of stuff a metropolis of stuff going on on the inside but you never know it but they're built just the same as you are why do you think some of these very people were referring to are the very ones that end up committing suicide doing heinous acts and crime and all kinds of things and then some guy come on the television or someone on a news broadcast or you'll catch it on a we never even dreamed that this guy would be like this yeah that's right but you see inside all of us we lack that something that was passed to us from the fall we lack that something that makes us crave after somebody's attention don't you recognize where that come from that is man being separated from god and what he really wants is god's attention hallelujah and so because we're the type of people humanity i mean that we kind of look for attention in some way if god would only show himself with skin on it how many times have you prayed that the lord would do some fantastic thing in front of your eyes just so he would pay attention to you and yet the very thing that we can do to get his attention is the very thing we don't do and that's get completely empty so he can fill us i've said this for the last few months holy spirit give me something i've been sharing with people all around the country thus far i want to share with you this morning it's this very simple thing sometimes people get it in their mind that in order to be right with god his attention i mean that they've got to be sinful they got to live like the devil they got to do all kinds of meanness and horrible this that and the other in order to get god's attention so he'll really come down on him to show his love but do you realize brother brown preaches one message one time he says this he cares do you care you know what he said in that message if you want to get god's attention just simply show the lord you care showing that you are concerned about his word showing that you are concerned about the truth come on somebody huh somebody help me showing that you're interested in the people of god that you're interested in the holy spirit and the more interest you show the more interest he'll show we don't have to live like the devil to get his attention the fact of the reason that many of us never overcome certain battles in our life if we'll be honest about it is because we really are so stubborn we just don't want to let go of things listen i'm battling things right now i battle my weight i battle a lot of that if i'm really being honest about my weight if i'm being honest about my present health i just think been serious enough about this old heart of mine or these kidneys or that pancreas i've been serious enough about these things i've taken it just a little bit easy because why just like everybody else we settle into this little rut and our run is a whole lot different than his rut because brother and said we don't want to take the rutted place well that pla that rut is a whole lot deeper than the rut we're in this is completely empty in spirit notice again he says i love this he said you know we don't have to be so poor in money we have to get poor in spirit so for you that might be thinking that this just simply means not having any money remember being rich is not a sin i understand why many of you ain't holiday man because you're in the same place i'm in silver and gold have i none [Laughter] right but being poor in spirit doesn't mean you have come empty meaning that you don't place your own thoughts in the way of the holy ghost you realize even some of you businessmen in here don't run your business by what you think run your business according to your leadership of the holy spirit if the holy ghost tells you don't take that deal then you better not use your brain to take it if the holy ghost tells you not to buy a house or not to buy a car or not to do this you know that thing you better obey them things let's go and see way on down the road you're only looking at present tense he sees past present and future he knows where a lot of those business deals were conceived at what their background and foundation is and then when they present it to you it may look so good you think man you'd be stupid to pass this up but god knows where it was born that's the reason god told him to go into ai and tell everything including the babies too because god knew the background of those children would come right up underneath that heathen regime and they would come right up to hate israel and destroy liver the same later and they'd end up going by the sport anyways because god intended to wipe them all off the face of the earth did you tell me he didn't the holy ghost got very very very very disturbed at saul when saul went down there and spared king ag god wanted to wipe the whole bunch out so he knew there he knew their past and he knows their future and he knows what they're all about so before i make any kind of a decision before i do anything at all i wait for that little voice to speak to me yeah this is the way that's right you know when i first started preaching full time may i just a moment when i started preaching full-time when i moved to tennessee the holy ghost told me to come to tennessee i said okay finally i struggled kicked far you've heard my testimony on this before i told the lord but listen when the lord started opening doors for me to preach i was i marveled at the preachers that would tell me don't preach for that one don't preach for that one don't preach for that one don't go down there don't you'll ruin your ministry do you know that during a global pandemic when the majority of evangelists were having to go get jobs because the food on the table do you know i continued preaching three times every weekend and do you know that i could have been preaching every single weekend do you know why not because i'm big shot i'm a bragger because i took all them little churches and preachers told me not to i was in them places that were socially distanced way before they had associations [Laughter] the point i'm trying to make to you is that if we follow the holy ghost god knows the ends and the outs of every bit of it if he knows that wouldn't he know marriage let me understand who you're supposed to marry who you're not supposed to marry oh you said what's that got to do with anything same reason brother brandon said before you marry a boy or a girl you better check their family check their background she may be pretty now but look at mama look at daddy those jeans don't fall far from the tree amen and if mama ain't one of these type of women their feet is never a boat in her house and she don't her children don't raise up early to praise her i don't care what she may look like you better be careful boy or a girl on the other side for that matter let's take the other side too he might be at work he might have all kinds of money i've had sisters come to me i need to marry this man he's got a house he's got a job he's got a business he's successful yes and you know what ended up happening because they didn't obey the holy spirit they married a workaholic and then they were set at home like a slave with no affection no attention no love just some man would come home and put a put a big paycheck in the bank just to turn around go to his office and get right back on the phone not a family man a workaholic you know there's as many workaholics in this message as there used to be alcoholics because people have gotten such a trend of making big money in big houses and big this that the other and they have forgotten where our background was oh he did not come to message a bunch of rich people we came humble poured out emptied out so the holy spirit could fill us up but now we've gotten comfortable all right again in church age brother and said the people of god are not material minded anybody want to stop and have an honor call to repent a little while because look how easy it is to become material minded i mean brother we're living in a day where i mean everything is touch and and and wireless and listen i come up generation x right i'm a 77 baby all right if you would have told me that i can perform 90 of everything i need to do on this little device right here i would have thought you were from star trek or some kind of a star wars or some of the futuristic things out in the future somewhere i would have carried on beam me up scotty [Laughter] i never dreamed the first cell phone i owned i was 18 years old i went into a radio shack that is special a bunch of pennies on the floor said pick up a penny take a phone home i did but i didn't realize that phone still cost me 985 dollars a month and it was as big as this speaker right here and i had a trucker's antenna on top of that little old chevy spectrum of mine 85 chevy spectrum i was i was such a big guy even back then not fat but big and i put that little car on one arm at a time and i would go through mcdonald's and this gigantic antenna sticking right up on top of it what's that it's my cell phone where'd that come from just look in the back seat is sitting on the back row but why why do we why do we follow such what they call trends because it's an easy thing for us to reach out into this ladies and age to try to satisfy what we think will make us the most comfortable in life yeah and really it's a cultural thing more than anything else because i've been to those countries and some of you have to i'm sure if you've traveled but when you go under them places they live without even the idea of electricity in the home i mean okay let me put you this way first time i went overseas and i asked them where the bathroom was and they pointed to that little old shed over there in the corner i wasn't they didn't that didn't rattle me too bad simply because my granny was a granny you know what i'm talking about she was a tennessee granny i understood what our house was years ago i understood what it meant to live a country life years ago i might have been born in ohio but believe me there's a whole lot more rebel running through these veins than ever was buckeye as i was raised on grits and maters tomatoes and when i walked out there in that outhouse the outhouse didn't bother me but when i saw what i had to do in order to use the facility i said dorothy we are not in kansas anymore and i'd sit there on that little that little plastic chair was with my little spot where i supposed to sit where i preach and i watch people go in and out in and out and out in and out and it didn't seem like it bothered them at all now for you and i we would die we'd have brad would have to use his medical training to come and resuscitate us from heart failure because we would absolutely just we would almost collapse which is the whole reason why some preachers don't become missionaries anymore i heard god tell me one just here about three four years ago we were sitting in this real fancy place up there and he said oh i just couldn't mention it like that it's just so hard for me to sit on a plane like that for so long i thought bless your little heart i'll get your bob on your blankie for night night time we're not willing to sacrifice what it takes to be empty so god can use us oh lord i don't know where all of this come from rest assured folks this is brand new hot off the press so you're getting it i'm getting it just first hand the same as you're getting it right notice this again i love this he said they're not material minded they're christ-minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above it's absolutely the truth the majority of christians are not wealthy that should put us in the bible right now there's any quotes you could say amen to that ought to be the one right the majority of christians are not wealthy listen oh i love it he said rather there on the poor side it was so in jesus day true in paul's day and it should be true today but it's not too true for the ladies and age which is one of vast wealth where often the criteria listen the criteria meaning that in order for you to be eligible to be spiritual listen that message folks you better listen to brother ben real carefully on this because i've got a warning from the holy spirit i'm going to share with you in a moment the criterion of spirituality is the abundance of earthly goods if that doesn't speak and testify of where we are right now i don't know what quote does because there are some people in this message that don't even think you have a spiritual pastor if he's not if money ain't rolling out of his ears some people would never attend camp meetings that were not well financed and air conditioned or heated depending on the time of year here i come anyways you say what how's that going to benefit us here in elkton kentucky oh you think the devil needs a passport to get down here to you you reckon the devil stops at the border up here when he comes from tennessee to kentucky that he can't affect your mind that's the reason i'm preaching this folks we have been affected by what we believe is spiritual based on how wealthy and how what we call blessed it is some of my bedrock preaching when i first started evangelism i went to a little place out in the middle of goshen georgia and when i got there it was this little old country church had no air conditioning there was rolls in the floor from where the place was just about falling down around my ears and i got out there to preach and made one jump up and down and heard and i went to the other side of the platform and while i was preaching a dog come right in the middle of the aisle and sat right down there in that aisle and listen to me preach he was more attentive than the people were actually and then the chickens were going outside the door and they were right up in the middle i'm not talking about a foreign country i'm not about georgia well i guess that's up for debate but that's boring so some of them folks i know up north that would be foreign for some of them and you know what friends i don't say this is a bragging way i just mean this with humility and just just to make a point i felt just as home and just as at home as if i'd have been in the wealthiest palace that there would have been because when you're not material minded you're looking for the holy spirit this is what i love about my lord jesus i love this about him so much i've watched him come into big churches that are well financed and they've got all of the sheetrock and the plaster just right and the trim jobs are perfect every corner put together just exactly and brother joe i've watched him come down into little old dirty places that were like cesspools amen where people had used a bathroom not more than 10 foot from where we were standing and the stink was broken through the church amen but the holy ghost come right down and that suspect as same as he did that big church i love that about my lord is he's not material minded he does not look at what your clothes you're wearing whether he can come fill you with the holy ghost or not and abide in your heart this is why some people have to understand you must understand this god is not basing his feeling on whether you've got a certain look on the outside or so much money in the bank account he's not looking at how well dressed the vessel is hallelujah right but the criterion that he's looking for is just be empty it really don't get any more difficult than that just be empty now friend i don't have to come down here and start beating on you and driving at you about what that means your own conscience declares to you what it means you know the areas of your life that you allow to be a little rambunctious in maybe a little overtaking maybe a little bit too strenuous of an activity or some kind of a thing that takes up all of your time and when i say strenuous i mean it takes effort for some people to sit there three and four hours looking at a computer how many times have you heard this remark let me just use this to kind of back up what i mean people can sit down and move within and watch a movie for two hours but they can't sit in church for 30 minutes how many times you're done that's the reason we can't sit in church anymore like that because we've filled up so much on other things praise god my how rich the church is in goods but how poor in spirit blessed be the poor for yours is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is not meat and drink it is not material glory to god it is within us a rich man is rich in god not in worldly things let me give an example what i mean by this matthew chapter 12 verse 43 and 44. jesus refers back to how when a spirit would leave a man and watch he said when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walks through dry places seeking rest he findeth them then he says i will return to my house into my house from whence i came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished so the very idea that backs up this thought of empty is that even after a spirit has departed from a home a house you your body your soul your spirit it leaves it empty this is the state that if a man would remain that way then it would only be a matter of time before god would make his entrance into that very heart that's been emptied down but you see patience is a difficult thing for us because in this age of push button everything we want it to happen right now and maybe god knows that there's areas of your life that he wants to wait and see if you're willing to be empty for a while let me tell you something if receiving the holy ghost meant that i had to stay in a sanctified position for 25 years like we preached abraham a couple weeks ago if i had to stay sanctified for 25 years if that's what it meant to remain empty just to prove to god that i was willing to do so i'd fight with everything i had in me to remain empty you say brother ben that's ridiculous is it so ridiculous what do you all reckon that the foolish virgins are going to receive eternal life because of because these are sanctified people that remain empty all the way up to the last state this is why jesus can put a white robe on him because when they take their last breath on this earth those foolish virgins as he referred to don't have any devils hiding in them they have remained empty and they determined in their heart i'll never let nothing fill that space but the holy ghost i'll tell you something people come to a preacher they go to somebody they got confidence in and they want them to instantly fix their problems and these things are not fixed instantly god sometimes will base all of your deliverance on your determination and how willing you are to fight all right brother brandon said just the other day going up the road on the way to indiana and he said fight till all of the symptoms are gone like that but what if i have symptoms ten years i'll bless your heart you want me to get you a bottle too all right are you willing to be a rugged christian are you willing just to give up you're willing to get the deliverance you want or you want them just to throw on a towel and quit don't forget brother sister the person that screamed top of their lungs i can't do it i'm giving up you are looking at a face of god and you are telling god with your attitude i do not believe what you said in your word that i can do all things through christ which strengthens me you're just as guilty as the big braggart walking around i can do it all you're just as dirty all right because a real man or woman that's following christ they don't use such things as an excuse because you already realize in the beginning you're a failure in the beginning you can't do nothing in the beginning but this is the attitude of a real son of god a real daughter of god lord i'll do whatever it takes to stay empty until you can occupy me with delivering power i had several people telling me here about a month ago almost in succession nearly one one one brother told me he was quite an older man and he said i just keep doing the same thing over and over again what do i do i said the same thing that you need to keep doing which is to keep fighting keep repenting keep living right and keep doing the thing that you need to do to stay empty until god can bring you the deliverance you need here's where people mess up they give up at that point they reach that spot and they feel like well i might as well quit god's not even paying attention how do you know that art thou god oh man stand up and give me an answer he said to job [Music] in other words you don't know what five seconds is going gonna hold for your life you don't know five nanoseconds much less the next 50 years of your life how dare we we take into our hands the very attitude that if god don't answer on my terms and he ain't gonna answer at all shame on us i said shame on us we ought to be willing to say god no matter how long it takes if i fail a million times a day if i fall on my face a million times a day i believe your grace is bigger than my failure i believe your grace is bigger than my mistakes i believe your mercy and your love and your blood reaches farther down for me than anything else hallelujah and because i believe that i refuse to quit how's expression go winners never quit and quitters never win we've got to have that iron disposition about us to say you know what i may not be the best christian i may not be the top of the game i may not be the best in the country i may not be the one that god looks at and says you are the greatest i might be that quote i might be where brother brenham said the weakest of christians that might be me fine if i've got a struggle for everything i've got to struggle at the end of the day i'm still a christian at the end of the day i'm still going to get something out of god even if it's the crumbs from the master staple the lord showed me something preaching the other day that blessed me so much you know when the stephanie woman come and he said you're a dog put her down remember all that you know that's a racial slur do you know that did you know to call somebody a dog like that is to call them a racial slur that was a hybrid group of people that the dog was spoke of as the lowest thing on the planet and he so insulted her that humanly speaking she had a right to say forget it then but you know what she did now jesus put her in that rutted place she went even a step lower than that if you look at the original translation of this scripture she didn't say the dogs eat from the master's table the original translation sent the scofield bible as well if you'd like get a school field but in the original translation she said but the little dogs she didn't even make herself an adult dog she made herself even lower than that but even the little dogs no wonder jesus looked at her and said woman i haven't found faith like this in all of israel blessed are the poor in spirit a little bit further thank you it's going to anyways i just thought i'd be polite and ask and luke chapter 1 46-53 and i'm just going to kind of cover these you don't have to turn unless you want to but i'm going to move pretty fast so if you want to write them down it'll be good too luke 1 46 and then verse 53 and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord listen he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent empty away not so much the rich in money but those that had no need of nothing remember the very testament of laocia was we have need of god help us message people listen to my trumpet this morning blowing we have arrived with the same attitude among our people we've got to where we've heard it all we've read it all we've been preached to about all of it and when we come to the house of god we're so full that we don't want to hear anymore god empty me out lord and help me empty out until you can fill me with your presence proverbs chapter 16 19 better it is to be of humble spirit with the lowly then divide the spoil with the proud so proverbs 29 23 and a man's pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit empty in spirit remember humility is not the act of humility you get this fake stuff with people sometimes you know when they say boy i enjoyed that song just an old spare tire now if you don't mean that from your heart you're putting that on if you don't really feel that way about yourself you're putting that on better to just say be gracious and say thank you appreciate that then to put on some kind of a fake act that everybody can see you are a fake is a three dollar bill humble is not about walking around i've seen people in my years coming up they clutch their bible everywhere they go and they never laugh that's one of the first signs of being a sinner you know is laughing a lot sir it is with some people if you want to laugh or have humor or joke or any kind of a thing like that god they think you're sinning for sure and whatever you do don't be joyous don't do it because if you're going to be humble humble means to be miserable but happy in the lord don't laugh they think this is humility and every time they open their mouth amen amen that's not humility humility is the simple act of being empty so god can fill you it's really that simple praise god matthew 18 verse 4 whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child i did this with you many years ago but you ain't a little boy no more you take that baby sitting back here by the middle of the robe all them disciples i'm the greatest i'm the greatest i jesus took that little boy coming put him in front and said whoever comes like this that'll be the greatest among you you see what jesus is talking about a child doesn't have any preconceived notions they haven't been taught anything about race they haven't been taught anything about hatred they haven't been been programmed with a lot of those kind of things because you will watch a white child play with a black yellow red just the same as they would any other child and they don't even think about the color of the skin that's one example of many things i could be talking about jesus said become like that empty matthew 23 12 and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a beast so the way up is down the way down is up see what i mean what we talk about in the bible our definitions of the bible is not the same definitions as what we look at because any gps on my phone will tell you up is this way if i tried to go that way is it recalculating recalculating recalculating and i'm not supposed to go you understand if i go a direction i'm not supposed to go that thing will squall at me until i either shut her up or or go the direction i'm supposed to well you see that's what the bible does we start getting a lot of pride and a lot of things going listen that little voice inside of you going recalculating recalculating recalculating yeah because the way up is down whoever obeys himself i like the example brother potter used a number of years ago and i could take books maybe i'll just show it if you take a stack of books like this you could throw something at those books and knock every one of them down except for the bottom one because the one on the bottom is already down it'll have to be knocked anywhere a christian that stays in that position all the time they are the ones that god blesses with so much things that people don't know nothing about let me hurry james chapter 4 verse 6 and then verse 10 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud and giveth grace unto the humble humble your their yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up so what does that mean to be humbled in the sight of the lord does that mean when you come to church you know you're you're pious you walk very gently very quietly and when you say praise the lord you're careful praise the lord do you understand somebody of total humility could see somebody passed out drunk rolling on the floor slobbering on the side of their mouth speaking of tongue that's not our idea of humility but uh maybe that's the reason we don't see enough of that around the message and i do say enough and i meant what i said and i said what a minute we don't see enough of that around the message because we've gotten so filled up with our ways to levitate god almost absolute miraculous heaven-sent revival some odd strange thing to even get us in such a state of worship why because we're too full if we ever get empty that's the kind of worship you can expect to come out of your life the kind of worship where if i'm looking down through walmart i remember brother batman said have wisdom about things don't be cutting obviously the holy spirit could be cutting you up on a street quarter form full of people he said but you use wisdom and if i'm walking through walmart or some lowe's or something place and i have many times and the holy ghost was working on me dealing man i feel so blessed i look around i see ain't nobody around i start going thank you jesus tears running out of my eyes somebody come around the corner well that's not being ashamed of friends just use some wisdom but i could be so blessed why if you're empty that's what he can do for you so the answer to your question is how do i feel that be empty you need to probably spend a lot of time emptying yourself before you start asking for a blessing all right remember when you come to this platform asking the preacher to bless you that's what we do when we pray over you and we ask that god heal your body you leave the platform with the blessing of our prayers that is a blessing to you lay hands on the sick they shall recover the prayer of faith shall save the sick that's a blessing and i don't mean to imply that's just preachers i could be down at your sister's house or somebody full of the holy ghost but you leave after prayer with the blessing of that prayer on your life before you ask for that blessing how much time do me and you do we spend just saying okay god i need to empty out my feeling about this because i really want you to heal my body but i've got a lot of doubts that's going to happen but no see see we don't want to go to them rutted places like that we want to pretend like everything is okay nothing to see here move along rather than get down bare knuckle honest with ourself what's wrong with admitting you know what i've got a lot of doubt actually you know what i believe that's one reason why the lord healed my eyes like he did because when i was standing out in that yard after getting that first diagnosis and i was standing out there i looked at the lord and i said god i don't believe you can heal this diabetes in my body and then i told him it's not that i don't believe you're a healer but for all of the reasons that i feel like i've battled weight my whole life i've always been good and bad friends i'm not a lazy person at some point in my life i'm probably gonna die from overworking but honestly i stood there in new york and i said lord it's not that i don't believe you're a healer i just don't believe you're gonna heal me and i had a list of reasons why i just felt like he could not perform this miracle in my life and you don't understand maybe if you're not a preacher but being a preacher complicates it even more so because there's elements to your call that you realize that those gifts are not for you they're for the people and because you're built in a way that you want to see the people bless not yourself have a hard time believing for me one of the most difficult things i can ever do actually is to believe god can do something for me i am just as amazed it is profound to me that the lord did what he did because i honestly couldn't believe it would happen for me and when i stood there and i told him lord i'm just going to tell you i just don't believe it can happen for me but i'm taking all of that all of my feeling and i'm letting you know i'm in a such desperation that i know if you don't move for me i'm in trouble what happened i just simply reached the spot where i could empty myself out then he could do what he did if we don't come to that place of desperation friend we'll never empty out like we need to don't look at your trials and things you've gone through as being a bad thing god might be trying to shake your cherry tree down huh he might be rattling your cage for a reason oh my yeah that's right lord jesus i know that if i had the ability to read minds and hear thoughts i know there is a metropolis of activity going on this place right now but you see that's exactly the point i'm making your minds right now are running 400 miles in every direction and listen don't tell me i've been preaching in 30 years i know they'll look on that face i've seen that around the world but this is the point i'm trying to teach you this morning you need to stop that right now stop and take all of that activity and stop and say lord all of that i'm giving that to you now all of them thoughts all of that confusion all of those questions i'm yielding that up to you and emptying that out don't you see the answer is not for me to go another hour and work out all of your thinking that is not the answer to your problem the answer and that's where the devil gets you hung up because this thought will go that way and it'll connect with that thought and give birth to 10 more what do i do about this and oh i felt that way that and all of that activity you know what it's doing to you is keeping you full so if you want to really get to the place where god can bless you right here this morning right now now take all of that thoughts all of that activity and just push it up to him say lord i'm giving all of that to you and then be honest with yourself and just admit i don't know the answer i don't know the way out of it but i'm emptying out so you can fill me up one more scripture let's pray first peter five and five likewise younger submit yourself to the elder yea all of you be subject subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resists the proud and giveth grace to the humble how many of you want grace what better way what better avenue for god to send grace to your doorstep than through the avenue of humility did you know brother brandon said one of the first things god first things that god gives to you when you receive the holy ghost is humility humility asparagus musicians god bless you but i want you to stay seated for a moment this kind of sermon goes for all of us and if you go to your service and you go to your duty right away you're going to miss your opportunity to pray as well i'll call you in just a moment but hold still for just a minute now friends with your head's bound and your heart's open at this point in the service there is not a preacher in this world that can do for you what you can do for yourself right now by simply telling the lord god as i said here with my head bowed my heart open i'm asking you to take all of my confusions and experiences and thoughts and thanking i'm giving all of that to you right now and lord i'm emptying myself out so you can fill me up with yourself remember be determined while you pray that if god doesn't fill you immediately understand that he is testing your character and your feeling toward him and his word and you also say these words in your heart and lord while i sit here in your presence yielding my thoughts my thanking my motives my objectives everything to you i am also telling you lord i am determined to stay empty for as long as it takes add that to your prayers well don't forget that part is important i'm emptying but i'm also determined to stay empty lord god my hands are up to you this morning jesus lord i'm not a possessor of everything i preached this morning i need it to other elements of my life and elements of my walk with you where i fall so short little thoughts and things and thankings and trainings and stuff that just creeps its old ugly head back up lord those things that just can't seem to squash them somehow but lamb of god no matter what kind of battles or trials or things we've got to go through this is what they call cutting to the chase where lord we go right to the heart of the matter this is the heart of the matter and if by your spirit we can empty our hearts today in our minds and our thinking and motives and objectives and those things the lord i know beyond the shadow of a doubt you can perform exactly what you promised in your word which is to fill us with grace to fill us with joy there's so many things coming in this supernatural atmosphere with the angel of the lord here in the word of the ministry and no doubt the angels of god in this building right now and the holy spirit here and feeling all of this supernatural around me lord it's just little things just keep coming it's like popcorn now like those rocket ships brother i'm telling them roman candles things are bursting all around me i start thinking different thoughts lord such as a person with depression maybe the reason they can't be filled with joy and peace is because they've allowed their thoughts of depression to crowd out that real thing of joy lord you take a person that just arrogant all the time and all the time brother talked about that as being a complex lord where their thoughts dwell and what they feed on and how they think and what they do and how they react and mannerisms and all of that it just becomes stuff that fills us up or we can't the holy spirit has no way in so lord if there's ever been anything i've ever preached that i believe could be as beneficial to the people of god as anything it's this message right here this morning that you've given us because lord jesus i see the answer to many of our problems laying in these words blessed are the poor in the spirit because your prophet would go on to tell us in the book of romans that the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but joy and peace in the holy ghost so lord it goes to prove to us that if we're full if we're too full then you cannot fill us with your pl with your presence it's not that you won't it's not that you can't it's just lord we have to be in a position to be able to receive it help your people this morning lord as many of them lord as i've looked at across the audience while praying here just to kind of gauge where what might be going on to see lord what you might be doing i see dears and i as i see hands raised up and different people praying saying different things and our mouths are moving and lord jesus i have no doubt that they're in the same place i am they know their lives they know where they're at and they know they need your help and so father this kind of sermon that motivates us and challenges us to look inwardly and as humans we feel so helpless but god let us take that feeling of helplessness let us yield that to you as well could be completely empty help your children this morning reach that spot that they can be filled up with what they need and lord if there be a purpose in making us wait then lord fill us or at least grant to us the determination the resiliency and maybe in a manner of speaking a stubbornness almost i don't know how to say lord but not necessarily an evil type stubborn way but just a just grit i guess that if we've got to stay empty for 100 years whatever it takes i'd rather die an empty christian than one filled up with the world or at least a potentially empty christian help us lord i pray in jesus name amen hallelujah hallelujah now friends you may not know what to do right now let me instruct you the holy ghost has heard your prayers he's heard your heart what you need to do right now is you need to take time to thank him give him praise for what he's done so right there what you're saying just raise your hands up say lord i want to take this moment to thank you thank you for speaking to me thank you for moving on me thank you for anointing your servant today lord to speak these things thank you god for letting the songs fall on the right orders lord even the songs we sang led right up to these moments father the song service and everything was just perfect lord jesus we want to thank you today for using your word in such a manner thank you lord for hearing my prayer and as i walk out of here an empty vessel lord i'm putting my steak down thank you so much lord thank you so much for speaking to me hallelujah now just tell him with your mouth i believe you lord just speak your faith out i'm trusting you jesus i'm receiving it today god i'm receiving it lord i'm believing that i'll walk out of here different than i've ever been before because the holy spirit has shown us the way so now we just have to continue thanking him and walk that same way every day this is the kind of sermon when you wake up tomorrow you do the same thing tomorrow that you're doing right now just lord jesus i'm emptying all my thoughts emptying all of my mind i'm empty and all of that all those feelings of this or that i'm just giving it all to you lord i'm asking you to fill me now fill me lord thank you for filling me thank you for blessing me thank you for encouraging me thank you for helping me praise be to god you may not believe it but great things are happening right now i'm telling you that great things have already transpired you say great ain't nobody shouting or nobody rolling in the floor hey the sun got up this morning and drew millions of gallons of water up into the atmosphere and we never even heard it don't think that great things are always noisy things sometimes god moves in silence hallelujah thank you lord all right musicians come if you will let's sing before we go praise the lord stand with me if you will i've never preached anything in my life that was inspired that was it i'm standing outstanding here amazed this morning by the time with the words of the lord [Music] it's absolutely perfect just everything perfect i'm telling brother sister whenever god wants to visit us in his word like that i don't take it lightly when he talks to us like that i don't take it lightly because when he's got those kind of things to say to us i say lord help me because you know when it comes powerful like that sometimes that means it's the turning of a corner you know don't forget that when the seals was getting ready to be opened they broke the sound barrier first then they had their picture taken next it was the turning of a corner closing out of the gentile age as far as pentecost and those people go and now opening up the way for the bride of jesus christ to find her position it all turned that corner great things powerful things were happening all at once when the lord speaks to people the way i've saw him speak this morning and heard him speak this morning that means great things are in a store for us it's just business people hallelujah and you get that out of your mind that i'm thinking that about me i'm talking about him i'm talking about his word i'm just an old lump of clay being used to say things and ain't got nothing to do with me believe me because if you're under conviction so am i y'all think you're going to go home and pray some i'm going to be right down on my face with you because i heard things this morning that i know that i've fallen short and that i know i need to make happen in my life but thank you lord for speaking hallelujah thank you lord let's sing together get in my mind i got to change gears [Laughter] um forgive me mercy rewrote my life that's what i'm trying to get out of my mouth i'm so glad there's been a new book wrote [Music] mercy [Music] [Music] god's mercy really [Music] i should have fallen in my soul [Music] can we sing it again with our cup turned up this time oh mercy re-roll my life your mercy it re-rolled my life i'm so glad about i should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy [Music] hallelujah well [Music] did this help you [Music] how many is going to take this for probably the next month or so waking up of a morning and going oh god help me lord help me lord listen buddy it ain't gonna be an easy thing because don't forget the devil been listening y'all and he'd been watching he sees your commitment he sees the dedication and the thing you said to the lord this morning it reads your heart or your thoughts or nothing but if you even said lord help me he sees all that he said listen be smart be wise not mentally intelligent but be spiritually intelligent tomorrow and the next day and maybe a month from now or a week from now watch for those little attacks that's going to come trying to fill you back in just don't let him do it just don't let him do it every time something comes in there root it right out right away get a shovel spade take your bare hands and dig that thing out i said lord no no i'm determined i'm gonna stay empty god bless you friends i love you i'm gonna go pray now god bless you [Music] i enjoyed the message this morning amen [Music] amen amen i can just imagine the holy spirit i can just imagine jesus trying to tell us that he just would like a little more room in our life amen he knows how busy we are you know even our schedule is really full isn't it we have a really full schedule sometimes we won't even hardly sing the last song some of us got to go we're so busy our schedule is so full amen instead of maybe just basking in the presence of the lord a little bit longer and amen and worshiping them a little bit more fellowshipping with one another i mean that's the way it is with him we have definitely have full schedule our minds full everything like a brother said amen we have to make room for him i mean he wants to just do that to god i want to make more room for you lord amen amen praise god god is good isn't he that's just power heads precious and kind heavenly father we come before you lord and after hearing a service like this morning lord sometimes we go home lord and father as you've spoke to me many times and we go home and we do the same things again and nothing ever really changes but i believe your spirit is telling us you know we have to go home and we have to say we want to do something different we have to do a different one what we've done it before lord we've got to make more time for you lord more time for prayer lord get rid of our self lord not be so busy with everything else lord jesus make room for you for the things that we think is a blessing to us isn't always it's only the time that we spend with you father and [Music] the avenues and opening the doors of our heart to you that truly the blessing of joy the blessing of peace the blessing of allowing you to lead our lives father we just ask god that you'd help us in this coming week now lord to take it to our hearts the thing that we've heard you say lord jesus to know that father one of the hardest things in the rougher things there is lord is when we empty out lord if you don't come and just feel that lord jesus it's not a great place to be lord jesus but we want to be faithful until it's your time until you come and you do something in our lives and change us lord jesus we ask your blessing upon every soul here this morning lord all of our hearts are open and in our hearts we're saying lord i surrender all we want to surrender everything to you lord afresh we've gotten away from the basics lord jesus and that is just simply being completely surrendered to you lord jesus no matter what we have to do or what our schedule is like father you are first in our schedule and everything we do lord we ask for your continued leadership and guidance in everybody's life lord draw us all closer to you father as we see this world and watch this world crumble and fall lord we reach up to the kingdom that shall never be shaken and lord jesus that will endure forever god bless every soul now this morning in the name of jesus christ amen and amen praise the lord amen let's sing i want more of jesus more and more and more amen as you dismiss [Music] i want more of jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus than i've ever had before [Music] i want more of his great loves to full so origin and free i wanna jesus so i'll give him more of me i want more of jesus more
