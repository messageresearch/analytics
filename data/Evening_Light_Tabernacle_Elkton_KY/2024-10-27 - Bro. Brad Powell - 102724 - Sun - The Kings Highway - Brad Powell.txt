done we just come to glorify your name and to praise you for what you do in our daily lives bless the service now in Jesus name and everybody said one more thing everybody repeat after me I was glad I was glad when they said when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord amen give him a hand say thank you Lord Jesus [Applause] amen if we'll just go in the Psalms this morning we're going to go to Psalms 36 children can be dismissed for Sunday school y Psalms 36 the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of God before his eyes the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he has left off to be wise and to do good thy mercy oh Lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds how excellent is thy loving kindness oh God therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings for with thee is the Fountain of Life and in thy light shall we see light let not the foot of Pride come against me and let not the hand of the wicked remove me there are the workers of iniquity Fallen they are cast down and shall not be able to rise God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters if you would turn with me sorry about that to the 13th chapter of Matthew I was going to say something funny but I I'll let it slip about those first few verses there in that in that chapter of Psalms there that 36th chapter um so I've talked to brother Thomas last Sunday morning and I've uh there was some other costs that came through the church and I just for the rest of the winter we're at a point where uh other than the normal expenses which would be you know like cleaning supplies and you know the fellowship dimmer we're we're at a point where we have to hold so if you have something that you're you want the church to do it have make sure it goes through the trustees and then brother Thomas is the final approval for any of it the expenses for the church and the reason I bring that up is because uh after settling all the debts and I just want to be honest if some of the people who had since August until now hadn't used some of their own money we we're at about $5,600 in the general fund we would probably be probably down in the threes or the low fours right now if they hadn't done that so just remember if if it's any major expense it has to go through the trustees and brother Thomas is the final approval for that so if make sure if you have an expense that brother make sure you let me know that that expense has gone through the trustee board and brother Thomas and right now on the general fund uh is $5,600 that's where around $5,600 and I do keep a cash account I do carry a little cash with me to pay for those little bills so we don't write checks out of the uh out of the general fund but I was uh re last night listening to a message and um as I came to this 13th chapter here uh I'm going to start at the 37th verse and I was and you'll see where I'm going and I might be a few reading a few verses here but in starting at the 37th he talks about the psalm of talks about the parable not the psalm of the sewer and the seed and I'll just read starting the 37th verse and he answered and said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man and the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one so you even see here there's two seeds a good seed and a bad seed and the enemy that sow them is the devil and the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world and we're com to that point now and the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall get gather out of his kingdom all things that offend them which do iniquity and that you could go back to the 36th Psalm we just read the first four or five verses deal with that here too and shall cast them into the furnace of fire and there shall be welling in nashion of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who ha hear ears to hear let him here and that's where we're at this morning I hope you all have a listening ear to the word of God this morning and he goes on to say and again the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a treasure which is hid in a field that which when a man hath found it he hid it and for Joy therefore goeth and sth all that he hath and buth the field and again the Kingdom of Heaven is like onto a merchant so I was thinking of these these two Parables here and the kingdom of heaven is like onto a merchant man seeking Godly pearls whose when he has found one pearl of great pride went and sold all he had and bought it and then he goes on as he finishes this here and the kingdom of heaven is like onto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind and which when it was full they drew to the shore and set down and gathered The Good Into The Vessel and cast the bad away and that's the same for us when you when you interreact with people out there in the world it's not you that pick the good out of the bad it's God that picks the good out of the bad all you're responsible for is to tell the people the truth and so shall it be at the end of the world and the angel shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just you know all the years I've learned one simple lesson you can't make people do good you can present the truth to them you can lead them but they have to be willing to follow and if they won't follow you just got to be nice to him and just be kind to him and let God work it out in the end and so shall shall it be at the end of the world when the Angels shall sh forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire and there shall be a Welling and nashing of teeth and at this 52nd verse Jesus ask his disciples after all these Parables and all the revelation of these Parables he sets them aside and he teaches them what really The Parables mean in the 51st verse really speaks to me this morning he goes and Jesus said on to them have you understood all these things that I've said unto they said unto him yay Lord so we we know that did they really understand everything that Jesus was telling them they probably didn't understand it completely until the day of Pentecost and but this 52nd verse really stuck with me this morning it kind of jumps right out of there and and it goes back to what I was thinking I was thinking this morning as I was reading in in uh first Kings about you know the life of Solomon this morning and he goes back to this Merchant that bought that field or the businessman that sold everything to possess that one Pearl and I was thinking of Solomon's life he started good God gave him everything and at the end he veered off at the end and I I kind of think about myself as I get older we don't want to be that way we we want to be consistent and we want to have more at the end than we did at the beginning you if you get it all at the beginning and you don't hold on to it until the end what good is it for you how's it going to prosper you and I was thinking of this 52nd verse here and it said then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven so he's talking about the Scribe this is someone who studies the word of God sees the word of God for for what it is and he goes on to say instructed in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man that is a householder which bringeth forth out of his treasures things new and old and that's the way I am this morning there's things that God taught me 40 years ago and there's things that God's teaching me today the Christian Life or the Christian experience you just don't get you just don't stop growing you just don't stop you have to keep adding daily to your experience in Jesus Christ this morning the experience I had when I was a 25y old isn't the experience I need now as a 65y old but God knows what we each need every day and you have to seek after it so God shows you what you need to be and I was thinking I I was sometimes when I sit down and read about Solomon and all the examples in the Bible people that didn't finish well I don't want to be like that as a 65 year old man myself I want to finish well I want to hold to what God has shown on me and I want to gain more as the my as this comes to an end and I was just wrote some I don't want to take a lot of time I'll get started and won't stop but I was thinking of some examples in the Bible where people added had the old and added to the new and the the prime example that spoke to me going through all the scriptures I'll just jump to it I hope I marked the right spot was in Timothy second Timothy the 4th chapter I was thinking of Paul's life here's a man that added new the old to the new Paul being a s Pharisee had a deep knowledge of the law and of the prophets but he took that law of the prophets and added the revelation of Jesus Christ to it so he had both the Old and the new and I I was thinking of that this morning in this fourth chapter I'll read a I won't read this I'll apolog I promise not to read this whole chapter and I charge thee this is what Paul said to Timothy I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead as appearing in his kingdom so he's given Timothy the younger man some knowledge here this morning preach the word and be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine and a lot of times we forget that word there longsuffering but but he goes on to say for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and that's where we're at this morning people don't want to hear the truth anymore they'd rather have someone tell them a lie and be content in their life than to hear the truth and it's really it's really bad but that's the way it is they'd rather have someone lie to them so they can have an easy life and just keep going down the road without any and then another example and I I'll sit down after this this example I was thinking in I I mentioned this a lot Peter uh the Apostle Peter was the same way he had something old and he had something new at the end and uh I'll start at about the 11th verse well let me I'll just start at the 10th verse here and let God's word speak for itself but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with a fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that sorry about that that's second Peter the 3r chapter the 10th verse also and the work therein shall be burned up seeing that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of a person ought you be in all holy conversation and godliness and we can say the same thing this morning Peter had the revelation of the word of God for his hour and we had have the same thing this morning and when you see the things going on out there in the world this morning and the years ever since all those things that are going on you're we're at that same place here this morning it goes on to 13 not reread the same verses nevertheless according to his promise look for the new the heavens and a new Earth where in dwelleth righteousness but I'm going back to what Peter says later down in this chapter wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things to be diligent you may be found in them in peace without spot blameless so it really strikes me a lot the Christian life is not a life of worrying or fretting or string over the things that are happening but it's a life live in peace and longsuffering because you know that you know that God has done it for you and he goes on to say here but I was thinking Peter had both he he he walked with Jesus he was a disciple of Jesus he was taught the law as a child and yet he acknowledges Paul the messenger in later on he acknowledges Paul I'm going to reread the same thing but starting at the 15th verse and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given him onto hath written onto you so we're no different we have that Revelation this morning in the message of the hour and he goes will be no different also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to understand which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures onto their own destruction and he goes on to say here yet ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware least you also and that we're no different this morning ourselves being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness and goes back to what I was saying earlier I was thinking Solomon's not the only you can go through the Bible numerous examples of people that started well but finished bad or people that what's funny some of the people started bad but finished really well but we want to be that person that starts right and finishes well and I'll just finish therefore beloved seeing you know these things before least you being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stead fness but grow in Grace in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be the glory both now and forever amen so I I wrote some other notes not wanting to take a lot of time but I was just thinking of what Jesus said there stands alone itself I don't want to make a mess here but I want to be able to possess as the householder both possess the new and the old and also at the same time hold on to that Pearl that you're you know every one of us has been asking Our Lives to sacrifice the old man to take on the new man and that's like selling everything you have that businessman sold everything he had to possess that one Pearl he didn't care what his state would be at the end all he cared about was possessing that Pearl and it's the same with us no matter what happens if if you've received the Holy Ghost and the message of the hour and the Revelation no matter what happens out there in the world you're going to do everything you can to hold on to that one Pearl this morning uh brother Josh amen let's stand this morning anden let's just Worship the Lord can we sing that little chorus I'm

you what I the singing back there just just got me uh got me uh ready to go so that's what it's about thank you brother Josh for pacing the atmosphere so we just want to continue to carry that on and have church and we're not going to put any limitations on God this morning we're just going to let God have his way you know a lot of times I think we come to church and and I've been guilty my family's been guilty and if you're honest you'll ra you could raise your hands and say we limit we limit God we put constraints on God when we say uh I've got an appointment after church I got to go to dinner I got if I know the preacher is going to go till about 12:30 and man if I can Fellowship for about 10 minutes and then I can get to Clarksville by 1:15 we can we can get there I found out the best policy is just don't plan anything because when we plan things we put a constraint on God and basically what we're saying whether we like to believe it or not is is God I'm going to give you an hour and a half and then my time is so important I need to go feed my belly I need to go take a nap I need to go watch a football game well no limitations if we want to see God move in the way that we desire no limitations turn with me if you would as you're turning uh to first Thessalonians and 2 Corinthians I'm going to get into a little thought this morning and we'll see the direction it takes us and I tell you I started this and I thought well this is is going to be one phenomenal service and the more I looked at it I thought man this is going to be 20 or 30 services and because it could go so many different directions and so I going to look at a thought as you earmark those two tabs 1 Thessalonians and 2 Corinthians but I'm going to look at a thought this morning the King's Highway thankful to have my parents here with me this morning and and uh so they's able to come and we appreciate that and our visitors a different ones so but I want to read this to you the prophet said no matter how hard it comes how many knows we're in hard times no matter how hard it comes no matter what it looks like what anybody says I want to with patience listen now I want to with patience not fretting he said a person can't have patience and be fretting all the time but you just got to set yourselves straight right there and walk right on no matter what takes place move right on because you see storms are going to come troubles are going to come hardships are going to come hurts are going to come disappointments will come but you set yourself and you move right on you see brothers and sisters God expects those who travel on this way to live a life of Holiness he expects that life of Holiness he expects us if we're going to have that glorious privilege to commune and to fellowship with God it's going to take a Holiness a holy way of living and that Holy way of living is a way of life and it don't matter what comes our way it don't matter the tra the challenges the struggles the disappointments those things things don't matter those are emotions those are emotions of a situation that you're going through it doesn't change how you live for God and so we're looking at this and and I want to speak this morning on the King's Highway and this would I guess we would say it could be part one of the King's Highway but the bride of Christ will walk so close in his way and he'll represent him so well because they're walking a different Road than the rest of the world first Thessalonians let's read 4 and seven two simple scriptures for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness Holiness it didn't say uh it didn't say he called us unto worry or unto fear or unto uh depression no he called us unto Holiness the rest our emotions so no matter what you go through you may have some fear you may have this but it don't stop the way you serve God second Corinthians 6 and 17 say Amen when you got it got it wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord you may have your seats and the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word this morning so we look at these two scriptures here and and looking at these and I got to thinking about them and you know I thought this these scriptures aren't something that we we should do or that God just asked us to do but this is something that we must do this is something that God requires these scriptures and all scriptures for that matter when we take this word and we begin to dig into this word and look into it these are not just mere suggestions this is a way of life this is the road that we follow this is the map that we follow and by following this map is the only way you're going to get to the destination that you're longing for you see we have to have a direction in life we we make decisions we go down roads we take a path we do this we do that where we go to school where we who we who we hang out with the friends we have the the the the the the girls you date the boys you date who you'll marry all these things are decisions that begin to take place and it's lining up the direction that you're going in your life but see as Believers we've been given a GPS system that GPS system is God's provided sermons brother Steve we've been given God's provided sermons preached from 1940s to 1965 God's provided Service uh sermons and they were preached with pinpoint accuracy accuracy that no human could do accuracy that was only given by God himself you have to have that accuracy if you're going to arrive to your destination than you Lord one of these days in the moment in the twinkling of ah you're going to hear you've arrived you know I I went the other night I went the other night and was going to go and fellowship with brother Joe and and brother Joe Adams brother Aaron and brother Tommy they asked me and Weston to come and fellowship a little bit so I said you know that'd be nice I I think we'll do that so we head off down there to Central City and Greenville and I I text Brother Bor hey send me that address well don't get address from him he may take you spiritually where you where you want to go and show you that but don't think you're going to go to meet somebody 14600 us62 Highway all right I know where that's at I know roughly where that's at so we're driving along five miles you five and five miles take a right and three miles take a right and and one mile and 500 feet take a right I said Wesson there ain't no right to take I said we ain't got nothing but woods and walls a rock beside us so I said I'm texting Tommy he's a text guy he he'll know what to do I said Tommy send me a pen is that what I did what I do I said Tommy send me a pen Bing there it was right there on the map a big dot with a pen in the center this is where I'm going right here it said continue for half a mile and you'll get to where you're going continue a half a mile see we can't just be wandering around in this world we got to have a pen we got to have a destination that heaven is my home no matter what happens no matter what comes our way we're not just wandering God didn't make us to wander the country Countryside but he says travel the King's Highway you can't uh you can't expect to just live any way you want to in this world during through the week and then come and walk for God on Sunday I like I like what Zig Ziggler said y'all know I read that stuff I like what he said he said everyone knows what a hypocrite is that's the guy who gripes about the sex violence and nudity on his VCR some of you got it on his VCR but you see we're to be a separate people we're to be a separate people we belong to Christ and there ought to be a noticeable difference between the believer the the Born Again Holy Ghost filled Christian believer and the world that is walking in and out of churches in and out of Walmart we don't travel this way just because it's convenient no there's you know and that's where people

mansion for the Bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ but you see walk in the King's Highway Holiness it's Faith it's the king King's Highway you see this world is full of distractions it's full of distractions and and it's full of roadblocks it's full of detours and they'll set you back if you're not careful I tell you me and uh me and brother John went to to Johnson City Friday Thursday Friday we we headed off up there to deliver those generators we're heading up there man I said John watch that truck tractor and trailer just coming right over in front of us he said I I don't know what he's doing he's sleep or something distracted we go on down the road two or three times this happens I said man we these people going have to pay attention what they're doing and then all of a sudden John watch the breaks you know we're starting to Skid the the trailer tires what are these people stopping for he says I don't see nothing I don't either we get up there and it's a car broke down been sitting there look like for four days got an orange sticker in the window and everybody's done slowed down and looking at that distracted distracted these distractions are coming there and brothers and sisters we're living in the midst of end time prophecy we can't allow distractions to detour us off of our road because these distractions are going to come and they're going to slow you down they're going to try to hinder you but as Believers we have to keep our faith dependent on Jesus Christ now you watch what's fixing to happen in a few short days we are fixing to as a nation we're going to decide who will be the 47th president of our country oh I got your ears now and we're going to decide who that is and as patriotic as we are as Believers we know that that outcome has already been predetermined before the foundation of the world this outcome was already been predetermined by a higher power and we as Christians shouldn't put our faith in Donald Trump you sure shouldn't put it in well I got a little political forgive me but the truth is we don't we don't put our dependability in them because you can't depend on Donald Trump you can't depend on Camala Harris you can't depend on the Republicans you can't depend on the Democrats go ask the people in the Carolinas and in in Tennessee where's their government nowhere to be found they said they told us the other day it's just people coming together it's people from this community and that state and this state and that state and he kept naming state after state after State what was it they care about each other and here we see uh we we see that we're we see what the media calls the road to the White House are you with me we're on a road to heaven they're focused on a road to the White House so they're focused on this road to the White House and their focus has changed over time their agendas have changed over time because they will do whatever it takes to get into that white house because in that white house they have power in that white house they have authority and so they're going to do whatever it takes to get in there to be the president of the United States no matter what but brothers and sister sisters I'm not worried about the road to the White House I'm not worried at all about the road to the White House this morning I'm walking on another highway I'm focusing on a highway that goes far beyond what the White House can give me a highway that take me much much greater places than anything Donald Trump could ever give me this highway I'm talking about is a healing highway it's a highway that you can walk when you say Lord Lord I'm in despair Lord I'm hurting Lord I'm I'm stricken with the disease Heal Me Lord walk that highway it's a highway that that that you can go down through there and and it's a highway of Deliverance and freedom that you don't have to be bound to the things that hold you back it's a overcoming highway it's a highway of life it's a highway that was paved by the blood of Jesus Christ on the cross of calvary it's the any other highway I'm going to tell you is a highway of death Listen Now by winning this election whoever wins they're going to come the become the voice to the entire world you say where are you going with this you see they have influence they have influence to to make decisions and they have influence to to help other leaders make decisions around the world good bad or ugly that's the truth of it whether you like it or whether you don't decisions are going to be made in that white house that are going to bring end time prophecies to pass so why are we worried about an election so we shouldn't let the results of this election Shake us we shouldn't let the results discourages because either way I'm going to keep walking in faith I'm just going to keep walking no matter what comes my way no matter what the world sends at me I'm going to keep walking you say well you may have hard times Keep On Walking you may get sick not be able to go to the hospital I'm going to keep on walking because if he was a Healer then he's a Healer today I'm going to keep [Applause] walking you know the country is not the country it once was I heard my my my father here the other day my dad the other day he said I wish you could I wish you could know the country I knew that's right yeah he said I hate it for my grandkids this country he said will never be what it once was I wish I could you could live the country we liveing but let me tell you it's not going to be what it once was it's not coming back it's not based on the principles of which it was founded on her ethics her oral her morals the values that came from Hebrew and Christian scriptures that shaped this nation when it was incepted into the world as the United States of America no longer exist you know Philadelphia has what we call the Liberty Bell somebody somebody some of y'all probably seen it right the Liberty Bell raise your hand if you seen it y'all didn't see that that when y'all was up there we're all familiar with the Liberty Bell and when that Liberty Bell was was was was cast they put an inscription on that Liberty Bell and it says Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof that's Leviticus 25 1776 they took and they put the the very scripture out of Leviticus that was given during the time of a jubilee you look back in your Bible and read Leviticus 25 it's talking about the Jubilee year every 50 years there's a jubilee there's Freedom if you're you can go you can start your own way so they put that on the Liberty Bell but I want you to know this in 1798 John Adams gave this warning to the people and you listen to this our constitution was made only for a more moral and religious people listen now it is Holy inadequate to govern of any other did you hear what I said our constitution was made only for moral and religious people where's the country's morals where's our where's the people's morals at and it and he said it is Holy inadequate to the government of any other it can't govern those people the government cannot govern people without morals or religious background well y'all getting quiet on me but let me tell you this that's the way it is with us if we we begin to Veer and we begin to get off of that road and we begin to waver off of the the very foundation of the road we're standing on if we're not careful the word of God can no longer govern us do you realize that that's how important it is that you stay right with the word you stay moral you stay ethical you stay exactly with what that word says and under that you'll be governed by God Almighty I'm giving you some stats here to lay a foundation for what's to come fast forward 208 years Barack Obama June 28th 2006 I'll read it as just as he delivered it whatever we once were we are no longer a Christian Nation at least not just we are also a Jewish Nation a Muslim Nation a Buddhist Nation a Hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers a nation of [Music] nonbelievers let's go average countries this is just some stats for you your average country typically lasts 150 8 years Empires stick around for 250 so where does that place us this last July this past July our country turned 248 years old you say why are you bringing all this out I'm bringing all this out to prove to you that these politicians are in place for a reason things happen for a reason as Believers when we heard Barack Obama think about this I know many of you remember this in 2006 when Barack Obama made that statement and it angered us it made us angry as as Christians that the then president of the United States could say such a statement for the whole world to hear that that he could Proclaim we are no longer a Christian Nation and We're a nation of unbelievers how many of you did it make Angry come on church thank you sister Robin yeah if made us angry that he could say such as that and it and it angered us but it ought to not have angered us because all he was doing is it should have opened our eyes because he begins to speak prophecy he begins to speak what has happened and we look at this and and remember they have a voice for a reason they're walking a different Road their motives are different he was making a declaration of the direction we were going as a nation that's right and it made us mad because we're I don't want to say proud but maybe we are a little bit proud to be American Christians and we should be that God chose us over so many to live in this country and to and to be able to see and understand and to be chosen by God that ought that ought uh give us some some pride in the right sense but I want you to watch what's happening I'm going to I'm going to read to you a little bit so you stay awake okay snowballing it's a dynamic is being driven by the acceleration and switching among young Christians ages 15 to 29 people under 30 tend to Grapple with identities of all kinds you got men being women women being men women being cat C men being dogs I tell you what I seen something the other day I thought this can't be it's got to be a joke it was not a joke it came across on the screen there an adult litter box did you hear what I said you you know that's that's where a cat goes to use the bathroom an adult litter box in somebody's house a big old sandbox and she was demonstrating how she cleaned her litter box they grapple with identities of all kinds says but there is a second Dynamic that began in 1990s that added a new layer of change keep in in mind these dates starting in the mid 1990s it became more common for adults in middle age and Beyond to discard their Christian identity so in 1990 that's about 1990 let me get my dates right 1996 I got married and if I had not held on to my Christian identity and been like a many of the world who begin to leave the Christian identity what would what happened to those children when those families decided we're not a Christian family anymore and they begin to have Offspring you see where this is going listen now it gets more interesting 95 listen to this 95% or more of people who were born prior to 1940 so if you were born prior to 1940 and were raised Christian you were still Christian at the age of 65 they were solid they were solid there was things that went on in the early 1900s you had the Aus of meetings you had the the meetings that coming up and the Holy Ghost was moving across the country and people were solid in Christ they were solid in in the movement of God watch this though but among those that were born in the 40s 50s and 60s did you hear what dates I said the 40s 50s and 60s there has been a more substantial movement away from Christianity after the age of 30 so during the time when the prophet messenger stepped onto the scene and began to reveal the message of the hour 40s 50s or 60s there was a turn are you with me listen what he says notice in Revelations three he said when he come in the last day he prophesied he would come in the last day and how did he find the church Rich need of nothing set as a queen and he can he can see no sorrow the church he's talking about and they put him on the the outside of the church 40s 50s 60s up until then solid now that the revealed word has come they had no use for him they put him at without the camp and she didn't know that she was blind and naked and miserable she didn't know it but now we find him again in This Day 1964 the message going beyond the the camp now we find him again in this day as the Bible would say put outside the camp they don't want him they rejected him again he said with their counsels they would prefer prefer today like they did back then to put him on trial when the word is on trial what happened they rejected again and what they did they accepted barabus a murderer so in the 40s 50s and 60s they would rather have the spirit of a murderous Spirit over the revealed word of the hour and you wonder why there was such a fallen away because they chose barabus he said and today because listen today because they have rejected the word and the perfect Vindication of the hour they have sold out right this hurts our patriotic Soul they deny his word they deny his baptism they deny his power they deny his signs so everything that they saw everything they witnessed every Miracle every limb restored every eyeball be built this was witnessed eye to eye this is not some story people sit in the front pews and saw children's eyes be formed in the sockets of their head people sat on the front row and watched dead be raised people who were dead in the street in in the aisles and they were prayed for and they rose up they saw it with their own eyes they saw limbs of of of of children who had Polio to come back out straight and they Den Den that power they deny that power they deny that sence he said no they want Creeds so they're taking their Creeds above what God is doing in this hour so where does that take us where is that leading us I say that to say this stay focused stay focused on the on the word of the hour stay focused on what God is doing today don't look and want better tomorrow for America it's not coming you say man you're hard stay focused don't be deceived because what happens when you're deceive you get led into a sleepy mode and you begin to fail to realize what's even happening around you and all this stuff that you shouldn't be concerned with begins to concern you and you become such a political Advocate that you better be careful I have to to be careful because we do want what's best it'd be nice to have eggs at $2 again $3 a gallon of meal it'd be nice to be able to go buy a gallon of meal I've seen where somebody had their grocery bill that was $75 like so many years ago and they run the same bill again through the app at Walmart and it was $240 for the very same products now my my pocketbook tells me I want that but my but my my my highway that I'm on says look unto me there's a call that's going out stay focused 50 years ago 80% of us adults were Christian 2007 78% yeah 2001 63 % you know what brought this on I tell you what brought this message it was me I was I I got curious I thought I'm going to see how many Christians there are in the United States of America because based on the number of population there's no way Donald Trump can lose if there's 260 M billion or what million whatever the number is Christians well Lord have mercy he'll the country but we have to make sure those are Holy Ghost filled well so the population of Christianity begins to decline reaching 47% by mid-century and by and by 2070 should we T that long by 2070 37% from the 40s to 20 2070 a decline from 95% to 37% is expected you see Christians are fixing to be a minority if you think you under pressure now you see what I'm saying I can't you can't you cannot dispute prophecy you cannot dispute statistics you can't dispute what's happening in our country and he says now she must rot H he's talking about the country he's talking about the United States the country he says she must rot notice notice Brethren she's totally rotten her Politics the system is rotten it's just as rotten as it can be there isn't a sound bone in her in her World Systems in her politics in her religious uh politics whatever it is you say well I'm a Democrat I'm a republican I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist the whole thing is gotten to the core do you see why it's important you don't denominational IE anything do you see why that's so important that we don't make a denomination around the word of God but that we just simply live the word of God when somebody ask what do y'all believe we believe the word of God well what part all of it he says this thing is rotten to the entire core there's got to be something give way she can't stand this is the mind of Christ speaking are you with me listen to this you say man I I still think we got hope I still think we got Co hope and Donald [Music] Trump you could put a George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in every County in this United States and she still couldn't come back she is beyond Redemption amen there's only one thing that can help her and that's the coming of the Creator as we as we journey through here and we begin to walk I got to thinking how true that is as we're walking and we see the hands of our loving Savior and he's saying come my bride come my bride no more no more pressure no more toils no more troubles no more trials No More Tears no more sickness no no more heartache Jesus no more worrying where you're going to eat no more worrying where you're going to sleep no more worrying if you're going to have clothes no more worrying about all these things no more worrying about your children making the right decisions praise the Lord [Applause] listen to this brother the lids come off of Hell the streams of demon powers is pouring in from everywhere it's Conquering the Nations it's conquered politics it's rotten to the court it's conquered the churches until they know nothing but denominations what we need in this hour is faith we need faith that will produce the quickening power through through the Holy Ghost a faith that will produce the quickening changing power where God can come in and move on the scene and in the moment in the twinkling of an eye change takes place turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11 Carson if you can pull that up and we'll also go into Genesis if you if you're quick enough we'll see if you're quick on the finger quick draw back there Hebrews chapter 11 familiar scriptures we're very familiar with it now Faith now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by what the word of God the worlds just think about that all countries all all all citizens All Nations all continents were framed by the word of God so when they step away from the word of God what happens to their framework through faith we understand that the worlds are framed by the word of God so that things that are seen were not made by things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh now here's where I want to get to by faith Enoch was translated [Applause] that he should not see what death and was not found because God had translated him can you imagine on that day when they're walking around they're looking around they say where old Enoch go I don't know I've looked everywhere for him did you go look at the did you go look at the at the Undertaker did you go to the funeral home he ain't there where'd he go where did he go in the moment in the twinkling of an ey he was translated God translated him for before his translation he had this testimony oh we better read this we better read this he pleased God he pleased God but without faith it is impossible let me read you a quote real quick listen he said 'I going to say something faith is unconscious he said yeah amen you believe that yes he said I've learned it in the years of travel around the world and meeting the people of the different walks but faith is unconscious you say how are we going to make it how are we going to make it how how did Enoch make it how are we going to make it when we see destruction all around us let me finish the quote you got faith and don't even know it so when you're downhearted when you're broken heart and you're depressed and you think oh I don't even know how we can make it through this world with the destruction with the the things that are coming upon how am I going to do it you've got faith that you don't even know you got because he says without faith it is impossible to please him the word says for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek Him Genesis chapter 5 genesis chapter 5 now we're going to get into looking at Enoch here for just a few minutes because I sometimes I think we get in such a hurry that we don't take time to realize what's really happening and and the timelines of the Bible and how all this is lining up and Enoch and who he was and because in Genesis chapter 5 this is a chapter we all skip when we read our Bible this one begat this one begat this one begat this one begat this begat begat begat beat beat beat man is this thing on stuck as it burn hit the you know hit the the turntable beat beat beat beat but we can't miss what happens here Genesis 5:21 Enoch lived 6 and5 years and begat methusa and Enoch walked with God after he begat methusa 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so you mean this happened in Genesis this is written about all the way into yeah this is this is the way it works God don't change and methusa lived 187 years and begat lamech and methusa lived after he begat lamech 782 years and begat sons and daughter daughers all the days of Methuselah were 969 years and he died so here's where we got to get to thank you Carson so here's what he got to get to brothers and sisters Enoch walked with God Enoch stayed the course Enoch didn't deviate off the course at all he lived and walked and breathed and everything he done was walking up that King's Highway and he stayed right there you say well it wasn't the same as it was back then as it is today is so much harder was it was it because do do we realize do do we really realize because I didn't until I studied this out exactly what was going on during this time listen here the Bible tells us nothing about the early years of Enoch all that we know is by the age of 65 he became the father of a child which he named methusa right so and we're told that he walked with God for over 300 years but I want you to notice the name of this child methusa if I say methusa you think what he's older than methusa right that's what you think but let's look at what the name really means you want to know what time this was what time what what Enoch was going through what Enoch saw as a prophet listen what he saw the name methusa means when he is gone it will come what's he talking about what's he talking about he'll come what what what why did he name why did God lay it on his heart to name him methusa that when he is gone it will come well if you do the math and you go looking at all the days and the time that everything happened in methusa life when you get to looking at that you'll find out you do the math that the flood in Genesis chapter 6 and 8 came soon as mathusla died and you going to tell me they wasn't having bad times because I think there's a reason God destroyed the Earth with water and Enoch preached this through the through the very name of his son you see there's a reason that God puts these people in place and here he is he's telling them at the death of Enoch Enoch knew that the world was going to be destroyed back to Enoch Enoch's name means dedicated one I hope that's what my name means dedicated one and he lived up to that name because when we begin to look at the life of Enoch we see that for over 300 years on a daily basis day after day after day he pleased God he was a man that walked with God he was intimate with God he knew God God in him walked hand in hand side by side over and over than you Lord and he soared in God God began to pull him up to a higher place and nothing could separate him from God not money not business not possessions not pleasure there was not anything in the world he was never alone and without God 365 years nothing separated him because nothing separated him this enabled uh Eno to sort of heights that only we can imagine and dream Enoch was there his faith Ena him Enoch's life teaches us that how to walk with God in a fallen World God was fixing to destroy the world so we know that it was in bad shape but here's Enoch and Enoch he he lived a life that was so pleasing to God they walked side by side and he kept right there clung to the side of God now how many of us can say when we go through our daily walk our daily lives and right here clung to our side is God everywhere we go everything you do Michael John God is right there every single thing you do this man was incredible his passion his dedication his desire to serve God was beyond anything that we can imagine Flawless for 300 years I do good sometimes to make it through 30 minutes well I'm honest and Enoch walked with God and as he walked with God it didn't not just only draw him closer to Heaven as he walked towards the heavenlies he be to distance himself from the world you see what's happening the closer we start to get to the seeing seeing the bright lights as closer as we get to the last day we ought to just keep focusing more and more and more on what's ahead and start letting the world stay behind us put all the world and the draw and the filth behind us the prophet said he was an eagle for that day he had his eyes set on a Heavenly up above he was an eagle he had Eagle Vision now I want you to listen to this about Eagle Vision Enoch paid attention to the fine details he didn't want nothing to slip by sometimes we just we just look at the big stuff well they don't do this they don't do that but what are you doing what about your fine details how how tuned in is your vision he has an he was an eagle you know a eagle can spot a rabbit from three miles yeah there's a different kind of vision they have Eagles see things different you say well that's that's three miles I mean my goodness let me put that in perspective a mile is 5,280 feet so at 16,000 feet roughly they can see a rabbit let's break that on down a little bit more when you fly in an airplane you know when you start going up and you start seeing those cars disappear you're probably around 15 to 20,000 ft so from that range and they're soaring there and they're fly they're looking down there and they're seeing a rabbit Eagles can see farther and Beyond than anything there is Eagles can go far far far way more farther than than what well we can't Paul you help me oh yeah here we go come on come here D help me too yeah so you hold this right here here let's get down this aisle you hold this oh you're going to let him do the do the dirty work huh you got good Vision 2020 okay all right you stand right there hold it up right here two three come here we'll see if you got 2020 that's 10 feet 2020 you should be able to read that bottom line perfect perfect don't go nowhere 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 read me that bottom line I can what I can you you can't see that you you can't see that that that's it takes eag Vision yeah okay that's 25 205 Vision not 2020 205 so what you were reading up there at 10 ft that eagle can see that no problem sitting right here oh yeah do you see the difference we gotta we can't keep our eyes just just honed in on one little thing we gotta be able to look and be a to see beyond thank you thank you brother Paul we got to be able to see beyond what's happening around around us and look further to the spiritual and say God is moving something's happening God keep showing me show me more show me more show me [Applause] more he says I was talking to a dear brother sitting there the other day and he said one thing brother brandham was always shook me I said what is it brother he said it he said here is what you said and it's true the minority how a little group is going to be saved in the days of the coming and we talked of how Jesus straight As the gate and arrows away but few there will be that will find it you know some people are so narrow-minded they could see through a keyho with both eyes you got it they don't want to look beyond what they see in front of them and he says you know he say straight As the gate and narrow as the way he said but he said as it was in the days of Noah where eight Souls were saved by water so shall it be in the coming and he said and I said brother you just he said remember there's only eight Souls there he said you got half the picture he said Noah was a type of the remnant that was carried over not the translated Bunch I'm not going in an ark I'm going like a thought Enoch was translated right before the floods he was a Rapture he was a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ that was raptured before the flood hardships can come it's okay let the hardships come because it it's not going to get too hard for the Bride of Jesus Christ she's going to take a Rapture she's going to take a translation like Enoch he said there there was Enoch one day just walking along and all of a sudden a ladder just FL fell out of Heaven he just walked right on up the ladder we either Believe It Or we don't so no matter what we just got to keep walking keep walking Jesus Christ no matter he says if it was a storm and the Gale was knocking from the boat from both sides of the other he was standing in his face and a mess of demons at him if they were hanging everywhere he never moved he didn't fear the things of this world because why he's not of this world and what about the Bride of of Jesus Christ she's not of this world either so don't fear the things of this world he said it never mooved he walked right on just as calm and quiet as could be you ever seen people get all worked up and been out of shape over this the minutest of things I said man don't sweat the small stuff there bigger things that can happen we're still alive we still we still full we still have our homes just walk he says unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you're in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or the left hand just keep keep on moving if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if hardship stri strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God Enoch walked and walked and walked he walked all the way home with God walk with God when the doctor says you're going to die what do you do say it walk with God when your kids are going astray what are you going to do walk with God let me tell you we're living in the hour when the prodal are coming home we've witnessed it in this own church the prodical are coming home why cuz we're walking with God we don't let nothing hinder us we walk with God when disease when you're forsaken walk with God you'll have your ups and downs you're going to have your worries you're going to go through Brier patches sharp rocks Hills Bluffs the mountains Waters but walk with God so in this hour we're living in when everything becomes to come come against us and trials and temptations and snares what are you going to do walk with God musicians if you come as we as we continue to to go through here and we see the things that are happening around us in the political world if Cala wins what are you going to do if milk's $10 a gallon what are you going to do because he's going to take care of us and one of these days you're just going to walk and you're going to walk until you just walk into like a vapor and you're going to be gone and in the moment in the twinkling of an eye all the hardships are gone let's stand to our feet you love the Lord this morning I trust you was blessed this morning by the word God's certainly good he's mindful he knows the hour we're living in he knows the trials we go through he knows the test and the and the Temptations He knows the the struggles it is a time of struggle well it is for some of us he knows the times of struggles but he also said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you that was his promise that's not something I said that's not something I made up he said it I'll never forsake you I'll never forsake you I'll never leave you I'll be with you and in you praise the Lord let's just bow our heads heavenly father thank you Lord for the service you given us thank you for the day and the receptive uh group of Believers that have pulled on the gift and
