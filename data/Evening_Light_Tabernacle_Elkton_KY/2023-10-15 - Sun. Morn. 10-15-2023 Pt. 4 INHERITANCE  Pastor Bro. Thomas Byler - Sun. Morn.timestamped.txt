[1:03:46] what we've come Lord we ask your
[1:03:48] blessing upon the reading of the word
[1:03:49] the meditation of our heart now in Jesus
[1:03:52] name amen
[1:03:54] and amen I'm going to read the
[1:03:56] scriptures and then we're going to recap
[1:03:58] just a little bit if that's okay I
[1:04:00] always like to recap just a little bit
[1:04:01] we won't go all the way back amen I
[1:04:04] think this is about our fifth message on
[1:04:06] this amen but I will maybe mention just
[1:04:09] a little bit of uh some of the things
[1:04:12] we've been speaking on Amen and uh our
[1:04:15] series is on the overview and overview
[1:04:19] of the Christian amen an overview of the
[1:04:21] Christian just looking that what a
[1:04:23] wonderful thing it to be a Christian
[1:04:26] amen and what that encumbers and or
[1:04:28] entails amen and of course amen we could
[1:04:32] go for eternity on
[1:04:34] it amen because that's what Christians
[1:04:37] will do is go for eternity amen so God
[1:04:40] bless you let's turn our Bibles and I'll
[1:04:42] just uh basically uh go to the
[1:04:45] scripture uh that come to me amen when I
[1:04:48] begin to think about this and really the
[1:04:51] overview of a Christian we've been
[1:04:53] talking about the experience of the
[1:04:55] believer On The Backs side of the desert
[1:04:57] and this once again is kind of centered
[1:04:59] on the backside of the desert amen what
[1:05:02] happens on the backside of the desert
[1:05:04] amen so praise the
[1:05:07] Lord let's turn to Matthew if you will
[1:05:10] 13 Matthew
[1:05:20] 13 amen now think about this this is
[1:05:24] also amen a scripture that has to do
[1:05:27] with that backside of the desert
[1:05:29] experience amen Matthew
[1:05:32] 13 and verse
[1:05:35] 44 again the Kingdom of Heaven is liken
[1:05:38] unto a treasure hid in a
[1:05:41] field the which when a man hath found he
[1:05:45] hideth and for Joy therefore goeth and
[1:05:48] selleth all that he have and buth that
[1:05:52] field amen
[1:05:55] again a kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[1:05:57] merchant man seeking goodly pearls who
[1:06:00] when he had
[1:06:01] found amen one pearl of great price went
[1:06:04] and sold all that he had and bought it
[1:06:07] may God add His blessings to the reading
[1:06:09] of the word you can be seated this
[1:06:11] morning amen so my thought this morning
[1:06:15] is that amen what happens on the
[1:06:17] backside of that desert amen and when a
[1:06:20] person comes in contact with God Amen
[1:06:22] when you have an experience
[1:06:24] with almighty God Amen and this is just
[1:06:27] another example of uh a scripture that
[1:06:31] kind of expounds and tells us that amen
[1:06:34] you realize and you find out that you
[1:06:38] found the pearl of great
[1:06:40] price
[1:06:42] amen amen and a little bit about what
[1:06:45] that all encumbers is that all right the
[1:06:48] pearl of great price even Jesus talking
[1:06:50] about it and I want to just uh uh let me
[1:06:54] let me let me just say something I
[1:06:56] didn't say Wednesday that I wanted to
[1:06:58] say amen and it is uh uh let me see here
[1:07:02] if I can find
[1:07:04] it
[1:07:07] um it had here he is in
[1:07:11] Luke in Luke uh 16th chapter in verse 19
[1:07:15] there was a certain rich man which was
[1:07:18] clothed in purple and fine linen fared
[1:07:20] sumptuously every day and there was a
[1:07:22] certain beggar named Lazarus which which
[1:07:24] was laid at the gate full of sores
[1:07:28] Desiring to be fed with crumbs which
[1:07:30] fell from the rich man's table moreover
[1:07:32] the dogs licked his sores and it came to
[1:07:34] pass that the beggar died and was
[1:07:36] carried by the Angels unto Abraham's
[1:07:40] bosom the rich man also died and was
[1:07:42] buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes
[1:07:45] being in torments and seeth Abraham AAR
[1:07:48] off in his bosom amen and he cried and
[1:07:51] said Father Abraham have mercy mercy on
[1:07:54] me and send laus that he may dip the tip
[1:07:57] of his finger in
[1:07:59] water and cool my tongue for I am
[1:08:02] tormented in this place amen amen and so
[1:08:06] it says but Abraham said Son remember
[1:08:08] that thou in thy lifetime receive his
[1:08:10] thy good things and likewise Lazarus is
[1:08:12] evil things but now he is comforted and
[1:08:14] thou art tormented and besides all this
[1:08:18] between fix so that they which would
[1:08:21] pass from hands uh to you who cannot
[1:08:24] come neither can they pass to us that
[1:08:26] would come from F then he said I pray
[1:08:29] thee therefore father that thou would as
[1:08:31] send him to my father's house let's stop
[1:08:34] right there and the reason that I'm
[1:08:36] reading this the reason that I'm saying
[1:08:38] this is because amen I believe that a
[1:08:41] Christian that has met God Amen is going
[1:08:44] to be fulfilling the
[1:08:46] scripture amen amen and so we're going
[1:08:50] to by God's grace fulfill this scripture
[1:08:52] now let me finish it then said he I pray
[1:08:54] thee all right all right send him to my
[1:08:56] father's house now notice he all of a
[1:08:59] sudden became wanted to amen wanted to
[1:09:01] be a missionary isn't that right he
[1:09:03] wanted to go tell his brothers about not
[1:09:05] don't come to this
[1:09:08] place amen amen isn't that what we want
[1:09:11] to yell out this morning to the world
[1:09:12] hey there's a place that you don't want
[1:09:14] to go
[1:09:16] to amen and we've had a scriptural
[1:09:19] warning that you don't want to go there
[1:09:21] you don't have to go there for I have
[1:09:24] five Brethren and that he may testify
[1:09:27] unto them least they also come into this
[1:09:30] place of Torment Abraham said unto him
[1:09:33] they have Moses and the prophets let
[1:09:37] them hear
[1:09:38] them wo think about it how do you and I
[1:09:42] fulfill that scripture because you and I
[1:09:45] believe God's
[1:09:47] prophets is that right we believe what
[1:09:50] God has done we have prepared ourselves
[1:09:52] and we have repented and we've heard
[1:09:54] that message we've heard the
[1:09:56] testimony is that right we've made our
[1:09:59] hearts right we've met God and we've
[1:10:01] repented because we don't want to go to
[1:10:02] that
[1:10:04] place aren't you glad that you can
[1:10:06] fulfill this scripture this
[1:10:08] morning hallelujah thank you Lord let
[1:10:12] them hear them and he said nay Father
[1:10:15] Abraham but if one went unto them from
[1:10:18] the dead they will
[1:10:21] repent and he said unto them if they
[1:10:24] hear not Moses and the prophets neither
[1:10:26] will they be persuaded though one rose
[1:10:28] from the
[1:10:30] dead amen how many knows I'll tell you
[1:10:32] what if you can't believe what God did
[1:10:34] through a prophet in this generation
[1:10:36] there ain't nothing going to make you
[1:10:37] believe you're
[1:10:40] unbeliever and you're going to end up in
[1:10:42] that same place aren't you glad that
[1:10:45] we've had a prophet we've had the dead
[1:10:47] raised me we've had mealings and all
[1:10:49] these things to show us hey don't go
[1:10:51] there but accept hear God's prophets
[1:10:56] hear Moses hear what God has sent so
[1:10:59] that you don't end up going
[1:11:00] there praise the Lord when I think about
[1:11:03] the backside of the desert this morning
[1:11:05] when you meet God Amen and you have that
[1:11:07] experience of meeting God and amen now
[1:11:11] let me just like I said I wanted to
[1:11:12] recap you said okay of course Wednesday
[1:11:14] we talked a little amen about the rest
[1:11:16] amen overcoming and rest having rest no
[1:11:19] matter and not and having an anchor amen
[1:11:23] being Anchored In Christ amen amen and
[1:11:26] so Romans there it says that we're
[1:11:29] persuaded that nothing shall
[1:11:30] separate us or should we say un anger us
[1:11:34] or unhinge US from the love of God when
[1:11:36] you have that experience even Peter
[1:11:38] Peter said there you know when he had a
[1:11:40] revelation of Jesus Christ Our Prophet
[1:11:41] taught you know that revelation God was
[1:11:43] going to build his church upon that rock
[1:11:46] isin't that right and the gates of hell
[1:11:48] would never Prevail against somebody
[1:11:51] that's had a personal experience with
[1:11:53] God God don't have grandchildren you
[1:11:55] can't go in because your preacher said
[1:11:56] it you can't go in because your parents
[1:11:58] said it or have an experience you have
[1:12:00] to have that experience personally amen
[1:12:03] that you've met God Amen and when you
[1:12:05] meet God nothing can take ever that way
[1:12:08] but if the prophet of God said there's
[1:12:09] not enough devils in can talk you out of
[1:12:12] it they can never take that away from
[1:12:15] you so I've been looking at that anchor
[1:12:17] how that a real Christian isn't tossed
[1:12:19] from place to place isn't that right
[1:12:22] praise the Lord Brother B says know see
[1:12:24] we see look at what we got in our Sunday
[1:12:26] school teachers that been talking we all
[1:12:28] know the whole world has become become a
[1:12:31] con glamor but B say of muck and sin and
[1:12:35] despair it's got to get that way to blow
[1:12:38] up the whole thing all the ties are pull
[1:12:42] out pulled out of it naturally and how
[1:12:44] many all of our morality has been pulled
[1:12:46] out until there is not Speck not one
[1:12:48] Speck of morality left anymore not a
[1:12:52] speck of decency anymore anymore amen
[1:12:55] and then the people's just become so
[1:12:57] sinful that it's become a great big
[1:12:59] bunch of muck till it's just like it was
[1:13:01] at the beginning and that God grieved
[1:13:03] that he ever made
[1:13:06] man amen how many would say Lord Jesus I
[1:13:09] don't want you to be grieved that you
[1:13:11] made
[1:13:12] me no let me be pleasing to you Lord
[1:13:16] like Enoch was pleasing to God and he
[1:13:18] was not because testimony that he
[1:13:21] pleased God it's not about pleasing your
[1:13:23] mom dad brother sister Pastor it's about
[1:13:26] you pleasing God this
[1:13:31] morning amen I'm gonna slow
[1:13:36] down I get to going too fast and I'm I'm
[1:13:39] gonna mess up amen all right so now
[1:13:42] notice so we're living in today and I
[1:13:43] notice what he said here that's right oh
[1:13:47] my he says and it'll just take one
[1:13:49] little Atomic jar to set the whole thing
[1:13:51] out of order so we're just living in the
[1:13:54] in that day and happy to be a Christian
[1:13:58] oh my what would I do I don't believe I
[1:14:00] believe I'd go wild if I wasn't a
[1:14:02] Christian looking at this whole thing
[1:14:05] see how I don't see how people can stand
[1:14:07] it I just don't understand how a man can
[1:14:09] walk on Earth today without being a
[1:14:13] Christian I was saying somebody give me
[1:14:16] a reason some reason why not to serve
[1:14:20] Christ oh God has been so oh so good to
[1:14:24] me he has been so faithful with every
[1:14:27] breath that I have I'm going to praise
[1:14:30] him I'm going to talk about the goodness
[1:14:32] of
[1:14:34] God God is so good we truly ought to be
[1:14:39] the happiest people on the face of the
[1:14:44] earth oh the church brother says he
[1:14:48] living a million miles below their
[1:14:50] privileges but yet the scripture says
[1:14:52] that before before God comes she's going
[1:14:55] to be without God and she's going to be
[1:14:57] without rink go amen so somebody's not
[1:14:59] going to be living below their
[1:15:01] privileges before we leave this place
[1:15:04] somebody going to be living up to
[1:15:05] privileges they got to be the kind of
[1:15:07] Christ kind of Christian that
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] need how many believes it look around
[1:15:15] the message see if we ain't coming up to
[1:15:17] living up to our standards and to our
[1:15:19] privileges better believe it I believe
[1:15:23] they are because the coming of the Lord
[1:15:25] is
[1:15:26] close and Satan is getting put under our
[1:15:32] feet that's where he belongs under our
[1:15:36] feet oh
[1:15:39] my give me a sensible reason oh
[1:15:43] my and now notice this is the day that
[1:15:47] we all ought to be
[1:15:49] happy and
[1:15:51] ready happy
[1:15:53] and ready the great home time coming is
[1:15:57] at hand just two old quotes that we go
[1:16:00] on no man has a right to preach the
[1:16:03] gopel no man has a right to call
[1:16:06] themselves a Christian until they can go
[1:16:08] back to a certain time in their life
[1:16:10] where they could come on that sacred
[1:16:12] Sands at the back side of the desert
[1:16:15] where they know that they have met God
[1:16:18] Amen and I want you to get don't you
[1:16:21] never let this pass from you but if a
[1:16:23] man's ever stood on that sacred sand on
[1:16:26] the back side of the desert when he
[1:16:28] meets God face to face there's not
[1:16:30] enough devils and all of hell can take
[1:16:32] that away from him hallelujah how many
[1:16:35] believe that when you're a Son of God
[1:16:37] when you're born again there's not
[1:16:39] enough reinforcements Out of Hell
[1:16:41] there's streams and streams of demon
[1:16:43] powers the prophet of God flowing out
[1:16:45] inhabiting everybody else but when
[1:16:47] there's a real genuine believer there's
[1:16:50] not enough reinforcement to take you
[1:16:52] down
[1:16:55] out it can't be
[1:16:58] done because back there am me God begin
[1:17:01] to build something he be a son a
[1:17:03] daughter of God Amen and when he begins
[1:17:05] to build you he don't do like the
[1:17:08] friends of brother brandom
[1:17:11] did when they take a some kind of a
[1:17:14] Winchester or something and board it out
[1:17:16] to be a 300 weather be Magnum is that
[1:17:20] right board it out to be about 3 weather
[1:17:23] be Magnum and come back and do what out
[1:17:25] on the r amen and uh possessing all
[1:17:30] things this just a lot of quotes I'm
[1:17:32] going be pulling from one of the very
[1:17:33] first things brother Brandon when I when
[1:17:35] I went there to look for these things
[1:17:36] and that's one of the things down that I
[1:17:39] want to mention there was the story of
[1:17:41] the weather be Magnum one of the first
[1:17:42] things he mentioned amen and had bored
[1:17:46] it out but it
[1:17:47] wasn't it hadn't been melted down how
[1:17:51] many know that steel that did take they
[1:17:53] take this steel and they temper it they
[1:17:56] melt it completely down to where it's
[1:17:59] just a liquid and it gets poured into a
[1:18:02] form Ain that
[1:18:04] right amen and whatever it is going to
[1:18:07] be that's what it's supposed to be and
[1:18:08] when you take a gun and man you B it out
[1:18:10] a little bit but your walls are going to
[1:18:12] be thinner and it would not hold the
[1:18:14] pressure he said and it blowed up in his
[1:18:18] face it should have blown his head
[1:18:21] off
[1:18:25] so much pressure per square inch and he
[1:18:28] did get some
[1:18:32] Shel can I talk to
[1:18:35] you you know I've heard a lot about
[1:18:38] things that God did for
[1:18:40] people and you know sometimes they'll
[1:18:42] say that this person was healed but they
[1:18:44] still got
[1:18:45] cancer I'm like because God does a
[1:18:48] halfway
[1:18:51] job they're healed but yet there's
[1:18:54] cancer or something wrong with him and
[1:18:56] so forth and I thought Lord I don't know
[1:18:59] I don't understand
[1:19:01] everything but maybe you could show
[1:19:04] me and I believe he showed me in this
[1:19:08] story
[1:19:10] huh that
[1:19:12] healed brother Ron one one of the
[1:19:14] testimonies baffled me a little bit
[1:19:16] about brother Ron Spencer's
[1:19:18] lungs he they were completely so strong
[1:19:20] on the inside but yet he's got H cancers
[1:19:24] hanging on the
[1:19:25] outside I don't understand that I'm like
[1:19:28] why would God do
[1:19:30] that what God going to do I'm said Lord
[1:19:34] help me to
[1:19:37] understand wouldn't it baffle all of us
[1:19:39] just a
[1:19:40] little but you know when I've read this
[1:19:43] story because brother bam said the devil
[1:19:45] was trying to take his life and he said
[1:19:48] you know it was only the grace of God
[1:19:50] that protected brother bandam but he
[1:19:52] said got shrapnel in his eye he got
[1:19:54] shrapnel here and there isn't that right
[1:19:57] but God still did it work God still
[1:20:00] saved his life so yeah sometimes God can
[1:20:03] do what he wants I'll tell you what if I
[1:20:05] can just move my hand a little bit
[1:20:07] that's God's healing that's god so let's
[1:20:09] give God glory for whatever he chooses
[1:20:11] to
[1:20:12] do maybe we need a little more faith
[1:20:15] maybe we need to go to get b a little de
[1:20:17] I don't know but God can do those things
[1:20:20] and you think well if he's going to
[1:20:22] protect them wouldn't get one bit of
[1:20:23] strap no that be but God allowed a
[1:20:25] little bit to go in but you know that
[1:20:27] that angel kept him from getting
[1:20:30] killed amen that was my answer amen okay
[1:20:35] now I understand amen how many believer
[1:20:38] you have a question there's a Bible
[1:20:40] answer just wait and
[1:20:42] listen god'll tell you praise the Lord
[1:20:46] but what did he say he says that gun was
[1:20:49] not magnet it was not from the factory
[1:20:52] it wasn't built from the ground up and
[1:20:54] he says that's the way a lot of
[1:20:55] Christians are they're not built let me
[1:20:57] tell you something am man you want to
[1:20:59] impersonate Christianity you'll never be
[1:21:02] able to put up with the pressure that a
[1:21:04] Christian has to go
[1:21:06] through you'll never be able to pay for
[1:21:09] those that wrongly use you despitefully
[1:21:11] use you persecute you smack you on the
[1:21:14] cheeks turn the other sh you won't be
[1:21:16] able to your body's not made for that

[1:21:22] you're going to be a Christian you has
[1:21:24] to have a new birth experience to be
[1:21:26] able to put up with the pressure that

[1:21:31] Christian
[1:21:33] faces amen all the persecution that
[1:21:35] comes your way you'll never be able to
[1:21:37] stand it unless you've been born again

[1:21:42] the desert and you have become
[1:21:44] liquified You' got to become liquefied

[1:21:49] mold and reshape you we're not just
[1:21:52] transforming form inen or rehabilitating
[1:21:55] we're completely doing
[1:21:59] transformation amen say God here I am
[1:22:01] make me what you want me to be built me
[1:22:03] the way that I'm supposed to be
[1:22:07] built folks I'm convinced that when God
[1:22:09] built you the of pressure that comes
[1:22:11] your way am me he has built you in such
[1:22:13] a way that your pressures make you
[1:22:16] stronger the more persecution the

[1:23:11] back out of that desert experience where
[1:23:12] God begins to mold you and shape you
[1:23:15] into a Son of
[1:23:20] God when you oh my
[1:23:23] on that back side of the desert when God
[1:23:25] actually accepts you when you have been
[1:23:27] accepted in the
[1:23:29] Beloved when your sacrifice of
[1:23:32] repentance God honors and says all right
[1:23:35] that guy is seriously
[1:23:38] repenting
[1:23:40] huh CU even on the day of Pentecost how
[1:23:43] many days they were up in the upper room
[1:23:44] about 11 days waiting for the promise to
[1:23:47] come Ain that right waiting and waiting
[1:23:51] and waiting for the promise to come
[1:23:53] they had to wait they went out prematur

[1:24:00] waited waited till the Holy Ghost came
[1:24:03] the brother bam says there's no more

[1:24:09] second that you genuinely repent amen
[1:24:13] and God accepts your sacrifice all about
[1:24:15] to beside you with the Holy Ghost you
[1:24:17] might get it here this
[1:24:18] morning the second that you receive it
[1:24:21] and God accepted God will baptize you
[1:24:23] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:24:25] accepts that sacrifice he accepts that
[1:24:30] repentance

[1:24:36] creation I'm a new
[1:24:38] creation created in Christ Jesus unto

[1:24:46] get born again you heard from your
[1:24:50] theophany amen you heard from your
[1:24:55] theophany so let's just
[1:24:57] start first of all you have to recognize
[1:24:59] when you're born again that
[1:25:01] now you begin to
[1:25:04] recognize that you're a
[1:25:07] God before I Lord I'm here I don't I
[1:25:11] don't know if I'm your child I don't
[1:25:13] know I'm just a sinner here I'm no good

[1:25:20] you I can't live without you God if
[1:25:22] you'll have mercy on me and forgive me
[1:25:25] I'll serve you all the days of my life
[1:25:27] what if he don't forgive you what if you
[1:25:29] go back with the same way that you ever
[1:25:31] came huh then God doesn't accept you God
[1:25:35] didn't accept you but when he accepts
[1:25:38] you something
[1:25:39] happens says something has to happen a
[1:25:43] change has to take
[1:25:47] place I don't care kids I don't care if

[1:34:03] saved and one of the first things that
[1:34:07] you
[1:34:08] inherited the greatest thing that you
[1:34:11] inherited was
[1:34:14] Grace

[1:34:20] here in Chapter 2 of
[1:34:25] Ephesians even when verse 5 even when we
[1:34:28] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[1:34:31] together with Christ by grace are ye
[1:34:34] saved and hath raised us up together and
[1:34:37] made us to sit together in Heavenly
[1:34:40] places in Christ Jesus that in the ages
[1:34:43] to come he might show the exceeding
[1:34:47] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[1:34:50] towered up us through Jesus Christ for
[1:34:54] by grace are you saved
[1:34:57] amen through
[1:34:59] faith and that not over yourselves it's
[1:35:03] is the gift of
[1:35:08] God Amen how many believe
[1:35:15] that in
[1:35:18] Romans 5 it says therefore be being
[1:35:21] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:35:25] God how many knows before you before the
[1:35:27] backside of the desert you didn't have
[1:35:29] peace with your dog you didn't have
[1:35:32] peace with your neighbor you had no
[1:35:34] peace with yourself there is no peace
[1:35:35] sayith the Lord For The Wicked but now
[1:35:39] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:35:41] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord by
[1:35:44] whom also we have access by faith into
[1:35:48] this grace woo how many know that it
[1:35:51] takes the faith of God Amen it even that
[1:35:55] faith is a gift of
[1:35:57] God cuz you can't never get nowhere as a
[1:36:01] Son of God daughter of God on the backs
[1:36:03] side of the desert as you go forward
[1:36:05] amen you can't even get a hold of God
[1:36:07] until he does a work of Grace and grants
[1:36:10] you
[1:36:12] Faith to
[1:36:15] believe you won't start you won't finish
[1:36:17] you won't make it through the middle you
[1:36:19] won't make it nowhere outside of faith
[1:36:22] and that's by
[1:36:25] great but you have got to have faith to
[1:36:27] accept his
[1:36:29] grace right oh it's just not for me I'm
[1:36:32] not good enough I've done too many bad
[1:36:34] things talk the devil's language but

[1:36:59] and stealing they don't want to but they
[1:37:01] do and they don't want to he says

[1:37:07] don't want to be that way but the person
[1:37:09] that's happy being that way he don't
