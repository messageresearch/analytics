good to have everybody in the house of the Lord tonight and amen we just want to uh share something that has been Stern in my heart and I certainly haven't got as much of it as what I'd like but amen we're going to share just a little bit of it with the help of the Lord tonight amen amen and so let's just bow our heads we're going to the Lord and prayer father we come before you Lord Jesus once again grateful to be assembled in your house Lord and thankful for the privilege of being able to come into your house to worship you in spirit and in truth for you have said wherever two or three are gathered there you would be in our midst Lord Jesus we know that you love it father when we come together Lord assemble ourselves together Lord and to speak of your word and to magnify you to worship you father and we ask God that he was just bless the meditation of a heart that which Lord we've been kind of mulling over for the last few weeks Lord Jesus we just ask God that you would just say what you once said tonight Lord Jesus have your sweet way and father just bless each one that has come tonight Lord we know that you know every heart you know every thought you know all about us Lord Jesus you prove that through the messenger of Malachi forlord and Lord how you would discern the thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord and father we know that you know our needs father we just bring it all before you we're open book before your father you know us Lord Jesus we just ask God that you'd look and see if there's any wicked way any way that's in there that's not pleasing to you Lord father that you would correct that Lord Jesus and that you draw us closer to you Lord not holding her intent tonight is Lord to draw closer to you father so help us Lord Jesus we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen if you will we'll just go into the word of God let's start with Revelations Amen in the Book of Revelations and uh amen some of this here this has come from uh the the things that I've been doing and uh tried to play it here a few Wednesdays ago about the Azusa Street Revival we know that God did a great work it was another it was another beginning of a work that God was going to do just like he did when he did with Martin Luther or John Wesley and so forth but it came much much more closer to looking like the real church amen the real acts the book of Acts it was so close as a matter of fact that they called themselves Pentecostals amen because on the day of Pentecost when we know that a prophet taught that you got the every individual has to have a Pentecostal experience amen and Pentecost is not a church or a move but it is an experience that we have with almighty God Amen and so I want to try to start with the with with reading the word and then amen perhaps uh maybe expounding a little bit on this Revelations and for and we'll begin with um verse 1. now after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the voice first voice which I heard was as it were the trumpet talking with me and switch said come up higher come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and three sat on the throne no that's not correct is it not when John got up there he realized there's only one that sat on the throne amen amen and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was said heaven and one side on the throne and he that sat sat was to look upon like Jasper and sardine stone amen I just right off the top of my head I think that each of the tribes of Judah or Israel were represented in one of those stones and if I'm not wrong that was the first and the last if I'm not wrong amen and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an into an emerald and round about The Throne were Four and Twenty seats and upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty Elders sitting clothes in white Raymond and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and Thunders and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God and Before the Throne was uh there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal and in the mid the throne and round about The Throne there were four beasts now notice here we have found Four and Twenty Elders now we're finding four beasts now we could take great time in going into the Old Testament Amen in finding Isaiah and so forth to different places where they had seen these beasts before these Powers before Amen in the Old Testament now we find them way down here round about The Throne there were four beasts full of eyes before and behind the first Beast was like unto a lion and the second was like unto a calf the third Beast was like the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes within amen let me just say this and Isaiah sixth chapter remember he went into the temple and these cherubims and so forth had six wings with two defluitive with two they covered the face and two amen defeat I believe it was amen now and then verse 8 the last was a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were okay uh full they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and which is to come and we know fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying our worthy O Lord to receive honor and glory and I mean glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and forth by Pleasure they are and were created amen may God that is blessings to reading the word you can be seated tonight amen praise the Lord amen amen I remember one thing I would just want to pick up here with with the Revival of Azusa Street amen and we know that it lasted for black three to three and a half years Republic God said no Revival has hardly everlasted between Beyond around three or so years phenomenal thing about this and the things that kind of caught my attention was they begin to worship God and of course the Holy Ghost begin to come down and I mean that makes all the difference in the world amen all the difference in the world Amen to come down and these people [Applause] people in it it was day and night for I don't even know how exactly how long but it was uh up to around a three year period that they would worship and and day and night they would go and isn't it something how the people even up here and uh I forget the name of this place up here now in in uh in Kentucky what was the name of that town Asbury you know the Asbury Revival kind of caught our attention a little bit he caught my attention enough to kind of look at it and and maybe get a few uh uh uh looking a few people who were there and some of the students that you know and they would say things like you know yeah the people have come and they've enjoyed the Revival now take it home because that's what a lot of people would do they would take their Revival home and no matter where you go you can take the Revival with you but I thought praise be to God that ain't nothing but the truth isn't it right you can take that Revival with you no matter where you go it's not just Asbury or wherever it is but it's wherever the presence of God is tonight's focus is on how that we can get into this revival amen and then and you know I was driving down the road let me just throw these out at you but you know I made the thought the thought came to my mind is that you shouldn't need Revival I thought brother time what in the world are you thinking anything you look at that you look you look Revival and in the Revival means to bring something back from the dead to revive something so why did I say you shouldn't need Revival because you ought to already be revived but I half dead preach with me tonight is that the truth we ought to be everybody brother man says you should I constantly live in Revival laughs amen you know I you know the one thing about it you know the one thing about revivals like a Souza Street people who stayed after service one of the things that Asbury and those students did after service was over they stayed they stayed and they stayed till 12. they said to one to two to three to four to five not one week two weeks but then state and I was told even over back way back in the Azusa Street it was the Segway that just stayed they stayed amen and they would have three services a day 24 7. I just didn't have a week after week after week three services a day how would you and I even last and all that right think about it and I thought about it and they said the sings and songs back then I guess I from an understanding it's probably the Church of God and where they've been decided not to have any music because from what I understand if I didn't misunderstand is that they didn't have any musical instruments it was just the people singing and I think the Church of God is the one that don't believe in musical instruments and Pentecostal Church of God you know no musical instruments you know which we know that there's no real scripture for it ain't that right because we like our musical instruments I like my drums I like my guitar I like my strings I like to play it on the eye string you know I like to play it on the high notes like like David said playing on the High Street worshiping the hard spring that's the way I believe in worshiping God Amen on the high notes I believe in and you know amen praise the Lord Brother Now give me a picture brother amen I mean those Focus I get older I realize that that scripture means more to me that all of those voices and all of those Powers came down and they worshiped God and said he's worthy of honor he's worthy of Glory he's worthy of power because as I lose my power and my strength I realize he has all power he has all strengths he's worthy of honor he's worthy of praying people are scream at ball games and everything else and worship all of that amen give players and the hell am I to players that can do great things with footballs until I'm up and down and then just test jump from the three point line perhaps go up in the air and come down and dunk the ball and Michael Jordan or they'll get him all by at that time no I'm not angry I'm just seriously come on folks they worship the creation more than the Creator what about the man that made a man to be able to do no things don't you think you ought to have a little honor have a little yeah I think he does I think he's worthy of a whole lot more honor and more Glory than what we give him that's why David wasn't afraid to strip off his clothes almost and dance before the garden and amen act the fool for him Thomas and I'm a fool for Christ I don't care I foolish I look I do it for Christ amen time should stop a little when you have eternity coming out the presence of Eternity coming now forget about the clock so many times we come to church and by the end of the service we're starting the other end you know it's starting to lose it up all right it's time to close man we are just starting to have a good time folks when we was getting intoxicated on the world with uh juices and so forth we'd go to the next bar if this one closed isn't that right we gonna find the neck before five o'clock we were still out there doing something come on folks listen think about it so the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit comes out and people get locked like I said they would sing and they'd talk about an Angelic choir joining in with them I want you to know something people that can't can't see God and don't see God they don't look for him because that was God that was God amen and that was just the beginning of the great Revival how many knows it was just the beginning Asus Street was just a small fraction of the real Revival we know what happened with all of that and even the father God said this here this message that's been going forth you know it's been 15 years and it is still going I mean please hit the message in this hour it don't stop amen this revival ain't doing higher and it don't quit really Glory hey man so it's an atmosphere of Eternity and think about it hear their scripture that I read to you and the point that I wanted to make which we know as our prophet and I taught us that those four Beast Powers represent sending four powers lion was Paul's age isn't that right the ox was the martyrs that give their lives and boy the burden of giving their lives down through the dark ages of Thirteen hundred fourteen hundred fifteen hundred twelve nine eight seven all of those hundreds of years that they had the 68 million Christians that were killed ruthlessly by the Catholic church in that writing by the Pope the second beast and the third piece was the face of a man amen that was John Wesleyan or the the Reformation that we came forth and amen man was man spreading the word but the last power was an eagle age it was an eagle power you can't operate I can't operate I can't preach other than what the inspiration of the Holy Ghost gives me to preach I'm a steel and dry and rotten and no good as anything if anything for the power of the Holy Ghost but there was an eagle age calling up higher than anything amen and those four powers if you'll notice amen those four powers are there and I thought about this and this maybe I shouldn't even say it but I guess I will for just for anyhow because I think you can take it but I didn't know there was night over there did you I didn't know there was night over there so I don't know if there is or not I'll leave that to your mind your question but to me it's a and not in other words they never quit it does something that when a real believer gets in the presence of God it's hard to quit it's sad and you gotta go home and go to bed it's sad when you gotta go to work I mean those one of these days we'll never have to go back to work we'll never have to get that old alarm and I got to get back to work release that or the other we can be that into God's presence and why worship him through eternity it's what we are going to do if you don't think so read Revelations I heard the boys the mighty thunderings praising and worshiping God it was like thunder the voice of much people's Hallelujah honor and Glory and Power amen that's what we're gonna do starting now huh if you ain't worshiped like you ought to don't wait till tomorrow start now what if we go on till 1 2 o'clock tonight um I like when I can be myself folks I'm here to tell you if I push it and we stay here too long you are going to be miserable when is she ever gonna quit that's what you're gonna be saying he says holding us because he wants to hold us and that's what it would be huh but if he would come down if that you kind of Glory come down hey every time those of us we just forget about time it'd be a whole different story because I as a preacher don't believe in manufacturing something no it has to be done by the Holy Ghost hey man I looked at that people that would try they would pray for a for four hours they would pray so many times and then what did they do amen they put themselves for eight hours a day to pray how about you working for the four o'clock and when you get home at five you're gonna pray all the way until almost midnight just pray and pray and pray and pray to get into the presence of God to get yourself all really good and scoured out cause blessings are the hungry for they shall be filled how many believe that oh my I believe it I didn't even look at my notes tonight y'all are really pulling hard amen you love the Lord tonight but that atmosphere oh that atmosphere you know I like to scream and shout and jump and dance but most of the time when that she kind of Glory comes out it is a sacred it is a different it is different this is this is Joy Bells amen but when that comes it says sacred thing because it's God himself coming down and you lose track of time you don't worry about time the world becomes not important to you let me tell you how many that's what holds us back a lot of times our jobs are too important our work is too important our prayer is not important enough look I want to get this job done so I can come home and I can pray and I can sing on the Lord a little more that's what we ought to be doing amen we ought to be looking for more time to spend in that Chicana Glory in that presence I need to tell you I'm a strong believer tonight that a person can live in that presence 24 7. all the time you can I believe it that's what Jesus died for amen praise be the god are you ready to start let's start my brother bam one time he was a electric reader man he would go collect the electric bills and from what I understand people would intentionally not pay their electric bill because they wanted to for him to come by and oh pray and so forth it's kind of Manny was but he went to this one house and to collect the electric bills they were late and there was a girl in there dancing half naked and so forth and and he says I'm here to collect the lack right and all this is all right Testament and she went off somewhere and rock and roll playing and some diddly doo diddly do he says amen and about forgot excuse me man but I mean oh okay I forgot you was here I'm going to a certain dance tonight isn't that right and I was just kind of getting things ready to go everybody talk about another ministers that was going around to his congregation amen getting them to sign cars that did come to church so many times out of the year is that right and brother Bob says you know this relating lady here that he would probably Pond the rest of her clothes just a boy make sure she could go to that party go to that dance you didn't have to just get hurt or something find a photo card amen oh my listen there I said she would Pawn uh would go and she would Pawn off her shoes to go if she had to if you had an old-fashioned altar call down at the church and get those people filled with the Holy Ghost when the church bell rings he says hey man you're not out to sign any cards you'll come at him oh how many please come into the church going to church is the best time I've ever had is the best time of the week it's a privilege and a honor to be able to come together amen because he said he didn't say stay home where one is he said wherever two or three have got it then I'll be enough we got to love church more than what we do we gotta love him more than what we do happening together amen how many believe that oh my I'm gonna do a little reading is that okay oh my now notice he says listen to this you'll never know what perfect satisfaction is he says you may be tossed about to and fro joining churches and running and trying to see this that or the other every time a little something new happens here you go to a new life or just something new one of the points I want to break now I want to talk about that chicane Glory living in that Chicana Glory three places people live this is back something a lot of us have heard before but we know that this was set up in the Old Testament this is the way to Israel the camp of Israel was set up there are three tribes on each side three six nine twelve Twelve Tribes all around there protecting this first this uh Tabernacle in the wilderness in the middle and when you first come in there was this labor here amen that's where your sacrifice for your sin amen would be brought amen and it would be burnt right there and taken care of you represented the Justified man isn't that right then we come over to the water you'd get washed and then in the third place you'd come in here and here would be that the holies amen it had the seven candlesticks notice how the seven candlesticks we read in Revelations he's at the seventh candle six or the seven spirits of God and amen that represented these candlesticks and so forth there was some different things the table of shoe bread and the angels and so forth but there was another place and it was all the way back here the Ark of the Covenant was amen and there was cherubims over the ark Amen in that manner that had fell down in the wilderness they put it in there Amen to that manner right in there stayed fresh all the time Glory we're going to talk about those three different places three different stages three different places people live now a prophet taught us that we live like in a three-room house living room kitchen in the bedroom and also he talked about that we're going through different stages to under Luther it was justification understanding and the rest it was sanctification and then in Pentecost and so forth with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says the Holy Ghost makes a way for the Holy Ghost himself amen those be places Martin Luther smoke a pipe back a little mirror maybe just then it is out of the other he was just testified he was in that state and he lived out in the outside world Amen whenever it rained out if it rained guess what you got wet it was a lightning thunderstorm day that's what you've done there that's how some people are folks hey man I'll say it would live under the weather whatever the conditions around them are that's what they're like I want you to know this is the hour that God wants to stabilize us he wants to establish us he wants you to stabbing them all stand stand therefore he don't want he don't want you to be wavy he don't want you to be wishy-washy this is not an hour to be where she wants it is another hour to waver amen this is an hour We're called to come into the holies of holies this is for us even the Pentecostals didn't come into here they were too busy fighting and fussing with one another by the weather he was coming on a white horse or a cloud and These Foolish message people that will fuss and split over Wellness to seven seal opener isn't it is it the seven trumpets to Israel listen to this Saturday other people will fuss over all kinds of things you act like a Pentecostal Amen brother Allah I'll prefer to preach it think about it I ain't got time for that I don't care how he's coming just so he comes and just so I'm ready to meet him are you with me oh man I thought about me I thought about titling English Perugia God's presence God's presence it's so awesome the greatest place in the world it's so phenomenal those people for three years would do that huh just because of that presence it's something about the presence of God how many knows every one of you bring that little lick of fire the church you bring that amen true see it does something it establishes you it doesn't how many knows uh talking about atmosphere Prophet taught us about atmosphere you can take a dog or you can take a chicken egg and you put it in a hatchery and you keep that at a certain temperature isn't that right that certain temperature will hatch that cheek amen or if you laid that if you laid that egg under a dog and kept that right temperature he would hatch chickens but that's the way it is with almighty God and bringing four Sons and Daughters of God it takes the atmosphere the Holy Ghost it takes his happened to me when I was 20 years old amen the Holy Spirit come down and quickened that seed that was the inside made all the difference in the world they and not isn't it something I think I how you can do it so long but we're Mortals yet we still have to do our jobs we have to supply for our families and all that in there we we have to do all that but today will come where we'll not do it for three years now we'll do it throughout all of eternity there's oh you can't imagine what it's gonna be like amen brothers and sisters come me to his presence don't be just in this Justified state amen listen to what he says every time a little something new happens here then you go to somewhere else new thing why don't you just come to Christ and settle the whole thing once born again that settles it forever once born of the spirit of God you have everlasting life and cannot come into the condemnation isn't that right but has passed from Death unto life then you can enjoy yourself then it's pleasure it's a pleasure to pray you don't have to wonder about whether what God's doing when you kneel to pray you're right in his presence when you walk into the streets you're right in his presence wherever you are you're in his presence all the time you have perfect Fellowship amen with the son of God amen this is going to be challenging for us it's a challenge for me but I love to challenge myself oh my what a marvelous Victorious Life and this is what got to thinking about a statement he made he says Hey halfway life is the most miserable thing there is to play just enough Justin of religion to know that if you ain't right you're gonna be thrown at your Lake of Fire nothing to scare you not to make him do that that's what religion generally takes teaches yeah but if that's all you have you're miserable halfway is a miserable life let me ask you something what's lukewarm lukewarm is halfway isn't it in between hot or cold even Jesus says I would that you were hot or cold so that because you are lukewarm because you are halfway I will feel you out of my mouth folks if you're a Halfway Christian just halfway living a crazy life you're a miserable person the most miserable person there is somebody that don't go all the way just goes part of the way huh just comes to a specified state or a Sanctified state but never baptized with the Holy Ghost never come into that you kind of Glory that totally takes care of all of your problems yeah I mean that's what I feel like my Ministry it's to get us to come up higher we as Christians to go much deeper than what we are go a little higher than what we have come to the place that you can break the sound barrier amen I understand them Jets whenever they're about to break that sound barrier it'll feel like that airplane's coming apart it'll feel like everything that rivet's gonna pop loose amen but boom hey man they'll break through that and it'll be smooth after that oh I've tried to overcome this now I've tried to overcome that that the blood of Jesus Christ bring you to the sound barrier amen and I'll tell you what you'll say praise be to God that thing behind me I've got victory in my life I've overcome nothing [Applause] huh oh brother bam says he knows people him and he'll jump and scream and shout in church and then Hades brother bam says you're lost you're so statement that he means you're lost you either come all the way or don't come at all isn't that right Jesus Christ didn't say well bring this and bring God he says unless you're willing to forsake all to follow me you're not worried that everybody all the way not halfway thank you amen whatever it takes he wants all your time amen oh buddy Robinson remember he was out there plowing with his horses and he was his horse didn't do right and he got mad and bit him on the ear I believe his hit him over the head realized boy I am supposed to be a Christian but I'm not he's his God I'm gonna kneel right down here and if you don't give me the baptism the Holy Ghost you're gonna find the pile of bones when you get back he was determined he was going to stay there until something happens and something happened God loves determination amen not halfway Lord I don't want to be halfway to you okay man I sure don't amen Saul was halfway and I don't want to dwell on this much I want to get to my point amen boy we got plenty of time it's five after six I'm plenty of time brother I'm gonna keep watching that clock back there right I ain't got my phone hey man you love him Hallelujah God is good isn't he so now notice listen here once born again you have everlasting life then you can enjoy yourself it's a pleasure to do all these things but the most miserable thing is a halfway life amen he was talking to a man he says see what kind of life that you're walking in I said according to the weather it gives light outside but yet it's gloomy it's foggy isn't that how it is on the first stage there's no roof over anything there's no roof there's no ceiling no nothing so whatever the outside's like that's what people like ah you meet some people and boy they got a smile on their face to shake your hand in the next boy they'll look the other way and they got a big old work frown on their face huh nobody here now I I don't think it you know this is not pointing fingers but if I ain't careful it's Thomas baller huh can happen to all of us if you aren't careful where are you living at where are you living at tonight what kind of life listen foggy halfway half bright day they're ready to Justified man lives that's right that's all the light that he has to walk in and so forth this man I was talking to he says I come to Christ brother Ben am I going to church I put my name on the book and I'm trying to live the very best that I can well bless your heart brother I appreciate that God bless appreciates that if you believe he hears my words and believes on him that's the most miserable part person I have to just fight every day oh yes brother that's where you're walking he says that's all right then see then you want to go a little deeper amen I believe you want to go a little deeper you might have spoken tongues you might do this Saturday or the other but you're still living by artificial light or the light of the Moon maybe the starred maybe the Moon is just a quarter moon maybe it's just a sliver maybe the Stars aren't shining bright huh how many those in this mortality this house that we live in will always have those times the light isn't shining so bright things are looking real gloomy but listen that's got nothing to do with this man in here nothing to do with you amen if you're on the inside the way the outside is you need to alter tonight you need to stay here a while to God I need a deeper walk with you amen I need to get closer to you Lord oh man the man that is justifying these courts when Night comes he has a very dim light just the Stars maybe a pale moon or a lot of flying clouds he's an awful fix but the man who walks beyond that and goes in where the world is shut off when that Veil drops behind him down under the Locking wings of the cherubims all the way down here that great Shekinah Glory hung there it never got them [Music] it never went out you know these lights here would always they always have to trim these lamps and refill the oil and all of that and trim the Wicks and so forth they always have to do that that's how sometimes we are man I need a good laptop I need another Revival I need this I need that but listen you aren't called to live out there yeah you called to live in here in the presence of God you see this van this vase Veil right here how many knows Aaron was the only one that was a lot to go in behind that Veil and when Jesus died the Bible says when he died this veil was written from top to bottom rip now how many knows it didn't just rip by itself God ripped it God ripped that mail and said now the price is paid not just Aaron can come back here but anybody that wants to can come into my presence I'm melanese out of God I need to come into your presence I don't care so yeah I don't want to go for just a year a lot of people start oh there's men running this race but with the light refused to keep Ace others accepted because of these new but very few expect to go through I'm going through I'm going to no matter what else others do well there's too many Hypocrites in the church so I'm gonna stay home let me tell you something when you stay out of church you're obedient to the devil you are obedient to the devil when you quit Church you stay out of church you just fall right into his tricks you know what I've come to the conclusion this week what the hell is going to be full of Hell's is going to be full of Hypocrites and those who were stumbled by hypocrites those who are stumbled by Hypocrites and the Hypocrites are going to have a good time to get well not a good time but he's gonna they're gonna be sharing some time together don't hide behind the hypocrite well not everything is ought to be in church you know this out of the other folks have had him in the case I'd have been gone a long time ago you'd have been gone a long time ago if you expected Thomas Viola to be perfect it's okay it won't hurt hey man that's right I thank God for the grace of the people and I have Grace for the people let God work on it but don't Fall by the wayside don't waver don't be tossed like the waves of the Sea of James 1. for a man that waverth is like a wave of the sea tossed amen and Paul said Ephesians 4 he says he sent the fivefold ministry pastors preachers evangelists for the perfecting of the Saints for the unity of the do we all come to the unity of Faith unto the statue of the fullness of the of the statute of the fullness of Christ to and through there in the presence of God how many believe that stand amen don't be wishy-washy stand when you're in the presence of God it does something for you how many knows it anchors you amen when Christ comes into your soul not just your flesh but not in this as your spirit but he comes into your soul it's the anchor That Glory is a anchor sure and steadfast according to Rome with Paul said I tell you what there ain't no height no depths no persecution no tribulation nothing can separate you from the love of God if God's love is in your eyes enough people to stop you that enough hypocrates enough for the Temptations of the devil or to get you out of there nothing will separate you from God's love amen that's worshiping the Lord my when I think about that the presence of God how privileged we are as satisfaction it brings you know there's so many people in that side people are halfway satisfied well I'm kind of satisfied I went to church and I paid my tithes and I gave a little offering you know and I listened to the preacher but I'm going out these doors and I'm still the same miserable person I came in huh not doing you much good is it it's just kind of you just do your religion don't just do your religion go all the way I mean he's with me let's go all the way Give a Heart completely and reservedly to God 24 7 every part of our life every person coming or going we're down sleeping or awake on our bedpost every part is all gone instead you'll have a while you live in Revival oh my I don't know I may not be there yet you may not be there but we can be I believe it are you with me Hallelujah Saul remember he was made king of Israel and God told him go in there and you destroy those enemies and you destroy every last one of them you destroy their sheep their goats are everything you know the last one he brought a bunch of sheep back brought to King back if I understand brought him back you know in the sacrifice of God and he was a halfway he obeyed halfway oh here we go back to halfway he obeyed halfway boy was she ever miserable wasn't he the rest of his life he was miserable he had to have music just to cheer him up a little bit and win the last drum beat Amen in the last guitar string strong after that he was a mean fella he was even mean and jealous while they were playing isn't that right he was so upset he was so miserable he threw a spear at David a couple times trying to kill him jealous of him I mean he knows who knows who else is miserable this generation that you and I are living in this layout of CA says that you are richly Christian of God you have need of nothing but you don't know that you're naked miserable poor blind and naked and you don't know it a miserable generation people got a two tattooed themselves they gotta put nose rings in you got to do this out of the other they got to become a man they got to become a woman of you miserable bunch of creatures Hellbound demon possessed miserable you are imaginable and you know it I don't know about you but I'm no one I'm miserable but bam said about a backslider yeah you can backslide Christian you can't but you are going to be the most miserable person when you get away from God how many has ever experienced it get away from God get away from the Holy Ghost and boy you talk about miserable that's right sin do something you ought to do man it's terrible I hope you get so miserable you never do it again they all pardon me I need to tie my shoe you love the Lord miserable miserable people why let me ask let me say this not half but the prophet preached the Bible says that full obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the Token full obedience so if you're not blessed God could never fully bless Abraham until he did what God Said do separate yourself from your daddy and from your I mean from your nephew lot separate yourself come on out but he brought them with them in his office they were there Abraham and his servants were miserable they probably almost got in a fist fight at the water fountain it says there was Strife between their herdsmen how many knows whenever there's belief and I'm believing dwelling together there's gonna be some mystery misery that's why we don't need any unbelief in the church you let unbelief in getting one of you and it's going to cause misery to this church you're gonna cause misery to somebody because you're gonna try to spread misery you know so we thought they just ain't quite right huh all right get off that I want you happy be happy I want you free I'm here to tell you if you don't get the anchor of Jesus Christ in your heart you're going to be tossed all over the place your feelings and your emotions your desires that your flesh has I'll take you all over the place but Christ anchors that thing and brings it down Center washes you from all of your sins you ain't got to worry about hell you ain't got to worry about the great white Throne judgment you're not even gonna be in it the Bible says that James Saints are going to be doing the judge don't you know that the Saints shall judge the world he comes with ten thousand thousand Saints the Bible says to execute judgment on those Wicked oh my how can you hold your seat divided you guys are saying ain't got to worry about the judgment you're going to call me be with Christ in the judgment that's there for now no condemnation to them to learn cry how can you judge somebody that ain't no condemnation he knew the sun sets free as free indeed we got too many people that are still slaves they're slaves to their job they're slaves to time they're changed some money just leaves to love the slaves to their homes and their Entre all kinds of slaves constrains to themselves man something else I had in mind wrote down that is the reason people are halfway is because most of a lot of Christians so-called want to serve two masters you want to serve two men and you can't do that Jesus said but they want to be the church they want to be a Christian they want to make it to heaven but yet they want to do their own thing all right and your own thinks the devil thing it's got to be Christ and what he says are you with me Lords let's serve one master and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm starting to get too worried about the time now but that's all right all right praise the Lord God is the Shekinah Glory don't you realize that preaching and you pulling brings the presence of God down when we sing those songs we're marching design and beautiful beautiful Zion God inhabits the praise of his people God inhabits your amens God inhabits your praise the Lord God it happens it happens to praise of his people he loves it don't you think that whenever a defensive football team is out there and everybody goes simultaneously defense defense don't you think the big old quarterbacks them old not a quarterback for them defensive back they're going to take yeah that's right you heard him box hey man when somebody's afraid your body makes a preacher that's right Hallelujah just fix him amen and the Lord likes it Heaven likes it your last Heaven loves the word amen Revelations 19 the whole voice and dial one of the first things that boy said they said amen Hallelujah that means praise our God Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah get this thing unfold and shake it a little blessed be the name of the Lord God is good God is good God is done God is worthy of honors power and strength he's worthy of it he's an awesome God he made this whole world [Applause] [Music] he made my hands he made my mouth he made my eye he made everything and he chose me to live why can't I worship him alone her let his presence come down tonight all the way down into your soul Glory oh God it's good you're going to be a praise pray brother Brian can jump like that after the surgery huh hope he gets it feeling better he's like get to doing better amen he's our healer oh my God he's good isn't he God is good hey man all right listen now now this here right in the middle it might go out but in here I notice in the holies of holies all the way to your left he was kind of a Mystic light kind of a soft glowing light and the believer at rest walks around inside that Veil the Shekinah Glory where the pot of Mana was where he eats daily oh I wonder if that ain't we failing eating daily having a fresh Revelation from God daily amen just had the little thought just a little thought God damn you you shouldn't need Revival thank you Jesus with you don't need Revival that means you're a river it's your life that's what we need to be not to have resuscitation Glory live in Revival now so there I take my last breath to my voice gets weaker sometimes I come up here and I gotta I think I'll be able to talk I'm like what in the world's going on even my voice is failing me but not tonight praise be to God huh that's right in that brother Glenn knows it's harder to talk when you get older even my hands feeling good Hallelujah I'm Healed why I'm inside eating Mana daily [Applause] never gives out want to eat from that manner oh my he's got not a worry in the world how many believe that when you're God's child he's got his angels watching over you he promised he would Supply your daily need don't worry about what you were eating what you'll dress yeah heavenly father has knows that you have need of these things I don't care what your situation is God almighty God will take care of your problem what a wonderful place to be knowing that he's got you he's got your things taken care of amen we ain't throwing the touchdown pass yet folks but we're fixing to oh my God you love him he's not gotta worry in the world everything was taken care of God was over him listening to him as he prays and answering his prayers not only that but he's living right in the presence of the king right in the presence of the king every one of us is amateur creators every one of us has more about us whether we're Meek and quiet this that or the other when we get around one another word rest we can tell when we're cheerful we can tell but get into the presence about how sweet it is to go out in a Rose Garden as to pray to God put it put it out in the Rose Garden of a fresh morning what to do is come down Amen in the fragrance of all those flowers are everywhere whoa that is so wonderful so sweet and so calm was so precious that's the way it is a Believer is when he's been praying for eight hours you don't come out of prayer for a long period of time and scream and holler and fuss with your neighbor and worry about all the little things that might bother you otherwise it's even nice and when you get around believe it says oh it's so nice to see you my brother so nice to see you my sister God bless you how are you for otherwise you just kind of go on all right now notice he's living right in the presence of the king God into Chicana Glory every time something would start up like that it just couldn't get him couldn't get him how'd you like to live in a place the devil can't get you I've got a scripture for it let me just read first John 5 and verse 18 we know that whosoever born of God sent us not but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself and that Wicked one touches him not can anybody say Amen [Applause] now we all said amen and that's good but we still have a little growing that you don't see sometimes he don't touch me you know what when you're a Christian you're still with the Holy Ghost the only way the devil can get to you is for you to come out behind that you kind of Glory you got to come out to him a lot of times Temptation the Bible says you're drawn away from Temptation and so forth amen drawing away you come out you let that thought like Phil Bond he said you let that thought in you're the one that let it live he didn't but if you I don't know about you but I want to be like that I want to hear the devil can't touch you no matter what comes no matter what goes he can't get to you because he sure wants to amen now notice if you ever come into Christ my friend ever come into the place where the world is dead whether your children are this way or your mother is that way or your daddy said this way or your pastor said that oh come on folks let's admit it sometimes as you think the devil I mean that devil the pastor is the devil talking to you or something oh boy he was preaching at me folks if I ever preach directly at somebody then I need another trip to the altar I preach against sin and if it follows your lot I can't help that but it's the devil's business to get on your shoulder and make you feel like that was personally to you and I'd give you an attitude about it don't let the devil do that no matter what the pastor said what the doctor said this that or the other you don't even hear it you live only in the Shekinah Glory love walking and living in the presence of the king every day is sweet in your soul oh my all is well all is well there's nothing that can harm you oh my praise be to God aren't you glad for that reasons we're not getting anywhere today is because we got too many dry eye confessions and church joinings too much lukewarmness backslitness church members that's the truth we need more of that old-fashioned Holy Ghost godsend Saint Paul Revival and the holy ghost power of breaking up and me making people act different look different walk different talk different and be different and live different in their day every day life are you with me I think that's what's the matter with our church today we got a lot of these different layovers some people just eat enough Mana to make them good and hungry for some more before one Revival to another one and you have to go out and get all renewed again huh oh brother why don't you stop that nonsense and come into the holies of holies by the blood of Jesus Christ every bit of men are outside of here just let you last for tonight or tomorrow or next week it won't work it dries up overnight but if you'll ever consecrate yourself to come into where the Mana stays friend mistake in and they out here in and year out in the holies of holies I don't care if you just simply preach about the gospel amen of Jesus Christ died on Calvary for me amen it's still fresh and it's still good to you you'll never say oh I heard that before you'll say tell it to me again brother why because it's fresh but if you're not in that holies of holies oh my is he gonna preach that again he preached that 30 years ago he preached at 15 years ago 20 years ago 22 years ago 10 years ago five years ago a year ago nice preaching it again you're right I'm gonna keep preaching until we get to the place we need to be oh it's still good I love it don't you to know that you can come to this place we are honored come into the presence of God you couldn't come there before we know that God those cherubim says Shield them from coming back into the presence of God In the Garden of Eden but when Jesus Christ died he says come on back into my presence now come on the home children living my presence not just on church on day Sundays and Wednesdays some of that every day of your life you can stay and you can stay revived and you can feed on my word every day I can reveal things to you sweet things amen I just don't get fed anymore I just don't get fed anymore I hear people say sometimes and I get scared what if I relied on Donnie Reagan's Ministry or some other Ministry well I gotta feed on them and I gotta feed you know and or or or or I'm not going to have anything sure I listen to some sometimes and so forth that's perfectly fine but I get my Mana fresh from God I mean and I believe every believer can do that you can do that wherever you are Lord reveal it Quicken this to me and Quicken that to me if you have living that Shekinah Glory when you're at school living that kind of Glory when you're on your job or wherever you are to stay in that you kind of go keep it with you all the time you don't have to go to here you don't have to go to sushi you ain't got to go all that ain't that Prophet brought us into the presence of almighty God that we can live there let me throw this ball into the end zone shall we oh my you love him oh there's many people tonight professing Christianity who's dead who doesn't bear any fruits there's nothing in their life they seem to be helpless hopeless and wander along just knowing that they belong to a church and that's not only Presbyterian and Lutheran that's Pentecostals can we say that's message people too that's right it's the truth amen what you need today is a coming before Christ look what happened I noticed whenever Aaron's uh Aaron's Roth talking about Aaron Rod being brought in there not only did it Blossom but it forced through that's the way you'll be every believer that throws himself from the outside from these outer courts into the Avail where Christ is he hides your life away you'll be refreshed you'll be butted you'll Blossom and you'll bear fruits into the spirit hey man you'll be a worker in your community you'll be a sole winner for Christ you'll be a new person all things have passed away traditions of men will fail but your heart will be burning with the love of God how the thing was refreshing the presence notice another thing what's in the presence of God you get quieted you get quieted touch your hands forth be no more children Ephesians 4 and verse 14 talk to and for carried about with every wind of doctor about a slide of men but a common craftsness whereby live why and wait to deceive yeah amen not the scripture I was looking for first Peter 4 and verse 10 but the but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you and you amen oh my I'll tell you what when you're young a teenager you have insecurities you have inferiorities well I want to be like this and I want to be like that I know I'm not as pretty as this and I'm not strong as that one I'm not as good as this and I'm not good at that and will this girl like me or will they do that or do the other and you're just insecure how do you know brother bother because well I was that way but when I come to Christ it settled me I didn't have to prove anything to anybody anymore I was settled I have Christ now I know who I am I don't have to have anything for a complex why because you got Christ on your side now you don't have to worry about to be in the toughest the strongest the best looking or this that or the other and all these other things you ain't got to worry about all that Christ is your head now he controls you it settles you Peter said be established stabilize you settle you but Abraham says it quiets you not just toss about everything you know where you're standing there's something that happens amen you know that you're a real Christian you know that you've been in contact with somebody that loves you you know that there's something happening down here it's refreshing not only that but you'll refresh others amen how many believe that you'll refresh others listen a person that's in here my last quote you can meet that man that's in that test ever walking there and I don't care if he hasn't been in the Revival for six months he's just as sweet as the day that he was in the Revival how many wants to be that way and I meet you in six months now you're gonna be as happy as free and as revived as you ever was [Music] because you're not having to be revived you are living in the presence of the king just as sweet as though he was in Revival that's right you can meet him on a shouty day or a cloudy day or whatever you want to he's just the same because living in the glory of God he's living with a man is fresh all the time where it's another burn to get out and pray through today and pray through

between there too Paul said cease without praying amen it's not a burden to pray you don't have to push him to pray through the day and pray through tomorrow brother stay with him all the time in the
